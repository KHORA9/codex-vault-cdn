Man never will know a wonderless world. In the\r\nphenomena of life especially we have come only to the zone of morning\r\ntwilight. The bright day of understanding is ahead. As its hours pass\r\nwe can expect a constant succession of new paradoxes, new spurs to\r\nfurther advances.\r\n\r\nMan would be in a sad situation were it otherwise. For the bright light\r\nof noon and afternoon inevitably precedes sunset and darkness and sleep.\r\n\r\nThis book is a compendium of some of Nature’s curiosities and\r\ncontradictions in the field of life and as such it well may awaken that\r\nwonder which, as somebody has said, is the beginning of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe author is one of the world’s best-known and most respected science\r\nwriters. This book is a personal and unique distillation of the wisdom\r\nhe has developed in a lifetime of dealing with man’s effort to resolve\r\nthe paradoxes of nature.\r\n\r\n  LEONARD CARMICHAEL\r\n\r\n  _Secretary of the\r\n  Smithsonian Institution_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nLife has invaded nearly every crack and crevasse of the world during\r\nthe billion years since it left its first traces on this planet. It\r\nhas adjusted itself to all extremes of living, from nearly airless\r\nmountaintops five miles high to lightless floors of oceans five miles\r\ndeep. It has found abodes in boiling hot springs and in the everlasting\r\nice of Antarctic peaks. It very likely has invaded the cold, red\r\ndeserts of Mars. Everywhere it has succeeded in altering the garments\r\nit wears to meet the stresses it has experienced.\r\n\r\nIt has achieved semi-infinite variety. There are approximately a\r\nquarter million species of plants now known in the world. Most abundant\r\nand varied life is that of the insects who may be on their way to\r\ndisplace man and his fellow mammals as lords of the earth. A rough\r\nestimate of the number of species identified up to now is 800,000.\r\nSeveral thousand hitherto unknown are described each year. Of mammals,\r\nincluding man, there may be as many as 14,000 distinct species and\r\ngeographic races extant. About 8,500 species of birds are catalogued.\r\nSub-species and geographic races increase this number to about 30,000.\r\nKnown fishes number 40,000 species and sub-species.\r\n\r\nStill, naturalists say, there are great mansions of life almost unknown\r\nto man. The collections of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington\r\ngrow at the rate of about a million specimens a year, always including\r\nforms hitherto uncatalogued. Much of the material in the following\r\npages is based on Smithsonian information, although other sources and\r\npersonal observations have been liberally drawn upon.\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian specimens, as well as those in other museums and\r\ncollections throughout the world, are types. Once they were individuals\r\nwith passions, fears, hungers, perhaps some dim wonderings and\r\nquestionings. The type is the eternal reality. The individual is the\r\nbrief-lived example of this reality, the flame of a candle fluttering\r\nin a windy moment.\r\n\r\nI have brought together in these pages notes about the most\r\nextraordinary manifestations of nature that have come to my attention\r\nin the course of thirty years as a science reporter. Each example is,\r\nof course, based upon a distinctly individual expression of nature, but\r\nall are very much interrelated in this truly amazing world of ours.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS R. HENRY\r\n\r\n _Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Invisible Underground Jungle_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may be as many as twenty-five million invisible plants and\r\nanimals in a gram of soil about the size of a grain of sand. It would\r\ntake a thousand such grains to make a marble.\r\n\r\nThe population of this microscopic jungle is composed chiefly of\r\nsingle-celled organisms—bacteria, molds, yeasts and protozoa. Total\r\nnumbers vary enormously—from time to time and place to place—chiefly\r\nbecause of variations in the food supply. Although thousands of species\r\nhave been identified, the greater part of soil life still remains\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThis jungle is a place of the hunter and the hunted—of an incessant and\r\nmerciless struggle for survival. Invisible plants eat invisible animals\r\nand invisible animals eat invisible plants. Plants devour other plants\r\nand animals devour other animals.\r\n\r\nGiants of this nether world—largely invisible, although the average\r\nsize is more than a thousand times that of the bacteria—are thread-like\r\nwhite worms from a hundredth to a fifth of an inch long. Relatively\r\nthey are not very plentiful—less than six million to a cubic foot of\r\nsoil in most places. In both size and numbers in the earth population,\r\nthey are like elephants compared to mice. Still they probably are\r\nnumerically the most abundant of all animals which consist of more than\r\na single cell. In the entire animal kingdom only the protozoa outnumber\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThese creatures are the nematodes, or eel worms. About ten thousand\r\nkinds have been described; there are probably as many more unknown\r\nto zoologists. Less than a hundred of these varieties cost American\r\nfarmers and gardeners more than half a billion dollars a year. The rest\r\nof those species living in the soil are, so far as known, harmless\r\nor even slightly beneficial. Seas and fresh waters are full of other\r\nkinds. Still others, some very much larger than the soil organisms, are\r\namong the most dangerous parasites of animals and men. The little soil\r\nworms, in the opinion of Dr. Geoffrey LaPage of Cambridge University,\r\n“must be considered one of the major menaces of our civilization.”\r\n\r\nAlthough always invisible, the activities of these countless billions\r\nof organisms underfoot can be measured in various ways. For example,\r\ncarbon dioxide is constantly escaping from the surface of the ground.\r\nThis comes from the breathing of the unseen animals and plants.\r\nMeasurement of the gas outflow gives a rough estimate of how many are\r\npresent. It shows that the numbers vary greatly from hour to hour.\r\n\r\nThe soil organisms are relatively immune to heat and cold, flood and\r\ndrought. Even when a grain of soil has been made absolutely dry in the\r\nlaboratory and then crushed to a very fine powder, they still remain.\r\nIf it is placed in a sterile container filled with some fermentable\r\nmaterial, a seething mass of microörganisms will appear in a few hours.\r\n\r\nSome day this vast, unseen mass of life may be harnessed to the service\r\nof man. Only beginnings have been made to achieve this end. Some of\r\nthe microscopic life forms are definitely helpful to plant life, while\r\nothers undoubtedly are destructive. One service, without which plant\r\nlife would be unable to continue very long, is the fixation in the soil\r\nof nitrogen from the air. One group of bacteria, the azotobacteria,\r\ndo this in the laboratory and long have been supposed to be the\r\neffective agents in nature. But actual examination of soil samples, say\r\nDepartment of Agriculture specialists, fail to show more than a few\r\nthousands of these organisms per gram of soil anywhere, and sometimes\r\nnone at all can be found in places where it is known that nitrogen\r\nfixation is in progress. Some still unknown form of microscopic life\r\nmust be doing part of the work.\r\n\r\nAnother unknown organism is an agent partly responsible for breaking\r\ndown the cellulose of dead plants in the soil. The mold, Aspergillus\r\nfumigatus, world-wide in its distribution, does this in the laboratory.\r\nNowhere, however, is it found in nature in sufficient numbers to\r\naccomplish the titanic job attributed to it.\r\n\r\nThe great, invisible jungle, of course, must eat to live. Some\r\norganisms demand fresh food and are responsible for root rot in plants.\r\nThe majority, however, find their sustenance in the enormous mass of\r\ndead and dying roots of annual vegetation. Decomposition of annuals is\r\nan explosive process involving the development of countless billions of\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Self-Perpetuating Sponge_\r\n\r\n\r\nClose to primaeval chaos is the sponge—lowliest of animals. It is an\r\nanimal without a brain, nervous system, heart, lungs, stomach, muscles\r\nor blood. But it has an _I Am_.\r\n\r\nThe sponge is in essence an anarchical horde of numberless cells.\r\nWhen the conglomeration is split up as can be done by a technique of\r\nsqueezing through fine-meshed silk gauze, the cells continue to live as\r\nindividuals. They crawl about. They take nourishment. But when a few\r\nthousands of them are thrown together into a tank of sea water they\r\nwill conglomerate again, apparently into the same sponge that existed\r\nbefore the disintegration. If sponge animals of two different species\r\nare mixed in the tank they will combine into two sponges, duplications\r\nof the conglomerations from which they came. If cells of two sponges\r\nof the same species are mixed it may be that they will recombine into\r\nthe two original individuals—but this experiment never has been tried\r\nand would be quite difficult to interpret.\r\n\r\nThe sponge is the simplest, most primitive of metazoa, or many-celled\r\nanimals. It acts as an individual, although there is apparently no\r\ncentral government, like a brain, controlling the behavior of the\r\nmillions of individuals constituting the conglomeration. It ranges\r\nin size from organisms a fraction of an inch long, by far the most\r\nnumerous, to masses several feet in diameter. Various species present\r\nabout all the colors of the rainbow. There are red, scarlet, green,\r\nyellow, blue and violet sponges, especially in shallow, tropical\r\nwaters. Abysmal species tend to be a drab brown.\r\n\r\nThe living sponge when taken from the water is a slimy, rather\r\nrepulsive mass which has the general appearance of a piece of raw beef\r\nliver perforated with holes and canals. The commercial sponge is merely\r\nthe skeleton, the supporting framework of the gelatin-like tissues,\r\nwhich is composed of a substance similar in chemical and physical\r\nproperties to silk, horn and the chitin which forms the shells of\r\ninsects and crabs. This material is distributed in a fibrous network\r\nthe pattern of which varies for each species.\r\n\r\nThe sponge has the most remarkable powers of regeneration of lost parts\r\nknown in nature. It can regrow its entire body from a small fragment\r\nof itself. Thus if a sponge were cut into fine parts and each fragment\r\ncemented to a bit of rock each would grow into a complete, normal\r\nanimal. Also if a sponge is cut or torn away from the sea bottom in\r\nsuch a way that some fragment remains attached this fragment will\r\ncontinue growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Living “Stars” in Caves_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a cathedral-like grotto under the earth whose roof is lit\r\neternally by living stars. It is an enormous labyrinthine chamber cut\r\nby a slow-flowing river in the base of a limestone mountain.\r\n\r\nIts dome is like the dome of the heavens on a frosty October night.\r\nThere shine the Big Dipper, the Southern Cross and the Belt of Orion.\r\nThe Clouds of Magellan are on the southern horizon. There are millions\r\nof pale stars grouped in all sorts of astrological configurations.\r\nSome are isolated in space. Some are packed in dense galaxies. There\r\nare black voids between them, like the curtain of star dust that hides\r\nthe center of the universe. They are only a few feet overhead. One can\r\nreach up and pluck these stars, one by one, out of the sky. Unlike the\r\nheavenly bodies, they do not twinkle. They shine steadily in complete\r\nmotionlessness. Pale and weird, they illumine a realm of eternal night.\r\nIt is a domain of absolute silence. Around the walls the strange\r\nstarlight falls on carved figures of winged angels, of human faces\r\nlaughing and human faces contorted in agony. Each star is a predacious\r\nliving animal, a flesh-hungry hunter and killer. From it is suspended\r\nfour or five foot-long strings of shining pearls, so delicate that they\r\nshimmer at a human breath.\r\n\r\nThis star-lit cave near the little city of Te Awaamutu is New\r\nZealand’s greatest curiosity and certainly one of the weirdest and\r\nmost intriguing spots on earth. The grotto constitutes about a third\r\nof the Waitome caverns in the center of Maoriland in the North Island,\r\notherwise rather featureless, water-chiseled rooms in the depths of a\r\nmountain with the customary stalagmite and stalactite formations.\r\n\r\nThe stars are luminous, slimy, dirty-grey worms. They are rarely found\r\nanywhere else, and never in very great numbers. This is the one spot on\r\nearth ideally adapted to their unbelievably queer life cycle. The worm\r\nis the larva of a dainty, dark-winged fly about twice as large as a\r\nmosquito, which looks like a miniature daddy longlegs. It has no common\r\nname. Scientifically it is classified as Boletophela luminosa, a member\r\nof the sub-order of arachenocampa. It falls somewhere between true\r\ninsects and spiders. There is no relationship between it and any other\r\nluminous insect—glow-worm or firefly—anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe light is a lure for prey to satisfy a voracious appetite. The\r\nlovely strings of pearls are modifications of the spider’s web. Nature\r\nhas provided few other creatures with so intricate and ingenious a\r\nfood-gathering mechanism as that which enables this *none* to survive\r\nin its strange environment Here evolution has schemed in an unique way\r\nto ensure the preservation of a species which apparently serves no\r\npurpose in the economy of nature except to procreate a beauty spot\r\n\r\nThe floor of the glow worm grotto is a subterranean branch of a river.\r\nThe water is warm and almost absolutely motionless, for no breezes\r\npenetrate that far under the mountain. Thus it is an almost ideal spot\r\nfor all sorts of insects to lay their eggs. There is a high probability\r\nthat the great majority of them will hatch. As the young rise from the\r\nwater they are attracted by the star-filled heavens overhead. They\r\nfly toward them as moths to a lamp. The same is true of many of the\r\nsmall adult insects, some of which are essentially microscopic. Once\r\nsuch an insect is caught on one of the threads it is lost beyond all\r\nhope. There it sticks, struggle as it may. The vibrations caused by its\r\nstruggles attract the attention of the glow worm which quickly winds\r\nup the hanging thread. If it is not hungry at the moment it has been\r\nobserved to play with its victim, drawing in and then letting out the\r\nline after the manner of a fisherman. Finally the prey is drawn into\r\nthe silken sheath and entirely devoured, chitinous shell and all. It is\r\nnot merely sucked, as is the fashion of the spider or the fly.\r\n\r\nThe “lamps” apparently are under an extremely delicate nervous\r\ncontrol. The strings of pearls suspended loosely in the air must be\r\nextraordinarily sensitive to sound waves. The instant they pick up any\r\nsound unusual for the cavern the lights automatically go out. Stranger\r\nstill is the fact that the darkening of all the stars is nearly\r\nsimultaneous. This, of course, is a safety measure. Any disturbance\r\nof the cave routine means danger for the transparent caterpillars. In\r\norder to see the star-lit heavens effect the row boat in which one\r\nenters the glow worm grotto must be handled by skilled oarsmen so that\r\nthere is no sound of splashing water. Visitors are warned not even to\r\nwhisper, lest some string be disturbed and instantaneously transmit the\r\nwarning to all the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parenthood Among Penguins_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of nature’s miracles is the egg-laying and incubating of the\r\nemperor penguin in the darkness of the Antarctic night at temperatures\r\nof from 50 to 80 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nDr. Edward Wilson, surgeon of Sir Robert Falcon Scott’s 1901 south\r\npolar expedition, found the first emperor rookery and was able to\r\nobserve it for several days. His account became one of the classics of\r\nscience. The big birds hatched their eggs, he found, standing on one\r\nfoot on the ice and holding them against the breast feathers with the\r\nother foot. The task evidently was shared by both males and females.\r\nThe male would take the egg from the female while she trekked to open\r\nwater to feed on fish. After a few days, Wilson supposed, she would\r\nreturn while the male went after fish.\r\n\r\nIn 1956 Dr. Bernard Stonehouse of the Falkland Island Dependencies\r\nAdministration found another emperor rookery and maintained\r\nobservations for about ten weeks. The behavior observed was even more\r\nof a miracle than Dr. Wilson supposed.\r\n\r\nAfter laying their eggs on the ice, Stonehouse noticed, the females\r\nleave immediately for open water and remain there for sixty days, the\r\nfull period of incubation. Presumably they feed constantly during this\r\nperiod. The males take over entirely at the rookery. For two months\r\nthe husband remains standing on one foot and holding an egg against\r\nhis breast with the other—presumably shifting his feet now and then.\r\nThrough the entire hatching period he eats nothing. When the eggs are\r\nabout to hatch the mothers return from the sea, tidy up the nursery,\r\nand get ready to take over rearing the chicks. Then the males, who\r\nhave exhausted their reserve of fat, stagger feebly in their own mass\r\nmigration to open water to rebuild their reserves on fish. By the time\r\nof the Antarctic sunrise in October the chicks are about ready to fend\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nStanding from three to four feet high and looking and acting\r\ndeceptively like a human being, the emperor penguin undoubtedly is one\r\nof the most remarkable birds in existence. It presumably is confined to\r\nthe Ross Sea side of the Antarctic continent. The bird—actually it is\r\nabout two-thirds feathers—remains an evolutionary enigma. Theories have\r\nbeen advanced that it is the last surviving member of the fauna of the\r\nAntarctic continent about fifty million years ago when the shorelines\r\nwere free of ice. It certainly is off any known road of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Strategy of Warrior Ants_\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal war is the way of life for army ants. The picturesque,\r\ndevastating drives of their vast hordes have nothing whatever to do\r\nwith exhaustion of food or anything of the sort. The wars come in fixed\r\ncycles, regardless of supplies.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of these ants on Barro Colorado Island in the\r\nPanama Canal Zone. Each species has approximately 50 colonies and each\r\ncolony consists of from a few hundred thousands to more than a million\r\nindividuals. At the head of each colony is a single queen who lays all\r\nthe eggs.\r\n\r\nThere is a new lot of larvae every 33 days—all workers or incompletely\r\ndeveloped females. Development is restricted by the amount of food\r\navailable. Since each brood consists of about 60,000 individuals, a\r\ncolony theoretically might reach titanic proportions. However, it does\r\nlittle more than maintain its population. The death rate of soldier\r\nants, in constant combat, is very heavy.\r\n\r\nOnce each year, at the start of the dry season in the tropics, a colony\r\nqueen produces a sexual brood of about 3,000 males and six queens. The\r\nrest of the 60,000 eggs laid at this time are incapable of hatching and\r\nare fed to the new-born sexed individuals. They apparently have some of\r\nthe nutritious properties of the royal jelly fed to queen bees.\r\n\r\nThis sexual brood is produced in what has been called a statory period\r\nin which the army maintains a fixed bivouac for about three weeks.\r\nDuring this time the new queens develop and around at least one of them\r\na new group of workers, about half the whole, tends to congregate. A\r\nstrange antagonism seems to develop between the old and new groups.\r\nEventually the colony divides in two and each half starts moving in\r\nopposite directions. The other new queens are lost in the shuffle.\r\n\r\nMost of the newly developed males are ‘excess baggage.’ During the\r\nwinged, or mating, stage they fly into the forest where the great\r\nmajority of them are eaten by birds. When the surviving ants light on a\r\ntree, on the ground or on some other object, the wings drop off. Then\r\nthey apparently wander about aimlessly until they come to an army ant\r\ntrail which they recognize by the odor and follow it until they come to\r\nthe colony which has made it. If this happens to be a colony of their\r\nown relatives, they probably are killed by the workers. If it happens\r\nto be an entirely foreign colony, they may be accepted. This apparently\r\nis one of nature’s mechanisms for intruding new genes into a strain.\r\n\r\nThe raiding activities of a colony are carried out during the day from\r\na central headquarters. During the daytime raiding individuals return\r\nto the colony from their forays and by dusk all have returned. At\r\nnight the bivouac is changed, the whole colony moving forward along\r\none of the trails blazed by the raiders. A new headquarters is thus\r\nestablished. A colony moves from six to seven hours before striking a\r\nnew bivouac. Not infrequently, if no promising site is found, it moves\r\nfrom dusk to dawn.\r\n\r\nThis would seem like constant activity, too strenuous even for the\r\nconstitution of an army ant. Actually the individual workers probably\r\nget plenty of rest. Each colony is divided into two units—the raiders\r\nand those that constitute the structural unit. The walls of the\r\n“headquarters” are made up of the bodies of the latter. These “living\r\nbrick” do nothing throughout the day. They may be asleep. When the\r\nraiders return at dusk the structural unit breaks up and the members\r\nlead the migration to a new bivouac. The erstwhile raiders follow\r\nleisurely in the rear and in turn become the structural unit when a\r\nstopping place is selected.\r\n\r\nWhen to rest? When to raid? There apparently is an irresistible war\r\nrhythm, like the rhythm of the tides, in the basic constitution of\r\nthese ants. Some have postulated the same sort of thing, on a lesser\r\nscale, in man who goes to war every so often but camouflages the war\r\ntide with economic or political explanations.\r\n\r\nThese ants are remarkable not only as warriors but as architects.\r\nThey build complex, air-conditioned, hanging houses out of thousands\r\nof their own suspended bodies. Within these structures the queen is\r\nsheltered, eggs laid, young hatched and reared. Much of the time the\r\n“houses” are constructed anew each night.\r\n\r\nThis home-building behavior is unique in nature, as Dr. T. C. Schneirla\r\nof the American Museum of Natural History has pointed out:\r\n\r\n“Without any active excavating and without any manipulating of fallen\r\nmaterials, colonies of these species form a domicile with their own\r\nbodies. A typical bivouac is a cylindrical mass hanging from the\r\nunderside of some projecting surface to the ground. In addition to the\r\nsides or under-surface of logs, other typical places are the spaces\r\nbetween gut tressed tree roots, masses of brush, undercut banks of\r\nstream beds, or the overhanging edge of a rock.\r\n\r\n“The characteristic ability to cluster their bodies, as well as\r\nthe manner of clustering, depends first of all upon an anatomical\r\ncharacteristic—the opposed, recurved hooks on the terminal tarsal\r\nsegments of the workers’ legs. The first ants to settle in a new place\r\ncatch into a rough or soft surface by means of the tarsal hooks, or\r\nrather are pushed into this anchored position as newcomers run upon\r\nthem as they stand and stretch them out in a hanging position. In fact,\r\nthe hooks are really anchored by the added weight of others that have\r\ncrawled down over the body of the first ant, fixing it in place and\r\nsoon immobilizing it.\r\n\r\n“In the nomadic phase a new bivouac is formed at the end of each day of\r\nraiding. In the advanced and most complicated stages of raiding in the\r\nafternoon, caches of booty tend to be formed at each busy junction of\r\nraiding trails, increasing in size as more and more ants are knocked\r\naround and forced out of traffic. As darkness comes and raiding ceases\r\nsuch clusters grow. Several hanging clusters start from elevated\r\nceilings. As each new cluster begins, the initial slender hanging\r\nthreads may become ropes which extend to the ground. As the ropes\r\ncontinue to grow they are joined together into a single columnar mass.\r\n\r\n“At first this mass is small in diameter, but as more and more ants\r\npour into it the wall spreads outwards from the center and so a\r\nsymmetrical cylinder results.”\r\n\r\nIn the tropical environment of the army ants some sort of air\r\nconditioning is necessary for comfortable living—perhaps, with this\r\nparticular species, for any living at all. It has been well developed\r\nduring the more than 50 million years the insects have been on earth.\r\nSays Dr. Schneirla:\r\n\r\n“The interior of the bivouac, where the brood is sheltered and the\r\nsingle colony queen rests, offers an impressively stable environment to\r\nthese more susceptible members of the community as well as a central\r\nresting place for the worker population. The hanging cluster traps\r\na cubic area for atmosphere which does not reach the extremes of\r\ntemperature and dryness attained by the general forest environment,\r\nbut in general is somewhat warmer and more humid at night and somewhat\r\ncooler and dryer during the day.\r\n\r\n“This result is achieved mainly as a result of worker behavior. Workers\r\ncluster more closely together at night in reaction to the lower\r\ntemperature of the forest at the time. The bivouac walls become tighter\r\nand thus better conserve heat produced internally by the brood.\r\n\r\n“Conversely, after dawn, when increasing light excites growing numbers\r\nof ants to leave the bivouac, as the raid grows, this wall thins out,\r\nusually develops small apertures, and is undercut at the bottom. The\r\neffect is to increase internal air circulation as well as to cool the\r\natmosphere of the interior through evaporation, so that the internal\r\ntemperature of the bivouac does not rise to the height reached at\r\nmidday in the environs.\r\n\r\n“The incubation properties of the bivouac represent an important factor\r\nin echelon life, for with less regular atmospheric conditions in the\r\nnest the stages of brood development could not have their typical\r\nregularity in timing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uganda’s Miniature Dinosaur_\r\n\r\n\r\nA grotesque creature abundant in the Kishasha Valley of Uganda is\r\nthe three-horned chameleon. It grows to a length exceeding twelve\r\ninches and the males look like miniature versions of the ancient\r\ndinosaur monster, triceratops. Three curious horns, an inch to an\r\ninch-and-a-half in length, protrude from the nose and between the eyes\r\nof males.\r\n\r\nThese are extremely pugnacious animals; they use their horns in fights\r\nto the finish. At times the contests develop into prolonged pushing\r\nmatches with the horns interlocked, but a really vigorous fighter can\r\ndispose of an adversary in a few minutes. African natives are terrified\r\nof these demoniacal-looking little animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Strange Ways of Spiders_\r\n\r\n\r\n“With other classes of animals, and even with plants, man feels a\r\ncertain kinship—but spiders are not of his world. Their strange\r\nhabits, ethics and psychology seem to belong to some other planet\r\nwhere conditions are more monstrous, more active, more insane,\r\nmore atrocious, more infernal than on our own. Frightfulness and\r\nruthlessness appear a part of their nature and we stand appalled when\r\nit dawns upon us that they are far better armed and equipped for their\r\nlife work than we for ours.”\r\n\r\nThus writes Dr. W. E. Stafford, U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nnaturalist. There probably is quite general agreement with his\r\nsentiments. One chills at the picture of some other planet where\r\nspiders and their kin who have evolved minds equal to that of humans\r\nare the dominant animals.\r\n\r\nOnce gigantic spider-like creatures ruled this world. They were as\r\nbig as lions or gorillas. Their realm was the earth of the Silurian\r\ngeological era of 350,000,000 years ago—a time of warm, quiet seas\r\nwhich, especially in the northern hemisphere, covered large areas\r\nthat now are dry land. These creatures were the euripterids, or sea\r\nscorpions, whose nearest extant relatives are the horseshoe crabs with\r\nsky-blue blood that are common along the Atlantic coast of the United\r\nStates, and the venom-fanged land scorpions. They exceeded in size all\r\nliving invertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nMany were five to six feet long; one was nine feet long. Presumably\r\nthey were free-swimming, predacious creatures with massive, crushing\r\njaws. Their chief prey, it is believed, were the much smaller,\r\ncrab-like trilobites with whom they shared a common ancestry. These\r\nwere shelled animals the imprints of whose hard shells in mud (which\r\nlater became rock) are among the most ancient records of animal life on\r\nthis planet. The trilobites were creatures who crawled on shallow sea\r\nbottom. Their only defense was to roll themselves in balls. They appear\r\nto have been the dominant form of life for at least 100,000,000 years.\r\nThey continued a precarious existence after the evolution of the great\r\npseudo-spiders, but were well on their way to extinction. The massive\r\njaws of the euripterids could crush their thin shells with ease. The\r\ndominance of these new masters of the sea would be challenged only by\r\nthe gigantic mollusks, but for many millenia they appear to have held\r\ntheir own against these frightful monsters.\r\n\r\nTheir decline had started by the end of the Silurian period and\r\nthey were extinct in another hundred million years. The reason for\r\ntheir decline is unknown, but perhaps it was related to some decided\r\nchange in temperature and distribution of the waters. Remarkably\r\nwell preserved remains of the monsters have been found imbedded in\r\nlimestone on Oesel Island, in the Baltic. During the Silurian era\r\nlife was just starting to emigrate from the oceans and establish a\r\nprecarious foothold on land. Among the earliest land fossils are those\r\nof small scorpions, distantly related to the erstwhile master race. The\r\neuripterids themselves, however, never tried to leave the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms With a Thousand Eyes_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are worms with a thousand eyes. They are, for the most part,\r\nanimals of the dank, dark floors of tropical rain forests.\r\n\r\nThey are narrow, brilliantly colored ribbons of slimy skin which glide\r\nat a speed of about six feet an hour over damp moss and leaves in the\r\neverlasting twilight. When alarmed they can break up instantly into\r\nscores of “blobs of slime” and in a few hours each piece will become a\r\ncomplete new worm. One of them can eat five-sixths of its own body and\r\nentirely recover.\r\n\r\nThese fantastic creatures are the terricola or land planarians—lowliest\r\nof worms and one of the lowliest forms of animal life. Only the\r\nmicroscopic protozoa, the slime moulds, the sponges, jellyfish, and\r\ncorals are more primitive.\r\n\r\nThey range from fractions of an inch to nearly a foot in length. They\r\nare hunters and scavengers. Nearly all are creatures of darkness\r\nand dim light—survivors of the haunted dawn of life on earth. They\r\nprobably are quite close to the ancestral form of all worms. All are\r\nfree-living animals, although related closely to the degenerate flukes\r\nand cestodes, which are internal parasites of man and other animals.\r\n\r\nThey belong to an enormous clan. There are several hundred known\r\nspecies and perhaps as many more still unknown. These worms are found\r\nover most of the world but most abundantly in the damp tropical and\r\nsub-tropical rain forests. They are seldom seen in nature although they\r\nare fairly well-known in experimental biology classes, for which they\r\nare purchased from dealers. Australia has about sixty species. America\r\nmay have many more, most of which remain undescribed. One would be\r\nlikely to come upon them only by accident.\r\n\r\nAmong these land planarians are some of the most fantastic creatures\r\nof the animal kingdom. They have been described as “gliding strips of\r\nskin.” The family includes some of the most brilliantly colored of all\r\nliving things. They probably represent the earliest traces of eyes and\r\nbrains in the world.\r\n\r\nThe “eyes” of the terricola are black dots arranged in two parallel\r\nrows along both sides of the back. Some species are two-eyed. Many\r\nvarieties are eyeless. Hundred-eyed worms are quite common. The black\r\ndots are light-sensitive. Presumably they represent the beginning\r\nof vision. By means of them the worms can distinguish between light\r\nand darkness. They also tell the direction from which light comes.\r\nActually, however, planarians without eyes have the same ability, but\r\nthey are slower to react. This is demonstrably true for fresh-water\r\nforms. For most of the land forms at least exposure to strong sunlight\r\nwould be fatal.\r\n\r\nEach of the eye dots has a nerve connection with the brain. It is quite\r\nunlikely, however, that the animals actually see anything, in the sense\r\nof discriminating specific objects in their surroundings. In a few\r\nspecies, however, from two to four of these black dots nearest to the\r\nbrain seem somewhat more complicated than the others. As the faculty\r\nof vision evolves among animals these will become actual eyes and all\r\nthe other light-sensitive spots will be discarded. In most planarians,\r\nhowever, the number of eyes increases with the age of the animal.\r\n\r\nNearly all are predatory meat eaters. They are both hunters and\r\nscavengers. Some pursue, kill, and eat living animals, such as\r\nearthworms and small mollusks, as big as themselves. They apparently\r\nare able to locate their victims at some distances by an already\r\nevolved sense of smell. One blind Brazilian species is said to pursue\r\nearthworms into their burrows several feet underground.\r\n\r\nWhen the victim is overtaken the planarian first enfolds it in its\r\nsheetlike, slimy body. Then from its mouth, always on the underside\r\nof the body near the middle instead of at the head end, it projects\r\nits pharynx, a muscular tube which is part of the digestive system.\r\nFrom this is exuded a substance of some sort which slowly liquifies\r\nthe flesh. Then the liquid is sucked into the body through the mouth.\r\nDigestion then is completed within the digestive tract by special cells\r\nwhich engulf minute particles in the same way as they are engulfed\r\nand digested by one-celled animals, the amoeba. The nature of the\r\ndissolving material exuded from the pharynx is unknown. It is believed,\r\nhowever, to contain a mixture of enzymes such as those found in the\r\nintestinal tracts of higher animals.\r\n\r\nPlanarians may attack healthy animals and overpower them in spite of\r\ntheir violent struggles against being enfolded in the slimy skin. They\r\nare, however, particularly attracted to the sick and injured which they\r\napparently locate by smell. Most of these worms are devourers of dead\r\nflesh. A common method of capturing fresh-water forms is to leave a\r\nbit of liver or other raw meat exposed in an area they are likely to\r\nfrequent. Both water and probably land forms will congregate around it.\r\nThen the collector is likely to have a difficult job. As the naturalist\r\nWilliam Beebe says about one large Venezuelan rain forest species:\r\n“To pry one loose and put it in a bottle is like pouring thick, cold\r\nmolasses mixed with thick glue.”\r\n\r\nTo their activities as scavengers of the forest floor these ancient\r\nworms owe their place in the economy of nature. They normally feed\r\nseveral times a week. When kept without food, however, they can\r\nstay alive for months. They gradually shrink in size as they digest\r\nthemselves. The internal organs are reduced little by little as they\r\nare absorbed for food. The first to disappear are the reproductive\r\norgans. Most planarians have both male and female reproductive systems.\r\nThen come the muscles of the body wall. Never however, do the worms\r\neat their own brains or nervous systems, although the brain may be\r\nreduced greatly in size. The I Am of the worm can devour its vestments\r\nof protoplasm; it cannot eat itself. When food is available again\r\nthe organs are regenerated and return to normal size. Instances are\r\nrecorded where planarians have reduced their length from slightly more\r\nthan an inch to less than a seventh of an inch in six months.\r\n\r\nClosely related to this practice of “eating themselves” is the\r\nremarkable ability of the terricolae to break themselves into small\r\nfragments each of which will regenerate into a complete worm. This\r\ncapacity probably has been a major factor in their survival through the\r\naeons since multi-celled life began on earth. What might seem to be\r\ntheir outstanding weakness in the constant struggle for survival—their\r\nsoft bodies and extremely loose organization—has become their major\r\nstrength. A planarian can lose at least nine-tenths of its body\r\nand still preserve its individual existence. This self-shattering\r\nphenomenon constitutes the worm’s chief defense in emergencies. It\r\ncomes into play when any danger threatens. The regenerating ability,\r\nespecially of fresh-water forms, differs considerably in degree from\r\nspecies to species. Some are unable to regenerate a “brain” out of\r\nfragments of the rear part of the body. Complete in every other\r\nrespect, the remade worms seem incapable of the typical gliding\r\nmovements of the race. They remain quiet most of the time but can\r\nmove forward slowly. A tendency to move in circles has been observed.\r\nFragments from the head section, however, quickly become complete\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nAll planarians actually have heads and a “brain,” of sorts. The latter\r\nconsists of two minute bits of nerve tissue just behind the front of\r\nthe body, oval-shaped and enclosed in a tough capsule. It serves as\r\na center for nerve fibers extending throughout the animal. Here are\r\ncoordinated the stimuli received from light and heat, and possibly\r\nthose from odors and sound. When the worm goes forward, it moves its\r\nhead constantly from side to side. Presumably it is exploring the way\r\nahead for food and danger.\r\n\r\nA terrestrial flat worm’s progress is described as “gliding,” rather\r\nthan creeping or crawling. The outer surface of the body has many\r\nglands from which is exuded a mucus over which it slides. This mucus\r\nquickly hardens. From it can be made slender threads by which the worm,\r\nlike a spider, can lower itself safely from projections. Because of the\r\nglue-like quality of the secretion it is able to climb perpendicular\r\nsurfaces. From the hardened mucous, sometimes mixed with sand, it can\r\nmake for itself a shell into which it can retire for months at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queer Fish, But Definitely_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more than 40,000 kinds of fish in the world. Their habitats\r\nrange from the profoundest depths of the seas to cold lakes and brooks\r\non mountain timberlines. They show a bewildering diversity in their\r\nways of life.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of fish is a Philippine goby, less than a third of an inch\r\nlong and weighing a fraction of an ounce. The largest is the whale\r\nshark, found in all warm seas. Some individuals exceed twenty tons.\r\n\r\nSome fish burrow in the mud, some swim, some walk, some fly, some\r\nbreathe air. Some are timid, some bold and bloodthirsty. Some are\r\nplacid, some easily irritated.\r\n\r\nSome are highly venomous. One, found in Australian waters, weighs\r\nnearly half a ton and has poison barbs a foot long. Some of the\r\ndeadliest are among the most beautifully colored.\r\n\r\nFreshwater fish can sometimes be cut out of cakes of ice in which they\r\nhave been frozen for months at a time, and completely revive. Actually\r\nthe fish themselves are not frozen. The freezing point of their blood\r\nis slightly lower than that of water. They were merely “hibernating”.\r\nThis may happen frequently in nature.\r\n\r\nSome fish seem well on their way to becoming land animals. They can\r\nbreathe in air better than in water.\r\n\r\nSurgeon fish are so-called because of a sharp spine on the tail which\r\ncan produce a cut like that made by a surgeon’s scalpel.\r\n\r\nParrot fish have beaks like parrots with which they scour algae from\r\nthe coral reefs for food.\r\n\r\nGoat fish have two growths under the mouth which look like the chin\r\nwhiskers of goats.\r\n\r\nPorcupine fish, whose skins are covered with sharp spines and which can\r\nfill their sac-like bodies with water or inflate them with air until\r\nthey form a ball about twice their normal size. When the bodies are\r\npuffed up the sharp spines are erected to protect the creatures against\r\ntheir enemies. The inflation is a defense measure which takes place\r\nalmost automatically when the fish is alarmed.\r\n\r\nTrigger fish are creatures with rigid spines which “lock” automatically\r\nwhen the animals are in danger so that they cannot be bent. They can be\r\nunlocked, presumably by a nerve reflex, only by the fish themselves or\r\nby some scientist who knows the precise spinal process to touch.\r\n\r\nSquirrel fish are brilliantly colored little creatures with large\r\ndeep-brown eyes which look like the eyes of a squirrel.\r\n\r\nScorpion fish have bodies covered with venomous spines whose poison is\r\nreputed to be sometimes fatal even to man.\r\n\r\nFlying half-beaks are fish with long, slender upper jaws and\r\npractically no lower jaws. They make long glides over the water and may\r\nrepresent an ancestral form of flying fish.\r\n\r\nThe elephant fish is so-called because of its very rough thick skin\r\nand apparent extreme clumsiness of its body, both characteristics of\r\nthe elephant. Elephantichthys might be likened to a thick leather bag\r\nabout eight inches long stuffed loosely with vital organs. It has a\r\ncartilaginous rather than a bony skeleton. It flattens out when laid on\r\na flat surface out of water. It is almost mollusk likee in the softness\r\nof its body. Its skin is approximately a quarter of an inch long.\r\n\r\nThe aptocyclus, or “rattling fish”, is a close relative of\r\nElephantichthys in Arctic waters. It also seems to be a haphazard\r\nconglomeration of vital organs stuffed in a bag. The fish actually\r\nrattle inside when the skin is not filled with water. All fish of this\r\nfamily live at the bottom of fairly shallow water, firmly attached\r\nto flat stones by disk-like suckers. Although they have the power of\r\nlocomotion they seldom use it, remaining stationary on the bottom and\r\nwaiting for their food to come to them.\r\n\r\nMost fish have a tail fin, usually forked, with which they propel\r\nthemselves, but the rat fish has a body tapering down to a long,\r\npointed extension that looks like a rodent’s tail. They are dwellers\r\nin deep waters all over the world. Some are quite fantastic. One,\r\nMacruroides inflaticeps, consists essentially of a head and a tail\r\nwithout any apparent intermediate body; it looks like an enormous\r\ntadpole.\r\n\r\nPearl fish are minute animals that are sometimes found inside oysters\r\nand clams entirely encrusted with mother-of-pearl. They actually\r\nbecome large pearls shaped like fish. These small, nearly transparent\r\ncreatures sometimes back into the open shell of an oyster or clam that\r\nsnaps once the fish are inside. When this happens the creature perishes\r\nbut sets up an irritation that leads to the pearl secretion over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Love Life Among the Spiders_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is love and courtship among spiders, as among birds and mammals,\r\nbut with a unique—and fatal—difference. An observer thus describes a\r\ncourtship scene in the _Cambridge Natural History_:\r\n\r\n“When some inches from her he stood still. She eyed him eagerly,\r\nchanging her position from time to time. He, raising his whole body\r\non the other side, leaned so far over he was in danger of losing his\r\nbalance which he only maintained by sidling rapidly toward the lower\r\nside. Again and again he circled from side to side, she gazing toward\r\nhim in a softer mode and evidently admiring the grace of his antics.\r\nThis was repeated until we had counted 107 circles made by the ardent\r\nlittle male. He approached nearer and nearer and when almost within\r\nreach whirled madly around and around her. She joined him in the giddy\r\ndance. Again he fell back and resumed his semi-circular motion. She,\r\nall excitement, lowered her head and raised her body so that it was\r\nalmost vertical. Both drew nearer. She moved slowly under him, he\r\ncrawling over her head. Thus the mating was accomplished.\r\n\r\n“A few minutes later, however, the female had eaten her ardent lover.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lace Weavers_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor 300,000,000 years tiny animals have been weaving delicate lace.\r\nThey weave constantly, rapidly and in lovely, open mesh patterns. They\r\nmake a stiff stable lace. Their own limestone entombed bodies are the\r\nthreads. Night and day, millenium after millenium, they weave and\r\nweave, for the curse of weaving is forever upon them. Through time\r\nthey have covered hundreds of square miles with white and green veils.\r\nFor the most part these are fragile and short-lived, but in a few cases\r\nthey have been preserved untorn through the ages.\r\n\r\nThese lace weavers are the bryozoa, or moss animalcules—one of the\r\noldest, most abundant and least known forms of animal life. They have\r\nmuch the same habits as the corals, but the two limestone secreting\r\ncreatures are not even remotely related. The weavers are far higher\r\nin the scale of evolution than the island builders. Their family\r\nassociations long have been in dispute. They have been associated with\r\nthe rotifers and mollusks and even with some unknown ancestral form\r\nleading to the vertebrates. Now, however, it is believed that their\r\nnearest relatives are the nearly extinct brachiopods, or lampshells.\r\n\r\nThe two groups started at about the same time in the Cambrian\r\ngeological period of half a billion years ago, but they followed\r\ndifferent paths of development. Both might be considered\r\nproto-mollusks—very remotely kin to clams and oysters. For milleniums\r\nthe brachiopods flourished in the primaeval seas. During the Permean\r\nperiod, about 300,000,000 years ago, they constituted one of the most\r\nabundant forms of animal life. Now they seem close to the end of the\r\nroad. The weavers are as flourishing, and busy, as ever.\r\n\r\nLike a coral polyp or the larva of a clam, the bryozoan starts life\r\nas an almost invisibly minute, free-swimming creature, usually less\r\nthan a thirtieth of an inch long. After a few weeks it settles on some\r\nhard surface, usually a stone, and secretes its limestone shell. New\r\nindividuals rise from the body of the founder of the colony at various\r\nangles, depending on the particular design of the tapestry being\r\nproduced. Each of the buds, after achieving its coat, sends out new\r\nbuds. This is the weaving process.\r\n\r\nThe outside of the stone coat often is marked with delicate and bizarre\r\ndesigns discernable under a microscope. These designs always are the\r\nsame for members of a colony and quite similar for an entire species.\r\nThey make it possible to identify species in geological formations and\r\nthis eventually may be of considerable importance for oil geologists.\r\nAfter death a colony usually is broken up quickly by wave action. Sea\r\nbottom ooze often is filled with the remains. This ooze, over periods\r\nof milleniums, becomes compacted into rock.\r\n\r\nThe weaving process may be very rapid. A colony, starting with a single\r\nfree-swimming larva, may cover as much as 100 sq. feet. Such colonies\r\nhave been found on a single stone. They often are found on mollusk\r\nshells. At present the bryozoans are economically important chiefly as\r\na menace to the oyster industry. Once they have covered an abandoned\r\nshell, oystermen believe, no other oyster will make use of it. About\r\ntheir only other importance to man comes from the fact that some\r\nfresh-water species may clog water pipes by their rapid growth.\r\n\r\nEvery bryozoan in a colony remains throughout its life a separate\r\nanimal, shut off from its fellows by a wall of limestone and leading an\r\nindependent existence. Nevertheless, in the species pattern it assumes,\r\neach colony acts as if it were a single organism.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a phenomenon unique in nature, every individual appears to\r\nbe two and in some species three animals in one. Each leads its own\r\nlife and dies its own death at its own time. But all make up a single\r\nmicroscopic whole.\r\n\r\nFirst is the zooecium, a limestone-encrusted box of tissue. This is\r\nthe continuing individual. Inside the box is a little tentacled worm,\r\nthe polypide. It contains all the vital organs—the brain and the\r\nnerve, circulatory and digestive systems. It breathes, hunts, eats\r\nand lives quite independently of the zooecium. This polypide usually\r\nis short-lived. It has no excretory system. Poisons pile up. It\r\ndegenerates and dies. When it expires the cells of the zooecium wall\r\nassert themselves. From the dead cells of the polypide they extract\r\nwhat nutritive material is present. The “inside animal” becomes a brown\r\nspeck-like body. Then the zooecium cells sprout a bud which becomes a\r\nnew polypide. This lives its normal life span and suffers the same fate\r\nas its predecessor. Another brown body is the only evidence that it has\r\nlived. This process may be repeated ten or twelve times. Think of a\r\nman, or any other high animal, which could replace over and over again\r\nits entire internal system with another made out of its own skin which\r\nhad eaten its own defunct brain and heart.\r\n\r\nThe relation of zooecium and polypide as it exists in one type of\r\nbryozoa, the so-called “sea mats”, was vividly described by the great\r\nBritish naturalist P. H. Gosse. These are not lace weavers. They form a\r\ncolony which looks like a pale, yellow leaf, such as Gosse found in a\r\nmicroscopic study of a mass of sea weed in which he saw other animals\r\nlike “exquisitely crimson leaves thinner than the thinnest tissue\r\npaper, with tall and elegant dark red feathers and purple filaments\r\neach as fine as a silk worm’s thread.”\r\n\r\n“Each individual cell [zooecium] of the sea mat”, Gosse tell us, “is\r\nshaped like a child’s cradle. Suppose a coverlet of transparent skin\r\nwere stretched over each cradle, leaving an opening just over the\r\npillow. Suppose in every cradle there lies a baby with its little knees\r\nbent up to the chin in that zig-zag fashion in which children often lie.\r\n\r\n“But—the child is moving. A slowly pushed open semi-circular slit of\r\nthe coverlet and we see him gradually protruding his head and shoulders\r\nin an erect position, straightening his knees at the same time. He is\r\nraised half out of bed. His head bursts open and becomes a bell of\r\ntentacles. This baby is the tenant polypide.\r\n\r\n“The chambers themselves show signs of life. Their front doors\r\nsuddenly open, gape widely and shut with a snap. This opening and\r\nshutting is repeated over and over again. The polypide emerges from the\r\ncell slowly and withdraws like lightning at the slightest alarm.”\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, some bryozoans appear to consist of three animals\r\nin one. The third is the so-called avicularium, or bird’s head, also\r\nvividly described by Gosse: “The cells [of this particular species]\r\nare oblong-shaped, and look much like a sack of corn. Just below one\r\nof the spines that crown the summit of the cell on one of the edges\r\nis situated a small lump which bears a remarkable resemblance to the\r\nhead of a bird. It has a strongly hooked beak with two well-formed\r\nmandibles, one of which is removable. You observe it deliberately\r\nopening, like the beak of a bird and then closing with a strong,\r\nsudden snap. The birds' heads are not inhabitants of the cells. They\r\nare not even integral parts of them. The cells have their own proper\r\ninhabitants, each leading its own life and each essentially formed on\r\nthe same plan as that of the baby in the cradle. There is no visible\r\nconnection between its and the bird’s head, which is cut off entirely\r\nfrom the interior of the cell. This head has a muscular system entirely\r\nits own. It seizes small animals but has no means of passing them into\r\nits mouth”.\r\n\r\nThe real function of these avicularia is unknown. They have been\r\npictured as fierce watchdogs kept by the bryozoa for defense against\r\napproaching enemies. Gosse speculates that they may serve indirectly as\r\nhunters, seizing and killing small animals. The disintegrating bodies\r\nof their prey, attract hordes of smaller sea creatures which can be\r\ngathered up by the tentacles of the polypide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ways of Crabs_\r\n\r\n\r\nCrabs that wear clothes, others that carry arms, and still others\r\nthat march like regiments of soldiers are among the curiosities of\r\nAustralia’s Great Barrier coral reef.\r\n\r\nOne crab forces the coral polyp to build a limestone palace for its\r\nabode. The female of this species lodges on the polyp when it is in the\r\nlarval state and causes an irritation which forces the host animal to\r\nbuild up the walls. The resulting house is just big enough for the crab\r\nto move about in comfortably. There always is a door through which she\r\nobtains her food.\r\n\r\nAnother species merely sits on the end of a sprouting coral which,\r\ngrowing outward, makes a long, circular burrow for the crustacean.\r\nThrough this it can move backwards and forwards at will. The forward\r\npart of its body is enclosed in a hard shell the exact color of the\r\ncoral so that when the crab sits at the door of its burrow it cannot\r\nbe distinguished from the coral.\r\n\r\nStill another crab carries two sea anemones, one in each “hand”,\r\nwherever it goes. In its first few months of life it seizes these\r\nplant-flowers—living animals with stalks and petals like flowers which\r\nordinarily are attached to rocks under the water—about the centers\r\nof the stalks. Thenceforth it moves about like a person carrying two\r\numbrellas.\r\n\r\nThe most logical explanation of this behavior is that the anemones\r\nserve as weapons, killing or paralyzing small sea animals which come\r\nin contact with them. This species of anemone has stinging cells in\r\nits disk. These curious weapons are carried by the crab continuously\r\nand seem essential to its life. When one of them is taken away, the\r\ncrustacean moves automatically to grasp it again. When a crab is killed\r\nslowly in alcohol it clings to its weapons even in its death struggles.\r\n\r\nThere are spider crabs which cut and wear clothes. They cut off pieces\r\nof living sponges and place them on their backs. These sponges become\r\nentangled in tiny hairs which protrude through the animal’s shell, and\r\ncontinue to grow until they protrude several inches over the back. Thin\r\nlayers also cover the under part of the body and the legs. Every time\r\na crab sheds its shell, it must make itself a new suit The practice\r\nprobably is beneficial to both animals. The crab, living in a forest\r\nof sponges, looks like a sponge itself and is thus concealed from its\r\nenemies. The sponge benefits by being carried to new food sources.\r\nWhen the shell is shed the sponge simply attaches itself to a rock and\r\ncontinues to grow.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable cases of commensalism in nature has been\r\nfound by Dr. Melbourne Ward, Australian zoologist in a degenerate type\r\nof barnacle which makes its way through the thin shell of one of the\r\nBarrier Reef crabs. It wanders through the blood stream of the crab and\r\nfinally comes to the surface where it forms a little sac for itself.\r\nHere it metamorphoses into another form and sends long, thread-like\r\nfilaments into every part of its host’s body. In some respects it\r\nis like a cancer among higher animals, except that in this case the\r\nmalignant growth is that of an individual animal of another species.\r\nIt lives off the food eaten by the crab but never kills nor apparently\r\nseriously injures its host. The one notable effect, for which there is\r\nno adequate explanation, is that it changes a male crab into a female.\r\n\r\nThe soldier crabs are beachdwellers, about two inches long. They march\r\nacross the hard sand in perfect order, as if they were under the\r\ncontrol of leaders. No “officers”, however, have been observed. When\r\napproached, they burrow rapidly in waves, like a regiment of infantry.\r\nFirst the front rank disappears in the sand, followed in order by those\r\nbehind. The regiment disappears completely in a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe soldier crabs can hardly be driven into the water. When Dr. Ward\r\nsucceeded in pushing a few of them off the shore they were set upon by\r\nferocious small fish which rapidly devoured them. Realization of this\r\ndanger apparently is instinctive in the animals.\r\n\r\nSome of the land-dwelling crabs of the mud flats dig very intricate\r\nburrows with labyrinthine cross and side galleries. Some species live\r\nin a communal life. Each crab has its own burrow, but from each there\r\nis a passage into a large central hall which seems to be a community\r\ngathering place. Other species are intensely individualistic. Each\r\nexcavates an elaborate labyrinth in the mud, considers this its own\r\nhome, and vigorously defends it.\r\n\r\nDuring courtship some of these mud crabs perform dances like the\r\ncourtship dances of birds. The male of one variety, after attracting\r\na mate by his dancing, picks her up bodily in one of his nippers and\r\ncarries her away. Another variety of sand crab seems to have perfected\r\nan engineering technique which still evades human skill—that of\r\nbuilding a burrow in soft, dry sand. These burrows are about two inches\r\nin diameter. The crab is able in some mysterious fashion to compress\r\nthe soft sand into a solid substance with its nippers.\r\n\r\nIn precision of instinctive behavior, Dr. Ward found, these Great\r\nBarrier crabs come quite close to the spiders, their distant relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ticks With Noses in Their Legs_\r\n\r\n\r\nTicks, remote spider relatives, smell with their front legs. When these\r\nlegs are amputated the tick shows no reaction to odors. It cannot smell\r\nblood but will feed on any sort of liquid sucked through a warm, moist\r\nmembrane like the skin. Presumably such a tick in nature recognizes\r\nan animal as a proper source of food by smell, while a combination of\r\nwarmth and moisture from the skin gives a stimulus for feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fourth Realm of Life_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a wind-tossed green-grey ocean between earth and sky. It is a\r\nsea on stilts, the world’s fourth realm of life. There are plants and\r\nanimals of the land, of the water, and of the air—and there are plants\r\nand animals of the canopy of the rain forest, a thousand-mile-wide\r\nbroken belt around the world. It covers several million square\r\nmiles—the jungles of South America extending northward into southern\r\nMexico, the basins of the Niger and the Congo, strips of southern India\r\nand Ceylon, much of New Guinea. Life is rather sparse in the perpetual,\r\ndrenched twilight of the jungle floor. It is abundant in the treetops,\r\nthe habitat of fantastic, and still largely unknown, plants, mammals,\r\nbirds, snakes, toads, frogs and insects. These might be compared to the\r\nflora and fauna of an as yet unexplored continent.\r\n\r\nRain forest trees are, in general, tall, straight, and branchless until\r\nnear their tops, 100 to 150 feet above the ground. There they send out\r\na rich profusion of branches and foliage. This foliage is like a thick,\r\nrough, continuous green blanket held up by tall posts, like a net below\r\ntrapeze performers in a circus tent. The top of the blanket is a place\r\nof intense sunshine. Light grows dimmer and dimmer as it penetrates the\r\nleaves and the branches. Finally, on the jungle floor, there is only\r\nabout a fiftieth as much illumination as on the surface of the canopy.\r\n\r\nIn the canopy four or five kinds of monkeys take the place of man on\r\nearth as the most intelligent and adaptive animals. Primates from\r\nthe beginnings of the race—the weird, squirrel-like animals of the\r\nNorth American dawn age forests fifty million years ago—have been\r\nsemi-arboreal.\r\n\r\nMost abundant in the tree-land are the pretty, playful,\r\ncuriosity-driven, humanlike spider monkeys who play tag and throw\r\nsticks at each other in the lower branches. Best known, although less\r\nlikely to be seen, are the big, black, Satanic-looking howlers.\r\n\r\nBoth of these species, in the long process of adapting themselves to\r\nhigh jungle life, have made third hands out of the ends of their tails.\r\nWith these highly sensitive prehensile organs they not only clutch\r\nbranches but sometimes carry out rather delicate manipulations.\r\n\r\nWeirdest are the black-and-white striped, woolly-furred night monkeys.\r\nThese little racoon-like creatures live in holes far up in the\r\ntreetops. They come out only at night and are seldom seen. They have\r\nenormous eyes which shine like live coals among the leaves when the\r\nlight of a flash lamp catches them.\r\n\r\nProbably the most dangerous single animal of the canopy is the\r\ntamandua, or golden anteater. It is exclusively a treetop creature,\r\nabout the size of a rabbit, with golden-yellow, soft, silky fur. It\r\nlives almost exclusively on termites which it harvests by sticking\r\nits long tongue, covered with a sticky saliva, into their nests. A\r\nprogressive relative of the sloth, it remains motionless apparently for\r\ndays at a time and is a slow, clumsy climber.\r\n\r\nBut woe to anything—jaguar, ocelot, big howler monkey, even man—that\r\nruns afoul of it. It strikes suddenly and fast with its long, curved\r\nscimitar-sharp claws, and always aims at the stomach which it rips\r\nopen. No other creature will venture near a tamandua, except by\r\naccident. Probably it is voiceless, although natives have attributed\r\nto the sinister little anteater a peculiarly weird cry heard in the\r\nmoonlit jungle. This now is believed to be the call of a bird.\r\n\r\nClimbing rats are abundant in the jungle top. They feed, for the most\r\npart, on fruits. Here also is the abode of pigmy squirrels which cling,\r\nheads downward, to the tree trunks with their tails curled over their\r\nbacks, squirrel fashion. These animals are about five inches long,\r\nincluding the tail whose length is about equal to that of the rest of\r\nthe body. There is a tiny, climbing mouse with short, broad feet and\r\nsharp, curved claws. Bats, mostly small, fruit-eating animals, flutter\r\nabout in the darkness. Probably there are few of the big dangerous\r\nvampires in the high treetops. They fare better on the blood of larger,\r\nground-dwelling creatures such as tapir and peccary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rubber-Band Worms that Stretch and Stretch_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a worm ninety feet long. It is the giant of a family of white,\r\nred, yellow, green, purple, and violet worms whose habitat ranges from\r\nsea bottoms to jungle treetops. The worms shoot poison-tipped harpoons\r\nout of their brains. Most can shrink at will to less than a third of\r\ntheir ordinary length. They always shrink when they die. Some can break\r\nup into hundreds of fragments, each of which will grow into a complete\r\nnew worm. They tie themselves into inextricable knots. They build their\r\nhouses from the slime of their own bodies.\r\n\r\nThis class is that of the ribbon worms or nemertina. There are about\r\nfive hundred known species—perhaps as many more are unknown. Still\r\nnear the bottom of animal life, they represent revolutionary advances\r\nfrom the lowest of worms, the planarians, with which they share many\r\ncharacteristics. They have evolved integrated brains and nervous\r\nsystems. They have, for the most part, taken on a true worm shape.\r\nThey have acquired weapons and, in some cases, arsenals of weapons.\r\nThey have eyes that see. They have a digestive system, a mouth near\r\nthe front of the body, and closed blood system through which flows a\r\nliquid which usually is colorless as water. Perhaps they hear. At the\r\ntop of the head in certain species there is a group of cells with hairs\r\nand bristles which may constitute an organ of taste. Along the way of\r\nachieving these advances they have given up a little freedom and a\r\nlittle immortality for a little more efficiency.\r\n\r\nThose best-known are inhabitants of sea shores, especially the\r\nAtlantic coasts of North America and Europe. They live under rocks, in\r\nabandoned mollusk shells, in windrowed masses of sea weed, in thin,\r\nparchment-like tubes which they secrete from their own skin. Their\r\ngeneral appearance is that of a tangled mass of slimy string, but some\r\nmembers of the family have among the most brilliant color patterns\r\nknown in nature.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous organ of these primitive worms is the proboscis,\r\na hollow string which is shot out with great speed and force from the\r\nfront end of the usually cylindrical body. At the end of the string, in\r\nseveral groups, is a sharp-pointed, barbed spear-like stylet with which\r\nthe prey, usually some minute water animal, is speared. The victim then\r\nis drawn back into the mouth by the attached hollow thread. Some groups\r\nhave no stylets. The thread, upon which is a mucilage-like mucous, is\r\nused like a lassoo and coiled tightly around the prey.\r\n\r\nThe proboscis is associated so closely with the brain that, like the\r\nretina of the eye, it has sometimes been considered an extension of\r\nit. The thread often is as long as the worm itself. It is shot out\r\nwith such force that is frequently breaks off and continues to lead an\r\nindependent life for a few hours. A new proboscis always develops.\r\n\r\nWhen coiled, the proboscis rests in the center of the two-lobed brain.\r\nIt is continuously shot out and pulled in and probes the water around\r\nit. Presumably at first it was an extremely sensitive sensory organ\r\nby which the brain was kept aware of its surroundings. The attached\r\nstylet, an offensive weapon, was a later development.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases the thread carries a multitude of unattached barbed\r\npoints, a sort of machine-gun arrangement, which can be hurled in all\r\ndirections in the hope of hitting something. It also carries tiny hooks\r\nby which it can be attached to some object. By means of the attached\r\nline the worm pulls itself forward over beach or sea bottom, its\r\nordinary means of locomotion. It is also able, however, to glide like a\r\nplanarian and to swim.\r\n\r\nNemertinea breath through the walls of the oesophagus, or gullet.\r\nWhen the tide comes in, shore-dwelling species rapidly swallow and\r\neject mouthfuls of salt water. Oxygen to purify the blood is obtained\r\nfrom the water. The blood circulates in two or three vessels. It is a\r\ncolorless plasma in which float both green and red corpuscles.\r\n\r\nThere is little knowledge as to the precise nature of the nemertinean\r\nsensory organs. There are, however, nerve cells in all parts of the\r\nbody and the animal is quick to respond to any irritation, especially\r\nto any chemical change in the water. With an intense stimulus the body\r\nis contracted violently, twisted, and even torn apart. Even a headless\r\nspecimen will move toward food placed nearby. A severed head may\r\ncontinue to creep restlessly for several hours. The headless body moves\r\nonly when stimulated. With most mud-dwelling species it is difficult to\r\nsecure an entire specimen. The slender, fragile body is likely to break\r\ninto many fragments when disturbed. Quite commonly, even without any\r\nparticular disturbance, a large worm will break up into a dozen or more\r\npieces. Each becomes a small, new animal. Some regenerating fragments\r\nsecrete disks of mucous and form cradles, in which they may remain for\r\nmonths while new organs are being formed. Eventually the disk ruptures\r\nand the new worm emerges. There is a specific tendency in some species\r\nthus to reproduce during warm weather, with a brief period of sexual\r\nreproduction during the cold months.\r\n\r\nThese worms are extremely tenacious of life. Even without food they\r\nmay live as long as a year in the proper environment. Ordinarily\r\nthey are quite voracious animals. They eat earthworms, other sea\r\nworms, small mollusks—almost anything soft-bodied which the eternally\r\nactive proboscis can bring to the mouth. There it is sucked into the\r\ndigestive tract. The digestive process is very rapid. Some species\r\nhave distensible mouths. Like snakes, they can devour animals bigger\r\nthan themselves. Some are cannibals. When times are hard they can,\r\nlike planarians, absorb themselves. A case has been known where a\r\nnemertean digested all but a twentieth of its own body in a few months,\r\napparently without any ill effects. The lost tissues were restored as\r\nsoon as food again was available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frog Versatility_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimals of many talents are the frogs. Some grunt like pigs, others\r\ncackle like hens. Some chirp like crickets, others caw like crows.\r\nStill others quack like ducks. There are golden frogs, scarlet frogs\r\nthat play dead, frogs that build houses.\r\n\r\nAll this assembly is found in one small corner of the world,\r\nsoutheastern Brazil. This particular tropical countryside long has been\r\nknown for the abundance and variety of its amphibian life.\r\n\r\nSome of the frogs in this area are particularly notable for their\r\ncoloring. Two are almost solid gold in color. Perhaps the most notable\r\nis Brachycephalus ephippium, which not only is brilliant gold in hue\r\nbut has armor plates of bone on back and head, and whose tadpoles are\r\nnearly three times the size of the adults. All the adults, less than an\r\ninch long, have the armor plate strongly developed, although the shape\r\nand size shows considerable variation. The general form of the bony\r\ndeposition just under the skin, in no way connected with the skeleton,\r\nappears to be typically that of an hour glass across the back with one\r\nor more separate bony islands. Sometimes these islands are fused with\r\nthe hour glass. The adults hide under leaves and fallen tree trunks in\r\nhigh mountain woodlands and come out in large numbers only in rainy\r\nweather. They appear to be rather clumsy creatures. Their gait is a\r\nslow walk.\r\n\r\nThe nightly chorus of certain of the frogs sounds like a regiment\r\nbeating on tin pans. Others have calls that are like the sounds made\r\nby winding a watch or filing iron. The “tin-pan frog” is one of the\r\nmost conspicuous creatures of the region. The chorus of singing males\r\ngives a booming metallic sound which seems at times to be a regular\r\nclanging, like that of a blacksmith hammering on an anvil.\r\n\r\nThe “tin-pan” frog builds its own house—a crater-like structure of mud\r\nprojecting above shallow water within which its eggs are laid during\r\nthe dry season. These nests usually are constructed close to the\r\nwater’s edge. Here the eggs hatch and the young tadpoles are swept into\r\nthe pond by the next heavy rain. The mud walls apparently protect the\r\neggs from depredations by fish. Adults stay in trees except at the time\r\nof egg-laying. The male is said to come to the pond first to build the\r\nnest, before the female arrives to lay the eggs. The frog that quacks\r\nlike a duck is a closely related species. It has a peculiar habit of\r\nswarming. Hundreds may appear at one time in a single tree.\r\n\r\nOne of the golden frogs is about three inches long and almost pure\r\ngold in color. Its voice is like the slow grunting of a pig. It sleeps\r\nduring the day in large leaves of bromeliads, trees of the pineapple\r\nfamily that often hold rainwater in their axils. They sometimes are\r\ndescribed as living “tubs of water.” At night the frogs come down out\r\nof the leaves and go to ponds and streams in the neighborhood in search\r\nof insects. Their leaf sleeping chambers apparently give them complete\r\nprotection from their natural enemies.\r\n\r\nOne gray and brown Brazilian frog, extremely sluggish by day, when\r\nhandled assumes a wooden, dead appearance, with the limbs brought close\r\nto the body and the head bent forward, so that it resembles a patch of\r\nfungus or a chip of wood. Even when left on their backs for a long time\r\nthey continue to play dead.\r\n\r\nA notable singer among the Brazilian tree frogs is Hylabypunctata,\r\nwhose call is a high, frequently repeated tit-tit-tit. When many sing\r\ntogether the chorus is so loud it can be heard nearly a mile away.\r\n\r\nOne brilliant-red-legged frog, brought to Washington by the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, ate nothing for seven months and did not change its\r\nposition for days at a time. Throughout this period it seemed to lose\r\nno weight. At the end of seven months it eagerly ate worms and files.\r\n\r\nA violet frog that lives in the clouds and sings like a bird has been\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Bertha Lutz of the National Museum of Brazil on the\r\nsummit of 10,000-foot-high Mt. Itatiaia in the Mantiquiera mountains.\r\nThis frog, hitherto unknown to science, has a purple back spotted with\r\ngold, bronze and deep yellow. Below the purple is a deep violet blue.\r\n\r\nSince the Mantiquiera mountains, the highest in Brazil, are almost\r\nperpetually cloud-veiled, the little animal appears to be entirely a\r\ncreature of cloudland. Its curious colors perhaps have been borrowed\r\nas camouflage from the sky. It has a weak voice and its song is very\r\nmuch like that of a bird. It is found in swift mountain brooks, part of\r\nwhose courses are subterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Horned Viper Spears Other Animals_\r\n\r\n\r\nBest-known Egyptian cobra is the so-called “spitting serpent” or Libyan\r\nasp. It supposedly has the ability to spit in the eyes of its enemies,\r\nsuch as dogs, and the saliva temporarily blinds the victims.\r\n\r\nThe cobra was a sacred animal in ancient Egypt. It was associated with\r\nthe sun and with royalty. It formed part of the head dress of solar\r\ndeities and was represented in the crowns of kings and queens. Toward\r\nthe end of the 20th dynasty, when it became the custom to preserve\r\nsacred animals, it was embalmed at Thebes.\r\n\r\nThere is a fair possibility that one of the sixteen varieties of\r\nEgyptian cobras was the “asp” with which Cleopatra took her own life.\r\nIt is more probable, however, that she used an even weirder and almost\r\nas deadly snake, the horned viper. This serpent is common on the\r\nfringes of the Egyptian desert. It buries itself in the hot sand, only\r\nits eyes and the top of its head being visible. Its two horns resemble\r\nbarley seed and attract birds within its reach. When disturbed it can\r\nthrow itself forward. It was called “aculum” (spear) by the Romans\r\nbecause of this darting motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The World of Insects_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman naturalist Pliny wrote of ants in the Himalayas “the color\r\nof a cat and as large as an Egyptian wolf.” Pliny naively had accepted\r\ntales of travellers but the actual curiosities of the insect world are\r\nalmost as strange as anything he related. There are bugs that live in\r\nice, bugs that are happy only in near boiling water, snow white bugs\r\nthat dwell deep in the earth, bugs that make their homes in petroleum\r\npools.\r\n\r\nNone are as big as wolves, but the insect world has its giants as well\r\nas its dwarfs. The Atlas moth of India has a wing-spread of nearly a\r\nfoot. An East Indian walking stick is 15 inches long. The Hercules\r\nbeetle of Africa sounds like an airplane in flight. Enormous forelegs,\r\nmore than twice the length of the rest of the body are characteristic\r\nof a black wood beetle which covers a space of eight inches with all\r\nits legs extended. A curiosity of the Malay Archipelago is a “fly with\r\nhorns.” It has protuberances on its head which suggest the horns of a\r\ndeer.\r\n\r\nA South African fly has eyes which extend on stalks from the sides of\r\nits head. The stalks are so long that the measurement from eye to eye\r\nis a third more than the length of the body from head to tail.\r\n\r\nOne blood-sucking insect can distend itself with blood to more than\r\ntwelve times its original weight. As the huge meal is digested the\r\nabdomen contracts like a deflating balloon.\r\n\r\nThe death watch beetle, standby for stories of haunted old castles,\r\nbumps its head on the top of its tunnels in wooden walls to send a kind\r\nof telegraphic message to its mate.\r\n\r\nSome chalcid flies paralyze caterpillars and lay self-multiplying eggs\r\nin their bodies. More than 2,000 larvae may be produced from a single\r\negg deposited in this way.\r\n\r\nA singular ant lion, dweller near the Egyptian pyramids, has a slender\r\nand elongated neck whose caliper jaws seem to be held at the end of an\r\noutstretched arm. The neck, in many cases is far longer than the rest\r\nof the body. It permits the insects to probe for prey in deep crevasses.\r\n\r\nThe goat of the insect world, the drugstore beetle, is known to consume\r\n45 different substances, including the poisons aconite and belladonna.\r\nOther beetles feed on cigarettes, mustard plasters and red pepper. Ants\r\nhave shown themselves resistant to cyanide. In the case of some insects\r\na reduced diet slows down growth. Some wood-boring grubs sometimes\r\nlive in house timbers for years after they have been put in place.\r\nIn one instance an adult beetle emerged from a porch post that had\r\nbeen standing for twenty years. The dried timber lacks the nutritive\r\nqualities of the living tree and the growth of the grub is arrested so\r\nthat long periods pass before it reaches maturity.\r\n\r\nA carnivorous butterfly larva lives in the nests of an Australian ant\r\nwhere it feeds on the young. An especially tough outer shell protects\r\nit from attacks by adults ants.\r\n\r\nThe rat-tailed maggot inhabits stagnant water. It feeds on the bottom\r\nand breathes air through an extensible tube that forms its tail. Like a\r\ndiver obtaining oxygen through an air hose while working on sea bottom,\r\nit is able to remain submerged as long as it desires.\r\n\r\nThe little frog hopper produces its own climate. In spring and summer\r\nsmall masses of froth often appear on grass stems and weeds. Within\r\nsuch a bubble mass, sheltered from direct rays of the sun and kept\r\nmoist by the foam, the immature insect spends its early days. For\r\nmillions of years it has been employing its own primitive form of air\r\nconditioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gigantic Serpents of the Sky_\r\n\r\n\r\nTitanic pink serpents coiled and wheeled in the sky. The earth below\r\nwas plunged in a chill twilight as they shut out the December sun.\r\nThese cosmic reptiles were two or three miles long. They moved about\r\na mile a minute. They made a noise like a tornado punctuated with the\r\nrat-tat-tat of machine guns.\r\n\r\nThus the naturalist John Audubon described a mass passenger pigeon\r\nflight over Kentucky which, he estimated, included more than a billion\r\nbirds. As they came out of the northeast they looked like a gigantic,\r\nlow pink cloud driven by a hurricane. Suddenly they split with almost\r\nmilitary precision into the coiling, snake-like formation as predacious\r\nhawks hovered above them.\r\n\r\nWhen these hawks came, says Audubon, at once with a noise like thunder\r\nthey rushed into compact masses, pressing upon each other towards the\r\ncenter. In these almost solid masses they darted forward in undulating\r\nlines, descended and swept close over the earth with inconceivable\r\nvelocity, mounted perpendicularly so as to resemble a vast column, and\r\nwhen high were seen wheeling and twisting in continuous lines which\r\nresembled the coils of gigantic serpents.\r\n\r\nWhen the birds reassembled from their emergency snake formations,\r\nthey constituted, Audubon estimated, a column one mile broad passing\r\noverhead at the rate of a mile a minute for three hours. Thus the solid\r\nmass of the birds would have covered 80 square miles. Such a monster\r\nwould have required, the naturalist calculated, about nine million\r\nbushels of food a day.\r\n\r\nIt is more than a century since anybody has witnessed such a\r\nphenomenon. Civilization and nature combined to destroy the almost\r\nincalculably vast hordes of pink-breasted birds which, acting in a\r\nweird unison, seemed to the pioneers like cosmic monsters invading\r\nthe earth. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered by hunters. Millions\r\nperished in one great Atlantic storm when, it was reported, the sea\r\nover a radius of three or four miles was covered completely with their\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nThe passenger pigeon long has been extinct. The last survivor of the\r\ntornado-like masses now is mounted and on exhibition at the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. It died in captivity in the Cincinnati Zoological Park at\r\n1 p.m., September 1, 1914. Every year Smithsonian ornithologists get\r\nreports that one of these birds has been seen in some remote forest.\r\nAlmost beyond question, however, these reports are due to the wish\r\nfulfillment of amateur bird watchers.\r\n\r\nThe extant mourning dove sometimes is mistaken for the passenger\r\npigeon. In the west the band-tailed pigeon has been similarly mistaken.\r\nEven expert ornithologists might make such errors from casual\r\nobservations. Although convinced that the bird is extinct scientists\r\ncontinue to investigate any plausible clue to its survival.\r\n\r\nAccording to Smithsonian Institution ornithologists, there is a popular\r\nidea that the passenger pigeon mysteriously disappeared and that,\r\nwhile still enormously numerous, it suddenly ceased to exist. Its\r\nannihilation has been attributed popularly to various natural phenomena\r\nand it has even been rumored that the bird migrated to South America.\r\nThe natural phenomena supposed to have been causative of its extinction\r\nare epidemics, tornadoes, early deep snowstorms, forest fires, strong\r\nwinds while the birds were crossing large bodies of water which caused\r\nexhaustion and death by drowning. Circumstantial reports were published\r\nof immense numbers drowned in the Gulf of Mexico, a region well beyond\r\nthe usual range of the bird. Destruction of the forests undoubtedly was\r\na large detrimental factor in the life history of the pigeons, for the\r\nforests supplied their principal food as well as roosting and nesting\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nA bird accustomed for ages to living together in large numbers and\r\nclose ranks, whether in feeding, migrating, roosting or nesting, might\r\nfind it impossible to continue these functions with greatly reduced and\r\nscattered ranks. It is probably more than a figure of speech to say\r\nthat under these circumstances such a communist bird would lose heart,\r\nnor is it fanciful to suppose that sterility might in consequence\r\naffect the remnants. Our continent is so well known that accounts of\r\nthe presence of living birds must be considered more than doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe mass flights came about once every ten years in the early winter.\r\nThe normal habitat of the pigeons was in the great forests of Quebec\r\nand Ontario. There they were widely scattered, feeding chiefly on\r\nacorns. When snow covered the ground they moved southward, but\r\nordinarily not in great masses. But a periodic failure of the acorn\r\ncrop, of the extent of which the birds seemed to have some mysterious\r\nawareness, caused them to assemble in one body and start a mass\r\nmigration southward, obscuring the sun for hours as they passed beneath\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLike tornadoes, they wrecked forests in their flights. Says the\r\nnaturalist Alexander Wilson: “The roosting places sometimes occupy a\r\nlarge extent of forests. When they have frequented one of these places\r\nfor some time the appearance it exhibits is surprising. The ground is\r\ncovered to a depth of several inches with their dung. All the tender\r\ngrass and under wood is destroyed. The surface is strewn with large\r\nlimbs of trees, broken down by the weight of birds collecting one above\r\nthe other. The trees themselves for thousands of acres are killed as if\r\ngirdled with an axe. The marks of the desolation remain for many years\r\non the spot. Numerous places could be pointed out where, for several\r\nyears after, scarcely a single vegetable made its appearance.”\r\n\r\nAfter these mass migrations from the north the pigeons scattered\r\nthrough the forests in search of food but assembled again in the\r\nspring for egg-laying and hatching. Wilson reported: “Not far from\r\nShelbyville, Kentucky about five years ago, there was one of these\r\nbreeding places which stretched through the woods in a north and south\r\ndirection several miles in breadth and was said to be more than 40\r\nmiles in length. In this tract almost every tree was furnished with\r\nnests wherever the branches would accommodate them.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the young were fully grown numerous parties of inhabitants\r\nfrom all parts of the adjacent country came with wagons, axes, beds\r\nand cooking utensils, many of them accompanied by the greater part of\r\ntheir families, and encamped for several days at this immense nursery.\r\nThe noise was so great as to terrify their horses and it was difficult\r\nfor one person to hear another speak. The ground was strewn with broken\r\nlimbs of trees, eggs and young squab pigeon which had been precipitated\r\nfrom above and upon which herds of hogs were fattening. The view\r\nthrough the woods presented a perpetual tumult of crowding and falling\r\nmultitudes of pigeons, their wings roaring like thunder, mingled with\r\nthe frequent crash of falling timber.”\r\n\r\nThe last great nesting was recorded at Petoskey, Michigan, in 1878. The\r\narea covered is said to have been forty miles long and 30 miles broad.\r\n\r\nSystematic commercial hunting of the birds reached its height shortly\r\nafter the Civil War. In 1879 dead birds were sold on the Chicago market\r\nat 50 cents a dozen. Pigeon hunters made from $10 to $40 a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Limbless Lizard_\r\n\r\n\r\nA supposedly welcome guest in the underground chambers of leaf cutter\r\nants is the amphisbaena, a nearly limbless lizard about a foot long\r\nwhich looks something like a gigantic earth worm. This creature, seldom\r\nseen, ranges from northern Brazil to lower California. When out of its\r\nhabitat the amphisbaena is almost helpless and moves along the ground\r\nwith feeble wriggles. Some species lay eggs; other give birth to living\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Maddening Tarantula_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tarantula of southern Europe—a large, hairy spider—long was\r\ncredited with causing a weird, infectious madness by its bite.\r\n\r\nThe first reported effect of its poison—actually quite mild—is said to\r\nhave been to put the victim into a deep lethargy from which he could\r\nbe roused only by music which set into motion an overpowering impulse\r\nto get up and dance. Once the victim started to dance he could not\r\nstop until he fell to the ground from exhaustion. Then the condition\r\nsupposedly was cured for a year. On the anniversary of the bite,\r\nhowever, the dance was involuntarily repeated. From the tarantula’s\r\nfirst victim the dancing mania allegedly spread like a contagious\r\ndisease through the surrounding countryside. The name still is used\r\nboth for an Italian dance and for the music which accompanies it.\r\n\r\nThe tarantula is a subterranean creature which hibernates in its\r\nburrow during the winter. Bees and wasps are said to be killed almost\r\ninstantly by its bite. The spider always strikes at the junction of the\r\nhead and thorax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Flower That Grows Through Solid Ice_\r\n\r\n\r\nA plant that drills through several inches of solid ice to bloom in\r\nearly spring is the blue moonwort of the Swiss Alps. It belongs to the\r\nprimrose family. In autumn it develops thick, leathery leaves. These\r\nlie flat on the ground, expectant of the snow and ice sheet that may\r\ncover them to a depth of several feet.\r\n\r\nWhen spring arrives and the hot sun melts most of the snow and some of\r\nthe ice, water trickles down to the rootlets and arouses growth in the\r\nsleeping plant. Internal combustion ensues with the floral tissues. The\r\nresulting heat melts the ice about the uprising flower buds and the\r\nstem pushes its way upward. More water flows to the roots and finally\r\nthe plant tunnels a passage to the air and sunshine. So long as the\r\nheat given off from the growing stem and buds is sufficient to prevent\r\nsolid freezing of the parts the plant is indifferent to the surrounding\r\nice cold temperature. It undergoes the usual transformations, is\r\nfertilized by early bees and forms many hundreds of wonderful blue\r\nflower groups which look as if they were beds over a thick layer of\r\ntransparent ice. The leaves are now no longer thick and fleshy, but\r\nthin and papery. They yield up their carbon compounds as fuel to melt a\r\ntunnel through the ice and production of buds and blossoms on a flower\r\nstem above the ice mantle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Versatile Ant Farmers_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are microscopic “farmers” whose fields are measured in fractions\r\nof inches. They are ants—the most widespread fungus-growers in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere. Their range extends from Florida to Brazil. They\r\nare tiny creatures, seldom noticed, who cultivate a species of yeast\r\nwhich is their sole food.\r\n\r\nThe ways of life of this curious ant with the formidable scientific\r\nname of cyphomyrmex rimosus minutus, have been studied throughout their\r\nhabitat by Dr. Neal A. Weber of Swarthmore College.\r\n\r\n“The ant,” says Dr. Weber, “is versatile in the American tropics where\r\nthe humidity is high and the temperatures uniform. The most common\r\nsites are in clay soil on the forest floor. An empty snail shell, a\r\ncurled dead leaf or a rotted twig may suffice for a colony of these\r\nsmall ants or they may find requisite conditions among roots or in the\r\ndead wood high in the rain forest canopy.\r\n\r\n“During the rainy season in Panama City there was a nest on a concrete\r\ncylinder above ground which protected a gas meter. The cylinder was 17\r\ncentimeters high (about 6 inches), by 36 centimeters in diameter and\r\nwas covered loosely by a concrete cover. In the narrow space on the\r\nrim under the cover a colony had walled off an elliptical area 36 by\r\n17 millimeters (about 4 inches by 3/4 of an inch), in which the entire\r\nnest with a fungus garden was formed. During drier periods the ants\r\nwould move down into the soil.\r\n\r\n“The workers usually are slow-moving and become immobile at the\r\nslightest disturbance. Sometimes, however, they run as rapidly as the\r\naverage ant when disturbed and seek to escape rather than feign death.\r\nIn “feigning death” the ants quickly curl up their legs and fold their\r\nantennae close to the body so that they appear almost invisible bits of\r\ndirt when casually examined.\r\n\r\n“The ants spend much time in grooming the forelimbs, antennae and\r\nother parts of the body. Regardless of how dusty an ant may become\r\nmomentarily, it keeps its antenna immaculate by drawing it through its\r\nmouth and licking and cleansing it. They also clean one another. In\r\ngrooming each other the ants may carefully go over a large portion of\r\nthe body. In one instance a slightly callow worker was watched as it\r\ngroomed another of the same age. The one being groomed turned over on\r\nits side, like a dog or a monkey. The grooming of each other and the\r\ncleaning of the brood is a vital part of their activities as it removes\r\nalien bacteria and fungi and also may have a nutritive function so far\r\nas the brood is concerned.\r\n\r\n“The fungus garden consist of masses from a quarter millimeter to a\r\nhalf millimeter in diameter (from about 100th to a 60th of an inch.)”\r\n\r\nThey have their bitter, nearly microscopic enemies. Upon them, as upon\r\nelephants, ride much smaller, bareback riding mites whose acrobatic\r\nstunts would be the envy of any circus performer.\r\n\r\n“Seven out of 16 ants so examined,” Dr. Weber says, “had mites on them.\r\nThese mites have no difficulty in moving from one site to another on\r\nthe ants. A transfer of a mite from one ant to another was watched. It\r\nhad been riding on one ant when another brushed by waving its antennae\r\nover the other as is customary. In a flash the mite grabbed the tip of\r\nthe left antenna. The ant did not attempt to dislodge the mite although\r\nit already had two others on its body. The mite had a rough ride, but\r\nwas not dislodged.”\r\n\r\nThe peculiar type of fungus grown by the ant does not grow naturally\r\noutside the nest. It can be isolated and cultivated but it quickly is\r\noverwhelmed by other fungi in any artificial culture. It is probable\r\nthat ant and fungi need each other for survival. Possibly the saliva of\r\nthe insect is essential for the growth of the primitive plant. Likewise\r\nthe peculiarly developed fungus is essential for the well-being, even\r\nfor the survival, of the ants. It is one of nature’s partnerships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ostracoderms: Ancestors of True Fish_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe race of fish first appeared about 350,000,000 million years ago\r\nin the Silurian geological era. It was made up of grotesque, clumsy,\r\nheavily armored animals who crawled over the ooze of the sea bottoms\r\nwith very little, if any, capacity to rise or propel themselves in the\r\nwater. The ascent from such an unpropitious beginning to the swift,\r\ngraceful swimmers of today is one of the wonder stories of evolution.\r\n\r\nThese Silurian animals were the ostracoderms. They belonged to the\r\ngeneral fish complex but were not in the direct ancestral line of any\r\nextant fish. This race continued, in various groupings, for at least\r\n150,000,000 years. The earliest forms were wormlike animals whose\r\nfossils are found in ancient rocks of Esthonia. Their heads and the\r\nforward parts of their bodies were covered with bony plates. They had\r\nno fins to serve for steering and balancing. In appearance they were\r\nclose to tadpoles. It is quite obvious that they were bottom-dwelling\r\nforms who swam, if at all, awkwardly and laboriously. The evolution\r\ninto more and more efficient swimming animals can be traced through\r\nlater and later fossils throughout the life history of the race.\r\nThe body became more flexible. There was a gradual reduction in the\r\nthickness of the external armor as the ostracoderms came to depend more\r\nand more on speed and less on invulnerability. At the end they probably\r\nwere comparatively good swimmers.\r\n\r\nA little later than the earliest of this long extinct family came\r\nthe first representatives of the true fish—probably derived from the\r\nsame general ancestral stock. They also were bottom-dwelling animals,\r\nalthough from the beginning they appear to have been a little better\r\nadapted for swimming. In these also, the head and forward part of the\r\nbody were encased in heavy armor. In ostracoderms, however, this had\r\nformed a continuous shell, allowing no anterior freedom of motion in\r\nthe water. In the earliest true fish it was divided into two parts, the\r\nhead shield and the body shield. For the most part, however, they could\r\nuse only the tail and posterior part of the body for propulsion. But\r\nthrough many generations various diversifications of the race became\r\nmore and more fishlike in form, shed their heavy protective plates,\r\ndeveloped paired fins for steering and balance, and continuously\r\nimproved as swimmers.\r\n\r\n“We must take it for granted,” explains Prof. Anatol Heintz, Norwegian\r\npaleontologist, “that the ancestral forms of the vertebrates evolved\r\nin water. Most primitive forms lived on the bottom and had not yet\r\nspecialized sufficiently to be able to swim. If the oldest vertebrates\r\nwere bottom-living or burrowing forms they must have learned to swim,\r\njust as later they learned to crawl, walk, run and finally fly.”\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest groups of true fish were the coelacanths, or “hollow\r\nspines.” They left many fossil remains over a period of 200,000,000\r\nyears. Supposedly they became extinct about sixty million years ago, at\r\nthe start of the dawn age when most higher life types known at present\r\nfirst appeared. Through all the vast eons of their existence the\r\n“hollow spines” changed little.\r\n\r\nThree years ago came one of the outstanding events in present day\r\nbiology. A living coelacanth was caught by native fishermen off the\r\nnortheastern coast of Madagascar. It was quite similar to its fossil\r\nancestors—armored head and all. Apparently the Madagascan fishermen had\r\nbeen capturing similar creatures in their nets occasionally for years,\r\nwithout realizing that they were of any particular significance.\r\n\r\nTo biologists the news of this capture was as exciting as would have\r\nbeen that of finding a living dinosaur. The coelacanths, in fact were\r\nhoary with age when the earliest dinosaurs appeared on earth. This fish\r\nwas a survivor from days when animals first were developing spines and\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nThe specimen, however, was practically ruined before it came to the\r\nattention of the scientists. Native sailors had sliced it open from\r\nsnout to tail. All the brain and other soft parts of the head were\r\ngone. Other parts were so badly mangled that it was impossible to\r\nreconstruct them.\r\n\r\nSince then several others have been caught. An intriguing possibility\r\nis that of obtaining a female with unborn young. A developing embryo\r\nsupposedly recapitulates ancestral forms. If one could be found it\r\nwould be possible to reconstruct something of the real ancestry of the\r\nfirst back-boned animals.\r\n\r\nNatives report that the coelacanth is extremely oily. Its flesh drips\r\noil. When boiled it quickly turns to jelly. This fact may have a\r\nbearing on the origin of some of the earth’s great oil deposits. Man\r\ntoday may be running his automobiles or heating his homes on the fuel\r\nproduced by vast hordes of these head-armored, hollow-spined fish in\r\nthe ancient warm seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ever Faithful Hornbills_\r\n\r\n\r\nLady hornbills are trusting wives and gentlemen hornbills are\r\nunbelievably faithful husbands.\r\n\r\nThe hornbills are birds with enormous beaks. They have the size of\r\nsmall turkeys and are usually found in pairs in the forests of East\r\nAfrica. They are perhaps best known from the curious instinctive\r\nbehavior of the female. Before laying her annual quota of two eggs\r\nshe walls herself with mud, collected by the male, into a hole near\r\nthe top of some high jungle tree. There one of the eggs—apparently\r\nseldom both—is hatched and the chick reared. The female continues this\r\nvoluntary imprisonment for two months or more.\r\n\r\nThere is always a small aperture in the wall. Through this the foraging\r\nmale passes food to his imprisoned mate, once an hour or less. Food\r\nconsists mostly of fruits. Sometimes he brings her what apparently are\r\nplaythings to relieve the monotony of hatching and chick-rearing.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive report on the behavior of these grotesque birds in the\r\nMpanga Research Forest of Uganda, by Dr. Lawrence Kilham of Bethesda,\r\nMaryland, is a classic on bird-watching.\r\n\r\nHornbills mate for life and apparently their conjugal life is a\r\nmodel of high morality for the whole animal kingdom. Walled into the\r\ntree-holes, the females obviously are helpless to protect themselves\r\nagainst any infidelity, and, sad to say, there are vampire female\r\nhornbills in the jungle whose only thought is to steal some imprisoned\r\nlady’s spouse.\r\n\r\nIn the case observed by Dr. Kilham, however, the male preserved his\r\nvirtue to the end. “By November 8,” he records, “the female was walled\r\nin, and a more serious attempt at interference was now made by a\r\nforeign female.... She was following the male and lighted in the next\r\ntree when he lighted above his nest hole. On November 23 the same\r\ncourse of events took place, except that the male was less tolerant.\r\nHe fed his own mate, then drove the intruder away. A week later I saw\r\nher fly in close behind the male and light 25 feet from the nest hole.\r\nThe male gave his mate a piece of bark followed by some fruit, and then\r\nbounced from one branch to another toward the foreign female.”\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow was falling, falling, but “the female within the nest\r\nscreamed a number of times. I wondered whether the interloper could\r\nseduce the male, but from subsequent observations it seemed unlikely\r\nthat she would. The male returned again to the nest hole, and a few\r\nminutes later was in the upper part of the tree knocking about on dead\r\nbranches until he dislodged a piece of bark. He clamped his bill on\r\nthe bark until it was largely fragmented. Then he moved toward the\r\nforeign female. If he presented the bark [a cherished play object among\r\nhornbills] one would suppose that she had some attraction for him.\r\nAfter a moment, however, he changed his direction, flew down to the big\r\nlimb below, bent over the nest hole, and gave the token to his mate,\r\naccompanied by a feeding chuckle. Subsequently he returned to perch\r\nquietly within eight feet of the intruding female. At 7:30 a.m. the two\r\nof them flew away together. As the nesting season progressed, he became\r\nless tolerant of her intrusions...On February 3 I again watched her\r\nfly in behind the male and alight on the nest tree, making considerable\r\nnoise. The male stopped feeding his mate, swooped at the interloper\r\nand drove her down toward the ground. However, when he flew away, she\r\nfollowed a short distance behind.”\r\n\r\nThe vampire was hard to discourage. A few days later she was observed\r\nat the entrance to the nest, trying to break the wall with her beak.\r\nProbably there was a sex murder case in the making. But “After five\r\nminutes the male arrived and...drove the foreign female to another\r\ntree, flying at her so hard that he knocked leaves from intervening\r\nbranches. He returned to his nest with a small stick held like a cigar.\r\nHis mate, who had remained silent, now began her wailing screeches....\r\nThe intruding female, persistent as usual...had followed the male\r\nback to the nest tree. In a few minutes he flew at her again, flying\r\nfaster than hornbills usually do as he chased her from one tree to\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\nBut his ordeal of bachelorhood was nearly over. Five days later mother\r\nand young emerged from the nest: “The pair of hornbills were perched\r\nside by side on their tree. Not long after I heard a great flutter of\r\nwings. I looked back to see both members of the pair pursuing a foreign\r\nfemale.... When the parents later came to our garden, she did not\r\nfollow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ants With Tailor Skills_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnts developed the craft of sewing long before humans. There are\r\nspecies of tailor ants in Australia, Africa and India that have\r\ndistinctly ingenious habits. They make nests of leaves sewed together\r\nwith silken threads, secreted by their own larvae, which they use both\r\nas needles and shuttles.\r\n\r\nWhen the nest is torn in any way certain soldiers and workers,\r\napparently specialized for this particular job, rush to the scene. The\r\nsoldiers arrange themselves to protect the workers. These first try to\r\npull the two edges of the rent together. If the gap is too wide for a\r\nsingle insect to reach the other side and secure it with her mandibles\r\na living chain is formed, sometimes as much as six ants long. One holds\r\nanother in front of her with her mandibles, the second similarly holds\r\na third, and so on until the other side is reached. Hours sometimes are\r\nrequired before the edges of the tear can be brought together and held\r\nin contact.\r\n\r\nThen several other workers appear, each carrying a larva head upwards.\r\nThese little worms are carried back and forth like a shuttle, spinning\r\nthe threads which are pushed through needle holes made by the workers\r\nuntil the rent is securely patched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fiend Symphonies of the Jungle_\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of green jungle depths at sunrise rises the choral hymn of the\r\ndamned. It is a symphony of earth’s evil, of ancient dinosaurs and\r\nflying reptiles, of vampires and witches. It comes from the throats of\r\njet-black, long-bearded, fiend-like creatures wearing red shawls. They\r\nare the howler monkeys.\r\n\r\nThe world’s loudest-mouthed bluffers and braggarts are these dwellers\r\nin the high treetops. They swear in an ancient tongue evolved over\r\ncenturies for the effective cursing of hovering white hawks, black\r\nvultures and lurking wild cats. Now they curse, loudly and most\r\nprofanely, airplanes which sweep low over Panama and Costa Rican\r\njungles. They have not found it necessary to invent any new expressions\r\nto convey their contempt for the new monsters of the skies.\r\n\r\nTheir voices are their only weapons. These have proved quite effective\r\nthroughout the lifetime of the race. The howlers have been able to\r\nthreaten their enemies with perdition so convincingly that these\r\nenemies have believed the threats. Largely as a result, the big black\r\nmonkeys have been left alone as the dominant animals of the weird,\r\nperilous green world at the top of the jungle. They never have had to\r\nfight with fists, claws or teeth. All they have done—all it has been\r\nnecessary to do—is talk about it.\r\n\r\nThe scream of the howler, hurled defiantly at a possible enemy or\r\nraised in a diapason to the sunrise or in a ritual of worship to the\r\nfull moon, is the most fearsome sound of the jungle. As one zoologist\r\nhas said: “It’s a combination of the bark of a dog and the bray of\r\na mule magnified a thousand-fold.” It can be heard, and clearly\r\ndiscriminated, eight or ten miles away. Some say that the howl not only\r\nsounds like the voices of fiends let loose from the pits of Hades, but\r\nthat the appearance of the animals themselves is just about what one\r\nwould picture for the infernal beings. The loudness and carrying power\r\nis due to the monkey’s peculiar throat structure, which enables the\r\nsound to reverberate. This throat structure is the weapon which nature\r\nhas provided for the animal and it has enabled him to more than hold\r\nhis own in the endless struggle for survival of the fittest. Even more,\r\nit has made him supremely contemptuous of all lesser-voiced creatures,\r\nsuch as men on foot or men in airplanes at whom he howls defiantly.\r\n\r\nOf all apes or monkeys, the howler probably looks the least like his\r\ndistant cousin, man. He is at very best a grotesque caricature of a\r\nchimpanzee or a gorilla. Attempts have been made to oust him from the\r\nmonkey race altogether and to degrade him to the pseudo-monkeys, the\r\nlemurs. But in biology there is nothing to justify this.\r\n\r\nFortunately for students of animal behavior the howler is a daylight\r\nanimal. He usually goes to bed at sundown and stays there until\r\nsunrise, except on occasions when the full moon awakens him and arouses\r\nsome uncontrollable frenzy which finds expression in the weird howling.\r\nSo about everything he does is open to observation.\r\n\r\nThe creatures remain about the least acceptable of the monkey and ape\r\nrace in human company. The feeling apparently is reciprocal. The howler\r\nis an almost untamable wild animal. He never will dance at the end of a\r\nhurdy-gurdy grinder’s leash, and seldom will be on exhibit in zoos. He\r\ndies quickly in captivity, but only after becoming such a nuisance with\r\nthe howling of a broken heart that zoo keepers are glad to be rid of\r\nhim. Only one specimen has been kept in captivity at Barro, Colorado—a\r\nbaby rescued by one of the Indian guides after she had fallen out of\r\na tree. This happens not infrequently to the little howlers before\r\nthey have mastered the acrobatics of the forest canopy. They are not\r\nclimbers at birth, any more than seals are able to swim.\r\n\r\nIn the strange treetop realm among his own the howler is a much more\r\nengaging personality than he appears down below. He is the “man” of the\r\ngreen canopy 100 feet above the earth. He is the dominant creature,\r\nintellectually if not always physically, and he appears to have evolved\r\na complex form of social organization.\r\n\r\nFrom two to three hundred of the big black monkeys inhabit Barro,\r\nColorado. They are split into groups of from ten to twenty individuals.\r\nThese groups are probably extended families, each consisting of two or\r\nthree adult males, a few younger males, and the remainder females and\r\nbabies. Each clan possesses an area of from 250 to 500 acres. This is\r\nthe “home town” and few of the monkeys ever stray across its borders.\r\n\r\nWithin such an area are “roads,” path of long branches and heavy vines\r\nby which a troop can pass easily from one treetop to another. These\r\nsame ways are maintained year after year. The howler requires solid\r\nfooting. Despite his lofty, wind-tossed habitat he is not much of a\r\ngymnast. For one reason, his body is too heavy. He appears quite clumsy\r\ncompared with his lighter, more volatile relatives, the spider monkeys\r\nof the same high realm. Howlers, for example, very seldom have been\r\nobserved leaping from tree to tree. Occasionally, probably only in\r\ncases of dire necessity, a swinging vine may be used as a trapeze. Any\r\naerial acrobatics, however, appear far from this monkey’s ideas of good\r\nsport.\r\n\r\nThrough its allotted area a group usually moves in single file, the\r\nadult males leading the way and the females with young clinging to\r\ntheir backs or breasts bringing up the rear. The treetop roads seldom\r\nare wide enough to permit two monkeys to move abreast. When any of the\r\ntroop drops behind, the procession is held up to wait for him. If he\r\ndoes not appear in a few minutes scouts are sent back to find out what\r\nhas happened. About the worst to be anticipated is that a mother has\r\ndropped her baby. She immediately will descend to retrieve it from the\r\nground or, as is more likely, from some of the lower branches which\r\nhave broken its fall.\r\n\r\nThe animals appear to maintain a communistic family life. A family\r\nnever seems to increase or decrease in numbers. Probably new groups\r\nare formed if the birth rate becomes greater than is necessary for\r\nreplacements. In the absence of epidemics death rates are not heavy,\r\nfor the animal has no very formidable natural enemies. Its hellish howl\r\nis enough to scare away even the strongest, fiercest invaders of its\r\nhigh country.\r\n\r\nClasses are mutually exclusive. But there are no wars in the treetops.\r\nWhen one group ventures near the border of a range claimed by another\r\nall the inhabitants get together and set up the most fiendish howling\r\nof which they are capable. The potential invaders stop and howl back,\r\njust as fiendishly. After a more or less prolonged session of this\r\nbloodless warfare both factions call it a day and go their peaceful\r\nways. Any actual fight between howler gangs has not been reported by\r\nreliable witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tyrants of the Polychaete Race_\r\n\r\n\r\nKnight-warriors and Amazons of the worm world are the aphroditids. They\r\nare the aristocrats and tyrants of the polychaete race.\r\n\r\nLike the oriental Aphrodite whose name they bear—she was the mythical\r\ngoddess of love and war who rose from the sea foam armed with golden\r\nspears which were the rays of the moon and sun she personified—they\r\ncrawl over the beach sands resplendent in a bristling panoply of gold\r\nand green. Heavily armed for both offense and defense, their prey are\r\nall living things remotely their equals in size and strength.\r\n\r\nFor their battles they carry on their feet “an armory of harpoons,\r\nbayonets, lances, spears and billing hooks,” says the Rev. George\r\nJohnston in his catalogue of annelid worms in the British Museum.\r\n“Were it desirable to have any additions to man’s weapons of war,” he\r\ncomments, “the aphrodite bayonet might furnish a model for a new kind\r\nas formidable as any we possess. It is armed with a kind of pricker\r\naffixed to the end of a musket. This appendage is very sharp, formed\r\nwith several cutting surfaces, and with a spine below pointed backwards\r\nwhich gives it the properties and advantage of a harpoon. Hence, having\r\nbeen forced to penetrate the flesh, the point cannot be withdrawn, but\r\nis detached at once.\r\n\r\n“This, however, is not the most curious part of the instrument. The\r\nbayonet part of the bristle is, in fact, a sheath which encloses\r\nanother weapon that is exposed only when the scabbard is lost. When we\r\ndetach the bayonet from the sheath, at the same time we force from its\r\ninterior a horny stylette with a needle-like point ready to become a\r\ngood defensive weapon.”\r\n\r\nThe terror of tidal beaches described by Dr. Johnston is the “sea\r\nmouse,” Aphrodite aculeata, an oval-shaped worm from six to eight\r\ninches long and two or three wide. It has from 30 to 50 large “feet”\r\non each side of its body, each carrying an immense tuft of silky green\r\nand golden bristles and spines. Many have commented on the malevolent\r\ncreature’s beauty and capacity for inspiring terror.\r\n\r\n“The very brilliant iridescent hues,” Dr. Johnston says, “are not\r\nequalled by the colors of the most brilliant butterflies.” “It does not\r\nyield in brilliance to the plumage of humming birds or even to the most\r\nshining gems,” wrote the great French naturalist Baron Cuvier, credited\r\nwith the original description of the animal.\r\n\r\nNormally it moves by jet propulsion. As it goes forward, a current of\r\nwater is projected with considerable force at short intervals from its\r\nrear end. Progress ordinarily is slow, but the sea mouse is capable of\r\nconsiderable speed when pursuing a slow-moving prey. It frequently can\r\nbe observed motionless, watching a weaker worm or mollusk upon which it\r\nis prepared quickly to pounce at a favorable opportunity.\r\n\r\nSome of these animals, Dr. Johnston observes, “have 500 feet on each\r\nside of the body. Each foot has two branches and each branch at least\r\none spine and one brush of bristles. Thus an individual has at least\r\n1,000 spines. If we reckon ten bristles to each brush, it has at least\r\n10,000.”\r\n\r\nThe bristles, presumably, are almost entirely for defense; the spines\r\nfor offense, and admirably fashioned for killing weaker animals. Both\r\ntypes of weapons can be retracted entirely inside the foot when not in\r\nuse, but thrust out again immediately when needed.\r\n\r\nAphrodite hermione, a close relative of the sea mouse, Dr. Johnston\r\npoints out, “has in the dorsal branch of its feet bristles which may\r\nbe described as lances. They are so small that a magnifying glass is\r\nneeded to discover the workmanship, which excels in finish the finest\r\ninstrument of man by the skill of the most expert artificer. A great\r\nnumber of these bristles garnish the extremity of each foot, and as\r\nthey are stiff and serially arranged they form a hedge of spears around\r\nthe body of the worm, placing it within a square of pointed pikes\r\nthreatening at all points. Other bristles terminate in a knob within\r\nwhich is a barbed lance.”\r\n\r\nStill others are likened by Dr. Johnston to harpoons, produced from\r\nthe body only as required. They are very sharply pointed bristles with\r\nthe point attached to a shaft. The harpoon point, like the bayonet\r\npreviously described, has a reverted tooth which cannot be withdrawn\r\nonce it has been plunged into the body of the enemy. It can, however,\r\nbe detached and left to fester in the wound. Some worms lose all their\r\nharpoons in their many fights.\r\n\r\n“There is scarcely a single weapon invented by the murderous genius\r\nof man,” commented the French naturalist Quatrefages concerning\r\naphroditids on Bay of Biscay coasts, “whose counterpart and model\r\ncould not be found among these worms. Here are the curved blades whose\r\npoints present a double and prolonged cutting surface, sometimes on the\r\nconcave edge as in the yataghan of the Arabs, sometimes on the convex\r\nborder as in the oriental scimitar. We meet with weapons of offense\r\nand defense which remind us of the broad sword of our cuirassiers;\r\nthe sabre-poignard of the artilleryman; the sabre-baionette of the\r\nchausseurs. We have harpoons, fishhooks, cutting blades in every form\r\nattached to the extremities of sharp handles. Destined to live by\r\nrapine and exposed to a hundred enemies, they need such weapons both\r\nfor attacking and defense.”\r\n\r\nSome aphroditids swim with ease. The majority, however, are found\r\nbetween tide marks where they burrow in wet sand. A few occasionally\r\ntrespass in tidal rivers. When placed in fresh water the animals soon\r\ndie, in their death throes first ejecting a milky-white fluid which\r\nturns to blackish-green at the moment of death. Despite their heavy\r\narmament, the aphroditids are a favorite food of codfish. They are\r\ndistributed generally all over the world. The monster of the race in\r\nthe South Pacific sometimes reaches a length of five feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eating Habits of Spiders_\r\n\r\n\r\nSpiders digest most of their food before eating. They must subsist on a\r\nliquid diet. A powerful digestive fluid from the stomach is discharged\r\non the prey. This completely liquifies the soft tissues. So potent is\r\nthis fluid that spiders sometimes can devour small back-boned animals,\r\nsuch as fish and lizards, which they kill with their poison fangs. One\r\nAfrican species can liquify almost completely a fish two inches long\r\nin less than three hours. Another has been observed in captivity to\r\ndispose of small snakes in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Suicide Instinct of Iguanas_\r\n\r\n\r\nSome iguanas seem to have the ability to commit suicide without any\r\nvisible means. Some of these lizards, hitherto unknown to science,\r\ncaptured alive and uninjured in Cuba by Dr. Paul Bartsch of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, died a few minutes later as if a mere wish to\r\nend their lives were sufficient to achieve death.\r\n\r\n“These iguanas are vegetable feeders,” Dr. Bartsch recorded in his\r\nfield notes. “They are fairly tame and persisted in chasing the nooses\r\non the ends of our sticks, instead of running their heads through them\r\nor letting us place them around their necks. When hard-pressed they\r\nfinally dash into holes that look like huge crab burrows. When near the\r\ncoast, where there is a hurricane rampart, they seek refuge in crevices\r\nof the rocks. We were surprised when we took those we had captured from\r\nour bag on board ship to find four of them dead. Evidently they have a\r\nway of ending their own lives.”\r\n\r\nOn Petite Gonave Island off the coast of Haiti are large iguanas\r\nwhich—native fishermen say—can be captured safely only by getting them\r\ndrunk. Travellers are warned that they are extremely dangerous animals\r\nwhen sober. The fishermen pour rum into hollows of rocks along the\r\nshore. The big lizards appear to be very fond of this beverage and\r\ndrink themselves helpless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forests That Eat Meat_\r\n\r\n\r\nRelic groves of the great meat-eating forests of 150,000,000 years ago\r\nstill thrive on the floors of deep, warm seas.\r\n\r\nThese are made up of plant-animals—predacious trees with red blood\r\nand hearts—the crinoids. There are about 700 extant, compared to more\r\nthan a thousand extinct, species. For a hundred million years they\r\nwere among the ocean’s dominant life forms. Fossil crinoids, or “stone\r\nlilies,” make up great marble beds in both American and Europe. In 1934\r\nthe Smithsonian Johnson expedition dredged nineteen species, including\r\ntwo not hitherto known to science, from the bottom of the great Porto\r\nRico Deep.\r\n\r\nThe crinoids are highly developed animals, although they look like\r\nplants. They can by no means be considered as a form of life on the\r\ndividing line of the animal and vegetable worlds. Rather they are\r\nanimals which have taken on the superficial appearance of plants. They\r\nare very highly specialized animals—so much so that there are few\r\nplaces in the world where they can survive in great numbers.\r\n\r\nIn life they usually are brilliantly colored. Judging from those that\r\nare found on the sea bottoms today one of the ancient meat-eating\r\nforests must have presented a very colorful spectacle of red, green,\r\npurple and yellow “blossoms.”\r\n\r\nMost of them live in deep water. There are free-moving varieties as\r\nwell as those that are fixed to the bottom with stems like plants.\r\nUntil recent years few were recovered in good condition because of the\r\ntendency of one of these plant-animals to break itself to pieces when\r\nagitated. When brought up from the bottom to the deck of a ship the\r\ncrinoid would proceed to break off the featherlike arms which make up\r\nthe blossoms. This was its natural defense reaction in the depths. Its\r\nway of escape when one of its arms was seized by a fish was to break\r\nit off. Then it could grow another quite easily. As a matter of fact,\r\nthis is the way the crinoid grows—one of the most wasteful processes of\r\ngrowth in nature. It breaks off one arm and grows two instead; but it\r\ncannot increase the number of its arms without discarding an old one.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty is that the gorgeous colors of the meat-eating\r\nflowers are fast only in salt water. They fade rapidly in air, fresh\r\nwater or alcohol so that there can be only a fleeting impression of the\r\ntrue coloration.\r\n\r\nThese crinoids live, for the most part, on diatoms, small crustaceans,\r\nand other tiny sea creatures which they first paralyze with poison from\r\nthe tentacles which line the grooves of the arms through which food is\r\ncarried to the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cave-Dwelling Birds_\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue creature of night is the guacharo, or “oil bird”, of northern\r\nSouth America. It is reddish-brown, about the size of a barnyard hen.\r\nExcessive layers of fat built up about its abdomen formerly were valued\r\nhighly by natives for eating purposes, resulting in the slaughter of\r\ncountless thousands every year. The guacharo spends its days a half\r\nmile or more deep in the interior of mountain caves. Here it roosts\r\nand builds its nests in crevices high in the rock walls. It leaves in\r\ngroups of twenty to thirty shortly after dusk and apparently spends the\r\nwhole night foraging for food, sometimes covering as much as 200 miles.\r\n\r\nLike the cave bat, it seems to have no difficulty finding its way\r\nin absolute darkness. An explanation of this ability, acoustic\r\norientation, has been reported by Dr. Donald R. Griffin of Cornell\r\nUniversity. The birds apparently are guided by echos of specific sharp\r\n“clicking” sounds which they make.\r\n\r\n“The individual click,” Dr. Griffin explains, “consists of a very few\r\nsound waves having a frequency of about 7,000 cycles per second. The\r\nduration of each click is about a millisecond (1,000th of a second).\r\nThe clicks were loud enough to be audible easily about 200 yards\r\ninside the cave. Except for their lower frequency, these sounds are\r\nvery similar to those used by insectivorous bats for their acoustic\r\norientation.\r\n\r\n“The external ear canals of three captive birds were plugged with\r\ncotton. They then became disoriented when flying in the dark. They\r\ncollided with every object they encountered. Before and immediately\r\nafter this treatment they flew about in a small dark room avoiding all\r\ncollisions with the walls.”\r\n\r\nTheir best known habitat is the guacharo cave in Venezuela’s Humboldt\r\nNational Park, where they are rigidly protected. Most of them nest\r\nin a vast subterranean hall more than a half mile long and a hundred\r\nfeet high. Here more than a thousand of the birds greet the intruder\r\ninstantly with a wave of awesome and deafening shrieks.\r\n\r\n“With the advent of dusk,” reports Dr. Eugenio de Bellard\r\nPietri—Venezuelan cave explorer, “the birds come out in compact groups\r\nbut before the exodus a preliminary flight is held by a few as if\r\nto make sure that night is falling. Soon they return to the depths\r\nof their somber mansion, evidently to give the flock the all clear\r\nsignal. Late in the evening there is not a single adult specimen left\r\nin the cave. The flight of these birds is silent and cannot easily be\r\ndetected.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Where Snails Become Flowers_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lowly snail reaches an apotheosis—rivalling flowers and butterflies\r\nas an expression of nature’s artistry—in Cuban forests. Delicate\r\nsunrise tints of pink, blue, violet, green and yellow make the shells\r\nof two or three genera of tree-dwelling mollusks like rare jewels. Most\r\nconspicuous are snails of the genus Polymita, confined to the Oriente\r\nprovince. Here they cover some trees so completely that the effect is\r\nlike that of a tree of flowers. Only upon close observation can one\r\ndetect that the blossoms are shells.\r\n\r\nThe animals live for the most part on a fungus that grows on the\r\nbark. The colors of the shells are affected by various chemical\r\nconstituents of the bark, notably tannic acid, and serve as warning\r\nto other creatures. In taste the snails are very bitter and no bird\r\nwill intentionally attack them. The color serves notice that only a\r\ndisgusting mouthful is to be had.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most beautiful of these shell forms were recently discovered\r\nby Dr. Paul Bartsch, former Smithsonian curator of mollusks. Fragile,\r\ntranslucent, colored as delicately as the loveliest of orchids,\r\nthese particular snails are the fairies of the mollusk world in the\r\nunconscious artistry with which they have constructed their moving\r\npalaces. One, a hitherto unknown species, has a remarkable combination\r\nof pale orange, orange buff, deeper orange and flame color—all shading\r\ndelicately into each other. The color effect is such as one might find\r\nrarely in rose petals. Another has a blending of ivory, olive green,\r\nlemon yellow and orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Termites That Eat Lead_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Barro Colorado island in the Panama Canal Zone the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution maintains an “experimental cemetery.” It consists of rows\r\nof upright posts which look like gravestones, half buried in the soil.\r\nThe purpose is to test the propensities of the island’s 42 species of\r\ntermites—just about man’s most persistent and expensive enemy in the\r\ntropics—to eat different kinds of wood impregnated with different kinds\r\nof repellants and poisons. To date approximately 35,000 tests have\r\nbeen made. The longer the work is continued the more Dr. James Zetek,\r\nformer director of the station, is impressed with the contrariness and\r\ningenuity of the blind, ant-like insects which achieve sub-human acmes\r\nof engineering ability, and whose appetites are marvelous.\r\n\r\nAmong Barro Colorado’s termites are some extraordinary bugs indeed.\r\nOne, for example, eats lead. It gnaws its way through the lead\r\nsheathings on cables. This is not because it likes a lead diet. Lead,\r\nin fact, is indigestible and the insects starve to death. But their\r\nappetites are so insatiable that the little creatures just keep on\r\ngnawing, in the hope that there will be wood on the other side.\r\n\r\nThis particular insect is known by the scientific name of coptotermes\r\nniger. It has been known to eat through a concrete floor nearly five\r\ninches thick—again not because of any particular liking for concrete\r\nbut because of the expectation of coming eventually to digestible\r\nwood. The feat was made possible because the sand used in making the\r\nconcrete contained many fragments of sea shells which were dissolved by\r\na powerful chemical excreted by the insects.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to dispose of termites by poison—that is,\r\npermanently. Races have risen here, for example, which seem to thrive\r\non arsenic. The insect lives on the cellulose in wood. This must be\r\ndigested by certain intestinal bacteria in the digestive tract. If\r\nthese microörganisms can be poisoned the termite starves. At first at\r\nleast 99 percent of the bacteria succumb to heavy doses of arsenic.\r\nThis means that 99 percent of the termites are killed. But always there\r\nare a few exceptionally tough bacteria with a high resistance to the\r\npoison. Their descendants in a few generations apparently become almost\r\nentirely resistant. With their help a new race of termites comes into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily termites attack only dead or dying wood. Some of them,\r\nhowever, carry fungi around with them to kill their own wood. The\r\nCanal Zone insects can dispose of living trees. Dr. Zetek tells of one\r\nattempt to establish an avocado plantation. He warned against it. When\r\nthe trees had reached the fruit-bearing stage and seemed healthy he\r\nwas ridiculed for his warnings. Branches were heavy with avocados and\r\nthere was promise of a record crop. He shook his head when shown the\r\nflourishing orchard. “The poor trees,” he remarked. “They know they are\r\ngoing to die. They are just making one last mighty effort to preserve\r\ntheir species by producing plenty of fruit and seeds.” He secured the\r\norchard owner’s permission to chop down one tree. The whole inside, he\r\nfound, was riddled with termite galleries. This tree and all the others\r\nin the orchard were dead within a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Plant That Eats Animals_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are life-and-death battles in the microscopic world between\r\ntiny shelled animals and flesh-devouring fungi. The phenomenon can be\r\ncompared to that of a tree catching and eating big turtles.\r\n\r\nWhen a culture of diseased plant roots is made, there soon appear great\r\nnumbers of microscopic plants and animals—bacteria, fungi, amoebae,\r\nnematodes and other life forms. Immediately the struggle for survival\r\nstarts. The animals try to eat the plants and the plants attempt to\r\ndevour the animals.\r\n\r\nAmong the animal forms which appear are vast numbers of creatures\r\nknown as rhizopods. Practically unknown except to specialists, these\r\nmicroscopic creatures play an important part in the economy of life.\r\nThey are probably the best-equipped of all the new arrivals to survive,\r\nsince their soft bodies are covered with relatively heavy shells.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Dr. Charles Dreschler of the U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture reported the existence of predaceous meat-eating\r\nfungi—parasitic forms of plant life—which literally lassoed such\r\nunprotected animals as amoebae and thread-like nematodes and proceeded\r\nto devour them at leisure by the process of infiltrating their bodies.\r\nIt would appear that the armored rhizopods are completely protected\r\nfrom these ferocious plants.\r\n\r\nBut the animal has one weak spot in its defense. It must get its mouth\r\noutside its shell in order to eat. Apparently the most inviting forage\r\nat hand is the innocent-appearing fungus. The rhizopod proceeds to\r\nsuck at it with movements which Dr. Dreschler describes as similar to\r\n“sucking an egg.”\r\n\r\nThe rhizopod mouth is small. Once it has sucked in any of the\r\nfungus its fate is sealed, for, explains Dr. Dreschler, “to such\r\nundiscriminating voracity the fungus responds by rapidly proliferating\r\nfrom the partly ingested portion a bulbous outgrowth slightly larger\r\nthan the mouth, so that the rhizopod is held securely.”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate shelled animal is like a fish caught on a hook. It\r\nstruggles vainly to get away. It rushes, but the fungus simply lets\r\nout the line until the rhizopod is brought to an abrupt stop and can\r\nbe hauled in. The line is a filament connecting the body of the fungus\r\nwith the bulb in the animal’s mouth.\r\n\r\nOnce its prey is secure, the fungus proceeds to send out growths from\r\nthe bulb through the creature’s flesh, literally eating it alive. Very\r\nrarely, like a hooked fish, a rhizopod is able to break away.\r\n\r\nIn the course of its life, a single one of these thread-like fungi\r\nwill capture many of the shelled animals, lining them up securely\r\nmouth-to-mouth on both sides of itself. It absorbs their substance at\r\nits leisure. Other predaceous fungi have definite external organs for\r\ncapturing their prey. This particular species, however, has no external\r\nappendages and appears completely inert and innocent until it is\r\nstimulated to action by the sucking of the rhizopod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ocean’s Sound Barrier_\r\n\r\n\r\nA densely woven carpet of life covers the floor of the world of light\r\nunder the sea—just below the level reached by the most penetrating rays\r\nof the sun. It is a carpet of many colors and of flashing lights, the\r\nstrands of its texture rapidly moving, predaceous, warring organisms.\r\nThey probably are a mixture of lantern-carrying fish, ten-tentacled\r\nsquid with malevolent red eyes, and small, luminous, shrimp-like\r\ncreatures known as euphasids. Their nature can only be deduced by the\r\nechoes of sound from their bodies.\r\n\r\nThis carpet, about 300 feet thick, is the sea’s “false bottom.” It was\r\ndiscovered by Navy ships making depth soundings during the war. Such\r\nsoundings depend on the time taken for echoes to be reflected to the\r\nsurface from the ocean floor. Recorded on a ship’s instruments, they\r\nrepresent an extremely precise procedure perfected to the point where\r\na continuous record of depth can be obtained with an accuracy of a few\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nBut, using certain wavelengths of sound, echoes were received from\r\ndepths between 1,000 and 1,500 feet, whereas the sea itself was known\r\nto be two or three miles deep at these places. The only plausible\r\nexplanation was that there were vast multitudes of floating or swimming\r\nobjects of some sort, constituting almost a solid surface, at the\r\ndepths from which the echoes came. The mystery was increased by the\r\nfact that the false bottom existed only during daylight. The carpet was\r\nlaid shortly after sunrise and rolled up at twilight. The indication\r\nwas that the echo-producing objects rose to the surface at the\r\nbeginning of darkness—a clue which has given rise to much speculation\r\nand argument.\r\n\r\nThe carpet is under all the oceans, even the nethermost Antarctic. In\r\nsome areas it seems practically continuous over thousands of square\r\nmiles. In others it is broken up into smaller areas, like scatter rugs\r\non a floor.\r\n\r\nThe false bottom is almost as much a mystery today as when it first\r\npuzzled the Navy’s navigators. All are agreed that it must be composed\r\nof vast hordes of animals. They are not directly observable by any\r\nknown technique. Some indication of their size and abundance, however,\r\ncan be deduced from the wave lengths of sound which they echo. There\r\nmust be, it has been calculated, from ten to twenty of these organisms\r\nin each cubic meter of water. They echo only long sound waves. High\r\nfrequency sound passes through them like light through glass and is\r\nbounced back from the true sea bottom. They have been a mild nuisance,\r\nbut never a peril, to modern navigators.\r\n\r\nWhatever the organisms may be, they evidently cannot endure any light.\r\nAt dawn they sink immediately from within about 100 feet of the surface\r\nthrough the zone of moonlight-pale, green illumination which represents\r\nsunshine’s deepest penetration of sea water.\r\n\r\nChief proponents of the theory that a preponderance of them are squid\r\nare oceanographers of the Navy’s Hydrographic Office. It is well\r\nestablished that the deep sea abounds in these fantastic mollusks.\r\nThey rarely are seen at the surface. They move through the water very\r\nrapidly by a kind of jet propulsion, gulping water in the mouth and\r\nshooting it out explosively from the rear. They are little affected by\r\nchanges in hydrostatic pressure, as are fish with air bladders. When\r\nthe false bottom rises at sunset it comes to the surface at a rate\r\nof forty to fifty feet a minute. No swimming fish, it is maintained,\r\ncould rise so rapidly through the decreasing pressure. It would get the\r\n“bends”, like a human diver brought to the surface in too great a hurry.\r\n\r\nThese squid range in length from three or four inches to more than a\r\nfoot. They are of about the right size to return some of the echoes\r\nwhich have been observed. The faintly luminous euphasid shrimps also\r\nare known to be very abundant in the depths. Presumably they provide\r\nmost of the squids' food.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigations have been carried out by the Navy’s\r\nElectronics Laboratory and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography of San\r\nDiego. An outstanding difficulty hitherto has been that the echoes have\r\nbeen known only from the false bottom as a whole. They have covered\r\na wide spectrum of sound wavelengths. A recently developed technique\r\nis to lower a hydrophone connected with a sound-producing mechanism\r\ninto the depths in order to record echoes from individual objects at\r\ndistances of a few feet. Indications to date are that some of them are\r\nfrom a foot to eighteen inches long—too large to be squid and far too\r\nlarge to be shrimp. They can only, it is deduced, be deep water fish.\r\nIf a great number of fairly large fish are indicated, this false\r\nbottom might turn out to be the richest pasture in the ocean for the\r\nproduction of food for man.\r\n\r\nNavy divers have swum through the false bottom at night when it was\r\nwithin less than 200 feet of the surface. They have observed enormous\r\nnumbers of euphasids and other small organisms—but very few fish. This,\r\nhowever, is only suggestive. There is no good reason to believe the\r\ncarpet has the same texture at night as by day. It is quite likely that\r\nthe organisms disperse widely over the surface waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Snakes That Act and Look Like Worms_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are snakes that look like snarls of six-inch-long pieces of\r\nwrapping twine. These worm snakes are the world’s closest imitators\r\nof worms. Among the most secretive of living things, they rarely come\r\nin contact with man. When they are seen they usually are mistaken for\r\nworms. Only zoologists can put them in their true families. These\r\nliving strings live exclusively under the earth, sometimes in tangled\r\nsnarls of scores of individuals.\r\n\r\nThey are the smallest of snakes. Their closest relatives, however, are\r\nthe gigantic boas and pythons. Judging from their wide distribution—on\r\nsuch isolated spots, for example, as Christmas Island in the Indian\r\nOcean—they are quite ancient reptiles whose wanderings started about\r\nfifty million years ago.\r\n\r\nThey are found most often in termite nests, where they eat the eggs\r\nand possibly the larvae. Small earthworms and other soil creatures add\r\nto their diet. The worm snakes are almost toothless. Eyes are buried\r\nunder skin, are only faint spots, and probably only can discriminate\r\nlight from darkness. The tail looks somewhat like the head—a likeness\r\npresumably developed as a camouflage. They retain a snake’s scales, but\r\nthese are highly polished so they can be of no help in crawling.\r\n\r\nThese Typhlopidae and Glauconidae, as the two major groups are known,\r\nare extremely active. When they are exhumed they start at once to\r\nburrow back and have been found as much as two feet underground.\r\nOccasionally they may be found in mole holes or in rotten wood where\r\nthey feed on insect larvae and also, it is likely, get some warmth\r\nfrom the decay process. The snout is used in burrowing. They are hard\r\nto hold in the hand, owing to the high polish of the scales. There are\r\napproximately 100 species scattered over the world, two coming as far\r\nnorth as the Texas border. They have teeth in only one jaw—the upper\r\njaw for Typhlopidae, the lower for Glauconidae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Porcupine of the Sea_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the weirdest creatures of the deep is also one of the latest to\r\nbecome known to science—the sea urchin (closely related to star fish)\r\nastropyga magnifica. It is the largest sea urchin yet found in the\r\nAtlantic. It has approximately 200 bright blue eyes arranged in double\r\nrows. The body is covered with several hundred sharp, barbed black\r\nspines nearly a foot long.\r\n\r\nThat so conspicuous an animal, living in such a densely populated\r\nregion—one of the most intensively studied in the world by\r\nbiologists—should have remained undiscovered so long probably is due to\r\ntwo reasons. First, if its habits are at all comparable to those of its\r\nnearest relatives, it is strictly nocturnal and comes out to forage on\r\nthe coral sands of the shallow sea bottom only after light has ceased\r\nto penetrate the water. During the day the creatures remain secluded,\r\noften congregated in great numbers, in holes and caves of the sea floor\r\nand under the coral.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is quite similar in appearance to another smaller member\r\nof the sea urchin race with spines as much as 18 inches long which\r\nis greatly dreaded and is even reputed to have caused the death\r\nof children who have fallen on it. Anybody coming upon a daytime\r\nbed-chamber of these fantastic creatures would be likely to leave them\r\nstrictly alone.\r\n\r\nThis particular sea urchin is especially interesting in the development\r\nof its eyes. These appear to be true sight organs. If a hand is placed\r\nin the water near one of the animals the long barbs immediately are\r\npointed in the direction of the intrusion, and as the hand moves the\r\nbarbs move. Such a creature is practically impregnable. It never,\r\nhowever, takes the offensive. It cannot “throw” its barbs, but they\r\nenter the flesh easily and cause painful local irritation. Some species\r\ninject a virulent poison which may even kill a human being. There is no\r\nevidence that this species is toxic.\r\n\r\nAstropyga magnifica, which has more the appearance of a porcupine than\r\nof any other land animal, is a scavenger of the sea bottom. It gathers\r\nand devours the accumulated debris that falls through the water. It\r\nnever kills its own food, so far as is known. It has five sharp teeth\r\nin its mouth, located on its under surface, with which it can chew away\r\nthe flesh of dead animals.\r\n\r\nThis sea porcupine has a peculiar system of locomotion in common with\r\nmost of its relatives. It has literally thousands of sucker-like feet,\r\nwhich are hollow and attached to tubes within its shell. It moves\r\nby forcing water through the tubes and into the particular “feet”\r\nwhich it wishes to use. When these are out of use they are contracted\r\nby withdrawing the water. Being a radially symmetrical animal, the\r\ncreature can move with equal ease in any direction. It has no\r\nhead—that is, the development of its nervous system and the direction\r\nof its locomotion are not fixed in a forward direction, as is the case\r\nwith vertebrates and insects.\r\n\r\nSome members of the sea urchin family have hoof-like formations on the\r\nends of some of their spines, with which they are enabled to walk over\r\nthe sea bottom without using the suction disks. About the only enemy\r\nof these fearsome nightmares of the deep is man. Some species are used\r\nextensively for human food, notably among the Mediterranean coast and\r\nin the West Indies. The developing eggs are taken from the body and\r\neaten either raw or cooked. Even if it should prove suitable for human\r\nfood, it is unlikely that the sea porcupine ever will be a rival in\r\nthis respect of its rival, the “sea rabbit.” It is too secluded in its\r\nhabitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms That Are Unkillable_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn nematodes life may have reached its greatest capacity for survival.\r\nThe remarkable persistence of these soil worms has been studied by C.\r\nW. McBeth, researcher of the Shell Oil Company. One form, he reports,\r\nhas been known to survive after 25 years in a glass bottle in a\r\nlaboratory. Another, a pest of wheat kernels, apparently came back to\r\nlife after 28 years in laboratory storage. A nematode which had invaded\r\na rye plant, collected in Kansas in 1906, revived after 39 years of\r\ncomplete dehydration in a herbarium.\r\n\r\nThose which live as active feeders in the soil, however, are not\r\nparticularly long-lived. Each species depends on a certain plant type\r\nand must starve if this is not available. The recently introduced\r\ngolden nematode of potatoes, a particularly obnoxious pest, is known,\r\nhowever, to survive as much as ten years in soils where no potatoes\r\nare planted. A great mass of eggs is produced, but not laid. They are\r\nretained in the body of the mother, who dies. Her skin remains—a bag\r\nfilled with eggs.\r\n\r\nThis stays in the soil, apparently unharmed by changing conditions,\r\nuntil potatoes are planted again. Then some mysterious influence, as\r\nyet unexplained, causes the eggs to hatch and the whole nematode cycle\r\nbegins once more.\r\n\r\nDue to such a strange tenacity of life this nematode is about the\r\nhardest of pests to control. It refuses to stay dead. Other species\r\nlikewise are specialized in one or more ways of survival under adverse\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nBecause of the complexity and minuteness of the nematodes, it has\r\nbeen very difficult to determine the effects of heat, cold, flooding\r\nand drying on different species. These vary for each. One nematode\r\nspecies, especially resistant to drying, has a skin consisting of nine\r\nlayers. The ability of this skin to hold moisture inside the minute\r\nbody undoubtedly is an important defense mechanism. Some species\r\nare entirely marine, others are parasites within the bodies of other\r\nanimals. It has been found that both of these varieties possess skins\r\nwhich are much more permeable to moisture. The original home of the\r\nphylum probably was in the sea, but a moisture-proof cuticle has been\r\ndeveloped by those which have invaded the land.\r\n\r\nThe whole body structure of the plant nematode is almost ideally suited\r\nto life in the soil. The typical eel-shaped body is well-adapted for\r\nmoving in the moisture surrounding soil particles. Deviations from this\r\neel-form in certain stages of some species, usually in mature females,\r\nare found only in sedentary stages. The larvae and males retain the\r\nancestral shapes. Another deviation is found in the so-called “ring\r\nnematodes” which have short, plump bodies incapable of locomotion in\r\nthe typical whip-like fashion. Movement is accomplished by alternate\r\nexpansion and contraction of the body.\r\n\r\nA majority of nematodes spend a greater part of their lives in the\r\nsoil. A few, however, are carried from plant to plant by insects.\r\nAlthough moisture is necessary if the tiny animals are to remain\r\nactive, the soil seldom becomes too dry for them except in the top two\r\nor three inches. Their structure is well-adapted for moving up and down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Remarkable Brachiopods_\r\n\r\n\r\nA part of the fantastic living world of 200,000,000 years ago has been\r\ndissolved out of about thirty tons of yellowish-brown limestone by a\r\nSmithsonian paleontologist.\r\n\r\nThe rock comes from a low mountain range in southwestern Texas—the\r\nGlass Mountains, about 250 miles east of El Paso. During the Permean\r\ngeological period, when some of the earliest known forms of animal\r\nlife appeared on land, the site of the Glass Mountains was a muddy\r\nbottom, probably close to the shore of a warm sea. A bewildering array\r\nof animals lived in that sea. They died and eventually were buried in\r\nthe mud. In some cases their bodies were covered with silica. In others\r\nsilica replaced the shells. When these rocks are placed in hydrochloric\r\nacid the limestone is eaten away but the silica shells remain. Years\r\nof skilled labor would be required to chip out of the rock what is\r\nobtained in a few days in the acid bath.\r\n\r\nMost abundant animals of the ancient Texas sea were the brachiopods\r\nor lampshells—essentially shelled worms. The broad road of life is\r\nstrewn with derelicts, stragglers and deserters. Among the most notable\r\namong them are these obscure creatures which, in numbers and apparent\r\nprosperity, seem to have been close to the dominant animals in the\r\nworld in the days when giant amphibians, remotely related to present\r\nfrogs and toads, and monster scorpions were establishing themselves on\r\ndry land.\r\n\r\nBrachiopods were among the first animals to leave any traces on earth a\r\nhalf billion years ago. Even at that time they were complex creatures,\r\nwith nerves and stomachs, which indicate a long ancestry before they\r\nleft any fossil remains. In the tepid Permian seas they reached their\r\nclimax in numbers and variety. They survive today, but only in a few\r\nplaces. For all practical purposes they are now among the most obscure\r\nanimals in existence. In the whole world there are about 110 extant\r\nspecies compared to nearly 500 which Dr. G. Arthur Cooper, Smithsonian\r\nInstitution curator of invertebrate paleontology, and his associates\r\nhave obtained from one small area of the Glass Mountain limestones.\r\n\r\nThe existing brachiopod might be mistaken for a small clam.\r\nZoologically, it is an intermediate form between mollusks and annelid\r\nworms, and somewhat closer to the latter than the former. Its way of\r\nlife actually is nearer to that of an oyster than to that of most\r\nworms. It now is believed to be most closely related, through some\r\nunknown common ancestor, to the bryozoa or lace weavers. In the past\r\nboth were classified together. The brachiopod never has become a\r\ncolonial animal.\r\n\r\nIts body is enclosed completely in a shell, secreted by the skin or\r\n“mantle”, except for a muscular, stalk-like extension, the peduncle, by\r\nwhich it attaches itself to the sea bottom. Inside the shell, folded\r\naround the mouth when the animal is at rest, are two arms or tentacles\r\nwith which it can probe the water and obtain minute food particles. It\r\nalso apparently breathes through these tentacles, which have a rapid\r\nblood circulation.\r\n\r\nMost numerous of the extant brachiopods is a curious animal, the\r\nlingula, which is nearly world-wide in distribution and whose peduncle\r\nis used for food in both Japan and the Philippine Islands. Along the\r\nAtlantic coast it is present from Chesapeake Bay to Florida. It makes\r\na nearly vertical burrow in mud or sand from two to twelve inches\r\ndeep—within which it lives, attached to the bottom by the peduncle.\r\nOn this footlike appendage it can lift itself until the front part of\r\nthe shell-enclosed portion of the body is above the surface. This is\r\nwithdrawn into the burrow instantly on the slightest alarm. The animal\r\napparently has a quite sensitive, although very primitive, nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe extant brachiopods are usually small animals but in their Permian\r\nheyday some attained a length of more than six inches. For essentially\r\n200,000,000 years they were without much competition in the mud burrows\r\nto which they had resorted. During this time arose clams, sea snails,\r\nand other mollusks which were free to move about and competed with them\r\nfor the available food supply. The brachiopod was unable to meet this\r\nvigorous competition and in a few million years the race was well on\r\nits way towards extinction. Most species disappeared. A few, including\r\nthe Lingula, survived into the age of the great dinosaurs, and their\r\ndescendants constitute the species living today. They are now obscure\r\ncreatures and a poverty-stricken group compared to their ancestors.\r\n\r\nIn the Permian seas they had surplus energy to expend not only in\r\nvariation of form and habit—but in shell artistry. Some of the\r\nspecimens obtained by the Smithsonian paleontologists are like\r\nglittering gems surrounded by silvery, hair-like spines.\r\n\r\nThese spiny brachiopods constitute about two-thirds of all the fossils\r\nobtained from the Glass Mountain rocks. Although the most abundant they\r\nwere far from the dominant animals of the Permian sea. They always were\r\ndefenseless little creatures, dependent on their hard, spiny shells\r\nfor protection. The sea monsters of the day, creatures related to the\r\npresent chambered nautilus and some of which were nearly two feet in\r\ndiameter, unquestionably were the lords of this marine creation. But\r\nthey were free-swimming predators who had little reason for concern\r\nwith the humble mud-dwellers. Next to the brachiopods in numbers and\r\nvariety, and probably their chief competitors, were the ancient lace\r\nweavers. Both shared forests of sponges which grew like small trees,\r\nup to heights of four feet and four to six inches across. Clams, some\r\nof which reached the size of giants, were beginning to claim dominion\r\nof the offshore mud and the brachiopods were near the end of their\r\nprosperous days.\r\n\r\nLike the sedentary worms, and most of the mollusks the brachiopod\r\nstarts life as a minute, free-swimming, wormlike larva, top-shaped\r\nand extremely active. During this period the mortality of the tiny\r\nunprotected creatures is very great, but once the mud-dwelling phase of\r\nexistence has started, the race is secure from most enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feathers on Birds Adapt to the Seasons_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a definite seasonal variation in the number of feathers on\r\nmost birds. It amounts to a “natural adjustment in dress to the needs\r\nof the season”. This fact has been determined through the laborious\r\nprocess of actually counting the feathers of birds of the same species\r\nat different seasons.\r\n\r\nThe number of feathers declines steadily from early spring until the\r\nend of summer when the so-called “post-nuptial” moult takes place,\r\nafter which the bird gets a new coat to last it a year. The bulk of\r\nthe new feathers are acquired at the same time, but some are added\r\nprogressively as the weather gets colder. An exception to this is\r\nfound, however, among those birds which migrate south early. These\r\napparently get a complete new outfit for their journey, since they will\r\nnot be obliged to experience any noteworthy change of climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why the Dodo Became Extinct_\r\n\r\n\r\nSmithsonian ornithologists have “rebuilt” a dodo. The dodo was a large,\r\npigeon-like, flightless bird which was abundant on Mauritius and\r\nneighboring islands in the Indian ocean during the seventeenth century.\r\nIt became a symbol—first of stupidity and later of extinction.\r\n\r\nIn its restricted environment it apparently had known no serious\r\nenemies prior to the coming of man. It had grown heavy, taken to a\r\nground existence, and lost the ability to fly. It showed no fear\r\nof man and, because of its clumsy movements, was easy to catch and\r\nslaughter, but its flesh was tough and tasteless, even for sailors who\r\nhad gone for months without fresh meat. Dutch navigators called it “the\r\nnauseating fowl”.\r\n\r\nDogs brought by the sailors killed great numbers of the stupid birds.\r\nThey might have survived despite their slowness and stupidity, however,\r\nhad it not been for the pigs and Ceylonese monkeys which came to\r\nMauritius with the first settlers. The rooting swine destroyed the\r\nbird’s eggs and the monkeys devoured its young. It was entirely extinct\r\nat the start of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shark of the Soil_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a protozoan, wormlike monster of the microscopic world, seen\r\nonly about forty times in two centuries, which gobbles up its fellow\r\none-celled creatures a hundred at a time, walks backwards and forwards\r\nat once, and hunts in packs.\r\n\r\nIt is fifty times the size of the most familiar of one-celled animals,\r\nthe paramecia, which constitute the dominant population (in numbers)\r\nof the invisible creation. It moves among the paramecia like a giant,\r\nflesh-eating dinosaur among humans. It is a cumbersome, slow-moving\r\nmass of protoplasm. Two or three get together and completely surround\r\na large school of paramecia and these are divided as meals for the\r\ncaptors.\r\n\r\nThe creature was first described by the Swedish botanist Linnaeus in\r\n1775. He called it _Chaos chaos_. It consists of a single cell, but\r\ndiffers from other one-celled animals in having three cell nuclei,\r\ninstead of a single one. To reproduce, it splits in three parts, each a\r\nnew animal.\r\n\r\n_Chaos chaos_ moves by stretching itself out into a ribbon-like form\r\nand proceeds, by a series of tugs of war, with one end or the other\r\nwinning out. The animal supposedly is very rare and has been seen only\r\nabout once every ten years. It may be a missing link between single-and\r\nmulti-celled animals—or it may be on an entirely different evolutionary\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sleeping Habits of Mammals_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tiny elephant shrew (its elongated nose gives it the appearance of\r\na miniature elephant) apparently never closes its eyes. It is a desert\r\nanimal, continually exposed to danger, and must “see” even when it is\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nSoundest sleepers are the burrowing animals, even when they take their\r\nnaps above ground. They are conditioned through innumerable generations\r\nof safe slumber in their subterranean chambers. Sleeping pocket mice\r\nand hamsters can be picked up without being awakened.\r\n\r\nSleep habits appear to be well adjusted to the needs of each species.\r\nMost bats, for example, sleep hanging head downward, suspended by the\r\nnails of the hind feet. This places them in a good position for sudden\r\nflight at any alarm. They have only to let go with their toes and\r\nspread their wings.\r\n\r\nCurious sleepers are the armadillos. They tremble almost continually in\r\ntheir sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Eerie Eyes of Animals at Night_\r\n\r\n\r\nEerie lights shine in the silent blackness of the jungle night. There\r\nare red lights and green lights, orange lights and yellow lights. They\r\nare reflections from the eyes of all sorts of animals.\r\n\r\nThis weird phenomenon has been observed closely for some years by\r\nErnest P. Walker of the National Zoo in Washington. The shining of eyes\r\nis a fairly well-known phenomenon but most of the observations have\r\nbeen made in the wild. The owner of the eyes is usually unknown, and\r\nit is virtually impossible to observe the animal again. Mr. Walker has\r\nconcentrated his observations on caged animals.\r\n\r\nHe uses a reflecting headlamp, similar to a hand flashlight, worn on\r\nthe forehead and connected with a three-cell battery in his pocket or\r\nattached to his belt. This is necessary because the rays of reflected\r\nlight must parallel closely the line of sight of the observer.\r\n\r\nThe “shines” range in color from pale silvery through silver,\r\nblue-green, pale gold, gold, reddish gold, brown, and amber to pink,\r\nwith a range of intensity from dull to very brilliant. The eyes of\r\nalligators and crocodiles “give one the impression that he is looking\r\ninto a brilliantly glowing pinkish opening in a dull-surfaced bed of\r\ncoal”. Most eye shines of mammals have the appearance of coming from\r\nhighly polished metal surfaces.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” explains Mr. Walker, “it is like looking into an\r\nincandescent globe of the color indicated. Often pronounced light\r\nrays seem to emanate from the eyes. With some eyes, such as those of\r\nthe smaller rodents, the effect is that of looking into an illuminated\r\npiece of amber.\r\n\r\n“In the case of animals that have eyes that glow, it appears that we\r\nlook into the eye through the pupil as if the reflection came from the\r\nfront surface of the retina. In those animals that give a reflection as\r\nif from polished metal I gain no impression of looking into the eye. In\r\nmost cases the reflection is not obtainable closer than from eight to\r\ntwenty feet—a distance which prevents one from observing which surface\r\nreflects. The reflection from alligators and crocodiles can be seen\r\nwhen the observer is within a foot of the animal.”\r\n\r\nMost animals stare at light, or barely move their heads. There seldom\r\nis any “startle” response when a beam is flashed upon them. There is no\r\nshine in the eyes of higher apes and monkeys. There have been reports\r\nof something of the sort from human eyes, but no definite proof has\r\nbeen offered. There was a faint suggestion of a reflection from the\r\nring-tailed lemur, a close relative of the monkey family. On the other\r\nhand, the most brilliant eye-shine of all was from two tiny members of\r\nthe lemur tribe, the slow loris and the potto.\r\n\r\nThe majority of rodent eyes shine dully in browns, hazel or amber.\r\nPorcupines are an exception. Their eyes are very brilliant, generally\r\nsilver and reflecting over a wide angle. Whether snakes have any true\r\neye reflection is questionable. Light is reflected, however, from the\r\nsurface of the scales over the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld of the Blind\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a fifth realm of life—the wet, heavy, black darkness of\r\nlimestone caves whose chambers, ponds and streams harbor almost a\r\nhundred species of worms, pseudo-worms, fish, insects and salamanders\r\nwhich have become adapted to life in this cheerless world over millions\r\nof generations.\r\n\r\nNearly all are white and blind. Blind white fish chase and eat blind\r\nwhite worms. Blind white spiders spin nets to trap blind, white flies.\r\nAll are sluggish creatures. Kentucky’s Mammoth Cave alone contains\r\napproximately 50 species. Latest to be classified scientifically are\r\nsmall, rather gruesome white worms of the sort one might imagine\r\nfeeding on the dead. They live in water, clinging to the bottoms of\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nMost spectacular of cave animals is the spectral Proteus, found in\r\nlimestone caves of Dalmatia, Carinthia and Carnolia in southeastern\r\nEurope. It is a kind of salamander, related to frogs and toads. It\r\nlooks and acts like a big white worm. The creature is about a foot\r\nlong and pure white except for its gills, which are vivid red. There\r\nare three pairs of these gills, which look like coarse feathers, just\r\nbehind the head.\r\n\r\nThe Proteus spends its whole life in total darkness, and at an almost\r\nconstant temperature of 50 F. The body is slender and decidedly\r\nwormlike, but there are two pairs of very feeble, inconspicuous little\r\nlegs, placed quite far apart.\r\n\r\nNature has made the Proteus a true creature of darkness—perhaps more\r\nso than any land-dwelling worm. As described by the late Dr. Austin H.\r\nClark, Smithsonian Institution biologist: “The Proteus is almost as\r\nsensitive to light as a photographic plate. The light of a candle at\r\nsome distance is strong enough to make it restless. If it is kept in a\r\nplace from which light is not entirely excluded its white skin turns\r\ncloudy with the appearance of gray patches, and if it is kept in an\r\nordinary lighted room it eventually turns jet-black.”\r\n\r\nProteus is eyeless. It seems feeble and helpless. Yet it is well\r\nadapted for its life in dark caves. Most of the time it lies at the\r\nbottoms of pools, completely motionless. But, says Dr. Clark, “any\r\nsmall living thing in the water attracts its immediate attention. It\r\nadvances toward it, snaps it up and eats it. It seems to be guided\r\nmostly by the movements of its victims in the water, possibly also by\r\na sense of smell. In the deep caves food naturally is scarce and the\r\nanimal often must go for a considerable time without anything to eat.\r\nIn captivity individuals have lived for months with no food at all.”\r\n\r\nGhostly dweller in the everlasting darkness of limestone caves in\r\nthe Ozarks is the Typhlotrition, a blind, wormlike white salamander\r\nof the same general family as Proteus. It is a long, slender, nearly\r\ntransparent creature, which has evolved a long way towards complete\r\nblindness. The newly hatched young have functioning eyes but these\r\ndegenerate in the adult so that it does not seem able to discriminate\r\nlight from darkness. It is barely able to stand on its thin, barely\r\nvisible legs. It lives on blind crustaceans and apparently spends most\r\nof its life crawling through the small, underground streams which seep\r\nthrough the limestone rocks of the Ozark foothills.\r\n\r\nA quite similar creature of the same family was discovered in 1896 in\r\nTexas during the boring of an artesian well. A subterranean stream\r\nwas struck at a depth of about 200 feet. From it this white, wormlike\r\ncreature was shot out, together with some remarkable crab-like\r\nanimals. A single specimen of a similar animal since has been found\r\nin Georgia. Both these organisms are more wormlike even than Proteus.\r\nThey apparently have lived for milleniums in streams flowing hundreds\r\nof feet below the earth. Both, it has been conjectured, are larval\r\nforms of a well-known salamander of surface waters, which have become\r\npermanent larvae. They have lost the ability to undergo metamorphosis,\r\nlike the change of a tadpole into a frog or a caterpillar into a\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nMost numerous of American limestone cavern animals are white, blind\r\ngrasshoppers—the cave crickets. They are small insects with antennae\r\nabout an inch long. With these they feel their way over the dank walls\r\nupon which they swarm. Best known are three species of cave fish,\r\nminnow-like and from two to three inches long. They have not lost their\r\neyes entirely, although these long since have been sightless. They\r\nhave compensated for the loss of sight by an extremely acute sense\r\nof touch. The slightest movement of the water will send a school of\r\nthem scurrying for shelter among the rocks. The blind white worms are\r\nsupposedly their chief food.\r\n\r\nNone of the cave animals are very aggressive. Their chief nutriment\r\nis believed to be organic matter carried by water, which seeps into\r\nthe dank chambers from the world above, but how they make use of this\r\nis unknown. All are quite primitive types which have remained very\r\nconservative after their first migration from the world of light into\r\nthe world of darkness. They are old both racially and in their behavior\r\nas individuals. Secure in the black depths, some of them are quite\r\nlikely to be the last living creatures on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Remarkable Clam Worms_\r\n\r\n\r\nFantastic giant of the nemertinean race is Cerebratulus lactus,\r\ncommonly known as “the clam worm” along the Atlantic Coast from Florida\r\nto Massachusetts. It is from ten to twelve feet long, can contract to\r\ntwo feet, and is an inch wide. Its favorite dwelling is a burrow six\r\nto eight inches below the surface, usually in an old mussel bed among\r\nbroken shells and stones where it is almost impossible to sink a clam\r\nhoe.\r\n\r\nOutside the burrows it is seldom seen except occasionally at high tide,\r\ngliding among sea weeds or in the shade of rocks in tidal pools. It is\r\nunlikely that any burrow is occupied very long, as the nemertinea is\r\nmoving about constantly through mud in search of food. The animal is\r\nhighly specialized for burrowing. Ordinarily its “head”, or front end,\r\nis broad and rounded. By a muscular contraction, however the shape of\r\nthe head can be made pointed and is thrust forward in the mud, when its\r\nnormal contour is resumed. Then again comes the muscular contraction,\r\nthe pointed head, and another thrust forward. This occurs over and over\r\nagain. The contraction waves follow each other so quickly that the\r\ndrilling process appears constant. The proboscis does not seem to be\r\nused in the actual drilling operation, but is kept probing for points\r\nof least resistance and turns aside at the slightest obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe favorite food of cerebratulus lactus is said to be another abundant\r\nburrowing worm, the nereid, which is nearly as large in diameter,\r\nbelongs to a higher order, and has powerful biting jaws. The victim\r\nalways is swallowed tail first. Its burrow is a U-shaped tube in which\r\nit is unable to turn around. The nemertean probes through the mud\r\nfor the tail end in such a burrow. The nereid, seized from behind,\r\ncannot bring its fighting apparatus into use. Actually, however, it\r\nnever appears to struggle against being swallowed—a remarkable fact\r\nsince nereids fight fiercely among themselves. The reason, it has been\r\npostulated, is that the victim’s nervous system is paralyzed by the\r\npoisonous slime excreted by cerebratulus. When a minute drop of this\r\nis placed on the tongue, it parches the whole mouth and the intensely\r\nbitter taste remains a long time. The worm requires about ten minutes\r\nto swallow a nereid, but by that time the prey is half-digested. The\r\nflow of this mucous is quite copious. When several healthy worms are\r\nplaced in a pail, the bottom is soon filled with a hardening mass of it\r\nfrom which the animals must be cut or pulled. When crawling, the worm\r\nexudes a mucous trail, like a snail.\r\n\r\nA comparable Mediterranean species, Nemertes borlasi, was described by\r\nthe French naturalist Quatrefages:\r\n\r\n“This gigantic worm is from thirty to forty feet long, brown or violet,\r\nand shining as varnished leather. It lurks under stones and in hollows\r\nof rocks where it may be met with, rolled into a ball and coiled in a\r\nthousand seemingly inextricable knots which it is incessantly loosening\r\nand tightening by contraction of its muscles. The animal is nourished\r\nby sucking a kind of small oyster which attaches itself to various\r\nsubstances under water. When it has exhausted the food around, it\r\nextends its long, dark-colored, riband-like body, which is terminated\r\nby a head bearing some likeness to the head of a serpent. It pauses\r\ngently, moves from side to side as if endeavoring to investigate the\r\nground, and finally succeeds in finding a stone to suit its purposes\r\nabout fifteen to twenty feet from its former retreat. It then begins to\r\nunwind its coil and arrange itself in a new domicile. In proportion as\r\none knot is loosened, another forms at the opposite extremity.”\r\n\r\nA report of the Gatty Marine Laboratory of St. Andrews University\r\nin Scotland tells of the species Cerebratulus angulatus, which was\r\nmistaken for a fish. “But when the fisherman stretched out his hand\r\nnet to capture it, instantly to his astonishment it shot out to more\r\nthan a yard long. In the laboratory it swam with undulatory up-and-down\r\nmovements, as an eel swims laterally.”\r\n\r\nThe nemertinea are a progressive race. Some have invaded the deep sea\r\nand some the dry land. They have been obtained from depths of more than\r\n6,000 feet. The deep-sea species have undergone peculiar adaptations\r\nfor a life of swimming slowly or floating idly at whatever depths\r\nthey have chosen for their habitat. They have lost their eyes and\r\ntheir brains are quite rudimentary compared with those of their land\r\nor shallow-water relatives. All have increased greatly the amount of\r\ngelatinous tissue between the internal organs, so that they have a low\r\nspecific gravity. The deep-sea forms thus far collected are broad and\r\nflat. Some have taken on the appearance of small fish with outgrowths\r\non the sides of the body which resemble fins, and with the rear end\r\nflattened like a fish’s tail. Some have developed tentacles around\r\ntheir mouths.\r\n\r\nMost of the ribbon worms of the open sea are nearly transparent. Some,\r\nhowever, are among the most brilliantly colored of the nemertinea race,\r\nwith coat patterns of yellow, orange, red, and scarlet. Most of these\r\ncreatures are small, measuring only a fraction of an inch in length.\r\nThe largest is about six inches long—thus, as one biologist points out,\r\ncomparing to the smallest like an ox to a mouse. These pelagic species\r\nare found in all the oceans. They are carried around the world by\r\ndeep-sea currents.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve species have abandoned the shore for dry land where they\r\nlead active lives and seem to have become almost independent of water.\r\nThey cannot, however, endure being completely dried out. They do not\r\nmake their own burrows, but in periods of drought, it is believed, they\r\nmake use of earthworm burrows. Some have been found under the dead,\r\ndamp bark of tropical trees. Their chief food consists of earthworms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Winged Reptile_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest flying animal the world has known was a winged reptile,\r\nthe pterodactyl, of a hundred million years ago. It had a wing spread\r\nof more than twenty feet, supporting in the air a body which would\r\nhardly have weighed more than thirty pounds. Its head was nearly four\r\nfeet long with a dagger-like, narrow, pointed toothless beak. It lived\r\naround the ancient sea which once extended northwestward from the\r\npresent Gulf of Mexico through most of Kansas. Presumably it lived\r\nentirely on fish and made long, gliding flights over the water.\r\n\r\nThe structure of this reptile, insofar as it could be realized from\r\nfragmentary fossil bones, was studied carefully by Dr. Samuel P.\r\nLangley while he was at work on early models of his airplane. Did the\r\npterodactyl, Dr. Langley asked in a somewhat pessimistic progress\r\nreport, represent the best Nature could do in the way of flight? Could\r\nman hope to do better than Nature?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vicious Fire Ants_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most vicious of insects is the fire ant of South America—a\r\nsmall red ant whose sting burns like the point of a red hot pin pushed\r\ninto the skin. Hordes of these creatures have forced the populace\r\nto abandon Brazilian towns. The soil of a village can be completely\r\nundermined by the ants. The ground is thoroughly perforated by the\r\nentrances to their subterranean galleries.\r\n\r\n“The houses are overrun by them,” says Edward Bates in _A Naturalist on\r\nthe Amazon_. “They dispute every fragment of food with the inhabitants\r\nand destroy clothing for the sake of the starch. All eatables must\r\nbe suspended from rafters in baskets, with the cords well soaked in\r\nbalsam, the only known means of preventing the ants from climbing. They\r\nseem to attack persons out of sheer malice. If we stood for a few hours\r\nin the street, even at a distance from their nests, we were sure to be\r\noverrun and severely punished. The moment an ant touched the flesh he\r\nsecured himself with his jaws, doubled his tail, and stung with all his\r\nmight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Architectural Genius of Birds_\r\n\r\n\r\nBirds rival ants and termites as architects. One species builds nests\r\nas big as small human dwellings—as much as 25 feet long, 15 feet wide\r\nand ten feet high. This is the sociable weaver bird of the desert\r\nwestern areas of South Africa. Such an apartment house, woven out of\r\nsticks and straw, may contain as many as 95 individual nests. It is the\r\ncommunity product of a flock of from 75 to 100 pairs. The sheer bulk\r\nof the nesting material gathered is striking evidence of the impelling\r\nyear-round urge of the building instinct.\r\n\r\nThis bird, says Dr. Herbert Friedmann, Curator of Birds at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, “is about as sociable as any bird could\r\npossibly be. It is always found in flocks, feeds in flocks, and breeds\r\nin the large, many-apartmented compound nests. With this extreme\r\nsocialibility and sedentary habit of life the territorial relations\r\nof the species have been modified in a way that is quite remarkable,\r\nperhaps unique, among birds. Instead of each pair having its own\r\nbreeding territory, each flock seems to have a definite territory whose\r\nboundaries are seldom crossed by individuals of other flocks.\r\n\r\n“In an area of approximately 1,000 square miles I found only 26 nests.\r\nThe flocks ordinarily do not live in very close juxtaposition to each\r\nother. The nests are so large, so conspicuous at great distances, and\r\nthe trees so relatively few in number that I am quite certain I found\r\npractically every nest in the area.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the highly developed communal life, Dr. Friedmann notes,\r\nthere appears to have been no break-down of the family. Whether each\r\nmale has one or several mates, however, is unknown. In the construction\r\nof the apartments there is some evidence that each family builds its\r\nown individual nest, while the whole flock cooperates in constructing\r\na roof over the whole. The structures often become so heavy eventually\r\nthat they crash to the ground and all the work must be done over.\r\n\r\nWoodpeckers that carve “apartment houses” out of hardwood tree trunks\r\nhave been observed by Dr. Alexander Wetmore in the dark, rain-drenched\r\nforests of the La Hotte mountains in Haiti. On one occasion he was\r\nastonished to find a dozen pairs going in and out of nests in a single\r\ndead tree trunk standing in an open space, the holes being from three\r\nto ten meters from the ground and in some cases less than a meter\r\napart. There was no question that the woodpeckers were colonizing,\r\nas the trunk was a veritable apartment house with the birds climbing\r\nactively over its surface and flying back and forth to the nearby\r\nwoodland.\r\n\r\nIn the same mountains Dr. Wetmore found another apartment builder, the\r\npalm chit-chat. It is a gregarious species that lives in small bands,\r\neach being made up of several pairs having a communal nest as the\r\ncenter of its activities. The largest bands frequenting a single nest\r\ndo not appear to contain more than 20 birds.\r\n\r\nThe nests are constructed of twigs about the size of a pencil and from\r\nten to 17 inches in length. The bird itself is only seven or eight\r\ninches long. Yet it is able to carry these heavy “timbers” 30 or 40\r\nfeet from the ground. One of the nests examined was about the size of\r\na bushel basket and evidently was occupied by only a few pairs. There\r\nwas a roughly defined central tunnel four to five inches in diameter\r\nleading through the mass of sticks and opening to the outside at either\r\nend. Near each end was a slight accumulation of bark that made a little\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nThe “apartments” opened from the tunnel on each side. There was a\r\ncentral chamber, supposedly a community room, about five inches in\r\ndiameter, its floor carpeted with fine shreds of bark. Each nest was a\r\nseparate unit, with its own door to the outside. There were, however,\r\nroughly defined passages running through the interlacing twigs at the\r\ntop of the nests that permitted the birds to creep about under cover.\r\n\r\nOne of the most intricate of all bird nests is that of the South\r\nAfrican penuline titmouse, distantly related to the American\r\nchickadees. It is made of a wool-like plant fiber, very intricately\r\nand delicately woven. The form is that of a small bag hanging from a\r\nthorn bush. It has one visible opening, a false one which leads nowhere\r\nand apparently is intended entirely as camouflage. The real entrance\r\nis skillfully hidden, its location known only to the builder. When the\r\nmother bird enters the nest she lifts a concealed flap, slips through,\r\nand closes it behind her. She again closes it just as carefully when\r\nshe leaves the nest. There is not the slightest indication on the\r\nsurface of the finely woven fiber of the existence of the flap.\r\n\r\nThe Ceylon tailor bird, orthotomus sutorius, makes its nest by actually\r\nsewing large leaves together in the shape of a horn, using its bill\r\nas a needle. As described by the British naturalist A. G. Pinto: “The\r\nfirst thing she did was to make with her sharp little beak a number of\r\npunctures along each edge of the leaf. Having thus prepared the leaf,\r\nshe disappeared for a little and returned with a strand of cobweb. One\r\nend of this she wound around the narrow part of the leaf that separated\r\none of the punctures from the edge. Having done this she carried the\r\nloose end of the strand across the under surface of the leaf to a\r\npuncture on the opposite side where she attached it to the leaf, and\r\nthus drew the two edges a little way together. She then proceeded to\r\nconnect most of the other punctures with those opposite them, so that\r\nthe leaf took the form of a tunnel converging to a point. The under\r\nsurface of the leaf formed the roof and sides of the tunnel. There was\r\nno floor to this, since the edges of the leaf did not meet below, the\r\ngap between them being bridged by strands of cobweb.\r\n\r\n“When lining the nest the bird made a number of punctures in the\r\nbody of the leaf, through which she poked the lining with her beak,\r\nthe object being to keep it in situ. All this time the margins of\r\nthe leaf that formed the nest had been held together by the thinnest\r\nstrands of cobweb, and it is a mystery how they could have stood the\r\nstrain. However, before the lining was completed the bird proceeded to\r\nstrengthen them by connecting the punctures on opposite edges of the\r\nleaf with threads of cotton. She would push one end of a thread through\r\na puncture. The cotton used is soft and frays easily so that the part\r\nof it forced through a tiny aperture issues as a fluffy knob, which\r\nlooks like a knot and usually is taken as such. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe bird makes no knots. She merely forces a portion of the cotton\r\nstrand through a puncture and the silicon in the leaf catches the\r\nstrands and prevents them from slipping. Sometimes the cotton threads\r\nare long enough to admit of their being passed to and fro, in which\r\ncase the bird uses the full length.”\r\n\r\nThe leaves are not killed by the tailoring process and remain green.\r\nHence the nest is almost impossible to detect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ferocious Leech Worms_\r\n\r\n\r\nArmies of billions of ferocious worms defended and preserved a fabulous\r\n1,000-year-old Arabian Nights kingdom for three centuries. This kingdom\r\nwas templed Kandy in the center of Ceylon, encircled by low, densely\r\nforested mountains. It was the site of one of the most picturesque\r\nancient civilizations of the Orient which had degenerated into a brutal\r\ndespotism when the first European invaders, the Portuguese, came to the\r\nisland early in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nArmed with arquebuses, the white man established missions and trading\r\nposts on the coast with little difficulty, but the forested mountains\r\nproved impassable. The Portuguese soldiers were hard put to pitch their\r\ncamps in deep jungle bush and in bug-filled marshes. Grass and bushes\r\nswarmed with little green worms—extremely nimble creatures about an\r\ninch long which subsisted on the blood of warm-blooded animals. They\r\nseemed to prefer human blood. They attacked the soldiers night and day.\r\nClothes were no protection. The worms dropped in streams of blood from\r\neyelids and ears. They swarmed on all sides in ever-increasing numbers\r\nas the invading forces penetrated further into the jungle. With no\r\ndefense against this unanticipated enemy, the Europeans were forced to\r\nretreat long before the temples of Kandy were in sight. They made no\r\nfurther effort to conquer the ancient kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Dutchmen who followed the Portuguese were content to remain in\r\ntheir barricaded coastal trading posts. A century later came the\r\nBritish East India Company with a small army of Sepoys commanded\r\nby British officers. The ruler of Kandy, quite secure within his\r\ngreen-worm defenses, was Raja Sinha, one of the cruelest of Oriental\r\ndespots. He spurned all overtures at negotiation with officers of the\r\ntrading company.\r\n\r\nOnce again his kingdom was invaded. During the march into the mountains\r\nthe Sepoy soldiers suffered so badly from the attacks of the worms that\r\nsome died and many others deserted. The force was so badly depleted\r\nthat further advance became impossible. Only when British regulars\r\ntook over the invasion years later was an armed force of white men\r\nable to reach Kandy. Previously only individuals, chiefly Portuguese\r\nFranciscans, had been able to cross the terrible green-worm barrier.\r\n\r\nSir Emerson Tennent, British historian of Ceylon, describes these worms\r\nas normally about an inch long, slender as needles, and able to stretch\r\ntheir bodies to double the ordinary length. Ceylonese natives had been\r\nable to protect themselves to some extent by smearing their bodies with\r\nlemon juice and tobacco ashes.\r\n\r\n“On descrying the prey,” says Tennent, “they advance rapidly by\r\nsemi-circular strides, fixing one end firmly and arching the other\r\nforward until by successive advances they can lay hold of the\r\ntraveller’s foot, when they disengage from the ground and ascend his\r\ndress in search of an aperture. The wound they make is so skillfully\r\npunctured that the first intimation is the trickling of blood or the\r\nchill feeling of the worm as it begins to land heavily on the skin.”\r\n\r\nThese worms, hirudinae or leeches, are remotely related to earthworms\r\nwith a quite similar internal structure, but highly specialized for\r\nan exclusive diet of warm blood which they take from any mammal that\r\ncomes within reach. The blood-sucking species—not all species are this\r\ntype—have triangular mouths with extremely sharp chitinous [of the\r\nsame material as the shells of insects] teeth. The bite, so rapidly\r\nand skillfully administered that it seldom is felt, has been described\r\nas resembling the movement of a circular saw. Haemadipoa, the Ceylon\r\nspecies, described by Tennent, reportedly has five pairs of keen\r\neyes and as many as 100 body segments. All the blood eaters have two\r\nsuckers, one on the front and one on the rear of the body, by means of\r\nwhich they cling to their victims. All have the ability to contract the\r\nbody to a plump, pear-like form and extend it to a wormlike form.\r\n\r\nThe green worms are as much of a terror as ever to travelers in Asian\r\njungles. A species akin to that of the Kandy defense armies guards the\r\nthickly forested approaches to the Himalayas in Nepal It is described\r\nby Dr. George Moore, chief of the United Nations medical mission to\r\nNepal:\r\n\r\n“These leeches, little segmented worms about two inches long, were\r\nparticularly provoking and troublesome until our team reached an\r\naltitude of 14,000 feet. Along the trails, on each ledge leading to\r\nthe pass, leeches would lie in the shade and moisture until nearby\r\nfootsteps vibrated their sense organs. Then they would inch from rock\r\nto rock at incredible speed, traveling their entire length toward the\r\nsound in about a second and then stopping to perch on the rock with\r\ntheir front ends sticking in the air. Immediately they touched a human\r\nbody they would fasten themselves to it and search for warm skin.\r\nOften they would drop from trees. They could penetrate eyelets of\r\nshoes and pores of socks by lengthening the entire body. Huge clots of\r\nblood would be found on the skin where the greedy worms had fattened\r\nthemselves to a fragile bursting point.”\r\n\r\nThe leech encountered by Dr. Moore’s mission long has been notorious as\r\none of the most vicious animals on earth. It has made some areas of the\r\nHimalayan foothills uninhabitable. Travelers and hunters are terrified\r\nby it. It exists in incalculable numbers and attacks at least all\r\nwarm-blooded animals. Horses are driven wild. Cattle and dogs sometimes\r\nare blinded and the young and sick killed. It has been known to attack\r\nthe deadly cobra, striking at the eyes and blinding the reptiles.\r\nThe respect in which it is held in indicated by its zoological name\r\nmontivindictus, or “defender of the mountains.”\r\n\r\nIts stronghold is the highly humid zone at the foot of the Himalayas\r\nbetween altitudes of 4,000 and 6,000 feet. Its period of activity\r\noccurs during the rainy season, when it can move freely without danger\r\nof drying out. At other times it seldom is seen except at night when\r\ngrass and bushes are wet with dew.\r\n\r\nThe worm lurks at the bases of plants. It is stirred to action by\r\nthe slightest movement of stems or vibration caused by footfalls. An\r\ninherent impulse, or geotropism, then impels it to climb any plant or\r\nvertical object with which it happens to be in contact. At the top it\r\nextends its body horizontally and probes the surroundings.\r\n\r\nOnce a victim is found, the hungry worm seeks a thin patch of skin\r\nrichly supplied with blood capillaries. There it attaches itself by\r\nmeans of the cup-like sucker at the front end of its body. Immediately\r\nbehind this cup are three radiating ridges, or jaws, each provided\r\nwith about 70 sharp teeth. With these three rows of teeth it cuts\r\nthree duplicate slits on the skin, meeting at a common center. From\r\nthe star-shaped wound the warm blood is sucked. Meanwhile from its own\r\nglands the leech secretes hirudin, a substance which prevents blood\r\ncoagulation, and also some as yet unknown substance which preserves\r\nblood. The blood is pumped into a storage tank in the leech’s stomach.\r\nAt a single feeding the animal can store up as much as three-fold its\r\nown weight. Then it can live as long as three months without another\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Complex Spider’s Web_\r\n\r\n\r\nA single strand of a spider’s web may consist of several thousand\r\nseparate filaments. On the creature’s abdomen are four to six teat-like\r\norgans. Each secretes through several hundred extremely minute tubes a\r\nviscous fluid which hardens immediately when exposed to air. The spider\r\nattaches its abdomen to some solid object and pulls out the threads by\r\nmoving its body forward. The hind feet are used to bring the hundreds\r\nof filaments into a single thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monsters of the Deep: The Great Squids_\r\n\r\n\r\nGiants of the mollusk family and about the most loathsomely fantastic\r\ncreatures on earth are the great squids. One may weigh as much as half\r\na ton. The largest known specimen, a replica of which is among the\r\nSmithsonian Institution exhibits, was 55 feet long. It had ten arms,\r\ntwo of them approximately 35 feet long and two-and-a-half inches in\r\ndiameter. Its eye measured seven by nine inches. Many strange sea\r\nserpent stories have been told by persons who merely saw a writhing arm\r\nof one of these creatures on the surface. In recent years, however,\r\nthere has been no reliable report of an encounter with such an animal\r\nand it may be close to extinction. Normally it is a denizen of profound\r\ndepths and darkness and presumably shuns light. It is associated\r\nchiefly with the North Atlantic, especially around Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nThere are not more than a dozen entirely authenticated accounts of\r\nseeing the monster. Just after the middle of the last century, Rev.\r\nMr. Harvey of St. Johns, Newfoundland, began to gather “sea devil”\r\nreports from fishermen and these constitute a substantial portion of\r\nthe literature on the subject. He reported that in 1874 two St. Johns\r\nfishermen in an open boat observed an object floating in the water\r\nwhich they thought to be wreckage: “When they approached it reared its\r\nparrot-like beak, big as a six-gallon keg with which it struck the\r\nbottom of the boat violently. It then shot out from around its head two\r\nhuge, livid arms and began to entwine them around the boat. One of the\r\nmen seized an axe and cut off both arms as they lay over the gunwale,\r\nwhereupon the creature moved off and ejected an immense quantity of\r\ninky fluid which darkened the water for two or three hundred yards.\r\n\r\n“Early in the morning of November 21, 1877,” Harvey informed Prof.\r\nAddison E. Verrill of Yale, “a big squid was seen on the beach at\r\nTrinity Bay, still alive and struggling desperately to escape. It\r\nhad been carried in by the tide and a high inshore wind. In its\r\nstruggles to get off it ploughed a trench or furrow 30 feet long and\r\nof considerable depth by the stream of water which it ejected with\r\ngreat force from its syphon. When the tide receded it died. The body\r\nwas eleven feet long, with tentacle arms 33 feet long. The shorter arms\r\nwere about eleven feet long.”\r\n\r\n“In 1878,” Harvey reported, “Stephen Sherring, a fisherman residing\r\nin Thimble Tickle, was out in a boat with two other men. Not far from\r\nshore they observed some bulky object and supposing it might be part of\r\na wreck they moved towards it. To their horror they found themselves\r\nclose to a huge fish with large, glassy eyes, which was making\r\ndesperate efforts to escape and churning the water into foam by the\r\nmotions of its immense arms and tail. It was aground and the tide was\r\nebbing.\r\n\r\n“Finding the monster partially disabled, the fishermen plucked up\r\ncourage and ventured near enough to throw the grapnel of their boat,\r\nthe sharp flukes of which, having sharp points, sunk into the soft\r\nbody. To the grapnel they had attached a long rope which they carried\r\nashore and tied to a tree to prevent the fish going out with the tide.\r\nHis struggles were terrific as he flung his ten arms about in dying\r\nagony. Ever and anon the long tentacles darted out like great tongues\r\nfrom the central mass. At length it became exhausted and when the water\r\nreceded it expired. The body measured twenty feet from the beak to the\r\nextremity of the tail. The fishermen, knowing no better, proceeded to\r\nconvert it to dog meat.”\r\n\r\nAt about the same time H. T. Bennett of English Harbor, Newfoundland,\r\nwrote a newspaper account quoted by Prof. Verrill: “A giant cephalopod\r\nwas run ashore at Coomb’s Cove whose body measured ten feet in length\r\nand was as big around as a hogshead. One arm 42 feet long and about\r\nthe size of a man’s wrist. The other arms were only six feet long but\r\nnine inches in diameter and very stout and strong. The skin and flesh\r\nwere 2.25 inches thick and reddish inside as well as out. The suction\r\ncups were all clustered together near the extremity of the long arm and\r\neach cup was surrounded by a serrated edge, almost like the teeth of a\r\nhandsaw. I presume it made use of this arm for a cable and the cups for\r\nanchors when it wanted to come to as well as to secure its prey. This\r\nindividual, finding a heavy sea was driving it ashore tail first seized\r\nhold of a rock and moored itself quite safely until the men pulled it\r\nashore. It was probably a female.”\r\n\r\nThe monstrous ten-tentacled mollusk fights terrible battles with\r\nwhales and sometimes large parts of tentacles are spewed by leviathan\r\nin its death agonies. So far as known only one such battle ever has\r\nbeen witnessed and described. The British author Frank T. Bullen in\r\nthe _Cruise of the Cachelot_ tells of seeing in the South Indian ocean\r\n“a very large sperm whale locked in deadly conflict with a cuttlefish\r\nalmost as large as himself whose interminable tentacles seemed to\r\nenlace the whole of his body. The head of the whale seemed a perfect\r\nnetwork of writhing arms. It appeared as if the whale had the tail\r\npart of the mollusk in his jaws and in a businesslike, methodical way\r\nwas sawing through it. By the side of the black, columnar head of the\r\nwhale appeared the head of the great squid, as awful a sight as one\r\ncould well imagine in a feverish dream. I established it to be as large\r\nat least as one of our pipes which contained 350 gallons. The eyes\r\nwere very remarkable from their size and blackness contrasted with the\r\nlivid whiteness of the head. They were at least a foot in diameter. All\r\naround the combatants were numerous sharks, like jackals round a lion,\r\napparently assisting in the destruction of the huge cephalopod.\r\n\r\n“The occasions when these big cuttlefish appear on the surface must be\r\nvery rare. From their construction they appear fitted only to grope\r\namong rocks at the bottom of the ocean. Their normal position is head\r\ndownward, with tentacles spread like ribs of an umbrella. The two long\r\nones, like the antennae of an insect, rove unceasingly around seeking\r\nprey. In the center of the network of living traps is a chasm-like\r\nmouth with an enormous parrot-like beak.”\r\n\r\n“Insatiable nightmares of the sea,” the French philosopher Michelet\r\ncalled the creatures. Nothing is known, of course, of their numbers\r\nor of their ways of life in the dark depths. The few seen or captured\r\nprobably have been sick or badly injured. It has been estimated that\r\none female may lay as many 40,000 eggs in a season, but the mortality\r\nof eggs and young must be enormous. It is doubtful if one in a million\r\never becomes a mature animal.\r\n\r\nA scarcely less fantastic animal, but more familiar and far less\r\nfearsome, is the eight-tentacled octopus. Some of the largest are found\r\noff the coast of Alaska. The largest known had arms 16 feet long and a\r\nradial spread of 28 feet, but the central body itself was not more than\r\nsix inches wide and a foot long.\r\n\r\nMost familiar of the race is the Mediterranean octopus; its tentacles\r\noften are sold for food in Sicilian markets. The largest known was\r\nnine feet long and weighed about 50 pounds. This animal reportedly was\r\ncaptured by a fisherman with his bare hands. One specimen found dead on\r\na beach near Nassau had tentacles five feet long and weighed more than\r\n200 pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather sluggish, timid animal which seeks shelter in holes and\r\ncrevasses among offshore rocks. It feeds mainly on clams and oysters.\r\nWhen frightened it surrounds itself with a cloud of ink-like fluid.\r\nThere is no reliable reason to believe it ever attacks man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vanishing Whippoorwill_\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably not one person in a thousand has ever seen a whippoorwill.\r\nIts melancholy song is one of the most familiar chords in the symphony\r\nof the summer evening but to the majority of listeners it is only a\r\ndisembodied voice in the dark. The singer has come about as near to\r\nachieving invisibility as any living creature.\r\n\r\nThe whippoorwill is a migrant bird, spending its winters in Florida and\r\nits summers from March to October in the north. It travels entirely\r\nat night, sometimes in large flocks. It builds no nest but lays its\r\nflecked eggs on the ground depending on the flickering shadows of the\r\nwoodland over the background of dried leaves to conceal them.\r\n\r\nThe bird is masterfully camouflaged by nature and usually selects a\r\nspot for its eggs where the woodland floor is free of underbrush and\r\nthe trees are spaced far enough apart to cast an uneven shade. The male\r\npresumably sleeps all day while the female sits on the eggs or broods\r\nthe newly hatched young, but at night he stands guard, may take his\r\nturn on the nest, and hunts insects for his mate.\r\n\r\nThe chick, almost exactly the color of the dead leaves among which it\r\nlies, remains essentially invisible. Nests are found only by accident.\r\n\r\nWhippoorwills live almost exclusively on night-flying insects,\r\nespecially moths and mosquitoes. They have been recorded, however, as\r\nsometimes hunting for worms, beetles and ants under bark, or on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe bird makes no particular effort to conceal itself from humans.\r\nApparently it does not regard them as dangerous. There are cases where\r\nit actually has lit on the head of a man standing motionless in the\r\ndark. The female has been observed to fly about carrying her young\r\nbetween her thighs. She also, it has been reported, sometimes carries\r\nthem in her bill, but there is no satisfactory evidence of this.\r\n\r\nThe whippoorwill is fond of taking dust baths. Sometimes one is caught\r\nby the lights of an approaching auto as it dusts itself in the middle\r\nof a country road.\r\n\r\nThe bird is remarkable for the regularity of its song and for the\r\nnumber of times the melancholy refrain is repeated without a pause.\r\nFrom 150 to 200 is not unusual. The naturalist John Burroughs claimed\r\nonce to have counted 1058 such repetitions. The song is continuous from\r\ndusk until about 9:30 and from about 2 until dawn. It is heard rarely\r\nin the intervening hours.\r\n\r\nThe whippoorwill, it is pointed out in a Smithsonian report, has come\r\nto depend almost exclusively on darkness for its protection. For this\r\nreason it has suffered little, as have many other birds, with the\r\ncutting away of the forests and the advances of cities. Its enemies in\r\nthe dark are some hawks, owls and foxes, but has exceptional powers of\r\nflight which often enable it to escape even when discovered.\r\n\r\nThe birds linger in the north only until the first killing frosts which\r\ndestroy or drive into shelter the insects on which they feed. Then they\r\nstart their night migrations southward which sometimes carry them as\r\nfar as Central America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ants Can Smell Almost Anything_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell is remarkably acute in all ants—at least equalling\r\nthat of dogs.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding ant odor is that of formic acid, which is somewhat like\r\nthat of illuminating gas, exuded from the bodies of all species. But\r\nthis is only the smell of the race. It must be subject to an infinite\r\nnumber of variations to most of which ants alone are sensitive. They\r\nknow their comrades, even after a long separation. Famed naturalist\r\nSir John Lubbock once returned some ants to their old nest after a\r\nseparation of 21 months. They were amicably received and evidently\r\nrecognized as friends. On the other hand if a strange ant is placed in\r\na nest of her own species she is at once attacked.\r\n\r\nDr. William M. Wheeler insists that even the human nose can detect some\r\ndifferent species and even, in a few cases, different castes by their\r\nodors. Thus, over and above the formic acid smell, the smell of one\r\nspecies suggests ether, of another lemon-geranium, and of still another\r\nrotten coconuts.\r\n\r\nAt least one species of ant has three distinct odors: 1. A scent\r\ndeposited by the feet, forming an individual trail by which she\r\nretraces her own steps. 2. An inherent odor of the whole body which is\r\nidentical for all of the same lineage and a means of recognizing blood\r\nrelatives. 3. A nest odor, consisting of the commingled odors of all\r\nmembers of the colony, used to distinguish their nest from the nests of\r\naliens.\r\n\r\nEvidently the odor of ants changes with age. It has been pointed out\r\nthat “a cause of feud between ants of the same species living in\r\ndifferent communities is a difference of odor arising out of difference\r\nof age in the queen whose progeny constitute the communities.” Ants\r\napparently not only differentiate the innate odors peculiar to the\r\nspecies, sex, caste and individual, but also the incurred odor of the\r\nnest and environment. As worker ants advance in age their progressive\r\nodor intensifies or changes to such a degree that they may be said to\r\nattain a new odor every two or three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fish That Fish For Fish_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are fish that fish for fish with worms. That is, they use\r\nwormlike appendages of their own bodies, developed through millenia\r\nof evolution, to catch worm-eating fellow fishes. This curious quirk\r\nof fishing fish is revealed in a bulletin of the International\r\nOceanographic Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe practice is confined to the pediculati, known as angler fishes.\r\nThe best known of them lies on the bottom partially concealed in sand\r\nor mud. One of the spines of its dorsal fin is extended in the form\r\nof a jointed fishing rod. At the end there is a fleshy lump, with a\r\nstriking resemblance to one of the most tasty marine worms. The fish\r\nlies perfectly still with its enormous mouth closed, while the wormlike\r\nend of its rod waves to and fro. Other fishes approach the lure until\r\nthey come within striking range. Then the great mouth opens with\r\nremarkable speed and engulfs the prey, which is prevented from escaping\r\nby backward-directed teeth.\r\n\r\nSome other deep-sea anglers have luminous lures at the tip of the rod,\r\nsomewhat like a small, light-emitting fish. In the total darkness of\r\ndeep waters this is fatally attractive. Because of the huge size of the\r\nangler’s mouth the prey may be almost as large as the fisherman. Other\r\ndeep-sea fishes dispense with the rod but have light-emitting organs on\r\nthe sides of the body. These must play some part in attracting other\r\nsea animals. Some of these luminous fishes are able to swallow other\r\nfishes many times their own size because of their ability to distend\r\ntheir mouths and throats.\r\n\r\nAbout all the ways man has devised for catching fish have been devised\r\nby fishes themselves long before man came on the scene. Traps—for\r\nexample. There is a fish in Florida waters known as the greater sand\r\neel. It lies buried in the sand, with its great mouth open. A relative,\r\nthe lesser sand eel, when frightened dives into what seems like an\r\nopening in the sand. The result is that the greater sand eel is nearly\r\nalways found with a lesser sand eel, head down, in its stomach.\r\n\r\nThe ways of fish are being studied with the possibility of finding\r\nsomething human fishermen have not yet thought about. Thus far nothing\r\nstrikingly new has developed. There recently has been much interest,\r\nsays the report, in “electric fishing—either stunning fish or directing\r\nthem into nets by means of electric currents.” But, it is pointed out,\r\n“the fishes themselves have long ago adopted this for their own use.”\r\nThe electric ray on each side of its flat, round body has an area in\r\nwhich numerous cells are modified to produce electricity. This is\r\nnot really so amazing when we consider that electrical impulses are\r\ngenerated normally in small amounts by both nerve and muscle cells.\r\nIn these particular fishes, however, the electrical impulses are\r\nconsiderable and the arrangement of cells, like those of a battery,\r\nbuilds up a total electric potential sufficient to stun or even kill\r\nsmaller animals in the surrounding water.\r\n\r\nIn only one case has man been able to use fish to catch fish. This has\r\nbeen by means of the remora, or sucking fish, which has the habit of\r\nattaching itself by means of suckers to other fishes. In 1494 Columbus\r\nwitnessed the use of a captive remora for capturing turtles. It still\r\nis used for this purpose in parts of Australia and China.\r\n\r\nThe sucker fish has quite strong powers of adhesion. In the ordinary\r\ncourse of its life it attaches itself to sharks or other large fishes\r\nand enjoys a free ride until it comes across food. When used for\r\nfishing, it is fastened with a line around its tail and tethered to the\r\ncanoe. The native paddles as close as possible to the intended victim\r\nwithout disturbing it. The remora then is thrown into the water toward\r\nthe turtle, to which it automatically attaches itself. Once the remora\r\nis securely fixed to the turtle, the fisherman carefully plays his\r\nlight line until the reptile is brought into the boat. This must be\r\ndone with care because of the diving habits of turtles. They are likely\r\nto run away with lines, sucker fishes and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms That Are Flowers_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are carnation worms and chrysanthemum worms. There are fairy\r\ngardens of worm asters and cornflowers at the bottom of the sea. Pink,\r\nred, purple, green, and yellow petals are tentacles of worms whose\r\ntube-encased bodies, stems of the flowers animals, are buried in\r\ninshore bottom ooze or mud-filled rock crevices.\r\n\r\nAmong these worms are masons and architects that build the houses in\r\nwhich they pass their lives brick by brick and pebble by pebble, with\r\nan exquisite craftsmanship hardly rivaled among animals. The blossoms\r\nand architecture have, so far as known, no utilitarian function.\r\nNature is a painter and a poet. Forever she probes with intellect,\r\ninstinct, and emotion to capture fleeting fragments of colors, lights,\r\nand harmonies of the ineffable which can be woven into the material\r\ngarments of life. Among her notable successes are the sabellids and\r\nserpulids and terefillids. They are tube-dwellers—thus distinguished\r\nfrom their free-wandering kin—polychaetes such as the fearsome\r\nAphrodites. Many of them have been given the names of the golden-haired\r\nnymphs who, mounted on sea horses, formed the retinue of Poseidon\r\nin mythology. Loveliest of these nymphs was Amphitrite, who became\r\nthe bride of the sea god and queen of the coral-forested deep. Quite\r\nappropriately, among the fairest of the sabellids is the amphitrite,\r\nessentially world-wide in distribution.\r\n\r\nThese worms are especially facile as builders. One, for example, makes\r\nthe brick with which it erects the cylindrical house that is its home\r\nfor life. Extending from its head are sixteen tentacles, eight on each\r\nside, fringed with petal-like outgrowths. These tentacles are joined by\r\nmembranes at the base so that, when extended, they have the appearance\r\nof two fans. When the fans are brought in contact, they form a funnel\r\nwith which the animal collects mud. At the bottom of this funnel is “a\r\nsingular organ by which the mud, mixed with a cement-like secretion of\r\nthe worm itself, is moulded into pellets. These pellets are laid, one\r\nby one, like bricks, to form the walls of a flexible tube from twelve\r\nto fifteen inches long and about as thick as a goose quill.”\r\n\r\nThis particular British sea worm, Amphitrite ventilabrum, is almost as\r\nnotable for the beauty of its blossom as for its masonry. Each of the\r\ntentacles has about a thousand of the petal-like processes and each of\r\nthese, it is claimed, is capable of some degree of independent action.\r\n“It is no exaggeration to affirm,” wrote the eighteenth-century British\r\nbiologist Sir John Dalyell, “that the will of this lowly, defenseless\r\ncreature is fulfilled by control of at least twenty thousand living\r\nparts.”\r\n\r\nThe color of the petals is basically straw-yellow, dotted and banded\r\nwith brown, rouge, red, and green. “While dredging in the river Roach,”\r\nDalyell reported, “I have come upon banks where these worms existed\r\nin hundreds of thousands and appear in masses of large extent growing\r\nerect like standing fields of corn.”\r\n\r\nOf another British tube builder which builds tubes of cemented shells\r\nor pebbles near the roots of large sea weeds, Rev. Richard Johnston\r\nsays: “Sabellarid angilica is a timid, lively, active creature whose\r\nmost prominent ability is that of constructing a dwelling for itself\r\nfrom sand grains. It is firm, durable, and capable of great resistance.\r\nThey are not easily crushed. Some appear much more brittle. Most of the\r\ndwellings are lined with a soft, silky substance formed of exudations\r\nfrom the body. The worms have a great preference in building materials.\r\nThey always prefer sand or shells. Powdered glass is used reluctantly\r\nand soon rejected. Some tubes are short and confined, others\r\nconsiderably prolonged so as to afford safe retreats in danger. Some\r\narchitects seem to persist in prolonging the fabric as long as material\r\ncan be found. They never weary of working. Grains of sand are selected\r\nand adopted for precise spots and gelatinous matter secures them in the\r\ntube walls.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most notable of all the worm builders is a five-inch-long\r\nspecies found in South African waters, pectinaris capensis, described\r\nby Sir John McIntosh: “The beautiful straight tube formed by this\r\nanimal was composed of the spicules of sponges in short lengths placed\r\ntraversely and fixed by secretion so as to form a perfectly round\r\ntunnel gently tapered from the wide to the narrow end. The spicules\r\nappeared of the same size throughout the tube. The inner surface was\r\nas smoothly formed as the outer. The labor involved in selecting and\r\nfitting with such marvelous skill the sponge spicules composing so\r\nlarge a tube must have been very arduous. One tube lasts the animal for\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nMcIntosh tells of another South African architect worm that “builds out\r\nof grains of sand arranged in a single layer like miniature masonry and\r\nbound together by waterproof cement.”\r\n\r\nThere are, however, widely differing degrees of artistry among the\r\ntube-dwelling polychaetes. Some tubes are rough, fragile, long, bent\r\nin various directions, and united in colonies several inches to a\r\nfoot across. Sometimes tubes three to four inches long are attached\r\nhorizontally to the undersides of rocks.\r\n\r\nA large and singular terebellid is Amphitrite ornata—twelve to fifteen\r\ninches long with orange-brown tentacles capable of being extended eight\r\nto ten inches. These are kept in constant motion gathering food and\r\nmaterial for building. The bodies of these worms are filled with blood,\r\nbut there is no circulatory system. The blood, however, apparently\r\ncan be forced into any part of the body by muscular contractions. The\r\ntentacles can be turned voluntarily in any direction by forcing blood\r\ninto them.\r\n\r\nTube-building, flowering worms excited the wonder of Quatrefages as he\r\nobserved them along the Bay of Biscay in the nineteenth century:\r\n\r\n“On these coasts so violently beaten by waves we often observe small\r\nhillocks of sand pierced by an infinite number of minute openings.\r\nThese little hillocks which look very much like thick pieces of\r\nhoneycomb are in reality populous cities in which live in modest\r\nseclusion tubiculous annelids, the hermellas—(sabellarids) as curious\r\nas any that fall under the notice of the naturalist. The body,\r\nabout two inches in length, is terminated in front by a bifurcated\r\n[two-forked] head bearing a bright double golden crown of strong,\r\nsharp silk threads. These brilliant crowns are not mere ornaments, but\r\nare the two sides of a solid door, or rather true portcullis, which\r\nhermetically closes the entrance to the habitation when, at the least\r\nalarm, the worm darts with the rapidity of lightning within its house\r\nof sand.\r\n\r\n“From the edges of the head of this worm issue fifty to sixty slender,\r\nlight-violet filaments which are incessantly moving about like numerous\r\nminute serpents. They are so many arms which can be lengthened or\r\nshortened at will and which, seizing the prey as it passes, bring it to\r\nthe hollow, funnel-shaped mouth. On the sides of the body appear little\r\nprojections from which issue bundles of sharp and cutting lances.\r\nFinally, the back is covered with cirrhi, recurved like circles, whose\r\ncolor varies from dark red to deep green.”\r\n\r\nMost conspicuously flowerlike among the worms are the serpulids—“little\r\nsnakes.”\r\n\r\nFound the world over, they furnish passable imitations of practically\r\nall the flowers in an old-fashioned Virginia garden. Among them, for\r\nexample, are the animals of inshore South African waters, described\r\nby Prof. McIntosh. Their wreaths of branchia “look like pinks, but in\r\nsome varieties are purple at the base, with narrow bands of bright red\r\nand pale green. In one variety the blossoms are yellow or orange and\r\nthe body is usually greenish-yellow.” “The instant it is disturbed,”\r\nMcIntosh says, “this worm withdraws its lovely wreath into its tube and\r\ncloses the aperture with a curious plug, funnel-shaped and placed at\r\nthe end of a rather long pedicle.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. D. Johnston describes a British flower worm (one of the\r\nsabellids) about an inch long, whose eight-inch-long tubes grow\r\ntogether, attached at the bottom to a stone or abandoned shell. The\r\ntube has a silk-like lining.\r\n\r\n“Into this tube,” says Johnston, “it can withdraw with lightning-like\r\nrapidity when alarmed. Extending across its back is a row of\r\nmicroscopic hooks, or 14,000 to 15,000 teeth. These are used to catch\r\nthe lining of the tube and draw the worm back.”\r\n\r\nThe filaments which form its blossoms, he says, are comb-like, arranged\r\nin two rows, one on each side of the mouth. They form a coronet. Under\r\nlow magnification each is seen as a pellucid, cartilaginous stem from\r\none side of which springs a double series of secondary filaments\r\nthrough which red blood can be seen flowing.\r\n\r\nSome of the most conspicuous flower worms are found alone: the\r\nAtlantic coast of the United States. On diving into Chesapeake Bay one\r\nencounters tiny, colored clusters of feathers that are really gills\r\nof annelid worms. They flick instantly out of sight as their owners\r\nwithdraw into tubes in the rock crevices. The blossoms are bright\r\norange, each surrounded by a white haze caused by thousands of minute\r\ntentacles straining the water for the tiny organisms upon which they\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\nFrom New Jersey to Cape Cod is to be found a purple-blooming serpulid\r\nwith white stems of calcium carbonate three to four inches long and an\r\neighth of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nA widely distributed family related to the serpulids are the\r\nfabricinae, or “feather dusters.” These animals, only a few millimeters\r\nlong, live in the upper layers of mud in tidal basins. They are so\r\nthoroughly covered with slime and debris that they are likely to be\r\ncompletely overlooked. The body is thread-like except for the crown of\r\ntentacles, with from seventy to a hundred featherlike filaments. In\r\nsome varieties these are white, in others translucent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Heavy Toll of Bird Migrations_\r\n\r\n\r\nA migration that takes a toll of millions of lives takes place every\r\nyear between North and South America.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Wetmore of the Smithsonian has had the experience of\r\nstanding on a lonely beach on the coast of Venezuela and actually\r\nwatching North American birds arrive at the end of their gruelling\r\njourney, exhausted and emaciated. Every day over his camp on the shore\r\npassed familiar birds from home—sandpipers, yellowlegs, bobolinks, barn\r\nswallows and warblers.\r\n\r\n“There was brought to me more definitely than ever before,” Dr. Wetmore\r\nreported, “the tremendous loss of life that this journey entails. The\r\nwastage of modern human battlefields, though terrific beyond words,\r\nis nothing in comparison. On this open shore small feathered migrants\r\noften made a landfall in a state of evident exhaustion. In the early\r\nmorning I found little groups of them feeding on the short herbage.\r\nSome obviously had barely made a landfall after an exhausting sea\r\njourney. In some of those that I handled the flight muscles that move\r\nthe wings were reduced to thin bands through which the angular ridges\r\nof the breast bones protruded. It was easy to visualize the hundreds of\r\nthousands that had wandered over the water until they fell to drown,\r\nand the hundreds of others that arrived only to succumb to the strains\r\nimposed by their exhausting journey.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deadly Snakes That Take Life Easy_\r\n\r\n\r\nDeadliest of serpents are the Pacific sea snakes. A bite almost\r\ncertainly would be fatal to a human being. Yet native children of\r\nthe Palau Islands in the South Pacific play with these reptiles with\r\ncomplete impunity. They pick them up and toss them from one to another\r\njust as American children play “catch.” Natives of the Palaus look\r\nupon the reptiles with complete indifference.\r\n\r\nThe term “sea snake” is somewhat of a misnomer. Actually the creatures\r\nspend most of their days asleep among rocks on beaches. They are\r\nexcellent tree climbers and like to sun themselves in crotches of\r\nbranches. At dusk, however, they move out to the reefs where presumably\r\nthey spend most of the night pursuing small fishes, their principal\r\nfood. They are excellent swimmers and their bodies have been somewhat\r\nmodified, with flattened, paddle-like tails, for sea life.\r\n\r\nFortunately, on land at least, they are sluggish and non-aggressive.\r\nThey hardly can be induced to bite and will suffer almost any indignity\r\nwithout retaliating. About the only way a person would be likely to\r\nbe bitten would be by stepping directly on the head of one of these\r\nsnakes with bare feet. This is an unlikely event, for the sea snakes do\r\nnot spend any time under shallow water where they would be a peril for\r\nbathers.\r\n\r\nSome are quite beautiful, about five feet long and banded with black\r\nand white. Their capture is easy. It is simply a matter of pinning down\r\nthe head with a stick and picking up the snake by the neck.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire sea snake area in the Pacific there are only five\r\nor six instances reported where the serpents have bitten humans. In\r\nevery case the victim has died; there is no anti-venom against the sea\r\nsnake toxin.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Dr. Herbert Clark, former director of the Gorgas\r\nMemorial Laboratory, dove off a boat in Balboa harbor and swam ashore,\r\na distance of about 200 yards. As he neared the shore there were\r\nalarmed cries from the deck he had left. Dr. Clark looked around. He\r\nfound he had unwittingly swum through a school of several thousand\r\nblack and white serpents, each about two feet long. None had touched\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weird Plant-Animals_\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the bottom of life’s pyramid there is a weird race of\r\nplant-animals. They are among the closest of all many-celled living\r\nthings to the primaeval protoplasm from which all life arose.\r\n\r\nThey are the slime molds found on decaying logs and tree stumps in\r\ndamp woods or on piles of rain-soaked dead leaves in shady gardens.\r\nThe nightmarish mycetozoa—botanists call them myxomycetes—are timeless\r\nsurvivals out of living creation’s dank, warm cradle. Some of the\r\nweirdest imaginings of malevolent life on other planets picture it in\r\nthe form of gigantic slime mold aggregations—undifferentiated masses of\r\nnaked protoplasm endowed with a malign intelligence which has evolved\r\nwithout the intermediaries of nervous systems or brains.\r\n\r\nThese organisms can be considered one of nature’s probing experiments\r\ntowards higher forms of life. The experiment was a failure, but unlike\r\nmost of nature’s discards these organisms have survived. Even now they\r\nmay be engaged in a process of evolution all their own.\r\n\r\nBiologists are not entirely agreed in which kingdom to place the\r\norganisms, although they usually are classified with the plants. They\r\nstart life as spores, like the dust of molds or toadstools whose\r\nsingle-celled particles serve the same reproductive function as seeds\r\nin higher plants. From each spore arises from one to four animal-like\r\norganisms, hardly distinguishable from the one-celled protozoan\r\nanimal, the amoeba. Each swims about freely for a time by means of\r\ntentacle-like arms, the flagellae.\r\n\r\nThese free-moving living particles are known as “swarm cells”. Each\r\nis an individual with a film-like skin separating it from all other\r\nindividuals. That is, the protoplasm of each cell is enclosed within\r\na boundary and in the center of each is a nucleus. These one-celled\r\n“animals” wander about freely for a few days. During this time they may\r\nmate, as individuals. More commonly each loses its flagellae and splits\r\ninto several fragments. Each of these fragments becomes a complete\r\norganism. These mate, with complete fusion of their bodies. The result\r\nis a double plant or animal—depending on whether it is observed by a\r\nbotanist or zoologist—known as a zygote. The fragments are extremely\r\nvoracious little creatures devouring greedily the one-celled plants, or\r\nbacteria, which they encounter.\r\n\r\nWhen the fusion is complete the zygote, in turn, starts to split up\r\ninto single-celled organisms but after a few divisions hundreds of\r\nthese single-celled animals coalesce into a tiny ball, like the seed\r\npod of a plant. In a few days thousands of these spheroids collect into\r\na so-called “plasmodium”. The hitherto individual pseudo-protozoans\r\nmeanwhile have lost their cell walls. The primaeval substance of\r\nmillions is mixed together into a slimy mass full of cell nuclei. This\r\nis an aggregation of “naked protoplasm”. It is hardly to be compared\r\nwith the body of any higher plant or animal where each cell retains\r\nsomething of its individuality, however closely its activities may\r\nbe coordinated with those of its fellows in the same community. The\r\nmass proceeds to behave like a voracious animal. It moves and feeds\r\nas a unit and apparently with a purpose. Within the naked protoplasm\r\nthere is apparently some incomprehensible sense of fellowship which\r\neventually evolves into consciousness and intelligence, developing\r\nnerve and brain on the way upwards. It would be hazardous to say that\r\nthis evolution could have taken no other path.\r\n\r\nFrom the central body great numbers of thread-like filaments are sent\r\nout to penetrate the substance of rotting wood or the surface of a dead\r\nleaf. These threads seem to be like an army’s scouting parties, pushed\r\nahead to locate supplies when advancing troops are living off the\r\ncountry. When a supply is found they are drawn in and the whole slimy\r\norganism acts once more as a coordinated whole.\r\n\r\nThe plasmodium moves forward steadily for about 50 to 60 seconds,\r\npauses for a few moments, and then reverses itself and creeps backward,\r\nbut never quite so far as it previously had gone ahead. Then, after\r\nanother pause, it crawls forward again. Thus there is an overall slow\r\nadvance and at the bottom of life the slime molds lay down the pattern\r\nof progress recapitulated in human societies and civilizations as well\r\nas in the lives of individual men and women. They merit consideration\r\nin the philosophy of history.\r\n\r\nThe advancing mass of raw protoplasm acts like an animal and grows\r\nlike an animal as it ingests food, with constant splitting of the cell\r\nnuclei which it contains. There are vacuoles within the protoplasm in\r\nwhich the food particles are ingested. They then are digested by means\r\nof enzymes (body chemicals), as in higher animals.\r\n\r\nSuch a plasmodium can be taken from its damp habitat and dried. Then\r\nit will roll up into a ball and pass into a resting stage from which\r\nit will revive completely in a few hours when supplied with moisture\r\nagain. The ball may keep its vitality for several years.\r\n\r\nSome species pass as much as a year in the active plasmodium stage, and\r\nsome a few days. At the end of this phase of its existence the mass of\r\nraw protoplasm breaks up into fragments—sometimes as many as a hundred.\r\nThen, as the process is described for one common species “in an hour or\r\ntwo each of these fragments has risen into a pear-shaped body with a\r\nnarrow base, a dark stalk being just apparent through the translucent\r\nwhite substance.” In about six hours the black, hair-like stalk has\r\ngrown to its full length and bears at its top a young “sporangium”\r\nconsisting of a globule of viscous plasma with a diameter about a fifth\r\nthe length of the stalk. This globe is about the size of a mustard\r\nseed and ranges in color from pure white through golden-yellow, light\r\ncrimson, violet, purple and black.\r\n\r\nA pink flush now begins to pervade the sporangium caused by the\r\nformation of branching threads. The nuclei in the plasma still present\r\nthe same appearance as those observed in the streaming plasmodium. In\r\nabout another hour these nuclei show the beginning of division. As this\r\nprocess develops the plasma becomes separated in masses of two spores\r\ncapacity. An hour later the nuclei have divided and the young spores\r\nare forming. Their color rapidly changes. In about the first twenty\r\nhours after the first concentration of the fragments of the plasmodium\r\nthey have matured and present the appearance of minute black pins\r\nstanding in regular order on wood. The ripe fruit, or sporangium, then\r\ndries and breaks.\r\n\r\nOn placing the spore in water its membranous wall slips off and the\r\nnaked contents lie for several hours without apparent change in an\r\nellipsoid form. Constriction then takes place and the ellipsoid splits\r\ninto one to four globular bodies adhering together and exhibiting slow\r\namoeboid movements. Each globular body now develops a flagellum—a long,\r\nwhip-like extension, and the cluster swims away by means of these\r\nflagellae.\r\n\r\nNow the whole life process is ready to be repeated. There are more than\r\n400 species of these slime molds and they are distributed over all the\r\ntemperate and tropic zones. If only the spores and the stalked little\r\nball containing them are considered, the slime mold would be placed\r\nsquarely in the kingdom of plants. But when the protoplasm escapes from\r\nthe spore and starts moving about ingesting bacteria, the behavior is\r\nthat of a one-celled animal. When the cells unite to form a plasmodium\r\nthere is a close likeness to a many-celled animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weird Ways of Birds_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most fantastic forms of animal behavior is that of the\r\nhoney guides, African birds distantly related to the American\r\nwoodpeckers. They “guide” men, baboons and ratels to the nests of wild\r\nhoneybees—supposedly so that these nests will be broken open.\r\n\r\nThroughout the three centuries since the unusual behavior of the bird\r\nwas first reported by a Portuguese missionary it has been the subject\r\nof many fantastic accounts, some of which attribute a far higher degree\r\nof intelligence to the birds than they possibly could possess.\r\n\r\nA long-continued study of this behavior has been made by Dr. Herbert\r\nFriedmann, Smithsonian curator of birds. Dr. Friedmann himself has\r\nobserved at least 23 instances of the habit and has collected much\r\nother well authenticated data from African associates. He describes the\r\nbehavior from his own observations:\r\n\r\n“When the bird is ready to begin guiding it comes to a person and\r\nstarts a repetitive series of churring notes, or it stays where it is\r\nand begins calling these notes and waits for the human to approach it\r\nmore closely. These churring notes are very similar to the sound made\r\nby shaking a partly full, small matchbox rapidly sidewise. If the bird\r\ncomes to the person it flies 15 or 20 feet from him, calling constantly\r\nand fanning its tail.\r\n\r\n“It usually perches on a fairly conspicuous branch, churring rapidly,\r\nfanning its tail, and ruffing its wings so that at times its yellow\r\nshoulder bands are visible.\r\n\r\n“As the person comes to within 15 to 50 feet the bird flies off with a\r\nconspicuous initial downward dip, and then goes off to another tree,\r\nnot necessarily in sight of the follower, in fact more often out of\r\nsight than not. Then it waits there, churring loudly until the follower\r\nagain nears it, when the action is repeated. This goes on until the\r\nvicinity of the bees’ nest is reached. It waits there for the follower\r\nto open the hive and usually until the person has departed with his\r\nloot of honeycomb, when it comes down to the plundered bee’s nest and\r\nbegins to feed on the bits of comb left strewn about. The time during\r\nwhich the bird may wait quietly may vary from a few minutes to well\r\nover an hour and a half.”\r\n\r\nAfrican natives regard the bird as an almost infallible guide to\r\nhoney. They try to attract it by grunting like a ratel or chopping on\r\ntrees to imitate the sound of opening a nest. The habit is apparently\r\ninstinctive; it presumably originated before human beings appeared,\r\nperhaps starting with the ratel or some of its honey-eating ancestors.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the honey bird does not seem interested in the\r\nhoney, per se, or in the grubs of bees found in the nests. It has an\r\ninsatiable appetite for the wax, which it will take wherever it can be\r\nfound. The first account of the bird was of an individual which fed on\r\nthe wax candles of a church. It appears to have a peculiar ability to\r\ndigest wax presumably to extract the nutritive elements contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fantastic Sea Horse_\r\n\r\n\r\nA fish with the head of a Lilliputian horse, the tail of a monkey,\r\nthe shell of a beetle and the pouch of a kangaroo...a creature that\r\nreverses the ordinary course of nature in that “child bearing” is\r\nexclusively a function of the male.... Perhaps in no other animal have\r\nbeen packed so many anomalies as in the little hippocampus, popularly\r\nknown as the “sea horse”.\r\n\r\nThese weird creatures are almost world-wide in their distribution\r\nthrough ocean waters where there are growths of sea vegetation. They\r\nhave provided the models for some of the monsters of human nightmares.\r\nActually they are small, feeble, almost defenseless creatures.\r\n\r\nThe head unquestionably is similar to that of a miniature horse in\r\ngeneral outline. The neck, however, is not a neck at all. Fishes have\r\nno necks and hippocampus is no exception. What looks like a neck is the\r\nupper part of its abdomen, considerably contracted.\r\n\r\nThe body is covered with a jointed, chitinous shell, like many of the\r\ninsects. This peculiarity left early naturalists in doubt as to whether\r\nit actually was a fish or some sort of monstrous water bug. It is,\r\nof course, a true fish with no insect affiliations. The hard shell\r\nmakes it a feeble, inefficient swimmer. It is able, in fact, to swim\r\nat all only because of a large air bladder so delicately adjusted to\r\nthe specific gravity of the animal that if a gas bubble the size of\r\na pinhead is let out by a puncture the sea horse sinks to the bottom.\r\nThere it can only crawl about clumsily until the wound is healed.\r\n\r\nBecause it is so poor a swimmer the hippocampus must have other means\r\nof adjustment to its salt water environment. This is afforded by a\r\nprehensile tail which it can wrap around the stems of water plants.\r\nThis kind of a tail is found among a few mammals, notably the smaller\r\nmonkeys. So far as is known, no other fish has anything of the sort.\r\nThe animal is most frequently observed in a state of rest, its tail\r\nwrapped around a plant and its body standing nearly erect in the water.\r\n\r\nIts food consists of tiny crustaceans and other sea organisms of like\r\nsize. Because of its poor powers of locomotion, it must wait for those\r\nwhich come within reach of its jaws which work with lightning-like\r\nspeed, or for those which will wait accommodatingly for it to come and\r\nget them.\r\n\r\nHippocampus can move its eyes independently of each other, thus looking\r\nbackward and forward at the same time. It would be rather difficult for\r\na predaceous organism to take it by surprise, but on the other hand\r\nit would have little ability to fight back or flee if attacked. Some\r\nspecies, at least, have considerable ability to change color to blend\r\nwith the environment. Bright red, pink or yellow specimens when caught\r\nfade rapidly to normal mottled gray.\r\n\r\nProbably the greatest anomaly of the hippocampus family is its way of\r\nreproducing the species. The male actually “gives birth” to living\r\nyoung. The process, so far as known, is unduplicated in nature.\r\nUnfertilized eggs are laid by the female. She places them, a few at a\r\ntime, into a pouch-like organ on the underside of the male’s body. In\r\nsome fashion still unknown to biologists they are fertilized in the\r\ntransfer. Within this pouch the eggs are incubated and there the young\r\nremain for several days after they are hatched. Then, fully equipped\r\nto take care of themselves, they are expelled into the water. So far\r\nas has been observed, there is no further parental interest in them.\r\nThis male pouch might be considered as filling the double function of\r\nthe womb of a placental mammal and the pouch of a marsupial like the\r\nkangaroo.\r\n\r\nThe sea horse also has the distinction of being one of the species of\r\nfish that “talk”. In recent years “talking fish” have become a matter\r\nof considerable interest to the Navy because of the confusion they\r\ncause in the interpretation of underwater sounds. They give every\r\nindication of talking to each other. They produce loud clicks similar\r\nto the snapping of a finger. These also have been compared to the\r\nclicks of a telegraph. They were especially notable when an animal\r\nwas first placed in the tank and apparently was confused by the new\r\nenvironment. It would cruise back and forth across the container,\r\nstanding upright and its prehensile tail curled over its back,\r\nemitting the characteristic sounds at intervals of from a half to three\r\nquarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nWhen two sea horses were kept in separate jars adjacent to each other\r\nin an experiment it appeared as if they were trying to converse. First\r\none would emit a series of clicks. Then the other would answer. The\r\nsounds are produced by snapping the jaws together. In nature these\r\nprobably are mating calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Seal Migrations_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great annual northward migration of the seals is one of the\r\nmost remarkable phenomena of animal life. It seems to be without\r\norganization and without leadership, yet toward the end of March each\r\nyear the hundreds of thousands of cow seals and pups scattered over\r\nthousands of square miles of water start at about the same time in\r\nthree great groups bound for three specific places. It has been the\r\nsame for centuries, perhaps millenia. Each animal moves at about the\r\nsame rate so that all arrive within a few days of each other. They do\r\nnot move in compact masses, like birds.\r\n\r\nThe American herd of about 1,500,000 is by far the largest of the\r\nthree. It goes straight to the Pribiloff Islands where it goes ashore\r\non two almost barren islands—St. Paul and St. George. The Japanese\r\nherd, numbering about 40,000, makes for Robben Island, off northern\r\nJapan. The Russian herd, now estimated at about 200,000, goes to a few\r\nrocky islands of the Commander archipelago, off Kamchatka.\r\n\r\nThe moving herds consist almost entirely of females and young. The\r\nbulls winter further north, tend to be solitary during the winter, and\r\nprecede the cows to the summer homes. The breeding season lasts for\r\nabout two months. During this time the bull never eats or touches a\r\ndrop of water. He never leaves the land. He arrives sleek and fat from\r\nthe ocean pasture and is able to survive entirely on stored energy.\r\nThis keeps him alive, even when he fights scores of terrible battles\r\nwith younger rivals. Towards the end of summer he naturally is a\r\nsorry-looking creature.\r\n\r\nOne day, actuated by some common impulse, cows and calves depart.\r\nThen the bulls, their arduous labors of race propagation over for ten\r\nmonths, draw back among the rocks and spend two or three days in sound\r\nsleep before returning to the sea to replenish themselves.\r\n\r\nCows have very little reserve energy and must return to the water every\r\ntwo or three days, leaving their nursing pups ashore. On her return\r\nfrom one of these feeding expeditions, a cow goes straight to her own\r\npup among the thousands on the rocky beach. Presumably she locates it\r\nby the odor. Few animals grow more rapidly than the seal pup. Within\r\na few weeks after birth it is almost as large as its mother. This is\r\nan essential provision of nature, for it must have sufficient size\r\nand strength to care for itself in the open sea, once the southward\r\nmigration starts. It is fully the size of the mother when it comes back\r\nthe next year. There is an old idea that seal pups must be taught to\r\nswim. This is denied by government observers at the Pribiloff breeding\r\ngrounds. When thrown into the water for the first time they swim ashore\r\nwithout difficulty. They will not, however, venture into the sea\r\nvoluntarily but must be pushed off the rocks by the mothers.\r\n\r\nSt. George and St. Paul islands are the only two spots under the\r\nAmerican flag, except for certain atomic energy and military\r\ninstallations, which are absolutely barred to visitors without special\r\ngovernment permits. These, as a rule, are given only to scientists\r\nstudying the behavior of the seals. On each island there is an Aleut\r\nvillage whose inhabitants attend to the butchering of the animals\r\neach summer. This is confined entirely to three-year-old males who\r\ncongregate by themselves. The only other killing permitted is by\r\nAleuts along the coast for whom sealing is the traditional means of\r\nlivelihood, but this now is so restricted that the annual toll is very\r\nsmall. The sealing must be done from an open boat, use of firearms is\r\nprohibited, and the Aleuts cannot be under contract to furnish skins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monsters With Buzz Saws_\r\n\r\n\r\n“But if, retaining sense and sight, we could shrink into living atoms\r\nand plunge under water, of what a world of wonder would we form\r\npart. We would find this fairy kingdom peopled with the strangest\r\ncreatures—creatures that swim with their hair, have ruby eyes blazing\r\ndeep in their necks, with telescopic limbs that now are withdrawn\r\nwholly into their bodies and now stretched out to many times their own\r\nlength. Here are some riding at anchor, moored by delicate threads spun\r\nout from their own toes. There are others flashing in glass armor,\r\nbristling with sharp spikes or ornamented with bosses and flowing\r\ncurves; while fastened to a green stem is an animal convulvulus that by\r\nsome invisible power draws a never-ceasing stream of victims into its\r\ngaping cup and tears them to death with hooked jaws deep down in its\r\nown body.”—_The Rotifera_ by C. T. Hudson and P. H. Goose, London, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe rotifers or wheel animalcules are fantastic creatures. They were\r\nfirst seen by the Dutchman Antonius van Leeuwenhoek, credited with\r\nbeing the inventor of the microscope. “On the 25th of August,” he wrote\r\nto the Royal Society of London with which group of savants patronized\r\nby Charles the Second he was in regular correspondence, “I saw in a\r\nleaden gutter on the front of the house for a length of five feet some\r\nrain water had been standing which had a red color. It occurred to me\r\nthat this redness might be caused by red animalcules. I took a drop or\r\ntwo of the water and looked at it under the microscope.”\r\n\r\nHe found a confusion of “red-eyed monsters armed with teeth like those\r\nof the balance wheel of a watch, which appear to be projecting forward\r\ntowards the head. They seem to whirl around with a very considerable\r\nvelocity, by which means a rapid current of water is brought from a\r\ndistance to the mouth of the creature who thereby is supplied with many\r\ninvisible food particles.”\r\n\r\nThis discovery is of considerable significance in scientific history\r\nbecause, more than any of his previous findings, it caused the\r\nAmsterdam spectacle-maker to question the then widely held belief in\r\nthe spontaneous generation of living things.\r\n\r\n“They can,” he wrote the Royal Society in 1774, “continue many months\r\nout of water and be dry as dust, in which condition their shape is\r\nglobular, the bigness exceeds not a grain of sand, and no signs of life\r\nappear. Notwithstanding, being put in water, the globule turns itself\r\nabout, lengthens by slow degrees, becomes in the form of a lively\r\nmaggot, and most commonly in a few minutes afterwards puts out its\r\nwheels and sweeps the water in search of food. But sometimes it may\r\nremain a long time in the maggot form and not show its wheels at all.”\r\n\r\nSuch tiny organisms capable of such long periods of suspended\r\nanimation, Leeuwenhoek held, could be blown by the wind for long\r\ndistances. Thus the sudden appearance of living animals in supposedly\r\nlifeless water did not indicate they had been born or created there.\r\n\r\nThe microscope designer had found, moreover, an hitherto unknown race,\r\ngiants of the microscopic world and among the most fantastic of all\r\nanimals—the rotifers.\r\n\r\nThese usually invisible animals with buzz-saws on their heads—the\r\nlargest not more than a quarter-inch long and the majority less than\r\na twentieth—seem to have gone further beyond life’s normally accepted\r\nfrontiers than any other animals. One species lives comfortably in\r\nhot springs where temperatures go above 120 Fahrenheit. Others can be\r\nfrozen in solid cakes of ice for weeks and show no ill effects. Sudden\r\nchanges in temperature, however, often are fatal. On tops of Antarctic\r\nmountains projecting out of ice two miles thick, the little rotifers\r\nare found among sparse growths of lichens, the only animal life which\r\napproaches closely to the South Pole on land. There is no reason why\r\nthey should not thrive in the hardly less hospitable mountains of Mars.\r\nThey might have been carried there in light propelled earthdust.\r\n\r\nThe majority are fresh-water creatures. A few live in damp moss and\r\na few species have obtained a foothold in the sea. Some live in\r\nimmense colonies, permanently attached to stones. Some are free-living\r\nindividualists who crawl like leeches, or swim rapidly. Some are\r\nparasites in the cells of water plants or in the gills of fresh\r\nwater crabs. Others cling to floating plants or to water animals,\r\nto be carried from place to place. One highly social group lives in\r\nfree-moving communities of forty or more individuals, attached to each\r\nother by their tail ends and radiating from a common center like wheel\r\nspokes. The usual color is reddish and most rotifers have one or more\r\nglittering red eyes. In a few cases these eyes are inside the bodies of\r\ntransparent species.\r\n\r\nDespite their minuteness, these predatory giants of the world invisible\r\nare highly developed animals. Each has a body divided, like that of a\r\nmammal, into three major segments—head, trunk, and extremities. In some\r\nthe skin is hardened into an armor-like covering. Some have a panoply\r\nof defensive spines and bristles.\r\n\r\nInside the skin is a cavity full of watery fluid—it contains no\r\ncorpuscles like blood—in which float the more important vital organs.\r\nIn most animals there is tissue of some sort in which nerves, muscles,\r\nand glands are imbedded. In rotifers, however, there is very little of\r\nthis connective tissue. Under a microscope one generally can see with\r\nsome clearness each individual cell. These cells can be counted, for at\r\nthe most there are only a few thousands, compared to the millions of\r\nmillions that make up the bodies of larger animals. The muscles are not\r\nbanded together, but consist of isolated strands whose job is to pull\r\nthe head inside the armored trunk when faced with any threat, and to\r\nbend the body in various directions.\r\n\r\nAll rotifers have two organs unique to their race. First is the “buzz\r\nsaw”. This is a crown of tentacles, quite similar in appearance under\r\nlow magnification to a circular saw, which is constantly whirling.\r\nIts purpose is to create eddies in the water which will bring food\r\nparticles to the mouth, a funnel-shaped opening on top of the head. In\r\nfree-living species the saw may have some function as a propeller.\r\n\r\nSecond is the mastax, or “chewing stomach”. Every rotifer has two\r\nstomachs, one for masticating and one for digesting. The mouth opens\r\ndirectly into the first. It is provided with two horny, serrated jaws\r\nwhich crush toward each other and tear to bits the minute animals\r\nand plants which are the creature’s food. The jaws are provided with\r\nseveral hard parts, adapted for biting, crushing, holding, and tearing.\r\n\r\nIn the permanently anchored rotifers the rear of the body is prolonged\r\ninto a stalk from the end of which a cement-like substance is secreted.\r\nThis permanently attaches the animal to something, usually a stone.\r\nIn some of the free-living forms the “foot” is replaced by one to\r\ntwelve “leaping spines” by means of which the owner can spring suddenly\r\nforward several times its own length to capture an unsuspecting victim.\r\nThis is most often some floating one-celled creature of the water-drop\r\njungle, such as a protozoan elephant.\r\n\r\nThe male rotifer is usually much smaller than the female—sometimes\r\nnothing more than an appendage she carries about with her. The\r\nfantastic worlds of all sorts of rotifers are predominantly feminine\r\nworlds. For some species, in fact, males never have been found, but\r\nthere is little doubt that they exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Two-Headed Snakes Aren’t Rare_\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo-headed snakes probably are quite common. About 200 cases have been\r\nreported. Dr. Bert Cunningham of Duke University, who has studied\r\nseveral living specimens, has this to report about such snakes: “The\r\nheads play together, fight over a morsel of food even though it will\r\ngo into the same stomach through either mouth, attempt to swallow one\r\nanother, and sometimes fight fatal duels. Each head has a brain of its\r\nown. Few grow to any size. In this case two heads are not better than\r\none, especially when they disagree when a second means escape or death.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fantastic Sea Creatures_\r\n\r\n\r\nCoral-forested waters around the Gilbert and Mariana Islands in the\r\nPacific are yielding some of the most fantastic sea creatures known to\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nExtensive collections have been made since the war by Dr. Leonard P.\r\nSchultz, Smithsonian curator of fishes. Notable in the collections\r\nare snake, worm and moray eels, all bottom dwellers in tropical\r\nwaters. Snake eels are, as the name indicates, superficially almost\r\nindistinguishable from serpents. On their tails they have hard points\r\nwhich are used as drills. They burrow straight downward in the bottom\r\nsand, tails first, until only the heads protrude above the surface. The\r\nworm eels belong to the same general group but are much smaller and\r\nslenderer—about the diameter of a lead pencil and reaching lengths up\r\nto two feet. Larger worm eels have been reported.\r\n\r\nBoth these groups consist of relatively timid, inoffensive creatures.\r\nFar different are the moray eels, members of a closely related family.\r\nThey are as much as ten feet long, have razor-like teeth, and are\r\ndescribed by Dr. Schultz as about the most vicious creatures in the\r\nsea. In disposition they probably are worse than the worst sharks and\r\neasily can bite through a man’s hand.\r\n\r\nProbably the most poisonous creature in the collection is a variety of\r\nsting ray, weighing about 200 pounds, which was speared at the bottom\r\nof 20 feet of water. This animal, like all stingarees, has a tail armed\r\nwith long, poisonous barbs. The venom could be lethal to a man. After\r\nit was speared, the ray remained very much alive and the problem of\r\nbringing it to the surface was difficult. This finally was accomplished\r\nby two of Dr. Schultz' collaborators. First one would dive, grasp the\r\nhandle of the spear, and lift the creature a few feet, always holding\r\nit far enough away to be clear of the barbs. After the first man became\r\nexhausted, the other would relieve him while he came up for air. Thus\r\nthe specimen finally was gotten on board through a series of relays.\r\n\r\nCuriosities of the collection are the cardinal fishes—brilliant red,\r\nvery active, and including some of the smallest marine fishes. A few\r\nspecies attain full growth at about three-fourths of an inch. These are\r\nthe most notable of the “mouth breeders.” The female lays the eggs and\r\nthe male carries them in his mouth until they hatch. Inch-long males\r\nsometimes carry as many as 400 eggs, nearly all of which hatch.\r\n\r\nOther curiosities are the pipe fishes, hard-shelled animals which look\r\nlike bits of small, segmented pipe. They range from two inches to a\r\nfoot long and are related to the more familiar sea horses of temperate\r\nwaters. They are sluggish burrowers in coral reefs. As among sea\r\nhorses, the male gives birth to the young. The eggs are deposited in\r\npouches on the male’s belly where they are carried until they hatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Varieties of Raven Language_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile “nevermore” apparently is not in the vocabulary of the raven this\r\nbig black bird of the wilder parts of the country has a considerable\r\nvariety of sounds nearly as ominous.\r\n\r\nRaven “language” has been intensively studied by the noted\r\nornithologist, Dr. Arthur Cleveland Bent. Citing various bird\r\nobservers, he lists the following calls:\r\n\r\nA distinct, hollow, sepulchral laugh, haw-haw-haw-haw, which may be\r\nheard at almost any time.\r\n\r\nA series of “crawks” sounded while on the wing, interspersed with a\r\nmusical note that sounds like ge-lick-ge-lee.\r\n\r\nA strange call like thing-thung-thung which is similar to the mellow\r\ntwang of a tuning fork.\r\n\r\nAnother expression has a metallic, liquid-like quality similar to the\r\nsong of the red-winged blackbird, although greatly magnified in volume.\r\n\r\nRavens have a large range of notes from the melancholy croaks with\r\nwhich they chiefly are associated to striking imitations of other\r\nbirds, such as geese and gulls. One of these birds will talk to itself\r\nfor hours with a curious gargling sound. He becomes so absorbed in his\r\nown conversation that it often is not difficult to steal up on him\r\nduring such a soliloquy.\r\n\r\n“The raven,” Dr. Bent observes, “is one of our most sagacious\r\nbirds—crafty, resourceful, adaptable, and quick to profit by\r\nexperience. Throughout most of its range it is exceeding shy and wary.\r\nIt is almost impossible to get within gunshot of one in the open. Yet\r\nit knows full well where and when it is safe. About northern villages,\r\nwhere it is appreciated as a scavenger and seldom molested, it is as\r\ntame as any barnyard bird.” This is especially true in Greenland where\r\nravens infest American air bases.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the north the raven frequents the seacoast and villages,\r\nfrom Pennsylvania southward it is entirely a mountain bird, usually\r\nliving above 3,000 feet. From these heights the birds sometimes descend\r\nto the valleys, or even the islands along the coast, to forage among\r\nthe colonies of sea birds. Most of them prefer to dwell among rocks and\r\nresort to perpendicular cliffs and to escarpments thrust above forests\r\non the flanks of mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms With Hypodermic Needles_\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite their microscopic size, nematodes (soil worms), are highly\r\norganized animals. They have muscles, quite specialized organs for\r\nfeeding, a digestive system, a nervous system with a brain, and a\r\nwell-developed reproductive system. Sexes are clearly differentiated.\r\nThe creatures have evolved a long way from the primeval worm.\r\n\r\nEggs may be deposited in the soil, or in the plant on which the\r\nnematode feeds. In these eggs the immature forms, the larvae, develop\r\nand eventually hatch. If appropriate plants are available, they may\r\nbegin to feed immediately. They develop through several distinct\r\nstages. At the end of each of these cycles a moult occurs.\r\n\r\nMany of the forms which have been studied closely have a minimum life\r\ncycle, from egg to egg-laying female, of several days to several weeks.\r\nThe maximum duration of life, however, may be much longer, since sexual\r\nmaturity is not reached until the nematode begins to feed on the living\r\nplant. Up to this time it remains in the larval stage and lives on a\r\nreserve food supply originally derived from the egg. The time this\r\nreserve lasts depends on circumstances. In damp, warm soil the nematode\r\nwill be very active and use it up in a few weeks. In cool or dry soil\r\nthe supply lasts much longer, and can extend to many years.\r\n\r\nThe little worm’s life is a perpetual struggle for existence. It\r\nhas many enemies in the soil—insects, fungi, and other free-living\r\nnematodes. Certain of the soil fungi have “traps” especially designed\r\nto catch nematodes. Some of these are shaped like loops which are\r\npulled tight as the worm starts to crawl through. Others are sticky\r\nsurfaces on which the victims are captured, like flies on flypaper. In\r\neither case, the fungus grows into the body of the worm and kills it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the nematode population is never in any great danger\r\nof extermination. A single female root knot nematode will produce\r\nabout 300 eggs in a couple of weeks. Allowing four weeks for a\r\ngeneration, and assuming half the offspring are females, this implies\r\na theoretically possible fifty trillion individuals at the end of the\r\nfour generations of a single summer.\r\n\r\nPractically all roots are attacked by some kind of nematode, but many\r\nspecies appear to specialize on one type of plant and will not touch a\r\ndifferent variety, even if no other food is available. Plants immune\r\nto one species may be highly susceptible to some other. A few kinds\r\nof these worms, however, appear to eat almost anything they can find\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\nAll the root-eaters have a feeding organ which is much like a\r\nhypodermic needle. This is pushed into the tissue and, it is believed,\r\na digestive juice of some sort is injected. This liquifies and\r\npartially digests the food. Then the nematode sucks it through the\r\nneedle into its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the nematodes, a parasite of whales, can reach a length\r\nof 27 feet. The smallest, a marine form, is a little more than a\r\nthree-thousandth of an inch long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fatal Black Widow Spider_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe venom of the dreaded Black Widow spider is approximately fifteen\r\ntimes more potent than that of the rattlesnake. The comparison has been\r\nestablished by determining the amounts of rattlesnake and spider venom\r\nnecessary to kill rats of the same weight. The extreme toxicity of the\r\nspider becomes of considerable significance since it has been reported\r\nfrom every state in the Union and may be increasing in numbers on the\r\nedges of cities. Probability of being bitten, however, is slight. The\r\nblack widow is a timid creature, except towards her natural prey. At\r\nthe first molestation of her web she retreats quickly to her central\r\nnest and does not venture out again for hours. She makes no attempt\r\nat defense, to say nothing of aggression. Her reputation is so bad,\r\nhowever, that in some cases pickers have refused to work in vineyards\r\nwhich she infested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plants That are Animated_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities often sold in American stores are so-called\r\n“air plants”—plants that will grow on air alone without sunshine or\r\nwater. This is true, after a fashion. The “plants” actually are dried\r\nskeletons of marine animals. They belong to the group which includes\r\nthe jellyfish, sea anemones and corals. Their skeletons have a striking\r\nresemblance to plants.\r\n\r\nThe species most commonly sold is sea moss or Neptune’s fern, an animal\r\nabundant in the North Atlantic, especially in the English channel and\r\nthe Gulf of Maine. A closely related species, the “squirrel’s tail,” is\r\nabundant in the eastern Pacific where its silvery colonies often are\r\nwashed ashore by storms. Dry beach material of these colonies is easily\r\ncollected, dyed and sold as Christmas decorations.\r\n\r\n“These are colonial forms consisting of thousands of individual\r\nanimals,” according to the Chicago Museum of Natural History. “Colonies\r\nof two species of sea squirrel may be twelve inches or more long.\r\nThose of some species may be several feet in length. Usually they are\r\nattached to rocks or other substrata by a rootlike base, from which\r\nspring the delicate branched stems bearing hundreds of minute polyps.\r\n\r\n“Most of these are hydranths (feeding polyps) that capture microscopic\r\norganisms. The reproductive polyps are less common, usually larger, and\r\ndifferent in shape. The common stem is made up of external non-cellular\r\nmaterial, mostly yellowish or brown in color.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tomato—Cinderella of Vegetables_\r\n\r\n\r\nA remarkable chapter in the history of agriculture is the story of\r\nthe tomato which now constitutes one of this country’s major crops.\r\nIt appears to have first been used as a food by the Aztecs. It was\r\nintroduced into Spain early in the 16th century and a century later\r\nwas grown widely in England as an ornamental plant. Not until the next\r\ncentury, however, did it have any standing as a food. It was known as\r\nthe “love apple” and was considered mildly poisonous. Folks ate one now\r\nand then on “dares.”\r\n\r\nThen it caught on as a food in Italy and by the start of the 19th\r\ncentury was being grown on a field scale. So far as known, it was\r\nabsent from the gardens of Colonial America, unless as a rare\r\nornamental plant. Not until the middle of the 19th century was it\r\nreintroduced to its native western hemisphere as a food crop. For a\r\nlong time it acquired no great popularity. A few vines in the family\r\ngarden were considered enough, since there was no tomato market.\r\n\r\nA U. S. Department of Agriculture report calls the tomato “the prodigy\r\nof the vegetable world.” Its present success is due in large part to\r\nthe discovery of vitamins. Although used as a food for little more than\r\na century it now is almost as widely distributed as wheat, a food plant\r\nwhich has been cultivated for at least 5,000 years.\r\n\r\nToday the tomato crop covers about a half million acres in the U. S.\r\nalone. This crop consists of more than 20,000,000 bushels of fresh\r\ntomatoes and more than 300,000 tons of canned products. There are now\r\nabout 150 known varieties, adapted to all sorts of purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Holiest Place on Earth_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summit of Adam’s Peak in south-central Ceylon, wrapped perpetually\r\nin priestly robes of grey clouds, is one of the holy places of the\r\nearth. There, through many centuries, the prayers of millions belonging\r\nto warring creeds have worn thin the curtain between the effable and\r\nthe ineffable. It is a shrine of four of the world’s great religions.\r\nIn the rock is a depression that looks like a giant’s footprint. Hindus\r\nbelieve it was made by snake-haired Siva, the destroyer. Moslems say\r\nit is the footprint of the first man, Adam, who was exiled to this\r\nmountaintop after he was thrown out of Paradise. Buddhists believe that\r\nit could have been made only by the great Gautama. Nestorian Christians\r\nmaintain that it is a relic of the disciple Thomas, who brought the\r\ngospel of Christ into the East. To this spot, braving the road through\r\nleech-infested forests below and the perilous ascent along gale-swept\r\nledges, have come generation after generation of devout pilgrims\r\nto voice a common prayer in different tongues through different\r\nintermediaries.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim, standing by the footprint of Adam, looks down upon the\r\nforest-covered hills to the eastward. Over all the land spreads the\r\ngrey shadow of the supernatural. Below him is one of the most imposing\r\nspectacles on earth—the middle slopes scarlet with the blossoms\r\nof dense forests of gigantic rhododendrons, the deep-blue patches\r\nof mountain lakes, and canyons which no human has entered—their\r\nmysterious depths hidden by wind-tossed fog. Great waterfalls roar over\r\nvine-covered cliffs. Strange sounds arise from jungles of white-stemmed\r\npalms. It is a wild land of ghosts and demons watched over by the holy\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nIn this unearthly country native legend from ancient days has placed,\r\nmost appropriately, the death valley of the elephants. There, in a\r\npleasant hollow beside a lake of clear water—reached only by a narrow\r\npass with high walled precipices on either side—these animals make\r\ntheir way from all over the island when they feel the chill drowsiness\r\nof approaching death. It has been an interminable procession of the\r\ndoomed since time began. To the stricken old elephant, the coming of\r\ndeath brings an irresistible nostalgia which draws his faltering\r\nfeet homeward to this mist-shrouded valley piled high with the white\r\nbones of his ancestors. It is his haven of rest from the weariness and\r\ndisillusion of living.\r\n\r\nThe belief has deep roots in the ancient folk-lore of Ceylon. It has\r\nspread all over the East. It is embodied in the Arabian Nights. No man\r\never has entered this vale of death since Sinbad the Sailor, who was\r\ncarried there in the trunk of a huge elephant after he had been knocked\r\nsenseless when the tree in which he was hiding was uprooted by a herd\r\nof the animals. Sinbad at last found himself in this valley piled high\r\nwith bones and knew that he was in the long-sought death place of the\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\nAnother Ceylon elephant cemetery is concealed in a dense forest near\r\nthe ancient sacred city of Anardhupara. It is so well hidden that no\r\nman knows its exact location, although all know that it exists. Unless\r\nthere are such cemeteries, the natives ask, what becomes of the remains\r\nof dead elephants?\r\n\r\nThe death of the jungle elephant remains a fantastic mystery. No very\r\nserious efforts have been made to provide a solution. Remains of these\r\ncreatures that have died natural deaths seldom have been found, either\r\nin Asia or Africa. Yet obviously the great beasts are mortal, subject\r\nto various fatal ailments and to the inevitable decay of age. Evidently\r\nwhen one of them feels death approaching it retires to a place of the\r\ndead where it quietly breathes its last and adds its bones to those\r\nof the vast multitudes of its race that have gone before it into the\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe belief is so strong that there has been a persistent search for\r\nthese elephant Golgothas for the past century. Such a discovery,\r\nespecially in Africa, probably would mean inestimable wealth in ivory.\r\nBut, except for one or two questionable instances cited below, nobody\r\never has found such a place. Natives sometimes claim to know an\r\napproximate location from tradition, although they never have seen it.\r\n\r\nZoologists naturally frown upon the idea because of its very weirdness.\r\nThey explain that the remains of very few tropical animals ever are\r\nfound and that the elephant, for all its bulk, need be considered no\r\ngreat exception. Vultures, jackals, hyenas and other carrion eaters\r\nsoon would tear the flesh from the bones. Insects would bear away the\r\nfragments they left. Jungle vegetation rapidly would cover and hide the\r\nnaked skeleton.\r\n\r\nSome credence is given to the native belief by Lieut. Col. Gordon\r\nCasserly of the British army. A persistent elephant hunter during years\r\nof service in India, he never came upon the carcass or bones of one\r\nof these animals which had met a natural death. “The idea of a vast\r\ndeath place of these modern mammoths hidden in the remote recesses of\r\nthe Himalayas,” he states, “did not seem a far-fetched one to me when\r\nI lived in the shadow of those mighty mountains and heard at night the\r\ngreat elephant troops pass by the little outpost that I commanded on\r\nthe frontier of Bhutan, as they clamber up towards the snow-clad peaks\r\nfrom the forest below.”\r\n\r\nThe British elephant hunter W. D. M. Bell once thought he had found\r\none of East Africa’s elephant cemeteries in the country north of Lake\r\nRudolph. He had followed an elephant path to a grassy plateau strewn\r\nwith skulls and other elephant bones, some partially buried. None of\r\nthe remains, however, were recent. Bell tasted the green water of a\r\nnearby pool and found it bitter with natron. The indications were that\r\nlarge numbers of elephants had been driven to this pool to drink during\r\na time of drought and had been poisoned by the water.\r\n\r\nMaj. P. H. G. Powell-Cotton tells of finding another spot strewn\r\nwith bones in the same general region which might answer the\r\nspecification for an “elephant graveyard.” “Here I was surprised,”\r\nhe reported, “to find the whole countryside scattered with remains,\r\nthe fitful sun lighting up glistening bones in every direction. In\r\nall my journeyings through elephant country I do not think I have\r\never come across before a skeleton of one of these beasts for whose\r\ndeath the guides could not account. My guide called this place\r\n‘The-place-where-the-elephants-come-to-die’ and assured me that when\r\nthe elephants fell sick they would come deliberately for long distances\r\nto lay their bones in this spot. I had heard of these cemeteries from\r\nSwahili traders who told me they had occasionally found more ivory\r\nthan they could carry. The place was well known to the Turkana, who\r\nregularly visited it to carry off the tusks.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vanishing Golden Carpet_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rarest plant in North America, found only four times by botanists,\r\nis a ground-hugging desert flower—the gold carpet. The plant appears,\r\non rare occasions, in California’s Death Valley. Its appearance is\r\nthat of a rosette of yellow leaves, sometimes as much as ten inches in\r\ndiameter, lying flat on the ground. From this rosette arise innumerable\r\ntiny golden yellow blossoms, so that the whole seems like a patch of\r\ngolden carpet in the brown desert. The reason for its rare occurrence\r\nis that its seeds can germinate only after a good rain. Such rains are\r\nrare in its habitat.\r\n\r\nThe plants must spring up within a few days. Ordinarily, even then,\r\nthey die with the increasing drought before blossoming—thus forming no\r\nseeds. In order for them to produce the seeds for another generation\r\nthere must be another rain following shortly upon the first.\r\n\r\nThe seeds become buried in the desert soil and, in the course of\r\nevolution, have developed the capacity of suspended animation over a\r\nnumber of years. In the old days, it is probable, these seeds retained\r\ntheir fertility only for a single season. Now there may be several\r\nyears between rains sufficient to spur them to germination, and even\r\nlonger periods between double rains which will enable them to form\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe strange little plant first was discovered in 1891. There were only\r\ntwo specimens and search failed to reveal any more. Two years later,\r\nhowever, at about the same place another single plant was reported. No\r\nothers were revealed by an intensive search through the entire area.\r\n\r\nIn 1931 and 1932 Dr. Frederick V. Coville of the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture and French Gilman, a California botanist, again made an\r\nintensive search but could not find a single plant. They came to the\r\nerroneous conclusion that the plant might be native to the mountains,\r\nfrom which occasional seeds were washed down after heavy rains. A\r\nfew years later Mr. Gilman again took up the search and succeeded in\r\nlocating the plant in four places. He found 14 individuals altogether\r\nand watched their growth carefully. Only three became large enough\r\nto flower and produce seed. The others dried up and died when they\r\nhad only a few leaves and no branches. Later, however, Gilman found\r\nmany specimens of the gold carpet scattered over low hills in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nThese little hills all were whitish in color. This led to the idea that\r\nthe chemical composition of the soil might have something to do with\r\nthe appearance of the plants. Analysis, however, showed there was no\r\nbasis for this assumption.\r\n\r\nIn the distant past, the gold carpet may have been a very abundant\r\nplant, germinating and flowering annually in a reasonably moist\r\nclimate. Probably a few individuals developed the capacity of producing\r\nseed which would remain fertile over a lapse of years. When the climate\r\nchanged these had a decided advantage over their fellows.\r\n\r\nApparently the gold carpet is a plant in the process of extinction.\r\nThe continued existence of the species depends on the dormancy of\r\na sufficient number of seeds to carry it over unfavorable years of\r\ninadequate, or inappropriately timed second rains. If Death Valley\r\nbecomes drier and drier and years with suitable double rains become\r\nmore and more infrequent the vitality of the seeds in the soil\r\neventually will be insufficient to span the long periods when no seeds\r\nare produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evolution of the Bird_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a long call from the birds with teeth that hovered over the\r\nstrange world of the dying dinosaurs 150,000,000 odd years ago to the\r\nchorus of sweet singers whose music opens sleepy eyes on May mornings\r\nof the present. The long and devious road can be traced from the\r\ngrotesque archaeopteryx and archaeornis—nightmare-like and long extinct\r\nflying creatures of the dawn—to the living wren and blackbird. But\r\nhowever complicated, the family tree of birds is simple compared to\r\nthat of the reptiles or the mammals, since avian evolution has been\r\nconfined within narrower lines.\r\n\r\nUp to the time that the monster reptiles were beginning to disappear,\r\nit seems probable that all birds had teeth. Gradually, they disappeared\r\nas the group advanced into the dawn age of present life forms. First\r\nwere the ancestral birds—the archaeornithes. They were essentially\r\nwinged reptiles. Following them came the toothed true birds of the New\r\nWorld, known from very fragmentary fossil records. They included the\r\nhesperornis, the hageria and the ichthyornis. Then, representing a\r\nlong advance, came creatures of the ostrich family, probably the most\r\nprimitive of living birds. They are true birds but have not reached\r\nthe typical modern pattern. At the top of the family tree, the highest\r\nbranch of bird evolution, is the great sub-order of song birds. It\r\nincludes fifty families ranging from the larks to the finches and\r\nbuntings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Speed Ace of the Air_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe swiftest bird flight ever recorded accurately is in the\r\nneighborhood of 175 miles an hour. Ordinary, unhurried flight averages\r\nfrom twenty to forty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe fastest flyer, according to official records, is the California\r\nduck hawk whose speed was measured with a stop watch from an airplane.\r\nEagles apparently are much slower.\r\n\r\nAmong the more reliable bird flight speed measurements are those of\r\nherons, hawks, horned larks, ravens and shrikes. Rates range from 22 to\r\n28 miles an hour. Flight in all these cases was normal and unhurried.\r\nOther speeds reported by the Smithsonian are: crows, 31 to 45 miles an\r\nhour; starlings, 38 to 49 miles; geese, 42 to 55 miles; ducks, 44 to 59\r\nmiles; falcons, 40 to 48 miles.\r\n\r\nWhen frightened, most birds probably can nearly double their normal\r\nrate, but they cannot keep it up very long. When cruising about in\r\nsearch for food they fly so as not to waste their strength. This is\r\nparticularly true on the great annual migrations.\r\n\r\nConsidering ten hours as a fair day’s flying time over land, the\r\nmeasured speeds would carry crows from 310 to 450 miles between sunrise\r\nand sunset and ducks and geese from 420 to 590 miles. Considering\r\nthat they fly in straight lines, this means that they make very good\r\ntime from point to point. It is highly probable, however, that most\r\nmigrating birds proceed in a leisurely manner and that after a flight\r\nof a few hours they pause to feed and rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Remarkable Instincts of the Silk Worm_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silk worm’s brain has an instinct center contained in a speck of\r\nnerve cells with a mass of less than a millionth of an ounce. This\r\ncenter is a microscopic so-called “mushroom body”, found in both sides,\r\nor hemispheres, of the brain. The discovery, with possible far-reaching\r\nphilosophical implications, came out of some of the most delicate\r\nconceivable microsurgery in which the area was destroyed almost cell by\r\ncell by means of an invisibly fine electric needle.\r\n\r\nDoctors Carol Williams and William Van der Kloot of Harvard have made\r\nminute studies of an American silk worm, the cecropia (common along\r\nthe Atlantic coast), which spins as strong and delicate threads as the\r\nJapanese or Italian domesticated silk worms. The cocoon is a marvel of\r\napparent ingenuity, made of a single thread almost a mile long. It is\r\nmade in three layers, roughly after the design of a thermos bottle. The\r\nouter layer is a tightly woven, waterproof silk bag. Inside this is a\r\nlayer of loosely spun material which serves as an insulating layer.\r\nThe third layer, woven around the body of the worm itself, is a bag\r\nof exceedingly fine, soft silk. Through each layer a “hatchway” is\r\nprovided directly in front of the creature’s head. These must be placed\r\none in front of the other with mathematical exactitude. Through them\r\nthe self imprisoned animal must escape when the time comes, and the\r\nslightest error probably would make it a prisoner forever in a coffin\r\nof its own creation.\r\n\r\nInside the cocoon the worm remains, adequately protected from cold and\r\ndamp, for nine months. It emerges as a winged moth, whose sole function\r\nin life apparently is to lay eggs to produce more silkworms.\r\n\r\nSpinning such a cocoon with its three quite different layers requires\r\nextreme precision of movement. Nature has not allowed for any possible\r\nvariations. Yet the masterpiece obviously is not the result of any\r\nthinking, education or practice. The little worm’s life span, for\r\none thing, would not allow for any training. Every movement must be\r\ninstinctive and presumably unconscious, directed by the same part of\r\nthe nervous system into whose structure the pattern has been built by\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe house building must start at precisely the right time. Until that\r\ntime, according to the Harvard physiologists, the responsible area\r\nof the brain is held in restraint by a hormone secreted from two\r\ntiny glands in the head. At the foreordained instant this inhibiting\r\nsecretion ceases and the mushroom body can go into action. The spinning\r\ncan be started at any time, however, by destroying the glands.\r\n\r\nWilliams and Van der Kloot tried effects of two gasses, carbon dioxide\r\nand carbon monoxide. Both acted as potent brain depressants, but in\r\nquite different ways. The first eliminated the spinning behavior\r\nentirely and permanently. The worms wandered about aimlessly,\r\napparently trying in vain to remember what some overwhelming internal\r\ndrive was pushing them to do. The automobile exhaust gas, carbon\r\nmonoxide, fatal to humans but without any serious lasting effects on\r\ninvertebrates because of the lack of the red cells in the blood with\r\nwhich it combines in higher animals, caused them to spin a worthless\r\nand meaningless flat layer of silk as long as the effect continued.\r\nWhen this ended the worm started to spin what remained of the mile-long\r\nthread in the customary pattern, starting from the point it normally\r\nwould have reached had it not been gassed.\r\n\r\nThe biologists then resorted to their unbelievably delicate surgery.\r\nThey proceeded to destroy the silk worm brain a few score cells\r\nat a time. The brain contains hundreds of thousands of cells. The\r\ndestruction had no effect on the spinning behavior until they reached\r\nthe mushroom body. When a few cells of this area were killed by\r\nthe electric current the worm no longer could spin a cocoon but\r\ncontinued to wind and weave its silken thread into three flat sheets,\r\ncorresponding to the three normal capsules. The weaving continued with\r\nthe destruction of a few more cells, but only in a single sheet. When\r\na few more were destroyed the entire cocoon-making behavior came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThus, Doctors Williams and Van der Kloot concluded, they had located a\r\nphysical unit of behavior. Within it was capsuled the whole “memory” of\r\nthe silk worm race with respect to spinning. More than a century ago\r\nthis mushroom body was discovered by the French physiologist Dujardin,\r\nwho called it the “seat of instinct.” At that time this was only a wild\r\nspeculation on his part, without any supporting facts whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe instinct center is found in the brains of all insects in whom\r\ngroup instinctive behavior has manifestation. In the honeybee worker,\r\nintellectual giant of the insect world, it reaches its greatest size.\r\nIn drones and queens, who do not display much behavior of any sort, the\r\narea of the brain is quite small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Strange World of the Sea_\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the tossing surface of southern seas is an inferno-like realm of\r\neverlasting darkness, inhabited by multitudes of strange animals which\r\nexist almost altogether by the laws of beak and fang. Some of them are\r\ngrotesque beyond the reaches of a nightmare.\r\n\r\nCountless generations ago their ancestors, driven by hunger and\r\ncompetition, abandoned the familiar sun-lit world for the perpetual\r\nnight of the abysmal depths. Then with each family, it was a case of\r\nsurvival of the fittest and variation of form and structure to fit the\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nHere is the stark struggle for survival with the mask of sunlight,\r\ngreen fields and flowers discarded. It is not different in kind but in\r\ndegree from the struggle that goes on continually between living things\r\nat the surface of the ocean and on the land. Down there all must eat\r\nflesh. There is no plant life intermediary between beast and beast.\r\nPlants cannot grow below the light line of the sea depths.\r\n\r\nOut of this fierce war for existence have come creatures mostly\r\nconspicuous for their defensive and offensive equipment. Some of the\r\nfish seem to have become little more than enormous mouths with rows\r\nof long, razor-like teeth with which they seize and kill. The bodies\r\nattached to these mouths are small and slender. Such a creature is\r\nmostly head and the head is mostly mouth. Nearly all the fish carry\r\nlight organs of some kind near the mouth with which other animals are\r\nprobably attracted within grabbing distance.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest collections of deep sea animals was assembled a few\r\nyears ago near the Puerto Rico Deep, the deepest part of the Atlantic\r\nOcean, by a Smithsonian Institution expedition led by Dr. Paul Bartsch.\r\nThis collection constituted a fair representation of the sea life at\r\ndepths of about 3200 feet, nearly 2500 feet below the farthest reaches\r\nof the sun’s rays. There were shrimps with long, sharp claws which fold\r\nup after the fashion of an old-fashioned straight razor. Any small\r\ncreature which came within striking distance of such a razor probably\r\nwould be an immediate victim. There were strange mollusks with shells\r\nlike corkscrews and eels like darning needles with long, sharp beaks.\r\n\r\nAmong the most fantastic was the needle-fish. It jaws are prolonged\r\ninto extraordinarily slender points, like fine needles, so that the\r\nhead is nearly as long as the rest of the body—that is, about six\r\ninches. This fish was lured to the net by an electric light.\r\n\r\nA group of flat fish, or flounders, was obtained, all of which have two\r\neyes on one side of the head and none on the other. Instead of right\r\neye and left eye there is upper eye and lower eye.\r\n\r\nOther strange forms in the collection:\r\n\r\nThe hunchback fish, a creature whose strangely shaped body suggests its\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe lance fish with long, backward-reaching spines suggestive of lances\r\njust behind the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe forceps fish, one of the most aberrant of all with its greatly\r\nextended, forceps-like jaws. There is apparently but a single genus and\r\nspecies in existence.\r\n\r\nThe family of snout fish with snouts almost as long as the rest of the\r\nbody. At the end of the snout is a mouth.\r\n\r\nAnother strange creature taken out of the depths by this expedition was\r\nJohnsonia eriomma—the “big eye fish.” Each of its two eyes is about a\r\nfifth as long as the diameter of its body. A man’s eye, in the same\r\nratio, would be about a foot long and protrude about eight inches from\r\nits socket. It also has two false eyes on its sides, near the tail.\r\nThey are of the same size and approximately the same pattern as the\r\ntrue eyes. They probably are indistinguishable from them by other fish.\r\nThey are, however, only color spots and have no visual function. They\r\nconstitute a feature hitherto unknown in the fish world. The purpose\r\nof the false eyes is unknown, unless they are intended to deceive\r\nthe creature’s enemies. Since it is a slow-moving fish, these color\r\nspots probably create the illusion of fast movement which would fool a\r\npredatory animal of the abysses.\r\n\r\nThis fish is the second of its family ever found in the western world.\r\nThe other was discovered a half century ago the genus have been found\r\nin Asiatic waters.\r\n\r\nThis eye-fish was obtained from a depth of between 150 and 300\r\nfathoms—just about on the borderline of eternal darkness where\r\neyes would be of no use. Fish of the depths have evolved in two\r\ndirections—toward enormous eyes and toward greatly diminished ones.\r\nThe first represents a struggle to see in the strange dusk. The second\r\ntrend denotes giving up of a futile struggle on the part of the race.\r\nThis trend is noteworthy among fish of the greater depths.\r\n\r\nAnother strange denizen of the depths is Peristedion bartschi, named in\r\nhonor of Dr. Bartsch. It is an armored gurnard, of the family sometimes\r\nknown as “sea robins.” The shell-growing tendency among fish is largely\r\nconfined to certain fresh-water catfish of South America. This creature\r\nobviously is a bottom dweller. Its entire body is covered with spiny\r\nplates which probably would make it safe from any enemy. Each plate\r\nbears a very sharp spine, about a quarter inch long. There are nearly\r\na hundred of these on the body. This fish would probably be about the\r\nmost unappetizing morsel any predatory animal ever swallowed. It is\r\nbright red.\r\n\r\nStill another species obtained by the expedition was one of the\r\n“lantern-fish” group. These are small, minnow-like creatures who live\r\nonly in the open ocean. While most fish either remain near shore or\r\nhave at least an association with the bottom these are found only\r\nin deep water far from land, and never near the sea floor. Most of\r\nthe millions of them in the sea doubtless live and die without any\r\nrealization that there is either bottom or shore. All have rows of\r\nluminous spots along their sides which probably serve as recognition\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cannibal Birds of the Pacific_\r\n\r\n\r\nHordes of big black birds, about the nearest creatures imaginable to\r\nthe harpies of Greek mythology, nest on desert-like South Pacific\r\nIslands. These are the vulture-like frigate birds—the Polynesian “iwas”\r\nor “thieves”—which are found by thousands in branches of the most\r\nprominent shrubs, the eight-foot-high, white flowering scaevola bushes.\r\nThey are truly creatures of evil.\r\n\r\nThey carry in their feathers as parasites creatures nearly as\r\nmalevolent in appearance as themselves—louse flies which look like\r\ngiant, flattened black house flies. When these are shaken off they\r\nsometimes fly to small black automobiles which they mistake for their\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\nThe nests of the frigate birds are coarse, soil-cemented affairs\r\nconstructed haphazardly of twigs and driftwood. During showers, the\r\ncement of this filthy building material dissolves away, allowing eggs\r\nto fall to the ground. Nesting material evidently is rare and highly\r\nprized, giving rise to theft. A bird in flight occasionally filches\r\na loose piece from a carelessly guarded nest. The iwa will stoop to\r\nmurder and cannibalism, flying off with an egg or newly hatched young\r\nto eat on the wing. There usually is one egg to a nest, entirely white\r\nand a little larger than a chicken egg.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes take turns sitting on the egg and later brooding the growing\r\nchicks. This is necessary not only to incubate the egg and keep the\r\nchick warm in cool weather, but also as protection against too intense\r\nsunshine. At the incubation time the males are resplendent with blood\r\nred, semi-transparent throat pouches blown out like balloons. These\r\nextend forward to the beak and downward to hide the breast. The color\r\nis due to innumerable blood-filled capillaries in the tissues of the\r\npouch.\r\n\r\nNot far from the rookeries of the iwas are those of the stupid,\r\nred-footed boobies, or gannets. The name booby is from the Spanish\r\nword “bobo”, meaning “idiot”. At times the rookeries of the aggressive\r\nmarauders and the boob-victims overlap at the edges.\r\n\r\nThe frigate birds, according to a report of the Pacific Science Board,\r\n“escort the stupid, spoon-billed gannets out to feed on schools of\r\nsquid and small fish. When the gannets get craws full and set sail for\r\nhome to feed their young, the cruel, curve-billed iwas dive screaming\r\nafter them, seize them by the tails, and sling the food out of the\r\nmouths of the smaller birds. This the iwas scoop up on the wing. This\r\ngoes on from dawn to dusk. The war cries of the frigates and the\r\nplaintive screams of the fleeing gannets quiver down the trade winds\r\nlike the wailings of lost souls.”\r\n\r\nIt is commonly reported that frigate birds, lacking webbed feet, never\r\nland on the surface of the water because they cannot take off again.\r\nThis is not true; small flocks are frequently seen landing playfully on\r\nthe Canton island lagoon, floating, and rising again seemingly without\r\nany effort whatsoever.\r\n\r\n“The birds nesting in the scaevola,” says the report, “are tame or,\r\ndepending on the point of view, too innocent or stupid to fly from\r\ntheir nests when approached. The explanation for this habit is their\r\nnesting from time immemorial in areas where no predatory animals, two\r\nor four legged, ever have existed. (This, by the way, is a notable\r\ncharacteristic of bird life in the Antarctic. The notorious skuas, with\r\nwhom even the frigates could hardly compare for blood-thirstiness,\r\nwill not even bother to move when men pass through a flock of them on\r\nthe ice.) Tame birds were not killed off but lived to reproduce their\r\nkind. Now, unfortunately, Pacific islanders employed as laborers,\r\noccasionally club the nesting birds at night preparatory to a feast.\r\nSuch vandalism and resulting pandemonium in the rookeries should be\r\nstopped by legislation.”\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of these and other kinds of sea birds have inhabited the\r\nislands during the nesting seasons for milleniums, catching fish and\r\nother sea life as food for themselves and their nestlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eagles as Indian Pets_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proud eagle was once kept as a “domestic animal.” Memories of this\r\npractice have been obtained from the Shoshoni Indians of the Nevada\r\ndesert. As recently as fifty years ago individual Indians owned eagle\r\naeries in the mountains. These constituted about the only private\r\nproperty recognized by the tribe and rights were zealously maintained.\r\n\r\nExpert climbers who scaled the cliffs took the young eagles from\r\ntheir nests. They were subsequently reared in cages or tied to rocks.\r\nThe purpose was to harvest their feathers for arrows, decoration, or\r\nmagical rites. The birds were fed pocket gophers and young groundhogs.\r\n\r\nWhen the birds were full grown the feathers were plucked. Then the\r\ncaptives were taken to the top of a cliff and released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Giant Insects of the Carolines_\r\n\r\n\r\nGiant walking sticks seven to nine inches long, titan spiders that walk\r\non water, little black crickets that dive and swim long distances under\r\nwater are some of nature’s curiosities on mountainous, jungle-covered\r\nKusaie, easternmost of the Caroline Islands.\r\n\r\nEspecially unusual are the winged-blue-and-green walking sticks with\r\ntheir fantastic hand-over-hand way of walking. Among the largest of\r\nall insects is a walking stick found on the nearby island of Truk. It\r\nis reddish-brown and wingless with a body nine inches long. The huge\r\nspider’s usual abode is the foliage of long grasses overhanging jungle\r\nstreams. There it lies in wait for the insects which are its usual\r\nprey. When alarmed the big spider drops off the grass into the water\r\nand starts running swiftly over the surface. It is provided with “water\r\nshoes,” bristle arrangements on its feet. Probably it does not even get\r\nits feet wet.\r\n\r\nThe submarine crickets are little black insects about an inch long\r\nwhich live on damp basalt rocks along the sides of, and in, the\r\nstreams. They are almost invisible in the dim jungle light but make\r\nthemselves known by their continuous chirping. When frightened they\r\nmake long, high dives from the rocks and swim for undetermined\r\ndistances a few inches under water, where they are invisible.\r\n\r\nBy far the most fantastic spectacle found on Kusaie is that of the\r\nghostly light which marks the banks of rivers. It is due to some\r\nspecies of ground-growing fungus. A Smithsonian party once was\r\novertaken by darkness high in the mountains where no trails could be\r\nfollowed through the dank jungle. They started wading down a stream\r\nwhich, they knew, eventually must lead to the lowlands and the coast.\r\nThey waded, sometimes neck deep, in a tunnel of overhanging branches\r\nthrough whose thick foliage no light could penetrate. But always,\r\nglowing on both sides of them, were the lines of luminous fungi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Valley Where Dusk is Death_\r\n\r\n\r\nA belt of poison night where death strikes with the dusk extends\r\ndown the western slope of the Peruvian Andes. This death belt, first\r\nreported by a Spanish physician in 1630, consists of a few narrow\r\nvalleys at an elevation of from 3,000 to 8,000 feet in an arid, very\r\ndesolate and sparsely inhabited country. Nearly everyone who spends\r\na night there is afflicted a few days later by a severe anemia which\r\noften proves fatal. This is the “verruga” disease. The red blood cell\r\ncount drops very rapidly. It is not known whether the cells actually\r\nare destroyed by the disease, or whether it inhibits the forming of new\r\nones from the bone marrow. The effect in either case is the same. The\r\nblood loses its capacity to carry oxygen and the victim slowly smothers.\r\n\r\nThe malady is known as Carrión’s disease. In 1885 a Peruvian medical\r\nstudent named Carrión inoculated himself with it to prove its identity.\r\nHe succeeded in showing the cause, at the cost of his own life. He\r\nhad been inspired to the foolhardy act by extreme patriotism. The\r\nChile-Peru war was just over. Most work on the disease had been done\r\nby Chileans. Carión desired that the credit for medical research should\r\ncome back to Peru.\r\n\r\nIf one recovers from the anemia a second stage of the malady sets in.\r\nThe body is covered with wart-like growths, presumably due to some\r\nalteration in the blood supply to the skin. One attack gives immunity\r\nfor life, but the death rate during the first stage is very high.\r\n\r\nDuring daylight the death belt is perfectly safe. This has long been\r\nrecognized by natives who travel through it freely between sunrise and\r\nsunset. The only permanent inhabitants of the region are persons who\r\nhave recovered from the disease. The borders are sharply defined within\r\na few yards of altitude.\r\n\r\nFor some years it has been recognized that the infection comes from\r\nthe bite of a single species of sand fly—a vicious pest smaller than\r\na mosquito. Protection is afforded only by special screens. Ordinary\r\nmosquito netting is worthless. The death belt is a place of bright\r\nsunshine nearly every day. The insects cannot endure light. They remain\r\nsecluded and it is difficult to secure specimens, even when the hiding\r\nplaces are known. As soon as darkness comes they emerge in enormous\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nHarvard entomologists who investigated the death belt a few years ago\r\nspent the hours between sunset and sunrise in a specially screened\r\nrailroad car. A few moments outside might have proved fatal.\r\n\r\nDue to some delicate balance of nature this sand fly seems to be\r\nconfined almost exclusively to this locality. It is credited with\r\ncausing about 7,000 deaths in the decade before the last war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enigma of Evolution: the Snake_\r\n\r\n\r\nSnakes once had legs. There is evidence in their anatomy that they\r\nare descended from four-legged land animals. This evidence is found\r\nespecially in certain bones near the base of the tail of one of the\r\nlargest of living snakes, the python, which is the most primitive of\r\nthe order and presumably nearest to the hypothetical ancestor.\r\n\r\nAlthough the snake remains an enigma of evolution, there is no doubt\r\nthat it got rid of its legs because they were a distinct hindrance to\r\nits peculiar ways of life.\r\n\r\nThe serpent is not very ancient, as animal types go. Evidently it first\r\nappeared in the Cretaceous geological period, about 100,000,000 years\r\nago, when the great dinosaurs were the earth’s dominant animals. There\r\nare, however, no unquestioned fossils of snakes from the dinosaur days.\r\nThe first snake-like creature known is represented by fossils from the\r\nEocene, or “dawn”, age in North America. This was quite lizard-like in\r\nbone structure. It lived about sixty million years ago, when mammals\r\nwere developing on earth. Rocks in Germany, laid down about twenty\r\nmillion years later, yield fossils of true snakes of the generalized\r\nviper type. Sometime later come fossils of snake giants from Egypt.\r\nSome of these probably were sixty feet long. But all these were real\r\nsnakes, with no traces of external limbs. The ancestor seems lost\r\nforever because snake skeletons are brittle and delicate and do not\r\neasily fossilize.\r\n\r\nHaving discarded legs, serpents evolved means of locomotion suitable\r\nto their ways of life. This has sometimes been described as “walking\r\non the ribs.” It requires a highly intricate coordination of ribs and\r\nmuscles and can be compared best to rowing a boat.\r\n\r\n“The life of a serpent,” according to Dr. Alfred Leutscher of the\r\nBritish Museum of Natural History, “is a matter of adjustments for\r\nwhat it has lost. It cannot masticate its food so it swallows it\r\nwhole. It can put a healthy human appetite to shame yet it can, if\r\nforced to do so, starve for more than a year. Limbs are missing, so\r\nit walks on its ribs, swims and grips with its tail, and climbs with\r\nits scales. The outer skin does not grow, so from time to time it is\r\npeeled off neatly, even to the scales over the eyes. Taste is poor,\r\nbut this is compensated for by a strong sense of smell, in which the\r\nharmless tongue assists by catching the smell particles from the air.\r\nIt is proverbially deaf, but may receive ample warning of danger from\r\nvibrations through solid objects, which reach its sensitive skin more\r\nswiftly than sound can travel through air.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fastest Growth on Earth_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning was vestureless life. It was the capacity for self\r\nperpetuation and growth in nature, the property of a single complex\r\nchemical mixture—protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThis protoplasm may have come here from another star, a single grain of\r\ncosmic dust blown out of the infinite. It may have been mixed by chance\r\nin the warm seas of the earth at the beginning of time. It may have\r\nbeen put together according to the design of some cosmic intelligence.\r\nIt tended to segregate into billions of trillions of infinitesimally\r\nminute particles, each sufficient unto itself. The particles were\r\npurposeless, voracious, irresistible and immortal. They threatened to\r\ndevour space and time and all that was in them.\r\n\r\nA cell culture of elemental, inchoate life stuff whose original\r\nsubstance increased theoretically 10,000,000,000,000,000,000-fold\r\nin forty weeks has been described by Dr. Phillip R. White of the\r\nRockefeller Institute. In his experiments he started with a pellet\r\nabout the size of a grain of mustard seed cut from a wart-like\r\nexcrescence on a tobacco plant. He watched it multiply until,\r\narithmetically speaking, if no part had been discarded it would have\r\nbeen an unorganized, purposeless monster spheroid of life 600,000,000\r\nmiles in diameter, comparable in size to the whole solar system inside\r\nthe orbit of Pluto.\r\n\r\nIt had twelve weeks to complete its first year. At the same rate of\r\ngrowth it then would have been a lusty infant the size of 400,000 solar\r\nsystems. In a few more weeks it could have swallowed the whole Milky\r\nWay galaxy. By the end of its second year it would have filled all the\r\nspace in known creation, consumed the substance of all the galaxies,\r\nand perished of starvation as it bulged outward into the emptiness of\r\ninfinity.\r\n\r\nSuch a nightmare actually happened, in reverse. Dr. White had to do\r\neverything in a few test tubes, but he was able to witness such a\r\nphenomenon of growth as man had not hitherto imagined. First he placed\r\nhis pellet in a special nutrient solution. It began to expand by the\r\ncontinuous process of splitting in two. Two cells become four, four\r\neight, and so on infinitely. After about two weeks Dr. White cut away a\r\nfew pellets from the original mass and discarded the rest. These were\r\nplaced in new nutrient solutions. Every two weeks the experimenter\r\nwould discard the bulk of each mass which had accumulated and start new\r\ncultures with the few pellets which he saved. Each culture increased in\r\nsize about fifty percent a day. At the end of forty weeks he was left\r\nwith something not much bigger than he had at the start, but the actual\r\noriginal pellet constituted only about a ten-quintillionth of the final\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nHe happened to have found in the tobacco excrescences an\r\nundifferentiated kind of life. The cells had no specialized function.\r\nIn the actual plant they were kept in order by the rest of the plant\r\ncell community, which has no use for cells with no job to do. Once\r\nin the nutrient solution, however, they were free of all inhibiting\r\ninfluences. They were not, and never became, wood cells, bark cells,\r\npith cells, leaf cells or any of the other numerous, specialized kinds\r\nof cells which make up the plant world. They were something very close\r\nto the primaeval plant cells from which, in the course of a couple\r\nof billion years, all the others have been derived. Very early these\r\nunit structures of life learned that they must stick together and do\r\nspecialized jobs for each other under the actual conditions of nature.\r\nOut of these combinations of specialists has arisen all the magnificent\r\nstructure of the living world.\r\n\r\nBut the experimental cells at the Rockefeller Institution had nothing\r\nto do except eat and multiply. Each of them was potentially immortal.\r\nIt did not die but renewed its youth when it had reached its growth by\r\nbecoming two baby cells. That is how life might have developed from\r\nthe beginning except for the fact that a cell must eat to live and\r\nordinarily does not have any accommodating scientist to feed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Birds That Duel_\r\n\r\n\r\nBirds that hold fencing tournaments are the big-billed toucans of Barro\r\nColorado Island, the Smithsonian Institution’s tropical preserve in\r\nGatun Lake, Panama Canal Zone.\r\n\r\nThey fence with their formidable beaks but seem careful not to hurt one\r\nanother. One scientist who studied Barro Colorado’s bird life described\r\nthe birds as follows: “I saw fourteen toucans scattered about in a big\r\nleafless tree in the center of the jungle. Two appeared to be fencing.\r\nThey stood in one spot and fenced with their bills for a half minute\r\nor so, rested, and were at it again. Presently they flew off into the\r\nforest and then I noticed two others that had now begun to fence. Then\r\none of these flew away, and the remaining one picked a new opponent and\r\nfell to fencing again.... They did not move about much while fencing,\r\nalthough sometimes one climbed above the other as though to gain an\r\nadvantage. They fenced against each other’s beaks and never seemed to\r\nstrike at the body. There was a fairly rapid give and take...the\r\nbills clattering loudly against each other.”\r\n\r\nThese fencing toucans are among the more conspicuous birds of the\r\nisland, particularly because of their call—a shrill, froglike “cree,”\r\nwhich is repeated over and over again and can be heard half a mile\r\naway. The call is most frequent in the morning and late in the\r\nafternoon, but it stops abruptly at sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brakes on Plant Life_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a “brake” on plant development—perhaps one of nature’s most\r\nfundamental controls over surging life. It is a relatively narrow\r\nband of light on the edge of the invisible infrared in the solar\r\nspectrum. Plant life, and through plants all life, is tied intimately\r\nto certain solar wave bands. It has long been recognized that the\r\ncornerstone of all life on earth is the process of photosynthesis\r\nby which plants, through energy provided by sunlight, are able to\r\nsynthesize carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide taken from the\r\nair. Animals eat these carbohydrates, the basic food. Other animals eat\r\nthe carbohydrate eaters, and thus the chain extends from the simplest\r\norganisms to man.\r\n\r\nBut without some other process the carbohydrates might be a formless\r\nmass. The second process is that which shapes a plant and controls\r\ndevelopment of stems, leaves, and blossoms. This may be a light effect\r\nsecond in importance only to photosynthesis itself. It requires\r\nvery little solar energy. Smithsonian Institution experiments have\r\ndemonstrated that the control is exercised by red light with a maximum\r\nof efficiency at wavelengths around 660 millimicrons—or millionths of\r\nmillimeters. It has been demonstrated, however, that this formative\r\naction can be blocked effectively by irradiation with wavelengths in\r\nthe far red. The greatest effect is at wavelengths between 710 and 730\r\nmillimicrons.\r\n\r\nThe “brake” is not applied immediately. The maximum efficiency of\r\nthe far red energy occurs a little more than an hour after the plant\r\nis exposed to the formative wavelengths. The implication is that\r\nthe action interferes with the development process by acting on\r\nsome product the formation of which is initiated by the shorter red\r\nwavelengths. The experiments have been carried out with seedlings of\r\nbeans. In other experiments it has been found that damage to plants\r\nfrom X-ray exposure—insofar as this results in breaking the bundles of\r\ngenes, or units of heredity—can be increased from 30 to 50 percent by\r\nprevious exposure to about the same wave band of far red light that\r\nreverses the formative process. On the other hand, the increase in\r\ndamage is nullified if the X-ray exposure is followed by exposure to\r\nthe red wave band.\r\n\r\nBreaking of the chromosomes, or strings of genes, is one of the first\r\nevidences of damage to living organisms by exposure to ionizing\r\nradiation. This breaking is responsible for some of the adverse\r\nhereditary effects concerning which there has been a great deal of\r\ndiscussion because of possible effects of the atomic bomb fall-out.\r\n\r\nThe experiments were carried out with pollen of flowers and root tips\r\nof beans where results are relatively easy to determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Snails Are the Flowers of the Sea_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more than 80,000 kinds of snails in the world. They swim,\r\njump, crawl, burrow, live at the bottom of the sea and in the tops of\r\ntrees. They range in size from the horse conch of Florida, two feet\r\nlong, to animals hardly the size of a grain of sugar. About half of all\r\nspecies live in the seas.\r\n\r\nMost are bottom dwellers, unable to swim, but several spend their lives\r\non the surface. One, the purple janthina, floats upside down on a raft\r\nof air bubbles trapped in a special kind of mucous which it secretes.\r\nOthers live permanently attached to sea weeds. Most abundant of the\r\nsea snails probably are the pterepods, or sea butterflies, which live\r\nseveral feet below the surface in daylight but come to the top in\r\ncountless hordes at night. In some places the sea bottom is littered\r\nmany feet deep with their shells, of which there is almost constant\r\nrain as the animals die.\r\n\r\nLoveliest flowers of the sea are the nudibranchs. Seldom has nature\r\nproduced in either plants or animals such elaborate combinations of\r\nbrilliant colors and decorative appendages as in the bodies of these\r\nshell-less ocean snails. Although there are more than 2,000 species,\r\nthey are among the least known of all sea creatures. One reason for\r\nthis is that most of them are quite small, ranging from a fourth to\r\nhalf an inch in length. Their coloring hardly can be appreciated except\r\nunder some magnification.\r\n\r\nNowhere are they very abundant. Their habitats vary from close inshore\r\nto deep water, but they are most likely to be seen in pools left\r\namong shore rocks by receding tides. Their extremely elaborate color\r\npatterns may be protective, to some extent. It is known that certain\r\nspecies have the ability to change colors in response to changes in\r\ntheir environment. They become bright red, for example, when living\r\nin association with a red sponge. Even more decorative than the color\r\npatterns are the appendages, extensions of the skin and sometimes of\r\nthe digestive tract, which take the forms of delicately modelled,\r\nalmost microscopic plants.\r\n\r\nAll these nudibranchs are flesh-eating creatures feeding chiefly on sea\r\nanemones found on the sea bottom. Most of the anemones are equipped\r\nwith thousands of so-called nematocysts or stinging organs. These are\r\nmicroscopic, ball-shaped structures filled with a virulent poison. The\r\nsame mechanism is best known in sea nettles. As soon as a nematocyst is\r\nexposed to any tension it explodes, releasing this poison.\r\n\r\nThe little sea snails have evolved the ability to swallow the poison\r\nballs without exploding them. They pass into the digestive tract, but\r\nare not digested. In some way the nematocysts find their way through\r\ncertain of the appendages growing out of the digestive organs to the\r\noutside of the body. There they are retained, and serve the sea snail\r\nin the same way they served the sea anemone. The little creature\r\nbecomes quite dangerous to any of its natural enemies.\r\n\r\nAmong the most enthusiastic nudibranch collectors is the Emperor of\r\nJapan, who has discovered and described several new species. Some of\r\nhis publications about them have been illustrated by leading Japanese\r\nartists and show the unearthly beauty of the creatures to the best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brutal South Pole Birds_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe southernmost birds on earth—the only higher animal except man and\r\nhis dogs that go close to the South Pole—are the Antarctic skuas.\r\nThey are fierce, brutal little killers. Dwellers in the earth’s most\r\ninhospitable habitat, they have been able to survive largely because of\r\ntheir extreme rapaciousness.\r\n\r\nAll other Antarctic birds, such as the penguins, stay close to the\r\nshore of the desolate continent. The skua has been seen at least 300\r\nmiles inland, and occasionally may fly across the pole itself.\r\n\r\nThese birds arrive on the coast of Antarctica about the middle of\r\nOctober, the beginning of the southern summer, after spending the\r\nwinter north of the circle. Their arrival is timed to coincide with\r\nthe egg-laying of the Adelie penguins. The skua’s chief food consists\r\nof penguin eggs and chicks which it devours by the hundreds. Scores\r\nof half-eaten, trampled bodies of young penguins always can be found\r\nduring the hatching season near the sites of penguin rookeries. The\r\nskua is hardly a match for the parent birds but is expert in separating\r\nchicks from the brood and killing them when they have no protection. It\r\nis a creature of relatively enormous strength and endurance and flies\r\nlong distances carrying chunks of meat bigger than itself. It also is\r\nan extremely noisy, quarrelsome creature—an outstanding example of the\r\nphilosophy of every individual for itself. There is no brooding of\r\nchicks nor protecting them from the elements. The parents hardly bother\r\nto feed them.\r\n\r\nLittle skuas, it is reported, come out of the eggs fighting. Usually\r\nthere are two eggs to a nest. One chick probably is a trifle weaker\r\nthan the other. In a short time it is driven from the nest, killed and\r\neaten by its rapacious brother or sister. It may even become the prey\r\nof its own hungry parents. Skuas also have the habit of eating their\r\nown eggs. This keeps the population within the limits of the food\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Silk-Bearded Clams_\r\n\r\n\r\nJason’s golden fleece may have been woven from the beard of a\r\nsilk-bearded clam. The same sort of cloth, in fact, still is produced on\r\na small scale in Italy, chiefly for the tourist trade. A silk glove of\r\nmodern manufacture now is in the Smithsonian collections.\r\n\r\nThe clam is a giant Mediterranean species, the pinna marina. Its shell\r\nreaches a maximum length of about three feet, but the average is less\r\nthan half this. From a gland in its “foot” it secretes milk-like\r\nstrands with which it attaches itself to the sea bottom. These strands\r\nare as much as a foot long.\r\n\r\nThe silk is of exceptionally fine quality—at least it was so regarded\r\nby the Arabs who maintained centers for manufacture of the cloth in\r\nSpain, Italy and North Africa. Says one Arab author: “At a certain time\r\nof the year an animal comes forth from the sea and rubs itself on the\r\nstones of the seashore. A down soft as silk with a golden color falls\r\noff it. It is fine and small and garments are woven from it which take\r\non different colors during the day. The Umayyad kings (of Spain) used\r\nto put restrictions upon it so that it was only exported secretly. The\r\nprice of a garment is more than 100 dinars, on account of its fineness\r\nand beauty.”\r\n\r\nThe value of a dinar—the gold coin of the Moslem world—is difficult to\r\ncalculate in any present coinage, but it was at least the equivalent of\r\na dollar.\r\n\r\nSays another Arab writer: “I have seen how it is gathered. Divers dive\r\ninto the sea and bring out tubers like onions with a kind of neck which\r\nhas hairs on the upper part. The tubers like onions burst and let\r\nforth hairs which are combed and become like wool. They spin it and\r\nmake a woof of it so as to pass a warp of silk through it. The most\r\nmagnificent royal garments of Tunis are made of it.”\r\n\r\nGigantic clams, nearly five feet long and weighing more than 400\r\npounds, who raise crops of microscopic plants for their own sustenance\r\nare among nature’s fantasies found on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.\r\nThese molluscan titans have formed a curious partnership with the\r\nzooxanthellae, a family of microscopic algae. The plants live as\r\nparasites in the blood cells of the inner lobe of the clam’s mantle.\r\nUpon this mantle is a lens-like structure which looks like an eye.\r\nThese mollusks, however, are blind as any other clams and the eye-like\r\nprotuberances, it has been determined, are only windows by which light\r\nis admitted to the parasitic algae within the blood cells. The surplus\r\nof algae is carried by the blood stream to the clam’s digestive organs\r\nwhere it serves as food.\r\n\r\nAnother giant clam, the tridacna of East Indian seas, may weigh up to\r\n600 pounds. The monsters constitute a peril for divers who unwittingly\r\nstep inside the open valves. These snap shut, imprisoning the diver’s\r\nfoot and, unless he can get help, he is held in the trap and drowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pearls Grow in Brooks_\r\n\r\n\r\nExcellent pearls occur occasionally in fresh water clams. A pearl of\r\nperfect form and pure color was found in such a clam taken from a brook\r\nnear Paterson, New Jersey, in 1857. It sold at Tiffany’s for $1,000 and\r\nshortly afterwards was resold in Paris for $2,200. This started pearl\r\nhunts in brooks all over the country.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Europeans in Florida, Louisiana and Virginia,\r\nfabulous legends were circulated about the enormous treasures to be\r\nobtained by plundering Indian graves. A contemporary chronicler of the\r\naudacious DeSoto expedition, reported that the conquistadore got 350\r\npounds of fine pearls at the Creek town of Cofitachique on the Savannah\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nA member of the first Virginia colony “gathered together from among the\r\nsavage people about five thousande; of which number he chose so many\r\nas mayd a fayre chain; which for their likenesse and uniformitie in\r\nroundnesse, orietnesse and pidenesse, of many excellente colours with\r\nequalities in greatnesse were verie fayre and rare.”\r\n\r\nThe supply, however, was quite limited. Indian pearls were the subject\r\nof a special study by the late Dr. William H. Holmes. “The majority\r\nof those obtained,” he reported, “were ruined as jewels by the heat\r\nemployed in opening the shellfish from which they were abstracted. Many\r\nof the larger specimens probably were not real pearls but polished\r\nbeads cut from the nacre of sea shells and quite worthless as gems.\r\nIt has been found that the real pearls were obtained from bivalve\r\nshells—from the oyster along the sea shore and in tidewater inlets and\r\nfrom the mussel on the shores of lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\n“But the very general use of pearls by the pre-Columbian natives is\r\namply attested. More than 60,000, nearly two pecks, were obtained,\r\ndrilled and undrilled, from a single burial mound near Madisonville,\r\nOhio.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grasshopper-Infested Glaciers_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong America’s natural curiosities are “grasshopper glaciers.” These\r\nare great masses of glacial ice containing layers of imbedded, frozen\r\ngrasshoppers. Such layers are probably remnants of vast migrations\r\nwhich have taken place at irregular intervals over several centuries.\r\nGreat hordes of the insects either flew over the glacier or were\r\ncarried there by winds, and while there sudden snow storms or cold air\r\nrising from the ice field caused them to drop. They were imbedded so\r\nquickly in the falling snow, which later became ice, that they have\r\nremained perfectly preserved for centuries. The most notable of these\r\nglaciers is in the Beartooth mountains of Montana. Others have been\r\nreported from the high mountains of Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monster Clams of Polynesia_\r\n\r\n\r\nLargest of clams and largest of all shellfish is a native of Polynesian\r\nseas. The two halves may weigh as much as 500 pounds. The flesh is\r\neaten raw by natives. The interior of the shell is like polished\r\nmarble. Such shells frequently were used as founts for holy water in\r\nEuropean churches. A particularly large one attracted much attention in\r\nthe Church of St. Sulpice in Paris. Such clams are found at depths up\r\nto 17 fathoms. They fasten themselves to rocks by a process so tough\r\nthat it can only be severed with an axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corals Combine Plants and Animal Life_\r\n\r\n\r\nA coral reef is a gigantic “plant-animal.” It is a community of\r\ncountless billions of plants and countless billions of animals which\r\nact as a single organism, like the countless millions of specialized\r\ncells that make up the body of a man or a mouse. It is probably the\r\nmost efficient of all earthly creatures. It is self-sufficient,\r\ncreating its own constant food supply. It is essentially immortal. It\r\nis hungry like an animal. It is motionless like a plant. It is both and\r\ncombines the attributes of both. It is the largest and most enduring of\r\nall creatures of land or sea.\r\n\r\nThe animals are coral polyps. They are tiny, wormlike organisms with\r\nmouths surrounded by constantly probing tentacles. They are rapacious\r\nand insatiable. They are essentially voraciously hungry stomachs,\r\nbloodless, brainless, sightless, heartless. The polyps are close to\r\nthe bottom of animal life, vaguely related to the white, stinging\r\nsea nettles which are the scourges of summer beaches. These little\r\ncreatures extract lime from sea water and secrete for themselves\r\nlimestone “houses,” the “bones” of the superorganism. Out of these they\r\nhave built up islands and almost subcontinents. Sharing their limestone\r\ncells are quite unrelated organisms, single-celled plants or algae.\r\nThese plants possess the green of grass and forests, whose molecules\r\ncreate out of carbon dioxide and water through the energy of captured\r\nsunlight starches and sugars which are the fuel of animal life. This\r\nprocess of photosynthesis is the cornerstone of all life on earth.\r\n\r\nThus the plants feed their partner animals. The excretion of the\r\nanimals, in turn, provides the essential fertilizer of the plants.\r\nConsidering the coral reef as a superorganism one might almost say that\r\nit eats itself but loses nothing in the process. A reef, considered as\r\na superorganism, represents about the last word in nature’s efficiency.\r\nIt has been found, for example, that one acre of coral reef produces\r\nabout 74,000 pounds of sugar a year, a record barely reached by man on\r\nhis most efficiently managed plantations. All this sugar is devoured\r\nby the polyps. Apparently the fertility of the surrounding sea makes\r\nlittle difference. Coral reefs flourish in parts of the ocean that are\r\nessentially deserts.\r\n\r\nA marine biological laboratory has been established by the U. S.\r\nAtomic Energy Commission, to study effects of the radiation from\r\nnuclear explosions on plant-animal populations. The first requirement\r\nhas been to determine the natural condition of the organisms before\r\nbeing subjected to this radiation. Then whatever changes take place\r\nwith subsequent bomb tests can be noted. The work has been undertaken\r\nby biologists of Duke University and the University of Georgia.\r\nSuch a life community, both a vast assembly of organisms and a sort\r\nof superorganism, is an almost perfect subject for the required\r\nobservations. The first job, according to the commission report, has\r\nbeen to measure the “basal metabolism” of the reef as a whole.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the conception of a reef as a sort of superorganism is\r\nsomewhat mystical. The Duke and University of Georgia biologists do not\r\nmaintain that there is any consciousness of constituting a whole on\r\nthe part of the individual organisms. It is likely that they have no\r\nconsciousness of anything. The outstanding fact is that they behave so\r\nmuch like a whole.\r\n\r\nA reef is an outstanding example of the two major divisions of\r\nlife, plant and animal, working in perfect co-operation. The actual\r\nco-operation of plant and animal in an integrated organism is not\r\nunique for the coral reefs. Something of the sort occurs in certain sea\r\nworms, near the bottom of the worm family, that grow green algae in\r\ntheir blood streams. These worms make some of the beaches of Normandy\r\ngrass-green in summer. The algae are necessary for their existence.\r\nThere may be a few other examples throughout the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Engineers—Termites_\r\n\r\n\r\nTermite civilization probably has reached its greatest heights in\r\narchitecture and engineering. Australian mounds, built by workers out\r\nof earth particles cemented together by a salivary gland secretion,\r\nare steeple-shaped, as much as twenty feet high, and with bases twelve\r\nfeet in diameter. Hundreds of such structures may be scattered over\r\na few acres. Such an assemblage looks like a large native village,\r\nalthough architecturally the structures are far beyond the abilities\r\nof primitive man. The common type consists of a solid, hard outer\r\nwall which has the strength of superfine concrete. It is almost\r\nimpossible to break through this material. Immediately inside are\r\nnumerous thin-walled passages and galleries. Below these, at the ground\r\nlevel and about in the center, are the quarters of king and queen\r\nand the nursery. From the mound, passages for the food foragers lead\r\nin all directions through the soil. A mound two feet high will house\r\napproximately two million individuals.\r\n\r\nLong before architects, termites developed the art of air conditioning.\r\nProper humidity inside the nest is essential to the existence of the\r\nsoft-bodied workers. The majority of species, however, are found in\r\nlatitudes with long, dry seasons. To meet such conditions the insects\r\nachieved humidity control in various ways still not understood. Notable\r\nare the structures of the Australian compass termites who erect\r\ndwellings eight to twelve feet high with flattened sides. The broad\r\nends always point east and west, the narrow ends north and south. These\r\nnests are strong enough to support the stamping of wild bulls. A group\r\nof them looks like a particularly well-constructed native village, or\r\nthe site of some extinct human civilization. Apparently the precise\r\norientation of the nests is associated with prevailing winds and in\r\nsome way contributes to maintaining a constant humidity.\r\n\r\nThe blind creatures seem to have developed special sense organs,\r\nunknown to man and probably unique in the animal kingdom. One of these\r\nis reportedly a brain barometer which is extremely sensitive to slight\r\nhumidity changes. Both soldiers and workers respond with military\r\nprecision to any threat to their neighbors. This believed due to an\r\nextreme sensitivity to vibration.\r\n\r\nFew varieties of termites can endure sunshine. Some construct paperlike\r\numbrellas which they carry with them when they come above ground. One\r\nspecies on Barro Colorado island in the Panama Canal Zone which attacks\r\nlive trees first builds a thin earth crust around the trunk, seven to\r\neight feet from the earth. Beneath this crust they seek out weak spots\r\nin wood which enable them to penetrate into the heart of the tree.\r\n\r\nTermite armies, in distinction from those of ants, serve only as\r\ndefensive forces. There are two kinds of soldiers. Some are equipped\r\nwith enormous jaws with which to rend the enemy. These are so tenacious\r\nthat when the body is torn away from the prey the mandibles remain in\r\nplace. Others are the bayonet men and chemical warfare troops. These\r\nfighters have a protrusion on the front of the head which looks like a\r\nlong nose but which actually has developed from a primitive eye.\r\n\r\nFrom this protrusion a sticky acid is exuded. In rare instance it may\r\nbe spurted a short distance—an inch or less. These soldiers fight\r\nbattles to the death with war-like ants which invade their nests. The\r\ntermite warrior rams with his nose-like organ the so-called “pedicle”\r\nof the ant, the narrowest part of its body, smearing it with the\r\nliquid. This never has been completely analyzed. It is a powerful acid,\r\nbut is not the well-known formic acid exuded by ants. It has strong\r\ncorrosive properties when applied to metals. It has a pungent odor\r\nwhich, however, is characteristic of all termites and the ancestral\r\ncockroaches.\r\n\r\nBetween ants and termites there is perpetual war. Army ants,\r\nespecially, try to raid termite nests to feed on the young whenever\r\nthey can find any crack in the walls through which they can squeeze\r\ntheir bodies. But when there is any break in the nest the termite\r\nsoldiers immediately arrange themselves in a circle around the opening\r\nwhile workers bring up little slabs of earth from the interior to patch\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nMost common of the Barro Colorado species are the amitermes which build\r\nhemisphere-shaped red mounds about two feet in diameter. These are made\r\nof tiny particles of earth which have passed through the alimentary\r\ntracts of the insects where they are coated with a cement-like\r\nmaterial. Such a nest is impervious to water. It is so sturdy that a\r\nheavy man can jump up and down on it without breaking the roof. It\r\ncannot be broken open with a machete.\r\n\r\nAnother common species build the so-called “niggerhead” nests, about\r\nthe size of footballs, on fence posts and trees,—especially dead trees\r\nwhose stumps protrude out of Gatun Lake. These nests also are extremely\r\nsturdy. They are made of a mixture of earth grains and finely digested\r\nwood. From such a nest numerous runways traverse the trunk, sometimes\r\nconnecting with smaller colonial “niggerheads.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oyster Oddities_\r\n\r\n\r\nAn oyster can change its sex several times during its life. This has\r\nbeen determined by Dr. Paul Galtsoff of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife\r\nService by observing an experimental colony. In the first year 8% of\r\nthe males changed to females and 13% of the females became males. In\r\nthe second year 11% of the males changed sex and 12% of the females.\r\nOne sex change, Dr. Galtsoff found, makes the same individual more\r\nlikely to undergo another.\r\n\r\nA single Pacific coast oyster produces approximately 10,000,000,000\r\ndescendants a year. If all survived in five generations they would\r\nconstitute a mass eight times the size of the world.\r\n\r\nClams and oysters appear to be about the most stupid animals in\r\ncreation. Actually each has three “brains,” or nerve ganglia. One\r\ncontrols the feeding apparatus, another the viscera, and a third the\r\nutilization of oxygen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The World’s Biggest Sneeze_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sneeze of the elephant has been described as “like the bursting of\r\na boiler of considerable size.” When the elephant feels the onset of\r\none of these titanic eruptions it appears to realize that a momentous\r\nevent is about to take place. It becomes extremely restless and is\r\nseemingly unable to stand still for a moment. The sneeze is preceded by\r\na tremendous, wall-shaking bellow.\r\n\r\nAlthough elephants are subject to frequent colds the sneeze is a\r\nrare phenomenon. For this reason it is regarded as a good luck sign,\r\nespecially among Moslems of India, who gather around and wait patiently\r\nfor the event. When it starts they bow their heads and pray for the\r\nrealization of their wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Luminescent Ctenophores_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are windless nights when Caribbean waters seem like fields of\r\ngreen fireflies. This is due to vast numbers of luminescent ctenophores\r\nor comb-bearers. One the most abundant and least known forms of animal\r\nlife, they are also among the most delicate. Although they are related\r\nto the planarian worm and the jelly fish, they are quite unique.\r\n\r\nSuperficially they seem little more than animate bags of water with\r\nskins thinner than the most delicate tissue paper. They abound in\r\nstaggering numbers over most of the world. One of the most familiar\r\ntypes is the American mnemiopsis. On calm summer days the amber green\r\nspecies sometimes covers completely thousands of square yards of\r\nsea—like a raft formed of millions of individuals floating just below\r\nthe surface. A classic ground for this phenomenon is Narragansett Bay.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of its race, this ctenophore is like a fragment of\r\nmoonlight on the sea. It is so fragile that the slightest current of\r\nwater in its neighborhood is sufficient to tear it to bits. It is about\r\nas elusive as moonlight. When grasped gently the jelly-like substance\r\nslides through the fingers. Taken in a net and placed in salt water\r\nit vanishes completely on the way from boat to laboratory. Intact\r\nspecimens are almost unknown in scientific collections.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily they live at considerable depths in the zone of absolute\r\ncalm where all wave movement ceases. Great hordes rise to be the\r\nsurface only on nights when the surface of the ocean is like a sheet of\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThey are among the loveliest of all sea creatures. The delicacy of\r\ntheir coloring is that of spring arbutus or anemone. Their presence is\r\nindicated chiefly by the brilliant flashes of rainbow colors as they\r\npass a few inches below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe majority are pear-shaped. Giant of the race is Venus' girdle, best\r\nknown in the Mediterranean but found in most sub-tropical seas and\r\nsometimes swept as far north as the coast of New England. It is an\r\nundulating, iridescent ribbon as much as five feet long and two inches\r\nwide. The mnemiopsis of southern New England waters is ball-shaped with\r\na diameter of about four inches.\r\n\r\nCtenophores are most varied in the Bay of Naples; there 18 species have\r\nbeen identified. There are 14 species now known in the Caribbean. In\r\nabsolute numbers, however, the fragile creatures are most abundant in\r\nNorth Atlantic and sub-Arctic waters where, because of ordinarily rough\r\nseas, they seldom are seen. There they constitute one of the major\r\nmenaces of the cod fisheries. Despite their fragility they are vicious\r\nlittle animals, devouring cod eggs and fry in incalculable numbers.\r\n\r\nEach living water bag has a slit-like mouth on top and what apparently\r\nis a sense organ of some kind on the bottom. The minute, struggling\r\nprey are seized in two pincer-like tentacles and pushed into the mouth.\r\nThey are digested quickly by the juices in the water sack in which\r\nfloat about whatever vital organs the Ctenophore possesses.\r\n\r\nThe ctenophores are by no means aberrant jellyfish, which they resemble\r\nonly in the extreme tenuousness of their bodies. They have no umbrellas\r\nand no stinging cells. Two forms are known which have flattened\r\nbodies like planarian worms and which creep on the sea floor. Because\r\nof various similarities in the development of both creatures some\r\nzoologists believe they are immediate descendants of a unknown common\r\nancestor.\r\n\r\nThe function of their weird green luminescence is unknown. It would\r\nseem of questionable value in attracting prey and it is difficult to\r\nimagine that these most fragile and evanescent of earth’s creatures\r\nhave any sort of love life. Nevertheless lightmaking seems to\r\nconstitute a purposeful part of their activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Forest That Time Forgot_\r\n\r\n\r\nKnee-high red and pink ferns fill the jungle hollow. Around them are\r\ngreen leaves covered with parallel white lines in sets of five with\r\ndots on the lines which look like notes of music. These leaves are\r\nknown as “music paper.” There is no record that anybody has tried to\r\nplay the tunes nature has written on them.\r\n\r\nMixed with them are “sandpaper leaves” with surfaces so rough that they\r\nare used locally for the same purpose as sheets of sandpaper elsewhere.\r\nSinister hangman’s ropes swing, as if awaiting their victims, from\r\nbranches along the jungle paths.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few random notes from a cloudland jungle—in many ways like\r\na forest of prehistoric days—in Venezuela’s Henry Pittier national\r\nforest. Here flourishes the giant tree fern, most characteristic tree\r\nof the vast ancient forests from which coal deposits were formed. In\r\nthe tree fern fronds lurk worms and amphibians not vastly different\r\nfrom the tree creatures of the Devonian geological area.\r\n\r\nThis is a forest of the central tropics. Paradoxically it is also, when\r\nseen from a little distance, a New England forest of late September\r\nwith groves of straight, white-trunked palm trees which look like\r\nbirches and patches of flame color in the treetops which look like\r\nmaple leaves starting to put on their autumn coloring. The temperature,\r\nin fact, is about that of a warm Autumn day in New England, especially\r\nas dusk comes and a white veil of mist rolls over the mountaintops from\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe patches of flame color which look like maple leaves are orange\r\nand red blossoms of the gallito or “cock flowers,” so called because\r\nthe bloom resembles so much the body of a miniature rooster. The\r\ngallito appears high in the treetops. It is about the most abundant and\r\nconspicuous flower of the cloud jungle. It grows on big, grey-trunked\r\ntrees whose bark looks like rough-woven linen. Each blooming tree is\r\nfilled with brilliantly colored humming birds and red and green parrots.\r\n\r\nTrees in the high jungle hills wear thick green overcoats of moss and\r\nlichens. There is one dark-green form of moss which grows about an\r\ninch high and looks like a miniature cedar leaf. Many of the older\r\ntrees, especially palms, are “rusty” with a species of red lichen which\r\nspreads rapidly over the trunks. Among them is a blossoming tree with\r\na straight, spined grey trunk from 30 to 40 feet high which is a close\r\nrelative of the potato.\r\n\r\nThe cloud forest is predominantly the home of the epiphytes, such as\r\nlong, dangling masses of red, pink and pearl orchids which grow on the\r\ntrees. They require plenty of moisture. In this mountain swamp the\r\ntrees always are soaking wet. This is an ideal environment for the\r\neight or ten varieties of moss which grow so luxuriantly.\r\n\r\nThere are green-walled cave openings ten feet high and ten feet wide in\r\nthe bottoms of the trunks of giant trees. Exposed roots lie across the\r\npaths, covered with moss in which there are leprous white spots. They\r\nlook like enormous, writhing malevolent green serpents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Versatility of the Elephant’s Trunk_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elephant’s trunk is a tool surpassed in effectiveness only by the\r\nhand of man. It is a muscular prolongation of combined nose and upper\r\nlip, which have grown together. It is associated closely with the motor\r\nand sensory centers in the brain cortex and is under such delicate\r\nvoluntary control that with its enormous strength is combined extreme\r\nfineness of movement. The trunk terminates in one of two fingerlike\r\nprojections which seem capable of almost as delicate voluntary\r\nmovements as are human fingers.\r\n\r\nThe trunk is a supernose. As a sensory organ it is the elephant’s\r\nchief means of securing information about his environment. With it the\r\nanimal can detect the direction, and perhaps the distance, of olfactory\r\nstimuli from all sorts of sources. It is as vital in an elephantine\r\nscheme of things as are eyes to a human being.\r\n\r\nThe trunk is the elephant’s chief servant Without it the monster is the\r\nequivalent of a blind man. It has approximately 40,000 muscles and a\r\nhighly developed sensory and motor nerve supply. The organ has enormous\r\nstrength, sufficient to tear up a tree by its roots.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the things the animal is credited with being able to\r\ndo with the trunk: pick up a pin from the ground, select and secure\r\na single tussock of appetizing herbage, uncork a wine bottle, untie\r\na slip knot, unbolt a gate, throw up and catch a baseball, pull the\r\ntrigger to fire a gun, ring a bell.\r\n\r\nA female elephant owned by the Duke of Devonshire in the 1880’s was\r\nallowed almost a free range over the park of his estate. She made\r\nherself useful by sweeping the paths with a broom and by carrying\r\na garden watering pot. Her most celebrated achievement was that of\r\nopening a tightly corked wine bottle. She would hold it against the\r\nground at about a 45 degree angle with one of her front feet and\r\ngradually twist out the cork—barely protruding above the neck of the\r\nbottle—with her trunk. After emptying the contents into her mouth she\r\nwould hand the empty bottle to her keeper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fiendish Vampires of the Night_\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the eighteenth century belief in vampirism spread\r\nlike an epidemic across France and England. Dead men hellishly\r\ncondemned to live forever came out of their sepulchres at midnight,\r\ntook the forms of various animals, and feasted on the blood of\r\nthe living (who, in turn, died and became vampires). This was a\r\nsuperstition which previously had been confined largely to Slavic\r\ncountries. Its influence in France and England seems to have started\r\nwith tales brought back from the New World by Spanish explorers of\r\nactual vampires—sinister, black-winged, fiend-faced flying mammals who\r\nactually fed on the blood of sleeping humans. Thenceforth the popular\r\nconception of a vampire was that of a large bat, hovering over the\r\nunsuspecting, eternally doomed sleeper.\r\n\r\nThe stories doubtless were greatly ornamented and exaggerated. However,\r\nthe vampire bat of the American tropics is a gruesome reality. It is\r\nnow known to be a carrier of the rabies virus.\r\n\r\nIt is a small, brown bat condemned by nature to live exclusively on\r\nblood. Its throat is too small to swallow solid particles. Its stomach\r\nis especially adapted for rapid digestion. It feasts on all sorts of\r\nmammals, including man, and the incisions of its razor-sharp teeth are\r\nso nearly painless that a sleeper seldom is awakened. Supposedly it\r\nalways bites man on the bottoms of the toes.\r\n\r\nThe loathsome little creature does not actually suck blood, as long\r\nwas supposed. Instead, according to observers, it laps up blood with\r\nits tongue. Its saliva is believed to contain an anti-coagulant which\r\nkeeps a wound bleeding for hours. From 20 to 25 minutes is required for\r\na meal, during which the animal gorges itself until its body becomes\r\nspherical.\r\n\r\n“We slept so soundly”, records an Amazon explorer, “it was not until\r\nmorning we discovered that we had been raided during the night by\r\nvampire bats and the whole party was covered with blood stains from\r\nthe many bites. It may seem unreasonable to the uninitiated that we\r\ncould have been thus bitten and not disturbed in our sleep but the fact\r\nremains that there is no pain produced at the time of the bite, nor for\r\nseveral hours afterwards.”\r\n\r\nIt feeds only at night Like most New World tropical bats, it sleeps\r\nduring the day in the total darkness of caverns where it hangs in\r\nclusters from the ceilings. Such a bat cave, about as gruesome a place\r\nas could be found on earth, was explored a few years ago by Dr. Raymond\r\nL. Ditmars of the American Museum of Natural History. This cave, which\r\nthe bats shared with scorpions who had wing spreads of five inches, was\r\nfound in the Chagras Valley of Panama.\r\n\r\nThe mammal has a strikingly spider-like appearance. Probably alone\r\namong bats it can walk as a quadruped, using its wings as front feet.\r\nThat, of course, is what they were originally before the grotesque\r\ncreatures invaded the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarkable Orchids_\r\n\r\n\r\nA flower that opens only in moonlight is one of Venezuela’s plant\r\ncuriosities. It is an ivory white, velvety orchid with a dazzling\r\nblossom. For full fertilization it depends entirely on nocturnal\r\nbutterflies which sip nectar while pollenization takes place.\r\n\r\nThis curious flower is one of approximately 800 orchid species, some of\r\nthem among the most beautiful in the world, which grow in Venezuela.\r\nAmong these is probably the prettiest and rarest of all orchids, the\r\nmother-of-pearl flower which can be found, and then only rarely, in the\r\nGran Sabana country at altitudes of more than 3,000 feet. Only a few\r\nspecimens ever have been brought out by collectors.\r\n\r\nAnother high mountain variety has square petals with fringed edges.\r\nFound in the jungles of the upper Orinoco is an orchid with blossoms\r\nmeasuring up to 16 inches in diameter. A completely unique orchid has\r\nbeen found growing in water. (All other species live as parasites on\r\ntrees or rocks—or in the soil like other plants.)\r\n\r\nThroughout the world there are more than 20,000 species of orchids, the\r\ngreat majority of which are found only in the mountainous regions of\r\nthe tropics. A few, however, can be found growing as far north as the\r\nArctic Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature’s Insecticide: The Millipede_\r\n\r\n\r\nFar leas malevolent than the centipede—and probably a somewhat more\r\nprimitive form of animal life—is the millipede or “thousand legs”. It\r\nis a strictly vegetarian creature that lives under stones, logs or in\r\nrotting tree trunks and feeds on soft roots, leaves and fruits.\r\n\r\nMillipedes are seldom seen. They shun light, although in the tropics\r\nthey sometimes come out of their retreats after heavy rains and crawl\r\nover the ground. The animal has twenty to forty legs, two pair on each\r\nsegment of the body—a characteristic in which it differs striking from\r\nthe centipedes to whom it is only distantly related. Movement is in\r\nan almost mathematically straight line, with a series of wave-like\r\nundulations in which apparently all the legs on one side of the body\r\nmove in unison. All millipedes are essentially blind. Their eyes are\r\nable only to distinguish light from dark, but as they crawl every inch\r\nof their path is explored by their delicately sensitive antennae.\r\n\r\nSo secretive is their life that relatively little is known of their\r\nbehavior. The female of one European species burrows in the earth,\r\nmoistens bits of soil with a sticky fluid from the salivary glands in\r\nher mouth, and thus makes tiny bricks. These she builds into the form\r\nof a hollow sphere, about the size of a walnut, with a hole in the top\r\nthrough which she lays from 50 to 100 eggs. Others lay their eggs in\r\nbunches in the soil and coil around them until they hatch. Mothers may\r\neven remain with the young for a few days.\r\n\r\nThe bite of the millipede, unlike that of the centipede, is not\r\npoisonous. But the animal has “stink glands” from which a foul-smelling\r\nliquid containing the extremely poisonous prussic acid is exuded. This\r\npresumably affords an adequate protection against driver ants and\r\nbirds, the natural enemies. The secretion is so powerful that a couple\r\nof millipedes placed in a can kill insects as effectively as a small\r\ndose of potassium cyanide.\r\n\r\nOne member of the race, spirobolus marginatus, as much as four inches\r\nlong and with a body made up of fifty-seven segments, is fairly common\r\nunder logs in the northeastern United States. At certain seasons these\r\ncreatures become restless, leave the soil and come into houses. They\r\nmay swarm in basements and on ground floors. They crawl up walls and\r\ndrop from ceilings. These invasions usually take place in the autumn\r\nand presumably are associated with migrations to find winter quarters.\r\nIn some cottages surrounded by trees as many as seven hundred have\r\nbeen counted in a room in one evening. However embarrassing to hosts,\r\nit must be realized that millipedes never bite and that they do no\r\ndamage to furniture. The only accusation yet made against them refers\r\nto one species, the so-called greenhouse millipede, which may cause\r\nconsiderable damage to potted plants.\r\n\r\nIn emergencies the millipede is able to roll itself in a tight\r\nball like its presumed ancestors, the primaeval trilobites. In one\r\nMadagascan species this ball is as big as a golf ball. Some millipedes\r\nare less than a twentieth of an inch long.\r\n\r\nGigantic millipedes are known from the tree fern swamps of the\r\nCarboniferous geological period when the great coal deposits were\r\nformed. They were about a foot long and their bodies were covered with\r\nlong, sharp spines. This apparently was to make them distasteful to\r\nthe giant amphibians, remotely related to present day frogs and toads,\r\nwho were the dominant four-footed animals in the world at the time.\r\nThus the millipede has almost as lengthy a history on earth as the more\r\ninsect-like cockroach of those same forests of 250,000,000 years age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bats Have Built-in Radar_\r\n\r\n\r\nBats “see” with their ears. Echoes of sounds inaudible to man enable\r\nthe flying mammals to find their way through the almost absolute\r\ndarkness of deep cavern or jungle. These creatures might be considered\r\ninventors of the Navy’s sonar device by which underwater obstacles are\r\nlocated by echoes—or even, in a sense, of radar.\r\n\r\nAlmost entirely creatures of night and late twilight, bats have small\r\nand poorly developed eyes. When one is on the wing it emits an almost\r\nconstant succession of inaudible “squeaks” at a sound frequency of\r\nbetween 25,000 and 70,000 vibrations a second. The human hearing range\r\nreaches only to 30,000. Each squeak, according to measurements by Dr.\r\nDonald R. Griffin of Cornell University, lasts about two-hundredths of\r\na second. In ordinary flight over open country it is repeated about ten\r\ntimes a second. By means of the echoes it apparently is possible to\r\ndetect and avoid any obstacle, even one as small as a strand of silk\r\nthread strung across the path, within a distance of ten or twelve feet.\r\n\r\nThe bat does not hear its own squeaks. Each time one is uttered an ear\r\nmuscle contracts automatically, thus momentarily shutting off the sound\r\nitself so that only the echo can be heard. It is possible that each\r\nanimal has its individual sound pattern and is guided only by its own\r\nechoes. Otherwise, it would seem, there would be complete confusion\r\nfrom the echoes of several hundred bats moving in a flock.\r\n\r\nLargest of the bats are northern India’s flying foxes. The body is\r\nshaped almost precisely like that of a small fox and is covered with\r\nfine, dark-brown hair. The wing spread is about three feet. These\r\nflying foxes move in flocks of thousands. They are exclusively fruit\r\neaters and forest dwellers. They are the only bats eaten by man. Their\r\nflesh is said to resemble chicken.\r\n\r\nInsect-eating bats are prisoners of the air. Once on the wing they\r\nmust remain in flight all night until they return to the dark caves\r\nwhere they sleep all day, suspended head downwards. Flying from dusk\r\nto dawn requires an enormous amount of energy for which a lot of food\r\nis required. One of these animals probably must eat about a third of\r\nits own weight in insects each night. Thus it is a good friend of the\r\nfarmer and one of the potent factors in keeping the balance of nature.\r\n\r\nIf a bat lit on the ground or on any solid object it would be very\r\ndifficult, perhaps impossible, to get it on the wing again. This is\r\naccomplished only by falling from its sleeping place.\r\n\r\nThe hibernation of temperate zone bats appears very close to complete\r\nlifelessness and is probably the most deathlike sleep experienced by\r\nany mammal. Animals close to a cave entrance have been found completely\r\ncoated with ice, as moisture has congealed on the fur. Yet when they\r\nwake in the spring they appear none the worse for the experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crabs That Climb Trees_\r\n\r\n\r\nA fantastic race of small, pale hermit crabs are the most numerous\r\nand conspicuous animal inhabitants of war-wrecked Pacific islands.\r\nThe multitudes of these crustaceans may have a considerable role,\r\nbeneficial and otherwise, in present efforts to cover these white sand\r\nwastes with grass and trees.\r\n\r\nOf all creatures which start life in the sea, hermit crabs have become\r\nbest adapted to continual existence on land. Like others of their race\r\nthey are shell-less and soft-bodied. For protection against enemies and\r\nagainst being dried out by the glaring sun, they live in houses—the\r\nabandoned shells of other sea creatures which have been cast ashore.\r\nThey carry their houses on their backs. When a crab outgrows its\r\nshelter it moves to a larger one, changing its dwelling four or five\r\ntimes during a normal lifetime. There is never any housing shortage\r\nfor those in the small stages of growth. However, the sole refuge for\r\nthe crab which has reached full size is the “cats-eye,” the shell of\r\na marine snail as much as three inches in diameter with an opalescent\r\npink inner lining which glistens like the eye of a cat. Only the\r\nhermits which can find such shells survive.\r\n\r\nIn searching for food the crabs climb the trunks and branches of kou\r\ntrees which grow all over the Pacific islands. They eat the bark along\r\nthe upper side of the branches; most trees show long scars which are\r\nthe results of past injuries.\r\n\r\nA common habit, especially of the undersized individuals, is cleverly\r\nto tear off and eat only the ovaries and stamens of blossoming plants.\r\n“These are certainly not isolated acts,” says a Pacific Science Board\r\nreport, “but ones perfected by practice and perhaps instinct. The\r\ncrabs probably decimate the flora, feeding particularly on tender\r\nseedlings. They largely are responsible for the paucity of different\r\nkinds of plants on some islands. The seeds of any new kinds of\r\nplants washing to its shores are subject to their inspection and,\r\nif palatable, sacrificed to their appetite. The foreign plants now\r\nbeing introduced as seeds and seedlings must not only surmount the\r\ndrastic condition of drought and salinity but also the hurdle of these\r\nvoracious animals.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring the females carry their numerous maroon colored eggs\r\nattached to their abdomens. When do they return to the ocean to allow\r\nthese eggs to hatch their free-swimming larvae that resemble so closely\r\nthe shrimp-like ancestor of all hermit crabs? Where do they throw off\r\nthe hard, non-expanding shells they have requisitioned as they increase\r\nin size, in burrows on land or in the ocean? How, with gills adapted\r\nfor respiration in water, have they perfected respiration on land?\r\nQuestions such as these are still unanswered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ferocious Centipede_\r\n\r\n\r\n“Natives of Brazil call the centipede the ambua. These creatures of a\r\nthousand legs, some of which are more than a foot long, bend as they\r\ncrawl along and are reckoned very poisonous. In their going it is\r\nobservable that on each side of their bodies every leg has its motion,\r\none regularly after the other; being numerous, their legs have a kind\r\nof undulation and thereby communicate to the body a swifter progression\r\nthan one would imagine where so many short feet are to take so many\r\nshort steps that follow one another, rolling on like the waves of the\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century British naturalist Charles Owen was not alone in\r\nconsidering the millipedes and centipedes as kinds of snakes; nor in\r\nbeing confused, as naturalists still are, at their curious, complicated\r\nway of moving. There had been highly exaggerated reports. The Spaniard\r\nUlloa, Columbus' gold assayer, described some centipedes he saw on the\r\nnorthern coast of South America as a yard long and six inches wide.\r\nTheir bite, he contended, was fatal.\r\n\r\n“In the Kubbo-Kale valley,” reported British naturalist H. S. Wood\r\nin 1935, “I saw a centipede ten inches long. Its general color was\r\nelectric blue with bright coral red fangs. It was the most terrible\r\nthing I have seen in my tramps through the forest.” Wood was stung by\r\none of these Indian centipedes; he described the sensation as “exactly\r\nlike that of a third degree burn.”\r\n\r\nThese animals are neither snakes, insects nor worms. They constitute an\r\nindependent and intermediate order of animal life. They are considered\r\na little nearer to the spiders than to true insects. They have retained\r\nthe ways of life of the ancestral worm.\r\n\r\nMost of the centipedes are active, ferocious, flesh-eating animals.\r\nTheir poison fangs are deadly to their normal prey—earthworms and\r\ninsects. Some of the larger species do not hesitate to attack lizards\r\nand small mice. A bite, however painful, probably never is fatal to\r\na human. All are land animals which creep or crawl under logs and\r\nbark. They usually remain in seclusion during the day but come out of\r\ntheir retreats at night when they wander over the ground and attract\r\nattention to themselves by their phosphorescence. A few have been\r\ndescribed as sea dwellers but these do not actually live in the water.\r\nThey crawl along the shore and are submerged by each tide. Some or\r\ncompletely blind, others have many eyes.\r\n\r\nThe centipedes are among the most repulsive of all animals, yet there\r\nare accounts of South American Indian children who drag very large ones\r\nout of the earth and eat them. Religious fanatics among North African\r\nArabs swallow them alive as proof of their supernatural powers.\r\n\r\nTropical America has many varieties with varied and curious habits,\r\nlike the Nicaraguan species described by Thomas Belt:\r\n\r\n“Among the centipedes was one which had a singular method of securing\r\nprey. It is about three inches long and sluggish in its movements but\r\nfrom its tubular mouth it is able to discharge a viscid fluid to a\r\ndistance of about three inches, which stiffens with exposure to the air\r\nto the consistency of a spider’s web, but stronger. With this it can\r\nenvelope and capture its prey, just as a fowler throws his net over a\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n“Some of the other centipedes have phosphorescent spots in the head,\r\nwhich shine brightly at night, casting a greenish light for a little\r\ndistance in front of them. I think these lights may serve to dazzle or\r\nallure the insects on which they prey.”\r\n\r\nCentipedes have been observed attacking earthworms. One may grapple\r\nwith its victim for several hours before killing it. Then it sucks the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nA fairly familiar visitor in the southern United States is a house\r\ncentipede which thrives in damp basements and sometimes invades ground\r\nfloors. It is a wormlike creature, about an inch long, with fifteen\r\npairs of long legs. In the female the last pair are twice as long as\r\nthe rest of the body. The animal is yellowish grey with white bands on\r\nits legs. It is poisonous, but its jaws are weak and it seldom bites\r\nhuman beings. Despite the evil reputation of its race, this centipede\r\nshould be a welcome guest for it feeds on cockroaches, flies, spiders,\r\nmoths, and other domestic pests. It is a fast runner but often stops\r\nsuddenly, remains absolutely motionless for a moment, and then darts\r\nfor concealment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Plant That Makes Men Dumb_\r\n\r\n\r\nA plant now being cultivated in the newly established botanical garden\r\nof the University of Caracas may prove to be nature’s greatest boon to\r\npestered husbands and harassed mothers. It is described only under the\r\npopular Spanish name of “planta del mudo.” It looks like sugar cane.\r\nAccording to reliable reports anybody who chews the stem is stricken\r\ndumb for 48 hours.\r\n\r\nOther curiosities of the garden include a plant which allegedly can\r\nstimulate hair growth on bald heads and a bush whose blossoms open\r\nsnow-white in the morning and turn red at noon. Here also blooms the\r\nexotic “Queen of Night,” a climbing cactus with a white flower five\r\ninches in diameter which opens at sunset and closes at sunrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scourge of the Earth: Locusts_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the days of the Hebrews prophets a visitation of locusts has been\r\nconsidered one of the plagues of God. A migration of millions of these\r\ngrasshopper-like insects in clouds obscuring the sun leaves behind a\r\ncountryside devastated as though by fire. In flight they sound like a\r\nforest fire being spread by a brisk wind. Whenever they come to earth\r\nareas of hundreds of square yards almost immediately are denuded of\r\neverything green.\r\n\r\nIn history their raids have been associated chiefly with the Near East.\r\nQuite similar creatures have caused far-reaching destruction over most\r\nof the world including the United States.\r\n\r\nThe last such phenomenon was about 1880. Since then grasshoppers have\r\nhopped, not flown. There have been some great invasions, but the\r\ninsects have moved along the ground where it is easier to combat them.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the transformation was found a few years ago by\r\nentomologists. Hopping grasshoppers are changed into flying\r\ngrasshoppers by heat and hunger. Grown in test cages at high\r\ntemperatures and deprived of succulent green food, the insects acquired\r\nlonger wings, became slimmer, and took on brighter colors.\r\n\r\nIt apparently is a curious provision of nature to preserve the\r\ngrasshopper race. When on the edge of perishing, they are supplied with\r\nwings to carry them to green pastures a few hundred miles away. Lately\r\nthere has been some indication that those in the western United States\r\nmight again enter the flying phase in the near future. During the great\r\ndrought of the early thirties there was a stimulus almost sufficient to\r\nmake them undergo the complete transformation.\r\n\r\nAt present there seems little prospect that there will be another\r\nflying cloud in this part of the world. By planting cultivated crops\r\non land formerly covered by grass, man provides good egg-laying grounds\r\nand plenty of green food.\r\n\r\nAdequate information still is lacking on what makes grasshoppers\r\nincrease and decrease. Also a mystery is the mechanism by which the\r\nharmless solitary phase is transformed into the dangerous gregarious\r\nphase. Several types occur in both phases and each can change itself\r\ninto the other, altering their habits so that they attack in mass\r\nrather than as individuals.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1870s the flying clouds caused terror all over the\r\nworld. In parts of Minnesota where the locusts landed they covered the\r\nground three inches thick. Crops were destroyed throughout the prairie\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable incident was reported from Russia in 1878:\r\n\r\n“A detachment of Gen. Lazeroff’s expedition against the Turcomans met\r\nwith a curious misadventure near the Georgian town of Elizavetopol. A\r\nfew versts from the town the soldiers encountered an army of locusts\r\nabout 20 miles long and broad in proportion. The officer in charge did\r\nnot like to turn back, repelled by mere insects. The soldiers soon\r\nwere surrounded. The locusts appear to have mistaken them for trees\r\nand swarmed by the thousands around them—crawling over their bodies,\r\nlodging themselves in their helmets, penetrating their clothes and\r\nknapsacks, filling the barrels of their rifles and boring into their\r\nears and noses.\r\n\r\n“The commander gave the order for the troops to push on the\r\ndouble-quick for Elizavetopol, but the road was so blocked that the\r\nsoldiers became frightened and, after they wavered a few minutes, a\r\nstampede took place. Led by a non-commissioned officer who had espied a\r\nvillage a short way from the road, the troops dashed across the fields,\r\nslipping about on the crushed and greasy bodies as if on ice. They\r\nwere detained prisoners by the insects for 45 hours, and on the way to\r\nElizavetopol found every blade of grass and green leaf destroyed.”\r\n\r\nThat same year a cross-continental train was held up for three hours\r\nnear Reno, Nevada, by a host of locusts that covered the rails for\r\nseveral miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trees Can Grow Smaller_\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees change size from hour to hour. The circumference of a tree trunk\r\ngets bigger and smaller with unpredictable perversity. For light on\r\nthis phenomenon the world is indebted to Dr. John A. Small of Rutgers\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nAbout a decade ago tree scientists were provided with an instrument\r\nwhich could measure continuously the radial growth of a tree with an\r\naccuracy of a thousandth of an inch. With such an instrument it seemed\r\nplausible that it would be possible to tell just how much a tree had\r\ngrown in a single day and its rates of growth in different seasons.\r\nA lot of the conclusions reached in this connection must now be\r\ndiscarded. The circumference of a tree certainly changes but not in a\r\nstraight line. It may be bigger one day, smaller the next.\r\n\r\nDr. Small’s experiments were carried out with the white ash. He found\r\nthat circumference changes followed yearly, monthly and even daily\r\nrhythms but the changes in the same tree might vary by as much as\r\n200 percent when measurements were made at different times. Daily\r\nvariations have shown a tendency to reach maximum readings about 6:30\r\na.m. and sink to minimum in the late afternoon or early evening.\r\nEccentric jumps and drops can be found almost any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Underworld Cities_\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventeen-year locusts build great subterranean “cities” during their\r\nlong sojourn in the earth’s depths. The years underground are by no\r\nmeans a resting period—an episode of being buried alive. All the time\r\nthe young locusts, in various metamorphoses, are busy building and\r\neating. The eggs of the strange insects are laid during a few weeks\r\nlate in summer inside twigs. From these eggs come minute nymphs, which\r\nat once make their way into the ground. There they shed their shells\r\nand grow rapidly. Their food is juice sucked from roots. They make\r\nsuccessive mud dwellings attached to these roots. The largest observed\r\nin the eastern United States were eighteen inches below the surface.\r\nEach was a rough ball of earth about two inches long and three-fourths\r\nof an inch wide. The ball is lined on the inside by smooth mud and\r\ncontains only one nymph. Every time an individual moults and grows\r\nlarger it must make a new house.\r\n\r\nWhen they emerge from the last of their feeding chambers, the locusts\r\ndig rapidly upward and construct a somewhat different type of dwelling\r\nsome inches below the surface. These are two-chambered, with upper and\r\nlower rooms connected by tunnels five to ten inches long. These are\r\nso ingeniously constructed, according to Dr. E. A. Andrews of Johns\r\nHopkins University, that they provide “the advantage of safety along\r\nwith quick access to the surface when the proper time comes. In the\r\nshaft the nymph climbs close to the surface or falls rapidly to the\r\nbottom to escape attacks. The lining of the shaft is smooth mud a few\r\nmillimeters thick. The shafts are by no means always straight or of\r\nuniform diameter, but may be sinuous and present swollen regions.” In\r\none area examined he found at the topsoil was such a mass of small\r\nstones and roots that the insects must actually have cut their way\r\nthrough roots. Large obstacles often were avoided by a change in\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n“The chief implements used in making cavities in the earth”, according\r\nto Dr. Andrews' report, “are the big first legs. Here, as in other\r\nlegs, the end segment is used chiefly in walking and may be folded\r\ndown when not needed. The second segment from the tip is used to pick\r\noff particles of earth. The third segment is the largest and, like a\r\npowerful thumb, acts with the opposing second segment as a forceps to\r\npick up pellets of earth and small stones. The minute particles picked\r\nloose from the earth are raked together by the tip segment to make a\r\npellet, which the forceps can carry or shove into the walls of the\r\ncavity. However, all parts of the body may come into use, for the hind\r\nlegs and the abdomen may help shove earth aside and the head may carry\r\nearth plastered upon it. In vertical tunnels the animal braces its legs\r\nagainst the sides and, if disturbed, relaxes and drops down.”\r\n\r\nThe last dwelling is large enough for the nymph to turn around\r\ninside and usually has a flattened floor. The top comes quite close\r\nto the surface without actually breaking through, leaving only a\r\nfew millimeters of earth through which the insect must dig when the\r\ntransmutation to an adult locust takes place. Examination of many\r\nof these tubular dwellings shows that there are no interconnections\r\nbetween them. Each has its own individual exit and along its course\r\navoids contact with other chambers, although they often are very close\r\ntogether. This last home of the locust, before it emerges from the\r\neverlasting darkness to the world of light and quick death which is its\r\npre-ordained destiny, is not necessarily restricted to the earth but\r\nmay be contained above the surface. Aerial extensions may, in fact,\r\nbe abundant and are in the form of turrets, towers, cones, chimneys,\r\nhuts and adobe houses. The walls are of dense mud, not natural soil.\r\nExternally they are made of tiny mud pellets, but lined internally with\r\nthe same smooth layer found in the underground dwellings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plants That Create Mirages_\r\n\r\n\r\nAn explorer in the desolate heights of the Santa Marta mountains in\r\nnortheastern Colombia, fog-wrapped and 10,000 feet above sea level, may\r\nsee a flock of sheep grazing placidly among rocks ahead of him. Then,\r\nlooking the other way, he may see an assembly of cowled, robed priests,\r\napparently in the midst of some weird ecclesiastical ceremony. But when\r\nhe reaches the places where he thought he saw these things there are\r\nneither sheep nor priests. He finds instead two strange varieties of\r\nthe aster family, both among the real curiosities of the plant kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable sheep are bushy plants which grow on nearly barren ground\r\nnear the mountain tops. The individual plant consists of thickly\r\nbranched stems, about the size of a human finger, bearing many layers\r\nof leaves covered with wool-like hairs. Sometimes these leaves are so\r\nthick that the point of a pencil cannot be thrust through them. Some of\r\nthe plants may be as large as a living-room sofa.\r\n\r\nThe extreme compactness of these plants and their dense covering of\r\nhairs is an adaptation to the hostile conditions under which they must\r\nlive. The habitat consists of rocky slopes where the hot, dry winds\r\nof summer and the snows, low temperature and violent gales of winter\r\nexpose them to a perpetual alternation of desert and Arctic conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the same general region are the monk plants, belonging to a\r\ndifferent family, who have responded in the same way to similar\r\nconditions. Seen from a distance on a mountainside, especially\r\nthrough a light fog, a patch of these plants looks decidedly like a\r\ncongregation of several hundred priests.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable sheep also are found in New Zealand, but there are no\r\nknown intermediaries between the closely similar species growing on\r\nopposite sides of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Octopus Worm: Evolution’s Mystery_\r\n\r\n\r\nWorms that give birth to their own grandchildren, animals that have\r\nno digestive, muscular, nervous, glandular or excretory organs—such\r\nparadoxical creatures are the “dicyemid mosozoans”, tiny worms that\r\nlive inside octopuses. These little worms are among the most curious\r\nliving things in nature. It is quite uncertain whether they are a step\r\nupward in evolution from the single-celled protozoans or, like some\r\nother worms, a degenerate form of many-celled animals. It might be\r\nmaintained that they represent a distinct branch of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe body of a dicyemid consists of a single cell, almost half an inch\r\nlong, in the form of a hollow tube, surrounded by a layer of small\r\ncells. The immediate offspring are formed and, in some cases, live\r\ntheir entire lives and reproduce in turn, inside one of these “skin”\r\ncells. The grandchildren break through the body of the grandparent at\r\nany place they choose, apparently without causing any wound, and live\r\nfor a short time as free-swimming animals until they find an octopus\r\nwhose kidneys they can enter. Then the whole life cycle starts over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nApparently the infestation in no way injures the octopus and the worms\r\nare of no practical importance in the world. Each kind of octopus\r\nor squid in coastal areas has its own particular species of these\r\nparasites of which about 35 kinds are known.\r\n\r\nThe worm’s body contains no organs, tissues or glands in the usual\r\nsense of the word.\r\n\r\nBefore being born the larvae attain their full complement of body\r\ncells, are able to swim about, and have within them the germ cells that\r\nwill give rise to the next generation. Birth is very simple. The larvae\r\njust push out, or are squeezed out, through the sides or ends of their\r\nparent at almost any point. The parent continues to develop and bear\r\nmore larvae in the same manner. The number developing at any one time\r\nin the cell may range from one or two to 100 or more.\r\n\r\nThese larvae remain in the octopus as fully developed worms. But at\r\ncertain times the germ cells develop into much smaller individuals,\r\ncalled infusorigens, hard to distinguish from large protozoa. These\r\nnever leave the birth cell inside the parent, but produce germ cells\r\nof their own which develop into free-swimming creatures known as\r\ninfusoriforms. These break away from the grandparent worm and from the\r\noctopus and become free-swimming animals. They are microscopic, less\r\nthan a 300th of an inch long. They live from three days to a week. Here\r\nmay be the borderline between single-celled and multi-celled animals—or\r\nperhaps the greatest degeneration in animal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Monster Bear of Kamchatka_\r\n\r\n\r\nA gigantic black bear, probably the largest of flesh-eating animals,\r\nlives in the dense, hardly explored pine forests of southern Kamchatka.\r\nThis creature still is unknown to science. So far as known it never has\r\nbeen seen by a white man. There is, however, considerable evidence for\r\nits existence presented in a report made several years ago by Dr. Sten\r\nBergman of the State Museum of Natural History at Stockholm, who spent\r\ntwo years on the Kamchatka peninsula.\r\n\r\nPhotographs have been taken of this animal’s footprints in the snow.\r\nIt leaves a track 15 inches long and ten inches wide. Dr. Bergman was\r\nshown a pelt of the giant bear. It was the largest bearskin he ever\r\nhad seen, deep black in color, and covered with short hair in striking\r\ncontrast to the long hair of other Kamchatkan bears. He also saw a\r\ngigantic bear skull, the teeth of which indicate that it belonged to a\r\nyoung individual.\r\n\r\nApparently this Kamchatkan black bear exceeds in size the Kodiak\r\nIsland bear, which lives across Bering Strait and is the largest\r\nknown flesh-eating mammal. The wildness of the country and its dense\r\nvegetation have protected the giant bear from naturalists and hunters.\r\nThe whole land is a veritable paradise for bears who hide away in the\r\ndense thickets along the Kamchatkan rivers and subsist on the abundant\r\nsalmon. They are so numerous that a native does not dare venture into\r\nthe bush in summer without first shouting to let the bears know he is\r\ncoming. They will keep out of a man’s way if they are warned, but are\r\nlikely to attack him if surprised.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the Kamchatkan bears are relatively small\r\nanimals, comparable to those of northern Europe. Some are black, but\r\nthe majority are yellowish-white or light brown. The giant animal may\r\nbe an extreme variation of this race, or may represent an entirely\r\ndifferent species. He naturally is the subject of much native\r\nlegendary. Some stories have been interpreted as indicating that\r\nmammoths existed within the time of man in the northern wildernesses of\r\nboth hemispheres, but such a giant bear would fit the descriptions as\r\nwell as would a small elephant-like creature.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the great numbers of smaller bears, man scarcely\r\ncould subsist in this country. There are, for example, no roads through\r\nthe desolate land between the villages. But all along the rivers and\r\nthrough the forests are well-marked paths made by the bears who seem to\r\nhave an engineering instinct in choosing the most logical places for\r\ncrossing morasses and mountains. These paths are about the only means\r\nof human communication and eventually, if the land ever is settled,\r\nwill become the roads. In the same way elephant trails in Africa and\r\nIndia and bison trails in the United States became the hard-surfaced\r\nhighways of today. Engineers hardly can improve on the instinct of the\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe small bears also play an important part in the domestic economy\r\nof the few inhabitants. The thick, warm pelt is used as a bed. Out of\r\nthe skin the natives make reins, snowshoes and dog traces. The meat is\r\nmuch appreciated. In remoter parts of the country the linings of the\r\nintestines are used for windows instead of glass. Many of the native\r\nmedicines are derived from the bear.\r\n\r\nBoth among the Kamchatka natives and the Ainu of northern Japan the\r\nanimal is revered as a god—the concept being that the great celestial\r\nbear out of his benevolence to men provides creatures in his own form\r\nto furnish them food and clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strange Denizens of the Deep_\r\n\r\n\r\nMost fearsome of all sharks in appearance is Isistius braziliensis,\r\nfound in the tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. It is a\r\nwine-brown colored creature with sharp teeth set in 20 rows which glow\r\nat night with an unearthly light.\r\n\r\n“When the specimen, taken at night, was removed into a dark apartment\r\nit afforded a very extraordinary spectacle,” relates naturalist F. D.\r\nBennett. “The entire inferior surface of the body and head emitted a\r\nvivid, greenish phosphorescent gleam, imparting to the creature, by its\r\nown light, a truly ghastly and terrible appearance. The luminous effect\r\nwas constant and not perceptibly increased by agitation or friction.\r\n\r\n“When the shark expired, which was not until it had been out of the\r\nwater more than three hours, the luminous appearance faded entirely\r\nfrom the abdomen and more gradually from other parts, lingering longest\r\naround the jaws and on the fins. The only part of the under surface\r\nof the animal which was free from the luminosity was the black collar\r\naround the throat.”\r\n\r\nOne of the sea’s strangest denizens is the bramble shark. It is a shark\r\nof medium size whose body is almost completely covered with short,\r\nsharp spines. This fantastic creature apparently is widely distributed\r\nthrough the Atlantic and Pacific, but it is not likely to come into the\r\nhands of collectors. Its general flabbiness stamps it as a deep water\r\nanimal and the anomalous position of its fins indicates that it is a\r\nweak swimmer. Its spiny armament obviously is designed for protection.\r\n\r\nEntirely harmless, it is probable, are the giant “basking sharks”,\r\nwhich sometimes reach a length of forty feet. When encountered they\r\nrarely, if ever, try to defend themselves but attempt to escape by\r\nswimming slowly away. Stories that this monster dives when harpooned\r\nand sometimes will drag a small boat with its crew to the bottom now\r\nare discredited. Although it reigns as a monster among sharks it is not\r\nactually as dangerous as the common dogfish shark.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most dangerous are the so-called “carchaodons”, found in\r\nmost warm seas although nowhere in abundance. They are among the most\r\npowerful and voracious of fishes, but still far less frightful than\r\ntheir fossil ancestors. The latter were the largest of all fishes; they\r\nwere probably twice the length of the largest basking or whale sharks.\r\nSome were more than 88 feet long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Communism Among the Bees_\r\n\r\n\r\nHoney bees have achieved an ideal communistic state. All the 50,000 or\r\nmore members of a family—all progeny of a single queen—share and share\r\nalike. A single sample of sugar or nectar brought into the hive by a\r\nforager is participated in by all the bees. Thus all get essentially\r\nthe same diet. They all acquire a common odor by which they can\r\nrecognize each other. This odor constitutes a “scent language” which is\r\nthe basis of the extremely complex bee social life.\r\n\r\nThese observations, based on experiments with radioactive sugar, are\r\nreported by Dr. Roland Ribbands of Cambridge University. In one of\r\nthese experiments, Dr. Ribbands reports, “a marked bee is trained to\r\ncollect sugar solution from a small glass tube, and when radioactive\r\nsugar is substituted the bee continues to collect the radioactive syrup\r\nquite happily. It returns to the hive and what happens to the labeled\r\nsugar can be followed quite easily. Every bee that receives some can\r\nbe spotted by means of a Geiger counter. By collecting a sample of\r\nbees from the hive, one can discover what proportion of the colony has\r\nacquired some of the sugar. One stomachful can be shared among almost\r\nall the bees of a large colony. The experiments indicate that this\r\nsharing is a random affair. The sugar is passed on irrespective of the\r\nrecipient’s age or occupation.”\r\n\r\nBuilding up of a colony odor through universal sharing of the food\r\nsupply enables members of the colony to recognize each other. This\r\napparently makes little difference when food is abundant but becomes of\r\ngreat importance in periods of scarcity.\r\n\r\n“At those times of the year,” Dr. Ribbands points out, “when there are\r\ninsufficient flowers to provide all the bees with food, they often\r\ntry to steal the honey stored in other colonies. Then the ability to\r\nrecognize hive mates and to distinguish them from other honey bees will\r\nenable a colony to defend itself against attempts at robbery.\r\n\r\n“However, the honey bee community does not defend itself by attacking\r\nevery invader that does not possess the community odor. Strangers are\r\nattacked only under certain circumstances. In order to investigate\r\nthese circumstances two colonies of differently colored bees were\r\nplaced close together, with their entrances only two inches apart,\r\nso that bees often went into the wrong colony by mistake. When good\r\nsupplies of nectar were available, the intruders were allowed to enter\r\nthe strange colony, but when nectar was short the strangers were\r\nattacked and thrown out, often being killed in the process.\r\n\r\n“Production of a common and distinctive odor which enables the colony\r\nto defend itself against members of other communities is a very\r\nimportant consequence of the habit of food-sharing. Better sharing\r\nmeans better defense and so a greater likelihood that the community\r\nwill be able to survive and perpetuate its kind. The habit plays the\r\nkey role in the system of communication which enables the new forager\r\nto learn about suitable crops, in that the new recruit always receives\r\na sample of the crop the colony is working. The first flight becomes a\r\nsearch for a crop with a similar scent. The habit enables the worker\r\nbees in a colony to be apprised of the presence of their queen. A\r\nsubstance derived from her body is conveyed from bee to bee in the\r\nshared food, and in the event of any deficiency in the substance they\r\ntake steps to rear another queen.\r\n\r\n“In addition, it probably helps to ensure an effective division of\r\nlabor in the colony, which has to be so integrated that a suitable\r\nproportion of the worker population carries out each of the various\r\ntasks necessary for maintenance of the colony.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Candles on Bushes_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn parts of Colombia candles in the form of white, wax-like berries\r\ngrow on bushes. These berries produce oil of such excellent quality\r\nthat it is used almost exclusively for altar lamps in Catholic churches\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe berries grow abundantly on a jungle plant with leaves like those\r\nof rhubarb. In only one part of the country is the plant cultivated.\r\nIt is a crop of the semi-hostile Paez Indians. Harvesting is somewhat\r\ndifficult because the oil-containing white seed is inside a burred\r\ncoat. This must be removed and the seeds placed in hot water. The oil\r\nrises to the surface where it can be skimmed off.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to make candles a dozen or more berries are strung\r\non a stick. Such a candle gives off a beautiful, soft light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Desert Rat Manufactures Water_\r\n\r\n\r\nAll animals require water in their bodies, but some can get it without\r\nactually drinking. The desert rat which lives among the bare sand\r\ndunes of California’s Death Valley, can get along indefinitely without\r\nwater and with only dry barley seeds for food. In spite of this about\r\n65 percent of its body weight is water. Most of the water is actually\r\nmade in the animal’s body. The rat’s digestive processes extract the\r\nhydrogen contained in the barley seeds and combine it with oxygen in\r\nthe air to create water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caste System of the Termite_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oldest civilization on earth is that of the termites. The\r\nsuper-organization which these blind white creatures of the dark have\r\nachieved precedes by thousands of millenia those of the ants and the\r\nbees. Termites have a far longer history on earth, being considered\r\nmodifications of the ancient cockroaches who were among the first\r\ninsects to leave any traces of their existence on land. Cockroaches\r\nswarmed in the club moss forests at least 250,000,000 years ago. The\r\ntermite order is at least 30 million years old; some of its most\r\nprimitive forms still are alive.\r\n\r\nIn most of the approximately 2,000 species of termites which have\r\nbeen identified all over the world there are five castes, apparently\r\ndetermined from birth although not so rigidly as among ants. First are\r\nthe winged males and females with large brains and eyes and hard, dark\r\nshells. These depart in great swarms from the ancestral nest once or\r\ntwice a year, usually in spring and fall. They are feeble flyers and\r\ndepend chiefly on transportation by air currents. The majority are\r\neaten by birds. The few surviving pairs from such a flight excavate\r\ncells in the earth or in wood and start new colonies. There is at least\r\none king and one queen in each cell. Sometimes there are two or more\r\npair. They remain partners for life. Both are imprisoned within the\r\ncell. Before entering it they slough off their wings, which henceforth\r\nwould be worthless.\r\n\r\nThe termite queen becomes an inert, egg-laying machine, sometimes the\r\nsize of a small potato. In some species she lays an average of sixty\r\neggs a minute, or 80,000 a day. She may live as long as ten years.\r\nThus each queen ideally produces about a half billion new individuals.\r\nHer bulk increases as much as 50-fold in adult life—about the most\r\nphenomenal growth in nature.\r\n\r\nThe second termite caste, for which there is no parallel among the\r\nants, consists of both males and females with only rudiments of wings,\r\nless fully developed reproductive organs, and somewhat smaller eyes and\r\nbrains. They presumably serve only as an auxiliary royalty, functioning\r\nin case the true rulers die. Apparently by some subtle alchemy known\r\nonly to termites they can be transformed into fully functioning sexual\r\nindividuals if an emergency arises.\r\n\r\nA third caste is made up of smaller insects with extremely minute\r\neyes and brains and barely discernible reproductive organs. Below\r\nthem come the entirely unpigmented, soft-bodied workers with still\r\nsmaller eyes and brains—usually, in fact, with no eyes at all. These\r\nstill are potentially males and females, in distinction to any society\r\nwhere all workers and soldiers are female. Lowest in the scale are the\r\nbig-headed, blind soldiers, also of both sexes, with barely a trace of\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nRelative numbers in these castes differ from species to species. An\r\nanalysis of an Australian termite colony accounted for 1,560,500\r\nworkers, 200,000 soldiers, and 44,000 potentially reproductive\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shark That Stands Upright_\r\n\r\n\r\nMonster of Gulf of Mexico waters is a shark which weights from ten to\r\ntwelve tons and is from 30 to 50 feet long. Largest of its ancient\r\nfamily and an entirely inoffensive creature, this strange animal\r\nliterally stands upright while feeding.\r\n\r\nOn a recent trip a U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service ship encountered\r\nseveral large schools of black-finned tuna. In the middle of each\r\nschool was a large object which looked like a barrel. This object was\r\nthe snout of a whale shark.\r\n\r\nThe creature kept opening its enormous mouth two or three inches below\r\nthe surface. From 50 to 100 gallons of water would flow into the mouth\r\nand be strained out through the gills. This water was full of larval\r\ncrustaceans, or banded shrimps, about a half-inch long.\r\n\r\nIn each observed case the body of the shark stood vertically. Why each\r\nshark should select a school of tuna and put itself almost precisely in\r\nthe center of the swarming fish is a complete mystery. It does not eat\r\ntuna, except possibly very small ones. Presumably, however, it feeds\r\non about the same sort of material as the fish. It knows there is food\r\nwhere the tuna congregate.\r\n\r\nThe whale shark is among the most mysterious of the larger sea animals.\r\nIt is a solitary creature, seldom seen. Its tiny teeth are only about\r\none fifteenth of an inch long and it is supposedly entirely a feeder on\r\nplankton, the minute organisms which abound in sea water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dead Man’s Vine_\r\n\r\n\r\nA semi-legendary plant in Colombia is the ayahuasco or dead man’s vine.\r\nFrom it Indians make a brew which, it is claimed, is quite similar to\r\nthe imaginary drug by which Dr. Jekyll split the good and evil elements\r\nof his character. When a medicine man first gulps the brew—this is\r\nan ethnological report which the botanists cannot confirm—he turns\r\ndeadly pale, trembles in every limb, and the expression on his face is\r\none of intense pain and horror. This is followed in about a minute by\r\na reckless fury in which he seizes whatever lies at hand and starts\r\nbeating the trees and ground. In about ten minutes the excitement\r\nleaves him and he falls to the earth, completely exhausted. There are\r\nnot as yet any scientific accounts of the plant’s influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Insect With Fourteen Lives_\r\n\r\n\r\nA pinhead-sized wormlike larva of a louse may possess one of life’s\r\nultimate secrets—an elixir of controlled growth.\r\n\r\nThe strange ways of life of hormophis hamamelidid—which goes through\r\nfourteen different life stages in the course of a year’s lifetime—are\r\nbeing studied by scientists in the hope of isolating a mysterious\r\nsomething which may open the door of some of the greatest paradoxes of\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\nThe insect is an aphis which causes galls, growths comparable to\r\nanimal cancers, on witch hazel leaves. These growths result when the\r\naphis injects into the leaf by means of a microscopic apparatus like a\r\nhypodermic needle an infinitesimally minute amount of an unidentified\r\nsubstance. The gall grows around and over the insect. It becomes the\r\ntiny creature’s home.\r\n\r\nThe substance completely changes the nature of the plant cells. They\r\nnormally would become leaf cells, highly specialized to fit into\r\nleaf growth. Now they become gall cells. Something similar happens\r\nin cancer, except that the new cell growth, having escaped from the\r\ngovernment of the animal body, is entirely uncontrolled. The gall\r\ncells, however, still remain under some sort of control. They always\r\nform galls and they do not kill the leaf, which is necessary for their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nMarvelous is the life story of the aphis itself. The sequence starts\r\nwith a “stem mother”, a newly hatched female. She injects the substance\r\ninto the leaf and the house builds itself around her. Inside this house\r\nshe passes through four stages. Her structure changes completely four\r\ntimes. That is, she becomes in a sense four different animals, one\r\nafter another. In the fourth stage she gives birth to from fifty to a\r\nhundred living young.\r\n\r\nEach of these young, in turn, goes through four stages. In the last\r\nof these they have wings. The winged insects crawl out through a hole\r\nin the bottom of the gall. Each produces from ten to twenty young on\r\nthe bottom of the leaf. Each of the young, in turn, goes through five\r\nstages. During the last they are both males and females. This is the\r\nonly time the male makes its appearance in the life cycle. All the\r\nother births are by parthogenesis.\r\n\r\nEach of the females lays eggs in the winter on the witch hazel. The\r\nbuds are destined to become leaves in the early Spring. The eggs\r\nhatch a few days before the leaves appear. Each of the newly hatched\r\naphids—all females—injects some of the house-building material into the\r\nleaf upon which she finds herself. She becomes a new “stem mother” and\r\nthe strange process starts all over again.\r\n\r\nThe rapid reproduction rate might well be overwhelming to the witch\r\nhazels, and consequently suicidal for the insects, except for certain\r\nenemies which keep down the numbers of the “lice”. Such tiny forms of\r\nlife as larval lacewings are able to crawl through the hole in the\r\nbottom of the gall and feed on the occupants during their various\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Virginia biologists who have been giving particular\r\nattention to the aphis are interested primarily in the substance\r\ninjected into the leaves. It must be one of the most potent growth\r\nfactors in nature. The amount any one aphid is able to inject is\r\nindescribably minute, even though some of them make as many as 50\r\nseparate injections. The material causes the leaf cells to become\r\nlarger and to multiply much more rapidly until a “house” many times the\r\nsize of the aphis is complete in a few days. The structure is perfect,\r\neven including a “picket fence” of tiny hairs around its base to keep\r\nout invaders.\r\n\r\nThe substance exists in such minute amounts that thus far it has been\r\nimpossible to isolate it in anything approaching a pure form. The\r\nVirginia biologists have set themselves a task requiring infinite\r\npatience over many years—tracing the increase of the amount in the\r\nsalivary glands of each individual through each of its fourteen lives,\r\nand also through the eggs with which the strange life cycle starts.\r\n\r\nThe present clues indicate that the substance is a filterable\r\nvirus—tiniest of living things compared with which the pinhead-sized\r\naphis is like a whale compared to a fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shyness Characteristic of Giant Rats_\r\n\r\n\r\nBiggest of the extant true rats is the giant rat of Liberia. It is two\r\nfeet or more in length and is similar in appearance to the Norway rat\r\nwhich infests houses all over the world. Fortunately this creature\r\nnever has invaded the homes of men. It is a shy animal of the cane\r\nbrakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nocturnal Potto_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the weirdest of living mammals is the potto—“ghost monkey”, of\r\nWest African jungles. It is about the size of a squirrel, with soft,\r\nyellow fur and protruding yellow eyes which shine like malevolent witch\r\nlights in the darkness of the jungle nights. The potto is a nocturnal\r\nanimal of the tree tops. Its weird, whimpering cries are believed by\r\nnatives to be the voices of evil spirits. The little creature is an\r\naberrant member of the family of lemurs, ancient offshoots of the same\r\nfamily from which sprang the monkeys and great apes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Where Trees are Square_\r\n\r\n\r\nA few miles north of the Panama Canal Zone is “the valley of square\r\ntrees.” This is the only known place in the world where trees have\r\nrectangular trunks. They are members of the cottonwood family. Saplings\r\nof these trees now are being grown at the University of Florida to find\r\nout if they retain their squareness in a different environment. It is\r\nbelieved, however, that the shape is probably due to some unknown but\r\npurely local condition. That the cause is deep-seated is indicated by\r\nthe fact that the tree rings, each representing a year’s growth, also\r\nare square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lamp That is a Beetle_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant animal luminescence known is that of the carbuncle\r\nbeetles of Puerto Rico. They emit a light so brilliant that one or two\r\ninside an inverted tumbler illuminate a room of moderate size so that\r\none can read a newspaper at night. Fields are illuminated brilliantly\r\nevery night by these beetles, flying about a foot above the ground. The\r\nlight is not intermittent, and seems nearly continuous. It varies from\r\nyellow to green for different species; occasionally it is yellowish-red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rainstorms of Worms_\r\n\r\n\r\nRains of worms often have been reported. After a summer shower surfaces\r\nof puddles sometimes will be found covered with countless thread worms\r\nor nematodes. These worms have just come out of the bodies of water\r\nbeetles and other insects, where they have developed as parasites.\r\nBefore the shower the insects were dormant. These little worms in farm\r\nwatering troughs led to the long-held belief that horsehairs sometimes\r\nchanged into worms.\r\n\r\nThis does not, however, explain the following report in the _Levant\r\nTimes_, an English newspaper published in Constantinople, of August 6,\r\n1872:\r\n\r\n“A letter from Bucharest reports a curious atmospheric phenomenon which\r\nhappened there on the 25th ult. a quarter past nine in the evening.\r\nDuring the day the heat had been stifling and the sky was cloudless. In\r\nthe evening everybody went out walking and the gardens were crowded.\r\nThe ladies were mostly dressed in white, low-necked robes.\r\n\r\n“Toward nine o’clock a small cloud appeared on the horizon and a\r\nquarter of an hour afterwards rain began to fall which, to the horror\r\nof everybody was found to consist of black worms the size of ordinary\r\nflies. All the streets of Bucharest were strewn with these curious\r\nanimals.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Icy Arctic Wonderland_\r\n\r\n\r\nAbundant and fantastic are the creatures of the shallow Arctic sea\r\nbottom. All are invertebrates—worms, sea anemones and a host of other\r\ncreatures—most of whom spend their lives buried in the mud.\r\n\r\nSome of the creatures and their curious ways of life:\r\n\r\nRibbon worms which, when washed ashore, literally tie themselves in\r\nknots, curl up in balls, and secrete bags of mucous around themselves.\r\n\r\nBright green spoon worms about three inches long. These formerly were\r\neaten by Eskimos.\r\n\r\nBillions of small, transparent and essentially invisible arrow worms.\r\nOne species, about a half inch long, apparently is the kangaroo of the\r\nworm world.\r\n\r\nAn important element of the bottom fauna at Point Barrow, Alaska, are\r\nthe lace worms. Hardly a stone in the area does not have at least one\r\nlace or moss patch.\r\n\r\nThere is a delicately peach-colored sea anemone, a bottom-dwelling\r\nanimal remotely related to the coral polyps, which display an amazing\r\nphenomenon, according to a Smithsonian report by Dr. G. E. MacGintie:\r\n“When it was subjected to unfavorable conditions, such as overcrowding\r\nin a pan of water,” he says, “It cast out through the mouth a\r\ntranslucent, white inner lining with transparent, stubby tentacles.\r\nThese tentacles were tiny anemones. If conditions remained adverse more\r\noffspring were cast off, each lot smaller than its predecessor.” That\r\nis, when in trouble the animal spits out babies—presumably an emergency\r\nmeasure for preservation of the species and a way of reproduction not\r\nhitherto recorded. Apparently the same phenomenon occurs in the sea.\r\nPartly-grown specimens of these offspring dredged from the bottom, at\r\nfirst were mistaken for new species. Some of these sea anemones are\r\nquite colorful—one purplish red, one lavender, one lemon-yellow, and\r\none with translucent, peach-colored tentacles.\r\n\r\nNumerically the most abundant animals of the Arctic are the amphipod\r\nfleas which form an important food source for fish and seals. Great\r\nnumbers live on the undersides of ice cakes from which the bearded seal\r\nsweeps them with its whiskers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fish That Live on Land_\r\n\r\n\r\nSiam and Burma are the lands of queer fish—climbing fish, stone-eating\r\nfish, hunting fish, dry-land fish, singing fish and archer fish.\r\n\r\nIn the distant geological past, life on this planet was confined to\r\nthe seas. Eventually some creature belonging to the common ancestry of\r\nterrestrial animals and fish emerged from the water and over a period\r\nof countless generations, established itself on land. Something of the\r\nsame general sort of development may be taking place in Siamese lakes\r\nand rivers today, with a new kind of land animal in the process of\r\nevolution. Currently, two or three species of fish are learning to live\r\nout of water for considerable periods. At least one of them appears to\r\nhave reached the stage where it must breathe air to survive.\r\n\r\nThese evolving dry land fish were studied intensively by the late Dr.\r\nHugh M. Smith, fisheries advisor to the Siamese government for twelve\r\nyears. One is a species somewhat like a perch in general appearance.\r\nIt belongs to a group which has an accessory respiratory organ, perhaps\r\nthe beginning of a lung, situated in a cavity above the gills, by which\r\noxygen may be taken directly from the atmosphere. The gills themselves\r\nappear inadequate to sustain life. The fish probably would drown,\r\nalthough the process would be very slow, if kept too long under water.\r\n\r\nA common method of fishing in Siam is with a spade. Some fish spend as\r\nmuch as four months of each year buried in damp soil. Local fishermen\r\ndig two or three feet deep in the marshes for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Special Language of Bees_\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy of bee language now has advanced to differentiation of bee\r\ndialects. Some years ago Dr. Karl von Frisch of the University of\r\nMunich established the fact that bees actually possessed a means\r\nby which they could communicate with each other and without which\r\nthe remarkable organization within the swarm would have been nearly\r\ninexplicable. Their language consists primarily of signs, like that of\r\ndeaf and dumb persons. Dr. von Frisch reached the point where he could\r\nget some idea of what the bees were talking about and even predict\r\ntheir behavior from their conversation.\r\n\r\nRecently Dr. von Frisch has found that different varieties have quite\r\ndifferent languages, perhaps as far apart as French and German; one\r\nvariety cannot tell what another is discussing. He has gone one step\r\nfurther—to the discovery that the insects probably talk also in sounds\r\nthat are inaudible to the human ear. The audible buzzing is not a means\r\nof communication.\r\n\r\n“There are indications,” he says in a report to the Rockefeller\r\nFoundation, “that sounds, probably in the supersonic range, play a role\r\nin their communications.\r\n\r\n“Physiologically it would be interesting to know how they judge\r\ndistance. Their dances indicate with remarkable exactness the distance\r\nbetween the hive and the feeding place. How do they adjust themselves\r\nto the changing positions of the sun when they use it as a compass?\r\nApparently they have an excellent memory for time, for they seem to\r\nknow that the sun at a certain time will occupy a certain place in the\r\nheavens.”\r\n\r\nDr. von Frisch and his colleagues at the University of Munich are also\r\nmaking an intensive study of the insect eye and the physiology of the\r\ninsect sense of smell. Previous research has shown that worker bees\r\nhave a special scent gland under voluntary control. Only when a good\r\nsource of nectar is found is the fragrance, evidently quite powerful\r\nand attractive to other bees, released. Then it permeates the immediate\r\nneighborhood. It is the bee language equivalent for the word “Here.”\r\nWhen a cruising worker gets a whiff of this odor it knows there is a\r\nplentiful supply of nectar close at hand and starts a search for it.\r\n\r\nBees cannot distinguish red from black, Dr. von Frisch has found.\r\nThis probably is the reason so few red-blossoming plants depend on\r\nthese insects for distributing their pollen. Nearly all red-blossoming\r\nspecies depend on birds and butterflies, both of which are acutely\r\nsensitive to red. One notable exception, however, is the European poppy\r\nwhose brilliant red blossoms carpet the landscape in late Spring. The\r\nGerman experimenter has found that these blossoms are not “red” to the\r\nbee. They possess a color which cannot be described because it cannot\r\nbe experienced by the human eye. The poppy blossoms reflect a great\r\ndeal of the ultraviolet light in sunshine and to this the bee eye is\r\nextremely sensitive. The color must be quite different from any of the\r\nshades at the blue end of the spectrum which are visible to man. To the\r\nbee it is probably somewhat like violet.\r\n\r\nEven the more or less degenerate human nose can be trained to\r\ndiscriminate some of the bee odors that apparently have so much meaning\r\nin the life of the hive. After practising for a few months Dr. N. E.\r\nMcIndoo of the U. S. Department of Agriculture was able to recognize\r\nthe three castes—queens, drones and workers—merely by smelling them.\r\nWith more practice he was able to make even finer discriminations, as\r\nhe reports:\r\n\r\n“The younger the workers the less pronounced is the odor emitted. To\r\nthe human nose the odor from nurse bees and wax generators is much less\r\npronounced than is that from old workers. Workers just emerged from the\r\ncells have a faint, sweetish odor, but lack the characteristic bee odor\r\nand workers removed from the cells just before they begin cutting their\r\nway out omit a still fainter sweetish odor.\r\n\r\n“Old queens have a strong sweetish odor, while that of queens just\r\nemerged from cells is much pronounced as is the bee odor of the\r\nworkers. The majority of old drones have a faint odor while every young\r\ndrone has a stronger one. It is slightly different from that of young\r\nworkers and is less sweetish.\r\n\r\n“All the offspring of the same queen seem to inherit a peculiar odor\r\nfrom her, which becomes the family odor. Apparently each worker emits\r\nan individual odor which is different from that of any other worker.\r\n\r\n“Of all odors, that of the hive is most important. It seems to be\r\nthe most fundamental factor upon which the social life of the colony\r\ndepends, and upon which the social habit perhaps was acquired.”\r\n\r\nTaste discrimination is roughly parallel to that of humans. The bee\r\ncertainly can distinguish the primary tastes, sweet, salty, sour\r\nand bitter. It naturally is keenly sensitive to different degrees\r\nof sweetness, yet some sugars which are extremely sweet to man are\r\ntasteless to the insects. The same is true of such sweeteners as\r\nsaccharin. The bee’s sense of smell also runs parallel to that of man,\r\nboth in the ability to discriminate fine difference in odors and in the\r\nthresholds of sensitivity. This appears to be a very important factor\r\nin the location of nectar-bearing flowers. However, the bee appears\r\nunable to detect an odor from any great distance. It is probably due\r\nto the sense of smell that scout bees are able to locate good feeding\r\ngrounds. After marking them with their own peculiar secreted odor they\r\nreturn immediately to the hive to tell the others about them. The dance\r\nof a returned scout varies in intensity according to the richness of\r\nthe find and the workers who witness it become correspondingly excited.\r\nIf the scout executes only a feeble dance there is only a small exodus\r\nfrom the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Platters of the Sea_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most dreaded of all sea creatures is the venomous sting\r\nray of which there are several hundred species distributed over the\r\nworld, mostly in tropical waters. On the upper side of the tail is a\r\nsaw-toothed bone dagger from two to fifteen inches long which can be\r\ndriven through a man’s leg. The teeth extrude a venom quite similar to\r\nthat of the rattlesnake.\r\n\r\nLargest is the giant sting ray of Australian waters. A full-grown\r\nspecimen weighs about 800 pounds. The fearsome and gruesome bat sting\r\nray of the California coast weighs up to 200 pounds and is quite\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nAll the rays are bottom dwelling animals, leading sedentary lives on\r\nflat, sandy ground. All are carnivorous, devouring smaller fish and\r\nmollusks. Fortunately they are not very aggressive and will flee from\r\nman if given warning. Still, life guard stations along the California\r\nbeaches reported nearly 400 injuries from the creatures in the summer\r\nof 1952.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our Un-American Food_\r\n\r\n\r\nA half dozen vanished civilizations make their contributions to the\r\nAmerican Thanksgiving dinner: onions from ancient Egypt, peas from\r\nEthiopia, parsnips and turnips from ancient China.\r\n\r\nAztec, Maya, the skin-wrapped Cro-Magnon all did their part in the\r\ndarkness of pre-history to make possible the plates which are loaded so\r\nlavishly. They did better than they knew. Very few new vegetables have\r\nbeen introduced in historic times. In many cases little improvement has\r\nbeen made on the products of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe story of potatoes alone contains enough romance and adventure\r\nfor a good-sized novel. Its origin is unknown but its wanderings from\r\nAmerica to Europe and back to America again constitute a fascinating\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nCultivated lettuce never has been found wild. It is believed to have\r\nbeen derived from India or Central Asia. It is one of the oldest\r\nknown vegetables. Herodotus, Hippocrates and Aristotle mention it in\r\nreferences to Greek gardens. Chaucer notes its cultivation in England\r\nin 1340. Sixteen varieties are listed as being grown in American\r\ngardens as early as 1806.\r\n\r\nCelery is a biennial plant native to the marshlands of southern Europe,\r\nNorth Africa and southwestern Asia. It long was considered poisonous\r\nand was not used as food until modern times.\r\n\r\nThe Israelites complained to Moses in the Wilderness because they\r\ncouldn’t have onions to which they had become accustomed during the\r\ncaptivity in Egypt. The cultivated onion probably originated in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n\r\nPumpkins and squashes were grown in America long before white men\r\ncame on the scene. Evidence of both have been found among ruins of\r\nsettlements of the Basket Makers, about the earliest agricultural\r\npeople on this continent. They probably came from Mexico. The Hubbard\r\nsquash came to light in Marblehead, Mass., in 1855. It had been growing\r\nthere for more than 50 years.\r\n\r\nPeas are the oldest known vegetables. They are believed to have\r\noriginated in Ethiopia but to have spread over Europe and Asia long\r\nbefore the dawn of history. They were eaten—perhaps even cultivated\r\nafter a fashion—by men of Europe’s Stone Age. Columbus planted some\r\nin the West Indies in 1493. They spread rapidly among the Indians and\r\nbecame one of the chief crops of the Iroquois.\r\n\r\nThe species from which cabbage is derived grows wild in North Africa\r\nand along the European shore of the Mediterranean. It has been\r\ncultivated for 4,000 years. Greeks and Romans grew it in their gardens.\r\nMost of the American varieties, however, originated in North Europe.\r\n\r\nThe turnip is a native of central and western China. Seed probably was\r\nbrought to America by some of the earliest European settlers.\r\n\r\nThe radish is a native of China and India. It was cultivated by both\r\nthe Greeks and the Egyptians. The parsnip is another Asiatic root crop.\r\nIt first was planted in Virginia in 1690. Only recently has it gotten\r\naway from the home garden to become a commercial crop.\r\n\r\nPopcorn is peculiarly American. In early Spanish writings reference is\r\nmade to a ritual of the Aztecs in which “one hour before dawn there\r\nsallied forth all these maidens crowned with garlands of maize, toasted\r\nand popped, the grains of which were like orange blossoms—and on their\r\nnecks thick festoons of the same which passed under the left arm.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms That Commit Mass Suicide_\r\n\r\n\r\nAn entire generation of worms commits suicide every year. Every\r\nindividual casts off its own head.\r\n\r\nThese worms are a Himalayan variety of naids, fresh water animals\r\nvaguely related to earthworms. They are reddish-brown and seldom more\r\nthan an inch long. The majority of the worms live with their heads\r\nburied in the mud, tail ends waving freely in the air. Upon any alarm\r\ntheir bodies contract leaving no signs of life.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Spring these worms literally lose these heads and die.\r\nCompared with those of most worms, their regenerative powers are quite\r\nfeeble. It is believed that the decapitation is due to the fact that\r\negg-laying is accompanied by such violent contractions of the body that\r\nthe front segments are disconnected.\r\n\r\nEvery few years there is a report from somewhere in the United States\r\nor Europe of enormous numbers of dead earthworms covering the ground.\r\nA correspondent of the British scientific journal, Nature, reported in\r\n1921: “About the middle of March I saw millions of dead worms morning\r\nafter morning on pavements, roads and paths. They were great and small,\r\nyoung and old, of every known species and genus. They lay prone and\r\neven when they were able to reach a grass plot alive they lacked the\r\npower to burrow.” The phenomenon is unexplained. Examination of the\r\ndead worms shows no unusual parasite or evidence of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fish That Survive Freezing_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a realm of “supercooled life.” Its denizens are deep water\r\nfish that live long and happily in temperatures below the freezing\r\npoint of their blood. But whenever one of them comes in contact with\r\neven a single crystal of ice it freezes almost instantly. This strange\r\nphenomenon of marine life has been observed by biologists of the Woods\r\nHole Oceanographic Institute.\r\n\r\nThese particular fish live at the bottom of Hebron fjord in northern\r\nLabrador. The temperature there is about 1.7 below zero centigrade.\r\nSome have been caught, brought to the surface, and then plunged into a\r\nbath of sea water cooled to exactly the same temperature. They survived\r\nfor several hours. When, however, one of them came in contact with\r\nan ice crystal, it froze stiff in a few seconds. The explanation, it\r\nappears, is that these fish normally live below the depth at which it\r\nis possible for ice crystals to form in water.\r\n\r\nVery careful experiments have shown that water can be carried far\r\nbelow its normal freezing point if it is kept entirely motionless\r\nand is absolutely free from minute particles of any sort which\r\nare necessary for the formation of ice crystals. This is about\r\nthe condition that exists at the fjord bottom. Eventually, if the\r\ntemperature is taken lower and lower, such water will solidify, but\r\ninto a form far different from ice. It is noncrystalline and can best\r\nbe compared with glass. But even if this happened in the Hebron fjord\r\nit would not necessarily bother the fish. Their blood presumably would\r\nturn to glass. There would be no breaking of body cells such as results\r\nfrom the swelling of ice crystals. After an indefinite period the\r\nanimals might be brought out of the solid state, if the thawing could\r\nbe accomplished quickly enough, none the worse for their experience.\r\nThis has been accomplished with very minute organisms, but any\r\ntechniques which might be used with higher plants or animals have not\r\nyet been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe extent of life in the supercooled world is unknown. It hardly can\r\nbe confined to fish. All sorts of mollusks, echinoderms and worms also\r\nare bottom dwellers in Arctic and Antarctic waters. It’s not cold, but\r\nice, that kills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plants That Kill_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lethal dose Socrates was condemned to swallow by the\r\nstuffed-shirtism of ancient Athens was d-propyl-piperidine. This is the\r\ndeadly alkaloid in the spotted hemlock, a common European weed which\r\nnow grows extensively over most of the eastern United States. A closely\r\nrelated European species is the cowbane which cows instinctively will\r\nnot nibble.\r\n\r\nThe devastating illness which fell upon 10,000 Greeks of the\r\nAnabasis, Xenophon would have been interested to know, was caused\r\nby andromedotoxin. This is a resinous substance common to plants of\r\nthe heath family the world over. It is the poisonous constituent of\r\nrhododendron, mountain laurel and some kinds of azalgias. Honey from\r\nthe blossoms of plants containing it is extremely poisonous.\r\n\r\nWhen pioneers first pushed their way over the Appalachians their\r\nsettlements were ravaged by epidemics of a fatal disease—milk sickness.\r\nFarms and villages were abandoned as terror-stricken settlers fled\r\nfrom the scourge. It was due to tremetol, a complex chemical which has\r\nbeen found in several plants—chiefly white snakeroot which causes the\r\ndisease east of the Mississippi. When cows eat the snakeroot the poison\r\npasses into the milk.\r\n\r\nBy far the most virulent plant growing in the United States is very\r\nlittle known although it has caused many fatalities. This is the\r\nwater hemlock or cicula—very different from the spotted hemlock whose\r\nextract was forced upon Socrates. It grows in low, swampy places nearly\r\neverywhere. When the ground is soft in the spring its roots can be\r\npulled easily from the soil and have a pleasant odor that attracts\r\nchildren. It causes heavy losses of livestock.\r\n\r\nNext in virulence of all American plants is the whorled milkweed which\r\ncontains a closely allied resinous material not yet satisfactorily\r\nanalyzed. It has caused the death of countless cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caterpillars That Pretend to be Snakes_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are worm-snakes, snake-worms, and wormlike animals that\r\ninstinctively imitate snakes. This is especially true of certain South\r\nAmerican caterpillars—defenseless creatures whose only security is in\r\nmimicry.\r\n\r\nA large, green tree-living caterpillar in British Guiana ordinarily\r\nremains motionless and looks like part of a vine stem. But when the\r\nbranch is shaken it rears the front part of its body and stretches\r\nhorizontally. At the same time it gives a twist expanding its front\r\nsegment into a bulbous enlargement with a big menacing black eyespot\r\nsurrounded by a yellow ring. This it remains for a few minutes, looking\r\nvery much like a poisonous tree snake that lives among green leaves.\r\n\r\nSerpent caterpillars abound in Brazil. The best example is Leucorhampha\r\ntriptolemus, a creature that hangs vertically from stems of plants.\r\nWhen disturbed it twists and shows a front extremely resembling the\r\nhead and back of a snake. The curve of the caterpillar is just like\r\nthat of a serpent. It keeps up a swaying, side-to-side movement for\r\nseveral seconds. The whole effect is to change what seems an innocent\r\nplant stem suddenly into an open-mouthed snake with red jaws and\r\nferocious eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_All Plants Are Luminous_\r\n\r\n\r\nAll green foliage gives off an invisible deep red—almost black—light.\r\nThis phenomenon is one of the most fundamental processes of life. It is\r\nassociated closely with the photosynthesis upon which depends all life\r\non earth. This important discovery was made recently by biologists at\r\nthe Oak Ridge laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission while studying\r\nchanges in a chemical known as adenosine triphosphate in plants engaged\r\nin photosynthesis, the formation of starches and sugars out of hydrogen\r\nfrom the soil and carbon from the atmosphere in the presence of light.\r\nNewly acquired knowledge about the process is paving the way to\r\nimproved agricultural methods.\r\n\r\nThe biologists used extracts from the bodies of fireflies which give\r\noff a bright light when this chemical—an important source of energy\r\nin muscle—is present. Then they found that chloroplasts, the parts of\r\nplants most closely associated with the photosynthetic process, also\r\nwould give off light when mixed with firefly juice and illuminated.\r\nThey then made the unexpected discovery that living extracts of green\r\nplants give off a light of their own without any mixing.\r\n\r\nThe light given off by the chloroplasts now is believed to be the exact\r\nopposite of the first chemical step in photosynthesis. Light absorbed\r\nby the chloroplasts forms unstable chemical bonds within the plant.\r\nA small fraction of these chemically induced compounds recombine.\r\nThe energy liberated by this process is trapped by the chlorophyll\r\nmolecule, which in turn gives off the mysterious light.\r\n\r\nIt has been established that leaves, if frozen while exposed to\r\nillumination, retain their light-producing ability for several months.\r\nIt also has been found that certain extracts prepared from leaves\r\nundergoing exposure to light contain substances which give off a bright\r\nlight when certain chemicals are added to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms That Live in the Snow_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are jet black worms that live in red snow. They come out of their\r\nsnow burrows only during the late summer evening, crawl sluggishly on\r\nthe surface, and disappear at sunrise the next morning. They have been\r\nobserved swimming in shallow pools that form on the surface of the\r\ngreat Malaspina glacier which flows down the slope of Mount St. Elias\r\nin Alaska.\r\n\r\nPresumably during the long sub-Arctic winter these worms burrow deep\r\nin the snow and remain in a torpid state. They subsist chiefly on the\r\nmicroscopic red algae which give the glacial snow fields a reddish\r\ntinge. The black worms themselves are innumerable. They have been\r\nphotographed covering a trail a quarter-mile long at an elevation of\r\n5200 feet in Oregon. They are enchytraeids, relatives of earthworms.\r\nThe common white variety now is raised commercially in vast numbers,\r\non diets of oat meal and sour milk, as food for fancy varieties of\r\naquarium fish. Both worms and insects that normally live in snow fields\r\nare black.\r\n\r\nAn investigator of the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory once\r\nfound a multitude of white enchytraeids in cakes of ice cut from a\r\nMassachusetts pond the previous winter. They were active when the ice\r\nthawed but all died in a few days. The same investigator kept thirty\r\nspecimens of another species in a tumbler of water placed on a ledge\r\noutside his laboratory window. On a cold night the water froze solid\r\nwith the worms in a tangled mass in the center of the ice cake. All\r\nbut three or four were alive and appeared normal when the ice was\r\nthawed.\r\n\r\nAbout 75 years ago housewives of Salina, Kansas, complained that\r\nthe ice delivered from door to door was “wormy.” Cakes were found\r\nhoneycombed with tiny white worms, probably enchytraeids. They swam\r\nabout actively when the ice thawed and infested food stored in\r\nrefrigerators. All died when the temperature reached about 60 F.\r\n\r\nWhether any worm—except possibly the most minute—can survive complete\r\nfreezing is doubtful. They live in little holes that form naturally\r\nwhen water freezes and that are kept open by heat generated by the\r\nbodies of the creatures themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Strange Ways of Snails_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong earth’s deadliest creatures are cone snails which inject into\r\ntheir victims a poison as virulent as that of the rattlesnakes. These\r\nsnail-like animals have a poison-secreting gland in the head and the\r\nvenom is injected through the skin of the victim by tiny, needle-sharp,\r\nharpoon-shaped teeth. It is deadly not only to many kinds of sea\r\nanimals but also to man. The poison, acting on the nervous system, may\r\nin some cases kill in several hours.\r\n\r\nFortunately cone-shells are timid, retiring, slow-moving creatures.\r\nThey are among the loveliest of all sea shells. Most valuable is the\r\n“glory-of-the-seas” cone which is worth several hundred dollars. Of\r\nthe twenty known specimens in the world, only three are in American\r\ncollections. Of the 300 or more known varieties only five or six from\r\nthe Indo-Pacific area are definitely known to be venomous.\r\n\r\nThe “emperor’s top shell” is among the earth’s most exquisite and,\r\nuntil recently the rarest of sea shells. This shell, about five\r\ninches in diameter, belongs to a sea snail of a genus fairly abundant\r\nduring the Mesozioc geological period about 300,000,000 years ago and\r\nsupposedly extinct until about eight years ago when one was found\r\nalive in a Japanese lobster trap. Thereafter the snail was seen very\r\nrarely until the present Emperor of Japan ordered that all specimens\r\nbe preserved for his private collection. Fortunately his interest\r\nencouraged Japanese fishermen to keep a special look-out for the\r\ncreatures and since then they have been found quite frequently. They\r\napparently are distributed around the world in semi-tropical waters.\r\nTwo species have been located in the West Indies and a new one recently\r\nhas been reported in South Africa. The shells are rich golden-orange in\r\ncolor, highlighted with reds and salmons.\r\n\r\nIn the Smithsonian collections are specimens of the “original shell\r\ncollector”—the snail that collects shells. This sea snail, widely\r\ndistributed in tropical waters, has the habit of gluing to its own\r\nshell fragments of the shells of other animals, bits of coral, and\r\nalmost every kind of debris it can pick up. The purpose is not known,\r\nbut it may be for protective camouflage. Seen in shallow water, the\r\ncreature looks like a little pile of broken shells on the sea bottom.\r\n\r\nThere is a “worm snail” that builds great limestone causeways and\r\nbridges. This is the shelled sea-snail of the Mediterranean—Termetus\r\n(wormlike). When the creature is young its shell is a regular spiral\r\nwhich the owner, free to move about, carries on its back and into\r\nwhich it can retreat when alarmed. As the snail ages the shell becomes\r\ntwisted and contorted, like a tube, and is attached to an offshore\r\nrock. The animal crawls inside and soon dies. There are inestimably\r\ngreat numbers of these gastropods. They fix their shell tombs close\r\ntogether. These coil around each other to form solid masses of rock.\r\nQuatrefages, describes them in these words: “In Sicily where calcarous\r\nrocks projected into the sea I found they were surrounded by a kind of\r\ncauseway which, without varying much in width, yet followed all the\r\nsinuosities of the shore almost exactly on a level with the surface of\r\nthe water, filling up narrow chasms in some places and forming solid\r\narchways in others. Thus it afforded a smooth and easy path to one\r\nwho did not object to having his legs washed by the waves. One might\r\nsuppose the white and compact cement had been consolidated by man.”\r\n\r\nThe love life of some snails is confusing to Freudians. Each animal\r\nis provided with a quiver full of arrows, located in the right side\r\nof the neck. These darts can be discharged with considerable force.\r\nThey are straight or curved shafts of carbonate of lime which taper to\r\nexceedingly fine points. During the breeding season the little mollusks\r\nmeet in pairs. A couple will station themselves about an inch apart\r\nand start shooting at each other. Several darts are exchanged and each\r\nfinds its mark. After this love duel the two embrace and, since each is\r\nboth male and female, both lay eggs. The darts presumably were first\r\ndeveloped as defense weapons and, outmoded for service of Mars millions\r\nof generations ago, now have been turned to the service of Eros.\r\n\r\nShowers of snails have been reported intermittently. One of the most\r\nnotable took place back in 1892 at the German town of Padeborn. Late in\r\nAugust a great yellow cloud was seen over the town. In a few minutes\r\nit burst into a torrential rain. Afterwards the pavements were covered\r\nwith water snails, all with shells broken after their long fall from\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nSome snails can bore holes in solid rock. One, found chiefly on the\r\nFrench channel coast near Boulogne, has bored holes six inches deep and\r\nan inch in diameter with a cup-shaped cavity at the bottom. The cavity\r\nis used for the animal’s hibernation.\r\n\r\nA few snails are natural barometers. They reputedly are extremely\r\nsensitive to changes in humidity. One, generally grey, turns yellow\r\njust before a rain and blue afterwards.\r\n\r\nSnails admittedly are very tenacious of life and can endure extremes of\r\nheat, cold and dessication. Many instances have been cited, some nearly\r\nincredible. In 1846, for example, a desert snail from Egypt was fixed\r\nto a paper tablet in the British Museum in London. Four years later\r\nit was observed that he had discolored the paper in his attempt to\r\nget away. Finding escape impossible he had again retired. This led to\r\nhis immersion in tepid water. The creature again came to life. He was\r\n“alive and flourishing” a week later.\r\n\r\nThere are snail harpists and even singing snails. The former were\r\ndescribed by Rev. H. G. Barnacle, British missionary-naturalist, in a\r\nscholarly paper written in 1848: “When up in the mountains of Oahu, I\r\nheard the grandest but wildest music as from hundreds of aeolean harps\r\nwafted to me on the breeze and a native told me it came from singing\r\nshells. It was sublime. I could not believe it but a tree close at\r\nhand proved it. Upon it were thousands of the snails. The animals drew\r\nafter them their shells which grated against the wood and so caused the\r\nsounds. The multitude of sounds produced the fanciful music.”\r\n\r\nThe singing snails in Ceylon’s blackish Lake Batticaloa were described\r\nby the British naturalist Sir Emerson Tennent: “Sounds came up from\r\nthe water like gentle thrills of a musical chord or like the faint\r\nvibrations of a wine glass when the rim is rubbed by a moistened\r\nfinger. It was not one sustained note but a multitude of tiny sounds,\r\neach clear and distinct in itself. On applying the ear to the woodwork\r\nof the boat the vibrations greatly increased in volume. The natives\r\nsaid they were made by singing snails.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vision-Producing Plants_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the plants used by California Indians for food, medicine, and\r\nmagic is wild tobacco. It is smoked in a hollow elder stick, about\r\neight inches long, from which the pith has been removed. A few\r\ninhalations of the smoke early in the morning are enough to overcome\r\nthe smoker so that he is unable to stand on his feet. He inhales until\r\nextreme dizziness is achieved and then he touches tobacco no more\r\nfor the rest of the day. Indians can give no good reason for this\r\nconcentrated form of smoking. It is simply the way of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nA mixture of plants, the honey of bumblebees, and the red scum off an\r\niron spring constitute a popular love charm. The mixture is placed\r\nin a buckskin bag and carried under the arm. When the favor of some\r\nparticular maiden is desired it is necessary only to secure something\r\nassociated with her and add it to the charm. The easiest to get is\r\na pinch of soil upon which the lady has spat. This is used not only\r\nby lovers but also by husbands wishing to secure the return of errant\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nAlmost equally as important as tobacco in the life of these California\r\nIndians is a vision-producing plant closely related to the common\r\ngarden trumpetflower and to the deadly nightshade. The leaves from\r\nthe east side of the plant are smoked; this brings about a state of\r\nexaltation in which various animals are seen to come and offer their\r\nhelp to the dreamer. Leaves from the west side are never smoked. It\r\nwould mean certain death; the Indians associate the west with death.\r\n\r\nMuch the same effect is obtained by drinking a blue-frothy decoction\r\nof the root. It not only produces visions but acts as a powerful\r\nanesthetic. It is highly poisonous, however, and only those Indians\r\nwho know the proper dosage make use of it. The plant is known as\r\n“grandmother,” because of its comfort-bringing qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Abominable Snow Man_\r\n\r\n\r\nMysterious beast of the high Himalayas is the “abominable snow man,”\r\nso-called by natives. It is evidently a four-footed, five-toed mammal\r\nthat weighs from 150 to 200 pounds and lives in family groups. This\r\nmuch, at least, can be deduced from its tracks in the snow, according\r\nto Dr. Edouard Wyss-Dunant, leader of the Swiss Mt. Everest expedition\r\nof 1952. He found the footprints in a snow covered frozen lake at an\r\naltitude of about 15,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tracks are bear-like, the animal apparently has a quite\r\nunbearish ability to leap from crag to crag in migrations from one high\r\nvalley to another. The snow prints were first reported by Himalayan\r\nexplorers to be ape-like, or even almost human, and this led to\r\nspeculations that some still unknown type of big ape might have evolved\r\nin the high mountains.\r\n\r\nThe tracks, says Dr. Wyss-Dunant in his recent report to the Royal\r\nGeographic Society, are undoubtedly those of a large “plantigrade\r\nanimal”—that is, one that walks on the sole of the foot with the heel\r\ntouching the ground. This is the way of both bear and man. The sole of\r\nthe foot is from four to five inches long by the depth of the tracks,\r\ncompared to those made by men of known weights. Some smaller footprints\r\nwere found, believed to be those of young animals. Three of the tracks\r\nshowed imprints of claws. Small triangular markings on the heels of two\r\nof them were attributed to tufts of hair that grows on the bottom of\r\nthe feet.\r\n\r\nTracks of one animal were followed until they came to a rock several\r\nfeet high over which it was necessary for the creature to jump. On the\r\nother side imprints of three feet were found close together. Apparently\r\nthe animal had landed on these three feet. The tracks of the fourth\r\nfoot were some distance ahead, indicating preparations for another\r\njump. Beyond, Dr. Wyss-Dunant picked up other trails. Three were coming\r\nout of a deep valley. The fourth came off the side of a glacier. These\r\npaths joined and thenceforward continued as a single set of tracks. The\r\nanimals apparently step in each others' footsteps while they proceed in\r\nsingle file. This is a customary procedure for mountaineers crossing a\r\nglacier where there is danger of falling into crevasses.\r\n\r\nNepal mountaineers have been familiar with the mysterious tracks for\r\nyears but nobody has been found who claims to have seen the animal.\r\nThey call it a “yeti.”\r\n\r\n“I could find no trace of meals, nor of excrement,” the Swiss explorer\r\ndeclared. “This confirms my opinion that the animal only passes through\r\nand does not frequent these heights. We should at least have found a\r\nplace of refuge, if not a lair, if the yeti was living and hunting in\r\nthe neighborhood. I rather think it passes between adjacent peaks only\r\nwhen, having scoured one valley, it tries to reach another. This animal\r\nis a wanderer, avoiding zones inhabited by man. It probably is not a\r\ncarnivore since there is very little other animal life even in the high\r\nvalleys upon which it could feed. It obviously is an animal of quite\r\nsuperior intelligence to subsist at such high altitudes and to have\r\nkept itself hidden from humans so long.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fish That Sing in the Moonlight_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may be a fish that actually sings—that is, utters melodious\r\nsounds with a perceptible rhythm or beat which can be recorded in\r\nsimple musical notation. This “singing” fish, which nobody actually has\r\nbeen able to identify, is one of the curiosities invariably called to\r\nthe attention of visitors in the Batticoloa province of eastern Ceylon.\r\nIt frequents only one deep lagoon and can be heard when the water is\r\ncalm. Moonlight seems to draw the organism closer to the surface. On\r\ndark, calm nights the music still can be heard, but it seems to be\r\ncoming from greater depths.\r\n\r\nThe “singing” sound at least, is a verifiable fact, according to the\r\nRev. J. W. Lange, a Jesuit priest in Batticoloa who has tried for\r\nseveral years to determine what sort of an organism is responsible.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, he contends, that the sounds are made by something under\r\nthe water. They are heard best when the head is held under the surface.\r\nBy lowering a hydrophone attached to an amplifier into the lagoon, he\r\nwas able, to record the sounds. From this record a friend familiar with\r\nmusical notation was able to put them on paper.\r\n\r\nIt has been established that several species of fish in the lagoon make\r\ndistinctive sounds. One, a large black fish with a yellow belly and\r\nfour whiskers on each side of its face, expresses sounds like a baby’s\r\nfretful crying. A large chocolate-colored fish found among the bottom\r\nrocks makes a sound “like the distant echo of a large firecracker.”\r\nThere is a curious little scaleless fish found in schools of 100 or\r\nmore; as the school moves through the water it produces a chorus of\r\ntinkling sounds. A phosphorescent light comes from inside the throats\r\nof these animals. Among all his catches Fr. Lange has found nothing\r\nwhich can be identified with the singing fish, but he is convinced the\r\nmusic comes from a living organism.\r\n\r\nThat fish can and do make sounds now is well-known. This was\r\ndemonstrated conclusively by U. S. Navy investigators during the late\r\nwar. They determined the characteristic sounds made by a large variety\r\nof sea creatures whose chatter was interfering with underwater sonic\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brazil’s Vicious Glow Worm_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most unusual of all luminous creatures is an insect larva\r\nfound by farmers ploughing damp soil in Brazil and Uruguay. It is a\r\nreddish-brown little worm with rows of green lights on both sides and\r\na vivid red lamp on the front of its head. The red light is actually\r\nred—not white light shining through a reddish skin. Adult females\r\nof the species retain the same luminous pattern. Male adults have\r\nonly feeble, yellow lights. The larva are extremely vicious little\r\ncreatures, predators on white grubs which infest the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grasshoppers Like Chameleons_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a jet-black grasshopper that turns sky-blue at sunrise. The\r\ncurious creature is found on the summit of Mount Kosciusco, highest\r\npeak in Australia, where snow lingers into late summer and nights are\r\nbitter cold.\r\n\r\nThe insect is of peculiar interest because of a temperature control\r\nmechanism otherwise unknown in nature. Several animals, notably\r\nchameleons and some fish, can change color, usually to match their\r\nenvironment. The changes are brought about by certain hormones,\r\nreleased by stimulation of the eyes, which activate different color\r\ncells in the skin. But in this grasshopper every one of the outer layer\r\nof cells of the body is a color cell. On the surface are granules\r\nof black pigment, underneath granules of blue. These change places\r\nin response to temperature changes. At approximately 25 degrees C.\r\nthe blue granules rise to the top, displacing the black. At 15 C.\r\nthe reverse happens. This displacement can be brought about only by\r\ntemperature change. Australian entomologists have in vain tried every\r\nother sort of stimulus, including illumination with various wave\r\nlengths of light.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon probably is protective. Seemingly because it is very\r\ncold at night on the high mountaintop the black pigment absorbs and\r\nretains all the heat available. It is as if the grasshopper carried\r\na woolen blanket. With sunrise an abrupt change takes place; and the\r\ndays often become intensely hot. If the black coat were retained, the\r\ngrasshopper would become overheated and probably die. The blue reflects\r\nmuch of the heat.\r\n\r\nWith the first streaks of sunlight grasshoppers which have slept all\r\nnight at the foot of grass stalks begin creeping slowly upward. There\r\napparently is no nervous control of the color change. Each color cell\r\nseems to act independently. The same reaction takes place in dead\r\ngrasshoppers when the temperature changes, affecting even fragments of\r\ntheir bodies. It is possible to get a grasshopper half black and half\r\nblue by heating one end and cooling the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beetles That Helped an Army_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the invasion of Normandy in 1944 Army jeep drivers prohibited\r\nfrom using headlights of any sort, were able to follow winding country\r\nroads on the blackest nights by rows of millions of flashing green\r\nlights which outlined the roadsides.\r\n\r\nWingless, wormlike female beetles, (Lampyris hoctiluca, the European\r\nglow worm) were trying to attract their winged, lightless mates. Their\r\nnocturnal lovemaking as they clung to roadside weeds and bushes was a\r\nfar from insignificant factor in the Normandy operations. The worms\r\nindicated not only the direction but the width of the roads, thus\r\nforestalling fatal accidents and preventing drivers from going astray\r\ninto hostile territory. However, they doubtless proved of equal value\r\nto the enemy. These accommodating creatures, unknown to soldiers from\r\nacross the Atlantic, should not be confused with our familiar fireflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms in Medical History_\r\n\r\n\r\nEarthworms have an important place in folk medicine, especially in the\r\nNear East. Muzhatu-L-qylut of Hamd Allah, an ancient Persian natural\r\nhistory, states: “Earthworms are red worms living in the damp earth.\r\nBaked and eaten with bread they reduce the size of stones in the\r\nbladder. When dried and eaten they cure the yellowness of jaundice.\r\nIn difficult labor they bring on delivery immediately. Their ashes\r\napplied to the head with oil of roses make the hair to grow.”\r\n\r\nSays a seventeenth century English medical treatise: “Earthworms are\r\nhot of nature and of them are a pressious oyntment made to close\r\nwoundes; and if they be sodden in goose greece and styned it is a good\r\noyntment for to drop into a dull hearing ear. Earthworms stamped are\r\ngood for payned teeth. The oyle of earthworms be greatly commended for\r\ncomforting of sinews, jointes, vaines and goute. They must be washed\r\nin white wine and the oyles of verbascum or cowslopes, of roses, of\r\nlilies, of dil, of chamomill, all sodden together. When it is cold put\r\nin your erthwormes, stoppe your glass, let it stand xl days in the\r\nsunne, then straine it. It will make an excellent oyle against ache,\r\nsciatica, goute, etc.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Toads That Make Poison Gas_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the weirdest of American amphibians are certain of the giant\r\ntoads of southwestern United States and northern Mexico which, when\r\nfrightened or in pain, diffuse a deadly gas which will kill objects\r\nsome distance away.\r\n\r\nA very large toad found almost everywhere throughout the Panama Canal\r\nZone can squirt a poison which may permanently blind a man if it hits\r\nthe eyes. Nobody would bother it except that from its skin is made of\r\nthe softest and most expensive of all leather.\r\n\r\nMost toads have skin covered with warts which are more closely grouped\r\non the sides of the neck than elsewhere. These, together with the\r\nparatoid glands situated behind the eyes, secrete a milky, poisonous\r\nfluid whenever the animal is molested. The secretion is an acid\r\nirritant, causing pain in cuts and producing a bitter, astringent\r\nsensation in the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plants That Thrive on Ice-Bloom_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are plants that grow in ice and snow. This phenomenon—known to\r\nbotanists as cryovegetation—has been the subject of intensive study at\r\nMt. McKinley National Park in Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe plants are responsible for the strange phenomenon of ice-bloom.\r\nIce fields at various seasons take strange colors. The plants are very\r\nminute members of the almost universal algae family which are among\r\nthe most primitive forms of life on earth. They are able to extract\r\nthe nourishment they require from the surface of a glacier as it melts\r\nslightly under the glare of the Arctic sun. The phenomenon has been\r\nreported by Arctic explorers for many years but until a few years ago\r\nvery little was known of the responsible microorganisms. They are a\r\nstriking demonstration of the fact that life has spread to all possible\r\nhabitats on earth in some form or other, even to fields of solid ice.\r\n\r\nWhile nobody is likely to stake out a few thousand acres of glacier for\r\na farm, an Hungarian botanist, Dr. Ersebet Kol, has made first-hand\r\nstudies of the conditions under which the minute plant organism could\r\nlive and multiply, including the acidity of the ice. Concerning the\r\nColumbia glacier, one of the largest in the Alaska ice-fields, Dr.\r\nKol reported to the Smithsonian Institution: “When I stepped on the\r\nice, I saw for the first time a phenomenon to be seen only on coastal\r\nglaciers. The surface of the ice was covered for miles and miles with\r\nlight brownish-purple algal vegetation called ice-bloom. This effect\r\nis produced by immense quantities of minute plants called Ancyclonema,\r\na characteristic plant of the permanent ice. It can never be found\r\nelsewhere, even on permanent snow. It belongs to the green algae\r\nfirst found on the coast glaciers of Greenland. Since that time, the\r\nmicroorganism has been found in several localities in Europe, and I\r\nhave found it occasionally on the glaciers of the interior but never in\r\nsufficient quantities to form the ice-bloom of the coastal glaciers.\r\n\r\n“Here I had an opportunity of studying another striking phenomenon of\r\nthe permanent snow regions of Alaska—colored snow, especially red snow.\r\nAbove Valdez, around the Thompson Pass, the snowfields glitter with a\r\nreddish color in the beginning of August. The snow was red not only\r\non the surface, but also to a depth of several inches and even in one\r\nplace to a depth of two feet, caused by the presence of millions of\r\ntiny plants, Chlamydomonas nivalis. The snow on Thompson Pass looks as\r\nthough it has been sprinkled with red pepper, differing in this respect\r\nfrom the red of other snowfields, which is usually a light raspberry\r\nred.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poison Arrow Frogs_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a green frog, about the size of a half dollar, that is one\r\nof the most virulently poisonous creatures on earth—but only after it\r\nhas been roasted alive. It is common at the Smithsonian Institution’s\r\ntropical wild life preserve in the Panama Canal Zone. When living it\r\nis quite harmless, at least to human beings although some believe it\r\ncan poison other frogs. When it is roasted over a slow fire, however, a\r\ntoxin is exuded from its skin which is a potent nerve and respiratory\r\npoison. It once was used by the Choco Indians to poison the arrows with\r\nwhich they hunted game and Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe poison arrow frog is a delicate creature which is confined to a\r\nnarrow temperature range and probably never has reached the United\r\nStates alive. A ground and tree-dwelling animal, it is quite elusive.\r\n\r\nA close relative is a brilliant scarlet frog, a denizen of the treetop\r\nof the dense Panama rain forest. From its skin also is exuded a\r\nvirulent poison. One of the two jungle canopy frogs, it is less than\r\nan inch long. Its body has deep scarlet both above and below; its feet\r\nare black and its thighs are flecked with metallic green on the rear\r\nand metallic blue on the front. It is found only on the Atlantic side\r\nof the isthmus near the mouth of a small bay where Columbus once landed\r\nfor fresh water. Outside its narrow range the creature has never been\r\nseen in its gorgeous colors. In captivity it probably would die very\r\nquickly. Placed in a preservative, it quickly turns to a drab, uniform\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThe animal is a remarkable and peculiar climber. It ascends a tree\r\ntrunk by a series of short jumps, catching its toes in rough spots on\r\nthe bark. (Other tree frogs have suction disks on their feet by means\r\nof which they can walk up a tree in leisurely fashion.) It makes its\r\nway unerringly from the ground to its treetop home, a pool of water in\r\nthe axil of a bromilead or “tank plant,” a tree of the pineapple family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Seal That Can “Lose” Its Head_\r\n\r\n\r\nAn animal that can pull its head almost completely into its neck has\r\nrecently been added to the mammal collections of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. This is the Ross seal, one of the rarest of all the seal\r\nfamily in the Antarctic.\r\n\r\nA frozen specimen captured by the Navy’s polar expedition in 1956\r\narrived at the U. S. National Museum in Washington in excellent\r\ncondition. This seal—about 8 feet long—dwells exclusively on the\r\ndrifting ice pack of the Ross Sea. So far as is known it never comes\r\non land or on the ice shelf. It apparently feeds almost exclusively on\r\ncuttlefish and squid, which are abundant in Antarctic waters. To judge\r\nby the nature of its teeth it undoubtedly is not a fish-eater. It is\r\nyellowish-green on the underside and blackish-brown on the top, the fur\r\noften being marked with pale streaks along the sides.\r\n\r\nOn the drifting pack it has fearsome enemies—notably the killer whale\r\nand the writhing, snake-like sea-leopard, most savage of the seal\r\nfamily—which may account for its relative scarcity. The outstanding\r\npeculiarity of the creature, probably unique among mammals, is the\r\nthick bloated neck into which the head can be withdrawn. This may be a\r\nprotective characteristic although it could hardly serve the creature\r\nagainst its fierce enemies. On the other hand, withdrawal of the head\r\nmay be a comfortable habit in a very cold climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Delectable Horned Viper_\r\n\r\n\r\nAll along the Nile and the Red Sea coast is found the horned viper\r\nwhich lives buried wormlike in the sand with only its eyes and the\r\nupper part of its head visible. Its horns are said to look like barley\r\ngrains and to entice birds. It is found often in rodent holes. This\r\nhorned viper is extremely tenacious of life. It has been kept alive in\r\na glass jar, without food, for two years. It can hurl itself forward\r\nas much as three feet. A full-grown specimen is about 18 inches long\r\nand quite poisonous but Egyptian magicians have been seen eating the\r\nanimals like stalks of celery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flying Snakes, Frogs and Toads_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are flying snakes as well as flying frogs and toads. Such\r\nreptiles and amphibians should be considered expert parachutists rather\r\nthan actual flyers.\r\n\r\nThe tree snakes dendrolaphis and chrysopelea leap from high limbs,\r\nstretched out lengthwise and both flatten and broaden the body so that\r\nit presents a concave surface. They glide to earth slowly, at an angle\r\nto the vertical, and land apparently without injury.\r\n\r\nFrogs of some species have enormous webs between the fingers and toes\r\nwhich serve as parachutes. A Brazilian tree frog has been observed to\r\ndrop from an altitude of 100 feet and land 90 feet away uninjured.\r\nSince other frogs of the same size were killed when dropped vertically,\r\nparachuting must be considered a distinct trait of this particular\r\nspecies, developed over many generations of life in treetops.\r\n\r\nIn the course of experiments a South Carolina lizard, frequenter of\r\nbushes and fences, landed ten to twelve feet away from the place where\r\nit was dropped, at a height of 37 feet, and hopped away unhurt. It took\r\na rigid posture when dropped, limbs outstretched and stomach taut. It\r\nfell vertically a third of the distance to the ground and then started\r\nto glide. A lizard of another species from the same habit wriggled all\r\nthe way down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eagles Build Log Cabin Nests_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe white-headed eagle became the national bird of the United States\r\nby act of Congress on June 20, 1782. For nearly two centuries it has\r\nremained the American symbol of fearlessness and freedom. The same\r\nbird—Haleoletus leucocephalus and not the more familiar golden eagle\r\nfound in the West—had been the supreme totem animal of the Six Nations\r\nof the Iroquois from whom many institutions of the new republic\r\nindirectly may have been derived.\r\n\r\nThis eagle still is fairly abundant in the fringes of forest around the\r\nGreat Lakes, its fishing grounds. Its nest, almost always at the top of\r\na tall sycamore or hickory which is dead or dying, is almost literally\r\na log cabin. The bird sometimes uses sticks six feet long for the outer\r\nwalls. It grasps large dead branches in its talons, breaks them off by\r\nsheer force, and flies away with them. A recently observed nest was\r\nnine feet high and six feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Predatory Mantid_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy does the “praying mantid” pray? The prayerlike pose of this near\r\nrelative of the cockroach is its normal position both for seizing its\r\nvictims and for defending itself.\r\n\r\nFor their size mantids are among the most predatory animals in\r\nexistence. They are also among the least known of the insects. There\r\nare more than 1500 species in the world, mostly tropical. Only 19 are\r\nknown in the United States which is on the northern fringe of their\r\nnormal habitat. One of the most remarkable features of the mantid is\r\nits front legs, which bear sharp spines and fold in a curious hinged\r\nfashion enabling the insect to reach forward, seize a fly or some other\r\nvictim, and bring it to its mouth. This is the explanation for the\r\nseeming attitude of prayer.\r\n\r\nMantids feed entirely on other animals, chiefly insects caught alive.\r\nInstances of small birds, lizards and mice being eaten have been\r\nreported, probably due to mistaken observations. There is no question\r\nthat mature individuals of several species can handle any caterpillar,\r\ngrasshopper, cockroach or other large insect that comes within its\r\nrange. Their appetite is enormous. An adult mantid has been known to\r\neat ten cockroaches in less than three hours. Bees and wasps usually\r\nhave no terrors for the predators, although occasionally a mantid is\r\nstung while trying to catch a wasp and gives evidence of the injury.\r\n\r\nSometimes the mantid’s front legs are held in a posture of sparring,\r\nrather than of prayer. More than once the sight of one of these insects\r\n“sparring” with an English sparrow or some other small animal has\r\nattracted a crowd on a city street and gotten paragraphs in the local\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nThe mantid usually waits motionless until its prey comes within reach\r\nbut sometimes, supposedly when very hungry, it may stalk another\r\ninsect. Sometimes the victim is touched lightly with the antennae\r\nbefore the front legs flash forward and make the capture.\r\n\r\nThese insects have developed considerable camouflage. Some tropical\r\nspecies look like flowers, their colors blending with those of foliage.\r\nOne species varies in color from white to pale pink and has the\r\npractise of crouching among certain blossoms, the petals of which its\r\nlegs and other body parts resemble. Others have arranged themselves on\r\nplants so that they look like blue flowers. Presumably bees and other\r\nflower-loving insects thus are lured to their doom. A few tropical\r\nmantids have developed a superficial resemblance to other insects of\r\nthe same environment which are distasteful to birds and monkeys. Some\r\nclosely resemble large ants.\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread belief that the male always is eaten by the\r\nfemale after mating. Sometimes this happens, but the male never is\r\na willing victim and quite frequently escapes. The eggs are laid in\r\ngroups of from a dozen to about 400. They are deposited in layers in\r\nthe midst of a thick frothy liquid which soon hardens and becomes\r\nfibrous. For the most part, each species deposits egg masses of a\r\ndistinctive shape.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, they probably are beneficial insects because the\r\ngreater part of their prey consists of species injurious to gardens.\r\nThe possibility of propagating them for the control of injurious\r\ninsects, such as Japanese beetles, has been suggested because of their\r\nnotoriously big appetites. It would, however, be impossible to restrict\r\nthem to a specific pest. They would continue to eat about every living\r\ncreature of the right size that came within reach of their claws,\r\nincluding many beneficial species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fireflies as Electricians_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flashing of a field of fireflies is an expensive show. For\r\ntwo generations one of the ideals of science has been to produce\r\nartificially “cold light”—radiation confined entirely to those\r\nwavelengths to which the retina of the human eye is sensitive without\r\nany energy being wasted in the form of heat or invisible light. Could\r\nthe ideal be attained with the same expenditure of fuel and power as\r\nis required for light production at present the world’s bills for\r\nillumination would be decreased enormously.\r\n\r\nActually the firefly has attained this ideal in one direction. It emits\r\nonly visible light. From this point of view the firefly or any other\r\nsort of luminescent animal is very efficient indeed. A good part of the\r\ntotal radiation from any man-made source of light—or for that matter\r\nfrom the sun—is invisible infrared, observable only as heat. Possibly\r\nthe firefly produces some heat in its light production but it is too\r\nlittle to be measured. It is safe to say that within a tiny fraction,\r\n100% of the radiation produced is in the visible spectrum—most of it\r\nshorter wave lengths than those which produce the sensation of blue\r\nlight. This is by far the highest efficiency known to science.\r\n\r\nChemists can duplicate the process to a certain extent. Consequently\r\na great deal of research has been devoted to the light-emitting\r\nmechanism, physical and chemical, of the insects. Firefly luminescence\r\nis due to the oxidation—that is, the burning—of a chemical substance,\r\nluciferin. This reaction, in turn, depends upon a catalyst known as\r\nluciferase. The same phenomenon can be brought out by appropriate\r\nmixtures of luciferin, luciferase, and oxygen in a test-tube at the\r\nproper temperature.\r\n\r\nAll these experiments have shown that, considering the amount of oxygen\r\nnecessary, it is a very wasteful process. It is far less efficient\r\nthan most means of producing artificial light known to man—one percent\r\ncompared with the 4.54 percent of the carbon filament; 17.17 percent\r\nof the acetylene flame, or 60 percent of the sodium arc light. To\r\nilluminate houses or streets with firefly light would be a very\r\nexpensive procedure indeed.\r\n\r\nDr. N. D. Maluf of Yale University quotes a calculation that “an area\r\nof firefly light six feet in diameter on the ceiling of a room nine\r\nfeet high would give ample illumination for reading or drawing on a\r\ntable three feet high.” This would hardly interest an illuminating\r\nengineer. The light can, however, be used in an emergency. During the\r\nSpanish-American War Major General W. C. Gorgas is reputed to have used\r\nthe light from a bottle of fireflies to perform an emergency operation.\r\nThe average householder would rebel at the monthly bills.\r\n\r\nThe actual light from a single firefly is very minute indeed, averaging\r\nlittle more than 25 thousandths of a candle power. The combined\r\ncourtship efforts of a whole field full of the insects would hardly\r\nlight a single room enough for sewing or reading. The insect will\r\nsometimes glow steadily with a light as low as two hundred-thousandths\r\nof candle power intensity.\r\n\r\nAmong fireflies, flashing is essentially a courtship phenomenon, yet\r\nthere is no discernible difference between the quality of the light of\r\nmale and female insects. What actually happens is that the flash of the\r\nfemale in response to the signal of the male is timed almost exactly at\r\na trifle over two seconds. The male is instinctively aware of this time\r\ninterval, so that he does not become confused with the signals of other\r\nmales. In a large group of the insects the flashes of the two sexes\r\ntend to become synchronized, producing a field of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mollusk Vampire of Hell_\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack demon of the realm of everlasting dark is Vampyrotouthis\r\ninfernalis. Most nightmarish of living animals, this “vampire of hell”\r\nhas a midnight-black body about two inches long, red-brown round face\r\non a head almost as large as the rest of the body, red eyes an inch in\r\ndiameter encircled by narrow bands of pinkish-orange, rows of ivory\r\nwhite teeth, ten wriggling, ever-probing tentacles extending from the\r\nhead. On the sides of the neck are two powerful, flashing lights each\r\nof which is a cluster of about 50 tiny phosphorescent nodules. The\r\nentire body is covered with hundreds of tiny lights.\r\n\r\nFortunately nobody is likely to meet this horror of an\r\nhallucination-damned maniac’s ravings on a lonely road passing a\r\ngraveyard at night. It is a mollusk, a close relative of the octopus\r\nand the squid but belonging to neither family, which lives in abysses\r\nof sub-tropical seas all around the world, far below the depths reached\r\nby the most penetrating green rays of the sun. Only its relatively\r\nsmall size and restricted habitat prevent it from being the most\r\nfearsome, loathsome creature on this planet.\r\n\r\nThe “vampire” is a living fossil, survivor out of the demonic seas of\r\n200,000,000 years ago which found shelter from the inexorable scythe\r\nwith which time mows down demons by retreating further and further into\r\nthe dark. Imprints of quite similar sea animals, probably denizens of\r\nwarm, shallow waters, have been found in English rocks.\r\n\r\nUp to now about a hundred individuals have been taken from the deep\r\nsea, mostly by scientific expeditions. Of these, nearly two-thirds\r\nhave come from the Atlantic off the Florida coast and near Bermuda.\r\nThere are several in the Smithsonian collections. The fantastically\r\nterrible little mollusk was first taken in the Indian Ocean by Dr. Carl\r\nCuhn of the German Valdavia expedition about 75 years ago. Until quite\r\nrecently all specimens obtained have been in poor condition and there\r\nhas been considerable difficulty in classifying them. The job has been\r\ncomplicated by the fact that the vampire apparently undergoes a series\r\nof metamorphoses which have been mistaken for different species. During\r\nthe past ten years, however, they have been studied intensively by Dr.\r\nGrace Pickford of the Bingham Oceanographic Laboratory of Yale and\r\ntheir fearsome reality has been established beyond question.\r\n\r\nNaturally, since the living animal cannot be observed, essentially\r\nlittle is known of its habits and ways of life. Certainly it is a\r\nvoracious carnivore like all others of its race and preys upon every\r\nother creature of the depths in its size range. It seems to be confined\r\nexclusively to a depth of about 1,500 meters. This is the level of the\r\nsea where, for some reason oceanographers are unable to fathom, the\r\noxygen content of the water is lowest. It goes up immediately both\r\nabove and below. The vampire, apparently, cannot stand too much oxygen.\r\nIts eggs sink to about 2,000 meters where they reach their suspension\r\nlevel. As soon as the little mollusks hatch they rise to their natural\r\nhabitat.\r\n\r\nThe vampire has powerful tentacles but its fin muscles indicate that\r\nit is a weak swimmer. It probably lurks in the abysmal darkness for\r\nits prey to come within reach of the probing tentacles. Even with its\r\nenormous eyes and its many lights it hardly can distinguish moving\r\nobjects very well and presumably is not particular about what living\r\nthings it eats. Its usual victims probably are fishes and smaller\r\nmollusks. It is unlikely that the creature has many natural enemies it\r\nneed fear. Unlike the octopuses, its nearest relations, it has no ink\r\nsac from which to discharge a black cloud around its body for its own\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climbing and Flying Frogs_\r\n\r\n\r\nA family of frogs that climb trees, burrow and are learning to fly are\r\nthe tree frogs of Mexican tropical forests. Various members of the\r\nfamily are at different stages in their physical adaptation to tree\r\nlife. They constitute a striking example of evolution at work as a race\r\nstruggles to shake itself free from one environment and conquer another\r\ndespite considerable odds.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the fingers and toes of those frogs are provided with\r\nadhesive disks by means of which the animals are able to obtain a firm\r\nfoothold on relatively smooth surfaces. These disks are used mainly\r\nfor climbing, or for clinging to foliage and limbs when jumping. One\r\nspecies is both a climber and burrower. It is an extremely timid little\r\ncreature and a poor climber, but it buries itself deeply in tree\r\nmosses. Another species, which seems as much as home on the ground\r\nas in the trees, deposits its eggs on the upper surfaces of leaves\r\noverhanging the water. The tadpoles, which must return to the water\r\nfor their metamorphosis into frogs, simply drop off the leaves after\r\nthey leave the eggs. Perhaps the most peculiar of the family is the\r\nmarsupial frog, Gastrotheca, all of whose young are sheltered in a\r\npouch on the back of the female. Some of the family lay their eggs in\r\nnests of froth attached to leaves.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable species seems to be developing the ability to fly. Its\r\nhind limbs are elongated for jumping and it has been known to leap\r\nand alight without injury from a height of 140 feet. When handled it\r\nexudes a poisonous, milky fluid which coagulates instantly, sticking to\r\nthe fingers in a disagreeable way. It has a strong odor, like that of\r\npeaches, which causes the inside of the nose to itch. Experiments are\r\ndescribed in which this animal was dropped from the top of a high water\r\ntower. It immediately spread out its limbs and, instead of dropping\r\nvertically, sailed slowly downward and landed uninjured on the ground\r\nabout 90 feet away. Apparently it was able to get the best of gravity\r\nafter a drop of about twelve feet. From that point on, there was no\r\napparent acceleration in the speed of descent. A state of equilibrium\r\nwas reached. Whenever one of these frogs was thrown in the air it\r\ninvariably managed, after a violent struggle, to establish itself in a\r\nbalanced position which it could maintain, apparently without effort,\r\nwhile it glided to the ground.\r\n\r\nWithin certain limits these tree frogs can change their color so\r\nthat their bodies will blend more perfectly with their surroundings.\r\nOne of the most widely distributed Mexican species seems to have an\r\nexceptional color range. This particular creature also is notable\r\nfor its elusiveness. It exists in countless numbers, yet an explorer\r\nmay hunt for weeks without encountering a single one. Such was the\r\nexperience of the German naturalist, Hans Gadow. While wandering along\r\nthe edge of the forest he heard what seemed to be the noise of a\r\nsawmill in the distance. As he came nearer this sound changed into a\r\nroar like that of steam escaping from many boilers, mingled with the\r\nsharp and piercing scream of saws. It came from a meadow containing a\r\nshallow rainwater pool in which were tens of thousands of large, green\r\ntree frogs. Gadow calculated that in this pool, about thirty yards\r\nsquare, and in the immediate neighborhood, were more than 45,000 of the\r\ncreatures. The water of the pool was covered with their spawn—a minimum\r\nof 100,000,000 eggs. The next morning there was not a single frog in\r\nsight. The water had evaporated during the night and the eggs were left\r\nto be cooked by the sun.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious of these creatures is the banana frog, whose\r\nhabitat often is the upper side of a banana leaf. It is an extremely\r\nelusive creature whose color undergoes considerable change without\r\nbeing specifically responsive, so far has been observed, to the\r\nintensity of light. Another curious member of the family wraps its eggs\r\nin foamy lather and suspends the whole mass between leaves or blades of\r\ngrass over water in such a manner that the next heavy rain washes the\r\ndeveloping eggs or tadpoles into it. It is necessary that the tadpole\r\nstage be passed in water. Development of means to bring this about was\r\nnecessary before the family could conquer a tree environment.\r\n\r\nAnother little frog spends its entire life in the leaf-formed cup of\r\na bromelia, a plant somewhat similar in appearance to a small century\r\nplant, which grows on the branches of trees where its roots get a\r\nprecarious foothold. During the rainy season this cup becomes filled\r\nwith water. There the frog lays its eggs, which hatch as pollywogs.\r\n\r\nTruly demonic are fantastic horned frogs of Brazil which devour other\r\namphibians and small mammals. The largest of them do not hesitate to\r\ndefy a human being in the mountain rain forests, their chief habitat.\r\nThey are six inches long or longer and as broad as long. Some have\r\nhorns on their eyelids and the tips of their noses. All have enormous\r\nmouths, so that a mouse can be swallowed quite easily. When excited\r\nthey inflate their bodies like balloons and utter bull-like bellows. At\r\nother times they are heard to cry like infants.\r\n\r\nThe horns probably serve no other purpose than to add to the ferocious\r\nappearance of the animals. They are just hardened extensions of the\r\nskin, entirely too soft to be of any value in combat. All species of\r\nhorned frogs are rare in collections. They seldom are seen because of\r\ntheir secluded habitat and their clever camouflage. They throw loose\r\ndirt over their damp bodies until they become practically invisible.\r\n\r\nRarest of the family are the pigmy horned frogs which have horns on\r\nboth eyelids and the tip of the nose, as well as a fringe of horns\r\naround the eyes. They are beautifully marked animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mad Dog Cycles_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may be mad dog cycles. Dogs are much more vicious in June than in\r\nthe so-called “dog-days” season of July and August.\r\n\r\nThe tiny poodle and the pekingese share with the big German police\r\ndog and the Italian bull rank among the 10 most vicious of domestic\r\ncanines. These are some of the conclusions reached by Dr. Robert Oleson\r\nof the U. S. Public Health Service on the basis of data about dogs in\r\nthe metropolitan New York area for 27 years.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, Dr. Oleson’s study shows there were two 5-year\r\npeaks in rabies, from 1911 to 1915, inclusive, and from 1926 to 1930.\r\nDuring the first period the annual average of bites diagnosed as made\r\nby rabies-infected animals was 233, compared with only an average of\r\n78 for the previous three years for which records were available.\r\nThere followed a period of 10 years during which the number of rabies\r\ncases diagnosed in biting dogs averaged only 43 a year. Starting with\r\n1926 the curve leaped up again and in the next five years there was an\r\naverage of 288 cases a year. Then came another rapid decline.\r\n\r\nApparently the number of rabies cases has no relation to the number of\r\nbites. These remained practically stationary at an average of about\r\n3,500 from 1908 to 1926. There was a sudden jump to more than 7,000\r\ncases in 1925, just before the start of the second rabies peak. But\r\nsince 1930 the number of bites reported has continued to go up, in the\r\nface of rigid muzzling restrictions, until it has reached the alarming\r\nfigure of 20,000. At the same time the number of rabies cases rapidly\r\nhas gone down.\r\n\r\nThe same tendency toward the mad dog cycle has been noted in several\r\nEuropean countries. It may be due to an inexplicable waxing and\r\nwaning of the virulency of the rabies virus. During the peak years\r\nextraordinary efforts were made to impound all unlicensed dogs, and the\r\ndecline of the waves may have been due to the lessening of the number\r\nof potential rabies carriers by this means.\r\n\r\nContrary to general belief, dogs are getting better tempered rapidly\r\nduring dog days. The high peak of the year in bites is reached about\r\nthe middle of June. Then comes a very sharp drop, which continues\r\nsteadily as colder weather comes on.\r\n\r\nNo breed of dogs is entirely free from the biting tendency, but some\r\nare much more prone to it than others. The mongrel doesn’t rank among\r\nthe really vicious dogs and pedigree counts for nothing. The 10 breeds,\r\nin the order of frequency of their reported bites, are: German police,\r\nchow, poodle, Italian bull, fox terrier, crossed chow, airedale,\r\npekingese and crossed German police dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Amazing Survival of the Opossum_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opossum, sole survivor in the New World of a primitive and\r\nvery ancient family, represents an overlooked principle in\r\nevolution—survival by endurance.\r\n\r\nHow this clumsy, persecuted animal has endured through millions of\r\ngenerations in the midst of savage and hungry foes is the subject of a\r\nrevealing study by Dr. J. D. Black of the University of Kansas.\r\n\r\nDr. Black examined closely the skeletons of 95 opossums in the\r\nuniversity museum—all killed in the immediate vicinity. Thirty-nine\r\nof them gave evidence of broken bones that had completely healed. One\r\nspecimen had suffered, and recovered from, breaks of both scapulae,\r\n11 ribs, two broken in three places, and a badly injured spine. Still\r\nanother gave evidence of having suffered at the same time fractures of\r\nthe jaw, the scapulae, and nine ribs. Many showed evidence of ribs and\r\nscapulae broken in several places. The ability to survive such severe\r\ninjuries—they would be fatal in any other animal either in themselves\r\nor because the crippled condition resulting from them would make a\r\ncreature an easy prey to its enemies—illustrates the importance of the\r\nopossum’s practice of playing dead.\r\n\r\nThe opossum represents an important stage in the evolution of\r\nmammals—that of the marsupials, or pouch bearers. They presumably\r\nwere quite widely distributed over the earth at one time, before the\r\nemergence of the placental type of mammals to which the human race\r\nbelongs, together with almost all other warm-blooded animals. They may\r\nbe the ancestors of the placentals or they may represent a different\r\nline of development from the ancestral reptiles. In any event, they are\r\nconsiderably nearer the type of those ancient egg-laying reptiles. They\r\nare just a step beyond the egg-laying stage.\r\n\r\nWhen the placentals arose the marsupials quickly disappeared from most\r\nof the earth. They were not so well adapted for survival in conflict\r\nwith the more advanced, efficient type of animal. Only in Australia\r\ndid they find a haven. With a single exception, they were the only\r\nmammals there when the continent first was discovered by white men.\r\nThis has led to the speculation that Australia was cut off from the\r\nrest of the world before the placental races were evolved, or before\r\nthey had attained such efficiency in the ways of life as to enable them\r\nto survive. There the marsupials, without competition, were able to\r\nsurvive and differentiate into rich fauna of the continent—of which the\r\nkangaroos are considered the most characteristic animals.\r\n\r\nThe one exception was in North and South America in the person of the\r\nlowly opossum. All the meat-eating animals which arose around the\r\ncreature fed upon it if they could catch it. It was not very efficient\r\nin getting away from a pursuer. It developed no effective armor, like\r\nthe shell of the armadillo or the quills of the porcupine, with which\r\nother weak animals managed to survive. It was not even very efficient\r\nat hiding. When man arrived on the scene with his bows and his guns,\r\nits last havens, the treetops, lost their small measure of security.\r\n\r\nAll the cards were stacked against the survival of the opossum, but it\r\ndeveloped a means of its own to keep a tenacious hold on life while\r\nfar more efficient creatures—beset with new enemies and changing\r\nclimates—were forced to give up. The great mammoth herds, lords of\r\nthe earth for a million years, disappeared. The ferocious saber-tooth\r\ntiger and the great cave bear expired by the roadside in the race of\r\nevolution. But the poor opossum had discovered the important principle\r\nthat the meek shall inherit the earth—or, at least, be allowed to live\r\nin it. It became the great pain endurer and lived by submitting and\r\ngritting its teeth. It didn’t fight nor hide. It merely suffered and\r\nlearned how to endure suffering. This supreme ability of the opossum to\r\nrecover from injuries goes a long way toward explaining its survival.\r\n\r\nThe opossum thus appears to be the prototype of a familiar class of\r\nmen and women. They are frequently encountered. As children they have\r\nalmost every conceivable disease. Their adolescence is a continuous\r\nsuccession of broken bones. Their parents despair of raising them.\r\nWhen they come to adult life the story is much the same. They suffer a\r\nconstant stream of misfortunes, physical and otherwise. Physicians are\r\namazed at their recoveries. And they often survive into the 80s and 90s\r\nof life while the healthy, fortunate individuals with whom they started\r\nout are left behind in the prime of life—victims of pneumonia, heart\r\ndisease or accident. When the latter die the news comes as a surprise\r\nto their acquaintances who cannot understand how the strong die and the\r\nweak survive. They ponder over the paradox that strength is weakness\r\nand weakness strength. The ancient opossum might explain that paradox\r\nif it had the means to express itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mammal Prototypes of the “Mermaid”_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prototypes of the “mermaids” of legend are among the least known\r\nof all animals to naturalists because of their underwater habitat and\r\ntheir secretive habits. They are the manatees of the Caribbean region\r\nand the dugongs of the Indian Ocean. They constitute the only remaining\r\nspecies of the serenia, or moon creatures, distant relatives of the\r\nelephant. Both have a somewhat human facial appearance. They feed\r\nstanding upright in the water, their flippers held out before them like\r\narms. Sometimes the females hold their calves in these flippers. Seen\r\nfrom a distance, they have a curiously human appearance, which may\r\naccount for the many reports of mermaids and mermen.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true of the dugong—a creature of the open sea,\r\nwith a white, almost hairless body. It is extremely secretive and has\r\nalmost never been captured alive. When one is washed ashore or caught\r\nin a fisher’s net it causes superstitious fear among the natives. The\r\nmanatees are not so human in appearance and are much better known.\r\n\r\nThe creatures seldom make their appearance above water in daylight.\r\nThey prefer to gaze in the moonlight, and this has added to their\r\nhumanlike appearance which has given rise to the mermaid legends.\r\n\r\nOne of the few persons to study the animal at close range, O. W.\r\nBarrett, an American explorer, tells us the following concerning the\r\nmanatee:\r\n\r\n“The animal still is fairly common in most fresh-water bayous, lagoons\r\nand rivers along the east coast of Nicaragua. One of the best-known\r\nherds on the Caribbean Coast inhabits the Indio River, just north of\r\nGreytown, Nicaragua. Estimates of its number vary from a few score to\r\nseveral hundred. The herd apparently is stationary there and does not\r\nincrease or decrease to any notable degree from year to year, although\r\nthe natives take a heavy toll....\r\n\r\n“A manatee can remain under water from 20 to 30 minutes when\r\nfrightened. During the daytime the slightest unusual noise, like rain\r\nfalling on a tin pail or the spitting of the hunter, is sufficient to\r\nkeep the whole herd submerged for hours, yet while they are grazing the\r\nhunter may go up and slap them on the back unnoticed.\r\n\r\n“Families consisting of a bull, a cow, and one or two calves usually\r\n... merge into a herd of from 10 to 50 or more individuals living in a\r\ncertain stretch of river, concentrating during the day and scattering\r\nat night. They generally graze at night, although a few individuals may\r\nbe seen feeding in broad daylight. The body is held nearly vertical\r\nwhile grazing. The head is held well out of water, while the armlike\r\nflippers poke the grass toward the mouth. The noise made by the\r\nflapping of the huge upper lip and the crunching of the large teeth\r\ncan be heard distinctly 200 yards or more away. The sound is much\r\nlike that of horses grazing in a pasture. Adult manatees appear to\r\naverage somewhere between 8 and 10 feet in length. Some—old females,\r\npresumably—may reach 12 feet.”\r\n\r\nA much more seclusive animal is the true “mermaid” of legend—the\r\ndugong of the open ocean. Unlike the manatee, it is a creature of\r\nthe sea and seldom ventures into the fresh-water rivers and lagoons.\r\nFew naturalists ever have actually seen one of the creatures. Mr.\r\nBarrett’s first acquaintance with the creature came in Mozambique,\r\nPortuguese East Africa, when some native fishermen caught in their net\r\nwhat they described as a “white porpoise.” They were terrified and\r\ngladly presented their catch to an Italian blacksmith. This man crudely\r\nembalmed the animal, placed it in a rough coffin and freighted it to\r\nJohannesburg, where he rented a show room and made a fortune exhibiting\r\n“the only genuine mermaid—half fish, half human.”\r\n\r\nFor many years mariners in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea have told\r\nof seeing objects resembling women standing waist high on the surface.\r\nZoologists of the Middle Ages described a “bishop fish” which had been\r\nseen standing with outstretched arms, supposedly blessing the waters.\r\nIn nearly every case, it seems likely, the objects were strange water\r\nanimals—the dugongs. They have a curious resemblance to human beings,\r\nespecially naked women, when seen from a distance.\r\n\r\nNearly all mermaid stories have originated in water where dugongs\r\nare abundant. Spanish and Portuguese sailors, the first Europeans to\r\nencounter the animal, called it the “woman fish.” The creature is best\r\nknown to Malagasy fishermen of Madagascar who, while they prize its\r\nflesh highly, attribute to it human qualities and affinities. After\r\ncapturing one the fisherman must perform various religious rites and\r\nbefore he is allowed to sell the flesh at a public market he must take\r\nan oath that there have been no unnatural relations between himself and\r\nhis mermaid victim.\r\n\r\nThe female’s breasts are roughly in about the position of those of\r\nwomen. She has the habit of rising about halfway out of the water and\r\nsometimes has been described as holding her baby in her flippers.\r\nLittle is known of the life history and habits of the dugong. It is a\r\ncreature of the shallow sea which never has survived long in captivity.\r\nIt seems to share with the elephant and with man the faculty of\r\nshedding tears when it is in trouble or pain. One which was kept for\r\nseveral months in the Colombo zoo in Ceylon constantly was weeping.\r\nMalagasy fishermen used to torture the animals in order to collect the\r\ntears, which they sold as love charms.\r\n\r\nAnother extant member of the “mermaid” family is the manatee, found\r\non both sides of the Atlantic in the warm, fresh water rivers of\r\nAfrica and South America. Although never mistaken for a human, it is\r\naccorded considerable superstitious regard. The Kalaboi of Nigeria\r\nregard it as a sacred animal and the incarnation of a human soul. If\r\na fisherman kills one, by accident or otherwise, he must undergo an\r\nelaborate cleansing ceremony which involves offerings before images of\r\nhis ancestors and remaining indoors for three days. During this period\r\nhe is rubbed from head to foot with a yellow pigment by women of his\r\nfamily. While the purgative rites are in progress the women sing at\r\ndawn and dusk. On the third day there is a feast on the meat, but a bit\r\nmust be given to every household in the village to lay upon the shrines\r\nof ancestors.\r\n\r\nBoth manatee and dugong, and formerly the extinct sea cow of Bering\r\nSea, are probably the closest living relatives of the elephant. They\r\nhave similar brain and heart structure. The molar teeth of the mermaid\r\nfamily are like those of early elephants. The male dugong has tusks.\r\nThere also is a great extension of the upper lip which overlaps the\r\nside of the mouth—a start in the direction of a trunk.\r\n\r\nThe next nearest relatives of the elephants are the hyraces, or conies,\r\nof Africa and Syria, best known in the form of expensive fur coats.\r\nThey look and act like rabbits. A Hebrew prophet made them symbolic of\r\ntimidity. Only a taxonomist would suspect these little creatures could\r\nclaim any kinship to the largest of land mammals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limbless Lizards and Glass Snakes_\r\n\r\n\r\nA supposedly welcome guest in the underground chambers of leaf cutter\r\nants is the amphisbaena, a nearly limbless lizard about a foot long\r\nwhich looks somewhat like a gigantic earth worm. These creatures,\r\nseldom seen, can be found from Brazil north to lower California and\r\nthere is one isolated species in Florida.\r\n\r\n“Those brought to me,” observed the noted British naturalist and\r\nexplorer of Brazil, Henry Walter Bates, “were generally not much more\r\nthan a foot in length. They are of cylindrical shape having, properly\r\nspeaking, no neck, and the blunt tail which is only about an inch in\r\nlength is of the same shape as the head. This peculiar form, added to\r\ntheir habit of wriggling backwards as well as forwards, has given rise\r\nto the fable that they have two heads, one at each extremity. They are\r\nextremely sluggish in their motions, and are clothed with scales that\r\nhave the form of small imbedded plates arranged in rings around the\r\nbody. The eye is so small as to be scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\n“They live habitually in the subterranean chamber of the Sauba ant;\r\nonly coming out of their abodes occasionally in the night-time. The\r\nnatives call the amphisbaena the “mai das Saubas,” or mother of Saubas,\r\nand believe it to be poisonous, although it is perfectly harmless.\r\nThey say the ants treat it with great affection and that if the\r\n“snake” be taken away from the nest the ants also will forsake it.\r\nI believe, however, that they feed on the saubas, for I once found\r\nremains of the ants in the stomach of one of them.\r\n\r\n“Their motions are quite peculiar. The undilatable jaws, small eyes and\r\ncurious plated integument distinguish them from other snakes. These\r\nproperties evidently have some relation to their residence in the\r\nsubterranean abodes.”\r\n\r\nClosely related is the Florida worm lizard, rose-colored and completely\r\nlegless and earless. It is about a foot long and looks so much like an\r\nearthworm that expert collectors have been fooled. A peculiarity is\r\nthat it always goes down into a burrow tail first.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona worm lizard, a somewhat fabulous animal of the same family,\r\nis not, so far as is known, represented in any collection. One veteran\r\nminer told of dragging “a purple snake with two legs on its neck” from\r\nthe gravel. A woman claimed to have kept as a pet for three months “a\r\npurple snake with its legs where its ears ought to be.”\r\n\r\nAll these animals are in the same general family as the glass snakes\r\nof Europe and the United States. These are long, slender, legless\r\nlizards. They are burrowing animals which occasionally are turned up\r\nby ploughmen, but they often come to the surface voluntarily at night.\r\nSpecimens occasionally found in daylight usually are hiding in dark\r\nrecesses.\r\n\r\nEach animal consists of apparently quite separate parts, body and tail.\r\nThe body is from six inches to a foot long, according to species,\r\nand the tail may be twice as long. The animal can disengage its tail\r\nby a single twist when caught by that organ. The slightest injury or\r\nrough handling causes this tail to fly to pieces. Each piece wriggles\r\nenergetically, supposedly to attract attention while the lizard itself\r\ncrawls to safety in its burrow. The body does not break up and does\r\nnot, as popularly reputed, come back later to gather up fragments\r\nof its tail. Instead it grows a new tail, always smaller than the\r\noriginal, from the stump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Only Bug in the Sea_\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly one group of insects has taken to the sea—the small, gray\r\nlong-legged water striders. Unlike fresh water relatives of the same\r\ngenus, these have permanently lost their wings. They have no further\r\nuse for this means of movement in the ocean.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers have been found floating and swimming in the open sea\r\naround Pacific islands. Both nymphs and adults sometimes are blown onto\r\nthe beaches by strong winds. They are awkward on land, seek shelter\r\nin any depression in the sand, and fall easy prey to birds and the\r\nmultitude of ghost crabs which glide over the sands after dark.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of shallow water the insects are found in groups of\r\nhundreds of thousands. Apparently they feed on plankton which rises\r\nto the surface at night. They themselves are not eaten by fish. This\r\nis probably due to scent glands which secrete a strong odor which is\r\nrepellant to the ever hungry vertebrates.\r\n\r\nIn small embayments are found enormous numbers of one type of water\r\nstrider, the female of which is less than a twelfth of an inch long.\r\nThe male is considerably smaller and rides on the back of his mate to\r\nensure that the two will not be separated by wind or tide.\r\n\r\nInsects are by far the most abundant of all land animals; the reasons\r\nwhy only one genus has invaded the sea have been the subject of much\r\nspeculation. On the continents, insects are found in salt water lakes\r\nwhere the saline concentration is much greater than in sea water.\r\nOther types live in torrential streams and waterfalls where they get\r\nmuch rougher treatment than would come from wave action. There are two\r\nprobable reasons for the failure to invade the ocean. One is the fact\r\nthat no insect ever has been able to live in very deep water. The “bug”\r\nrace has evolved a special breathing mechanism admirably suited to life\r\non land but rather poorly adapted to life under water. Besides, the\r\nseas have been taken over almost completely by the remote relatives of\r\nthe insects, the crustaceans. These include, besides crabs and shrimps,\r\nthe superabundant copepods, the “lice of the ocean.” Invaders from the\r\nland never have been able to compete with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Crocodile With Life After Death_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an animal that can bite—it might even slash off a man’s\r\narm—after it is dead. Alive it is relatively inoffensive. Being killed\r\nmakes it positively mad.\r\n\r\nIts uncanny ability to bite half an hour or more after its neck\r\nhas been broken is a major risk for followers of one of the most\r\nadventurous of professions—the jungle crocodile hunters. Their story is\r\na saga paralleling that of the Antarctic whalers who first told of Moby\r\nDick. One of the most expert of them is Dr. Fred Medem, Smithsonian\r\ncollaborator and professor of zoology at the University of Bogota. He\r\nhas twice been bitten painfully by “dead” reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe animal is the caiman, smaller than either alligator or crocodile\r\nand probably more closely related to the former. Its hide, like that of\r\nits two fellow crocodillians, is valuable for leather and during the\r\npast few years it has been pursued close to extinction by professional\r\nhunters in Colombian and Brazilian jungles and lagoons. Dr. Medem is\r\nan eminent zoologist. He doesn’t believe, of course, that any animal\r\nthat is completely dead can bite off a man’s arm, but he is hard put\r\nto explain what he himself has experienced. He thinks that part of the\r\ncaiman’s nervous system which activates its snout and mouth is somehow\r\ndisconnected from the rest and does not die at the same time. Thus\r\nthe dead reptile has no consciousness when it bites. It is a reflex\r\naction of one small segment of the nervous system that somehow is not\r\ncompletely dead.\r\n\r\nThere is only one way to be safe for an indefinite period after the\r\ncaiman is killed. That is to chop a hole in its neck and run a pointed\r\nstick into the medulla oblongata, the reflex action center at the base\r\nof the brain. When this is destroyed the ability to bite is lost. One\r\ncan proceed to skin the animal without fear of losing an arm or a\r\nfinger. Ordinarily this reptile will not attack a human. It lives on\r\nsmaller animals—wild and domestic pigs and the pig-like capybaras—that\r\nventure into the jungle rivers.\r\n\r\nDr. Medem has recently discovered a curious new sub-species of caimans\r\nconfined, so far as known, to the upper reaches of the Apaporis river,\r\na tributary of the Amazon. It is much more crocodile-like in appearance\r\nthan the rest of the family, with a very long, narrow snout. The others\r\nhave broad, flat snouts. It retains prominent bony ridges over its\r\neyes—one of the most striking characteristics that distinguish the\r\ncaimans from both crocodiles and alligators.\r\n\r\nA much more dangerous animal is the Orinoco crocodile, a large reptile\r\nwhich lives only in the Orinoco and its tributaries and has a taste\r\nfor human flesh. The creature is especially dangerous to bathers and\r\nto women doing their washing in the rivers. This is one of the two\r\nspecies of these dreaded reptiles known in South America. The other is\r\na smaller, less aggressive creature of seashore rivers and lagoons.\r\nThe inland species now is quite close to extermination. Until recently\r\nit was pursued by both German and French companies of professional\r\ncrocodile hunters. Now they have given up because the profits have\r\nbecome too small for the risk.\r\n\r\nThe technique for hunting caimans and crocodiles is strikingly like\r\nthat of the whale hunters and just as dangerous. The hunter goes out\r\non the river with a boat at night. The boat carries searchlights which\r\nmove over the surface of the water. Here and there appear glittering\r\nred and yellow spots. The red spots are the eyes of crocodiles,\r\nthe yellow ones eyes of caimans. The boat is propelled by jungle\r\nIndians who have developed the ability to paddle noiselessly. They\r\nrow to within about two yards of a pair of glittering eyes. Then the\r\nhunter throws his harpoon, equipped with a special aiming apparatus.\r\nHe has developed skill in hitting precisely the right spot, judged\r\nby the position of the eyes. For a crocodile he aims at where the\r\nneck should be, for a caiman at the flank. The neck of the latter\r\nreptile is protected by heavy scales. A gun never is used. The wounded\r\nreptile simply would dive into deep water where its body could not be\r\nrecovered. After the harpoon, with a rope attached, finds its mark\r\nthere is a terrific struggle as the reptile tries to get into deep\r\nwater. The caiman finally is “killed” by chopping through its spinal\r\ncord with a machete. That is, everything is dead except the brain and\r\nthe snout. The spine of a crocodile is broken by a blow with a large ax\r\njust behind the shoulders. It stays dead.\r\n\r\nThe caimans migrate overland from lagoon to lagoon during the dry\r\nseason. When at last they find water they dig holes in the mud and\r\nsleep until the heavy rains return, when they emerge and resume their\r\nnormal ways of life. Quite exciting stories are told of persons who\r\nhappen to meet migrating bands of these “barbillos”, creatures about\r\nthree feet long. Ordinarily they will not attack humans but they will\r\nnot hesitate to do so if they feel they are threatened. Once one of\r\nthem gets a grip it is almost impossible to break away unless one\r\nhappens to have a machete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Salamander That Lives Like a Worm_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an animal related to the salamander and the frog which looks\r\nlike a gigantic earthworm and lives an earthworm’s life. It is seen\r\nso rarely that probably not one person in a million is aware of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIt is the caecilian, a very ancient creature forming the third branch\r\nof the order of amphibians which were probably the first back-boned\r\nanimals to establish themselves on land nearly 300,000,000 years ago.\r\nThere are about fifty species. Caecilians are found in most of tropical\r\nAmerica, Africa and Asia. They range in length from a few inches to\r\nnearly a yard. The larger ones might be mistaken either for titanic\r\nearthworms or small snakes. In the physical structure are combined\r\nfeatures of both salamanders and frogs.\r\n\r\nThese amphibians spend all their lives burrowing in the soil. They\r\nlive chiefly on earthworms and come to the surface only for brief\r\nintervals after heavy rains. They usually are seen only by farmers who\r\nuncover them while ploughing, or digging ditches. Since they are so\r\neasily mistaken for snakes they are avoided, although they are entirely\r\nharmless. They have sharp teeth but make no effort to bite when handled.\r\n\r\nMost of the caecilians are egg-layers, the large eggs being attached to\r\none another like beads on a string and then wound up in a ball. This\r\nis incubated by the mother who coils herself around it. The burrows\r\nwhere the eggs are laid are always on a stream bank since the young,\r\nlike those of all amphibians, must pass part of their development\r\nstage in water. These amphibians probably are fairly abundant animals.\r\nOwing to the subterranean life they are nearly, perhaps in some cases\r\ncompletely, blind.\r\n\r\nThe amphiuma, a species of salamander, also is often mistaken for a\r\nsnake. It spends most of its life in rivers buried in mud, where it\r\nlives on larvae and on fish eggs. Since it is an air-breathing creature\r\nit must come to the surface frequently to breath.\r\n\r\nThe amphiuma has rudimentary legs, almost microscopic in size. This\r\nfact alone is enough to differentiate it from the snakes, who always\r\nare legless.\r\n\r\nThis curious salamander is seldom encountered and is barely mentioned\r\nin standard textbooks of natural history. Confined to the southeastern\r\nUnited States, it often is considered a highly poisonous animal.\r\nActually it is harmless. Very rarely one is caught on a fishhook. It is\r\nso slippery that it is almost impossible to hold in the hand.\r\n\r\nThe creature has some relatives which are not so secretive in their\r\nhabits and are much better known. One is the giant salamander of China\r\nand Japan, the largest and most active of the race. It makes its home\r\nin crevices under rocks in running streams. Another is the “mud puppy”\r\nor “hell bender” which sometimes gets on the hooks of fishermen in\r\nmuddy streams.\r\n\r\nThe amphiuma is a degenerate member of the family. It has almost lost\r\nits legs. It still retains its eyes, but these have become very small.\r\nThe animal can have very little use for them.\r\n\r\nIn India is found a wormlike caecilian, Ichthyopis, which lives under\r\nstones and burrows after the fashion of earthworms. Superficially it\r\ndiffers from an earthworm by its darker color. Its body is coated with\r\nslime and it leaves a trail of mucous behind it when it crawls.\r\n\r\nThe earth snake Silybura is found in the same region. It usually is\r\nmistaken for a worm, especially by birds to their own discomfort and\r\nsometimes disaster. It ties itself in loops around a bird’s feet and\r\nthese loops are quite difficult to loosen. Among natives there is a\r\nsuperstition that if it coils around a child’s finger the only way to\r\nget rid of it is to amputate the member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Three-eyed Lizards of New Zealand_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong sun-baked rocks on barren islands off the New Zealand coast basks\r\na solitary survivor of the days before the dinosaurs. It is earth’s\r\noldest back-boned inhabitant, a fugitive in time from nature’s harsh\r\nlaw of the survival of the fittest—the tuatera, or three-eyed lizard.\r\nIts big, dreamy hazel eyes have watched the procession of the ages for\r\n300,000,000 years—the beginning and extinction of the dinosaurs to whom\r\nit stood in about the relationship of a great uncle, the coming of\r\nbirds and mammals, milleniums of famine and milleniums of plenty, the\r\nshattering and crashing together of continents. It has survived while\r\nall its contemporaries of the earth’s ancient days have died, largely\r\nbecause it has been willing placidly to watch the parade pass without\r\nbothering to take any part in the tumult and shouting.\r\n\r\nThe feature of great interest about the tuatera, both popularly and\r\nscientifically, is its third eye. This third, or pineal, eye is closer\r\nto its original form in the tuatera than in any other living creature.\r\nJust after the little reptile is hatched the organ appears as a dark\r\nspot under a film of thin, semi-transparent skin. In a baby tuatera it\r\nbecomes a small knob on top of the head. Thick, opaque skin covers the\r\neye in the adult reptile and it is difficult to distinguish. Anatomists\r\ndoubt whether the animal actually sees with the pineal eye any more.\r\nThe fact remains that this organ can be distinguished easily and that\r\nit retains, in degenerated form, the characteristics of a seeing eye\r\nwhich has nerve connections with the visual cortex at the back of the\r\nbrain. Moreover, when the third eye of an infant tuatera is dissected\r\nthere is clear evidence that it once was a double organ.\r\n\r\nThe tuatera is about two feet long from its snout to the tip of a\r\ncrocodile-like tail. It has a scaly skin with a row of spines along its\r\nback. Its large hazel eyes are its most conspicuous feature. They have\r\na soft, dreamy expression, and they never appear to blink. There are no\r\nexternal ears, but the sense of hearing is highly developed. One way of\r\ndrawing the creature from its burrow is to play a tune on almost any\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nIt does not dig its own holes under the rocks. Usually it shares\r\nthe burrow of a black-and-white petrel—known in New Zealand as the\r\nmutton-bird—and it remains there even when the bird incubates its eggs\r\nand feeds its nestlings. Apparently a mutually satisfactory arrangement\r\nhas been reached between petrel and lizard. The former usually are\r\nin their nests only at night. The tuatera spends most of the night\r\naway from home, hunting for the insects which are its favorite food.\r\nOccasionally, it has been observed, a host will become tired of his\r\npersistent house guest and try to evict it. In such a case the tuatera\r\nnever puts up a fight. It leaves placidly and tries to find some other\r\npetrel with whom it can share quarters. If this search fails it will,\r\nas a last extremity, scoop out its own burrow, although apparently such\r\nlabor is against its deeply fixed principles of making no effort which\r\npossibly can be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe lizard goes to sleep about the middle of April, the beginning of\r\nwinter in New Zealand, and wakes late in August, when spring is well\r\nunderway. Then for seven months it grows fat on insects.\r\n\r\nThe creature is reportedly capable of living for 500 years and more.\r\nIt shares its longevity with its distant relatives, the great turtles.\r\nIts long life, during most of which it continues to breed, doubtless\r\nhas been a major factor in its racial survival.\r\n\r\nThe ancient reptiles were plentiful when white men first came to New\r\nZealand early in the last century. The Maoris regarded them with\r\nsuperstitious awe and avoided them as much as possible. But early\r\nBritish settlers and their dogs used to kill the inoffensive creatures\r\nfor sport. This was the first active enmity the tuateras ever had\r\nknown. They saved themselves by withdrawing to the barren islands and\r\nbecoming even more seclusive in their ways of life. Thus they clung to\r\na thin thread of existence until an enlightened government threw the\r\nprotection of the law around them.\r\n\r\nToday the three-eyed lizard is probably the world’s most rigidly\r\nprotected animal. The New Zealand government has placed all sorts of\r\nlegal restrictions on hunting or capturing it, and to kill one would be\r\na major crime. For that matter, very few persons living ever have seen\r\na tuatera. It stays in seclusion most of the time. There is a single\r\nspecimen in the zoological park at Wellington. When a party from a Byrd\r\nAntarctic expedition visited there they were told that the lizard had\r\nnot been seen for several months and that it was highly improbable that\r\nit could be lured out of hiding. One day it would appear of its own\r\nvolition, take a philosophical look at the twentieth century, eat a few\r\nflies, and retire to its lair under some rocks again. Here probably is\r\nthe secret of the race’s longevity. The little lizard has spent most of\r\nits time sleeping. It has existed with the minimum of effort. It has\r\nbeen satisfied with its lot and, above all, it never has gotten in the\r\nway. It has been observed, for example, that one of the creatures never\r\nclimbs over even the smallest obstacle. It always will walk around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prodigious Fertility of Insects_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capacity of insects to reproduce is almost incalculable. A single\r\nover-wintering house fly theoretically might have 5,598,729,000,000\r\ndescendants in a single year. It has been calculated that a single\r\ncabbage aphis, which weighs less than a thirtieth of an ounce, might\r\ngive rise in a year to a mass of descendants weighing 822,000,000 tons,\r\nabout five times as much as all the people in the world. Fortunately\r\nnearly all insects have an enormous mortality rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lizard That Runs Out of Its Own Skin_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an animal that can get out of its own skin. It is a little\r\nbrown lizard, a gecko, which lives in native houses on the Palau\r\nIslands in the South Pacific. This creature, about six inches long,\r\nis closely related to the house geckos, which are found throughout the\r\ntropical Pacific islands and as far north as Florida in the New World.\r\nThe Palau species is almost impossible to capture by hand.\r\n\r\nGrabbed by the tail, it immediately sheds that organ. This is a rather\r\ncommon practice among certain lizards and apparently brings little\r\ninconvenience. A new tail can be grown. But as soon as a hand is laid\r\non this particular species it immediately and literally “runs out of\r\nits skin.” This is done with lightning-like rapidity. The would-be\r\ncaptor is left holding the animal’s empty skin. All the rest of the\r\nlizard is running away, presumably seeking a hiding place.\r\n\r\nThis “running out of the skin” is a far different phenomenon than\r\nthat of shedding the skin by various reptiles, which always takes\r\nplace after a new skin has been formed underneath. The gecko just\r\nabandons its skin altogether. It flays itself alive. Escape in this way\r\napparently is suicidal in most cases. That it ever could grow back a\r\ncomplete skin is highly improbable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_High Living in the Himalayas_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highest land-dwelling animals on earth are small, black attid\r\nspiders. They live in islands of broken rock on Mount Everest at an\r\naltitude of 22,000 feet. This is far above the line of perpetual snow\r\nand nearly a mile above the last vegetation. Since there is no other\r\nliving thing near them, they have to eat one another for sustenance.\r\nPresumably their ranks always are being repleted by new arrivals from\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nHighest of all living things are red-legged, black-feathered choughs,\r\nbirds of the crow family. A lone chough has been seen in the Himalayas\r\nat 27,000 feet. There is an intimate association between these birds\r\nand mountain sheep. The chough sits on the sheep’s back and searches\r\nits hair for insects. The sheep seems to like this attention and stands\r\nstill while the exploration is in progress.\r\n\r\nAnother bird-animal association at high mountain altitudes is that\r\nbetween mouse hares, rabbit-like animals about the size of large rats,\r\nand finches. The hares live in burrows and usually are seen feeding at\r\nthe entrances or running from hole to hole. Both hares and birds are\r\nseed eaters.\r\n\r\nWild sheep and mountain goats in the Himalayas struggle up to about\r\n17,000 feet. There are small, wingless grasshoppers at 18,000 feet. A\r\nfew bees, moths and butterflies are found at 21,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barking Spider Monkeys_\r\n\r\n\r\nBarking spider monkeys that fight off unwelcome human invaders are\r\ndominant animals in the “green mansions” of Panama jungles. They live\r\nin semi-nomadic troops, each of which occupies a fairly restricted\r\narea of the forest, sometimes overlapping slightly with areas of other\r\ngroups. Within their territory members of a troop wander freely, but\r\ntheir activities tend to center around food and lodge trees.\r\n\r\nIn reporting on his observations of their activities Dr. C. R.\r\nCarpenter of Columbia stated: “Almost every night the group slept\r\nwithin earshot of camp. For eight successive nights they returned to\r\nthe same group of trees. Throughout the day the troop travelled, in\r\ngeneral, over the same routes from one food tree to another and from\r\nfavorite places in the deep forest where the midday siesta occurred.\r\nSeveral other groups were regularly located in their own particular\r\nhome areas.”\r\n\r\nThe monkeys resent intrusion of their territories by anything that\r\nlooks like another monkey, such as a man. When approached they start\r\nbarking. The usual terrier-like bark of great excitement may change\r\nto a metallic chatter repeated with great frequency. When males,\r\nand sometimes adult females are approached closely they growl in a\r\nstrikingly vicious manner. Typically they come to the terminal ends of\r\nbranches, often within 40 to 50 feet of the observer, and vigorously\r\nshake these branches. Both hands and feet may be used while the animal\r\nhangs by its tail.\r\n\r\nThrowing of branches is a conspicuous part of the reactions to men.\r\nQuite frequently they break off and drop limbs close to the intruder.\r\nGreen branches sometimes, but most often large dead limbs weighing\r\nup to ten pounds may be dropped. “This behavior,” according to Dr.\r\nCarpenter, “cannot be described as throwing although the animal may\r\ncause the object to fall away from the perpendicular by a sharp twist\r\nof its body or a swinging circular movement of its powerful tail.\r\nThis dropping of objects from trees may be considered as a defensive\r\nadaptation arising from the more generalized habit of shaking branches.\r\nA significant variation occurs when the animal breaks off a limb and\r\nholds it for a time—from a second to half a minute—before letting it\r\nfall.”\r\n\r\nNormally the monkeys travel along the upper surfaces of limbs, using\r\nall four feet and carrying the tail arched over the back. When crossing\r\nfrom one tree to another they use their powerful tails to support\r\nthemselves from limbs. During such movements hands, arms and tails\r\nare used at the same time to make contacts with supports. The monkeys\r\nhave a strong tendency to keep their heads upward. Therefore, when\r\ncoming down a perpendicular limb, vine or tree trunk they go backwards\r\nrather than head foremost. They frequently make long jumps outward and\r\ndownward, covering at times more than thirty feet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Insect That is Born Pregnant_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong nature’s weirdest tricks is the strange phenomenon known as\r\nmerokinosis, reported for a single family of almost microscopic\r\ninsects. The little creatures are fathers and mothers before they are\r\nborn. They are a species of mite which infests grass. They belong to a\r\nfamily which, almost alone among insects, gives birth to living young.\r\n\r\nNearly all insects are egg layers. The eggs, usually deposited in\r\nenormous numbers, hatch outside the body of the mother. Then the\r\nindividuals go through a series of metamorphoses—nymph, larva and the\r\nlike—before reaching their own reproductive maturity.\r\n\r\nThese grass mites, however, are born fully adult animals. A sack on the\r\nbody of the female swells until it is about 500 times the original body\r\nsize. It is filled with eggs and a nutritive fluid. Within this sack\r\nthe eggs hatch and the new generation passes through all the ordinary\r\nstages of insect metamorphosis. Finally, when they are fully mature,\r\nthe mother dies, the sack breaks, and the host of new mites emerges.\r\n\r\nIt was long thought that the mites were striking examples of\r\nparthenogenesis, or asexual reproduction. Females isolated as soon as\r\nthey were born gave birth to large numbers of young. Parthenogenisis\r\nis not uncommon among the lower animals. Invariably however, except in\r\nthis one case, all the offspring are of one sex. The supposedly virgin\r\nbirth families of the mites contain both males and females in various\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bull-dog Animals_\r\n\r\n\r\nA repressed tendency towards the bulldog face apparently is deep-seated\r\namong mammals. Foxes, cattle and pigs with bulldog appearance have been\r\nreported. In three species of dogs—the bulldog, pug and the pug-nosed\r\ndog of ancient Peru—this characteristic is dominant. It could have been\r\ncaused by a pronounced shortening of the rostral portion of the skull\r\ndue to the failure of facial bones to develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foresight of Kangaroo Rats_\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent report by Dr. William T. Shaw tells of observations of giant\r\nCalifornia kangaroo rats whose food consists largely of the seeds of\r\npepper grass. The seeds are gathered busily all day and stored in\r\nshallow surface caches where they are dried by the dust and heat of the\r\nsun. During the night, the animals work busily removing the dried seed\r\nto much larger chambers deep underground where it is to be stored for\r\nthe winter. In some way the highly intelligent animal has learned the\r\nsecret of preventing mildew. Only a few other animals have mastered the\r\nsame technique; the beaver and cony dry their twigs in the sun before\r\nstoring them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Primitive Proturans_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proturans—blind, wingless minute bugs found under bark and in\r\nleaf litter—are earth’s most primitive insects. They are seldom\r\nseen and when they are noticed are likely to be mistaken for larvae\r\nof some other insect. So obscure are the creatures that they were\r\nnot discovered until early in the present century. They are about a\r\ntwentieth of an inch long, yellowish, and covered with a protective\r\nshell of chitin. Sluggish and slow-moving proturans have three pairs\r\nof legs, only two of which are used for locomotion. The front pair is\r\nheld up in front of the insect as it moves. These legs apparently serve\r\nthe purpose of the antennae found in all higher insect orders. They are\r\nprovided with primitive sense organs of touch. These little creatures\r\npresumably represent one of the earliest stages in insect evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Air-Conditioned Homes of Beavers_\r\n\r\n\r\nAir ventilation of homes appears to be an engineering accomplishment of\r\nbeavers. “The beaver hut seen from the outside,” according to Sigvald\r\nSalveson of Aamli, Nowayd, “appears to be so tight that it seems\r\nastonishing that the occupants can get sufficient air. In winter, when\r\nthe lodge is covered with snow and ice one would not think it possible\r\nthat the animals could live in apparently air-tight dwellings. Near\r\nmy home is a small lake where a beaver built a dam and a great lodge.\r\nIn the outlet of the lake the water was still open and I noticed the\r\nfootprints of beaver on the thin ice just beyond. Twigs and small\r\ntrunks were dragged to the open water, where the animals sat on the\r\nedge of the ice and took their meals. A fox had his usual track over\r\nthe lodge.\r\n\r\n“More and more snow fell and the hut was more and more hidden under the\r\nwhite blanket. Sometimes I noticed that the fox had gone to the top of\r\nthe dome and evidently sat there for a while. Near where he had sat\r\nwas a hole in the snow about half a foot in diameter and with thin ice\r\naround the edge. I found that the hole widened downward and ended on\r\nthe roof of the lodge. At the bottom the hole was at least two feet in\r\ndiameter and its walls were hard as ice. From this hole or chimney rose\r\nwarm steam, and the twigs and mud on the roof felt warm and damp to my\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Demon of Puerto Rico_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn deep sunless ravines of Puerto Rico’s Pandura mountains dwells the\r\ndemon frog. It is a ghostly voice from mountainsides strewn with great,\r\ndecomposing granite boulders and so thickly covered with tropical vines\r\nand bushes that it is almost impenetrable to man. Until twenty years\r\nago it was only a voice, for none of the strange little creatures ever\r\nhad been seen. The mere sight of the animal, according to many of the\r\nnatives, would be fatal.\r\n\r\n“One might as well try to bribe a mountaineer to catch a ghost as\r\na guajone. There is a strange quality in the voice which probably\r\nis largely responsible for the superstitious dread of the mountain\r\npeople,” according to Smithsonian Institution biologist Gerrit S.\r\nMiller, Jr.\r\n\r\n“It is strange enough when heard from the surface,” Miller reports,\r\n“but it becomes even more strange after one has climbed down into\r\nthe irregular and dangerous openings, which prove to be much larger\r\nand more cavernous than the surface appearance, with its dense and\r\ndeceptive covering of vegetation, could lead one to expect. With\r\nflashlights the frogs are easily found and caught as they crawl slowly\r\nover the damp, but not slippery surface of the granite.\r\n\r\n“To the natives they are objects of dread. One man said they were about\r\na foot long and armed with frightful teeth. Another assured me that\r\nanybody who saw one would die shortly afterwards. No offer of money\r\ncould induce the boys or men to go into the cavities in search of them.”\r\n\r\nThe little creature is fantastic in appearance, chiefly due to its\r\nlarge protruding eyes. The edge of the eyelid is white, making a thin\r\nwhite line around the eye. The iris is back and gold. The skin is\r\nlight brown above and nearly white underneath, but some specimens have\r\nblotches of yellow which add to the weird appearance.\r\n\r\nLiving as they do in the semi-darkness of mountain gullies, little\r\nis known of the life history and habits of these strange creatures.\r\nThe most notable characteristic of several specimens kept alive for\r\nobservation was the peculiar singing in a liquid note repeated six or\r\nseven times. It can best be imitated by whistling. This singing is\r\nbelieved to be part of the courtship behavior of males.\r\n\r\nThe demon frog has been given the scientific name of Eleutherodactylus\r\ncooki. It appears to have been especially adapted for life among the\r\nboulders of its restricted habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Man-Made Plants_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least a half dozen species of plants are man-made. They are hybrids\r\nwhich can transmit their basic and unique characters to future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe fact that what long was considered an impossibility in the plant\r\nkingdom has been achieved is revealed by Dr. H. Bentley Glass,\r\nprofessor of biology at Johns Hopkins University. With newly developed\r\ntechniques which make possible the doubling of chromosomes, bunches of\r\ngenes which are the units of heredity, the creation of species may be\r\njust at its threshold and man may take over control of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe definition of species, after all, is the ability to produce\r\noffspring with the major characteristics of the parents. The first\r\nsuccessful attempt, Dr. Glass says, was by a Russian geneticist\r\nabout 30 years ago. He crossed a radish and a cabbage and produced a\r\n“rabage.” When two rabages were mated they produced seed which sprouted\r\ninto other rabages.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the man who had been the first to cross one of the\r\ngreat barriers in biology, the rabage was a pretty poor specimen. It\r\nhad the prickly, uneatable leaves of the radish and the poor root\r\nsystem of the cabbage. Russian agricultural authorities had been led\r\nto expect great things. They were bitterly disappointed that the new\r\nvegetable did not fit into one of the five-year plans. The geneticist\r\nwas not heard of again and it is generally believed that he was\r\n“eliminated” as a reward for one of science’s greatest achievements.\r\n\r\nCreators of new species have fared somewhat better in other countries,\r\nespecially the United States, but they have not fared too well\r\nanywhere. In practically every case the new species they have created\r\nhave taken over the worst characters of the parent species. They have\r\nbeen of no commercial value. It is likely that about the same thing has\r\nhappened in nature throughout the milleniums.\r\n\r\nBut bad may be good. It all depends on the environment into which the\r\nnew species is born. Under the right circumstances, the rabage might\r\nhave superseded both radish and cabbage. That is, it might have been\r\nadapted to a change in environment in which both parent species would\r\nhave become extinct.\r\n\r\nAlthough no new animal species has yet been man-made there seems no\r\noverwhelming reason why this should not happen with some of the new\r\nchromosome-doubling drugs. However, a new kind of man is not likely.\r\nAmong higher animals the mechanism of heredity is very complex indeed.\r\nIt isn’t likely to happen in nature, in the face of atomic radiation.\r\nIt has been calculated that normally there is one human mutation per\r\ngeneration for each 50,000 individuals. The high probability is that\r\nthis mutation involves a recessive, or hidden, gene. Its effects do\r\nnot appear in the population until two persons carrying the same\r\nrecessive are mated. About 999 out of 1,000 recessive genes are “bad”\r\nand in due course will cause the extinction of the line in which they\r\nappear. In the long history of the race it is likely that everybody has\r\nfallen heir to one lethal gene, but it may be a long time making its\r\nappearance in family lines.\r\n\r\nMost of the genes in any given population, good or bad, are so hidden\r\nthat it is practically impossible to predict what the offspring of any\r\nparticular couple will be.\r\n\r\nThe recessive genes have vastly increased through the operation of\r\nhuman “melting pots” all over the world in the last few generations.\r\nOne result is that minority races tend to become absorbed in\r\nmajorities. Thus the relatively small American Negro population,\r\nwithout any further inter-marriage but purely through the cropping\r\nout of recessives already received from the white majority, will be\r\nentirely amalgamated in the more numerous race in approximately 2,000\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nGenetics is getting into the hands of scientists tools which can speed\r\nup the natural process of change about 1,000-fold and this may result\r\nin either good or evil. The good side is well illustrated by hybrid\r\ncorn—a plant which cannot be considered a new species. This lately has\r\nbeen carried to the point where corn with much more sugar in its stalks\r\nand only six instead of twelve feet high can be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Seal Migration_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great annual northward migration of the seals is one of the\r\nmost remarkable phenomena of animal life. It seems to be without\r\norganization and without leadership. Yet toward the end of March each\r\nyear the hundreds of thousands of cow seals and pups scattered over\r\nthousands of square miles of water start at about the same time in\r\nthree great groups bound for three specific places. It has been the\r\nsame for centuries, perhaps milleniums. Each animal moves at about the\r\nsame rate so that all arrive within a few days of each other. Unlike\r\nbirds, they do not move in compact masses. Three great herds exist.\r\n\r\nThe American herd of about 1,500,000 is by far the largest of the\r\nthree. It goes straight to the Pribiloffs, where it goes ashore on\r\ntwo almost barren islands—St Paul and St George. The Japanese herd,\r\nnumbering about 40,000, makes for Robben Island, off northern Japan.\r\nThe Russian herd, now estimated at about 200,000, goes to a few rocky\r\nislands of the Commander archipelago off Kamchatka.\r\n\r\nThe moving herds consist almost entirely of females and young. The\r\nbulls winter further north, tend to be solitary during the winter, and\r\nprecede the cows to the summer homes. The breeding season lasts for\r\nabout two months. During this time the bull never eats or touches a\r\ndrop of water. He never leaves the land. He arrives sleek and fat from\r\nthe ocean pasture and is able to survive entirely on stored energy.\r\nThis keeps him alive, even when he fights scores of terrible battles\r\nwith younger rivals. Towards the end of summer he naturally is a sorry\r\nlooking creature.\r\n\r\nOne day, actuated by some common impulse, cows and calves depart.\r\nThen the bulls, their arduous labors of race propagation over for ten\r\nmonths, draw back among the rocks for a long rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Magic Bark of the Cinchona Tree_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shadow of a pale Spanish lady, dead for almost three centuries, has\r\nreturned to the dense rain forests of the western slopes of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe shadow is that of the Countess of Chinchon, wife of the redoubtable\r\nDon Luiz Geronimo de Cabrera Bobadilla y Mendoza, colonial viceroy of\r\nPeru. She was dying of a strange disease in Lima in 1638. Her Jesuit\r\nconfessor, the story goes, gave a medicine to her doctor made from the\r\nbark of a common Peruvian tree. It supposedly saved her life and two\r\nyears later she returned to Spain, carrying with her some of the magic\r\nbark. Thus she gave to the world one of the supreme medicines of all\r\ntimes. A century later the Swedish botanist Linnaeus tried to pay a\r\ncompliment to the long-dead beauty but misspelled her name—calling her\r\ntree “cinchona”. Out of it came quinine.\r\n\r\nThe Andean forests remained for 200 years the only source of the magic\r\ndrug—quinine. The cinchona trees grew wild. They were stripped of bark\r\nrecklessly and became very scarce. By 1850 the price of quinine was $50\r\nan ounce and only the rich could afford to have malaria.\r\n\r\nThe British tried to transplant the tree in India and failed. Then\r\nDutch botanists obtained some seed, planted it in the East Indies,\r\nand developed high-yielding species. Soon this region became the sole\r\nsource of the world’s supply. The price dropped to 18 cents an ounce\r\nand the lands over which the long-dead Countess had ruled dropped out\r\nof the picture.\r\n\r\nNow South American countries, notably Venezuela and Bolivia, are\r\nreclaiming the crop with improved varieties of the cinchona tree, equal\r\nto the best produced by the Dutch. They are regaining rapidly the dead\r\nlady’s gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colombia’s Ant Tree_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the sparsely inhabited, tropical portion of eastern Colombia is an\r\nant tree known as the barrasanta. It is a small, slender tree with\r\nshowy, red flowers which grows 25 to 30 feet in height. Both trunk and\r\nbranches are hollow and filled with masses of vicious, biting ants. As\r\nsoon as the tree is disturbed the insects swarm upon the invader. As\r\na result the tree is generally left alone both by Indians and white\r\nsettlers. The ants are protected by the branches and in turn protect\r\nthe host with their fighting prowess.\r\n\r\nA curious shrub which grows out of enormous anthills found through the\r\nllanos region of western Colombia furnishes quite a different example\r\nof insect-plant association. The ants are “leaf cutters.” All other\r\nplant life avoids their immediate neighborhood. This particular shrub\r\nexudes a viscous, milky juice which traps any ants which try to climb\r\ntoward its leaves. Hence the insects have learned to leave it alone and\r\nit enjoys the rich ant hill soil without competition from any other\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Strange Behavior of Plants_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe behavior characteristics of some American plants are strange indeed.\r\n\r\nThe compass plant, a bristly perennial of the aster family which grows\r\nin abundance over the prairies, is a living compass. It turns the edges\r\nof its leaves in a general north-south direction. Another American\r\nplant, the wild lettuce, does the same thing. The result is that when\r\nthe intensity of sunlight is weakest in the morning and evening the\r\nflat surfaces of the leaves are in a position to receive the maximum\r\navailable amount of light. At noon, when there is more light than the\r\nplant needs, only the edges of the leaves are turned towards the sun.\r\n\r\nThen there is the English ivy which arranges its leaves in a mosaic\r\npattern so that about the greatest possible area is exposed to the\r\nlight. Other plants show equally precise adaptations to their light\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nIt is all associated with the process of photosynthesis—i.e., the\r\nmanufacture by the plant of carbohydrates out of carbon dioxide and\r\nwater in the presence of light. The strength of light needed for this\r\nprocess varies somewhat with the particular plant and its conditions.\r\nThe phenomenon is one of the most vital in creation, the transformation\r\nof the sun’s energy into the fuel of animal life. Without it life would\r\nbe impossible.\r\n\r\nSome plants work under high light intensities, such as those which\r\nmust adapt themselves on the desert areas of the southwestern United\r\nStates. Others thrive best in the subdued light of a dense forest. One\r\ncurious little moss grows in caves where there is almost no light at\r\nall. It is equipped with a plate of cells forming a battery of lenses\r\ncapable of focusing the scattered light on the bodies especially\r\nconcerned in carbohydrate formation. These are the chloroplasts which\r\ncontain the mysterious substance, chlorophyll, which acts as a catalyst\r\nfor action of sunlight on carbon dioxide and water. The shape and\r\narrangement of cells containing the chloroplasts are such that the\r\namount of chlorophyll exposed to the sunlight can be varied.\r\n\r\nA specially devised apparatus has been constructed in the Smithsonian\r\nlaboratory for quantitative studies of the way plants absorb carbon\r\ndioxide under different lighting conditions. Not only is the process\r\ngreatly effected by the intensity of the light, the experiments show,\r\nbut the wave length also is of paramount importance. The experimental\r\nplants are grown with their roots in a nutrient solution and their\r\ntops extending into a double-walled glass tube. They are furnished\r\nlight from surrounding lamps, so that the intensity and wave lengths of\r\nthe light can be varied as desired. Through the tube, air containing\r\ndifferent amounts of carbon dioxide can be passed. Thus every element\r\nof the process is under rigid control of the experimenters.\r\n\r\nThe experiment already has shown that the correct combination of wave\r\nlengths is of the utmost importance in making up synthetic light. Thus,\r\nregardless of the intensity, the ordinary electric light when used\r\nalone has been demonstrated to be a poor light source. Its maximum\r\nenergy occurs in the infrared region, below the limit of visibility,\r\nwhile that of sunlight falls in the green-blue region. If tomato\r\nplants are grown under high powered Mazda lamps in the Smithsonian’s\r\nspecial growth chambers, especially when the humidity is high, their\r\nleaves turn pale and almost white. Chlorophyll disappears under these\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Venezuela’s Nocturnal Orchid_\r\n\r\n\r\nA flower that opens only by moonlight is one of Venezuela’s plant\r\ncuriosities. It is an ivory-white, velvety orchid which depends\r\nentirely on nocturnal butterflies to sip its nectar while pollenization\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\nThe plant is one of 800 species of Venezuelan orchids. Among these\r\nis probably the prettiest and rarest of the orchid family, the\r\nmother-of-pearl flower, which can sometimes be found in the deep\r\njungles of the Gran Sabana area at altitudes of more than 3,000 feet.\r\n\r\nStill another high mountain variety has square petals with fringed\r\nedges. Another, found in the jungles of the Upper Orinoco, has blossoms\r\nmeasuring up to 16 inches in diameter. A unique Venezuelan orchid grows\r\nonly in water.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world there are more than 20,000 species of orchids, the\r\ngreat majority of which are found only in mountainous regions of the\r\ntropics. A few, however, grow as far north as the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Plant That Strikes Men Dumb_\r\n\r\n\r\nA plant cultivated in the gardens of the Venezuelan National University\r\nat Caracas might well be a boon to pestered husbands and harassed\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\nIt is described under the popular Spanish name of “planta del mudo.”\r\nIt looks like sugarcane. According to the probably exaggerated claims,\r\nanybody who chews the stem is stricken dumb for at least 48 hours,\r\npresumably due to some paralyzing effect on some part of the vocal\r\napparatus. It is not known whether anybody has tried to extract the\r\nmarvelous talk-stopping principle.\r\n\r\nAmerican botanists are unable to identify the plant. They explain,\r\nhowever, that the northern portion of South America long has been known\r\nas the world’s greatest storehouse of plants with strange physiological\r\neffects. There is one, for example, alleged to grow hair on bald heads,\r\nanother which makes everything look red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Combat of Moth and Shrew_\r\n\r\n\r\nA strange fight between a grey shrew, smallest of North American\r\nmammals, and a black “witch moth” has been described by Laurence M.\r\nHuey of the San Diego Society of Natural History.\r\n\r\nThe moth, with a wing spread of about four inches and a body size\r\nalmost equal to that of the shrew, was placed in a cage with the\r\nmammal. The shrew proved too much for the insect after the odds had\r\nbeen equalized by clipping a great part of the latter’s wings.\r\n\r\n“Even with this severe handicap”, reports Mr. Huey, “the moth still was\r\nvery strong and, as its body was so large, the shrew attacked it by\r\ngrasping one of its wing stubs, tugging with main strength, and hanging\r\non like a bulldog. Once, in a burst of spirited action, the shrew was\r\npitched half way across the cage. This only caused a more determined\r\nattack and the moth finally was killed and eaten.\r\n\r\n“Another moth, with a body about three-quarters of an inch long, was\r\nplaced in the cage. It had lost many of the scales from its wings and\r\nwas partially disabled. It could fly feebly, however, from one side of\r\nthe cage to the other. The shrew, apparently by its sense of hearing,\r\nkept following the course of the moth until its flight carried it about\r\ntwo inches above the little mammal. Then, with an almost invisible\r\nquickness, the animal sprang and seized the moth in the air, much as\r\na basketball player leaps to catch a ball high over his head. A few\r\ncrunches with the sharp-toothed jaws dispatched the moth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ferocious Snake Weasel_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom South Africa comes a report from Dr. Raymond B. Cowles of a fight\r\nbetween a deadly reptile and a little known mammal, the inyengelizi, or\r\nsnake weasel.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of the snake weasel, unknown in any zoo, is the Umzumbe\r\nValley in Natal Province, where it is one of the rarest of carnivores.\r\nNatives either refuse to bring in inyengelizis or demand exorbitant\r\nprices for their skins. All parts of the body are used in the native\r\npharmacopoeia and elders wear a narrow strip of the fur to ward off\r\nevil and bring good luck.\r\n\r\nLittle is known concerning the habits of the animal except that it\r\napparently frequents burrows of subterranean animals in gardens,\r\nsometimes is ploughed up, and will attack and kill large snakes.\r\n\r\nA reliable Zulu described to Dr. Cowles a fight between one of them and\r\na deadly mamba about seven feet long. He said he had been watching the\r\nsnake, basking in the sun in a coiled position. After a few moments a\r\nmovement in the bushes caught his attention and he saw an inyengelizi\r\ncautiously stealing towards the snake. When within a foot or two the\r\nanimal suddenly leaped upon the reptile and fastened its teeth just\r\nbehind the head where it clung during the ensuing wild struggle.\r\nAfter a few minutes it succeeded in killing the snake, whereupon it\r\nrelinquished its hold, performed its toilet, and left without eating\r\nany of its prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rabbit That Swims_\r\n\r\n\r\nLife history and habits of a swimming rabbit are the subject of a\r\nreport to the American Society of Mammologists. The animal is the\r\nlittle known marsh rabbit of the South Carolina coast. It spends most\r\nof its life on the tidal marshes and hence, alone of the rabbit family,\r\nhas become a partially aquarian animal. Almost strictly nocturnal in\r\nits habits, its ways of life hitherto have eluded naturalists.\r\n\r\nBy far the best known trait of the species is its liking for water.\r\nIndividuals sometimes are encountered in day time far out in one of\r\nthe coastal rivers. In summer when the water is warm they take to it\r\nreadily. They seldom are observed, however, swimming in cold water.\r\n\r\nIn fall and winter the little animal leads a precarious existence. It\r\nis the favorite food of the great marsh hawks, continuously circling\r\nover the swamps. When Spring comes the birds leave for the North, the\r\nsedges grow tall so as to conceal completely the timid little animals,\r\nand they are left in peace until the frosts of Autumn.\r\n\r\nGenerally the marsh rabbit is a home-loving creature but floods in the\r\nfresh water area of its habitat sometimes force a migration. It is a\r\nnatural swimmer. On land it walks with a swimming motion. Other rabbits\r\nare practically helpless in the water and try to swim with the hopping\r\nmotions they use on land. The rare special type appears to be holding\r\nits own in spite of its many enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gorilla Warriors of the Belgian Congo_\r\n\r\n\r\nA study of mountain gorillas in a part of the world which they have all\r\nto themselves has been reported by Captain C. S. R. Pitman, British\r\nzoologist.\r\n\r\nThe only humans who ever penetrate the dense forests on the Uganda\r\nborder of the Belgian Congo, where these animals are found, are\r\npigmies, with whom the great apes live on the best of terms. Captain\r\nPitman is one of the few white men ever to have entered the area.\r\n\r\nThe mountain gorilla is probably the highest of all the gorillas, next\r\nto man. One of the two or three ever in captivity was an infant kept\r\nat the National Zoological Park in Washington, D. C. Its brain was the\r\nlargest ever found in an infra-human creature; it almost matched the\r\nsmallest normal human brains.\r\n\r\nCapt. Pitman found the gorilla quite a likeable and peaceful animal. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“Around the male gorilla, on account of its enormous size and strength,\r\ncoupled in recent years with frequent lapses from grace provoked\r\nby unnecessary and undue interference, there has been woven and\r\nunfortunately published a fantasy of inaccuracy and exaggeration—so\r\nmuch so that the very homely old male is visualized as an object of\r\ndread. The male gorilla, as the family head, is most solicitous for the\r\nwelfare of his wives and children—a very human trait. On the threat\r\nof danger, he accepts full responsibility for the well-being of his\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n“If the danger is real the females and young are sent off, while the\r\nfather waits to take on all comers until satisfied that the remainder\r\nof the band are out of harm’s way. Sometimes, when the danger is sudden\r\nand overwhelming, the youngsters are sent up trees to hide until the\r\ntrouble is over. It is strangely reminiscent of the records of some\r\nof the early African explorers relative to tribal customs. When the\r\nwomenfolk were to be seen busily engaged in their usual vocations in\r\nthe precincts of a village all was well and no hostility contemplated\r\non the part of the local inhabitants.\r\n\r\n“But an absence of women and children was interpreted as unfavorable,\r\nsignifying that they had been removed to a safe place to enable the\r\nwarriors to fight unhampered. And so it is with the old male gorilla,\r\nfor as soon as he bids his family seek safety he is out for mischief,\r\nalthough without direct provocation he is unlikely to attack. There are\r\nblack sheep in every fold and solitary examples both male and female,\r\nwhich probably have been outlaws for a very good reason, have been\r\nknown to be abnormally aggressive.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Biggest “Rat” in the World_\r\n\r\n\r\nClose relative of the porcupine, but without quills, is the aquatic\r\ncoypu, or nutria, of South America. It has become quite valuable in\r\nrecent years because of its soft fur. Weighing about 20 pounds, it\r\noften is referred to as the “biggest rat in the world”. It shares with\r\nthe porcupine large, orange-colored incisor teeth which give it a\r\nfrightful appearance. Like its barbed northern cousin it is a strict\r\nvegetarian, living exclusively on water weeds in its native habitat.\r\nBefore the last war coypu farms were being established through much\r\nof Europe. However some apprehension was felt that it might cause\r\nconsiderable damage to crops if it escaped from its enclosures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Suicide Marches of Lemmings_\r\n\r\n\r\nMass death marches of lemmings long have intrigued biologists and\r\npsychologists.\r\n\r\nThe Lapland lemming is a short-tailed animal, related to the meadow\r\nmouse, that looks like a miniature rabbit. Through the sub-Arctic\r\nwinter it lives completely buried under snow through which it burrows\r\nin search of mosses and lichens.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely prolific; females produce two litters of from four to\r\nsix offspring every year. The numbers soon become far too great to\r\nsubsist on the sparse supply available in the Scandinavian mountains.\r\n\r\nThen, irregularly in periods of from five to ten years, occurs one of\r\nthe weirdest phenomena of animal life. Acting apparently on a common,\r\nsub-conscious, simultaneous impulse, the entire lemming population\r\nstarts a mass migration out of the mountains to the lowlands. The\r\nanimals proceed in a straight line, a few feet apart, each usually\r\ntracing a shallow furrow in the soil. They are a devouring scourge,\r\nstripping the earth of all vegetation in their path. Their progress\r\nseems irresistible. No obstacle stops them. If they come across a\r\nman they glide between his legs. If they meet with a haystack they\r\ngnaw through it. If a rock stands in their way they go around it in a\r\nsemi-circle and then resume the straight line of their march. When they\r\ncome to a lake, river or arm of the sea they swim directly across, vast\r\nnumbers being drowned on the way. If they encounter a boat they climb\r\nover it, so as not to be diverted from a straight line. Curiously,\r\nthey seem to avoid human habitations. They resist fiercely all efforts\r\nto stop them. They will bite a stick or hand, crying and barking like\r\nlittle dogs. Multitudes are destroyed every mile of the way. When the\r\nmigrating horde reaches the sea it moves straight on—to inevitable\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nA few linger behind and eventually make their way back to the mountain\r\nhabitat. Numbers are so reduced that they are seldom observed. Then a\r\nnew generation starts and builds up for the next migration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ferocity of the Tiger_\r\n\r\n\r\nSymbol of ferocity in the animal world is the tiger. When troops of the\r\nAmerican 101st Division entered the German city of Halle in 1945 it\r\nprobably was considered effective psychological warfare tactics on the\r\npart of the Nazis to open the zoo cages and let loose the tigers. So\r\nfar as known, however, the animals did not attack any Americans.\r\n\r\nWhether the reputation of the tiger is entirely justified is debatable.\r\n“The tiger”, says Dr. William M. Mann, long-time director of the\r\nNational Zoological Park in Washington, “is one of the finest animals\r\nthat lives. In the cage he is the most snobbish of all aristocrats, his\r\ncontempt for those who jostle in front of his bars being nothing less\r\nthan magnificent. He is dignity itself. He condescends to no boyish\r\nantics to attract attention as does the chimpanzee, to no begging\r\nfor sweets as do the bear and elephant, to no pacific, philosophic\r\nacceptance of fate such as that of the hippopotamus. You cannot win his\r\nfavor by a stick of candy. He is above rage or gratitude.”\r\n\r\nSometimes adult tigers are captured in traps and sold to circuses. One\r\nAmerican circus some years ago had a cage of ten. Their keeper made\r\nthem perform as another man might spaniels. In the arena they appeared\r\nto be a ferocious group. In the menagerie tent, confined in small cages\r\nlike so many kittens, the keeper could put his hand in their months and\r\nrub their teeth. Once he complained bitterly about the tranquility of\r\nhis charges. “I cannot make a show with ten tame tigers,” he argued. “I\r\nmust have five mean ones to add to the act.”\r\n\r\nThe tiger had a prominent part in the menageries of Indian and Chinese\r\nmonarchs before the Christian era. It first appeared in Europe about\r\nthe time of the eastern conquests of Alexander. Well known to the\r\nRomans, the animal was one of the most dreaded of all the beasts that\r\nappeared in the arena.\r\n\r\nDespite its supposed ferocity, no great harm has been done in the few\r\ncases in which tigers have escaped from zoos. Often they have returned\r\nof their own accord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fearsome Porcupine_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more than 1,000 minute barbs on each of a porcupine’s many\r\nquills. This is the reason why such a quill is very difficult to\r\nwithdraw from the flesh. The armament of quills, from a half inch to\r\nthree inches long and developed from hairs of the underfur, renders the\r\n“spiny pig” of northern woodlands almost immune to attack. About its\r\nonly enemy in nature is the giant weasel, the fisher, which has learned\r\nthe trick of quickly turning the porcupine on its back.\r\n\r\nThe quills are very lightly attached to the porcupine’s body and become\r\ndetached almost automatically when the creature is attacked. That they\r\ncan be “shot”, however, is almost certainly a fallacy. A victim must\r\nactually be in contact with the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Plant That Stimulates Visions_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1560 a Franciscan monk wrote of Aztecs eating a plant called peyotl\r\n“which gives them terrible and ludicrous visions, alleviates hunger and\r\nthirst, gives strength and incites to battle.” It was used, he reported\r\n“to bring about a state of ecstasy in which one had prophetic visions.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first known reference in literature to the mescal cactus,\r\n_Lopophora williamsii_, whose remarkable effects on the human mind\r\never since have aroused wonderment. Many have experimented with eating\r\nthe so-called “buttons” of this cactus and have reported all sorts of\r\nterrible and ludicrous visions. But no two experimenters apparently\r\nhave the same experience. After nearly 400 years the supposed active\r\nprinciple, mescaline, has been extracted and the same effects produced\r\neither by swallowing or injection of as little as a half gram.\r\n\r\nFirst comes a decided nausea which lasts about two hours. This\r\npasses and is followed by weird hallucinations. One’s own body seems\r\ndistorted, with some parts exceedingly small and some very large. A\r\ncommon experience is the feeling that only one’s head is the self. The\r\nrest of the body is away somewhere in space. The time sense is badly\r\ndistorted. Minutes stretch out into hours and days, days and hours are\r\ncontracted into minutes. There are strange optical delusions—lights\r\nflashing before the eyes and floating patches of color. Seldom,\r\nhowever, are actual hallucinatory objects seen.\r\n\r\nThe consumer has the impression that he thinks more clearly than at\r\nother times but it has been found that this thought is based more on\r\nthe sounds than meaning of words. There is a tendency, for example, to\r\nargue in puns. An invisible barrier seems to separate one from the rest\r\nof the world. This condition lasts for two or three hours, and then\r\npasses away, leaving no after affects. The condition has been likened\r\nto schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nLarge doses produce catatonic conditions. A person may sit motionless\r\nfor a long time in an apparently quite uncomfortable position and\r\nrefuse to move. Dogs and cats given mescaline injections crouch\r\nmotionless in corners of their cages, only rousing themselves from time\r\nto time to attack invisible assailants.\r\n\r\nIt recently has been found that only one chemical constituent of\r\nmescaline, beta-phenylethylamine, is responsible for the delusions.\r\nThis is quite similar in chemical structure to the body hormone\r\nadrenaline. There have been conjectures that adrenaline may be changed\r\ninto the mescaline constituent by some as yet unknown process of body\r\nchemistry and that this change may be the physiological cause of\r\nschizophrenia.\r\n\r\nAbout 40 years ago a peyotl church was set up by Indians in New Mexico.\r\nIt followed essentially the Catholic ritual, but with mescal buttons\r\nsubstituted for bread in communion. The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs\r\ndid not interfere with the rites when its investigations indicated that\r\nthe mysterious drug was not habit-forming and apparently caused no\r\nphysical injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Puzzling Platypus_\r\n\r\n\r\nFantastic combination of mammal, bird and reptile is the egg-laying,\r\ntoothless water animal of New South Wales and Tasmania, Australia,\r\nthe duck-billed platypus. It is clearly a mammal but, with a single\r\nexception, it stands quite alone among these warm-blooded animals. The\r\ncreatures from which it is a survivor probably have been extinct for\r\nfifty million years.\r\n\r\nIt is an animal about twenty inches long from the tip of its horny beak\r\nto the end of its broad, flattened tail. It is covered with soft brown\r\nfur. Its four legs are short and five-toed. These toes on the front\r\nfoot are joined by webs like those of aquatic birds which extend beyond\r\nthe long, sharp, curved toe-nails. On the hind legs of the male are\r\ninch-long, sharp spurs through which run minute canals connected with\r\na large gland at the back of the thigh—very much like the poison fangs\r\nof a serpent. Yet, so far as can be determined, the gland secretes no\r\npoison and the spurs apparently are seldom used in self defense.\r\n\r\nThe female lays two eggs at a time, each about three-fourths of an inch\r\nlong and a half inch wide, with strong, flexible white shells. These\r\neggs are not incubated but hatch buried shallowly in sand and straw.\r\nThe platypus lives on the banks of ponds and quiet streams where it\r\ndigs burrows as much as 20 feet long with two entrances, one below and\r\nthe other above the water level. The rear, or land, end of a burrow is\r\nenlarged into a small chamber in which the young are reared.\r\n\r\nThe creatures pass most of the daylight hours asleep in these burrows,\r\ncurled in rather tight balls. The entrances are concealed in grass and\r\nreeds so that the occupants of the burrows are seldom seen. At night\r\nthe platypus takes to the water. It swims and dives easily and its\r\nmajor food consists of worms and other aquatic animals found in the mud\r\nor gravel at the bottom. It has cheek pouches like a squirrel. When it\r\ncomes up from a dive these pouches are stuffed with the food it has\r\ngathered, which is extracted and eaten at leisure.\r\n\r\nAdult animals are toothless but in each jaw there is a horny ridge.\r\nThe young, however, have rootless teeth—a possible clue to their very\r\nremote ancestry. Like a bird the platypus has a very small head. There\r\nis no division of its brain into two hemispheres, as in all other\r\nmammals and most birds. This is a characteristic of the reptile brain.\r\n\r\nThe creatures can climb with apparent ease. Small groups sometimes are\r\nseen sunning themselves on broad tree trunks overhanging the water.\r\nThey are extremely timid but, when captured, soon become quite tame. In\r\ncaptivity, however, they seldom live long.\r\n\r\nThe only other member of this animal group is the echidna, or spiny ant\r\neater, of the same part of the world. It is, however, an inhabitant\r\nof rocky districts where it digs shallow burrows in sand or hides in\r\nrock crevices. The back is covered with sharp, backward-directed spines\r\nwhich give it the appearance of a small porcupine. It has a long,\r\ntubular snout from which projects the long, slender tongue covered with\r\nsome sticky substance. With this it laps up ants and other insects.\r\n\r\nLike the platypus, it has short, strong legs with large claws with\r\nwhich it burrows with considerable speed. Burrowing, where possible, is\r\nits usual method of flight. Its other defense is to roll itself in a\r\nball, when its sharp spines give it considerable protection. “The only\r\nway of carrying the creature”, says George Bennett (_Gatherings of a\r\nNaturalist in Australasia_) “is by one of its hind legs. Its powerful\r\nresistance and the sharpness of the spines will soon oblige the captor,\r\nattempting to seize it by any other part of the body, to be relinquish\r\nhis hold.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abominable Snow Man, 155\r\n\r\n  Ants, 6, 31, 36, 62, 71\r\n\r\n  Aphroditids, 39\r\n\r\n  Asp, 26\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bats, 121, 124\r\n\r\n  Bear, 133\r\n\r\n  Beavers, 185\r\n\r\n  Bees, 135, 144\r\n\r\n  Beetles, 142, 158\r\n\r\n  Birds, 27, 34, 43, 54, 55, 62, 70, 77, 81, 89, 96, 97, 102, 110\r\n\r\n  Brachiopods, 52\r\n\r\n  Bryozoa, 15\r\n\r\n\r\n  Caterpillars, 150\r\n\r\n  Caves, 3, 43, 57\r\n\r\n  Centipedes, 126\r\n\r\n  Chameleon, 9\r\n\r\n  Clams, 111, 113\r\n\r\n  Corals, 114\r\n\r\n  Crabs, 18, 125\r\n\r\n  Crocodile, 176\r\n\r\n  Ctenophores, 118\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dodo, 55\r\n\r\n  Dogs, 169\r\n\r\n  Duck Hawk, 97\r\n\r\n  Dugongs, 172\r\n\r\n\r\n  Eagle, 103, 162\r\n\r\n  Elephant, 93, 117, 120, 194\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fireflies, 164\r\n\r\n  Fish, 13, 33, 72, 89, 99, 143, 148, 156\r\n\r\n  Flowers, 31\r\n\r\n  Forests, 20, 42, 119\r\n\r\n  Frogs, 24, 160, 162, 167, 186\r\n\r\n\r\n  Gorilla, 194\r\n\r\n  Grasshopper, 113, 128, 130, 157\r\n\r\n  Guacharo, 43\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hornbills, 34\r\n\r\n  Horned Viper, 26, 162\r\n\r\n\r\n  Iguanas, 41\r\n\r\n  Insects, 26, 139, 181, 184\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lemmings, 196\r\n\r\n  Lizards, 30, 41, 174, 179, 180\r\n\r\n  Locusts, 128, 130\r\n\r\n\r\n  Manatees, 172\r\n\r\n  Mantid, 163\r\n\r\n  Mermaids, 172\r\n\r\n  Millipedes, 123\r\n\r\n  Mollusk, 165\r\n\r\n  Monkeys, 21, 37, 141, 183\r\n\r\n  Moth, 191\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ocean, 47\r\n\r\n  Octracoderms, 33\r\n\r\n  Opossum, 170\r\n\r\n  Orchids, 122, 191\r\n\r\n  Oysters, 117\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pearls, 112\r\n\r\n  Penguins, 5\r\n\r\n  Pigeons, 27\r\n\r\n  Plants, 46, 78, 108, 131, 137, 139, 149, 150, 154, 159, 187, 190, 192\r\n\r\n  Platypus, 199\r\n\r\n  Porcupine, 197\r\n\r\n  Proteus, 57\r\n\r\n  Proturans, 185\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rabbit, 192\r\n\r\n  Rats, 137, 141, 184, 195\r\n\r\n  Raven, 89\r\n\r\n  Reptiles, 61\r\n\r\n  Rotifers, 85\r\n\r\n\r\n  Salamander, 178\r\n\r\n  Sea Horse, 82\r\n\r\n  Sea Urchin, 50\r\n\r\n  Seals, 84, 161, 188\r\n\r\n  Shark, 134, 138\r\n\r\n  Shrew, 181\r\n\r\n  Silk Worm, 98\r\n\r\n  Skuas, 110\r\n\r\n  Snails, 44, 109, 152\r\n\r\n  Snakes, 26, 49, 77, 88, 105, 162, 174\r\n\r\n  Spiders, 9, 15, 30, 41, 67, 91\r\n\r\n  Sponge, 2\r\n\r\n  Squids, 67\r\n\r\n  Sting Rays, 89, 146\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tamandua, 21\r\n\r\n  Tarantula, 30\r\n\r\n  Termites, 45, 115, 137\r\n\r\n  Ticks, 20\r\n\r\n  Tiger, 196\r\n\r\n  Toads, 159, 162\r\n\r\n  Tomato, 92\r\n\r\n  Toucan, 108\r\n\r\n  Trees, 129, 141, 189, 190\r\n\r\n\r\n  Viper, 26, 162\r\n\r\n\r\n  Weasel, 193\r\n\r\n  Whippoorwill, 70\r\n\r\n  Worms, 10, 22, 51, 64, 73, 90, 98, 132, 142, 151, 157, 158",
