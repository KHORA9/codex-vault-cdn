Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO\r\n  HENRY BOULEY,\r\n  MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE OF PARIS,\r\n\r\nThis little practical work is respectfully dedicated in testimony of the\r\ncontinued esteem and respectful remembrance of one who was fortunate in\r\nbeing numbered among his former students, by\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presenting this concise treatise upon castration of the domestic\r\nanimals, it is not intended to offer new modes of operation, but merely\r\nto collect together the various methods in use and leave the reader to\r\nappreciate them at their value. It is a work which, it is believed, has\r\nnot yet been done in English veterinary literature, and on this account\r\nit is hoped will prove of interest and use to those engaged in that\r\nspecialty of veterinary surgery.\r\n\r\nIn gathering the material, advantage has been taken of several of the\r\nmost recent works of French and German writers on the subject, and\r\nplates have been obtained from the original and excellent wood cuts of\r\nZundel, and Peuch, and Toussaint.\r\n\r\nIn presenting this volume to the indulgence of veterinarians, it is with\r\npleasure that the author acknowledges and offers his sincere thanks to\r\nDr. Holt for the great assistance he has kindly given in revising the\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL CASTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL CASTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  DEFINITION -- ITS VARIOUS PURPOSES -- AN OLD OPERATION -- ITS HISTORY\r\n  -- CASTRATION OF NECESSITY -- CASTRATION OF FASHION AND CONVENIENCE --\r\n  ITS EFFECTS -- UPON THE GENERAL ORGANISM -- UPON SOME SPECIAL FUNCTION\r\n  -- UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANIMAL -- AGE AT WHICH IT OUGHT TO BE\r\n  PERFORMED -- SEASON MOST FAVORABLE -- PREPARATION OF THE PATIENT --\r\n  MODES OF RESTRAINT -- CASTING -- STANDING UP -- ANATOMY OF THE PARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the operations pertaining to the domain of Veterinary Surgery,\r\nwithout doubt the practitioner is most frequently called upon to\r\nperform--more especially in breeding districts--that of castration, the\r\ndestruction or removal of the essential organs of generation in our\r\ndomesticated animals. It is, however, not nearly so often resorted to\r\nfor purely surgical reasons as for purposes closely related to questions\r\nof agricultural and industrial economy, by reason of its effect upon the\r\nindividuals of the various species of animals subjected to it, in order\r\nto improve their value and increase their usefulness to mankind. And\r\nthat this is its practical effect is no modern discovery. As far back in\r\nantiquity as seven centuries preceding the Christian era, it was known\r\nand practised upon various animals. Of this we may find ample historical\r\nproof in the writings of Roman, Greek, and Oriental authors, where\r\nspecific mention appears of the various methods employed, including the\r\nprocesses of excision, of crushing and of tearing. Even the castration\r\nof females was known to our less remote ancestors, the Danes having in\r\nthe sixteenth century performed it on sheep, swine, cows, and even\r\nmares. The spaying of cows, however, seems to have been forgotten about\r\nthe beginning of the present century, and it was not until the year 1831\r\nthat Thomas Winn, of Natchez (Louisiana), and afterwards Levrat (of\r\nLausanne), brought it to the attention of veterinarians, as a means for\r\nthe improvement of the milky secretion in cows.\r\n\r\nThe operation may be considered under two distinct heads. Under the\r\nfirst it is to be considered as one of _necessity_, as when performed\r\nwith a therapeutic object in view; as, for example, when it constitutes\r\none of the first steps involved in the surgical treatment of\r\nstrangulated hernia, or of diseased conditions of the testicles or\r\novaries, such as orchitis, epididymitis, sarcocele, hydrocele, cyst,\r\netc. In the other case it is resorted to for reasons of mere _fashion_\r\nand _convenience_, and has for its object the production of such a\r\nmodification of the general organism as shall increase the adaptedness\r\nof the animals subjected to it to the uses to which they are applied;\r\nwhen, of course, the economic becomes the paramount and exclusive reason\r\nfor thus interfering with the obvious creative purpose. It is the\r\noperation as performed under this general heading that we shall now\r\nprincipally consider.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this latter object it must be borne in mind that the\r\noperation is followed by certain peculiar effects, which may either\r\nmanifest themselves upon the entire organism, or upon some special\r\nfunctions only. In the first instance it is quite evident that the\r\nprimary and most obvious effect of the mutilation is to be discovered in\r\nthe character and disposition of the animal, which at once becomes in a\r\ndouble sense an “altered” creature, docile and submissive, and entirely\r\nwilling to become the obedient and useful servant of his human master.\r\nBut it is not alone that we find the vicious stallion, the\r\nuncontrollable bull, the kicking jackass, the dangerous boar, and even\r\nthe hysteric mare and cow transformed into the useful gelding, the quiet\r\nox, the patient donkey, and the “fatherly” barrow, the quiet working\r\nmare and the productive cow, as the result of the change which the\r\ncharacter--the nervous system, in fact--has undergone. Besides this,\r\nother marked changes are to be observed of a more distinctly physical\r\ncharacter, such as a modification of the entire organism, manifested in\r\nthe external symmetry, and the expressive physiognomy of the creature,\r\nwhen deprived of its virility.\r\n\r\nThe animal becomes more quiet, and its general form is modified. If\r\naltered at an early age, the skeleton will be arrested in its growth,\r\nand the mass of muscles attached to it will participate in the defective\r\ndevelopment; the head will become elongated, the legs will continue to\r\nbe lighter, and the body will show a corresponding lack of development.\r\nIn other words, the male animal will tend to assume the characters of\r\nthe female, in form and feature, the gelding, indeed, resembling the\r\nmare, not only in the _ensemble_ of his appearance, but in his voice,\r\nwhich loses the resonance of the stallion’s, and his physiognomy, which\r\nbecomes milder and less expressive; while his neck is lighter and his\r\nmane more scanty, with the hairs which compose it more fine and silky.\r\n\r\nA like tendency exists in other male animals to acquire a resemblance to\r\nthe female as an effect of the operation of castration. The altered bull\r\nhas a weak and feminine voice; his head is narrower and elongated; his\r\nhorns become lengthened and more curved; he has exchanged his wild and\r\nthreatening aspect for a mild and gentle visage; his neck also is\r\nlighter and his chest narrower; his bony structure is less massive; and\r\nhe has, besides all the rest, acquired a quality of essential importance\r\nto mankind in a dietetic view, that of accumulating fat. This last\r\nphenomenon shows us that besides the other changes referred to, there\r\nis an important modification of the nutritive forces of the animal, or\r\nat least a change in the direction of their action.\r\n\r\nWhen thus deprived of his virile functions the animal ceases, in effect,\r\nto exist as one of a species, but maintains an essentially individual\r\nlife, in which the assimilable nutriment which he absorbs, instead of\r\nbeing in part appropriated to the office of reproduction of his kind, is\r\nall devoted to his own individual conservation. In animals not used for\r\ndraught purposes, or in other labor, when the food received is nearly\r\nalways in excess of the amount required for the support of the organism,\r\nthe result follows that the surplus of nutritive substances (found\r\nsometimes in great abundance) becomes stored in the connective tissue\r\nand intermuscular structure, and that in this way the flesh assumes\r\nsuperior and more nutritious qualities than that of the unaltered\r\nanimal, while, at the same time, it loses the strong and peculiar odor\r\nfrequently communicated to it by the presence of the testicular\r\napparatus and secretion in the entire animal.\r\n\r\nThis property of modification of function is probably still better\r\nillustrated in the effect of the operation upon cows, where we shall\r\nfind not only the power of accumulation of fat increased by castration,\r\nbut, above all, the milky secretion improved both in quality and\r\nquantity, and also in the duration of the flow.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE.\r\n\r\nThe question, “at what age can an entire animal be altered?” admits of a\r\nsimple answer, to wit, “as soon as the testicles can be easily\r\nreached--as soon as they appear outside of the abdominal cavity, and are\r\nfound in the inguinal canal.” But although it can be performed at that\r\nepoch, or deferred to any period of after life, it must be remembered\r\nthat it is easier and less dangerous in young than in older animals, and\r\nthat with the former it is a simple operation, producing, ordinarily, no\r\nnoticeable alteration in the other functions, and but rarely followed by\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nA period between eighteen months and two years is generally preferred\r\nfor horses, though, according to some authors, even a much earlier date\r\nmay be chosen, some English veterinarians being accustomed to operate at\r\nas early a date as ten days from birth. It is immaterial, however, at\r\nwhat precise time the operation may be performed, since it is a conceded\r\npoint that the earlier it is done the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASON.\r\n\r\nWhen it is possible to choose the season most favorable for the\r\noperation, and for securing the best chances of recovery, the spring, or\r\nthe early stages of the fall, are those to which the operator should\r\ngive the preference, provided the atmospheric temperature is moderate\r\nand not susceptible to sudden variations. It is to be remembered that at\r\nsome periods of the year, without any known or apparent cause, a\r\ntendency appears in wounds to take on gangrenous or septicemic\r\ncomplications which are not so generally observed in the mild weather of\r\nspring and early fall. Another essential condition which surgeons will\r\ndo well to take into consideration is the general health of the subject,\r\nas in all cases of surgical interference, any diseased tendency already\r\nexisting (perhaps latent) in the patient, such as an anæmic condition, a\r\ngourmy predisposition, or typhoid susceptibility are likely to give rise\r\nto the development of serious and perhaps fatal sequelæ to an operation\r\nwhich, simple as it may be in itself, is nevertheless not without\r\ndanger, or of possible complications of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe preparations to which the animal is to be subjected previous to\r\nundergoing the operation are the same as those which are required in\r\nother cases of surgical manipulation. Some portions of the preparations\r\nare, perhaps, of even greater importance, and may not, on any account,\r\nbe overlooked, when we take into consideration the peculiar position in\r\nwhich the animal must frequently be secured in order effectually to\r\ncontrol his movements. Hence, a low diet for twenty-four hours preceding\r\nthat appointed for the operation, and an empty stomach at the time of\r\ncastration, with a thorough washing of the sheath, are precautions which\r\nno surgeon entitled to the name will overlook or neglect, especially\r\nwhen a soliped is to be subjected to the knife. We shall discuss\r\nhereafter the indications in the case of the castration of large\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESTRAINT.\r\n\r\nTwo modes of restraint are employed in securing the animals during the\r\nmanipulations for the removal of the testicles, one which is applied to\r\nall the various methods yet to be described, and the other applicable\r\nprincipally to the method of amputation of the cord by the use of the\r\n_écraseur_. In the former, the animal is thrown down and secured with\r\none of his hind legs fixed in a position in which the inguinal region is\r\nfully exposed. In the latter he is allowed to remain in a standing\r\nposture, and is kept quiet by the application of a twitch upon his upper\r\nlip. As the first mode of securing the patient is the safest for all\r\nparties engaged in the undertaking, and from the further fact of its\r\napplicability in all methods of operating, we shall first consider it\r\nsomewhat in detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.\r\n\r\nCondition of the horse in lying posture. Steps to bring one of the hind\r\nlegs upon the corresponding front one.]\r\n\r\nBy veterinarians who employ the old method of casting with four hobbles,\r\nthe animal, being properly prepared, is thrown upon whichever side\r\ncorresponds with the operator’s habit of manipulation, whether with the\r\nright hand or the left, and the leg opposite to that on which he is\r\nlying being released from the hobble, is carried forward upon the\r\ncorresponding shoulder, as far as it can be safely done. To effect this\r\na loop of rope or platelonge is passed around the coronet, below the\r\nfetlock, the free end being carried forward over the dorsal border of\r\nthe neck, under the neck, towards its anterior border, and is then\r\ncarried back under the same hind leg, between the hinder extremities and\r\nover the hock, from the posterior border, where an assistant, stationed\r\nat the back of the animal, is ready to receive it (Fig. 1). By careful,\r\ngradual and steady pulling upon the rope the foot is brought forward\r\nupon the external surface of the shoulder, and there secured by two or\r\nthree turns of the rope around the coronet.\r\n\r\nBut it often occurs that in this position the inguinal region is not\r\nsufficiently exposed, and some of the steps of the operation may thus be\r\nrendered difficult, even when the surgeon has taken the precaution to\r\npose the body of the patient and place him partly on his back, by means\r\nof bundles of straw pressed under the side upon which he lies. Many\r\noperators prefer the use of the double side line, with which, when the\r\nanimal is thrown, both hind legs are brought forward together, and he is\r\nfixed squarely upon his back, and the inguinal region thus brought\r\ndistinctly into view. The manipulation is thereby made easier for the\r\nsurgeon, and, it is claimed, safer for the patient. The possibility of\r\ndanger attending these methods has led many veterinarians in Europe, and\r\nin the United States as well, to prefer the operation with the animal in\r\nthe standing posture. But it is to be considered that the same\r\ncomplications may rise in all instances, with the exception of\r\napprehended injury to the vertebral column, which, though possible, is\r\nalmost unknown, in fact, at the usual age of the castrated animal. It is\r\nto be considered, likewise, that the animal, on his feet, is free to\r\nstruggle as violently as he wishes, and is thus exposed to the risk of\r\nthe pulling and laceration of the spermatic cord, and a resulting\r\npredisposition to enlargements of that body and the formation of\r\nchampignons. When it is considered, again, that by the traction of the\r\ncord the superior opening of the inguinal canal is necessarily\r\ndilated, and the formation of a hernia of castration is liable to take\r\nplace, we submit the point to the intelligent judgment, whether, in the\r\npresence of these possibilities of extremely dangerous accidents, it\r\ndoes not become the duty of the veterinarian to prefer the mode of\r\nsecuring his patient in the supine position, both in his own behalf and\r\nthat of his employer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.\r\n\r\n1.

A knowledge of these is of course\r\nessential to a proper understanding of the description of the various\r\nmodes of operation, and of some of their sequelæ, upon which we shall\r\nsoon enter.\r\n\r\nThe testicular envelopes, passing from the surface inwards, are\r\nrepresented by the scrotum, the dartos, the cellular coat, the tunica\r\nerythroida, formed by the cremaster, and the fibrous and serous or\r\nvaginal sac (Fig. 2). The scrotum is a continuation of the skin, and\r\nforms a complete bag, common to both testicles, which it contains and\r\ncovers; the skin being here thin, vascular and nervous, usually black in\r\ncolor, almost hairless, and soft and unctuous to the touch. It is\r\ndivided into two lateral halves by a raphæ or median line. It is very\r\nelastic, and easily yields to the efforts of distention, to which it is\r\nsubjected, and when stretched over the organs it contains, presents a\r\nshining aspect, due to the sebaceous secretion which covers it. It\r\neasily contracts to its shrunken condition, and may be closely drawn up\r\ninto the inguinal canal, when it assumes a thickly wrinkled surface.\r\n\r\nThe second envelope, the dartos, is a prolongation of the tunica\r\nabdominalis, and is a yellow, fibrous structure, forming two distinct\r\nsacs resting upon each other, and lying on the inside of the scrotum, to\r\nwhich it is intimately adherent.\r\n\r\nIn the lateral and superior parts the adhesions are looser, and in front\r\nit becomes continuous with the suspensory ligament of the sheath, which,\r\nlike itself, forms a portion of the abdominal tunic. Under the dartos is\r\na layer of very loose cellular tissue, the lamellæ of which are so\r\nformed that it may be divided into several superimposed layers. This\r\nformation endows the testicle with great mobility in the dartoid sac;\r\nand these layers may be easily separated with the finger from the\r\nexternal surface of the fibrous coat beneath, except posteriorly, where\r\nit forms a strong band which sometimes requires even the aid of an\r\ninstrument to divide.\r\n\r\nThe next envelope is represented by the tunica erythroida which is the\r\ncremaster muscle, and from the lumbar region extends itself downwards\r\ninto the inguinal canal along the outside of the cord, and terminates\r\ntowards the superior part of the testicle in fibres spreading only over\r\nits external face. This muscle, by its deep surface, rests upon the\r\nfibrous coat--another envelope of the testicle and of the cord--and to\r\nwhich it is closely adherent. To the powerful contraction of this muscle\r\nis due the retraction of the testicle into the depth of the groin,\r\nwhich condition sometimes it is so difficult to overcome in the first\r\nstages of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous testicular envelope which we have just seen giving\r\nattachment to the cremaster, is a thin membranous bag, elongated like\r\nthe neck of a bottle around the spermatic cord, which it envelopes, and\r\ndilated below, in order to enclose the testicle. Lined internally by the\r\nserous coat, to which it intimately adheres, this last membrane is a\r\nduplicature of the peritoneum, drawn downwards by the testicle when it\r\ndescends from the abdominal cavity into the inguinal canal. This serous\r\nenvelope has, therefore, two coats, one lying on the inside of the\r\nfibrous tunic, and called the parietal, and that which covers the cord\r\nand the testicle and is known as the visceral. These two layers\r\napproximate towards the posterior border of the cord, and, as they\r\nunite, form a sort of fold, band, or septum which divides into two parts\r\nthe posterior portion of the vaginal cavity, and becomes a means of\r\nsolid adhesion between the tail of the epididymis and the bottom of the\r\nsac.\r\n\r\nThe testicles, thus covered by the visceral layer of the serous coat,\r\nare suspended at the end of the spermatic cord, and surmounted upon\r\ntheir superior border by the epididymis, the first part of the deferent\r\ncanal, which is folded upon itself, while at its posterior\r\nextremity--the “tail,” so called--it continues in a straight course, and\r\nconveys the product of the secretion of the testicles into the vesiculæ\r\nseminales, lodged in the pelvic cavity.\r\n\r\nThe spermatic cord is formed anteriorly by the spermatic or great\r\ntesticular artery, which forms, in that portion, a large number of\r\nflexuosities, causing its length greatly to exceed that of the cord to\r\nwhich it belongs. It contains a network of veins, and lymphatic vessels\r\nin abundance, which are united to the curves of the artery by a somewhat\r\nloose cellular tissue. A large number of nervous branches, given off by\r\nthe solar plexus, surrounds the whole.\r\n\r\nBetween the lamellæ of peritoneal structure which forms the posterior\r\nseptum, and which unites the parietal with the visceral layer, there is\r\nfound a band of grey muscular fibres--first discovered, I believe, by H.\r\nBouley--which exerts a powerful agency in the retraction of the testicle\r\ntowards the inguinal ring. Behind this muscle, and situated on the\r\ninternal face of the septum, are found the deferent canal and the\r\ncircumvolutions of the small testicular artery.\r\n\r\nHaving thus considered the essential points of the anatomical structure\r\nof these organs, we shall next seek to enforce the importance of their\r\ncareful study in reference to the intelligent and skilful performance of\r\nthe important operation which we are discussing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  CLASSIFICATION OF THE METHODS -- THREE CLASSES -- FIRST, IMMEDIATE\r\n  AMPUTATION -- SECOND, AMPUTATION AFTER APPLICATION OF HEMOSTATIC MEANS\r\n  UPON THE CORD -- THIRD, WITHOUT AMPUTATION, BUT DESTRUCTION OF\r\n  SECRETING POWER OF THE ORGAN -- SIMPLE EXCISION -- SCRAPING -- TEARING\r\n  AND TORSION -- TORSION -- FREE AND LIMITED -- ABOVE OR BELOW THE\r\n  EPIDIDYMIS -- LINEAR CRUSHING -- FIRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods of performing the operation of castration may be variously\r\nclassified, though in each class a varying number of modes will come\r\nunder our notice.\r\n\r\nThe first class will include the operations by which, the envelopes\r\nhaving been cut through, the vaginal sac opened and the testicle\r\nexposed, the organ is separated by an immediate section of the cord. A\r\nnumber of different processes are included under this head, among which\r\nare those of _scraping_, of _tearing_, of _torsion_, of _linear\r\ncrushing_, or by the _ecraseur_, and of _firing_, or the actual\r\ncautery.\r\n\r\nThe second class has also for its first or preliminary step, that of the\r\nfirst, viz., the incision of the bags, the opening of the vaginal sac,\r\nand the exposure of the testicle. But instead of removing the organ by\r\nthe division of the cord, we proceed as a second step, to the\r\napplication of an apparatus designed to operate by producing compression\r\nalong the length of the cord, and in this are included but two modes of\r\noperating, that by the _ligature_ and that by the _clamps_.\r\n\r\nThe third class, according to our category, presents to our view two\r\nfurther operations, both of which are essentially bloodless and dispense\r\nwith the incision of the bags, consisting of certain peculiar\r\nmanipulations which insure the destruction of the testicular structure,\r\nand consequently of its secreting power. They comprehend the process of\r\nthe _crushing of the spermatic cord_, and that of _subcutaneous double\r\ntwisting_--the _bistournage_ of the French.\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon the consideration of each of the separate modes we\r\nhave thus enumerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE EXCISION.\r\n\r\nThis is claimed to be one of the oldest modes of operating, and though\r\nto a great extent discarded by practitioners of the present day, still\r\nfinds its application in the treatment of the smaller animals. With\r\nlarger patients, however, though still strongly recommended by some\r\npractitioners, it is not generally employed on account of the profuse\r\nhemorrhage which necessarily follows the amputation of the cord. Still\r\nit is conceded that this hemorrhage, as in many cases of the clean,\r\ntransverse section of arterial blood vessels, will cease spontaneously\r\nby the contraction of the vessels on themselves, and the formation of a\r\nclot at the divided end, as well as in the surrounding cellular tissue.\r\nHowever, there is a possibility of the continuance of the hemorrhage for\r\nsome length of time, and the bad effects of excessive depletion are not\r\nto be overlooked, especially in an animal whose general constitution has\r\nfrom any cause suffered impairment. If there is any one of the various\r\nmodes of operating in which the standing position is allowable, this, in\r\nour opinion, is the one, the steps of the process being so few and so\r\nshort, and admitting such simplicity and rapidity. These consist in\r\nmaking a free opening in the bag, reaching with a single stroke of the\r\nknife into the vaginal cavity; grasping the testicle and pulling it\r\ngently downwards; and cutting the cord right across, from the front\r\nbackwards, above the epididymis, the cord returning of itself into the\r\nvaginal sac--the division being made, of course, on both sides. The\r\nanimal is then kept quiet in his stall and left alone until the\r\nhemorrhage subsides.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAPING.\r\n\r\nThis operation, which is said to have originated in India, is but a\r\nmodification of the preceding. Instead, however, of using a sharp edged\r\ninstrument to divide the cord, the surgeon, on the contrary, employs a\r\ndull knife, with which the coats of the artery and portions of the cord\r\nare scraped until the separation takes place. They are thus placed in\r\ngood condition for their temporary closure. This method is probably\r\nattended with a diminished amount of hemorrhage, and if carefully\r\nperformed, it may be entirely absent, the clot closing the artery, and\r\nthe condition of the lacerated threads of the vessel acting favorably,\r\nas well, in preventing it. The manipulations are similar to those\r\naccompanying the simple excision, though it is better and more safely\r\neffected when the animal is on his back. The testicles being exposed by\r\nthe incision through the envelopes, the posterior septum of the cord is\r\ncut through by a transverse section, and the scraping of the anterior\r\nfasciculus of the cord then performed, by a slow movement from above\r\ndownwards, along a certain extent, in order to effect a solution of\r\ncontinuity by a sort of wearing through the tissues. This operation is\r\nslow and requires a careful hand for its execution. But as it may in\r\nsome cases be followed by severe hemorrhage, it cannot, for that reason,\r\nbe recommended for large animals, for solipeds especially.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEARING AND TORSION.\r\n\r\nThese two modes of operation may, to a great extent, be considered as\r\nidentical. Indeed, the mode of torsion may be said to have arisen\r\nprincipally as a modification of that of tearing, which is the older. In\r\ntearing, the cord was subjected to a certain amount of torsion _by the\r\nhand_, and then torn apart at a given point in its length; while in the\r\nprocess of simple torsion, as properly performed, we obtain a division\r\nof the cord by twisting it _with instruments_, which enables the\r\noperator to effect the separation at a definitely determined spot.\r\nTearing differs, then, from torsion only in the fact that after giving\r\nseveral twists to the cord in order to gather its fibres into a more\r\ncompact mass, and to diminish the resistance of the more superficial\r\nlayers, it is divided in its continuity by a violent traction upon its\r\nfibres in the direction of its length.\r\n\r\nIn this process, especially applied to ruminants, the testicle being\r\nexposed, the operator secures the cord firmly with the thumb and index\r\nfinger of one hand, to prevent the traction from taking effect too far\r\nupwards when being made by the other hand, after the cord has been\r\ntwisted a few times on itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORSION.\r\n\r\nIn this method of castration the cord is twisted with sufficient force\r\nto cause it to break of itself at the point of the greatest violence.\r\nIts design is to accomplish the removal of the testicle without dragging\r\nor excessive traction upon the cord, and thus to avoid the hemorrhage\r\nfollowing the torsion of the spermatic artery, as a mode of hemostasis\r\nsufficient to prevent the flow of blood attendant upon the rupture of\r\nthe cord. The operation may be performed either above or below the\r\nepididymis, or may consist simply in the torsion of the artery alone. At\r\nfirst the hands only were called upon to act in the manipulations, and\r\nthe operation was from this cause known as _free torsion_, until about\r\nfifty years ago, when instruments were introduced into general practice,\r\nand gave rise to the plan of _limited torsion_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE TORSION.\r\n\r\n_Free torsion_, or that in which the hands alone are employed in the\r\noperation, may be performed, as before stated, either above or below the\r\nepididymis.\r\n\r\n_Above the Epididymis._--The first is one of the oldest modes of\r\ncastration known; one which must have been practiced contemporaneously\r\nwith the use of clamps, or in the first age of surgery. The first steps\r\nof the operation required for the exposure of the testicles are the same\r\nas have already been detailed. When this is accomplished the steps of\r\ntorsion and rupture are then performed in the following manner: The\r\noperator, grasping the testicle, carefully draws out the spermatic cord,\r\nand with a pointed bistoury makes a transverse incision, above the tail\r\nof the epididymis, through the posterior septum of the cord, involving\r\nwhat we know as the white muscle of Bouley, the efferent canal, and the\r\nsmall testicular artery. He then seizes the anterior fasciculus of the\r\ncord between the thumb and index finger of the left hand, squeezing it\r\nas tightly as possible, and having with the other hand secured the cord\r\nat a short distance below the point where the left hand has already been\r\nplaced, performs the torsion by a rotatory movement given to the\r\ntesticle itself, the motion having for its result the twisting and\r\ntearing of the cord when long enough continued to overcome the tenacity\r\nof its fibres. Fifteen or twenty turns of the organ will usually be\r\nfound sufficient to effect the rupture. A considerable degree of\r\nstrength in the fingers is required in this movement, and for this\r\nreason the torsion may take effect further up than may be desired, and\r\nbeyond the point designed, which may result in an unnecessary amount of\r\nirritation and injury. When the torsion has gone so far that the rupture\r\nof the cord has been effected, the stump is released, and retracts in\r\nthe inguinal canal to a certain height limited by the presence of the\r\nposterior septum, which holds it in place, and to a great extent\r\nprevents its return through the superior orifice of the inguinal canal.\r\n\r\n_Below the Epididymis._--This, the fourth step of the operation,\r\nconsists in the separation of the testicle from the epididymis and the\r\ntorsion of one upon the other. The testicle being exposed, the operator,\r\ntaking hold of its appendix, the epididymis, with the left hand, and of\r\nthe gland with the right, their cellular serous attachment is divided by\r\nthe thumbs from the posterior to the anterior extremity, from the tail\r\nto the head of the twisted efferent canal. If this cannot be done with\r\nthe hand, the convex bistoury must be called into action. This\r\naccomplished, the head of the epididymis is firmly secured with the\r\nfingers of the left hand, and the right hand, left free, gives to the\r\ntesticle the number of rotatory motions necessary to separate it from\r\nits excretory canal--that is, from eight to ten. When the testicle is\r\nthus severed, the stump of the end, with the epididymis, is pushed back\r\ninto the vaginal sac, where it is confined by the application of a\r\nsuture upon the middle of the edge of the scrotal wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITED TORSION.\r\n\r\n_Limited Torsion Above the Epididymis._--As we have seen, this is the\r\noperation by which the division of the spermatic cord is effected by\r\ntorsion made upon a given point in its length, and limited by the use of\r\nspecial instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.\r\n\r\nFIXING FORCEPS FOR TORSION.\r\n\r\n  A.--Renault and Delafond pattern.\r\n  B.--Perier.\r\n  C.--Reynal.]\r\n\r\nWe have already called attention to the difficulty of the operation of\r\nfree torsion, which requires a great deal of strength, and which,\r\nbesides, may be accompanied by a serious inflammatory condition of the\r\nparts, through rough manipulations of the cord. It is for this reason\r\nthat this mode of procedure must have been reserved for small animals,\r\nas, if performed upon the larger kinds, it can only be by men whose\r\nmuscular force is sufficient to enable them to overcome and bring into\r\nsubjection the struggling subjects of their operations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.\r\n\r\nMOVING FORCEPS FOR CASTRATION BY TORSION.\r\n\r\nRenault and Delafond pattern. Reynal pattern.]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1883 that two French veterinarians, Renault and Delafond, of\r\nthe Alfort school, introduced the use of instruments in the operation,\r\nas an improvement upon the manual methods and their effects on the\r\nsequelæ, though it is said to have been already practiced in Germany as\r\nfar back as the last century. The instruments employed are two forceps\r\nof peculiar construction, and which were more or less modified, one of\r\nwhich (_fixing_ forceps, Fig. 3,) is to be applied upon a fixed point of\r\nthe cord, where it is suffered to remain, and the other (_moving_\r\nforceps, Fig. 4,) is employed to accomplish the rotation of the testicle\r\nand the lower end of the cord. Those of Renault and Delafond or of\r\nReynal are now in general use. Those of Beaufils (Fig. 5) are, we\r\nbelieve, too complicated for general use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\n\r\nCOMBINED FORCEPS OF M. BEAUFILS.]\r\n\r\n_Modus Operandi._--In the first step of the operation, the ordinary\r\nmanipulations of the division of the envelopes, the opening of the sac\r\nand exposure of the testicle being accomplished, and the envelopes being\r\ncarefully pushed upwards, the torsion and excision of the cord are\r\neffected in the following manner: The entire cord is embraced by the\r\nfixing forceps (see Fig. 6), or only its anterior fasciculus if the\r\nposterior septum has been cut, as in the process by free torsion above\r\nthe epididymis. An assistant, seizing it from before backwards between\r\nits open branches and strongly closing them, holds it firmly, without\r\npulling upon the cord. The operator then grasps the cord with the moving\r\nforceps above the testicle, and a little below the point held by the\r\nassistant, leaving a small space between the instruments, and closing\r\nhis own tightly, begins the movement of torsion, which he directs from\r\nleft to right. For this he sometimes requires both hands, one of them\r\nkeeping the instrument in place, while the other continues the\r\nrotation as described. Ten or fifteen turns of the forceps are usually\r\nsufficient to complete the rupture of the cord, the artery, owing to its\r\nfacility of elongation, being the last part to give way. The testicle\r\nthen separates, being held in the branches of the moving forceps; the\r\nfixing forceps are removed, and the cord is drawn upwards into the\r\nvaginal sac. It is important in this operation to caution the assistant\r\nagainst drawing on the cord during the struggles of the animal,\r\nconsequent upon the pain caused by the first application of the\r\ninstruments, and the pressure upon the parts when held between their\r\ninflexible iron jaws; but on the contrary, to maintain it as closely as\r\npossible against the inguinal region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.\r\n\r\nOPERATION OF LIMITED TORSION.]\r\n\r\nThis process of castration is one of the most rapid of all the forms of\r\noperating. The only hemorrhage likely to occur is merely that of the\r\nsmall testicular artery, if it should happen to be divided when the\r\ntorsion is confined to the front portion of the cord.\r\n\r\n_Below the Epididymis._--This process differs from the preceding only in\r\nthe fact that instead of holding the cord between the fingers, it is\r\nheld by the fixed forceps, the use of the moving instrument being\r\nrendered unnecessary by the slightness of the adhesion of the seminal\r\ngland to its appendix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS KINDS OF ECRASEURS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLINEAR CRUSHING.\r\n\r\nThe originator of the use of that peculiar instrument, the ecraseur\r\n(Fig. 7), so valuable an adjunct in the operation of castration, is Mr.\r\nH. Bouley, who brought it into use at a date as early as the year 1857.\r\nIt is not, therefore, an American invention, as has sometimes been\r\nclaimed. The function of this instrument is to effect the division of\r\nliving parts without hemorrhage. The original ecraseur of Chassaignac\r\nhas received many modifications, all of which, however, operate upon the\r\nsame principle The essential design of all is to produce a general\r\nconstriction of the blood vessels, by which their internal and middle\r\ncoats being first divided, may contract within the cavity of the vessel\r\nin such a manner as to close their cavity and form a sort of stopper to\r\nthe artery, while the external cellular covering, the last to undergo\r\ndivision, is so stretched, under the action of the instrument, and so\r\nclosely adapts itself by its ends, that insufflation through the free\r\nends of the vessels fails to remove the closing arrangement of the two\r\ncoats first divided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.\r\n\r\nHOUSE CLAMPS.]\r\n\r\n_Modus Operandi._--The operation is comparatively a very simple one. The\r\ntesticle being exposed, as in all the other methods, the chain of the\r\ninstrument is so placed around the cord that the pressure takes place\r\nupon the greater mass of tissue, in order that it may continue the\r\nlonger; which being done, the lever of the instrument is brought into\r\naction, and the constriction caused by the chain slowly kept up until\r\nthe definite division of the tissue is accomplished. The essential\r\ncondition of success in the operation, having in view the desired\r\nhemostatic effect, is to _act slowly_. According to Prof. Bouley, an\r\ninterval of several seconds should be suffered to elapse after each\r\nrotation of the wheel which moves the chain. If the tissues are divided\r\ntoo rapidly, the section of the artery is apt to be too clean, and a\r\nhemorrhage is likely to be the result. This objection, however, though\r\nmade by one of the highest authorities in veterinary surgery, does not\r\nseem to be justified by the results obtained by American operators, most\r\nof whom both recommend and practice its execution as rapidly as\r\npossible; and according to their own statements, a serious hemorrhage is\r\nseldom encountered. The fact that it has been observed in any case,\r\nhowever, confirms the wisdom of the recommendation of Prof. Bouley, and\r\nas most of our American _confrères_ prefer the operation with the animal\r\nin the standing posture, the reason of their neglect of the prudent and\r\nmore truly surgical process can be readily appreciated. To avoid the\r\nhemorrhage Dr. House invented a clamp which he applied upon the cord\r\nprevious to the amputation with the ecraseur (Fig. 8). This mode of\r\ncastration is not very extensively practiced by European practitioners.\r\nThe reason of this is probably to be looked for in the essential\r\nnecessity of safety which so protracts its performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRING.\r\n\r\nThis mode of castration consists in the application to the cut end of\r\nthe testicular cord--previously divided with the bistoury, or by the\r\ncautery--as a means of hemostasis, of an iron heated to a white\r\nheat--the actual cautery. This is claimed to be one of the oldest modes\r\nof operating, Vegetius and Absyrtus describing it as a common process\r\nof castration. It is much in favor in England, and in some parts of\r\nGermany, though less practiced in some other parts of Europe. The\r\ninstruments essentially needed for the operation of castration by firing\r\nare two; the first, a peculiar forceps for holding the cord and securing\r\nit while the application of the cautery is being made; and the second,\r\nthe iron or cautery itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.\r\n\r\nSINGLE FORCEPS FOR CASTRATION BY FIRING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE FORCEPS FOR CASTRATION BY FIRING.]\r\n\r\nThese forceps, or nippers, are either single or double (Fig. 9), and may\r\nbe made either of wood or of iron, and more or less modified in form,\r\naccording to the fancies of the different operators. But they all work\r\non the same principle, and effect the same object. With the single\r\nforceps but one cord can be treated at a time, but with the double\r\ninstrument both cords may be secured at once, and may be divided and\r\ncauterized at one step. In this way the possibility of disturbing the\r\neschar caused by the cauterization of one cord while manipulating the\r\nsecond, is quite obviated.\r\n\r\nWhen the testicles, either or both, have been exposed, the mass of the\r\ncord is fixed between the jaws of the forceps, from before backwards, at\r\nabout one inch above the tail of the epididymis, and firmly secured.\r\nThis may be effected either by tying it tightly with a string wound\r\nabout the handles, or by means of a spring crank with which some\r\ninstruments are furnished. The testicle is then amputated, either by a\r\nstroke of the bistoury, or with the sharp edge of the cautery carried\r\nacross and at a right angle with the direction of the cord. This done,\r\nthe operator applies the broad portion of the iron over the entire\r\nsurface of the stump of the spermatic cord, and cauterizes (or sears)\r\nthe part thoroughly. It must be remembered that to insure the safety of\r\nthe cauterization, the iron must be very hot. Otherwise, when it is\r\nremoved, if it has cooled off, it may adhere to the carbonized surface,\r\nand the scab formed at the end of the blood vessel may accompany the\r\ninstrument. The application of pulverized rosin to the end of the cord,\r\nprevious to the cauterization, is recommended by some practitioners.\r\n\r\nA very proper precaution, and one on no account to be omitted, is the\r\nprotection of the surrounding parts from the radiating heat by covering\r\nthem with wet cloths.\r\n\r\nWhen the operation is completed, the forceps should be opened with great\r\ncare, in order to ascertain whether all hemorrhage has ceased, and the\r\ncord may be allowed to retract. If any oozing of blood appears at the\r\npoint of the operation, the cauterization must be repeated at the point\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nA free application of cold water, in the form of a _douche_, after the\r\noperation, will contribute to the formation of a clot in the cauterized\r\nartery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  METHODS OF THE SECOND CLASS -- CLAMPS -- COVERED AND UNCOVERED\r\n  OPERATION -- INSTRUMENTS -- FOUR VARIOUS STEPS -- OBJECTION TO THIS\r\n  METHOD -- TIME TO REMOVE THE CLAMPS -- LIGATURE -- OF THE CORD AND ITS\r\n  ENVELOPES -- OF THE CORD ONLY -- OF THE SPERMATIC ARTERY -- OF THE\r\n  EFFERENT CANAL -- SUBCUTANEOUS OPERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving completed the consideration of the various methods included in\r\nthe first class, we propose next to examine those entering into the\r\nsecond, which embrace those in which certain means of pressure are\r\napplied and suffered to remain upon the cord previous to the amputation\r\nof the testicle. These are two in number, and consist of the process\r\nknown as that of the clamps, and that which involves the use of the\r\nligature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD BY THE CLAMPS.\r\n\r\nThis is an ancient mode of operating, having been transmitted to us\r\nthrough many ages. It has received the sanction of long practice, and,\r\nif not absolutely superior to all others, is possessed of qualities and\r\nadvantages which all who have employed it will freely acknowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is performed in two ways. One is the process of the _covered_, the\r\nother of the _uncovered_ testicle. The covered operation is that in\r\nwhich only a portion of the testicular envelopes are divided, the\r\nscrotum and the dartos, the gland being left covered with the other\r\nenvelopes. On the other hand, in the uncovered operation, all the\r\nenveloping membranes are divided, and the testicle is made to protrude\r\noutside of the vaginal sac. The first three steps of this mode of\r\noperating are understood to have been performed in the methods which we\r\nhave already considered as generally preliminary in all cases, in order\r\nto obtain access to the cord.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.\r\n\r\nORDINARY CLAMP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERNAL FACE OF CLAMPS.]\r\n\r\nThe instruments necessary to operate in this case are a very sharp\r\nconvex bistoury, a pair of clamps, some strong twine, a castrating\r\nforceps and a pair of scissors. The clamps are wooden or metallic\r\npincers, formed to embrace the cord and to be applied firmly upon it, in\r\norder to hold it securely, and to confine the artery tightly enough to\r\nprevent the occurrence of hemorrhage. The form most ordinarily used, and\r\nprobably most convenient, is made of wood, and consists of two\r\nsemi-cylindrical pieces (Fig. 10) joined at one end and resting together\r\nby a flat and sometimes grooved surface, and measuring about six inches\r\nin length. The material is a light but strong wood. They are rounded at\r\nthe extremities, in order to avoid chafing the soft tissues. A groove at\r\neach end is designed to receive the twine, which is part of the\r\nappliance. Before being used they are tightly tied together at one end,\r\nin such a manner that they spring open if closed. This point is one of\r\nthe first importance. It requires considerable exercise of strength to\r\nplace them tightly enough on the cord they are to hold, but this firm\r\njuxtaposition, so obtained, facilitates their removal, when that is\r\nrequired. The groove which they carry on their flat surface is sometimes\r\nfilled with some merely lubricating greasy substance, usually simple\r\nointment, fresh lard, butter, or cream, though some veterinarians use a\r\ncaustic paste. This last mode of proceeding is strongly opposed by some\r\nauthorities, as likely to induce unnecessary inflammatory action,\r\nthrough the formation of a scab, which may require for its removal a\r\nprocess of sloughing, which may in some cases give rise to serious\r\ncomplications. As I have stated, the clamps are not always made of wood,\r\nand very many alterations and improvements, so called, have been from\r\ntime to time brought forward. In Fig. 11 a few of these clamps are\r\npresented. The oldest form is the simplest, and possesses the further\r\nadvantage of being always easy to be obtained, while the more\r\ncomplicated contrivances are not always easy of access.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS SHAPES OF CLAMPS.\r\n\r\nScrewed Clamp. Spring Clamp of Brandt. Hinge Clamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.\r\n\r\nFORCEPS TO HOLD THE CLAMP TOGETHER. VISE FOR THE SAME.]\r\n\r\nThe castrating forceps (Fig. 12) are used for bringing the clamps\r\ntogether while they hold the spermatic cord between their branches.\r\nThere are several kinds of these, but in default of obtaining them\r\nreadily, the operator may find an eligible substitute in the\r\nblacksmith’s nippers or the gasfitter’s tongs. We have used this latter\r\nfor a good many years, and have found it very well adapted to the\r\npurpose required, by the presence of its set of double curved and\r\ngrooved jaws. The twine which it is necessary to use to keep the clamps\r\nclosed when they have been brought into perfect contact with the\r\ncastrating forceps, must be soft and strong. A piece of fishing line,\r\npreviously waxed, will answer the purpose very well. In order to\r\nfacilitate the traction which may be necessary to keep the clamps in\r\nplace, it is a good precaution to attach the ends of the twine to small\r\nwooden handles to protect the hands from cutting by the string. It is\r\nwell, also, to prepare a reserve of clamps and twine against accidents\r\nfrom breakage or the mislaying of these articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVERED OPERATION.\r\n\r\n_Modus Operandi._--The animal being thrown on either side, as already\r\ndescribed, and kept as nearly as possible on his back by bundles of\r\nstraw packed under him on the lower side, and the right hind leg secured\r\nin its proper position, and the instruments placed within easy reach,\r\nthe surgeon proceeds with the fourfold steps of the operation,\r\nconsisting first, in the prehension of the left testicle, or lowest in\r\nposition; second, the incision through the envelopes; third, the\r\nenucleation of the testicle; and fourth, the application and\r\nconstriction of the clamps.\r\n\r\n_First step._--The operation must always begin with the prehension of\r\nthe gland which corresponds with the side--the lower--upon which the\r\nanimal is lying. This obviates any danger of interference by any little\r\nhemorrhage which might occur, and so facilitates the application of the\r\nclamps. Then, placing himself toward the back of the patient, the\r\noperator reaches over and grasps the lower testicle with both hands,\r\nbringing it downwards in such a manner as to stretch the scrotum over\r\nits surface. This manipulation is not always of easy performance, the\r\ncontraction of the cremaster muscle being sometimes so powerful that the\r\ngland successfully resists all the operator’s efforts of traction. It is\r\nsometimes necessary to divert the attention of the animal, in order to\r\nfacilitate this part of the process, by pricking him with a pin on the\r\nlips or about the anus, the effect of the new sensation being such that\r\nhis opposition is withdrawn, and the contraction ceasing, he suffers\r\npassively the traction of the envelopes over the organ. Or, the same\r\nadvantage may be obtained by the inhalation of a little ether or\r\nchloroform. Then grasping the cord with the left hand and bringing the\r\norgan well forward, the surgeon proceeds to the\r\n\r\n_Second step_, or that of the incision of the envelope. Holding the\r\nsharp convex bistoury in his right hand, he takes, with the thumb, a\r\n_point d’appui_ upon the prominent organ, and carries it carefully over\r\nthe surface of the scrotum in a direction parallel with the median raphè\r\n(described in the first chapter), and following the great curvature of\r\nthe testicle, and being careful with the first movement of the\r\ninstrument to divide only the scrotal skin and the dartos, until the\r\nmost superficial layers of the cellular tissue of the third testicular\r\nenvelope are reached. The skin and the dartos being divided, the edges\r\nof the wound separate, and the testicle, still pressed downwards and\r\noutwards with the left hand, protrudes more or less, still included, as\r\nit is, within its fibrous covering. A careful dissection, with a few\r\nlight strokes of the bistoury, or laceration with the thumb nail of the\r\nhand, now suffices for the separation of the fibrous envelope from its\r\nexternal covering, an entire separation of both of which can thus be\r\neasily obtained by pressing the most external layer upwards through the\r\nlaceration of the cellular coat which unites them.\r\n\r\n_Third step._--The operator now relieves himself of his instrument--not,\r\nwe may venture to suggest, by placing it between his teeth, as some\r\ncareless surgeons are apt to do, but by handing it to an assistant--and,\r\nchanging his position, places himself in front of the inguinal region,\r\nand facing it. He then proceeds to the enucleation of the testicle, by\r\nseparating the adhesion which exists between the internal face of the\r\ndartos and the external surface of the cremaster muscle and of the\r\nfibrous tunic. The separation being completed, and the scrotum and\r\ndartos being carefully pushed upwards, the patient is now ready for the\r\nlast step of the operation.\r\n\r\n_Fourth step._--The testicle, well enucleated from its superficial\r\nenvelopes, but still covered by the fibrous coat, and the vaginal sac\r\nstill remaining intact, the operator, facing, as before, the inguinal\r\nregion, proceeds to the application of the clamps. The cutaneous\r\ncovering and the dartos being pushed well upwards, the clamp is placed\r\nupon the cord above the epididymis, from before backwards, the\r\nassistant, armed with the castrating forceps, taking both of its\r\nbranches between the jaws of that instrument, carefully bringing them\r\ntogether, and closing them as tightly as possible. The instant of the\r\npressure of the clamp upon the cord is marked by very severe pain, and\r\nthe suffering animal is excited to powerful struggling. It is important\r\nthat the assistant should be aware of this, and he should be forewarned\r\nto refrain from pulling on the cord, and reminded, in order to avoid\r\ninjury from this accident, to keep the clamps and the forceps steadily\r\nin contact with the inguinal canal. It is probably with a view to the\r\navoidance of this possible injury that the use of a peculiarly\r\nconstructed vise or forceps has been recommended. The forceps being in\r\nplace, and tightly confining the branches of the clamps, well adjusted,\r\nthe operator now applies the twine, and after taking several turns\r\naround the grooves of the free ends of the clamps, secures it carefully\r\nwith a double knot.\r\n\r\nThe operation is then repeated on the right or uppermost testicle in the\r\nsame manner, and with the same precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCOVERED OPERATION.\r\n\r\nThe four steps of this operation are the same as those of the previous\r\nmethod, the first requiring the same manipulations and observing the\r\nsame order, but the second involving some variations. In this the same\r\ncareful dissection is dispensed with, and one free incision suffices,\r\nincluding all the various envelopes, in order to expose the testicle\r\nfreely and at once. The incision is made with one free stroke of the\r\nbistoury extending from the posterior to the anterior extremity of the\r\ntesticle, and dividing at once scrotum, dartos, and the fibrous and\r\nserous coats. Though this is to be done without hesitation, it is by no\r\nmeans necessary to adopt the practice of some operators, who not only\r\ndivide the envelopes, but even make a large incision in the testicular\r\nstructure itself, inflicting thus an unnecessary amount of pain from\r\nwhich the animal might, with a little care, have been spared.\r\n\r\nWhen the surgeon reaches the third step of the operation, and seizes the\r\ntesticle with the right hand, in order to draw it downward and outside\r\nof the vaginal sac, he may encounter great resistance to his traction,\r\nfrom the powerful opposition of the white muscular tissue running along\r\nthe posterior septum of the cord. He must then slowly and steadily draw\r\nthe testicle down, and at a given moment, with a single stroke with a\r\nsharp pointed bistoury, divide the serous band of the posterior septum,\r\ncutting at once the muscular fibres, the efferent canal and the small\r\ntesticular artery. This being effected, the resistance will terminate,\r\nand the testicle may be drawn down without further difficulty. The\r\ndivision of the septum is not always resorted to. Still, the verdict of\r\nexperience is strongly in favor of the measure. The application of the\r\nclamps (Fig. 13) is effected in the same manner as in the covered\r\noperation, but in this instance the clamp is placed higher on the cord.\r\nFor this reason the assistant must be especially careful during the\r\nstruggles of the patient when the clamps are tightened, the danger of\r\ninguinal hernia at this point being too serious to be overlooked. The\r\nclamps being in place, and properly secured, the testicles are either\r\nleft in place and allowed to slough away, or are amputated a short\r\ndistance below the clamps, as the case may be. The parts being carefully\r\nwashed out, the animal is allowed to rise, and is returned to his stall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.\r\n\r\nCASTRATION WITH UNCOVERED TESTICLE.]\r\n\r\nAn objection frequently urged against this mode of operation is that it\r\nrequires a second visit of the surgeon when the time has arrived for the\r\nremoval of the clamps. Estimating this objection at its proper value,\r\nwe consider that it is more than balanced by the advantages attendant\r\nupon this special mode of castration, and while we fully appreciate the\r\ndifficulty and inconvenience to which the surgeon may be subjected by\r\nthis second visit, we cannot approve of its omission, either from a\r\nsurgical point of view or in that of the interests of the employers, in\r\nwhose behalf all care and responsibility should be exercised, until the\r\npatient is at least enjoying a fair prospect of recovery.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, at what time can the clamp be removed with\r\nsafety? It must be understood that there may sometimes be peculiar\r\nsurgical conditions under which their removal is contra-indicated, and\r\nwhen they must be allowed to slough off without further interference on\r\nour part. But even in ordinary cases and under favorable circumstances,\r\nthis time appears to vary. By some they are removed after thirty-six\r\nhours, while others allow them to remain for a period of four or five\r\ndays. Taking a fair average, we are of opinion that it may be safely\r\ndone on about the third day, and that at that period the closing of the\r\nartery is sufficiently assured to remove all further pressure.\r\n\r\nIf the clamps have been secured with twine, and especially if they were\r\nproperly prepared previously to their application, the process of\r\nremoval is a very simple one. The assistant, raising one of the\r\npatient’s hind legs, the operator places himself directly behind the\r\nanimal, and bending down, with a sharp sage-knife, cuts the twine where\r\nit has secured the posterior ends of the clamp. If it retains the\r\nspringiness it ought to have possessed at the time of its original\r\napplication, the branches readily spring open, and it falls to the\r\nground. If this does not occur, or if they should be held by adhesions\r\nwith some dried parts of the cords which have been pressed between the\r\nbranches of the clamps, they must be carefully separated by moving from\r\nbelow upwards, when they will easily become detached. But this last\r\nmanipulation must be very carefully performed, if we would escape a\r\nhemorrhage which might require serious measures to control. When clamps\r\nof another make are used, the process of removal will vary according to\r\nexisting peculiarities in the construction of the instrument. The clamp\r\nhaving been removed from one side, the separation from the other will,\r\nof course, be managed in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIGATURE.\r\n\r\nThis method of castration consists in the application of a circular\r\nligature upon the entire cord, or a portion of it, for the purpose of\r\ncompletely closing it, with the various parts entering into its\r\nformation. It was in practice so long ago as 1734. The operation is\r\ndivided into several varieties, viz., that of the cord with its\r\nenvelopes; that of the cord only, either by the covered or uncovered\r\nmethod; that of the spermatic artery alone; that of the efferent canal;\r\nand that by the subcutaneous process.\r\n\r\nThe ligature used in these various modes of operation is formed of\r\nwaxed silk; sometimes of strong twine, as fishing line, for example; or,\r\nas more recently introduced in surgery in the removal of living growths\r\nand tumors, an elastic cord.\r\n\r\n_Ligation of the cord and its envelopes._--This process is principally\r\nused upon small animals, although, since the elastic cord has been\r\nbrought into use, a few attempts have been made to make it applicable to\r\nthe larger kinds. The experiments, however, have been as yet so few, and\r\nthe results so unsatisfactory, and in so many cases fatal, that it can\r\nscarcely be recommended, except for small subjects. The application of\r\nthis is very simple. It consists, after securing the patient, in\r\nbringing the testicles as far down into the scrotum as may be thought\r\nneedful, and after applying the ligature two or three times around the\r\ncord, a short distance above them (Fig. 14), slowly and steadily\r\ntightening it until a sufficient amount of force has been employed to\r\nclose the calibre of the blood vessel and cut off the circulation from\r\nthe parts situated below the point of ligation. This mode of operating\r\nhas, in our hands, proved very successful in small animals, and when the\r\nelastic ligature has been used. Mortification has taken place in a few\r\ndays, the testicles slowly detaching themselves at the point of\r\nligature, and when falling off leaving but a very small superficial,\r\ncutaneous scab, and healing in a short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.\r\n\r\nCASTRATION BY LIGATION OF THE CORD AND ENVELOPES.]\r\n\r\n_Ligature of the cord only; covered operation._--The first three steps\r\nof the operation having been accomplished, and the testicle enucleated,\r\nthe ligature is placed around the cord, still covered by its fibrous\r\nenvelopes and the cremaster muscle. A piece of twine or an elastic\r\nligature may be employed for this purpose. In this operation the\r\ntesticles are allowed to remain not less than twenty-four hours, before\r\namputation is performed, in order that if the pressure has been\r\ninsufficient, and the parts should fail to exhibit symptoms of loss of\r\nvitality after that time, another ligature may be applied.\r\n\r\n_Uncovered operation._--The only variation between this method and the\r\none last considered is found in the fact that in this, the testicle and\r\ncord being exposed as in the process of castration with the clamp, the\r\nligature is applied either on the cord as a whole, or only on its\r\nanterior fasciculus. In this case the testicle is amputated immediately\r\nafter the application of the ligature. But as there is a possibility of\r\nthe slipping off of the ligature, great care must be taken lest the\r\namputation be performed too near the point where the constriction is\r\nmade. And again, as there is a possibility of the truncated cord being\r\ndrawn too far up, even up into the abdominal cavity, it becomes a\r\nprecaution of prudence, as recommended by Mr. Bouley, to leave a\r\nsufficient length of the ligature hanging outside of the scrotal wound,\r\nand even to secure it on the edges of the skin.\r\n\r\n_Legation of the spermatic artery._--This is a mode of castration which,\r\nif we are not mistaken, was held in high estimation by certain\r\npractitioners in the city of Boston. It consists simply in the\r\napplication of a ligature of silk to the spermatic artery. The cord\r\nbeing exposed, and the posterior septum being divided, a curved needle\r\narmed with the ligature is made to pass around the whole mass of the\r\nanterior fasciculus, and the entire vascular cord is surrounded by the\r\nligature and firmly tightened. The fact of the various and irregular\r\nflexuosities peculiar to the spermatic artery, with both ascending and\r\ndescending portions, explains the necessity of including the entire\r\narterial mass under the ligature, since, if only the simple cord of the\r\nartery were ligated, it might be an ascending portion only, and the\r\namputation of the testicle might be followed by a troublesome hemorrhage\r\nfrom one of the descending loops.\r\n\r\n_Ligation of the efferent canal and the subcutaneous ligation of the\r\ncord._--These two modes of operating have not yet yielded sufficient\r\nevidence in the form of satisfactory results to be entitled to more than\r\npassing mention at the present time. We may say further, moreover, that\r\namong all the methods of castration by ligation, none of them have been\r\nsubjected to a sufficient amount of practical test to be accepted as a\r\nprocess which will justify a strong recommendation or unqualified\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  THIRD METHOD OF CASTRATION -- CRUSHING OF THE TESTICULAR CORD --\r\n  DOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION -- BISTOURNAGE -- FOUR STEPS OF THE\r\n  OPERATION -- SYMPTOMS FOLLOWING -- CASTRATION OF CRYPTORCHIDS --\r\n  INGUINAL CRYPTORCHIDY -- ABDOMINAL CRYPTORCHIDY -- MODUS OPERANDI --\r\n  FIVE STEPS IN THE OPERATION -- EFFECTS FOLLOWING THE OPERATION OF\r\n  CASTRATION -- MODE OF CICATRIZATION -- HYGIENIC AND SUBSEQUENT\r\n  ATTENTIONS OR AFTER CARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have before stated, the third method of castration embraces the\r\nprocesses in which the testicular envelopes are left intact, while it is\r\nthe gland or cord which is submitted to the peculiar manipulations by\r\nwhich their structure, and therefore the secreting powers of the\r\ntesticle, are so essentially modified. In treating of this method, two\r\nspecial operations present themselves for our consideration, to wit: the\r\n_crushing of the testicular support_, and the _double subcutaneous\r\ntwisting_, or _bistournage_ of the French. These are employed\r\nprincipally in the castration of ruminants, though efforts have been\r\nmade to apply the latter in the case of solipeds. The modes of operating\r\nwhich we have already described are, however, also applicable to the\r\nruminants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUSHING OF THE TESTICULAR CORD.\r\n\r\nThis consists in crushing the spermatic cord with a hammer, the vessel\r\ncontinuing, meanwhile, to be covered with its envelopes. It was first\r\ndescribed in the year 1826, and is most commonly practised in some\r\nFrench districts. The instruments used are two cylindrical pieces of\r\nwood, each about one yard in length and two inches in diameter; and a\r\nhammer or mallet formed of hard and heavy wood. The animal being\r\nproperly secured in the standing position, the testicles being drawn\r\nwell down into the bottom of the envelopes, the sticks are placed, one\r\nbehind and one in front of the cord, close to the upper extremity of the\r\ngland. When in that position they are moved in such a manner that\r\ninstead of remaining, one in front of the other, one becomes so\r\nsuperimposed upon the other that the spermatic cord becomes twisted in\r\nthe form of the letter S (Fig. 15). While held together in this position\r\nby an assistant, the operator, placing himself in front of one side of\r\nthe hind quarter, with repeated blows of the hammer or mallet, crushes\r\nthe cord at the point where it rests upon the wood which occupies the\r\ninferior position, of course guaging the force and frequency of the\r\nblows by the effect observed, until the crushing of the organ is\r\nsatisfactorily accomplished. As a measure of caution, it will be well,\r\nupon the completion of the process of crushing, to surround the cord\r\nwith a ligature moderately tightened, in order to guard against the\r\ndrawing up of the cord into the inguinal canal, an accident not likely\r\nto occur, however, if the operation has been well performed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.\r\n\r\nCASTRATION BY CRUSHING OF THE CORD.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION; BISTOURNAGE.\r\n\r\nIn this mode of operating, principally in vogue in the southern parts of\r\nFrance, the position of the testicle is so changed that its lower\r\nextremity is made to take the place of the upper, the cord is subjected\r\nto a certain degree of torsion, and then the testicle is restored to its\r\nnormal position, to undergo a process of atrophy which destroys its\r\npower of secretion by a physiological action. The great length of the\r\ncord and the greater laxity of the cellular tissue situated between the\r\ndartos and the fibrous coat, render this operation much easier in the\r\nruminants than in the solipeds. Simple in its manipulations, although\r\nstill involving a certain degree of dexterity, and followed by\r\ncomparatively no symptoms of reactive fever, the only instrument\r\nnecessary for its performance is a piece of cord, twine, or rubber,\r\nsufficiently strong to secure the testicular envelopes when the gland\r\nhas been subjected to the double displacement, and the cord to the\r\ntorsion it has undergone. In this operation, no special preparation\r\nbeing demanded, the animal is usually treated on his feet.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Serres, of the veterinary school of Toulouse, divides the\r\noperation into four steps, viz., _first_, the softening of the bags and\r\nseparation of the dartos from the fibrous tissue; _second_, the\r\ndisplacement (dislocation) of the testicle; _third_, the torsion of the\r\ncord; and _fourth_, the pushing up of the testicles into the inguinal\r\nregion, with the application of the ligature to keep them in place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16 (A).\r\n\r\nDOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.\r\n\r\nSoftening the bags--first position of the hands.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16 (B).\r\n\r\nDOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.\r\n\r\nSoftening of the bags--second position of the hands.]\r\n\r\nThe first step is the most difficult for the surgeon as well as the most\r\npainful to the horse, though the contrary is the fact where the subject\r\nis an ox. The operator, stationing himself behind the animal, grasps\r\nthe testicles with both hands (Fig. 16) and quickly draws them down into\r\nthe scrotum. Holding them there with the right hand, with the left he\r\nraises the scrotum by the lower part, firmly pulling upon it downwards\r\nand slightly from before backwards. The testicles are then moved upward\r\nand downward in the sac, carrying with them the fibrous covering. During\r\nthis time a peculiar crackling sound is heard, which is caused by the\r\ntearing apart of the fibres of the cellular tissue lying between the\r\ndartos and the fibrous coat. This laceration is sometimes difficult to\r\neffect, especially in aged animals, in which case the up and down motion\r\nof the testicles will require a greater number of repetitions before the\r\nadhesions are torn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.\r\n\r\nPosition of the left hand at the beginning of the second step.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.\r\n\r\nSecond step.]\r\n\r\nThe second step consists in the displacement or dislocation of the\r\ntesticle, which is accomplished in the manner following: The testicles\r\nbeing pushed well upwards in the vaginal sac, one of them, the left, for\r\nexample, is drawn well downwards with the left hand, which grasps the\r\ncord above the epididymis (Fig. 17), the thumb resting on the back of\r\nthe cord, and the remaining fingers in front of it, while the right\r\nhand, placed in pronation, pinches the inferior part of the scrotum.\r\nMaintaining these dispositions, the testicles are displaced by the\r\nsimultaneous action of both hands, the left pushing the cord from above\r\ndownwards and from before backwards, in such a manner as to depress as\r\nmuch as possible the superior extremity of the gland, while with the\r\nfingers of the right hand, resting by their dorsal face against the\r\nposterior part of the testicle (Fig. 18), the inferior extremity of that\r\norgan is pushed upwards. Without losing hold of the envelope, the\r\nmovement of this hand gives way to these opposite and simultaneous\r\npressures, that of the left hand tending to lower the head of the\r\ntesticle, and that of the right elevating its tail, and the gland is\r\nbeing flexed upon the cord from which it is suspended, backwards and\r\nupwards. At the moment when the testicle forms an acute angle with the\r\ncord, the thumb of the left hand, resting upon the cord, comes into\r\naction to aid in the displacement by making a _point d’appui_ upon the\r\ninferior extremity of the organ, which now occupies the superior\r\nposition, in such a manner that the spermatic gland is placed parallel\r\nwith the cord. The manipulations are completed by pushing the testicles\r\nupwards towards the inguinal ring, to break up whatever adhesions of\r\ncellular tissue may remain. This second step of the operation being\r\ncompleted, the two organs are found to be so placed that they are\r\nparallel one with the other, the testicle being posterior to the cord.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.\r\n\r\nThird step. Position of the hands when the torsion is about being made.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.\r\n\r\nThird step. Position of the hands during the torsion.]\r\n\r\nThe third step, or that of the torsion of the cord, now presents itself\r\nto our notice. To effect this, the testicle must be firmly held at the\r\nbottom of the envelopes (Fig. 19), the left hand placed forward upon the\r\ncord, and the right behind and upon the testicle. The operator then\r\ngives to the organ a twist with the right hand by a motion of rotation\r\nfrom left to right and from without inwards, while with the other he\r\ndraws upon the cord in the opposite direction. The result of this\r\nmanipulation is to give to the gland half a turn around the cord (Fig.\r\n20), which thus becomes displaced and takes a posterior position. By a\r\nchange in the action of the hands, but a repetition of the same\r\nmovement, the right hand now acting on the cord, while the left is\r\napplied to the testicle, the remaining portion of the motion of rotation\r\nis performed, and a complete torsion of the spermatic support\r\naccomplished. By repeating this action, of course as many turns of the\r\ncord as may be thought necessary, can be secured, two, however, being\r\ngenerally found sufficient, although, in a few instances as many as four\r\nor five may be required--never more than that. The length of the cord is\r\nthe principal controlling circumstance. When these several steps have\r\nbeen completed with one testicle, their repetition is, of course, in\r\norder with the other. And when both have been treated, the consummation\r\nof the operation is called for by entering upon the fourth step, or that\r\nof the application of the ligature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.\r\n\r\nPosition of the testicles and ligature en masse of the bags when the\r\noperation is finished.]\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this both testicles are firmly seized with both hands,\r\nand pressed upwards as far as possible against the inguinal ring (Fig.\r\n21). It is necessary to be very careful to ascertain that they rest on\r\nthe same level, in order to be secure against the possibility of\r\nuntwisting. The ligature is then applied by passing three or four turns\r\nof it around the scrotal envelopes, immediately below the testicles,\r\nwith not more than a sufficient degree of tightness to assure it against\r\nslipping off.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms which succeed the operation are not commonly of a very\r\nserious nature, and subside within a period of time varying from two to\r\nsix hours. Following the operation an inflammatory swelling takes place\r\nin the bags, and after one or two days assumes large dimensions. The\r\nligature can now be removed, and the animal left to himself, without\r\nfurther treatment, the testicles undergoing a slow process of atrophy\r\nreadily recognized by their appearance and the position they always\r\nthereafter occupy in the vaginal sac.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF CRIPTORCHIDS.\r\n\r\nThe abnormal development of animals in which the testicles have failed\r\nto make their appearance by descending through the inguinal canal into\r\nthe bags, is quite commonly met with in solipeds, the animal being then\r\nknown by the designation of ridglings or originals. The position assumed\r\nby the organ in relation to its normal situation being so altered that\r\nit may be found either partly engaged in the inguinal canal (Fig. 22),\r\nor only remaining close to its superior opening (Fig. 23), is one of\r\nthese inequalities, constituting what is called inguinal criptorchidy;\r\nanother being when it remains floating in or adherent to some parts of\r\nthe abdominal cavity--a condition known as abdominal criptorchidy (Fig.\r\n24). As this condition has usually a peculiar effect on the temper of\r\nthe animal so affected, often rendering him unfit for general use, it\r\nnecessitates, on that account, the act of castration, with some changes\r\nin the manipulations described for the operation upon animals exempt\r\nfrom such an infirmity. In these cases the operation presents more\r\ndifficulties, and is of a more serious character than the former,\r\ndemanding on the part of the operator all the skill and knowledge which\r\ncan be acquired from its frequent performance and extensive study. That\r\nthe operation is one which is largely performed on the Continent there\r\nis no doubt, and many European operators have made for themselves an\r\nextensive reputation in connection with it. Among these the name of\r\nProfessor Degives, of the Brussels school, merits mention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.\r\n\r\nTESTICLE ENGAGED IN THE INGUINAL RING.\r\n\r\nB--Testicle. C--Gubernaculum testis. D--Inguinal ring.]\r\n\r\nBut there is probably, on this Continent at least, no better accredited\r\nauthority, in this branch of surgery, than a gentleman, a layman, of\r\nIllinois, known very widely as FARMER MILES, who has for many years not\r\nonly sustained an eminent repute in his specialty as a gelder, but I\r\nbelieve, has devoted a large share of study specially to the castration\r\nof ridglings. He has not only traversed large portions of the\r\nUnited States in the practice of this interesting branch of veterinary\r\nsurgery, but has likewise achieved much renown and appreciative\r\ncriticism from foreign sources, having travelled extensively in various\r\nEuropean countries, and earned much honor from those who have watched\r\nhis methods, and received ocular proof of his dexterity and success\r\nwithin the sphere of his special field of usefulness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.\r\n\r\nTESTICLE CLOSE TO THE RING.\r\n\r\n  C′--Internal portion of the gubernaculum testis.\r\n  C--Its external portion.\r\n  B--Testicle.\r\n  D--Inguinal ring.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.\r\n\r\nTESTICLE FLOATING IN THE ABDOMEN.\r\n\r\n  A--Peritoneal ligament attached to the lumbar region.\r\n  B--Testicle.\r\n  C--Gubernaculum testis.\r\n  D--Inguinal ring.]\r\n\r\nThe method of procedure, which has in his hands proved so exceptionally\r\nsuccessful, though no doubt essentially original with him, is still, we\r\nbelieve, based upon the same principles which govern the operation as we\r\nfind it described and illustrated in the works of the classical writers\r\nwho have given their attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the consideration of the _modus operandi_, as observed in\r\nthe two forms of cryptorchidy, the inguinal and the abdominal.\r\n\r\n\r\nINGUINAL CRYPTORCHIDY.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary steps in this case are the same as those which are\r\nnecessary in the castration of animals under normal conditions. The\r\ninstruments required are a convex bistoury, one or two clamps, or a\r\nligature, and an actual cautery, or the ecraseur most commonly in use.\r\nTo these is sometimes added a pair of long forceps of peculiar\r\nconstruction, with jaws terminating in two spoon-shaped extremities,\r\ndesigned to grasp the testicle when placed high in the inguinal canal,\r\nor if only partly engaged in the ring. Prof. Degives divides the\r\noperation into five steps.\r\n\r\n_First; the incision of the scrotum and the dartos._--The operator, with\r\nor without the aid of an assistant, makes a straight longitudinal\r\nincision upon the scrotum at the place where the testicle is nominally\r\nsituated, carefully dividing, also, the yellow fibrous layer which\r\nrepresents the dartos, being especially careful at this point to avoid\r\nthe large venous branches which abound in the region involved. A sort of\r\nhooked bistoury is, we understand, preferred by some veterinarians for\r\nthis incision, on the score of the additional safety secured by the use\r\nof an instrument of that form.\r\n\r\n_Second step; exposure of the external inguinal ring._--To accomplish\r\nthis the loose cellular tissue which lies under the dartos is torn and\r\ndivided by the fingers until the ring is felt. The\r\n\r\n_Third step is the dissection of the vaginal sheath._--The sheath being\r\nsituated at varying depths, the dissection is effected by carefully\r\nintroducing the hand into the inguinal canal, and separating it as much\r\nas possible by passing the fingers around its external surface.\r\n\r\n_Fourth step; opening the sheath._--The opening is made lengthwise, and\r\nof sufficient width to allow of the passage of the testicle. When this\r\norgan is situated high up in the ring, it is frequently difficult to\r\ngrasp it and keep it sufficiently steady in position to permit the free\r\nuse of the bistoury. The sheath being opened and all the testicular\r\nenvelopes divided, we complete the operation by perfecting the\r\n\r\n_Fifth stage, or the removal of the testicle._--There are two ways of\r\naccomplishing this, viz.: the direct and the indirect division of the\r\ncord. In the former case the amputation is effected either by the\r\nprocess of cauterization, by limited torsion, or with the ecraseur. In\r\nthe latter the testicle is removed either by a ligature or by the\r\nprocess of the clamps. The process by the ecraseur is at once that which\r\nis most generally preferred and the easiest of application.\r\n\r\n\r\nABDOMINAL CRYPTORCHIDY.\r\n\r\nIn this severe form of the trouble under consideration, the various\r\nsteps of the operation demand careful study. Indeed, so common, so\r\nserious, and so frequently fatal are the complications which the surgeon\r\nmay expect to encounter, that many operators habitually discourage the\r\ninterference with this peculiar violation of normal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe first two steps of the operation are similar to those which belong\r\nto castration in inguinal cryptorchidy. Following on we have for the\r\n\r\n_Third step, the perforation of the inguinal canal_, or the\r\nestablishment, by the operator, of an artificial communication from\r\nwithout, with the abdominal cavity within. To effect this the surgeon\r\nintroduces his hand, with the fingers united in the form of a cone, into\r\nthe external inguinal ring, and carefully forces them upward towards the\r\nexternal angle of the ilium, resting them upon the crural arch. He soon\r\nreaches the closed superior inguinal ring, feeling only the peritoneal\r\nmembrane, where it is readily torn. Then tearing it sufficiently to\r\npermit the passage of the entire hand, or as large a portion of it as is\r\nnecessary, he has reached the\r\n\r\n_Fourth step, or the seizure and removal of the testicle._--The hand, or\r\nthree fingers, are then passed into the abdominal cavity, in order to\r\nfeel for the organ or its appendages, until the location is determined,\r\nwhether of testicle, epididymis, vas deferens, or blood vessels. These\r\nare usually found floating not far from the torn opening of the\r\nperitoneum. But if not so readily discovered, the hand must be carried\r\nabove the neck of the bladder, towards the end of the deferent canal,\r\nwhich must be followed until the epididymis or testicle is found. It is\r\nthen carefully brought outwards by a slow and steady traction upon the\r\ntesticle itself, or upon a portion of the epididymis, or even upon the\r\nextremity of some of the testicular blood vessels.\r\n\r\n_Fifth step._--The removal of the organ is always much more safely\r\neffected with the ecraseur than by other means. The operation is\r\ncompleted by the application of a suture upon the external wound, in\r\norder to guard effectually against the possibility of ventral hernia\r\noccurring subsequently.\r\n\r\nAbdominal cryptorchids are sometimes treated by removal through the\r\nflank--an operation intrinsically more dangerous, as well as less\r\npromising of success than that in the inguinal region.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS FOLLOWING THE OPERATION OF CASTRATION.\r\n\r\nThese will vary more or less in extent and severity, according to the\r\nmethod employed in its performance, and in any case they may be\r\nconsidered in two divisions; as primary or immediate, and secondary or\r\nconsecutive.\r\n\r\nAmongst the first phenomena most commonly observed is, of course, a\r\nmanifestation of pain, characterized by symptoms of colic, exhibited by\r\nthe animal in a more or less marked degree, being the result of the\r\nunavoidable irritation arising from the manipulations practised upon the\r\norgans of generation, whose nerves rise from the sympathetic as well as\r\nfrom the cerebro-spinal nervous system; and from the pain excited in the\r\nspermatic cord by the pressure of the clamps, for example. These colicky\r\npains, which are more severe under the bloodless method than in those of\r\nthe other mode, usually subside after the first hour following the\r\noperation, and as a rule require but little treatment more than that of\r\nthe walking exercise. This sort of pain having subsided, the only\r\nfurther trouble likely to be noticed is the local trouble resulting from\r\nthe lesion to which the testicular region has been subjected. Resulting\r\nfrom this local lesion, as well as from the rough manipulations\r\nattending the various steps of the different procedures, a peculiar\r\nstiffness will be observed in the motion of the animal. This may be\r\nreferred either to the local pain proper, to the dragging to which the\r\ncord has been subjected, or to the presence of the clamps, which,\r\nresting closely in the groin, necessarily more or less impede the action\r\nof locomotion.\r\n\r\nHemorrhage may also occur immediately after the operation, either while\r\nthe patient is still on the ground or as soon as he regains his feet.\r\nThis may be due either to the solution of continuity at the edges of the\r\nwound of the envelopes, or may proceed from the small testicular or the\r\nspermatic artery. The first two causes of hemorrhage need not engage our\r\nattention, usually ceasing spontaneously, and never being attended with\r\nserious inconvenience. It is not so, however, in the case of hemorrhage\r\nproceeding from the spermatic blood vessel proper, occurring after those\r\nmethods of operating which dispense with the closing of the artery by\r\nartificial appliances, as is done with the clamp or the ligature, or\r\nwhich may be observed in castration by torsion, cauterization, the use\r\nof the ecraseur, or especially by the process of simple excision. Though\r\nnot necessarily fatal, the hemorrhage in these instances may require\r\nprompt and effectual interference by the surgeon for its suppression.\r\n\r\nIt is not rare for castrated animals to become more or less tympanitic,\r\na condition which may be due, more or less, to the introduction of\r\natmospheric air into the abdominal cavity during the performance of the\r\noperation. This condition of things is usually remedied by the unaided\r\naction of natural causes.\r\n\r\nThe secondary effects also vary according to the manipulations of the\r\nmethod which they follow. The development of reactive fever is an event\r\nwhich in many cases requires close watching, and while it is true that\r\nmany castrated horses will manifest no subsequent illness, even to the\r\nextent of a slight elevation of temperature, others, on the contrary,\r\nshow unmistakable signs of a general inflammatory condition and this is\r\nthe more marked and definite as the condition of the wound has been left\r\nin a more or less complicated state. The presence of the ligature or of\r\na portion of the cord which has yet to complete the sloughing action,\r\nfollowing the method by cauterization and by the clamps, are sufficient\r\nto encourage the inflammatory tendency.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODES OF CICATRIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe cicatrization of the wound of castration takes place in two ways.\r\nWhile the upper part heals by adhesive inflammation at and above the\r\npoint where the amputation has been performed, it is below that point in\r\na process of cicatrization by the second intention, the parts filling up\r\nby the development of granulations, and being accused by an abundant\r\nsuppurative process. The first fact observed is that the parts become\r\nmore or less swollen. The swelling is at first limited to the edges of\r\nthe wound, but increases and spreads to the scrotum, then to the sheath,\r\nor even extends forwards and backwards to the perineal region. A flow of\r\nserosity will be observed almost immediately following the operation, at\r\nfirst thin and yellowish, but will, before the second or third day,\r\nbecome thicker and more purulent in character, so progressing that after\r\nthat period it will become a laudable, creamy pus, in evidence of the\r\nprocess going forward towards the establishment of sound and healthy\r\ncicatrization. This cicatrization will proceed until the healing is\r\ncomplete--that is, for a period varying between thirty and forty\r\ndays--the swelling slowly subsiding from the moment when the suppuration\r\nbecomes established.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYGIENE AND THE SUBSEQUENT ATTENTION.\r\n\r\nThe moment the patient has risen from his bed and has been thoroughly\r\ncleansed from the blood that has soiled his legs, it becomes necessary,\r\nif the clamps have been used, to apply the necessary means to prevent\r\ntheir removal by the action of the tail. This is done by braiding the\r\nhairs shortly, and sometimes tying it up on the side. Even when this is\r\nnot necessary, from the clamps not having been used, it is better to\r\nhave the tail tightened up short, in order, when the suppurative process\r\nis established, the more easily to preserve the cleanliness of that part\r\nof the body. It is recommended by some veterinarians, also, as soon as\r\nthe animal is on his feet, to have him thoroughly rubbed and dried,\r\nlest, as is not uncommon, he should have perspired excessively during\r\nthe operation. He may be warmly blanketed if he has been accustomed to a\r\ncovering, or in any case, placed in a quiet stall and tied up. If quiet\r\nand unexcited, and exhibiting no immediate ill consequences of the\r\noperation, he may, after an interval, be allowed to go loose in a box\r\nstall. If there are any manifestations of pain, or colicky symptoms,\r\nwalking exercise may be given. Quietness, protection from changes of the\r\nweather, moderate diet, varying according to his condition, are\r\nincluded in the only general instructions that can be given.\r\n\r\nThe wound simply requires to be kept clean. Washing with cool water and\r\nsoap when the discharge is well established, will fulfil this\r\nindication. The closing of the edges of the wound is to be carefully\r\nprevented by the introduction of the finger between them, care being\r\ntaken to avoid the laceration of any points where union has already\r\ntaken place in the upper part of the wound.\r\n\r\nIt is not an unusual thing to find even these simple measures of caution\r\noverlooked by gelders, some of them even recommending that the animal\r\nshould, immediately after the operation, be violently exercised--even\r\nput in harness and made to draw a wagon. It is true that a little and\r\ngentle exercise may be beneficial, with a view to the removal of the\r\nsoreness and pain of the newly castrated animal; it must be admitted\r\neven that Professor Bouley recommends slow exercise to be carried to the\r\nextent of fatiguing the animal. But when we take into consideration how\r\nseriously some animals, at least, are affected by the operation, and the\r\nserious complications which may follow it--even laying aside the\r\nhumanitarian view of the question--we must necessarily conclude that\r\nsuch directions and such a practice is in violation of all the laws of\r\ntrue surgery, and even if justified by the strongest statistics, is\r\ncondemned if confronted by a single fatal case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  COMPLICATIONS AND TREATMENT OF THE OPERATION -- COLICS -- TEARING OF\r\n  THE CLAMPS -- HEMORRHAGE -- SWELLING OF THE SCROTAL REGION -- GANGRENE\r\n  -- ABSCESSES -- CHAMPIGNON -- EXTRA SCROTAL -- INTRA SCROTAL -- INTRA\r\n  ABDOMINAL -- VARIOUS TREATMENTS -- FISTULA OF THE SCROTUM -- INGUINAL\r\n  HERNIA -- PERITONITIS -- TETANUS -- AMAUROSIS -- COMPARATIVE VIEW OF\r\n  THE VARIOUS MODES OF CASTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND THEIR TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThough the operation of castration is comparatively simple in its\r\nvarious methods and is generally successful in its results, still it is\r\nnot entirely free from accidents or complications. Indeed, among those\r\nlikely to meet our notice, there are some of quite a serious character,\r\nwhich will develop themselves independently of the skill and care with\r\nwhich the operation may have been performed or whatsoever attention may\r\nhave been bestowed upon the patient. Among these may be enumerated\r\n_colics_, _hemorrhage_, _swelling_ of the scrotum, _gangrene_,\r\n_abscesses_, _champignon_, _fistula_, _hernia_, _peritonitis_,\r\n_tetanus_, and _amaurosis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLICS.\r\n\r\nThis, we have already seen, usually appears a short time after the\r\ncompletion of the operation, the suffering animal becoming uneasy,\r\nrestless in his stall, pawing the ground with his fore feet, and\r\nsometimes lying down and rolling. As I have before stated, these\r\nsymptoms, as a rule, are of short duration, and subside without other\r\ntreatment than a little walking exercise. It is rarely the case that\r\nthey fail to yield to an anodyne, or a dose of chloral may be demanded\r\nbefore the symptoms are subdued.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEARING OF THE CLAMPS.\r\n\r\nWhen this accident occurs it is commonly attributable to the omission of\r\na careless operator to secure the tail of the animal in such a manner as\r\nto prevent its interference with those implements by its entanglement,\r\nand tearing them from the end of the cord, as a consequence. The result\r\nof this is the appearance of a hemorrhage from the spermatic artery,\r\nwhich can only be controlled by either a reapplication of the clamps to\r\nthe end of the cord--if it can be thus secured--or by other means, which\r\nwill be considered when we reach the subject of bleeding in general as\r\nconnected with other causes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMORRHAGE\r\n\r\nMay be primary or secondary. In the first instance it occurs in\r\nconsequence of the insufficiency of the means of hemostasis applied to\r\nthe end of the cord, as in the case of the operation by simple excision,\r\nby cauterization, the too rapid crushing of the cord, torsion, or the\r\naccident before referred to--when the clamps have been torn off and the\r\ncord lacerated about the point of their application.\r\n\r\nSecondary hemorrhage manifests itself after a longer interval following\r\nthe operation. It may occur, for example, after the removal of the\r\nclamps, or when, during their removal, the mortified end of the cord is\r\ntoo much interfered with by the sharp end of the instrument used in\r\ncutting the string which confines them together, or from too forcibly\r\npulling upon the cord itself; and in some instances without any\r\nassignable cause other than a diseased condition of the coats of the\r\nartery. This secondary hemorrhage is usually, by reason of the\r\ninflammatory condition of the blood vessels, of more threatening aspect\r\nand more difficult to control than the primary variety. The treatment\r\nindicated varies. When caused by the tearing of the clamps, or at the\r\ntime of their removal, it may be checked by the reapplication of the\r\ninstrument. But if the cord is retracted within the inguinal canal and\r\ncannot be reached, and if it is already adherent to the surrounding\r\ntissues, by granulations recently formed, the checking of the flow may\r\nbe very difficult. In many cases the application of cold water, either\r\nin the shape of the cold douche over the part, or iced sponges, may\r\nprove sufficient. But in other cases the cavity of the wound must be\r\npacked with balls of oakum, wet either with water alone or any styptic\r\nagent, such as a solution of perchloride of iron, the whole being kept\r\nin place by a suspensory bandage, or if necessary, a few points of\r\nsuture.\r\n\r\nThese measures may be put in practice while the animal is on his feet;\r\nbut if they fail in their effect, the surgeon must at once proceed to\r\ncast his patient and ligate the artery--an operation of delicate\r\nexecution, and not always easy to perform, by reason of the deep seated\r\nposition of the vessel. The use of the actual cautery has also been\r\nrecommended, but even when successful there are many objections to this,\r\none of which is the complication such an operation may bring on by the\r\nintroduction into the wound of a scab which must necessitate for its\r\nexpulsion a serious amount of inflammatory action. As a rule, however,\r\nthe operation of packing is all that is required, the oakum being left\r\nundisturbed for twenty-four or even thirty-six hours. Its removal must\r\nbe undertaken with great caution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWELLING OF THE SCROTAL REGION.\r\n\r\nThis, as we have seen, is an almost necessary consequence of the\r\noperation, the swelling making its appearance a short time after the\r\nalteration is accomplished. It usually first affects the parts\r\nimmediately around the edges of the wound, and spreads forwards and\r\nupwards in such a manner that the entire scrotum and sheath become the\r\nseat of it. It is somewhat warm, tense, and slightly painful. If there\r\nis no increase beyond these limits, there is no occasion for alarm, as\r\nby exercise, fomentations, and scarifications, with the administration\r\nof diuretics, it ordinarily subsides. But if it continues to increase,\r\nand extends upwards and backwards, involving the inside of the thighs\r\nand the perineum, loses its character of heat and soreness, to become\r\ncold and painless, crepitating under pressure, we must prepare to\r\nencounter the most severe of all complications, that of gangrene,\r\nrequiring the most prompt and vigorous treatment, as we shall presently\r\nsee. It may also happen that even while retaining the characteristics of\r\nhealthy œdema, it may assume such dimensions that the penis becomes so\r\ninvolved that phymosis and paraphymosis may supervene, to add to the\r\nother complications. These, however, are not serious sequelæ, as by\r\nproper care, with fomentations or scarifications, and the use of a\r\nsuspensory bandage, they may be readily overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nGANGRENE.\r\n\r\nThis accident may be looked for from the fourth to the eighth day,\r\nmanifesting itself not only by the extent which the œdema of the\r\nscrotal region assumes, and by its characteristics of coldness, loss of\r\nsensibility, and crepitant feeling, but by the fœtid odor proceeding\r\nfrom the wound, and by a change in the character, or the disappearance\r\nof the suppuration, which is succeeded by a sanious, bloody and\r\noffensive discharge. To this series of symptoms are to be added a marked\r\nincrease of the general disturbance, manifested by increased thirst,\r\nanorexia, fœtid mouth, change of color in the mucous membrane to a livid\r\nhue, increase of pulse, with weakening, increased respiration,\r\ntemperature at first elevated and then diminished, and after five or six\r\ndays a final termination in the death of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe progress of this complication is so rapid, and the chances of\r\nrecovery are so few, that the necessity for prompt treatment becomes at\r\nonce obvious. All the diseased and mortified parts must be removed at\r\nonce, and means instantly employed to prevent the absorption of\r\ngangrenous matter. Friction with ammoniacal and turpentine liniments\r\nmust be used over the swelling; the parts must be subjected to the\r\nactual cautery at white heat, and disinfecting agents of all kinds must\r\nbe freely used, as chloride of lime, carbolic acid, and permanganate of\r\npotash, while internal treatment must immediately be instituted by the\r\nadministration of stimulants and antiseptics in the form of ammonia and\r\nphenic acid, or its preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSCESSES.\r\n\r\nWhen these are likely to result from a too rapid closure of the edges of\r\nthe scrotal envelope, the premature union may be readily prevented, as\r\nwe have before stated, by the careful introduction of the finger into\r\nthe wound while it is still suppurating. But notwithstanding this\r\nprecaution they will sometimes occur as the result of the infiltration\r\nand accumulation of the suppurative matter. A free incision and proper\r\nattention to the cavity of the abscess, is all that this accident\r\nrequires. A careful examination of the parts will, however, reveal\r\nanother cause for the formation of these abscesses. It is then against\r\nthese causes that the therapeutic treatment must be directed. We refer\r\nnow to the complication known as the formation of a\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPIGNON.\r\n\r\nThis name is applied to an indurated condition of the end of the cord,\r\nor in its thickness, of a tumefied character, varying in size and\r\nextent, and slow in its growth. It results from an excess of\r\ninflammatory action, attributable to the manipulations which become\r\nnecessary during the performance of the operation. The name “champignon”\r\n(or mushroom) is applied to it by the French, on account of the\r\npedunculated appearance which it sometimes assumes, and which causes it\r\nto greatly resemble that fungus in its outward figure. It is also known\r\nas schirrous or indurated cord. The tumor is sometimes situated on the\r\noutside of the envelopes, when it is known as _extra-scrotal_, but more\r\ncommonly it is found covered by the skin, in which case it is better\r\nknown as _intra-scrotal_. In this latter condition it may be merely a\r\ngrowth at the end of the cord, becoming, as determined by its location,\r\nof an _extra-inguinal_ character, or if the diseased process extends as\r\nfar as the upper inguinal opening, or beyond it, it becomes, and is so\r\ndenominated, _intra-abdominal_. There is also an _extra-intra-scrotal_\r\ngrowth, when it is partly within and partly external to the scrotum.\r\nThis tumor will vary greatly in size, being sometimes very small in\r\ndimensions, and at others having those of a man’s fist. We have\r\nourselves observed it equalling a child’s head in size.\r\n\r\nThe causes from which it originates are obscure, and cannot be very well\r\ndefined. Still, they may be arranged under the heading of any of the\r\nmorbific causes which may excite an excess of inflammatory action at the\r\nend of the cord. Amongst these may be enumerated all violent tractions\r\nupon the cord at the time of the operation; all unnecessary\r\nmanipulations during the process of cicatrization, such as the too\r\nfrequent introduction of the finger into the wound with destruction of\r\nthe granulations already adherent to the cord, and the application of\r\nthe appliances for its division too low down upon it, leaving that organ\r\nhanging too much, and the retraction of the organ being insufficient to\r\nretain it in the inguinal sac. Still, as a champignon may be developed\r\nin the absence of all these causes, it would seem that their growth may\r\nbe attributed also to some specific idiosyncrasy in the animal affected,\r\nthe true nature of which cannot be very accurately or easily understood.\r\nIt is held, however, by certain German and Russian authors that\r\nexposure to cold exercises a great deal of influence in the development\r\nof this affection, and observation has largely established the fact of\r\nits greater prevalence during cold seasons.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of extra-scrotal champignon._--This is otherwise known in the\r\nterminology of some pathologists as _true_ or _superficial champignon_.\r\nIt develops itself at the cut extremity of the cord as a granulating\r\nmass, of a red color, varying in size, its growth, nevertheless,\r\nallowing the cicatrization of the skin to progress in such a manner that\r\nit forms a point of attachment from which the tumor seems to proceed.\r\nThis form of it is usually of little account, as it may easily be\r\nremoved before it has attained to troublesome dimensions. When of\r\nconsiderable proportions, however, it may interfere materially with the\r\nact of locomotion by causing pain in the cord, upon which it drags more\r\nor less. It is not often or necessarily accompanied by constitutional\r\ndisturbance, excepting in cases of excessive suppuration, which may\r\nsooner or later undermine the general health by exhausting the stamina\r\nof the patient.\r\n\r\nIf instead of showing its greatest development on the surface of the\r\nscrotum, it occurs beneath it, a greater or less degree of swelling will\r\nappear on one or both sides of the inguinal region, the swelling being\r\nsomewhat hard, possibly the seat of one or more fistulous tracks\r\nresulting from abscesses which have at times opened, discharged, and\r\nclosed; the animal showing a certain amount of stiffness in the action\r\nof the hind legs. In this case we shall have to adapt our treatment to\r\nthe _deep champignon_ of Zundel, under one of its three forms of\r\n_extra-inguinal_, _intra-inguinal_, and _intra-abdominal_.\r\n\r\nUnder the first head we shall often discover, upon inquiring into the\r\nhistory of the case, that for a length of time, varying from months,\r\nperhaps, to years, the animal had been affected with a swelling which\r\nwould gather, break, and slowly heal, leaving no mark as an apparent\r\nindication of a diseased condition, excepting that a certain degree of\r\nlameness would have been observed to be present. Upon exploring the\r\ntesticular region it would then be observed to be the seat of a tumor,\r\neither spherical or pysiform, seldom painful, and more or less adherent\r\nto the envelope that covered it. Above this the end may be felt free\r\nfrom diseased process, and this is the champignon in its chronic form.\r\nIn this condition it is not incompatible with the general health of the\r\nanimal affected, and forms no hindrance to his usefulness. This\r\ncondition of extra-inguinal growth will sometimes dissolve away by an\r\nabscess-formation, and quite disappear. But if the induration of the\r\nspermatic cord extends to the upper portion, or that which is enclosed\r\nin the inguinal canal, in such a manner as to interfere with locomotion,\r\nthe leg corresponding with the diseased side being carried in abduction,\r\nwith numerous fistulous tracks existing on the surface of the scrotum,\r\nthe intensity of the symptoms varying with the extent of the diseased\r\nprocess, the condition of the cord will be easily discovered by an\r\nexamination of the parts, and the presence of an _intra-inguinal\r\nchampignon_ established. If, besides these symptoms, we discover by\r\nrectal examination that there is in front of and above the pubes a tumor\r\nmore or less ovoid, or giving the sensation of a cylindrical mass, of\r\nsize varying to the touch--which is the diseased indurated cord--the\r\ncase is judged at once to be one of _intra-abdominal_ nature. At times\r\nthe inflammation may extend to the sub-lumbar region, when the hand\r\nintroduced into the rectum may discover in that locality an ovoid tumor\r\nor abscess which may be of great size. This form of champignon is\r\nincomparably the most serious of them all; an intense and persistent\r\nreactive fever is always present, and this at length terminates together\r\nthe life and suffering of the animal. The abscess may sometimes open\r\nexternally, and in some cases it may accumulate within the thickness of\r\nthe cord and form large collections; or, again, it may find its way into\r\nthe abdominal cavity, where it may excite a fatal peritonitis.\r\n\r\nThis rapid examination of the various forms of deep champignon will\r\nenable us easily to realize the difficulty of the progress in the case.\r\nWhile the pedunculated form, exterior to the scrotum, is not,\r\ncomparatively, a very serious matter, it becomes, on the contrary, a\r\nvery grave occurrence when it assumes the characters of the\r\nintra-abdominal variety, and must in a majority of cases be recognized\r\nas an incurable disorder.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--While champignon is an affection in which surgical\r\ninterference cannot usually be dispensed with, it is still essential\r\nthat the surgeon should avoid being over hasty in determining in favor\r\nof an operation, and he should give the case a very careful\r\nconsideration before deciding upon his course. At first emollient\r\napplications, appropriate topical treatment, and a few points of\r\ncauterization, may be followed by a process of resolution. But in the\r\nevent of their failure four modes of operation present themselves. These\r\nare, in their order, the application of the clamps; the ligature; the\r\nlinear crushing or ecraseur; and cauterization. When the case is one of\r\nthe extra-scrotal variety, the application of a ligature around the base\r\nof the peduncle, or removal by ecraseur, will be the simplest mode of\r\ntreatment, unless there should exist a tendency to infiltration of the\r\ncord, in which case the manipulations to be followed become the same as\r\nthose which are adapted to that of the deep or intra-scrotal form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.\r\n\r\nCURVED CLAMPS.]\r\n\r\n_By the clamps._--When the application of the clamps is resorted to,\r\nthey may be similar to those used in ordinary castration, or may be\r\ncurved in form (Fig. 25). The animal to be operated on is to be thrown\r\non either side according to which cord is affected, and an incision\r\nmade through the envelopes as nearly parallel with the median line of\r\nthe body as the case permits, when the tumor and the cord are carefully\r\ndissected and separated from their adhesions. If the tumor is suspended\r\nfrom the end of the cord there will be no difficulty in applying the\r\nclamp above it and upon a healthy portion of the cord. But if the\r\ndiseased process extends within the inguinal canal, there will be need\r\nof great caution in dissecting the cord up to the healthy structure. In\r\ndoing this the safer mode will be for the operator to treat the\r\nadhesions with the fingers or the blunt end of the scissors, rather than\r\nto employ the sharp edge of the bistoury with the accompanying danger of\r\ncausing hemorrhage. If, on the contrary, the cord is diseased to an\r\nextent that renders it difficult to reach a healthy portion, other modes\r\nof operation--as by the ligature--become the wiser and more practicable\r\nindication. When the clamps are used it is necessary to leave them in\r\nplace for several days, and sometimes they are allowed to slough off,\r\nwhile the growth is usually suffered to remain for a few days after the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.\r\n\r\nLIGATURE-CARRIER.]\r\n\r\n_Ligature._--When this mode of procedure is adopted, the tumor having\r\nbeen dissected and the cord well freed from its adhesions with\r\nsurrounding parts, and the ligature being applied, the tumor may either\r\nbe amputated immediately or be left to slough off in its own time. The\r\nligature may be either of twine, silk, or elastic cord. We have\r\nourselves operated by this method in the successful removal of growths\r\nof very considerable size. So long as the upper portion of the cord,\r\nwhich retains its healthy structure, can be reached, the application of\r\nthe ligature is attended with no difficulty, the manipulations required\r\nbeing similar to those which attend the removal of all growths by the\r\nprocess of ligation. But if the diseased process extends so far that the\r\nligature cannot be applied at the proper point, as in the case of\r\nintra-inguinal champignon, it will be necessary to have resort to the\r\nligature-carrier recommended by Serres (Fig. 26). In using this\r\ninstrument the loop of the ligature being passed over the tumor around\r\nthe cord, is carried into the inguinal canal as high up as possible,\r\npressure being made by holding the instrument against the cord, while\r\nstrong traction is made on the ends of the ligature, which is then\r\nsecured by a knot upon a small stick placed across the opening of the\r\ninstrument, with a view to the prevention of slipping. If an increase of\r\npressure is found to be necessary, it can easily be obtained by\r\ntightening the ligature from day to day as required. If the size of the\r\ncord should be such as to prevent a proper application of a single\r\nligature, it may become necessary to divide it in applying a double,\r\ntriple, or multiple ligatures, in accordance with the rules for such\r\nligating.\r\n\r\nIn whatsoever manner the ligature may be applied, even when it is of the\r\nelastic kind, the process of sloughing of the tissues is always a slow\r\none. It is for this reason that we agree with Prof. Bouley in\r\nconsidering the treatment of champignon by the linear crushing very much\r\nto be preferred.\r\n\r\n_Ecraseur._--The steps of the operation with this instrument are similar\r\nto those required in the other methods already considered. The\r\nchampignon is isolated from its surrounding parts, the chain is placed\r\non the cord above the base of the tumor, and the amputation is completed\r\nby a slow pressure upon the cord, which, crushing it by degrees, permits\r\nits immediate removal. It must be done slowly, occupying from ten to\r\ntwenty minutes for the complete separation of the champignon, according\r\nto the size of the tumor. The operation being finished, the parts are\r\nleft in the condition of a simple wound, where no cause exists to\r\ninterfere with its rapid cicatrization.\r\n\r\n_Cauterization._--This is a mode of treatment which we have never had\r\noccasion to submit to trial, having always given the preference to the\r\nprocess we have just referred to. It is recommended, however, by\r\nEuropean authorities. Some of these advocate the “melting” process, or\r\nthe introduction of sharp points deeply into the thickest parts of the\r\nenlargement, while others advise a removal of a portion of the growth\r\nand deep cauterization afterwards. If cauterization can be\r\nadvantageously employed, the best method, in our judgment, would be the\r\nprocess of amputation with Paccalin, or with the galvanic cautery. We\r\nmay here, while referring to the application of electricity in this\r\nconnection, appropriately refer to our own experience of a number of\r\nyears ago, in treating an animal suffering with intra-scrotal\r\nchampignon, by electrolysis, and succeeding after two applications, in\r\nobtaining the complete removal of the tumor. This method, however,\r\nconsumes too much time to justify its employment in general practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISTULA OF THE SCROTUM.\r\n\r\nBeing already aware of several causes of this complication of the\r\noperation of castration, we may readily appreciate the treatment they\r\nrequire. It must be remembered that in a majority of cases, the cause of\r\nthis lesion is the presence of a foreign body in the wound, and that\r\nuntil it is removed, it is in vain to look for a cure. Prof. Bouley has\r\nreported a case in which the fistula was due to the presence of a pair\r\nof clamps over which the skin had almost entirely cicatrized.\r\n\r\n\r\nINGUINAL HERNIA; HERNIA OF CASTRATION.\r\n\r\nBy this is understood the protrusion of some portion of the contents of\r\nthe abdominal cavity through the inguinal ring, either a portion of the\r\nomentum or of some part of the small intestines, creating either an\r\nepiplocele or an enterocele. This complication may take place either\r\nduring the operation, or shortly afterwards, or at the period of the\r\nremoval of the clamps. It proceeds from the violent struggling of the\r\nanimal during the operation; to the colics which are so apt to\r\nsupervene; to his position when placed in a stall of which the floor is\r\ntoo much inclined; or it may result from some of the various modes of\r\ncastration, as, for example, the uncovered operation.\r\n\r\nAt times the two forms of hernia may present themselves together,\r\nconstituting a case of entero-epiplocele. When the epiploan alone\r\nprotrudes, it need not give rise to any unnecessary anxiety, as it may\r\neasily be either reduced and returned to its place, or ligated with the\r\nclamps, or torn apart. If, on the contrary, it is a portion of the small\r\nintestines which becomes involved, the first indication is to restore it\r\nto its place by the proper taxis without delay, which may be readily\r\ndone, the animal being yet down and placed under an anesthetic, by the\r\nrectal taxis combined with the necessary inguinal manipulations. When\r\nthis has been accomplished the intestine is kept in place by the\r\napplication of a clamp over the cord, upon which the fibrous coat of the\r\ncremaster has been carefully drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERITONITIS.\r\n\r\nThis complication, considered as one of the most frequent following\r\ncastration, is also, beyond doubt, one of the most serious. It is\r\ngenerally the result of exposure to cold, especially when its occurrence\r\naccompanies the suppurative fever. But it also develops itself in\r\nanimals which have received the best hygienic care, its appearance being\r\nattributed to an excessive dragging of the cord, or to the extension of\r\nthe local inflammation by continuity of tissues. It manifests itself\r\ngenerally between the second and third day following the operation,\r\nexcept when it becomes symptomatic, as of gangrene of the cord, when we\r\nhave seen it making its appearance towards the tenth day.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of this traumatic peritonitis differ somewhat from those of\r\nthe acute inflammatory type. According to Gourdon, “the animal is dull\r\nand refuses all food--the suppuration of the wound of the scrotum has\r\nceased, the bags and surrounding parts become the seat of a warm, hard\r\nand painful swelling. The animal stands with his four legs brought close\r\ntogether, the back is stiff and arched, the flanks are cordy, the\r\nabdomen painful, the pulse hard, small and increased. As the disease\r\nprogresses, the symptoms are more marked, the enlargement of the\r\nenvelopes increases and is more diffuse, it extends down to the abdomen,\r\nand even under the chest, passes along the thighs, is less warm, less\r\nhard, less painful, and pits under pressure. There are slight colics,\r\nthe pulse gets smaller, intermittent, the respiration is increased, and\r\nthe animal dies towards the fifth or sixth day.”\r\n\r\nThe treatment to be recommended varies according to different authors.\r\nWhile some prescribe depletive and sedative treatment, laxatives and\r\ndiuretics, many prefer tonics and stimulants. The Germans claim great\r\nresults from the use of tincture of arnica (in small doses) administered\r\ninternally. The external treatment consists in sinapisms, warm\r\nfomentations, poultices, or fumigations under the abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTETANUS.\r\n\r\nAs with most cases of traumatic tetanus, this complication is generally\r\nfatal, and it is, without doubt, the most dangerous of all and marked by\r\nthe greatest mortality. It is generally admitted that exposure to cold\r\nand dampness is one of the most prolific causes, especially in animals\r\nwhich, having but recently recovered, are too soon put to work. The\r\nvarious modes of operation have also been considered to have some\r\ninfluence upon its development, though there is probably no ground upon\r\nwhich this theory can find a support. Whether the nature of the soil of\r\na district, or its atmospheric condition, may have any connection with\r\nit, is also a question. We know that in some portions of Long Island,\r\ncases of tetanus are commonly met with, at some seasons of the year,\r\nafter surgical operations of every kind. It may appear within a few days\r\nfollowing the castration, or it may defer its visitation for a period of\r\ntwenty days, or longer.\r\n\r\nThe treatment adopted for the tetanus of castration is that which is\r\napplied to all cases of that traumatic affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMAUROSIS.\r\n\r\nThis disease may also be included among those classed as the sequelæ of\r\ncastration, having been known to follow cases where hemorrhage of the\r\nsmall testicular artery had occurred. Tonic treatment internally and\r\nlocal stimulating applications may sometimes relieve this complication,\r\nbut it will generally be admitted to be incurable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE VARIOUS MODES OF CASTRATION.\r\n\r\nThe process by _simple excision_, by reason of the hemorrhage which\r\nnecessarily accompanies it, though not inevitably dangerous, must be\r\nexcluded from the domain of general practice.\r\n\r\nThat of _scraping the cord_ has not, so far as our knowledge extends,\r\nbeen sufficiently tested, either in European or American practice, to\r\njustify its recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe process of _torsion below the epididymis_ is too much subject to the\r\ndevelopment of champignon, as well as that of _free torsion_ with the\r\nhands, to be admitted by judicious operators, while the _limited\r\ntorsion_ is a method which has taken rank amongst safe operators,\r\nnotwithstanding the enormous swelling of the parts by which it is\r\ncommonly accompanied, and the necessity it involves of the introduction\r\nof the fingers into the wound to prevent its premature closing.\r\n\r\nThe method by the _ecraseur_, though occupying a longer time in its\r\ncompletion than some others, has secured very favorable results,\r\nespecially in the hands of American operators.\r\n\r\nThe operation by _cauterization_ is highly recommended by English\r\nveterinarians. We believe, contrary to the statements of French authors,\r\nthat it is not widely in use on this Continent. The objections urged\r\nagainst it are that the hemostatic effect upon the cord is less reliable\r\nthan in the method by the clamps or the ligature; that there is more or\r\nless danger of cauterizing the surrounding parts by the effect of the\r\nradiant heat from the cautery; and that the swelling which follows the\r\noperation is always excessively great.\r\n\r\nCastration by the _clamps_ is the best known and most extensively\r\npractised. It is easy and quick in its performance; performs the most\r\ncertain hemostasis upon the artery, and notwithstanding some slight\r\nobjections, merits a preference over all others. The principal objection\r\nalleged against it is that it is attended with great pain to the\r\nsuffering patient when the pressure of the instrument upon the soft\r\ntissues is first felt. This is a doubtful question, and if this\r\nexcessive amount of pain really exists, it certainly cannot be of long\r\ncontinuance, merely on account of the effect produced by the clamps\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOf the various methods by _ligature_, that of the ligation of the cord\r\nwith its envelopes is applicable to small animals only. That upon the\r\ncord alone is liable to be followed by hemorrhage, or by the excessive\r\nretraction of the cord into the abdominal cavity, drawing the ligature\r\nwith it. That of the efferent canal, and of the cord by the subcutaneous\r\nmode are not admitted in general practice, while that of the artery\r\nalone has not been extensively performed on large animals, so far as we\r\nare informed, except by certain Massachusetts veterinarians.\r\n\r\nThe castration by _double subcutaneous twisting_, when extensively\r\napplied to solipeds, will probably prove to be the safest mode of all,\r\nand least likely to be followed by complications. We are not informed as\r\nto the extent to which it has been practised in this country, even\r\namongst ruminants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  CASTRATION OF FEMALES -- HISTORY -- INDICATIONS -- EFFECTS UPON THE\r\n  ORGANISM AND SPECIAL FUNCTIONS -- ADVANTAGES IN COWS -- CONDITIONS\r\n  FAVORABLE TO THE OPERATION -- ANATOMY -- MODUS OPERANDI -- BY THE\r\n  FLANKS -- CHARLIER’S PROCESS -- INSTRUMENTS -- VARIOUS STEPS --\r\n  DIVISION OF THE VAGINA -- SEIZING THE OVARY -- TWISTING IT OFF --\r\n  COMPLICATIONS -- HEMORRHAGE -- PERITONITIS -- ABSCESS OF THE PELVIC\r\n  CAVITY -- CONSTIPATION -- SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA -- CASTRATION OF THE\r\n  SMALL ANIMALS -- OF SWINE -- OF SLUTS -- OF FOWLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have stated before, the revival of the operation of castration upon\r\nlarge females is due to a Louisiana farmer, Thomas Winn, who, in the\r\nyear 1831, castrated several of his cows.\r\n\r\nWithout entering upon the history which includes a record of the\r\nfailures and successes attendant upon the introduction of the operation,\r\nit may suffice to say that until the improvements made by Charlier in\r\nthe manipulations involved in the operation, it encountered considerable\r\nopposition, and it is within a comparatively recent period that it has\r\nbecome established in the domains of veterinary surgery.\r\n\r\nThe indications by which this operation commend itself to\r\nagriculturists, and others who find profit or pleasure in the use or\r\nownership of these domestic animals, are several. Among them are the\r\ninfluence which it exercises upon the secretion of milk in cows, and\r\nupon the power of accumulating fat, and its effects upon the character\r\nand temper of all the large females, in which relation it obviously acts\r\nas a therapeutic agent, in overcoming certain peculiar conditions by\r\nwhich they are distinguished. In respect to the effect of the operation\r\nof spaying the cow upon the milk secretion, it is a fact well\r\nestablished that it not only increases the amount and duration of the\r\nflow, but also improves the quality of that valuable fluid, the spayed\r\ncow not only continuing the production from eighteen to twenty-four\r\nmonths, but giving a product far richer in the elements of nutrition.\r\nThis is shown by the enhanced proportions of the cream, the caseine and\r\nthe sugar, which determine its richness and value, both economically and\r\ncommercially, after alteration.\r\n\r\nBut even this argument in favor of spaying the cow is rendered more\r\nweighty by the fact that besides its influence on the milky secretion,\r\nthere is also that which is furnished by the consideration of its effect\r\nin augmenting the deposit of fat throughout the frame, for it is through\r\nthis tendency that the flesh of the animal becomes so greatly improved\r\nin its nutritive quality as compared with that of the same species when\r\nin the entire condition, becoming so noticeably more tender, juicy and\r\npalatable, retaining more of the oily element, digesting more easily,\r\nand so, of course, acquiring a pecuniary value in the market not before\r\npossessed. These remarks apply to the dry equally with the milch cow,\r\nand leaving out the reference to the milk secretion, to the ox as well.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the effect of the operation upon the character and\r\ndisposition of the cow, these are easily illustrated in the movements of\r\nthe nymphomaniac animal, which may be said to be constantly in a state\r\nof hysterical excitement. They seem to be in continual conditions of\r\nheat, running after and mounting other animals with which they may be in\r\ncompany, while never producing and giving no milk. They are always in a\r\nlean condition, and must remain a pecuniary loss to the dairyman. This\r\nmanifestation of nymphomania is also met with in the mare, which,\r\ncontinually exhibiting signs of heat, becomes more or less dangerous on\r\nthat account. In these cases the advantage of the operation of spaying\r\ncannot be overlooked. We have personal knowledge of several cases of\r\nthis character, in which worthless and troublesome mares have been\r\ntransformed into docile and valuable animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO THE OPERATION.\r\n\r\nCharlier expresses the opinion that the best time for the performance of\r\nthe operation upon cows is from the sixth to the eighth year, or after\r\nthey have had their second or third calf. If performed at an earlier\r\nperiod the great objection originally urged against castration, that its\r\nperformance would tend to the diminution of the stock in numbers or\r\n“population,” might find more or less confirmation. But by an observance\r\nof this condition all danger of the annihilation of stock would be\r\nobviated. The cow to be operated on ought to be in fair condition, not\r\nin heat or pregnant, and the time selected should be from forty to sixty\r\ndays after calving.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY.\r\n\r\nThe _vagina_ is situated within the pelvic cavity, between the rectum\r\nand the bladder. Its internal face presents numerous longitudinal folds,\r\nthe purpose of which is to permit the free dilatation of the parts. At\r\nthe bottom of the passage is situated the _neck of the uterus_, giving\r\nto the finger the sensation of a projection, hard towards the cavity of\r\nthe vagina, and in the centre of which is felt a closed opening, from\r\nwhich radiate the folds of the mucous membrane. The _uterus_ (Figs. 27\r\nand 28), continued forward to the neck, is situated in the abdominal\r\ncavity, occupying the sub-lumbar region, with its posterior extremity\r\nresting at the end of the pelvic cavity. It is somewhat pyriform in\r\nshape, and larger at its base, where it divides into two lateral halves,\r\ncontinued by the _horns_. The concave curvature of these horns look\r\ndownward in the cow, but face upwards in the mare. In both they give\r\nattachment to the _broad ligaments_. These are folds of the peritoneum,\r\nmore developed forward than behind, rising from the sub-lumbar region,\r\nand descending towards the uterus, to fix themselves upon the sides of\r\nthe superior face of the body of this organ, and, as before stated, upon\r\nthe curvature of the horns. Their anterior border is free, and gives\r\nsupport to the oviducts and the ovaries. Between the serous layers are\r\nfound the utero-ovarian artery and veins, largely developed. The\r\n_ovaries_ are situated on the internal face of the broad ligament,\r\nforming a small ovoid mass, which receives a special serous lamella, a\r\nsort of ligament, having between its layers a few grayish muscular\r\nfibres, which may be strong enough to offer serious resistance when the\r\nextirpation of the organ is attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODUS OPERANDI.\r\n\r\nThere are two modes of operation. The original method was that of\r\nremoval through the flanks, which, however, has fallen into disuse since\r\nthe introduction of the process of Charlier, of removal through the\r\nvagina. This process is altogether to be preferred, as being safer, more\r\nconsistent with scientific surgery, and in a word is the only one which\r\nit is proper to perform, so long as the capacity of the vagina permits\r\nthe necessary manipulations to be performed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.\r\n\r\nRIGHT OVARY OF THE COW WITH ITS ATTACHMENTS.\r\n\r\nU.--Right horn of the uterus.

The first\r\nis securing the animal. The cow is usually kept on her feet, pressed\r\nfirmly against a wall, the legs secured with hobbles, and her head\r\ncontrolled, as much as possible, by a strong assistant. The second step\r\nis the incision of the flank. This is made on the left side, with a\r\nsharp, convex bistoury, in the middle of the superior portion of that\r\nregion, dividing the skin and muscles vertically, care being taken that\r\nthe incision is not carried too low down, in order to avoid the division\r\nof the circumflex artery, which passes along in that vicinity. An\r\nopening is then made in the peritoneum, either with the knife or with\r\nthe fingers, sufficiently large to permit the introduction of the\r\nfingers. In the third step of the operation, which comprehends the\r\nremoval of the ovary, the surgeon introduces his hand into the abdomen,\r\nand turning it towards the pelvis, feels for the horns of the uterus.\r\nUpon finding these the ovaries are easily discovered. He carefully draws\r\nthem outwards, and their removal is effected either with the ecraseur or\r\nthe forceps of Charlier. The operation is concluded by the application\r\nof a quill suture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--CHARLIER’S VAGINAL SPECULUM.\r\n\r\n(Closed.) (Open.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.\r\n\r\nMODIFIED VAGINAL SPECULUM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.\r\n\r\nBISTOURY CACHÉ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.\r\n\r\nCOLIN’S BISTOURY CACHÉ.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLIER’S METHOD--INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nFor this operation special instruments are required. These consist of,\r\nfirst, a vaginal dilator (Fig. 29), or speculum, of peculiar and\r\nsomewhat complicated construction, to be modified subsequently by\r\nanother (Fig 30), of superior form and easier of application, and now in\r\ngeneral use; second, a bistoury caché (Fig. 31), sliding on its handles,\r\nwhich is a true embryotomy knife, modified by Colin (Fig. 32); third, a\r\npair of long, sharp scissors (Fig. 33), with guarded blades, curved on\r\nits flat surface; fourth, a torsion forceps (Fig. 34), closed by a\r\npeculiar thread arrangement, moved by the handle; and fifth, a steel\r\nthimble (Fig. 35), which has been modified by the instrument shown in\r\nFig. 36, and which is used in applying the limited torsion on the\r\nbroad ligaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.\r\n\r\nSCISSORS TO DIVIDE THE BROAD LIGAMENT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.\r\n\r\nFORCEPS FOR CASTRATION OF COWS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--THIMBLE FOR CASTRATION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--COLIN’S NIPPERS, to take the place of the\r\nthimble.]\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the animal._--No general preparation is required, except\r\none, which may be regarded as of local effect, but is not to be\r\noverlooked. This consists in the evacuation of the bowels by means of a\r\nrectal injection, in order that the arms of the surgeon may not become\r\nunnecessarily soiled during the operation. The animal is secured on her\r\nfeet by being placed in a narrow stall to prevent her from moving from\r\nside to side, the floor of the stall having an inclination forwards, in\r\norder to prevent the pressure by gravitation of the intestinal mass\r\ntowards the posterior parts of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe operation is completed in two steps, of which the first is the\r\nincision of the vagina, and the second the extirpation of the ovaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCISION IN THE VAGINA.\r\n\r\nThis is made in the following manner. The operator introduces the\r\nspeculum with his right hand, through the vulva, into the vaginal\r\ncavity, and carefully passing in his left hand, well oiled, directs and\r\nintroduces the little prolongation A of the speculum into the centre of\r\nthe neck of the uterus, gently pressing upon it in order to keep it in\r\nplace. In using the original dilator, the opening of the branches must\r\nbe so regulated as to put the walls of the vagina upon the stretch. Or,\r\nif he uses the modified speculum, he pushes the instrument downwards and\r\nforwards, and by this motion distends the upper wall of the cavity,\r\nkeeping the instrument in that position by a hold of the left hand,\r\nwhich has been withdrawn from the vagina. He then arms himself with the\r\nbistoury caché, which he holds closed in his full hand and introduces\r\nwith the right hand into the vagina. Carefully feeling the condition of\r\nthe upper wall of this cavity, and assuring himself of its being well\r\nstretched, he rests his hand, still holding the bistoury, upon the\r\nopening or “window” at the end of the speculum (Figs. 37 and 38), and by\r\nfirmly pushing the blade (the sharp edge being turned backwards) out of\r\nits handle, pierces with it the vaginal walls, about two inches above\r\nthe neck of the uterus, and with a motion from below upwards and from\r\nbefore backwards, makes an incision on the median line, from three to\r\nthree and a half inches in length. The introduction of the instrument\r\nmust be made in such a manner that it will pass at once through the\r\nwalls of the vagina proper, as well as through the peritoneal cap which\r\nit presents at its anterior portion.\r\n\r\nThe incision being completed, the speculum is carefully withdrawn; and\r\nif a slight hemorrhage should occur, the blood should be removed before\r\nthe surgeon proceeds to the second step of the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF COWS. (Charlier’s process).\r\n\r\nIncision of the vagina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF COWS. (Charlier’s process).\r\n\r\n1st step. Incision of the vagina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.\r\n\r\nSCISSORS DIVIDING THE BROAD LIGAMENTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF THE OVARIES.\r\n\r\nThen, again introducing his hand into the vagina, and passing his finger\r\nthrough the opening made by the incision, he feels for the ovaries,\r\nwhich he finds floating at the extremity of their ligaments, towards the\r\nentrance of the pelvis, below, on each side, and at a short\r\ndistance from the incision, between the base of the uterine horns, near\r\nand inside of the free border of the ligaments, and a little above the\r\nanterior border of the pubis. Then, grasping the ovarian body, he draws\r\nit carefully into the vagina, through the incision, and introduces the\r\nlong scissors, with the guarded blade of which he divides the thick\r\nborder of the broad ligament (Fig. 39), replacing the ovaries into the\r\nabdomen without releasing his hold. The torsion forceps is then passed\r\ninto the vagina and through the incision, and is made to take hold with\r\nits open jaws of the broad ligament (Fig. 40), above the ovary, and is\r\nfirmly closed by the movement of the spiral crank of the handle (D).\r\nBoth hands being now outside of the vaginal cavity, and the forceps\r\nbeing secured on the broad ligament, held by the right hand, the left\r\nthumb is protected by the thimble (E), and the hand once more inserted,\r\nto grasp the broad ligament above the point where the jaws of the\r\ntorsion forceps are placed. In this position the torsion is made with\r\nthe forceps, the twisting of the ligament being limited by the firm\r\npressure made by the thimble on the thumb with the index finger, or by a\r\npair of crushing pincers. After several turns of the instrument, the\r\novary is separated from its attachment, and may be brought out of the\r\ncavity, still held securely between the oval jaws of the torsion\r\nforceps. The same method is applicable to the ovaries of both sides.\r\nThese rules are subject to more or less modification by indications\r\nwhich may occasionally present themselves, arising from the age of\r\nthe animal or the structure or other conditions of the ovaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--TORSION OF THE OVARY.\r\n\r\nA B--Forceps closed. B C--Forceps open. E--Thimble.]\r\n\r\nThis method of castration has been modified in many ways, both as to the\r\nforms of the instruments used, and the mode of using them, a majority of\r\noperators, at the present time even, discarding the dilator, and making\r\nthe incision simply by stretching the walls of the vagina and pushing\r\nagainst the neck of the uterus with the hand. The manner in which the\r\nremoval of the ovaries is effected has also been subjected to many\r\nchanges. For more than twenty years, during which we have been\r\nperforming the operation, we have been accustomed to use the ecraseur in\r\nthe last step, and with excellent and satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent attention required by the spayed cow is usually a very\r\nsimple matter, and involves little beyond careful dieting, the patient\r\nrecovering from the general effects upon the system usually in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nIt may properly be said that there are no complications likely to follow\r\nthe process in the castration of cows, which may be denominated serious.\r\nIn the statistics which record the mortality attending it, the fatal\r\ncases are represented at the very trifling rate of two per cent. A light\r\ncolic may sometimes follow it, but it usually subsides without medical\r\ntreatment. Still, however, spaying may at times be accompanied by\r\naccidents of a serious character, though these have considerably\r\ndiminished in frequency since the introduction of the method of\r\nCharlier. One of these is\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMORRHAGE,\r\n\r\nwhich may occur when the torsion or the crushing of the artery has not\r\nbeen sufficiently complete. But though it is likely to give rise to\r\nperitonitis, it is not necessarily a fatal complication. We have\r\nourselves known of cases of its occurrence in mares which had survived\r\nit a number of days, and when destroyed exhibited none of the lesions of\r\nthat affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERITONITIS.\r\n\r\nWe have several times met with this sequel to the operation, especially\r\nin mares. But in these cases, as revealed by _post mortem_\r\ninvestigation, the disease seemed generally to have remained localized.\r\nLess common than prior to the practice of castration per vagina, it\r\nstill is followed by fatal consequences when the entire peritoneum\r\nbecomes diseased. Its appearance usually occurs from the third to the\r\nsixth day. There is suspension of the milky secretion, general dullness,\r\nchills, anorexia, suspension of rumination, rapid, small and thready\r\npulse, sometimes painful respiration, rapid loss of flesh, and\r\nspeedily--death. The indications of treatment are similar to those which\r\nare applicable to peritonitis in the solipeds, but the prognosis is\r\nalways serious.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSCESS IN THE PELVIC CAVITY.\r\n\r\nThis is a complication we have quite often encountered. Besides the\r\ngeneral symptoms, there are those of a local character, which are\r\ndetected by rectal examination, by which discovery is made of the\r\npresence of a tumor on one side or the other of the vagina, varying in\r\nsize, fluctuating, and easily identified. This abscess may be opened in\r\nthe cavity of the vagina, and should be attended to as soon as discovery\r\nis made of the fluctuating character of the growth, without waiting for\r\nthe process of natural resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA.\r\n\r\nEmphysema of the subcutaneous connective tissue is said to be a common\r\nsequel to the flank operation. Its appearance need not excite any\r\nspecial uneasiness, as its termination is usually by spontaneous\r\ndisappearance. It is an accident we have never encountered in our\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\nThis complication, which is often met with in mares, is to be carefully\r\nlooked for, and must be relieved by laxative food and rectal injections.\r\nIt is due to the pain which accompanies defecation while the wound of\r\nthe vagina is healing, and which the animal tries to avoid by keeping\r\nthe rectum full.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF THE SMALL ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nSMALL RUMINANTS.\r\n\r\nFor these subjects, two modes of operation are to be principally\r\nrecommended. The first is the double subcutaneous torsion; the other the\r\nligature _en masse_ of the cord and its envelopes. Having already\r\nconsidered these operations, a passing reference will suffice here.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR SWINE.\r\n\r\nIn _males_, the varying modes employed are the ligature, limited\r\ntorsion, and the clamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.\r\n\r\nGENITAL ORGANS OF A YOUNG SOW.\r\n\r\n(Median and antero-posterior section). 1--Ovary. 2--Horn of the uterus.\r\n3--Body of the uterus. 4--Rectum. 5--Vagina. 6--Bladder. 7--Kidney.\r\n9--Intestines. 10--Stump of one of the horns of the uterus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.\r\n\r\nBISTOURY FOR THE CASTRATION OF SOW.\r\n\r\n(Division of the flank).]\r\n\r\nIn _females_, it must be remembered that the horns of the uterus are\r\nvery long and flexuous (Fig. 41), and that the very small ovaries are\r\nsituated on the inside of the broad ligaments, which are very large, and\r\nallow the horns to float freely amongst the circumvolutions of the\r\nintestines. The animal must be prepared by being secured upon the right\r\nside in order to expose the left flank. The incision is made with a\r\nknife of peculiar form (Fig. 42), the coarse bristles having been\r\npreviously closely clipped off. Care should be taken to carry the left\r\nleg in extension backwards, in such a manner that the edges of the\r\nvarious tissues divided shall not meet each other when the operation is\r\ncompleted. The incision may be made either vertically, horizontally, or\r\nobliquely. When vertical it should be immediately below the lumbar\r\nvertebra next to the last rib; if horizontal it should be parallel with\r\nthe vertebral column. The vertical incision should be preferred, because\r\nit brings the ovaries within easy reach of the fingers. It should be\r\nfrom two to three inches in length, and should be made by a single\r\nstroke of the knife, and without dividing the peritoneum, which should,\r\nafterwards, be either torn with the finger or carefully cut while raised\r\nwith the forceps. To find the ovaries the operator introduces the index\r\nfinger of the right hand between the vertebral column and the\r\nintestines, and explores the lumbar region. Upon finding the ovarian\r\nsac, he presses it against the abdominal wall and causes it to slide by\r\npushing towards the opening through which it is extruded and grasped.\r\nWhile it is held there the left horn is carefully drawn out after it,\r\nuntil arriving at the bifurcation of the horns at the uterus, the right\r\nhorn also is brought out and the ovary on that side secured. Both glands\r\nbeing now outside, they are torn or scraped off from their attachment,\r\nand the horns are returned to the abdomen.\r\n\r\nWhile this process is readily applicable to young sows, and requires a\r\ncertain amount of practice to be performed expertly and with success, it\r\nis slightly modified when applied to older animals. In that case the two\r\nhorns must not be exposed outside together, but each must be returned\r\nwhen the removal of the ovary connected with it has been effected.\r\n\r\nThe simple tearing of the ovaries is not always sufficient, and may be\r\nsometimes followed by serious hemorrhage. The scraping and the torsion\r\nare safer, and in some instances the ligature has been applied. The\r\nincision is closed with the interrupted or, which is preferable, the\r\ncontinued suture. No special after-treatment is required beyond low diet\r\nfor a few days, with a little extra attention to cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe operation may at times be rendered difficult by exceptional and\r\naccidental conditions, as, for example, the shortness of the fingers of\r\nthe operator. This difficulty, however, can be overcome by placing a\r\nbundle of straw or other substance under the right flank, which, by\r\nraising the body displaces the intestines upwards and crowds the ovary\r\ntowards the left flank.\r\n\r\nIt may also happen, as sometimes with old sows, that the ovary has\r\nbecome the seat of large cysts, or that its size is increased in\r\nconsequence of pathological changes in its structure. In the first case,\r\nthe cyst may be punctured and emptied with a trochar before attempting\r\nthe obliteration of the organ. In the second, the opening into the\r\nabdomen must be enlarged sufficiently to permit the exit of the extra\r\nbulk.\r\n\r\nIf through inadvertence the operation has been begun while the animal is\r\nin a state of pregnancy, the proceeding must be discontinued, the\r\npatient kept quiet and the matter indefinitely postponed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.\r\n\r\nGENITAL ORGANS OF THE BITCH.\r\n\r\n1--Ovary. 2--Fold of the broad ligament, displaced to expose the ovary.\r\n3--Internal fold of the same. 4--Broad ligaments. 5--Horn of the uterus.\r\n6--Its body. 7--Rectum. 8--Vagina. 9--Kidney. 10--Bladder.\r\n11--Descending colon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGS.\r\n\r\nThe _male_ is altered by either the process of excision, torsion, or\r\nligature, according to the age and size of the animal.\r\n\r\nIn the _female_, when, as is sometimes supposed, it becomes a preventive\r\nmeasure in respect to hydrophobia--though if it be so, it can only be\r\nfrom the fact that a castrated bitch will usually remain at home while\r\nothers are running abroad in heat, and thus being more exposed to\r\ncontagion--the operation is only justifiable in the case of house dogs,\r\ndomestic pets, in order to obviate the annoyance caused to their owners\r\nby their demonstrations while in heat. In the bitch the broad ligaments\r\nare very long (Fig. 43), extending as far as the hypochondriac region,\r\nwhere they divide into an external layer, which reaches to the last rib,\r\nwhile the other extends to the sub-lumbar region behind the diaphragm.\r\nThe broad ligaments diminish in height as they run forward in such a way\r\nthat the anterior border of the external layer where the ovary is found,\r\nshorter in its median part, gives a certain amount of fixity to the\r\nanterior extremity of the horns which it keeps elevated in each\r\nhypochondriac region; on that account both horns cannot be at one time\r\nbrought through the incision, and it becomes generally necessary in the\r\nbitch to operate on each side.\r\n\r\nThe manipulations are similar to those followed in spaying sows, with\r\nthe exception that the incision is made lower, more forward and nearer\r\nto the last rib.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF FOWLS.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this operation upon the quality of the flesh and the\r\npower of accumulating fat, in the domestic fowl is a fact too familiar\r\nto those who have learned to appreciate the exquisite juicy quality of\r\nthe meat of the capon to need any comment at our hands. The operation\r\nupon these animals is one of considerable difficulty and requires skill\r\nand experience to perform with nicety and success.\r\n\r\nIn birds the testicles are situated in the abdominal cavity, immediately\r\nbehind the lungs, under the vertebral column and in front of the kidneys\r\n(Fig. 44). They correspond exactly to the articulation of the last three\r\nribs with the spinal column, where they lie close together and in\r\ncontact with the blood vessels which separate them from the kidneys.\r\nThey are held in position by the peritoneum spread above them, and by\r\nminute blood vessels, branches of the aorta or of the vena cava.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.\r\n\r\nGENITAL ORGAN OF THE ROOSTER.\r\n\r\n1.--Testicle. 2a, 2d.--Deferent canals. 3.--Ureters. 4.--Cloacum.\r\n5.--Posterior aorta. 7.--Posterior vena cava. 8, 9, 10.--Three last\r\nribs. 11.--Pelvic bones.]\r\n\r\nIn the operation the fowl is placed on his side, the tail being towards\r\nthe operator, with the hind leg carried backwards, in order to expose\r\nthe flank of the side selected for the incision. The first step of the\r\noperation consists in plucking the feathers from a sufficient extent of\r\nsurface, and making an incision a little behind the lateral internal\r\nprocesses of the sternum, from within outwards, and from before\r\nbackwards, and slightly oblique, through the skin and the thin muscles\r\nof the abdomen, and when reaching the peritoneum carefully opening it\r\nwith a puncture, having it raised with a pair of forceps. The second\r\nstep, or that which involves the extirpation of the gland, is performed\r\nby the introduction of the index finger of the right hand into the\r\nabdomen, passing it above the intestinal mass and turning towards the\r\ndorsal region near the articulation of the last two ribs, where the\r\ntesticles are felt, prominent at the sub-lumbar region. Then, with the\r\nfingers half flexed, the adhesions of the organ are broken off, and the\r\norgan, held in the bend of the finger, is brought outside. The second\r\ntesticle is removed by the same process. If the testicles should slip\r\nfrom the grasp of the finger, the accident is of little account, as they\r\nwill graft themselves upon the walls of the abdomen, and in time\r\ndisappear by resolution. The operation is concluded by the closing of\r\nthe wound by stitches of interrupted suture, and the healing usually\r\ntakes place by first intention.\r\n\r\nThe operation is performed in the hen in the same manner as with the\r\nmale bird, the ovaries being found in the lumbar region, from which they\r\nare removed by the same manipulations that are employed in caponing.\r\n\r\nYoung fowls about in their third month, are usually selected as the\r\nvictims of this epicurean barbarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abdominal Cryptorchidy                                              77\r\n  Abscesses in Scrotal region                                         89\r\n  Abscesses in Pelvic cavity                                         130\r\n  Advantages of Castration in cows                                   108\r\n  Age at which Castration ought to be performed                        8\r\n  Amaurosis                                                          103\r\n  Anatomy of the male parts                                           15\r\n  Anatomy of the female parts                                        109\r\n\r\n  Bistournage                                                         58\r\n  Bistoury Caché                                                     117\r\n\r\n  Castration of Cryptorchids                                          67\r\n  Castration of Dogs                                                 136\r\n  Castration of Fashion and convenience                                5\r\n  Castration of Females                                              106\r\n  Castration of Fowls                                                139\r\n  Castration of Necessity                                              4\r\n  Castration of Small ruminants                                      131\r\n  Castration of Swine                                                132\r\n  Champignon                                                          90\r\n  Champignon, Superficial                                             92\r\n  Champignon, Deep                                                    93\r\n  Charlier’s Instruments                                        115, 116\r\n  Charlier’s Method                                                  115\r\n  Charlier’s Scissors                                                118\r\n  Clamps                                                          41, 42\r\n  Clamps, House                                                       35\r\n  Classification of Methods                                           19\r\n  Colics                                                              85\r\n  Combined Forceps of M.
