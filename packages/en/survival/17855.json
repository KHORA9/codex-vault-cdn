It also should be of interest to scientific\r\ninvestigators and chemists.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE PRODUCTION AND HANDLING OF HEMP HURDS.=\r\n\r\nBy LYSTER H. DEWEY, _Botanist in Charge of Fiber-Plant Investigations_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WHAT HEMP HURDS ARE.=\r\n\r\nThe woody inner portion of the hemp stalk, broken into pieces and\r\nseparated from the fiber in the processes of breaking and scutching, is\r\ncalled hemp hurds. These hurds correspond to shives in flax, but are\r\nmuch coarser and are usually softer in texture.\r\n\r\nThe hemp stalk grown in a broadcast crop for fiber production is from\r\none-eighth to three-eighths of an inch in diameter and from 4 to 10 feet\r\ntall. The stalk is hollow, with a cylindrical woody shell, thick near\r\nthe base, where the stalk is nearly solid, and thinner above, where the\r\nhollow is relatively wider.\r\n\r\nIn the process of breaking, the woody cylinder inside of the\r\nfiber-bearing bark is broken into pieces one-half of an inch to 3 inches\r\nlong and usually split into numerous segments. The thicker lower\r\nsections are split less than the thin-shelled upper ones, and they are\r\noften left quite solid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PITH, WOOD, AND FIBER.=\r\n\r\nThe inner surface of the hurds usually bears a layer of pith, consisting\r\nof thin-walled cells nearly spherical or angular, but not elongated.\r\nThey are more or less crushed and torn. They are probably of little\r\nvalue for paper, but they constitute less than 1 per cent of the weight\r\nof the hurds. The principal weight and bulk consist of slender elongated\r\nwoody cells. The outer surface is covered with fine secondary fibers\r\ncomposed of slender elongated cells, tougher than those of the wood but\r\nfiner and shorter than those of the hemp fiber of commerce. No method\r\nhas been devised thus far which completely separates from the hurds all\r\nof the long fiber. From 5 to 15 per cent of the weight of the hurds\r\nconsists of hemp fiber, in strands from 3 inches to 8 feet in length.\r\nSome fragments of the bark, made up of short cubical cells, usually dark\r\nin color, cling to the strands of fiber.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CHARACTER OF HURDS AFFECTED BY RETTING.=\r\n\r\nNearly all of the hemp in the United States is dew retted. The stalks\r\nare spread on the ground in swaths as grain is laid by the cradle. The\r\naction of the weather, dew, and rain, aided by bacteria, dissolves and\r\nwashes out the green coloring matter (chlorophyll) and most of the gums,\r\nleaving only the fibrous bark and the wood. The plants in this process\r\nlose about 60 per cent of their green weight, or about 40 per cent of\r\ntheir air-dry weight.\r\n\r\nThe stalks are sometimes set up in shocks to cure before retting, and\r\nafter retting they are set up in shocks to dry. Each time the stalks are\r\nhandled they are chucked down on the ground to keep the butts even. In\r\nthese operations sand and clay are often driven up into the hollow at\r\nthe base of the stalks, and this dirt, which often clings tenaciously,\r\nmay constitute all objectionable feature in the use of hemp hurds for\r\npaper stock.\r\n\r\nIn Italy and in most localities in Russia and Austria-Hungary where hemp\r\nis extensively cultivated, it is retted in water, but water retting has\r\nnever been practiced in the United States except to a limited extent\r\nbefore the middle of the last century. Hurds from water-retted hemp are\r\ncleaner and softer than those from dew-retted hemp.\r\n\r\nThe fiber is sometimes broken from dry hemp stalks without retting. The\r\nhurds thus produced contain a small percentage of soluble gums, chiefly\r\nof the pectose series. Comparatively little hemp is prepared in this\r\nmanner in America.\r\n\r\nProcess retting by means of weak solutions of chemicals or oils in hot\r\nwater is practiced to a limited extent. The hurds from these processes\r\nmay contain traces of the chemicals or oils and also soluble gums in\r\ngreater degree than those of the dew-retted or water-retted hemp.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PROPORTION OF HURDS TO FIBER AND YIELD PER ACRE.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Hemp-breaking machine. The stalks are fed\r\nsidewise in a continuous layer 2 to 3 inches thick, turning out about\r\n4,000 pounds of clean fiber per day and five times as much hurds.]\r\n\r\nThe yield of hemp fiber varies from 400 to 2,500 pounds per acre,\r\naveraging 1,000 pounds under favorable conditions. The weight of hurds\r\nis about five times that of the fiber, or somewhat greater from hemp\r\ngrown on peaty soils. A yield of 2-1/2 tons of hurds per acre may be taken\r\nas a fair average.\r\n\r\n\r\n=HURDS AVAILABLE FROM MACHINE-BROKEN HEMP.=\r\n\r\nHemp hurds are available only from hemp which is broken by machines,\r\nwhen the hurds may be collected in quantity in one place (figs. 1 and\r\n2). Most of the hemp in Kentucky is still broken by hand brakes. These\r\nsmall brakes are moved from shock to shock, so that the hurds are\r\nscattered all over the field in small piles of less than 50 pounds each,\r\nand it is the common practice to set fire to them as soon as the brake\r\nis moved. It would be difficult to collect them at a cost which would\r\npermit their use for paper stock.\r\n\r\nWhere machine brakes are used, the hemp stalks are brought to the\r\nmachine as grain is brought to a thrashing machine, and the hurds\r\naccumulate in large piles, being blown from the machine by wind\r\nstackers.\r\n\r\nMachine brakes are used in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and California, but\r\nto only a limited extent in Kentucky. Five different kinds of machine\r\nbrakes are now in actual use in this country, and still others are used\r\nin Europe. All of the best hemp in Italy, commanding the highest market\r\nprice paid for any hemp, is broken by machines. The better machine\r\nbrakes now in use in this country prepare the fiber better and much more\r\nrapidly than the hand brakes, and they will undoubtedly be used in all\r\nlocalities where hemp raising is introduced as a new industry. They may\r\nalso be used in Kentucky when their cost is reduced to more reasonable\r\nrates, so that they may compete with the hand brake. Hemp-breaking\r\nmachines are being improved and their use is increasing. The\r\nhemp-growing industry can increase in this country only as machine\r\nbrakes are developed to prepare the fiber. A profitable use for the\r\nhurds will add an incentive to the use of the machine brake.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Machine brake and hemp hurds. Hemp hurds from\r\nmachine brakes quickly accumulate in large piles.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=PRESENT USES OF HEMP HURDS.=\r\n\r\nHemp hurds are used to a limited extent for barnyard litter and stable\r\nbedding, as a substitute for sawdust in packing ice, and, in rare\r\ninstances, for fuel. They are not regarded as having a commercial value\r\nfor any of these uses, though they are doubtless worth at least $1 per\r\nton on the farm when used for stable bedding. They are a waste product,\r\nwithout value for other purposes which might compete with their use for\r\npaper stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PRESENT SUPPLIES OF HURDS AVAILABLE.=\r\n\r\nDuring the last season, 1915, about 1,500 acres of hemp have been\r\nharvested outside of Kentucky and in regions where machine brakes are\r\nused. Estimating the yield of hurds at 2-1/2 tons per acre, this should\r\ngive a total quantity of about 3,750 tons. Large quantities of hemp from\r\nthe crop of 1914, which are still unbroken in these areas, and large\r\npiles of hurds undisturbed where the machines have been used during the\r\nlast two or three years, increase the total to more than 7,000 tons.\r\nHemp is now grown outside of Kentucky in the vicinity of McGuffey, east\r\nof Lima, Ohio; around Nappanee, Elkhart County, and near Pierceton, in\r\nKosciusko County, Ind.; about Waupun and Brandon, Wis.; and at Rio Vista\r\nand Stockton, Cal.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, hemp is grown in most of the counties within a radius of 50\r\nmiles of Lexington. No accurate statistics of the acreage are collected,\r\nbut the crop harvested in 1915 is estimated at 7,000 acres. A machine\r\nbrake will probably be used in Bourbon County and also in Clark County,\r\nbut most of the hemp in Kentucky will be broken on hand brakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BALING FOR SHIPMENT.=\r\n\r\nThe hurds will have to be baled to facilitate handling in transportation\r\nand to economize storage space at the paper mills. The bales will need\r\nto be covered with burlap or some material to keep them from shaking\r\nout. They may be baled in the same presses that are used for baling hemp\r\nfiber, but care must be exercised to avoid breaking the press, for the\r\nhurds are more resistant than hemp fiber. A bale of hemp 2 by 3 by 4\r\nfeet weighs about 500 pounds. A bale of hurds of the same size will\r\nweigh about one-third less, or approximately six bales per ton.\r\n\r\nRough hemp fiber as it is shipped from the farm is not covered;\r\ntherefore, the covering material must be purchased especially for the\r\nhurds. A piece of burlap about 36 by 48 inches placed on either side of\r\nthe bale will be sufficient, but these pieces, weighing about 3 pounds\r\neach, cost about 40 cents a pair. Baling rope, in addition to jute\r\ncovering, will cost at least 5 cents per bale, making the total cost of\r\ncovering and ties $2.70 or more per ton. Possibly chip-board, costing\r\nabout $33 per ton, or not more than 5 cents for the two pieces for each\r\nbale, may be used in place of burlap. Chip-board, burlap, and also rope\r\nties may all be used for paper stock. Burlap covers might be returned,\r\nto be used repeatedly until worn out, but chip-board could not be used\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COST OF BALING.=\r\n\r\nIf burlap covers are used the cost of baling, including covering, ties,\r\nuse of baling press, power, and labor will amount to at least 60 cents\r\nper bale, or about $3.75 per ton. If chip-board can be used the cost may\r\nbe reduced to about $2 per ton. The cost of hauling and loading on the\r\ncars will vary from $1 to $3 per ton, depending upon the distance and\r\nthe roads. The farmer must therefore receive from $4 to $6 per ton for\r\nthe hurds, baled, on board cars at his home station.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SUMMARY.=\r\n\r\nHemp hurds are the woody inner portion of the hemp stalk, broken into\r\npieces in removing the fiber.\r\n\r\nThey are not used at present for any purpose that would compete with\r\ntheir use for paper.\r\n\r\nHurds are available only from machine-broken hemp, for the cost of\r\ncollecting them from the hand brakes would be too great.\r\n\r\nAbout 7,000 tons are now available in restricted localities in Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Wisconsin, and California.\r\n\r\nThe quantity is likely to increase as the use of machine brakes\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\nThe hurds may be baled in hemp-fiber presses, with partial burlap covers\r\nlike those on cotton bales, or possibly chip-board covers.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the farmers may deliver the bales on board cars\r\nprofitably at $4 to $6 per ton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER FROM HEMP HURDS.\r\n\r\nBy JASON L. MERRILL, _Paper-Plant Chemist, Paper-Plant Investigations_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=INTRODUCTION.=\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this paper is to report upon preliminary tests which were\r\nconducted to determine the paper-making value of hemp hurds, a crop\r\nwaste of the hemp-fiber industry.\r\n\r\nThe search for plant materials capable of being utilized in paper\r\nmanufacture is a comparatively recent but world-wide activity which has\r\nfor its object the husbanding of present sources of paper-stock supply\r\nby the substitution of new materials for some of those which are rapidly\r\nbecoming less plentiful and more costly.\r\n\r\nThe abstract idea of utilizing that which is at present a waste can play\r\nno important rôle in such activities, the successful commercial outcome\r\nof which must be based on the three fundamental factors--market or\r\ndemand for product, satisfactory raw material, and cost.\r\n\r\nSince hemp hurds are to be treated in this report as a raw material for\r\nthe manufacture of book and printing papers, the qualities, supply,\r\nprobable future, and cost of the material will be considered in\r\ncomparison with wood, with which it must compete. There seems to be\r\nlittle doubt that the present wood supply can not withstand indefinitely\r\nthe demands placed upon it, and with increased scarcity economy in the\r\nuse of wood will become imperative. This effect is already apparent in\r\nmany wood-using industries, and although the paper industry consumes\r\nonly about 3 per cent of the total forest cut, it is probable that it\r\nwill be affected through this economy. Our forests are being cut three\r\ntimes as fast as they grow, and as wood becomes more expensive proper\r\ngrowing and reforesting will receive more attention. Thus, naturally, a\r\nbalance will be established between production and consumption, but as\r\nthis condition approaches its limiting values the price of wood may rise\r\nto such levels that there will be a demand for other raw materials.\r\n\r\nThe use of waste paper in conjunction with chemical wood pulp has\r\nincreased to enormous proportions, and it is probable that the increase\r\nwill continue. Although it is a cheaper raw material than wood, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that as the wood supply decreases and the price of\r\nwood pulp advances, the price of waste paper will advance somewhat\r\nproportionately.\r\n\r\nIn view of these conditions it is advisable to investigate the\r\npaper-making value of the more promising plant materials before a\r\ncritical situation arises. To be of substantial value the investigations\r\nshould include not only a determination of the quality and quantity of\r\npulp and paper which the material is capable of producing, but should\r\nembrace a consideration of such relevant factors as agricultural\r\nconditions, farm practice, assembling conditions, transportation, and\r\nprobable future supply.\r\n\r\nCertain cultivated plants seem particularly promising, because in the\r\nharvesting of the regular crop that portion which might be utilized for\r\npaper manufacture necessarily is either wholly or partially assembled.\r\nTo this class of plants belong corn, broom corn, sorghum, sugar cane,\r\nbagasse, flax, hemp, and the cereal straws.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For descriptions of investigations of some of these crops,\r\nsee the list of publications at the end of this bulletin.]\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that the employment of different raw materials\r\nwould probably yield products of a somewhat different quality than those\r\nnow prevailing in the markets, but the qualities of papers and the\r\npublic demands are so diversified and numerous that this possible\r\nobjection should not be serious. Ten years ago sulphite manufacturers\r\nwould not accept consignments of spruce logs if they contained over 5\r\nper cent of fir, while to-day many manufacturers tolerate 50 per cent.\r\nRope papers are found to contain not only jute, but when this raw\r\nmaterial is not plentiful, chemical pulp of various kinds. \"Linen paper\"\r\nis often no more than a trade term. Not long ago printing papers were\r\nmade entirely from chemical wood pulp, but to-day if it is desired to\r\nsecure paper which is free from ground wood the specifications must so\r\nstipulate. Writing papers, formerly made entirely from rags, now are\r\nlikely to contain either chemical or even ground-wood pulp unless the\r\nspecifications prohibit it. Without doubt, many paper manufacturers have\r\nmaintained certain papers up to a fixed standard for a long series of\r\nyears, but it is equally true that competition has lowered the standard\r\nof a great many papers, some of which had acquired a distinctive\r\nrecognition. The employment of plant fibers will not necessarily lower\r\nthe present quality of papers, but if their employment does result in\r\nproducts whose qualities are somewhat different from our so-called\r\nstandard papers it does not necessarily follow that such papers will not\r\nfind a ready market.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FACTORS JUSTIFYING AN INVESTIGATION OF HEMP HURDS.=\r\n\r\nHemp hurds form a crop waste, in that they necessarily are produced in\r\nthe raising and preparation of hemp fiber, and their present use and\r\nvalue are comparatively insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe assembling of the hurds may be effected with economy, since the area\r\nin which hemp is handled with the use of machine brakes is restricted.\r\nAlthough it must be stated that the present annual supply would not be\r\nsufficient to justify the installation of a pulp mill nor would its\r\ntransportation to existing mills appear feasible, it is expected that\r\nthe available annual tonnage, especially in certain general sections,\r\nwill increase, due to the increased use of the machine brake. The\r\npresent tonnage per annum is approximately as follows: In the region of\r\nOhio and Indiana, 2,500 tons; in the Wisconsin section, 1,000 tons; in\r\nthe California region, 1,400 tons.\r\n\r\nIn years of adverse weather conditions there are often large areas of\r\nhemp which are not harvested on account of its poor quality; there are\r\nalso large areas of cut hemp which become overretted, due to inclement\r\nweather. It has been suggested by some of the hemp raisers that this\r\nlarge amount of material might be utilized as a paper stock. In these\r\ncases the cost of the whole material would probably be somewhat higher\r\nthan that of the hurds, because either all or part of the cost of\r\nharvesting and the total cost of breaking would have to be borne by the\r\npaper maker. Moreover, the quality of this material would be so very\r\nirregular and the supply so uncertain that it probably would not appeal\r\nto the paper manufacturer.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, hemp will continue to be one of the staple agricultural\r\ncrops of the United States. The wholesale destruction of the supply by\r\nfire, as frequently happens in the case of wood, is precluded by the\r\nvery nature of the hemp-raising industry. Since only one year's growth\r\ncan be harvested annually the supply is not endangered by the pernicious\r\npractice of overcropping, which has contributed so much to the present\r\nhigh and increasing cost of pulp wood. The permanency of the supply of\r\nhemp hurds thus seems assured.\r\n\r\nThe favorable location geographically of the hemp regions in relation to\r\nthe pulp and paper industry is a factor of considerable importance. The\r\nKentucky region is not at present in a position to supply hurds, as\r\nmachine methods have not been adopted there to any appreciable degree.\r\nThe Ohio and Indiana region, which at present has the greatest annual\r\ntonnage, with the prospect of an increase, is situated south of the\r\nWisconsin and Michigan wood-pulp producing region and at a distance from\r\nthe eastern wood-pulp producing regions; therefore, it is in a favorable\r\nposition to compete in the large Ohio and Indiana markets. Since, as\r\nwill be shown, the hurd pulp acts far more like soda poplar stock than\r\nsulphite stock, competition would be strongest from the eastern mills;\r\nin fact, the hurd stock might very possibly meet with favor as a\r\nbook-stock furnish in the Michigan and Wisconsin paper mills, which are\r\nwithin the sulphite fiber-producing region. Because of its very close\r\nproximity to paper mills, this latter possibility applies with far\r\ngreater force to the Wisconsin hemp region, where a considerable\r\nextension of the hemp industry is anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--A representative sample of hemp hurds, natural\r\nsize, showing hemp fiber and pieces of wood tissue.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=CHARACTER OF THE MATERIAL.=\r\n\r\nAs received from Pierceton, Ind., the hurds consisted of a mixture of\r\ntangled hemp bast fibers and pieces of broken wood of the hemp stalk.\r\n(Fig. 3.) No reliable data were secured as to the proportion of bast\r\nfiber in the total shipment of 4 tons, although two hand separations of\r\nsmall representative samples gave results averaging 8 per cent. The\r\nchemical character of the material was such and the quantity was so\r\nsmall that any appreciable variation of the proportion should not affect\r\nmaterially the treating processes finally adopted, yet its presence in\r\nvarying proportions undoubtedly would modify to some extent the quality\r\nof the resulting paper product. Since the length of the ultimate bast\r\nfiber averages about 22 mm. and the length of the ultimate hemp wood\r\nfiber averages 0.7 mm., it is natural to assume that the bast fiber\r\nwould tend to increase the strength of paper produced from the hurds.\r\n(Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Fiber derived from the woody portion of the\r\nhurds. ×75. From a microphotograph.]\r\n\r\nThe broken pieces of wood contained in the hurds varied in length from\r\nmere particles which were somewhat finer than sawdust to pieces about\r\n3-1/2 inches long, exceptional pieces being found which measured 6\r\ninches in length. The majority of the long pieces were between 2 and 3\r\ninches in length. In thickness the pieces ranged from one-eighth of an\r\ninch, in case they were derived from the base of the hemp stalks, to\r\nabout one sixty-fourth of an inch in those pieces which were derived\r\nfrom the top and branches of the stalks. In cross section the pieces\r\noften were found to be a quarter or half of the rounded rectangular\r\nwoody shell of the stalk, although there appeared to be no regularity in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nFrom the pulp-maker's standpoint the great irregularity in thickness,\r\nlength, and mass of the woody pieces militates decidedly against economy\r\nin pulp production. The smaller pieces reduce by chemical treatment\r\nsooner than the larger fragments and are thereby overtreated, which\r\nresults in a lower yield of cellulose fiber and a product composed of\r\nundertreated and overtreated fibers, the production and use of which are\r\nnot satisfactory or economical. It probably would be found more\r\nsatisfactory, therefore, to screen or sort the hurds and treat the\r\nvarious sizes separately and differently.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the hurds was a small quantity of chaff and dirt,\r\ncomposed chiefly of sand, soil, particles of hemp leaves and flowers,\r\nand other extraneous matter. The sand and soil were present because of\r\nthe practice of placing the stalks in shocks in the field, the butts of\r\nthe stalks being in contact with the soil. It is a simple matter,\r\nhowever, to remove the chaff and dirt by sieving, and this practice was\r\nfollowed in most of the paper tests conducted with this material.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CHARACTER OF THE TESTS.=\r\n\r\nBecause of the similarity of hemp hurds to other materials which have\r\nbeen tested by the Office of Paper-Plant Investigations, semicommercial\r\ntests were conducted in cooperation with a paper manufacturer without\r\npreliminary laboratory tests. Laboratory pulp and paper tests are\r\nregarded only as a preliminary to semicommercial tests and therefore are\r\nnot employed unless the material in question presents new features which\r\nshould receive investigation before larger sized tests are undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of cooperative mill tests are many, among which may be\r\nmentioned the counsel and advice of the mill management and employees,\r\nthe services of specialized and skilled labor, facilities for comparing\r\nthe processes and the results of tests with commercial processes and\r\nresults, and the use of commercial or semicommercial types and sizes of\r\nmachinery. Tests conducted in this manner and on this scale are of a\r\ndifferent quality than is possible in those conducted in a laboratory,\r\nand the results are susceptible of commercial interpretation with a fair\r\ndegree of reliability. It is found, in general, that the cost of\r\nsecuring such equipment and service for a complete and comprehensive\r\ntest does not exceed $500, while the installation of an equally\r\nsatisfactory equipment alone would cost at least $50,000 and in many\r\ncases very much more. Tests conducted in this manner constitute a direct\r\ndemonstration to the manufacturer, and the results obtained are found to\r\ncarry more weight when presented to other manufacturers for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the method of conducting tests necessarily varies\r\nwith the size of the test. In the matter of yield determination, for\r\nexample, laboratory tests may be on such a small scale that the weighing\r\nand sampling of the resulting cellulose fibers may be conducted by means\r\nof chemical laboratory apparatus and analytical balance, while in tests\r\ninvolving a matter of 5 to 10 pounds of material larger and different\r\ntypes of equipment are necessary. When the tests are so increased in\r\nsize as to employ 300 or 400 pounds, still other types of equipment are\r\nnecessary for the treatment of the material and for a determination of\r\nthe yield of fiber. In tests involving tons of material the equipment\r\ninvolves the use of machines. Accuracy in degree of control and in\r\nresults will vary materially with the size of the test. As the size of\r\nthe test increases, certain factors will vary in a beneficial manner,\r\nwhile others will vary in a detrimental manner, so it is a question for\r\neach investigator to decide, after taking all factors into\r\nconsideration, as to the size of test which will give the most\r\nsatisfactory results. In work of this nature it is found, on the whole,\r\nthat better results are obtained in large tests, although the control of\r\nthe factors and the determination of the yield of fiber are more\r\ndifficult than in smaller tests.\r\n\r\nIn the tests described in this bulletin, the Department of Agriculture\r\nemployed a rotary digester of its own design,[2] comprising a shell 5\r\nfeet 5 inches in length by 4 feet in diameter, capable of holding about\r\n300 pounds of air-dry hurds. It is believed that a test of this size is\r\nlarge enough to give satisfactory results and that the results are\r\nsusceptible of commercial interpretation, while at the same time they\r\nare sufficiently small for complete control and to afford fiber-yield\r\nfigures which are both accurate and reliable. Two such rotary charges\r\ngave enough fiber for one complete paper-making test.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For a description of this rotary digester, see Brand, C.\r\nJ., and Merrill, J. L., Zacaton as a paper-making material, U. S. Dept.\r\nAgr. Bul. 309, p. 28, 1915.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=OPERATIONS INVOLVED IN A TEST.=\r\n\r\nA complete test on hurds comprises seven distinct operations, and the\r\nmethod will be described, operation by operation, in the order in which\r\nthey were conducted.\r\n\r\n_Sieving._--The hurds for the first test were not sieved to remove sand\r\nand dirt, but the resulting paper was so dirty that sieving was\r\npracticed in all subsequent tests. The hurds were raked along a\r\nhorizontal galvanized-iron screen, 15 feet long and 3 feet wide, with\r\n11-1/2 meshes per linear inch, the screen being agitated by hand from\r\nbelow. Various amounts of dirt and chaff could be removed, depending on\r\nthe degree of action, but it was found that if much more than 3 per cent\r\nof the material was removed it consisted chiefly of fine pieces of wood\r\nwith practically no additional sand or dirt; in most of the tests,\r\ntherefore, the material was screened so as to remove approximately 3 per\r\ncent. It became apparent that a finer screen would probably serve as\r\nwell and effect a saving of small but good hurds.\r\n\r\n_Cooking._--Cooking is the technical term for the operation by which\r\nfibrous raw materials are reduced to a residue of cellulose pulp by\r\nmeans of chemical treatment. In these tests about 300 pounds of hurds\r\nwere charged into the rotary with the addition of a caustic-soda\r\nsolution, such as is regularly employed in pulp mills and which tested\r\nan average of 109.5 grams of caustic soda per liter, or 0.916 pound per\r\ngallon, and averaged 85 per cent causticity. Sufficient caustic solution\r\nwas added to furnish 25 or 30 per cent of actual caustic soda,\r\ncalculated on the bone-dry weight of hurds in the charge. After closing\r\nthe rotary head, it was started rotating at the rate of one-half\r\nrevolution per minute, and in about five minutes steam at 120 pounds per\r\nsquare inch was admitted at such a rate that the charge was heated in\r\none hour to 170° C., which is the theoretical equivalent of 100 pounds\r\nof steam pressure per square inch. It was found, however, that when the\r\ntemperature reached 170° C. the pressure was usually 115 or 120 pounds\r\ninstead of 100 pounds, due to air and gases inclosed in the rotary. At\r\nthis point the rotary was stopped and steam and air relieved until the\r\npressure dropped to 100 pounds, or a solid steam pressure. The\r\ntemperature was maintained at this point for the number of hours\r\nrequired to reduce the hurds, which was found to be about five, after\r\nwhich the rotary was stopped and steam relieved until the pressure was\r\nreduced to zero, when the head was removed and the stock was emptied\r\ninto a tank underneath, measuring 5-1/2 by 6 by 2 feet deep, where it\r\nwas drained and washed. Samples of waste soda solution or \"black\r\nliquor,\" which were taken from some of the \"cooks\" for analysis, were\r\ndrawn while the stock was being thus emptied into the drainer.\r\n\r\n_Determination of yield._--For determining the yield of cellulose fiber\r\nthe stock in the drain tank was washed with water until free from waste\r\nsoda solution, when, by means of a vacuum pump communicating with the\r\nspace between the bottom and the false perforated bottom, the water was\r\nsucked from the stock, leaving the fiber with a very uniform moisture\r\ncontent throughout its entire mass and in a condition suitable for\r\nremoving, sampling, and weighing for a yield determination. Tests have\r\nshown that it is possible to sample and calculate the yield of bone-dry\r\nfiber within 0.05 per cent of the actual amount.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that stocks from different materials vary greatly in\r\ntheir ability to mat in the drain tank, thereby enabling a good vacuum\r\nto be obtained, some stocks permitting a 25-inch vacuum to be obtained,\r\nwhile others will not permit more than 5 inches. For this reason the\r\nmoisture content of the stock will vary from 65 to 85 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Washing and bleaching._--Washing and bleaching were performed for the\r\npurpose of bleaching the brown-colored cooked stock to a white product,\r\nsince it was regarded as highly probable that the fiber would be\r\nsuitable for book-paper manufacture. The colored stock was charged into\r\na 400-pound beating and washing engine of regular construction and\r\nwashed about one hour, the cylinder washer being covered with 60-mesh\r\nwire cloth in order to remove fine loose dirt and chemical residues. The\r\nwasher was then raised, the stock heated by steam to about 40° C., and a\r\nsolution of commercial bleaching powder was added in the quantity judged\r\nto be necessary, after which the stock was pumped to a large wooden\r\ntank, to remain and bleach over night. If the stock was bleached\r\nsufficiently white it was drained and washed from bleach residues, and\r\nif not more bleach was added until a good color was obtained. The\r\nbleaching powder used was estimated to contain 35 per cent of available\r\nchlorin, as this is the commercial practice, and the amount required was\r\ncalculated to the bone-dry weight of the unbleached stock. More bleach\r\nis required for undercooked stock than for stock which is properly\r\ncooked or overcooked; therefore, the percentage of bleach required is an\r\nindication of the quality of the cooked stock. Since bleaching is\r\nusually more expensive than cooking, it is desirable to cook to such a\r\ndegree that the consumption of bleach will be held within certain\r\nlimits, depending on the raw materials used and the quality of paper to\r\nbe produced. In these tests it was desirable so to cook the hurds that\r\nthe consumption of bleach would not be over about 10 per cent of the\r\nfiber.\r\n\r\n_Furnishing._--Furnishing is the operation of charging the beating\r\nengine with the desired kind or kinds of fiber in the proper proportion\r\nand amount and the adding of such loading and sizing agents as may be\r\nnecessary. As shown in the record of results, the furnish in these tests\r\nconsisted of hurd stock alone and of various proportions of hurds,\r\nsulphite fiber, and soda fiber. The percentages to be given in the\r\nrecord of the furnishes refer to the percentage of the total fiber\r\nfurnish, and this likewise applies to the loading and sizing agents. In\r\ncase sulphite or soda fiber was used, the commercial product in the dry\r\nstate was charged into the beating engine and disintegrated, after which\r\nthe hurd stock was added in the wet condition.\r\n\r\n_Beating._--Beating is that operation concerning which the paper makers\r\noften say \"there is where the paper is really made,\" and although the\r\nstatement may not be literally true it contains a great deal of truth.\r\nIt is the operation whereby the fibers are separated from each other,\r\nreduced to the proper lengths, and put in such a physical or chemical\r\ncondition that they felt properly and form into a satisfactory sheet. It\r\nis probable that the quality of the sheet depends more upon the proper\r\nbeater action than upon any other single operation. The action consists\r\nin drawing a water suspension of the fiber between two sets of rather\r\nblunt knives, one set being located in the bottom of a circulating\r\ntrough and the other set on the periphery of a roll revolving just above\r\nthe former set of knives. It is during this operation that the loading\r\nand sizing agents are incorporated and the whole furnish is tinted\r\neither to produce a satisfactory white or the desired color.\r\n\r\nThe term \"paper making,\" as used in this publication, means the\r\noperation of forming the finished sheet of paper from stock which has\r\nbeen furnished and prepared in the beater. In these tests a 30-inch\r\nFourdrinier machine of regular construction was used, a machine which\r\noften is used for the production of paper for filling regular commercial\r\norders. The machine is designed to cause the water suspension of fibers\r\nto flow on to a traveling wire cloth, whereby the water drains away.\r\nMore water is removed by passing the wet sheet through a series of press\r\nrolls, after which the sheet is dried on steam-heated drums and passed\r\nthrough polished iron rolls, which impart a finish to the sheet. A\r\nJordan refining machine was employed in conjunction with the machine to\r\nimprove further the quality of the fiber, and a pulp screen was used in\r\norder to remove coarse and extraneous materials from the fiber.\r\n\r\n\r\n=DESCRIPTION OF TESTS.=\r\n\r\nThe nature of each complete paper test and the dependence of each\r\noperation on the others were such that it does not seem advisable to\r\nsubmit the results of the seven tests in tabular form. The numerous\r\ncooks, however, which furnished the pulp for the paper tests are\r\npresented in Table I in all essential detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.--Data on cooking hemp hurds.\r\n\r\n------+-----------+------------+----------+--------------------+-----------\r\n      |           |            |          |                    |\r\n      |           |            |          |      Cooking       | Yield of\r\n      |  Caustic  |Strength of |          |                    | bone-dry\r\n      | soda used |caustic soda|Causticity+--------+-----------+   fiber\r\n Cook |(percentage| (grams per |  of soda |        |           |(percentage\r\n  No. |of bone-dry|   liter).  | solution.|  Time  |Temperature|of bone-dry\r\n      |   hurds). |            |          |(hours).|   (°C.)   | unsieved\r\n      |           |            |          |        |           |  hurds).\r\n------+-----------+------------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------\r\n293   |       20.6|       100  |      75.3|       3|        166|\r\n294   |       21  |       100  |      75.3|       3|        166|\r\n295   |       21.6|       100  |      75.3|       3|        166|\r\n296   |       20.3|       100  |      75.3|       3|        166|\r\n301   |       21.9|       100  |      82.5|       4|        166|  [3]\r\n302   |       24.4|       100  |      82.5|       4|        166|\r\n303   |       24.2|       100  |      84.3|       4|        166|     44.1\r\n304   |       25  |       100  |      84.3|       4|        170|     39.5\r\n305   |       25  |       100  |      84.3|       5|        170|     39.4\r\n306   |       27.8|       107.5|      84.3|       4|        166|     36.5\r\n307   |       26.7|       107  |      84.4|       5|        170|     38.1\r\n308   |       26  |       107  |      84.4|       5|        170|\\_   37.3\r\n309   |       27.3|       107  |      84.4|       5|        170|/\r\n310   |       27.1|       107  |      84.4|       6|        170|     37.0\r\n311   |       27.2|       107  |      84.4|       6|        170|     36.8\r\n312   |       28.3|       116.5|      85.5|       5|        170|     35.9\r\n313   |       29.1|       113.1|      84.9|       5|        170|\\_   35.2\r\n314   |       29.1|       109  |      83.9|       5|        170|/\r\n315   |       29.4|       109  |      83.9|       5|        170|     34.9\r\n316   |       30  |       109.5|      84.9|       5|        170|     37.2\r\n317   |       29.6|       109.5|      84.9|       5|        170|     37.0\r\n318   |       29.6|       107  |      84.8|       5|        170|     37.7\r\n319   |       29.4|       107.5|      84.2|       5|        170|\\_   35.4\r\n320   |       29.3|       107.5|      84.2|       5|        170|/\r\n------+-----------+------------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Stock not used; dirty.]\r\n\r\nDiscussion of the various cooks will be given in connection with the\r\ndescriptions of those paper tests in which the stocks from the cooks\r\nwere used, since a stock and its cooking condition can be judged\r\nadequately only after it has been put through the various processes and\r\ninto the finished sheet of paper.\r\n\r\nThe first test consisted in making four separate cooks, Nos. 293, 294,\r\n295, and 296, of approximately 300 pounds each, dividing the total stock\r\ninto two parts and making two separate paper tests. The first test was\r\nmade primarily in order to learn some of the qualities and\r\ncharacteristics of the stock and to get the machinery equipment adjusted\r\nproperly. The yield of fiber was not determined in this preliminary\r\ntest, since the knowledge of it was not essential at this stage of the\r\nwork. The cooked stock which was emptied into the drainer to be washed\r\nfree from black liquor was composed largely of whole pieces of hurds,\r\nbut only slight pressure between the fingers was required to crush the\r\npieces. In the case of wood, this condition ordinarily would indicate\r\nundercooking, but might not in the case of hurds. Further observation on\r\nthe action of the cooked stock during subsequent processes was necessary\r\nin order to judge of its quality or the suitability of the cooking\r\nconditions. The total cooked stock, about 500 pounds, was divided into\r\ntwo portions of 200 and 300 pounds, respectively, and work was continued\r\non them separately. The 200-pound test, designated as run No. 135, was\r\nput into a 350-pound washing engine, washed one hour, and given a total\r\nlight brush of 2-1/4 hours. The washing removed a great amount of dirt,\r\nbut the engine did not reduce the hurd stock as much as was desired.\r\nAfter heating the stock in the beater to 40° C., it was bleached with\r\nbleaching-powder solution, 94 gallons at 0.418 pound bleach per gallon,\r\nequivalent to 19.7 per cent of the fiber. This percentage of bleach is\r\nregarded as too high for stock intended for book-paper manufacture, and\r\nsubsequent cooks therefore were given harder treatment in order to\r\nreduce this figure. After draining and washing free from bleach\r\nresidues, the stock was furnished in the beater with 13 per cent of\r\nclay, 1 per cent of resin size, and 2.5 per cent of alum, was tinted\r\nblue, given one hour's light brush, and pumped to the stock chest. When\r\nrunning it on the paper machine, the Jordan refiner seemed to have\r\nlittle effect in reducing shives of undertreated wood, which indicated\r\nfurther the necessity of harder cooking. The furnish acted well on the\r\npaper machine at 70 feet per minute, but appeared somewhat too \"free\" on\r\nthe wire. The paper produced from this test is of very low quality, due\r\nto the improper preparation of the stock, lack of sufficient bleach, the\r\nuse of too small an amount of blue tinting, and the presence of an\r\nexcessive amount of dirt, sand, and shives. The excessive amount of dirt\r\nand sand suggested the sieving of the hurds before cooking, and this was\r\nperformed in all subsequent cooks.\r\n\r\nThe finish of the sheet is very poor, due to the fact that the calender\r\nstack was composed of very light rolls which did not have a satisfactory\r\nsurface, yet the stack is known to be able to produce better finishes if\r\nthe proper stock is employed.\r\n\r\nRun No. 136 was made on the 300-pound portion of stock from cooks Nos.\r\n293, 294, 295, and 296, and in essentially the same manner as run No.\r\n135. The stock was washed one hour, but given a brush of three hours,\r\nand this brush was harder than in run No. 135. Bleach to the extent of\r\n19.8 per cent of the fiber was used, assisted by 1 pint of oil of\r\nvitriol, and the resulting color was an improvement over that of run No.\r\n135. After adding 13.5 per cent of clay and sizing with 1.1 per cent of\r\nresin size, the furnish was given one-half hour's light brush, tinted,\r\nand run on the machine, which was set at 70 feet per minute. This stock\r\nacted better on the wire and gave no trouble on the machine, but it\r\nstill seemed to be impossible to reduce the wood shives by manipulation\r\nof the Jordan refiner. The resulting sheet is an improvement over that\r\nproduced by No. 135, but is far from satisfactory.\r\n\r\nRun No. 138 was made from hurds which, as in all subsequent tests, were\r\nsieved on a 11-1/2-mesh wire screen until practically all the loose dirt\r\nand sand was removed, which operation caused a loss averaging 3 per cent\r\nof the hurds. Stock from cooks Nos. 302 and 303 was used for this run\r\nand the increased amount of caustic soda and the increase in the time of\r\ncooking gave a stock of better appearance than those of preceding tests.\r\n\r\nThe stock, amounting to 231 pounds dry weight, was washed and at the\r\nsame time given a light brush for one hour only, after which it was\r\nbleached with 17 per cent of bleach without the addition of acid. Since\r\nthe preceding paper appeared somewhat weak and had a low tearing\r\nquality, it was decided to use a furnish of 15.7 per cent bleached\r\nsulphite and 84.3 per cent bleached hemp-hurd stock. After loading with\r\n13.1 per cent of clay and sizing with 1.1 per cent of resin size, the\r\nfurnish was given a medium brush for one hour, tinted, and run on to the\r\nmachine at 70 feet per minute. The stock gave no trouble on the machine,\r\nbut it was impossible to judge the effect of the Jordan refiner, because\r\nthrough an oversight the machine chest had not been cleaned since\r\nprevious use on an unbleached yucca material. It is believed, however,\r\nthat sheet No. 138 shows improvement in the preparation of the hurd\r\npulp.\r\n\r\nRun No. 139 was made from stock of cooks Nos. 304 and 305, in which\r\nstill more caustic soda was employed and the time and temperature of\r\ncooking were increased, giving a yield of total fiber of 40.7 per cent\r\nof the sieved or 39.4 per cent of the unsieved hurds. The cooked stock\r\nstill seemed to be undertreated, but it must be remembered that in\r\nworking with any new raw material it is impossible to know in advance\r\nhow the properly treated material should appear. A washing of one hour\r\nwas given while the roll was lowered from a light to a medium brush,\r\nafter which the stock was bleached with 17.1 per cent of bleach without\r\nthe aid of acid. Since sulphite stock improved the previous paper, this\r\nbleached stock was used in a furnish of 16.6 per cent sulphite and 83.4\r\nper cent hurds, loaded with 16.7 per cent clay, sized with 1.4 per cent\r\nresin size, given a medium brush of two hours, tinted, and run on to the\r\nmachine at 70 feet per minute. The Jordan refiner seemed to have little\r\neffect in reducing shives and was therefore left \"just off.\" No trouble\r\nwas experienced with the stock on the machine, and the sheet is an\r\nimprovement over previous samples.\r\n\r\nRun No. 140 was made from cooks Nos. 306 and 307, in which more caustic\r\nsoda was employed than in any previous cooks and at a higher\r\nconcentration, the fiber yields of which averaged 37.3 per cent of the\r\nunsieved hurds. Not much improvement was apparent in the cooked stock,\r\nin spite of the increased severity of cooking. The stock was washed and\r\ngiven a medium brush for one hour, bleached with 11.9 per cent of\r\nbleach, assisted with one-half pint of oil of vitriol, and made into a\r\nfurnish of 14.9 per cent sulphite and 85.1 per cent of the hurd stock.\r\nAfter loading with 14.7 per cent of clay and sizing with 1.28 per cent\r\nof resin size, the furnish was given two hours' medium brush, tinted,\r\nand run on to the paper machine at 70 feet per minute. Again the Jordan\r\nrefiner did not seem to reduce the wood shives sufficiently, and it was\r\nleft \"just off.\" No trouble which could be attributed to the stock was\r\nexperienced on the paper machine. The color of the resulting paper is\r\ndue to the use of too little blue in tinting and probably in some\r\nmeasure to the use of too low a percentage of bleach.\r\n\r\nRun No. 141 was made from the stock of cooks Nos. 308 and 309 in\r\npractically the same manner as run No. 140. The stock was washed and\r\nbrushed one hour, bleached (the record of the amount of bleach was\r\nlost), made into a furnish of 14.7 per cent of sulphite and 85.3 per\r\ncent of hurd stock, loaded with 14.9 per cent of clay, sized with 1.26\r\nper cent of resin size, given one hour at a medium brush, tinted, and\r\nrun on to the machine. The Jordan refiner was able to reduce the wood\r\nshives to a somewhat greater degree than in previous runs and was held\r\nat a medium brush. The stock acted well on the machine and produced a\r\nsheet of better quality than any preceding, with the exception of the\r\ncolor, which was due to using too small a quantity of blue.\r\n\r\nAmong the cooks made for run No. 142 are Nos. 312 and 313, in which the\r\nconcentration of the caustic soda was raised to 113 and 116 grams per\r\nliter and the percentage employed was also increased. In spite of these\r\nincreases the stock from these two cooks did not show any appreciable\r\nimprovement when dumped from the rotary. Stock from cooks Nos. 310, 311,\r\nand 312 was given a medium brush and washing of one hour, bleached with\r\n10.95 per cent of bleach, made into a furnish consisting of 15.2 per\r\ncent of sulphite and 84.8 per cent of hurd stock, loaded with 15.2 per\r\ncent of clay, sized with 1.28 per cent of resin size, given a medium\r\nbrush for one hour, tinted, and pumped to the stock chest. Stock from\r\ncooks Nos. 313 and 314 was treated in exactly the same manner, except\r\nthat 11.4 per cent of bleach was used. It was pumped to the stock chest\r\nand mixed with the furnished stock from cooks Nos. 310, 311, and 312. A\r\nmedium Jordan brush was given the stock and it acted well on the paper\r\nmachine, which was speeded to 75 feet per minute. There seems to be a\r\ntendency in the hurd stock to crush a little at the \"dandy roll,\" and\r\nalthough the marks are not removed by the calender stack which was\r\nemployed in those tests it was found that one \"nip\" on the\r\nsupercalenders renders them practically imperceptible and it is believed\r\nthat the proper size and weight of calender stack would entirely remove\r\nthese marks. All of the papers produced up to this point are somewhat\r\nlacking in the bulk desired in a book paper; therefore, in the two\r\nfollowing runs soda-poplar stock was included in the furnishes.\r\n\r\nIn run No. 143 stock from cooks Nos. 315 and 316 was given a medium\r\nbrush and washing for one hour and was medium brushed for one hour more,\r\nbleached with 11.3 per cent of bleach assisted with one-half pint of oil\r\nof vitriol, made into a furnish of 16.5 per cent of sulphite, 22.3 per\r\ncent of soda poplar, and 61.2 per cent of hurd stock, loaded with 22 per\r\ncent of clay, sized with 1.38 per cent of resin size, given a hard brush\r\nfor one hour, tinted very strongly, and pumped to the stock chest. This\r\nstock was beaten to a greater extent than in previous runs. The stock\r\nwas run on the paper machine at a speed of 75 feet per minute, using a\r\nmedium Jordan brush, and no trouble whatsoever was experienced. Not over\r\n2 pounds of \"broke\" was produced during the whole run, and that was in\r\nthe \"threading\" of the machine. The color of the sheet is entirely\r\nsatisfactory for many uses. The wood shives apparently were reduced to a\r\nsatisfactory degree. Experienced paper makers commented very favorably\r\non the running of this furnish and the quality of the paper produced.\r\n\r\nRun No. 144 was intended as a duplicate of run No. 143. Stock from cooks\r\nNos. 317 and 318 was given a medium brush and washing for one hour and a\r\nfurther medium brush of one hour, bleached with 11.4 per cent of bleach,\r\nand made into a furnish composed of 15.5 per cent of sulphite, 23.5 per\r\ncent of soda poplar, and 61 per cent of hurd stock, loaded with 21.4 per\r\ncent of clay, sized with 1.17 per cent of resin size, hard brushed for\r\none hour, tinted by the expert colorer of the company, and pumped to the\r\nstock chest. Stock from cooks Nos. 319 and 320 was treated in exactly\r\nthe same manner except that the stock was bleached with 12.1 per cent of\r\nbleach and pumped to the stock chest to mix with the former furnish. The\r\nstock acted very well on the machine, which was speeded to 75 feet per\r\nminute, with the Jordan refiner set at a medium brush. The sheet is as\r\ngood, if not better, than that of run No. 143, and it is also a good\r\nillustration of the extent to which proper tinting will enhance the\r\ngeneral appearance of a paper. The poor appearance of the samples of\r\nprevious runs is due largely to lack of proper tinting. Various degrees\r\nof whiteness, however, are demanded by the trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COMPARISON OF THE TESTS AND COMMERCIAL PRACTICE.=\r\n\r\nIn work of this nature and on this scale it is practically impossible to\r\narrive at a cost figure which would be susceptible of commercial\r\ninterpretation, and in this preliminary publication nothing will be\r\nattempted beyond a comparison of the process used with the hurds with\r\nthat process commercially applied to poplar wood. The process last used\r\nwith the hurds should not be regarded as final, satisfactory, or most\r\nsuitable, as it has been shown that progress was being made up to the\r\nconclusion of the work.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the method of using hurds with the method of handling\r\npoplar wood, a difference is apparent on the delivery of raw material at\r\nthe mill. Ordinarily, poplar is received at the mill in the form of logs\r\nabout 4 feet in length, which may be stored in piles in the open. Hurds\r\nvery likely would be received baled, and it would seem advisable to\r\nstore them under cover for the following reasons: (_a_) Baled hurds\r\nwould probably absorb and retain more water during wet weather than logs\r\nof wood, thereby causing excessive dilution of the caustic liquor; (_b_)\r\nprolonged excessive dampness might create heating and deterioration\r\nunless the hemp were properly retted; (_c_) wet hurds could not be\r\nsieved free from sand and chaff. Should further work show that the first\r\ntwo reasons need not be taken into consideration, the third objection\r\nmight be overcome by sieving the hurds before baling. Even then, it is\r\nprobable that baled hurds stored in the open would accumulate and retain\r\nconsiderable dirt from factory chimneys, locomotives, and wind. Checked\r\npulp wood exposed in the open invariably suffers from these causes.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the raw material for the digesters there is\r\nlikewise considerable difference between hurds and poplar wood. The\r\nformer apparently requires only a moderate sieving to remove sand and\r\nchaff, which operation doubtless would require only a small amount of\r\nlabor and the installation of some simple machinery of low power\r\nconsumption. In preparing poplar for digestion, the 4-foot logs are\r\nchipped by a heavy, comparatively expensive chipper of high power\r\nconsumption, after which the chips are sorted by sieving, the large\r\npieces being rechipped. There would be a noteworthy difference in the\r\ninstallation, operating, and depreciation costs of the two equipments,\r\nand this difference would counterbalance to a considerable extent the\r\ndifference in cost of raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that in the use of the chip loft more care would have to\r\nbe exercised in using hurds because of the tendency of the bast fiber to\r\ncause lodgments, but this should not be considered a serious difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe weight of hurds which are capable of being charged into a rotary is\r\na decidedly unfavorable factor. The weight of a cubic foot of hurds\r\nvaries somewhat with the proportion of bast fiber, but averages about\r\n5.4 pounds, which, compared with a cubic foot of poplar chips at 8.93\r\npounds, represents a digester charge of 60.5 per cent of the weight of\r\na poplar-wood charge, or, in terms of fiber capacity, the hurds charge\r\nwould yield 38.6 per cent as much fiber as the wood charge. The hurds\r\nupon being baled for transportation may be broken and crushed to such a\r\ndegree that the weight of the charge may be increased, and it might be\r\nfound possible to increase the charge weight by steaming or by the\r\nemployment of tamping devices. This small weight of charge constitutes\r\none of the most serious objections to the use of hurds in paper\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nIn those tests in which the most satisfactory results were obtained, the\r\ncooking conditions were 29.5 per cent of caustic soda at a concentration\r\nof 107 grams per liter and a causticity of 84.0 per cent acting at a\r\ntemperature of 170° C. for five hours, or a total time of seven hours.\r\nThe steam condensation in the rotary used for these tests was abnormally\r\nhigh, due to the fact that the steam supply pipe was uncovered for a\r\nconsiderable distance and the rotary was entirely uncovered. It is\r\nbelieved, therefore, that a larger amount of caustic was necessary than\r\nwould otherwise have been the case. This belief is strengthened by the\r\nquality of the waste liquor from one of the later cooks, which gave on\r\nanalysis 16.85 grams per liter of free caustic soda and showed a\r\ncausticity of 27.75 per cent. These data show that only 67.3 per cent of\r\nthe total caustic employed was actually consumed in the cooking\r\noperation, which percentage is lower than obtains in practice. The stock\r\nfrom this cook was bleached with 11.5 per cent of bleach. But even as\r\nthe figures stand, the comparison with poplar cooking practice is as\r\nfollows: 29.5 per cent caustic soda used as against 22 to 25 per cent;\r\n107 grams per liter as against 100 to 110; 84 per cent causticity is\r\nlittle different than obtains in practice; 170° C. is about commercial\r\npractice; five hours at pressure as against four to six hours; seven\r\nhours' total time as against possibly six to eight hours; 11.5 per cent\r\nbleach as against 8 to 10 per cent. Thus, it is evident that the cooking\r\nconditions employed were slightly more severe and expensive than those\r\nin commercial use with poplar wood.\r\n\r\nThe yield of total fiber obtained from the hurds may be placed at 35 per\r\ncent of bone-dry fiber calculated on the bone-dry weight of hurds used,\r\nor 33.1 per cent of air-dry fiber calculated on air-dry hurds. The yield\r\nof bleached fiber was not determined in this preliminary work, but may\r\nbe safely estimated as 30 per cent, which is low when compared with a\r\nyield of about 47 per cent of bone-dry bleached fiber from bone-dry\r\npoplar wood. It is believed quite possible that satisfactory cooking\r\nconditions may be found which will give a higher yield than was obtained\r\nduring these tests. The stock should be classed as easy bleaching, and\r\n11.4 per cent of bleach is a satisfactory figure, although a little\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nAs to beating cost, in the last two and most satisfactory tests the\r\ntotal washing and beating time was three hours, which may be about an\r\nhour more than ordinarily is used in making papers of this grade,\r\nalthough the practice varies to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nIn regard to furnish, there is such a diversity of practice that it is\r\ndifficult to make a comparison, but if the hurd stock can be produced as\r\ncheaply as soda-poplar stock, the furnish used in these last two tests\r\nshould be regarded as satisfactory to the book and printing paper\r\nmanufacturer.\r\n\r\nThe finish of the paper was not all that might be desired, but that was\r\ndue almost entirely to the calender stack available for the work, which\r\nwas composed of nine light rolls, many of which were about 6 inches in\r\ndiameter and which had not been reground for some time. From a small\r\ntest on a large calender stack it was readily shown that the paper\r\nproduced is capable of taking a satisfactory finish.\r\n\r\nThis comparison, satisfactory in many respects, develops two factors\r\nwhich are decidedly unfavorable to hemp hurds, namely, raw-material\r\nstorage and digester capacity, and they must be taken into full account\r\nin considering the paper-making value of this material, although it\r\nshould be recognized that investigation may result in the material\r\nimprovement of these conditions. Moreover, it is not at all improbable\r\nthat further investigation would develop more satisfactory treating\r\nconditions and more suitable furnish compositions, and the belief in\r\nthis possibility is strengthened by the fact that material progress was\r\nbeing made at the conclusion of this preliminary work.\r\n\r\nCalculations on the raw material and acreage for a permanent supply for\r\na pulp mill producing 25 tons of fiber a day for 300 days per annum, or\r\n7,500 tons per annum, give the comparison between hurds and wood shown\r\nin Table II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.--_Comparison between wood and hemp hurds._\r\n\r\n-----------+-------------+--------------+-----------+--------------------\r\n           |             |              |           | Acres required for\r\n           |             |              |           | sustained supply.\r\n           |             |              |           |---------+----------\r\n           |             | Raw material |  Annual   |         |\r\nMaterial.  | Pulp yield. | required per |  growth   |   For   | For 1 ton\r\n           |             |    year.     | per acre. |  25-ton | of fiber\r\n           |             |              |           |  mill.  | per year.\r\n-----------+-------------+--------------+-----------+---------+----------\r\nWood       | Two cords   | 15,000 cords | 0.37 cord |  40,500 |  5.4\r\n           | yield 1 ton |              | (about    |         |\r\n           | of fiber.   |              | 0.55 ton).|         |\r\n           |             |              |           |         |\r\nHemp hurds | One ton     | 25,000 tons  | 2.5 tons  |  10,000 |  1.33\r\n           | yields 600  |              |           |         |\r\n           | pounds      |              |           |         |\r\n           | of fiber.   |              |           |         |\r\n-----------+-------------+--------------+-----------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nThe most important point derived from this calculation is in regard to\r\nareas required for a sustained supply, which are in the ratio of 4 to 1.\r\nEvery tract of 10,000 acres which is devoted to hemp raising year by\r\nyear is equivalent to a sustained pulp-producing capacity of 40,500\r\nacres of average pulp-wood lands. In other words, in order to secure\r\nadditional raw material for the production of 25 tons of fiber per day\r\nthere exists the possibility of utilizing the agricultural waste already\r\nproduced on 10,000 acres of hemp lands instead of securing, holding,\r\nreforesting, and protecting 40,500 acres of pulp-wood land.\r\n\r\nThe annual growth per acre, although decidedly in favor of hurds, has\r\nlittle bearing on the project, because the utilization of the hurds is\r\nsubordinate to the raising of hemp, and the paper manufacturer probably\r\ncould afford to use only hurds resulting from the hemp industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PHYSICAL TESTS OF THE PAPERS PRODUCED.=\r\n\r\nSamples of paper produced in the seven tests were submitted to the\r\nLeather and Paper Laboratory of the Bureau of Chemistry.

The general character and\r\ntests of these papers correspond very closely with No. 1 machine-finish\r\nprinting paper, according to the specifications of the United States\r\nGovernment Printing Office, which call for a sheet not exceeding 0.0035\r\ninch in thickness, strength not less than 12 points, free from\r\nunbleached or ground wood pulp, and ash not over 10 per cent. The\r\nstrength factor of such papers is about 0.28. The ash should not be over\r\n10 per cent for this grade of paper, but in spite of the larger amount\r\nused the physical tests are sufficiently high. It is to be noted that\r\nthe physical tests of samples Nos. 138 to 142, inclusive, are higher\r\nthan in Nos. 143 and 144, in which 23 per cent of soda poplar was used,\r\nwhich shows clearly that hemp-hurd stock imparts strength and folding\r\nendurance to a greater extent than does soda-poplar stock. From these\r\npreliminary tests it would be concluded, therefore, that hemp-hurd stock\r\nacts similarly to soda-poplar stock, but will produce a somewhat harsher\r\nand stronger sheet and one of higher folding endurance. Undoubtedly,\r\nthere is more dirt in the samples than would be tolerated by the trade,\r\nbut this was to be expected, since in this preliminary work the raw\r\nmaterial was sieved by hand screens instead of by automatic machines\r\nwhich would sieve more thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CONCLUSIONS.=\r\n\r\nThere appears to be little doubt that under the present system of forest\r\nuse and consumption the present supply can not withstand the demands\r\nplaced upon it. By the time improved methods of forestry have\r\nestablished an equilibrium between production and consumption, the price\r\nof pulp wood may be such that a knowledge of other available raw\r\nmaterials may be imperative.\r\n\r\nSemicommercial paper-making tests were conducted, therefore, on hemp\r\nhurds, in cooperation with a paper manufacturer. After several trials,\r\nunder conditions of treatment and manufacture which are regarded as\r\nfavorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood, paper was\r\nproduced which received very favorable comment both from investigators\r\nand from the trade and which according to official tests would be\r\nclassed as a No. 1 machine-finish printing paper.",
