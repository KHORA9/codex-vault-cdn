In\r\npoultry buildings it has been our special purpose to present plans\r\nwhich illustrate the marked tendency of recent years, which has been to\r\nopen up the houses to sunshine and fresh air; a tendency which makes\r\nconditions more wholesome and promotes the good health and greater\r\nprofitableness of the flocks.\r\n\r\nOur editor, Mr. Hunter, wishes here to fully acknowledge his\r\nindebtedness to Bulletin No. 16 of the Cornell Reading Course for\r\nFarmers, entitled, “Building Poultry Houses,” also Farmers’ Bulletin\r\nNo. 141 of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, entitled, “Poultry\r\nRaising on the Farm,” from which he borrows many of the hints and\r\nsuggestions here given. Some of the poultry plans are taken, or\r\nadapted, from several poultry periodicals and Experiment Station\r\nBulletins, and for their kind courtesy our thanks are tendered.\r\n\r\n                                               F. W. BIRD & SON.\r\n     EAST WALPOLE, MASS., U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL FARM BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. POULTRY HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers’ Bulletin, No. 141, says: “Poultry houses need not be elaborate\r\nin their fittings or expensive in construction. There are certain\r\nconditions, however, which should be insisted upon in all cases. In\r\nthe first place, the house should be located upon soil which is well\r\ndrained and dry. A gravelly knoll is best, but, failing this, the site\r\nshould be raised by the use of the plow and scraper until there is\r\na gentle slope in all directions sufficient to prevent any standing\r\nwater even at the wettest times. A few inches of sand or gravel on the\r\nsurface will be very useful in preventing the formation of mud. If the\r\nhouse is sheltered from the north and northwest winds by a group of\r\nevergreens, this will be a decided advantage in the colder parts of the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nIn “Building Poultry Houses,” Professor Rice says: “Poultry keeping is\r\nan exacting business. The four corner-stones upon which success rests\r\nare:\r\n\r\n    (1) Suitable buildings, properly located.\r\n    (2) The right foods, skilfully fed.\r\n    (3) Good fowls, carefully bred.\r\n    (4) Facility and ability to hatch and rear chickens.”\r\n\r\nHere we find that “suitable buildings, properly located,” is the first,\r\nhence most important, of the four corner-stones upon which success with\r\npoultry rests, and in giving the buildings this prominence we believe\r\nthe professor is entirely right. No one thing does more to promote, or\r\nhinder, success with poultry than the buildings, hence the importance\r\nof a wise decision as to which of the many different patterns of houses\r\nis best adapted to your purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1—A plan to secure dryness.]\r\n\r\n_Select a dry location_; if the ground is not naturally dry make\r\nit so by draining it. The first illustration gives a plan for making\r\nthe interior of a poultry house absolutely dry, if the ground is fairly\r\nwell drained. The foundation walls are built up about eighteen inches\r\nabove the ground level; about twelve inches of this space is filled in\r\nwith small stones or coarse gravel, and the balance with fine sand or\r\ndry, sandy loam; on the outside the ground is sloped up to the level\r\nof the bottom of the sills, and thus all surface water is effectually\r\nturned away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2—The shape of the roof influences the\r\ncost.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3—Each of these houses require the same\r\nmaterial.]\r\n\r\n_In building a hen-house_ the working unit is the floor and air\r\nspace required for each hen. A safe working rule is about five to six\r\nsquare feet of floor space, and about eight to ten cubic feet of air\r\nspace for every fowl. Foundation walls should be built deep enough to\r\nprevent heaving by the frost and high enough to prevent surface water\r\nfrom entering. Where large stones are scarce sometimes grout walls may\r\nbe made with gravel or small stones and cement; or the building may\r\nbe set upon posts set well into the ground, in which case hemlock or\r\nhard wood boards should be securely nailed to bottom half of sills and\r\nextend down to natural ground level, to exclude rats.\r\n\r\n_Dampness is fatal to hens_; build or drain so as to secure\r\ndryness. It is better by far to have a cold, dry house than a warm,\r\ndamp house. The warmer the air the more moisture it will hold; when\r\nthis moist air comes in contact with a cold surface condensation takes\r\nplace, which is often converted into hoar-frost. The remedy is to\r\nremove the moisture as far as possible, by first cutting off the water\r\nfrom below which comes up from the soil. The water table is the same\r\nunder a hen-house as it is outdoors; dirt floors, therefore, are liable\r\nto be damp. Stone filling covered with soil is sometimes difficult to\r\nkeep clean and may only partially keep out dampness. Board floors are\r\nshort lived if the air is not allowed to circulate under them, and\r\nin a cold climate a free circulation of air under the floors makes\r\nthem very cold; in either case they are likely to harbor rats. A good\r\ncement floor is nearly as cheap as a good matched-board floor, counting\r\nlumber, sleepers, nails, time, etc. When once properly made it is good\r\nfor all time. It is practically rat-proof, easily cleaned and perfectly\r\ndry, cutting off absolutely all the water from below. If covered with a\r\nlittle soil, or straw, or both, as all floors should be, it will be a\r\nwarm floor.\r\n\r\n_A low house is easier warmed than a high one._ Solid walls\r\nradiate heat rapidly. The best way to make a poultry house warm is to\r\nbuild it as low as possible without danger of bumping heads. There\r\nwill then be ample air-space for as many fowls as the floor space will\r\naccommodate. Too much air-space makes a house cold; it cannot be warmed\r\nby the heat given off by the fowls.\r\n\r\n_Sunlight is a necessity to fowls_; it carries warmth and good\r\ncheer, and tends to arrest or prevent disease. Too much glass makes\r\na house too cold at night and too warm in the daytime, because glass\r\ngives off heat at night as readily as it collects it in the daytime.\r\nMuch glass makes construction expensive; allow one square foot glass\r\nsurface to about sixteen square feet floor space, if the windows are\r\nproperly placed. The windows should be high, and placed up and down,\r\nnot horizontally and low (Fig. 4). In the former the sunlight passes\r\nover the entire floor during the day, from west to east, drying and\r\npurifying practically the whole interior. The time sunshine is most\r\nneeded is when the sun is lowest, from September 21 to March 21. The\r\nlines in Fig. 4 represent the extreme points which the sunshine reaches\r\nduring this period, with the top of a four-foot window placed four\r\nfeet, six feet, and seven feet high, respectively. With the highest\r\npoint of the window at four feet, the direct sun’s rays would never\r\nreach farther back than nine feet; at six feet it would shine thirteen\r\nand one-half feet back, and at seven feet it would strike the back side\r\nof the house one foot above the floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4—Showing extent of sun’s rays.]\r\n\r\n_Make the yards long and narrow_ (Fig. 5). Double yards are\r\ndesirable where space can be given for them; they allow a rotation of\r\ngreen crops, which cleanses and sweetens the ground, and converts the\r\nexcrement which would become a source of danger into a valuable food\r\ncrop. The shape of the fields, the slope of the land, and the location\r\nof other farm buildings will have much to do with the shape of the yards\r\nand mode of access to the poultry buildings. Generally the yards should\r\nbe long and narrow, so as to make cultivation easy. Two rods wide and\r\neight rods long is a good size yard for forty or fifty hens, although\r\nmore room would be better. This size permits a row of fruit trees in\r\nthe center for shade, which is a necessity.\r\n\r\nMuch of the dampness in poultry houses in winter is due to the\r\ncondensation of the breath of the fowls. The warm air exhaled from the\r\nlungs is heavily charged with moisture, and this, coming in contact\r\nwith the cold roof and walls, is condensed into hoar-frost, which melts\r\nand drops to the floor when the house is warmed up by the sun. In\r\nrecent years considerable success has attended efforts made to prevent\r\nthis moisture by ventilating the pens through muslin curtains set into\r\nthe tops of doors, or forming a part of the front wall (see plans of\r\nDr. Bricault’s poultry house, page 12, and of the Maine Experiment\r\nStation House, page 18), also by setting the curtains into part of the\r\nwindow spaces. In Fig. 6 is given an illustration of an experiment\r\ntried on the Lone Oak Poultry Farm, Reading, Mass., in the winters of\r\n1904-6. Being much annoyed by the moisture which collected on the roof\r\nand walls in the night and, melting, dropped to the floor when the\r\nsun warmed the roof and walls during the day, frames the size of one\r\nfourth of each window were made and common muslin tacked on. To better\r\nascertain the effect of the curtains the windows in house No. 1 were\r\nleft closed, as formerly; in house No. 2 the top sash was dropped the\r\nlength of one light and a curtain set into the space; in house No.\r\n3 the windows were dropped from the top and raised from the bottom,\r\ncurtains being set into both spaces. In house No. 1 the dampness and\r\n“chill” remained as before; in house No. 2 there was some improvement;\r\nin house No. 3 there was a great improvement, and the temperature,\r\nin the coldest days of the winter, was about six degrees warmer in\r\nhouse No. 3 than in house No. 1 where the windows were all kept closed\r\ntight. The two curtains, making half the space of each window, were not\r\nquite sufficient to dry out the moisture, which had already got well\r\nestablished, but by installing the curtains both top and bottom as soon\r\nas the weather dropped below freezing the next fall, they were found to\r\nbe ample to keep the pens well ventilated and quite dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5—Make the yards long and narrow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6—An experiment with curtains in the windows.]\r\n\r\nSecure shelter and warmth by building in the lee of a windbreak or a\r\nhill, or of other farm buildings. Buildings that face the south, or\r\nabout two points east of south, will get the largest amount of exposure\r\nto the sun’s rays and protection from the cold northwest and west winds\r\nof winter; other things being equal they will be warmer, dryer, and\r\nmore cheerful. An eastern exposure is usually preferable to a western\r\nexposure, barring prevailing winds being from the east; because, like\r\nflowers, hens prefer morning to afternoon sun.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the roof of a poultry house greatly influences the cost,\r\nand, generally speaking, the preference should be for houses with\r\nsingle-span (or “shed”) roofs. See Figs. 2 and 3. These houses are the\r\neasiest and cheapest to build, they give the much-desired vertical\r\nfront, with room for the windows to be placed high to distribute the\r\nwinter sunshine (Fig. 4), and with the drip of the roof all carried off\r\nto the north the ground in front of the house is dry. It also is cooler\r\nin summer, as it is not exposed to the direct rays of the sun, and is\r\nwarmer in winter because it gets the direct rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7—An implement house adapted for poultry.]\r\n\r\nNot infrequently there are small buildings on the place which can be\r\neasily and economically adapted to poultry use; as, for example, an old\r\nimplement house, or grain house, or tool shed, which can be altered\r\ninto a one or two pen-house, as desired, by arranging windows and doors\r\nand adding one or two open-front scratching-sheds for exercise and\r\nfresh air (Figs. 7 and 10). In case there is no building suitable for\r\nremodelling into a poultry house an inexpensive lean-to may be built\r\nonto the south end of the stable (Fig. 9). A house of this kind can\r\nbe simply, economically, and conveniently built, and well supplies\r\nthe conditions for successful poultry keeping; we recently visited a\r\ndairy and poultry farm in Connecticut where house room for one hundred\r\nand fifty head of laying-breeding stock had been built in the lee of\r\nand annexed to the dairy barns and sheds. A good prepared roofing,\r\nsuch as “Paroid,” makes quite shallow and low lean-to roofs easy of\r\nconstruction, both air and water-tight, and very durable.\r\n\r\nSometimes a dweller in the suburbs, or one living on a small, rented\r\nplace, wants to keep a flock of fifteen or twenty head of fowls, to\r\nsupply the family with fresh-laid eggs during the fall, winter, and\r\nspring, and then fresh poultry meat for the table; these are all\r\ndisposed of before the family goes away to the country or seashore for\r\nthe summer, and another flock of well-matured pullets is bought in the\r\nfall. For such purpose the small portable house shown in Fig. 12, or\r\none of the several patterns of “colony-houses” given herein, will serve\r\nexcellently; all of these colony-houses are portable. A good size of\r\nhouse of this kind is ten feet long by seven feet wide, six feet high\r\nin front and four feet six inches high at the back; or for a flock of\r\neight or ten fowls eight feet long by five or six feet wide will answer\r\nwell. Houses of this type are built of a size to suit the builder, and\r\nthey can be easily moved to a new location at any time.\r\n\r\nExcellent patterns of small poultry houses, well adapted to the\r\nsuburban lot or for moving out into the orchard on a farm, are shown on\r\npages 8 and 9; these “colony” houses have proved their merits in many\r\ndifferent localities. They are especially valuable on a farm, where it\r\nis desired to locate a flock of half-grown chicks out in the stubble of\r\na newly-cut grain field, or colonies of chicks along the border of a\r\ncornfield, or on a poultry farm where extra room is needed for surplus\r\nstock and cockerels which are to be sold for breeding purposes. A solid\r\nboard floor enables shutting the birds in at night and keeping them in\r\nuntil the team has drawn them to the new location in the morning; it\r\nalso secures the birds against marauding animals at night, if the slide\r\ndoor has been closed. For convenience of drawing to a new location it\r\nis best to have them mounted on low runners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8—Ground Plan.]\r\n\r\nAn excellent plan of colony-house is given in Figs. 14 and 15, and\r\ncomes from the Connecticut Experiment Station; this combines the\r\nadvantages of the curtained-front scratching-shed with that of the\r\nsmall colony-house. This house is sixteen feet long by six feet wide,\r\nis six feet high in front and four feet high at the rear; the roosting\r\napartment being 7 × 6 feet and the scratching-shed 9 × 6 feet in size.\r\nA muslin curtain 4 × 8 feet, tacked to a light frame which is hinged\r\nto the top of open space, closes the front on cold nights and is kept\r\nclosed in stormy weather.\r\n\r\nOn page 17 we show a type of colony-house which is well adapted for a\r\nportable brooder house, an “in-door” brooder being placed in each end\r\nand fifty to seventy-five chicks being put in each brooder. When the\r\nchicks are large enough to do without artificial warmth the brooders\r\nare removed, the chicks being left till such time as it is well to\r\nseparate the sexes, when the cockerels can be removed and the pullets\r\nleft to grow to laying maturity. On page 42 we show an illustration of\r\nthirty of this pattern of colony brooder house in use on the “Gowell\r\nPoultry Farm,” Orono, Maine; a few over four thousand chickens were\r\nput into these thirty portable houses in the spring of 1905, nineteen\r\nhundred and eighty-five cockerels were sold off as broilers, some\r\nsixty more raised for breeding males, and a few over two thousand\r\nmature pullets taken from them in October and moved into the 400 feet\r\nlong poultry house which had been erected during the summer. When the\r\npullets were occupying them, in midsummer, they were turned about to\r\nface north and lifted up to about a foot and a half height above the\r\nground by stones about a foot in height being put under the ends of the\r\nrunners; this gave the pullets the much-needed shade of both the inside\r\nand underneath the house, a simple device, but decidedly helpful.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 11 we show a type of colony-house such as used on the large\r\ncolony poultry farms about Tiverton and Little Compton, R. I. These are\r\nusually about ten by sixteen feet in size, six feet high to the eaves\r\nwhen built with double-pitch roof, seven feet high in front and five\r\nfeet at back when shed roof. These houses are very simple in plan and\r\nconstruction, there being three roost-poles about three feet above the\r\nground at the back, five or six nest boxes, food trough, water dish\r\nand hopper for shells and grit. The houses hold about forty fowls, are\r\nplaced about a hundred and fifty to two hundred feet apart in locations\r\nconvenient to drive to with the feed and water-wagon, and on some of\r\nthe large farms as many as fifty to a hundred of these colony-houses\r\nmay be seen. The capital needed to equip a colony farm of this kind is\r\nvery much less than where long houses and yards are erected; the labor\r\ncharge of caring for the flocks is very much greater, however, so that\r\nwhat is saved in capital is expended in labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9—A lean-to poultry house.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10—Implement house with scratching-shed attached.]\r\n\r\nPoultry farmers in America have generally preferred the\r\ncontinuous-house plan of keeping fowls, and the resulting poisoned\r\nground of the yards has no doubt been the cause of many a failure in\r\nthe poultry business. An eminent English lecturer is authority for the\r\nstatement that the portable-house plan has been the saving of the\r\npoultry business in England, and bringing the small (portable) houses\r\ntogether near the other small buildings in winter, then moving them to\r\nconvenient locations out in the fields in the spring, has solved the\r\ndifficulty of extensive poultry farming over there. It would be well to\r\ncarefully consider these points while taking up the continuous-house\r\nplans which we give in following pages.\r\n\r\nAn objection to the scattered “colony-house” plan, as seen on the large\r\npoultry farms in Tiverton and Little Compton, R. I., has been the great\r\nlabor of feeding two or three times a day—one of the feeds being a\r\ncooked mash. By adopting the modern method of feeding the food dry and\r\nkeeping a supply of food constantly before the fowls a considerable\r\nsaving in labor is effected, and it is practicable to successfully\r\nkeep a large number with but one visit a day to the several flocks;\r\nthis would be an afternoon visit, for rinsing and refilling the\r\nwater fountains and collecting the eggs. By having the food-hoppers\r\nsufficiently capacious to hold a supply of food for a week but one\r\nvisit a week would be made for filling them.\r\n\r\nThis is the method adopted on the Vernon Fruit and Poultry Farm,\r\nVernon, Conn., where some three thousand head of layers are kept, the\r\nfood-hoppers being refilled once a week; as there is a little brook and\r\nnumerous springs convenient to the houses no watering whatever is done,\r\neach flock of fowls having but fifty to two hundred feet to journey to\r\nfind an abundant supply of running water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11—Type of house on Rhode Island colony poultry\r\nfarms.]\r\n\r\nOn the Gowell Poultry Farm, Orono, Maine, there is an excellent\r\nexample of the continuous-house, and by the partial adoption of the\r\ndry-feeding method the labor is so far reduced that one man can do all\r\nthe work of feeding and caring for two thousand head of layers, kept in\r\na house four hundred feet long by twenty feet wide, which is divided\r\ninto pens twenty feet square and one hundred birds kept in each. The\r\ndouble-yard system is in use here, there being one tier of yards one\r\nhundred feet long by twenty feet wide extending south from the house,\r\nand another tier of yards the same size north of the house; when the\r\nsouth-yards have been denuded of green food the birds are turned into\r\nthose north of the house, and the south-yards are plowed and sown (or\r\nplanted) to a quick-maturing crop. By this method poisoned ground\r\nis avoided and the conveniences of the continuous-house retained;\r\nthe safety of such a plant would lie, of course, in the intelligent\r\nhandling of the work. It is worthy of note that on the Gowell Farm\r\nthe portable colony-house method is in use in growing the young stock\r\n(see page 42), while the continuous-house method is used with the\r\nlaying-breeding stock. This is true of practically all of the large\r\npoultry farms, it being conceded that free range over farm-fields, or\r\nthrough orchard and woodland, promotes good growth in the young stock.\r\nWhen, however, it is desired to develop the physical energies towards\r\negg-production the semi-confinement of houses and yards is brought into\r\nplay; in this manner the greatest egg-yield, and consequent profit is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nHere are three different methods of avoiding the evil of\r\nground-poisoning: First, the continuous-house with double-yard system,\r\none set of yards being used while the other is being sweetened by a\r\ngrowing crop; second, the colony-house plan with houses located a\r\nhundred and fifty to two hundred feet apart and convenient to drive\r\nto for feeding and watering; third, the “portable-house” plan, which\r\nis the colony method with the houses changed from one location to\r\nanother, and brought together near the group of farm buildings for the\r\nwinter months. Convenience, amount of capital available, and other\r\nconsiderations, will influence the choice of a method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12—A small “portable” poultry house.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 14 we give an illustration of an elevated poultry house used in\r\nFlorida, which was published in the “Poultry Standard,” of Stamford,\r\nConn., and described as made of Neponset Red Rope Roofing, both top\r\nand sides; a better construction would be Paroid Roofing for roof and\r\nsides, or Paroid for roof and Neponset Red Rope Roofing for the ends\r\nand sides. This house is built upon posts set in the ground at the back\r\nand six feet high in front; the six posts, three front and three back,\r\nare all the frame required. The light furring to sustain the roof and\r\nsides is nailed to the posts, and the roofing securely nailed to the\r\nstrips of furring.\r\n\r\nThe open space below the house is enclosed by one-inch mesh wire\r\nnetting; there is no floor, and a narrow platform along the rear,\r\ninside, gives the hens access to the nest boxes, which are hinged at\r\none end, and swing out as shown in the drawing. The roost-poles should\r\nbe a foot above the open bottom, to be quite sheltered from winds.\r\n\r\nOf similar pattern is the “Mushroom Poultry House,” from Southern\r\nCalifornia. These houses may be built any size, but are usually made\r\nfour or five feet square. They set up from the ground about eighteen\r\ninches, and the closed sides are three feet, the posts being four and\r\none half above the ground. There is no floor used, the air circulating\r\nfreely beneath. When built of boards no frame is needed, the boarding\r\nbeing nailed to the posts. The roof goes up from all four sides, in\r\npyramid form, and is made water-tight. The roosts are placed about\r\nfifteen or eighteen inches above the bottom, as shown by the dotted\r\nlines, and a walk or ladder is provided which leads from the ground to\r\nthe rear roost. This is made movable, so that it can be taken down at\r\nnight, thus protecting the fowls from marauding animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13—A California “Mushroom” poultry house.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14—A Florida poultry house.]\r\n\r\nSome of the houses are built of iron advertising signs, and have the\r\ncommon double-pitch roof; in some cases the sides are made of burlap\r\ntacked on to furring, which is nailed to the posts. This burlap is\r\nthen painted with crude oil, distillate, and Venetian red, to make it\r\nwind-proof. Lumber is very expensive in that section, and the burlap,\r\nwhen water-proofed, makes a cheap and quite desirable house.\r\n\r\nA much better wind and water-tight construction would be Paroid for the\r\nroof, and Paroid or Neponset Red Rope Roofing for the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANTAGE OF DOUBLE YARDS\r\n\r\nWhen fowls are kept in the confinement of houses and yards an important\r\nquestion is how to keep the yards sweet. The ground becomes tainted\r\nin a couple of years or so, and then is a fruitful source of disease.\r\nUnless grass can be kept growing so as to keep the ground free from\r\nthe poison of the droppings there is no alternative but to change the\r\nground. It is well to have two runs, using each alternately, and by\r\nplanting the one vacated with some quick-growing crop it can be made\r\nready for occupancy again in a few weeks. An excellent crop for this\r\npurpose is Dwarf Essex Rape, which makes one of the best summer-green\r\nfoods for fowls confined to houses and yards; or such garden crops as\r\nsquashes, melons, etc., can be grown. After these rye or oats can be\r\nsown, to furnish green food in the fall.\r\n\r\nIt is a comparatively simple proposition to have the yards divided\r\ninto two sections, by setting the house in the middle, having half (or\r\ntwo-fifths or three-fifths) of the length of yards north of the house;\r\nthese north yards being used three or four months in summer, a crop of\r\nsome suitable kind being grown in the vacant yards south of the house\r\nin the meantime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15—Illustrates double yards for a continuous\r\npoultry house.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 17 we give a plan for such house and yards. In this plan we\r\nsuppose the yards to be one hundred and twenty-five feet long by\r\neighteen wide, and have placed fifty feet of length of yards north\r\nof the house and seventy-five feet of length south of it. There are\r\nlift-off gates next to the house in the fence south of the house, the\r\nsecond gate in illustration being shown as lifted off and leaning\r\nagainst the next panel of fence. These gates give access to all the\r\nyards, for plowing, harrowing, and cultivating a crop; also for driving\r\nup to the front of the pen with a cart to haul away the fouled earth\r\nof the floor of the house. The usual access to these yards is through\r\nthe house itself and a gate opening out of the scratching-shed; for\r\nordinary visits to the north yards there are small, swinging gates next\r\nto the house, and then lift-gates which will admit a team for plowing,\r\netc. There should be a row of fruit trees set in each yard, to give the\r\nneeded shade, and the trees give the owner a second source of profit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16—Dr. Bricault’s “New Idea” poultry house.]\r\n\r\nDesiring a poultry house which would give closed pens or could be\r\nopened up to admit the air and sunshine at will, Dr. C. Bricault,\r\nAndover, Mass., adapted the well-known “Dutch Door” to his purpose,\r\nputting the door in the middle of the front of each pen, and so\r\narranging it that the whole door could be open day and night, in warm\r\nweather, or the lower half of the door shut and the top half open, or\r\nthe top half could be closed by a curtain in quite cold weather, and\r\nin severe storms the whole door closed. The size of the pens are ten\r\nby twelve feet, the frame and building plan being substantially the\r\nsame as in the preceding house-plan, the doors in the front of each\r\npartition giving a passage through the entire length of the house.\r\nThere are two windows in the front of each pen; the roosts are set up\r\nagainst the partitions between the pens, and the trap-nests are set on\r\na platform against the north wall. The building is covered with a cheap\r\nsheathing paper, then with sheathing quilt, then Neponset Red Rope\r\nRoofing; a better construction would be Paroid Roofing on the roof and\r\nNeponset on the sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17—Interior of pen.]\r\n\r\nFig. 17 gives an interior view of one of the pens showing roosts and\r\ntrap-nests.\r\n\r\n\r\nA POULTRY HOUSE 240 FEET LONG\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18—A long poultry house on the White Leghorn\r\nPoultry Yards, Waterville, N.Y.]\r\n\r\nIn New York State it has been thought desirable to have warm houses\r\nfor the Single Comb White Leghorns so largely kept there, and we give\r\nillustrations of one of the long poultry houses of the White Leghorn\r\nPoultry Yards, Waterville, N.Y. This house is two hundred and forty\r\nfeet long by sixteen feet wide, divided into pens twelve feet square\r\nand a walk three and a half feet wide along the north side. It has a\r\nfloor of seven-eighths inch matched boards throughout. The outside\r\nwalls are first boarded, then covered with sheathing and clapboarded.\r\nThe inside of the building is boarded up with matched boards on the\r\ninside of the studs, making a four-inch dead air space between the\r\nwalls. The ceilings are made of matched boards laid at the level of the\r\nplates. In this ceiling, over the centre of each pen, is a small trap\r\ndoor, two feet square, opening up into the attic space above, which is\r\ndesigned to give diffusive ventilation.\r\n\r\nThree ventilating cupolas cap the roof, and there are full-sized\r\nwindows in each gable end. This attic space is storage room for straw,\r\nwhich is drawn upon from time to time, to furnish scratching material\r\nfor the pen floors and opening the trap-door into the ceiling, it\r\ngives excellent ventilation without drafts. A door opens from the\r\nalleyway into each pen, and doors in the partition between the pens\r\npermit passing through from pen to pen. The roost platforms with nest\r\nboxes beneath are against the partition between the walk and pens and\r\nthe plan of partitions between pens as shown in Fig. 19. The roof is\r\ncovered with Paroid Roofing. A fault here is the wire netting in these\r\npartitions; a better plan would be matched-board partitions throughout.\r\n\r\nThe twelve feet square pens have one hundred and forty-four square feet\r\nof floor space each, giving ample room for twenty-five head of layers,\r\nand while a long house of this description is somewhat expensive\r\nto build, it has many advantages, which, on a large and permanent\r\npoultry plant, will more than make up for the first cost in the ease\r\nand economy of feeding, etc., and the warmth of the house and the\r\nsimplicity of the ventilation. This style of poultry house has been\r\nin use on the White Leghorn farm for several years, and it has been\r\nfound to be both practical and economical; it combines very completely\r\nthe laying and the breeding house. On this plant they practise the\r\nalternate system of males in the pens, a small coop for the extra male\r\nbeing set against the partition in one corner of the pen, four feet up\r\nfrom the floor. One male bird is cooped up while the other runs with\r\nthe hens and they are exchanged every two or three days, the change\r\nbeing effected at night, on occasion of the shutting-up visit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19—Interior, showing partitions between pens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20—Interior of pens, showing roosts.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. DUSTON’S POULTRY HOUSES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21—Mr. A. G. Duston’s five-pen breeding house.]\r\n\r\nOne of America’s most successful poultrymen is Mr. Arthur G. Duston,\r\nSouth Framingham, Mass., and as he has recently established himself on\r\na new farm, to secure necessary room, the type of poultry houses he\r\ndecides are the best for him is of interest. He is building seventeen\r\nhouses of five pens each, and uses some thirty odd of his well-known\r\ncolony-houses (Fig. 23). The five-pen houses are raised from the ground\r\nfrom two to three feet, the space beneath being utilized as scratching\r\nroom. Each house is fifty by twelve feet, the pens being ten by twelve\r\nfeet each, and there is a window and door in the front of each pen;\r\ndoors in the front of partitions allow passing through from pen to pen.\r\nThe roosts are at the back, with nest boxes beneath the roost platforms.\r\n\r\nThis house has a short hip-roof sloping south, which is open to the\r\nobjection of carrying part of the roof-drip to the front of the\r\nhouse,—a fault which can be mitigated by a gutter along the front, but\r\nthat increases the cost without always giving complete relief from the\r\ndrip; we decidedly prefer the single-slope roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22—Ground plan and cross-section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23—Mr. Duston’s “colony” house.]\r\n\r\nMr. Duston’s “colony,” or portable, houses are justly favorites, the\r\ndistinctive feature of them being the double door, or wire netting door\r\ncovered with a second door. These “colony” houses are ten by five feet\r\non the ground, five feet high in front, and four feet high at the back,\r\nand have board floors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAW-LOFT POULTRY HOUSE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24—The straw-loft poultry house.]\r\n\r\nIn New York state, especially, the Single Combed White Leghorns have\r\nlong been the preferred variety, and, as they have rather thin single\r\ncombs, which are considered to be susceptible to frost in cold weather,\r\nit has been a problem to house them so that they shall be protected\r\nfrom freezing. Many different types of houses have been tried, some of\r\nthem with a stove in one end and a long pipe running through to the\r\nchimney at the other, thirty or forty feet away; a decided disadvantage\r\nwith this was the having to keep the house shut quite tight to conserve\r\nthe heat, and the consequent dampness from the moisture of the breath\r\nof the birds.\r\n\r\nTo get over this difficulty diffused ventilation was devised by Mr. H.\r\nJ. Blanchard, of Fairview Farm, Groton, N. Y.; this ventilation was\r\nobtained by stowing straw (or swale hay) in the loft in the gable, and\r\nthis permits a slow diffusion of air upward through the cracks of the\r\nfloor and out of the small doors in each end of gable. This straw-loft\r\npoultry house has been widely adopted all over the United States; a\r\ngood example of a long house of this type is shown in the illustration\r\non page 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\nMr. Blanchard’s houses are forty feet long by sixteen feet wide, and\r\ndivided into two pens twenty by sixteen feet each; about fifty birds\r\nare wintered in each pen. The walls of the house are made double,\r\nboarded on both sides of the studs with a dead air space between; in\r\nsome cases the walls are packed with saw dust or planer shavings, at\r\nthe well-known Van Dresser farm, in Cobleskill, N.Y., they are packed\r\nwith straw. The floor is double boarded, with a good sheathing paper\r\nbetween. Overhead, on the plates, two by six inch stringers are laid,\r\nand a loose floor of rough boards, with inch to inch and a half cracks\r\nbetween, is laid. A one-third pitch roof is laid on shingle laths nailed\r\nto the rafters six inches apart, and on this a good sheathing paper\r\ncovered with two-ply Paroid. In each gable a door is cut, as large as\r\nwill swing under the roof. On the attic floor is put some twelve to\r\nfifteen inches of loose straw.\r\n\r\nIn very cold weather, when the house is tightly closed save for a\r\nmuslin curtain in one or two windows of each pen, the vapor thrown\r\noff in the breath of the fowls will pass up through the cracks in\r\nthe loft-floor and be absorbed in the straw above, instead of being\r\ncondensed on the walls and roof in the form of frost. On mild days in\r\nwinter the doors in the gable may be opened wide, or if it is very\r\nwindy the door in the leeward end may be opened, which permits the\r\nair to draw through over the straw, drying it thoroughly, without any\r\ndraughts upon the birds on the floor below.\r\n\r\nIn warm weather the gable doors may be left open night and day, and\r\nthe draught through the loft, together with the ventilation through\r\nopen doors and windows in the house below, keeps the birds cool and\r\ncomfortable. These houses are thoroughly practical in every way and\r\nwill be found very desirable for use on any large farm. A few such\r\nscattered in convenient localities will give good opportunity to rotate\r\ncrops and poultry, and so gain a two-fold profit from the land and\r\nat the same time avoid all danger of the soil becoming poisoned by\r\naccumulation of the droppings. At Fairview Farm Mr. Blanchard combines\r\nfruit growing with poultry keeping, a combination which it would be\r\ndifficult to better for double profits, and a combination which should\r\nbe better understood by poultry growers. The advantages of combining\r\nfruit and poultry growing are many, not the least of the advantages\r\nbeing furnishing the shade which Prof. Rice tells us is so essential in\r\nsummer. For the permanent yards there is nothing to equal apple trees,\r\nbut as they are of somewhat slow growth and need large space when full\r\ngrown, it is well to set apple trees about forty feet apart and set\r\nplums or peaches (or both) in the spaces between; the plum and peach\r\ntrees will mature, produce a few crops of fruit and break down, before\r\nthe apple trees will have grown to a stature to require all the room. A\r\nfew years ago plum trees were strongly recommended for poultry yards,\r\nbut experience has demonstrated that they cannot be depended upon for\r\nbut a half dozen years or so, hence the wisdom of setting apple trees\r\nfor permanent shade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26—West Virginia Experiment Station Colony-house.]\r\n\r\nPlantations of small fruits, such as grapes, blackberries, and\r\nraspberries, serve admirably for range and semi-shade for growing\r\nchicks, and it is a mistake to imagine that the chicks damage the\r\ncrops of fruit; if they touch any it will only be the lower (and\r\nalways inferior) stems that they reach. There are such substantial\r\nbenefits accruing from the presence of little chicks about the small\r\nfruit plantations, or the mature birds about the apple, plum, and\r\npeach trees—such as the destruction of hosts of worms and insects and\r\nkeeping the surface of the ground stirred, that every consideration\r\nurges the combination of fruit and poultry growing. At the Vernon Fruit\r\nand Poultry Farm, Vernon, Conn., we saw last summer Baldwin apple\r\ntrees that were six inches through at the butt, yielded an average of\r\na barrel of choice apples each in the fall, and had been set only six\r\nyears. They began bearing the second year after setting, had borne\r\nincreasing crops every year, last season averaged to be about six\r\ninches through and gave their owner a barrel of apples each. These\r\napple trees were part of an orchard which was occupied by colony\r\npoultry houses having fifty layers each, and set sufficient distance\r\napart so that there were about two hundred birds to the acre; the owner\r\ntold us he had never seen a borer or any evidence of borers about those\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27—Colony poultry house at Connecticut Experiment\r\nStation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURTAIN-FRONT, CURTAINED-ROOSTING-CLOSET, POULTRY HOUSE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29—The curtain-front,\r\ncurtained roosting-closet, poultry house. Maine Experiment Station.]\r\n\r\nAs stated elsewhere, the tendency in poultry house construction today\r\nis to more and more open up the houses to fresh air and sunshine,\r\nand the most advanced type of the fresh air poultry house has been\r\ndeveloped at the Maine Experiment Station, Orono, Maine. This consists\r\nof a house-front about half open, a little more than a fourth of each\r\npen-front being closed by a cloth curtain only, two windows and a door\r\nmaking with the curtain about half of the whole front of each pen.\r\n\r\nAt the rear of each pen, and elevated three feet above the pen-floor,\r\nis a curtained-front “roosting closet,” as it is called; this roosting\r\ncloset is the “bed-room” and the whole pen the “living-room,” in this\r\ntype of house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30—Cross-section.]\r\n\r\nIt seems almost like cruelty to animals to put hens in such houses,\r\nwhere they have but the two cloth curtains between them and all\r\noutdoors in the very cold winters they have up in central Maine; the\r\nMaine Station is very nearly up to forty-five north latitude, about the\r\nsame as Ottawa, Ontario, St. Paul, Minn., and Portland, Oregon. One of\r\nthe Station bulletins, however, says: “These curtain-front houses have\r\nall proved eminently satisfactory. Not a case of cold or snuffles has\r\ndeveloped from sleeping in the warm elevated closets with the cloth\r\nfronts, and then going down into the cold room, onto the dry straw,\r\nand spending the day in the open air. The egg-yield per bird has been\r\nas good in these houses as in the warmed one.” In a letter written by\r\nProf. Gowell, just after an extremely cold period, he says: “This is\r\nthe ninth day of weather all the way from zero to twenty-five degrees\r\nbelow, still the fifty pullets in the ten by twenty-five feet curtained\r\nfront house with its curtained-front roosting-room have fallen off but\r\nlittle in their egg-yield, and both the house and scratching material\r\non the floor are perfectly dry. There is no white frost on the walls\r\nand there will be no dampness when the weather moderates and a thaw\r\ncomes.” There could hardly be a stronger indorsement of fresh, pure air\r\nin a poultry house and good ventilation without draughts. If such good\r\nresults can be attained in cold Maine they can be attained anywhere in\r\nthe United States and southern Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31—Maine Station Colony Brooder House.]\r\n\r\nThe Maine Experiment Station has now three of these curtain-front\r\nhouses, of which one is one hundred and forty feet long by twelve\r\nfeet wide, divided into pens twenty by twelve feet in size, in each\r\npen being housed fifty birds; the other is one hundred and twenty by\r\nsixteen feet, divided into pens thirty by sixteen feet, and one hundred\r\nhens are kept in each. On Prof. Gowell’s farm, two miles distant from\r\nthe Station, he erected last year a house of this type four hundred\r\nfeet long by twenty feet wide, divided into pens twenty by twenty\r\nfeet each, and a hundred birds are kept in each pen; in the thirty\r\nby sixteen feet pens there is a floor space of four and eight-tenths\r\nfeet per bird; in the twenty by twenty feet pens the floor space is\r\nfour feet per bird. It is of interest to note that the one hundred\r\nbirds, Barred Plymouth Rocks, penned on this four hundred square feet\r\nof floor space, do not go outdoors from the time they are put in\r\nthe house in October till the ground of the yards is well dried off\r\nin spring, say about May first; this suggests the practicability of\r\nhousing laying-stock in suitable convenient buildings in winter, pains\r\nbeing taken that ample sunshine and fresh air (through curtains) be\r\nsupplied, and in the spring the birds be moved out to portable colony\r\nhouses scattered about the orchard, or a wood-lot, or other convenient\r\nplace, where they would be pushed for a liberal egg-yield through the\r\nsummer and sold off to market before molting time in the fall. This\r\nplan supposes the rearing of another generation of pullets for layers\r\nduring the summer, and these pullets go into the winter-laying-pens\r\nin October, to be removed to the colony-houses in May, to be in turn,\r\nsold off to market in September. This plan of an annual rotation\r\nof laying-stock will undoubtedly give the best financial returns\r\nfrom egg-farming, and as by the adoption of the dry-feeding method\r\nof handling the fowls the labor is reduced to the minimum, the\r\nresults, with intelligent management of the business should be quite\r\nsatisfactory; the profits will be liberal for amount of capital\r\ninvested and labor engaged.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 29 we give a single pen of the one hundred and twenty feet long\r\nhouse, with a door opening into each pen from the board-walk along the\r\nfront. Each pen has two windows, which light the interior when the\r\nweather is stormy and it is necessary to keep the curtain closed; the\r\ncurtain is open every day when the weather is fair. There are banks of\r\nnest boxes at each end of pens, and coops for breaking up broody birds\r\nabove the nest boxes. The twelve by four feet curtain in the pen-front\r\nis hinged at top so it may be swung up against the roof and hooked\r\nup there; the roosting closet is up three feet from the floor, the\r\nplatform is three feet wide, and the curtain which closes the front is\r\nthe whole length of the pen, and also swings up against the roof, where\r\nhooks secure it up out of the way. The whole floor of the pen is open\r\nfor exercise, and is an enclosed out-of-doors pen all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINUOUS CURTAINED-FRONT SCRATCHING-SHED POULTRY HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe tendency in poultry house construction in recent years has\r\nbeen to more and more open up the house to fresh air and sunshine,\r\nand this opening up of the houses, and getting more and more fresh\r\nair and sunshine into them, has been a decided step in advance in\r\npoultry work. There are many modifications and adaptations of the\r\nscratching-shed plan of house, perhaps the best known of them being\r\nthe “scratching-pen” plan, and the enclosed-roosting-closet plan,\r\nthe latter being the one evolved at the Maine Experiment Station\r\nand illustrated on page 16. In this enclosed-roosting-closet house\r\nwe see the entire floor of the pen a curtained-front scratching\r\npen and the roosting apartment lifted up and enclosed by another\r\ncurtain-front; in the one we have the shed one department and the\r\nroosting-laying department another (one a “living-room” and the other\r\nthe “bed-room”), with wide range of adaptability in the way of opening\r\nup the roosting-laying room; in the other the enclosed roosting-closet,\r\nor “bed-room,” and scratching-shed, or “living-room,” are in the\r\none apartment. Certain it is the curtained-front scratching-shed\r\ntype of house that has been growing very rapidly in favor with\r\npractical poultrymen, and probably combines more advantages with fewer\r\ndisadvantages than any other one style of poultry house.\r\n\r\nEach combined pen and shed covers eighteen by ten feet, the\r\ncurtained-front shed being ten by ten feet, and the roosting-room\r\nadjoining being eight by ten feet, room sufficient for twenty-five\r\nto thirty fowls of the American or thirty-five to forty of the\r\nMediterranean varieties. No “walk” is required because the walk is\r\nthrough gates and doors, from shed to pen and pen to shed, and so\r\non to the end of the house and out the other end. The much-desired\r\nventilation of the poultry house is very varied in this plan, at the\r\ndiscretion and according to the judgment of the operator, and can be\r\nadapted to the different seasons in half a dozen different ways. In\r\nsummer the doors and windows are all wide open and the curtains are\r\nhooked up against the roof out of the way. (It is to be remembered\r\nthat the doors between two pens are never to be left open when there\r\nare birds in the pens, they are always kept closed except when opened\r\nfor the attendant to pass through from one pen to another). When the\r\nnights begin to be decidedly frosty in the fall close the windows\r\nin the fronts of the roosting pens, but leave shed-curtains hooked up\r\nand doors between pens and sheds open. When it begins to freeze nights\r\nclose the curtains (at night) in fronts of sheds, but still leave\r\ndoors between pens and sheds open. These doors (including the slide\r\ndoor) are never closed excepting on nights of solid cold, say when\r\nthe thermometer runs five to twenty degrees below zero; and for real\r\nzero weather, from five above to away below zero, close the curtains\r\nin front of roosts and all doors and windows are closed. An additional\r\nprotection against cold in extremely cold latitudes would be to\r\ndouble-wall the back of the roost-pen, from the sill up to plate and\r\nthen up the roof-rafters four feet, packing the spaces between the\r\nstuds and rafters with planer shavings, straw, swale hay, or seaweed\r\n(the latter is vermin-proof), then have a hinged curtain to drop down\r\nto within about six inches of front of roost platform, and extending\r\na foot below it; this curtain we would close only on the very coldest\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nWe would build this house seven feet high in front and five feet high\r\nat the back. Sills and plates are all of two by four scantling, halved\r\nand nailed together at joints. The rafters, corner studs, and studs in\r\ncenters of fronts of sheds are all two by four; the intermediate studs\r\nare two by three. Set the sills on stone foundation a foot and a half\r\nabove the ground level, or on posts set into the ground below the usual\r\nfrost line, the posts being set five feet apart excepting in front of\r\nroosting pens (where they come four feet apart)—there being a post at\r\ncorner of each pen and shed, with one between. The rafters should be\r\ntwo feet between centers; as lumber comes twelve, fourteen, or sixteen\r\nfeet in length, and two-feet-apart rafters allow the lumber to be used\r\nwith almost no waste. The sills we would set a foot and a half above\r\naverage ground level. When set on posts put hemlock (or some hard wood)\r\nboards from bottom half of sill down to ground, nailing them firmly\r\nto sill and foundation posts; then fill up inside to bottom of sills\r\nand slope the ground outside to same height, as illustrated in Fig.\r\n1. Toe-nail studs to sills firmly, plates to studs ditto, and rafters\r\nto plates. Set the studs in front of roosting pens to take the window\r\nframes (or the window sash, if no frames are used), and in partitions\r\na stud should be set to take the two and one half feet wide doors and\r\ngates. All of the framing is simple and easy, and any man who can\r\nsaw off a board or joist reasonably square and drive nails straight\r\ncan build this house; the slight bevel at each end of rafters being\r\nperfectly simple. All boarding is lengthwise, the boards firmly nailed\r\nand good joints made all over. Cover the roof and sides with Paroid,\r\nand the house will be wind and waterproof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32—The Continuous, Curtained-Front Scratching-shed\r\nPoultry.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALL-OPEN-FRONT POULTRY HOUSE\r\n\r\nThis “Fresh Air Poultry House” has been evolved by Mr. Joseph Tolman, a\r\npractical poultryman of eastern Massachusetts, some twenty-five miles\r\nsouth of Boston, and differs from most other plans in that the front is\r\nwide open night and day all the year around; the south front is always\r\nopen, being closed by one-inch mesh wire netting only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33—The All-Open-Front Poultry House.]\r\n\r\nThe roof and sides are one inch boards nailed to two by four inch\r\nrafters and studs, and covered with sheathing paper and two-ply Paroid;\r\nthis makes a tight roof, and east, west, and north walls, excepting\r\nthat there is a window in the center of the west side and a door\r\nopposite it, in center of east side. In operating this house in summer\r\nboth the door and window are removed and wire netting tacked to a\r\nlight frame set in the places; for convenience we recommend that the\r\ndoor-screen be hinged to outside of door frame, and when not in use\r\nhooked back against the wall. There are many nights in spring and fall\r\nwhen it is desirable to leave the door open excepting that the opening\r\nis closed by the wire screen, and possibly the very next night it is\r\nbetter that the door be closed; having the door-screen hung to the wall\r\nenables adapting to weather changes at will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\nThe house here shown is made eight by fourteen feet in size, four feet\r\nto eaves and seven feet to apex of roof, and makes a fine home for\r\ntwenty-five fowls; a larger size of this house is recommended to be\r\nmade twenty-one by fourteen feet on the ground, with five feet posts\r\nin north and south ends and eight feet to apex of roof; this would\r\ncomfortably house fifty head of layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. BARNS, STABLES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a very great diversity in plans of barns and stables, the\r\ntaste of individual owners seeming to favor this or that plan, which\r\nthey think is best adapted to their needs. Observation of various types\r\nof farm buildings, however, will convince the thoughtful man that too\r\noften a single point of convenience is magnified till other points\r\nare wholly obscured, and to secure the one advantage several decided\r\nconveniences are sacrificed; in a study of conveniences all possible\r\npoints should be considered and a decision arrived at which will give\r\nthe greatest and sacrifice the least number.\r\n\r\nTalking with a dairy farmer living in central New York, who had just\r\ncompleted a dairy barn which cost him about three thousand dollars,\r\nhe told that he had waited a dozen years to build that barn, and had\r\nstudied and figured to get the two most important conveniences of a\r\ncement floor to preserve the liquid manure and a drive-way onto the\r\nmain floor; to get those he had let go one or two others which he\r\nconsidered of far less importance, and had at last got a barn exactly\r\nto his liking. One of the conveniences which he had let go was a\r\ncovered-way to the barn, and this one point is considered of so great\r\nimportance by many that almost everything else is sacrificed to gain\r\nit. We were discussing this point with a farmer whose barn was about\r\na hundred and fifty feet away from his house, and he was positive\r\nthat the advantage of having the barn near to and connected with the\r\ndwelling house was over-estimated; that there were but a very few days\r\nin a year when the covered-way was of so great advantage, and there\r\nwere decided advantages in having the barn a little distance from the\r\nhouse,—among them absence of barn-odors, flies, and noises. With the\r\nbarn off a little distance he avoids those, and gains the (to him)\r\ngreat advantage of a drive-way onto the main floor, a fine basement for\r\ncomposting the manure and housing the farm carts, etc., and a drive-way\r\nout of the basement with only an insignificant rise to the level of the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThis same farm-barn had one defect, to remedy which we offered the\r\nsuggested shed shown in Fig. 35. The barn extended very nearly east\r\nand west, consequently the linter door was exposed to the cold west\r\nand northwest winds of winter, and during the winter the farmer wanted\r\nhis cows to have the exercise-room of the barn yard on the south side\r\nof the barn. To overcome the difficulty we suggested an open-front\r\nshed along the west side of the barn yard, and a covered-in walk down\r\nfrom the linter door to the shed; as subsequently built the shed was\r\nextended five feet beyond the corner of the barn, so as to cover the\r\nlinter door, and a broad door in the shed-end gave out to the lane\r\nleading to the pasture. By closing that broad door in the end of the\r\nshed and opening a gate to the barn yard a covered-way was made for the\r\ncows to pass from the linter to the barn yard, without being exposed to\r\nthe cold winds of winter, and gaining the complete shelter of the shed\r\non the west; a simple expedient, and yet a very decided convenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35—A convenient shed-shelter for west end of barn\r\nyards.]\r\n\r\nDriveways onto two or more different floors of a barn or stable are\r\nmost substantial aids to the economical doing of the farm work. On\r\na large Essex county (Mass.) farm which we recently visited a new\r\nhay-barn was being erected, the site for it being especially selected\r\nso that an easy grade could be built to the top floor, permitting the\r\nhay wagons being driven into the top of the barn, under the high roof,\r\nand all the hay was pitched off and down into the twenty-feet deep\r\nmows. A recent letter says: “The new barn is practically done, and\r\nalready some twenty loads of hay are in one corner of it. We find it\r\na great saving of labor; four men in the barn will take better care\r\nof the hay and keep ahead of the gang in the field easier than seven\r\nmen and a horse could put it into the top of the barn with a fork.”\r\nA second drive-way leads out of the ground floor of this barn to the\r\nhigh road, practically on a level, and a third out of the west end of\r\nthe basement, whence an easy grade rises to the farm roads. By these\r\nconvenient driveways much hard work is eliminated—a most important point\r\nin these days of growing scarcity of farm help. Because of this great\r\nscarcity of help, especially of dependable help, it is a necessity that\r\nthe farmer take advantage of every convenience, or labor-saving device,\r\nwhich will aid him in his work; it is both good economy and good\r\nbusiness policy for him to do so.\r\n\r\nWe have thought it wise to give here a few simple, practical plans,\r\nwhich have approved themselves in everyday use. Barns and stables\r\nneed not be expensive in construction nor elaborate in fittings;\r\nthe important considerations are the comfort of the animals, the\r\nconvenience of the owner and the adaptability of the building to its\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIn Figs. 36, 37, and 38 we give a plan for a village stable, for the\r\nman who keeps a horse and one or two cows, and the ground floor also\r\nprovides room for the work-bench (which is most desirable where there\r\nare boys in the family), besides standing room for the carriage, wagon\r\nand sleigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36—A village stable for a horse and cow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37—Cross-section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\nThis stable is planned to be twenty-six feet long by eighteen feet\r\nwide, is ten feet from floor level to eaves, and fourteen feet from\r\nfloor to ridge of roof. More pitch can be given to roof if desired, but\r\nwith a good roofing like Paroid the roof slope may be slight. It would\r\nbe better to make the walls two feet higher if more storage space is\r\ndesired above the scaffold floor. The doorway is eight by eight feet,\r\nand stall space eight by eight feet is made in each front corner; a box\r\nstall is provided for the horse and two cow stalls in the left-hand\r\ncorner, with a small door opening into the cow linter. Hay scaffolds\r\nseven feet above the floor extend across each end and may be joined at\r\nthe rear if desired; a scaffold floor above the large doors extends\r\nfrom front to rear, or to the drop-scaffold walk connecting the two\r\nside scaffolds at the rear. A basement six or seven feet deep under the\r\nwhole is a valuable addition to such a stable, making room for storing\r\nand rotting the manure, and a storage room for roots, etc., in one\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nSix-inch-square sills, posts, and floor stringers are amply strong for\r\nthe strain usually put upon a small stable, and the center posts, set\r\nat corners of box stall and cow stalls, help carry the main floor and\r\nthe storage floor above. If preferred, the intermediate posts may be\r\nset in the center and the stall-spaces extended a foot, making them\r\neight by nine feet. With the roof covered with Paroid Roofing, and\r\nthe sides with Neponset Red Rope Roofing battened on laps and halfway\r\nbetween laps, a very neat and economically constructed stable is made.\r\nIf desired a richer appearance may be given to the roof by adding the\r\nornamental battens shown on page 28 and painting the whole a dark red.\r\n\r\nThe farm-barn is a most important aid to economy of labor, if rightly\r\nplanned, and we give on this page the plans of a small barn, for a\r\nfarm where eight or ten cows are kept, such as is quite common in New\r\nEngland and the Middle States, and which gives excellent satisfaction\r\neverywhere. On the farm where this plan was studied the pair of horses\r\nwere housed in a small horse barn nearer the dwelling house, the\r\nDemocrat wagon, canopy top carriage and sleigh, etc., being under the\r\nsame roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39—A barn for a small dairy farm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41—Cross-section.]\r\n\r\nThis barn is forty-four feet long by thirty-four feet wide, and is\r\nbuilt in four “bays” of eleven feet in length each. The main floor is\r\ntwelve feet wide, and hay wagons drive in at either end and out at the\r\nother. The cow stalls occupy all of the linter on the south side, a\r\ndoor at the end opening into the lane to the pasture. The first bay\r\non the north side is ceiled up with tongued and grooved boards, has a\r\ntight floor overhead, and is used as a grain storeroom; the other three\r\nbays on that side are hay mows from floor to roof.\r\n\r\nOver the main floor and fifteen feet above it is a floor for hay, or\r\ncorn, or used for general storage at different seasons. There was no\r\nfloor on the collar-beams when the present owner bought the farm.\r\nStrong poles had been laid across the space and surplus hay thrown\r\non them; since being floored over the owner says it is the best part\r\nof the barn, and invaluable for drying out crops not fully cured. A\r\nbasement about six feet in depth receives the manure from the cows,\r\nand three or four logs have the run of the cellar and manure heaps,\r\nthoroughly rotting and “fining” the manure for the next season’s crops.\r\n\r\nThe frame of this barn is of eight-inch square hemlock timber, the\r\nbraces three by four inch hemlock mortised into posts and stringers,\r\nthe floor stringers three by nine inches, two feet apart and well\r\ncross-bridged, the floor of three-inch plank. The scaffold floor is of\r\ninch boards laid on two by six inch stringers three feet apart, and is\r\namply strong for any load put upon it.\r\n\r\nGrain bins along two sides of the grain room may be four feet wide,\r\nand, fitted with drop fronts may be five feet high and divided into two\r\nor more compartments. Two small bins may be fitted in each side of the\r\nwindow; the window may be in the end if preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE DAIRY BARN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42—A complete dairy barn, with silo.]\r\n\r\nModern dairy farming means an up-to-date dairy barn, and we give\r\nherewith the plans of one which is warmly endorsed by the owner and\r\ncarries fifty cows in perfect comfort. This is a truss-frame barn,\r\nninety-three feet long by forty feet wide, the basement (or ground)\r\nfloor being wholly occupied by cow stalls and calving pens, the main\r\nfloor being a hay-storage room. Two bays on one side are used for grain\r\nstorage, all the remainder of the bays on both sides being for hay; a\r\ndrive-way fifteen feet wide extends through this floor, and inclined\r\ndriveways at each end give access from the fields in either direction.\r\n\r\nThe ground floor is concrete throughout. A walk five feet wide extends\r\nalong each side and cross walks three feet wide are between each row\r\nof stalls at both front and rear, one for breeding and the other for\r\nthe cows and the milkers. A shallow gutter, eighteen inches wide by\r\nsix inches deep, extends along the rear of the stalls to receive the\r\ndroppings and urine, which is removed twice a day and drawn at once to\r\nthe fields or heaped for tramping over and rotting under wide-roofed\r\nsheds. The calving stalls, four at each end of this floor, are eight by\r\nseven and three quarters feet in size, and one or two of them can be\r\noccupied by bulls, if desired.\r\n\r\nThe watering system may be either a wooden gutter extending along the\r\nfront of each row of stalls or a cast-iron semicircular pan set between\r\neach pair of stalls so as to supply a cow on either side. Whether\r\ntroughs or pans are used there should be an automatic cock and tank,\r\nwhich keeps the water always at the desired level, and check valves\r\nwhich prevent the water once in the trough or basin returning to the\r\npipe and contaminating others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43—Cross-section showing truss-frame\r\nplan.]\r\n\r\nAll the food is stored on the main floor, whence convenient chutes\r\nconvey it to feeding troughs or push-carts on the walks below. The\r\nensilage from the silo is loaded directly into the push-carts just\r\noutside the door, or could be chuted to the walk inside. The soiling\r\ncrops fed in summer are cut up on the main floor and sent down to the\r\nwaiting push-carts in the walks below. The roof and sides of this barn\r\nare covered with Paroid roofing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44—Ground floor plan of basement story.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45—Floor plan of main floor.]\r\n\r\nThe tying arrangement may be either chains, straps, or swing stanchions\r\nas desired, and all three methods are in use on up-to-date dairy barns.\r\nThe stock kept may have an influence upon the length of the stalls;\r\nthose given are seven and one half feet long by three feet three inches\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STABLE FOR A SUBURBAN PLACE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46—A stable for a suburban place.]\r\n\r\nA convenient and well-arranged stable is greatly appreciated, and we\r\npresent plans for a stable for four horses, with carriage room, harness\r\nroom, man’s room, etc., hay-loft, platform for drying the bedding, and\r\nother accessories of a modern stable for a suburban home. It is built\r\nwithout cupola or other ornamental features, is just a plain, simple\r\nstable.\r\n\r\nThis building is forty-four by twenty-four feet in size, the sides and\r\nroof rough boards covered with Paroid Roofing. There is a basement\r\nunder the whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47—Second story plan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48—Floor plan.]\r\n\r\nThe walls and ceiling of the entire lower floor are sheathed with hard\r\npine, a wooden partition separating the stalls from the carriages, and\r\nabundant windows give light and air to all parts. The ventilation of\r\nthe horse room is such that no gases reach the carriages, and “Hydrex”\r\nwaterproofing felt between the floorings of the carriage room cuts\r\nof the steam and gases from the manure pit. The iron gutter along\r\nthe rear of the stalls is covered with maple or birch plank, and the\r\nstall floors are either maple or birch. Running water is piped to the\r\nwater basin in the horse room, and a hose cock on the other side of\r\nthe partition receives the hose for washing carriages, or a revolving,\r\noverhead hose-fixture can be installed, just above the washing floor,\r\nif desired. A hot-water heater may be installed on the main floor, but\r\nbetter be in the basement, where the coal bin would be; radiators may\r\nbe set as desired, with one at least in rear of the box stall and one\r\non the carriage floor, and a small one in the man’s room on second\r\nfloor. The roof is drained by galvanized iron pipes emptying into blind\r\nwells. The carriage room floor is concreted, and a drain pipe leads\r\nfrom the depression where carriages are washed to a blind well. At one\r\nend is a platform for drying the bedding, and ventilation is so well\r\nprovided for there are almost no odors. As it is planned this is a\r\npractical, convenient, well-arranged stable, adapted to the needs of a\r\nfamily of moderate means on a suburban place.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMBINED HORSE AND COW STABLE\r\n\r\nAS DESIGNED FOR C. H. LINVILLE, ESQ., BALTIMORE, MD.\r\n\r\nDesiring a stable which would give him room for four cows, three horses\r\nand carriage room under one roof, Mr. C. H. Linville, of Baltimore,\r\nMd., wrote and asked about enlarging the plan of a stable for a\r\nsuburban place, and wished to place the carriage room at the other end\r\nof the stable, because the slope of the ground was such as to favor\r\ngetting the basement under that end in the location on which he desired\r\nto build; the result was a re-drawing of that plan and presenting it as\r\ngiven herewith. A comparison of these two plans will aid any intending\r\nbuilder to change and adapt to his especial purpose such plan as he\r\nprefers, but which may not be, as here presented, the best for him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49—A combined horse and cow stable.]\r\n\r\nThis stable is planned to be forty-eight feet long by twenty-five\r\nfeet wide, outside measure, and the space is so divided there is a\r\ngood seven by ten feet box stall and a good harness room in the horse\r\napartment; in the west end a grain room ten by twelve feet gives space\r\nfor four grain bins and the stairway up to loft opens out of this room.\r\nThe carriage room is sixteen by twenty-five feet, and the manure pit\r\nis in the basement beneath this room; to prevent the escape of ammonia\r\nfrom the manure pit into the carriage room a good cement floor should\r\nbe laid down.\r\n\r\nThis building is planned to be fourteen feet high to the plates and\r\ntwenty feet to the ridge, which gives liberal hay-lofts; should more\r\nhay space be thought desirable we would carry side walls to sixteen or\r\neighteen feet height, six feet, or even five feet of height from plates\r\nto ridge gives ample slope to roof where Paroid is the roof covering.\r\nAn ornamental cupola could easily be placed at the junction of the roof\r\nof the gable with the main roof, and would aid in the ventilation of\r\nthe hay-loft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50—Floor plan.]\r\n\r\nThe partitions between the different divisions and about the stalls\r\ngive ample opportunity for studs to be set to support the hay-loft\r\nfloor excepting in the clear span over the carriage room, and the floor\r\nstringers there should be doubly heavy to support the weight over so\r\nlarge a space. Another way to gain the desired strength here would\r\nbe to tie the roof-rafters securely and carry the strain on hangers\r\ndropped from the ridge; the three or four hangers necessary would\r\ninterfere but slightly with the hay storage space.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ATTRACTIVE DAIRY BARN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONT ELEVATION\r\n\r\nFIG. 51—An attractive dairy barn.]\r\n\r\nSometimes it is desired to have more attractive looking buildings than\r\nthe severely plain ones seen on many farms, and to illustrate the\r\ndecidedly attractive appearance which can be given to buildings which\r\nare covered with Paroid roofing, we have had prepared plans of a dairy\r\nbarn and a village stable, with the roofs treated with ornamental\r\nbattens and the whole roof painted with a dark green or red paint,\r\nwhich gives the rich effect of copper sheathing and is most pleasing to\r\nthe artistic eye. A cross-section of the battens we recommend are given\r\nhere. Paroid can be laid more rapidly when battens are used, and enough\r\nlabor is saved to pay for the slight extra cost of the battens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52. SIDE ELEVATION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53—Ornamental battens.]\r\n\r\nThe same idea may be carried out on the sides of all kinds of\r\nbuildings, and especially farm and poultry buildings, at a less expense\r\nthan clapboards and shingles. Parine Paint, which is made especially\r\nfor Paroid Roofing, is a dark brown and produces very neat results.\r\nParoid one-ply is the best weight for the sides and we would recommend\r\ntwo-ply for the roof.\r\n\r\nThis dairy barn is spread out extensively, instead of being built up\r\ninto the air, the front being eighty feet long by twenty-six feet wide,\r\nand there being two wings twenty feet wide extending forward thirty-two\r\nfeet, enclosing three sides of a quadrangle. A dairy room is set out in\r\nrear of the end containing the pens and yards for the bulls, and is\r\nconnected with the cow stable by a covered walk; this semi-detached\r\ndairy room avoids having the stable odors contaminating the milk, and\r\naids to cleanliness of dairy utensils by ample equipment for washing\r\nand refrigerating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. FIRST FLOOR PLAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55. SECOND FLOOR PLAN.]\r\n\r\nThe second floor of the main building is utilized for hay and grain\r\nstorage, and in one end are rooms for the stablemen, including a\r\nbath-room; this latter is a most important adjunct of a good dairy\r\nstable, it having been demonstrated that facilities for cleanness\r\npromotes cleanness, and absolute cleanness of men, animals, and all\r\nutensils is demanded in the up-to-date dairy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUBURBAN STABLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56—A suburban stable.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\nThe smaller stable, designed for a modest suburban residence, or\r\ncountry summer home, gives space for a pair of horses and three or four\r\ncows. It is planned to be built fifty-three feet long by thirty-three\r\nfeet wide, the end being planned to be the front, with a drive-way\r\nonto the main floor in the front. The hay is pitched into the storage\r\nloft through a trap-door in the ceiling, or, as some might prefer,\r\na hay-door could be set in place of the window over the drive-way\r\ndoors. The dormer windows and ornamental cupola combine with the\r\ncopper sheathing effect of the Paroid-covered roof to make a most\r\nattractive stable building and at comparatively moderate cost. If it\r\nwas desired this plan could be altered to give a more roomy hay-loft\r\nby adding either two or three feet to the length of the posts, and\r\ncorrespondingly flattening the roof, carrying the dormers very nearly\r\nout to the eaves. The added height of the posts could be added to the\r\nheight of the stable, keeping the roofs as steep as at present, if\r\npreferred, but it is one of the many advantages of Paroid covering for\r\na roof that the roof need have but slight pitch, when a shallow pitch\r\nis desired. The ground plan can be arranged differently; an improvement\r\nmight be to place the harness room where a calf-pen is indicated,\r\nmaking the space gained into a clothes and wash-room for the stableman.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLANK-FRAME BARN\r\n\r\nThe plank-frame barn has been very popular in several sections of\r\nthe country; the considerable saving in lumber and ease of building\r\nrecommending it to practical men. Less men and time are required to\r\nbuild one of these barns; they are stronger, the excellent “bracing” of\r\nthe frame making them effective to stand the pressure of hay and grain\r\nwithin or strong winds without.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58—A plank-frame barn.]\r\n\r\nIn some sections a solid frame foundation is used, in Maine the entire\r\nstructure is of plank; the barns are built either with or without\r\nbasement, according to the taste of the owner. A good, firmly built\r\nstone and cement foundation is advisable; with this foundation to rest\r\nthe plank upon the frame is raised. Do not be sparing of spikes, they\r\nare an essential feature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59—Cross-section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\nNo sills are used, and the upright studs take the place of posts. Two\r\nfor each post are set on the foundation on each side, between these is\r\nplaced and spiked the cross-plank, which extends the width of the barn\r\nand ties the two sides together. The scantlings on each side of barn\r\nfloor, forming center posts, are then raised and spiked in place. Upon\r\noutside of each upright is spiked a plank of same size as, and parallel\r\nwith, the first cross-plank; this gives three 2 × 8’s for cross sills\r\nthrough center of barn, each joint or band being fixed in this way.\r\nEnd joints, using boards instead of plank on outside, give the bedwork\r\nof the barn. At the sides, between uprights in place of sill, a plank\r\nis firmly spiked; this holds the uprights firmly in place and prevents\r\nworking sideways, while the thoroughly spiked cross planks prevent all\r\nmovement in other directions.\r\n\r\nSome barns are boarded diagonally, some horizontally; both methods give\r\nexcellent satisfaction. Many of these barns are built with a hip-roof,\r\nas in the illustration given, and these give a great amount of storage\r\nroom in the loft. The steeper single-slope roof gives equally good\r\nresults, looks well, and is a little more economical to build.\r\n\r\nParoid on roof and sides make it wind and waterproof.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRACTICAL SHEEP SHED\r\n\r\n(FROM A WISCONSIN FARM-INSTITUTE BULLETIN)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61—Perspective of sheds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62—Frame plan.]\r\n\r\nIt is in the nature of sheep to dislike dampness. In the pasture they\r\nwill fold at night always on the high and dry elevations. In selecting\r\nthe site of a sheep shed these facts should determine the choice of a\r\nsite that is drained and dry throughout the year. Dryness is one of the\r\nessentials of a good foundation for a healthy shed; second only to this\r\nin importance is the ventilation. Warm, close sheds mean the downfall\r\nof the sheep that are folded in them. A sheep is warm in body, as its\r\nblood temperature is high, and then the nature of the fleece is such\r\nas to be very retentive of the body’s heat. The cause of most failures\r\nto keep sheep profitably has been from housing them in warm, close\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the question of ventilation is the size of the\r\nshed. The amount of room required by a sheep will vary considerably,\r\nranging from ten square feet for the Merino and Southdown to fifteen\r\nsquare feet for the larger breeds, including the Cotswolds and larger\r\nDowns. It is not advisable to crowd breeding ewes into a small area.\r\nThe crowding is most injurious when it results from restricted room at\r\nthe feeding rack and when it occurs through narrow doors. A breeding\r\newe weighing one hundred and fifty pounds will require fully one and\r\none-quarter feet of space at the fodder rack.\r\n\r\nA desirable attribute of a shed is the entrance of sunlight; this\r\nparticularly encourages the growth of the lambs, and it is to them that\r\nthe shed will do the most good. To further the entrance of sunlight\r\nthe windows should be higher than they are wide, which will materially\r\nassist in diffusing the rays over the greatest amount of inside space.\r\nIn addition to these a shed should be large enough to supply storage\r\nspace for sufficient fodder to feed the sheep while they must be\r\nsheltered. Estimating that a ton of hay requires five hundred cubic\r\nfeet, and that a sheep will not eat over three pounds of hay per day,\r\nit would require about one hundred and twenty-five cubic feet of space\r\nto contain the hay needed to maintain a sheep during six months. There\r\nshould also be room available for a root cellar and for the storage of\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65. Rack for inside feeding.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67. Rack for outside feeding.]\r\n\r\nThe plan here given is of a building forty feet wide and sixty feet\r\nlong. It has two stories, the first being nine feet high and the\r\nsecond six feet from the floor to the eaves. It is advisable to make\r\nthe height of the lower story nine feet to secure the best results in\r\nventilation. The sills are six by eight inches, resting preferably\r\non stone foundation, and if set on posts they should be heavier. The\r\nground both on the inside and outside should come close to the sills,\r\nso that no obstruction is offered by the sills to the free passage of\r\nthe sheep through the doors. The doors are all four feet wide, and\r\nthose that are used by the sheep should be sliding; the windows are\r\nthree feet wide and four and one-half feet high. In the center of the\r\nsheep apartment there are double doors ten feet wide. When both are\r\nopened and the center post removed a wagon can be driven through to\r\nremove the manure from the pens.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the lower floor has been adjusted so as to give\r\nthe sheep the smallest amount of space and yet have easily accessible\r\nfeed racks that would give sufficient room to the sheep for feeding.\r\nThe feed racks are all permanent, as there is no necessity for their\r\nremoval, and they form a wall for the passage way which runs through\r\nthe center. In this way it is easy to put hay in them, and it is very\r\neasy to put grain into the troughs in front of them. As will be seen in\r\nthe ground plan there are two chutes at each end, down which the hay is\r\nthrown from the loft. From where it falls it is easily distributed into\r\nall the racks.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOG HOUSES\r\n\r\n(ADAPTED FROM BULLETIN NO. 109. ILLINOIS EXPERIMENT STATION.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68—Individual hog house.]\r\n\r\n_Individual Houses._—Individual hog houses, or “cots,” as they\r\nare sometimes called, are built in many different ways. Some are built\r\nwith four upright walls and a shed roof, each of which (the walls and\r\nroof) being a separate piece can easily be taken down and replaced,\r\nmaking the moving of these small houses to another location an easy\r\nmatter. Others are built with two sides sloping in towards the top so\r\nas to form the roof, as shown in Fig. 68. These are built on skids\r\nand when necessary can be moved as a whole by being drawn by a horse.\r\nThey are built in several different styles: some have a window in the\r\nfront end above the door, while all may have a small door in the rear\r\nend, near the apex, for ventilating purposes. These houses are built\r\nin different sizes; indeed, there are about as many different forms of\r\ncots as there are individuals using them.\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favor of this type of house for swine are that each\r\nsow at farrowing time may be kept alone and away from all disturbance;\r\nthat each litter of pigs may be kept and fed by itself, consequently\r\nthere will not be too large a number of pigs in a common lot; that\r\nthese houses may be placed at the farther end of the feed lot, thus\r\ncompelling the sow and pigs to take exercise, especially in winter,\r\nwhen they come to the feed trough at the front end of the lot; that the\r\ndanger of spreading disease among a herd is at a minimum; and in case\r\nthe place occupied by the cot becomes unsanitary it may be removed to a\r\nclean location.\r\n\r\n_Large Houses._—Individual hog houses have certain advantages in\r\ntheir favor, and large houses, if properly planned and built, have many\r\npoints of advantage; among them being good sanitation, serviceability,\r\nsafety in farrowing, ease in handling hogs, and large pastures\r\ninvolving little expense for fences. In order to be sanitary a hog\r\nhouse should admit the direct rays of the sun to the floor of all the\r\npens and exclude cold drafts in winter, be dry, free from dust, well\r\nventilated, and exclude the hot sun during the summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69—Large hog house.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations show a hog house built with this purpose in view. The\r\nbuilding is one hundred and twenty feet long by thirty feet wide, and\r\nhas an eight-foot alley running lengthwise through the middle, between\r\nthe two rows of pens. It stands lengthwise east and west with the\r\nwindows on the south side, the windows being so placed that at noon\r\nof the shortest day of the year, the rays of sunlight passing through\r\nthe upper part will fall upon the floor of the south side pen on the\r\nopposite side from the window. This allows the total amount of light\r\ncoming through the window at this season of the year and at this time\r\nof the day to fall upon the floor within the pen; consequently, during\r\nthe latter winter months, there will be a maximum amount of sunlight\r\non the floor of the pen; the window in the upper part of the building\r\nperforms the same function for the pen on the north side of the alley.\r\nBy this arrangement of windows there is possible a maximum amount of\r\nsunlight on the floor of the pens in winter, which will serve to warm\r\nthe interior of the house, and especially the beds, during the latter\r\nmonths of winter, thus making it possible to have pigs farrowed very\r\nearly in the season. Sunlight not only warms and dries the building,\r\nbut destroys disease germs, thus making the building both warm and\r\nsanitary.\r\n\r\nThe upper window, which throws light into the pen on the north side is\r\nlong, and this necessitates a flat roof for the part of the building\r\nsouth of the alley, which must necessarily be covered with some\r\nmaterial, such as Paroid Roofing, that will shed water at a slight\r\npitch. Dryness should be secured by thorough drainage, freedom from\r\ndust by sprinkling with water, and the direct sunlight should be\r\nprevented from entering the pens during the hot part of the summer\r\ndays; this is done by the manner of constructing the building—the\r\nlower window is shaded by the eaves and the rays passing through the\r\nupper windows fall upon the floor of the alley.\r\n\r\nIn order to be most serviceable a hog house should be constructed so\r\nthat it can be used every day in the year. In order to be an economizer\r\nof labor the house should be planned so that the largest amount of\r\nwork may be performed with the smallest amount of labor, which, with\r\nthe present scarcity of labor, is a very important factor. Farrowing\r\npens should be supplied with fenders, which prevent the sows crushing\r\nthe pigs, and should be built so the attendant may lend assistance, if\r\nnecessary, with both convenience and safety. By having all the hogs\r\nunder one roof handling becomes simpler, and in case of bad weather\r\nmuch more convenient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70—Ground plan.]\r\n\r\nThe alley through the middle of the building is eight feet wide; this\r\npermits driving through the building with a wagon, which allows the\r\nbedding to be hauled directly to the pens, and the manure to be loaded\r\non the wagon directly from the pens and hauled to the fields. The pens\r\nare ten feet wide and eleven feet deep. Each pen has a slide door\r\nopening to the outside, and a door opening to the alley; the latter is\r\nhung so that when it is opened it will turn the pigs towards the front\r\nend of the house, for weighing, etc. It also permits changing pigs\r\nfrom one pen to another, and gives easy access to the attendant. The\r\ntrough is placed on the side of the pen next the alley, and a swinging\r\npanel above the trough, shown in the illustration of the interior,\r\nmakes feeding a very easy and convenient operation. The “fender” is\r\nshown in the ground plan, and consists of a two-inch iron pipe placed\r\non posts of the same set in concrete in the floor. This fender should\r\nbe placed eight or nine inches above the floor and about six inches\r\nfrom the wall, it is to prevent the sows crushing the pigs at farrowing\r\ntime; the sow will necessarily make her bed in this corner as the other\r\nthree corners are occupied, two of them by doors and the other the feed\r\ntrough.\r\n\r\nThere is a four-inch drain tile laid from each pen to the main lines\r\non either side, which are placed on the outside of the pens, leading\r\noff down the ravine. The tile opens up through the floor of the pens\r\nby means of a perforated iron disk, which is laid in the bell-end of a\r\nlength of sewer pipe. The floor is made to slope toward the drain so\r\nthat it can be flushed with water.\r\n\r\nAll the gates and partitions of the interior are made of wire netting\r\npanels. Wire is better than lumber for this purpose, for several\r\nreasons. They are no obstruction to light, the rays of light coming\r\nthrough the windows are not cut off from reaching the floor, where they\r\nare most needed; they keep the floor and bedding warm and disinfected.\r\nIn case the hog house should become infected with disease germs it can\r\nbe flushed out and disinfected much more easily and thoroughly. Wire\r\npartitions allow the hogs always to be in sight of each other and of\r\nthe attendant. By this means the sows, when they are shut up to farrow,\r\nwill not become estranged from one another, and will not be so likely\r\nto fight after returning to a common pasture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71—Large hog house—interior.]\r\n\r\nA hog house built and operated according to the above outlined plan\r\nmakes it possible to perform a maximum amount of work with a minimum\r\namount of labor, and to put the pigs on the market at seasons of the\r\nyear that are out of the ordinary; it can be expected that pigs thus\r\nmarketed will sell for higher prices than those that are marketed along\r\nwith the general supply.\r\n\r\n_The Question of Space._—A question which most frequently comes\r\nto the front is: “How much room is required for a horse, cow, hen,\r\netc.?” and there is no one question about which there is greater\r\ndifference of opinion. A good size of horse stall is four feet wide\r\nby nine feet long, and a good size of cow stall is three feet wide\r\nby five feet long; of course these dimensions taking no account of\r\ngutter-space at rear of stalls for catching the manure. Another good\r\ndairyman will tell us that he wants his cow stalls four feet wide,\r\nand will present strong arguments in favor of the greater amount of\r\nroom; it is obvious that twenty-five per cent. increase of width of\r\nstalls decidedly increases the space-cost per cow. The best testimony,\r\nhowever, is in favor of being liberal in space, as, for example, is\r\nsaid about the sheep sheds: “Crowding is most injurious when it results\r\nfrom restricted room at the feeding rack and when it occurs through\r\nnarrow doors. A breeding ewe weighing one hundred and fifty pounds will\r\nrequire fully one and one-quarter feet of space at the fodder rack.”\r\n\r\nThe same suggestion applies to floor space per hen. It has been\r\ndemonstrated that it is unprofitable to crowd fowls too much, and\r\nwell known writers have urged that ten square feet of floor space be\r\ngiven to each bird; in practice, however, very much less space per\r\nbird gives good results in health of flocks and average egg-product.\r\nIn the scratching-shed plan of house, on pages 18 and 19, the floor\r\nspace is recommended as seven and one-fifth square feet per bird with\r\ntwenty-five fowls of the American varieties per pen, and six square\r\nfeet each with thirty birds of one of the Mediterranean varieties per\r\npen. In the Gowell Poultry Farm house, on pages 16 and 17, four square\r\nfeet of floor space is allotted to each bird, and it is the plan there\r\nto keep the birds wholly confined to the pens for the five cold months.\r\nThese illustrations show that there is wide range in actual practice,\r\nbut we believe it is wise to allow at least five to six square feet of\r\nfloor space to each fowl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAROID ROOFING\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Partial View of Our Mills on the Neponset River at East\r\nWalpole, Mass. Paroid is Made from Start to Finish Right in Our Own\r\nMills.]\r\n\r\nOur products are for the man who is planning new buildings, or about to\r\nmake repairs to old ones; and we have tried to tell in the following\r\nparagraphs how each one of our materials is particularly adapted to\r\nthe different kinds of work for which it is made. Our claims are\r\nbased on actual experiences and if you are in the market for roofing\r\nor sheathing papers, you will find that our materials will save you\r\nmoney. First of all, we are going to tell you about our Paroid Roofing,\r\nbecause the roof is one of the most important parts of every building.\r\nIf it is not right, there is no end of trouble.\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFICULTIES OF CHOOSING A GOOD ROOF. There are about thirty\r\ndifferent brands of ready roofing, and for most of them the same claims\r\nare made. Under those conditions, how are you going to choose the one\r\nthat will prove most economical for you? There is only one test that\r\nwill tell, and that is the test of time. Of course you can’t make that\r\ntest yourself, but it is for your interests to find out if others have\r\nmade it and for how long.\r\n\r\nThe most economical roofing is not the one that costs you the least per\r\nroll when you buy it, but the roofing that costs you least per year of\r\nservice. We are going to tell you here the most important facts about\r\nParoid; how it compares with shingles, metal and other kinds of ready\r\nroofing, and then you can be your own judge.\r\n\r\nPAROID vs. TIN AND IRON ROOFS. The best quality of tin, iron and steel\r\nroofings cost much more than Paroid at the start, and then there is\r\nalways the additional cost of painting each year. In spite of all you\r\ncan do, a metal roof will rust out and spring leaks which cannot be\r\npermanently repaired. Paroid cannot rust; it costs less than metal\r\nroofs when you buy it, and less to apply. Anyone can lay Paroid. One\r\nexample that proves the superiority of Paroid over metal roofs was\r\nshown when the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad, who had tried different\r\nkinds of roofing on their Chicago train sheds, including a good tin\r\nroof, used Paroid when the tin roof failed. The Paroid Roofing is still\r\nin good condition.\r\n\r\nPAROID vs. SHINGLES. If you have recently asked your lumber dealer for\r\na price on shingles, you are probably looking for a substitute because\r\nof the exorbitant price asked for them. Lumber is scarce everywhere,\r\nand shingles are growing poorer in quality and higher in price every\r\nday. The test of time has proved that Paroid is the real substitute for\r\nshingles, and it has many advantages which shingles do not have. Figure\r\nthis out for yourself. The first cost of Paroid is less than that of a\r\nmedium grade of shingles. You can lay Paroid yourself and it requires\r\nan experienced man to lay shingles. Shingles catch fire easily, while\r\nParoid is practically fireproof against sparks, cinders and embers.\r\n\r\nRead what a large lumber dealer in Maine says about the comparative\r\ncost of shingles and Paroid Roofing. He is right in the heart of the\r\nshingle belt, and naturally the difference is not so great as in other\r\nsections of the country where shingles are not so plentiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colony chicken houses on farm of G. M. Gowell, of the\r\nMaine Agricultural Experiment Station, Orono, Maine. The roofs are\r\ncovered with PAROID, sides with NEPONSET.\r\n\r\nSee plans and description on page 17.]\r\n\r\nOne-ply Paroid, which is usually heavy enough for the roof and sides of\r\nmost farm and poultry buildings, will save you at least 35% over the\r\ncost of shingles. Here are the figures showing the comparative cost of\r\none-ply Paroid and B. C. Cedar Shingles.\r\n\r\n    Clear cedar shingles per square        $3.10\r\n    4 lbs. nails at 3¢ per lb.               .12\r\n    Average cost of carpenter labor         1.25  4.47\r\n                                           ———\r\n    Cost per square foot             45¢\r\n\r\n    1-ply Paroid per square                $2.50\r\n    Laying                                   .35  2.85\r\n                                           ———\r\n    Cost per square foot            28½¢\r\n\r\nLumber dealers all over the United States and Canada who previously\r\nsold shingles exclusively, now sell large quantities of Paroid Roofing.\r\nThat tells the whole story.\r\n\r\nIn the core of each roll of Paroid sufficient nails, rust-proof caps,\r\ncement, and complete directions for applying are packed. You can lay\r\nit yourself with a hammer and knife. One-ply Paroid, costing about one\r\nhalf as much as shingles, is heavy enough for most farm and poultry\r\nbuildings. For barns, stables, and other large buildings we recommend\r\ntwo-ply, which is heavier and thicker.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAROID _vs._ OTHER READY ROOFINGS\r\n\r\nThere are certain qualities that all ready roofings must have, but the\r\nimportant question is, How long do they keep these qualities? We have\r\nmade our story short, but at the same time complete enough, so that you\r\ncan be your own judge when you compare our claims for Paroid with the\r\nclaims of other manufacturers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A hog house on a Vermont farm, covered with PAROID.]\r\n\r\nREADY ROOFING EXPERIENCE. You have probably read the advertisements of\r\nsome manufacturers who claim that because they have had fifty to one\r\nhundred years’ experience (in some business or other), that they\r\nmake the best ready roofing. We have been making felt, paper and\r\nroofing materials here in our own mills for nearly one hundred years\r\n(established in 1817) but WE REFUSE TO CLAIM that the length of time we\r\nhave been established has anything to do with the real merit of Paroid\r\nRoofing. It shows only that we have had the right kind of experience.\r\nWe maintain that the test of time is the only real test of a roofing.\r\nParoid has stood this test.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paroid covers the Plant Industry Buildings, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nTHE OLD CRY OF THE IMITATORS. Most manufacturers warn you against\r\n“imitations” of their “genuine” ready roofing. Investigate, and\r\nyou’ll find that the imitators themselves are the first to talk about\r\nimitations. The question of imitations has nothing to do with the\r\nmerits of a particular roofing. Some imitations are often better than\r\nthe originals; but there is only one way to prove it—the test of time\r\nis the test that tells. Paroid has stood this test.\r\n\r\nPAROID IS MADE BETTER THAN OTHER READY ROOFINGS. There are three\r\nimportant things that enter into the manufacture of ready roofing;\r\nnamely, the felt, saturation and the coating.\r\n\r\nWe make the felt for Paroid Roofing in our own mills because we could\r\nnot entrust to others the making of the most important part of Paroid.\r\nIf the felt is not right the roofing will not be. Do not run risks. Buy\r\nyour roofing from manufacturers who make their own felt.\r\n\r\nSATURATION AND COATING. The strong, well-made Paroid Roofing felt is\r\nsoaked, not merely dipped, in a compound of our own, rendering every\r\nfibre of it absolutely proof against water, cold and heat. The felt is\r\nthen given a thicker, smoother and more pliable coating than that on\r\nany other ready roofing. Compare samples and you will see and feel the\r\ndifference. It is more flexible in cold, and it will not melt or run\r\nin the heat. It is more sightly, and lays easier and smoother than any\r\nother ready roofing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roof of Brooder house, covered with PAROID, White\r\nLeghorn Poultry Yards, Waterville, N. Y. See plan and description on\r\npage 12.]\r\n\r\nWE WERE THE ORIGINATORS OF THE COMPLETE ROOFING KIT\r\n\r\nInside of each roll of Paroid is packed cement, nails, rust-proof caps,\r\nand complete directions for applying. Anyone can lay Paroid and get\r\ngood results if the directions are carefully followed.\r\n\r\nOUR PATENTED RUST RETARDING CAPS\r\n\r\nParoid is the only ready roofing supplied with rust retarding caps for\r\napplying the roofing to a building. They are square, and therefore,\r\nhave more binding surface than the ordinary round caps. The nails are\r\nalso coated with a rust retarding preparation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Largest stock barn on the largest stock farm in\r\nMinnesota. Eight hundred squares of PAROID put on roof of this barn by\r\nthe farm hands themselves.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPAROID FOR FARM AND POULTRY BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nParoid is adapted to all kinds of buildings and especially farm and\r\npoultry buildings. It makes a building warmer in winter and cooler in\r\nsummer than other kinds of roofing. It will not taint rain water and is\r\nnot affected by gases and fumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAROID FOR SIDING\r\n\r\nThe next time you put up a poultry house, shed, or other farm building,\r\nlay Paroid on the roof yourself, and then apply it to the sides with\r\nbattens. You will be surprised at the neat effect it gives, and it is\r\nmore economical than clapboards and shingles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR GUARANTEE\r\n\r\nYou run no risks when you buy Paroid. Every roll is sold on this\r\nguarantee.\r\n\r\nBuy a roll of Paroid; open it; examine it; apply it to your roof; and\r\nthen, if you are not satisfied that you have the best ready roofing on\r\nthe market, send us your name and address and we will send you a check\r\nfor the full amount you have paid for the roofing, including the cost\r\nof applying it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D. J. Lambert says, “PAROID is all right;” and he knows.]\r\n\r\nOur dealers all over the country who handle Paroid will also make you\r\nthis offer. If your dealer does not carry Paroid in stock, send us your\r\norder and check or money order direct. We will pay the freight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bird’s-eye View of Egg Plant. W. Harry Owen’s Farm,\r\nVineyard Haven, Mass. All buildings are covered with PAROID.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES\r\n\r\nYou can pay most any price for a ready roofing, and, like everything\r\nelse, you get as much quality as you pay for. Paroid may cost more than\r\nother ready roofings the day you buy it, but it is less expensive after\r\nit is applied to your roof, because it will last longer. We maintain\r\nthat the test of time is the test that tells, and Paroid has stood that\r\ntest. Don’t make a mistake and buy a roofing that will go to pieces in\r\na short time. If you would save money, choose the roofing that lasts\r\nthe longest.\r\n\r\nPRICE LIST\r\n\r\n    Paroid Roofing, 1-ply, $2.50 per square (100 sq. ft.).\r\n    Paroid Roofing, 2-ply, $3.50 per square (100 sq. ft.).\r\n\r\nThese prices include extra roofing for laps and nails, rust-proof caps,\r\ncement, and directions for applying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Meadow Brook Farm poultry plant, Dallas, Pa.

It must not be compared with tarred felts just\r\nbecause it costs about the same. Neponset will usually outlast them\r\nthree to one.\r\n\r\nNeponset won’t run and dry out like tarred felts. It is easier to apply\r\nand cleaner to handle.\r\n\r\nFigure it out for yourself. A tarred felt costing the same as Neponset\r\nlasts only a few seasons. Neponset lasts at least from five to seven\r\nyears and in most cases longer. If you are going to use a low cost\r\nroofing, Neponset will save you money.\r\n\r\nNeponset makes a practically permanent siding, and if Paroid is too\r\nexpensive for both roof and sides, we recommend Paroid for the roof and\r\nNeponset for the sides.\r\n\r\nNeponset is put up in rolls 36 inches wide, containing, 100, 250 and\r\n500 square feet. Fixtures and directions for applying Neponset are\r\npacked inside of each roll.\r\n\r\nNEPONSET BLACK WATERPROOF PAPER is made especially for sheathing\r\npurposes, but it will last a year or two on the roof or sides of\r\nbuildings. It costs less and is cleaner to handle than tarred felts.\r\nNeponset Black is put up in rolls 36 inches wide containing 250 and 500\r\nsquare feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPONSET WATERPROOF SHEATHING PAPER\r\n\r\nOne of the most important items that every house builder ought to\r\nconsider is that of sheathing papers. This important question, unless\r\ndecided right, means an additional expense of many dollars in fuel\r\neach year. Sheathing papers are used to keep out cold and dampness,\r\nbut only a few fulfill their purpose. Cold draughts penetrate cheap\r\npapers, and in a very short time these cheap papers disintegrate and\r\nbecome mere dust. A good waterproof paper repels dampness, keeps\r\nout the cold and lasts the life of a building. For over twenty-five\r\nyears Neponset Papers have been the standard. Actual experiences have\r\nproved that Neponset saves one-third of the fuel required to heat a\r\nhouse, therefore, a big saving each year. Neponset acts as a blanket\r\non a house it keeps out the cold and keeps in the heat. Don’t lay the\r\nfoundations for an annual loss, save one-third of the money you would\r\nspend on fuel. That’s what Neponset has done for others, it will do it\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bird’s-eye View of Chas. F. Thompson & Co.’s Poultry\r\nPlant, Lynnfield Centre, Mass.

I am\r\n    sending you a catalogue showing views we have half-tone\r\n    plates for. If they will do I can loan them to you.\r\n    The original photographs are lost. The long buildings\r\n    shown, bird’s-eye view are covered with Neponset, put\r\n    on nearly ten years ago; one coat of paint put on at\r\n    the time, nothing done since and not a leak; appear in\r\n    good condition now.

Hope that you will\r\n    also send some with Paroid as we find, in many cases,\r\n    customers prefer to pay the difference.\r\n\r\n      One of our roofs, about twelve hundred square feet,\r\n    was covered with Red Rope some ten years ago.

Other\r\n    kinds of roofing which we paid more money for do not\r\n    seem to have given us the service that this has. We\r\n    ask you to kindly advise us what is the best paint to\r\n    repaint this with, and which is the best season of the\r\n    year to use same.\r\n                              Yours very truly,\r\n                                     BADGER LUMBER CO.,\r\n                          (_Signed_) L.

BIRD & SON,\r\n          East Walpole, Mass.\r\n\r\n      _Gentlemen_: Will you please send me sample of\r\n    sidings and roofings, and also prices? I want to get\r\n    Neponset unless you have got something better. Neponset\r\n    beats anything of the kind I ever used.\r\n\r\n                                  Yours truly,\r\n                                      W. E.

Roof is covered with\r\nNEPONSET.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSLATE ROOFING AND SIDING\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENTED MAY 13, 1906\r\n\r\nDESIGNED ESPECIALLY FOR PITCH ROOF HOUSES AND FOR A PERMANENT SIDING\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION. Proslate is our regular Paroid roofing material with an\r\nadditional wearing surface (not a colored coating) of a mixture of\r\npaint and sand, making a _slate-like_ surface, _slate_ in\r\ncolor and effect. Proslate is an entirely new material—patented.\r\n\r\nFOR PITCH ROOFS. Proslate is especially designed to take the place of\r\nshingles and clapboards for residences. Attractiveness and economy\r\nare both secured by using Proslate for pitch roofs. It is finished in\r\n18-inch rolls, ready to lay, with ornamented edge.\r\n\r\nProslate is applied in the usual way—lapped, cemented and nailed—no\r\nwaste by excessive overlapping—cement and fixtures of same slate color\r\nwith complete directions for laying are packed in each roll. Any good\r\ncarpenter can apply it.\r\n\r\nProslate is finished in rolls containing 122 square feet, sufficient\r\nto cover 100 square feet of surface and is sold on a basis of material\r\nenough to cover 100 square feet.\r\n\r\nFOR FLAT ROOFS AND SIDING. For flat roofs and as a siding, we furnish\r\nProslate in rolls 36 inches wide, plain straight edges. By the use of\r\nbroad cleats, a very neat effect can be made on the sides of houses.\r\nProslate for a siding is warmer than clapboards or shingles. It acts as\r\na blanket.\r\n\r\nGENERAL USE. As a permanent all round roof, we believe that Proslate\r\nrepresents the best material for the money yet made. It is good\r\nenough for residences, factories and railroad buildings. Shingles are\r\nunsatisfactory and cannot be used on flat roofs, porches, etc., and\r\nslate is too expensive. Proslate fills every requirement of a good\r\nroofing, well made with an extra weather surface, economical—permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORIAN SOUND-DEADENING FELT\r\n\r\n\r\nThis material is used between floors as an insulator against sound.\r\nIt is, without any exception, the cleanest and most effective\r\nsound-deadening felt made. The corrugations make small dead air cells\r\nwhen the felt is placed in position and this is considered to be the\r\nmost effective method of deadening sound. Tests have proved that one\r\nsheet of Florian is equal to six sheets of ordinary deadening felt.\r\nFlorian is also a good non-conductor of fire, heat and cold. It should\r\nbe used between floors in every house to insure a well insulated\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER THINGS WE MAKE\r\n\r\nWe make Neponset and Kosat Insulating Papers for cold storage work;\r\nParine Paint, especially for our own roofings, and all kinds of outside\r\nwork; Tack, Screw, and Shoe boxes, all kinds of special papers and\r\npaper boxes.\r\n\r\nWe have had a large experience with all kinds of building and roofing\r\nconstruction, and if we can help you on any of your problems please be\r\nsure to write us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                       F.
