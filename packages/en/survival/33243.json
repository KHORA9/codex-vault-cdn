Many residents of the Herndon area shared\r\ntheir personal memories and offered really old-fashioned Virginia\r\nhospitality to those doing research. Without the help of Neal Bailey,\r\nElizabeth Ellmore, Emma Ellmore, Virginia Greear, Holden Harrison, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Ray Harrison, Margaret Mary Lee, Edna Middleton, John\r\nMiddleton, Rebecca Middleton, Richard Peck, Elizabeth Rice, Louise\r\nRyder, and Mary Scott, this monograph could not have been completed.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention must be made of retired County Agricultural Extension\r\nAgent Joseph Beard, who shared his detailed knowledge of county\r\nagricultural practices on numerous occasions. He willingly arranged\r\ninterviews with county farmers, and often helped to break the ice by\r\naccompanying the interviewer. This was always done with abundant good\r\nhumor and his enthusiasm was infectious. I am also particularly grateful\r\nto Dr. John T. Schlebecker of the Extractive Industries Division of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. His expertise in the field of agricultural\r\ntechnology and special interest in living historical farms added\r\nsignificantly to the quality of the monograph. Additional thanks go to\r\nAnthony Pryor of the Rockefeller Foundation who read this paper and\r\nhelped to put its conclusions in perspective with trends of agricultural\r\neconomics.\r\n\r\nNan Netherton originally conceived the project and did much of the\r\ninitial groundwork. The majority of interviews with Floris area farmers\r\nwere conducted by her. Mrs. Netherton's reputation in the county made it\r\npossible for us both to acquire private papers and photographs which\r\nmight otherwise have been overlooked or withheld. What is more, she\r\nsympathetically \"initiated\" me into the project, offering suggestions\r\nand constructive aid without discouraging my own ideas about the\r\ndirection the study should take.\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth Brown Pryor\r\n  Fairfax, Virginia\r\n  June 21, 1979\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1925 Fairfax County was still predominantly rural in character.\r\nFarmers occupied over half of the county's land, living on individual\r\nholdings which averaged 62.5 acres. Nearly 85% of these farmers were\r\nwhite and of this group only 15% did not own their own farm. They shared\r\ntheir domain with 3,605 horses, 11,636 head of cattle, 5,408 swine,\r\n171,526 chickens and 178 mules. One-tenth of the farms enjoyed the use\r\nof a tractor and 25% had a radio. The average capital holding on land\r\nand buildings was $8,229, and the Fairfax County farmer netted something\r\nless than $1,000 income annually.[1]\r\n\r\nThese figures give a skeleton picture of Fairfax County's most prominent\r\ncitizen in the period between the two World Wars; when the statistics\r\nare translated in prose, his shadowy form gains weight. The farmer at\r\nthis time was a small landowner, possessing a farm only as large as his\r\nown family and a few hired laborers could manage. Although his capital\r\nholdings were not huge, they were well above the state average. He had\r\nthe prestige of being a homeowner, and the pride of working his own\r\nsoil, perhaps the same soil his grandparents had tilled. The rural\r\nfamily raised livestock for their own use, but principally for the\r\nmarket, and favored draft horses over tractors, mules or oxen to power\r\nfarm equipment. This farmer's time was spent on a myriad of duties and\r\ndetails--his function was not yet totally specialized--ranging from\r\nbutchering hogs to building chicken coops to thinning corn. He worked\r\nfor himself, planning the day's activities, relying on his own judgment\r\nand initiative to cope with the varying responsibilities he shouldered.\r\nHis numerical prominence gave him political and social leverage. It was\r\nthe rural way of life that shaped the county and his demands which\r\nneeded to be met.\r\n\r\nAt first glance this farmer's life seems tempered by nature and largely\r\nself-contained. The daily routine was established by seasons and\r\nsunlight; fortunes were made or lost at the mercy of the wind and rain.\r\nA farm was not only the farmer's livelihood and workshop but his home.\r\nThus, unlike the city worker whose occupation was entirely separate from\r\nhome concerns, country life had a total integration.[2] Moreover, the\r\nfamily farmer possessed a sense of continuity with the long tradition of\r\nthe small landowner in America. In many respects his life was little\r\nchanged from that of the thrifty, energetic and shrewd subsistence\r\nfarmer whom Thomas Jefferson had praised in the eighteenth century as\r\nthe ideal citizen of a democracy.[3]\r\n\r\nIn both startling and subtle ways, however, the traditional role of the\r\nfamily farmer was changing in the 1920s and 1930s. In Ellen Glasgow's\r\nnovel _Barren Ground_, which examines the uncertainties of life on a\r\nnorthern Virginia dairy farm, the heroine, Dorinda Oakley, describes her\r\nemotional and economic reaction to the post World War I period:\r\n\r\n     With the return of peace she hoped that the daily life on the farm\r\n     would slip back into orderly grooves; but before the end of the\r\n     first year she discovered that the demoralization of peace was more\r\n     difficult to combat than the madness of war. There was no longer an\r\n     ecstatic patriotism to inspire one to fabulous exploits. The world\r\n     that had been organized for destruction appeared to her to become\r\n     as completely disorganized for folly.... The excessive wages paid\r\n     for unskilled labour were ruinous to the farmer, for the field\r\n     hands who had earned six dollars a day from the Government were not\r\n     satisfied to drive a plough for the small sum that had enabled her\r\n     to reclaim the abandoned meadows of five oaks.... She was using two\r\n     tractor-ploughs on the farm; but the roads were almost impassable\r\n     again because none of the negroes could be persuaded to work on\r\n     them. Even when she employed men to repair the strip of \"corduroy\"\r\n     road between the bridge and the fork, it was impossible to keep the\r\n     bad places firm enough for any car heavier than a Ford to travel\r\n     over them....[4]\r\n\r\nThus, social and technical advances that had long been desired in rural\r\nareas bolstered the farmer's optimism. Yet curiously enough this same\r\nprogress often jarred his expectations and financial security. Improved\r\nroads meant improved markets, and increased contact with outside\r\ncommunities but, along with the advent of the radio, they resulted in a\r\nhomogenizing of city and country ways, and lured many away from the\r\nfarm. Concern for rural welfare prompted all levels of government to\r\ndesign programs to aid the farmer--programs which indeed furthered\r\nagriculture, but at the price of well-meaning interference in a\r\npreviously highly individual sphere. Amid regulations and forms the\r\nfarmer felt a nagging loss of independence. Perhaps most strikingly,\r\nwidespread use of gasoline-powered equipment changed the pace of work,\r\nmade him reliant on outside sources for fuel and parts, and involved\r\ninvestments which often prohibited purchase or encouraged\r\nspecialization.\r\n\r\nHence, the family farm retained its size and shape but it could no\r\nlonger revel in complete self-reliance.\r\n\r\nThe model farm at Frying Pan Park is a representation of this changing\r\nway of life. It recognizes especially the role of the family subsistence\r\nfarmer and his contributions to the economy and solidarity of Fairfax\r\nCounty's rural communities. Although this study focuses on the\r\ninstitutions and personalities of the Floris-Herndon area, it is meant\r\nto be generic in scope. Dairying, which forms one emphasis of this\r\nmonograph, was widespread in the area, and though each district had its\r\ndistinctive elements, the underlying social values and farming methods\r\nwere consistent throughout the county. In essence, Frying Pan Farm works\r\nmuch as a snapshot would to recall an important phase in Fairfax\r\nCounty's history. It gives a brief glance at a world we have lost, but\r\nwhich lingers significantly in the region's memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n_Introduction_\r\n\r\n[1] _United States Census of Agriculture, 1925, Statistics for Virginia_\r\n(Washington.

He was accustomed to a world in which his occupation and\r\nsocial status were assured, and childhood experience probably led him to\r\nassume the farmer's role naturally. The rhythms of farm life were based\r\non the immutable round of the seasons. Each day's sun and wind pulled\r\nthe tiller in its direction as did the unceasing need to tame the growth\r\nand habits of beasts and land. Nature was the farmer's clock, and though\r\nhe bid the land to produce what he desired, it was the earth which fixed\r\nhis hours and chores. From this close association with nature came a\r\ncontinuity and special bond between farmers, which defied both time and\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAlthough the early years of the 20th century heralded a new era of\r\nspecialization in agriculture, the farmers of Fairfax County persisted\r\nin executing the varied functions of general farming. Dairying might be\r\nthe emphasis on many farms, but it was rarely pursued at the expense of\r\nproduction of grain or food for home consumption. Variety continued to\r\nbe an important quality of farm work. Families on large and specialized\r\nfarms still did chores similar to those done by subsistence farmers,\r\nthough the amount of time allotted for each task might differ. The\r\nrelentlessness of certain activities, such as feeding the stock, was the\r\nsame whether the farm boasted one cow or fifty. Thus distinctions\r\nbetween general and specialized farmers were not so clear-cut in this\r\nperiod. The following pages detail the work done on a small dairy farm,\r\nyet the kinds and methods of activities also pertain to the farmer whose\r\nacreage was devoted solely to general farming.\r\n\r\nPerpetuity--a continual need to perform certain tasks and watch over\r\nspecific events on a daily basis--was the most fundamental aspect of\r\nfarming. The farmer's day began with such an interminable chore: milking\r\nthe cows. This twice-daily task was, of course, particularly important\r\non dairy farms and its relentlessness is often the first aspect to be\r\nmentioned in any farming recollection. \"When you have dairy cows,\"\r\nJoseph Beard, who grew up in the Floris area, acknowledged, \"that's a\r\n365-day proposition regardless of whether you're sick or anything like\r\nthat.\" Another resident, Margaret Mary Lee, explained it more tersely:\r\n\"Cows and hens and milk trucks did not take holidays.\"[5] The first\r\nmilking was early in the morning and most farmers rose around four\r\na.m.[6] The men and any hired hands usually began milking around 4:30\r\na.m., while the women prepared breakfast. What might initially appear to\r\nthe outsider as a pleasing novelty was hard and demanding work. This was\r\nespecially true in the morning when both the new and often the\r\nprevious night's milk needed to be hauled to Herndon for the early train\r\ninto Washington. Ray Harrison, with his brother the owner of one of the\r\narea's biggest herds, could milk a cow in six minutes--\"quicker than a\r\nlot people could do it\"[7]--but even at this rate, milking his 80-odd\r\ncows was a formidable undertaking. John Middleton, who lived down the\r\nroad from the Harrisons, estimated it took about 1-1/2 hours for seven\r\npeople to milk his herd of 40 cows; they barely finished in time for the\r\nhired man, who took the milk to Herndon, to grab a sandwich and cup of\r\ncoffee to eat en route.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portrait of a confident and successful farmer.

The barn could house over 50 cows.\r\nPhoto courtesy of Holden and Ray Harrison.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe milk which traveled to Herndon was strained to remove any extraneous\r\nmatter and cooked to about 35 deg. F to retard spoilage and reduce the risk\r\nof spreading bacterial infections. This was a real problem until\r\nmechanized refrigerators became available, and the farmers had to use\r\nconsiderable ingenuity to keep their milk chilled. Some, like the\r\nMiddletons, kept the milk in the well overnight, and Wilson McNair wrote\r\nthat his family stored the milk in tall cans set in cold water.\r\nOccasionally more drastic action was needed. \"Can you imagine going out\r\nto Herndon and getting great big chunks of ice and putting it in a\r\nwashing tub and setting a can of milk in and keeping it cool all night\r\nlong?\" queried Joseph Beard.[9]\r\n\r\nMilk earmarked for home use underwent the further process of separating\r\nthe thick cream from the rest of the milk. In the days before mechanical\r\nseparators the milk had to stand several hours for the cream to rise,\r\nand it was then skimmed by hand or the milk drawn off from the bottom of\r\na can with a spigot. Mechanical separators streamlined this task by\r\nallowing the milk to be separated while still warm, using centrifugal\r\naction to bring the heavier cream particles to the bottom of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nWhile the farmers sat down to breakfast the roads started filling with\r\nwagons and trucks bringing the day's milk from the entire area. Like\r\nAlexandria and Falls Church, the county's other major shipping centers,\r\nHerndon served what was known as a \"milkshed\" area, that is a community\r\nwhose milk could be transported to that locality without spoiling. Here\r\ntoo the freshness of the milk was of crucial concern. Herndon, with its\r\nelectric cars on the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, served most\r\nof the county's Dranesville district; however, Floris' close proximity\r\nto Herndon gave it an added advantage, for even packed in ice water,\r\nmilk could easily spoil during the sultry summer months.[10]\r\n\r\nA farmer with a good-sized herd such as John Middleton would haul eight\r\nor more ten-gallon cans of milk to the depot depending on the time of\r\nyear. The milk was transported in a light wagon with two horses, which\r\ngenerally held only one farm's milk, though sometimes two or more\r\nfamilies shared this duty. Rebecca Middleton recalled her brother\r\ncollecting cans in an early model truck with a canvas top; he traded\r\nhauling with the neighboring Bradleys.[11] For a short time a community\r\nco-op, based in Floris, was also established to collect milk for\r\nshipment to Washington, D.C.[12] As this milk-laden caravan approached\r\nHerndon, the small station there bustled suddenly with activity. For at\r\nleast one local resident, the sight and sounds were memorable. The\r\n\"banging of the milk cans at the depot,\" recalled Lottie Schneider, who\r\ngrew up in Herndon, \"... resounded far and wide.\" \"I liked to hear [it]\r\n... for busy men were working and it was a friendly sound.\"[13]\r\n\r\nMilking was, of course, just one of many chores involved on the family\r\nfarm. After a 6:30 breakfast (still early in the eyes of many city\r\ndwellers) there were stalls to clean, equipment to sterilize, other farm\r\nanimals to be cared for. Most Fairfax farms retained a few animals for\r\nhome use even when concentrating on milk production. Before\r\nmechanization completely revolutionized farm work, draft horses provided\r\nthe farm's muscle and a fifty-acre farm would need two to four for\r\nplowing, raking hay, and cutting wheat with a binder. The feeding and\r\ngrooming of these animals formed a vital task. Though Lang and Hurst's\r\ncommercial meat wagon came through Floris and other communities each\r\nSaturday, many families kept hogs and chickens for their own\r\nconsumption.[14] Elizabeth Rice from the Oakton area stated that,\r\ndespite her husband's reluctance to spend energy on any facet of farming\r\noutside dairying, they raised hogs, \"kept on the back end of the farm in\r\nthe woods.\"[15] In Floris nearly every family also raised hogs and\r\nchickens and Holden Harrison remembered that they \"used to get about a\r\nhundred chicks each spring--we'd eat them all up by fall.\"[16] Few\r\nFloris area farms kept sheep, though census figures show about 1,200 in\r\nthe county during this period.[17] In addition, dogs, cats, mules and an\r\noccasional goat made up the farm population, all demanding the farmer's\r\nattention and time.\r\n\r\nWith the stock watered, fed, given fresh bedding, and possibly turned\r\nout to pasture, the farmer could turn his attention to crops and other\r\nmatters. Census records show hay and corn to be Fairfax County's most\r\nimportant crops. Little of these were sold commercially, however, rather\r\nthey were used as support crops for the dairy industry.[18] Hay and feed\r\nstores abounded in neighboring towns but most dairymen attempted to\r\nsupply their own straw, ensilage and grain, thus cutting costs by making\r\nthe most efficient use of their land. This involved raising several\r\ncrops and a year-round effort of cultivation.\r\n\r\nWork began in early spring when a team of horses--later a\r\ntractor--pulled a steel plow across each field, turning up the earth\r\ninto a rough and lumpy mass. Little was known of contour plowing or\r\nplanting at this time, and the team was driven back and forth in\r\nstraight rows. C. T. Rice and County Agricultural Extension Agent H. B.\r\nDerr both noted that erosion was a major problem in the area at the\r\ntime.[19] The newly broken ground was then worked with a \"drag,\"\r\ngenerally made of heavy logs chained together and topped with a platform\r\non which the driver stood. The purpose of this implement was to use the\r\nweight of the \"drag\" to break up the soil clods. After this was\r\nfinished, a field still needed to be worked once more before planting,\r\nthis time with a harrow. The harrow resembled a large, spike-toothed\r\nrake, with two sections, each containing four rows of teeth. Passed over\r\nthe field, it stirred up the ground and continued the pulverization of\r\nthe soil to make a mellow, friable seed bed.[20]\r\n\r\nThese chores were exacting and time-consuming. Neal Bailey, who has\r\nspent many of his 66 years in working fields around Floris, estimated\r\nthat a man and strong team could harrow or drag but a ten-acre field in\r\nabout 6-1/2 hours. Plowing took even longer. \"Most of the land was hard\r\nto plow and we had to start as soon as possible in the spring in order\r\nto get through before it got too hard and sometimes we didn't make it,\"\r\nwrote Wilson McNair. The majority of farmers could plow only an acre or\r\nacre and a half in a day's time.[21]\r\n\r\nFairfax County's soil (principally Chester loam, a clay soil with a\r\nslightly acidic base) was deep, fertile and, as Joseph Beard put it,\r\n\"adapted to growing the kinds of things cows like to eat at a reasonable\r\nprice.\"[22] Because it was somewhat acidic, the soil benefitted from the\r\naddition of lime and, of course, needed other fertilizers. Fertilization\r\ntechniques had been known for hundreds of years (George Washington\r\nburned oyster shells to obtain lime for his fields), however, their\r\nbenefits were not always fully understood. Most farmers spread manure\r\nand some guano on their cropland, but correct chemical balances for\r\nspecific crops were achieved only infrequently. Often the small\r\nlandowner did not have spare fields to lie fallow for a year--the ideal\r\nsituation for soil enrichment. \"We spread some lime a time or two, but\r\nnot nearly enough,\" admitted Wilson McNair. \"We got burned lump lime and\r\ndumped it on the ground in piles of one bushel and when it had slaked we\r\nspread it with a shovel.\" The spreading itself could be a problem,\r\nespecially when the earliest trucks began to be used in the mid-1920s. A\r\ntruck hauling seven or eight tons of lime would bog down in a wet field:\r\n\"The only way you could get out was to dump the lime, and if you dumped\r\nthe lime you were in the hole you got stuck in.\" Thus, a lack of\r\nunderstanding of soil building techniques was coupled with the physical\r\ndifficulty of fertilization, to inhibit the optimum efficiency of the\r\nland in the early 20th century.[23]\r\n\r\nWith the soil prepared, the crops could be sown. In the fall, generally\r\nbetween mid-October and Thanksgiving, winter wheat was planted. A\r\n\"drill\" or mechanical planter drawn by horses was used, which could be\r\nadapted for use with oats, barley or rye. The area had once been a\r\nprincipal wheat-growing region, but in the early 20th century dairymen\r\ncultivated wheat chiefly for the straw which was used for bedding. In\r\nthe mid-1930s, however, the availability of certified seed (seed which\r\nwas grown to be of a uniform and established varietal type, much as\r\ngenetically pure livestock was bred) raised the quality of Fairfax\r\nwheat and slightly increased the grain's marketability.[24] Edith\r\nRogers, a long-time Floris resident and for many years a member of the\r\nFairfax County Board of Supervisors, grew wheat on her family's farm to\r\nuse in chicken feed, and to have milled into flour for home use. It was\r\nground at the Herndon Milling Company.[25] Like the use of certified\r\nseed, increased understanding of fertilization and crop rotation\r\npractices boosted production of wheat per acre, yet it never gained\r\nprominence as even a secondary crop. In large part this was due to the\r\nfact that wheat was a less desirable ingredient in cattle feed than was\r\ncorn or even soybeans.[26]\r\n\r\nCorn was planted in the spring, generally in late April. Again a drill\r\nwas employed, which, planting two rows at a time, enabled the farmer to\r\nplant about ten acres in one day. The wide variety of uses for corn made\r\nit Fairfax County's most important grain crop and a 1926 report on the\r\narea's agriculture observed that \"nearly every farm has more or less\r\ncorn.\"[27] Not only was the grain a chief ingredient in the dairy\r\ncattle's \"concentrate\" or feed mixture, but it was used to feed horses,\r\nchickens and to fatten pigs near butchering time. The leaves and stalks\r\nwere ground for ensilage or stored in the shock for dry fodder. During\r\nthe 1920s, County Agent Derr promoted a continual campaign to improve\r\nthe area's corn production and even introduced a new variety, dubbed\r\n\"Fairfax County White Corn,\" because of its local success. He also\r\nworked to increase yields of other popular strains, notably Reid's\r\nYellow Dent. In a report on his work in this field in 1925, Derr shows\r\nhis methods to be not far removed from the early genetic experimentation\r\nof Gregor Mendel.\r\n\r\n     For the past four years the writer has assisted one of his best\r\n     demonstrators in improving his crop of Reid's Yellow Dent Corn. The\r\n     first year the best 50 ears were planted in 50 separate rows and at\r\n     harvest time the best yielding 10 rows were selected for the next\r\n     year's work. This work was continued, each year the number of rows\r\n     being reduced. This year the results show a very uniform type of\r\n     corn....[28]\r\n\r\nSoybeans began to be introduced into the area during this period and\r\nFairfax County farmers also sowed various grasses for summer pasturage\r\nand to make hay for winter feeding. Timothy and clover predominated\r\namong pasture crops. Some farmers persisted in raising alfalfa, despite\r\nH. B. Derr's repeated protests that it was unprofitable on the county's\r\nlime-poor soil.[29] A few ambitious farmers even experimented with\r\ngrasses attempting to find those which produced the highest milk yields\r\nand one went so far as to have a special ladino clover seed brought from\r\nOregon because he felt it increased the richness of his milk.[30] As\r\nwith wheat and corn, improved varietal types and stricter control over\r\nthe uniformity of the seed greatly aided the cultivator.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spring plowing on the McNair farm near Floris. The serene\r\naspect of the pre-mechanization farm is evident in this photograph taken\r\nin the first decade of the twentieth century. Photo courtesy of Louise\r\nMcNair Ryder.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally, the farmer's work only began with the sowing of the seed, for\r\nactivity continued throughout the year. The work of calving, of pruning\r\norchard trees, digging garden beds, and trimming cattle hooves occurred\r\nin the spring. In early summer the corn was thinned from four to two\r\nstalks per hill, by using a sharp stick to dig the stalks out. Then,\r\ntoward the end of June the winter wheat was harvested. Cut with a binder\r\nand tied in bundles, it was shocked (put in stacks of ten to twelve\r\nbundles, wigwam fashion, with a bundle on top to shed water, or stacked\r\non poles in a mound with the outside sloping a bit to let the rain run\r\noff) and left to dry in the field. If threshed by hand after about a\r\nmonth it had to be gathered and taken to the barn for further drying.\r\n\r\nIn the 1920s, however, only a few farmers still wielded the flail; most\r\nthreshing was done by steam and later gas-powered threshing machines\r\nwhich travelled from farm to farm. Wilson McNair described these\r\ncumbersome and sometimes dangerous machines this way:\r\n\r\n     The thresher was run and pulled by a traction engine. They moved\r\n     slowly only about 2 mi. an hour. The engine had a water tank\r\n     mounted on each side in the rear to carry water while it was moving\r\n     from one place to another.... The engines all had whistles and they\r\n     would blow them every once in a while when they were on the road so\r\n     we would know they were coming. We had to haul up some wood to fire\r\n     the engine before we threshed....\r\n\r\n     In later years we had self-packing and weighing threshers with\r\n     blowers that moved the straw further from the thresher. One time\r\n     Mr. Hornbaker threshed for us. We had a small engine and thresher\r\n     that was pulled by a team. While we were washing up for dinner some\r\n     one looked up and saw smoke, [on] the other side of the barn where\r\n     the thresher was. All hands ran up there and pulled the thresher\r\n     out of the way and saved the wheat that was threshed, but the straw\r\n     burned up. A spark from the engine had fallen into the straw.[31]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months of the cultivation process, insect control was\r\nalso a major consideration. By the late 1930s a few large farms, such as\r\nthe Harrisons, could hire an airplane to dust their crops, but modest\r\nfarms of necessity relied on hand labor for this, as most other chores.\r\n\"As ... new varieties of clover, alfalfa, and other plants came to be\r\nused, seems like the insects came along with them,\" lamented one\r\nfarmer.[32] The Japanese beetle, introduced into America in the 1920s,\r\nwrecked particular havoc with the crucial corn crop. \"The Japanese\r\nbeetle was just awful,\" recalled Ray Harrison, \"it would eat the tassel\r\nup which pollinated the corn ... then would get right into the ear of\r\nthe corn and go right down into the shuckings.\"[33] Against these pests,\r\nand the inevitable destruction of wildlife, weather, and weeds, the\r\nfarmer had to maintain an eternal vigilance. Much of the growing season\r\nwas spent in monitoring these destructive forces.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this watchfulness became apparent with the harvest. As\r\nmentioned above, wheat was the earliest crop reaped but the major\r\nharvesting was done early in September. Corn was cut and shocked at this\r\ntime, and the large task of filling the silo was undertaken. To do this\r\nstalks and leaves of the corn were chopped by an ensilage cutter. Like\r\nthe thresher, this machine was generally owned by an outside agent; it\r\ntravelled from farm to farm to process each farmer's fodder. The early\r\ncutters were powered by steam, but like numerous other farm instruments,\r\ngasoline-driven equipment was developed during World War I. On a large\r\nfarm up to twenty men were needed to keep a threshing machine or\r\nensilage cutter going. Bundles of corn were chopped by the machine and\r\nthen conveyed to a fan which blew the ensilage through a pipe into the\r\nsilo. There one to four men tamped it down and guided the nozzle on the\r\nblower pipe to insure even distribution. It was dirty work, the corn\r\nstalks oozing juice and sticking as tenaciously as burrs to the clothes,\r\nhands and hair of those working in the silo. A small landowner might\r\ncomplete the silo filling process in a day, but for large farms it often\r\ntook the better part of a week.[34]\r\n\r\nJust as the spring brought forth a burgeoning activity, so did things\r\nhappen with a rush in the fall. Haying was done just before the corn\r\nharvest, in the hot, late summer days which would cure the new-mown\r\ngrass in the field. To cut the hay the county's farmers often used a\r\none- or two-horse rake with a single attachment to raise or lower the\r\nrake's teeth when passing over a meadow. The dried hay, with its almost\r\noverpoweringly sweet smell, was lifted by forks into a wagon, tramped\r\ndown, then transported to fill bursting barns. The least mechanized\r\nfarms forked the hay into the lofts by hand but later barns were\r\nequipped with a mechanical fork for lifting the hay. Haying had to be\r\ndone at precisely the right time or the grass would not cure properly\r\nand the hay would spoil. The combination of heat, hard, backbreaking\r\nwork, and the necessity for hurry made haying a particularly fatiguing\r\ntime.[35]\r\n\r\nMost of the harvest was used right on the farm. Like manure, which was\r\nrecycled to enrich fields and gardens, the grain and hay crops went to\r\nnourish the farm's dairy animals. Little was marketed and little was\r\nwasted. \"That proved to be the best thing you could do,\" noted Holden\r\nHarrison, \"grow as much of your own feed for your cattle as you could.\r\nYou sold your ... crop production through your milk can.\"[36]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A shock of wheat on the Ellmore farm near Floris.

Photo courtesy of Holden Harrison.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the year's labor came not only from the hay fields but\r\nfrom garden and orchard, whose abundance had to be gathered, preserved\r\nand stored in the late summer season. Fairfax County had once been a\r\nmajor truck farming section but the onslaught of insects and competition\r\nfrom large commercial orchards (such as those in the Shenandoah Valley)\r\nhad relegated this produce to the realm of home use. The A. S. Harrison\r\nfarm included plum, apple, peach and cherry trees and Margaret Mary Lee\r\nrecalled that cherries, pears and apples grew in her family's orchard.\r\nSometimes pears and apples were made into cider but most of the fruit\r\nwas dried or canned for winter use. Many farmers made the extra effort\r\nto keep bees under their fruit trees because they aided pollination and\r\nproduced honey from the blossoms. The Lees were among those who enjoyed\r\nthe soft hum of the bees among the orchard trees. Margaret Lee\r\nespecially liked to recall them darting busily between the fragrant\r\nwhite sheets, when the washing was hung in the yard.[37]\r\n\r\nThe vegetable garden, too, had a prominent place in the farm scheme.\r\nElizabeth Rice noted that \"everyone had a good garden, growing such\r\nthings as sweet corn, limas, string beans, potatoes, tomatoes, and\r\nasparagus.\"[38] Others mentioned lettuce, herbs and popcorn in the\r\nfamily vegetable patch and many farms had grape arbors.[39] Like other\r\nareas of cultivation, the garden plot required care and attention for\r\nthree seasons of the year. The round of soil preparation, planting,\r\nnourishing and harvesting added additional responsibilities to the\r\nmultitude of duties which already crowded the sunlight hours. Still, the\r\nrewards were great: self-sufficiency, economy, and the enjoyment of the\r\nearth's fresh bounty.\r\n\r\nWith the harvest over the farmer would fill the less hectic winter hours\r\nwith the unending minutia of the farm. Fence and equipment mendings,\r\ncutting ice from ponds and rivers, chopping wood, and grubbing up trees\r\nall had a part in his busy life. Another burst of activity occurred in\r\nearly winter when animals were butchered for the year's meat. Most farm\r\nfamilies bought their beef in Herndon, but nearly everyone kept hogs for\r\nhome consumption.[40] Neal Bailey, a veteran of many local butcherings,\r\ndescribed them in this particularly detailed manner:\r\n\r\n     Two to three meat hogs per year were raised and slaughtered, all\r\n     about Thanksgiving. Farmers used to do everything by the almanac.\r\n     Two men would grab a hog and throw it on its back and cut the\r\n     jugular vein with a butcher knife. The pig was thrown then into a\r\n     scalding trough--a metal trough with water placed over a wood fire\r\n     burning in a trench.... In the old days, the local farmers heated\r\n     rocks red hot and threw them in a big barrel of water. It was a\r\n     day's work to haul rocks for this. The hair was scalded and scraped\r\n     off. Then the hog was gutted. Old folks used to take the insides\r\n     and make chitlins out of them. I never ate them myself. The hogs\r\n     were hung up overnight in a shed or in a tree where dogs couldn't\r\n     get it, to let the carcasses cure. The skin was left on the\r\n     carcass, and next day, it was cut up and salted down in a box. It\r\n     was kept tight so flies and mice couldn't get in.... Anything that\r\n     was left in spring was smoked to preserve it through the\r\n     summer.[41]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A small orchard apiary kept to provide honey and aid\r\npollination of the fruit trees. Photo in Annual Report of County Agent\r\nH. B. Derr, 1925, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public Library.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEach family preserved its own meat and as Emma Ellmore related,\r\n\"everybody had his own pet recipe ... for mixing the salt and the brown\r\nsugar--and some smoked the meat and some didn't.\" Lard had to be\r\nrendered for storage in the cellar, sausage hand-ground and canned or\r\nfrozen, the heads boiled until the meat left the bones, then chopped and\r\npressed into a pan with the pot liquor to make headcheese. Butchering\r\ntime seems to have been an especially unforgettable occasion, for its\r\ndetails stand out sharply in the minds of many. \"After butchering each\r\nyear, Mother made ... buckwheat cakes to eat with fresh sausage,\"\r\nreminisced Margaret Peck. \"Baked on a long black griddle, over a wood\r\nstove, spread with homemade butter and topped with corn syrup, they were\r\nthe right beginning for a winter day.\"[42] For Floris residents, the\r\nsmells and tastes of a time seem to whirl the memory backward with\r\nparticular acuity.\r\n\r\nEven in the hectic activity of harvest, a farmer was obliged to move\r\nthrough the evening routine of milking, feeding and bedding his animals.\r\nWith these tasks completed, and a final check on the barns to see that\r\nall was snug, the farmer's day was nearly complete by about 6:00. He ate\r\na hearty supper, then read _The Southern Planter_, and possibly mended\r\nfarm machinery or did a little work in the barn.[43] For those who arose\r\nat 4:00 a.m. \"in all kinds of weather,\" sleep came early and the house\r\nwas usually dark by 9:00 p.m.[44]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn all of this activity of cultivation, the rush of harvest, and\r\nregularity of day-to-day chores, the farmer worked, not alone, but in\r\nconjunction with his family. Unlike the industrial worker, whose\r\nemployment was discrete and separate from his home life, the farmer's\r\nhome was his workshop, and his labor directly connected to his\r\nsustenance. His family was an integral part of this scheme; far from\r\nbeing removed from the household's form of support, they were intimately\r\nbound up in it. Wife, husband, children and grandparents all contributed\r\nin their distinct sphere. The term \"family farm\" was no idle\r\ndenomination, but a recognition of the importance the entire family\r\nplayed in the smooth operation of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of a farm husband and wife was in many ways a truer\r\npartnership than that of the urban marriage. \"A farmer needs a wife like\r\nhe needs the rain,\" is an old farm saying, expounded for decades in the\r\nfarmer's almanacs. It has now been collaborated by rural sociologists to\r\nshow that farm efficiency was based largely on the partners' shared\r\nduties.[45] The farmers themselves seemed to realize this. In a 1932\r\nnationwide survey of factors which farmers regarded as most important to\r\ntheir success, \"co-operation of wives\" was ranked second.[46]\r\n\r\nThe activities of rural men and women were co-equal, not identical.\r\nWomen rarely worked in the fields except in the press of harvesting when\r\nthey might drive a horse to pull up the hay fork--\"what we've all done,\r\nI guess,\" agreed one group of Floris women.[47] They only occasionally\r\naided the men in the barn. Edith Rogers remembered working with the\r\nstock as did Margaret Mary Lee, who helped with milking and also\r\nrecalled washing the milk storage tank and other equipment. This pleased\r\nthe local milk inspector who told her, \"When women are in the barn, I\r\nknow the equipment is clean.\"[48] Except for such intermittent work, the\r\noutside duties were left to the men. Instead, most women's activity was\r\nto be found in the farmhouse and garden. Her responsibilities\r\nencompassed the expected areas of housekeeping, decorating and sewing,\r\nand often the less obvious work of bookkeeping or lawnmowing.\r\n\r\nThe farm woman's most demanding task probably centered around the\r\npreparation and preservation of food, a vitally important function, for\r\nto waste or misuse food was to negate the hard labor of a year. In the\r\ncurrent era of convenience foods, the time-consuming nature of cooking\r\nis easily forgotten. Just operating a wood-burning stove was a\r\ncomplicated task, attested to by the directions for laying a fire in a\r\ncontemporary cookbook.\r\n\r\n     To build a fire, first let down the grate, and take up the ashes\r\n     and cinders carefully to avoid raising a dust, sifting the cinders\r\n     to use in building the fire; brush the soot and dust out of the\r\n     upper part of the stove, and from the flues which can be reached;\r\n     be sure that all parts of the ovens and hot-boxes are clean; if\r\n     there is a water-back attached to the stove, see that it is filled\r\n     with water; if it is connected with water-pipes, be sure in winter\r\n     that they are not frozen; brush up the hearth-stone. Lay the fire\r\n     as follows: Put a few handfuls of dry shavings or paper in the\r\n     bottom of the grate; upon them, some small sticks of pine wood laid\r\n     across each other; then a few larger sticks, and some cinders free\r\n     from ashes; a few small lumps of coke or coal may be mixed with the\r\n     cinders. Open all the draughts of the stove, close all the covers,\r\n     and light the fire; when the cinders are lighted, add fresh coke\r\n     and coal gradually and repeatedly until a clear, bright fire is\r\n     started; then partly close the draughts. To keep up a fire, add\r\n     fuel often, a little at once, in order not to check the heat:\r\n     letting the fire burn low, and then replenishing it abundantly, is\r\n     a wasteful method, because the stove grows so cold that most of the\r\n     fresh heat is lost in raising the temperature again to the degree\r\n     necessary for cooking.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\n  INVENTORY OF THE ESTATE OF GEORGE W.

Derr, 1929, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public Library.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the wood-burning stoves often imparted a special flavor to the\r\nfood prepared on them (for example, one farm cooking devotee opined that\r\nno waffles could taste like those from a wood-burning stove[50]), the\r\nstoves were fearfully hot in the summer and needed constant refueling\r\nand expert attention to heat evenly. Few Fairfax County farm women had\r\nthe luxury of electricity in their kitchens until well after 1935.\r\nStatistics show that only 65% of farm women cooked with electricity even\r\nin 1940.[51]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the large regular meals required by a hard-working\r\nfamily, the farm woman prepared the gargantuan harvest meals shared by\r\nall who worked in the fields. Cooking these meals in the late summer\r\nheat was a chore which took several days. \"An ordeal\" one veteran called\r\nit and enumerated some parts of the expected menu: corn bread, hot\r\nbiscuits, pork shoulder, pressed chicken, fried chicken, vegetables and\r\npie. \"We'd put food enough together for them--and did they eat!\"[52]\r\nEven at other times of the year, a farm wife needed to count on\r\nunexpected visitors and accommodate her activities to an unforeseen need\r\nto entertain. Her adaptability is attested to by Joseph Beard who\r\ndescribed the open farm hospitality of the era:\r\n\r\n     When anybody came around to your farm in those days, when\r\n     dinnertime came, you'd say, 'Well, it's time for dinner. Let's go\r\n     eat.' It didn't seem to matter if you had somebody drop in on you\r\n     on short notice. Women, ladies, mothers, wives, were accustomed to\r\n     this kind of thing. It never seemed to upset them. They just took\r\n     it in stride. They put on another plate and said, 'We haven't got\r\n     much, but you're welcome to what we have.' They'd go on like this.\r\n     They would bring out the best they could find. That was the kind of\r\n     condition that prevailed.[53]\r\n\r\nThe lady of the house in this period did not merely cook her family's\r\nfood; she was instrumental in its production and processing. The family\r\ngarden was generally her responsibility. It was she who planted the\r\nearly radishes, herbs, flowers and all the multitude of summer\r\nvegetables in the cool, moist spring soil, weeded and nurtured them\r\nthrough the summer months, and finally gathered them in the lingering\r\nIndian summer days. If there were daughters in the family, they aided\r\nher in this as in her other activities. When the produce was finally all\r\npicked, peeled and cut, she combined them with vinegar, sugar, and\r\nspices to preserve the vegetables as pickles, jelly or canned goods. It\r\nwas warm and tiring, but highly rewarding work. \"Never will I forget the\r\npungent fragrances that pervaded the air when it was catsup or\r\npickle-making season,\" wrote Lottie Schneider.\r\n\r\n     When our mothers made apple butter in great kettles each child took\r\n     a turn at stirring the delicious mixture. The wonderful fragrance\r\n     made the task easier even though the thickening ingredients\r\n     sometimes sputtered and caused burns as they popped out on the\r\n     hands who used the stirring paddle.[54]\r\n\r\nThe pantry shelves filled with glass jars displaying their highly\r\ncolored contents produced feelings of pride and plenty in the farm\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nPoultry keeping also fell to the farmer's wife. There were a sizable\r\nnumber of commercial poultry farms in the county--it was in fact the\r\narea's second most important farm industry--but most dairy and general\r\nfarms kept just enough for their own use.[55] Egg collecting, feeding\r\nand cleaning of the chicken house and yard, even killing, dressing and\r\nplucking the poultry were done by female members of the farm family.\r\nThrifty women saved the feathers for pillows and coverlets and nearly\r\nall sold their excess eggs to the \"hucksters\" who travelled from farm to\r\nfarm buying surplus goods. These peddlars also bought rabbits, turkeys,\r\nand other poultry, as well as home-churned butter from the farms. This\r\nwas yet another area in which women utilized and processed the raw\r\nmaterials of the land. Twice a week the cream that had been skimmed and\r\nsaved was churned (generally in round barrel churns with wooden\r\npaddles), salted, and packed in stone jars to be picked up and\r\ntransported to the Alexandria and Washington markets. One of the early\r\nhucksters was Earl Robey who collected eggs and chickens once a week.\r\n\"He travelled with 2 horses hitched to a covered wagon,\" wrote one\r\nfarmer. \"In later years he had a model T truck.\" The money made by the\r\nwomen was theirs to keep, for running the house and personal expenses,\r\nand the austerity or comparative comfort of a farmstead was often the\r\ndirect result of the energy and efficiency of the farm woman.[56]\r\n\r\nThe rural woman's place was respected and secure on the farms of fifty\r\nyears ago. The farmer might consider himself the overall manager but he\r\nrecognized his spouse's vital contributions. \"Mutually they both decided\r\nto make things go and they did go,\" wrote one 1930s farm boy of his\r\nparents. \"Mother did not feel inferior to father and she never felt that\r\nhe expected her to feel so.\"[57] If the woman's role and duties were\r\nfirmly set in this rural society, then so was her status.\r\n\r\nAn additional responsibility was that of caring for children, but in the\r\nfarm family this was more clearly a joint obligation of the father and\r\nmother than in families in which the male parent left home to work. Too,\r\nchildren were more closely tied to the family as a working unit; they\r\nfelt both the necessity of aiding their parents with the running of the\r\nfarm and the pride of contributing in a real sense to the family's\r\nwell-being. Of course, farm children attended school, but they also\r\nshared the pattern of their parents' life. With father and mother they\r\nawoke in the early hours of the morning to help with barn or household\r\nchores: \"It didn't make any difference how small they were, they got up\r\nat six o'clock.\"[58] Many learned to milk before the age of ten. On\r\nweekends, summer holidays and after school, they were also expected to\r\nhelp on the farm. Both boys and girls performed the unending job of\r\ngathering firewood for the kitchen stove. Carrying water was another\r\nconstant chore which often fell to the family's children, for as late as\r\n1940 nearly 40% of the county's homes still lacked running water.[59]\r\nFarm youngsters learned to drive a team and ride horseback at an early\r\nage, and this enabled them to take a horse to be shod, fetch a mower\r\nsection from the general store, or run other unexpected errands.\r\nMargaret Lee stated that as a girl she used to hitch up a mule and buggy\r\neach Monday to take the family's laundry to be washed by a local Negro\r\nlaundress, and pick it up again on Thursday.[60] Girls also helped with\r\nthe dishes, fed chickens, and cooked while boys tackled plowing,\r\nthreshing and animal husbandry. One woman recalled the special\r\nsatisfaction she felt when, at the age of thirteen, she shocked an\r\nentire field of wheat.[61] By doing these chores and errands, farm\r\nchildren were not merely assisting in the farm operation. In the\r\nemulation of their parents' activity, they benefitted from a kind of\r\non-the-job training which both sharpened their skills for a later farm\r\ncareer and furthered their identity with the family group and farm life\r\nin general.\r\n\r\nThe farm child's close connection to his parents' life and the necessity\r\nfor performing a variety of chores also acted in some measure as a force\r\nfor social control: the child who worked with his parents was expected\r\nto act in a manner acceptable to them. Furthermore, the close-knit\r\nnature of the community reinforced the parents' values when their\r\noffspring were away from home. \"A farmer was always busy, and his kids\r\ndidn't run the streets,\" noted Joseph Beard.[62] Another native of\r\nnorthern Virginia explained the prevalent philosophy in more detail:\r\n\r\n     Papa was a firm believer that work was a therapy that kept young\r\n     people out of mischief. It was unthought of for youngsters to get\r\n     into serious trouble in those days other than smoking corn silk or\r\n     grapevine, and that was a punishment in itself. All were assigned\r\n     specific chores and the youngest started out picking up chips and\r\n     other small pieces of wood from the 'woodpile' for kindling to\r\n     start the fire in the kitchen range at daylight in the morning....\r\n     As we grew a little older bringing in the firewood was added to the\r\n     list of chores and when you grew big enough to chop and split\r\n     cordwood, usually around the age of 10-12 years, one found the\r\n     chores around the home were endless.[63]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rebecca Rice, daughter of C.

She refurbished the room herself as part of a 4-H project.\r\nPhoto in H. B. Derr Reports, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County\r\nPublic Library.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe round of chores might seem endless, but farm kids had their fun,\r\ntoo. Joseph Beard and Richard Peck both recall swimming in Horse Pen Run\r\nand Peck also reminisced about fishing in the local streams.[64]\r\nMargaret Lee was sometimes treated to a baked sweet potato after school;\r\nshe rode the family mule for recreation.[65] At Halloween, much secret\r\ngiggling went on as plans were afoot to take an outhouse and sit it on\r\nthe school porch, or sneak all of the milk cans out of the dairy and set\r\nthem outside.[66] Skating on the baptismal pond of Frying Pan Baptist\r\nChurch, and neighborhood events such as picnics, watermelon feasts and\r\noyster suppers also lent excitement to the child's life. Perhaps the\r\nmost pervasive enjoyment came from the ever-changing delights of the\r\ncountryside itself. Wrote one resident of the Herndon area: \"We could\r\nramble through the woods, finding huckleberries, wild flowers, sassafras\r\nroots and stems, chestnuts and lovely mosses.\"[67]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough children provided a great deal of supplemental labor on the\r\ncounty's small farms, the \"hired hand\" was also an important part of the\r\ncommunity's work force. One local resident estimated that approximately\r\nhalf of the farms in the Herndon area used hired labor, and this figure\r\nis collaborated by the agricultural census of 1940. Other evidence shows\r\nthat the largest single expense (about 38% of total farm expenditures)\r\nfor the owner of thirty or more acres was hired help.[68] In Fairfax\r\nCounty, as in most of the South, this hired labor was composed almost\r\nentirely of the community's black residents, though occasionally a\r\nfamily would employ a white man. The Ellmore family, who often had a\r\nwhite man as their hired help, was such an exception.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A homemade sled used for hauling manure to the fields.\r\nNote the two young boys who, by driving the sled, shared the family's\r\nresponsibility for the farm.

Larger farms frequently kept one\r\nor two men throughout the year, sometimes supplying them with a house\r\nand their noon meal as well as a salary.[70] On most farms, however,\r\nextra help would be hired at particularly busy seasons by the day or\r\nthe week. \"In the summertime you'd get seasonal help, gather them up\r\nhere and there, wherever you could,\" stated Holden Harrison. \"If you\r\ncould carry those men, at least the best ones, over the winter, then\r\nyou'd have a good force that you could depend on for your summer work,\r\nyour planting and harvesting.\"[71] In some cases the hired man would\r\ncome with his team of horses for which he received additional wages. In\r\nanother variation groups of workers would organize into crews to perform\r\na specific function (for example, to fill a silo) and travelled from\r\nfarm to farm accomplishing this special task.[72]\r\n\r\nMany of the laborers in the Floris area came from Willard, a community\r\nof both whites and blacks, just over the Loudoun County line. About 85%\r\nof Fairfax County's black population owned no land in 1934 and supported\r\nthemselves solely by agricultural labor.[73] Unlike this large landless\r\nmajority, many of Willard's families owned three to fifteen acres of\r\nland. Most of these families grew vegetables on their land and nearly\r\nall kept a cow.[74] A few black families tried to support themselves by\r\ntruck gardening, a difficult task when competing with larger more\r\neconomical farms. One such farmer, Ernest E. Webb, struggled to maintain\r\nhis children by selling vegetables in the city market. Biweekly he took\r\nhis goods by wagon across the low, unstable Chain Bridge and along Canal\r\nRoad to the markets in Washington, but for this long, exhausting trip\r\nhis profits were slim: \"We made enough to come back home, feed the\r\nhorses, and feed ourselves a little for another trip.\"[75] To eke out an\r\nexistence, most blacks had to supplement any farming income they might\r\nhave by working as agricultural laborers.\r\n\r\nThose laborers who did not have steady employment had to wait for work\r\nuntil they were needed for a specific job. When a farmer wanted extra\r\nhelp, he went to the black community, or sent word by someone else, and\r\ndetailed the number of men needed and the job to be done. \"In the spring\r\nmy father would go up there [to Willard] or send me up there to see if I\r\ncould get three or four fellows to help get the spring work going,\"\r\nremarked Holden Harrison. \"Maybe you could get them and maybe you\r\ncouldn't.\"[76] Sometimes there was a labor shortage, but frequently more\r\nmen wanted work than there were jobs to go around. Several area\r\nresidents remembered that if word got out that ten men were needed for a\r\njob, often fifteen or more would show up.[77] This was especially true\r\nduring the agricultural depression of the 1920s and 1930s, which hit\r\nblacks far worse than the county's white population. The blacks'\r\nlandholdings were of inferior quality and generally too small for\r\nefficient operation, and this, combined with their meagre operating\r\ncapital and inadequate reserves, made the black agriculturalist more\r\ndependent than ever on work from the large landowner.[78]\r\n\r\nThe hired man was expected to arrive in time for the early morning\r\nmilking and work the lengthy fifteen-hour day alongside the farmer. His\r\nchores ranged from making hay to cutting wood and building fences. Neal\r\nBailey recalled that he spent his entire first day as a laborer driving\r\nfence posts with a 16-pound hammer. The standard salary was $1.00 to\r\n$1.50 per day plus all he could eat for lunch. Some farmers paid by the\r\njob rather than by the day though they found the latter system\r\npreferable. When the help was not so concerned with completing a task\r\nrapidly, farmers believed it produced a better quality work.\r\nOccasionally the white farmers shared or traded work with their black\r\ncounterparts. More frequently, hired hands worked for a share of the\r\nfruits of their labor. At butchering time, the hired help might go home\r\nwith sausage, side meat (bacon) or a pork shoulder for his pay. At berry\r\nseason they picked a farmer's blackberries or wild cherries for half of\r\nthe take.[79]\r\n\r\nThe women and children of the black communities in Fairfax County also\r\nworked. Black women took in laundry, picked fruit and sometimes came to\r\nthe white farmer's houses to help with canning or meat preservation at\r\nbutchering time. One woman worked as a midwife; according to Margaret\r\nLee, the only one in the area. She delivered Miss Lee's younger sister\r\naround 1913.[80] Children as young as nine would thin corn or pluck\r\npotato bugs off the dark, leafy plants for 50c a day. Girls used to pick\r\nberries and pull field cress when it was going to seed, and some\r\nchildren worked in the farmhouses running errands.[81] The Ellmore\r\nfamily often had a young boy to help do odds and ends, and another\r\nFloris resident noted that \"there was some twins of about twelve years\r\nold and we needed a little help so I took one of them in the house and\r\nmy brother had the other out to help him with things.\"[82] Neal Bailey\r\nrecalled going out to help his father cut corn at a very young age and\r\nbeing told to \"keep working--you have no back,\" even when it felt as if\r\nit were breaking.[83]\r\n\r\nWithin these labor relationships the white employer retained the most\r\ncontrol since he set wages and hours, and because he worked with the\r\nknowledge that the black families were dependent on him for employment.\r\nYet the blacks had their influence too, for the larger landowners needed\r\ntheir labor to keep the farms operating smoothly. The farmer's\r\ndependence was apparent in instances such as that related by Ray\r\nHarrison, who remembered one Christmas night when no help at all showed\r\nup. That night he milked fifty-two cows by hand, something he could not\r\nafford to do every day.[84] In numerous ways the hired hands exercised\r\nsome control over their working conditions. For example, seasoned\r\nworkmen reserved the right to \"break in\" a field hand new to the\r\nneighborhood, thus both initiating him into local work patterns and\r\nassuring that his expectations and treatment corresponded to that of the\r\nveteran help.[85] In times of intense activity, the labor supply would\r\nbe short and the workers raised their prices accordingly. One farmer\r\nrecalled that during an exceptionally busy silo-filling season the help\r\nwere \"jacking up the price ... ten cents an hour about four times in\r\none day.... They were putting pressure on because they thought they had\r\nthe leverage there.\" In this case the farmer called their bluff and sent\r\nthe workers home, but in many instances, the laborers held sway and\r\nreceived higher wages during peak work periods.[86]\r\n\r\nThe white attitude toward their black workers seems to have been\r\npaternalistic, as was the pattern of most racial relations in the\r\npost-bellum South. Though area farmers maintain that their hired\r\nlaborers were liked and respected--\"as much a part of the neighborhood\r\nas anyone else\"--in conversation capable workers were referred to as\r\n\"boy\" or by the old plantation epithets of \"Aunt\" and \"Uncle.\" A hearty\r\nnoon meal was part of the hired man's pay, but the help ate outside by\r\nthemselves, rather than with the family.[87] Moreover, rather than admit\r\nhis need for the laborers, the white employer sometimes viewed his\r\nhiring in an altruistic light. \"I remember my brother went over to these\r\ncolored people that had been working for him at different times, in the\r\nmiddle of the winter, and told them to come over and cut some wood, and\r\nhe paid them for it so that they would have something, because they were\r\npretty bad off. So he just made work for them,\" stated one county\r\nwoman.[88] Undoubtedly, charitable motives were truly meant, but the\r\noutcome was a paternalistic attitude which failed to recognize the\r\nmutual dependence of land and labor.\r\n\r\nThis reliable supply of labor eliminated the county's need for migratory\r\nworkers, and also reduced the amount of tenancy since most farmers found\r\nlabor enough to manage all of their acreage. Nevertheless, during the\r\nperiod between 1918-1940, about 10-12% of the white farm population and\r\n2% of the black were tenants.[89] Statistical evidence shows over half\r\nof the tenants to be cash croppers in 1925 and 40% in 1940. Many\r\nhistorians believe this to be the least beneficial system for the tenant\r\nas his obligation was to pay the landlord a fixed rent on the land\r\nregardless of the success of his crop.[90] However, Joseph Beard stated\r\nthat most of the tenants with whom he had contact when he was county\r\nagent in the late 1930s were sharecroppers. By this system, the renting\r\nfarmer supplied his tools and labor, the landlord furnished the land,\r\nand the crop was split.\r\n\r\nFairfax County never harbored the kind of perpetual tenancy described by\r\nJames Agee's _Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_, in which families lived in\r\nsqualor and humiliation with little hope of pulling their way out of\r\ndebt. This occurred more frequently in the one-crop areas of the deep\r\nSouth where exhausted soil and crop dependency made for a high debt risk\r\neach year. Beard maintained that the sharecroppers of the late 1930s\r\nwere respectable people, merely renting land until they could afford to\r\npurchase their own. In several instances, they were young local couples\r\nwho went on to buy their tenured land and to become established members\r\nof the community.[91] Still, at best, any tenure system was a\r\ndemoralizing one for the renter because his profits were consistently\r\nskimmed off to the landlord.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I--NOTES\r\n\r\n_Continuity_\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Interview with Joseph Beard by Elizabeth Pryor, Fairfax, Virginia,\r\nJanuary 23, 1979; notes from interview with Margaret Mary Lee by Nan\r\nNetherton, Herndon, Virginia, March 28, 1978.

Except\r\nfor the change from slave to free labor and the marginal use of\r\nmechanical equipment, these elements made up a world in which the farmer\r\nof 1890, 1870, or even 1850 would have felt comfortable. But running\r\nconcurrently with these expected qualities of rural life were major\r\nchanges which jarred and fractured the constant trends of farming.\r\nChange in attitude, technology or society occurs during all periods, but\r\nthe 1920s and 1930s were a particularly dynamic time in the field of\r\nagriculture. Advances in the understanding of plant biology, animal\r\nhusbandry and soil conservation, together with higher living standards\r\nthrough rural electrification and improved communications, were a cause\r\nfor optimism about the future of the family farm. Yet these advances\r\nirrevocably altered the familiar rural life patterns. To maintain his\r\nown station within this changing world, the farmer's outlook and methods\r\nwould also have to change.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most obvious modification of the traditional methods of\r\nfarming was the increased mechanization of many farm functions during\r\nthe early part of the 20th century. Not only were plows improved (by the\r\naddition of a vertical disk which made for deeper cutting and more\r\nthorough turning of the soil) and heavier harrows developed, but\r\ngasoline-powered machinery began to be widely used.[92] The diesel\r\ntractor had actually been available as early as 1905, but was not\r\ngenerally adopted until World War I at which time military\r\nexperimentation improved the engine's construction and worker shortages\r\nmade the labor-efficient machinery especially valuable. The introduction\r\nin 1924 of an all-purpose tractor, which could cultivate as well as\r\nprepare the soil, increased the machinery's usefulness and gave an\r\nadditional thrust to its popularity.[93] The tractor was meant to\r\nreplace the work of draft horses, the large, gentle creatures who, along\r\nwith oxen and mules, had supplied the farm's power for centuries. The\r\nsaving the new machinery incurred was chiefly in time, an intangible\r\nelement of economics which farmers were just beginning to consider in\r\ntheir appraisal of income and farm value. Often the use of a tractor cut\r\nwork time by half or more. Ray Harrison recalled that it took five\r\nhorses and three men several days work to clean out the trees and brush\r\nfor a potential field; his brother could do it with only one helper in a\r\nsingle day.[94]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A broadcast harvester capable of picking four rows at a\r\ntime. This mechanical picker was developed by a county farmer, H. C.\r\nClapp. Photo in H. B. Derr Report, 1921, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax\r\nCounty Public Library.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wheat being mechanically harvested, c. 1925. Few farms\r\ncould afford the luxury of such equipment at this time. Photo in H. B.\r\nDerr Report, 1925, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early tractors were not without their problems. Initially their\r\nwheels were of steel, which packed down the wet earth making plowing\r\ndifficult, or lost traction and became mired in the ever-present red\r\nmud; the addition of spiked wheels or heavy chains helped only a little\r\nbefore pneumatic tires were introduced in 1932.[95] The machinery was\r\nalso expensive and complicated to repair. Few farms were as fortunate as\r\nthe Harrisons' on which one brother had taken numerous mechanical\r\ncourses and had even worked in a tractor repair shop.[96] For farmers\r\nwho could not always correlate time savings with financial advantage,\r\nthe large capital outlay seemed unnecessary or even unwise. As the\r\nmachinery was best adapted to large farms and intensive cultivation,\r\nthis was especially true in situations where the farmer did not feel\r\noverworked, or held few ambitions to expand production.\r\n\r\nThus, Fairfax County farmers were slow to embrace the newfangled\r\ntechnology. A 1924 survey of the county showed that only 10% of the\r\nfarmers owned a tractor despite County Agent Derr's assertion that the\r\n\"cutting of wheat with the tractor had been found the most economical\r\nway for many reasons. The principle being rapidity and saving of\r\nlabor.\"[97] As late as 1936 Derr wrote that the majority of the small\r\nfarmers could not afford to purchase mechanized equipment and were\r\ncompelled to continue with their horses. The cost was partially offset\r\nby machinery loaned by the United States Department of Agriculture\r\n(USDA), for example, a seed corn grader and wheat smut treater which\r\ntravelled \"like a missionary ... from farm to farm in their crop\r\nimprovement work.\"[98] Nevertheless even men such as A. S. Harrison, one\r\nof the area's most progressive farmers, were hesitant about the new\r\nmachines, as Holden Harrison relates:\r\n\r\n     He knew I was sort of a tractor bug, and one day he called me in\r\n     and he said, 'Now son, now we don't use tractors out here, we grow\r\n     the feed for the horses ... we do our farm work with horses.' But\r\n     that very spring it got so hot that an old broken down tractor that\r\n     I rounded up did more work than the twelve horses we had.[99]\r\n\r\nEconomics, custom and suspicion of objects so divorced from nature's\r\ncadence reduced the farmers' enthusiasm for new machinery.\r\n\r\nMechanized milking equipment was also held in suspicion initially.\r\nMilking machines were developed around 1900, but a prejudice against\r\nthem lasted well into the 1920s. Older cows, accustomed to hand milking,\r\ndid not like the sound and feel of the machines and many farmers\r\ncontended that they impaired the milk-producing capabilities of some\r\nanimals.[100] Separators were likewise mistrusted by some who felt that\r\nthey skimmed the cream inadequately. Moreover, most of the dairy\r\nequipment required electricity for its operation and for many years this\r\nwas not readily available in the area. These factors kept milking\r\nmachines from being swiftly adopted in Fairfax County. Conversations\r\nwith farmers of the inter-war period indicate that such equipment was\r\nnot generally acquired until the mid 1930s.[101]\r\n\r\nFarmers learned of the new labor-saving devices by word of mouth,\r\nthrough agricultural organizations, catalogs and manufacturer's\r\nsalesmen. The latter could be a nuisance to the already preoccupied\r\nfarmer, but he also acted as an invaluable informational source.\r\n\r\nOne dairyman explained:\r\n\r\n     That was a very useful service that salesmen performed. Salesmen\r\n     sort of get a black eye from some quarters but they kept the\r\n     farmers up to date on the new machines.... We had a very good\r\n     tractor with steel wheels, and a salesman came in and said, 'I'm\r\n     representing Goodrich Rubber Company. We're making tractor tires\r\n     now and if you'll let us put a set of tires on your tractor we'll\r\n     let you try them out, and if you don't like them, we'll take them\r\n     off and go back home with them.' So we did, we tried them and they\r\n     worked.[102]\r\n\r\nThe new equipment, attachments and improvements could be bought on\r\ncredit, or by deferred payment (that is, extended credit) until a crop\r\nwas harvested. This was frequently necessary as the machinery was\r\ncostly. Joseph Beard indicated that a tractor cost about $600 to $800 in\r\n1930. The Sears and Roebuck catalog for 1928 offered an electric milker\r\nfor $145 (including a 3/4 horsepower engine) and a harrow attachment to\r\nbe used with a tractor for $60. Cream separators ranged from $42.95 to\r\n$100 without a motor, which could cost as much as $30.00. \"Don't make a\r\nhorse out of yourself,\" the catalog cajoled. But with the additional\r\ncost of parts, maintenance and fuel, a farmer earning only $1,000\r\nannually could at best hope to equip his farm only gradually.[103]\r\n\r\nTo offset costs, farmers retained their old tools while gradually\r\nacquiring up-to-date equipment. An inventory of the equipment on a\r\nfifty-acre farm shows the mix of old and new owned by the typical farmer\r\nof this transition period. In 1928 the farm of George W. Kidwell near\r\nHunter was equipped with harnesses, a two-horse plow, and blacksmithing\r\ntools, but also a gasoline engine, an oil drum and automobile.[104]\r\n\r\nUltimately, of course, the machines were of tremendous advantage to the\r\nlarge and specialized dairyman. They speeded and streamlined the\r\ntwice-daily milkings, efficiently strained and separated the milk while\r\nwarm. Later, the machines cooled the milk to the optimum temperature\r\nrequired to retard spoilage. This latter development was an especially\r\nnoteworthy improvement over the old well or ice-water coolings.\r\n\r\nSimilar advances were made with electric incubators and chicken feeders\r\nfor poultry specialists and improved spraying equipment for orchardists.\r\nWarren McNair was a pioneer in the Floris neighborhood in the use of\r\nmechanized hatcheries, establishing one which was powered by coal before\r\nWorld War I. Like the dairy equipment, poultry technology offered\r\nefficiency and improved production.[105]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A tractor-drawn drill which could plant four rows at a\r\ntime.

Some experimentation in plant and animal breeding was\r\nattempted around the turn of the century, but the real impetus for\r\nextended research was the passage of the Smith-Lever Act in 1914. In\r\nVirginia the work was undertaken at the Virginia Polytechnical Institute\r\n(VPI) in Blacksburg. The early efforts of the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture were enlarged at this time and, most significantly, were\r\nmade accessible to individual farmers through the county agricultural\r\nextension program. Interconnected with the state agricultural colleges,\r\nthe program used representatives known as county agents to advise and\r\neducate the farmers. Working on a personal level, they were able to, in\r\nthe words of one Fairfax agent, \"bring the college to the people.\" As a\r\nresult of the improved access to information, new ideas on breeding,\r\nanimal care, soil improvements, and planting almost inundated the\r\nfarmer.[106]\r\n\r\nOf special importance was an increased understanding of livestock\r\nbreeding and a change in the desired criteria for a prime animal. As\r\nmore and more emphasis was placed on pragmatic qualities, the old show\r\npoints of stature, color or markings lost prestige next to reproductive\r\ncapacity or productivity. One Maryland farmer who marketed his products\r\nin the same areas as Fairfax dairymen, stated the case emphatically.\r\n\"What does a man want a cow for? _Milk!_ And to get milk you've got to\r\nhave a ... female animal with some size to her, strong bone, a good bag\r\nand a big barrel--a real machine ... producing quality milk.\"[107] A\r\nFairfax County poultry raiser concurred. Complaining to the editor of\r\nthe _Fairfax Herald_ in 1926, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     As is now being done, fowls are being judged by the show standard\r\n     rather than from a utility standpoint. As one member [of the\r\n     Poultrymen's organization] present stated ... one of his birds won\r\n     the blue ribbon as the best marked bird in her class but shortly\r\n     after the fair he sold her in the market owing to [her] being such\r\n     a poor layer.[108]\r\n\r\nActually some disagreement occurred over exactly which qualities should\r\nbe stressed in breeding. Experts in animal husbandry found that\r\ncross-breeding often produced the highest yield of milk, a conclusion\r\nwhich was at odds with those who wanted to emphasize pure-bred stock. In\r\nFairfax County, H. B. Derr followed the latter persuasion. In the end\r\nboth parties hoped to achieve the same result: a controlled breeding\r\nprogram which would allow the farmer to predetermine the type and\r\ncharacteristics of the stock on his farm.\r\n\r\nTo improve the county's stock, farmers were urged to breed their\r\nlivestock with purebred animals whenever possible, and keep accurate\r\nrecords of milk and egg production. An especially successful tool was\r\nthe establishment of Dairy Herd Improvement Associations which tested\r\nthe yield and butter fat content of each cow's milk. The aim of these\r\norganizations was to identify the high and low producers in a herd so\r\nthat poor producers could be sold and breeding done to best advantage.\r\nAgricultural Agent H. B. Derr moved quickly to establish these groups in\r\nthe county. By 1920 two of the fourteen Dairy Herd Improvement\r\nAssociations in Virginia were in Fairfax County, and the result was a\r\ncontinual improvement in the stock owned by Fairfax farmers. Derr\r\nreported with pleasure that within the first year of the program 15% of\r\nthe cows were eliminated and replaced by better stock and that \"one\r\ndairyman said the first month's test paid for the year's work.\"[109]\r\n\r\nSimilar improvements were taking place in the grading and\r\nstandardization of seed. When Derr first arrived in Fairfax County in\r\n1917, he complained that it was \"the dumping ground of about as bad a\r\nlot of seed as he had ever seen.\"[110] Old or genetically mixed seed\r\nyielded poor crops and Derr organized volunteer farmers to help test new\r\nstrains as well as established varieties in the area's soil. The\r\nexperimentation for crop return and quality and controlled breeding done\r\nat the Virginia Polytechnical Institute and similar institutions\r\nincreased the variety of seed available and made for highly predictable\r\nreturns. An additional help was the increased dependability of seed\r\ndistributors. Holden Harrison recalled that Southern States Cooperative\r\nwas particularly conscientious in this regard. \"Other seed companies had\r\nbegun to improve their seed stocks, but Southern States put the emphasis\r\non it. The seed wheat we got from Southern States outproduced any other\r\nthat we could find.\"[111] Whereas traditionally many had merely been\r\nsaving the most likely ears of corn or a random bushel of wheat for\r\nseed, the farmer now demanded certified seed of a variety most\r\nresponsive to his area's soil type and weather.\r\n\r\nAgriculturalists were also making huge strides in understanding the\r\nphysical needs of animals and disease prevention. The discoveries about\r\nbacterial and viral infections made by medical researchers during the\r\n1920s and 1930s were beginning to be understood in veterinary circles\r\nand applied to animal care. Mastitis and chicken cholera were among the\r\ncommon diseases brought under control by new drugs. County agents\r\ncarried medicine and veterinary equipment with them using it both in\r\nemergency cases and to instruct farmers in sanitation and preventative\r\ncare.[112] Health standards, especially for dairy products sold in\r\nWashington, D.C., had been stiffened during the first World War, and it\r\nwas important for the farmer to understand disease prevention not only\r\nto save his animals but to keep his produce marketable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soybeans on a demonstration field showing the\r\nimprovements made by the addition of lime to the soil. Photo in H. B.\r\nDerr Report, 1925, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVeterinarians abounded in the area, but were called in generally for\r\nrequired tests (such as tuberculin) or when the situation was really\r\ngrave; most farmers relied on their own experience for delivering\r\ncalves or treating common ailments.[113] Among the prominent vets in the\r\ncounty were Dr. Harry Drake, Dr. Bernard Poole and C. L. Kronfeld. All\r\nof these men made house calls, bringing medical kits and medicine with\r\nthem. Their fee was $2.50 per visit which included the price of\r\nfollow-up medicine. Perhaps because this fee was prohibitive to some, or\r\nthrough a desire for self-reliance, farmers often neglected to call the\r\nveterinarian until an animal was critically ill. \"The farmer in what I\r\nsuspect was fifty percent of the cases lost the animal anyway after the\r\nvet got there,\" acknowledged Joseph Beard,\r\n\r\n     because so many times instead of having preventative medicine ...\r\n     they never called him until things were in very bad shape. I\r\n     suspect that the vet would have been able to save so many of the\r\n     animals that he didn't by virtue of the fact that he didn't get\r\n     there on time.... They weren't interested in prevention; they were\r\n     interested in the cure.[114]\r\n\r\nThe farmers were not entirely to blame since preventative medicine was a\r\nnew concept, the benefits of which were not always immediately obvious.\r\nCounty agents Derr and Beard both waged exhaustive battles to convince\r\nlocal agriculturalists of the advantage of vaccination and show them the\r\nproper methods of inoculating their own animals. Derr found the farmers\r\nunwilling to do their own vaccinating, preferring to rely on\r\nspecialists; yet with classic inconsistency they were also reluctant to\r\ncall in a veterinarian for such a purpose.[115] In the end, the agents\r\nfound that, like many other progressive techniques which seemed new and\r\nunsubstantiated to the farmer, demonstration worked better than\r\nrhetoric. An example of this occurred in 1926 when a farmer let some\r\ncattle onto a pasture, believed to be infested with a calf disease known\r\nas blackleg. When one of his best calves died, he panicked and turned to\r\nthe county agent. The farmer's animals were all inoculated, as were\r\nthose on several neighboring farms, and there were no further losses.\r\n\"This incident has done more to place confidence in vaccinations than\r\nseveral years' talking could do,\" wrote a pleased H. B. Derr. \"There are\r\nno more doubting Thomases in that community at least.\"[116]\r\n\r\nSimilar work was undertaken to convince orchardists and crop producers\r\nof the advantages of preventative spraying to eliminate bacterial\r\ndiseases and aid in insect control. The county's production of fruits,\r\nvegetables and grains had suffered less from direct neglect than from\r\nignorance of proper care.[117] The value of chemical pesticides was just\r\nbeginning to be understood (their use would not reach major proportions\r\nuntil the years after World War II) and Joseph Beard noted that the\r\nagents were frequently \"bombarded with all these new advertisements\r\ncoming from the supplier or chemical company....\"[118] The agents\r\nrefrained from recommending products that had not been tested for at\r\nleast three years at the State Agricultural Experiment Station, insuring\r\nsome safety in the pesticides, though Beard admitted that the principles\r\nof chemical buildup were not yet recognized.[119] Slowly word\r\ntravelled through the county of the advantages of protecting crops from\r\ndisease. By 1930 the program was progressing nicely, as Derr reported to\r\nthe state agency. Driving through the county one day, he met a\r\nsuccessful orchardist whom he had previously urged to use fungicides.\r\n\"Derr,\" the farmer remarked to him, \"you sure keep me busy; every time\r\nmy wife sees your spray notices she makes me get the machine out and go\r\nto work, but it surely does pay to spray.\"[120] Here too the farmer\r\nrelied on his own verification and judged personal experience stronger\r\nthan the words of experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A wild cherry tree destroyed by web worms. Insect pests\r\nsuch as these were a chief reason for the decline of orchards in the\r\narea. Photo in H. B. Derr Report, 1925, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax\r\nCounty Public Library.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this period of exciting and crucial advances in agricultural\r\nknowledge, the individual landowner was sometimes at a loss to, in his\r\nparlance, separate the wheat from the chaff. Radio programs, bulletins\r\nfrom the USDA and VPI, local newspaper columns and talks by visiting\r\nexperts all vied for the farmer's time, as did the news in _The Southern\r\nPlanter_, _Country Gentleman_ and _Farm Journal_, favorite periodicals in\r\nthe area. \"These programs came so rapidly the farmers just about got\r\nfamiliar with one until another appeared,\" Derr reported in 1936. \"As\r\none farmer put it, 'just one durned thing after another.\"[121]\r\nFurthermore, the information was often confusing, at odds with the\r\nhanded-down teachings of generations, or juxtaposed with other advice\r\nwith which it was dramatically opposed. The _Herndon News-Observer_, for\r\nexample, carried several articles on \"scientific feeding\" in its early\r\n1925 issues and advocated crop rotation and strict attention to\r\ncleanliness. Only a year later, however, it printed a column advising\r\nfarmers to feed kerosene and lard to hens to rid them of vermin.[122] In\r\nan even more blatant example, this paper contained an article written by\r\nVirginia state dairy specialist John A. Avery, which counseled area\r\nfarmers to increase their dairy herds; the same edition ran a piece by\r\nH. B. Derr which bemoaned the surplus of milk then glutting the\r\nWashington market.[123] It is not surprising that the farmer, caught in\r\nthe midst of a bewildering amount of concrete advice and misinformation,\r\nsometimes preferred to stick to his ancestors' ways. Thus, the old\r\nadages--that corn should be planted when the leaves were as large as\r\nsquirrel's ears, or that when a hen's comb isn't bright red, it isn't\r\nlaying--were relinquished with reluctance.[124] The only consistently\r\naccepted source on scientific farming seems to have been Virginia\r\nPolytechnical Institute's _Handbook of Agronomy_, which more than one\r\nfarmer stated he held in one hand while directing the plow with the\r\nother.[125]\r\n\r\nA particularly difficult question for the farmer to consider was the\r\nproblem of specialization. General farming had been the rule for so\r\nlong, and one-crop systems had such a reputation for running farms into\r\ndebt, that many were doubtful of the advantages of specialization. Here,\r\ntoo, they received mixed signals. On one hand farmers were advised to\r\nsink their all into poultry or dairying, only to hear that to\r\nconcentrate too completely on one area would limit their\r\nself-sufficiency and mitigate the integrated quality of the farm. In an\r\nincreasingly technical world, however, specialization had many\r\nattractions. Expensive machinery needed to be purchased for only one\r\nkind of production, the farmer could cut down the vast influx of\r\ninformation to only those subjects which directly interested him, and\r\nthe methods of mass production, first pioneered in factories, could be\r\napplied to his concentrated effort. Moreover, specialization in market\r\ncommodities produced the cash which had become ever more important to\r\nbuy equipment, pay taxes and purchase manufactured goods which were no\r\nlonger made on the farm. In the end, Fairfax County farmers generally\r\neffected a compromise: while focusing on one aspect of farming, they\r\nretained many of the advantages of the general farmer. Vegetable\r\ngardens, poultry houses, orchards, and sometimes sheep all kept their\r\nplace on the family farm. Even C. T. Rice, who liked to refer to his\r\nfarm as a milk producing plant, with \"little time or space for anything\r\nelse\" kept a few chickens and hogs.[126]\r\n\r\nAn early specialization in the county was truck gardening. The long\r\ngrowing season and potential markets in Alexandria and Washington in\r\ntheory seemed to point to success in this field. The list of vegetables\r\nand fruits grown for the commercial market was impressive and included\r\npotatoes, corn, tomatoes, spinach, black-eyed peas, parsnips and\r\nrhubarb, apples and several varieties of berries.[127] One man even grew\r\nartichokes, making quite a substantial profit, but decided to move his\r\noperation to more productive soils in New Jersey.[128] Yet those who\r\nattempted raising large quantities of these crops found it difficult to\r\nshow clear profits. Fruit growers had to compete with the world-famous\r\nproduce of the Shenandoah Valley, whose strong cooperative organization\r\ngave an added advantage to the area's natural abundance. Hay and forage\r\ngrains were of decreasing importance in a country rapidly becoming\r\nenamored of the automobile. In addition, a slump in farm prices had\r\nbegun in 1920-21, the after-effect of the inflated agricultural revenues\r\nof the World War I years.\r\n\r\nA study of small truck farms in the Washington, D.C. area showed that\r\ndespite intensive labor and a double cropping system, a farmer was often\r\nclearing only $500 annually by raising produce for the city markets. The\r\nstudy concluded that it took \"the best management and a considerable\r\nknowledge of farm practice and markets\" to till such a farm to\r\nadvantage. On the smallest farms it was only the exceptional farmer who\r\ncould make more than a living without any outside source of income.[129]\r\n\r\nMarketing the produce was a special problem of truck farming. The\r\nvegetables had to be delivered and sold at the peak of their ripeness\r\nand their highly perishable nature made this somewhat difficult in the\r\ndays before refrigeration. It was generally undesirable to sell through\r\na middleman, and therefore the farmer was responsible for personally\r\nmarketing as well as raising his produce. Moreover, the trip to\r\nWashington was tedious and time consuming, especially in the early 1920s\r\nwhen the condition of the area's roads was at a notoriously low point.\r\nOne market farmer's trip was described in this way:\r\n\r\n     He planted all sorts of garden produce and he had what you'd call a\r\n     market wagon; it was a covered wagon.... During the day he would\r\n     fill that wagon with his produce and in the evening he would hook\r\n     his ... two horses to the wagon to get to Washington. He'd aim to\r\n     get there by six o'clock in the morning when the markets opened. He\r\n     would sell his produce as much as he could [directly from the\r\n     wagon] ... to individuals at the old Center Market.... They paid a\r\n     higher price. If he had any left over he had to sell it at whatever\r\n     he could get to the people who owned the stalls.... It took him\r\n     three or four hours ... to sell his load of produce. Then it was\r\n     the next night before he came home.[130]\r\n\r\nConditions at the city markets were also less than perfect as large\r\ncompanies tried to dump cheap produce from outside areas on the\r\nWashington consumer. Not only did they compete with the local farmer for\r\nthe lowest prices, but they misused the stall space itself. Even when a\r\nnew market was built in 1933, this remained a problem. One irate farmer\r\nangrily stated to the editor of the _Herndon News-Observer_ that the large\r\nretail trucks held all the available spaces while the area farmers\r\n\"stand out doors (sic) all day and part of the night, trying to eke out\r\nmoney for taxes, interest and other arbitrary costs.\" The streets were\r\nfilthy, he continued, and the market protection itself inadequate. \"The\r\nonly pretense of shelter barely covers the sidewalk, leaving the\r\nfarmer's truck or car outdoors where produce is in danger from heat,\r\ncold, or rain.\"[131]\r\n\r\nPartially because of these problems, the specialty which gained in\r\ndistinction and profitability at this time was dairy farming. There were\r\nseveral additional reasons for this. The land itself was well adapted to\r\nthe raising of milk cows; its gently undulating terrain--which formed\r\nnumerous natural water depressions--coupled with the abundance of small\r\nstreams or \"runs,\" made water easily available. To the dairy farmer who\r\nmust water his stock regardless of seasonal conditions, this was\r\nessential. As previously mentioned, Fairfax County also possessed soil\r\ntypes which worked up well and produced high yields of the pasturage and\r\nensilage crops required to support large dairy herds. And, one observer\r\nnoted, the weather was favorable for the dairy industry: \"The winters\r\nare relatively short in Fairfax, thus allowing cattle to stay out often\r\nuntil the latter part of November, returning to pasture by April or\r\nMay.\"[132]\r\n\r\nThese natural assets tell only part of the story for, as stated above,\r\nFairfax County continually produced well above the state per acre\r\naverage in both corn and orchard fruits and its market crops were\r\nconsiderably varied as late as 1920. Although dairying required more\r\ncapital initially and more land than did market gardening, it held an\r\nadvantage in that the plummeting farm prices did not affect milk\r\nproducts as disasterously as crops. The really great asset that the\r\nFairfax County dairy industry possessed, however, was its proximity to\r\nthe large milk-consuming markets in Alexandria and Washington, D.C., and\r\nthe speedy access afforded by rail lines connecting the two areas. Where\r\ntruck farmers needed to sell their produce personally in order to make\r\nthe best profit, milk producers sold to distributors, who collected at\r\nthe depot, making rail transportation a feasible marketing device.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days of the century milk was shipped by boat to the city\r\nmarkets, but the lack of river access for many farms and the ease of\r\nspoilage on this slow mode of transportation retarded the growth of the\r\ncommercial milk market. It was not until the old and unreliable steam\r\nrailway lines, such as the Washington and Old Dominion Railway, were\r\nconverted to electricity around 1912 and refrigerated cars were widely\r\nused, that the shipment of milk became really profitable.[133]\r\nCommunities such as Floris, situated only a few miles from the Herndon\r\ndepot, began to flourish as dairy centers when only a few years earlier\r\npoor transportation would have made marketing of such a highly\r\nperishable product unthinkable. So successful and rapid was the dairy\r\nboom that by 1924 over 1,800 gallons of milk were shipped daily from the\r\ncounty to Washington, and its production was the highest in\r\nVirginia.[134]\r\n\r\nOther factors served to enhance the burgeoning dairy industry. Around\r\n1910 milk pasteurization and bottling plants were established in\r\nWashington. This created a large market for whole milk, which had\r\nformerly been held in suspicion by many people who believed milk to be a\r\ncarrier of disease. Another important aspect was the well-directed\r\nefforts of the two county agricultural extension agents who, in addition\r\nto introducing the previously mentioned Dairy Herd Improvement\r\nAssociations, encouraged the use of pure-bred bulls for breeding, often\r\nacquiring the free loan of USDA animals for the purpose. The use of\r\nthese bulls was an added incentive for farmers to pay the nominal fee\r\nand join the Dairy Herd Improvement Associations, since membership was\r\nrequired in order to borrow a government animal. By these methods and\r\nrepeated admonitions to \"get out of the scrub class and join the\r\npure-bred bunch,\" the county agents helped Fairfax farmers develop so\r\nfine a reputation for quality dairy cows that buyers came from many\r\nstates to procure these high-testing animals for their farms.[135]\r\n\r\nAnother factor affecting the rise of dairying in Fairfax County was the\r\nearly formation of the Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association.\r\nThe organization had been informally started in 1907 as a clearinghouse\r\nfor grievances among some producers in the vicinity of Washington, D.C.,\r\nbut for many years it \"amounted to little more than an occasional\r\ngeneral meeting for the purpose of some united effort toward raising the\r\nprice of milk.\"[136] In 1920 it was incorporated and a full-time manager\r\nemployed. Each member paid a fee of one cent per gallon of milk sold (a\r\nfund which was accumulated and refunded when a farmer left the\r\norganization) and the Association handled the business of selling to the\r\ndistributors in Washington. By such collective action the dairymen were\r\nable to control milk prices more effectively, and their unity assured a\r\nmeasure of security against unscrupulous action by distributors. In the\r\nearly years of Fairfax County dairying this was a very real threat as\r\nformer Association member Holden Harrison attests:\r\n\r\n     There were four or five principal distributors in Washington. I\r\n     don't know whether they got together on this or not, but to start\r\n     out with they had a two price program. They paid you more in the\r\n     winter than they did in the summer.... The dairy farmer was at the\r\n     mercy of the milk distributor then. They set prices just as low as\r\n     they thought the best dairyman could continue to produce.... The\r\n     distributors were about to starve the farmers out, that's what\r\n     brought it around. We weren't getting a fair deal. So when we\r\n     formed this Association the management of the Association could\r\n     say, 'We've got these farmers lined up. They pretty well depend on\r\n     us and we can pretty well tell them what to do.' Through that\r\n     leverage they could pretty well tell the distributors what to do,\r\n     too.[137]\r\n\r\nThe Association furthered its prestige--and its bargaining power--by\r\nwaging a battle against \"bootleg,\" or uninspected, milk being brought\r\ninto the area from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It had the additional\r\nadvantage of stabilizing prices so that the farmer with only a small\r\namount of milk for the market could compete with the larger producer\r\nwhose more economical methods had previously allowed him to undersell\r\nhis smaller neighbor. Better methods of testing and pasteurizing the\r\nmilk were also concerns and the cooperative used its muscle to negotiate\r\nloans for its members.[138]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the late 1920s, the Association became concerned about\r\nthe drop in prices due to an overabundance of milk in the area and\r\ndeveloped a system of handling the surplus. \"It eventually built itself\r\ninto a position where the Association itself either rented or purchased\r\na plant that could take care of surplus milk...,\" stated Holden\r\nHarrison. \"This surplus milk was processed into cheese or butter or ice\r\ncream or maybe even powdered milk.... They had a plant in Frederick,\r\nMaryland, and they would divert whatever amount of producers' milk to\r\nFrederick to the processing plant and keep it out of the hands of the\r\ndistributors.\"[139] This action had the double advantage of avoiding\r\nwaste and preventing a profit-lowering glut of milk.\r\n\r\nBy 1927 the Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association was the\r\nlargest farmer's cooperative in Virginia. It included 85% of the\r\nWashington area producers in its membership, despite the effort of\r\ndistributors to dissuade some of the better producers from joining. They\r\nexercised bargaining control of over $2,500,000 annually. Though they\r\nnever actually went on strike, their large membership fund gave them a\r\nstrong bargaining position. \"The distributors knew when that fund\r\naccumulated to a good-sized sum that we weren't just a fly-by-night\r\noutfit that could be pushed around, that we had resources we could rely\r\non.\"[140] Furthermore, the organization wisely kept its clout by\r\navoiding political issues and exercising minimum control over individual\r\nmethods of production. Its purpose was to streamline the\r\ncommercialization of a farm product, and in this effort it was highly\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nNorthern Virginia's reputation for dairy excellence grew both in local\r\ncircles and throughout the state as a result of published census reports\r\nand statewide comparisons of milk volume and butterfat content. The 1925\r\nagricultural census shows Fairfax County to be the largest producer in\r\nthe state, with average yield per cow 70% above the statewide figure; in\r\n1940 this margin was even greater.[141] Dairy Herd Improvement\r\nAssociation #1, based in the Herndon area, had especially impressive\r\nresults. In 1935, for example, it had the second highest overall average\r\nin Virginia and included four of the state's five most productive herds.\r\nIn 1937 the county's high-testing cow, a Holstein owned by Dr. F. W.\r\nHuddleston, gave 2,031 pounds of milk (8.6 pounds to a gallon) per month\r\nto a statewide average of 620.[142]\r\n\r\nAs a result of these impressive showings, many local farmers shied away\r\nfrom general farming and began to put their energies into milk\r\nproduction; new farmers were drawn to the area specifically for the\r\npossibilities in dairy farming. Of ten families interviewed in the\r\nFloris area, all save one connected their family's removal to Fairfax\r\nCounty to the combination of transportation ease and excellent prices\r\nafforded by the Washington milk market. \"In this period there was an\r\nimmigration of farmers from other parts of the country, particularly in\r\nthe Valley of Virginia, who did not have an opportunity to market their\r\nfarm products and their livestock very readily up there in the Valley,\"\r\nrelated Joseph Beard, \"... the Southern Railway, the Richmond,\r\nFredericksburg and Potomac [Railways were] quite an asset to people who\r\nwanted to market their farm products so a lot of them moved up\r\nhere.\"[143] Many of the newcomers became outstanding in the field of\r\ndairy husbandry, for example, C. T. Rice, a celebrated dairy owner of\r\nthe Oakton area, whose animals consistently scored highly on milk\r\nproduction. He came to the county in 1915 but \"threw away his plow\"\r\nduring the 1920s to concentrate solely on dairying, citing erosion\r\nproblems and the more constant income of dairying as his reasons.[144]\r\nSo widespread was this tendency to embrace dairy farming that a\r\ntraveller riding through the county in 1930 sensed that \"it is not\r\nfarming country at all, because there is very little planting done. We\r\nsaw few fields in which a crop had been recently harvested ... it is\r\napparently a grazing country.\"[145]\r\n\r\nDespite its spectacular achievements, the Fairfax County dairy industry\r\ndid not rise with an unchecked ascent but suffered a certain share of\r\nproblems and setbacks. In one sense its very success was its worst\r\nenemy. Although many farmers continued to focus on dairying, by 1926\r\nthere was a surplus of milk on the Washington market and the county\r\nagent noted that \"it appears as if we had sufficient dairies.\"[146]\r\nStill, while prices dropped steadily between 1926 and 1935,[147] farmers\r\ncontinued to increase their yields in hopes of increasing profits by\r\nshear quantities of milk sold. One county farmer commenting on the\r\nfutility of this, remarked:\r\n\r\n     We were getting about 25c a gallon for our base milk. Seventy-five\r\n     gallons a day at 25c a gallon wasn't paying the interest and the\r\n     mortgage on [his farm loan]. So we decided in 1928 that we would\r\n     put in some more cows and get a little extra money to help pay off\r\n     this mortgage and this loan. So we started shipping, instead of 75\r\n     gallons of milk a day, 90 to 95 gallons of milk a day. Then milk\r\n     went down from 25c a gallon to 22c a gallon. Well, we couldn't do\r\n     that, so we put some more stalls on the barn and built a new silo\r\n     and put in enough cows to ship 125 gallons of milk a day ... it was\r\n     only netting us 18 to 19c a gallon ... the more we worked, the more\r\n     we produced, and the harder we worked, it seemed like the less net\r\n     income we had.[148]\r\n\r\nAgainst this turn of events the state agricultural service advocated\r\npoultry and truck farming for those entering the county and urged a more\r\nuniform distribution of the county's cattle. Some farmers had too few\r\ncows for even their own use. Others had too many and no feed. \"A few\r\ngood cows well kept, rather than a large number poorly fed, will bring\r\nin a steady income, that will do much for our farmers in their present\r\nconditions,\" advised County Agent Derr.[149] He also hoped to see\r\nfarmers concentrate on the butterfat content of their milk and to\r\nincrease their production of cream for which there was a continual\r\nmarket; the skim milk left after the removal of cream could be fed to\r\ncalves, pigs or children. Most often Derr cautioned against the dangers\r\nof complete specialization at the expense of an integrated farm in which\r\neach facet of the farm was both aided and benefitted by every other\r\npart. \"The old slogan, 'the cow, the sow and the hen,' is a very true\r\none,\" he wrote, \"especially in the South.\"[150]\r\n\r\nDerr did well to emphasize the quality of milk products. A 1932 ruling\r\nin the District of Columbia requiring a 4% butterfat content in milk\r\nsold there occurred just as Derr was complaining that \"with many the\r\nquality of the milk is not such a vital question as the quantity.\"\r\nHolstein cattle, which gave higher yields but less rich milk than did\r\nJerseys or Guernseys, predominated in the county, making the new demand\r\na difficult one to meet. In desperation some farmers tried\r\ncross-breeding the two strains with mixed results; the inevitable\r\noutcome was to compromise the county's movement towards establishing\r\nherds of pure-bred animals.[151]\r\n\r\nThe mixing of breeds to increase butterfat content was not the only\r\nelement which undercut the breeding program. One problem, the selling of\r\nhighly profitable animals, was yet another hazard of success. \"Owing to\r\nthe excellent reports being made by our cow testing associations,\r\nnumerous buyers from other states have come into the county and by\r\npaying almost fabulous prices have taken away quite a number of our best\r\nanimals,\" Derr wrote in 1926. \"In some cases this has proved a costly\r\nundertaking for our dairymen, as by bringing new animals into their\r\nherds ... either T B or abortion has been introduced.\"[152] Another\r\nfactor working against pure-bred stock was the depression, which for\r\nfarmers encompassed not only the 1930s, but the entire period following\r\nthe deflation of World War I prices. With less cash available, many\r\nfarmers bought poor quality bulls rather than invest the money for a\r\npure-bred animal.[153]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these setbacks, dairy farming continued to be Fairfax\r\nCounty's predominant (and most prestigious) industry during the 1920s\r\nand 1930s. Indeed, it flourished well into the 1950s and was eclipsed\r\nonly by the overwhelming spread of urban workers into the area in the\r\nsecond half of the century. Until this development occurred, it was the\r\ndairy farmer's life which set the style and pace of life in the county.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMechanization and specialization of the family farm did not necessarily\r\nlighten the farmer's workload. An electric machine could cut several\r\nhours per week off milking time, but this time gain was offset by the\r\nhours spent on sterilization and maintenance. Threshers eliminated the\r\ntime-consuming chore of hand-flailing the grain, but the farmer still\r\nhad to cut and stack his harvest, and it took several men a number of\r\ndays to run the machine. The grower was at the mercy of the machine's\r\nowner as to the day and time he was able to thresh; here again, he lost\r\na measure of independence.[154] The excellent efforts of the Dairy Herd\r\nImprovement Associations also produced work for the farmers, especially\r\nthose unaccustomed to bookkeeping. The landowner who had kept his\r\nrecords in an old shoe box was now expected to record the precise weight\r\nand butterfat content of the milk given by each cow, as well as the\r\nmarket value, number of days tested and amount and cost of grain fed the\r\nanimal. The data shown in the Herd Record Books belonging to C. T. Rice\r\nreveal them to be complex documents which required in addition to the\r\nabove information, hereditary records, descriptions of physical\r\nfeatures, and yearly and monthly production averages.[155] The efforts\r\nwere rewarding, of course, but, added to the farmer's already overloaded\r\nday, the recordkeeping could be burdensome. Both Agents Derr and Beard\r\ncomplained constantly of the farmer's reluctance to keep records and in\r\ntheir attempts to increase the area's professional methods and pride,\r\nthey stressed the need to keep accurate accounts of the farm's\r\ntransactions.[156]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe advent of technological application in the farming sector was a\r\ncause of both optimism and disquiet. It eliminated some drudgery, it\r\nstreamlined and modernized, but it also uprooted traditions and added\r\nfinancial and emotional burdens to the already pressured farmer. To cope\r\nwith the new agricultural methods and outlook, farmers increasingly\r\nchose to relinquish some of their independence and band together to\r\nsolve their problems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Hard Work Made Easy and Quick\" wrote a local farmer on\r\nthe back of this photograph.

This expertise made for occupational prestige and\r\nincreased status in non-farm communities; acknowledgment of the farmer\r\nas a professional developed markedly during the 1920s and 1930s.\r\nDetailed knowledge had been essential to the general farmer but it was\r\nnot widely recognized as a specialized skill. The professionalization\r\ntaking place was also due to the farmer's own recognition of his unique\r\nrole and his attempts to enhance it through farmer's clubs, educational\r\nopportunities and community projects. It also reflected a larger concern\r\nin the nation with upgrading standards and promoting solidarity among\r\ndiscrete occupational groups, a remnant from the movement towards\r\nefficiency and proficiency of the Progressive Era.[157]\r\n\r\nAn important advance for the farmer was the increased opportunities in\r\nagricultural education. The Hatch Act had provided for agricultural\r\nprograms to be established in the Land Grant Colleges, and ensuing\r\nlegislation in 1917 called for farm courses to be added to the high\r\nschool curriculum.[158] This significant step was resisted for a short\r\ntime in Fairfax County, where the school board preferred to teach Latin\r\nrather than agriculture in the schools, a policy held in disdain by\r\nlocal farmers: \"Latin was of no use unless you want to go around the\r\nbarn and swear at some creature in an old language.\"[159] When\r\nvocational training was finally adopted in 1919, the chances for farm\r\nchildren to keep up with the burgeoning technology and sharpen their\r\nacquired skills were immeasurably increased. In Virginia practical\r\nskills were taught but so were a program of social studies dealing with\r\nthe quality of life in rural areas, focusing on problems of\r\ntransportation, recreation, resource protection and consumption\r\npatterns.[160] Such official sanction for agricultural education was a\r\nrecognition that farming was not merely a plodding or unskilled\r\nactivity, but an exacting science which required intelligence and\r\napplication to master.\r\n\r\nExtensive study of agriculture in high school or college was the ideal,\r\nof course, but a number of programs were developed to further the\r\nestablished farmer's basic skills. Ray Harrison went to Baltimore to\r\ntake a farmer's course in veterinary medicine and Wilson D. McNair\r\ntravelled all the way to New Brunswick, New Jersey, to learn the most\r\nadvanced methods of poultry farming. McNair later enrolled in a two-year\r\ncourse at VPI. Another farmer, Fred Curtice, from the Navy area, had\r\ndegrees from Cornell University and took veterinary courses from George\r\nWashington University.[161] The county agent also designed extension\r\nschools for interested farmers. In February, 1933, for example, a\r\ntwo-day poultry school was attended by 75 farmers who heard reports by\r\nlocal farmers, talks by experts from USDA and VPI and workshops on\r\ntopics such as \"Egg Grading,\" \"Growing the Pullets,\" and \"The Poultry\r\nOutlook for Virginia.\"[162] Less intensive programs were also offered,\r\nsuch as the free showing of a dairy-oriented film, \"Safeguarding the\r\nFoster Mothers of the World.\" \"A profitable evening is promised,\"\r\nannounced the film's advertisement, \"especially to those interested in\r\nthe economical production of milk by up-to-date methods.\"[163]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Fairfax County Grange meeting at a schoolhouse near\r\nFairfax, c. 1940. Photo, Library of Congress.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps of even greater benefit to the farmer's image and expertise was\r\nthe growth of local farmer's organizations and cooperatives. The largest\r\nand most prominent nationally was the Grange, a farmer's association\r\ninitially started in Washington, D.C., in 1867. Fairfax County boasted\r\nfour chapters of this organization, formed in the late years of the\r\n1920s. The Grange interested itself in agricultural activities and civic\r\nmatters and it was upon its recommendation that the county agent was\r\nappointed.[164] Of more immediate concern, however, were the local\r\nfarmer's clubs, and the unofficial associations of orchardists or\r\ndairymen who met to discuss surpluses, crop problems or the need to\r\nadvertise. The farmer's clubs were the outgrowth of community groups\r\nwhich sprang up spontaneously in the county from the mid-nineteenth\r\ncentury on, but which were expanded and formalized by H. B. Derr in the\r\nmid-1920s. As he described them they were\r\n\r\n     unique in their plans in that they are composed of twelve families\r\n     and they meet once a year at each home.... They meet in time for\r\n     dinner and after dinner ... the men go over the farm and discuss\r\n     current farm problems. Then they return to the house and listen to\r\n     some speaker who has been invited for an informal talk.[165]\r\n\r\nBroadening and sociable, the clubs became an outstanding feature of\r\nFairfax County farm organization.\r\n\r\nThe minutes from the meetings of Farmer's Club #1, which was based in\r\nHerndon and was made up predominantly of members from the Floris area,\r\nshow the variety of subjects discussed. A meeting in March, 1921,\r\nincluded a lecture on contagious abortion (a disease chiefly affecting\r\ndairy cows). Road conditions were discussed in April, 1924. Problems of\r\nmilk cooling and the effectiveness of the agricultural high school were\r\ntopics in March, 1928, and the following month state legislator H. E.\r\nHanes addressed the club on farm issues and voting procedures in the\r\nupcoming elections. The club members also joined together to buy seed\r\nin quantity in order to reduce cost and effort.\r\n\r\nInformative as the meetings were, of equal importance was the bond of\r\nfriendship and professional affiliation which the farmer's clubs\r\nfostered. By working closely with men of similar interests, a network\r\nwas built up which increased the agriculturalists' pride and\r\neffectiveness; not only could the farmer identify with the attitudes and\r\nproblems of his associates, but could work with them to fulfill mutual\r\nneeds. The sincere respect felt among members of this group is shown in\r\nthe following tribute, written after the death of one associated farmer,\r\nS. L. Chapin:\r\n\r\n     Be it resolved: That we pause to drop a tear of sympathy and love,\r\n     to express in our humble way the deep feeling of our loss. Bold and\r\n     fearless in the expression of his opinion, kind and considerate at\r\n     all times, and under all conditions. His life and association with\r\n     his fellow men were full of love and tenderness.... To his bereaved\r\n     family we tender our deepest sympathy and may the recolections\r\n     (sic) of his cheerful disposition ever remain fresh in our\r\n     memories, as we recall many pleasant incidents of his\r\n     associations.[166]\r\n\r\nAs farmers organized, they reinforced their own values and occupational\r\nidentity, and what is more, they combined their efforts to work for the\r\nchange they sought most. The Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers\r\nAssociation is an obvious example of this. Smaller cooperatives, many of\r\nthem outgrowths of the farmer's clubs, sprang up throughout the county,\r\nthough none of them had the longevity or impact of the Maryland and\r\nVirginia Milk Producers Association. A Floris Milk Producers Association\r\nwas founded in 1925 to operate and repair milk collecting trucks and the\r\nDairy Marketing Company and Fairfax County Farmer's Service Company\r\n(which featured cooperative buying of seed) started a few years later.\r\nNone of these bodies remained permanent features of the area's\r\norganizations, but all helped the farmer to see the advantage of\r\ncollective effort. The professional attitude adopted by the farmers'\r\ngroups is evident in the stringent standards required in their service\r\ncontracts. No longer was an informal gentleman's agreement sufficient.\r\nFarmers expected seed to be of a certain weight and quality, milk to be\r\ndelivered \"at a coolness satisfactory to the dealer,\" and sanitary\r\nmeasures to be strictly followed.[167] In effect the cooperative\r\nmovement enlarged the farmer's working partners to include not only his\r\nfamily and hired labor, but the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Floris Home Demonstration Club, 1930 winners of the\r\nCounty Championship for most effective club.

Working\r\njointly with the agricultural agent was a \"home demonstration agent\" who\r\ngave advice, lectures and demonstrations geared toward increased economy\r\nand convenience for the homemaker. Home Demonstration Clubs were\r\norganized in each community to acquaint farm women with the newest\r\nresearch on food preservation, household efficiency and organizational\r\nskills. Courses in fancy needlework and cake-baking were sometimes\r\nfeatured but the home demonstration agents' work more frequently took a\r\npragmatic bent. The seriousness with which the homemaker was regarded,\r\nand the new image of professionalism which she hoped to evoke is\r\nevidenced in the schedule of classes led by agent Lucy Blake in early\r\n1938:\r\n\r\n  January   Home Lighting and Wiring\r\n  February  The Homemaker as Planner--Her Job and the Planning Center\r\n  March     Schedules and Deadlines\r\n  April     Citizenship\r\n  May       The Homemaker as Handyman\r\n  June      The Homemaker as Buyer[168]\r\n\r\nIn addition, the clubs raised money for neighborhood beautification and\r\nworked on community projects. The Floris Club annually canned fruits,\r\nvegetables and meats for a hot school lunch program and also donated\r\ntheir time to serve it. As in the more male-oriented Farmer's Clubs, the\r\norganizations fostered pride and identity among the farm women, as well\r\nas concretely improving conditions on the farm.[169]\r\n\r\nThe home demonstration agent also ran the county's 4-H clubs, branches\r\nof a nationwide organization founded in 1903. Four-H members dedicated\r\ntheir \"heads, hearts, hands and health\" to improving rural conditions;\r\nthe club's goal was to give practical training to children whose life\r\nwas likely to be spent on the farm. Boys were schooled in agronomy,\r\nmechanics and animal husbandry and pursued individual projects in these\r\nfields. Girls also worked both with groups and individually in such\r\nareas as \"food for health,\" clothes remodeling and room improvement.\r\nSummer camps, rallies and fairs were also sponsored by 4-H Clubs. At one\r\ncamp, held near Woodlawn, the week-long program included workshops in\r\ncanning, basketry and utilization of dairy products, a sidetrip to see\r\nfireworks, and those perennial camp favorites of swimming, \"weenie\r\nroasts\" and stunt nights.[170]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The 4-H Girls Camp at Woodlawn. Fewer boys were able to\r\nattend such camps since their labor was needed on the farm. Photo in H.\r\nB. Derr Report, 1925, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The cream of the crop of Fairfax County girlhood on a\r\nfloat meant for the Piedmont Dairy Festival parade. Photo in H. B. Derr\r\nReport, 1930, Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public Library.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 4-H Clubs never caught on in Fairfax County to the satisfaction of\r\nthe home demonstration and agricultural agents. \"The past year has not\r\nbeen a banner year for club work,\" wrote Derr in 1926. \"Four clubs were\r\norganized ... but the agent is inclined to think that with a number of\r\n[members] this was done to be excused from a study period. The small\r\namount of work done on their projects seems to substantiate this\r\nbelief.\"[171] The clubs grew slowly partly because they overlapped the\r\nwork of the Floris Vocational High School and the Future Farmers of\r\nAmerica Club, founded in 1927.[172] There is also some evidence that\r\nparents were reluctant to release their children from farm work to\r\nattend meetings.[173] For those who did join, the meetings seem to have\r\nbeen fun and profitable. \"Not only do you learn from 4-H how to make a\r\nhome and a living,\" an enthusiastic member commented in 1933, \"but you\r\nalso learn how to make life worthwhile. We now realize more than ever\r\nour duties, as the child of today will be the adult of tomorrow.\"[174]\r\n\r\nAs is evident in the above quotation, groups such as the 4-H or Future\r\nFarmers of America encouraged a child to identify with and improve on\r\nrural life. These organizations not only stressed occupational pride,\r\nbut benefitted the community by training leaders who had early\r\nexperience with professional farming techniques.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAside from the need to influence milk and produce prices, two chief\r\nconcerns of the farmer's organizations were the establishment of\r\nelectricity throughout the county and the improvement of the area's\r\nroads. The move towards rural electrification was a popular one across\r\nthe nation, cited continually as the one item most useful to the farmer\r\nfor advancing mechanization and of greatest importance in raising the\r\nfarm family's standard of living. With electricity the family could use\r\na radio, rid themselves of smoky kerosene lighting and enjoy the use of\r\nmore efficient and cleaner stoves and refrigeration. The pragmatic\r\ndesire for electrical equipment to operate milking machines and water\r\npumps was intensified by advertisements such as one which appeared in\r\nthe _Herndon News-Observer_ claiming that electricity would make life\r\n\"convenient and happy\" as well as add fifteen to twenty years to the\r\nfarm woman's life.[175]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the route to establishing electrical facilities in the\r\ncounty was not an easy one. Some farmers used small gasoline engines to\r\nproduce power, but these, the \"contrariest little machines,\" were\r\nunreliable and frequently too weak to run milking equipment. Derr\r\nreported that 98% of the farmers desired this convenience but the\r\nexpense seemed prohibitive. Commercial electric companies were reluctant\r\nto build lines through sparsely settled areas, and the farmers were\r\nforced to finance their own power plants. In 1933 the federal government\r\nbegan a program to subsidize local electrification programs and make\r\nthem financially viable the only drawback being the undue amount of red\r\ntape to go through involved in qualifying. \"The cost of building new\r\nlines was found to range from one thousand to two thousand dollars a\r\nmile,\" stated a discouraged Derr. \"We were hardly prepared to be told\r\nthat the farmers ... must organize a farm cooperative ... borrow the\r\nmoney from the Government and build their own lines to be\r\nself-liquidating in twenty years at 3% interest.\"[176] Difficult as the\r\nprocess seemed, the farmers had little choice if they hoped to electrify\r\ntheir neighborhoods. In this instance, an organization was not only an\r\nadvantage for success in furthering the community's amenities, but a\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nThat the Floris community was one of the earlier areas to enjoy the\r\nbenefits of electrification was a result of great effort on the part of\r\nits citizens. A franchise for an electric power plant was granted to\r\nHerndon in 1915 but never materialized, and prior to 1924 the nearest\r\ngenerating operation was in Alexandria.[177] A group of farmers from\r\nLoudoun and Fairfax Counties, headed by A. S. Harrison, hired an\r\nengineer and travelled throughout the Dranesville District to encourage\r\nfarmers to contribute time and money towards an electrical plant.\r\nEventually they raised enough cash to form a stock company and a power\r\nline was built between Alexandria and Herndon, and subsequently on to\r\nLeesburg.[178] The initiative shown by the Floris farmers was rewarded\r\nby a distinct advantage over non-electrified communities. As late as\r\n1940 over 35% of the county's farms were without electric power. A\r\nsurvey conducted in that year showed these non-electrified areas to be\r\nthe least productive, and most depressed in morale and way of life.[179]\r\n\r\nWater and sanitation systems were also difficult to establish despite\r\nconcerted efforts by the home demonstration agents. Slightly over 10% of\r\nthe county's farm homes contained \"complete water systems\" in 1932,\r\nthough a larger percentage had partial plumbing facilities. Even in\r\n1940, only 19% of the homes in the Dranesville area (and 40% in the\r\ncounty as a whole) boasted running water. Low as these figures seem,\r\nhowever, they were the highest in the state. Because good water was\r\nabundant in the area, farmers saw less need to campaign for extended\r\nwater mains or sewer lines, in spite of their advantages for health and\r\nconvenience. It was not until the population boom of World War II that\r\nreally modern utilities were established in the county on a large\r\nscale.[180]\r\n\r\nOf greater significance was the effort to better the county's road\r\nsystem. Southern roads in general--and Virginia's in particular--had\r\nbeen notorious since their inception for ruts, abrupt endings and,\r\nespecially, mud. In 1918 there were only a few miles of surfaced road in\r\nFairfax County, and any roadbuilding or repairs were made at the\r\ndiscretion of individual landowners.[181] The inconveniences caused by\r\nthe poor roads became legendary. One woman remembered the roads being so\r\nrough that eggs would break on the way to market, and another, Emma\r\nMillard, stated that conditions were bad enough that \"you would lose\r\nyour boots when you went through so much mud and had to go back and\r\nretrieve the boots.\"[182] When automobiles became more common on the\r\ncounty's thoroughfares, they increased the problem of dust, deeply worn\r\ngrooves and splashing muddy water. At the same time they pointed up the\r\nnecessity for improvement. The early solid tire vehicles could barely\r\noperate in the thick red Virginia mud, thus greatly retarding\r\ntransportation of produce and milk. \"If you had three drops of rain on\r\nthe road, [the tires] started spinning and you couldn't go anywhere much\r\nwithout chains,\" recollected one early farmer. \"Every truck carried a\r\nset of tire chains in the event it rained. In the summertime if it\r\nrained, you stuck right on the first little grade you hit.\" Not until\r\n1922 did farmers attempt to haul their goods in trucks, and even then\r\nthey \"broke more axles than anything else.\"[183]\r\n\r\nFarmers were acutely aware of the situation and some of their earliest\r\nunited efforts were focused on road improvement. Records of Farmer's\r\nClub #1 show the topic to be the subject of discussion at several\r\nmeetings a year, beginning in 1909. Initially they tried only to\r\ninterest the county in undertaking repairs but as conditions worsened,\r\nthe landowners began to appeal to county judges and the Board of\r\nSupervisors for bond issues to surface Little River Turnpike and other\r\nmain roads. Resolutions, such as the following from a Herndon-based\r\nclub, were regularly sent to government officials:\r\n\r\n     Resolved: That we, Farmer's Club #4 ... favor petitioning the\r\n     circuit judge of the county to order an election for the purpose of\r\n     determining whether bonds shall be issued for the sum of $50,000\r\n     for the construction of a macadam road from Little River Turnpike\r\n     at Chantilly to the Leesburg Pike at Dranesville, and as much more\r\n     as possible.[184]\r\n\r\nIn some cases the clubs even worked together to build their own\r\nroads.[185] After ten years of pressure by farm groups, a bond issue was\r\npresented to the voters to pave the Leesburg Pike, the road from\r\nChantilly to Herndon which ran through Floris, and a thoroughfare\r\nextending beyond Herndon to Mock Corner. The weight with which area\r\nresidents viewed this issue is shown in a statement made by the Herndon\r\nChamber of Commerce: \"If this bond issue fails, it will be the greatest\r\ncalamity that has befallen this community in many years.\" Happily the\r\nbond issue did pass and this, plus the statewide road program sponsored\r\nunder the leadership of Governor Harry F. Byrd from 1926 to 1930,\r\neliminated the bulk of the road problems. Only a few years later, in\r\n1928, Fairfax was one of the foremost counties in Virginia in the area\r\nof transportation, with over 160 miles of surfaced roads.[186]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Improved and unimproved roads in the Herndon area, c.\r\n1930.

Conscientious and efficient as\r\nthe farmers had tried to be, the county had worn a rather untidy\r\nappearance for several years. A traveler observed that \"the fences are\r\nnot as trigly mended or the buildings as trimly painted as in the\r\n[Shenandoah] Valley. A haystack is merely a pile of hay and not a neatly\r\nfashioned cock....\"[187] County agent Derr also admitted that \"in at\r\nleast 75 percent of the farm homes there is little or no attention to\r\nthe improvement of the home surroundings.\" The extension service worked\r\nvaliantly to mitigate this problem by offering courses in landscaping\r\nand home maintenance, but to their surprise they found that the chief\r\nstimulus to home improvement was the repair of roads. Those areas which\r\nappeared most untidy were found on unimproved thoroughfares, which Derr\r\nmaintained had a depressing effect on the farm family. \"There is a\r\ndirect correllation (sic),\" he noted, \"between the improvement of the\r\nroads and the painting and fixing up of things around the house.\"[188]\r\n\r\nAnother beneficial side effect of the surfaced highway network was the\r\nbirth of the roadside stand for selling surplus produce, dairy and\r\npoultry products. There were some distinct advantages to the stands, as\r\nfarmers could sell directly to the customer without the costly use of a\r\nmiddleman, and did not have to transport his goods to city consumers. A\r\ncount made in 1937 found 210 roadside stands in the county.[189]\r\nEarlier, the _Herndon News-Observer_ had reported the success of the new\r\nmarkets which lent themselves \"to the disposal of second-grade products\r\nor fruits and vegetables too ripe for distant shipping [and had] grown\r\nto an unusual business ... for the farmers fortunate enough to live\r\nalong popular highways.\" Business indeed seems to have been brisk; by\r\n1926 the farmers were pocketing over $2,000 per month from the roadside\r\nmarkets.[190]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNew discoveries in technology, educational opportunities and a\r\nrefurbished transportation network were naturally considered advances in\r\ntheir time; they could be loosely headed under the term \"progress.\" But\r\nprogress does not run along a perfectly straight path, rather it dips\r\nand weaves ignoring some people and places in its circuitous route.\r\nConsequently, many of the changes so eagerly embraced by the farmer of\r\nmodest means were the very factors which eventually crowded out the\r\nfamily farm. The farmers of Fairfax County were for the most part\r\nunaware of their impending doom, being instead optimistic and relatively\r\nprosperous during the 1920s and 1930s. But the small, varied and\r\npreindustrial farm could not compete for long against the lure of city\r\nwages, highly mechanized and specialized farms, and the inroads of the\r\ncity into rural areas.\r\n\r\nMechanization most drastically altered life on the family farm. Work\r\nrhythms and patterns, previously geared to hand labor, were disrupted,\r\nand even the sounds on the farm changed. Older cows, for example,\r\ndisliked the noise of the electric milking machines, and Wilson McNair\r\nwrote that\r\n\r\n     horses were generally scared of traction engines with their hissing\r\n     steam, etc. When the engine met a team it would stop and one man\r\n     would lead the horses by the bridle past the engine.... At the\r\n     railroad crossing in Herndon there was a bell that rung when a\r\n     train was coming. Our pony, if the bell was ringing when we crossed\r\n     the track coming home would break into a dead run. You couldn't\r\n     hold her.[191]\r\n\r\nTo the interim farmer, caught between completely automated equipment and\r\nthe tradition of hand labor, the change in work habits, knowledge and\r\ngoals could be more than vaguely disquieting.\r\n\r\nAs mechanization increased, many began to speak of agriculture in\r\nindustrial terms, believing that \"factorizing\" the farm would solve its\r\nproblems. This meant dispensing with any unnecessary tasks, such as\r\nraising sheep or making soap, and as much as possible replacing manpower\r\nwith machinery. Technical terminology started to creep into farm talk.\r\nC. T. Rice referred to his dairy as \"a milk producing plant,\"[192]\r\nancient terms such as \"culling\" became \"selective breeding,\" and even\r\nthe animals were referred to as machines, which if \"poorly constructed\r\nmust be ... discarded by the good breeder.\"[193] To independent-minded\r\nfarmers, who, as Sinclair Lewis had observed, jealously guarded the\r\nability to escape the mill and turmoil of the city, this\r\nindustrialization seemed the ultimate compromise. The findings of the\r\nCommission to study the Condition of the Farmers of Virginia (1930) show\r\nthe rural values of a most fundamental character to be those most prized\r\nby the agriculturalist:\r\n\r\n     Among these are: a) The advantages of the country for bringing up a\r\n     family ... a greater sharing of responsibilities, a closer knit,\r\n     more stable family life.... b) The satisfactions ... of contacts\r\n     with forces of nature, of caring for plants and animals, and of\r\n     seeing them grow.... c) Greater freedom from various types of\r\n     restraints, including somewhat greater control over time and\r\n     freedom of personal action; also less intense struggle to keep up\r\n     with or ahead of others.... d) somewhat greater freedom from\r\n     illness, together with a better prospect of attaining old age. e)\r\n     Greater security against unemployment as well as less prospect of\r\n     falling into absolute want.[194]\r\n\r\nYet in the post-World War I period the farmer had increasingly to\r\ncommercialize and mechanize his business to remain solvent and to\r\n\"citify\" his life, destroying in numerous instances the standards he\r\nheld dear.\r\n\r\n\"I used to 'farm' some and made money at it; now I'm 'engaged in the\r\npursuit of agriculture' and can't make ends meet,\" commented one U. S.\r\nSecretary of Agriculture, echoing the sentiments of many small\r\nlandowners.[195] The new farm mechanization was, in many cases, not\r\nparticularly well adapted to the family farm in this period.\r\nGasoline-powered tractors, harvesters and other equipment worked most\r\neconomically on the large, level acres of midwestern farms, and the east\r\ncoast farmer with modest landholdings could not hope to compete on the\r\nmarket with the streamlined efficiency of western farms. Mechanized\r\nfarming was also capital intensive. Besides the initial cost of\r\nequipment there were expenses for maintenance and fuel. Whereas the\r\nfarmer had been able to raise feed for horses or mules inexpensively, he\r\ncould not grow gasoline.\r\n\r\nFarmers usually had to borrow money to purchase equipment and sometimes\r\nthey over-indulged. \"I know one or two that did,\" said Joseph Beard.\r\n\r\n     When you have several thousand dollars invested in machinery, and\r\n     you only use it three, five, ten, fifteen days a year, the rest of\r\n     the time it's sitting idle ... it would have been ... better if\r\n     they had hired their work done from someone else rather than put\r\n     that much into it.[196]\r\n\r\nMore cash was needed to buy manufactured goods as the farm became less\r\nself-supporting, but prices for raw materials remained low during the\r\nagricultural slump of the 1920s and 1930s. \"Agriculture was much less\r\ndistressed when the farm was a self-supporting home,\" reflected the\r\n_Washington Star_:\r\n\r\n     But when factories began producing commodities in quantity the\r\n     farmer could buy them easier than he could make them at home.\r\n\r\n     At first glance this looks like an admirable situation. But the\r\n     hitch arose when the farmer found himself unable to maintain a fair\r\n     basis of exchange.[197]\r\n\r\nThe result was that many farms of long-standing ownership had to be\r\nmortgaged. In the space of one year (between 1924 and 1925) county\r\nmortgages rose a dramatic 30% and by 1940 they had risen another\r\n20%.[198] Worse yet, a small but significant number of farmers and farm\r\nlaborers were beginning to leave the countryside altogether to work in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Kidwell farm and Floris vicinity shown in an aerial\r\nphotograph taken in 1937. Photo, National Archives and Records Service.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe county's improved transportation system was partially responsible\r\nfor this. Access to markets had been facilitated by surfaced roads but\r\nan easy avenue to city jobs was also opened. Short and regular hours,\r\nhigher pay and city amenities were strong attractions to the farmer who\r\nhad had to work \"from daybreak to backbreak\" for a scanty living.[199]\r\nIn recognition of this problem, Derr wrote plaintively in his annual\r\nreport of 1925:\r\n\r\n     The worst feature is the fact that our small farmers in the main\r\n     have such a hard time to get along that many of them are actually\r\n     training their children along more lucrative lines, and occupations\r\n     other than farming. Many of these farmers have sold their farms or\r\n     abandoned their leases and moved into the cities and are earning\r\n     more money per day than they made per week in the country. Another\r\n     important factor in this exodus from the farm is the fact that so\r\n     many of our farm boys with good health and strength, and not afraid\r\n     of hard work are making good in the city.[200]\r\n\r\nContinuing on, Derr quoted one discouraged farmer: \"One of my daughters\r\nis making 22 dollars a week, and my wife is talking of getting a job\r\ntoo. My wife can earn more in the city than I am getting so I guess I\r\nwill take care of the house and let them go to work.\"[201]\r\n\r\nIronically, additions such as electrification, intended to improve the\r\nrural standard of living, seem to have done little to check the\r\nmigration. USDA and United Nations studies show that the very amenities\r\nwhich should have made life in the country more attractive often\r\nresulted in a large flow of the population towards urban areas, a trend\r\nwhich continues today in developing countries. Even increased education,\r\nwhich had as its goal professional quality in agricultural training,\r\nsometimes simply broadened the farmer to possibilities outside his own\r\nrealm. Sociologists and agriculturalists have found these repercussions\r\npuzzling and have not discovered clear-cut reasons for them. Perhaps\r\nwith country and city life being ever homogenized by the use of radios,\r\nautomobiles, consumer goods and the interflow of people, the step of\r\nleaving the farm to try city life seemed less foreign and formidable. In\r\nFairfax County the proximity of Washington and Alexandria made it\r\nespecially tempting.[202]\r\n\r\nIt was not only farm owners who left home for city jobs, but the farm\r\nlaborers. The effect of this exodus was devastating to the county's\r\nsmall farmer. Initially the scarcity of help meant cutting back\r\nadditional farm activities, the products of which were not earmarked for\r\nthe market. Rebecca Middleton remembered, for instance, that farmers\r\nstopped raising their own hogs chiefly because of the difficulty of\r\nhiring laborers to help with butchering.[203] As labor shortages grew,\r\nthe available help raised their prices significantly, eventually\r\noutpricing themselves for most farmers. As Joseph Beard observed, this\r\ntrend did not affect Fairfax County in a really dramatic way until after\r\nWorld War II, \"by virtue of the fact that most farmers raised anywhere\r\nfrom two to five children. Most every farmer's hired hand raised from\r\ntwo to five children. Now there just wasn't room on this farm to employ\r\nten to twelve children.\" With such large families the drain to\r\nWashington did not so clearly affect the farms at the outset.[204]\r\nNevertheless, the trend retains its significance, for the high cost of\r\nlabor, which contributed greatly to the demise of the self-supporting\r\nfarm, had its roots in the optimistic improvement of transportation\r\nsystems in the second and third decades of the century.[205]\r\n\r\nThe improved roads carried yet another liability: an increase in land\r\nvalue and the consequent rise in taxation. In 1923 the average acre in\r\nthe county was worth $5 to $10; it had more than doubled in value by the\r\nend of that decade.[206] Taxes rose accordingly. The editors of the\r\n_Fairfax Herald_ complained in 1926 that in addition to the cost of living\r\nwhich had risen 78% from 1913, they paid federal taxes which were 200%\r\nover the pre-World War I figure.[207] The farmer also carried the burden\r\nof cost for his much-desired roads. In addition to bond issues, there\r\nwas a Virginia state gasoline tax which fell heavily on the farmer with\r\nhis gas-driven machinery and need to haul produce to market.[208]\r\nTaxation, like labor, machinery and manufactured goods, called for\r\nadditional cash, which was more and more difficult for the family farmer\r\nto raise. \"There's only one thing that has driven the dairy industry out\r\nof Fairfax County, and that's taxes,\" concluded Holden Harrison. \"The\r\nland was suitable, the location was suitable, but who's going to run a\r\ndairy on $10,000 an acre land?\"[209]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn editorial in the _Fairfax Herald_ for September 6, 1935, reflects well\r\nthe changes seen on farms of the depression era.\r\n\r\n     Housewives throughout the county are becoming more and more\r\n     incensed over the steadily rising prices of foodstuffs,\r\n     particularly meats.... In many places housewives are actually\r\n     boycotting merchants who attempt to sell meat at the present price\r\n     level. The blame for the present rise in prices lies directly at\r\n     the door of the Raw Dealers and Brain Trusters. These smart young\r\n     gentlemen had a theory and in pursuance of that theory they\r\n     slaughtered a great number of hogs, in order to keep prices at an\r\n     unnaturally high level. They succeeded only too well.[210]\r\n\r\nThat the farm family was no longer raising its own meat, that they had\r\nlost a good deal of control over the quality and availability of their\r\ndaily necessities, that housewives viewed themselves as important and\r\ncohesive enough to organize a boycott, that farm commodities were no\r\nlonger strictly under the regulation of the farmer, and that the\r\ngovernment's interference was beginning to be questioned and resented\r\nwere signs of radical change in rural economic and social structure. The\r\nfarmer was no longer so isolated, nor so overtaxed with sheer physical\r\nlabor. The price he paid for these advantages was diminishing control\r\nover a way of life which had begun to slip away.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III--NOTES\r\n\r\n_Professionalization and an Increased Standard of Living_\r\n\r\n\r\n[157] Thomas A.

For many years the nation had considered\r\nagriculture to be not just the fundamental, but the ideal way of life.\r\nIt was with a start, therefore, that people began to realize, soon after\r\nthe turn of the century, that rural population was in fact decreasing,\r\nand that farm life fell short of the rosy dream of pastoral independence\r\nso cherished by Americans. A survey of farm conditions undertaken during\r\nthe administration of President Theodore Roosevelt revealed that many\r\nrural areas lacked the most basic amenities offered in cities and that\r\nlow farm prices retarded the agriculturist's efforts to better his\r\ncondition. Farm conditions improved during the World War I years when\r\nthe cries of \"Feed the World\" expanded markets and expectations.\r\nInevitably, though, this increased agricultural production became a\r\nliability, for when the European and domestic markets shrunk at the\r\nclose of the war farm prices fell drastically. Many farmers, hoping to\r\noffset the low prices with higher yields, took advantage of the new\r\ntechnology to produce bumper crops; the result was an additional surplus\r\nand even lower prices. Throughout the 1920s, the farm situation remained\r\ncritical.[211]\r\n\r\nThe stock market crash of 1929 marked an extension and exacerbation of\r\nthe grim farm conditions rather than a sudden decline. It rocked the\r\nfarmer's market, of course, by further decreasing the amount of raw\r\nproducts being sold; unemployed workers bought less of everything, and\r\noften kept gardens themselves. More crucial than the crash of 1929 to\r\nthe farmer's well-being in northern Virginia were two severe droughts,\r\none in the late 1920s and the other in 1931. The latter was particularly\r\nharsh. Wheat planted in October did not come up until April, and one\r\nwoman recalled that the cherry trees failed to blossom until the late\r\nfall.[212] Thousands of tons of hay and grain feeds had to be brought in\r\nfrom other parts of the country to feed the livestock, at enormous cost\r\nto the farmers. The combination of these unfortunate elements meant more\r\nmortgaged farms and tighter belts for the county's farmers.[213]\r\n\r\nRelief came in the form of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) which\r\nwent into effect in the spring of 1933. One of the earliest of Franklin\r\nRoosevelt's New Deal policies, it offered a radically new approach to\r\nfarm recovery. Whereas earlier governmental policies had relied on\r\ntariffs or half-hearted attempts to buy up surpluses to protect farm\r\nprofits, the AAA promoted a scheme of \"artificial scarcity.\" This was\r\naccomplished by price supports and through elimination of\r\nprice-depressing surpluses by paying the growers to cut down their crop\r\nacreage. Payments were financed by taxing food processors, such as\r\nmillers, who in turn shifted the burden to the consumer.[214]\r\n\r\nMany of the AAA provisions were aimed at the large producers of the\r\nlower south and midwest, but they also had their effect in areas of\r\nsmaller farms such as Fairfax County. Few county citizens were in\r\nabsolute want during the Depression, in part because the effective work\r\nof the Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association insured steady\r\nmilk prices. Yet these and later policies were embraced as being the\r\nonly available hope for turning around the farm situation. \"They were\r\ndistressed enough so that they were willing to cooperate in a\r\nconsiderable degree with anything that would help them out.\"[215]\r\n\r\nImplementing the programs created some initial problems. A system of\r\nacreage allotment had to be devised for each farmer, and this involved\r\nsetting up an intricate bureaucracy which included a county committee\r\n(made up of three local farmers), new responsibilities for the county\r\nagent, and close association with representatives of the new federal\r\nprograms. Confusion existed about the allowances made in the act for\r\nhome consumption and the process by which allotments were decided. To\r\narrive at the allowances for wheat, for example, the farmer had to\r\ncomplete two forms, on which it was necessary to compute his average\r\nyield for a three-year period (1930-1932) then adjust it to relate to a\r\nfive-year nationwide average; this figure, reduced by 15 to 20 percent\r\nwas his allowed production. The ultimate decision was made by the\r\nmembers of the county committee who had been elected by the taxpayers.\r\n\"I've often wondered whether our judgment was accurate enough to really\r\nbe used, but it was used,\" commented Holden Harrison who sat on the\r\nboard.[216] The AAA county committee sought to be equitable in its\r\ndeterminations, but as in any process which tries to fit a series of\r\nrequirements to individual cases, the decisions sometimes seemed\r\narbitrary or unfair. Derr cited a case resulting from the Potato Act\r\n(which required a farmer to pay a penalty for yields exceeding his\r\nallotment) in which an older couple had \"had poor luck with their\r\npotatoes for the base years; [they] almost wept when they learned that\r\ntheir future lease would be only forty bushels and they would have to\r\npay a tax on what they sold over that amount.\"[217] Snags also occurred\r\nin the administration of the farm loan program, designed by the\r\ngovernment to aid farmers in the purchase of seed and fertilizer. Not\r\nonly were elaborate accounts of mortgage, store and personal debts,\r\nunpaid taxes and notes required (sometimes for a loan of $25.00), but\r\nrepayment of the loan was set for dates such as July 1, when the crops\r\nwere not yet harvested and ready cash was scarce. As a result, much of\r\nthe money designated for aid to Fairfax County was never applied\r\nfor.[218] To the farmer, accustomed to deciding for himself what and\r\nwhen he would plant, and unfamiliar with the niceties of bureaucratic\r\nfinagling, the government sometimes seemed more geared to interference\r\nthan assistance.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the programs affected Fairfax County less than other parts\r\nof northern Virginia. Statistics from the Virginia Department of\r\nAgriculture and the USDA show that only 71 wheat adjustment contracts\r\nwere taken out in Fairfax County in 1935, compared to 233 for Fauquier\r\nCounty and 351 for Loudoun County. As each of these neighboring counties\r\ncontained over 2,000 farms, these are small figures indeed.[219]\r\n\r\nThe federal government set few limits on milk or poultry production, the\r\ncounty's two main economic sources, so the benefits of the AAA programs\r\nwere often indirect. The principal effect was to force farmers to set\r\naside about 15% of their land from wheat or corn production. Because\r\nFairfax County farmers marketed little of their grain production, the\r\noutcome was that they received a bounty for planting another crop on\r\nthis acreage, or allowing it to lie fallow and be fertilized. The policy\r\nresulted in a strong soil improvement program in the county, which was\r\nadditionally aided by the cooperative buying power of the county\r\ncommittee. This meant, for instance, that purchases of lime needed to\r\nimprove Fairfax County's acidic soil could be had for $3.50 a ton, the\r\ncost at the quarry, plus handling charges.[220]\r\n\r\nOf even greater benefit to Fairfax County farmers was the moratorium on\r\nmortgage and even interest payments during the Depression's most severe\r\nperiod. Individual banks, such as the National Bank of Leesburg, which\r\nheld many farm mortgages, also voluntarily followed the government's\r\npolicy of leniency on collection of farm debts. This relieved much of\r\nthe stress on the area's producers, allowing them to retain their land\r\nand, in some cases, even improve their holdings.[221]\r\n\r\nThe Depression years saw the advent of a radical new policy of\r\ngovernment influence in farm affairs. Where laissez-faire had been the\r\nfederal rule (and the farmers' desire), a control was now exercised over\r\nproduction, marketing and farm improvement. Though the farmer might\r\nbelieve this mitigated his independence and tied his judgment to that of\r\nan impersonal bureaucracy, he was forced to accept Uncle Sam's\r\ninterference. The role of the government in designing agricultural\r\npolicy proved to be a lasting one, still felt by the farmer of the\r\n1970s.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV--NOTES\r\n\r\n_The New Deal_\r\n\r\n[211] Barger and Lansburg, _American Agriculture, 1899-1949_, 72-112.\r\n\r\n[212] Beard/Harrison/Pryor, March 6, 1979; Rogers/Corbat, et al., June\r\n12, 1970.\r\n\r\n[213] Beard/Harrison/Pryor, March 6, 1979.\r\n\r\n[214] Bailey, _The American Pageant_, 842-43.\r\n\r\n[215] Rogers, Corbat, et al., June 12, 1970; Ellmore/Middleton/Pryor,\r\nMarch 8, 1979; Joseph Beard quoted in Beard/Harrison/Pryor, March 6,\r\n1979.\r\n\r\n[216] \"Wheat Production Control Plan,\" _Herndon News-Observer_, July 27,\r\n1933; \"Wheat Allotment Based on Averages,\" _Ibid._, August 17, 1933;\r\nBeard/Harrison/Pryor, March 6, 1979.\r\n\r\n[217] Derr Report, 1936, 4.

However, its effect was still to create some hostility to\r\ngovernment programs among farmers.\r\n\r\n[218] Derr Reports, 1930, 1931, 1934.\r\n\r\n[219] _Virginia Farm Statistics_ (Richmond, 1926, 1930, 1936).\r\n\r\n[220] Beard/Harrison/Pryor, March 6, 1979.\r\n\r\n[221] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\n_Community_\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the family, with its special working relationship, the\r\nneighborhood community was the chief social unit for the farmer. It made\r\navailable services the family could not provide for itself and added\r\nsociability and security to the farmer's life. It also had some\r\ninfluence on the tenor of his work because a dynamic community spirit\r\nprompts individual enterprise. The Floris neighborhood on which this\r\nstudy is focused was such a vigorous community. Fairfax County was\r\nfilled with similar crossroads which gave an identity to each farming\r\narea and, with post office, blacksmith and general store, fulfilled the\r\nfarmer's simple requirements. Floris seems to have shown an\r\noutstandingly progressive impulse, however, and a social interaction\r\nwhich made it an area of particular cohesiveness and community\r\nlongevity.[222]\r\n\r\nThe root of community interaction is neighborliness--an interest in and\r\nconcern for other people. Villages contain the same variety of human\r\nrelations and personality as large cities, with the advantage that the\r\nsmaller number of people are more easily known and understood. There\r\ncould be irritating aspects to this (privacy was not always available in\r\nabundance) but also a warm familiarity. The people of Floris were so\r\nwell acquainted that each man's favorite kind of pie was community\r\nknowledge.[223] Lottie Schneider, who grew up near Herndon, gave a\r\ncharming description of village life in her book, _Memoirs of Herndon,\r\nVirginia_:\r\n\r\n     Everyone was interested in his neighbor. We shared our joys and\r\n     sorrows, were sympathetic to each other. When we went down the\r\n     street we knew everybody and would stop to greet each other. There\r\n     was a village atmosphere of friendliness and kindness. How often I\r\n     pause over every memory and savor again the charm of the friendly\r\n     neighbors, the school and church relationships, the simple everyday\r\n     happenings which like a weaver's shuttle steadily wove the lights\r\n     and shadows into the tapestry of life.[224]\r\n\r\nNeighborliness went beyond social interaction; it was also the basis for\r\nmutual aid and cooperation. Work on hauling projects, barn raisings and\r\nemergency assistance was readily available. \"If somebody got sick and\r\ncouldn't milk his cows, why the neighbors would go over and help him,\"\r\nrelated Joseph Beard.\r\n\r\n     I remember the neighbor next door to me had the flu, and everybody\r\n     thought he was going to die and the snow was about twenty inches\r\n     deep.... There was a wife left there with three ... small children,\r\n     not of school age. My father not only did our work, but he went\r\n     over and did their work too.[225]\r\n\r\nMutual assistance, concern and hospitality were the bedrock of community\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A map of the Floris community, c. 1930, drawn from memory\r\nby Joseph Beard.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRapid communications made information on everyone's activities\r\nneighborhood knowledge. County agent Derr noted that it was \"remarkable\r\nhow rapidly news travels, whether good or bad,\" and that this was in\r\nfact an asset to his work.[226] The postal agent and telephone operator\r\nwere two other information catalysts. The postmaster, Thomas Walker, was\r\nnotorious for reading the postcards which passed his way, and often\r\ncalled the recipients to inform them of impending visits by relatives,\r\nor tidings of birth or death.[227] Telephone lines were put up in 1916,\r\n\"strung on trees, just old poles up and down the road\"[228] and this\r\ngreatly speeded channels of gossip and necessary information. The\r\ntelephone operator worked from her own bedroom and was the source for\r\nall the latest news. \"If you didn't know what was going on in the\r\nneighborhood, all you had to do was ask the telephone operator,\" one\r\nFloris resident observed. \"She knew everything.\"[229] In a more\r\npragmatic sense the operator was depended upon for help during\r\nemergencies. The fear of isolation, a chief liability of rural areas,\r\nwas much reduced by the improved roads and telecommunications of the\r\nfirst decade of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nThe telephone operator was particularly helpful in locating rural\r\ndoctors when they were needed in an emergency. Like the veterinarians,\r\ndoctors were not relied on for minor illnesses but were called on in\r\nextreme cases. Jack Day and William Robey were among the doctors who\r\ntravelled by horse and buggy (and later in early model Fords) to make\r\nhousecalls. They were loved and accepted by the community: \"We thought\r\nof a family doctor about like we did our minister.\"[230] Fees were\r\nusually $1.00 for a housecall though farmers would sometimes offer a\r\nbushel of corn or a chicken in payment for their treatment.[231]\r\n\r\nThe doctors contributed a great deal to the well-being of the community.\r\nRural families, however, were resourceful in finding home remedies for\r\nmany ailments. Some of these were long-respected herbal preparations,\r\nbut others were used more because of tradition than effectiveness.\r\nFrances Simpson described the special folk medicines of her family near\r\nHerndon:\r\n\r\n     When an epidemic was reported in the village during the winter, she\r\n     prepared the dreadful smelling _asafetida_ bags which she tied about\r\n     our necks under our dresses. They were supposed to ward off\r\n     diseases.\r\n\r\n     When my sisters and I had colds, mutton _tallow plasters_ were put\r\n     on our chests and fastened to our underwear. These sticky, clammy\r\n     plasters were worn until all signs of cold had disappeared.\r\n\r\n     _Sulpher and molasses_ by the spoonful were given in the spring 'to\r\n     help clear out our systems....' Calomel was an often used remedy\r\n     for the liver until the doctor forbade its use.\r\n\r\n     My mother had a bad case of erysipelas and her leg was in a fearful\r\n     state. Nothing seemed to help it. One night she dreamed my sister\r\n     Dora, who had recently died, came to her, told her to make\r\n     _poultices of cabbage leaves_ wrung in hot water and apply them to\r\n     her leg. She followed instructions and in due season her leg was\r\n     healed.[232]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G. Ray Harrison, c. 1925.

Photo courtesy of Ray Harrison.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Floris community was an early outgrowth of a mining settlement near\r\nFrying Pan Run. Robert Carter, of Nomini Hall in Westmoreland County,\r\nowned the land which he believed contained rich copper ore. Though roads\r\nwere built and several mining attempts made, the mineral proved to be of\r\npoor quality. The access offered by roads built by the miners (for\r\nexample, West Ox Road on which Frying Pan Farm is located) opened the\r\narea to agriculture. The first permanent community was formed by a group\r\nof Baptists, who successfully petitioned Carter for permission to build\r\na church on his property. One of their early churches, a simple, frame\r\nstructure built in 1791, still stands near the center of the\r\ncommunity.[233]\r\n\r\nThe origins of the area's unusual name are obscure--some believe either\r\nIndians or early miners who camped in the vicinity mislaid a frying pan\r\nand named the creek after their loss. Others feel that the circular\r\nshape of a round pool into which the run flows influenced its\r\nappellation. Until 1879 the community at the crossroads of the West Ox\r\nand Centreville Roads was also called Frying Pan, at which time it was\r\nthought too undignified a name. It was rechristened Floris, according to\r\none source, after the prettiest girl in the neighborhood. Another story\r\nrelates that summer boarders near Frying Pan Post Office thought such a\r\nlowly name would cause ridicule among their city friends. They called\r\nthe town Floris, which means \"flower\" in Latin, to tone up the image of\r\ntheir warm weather \"resort.\" By the time of the name change, the village\r\nhad expanded somewhat from an 1801 description of \"four log huts and a\r\nMeeting House,\"[234] but it retained its small personal character. In\r\nthe 1920s and 1930s it consisted of a blacksmith shop, general store and\r\npost office, a boarding house, three churches and two schools, as well\r\nas the surrounding farms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe focal point of the Floris community during this period, and the\r\nfactor which gave it a countywide importance, was the Floris Vocational\r\nHigh School. The school was the result of the Smith-Hughes Act, passed\r\nin 1917 to organize agriculture and home economics courses on the\r\nsecondary level of education. H. B. Derr tried unsuccessfully for two\r\nyears to establish such a course in Fairfax County but met with little\r\nsupport from the members of the school board, who favored traditional\r\nacademics. It was finally through the farmer's clubs and community\r\nleagues (forerunners of the PTA), especially those in the Floris area,\r\nthat Derr was able to convince the county of the program's potential. By\r\n1919 farmers and merchants had donated some $17,000 to start\r\nconstruction of a building, and in honor of the special efforts of\r\nagriculturalists in Floris, it was decided to locate the school\r\nthere.[235]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A sketch of the plot of land originally deeded to the\r\nschool board in 1876 by George Kenfield for a Floris school.

Note the tennis game being played in the front of the old\r\nbuilding. Copy of photo in Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Floris Vocational High School was the third to be built in\r\nVirginia.[236] It was extended from an existing, two-year high school,\r\nfounded in 1911, but the property on which it was built had actually\r\nbeen deeded to the school board over forty years earlier. In 1876 George\r\nKenfield deeded about six acres of land to the Frying Pan School\r\nAssociation and the property remained in school use through several\r\nowner changes.[237] One- and two-room schools stood on the land until\r\n1911 when a larger building was completed.[238]\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Floris had worked together to raise money for the\r\nvocational school; they also contributed their skills and time to its\r\nconstruction. Under the direction of two (often dissenting) contractors,\r\na Mr. Sheffield and Jack Walker, pupils and parents helped to raise the\r\nthree-story brick structure, and later to build a smaller agricultural\r\nshop a short distance from the main schoolhouse. The school was open to\r\nthe entire county but the immediate community continued to feel a\r\nspecial interest in it. The Floris Home Demonstration Club served hot\r\nlunches in the school for many years and around 1924 they sponsored the\r\nhiring of a music teacher at their own expense until the county and\r\nstate finally gave support to the teacher.[239]\r\n\r\nFloris Vocational High School was an immediate success. In 1924 it had\r\n150 pupils, evenly divided between primary and secondary grades, and\r\nhailing chiefly from the Herndon area. Students walked or rode horseback\r\nto reach their classes; some, such as Virginia Presgraves Harrison from\r\nLoudoun County, boarded with local families.[240] The high school\r\noffered the standard curriculum courses of English, American and\r\nEuropean history, algebra, geography, physics and chemistry. Courses in\r\nhigher mathematics (plane geometry and trigonometry) were optional as\r\nwere English history and foreign languages. The school differed from the\r\ncounty's other secondary institutions in the varied agriculturally\r\noriented courses it taught. Boys learned the principles of agronomy,\r\nanimal husbandry, soil control and veterinary science, and were expected\r\nto put the theoretical knowledge into practice with test animals and\r\nacreage on their home farms. They also sharpened their skills in\r\nagricultural shop courses. Under the guidance of Ford Lucas and, later,\r\nHarvey D. Seale, they were taught carpentry, motor repair,\r\nblacksmithing, indeed, everything from building chicken coops to \"how to\r\nput a roof on a barn and keep it from leaking.\"[241] Classes for the\r\ngirls also stressed the relationship between theory and practice. The\r\nrudiments of nutrition, food preparation, fabric and clothing\r\nconstruction, were carried over into \"Hominy Hall,\" a house owned by\r\nWilliam Ellmore, which housed the kitchen and serving areas for domestic\r\nscience courses. The girls spent several hours a week in this building,\r\ngaining proficiency in the work which would probably occupy most of\r\ntheir lives. Like the majority of the students' homes, Hominy Hall had\r\nno running water, and baking was done on a large, wood-burning\r\nstove.[242] The classes were taught by, among others, May Calhoun and\r\nLouisa Glassal. Elizabeth Ellmore, principal of Floris Vocational High\r\nSchool in 1929-1930, noted that because of the school's personal nature\r\nthe teachers had a fair amount of leeway in the character and depth of\r\nthe courses they taught--as much, in fact, as their students would allow\r\nthem.[243] One early teacher found the pupils very apt indeed, with\r\nabilities equal to those of the town children she had previously taught.\r\nStated Lulah Ferguson:\r\n\r\n     So far as the interest was concerned you'd find that maybe those\r\n     children in Falls Church were a little more interested in affairs\r\n     in general, a little better informed generally, than these were,\r\n     but so far as their attitude towards studying or wanting to know,\r\n     you wouldn't find any difference. These country children were\r\n     really just as eager or maybe more so than some of the small\r\n     town....[244]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The championship girl's basketball team of Floris\r\nVocational High School, 1924-1925.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The \"Floris Follies,\" a minstrel presented at the Floris\r\nschool in March, 1939.

Richard Peck recalled playing several pranks during school\r\nhours, such as catching copperhead snakes and letting them loose in the\r\nclassroom, or mixing together soil samples painstakingly collected for\r\nCounty agent Derr. Much to the mischievous students' hilarity, a puzzled\r\nDerr remarked, \"I had no idea the soil was so uniform out here.\"[245]\r\nThough afternoon farmwork occupied most of the pupils' spare time, some\r\nextra-curricular activities were also offered. Plays were given annually\r\nby the senior class, an example being the 1925 production of \"Home\r\nTimes\" billed as \"very attractive\" by the _Herndon News-Observer_.[246]\r\nThe Floris Vocational High School also boasted highly competitive\r\nathletic teams, especially in basketball and track. For a school of its\r\nsize, it showed unusual competence and enthusiasm, winning both boys'\r\nand girls' county basketball championships several years running. In\r\n1928 their track team competed with 800 high schools in the state,\r\nfinishing fifth overall and claiming two of the seven records which were\r\nbroken.[247] In this, as in the academic standing of the vocational\r\nschool, the community's dynamism and interest influenced its high degree\r\nof excellence.\r\n\r\nGraduation exercises were also community events. The students worked for\r\nweeks planning a memorable evening for proud parents, friends and\r\nrelations. The 1927 graduation from Floris Vocational High School\r\nfeatured an invocation by Reverend Glenn Cooper of the Floris\r\nMethodist Church, valedictory and salutatory addresses given by Virginia\r\nPresgraves and Joseph Beard, respectively, and a talk on the promising\r\nfuture for farmers by Professor Walter Newman of VPI which the local\r\npaper described as \"worthy of the attention of any farming community in\r\nour state.\" These formalities were followed by musical selections,\r\nincluding a duet by Gilbert Presgraves and Joseph Beard, who sang the\r\nschool song, \"Our Old High.\" Next came the presentation of diplomas \"in\r\na most pleasing fashion.\" Wrote the _Herndon News-Observer_: \"Each student\r\nwas complimented on his success while his classmates were roused to\r\ngreat hilarity by some well-directed humor.\"[248]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A maypole dance held at the Floris Elementary School in\r\n1923. Celebrations of this sort were held each May 1. Miss Katie Grok is\r\nthe teacher on the right. Photo courtesy of Margaret Mary Lee.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A 1910 photograph of the Floris Elementary School, built\r\nin 1900. The building was replaced by a two-year high school the next\r\nyear. Copy of photo in Virginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFloris Vocational High School graduated its last class in 1930. The\r\nprevious year the school board had voted to consolidate the county's\r\nschools. The school consolidation movement was aimed principally at\r\nsmall one and two-room schoolhouses; by combining these local\r\ninstitutions, better facilities could be afforded and, consequently,\r\nteachers of high caliber attracted. The county's farm families had\r\nclamoured for just such a reorganization for many years, but the measure\r\nwas contingent on the availability of good roads because rural children\r\nwould have to travel some distance to the new district schools. The\r\npurpose of the judgment as passed did not really pertain to the Floris\r\nSchool, yet it came under the school-board's jurisdiction and\r\nconsequently the Floris High School pupils were moved with those of\r\nForestville to join Herndon High School.[249]\r\n\r\nAgriculture courses were also offered at Herndon High School, for\r\nexample, in 1933, 43 boys were enrolled in farm-oriented programs. Yet,\r\nthe closing of the Vocational High School was a decisive loss for\r\nFloris. The school had been built and maintained by local money and\r\nlabor and was thus a strong focal point in the neighborhood. It had\r\nencouraged community self-esteem and the area's pride had been reflected\r\nin the strong academic programs the school produced. The district high\r\nschools were less personal in nature and broader in scope; they did not\r\nso accurately fulfill an individual locale's needs. An illustration of\r\nthis was the rigid adherence to school attendance regulations at Herndon\r\nHigh School. Whereas a neighborhood school would often allow a farm boy\r\nor girl to be excused from classes during peak work periods of\r\nharvesting or butchering, the new consolidated schools were less\r\nflexible. In one case a student who persisted in helping his family was\r\ncontinually kept behind and never did graduate. Like other \"progressive\"\r\nmovements, consolidation of rural schools advanced the quality of life\r\nin only some areas. It made available more modern equipment and a wider\r\nrange of teachers and curriculum, but in social relations and community\r\nbenefit, the advantages were not so clearcut.[250]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Home Economics and Future Farmer's Club of Floris\r\nVocational High School in the mid-1920s. Photo courtesy of Emma\r\nEllmore.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other main institutions which gave character and definition to the\r\nFloris community were the churches. There were three places of worship\r\nthere in the 1920s and 1930s, all of them protestant. The old Frying Pan\r\nBaptist Church had been a continuous congregation since the\r\nmid-eighteenth century. They were the least social and most dogmatic in\r\ntheir religious practice; members of the other churches used adjectives\r\nsuch as \"old school\" or \"hard-shell\" to describe the Baptists. After the\r\nturn of the century and during the Depression, the Baptist Church was\r\nless regenerative than the others in Floris and most of the members were\r\nolder people.[251]\r\n\r\nLess doctrinaire, the Floris Methodist Church and Floris Presbyterian\r\nChurch, were a more active part of the community. The church buildings,\r\nwith their large seating capacity, made natural auditoriums for farmers'\r\nmeetings, lectures and entertainments. The two churches cooperated in\r\nsponsorship of an Epworth Youth League, which, though it held its Sunday\r\nnight meetings in the more centrally located Methodist Church, was\r\nnon-denominational in character. The Reverend Glenn Cooper reported in\r\n1927 that \"the Floris League, being an independent and a community\r\norganization does not take up any denominational work, but is interested\r\nin local charities and its own entertainment.\"[252] The Presbyterian and\r\nMethodist churches also worked together in planning holiday programs and\r\navoided conflicts by considerately scheduling their important festivals\r\non different dates. At Christmastime, they were especially careful to\r\nplan their carol programs so that the entire community could attend both\r\nservices. As there was a great deal of intermarriage between the two\r\nchurches, this also reduced family strife.[253] Both groups welcomed\r\nmembers of other faiths. One Presbyterian recalled an occasion when his\r\nfather greeted a new family just moving into the neighborhood and\r\ninvited them to attend the local services. \"This man said, 'Well, you\r\nknow I'm a Roman Catholic.' My Dad said, 'It doesn't make any difference\r\nwhat you are, we'd sure like to have you come if you can.' This was the\r\ngeneral attitude.\"[254] Indeed, so ecumenical had the organizations\r\nbecome that the General Conference of the Methodist Church became\r\nsomewhat alarmed. As early as 1905 this body noted that although its\r\nmembers were leading quiet, orderly lives and attended church services\r\nfrequently, still the congregation was \"not satisfactory in some very\r\nessential respects.\" \"Our people have been in the past and are now very\r\nnegligent and indifferent as to the duty of informing themselves about\r\nour doctrines and church policy,\" stated the minutes of the church's\r\nquarterly conference. \"There must be a more general study of the church\r\ndiscipline and a larger circulation and a close and careful reading of\r\nour church papers.\"[255]\r\n\r\nThe churches were rarely used for political purposes. Instead, the\r\nfarmers relied on their farmer's clubs to exert this kind of pressure\r\nand seemed to feel that the religious bodies should concentrate on\r\npaving the spiritual road to heaven rather than the connecting road to\r\nthe market. In addition to the regular activities of Sunday school,\r\nBible classes and regular worship services, however, these institutions\r\nfulfilled a strong need for fellowship and social interaction.\r\n\r\nSunday school picnics and ice cream socials were perennial favorites\r\nsponsored each summer by the churches. The picnics were frequently held\r\non attractive parts of neighboring farms, or sometimes as far away as\r\nSeneca or Great Falls. Each family would bring a large hamper of food,\r\nbut the fried chicken, watermelon and pies were spread out on the tables\r\nto be shared by everyone. While the parents gossiped or talked politics,\r\nthe children played and sometimes went swimming. These picnics, like\r\nother community events, were held jointly by the Methodists and\r\nPresbyterians.[256] The ice cream socials, however, were another story.\r\nHere a mild rivalry set in as ladies vied with one another to produce\r\nthe most admirable cake, and even a slight competition arose over the\r\nice cream. An area resident confided that there was some speculation\r\nabout which denomination's members owned cows giving the creamiest milk,\r\nthus producing the \"most sinfully rich\" ice cream.[257] No doubt this\r\ncomparison diminished in importance when one was faced with the wide\r\nvariety of homemade flavors, using fresh fruits and extracts. Sometimes\r\nin early summer the socials would feature strawberries along with the\r\nice cream. On a quiet summer evening, with the fireflies flickering like\r\nbeacon lights and a whispering breeze lapping at tableclothes and\r\nskirts, these must have been particularly pleasant events.[258]\r\n\r\nSignificant holidays also brought about special church programs. At\r\nEaster the churches were banked with flowers and a singular rejoicing\r\noccurred, and on Mother's Day an appropriate program was offered. The\r\n1926 service included a suitable sermon and original Mother's Prayer by\r\nthe minister and several selections by the choir, among them \"When\r\nMother Sang to Me,\" \"Don't Forget the Old Folks,\" and \"Our Mother.\"[259]\r\nThe year's main celebration was, of course, at Christmas. Each church\r\nhad a Christmas tree, cut by an adult, but decorated with \"feet and\r\nalmost miles\" of popcorn strings by the neighborhood's young people,\r\nincluding those just returning home for the holidays. The warm ambiance\r\nof these services is evident in the following description, recounted by\r\nJoseph Beard:\r\n\r\n     They always had the little people from what you consider the\r\n     primary grades on up to sixth or seventh grade recite some little\r\n     poem or some story or something of this kind. You nearly always had\r\n     a chorus or choir, small, of people in the neighborhood that would\r\n     sing Christmas carols. You always had a minister who read or\r\n     recited the Christmas story from the Bible.... The churches were\r\n     lighted with oil lamps, and they would put candles on the Christmas\r\n     tree, wax candles and they would light those wax candles and then\r\n     blow out the lights. It's a wonder we never set the church on\r\n     fire.... But there would be this beautiful tree with all these\r\n     lights on it, and hidden down under the tree somewhere would be a\r\n     great big crate of oranges. Santa Claus usually came in and ... he\r\n     would ring sleigh bells and walk down through the aisle and make\r\n     some kind of remark. He would have a sack on his back. This always\r\n     held tiny little sacks of candy. They started with the smallest\r\n     children and gave each one of them one orange and one sack of hard\r\n     candy. They went on up the line as far as the oranges and the candy\r\n     lasted. If you didn't have a crowd even the adults would get a sack\r\n     of candy and an orange, but if you had a large crowd, why it\r\n     stopped at whatever age it ran out along the line. This was an\r\n     affair at which the program would probably take an hour, an hour\r\n     and fifteen minutes. But it was cold in there you know ... they'd\r\n     have a great big, old pot bellied stove, but it was in one place in\r\n     the church. Everybody couldn't sit around that stove, so you sat\r\n     there in your overcoats sometimes.[260]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Miss Gladys Thompson and the Floris Community Orchestra,\r\n1929.

It consisted of her violin\r\npupils and other musically inclined citizens and was called the Floris\r\nCommunity Orchestra. Twelve violins, and mandolins, saxophones, piano,\r\ndrums and banjo made up the group which played for school plays and\r\ncommunity events. They also put on an annual recital and one year even\r\ngave a vaudeville show. \"I remember she used to fill up her small\r\none-seated roadster with music students going to practices and\r\nperformances,\" fondly wrote a member of the orchestra, Louise McNair\r\nRyder. \"One of my greatest pleasures was clambering into the rumble seat\r\nwith my violin.\"[261]\r\n\r\nMusical groups also sprang up spontaneously. One, which Joseph Beard\r\nreferred to as a \"little old hillybilly band,\" included besides himself\r\non fiddle, Virginia Presgraves (piano) and her uncle Austin Wagstaff on\r\nukulele. Richard Peck played banjo and saxophone for the group. They\r\nplayed together over a period of several years, using no sheet music,\r\nbut becoming so comfortable with each other's playing that they could\r\nanticipate the variations and style of their fellow musicians. They\r\npracticed in the schoolhouse, playing country tunes such as \"Camp Town\r\nRaces,\" \"Old Black Joe,\" and \"Shortnin' Bread\" for their own amusement.\r\nThey rarely entertained an audience.[262] Sometimes too the school or an\r\nunofficial group sponsored musical events, a notable one being the\r\nconcert by \"Al Hopkins and his Buckle-Busters,\" a celebrated country\r\nband from North Carolina.[263]\r\n\r\nIn addition, serious organizations like the Farmer's Clubs, Community\r\nLeague or church-affiliated women's clubs, mixed work and play by\r\nsponsoring picnics, quilting bees, and oyster suppers. The record made\r\nof a pleasant outing by Farmer's Clubs #1 and #4 to the Great Falls in\r\n1913 was typical of many excursions in later years:\r\n\r\n     It goes without saying that all present had a very enjoyable day.\r\n     The children spent much time on the swings and Merry-Go-Rounds\r\n     while the older members spent the day in viewing the falls....\r\n     While still others enjoyed fishing.[264]\r\n\r\nHome Demonstration Clubs also put on their share of entertainments, with\r\nbuffet suppers and skits, rounding off one year with a \"husband-calling\r\ncontest.\"[265] Even the business meetings themselves were social\r\noccasions at which dinner and friendly conversation were mixed with more\r\ncritical concerns.\r\n\r\nOyster suppers were a regional specialty held all over the county, of\r\nwhich Floris sponsored its share. They were often money-making events\r\n(as were the ice cream socials) at which dinner cost from twenty-five to\r\nfifty cents and featured stewed and fried oysters. Lottie Schneider\r\nrecalled the bustle of preparation for an oyster supper given in\r\nHerndon, involving the setting up of tables and benches and flower\r\narrangements, and the difficult choice to be made between fried or\r\nstewed oysters and the many different relishes brought by each\r\nlady.[266] The suppers in fact generally held an overabundance of food.\r\nAgain, Joseph Beard described the scene:\r\n\r\n     There were always a few who didn't like oysters and they always had\r\n     ham for those.... Anything that you would have in a farming\r\n     neighborhood like that, when you sat down to eat it was just like\r\n     having a Thanksgiving dinner. Everything from sweet potatoes to\r\n     scalloped potatoes to macaroni and cheese to string beans to\r\n     corn-on-the-cob to tomatoes [would be served]. Most anything that\r\n     could be raised or produced in a vegetable garden or in a truck\r\n     patch they'd bring. Then we had custard pies and lemon pies and\r\n     apple pies....[267]\r\n\r\nThe money made at the oyster dinners was used for school projects, to\r\nbuy church furnishings or aid in mission work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessional interest and pleasure were likewise combined at the various\r\nfairs held in the area during the late summer. The county sponsored a\r\nfair at Fairfax Courthouse until 1933 which featured new farm machinery,\r\nexemplary produce and livestock, and a gay carnival atmosphere. The\r\n_Herndon News-Observer_ gave a colorful account of the county festivities\r\nin its September 23, 1926 edition:\r\n\r\n     The first day was largely devoted to judging, the second day saw a\r\n     large picnic by Dranesville farmers, the County Chamber of Commerce\r\n     and the 4-H Clubs frolicked on the third day while the visible and\r\n     invisible empire [of the Ku Klux Klan] held sway on the last day.\r\n     Good racing cards filled much of the afternoon. The prizes were\r\n     more substantial and the performances proportionally good. Every\r\n     exhibit building was loaded with all varieties and grades of\r\n     exhibits, while the livestock was as equally interesting in its\r\n     magnitude and diversification.\r\n\r\n     The flower department was carried partly out of the building where\r\n     loving hands [had] specially devoted time and energy toward\r\n     perfection. The woman's department, with nearly a thousand entries,\r\n     was a wonder of culinary art. The poultry building with every\r\n     squeek and squawk imaginable, fairly dazzled the farmers and their\r\n     friends, who came to see what Fairfaxians and their friends are\r\n     doing. Certainly no other fair in Virginia presented an arena of\r\n     keener competition and the prize winners deserve to be most highly\r\n     congratulated....[268]\r\n\r\n     The midway was a swirl of ferris wheels, merry-go-rounds and every\r\n     variety of game by which you might separate yourself from surplus\r\n     funds.\r\n\r\nThe region boasted a similar fair held generally in Prince William\r\nCounty and having the dual purpose of promoting and celebrating the\r\ndairy industry. The Piedmont Dairy Festival, as it was called, was\r\nmodeled after the famous Shenandoah Apple Blossom festival and was\r\njocularly known locally as the \"Cow Blossom festival.\"[269]\r\n\r\nFloris itself held a substantial fair in the years following the\r\ndecision to stop running a county exhibition. It grew out of the yearly\r\n\"Flower and Vegetable Show\" which had been sponsored by the 4-H and Home\r\nDemonstration Clubs and took place on the school grounds. The community\r\ndivided itself into committees which met year-round to plan the produce\r\nand homemaking judgings, livestock shows and entertainment and the\r\nresult was an event of countywide interest. A program from the 1939 fair\r\nlists among the categories \"three summer squash,\" \"best adult clothing,\"\r\n\"best buttonhole,\" and \"best Holstein heifer.\" Prizes consisted of cash\r\n(usually one to two dollars) or practical items such as five gallons of\r\nfly spray. Ironically the award for the best team of draft horses was\r\nthree gallons of oil.[270]\r\n\r\nA good deal of pride in everyday achievements resulted from the\r\ncontests. Elizabeth Rice, writing of the excitement caused by the fairs,\r\nrecalled the year she entered a devil's food cake in the county\r\nexhibition and \"received the blue ribbon and a prize from Swann's Down\r\nCompany of a cake mold, measuring cups, spoons and a box of Swann's\r\nDown cake flour.\" \"I still feel 'up' over it,\" she concluded.[271]\r\nOthers took their entries a little less seriously. Emma Ellmore\r\nremembered the year her mother simply cut a tangled mass of clematis\r\nfrom the back trellis, stuck it in a white vase and entered it in the\r\nflower-arranging contest, to win a blue ribbon from judges who admired\r\nits exceptional artistry.[272] The day was concluded with a\r\n\"tournament,\" in which the neighborhood's young manhood vied with one\r\nanother for the honor of crowning their lady queen. Lance in hand, \"Sir\r\nLancelot\" or \"Sir Frying Pan\" rode at a gallop on a \"steed\" (often a\r\ndraft horse) attempting to spear a ring suspended above the track. The\r\nwinner reigned at the square dance that evening which capped the day's\r\nentertainment.[273]\r\n\r\nBlue ribbons and fair championships were respected and admired by the\r\nneighbors and gave the recipient a certain amount of status. In a\r\ncommunity in which no one had much ready money, this evidence of\r\nleadership or skill counted for a great deal. One person suggested that\r\na large family gave a farmer a certain standing among his peers, and\r\nthat homemaking was equally respected with the outdoor work. A clever\r\nmanager was perhaps most admired of all. As Joseph Beard remarked:\r\n\"There are some people who have very little money, but have the ability\r\nto use it in the right place at the right time and get a great deal more\r\nout of it than others. I suspect that the person that had the highest\r\nstandard of living with what they had to do with was respected more than\r\nany one thing.\"[274]\r\n\r\nFarmers from the Floris area also held private entertainments, such as\r\nthe Peck family reunion of 1927, or the bridge parties which became so\r\nfashionable in the late 1920s and 1930s.[275] On rare occasions they\r\ntravelled to Washington to see a show or to shop. More often they went\r\nto Herndon which had long catered to the farmer's needs. Stores, grain\r\ncompanies and mills, blacksmith and livery stables built their business\r\non fulfilling the farmer's everyday requirements, while ice cream\r\nparlors and movie theaters provided pleasant distractions. The latter\r\nwas an especially popular form of entertainment for young couples on\r\ndates. Frances Simpson recalled the excitement of going to the movies\r\nand the unique personality of the Herndon theater:\r\n\r\n     What a fascination was that theater or 'movie hall' as it was\r\n     called.... It was a real treat to go with our friends to the movies\r\n     at the movie hall, not that we always saw one when we got there.\r\n     Sometimes the reel would break, other times a tremendous storm\r\n     would come up and the electric power would be shut off, leaving the\r\n     player piano to carry on alone in the darkness while we crept home\r\n     with flashlights, and more than once an angry skunk sought refuge\r\n     under the movie hall causing the audience to disperse in three\r\n     minutes flat. Still, it was great fun.[276]\r\n\r\nAll of these community events--ice cream socials, fairs, Community\r\nLeague meetings, and school events--were attended by the whole family.\r\nSocial activities were less strictly drawn along age lines than they are\r\ntoday; young and old enjoyed the same amusements. The ladies chatted\r\nwhile preparing the dinners at Farmer's Club meetings, and the children\r\ncame along and played together. Funerals and weddings were also family\r\nevents for children were expected to learn of life's joys and sorrows\r\nthrough participation. This too encouraged community cohesiveness, as\r\nall parts of the society were included in its rituals, and children\r\nlearned at an early age that they played an active role in the\r\nneighborhood's well-being; there was a place for them within the\r\ncommunity which would last the length of their life. Strong evidence of\r\nthis community identity is seen in the large numbers of Floris young\r\npeople who, even in the face of urban opportunities, elected to stay on\r\nthe family farm, or chose careers in the agriculture-related fields of\r\nveterinary medicine, extension work or fish and wildlife\r\nprotection.[277]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFloris and the other closely knit agricultural villages of Fairfax\r\nCounty were exceptionally unified and supportive. Yet even these\r\ncommunities had fringe groups, which were not entirely fulfilled within\r\nthe neighborhood or accepted by the majority of farmers. In some cases,\r\nthis was caused by under-stimulation and exasperation at the slow\r\npatterns of rural movement. \"We were bored to tears,\" wrote one Floris\r\nresident of the long Sunday afternoons spent discussing nothing but\r\npolitics.[278] More frequently an individual was ignored or shunned by\r\nthe society because of personal problems which had become a community\r\nnuisance: drinking, drugs or sexual indiscretions. The families of such\r\nsocial deviants were pitied and aided, but the offending individuals\r\nwere avoided--\"To whatever extent we could we would ostracize them.\" In\r\none extreme case the neighborhood took the law into its own hands and\r\nlynched a man suspected of rape. \"This man may have been innocent as you\r\nlook back on it now but they thought he did it and they got rid of him\r\nright then,\" related one local citizen. \"They just wouldn't put up with\r\nthat. It just wasn't tolerated, that's all.\"[279]\r\n\r\nThe largest group outside the community's mainstream was the black\r\nagricultural workers. Except in the realm of employer/employee relations\r\nthey had little social intercourse with their neighbors. Floris\r\nVocational High School was not open to Negro students and the schools\r\nthat were available to blacks were much inferior to those which taught\r\nwhite children. No high school existed at all for the blacks and the\r\none-to three-room schools that existed were \"in the most dilapidated\r\ncondition,\" with no water, heat or adequate toilet facilities.[280]\r\nEdith Rogers made a revealing comment about the quality of the teachers\r\nwhen she stated that she knew of one that had a degree.[281] In\r\nextension activities blacks were also often overlooked. The first black\r\n4-H club was organized in 1934 without the help of the county agent's\r\noffice, and it was only after two years of exceptional work that he\r\nbelatedly recognized its existence. \"The colored club at the Vienna\r\nSchool was organized, but we did not expect much from it,\" Derr reported\r\nin 1936.\r\n\r\n     A few days ago we were considerably surprised to have the Principal\r\n     of the School send in her report ... Nearly every colored boy and\r\n     girl nine years up to eighteen did some work ... Taking it in we\r\n     feel it is a credible showing for a colored school that has not\r\n     received its full share of assistance in club work.[282]\r\n\r\nBlack activities in churches and farmer's clubs were similarly ignored.\r\n\r\nSome black families appear to have been respected for their industry or\r\nfarming ability. The George Coates family near Floris was one. White\r\nneighbors exchanged work and admired the Coates progressive techniques,\r\nbut still \"never went so far as to sit down to dinner with them.\"[283]\r\nBlacks were excluded from the area's fairs, socials and concerts, except\r\nin rare cases when a rope kept the audience segregated.[284] Among\r\nthemselves they, of course, had their own entertainments, but in general\r\nthe broader opportunities and amusements of the county were closed to\r\nthe blacks.\r\n\r\nIn the inter-war period another group was increasingly on the fringe of\r\nthe established community. These were the urban migrants who came along\r\nthe new roads and railroad lines, seeking an escape from city stresses.\r\nThe earliest to arrive were summer residents, then came the part-time\r\nfarmers who wanted country air but city pay. Finally the unabashed\r\nsuburbanite who looked only for a quiet place to rest between bouts of\r\nurban employment moved in. Nearly all came seeking how they could\r\nbenefit by living in the country, not what they could contribute to it.\r\nAt first county residents welcomed this influx with open arms; they saw\r\nthe expansion as a boon to employment and markets. Only later did they\r\nbegin to realize that, in small ways and large, the forces of economic\r\nexpansion would alter the shape of their community.[285]\r\n\r\nThose who migrated chiefly in order to farm were welcomed by the county\r\nfarm families, but those who were unaccustomed to country ways caused\r\nsome problems for the rural folk. An editorial in the _Fairfax Herald_ for\r\nApril 23, 1926, bemoaned the loss of many of the county's lovely\r\nwildflowers, for the suburban residents frequently ignored trespass\r\nrules to pick the flowers.[286] Also alarming were the differing habits\r\nand manners of the city migrants and threat of an infiltration of\r\n\"unusual and often undesirable\" people. Hearing rumors that a nudist\r\ncolony was to be established in the county's Dranesville District, the\r\n_Herndon News-Observer_ declared stoutly\r\n\r\n     We have a lot of objectionable people in the county, who have\r\n     spilled over from Washington, but we will at least require that\r\n     they bring their 'duds' along before they can hope to experience a\r\n     cordial reception.[287]\r\n\r\nA more critical matter was the importation and propagation of insects\r\nfrom the city, such as the oriental fruit moth, which thrived in the\r\ncarelessly kept backyard plantings of suburbanites and then wreaked\r\nhavoc in commercial orchards. County agents Derr and Beard spent\r\nconsiderable time advising these newcomers and helping them plant their\r\ngardens.[288]\r\n\r\nAside from these minor alarms, the urban influx had really serious\r\nconsequences for the farmers of Fairfax County. As the numbers of\r\nnon-farm residents grew, political interest lines began to be drawn and\r\nin some cases the farmers began losing control over local governing\r\npolicies. This did not happen in all areas; for example, the County\r\nBoard of Supervisors consisted solely of farmers well into the 1940s.\r\nHowever, in some vicinities there were definite political repercussions\r\nfrom the suburban population, such as in Herndon, which although\r\ncommercially oriented, had always been sympathetic to the farmer's\r\nviews. In the years after the arrival of the electric trolley, city\r\nworkers and farmers battled at the polls over mayoral candidates and\r\ncouncil representatives; by the 1920s the town council was dominated by\r\nbusinessmen and professionals.[289]\r\n\r\nThis growing tendency towards political alienation for the farmer was\r\nforeshadowed in a letter of complaint written by the Farmer's Club #1 to\r\nthe Governor of Virginia in October, 1909:\r\n\r\n     The attention of the Fairfax Farmer's Club No. 1 has been called to\r\n     the fact that the delegates from this county to the Farmer's\r\n     National Congress are not farmers, one being Sheriff of the County,\r\n     the other a merchant--both reputable citizens but neither\r\n     interested directly in agriculture.[290]\r\n\r\nLike the other changes shaking the farmers' world, the loss of\r\ngovernment influence created a disturbing sense of impermanence and\r\nestrangement. This, coupled with the previously mentioned tax rise\r\n(which was exacerbated by the influx of people, all purchasing land and\r\ncreating a rise in prices due to demand) indicated to the farmer that he\r\nwas losing control over a world which had for generations remained\r\nsecure and settled. Ultimately, these forces crowded him out altogether,\r\nand simultaneously destroyed most of the pastoral communities to which\r\nthe suburbanites had hoped to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V--NOTES\r\n\r\n_Community_\r\n\r\n[222] For an extensive study of community relations, see Kolb and\r\nBrunner, _A Study of Rural Society_, 75-139.\r\n\r\n[223] Beard/Pryor, January 23, 1979.\r\n\r\n[224] Schneider, _Memoirs of Herndon, Virginia_, 35.\r\n\r\n[225] Beard/Pryor, January 23, 1979.\r\n\r\n[226] Derr Report, 1930, 16.\r\n\r\n[227] Ellmore/Netherton, March 2, 1978.\r\n\r\n[228] Beard/Pryor, January 23, 1979.\r\n\r\n[229] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[230] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[231] Andrew M.

The county's farmers had spent much of the inter-war\r\nperiod adjusting to the new agricultural modes, but they could not adapt\r\nto the burgeoning metropolitan area's desire for expansion. The\r\nconstruction of Dulles International Airport in the late 1950s further\r\ndepleted the county's agricultural areas, wiping out both the Willard\r\ncommunity and much of the farmland around Floris. Even those farmers who\r\nhad noticed the trends of twenty years felt a nagging sense of loss and\r\nresentment at the passing of their traditional way of life.[291]\r\n\r\nFrying Pan Park is an attempt to give citizens a glimpse of their\r\nheritage by recreating the familiar patterns of family farming. Its\r\nlocation (near the corner of West Ox and Centreville Roads) in the\r\nstill-quiet Floris center makes it ideal for interpretation of the more\r\ntranquil past. The park's purpose is primarily educational and\r\nhistorical, however it also offers recreational activities. These\r\ninclude equestrian facilities, bridle paths and nature walks, as well as\r\nthe model farm.\r\n\r\nThe idea for such a park began in 1957 when Joseph Beard, then the\r\ncounty agent, began proposing uses for the old Floris School property\r\nwhich was no longer needed by the county schoolboard. He advised the\r\nFairfax County government that the land and school buildings be\r\nestablished as a youth center. As such, it would be available to the\r\nFuture Farmers of America, the 4-H Club, scouting groups, and similar\r\norganizations to stage fairs, hold meetings and provide recreation.[292]\r\nThis proposal was accepted and in 1960 the land was deeded to the\r\nFairfax County Park Authority whose powers of police protection and\r\nmaintenance were superior to those of the individual young people's\r\norganizations. An independent citizen board was also established at this\r\ntime and the Park has been continually administered by the Park\r\nAuthority and Frying Pan Park Supervisory Board.[293] The latter\r\nconsists of representatives of agricultural, homemaking and youth\r\norganizations such as the Agricultural Extension Advisory Board, the\r\nFairfax County Granges and the Future Homemakers of America. Under their\r\ndirection, the 4-H not only began to clean the grounds, but staged a few\r\ntentative activities. The early success of the events, coupled with a\r\ngrowing interest in the park by equestrian groups, led the Fairfax\r\nCounty Park Authority to acquire bits and pieces of adjoining property\r\nthroughout the 1960s and 1970s, enlarging the original holding of 4.39\r\nacres to 87.6 acres. They also constructed several buildings for use in\r\nlivestock exhibitions and horse shows.[294] A model farm, strongly\r\nadvocated by the county agent, Grange and other farm-oriented groups was\r\nalso proposed in this first decade. A dearth of development money and\r\npopular pressure to expand the equestrian facilities combined to delay\r\nits inception.[295]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Master plan of Frying Pan Park showing ideal arrangement\r\nof the model farm, exhibition halls, and equestrian facilities. Fairfax\r\nCounty Park Authority, 1974.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1965 the Park Authority bought the Floyd Kidwell farm next to the\r\noriginal school tract which consisted of some 40 acres with several farm\r\nbuildings. The Kidwells had owned the property since 1934; their farm\r\nbeing the very sort of family operation that proponents of the model\r\nfarm project hoped to show.[296] Money was still scarce for the farm's\r\ndevelopment, however; therefore, most of the land was earmarked for\r\nequestrian use--only a third was set aside for the model farm.\r\nAdditional acreage, purchased in 1974 (and again in 1977) and the\r\nacquisition of the Kidwell farm buildings made more extensive and\r\nauthentic cultivation possible; the farm was finally established in\r\n1974.[297] Because the land was pieced together from numerous sources,\r\nthe farm is presented as a representation of small-scale farming in the\r\ncounty, not an exact recreation of the Kidwell farm. In its patchwork\r\ncomposition, it echoes the trends of the county for few farms stayed\r\nintact during the fluctuations of the 1920s and 1930s, but were added to\r\nor diminished depending on the cash flow.\r\n\r\nModel farms originated in Scandinavia, where entire villages were\r\npreserved during the late 19th century in order to save the folkways\r\nwhich were rapidly eroding in the wake of industrial development. In\r\nthis country the earliest efforts at such preservation took place in the\r\n1940s. They had only scanty growth until a thoughtful article by Marion\r\nClawson was published in _Agricultural History_ in April, 1965. This piece\r\nalerted preservationists and historians to the possibility of such\r\nprojects and influenced the establishment of nearly one hundred such\r\n\"open-air museums,\" among them the National Park Service's Turkey Run\r\nFarm near McLean, Virginia.[298]\r\n\r\nFrying Pan Farm differs from most of these restorations in its portrayal\r\nof 20th century farming, a time and way of working that many older\r\npeople can still recall. Rather than show the slow and hand-operated\r\nlife of a pre-mechanization farmer, Frying Pan Farm shows the farm in a\r\ndynamic transition. In the words of the supervisory board, it recreates\r\na time that \"had not given up the idea of home-cured meats, home\r\nvegetable gardens, home orchards, apple butter, sorghum molasses ... but\r\nit was considering the use of farm tractors, milking machines, and\r\ntractor-drawn equipment....\"[299] The farm thus portrays crop and\r\npasturage rotation, and some mechanized activity with a 1940 tractor,\r\nyet the farmer harvests his grain with a horse-drawn binder. Most of the\r\nequipment is from the pre-World War II period and animals have been\r\nchosen or bred to conform to those available in the 1930s. A volunteer\r\nprogram, established in 1976, aids the farmer in tending the large\r\nvegetable garden, and the livestock which consists of poultry, hogs,\r\nrabbits, goats, sheep, dairy cows and draft horses. Frying Pan Farm\r\ncultivates corn, wheat and hay crops and includes a late-19th century\r\nfarmstead, a frame barn, shed, henhouse, and rabbit hutch and a machine\r\nand separator shed. An orchard and additional crop acreage and fencing\r\nare planned. Far from being a zoo or a site of isolated craft or\r\nmechanical demonstrations, the farm is operated daily as if agriculture\r\nwere its only aim. Crops are grown not merely for show but to feed the\r\nanimal stock and manure is used to fertilize garden and grain fields.\r\nThe visitor who stops by the farm does not see a prearranged\r\ninterpretive display, but chances on the farmer performing that day's\r\nnecessary work: milking, haying, repairing fences, or plowing.[300]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laura Parham and Kim Stanton work in the vegetable garden\r\nat Frying Pan Farm.

The barn\r\nhouses livestock such as horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and dairy cows.\r\nPhoto, Fairfax County Park Authority.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farm boasts one structure not properly belonging to it, but\r\nnonetheless most relevant to the interpretation of early 20th century\r\nfarm life: the Moffett Blacksmith Shop. The shop was owned by Henry\r\nMoffett and stood in Herndon for 70 years, from 1904 until the Frying\r\nPan Park Supervisory Board bought it in 1974. At this time the shop was\r\ntorn down and reassembled near the model farm as a memorial to their\r\nformer chairman (and donor of the funds to save the Moffett Shop),\r\nHatcher Ankers. Henry Moffett, realizing that the advent of the tractor\r\nand automobile would eliminate the need for his business, displayed\r\nconsiderable foresight by collecting blacksmithing tools all over the\r\nWashington area. His shop now houses some of this equipment and another\r\nportion is in the Smithsonian Institution, though Moffett no longer does\r\nany smithing. The park offers courses in ornamental iron working at the\r\nshop.[301]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Moffett Blacksmith Shop at Frying Pan Park\r\nemphasizes the interdependence of farmer and smith. The machinist of his\r\nday, the blacksmith repaired wagon tongues, and mended heavy plows and\r\nother farm equipment. As late as the 20th century, the smith produced\r\ntools, and ornamental items in addition to his steady business of\r\nshoeing horses. His work required a sensitive understanding of farming\r\nand the quirks and habits of the farmer and his animals. Henry Moffett\r\nhimself owned a farm, giving him special insight into the\r\nagriculturalist's needs, a factor which may have been partially\r\nresponsible for the comparative success and longevity of his business.\r\n\"I had more trade than any man around here,\" Moffett admitted. \"During\r\nthe Depression we showed more profit per man than any other business.\"\r\nBlacksmithing was a trade which required skill, but also courage, to\r\nwield heavy instruments, work with molten metals and face stiff\r\ncompetition and the sometimes ugly customers. Henry Moffett seems to\r\nhave combined these qualities with a rare integrity. When competition\r\nbecame keen among the many Herndon forges, Moffett refused to resort to\r\nthe accepted practice of defaming the other smiths to build up his own\r\nbusiness. Stated Moffett, \"I figured if I can't make it without bringing\r\nsomebody else down I shouldn't bother.\"[302]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The farmer's house at Frying Pan Farm.

The shed, built in 1918, was used continually in the early\r\ntwentieth century to house exhibits and fairs. Copy of photo in\r\nVirginiana Collection, Fairfax County Public Library.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe continuance of farming and limited blacksmithing in the Floris area\r\nprovides a continuity with earlier eras that is also reflected in the\r\nequestrian and youth activities of the park. The site of the old Floris\r\nSchool was used during the 1930s for the Floris Community Fair and has\r\nfor several decades been the site of the 4-H fair, which features many\r\nof the same activities as earlier exhibitions. A description of the 4-H\r\nfair of 1976 reads much as the accounts of 40 years previous:\r\n\r\n     Highlight of the opening ceremonies on Thursday evening, August 5,\r\n     will be a goat-milking contest.... The program will open 7:30 p.m.\r\n     with the posting of the colors by twenty 4-H members on\r\n     horseback.... Projects on exhibit will include everything from\r\n     animals to a rocketry display.... Six performances of local dance\r\n     and instrumental groups have been scheduled and square dancing will\r\n     take place at 2 p.m. Saturday. Horse shows will run continuously in\r\n     the park's two rings during both days.... In addition the Extension\r\n     Homemakers Club will present more than 20 working crafts exhibits\r\n     on how to make everything from cottage cheese to doll-house\r\n     furniture....[303]\r\n\r\nIn addition, several minor judgings are held each year. During 1970 for\r\nexample, events at the park included a poultry judging, four dog shows,\r\nfour sewing club events and one rabbit show.[304] Agriculturally\r\noriented youth groups are also encouraged to meet at the park, and the\r\nmaster plan for development of Frying Pan Park calls for space for home\r\neconomics and mechanical shops, areas for crafts instruction, an\r\nagriculture library, and dormitory rooms. In all of these pursuits,\r\nFrying Pan Park carries on the traditions of professional training in\r\nthe field of agriculture established by the Floris Vocational High\r\nSchool.[305]\r\n\r\nThe use of park space for equestrian activities likewise mirrors the\r\ncounty citizens' continued interest in rural pleasures. The horse shows\r\nand facilities are the park's most popular feature, drawing over a\r\nthousand people per day for some events. Fifty-five equestrian events\r\nwere staged in 1976, and the schedule now includes three Class \"A\"\r\nweekend shows sponsored by the American Quarterhorse Association, and\r\njudging for points in dressage, jumping, and other standard events. The\r\nconstruction of an indoor show ring was begun in the summer of 1979, and\r\nis expected to further expand the park's activities, especially\r\nproviding space for winter shows. The park also expects to continue its\r\nprogram of week-long camps for pony clubs, and its extensive network of\r\nbridle paths.[306]\r\n\r\nFrying Pan Park is unique both in its attempt to interpret a style of\r\nliving which has not yet completely vanished, and in its combination of\r\neducational and recreational facilities. Its aim is not merely to\r\ndisplay old-fashioned implements or provide for the enjoyment of a\r\nspecial interest group. Rather it seeks to maintain a tradition of\r\ninterest in rural life and culture by continuing to pursue it actively.\r\nThe trials, hopes, and quiet pleasures of the countryside can be best\r\nappreciated where the farm is a living entity. The richness of the\r\nfarmer's achievement is evident to the park's visitors through fairs,\r\nhorse shows, and simply in gazing at a lushly billowing field of corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dressage competition at Frying Pan Park, 1978.
