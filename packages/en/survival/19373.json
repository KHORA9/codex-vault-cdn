M., Tuesday, December 9, 1919, in the Annex\r\nParlor of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, Battle Creek, Michigan, with the\r\nPresident, W. C. Reed, presiding.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was opened with a short business session beginning with the\r\nPresident's report as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S ADDRESS\r\n\r\nW. C. REED, VINCENNES, IND.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW MEMBERS, NORTHERN NUT GROWERS ASSOCIATION, LADIES AND\r\nGENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nOur Association meets today under the most favorable surroundings. We\r\nhave this splendid building in which to hold our meetings, furnished\r\ngratuitously also have with us in this wonderful Institution several\r\nthousand guests, men and women of ability and prominence in their\r\nrespective communities, from all parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg has been very kind and generous in extending an invitation\r\nseveral times to this association, and your speaker has thought there\r\nwas no place quite so well suited for a winter meeting. It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to be able to be with you and preside over a meeting as\r\nthe guests of Dr. Kellogg. There is probably no man in America who has\r\ndone so much to further the use of nuts, to show their benefits, and to\r\nexplain their uses, as a food for mankind.\r\n\r\nConditions have changed greatly since our last meeting, September 1917,\r\nat Stamford, Connecticut. At that time the greater part of the world was\r\nat war, and owing to conditions prevailing during 1918, it was\r\nimpossible for this association to hold its annual meeting. Your speaker\r\nis still holding the office of President because you have had no meeting\r\nat which new officers could be elected. It is to be regretted that the\r\npast three years have been crowded so full of events, that it was\r\nimpossible to give the association matters the attention they deserved,\r\nand devote the time to them I would have liked to have done.\r\n\r\nWith the armistice came a cessation of war, and we are all happy that\r\nthe terrible struggle is over, but with it have come conditions that\r\nare almost as terrible as war. Famine and want stare millions of people\r\nin the face on the continent of Europe. Our own country is at present in\r\nthe grip of strikes for higher wages, the like of which has never been\r\nknown. Yet we are prosperous beyond the greatest dreams of any nation on\r\nearth, but with this prosperity comes many duties. Our yields of food\r\ncrops have been great, but to us has fallen the lot of feeding the\r\nworld, and this will continue until industrial and agricultural\r\nconditions of Europe, have been reestablished on a pre-war condition.\r\n\r\nThere never was a time when meats of all kinds were so expensive, and to\r\nmany almost prohibitive. Many have learned the use of nut meats in\r\nvaried ways until all kinds of edible nuts are quoted on the markets\r\ntoday at prices undreamed of in former years. These conditions will not\r\nalways last; crop failures will come; and production will be curtailed.\r\nLand values are advancing so rapidly that the production of cheap meats\r\nwill be impossible. To help supply this deficiency, there will be an\r\nincreased demand for nuts of all kinds.\r\n\r\nTo help meet this demand, much can be done by road side planting. On our\r\nmain market highways, such trees as the grafted black walnuts could be\r\nplanted profitably, in many sections of the country; the English walnut\r\nin some parts where they succeed the best; and the pecan and chestnut in\r\nother parts of the country where they are specially adapted.\r\n\r\nWhile commercial planting of nut trees may not be attractive to the\r\naverage man, home planting of a few nut trees can be recommended for\r\nevery where space is available. They will make beautiful shade trees,\r\nand produce crops that will eventually be of great value. To land owners\r\nwho are planting private parks, avenues and pastures, we would recommend\r\nnut trees.\r\n\r\nThe production of nut trees is very difficult, and the development and\r\ntesting of new varieties, a slow and expensive process. We need the\r\nGovernment's helping hand, and are very glad that there has been set\r\naside by Congress an appropriation to help develop this industry. We\r\nhave with us, the Nut Culturist from the Department of Agriculture, who\r\nis devoting his entire time along these lines.\r\n\r\nOn the programme that is to be presented here, today and tomorrow, are\r\nmen of national reputation in their respective lines, who stand at the\r\nhead of their profession. To our friends and visitors here, we extend an\r\nurgent invitation, that you attend all the meetings possible, and we\r\ntrust that you may learn much that will be of interest, and that this\r\ninformation may be taken home to your different communities.\r\n\r\nOur sincere thanks should be extended to the Programme Committee and our\r\nvery efficient Secretary who have given so much time to this work.\r\n\r\nFor an association to stand still, is usually to go backward. Owing to\r\nwar conditions, and missing one meeting, we have had little chance to\r\nincrease our membership. I sincerely trust that the Membership Committee\r\nwill be active while here, and extend an invitation to all to become\r\nmembers, and to help advance an industry that will be for the good of\r\nposterity, and should give us much pleasure during our own lifetime.\r\n\r\nWe are told, the good we do unto others lives after us. May the Nut\r\nTrees planted and fostered by the members of this association, live long\r\nto wave their leafy branches under Heaven's purple dome, and may weary\r\npilgrims of future generations rest beneath their shade, and enjoy their\r\nfruits, thanking us with a silent prayer that these trees were planted\r\nfor their benefit.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I believe the next thing in order will be the\r\nreading of the secretary's and treasurer's reports. Does any one have\r\nanything to present while we are waiting for the secretary, who is busy?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: How many members have we, Mr. President?\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I don't know. Several have written me asking\r\nabout members, and Mr. Olcott probably knows something about it.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I don't know how many there are now; but I think\r\nthere were 150 or 200 at the time of the Stamford meeting. I think there\r\nwere that many enrolled. I presume that two-thirds of those\r\nrenewed--probably something over 100 members.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: There were 138 paid members.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Dr. Kellogg says there may be a thousand men in the\r\naudience this evening, and if there are we ought to do some propaganda\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I don't remember who the membership committee\r\nwas. Mr. Weber was chairman, I believe, and he is not here. Olcott is\r\nnext on the committee.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I didn't know I was on that committee.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Fagan was on that committee, Potter, Deming,\r\nWilliams, J. Russell Smith. I guess you are the only member of the\r\ncommittee who is here.

A. REED, for Auditing Committee.\r\n\r\n     The above are records of receipts and expenditures for two years\r\n     and three months and are approximately double those noted in the\r\n     report of of the Stamford meeting. The activities of the\r\n     Association were necessarily at a low ebb in war time, and,\r\n     although a joint meeting with the National Association was planned\r\n     for the fall of 1918, it was never held.\r\n\r\n     The list of members printed in this report numbers 128 while that\r\n     in the last one shows 166, apparently a very large decrease. The\r\n     last report showed 138 paid up members. Following the methods of\r\n     Secretary Deming, members who have not responded to notices and\r\n     letters have been dropped. In no case has a member been dropped\r\n     until a letter with return postage has been sent. In a number of\r\n     instances members thus written to have resigned giving various\r\n     reasons, the most common of which are change of occupation or\r\n     residence, which prevented their doing anything in the line of nut\r\n     growing or lack of success in their attempts to grow nuts. Two\r\n     members have died since the last meeting, Mr. Wendell P. Williams\r\n     and Mr. Mahlon Hutchinson; the former was in the U. S. Service at\r\n     the time of his death. 57 new members have been added to our rolls\r\n     since 1917 making a total of 410 joining since organization of whom\r\n     we now have 128, 282 having dropped out. Of the 52 who have joined\r\n     since last meeting, 21 joined before Oct. 1, 1919 the date of the\r\n     proposed meeting in Albany, Ga., which was never held, and 31 since\r\n     that date.\r\n\r\n     The holding of members is a difficult problem and one that has not\r\n     been worked out at all satisfactorily. Most members join in the\r\n     hope of thereby learning how to successfully grow nut trees. They\r\n     find out that so much is still experimental that most do not\r\n     remain. This is bound to continue till we can show grafted or\r\n     budded nut trees bearing satisfactory crops, and, until that time,\r\n     there seems nothing to do but to keep on going after new members\r\n     and by means of bulletins, reports, letters and otherwise making\r\n     the membership more valuable than ever. There has been a greater\r\n     interest in nut growing during the past fall than at any time since\r\n     your Secretary-Treasurer has held office.\r\n\r\n     Respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n  WILLARD G. BIXBY,\r\n  Secretary-Treasurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: You have heard the report. What is your\r\npleasure? I believe that is usually referred to an auditing committee.\r\nC. A. Reed was chairman of that committee.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: Mr. Reed spoke to me about this yesterday. He said\r\nhe would be glad to audit it, but there has not been time to give it to\r\nhim. It was ready for him this morning, but he was busy on other things.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: What is the next thing on the program, Mr.\r\nSecretary?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: The reports of committees. I do not know how much\r\nreport the standing committees have.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: There is the executive committee, the finance\r\ncommittee, the hybrids committee--maybe Dr. Morris has something on\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: No, I have no report to make on that. I shall talk\r\non the subject this afternoon or in the course of my paper incidentally.\r\nI didn't see any occasion for action in that direction since the last\r\nmeeting, so I have not acted except incidentally in the course of my\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: The committee on nomenclature--of course they\r\nwouldn't have any report until after this meeting.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: Who is on that committee?--C. A. Reed, Dr. Morris,\r\nand J. F. Jones. Two members of the committee are here. There is one\r\nmatter which perhaps I better bring up to the committee first,--one\r\nmatter I think they should take some action on.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I think it would be best to have that come up\r\nat a later time.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: I would like to bring in something incidentally in\r\nrelation to nomenclature in my paper. Perhaps we could have the question\r\ndiscussed after I have brought up that point.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: There is a committee on promising seedlings C.\r\nA. Reed, and J. F. Jones. I think that covers all the standing\r\ncommittees. Wasn't there a committee on nominations for officers to be\r\nelected, this morning?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: That nominating committee has to be elected.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: How many members?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: There were four or five last time, I think.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: (Reading by-laws calling for five members).\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I move Mr. Olcott be on the committee.\r\n\r\nVOICE: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: It has been moved and seconded that Mr. Olcott\r\nbe elected as a member of the nominating committee. All in favor say,\r\nAye. It is so ordered. Who else shall we have, for a second member?\r\n\r\nMR. LINTON: I move Mr. Bixby be a member of the committee.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: There is a precedent that the secretary has never\r\nbeen a member of the nominating committee. He has sometimes given them\r\ninformation. I move Dr. Morris, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Linton be members of\r\nthe nominating committee, and Mr. McGlennon.\r\n\r\nMR. MCGLENNON: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: The committee as you suggested it is Dr. Morris,\r\nMr. J. F. Jones, Mr. Linton, Mr. McGlennon and myself?\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: You have heard the motion. All in favor say\r\nAye. The committee stands elected as named. They report at tomorrow\r\nmorning's meeting. I think there is one matter it would be well to bring\r\nup, and that is the membership committee.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I was going to suggest that is an important matter,\r\nand I think that committee should be filled out with those who are\r\npresent, inasmuch as the regular members are not here. It looks as\r\nthough a comparatively small membership would have to double up on\r\nmembership committee.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Have you any suggestions as to whom you want on\r\nthat committee?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: Those committees, with the exception of the\r\nnominating committee, are appointed by the president. I think myself\r\nthat the new president appoints them.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: My idea was to appoint for this meeting and\r\nhelp Mr. Olcott out.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I suggest Mr. McGlennon and Mr. Jones as two of the\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Let it stand as it is with the three and give\r\nthe chairman power to appoint two more later.\r\n\r\nMR. MCGLENNON: Can the secretary tell us how many members there\r\nare?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: One hundred sixty-four notices of this meeting were\r\nsent out. There are 128 paid up members.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: On the matter of membership, I wonder if the\r\nassociation could suggest some inducement for membership, or summarize\r\nthe inducements. As you know, the American Association of Nurserymen has\r\nbeen desirous of more members, and they found it very advisable to\r\noutline definitely the benefits of membership in that association. I am\r\nwondering if that has been done recently and could not be emphasized in\r\nsome way to the advantage of larger membership. You have got to do\r\nsomething more than say that there is in existence an association\r\ndevoted to these purposes and everybody is invited to come in. Maybe the\r\nsecretary has something on that line.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I have no suggestion. It is very evident that there\r\nis a greatly increased interest in nut growing over what there was when\r\nI first took up the office. That is very clearly brought out by the\r\namount of mail received. You may know that Capt. Deming, when in the\r\nservice, took the position of editing the nut department of the American\r\nFruit Grower. I saw him recently and it looks to me as if, as editor of\r\nthat department, he is answering about as many correspondents on nuts\r\nand trying to boost the association in that way as he did when he was\r\nsecretary before. And that would appear to be in addition to the\r\ncommunications that are coming to me now.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: There is interest. We get at the Journal office a\r\ngreat quantity of inquiries but only a small per cent of them result in\r\nmemberships and subscriptions, and while this interest is so strong,\r\nought not this association to study that which is something of a\r\nproblem--perhaps something that ought to be taken up in view of the\r\ninterests and the benefits of the association shown.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I think that is a good suggestion. I think they\r\nneed something along that line. Is there anything else we want to bring\r\nup at this morning session?\r\n\r\nMR. MCGLENNON: Is this not a very good field to open up\r\noperations along that line, right here at Battle Creek? A large number\r\nof people who come here are people who eat nuts, and I believe that\r\ncondition would resolve itself into a material advance of membership. I\r\nthink we ought to get busy right here and see if we can not enlist the\r\nmembership of a great number of the patrons of this institution.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: That was the principal object of the membership\r\ncommittee I suppose. My idea was to get the ideas of the individual\r\nmembers, put them together and present a broadside of benefits in this\r\norganization rather than have one man attempt to outline them.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: There is an immense amount of interest. The\r\nquestion is how to get it together and formulate it in such a way that\r\nmen will join. There is an enormous, large loose majority, and we must\r\nhave a small compact minority to swing it as the Senators do down at\r\nWashington, you know. Prof. Murrill of the New York Botanical Garden\r\ntold me that wherever he went (he is interested in mushrooms, that is\r\nhis special subject) he had had no idea in the world there was so much\r\ninterest of the public in mushrooms; yet when it comes to getting\r\ntogether members to form the base of an association to study the\r\nsubject, he finds very few members. It is simply because men haven't got\r\nthe habit, and we have got in some way to give direction to that in such\r\na way that it will be focused and concentrated on some one objective\r\npoint. How to do it, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: Dr. Kellogg suggested that at the meeting this\r\nevening there will be the largest number of people, not members, that\r\nthere has been at any meeting; and he said he had had requests from\r\npeople that they wanted to hear Dr. Morris, and they wanted to hear\r\nProf. Cajori who used to be here, and he asked me to change those from\r\nthis afternoon to this evening in order to accomplish that, and I said\r\nwe would switch the program. That was for that very purpose.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: Mr. President, it just occurred to me that in view\r\nof the number of inquiries we get, and I am sure the secretary gets, and\r\nI am also sure Dr. Deming gets from his articles, there is no doubt of\r\nthe interest, yet the joining of this Northern Association, and the\r\nattendance of its single annual meeting, does not appeal to many. They\r\ndo not find it convenient to attend the convention; they do not see any\r\ngreat amount of benefit in the membership. It occurs to me that if we\r\nhad a list of state vice-presidents and each of those could provide for\r\nsome local gathering of people interested in nut culture in the various\r\ncommunities; rather, I would say that if our members, as fast as we can\r\nincrease our membership, wherever they are located, would form a nucleus\r\nof a little circle in their neighborhood, and have them affiliated with\r\nthe Northern Association; it would accomplish this result. And afterward\r\nit occurred to me that perhaps that could be done through state\r\nvice-presidents. But what is really needed is to get them together in\r\nmeetings. They won't come yet. They will when you get a larger\r\nmembership, but they won't come to the annual meeting of this\r\nassociation where I think they would go to a community affair and talk\r\nover matters and refer difficult problems to the Northern Association of\r\nwhich they were affiliated members. In some way, a wheel within a wheel\r\ncould work at it that way, and we could increase membership in that way.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: It is a rule in psychology that you have got to\r\nhave personal interest first. If Mr. Olcott's idea of having a local\r\nvice-president offer prizes, no matter how small, for nuts in the\r\nvicinity, and would also state that any one finding some remarkable nut\r\nwould have that nut named after him to go down to all time, you would\r\nhave two points there in self-interest. First, a five dollar prize to\r\nthe best nut; next the name going rattling down through time in\r\nassociation with it. There are two points of personal interest. We may\r\nas well take it back to the basic principles and begin with the\r\npsychology of the situation.\r\n\r\nMR. KETCHUM: Mr. President, in regard to these vice-presidents,\r\nthat point looks to me very good for this reason. I saw it work out in\r\nthe Minnesota State Horticultural Society. They had a vice-president in\r\neach congressional district. I was vice-president in the third district\r\none year myself From them reports were sent from their district by\r\npeople who were interested. They were asked to fill out blanks about\r\nconditions as they found them in their neighborhood and we got great\r\ngood from it. Then this vice-president was to make a general district\r\nreport from the reports sent him, and hand it in at the annual meeting.\r\nIt was quite a success.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: There you have civic pride brought into your psychology.\r\n\r\nMR. KETCHUM: That was in the third district which included the\r\nnortheast part of the state. It was quite a large district\r\ngeographically, and I sent out something like seventy of these blank\r\nreports, and while the interest was very slight, I think I got 23 field\r\nreports in return, and out of those 23 were some nine or ten that were\r\nof some considerable importance; but it was a great big help to me in\r\nmaking out my report together with what I knew in my own location. The\r\npercentage of reports that came back showed that there was great\r\ninterest taken by those persons.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: You can arouse local pride in any locality.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I have tried that in our own state in the last\r\ntwo or three years, at county fairs and local district horticultural\r\nmeetings. Several times I have offered prizes out of my own pocket\r\nindividually; then I have gotten other parties to help in some cases,\r\nand some exhibits even at county farmers' institutes, even very\r\ncreditable exhibits and they seemed to attract as much interest even as\r\nthe school exhibits. I know of one case at Martinsville two years ago\r\nthis winter where the nut exhibit was almost as large as the fruit\r\nexhibit, and I think it attracted more attention; and I think there was\r\nonly something like ten dollars spent in order to get it out. I think\r\nthat work along that line, missionary work of that kind, is going to do\r\nus more good than almost any other endeavor.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I do not think that the industry is old enough or\r\nstrong enough yet, perhaps, to operate that state vice-president plan as\r\nit would be perhaps later on, for this reason, that if you have a state\r\nvice-president, you narrow the activity in that state to that immediate\r\nlocality. But it would probably be much better, instead of that, to\r\nendeavor to get each member to form the nucleus of a local circle, and\r\nso have ten or a dozen in a state, instead of one.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I think that suggestion is better.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: That was my original idea, and the state\r\nvice-president idea came in afterwards.\r\n\r\nMR. MCGLENNON: How many states are included in the northern association\r\nterritory?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: There is no limit.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Northern is a relative term.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I don't think there is any clearly defined line\r\nwhere the Northern Association is.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: For the reason that men live in the North are\r\ninterested in lands in the South, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: There are twenty-three vice-presidents on the\r\nlist here, in the last published report. Is there anything else that\r\nshould come up at the morning session? Mr. Secretary, do you know of\r\nanything else?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I would really like to see something definite on\r\nthis line of increasing the membership. I can think of several things\r\nthat will help; but to get something that is going to have action right\r\naway is not so clear. Recently I have had a good many people come down\r\nto my place to look at the small orchard I have there. I aim to have\r\nvarieties of every nut tree that is being propagated, and I think if I\r\nkeep at it a few years longer I will pretty nearly have them; and in\r\nmost cases, when people have come down that way, they have become\r\nmembers afterwards. Two or three of them have. I am only twenty miles\r\nfrom New York City, and it is not difficult, if I find someone\r\ninterested, to invite them down to look over the trees growing there,\r\nand usually when they come they join afterwards.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: Pardon me for speaking again, but I am on the\r\nmembership committee and I am anxious to draw out anything that may be\r\nof use. Why could not some plan be devised by the secretary or by this\r\ncommittee and sent out tentatively in the way of suggestion and perhaps\r\nsome other suggestions will be made to add to it. Perhaps also in\r\naddition to this local community plan that I suggested, there might be\r\nformed, all of it within the Northern Association, a subsidiary\r\nthereto--the walnut society--people particularly interested in the\r\nwalnut, but do not care for the hickory, pecan or any other nut. You\r\nwill find people particularly interested in the black walnut, some in\r\nthe Persian walnut, some in the filbert--form a filbert society as the\r\nAmerican Nut Journal has suggested, and let all the enthusiasts of the\r\nfilbert get together, and if they are scattered, let them keep together\r\nby correspondence and increased activity in that way. The same for the\r\nbutternut. Get at it from that way.\r\n\r\nMR. KETCHUM: Another thing to further our society here today,\r\nwe can make those small organizations auxiliary thereto.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Any one who is interested in one nut becomes\r\ninterested in all eventually.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I received more inquiries regarding the Persian\r\nwalnut and the pecan than any other nuts--probably more regarding the\r\nPersian walnut. Nearly everybody who writes wants to grow Persian\r\nwalnuts; and in the great majority of instances, I have to try to switch\r\nthem onto black walnuts with the suggestion that they plant a few\r\nPersian walnuts because we have no experimental data of the Persian\r\nwalnut succeeding in their section. In some instances they will turn to\r\nthe black walnuts; in other instances I hear nothing further from them.\r\nThe Persian walnut is the most popular with people who have not tried to\r\ngrow any nuts. Mr. Jones perhaps can tell us how his inquiries run.\r\nDon't they run very largely for Persian walnuts?\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: Yes, they do. I was thinking possibly you could make\r\na combination--take, for instance, the membership, the nut journal, and\r\nsome nut trees. The nurserymen could make considerable concession.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: That combination is right well.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: You could give a coupon good for so much on an order\r\nfor trees or something of that sort.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: That suggestion was made and I referred it to the\r\nexecutive committee. I have not had any reply.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I didn't have time to answer the communication\r\nand get it back to you before I came here; so I thought we would decide\r\non that here. If there is nothing further to come up this morning, a\r\nmotion to adjourn will be in order until the afternoon session.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I might repeat that at the request of Dr. Kellogg,\r\nin order to get the papers which he had been particularly requested to\r\nhave given so that people could hear them, Dr. Morris and Prof. Cajori\r\nwho were scheduled this afternoon, will come this evening, and Mr.\r\nHoover's and Mr. Graves' papers, which were scheduled for this evening,\r\nwill have to come this afternoon. Neither of the writers are present,\r\nbut the papers are here. Mr. Graves expected to be here but I had a\r\ntelegram yesterday that he could not get away. I have the paper, though\r\nand the photographs.\r\n\r\nMR. MCGLENNON: Has there been provision made for a paper on\r\nfilberts by Mr. Vollertsen? If not, I should like to have it.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: Certainly, there can be. It ought to come in this\r\nafternoon. I wrote Mr. Vollertsen asking if he could deliver it.\r\n\r\nMR. MCGLENNON: He has the paper prepared, and I want to hear\r\nit. I have been closely associated with Mr. Vollertsen for some ten\r\nyears, and I know that his whole heart and soul are in the development\r\nof the filbert; and I know what he has done and that he is a rare\r\ncharacter in the nut world today, that he possesses a fund of\r\ninformation. I am sure you will find intensely interesting; and\r\nfurthermore I would suggest, and I believe I speak for him when I say I\r\nhope you will feel free to ask him questions. As I said before, he has a\r\nfund of information that I think we nut people ought to have, and the\r\ngeneral public as well. We have a very good exhibit of the nuts. Mr.\r\nVollertsen is the practical man in the enterprise we are interested in.\r\nI look after the business end of it. We are equally interested in it and\r\nfeel that we have made some progress.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Put Mr. McGlennon on too.\r\n\r\nMR. MCGLENNON: I have said all I can say.\r\n\r\nMR. VOLLERTSEN: You have said too much.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: If there is nothing else, we will stand\r\nadjourned until 2:30 p. m.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  TUESDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 9, 1919, 2:30 P. M.\r\n  PRESIDENT W. C. REED, IN THE CHAIR\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: The first paper is by Mr. Hoover, Matthew Henry\r\nHoover, of Lockport, N. Y., president of the New York State Conservation\r\nAssociation. Mr. Hoover is not here, and the Secretary will read his\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARMS BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD\r\n\r\n  BY MATTHEW HENRY HOOVER, LOCKPORT, N. Y.\r\n  FORMERLY NEW YORK CONSERVATION COMMISSIONER\r\n  PRESIDENT NEW YORK STATE CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley is best known for his contribution to the abolition of\r\nhuman slavery in the United States. Yet his service to mankind is not\r\nfully appraised by the average American, because many of the younger\r\ngeneration are unaware of his aid to agriculture. His maxim about\r\nfarmers' failing to till the most valuable part of their farms\r\nunderneath, opening the eyes of agriculturists to the efficacy of\r\nsub-soil plowing, was the preamble to freeing American husbandry from\r\nthe slavery of antiquated and unscientific methods.\r\n\r\nFollowing the application of science to the cultivation of the soil,\r\ncame the students of Conservation. They were teaching the farmer the\r\nrelation of conservation of natural resources to agriculture, the\r\neffects of forests on rainfall, moisture, erosion of soil, minimization\r\nof floods that annually bury thousands of acres of arable lands in the\r\nvalleys, under rocky debris and so on.\r\n\r\nGreeley discovered the Farm Below. The Conservationists are saving the\r\nFarm Above.\r\n\r\nNow, in these days of reclamation and reconstruction, it is high time to\r\npay more attention to the Farm by the Side of the Road.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Nut Growers' Association is to be congratulated upon the\r\nfact that it is blazing the trail through the forest of popular\r\nignorance on this vitally important conservation question; leading\r\npublic thought in the right direction; and providing both the seed and\r\nthe stock for practical efforts in behalf of the Farm by the Side of the\r\nRoad. I am going to claim a bond of brotherhood with you in this great\r\nwork, basing my claim not upon my small activities in nut cultivation,\r\nbut rather upon the fact that I was one of the conservation pioneers in\r\nNew York State in the advocacy of planting profitable trees--nut trees\r\nand fruit trees--along the public highways.\r\n\r\nThat eminent conservationist, Gifford Pinchot, addressing the National\r\nCouncil of Farmers' Co-operative Associations in 1915, defined\r\n\"Conservation\" as \"the wise use of the earth for the benefit of the\r\npeople who live on it.\" That would be a perfect definition, if it did\r\nnot invite the query: Should it not be enjoined upon the people who live\r\nupon the earth today, while enjoying its benefits, to keep faithful\r\nstewardship of the interests of the inhabitants of tomorrow?\r\n\r\nAbout the time Mr. Pinchot enunciated this famous definition, the New\r\nYork State Conservation Department summed up the purposes of practical\r\nConservation as: \"The correction of past indiscretion, the perfection of\r\npresent utilization, and the formation of future accumulation with\r\nrespect to natural resources.\"\r\n\r\nConservation activities must repair errors of the past which have left\r\ndenuded forest lands and empty game covers and waters; they must afford\r\nand direct the present use of the forests and the streams; they must\r\nsafeguard the future supply, if they would meet the requirements of a\r\nconservation which shall raise the standards of life and lower the cost\r\nof living. That is a conservation embracing both the aesthetic and the\r\neconomic, the only kind worth while. It is a conservation wherein the\r\narable areas and the so-called waste lands and waters have a very\r\nintimate interrelation of interests. And, I submit, Gentlemen, that the\r\nAmerican people too long have failed to recognize and to account as in\r\nthe class of waste lands, \"The Farms by the Side of the Road.\"\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of waste lands is a compromise between the activities of\r\nthe Conservationists, who claim that in the more thickly inhabited\r\nportions of the United States the cultivated or semi-cultivated areas\r\nare out of sane and safe proportion to the wild forest sections, and the\r\nadvocates of intensive and extensive agriculture. It is not the purpose\r\nof this article to take sides in that controversy, but rather to invite\r\nattention of both sides to a safe and practical field for their\r\nendeavors, namely, the reclamation of the \"wasted lands\" along the\r\nroadsides, the farms along the highways.\r\n\r\nDuring the War Garden campaigns of the past two years, these heretofore\r\nlargely unused strips of tillable land, forming in the aggregate\r\nthousands of along-the-road acres in every state, received considerable\r\nattention from the thrifty plow and hoe. But in the main, the results\r\nwere not encouraging. The public will trespass, unintentionally or\r\notherwise, upon the land cropped along the highway. Then, if the farms\r\nby the side of the road are to be conserved--used by present as well as\r\nfuture generations--there remains but one practical recourse: productive\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe American people love beautiful trees, possibly the expression of a\r\nreaction from the sentiment of the pioneers who regarded trees as their\r\nenemies, handicaps to agriculture to be removed as thoroughly and\r\nexpeditiously as possible. But with virgin soil producing enormous\r\ncrops, they naturally centered their interest on ornamental trees\r\nwithout reference to their fruits. Hence the horse-chestnut, buck-eye,\r\nmaple, locust, oak, poplar, along the highways and byways of America,\r\ninstead of the native nut trees and the Persian or English walnut.\r\n\r\nAnd, speaking of highways, this is the age of concrete. Taking the hint,\r\nI am selecting one concrete example of which I have intimate and\r\npersonal knowledge, well aware that there are numerous others that I\r\nmight cite were my acquaintance with practical nut culture more\r\nextensive than it is. The one that I know about of my own personal\r\nknowledge is, a very good example of the plain common sense of\r\nproductive trees which combine the useful with the ornamental.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT READS LIKE A FAIRY TALE\r\n\r\nIn 1876 two Niagara County farmers, Norman Pomeroy and Matthew O'Connor,\r\nneighbors, decided to go to the Centennial. They packed one carpet-bag\r\nin common for their baggage and boarded the train for Philadelphia.\r\nAlthough well to do farmers, their economic instincts warned them to\r\nbeware the profiteering hotel keepers. So they sought a humble boarding\r\nhouse in the suburbs of the city. Returning one evening from\r\nsight-seeing at the exposition, the travelers were so weary that they\r\nretired immediately after supper. During the night Pomeroy was awakened\r\nby a tapping on the window. Assuring himself that the wallet under his\r\npillow was still there, he investigated the cause of the disturbance of\r\nhis slumbers. The noise had ceased and he decided that the overstrain of\r\nthe day had worked an hallucination. Pomeroy dropped off to sleep, but\r\npresently was aroused by sounds which were unmistakably caused by a\r\ngentle tapping on the window pane. Exasperated, the man arose, picked up\r\na boot, slipped to the window and raised it gently ready to give the\r\njoker or would-be burglar a rousing whack on the head if within reach.\r\nHe stuck his head out of the window for a better view of the exterior\r\nworld, and his curiosity was rewarded with a stinging blow on the cheek.\r\nThe pain aroused all the Pomeroy French Huguenot fighting blood in his\r\nveins. Viciously he swung the boot at the unseen foe, only to hear it\r\ncrash through tree branches. Laughing softly, in his enlightenment, he\r\nreached out into the night, grasped a branch, broke it off and turned on\r\nthe gas and lit it. On the twig were two curious nuts.\r\n\r\nPomeroy was a lover of nature, as I learned by many an interesting talk\r\nwith him. He found time in his regular farming pursuits to study native\r\ntrees and shrubs, and had forbidden his hired men to cut down any of the\r\nnative nut trees on his 500 acre farm. But the nuts on the branch\r\nretrieved from darkness were specimens new to him and he could hardly\r\nwait for daylight to come to enable him to get acquainted with the tree\r\nwhich had invited his attention so rudely. Next morning Pomeroy learned\r\nthat his new found arboreal friend was a Persian walnut. It was loaded\r\nand the wind storm of the night had covered the ground with shucked and\r\nunshucked nuts. By permission of the landlord, he gathered a peck of the\r\nPersian walnuts, wrapped O'Connor's and his own belongings in a\r\nnewspaper and filled the carpet-bag with the nut treasures. Arriving\r\nhome, the tourists stopped first at O'Connor's house. There they had to\r\nrelate the experience of their great trip to an assemblage of the two\r\nfamilies. The recounting of the Centennial wonders took until midnight.\r\nWhen Pomeroy picked up his carpet-bag to go home, it was empty! The\r\nchildren had made a discrete retirement after having consumed the entire\r\npeck of English walnuts, as the shells in the kitchen disclosed.\r\nLuckily for the youngsters, they were safe in bed and asleep.\r\n\r\nThe next day, according to the elder Pomeroy, little Albert who had not\r\nbeen at the O'Connor home the night before, heard the dolorous tale of\r\nthe wonderful tree in Philadelphia, the gift of nuts and their weird\r\ndisappearance. To confirm the sad story he picked up the carpet-bag,\r\nturned it inside out. Within a torn lining, he triumphantly extracted\r\nten nuts. Child-like, he proceeded to sample them and had eaten three\r\nwhen his father rescued the remainder. Seven Philadelphia walnuts were\r\nplanted in the yard, and, in due time there were seven slender,\r\nsilver-grayish seedling trees. These were carefully staked, guarded and\r\ncultivated by Norman Pomeroy. Despite the caviling of the neighbors, who\r\ndeclared that a Persian walnut tree would not thrive and bear so far\r\nnorth, twelve years after planting the \"lucky seven\" reproduced their\r\nkind--from a dozen to two dozen large, handsome Persian or English\r\nwalnuts. Today the seven Centennial trees are about two feet in diameter\r\nand about 60 feet high. And as to the value of the crop, one tree alone\r\nproduced nuts which sold four years ago for $142.50.\r\n\r\nNow as to the application of this romance in real life. I must return to\r\nthe more prosaic generalizations of conservation and its relation to the\r\nproducts of cultivation with which this article began.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 Governor Martin H. Glynn invited me to outline for him a program\r\nof \"Practical and Progressive Conservation\", applicable to the needs of\r\nNew York State. In the effort to meet the request, I drew a little from\r\nmy personal experience and observations as a sportsman, a farmer and a\r\nnewspaper man, and a great deal from what I had learned from others\r\namong the organized sportsmen, agricultural societies, hydro-electric\r\nengineers, forest products men, foresters, and nature lovers in general.\r\nWe then set forth the following as necessary to the realization of the\r\npurposes of a Conservation which should meet all conditions imposed by\r\nthe past, the present and the future, as hereinbefore stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PRACTICAL AND PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATION\"\r\n\r\n1. Protect the birds and save the crops.\r\n\r\n2. Develop the unutilized water powers, now going to waste with\r\ndestructive effects in freshet periods to arable lands and thickly\r\npopulated communities, through public ownership and distribution;\r\nthereby use \"The People's White Coal,\" save coal and cussin' the\r\nash-sifter, giving the public cheaper light and power for the homes, the\r\nfarms, the factories, and public highways.\r\n\r\n3. Amend the constitution to permit the use of dead and down timber in\r\nthe state forest preserves, worth at least $10,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\n4. Provide free forest trees furnished by the state for all who will\r\nplant them. (Note--The present N. Y. Conservation Commission in a\r\nspecial report to be made to the Legislature of 1920 has at last adopted\r\nthat progressive policy).\r\n\r\n5. Plant productive trees along the highways--nut and fruit trees.\r\n\r\n6. Restock waters and covers more extensively and intelligently.\r\n\r\n7. Stop pollution of private and public waters.\r\n\r\n8. Harmonize the interrelated interests of farmers and sportsmen.\r\n\r\n9. Establish game and bird refuges in every county in the state.\r\n\r\n10. Sane and practical game laws, eliminating prosecutions on petty\r\ntechnicalities, educate the public to co-operate in fish and game\r\nprotection, enact legislation to encourage rather than handicap the\r\npropagation of fish and game by private enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that plank 5 in our progressive conservation platform\r\nis urging the planting of producing trees along the highways. By that we\r\nmeant not only the native nut trees, all of which are beautiful and\r\nornamental, but also fruit trees, according to the wishes of the\r\nabutting owners.\r\n\r\nIn the State of New York, taking into account only improved roads coming\r\nunder the head of State or County Improved Highways, disregarding the\r\nmileage of the rural roads several times as large, there are about 8,000\r\nmiles of \"Good Roads\". There are many stretches of the highways which\r\nnature has generously adorned with trees. Some portions of the roads\r\nhave witnessed the spoliation of the contractor's indiscriminating ax,\r\nbut in the main the workmen were as careful as possible to retain\r\nnatural shade trees along the routes. A few miles comparatively, were\r\nplanted by state agencies. Farmers, especially in the Lake Ontario Fruit\r\nBelt of New York State, have worked wonders in ornamentation and economy\r\nby planting cherry, apple, plum and other beautiful and productive trees\r\non the strip of land, \"The Farms by the Side of the Road.\"\r\n\r\nAt a very small additional expense, the State could have planted every\r\nrod of improved highway with productive trees, putting that\r\nforethoughtful specification into the contracts.\r\n\r\nGet out your pencil for a moment. Suppose the state had English walnuts\r\non the 8,000 miles, placing the trees 40 feet apart. We should have\r\ngrowing then over one million productive trees and some of them would be\r\nold enough to be bearing today. Within ten years from now, their\r\nproduct would be worth at a conservative estimate $25 per tree,\r\nrepresenting a sum sufficient to carry one-third of the State's entire\r\ncost of government.\r\n\r\nThe war just won for the cause of World Democracy has opened the eyes of\r\nthe American people to many things they had not before apprehended or\r\nrealized. One is the value of productive land space. Another is the\r\nimportance of our forests, and especially the value of the native\r\nnut-bearing trees. It was discovered, when Uncle Sam scurried around to\r\nprocure a supply of black walnut for gun stocks, that the German agents\r\nhad been ahead of him. Although thickly settled, Germany finds it\r\nprofitable to employ one-fourth of its entire area in growing forest\r\ntrees. Yet it seems the Kaiser's forests were short on this valuable\r\ntimber, so they picked up all the procurable black walnut in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis set the New York State Conservation Commissioner thinking and last\r\nyear he advised farmers to propagate and cultivate the black walnut--a\r\nlittle late for the emergency; but better late than never, especially in\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\nOn my little farm near Lockport, N. Y., there is a large black walnut\r\ntree, perhaps 90 to 100 years old. It bears a nut of unusual size, of\r\nexcellent taste and good keeping qualities. This tree has produced as\r\nhigh as ten bushels of shucked nuts in a season. Twenty-two years ago,\r\nwhen the importance of growing native nut trees had impressed but few\r\npeople, I did have the good sense to plant several dozen nuts from the\r\n\"Niagara King Walnut.\" I must confess I gave the trees little attention,\r\nand a farm hand zealously cut down all but one of the black walnuts,\r\nmistaking them for sumac. The survivor last year bore about three\r\nbushels of nuts. Most interesting of all is the result of observations\r\nas to the product, and its bearing on the question of whether or not nut\r\ntrees will reproduce \"true to variety.\" The walnuts from the young tree\r\ndiffer in shape, being almost round, while the fruit of the parent tree\r\nis almost chestnut in form. But the flavor, thickness of shell and the\r\nkeeping qualities seem identical.\r\n\r\nSix years ago I started a small black walnut and butternut tree nursery\r\nfor home use and from it have set out about four hundred trees along the\r\nditches and fences on the farm. The early plantings have attained a\r\nheight of from 12 to 15 feet. If every farmer would do likewise, he\r\nwould make a considerable addition to the country's food supply, to say\r\nnothing of the value of the timber for coming generations when the\r\nfrees approach maturity. It has afforded me pleasure to send nut trees\r\nto friends in various counties of the state and we shall watch with\r\ninterest, the reports on their growth and development under the many\r\nvariations of soil and climate. The butternut in many parts of the\r\ncountry is rapidly disappearing. To save this beautiful tree with its\r\ndelicately flavored nuts, it will undoubtedly be necessary to take it\r\ninto extensive cultivation.\r\n\r\nAlthough apart from the subject perhaps, it may be interesting to refer\r\nto the application of forestry to a woodlot containing native nut trees.\r\nLike many farmers who regard every tree as just a tree, useful for\r\ntimber or fire wood, I found several years ago that indiscriminate\r\ncutting on my woodlot was destroying walnuts, along with the commoner\r\nspecies of the stand. My first step was to halt the cutting of all black\r\nwalnuts, hickories, butternuts, oaks and beeches on the seven-acre\r\nwoodlot. I took an inventory of these trees and found there were 160\r\nshagbark hickories from 10 to 25 years old, five butternuts about 20\r\nyears old, and four black walnuts about 25 years old. These, of course,\r\nwere not \"tolerant trees\" like the evergreens, and most of them were\r\nrapidly deteriorating from being overcrowded by more rapidly growing and\r\nless desirable neighbors. All _of_ them had been retarded in growth by\r\nthe crowded condition of the stand. Inaugurating a process of judicious\r\nthinning with a view to giving the nut trees the advantage, the result\r\nin a single season was surprising. Under the beneficent influence of\r\nample sun, air and root sustenance, the butternuts and black walnuts\r\nbore fine crops for the first time, in the season following the winter\r\nthinning process. The young hickories contented themselves with making\r\ntheir first annual growth in years. And, Oh joy of realized hopes, in\r\nthis the third season since letting the sun into the native nut grove,\r\nnearly all of the older shagbark hickories bore their first crops! And\r\nnow I have a nut plantation, that might have been ere this, burned up as\r\nfire-wood, at no expense whatever, since the thinning out process\r\nproduced a very welcome supply of fire wood in these days of high-priced\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nIn a recent bulletin of the United States Department of Agriculture,\r\n\"Value to Farm Families of Food, Fuel and use of House,\" there are some\r\nilluminating statistics on \"The Farmer's Income\" and \"The Farmer's\r\nLiving.\" It is stated that \"the total average of the three items of\r\nfood, fuel and use of the house for the 950 families (selected from all\r\nparts of the United States) is $642, and 66% of $424 of this is\r\nfurnished by the farm.\" The Seven Pomeroy Centennial. Trees in one year\r\nproduced a food product worth and actually sold for about $800 in one\r\nyear! The average annual production of those seven trees has been over\r\n$600 for the last ten years. And what about the labor involved in\r\nraising and harvesting the English walnut crop in question? Picking the\r\nnuts from the ground, children gladly doing it and earning five cents\r\nper basket.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley's undiscovered farm under the first twelve inches was a\r\ngold mine when turned up finally; Mr. Pinchot's farm on top rescued from\r\nflood and other devastations is worth more money than before. But how\r\nabout the strip of land along the roadside, an aggregate waste of at\r\nleast one per cent of the acreages of eastern farms? Well worth\r\nreclaiming, and no expensive ditching, irrigation and lumbering involved\r\nin the process either. In addition, credit must be given also to this\r\nenterprise for the value of ornamentation of the highways and their\r\nprotection from the elements all seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nAnd strange to relate, in the long list of items under the head of\r\n\"Classes of Food,\" given in the Federal Bulletin referred to, no mention\r\nis made of nut foods, either native or imported nut trees. Fruits,\r\nvegetables, meats, store groceries, everything is there but nuts.\r\n\r\n\"Nutty,\" do we hear someone suggest? Probably not in this audience of\r\nenlightened nut growers, but speaking to the general public we shall\r\nsay, \"Well, mebbe,\" like Uncle Lige of Niagara. Two bad years on the\r\nfarm, four acres of tomatoes that didn't pay for the plants, nothing but\r\nsoft corn and no potatoes compelled Uncle and Aunt Tompkins to open an\r\naccount at the corner grocery. The first month the bill came in, Aunt\r\nSally was all in a flutter when she audited the items: Sugar, 60;\r\ncoffee, 40; oatmeal, 50; sugar, 75; ditto, 80. \"Lige, you go right back\r\nto the store and tell that cunnin' clerk that he's charged us fer what\r\nwe never got. We ain't had no 'ditto' in this house.\" Lige went to the\r\nstore and returned, apparently a sadder but a wiser man. \"Well, Lige,\"\r\ninquired the thrifty spouse, \"Did you find out 'bout that 'ditto' we\r\ndidn't get? What did you find?\" Lige picked up his pipe, remarking,\r\n\"Well Sally, I found I was a durned fool, and you _ditto_.\"\r\n\r\nWe are all waking up to the fact that we did not become \"nutty\" soon\r\nenough. We have found that our public agencies of conservation have been\r\n\"durn fools\" and farmers and other land owners \"ditto\", for not having\r\ninaugurated the systematic planting of productive trees along the\r\nhighways and farm hedgerows and ditches, many years ago.\r\n\r\nNorman Pomeroy used to say with becoming modesty that he took no credit\r\nfor planting the trees that have made such a substantial income for his\r\nfamily, because \"I had to be slapped in the face in the dark before I\r\nbecame wise, and then the natural improvidence of mankind came near\r\nspoiling Nature's tip when the children gratified their little stomachs\r\nin preference to planting for the future. Men are but children of an\r\nolder growth, a wise man said. That is a true but sad doctrine. We all\r\nlive too much in the present and for the present, forgetting that the\r\nfuture will soon be the present, if not for ourselves, for our children\r\nand our children's children. It takes time to realize on trees, for the\r\nstomach or the pocketbook. It requires sacrifice to get anything worth\r\nwhile and, waiting is the hardest kind of sacrifice, especially for\r\npeople of small means. But it pays in the end.\"\r\n\r\nThe Northern Nut Growers' Association, is doing valuable work not only\r\nin the study and planting of nut trees, but in its propaganda. But I\r\nhave discovered that the results of practical work and the worth of\r\npropaganda, are hard to bring home to public agencies, like Governors\r\nand Legislatures. The construction and maintenance _of_ public highways\r\nare a state function. But that duty must be incomplete in our opinion\r\nuntil the state finishes its job by planting productive trees along the\r\nhighways and public roads. How shall we bring this about? Adopt\r\nresolutions? Very good.\r\n\r\nBut did the Anti-Saloon League, for example, content itself with\r\nresolutions when it wanted real results in the halls of legislation? Not\r\nmuch. Our prohibition friends were very practical. They employed trained\r\nagents to present their cause everywhere and in every way calculated to\r\ndo the most good.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat to you tree planters the late Norman Pomeroy's favorite\r\nlines, as I recall them:\r\n\r\n    \"_The dead are eternized in stone,_\r\n    _The living, by living shafts are known._\r\n    _Plant thou a tree and each recurring spring_\r\n    _The stirring leaves thy lasting praise shall sing._\"\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Prof. Chittenden, of Michigan Agricultural\r\nCollege will address you on \"Native Nut Tree Plantations for Michigan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIVE NUT TREE PLANTATIONS IN MICHIGAN\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR A. K. CHITTENDEN, MICHIGAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE EAST\r\nLANSING, MICHIGAN\r\n\r\nI am very glad of this opportunity to tell you what the Michigan\r\nAgricultural College is doing, and what it thinks, about nut tree\r\nplantations in this State. I want to say first, that there is a very\r\ngeneral interest in nut trees among the farmers and land owners of the\r\nState. A considerable number of the letters that the Forestry Department\r\nof the College receives from farmers are about nut culture. They seem to\r\nbe particularly interested in pecans, English walnuts, and chestnuts. A\r\nfew years ago the State was flooded with literature urging people to\r\nplant these trees and we are still feeling the aftermath of this\r\ncampaign. Much of this state is too far north for the successful growth\r\nof these particular trees and we therefore have advised waiting before\r\ninvesting heavily in young trees, until experiments have shown where\r\nthey would succeed and what kinds it would be safe to plant. At the same\r\ntime, we suggested the planting of one or two trees of certain varieties\r\nas an experiment. We have for the most part recommended only our native\r\nnut trees for planting on a large scale.\r\n\r\nWe have tried many varieties of nut trees, grafted on hardy stock, at\r\nthe College, and only a few of them are alive today. All of the pecan\r\ntrees have been lost and nearly all of the English walnuts. About two\r\nyears ago, we got some of Burbank's Royal walnuts from California. All\r\nof these trees except one, were killed back of the graft the first\r\nwinter. One of them, however, is doing well although growing very\r\nslowly. It will doubtless succeed now, as it has pulled through two\r\nwinters, one an exceptionally cold one.\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago, we bought some Sober Paragon chestnuts from an\r\neastern nursery which had been advertising them widely in this State.\r\nThey were all infected with the Chestnut Blight disease. Now this\r\ndisease has at the present time not appeared in Michigan, except on\r\nimported nursery stock. We have a considerable number of chestnut\r\nplantations in the State, and if the disease can be kept out, there is\r\nno reason why chestnuts cannot be raised more profitably. But our\r\nexperience has shown that the trees must be raised in this State and not\r\nbrought in from outside. We have some very nice chestnut trees in our\r\nnursery at the College which are now thirteen years old and which have\r\nbeen bearing nuts for four years. This fall we are planting them all\r\nalong the drives so as to open up the crowns and induce a greater\r\nproduction of nuts.\r\n\r\nWe also have some Japanese walnuts that are doing well indeed. One of\r\nthese trees on the campus is 35 years old and produces a large quantity\r\nof nuts.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of English walnuts at various places along Lake\r\nMichigan in the fruit belt. Individual trees will often succeed, but the\r\nchances for success are not great enough to warrant a man putting very\r\nmuch money into a plantation. There are two Sober Paragon chestnuts near\r\nNiles which are now 12 years old and are growing and bearing well. At\r\nthe College farm, near Grand Rapids, there are some pecan trees, but\r\ntheir history shows that they have been repeatedly frosted back.\r\n\r\nI could mention a great many cases of success with individual imported\r\ntrees, but I do not know of any extensive plantations that have so far\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a different story to tell of our native nut trees of\r\nwhich there are many successful plantations. Our native edible nuts are\r\nblack walnut, hickories and chestnut. They will grow anywhere in the\r\nsouthern part of the State and along Lake Michigan. Using these trees as\r\na basis, I believe we can develop, if it has not already been done, a\r\ntree that will bear an improved quality of nuts and that will be\r\nperfectly hardy.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut is the tree that did perhaps more than any other tree\r\nto help win the war, and, while timber raising and nut culture do not\r\nperhaps go hand in hand, probably more black walnuts are being planted\r\nas individual trees than any other tree in the State. The black walnut\r\nwas an invaluable tree for gun stocks and airplane propellers. The War\r\nDepartment scoured the country to find trees for these purposes and\r\nevery black walnut that is now planted, may be of service to the country\r\nin the future. The College raises thousands of black walnuts and\r\nJapanese walnuts each year, and the demand for them is very great. When\r\nwe have in planting, a choice between two trees, one choice being a tree\r\nsuitable for shade only and the other a nut producing tree, I would say\r\nplant the nut tree. Our trees will have a double appeal if they furnish\r\nnot only shade, but edible nuts as well. At the last session of the\r\nState Legislature, an act was passed providing for the planting of nut\r\nand shade trees along our highways. As a result of this act, we hope\r\nsometime to see the highways in the southern part of the State lined\r\nwith walnut and other nut bearing trees. A tree that will serve a\r\ndouble purpose should be planted wherever possible.\r\n\r\nTree planting is a thing in which we are all interested. Those of you\r\nwho have been abroad remember the long rows of trees, often fruit trees,\r\nthat lined the roads. In this country we cannot plant fruit trees along\r\nour roads as there is nobody to care for them and disease would quickly\r\nstart and spread to our orchards. But nut trees can be safely planted.\r\n\r\nWe have, on certain soils in the southern part of the State, recommended\r\nplanting black walnuts for fence posts. The heart wood is very durable\r\nand the tree grows quite rapidly under favorable conditions. Then,\r\nperhaps when the trees are large enough for posts, the owner will decide\r\nto keep them for the nuts and for timber production.\r\n\r\nDuring the past summer the College made a study of native nut tree\r\nplantations in the State with a view to determining the profitableness\r\nof such plantations.\r\n\r\nAmong the older plantations studied was one in Berrien County. It was\r\nplanted 45 years ago and covers four acres. The soil is clay and loam\r\nwith a clay sub-soil. Three year old seedlings were used with an average\r\nspacing of about 28 by 32 feet. The grove was cultivated for about 8\r\nyears after planting. The trees are now in fairly good condition but\r\nmany are affected with heart-rot. They are quite spreading and bushy in\r\nform and are not suitable for lumber. There is now about 30 cords of\r\nwood per acre. The average diameter is 20 inches with an average height\r\nof 60 feet. The ground is sodded over and the grove is used for grazing\r\nsheep. The owner says that about half the trees bear and that the June\r\nbugs are the principal source of trouble, eating the blossoms. The yield\r\nin nuts varies from practically nothing to 25 or 30 bushels for the\r\nentire plantation. About six years ago, the owner reports a crop of 36\r\nbushels, and two years ago a crop of 27 bushels. From these figures I\r\nshould say the plantation is a success.\r\n\r\nA chestnut plantation in Van Buren County was set 37 years ago and\r\ncovers one acre of sandy soil. The plantation was cultivated for about\r\nten years and corn was grown between the trees. The average tree is 14\r\ninches in diameter and 65 feet tall. The returns have been small because\r\nthe trees were planted too close together, but some years the plantation\r\nhas yielded 15 bushels of nuts. There are 67 trees on the acre, which is\r\ntoo many for good nut production. The grove will produce about 20 cords\r\nof wood or about 550 split fence posts per acre.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest plantations in the State is 56 years old and covers\r\n1-1/2 acres in Montcalm County. It consists of black walnuts and\r\nchestnuts mixed together. The average black walnut is 14 inches in\r\ndiameter and 67 feet tall. The average chestnut is 20 inches in diameter\r\nand 60 feet tall. The spacing is about 40 by 30 feet and the soil is a\r\ngravelly sand. The yield in nuts has been quite small, six to eight\r\nbushels a year.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of such mixed plantations in the State and it would\r\nseem that the two trees do not do very well together. In this case, I\r\nshould say that the soil is not well suited for either tree.\r\n\r\nThere is a plantation of Japanese walnuts in Oakland County. It is five\r\nyears old and on sandy soil. About 500 trees were planted at the cost of\r\n60 cents per tree. The stock came from Pennsylvania and was budded to\r\nEnglish walnut. The scions died back, however, and the plantation stock\r\ncame along so it is now a Japanese walnut grove. The average tree is\r\nabout 2 inches in diameter and 10 feet tall. The trees are very healthy\r\nand vigorous and are beginning to bear a few nuts.\r\n\r\nA chestnut plantation in Van Buren County is 12 years old. Two foot\r\ntransplants were used and the trees were planted at the rate of 100 to\r\nthe acre. They were cultivated for two years. The average tree is 4\r\ninches in diameter and 20 feet high. The trees are healthy and in good\r\ncondition. The grove is yielding from one to two bushels of nuts a year\r\nand should be thinned so as to open it up and encourage nut production.\r\n\r\nA black walnut plantation in Ingham County, planted about 20 years ago\r\nfor timber purposes and underplanted with white cedar to force the trees\r\nto grow straight and tall, is in excellent condition. The average tree\r\nis 5 inches in diameter and 34 feet tall. The plantation has not yet\r\nborne nuts but if it were opened up, would doubtless produce a large\r\nnumber in a few years.\r\n\r\nI could give more instances of nut tree plantations in the State, but I\r\nthink I have mentioned enough to show that our native nut trees can be\r\nprofitably raised. During the last few years, a great many black walnut\r\nplantations have been established but most of them are yet too young to\r\nbe in a bearing condition. If it were not for the difficulty of getting\r\nhealthy chestnut stock, I believe Michigan would be a large producer of\r\nthese nuts.\r\n\r\nA study has been made of the volume of the wood that could be obtained\r\nfrom these chestnut plantations. Owing to the open nature of the\r\ngroves, the trees are mostly not suitable for lumber and the yield of\r\ncordwood and posts is less than in a forest plantation where the trees\r\nare closer together and force each other to grow straight and tall. It\r\nwas found, however, that a chestnut grove planted for nuts, would yield\r\non the average 13 standard cords of wood per acre at 20 years of age, 20\r\ncords at 30 years, and 25 cords at 40 years of age. Placing the value of\r\nthis wood at present prices of $7 per cord, would give a value of $91\r\nper acre at 20 years and $140 per acre at 30 years for the wood alone.\r\n\r\nProbably most of the chestnut plantations have been planted for the nut\r\nand the black walnuts for timber with the nuts as a side issue.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts should be planted on fairly fertile, moist soil. We do not\r\nrecommend planting the nuts as squirrels are liable to dig them out. It\r\nis better to use small trees.\r\n\r\nThe cost of establishing black walnut plantations is quite small. Native\r\ntrees can be bought for $15 per thousand one year old seedlings. We\r\nprefer to plant these small trees as the black walnut develops a strong\r\ntap root early in life, making it difficult to transplant large trees.\r\n\r\nOnly a comparatively small number of hickories have been planted in this\r\nstate. This is a tree that, while it grows slowly, is very valuable for\r\nits wood and it is becoming very scarce. It should be planted more\r\nextensively. It may well be planted in openings in the woodlot. Every\r\nfarmer knows the value of hickory and the trees can be utilized when\r\nquite small.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say anything about the value of black walnut wood.\r\nHigh prices have been paid for standing trees and for saw logs. Many\r\nindividual trees have sold for $500 apiece and even more. Prices as high\r\nas $120 per M board feet have been paid for standing timber.\r\n\r\nAt the present rate of cutting, it is only a question of a few years\r\nbefore all of the merchantable black walnut will have been removed, and,\r\nunless trees are planted, the black walnut will be a thing of the past.\r\nIt cannot be depended upon to reproduce itself in our forests as do the\r\nmaples, the ash, and many other trees with nonedible seed. For every\r\nblack walnut tree in our woods and along the roads, there are\r\ninnumerable small boys and squirrels who are after the nuts and the seed\r\nhave little chance of germinating even if they do get into the soil. If\r\nthere are to be black walnuts in our future forests, the trees must be\r\nplanted or the nuts planted and properly safeguarded. From a forestry\r\nviewpoint, the black walnut is a good tree to plant. It has a high\r\nvalue and the demand for the wood is very great. And, for planting,\r\ntrees should be chosen that will give a good quality nut as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nFor ornamental planting, too, nut trees may often be chosen to\r\nadvantage. For the farm yard they are often the best choice. Hickories\r\nor black walnut are long lived trees and the hickory is very ornamental.\r\nA great many trees have been planted by the school children of the\r\nState; and right here is a good field for planting, around our school\r\nhouses. The average country school ground is a forlorn place, usually\r\nbarren of both grass and shade. While we perhaps cannot have a lawn, we\r\ncan certainly have shade trees, and the children will take care of them\r\nand watch their development with interest, particularly if they have a\r\npart in planting them. A few years ago the College distributed about\r\n6000 trees to the schools of the state for Arbor Day and many of these\r\ntrees were black walnuts. During the last few years, the Collage has not\r\nraised enough of these trees to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nAs memorial trees, also, nut trees are being quite extensively planted.\r\nA great many black walnuts have been planted in the honor of our\r\nsoldiers who gave their lives in the war and it is a very suitable tree\r\nto plant for this purpose.\r\n\r\nNow that our forests are becoming more scarce, we are beginning to\r\nappreciate more fully the value of their products. Nuts, extracts, maple\r\nsyrup and many minor products are obtained from our native trees. If man\r\ncould be surrounded with the right assortment of trees, he would need\r\nlittle else. He would have food in the nuts and fruit; fire wood and\r\nbuilding material in the stems, as well as paper and clothing from the\r\nwood pulp. He would have sugar from the sap, medicine from the bark, and\r\nhe would have wood distillates, turpentine and resin. He could live long\r\nand well on the products of our forests.\r\n\r\nOur forests are, however, disappearing. Our native nut trees are being\r\ncut off. Our sugar maple orchards are being put into farm land, and\r\nforest products are increasing rapidly in price. We have got to keep a\r\ncertain part of the country in forests in order to have the country\r\nprosperous, and to do this we must either plant trees or so manage the\r\nexisting forests that they will renew themselves naturally. In planting\r\ntrees, we should not overlook the by-products of the trees, nuts and\r\nsyrup and bark. These products are often the main crop in themselves\r\nand in any case, they will increase the receipts and make our forestry\r\nwork more profitable.\r\n\r\nThere are many acres in southern Michigan and along the Lake, that will\r\ngive larger returns from nut tree plantations than from any other\r\nsource. We want first to be sure that the trees are hardy to the\r\nlocality before we recommend them. I believe there is a very big future\r\nfor such plantations. The history of southern plantations has been one\r\nof remarkable success.\r\n\r\nWe must be particularly careful in advising the establishment of nut\r\ntree plantations. We ought to be particularly careful in not encouraging\r\npeople to buy trees that we are not sure will succeed. For every\r\nplantation that fails means a loss of money and an obstacle to future\r\nprogress. But every tree that succeeds means an advertisement for years\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nI do not see any reason why southern Michigan cannot raise many improved\r\nvarieties of black walnut and perhaps some other nut trees as well. Our\r\nstudy of native nut tree plantations this summer, shows that with proper\r\ncare they may be very profitable and we hope to see a great extension of\r\nsuch plantations in this State.\r\n\r\nPROF. CHITTENDEN: I would like to say that the College has been\r\nvery favorably impressed with the work that this Association has been\r\ndoing and the care that is used in recommending nut trees. It is a thing\r\nthe people need a lot of advice about. I thank you. (Applause).\r\n\r\nMR. J. F. JONES: I would like to ask if the pecans that were\r\ntender were northern or southern pecans.\r\n\r\nPROF. CHITTENDEN: We got them from a nursery in New York State\r\nand I could not say as to the source of the stock beyond that.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: Naturally the southern source is the cheapest tree.\r\n\r\nPROF. CHITTENDEN: We got the trees from a nursery that had been\r\nadvertising them very extensively in Michigan. It was about five years\r\nago, at a time when this State had been flooded with literature from\r\nthis nursery and other nurseries about particularly pecans and\r\nchestnuts. We were doubtful about the trees they were recommending, and\r\nwe got a considerable number and planted them out, but we took pretty\r\ngood care of them; but they all died in winter.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: It is a pity that people who do the most\r\nadvertising have to. Certain firms are not allowed to advertise in nut\r\njournals at all. I think the public ought to be made aware of that fact.\r\nIt is a pity too, because the ones who spend the largest amount of money\r\nin advertising are the ones of whom we ask the most questions.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Prof. Chittenden's paper, it is a very important matter to\r\nimpress upon children and others who are setting out trees the idea that\r\na tree is not able to care for itself as a rule. It is quite the\r\nexception for a tree set out by itself to thrive and enter into\r\ncompetition with other trees and bushes and shade, in the early years,\r\nand insects later. I suppose the number of ordinary trees including\r\nmaples that make their way to a successful old age would not represent\r\none in many hundred thousands that make a start in the sprouting seed.\r\nThat fact ought to be impressed on every school child who is setting out\r\na tree--he really should adopt that tree and make that its own child.\r\nAnd if you can inculcate the maternal and the paternal instinct along\r\nwith the setting out of from one to six children of these other\r\nchildren, you will then get trees on your roadsides and your waste\r\nlands, and without a great amount of difficulty. But you have got to go\r\nback to first principles there and realize that very few trees are able\r\nto succeed after they have been set out unless they receive a great deal\r\nof care subsequently. Those of us who give a great deal of attention to\r\ntrees, who pretend to care for our trees, will lose a percentage so\r\nlarge that I would hardly dare state what it probably is. Among the\r\nhundreds and thousands of trees I have set out, all from reputable\r\nnurserymen or raised by myself; I doubt if 25% are alive today, and I\r\nhave pretty good success too. This is not to discourage anyone; it is to\r\nencourage people, and they are to be encouraged by knowing the facts;\r\nand when all the final facts are known about the values of trees that\r\nare given proper attention, then people will be willing to give them\r\nthat degree of attention. Not until then are we to have success in\r\nfilling our waste lands with nut trees.\r\n\r\nProf. Chittenden brought up one point of a great deal of consequence. In\r\nany locality plant the species which belong to that locality. The\r\nspecies which, by natural selection and adaptation have fitted\r\nthemselves to the environment are, as a rule, the trees which will do\r\nbest in that locality. That is a principle I think which ought to be\r\nthoroughly well fixed in mind. One may experiment with any number of\r\ntrees from a distance, but the trees which naturally have adapted\r\nthemselves to a locality, the species which have done that are the\r\nspecies upon which we can expend our efforts to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of chestnut blight, we assume that the chestnut blight\r\nwill act like measles blight, scarlet fever blight, or any other\r\nepidemic. In other words, it is due to a microbe, it is due to a\r\npeculiar microbic group, a peculiar family group which happened to\r\nstart out in northern China on its invasion and got to this country\r\nwhere it found trees which were not resistant. The American and European\r\ntrees are not resistant. Wherever it has gone from northern China, from\r\nthe place where blight, the tree host and enemy grew up side by side,\r\nand represented the survival of the fittest; wherever it has gone away\r\nfrom the place where we have the survival of the fittest, at any rate as\r\na result of struggle, there it has found susceptible individuals that it\r\nhas destroyed. When a blight of any sort sets out, chestnut blight,\r\nmeasles, scarlet fever--any blight you please, you are talking natural\r\nhistory, you are taking biology, about an animal or a plant, about a\r\nmicrobe, a living thing. All of these living things run out of their\r\nvital energy in time. Each microbe runs out of its energy just as a\r\nbreed of horses or of strawberries runs out of its energy. All\r\nvarieties, varietal types, run out of their natural energy, so that it\r\nis simply a question of length of time before this family microbe or\r\nfamily group of this microbe will lose its energy. We do not know how\r\nmany years that will be. It may be a great many years, and by that time,\r\nour chestnuts may practically have disappeared. We can find here and\r\nthere a tree which resists better than others do, and we may find some\r\nwith enough resistance to be worthy of propagation as of that resistant\r\nkind. We know that several species resist the blight very well. I found\r\nfour species that resist the blight very well among six kinds I have\r\ntried out on my place. But some chestnuts bear so early and heavily that\r\nwe may afford to set them out, even in the presence of blight, trimming\r\nthem back and looking after them carefully: For instance, a number of\r\nSober Paragon chestnuts that I planted all died but one that is near the\r\nhouse. It bears so heavily that it is well worth while, and it simply\r\nmeans that one must give a great deal of attention to it. Some people\r\ncan afford even to set out the Paragon because of its high bearing\r\npower. I have a number of hybrids which resist the blight very well. The\r\ncross between the American chestnut and the Japanese, or between the\r\ncommon American chestnut and the chinquapins showed the resistance very\r\nlargely of the resistant parent. But curiously enough, the ones which\r\nlook most like the American chestnut also carry that parent's weakness\r\nin regard to blight, so that all of my hybrids between the American\r\nchestnut and the resistant kinds which look like the American chestnut\r\nand act like it also catch the same microbe for the most part. But one\r\nof the hybrids does not. No. 2 which I have given Mr. Jones, is very\r\nmuch like the American chestnut. It grows vigorously, acts like it, and\r\nlooks like it, and it has not blighted up to the ninth year of age,\r\nbeginning to bear about the fourth year. Most of those that are like the\r\nchinquapin or like the Chinese chestnut resist blight very well.\r\n\r\nAbout Japanese walnuts. If Prof. Chittenden has a large number of\r\nJapanese walnuts about the state, he may very well select one or two of\r\nthe very best and advise the owners to top work the others with the one\r\nor two which happen to be particularly good. Most of the Japanese\r\nwalnuts are small. Most of them are Siebold type instead of the heart\r\nnut variety, but a few very large ones will be found here and there and\r\nof high quality, and they graft almost as easily as peaches.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Persian walnuts. If there are a few trees here and there\r\nabout the state, we need not fear the question of introducing others\r\nbecause it is too far north. If you simply have one tree that is a good\r\none, that is enough, because you can graft over all sorts of black\r\nwalnuts, Japanese walnut and Persian walnut stocks with the one or two\r\ntrees which are known to be good in Michigan. One good tree in the state\r\nwhich is bearing good nuts of desirable qualities is enough. Graft all\r\nof your other walnuts back from it. And in setting out the native black\r\nwalnuts, chestnuts and the hickories of different species, it is\r\nimportant always to distinguish in regard to intention--whether they are\r\nto be for forest purposes or for nut purposes. That is not always clear\r\nin the minds of a number of people whom I have seen setting out groves\r\nof these trees. They talk about getting timber and nuts. You can not get\r\nboth profitably. I think people ought to be impressed with the fact that\r\nif they are setting out apple trees for timber they would set them five\r\nor six feet apart. If they are setting them out for apples, they would\r\nset them sixty feet apart. Precisely the same thing is true of nut\r\ntrees. (Applause).\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: I would like to ask Dr. Morris how he protects\r\ngrafts the first year. Grafts growing the first year are very tender,\r\nput in late, and they will often winter kill in the tree that is\r\nperfectly hardy otherwise.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Mr. Jones is quite right about that, and that is a\r\nmatter requiring more experience than I have at the present time. What I\r\nhave done in the way of protection fairly well is this: For instance, if\r\nI graft Persian walnut on black walnut and it makes a late start and\r\nthen in September has a very sappy growth, or in October has a sappy\r\ngrowth of three or four or five feet (they grow tremendously fast, like\r\nweeds) if the bark at the base of the graft is brown or has two or\r\nthree buds that are brown or partially ripened, I cut off four or five\r\nof the first leaves and let them harden. Then in the fall I cut off all\r\nbut those four or five buds and put wax over the end. That is the way I\r\navoid the winter killing of the sappy growth. As soon as the part\r\nnearest the grafted place begins to turn brown, looks like hardening up\r\nand two or three buds are pretty hard, I cut off four or five of those\r\nleaves right there and let the buds ripen, and those buds will ripen\r\nvery well. I will sacrifice five or six buds for the sake of saving\r\nthree or four buds. The next year they grow all right. That is not a\r\nnice way, but when you see you are going to lose a thing on account of\r\nsappiness, that will sometimes work.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: I generally wrap the base of the limb in burlap.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: If the sappy tip dies, it poisons the rest. There\r\nare poisonous enzymes that poison the rest of it.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I was going to ask Prof. Chittenden if he could give\r\nany experience with the named varieties of black walnuts.\r\n\r\nPROF. CHITTENDEN: I don't think I could distinguish between the\r\nvarieties of black walnut that have been planted in this state. That is\r\nnot a thing that I feel able to discuss. I know that a number of\r\ndifferent varieties of black walnut have been planted. At the College we\r\nhave done a good deal of grafting on the black walnuts, and we have not\r\nhad very good success.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I had in mind improved varieties of black walnut\r\ngrafted on the black walnut stock.\r\n\r\nPROF. CHITTENDEN: I don't think we have had any experience of\r\nthat. We always get a good deal of wood from Pennsylvania in the spring\r\nand do the grafting in class. We can not expect a very high grade of\r\nwork when the students do it as a part of their work of instruction.\r\nThere are some black walnuts in the state that have very good nuts, and\r\nsome that have not. I have tried to get for our nursery good nuts from\r\ntrees that had a good native nut. We have had so much difficulty getting\r\nblack walnuts at all the last few years that we have taken just what we\r\ncould get. We get nuts from all over the central part of the state and\r\nplant in the nursery to get our seedling trees.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I have found some of the named varieties of black\r\nwalnuts bearing in quite a number of sections of this state and other\r\nstates. They seem to bear quite young.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Mr. Jones has partly prepared a paper on\r\n\"Pecans other than those of the well known sections,\" but as it has\r\nbeen impossible to complete it, it will be handed to the secretary\r\nlater, and inserted in the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPECANS OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE WELL KNOWN SECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. F. JONES, LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\nPecans have been grown in the South for a good many years, and, with the\r\nadvent of budded and grafted trees of superior varieties in more recent\r\nyears, the industry made great strides and now that the product of some\r\nof these grafted orchards is coming on the market and selling readily at\r\nhigh prices, the economic value and importance of the pecan is becoming\r\nto be more fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe success of the pecan in the South, led some planters in the northern\r\nstates to make experimental plantings of these southern varieties but\r\nthey have proven disappointing, as might be expected, since our seasons\r\nare too short for the nuts to mature, even where the trees are hardy. I\r\nhave seen the Stuart, one of the largest southern pecans, when grown in\r\nLancaster and Adams Counties, Pa., not half as large as the Indiana\r\nsorts and with little or no kernel. The Schley, one of the finest\r\nsouthern pecans, when grown in Adams Co., Pa., is so small that no one\r\nwould recognize it and it has no kernel at all.\r\n\r\nIn very recent years, largely through the efforts of a few progressive\r\nmen in Indiana, fine varieties of the pecan have been discovered in\r\nIndiana and Kentucky, and these varieties are being propagated and\r\nplanted over the northern states generally. While the discovery of these\r\nvarieties and their propagation marked a big step forward in extending\r\nthe cultural range of the pecan and making it possible to grow this nut\r\nseveral hundred miles north of the southern pecan belt, not unlike the\r\nsouthern varieties, the Indiana and Kentucky varieties are necessarily\r\nlimited in their range of adaptability, and it is perhaps not safe to\r\nrecommend them for planting, except possibly in the more favored\r\nlocalities, north of the 40th parallel and south thereof and possibly in\r\nthe elevated or mountain sections they should not be recommended for\r\nplanting north of latitude 38 degrees. The advantages of securing\r\nvarieties for propagation therefore from as far north as possible is\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\nI have examined a good many sample pecans from Missouri and Kansas, some\r\nof which are excellent, but, aside from possibly being a little hardier\r\nin tree, they have no advantage over the fine Indiana and Kentucky\r\nvarieties that we already have, unless of course, they should be better\r\nadapted to planting in the western states.\r\n\r\nIn its natural range, the pecan is found growing farther north along the\r\nMississippi River, in Iowa and Illinois, than anywhere else in the\r\ncountry, and naturally we turned to these pecan forests hoping to find a\r\nvariety bearing nuts of a size and quality to merit propagation and\r\ndissemination north of the belt where it is safe to recommend the\r\nplanting of the Indiana varieties. As a result of correspondence with an\r\nIowa nurseryman in the fall of 1914, I engaged the services of a\r\ncompetent man to gather pecans for me at Muscatine, Iowa. Following my\r\ninstructions, this man searched the woods in that locality to find what\r\nI wanted for propagation and as a result, nuts were sent me from several\r\ntrees which were carefully marked so that in case scions were wanted\r\nfrom any of the trees, they would be readily identified. This man seemed\r\nto be very enthusiastic about the nuts he sent me, and, as he had made a\r\nbusiness of gathering pecans, and he knew the pecans in that section\r\nwell, I felt that he had sent me the best that he had there. None of the\r\npecans sent had sufficient size and merit to propagate however, and I\r\ngave the matter up. Fortunately, Mr. G. H. Corsan, Toronto, Canada, was\r\nendeavoring the same fall or winter to get pecans to grow trees that\r\nwould succeed in Canada and he bought pecans from a dealer in\r\nBurlington, Iowa. Upon receiving this lot of nuts, Mr. Corsan was\r\nastonished at their large size, as he expected that pecans from the\r\nnorthern limit of the pecan to be of small size. Thinking that this\r\nparty had sent him southern pecans, Mr. Corsan wrote him at once that he\r\ndid not want southern pecans, explaining that he wanted them for\r\nplanting. This party replied that the nuts sent him were genuine Iowa\r\npecans. Knowing my interest in the matter, Mr. Corsan wrote me during\r\nthe spring of 1915, giving me the facts in the case and urged that I go\r\nto Burlington the next fall and look up a variety for propagation. Fall\r\ncame on, but with it, so much to do and with short help, due to war\r\nconditions, that I had to give up the trip, but, at Mr. Corsan's\r\nsuggestion, I took the matter up with Mr. Ed. G. Marquardt, Burlington,\r\nIowa, with the result that the matter was placed in his hands, with the\r\nassurance from Mr. Marquardt that he would do the very best he could for\r\nus. Mr. Marquardt employed a man who had made a business of gathering\r\npecans there and who knew the trees bearing the largest nuts, and with\r\nthe help of this man, finally located a tree 20 miles north of\r\nBurlington bearing very large pecans of thin shell and splendid quality.\r\nAlthough most of the nuts had been gathered, the husks on the ground\r\nindicated it had been bearing good crops. This tree was marked and some\r\nof the nuts sent to me. These pecans I considered remarkably fine for so\r\nfar north. They were fully as large as the Indiana, with even a thinner\r\nshell and a full kernel of excellent quality. With the help of Mr.\r\nMarquardt, scions were secured from this tree the following spring, and\r\ngrafting proved very successful, which we consider very fortunate, as\r\nthis land was cleared during the war and this tree met the fate of\r\nothers, being turned into lumber and it is no more.\r\n\r\nThis variety has been given Mr. Marquardt's name. Coming from 20 miles\r\nnorth of Burlington, Iowa, in north latitude 41 degrees, I shall expect\r\nthe Marquardt to succeed any where south of the Great Lakes. The Indiana\r\nand Busseron pecans originated farther north than any others of the\r\nIndiana group, the original trees of which are growing in the Wabash\r\nRiver bottom, west of Oaktown, Ind., about 10 miles south of latitude\r\n39. Most of the Indiana and Kentucky varieties are from latitude 38\r\ndegrees, or approximately 200 miles south of where the Marquardt\r\noriginated. The climate of Iowa is also considerably colder than is the\r\nsame latitude farther east, due to the more open character of the\r\ncountry west and to the influence of the Great Lakes farther east. The\r\npecans there are not only necessarily hardier, but have to mature their\r\nfruit in a shorter season, which is all important in a variety for\r\nnorthern planting, as it has been shown that the pecan is hardy in tree\r\nconsiderably north of where it will mature its fruit properly. Realizing\r\nthe importance of the Iowa pecans for northern planting and realizing\r\nthe building of the big power dam on the Mississippi River at Keokuk,\r\nIowa, and the consequent raising of the water level for considerable\r\ndistance up the river together with building of levees and clearing of\r\nthe forests, threatened the destruction of many of the pecan trees and\r\npecan forests, Mr. Bixby spent nearly a week during the past fall in the\r\npecan forests and groves along the Mississippi River around Clinton,\r\nIa., and Burlington, Ia. The facts of the following paragraphs (except\r\nthe last two) I have taken from his notes:\r\n\r\nThese pecan trees at Clinton, Iowa, are the most northerly growing of\r\nthe native pecans so far discovered. They are on the islands in the\r\nriver and on the bottom lands, where the land at low water is only a few\r\nfeet above the water level, and at high water, several feet under water.\r\nThe trees certainly are not suffering from lack of moisture. The soil is\r\nalluvial, seemingly of unknown depths and must be very fertile,\r\nenriched as it is by the deposits left by the high waters each year, or\r\nsometimes, several times a year. No pecan trees under six inches in\r\ndiameter were seen here, and they ranged from that size up to 24 inches\r\nin trunk diameter 85 feet tall. No trees bearing large pecan nuts were\r\nseen, although the flavor of the kernels of practically all of the trees\r\nwas good. Crops of nuts were irregular and seemingly not so good as they\r\nwere some years. None of the trees near Clinton were deemed worthy of\r\npropagation.\r\n\r\nThe pecans at Burlington are growing under similar conditions to those\r\nat Clinton, but they are much more numerous, there being thousands of\r\nthem, some being larger than any seen at Clinton. Four trees, including\r\nthe Marquardt, have been discovered and brought to the attention of the\r\nassociation by Mr. Ed. G. Marquardt and Mr. John H. Witte of Burlington.\r\nCuts of these nuts, natural size, are shown opposite page 48. The\r\nMarquardt is being propagated by me and the other three varieties by\r\nSnyder Bros., Center Point, Iowa.\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of the leaves, buds and habit of growth of the\r\nMarquardt pecan, it seemed to me that the tree had hickory blood in it,\r\nalthough the nut did not suggest it; and I intended to look into this\r\nmatter fully, on a trip to Iowa the past fall, but finding I could not\r\ngo, I gave Mr. Bixby samples of the nuts, leaves and twigs and told him\r\nwhat I expected, and he had this in mind during his trip. He never found\r\nyoung pecan trees growing in the woods but did find them growing in\r\nlarge numbers on the levees and on the edges of cultivated fields. A\r\ncareful examination showed a very considerable variation in leaf, bud\r\nand habit of growth and there seemed little question but that there were\r\namong them many hybrids between the pecan and the big bottom shellbark,\r\n_Carya laciniosa_, which is found growing on the bottom lands and the\r\nislands along with the pecan. As a matter of fact, two of the four Iowa\r\npecans selected for propagation, the Burlington and the Greenbay, show\r\nunmistakable evidence of hybrid parentage in the nut, in the leaves and\r\nbuds. The Marquardt gives no hint of such parentage in the nut, but the\r\nleaves and buds do suggest that it has hickory blood in its make up, and\r\nit is believed that this is so. The Witte is seemingly a pure pecan.\r\n\r\nThere has recently been much done near Burlington in reclaiming\r\nvaluable, cultivatable lands from the river which formerly overflowed\r\nthem each year so that people were afraid to plant crops and they were\r\ntherefore abandoned to the forests. Levees have recently been built to\r\nkeep the water off these lands in time of high water. Drainage ditches\r\nhave been made behind them and pumping plants put in to pump the water\r\nout of them. The cost of these improvements, which has given to\r\ncultivation much very fertile land, has been assessed on the owners of\r\nthe lands benefited, as is also the upkeep expense. Many owners had not\r\nthe money to pay the assessments and have sold the land to those who are\r\nclearing off the timber. This means the clearing of thousands of acres\r\nof bottom land and the pecan is one of the principle trees on these\r\nbottom lands. This condition makes it necessary to locate and propagate\r\nat once, the best and most promising of these Iowa pecans and hybrids\r\nand observe their behavior afterwards in the young trees, instead of\r\ndepending on the watching of the behavior of the original trees as has\r\nbeen the case in Indiana.\r\n\r\nI feel reluctant to close this address without mentioning the good work\r\ndone by Secretaries Deming and Bixby and other members of this\r\nAssociation in searching for varieties of nuts that may be superior to\r\nwhat we already have. Those of us who are propagating these trees, while\r\nwe may feel the inspiration that comes from doing a work that benefits\r\nmankind, nevertheless, we hope and expect to make dollars and cents out\r\nof growing these trees, while this is not the case with some of the\r\nmembers of this Association who are not nurserymen and who do not expect\r\nto enter this field.\r\n\r\nDr. Deming, former Secretary of this Association, did much good work and\r\nsecured some fine nuts worthy of propagation, through advertising and\r\nthe offering of premiums, and Mr. Bixby, who very kindly took up this\r\nwork when Dr. Deming was called to the colors, has been active and is\r\ndoing a great work for northern nut culture.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: We will now have a grafting demonstration by\r\nMr. Jones.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones had brought with him specimens of stock, scions and all the\r\nmaterials and tools needed for the demonstration, and performed the\r\nvarious operations of grafting and budding before the audience.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: We often use scions half or three-fourths of an inch\r\nin diameter, for grafting, but they are rather hard to get. In top\r\nworking, we generally take limbs two to four inches in diameter, cut\r\nthem off, and split the bark. The nut grafting must all be done late\r\nwhen the sap is up in the trees. Cut the scions all on one side. Split\r\nthe bark, slip in the scion, tie up and wax the whole scion over with\r\ngrafting wax, put it on hot and seal it up tight. Sometimes for winter\r\nprotection of the English walnut as far north as Michigan your tip might\r\nkill back because it grows so very fast and is sappy. I have never\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PECANS FROM BURLINGTON, IA]\r\n\r\nhad trees kill in that way, but I do have many people write me that they\r\nhave trees killed in that way. In nursery grafting, we usually use just\r\nthe cleft method. You should cut the cleft on one side and don't split\r\nit, but keep it smooth all the way through.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: You get better results, Mr. Jones, from waxing\r\nthe entire scion?\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: Yes, we get better results that way. In the South we\r\nhave no success at all that way; we have to cover them with sacks.\r\n\r\nVOICE: About what degree of heat is best for the wax?\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: Don't have it too hot and it can't burn. You can\r\ntell that by the wax smoking.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: As long as the wax does not smoke, it is pretty\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: This illustrates what we call a side graft. Put the\r\nscion in the side and leave the top on. You can also do it in bark\r\ngrafting. Cut your bark, split it, and stick your scion straight down as\r\nit is here.\r\n\r\nVOICE: How do you apply the hot wax?\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: With a swab or brush. We use a carbon heater and\r\nthat makes it about the right temperature.\r\n\r\nVOICE: How large black walnut trees could be top worked to\r\nEnglish walnuts?\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: You can work almost any sized tree, but it is quite\r\na job in the large tree. Take a tree larger than six inches in diameter,\r\nor eight, and it would not be very satisfactory. In cutting the scions\r\nbe careful to make a straight surface on the cut bevel. To do that the\r\nknife should be held at an angle lengthwise to the scion. In our\r\ngrafting in the South we leave the scion dry and cover it with a bag.\r\nThat was in Florida.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: That is a very interesting question about the\r\nlimits of our using the method of covering the scion and all with the\r\nwax. I shall speak of that in my own grafting demonstration which is\r\nshort. I got the point from Mr. Jones, and Mr. Jones tells me he got it\r\nfrom Mr. Riehl. They use black wax and hard, strong wax.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: Mr. Riehl uses a liquid wax, resin and beeswax\r\nwithout the coloring matter. We use the coloring matter to toughen the\r\nwax.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Still, that is amber. Amber will cut out light, and\r\nit seems to me that it is a matter of a good deal of consequence, the\r\nblack or amber wax covering the graft completely, buds and all, wound,\r\nscion, stock. It succeeds in the North, succeeds better than any other\r\nmethod in grafting, and yet in the South it does not succeed. It is\r\npossible that as you get further south the longer sun, the hotter sun\r\nscalds the cambium layer of bark beneath when it would not do so in the\r\nNorth. That is at least worth thinking about. In my own work during the\r\npast year I have used transparent paraffin alone, nothing else. I have\r\ntried different kinds of paraffin, the Parowax, the common one that the\r\nwomen put up preserves with is the one that will stay on best, will not\r\ncrack and is perfectly transparent, allowing the light of the sun to act\r\nupon the chlorophyl, in the bark and the bud and intensify the activity\r\nof that part of the plant that depends upon light transformation by\r\nmeans of chlorophyl. I am very much interested to know if this will not\r\nsucceed in the South. Paraffin would not attract the heat of the sun,\r\nand it is possible that this will allow us to carry the method of Mr.\r\nJones, the best method to date, still farther south.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: I think, Doctor, it is a matter of heat, because in\r\nthe shade you can graft them almost any way. Do you cover the scion with\r\nparaffin or only the union?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: I cover the entire thing with paraffin, scions,\r\nbuds and all including the wrapping. I don't leave anything exposed to\r\nthe air. There are several principles involved there. In the first place\r\nyou have the effect of light upon chlorophyl which is important; in the\r\nsecond place, the melted paraffin fills all interstices in which sap\r\nwould collect and ferment. If those interstices are filled with melted\r\nparaffin, sap will not collect there and ferment. The microbes of\r\nbacterial and fungus origin, that prevent union and break down the\r\nproducts of repair that are thrown out for the purpose of repair, can\r\nnot do it if they can not collect in quantity, and the paraffin fills\r\nthe space in which they would collect in quantity; so that does away\r\nwith another one of the dangers. In the third place, you have the same\r\nsap tension maintained in the scion as in the stock. The difference\r\nbetween the negative and positive pressures, day and night, is very\r\ngreat in spring time, and as the sap responds between day and night in\r\nthe stock, it puts a strain upon the scion. The scion can not follow the\r\nstock with its sap movement ordinarily. But if scion and stock are\r\ncovered completely with paraffin, the tension remains the same, so that\r\nyou do away with the shock of varying negative and positive pressures.\r\nThat is an important point, it seems to me, in principle in the matter\r\nof using the paraffin. Another point is this. You prevent evaporation\r\nfrom scion that goes on ordinarily through the little breathing\r\nlenticels, the little apertures between the cells of the bark which\r\nallow moisture to escape as well as to enter. One would naturally\r\nbelieve the paraffin would fill these and smother the scion, and I\r\npresume it is that fear which has prevented the world from trying this\r\nfor the past ten thousand years, because they were skilful grafters in\r\nEgypt, both in the tree world and the financial world, in the days of\r\nHammurabi there were skilful grafters in both worlds two or three\r\nthousand years before Christ. I suppose that fear of closing the\r\nbreathing apertures in the stock has prevented people from adopting this\r\nmethod; but it is not justified, because those bold, brave nurserymen\r\nwho are not afraid to smother a scion find that all the scions live. It\r\nis a venture into the unknown, that dramatic book, in the way of\r\ndramatically constructive progress. Another point: When you protect your\r\ngraft in the ordinary way with ordinary wrapping, ordinary wax, the\r\nscion becomes timid, the stock becomes timid. It is not quite sure of\r\nitself in many cases, and when it is not sure of itself, when it has a\r\nfear, what does it do? It resorts to the protection method. What is the\r\nfirst? Suberization, cork layer formation. So the frightened stock\r\nthrows cork cells over its cut surface between that and the graft, and\r\nthe suberization goes on as a result of fear on the part of the timid\r\nstock. When you have taken away the fear by covering the whole area with\r\nmelted paraffin and it feels safe, then suberization does not go on in\r\nthis way, your stock is not frightened, you have not a scared tree at\r\nall, and it will go on kindly and gently as a Jersey heifer to do its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I would like to ask Dr. Morris about that\r\nmyself. I am very much interested in the line of grafting, as we graft\r\n50,000 to 100,000 every spring, using this same method. I feel as Mr.\r\nJones does, that the losses from grafting are largely due to heat and\r\nthe fermentation of sap. We find perhaps, that the first week of\r\ngrafting in cherry, we can almost invariably secure a fairly good stand.\r\nFollowing that it tapers as the warmth and air increase, although the\r\nscions are kept in cold storage, perfectly dormant, the sap is coming\r\nup, and the increased rays of the sun--we get a very small percentage,\r\nand it seems to become less every day, and we have always used the dark\r\nwax. While I have been using paraffin wax a good deal of the time, I put\r\nlampblack in it for coloring.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: I have until this year. In order to get Mr. Jones'\r\npoints, I tried to work out the philosophy of the subject and see what\r\nvalues there are, what meanings in the methods which led to his success.\r\nThen following that line of investigation, I stopped into another line\r\nof observation, and arrived at the transparent paraffin method, so that\r\nthis is the first year in which I have tried it, but the results are\r\nperfectly remarkable. I have only done it for a year, but you will see\r\n100% of catches on almost everything, hickories, walnuts, hazels. I must\r\ntell you of one very remarkable incident. Mrs. Morris had some dwarf\r\ntrees set out on the slope of the lawn, dwarf pear trees. One of my men\r\ncut one of them off with a lawn mower the latter part of August. The top\r\nkicked around under foot for three or four days, wilted in the sun. We\r\nwere walking past it along in August. I think Mr. Bixby said, \"Why don't\r\nyou try grafting on that kind of material?\" I said, \"I will, blessed if\r\nI don't.\" So I cut three pear scions from this wilted top that had been\r\ncut by the lawnmower in August, and I put them on a scrub pear tree\r\nunder the fence near the house. And I tried this paraffin method, and in\r\nabout six days one of them started out a shoot, and I said to one of my\r\nmen, \"We will transplant this. This is no place for it.\" I meant in the\r\nspring, or in a year or so. He transplanted it the next day. And it grew\r\nI think about half an inch after that, made good wood to last through\r\nthe winter. So I don't know what the limitations of this paraffin method\r\nare. But that is a thing I would hardly dare tell about unless there\r\nwere men here in this room who had seen it. That little pear top, cut\r\noff by mistake, kicked about under foot a few days in August, no sort of\r\nscion that any one would ever think of using as a graft, put it in as a\r\njoke, and with the further abuse of being transplanted; but it started\r\ngrowth, and now it is going to be a good pear tree.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: The kicking around only made it good for grafting.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Perhaps it ripened up to a certain extent by\r\nthat drying out, like it would in the fall.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Maybe, but I have never heard of horticulturists\r\npropagating trees in that way and transplanting them in the same year,\r\nand having the new wood from the graft harden for the winter.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: Mr. Reed spoke of grafting a cherry. You cut the top\r\noff didn't you?\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Yes.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: We graft filberts by leaving the top on and cut the\r\ngraft in on the side and wax it over. We leave it there two weeks,\r\nmaybe, and cut it off, and we get perfect stands that way, and you would\r\non the cherry.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: We use the side grafting, but we cut the top\r\noff.\r\n\r\nMR. VOLLERTSEN: I would like to ask Dr. Morris with regard to\r\nthe stock. Don't you think the fact that that tree was moved at the time\r\nit was, so soon after grafting, had something to do with the retarding\r\nof the sap and causing the tree to mature the wood it did in place of\r\nmaking more growth?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: That might be. All of the expert horticultural\r\nopinions brought to bear on this are valuable. Every suggestion that has\r\nbeen made has had a meaning. It requires explanation.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: If there is nothing further along that line, we\r\nhave with us Mr. Conrad Vollertsen, of Rochester, who has been asked to\r\nprepare a paper; and we would like to hear from him. He is an expert in\r\nthe filbert, and I believe can give us some valuable information.\r\n(Applause).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZEL NUTS AND FILBERTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCONRAD VOLLERTSEN, ROCHESTER, N. Y.\r\n\r\nMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of this Convention: I have been\r\napproached by a member of the Northern Nut Growers' Association to\r\nprepare a paper to be read at this convention on the growing,\r\ncultivating, and propagating of the European hazel, together with such\r\nother topics on the subject, as would be of interest to the members of\r\nthis association, particularly my experience and observations during the\r\nlast three or four seasons in my hazel orchard and nursery.\r\n\r\nNow, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am not a public speaker nor a public\r\nwriter; my business is nursery and garden work; I can use spade and pick\r\nmore freely than pen and ink, and, therefore, fear that I am not the\r\nright party called upon, knowing as I do, that we have members in this\r\nassociation far more capable and experienced, and who possess more\r\nknowledge about the European hazel than ever I had. Nevertheless as the\r\ngrowing and planting of the European hazel in the eastern and middle\r\nstates of our country so far, both for ornamental or commercial\r\npurposes, has been more or less experimental, I think all practical\r\ninformation on the subject should be welcomed, and therefore I have\r\nconsented to prepare this paper and hope it will be accepted for what it\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nA number of years ago, after leaving school, I entered a large nursery\r\nand garden establishment in Germany, as an apprentice boy, to learn the\r\ngarden business, to become a gardener and horticulturist, to learn how\r\nto raise trees and other plants, to learn how to graft, to prune and\r\ncultivate, and, in general, to take care of all kinds of growing plants.\r\nOne of the first duties bestowed upon me in my new place was the charge\r\nof a large plot of young hazel or filbert plants. To prune or graft\r\nthem? Not at all. At that time I did not know anything about such\r\nskilled labor. I was merely told to weed and hoe them and to keep them\r\nclean. It was not just very elegant work, but, ladies and gentlemen, I\r\nenjoyed very much indeed, every minute so employed among those young\r\nfilbert bushes. I became really attached to them and knew practically\r\nevery plant in the plot, and almost believe they knew me, too.\r\n\r\nNow what was the reason for this immense pleasure I found in working\r\namong those plants? Was it perhaps from the commercial or financial\r\npoint of view, the future income from them for fruit or when the plants\r\nreached a saleable age? Not at all. I was then too much of a boy and did\r\nnot comprehend such a thing as that. It was merely the fond and pleasant\r\nrecollection of my childhood, of my boyhood, when, together with other\r\nchildren, in the proper season, we went hunting for the common hazel\r\nnuts, the _Corylus avellana_, as the gathering of these nuts is one of\r\nthe greatest pleasures of the German country child, and to roam through\r\nfields and woods in late summer in those beautiful September days, when\r\nthe foliage of trees and bushes begin to color, when the birds of the\r\ngarden, field and forest begin to assemble for future migration, when\r\ngoldenrod, asters and other field flowers are reaching their greatest\r\nbeauty, then, ladies and gentlemen, the hazelnut has reached maturity.\r\nThe nut itself is a very beautiful brown color, the outer bark a golden\r\nyellow, the leaves of the plants slightly colored with bronze, pink or\r\nyellow, a most beautiful combination, a pleasure to look upon, and a\r\nsight never to be forgotten. Whoever has had an opportunity to see and\r\nadmire a well fruited hazel plant, at the time of maturity, will agree\r\nwith me that it is a thing of beauty, not only during the fruit bearing\r\nseason, but in fact throughout the whole winter, with the handsome\r\nstaminate flowers or catkins appearing very abundantly in early fall,\r\nand remaining throughout the winter, until late spring. Of all these\r\npleasures, these beautiful sights, etc., of which a vivid and fond\r\nrecollection caused all the pleasures in cultivating the above mentioned\r\nhazel lot, we need not be deprived in our otherwise so richly blest\r\ncountry. It is true that, at the present time, we have no American\r\nnative hazel, that can fully compete with the better European varieties,\r\nbut we hope that in time not far off, through scientific hybridization,\r\nsuch will be produced. For the time being, we have some very fine\r\nEuropean varieties as a substitute, which for years have stood the test\r\nvery well, and should be planted wherever a place can be spared for a\r\nfew of them, and great pleasure and enjoyment will be the result. So\r\nmuch for the pleasure of raising hazel nuts. I have related the\r\nforegoing merely to show the lasting pleasure and enjoyments derived\r\nfrom the planting, cultivating and gathering of a few European hazel\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\nBut to raise hazel nuts for the pleasure of it only, would be a very\r\npoor business proposition, and certainly not a paying one. What we\r\nshould do is to raise them in large quantities, for commercial purposes,\r\nbut here it seems to me the question should be asked: Have we had\r\nexperience enough as to recommend the planting of them in the middle and\r\neastern states for commercial purposes? In other words, is it worth\r\nwhile to plant them with that point in view? Now, gentlemen, I do not\r\nsuppose that any one of us, at the present time, would be fully capable\r\nor prepared to answer this question intelligently or positively, as the\r\nplanting of the hazel, for commercial purposes, has not been tried long\r\nenough, at least not in the eastern or middle states, to warrant a\r\npositive opinion on the subject. A great deal depends upon the variety\r\nplanted, also the location where the planting is done. Much observation\r\nand experimenting is still required.\r\n\r\nI have growing on my ground in western New York, near Rochester, several\r\nhundred trees or bushes, 6 to 8 years old, about 20 varieties, most of\r\nthem German varieties, a few from France, and a few from England. They\r\nhave been bearing nuts the last four seasons, and all have reached\r\nmaturity perfectly. The smaller and medium sized nuts appeared to bear a\r\nlittle better than the larger varieties. The varieties received from\r\nFrance have, so far, not done well with me, as the German varieties.\r\nThey are poor bearers. In the fall of 1917, I gathered from each 5 to 6\r\nyear old tree, of the German variety, about a pound and a quarter of the\r\nmedium sized nuts, while hardly a pound from the larger fruited\r\nvarieties (same sized plants) ripened well. I was then under the\r\nimpression that the hazel not only could but should be planted in large\r\nnumbers for commercial purpose. In the fall of 1918 my crop of nuts was\r\nvery much less, and I had expected even a better harvest than in 1917,\r\nwhich certainly was discouraging to me. The plants themselves were\r\ngrowing beautifully, but most of the staminate blossoms or catkins were\r\nfrozen, and, consequently, very little pollenizing was accomplished, and\r\nvery little fruit the result. Such and possibly other occurrences, from\r\ntime to time we may expect and look for, and should be ready to\r\ninvestigate thoroughly, before we can advocate or recommend the planting\r\nof the hazel extensively.\r\n\r\nIt really seems strange that while the hazel generally is at home in the\r\nnorthern latitudes, it should partly freeze when the thermometer reaches\r\nsay about 12 to 18 degrees below zero, and, as I had never noticed that\r\nbefore, it then occurred to me that possibly another reason could be\r\nfound, why so many of the catkins were frozen.\r\n\r\nThrough my investigation in the spring of 1918, I have come to the\r\nconclusion that the unusually wet season in our vicinity of western New\r\nYork throughout 1917 caused the hazel plants to grow until the real cold\r\nweather was upon them, which gave the wood a very poor chance to ripen,\r\nparticularly the terminal buds, where a great many of the catkins had\r\nformed, and caused not only them to freeze but also a certain part of\r\nthe wood. Only the lower and more protected catkins came through the\r\nwinter alright and caused what little pollenizing was done, hence the\r\nvery light harvest in the fall of 1918.\r\n\r\nShould the results of my investigation prove true, and the continuance\r\nof the wet weather prove the main cause of freezing so many catkins,\r\nthen it seems to me there is nothing to be alarmed about, and the\r\nplanting of the European hazel, at least in this vicinity, for\r\ncommercial purposes could be conscientiously recommended, and should be\r\ndone, the sooner the better. We do not expect our apple or pear orchards\r\nto bear an abundant crop every year, and we should not expect it of our\r\nhazel orchards. Something will occasionally happen to them as well as to\r\nother crops, otherwise we run no risk whatever.\r\n\r\nMy trees or bushes, several hundred in number, planted in 1912 and\r\nlater, have stood all kinds of weather, extreme cold, very hot,\r\ncontinuous wet, and still are growing most beautifully at the present\r\ntime. They gave a very satisfactory crop of nuts this last fall, 1919,\r\nin spite of severe freezing weather on April 25th and 26th when the\r\nmercury dropped to 12 to 15 degrees, and all hazel bushes in full bloom.\r\nAt the present time the prospect for a good crop of nuts next season is\r\ncertainly very bright.\r\n\r\nNeither fungus, blight, or other diseases of any kind, or troublesome\r\ninsects have so far been detected. In planting the hazel for commercial\r\npurposes, I should recommend 12 feet distance between the plants each\r\nway, as they require abundant sun and air. At the same time, there is an\r\nopportunity to use the land between the rows for several years to come,\r\nas low growing crops like potatoes, strawberries, beans, beets, carrots,\r\netc., could be grown there to great advantage, and the cultivation of\r\nthese crops would be amply sufficient for the hazel plants.\r\n\r\nNow the selection of varieties to be planted for the commercial hazel\r\norchard is a very important part of the undertaking, and should be well\r\nconsidered. To plant several varieties is absolutely necessary on\r\naccount of pollenizing, as staminate and pistillate flowers, though on\r\nthe same plant, do not always appear together in proper condition on all\r\nplants; in fact it has been proven in my orchard that sometimes plants\r\nbring forth a great many pistillate blossoms and not a single staminate\r\none on them, and still a good crop of nuts were grown on them. Here the\r\npollination must have taken place with the pollen from other nearby\r\nplants conveyed to them by wind or insects. One particular plant of the\r\nzellernut type grown in one of my city lots during the last season was\r\nvery well filled with pistillate blossoms and not one catkin on it, and\r\nstill it ripened a fairly good crop of perfect nuts, where the nearest\r\nplants filled with staminate blossoms was at least 30 feet from it. Here\r\nit is shown and proven that a number of varieties is a necessity.\r\n\r\nBut what varieties we shall choose, will undoubtedly be an open question\r\nfor some time to come, and, no doubt, a great deal of experimental work\r\nwill have to be done to finally select the right varieties for the\r\ndifferent localities, the variation of temperature and location has very\r\nmuch to do with the proper selection of varieties. I have among my\r\nvarieties some I could recommend and again others that are not at all\r\nsatisfactory, at least not so far, and it requires more close\r\nobservation before the very best of them can be picked out or selected.\r\n\r\nOur next operation in the hazel will be the pruning. Here I should say\r\nabove all things: \"_Keep the suckers away._\" Hazel bushes are naturally\r\ninclined to produce a great many suckers, which should be thoroughly\r\nremoved as soon as they appear; it will stop when the plants grow older.\r\nBesides the suckers, all weak and unnecessary wood should be removed\r\nentirely, not cut back. Our aim should be to try and get as near as\r\npossible low standard trees, with trunk say 10 to 15 inches high and the\r\ntree itself not to exceed 15 to 18 feet in height with the center kept\r\nopen all the time. To accomplish this, I should suggest the removing of\r\nall crowding limbs from the center, regardless of their being\r\nfruit-bearing limbs, which to determine is mostly guess-work at the\r\nbest. In order to keep the plants within 15 to 18 feet in height, the\r\nterminal shoots also should be removed or reduced as the case may be,\r\nbeginning at the time of planting until the desired height is reached.\r\nAfter that, one or more of the old limbs may from time to time be\r\nremoved, as there always will be enough young branches to take their\r\nplaces. Such pruning in my orchard, so far, has proved sufficient, as\r\nblight has never made its appearance in my nursery.\r\n\r\nI will not be able to say much about blight. I have known trees in our\r\ncity, 4 or 5 varieties, for more than 30 years, bearing more or less\r\nfruit year after year, and have never noticed any blight or anything\r\nwrong with them. Should blight appear, I should remove all affected\r\nlimbs to the sound and healthy wood, as we would do to our pear and\r\nquince trees when blight appears among them. I do not believe that\r\nproperly treated hazel bushes will ever suffer much from blight, at\r\nleast not in our vicinity. Neither do I believe that any more pruning\r\nthan I have outlined is required or necessary to our hazel plants.\r\n\r\nThe next subject about which I wish to say a few words is the\r\npropagation of hazel plants. There seems to be quite a difference of\r\nopinion as to the mode of propagating them; some advocate grafting,\r\nothers layering, again others from suckers only. Grafting I believe\r\nmyself, will produce a finer plant and the operation of doing so seems\r\nquite successful, but a great many varieties produce so many suckers\r\nthat the graft is liable to be choked or crowded out if not constantly\r\nwatched, and it should not be expected of the average person to know the\r\ndifference between the graft and the wild shoot, and consequently, in a\r\ncomparative short time, he would have a wild or common hazel. For that\r\nreason grafted plants should not be used for the trade until our people\r\nget better acquainted with hazel plants. I, therefore, should recommend\r\nlayering, thereby having the plants on their own roots, which would\r\nprove more satisfactory everywhere. That grafted plants bear fruit\r\nsooner than layers, does not always hold good; it may be so with some\r\nvarieties, but not with all of them. I have some three year old grafted\r\nplants and no fruit as yet, where I had plenty of layers in the nursery\r\nrows two years old well fruited.\r\n\r\nIt is true that plants grafted on seedlings of the _Corylus avellana_\r\nwill not produce as many suckers, as plants grafted on layers of the\r\navellana type, but they will produce enough to confuse the average\r\nperson, as the foliage of some varieties are so nearly alike, that it\r\nactually requires an expert to tell the difference. I, therefore, under\r\nthe existing circumstances, should advise the propagating of hazel\r\nplants by layers only, until our people get better acquainted with the\r\nhazel proposition in general. Why propagation by suckers only should be\r\npreferred by some people, I fail to see, as they are practically the\r\nsame as layers, plants on their own roots from a parent plant, only that\r\nlayers are produced a little more scientifically and suckers more\r\nnaturally; otherwise they are identically the same thing.\r\n\r\nWhen I referred to propagating, I should perhaps have mentioned the\r\ngrowing of hazel plants from seeds, that is from the nut, but I did not\r\nthink it necessary. I will, however, say that plants raised from seed\r\nshould never be planted for fruit bearing unless they are grafted or\r\nbudded, as it has been fully and positively proven that plants raised\r\nfrom seed, even if the very finest nuts of our European hybrids are\r\nplanted, will not produce nuts as good as those planted, but will almost\r\ninvariably go back to the original type, the _Corylus avellana_. It is\r\nalright to raise plants from seeds for the sake of getting stock to\r\ngraft or bud on, but, as to variety, the seedlings are unreliable.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to a close, I would like to say a few words about the\r\nfertilizing of the ground for hazel orchards and what experience I have\r\nhad in this matter, as I believe this would be of interest to all. It is\r\na well-known fact that hazel plants grow well and will thrive in almost\r\nany kind of soil, as long as it is not too wet or too heavy, but from\r\ntime to time a little manure worked in is very beneficial both to old\r\nand young plants, but care and judgment should be exercised, so as not\r\nto overdo it. I have growing in one of my city lots with very fertile\r\nsoil, several bearing hazel plants, 7 to 8 years old, different\r\nvarieties. These plants grow so immensely that it plainly shows, they\r\nare growing at the expense of the fruit, not only that the quantity of\r\nnuts gathered from a plant there is considerably less than of same sized\r\nplants grown on ordinary farmland, but the quality also is very much\r\nbelow. My best nuts are all grown on ordinary farmland and the greatest\r\nquantity has always been obtained from the farm where only very little\r\nfertilizing or manuring had been done. For the growing of young plants\r\nfor commercial purposes, for the trade, I should recommend liberal\r\nmanuring at all times. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Is the hazel a long lived tree?\r\n\r\nMR. VOLLERTSEN: I have known trees for almost forty years that\r\nare bearing good fruit year after year, although not always a good crop.\r\nThey don't seem to grow so rapidly at that age as when younger.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Hazels seem to graft pretty well on each other. I\r\nthink the tree hazel is going to be our most successful stock for\r\ngrafting. However, I have grafted on the _Corylus avellana_. The tree\r\nhazel does not put out any suckers.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Does the hazel find its way into the market\r\ncommercially?\r\n\r\nMR. VOLLERTSEN: I would almost think so. I have had lots of\r\ninquiries for them from storekeepers. It seems to me there are a great\r\nmany imported around here. Our American hazels are not so very good.\r\nThere may be here and there a fairly good one, but I have not found any\r\nreally good ones worth propagating. I think if we would do more\r\nscientific work we could get very good nuts. There is no question that\r\nthey are perfectly hardy and will stand almost any climate.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: Some of your varieties are hybrids aren't they?\r\n\r\nMR. VOLLERTSEN: They are all hybrids. I have a few of the real,\r\noriginal _avellana_ type I think got there by accident.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I believe the next paper is one the secretary\r\nhas from Mr. A. H. Graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASE RESISTANCE IN THE AMERICAN CHESTNUT[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR H. GRAVES\r\n\r\n(Read by the Secretary)\r\n\r\nYour secretary, Mr. Bixby, has asked me to tell you about the native\r\nchestnut trees in the vicinity of New York City which I have found to be\r\nresistant to the destructive bark disease. I commenced the search for\r\nsuch trees in the summer of 1918, at the suggestion of Dr. Haven\r\nMetcalf, of the laboratory of Forest Pathology, Bureau of Plant\r\nIndustry. During the campaign in Pennsylvania against the bark disease,\r\nscouts had been on the lookout for immune or resistant trees, but\r\nwithout result. As far as I am aware, no systematic organized search had\r\nbeen made for such individuals.\r\n\r\nIt was our plan to commence the search in the region of New York City,\r\nbecause this area is probably the oldest center of infection in the\r\nUnited States. Apparently this is the port of entry where the\r\nundesirable immigrants (Japanese or Chinese chestnuts) passed through\r\nquarantine and were allowed to disembark carrying their terrible scourge\r\nwith them unnoticed. According to Metcalf and Collins,[2] this was\r\nprobably as early as 1893. This was why we selected this area to begin\r\non, for here the disease has had a longer opportunity to run its course\r\nthan anywhere else, and, consequently, has had ample time (more than a\r\nquarter of a century) to call out the non-resistant trees. Those\r\nremaining, if any could be found, might be suspected, _a priori_, of\r\nbeing resistant.\r\n\r\nAs the work progressed, I soon realized that it would be most difficult,\r\nor perhaps impossible, to locate resistant or immune trees in a region\r\nnot so long exposed to infection; for, in such a region, one would have\r\nto inoculate all individuals suspected of possessing resistant\r\nqualities, in order to ascertain whether their healthy condition was\r\nactually due to resistant qualities or simply the result of a chance\r\nescape of infection. We therefore decided to restrict the work, for the\r\npresent at least, entirely to a definite area about New York City. This\r\narea includes all of the territory within a radius of about 16 miles\r\nfrom New York City Hall, and therefore comprised in a general way,\r\nGreater New York and the adjacent parts of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF THE SURVEY\r\n\r\nFirst I made a thorough canvas of Staten Island, doing the work on foot,\r\naided by the trolley and the Staten Island R. R., and often guided by\r\nthat genial naturalist and lover of Staten Island, Dr. Arthur Hollick of\r\nthe Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, I made a careful\r\nsurvey of the whole 64 square miles of which the island is composed.\r\nAfter two weeks of this kind of work, I began to get fairly well\r\ndiscouraged, not so much because of lack of results which, it is true,\r\nwere entirely negative, but more on account of the appearance of the\r\ndead chestnuts. For where it was not entirely cut out, the bare,\r\nweathered poles showed that they had been dead for many years. The only\r\nencouraging feature was the finding of large quantities of healthy\r\nseedlings, from 7 years of age upward, to which I will refer later.\r\n\r\nThe Palisade region along the Hudson has been notable in the past for\r\nits chestnut forests. I next attacked this, making as thorough a search\r\nas possible from Hoboken to a little north of Alpine, N. J., which is a\r\nsmall place on the Hudson opposite Yonkers. Here also the vast forests\r\nof dead poles weathered gray with time, bore silent witness to the\r\ncompleteness of the destruction.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of July while ferrying across the Hudson, I noticed\r\nnorth of the landing at Dyckman St., what appeared to be chestnut trees\r\nin bloom. On investigation, I found these to be living native chestnuts,\r\nof the peculiar strip type I shall describe later, and proceeding\r\nfurther north from this, where the Harlem enters the Hudson. I was led\r\ninto a forest where I found at least 40 living chestnuts, some of which\r\nwere in good condition, and one particularly was leafy nearly to the\r\ntop. (Fig. 1) Naturally, one would immediately suspect that somehow\r\nthese trees had escaped infection, but this could not possibly be the\r\ncase, for mixed in with them on all sides were bare, weathered trunks\r\nshowing signs of old worn cankers, proving incontestibly that the fungus\r\nhad been present here also for a long period. Shortly afterward, Dr.\r\nOlive, of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, informed me that he had seen\r\nliving chestnuts near Hollis, L. I., and at Valley Stream, L. I., and at\r\neach of these places I found a group similar to that near the Harlem.\r\n\r\nThese, in brief, are the high spots of the survey from the point of view\r\nof the scientist. In addition, I covered adjacent region of New Jersey\r\nto the west, including the Watchung Mt. range about Plainfield and the\r\nOranges; the Bronx and Van Cortland Park and the country to Yonkers and\r\nthe north, and to the northeast of New Rochelle. Long Island, as far as\r\nHempstead, was also included. Altogether I travelled about 1200 miles on\r\nfoot, not counting the distance traversed on trolleys and railroads.\r\nAlways armed with opera glasses, I was careful not to use them when\r\nanyone was looking, for on the second day of the survey I had been\r\narrested on the charge of being a German spy! I was also arrested on\r\nboard a train in New Jersey for looking earnestly at a topographic map,\r\nthen sharply out of the car window and noting what I had seen (dead\r\nchestnut trees) on said map. The carrying of a botanist's tin can\r\n(containing fungi, not bombs) was also an additional implicating\r\ncircumstance on the latter occasion.\r\n\r\nWhat then were the results of the survey? They may be stated briefly as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. No immune trees were found.\r\n\r\n2. For the most part the older trees (from 20 years upward) were\r\nentirely dead, and had been so for a long period, as attested by the\r\nbare trunks, weathered a characteristic gray color which only time can\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n3. However, large numbers of seedlings and young saplings were located,\r\nboth healthy and diseased.\r\n\r\n4. _The most important result was the finding of three well defined\r\ncolonies of living mature trees; all of which, by virtue of characters\r\nto be presently described, are offering more or less resistance to the\r\ndisease._\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDLING TREES\r\n\r\nIt is well known that seedlings and young saplings are naturally immune\r\nfor a certain period, which varies in extent from 8 to 15 years beyond\r\ngermination of the seed beginning, of course with the first formation of\r\nthe seedling. Such immunity depends, however, not on any inherent\r\ncharacteristic, but on the fact that at this period the bark is usually\r\nsmooth, sound, and free from wounds of any sort where Endothia spores\r\nand mycelium might enter. Of course, when wounded from any cause\r\nwhatever during this period of youth, this immunity ends, so that the\r\ncondition might perhaps be termed physical, in contrast to physiological\r\nimmunity.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, large numbers of seedlings, for the most part\r\nstill unattacked, were found in many places in the area surveyed. There\r\nare of course no grounds for believing that such seedlings, descended as\r\nthey are from non-resistant trees, are physiologically immune. Where\r\nthey are free from disease, this exemption is due merely to the physical\r\nimmunity I have just mentioned. Since they therefore represent\r\nnon-resistant stock, they were used for comparative inoculation work,\r\nwhich will be referred to later.\r\n\r\nI may as well say here as anywhere, that by resistance, I do not mean\r\ntotal resistance, for that would be immunity. There are, of course,\r\ndegrees of resistance, in the plant world just as in the animal world.\r\nOne person may resist a cold germ or the influenza bacillus better than\r\nanother, that is, it will cause him only a little discomfort. Another\r\nperson may not be affected at all, that is, he is totally resistant or\r\nimmune. I say this because I have misunderstood when I have used the\r\nterm resistance. The trees in the New York region show all grades of\r\nresistance, from individuals where the fungus makes very little headway\r\nin the bark, to cases where it grows almost as fast as in the average\r\nnon-resistant tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESISTANT TREES\r\n\r\nWhat now are the characteristics of these resistant trees? How are we\r\ngoing to know one when we see it? I have outlined the leading features\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1. BARK. In the case of this particular disease, it is obvious\r\nthat the character of the bark is the most important feature since this\r\nfungus is primarily parasitic in the living cortex. In other words, the\r\ncharacter of resistance must necessarily depend on the living cells of\r\nthe cortex. Now, careful observation of the resistant trees reveals a\r\nmost striking feature of the bark, namely its tendency to heal, by means\r\nof a callus growth around the margins of the lesions, whether large or\r\nsmall; and it is very apparent that this callus growth wards off the\r\nadvance of the fungus for a time at least. When the callus growth is\r\nonce formed, the fungus of the original canker encroaches on it very\r\nslowly, or often not at all. Inoculations in the callused margins of\r\ncankers showed usually only slight growth of the fungus after two\r\nmonths' time in the summer, or in some cases no growth at all. Several\r\nlayers of wood could be counted underneath these callused margins--often\r\n6 or 7--before reaching the annual ring exposed at the surface of the\r\ncanker. This of course, shows unquestionably that the callus had\r\nremained healthy at that location for that period of time.\r\n\r\n2. EXTENSION OF THE CALLUS TISSUE.--In many cases the callus\r\ntissue is of considerably greater extent than the normal area one would\r\nexpect around a wound. It may even occur that the whole inner bark\r\naround the trunk is of a callused nature, without any open cankers\r\nshowing at all. For example in a tree of which I have a photograph here\r\n(Figs. 2 and 4), the outer bark is sloughing off, revealing callused\r\nbark underneath of entirely different appearance, which no one would\r\nrecognize as chestnut bark. This particular tree photographed represents\r\nan extreme in this respect. It seemed as if the whole tree was getting a\r\nnew kind of bark, and yet this same character appears in all of the\r\nhighly resistant trees. On cutting into this new callused inner bark it\r\nwas found plentifully dotted with tiny _Endothia_ lesions, which\r\nhowever, never penetrated deeply. (Fig 4). Close to the cambium the\r\nwhite inner bark is quite healthy, generally for a thickness of 5-7 mm.\r\nThat the mycelium in the small lesions was unquestionably the _Endothia_\r\nmycelium, was shown by the appearance of the mycelium, and the presence\r\nof the _Endothia_ pustules in many of the spots. That these were not\r\nlate infections, but only slowly growing small lesions, was shown by\r\ninoculations in such bark, which revealed scarcely any growth after two\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1\r\n\r\nOne of the most resistant trees, the smaller tree near the center of the\r\nphotograph, near the Harlem River, Boro of Manhattan, New York City.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2\r\n\r\nA very strikingly resistant tree at Valley Stream, Long Island, showing\r\npeculiar inner bark.

At one place, near the center of the photograph, the bark has been\r\nshaved showing the small lesions caused by the fungus.]\r\n\r\n3. THE WHITE SECRETION.--The most striking peculiarity of the\r\ncallus tissue, is its abundant content of a thickish, milky, white\r\nsubstance. This came to light immediately when I cut into the callus,\r\nand it showed up very clearly when I shaved off the outer layers of dead\r\ncork tissue. The white material is not evenly distributed through the\r\nirregular grain of the wound tissue, but is particularly abundant in\r\nsmall spots or pockets which are especially conspicuous in the callused\r\nmargin of the lesion. Soon after exposure to the air the cut bark, and\r\nparticularly the white substance, redden rapidly, indicating oxidation.\r\nThis peculiarity is of course true of all chestnut bark, yet here the\r\nreddening seems to be deeper and more rapid than the normal. No chemical\r\nanalysis has yet been made of this substance, but there is\r\nsufficient other evidence at hand to warrant a tentative statement\r\nthat it is very rich in tannin or tannin compounds, and that possibly\r\nthe quality of resistance is bound up with the nature of this material.\r\n\r\n4. THE STRIP CONDITION.--Some of the trees showed the living\r\nbark restricted to a narrow, flattened, rope-like strip running up the\r\ntrunk to one or a very few branches (Plate 1, Fig. 3). In these cases\r\nall of the bark was of the callus nature, rich in the resistant\r\nsubstance, and plentifully besprinkled with small Endothia lesions,\r\nwhile underneath were a number of layers of functioning wood. The rest\r\nof the trunk was bare, weathered gray, with traces on its surface of old\r\ncankers, and evidently dead for a long period. This type of tree was so\r\ncommonly found that I have called it the strip tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nINOCULATIONS\r\n\r\nThe very fact that these trees are now alive in this New York region is\r\npretty good proof of their resistance. But of course the most conclusive\r\ntest is by inoculation with the fungus in question. If the fungus grows\r\nslowly in these trees as compared with its growth on non-resistant\r\nstock, then no one can deny that they are resistant. I will not bore you\r\nwith figures of tables, I will only give you the results. The average\r\ngrowth of the fungus in 289 inoculations on the resistant trees was\r\nabout 1/3 as fast as on non-resistant stock, and taking the rate of\r\ngrowth on those trees which are especially resistant it is about 1/4 as\r\nfast as on the non-resistant stock. For non-resistant stock the\r\nseedlings on Staten Island were inoculated, and the growth on these\r\ntallied very closely with growth in non-resistant trees inoculated by\r\nAnderson and Rankin.[3]\r\n\r\nAnother very striking result brought out by the inoculation work was\r\nthat of the 158 inoculations on branches and basal shoots of the\r\nresistant trees, only nine had been girdled after one month's growth,\r\nwhile in the same time 16 out of the 32 non-resistant Staten Island\r\ntrees were girdled. At the end of the second month, the results were\r\nstill more striking. Then, in the Staten Island trees, 22 out of 32 were\r\ngirdled, while in the inoculations on the basal shoots and branches of\r\nresistant stock only 22 out of the 153 resulted in girdling. This\r\nstriking difference was not due to smaller diameters of the Staten\r\nIsland trees, for particular pains were taken to have them approximately\r\nequal to the branches and shoots inoculated in the resistant trees.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCES OF RESISTANCE\r\n\r\nWe may summarize the evidences of resistance as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The results of the inoculation tests show that the fungus grows in\r\nthese trees on the average from 1/4 to 1/3 as fast as in ordinary\r\nchestnut.\r\n\r\n2. The occurrence of the trees in a neighborhood long subjected to the\r\ndisease, and their presence among the trees of individuals long since\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n3. Indications of the long period the disease has been present in the\r\ntrees themselves; such as bare weathered tops, and healed cankers.\r\n\r\n4. Peculiarities of the bark; such as extensive development of the\r\ncallus tissue, and the presence of a peculiar substance or white\r\nsecretion which is particularly conspicuous in cases of marked\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS THE DISEASE RESISTANCE HERE AN HEREDITARY CHARACTER?\r\n\r\nAs to whether this disease resistance is an inherent character and will\r\nbe transmitted from generation to generation, or is only the result of\r\nparticularly favorable environmental conditions such as soil, light or\r\nmoisture, is a point of great practical importance. I believe that\r\nfurther work will prove that the resistance is heritable, for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The resistance is not due to a particularly favorable environment of\r\nthe trees, for the three groups grow in very different soils and under\r\nvarying conditions of light and moisture.\r\n\r\n2. The finding of the trees in colonies points to a genetic variation.\r\nAt first I was unable to account for the grouping of the trees, for I\r\nhad expected to find immune or resistant trees singly, here and there.\r\nBut if we adopt the hypothesis of a heritable protoplasmic\r\nvariation--something in their \"blood,\" so to speak, the explanation is\r\neasy. We know that chestnut fruits or nuts do not travel far, like the\r\nseeds of willow, poplar, maple or ash, and therefore, in any given stand\r\nof chestnut, if we could go back from generation to generation into\r\nearlier time, most probably the majority of the trees would be found to\r\nhave arisen from a common ancestor, although of course a few outsiders\r\nwould have found their way into the group, carried by squirrels or other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n3. In a considerable number of cases all the members of the same group\r\nof coppice trunks from an old stump show a similar degree of resistance.\r\nTo attribute such a condition as due merely to chance, occurring as\r\noften as it does, would be placing a pretty large burden on chance; and\r\nsince the coppice trunks are all off-shoots of the same plant, the\r\ncondition is what one would expect were the resistant quality in\r\ninherent character. A correspondence of degree of resistance was also\r\nnoted, in the inoculations made on branches, trunk, and basal shoots of\r\nthe same individual tree.\r\n\r\nExperimental work is being carried on at Washington to test out the\r\ntruth of this hypothesis, i. e. to see whether or not the disease\r\nresistance is really heritable. The work is being carried on in\r\nconnection with the propagation of other resistant stock, Chinese,\r\nJapanese, etc.; and, as soon as the department is sure of the product,\r\nthe results will be distributed to nut growers and others who are\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we can all help by being on the lookout for resistant\r\nnative trees. I believe they will be found in many places besides the\r\nNew York region.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Illustration for this paper will be found opposite page 64.\r\n\r\n[2] Metcalf, Haven & Collins, J.

KELLOGG: Ladies and Gentlemen: Battle Creek has the\r\nhonor today and tomorrow to entertain the Northern Nut Growers'\r\nAssociation. This association with other associations having similar\r\npurposes, is undertaking to do, it seems to me, one of the most\r\nimportant things that can be done for the American people--to show us\r\nhow we can get our nitrogen, our protein, and our fats without the\r\nlivestock industry which is wasting at least nine-tenths of the grain,\r\nor in fact at least nineteen-twentieths of all our foodstuffs. The great\r\ncause of the high cost of living at the present time is that the pigs\r\nand the cattle are eating up our corn and other good things that we\r\nought to eat ourselves. If we had a sufficient area of land, perhaps\r\neven the sides of our roadways and railways planted out to black walnuts\r\nand other good nut trees, we would have all the protein and fat we\r\nneeded, perhaps as much as we are getting now, and more, and the cattle\r\nindustry might be entirely dismissed from consideration, and a great\r\ndeal of labor would be saved. I am sure that there is no place in the\r\nwhole United States where this Association could have a heartier welcome\r\nthan here in Battle Creek, or where people could be found who would\r\nappreciate its labors any more. You are going to have a very interesting\r\nprogram tonight. We are favored with visits from very distinguished\r\ngentlemen from all over the United States, among others Dr. Robert T.\r\nMorris, the nestor of American surgeons has come all the way from New\r\nYork to tell us about some wonderful discoveries he has made, and a\r\nfatherless walnut tree he is cultivating, and other things that will be\r\nof great interest to us all I am sure. I take pleasure in introducing to\r\nyou the president of this Association, Mr. W. C. Reed, of Vincennes,\r\nIndiana. Mr. Reed.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: We are simply continuing our program. This\r\nafternoon we were in session at the Annex and moved over here this\r\nevening so as to be able to present what we have here so we could\r\nentertain more of you than we could over there to advantage. You know\r\nthat most all men have a hobby along some line or other, and those who\r\nconstitute our leaders, whom we have to look to, and along the line of\r\nnut trees of different species and so on, we have learned to look to Dr.\r\nMorris as one of the leaders. I have great pleasure in introducing to\r\nyou Dr. Robert T. Morris, of New York, who will address you on the\r\nhickory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON THE HICKORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT T. MORRIS, M. D., NEW YORK CITY, N. Y.\r\n\r\nWhen people speak of the \"hickory\" without qualification, they are apt\r\nto have in mind some one kind of hickory which belonged to their boyhood\r\nenvironment. All other kinds which they happened to know, were qualified\r\nin some way, very much as the word \"fish\" in Boston stands for the\r\ncodfish only, other kinds of fish in the world being described by\r\nqualifying names. In the northeast the hickory means the shagbark. In\r\nMissouri it means the shellbark. Elsewhere the pignut and the mockernut\r\nare called \"hickory.\" Interest in the subject has increased so rapidly\r\nof late years that we must all of us be more particular in our\r\ndescriptions and add qualifying names, speaking always of the shagbark\r\nhickory, pecan hickory, or bitternut hickory as the case may be. Sargent\r\ndescribes fifteen species of hickory and in addition a large number of\r\nvarieties by environment and by hybridization. There is a Mexican\r\nhickory, making sixteen species for the North American continent, and\r\nthe late Mr. F. N. Meyer, Agricultural Explorer from Washington, has\r\nfound a hickory in China. Previous to this discovery, it was believed\r\nthat the hickories belonged to the North American continent only.\r\n\r\nBotanists divide the hickories into two groups, Apocarya and Eucarya.\r\nFor convenience in every day conversation, it might be well for us to\r\nspeak of the \"open-bud\" group and the \"closed bud\" group. _Apocarya_ or\r\nthe \"open bud\" group, includes the pecan hickory, _Carya pecan_, the\r\nbitternut hickory, _Carya cordiformis_, the bitter pecan, _Carya\r\ntexana_, the water hickory, _Carya aquatica_, the nutmeg hickory, _Carya\r\nmyristicaeformis_, and the Chinese hickory, _Carya cathayensis_. The\r\nwinter buds of this group will be seen on examination to show the\r\nminute, snugly curled-up leaves which are ready to burst forth when the\r\nspringtime sun opens the fronds of the ferns which have forced their way\r\nthrough the hard ground with clenched fists. The scale buds in the\r\nopen-bud group do not cover the tiny leaf forms completely.\r\n\r\nIn _Eucarya_, or the \"closed-bud\" group, stout scales close the bud\r\ncompletely against the snow and ice of wintry days, so that we see\r\nscales only when looking at the bud. The closed-bud hickories include\r\nthe shagbark, _Carya ovata_, the Carolina hickory, _Carya\r\nCarolinae-septentrionalis_, the shellbark, _Carya laciniosa_, the\r\nmockernut, _Carya alba_, the smooth-bark hickory, _Carya leiodermis_,\r\nthe pallid hickory, _Carya pallida_, the close-bark pignut, _Carya\r\nglabra_, the loose-bark pignut, _Carya ovalis_, the Florida hickory,\r\n_Carya Floridana_, the Buckley hickory, _Carya Buckleyi_, and the\r\nMexican hickory, _Carya Mexicana_.\r\n\r\nHickories which have nuts with a bitter pellicle, all belong to the\r\nopen-bud group. These are the bitternut, Texas hickory, and water\r\nhickory. Hickories with scaly bark are found in both groups. In the\r\nopen-bud group, the trunk of the water hickory carries long loose bark\r\nstrips attached by one end, and in the closed-bud group, we find this\r\ncharacteristic belonging to the shagbark, shellbark, Carolina hickory,\r\nand to one of the pignuts, Carya ovalis. That takes us to another\r\noccasion for a note. What do we mean by \"pignut?\" In the North, this\r\nterm is applied to Carya glabra and Carya ovalis. In the South, it is\r\napplied to Carya cordiformis. A name so well established, will have to\r\nbe retained, but in our Association it will perhaps be best to have an\r\nunderstanding about which one of the hickories the common name pignut\r\nshould belong. So long as it already covers two species in the North as\r\nopposed to one in the South, there are already two votes to one in favor\r\nof retaining the name pignut for Carya glabra and Carya ovalis. We may\r\ndescribe these in plain language as the smooth-bark pignut and the\r\nloose-bark pignut. The reason for choosing the name \"loose\" instead of\r\n\"scaly\" is because we are pretty well agreed upon applying the name\r\n\"scalybark\" to the Carolina hickory, the name \"shagbark\" to Carya ovata,\r\nand the name shellbark to Carya laciniosa. The name bitternut may\r\nsafely be allowed to remain with Carya cordiformis because the other two\r\nnuts with bitter pellicle already have distinctive names, Carya aquatica\r\nbeing called water hickory and Carya texana being called bitter pecan.\r\nBy making fixed points in nomenclature in this way we may head off the\r\nconfusion which will become worse confounded as the interest in\r\nhickories becomes rapidly enlarged, if our committee on nomenclature\r\ndoes not take some decisive step.\r\n\r\nConcerning Latin nomenclature, we have further troubles for settlement.\r\nHicoria is the oldest generic name and naturally should have priority\r\nbut the Vienna Congress of Botanists adopted Carya. So far so good (or\r\nbad). Now comes our trouble in giving specific and varietal names. The\r\nbinomial is clearly applicable enough for species, Carya pecan, for\r\nexample, but when we come to varieties of the pecan there are two kinds\r\nof varieties to be considered, those by environment and those by\r\nhybridization. In cases of natural variation we are still within\r\naccepted resources in nomenclature by saying for example, Carya pecan,\r\nvar, Stuartii. When naming hybrid varieties, however, I would suggest\r\nthat in advance of the abbreviation \"var\", we place the abbreviation\r\n\"hyb.\" thus reading for Brown's pecan, \"Carya pecan, hyb. var. Brownii,\"\r\ninstead of \"Carya Brownii,\" which latter binomial would throw it among\r\nthe species. In view of the fact that we are to have in the future\r\nhundreds of named hybrids, it seems to me that we must adopt some such\r\ndefinite method for convenience promptly. This method of naming, relates\r\nto convenience and is applied to the most evident parent. As a matter of\r\nfact, in horticultural circles we are doing precisely that sort of\r\nthing, speaking, for example, of \"Brown's pecan\" meaning a nut which we\r\nrecognize as being a hybrid, brought to attention by Brown but with the\r\npecan as parent most strongly in evidence.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy, the only hickory nuts of any sort available, were\r\nthose collected from wild trees. The popular boy was one who knew of\r\nsome trees which furnished the best nuts and who did not keep the news\r\nto himself. The squirrels knew the best nuts as well as the boys did and\r\nthey would go past many hickory trees along fences and groves in order\r\nto congregate in the ones which had the nuts with the thinnest shells\r\nand plumpest meats of best quality. In the early morning hours I have\r\nseen several squirrels in one particularly good hickory nut tree and not\r\na single squirrel in a tree completely filled with nuts, though its\r\nbranches touches those of the first one. Men are quite as intelligent\r\nas squirrels in some respects. Here and there attempts were made at\r\npropagating fine hickory trees of various species by planting nuts. It\r\nwas not generally known at that time that the hickories were so\r\nthoroughly crossed like the apples, that they would not reproduce true\r\nto type from seed. Attempts were then made at grafting which were mostly\r\nfailures for many years. We are now on the verge of a great development\r\nin hybridization or crossing of choice kinds of hickories and in\r\ndetermining upon which stocks the different kinds of selected hickories\r\nmay be grown to best advantage. Hybrids between varieties of hickories\r\noccur frequently in nature and hybrids between species of hickories\r\noccur occasionally. A number of these accidental hybrids have been\r\ndiscovered and some of them are now being propagated. For the most part\r\nthey do not represent the best quality of the best parent but it is a\r\nnotable fact that the bitterness of kinds with the bitter pellicle\r\nappears to be a recessive character and disappears usually from hybrids\r\nbetween species in which one parent has a bitter nut. Unfortunately, the\r\nfiner extractive which give character to the nut of the better parent\r\nare prone to disappear also. This is in line with our experience in\r\nmixing of characters along Mendelian lines. Given a sufficient number of\r\nhybrids and we shall have here and there one with spectacular\r\ncharacteristics of special value.\r\n\r\nNow that horticulturists at the present moment are turning so freely\r\ntoward the idea of producing quantities of hybrids artificially, the\r\nnext generation will see hickory nuts which were not dreamed of in the\r\ndays when I was a boy. The crossing of hickories is not difficult work.\r\nWe simply remove the male flowers from branches carrying female flowers\r\nbefore the male flowers have begun to shed their pollen. The female\r\nflowers are then covered with oiled paper bags tied over them for\r\nprotection and when the danger from self pollination has passed, we take\r\noff the bags and add a little pollen which we have kept for the\r\npurpose--pollen from some trees bearing remarkably valuable nuts.\r\n\r\nNuts resulting from this cross pollination when planted, give us new\r\nvarieties of trees which never have been seen before by anybody and that\r\nis so interesting that very many people will probably take up\r\nhybridization as an incident in recreation. Some of the hybrids will\r\nbear very early in their history and others very late. If one is\r\nimpatient to determine at once which ones are to be valuable, he can\r\nhurry the process by grafting a number of cuttings from young seedling\r\ntrees into the tops of larger trees which are already bearing--labeling\r\neach graft, so that he may keep track of the seedling stock from which\r\nit came. It is possible to put one hundred or more seedlings in the top\r\nof some stock tree at one time.\r\n\r\nOne reason for delay in propagation by grafting is because the hickories\r\nlike many other trees are slow in making repair of wounds. Grafts\r\nusually perished before being accepted by the stock under grafting\r\nmethods that were in common use. The best step forward in grafting\r\nmethod for hickories is one that I obtained from Mr. J. F. Jones,\r\nLancaster, Pennsylvania. He tells me that he obtained the method from\r\nits originator, Mr. E. A. Riehl, Godfrey, Illinois. This consisted in\r\ncovering the entire graft, buds and all, with melted grafting wax and\r\nincluding also all of the wound and wrapping of the stock. The buds make\r\ntheir way through this grafting wax without any difficulty, but the\r\ngrafting wax used by Mr. Jones contained lamp black and that used by Mr.\r\nRiehl consisted of a beeswax and rosin mixture. It was found that these\r\nseemed to be applicable in the North but not farther south in the hotter\r\nsun. Examining into the reasons for this, it seemed to me that in all\r\nprobability the black grafting wax used by Mr. Jones and the brown or\r\namber grafting wax used by Mr. Riehl, would naturally allow the heat\r\nrays of the sun to pass through to the graft while halting the actinic\r\nray of light. The latter is extremely valuable for promoting the\r\nactivity of chlorophyl, which acts only in the presence of light and in\r\nthe best way in the best light. The heat rays might have certain\r\ndestructive qualities. With this theoretical idea of the situation in\r\nmind, I employed melted paraffin in place of the grafting wax, covering\r\nthe scions completely as well as the wound in the stock and the\r\nwrappings. This immediately proved to be a success. In fact, it appears\r\nto have changed the entire subject of grafting nut trees in such a way\r\nthat any intelligent boy employing this method can now do better hickory\r\nnut grafting than would have been possible at the hands of an expert two\r\nyears ago. The melted paraffin fills the interstices in which sap might\r\ncollect and ferment, but at the same time, hardening so quickly that it\r\ndoes not introduce the danger of extension between points of contact\r\nwith scion and stock. The second point of value consists in allowing the\r\nactinic ray in the sunlight to act upon the chlorophyl in bud and bark\r\nof the scion and it does not attract the destructive heat ray. This is\r\nperhaps the most important single point of value and due to the\r\ntransparency of the paraffin. Third, the paraffin coating, impervious to\r\nair, maintains the sap tension equally in the course of fluctuation\r\nbetween negative and positive pressures occurring between night and\r\nday, and under varying conditions of light and temperature. This\r\nmaintenance of equalised sap tension, I believe to be important. The\r\nparaffin is waterproof and prevents evaporation from the scion, which\r\notherwise is prone to dry out before granulation of the wound has taken\r\nplace in the hickories, as in other species which callus slowly. Fifth,\r\nunder the paraffin coating of stock and scion, the plant apparently does\r\nnot have that anxiety which would otherwise lead it to introduce the\r\nprotective feature of superization, the spreading of a corky layer over\r\nthe wound surface between stock and scion, thus introducing a mechanical\r\nobstacle to union.\r\n\r\nThis method of grafting has extended the grafting season for nearly two\r\nmonths, apparently. Formerly, I hurried to get all of the grafts in\r\nwhile buds were bursting, in early May. During the season of 1919 I\r\ngrafted hickories up to August sixth experimentally. The last grafts\r\nwhich caught well in a practical way were put in on July twenty-first.\r\nAfter that the proportion of catches was small and the growth feeble.\r\nIncidentally, it may be remarked that filberts grafted as late as August\r\nsixth, did perfectly well. The scions employed were cut in late winter\r\nand kept in the sawdust of my icehouse. I formerly supposed that ice\r\nbeneath the sawdust was important, but this year I could not get ice and\r\nthe scions kept just as well. In July, experiments were tried with\r\ngrafting directly from one tree to another, using wood of the season's\r\ngrowth. This worked well with hazels, but not with hickories or walnuts,\r\nonly one out of many hickory grafts catching. That one, however, is\r\nsignificant and I hope to work out principles which will allow of direct\r\ngrafting of hickories as readily as may be done with the hazels.\r\n\r\nWhen a hickory graft is to be inserted into a small stock or branch, the\r\nordinary cleft graft does well. In stock recipients much larger than the\r\ngraft a side cleft of the width of the scion only is desirable, or\r\nbetter yet the \"split bark\" method devised by Mr. E. A. Riehl. A\r\nstraight split is made in the bark of the end of the stock, and the\r\ngraft crowded down into this split so that it remains between bark and\r\nwood finally. My own method for large stocks, is what I have called \"the\r\nslot bark method.\" This consists in turning down a width of stock bark\r\nmeasuring the same as the scion in width. When the scion has been\r\ninserted into this slot so made, the bark is turned up over it again and\r\nfastened there. By this method I have put scions in the trunks of trees\r\nnearly a foot in diameter and at any chosen point, sometimes several\r\nfeet below the ends of cut branches. One may cut off the top of a large\r\nhickory tree and then peg the trunk full of scions by means of bark\r\nslots.\r\n\r\nAnother important point in hickory propagation work consists in the\r\nemployment of the Spanish windlass for fastening graft and stock\r\ntogether. The old time wrapping of twine or of raffia had to be released\r\nin order to allow growth at the point of union of scion and stock. When\r\ncord is used it cuts deeply into the new growth, and raffia, which is\r\nplaced on flat, will be burst open. In either case new wrapping is\r\nrequired at a precarious time, according to old methods. The Spanish\r\nwindlass, which is used in surgery for controlling haemorrage, seemed to\r\nme to be applicable for fastening scions in place. It consists in a\r\nparaffined cord with ends tied in a firm knot but hanging loosely about\r\nthe graft and wound. A wooden skewer or any small lever, is then\r\ninserted into the loose loop of cord and twisted about until the part of\r\nthe cord about the graft wound is so snug that it holds the scion in\r\nplace more firmly than it can be held by any other sort of wrapping. In\r\norder to prevent the cord from cutting into the bark, two shields of\r\nwood or metal an inch in length, are interposed between cord and bark.\r\nThe lever of the Spanish windlass is fastened with a cord or with a\r\ngalvanized nail in order to prevent the windlass from unwinding and the\r\nwhole covered with melted paraffin. This may remain in place for two\r\nseasons without change, holding the scion firmly in place all of that\r\ntime and requiring no attention. The growing stock separates the two\r\nshields very much as it might separate two stones in the field and\r\nautomatically unwinds the Spanish windlass by sheer force, just enough\r\nto allow growth without any unloosening of its holding apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn hickory grafting, much experimental work remains to be done in the\r\nchoice of stocks for grafts of different species. Almost all of the\r\nhickories that have been grafted upon the pecan hickory stock, seem to\r\ndo pretty well upon that stock, but the converse is not true. The pecan\r\napparently does not do well as a rule when grafted upon other hickory\r\nstocks, even upon those of its cousins in the open-bud group. The\r\nshagbark hickory, in my experience, has done best upon stocks of the\r\nshagbark or mockernut or pignut. A number of years, however, are\r\nrequired in some cases for determining that point. Shagbarks which I\r\nhave grafted upon bitternuts have sometimes made a remarkably good\r\nstart. Then at the end of three or four years they begin to slow up,\r\nwhile shagbarks on shagbark stock, starting slowly at first, surpassed\r\nthe ones on bitternut stock finally.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1919, I topworked two trees standing near together and\r\nof about the same size (thirty feet) with Beaver hybrid (a cross between\r\nthe bitternut and the shagbark). One of the trees was a bitternut and\r\nthe other a pignut. Almost everyone of the grafts of the Beaver grew\r\nthriftily on the bitternut. Those on the pignut stock practically all\r\ncaught and made short growth and then began to wilt back. Finally, only\r\none shoot remained alive. This very striking object lesson will have\r\nbearing in varying degrees in all of our hickory grafting. According to\r\nmy experience to date, hybrid hickories are grafted more readily than\r\nare straight species or varieties. They seem to have lost family pride\r\nand seem to take up with any friend offering economic support. In the\r\ncase just quoted, however, caprice was shown by the Beaver hybrid which\r\ntook eagerly to a host of the species of one of its parents. It refused\r\nto thrive on the pignut which did not represent either one of its\r\nparents although that same pignut stock would have been accepted by\r\nshagbark scions--the shagbark representing the other parent of the\r\nBeaver. This sort of experience throws open the entire subject in such a\r\nlarge way as to show what possibilities of success and failure lie\r\nbefore us in experimental work. The same method of grafting, the\r\nparaffin windlass method, was employed for these two trees which were\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nInteresting experimental work is to be done in finding the extent to\r\nwhich different species and varieties of hickories may be grown out of\r\ntheir indigenous range. At Stamford, the bitter pecan from Texas,\r\nappears to be perfectly hardy but it makes very slow growth--sometimes\r\nless than an inch in a year. The Buckley hickory also from Texas, grows\r\nthriftly at Stamford and so does the Carolina hickory Pecans from the\r\nnorthern belt thrive at Merribrooke, but those from the southern belt\r\nhave such a long growing season, that their new wood is not yet\r\nsufficiently well lignified to stand the winter well. Some of them pull\r\nthrough a mild winter in fairly good order, but on the whole they do not\r\nthrive.\r\n\r\nThe commercial side of hickory raising, is being worked out for the\r\npecan only at the present time. We may assume that several of the other\r\nspecies of hickory adapted to growing in the north, will equal pecans in\r\nimportance, eventually. The reason for that is because some of the other\r\nhickories stand quite as high as the pecan in food value and general\r\nexcellence. At the time of writing, low grade seedling shellbark nuts\r\nfrom the West are selling in the retail market in New York for forty\r\ncents a pound. I have seen better nuts of this species being loaded on\r\nthe cars in Ohio at fifty cents a bushel. The present New York price, to\r\nbe sure, represents a profiteering war price. Fine grades of shagbark\r\nhickories and some of the hybrids will command prices equally high with\r\nprices for best pecans in the market of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nVOICE: Will it be practical to plant nuts, get young plants,\r\nand then bud or graft them?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Yes, that is what we do. It is practical to plant\r\nnuts for the purpose of getting a stock, but not for the purpose of\r\ngetting nuts. But we plant them in the nursery rows, and then when they\r\nare two years old, preferably (some like three-year-old trees), we graft\r\nthem over to good kinds in the nursery row; then they remain there for a\r\nyear or two, and are transferred or sold. We now have members of this\r\nassociation who are experts in grafting nut trees who make that a\r\nbusiness. It is not generally known that we have in this country three\r\njournals devoted wholly to the subject of nut culture. We have\r\nnurserymen who make a specialty of grafted nut trees of the very best\r\nsorts, so that one may perhaps take up this mode of farming more\r\nprofitably today than almost any other sort of farming. One gentleman in\r\nPennsylvania told me he made thirty thousand dollars on one crop of\r\nchestnuts two years ago, cultivated chestnuts. He had thirty acres, and\r\nno tree was yet fourteen years of age. His net profit beyond all\r\nexpenses was thirty thousand dollars that year. There are probably very\r\nfew professional men who make more than that a year. Many men are making\r\ngood, comfortable incomes out of their nut orchards. It is the best\r\ninsurance against the needs of old age, the best sort of life insurance.\r\n\r\nVOICE: Do you use anything besides the hickory as stock for\r\ngrafting on?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Yes, we have some experimenting to do in order to\r\nlearn which stock will best serve for a certain variety. We find that\r\none species or variety of hickory will accept other varieties of that\r\nspecies well, but perhaps it will not accept another species. We do know\r\nthat certain kinds do remarkably well on certain stocks; but the entire\r\nrange of that subject has not as yet been worked out.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Does the stock you graft on have any effect on the\r\nquality of the fruit?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: The stock on which you graft is supposed to have no\r\neffect at all on the quality of the fruit. But there are some\r\nexceptions. We learned that in orange grafting. A naval orange grafted\r\non the wild orange stock might be raggy, not full of juice; while when\r\ngrafted on the trifoliate orange stock might be heavy and full of juice.\r\nSo in that case the stock did have some influence upon the graft; and\r\nthere are other instances. But as a rule we assume that the stock has no\r\ninfluence upon the graft in regard to the validity of character.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Are pecans a variety of hickory?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Yes, pecans are hickories. The Indians gave it the\r\nname of pekan. The French spelled it pecanne, so that has been spelled\r\nas the pecan, without the necessary other part of its name, hickory. We\r\nshould always say pecan hickory--always.\r\n\r\nDR. KELLOGG: Dr. Morris, how old hickories may be used for\r\ngrafting?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: I have experimented with trees up to fifty years of\r\nage; but the most satisfactory work, perhaps, is done with trees that\r\nare not more than fifteen or twenty years of age and three or four or\r\nfive inches in diameter. Those are the best trees to work with. If we\r\ncut off the limbs of a very old tree and try to top work it, it means an\r\nenormous amount of work on the part of the orchardist, more work than my\r\nemployees like to give it. But one may topwork a tree of almost any age,\r\npreferably a tree less than twenty-five years of age; and by choice I\r\nshould say trees not more than ten years of age. We have experts in the\r\naudience better qualified to speak on that subject than I am.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do you prefer the melted paraffin to the\r\nold-fashioned way of using bees wax?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: The old-fashioned beeswax had a certain color, and\r\nthe black wax with charcoal, with lampblack, both turned the light ray\r\nand allowed the heat ray to enter so that the amber of the old resin\r\nwax, and the black of the black wax both allowed damage to occur to the\r\ntree, in the South particularly, in a hot climate early in the summer,\r\nprevented our grafting in the summer because of the turning away of the\r\nlight ray that was wanted and the absorption of the heat ray that was\r\nnot wanted. The melted paraffin being perfectly transparent, allows the\r\nlight ray to set the chlorophyl into activity. All the life processes of\r\nthe tree are carried on under the influence of the green chlorophyl\r\ngrains, and these work only in the presence of light.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Can you successfully graft a pecan on the pignut?\r\n\r\nQUESTION: What is the best stock to graft pecan on?\r\n\r\nDR.MORRIS: Pecan stock, I think. I do not think we have\r\nanything better. Mr. Reed and Mr. Jones are both experts in that field.\r\nThey have grafted hundreds of thousands of trees.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I think the pecan is the best. The hickory will\r\ngrow on the pecan very well, the shagbark hickory, but it will not do to\r\nchange it with any degree of success.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: The shagbarks will grow fairly well on pecans, but\r\nthe pecan not well on the shagbark. It is best I think to put shagbarks\r\non shagbark or shellbark. But they do well on pignut. I have got some\r\nvery good shagbarks on mockernut. On bitternut they grow fast, but at\r\nthe end of eight or ten years are inclined to slow up. Shagbark can be\r\nput on, I suppose, ten other kinds of hickory, but the pecan can not.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How many grafts would be necessary on a nut tree\r\ntwelve inches in diameter?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: I should say you would probably have to put in\r\nfifty. I would cut off the branches down to about two inches or an inch\r\nand a half in diameter, and that might leave fifty stubs to graft. Graft\r\nall of them, is one way to do it. Having done one that way, you will\r\nthen become familiar with the entire subject.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: What is the best time of year?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: I don't know. Some time ago the American\r\nAgriculturist said to its readers that there is disagreement about the\r\nbest time for pruning peach trees. Let us hear from all our readers. So\r\nall of the readers wrote expressing their opinions, and the editor\r\nsaid, \"Summing up all of the opinions, the entire testimony in the case,\r\nwe have decided that the time to prune your peach tree is when your\r\nknife is sharp.\" I had always supposed that the best time for grafting\r\nwas when the buds were first bursting in the spring, always held rigidly\r\nto that, and at that time of the year was in a great hurry. I dropped\r\nprofessional work and lost hundreds and even thousands of dollars in\r\norder to see this work go ahead; it is more interesting than\r\nprofessional work. And now this year, with this new method, I have\r\ngrafted right straight on up to the first of August, and everything\r\ngrowing--deliberately, all through the summer. So that now, at the\r\npresent moment I do not know. A year ago I could have told you. When I\r\nfirst graduated in medicine, I could answer any question in medicine.\r\nAfter forty years of surgery, I am puzzled over a great many questions.\r\nIt is the same way regarding grafting.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: In summer grafting do you remove the leaves from\r\nscions?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: In summer grafting I have used for the most part\r\nscions I have kept in the icebox in sawdust. I have formerly put in\r\ntwenty or thirty tons in my icehouse for my family to use during the\r\nsummer. Last winter we could not get any ice, and my scions were just as\r\ngood kept in the sawdust as if we had had ice; and I grafted those\r\nscions in August and the grafts are living. I have also cut off the\r\nleaves in grafting, but that is new and you can not depend on it,--stop\r\nat one tree, cut off a piece of it, and put it on another tree and have\r\nit grow. I have never done that until this year, and it does not succeed\r\nin a very large percentage. It is not practical. It can be done--I have\r\nproven that; but it is not practical. The best way is to use your scions\r\nfrom last year that have been kept in cold storage in sawdust or leaves.\r\n\r\nDR. KELLOGG: When should the scions be cut?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: There is some disagreement about that. Almost all\r\nscions may suffer a little winter injury. Some men prefer to cut in the\r\nearly part of December before we have had any hard winter, then keep\r\nthem in cold storage during the entire year, moderately moist, or\r\nprotected in sand, leaves, or stratification. But I have always\r\npreferred February myself, cutting them the last of February before the\r\nbuds begin to start, then put them in sawdust in the icehouse or cold\r\nstorage, or bury them under a thick layer of leaves. For budding you\r\ntransfer immediately. In fact, budding technically comes under the same\r\nphysiologic principles as grafting. In budding I do that work in my\r\nplace at Stamford, Conn., about the latter part of July or early August.\r\n\r\nDR. KELLOGG: Do you use the same method in transferring buds?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: Yes, I fix them the same way as I do the graft and\r\ncover everything with paraffin. I have even had a little short side\r\ngraft grow using this paraffin method, a graft two or three inches long.\r\n\r\nDR. KELLOGG: Tell us about those fatherless walnuts.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: In the course of crossing the nut trees, we\r\nsupposed, as a matter of course, that we must always have the pollen\r\nfrom one tree, or from a tree which bore the staminate or fertilizing\r\nflowers, in order to develop nuts or fruit of any sort; but on one\r\noccasion I covered a lot of Chinkapin female flowers with paper bags; I\r\ndidn't have pollen enough to go around and left the bags on because I\r\nhappened to be too lazy or too busy to pull them off. About a month\r\nlater when I did take them off I found a full set of chinkapin nuts\r\nunder those bags. They had received no pollen. That was an observation\r\nof a good deal of interest. It may have been that they had gone on by\r\nwhat we call parthenogenesis, and we had the children without the\r\nfather, had the female parent only, the fatherless chinkapin. It sounds\r\nsad. I followed up the experiment with other nut trees, and found that\r\nnot infrequently we may develop fatherless nuts. The effect will be,\r\naccording to natural law, to intensify the characteristics of one\r\nparent. The female which bears this fruit, this child, without a father,\r\nwill give to that child an intensification of her own characteristics.\r\nThat will be the effect of parthenogenesis. That may be continued\r\nthrough several generations perhaps; we do not know. It is new, quite\r\nnew. (Applause).\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: The next topic is the Digestibility of Nuts, by\r\nMr. Cajorie, of Yale University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF NUTS\r\n\r\nF. A. CAJORIE, YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CONN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President and members of the Northern Nut Growers' Association: It\r\nwas with great pleasure that I accepted the invitation of your\r\nAssociation to be present at this convention and give a discussion of\r\nnuts and nut production, from the point of view of their nutritive or\r\nfood value. During the last few years our knowledge of nutrition and the\r\nparts that individual foods may play in the diet has been greatly\r\nincreased and in the light of the new discoveries, it is interesting and\r\nvaluable to view the place that nuts hold.\r\n\r\nAs you are well aware, nuts have been used as foods by the peoples of\r\nthe world. In many places nut products have made up a very appreciable\r\npart of the diet. Chestnut flour is extensively used in Southern Europe.\r\nAmong the peasants of Tuscany, chestnut flour forms a considerable part\r\nof the total diet. In this region, also ground acorns are made into\r\nbread with cereal flours and in this form is a common food. The hazel or\r\nfilbert nut is also seen in the form of flour on the shores of the Black\r\nSea. Races living in the tropics have utilized the many varieties of\r\nnuts indigenous to tropical climes such as the coconut, Brazil nuts,\r\nJava almond, Paradise nut, candle nut and African cream nut. In the\r\nOrient, the lichi, ginko and water chestnut, and in Italy and India the\r\nvarieties of the pine nut are used to considerable extent.\r\n\r\nIn America, with the exception of a few localities and among a limited\r\nclass of people, nuts have never made up a staple part of our dietaries,\r\nrather they have been used as tasty supplements to otherwise complete\r\nmenus. That they are prized as adjuncts and are sought after is\r\nstrikingly shown when we see in our markets not only the products of our\r\nnative American nut trees, the hickory, walnut, butternut, chestnut,\r\npecan, beechnut and pinion, but the Brazil nut, filbert, English walnut,\r\npeanut, coconut, all of which are derived from foreign countries or from\r\ntrees originally imported to America from other lands.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of nuts have shown them to be of two types, one rich in fats\r\nand protein, the nitrogen containing component of our foods and the\r\nother relatively rich in carbohydrates, or starches. With the exception\r\nof the chestnut, and the coconut, most of our more common nuts belong to\r\nthis first class, and chemists have pointed out that in these nuts we\r\nhave a concentration of protein and fat seen in no other class of\r\nfoodstuffs. For example, the protein-fat rich nuts have a percentage of\r\nprotein varying between 15 and 30% and a fat content of 50-70%; compare\r\nthis with other foods that we think of as being concentrated; eggs, 12%\r\nprotein and 10% fat; cheese 28% protein, 37% fat; round steak, 20%\r\nprotein, 14% fat; and bread, 10% protein. This nutritive concentration\r\nin nuts places them in a unique position among our natural food\r\nproducts. Our cereals, meats, fruit and vegetables all contain more or\r\nless water or refuse that reduces their concentration, while in nuts we\r\nfind a compact form of almost pure food.\r\n\r\nWe are dependent on foods for the source of energy that is necessary to\r\nperform our work and maintain our body temperature much in the same way\r\nthat a steam engine is dependent on the fuel supplied it to perform the\r\nmechanical tasks assigned to it, and this fuel value of foods in turn,\r\ndepends on the amount of protein, carbohydrate and fat, particularly the\r\nlatter, that are present in the foods. At once we see, in our\r\nconcentrated nuts, a tremendous source of energy, provided that we can\r\ndigest these nuts and make this energy available.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact, as revealed by chemical analysis, that in nuts we have\r\na source of protein and fat in a concentration rarely seen in foods,\r\nthere have been relatively few experiments to actually determine the\r\ndigestibility. Prof Jaffa at the California Experiment Station was the\r\nfirst to make a comprehensive investigation along these lines. He made\r\nextensive digestion tests on men using most of the more common American\r\nnuts. His results, as reported in a bulletin of the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, indicated that nuts when they made up a substantial portion\r\nof the diet, were well digested by those who ate them and gave no\r\nintestinal disturbance or discomfort.\r\n\r\nNuts have had a reputation for indigestibility that was wide spread, not\r\nonly among people in general, but also among physicians and dieticians,\r\nand even Prof Jaffa's clear cut experiments failed to dispell this idea\r\nof indigestibility that had been empirically assigned to nuts. A few\r\nyears ago, a rather extensive series of digestion experiments were\r\ninaugurated at Yale University in an effort to settle this question of\r\nthe indigestibility of nuts and also to test out some of the commercial\r\nnut products to find what effect roasting, boiling, and other processes\r\nthat nuts are subjected to, had to do with the digestibility. Through\r\nthe courtesy of Dr Kellogg of Battle Creek, it was possible to follow up\r\nthese experiments with a series here at Battle Creek. It is the result\r\nof these tests that I wish to speak of today. One word regarding the\r\nmethod which is the conventional one for such experiments. The amount of\r\nfood eaten by the individual or animal is weighed at each meal and the\r\ncomposition determined by chemical analysis. The intestinal output is\r\ncollected, weighed and analysed. From the difference in any substance\r\nsuch as protein in the food and the protein which appears in the body\r\nrefuse, the amount digested and absorbed or utilized by the body is\r\neasily determined. For example; if 10gms. of nitrogen were eaten in the\r\nfood and one gm appears in the feces, we say that the coefficient of\r\ndigestibility of that nitrogen is 90%, that is 9 of the 10 gms. eaten\r\nwere absorbed by the body. The average of a great many such tests on\r\nmixed diets has the following standard coefficient: protein 93%, fat\r\n95%, and carbohydrates 98%.\r\n\r\nOur digestion experiments show the following results: for protein\r\ndigestion of nuts, almond 89%, peanut 84%, pine nut 89%, Eng. walnut,\r\n83%, Brazil 88%, and coconut 88%. In all cases the carbohydrate\r\ncoefficients are 98 or 99%, and in the case of the carbohydrate rich\r\nchestnut, normal digestion took place after the nut was heated so as to\r\nrupture the starch granules. In all of these cases the nut made up a\r\nsubstantial part of each meal and was eaten in large amounts. The\r\nexperimental subject, experienced no digestive troubles or discomforture\r\nwhatsoever except in the case of the English walnut, which evidently\r\ncontains some irritating substance that causes diarrhea. Except for the\r\npecan which gave rather low utilization, the protein of nuts was\r\ndigested to a high degree that compares most favorably with our ordinary\r\nfoodstuffs.\r\n\r\nHow then explain the undoubted discomforture that many people experience\r\nafter eating nuts? I believe that the explanation rests on the fact that\r\nour common American way of eating nuts, is not the rational way. We\r\nwould not consider topping off a heavy meal with eggs, meats or cereals\r\nor to eat these in large quantities between meals realizing that we are\r\nexposing ourselves to possible digestive discomfort. No more then, can\r\nwe expect to so eat nuts which are even more concentrated or \"heavy\"\r\nthan meat or eggs without occasional discomfort. Unpleasant results from\r\nso eating does not condemn the nuts as indigestible, rather it condemns\r\nour mode of using that nut. Further, we must recognize that the nut is a\r\nhard, compact substance and that unless completely masticated, is not\r\nreadily penetrated by the digestive juices of the alimentary canal. This\r\nwas very well brought out in our experiment with dogs. The dog bolts his\r\nfood and where there were large fragments of the nut in the food, they\r\nappeared almost unchanged in the feces, while if the nut is ground fine\r\nbefore feeding, it was readily digested. Comparisons of nut butters and\r\nnut pastes with the whole nut also brought out this point. The\r\ncompletely commuted nut butters showed consistently higher degrees of\r\ndigestion than the whole nut.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the starch rich chestnut, the heating of the nut\r\ndid not seem to effect the digestibility whether this heat was boiling,\r\nsteaming or roasting. The raw nut apparently is as well digested as the\r\nheated products. No differences were found between nut butters whether\r\nthe process involved steaming or roasting of the nut. I am not speaking\r\nof the enhancing of the flavor that heating may bring about, but only of\r\nthe digestibility.\r\n\r\nDr. Longworthy and his co-workers in the Dept. of Agriculture have\r\ninvestigated in recent years the digestibility of many vegetable oils,\r\namong them nut oils, and have found as high a percent of utilization\r\nwith these as with butter and our other common animal food fats.\r\n\r\nI believe that we are fully justified in the conclusion that nuts and\r\nnut products, if rationally used in our diets, are as digestible and\r\nfully as valuable from a nutritional point of view as our other\r\nfoodstuffs.\r\n\r\nWhile we can now definitely speak of the high digestibility of nuts, it\r\nis necessary to consider other phases of the part played by foods in\r\nnutrition. The fact that a food after being taken into the body can be\r\nbroken up by the digestive juices of the alimentary tract, and the\r\nproducts absorbed, as we have found, to be the case with the nuts, is\r\nnot the end of the story of the function of that food.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen years ago, it was discovered that during the progress of\r\ndigestion, the protein materials are reduced by the digestive juices of\r\nour stomachs and intestines to smaller chemical compounds, and that it\r\nis these smaller fragments of the protein molecule that are absorbed\r\ninto the blood and are used to build up our muscles and tissues. These\r\nfragments or \"building stones\" as they have been fancifully called, are\r\nall of a distant class of chemical compounds known to chemists as amino\r\nacids. Eighteen of these acids have been found as the products of\r\nprotein digestion.\r\n\r\nWe may conceive of our bodies as being continually supplied with a mass\r\nof these 18 building stones from which it selects the kind and number\r\nthat it needs to repair the everyday wear and tear of the tissues and in\r\nthe case of the growing child builds new structures.\r\n\r\nSince the date of this important discovery regarding the fate of\r\nindigested protein, it has been found that with few exceptions, the body\r\nis not able to manufacture these amino acids or to change one kind into\r\nanother, and must depend on the protein eaten, for a supply of the\r\nvarious kinds that go to make up the body protein. Further it has been\r\nfound, that many of our commonly used food proteins do not contain all\r\n18 of these amino acids components. In some foods one, two, and\r\nsometimes more are lacking, or if present are in very small amounts. If\r\nour diet contained only proteins of an inferior grade, we can picture\r\nour body requiring building stones of various kinds to maintain the\r\nstructure of the body and unable to obtain them due to the poor quality\r\nof the food, protein. Nutritional failure would be the result. The\r\nproteins then must be of the right quality as well as present in the\r\nproper quantities, to prevent mal-nutrition. Bearing in mind these\r\nfacts, it is necessary in studying a food such as our nuts, to determine\r\nthe kind of protein the individual nut contains as well as to know\r\nwhether or not it can be digested by the body.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years, it has been found that we must have in our\r\nfoods a certain amount of substances whose chemical nature is at present\r\nunknown and to which the name of vitamines has been given. It is not my\r\npurpose to discuss with you the many phases of vitamines and their\r\nrelation to nutrition, but I only wish to impress upon you the fact that\r\nit is of the utmost importance for a dietary to contain these\r\nsubstances; fully as important as that the protein, fat, carbohydrate,\r\nand inorganic salt content shall be satisfactory. Lack of these\r\nvitamines brings on various evidences of mal-nutrition. One vitamine\r\nwhich is found in animal fats and the leaves of plants and is soluble\r\nin, and associated with fats, is, for that reason, called fat soluble\r\nvitamine. Another called the water soluble vitamine is widely\r\ndistributed in cereal seeds, vegetables, and legumes. The third, the\r\nso-called antiscorbutic vitamine because of its action as preventative\r\nand cure for scurvy, is found in certain fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\nWe then ask the next question: Are nuts adequate as far as their\r\nproteins contain these essential amino acids, and do nuts contain\r\nvitamines? That is, is their biological value as satisfactory as their\r\ndigestibility?\r\n\r\nDr. Hoobler of Detroit, in a study of the diets of lactating mothers and\r\nwet nurses, a year or so ago, compared the value of proteins from animal\r\nand vegetable sources for the elaboration of milk. He found that a\r\nmixture of the almond, English walnut, peanut and pecan, furnished\r\nproteins that were equal to the animal food tried, and far superior to\r\nother vegetable proteins. Here then is evidence that nuts provide the\r\nnecessary building stones to form milk that food par excellence for the\r\nnewly born individual. Drs. Mendel and Osborn, experimenting on white\r\nrats have shown that the principle proteins of the Brazil nut will\r\nmaintain animals through the growing period. Bureau of Chemistry workers\r\nand others have found similar results with the coconut and the peanut. I\r\nhave now, experiments underway at New Haven, on the biological value of\r\nthe filbert, English walnut, pine nut, almond, and pecan. While these\r\ntests are yet incompleted, it can at least be said that to date there is\r\nno evidence that the proteins of these nuts are in any way less\r\nsatisfactory than those of the peanut or Brazil nut that have been\r\nthoroughly tested out.\r\n\r\nAs to the vitamine content, abundant quantities of water soluble\r\nvitamine have been found in the peanut and the coconut. Experiments that\r\nwe have in progress as well as a series conducted here at Battle Creek\r\nunder Dr. Kellogg's direction give promise to increase this list of\r\nvitamine containing nuts to include at least many of our common nuts.\r\nAlong with our vegetable oils in general, coconut oil and peanut oil\r\ncontain insufficient quantities of the fat soluble vitamine to maintain\r\ngrowth in young animals. Whether the other nut oils will prove more\r\nefficacious in this respect, is now under investigation. As far as I am\r\naware, the antiscorbutic properties of nuts have not been studied.\r\n\r\nWith the population of the world on a steady increase, it continually\r\nbecomes necessary for mankind to seek out new sources of food, and\r\nutilize products that formerly had received little attention as possible\r\nfoods. Conditions that disturb normal food production and distribution,\r\nsuch for example as were brought about by the world war, produce serious\r\nfood shortages in the world, and emphasize how close is the margin that\r\ndetermines whether the peoples of the world have adequate quantities of\r\nfood or whether they are faced by shortages, and, in many cases, by\r\nstarvation. In this continual development of our food resources, nuts\r\nstand out prominently as offering possibilities which are very great.\r\nNot only do they represent a very concentrated form of food which is\r\nhighly digestible, but they possess a number of characteristic and\r\nhighly pleasing flavors that recommends them for use in all manner of\r\nculinary procedures. The variety of uses to which nuts can be put in the\r\nkitchen is amply demonstrated right here in Dr. Kellogg's sanitarium and\r\nI feel sure that even he has not exhausted the possibilities of nuts in\r\nthe dietary. The forms of nut products on the market are steadily\r\nincreasing. The nut butters, nut pastes, nut margarines, meat\r\nsubstitutes, and so forth, all point to the variety of ways that nuts\r\ncan be handled as foods.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous increase in the use of nut oils in the form of the oil\r\nitself and as nut margarines within the last few years is a striking\r\nexample of the utilization on a large scale of relatively new food\r\nproducts. The press cake which remains as a by-product of this oil\r\nindustry finds ready use as concentrates for cattle feeds. Many of our\r\nideas in the feeding of our domestic animals are undergoing development\r\nalong with the idea of human nutrition. Just recently, investigators at\r\nthe Wisconsin Experiment Station, reported that the well known \"home\r\ngrown ration\" for dairy cows that consist of cereals, silage and hay, is\r\nnot a large milk producing diet. Their recommendation is to supplement\r\nthis ration with protein concentrates. Nut meals recommend themselves\r\nmost highly as protein concentrates. It certainly is safe to say that\r\nthe day when the fruits of our nut bearing trees will be allowed to fall\r\nungathered from the trees, is at an end.\r\n\r\nThere are many problems that still call for an answer by the chemist and\r\ndietitian. The nutritive value of the individual nuts should be firmly\r\nestablished in all its phases. The causes that have made the use of\r\ncertain nuts unprofitable commercially, should be studied with the view\r\nof correcting these stumbling blocks. For example, the freeing of the\r\nhorse-chestnut from its poisonous saponins and enable us to use this\r\nstarch rich nut as food is well within the range of possibility as\r\nindicated by experiments conducted in Austria during the war. Why do nut\r\noils tend to become rancid easily and can this tendency be remedied? Is\r\nthe freeing of the acorn and its tannin and other objectionable\r\nsubstances a practical consideration? What is the irritating principle\r\nof the English walnut?\r\n\r\nAll these problems and many others wait solution. Research on nuts is in\r\nprogress in many places. It involves time consuming experiments that are\r\noften times expensive. As a result, progress is slow, the amount of\r\nresearch being limited by the financial factor. The value of the pecan\r\nnut crop alone of the year 1918, was over 91 million dollars and the\r\nvalue of the imports and exports of nuts and nut products during the\r\nsame year amounted to over 51 million dollars. If one one-hundredth of\r\none per cent of this sum should be devoted by those interested in the\r\ndevelopment of our nut industry in this country for the study of the\r\nnutritional and chemical properties of nuts, I feel sure that they would\r\nbe amply repaid for their investment.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I believe this will complete our program for\r\ntonight. We have quite a full program for tomorrow morning. Mr. C. A.\r\nReed, nut culturist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, is with us\r\nand was to have been on the program tonight, but he has been busy all\r\nday and was hardly ready for tonight's program, as he has been busy\r\ngetting the exhibit in order, and he will be on the program tomorrow\r\nmorning, and three or four others, among them Dr Kellogg, I believe, so\r\nthat there will be quite a full morning's program, and we will be glad\r\nto have all of you come who can. We meet in the parlor of the Annex at\r\nten o'clock tomorrow morning. If any one desires to join the Association\r\nand will speak to the secretary, he will give yow the necessary\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nEND OF TUESDAY EVENING SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1919, 10:00 A.M.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT W. C. REED IN THE CHAIR\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Mr. O. C. Simonds of Chicago will talk to you\r\non \"Nut Trees in Landscape work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT TREES AND BUSHES IN LANDSCAPE WORK\r\n\r\nO. C. SIMONDS, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering material for landscape work the places that come to mind\r\nwhere such work would be required are home grounds, highways, parks,\r\ncemeteries, school grounds, city squares and woods. The highways would\r\ninclude city streets, parkways, usually called boulevards, and country\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nAll trees are beautiful and should serve in some place in landscape\r\nwork. Some_are more beautiful than others and where but few trees can be\r\nused the more beautiful would naturally be chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WALNUTS\r\n\r\nNot long ago, a lawyer was talking to me about the beauty of black\r\nwalnuts. To his mind there is no tree more beautiful and from what he\r\nsaid, he would use it almost to the exclusion of other trees. My own\r\njudgment does not fully coincide with his although I consider a black\r\nwalnut a very attractive tree. It grows to a large size and is generally\r\nhealthy. Its shape is good and the foliage attractive in summer. The\r\nleaves drop early and they are not especially attractive in autumn\r\ncoloring. Black walnuts are strong in appearance. They lack the\r\ngracefulness of the elm and if I were making a list of trees in the\r\norder of their appearance, placing the most beautiful first and the\r\nleast attractive last, I should place several trees ahead of the black\r\nwalnut, among them sugar maples, elms and several of the oaks. Perhaps\r\nthe black walnut would come about in the center of the list for most\r\nlocations. The list itself would vary for different situations and\r\nclimates. I should advise using black walnuts plentifully along the\r\nhighways, especially country roads, and somewhat sparingly in home\r\ngrounds and the other locations which I have named. By plentifully, I\r\ndo not mean to the exclusion of other trees, for, in some places, there\r\nshould be more elms and maples than black walnuts, but highways are so\r\nextensive that many kinds of trees could be used in abundance to give\r\nshade. In woods there are places where black walnuts could be used in\r\nprofusion.\r\n\r\nThe objections that one might raise to the use of black walnuts would\r\nbe, first, the comparatively short season of the leaves. These come out\r\nrather late in the spring and drop early, probably these trees can not\r\nbe improved very much in this respect. Second, boys will sometimes throw\r\nsticks at the trees to bring down the nuts. If a boy comes in home\r\ngrounds to do this, he will be considered a nuisance. Branches are\r\nsometimes broken and the trees disfigured from this cause. Along\r\nhighways this objection might perhaps be lessened somewhat by planting\r\nenough trees so that there would be more nuts than the boy would want,\r\nor by improving the manner of the boy. Third, the trees are often\r\nattacked by caterpillars. This objection can usually be obviated by\r\nspraying or destroying the pests in other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERNUTS\r\n\r\nThe remarks made about the black walnut would apply in many ways to the\r\nbutternut, its nearest relative. Butternuts have a range extending\r\nfurther north and they are more subject to disease than the black\r\nwalnuts. Like the walnut, their leaves come out late and drop early.\r\nThey are subject to the attacks of boys. When healthy, they are\r\nattractive in appearance and they deserve to be planted in most places\r\nwhere trees are used for landscape effect, but in the list I suggested,\r\nthey would come below the black walnut.\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKORIES\r\n\r\nThere is a time of the year when the shagbark, which produces such sweet\r\nnuts, would be more attractive than any neighboring tree. It is when the\r\nbig buds swell and send out yellowish green leaves surrounded by large,\r\nred bracts. At this time they are as showy and as beautiful as any\r\nflowers. The bracts soon fall, but the leaves turn a rich green and are\r\nattractive until early fall, when they are sometimes yellow, and\r\nsometimes drop without any marked coloring. The trunk of the hickory is\r\nunique in appearance as the bark separates from the tree in long\r\nplatelike strips which hang on at one end and give the scraggly\r\nappearance from which the tree derives its name. All of the hickories\r\nare attractive in appearance, but some of them drop their leaves early.\r\nThe hickories are difficult to transplant but this is nothing against\r\nthe beauty of the tree. An established tree is more valuable on this\r\naccount. In some places hickories are quite subject to disease or to the\r\nattacks of borers. Like the walnuts, hickories which produce edible nuts\r\nare subject to the attacks of boys, but, on account of the toughness of\r\nthe wood and the roughness of the bark, they are usually quite able to\r\nwithstand these attacks. Hickories are suitable for use in all landscape\r\nwork so far as their appearance is concerned. The fact that they are not\r\nso used is due to the difficulty of transplanting them. In the fall when\r\na maple tree has colored up beautifully and a hickory near it has\r\ndropped its leaves, we are apt to compare the two unfavorably to the\r\nlatter, but we should remember the appearance in summer and especially\r\nwhen the leaves first unfold. Hickory trees are beautiful also when the\r\nleaves are off, their branches making beautiful etchings against the sky\r\nin winter. The pecan, which is the largest of all hickories, is an\r\nexception to the general rule because it is planted quite extensively,\r\nespecially in the South. It is a beautiful tree and where it is hardy\r\nthere is no reason why it should not be used as a street tree, a tree in\r\nhome grounds, in parks, or any other place where deciduous trees are\r\nneeded. It is raised extensively in some nurseries, while the other\r\nhickories are raised very sparingly, and some not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEECH\r\n\r\nSome would consider the beech the most beautiful of all nut trees. Its\r\ncomparatively smooth, bluish-gray bark makes it a distinctive tree at\r\nall seasons. Its branches, spreading straight out from the trunk, give\r\nit an appearance of strength. Its fine branches form a specially\r\npleasing skyline, its sharp buds are trim and neat in appearance, its\r\nleaves are beautiful in shape and texture. Their fall coloring, while\r\nnot as brilliant as that of the maples, is really beautiful, being\r\neither yellow or a rich brown. The leaves are apt to hang on all winter,\r\nespecially on the younger growth, and then they often turn a straw\r\ncolor. If a list of beautiful trees for February were to be made, I am\r\nrather inclined to think that the beech would stand at the head of the\r\nlist. A young beech with its bluish-gray bark, its straw colored leaves,\r\nand flecks of snow here and there, seems to me the most beautiful of all\r\ndeciduous trees in winter. The young leaves also are especially\r\nattractive when they first appear and the blossoms are sometimes objects\r\nof interest, although not showy in color.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZELNUTS\r\n\r\nOften in old pastures one finds forlorn, scraggly looking bushes and is\r\ntold they are hazelnut bushes. One would not pick out bushes like these\r\nto plant in his front yard, and yet, when given a chance, there is\r\nscarcely a more attractive shrub than the hazel. It is one of the first\r\nshrubs to blossom, the staminate flowers hanging in slender, graceful\r\nyellowish-brown catkins, while the pistillate flowers are little points\r\nof purplish-red protruding from the buds. These blossoms appear long\r\nbefore the leaves. The latter, when fully developed, are beautiful in\r\noutline and soft in texture and they have a rich coloring in the fall\r\nincluding various shades of yellow and red. The hazel should certainly\r\nbe used extensively in landscape work. The nuts, with their leaflike\r\ninvolucres, are attractive in appearance in August and September. In\r\nconnection with our own hazel one would naturally think of the filbert,\r\nwhich is a European relative. The filbert is often planted for ornament.\r\nThere is a variety with purple leaves which some people admire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OAKS\r\n\r\nOf all our native trees, I think the oak excels in beauty of foliage. By\r\nmany oaks might not be considered nut trees, but nearly all of the\r\nacorns are eaten by squirrels or other wild animals and so I think it\r\nwould be proper to mention oaks when speaking of nut trees in the\r\nlandscape. In the northern states we have two groups known as the white\r\noak group and the red oak group. The trees of the former have soft, dull\r\ngreen leaves with rounded lobes, while those of the latter have shiny\r\nleaves with lobes ending in points of filaments. The former mature their\r\nacorns in one year, while the latter require two years to bring them to\r\nmaturity. The acorns of the white group are sweet, while those of the\r\nred group are more or less bitter. The foliage of all oaks is attractive\r\nwhen it first appears, the small leaves varying in color from almost\r\nwhite through pink, yellow, and red to the deepest purple. Perhaps the\r\nred oak excels all other trees in the beauty of its summer foliage and\r\nits leaves are also richly colored in autumn. The Bur Oak, in addition\r\nto having attractive foliage, has a rough, dark bark that gives it an\r\nattractive appearance in winter. The white oak, especially when young,\r\nholds many of its leaves in spring and these with their brown color,\r\ngive a warmth to the snowy landscape. One could make a most beautiful\r\npark by planting nothing but oaks and they should rank with maples and\r\nelms as street trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUTS\r\n\r\nThere is a tree which a few years ago would have been considered along\r\nwith the oak in landscape work, but which now would not be thought of in\r\ncertain regions on account of a disease which has practically destroyed\r\nit. This tree is the American chestnut. It grows to a large size, and if\r\nit were not for this disease, would be worthy of a place in any park.\r\nHundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent without success in\r\nendeavoring to exterminate the disease. Some of the introduced varieties\r\nare apparently exempt from this disease, but only the future can tell\r\nwhether the chestnut will again become valuable in landscape work as\r\nwell as in the raising of food and lumber.\r\n\r\nIn designing landscapes, we think first of open spaces and then bound\r\nthese spaces with trees and shrubs having pleasing shapes and foliage.\r\nThe tops of these trees form the skyline and the lower growth a margin\r\nof lawns, or perhaps of walks and drives. For these purposes the\r\nbeeches, hickories, hazels, walnuts and butternuts are all valuable,\r\ntheir value being approximately in the order named.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE CHESTNUTS AND BUCKEYES\r\n\r\nThere may be some question about including these in a list of nut trees.\r\nI understand, however, that the seeds of all of these trees have been\r\nused for feeding stock and perhaps some way may be found for making them\r\navailable as food for men and women. There is no question about their\r\nusefulness for ornamental trees. In Europe, the horse chestnut has been\r\nused extensively for park and boulevard planting and it is also largely\r\nused in the United States. There are several varieties. The leaves\r\nappear early, the blossoms coming out later. Our own buckeyes are\r\nhandsome in appearance and all are adapted for use in landscape work.\r\n\r\nThe arguments for and against the use of nut trees in landscape work\r\nwould be somewhat similar to such arguments regarding fruit trees. A\r\nluscious fruit tree like the snow apple, would be omitted from the list\r\nof trees for the park, not because it lacks beauty, but because its\r\nfruit would lead to its destruction. Apple trees might, however, be very\r\nappropriate for private grounds. They have sometimes given a name to a\r\nhome, as \"The Orchard\". The same is true of certain nut trees, \"Walnut\r\nHill,\" and \"Hickory Grove\" being not uncommon. The hazel, too, is\r\nfrequently used in naming home grounds, streets or localities. A name\r\nwould not be used in this way unless the object bearing it was held in\r\nesteem. I am glad there is an association to encourage the raising of\r\nnut trees and I hope to see such trees used in this way extensively, for\r\nthe purpose of developing attractive scenery as well as for food\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nMR SIMONDS: When Mr. Bixby asked me to prepare a paper and come\r\nhere and read it, I wrote back I would prepare a paper and send to him\r\nto read; and afterwards Mr. Reed came to see me, and knowing that he\r\nwould be here, I concluded I would come. I dictated a paper and\r\nafterwards I found I had left out a few nut trees, and I want to speak\r\njust a word regarding those before I read my paper. One of those is the\r\ncoconut palm. I was thinking more particularly of trees in this locality\r\nwhen I dictated the paper; but the coconut tree aside from raising the\r\ncoconuts, I think is the most magnificent palm that we have. There are\r\nother trees that some like better, but I think the coconut palm is the\r\nmost picturesque, the finest tree to plant. I prefer it to the other\r\nlarge palms. It has great spreading leaves, sometimes fifteen or twenty\r\nfeet long, a feathery top, and the trunk is not quite straight, and I\r\nlike it a little better because it is not. Then here is the English\r\nwalnut. I did not speak in my paper about the English walnut, but there\r\nis a tree that is a beautiful tree, and where it is hardy it should of\r\ncourse be planted for ornament as well as for the nuts. And then there\r\nis the almond which we do not have here as a nut tree, but which they\r\nhave in California, which has some attractions, and might be planted,\r\nalthough it is really not so ornamental as some of the nut trees; still\r\nit is worth planting. (Applause).\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Are there any questions you would like to ask\r\nMr. Simonds while he is with us, or is there any discussion?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: There are two or three points for discussion. Mr.\r\nSimonds does not think highly of the almond. I do for decorative\r\npurposes. When I drive in my driveway at Stamford and face that\r\nmagnificent blaze of blazing clouds of almonds in the springtime, I\r\nthink it is something worth while; it is the hard shelled almond. It\r\nwill grow as far north as the peach does. The only trouble is they are a\r\nlittle more subject to leaf blight and need a little more attention. But\r\nwhere the peach will grow you can raise the almond profitably. Among the\r\nhazel nuts the most beautiful of the entire series is the tree hazel\r\nthat grows about as large as the smaller oaks, and that is said to bear\r\ntwenty-five or thirty bushels of hazelnuts a year,--enormous crops. That\r\nis perfectly hardy here, and the beauty of the tree is such that I\r\nbelieve it to be a very important addition. I would like to hear Mr.\r\nJones' opinion on that point. I use it for grafting purposes for other\r\nhazels. The Japanese walnuts, almost tropical in their rapid growth,\r\nsometimes grow six feet in a year in rich ground, and with their great\r\nsprays of leaves sometimes a yard in length, and the seedballs of the\r\nheart nut variety give really a tropical appearance to the grounds where\r\nthe ground is rich enough. They will grow almost any place, but in rich\r\nground they are certainly very wonderful. Among the chestnuts, of\r\ncourse, we have a number of hybrids now that resist blight very well;\r\nand the little chinkapins for lawn bushes are very attractive. One of\r\nour most beautiful chestnuts is splendid for a lawn specimen and is\r\nevergreen in the South. When I was a boy I never had plums enough; so\r\none of my ambitions was to have plums enough so I could see some of them\r\nrot on the ground. We can do the same thing with nut trees--have nuts\r\nenough so the boys will be full and have nuts enough. It seems to me it\r\nought to be one of our ambitions to have so many nut trees along the\r\nroadsides in the parks, etc., that the boys and the squirrels can not\r\nuse them all up.\r\n\r\nMR. SIMONDS: I think the Doctor is right in some of his\r\ncriticisms. In fact, the almond is something like a peach, and I had not\r\nprized it for use in landscape work so very much on account of certain\r\ndiseases which would be apt to affect it here if it were not taken care\r\nof as we would take care of trees in an orchard. The hazel tree, of\r\ncourse, would be attractive if it is hardy here. I have had doubts about\r\nits being hardy because of its coming from southern Europe.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: It is hardy in all Canada. They have fine tree\r\nhazels in the park at Rochester. They have there probably the largest\r\ntree hazels in the country.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: I would like to have more questions asked. I\r\nfeel as though I had accomplished a real achievement in getting Mr.\r\nSimonds here. I was under him a short time a number of years ago and\r\nlearned something of his skill as a landscape gardener and the\r\nreputation that he has; and I felt that we could not hope to have a\r\nbetter authority on these points that he has discussed than we could in\r\nMr. Simonds; and it is something that is constantly coming up. The\r\nDepartment of Agriculture have to consider that people want to know what\r\ntrees they can plant in the landscape; and I feel particularly glad to\r\nhave Mr. Simonds here.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: It seems to me we ought to talk more about the\r\nnut-bearing pines in the landscape, because where you are planting pine\r\ntrees, you might as well plant the nut-bearing kind as the others; they\r\nare just as beautiful, and you combine the Greek idea of beauty and\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nMR. SIMONDS: Certainly, that is a tree I have omitted, because\r\nin this region we have not had any nuts.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: There are four pines that will bear nuts here--the\r\nKorean pine, the pignolia or stone pine, the Italian stone pine and the\r\nSwiss both. There are five nut bearing pine trees that are all market\r\ntrees for nuts, that I know will grow and bear here, including the lace\r\nbark pine.\r\n\r\nMR. SIMONDS: Are they raising nuts in Michigan on pines?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: No, but they might. Those five kinds would grow\r\nhere and bear nuts here, so they have a double value.\r\n\r\nMR. SIMONDS: I think we ought to raise them. Of course they are\r\nbeautiful in the landscape.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: The whole idea of your paper is to approach the\r\nGreek ideal--add utility to beauty.\r\n\r\nMR. SIMONDS: That is what nature does. It makes beautiful\r\nleaves, then uses the leaves for plant food.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: I wonder, Dr. Morris, if you can tell where\r\nthese pines can be had.\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: The Korean pine is from northeast Asia, and you can\r\nget those from the original pine seed; the lace bark pine is from\r\nnortheastern Asia where the climate is like ours. The Swiss stone pine\r\nand the Italian stone pine are from Switzerland and Italy and closely\r\nrelated--both excellent trees. The fruit now you buy as the pignolia in\r\nthe markets. Both those are sold as pignolia nuts. It is a commercial\r\nnut of Europe. The white barked pine you would get from the West. It has\r\na beautiful fine large nut, and you would get that from any Pacific\r\ncoast dealers in nut trees.\r\n\r\nMR. SIMMONDS: Has that another name?\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: I do not know of any other name for it. Wait: The\r\nsingle leaved pine is one. That grows so far north on the Pacific, but\r\nwe do not know whether it will ripen its nuts here or not. It is\r\nperfectly hardy here and would be a beautiful nut tree, grows well. The\r\nsingle-leaved pine--that is _monophylla_. There are four or five pinons\r\nthat will live, but they do not grow fast enough to make it worth while\r\nto raise them in Michigan. The Jeffrey bull pine is another one that\r\nwill grow here and bear fruit, with a beautiful blue-green foliage. The\r\nJeffrey bull pine is one of the most beautiful and thrifty pines. That\r\nis the Jeffrey variety of ponderosa. The nut is very much larger than\r\nthe nut of the ordinary ponderosa. The nut of the ponderosa is small,\r\nbut the Indians use them and eat them, shell and all. When we come to\r\nusing the pines more freely for food purposes, we are going to do what\r\nthey do in Europe with some of the small seeded pines--crush them and\r\nmake a mass, squeeze the cream out from the nuts, dry it a little, and\r\nthat makes very fine rich cream; then the residue is given to the\r\nchickens and pigs. There are in all about thirty pine trees now that are\r\nused for market purposes where they fruit, and we will undoubtedly\r\nincrease that number. I do not doubt that fifty species of pine trees\r\nwill be planted for their fruit by two generations from now when we feel\r\nthe need more.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: We will be glad to have questions from any one.\r\nI think we get more from the discussions than we do from the papers.\r\n\r\nVOICE: In regard to the hickory nut, the shagbark, back in\r\nnortheastern Ohio, four years ago we had quite serious trouble with\r\nour hickories there along in the month of June, about the time we get\r\nthe common June bug, there was a large bug that looked like the June bug\r\nthat seemed to work at night mostly. We did not see them active in the\r\nday time, but they ate the foliage entirely off the lower branches and\r\nthose limbs from which they ate the foliage died. In some cases, the\r\ntree died. I would like to know if anyone knows anything about those.\r\nThat was new to me. I have had opportunity to answer all sorts of\r\nquestions about that. I have been asked I guess by a thousand different\r\npeople about that insect, and I have not been able to learn anything\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nMR. SIMONDS: I can not tell you.\r\n\r\nSAME VOICE: One man told me when he knew I was coming here,\r\n\"For goodness sakes find out something about that if you can.\"\r\n\r\nDR. MORRIS: It probably is the June bug, and turkeys and ducks\r\nwould solve the problem.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: The only suggestion I would make is that in\r\nOhio you have one of the best posted authorities on nut insects there is\r\nin the country. That is Prof. H. A. Gossard, at Wooster. If he can not\r\ntell you about it, no one can.\r\n\r\nMR. J. F. JONES: I think it is no doubt it is the ordinary May\r\nbeetle that is doing the mischief.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I might say we had quite a deluge of beetles\r\nalong that line in the nursery a year ago this last June, the first time\r\nwe have ever been bothered with them. They finally became so thick we\r\nhad to go through and shake the trees and shake them off. They looked\r\nsomething like the May beetle, only smaller, hard shelled, and seemed to\r\ncome by the millions; but they only lasted a few days, and it was all\r\nover, and we have never seen them since.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: There is one more question I would like to ask\r\nMr. Simonds, and that is in regard to the proper distance for spacing\r\nnut trees along avenues and in parks.\r\n\r\nMR. SIMONDS: I think that in both of those situations it is\r\nwell to give the trees a natural appearance by grouping, and sometimes\r\nthey can be far apart, and sometimes I think there might be a group of\r\ntwo or three close together, so that they would grow in one group. That\r\nwill give a more natural arrangement in parks, and we have room enough\r\nalong the sides of most of our highways to have the same effect there.\r\nThe policy to be pursued with regard to spacing nut trees along highways\r\nwould be the same that we would follow in planting any other trees, and\r\none of the most attractive streets I know is now in the city of Grand\r\nRapids; it used to be in the country when I lived there years ago; but\r\nalong the sides of that street there are native trees, mostly burr oaks,\r\nand they have grown just as nature planted them. There will be a group\r\nof two or three, then a space, may be a single tree, then there may be a\r\ngroup of five or six; and that natural arrangement is really beautiful,\r\nto me far more beautiful than a straight row of trees, uniform spaced.\r\nOn that same street sixty or seventy years ago my uncle planted where\r\nthere were no trees--it is a continuation of this street--rows of sugar\r\nmaples, and they grew and finally made splendid trees, and a great storm\r\ncame along and broke down two or three, and that was a source of great\r\nregret to my uncle; but his son thinks, perhaps, it was a good thing,\r\nbecause it opened a beautiful view out into the country. Now by grouping\r\ntrees we can save beautiful views. If we plant uniformly, we get\r\nmonotony. With this belt of burr oaks spaced as I have described, you\r\nhave variety on your sky line. Some trees are a little farther up than\r\nothers and catch the sunlight, and we get shade and light. That is the\r\nway I should plant nut trees. If I were planting black walnuts or\r\nbutternuts I would group them, but see that the tree has in some\r\ndirections space enough to develop as far as it wishes.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: Mr. Simonds is about to go. That is the reason\r\nI precipitated this question at this point. It was asked with reference\r\nto the law which these gentlemen, sitting at my right here, were\r\nresponsible in putting through in the legislature of this\r\nState--provision for planting food trees along the highways; and it may\r\nbe before Mr. Simonds goes, they have something further to ask.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: These questions are very important to draw out\r\ninformation. Is there anything else you wish to ask before we leave this\r\ntopic? If not, we will call on C. A. Reed to present his paper next. It\r\nwas carried over from last night, I believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT CULTURE IN MICHIGAN\r\n\r\nC. A. REED, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is evidence on all sides that the people of Michigan are deeply\r\ninterested in nut culture. Some have invested in pecan lands in the Far\r\nSouth; no doubt some own Persian (English) walnut, almond or filbert\r\norchards on the Pacific Coast; and others are at the point of planting\r\nnut trees in Michigan. Everybody would go nutting in fall if he could.\r\nMichigan leads all other northern states in what its institutions and\r\nsome of its people have done toward developing the nut industry.\r\n\r\nSome thirty years ago the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad\r\nCompany showed its interest in nut production, when it planted many\r\nmiles of chestnut trees along its tracks running north from Adrian.\r\nBetween 1888 and 1892 there were planted on the grounds of the\r\nsub-experiment station at South Haven, a number of pecan trees of Iowa\r\nand Missouri seed, Japanese walnuts, a number of filbert plants and a\r\ncollection of almond varieties. At about the same time, Prof L. H.\r\nBailey set out half dozen pecans and Japanese walnut trees on the campus\r\nof the Michigan Agricultural College. Later, Professor L. R. Taft added\r\nseveral seedling Persian (English) walnut trees to the group.\r\n\r\nIn traveling over the southern part of Michigan, one cannot go far\r\nwithout seeing signs of interest in nut trees. Everywhere the black\r\nwalnut has been spared or planted. In certain sections it is to be found\r\nabout practically every farm house or at least near enough by to furnish\r\nthe winter supply of the family nuts. The chestnut is less common in any\r\npart of the state than is the black walnut, not appearing to any\r\nconsiderable extent except in the lower southeastern corner. It has not\r\nfared well in the state either as a native or planted tree. The Persian\r\nor so-called English walnut has attracted considerable attention from\r\ntime to time, and under especially favorable surroundings one\r\noccasionally finds thrifty specimen trees. The pecan, the Japanese\r\nwalnut, European hazel or more popularly called the \"filbert\" have all\r\nbeen given limited trials at various times. Even the almond has had a\r\nday in Michigan. Quite possibly the pistache has been through the same\r\nexperience; but if so, the fact is not generally known. That species is\r\nfrom arid Asia and wholly unlikely to succeed in the latitude of\r\nMichigan although a young tree of a Chinese species ornamental because\r\nof its fine feathery foliage, green in summer but which takes on a\r\nbrilliant hue in fall is, or was the last we know, doing well on the\r\nprivate grounds of Dr. Robert T. Morris, near Stamford, Conn.\r\n\r\nAmong the kinds of nut trees from which we can select varieties for\r\nplanting in Michigan, there are eleven or more distinct species. With\r\nsuch a range as this, one might ask, why not go into nut growing in\r\nMichigan on the same scale as in the growing of apples and peaches.\r\nThere are probably better reasons why this is not being done, but two\r\nvery good ones are that there are not enough available trees of good\r\nvarieties to plant more than a single orchard of respectable size in the\r\nstate; and the other; it would not pay to put good Michigan land to nut\r\ntrees of such varieties as are now available even though they could be\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nIf nut trees can't be had and wouldn't pay if they could then why\r\npublish an article on \"Nuts for Michigan Planting,\" is probably what\r\nwill run through the minds of most readers of these lines. It is\r\ncertainly a logical question, but there are at least ten reasons why nut\r\ntrees should be planted in Michigan.\r\n\r\n1. The forests of Michigan have reached the point of depletion such that\r\nfor the sake of future generations, trees of some kind other than fruit\r\nmust be planted.\r\n\r\n2. While planting, we may as well select those capable of performing\r\nmore than a single service; in other words, trees of maximum possible\r\nuse. Oaks, poplars, ashes, pines, elms, etc., all have their places, but\r\nnot one in the group can produce anything of food value to humankind.\r\n\r\n3. Nut trees of most kinds, rightly used, are valuable for timber\r\npurposes and are very effective in the landscape.\r\n\r\n4. Members of the walnut family including the hickories are especially\r\nappropriate along the highways and city streets. They are sturdy,\r\nlong-lived and not easily damaged by storms or neighbor's boys.\r\n\r\n5. Nuts are among the very best of the meat substitutes. They contain\r\nmuch of the same food elements as do meats, although in different\r\nproportions. Some contain starch and to that extent can be used as are\r\nthe cereals and Irish potatoes. Nuts are the only vegetable product\r\ngrown in Michigan, which in raw condition afford a complete and fairly\r\nwell balanced food for human beings. Every pound of nut food that can be\r\nraised from a tree along the street or in the fence corner on the farm\r\nis clear gain, and that much added to our national food supply.\r\n\r\n6. Nuts are rapidly assuming importance as factors in the lists of\r\nAmerican foods.\r\n\r\n7. Many species of nut trees are adapted to some parts of Michigan. By\r\nplanting the best that are now available, and by constantly being on the\r\nlookout for better sorts, superior varieties will be certain to develop\r\nin a short while, the same as has been the case with all older orchard\r\nfruits and farm crops.\r\n\r\n8. Whoever intelligently plants nut trees performs a distinct public\r\nservice. He will receive the gratitude of more than the present\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n9. Among all kinds of trees, none are more appropriate for memorial\r\npurposes to the men who did not come back from France, than is the black\r\nwalnut. That species itself took a valiant part in warfare. It furnished\r\nmaterial for gunstocks the same as in previous wars, but in the World\r\nWar it rendered what was considered by eminent authority, a greater\r\nservice in supplying propellors for aeroplanes. The shells of the nuts\r\ncontributed their part toward the making of carbon for gas masks, and no\r\none knows the extent to which walnut kernels made up the delicacies sent\r\nfrom home to the boys in the trenches. With such a service record as\r\nthis, the black walnut is entitled to a memorial of its own. Its value\r\nas a timber tree, as an ornamental, and as a food producer, together\r\nwith its great range of adaptability from North to South and East to\r\nWest, should justly entitle it to recognition as a National tree.\r\n\r\n10. Michigan has a law providing for the planting of nut trees along its\r\nhighways. Thus, the state has officially put its approval on the idea\r\nand has become a leader in the encouragement of this great kind of\r\neconomy and thrift. It has taken a step toward conservation in a\r\ndirection which is highly developed in certain parts of Europe. The\r\nproduct is sold to the highest bidder and the income used in the upkeep\r\nof the road system. In that manner the roadways of those sections take\r\ncare of themselves. In this country millions of dollars of state and\r\nfederal moneys are being used this year, (ending June 30, 1921), in the\r\nconstruction and upkeep of public roads.\r\n\r\nDesirable as it would be to accomplish these ends, it could not all be\r\ndone at once. Even though there were an abundance of available trees of\r\ntried kinds, it would take a long time to plant them and to care for\r\nthem until they might become of profitable bearing age, also public\r\nopinion would need to be remolded in order to insure their care and\r\nprotection. Still it can and will be done. The movement is already on;\r\nthe Michigan law began to operate soon after being passed, and the\r\nDivision of Forestry at the Agricultural College is raising the trees\r\nfor planting. Public opinion regarding the care of the trees and their\r\nproduct will take care of itself when the value of the trees and their\r\nproducts becomes apparent. Both in California and in Oregon not only nut\r\nbut fruit orchards and vineyards, grow beside the roadways with no\r\nprotection other than that of public opinion; and what has been done in\r\none part of the country can be done in others as well.\r\n\r\nThe eleven species referred to as being available for Michigan use are\r\nas follows: The almond, beechnut, butternut, chestnut, filbert, (hazel),\r\npecan, shagbark hickory, shellbark hickory, black walnut, Japanese\r\nwalnut, and the Persian or so-called English walnut.\r\n\r\nTaking these up in order we will consider first the\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND\r\n\r\nExcept as an ornamental, the almond does not offer a great deal for use\r\nin Michigan. It is sometimes said to be as hardy as the peach, but only\r\nas this refers to the tree and not to the fruit, is it true. Certain\r\nhardshell almonds edible, yet so inferior to the improved varieties as\r\nto have practically no market value, do sometimes succeed in lower\r\nMichigan but their value is limited to their beauty when in bloom and to\r\nthe production of a low grade product. In form and general appearance\r\nthese almonds are much like peach pits. Very often they contain much of\r\nthe same bitter taste of Prussic acid common to the kernel of the\r\nordinary peach. They are interesting to observe while growing especially\r\nas they begin to ripen. The covering outside the seed is thin and\r\nleathery and while ripening, splits and peels outward in curious\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only recognized variety of almond of this class which is\r\nknown to have fruited in the East is the Ridenhower from southern\r\nIllinois. Trees can be had from some of the nurserymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEECH\r\n\r\nOne of Michigan's noblest, hardiest, and most often abused trees is the\r\nAmerican beech. It is common from north to south. No tree is more\r\nhandsome and none, unless possibly it be the white birch, is so often\r\ndefaced. Dr. Robt. T. Morris, of New York City, reminds us that\r\naccording to the scriptures, man, genus _Homo_, is a finished product\r\nmade by and in the image of the Creator. A safe assumption is that the\r\nscriptural reference is not to the creature whose initials appear on the\r\ntrunk of a beech or whose knife has removed bark from white birch. His\r\ngenus is not _Homo_, and he is not scripturally recorded.\r\n\r\nThe beech is not directly important as a nut bearing tree, but\r\nindirectly it is as the nuts are rarely harvested. Indirectly it is of\r\ngreat value. No food is better for turkeys and hogs than are beechnuts.\r\nA bushel of beechnuts that can be used in this way replace at least a\r\nbushel of corn. The difference in cost of production should make\r\nbeechnuts worth several times as much as corn.\r\n\r\nIn Europe a valuable oil used as a drug and for salads is expressed from\r\nbeechnuts. Possibly individual trees could be found somewhere in\r\nMichigan which produce nuts large enough, good enough, and in quantity\r\nenough to justify their recognition and propagation as named varieties.\r\n\r\nNo matter whether distinct varieties appear or not, the beech is well\r\nworthy of planting in many places about both the farm and the city lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERNUT\r\n\r\nA member of the walnut family known also as \"long walnut\" and as \"white\r\nwalnut\" is the true butternut. It has a smaller range of adaptability\r\nthan does the black walnut but is found considerably farther north. On\r\nthe Atlantic coast, its native range extends into Nova Scotia. In parts\r\nof New York State and New England, it is one of the most common species.\r\nIt is well known in Michigan where, to many people it is the favorite of\r\nall nuts. The tree is less durable and long-lived than is the black\r\nwalnut. It is less well suited for use in the landscape and its timber\r\nvalue is probably the least of any native walnut.\r\n\r\nWithin very recent years one or two promising varieties have been\r\nintroduced by the nurserymen. The first and only one now available is\r\nthe Aiken from New Hampshire. The nut cracks well and the kernels are of\r\npleasant flavor, but as a variety it has not been tested long enough to\r\ndetermine its adaptability to conditions in other states nor the extent\r\nto which budded trees will be productive.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest, of all tree tragedies is represented by the\r\nchestnut. Once a dominant species in many parts of the East, it is now\r\nmerely a wreck of its former self. In whole states along the Atlantic\r\nSeaboard, it has been wiped out by a fungus disease introduced from\r\nJapan some 25 years ago. Pennsylvania allows no chestnut trees to be\r\nshipped outside its limits for fear of further spreading this disease.\r\nSo far as known chestnut trees from west of the Wabash River are free\r\nfrom infection. From Illinois, there have recently been introduced\r\nseveral varieties of chestnut supposedly of pure American parentage\r\nwhich are quite the equal in size of the European sorts but which have\r\nthe sweet flavor of true American strains. In protected places in the\r\nsouthern part of the Lower Peninsula these chestnuts should be well\r\nworthy of trial. They are, indeed, splendid chestnuts. The principal\r\nvarieties are the Rochester, Progress, Fuller and Boone. The last is not\r\nrelated to the others; but is the result of an artificial cross between\r\nthe American sweet chestnut and the Japan Giant.\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKORY\r\n\r\nNext to, or perhaps equal to the black walnut, the hickories are among\r\nthe best known of Michigan's nut trees. Belonging to the same family as\r\ndo the walnuts, they require much the same soil for their best\r\ndevelopment. They are slower of growth and even harder to bud and graft\r\nor to successfully transplant. Nevertheless, some of hickories bear\r\nsplendid nuts in liberal quantities. Quite a number of good varieties\r\nhave been named and a few propagated. They are mainly of the shagbark\r\nspecies although some are shellbarks, some pignuts, and a few hybrids.\r\nThe true shellbark is not found in Michigan and would probably not\r\nsucceed there as well as do others. In character of growth, the\r\nshellbark is much like the shagbark but the nuts are much larger, and\r\nthe shells extremely thick. Among the good shagbarks there are the\r\nSwaim, Weiker, Kentucky, Manahan, Taylor and Vest.\r\n\r\nTrue hickories ordinarily do not attain important habits of bearing\r\nuntil from 15 to 25 years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN\r\n\r\nThe pecan is easily the favorite and most important nut of American\r\norigin. Contrary to current ideas, it is not an introduced species nor\r\nare the best pecans grown in California. The pecan has become one of the\r\nleading nuts of this country by rapid but natural processes. In the\r\nforests, it is indigenous as far north as the southern part of Indiana,\r\nand in western Illinois it is found at the latitude of Chicago. Seedling\r\ntrees at South Haven and on the campus of Michigan Agricultural College\r\nhave borne occasional crops but the climate of Michigan is too severe\r\nfor pecans to bear regularly. The trees of northern origin should do\r\nwell enough over much of lower Michigan to be worthy of planting. Good\r\nvarieties are the Major, Greenriver, Niblack, Indiana, Busseron and\r\nPosey.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WALNUT\r\n\r\nAlready the black walnut had been referred to in this article. In its\r\nfurther behalf may be said that like the pecan it is one of America's\r\nmost rapid growing valuable trees. It does not grow with the speed of a\r\npoplar, a willow, or a linden. Neither does any other tree of value or\r\nlongevity. Two 6-year-old trees of the eastern black walnut grown in the\r\nWiliamette Valley of Western Oregon, bore approximately a peck of nuts\r\napiece, in 1919, when they were photographed by the writer. In good soil\r\nand under favorable conditions of growth, it will be seen that the black\r\nwalnut is not always slow in developing but that it is sometimes a rapid\r\ngrower.\r\n\r\nThree varieties of black walnut are now available from the nurserymen.\r\nThey are the Thomas from Pennsylvania, the Ohio from some 20 miles south\r\nof Toledo, and the Stabler from Howard County, Maryland 15 or 20 miles\r\noutside the District of Columbia. All are prolific, precocious and of\r\nsuperior cracking quality. The Thomas was discovered and first\r\npropagated some 30 years ago. The young grafted trees show a tendency to\r\nbegin bearing in the nursery rows.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, the black walnut is regarded as being of greater\r\npromise for planting in the northern states than is any other species\r\neither native or introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JAPANESE WALNUT\r\n\r\nTo a considerable extent this species has been confused with the Persian\r\nwalnut, although the two are quite unlike. This is a dwarfish species\r\nwith dull green rough leaflets often as many as 15 or 17 per leaf, which\r\noften bears nuts in clusters of a dozen or more. While green the outer\r\nhulls of the nuts are rough, and somewhat sticky.\r\n\r\nThe Persian walnut is a standard-sized upright growing tree with bright\r\ngreen leaflets, usually 5 to 7 per leaf, and smooth, round nut hulls\r\nwhich split open and shed the nuts automatically.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese walnuts hybridize freely with other species of walnuts and\r\nproduce nuts of all types; not infrequently crosses of this kind\r\nresemble butternuts so closely as to be practically indistinguishable\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nTrue Japanese walnuts have a range in form of two distinct types. The\r\nbetter known is of guinea egg shape; the other, often known as the\r\nheartnut, is of distinct heart shape. Neither is large; the former is of\r\nabout the size of a guinea egg or smaller; the latter is still smaller.\r\nBoth are like the black walnut in being encased in a rough outer husk,\r\nwhich upon maturing shrivels and adheres to the surface of the nut. The\r\nshells are thinner than are those of the black walnut, but thicker than\r\nare those of the Persian walnut. When well matured, the shell of the\r\nheartnut tends to open slightly at the apex, after which it can be\r\nreadily split in half with a knife blade. The flavor of the kernel is\r\nmuch like that of the American butternut.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese walnut is ordinarily hardy wherever the black succeeds. It\r\nis by no means uncommon in Michigan where it is especially appropriate\r\nfor family planting. For the present, seedling trees will have to be\r\nrelied upon almost wholly, as very few varieties have been propagated.\r\nSo far as the writer is informed, the only named variety available from\r\na northern nursery is the Lancaster introduced by J. F. Jones, a\r\nnurseryman at Lancaster, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSIAN WALNUT\r\n\r\nPerhaps no species of nut tree has attracted as great attention in\r\nMichigan as has the Persian walnut. Under some conditions it does well\r\nfor a time in the eastern or northeastern states, but on the whole its\r\nperformance is distinctly erratic. Commercially speaking, it is of\r\nimportance in this country only on the Pacific coast. Trees on the\r\ncampus at Michigan Agricultural College and at many private places in\r\nthe central part of the state, have come to little. Usually they grow\r\nwell in summer only to freeze back nearly as much in winter. In Saranac\r\nCounty, eastern Michigan, close to Lake Huron there are a few young\r\norchards that are in good condition, but a half mile back from the lake\r\nthe results are discouraging. The same is true next to Lake Michigan\r\nfrom Grand Rapids south to the Indiana line.\r\n\r\nThe only recommendations that can be made relative to planting the\r\nPersian walnut in Michigan are, that it be planted very cautiously in\r\nany part of the state and except under very favored circumstances it be\r\nnot at all in the middle of the state.\r\n\r\nDo not undertake to grow the trees by planting the nuts or by buying\r\nseedlings. The most desirable trees are those of hardy varieties, budded\r\non the black walnut as a stock a foot or more above ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FILBERT\r\n\r\nThe filbert has been one of our tantalizing species of nut trees. In\r\nEngland, trees grow to ages of from one to two hundred years, bearing\r\nprofusely meanwhile. There, for many years, they are grown under apple\r\ntrees with currants below them. In Germany, we are told that\r\nstrawberries are grown below the currants and gooseberries. We are\r\nwaiting for the Yankee who will be first to grow peanuts or potatoes\r\nbelow strawberries. In the eastern part of this country, plants of the\r\nEuropean kinds are disappointing in two ways. First, they are uncertain\r\nas to their ability to bear; and second, they are highly susceptible to\r\na fungus disease found everywhere that the native hazels abound. The\r\nnative species is quite able to resist this disease, but the\r\nintroductions ordinarily succumb to it quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific Northwest, where by many filbert culture is believed\r\ndestined to become a successful and paying industry within the next few\r\nyears, not infrequently some varieties begin to blossom as early as in\r\nDecember. The blooming is largely responsible for the failure of eastern\r\ntrees to set and mature crops of nuts.\r\n\r\nSeveral nurserymen are now endeavoring to find varieties of commercial\r\nvalue in the eastern part of the country. Apparently they are meeting\r\nwith some success as far as their work has gone. Many of the varieties\r\nthey are testing are proving inferior, but a few have borne good nuts in\r\ngratifying quantity for several years. During the past winter, a good\r\nmany froze severely, although they are commonly hardy under severe\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nWherever they are planted, they should have fertile soil, from 20 to 25\r\nfeet of space each way and should be trained to tree form. After 10\r\nyears or so, they should be headed back severely, unless regular pruning\r\nhas been practiced in the meantime. Filberts fruit only on new wood.\r\n\r\nTo those who have read this article to this point, it is now apparent\r\nthat the nut industry of Michigan lies almost wholly in the future. The\r\nnative varieties form an excellent ground work for that future, but to\r\nproperly take advantage of that base, it will be necessary for\r\npractically every nut lover in the state to lend a helping hand. The\r\nfirst great movement necessary is to examine the nuts in the fall as\r\nripen in order to find the best of the walnuts, hickories, native\r\nhazels, beeches and introduced chestnuts, walnuts and filberts. In this\r\neveryone can help. Whoever finds a tree of any kind bearing superior\r\nnuts will render a great service by sending specimens, together with his\r\nor her address and that of the owner of the tree to the Federal\r\nDepartment of Agriculture at Washington, D. C., or to Willard G. Bixby,\r\nTreasurer of the Association, Baldwin, Nassau County, N. Y. Be sure to\r\ncarefully note the exact tree, from which the nuts were obtained and if\r\nspecimens are sent from more than one tree, they should be kept separate\r\nand each carefully labeled. Such nuts will be examined and if found to\r\nbe the equal or superior to the varieties already being grown, they will\r\nbe named and arrangements made for this propagation and test.\r\n\r\nNo prizes are given by the Government but good nuts sent the Government\r\nwill be eligible to entry in the contest of the Northern Nut Growers'\r\nAssociation. If enough specimens are sent the Department, some will be\r\nforwarded to the Treasurer of that Association who has charge of awards.\r\n\r\nAccording to very recent reports, the outlook for a nut crop during the\r\ncoming year was never better. This should, therefore, be an excellent\r\nyear for finding the trees bearing the best nuts.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I believe Mr. Reed expects to give an\r\nadditional talk tonight with lantern slides.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: There will be an informal talk, a question box\r\nthis evening for the benefit of any interested in the general discussion\r\nof nut culture in the United States. I notice the guests of the\r\ninstitution are deeply interested in nut growing in their particular\r\nstates; so the arrangement for this evening is to give those persons an\r\nopportunity to come out and ask questions.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: While Mr. Reed is on that subject, I would like to\r\nask if there is a chestnut as large as the Boone or other chestnuts\r\ngrown by Mr. Riehl of as good flavor as the American Sweet chestnut. A\r\ngood many people are asking me from time to time what the merit is in\r\nthose large chestnuts. Invariably they have found that the quality is\r\nnot as good as in the American sweet chestnut. I have been assured and\r\nMr. Reed says that the kernel of these is very good. I wonder if there,\r\nare some of them better than others--of the very large chestnuts.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: There is a difference. The Boone that Mr.\r\nOlcott refers to is a cross between the American species and the\r\nJapanese. The Japanese has not a good flavor; it is considerably below\r\nthat of the American; but the Boone is quite good; but there are some of\r\nMr. Riehl's chestnuts that are better. Mr. Riehl's are believed to be\r\nthe pure American sweet chestnuts and some of them are very good,\r\nperhaps not quite as sweet as our American sweet, but they are\r\nexceedingly satisfactory and very popular in the Chicago markets where\r\nMr. Riehl's chestnuts are going.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: This fall I received a chestnut which I am satisfied\r\nwas Japanese, which is very large, and seemingly about as sweet as the\r\nAmerican. I did not have the American there to test it by, but it was\r\nvery interesting to me, and I am planning to get scions in the spring to\r\nfollow it up further. It was seemingly a Japanese chestnut, and pretty\r\nnearly as large as the Boone.\r\n\r\nMR. J. F. JONES: I might say that so far as I have tested them,\r\nsome of the Japanese are quite sweet, but the meat is generally tough,\r\nnot brittle and sweet like the American.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I believe Mr. Linton is with us, and we shall\r\nbe glad to hear from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT TREES FOR HIGHWAYS AND PUBLIC PLACES\r\n\r\nWILLIAM S. LINTON, SAGINAW, MICHIGAN\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a number of years it has been a source of gratification and pleasure\r\nto me to be identified with the membership of the Northern Nut Growers'\r\nAssociation. True, \"a long distance membership only,\" but nevertheless a\r\nconnection that all must admit has borne fruit, or nuts, as you may\r\nprefer to state it.\r\n\r\nTo this association and its official journal must be given full credit\r\nfor the pioneer work in a great and good movement that will sweep, not\r\nonly over the United States, but over every clime and county in the\r\nworld's Western hemisphere as well. Your seed sown in the peninsular\r\nstate of Michigan, was the first to sprout in a substantial way in so\r\nfar as public planting of nut trees by a sovereign state is concerned,\r\nand it was our good fortune to have as staunch supporters for the plan\r\nsuch able and persistent workers as my good friend, Senator Harvey A.\r\nPenney of Saginaw, Professor A. K. Chittenden of the Michigan\r\nAgricultural College, and last, but not least, Honorable Frank F.\r\nRogers, Michigan's excellent State Highway Commissioner. Upon the latter\r\nwill largely devolve the duty of carrying out the law's provisions, as\r\nprovided in Senator Penney's bill passed at the last session of the\r\nLegislature, and that it will be well and practically done, goes without\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nAnd now to my theme, \"Should the Country Roadsides be Planted and Why.\"\r\nThe present high cost of living, and in fact the cost of living at any\r\ntime is a fruitful and serious problem. Our vast natural resources\r\nduring the century gone, of forests, of game, and of grazing lands, have\r\nalmost to the point of extinction been rapidly passing away, and it\r\nbehooves us, who have profited thereby and now owe a duty to our race to\r\nartificially provide wherever and whenever we can for the future of\r\nhumankind. In what better way can this be done than in utilizing the\r\nimmense acreage of America's vast system of highways, (now absolutely\r\nwasted except for the sole purpose of travel), to reproduce the very\r\nfinest of our country's magnificent trees, to again afford beauty,\r\ngrateful shade, valuable timber and the choicest of food in great\r\nabundance for the generations to come.\r\n\r\nWere this not a convention devoted to the advancement of nut growing\r\nalone, I would be glad to extol also for road planting fruit trees of\r\nevery kind of adequate size and character, and free or nearly so, from\r\nthe ravages of disease or insect pest, would be glad to praise the\r\nstately, hard maple, with its clear, sweet sap, producing the syrup and\r\nsugar that are the delight of childhood and age, and would be glad to\r\nrecommend the useful basswood with its valuable lumber and its fragrant\r\nyellow flowers, producing that nectar from which our most delicious\r\nhoney is made, and would be glad to recommend for our highways, certain\r\nother majestic trees needed by man and beautiful in the landscape.\r\n\r\nBut the object of this association and convention is a specialized one,\r\nas undoubtedly it should be, owing to the important field it covers, and\r\ntherefore the nut trees and it alone for planting on highways and in\r\npublic places should be the subject of this paper.\r\n\r\nIf we were to confine ourselves to one native variety or species for our\r\nNorthern territory, the great majority of people would unhesitatingly\r\nsay, let it be the Black Walnut (_Juglans nigra_). Attaining as it does\r\na height of 100 feet and more, and a trunk of four feet and over in\r\ndiameter, with a symmetrical top of splendid foliage, bearing the\r\nrichest of nuts and its timber the most valuable in the country, with a\r\nnatural range extending from Michigan to Mississippi and from Delaware\r\nto the Dakotas, it should be universally planted throughout the United\r\nStates along thousands of miles of our great trunk line roads.\r\n\r\nIts nearest American relative, the butternut (_Juglans cinerea_)\r\npreferring lower lands along river bottoms, attaining an average height\r\nof 60 feet with a trunk of 3 feet, its wood suitable for cabinet work,\r\nits bark with medicinal properties, and its nuts of splendid flavor,\r\nshould be planted where soil conditions call for it.\r\n\r\nFor their rich, delicious nuts, alone, saying nothing about their clean,\r\nhandsome foliage, their rough, strong wood--the best of any grown for\r\nmany purposes--the hickories, among which are the Shagbark (_Carya\r\novata_) and the big shellbark (_Carya laciniosa_), should be planted in\r\nmany places. They both frequently attain 100 feet in height with\r\nstraight sturdy trunks averaging from three to four feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe other nut trees suitable for roadside planting, are not specially\r\nattractive to mankind for their fruits, as heretofore used or utilized,\r\nbut may eventually become so under modern methods of cooking or proper\r\ntreatment. In their raw state, however, all are edible and also\r\npalatable to most people, but their chief food value today, is to\r\nprovide rich provender to domestic animals and birds, or the desirable\r\nwild life of the woodlands, all of which devour them eagerly, adding\r\nquickly to their weight and greatly to their quality and flavor of their\r\nflesh. I refer to the three magnificent oaks producing sweet acorns,\r\nviz., the White Oak (_Quercus albaq_), the Bur Oak (_Quercus\r\nmacrocarpa_) and the Swamp White Oak (_Quercus plantanoides_). They are\r\nall emblematic of great strength and grandeur, reaching the majestic\r\nheight of 100 feet, with trunks four or five feet in diameter; the leaf\r\ncoloring at times is indescribably beautiful and the timber owing to its\r\ngreat solidity and strength is of the utmost value.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the American beech, with a three or four foot trunk\r\nand almost 100 feet in height, distinct and beautiful, will demand the\r\nattention of those who plant our highways. Its nuts, feasted upon by\r\nmany forest denizens, may be classed with the sweet acorns heretofore\r\nreferred to, but the tree has a grace and charm all its own and it\r\nthrives from the warm waters of the Gulf to the icy shores of Lake\r\nSuperior.\r\n\r\nAt this time we cannot recommend what has been a noble, almost\r\nfascinating tree, 100 feet its usual height and sometimes spreading 100\r\nfeet almost in extent, with a trunk that in some cases reached a\r\ndiameter of 10 feet, with clusters of golden catkins fragrant in\r\nmidsummer, resulting in great quantities of delicious nuts in autumn.\r\nSuch was the chestnut, _Castanea dentata_, of the past, the fate of\r\nwhich, and almost extinction, has been a tragedy in the ranks of our\r\nnative trees that has brought bitter regrets to all lovers of this\r\npartician of the forest. Good news comes from the far East, however, to\r\nthe effect that some specimens of this famous tree have escaped or\r\nproven immune to the blight, and if the latter, it means the saving of\r\nthe species and its replanting in soil and territory where it may thrive\r\nas of yore.\r\n\r\nHaving now enumerated the varieties of trees that should be selected in\r\nthe main for the planting of highways and in public places, the question\r\nnow arises as to the best method of carrying on the work in a practical\r\nway throughout the country.\r\n\r\nIndividuals or small communities certainly can not be depended upon to\r\ndo it, as the result would be of a patchwork character that would not be\r\npleasing to the eye or beneficial in its results.\r\n\r\nOnly federal, state and municipal governments can take charge of this\r\ngreat work and carry it forward to completion.\r\n\r\nThe State of Michigan, now as you know, by legal enactment, causes state\r\nauthorities to plant the trunk line, highways, the county to plant the\r\nroads of the county systems, and the cities and villages and townships\r\nthose minor roads that are within their borders.\r\n\r\nIn case of individual effort, where an owner of land plants\r\nfood-producing trees along the highways in front of his property, he is\r\nreimbursed by stated amounts covering each tree so planted, the returns\r\ncoming to him by a reduction in the amount of his own taxation.\r\n\r\nThis so-called Michigan plan carried on throughout the entire country,\r\nwould call for a supply of trees of the character named far beyond the\r\nability of the commercial growers to supply, and in my opinion can be\r\nworked out only by seed or seedlings of the various varieties. And why\r\nnot? The cost would be much less than of any other method, and only a\r\nfew years would pass before substantial returns would commence to come.\r\nIt has been stated and it is true, that the seeds of the trees named do\r\nnot always produce superior nuts, but in a great majority only those of\r\na common or inferior kind. However, choice specimens will appear also,\r\nand from these of the better class grafting may be done to enrich all.\r\n\r\nThen again, it is a question as to whether the important tap roots of\r\nthe important nut species should be disturbed or destroyed in\r\ntransplanting. It would seem to be the proper plan, therefore, in order\r\nto avoid too great an expense, that the nuts or seed should be used in a\r\ngreat majority of highway planting, the trees to remain where first\r\nplaced on approved roadside lines, and the proper distance apart.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that too great a time would elapse between the planting\r\nof the seed and the maturity of the tree, but as time goes nowadays, it\r\nwould not be an unreasonable period, and there are those within the\r\nsound of my voice now, who will witness in their maturity the\r\nmagnificent trees producing their valuable products and adding to the\r\nbeauty of the landscape and to the welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\nThis Association has been the pioneer in this great movement, and it\r\nwill be the credit to those connected therewith in the generations to\r\ncome, in that they have all contributed in a very marked degree to the\r\neverlasting benefit of mankind.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Is there any discussion?\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: I believe Senator Penney is to discuss a topic\r\nvery closely affiliated with this one and perhaps it would be well to\r\ndefer the discussion until we hear his address.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: We will be glad to have Senator Penney present\r\nhis paper next, then. It is along the same lines--legislation in regard\r\nto tree planting.\r\n\r\nSENATOR PENNEY: When my friend, Mr. Linton, started off to\r\ndiscuss his paper, he said he was a long distance member, and you can\r\nsee the effect in the fruits he has borne or the nuts he has borne. Ever\r\nsince I was taken sick up north, he has been trying to tell me I was a\r\nnut. I was taken sick up there in the deer hunting camp, and my friend,\r\nMr. Linton, assisted in getting me out and rushing me to the nearest\r\nhospital, and it happened to be an insane asylum in northern Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION REGARDING THE PLANTING OF NUT AND OTHER FOOD PRODUCING TREES\r\n\r\nSENATOR HARVEY A. PENNEY, SAGINAW, MICHIGAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to express my hearty appreciation to your Association for the\r\ndistinct honor of being invited to address your meeting upon the subject\r\nof \"Legislation Regarding the Planting of Nut and Other Food Trees.\" I\r\nbelieve that my invitation came as a result of having been responsible\r\nfor introducing a tree-planting bill in the Senate of the 1919 session\r\nof the Michigan State Legislature, and later in securing its passage.\r\n\r\nThis bill purported \"to regulate the planting of ornamental,\r\nnut-bearing and other food-producing trees along the highways of the\r\nState of Michigan, or in public places, and for the maintenance,\r\nprotection and care of such trees, and to provide a penalty for injury\r\nthereof, or for stealing the products thereof.\"\r\n\r\nFor several sessions of the Michigan Legislature prior to 1919, bills\r\nhad been introduced intending to accomplish this result, but each time\r\nheretofore they have regularly failed to pass. This fate included one\r\nintroduced by the writer during the session of 1917. I am now fully\r\nconvinced that none of these bills, although a step in the right\r\ndirection, seemed to provide the proper working machinery or necessary\r\nfeatures to put them into practical operation, and hence did not appeal\r\nto the legislative committees, nor to the members of the several\r\nlegislatures.\r\n\r\nDuring the regular session of 1919, with the valuable assistance of Hon.\r\nW. S. Linton of Saginaw, a new bill was prepared providing an entirely\r\nnew method of supplying and planting such trees, and for putting such a\r\nlaw into effective operation under the jurisdiction of the state. It was\r\nmade to work in harmony with the rights of the property owner adjoining\r\nthe highway, and with the duties of those state officials whose\r\ndepartments were perfectly adapted and equipped for putting the law into\r\nactive operation.\r\n\r\nI am going to attach an enrolled copy of the tree planting bill at the\r\nend of this paper, so that it may be made a part of the permanent\r\nrecords of the Association. It will therefore be unnecessary to give a\r\ndetailed account of all the provisions contained therein.\r\n\r\nI will, however, mention a few of the principal points so that you may\r\nunderstand its purpose. It provides that the Public Domain Commission\r\nwhich has charge of the state forest reserve lands and parks, together\r\nwith the Michigan Agricultural College, are given authority to grow and\r\nacquire suitable seeds, scions or trees for planting under the\r\nprovisions of this act. A department of the Agricultural College\r\ndetermines the kind of trees which are adapted or suitable for planting\r\nin different soils or places. In order to insure a uniform system of\r\nplanting, this duty is left to the State Highway Commission and the\r\nState Board of Agriculture, acting jointly. The trees belong to the\r\nstate, but the nuts or other products belong to the owner of the land\r\nadjoining the highway. A penalty is imposed if these trees are defaced\r\nwith advertisements or signs, and neither can they be cut down or\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nBut just as you find legislatures differing in their opinions upon\r\npublic matters, so you must expect them to differ more or less upon the\r\nfeasibility of most any bill that is presented for their consideration.\r\nAll kinds of arguments are made for and against any bill. I remember\r\nthat one Senator in the committee thought that trees planted along the\r\nhighways bearing nuts or fruit would constantly be subject to a lot of\r\ntampering and molestation by the traveling public. But another Senator\r\ncame back with a reply that seemed to be very convincing, when he stated\r\nthat he had a fine row of cherry trees growing along the front of his\r\nfarm, and had never experienced any trouble of that kind from such a\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nI have always felt that if the merits of a good bill were properly\r\nexplained to a legislature committee, there will be no hesitancy in\r\nhaving it favorably reported out and finally passed. I believe the\r\nlegislature of 1919 took this view of the tree planting bill introduced\r\nby myself, as it was passed by both the Senate and the House, and later\r\nreceived the signature of Governor Sleeper, thus making it an\r\nestablished law of Michigan.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to mention the fact that after this bill had been\r\npassed by the legislature and still needed the signature of the Governor\r\nto make it a law, a number of Michigan's representative and influential\r\ncitizens wrote to Governor Sleeper, urging him to affix his signature\r\nthereto. Among those was Dr. J. H. Kellogg of Battle Creek, who has more\r\nthan a nation-wide reputation in his profession and is at present a\r\nstrong factor in the success of this association.\r\n\r\nThis law is intended not only to ornament the public highways of\r\nMichigan, but also to furnish nut bearing and other food-producing trees\r\nthat should assist materially in the problems incident to the high cost\r\nof living. It would seem that such a law should be duplicated in every\r\nstate where practicable, and also be promoted by the National Government\r\nupon National Highways.\r\n\r\nThe people of Michigan recently voted to amend the State Constitution so\r\nas to permit the issuance of $50,000,000.00 worth of bonds for the\r\nimprovement of public highways. By the time that this large sum has been\r\napportioned over a period of say ten years, and the road moneys\r\nfurnished and expended during this time, as federal aid by the federal\r\ngovernment, local counties and townships are added thereto, it has been\r\nestimated that the vast sum of nearly $200,000,000.00 will have been\r\nused solely for the improvement of our state highways.\r\n\r\nWith a wonderful highway system thus established, beautifully adorned by\r\nthe state with nut-bearing and other trees, the roads of Michigan should\r\nbecome a great attraction in which our citizens would not only have a\r\njust pride, but serve as a model of excellence for the whole nation to\r\nimitate.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator\r\nwhat danger there is likely to be in the protection of these trees when\r\nthey are once planted. Is the tree going to have right of way, or is the\r\ntelephone company going to have right of way in cutting out the top; or\r\nis a new bred consciousness going to have authority. If it is possible\r\nthat the trees will be destroyed as many have been, perhaps the\r\nlegislation may be changed in some way. Suppose we want to give them\r\ngood care, what are we going to do?\r\n\r\nSENATOR PENNEY: The law has a section in it providing for\r\ndefacing and damaging the trees or cutting them down. I have a copy of\r\nthe bill there. As my throat is in bad shape perhaps it might be well to\r\nhave the secretary read the bill. It is not very long.\r\n\r\nMR. LINTON: In this connection I would also ask for the reading\r\nof the bill by the secretary. This is a bill that may be copied by other\r\nstates throughout the Union, and if there is any criticism that is just,\r\nin reason, for changing any of the features in the bill, they should be\r\ndecided upon at this meeting or by a committee. Because a uniform bill\r\nthroughout the country is really something desirable, I think, in\r\nconnection with this legislation. And I would add further: Michigan does\r\nnot have an entire monopoly of Highway legislation at the present time,\r\nbut is in a prominent position in connection therewith. The chairman of\r\nthe committee on post offices and post roads of the United States Senate\r\nis Senator Townsend, of this State. It is his bill that will cause the\r\nnational highways to be constructed from ocean to ocean. Senator\r\nTownsend is one of our best beloved citizens; his heart is in this work;\r\nand I am sure from what I know of him (and he is a close friend of mine)\r\nthat he will enter heartily into the spirit of embodying in national\r\nlegislation something of the character that we have in state legislation\r\nin Michigan so that it may apply to the whole country as well. And for\r\nthat reason I would like to have the bill read. It is a short one, and\r\nany additions or any amendments thereto I know will be gladly received\r\nby Senator Penny or myself.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: Mr. President, I think that is one of the most\r\nimportant subjects that can come before this Association; not only\r\nthat, but the interest of every member should be enlisted particularly\r\nin this subject. The possibilities of the extension of that work are\r\nalmost unlimited and directly in line with the objects of this\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I am just wondering whether we would have time\r\nto have it read now, or postpone it to a little later. Dr. Kellogg is\r\nwith us now.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: This bill is very short. (Read bill.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Senate Bill No. 59           Introduced by Senator Penney\r\n  (File No. 150)\r\n\r\n  STATE OF MICHIGAN\r\n  50th Legislature\r\n  Regular Session of 1919\r\n  SENATE ENROLLED ACT NO. 18\r\n\r\n     An act to regulate the planting of ornamental, nut bearing or other\r\n     food producing trees along the highways of the State of Michigan,\r\n     or in public places, and for the maintenance, protection and care\r\n     of such trees and to provide a penalty for injury thereof, or for\r\n     stealing the products thereof.\r\n\r\n     The People of the State of Michigan enact\r\n\r\n     Section 1. The State Highway Commissioner and the State Board of\r\n     Agriculture, acting jointly hereunder, shall have authority and it\r\n     shall be their duty to select and plant by seed, scions or\r\n     otherwise, ornamental, nut bearing, or other food producing trees,\r\n     (to be supplied by the Public Domain Commission, or the Michigan\r\n     Agricultural College, as may be recommended or approved by the\r\n     Division of Agriculture of said college,) suitable for shade trees,\r\n     along the State trunk line highways and all other highways of the\r\n     State of Michigan, upon which State reward has been paid or earned:\r\n\r\n     Provided, that in no case shall such trees be planted except by and\r\n     with the consent of the owner of the property adjoining such\r\n     highway. The State Highway Commissioner shall establish rules and\r\n     regulations for uniform planting or proper placing of all trees\r\n     under the provisions of this act, and all such trees shall belong\r\n     to the State, but the products thereof shall belong to the owners\r\n     of the adjacent land. Nothing herein contained shall authorize the\r\n     State Highway Commissioner, or the State Board of Agriculture to\r\n     cut down or interfere with shade trees now growing along any such\r\n     highway, without permission in writing from the owner of the\r\n     adjoining property.

The expenditure of any such fund\r\n     shall be vested in the highway commissioner in the case of county\r\n     roads, and in the proper highway authorities of the city or village\r\n     as the case may be.\r\n\r\n     Section 3. The owner of any real estate in the State of Michigan\r\n     that borders upon a legal highway upon which State reward has not\r\n     been paid, shall have the right to plant said approved ornamental,\r\n     nut bearing, or other food producing trees along the line of said\r\n     highway adjoining said land, and shall receive annually a credit of\r\n     five cents upon his highway repair tax for each tree so planted by\r\n     him and growing in good order, not less than six feet in height\r\n     when planted and not less than twenty and not more than forty feet\r\n     apart. All of said trees and their products shall belong to the\r\n     owner of said land: Provided, that no bounty shall be paid or\r\n     deduction allowed under the provision of this section upon any one\r\n     tree or row of trees for a longer period than five years. The owner\r\n     of such trees shall have the care thereof and shall have the duty\r\n     and responsibility for the trimming, spraying and cultivation\r\n     thereof.\r\n\r\n     Section 4. The Michigan Agricultural College and Public Domain\r\n     Commission are hereby authorized to grow and acquire suitable\r\n     seeds, scions or trees for planting under the provisions of this\r\n     act, and to establish proper rules and regulations for distributing\r\n     the same at nominal cost, or otherwise, to counties, townships,\r\n     cities, villages, and citizens of the State for the aforesaid\r\n     purpose, and also for State parks or other public places.\r\n\r\n     Section 5. It shall be unlawful to cut, destroy, injure, deface or\r\n     break any ornamental, nut bearing, food producing or shade tree\r\n     upon any public highway or place, except where such trees shall\r\n     interfere with the proper construction or maintenance of such\r\n     highways. It shall be unlawful to affix to any such tree any\r\n     picture, announcement, play-bill, notice or advertisement, or to\r\n     paint or mark such tree, except for the purpose of protecting it,\r\n     or to negligently permit any animal to break down, injure or\r\n     destroy any such tree within the limits of any public highway. Any\r\n     person violating any of the provisions of this act shall be guilty\r\n     of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a\r\n     fine of not less than one dollar or more than twenty-five dollars,\r\n     and in default of payment of any such fine may be imprisoned in the\r\n     county jail for a period not exceeding thirty days.

SLEEPER,\r\n  Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: Mr. Chairman, I _move_ that before adjournment\r\nthe chairman appoint a committee of three members of this association to\r\ncarefully review this bill and either report in favor of any suggestions\r\nthat they may wish to make in regard to its amendment or give approval\r\nof the bill as it stands.\r\n\r\nMR. LINTON: I support the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: It is moved and seconded that the chairman\r\nappoint a committee of three to carry out the recommendations. All in\r\nfavor say Aye; contrary, No. It is CARRIED.\r\n\r\nSENATOR PENNEY: That law is adjusted to the laws of Michigan\r\nand any other state proposed would have to adjust it to fit their laws.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I would like to have Mr. C. A. Reed on that\r\ncommittee, Mr. Olcott and Dr. Morris.\r\n\r\nC. A. REED: Then, Mr. President, in addition to that we are\r\ngoing to take the liberty of adding an _ex officio_ member, Mr.\r\nLittlepage, an ex-president and also a good thoroughgoing nut.\r\n\r\nMR. JONES: My understanding is the provision for six-ft. trees.\r\nSix foot nut trees unless they have been transplanted several times will\r\nhardly succeed. I would say use small trees along the highway.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I think that would need to be worked out. I\r\nthink a six foot tree is a little dangerous in some varieties. The\r\ncommittee might find it wise to offer some suggestions in that line.\r\n\r\nVOICE: If you plant a tree six feet high, you are sure of\r\nhaving a tree there.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I believe Dr. Kellogg is about ready now, and\r\nwe will hear from Dr. Kellogg whom you are all acquainted with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOY BEAN\r\n\r\nDR. J. H. KELLOGG, BATTLE CREEK, MICHIGAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the live stock industry is shriveling up. The\r\nlivestock inhabitants of the country--the pigs, sheep and cattle--are\r\nmuch smaller in population at the present time than they were\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years ago, and are getting smaller all the time.\r\nThe price of meat is high and is going to continue to climb. It is away\r\nout of reach of the average laboring man even at the present time. I\r\nheard Dr. Charley Mayo say at a clinic not long ago that meat is so high\r\nhe could not afford to eat it and he didn't see how anybody could; and\r\nas a matter of fact, he didn't need it anyhow, and so we could easily\r\nget along without it. As a matter of fact, as Mr. Bill said some years\r\nago it is not really so much the high cost of living as it is the cost\r\nof high living; and the use of meat is such an extravagant and expensive\r\nthing it is very important that people should know how to get along\r\nwithout meat.\r\n\r\nThe experimenters of the agricultural experiment stations have shown us\r\nthat it takes thirty-three pounds of dry digestible food substance to\r\nmake one pound of beef--31 or 32 pounds to make a pound of beef, and 33\r\nor 34 pounds to make a pound of mutton. Seven pounds of digestible food\r\nsubstance will make a pound of dry milk. So we can readily see that\r\nthere is an enormous waste of foodstuff. Only about ten per cent of the\r\ncorn raised is used for feeding human beings. The rest is fed to animals\r\nand a large part of it is wasted.\r\n\r\nSo it is exceedingly important, it seems to me, that this nut industry\r\nshould be encouraged in every way. A half million acres of nut trees\r\nwell advanced and producing would produce all of the fat and more\r\ndigestible fat, and all the protein and more digestible protein, than we\r\nare now using in the entire country. We are producing more than enough\r\nfood in corn and other foodstuffs to feed nearly three times our present\r\npopulation, and most of it is wasted in the energy which the hog, the\r\nsteer and other animals use up in running around and keeping warm. That\r\nis where the great loss comes. In nuts we have a choice foodstuff as\r\ndigestible as any other foodstuff, and Prof. Torrey and Prof. Mendel and\r\nothers who have recently made experiments have shown that the protein of\r\nthe nut and the protein of vegetables in general is not so putrescible\r\nas the protein of meats. There are good reasons for it. It does not\r\nundergo putrefaction so readily any way, and besides meat carries along\r\nwith it the bacteria which produce putrefaction.\r\n\r\nMeat is the filthiest thing that goes upon our tables. If the number of\r\nbacteria in milk was as great as the number of bacteria in meat, nobody\r\nwould think of eating it. If the bacteria in water were as numerous as\r\nin milk, no one would be willing to drink the water. It is a very\r\ncurious thing that we permit in milk and in meat a condition of things\r\nwe would not tolerate in air or water for a moment. Every morsel of meat\r\na person eats contains some billions of the bacteria of the very worst\r\nsort. Bacteria found in meat are those which produce colitis,\r\nappendicitis, abscesses of the teeth and diseased conditions of the\r\ntonsils. They predispose to a good many infectious diseases of the\r\nintestine, and no doubt predispose to cancer. It is pretty well\r\nestablished at the present time that cancer is a disease of meat eating\r\nmen and animals. About one cow in fifty has cancer, whereas every\r\nseventh dog taken to a hospital sick is found to have cancer. Dr. Mayo\r\nrecently gathered some statistics on this matter, and he told me and\r\nsome other doctors that dogs under eight years of age, every fourth one\r\nhas cancer; every third one of dogs ten years of age has cancer, and\r\nhalf of all the dogs over twelve years of age have cancer and would die\r\nof it if left to themselves. These statements were based on laboratory\r\nanimals that were killed when they were well and not sick, so the\r\nobservation ought to be fairly reliable.\r\n\r\nI was to say particularly a few words about the soy bean. I am not going\r\nto try to tell you very much about it, because I do not know very much\r\nabout it. If you want to learn all about it, you can easily do so by\r\nwriting to Mr. W. J. Morse, of the Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. Farmers' Bulletin 973, one\r\nof the very best on this subject, tells all about the culture of this\r\nexceedingly useful legume. The soy bean is really the beefsteak of China\r\nand Japan. In those oriental countries, soy beans have been used for\r\ncenturies. It is more nearly like a nut than a bean. Perhaps I better\r\nshow you the pictures first, and then have the curtains raised so we can\r\nget a better inspection of the beans.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the soy bean is very remarkably different from that\r\nof the ordinary bean. It contains forty per cent of fat, on the average\r\nand about forty per cent of protein--sometimes more than forty per cent.\r\nThe protein is sixty per cent more than in our best ordinary foods; and\r\nthe fat is five or six times as much as that found in the ordinary bean.\r\n\r\nA thousand different varieties of the soy bean have been gathered by the\r\nBureau of Plant Industry of the Department of Agriculture at Washington.\r\nFive hundred of these varieties have been tested, and thirty or forty of\r\nthem have been found to be adapted to this country, and very useful. You\r\ncan see in this picture the great mass of pods to be found growing on\r\nthe plant. This slide shows how unusually well they grow in the field.\r\nYou can see the pods scattered all through the plant. A large part of\r\nthe foliage is made up of pods. This is one of our own fields of the\r\nbeans that we raised this year. It is rather difficult to raise the bean\r\nin this latitude, because it requires a long time to mature. It requires\r\nabout 110 days for some varieties. We have, however, a variety we raised\r\nhere that we got from the agricultural department of Ontario. We found\r\nit matured very well indeed in 120 days. We planted the bean here the\r\nfirst week in May and harvested it the first week in September; so its\r\nseason was about 120 days. I found this particular bean was new to the\r\nagricultural department at Washington, and have sent them some of the\r\nseed, and I think they are going to make some trial of it.\r\n\r\nThis is a view of a field of the Hahto variety which is a particularly\r\nfine variety for use as a shelled bean. In China the soy bean is very\r\nlittle used as we use beans. They do not cook the bean and eat it as we\r\ndo; but instead they make it into a cheese which they call tofu, and\r\nthis cheese is made by soaking the beans, grinding them into a pulp,\r\nthen boiling for ten or fifteen minutes with about five volumes of\r\nwater; then the milky mass is precipitated with sulphate of magnesia or\r\ncitric acid, a very small amount because they use it as a curd. I have\r\nhere a sample of the curd which I will pass around in a moment for you\r\nto see. This picture shows this curd pressed in large cakes. The soy\r\nbean curd is stored on wooden trays in a dark room. It is also stored in\r\nlarge earthen jars. They cure it and make cheese out of it which very\r\nclosely resembles our American milk cheese. They also use the beans for\r\nsprouting.\r\n\r\nThe bean lacks only two things. It lacks lime and the fat-soluble\r\nvitamines. It contains a considerable amount of the fat-soluble\r\nvitamines. It is one of the very few seeds that is found to contain a\r\nsufficient amount of the fat-soluble vitamine to promote growth, so that\r\nanimals will grow and develop normally on the bean alone without any\r\nother sort of fat-soluble vitamine. If the bean is sprouted, a large\r\namount of this fat-soluble vitamine is produced by the plant itself.\r\nThis is also found to be a valuable means of preventing scurvy--by\r\nsprouting the beans in this way and using the sprouts as a salad. The\r\nsprouts are used as a green vegetable. It is an easy way of getting\r\ngreen vegetables at any season of the year. It takes the place of\r\nordinary greens.\r\n\r\nHere is a courtyard full of pots in which the fermented soy beans are\r\nplaced. This is a very interesting scheme they have for making a\r\nsubstitute for meat extract. By this means they prepare an extract which\r\nclosely resembles extract of beef. In fact, it is rather a finer\r\nflavored product than meat extracts. It is made by first cooking the\r\nbeans, spreading them out in the yard on trays and allowing a fungus to\r\ngrow, and after two or three weeks the whole mass is put into pots of\r\nbrine in the yard and allowed to remain there for a year or more, and at\r\nthe end of that time the brine has become soy sauce.\r\n\r\nThis shows a mass of soy roots. It has been suggested it might be very\r\nuseful to nut growers as a means of fertilizing the soil, a crop which\r\nwill fertilize the soil for the trees and at the same time give a\r\nvaluable return for the labor and expense. The little nodules on the\r\nroots are very numerous and show well here. They produce nitrogen,\r\nconcentrated nitrogen from the air as do the nodules on the roots of\r\nalfalfa. The _Scientific American_ recently stated that the soy bean is\r\none of the most promising of vegetables. It provides food for man and\r\nbeast. Given enough soy beans and granted the art of preparing them so\r\nthat they might be served as food having sufficient diversity and\r\npalatableness, neither meat nor fish nor fat would be needed. In this\r\nrespect the Germans did not prepare for war. If they had had the soy\r\nbean industry well developed it might have helped them through, and the\r\nmap of the world might have been seriously changed from what it now is.\r\n\r\nI think one of the finest of the soy beans is the Hahto variety. They\r\ngrow one or two in a pod. I saw some of these beans in the market in\r\nJerusalem forty years ago. When about three quarters grown and used as\r\nshelled beans they are exceedingly palatable. If at the dinner table\r\ntoday you will call for a soy bean omelet, you will be quite surprised.\r\nDr. Morris tried it this morning and was kind enough to say it was the\r\nfinest he ever ate.\r\n\r\nThe soy bean is the best of a large part of the cookery of the orient.\r\nWe have been introducing it here the last few months, and it is very\r\npalatable, very digestible, and our patients like it very much. If you\r\nare interested in the soy bean, write, to W. J. Morse, or to the\r\nAgricultural Department, Bureau of Plant Industry, and they will give\r\nyou a lot of interesting information about it. In starting the planting\r\nof the bean, it is necessary to inoculate the soil as in the starting of\r\na planting of alfalfa.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Mr. Bixby has prepared a paper on \"Judging\r\nNuts\" which there is not now time for him to read. It will be inserted\r\nin the proceedings at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGING NUTS\r\n\r\nWILLARD G. BIXBY, BALDWIN, NASSAU CO., N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat there are differences in nuts is apparent to everybody. The\r\nselecting of the best nuts out of a lot of two or three usually presents\r\nno difficulty, and, when the number of nuts to be judged amounts to a\r\ndozen or so, it is generally possible to pick out the best, but, when\r\none has before him nuts from several hundred trees, the problem becomes\r\na very different one, and the person who tries to pick out the best from\r\nsuch a lot soon becomes aware of his own limitations. If, in addition,\r\nhe has sufficient respect for consistency to try to be so exact in his\r\njudgment as to be able to go over a large lot of nuts today, we will\r\nsay, and several months hence go over the same lot again and render the\r\nsame verdict on each one of them, he will doubtless give the matter up\r\nas an impossibility, and yet that is just what is wanted and expected of\r\nthose who judge the nuts which are sent in to the annual contests, which\r\ncontests have resulted in bringing to the attention of the nut growing\r\nworld the nuts of so many fine trees.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the last two or three years in being one of the judges\r\nwho passed on the nuts which were sent in to the contests convinced me,\r\nalmost at the start, of the desirability of getting methods where it\r\nwould be possible to go over a large lot of nuts now and several months\r\nhence, and render the same verdict on each one of them, but now how to\r\ndo it was not at first apparent, and the methods for doing it which will\r\nbe outlined are the results of much work, many attempts, and the\r\ndiscarding of many of the methods tried.\r\n\r\nConsidering the methods used in judging fruit, animals and fowl has\r\nhelped to some extent, but this assistance did not go far. The beginning\r\nof improved methods of judging any of the above, is the establishment of\r\na score card, as it is called, which is nothing more than an enumeration\r\nof the characteristics and a decision as to the relative value of each\r\none. Usually the values assigned to each characteristic are such that\r\nwhen added up the total will be 100 points. Score cards of this\r\ncharacter are in general use.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to make a score card for use in judging the nuts to\r\nwhich the Northern Nut Growers' Association gives its attention, so so\r\nfar as I am aware, was that of a committee of the Northern Nut Growers'\r\nAssociation, which reported at the Fifth Annual Meeting at Evansville,\r\nInd., 1914, and which report will be found on page 20 of the report of\r\nthat meeting. Prof. E. R. Lake was chairman of the committee. The score\r\ncard for butternuts, black walnuts and hickories which it recommended is\r\nnoted below:\r\n\r\n  General Values    Points\r\n    Size              10\r\n    Form               5\r\n    Color              5\r\n\r\n  Shell Values\r\n    Thinness          15\r\n    Cracking          20\r\n\r\n  Kernel Values\r\n    Color             10\r\n    Plumpness          5\r\n    Flavor            10\r\n    Quality           20\r\n                     ___\r\n\r\n      Total          100\r\n\r\nThis score card has served as a basis for all the work that has been\r\ndone in judging nuts since that work has largely fallen to me. It was\r\nearly found desirable, however, to change the score card in one or two\r\nrespects, and it has since been changed two or three times as the\r\nexperience gained in judging nuts saw it was desirable. The score card\r\nnow in use is noted below:\r\n\r\n  General Values\r\n    Weight               10\r\n    Form                  5\r\n    Color                 5\r\n\r\n  Shell Values\r\n    Husking Quality       5\r\n    Thinness             10\r\n    Cracking Quality     20\r\n\r\n  Kernel Values\r\n    Color                 5\r\n    Proportion of kernel 20\r\n    Quality and Flavor   20\r\n                        ___\r\n\r\n      Total             100\r\n\r\nThe first time one attempts to judge a large number of nuts whether with\r\nthe aid of such a score card as that proposed by Prof. Lake's Committee\r\nor without it, he gets into practical difficulties at once. These\r\ndifficulties are not with the score card but in its use. Take for\r\nexample the characteristic, size, the first one on Prof. Lake's score\r\ncard. How can a person tell from the nuts of a hundred hickory trees\r\nwhich is the largest and which is the smallest and which are\r\nintermediate; in short how can he arrange them in order of size, the\r\nlargest at one end of the line and the smallest at the other with a\r\nuniform graduation in between. Anyone who tries to do such a thing\r\nquickly finds that it is impossible to do this correctly if one has only\r\nhis eye to aid him in determining size. The inability to do so quickly\r\nbecomes apparent if a person tries to arrange such a lot of nuts in\r\norder of size at one time and then several days later tries to arrange\r\nthe same lot of nuts in order of size again. It is almost certain that\r\nthey will not get arranged the same both times. The differences between\r\nthe nuts are usually so minute, and, what is more important, the\r\ndifficulties of correctly estimating size by the eye alone are so great\r\nthat it is practically impossible to do it. An expert on this point can\r\ndo it of course much better than one who is not, but even the expert is\r\nonly too well aware of his limitations and of the impossibility of\r\nproperly doing the above. The same difficulty is apparent with every\r\ncharacteristic on the list and while judging by experts with the aid of\r\na score card, is, so far as I am aware, the method used in judging\r\nfruit, farm animals, poultry, etc., the crudeness of this method is only\r\ntoo evident to the experts themselves. Two or three years ago it seemed\r\nvery far inferior to what actually measuring these characteristics would\r\nbe, although such measurement at first seemed difficult, not to say\r\nalmost impossible. Much work has been done on this, and it is very\r\ngratifying to say that this measurement has been found possible to an\r\nextent that was not dreamed of before the work was started. Before\r\noutlining the methods worked out to do this a little discussion will be\r\ngiven on Prof. Lake's score card, the characteristics which it pointed\r\nout, and the reason shown for changing some of them.\r\n\r\nSize is a characteristic which is apparent to everyone, yet the actual\r\nmeasurement of size in the case of a large lot of nuts presents\r\ndifficulties which seem practically insurmountable. A serious attempt\r\nwas made to measure the length, breadth and height of the nuts examined\r\nand gauges were made which should do this exactly and quickly. These\r\nwere finely discarded and the characteristic \"weight\" adopted in place\r\nof size. This has to quite an extent replaced size in considering farm\r\nproducts. When we used to buy potatoes by the bushel we used to get a\r\nbushel basket full, now we get the legal weight of a bushel of potatoes\r\nand instances of this kind might be multiplied almost indefinitely.\r\nWhile weight and size are not exactly the same thing, yet they are so to\r\na large extent in the case of a given commodity, such as nuts of one\r\nspecies, and weight can be accurately and rapidly determined.\r\n\r\nPlumpness is another characteristic which we all understand as far as\r\nthe difference between a nut with a plump well filled kernel is\r\nconcerned, and one with a shriveled up kernel, but when it comes to\r\narranging the kernels of a lot of nuts in order of their plumpness, the\r\none who tries to do it becomes ready to give up before he really gets\r\nstarted. It was found that the ratio of the weight of kernel to the\r\nweight of the entire nut which is termed \"proportion of kernel\" was\r\nnever large in the case of a nut with shriveled kernel. It was small in\r\nthe case of a nut with a thick shell and a plump well filled kernel,\r\nbut, as stated above it was never large in the case of a nut with a\r\nshriveled kernel and a good deal of work on the subject convinced me\r\nthat the characteristic \"proportion of kernel\" could be very well\r\nsubstituted for plumpness.\r\n\r\nThere seemed at the present time little use for separating flavor and\r\nquality as there seemed to be some question as to what was intended by\r\nthe terms separately and so they were considered together. I would like\r\nto state here that little consideration has so far been given as to\r\nwhether the number of points awarded for each characteristic are such as\r\nto cause the nut that will ultimately be considered of most value\r\ncommercially to get the first prize or not. The score card of Prof.\r\nLake's seemed so good that it was thought far more important at present\r\nto develop methods of measuring these characteristics. A careful study\r\nof the nuts sent in to the contests, it was thought, would point out\r\nmost parts of the score card where improvement could be made, and this\r\nhas already proved to be so to a considerable extent. The methods of\r\nquantitatively measuring the different characteristics and determining\r\nthe number of points to be awarded for each will be outlined one at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWEIGHT: This is determined by an accurate scale, one weighing\r\nto 1/10 gram was used, and the same scale was used directly or\r\nindirectly for determining six out of the nine characteristics\r\nconsidered. In determining weight, five average nuts (as far as could be\r\ndetermined by appearance) were weighed and the average weight\r\ndetermined. Having at hand the weights of the largest and smallest nuts\r\nof the species under examination, the largest nut was awarded 10 points\r\nand the smallest 0 and the nuts of intermediate weight were awarded\r\nintermediate figures. The method of doing this will best be seen by\r\ntaking a specific instance e. g. the Lutz black walnut, the average\r\nweight of which is 26.4g. The Alley black walnut, the average weight of\r\nwhich is 10.0g is the smallest good black walnut which has come to our\r\nattention, while the Armknecht black walnut which weighs 28.9g is the\r\nlargest one of which we know. The Armknecht black walnut would be\r\nawarded 10 points for weight and the Alley 0 points and a table would be\r\nmade up for use in determining the number of points to be awarded for\r\nintermediate weights as noted below:\r\n\r\n\r\n  BLACK WALNUTS--WEIGHT\r\n\r\n  Heaviest Armknecht 28.9 grams; Lightest Alley 10.0 grams.\r\n\r\n  Weight of nut.                    Points.\r\n\r\n  28 grams and less than 30 grams    10\r\n  26   \"    \"    \"    \"  28   \"       9\r\n  24   \"    \"    \"    \"  26   \"       8\r\n  22   \"    \"    \"    \"  24   \"       6\r\n  20   \"    \"    \"    \"  22   \"       5\r\n  18   \"    \"    \"    \"  20   \"       4\r\n  16   \"    \"    \"    \"  18   \"       3\r\n  14   \"    \"    \"    \"  16   \"       2\r\n  12   \"    \"    \"    \"  14   \"       1\r\n  10   \"    \"    \"    \"  12   \"       0\r\n\r\nAfter the average weight of five nuts of a given variety has been\r\ndetermined, an inspection of the table shows at a glance the number of\r\npoints to be awarded for weight, which, in the case of the Lutz Black\r\nwalnut, is 9. In case a nut should be entered which was very much larger\r\nor smaller than provided for, the table can be extended for use\r\ntemporarily. The table, however, should be revised before being used the\r\nnext year. For example, had a nut come in weighing 30.5 grams this might\r\nhave been awarded 11 points, and had one weighing 8.5 grams come in this\r\nwould have been awarded-1 point in order to give each nut full credit,\r\nfor excellence in size or to penalize it for lack of it. It will be\r\nnoticed that by the method outlined the size of a nut is determined\r\nexactly and the same number of points for size (or weight) would be\r\nawarded today, next week, next month, or next year, barring of course\r\nreal changes, e. g. those caused by actual loss of moisture, etc.\r\n\r\nFORM: It was only recently that a method of measuring this\r\ncharacteristic has been suggested and this has been tried out only\r\nexperimentally. By form is meant attractive appearing shape which has\r\nbeen held to be absence of hollows, ridges, angles, etc. A round, smooth\r\nnut would be held to have perfect form in distinction from nuts that are\r\nrough and full of ridges or edges. The only method of measuring that\r\nhas been suggested and which it is believed will work out satisfactorily\r\nis to first select an average nut and weigh, then fill up the hollows in\r\nthe surface of the nut with wax just covering the ridges till the\r\nsurface is smooth, and weigh. This will give the weight of the nut plus\r\nthe weight of the wax needed to fill up the hollows on the surface. As\r\nthe specific gravity of the wax is 4/5 that of the nut the figure\r\nactually used is weight of nut plus 5/4 weight of the wax, which gives\r\nthe weight of a nut of the size of the sample with the hollows in the\r\nshell filled up or the weight of a nut of perfect form of the size of\r\nthe sample. The measurement of form is then the weight of the average\r\nnut divided by the weight of a nut of the same size of perfect shape,\r\nthat is without hollows or ridges.\r\n\r\nA measurement of form of a black walnut gave the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Weight of nut              22.5  grams\r\n  Weight of nut and wax      24.6    \"\r\n  Weight of wax               2.1    \"\r\n  Weight of 5-4 wax           2.6    \"\r\n  Weight of nut and 5-4 wax  25.1    \"\r\n  Form                22.5÷25.1=89.7%\r\n\r\nWhen a nut has perfect form there will be no hollows to fill and no wax\r\nwill be needed and the weight of nut and 5/4 of the wax will be the same\r\nas the weight of the nut and therefore its form figure will be 100%. The\r\nnumber of points to be awarded for any measurement of form would be\r\ndetermined by making up a table as was made up for awarding points for\r\nweight, but such a table cannot be made up till after an examination of\r\nform values for a large number of nuts. This will be done later.\r\n\r\nCOLOR: The color of shell was measured by making up samples of\r\nwater colors of all gradations of color between the lightest shell and\r\nthe darkest. From these, five were selected as showing in five steps the\r\ndifferences noted, the lightest being marked 5, the next 4 and so on\r\ndown to the darkest which was marked 0. With these color standards in\r\nfront of the one judging, it was only necessary to take the nut to be\r\njudged and lay it on the standards of color and the figure on the shade\r\nwhich the nut most nearly matched was the figure awarded for color.\r\n\r\nHUSKING QUALITY: This represents the ease with which the husk\r\ncan be removed. In view of the well known fact that husks of all nuts do\r\nnot come off with equal facility the need of such is apparent. Its\r\nmeasurement will be the proportion of husk removed by a standard husking\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nTHINNESS OF SHELL: This was measured by providing a means for\r\nbringing two metal surfaces together, keeping them always parallel. The\r\nnut to be cracked was placed between these surfaces and an arrangement\r\nof scale levers provided so that the pressure exerted on the nut could\r\nbe weighed. The surfaces were brought together till the nut was cracked\r\nand the pressure required was noted. This measures the thinness of the\r\nshell or more properly the strength of the shell, the weakest shell of\r\ncourse being the one that takes the least pressure to crack. This\r\npressure was measured in kilograms for by doing so it was possible to\r\nutilize some stock apparatus. After the pressure required to crack has\r\nbeen noted a reference to the table below will tell the number of points\r\nto be awarded. We will take for an example the the same nut as taken to\r\nillustrate weight e. g. the Lutz black walnut whose average cracking\r\npressure is 312kg and which therefore would be awarded 2 points for\r\nthinness of shell. In this connection it should be stated that this\r\ntable would seem not to be made out on the plan followed heretofore by\r\ntaking the thinnest shelled nut of which we know, the Alley, as the low\r\nlimit of the table. While the Alley black walnut takes the least\r\ncracking pressure of any we know which we can identify as from a\r\nparticular tree, one black walnut was cracked which I believe came from\r\nthe Ten Eyck tree which had a cracking pressure below 80kg and hence the\r\ntable was made of sufficient extent to include this. It is my intention\r\nto get additional Ten Eyck nuts this year and check the matter up.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BLACK WALNUTS--THINNESS OF SHELL\r\n\r\n  Weight required to crack: Thinnest, Alley 110kg; thickest, Triplett\r\n  348kg.\r\n\r\n  Weight in kg.

In cracking nuts a part of the\r\nkernel will usually drop right out, some times it is a large part,\r\noccasionally all, and sometimes it is but a small portion. A perfect\r\ncracker is one where the entire kernel drops out after cracking. This\r\nwould have 100% cracking quality. When 4/5 of the kernel drops out after\r\ncracking and the remaining 1/5 can be extracted only by recracking or\r\nby picking out, the nut is said to have 80% cracking quality. In other\r\nwords, the cracking quality is the ratio of the weight of the kernel\r\nwhich drops out after cracking to the entire kernel. The operations of\r\ndetermining cracking quality in practice are first, selecting five\r\naverage nuts; second, cracking them and weighing the part of the kernels\r\nwhich drop out after cracking; third, extracting the balance of the\r\nkernels and getting the weight of all the kernels; fourth, dividing the\r\nweight of the part of the kernels which drop out after cracking by the\r\ntotal weight of the kernels, and the result is the cracking quality.\r\nAfter an examination of the figures of a large number of nuts, the table\r\nbelow was made up from which the number of points to be awarded for any\r\ngiven cracking quality is readily obtained. Taking the Lutz black walnut\r\nas an example again we find that the weight of the kernels which dropped\r\nout after cracking was 24 grams while the total weight of kernels was\r\n32.5 grams which gives a cracking quality of 73.8% which would be\r\nawarded 13 points for cracking quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WALNUTS--CRACKING QUALITY\r\n\r\n  Percentage of kernel that drops out after cracking.\r\n  Highest, Alley[4], 100%; Lowest, Butler, 22.9%.\r\n\r\n  Cracking Quality.

If we take for example the Lutz black walnuts again we find\r\nthe weight of five average nuts 132.0 grams and the weight of the\r\nkernels of these nuts 32.5 grams which gives for the proportion of\r\nkernel 24.0% which would be awarded 8 points.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WALNUTS--PROPORTION OF KERNEL\r\n\r\n  Ratio of weight of kernel to weight of entire nut (without husk)\r\n  Highest, Ten Eyck 36.4%; Lowest, Seefeldt, 16%.\r\n\r\n  Percent of Kernel.

It is very\r\nmuch to be desired that methods for measuring this be worked out and\r\nseveral lines on which to work in order to accomplish it have been\r\nthought of but as yet no definite progress has been made.\r\n\r\nWhile the characteristic as yet unmeasured is one of the most important\r\nand most difficult even for experts to estimate correctly when there are\r\nlarge numbers of nuts to be examined, the fact that it is possible to\r\nmeasure the other eight is a matter of a good deal of satisfaction and\r\nthis satisfaction is the greater because with the methods that have been\r\nworked out it is possible for any ordinarily careful person to do the\r\nwork about as well as it is for an expert and, as the work of judging a\r\nlarge number of nuts is very considerable, the elimination of a large\r\npart of the need for expert services is very gratifying. The services\r\nfor example of such experts as Dr. Morris and Capt. Deming are\r\nobtainable only occasionally and for a short period. Now that the nuts\r\nsent in are rapidly increasing, it would have been impossible to have\r\nhandled the contests without some improvements in the methods used.\r\n\r\nWhile the same score card has been used for butternuts, black walnuts,\r\nand hickories it seemingly can be used quite well for English walnuts,\r\nJapan walnuts and pecans also, in short, for all nuts belonging to the\r\nbotanical family Juglandaceae and perhaps for hazels. Separate ones will\r\nevidently be required for beechnuts, and chestnuts. The tables for\r\ndetermining the number of points to be awarded for a given value of any\r\ncharacteristic are likely to vary for each species. Inasmuch as there\r\nare fourteen species of hickories exclusive of the pecan that have to be\r\nconsidered and apparently even more species of walnuts not to mention\r\nbeechnuts, chestnuts and hazels, one might think that nearly 100 tables\r\nwould be required. A study of the matter, however, has shown that the\r\nnumber really needed is very much less, and the more that nuts are\r\nexamined the more it seems possible to make one table answer for a\r\nnumber of species and have the number of points a nut receives indicate\r\nto a certain extent its value as a nut to grow, and not simply the value\r\nof a given variety of a certain species.\r\n\r\nThe hickories and the walnuts require a word in passing. There are at\r\nleast nine species of hickory either native in the northeastern United\r\nStates or that will grow there and it is quite possible that further\r\nstudy of the hickories will add to this number. Seven of these\r\nbelong to the scale bud class, _Eucarya_, the shagbark, _Carya ovata_,\r\nthe shellbark, _Carya laciniosa_, the scaly bark, _Carya\r\nCarolinae-septentrionalis_, the mockernut, _Carya alba_, and the\r\nclose-bark pignut, _Carya glabra_, the loose-bark pignut,\r\n_Carya-ovalis_, and the pallid hickory, _Carya pallida_; while two\r\nbelong to the open bud class, _Apocarya_, the pecan, _Carya pecan_, and\r\nthe bitternut, _Carya cordiformis_. Hybrids between many of these\r\nspecies are found occurring naturally and seemingly hybrids between any\r\ntwo are possible, and the fact of many of them being hybrids is not\r\nevident on an inspection of the nuts. It is a noteworthy fact that quite\r\na proportion of fine hickories that are being propagated are evidently\r\nhybrids and the number of our fine hickories which are evidently hybrids\r\nincreases as they are studied more carefully. In many ways it would be\r\ndesirable in the contest to offer prizes for the best nuts of each\r\nspecies of hickories, but the difficulty of determining the species from\r\nthe nut alone, and the fact of such a proportion of our finest nuts\r\nbeing hybrids is sufficient to discourage the attempt. What was done in\r\nthe 1918 contest, and what would seem to be the best thing that can be\r\ndone is to offer the prizes for hickory nuts simply. Most of the prizes\r\nare taken by shagbarks but when a nut not a shagbark gets into the prize\r\nwinning class, we make a class that would include it. For example, in\r\nthe 1918 Contest, three shellbarks and one mockernut came into the prize\r\nwinning class, whereupon a special lot of prizes for shellbarks and\r\nmockernuts were given. This enables us to do what would be accomplished\r\nin offering prizes for best nuts of each species of hickories. The same\r\nscore card and tables therefore are used for each of these species. It\r\nis convenient, in judging nuts, to differentiate between the pecan on\r\nthe one hand and the other hickories on the other, although study\r\nrecently put on the matter would seem to show that this distinction is\r\nnot exact and that some nuts, for example, which apparently are pure\r\npecans are really pecan hickory hybrids.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the structure of the shell of the nuts of\r\ncertain of the walnuts is greater than between the shell structure of\r\nthe hickories and the walnuts may be divided into three classes. Hybrids\r\nbetween a number of species are found which have been formed naturally,\r\nand seemingly hybrids between all species are possible. It is convenient\r\nin judging nuts to differentiate between English walnuts, black walnuts,\r\nand butternuts, which nuts are representative of the three walnut\r\nclasses and to include with the butternuts, the Japan walnuts. This will\r\nstrike many people as a strange classification, i. e. to include the\r\nbutternut and Japan walnut, but I feel sure that no one who has given\r\nthe matter much study will so consider it. Whenever the two grow in\r\nproximity they hybridize so freely that one may be almost certain of not\r\ngetting pure species if he plants nuts and raises seedlings. Indeed I\r\nhave received many such hybrids which have been called either butternuts\r\nor Japan walnuts. As a matter of fact the same difficulty exists in\r\ndistinguishing butternuts and Japan walnuts that exists in\r\ndistinguishing hickories. There is no name which includes the butternut\r\nand Japan walnut as there is to include the various species of\r\nhickories, and, as such a name is urgently needed, I have used the word\r\n\"butterjaps.\" This includes butternuts, Japan walnuts and hybrids\r\nbetween them. While it doubtless will be convenient to continue the\r\nnames butternut and Japan walnut it should be understood that usually\r\nthey will mean simply nuts which, as far as appearance is concerned,\r\nwould seem to be one or the other, but very likely may be hybrids\r\nbetween the two species and might be more properly called by some name\r\ne. g. \"butterjaps,\" which would include the two species and hybrids\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nAt this point the Convention took a recess to enable a photograph to be\r\ntaken and immediately after reassembled for a business session.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] An additional lot of Alley Black Walnuts received several months\r\nafter the one entered in the 1918 contest did not show 100% cracking\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS SESSION\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT W. C. REED IN THE CHAIR\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: If Mr. Patterson is in the room, we will be\r\nglad to hear from him at this time. He has a matter he wants to bring\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nMR. PATTERSON: Mr. President and Gentlemen: The National Nut\r\nGrowers Association for some three years have had a standing committee\r\non federal aid for the nut industry. Two years ago through the\r\ninstrumentality of that committee, the appropriation for investigational\r\nwork was increased by some fifteen thousand dollars from the previous\r\nappropriation. The total appropriation along this line now is thirty\r\nthousand to thirty-five thousand dollars. During the past year the\r\nalmond growers felt the need of some encouragement and help from the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, and the last appropriation was increased but\r\nwas not made specific for the pecan industry, but for the nut industry\r\nin general in the United States which was entirely agreeable to the\r\npecan people. And now I appear before you especially to call your\r\nattention to this movement and to suggest that this association should\r\nappoint a committee to co-operate with a committee from the National Nut\r\nGrowers' Association and the Almond Growers' Association, and the nut\r\ngrowers of Washington and Oregon in an effort to secure an appropriation\r\nfrom the Department of Agriculture which would commensurate with the\r\nneeds of the great nut industry in the United States. As we all know, it\r\nis entirely in its infancy as a commercial proposition and I doubt not\r\nwe all agree as to its wonderful possibilities. The recommendation from\r\nthe Secretary of the Department of Agriculture has gone to the House\r\ncommittee this year without any increase over the appropriation of last\r\nyear; so that it will be necessary if any increased allowance is made,\r\nthat pressure shall be brought to bear upon the House committee of\r\nagriculture, or the Senate committee (the bill is before the House\r\ncommittee at present), to get them to appreciate the importance of this\r\nappropriation. I might say I am on my way to Washington now to see if I\r\ncan do anything in co-operation with the California Almond Growers\r\nAssociation and such other co-operation as we can get to see if we can\r\nget an increase in the appropriation over and above the appropriation\r\nrecommended by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary is not\r\nopposed to a higher appropriation, but he has had orders from higher up\r\nnot to recommend any increase. I thank you for the privilege of bringing\r\nthis matter to the attention of the Association with the suggestion\r\nthat, if it meets with your approval you appoint a committee to\r\nco-operate with the other committees already appointed by these other\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: You have heard the suggestion by Mr. Patterson.\r\nAre there any remarks?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I move, Mr President, that a committee on Federal\r\nAid be appointed for that purpose, to co-operate with the other\r\nassociations for the purpose of securing for the nut industry an\r\nappropriation sufficient or at least somewhere near sufficient for the\r\nwork in hand. There is much work to be done that should be done now.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I second the motion, Mr. President.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: You have heard the motion. It is moved that a\r\ncommittee be appointed for this work, as suggested. All in favor of the\r\nmotion say Aye. Contrary same sign. It is CARRIED. I think it\r\nwould be well to leave that committee to the incoming president. That\r\nwas your idea, Mr. Bixby, was it?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I didn't think that far.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: That won't be far off, and I think it would be\r\nwell to leave the appointment of that committee to the incoming\r\npresident. I think also, it would be well, before appointing that\r\ncommittee, to confer a little bit to see who could possibly attend,\r\ncould go to Washington, and would have the time to give to it.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: We will now have the report of the nominating\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nYour committee on Nominations, having in mind the rapidly expanding\r\ninterest in Nut Culture and the need of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation for a board of officers especially equipped for extending\r\ndevelopment on broad lines, respectfully submit the following\r\nnominations:\r\n\r\n  _For President_--WILLIAM S. LINTON, Saginaw, Michigan.\r\n  _For Vice-President_--JAMES S. MCGLENNON, Rochester, New York.\r\n  _For Secretary-Treasurer_--WILLARD G. BIXBY, Baldwin, New York.\r\n  _For Acting Secretary_--DR. W. C. DEMING, Wilton, Connecticut.\r\n  _For Executive Committee_--MESSRS. LINTON, MCGLENNON, BIXBY,\r\n                                  W. C. REED, AND J. RUSSELL SMITH.\r\n\r\n  (Signed)   Ralph T Olcott\r\n             James S. McGlennon\r\n             Robert T Morris\r\n             William S. Linton\r\n             J. F. Jones\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: Secretary-Treasurer Bixby has suggested that the\r\nwork of his office be divided, he to look after the financial affairs\r\nand the nut contests, Dr. Deming to assume the work of the Secretary\r\nproper. The constitution provides that the three principal officers and\r\nthe last two retiring presidents be the executive committee. As the\r\nconstitution specifically provides regarding this matter, the committee\r\nsuggests the position of acting secretary for Dr. Deming until such\r\naction may be taken as will conform to the constitution.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: You have heard the report of the committee.\r\nWhat is your pleasure?\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: I move that this report of the committee be\r\nunanimously adopted and the officers be elected, and the secretary so\r\ncast the ballot.\r\n\r\nMR. SMEDLEY: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: All in favor of that vote say Aye. Opposed, No.\r\nCARRIED. I hereby instruct the secretary to cast the unanimous\r\nballot of the Association for the list of officers as read.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary then cast a ballot for the persons on the report of the\r\nNominating Committee, and declared the following elected:\r\n\r\n  _President_--WILLIAM S. LINTON, Saginaw, Mich.\r\n  _Vice-President_--JAMES S. MCGLENNON, Rochester, N. Y.\r\n  _Secretary-Treasurer_--WILLARD G. BIXBY, Baldwin, New York.\r\n  _Executive Committee_--The above three and W. C. REED, Vincennes,\r\n                              Ind., and J. RUSSELL SMITH, Swarthmore, Penn.\r\n  _Acting Secretary_--DR. W. C. DEMING, Wilton, Conn.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: In regard to the change in the constitution,\r\nthat will have to go over until next year.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: The constitution provides that notice be given to\r\nthis convention for action to be taken a year from now; or that thirty\r\ndays before action is taken, the notice be sent to the members. It seems\r\nto me that inasmuch as the action proposed is fully understood, that\r\nDr. Deming is available, and Mr. Bixby kindly consented while Dr. Deming\r\nwas tied up in the war work to look after this work, that there really\r\nis enough for two, and as both are agreeable, this is the time to take\r\nthat action to become effective a year from now unless you can bring it\r\nabout quicker.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I should think it is only necessary to take the\r\naction on that. If there is some one better posted on parliamentary law,\r\nwho thinks entire action better be taken at this time, I will entertain\r\na motion. If not, we will let it stand as it is at present.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I move that it is the sentiment of this convention,\r\nand that the members should be notified through the annual report and\r\nthe regular proceedings, that that action is contemplated--to divide the\r\noffice of Secretary-Treasurer at the next annual meeting, and that the\r\nconstitution be changed as follows:\r\n\r\nThat Article IV, _Officers_, be changed as follows: There shall be a\r\npresident, a vice-president, a treasurer and a secretary, who shall be\r\nelected at the annual meeting; and an executive committee of six persons\r\nof which the president, two last retiring presidents, vice-president,\r\ntreasurer and secretary shall be members. There shall be a state\r\nvice-president from each state, dependency, or county represented in the\r\nmembership of the association, who shall be appointed by the president.\r\n\r\nThat Article VII, _Quorum_, be changed as follows: Ten members of the\r\nassociation shall constitution a quorum, but must include a majority of\r\nthe executive committee, or two of the four elected officers.\r\n\r\nVOICE: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: It is moved and seconded that this matter come\r\nup at the next annual meeting to be voted on as presented by Mr. Olcott.\r\nAll in favor say Aye; opposed, No. CARRIED. I believe we have a\r\nreport of the auditing committee that should come up.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: Mr. Chairman, I believe I am the sole member of\r\nthe Auditing Committee who is present. I have to report that the\r\ncommittee has not acted, but I think we can do this if agreeable: If you\r\nwill leave it to the committee to audit the account, and if the\r\ncommittee finds the account is not accurate, to report to that effect\r\nnext year and bring Mr. Bixby to time, then; otherwise say nothing about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I think we are willing to do it on that basis.\r\nMr. Secretary, are there any other things that ought to come up that you\r\nthink of?\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I have a resolution here if this is in order now.\r\nThis resolution is sent from Mr. Littlepage.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas this Association is justly jealous of its character and\r\nstanding among the nut-growing public of this western continent and\r\nespecially among the northern nut culturists, amateur or professional;\r\nand\r\n\r\n\"Whereas this Association views with distrust and some alarm the growing\r\nand questionable practice of selling seedling pecan trees to the general\r\npublic; and\r\n\r\n\"Whereas it developed at a recent meeting of the Southern Nurserymen's\r\nAssociation held at Atlanta, Georgia, that seedling pecan trees from the\r\ngulf states were being distributed in the territory north of the Ohio\r\nRiver; and\r\n\r\n\"Whereas this practice, if continued, will work a distinct disadvantage\r\nto the industry in general as well as to the planters in particular;\r\n\r\n\"Therefore be it RESOLVED, That this Association now and here\r\nvigorously record its view on this question as follows: That we protest\r\nagainst the above named practice and urge upon the nurserymen of the\r\nUnited States the importance of discouraging the practice of planting\r\nseedling pecan trees for orchard purposes in particular; and further\r\nthat especially shall extreme caution be used to prevent the shipment of\r\nsouthern seedling pecan trees for planting in the territory north of the\r\nOhio and Potomac Rivers, and further be it\r\n\r\n\"RESOLVED, That the secretary communicate a _copy_ of these\r\nresolutions to the President of the American Association of Nurserymen\r\nwith the request that his organization take cognizance of this condition\r\nand take such steps as are compatible with its authority and sentiment\r\nto repress such reprehensible practice on the part of the American\r\nnursery trade.\"\r\n\r\nI will introduce this as a resolution.\r\n\r\nVOICE: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: You have heard the resolution which has been\r\nseconded. Are there any remarks?\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: I would like to add a word of explanation.\r\nThere are only two or three nurserymen in the South engaged in that\r\npractice. There are several northern men who are in the nursery business\r\nin the South who have raised the question as to the propriety of that\r\npractice, and the question has been discussed at the meetings of this\r\nsouthern association with a good deal of heat and vigor. The southern\r\npeople will not plant seedling pecan trees at all, but these few\r\nnurserymen do a few hundred dollars' worth of business every year by\r\nsending their product to big nurseries here in the North, general\r\nfruit-tree nurseries and they in turn distribute these trees through the\r\nNorth. These northern friends of ours who are now in the South, put\r\nthrough a resolution asking that the matter be discussed at their\r\nmeeting this year at Atlanta, the meeting held in August, by myself\r\nrepresenting the Department of Agriculture. I was unable to be present,\r\nbut I sent down a paper which was read by my associate in the office,\r\nand he tells us that ninety per cent of the southern nurserymen were\r\nwith us in opposing that practice; that it is only those two or three\r\nand their associates who practice it. And it is as a result of that\r\nsituation that this resolution has been proposed. Prof. Lake, secretary\r\nof the American Pomological Society, has been in the South working on\r\npecans and is quite familiar with the situation, and he drew up this\r\nresolution. It is something that by all means should be stopped if\r\npossible. The southern pecan does not succeed in the North anyhow, and\r\neven it did, we do not want the kind of pecan tree up here that the\r\nsoutherners would not plant themselves.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: Are you ready for the question? All in favor of\r\nadopting the resolution as read, say Aye. Contrary, same sign. It is so\r\nCARRIED.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: I would like to suggest that a copy of these\r\nresolutions be sent to the secretary of the Southern Nurserymen's\r\nAssociation, Mr. O. Joe Howard, Hickory, N. C.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I have a telegram from Mr. Littlepage which I will\r\nread. \"I regret exceedingly it is impossible to attend the meeting this\r\nyear. Signed, T. P. Littlepage.\"\r\n\r\nMR. J. F. JONES: I make a motion that Dr. Walter Van Fleet be\r\nmade an honorary member of this Association for his valuable work in nut\r\nculture and hybridizing.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: It has been moved and seconded that Dr. Walter\r\nVan Fleet be made an honorary member of this Association for his\r\nvaluable work in nut culture. All in favor say Aye. Contrary, No. It is\r\nCARRIED.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: The place of the next meeting is decided before the\r\nmeeting adjourns, I think, or else provision made for it.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: As I understand it, it is either decided or you\r\nvote to put it in the hands of the executive committee.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: Provision in some way is made for it. On that\r\nsubject I would like to say a word. We have an invitation from Mr.\r\nLittlepage, and in considering the place of the 1919 meeting there were\r\nreally three different locations spoken of--one Washington, D. C., one\r\nNew York City or some point near there, and one Lancaster, Pa.\r\nHeretofore we have practically decided the place of the meeting on\r\nconsideration of being able to see near there nut trees of interest. I\r\nthink every meeting has been decided with that idea in mind. This year\r\neach of the three places offered promise of being very attractive in a\r\nyear or two, but not in 1919. In the case of the meeting at Washington,\r\nwe could see Mr. Littlepage's orchard of pecans, thirty acres in extent,\r\nwhich year before last put out a few flowers, and this year quite a\r\nnumber, and he expects nuts next year. There are also the many things to\r\nbe seen around Washington,--the Department of Agriculture, and Dr. Van\r\nFleet's work besides a number of other things. And at Lancaster, Pa.,\r\nthere has been a chance the past year to see some remarkable work on top\r\nworked hickories, that is, the early bearing of crops of fine nuts. Then\r\nagain very soon on Capt. Deming's place at Georgetown, Conn., is going\r\nto be the greatest opportunity for topworked hickories anywhere to be\r\nseen. He has more young seedling hickories top worked to fine varieties\r\nthan any one else that I know of. As a matter of suggestion it would\r\nseem to me well--this is only a suggestion, of course--that the matter\r\nbe left with the executive committee, and next spring or summer when it\r\nis possible to get an idea as to which of these three places offers the\r\nmost to see in the line of nut trees, then they could decide where it is\r\nbest to go. That would be the suggestion that I would make.\r\n\r\nMR. MCGLENNON: One of the suggestions was Rochester, N. Y. I\r\nthink there are things worth while there in nut culture to be seen, and\r\nI know that we who are interested in nut culture would like to have the\r\nconvention there; and I know also our Chamber of Commerce in the city\r\nwould be very happy to have it there. So that in considering the place\r\nfor the next meeting, I hope Rochester, N Y., will be incorporated in\r\nthe thought.\r\n\r\nMR. POMEROY: Mr. President, I would also suggest you might come\r\nto Lockport, N. Y. Out northeast of Buffalo there were shipped eighteen\r\nhundred pounds of walnuts to the Buffalo market this fall. North of\r\nLockport is a man who supplies the country stores with English walnuts.\r\nAs long as there are any of these walnuts in the baskets exposed for\r\nsale, those which were purchased from the wholesalers from California\r\nare left unsold. I went into one store and the store-keeper had some\r\nhome grown English walnuts out in the back room. I said, \"Why do you\r\nkeep them out here?\" He said, \"I have three bushels of California\r\nwalnuts, and I keep these here until the others are sold. If I put these\r\nout in front, I would not sell the others at all.\"\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: I would be glad to include Rochester, or Lockport,\r\nor any other place suggested, and leave it to the executive committee\r\nwith the power to act.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: Mr. President, we know pretty nearly what could\r\nbe seen at most of these places next year. There is not going to be a\r\ngreat change in what there has been this year, and it seems to me the\r\nsooner we can definitely decide upon this thing and get it a matter of\r\nrecord, and plan for it, the better it will be. We can go around from\r\none place to another. We want to go to all these places during the next\r\nthree or four years, and we have a definite invitation from Mr.\r\nLittlepage; and while he didn't so state in his telegram, in\r\nconversation with him on Friday by telephone, he said he would like to\r\nhave them come there the latter part of August or first of September;\r\nand to make the matter definite and know where we stand early in the\r\ngame, I move we accept Mr. Littlepage's invitation for a meeting about\r\nthe first of September.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I second that motion, and add that at the Stamford\r\nconvention, that is the very argument I made. Before that meeting it had\r\nalways been left to the executive committee. It had been the custom of\r\nDr. Deming, the secretary, to defer the matter of the place of meeting\r\nuntil a few weeks before the date for it. Nobody knew, and the committee\r\ndecided, and the time was too short to get anything like the attendance\r\nwe should have. If we should publish in the American Nut Journal for a\r\nyear where the meeting is to be, you would get a year's advertising of\r\nthat matter, and could plan better thereby.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: You have heard the motion.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: The only reason I had in making the suggestion I\r\ndid, was the possibility of one place or the other showing more\r\nimportance but as Mr. Reed said, we want to do all these places\r\nmentioned at some time. It does not make much difference which we do\r\nfirst. We should like to take first the place where there is most to be\r\nseen, of course.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: If there is no further discussion, all in favor\r\nof accepting Mr. Littlepage's invitation for Washington for the next\r\nmeeting say Aye. Contrary, No. It is CARRIED.\r\n\r\nJ. F. JONES: The reason I did not push Lancaster is that some\r\nexperiments on spraying are being conducted there and it will be a year\r\nbefore that will show up. The nut growers could see that better the year\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: If there is nothing else, I believe we are\r\nready to turn over the gavel to our new president.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. REED: Mr. President, there is an important committee\r\nyou have not appointed. I was out of the room when Mr. Patterson\r\nsuggested this morning that a committee be appointed. Has that been\r\nattended to?\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I expected to let the incoming president\r\nappoint that committee before we adjourn.\r\n\r\nMR. SMEDLEY: I will make a motion that Mr. Patterson represent\r\nus and have the endorsement of this Association as to demanding more\r\nappropriations for the work in hand.\r\n\r\nJ. F. JONES: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: It is moved and seconded that Mr. Patterson be\r\nappointed to represent us before congress in connection with the\r\nappropriation.\r\n\r\nMR. PATTERSON: If everyone on the committee could go to\r\nWashington as soon as we can get at the House committee for a hearing,\r\nthat would be the way to get action on the matter. Of course, the\r\nendorsement of the Association is good, and if you could get a committee\r\nof some one who could go down and help re-enforce it, there, we would\r\nappreciate it very much.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT REED: I think the incoming president will be one who\r\nwill be going down. If he will come forward, I am ready to turn over the\r\ngavel.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Mr. Linton, the newly elected president, took the chair.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINTON: Ladies and Gentlemen I am sure that you will\r\nall concede that I have not sought official position, and no one could\r\nhave been more surprised than I, when I was presented with the report of\r\nyour committee. I have been much interested in the work that is being\r\ncarried on by this association; and of course if I can be of any value\r\nto the association or to the cause in the position of president during\r\nthis particular year, why I accept that duty. But I would like to impose\r\none or two conditions. I know that your hearty co-operation will be\r\ngiven. That would be one condition. But I am sure that each and every\r\none of you can assist in adding greatly to the membership of this\r\norganization. We should at least have fifty members in each state within\r\nour jurisdiction. That would mean, perhaps one-half of the states in the\r\nUnion. That would mean one thousand members. Now, in accepting this\r\nposition, I am going to ask each and every active member through his\r\nfriends and acquaintances to solicit and secure twenty-five members.\r\nNow, I will double that amount, and agree during the year, to add fifty\r\ngood members to the association. That means over one thousand during the\r\nyear, and that is one goal that I hope we can reach during this\r\nparticular year, 1920. So far as the growing of nuts is concerned, so\r\nfar as the details connected with the work that you have been engaged in\r\nis concerned, I propose leaving those things to those whom I consider\r\nexperts, Dr. Morris, our friend Reed from Washington, and others that I\r\nmight name; but the particular lines that I would like to follow this\r\nyear, gentlemen, and what I hope to receive your earnest support in is\r\nan addition to your membership so that it may exceed a thousand; and\r\nassistance in legislation throughout the country along the line that we\r\nhave worked out in our peninsular state of Michigan. I am glad that you\r\ndecided upon Washington as the place of the next meeting, and as I have\r\nintimated in my remarks heretofore, I believe we have there a Michigan\r\nSenator who will assist in national legislation along the lines that we\r\ndesire, because they are right ones; and in his position as chairman of\r\nthe committee on post offices and post roads of the country, being at\r\nthe head of the highway legislation, there is no man in the United\r\nStates as competent to help us along that line, and I feel sure that we\r\nwill get that assistance and support. With these few lines I will close,\r\nand I sincerely hope you have not made any mistake at this session; and\r\nwhen we have rounded up our year's work, that we can all say it has been\r\na successful one. I thank you. (Applause). The committee on Federal Aid\r\nthat the incoming president was to appoint, I will name as follows: J.\r\nM. Patterson, Dr. Morris, Dr. Kellogg, Mr. Littlepage, Mr. Bixby, Mr.\r\nJones and Mr. McGlennon.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: Senator Penney would like to say a word.\r\n\r\nSENATOR PENNEY: I hadn't any intention of saying a word. But I\r\nam particularly pleased that you elected my friend, Mr. Linton, as\r\npresident of the organization. I have known him a good many years, and I\r\nknow he is an industrious worker. In anything that he undertakes to do,\r\nyou will always see results. I am sure that in the lines which he has\r\nexpressed himself as being anxious to cover, your membership, the\r\nmatter of legislation, I am sure that you will see some results that\r\nwill be very gratifying to the Association. I do not know as there is\r\nanything further I wish to say. But I have been very interested in these\r\nmeetings. I am not a nut grower, and I hardly know one nut from another,\r\nexcepting that I am like the squirrel, if I get hold of a good nut I\r\nlike to eat it; but I have certainly learned a lot of things from this\r\nassociation, and I am very pleased to be present.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINTON: I am going to ask Senator Penney to become a\r\nmember of this association.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: He is a member.\r\n\r\nSENATOR PENNEY: I have gotten two since I have been here, so I\r\nam going to pledge myself for two or three more for the next year.\r\n\r\nMR. OLCOTT: I think one subject should not be overlooked, and\r\nthat is the matter of resolutions. There is Dr. Kellogg's very courteous\r\noffer and treatment to be remembered, and perhaps some other things. If\r\nthere is not such a committee, I think some one ought to be appointed on\r\nit to report very soon before we close. I move that a committee on\r\nresolutions be appointed.\r\n\r\nC. A. REED: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINTON: Gentlemen, you have heard the motion made by\r\nMr. Olcott. Are you ready for the question? Those who favor the motion\r\nsay Aye; opposed, No. The resolution is ADOPTED. I appoint Mr.\r\nOlcott, Mr. Bixby, Senator Penney, Mr. Jones and Mr. Patterson.\r\n\r\nC. A. REED: There is a little bit of news I would like to tell\r\nthe members of the association. Yesterday afternoon, a gentleman who is\r\na patient across the street at the sanitarium, came down to the nut\r\nexhibit in a wheelchair and looked on with interest at what was shown\r\nthere, and presently he called Mrs. Reed over to talk with her a little\r\nand ask something about who was connected with that exhibit; and the\r\nnext thing he asked me to sit down by him. He was not able to get\r\naround, to stand, and he told me this: that four years ago he met a Mr.\r\nPage from Tulsa, Oklahoma, a man who is evidently a man of a good deal\r\nof means in the oil business there, who is very philanthropic in his\r\nactivities, a man who has adopted two hundred children, I believe it is;\r\nand he proposed to this gentleman, who was Mr. Dow of Jamestown, N. Y.,\r\nthat he go to Oklahoma to establish a nut arboretum. He was willing to\r\nset aside two hundred acres of land and to endow it with $200,000 if\r\nthis Mr. Dow would go and take charge of it. He also offered to build a\r\n$23,000 house on the place. But Mr. Dow is director of the Leadsworth\r\nForest Arboretum, some sixty miles up the Genesee River from Rochester,\r\nand of course he did not feel that he could leave the work he was doing\r\nthere and devote his energies to a new work. I thought that was\r\nsomething that we northerners would be very much interested in, and I\r\nthink we ought to see if that offer could not be taken advantage of.\r\n\r\nMR. BIXBY: Can any one here tell me where seedlings of the big\r\nwestern shellback, Carya laciniosa, can be obtained? I would like to get\r\n100 of them.\r\n\r\nC. A. REED: Probably the best place to get that information\r\nwould be from the U. S. Forest Service. That bureau keeps in touch with\r\nsuch information. They have catalogs and they have lists of nurserymen\r\nhaving various trees including nut trees; the U. S. Forest Service,\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINTON: Mr. Reed informs me that it is the intention\r\nto close this session at this time.\r\n\r\nJ. F. JONES: I don't think we ought to close without passing a\r\nresolution of thanks to Dr. Kellogg for the nice entertainment here, the\r\nfree service, the rooms, etc.\r\n\r\nVOICE: I support the motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINTON: You have heard the motion offered by Mr.\r\nJones. We can take a recess and adjourn after we take the trip through\r\nthe buildings.\r\n\r\nC. A. REED: If there is no one there but the president,\r\nofficers and the committee, they would still have the authority to adopt\r\nthese resolutions, and then properly adjourn.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINTON: If that is the consensus of opinion, we will\r\ntake a recess until called to order again by the chair following the\r\ntrip through the buildings.\r\n\r\nC. A. REED: The idea was to take a recess until after our trip\r\nthis afternoon and adjourn then. At that time this committee will be\r\nprepared with its resolutions.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINTON: We can not fix a definite time. It will be\r\nfollowing the afternoon session with Dr. Kellogg. If there is nothing\r\nmore to come before us at this time, a recess will be taken until after\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nThe convention then took a recess and reassembled at 2 p. m. at which\r\ntime an old fashioned straw sleigh ride was taken to the buildings of\r\nthe Kellogg Pure Food Company. Here Dr. Kellogg met the party and\r\nconducted them through, explaining the various products made and the\r\nprocesses by which they were made, and also that the large plant of the\r\ncompany was a growth from a very humble beginning, started originally\r\nfor the purpose of providing food for the Sanitarium that was impossible\r\nto procure any other way. Persons who had been guests of the Sanitarium,\r\nafter leaving it, have wished to get some of the food products they had\r\nhad when there, and in that way, a demand was made which had grown, till\r\nmany of them were supplied to the jobbing trade. A most enjoyable lunch\r\nenabled the party to sample many of the products.\r\n\r\nFrom the Kellogg Pure Food Company, the sleigh took the party back to\r\nthe Sanitarium through which they were conducted and shown the\r\nremarkable facilities for providing the guests with every kind of\r\nmedical treatment that had proved valuable. It would be difficult to\r\nfind a place where apparatus for treating every form of disease is equal\r\nto that of the Battle Creek Sanitarium or where such facilities exist\r\nfor providing patients with all means for their comfort and for the\r\nrecovery of their health. A most interesting talk illustrated with\r\nlantern slides, showed the growth of this institution from a modest\r\nbeginning in a dwelling house, 54 years ago. After this the convention\r\nreassembled and adjourned at 5 p. m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE 1919 NUT CONTEST\r\n\r\nWILLARD G. BIXBY, BALDWIN, NASSAU CO., N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nuts sent in to the 1919 contest have been finished at last but the\r\ndate is only a few days ahead of the date last year when the 1918\r\ncontest was finished, which is to me a matter of a good deal of chagrin\r\nas it was last year. No attempt was made to examine the nuts received\r\ntill after the first of the year as the experience of last year showed\r\nthis to be a waste of time. Several things seemed, this year, to\r\nconspire to prevent getting started on the examination. The number of\r\nnuts received was large and the time taken for examination quite\r\nconsiderable for no attempt as yet has been made to have but one person\r\nwork on it. But the thing that has caused the greater part of the delay\r\nwas the wide variation between the results in the tests of those nuts\r\nwhich were sent into both the 1918 and 1919 contests, and my\r\nunwillingness to have these results appear in print until the reasons\r\nfor these discrepancies could be stated with certainty.\r\n\r\nHad the methods used been those in use for some time and whose\r\ncorrectness had been proven, these differences would have caused little\r\nconcern, but inasmuch as the methods for measuring most of the nut\r\ncharacteristics were used for the first time in 1918, and their had been\r\ndevised by me, I could not help feeling that there was a possibility of\r\nthe discrepancies being due to imperfections in methods for, at first,\r\nit would seem likely that nuts borne by a given tree one year would be\r\nlike those borne the next year. I considered therefore that it was for\r\nme to prove beyond question that the methods used were sound and that\r\nthe differences noted were real. The amount of time needed to do this at\r\na period when my time was well occupied with other things has been more\r\nthan I wish it had been. While many efforts were made to see if there\r\nwere imperfections in the methods used for measuring the various\r\ncharacteristics, no such imperfections were found, and, for a\r\nconsiderable period, all efforts made to explain the differences in\r\ntests made on nuts borne by the same trees in different years were\r\nunproductive of results. Finally the matter was settled to my\r\nsatisfaction as is noted in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Clark hickory received 79 points last year when it took the first\r\nprize. It tested out 11 points less this year when first tested which\r\nput it entirely out of the prize winning class. Repetition of this\r\nyear's tests gave results agreeing fairly well with the first ones made\r\nbut still not all comparable to those of last year. This was decidedly\r\ndisconcerting when one of the principal results expected of the adoption\r\nof methods of measuring nut characteristics was the possibility of\r\ntesting a given nut now and several months hence and obtaining the same\r\nverdict. After much work designed to see if the methods of measuring nut\r\ncharacteristics were faulty and nothing wrong had been found with them,\r\na visit was made to the tree. Mr. Clark said that it bore a good crop\r\nevery other year and but few nuts in the intervening years, and that the\r\nnuts were much better the years when a good crop was borne than they\r\nwere in the other years. This was interesting information but I could\r\nnot help realizing the difficulty of carrying in one's mind, from one\r\nyear to the next, the merits of hickory nuts, and felt that, unless the\r\nmatter could be proven, I had not as yet done very much to solve the\r\nproblem at hand. Mr. Clark, however, gave me practically all the nuts of\r\nthe 1919 crop which he had and I returned feeling that this trip had not\r\ndone much to solve the problem as to why the tests on the 1918 nuts and\r\n1919 nuts should be so different. Very careful examination was made of\r\nthe few Clark hickory nuts remaining in my possession of the 1918 crop\r\nand they were compared with those of the 1919 crop. Slight differences\r\nin shape were noted and finally one nut was found seemingly just like\r\nthe nuts that won the prize in 1918. When this nut was tested it gave\r\nsubstantially the same results as those tested in 1918. Another like it\r\nwas afterward found where the result was repeated. This proved\r\ndefinitely that the trouble was not with the methods, and that, in off\r\nyears, with the Clark hickory at least, some few nuts were borne that\r\nwould test out as well as those borne in good years. The results of the\r\ntests on these good nuts borne in 1919 were substituted for those on the\r\ninferior nuts previously tested for in contests it is always the\r\nintention of those sending in nuts to send in the best.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the number of points finally awarded the Clark\r\nhickory for example this year is less than awarded last year. This\r\ndifference is due to the method of scoring. In a matter as new as\r\nmethods for measuring nut characteristics, the constants which have to\r\nbe determined by experience must change somewhat at first. The method\r\nused this year in testing nuts sent in to the contest was to judge them\r\non the basis used in 1918, redetermine the constants that required it,\r\nand work out the results again. An example will help to make this\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nTake the matter of proportion of kernel, the highest award for which was\r\n15 points in 1918 and also in 1919. Up to the time the 1918 contest was\r\ndecided the hickory with the largest proportion of kernel was the Beam,\r\nNut No. 3, of the 1918 contest with over 50% of kernel and the lowest\r\nwas the Brown mockernut of the 1918 contest with 18% of kernel. On the\r\nbasis of the difference between the highest and lowest the number of\r\npoints to be awarded each was worked out. On this basis the Clark\r\nhickory was awarded, in 1918, 10 points for a proportion of kernel of\r\n40.8%. In the case of the 1919 contest nuts with larger proportion of\r\nkernel were found, the Hatch bitternut with 65%, and the Halesite\r\nbitternuts with 69% kernel. A mockernut from Sliding Hill, Jackson, S.\r\nC. with only 14% kernel was also found and the figures for awarding\r\npoints for proportion of kernel were recalculated as follows:\r\n\r\n                              Points                                Points\r\n  69% and over                  15      65.3% to 68.9% inclusive      14\r\n  61.7% to 65.2% inclusive      13      58.0% to 61.6% inclusive      12\r\n  54.3% to 57.9% inclusive      11      50.7% to 54.2% inclusive      10\r\n  47.0% to 50.6% inclusive       9      43.3% to 46.9% inclusive       8\r\n  39.7% to 43.2% inclusive       7      36.0% to 39.6% inclusive       6\r\n  32.3% to 35.9% inclusive       5      28.7% to 32.2% inclusive       4\r\n  25.0% to 28.6% inclusive       3      21.3% to 24.9% inclusive       2\r\n  17.7% to 21.2% inclusive       1      14.0% to 17.6% inclusive       0\r\n\r\nOn this basis the Clark hickory was awarded but 7 points for the same\r\nproportion of kernel in 1919 instead of 10 as in 1918. This accounts for\r\n3 out of the 5 points difference between the 79 points awarded in 1918\r\nand the 74% in 1919. The other two points can be similarly explained.\r\nThere are bound to be similar changes in the tables for awarding points\r\nfrom year to year, but they will be less and less as time goes on. For\r\nexample, the Wasson butternut of the 1915 contest which weighed 18.8g\r\nwas the largest butternut received until 1919 when two larger came in,\r\none weighing 19.5g and the other weighing 22.6g. The Mott shellbark\r\nhickory which weighs 29.6g which was discovered by Dr. Morris before the\r\nfounding of the Association is still the largest hickory of which we\r\nknow. On the other hand the black walnut record for size was exceeded in\r\n1918 and also in 1919.\r\n\r\nThe nuts received were gone over carefully and all characteristics\r\nmeasured where this was possible, then the other characteristics were\r\npassed on by me. Then the best nuts were brought to the attention of Dr.\r\nMorris and Dr. Deming and the three of us passed on those\r\ncharacteristics where methods of measurement had not been worked out.\r\n\r\nThe results of this contest are noted in considerable detail as it is\r\nbelieved that they may have value as matters of record. While an attempt\r\nhas been made to give the species of each nut tested as such information\r\nis useful, it must be understood that the notations of species are\r\ntentative and subject to change should further knowledge require it. It\r\nis, frequently, difficult to positively identify a nut as to species\r\nwithout having leaves, buds, bark and husk for examination and in most\r\ninstances the judges did not have these. No nut is noted as a hybrid\r\nunless it has been proven so by evidence which it is believed is beyond\r\nquestion, yet there are a number of nuts noted as pure species which\r\nlater may be proved to be hybrids. This is particularly so in the case\r\nof the hickories.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the tables it should be noted that weights of nuts and\r\nkernels are expressed in grams, while cracking pressures are expressed\r\nin kilograms. The methods used for measuring the various characteristics\r\nare noted in detail in the article \"Judging Nuts\" on pages 122 to 132\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\nThe two items cracking quality need a little explanation. Last year 20\r\npoints were awarded for cracking quality and 5 points for plumpness of\r\nkernel. Plumpness was very difficult of estimation. It means the reverse\r\nof shrivelled. To assign values for this can only be done by appearance\r\nand it seemed impossible of measurement. A study of the nuts of the 1918\r\ncontest which were awarded high values for plumpness and those which\r\nwere awarded low values showed that in no case was a nut which had a\r\nshrivelled kernel awarded a high value for proportion of kernel.\r\nSometimes a nut with a plump kernel had a very thick shell and a low\r\nproportion of kernel but in no instance did a nut with a shrivelled\r\nkernel have a high proportion of kernel, so it was thought that for\r\npractical purposes the figure for proportion of kernel would answer very\r\nwell to represent excellence in both characteristics. It was also\r\nevident that the ratio of the weight of the portion of the kernel which,\r\nafter cracking, could be easily picked out with the fingers to the total\r\nweight of the kernel, which was taken to represent cracking quality last\r\nyear, was capable of more refinement for it was noticed that of those\r\nnuts where the entire kernel could be easily picked out with the fingers\r\nafter cracking that some were better crackers than others, for, in some\r\ninstances, the entire kernel fell out. As the proportion of the kernel\r\nwhich could be picked out easily with the fingers is seemingly the most\r\nimportant this was still given 20 points and called \"cracking quality\r\ncommercial,\" and the figure representing the proportion of kernel which\r\ndropped out after cracking was called \"cracking quality absolute,\" and\r\nawarded the 5 points formerly awarded to plumpness.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the hazel which generally has a cracking quality both\r\nabsolute and commercial of 100% the item \"freedom from fibre\" was\r\nsubstituted for \"cracking quality absolute.\" The hazel seems to be the\r\nonly nut where this characteristic must be considered.\r\n\r\nIt is too bad that while practically all characteristics are determined\r\nwith exactness to a single point and could be even more precisely\r\ndetermined, that the item quality and flavor of kernel to which 20\r\npoints are justly awarded has to be determined in so crude a manner as\r\nit is at present. It is true that formerly all characteristics were\r\ndetermined in equally crude manner and we should be glad that all others\r\ncan be determined with precision but still having one quality not\r\nprecisely determined, to a certain extent prevents exact determination\r\nof the others having the value it otherwise would. We can make only\r\nabout five graduations in quality which would be differences of five\r\npoints except at the top of the scale where it is 2 and an error in one\r\ngradation would make a difference of 5 points generally. When it is seen\r\nhow close some of the nuts run, particularly the hickories, where the\r\ndifferences in total points awarded are generally only 1 point, with\r\nseveral of the same score, this crudeness of determination of one of the\r\nmost important characteristics is the more regrettable.\r\n\r\nThe results of the 1919 contest on nuts of the various species are as\r\nnoted below:\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKORIES--128 ENTRIES\r\n\r\nThe results of the tests on the prize winning hickories are shown in the\r\ntable on page 151.\r\n\r\nWhat is said of the difficulty of identification as to species is\r\nparticularly applicable to the hickory where it is known that many of\r\nthe fine nuts that we have are hybrids. While no nut is noted as a\r\nhybrid unless it has been so proven by evidence which it is believed is\r\nbeyond question, there is considerable question as to whether a number\r\nof the nuts noted as shagbarks are really pure shagbarks. It will take\r\nmore observation and study than it has as yet been possible to give them\r\nto determine this point. It is to be noted, however, that the more study\r\nwe put on the hickories notable for the excellence of the nuts they\r\nbear, the more we find that give suggestion of hybrid parentage.\r\n\r\nBeside the hickories noted above which received a sufficient number of\r\npoints to entitle them to one of the eight prizes awarded the\r\nmeasurements are given of the Hatch and Halesite bitternuts because\r\nthey have the thinnest shell and highest proportion of kernel of any\r\nhickories yet discovered and of the Stanley hickory because it is the\r\nbest shellbark of which we yet know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKORIES\r\n\r\nKEY:\r\nA: Species\r\nB: Prize awarded\r\nC: Average weight of nut\r\nD: Average weight of kernel\r\nE: Average weight of kernel that dropped out after cracking\r\nF: Average weight of kernel that could be easily picked out with fingers\r\n   after cracking\r\nG: Average cracking pressure\r\nH: Proportion of kernel\r\nI: Cracking quality absolute\r\nJ: Cracking quality commercial\r\nK: Size (10)\r\nK: Form (5)\r\nM: Color of shell (5)\r\nN: Husking quality (5)\r\nO: Thinness of shell (10)\r\nP: Cracking quality commercial (20)\r\nQ: Cracking quality absolute (5)\r\nR: Color of kernel (5)\r\nS: Proportion of kernel (15)\r\nT: Quality of kernel (20)\r\nU: Total points awarded (100)\r\n\r\n|NAME\r\n|ADDRESS\r\n|DESIGNATION        | A | B |  C  | D  | E  | F  |  G  |  H  | I   |\r\n====================================================================\r\n|Luther W.

Where two letters appear with an x between it\r\nmeans that the nut in question is a hybrid between the two species.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing out the plan adopted last year (when no prizes were offered\r\nfor specific species of hickories) when a nut other than a shagbark sent\r\njudged by the hickory standard received sufficient points to put it\r\namong the prize winners, a special class was made for that. Some of the\r\nnuts in the above list are disqualified for receiving prizes as they are\r\nbeing \"propagated.\" This term has been somewhat difficult of definition\r\nand in default of action of the Association or of some committee\r\nappointed for the purpose I have held it to mean those nuts which are\r\nlisted in the catalog of any nurseryman. That is to say, a nut is\r\neligible for prizes more than one year, and the mere growing a few\r\ngrafted or budded trees of a variety and distributing them privately\r\ndoes not constitute \"propagation\" in the sense that the word is used in\r\nthe nut contests. As soon, however, as any nurseryman considers a\r\nvariety of sufficient merit so that he lists it is his catalog or in any\r\nprinted supplement to a catalog and states that he can furnish grafted\r\nor budded trees of this variety, from that time on it is debarred from\r\nreceiving the prizes offered annually.\r\n\r\nOther hickories were received from:\r\n\r\n  D.

There is but one species of walnuts of\r\nthe black walnut class native in the north eastern United States, the\r\neastern black walnut, _Juglans nigra_. In this contest specimens of the\r\nTexas black walnut, _Juglans rupestris_, and of the California black\r\nwalnut, _Juglans hindsii_ were entered. Tests on these two black walnuts\r\nare noted for the purpose of record although no characteristics of value\r\nwere noted. The California black walnut has a smoother shell than the\r\neastern black walnut. The Texas black walnut has beautiful willowy\r\nfoliage and grows very late in the fall and holds its leaves much longer\r\nthan the other walnuts and it is of dwarf habit of growth. Tests on the\r\nWerner black walnut are noted because it is the largest black walnut we\r\nhave. The black walnuts sent in this year were much poorer on the whole\r\nthan those exhibited in some years. Some well known trees bore scarcely\r\na nut. Some well known propagated black walnuts were tested but only two\r\nof them tested out high enough to get into the prize winning class, the\r\nThomas and Ten Eyck. From what we know of the variation of nuts\r\nparticularly of black walnuts, it is evident that we must test black\r\nwalnuts more than one year to get a good idea of their value.\r\n\r\nThe nut sent in by John S. Bomberges is particularly noticeable on\r\naccount of the unusually fine flavor of the kernel and would seem to be\r\na standard of excellence for black walnut kernels.\r\n\r\nOther black walnuts received from:\r\n\r\n  William A.

The need of a name to include these is apparent and the name\r\nbutterjaps to include butternuts, Japan walnuts, and hybrids between\r\nthem is used this year following out last year's suggestion. It was a\r\nvery poor year for these nuts, many well known trees bearing no crop at\r\nall. The one hybrid exhibited which was sent in as a curiosity not for\r\nthe purpose of being entered in the contest but it is interesting to\r\nnote that it took a prize, although not a high one.\r\n\r\nThe prize winning nuts and prizes awarded are noted in the table on page\r\n156.\r\n\r\n  Other butternuts received from:\r\n\r\n  C.

In\r\nthe case of hybrids the species first named is the pistillate parent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECANS--13 VARIETIES\r\n\r\nSome very good northern pecans were sent in to the 1918 contest and two\r\nof them are deemed worthy of experimental propagation. One of these Dunn\r\nNo. 1, had a particularly delicious flavor and the other the Koontz, was\r\nalso a desirable nut. They are not large but are almost exactly the size\r\nof the Moore pecan, a southern variety now attracting a good deal of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of three nuts of larger size were received, the Norton,\r\nMcCallister and Kline, but not in sufficient quantity to test. The\r\nweights are given for reference. Tests of nine standard southern pecans\r\nare also shown. It will be noticed that the best pecans sent to the 1919\r\ncontest compare very favorably with these fine southern pecans, only the\r\nSchley being shown superior. The northern pecans are generally smaller\r\nthan the southern, have lighter colored shell and lighter colored\r\nkernel, flavor every bit as good, and shell just as thin. The prize\r\nwinning nuts and the prizes awarded are shown in the table on page 158.\r\n\r\nThe results of tests of southern pecans is inserted with some\r\nhesitation. These pecans are judged by the same score cards as are the\r\nnorthern pecans which is the one used for hickories. Inasmuch as the\r\npecans, both northern and southern, are judged by the same standards, it\r\nis hoped that the figures may be of some value. The writer makes no\r\nclaim to being an expert on the southern pecan and does not wish these\r\nfigures taken as his opinion on the relative merits of southern pecans,\r\nwhich have been grown in orchard form long enough so that regularity of\r\nbearing, size of crops, resistance to disease, etc., have been\r\ndetermined to a considerable extent. These are of such importance to the\r\npractical pecan grower as to overbalance to quite an extent the merits\r\nof the nut itself which are the only qualities that can be considered in\r\na nut contest.\r\n\r\n  Other pecans received from:\r\n\r\n  G.

as I know,\r\nhas never been propagated in the sense in which the word is used in the\r\ncontests where it means listed in the catalog of some nurseryman who is\r\nprepared to furnish grafted or budded or layered plants. The value of\r\nthis hazel is now being recognized and doubtless it will not be long\r\nthat this will be the case for it is by far the best American hazel now\r\nknown. The prize winning nuts and the prizes awarded are shown in the\r\ntable on page 160.\r\n\r\nFollowing the list of American hazels are 9 varieties of Mr. Conrad\r\nVollertsen's, Rochester, N. Y., most of them of German origin. These are\r\ngiven with their German names. These names are given here for\r\nconvenience for readers and only for that, for they violate one of the\r\nrules followed in naming nuts. They will be referred to the nomenclature\r\ncommittee at its next session. Following Mr. Vollertsen's hazels are\r\nfive standard market hazels grown on the Pacific coast which are noted\r\nas matters of record.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the White Aveline hazel has been placed higher\r\nthan the Barcelona when judged by the score card used. Inasmuch as\r\norchards of White Aveline hazels in the Pacific northwest are being\r\nreplaced by Barcelona and Duchilly because White Aveline nuts are too\r\nsmall to be saleable commercially, it was questioned as to whether the\r\nscore card was not at fault and whether much more emphasis should not be\r\nput on size and less on quality than is the case with the score card\r\nused. Inasmuch as the same score card has been used for all nuts except\r\nwhere it seemed entirely unadapted (because when this was done the\r\nfigures have a value they otherwise would not in expressing the relative\r\nvalue of each species) it seems very desirable this common score card be\r\nretained for as many nuts as possible. There are some notable instances\r\nwhere fruits commercially important do not rank highest in quality, e. g.,\r\nthe Elberta peach, Ben Davis apple, and Kiefer pear, therefore it is\r\nthought better not to emphasize size too strongly in the case of hazels.\r\nIt is only fair to state, however, that much less work has been put on\r\njudging hazels than on some other nuts and perhaps our ideas will have\r\nto be revised later.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZELS\r\n\r\nKEY:\r\nA: Species\r\nB: Prize awarded\r\nC: Average weight of nut\r\nD: Average weight of kernel\r\nE: Average weight of kernel that dropped out after cracking\r\nF: Average weight of kernel that could be easily picked out with fingers\r\n   after cracking\r\nG: Average cracking pressure\r\nH: Proportion of kernel\r\nI: Cracking quality absolute\r\nJ: Cracking quality commercial\r\nK: Size (10)\r\nK: Form (5)\r\nM: Color of shell (5)\r\nN: Husking quality (5)\r\nO: Thinness of shell (10)\r\nP: Cracking quality commercial (20)\r\nQ: Cracking quality absolute (5)\r\nR: Color of kernel (5)\r\nS: Proportion of kernel (15)\r\nT: Quality of kernel (20)\r\nU: Total points awarded (100)\r\n\r\n|NAME\r\n|ADDRESS\r\n|DESCRIPTION            | A  | B |  C  | D  | E  | F  |  G  |  H  | I    |\r\n==========================================================================\r\n|J.

The results shown are given for what they\r\nare worth. A sufficient number of Persian walnuts have not as yet been\r\nexamined to enable us to determine the constants so that they are as\r\nvaluable as they will be later, and as they are on the hickories, black\r\nwalnuts, and butternuts where hundreds of nuts have been examined.\r\nConsequently, conclusions based on the figures in the table should be\r\nconservatively drawn. The position of the Franquette at the bottom of\r\nthe list of the propagated nuts it is believed will be materially\r\nchanged with the redetermination of the constants that an examination of\r\na large number of nuts would require.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\nThe number of entries in the 1919 contest was about 50% greater than in\r\n1918. No hickories, no black walnuts or butternuts deemed worthy of\r\nexperimental propagation appeared as was the case in 1918, but on the\r\nother hand, two pecans, the Dunn No. 1 and Koontz, it is believed, are\r\nwell worth while propagating experimentally even though the Dunn nut\r\ncomes from a somewhat more southern section than the other northern\r\npecans now being propagated. The need for additional heartnuts makes it\r\nseem advisable to propagate experimentally the Stranger heartnut, even\r\nthough it comes from Jackson, S. C., a section so far south that the\r\nsouthern pecan grows and bears well. The contest has helped to bring out\r\nthe value of the Rush hazel, which has been propagated experimentally\r\nfor a long time but which, so far as I know, has never been offered to\r\nthe public by nurserymen.\r\n\r\nThe following standards for hickories have been established: The largest\r\nnut found so far is still the Mott shellbark, which Dr. Morris found a\r\nnumber of years ago and which weighs 29.6g. The Vest hickory, which\r\namong the seemingly pure shagbarks, had the record of the thinnest\r\nshell up to the 1918 contest, has been surpassed by the Beam No. 1 of\r\nthe 1919 contest, which takes but 33kg to crack the shell. The figure is\r\nsurpassed by one bitternut hybrid the Beaver 29kg, and by the Hatch\r\nbitternut 19kg, and the Halesite bitternut 13kg. The Vest of the 1914\r\ncrop is still the seemingly pure shagbark with the largest percentage of\r\nkernel 57.7%. This is surpassed by the Hatch bitternut 65.0%, and the\r\nHalesite bitternut 69.0%. No hickory has been found to surpass the Vest\r\nin the excellence of flavor of the kernel. One hickory, the Barnes, 1919\r\ncontest, showed 100% cracking quality.\r\n\r\nThe following standards for black walnuts have been established. The\r\nArmknecht No. 2 which held the record last year has been surpassed by\r\nthe Werner with a weight of 30.4g. The thinnest shelled one is still the\r\nAlley of the 1918 contest, with a cracking pressure of 110kg, although\r\nthe Ten Eyck of the 1918 contest was only slightly higher, 120kg. The\r\nrecord for the greatest proportion of kernel is still with the Ten Eyck\r\nof the 1918 contest 36.4%. The Ten Eyck black walnut exhibited in 1919\r\nhad no such records of thinness of shell or proportion of kernel. The\r\nStabler is believed to be the best cracker but the Alley of the 1918\r\ncontest showed 100%. The Bomberges black walnut of the 1919 contest\r\nshowed unusually fine quality of kernel and is believed to hold the\r\nrecord for quality of kernel so far.\r\n\r\nThe following standards for butterjaps (i. e., butternuts, Japan walnuts\r\nand their hybrids) have been established. The Wasson butternut which\r\nheld the record for size heretofore 18.8g has been surpassed by two nuts\r\nPumfrey No. 2, 19.5g and Truman No. 4, 22.6g. The same high cracking\r\nquality among the pure butternuts noted last year still continues. The\r\nRitchie heartnut of the 1918 contest still holds the record for\r\npercentage of kernel, 32.7%. One pure butternut, the Kuhne of the 1919\r\ncontest, with 19% kernel has been found. The Aiken butternut 200kg\r\ncracking pressure is the thinnest shelled pure butternut yet found. The\r\nthinnest shelled Japan walnut yet found is the Wilson Seibold walnut of\r\nthe 1919 contest, 75kg cracking pressure.\r\n\r\nThe following standards for pecans have been established (including the\r\npecan x shellbark hybrids which generally resemble pecans in flavor and\r\nappearance and would be classed with them). Largest, the Klein, 22.0g in\r\nweight. Of the pure northern pecans the Norton, 8.1g in weight is the\r\nlargest. Of the pure southern pecans tested the Delmas 10.1g in weight\r\nis the largest. Of the northern pecans the greatest percentage of kernel\r\nyet found is the Clifford \"Sweetmeat\" of the 1919 contest, 57.6% of\r\nkernel, followed closely by the Koontz, 56.1% and the Dunn, 55.5%. Of\r\nthe southern pecans the Schley, 62%, leads.\r\n\r\nThe thinnest shelled northern pecan yet tested is the Wears of the 1919\r\ncontest, 21kg cracking pressure; the thinnest southern pecan is the\r\nBurkett, 27kg followed closely by the Schley 29kg. The finest flavored\r\namong the northern pecans is Dunn No. 1, which has a kernel which is\r\nexceptionally delicious. The finest flavored among the southern pecans\r\nis the Schley.\r\n\r\nThe following standards for hazels have been established. The largest\r\nAmerican hazel yet found is the Littlepage 2.7g but the Rush, although a\r\nsmaller nut has a larger kernel 1.0g against .8g for the Littlepage. The\r\nRush also has a greater proportion of kernel, 45.7%, than any other\r\nnative hazel yet tested or any foreign one excepting the White Aveline\r\nwhich has 49.3%. The thinnest shelled American hazel is the Rush 39kg\r\nand the thinnest shelled foreign one, the White Aveline 26kg.\r\n\r\nThose who have given the matter consideration are thoroughly convinced\r\nof the great possibilities of systematic hybridization of nut trees.\r\nWork of this kind will have to be carried on according to carefully\r\nthought out plans, the details of which are not yet quite clear in all\r\nparticulars. The facts brought out by this contest have added to our\r\nknowledge of what may be expected from our work. Take the hickory for\r\nexample; we have shellbark hickory nuts nearly three times the size of\r\nthe best southern pecans; we have bitternut hickory nuts with a\r\nproportion of kernel greater than that of any pecan and with shell so\r\nthin, that they can be cracked with less pressure than any pecans I have\r\never seen; we have in the best shagbarks, flavor of kernel unsurpassed\r\nin any nut. Theoretically, it should be possible to produce nuts in\r\nwhich these qualities are combined to a large degree. Similar\r\npossibilities exist with the butternut and the Japan walnut where it is\r\nseemingly possible to produce nuts in which the qualities of both will\r\nbe combined and get smooth, thin-shelled butternuts or well flavored\r\nJapan walnuts or desirable butterjaps, as I am inclined to call them.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the table of hickories show that 4 out of the 28\r\nreceiving 68 points or over, are certainly hybrids. There are a number\r\nof others where it seems very probable that they are hybrids. There are\r\na number of facts to suggest that some of our very thin shelled\r\nhickories, which at first sight seem to be shagbarks, are hybrids of\r\nwhich the shellbark or mockernut is one parent. Why the offspring of\r\nsuch thick shelled nuts as the shellbark or the mockernut and the\r\nshagbark should be thin shelled, is more than I can imagine. We have two\r\noccurrences however which are significant. On the list of Japan walnuts\r\ntwo hybrids of the Persian and Japan walnut, Cording and Siebosian are\r\nnoted. I have never tested a Persian walnut where the cracking pressure\r\nruns much over 40kg and it is rather unusual for a Japan walnut to run\r\nmuch over 200kg, yet Cording is 419kg, a strength of shell greater than\r\nthat of any other nut sent into the contest this year and which is only\r\nfound among black walnuts and shellbark hickories. Siebosian is not very\r\nmuch less. If two comparatively thin shelled nuts will produce an\r\noffspring with a shell so much thicker than either parent, it does not\r\nseem more impossible for two thick shelled nuts to produce thin shelled\r\noffsprings.",
