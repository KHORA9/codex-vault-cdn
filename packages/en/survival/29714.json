INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last three hundred years there have been many questions of\r\ngeneral interest before the American people. It is doubtful, however, if\r\nthere is another problem, which is as warmly debated to-day as ever and\r\nwhose solution is yet so uncertain, as that of the Negro. In the second\r\ndecade of the seventeenth century protests were being filed against\r\nblack slavery, but the system was continued for nearly 250 years. The\r\ndiscussion grew more and more bitter, and to participation in it\r\nignorance, then as now, was no bar. The North had less and less direct\r\ncontact with the Negro. The religious hostility to human bondage was\r\nstrengthened by the steadily increasing difference in economic\r\ndevelopment which resulted in the creation of sectional prejudices and\r\njealousies. The North held the negro to be greatly wronged, and accounts\r\nof his pitiable condition and of the many individual cases of ill\r\ntreatment fanned the flames of wrath. The reports of travelers, however,\r\nhad little influence compared with the religious sentiments which felt\r\noutraged by the existence of bond servitude in the land. Through all the\r\nyears there was little attempt to scientifically study the character of\r\nthe problem or the nature of the subject. A mistaken economic sentiment\r\nin the South and a strong moral sentiment at the North rendered such\r\nstudies unnecessary, if not impossible. The South, perceiving the\r\nbenefits of slavery, was blind to its fundamental weaknesses, and the\r\nNorth, unacquainted with Negro character, held to the natural equality\r\nof all men. Thus slavery itself became a barrier to the getting of an\r\nadequate knowledge of the needs of the slave. The feeling grew that if\r\nthe shackles of slavery were broken, the Negro would at once be as other\r\nmen. The economic differences finally led to the war. It is not to be\r\nforgotten that slavery itself was not the cause of the war, nor was\r\nthere any thought on the part of the Union leaders to make the blacks\r\ncitizens. That this was done later was a glowing tribute to their\r\nignorance of the real demands of the situation. The Republican party of\r\nto-day shows no indication of repeating this mistake in the newly\r\nacquired islands. I would not be understood as opposing suffrage of the\r\nblacks, but any thoughtful observer must agree that as a race they were\r\nnot prepared for popular government at the time of their liberation. The\r\nfolly of the measures adopted none can fail to see who will read the\r\nhistory of South Carolina or Mississippi during what is called\r\n\"Reconstruction.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the war, new sources of information regarding the\r\nNegro were afforded the North. The leaders of the carpet-bag regime,\r\nplaying political games, circulated glowing reports of the progress of\r\nthe ex-slaves. A second class of persons, the teachers, went South, and\r\nback came rose-colored accounts. It might seem that the teacher could\r\nbest judge of the capacity of a people. The trouble is that in the\r\nschools they saw the best specimens of the race, at the impressionable\r\nperiod of their lives, and under abnormal conditions. There is in the\r\nschool an atmosphere about the child which stimulates his desire to\r\nadvance, but a relapse often comes when ordinary home conditions are\r\nrenewed. Moreover, it is well known that the children of all primitive\r\nraces are very quick and apt up to a certain period in their lives,\r\nexcelling often children of civilized peoples, but that this disappears\r\nwhen maturity is reached. Hence, the average teacher, not coming in\r\nclose contact with the mass of the people under normal surroundings,\r\ngives, although sincerely, a very misleading picture of actual\r\nconditions. A third class of informants were the tourists, and their\r\nability to get at the heart of the situation is obvious. There remain to\r\nbe mentioned the Negro teachers and school entrepreneurs. Naturally\r\nthese have presented such facts as they thought would serve to open the\r\npurses of their hearers. Some have been honest, many more\r\nunintentionally dishonest, and others deliberately deceitful. The\r\nrelative size of these classes it is unnecessary to attempt to\r\nascertain. They have talked and sung their way into the hearts of the\r\nhearers as does the pitiful beggar on the street. The donor sees that\r\nevidently something is needed, and gives with little, if any, careful\r\ninvestigation as to the real needs of the case. The result of it all has\r\nbeen that the testimony of those who knew far more than was possible for\r\nany outsider, the southern whites, has gone unheeded, not to say that it\r\nhas been spurned as hostile and valueless. The blame, of course, is not\r\nalways on one side, and as will be shown later, there are many southern\r\nwhites who have as little to do with the Negro, and consequently know as\r\nlittle about him, as the average New Yorker. This situation has been\r\nmost unfortunate for all concerned. It should not be forgotten that the\r\nquestion of the progress of the Negro has far more direct meaning for\r\nthe southerner, and that he is far more deeply interested in it than is\r\nhis northern brother, the popular impression to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding. It is unnecessary to seek explanations, but it is a\r\npleasure to recognize that there are many indications that a better day\r\nis coming, and indications now point to a hearty co-operation in\r\neducational efforts. There are many reasons for the change, and perhaps\r\nthe greatest of these is summed up in \"Industrial Training.\"\r\n\r\nThe North is slowly learning that the Negro is not a dark-skinned\r\nYankee, and that thousands of generations in Africa have produced a\r\nbeing very different from him whose ancestors lived an equal time in\r\nEurope. In a word, we now see that slavery does not account for all the\r\ndifferences between the blacks and whites, and that their origins lie\r\nfarther back. Our acquaintance with the ancestors of the Negro is\r\nmeager. We do not even know how many of the numerous African tribes are\r\nrepresented in our midst. A good deal of Semitic blood had already been\r\ninfused into the more northern tribes. What influence did this have and\r\nhow many descendants of these tribes are there in America? Tribal\r\ndistinctions have been hopelessly lost in this country, and the blending\r\nhas gone on so continuously that perhaps there would be little practical\r\nbenefit if the stocks could be determined to-day. It is, however, a\r\ncurious commentary on the turn discussions of the question have taken,\r\nthat not until 1902 did any one find it advisable to publish a\r\ncomprehensive study of the African environment and to trace its\r\ninfluence on subsequent development. Yet this is one of the fundamental\r\npreliminaries to any real knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn close connection with the preceding is the question of the mulatto.\r\nBesides the blending of African stocks there has been a good deal of\r\nintermixture of white blood. We do not even know how many full blooded\r\nAfricans there are in America, nor does the last census seek to\r\nascertain. Mulattoes have almost entirely been the offspring of white\r\nfathers and black mothers, and probably most of the fathers have been\r\nboys and young men. Without attempting a discussion of this subject,\r\nwhose results ethnologists cannot yet tell, it is certain that a half\r\nbreed is not a full blood, a mulatto is not a Negro, in spite of the\r\nsocial classification to the contrary. The general belief is that the\r\nmulatto is superior, either for good or bad, to the pure Negro. The\r\nvisitor to the South cannot fail to be struck with the fact that with\r\nrare exceptions the colored men in places of responsibility, in\r\neducation or in business, are evidently not pure negroes. Even in\r\nslavery times, the mulattoes were preferred for certain positions, such\r\nas overseers, the blacks as field hands. Attention is called to this\r\nmerely to show our ignorance of an important point. Some may claim that\r\nit is a matter of no consequence. This I cannot admit. To me it seems of\r\nsome significance to know whether mulattoes (and other crosses) form\r\nmore than their relative percentage of the graduates of the higher\r\nschools; whether they are succeeding in business better than the blacks;\r\nwhether town life is proving particularly attractive to them; whether\r\nthey have greater or less moral and physical stamina, than the blacks.\r\nThe lack of definite knowledge should at least stop the prevalent\r\npractice of taking the progress of a band of mulattoes and attempting to\r\nestimate that of the Negroes thereby. It may be that some day the\r\nmulatto will entirely supplant the black, but there is no immediate\r\nprobability of this. Until we know the facts, our prophecies are but\r\nwild guesses. It should be remembered that a crossing of white and black\r\nmay show itself in the yellow negro or the changed head and features,\r\neither, or both, as the case may be. A dark skin is, therefore, no sure\r\nindication of purity and blood.[1]\r\n\r\nIt is often taken for granted that the Negro has practically equal\r\nopportunities in the various parts of the South, and that a fairly\r\nuniform rate of progress may be expected. This assumption rests on an\r\nignorance of the geographical location of the mass of blacks. It will be\r\nshown that they are living in several distinct agricultural zones in\r\nwhich success must be sought according to local possibilities.\r\nDevelopment always depends upon the environment, and we should expect,\r\ntherefore, unequal progress for the Negroes. Even the highest fruits of\r\ncivilization fail if the bases of life are suddenly changed. The\r\nCongregational Church has not flourished among the Negroes as have some\r\nother denominations, in spite of its great activity in educational work.\r\nThe American mode of government is being greatly modified to make it fit\r\nconditions in Porto Rico. The manufacturers of Pennsylvania and the\r\nfarmers of Iowa do not agree as to the articles on which duties should\r\nbe levied, and it is a question if the two have the same interpretation\r\nof the principle of protection. Different environments produce different\r\ntypes. So it will be in the case of the Negro. If we are to understand\r\nthe conditions on which his progress depends, we must pay some attention\r\nto economic geography. That this will result in a recognition of the\r\nneed for shaping plans and methods according to local needs is obvious.\r\nThe present thesis does not pretend to be a completed study, much less\r\nan attempt to solve the Negro problem. It is written in the hope of\r\ncalling attention to some of the results of this geographic location as\r\nillustrated in the situation of the Negro farmer in various parts of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThe attempt is made to describe the situation of the average man. It is\r\nfully recognized that there are numbers of exceptions among the Negroes\r\nas well as among the white school teachers, referred to above. That\r\nthere is much in the present situation, both of encouragement and\r\ndiscouragement, is patent. Unfortunately, most of us shut our eyes to\r\none or the other set of facts and are wildly optimistic or pessimistic,\r\naccordingly. That there may be no misunderstanding of my position, let\r\nme say that I agree with the late Dr. J. L. M. Curry in stating that: \"I\r\nhave very little respect for the intelligence or the patriotism of the\r\nman who doubts the capacity of the negro for improvement or usefulness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Appalachian system, running parallel to the Atlantic coast,\r\nand ending in northern Alabama, forms the geological axis of the\r\nsouthern states. Bordering the mountains proper is a broad belt of hills\r\nknown as the Piedmont or Metamorphic region, marked by granite and other\r\ncrystalline rocks, and having an elevation decreasing from 1,000 to 500\r\nfeet. The soil varies according to the underlying rocks, but is thin and\r\nwashes badly, if carelessly tilled. The oaks, hickories and other\r\nhardwoods, form the forests. In Virginia this section meets the lower\r\nand flatter country known as Tide-Water Virginia. In the southern part\r\nof this state we come to the Pine Hills, which follow the Piedmont and\r\nstretch, interrupted only by the alluvial lands of the Mississippi, to\r\ncentral Texas. The Pine Hills seldom touch the Piedmont directly, but\r\nare separated by a narrow belt of Sand Hills, which run from North\r\nCarolina to Alabama, then swing northward around the coal measures and\r\nspread out in Tennessee and Kentucky. This region, in general of poor\r\nsoils, marks the falls of the rivers and the head of navigation. How\r\nimportant this is may easily be seen by noticing the location of the\r\ncities in Georgia, for instance, and remembering that the country was\r\nsettled before the day of railroads. In Alabama the Black Prairie is\r\ninterposed between the Pine Hills and the Sand Hills, and this prairie\r\nswings northward into Mississippi. The Pine Hills give way to the more\r\nlevel Pine Flats, which slope with a gradient of a few feet a mile to\r\nthe ocean or the gulf, which usually has a narrow alluvial border. Going\r\nwest from Alabama we cross the oak and hickory lands of Central\r\nMississippi, which are separated from the alluvial district by the cane\r\nhills and yellow loam table lands. Beyond the bottom lands of the\r\nMississippi (and Red river) we come to the oak lands of Missouri,\r\nArkansas and Texas which stretch to the black prairies of Texas, which,\r\nbordering the red lands of Arkansas, run southwest finally, merging in\r\nthe coast prairies near Austin. In the northern part of Arkansas we come\r\nto the foothills of the Ozarks. These different regions are shown by the\r\ndotted lines on the population maps.\r\n\r\nThe soils of these various regions having never been subjected to a\r\nglacial epoch, are very diverse, and it would be a thankless task to\r\nattempt any detailed classification on the basis of fertility. The soils\r\nof the Atlantic side being largely from the crystalline rocks and\r\ncontaining therefore much silica, are reputed less fertile than the\r\ngulf soils. The alluvial lands of the Mississippi and other rivers are\r\nbeyond question the richest of all. Shaler says: \"The delta districts of\r\nthe Mississippi and its tributaries and similar alluvial lands which\r\noccupy broad fields near the lower portion of other streams flowing into\r\nthe gulf have proved the most enduringly fertile areas of the country.\"\r\nNext to these probably stand the black prairies. In all states there is\r\nmore or less alluvial land along the streams, and this soil is always\r\nthe best. It is the first land brought into cultivation when the country\r\nis settled, and remains most constantly in use. Each district has its\r\nown advantages and its own difficulties. In the metamorphic regions, the\r\ntrouble comes in the attempt to keep the soil on the hills, while in the\r\nflat lands the problem is to get proper drainage. In the present\r\nsituation of the Negro farmer the adaptability of the soil to cotton is\r\nthe chief consideration.\r\n\r\nThe first slaves were landed at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. The\r\nimportation was continued in spite of many protests, and the practice\r\nsoon came into favor. Almost without interruption, in spite of various\r\nprohibitions, the slave traffic lasted right up to the very outbreak of\r\nthe war, most of the later cargoes being landed along the gulf coast.\r\nSlavery proved profitable at the South; not so at the North, where it\r\nwas soon abandoned. It was by no means, however, equally profitable in\r\nall parts of the South, and as time went on this fact became more\r\nnoticeable. Thus at the outbreak of the war, Kentucky and Virginia were\r\nlargely employed in selling slaves to the large plantations further\r\nsouth. Few new slaves had been imported into Virginia in the last one\r\nhundred years. The center of slavery thus moved southwest because of\r\nchanging economic conditions, not because of any inherent opposition to\r\nthe system. This gradual weeding out of the slaves in Virginia may very\r\npossibly account for the general esteem in which Virginia negroes have\r\nbeen held. To indicate the character of those sold South, Bracket[2]\r\ngives a quotation from a Baltimore paper of 1851 which advertised some\r\ngood Negroes to be \"exchanged for servants suitable for the South with\r\nbad characters.\"\r\n\r\nTo trace the development of the slave-holding districts is not germain\r\nto the present study, interesting as it is in itself. It may be worth\r\nwhile to trace the progress in one state. In Georgia, in 1800, the\r\nblacks outnumbered the whites in the seacoast counties, excepting\r\nCamden, and were also in the majority in Richmond. In 1830 they also\r\noutnumbered the whites along the Savannah river and were reaching\r\nwestward as far as Jones county. In 1850, besides the coast and the\r\nriver, they were in a majority in a narrow belt crossing the state from\r\nLincoln to Harris counties. By 1860 they had swung southward in the\r\nwestern part of the state and were in possession of most of the\r\ncounties south of Troup, while the map of 1900 shows that they have\r\nadded to this territory. In other parts of the state they have never\r\nbeen greatly in evidence. The influence of the rivers is again evident\r\nwhen we notice that they moved up to the head of navigation, then swung\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\nAs slavery developed, it was accompanied by a great extension of cotton\r\ngrowing, or, perhaps, it were truer to say that the gradual rise of\r\ncotton planting made possible the increased use of slaves. The center of\r\nthe cotton industry had reached the middle of Alabama by 1850, was near\r\nJackson, Mississippi, in 1860, and has since moved slowly westward. The\r\nmost prosperous district of the South in 1860 was probably the alluvial\r\nlands of the Mississippi. This gives us the key to the westward trend of\r\nslavery. Let it be remembered, too, that the system of slavery demands\r\nan abundance of new lands to take the place of those worn out by the\r\nshort-sighted cultivation adopted. Thus in the South little attention\r\nwas paid to rotation of crops or to fertilizers. As long as the new land\r\nwas abundant, it was not considered, and probably was not profitable to\r\nkeep up the old. The result was that \"the wild and reckless system of\r\nextensive cultivation practiced prior to the war had impoverished the\r\nland of every cotton-producing state east of the Mississippi river.\" As\r\ncotton became less and less profitable in the east the opening up of the\r\nnewer and richer lands in the west put the eastern planter in a more and\r\nmore precarious situation. Had cotton fallen to anything like its\r\npresent price in the years immediately preceding the war, his lot would\r\nhave been far worse.\r\n\r\nAnother influence should be noted. Slavery tended to drive out of a\r\ncommunity those who opposed the system, and also the poor whites,\r\nnon-slave holders. The planters sought to buy out or expel this latter\r\nclass, because of the temptation they were under to incite the slaves to\r\nsteal corn and cotton and sell it to them at a low price. There was also\r\ntrouble in many other ways. There was thus a tendency to separate the\r\nmass of the blacks from the majority of the whites. That this\r\nsegregation actually arose a map of the proportionate populations for\r\nAlabama in 1860 shows. It may be claimed that there were other reasons\r\nfor this separation, such as climatic conditions, etc. This may be\r\npartially true, but it evidently cannot be the principal reason, for we\r\nfind the whites in the majority in many of the lowest and theoretically\r\nmost unhealthful regions, as in the pine flats. This is the situation\r\nto-day also.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the rivers in determining the settlement of the country\r\nhas been mentioned. Nowhere was this more the case than in the alluvial\r\nlands of the Mississippi, the so-called \"Delta.\" This country was low\r\nand flat, subject to overflows of the river. The early settlements were\r\ndirectly on the banks of the navigable streams, because this only was\r\naccessible, and because the land immediately bordering the streams is\r\nhigher than the back land. Levees were at once started to control the\r\nrivers, but not until the railroads penetrated the country in 1884 was\r\nthere any development of the back land. Even to-day most of this is\r\nstill wild.\r\n\r\nThe war brought numerous changes, but it is only in place here to\r\nconsider those affecting the location of the people. The mobility of\r\nlabor is one of the great changes. Instead of a fixed labor force we now\r\nhave to deal with a body relatively free to go and come. The immediate\r\nresult is that a stream of emigration sets in from the border states to\r\nthe cities of the North, where there was great opportunity for servants\r\nand all sorts of casual labor. The following table shows the number of\r\nnegroes in various northern cities in 1860 and also in 1900:\r\n\r\n                   1860.         1900.\r\n  Washington     10,983         86,702\r\n  Baltimore      27,898         79,258\r\n  Philadelphia   22,185         62,613\r\n  New York       16,785         60,666\r\n  St. Louis       3,297         35,516\r\n  Chicago           955         30,150\r\n\r\n\r\nCoincident with the movement to the more distant towns came a\r\ndevelopment of southern cities. City life has been very attractive to\r\nNegroes here also, as the following table indicates:\r\n\r\n                   1860.         1900.\r\n  New Orleans    24,074         77,714\r\n  Atlanta         1,939         35,727\r\n  Richmond       14,275         32,230\r\n  Charleston     17,146         31,522\r\n  Savannah        8,417         28,090\r\n  Montgomery      4,502         17,229\r\n  Birmingham        ...         16,575\r\n\r\n\r\nOther cities show the same gains. As a rule, the negro has been the\r\ncommon laborer in the cities and in the trades does not seem to hold the\r\nsame relative position he had in 1860. In recent years there has been\r\nquite a development of small tradesmen among them.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the two tables shows that Washington and Baltimore have\r\nmore Negroes than New Orleans; that St. Louis has more than Atlanta and\r\nRichmond, while New York and Philadelphia contain double the number of\r\nSavannah and Charleston. This emigration to the North has had great\r\neffect upon many districts of the South. It seems also to be certain\r\nthat the Negroes have not maintained themselves in the northern cities,\r\nand that the population has been kept up by constant immigration. What\r\nthis has meant we may see when we find that in 1860 the Negroes were in\r\nthe majority in five counties in Maryland, in two in 1900; in 43 in\r\nVirginia in 1860, in 35 in 1900; in North Carolina in 19 in 1860, in 15\r\nin 1900.\r\n\r\nThe map on page 13 shows the movement of the Negro population in\r\nVirginia between 1890 and 1900. The shaded counties, 60 in number,\r\nhave lost in actual population (Negro). The total actual decrease in\r\nthese counties was over 27,000. Even in the towns there has been a loss,\r\nfor in 1890 the twelve towns of over 2,500 population contained 32,692\r\nNegroes. In 1900 only 29,575. The only section in which there has been a\r\nheavy increase is the seacoast from Norfolk and Newport News to the\r\nnorth and including Richmond. A city like Roanoke also makes its\r\npresence felt. When we remember that the Negroes in Virginia number over\r\n600,000, and that the total increase in the decade was only 25,000, a\r\nheavy emigration becomes clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VIRGINIA, 1890-1900. MOVEMENT OF NEGRO POPULATION.\r\n\r\nShaded Counties show decrease. White Counties indicate increase. Figures\r\nshow extent of change.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a common laborer also the negro has borne his part in the development\r\nof the economical resources of the South. He has built the railroads and\r\nlevees; has hewn lumber in the forests; has dug phosphate rock on the\r\ncoast and coal in the interior. Wherever there has been a development of\r\nlabor industry calling for unskilled labor he has found a place. All\r\nthese have combined to turn him from the farm, his original American\r\nhome. The changing agricultural conditions which have had a similar\r\ninfluence will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly reviewed the influences which have had part in\r\ndetermining his general habitat we are ready to examine more closely his\r\npresent location. The maps of the Negro population will show this for\r\nthe different states. A word regarding these maps. They are drawn on the\r\nsame scale, and the shading represents the same things for the different\r\nstates. The density map should always be compared with the proportionate\r\nmap to get a correct view of the actual situation. If this is not done,\r\nconfused ideas will result. On the density maps if a county has a much\r\nheavier shading than surrounding ones, a city is probably the\r\nexplanation. The reverse may be true on the proportionate maps where the\r\nlighter shading may indicate the presence of numbers of whites in some\r\ncity, as in Montgomery County, Alabama, or Charleston County, South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nBeginning with Virginia, we find almost no Negroes in the western\r\nmountain districts, but their numbers increase as we approach the coast\r\nand their center is in the southeast. The heavy district in North\r\nCarolina adjoins that in Virginia, diminishing in the southern part of\r\nthe state. Entering South Carolina we discover a much heavier\r\npopulation, both actually and relatively. Geographical foundations\r\nunfortunately (for our purpose) do not follow county lines. It is very\r\nlikely, however, that could we get at the actual location of the people,\r\nwe should find that they had their influence. Evidently the Sand 'Hills\r\nhave some significance, for the density map shows a lighter negro\r\npopulation. So does the Pine Flats district, although in this state the\r\nNegroes are in the majority in the region, having been long settled in\r\nthe race districts. In no other state do the blacks outnumber the whites\r\nin the Pine Flats. In Georgia the northern part is in possession of the\r\nwhites, as are the Pine Flats. The Negroes hold the center and the\r\ncoast. In Florida the Negroes are in the Pine Hills. In Alabama they\r\ncenter in the Pine Hills and Black Prairie. In Mississippi, Arkansas and\r\nLouisiana they are in the alluvial regions, and in Texas they find their\r\nheaviest seat near Houston. Outside of the city counties we do not find\r\na population of over 30 negroes to the square mile until South Carolina\r\nis reached, and the heaviest settlement is in the black prairie of\r\nAlabama and the alluvial region of Mississippi, and part of Louisiana.\r\nIn Tennessee they are found along the river and in the red lands of the\r\ncenter, while in Kentucky they are chiefly located in the Limestone\r\ndistrict. Summarizing their location, we may say that they start in the\r\neast-central portion of Virginia and follow the line of the Pine Hills\r\nto Alabama, only slightly encroaching upon the Metamorphic district, and\r\nexcept in South Carolina, on the pine flats. They occupy the black\r\nprairie of Alabama and Mississippi, and the lands of the river states\r\nwith a smaller population in the Oak Hills of Texas, the red lands of\r\nTennessee and some of the limestone district of Kentucky. It is worth\r\nwhile to examine one state more in detail and Alabama has been selected\r\nas being typical. The Negro proportion in the state in 1860 was 45.4 per\r\ncent, and in 1900 was 45.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nAn examination of a proportionate map for 1860 would show that the slave\r\nowners found two parts of the state favorable to them. The first is\r\nalong the Tennessee river in the North, and the second, the black\r\nprairie of the center. Of these the latter was by far the seat of the\r\nheavier population. It has already been suggested that this was probably\r\nthe best land in the slave states, save the alluvial bottoms. Both\r\ndistricts were accessible by water. The Tombigbee and Alabama rivers\r\nreached all parts of the prairie, the Tennessee forming the natural\r\noutlet of the North. By referring now to the map of 1900, it is evident\r\nthat some changes have taken place. The prairie country, the \"Black\r\nBelt,\" is still in the possession of the Negroes, and their percentage\r\nis larger, having increased from 71 to 80. The population per square\r\nmile is also heavier. Dallas, Sumter and Lowndes counties had a Negro\r\npopulation of 23.6 per square mile in 1860, and 39.2 in 1900. In the\r\nnorthern district an opposite condition exists. In 1860 the region\r\nembracing the counties of Lauderdale, Limestone, Franklin, Colbert,\r\nLawrence and Morgan had a colored population forming 44.5 per cent of\r\nthe total. In 1900 the Negroes were but 33 per cent of the total. The\r\ndistrict contains some 4,609 square miles, and had in 1860 a Negro\r\npopulation of 11 to the square mile; in 1900, 13.5. Of this increase of\r\n2.5 per mile, about one-half is found to be in the four towns of the\r\ndistrict whose population is over 2,500 each. The smaller villages would\r\nprobably account for most of the balance, so it seems safe to say that\r\nthe farming population has scarcely increased in the last forty years.\r\nMeantime the whites in the district have increased from 12 per square\r\nmile to 25.4. The census shows that between 1890 and 1900 six counties\r\nof North Alabama lost in the actual Negro population, and two others\r\nwere stationary, while in the black belt the whites decreased in four\r\ncounties and were stationary in two. It will be seen that the Negroes\r\nhave gained in Jefferson (Birmingham) and Talladega counties. The\r\nopportunities for unskilled labor account largely for this, and\r\nTalladega is also a good cotton county. In Winston and Cullman counties\r\nthere are practically no Negroes, the census showing but 28 in the two.\r\nIn 1860 they formed 3 per cent of the total in Winston and 6 percent in\r\nBlount, which at that time included Cullman. The explanation of their\r\ndisappearance is found in the fact that since the war these counties\r\nhave been settled by Germans from about Cincinnati, and the Negroes have\r\nfound it convenient to move. Roughly speaking, the poor land of the Sand\r\nHills separates the white farmers from the colored. From 1890 to 1900\r\nthe Negroes lost relatively in the Metamorphic and Sand Hills, were\r\nabout stationary in the Prairie, from which they have overflowed and\r\ngained in the Oak Hills, and more heavily in the Pine Hills. This\r\nstatement is based on an examination of five or six counties, lying\r\nalmost wholly within each of the districts, and which, so far as known,\r\nwere not affected by the development of any special industry. The period\r\nis too short to do more than indicate that the separation of the two\r\nraces seems to be still going on. A similar separation exists in\r\nMississippi, where the Negroes hold the Black Prairie and the Delta, the\r\nwhites the hill country of the center.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there is a segregation of the whites and blacks, and\r\nthat there are forces which tend to perpetuate and increase this. It is\r\ninteresting to note that whereas in slavery the cabins were grouped in\r\nthe \"quarters,\" in close proximity to the \"big house\" of the master,\r\nthey are now scattered about the plantation so that even here there is\r\nless contact. In the cities this separation is evident the blacks occupy\r\ndefinite districts, while the social separation is complete. It seems\r\nthat in all matters outside of business relations the whites have less\r\nand less to do with the blacks. If this division is to continue, we may\r\nwell ask what is its significance for the future.\r\n\r\nThis geographical segregation evidently had causes which were largely\r\neconomic. Probably the most potent factor to-day in perpetuating it is\r\nsocial, i. e., race antagonism. The whites do not like to settle in a\r\nregion where they are to compete with the Negro on the farms as ordinary\r\nfield hands. Moreover, the Negroes retain their old-time scorn of such\r\nwhites and despise them. The result is friction. Mr. A. H. Stone cites a\r\ncase in point. He is speaking of a Negro serving a sentence for\r\nattempted rape: \"I was anxious to know how, if at all, he accounted for\r\nhis crime, but he was reluctant to discuss it. Finally he said to me:\r\n'You don't understand--things over here are so different. I hired to an\r\nold man over there by the year. He had only about forty acres of land,\r\nand he and his old folks did all their own work--cooking, washing and\r\neverything. I was the only outside hand he had. His daughter worked\r\nright alongside of me in the field every day for three or four months.\r\nFinally, one day, when no one else was round, hell got into me, and I\r\ntried to rape her. But you folks over there can't understand--things are\r\nso different. Over here a nigger is a nigger, and a white man is a white\r\nman, and it's the same with the women.' ... Her only crime was a poverty\r\nwhich compelled her to do work which, in the estimation of the Negro,\r\nwas reserved as the natural portion of his own race, and the doing of\r\nwhich destroyed the relation which otherwise constituted a barrier to\r\nhis brutality.\"[3]\r\n\r\nMr. Stone has touched upon one of the most delicate questions in the\r\nrelationship of the races. It would be out of place to discuss it here,\r\nbut attention must be called to the fact that there is the least of such\r\ntrouble in the districts where the Negro forms the largest percentage of\r\nthe population. I would not be so foolish as to say that assaults upon\r\nwhite women _may_ not take place anywhere, but as a matter of fact they\r\nseem to occur chiefly in those regions where white and black meet as\r\ncompetitors for ordinary labor. Beaufort County, South Carolina, has a\r\nblack population forming about 90 per cent of the total, yet I was told\r\nlast summer that but one case of rape had been known in the county, and\r\nthat took place on the back edge of the county where there are fewest\r\nNegroes, and was committed by a non-resident black upon a non-resident\r\nwhite. Certain it is that in this county, which includes many islands,\r\nalmost wholly inhabited by blacks, the white women have no fear of such\r\nassaults. This is also the case in the Mississippi Delta. Mr. Stone\r\nsays: \"Yet here we hear nothing about an ignorant mass of Negroes\r\ndragging the white man down; we hear of no black incubus; we have few\r\nmidnight assassinations and fewer lynchings. The violation by a Negro of\r\nthe person of a white woman is with us an unknown crime; nowhere is the\r\nline marking the social separation of the races more rigidly drawn,\r\nnowhere are the relations between the races more kindly. With us race\r\nriots are unknown, and we have but one Negro problem--though that\r\nconstantly confronts us--how to secure more Negroes.\" Evidently when we\r\nhear reports of states of siege and rumors of race war, we are not to\r\nunderstand that this is the normal, typical condition of the entire\r\nSouth. If this is the real situation, it seems clear that the\r\ngeographical segregation plays no mean part in determining the relation\r\nof the two races. It is safe to say that there is a different feeling\r\nbetween the races in the districts where the white is known only as the\r\nleader and those in which he comes into competition with the black. What\r\nis the significance of this for the future?\r\n\r\nThe same condition exists in the cities, and of this Professor Dubois\r\nhas taken note: \"Savannah is an old city where the class of masters\r\namong the whites and of trained and confidential slaves among the\r\nNegroes formed an exceptionally large part of the population. The result\r\nhas been unusual good feeling between the races, and the entrance of\r\nNegroes into all walks of industrial life, with little or no\r\nopposition.\" \"Atlanta, on the other hand, is quite opposite in\r\ncharacter. Here the poor whites from North Georgia who neither owned\r\nslaves nor had any acquaintance with Negro character, have come into\r\ncontact and severe competition with the blacks. The result has been\r\nintense race feeling.\"[4] In one of the large towns of the Delta last\r\nsummer, a prosperous Negro merchant said to me, in discussing the\r\ncomparative opportunities of different sections: \"I would not be allowed\r\nto have a store on the main street in such a good location in many\r\nplaces.\" Yet, his store is patronized by whites; and this would be true\r\nin many towns in the black belt. Other evidences of the difference in\r\nfeeling towards the Negroes is afforded by the epithets of\r\n\"hill-billies\" and \"red-necks\" applied to the whites of the hill country\r\nby the lowland planters, and the retaliatory compliments\r\n\"yellow-bellies\" and \"nigger-lovers.\" Does this geographical segregation\r\nhelp to explain the strikingly diverse reports coming from various parts\r\nof the South regarding the Negro? Why does Dr. Paul Barringer, of\r\nVirginia, find that race antagonism is rapidly growing, while Mr. Stone\r\nof Mississippi, says that their problem is to get more Negroes?\r\n\r\nThe influence that this segregation has upon school facilities for both\r\nraces should not be overlooked. The separation of the two races in the\r\nschools is to be viewed as the settled policy of the South. Here, then,\r\nis a farming community in which there are only a few Negroes. What sort\r\nof a separate school will be maintained for their children? Probably\r\nthey are unable to support a good school, even should they so desire.\r\nThe opportunities of their children must necessarily be limited. Will\r\nthey make greater progress than children in the districts where the\r\nblacks are in large numbers and command good schools? If the situation\r\nbe reversed and there are a few whites in a black community, the whites\r\nwill be able to command excellent private schools for their children, if\r\nnecessary. At present among the males over 21, the greatest illiteracy\r\nis found in the black counties. This may be accounted for by the\r\npresence of the older generation, which had little chance in the\r\nschools, and by the fact that perhaps those moving away have been the\r\nmore progressive. It is a matter of regret that the census does not\r\npermit us to ascertain the illiteracy among the children from 10 to 21\r\nyears of age, to see if any difference was manifest. It would seem,\r\nhowever, that this segregation, coupled with race antagonism, is bound\r\nto affect the educational opportunities for the blacks. A problem which\r\nbecomes more serious as the states waken to the needs of the case and\r\nattempt to educate their children.\r\n\r\nYet again, this fact of habitat should lead us to be very chary of\r\nmaking local facts extend over the entire South and of making deductions\r\nfor the entire country based on observations in a few places. Neglect of\r\nthis precaution often leads to very erroneous and misleading conceptions\r\nof actual conditions. For instance, on page 419, Vol. VI, Census of\r\n1900, in discussing the fact that Negro receives nearly as much per acre\r\nfor his cotton as does the white, it is stated: \"Considering the fact\r\nthat he emerged from slavery only one-third of a century ago, and\r\nconsidering also his comparative lack of means for procuring the best\r\nland or for getting the best results from what he has, this near\r\napproach to the standard attained by the white man's experience for more\r\nthan a century denotes remarkable progress.\" This may or may not be\r\ntrue, but the reason and proof are open to question. It assumes that the\r\nland cultivated by the Negroes is of the same quality as that farmed by\r\nthe whites. This certainly is not true of Arkansas, of which it is\r\nstated that \"Arkansas shows a greater production per acre by colored\r\nfarmers for all three tenures.\" The three tenures are owners,\r\ncash-tenants, share-tenants. Mississippi agrees with Arkansas in showing\r\nhigher production for both classes of tenants. Are we to infer that the\r\nNegroes in Arkansas and Mississippi are better farmers than the whites,\r\nand that, therefore, their progress has infinitely surpassed his? By no\r\nmeans. The explanation is that in the two states mentioned the Negroes\r\ncultivate the rich bottom land while the white farmers are found in the\r\nhills. The alluvial land easily raises twice the cotton, and that of a\r\nbetter quality, commanding about a cent a pound more in the market.\r\nThere may possibly be similar conditions in other states; certainly in\r\nAlabama the black prairie tilled by the Negroes is esteemed better than\r\nthe other land. Since this was first written I have chanced upon the\r\nreport of the Geological Survey of Alabama for 1881 and 1882, in which\r\nMr. E. A. Smith sums up this same problem as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"(1) That where the blacks are in excess of the whites, there are\r\n     the originally most fertile lands of the state. The natural\r\n     advantages of the soils are, however, more than counterbalanced by\r\n     the bad system prevailing in such sections, viz.; large farms\r\n     rented out in patches to laborers who are too poor and too much in\r\n     debt to merchants to have any interest in keeping up the fertility\r\n     of the soil, or rather the ability to keep it up, with the natural\r\n     consequence of its rapid exhaustion, and a product per acre on\r\n     these, the best lands of the state, lower than that which is\r\n     realized from the very poorest.\r\n\r\n     \"(2) Where the two races are in nearly equal proportions, or where\r\n     the whites are in only a slight excess over the blacks, as is the\r\n     case in all sections where the soils are of average fertility,\r\n     there is found the system of small farms, worked generally by the\r\n     owners, a consequently better cultivation, a more general use of\r\n     commercial fertilizers, a correspondingly high product per acre\r\n     and a partial maintenance of the fertility of the soils.\r\n\r\n     \"(3) Where the whites are greatly in excess of the blacks (three to\r\n     one and above) the soils are almost certain to be far below the\r\n     average in fertility, and the product per acre is low from this\r\n     cause, notwithstanding the redeeming influences of a comparatively\r\n     rational system of cultivation.\r\n\r\n     \"(4) The exceptions to these general rules are nearly always due to\r\n     local causes which are not far to seek and which afford generally a\r\n     satisfactory explanation of the discrepancies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we are to base our reasoning on the table cited we might argue that\r\nland ownership is a bad thing for Negroes, for tenants of both classes\r\namong them produced more than did the owners. The white cash tenants\r\nalso produced more than white owners. In explaining this it is said:\r\n\"The fact that cash tenants pay a fixed money rental per acre causes\r\nthem to rent only such area as they can cultivate thoroughly, while many\r\nowners who are unable to rent their excess acreage to tenants attempt to\r\ncultivate it themselves, thus decreasing the efficiency of cultivation\r\nfor the entire farm.\" This may be true of the whites, but it is a lame\r\nexplanation for the blacks. Negro farmers who own more land than they\r\ncan cultivate appear to be better known at Washington than they are\r\nlocally. The trouble with the entire argument is that it assumes that\r\nthe Negro is an independent cultivator of cotton. This is not quite the\r\ncase. In all parts of the South the Negro, tenant or owner, usually\r\nreceives advances from white factors, and these spend a good part of\r\ntheir time riding about to see that the land is cultivated in order to\r\ninsure repayment of their loans. If their advice and suggestions are not\r\nfollowed, or if the crop is not cultivated, the supplies are shut off.\r\nOn many plantations even the portion of the land to be put in cotton is\r\nstipulated. The great bulk of the cotton crop is thus raised under the\r\nimmediate oversight of the white man. There is little call for any great\r\nskill on the part of the laborer. No wonder the crop of the Negro\r\napproximates that of the white man. It is to be further remembered that\r\ncotton raising has been the chief occupation of the Negro in America.\r\nThe Census gives another illustration of the unhappy effects of\r\nattempting to cover very diverse conditions in one statement in the map\r\nVol. VI, plate 3. From this one would be justified in believing that the\r\naverage farm under one management in the alluvial lands of Mississippi\r\nand Louisiana was small. As a matter of fact they are among the largest\r\nin the country. The map gives a very misleading conception and it\r\nresults wholly from attempting to combine divergent conditions.\r\n\r\nThe quotation from Mr. Smith touched upon another result of this\r\nsegregation. Where the whites are the farmers the farms are smaller and\r\nbetter cared for, more fertilizers are used, and better results are\r\nobtained. The big plantation system has caused the deterioration of\r\nnaturally fertile soils. Of course, there must come a day of reckoning\r\nwherever careless husbandry prevails.\r\n\r\nCity conditions are more or less uniform in all sections. The\r\ngeographical location of the farmer, however, is a matter of\r\nconsiderable importance not only as determining in large measure the\r\ncrop he must raise, but as limiting the advance he may be able to make\r\nunder given conditions. It is estimated that about 85 per cent of the\r\nmen (Negroes) and 44 per cent of the women in productive pursuits are\r\nfarmers. Their general location has been shown. For convenience we may\r\ndivide the territory into five districts: (1) Virginia and Kentucky,\r\nabove the limit of profitable cotton culture. (2) The Atlantic Sea\r\nCoast. (3) The Central belt running from Virginia to Central\r\nMississippi. This includes several different soils, but general\r\nconditions are fairly uniform. (4) The Alluvial Lands, which may be\r\nsubdivided into the cotton and cane districts. (5) Texas. These\r\ndifferent districts will be treated separately, except Texas, which is\r\nnot included.\r\n\r\nIn summing up this chapter it may be said that the location of the mass\r\nof the Negro farmers has been indicated, and also the fact that there is\r\na separation between the whites and the blacks which promises to have\r\nimportant bearing on future progress, while the various agricultural\r\ndistricts offer opportunities by no means uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. ECONOMIC HERITAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=IN PLOWING TIME.=\r\n\r\nPrevious to the appearance of the European, West Central Africa for\r\nuntold hundreds of years had been almost completely separated from the\r\noutside world. The climate is hot, humid, enervating. The Negro tribes\r\nliving in the great forests found little need for exertion to obtain the\r\nnecessities of savage life. The woods abounded in game, the rivers in\r\nfish. By cutting down a few trees and loosening the ground with\r\nsharpened sticks the plantains, a species of coarse banana, could be\r\nmade to yield many hundred fold. The greater part of the little\r\nagricultural work done fell on the women, for it was considered\r\ndegrading by the men. Handicrafts were almost unknown among many tribes\r\nand where they existed were of the simplest. Clothing was of little\r\nservice. Food preparations were naturally crude. Sanitary restrictions,\r\nseemingly so necessary in hot climates, were unheard of. The dead were\r\noften buried in the floors of the huts. Miss Kingsley says: \"All\r\ntravelers in West Africa find it necessary very soon to accustom\r\nthemselves to most noisome odors of many kinds and to all sorts of\r\nrevolting uncleanliness.\" Morality, as we use the term, did not exist.\r\nChastity was esteemed in the women only as a marketable commodity.\r\nMarriage was easily consummated and with even greater ease dissolved.\r\nSlavery, inter-tribal, was widespread, and the ravages of the slave\r\nhunter were known long before the arrival of the whites. Religion was a\r\nmass of grossest superstitions, with belief in the magical power of\r\nwitches and sorcerers who had power of life and death over their\r\nfellows. Might was right and the chiefs enforced obedience. It is not\r\nnecessary to go more into detail. In the words of a recent writer:\r\n\r\n     \"It is clear that any civilization which is based on the fertility\r\n     of the soil, and not on the energy of man, contains within itself\r\n     the seed of its own destruction. Where food is easily obtained,\r\n     where there is little need for clothing or houses, where, in brief,\r\n     unaided nature furnishes all man's necessities, those elements\r\n     which produce strength of character and vigor of mind are wanting,\r\n     and man becomes the slave of his surroundings. He acquires no\r\n     energy of disposition, he yields himself to superstition and\r\n     fatalism; the very conditions of life which produced his\r\n     civilization set the limit of its existence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the foregoing that there had been almost nothing in\r\nthe conditions of Africa to further habits of thrift and industry. The\r\nwarm climate made great provision for the future unnecessary, not to say\r\nimpossible, while social conditions did not favor accumulation of\r\nproperty. It is necessary to emphasize these African conditions, for\r\nthey have an important influence on future development. Under these\r\nconditions Negro character was formed, and that character was not like\r\nthat of the long-headed blonds of the North.\r\n\r\nThe transfer to America marked a sharp break with the past. One needs\r\nbut to stop to enumerate the changes to realize how great this break\r\nwas. A simple dialect is exchanged for a complex language. A religion\r\nwhose basic principle is love gradually supplants the fears and\r\nsuperstitions of heathenhood. The black passes from an enervating, humid\r\nclimate to one in which activity is pleasurable. From the isolation and\r\nself-satisfaction of savagery he emerges into close contact with one of\r\nthe most ambitious and progressive of peoples. Life at once becomes far\r\nmore secure and wrongs are revenged by the self-interest of the whites\r\nas well as by the feeble means of self-defense in possession of the\r\nblacks. That there were cruelties and mistreatment under slavery goes\r\nwithout saying, but the woes and sufferings under it were as nothing\r\ncompared to those of the life in the African forests. This fact is\r\nsometimes overlooked. With greater security of life came an emphasis,\r\nfrom without, to be sure, on better marital relations. In this respect\r\nslavery left much to be desired, but conditions on the whole were\r\nprobably in advance of those in Africa. Marriage began to be something\r\nmore than a purchase. Sanitation, not the word, but the underlying idea,\r\nwas taught by precept and example. There came also a dim notion of a new\r\nsphere for women. Faint perceptions ofttimes, but ideas never dreamed of\r\nin Africa. I would not defend slavery, but in this country its evil\r\nresults are the inheritance of the whites, not of the blacks, and the\r\nburden today of American slavery is upon white shoulders.\r\n\r\nMany of the changes have been mentioned, but the greatest is reserved\r\nfor the last. This is embraced in one word--WORK. For the first time the\r\nNegro was made to work, not casual work, but steady, constant labor.\r\nFrom the Negro's standpoint this is the redeeming feature of his slavery\r\nas perhaps it was for the Israelites in Egypt of old. Booker Washington\r\nhas written:[5] \"American slavery was a great curse to both races, and I\r\nwould be the last to apologize for it, but, in the providence of God, I\r\nbelieve that slavery laid the foundation for the solution of the problem\r\nthat is now before us in the South. During slavery the Negro was taught\r\nevery trade, every industry, that constitutes the foundation for making\r\na living.\"\r\n\r\nDr. H. B. Frissell has borne the same testimony:\r\n\r\n     \"The southern plantation was really a great trade school where\r\n     thousands received instruction in mechanic arts, in agriculture, in\r\n     cooking, sewing and other domestic occupations. Although it may be\r\n     said that all this instruction was given from selfish motives, yet\r\n     the fact remains that the slaves on many plantations had good\r\n     industrial training, and all honor is due to the conscientious men\r\n     and still more to the noble women of the South who in slavery times\r\n     helped to prepare the way for the better days that were to come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWork is the essential condition of human progress. Contrast the training\r\nof the Negro under enforced slavery with that of the Indian, although it\r\nshould not be thought that the characters were the same, for the life in\r\nAmerica had made the Indian one who would not submit to the yoke, and\r\nall attempts to enslave him came to naught. Dr. Frissell out of a long\r\nexperience says:\r\n\r\n     \"When the children of these two races are placed side by side, as\r\n     they are in the school rooms and workshops and on the farms at\r\n     Hampton, it is not difficult to perceive that the training which\r\n     the blacks had under slavery was far more valuable as a preparation\r\n     for civilized life than the freedom from training and service\r\n     enjoyed by the Indian on the Western reservations. For while\r\n     slavery taught the colored man to work, the reservation pauperized\r\n     the Indian with free rations; while slavery brought the black into\r\n     the closest relations with the white race and its ways of life, the\r\n     reservation shut the Indian away from his white brothers and gave\r\n     him little knowledge of their civilization, language or religion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coddled Indian, with all the vices of the white man open to him, has\r\nmade little, if any, progress, while the Negro, made to work, has held\r\nhis own in large measure at least.\r\n\r\nUnder slavery three general fields of service were open to the blacks.\r\nThe first comprised the domestic and body servants, with the\r\nseamstresses, etc., whose labors were in the house or in close personal\r\ncontact with masters and mistresses. This class was made up of the\r\nbrightest and quickest, mulattoes being preferred because of their\r\ngreater aptitude. These servants had almost as much to do with the\r\nwhites as did the other blacks and absorbed no small amount of learning.\r\nYet the results were not always satisfactory. A southern lady after\r\nvisiting for a time in New York said on leaving:[6]\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot tell you how much, after being in your house so long, I\r\n     dread to go home, and have to take care of our servants again. We\r\n     have a much smaller family of whites than you, but we have twelve\r\n     servants, and your two accomplish a great deal more and do their\r\n     work a great deal better than our twelve. You think your girls are\r\n     very stupid and that they give much trouble, but it is as nothing.\r\n     There is hardly one of our servants that can be trusted to do the\r\n     simplest work without being stood over. If I order a room to be\r\n     cleaned, or a fire to be made in a distant chamber, I can never be\r\n     sure I am obeyed unless I go there and see for myself.... And when\r\n     I reprimand them they only say that they don't mean to do anything\r\n     wrong, or they won't do it again, all the time laughing as though\r\n     it were a joke. They don't mind it at all. They are just as playful\r\n     and careless as any wilful child; and they never will do any work\r\n     if you don't compel them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second class comprised the mechanics, carpenters, blacksmiths,\r\nmasons and the like. These were also a picked lot. They were well\r\ntrained ofttimes and had a practical monopoly of their trades in many\r\nlocalities. In technical knowledge they naturally soon outstripped their\r\nmasters and became conscious of their superiority, as the following\r\ninstance related by President G. T. Winston shows:\r\n\r\n     \"I remember one day my father, who was a lawyer, offered some\r\n     suggestions to one of his slaves, a fairly good carpenter, who was\r\n     building us a barn. The old Negro heard him with ill-concealed\r\n     disgust, and replied: 'Look here, master, you'se a first-rate\r\n     lawyer, no doubt, but you don't know nothin' 'tall 'bout\r\n     carpentering. You better go back to your law books.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe training received by these artisans stood them in good stead after\r\nthe war, when, left to themselves, they were able to hold their ground\r\nby virtue of their ability to work alone.\r\n\r\nThe third class was made up of all that were left, and their work was in\r\nthe fields. The dullest, as well as those not needed elsewhere, were\r\nincluded. Some few became overseers, but the majority worked on the\r\nfarms. As a rule little work was required of children under 12, and when\r\nthey began their tasks were about of the adult's. Thence they passed to\r\n\"half,\" \"three-quarter\" and \"full\" hands. Olmsted said:[7]\r\n\r\n     \"Until the Negro is big enough for his labor to be plainly\r\n     profitable to his master he has no training to application or\r\n     method, but only to idleness and carelessness. Before children\r\n     arrive at a working age they hardly come under the notice of their\r\n     owner.... The only whipping of slaves I have seen in Virginia has\r\n     been of these wild, lazy children, as they are being broke in to\r\n     work. They cannot be depended upon a minute out of sight. You will\r\n     see how difficult it would be if it were attempted to eradicate the\r\n     indolent, careless, incogitant habits so formed in youth. But it is\r\n     not systematically attempted, and the influences that continue to\r\n     act upon a slave in the same direction, cultivating every quality\r\n     at variance with industry, precision, forethought and providence,\r\n     are innumerable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many places the field hands were given set tasks to do each day, and\r\nthey were then allowed to take their own time and stop when the task was\r\ncompleted. In Georgia and South Carolina the following is cited by\r\nOlmsted as tasks for a day:[7]\r\n\r\n     \"In making drains in light clean meadow land each man or woman of\r\n     the full hands is required to dig one thousand cubic feet; in swamp\r\n     land that is being prepared for rice culture, where there are not\r\n     many stumps, the task for a ditcher is five hundred feet; while in\r\n     a very strong cypress swamp, only two hundred feet is required; in\r\n     hoeing rice, a certain number of rows equal to one-half or\r\n     two-thirds of an acre, according to the condition of the land; in\r\n     sowing rice (strewing in drills), two acres; in reaping rice (if it\r\n     stands well), three-quarters of an acre, or, sometimes a gang will\r\n     be required to reap, tie in sheaves, and carry to the stack yard\r\n     the produce of a certain area commonly equal to one-fourth the\r\n     number of acres that there are hands working together; hoeing\r\n     cotton, corn or potatoes, one-half to one acre; threshing, five to\r\n     six hundred sheaves. In plowing rice land (light, clean, mellow\r\n     soil), with a yoke of oxen, one acre a day, including the ground\r\n     lost in and near the drains, the oxen being changed at noon. A\r\n     cooper also, for instance, is required to make barrels at the rate\r\n     of eighteen a week; drawing staves, 500 a day; hoop-poles, 120;\r\n     squaring timber, 100 feet; laying worm fence, 50 panels per day;\r\n     post and rail fence, posts set two and a half to three feet deep,\r\n     nine feet apart, nine or ten panels per hand. In getting fuel from\r\n     the woods (pine to be cut and split), one cord is the task for a\r\n     day. In 'mauling rails,' the taskman selecting the trees (pine)\r\n     that he judges will split easiest, 100 a day, ends not sharpened.\r\n\r\n     \"In allotting the tasks the drivers are expected to put the weaker\r\n     hands where, if there is any choice in the appearance of the\r\n     ground, as where certain rows in hoeing corn would be less weedy\r\n     than others, they will be favored.\r\n\r\n     \"These tasks would certainly not be considered excessively hard by\r\n     a northern laborer, and, in point of fact, the more industrious and\r\n     active hands finish them often by two o'clock. I saw one or two\r\n     leaving the field soon after one o'clock, several about two, and\r\n     between three and four I met a dozen women and several men coming\r\n     to their cabins, having finished their day's work.... If, after a\r\n     hard day's labor he (the driver) sees that the gang has been\r\n     overtasked, owing to a miscalculation of the difficulty of the\r\n     work, he may excuse the completion of the tasks, but he is not\r\n     allowed to extend them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other places the work was not laid out in tasks, but it is safe to\r\nsay that, judging from all reports and all probabilities, the amount of\r\nwork done did not equal that of the free labor of the North, then or\r\nnow. If it had the commercial supremacy of the South would have been\r\nlonger maintained.\r\n\r\nSome things regarding the agricultural work at once become prominent.\r\nAll work was done under the immediate eye of the task master. Thus there\r\nwas little occasion for the development of any sense of individual\r\nresponsibility for the work. As a rule the methods adopted were crude.\r\nLittle machinery was used, and that of the simplest. Hoes, heavy and\r\nclumsy, were the common tools. Within a year I have seen grass being\r\nmowed with hoes preparatory to putting the ground in cultivation. Even\r\ntoday the Negro has to be trained to use the light, sharp hoe of the\r\nNorth. Corn, cotton and, in a few districts, rice or tobacco were the\r\nstaple crops, although each plantation raised its own fruit and\r\nvegetables, and about the cabins in the quarters were little plots for\r\ngardens. The land was cultivated for a time, then abandoned for new,\r\nwhile in most places little attention was paid to rotation of crops or\r\nto fertilizers. The result was that large sections of the South had been\r\nseriously injured before the war. As some one has said:\r\n\r\n     \"The destruction of the soils by the methods of cultivation prior\r\n     to the war was worse than the ravages of the war. The _post bellum_\r\n     farmer received as an inheritance large areas of wornout and\r\n     generally unproductive soils.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYet all things were the master's. A failure of the crop meant little\r\nhunger to the black. Refusal to work could but bring bodily punishment,\r\nfor the master was seldom of the kind who would take life--a live Negro\r\nwas worth a good deal more than a dead one. Clothing and shelter were\r\nprovided, and care in sickness. The master must always furnish tools,\r\nland and seed, and see to it that the ground was cultivated. There was\r\nthus little necessity for the Negro to care for the morrow, and his\r\nAfrican training had not taught him to borrow trouble. Thus neither\r\nAfrica nor America had trained the Negro to independent, continuous\r\nlabor apart from the eye of the overseer. The requirements as to skill\r\nwere low. The average man learned little of the mysteries of fruit\r\ngrowing, truck farming and all the economies which make diversified\r\nagriculture profitable.\r\n\r\nFreedom came, a second sharp break with the past. There is now no one\r\nwho is responsible for food and clothing. For a time all is in\r\nconfusion. The war had wiped out the capital of the country. The whites\r\nwere land poor, the Negroes landless. It so happened that at this time\r\nthe price of cotton was high. The Negro knew more about cotton than any\r\nother crop. _Raise cotton_ became the order of the day. The money\r\nlenders would lend money on cotton, even in advance, for it had a\r\ncertain and sure ready sale. Thus developed the crop-lien system which\r\nin essence consists in taking a mortgage on crops yet to be raised. The\r\nsystem existed among the white planters for many years before the war.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of food and clothing was advanced to the Negro family\r\nuntil the crop could be harvested, when the money value of the goods\r\nreceived was returned with interest. Perhaps nothing which concerns the\r\nNegro has been the subject of more hostile criticism than this crop-lien\r\nsystem. That it is easily abused when the man on one side is a shrewd\r\nand cunning sharpster and the borrower an illiterate and trusting Negro\r\nis beyond doubt. That in thousands of cases advantage has been taken of\r\nthis fact to wrest from the Negro at the end of the year all that he had\r\nis not to be questioned. Certainly a system which makes it possible is\r\nopen to criticism. It should not be forgotten, however, that the system\r\ngrew out of the needs of the time and served a useful purpose when\r\nhonestly administered, even as it does today. No money could be gotten\r\nwith land as security, and even today the land owner often sees his\r\nmerchant with far less capital get money from the bank which has refused\r\nhis security. The system has enabled a poor man without tools and work\r\nanimals without food to get a start and be provided with a modicum of\r\nnecessities until the crops were harvested. Thousands have become more\r\nor less independent who started in this way. The evil influences of the\r\nsystem, for none would consider it ideal, have probably been that it has\r\nmade unnecessary any saving on the part of the Negro, who feels sure\r\nthat he can receive his advances and who cares little for the fact that\r\nsome day he must pay a big interest on what he receives. Secondly, this\r\nsystem has hindered the development of diversified farming, which today\r\nis one of the greatest needs of the South. The advances have been\r\nconditioned upon the planting and cultivating a given amount of cotton.\r\nDuring recent years no other staple has so fallen in price, and the\r\nresult has been hard on the farmers. All else has faded into\r\ninsignificance before the necessity of raising cotton. The result on the\r\nfertility of the soil is also evident. Luckily cotton makes light\r\ndemands on the land, but the thin soil of many districts has been unable\r\nto stand even the light demands. Guano came just in time and the later\r\ncommercial fertilizers have postponed the evil day. The development of\r\nthe cotton mills has also served to give a local market, which has\r\nstimulated the production of cotton. It seems rather evident, however,\r\nthat the increasing development of western lands will put a heavier\r\nburden upon the Atlantic slope. This, of course, will not affect the\r\nculture of sea-island cotton, which is grown in only a limited area. To\r\nmeet this handicap a more diversified agriculture must gradually\r\nsupplant in some way the present over-attention to cotton. In early days\r\nVirginia raised much cotton, now it stands towards the bottom of the\r\ncotton states. Perhaps it is safe to say that Virginia land has been as\r\nmuch injured by the more exhaustive crop, tobacco, as the other states\r\nby cotton. Large areas have been allowed to go back to the woods and\r\nlocal conditions have greatly changed. How this diversification is to be\r\nbrought about for the Negro is one of the most important questions.\r\nRecent years have witnessed an enormous development of truck farming,\r\nbut in this the Negro has borne little part. This intensive farming\r\nrequires a knowledge of soil and of plant life, coupled with much\r\nability in marketing wares, which the average Negro does not possess.\r\nNor has he taken any great part in the fruit industry, which is steadily\r\ngrowing. The question to which all this leads may be stated as follows.\r\nTo what extent is the Negro taking advantage of the opportunities he now\r\nhas on the farm? What is his present situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE PRESENT SITUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe southern states are not densely populated. Alabama has an average of\r\n35 per square mile; Georgia, 37; South Carolina, 44. These may be\r\ncompared with Iowa, 40; Indiana, 70, taking two of the typical northern\r\nfarming states, while Connecticut has 187. In the prairie section of\r\nAlabama the Negro population ranges from 30 to 50 per square mile, and\r\nthis is about the densest outside of the city counties. There is thus an\r\nabundance of land. As a matter of fact there is not the least difficulty\r\nfor the Negro farmer to get plenty of land, and he has but to show\r\nhimself a good tenant to have the whites offering him inducements.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A CABIN INTERIOR.=\r\n\r\n\r\nNegroes on the farms may be divided into four classes: Owners, cash\r\ntenants, share tenants, laborers. Share tenants differ from the same\r\nclass in the North in that work animals and tools are usually provided\r\nby the landlord. Among the laborers must also be included the families\r\nliving on the rice and cane plantations, who work for cash wages but\r\nreceive houses and such perquisites as do other tenants and whose\r\npermanence is more assured than an ordinary day hand. They are paid in\r\ncash, usually through a plantation store, that debts for provisions,\r\netc., may be deducted. Both owners and tenants find it generally\r\nnecessary to arrange for advances of food and clothing until harvest.\r\nThe advances begin in the early Spring and continue until August or\r\nsometimes until the cotton is picked. In the regions east of the\r\nalluvial lands advances usually stop by the first of August, and in the\r\ninterim until the cotton is sold odd jobs or some extra labor, picking\r\nblackberries and the like, must furnish the support for the family. The\r\nlandlord may do the advancing or some merchant. Money is seldom\r\nfurnished directly, although in recent years banks are beginning to loan\r\non crop-liens. The food supplied is often based on the number of working\r\nhands, irrespective of the number of children in the family. This is\r\noccasionally a hardship. The customary ration is a peck of corn meal and\r\nthree pounds of pork per week. Usually a crop-lien together with a bill\r\nof sale of any personal property is given as security, but in some\r\nstates landlords have a first lien upon all crops for rent and advances.\r\nIn all districts the tenant is allowed to cut wood for his fire, and\r\nfrequently has free pasture for his stock. There is much complaint that\r\nwhen there are fences about the house they are sometimes burned, being\r\nmore accessible than the timber, which may be at a distance and which\r\nhas to be cut. The landlords and the advancers have found it necessary\r\nto spend a large part of their time personally, or through agents called\r\n\"riders,\" going about the plantations to see that the crops are\r\ncultivated. The Negro knows how to raise cotton, but he may forget to\r\nplow, chop, or some other such trifle, unless reminded of the necessity.\r\nThus a considerable part of the excessive interest charged the Negro\r\nshould really be charged as wages of superintendence. If the\r\ninstructions of the riders are not followed, rations are cut off, and\r\nthus the recalcitrant brought to terms.\r\n\r\nFor a long time rations have been dealt out on Saturday. So Saturday has\r\ncome to be considered a holiday, or half-holiday at least. Early in the\r\nmorning the roads are covered with blacks on foot, horse back, mule back\r\nand in various vehicles, on their way to the store or village, there to\r\nspend the day loafing about in friendly discussion with neighbors. The\r\ncondition of the crops has little preventive influence, and the handicap\r\nto successful husbandry formed by the habit is easily perceived. Many\r\nefforts are being made to break up the custom, but it is up-hill work.\r\nAnother habit of the Negro which militates against his progress is his\r\nprowling about in all sorts of revels by night, thereby unfitting\r\nhimself for labor the next day. This trait also shows forth the general\r\nthoughtlessness of the Negro. His mule works by day, but is expected to\r\ncarry his owner any number of miles at night. Sunday is seldom a day of\r\nrest for the work animals. It is a curious fact that wherever the\r\nNegroes are most numerous there mules usually outnumber horses. There\r\nare several reasons for this. It has often been supposed that mules\r\nendure the heat better than horses. This is questionable. The mule,\r\nhowever, will do a certain amount and then quit, all inducements to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. The horse will go till he drops; moreover,\r\nwill not stand the abuse which the mule endures. The Negro does not bear\r\na good reputation for care of his animals. He neglects to feed and\r\nprovide for them. Their looks justify the criticism. The mule, valuable\r\nas he is for many purposes, is necessarily more expensive in the long\r\nrun than a self-perpetuating animal.\r\n\r\nIn all parts it is the custom for the Negroes to save a little garden\r\npatch about the house, which, if properly tended, would supply the\r\nfamily with vegetables throughout the year. This is seldom the case. A\r\nrecent Tuskegee catalog commenting on this says:\r\n\r\n     \"If they have any garden at all, it is apt to be choked with weeds\r\n     and other noxious growths. With every advantage of soil and\r\n     climate, and with a steady market if they live near any city or\r\n     large town, few of the colored farmers get any benefit from this,\r\n     one of the most profitable of all industries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact they care little for vegetables and seldom know how\r\nto prepare them for the table. The garden is regularly started in the\r\nSpring, but seldom amounts to much. I have ridden for a day with but a\r\nglimpse of a couple of attempts. As a result there will be a few\r\ncollards, turnips, gourds, sweet potatoes and beans, but the mass of the\r\npeople buy the little they need from the stores. A dealer in a little\r\ncountry store told me last summer that he would make about $75 an acre\r\non three acres of watermelons, although almost every purchaser could\r\nraise them if he would. In many regions wild fruits are abundant, and\r\nblackberries during the season are quite a staple, but they are seldom\r\ncanned. Some cattle are kept, but little butter is made, and milk is\r\nseldom on the bill of fare, the stock being sold when fat (?). Many\r\nfamilies keep chickens, usually of the variety known as \"dunghill\r\nfowls,\" which forage for themselves. But the market supplied with\r\nchickens by the small farmers, as it might easily be. Whenever\r\nopportunity offers, hunting and fishing become more than diversions, and\r\nthe fondness for coon and 'possum is proverbial.\r\n\r\nIn a study of dietaries of Negroes made under Tuskegee Institute and\r\nreported in Bulletin No. 38, Office of Experimental Stations, U. S.\r\nDept. of Agriculture, it is stated:\r\n\r\n     \"Comparing these negro dietaries with other dietaries and dietary\r\n     standards, it will be seen that--\r\n\r\n     \"(1) The quantities of protein are small. Roughly speaking, the\r\n     food of these negroes furnished one-third to three-fourths as much\r\n     protein as are called for in the current physiological standards\r\n     and as are actually found in the dietaries of well fed whites in\r\n     the United States and well fed people in Europe. They were, indeed,\r\n     no larger than have been found in the dietaries of the very poor\r\n     factory operatives and laborers in Germany and the laborers and\r\n     beggars in Italy.\r\n\r\n     \"(2) In fuel value the Negro dietaries compare quite favorably with\r\n     those of well-to-do people of the laboring classes in Europe and\r\n     the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis indicates the ignorance of the Negro regarding the food he needs,\r\nso that in a region of plenty he is underfed as regards the muscle and\r\nbone forming elements and overfed so far as fuel value is concerned. One\r\ncannot help asking what effect a normal diet would have upon the sexual\r\npassions. It is worthy of notice that in the schools maintained by the\r\nwhites there is relatively little trouble on this account. Possibly the\r\nchanged life and food are in no small measure responsible for the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nUnder diversified farming there would be steady employment most of the\r\nyear, with a corresponding increase of production. As it is there are\r\ntwo busy seasons. In the Spring, planting and cultivating cotton, say\r\nfrom March to July, and in the Fall, cotton picking, September to\r\nDecember. The balance of the time the average farmer does little work.\r\nThe present system entails a great loss of time.\r\n\r\nThe absence of good pastures and of meadows is noticeable. This is also\r\ntoo true of white farmers. Yet the grasses grow luxuriantly and nothing\r\nbut custom or something else accounts for their absence; the something\r\nelse is cotton. The adaptability of cotton to the Negro is almost\r\nprovidential. It has a long tap root and is able to stand neglect and\r\nyet produce a reasonable crop. The grains, corn and cane, with their\r\nsurface roots, will not thrive under careless handling.\r\n\r\nThe average farmer knows, or at least utilizes few of the little\r\neconomies which make agriculture so profitable elsewhere. The Negro is\r\nthus under a heavy handicap and does not get the most that he might from\r\npresent opportunities. I am fully conscious that there are many farmers\r\nwho take advantage of these things and are correspondingly successful,\r\nbut they are not the average man of whom I am speaking. With this\r\ngeneral statement I pass to a consideration of the situation in the\r\nvarious districts before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIDE WATER VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia sea shore consists of a number of peninsulas separated by\r\nnarrow rivers (salt water). The country along the shore and the rivers\r\nis flat, with low hills in the interior. North of Old Point Comfort the\r\ndistrict is scarcely touched by railroads and is accessible only by\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\nGloucester County, lying between York River and Mob Jack Bay, is an\r\ninteresting region. The hilly soil of the central part sells at from $5\r\nto $10 per acre, while the flat coast land, which is richer although\r\nharder to drain, is worth from $25 to $50. The immediate water front has\r\nrisen in price in recent years and brings fancy prices for residence\r\npurposes. Curiously enough some of the best land of the county is that\r\nbeneath the waters of the rivers--the oyster beds. Land for this use may\r\nbe worth from nothing to many hundreds of dollars an acre, according to\r\nits nature. The county contains 250 square miles, 6,224 whites and 6,608\r\nblacks, the latter forming 51 per cent of the population.\r\n\r\nThis sea coast region offers peculiar facilities for gaining an easy\r\nlivelihood. There are few negro families of which some member does not\r\nspend part of the year fishing or oystering. There has been a great\r\ndevelopment of the oyster industry. The season lasts from September 1 to\r\nMay 1, and good workmen not infrequently make $2 a day or more when they\r\ncan work on the public beds. This last clause is significant. It is\r\nstated that the men expect to work most of September, October and\r\nNovember; one-half of December and January; one-third of February; any\r\ntime in March is clear gain and all of April. According to a careful\r\nstudy[8] of the oyster industry it was found that the oystermen, _i. e._,\r\nthose who dig the oysters from the rocks, make about $8 a month, while\r\nfamilies occupied in shucking oysters earn up to $400 a year,\r\nthree-fourths of them gaining less than $250. The public beds yield less\r\nthan formerly and the business is gradually going into the hands of\r\nfirms maintaining their own beds, with a corresponding reduction in\r\npossible earnings for the oystermen.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this industry is twofold; a considerable sum of money is\r\nbrought into the county and much of this has been invested in homes and\r\nsmall farms. This is the bright side; but there is a dark side. The boys\r\nare drawn out of the schools by the age of 12 to work at shucking\r\noysters, and during the winter months near the rivers the boys will\r\nattend only on stormy days. The men are also taken away from the farms\r\ntoo early in the fall to gather crops, and return too late in the spring\r\nto get the best results from the farm work. The irregular character of\r\nthe employment reacts on the men and they tend to drift to the cities\r\nduring the summer, although many find employment in berry picking about\r\nNorfolk. Another result has been to make farm labor very scarce. This\r\nnaturally causes some complaint. I do not say that the bad results\r\noutweigh the good, but believe they must be considered.\r\n\r\nThe population is scattered over the county, there being no towns of any\r\nsize, and is denser along the rivers than inland. The relations between\r\nthe two races are most friendly, although less satisfactory between the\r\nyounger generation. The Negroes make no complaints of ill treatment. In\r\nthe last ten years there have been only four Negroes sentenced to the\r\nstate prison, while in the twelve months prior to May 1, 1903, I was\r\ntold that there was but one trial for misdemeanor. It may be that the\r\nabsence of many of the young men for several months a year accounts in\r\npart for the small amount of crime. The jail stands empty most of the\r\ntime. The chief offenses are against the fish and oyster laws of the\r\nstate. Whites and blacks both claim that illegitimate children are much\r\nrarer than formerly. I was told of a case in which a young white man was\r\nfined for attempting to seduce a colored girl. The races have kept in\r\ntouch. White ministers still preach in negro churches, address\r\nSunday-schools, etc.\r\n\r\nIn all save a few of the poorer districts the old one-roomed cabin has\r\ngiven place to a comfortable house of several rooms. The houses are\r\noften white-washed, although their completion may take a good many\r\nyears. Stoves have supplanted fireplaces. The fences about the yards are\r\noften neat and in good repair. So far as housing conditions are\r\nconcerned, I have seen no rural district of the South to compare with\r\nthis. The old cabin is decidedly out of fashion.\r\n\r\nTurning to the farm proper, there are other evidences of change. There\r\nare no women working in the fields, their time being spent about the\r\nhouse and the garden. The system of crop liens is unknown. Each farmer\r\nraises his own supplies, smokes his own meat or buys at the store for\r\ncash or on credit. Wheat and corn are ground in local mills. The heavy\r\ninterest charges of other districts are thus avoided. It is stated that\r\na great number of the Negroes are buying little places, and this bears\r\nout the census figures, which show that of the Negro farmers 90.9 per\r\ncent in this county are owners or managers; the average for the negroes\r\nas a whole is 27.1 per cent.\r\n\r\nAlthough so many earn money in the oyster business, there are others who\r\nhave gotten ahead by sticking to the farm. T---- now owns part of the\r\nplace on which he was a slave, and his slave-time cabin is now used as a\r\nshed. He began buying land in 1873, paying from $10 to $11.50 per acre,\r\nand by hard work and economy now owns sixty acres which are worth much\r\nmore than their first cost. With the help of his boys, whom he has\r\nmanaged to keep at home, he derives a comfortable income from his land.\r\nHis daughter, now his housekeeper, teaches school near by during the\r\nwinter. What he has done others can do, he says.\r\n\r\nY---- is another who has succeeded. His first payments were made from\r\nthe sale of wood cut in clearing the land. In 1903 his acres were\r\nplanted as follows:\r\n\r\n  Orchard          2 acres.\r\n  Woodland         8 acres.\r\n  Pasture         10 acres.\r\n  Corn             8 acres.\r\n  Rye            3/4 acres.\r\n  Potato patch\r\n  Garden and yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis children are being trained at Hampton, and he laughingly says that\r\none boy is already telling him how to get more produce from his land.\r\n\r\nB---- is an oysterman during the winter. He has purchased a small place\r\nof four acres, for which he paid $18 per acre. This ground he cultivates\r\nand has a few apple, plum and peach trees in his yard. His case is\r\ntypical.\r\n\r\nWages in the county are not high. House servants get from $3 to $8 per\r\nmonth. Day laborers are paid from 50 to 75 cents a day. Farm hands get\r\nabout $10 a month and two meals daily (breakfast and dinner). I have\r\nalready mentioned that farm laborers were getting fewer, and those left\r\nare naturally the less reliable. Many white farmers are having\r\nconsiderable difficulty in carrying on their places. The result is that\r\nmany are only partially cultivating the farms, and many of the younger\r\nmen are abandoning agriculture. What the final result will be is hard to\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing it may be said that agriculture is being somewhat\r\nneglected and that the opportunity to earn money in the oyster industry\r\nacts as a constant deterrent to agricultural progress, if it is not\r\ndirectly injurious. Here, as elsewhere, there is room for improvement in\r\nmethods of tilling the soil and in rotation of crops, use of animal\r\nmanures, etc.\r\n\r\nThe general social and moral improvement has been noted. It is a\r\npleasure to find that one of the strongest factors in this improvement\r\nis due to the presence in the county of a number of graduates of Hampton\r\nwho, in their homes, their schools and daily life, have stood for better\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of making general statements true in all districts has\r\nelsewhere been mentioned. The reader will not be surprised, therefore,\r\nto find many things said in the immediately preceding pages inapplicable\r\nto conditions in the tobacco districts. The little town of Farmville,\r\nVa., is the market for some 12,000,000 pounds of tobacco yearly. The\r\ncounty Prince Edward contained in 1890 9,924 Negroes and in 1900 but\r\n9,769, a decrease of 155. The county does not give one the impression of\r\nagricultural prosperity. The surface is very rolling, the soil sandy and\r\nthin in many places. Along the bottoms there is good land, of less value\r\nthan formerly because of freshets. Practically all of the land has been\r\nunder cultivation at some time, and in heavily wooded fields the corn\r\nrows may often be traced. On every side are worn-out fields on which\r\nsassafras soon gets a hold, followed by pine and other trees.\r\n\r\nLabor conditions have been growing worse, according to common report. It\r\nis harder to get farm hands than formerly, and this difficulty is most\r\nfelt by those who exact the most. The day laborer gets from 40 to 50\r\ncents and his meals, while for special work, such as cutting wheat, the\r\nwage may rise to $1.50. Women no longer work in the fields, and about\r\nthe house get 35 cents per day. Formerly women worked in the fields, and\r\nwages for both sexes were lower. Hands by the month get $7 to $8 and\r\nboard. In this county are many small white farmers who work in the\r\nfields with the men, and the white housewife not infrequently cooks the\r\nfood for the Negroes--quite a contrast to typical southern practice.\r\n\r\nThe movement from the farm is not an unmixed evil in that it is\r\ncompelling the introduction of improved machinery, such as mowing\r\nmachines, binders. On many a farm only scythes and cradles are known.\r\n\r\nAnother element in the problem is the fact that many negroes have been\r\ngetting little places of their own and therefore do less work for\r\nothers. There are many whites who think this development a step forward\r\nand believe that the land owners are better citizens. There are others\r\nwho claim that the net result is a loss, in that they are satisfied\r\nmerely to eke out some sort of an existence and are not spurred on to\r\nincreased production. It is quite commonly reported that there were some\r\norganizations among the Negroes whose members agreed not to work for the\r\nwhites, but I cannot vouch for their existence.\r\n\r\nAlthough agriculture here is much more diversified than in the cotton\r\nbelt, the Negro finds it necessary to get advances. These are usually\r\nsupplied by commission merchants, who furnish the fertilizers and\r\nnecessary food, taking crop liens as security. Advances begin in the\r\nspring and last until the following December, when the tobacco is\r\nmarketed. The interest charged is 6 per cent, but the goods sold on this\r\nplan are much enhanced in price; interest is usually charged for a year,\r\nand the merchant receives a commission of 2-1/2 per cent for selling the\r\ntobacco, so the business appears fairly profitable.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the average value of an acre of tobacco, as\r\nit varies so much in quality as well as quantity. It is probably safe to\r\nsay that the Negroes do not average over $20 per acre, ranging from $15\r\nto $25, and have perhaps three or four acres in tobacco. It is generally\r\nexpected that the tobacco will about pay for the advances. This would\r\nindicate, and the commission men confirm it, that the average advance is\r\nbetween $50 and $75 per year. The rations given out are no longer merely\r\npork and meal, with which it is stated that the Negroes are not now\r\ncontent, but include a more varied diet.\r\n\r\nThe customary rent is one-fourth of all that is produced, the landlord\r\npaying one-fourth of the fertilizer (universally called guano in this\r\ndistrict). Tobacco makes heavy demands on the soil and at least 400\r\npounds, a value of about $4.50 per acre, should be used. When the\r\nlandlord furnishes the horse or mule he pays also one-half of the\r\nfertilizer and gets one-half of the produce. The rent on tobacco land is\r\nthus large, but the average cash rental is between $2 and $3.\r\n\r\nThe standard rotation of crops is tobacco, wheat, clover, tobacco. The\r\nclover is not infrequently skipped, the field lying fallow or\r\nuncultivated until exhausted. The average farmer thus has about as many\r\nacres in wheat as in tobacco and raises perhaps twelve bushels of wheat\r\nper acre. Some corn is also raised, and I have seen fields so exhausted\r\nthat the stalk at the ground was scarcely larger than my middle finger.\r\nThe corn crop may possibly average 10 to 15 bushels per acre, or, in\r\nVirginia terminology, 2 to 3 barrels.\r\n\r\nThe average farmer under present conditions just about meets his\r\nadvances with the tobacco raised. He has about enough wheat to supply\r\nhim with flour; perhaps enough corn and hay for his ox or horse;\r\npossibly enough meat for the family. The individual family may fall\r\nshort on any of these. The hay crop is unsatisfactory, largely through\r\nneglect. In May, 1903, on a Saturday, I saw wagon after wagon leaving\r\nFarmville carrying bales of western hay. This is scarcely an indication\r\nof thrift.\r\n\r\nThe impression one gets from traveling about is that the extensive\r\ncultivation of tobacco, in spite of the fact that it is the cash crop\r\nand perhaps also the most profitable, is really a drawback in that other\r\npossibilities are obscured. It may be that the line of progress will not\r\nbe to abandon tobacco, but to introduce more intensive cultivation, for\r\nthe average man, white or black, does not get a proper return from an\r\nacre. To-day there is always a likelihood that more tobacco will be\r\nplanted than can be properly cultivated, for it is a plant which demands\r\nconstant and careful attention until it is marketed.\r\n\r\nB---- has a big family of children and lives in a large cabin, one room\r\nwith a loft. He owns a pair of oxen and manages to raise enough to feed\r\nthem. He also raises about enough meat for his family. During the season\r\nof 1902 he raised $175 worth of tobacco; corn valued at $37.50 and 16\r\nbushels of wheat, a total of about $221. Deducting one-fourth for rent\r\nand estimating his expenses for fertilizer at $25, he had about $140 out\r\nof which to pay all other expenses. B---- is considered a very good man,\r\nwho tends carefully and faithfully to his work. It is evident, however,\r\nthat his margin is small.\r\n\r\nThe farmer has opportunities to supplement his earnings. Cordwood finds\r\nready sale in the towns at $2 per cord, and I have seen many loads of\r\nnot over one-fourth of a cord hauled to market by a small steer. Butter,\r\neggs and chickens yield some returns and the country produces\r\nblackberries in profusion.\r\n\r\nThere are some Negroes who are making a comfortable living on the farms\r\nand whose houses and yards are well kept. As has been said, this is not\r\nthe general impression made by the district. Considerable sums of money\r\nare sent in by children working in the northern cities. This is offset,\r\nhowever, by those who come back in the winter to live off their parents,\r\nhaving squandered all their own earnings elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe situation in a word is: A generation or more of reliance on one\r\ncrop, neglect of other crops and of stock, resulting in deteriorated\r\nland. The labor force attracted to the towns and the North by higher\r\nwages. Natural result: Decadence of agricultural conditions, affording\r\nat the same time a chance for many Negroes to become land owners. When\r\nthe process will stop or the way out I know not. Perhaps the German\r\nimmigrants who are beginning to buy up some of the farms may lead the\r\nway to a better husbandry.\r\n\r\nFor an interesting account of conditions in the town of Farmville see\r\n\"The Negroes of Farmville,\" by W. E. B. DuBois, Bulletin Department of\r\nLabor, January, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA COAST.\r\n\r\n=A SEA-ISLAND CABIN.=\r\n\r\nThe low-lying coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with its fringe of\r\nislands, has long been the seat of a heavy Negro population. Of the\r\ncounties perhaps none is more interesting than Beaufort, the\r\nsouthernmost of South Carolina. The eastern half of the county is cut up\r\nby many salt rivers into numerous islands. Broad River separates these\r\nfrom the mainland. The Plant System has a line on the western edge of\r\nthe county, while the Georgia Railroad runs east to Port Royal.\r\nAccording to the census, the county contains 943 square miles of land\r\nand a population of 32,137 blacks and 3,349 whites, the Negroes thus\r\nforming 90 per cent of the total. There are 37 persons to the square\r\nmile. With the exception of Beaufort and Port Royal, the whites are\r\nfound on the western side of the county. The islands are almost solid\r\nblack. Just after the war many of the plantations were sold for taxes\r\nand fell into the hands of the Negroes, the funds realized being set\r\napart for the education of the blacks, the interest now amounting to\r\nsome $2,000 a year. In the seventies there was a great development of\r\nthe phosphate industry, which at its height employed hundreds of\r\nNegroes, taken from the farms. Enormous fertilizer plants were erected.\r\nMost of this is now a thing of the past and the dredges lie rotting at\r\nthe wharves. It is the general opinion that the influence of this\r\nindustry was not entirely beneficial, although it set much money in\r\ncirculation. It drew the men from the farms, and now they tend to drift\r\nto the cities rather than return.\r\n\r\nA livelihood is easily gained. The creeks abound with fish, crabs and\r\noysters. There is plenty of work on the farms for those who prefer more\r\nsteady labor. Land valued at about $10 per acre may be rented for $1.\r\nMore than ten acres to the tenant is not usual, and I was told that it\r\nis very common for a family to rent all the land it wants for $10 per\r\nyear, the presumption being that not over ten acres would be utilized.\r\nThe staple crop for the small farmer is the sea island cotton. Under the\r\npresent culture land devoted to this lies fallow every other year. The\r\nislands are low and flat, subject to severe storms, that of 1893 having\r\ndestroyed many lives and much property. The county was originally\r\nheavily wooded and there is still an abundance for local purposes,\r\nthough the supply is low in places. On the islands the blacks have been\r\nalmost alone for a generation and by many it is claimed that there has\r\nbeen a decided retrogression. By common consent St. Helena Island, which\r\nlies near Beaufort, is considered the most prosperous of the Negro\r\ndistricts. On this island are over 8,000 blacks and some 200 whites. The\r\ncabins usually have two rooms, many having been partitioned to make the\r\nsecond. They are of rough lumber, sometimes whitewashed, but seldom\r\npainted. There are few fences and some damage is done by stock.\r\nOutbuildings are few; privies are almost unknown--even at the schools\r\nthere are no closets of any kind. The wells are shallow, six feet or so\r\nin depth with a few driven to 12 or 17 feet. A few have pumps, the rest\r\nare open. At present there is no dispensary on the island but there are\r\na number of \"blind tigers.\" The nearest physician is at Beaufort and the\r\ncost of a single visit is from five to ten dollars. The distance from\r\nthe doctors is said not to be an unmixed evil as it saves much foolish\r\nexpenditure of money in fancied ills.\r\n\r\nIn slavery times there were 61 plantations on the island and their\r\nnames, as Fripps Corner, Oaks, still survive to designate localities.\r\nThere was in olden times little contact with the whites as Negro drivers\r\nwere common. Each plantation still has its \"prayer house\" at which\r\nreligious services are held. Meetings occur on different nights on the\r\nvarious plantations to enable the people to get all the religion they\r\nneed. These meetings are often what are known as \"shouts,\" when with\r\nmuch shouting and wild rhythmic dancing the participants keep on till\r\nexhausted. The suggestion of Africa is not vague. The Virginia Negro\r\nviews these gatherings with as much astonishment as does any white. Many\r\nof the blacks speak a strange dialect hard to understand. \"Shum,\" for\r\ninstance, being the equivalent for \"see them.\"\r\n\r\nThe land is sandy and should have skillful handling to get the best\r\nresults. Yet the farming is very unscientific. The first plowing is\r\nshallow and subsequent cultivation is done almost entirely with hoes.\r\nWhen a Hampton graduate began some new methods last year the people came\r\nfor miles to see his big plow. It is said that there was more plowing\r\nthan usual as a result. The daily life of the farmer is about as\r\nfollows: Rising between four and five he goes directly to the field,\r\neating nothing until eight or nine, when he has some \"grits,\" a sort of\r\nfine hominy cooked like oat meal. Many eat nothing until they leave the\r\nfield at eleven for dinner, which also consists of grits with some crabs\r\nin summer and fish in winter. Some have only these two meals a day. Corn\r\nbread and molasses are almost unknown and when they have molasses it is\r\neaten with a spoon. Knives and forks are seldom used. One girl of\r\neighteen did not know how to handle a knife. There are numbers of cows\r\non the island, but milk is seldom served, the cattle being sold for\r\nbeef. The draft animals are usually small oxen or ponies, called \"salt\r\nmarsh tackies,\" as they are left to pick their living from the marshes.\r\nSome chickens and turkeys are raised, but no great dependence is placed\r\non them. There are no geese and few ducks. Little commercial fertilizer\r\nis used, the marsh grass, which grows in great abundance, being an\r\nexcellent substitute of which the more progressive take advantage. The\r\nfollowing statement will illustrate the situation of three typical\r\nfamilies, an unusual, a good, and an average farmer. The figures are for\r\n1902:\r\n\r\n                          No. 1.       No. 2.

From January 1, 1902, to July 15 (which is near the close of the\r\nadvancing season) several average families had gotten advances averaging\r\n$15.00. The firm which does most of the advancing on the island writes:\r\n\"We have some that get more. A few get $50.00 or about that amount, but\r\nwe make it a point not to let the colored people or our customers get\r\ntoo much in debt. We have to determine about what they need and we have\r\nalways given them what was necessary to help them make a crop according\r\nto their conditions and circumstances as they present themselves to us.\"\r\nThe firm reports that they collect each year about 90 per cent of their\r\noutstanding accounts.\r\n\r\nBelow are given the customary forms of the Bill of Sale and the Crop\r\nLien given to secure advances:\r\n\r\n    THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA,\r\n        COUNTY OF BEAUFORT.\r\n\r\n     Know all men by these presents, that ............ of the said\r\n     County, in consideration of the sum of ............ dollars, to be\r\n     advanced in merchandise by ............, of Beaufort County and\r\n     State, have bargained and sold unto the said ............ the\r\n     following personal property, ............, now in my possession,\r\n     and which I promise to deliver on demand of the said ............\r\n\r\n     (Signed)                                    .....................\r\n\r\n     $............\r\n\r\n\r\n     On the .... day of 19.., I promise to pay to the order of\r\n     ............ ..........., at Beaufort, South Carolina, ............\r\n     dollars for money and supplies to be advanced and furnished me by\r\n     the said ............, merchants, Beaufort, South Carolina, for use\r\n     in the cultivation of crops on the plantation or farm cultivated by\r\n     me in Beaufort County, South Carolina, known as the ............\r\n     plantation, and containing about ............ acres, during the\r\n     year 190...\r\n\r\n     And in consideration of the said advance made me I hereby give,\r\n     make and grant to the said ............ a lien to the extent of\r\n     said advance on all the crops which may be grown on the said\r\n     plantation or farm during the year 190.., wherever said crops or\r\n     parts of them are found.\r\n\r\n     This lien hereby given is executed and to be enforced in accordance\r\n     with the laws of the State of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n     I, the said ............, in consideration of the foregoing, do\r\n     hereby agree to advance to the said ........... ..... dollars, as\r\n     above stated.\r\n\r\n     Witness the hands and seals of both parties.\r\n\r\n    In the presence of                              ............, L. S.\r\n       ............                                 ............, L. S.\r\n\r\nThis is then recorded in the County Court as is an ordinary mortgage.\r\n\r\nOn this island considerable money has been saved and is now deposited\r\nwith a firm of merchants in whom the people have confidence. In July,\r\n1902, there were about 100 individual depositors having some $4,000 to\r\ntheir credit. The money can be withdrawn at any time, all debts to the\r\nfirm being first settled. Interest at five per cent. is allowed. Some of\r\nthis money comes from pensions. There are round about Beaufort a\r\nconsiderable number of U. S. pensioners, as the city was headquarters\r\nfor Union soldiers for a long time. The effect of the pensions is\r\nclaimed both by whites and blacks to be bad.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the credit for the good conditions, relatively speaking,\r\nwhich prevail on St. Helena is given to the Penn School which for years\r\nhas come into close touch with the lives of the people. The Negroes have\r\nalso been in touch with a good class of whites, who have encouraged all\r\nefforts at improvement. Wherever the credit lies, the visitor is struck\r\nby the difference between conditions here and on some other islands, for\r\ninstance, Lady's Island, which lies between St. Helena and Beaufort.\r\nEven here it is claimed that the older generation is more industrious.\r\n\r\nIn the trucking industry, which is very profitable along the coast, the\r\nNegroes have only been engaged as ordinary laborers. On the main land,\r\nwherever fresh water can be obtained, is the seat of a considerable rice\r\nindustry. In recent years, owing to the cutting of the forests in the\r\nhills, the planters are troubled by freshets in the spring and droughts\r\nin the summer. The work is done by Negroes under direction of white\r\nforemen. The men work harder on contract jobs, but work by the day is\r\nbetter done. Women are in better repute as laborers than the men and it\r\nis stated that more women support their husbands than formerly was the\r\ncase. Wages range from $.35 to $.50 per day, varying somewhat according\r\nto the work done. They are paid in cash and the planters have given up\r\nthe plantation store in many cases. All work must be constantly\r\nsupervised and it is said to be harder and harder to get work done. A\r\nplanter found it almost impossible in the winter of 1901 to get fifty\r\ncords of wood cut, the work being considered too heavy. When I left the\r\ntrain at Beaufort and found twelve hacks waiting for about three\r\npassengers it was evident where some of the labor force had gone.\r\n\r\nIn this county there is a great development of burial and sick benefit\r\nsocieties. The \"Morning Star\", \"Star of Hope\", \"Star of Bethlehem\" are\r\ntypical names. The dues are from five to ten cents a week. Many of the\r\nsocieties have good sized halls, rivaling ofttimes the churches, on the\r\nvarious islands, which are used for lodge and social purposes.\r\n\r\nBeaufort and the other towns offer the country people an opportunity to\r\ndispose of fish and any garden produce they may raise, while it is not\r\nuncommon to see a little ox dragging a two-wheeled cart and perhaps a\r\nquarter of a cord of wood to be hawked about town. During part of the\r\nsummer a good many gather a species of plant which is used in\r\nadulterating cigarettes and cigars.\r\n\r\nThis little account indicates that, so far as the farmers are concerned,\r\nthere are few evidences of any decided progress save in the district\r\nwhich has been under the influence of one school. The ease of getting a\r\nlivelihood acts as a deterrent to ambition. Yet the old families say\r\nthat they have the \"best niggers of the South\" and certain it is that\r\nrace troubles are unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n=THE OLD CABIN.=\r\n\r\nIn the central district life is a little more strenuous than on the sea\r\ncoast. The cabins are about the same. The average tenant has a \"one mule\r\nfarm,\" some thirty or thirty-five acres. Occasionally the tenant has\r\nmore land, but only about this amount is cultivated and no rent is paid\r\nfor the balance. The area of the land is usually estimated and only\r\nrarely is it surveyed. This land ranges in value from $5.00 to $15.00\r\nper acre on the average. The customary rental for a \"one mule farm\" is\r\nabout two bales of cotton, whose value in recent years would be in the\r\nneighborhood of $75.00, thus making the rental about $3.00 per acre. On\r\nthis farm from four to six bales of cotton are raised. The soil has been\r\ninjured by improper tillage and requires an expenditure of $1.75 to\r\n$2.00 per acre for fertilizers if the best results are to be obtained.\r\nAs yet the Negroes do not fully appreciate this. The farmer secures\r\nadvances based on 1 peck of meal and 3 pounds of \"side meat,\" fat salt\r\npork, per week for each working hand. About six dollars a month is the\r\nlimit for advances and as these are continued for only seven months or\r\nso the average advance received is probably not far from $50.00 per\r\nyear. An advance of $10.00 per month is allowed for a two horse farm.\r\nThe advancer obligates himself to furnish only necessities and any\r\nincidentals must be supplied from sale of poultry, berries and the like.\r\nClothing may often be reckoned as an incidental. The luxuries are bought\r\nwith cash or on the installment plan and are seldom indicated by the\r\nbooks of the merchant. The cost of the average weekly advances for a\r\nfamily in 1902 was:\r\n\r\n  10 pounds meat (salt port sides) @ 13-1/2c   $1.35\r\n   1 bushel corn meal                            .90\r\n   1 plug tobacco (reckoned a necessity)         .10\r\n                                               ------\r\n                                               $2.35\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE NEW HOUSE.=\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions throughout this district are believed to be fairly uniform,\r\nbut the following information was gathered in Lowndes County, Alabama,\r\nso has closest connection with the prairie region of that state:\r\n\r\nLowndes County lies just southwest of Montgomery and there are 47\r\npersons to the square mile. The Negroes form 86 per cent. of the\r\npopulation. East and West throughout the county runs the Chennenugga\r\nRidge, a narrow belt of hills which separate the prairie from the pine\r\nhills to the South. The ridge is quite broken and in places can not be\r\ntilled profitably. The county is of average fertility, however.\r\n\r\nThere are not an unusual number of one-room cabins. Out of 74 families,\r\ncomprising 416 people, the average was 7 to the room, the greatest\r\nnumber living in one room was 11. The families were housed as follows:\r\n\r\n     No.        No.         Largest No.       Average No.\r\n  Families.    Rooms.        Persons.

The man\r\nusually eats breakfast in the field, the wife staying behind to prepare\r\nit. It consists of pork and corn bread. The family come from the field\r\nabout noon and have dinner consisting of pork and corn bread, with\r\ncollards, turnip greens, roasting ears, etc. At sundown work stops and\r\nsupper is eaten, the menu being as at breakfast. The pork eaten by the\r\nNegroes, it may be said, is almost solid fat, two or three inches thick,\r\nlean meat not being liked. The housewife has few dishes, the food being\r\ncooked in pots or in small ovens set among the ashes. Stoves are a\r\nrarity. Lamps are occasionally used, but if the chimney be broken it is\r\nrarely replaced, the remainder being quite good enough for ordinary\r\npurposes. The cabins seldom have glass windows, but instead wooden\r\nshutters, which swing outward on hinges. These are shut at night and\r\neven during the hottest summer weather there is practically no\r\nventilation. How it is endured I know not, but the custom prevails even\r\nin Porto Rico I am told. In winter the cabins are cold. To meet this the\r\nthrifty housewife makes bed quilts and as many as 25 or 30 of these are\r\nnot infrequently found in a small cabin. The floors are rough and not\r\nalways of matched lumber, while the cabins are poorly built. The usual\r\nmeans of heating, and cooking, is the big fireplace. Sometimes the\r\nchimney is built of sticks daubed over with mud, the top of the chimney\r\noften failing to reach the ridge of the roof. Fires sometimes result.\r\nTables and chairs are rough and rude. Sheets are few, the mattresses are\r\nof cotton, corn shucks or pine straw, and the pillows of home grown\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nThe following regarding the cooking of the Alabama Negro is taken from a\r\nletter published in Bulletin No. 38, U. S. Department of Agriculture,\r\nOffice of the Experiment Stations:\r\n\r\n     \"The daily fare is prepared in very simple ways. Corn meal is mixed\r\n     with water and baked on the flat surface of a hoe or griddle. The\r\n     salt pork is sliced thin and fried until very brown and much of the\r\n     grease tried out. Molasses from cane or sorghum is added to the\r\n     fat, making what is known as 'sap,' which is eaten with the corn\r\n     bread. Hot water sweetened with molasses is used as a beverage.\r\n     This is the hill of fare of most of the cabins on the plantations\r\n     of the 'black belt' three times a day during the year. It is,\r\n     however, varied at times; thus collards and turnips are boiled with\r\n     the bacon, the latter being used with the vegetables to supply fat\r\n     'to make it rich.' The corn meal bread is sometimes made into\r\n     so-called 'cracklin bread,' and is prepared as follows: A piece of\r\n     fat bacon is fried until it is brittle; it is then crushed and\r\n     mixed with corn meal, water, soda and salt, and baked in an oven\r\n     over the fireplace.... One characteristic of the cooking is that\r\n     all meats are fried or otherwise cooked until they are crisp.\r\n     Observation among these people reveals the fact that very many of\r\n     them suffer from indigestion in some form.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere the advances are supplied by the planter or some merchant.\r\nThe legal rate of interest is 8 per cent, but no Negro ever borrows\r\nmoney at this rate. Ten per cent. per year is considered cheap, while on\r\nshort terms the rate is often 10 per cent. per week. The average tenant\r\npays from 12.5 per cent. to 15 per cent. for his advances, which are\r\nsold at an average of 25 per cent. higher than cash prices on the\r\naverage. To avoid any possible trouble it is quite customary to reckon\r\nthe interest and then figure this into the face of the note so that none\r\ncan tell either the principal or the rate. Below is an actual copy of\r\nsuch a note, the names being changed:\r\n\r\n     $22.00.

C. COOK.                    SAM SMALL. L. S.\r\n             R. J. BENNETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be granted that experience has shown all this verbiage to be\r\nnecessary. In the hands of an honest landlord it is as meaningless as\r\nthat in the ordinary contract we sign in renting a house. In the hands\r\nof a dishonest landlord or merchant it practically enables him to make a\r\nserf of the Negro. The mortgage is supposed to be filed at once, but it\r\nis sometimes held to see if there is any other security which might be\r\nincluded. The rascally creditor watches the crop and if the Negro may\r\nhave a surplus he easily tempts him to buy more, or more simply still,\r\nhe charges to his account imaginary purchases, so that at the end of the\r\nyear the Negro is still in debt. The Negro has no redress. He can not\r\nprove that he has not purchased the goods and his word will not stand\r\nagainst the merchant's. Practically he is tied down to the land, for no\r\none else will advance him under these conditions. Sometimes he escapes\r\nby getting another merchant to settle his account and by becoming the\r\ntenant of the new man. When it is remembered that land is abundant and\r\ngood labor rare, the temptation to hold a man on the land by fair means\r\nor foul is apparent. Moreover, the merchant by specious reasoning often\r\njustifies his own conduct. He says that the Negro will spend his money\r\nat the first opportunity and that he might just as well have it as some\r\nother merchant. I would not be understood as saying that this action is\r\nanything but the great exception but there are dishonest men everywhere\r\nwho are ready to take advantage of their weaker fellows and the Negro\r\nsuffers as a result, just as the ignorant foreigner does in the cities\r\nof the North.\r\n\r\nThe interest may also be reckoned into the face of the mortgage. In any\r\ncase it begins the day the paper is signed, although the money or its\r\nequivalent is only received at intervals and a full year's interest is\r\npaid, often on the face of the mortgage, even if only two-thirds of it\r\nhas actually been advanced to the Negro, no matter when the account is\r\nsettled. The helplessness of the Negro who finds himself in the hands of\r\na sharper is obvious when that sharper has practical control of the\r\nsituation. In many and curious ways the landlord seeks to hold his\r\ntenants. He is expected to stand by them in time of trouble, to protect\r\nthem against the aggressions of other blacks and of whites as well. This\r\npaternalism is often carried to surprising lengths.\r\n\r\nThe size of a man's family is known and the riders see to it that he\r\nkeeps all the working hands in the field. If the riders have any trouble\r\nwith a Negro they are apt to take it out in physical punishment, to\r\n\"wear him out,\" as the phrase goes. Thus resentment is seldom harbored\r\nagainst a Negro and there are many who claim that this physical\r\ndiscipline is far better than any prison regime in its effects upon the\r\nNegro. In spite of all that is done it is claimed that the Negroes are\r\ngetting less reliable and that the chief dependence is now in the older\r\nmen, the women and the children. One remark, made by a planter's wife,\r\nwhich impressed me as having a good deal of significance, was, \"the\r\nNegroes do not sing as much now as formerly.\"\r\n\r\nTo get at anything like an accurate statement of the income and expenses\r\nof a Negro family is a difficult matter. The following account of three\r\nfamilies will give a fair idea of their budget for part of the year at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nFamily No. 1 consists of five adults (over 14) and one child. They live\r\nin a two-roomed cabin and own one mule, two horses two cows. Their\r\naccount with the landlord for the years 1900 and 1901 was:\r\n\r\n                                   1900.\r\n  To balance 1899                $ 32.60\r\n  Cash ($25.00) for mule           36.00\r\n  Clothing                         19.68\r\n  Feed                             15.20\r\n  Provisions                       23.00\r\n  Tools                             2.03\r\n  Interest and Recording Fee       16.87\r\n                                 -------\r\n                                 $145.38\r\n\r\n                                   1901.\r\n  To balance 1900                $ 15.21\r\n  Cash                             26.57\r\n  Clothing                          9.55\r\n  Feed and seed                    44.19\r\n  Provisions                       26.29\r\n  Tools                              .55\r\n  Interest and Recording Fee       16.34\r\n                                 -------\r\n                                 $138.70\r\n\r\nTheir credit for 1901 was $10392, thus leaving a deficit for the\r\nbeginning of the next year. As the advances stop in August or September,\r\nand the balance of the purchases are for cash and may be at other\r\nstores, there is no way of getting at them. In 1900 the family paid $201\r\ntoward the 85 acres they are purchasing, part of this sum probably\r\ncoming from the crop of 1899, and in 1901 they made a further payment of\r\n$34. This family is doing much better than the average. It may be\r\ninteresting to see a copy of his account for the year 1901 taken from\r\nthe ledger of the planter.\r\n\r\n  Jan.  1.

They live in\r\na board cabin of two rooms, have one mule, one cow and one horse. They\r\nare purchasing 50 acres of land. Their accounts for 1900 and 1901 stand\r\nbetween the two already given.\r\n\r\n                                   1900.\r\n  Balance 1899                    $17.24\r\n  Cash                             23.20\r\n  Clothing                          4.73\r\n  Provisions                       19.80\r\n  Tools                             4.40\r\n  Interest and fee                  8.04\r\n                                  ------\r\n                                  $77.41\r\n\r\n                                   1901.\r\n  Balance 1900                    $13.93\r\n  Cash                             21.28\r\n  Clothing                          6.30\r\n  Feed                             26.50\r\n  Provisions                       21.36\r\n  Tools                             3.50\r\n  Interest and fee                 12.40\r\n                                 -------\r\n                                 $109.28\r\n\r\nBy November 30, 1901, they had paid $79.13 of their account. In 1900\r\nthey paid $180 towards their land and $29.60 in 1901.\r\n\r\nAll of these families are a little above the average. The income is\r\nsupplemented by the sale of chickens, eggs and occasionally butter. In\r\nhard years when the crops are poor the men and older boys seek service\r\nin the mines of North Alabama or on the railroads during the summer\r\nbefore cotton picking begins, and again during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe outfit of the average farmer is very inexpensive and is somewhat as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Harness, $1.50; pony plow, $3.00; extra point, 25c      $4.75\r\n\r\n  Sweepstock (a), 75c; 3 sweeps, 90c; scooter (b), 10c     1.75\r\n\r\n  2 hoes, 80c; blacksmith (yearly average), 50c            1.30\r\n                                                          -----\r\n    Total                                                 $7.80\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) A sweep is a form of cultivator used in cleaning grass and weeds from\r\nthe rows of cotton.\r\n\r\n(b) A scooter or \"bull-tongue\" is a strip of iron used in opening the\r\nfurrow for the cotton seed.\r\n\r\nA cow costs $25, pigs $2 to $2.50, wagon (seldom owned) $45. A mule now\r\ncosts from $100 to $150, but may be rented by the year for $20 or $25.\r\nOwners claim there is no profit in letting them at this price and the\r\nNegroes assert that if one dies the owner often claims that it had been\r\nsold and proceeds to collect the value thereof. From either point of\r\nview the plan seems to meet with but little favor.\r\n\r\nThe following table will give some idea of the condition and personal\r\nproperty of a number of families in Lowndes County:\r\n\r\n  ----------+----+----+----+----+----+---+-----+---+---+----+---+----+\r\n            |  A |  B |  C |  D |  E | F |  G  | H | I |  J | K |  L |\r\n  ----------+----+----+----+----+----+---+-----+---+---+----+---+----+\r\n  Family  1 |  4 |  1 |  2 |  0 |  2 | 0 |[9]0 | 0 | 0 |  2 | 0 |  2 |\r\n    \"     2 |  2 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 | 0 |   2 | 0 | 0 |  2 | 0 |  1 |\r\n    \"     3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  0 |  3 | 1 |   1 | 0 | 0 |  2 | 0 |  1 |\r\n    \"     4 |  2 |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 | 0 |   1 | 1 | 0 |  1 | 0 |  1 |\r\n    \"     5 |  4 |  2 |  1 |  1 |  2 | 0 |   0 | 2 | 0 |  1 | 2 |  1 |\r\n    \"     6 |  5 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  2 | 0 |   1 | 2 | 0 |  2 | 0 |  0 |\r\n    \"     7 |  3 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  3 | 0 |   1 | 0 | 0 |  2 | 0 |  1 |\r\n    \"     8 |  3 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  2 | 0 |   1 | 0 | 0 |  0 | 0 |  1 |\r\n    \"     9 |  4 |  0 |  0 |  3 |  5 | 0 |   0 | 1 | 1 |  0 | 0 |  1 |\r\n    \"    10 |  5 |  4 |  1 |  1 |  3 | 0 |   1 | 0 | 0 |  2 | 0 |  1 |\r\n  ----------+----+----+----+----+----+---+-----+---+---+----+---+----+\r\n         10 | 35 | 16 | 11 |  8 | 25 | 1 |   8 | 6 | 1 | 14 | 2 | 10 |\r\n  ----------+----+----+----+----+----+---+-----+---+---+----+---+----+\r\n\r\n     Key to columns:\r\n\r\n     A   Adults\r\n     B   Children under 14\r\n     C   Log Cabins\r\n     D   B'd Cabins\r\n     E   No. Rooms\r\n     F   Sewing Machines\r\n     G   Mules\r\n     H   Horses\r\n     I   Oxen\r\n     J   Cows\r\n     K   Pigs\r\n     L   Dogs\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the number of oxen is small. I should not be\r\nsurprised if some of the hogs escaped observation.\r\n\r\nAn account of this district would not be complete without reference to\r\nthe herb doctors who do a thriving business, charging from twenty-five\r\ncents per visit up. They make all sorts of noxious compounds which are\r\nretailed as good for various ailments. The medicines are perhaps no more\r\nharmful than the patent compounds of other places. There are also witch\r\ndoctors, of whom the Negroes stand in great awe and many a poor sufferer\r\nhas died because it was believed that he or she was bewitched by some\r\nevil person, hence physicians could have no power.\r\n\r\nThe budgets given indicate, and this is my own belief, that the farmers\r\nin this district are just about holding their own. They are not trained\r\nto take advantage of their environment to the full so they do not\r\nprosper as they might, while occasional designing persons take great\r\nadvantage of them, thereby rendering them discouraged. The introduction\r\nof a more diversified farming, the greater utilization of local\r\nresources in fruits and vegetables, thereby giving variety in the diet,\r\nthe development of pastures and stock raising would enable them to break\r\naway from the mortgage system, which retards them in many ways.\r\n\r\nThis view that the farmers here are about able to make a living is\r\nsupported by the investigations of Professor Du Bois.[10] He gives the\r\nfollowing report of 271 families in Georgia:\r\n\r\n  Year, 1898. Price of cotton low.\r\n    Bankrupt and sold out           3\r\n    $100 or over in debt           61\r\n    $25 to $100 in debt            54\r\n    $1 to $25 in debt              47\r\n    Cleared nothing                53\r\n    Cleared $1 to $25              27\r\n    Cleared $25 to $100            21\r\n    Cleared $100 and over           5\r\n                                 ----\r\n                                  271\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the general situation he says: \"A good season with good prices\r\nregularly sent a number out of debt and made them peasant proprietors; a\r\nbad season, either in weather or prices, still means the ruin of a\r\nthousand black homes.\" Under existing conditions the outlook does not\r\nseem to me especially hopeful.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLUVIAL DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n=A DOUBLE CABIN IN THE DELTA.=\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi river, deflected westward by the hills of Tennessee, at\r\nMemphis sweeps in a long arc to the hills at Natchez. The oval between\r\nthe river and the hills to the East is known as the \"Delta.\" The land is\r\nvery flat, being higher on the border of the river so that when the\r\nriver overflows the entire bottom land is flooded. The waters are not\r\nrestrained by a good system of levees and the danger of floods is\r\nreduced. There are similar areas in Arkansas and Louisiana and along the\r\nlower courses of the Red and other rivers, but what is said here will\r\nhave special reference to Mississippi conditions. The land is extremely\r\nfertile, probably there is none better in the world, and is covered with\r\na dense growth of fine woods, oak, ash, gum and cypress. The early\r\nsettlements, as already stated, were along the navigable streams, but\r\nthe great development of railroads is opening up the entire district.\r\nThe country may still be called new and thousands of acres may be\r\npurchased at a cost of less than $10 per acre, wild land, of course.\r\nCultivated land brings from $25 up.\r\n\r\nConsidering its possibilities the region is not yet densely populated,\r\nbut a line of immigration is setting in and the indications are that the\r\nDelta will soon be the seat of the heaviest Negro population in the\r\ncountry. Already it rivals the black prairie of Alabama. There have been\r\nmany influences to retard immigration, the fear of fevers, malaria and\r\ntyphoid, commonly associated with low countries, and the dread of\r\noverflows. Because of the lack of the labor force to develop the country\r\nplanters have been led to offer higher wages, better houses, etc. There\r\nis about the farming district an air of prosperity which is not\r\nnoticeable to the East. The country is particularly adapted to cotton,\r\nthe yield is heavier, about a bale to the acre if well cultivated,\r\nthough the average is a little less, the staple is longer, and the price\r\nis about a cent a pound higher, than in the hills. Fertilizers are\r\nseldom used and are not carried in the stores. Some of the lands which\r\nhave been longest in use have been harmed by improper tillage, but the\r\ninjury may easily be repaired by intelligent management.\r\n\r\nIn the Delta the average size of the plantations is large, but the\r\namount of land under the care of the tenant is smaller than in other\r\nsections. About 20 acres is probably the average to one work animal. The\r\nsoil is heavier, requiring longer and more constant cultivation. For\r\nthis land a rental of from $6 to $8 per acre is paid, while plantations\r\nwill rent for a term of years at an acre. A good deal of new land is\r\nbrought in cultivation by offering it rent free to a Negro for three\r\nyears, the tenant agreeing to clear off the timber and bring the soil\r\nunder cultivation. On some plantations no interest is charged on goods\r\nadvanced by the Negro usually pays 25 per cent. for all money he\r\nborrows. The white planter has to pay at least 8 per cent and agree to\r\nsell his cotton through the factor of whom the money is obtained and pay\r\nhim a commission of 2.5 per cent. for handling the cotton.\r\n\r\nThe plantation accounts of three families follow for the year 1901. They\r\nlive in Washington County, Mississippi, in which the Negroes form 89 per\r\ncent. of the total population.\r\n\r\nThe first family consists of three adults and one child under 14. They\r\nown two mules, two cows, ten pigs and some chickens. They also have a\r\nwagon and the necessary farm implements.\r\n\r\nTheir expenses were enlarged, as were those of the other families, by an\r\nepidemic of smallpox.\r\n\r\n                        Debit.

Now they have two mules, keep some pigs, own a\r\nwagon and farming tools. There are five adults in the family and two\r\nchildren. They live in a three-roomed cabin and till 30 acres of land,\r\nfour acres being wood land taken for clearing, for which there is no\r\nrent.\r\n\r\n                        Debit.

They are always behind, although\r\nthe wife is a good worker and the man is willing and seems to try. They\r\nare considered one of the poorest families on the plantation. There are\r\ntwo adults and one child. They own farming implements, one mule and some\r\npigs. They have a two-roomed cabin and farm 18 acres for which they pay\r\na crop rent of 1,800 pounds of cotton.\r\n\r\n                     Debit.                        Credit.\r\n  Doctor            $ 24.45      Cotton            $498.57\r\n  Mule                33.00      Cotton seed         91.00\r\n  Clothing            53.40                        -------\r\n  Rations             60.00                        $589.57\r\n  Feed                11.25                         576.55\r\n  Rent               130.50                        -------\r\n  Extra labor        179.45        Balance         $ 13.02\r\n  Seed                11.90\r\n  Ginning             43.50\r\n  Cash down           53.50\r\n                    -------\r\n                    $576.55\r\n\r\n\r\nAn examination of the accounts reveals that there is a charge for extra\r\nlabor, which for the third family was very heavy. This results from the\r\nfact that the average family _could_, but _does not_ pick all the cotton\r\nit makes, so when it is seen that enough is on hand to pay all the bills\r\nand leave a balance it is very careless about the remainder. Planters\r\nhave great difficulty in getting all the cotton picked and a\r\nconsiderable portion is often lost. Extra labor must be imported. This\r\nis hard to get and forms, when obtained, a serious burden on the income\r\nof the tenant.\r\n\r\nOn the plantation from whose books the above records were taken the\r\nsystem of bookkeeping is more than usually careful and the gin account\r\nthus forms a separate item so that although all planters charge for the\r\nginning the charge does not always appear on the books.\r\n\r\nThese three families are believed to be average and indicate what it is\r\npossible for the typical family to do under ordinary conditions. It is\r\nbut fair to state that the owners of this plantation make many efforts\r\nto get their tenants to improve their condition and will not long keep\r\nthose whose accounts do not show a credit balance at the end of the\r\nyear. A copy of the lease in use will be of interest and its\r\nstipulations form quite a contrast to the one quoted from Alabama. The\r\ncash and share leases are identical save for necessary changes in form.\r\nThe names are fictitious.\r\n\r\n     \"This Contract, made this date and terminating December 31, 1902,\r\n     between Smith and Brown, and John Doe, hereinafter called tenant,\r\n     Witnesses: That Smith and Brown have this day rented and set apart\r\n     to John Doe for the year 1902 certain twenty acres of land on James\r\n     Plantation, Washington County, Mississippi, at a rental price per\r\n     acre of seven dollars and fifty cents.

They also agree to keep said house and pump in good\r\n     repair and to keep said land well ditched and drained.\r\n\r\n     Being desirous of having said tenant raise sufficient corn to\r\n     supply his needs during the ensuing year, in consideration of his\r\n     planting such land in corn as they may designate, they hereby agree\r\n     to purchase from said tenant all corn over and above such as may be\r\n     necessary for his needs, and to pay therefor the market price; and\r\n     to purchase all corn raised by him in the event be wishes to remove\r\n     from James plantation at the termination of this contract. In\r\n     consideration of the above undertaking on Smith and Brown's part,\r\n     the said tenant hereby agrees to sell to them all surplus corn\r\n     raised by him and in the event of his leaving James' plantation at\r\n     the termination of this contract to sell to them all corn he may\r\n     have on hand: in each case at the market price.\r\n\r\n     The said Smith and Brown hereby reserve to themselves all liens\r\n     for rent and supplies on all cotton, cotton seed, corn and other\r\n     agricultural products, grown upon said land during the year 1902,\r\n     granted under Sections 2495 and 2496 of the Code of 1892. They\r\n     hereby agree to handle and sell for the said tenant all cotton and\r\n     other crops raised by him for sale, to the best of their ability,\r\n     and to account to him for the proceeds of the same when sold. They\r\n     also reserve to themselves the right to at all times exercise such\r\n     supervision as they may deem necessary over the planting and\r\n     cultivating of all crops to be raised by him during the year 1902.\r\n\r\n     The said John Doe hereby rents from Smith and Brown the above\r\n     mentioned land for the year 1902 and promises to pay therefor seven\r\n     dollars and a half per acre on or before November the first, 1902,\r\n     and hereby agrees to all the terms and stipulations herein\r\n     mentioned.\r\n\r\n     He furthermore represents to Smith and Brown that he has sufficient\r\n     force to properly plant and cultivate same, and agrees that if at\r\n     any time in their judgment his crops may be in need of cultivation,\r\n     they may have the necessary work done and charge same to his\r\n     account.\r\n\r\n     He furthermore agrees to at all times properly control his family\r\n     and hands, both as to work and conduct, and obligates himself to\r\n     prevent any one of them from causing any trouble whatsoever, either\r\n     to his neighbors or to Smith and Brown.\r\n\r\n     He also agrees to plant and cultivate all land allotted to him,\r\n     including the edges of the roads, turn rows, and ditch banks, and\r\n     to keep the latter at all times clean and to plant no garden or\r\n     truck patches in his field.\r\n\r\n     He also agrees to gather and deliver all agricultural products\r\n     which he may raise for sale to said Smith and Brown, as they may\r\n     designate to be handled and sold by them, for his account.\r\n\r\n     He also agrees not to abandon, neglect, turn back or leave his\r\n     crops or any part of them, nor to allow his family or hands to do\r\n     so, until entirely gathered and delivered.\r\n\r\n     In order that Smith and Brown may be advised of the number of\r\n     tenants which they may have to secure for the ensuing year, in\r\n     ample time to enable them to provide for the same, the said tenant\r\n     hereby agrees to notify them positively by December 10, 1902,\r\n     whether or not he desires to remain on James' Plantation for the\r\n     ensuing year. Should he not desire to remain, then he agrees to\r\n     deliver to Smith and Brown possession of the house now allotted to\r\n     him by January 1st, 1903. In order that said tenant may have ample\r\n     time in which to provide for himself a place for the ensuing year,\r\n     Smith and Brown hereby agree to notify him by December 10, 1902,\r\n     should they not want him as a tenant during the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n     Witness our signatures, this the 15th day of December, 1901.\r\n\r\n                                                      SMITH AND BROWN.\r\n                                                      JOHN DOE.\r\n\r\n     Witness: J. W. JAMES.\r\n\r\nThe owners have been unable to carry out their efforts in full, but the\r\nresult has been very creditable. The lease is much preferable to the one\r\ngiven on page 46.\r\n\r\nIf, as I believe, the families above reported are average and are living\r\nunder ordinary conditions, it seems evident that a considerable surplus\r\nresults from their labors each year. I wish I could add that the money\r\nwere being either wisely spent or saved and invested. This does not seem\r\nto be the case and it is generally stated that the amount of money\r\nwasted in the fall of the year by the blacks of the Delta is enormous.\r\nIn the cabins the great catalogs of the mail order houses of Montgomery\r\nWard & Co., and Sears, Roebuck & Co., of Chicago are often found, and\r\nthe express agents say that large shipments of goods are made to the\r\nNegroes. Patent medicines form no inconsiderable proportion of these\r\npurchases, while \"Stutson\" hats, as the Negro says, are required by the\r\nyoung bloods. The general improvidence of the people is well illustrated\r\nby the following story related by a friend of the writer. At the close\r\nof one season an old Negro woman came to his wife for advice as to the\r\nuse to be made of her savings, some $125. She was advised to buy some\r\nhousehold necessities and to put the remainder in a bank, above all she\r\nwas cautioned to beware of any who sought to get her to squander the\r\nmoney. The woman left but in about two weeks' time returned to borrow\r\nsome money. It developed that as she went down the street a Jewess\r\ninvited her to come in and have a cup of coffee. The invitation was\r\naccepted and during the conversation she was advised to spend the money.\r\nThis she did, and when the transactions were over the woman had one\r\nbarrel of flour, one hundred pounds of meat, ten dollars or so worth of\r\ncheap jewelry, some candy and other incidentals and no money. Foolish\r\nexpenditures alone, according to the belief of the planters, prevent the\r\nNegroes from owning the entire land in a generation. I would not give\r\nthe impression that there are no Negro land owners in this region.\r\nThousands of acres have been purchased and are held by them, but we are\r\nspeaking of average families.\r\n\r\nSome curious customs prevail. The planters generally pay the Negroes in\r\ncash for their cotton seed and this money the blacks consider as\r\nsomething peculiarly theirs, not to be used for any debts they may have.\r\nAlthough the prices for goods advanced are higher than cash prices, the\r\nNegroes will often, when spring comes, insist that they be advanced, so\r\nhave the goods charged even at the higher prices, even though they have\r\nthe cash on hand. This great over-appreciation of present goods is a\r\ndrawback to their progress.\r\n\r\nIn this district I found little dissatisfaction among the Negro farmers.\r\nThey felt that their opportunities were good. Those who come from the\r\nhills can scarce believe their eyes at the crops produced and constantly\r\nask when the cotton plants are going to turn yellow and droop. That\r\nthere is little migration back to the hills is good evidence of the\r\nrelative standing of the two districts in their eyes.\r\n\r\nWages for day labor range from 60 to 75 cents, but the extra labor\r\nimported for cotton picking makes over double this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUGAR REGION.\r\n\r\nSouth of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the alluvial district is largely given\r\nover to the growing of sugar cane with occasional fields of rice. The\r\ndistrict under cultivation stretches back from the river a couple of\r\nmiles or so to the edge of the woods beyond which at present there is no\r\ntillable ground, though drainage will gradually push back the line of\r\nthe forest. These sugar lands are valued highly, $100 or so an acre, and\r\nthe capital invested in the great sugar houses is enormous. Probably\r\nnowhere in agricultural pursuits is there a more thorough system of\r\nbookkeeping than on these plantations. This land is cultivated by hired\r\nhands, who work immediately under the eye of overseers. Nowhere is the\r\nland let out in small lots to tenants. Conditions are radically\r\ndifferent from those prevailing in the cotton regions. The work season,\r\nit is claimed, begins on the first day of January and ends on the 31st\r\nof December, and every day between when the weather permits work in the\r\nfields there is work to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CABINS ON SUGAR PLANTATION.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThese plantations present an attractive appearance. The cabins are not\r\nscattered as in the cotton country, but are usually ranged on either\r\nside of a broad street, with rows of trees in front. The cabins are\r\noften for two families and each has a plot of ground for a garden. The\r\nplanters say the Negroes will not live in the houses unless the garden\r\nplots are provided, even if they make no use of them. To each family is\r\nallotted a house so long as they are employed on the place. Wood is free\r\nand teams are provided for hauling it from the forest. Free pasture for\r\nstock is often provided.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the men would seldom work more than five and a half\r\ndays a week arose the custom of paying off every eleven days. Each\r\nworkman has a time book and as soon as he has completed his eleven days\r\nhis pay is due. This avoids a general pay day and the demoralization\r\nthat would likely follow. Work is credited by quarters of a day: Sunrise\r\nto breakfast, breakfast to dinner, dinner to about 3:00 p. m., 3:00 p. m.\r\nto sunset. Wages vary according to the season, being much larger during\r\nautumn when the cane is being ground. For field work men get 70 cents\r\nper day, women 55 to 60 cents. During the grinding season the men earn\r\nfrom $1 to $1.25, the women about 85 cents, children from 25 cents up.\r\nWages are usually paid through a store which may or may not be under the\r\ndirect ownership of the plantation. All accounts against the store are\r\ndeducted, but the balance must be paid in cash if it is so desired.\r\nNominally the men are free to trade where they will, but it is easy to\r\nsee that pressure might be brought to bear to make it advantageous to\r\ntrade at the local store.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1901 two families were able to earn the following\r\namounts. The first family consists of three adults and two children, but\r\nthe wife did not work in the field.\r\n\r\n  $10.50  7.00 13.80 12.60 10.85 12.60 11.55\r\n   10.85  6.65 13.80 12.95 15.40 14.50 11.20\r\n    2.62  1.25                    2.25  4.35\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------\r\n  $23.97 14.90 27.60 25.55 26.25 29.35 27.10\r\n\r\n\r\n  11.55  8.40  9.80 20.60 25.75 28.75      Man\r\n  11.20  7.35  9.80  7.95 16.00 10.15      Son\r\n   4.35  3.05  1.20  6.40 18.15 15.75      Boy\r\n                     1.85 10.12  6.75      Boy\r\n  --------------------------------------------\r\n  27.10 18.80 20.80 36.80 70.02 61.40--$382.54\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the grinding season the men's wages were increased to $1 a day\r\nand the boys' to 40 cents and the father had chances to make extra time\r\nas nightwatchman, etc. This family own a horse and buggy, keep poultry\r\nand have a fair garden. They are rather thrifty and have money stowed\r\naway somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe second family consists of the parents and eight children. Their\r\nincome is fair, but they are always \"hard up.\" They spend their money\r\nextravagantly. The man is head teamster on the plantation and makes 80\r\ncents per day, which is increased to $1.30 during the grinding season.\r\nThe wife in this family also did no work save in the fall.\r\n\r\n  $16.00 14.40 17.60 15.40 18.40 16.80 17.80\r\n    7.87  6.85 10.10  9.25  9.65 10.10 11.00\r\n   12.60  8.75 12.60 13.30 15.55 14.50 11.90\r\n    2.90  1.50  4.50\r\n    1.25  1.80   .65\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------\r\n  $40.62 33.30 45.45 37.95 43.60 41.40 40.70\r\n\r\n\r\n   17.80 18.00 16.60 23.30  44.95  43.05   Man\r\n   11.00 10.25  4.00  6.00  19.30  18.00   Boy\r\n   11.90 12.40 11.70 19.25  25.75  23.00   Son\r\n                      6.75  17.25  14.75   Girl\r\n                                    1.60   Boy\r\n                      2.10   8.00   5.25   Boy\r\n                      3.00  15.15  13.50   Woman\r\n  ----------------------------------------------\r\n   40.70 40.65 32.30 60.40 130.30 119.15--665.82\r\n\r\n\r\nThese families are typical so far as known. In comparing their incomes\r\nwith those in other districts it must be borne in mind that they have no\r\nrent to pay and their only necessary expenses are for food and clothes\r\nand incidentals. Certainly both of the families should have money to\r\ntheir credit at the end of the year. The total wages depends not only on\r\nthe willingness to work, but also on weather conditions. One gets the\r\nimpression that in some places conditions are pretty bad and even by\r\nsome white residents of the state it is claimed that a state of\r\nservitude almost prevails on many plantations. In any case the Negroes\r\ndo not seem satisfied. The labor is rather heavy. For this or other\r\nreasons there has been quite an exodus to the cotton country in recent\r\nyears, which has caused the cane planters much trouble and they will\r\nmake many concessions to keep their tenants. To meet this emigration for\r\nsome time efforts have been made to import Italian labor but the results\r\nhave not been wholly satisfactory. The Italians are more reliable and\r\nthis is a great argument in their favor, but with this exception they\r\nare not considered much better workers than the blacks. The storekeepers\r\nmuch prefer the Negroes, who spend their money more freely.\r\n\r\nThe planters claim that the labor is unreliable and say they never know\r\non Saturday how many workers they will have on Monday. They also say it\r\nis hard to get extra labor done. In 1900 on one plantation the women\r\nwere offered ten cents a day extra for some hoeing, but only four held\r\nout. Higher wages were offered if some cane were cut by the ton instead\r\nof by the day, but after a week the hands asked to return to the gang at\r\nthe lower wage.\r\n\r\nIn the rice fields along the river about the same wages prevail as for\r\nthe field hands in the cane plantations. The rice crop, however, is but\r\na six months crop, so other employment must be found for part of the\r\nyear if nothing but rice is raised. It is usual in this region to raise\r\nrice as a side crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COUNTRY CHURCH AND SCHOOL.=\r\n\r\nHitherto we have had to do chiefly with the economic situation of the\r\nNegro farmer. There is, however, another set of forces which may not be\r\nignored if we are to understand the situation which confronts us. These\r\nare, of course, the social forces. In discussing these it is more than\r\never essential to remember that a differentiation has been taking place\r\namong the Negroes and that there are large numbers who are not to be\r\ngrouped with the average men and women whom we seek to describe. It may\r\neven be true that there are communities which have gained a higher\r\nlevel. Any statement of the social environment of 8,000,000 people must\r\nnecessarily be false if applied strictly to each individual. The\r\nexistence of the higher class must not, however, be allowed to blind us\r\nto the condition of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe average Negro boy or girl is allowed to grow. It is difficult to\r\nsay much more for the training received at home. We must remember that\r\nthere is an almost total absence of home life as we understand it. The\r\nfamily seldom sits down together at the table or do anything else in\r\ncommon. The domestic duties are easily mastered by the girls and chores\r\ndo not weigh heavily on the boys. At certain periods of the year the\r\nchildren are compelled to assist in the farm operations, such as picking\r\ncotton, but most of the time they are care free. Thus they run almost\r\nwild while the parents are at work in the fields, and the stranger who\r\nsuddenly approaches a cabin and beholds the youngsters scattering for\r\nshelter will not soon forget the sight. Obedience, neatness, punctuality\r\ndo not thrive in such an atmosphere. The introduction to the country\r\nschool a little later does not greatly improve conditions. The teachers\r\nare often incompetent and their election often depends upon other things\r\nthan fitness to teach; upon things, indeed, which are at times far from\r\ncomplimentary to the school trustees. The school year seldom exceeds\r\nfour months and this may be divided into two terms, two months in the\r\nfall and two in the spring. School opens at an indefinite time in the\r\nmorning, if scheduled for nine it is just as likely as not that it\r\nbegins at ten thirty, while the closing hour is equally uncertain. The\r\nindividual attention received by the average child is necessarily small.\r\nThe schools are poorly equipped with books or maps. The interior view\r\ngiven on page 61 is by no means exceptional.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to mention the fact that recognition of these\r\nevils is leading in many places in the South to the incorporation of\r\nprivate schools, which then offer their facilities to the public in\r\nreturn for partial support at the public expense. Public moneys are\r\nbeing turned over to these schools in considerable amounts. In some\r\ncounties the public does not own a school building. Without questioning\r\nthe fact that these schools are an improvement over existing conditions,\r\nhistory will belie itself if this subsidizing of private organizations\r\ndoes not some day prove a great drawback to the proper development of\r\nthe public school system, unless it may be, that the courts will declare\r\nthe practice illegal and unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe home and the school being from our point of view unsatisfactory, the\r\nnext social institution to which we turn is the church. Since the war\r\nthis has come to be the most influential in the opinion of the Negro and\r\nit deserves more careful study than has yet been given to it. Only some\r\nof the more obvious features can here be considered. The first thing to\r\nimpress the observer is the fact that time is again no object to the\r\nNegro. The service advertised for eleven may get fairly under way by\r\ntwelve and there is no predicting when it will stop. The people drift in\r\nand out, one or two at a time, throughout the service. Families do not\r\nenter nor sit together. Outside is always a group talking over matters\r\nof general interest. The music, lined out, consists of the regulation\r\nchurch hymns, which are usually screeched all out of time in a high key.\r\nThe contrast between this music and the singing of the plantation songs\r\nat Hampton or some other schools which impresses one as does little\r\nmusic he hears elsewhere is striking. The people have the idea that\r\nplantation songs are out of place in the church. The collection is taken\r\nwith a view to letting others know what each one does. At the proper\r\ntime a couple of the men take their places at a table before the pulpit\r\nand invite the people to come forward with their offerings. The people\r\nstraggle up the aisle with their gifts, being constantly urged to hasten\r\nso as not to delay the service. After half an hour or so the results\r\nobtained are remarkable and the social emulation redounds to the benefit\r\nof the preacher. It is difficult for the white visitor to get anything\r\nbut hints of the real possibilities of the preacher, for he is at once\r\nintroduced to the audience and induced to address them if it is\r\npossible. Even when this is not done there is usually an air of\r\nrestraint which is noticeable. Only occasionally does the speaker forget\r\nhimself and break loose, as it were. The study then presented is\r\ninteresting in the extreme. While the minister shouts, the audience are\r\nswaying backward and forward in sympathetic rhythm, encouraging the\r\nspeaker with cries of \"Amen\", \"That's right\", \"That's the Gospel\", \"Give\r\nit to 'em bud\", \"Give 'em a little long sweetening\". There is no\r\nquestion that they are profoundly moved, but the identity of the spirit\r\nwhich troubles the waters is to me sometimes a question. The forms of\r\nthe white man's religion have been adopted, but the content of these\r\nforms seems strangely different. Seemingly the church, or rather,\r\nreligion, is not closely identified with morality. I am sorry to say\r\nthat in the opinion of the best of both races the average country (and\r\ncity) pastor does not bear a good reputation, the estimates of the\r\nimmoral running from 50 to 98 per cent. of the total number. It is far\r\nfrom me to discount any class of people, but if the situation is\r\nanything as represented by the estimate, the seriousness of it is\r\nevident. This idea is supported by the fact that indulgence in\r\nimmorality is seldom a bar to active church membership, and if a member\r\nbe dismissed from one communion there are others anxious to receive him\r\nor her. There are churches and communities of which these statements are\r\nnot true. It is interesting to note that the churches are securing their\r\nchief support from the women. As an organization the church does not\r\nseem to have taken any great interest in the matters which most vitally\r\naffect the life of the people, except to be a social center. If these\r\nthings be considered it is easy to see why the best informed are seeking\r\nfor the country districts men who can be leaders of the people during\r\nthe week on the farms as well as good speakers on Sunday. It is a\r\npleasure to note that here and there some busy pastor is also spending a\r\ngood deal of his time cultivating a garden, or running a small farm,\r\nwith the distinct purpose of setting a good example. The precise way in\r\nwhich the church may be led to exert a wider and more helpful influence\r\non the people is a matter of great importance, but it must be solved\r\nfrom within.\r\n\r\nTurning from religious work we find the church bearing an important\r\nplace in the social life and amusements. Besides its many gatherings and\r\nprotracted meetings which are social functions, numbers of picnics and\r\nexcursions are given. These may be on the railroads to rather distant\r\npoints, and because of the lack of discrimination as to participants,\r\nmany earnest protests have been filed by the better class of Negroes.\r\nThe amusements of the blacks are simple. Nearly all drink, but\r\ndrunkenness is not a great vice. Dances are in high esteem, and are\r\noften accompanied by much drinking and not infrequently by cutting\r\nscrapes, for the Negro's passions lie on the surface and are easily\r\naroused. In South Carolina the general belief seems to be that the\r\ndispensary law has been beneficial. There is also a universal fondness\r\nfor tobacco in all its forms. Gambling prevails wherever there is ready\r\nmoney and not infrequently leads to serious assaults. Music has great\r\ncharms while a circus needs not the excuse of children to justify it in\r\nthe Negro's eyes. Some of the holidays are celebrated, and when on the\r\ncoast the blacks dubbed the 30th of May \"Desecration Day,\" there were\r\nthose who thought it well named. Active sports, with the occasional\r\nexception of a ball game, are not preferred to the more quiet pleasure\r\nof sitting about in the sunshine conversing with friends. America can\r\nnot show a happier, more contented lot of people than these same blacks.\r\n\r\nIf we turn our attention to other characteristics of the Negro we must\r\nnotice his different moral standard. To introduce the little I shall say\r\non this point let me quote from a well known anthropologist. \"There is\r\nnothing more difficult for us to realize, civilized as we are, than the\r\nmental state of the man far behind us in cultivation, as regards what we\r\ncall par excellence 'morality.' It is not indecency; it is simply an\r\nanimal absence of modesty. Acts which are undeniably quite natural,\r\nsince they are the expression of a primordial need, essential to the\r\nduration of the species, but which a long ancestral and individual\r\neducation has trained us to subject to a rigorous restraint, and to the\r\naccomplishment of which, consequently, we can not help attaching a\r\ncertain shame, do not in the least shock the still imperfect conscience\r\nof the primitive man.\" From somewhat this standpoint we must judge of\r\nthe Negro. Two or three illustrations will suffice. Talking last summer\r\nto a porter in a small hotel, I asked him if he had ever lived on a\r\nfarm. He replied that he had and that he often thought of returning.\r\nAsking him why he did not he said that it would be necessary for him to\r\nget a wife and a lot of other things. I suggested the possibility of\r\nboarding in another family. He shook his head and said: \"Niggers is\r\nqueer folks, boss. 'Pears to me they don' know what they gwine do. Ef I\r\ngo out and live in a man's house like as not I run away wid dat man's\r\nwife.\" The second illustration is taken from an unpublished manuscript\r\nby Rev. J. L. Tucker of Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\n     There is a negro of good character here in Baton Rouge whose name\r\n     is ---- ----. He is a whitewasher by trade and does mainly odd jobs\r\n     for the white people who are his patrons, and earns a good living.\r\n     He is widely known through the city as a good and reliable man.\r\n     Some time ago he had trouble with his wife's preacher, who came to\r\n     his house too often. The trouble culminated in his wife leaving\r\n     him. Soon thereafter he sent or went into the country and brought\r\n     home a negro woman whom he installed in his house to cook and\r\n     otherwise serve him. Explaining the circumstances to Mr. ----, he\r\n     said: \"I a'in' got no use for nigga preachers. Dey is de debbil wid\r\n     de wimmen. I tol' dat ar fellah to keep away fr'm my house or I'd\r\n     hunt him wid a shotgun, an' I meant it. But he got her'n spite a\r\n     me. She went off to 'im. Now I's got me a wife from way back in de\r\n     country, who don' know the ways of nigga preachers. I kin keep her,\r\n     I reckon, a while, anyway. I pays her wages reg'lar, an' she does\r\n     her duty by me. I tell yeh, Mr. ----, a hired wife's a heap\r\n     better's a married wife any time, yeh mark dat. Ef yeh don' line er\r\n     yer can sen' her off an' get anudder, an' she's nutten to complain\r\n     'bout a' longs yeh pay her wages. Yes siree, yeh put dat down; de\r\n     hired wife's nuff sight better'n de married one. I don' fus no mo'\r\n     wid marryin' wives, I hires 'em. An I sent word to dat preacher dat\r\n     if he comes roun' my house now I lays for 'im shore wid buck shot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCommenting, Mr. Tucker says that the man had no idea of moral wrong, the\r\nreal wife has lost no caste, the preacher stands just as well with his\r\nflock and the \"new wife\" is well received. The third instance occurred\r\non a plantation. A married woman, not satisfied with the shoes she\r\nreceived from the store, wanted a pair of yellow turned shoes. The\r\nplanter would not supply them. The woman was angry and finally left her\r\nhusband, went to a neighboring place and \"took up\" with another man.\r\n\r\nThese cases sufficiently illustrate prevailing conceptions of the\r\nsacredness of the marriage tie. Certainly this involves a theory of home\r\nlife which differs from ours. Many matings are consummated without any\r\nregular marriage ceremony and with little reference to legal\r\nrequirements, and divorces are equally informal. Moral lapses seldom\r\nbring the Negro before the courts. All these things but indicate the\r\nhandicap which has to be overcome. Within the family there is often\r\ngreat abuse on the part of the men. The result of it all is that many\r\nNegroes do not know their own fathers and so little are the ties of\r\nkinship' regarded that near relatives are often unknown, and if possible\r\nless cared for. This may be substantiated by the records of any charity\r\nsociety in the North which has sought to trace friends of its Negro\r\napplicants. To attempt a quantitative estimate of the extent of sexual\r\nimmorality is useless. It is sufficient to realize that a different\r\nstandard prevails and one result today is a frightful prevalence of\r\nvenereal diseases to which any practising physician in the South can\r\nbear witness. I am glad to say there are sections which have risen above\r\nthese conditions.\r\n\r\nThe transition from slavery to freedom set in operation the forces of\r\nnatural selection, which are sure and steadily working among the people\r\nand are weeding out those who for any reason can not adapt themselves to\r\nthe new environment. Insanity, almost unknown in slavery times, has\r\nappeared and has been increasing among the Negroes of the South at a\r\nrate of about 100 per cent. a decade since 1860. Of course, the number\r\naffected is still small, but the end is perhaps not reached. We have\r\nwitnessed also the development of the pauper and criminal classes. This\r\nwas to be expected. There is also some evidence of an increase in the\r\nuse of drugs, cocaine and the like. The point to be noted is that there\r\nis taking place a steady division of the Negroes into various social\r\nstrata and in spite of race traits it is no longer to be considered as\r\non a level.\r\n\r\nI have sought to represent the situation as it appears to me, neither\r\nseeking to overemphasize the virtues or the vices of the race. It is\r\nclear to me that in spite of the obvious progress the road ahead is long\r\nand hard. While I do not anticipate any such acceleration of speed as\r\nwill immediately bring about an economic or social millenium I believe\r\nthat proper measures may be found, indeed, are already in use, which if\r\nwidely adopted will lead to better things. How many of the race will\r\nfall by the way is, in one sense, a matter of indifference. In the long\r\nrun, for the whites as well as the blacks, they will survive who adapt\r\ntheir social theories and, consequently, their modes of life to their\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE OUTLOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One of the things which militates most against the Negro here is his\r\nunreliability. * * * His mental processes are past finding out and he\r\ncan not be counted on to do or not to do a given thing under given\r\ncircumstances. There is scarcely a planter in all this territory who\r\nwould not make substantial concessions for an assured tenantry.\" A\r\nNorthern man, now resident in the South and employing Negro labor, says:\r\n\"I am convinced of one thing and that is that there is no dependence to\r\nbe placed in 90 per cent. of the Negro laborers if left to themselves\r\nand out of the overseer's sight.\" These quotations from men who are\r\nseeking to promote the success of the Negroes with whom they come in\r\ncontact might be multiplied indefinitely from every part of the South.\r\nThe statements are scarce open to discussion, so well recognized is the\r\nfact. If I have rightly apprehended the nature of the training afforded\r\nby Africa and slavery there was little in them to develop the habits of\r\nforethought, thrift and industry, upon which this reliability must be\r\nbased.\r\n\r\nI am not arguing the question as to whether this unreliability marks a\r\ndecadence of Negro standards or whether it is due to the present higher\r\nstandards of the white. For argument, at least, I am willing to admit\r\nthat in quality of workmanship, in steadfastness and self-control there\r\nhas really been great progress. My interest is in the present and future\r\nrather than the past. I have tried to show that, judged by present\r\nstandards, the Negro is still decidedly lacking. Personally I am not\r\nsurprised at this. I should be astonished if it were otherwise. The\r\ntrouble is that we at the North are unable to disabuse ourselves of the\r\nidea that the Negro is a dark skinned Yankee and we think, therefore,\r\nthat if all is not as it should be that something is wrong, that\r\nsomebody or some social condition is holding him back. We accuse\r\nslavery, attribute it to the hostility of the Southern white. Something\r\n_is holding him back_, but it is his inheritance of thousands of years\r\nin Africa, not slavery nor the Southern whites. It is my observation\r\nthat the white of the black belt deal with the Negro more patiently and\r\nendure far more of shiftless methods than the average Northerner would\r\ntolerate for a day. It is interesting to note that Northern white women\r\nwho go South filled with the idea that the Negro is abused can scarce\r\nkeep a servant the first year or so of their stay. Of course there are\r\nexceptions, few in number, who say as did a lumberman in Alabama last\r\nsummer: \"I never have any trouble with the Negro. Have worked them for\r\ntwenty years. Why, I haven't had to kill one yet, though I did shoot one\r\nonce, but I used fine shot and it didn't hurt him much.\" We have\r\nattempted to have the Negro do in a few years what it has taken us\r\nthousands to accomplish, and are surprised that he has disappointed us.\r\nThere is no room for discouragement. Contrast the Negro in Africa and\r\nAmerica to see what has been done.\r\n\r\nUnless this unreliability is overcome it will form even a greater\r\nhandicap for the future. Southern methods of agriculture have been more\r\nwasteful of small economies than have Northern. That a change is\r\nimperative, in many districts at least, has been shown. Is the Negro in\r\na position to take advantage of these changes? At present it must be\r\nadmitted that he does not possess the knowledge to enable him to utilize\r\nhis environment and make the most out of it. It has been shown that he\r\nis bearing little part in the development of the trucking industry, nay\r\nmore, that he does not even raise enough garden truck for his own\r\nsupport. In a bulletin of the Farmer's Improvement Society of Texas I\r\nfind the following:\r\n\r\n     Very many, in the first place, do not try to make their supplies at\r\n     home. Very often much is lost by bad fences. Lots of them don't know\r\n     where their hoes, plows, single-trees, etc., are at this minute. Lots\r\n     of them buy butter, peas, beans, lard, meat and hay. * * * Well,\r\n     really, to sum up, if there's anything like scientific methods among\r\n     the vast majority of our people I don't know it. * * * I venture to\r\n     say that not one negro farmer in a hundred ever saw the back of one\r\n     of these bulletins (agricultural), much less the inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf some of these primary lessons have not been mastered what chance is\r\nthere that the Negro will overcome, unaided, the crop lien system and\r\nhis other handicaps and introduce diversified agriculture, stock\r\nraising, etc.? Slavery taught him something about work and he is willing\r\nto work, and work hard, under leadership. Herein lies the possibility of\r\nhis economic salvation. He is not yet ready as a race to stand alone and\r\nadvance at the pace demanded by America of the twentieth century. He\r\nmust be taught and the teaching must be by practice as well as by\r\nprecept. Viewed from this standpoint, though it is equally true from\r\nanother, one of the great needs of the South is that its white farmers\r\nshould pay more attention to other things than cotton. So long as land\r\nis considered too valuable to use for pasture, for hay, for the various\r\ncrops on which stock live and fatten, or so long as it is considered\r\nprofitable to sell cotton seed for $5 a ton and throw away four or five\r\ntimes this amount in the food and manure which the same seed contains,\r\nthe Negro will not see the advantage of a different system. Nor does the\r\nsight of thousands of tons of rice straw dumped into the Mississippi\r\neach year, just as a generation ago the oat straw in Iowa was burned,\r\nlead him to suspect unused sources of wealth. The possibilities of\r\nSouthern agriculture are great, but the lead must be taken by the\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\nThe Negro has a great advantage over the Italian or other European\r\npeasant in that the white man prefers him as a helper. He is patient,\r\ndocile and proud of his work. He is wanted by the native whites, and if\r\nthe reader doubts this let him go to any Southern community and attempt\r\nto bring about any great exodus of the Negroes and he will be surprised\r\nto find how soon he is requested to move on. This interest on the part\r\nof the whites is a factor which must be considered. It would be a happy\r\nday for the Negro if the white woman of the South took her old personal\r\ninterest in his welfare. This friendly sentiment will not increase with\r\ntime and each succeeding generation will emphasize, more and more,\r\nindustrial efficiency, and the Negro will not be preferred.\r\nCorresponding to this is the fact that the Negro respects and willingly\r\nfollows the white man, more willingly and more trustingly than he does\r\nanother Negro. He is personally loyal, as the care received by the\r\nsoldiers during war time illustrated. But slavery is gone and the\r\nfeudalism which followed it is slowly yielding to commercialism, which\r\ngives the palm to the more efficient.\r\n\r\nHitherto the Negro has tilled much of the best land of the South.\r\nMeantime the great prairies have been settled and about all the good\r\ncheap land of the northwest taken. A tide of immigration is setting in\r\ntowards the Southern states. Already the rice industry of Louisiana has\r\nbeen revolutionized by white immigrants. What may this mean for the\r\nNegro if these incoming whites defy race prejudice and seek the rich\r\nbottom lands of the Mississippi or elsewhere? Will the Negro be in a\r\nposition of independence or will he only assist the white? Will he till\r\nin the future the best lands or will he be forced to the less fertile?\r\nWith the knowledge of the present regarding yellow fever, malaria and\r\ntyphoid the dread of the lowlands is disappearing. If the indications\r\npoint, as many believe, towards the South as the seat of the next great\r\nagricultural development these questions become of vital importance to\r\nthe Negro. Can he become economically secure before he is made to meet a\r\ncompetition which he has never yet faced? Or does the warmer climate\r\ngive him an advantage, which the whites can not overcome? I must confess\r\nthat I doubt it. In \"The Cotton Plant\" (page 242), Mr. Harry Hammond\r\nstates that in 39 counties of the Black Prairie Region of Texas, in\r\nwhich the whites predominate, the average value of the land is $12.19\r\nper acre, as against $6.40 for similar soil in twelve counties of the\r\nBlack Prairie of Alabama, in which the Negroes are in the majority. He\r\nsays further: \"The number and variety of implements recently introduced\r\nin cotton culture here, especially in the prairies of Texas, is very\r\nmuch greater than elsewhere in the cotton belt.\" This would indicate\r\nthat heat alone is no insurmountable obstacle.\r\n\r\nIf these things be true, then as the late Mr. J. L. M. Curry said:\r\n\r\n     \"It may be assumed that the industrial problem lies at the heart of\r\n     the whole situation which confronts us. Into our public and other\r\n     schools should be incorporated industrial training. If to\r\n     regularity, punctuality, silence, obedience to authority, there be\r\n     systematically added instruction in mechanical arts, the results\r\n     would be astounding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of classical education does not now concern us. The\r\nabsolutely essential thing is that the Negro shall learn to work\r\nregularly and intelligently. The lesson begun in slavery must be\r\nmastered. As Dr. E. G. Murphy puts it:\r\n\r\n     The industrial training supplied by that school (slavery) is now\r\n     denied to him. The capacity, the equipment, and the necessity for\r\n     work which slavery provided are the direct cause of the superiority\r\n     of the old time darkey. Is freedom to have no substitute for the\r\n     ancient school? * * * The demand of the situation is not less\r\n     education, but more education of the right sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would not say that I thought all Negroes should be farmers, but I do\r\nfeel that the farm offers the mass of the race the most favorable\r\nopportunity for the development of solid and enduring character. It\r\nseems to me that the following words from one of our broadest minded men\r\napply with special force to the Negro:\r\n\r\n     If I had some magic gift to bestow it would be to make our country\r\n     youth see one truth, namely, that science as applied to the farm,\r\n     the garden and the forest has as splendid a dignity as astronomy;\r\n     that it may work just as many marvels and claim just as high an\r\n     order of talent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. AGRICULTURAL TRAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remain to be considered some of the agencies at work to better the\r\nlot of the farmer. In this I shall not attempt to give a list of\r\ninstitutions and outline of courses but to indicate various lines of\r\nwork which seem promising.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the training of the Negro farmer credit must first be\r\ngiven to the white planters under whom he has learned so much of what he\r\nknows. Under the changing conditions of agriculture this training, or\r\nthe training received on the average farm is not sufficient and must be\r\nsupplemented by special training if the desired results are to be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIt probably lay in the situation that the Negro should get the idea that\r\neducation meant freedom from labor. It is none the less unfortunate for\r\nhim. To counteract this idea has been a difficult matter and the\r\ninfluence of the average school has not been of any special help. The\r\ncountry school taught by a teacher, usually incompetent from any\r\nstandpoint, whose interest has been chiefly in the larger salary made\r\npossible by his \"higher education\" has not been an unmixed blessing. The\r\nchildren have learned to read and write and have preserved their notion\r\nthat if only they could get enough education they might be absolved from\r\nmanual labor. Even today Hampton and Tuskegee and similar schools have\r\nto contend with the opposition of parents who think their children\r\nshould not be compelled to work, for they are sent to school to enable\r\nthem to avoid labor. Quite likely it could not be expected that the\r\ncountry school should hold up a higher ideal, for here we have to do\r\nwith the beginnings of a system of instruction which had to make use of\r\nsuch material as it could find for teachers. The same excuse does not\r\nsuffice to explain the attitude taken by the bulk of schools maintained\r\nby the northern whites for the Negroes. Their inability to comprehend\r\nthe needs of the case can only be ascribed to the conception of a Negro\r\nas a white man with a black skin and a total failure to recognize the\r\nessential conditions of race progress. When the Roman monks penetrated\r\nthe German woods the chief benefits they carried were not embalmed in\r\nLatin grammars and the orations of Cicero, but were embodied in the\r\nknowledge of agriculture and the arts which, adopted by the people, made\r\npossible later the German civilization. The old rescue mission sought to\r\nyank the sinner out of the slough of despond, the social settlement\r\nseeks to help him who has fallen in the contest of life or him to whom\r\nthe opportunity has not been offered, to climb, recognizing that\r\nmorality and religion attend, not recede progress. The old charity gave\r\nalms and the country was overrun with hordes of beggars; the new seeks\r\nto help a man to help himself. A similar change must come in the efforts\r\nfor the Negro. It has been sought to give him the fruits of civilization\r\nwithout its bases. It will immediately be argued that this is wrong,\r\nthat the chief educational work has been but primary and that little\r\nso-called \"higher education\" has been given. This is true, even to the\r\nextent that it is possible to find a town of 5,000 inhabitants one-half\r\nNegroes, in which the city provides but one teacher for the black\r\nchildren and the balance are trained in a school supported by the gifts\r\nof northern people. But, and this is the important thing, the spirit of\r\nthe education has been clear and definite and that the plan has not been\r\ncarried out has not been due to lack of faith in it. General Armstrong,\r\nthanks to his observations in Hawaii, perceived that a different course\r\nwas necessary. His mantle fell on H. F. Frissell and Booker T.\r\nWashington, so Hampton and Tuskegee have been the chief factors in\r\nproducing the change which has been noted as coming. Now that industrial\r\ntraining is winning support it is amusing to note the anxiety of other\r\nschools to show that they have always believed in it. I can but feel\r\nthat had the plans of General Armstrong been widely adopted, had the\r\nteachers been trained to take the people where they were and lead them\r\nto gradual improvement, that the situation today would be radically\r\ndifferent. It is, however, not too late to do this yet and the\r\nwidespread founding of schools modeled after Hampton and Tuskegee\r\nindicates a general recognition of the needs of the situation.\r\n\r\nYet, even these schools have not turned out as many farmers as is often\r\nsupposed. On examination of the catalog of Tuskegee for 1901 I find only\r\nsixteen graduates who are farming and thirteen of these have other\r\noccupations (principally teaching). The combination, I think, desirable\r\nrather than otherwise. Three others are introducing cotton raising in\r\nAfrica under the German Government. From the industrial department nine\r\nhave received certificates in agriculture and six in dairying, but their\r\npresent occupations are not given. Asking a prominent man at Tuskegee\r\nfor the reason, he exclaimed, rather disgustedly, that they disliked\r\nwork and preferred to teach. This merely indicates the handicap Tuskegee\r\nhas to overcome, and perhaps the average agricultural college of the\r\nNorth cannot show a higher percentage of farmers. An official of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture tells me that only 5 per cent of the graduates\r\nof the agricultural colleges become farmers. To show how much\r\nagricultural training is given at Tuskegee the following statement for\r\nthe year 1902-3 is of interest: No pupil is counted twice. One hundred\r\nand eighty-one students are engaged in the actual operations of the\r\nfarm, truck garden, orchard, etc. Seventy-nine are taking the dairying,\r\netc., and 207 are taking agriculture as part of their academic work.\r\nYet, more of the graduates become professional men (lawyers, preachers,\r\netc.) than farmers, the proportion being about three to one. In citing\r\nTuskegee I am, of course, not forgetting that other schools, such as\r\nTougaloo and Talladega, have excellent farms and are seeking (though\r\ntheir chief emphasis is elsewhere) to give agricultural training.\r\n\r\nReverting to the different lines of work which seem hopeful, the subject\r\nmay be subdivided into several sections. We have first to do with the\r\nefforts to make the young child appreciate Nature and become interested\r\nin her processes. Perhaps Hampton has developed this side most\r\nextensively, both in the little garden plots cultivated by the children\r\nand the nature study leaflets prepared for use in other schools.\r\nPersonally I can but feel that there is a possibility of vastly\r\nextending such instruction by means of the country schools. If they may\r\nbe consolidated, and this is being done in many sections, I think a way\r\ncan be found to make the school house the social center of the district\r\nin such a way as will greatly help conditions.\r\n\r\nActual instruction in practical farming, dairying, horticulture, etc.,\r\nis given in an increasing number of schools, but the opportunities are\r\nstill very inadequate to the needs. If it be possible the way must be\r\nfound to enable the Negro to use more and better machinery. The average\r\nplanter does not care to introduce expensive machinery lest it be ruined\r\nby careless and ignorant tenants.\r\n\r\nThese industrial schools can never hope to reach more than a certain\r\npercentage of the people. There must be measures adopted to widen the\r\ninfluence of the school. Tuskegee may be mentioned for its attempts to\r\nreach out. For many years an annual Farmers' Conference has been held\r\nwhich bids fair to become the Mecca of the Negro farmer. The influence\r\nexerted cannot be measured, but it is believed to be great. One weak\r\nspot in many of the schools is that they have little if any direct\r\ninfluence upon the life of the community in which they are situated.\r\nThere are, however, some exceptions. The Calhoun Colored School has a\r\nfarmer's association meeting monthly. This is made up chiefly of men who\r\nare purchasing land through a company formed by the school. Topics of\r\nlocal interest, methods of farming, etc., are the subjects for\r\ndiscussion. There is also a mother's meeting with subjects of more\r\ndomestic interest, with a savings department for co-operative buying.\r\nCuriously enough the formation of the mother's meeting was at first\r\nopposed by the men (and by some whites), as it took the women out of the\r\nfields occasionally. Now it is more favored. As Tuskegee and many other\r\nplaces there are similar farmers' associations, of which no special\r\nmention need be made. Tuskegee has an outpost some miles from the school\r\nwhich is doing a general neighborhood work. The following papers\r\ncirculated by the school will give a general idea of their conceptions\r\nof the needs as well as of their efforts to influence conditions for the\r\nbetter:\r\n\r\n     MY DAILY WORK.\r\n\r\n     I may take in washing, but every day I promise myself that I will\r\n     do certain work for my family.\r\n\r\n     I will set the table for every meal. I will wash the dishes after\r\n     every meal.\r\n\r\n     Monday, I will do my family washing. I will put my bedclothes out\r\n     to air. I will clean the safe with hot water and soap.\r\n\r\n     Tuesday, I will do my ironing and family patching.\r\n\r\n     Wednesday, I will scrub my kitchen and clean my yard thoroughly.\r\n\r\n     Thursday, I will clean and air the meal and pork boxes. I will\r\n     scour my pots and pans with soap and ashes.\r\n\r\n     Friday, I will wash my dish cloth, dish towels and hand towels. I\r\n     will sweep and dust my whole house and clean everything thoroughly.\r\n\r\n     Sunday, I will go to church and Sunday school. I will take my\r\n     children with me. I will stay at home during the remainder of the\r\n     day. I will try to read something aloud helpful to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n     QUESTIONS THAT I WILL PLEDGE MYSELF TO ANSWER AT THE END OF THE\r\n     YEAR.\r\n\r\n     1. How many bushels of potatoes, corn, beans, peas and peanuts have\r\n     we raised this year?\r\n\r\n     2. How many hogs and poultry do we keep?\r\n\r\n     3. How much poultry have we raised?\r\n\r\n     4. How many bales of cotton have we raised?\r\n\r\n     5. How much have we saved to buy a home?\r\n\r\n     6. How much have we done towards planting flowers and making our\r\n     yard look pretty?\r\n\r\n     7. How many kinds of vegetables did we raise in our home garden?\r\n\r\n     8. How many times did we stay away from miscellaneous excursions\r\n     when we wished to go? What were our reasons for staying at home?\r\n\r\n     9. How have we helped our boys and girls to stay out of bad\r\n     company?\r\n\r\n     10. What paper have we taken, and why have we taken our children to\r\n     church and had them sit with us?\r\n\r\n\r\n     HOW TO MAKE HOME HAPPY.\r\n\r\n     Keep clean, body and soul. Remember that weak minds, diseased\r\n     bodies, bad acts are often the result of bad food.\r\n\r\n     Remember that you can set a good table by raising fruit,\r\n     vegetables, grains and your meat.\r\n\r\n     Remember that you intend to train your children to stay at home out\r\n     of bad company.\r\n\r\n     Remember that if you would have their minds and yours clean, you\r\n     will be obliged to help them learn something outside the school\r\n     room. Remember, that you can do this in no better way than by\r\n     taking a good paper--the New York Weekly Witness or The Sabbath\r\n     Reading, published in New York, cost very little. Have your\r\n     children read to you from the Bible and from the papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     YOUR NEEDS.\r\n\r\n     You need chairs in your house. Get boxes. Cover with bright calico,\r\n     and use them for seats until you can buy chairs.\r\n\r\n     You need plates, knives and forks, spoons and table cloths. Buy\r\n     them with the tobacco and snuff money.\r\n\r\n     You need more respect for self. Get it by staying away from street\r\n     corners, depots and, above all, excursions.\r\n\r\n     You need to stay away from these excursions to keep out of bad\r\n     company, out of court, out of jail, and out of the disgust of every\r\n     self-respecting person.\r\n\r\n     You need more race pride. Cultivate this as you would your crops.\r\n     It will mean a step forward.\r\n\r\n     You need a good home. Save all you can. Get your home, and that\r\n     will bring you nearer citizenship.\r\n\r\n     You can supply all these needs. When will you begin? Every moment\r\n     of delay is a loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n     HOW TO BECOME PROSPEROUS.\r\n\r\n     1. Keep no more than one dog.\r\n\r\n     2. Stay away from court.\r\n\r\n     3. Buy no snuff, tobacco and whisky.\r\n\r\n     4. Raise your own pork.\r\n\r\n     5. Raise your vegetables.\r\n\r\n     6. Put away thirty cents for every dollar you spend.\r\n\r\n     7. Keep a good supply of poultry. Set your hens. Keep your chickens\r\n     until they will bring a good price.\r\n\r\n     8. Go to town on Thursday instead of Saturday. Buy no more than you\r\n     need. Stay in town no longer than necessary.\r\n\r\n     9. Starve rather than sell your crops before you raise them. Let\r\n     your mind be fixed on that the first day of January, and stick to\r\n     that every day in the year.\r\n\r\n     10. Buy land and build you a home.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various states are beginning to establish institutions in which\r\nagriculture and industrial training may be given. Among these may be\r\nmentioned that of Alabama at Normal, and of Mississippi at Westside.\r\nAlabama has also established an experiment station in connection with\r\nthe Tuskegee Institute.\r\n\r\nIn Texas there is an interesting movement among the Negro farmers known\r\nas the \"Farmers' Improvement Society.\" The objects are:\r\n\r\n  1. Abolition of the credit system.\r\n  2. Stimulate improvements in farming.\r\n  3. Co-operative buying.\r\n  4. Sickness and life insurance.\r\n  5. Encouragement of purchase of land and home.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Association holds a fair each year which is largely attended.\r\nAccording to the Galveston _News_ of October 12, 1902, the society has\r\nabout 3,000 members, who own some 50,000 acres of land, more than 8,000\r\ncattle and 7,000 horses and mules. This organization, founded and\r\nmaintained entirely by Negroes, promises much in many ways. In October,\r\n1902, a fair was held in connection with the school at Calhoun, Ala.,\r\nwith 83 exhibitors and 416 entries, including 48 from the school and a\r\nvery creditable showing of farm products and live stock.\r\n\r\nBesides these general lines which seem to be of promise it is in place\r\nto mention a couple of attempts to get the Negroes to purchase land.\r\nThere have been not a few persons who have sold land to them on the\r\ninstallment plan with the expectation that later payments would be\r\nforfeited and the land revert. There are some enterprises which are\r\nabove suspicion. I am not referring now to private persons or railroad\r\ncompanies who have sold large tracts to the Negroes, but to\r\norganizations whose objects are to aid the blacks in becoming\r\nlandholders. The Land Company at Calhoun. Ala., started in 1896, buying\r\n1,040 acres of land, which was accurately surveyed and divided into\r\nplots of fifty acres, so arranged that each farm should include\r\ndifferent sorts of land. This was sold to the Negroes at cost price, $8\r\nper acre, the purchasers to pay 8 per cent on deferred payments. The\r\nsums paid by the purchasers each year have been as follows:\r\n\r\n  1896--$  741.03. Found later to be borrowed money in the main.\r\n  1897--$1,485.15. Largely borrowed money.\r\n  1898--$  367.34. Men paying back borrowed money. Advances large.\r\n  1899--$  374.77.\r\n  1900--$1,649.25. Money not borrowed. Advances small.\r\n  1901--$  871.49. Bad year. Poor crops. Money not borrowed.\r\n  1902--$2,280.42. Advances very small. Outlook encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been some failures on part of tenants, and it has been\r\nnecessary to gradually select the better men and allow the others to\r\ndrop out. The company has paid all expenses and interest on its capital.\r\nA second plantation has been purchased and is being sold. There is a\r\nmanager who is a trained farmer, and by means of the farmers'\r\nassociation already mentioned much pressure is brought to bear on the\r\nNegroes to improve their condition. The results are encouraging. In\r\nMacon County the Southern Land Company has purchased several thousand\r\nacres which it is selling in much the same way, but it is too early to\r\nspeak of results. Even at Calhoun but few of the men have yet gotten\r\ndeeds for their land.\r\n\r\nA word regarding the methods of the Southern Land Company will be of\r\ninterest. The land was carefully surveyed in forty-acre plots. These are\r\nsold at $8 per acre, the payments covering a period of seven years. The\r\ninterest is figured in advance, and to each plot is charged a yearly fee\r\nof $5 for management. In this total is also included the cost of house\r\nand well (a three-roomed cabin is furnished for about $100, a well for\r\n$10). This sum is then divided into seven equal parts so that the\r\npurchaser knows in advance just what he must pay each year. The object\r\nof the company is to encourage home ownership. Until the place is paid\r\nfor control of the planting, etc., remains with the manager of the\r\ncompany. Advances are in cash (except fertilizers), as no store is\r\nconducted by the company and interest is charged at 8 per cent for the\r\nmoney advanced and for the time said money is used.\r\n\r\nOn this place in 1902, H. W., a man aged 68, with wife and three\r\nchildren, owning a horse, a mule and two cows, did as follows. He and\r\nhis son-in-law are buying eighty acres. They made a good showing for the\r\nfirst year under considerable difficulties and on land by no means rich:\r\n\r\n                       Debits.             Credits.\r\n  Fertilizer           $ 34.88    Cotton    $390.32\r\n  Whitewashing            3.00\r\n  Liming                 19.76\r\n  Lease contract        180.00\r\n  Cash                  130.36\r\n  Interest                3.12\r\n                       -------\r\n                       $371.12\r\n                       -------\r\n  Balance Jan. 1, 1903 $ 19.20\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leads me to mention the question of land ownership on the part of\r\nthe Negroes. This has not been mentioned hitherto for several reasons.\r\nIn the first place the data for any detailed knowledge of the subject\r\nare not to be had. Few states make separate record of land owned by the\r\nblacks as distinct from general ownership. The census has to depend upon\r\nthe statements of the men themselves, and I have heard tenants solemnly\r\nargue that they owned the land. Again a very considerable proportion of\r\nthe land owned is also heavily mortgaged, and these mortgages are not\r\nalways for improvements. Nor is it by any means self evident that land\r\nownership necessarily means a more advanced condition than where land is\r\nrented. Moreover, a considerable proportion of the _farms_ owned are so\r\nsmall that they do not suffice to support the owners. Conditions vary in\r\ndifferent districts. In Virginia it has been possible to buy a few acres\r\nat a very low price. In parts of Alabama, or wherever the land has been\r\nheld in large estates in recent years, it has often been impossible for\r\nthe Negro to purchase land in small lots. Thus, though I believe\r\nheartily in land ownership for the blacks and believe that well\r\nconducted land associations will be beneficial, I cannot think that this\r\nalone will solve the questions confronting us. Retrogression is possible\r\neven with land ownership. Other things are necessary. On the basis of\r\nexisting data the best article with which I am acquainted on this\r\nsubject appeared in the _Southern Workman_ for January, 1903, written by\r\nDr. G. S. Dickerman, in which he showed that among the Negro farmers the\r\nowners and managers formed 59.8 per cent of the total in Virginia, 57.6\r\nper cent in Maryland, 48.6 per cent in Kentucky, falling as we go South\r\nto 15.1 per cent in Alabama, 16.4 per cent in Mississippi, and 16.2 per\r\ncent in Louisiana, rising to 30.9 per cent in Texas. Evidently the\r\nforces at work are various.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months, at the suggestion of Mr. Horace Plunkett, of the\r\nIrish Agricultural Organization Society, a new work has been taken up,\r\nwhose course will be watched with great interest. I quote from a letter\r\nof Mr. Plunkett to Dr. Wallace Buttrick, of the General Education Board:\r\n\r\n     From what I have seen of the negro character, my own impression is\r\n     that the race has those leader-following propensities which\r\n     characterize the Irish people. It has, too, I suspect, in its\r\n     mental composition the same vein of idealism which my own\r\n     countrymen possess, and which makes them susceptible to\r\n     organization, and especially to those forms of organization which\r\n     require the display of the social qualities to which I have alluded\r\n     and which you will have to develop. These characteristics which\r\n     express themselves largely, the old plantation songs, in the form\r\n     of religions exercises, and in the maintenance of a staff of\r\n     preachers out of all proportion I should think, to the spiritual\r\n     requirements, should, in my opinion, lend themselves to associative\r\n     action for practical ends if the organizing machinery necessary to\r\n     initiate such action were provided.\r\n\r\n     What, then, is my practical suggestion? It is that your board, if\r\n     it generally approves of the idea, should take one, two, or, at the\r\n     most, three communities, such as that we inquired about, and organize\r\n     them on the Irish plan. The farmers should at first he advised to\r\n     confine their efforts to some simple object, such as the joint\r\n     purchase of their immediate agricultural requirements. * * * I would\r\n     at first deal solely with the colored people, beginning in a very\r\n     small way, leaving larger developments for the future to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\nHampton Institute has taken up the suggestion and is planning to\r\norganize a community. Everything will, of course, depend on the\r\nmanagement as well as on the people. If the results are as satisfactory\r\nas they have been in Ireland the efforts will be well expended.\r\n\r\nWith this brief and incomplete account we must take leave of the Negro\r\nfarmer. Throughout the thesis I have attempted to keep two or three\r\nfundamental propositions constantly in sight. Briefly summarized these\r\nare that we have to do with a race whose inherited characteristics are\r\nlargely of African origin; that these have been somewhat modified under\r\nAmerican influences, but are still potent; that the economic environment\r\nin America is not a unit and must finally result in the creation of\r\ndifferent types among the blacks; that the needs of the different\r\nhabitats are various; that the segregation from the mass of the whites\r\nis fraught with serious consequences; that measures of wider application\r\nmust be adopted if the Negro is to bear his proper part in the progress\r\nof the country; that owing to the great race differences the whites must\r\ntake an active interest in the blacks; that in spite of the many\r\nhandicaps under which the Negro struggles the outlook is not hopeless if\r\nhis willingness to work can so be directed that a surplus will result.\r\nTo my mind the Negro must work out his salvation, economic and social.\r\nIt cannot be given without destroying the very thing we seek to\r\nstrengthen--character. This is the justification for the emphasis now\r\nlaid upon industrial training. This training and the resulting character\r\nare the pre-requisites of all race progress. Industrial education is\r\nthus not a fad nor a mere expedient to satisfy the selfish demands of\r\nsouthern whites. It is the foundation without which the superstructure\r\nis in vain. If I have fairly stated the difficulties in the way and have\r\nshown the possibility of ultimate success, I am content. For the future\r\nI am hopeful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPS SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEGROES IN THE SOUTHERN STATES\r\n\r\n     These maps are particularly referred to in Chapter II.
