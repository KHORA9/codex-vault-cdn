Dyson[1]\r\n               Head, Department of Geology and Geography\r\n                           Lafayette College\r\n\r\nThe glaciers of Glacier National Park are only a few of many thousands\r\nwhich occur in mountain ranges scattered throughout the world. Glaciers\r\noccur in all latitudes and on every continent except Australia. They are\r\npresent along the Equator on high volcanic peaks of Africa and in the\r\nrugged Andes of South America. Even in New Guinea, which many think of\r\nas a steaming, tropical jungle island, a few small glaciers occur on the\r\nhighest mountains.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone who has made a trip to a high mountain range has heard\r\nthe term, “snowline,” and many persons have used the word without\r\nknowing its real meaning. The snowline is the level above which more\r\nsnow falls in winter than can be melted or evaporated during the summer.\r\nOn mountains which rise above the snowline glaciers usually occur. The\r\nsnowline is an elusive feature and can be seen only in late summer. For\r\nexample, during the latter part of June snow extends from the summits of\r\nmost Glacier National Park mountains down their slopes to timberline,\r\nand some snowbanks extend even lower. At that time the snowline appears\r\nto be down near timberline. But as the summer progresses and higher\r\ntemperatures melt the lower-lying snowbanks this apparent snowline\r\nretreats higher and higher up the slopes, until late August or early\r\nSeptember, when it reaches a point above which it will not retreat. This\r\nlower limit of snow is the permanent or regional snowline. It is usually\r\nreferred to simply as the snowline. In Glacier National Park the\r\nregional snowline actually lies above the summits of most peaks, at a\r\nheight of more than 10,000 feet. The only parts of the United States\r\nsouth of Canada which project above the snowline are the highest summits\r\nin the Cascade Range in California, Oregon, and Washington, and in the\r\nOlympic Mountains in the latter state. There are many mountains in\r\nAlaska that lie above the snowline. This is especially true in the\r\ncoastal ranges where the snowline is around 4,500 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nThe Olympic area is unique, for here the regional snowline descends to\r\nabout 6,000 feet lower than anywhere within the boundaries of the\r\nContinental United States south of Alaska. Extraordinarily heavy annual\r\nsnowfall and the high percentage of cloudy weather, which retards the\r\nmelting of snow, combine to depress the snowline to such a low level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Glaciers of Glacier National Park\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the boundaries of Glacier National Park there are 50 to 60\r\nglaciers, of which only two have surface areas of nearly one-half square\r\nmile, and not more than seven others exceed one-fourth square mile in\r\narea.\r\n\r\nAll these bodies of ice lie at the heads of valleys with high steep\r\nheadwalls on the east and north sides of high ridges at elevations\r\nbetween 6,000 and 9,000 feet, in all cases well below the snowline.\r\nConsequently, these glaciers owe their origin and existence almost\r\nentirely to wind-drifted snow.\r\n\r\nIce within these glaciers moves slowly. The average rate in the smallest\r\nones may be as low as 6 to 8 feet a year, and in the largest probably 25\r\nto 30 feet a year. There is no period of the year when a glacier is\r\nmotionless, although movement is somewhat slower in winter than in\r\nsummer. Despite the slowness of its motion the ice, over a period of\r\nyears, transports large quantities of rock material ultimately to the\r\nglacier’s end where it is piled up in the form of a moraine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FRONT OF SPERRY GLACIER]\r\n\r\nThe largest glacier in the Park is Grinnell. In 1960 it had a surface\r\narea of 315 acres.\r\n\r\nSperry is the second largest glacier in the Park. Its surface in 1960\r\nwas 287 acres. Both Grinnell and Sperry have probable maximum\r\nthicknesses of 400 to 500 feet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JACKSON GLACIER IS VISIBLE FROM GOING-TO-THE-SUN ROAD\r\n    (BEATTY PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nOther important Park glaciers, although much smaller than the first two\r\nmentioned, are Harrison, Chaney, Sexton, Jackson, Blackfoot, Siyeh, and\r\nAhern. Several others approach some of these in size, but because of\r\nisolated locations they are seldom seen. As a matter of fact, there are\r\npersons who visit Glacier National Park without seeing a single glacier,\r\nwhile others, although they actually see glaciers, leave the park\r\nwithout realizing they have seen them. This is because the highways\r\nafford only distant views of the glaciers, which from a distance appear\r\nmuch like mere accumulations of snow. A notable example is Grinnell as\r\nseen from the highway along the shore of Sherburne Lake and from the\r\nvicinity of the Many Glacier Entrance Station. The glacier, despite its\r\nlength of almost a mile, appears merely as a conspicuous white patch\r\nhigh up on the Garden Wall at the head of the valley.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the glaciers, however, are accessible by trail and are\r\nannually visited by many hundreds of people, either on foot or by horse.\r\nMost accessible of all Park glaciers is Grinnell. It can be reached by a\r\nsix-mile trip over an excellent trail from Many Glacier Hotel or\r\nSwiftcurrent Camp. Sperry, likewise, can be reached by trail, although\r\nthe distance is several miles greater than in the case of Grinnell. The\r\ntrip, however, can be broken and possibly made more interesting by an\r\novernight stop at Sperry Chalet, which is located about three miles from\r\nthe glacier. Siyeh is the only other regularly visited Park glacier. It\r\nlies about half a mile beyond the end of the Cracker Lake trail, and can\r\nbe reached from that point by an easy walk through grassy meadows and a\r\nshort climb over a moraine. Siyeh, however, is less spectacular than\r\neither Grinnell or Sperry, being much smaller and lacking crevasses, so\r\ncommon on the other two. Few people make the spectacular trail trip over\r\nSiyeh Pass but those who do may visit Sexton Glacier by making a short\r\ndetour of less than half a mile where the trail crosses the bench on\r\nwhich the glacier lies. Sexton is a small glacier, but late in the\r\nsummer after its snow cover has melted off it exhibits many of the\r\nfeatures seen on much larger bodies of ice.\r\n\r\nInteresting surface features which can be seen at times on any of these\r\nglaciers include crevasses, moulins (glacier wells), debris cones, and\r\nglacier tables. Crevasses are cracks which occur in the ice of all\r\nglaciers. They are especially numerous on Sperry and Grinnell. Moulins,\r\nor glacier wells, are deep vertical holes which have been formed by a\r\nstream of water which originally plunged into a narrow crevasse.\r\nContinual flow of the stream enlarges that part of the crevasse,\r\ncreating a well. Several such features on Sperry Glacier have penetrated\r\nto depths of more than 200 feet, and are 20 or more feet wide at the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nNo one can walk over the surface of Grinnell Glacier without noticing a\r\nnumber of conical mounds of fine rock debris. Actually these are cones\r\nof ice covered with a veneer, seldom more than two inches thick, of rock\r\ndebris, so their name, debris cone is somewhat misleading.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CREVASSE IN SPERRY GLACIER]\r\n\r\nThis rock material, usually deposited by a stream, protects the ice\r\nunderneath from the sun’s rays. As the surface of the glacier, except\r\nthat insulated by the debris, is lowered by melting, the mounds form and\r\ngrow gradually higher until the debris slides from them, after which\r\nthey are speedily reduced to the level of the rest of the surface. They\r\nare seldom higher than 3 or 4 feet.\r\n\r\nA glacier table is a mound of ice capped, and therefore protected from\r\nmelting, by a large boulder. Its history is similar to that of the\r\ndebris cone. After a time the boulder slides off its perch, and then the\r\nmound of ice melts away.\r\n\r\nSnow which fills crevasses and wells during the winter often melts out\r\nfrom below, leaving thin snowbridges in the early part of the summer.\r\nThese constitute real hazards to travel on a glacier because the thinner\r\nones are incapable of supporting a person’s weight. This is one very\r\ngood reason why the inexperienced should never venture onto the surface\r\nof a glacier without a guide.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Park glaciers are not remnants of the large\r\nglaciers present during the Ice Age which terminated approximately\r\n10,000 years ago, because it is known that several thousand years after\r\nthat time the climate of the Glacier National Park region was somewhat\r\ndrier and warmer than now. Under such conditions it is probable that\r\nmost, if not all, of the present glaciers could not have existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Shrinkage of Park Glaciers\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the beginning of the present century all glaciers in the Park,\r\nand most of those in the rest of the world, began to shrink in response\r\nto a slight change in climate, probably involving both a temperature\r\nrise and a decrease in annual snowfall. From about 1900 to 1945\r\nshrinkage of Park glaciers was very rapid. In other words these glaciers\r\nwere not in equilibrium with the climate, for less ice was added to them\r\neach winter than disappeared by melting and evaporation during the\r\nremainder of the year.\r\n\r\nOver a period of several years such shrinkage is apparent to the eye of\r\nan observer and is manifest by a lowering of the glacier’s surface, and\r\nmore particularly by a “retreat” of the lower edge of the glacier. This\r\npart of the ice is generally referred to as the ice front. When\r\nsufficient snow is added to the upper part of the glacier to cause the\r\nice at the front to move forward equal to the rate at which it melts\r\naway, the glacier is in equilibrium with the climate. When the yearly\r\nadded snow decreases in amount the ice front seems to retreat or move\r\nback, whereas the mass of the glacier is merely decreasing by melting on\r\ntop and along the edges, just as a cube of ice left in the kitchen sink\r\ndecreases in size.\r\n\r\nThe National Park Service initiated observations on glacier variations\r\nin 1931. At first the work consisted only of the determination of the\r\nyear by year changes in the ice front of each of the several glaciers.\r\nFrom 1937 to 1939, inclusive, the program was expanded to include the\r\ndetailed mapping of Grinnell, Sperry, and Jackson Glaciers to serve as a\r\nbasis for comparisons in future years. Aerial photographs were obtained\r\nof all the known Park glaciers in 1950 and 1952 and again in 1960. Maps\r\nhave been compiled and published of the Grinnell and Sperry Glaciers\r\nbased on the 1950 and 1960 aerial photography. The 1950 and 1960 maps of\r\neach glacier are shown on one sheet for convenience in comparison.\r\n\r\nSince 1945, the glacier observations have been carried on in cooperation\r\nwith the U. S. Geological Survey. The work has included the periodic\r\nmeasurement of profiles to determine changes occurring in the surface\r\nelevation of Grinnell and Sperry Glaciers and also the determination of\r\nthe rate of annual movement. Some of the more important data yielded by\r\nsurveys on Grinnell and Sperry, the two largest glaciers in the Park,\r\nare summarized in the following tabulations:\r\n\r\n                             GRINNELL GLACIER\r\n Year   Area                            Remarks\r\n       (Acres)\r\n\r\n 1901  525     From Chief Mountain topographic quadrangle map.\r\n 1937  384     From mapping by J. L. Dyson and Gibson of lower portion\r\n               of glacier plus area of upper glacier (56 acres), as\r\n               shown on 1950 USGS map.\r\n 1946  336     As above.\r\n 1950  328     From USGS map compiled from aerial photography.\r\n 1960  315     As above.\r\n\r\nThe Grinnell Glacier originally consisted of an upper and lower portion\r\nconnected by an ice tongue. This tongue disappeared in 1926 and since\r\nthen the two portions have been separate. The area of the upper portion\r\nof the glacier was essentially the same in 1960 as in 1956—56 acres. The\r\nupper section is known as Salamander Glacier because of its shape as\r\nviewed from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe terminal recession of the Grinnell Glacier is somewhat difficult to\r\ndetermine accurately as a part of the terminal portion ends in a lake,\r\nthe shore of which varies from year to year. The recession for a\r\nhalf-mile section extending southeast from the lake is shown below:\r\n\r\n   Period    Recession during    Total Recession      Average annual\r\n              period (feet)     since 1937 (feet)    recession (feet)\r\n\r\n  1937-45          270                 270                  34\r\n  1945-50           75                 345                  15\r\n  1950-60           85                 430                  8\r\n\r\nThe values for area and recession shown above indicate that changes in\r\nthe area of the glacier have not been as pronounced since the mid-1940’s\r\nas they were prior to that time. Profile measurements starting in 1950\r\nindicate a general trend of continued shrinkage although annual changes\r\nhave been both positive and negative. The 1965 observations showed a\r\nsurface lowering of 20 to 25 feet, since 1950.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the Grinnell Glacier, based on observations since 1947,\r\nhas been about 35 to 40 feet per year.\r\n\r\nThe Sperry Glacier is located 9 miles from the Grinnell Glacier, on the\r\nopposite side of the Continental Divide and at an altitude approximately\r\n1,000 feet higher. It has also shown a continual shrinkage in area and\r\nrecession of the terminus as shown by the following tabulations:\r\n\r\n                              SPERRY GLACIER\r\n Year   Area                            Remarks\r\n       (Acres)\r\n\r\n 1901  810     From Chief Mountain topographic quadrangle map.\r\n 1938  390     From mapping by J.

Above this\r\naltitude it has remained much the same during the period of observations\r\nwith annual changes, both positive and negative, with a possible slight\r\nnet increase since 1949.\r\n\r\nThe forward movement in the central portion of the Sperry Glacier, based\r\non observations since 1949, has averaged about 15 feet per year. The\r\nrate of movement is presumed to be greater in the upper reaches of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to note from the data that the changes in Sperry\r\nGlacier are more pronounced than those in Grinnell Glacier although the\r\nstraight-line distance between them is only 9 miles. One possible\r\nreason—Grinnell Glacier is on the eastern slope of the Continental\r\nDivide whereas Sperry Glacier is on the western slope.\r\n\r\nEven more significant is the lowering of the glacier’s surface, from\r\nwhich volume shrinkage may be obtained. In 1938 Sperry Glacier had a\r\nthickness of 108 feet at the site of the 1946 ice margin. At this same\r\nplace in 1913 the thickness was nearly 500 feet, and the average\r\nthickness of the glacier over the area from which it has since\r\ndisappeared was at least 300 feet.\r\n\r\nThe average thickness of Grinnell Glacier in 1937 at the site of the\r\n1946 ice front was 73 feet. The surface of the entire glacier was\r\nlowered 56 feet during that nine-year period. This means that each year\r\nthe glacier was reduced in volume by an amount of ice equivalent to a\r\ncube 450 feet high.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GRINNELL GLACIER AS IT LOOKED PRIOR TO 1926 WHEN THE\r\n    LOWER AND UPPER SEGMENTS WERE STILL CONNECTED.]\r\n\r\nAt the northern terminus of Grinnell Glacier, which is bordered by a\r\nsmall marginal lake, a large section of the ice front fell into the\r\nwater on or about August 14, 1946, completely filling it with icebergs.\r\nThis event, although witnessed by no one, must have been comparable to\r\nmany of the icefalls which occur at the fronts of the large glaciers\r\nalong the southeast coast of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe volume of Grinnell Glacier was reduced by about one-third from\r\nSeptember 1937 to September 1946. Several other glaciers have exhibited\r\na more phenomenal shrinkage than Sperry or Grinnell. The topographic map\r\nof Glacier National Park, prepared in 1900-1902, shows several\r\ncomparatively large glaciers such as Agassiz, Blackfoot and Harrison.\r\nTheir shrinkage has been so pronounced that today Agassiz has virtually\r\ndisappeared and the other two are pitifully small remnants, probably\r\nless than one-fifth the size they had been when originally mapped.\r\n\r\nSince 1945, because of above-normal snowfall and subnormal temperatures,\r\nglacier shrinkage has slowed down appreciably, coming virtually to a\r\nstandstill in 1950; and in 1951, for the first time since glacier\r\nchanges have been recorded in the Park, Grinnell Glacier increased\r\nslightly in volume. This was also reflected by a readvance of the front.\r\nAlthough no measurements were made in 1951 on other Park glaciers some\r\nof them certainly made similar readvances. Thus the climatic conditions\r\nwhich caused glaciers to shrink for fifty or more years seem to have\r\nbeen replaced by conditions more favorable to the glaciers. Time alone\r\nwill tell whether the new conditions are temporary or mark the beginning\r\nof a long cycle of wetter and cooler climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Former Extent of Park Glaciation\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Pleistocene Period or Ice Age when most of Canada and a large\r\nportion of the United States were covered several times by an extensive\r\nice sheet or continental glacier, all the valleys of Glacier National\r\nPark were filled with valley glaciers. These originated in the higher\r\nparts of the Lewis and Livingstone Ranges. On the east side of the Lewis\r\nRange they moved out onto the plains. From the Livingstone Range and the\r\nwest side of the Lewis Range they moved into the wide Flathead Valley.\r\nDuring the maximum extent of these glaciers all of the area of the Park\r\nexcept the summits of the highest peaks and ridges were covered with\r\nice.\r\n\r\nThe great Two Medicine Glacier, with its source in the head of the Two\r\nMedicine and tributary valleys, after reaching the plains spread out\r\ninto a big lobe (piedmont glacier) eventually attaining a distance of\r\nabout 40 miles from the eastern front of the mountains. The stream of\r\nice emerging onto the plains from St. Mary Valley also extended many\r\nmiles out from the mountain front. Several of these long valley glaciers\r\nextended far enough out onto the plains to meet the edge of the vast\r\ncontinental ice sheet moving westward from a center in the vicinity of\r\nHudson Bay. In the major Park valleys these glaciers attained\r\nthicknesses of 3,000 or more feet. Although man probably never viewed\r\nthis magnificent spectacle, the Park at that time must have been similar\r\nin aspect to some of the present day ice filled ranges along the\r\nAlaska-Yukon border.\r\n\r\nNo one knows exactly how many times glaciers moved down the Park valleys\r\nduring the million or more years of the Pleistocene period, but\r\ngeologists have found evidence for at least eight distinct advances. It\r\nis difficult to determine just when the first advance took place but it\r\nmay have been very early in the period. Most of the advances, however,\r\noccurred during the past 70,000 years or so in what is known as the\r\nWisconsin stage of the Ice Age. Large glaciers flowed down the Park\r\nvalleys probably as late as 7,000 years ago. Between each of the major\r\ntimes of ice advance, the glaciers, responding to warmer or drier\r\nclimate, shrank to small size and in some instances disappeared. These\r\nwarmer intervals varied in length from 2,000 to tens of thousands of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the several distinct glacial advances is yielded by the\r\nmoraines, deposits of rock debris left by the ice. On the east side of\r\nthe Park the lower courses of the major valleys and the adjoining ridges\r\nin the Park and on the adjacent plains are covered with moraines. The\r\nmaterial in them ranges in size from clay to large boulders, and was\r\ndeposited by glaciers after being transported down the valleys. The\r\ndebris deposited by the latest ice advance is fresh in appearance and\r\ncontains fragments of all Park rocks. Moraines of the earlier stages,\r\nbecause of much greater age, are more weathered. They contain many\r\nfragments of much weathered diorite, from the layer of rock that appears\r\nas a conspicuous black band on many of the mountains, and almost no\r\nfragments of limestone, so common in the newest moraines. The diorite is\r\nmore resistant to weathering than the limestone which slowly dissolves\r\nin ground-water. The only localities where the oldest moraine occurs are\r\nthe crests of the ridges which run eastward from the mountains out onto\r\nthe plains. This material is especially abundant on St. Mary Ridge. On\r\ntop of Two Medicine Ridge along and just above the highway, fragments of\r\nthis material have been cemented together into a comparatively hard\r\ntillite. Lower down on the slopes the older moraine cannot be found as\r\nit is covered by that of the later glacial advances which were less\r\nextensive and did not override the ridge crests as did the earlier\r\nglaciers. The older debris is also found on top of Milk River and\r\nBoulder Ridges.\r\n\r\nFollowing the last maximum advance of the Wisconsin glaciers they slowly\r\nshrank until about 6,000 years ago when all glacial ice probably\r\ndisappeared from the mountains. After this there was a warm, dry period\r\nduring which it is probable that no glaciers were present. Then about\r\n4,000 years ago the present small glaciers were born. During the period\r\nof their existence they have fluctuated in size, probably attaining\r\nmaximum dimensions around the middle of the last century. Since then\r\nthey have been getting smaller.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PANORAMIC VIEW OF GRINNELL GLACIER AS IT APPEARED IN\r\n    1945.

The first\r\nis more active near the head of the glacier, but may take place anywhere\r\nthroughout its course; abrasion or scouring is effective underneath most\r\nsections of the glacier, particularly where the ice moves in a\r\nwell-defined channel.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MT. OBERLIN CIRQUE AND BIRD WOMAN FALLS (HILEMAN\r\n    PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nIn plucking, the glacier actually quarries out masses of rock,\r\nincorporates them within itself, and carries them along. At the head of\r\nthe glacier this is accomplished mainly by water which trickles into\r\ncrevices and freezes around blocks of rock, causing them to be pulled\r\nout by the glacier, and also by the weight of the glacier, squeezing ice\r\ninto the cracks in the rock. As the glacier moves forward these blocks\r\nof ice are dragged or carried along with it. Usually a large crevasse,\r\nthe bergschrund, develops in the ice at the head of a glacier. The\r\nbergschrund of most glaciers in the park consists of an opening, usually\r\n10 to 20 feet wide at the top and as much as 50 feet deep, between the\r\nhead of the glacier and the mountain wall. On Sperry Glacier, however,\r\nit is more typical of that found on larger valley glaciers and consists\r\nof several conspicuous crevasses separating the firn area (where the\r\nsnow is compacted into ice) on top of Gunsight Mountain from the glacier\r\nproper below (see photo on the cover). It is at this site that plucking\r\nis most dominant because water enters by day and freezes in the rock\r\ncrevices at night. This quarrying headward and downward finally results\r\nin the formation of a steep-sided basin called a cirque or glacial\r\namphitheatre. Because the cirque is the first place that ice forms and\r\nthe place from which it disappears last, it is subjected to glacial\r\nerosion longer than any other part of the valley. Thus its floor is\r\nfrequently plucked and scraped out to a comparatively great depth so\r\nthat a body of water known as a cirque lake forms after the glacier\r\ndisappears. Iceberg Lake lies in one of the most magnificent cirques in\r\nthe Park. The lowest point on the crest of the wall encircling three\r\nsides of the lake is more than 1500 feet above the water. Prior to 1940\r\nthis cirque contained a small glacier. It has been shrinking rapidly for\r\nabout two decades, and in the last two or three years of its existence\r\nwas hardly recognizable as a glacier. Its disappearance is made more\r\nremarkable by the knowledge that in 1920 the front of the glacier rose\r\nin a sheer wall of ice nearly 100 feet above the surface of the lake.\r\nAll that remains of this glacier which once kept the lake filled with\r\nicebergs each summer is a large bank of snow at the base of the cirque\r\nwall at the head of the lake. Other good examples of cirques are those\r\nwhich hold Hidden, Avalanche and Cracker Lakes. The tremendous cliff on\r\nthe south side of the latter rises 4,100 feet from the lake to the\r\nsummit of Mount Siyeh. Other notable cirque lakes are Ellen Wilson,\r\nGunsight, Ptarmigan and Upper Two Medicine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ST. MARY VALLEY FROM LOGAN PASS SHOWING GLACIAL\r\n    PROFILE (HILEMAN PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nRock fragments of various sizes frozen into the bottom and sides of the\r\nice form a huge file or rasp which abrades or wears away the bottom and\r\nsides of the valley down which the glacier flows. The valley thus\r\nattains a characteristic U-shaped cross section, with steep sides (not\r\nnecessarily vertical) and a broad bottom. A mountain valley cut entirely\r\nby a stream does not have such shape because the stream cuts only in the\r\nbottom of the valley, whereas a glacier, filling its valley to a great\r\ndepth, abrades along the sides as well as on the floor. Practically all\r\nvalleys of the Park, especially the major ones, possess the U-shaped\r\ncross section. This feature can best be seen by looking down from the\r\nhead of the valley rather than from the valley floor. Splendid examples\r\nare the Swiftcurrent Valley viewed from Swiftcurrent Pass or Lookout;\r\nSt. Mary Valley from east of Logan Pass; the Belly River Valley from\r\nPtarmigan Tunnel; and Cataract Creek Valley from Grinnell Glacier.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGURE 1. IDEALIZED SKETCH OF A GLACIAL STAIRWAY FROM\r\n    THE ARETE AT THE CENTER OF THE RANGE TO THE ICE AGE MORAINE AT THE\r\n    MOUTH OF THE VALLEY.]\r\n\r\n  Cirque wall\r\n  Glacier\r\n  Lake\r\n  Moraine\r\n\r\nThe floors of many of the Park’s major U-shaped valleys instead of\r\nhaving a more or less uniform slope, steeper near the head than farther\r\ndown, as is usually the case in a normal stream valley, are marked by\r\nseveral steep drops or “steps,” between which the valley floor has a\r\ncomparatively gentle slope. Such a valley floor, throughout its entire\r\ncourse, is sometimes termed the glacial stairway. Most of the steps,\r\nparticularly those in the lower courses of the valleys, are due to\r\ndifferences in resistance of the rocks over which the former ice flowed.\r\nOn the east side of the Lewis Range, where the steps are especially\r\npronounced, the rock strata of which the mountains are composed dip\r\ntoward the southwest, directly opposite to the direction of the slope of\r\nthe valley floors (Figure 1). Thus, as glaciers flowed from the center\r\nof the range down toward the plains, they cut across the edges of these\r\ntilted rock layers; where the ice flowed over weaker beds it was able to\r\nscour out the valley floor more deeply creating a “tread” of the glacial\r\nstairway. The more resistant rock formations were less easily removed,\r\nand the ice stream, in moving away from the edges of these resistant\r\nstrata, employed its powers of plucking and quarrying to give rise to\r\ncliffs or “risers.” Lakes dammed partly by the resistant rock strata now\r\nfill depressions scoured out of the weaker rock on the treads (Figure 1\r\n). These are rock-basin lakes, and where several of them are strung out\r\nalong the course of the valley they are referred to as paternoster lakes\r\nbecause their arrangement resembles that of beads on a string.\r\nWell-known examples of such bodies of water are Swiftcurrent and\r\nBullhead Lakes, two of the long series which stretches for seven miles\r\nbetween Many Glacier Hotel and Swiftcurrent Pass. Resistant layers in\r\nthe lower portion of the Altyn formation, the upper part of the\r\nAppekunny, and the upper part of the Grinnell[2] normally create risers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TYPICAL GLACIAL VALLEY WITH CHAIN OF ROCK-BASIN\r\n    LAKES. GLENN AND CROSSLEY LAKES IN DISTANCE; UNNAMED LAKE IN\r\n    FOREGROUND RESTS IN A HANGING VALLEY AND ITS OUTLET DROPS SEVERAL\r\n    HUNDRED FEET TO THE MAIN VALLEY (HILEMAN PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nThe tributaries of glacial valleys are also peculiar in that they\r\nusually enter the main valley high above its floor and for this reason\r\nare known as hanging valleys. The thicker a stream of ice, the more\r\nerosion it is capable of performing; consequently, the main valley\r\nbecomes greatly deepened, whereas the smaller glacier in the tributary\r\nvalley does not cut down so rapidly, leaving its valley hanging high\r\nabove the floor of the major valley. The valleys of Virginia and\r\nFlorence Creeks, tributary to the St. Mary Valley are excellent examples\r\nof hanging valleys. A splendid view of Virginia Creek valley may be had\r\nfrom Going-to-the-Sun Road near the head of St. Mary Lake. The valley\r\nabove Bird Woman Falls as seen from Going-to-the-Sun Road just west of\r\nLogan Pass is a spectacular illustration of a hanging valley. In\r\naddition there are many others, such as Preston Park, on the trail from\r\nSt. Mary to Piegan Pass; and the Hanging Gardens near Logan Pass.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: REYNOLDS MOUNTAIN AT LOGAN PASS—A TYPICAL HORN]\r\n\r\nEven more conspicuous than the large U-shaped valleys and their hanging\r\ntributaries are the long, sharp-crested, jagged ridges which form most\r\nof the backbone of the Lewis Range. These features of which the Garden\r\nWall is one of the most noticeable, are known as aretes and owe their\r\norigin to glaciers. As the former long valley glaciers enlarged their\r\ncirques by cutting farther in toward the center of the range, the latter\r\nfinally was reduced to a very narrow steep-sided ridge, the arete. The\r\nimposing height of the Garden Wall can readily be determined by using\r\nthe layer of diorite as a scale. The conspicuous black band formed by\r\nthe edge of this layer has an average width of 75 feet. So, from the\r\nporch of the Many Glacier Hotel a Park visitor can readily see that the\r\nGarden Wall, even though five miles distant, is about 4,200 feet high.\r\nThe height of other aretes can be just as readily obtained, for the band\r\nof diorite appears on the faces of most of them. In certain places\r\nglaciers on opposite sides of the arete nearly cut through creating a\r\nlow place known as a col, usually called a pass. Gunsight, Logan, Red\r\nEagle, Stoney Indian and Piegan are only a few of the many such passes\r\nin the Park. At places three or more glaciers plucked their way back\r\ntoward a common point leaving at their heads a conspicuous,\r\nsharp-pointed peak known as a horn. Innumerable such horn peaks occur\r\nthroughout both the Lewis and Livingstone Ranges. Excellent examples\r\nnear Logan Pass are Reynolds, Bearhat, and Clements Mountains. Other\r\nimposing horns are Split Mountain at the head of Red Eagle Valley,\r\nKinnerly Peak in the Kintla Valley, and Mount Wilbur in Swiftcurrent\r\nValley. The horn peak, because of its precipitous sides, is especially\r\nattractive to mountain climbers. The comparatively recent dates of first\r\nascents on many Park peaks attest to the difficulties they offer the\r\nmountaineer. Mount Wilbur, despite proximity to Many Glacier Hotel and\r\ncamp, was unclimbed until 1923; Mount St. Nicholas succumbed in 1926,\r\nand the first ascent of Kinnerly Peak was made by several members of the\r\nSierra Club in 1937.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the Park which must be attributed partly to\r\nglaciation is the waterfall. There are two principal types, one which\r\noccurs in the bottom of the main valleys and one at the mouth of the\r\nhanging tributary valleys. The former, exemplified by Swiftcurrent, Red\r\nRock, Dawn Mist, Trick, Morning Eagle and others, is located where\r\nstreams drop over the risers of the glacial stairway. In other words,\r\nresistant layers of rock which the former glaciers were unable to\r\nentirely wear away give rise to this type of fall.\r\n\r\nExamples of the hanging tributary type of fall which is due directly to\r\nthe activity of the glaciers are Florence, Bird Woman, Virginia,\r\nGrinnell, Lincoln, and many others.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TRICK FALLS IN THE TWO MEDICINE RIVER]\r\n\r\nNo less conspicuous than the mountains themselves are the lakes. In most\r\ninstances glaciers have been either directly or indirectly responsible\r\nfor the origin of the several hundred in the Park. In general, these\r\nlakes may be divided into five main types, depending upon their origin.\r\n\r\n(1) Cirque lakes. This type of lake frequently is circular in outline\r\nand fills the depression plucked out of solid rock by a glacier at its\r\nsource. Some of the most typical examples are listed in the foregoing\r\ndiscussion of cirques.\r\n\r\n(2) Other rock-basin lakes. This type, referred to above, fills basins\r\ncreated where glaciers moved over areas of comparatively weak rock. In\r\nall cases the lake is held in by a bedrock dam. A typical example is\r\nSwiftcurrent, which lies behind a dam of massive Altyn Limestone layers.\r\nThe highway, just before it reaches Many Glacier Hotel, crosses this\r\nriser of the glacier stairway.\r\n\r\n(3) Lakes held in by outwash. Most of the large lakes on the west side\r\nof the Park fall in this category. The dams holding in these lakes are\r\ncomposed of stratified gravel which was washed out from former glaciers\r\nwhen they extended down into the lower parts of the valleys. Lake\r\nMcDonald, largest in the Park, is of this type.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ST. MARY LAKE FROM GOOSE ISLAND OVERLOOK]\r\n\r\n(4) Lakes held by alluvial fans. St. Mary, Waterton, Lower St. Mary, and\r\nLower Two Medicine Lakes belong in this group. These bodies of water may\r\nhave been rock-basin lakes, but at a recent date on their history\r\nstreams entering the lake valley have completely blocked the valley with\r\ndeposits of gravel; thus either creating a lake or raising the level of\r\none already present. St. Mary and Lower St. Mary Lakes probably were\r\njoined originally to make a lake 17 miles long. More recently Divide\r\nCreek, entering this long lake from the south, built an alluvial fan of\r\ngravel where it entered the lake. This fan was large enough to cut the\r\nlake into the two present bodies of water. The St. Mary Entrance Station\r\nat the eastern end of Going-to-the-Sun Road, is located on this alluvial\r\nfan, the form of which can readily be distinguished from a point along\r\nthe road at the north side of the upper lake near its outlet.\r\n\r\n(5) Moraine lakes. Most lakes with moraines at their outlets are partly\r\ndammed by outwash or rock ridges. One of the prominent examples is\r\nJosephine Lake near Many Glacier Hotel. The moraine which is partly\r\nresponsible for the lake is a hill which can be seen from Many Glacier\r\nHotel. Several of the large lakes on the west side of the Park are also\r\nheld partly or entirely by moraines.\r\n\r\nAnother type of moraine lake, which occurs only at Sperry and Grinnell\r\nGlaciers, has already been mentioned. It differs from all other Park\r\nlakes in having a glacier for part of its shoreline. There are two of\r\nthese lakes at Sperry and one at Grinnell. Despite their small size,\r\nthey are tremendously interesting, not only because of their relation to\r\nthe glacier, but also because they are ordinarily filled with icebergs\r\nthroughout the summer. Their surfaces often remain frozen until\r\nmid-summer.\r\n\r\nThere are several types of minor importance, the principal one of which\r\nis that formed by a landslide damming the valley.\r\n\r\nOne cannot remain long in Glacier National Park without noticing the\r\nvarying colors of its lake waters. In fact this feature is so striking\r\nthat ranger-naturalists probably are questioned more about it than about\r\nany other feature or phenomenon. To find the answer we must go again, as\r\nin so many instances, to the glaciers. As the ice moves it continually\r\nbreaks rock fragments loose. Some of these are ground into powder as\r\nthey move against each other and against the bedrock under the glacier.\r\nMost types of rock, especially the limestones and shales on which the\r\nPark glaciers rest, when ground fine enough yield a gray powder. All\r\nmelt-water streams issuing from glaciers are cloudy or milky from their\r\nload of this finely ground “rock flour.”\r\n\r\nWater from Grinnell Glacier is so laden with rock flour that the small\r\nlake along the edge of the ice into which the water pours is nearly\r\nwhite. Much of the silt is deposited in this lake, but enough is carried\r\ndownstream to give Grinnell Lake a beautiful turquoise hue. Some of the\r\nvery finest sediment which fails to settle in Grinnell Lake is carried a\r\nmile farther to Josephine Lake to give it a blue-green color. Even\r\nSwiftcurrent Lake, still farther downstream, does not contain clear\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe rock flour which colors these as well as other Park lakes can also\r\nbe seen in the streams. Baring Creek at Sunrift Gorge (see p. 13 in\r\nMotorist’s Guide) is milky with powdered rock from Sexton Glacier.\r\nCataract Creek along the trail between Josephine and Grinnell Lakes is\r\nnoticeably milky, extraordinarily so in mid-afternoon on very warm days.\r\nAt such times melting of the glaciers is accelerated and more silt is\r\nthen supplied to the streams.\r\n\r\nPart of Sperry Glacier, in contrast to Grinnell, rests on a bright red\r\nshaly rock (known to the geologists as argillite) which yields a\r\nred-gray powder when finely ground. Hence the water in several small\r\nlakes adjacent to the glacier has a pinkish tint.\r\n\r\nAlthough a large number of Park streams are fed by glaciers there are\r\nmany others, particularly in the south and west sections, which have no\r\nice as their source. On a trail trip from Sunrift Gorge to Virginia\r\nFalls, one is certain to be impressed by the extreme clarity of the\r\nwater in Virginia Creek. For half a mile below the falls the trail\r\nfollows this cascading torrent from one crystal pool to another. So\r\nclear is the water that we are apt to mistake for wading pools places\r\nwhere the water may be five or more feet deep. Snyder Creek near Lake\r\nMcDonald Lodge nearly rivals Virginia Creek in clarity. The sources of\r\nthese two streams obviously are not melting glaciers.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it is evident that glaciers constitute\r\none of the principal controlling factors in the color of the water in\r\nPark streams and lakes. Where there are no ice masses streams are clear,\r\nand where glaciers occur the water possesses many shades varying from\r\nclear blue through turquoise to gray, and in rare cases even pink.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MORAINE NEAR GRINNELL GLACIER IS 120 FEET HIGH. THE\r\n    GLACIER EXTENDED NEARLY TO TOP OF MORAINE 50 YEARS AGO. (DYSON\r\n    PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nAlthough the former large glaciers of the Ice Age transported huge\r\namounts of rock debris down the valleys of the Park, the moraines which\r\nthey deposited are, as a rule, not conspicuous features of the\r\nlandscape. The Going-to-the-Sun Road, however, crosses several\r\naccumulations of moraine in which road cuts have been made. The road\r\ntraverses a number of such places along the shore of Lake McDonald.\r\nBecause of the large proportions of rock flour (clay) in these\r\naccumulations, the material continually slumps, sometimes sliding onto\r\nthe road surface. One of these cuts has been partly stabilized by a\r\nlattice-like framework of logs. The largest excavation in moraine along\r\nthe highway is located about three miles east of Logan Pass just below\r\nthe big loop where the road crosses Siyeh Creek. The surfaces of many\r\nboulders in this moraine are marked by grooves and scratches, imparted\r\nto them as they were scraped along the side of the valley by the glacier\r\n10,000 or more years ago.\r\n\r\nA small moraine is exposed along the exit road from the parking lot at\r\nMany Glacier Hotel. It contains a number of small red boulders, the\r\nsources of which are the red rock ledges in the mountains several miles\r\nup the Swiftcurrent Valley, plainly visible from the hotel.\r\n\r\nOne of these ancient moraines which has been eroded into a series of\r\nmounds (25 to 100 feet high) extends from Swiftcurrent Cabin Camp down\r\nthe valley on the north side of the road to a point near the entrance to\r\nMany Glacier Ranger Station. Some of the cabins are actually situated in\r\na space between two of the highest mounds.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOOKING SOUTH ALONG THE GRINNELL GLACIER ICE FRONT.\r\n    NOTE CREVASSES ALONG WHICH BERGS ARE BREAKING OFF. (DYSON PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nSurrounding all existing Park glaciers are two sets of recent moraines\r\nvarying in height from a few feet to more than two hundred. So recently\r\n(probably 800 to 900 years) have the glaciers withdrawn from the older\r\nof these that only sparse willows and other forms of dwarf vegetation\r\nare growing on them.\r\n\r\nThe younger set of moraines, which has accumulated during the last\r\nseveral hundred years, consists of unweathered rock on which only small\r\npioneer plants and lichens have begun to establish themselves. These\r\nmoraines are particularly striking at Grinnell, Sperry, Blackfoot,\r\nAgassiz and Sexton Glaciers. On the last few yards of the spectacular\r\nGrinnell Glacier trail all persons who make the trip to the glacier must\r\nclimb over the moraine before setting foot on the ice. From this vantage\r\npoint on the highest part of this moraine the visitor can look down upon\r\na huge crevassed mass of ice lying in a stupendous rock-walled\r\namphitheater, then merely by facing the opposite direction, he will see\r\nunfolded before his view one of the most colorful vistas in the Park.\r\nMore than a thousand feet below in the head of a splendid U-shaped\r\nvalley lies the turquoise gem of Grinnell Lake. A mile farther away the\r\nblue surface of Lake Josephine stands out in sharp contrast to the dark\r\ngreen of the spruce which lines its shores. High above he can see the\r\nred summit of Mount Allen carrying its white snowbanks into the deep\r\nblue of a Montana sky. Despite this magnificence the visitor must soon\r\nturn his attention to the tremendous accumulation upon which he stands,\r\nfor it is no less interesting than the mountains and lakes. Among the\r\nmany boulders which lie along the path are two prominent limestone\r\nblocks each 10 to 15 feet in diameter. The underside of one was grooved\r\nand polished as the ice pushed it across the rock surface underlying the\r\nglacier. The other, partially embedded in the moraine, has a polished\r\nupper surface because the glacier flowed over it for a time. Both these\r\nboulders, although now nearly 300 yards from the ice front, were covered\r\nby the glacier until about 20 years ago.\r\n\r\nBecause of shrinkage many of the glaciers are no longer in contact with\r\nthese newer moraines. In some cases a quarter of a mile of bare rock\r\nsurface intervenes between the moraine and the glacier which made it.\r\n\r\nA few glaciers have disappeared within recent years, but their moraines\r\nremain as evidence of former glacier activity. One of the most notable\r\nexamples is afforded by Clements Glacier, a small body of ice which\r\nexisted until about 1938 in the shadow of Clements Mountain at Logan\r\nPass. Its edge was bordered by a ridge-like moraine nearly a hundred\r\nfeet high. Today, the trail from Logan Pass to Hidden Lake skirts the\r\noutside edge of the moraine. Should the hiker leave the trail and climb\r\nthe few yards to the top of this moraine he could see it stretched out\r\nbefore him as a giant necklace encircling the base of Clements Mountain,\r\nbut between mountain and moraine, where a few years ago the glacier lay,\r\nhe will see only bare rock or drifted snow.\r\n\r\nDespite recent rapid shrinkage of glaciers and the disappearance of\r\nsome, Glacier National Park still is a land of ice, yet when the visitor\r\nviews its present day glaciers and its sublimely beautiful mountain\r\nscenery he should not be unmindful of the powerful forces which, working\r\nduring many thousands of years, have brought it all about. Then, and\r\nonly then, can he properly appreciate the magnificence which Nature has\r\nso generously bestowed upon us.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CLEMENTS MOUNTAIN AND GLACIER.
