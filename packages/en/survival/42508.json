NIMMO\r\n  14, KING WILLIAM STREET, STRAND\r\n  1890\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Travellers see strange things,” more especially when their writing\r\nabout, or delineation of, them is not put under the microscope of modern\r\nscientific examination. Our ancestors were content with what was given\r\nthem, and being, as a rule, a stay-at-home race, they could not confute\r\nthe stories they read in books. That age of faith must have had its\r\ncomforts, for no man could deny the truth of what he was told. But now\r\nthat modern travel has subdued the globe, and inquisitive strangers have\r\npoked their noses into every portion of the world, “the old order\r\nchangeth, giving place to new,” and, gradually, the old stories are\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nIt is to rescue some of them from the oblivion into which they were fast\r\nfalling, that I have written, or compiled, this book. I say compiled it,\r\nfor I am fonder of letting old authors tell their stories in their\r\nold-fashioned language, than to paraphrase it, and usurp the credit of\r\ntheir writings, as is too much the mode now-a-days.\r\n\r\nIt is not given to every one to be able to consult the old Naturalists;\r\nand, besides, most of them are written in Latin, and to read them\r\nthrough is partly unprofitable work, as they copy so largely one from\r\nanother. But, for the general reader, selections can be made, and, if\r\nassisted by accurate reproductions of the very quaint wood engravings, a\r\nbook may be produced which, I venture to think, will not prove tiring,\r\neven to a superficial reader.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest wonders of the creation, and the strangest forms of\r\nbeing, have been met with in the sea; and as people who only\r\noccasionally saw them were not draughtsmen, but had to describe the\r\nmonsters they had seen on their return to land, their effigies came to\r\nbe exceedingly marvellous, and unlike the originals. The Northern Ocean,\r\nespecially, was their abode, and, among the Northern nations, tales of\r\nKraken, Sea-Serpents, Whirlpools, Mermen, &c., &c., lingered long after\r\nthey were received with doubt by other nations; but perhaps the most\r\ncredulous times were the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when no\r\ntravellers’ tales seem too gross for belief, as can well be seen in the\r\nextreme popularity, throughout all Europe, of the “Voyages and Travels\r\nof Sir John Maundeville,” who, though he may be a myth, and his\r\nso-called writings a compilation, yet that compilation represented the\r\nsum of knowledge, both of Geography, and Natural History, of countries\r\nnot European, that was attainable in the first half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAll the old Naturalists copied from one another, and thus compiled\r\ntheir writings. Pliny took from Aristotle, others quote Pliny, and so\r\non; but it was reserved for the age of printing to render their writings\r\navailable to the many, as well as to represent the creatures they\r\ndescribe by pictures (“the books of the unlearned”), which add so much\r\npiquancy to the text.\r\n\r\nMine is not a learned disquisition. It is simply a collection of\r\nzoological curiosities, put together to suit the popular taste of\r\nto-day, and as such only should it be critically judged.\r\n\r\n    JOHN

with the noblest of\r\ncreated beings, Man; and, if we may believe Darwin, he must have gone\r\nthrough many phases, and gradual mutations, before he arrived at his\r\npresent proud position of Master and Conqueror of the World.\r\n\r\nThis philosopher does not assign a high place in the animal creation to\r\nproud man’s protogenitor, and we ought almost to feel thankful to him\r\nfor not going further back. He begins with man as an Ascidian, which is\r\nthe lowest form of anything of a vertebrate character, with which we are\r\nacquainted; and he says thus, in his “Descent of Man”:--\r\n\r\n“The most ancient progenitors in the kingdom of the Vertebrata, at which\r\nwe are able to obtain an obscure glance, apparently consisted of a group\r\nof marine animals, resembling the larvæ of existing Ascidians. These\r\nanimals probably gave rise to a group of fishes, as lowly organised as\r\nthe lancelet; and from these the Ganoids, and other fishes like the\r\nLepidosiren, must have been developed. From such fish a very small\r\nadvance would carry us on to the amphibians. We see that birds and\r\nreptiles were once intimately connected together; and the Monotremata\r\nnow, in a slight degree, connect mammals with reptiles. But no one can,\r\nat present, say by what line of descent the three higher, and related\r\nclasses--namely, mammals, birds, and reptiles, were derived from either\r\nof the two lower vertebrate classes, namely, amphibians, and fishes. In\r\nthe class of mammals the steps are not difficult to conceive which led\r\nfrom the ancient Monotremata to the ancient Marsupials; and from these\r\nto the early progenitors of the placental mammals. We may thus ascend to\r\nthe Lemuridæ; and the interval is not wide from these to the Simiadæ.\r\nThe Simiadæ then branched off into two great stems, the New World, and\r\nOld World monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote period, Man, the\r\nwonder and glory of the Universe, proceeded.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“We have thus far endeavoured rudely to trace the genealogy of the\r\nVertebrata, by the aid of their mutual affinities. We will now look to\r\nman as he exists; and we shall, I think, be able partially to restore\r\nduring successive periods, but not in order of time, the structure of\r\nour early progenitors. This can be effected by means of the rudiments\r\nwhich man still retains, by the characters which occasionally make their\r\nappearance in him through reversion, and by the aid of morphology and\r\nembryology. The various facts to which I shall here allude, have been\r\ngiven in the previous chapters. The early progenitors of man were no\r\ndoubt once covered with hair, both sexes having beards; their ears were\r\npointed and capable of movement; and their bodies were provided with a\r\ntail, having the proper muscles. Their limbs and bodies were also acted\r\non by many muscles, which now only occasionally reappear, but are\r\nnormally present in the Quadrumana.... The foot, judging from the great\r\ntoe in the fœtus, was then prehensile; and our progenitors, no doubt,\r\nwere arboreal in their habits, frequenting some warm, forest-clad land.\r\nThe males were provided with great canine teeth, which served them as\r\nformidable weapons.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, as Mortimer Collins satirically, yet amusingly, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “There was an APE, in the days that were earlier;\r\n    Centuries passed, and his hair became curlier,\r\n    Centuries more gave a thumb to his wrist,--\r\n    Then he was MAN, and a POSITIVIST.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration, which seems to embody all the\r\nrequirements of Darwin, as representing our maternal progenitor, is from\r\nan old book by Joannes Zahn, published in 1696--and there figures as\r\n“Ourani Outains.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDarwin says that the men of the period wore tails, and if they were no\r\nlonger than that in this illustration (which is copied from the same\r\nbook), they can hardly be said to be unbecoming--still that is a matter\r\nfor taste--they are certainly more graceful than if they had been\r\nrat-like, or like a greyhound, or toy terrier. Many old authors speak of\r\ntailed men in Borneo and Java, and not only were men so adorned, but\r\nwomen. Peter Martyr says that in a region called Inzaganin, there is a\r\ntailed race--these laboured under the difficulty of being unable to move\r\nthem like animals--but as he observes, they were stiff like those of\r\nfishes and crocodiles--so much so, that when they wanted to sit down,\r\nthey had to use seats with holes in them.\r\n\r\nPtolemy and Ctesias speak of them, and Pliny says there were men in\r\nCeylon who had long hairy tails, and were of remarkable swiftness of\r\nfoot. Marco Polo tells us: “Now you must know that in this kingdom of\r\nLambri[1] there are men with tails; these tails are of a palm in length,\r\nand have no hair on them. These people live in the mountains, and are a\r\nkind of wild men. Their tails are about the thickness of a dog’s.” Many\r\nmodern travellers have heard of hairy and tailed people in the Malay\r\nArchipelago, and Mr. St. John, writing of Borneo, says that he met with\r\na trader who had seen and felt the tails of a race which inhabited the\r\nnorth-east coast of the island. These tails were about four inches long,\r\nand so stiff that they had to use perforated seats. The Chinese also\r\ndeclare that in the mountains above Canton there is a race of tailed\r\nmen. M. de Couret wrote about the Niam Niams, tailed men, who, he says,\r\nare living in Abyssinia or Nubia, having tails at least two inches long.\r\nWe all know the old Lord Monboddo’s theory that mankind had originally\r\ntails--nay, he went further, and said that some were born with them\r\nnow--a fact which will be partially borne out by any military medical\r\ninspecting officer, who in the course of his practice has met with men\r\nwhose “os coccygis” has been prolonged, so as to form a pseudo tail,\r\nwhich would unfit the man for the cavalry, although he would still be\r\nefficient as an infantry soldier.\r\n\r\nHere is a very fine picture from a fresco at Pompeii representing tailed\r\nmen, or, maybe, æsthetic young Fauns, treading out the vintage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut tailed men are as nothing, compared to the wonderful beings that\r\npeopled the earth in bygone times. It seems a pity that there are none\r\nof them now living, and that, consequent upon never having seen them, we\r\nare apt to imagine that they never existed, but were simply the\r\ncreatures of the writer’s brain. They were articles of belief until\r\ncomparatively recent times, and were familiar in Queen Elizabeth’s time,\r\nas we learn from Othello’s defence of himself (Act i. sc. 3):--\r\n\r\n    “And of the Cannibals that each other eat,\r\n    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\r\n    Do grow beneath their shoulders.”\r\n\r\nThey were thoroughly believed in, a century or two previously, in\r\nconnection with Geography, and, in the “Mappa Mundi” (one of the\r\nearliest preserved English maps), now in Hereford Cathedral, which dates\r\nfrom the very early part of the fourteenth century, nearly the whole of\r\nthe fanciful men hereafter mentioned are pourtrayed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSluper, who wrote in 1572, gives us the accompanying picture of a\r\nCyclope, with the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n    “De Polipheme & de Ciclopiens\r\n    Tout mention Poetes anciens:\r\n    On dit encor que ce lignage dure\r\n    Auec vn oeil selon ceste figure.”\r\n\r\nPliny places the Cyclopes “in the very centre of the earth, in Italy\r\nand Sicily;” and very likely there they might have existed, if we can\r\nbring ourselves to believe the very plausible explanation that they were\r\nminers, whose lanthorn, or candle, stuck in cap, was their one eye. At\r\nall events we may consider Sluper’s picture as somewhat of a fancy\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nAmong the Scythians, inhabiting the country beyond the Palus Mæotis, was\r\na tribe which Herodotus (although he has been christened “The father of\r\nlies”) did not believe in, nor indeed in any one-eyed men, but Pliny,\r\nliving some 500 years after him, tells afresh the old story respecting\r\nthese wonderful human beings. “In the vicinity also of those who dwell\r\nin the northern regions, and not far from the spot from which the north\r\nwind arises, and the place which is called its cave, and is known by the\r\nname of Geskleithron,[2] the Arimaspi are said to exist, a nation\r\nremarkable for having but one eye, and that placed in the middle of the\r\nforehead. This race is said to carry on a perpetual warfare with the\r\nGriffins,[3] a kind of monster, with wings, as they are commonly\r\nrepresented, for the gold which they dig out of the mines, and which\r\nthese wild beasts retain, and keep watch over with a singular degree of\r\ncupidity, while the Arimaspi are equally desirous to get possession of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMilton mentions this tribe in “Paradise Lost,” Book 2.\r\n\r\n    “As when a Gryphon through the wilderness,\r\n    With winged course, o’er hill, or mossy dale,\r\n    Pursues the Arimaspian, who, by stealth,\r\n    Had from his wakeful custody purloin’d\r\n    The guarded gold.”\r\n\r\nBut there seems every probability that the story of the Gryphon was\r\ninvented by the goldfinders, in order to deter people from coming near\r\nthem, and interfering with their livelihood. There were, however,\r\nsmaller Arimaspians, which probably the Gryphons did not heed, for Pliny\r\ntells us about the little thieves of mice. “In gold mines, too, their\r\nstomachs are opened for this purpose, and some of the metal is always to\r\nbe found there, which they have pilfered, so great a delight do they\r\ntake in stealing!” Livy, also, twice mentions mice gnawing gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere were Anthropophagi--cannibals--as there are now, but, of course,\r\nthey then lacked the luxury of cold missionary--and there were, besides,\r\nmany wonderful beings. “Beyond the other Scythian Anthropophagi, there\r\nis a country called Abarimon, situate in a certain great valley of Mount\r\nImaus (_the Himalayas_), the inhabitants of which are a savage race,\r\nwhose feet are turned backwards, relatively to their legs; they possess\r\nwonderful velocity, and wander about indiscriminately with the wild\r\nbeasts. We learn from Beeton, whose duty it was to take the measurements\r\nof the routes of Alexander the Great, that this people cannot breathe in\r\nany climate except their own, for which reason it is impossible to take\r\nthem before any of the neighbouring kings; nor could any of them be\r\nbrought before Alexander himself.\r\n\r\nThe Anthropophagi, whom we have previously mentioned as dwelling ten\r\ndays’ journey beyond the Borysthenes (_the Dneiper_), according to the\r\naccount of Isogonus of Nicæa, were in the habit of drinking out of human\r\nskulls, and placing the scalps, with the hair attached, upon their\r\nbreasts, like so many napkins. The same author relates that there is, in\r\nAlbania, a certain race of men, whose eyes are of a sea-green colour,\r\nand who have white hair from their earliest childhood (_Albinos_), and\r\nthat these people see better in the night than in the day. He states\r\nalso that the Sauromatæ, who dwell ten days’ journey beyond the\r\nBorysthenes, only take food every other day.\r\n\r\nCrates of Pergamus relates, that there formerly existed in the vicinity\r\nof Parium, in the Hellespont (_Camanar, a town of Asia Minor_), a race\r\nof men whom he calls Ophiogenes, and that by their touch they were able\r\nto cure those who had been stung by serpents, extracting the poison by\r\nthe mere imposition of the hand. Varro tells us, that there are still a\r\nfew individuals in that district, whose saliva effectually cures the\r\nstings of serpents. The same, too, was the case with the tribe of the\r\nPsylli, in Africa, according to the account of Agatharcides; these\r\npeople received their name from Psyllus, one of their kings, whose tomb\r\nis in existence, in the district of the Greater Syrtes (_Gulf of\r\nSidra_). In the bodies of these people, there was, by nature, a certain\r\nkind of poison, which was fatal to serpents, and the odour of which\r\noverpowered them with torpor; with them it was a custom to expose\r\nchildren, immediately after their birth, to the fiercest serpents, and\r\nin this manner to make proof of the fidelity of their wives; the\r\nserpents not being repelled by such children as were the offspring of\r\nadultery. This nation, however, was almost entirely extirpated by the\r\nslaughter made of them, by the Nasamones, who now occupy their\r\nterritory. This race, however, still survives in a few persons, who are\r\ndescendants of those who either took to flight, or else were absent on\r\nthe occasion of the battle. The Marsi, in Italy, are still in possession\r\nof the same power, for which, it is said, they are indebted to their\r\norigin from the son of Circe, from whom they acquired it as a natural\r\nquality. But the fact is, that all men possess, in their bodies, a\r\npoison which acts upon serpents, and the human saliva, it is said, makes\r\nthem take to flight, as though they had been touched with boiling water.\r\nThe same substance, it is said, destroys them the moment it enters their\r\nthroat, and more particularly so, if it should be the saliva of a man\r\nwho is fasting.\r\n\r\nAbove the Nasamones (_living near the Gulf of Sidra_), and the Machlyæ,\r\nwho border upon them, are found, as we learn from Calliphanes, the\r\nnation of the Androgyni, a people who unite the two sexes in the same\r\nindividual, and alternately perform the functions of each. Aristotle\r\nalso states, that their right breast is that of a male, the left that of\r\na female.\r\n\r\nIsigonus and Nymphodorus inform us that there are, in Africa, certain\r\nfamilies of enchanters, who, by means of their charms, in form of\r\ncommendations, can cause cattle to perish, trees to wither, and infants\r\nto die. Isigonus adds, that there are, among the Triballi, and the\r\nIllyrii, some persons of this description, who, also, have the power of\r\nfascination with the eyes, and can even kill those on whom they fix\r\ntheir gaze for any length of time, more especially if their look denotes\r\nanger: the age of puberty is said to be particularly obnoxious to the\r\nmalign influence of such persons.\r\n\r\nA still more remarkable circumstance is, the fact that these persons\r\nhave two pupils in each eye. Apollonides says, that there are certain\r\nfemales of this description in Scythia, who are known as Bythiæ, and\r\nPhylarcus states that a tribe of the Thibii in Pontus, and many other\r\npersons as well, have a double pupil in one eye, and in the other the\r\nfigure of a horse. He also remarks, that the bodies of these persons\r\nwill not sink in water, even though weighed down by their garments.\r\nDamon gives an account of a race of people, not very much unlike them,\r\nthe Pharnaces of Æthiopia, whose perspiration is productive of\r\nconsumption to the body of every person that it touches. Cicero also,\r\none of our own writers, makes the remark, that the glance of all women\r\nwho have a double pupil is noxious.\r\n\r\nTo this extent, then, has nature, when she produced in man, in common\r\nwith the wild beasts, a taste for human flesh, thought fit to produce\r\npoisons as well in every part of his body, and in the eyes of some\r\npersons, taking care that there shall be no evil influence in existence,\r\nwhich was not to be found in the human body. Not far from Rome, in the\r\nterritory of the Falisci, a few families are found, who are known by the\r\nname of Hirpi. These people perform a yearly sacrifice to Apollo, on\r\nMount Soracte, on which occasion they walk over a burning pile of wood,\r\nwithout being scorched even. On this account, by virtue of a decree of\r\nthe Senate, they are always exempted from military service, and from all\r\nother public duties.\r\n\r\nSome individuals, again, are born with certain parts of the body endowed\r\nwith properties of a marvellous nature. Such was the case with King\r\nPyrrhus, the great toe of whose right foot cured diseases of the spleen,\r\nmerely by touching the patient. We are informed that this toe could not\r\nbe reduced to ashes together with the other portions of his body; upon\r\nwhich it was placed in a temple.\r\n\r\nIndia and the region of Æthiopia, more especially, abounds in wonders.\r\nIn India the largest of animals are produced; their dogs, for instance,\r\nare much bigger than those of any other country. The trees, too, are\r\nsaid to be of such vast height that it is impossible to send an arrow\r\nover them. This is the result of the singular fertility of the soil, the\r\nequable temperature of the atmosphere, and the abundance of water;\r\nwhich, if we are to believe what is said, are such, that a single fig\r\ntree (_the banyan tree_) is capable of affording shelter to a whole\r\ntroop of horse. The reeds here (_bamboos_) are of such enormous length,\r\nthat each portion of them, between the joints, forms a tube, of which a\r\nboat is made that is capable of holding three men. It is a well-known\r\nfact, that many of the people here are more than five cubits in\r\nheight.[4] These people never expectorate, are subject to no pains,\r\neither in the head, the teeth, and the eyes, and, rarely, in any other\r\nparts of the body; so well is the heat of the sun calculated to\r\nstrengthen the constitution.... According to the account of Megasthenes,\r\ndwelling upon a mountain called Nulo, there is a race of men who have\r\ntheir feet turned backwards, with eight toes on each foot.\r\n\r\nOn many of the mountains again, there is a tribe of men who have the\r\nheads of dogs, and clothe themselves with the skins of wild beasts.\r\nInstead of speaking, they bark; and, furnished with claws, they live by\r\nhunting, and catching birds. According to the story, as given by\r\nCtesias, the number of these people is more than a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand; and the same author tells us that there is a certain race in\r\nIndia, of which the females are pregnant once only in the course of\r\ntheir lives, and that the hair of the children becomes white the instant\r\nthey are born. He speaks also of another race of men who are known as\r\nMonocoli,[5] who have only one leg, but are able to leap with surprising\r\nagility. The same people are also called Sciapodæ,[6] because they are\r\nin the habit of lying on their backs, during the time of extreme heat,\r\nand protect themselves from the sun by the shade of their feet. These\r\npeople, he says, dwell not very far from the Troglodytæ (_dwellers in\r\ncaves_); to the west of whom again there is a tribe who are without\r\nnecks, and have eyes in their shoulders.[7]\r\n\r\nAmong the mountainous districts of the eastern parts of India, in what\r\nis called the country of the Catharcludi, we find the Satyr, an animal\r\nof extraordinary swiftness. These go sometimes on four feet, and\r\nsometimes walk erect; they have also the features of a human being. On\r\naccount of their swiftness, these creatures are never to be caught,\r\nexcept that they are aged, or sickly. Tauron gives the name of\r\nChoromandæ to a nation which dwells in the woods, and have no proper\r\nvoice. These people screech in a frightful manner; their bodies are\r\ncovered with hair, their eyes are of a sea-green colour, and their teeth\r\nlike those of a dog. Eudoxus tells us, that in the southern parts of\r\nIndia, the men have feet a cubit in length, while the women are so\r\nremarkably small that they are called Struthpodes.[8]\r\n\r\nMegasthenes places among the Nomades of India, a people who are called\r\nScyritæ. These have merely holes in their faces instead of nostrils, and\r\nflexible feet, like the body of the serpent. At the very extremity of\r\nIndia, on the eastern side, near the source of the river Ganges, there\r\nis the nation of the Astomi, a people who have no mouths; their bodies\r\nare rough and hairy, and they cover themselves with a down[9] plucked\r\nfrom the leaves of trees. These people subsist only by breathing, and by\r\nthe odours which they inhale through the nostrils. They support\r\nthemselves neither upon meat nor drink; when they go upon a long journey\r\nthey only carry with them various odoriferous roots and flowers, and\r\nwild apples, that they may not be without something to smell at. But an\r\nodour, which is a little more powerful than usual, easily destroys\r\nthem....\r\n\r\nIsogonus informs us that the Cyrni, a people of India, live to their\r\nfour-hundredth year; and he is of opinion that the same is the case also\r\nwith the Æthiopian Macrobii,[10] the Seræ, and the inhabitants of Mount\r\nAthos. In the case of these last, it is supposed to be owing to the\r\nflesh of vipers, which they use as food; in consequence of which they\r\nare free also from all noxious animals, both in their hair and their\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAccording to Onesicritus, in those parts of India where there is no\r\nshadow, the men attain the height of five cubits and two palms,[11] and\r\ntheir life is prolonged to one hundred and thirty years; they die\r\nwithout any symptoms of old age, and just as if they were in the middle\r\nperiod of life. Pergannes calls the Indians, whose age exceeds one\r\nhundred years, by the name of Gymnetæ;[12] but not a few authors style\r\nthem Macrobii. Ctesias mentions a tribe of them, known by the name of\r\nPandore, whose locality is in the valleys, and who live to their\r\ntwo-hundredth year; their hair is white in youth, and becomes black in\r\nold age. On the other hand, there are some people joining up to the\r\ncountry of the Macrobii, who never live beyond their fortieth year, and\r\ntheir females have children once only during their lives. This\r\ncircumstance is also mentioned by Agatharchides, who states, in\r\naddition, that they live on locusts, and are very swift of foot.\r\nClitarchus and Megasthenes give these people the name of Mandi, and\r\nenumerate as many as three hundred villages which belong to them. Their\r\nwomen are capable of bearing children in the seventh year of their age,\r\nand become old at forty.\r\n\r\nArtemidorus states that in the island of Taprobane (_Ceylon_) life is\r\nprolonged to an extreme length, while at the same time, the body is\r\nexempt from weakness. Among the Calingæ, a nation also of India, the\r\nwomen conceive at five years of age, and do not live beyond their eighth\r\nyear. In other places again, there are men born with long hairy tails,\r\nand of remarkable swiftness of foot; while there are others that have\r\nears so large as to cover the whole body.\r\n\r\nCrates of Pergamus states, that the Troglodytæ, who dwell beyond\r\nÆthiopia, are able to outrun the horse; and that a tribe of the\r\nÆthiopians, who are known as the Syrbotæ, exceed eight cubits in height\r\n(_twelve feet_). There is a tribe of Æthiopian Nomades dwelling on the\r\nbanks of the river Astragus, towards the north, and about twenty days’\r\njourney from the ocean. These people are called Menismini; they live on\r\nthe milk of the animal which we call cynocephalus (_baboon_), and rear\r\nlarge flocks of these creatures, taking care to kill the males, except\r\nsuch as they may preserve for the purposes of breeding. In the deserts\r\nof Africa, men are frequently seen to all appearance, and then vanish in\r\nan instant.”[13]\r\n\r\nIt may be said that these descriptions of men are only the belief about\r\nthe time of the Christian era, when Pliny lived--but it was the faith of\r\ncenturies, and we find, 1200 years after Pliny died, Sir John Mandeville\r\nconfirming his statements, and, as before stated, these wondrous\r\ncreatures were given in illustrations, both in the Mappa Mundi, and in\r\nearly printed books. Mandeville writes: “Many divers countreys &\r\nkingdoms are in Inde, and it is called Inde, of a river that runneth\r\nthrough it, which is called Inde also, and there are many precious\r\nstones in that river Inde. And in that ryver men finde Eles of xxx foote\r\nlong, & men y^t dwell nere that river are of evill colour, yelowe &\r\ngrene....\r\n\r\n“Then there is another yle that men call Dodyn, & it is a great yle. In\r\nthis yle are maner diverse of men y^t have evyll maners, for the father\r\neateth the son, & the son the father, the husband his wyfe, and the wyfe\r\nhir husbande. And if it so be that the father be sicke, or the mother,\r\nor any frend, the sonne goeth soone to the priest of the law & prayeth\r\nhim that he will aske of the ydoll if his father shall dye of that\r\nsicknesse, or not. And then the priest and the son kneele down before\r\nthe ydole devoutly, & asketh him, and he answereth to them, and if he\r\nsay that he shall lyve, then they kepe him wel, and if he say that he\r\nshall dye, then commeth the priest with the son, or with the wyfe, or\r\nwhat frende that it be unto him y^t is sicke, and they lay their hands\r\nover his mouth to stop his breath, & so they sley him, & then they smite\r\nall the body into peces, & praieth all his frendes for to come and eate\r\nof him that is dead, and they make a great feste thereof, and have many\r\nminstrels there, and eate him with great melody. And so when they have\r\neaten al y^e flesh, then they take the bones, and bury them all singing\r\nwith great worship, and all those that are of his frendes that were not\r\nat the eating of him, have great shame and vylany, so that they shall\r\nnever more be taken as frends.\r\n\r\n“And the king of this yle is a great lord and mightie, & he hath under\r\nhim liii greate Yles, and eche of them hath a king; and in one of these\r\nyles are men that have but one eye, and that is in the middest of theyr\r\nfront, and they eat flesh & fishe all rawe. And in another yle dwell\r\nmen that have no heads, & theyr eyen are in theyr shoulders & theyr\r\nmouth is on theyr breste. In another yle are men that have no head ne\r\neyen, and their mouth is in theyr shoulders. And in another yle are men\r\nthat have flatte faces, without nose, and without eyen, but they have\r\ntwo small round holes in stede of eyen, and they have a flatte mouth\r\nwithout lippes. And in that yle are men that have their faces all flat\r\nwithout eyen, without mouth & without nose, but they have their eyen,\r\nand their mouth, behinde on their shoulders.\r\n\r\n“And in another yle are foule men that have the lippes about the mouth\r\nso greate, that when they sleepe in the sonne they cover theyr face with\r\nthe lippe. And in another yle are little men, as dwarfes, and have no\r\nmouth, but a lyttle rounde hole & through that hole they eate their\r\nmeate with a pipe, & they have no tongue, & they speake not, but they\r\nblow & whistle, and so make signes one to another. And in another yle\r\nare wild men with hanging eares unto their shoulders. And in another yle\r\nare wild men, with hanging eares & have feete lyke an hors & they run\r\nfaste, & they take wild beastes, and eate them. And in another yle are\r\nmen that go on theyr handes & feete lyke beasts & are all rough, and\r\nwill leape upon a tree like cattes or apes. And in another yle are men\r\nthat go ever uppon theyr knees marvaylosly, and have on every foote viii\r\nToes....\r\n\r\n“There is another yle that men call Pitan, men of this lande till no\r\nlande, for they eate nought, and they are smal, but not so smal as\r\nPigmes. These men live with smell of wild aples, & when they go far out\r\nof the countrey, they beare apples with them, for anon, as they lose\r\nthe savour of apples they dye--they are not reasonable, but as wyld\r\nbeastes. And there is another yle where the people are all fethers,[14]\r\nbut the face and the palmes of theyr handes, these men go as well about\r\nthe sea, as on the lande, and they eate flesh and fish all raw.... In\r\nEthiope are such men that have but one foote, and they go so fast y^t it\r\nis a great marvaill, & that is a large fote, that the shadow thereof\r\ncovereth y^e body from son or rayne, when they lye upon their backes;\r\nand when their children be first borne they loke like russet, and when\r\nthey waxe olde then they be all black.”\r\n\r\nThere were also elephant-headed men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the olden times were men who did not build themselves houses--but\r\nsheltered themselves in caves, fissures of rocks, &c., and many are the\r\nremains we find of their flint implements, and the bones, which they\r\nused to split in order to extract the marrow of the animals they had\r\nslain with their rude flint arrows and spears. These, in classical\r\ntimes, were called Troglodytes (from the Greek τρωγλοδὺται, _dwellers in\r\ncaves_). It was a generic term, although particularly applied to\r\nuncivilised races on the banks of the Danube--those who dwelt on the\r\nwestern coasts of the Red Sea--and Ethiopia. These latter could not have\r\nled a particularly happy life, for Herodotus tells us that the\r\n“Garamantes hunt the Ethiopian Troglodytes in four horse chariots; for\r\nthe Ethiopian Troglodytes are the swiftest of foot of all men of whom we\r\nhave heard any account given. The Troglodytes feed upon serpents and\r\nlizards, and such kind of reptiles; they speak a language like no other,\r\nbut screech like bats.”\r\n\r\nPliny, as we have seen, speaks of an adder eating people, whose food\r\nenables them to achieve extraordinary longevity, and Mandeville tells us\r\nthat “From this yle, men go to an yle that is called Tracota, where all\r\nmen are as beastes, & not reasonable, they dwell in caves, for they have\r\nnot wyt to make them houses--they eate adders, and they speake not, but\r\nthey make such a noyse as adders doe one to another, and they make no\r\nforce of ryches, but of a stone that hath forty colours, and it is\r\ncalled Traconyt after that yle, they know not the vertue thereof, but\r\nthey covete it for the great fayreness.”\r\n\r\nThis stone was probably some kind of agate. It could not possibly have\r\nbeen a topaz, as some have thought, as the context from Pliny will show.\r\n“Topazos is a stone that is still held in very high estimation for its\r\ngreen tints; indeed, when first it was discovered, it was preferred to\r\nevery other kind of precious stone. It so happened that some Troglodytic\r\npirates, suffering from tempest and hunger, having landed upon an island\r\noff the coast of Arabia, known as Cytis, when digging there for roots\r\nand grass, discovered this precious stone; such, at least, is the\r\nopinion expressed by Archelaüs. Juba says that there is an island in\r\nthe Red Sea called _Topazos_, at a distance of three hundred stadia\r\nfrom the mainland; that it is surrounded by fogs, and is often sought by\r\nnavigators in consequence; and that, to this, it received its present\r\nname, the word _Topazin_[15] meaning “to seek” in the language of the\r\nTroglodytæ.... At a later period a statue, four cubits in height, was\r\nmade of this stone.... Topazos is the largest of all the precious\r\nstones.”\r\n\r\nThis shows that the Troglodytæ of Ethiopia had some commercial energy,\r\nand they did a good trade in myrrh and other condiments. Pliny says that\r\nthe Troglodytæ traded among other things in cinnamon. They “after buying\r\nit of their neighbours, carry it over vast tracts of sea, upon rafts,\r\nwhich are neither steered by rudder nor drawn or impelled by oars or\r\nsails. Nor yet are they aided by any of the resources of art, man alone,\r\nand his daring boldness, standing in the place of all these; in addition\r\nto which, they choose the winter season, about the time of the equinox,\r\nfor their voyage, for then a south-easterly wind is blowing; these winds\r\nguide them in a straight course from gulf to gulf, and after they have\r\ndoubled the promontory of Arabia, the north-east wind carries them to a\r\nport of the Gebanitæ, known by the name of Ocilia. Hence it is that they\r\nsteer for this port in preference, and they say that it is almost five\r\nyears before the merchants are able to effect their return, while many\r\nperish on the voyage. In return for their wares, they bring back\r\narticles of glass and copper, cloths, buckles, bracelets, and necklaces;\r\nhence it is that this traffic depends more particularly upon the\r\ncapricious tastes and inclinations of the female sex.”\r\n\r\nThis shows that some, at least, of the Troglodytes had a commercial\r\nspirit, and were in a comparative state of civilisation; in fact the\r\nlatter is thoroughly proved, when, a little later on, Pliny speaks of\r\nMyrobalanum, “Among these various kinds, that which is sent from the\r\ncountry of the Troglodytæ is the worst of all,” thus showing that they\r\nhad reached the civilised pitch of adulteration! There are also several\r\nnotices of peculiarities connected with this people, which deserve a\r\npassing glance. They had turtles with horns (or more probably fore-feet)\r\nwhich resembled the branches of a lyre; with these they swam. These were\r\nin all likelihood the tortoise-shell turtles, for they called them\r\n_Chelyon_. The Troglodytæ worshipped them. Their cattle were not like\r\nother oxen, for their horns pointed downwards to the ground, so that\r\nthey were obliged to feed with their heads on one side. These oxen\r\nshould have been crossed with those of Phrygia, whose horns were as\r\nmobile as their ears. And they were the happy possessors of a lake,\r\ncalled the _Unhealthy Lake_, which thrice a day became salt and bitter,\r\nand then again fresh, and this went on both day and night. We can hardly\r\nwonder that this _Lacus Insanus_ was full of white serpents thirty feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMAZONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe race of Amazons or fighting women, is not yet extinct, as the\r\nchronicles of every police court can tell, and as an organised body of\r\nwarlike soldiers--the King of Dahomey still keeps them up, or did until\r\nvery recently. According to Herodotus, the Greeks, after having routed\r\nthe Amazons, sailed away in three ships, taking with them as many\r\nAmazons, as they had been able to capture alive--but, when fairly out at\r\nsea, the ladies arose, stood up for women’s rights, and cut all the\r\nGreeks in pieces. But they had not reckoned on one little thing, and\r\nthat was, that none among them had the slightest idea of navigation;\r\nthey couldn’t even steer or row--so they had to drift about, until they\r\ncame to Cremni (supposed to be near _Taganrog_), which was Scythian\r\nterritory. They signalised their landing by horse-stealing, and the\r\nScythians, not appreciating the joke, gave them battle, thinking they\r\nwere men; but an examination of the dead proved them to be of the other\r\nsex. On learning this, the Scythians were far too gentlemanly to\r\ncontinue the strife, and, little by little, they established the most\r\nfriendly relations with the Amazons. These ladies, however, objected to\r\ngo to the Scythians’ homes, for, as they pertinently put it, “We never\r\ncould live with the women of your county, because we have not the same\r\ncustoms with them. We shoot with the bow, throw the javelin, and ride on\r\nhorseback, and have never learnt the employments of women. But your\r\nwomen do none of the things we have mentioned, but are engaged in\r\nwomen’s work, remaining in their wagons, and do not go out to hunt, or\r\nanywhere else; we could not therefore consort with them. If, then, you\r\ndesire to have us for your wives, and to prove yourselves honest men, go\r\nto your parents, claim your share of their property, then return, and\r\nlet us live by ourselves.”\r\n\r\nThis the young Scythians did, but, when they returned, the Amazons said\r\nthey were afraid to stop where they were, for they had deprived parents\r\nof their sons, and besides, had committed depredations in the country,\r\nso that they thought it but prudent to leave, and suggested that they\r\nshould cross the Tanais, or _Don_, and found a colony on the other side.\r\nThis their husbands acceded to, and when they were settled, their wives\r\nreturned to their old way of living--hunting, going to war with their\r\nhusbands, and wearing the same clothes--in fact they enjoyed an actual\r\nexistence, of which many women nowadays, fondly, but vainly dream. There\r\nwas a little drawback however--the qualification for a young lady’s\r\npresentation at court, consisted of killing a man, and, until that was\r\neffected, she could not marry.\r\n\r\nSir John Mandeville of course knew all about them, although he does not\r\npretend to have seen them, and this is what he tells us. “After the land\r\nof Caldee, is the land of Amazony, that is a land where there is no man\r\nbut all women, as men say, for they wil suffer no man to lyve among\r\nthem, nor to have lordeshippe over them. For sometyme was a kinge in\r\nthat lande, and men were dwelling there as did in other countreys, and\r\nhad wives, & it befell that the kynge had great warre with them of\r\nSychy, he was called Colopius, and he was slaine in bataill and all the\r\ngood bloude of his lande. And this Queene, when she herd that, & other\r\nladies of that land, that the king and the lordes were slaine, they\r\ngathered them togither and killed all the men that were lefte in their\r\nlande among them, and sithen that time dwelled no man among them.\r\n\r\n“And when they will have any man, they sende for them in a countrey that\r\nis nere theyr lande, and the men come, and are ther viii dayes, or as\r\nthe woman lyketh, & then they go againe, and if they have men children\r\nthey send them to theyr fathers, when they can eate & go, and if they\r\nhave maide chyldren they kepe them, and if they bee of gentill bloud\r\nthey brene[16] the left pappe[17] away, for bearing of a shielde, and,\r\nif they be of little bloud, they brene the ryght pappe away for shoting.\r\nFor those women of that countrey are good warriours, and are often in\r\nsoudy[18] with other lordes, and the queene of that lande governeth well\r\nthat lande; this lande is all environed with water.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPYGMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe antitheses of men--Dwarfs, and Giants--must not be overlooked, as\r\nthey are abnormal, and yet have existed in all ages. Dwarfs are\r\nmentioned in the Bible, _Leviticus_ xxi. 20, where following the\r\ninjunction of “Let him not approach to offer the bread of his God”--are\r\nmentioned the “crookbackt or dwarf.” Dwarfs in all ages have been made\r\nthe sport of Royalty, and the wealthy; but it is not of them I write,\r\nbut of a race called the Pygmies, very small men who were descended from\r\nPygmæus. They are noted in the earliest classics, for even Homer\r\nmentions them in his Iliad (B. 3, l. 3-6), which Pope translates:--\r\n\r\n    “So, when inclement winter vex the plain\r\n    With piercing frosts, or thick descending rain,\r\n    To warmer seas, the Cranes embody’d fly,\r\n    With noise, and order, through the mid-way sky;\r\n    To pigmy nations, wounds and death they bring,\r\n    And all the war descends upon the wing.”\r\n\r\nHomer also wrote a poem, “Pygmæogeranomachia,” about the Pygmies and\r\nCranes. The accompanying illustration is from a fresco at Pompeii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAristotle says that they lived in holes under the earth, and came out in\r\nthe harvest time with hatchets, to cut down the corn, as if to fell a\r\nforest, and went on goats and lambs of proportionable stature to\r\nthemselves to make war against certain birds, called Cranes by some,\r\nwhich came there yearly from Scythia to plunder them. Pliny mentions\r\nthem several times, but especially in B. 7, c. 2. “Beyond these people,\r\nand at the very extremity of the mountains, the Trispithami,[19] and\r\nthe Pygmies are said to exist; two races, which are but three spans in\r\nheight, that is to say, twenty-seven inches only. They enjoy a\r\nsalubrious atmosphere, and a perpetual spring, being sheltered by the\r\nmountains from the northern blasts; it is these people that Homer has\r\nmentioned as being waged war upon by Cranes. It is said that they are in\r\nthe habit of going down every spring to the sea-shore, in a large body,\r\nseated on the backs of rams and goats, and armed with arrows, and there\r\ndestroy the eggs and the young of those birds; that this expedition\r\noccupies them for the space of three months, and that otherwise it would\r\nbe impossible for them to withstand the increasing multitudes of the\r\nCranes. Their cabins, it is said, are built of mud, mixed with feathers\r\nand egg shells.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMandeville thus describes them. “When men passe from that citie of\r\nChibens, they passe over a great river of freshe water, and it is nere\r\niiii mile brode, & then men enter into the lande of the great Caan. This\r\nriver goeth through the land of Pigmeens, and there men are of little\r\nstature, for they are but three span long, and they are right fayre,\r\nboth men and women, though they bee little, and they live but viii[20]\r\nyeare, and he that liveth viii yeare is holden right olde, and these\r\nsmall men are the best workemen in sylke, and of cotton, in all maner of\r\nthing that are in the worlde; and these smal men travail not, nor tyl\r\nland, but they have amonge them great men, as we are, to travaill for\r\nthem, & they have great scorne of those great men, as we would have of\r\ngiaunts, or, of them, if they were among us.”\r\n\r\nSer Marco Polo warns his readers against _pseudo_ Pygmies. Says he: “I\r\nmay tell you moreover that when people bring over pygmies which they\r\nallege to come from India, ’tis all a lie and a cheat. For those little\r\nmen, as they call them, are manufactured on this Island (_Sumatra_), and\r\nI will tell you how. You see there is on the Island a kind of monkey\r\nwhich is very small, and has a face just like a man’s. They take these,\r\nand pluck out all the hair, except the hair of the beard, and on the\r\nbreast, and then dry them, and stuff them, and daub them with saffron,\r\nand other things, until they look like men. But you see it is all a\r\ncheat; for nowhere in India, nor anywhere else in the world, were there\r\never men seen so small as these pretended pygmies.”\r\n\r\nBut there are much more modern mention of these small folk. Olaus Magnus\r\nnot only reproduces the classical story, but tells of the Pygmies of\r\nGreenland--the modern Esquimaux. These are also mentioned in Purchas his\r\nPilgrimage, as living in Iceland, “pigmies represent the most perfect\r\nshape of man; that they are hairy to the uttermost joynts of the\r\nfingers, and that the males have beards downe to the knees; but,\r\nalthough they have the shape of men, yet they have little sense or\r\nunderstanding, nor distinct speech, but make shew of a kinde of hissing,\r\nafter the manner of geese.”\r\n\r\nBut to bring the history of pygmies down to modern times--I quote from\r\n“Giants and Dwarfs,” by E. J. Wood, 1868, and I am thus particular in\r\ngiving my authority, as the news comes from America, whence, sometimes,\r\nfact is mixed with fiction (pp. 246, 247, 248). “It is alleged by\r\ncontemporary newspapers, that in 1828 several burying-grounds, from half\r\nan acre to an acre and a half in extent, were discovered in the county\r\nof White, state of Tennessee, near the town of Sparta, wherein very\r\nsmall people had been deposited in tombs or coffins of stone. The\r\ngreatest length of the skeletons was nineteen inches. The bones were\r\nstrong and well set, and the whole frames were well formed. Some of the\r\npeople appeared to have lived to a great age, their teeth being worn\r\nsmooth and short, while others were full and long. The graves were about\r\ntwo feet deep; the coffins were of stone, and made by laying a flat\r\nstone at the bottom, one at each side, or each end, and one over the\r\ncorpse. The dead were all buried with their heads toward the east, and\r\nin regular order, laid on their backs, and with their hands on their\r\nbreasts. In the bend of the left arm was found a cruse, or vessel, that\r\nwould hold nearly a pint, made of ground stone, or shell, of a grey\r\ncolour, in which were found two or three shells. One of these skeletons\r\nhad about its neck ninety-four pearl beads. Near one of these\r\nburying-places was the appearance of the site of an ancient town.\r\n\r\nWebber, in his ‘Romance of Natural History,’ refers to the diminutive\r\nsarcophagi found in Kentucky and Tennessee; and he describes these\r\nreceptacles to be about three feet in length, by eighteen inches deep,\r\nand constructed, bottom, sides, and top, of flat, unhewn stones. These\r\nhe conjectures to be the places of sepulture of a pigmy race, that\r\nbecame extinct at a period beyond reach even of the tradition of the\r\nso-called Indian aborigines.\r\n\r\nNewspapers for 1866 tell us that General Milroy, who had been spending\r\nmuch time in Smith County, Tennessee, attending to some mining business,\r\ndiscovered near Watertown in that county some remarkable graves, which\r\nwere disclosed by the washing of a small creek in its passage through a\r\nlow bottom. The graves were from eighteen inches to two feet in length,\r\nmost of them being of the smaller size, and were formed by an excavation\r\nof about fifteen inches below the surface, in which were placed four\r\nundressed slabs of rock--one in the bottom of the pit, one on each side,\r\nand one on the top. Human skeletons, some with nearly an entire skull,\r\nand many with well-defined bones, were found in them. The teeth were\r\nvery diminutive, but evidently those of adults. Earthen crocks were also\r\nfound with the skeletons. General Milroy could not gain any satisfactory\r\ninformation respecting these pigmy graves. The oldest inhabitants of the\r\nvicinity knew nothing of their origin or history, except that there was\r\na large number of similar graves near Statesville in the same county,\r\nand also a little burial-ground at the mouth of Stone River, near the\r\ncity of Nashville. General Milroy deposited the bones found by him in\r\nthe State Library at Nashville.”\r\n\r\nThat a race of dwarfs live in Central Africa, is now well known. Ronzo\r\nde Leo, who travelled in Africa, for many years with Dr. Livingstone, at\r\none time almost stood alone in his assertion of this fact. But he was\r\nsupported in his statement by G. Eugene Wolff, who had been in Central\r\nAfrica with Stanley, and he maintained that, on the southern branches of\r\nthe Congo, he had seen whole villages of Lilliputians, of whom the men\r\nwere not over four and a half feet high, whilst the women were a great\r\ndeal smaller. He described them as being both brave and cunning, expert\r\nwith bow and arrow, with which they readily bring down the African\r\nbison, antelope, and even elephants. As trappers of small animals they\r\nare unsurpassed. In a close pinch they use the lance with astonishing\r\ndexterity, and an ordinary sling, in their hands, is wielded with\r\nwonderful skill.\r\n\r\nThese dwarfs collect the sap of the palm, with which they make soap. The\r\nmen are smooth-faced, and of a rich mahogany colour, while the hair is\r\nshort, and as black as night. Tens of thousands of them live on the\r\nsouth branch of the Congo.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley in his expedition for the relief of Emin Pacha,[21]\r\nencountered some tribes of these pigmies, but he does not agree with the\r\naccount which Mr. Wolff gives of them, who describes them as an affable,\r\nkind-hearted people, of simple ways, and devoid of vicious tendencies to\r\na greater degree than most semi-barbaric races. The women are\r\nindustrious and amiable.\r\n\r\nStanley, on the contrary, found them very annoying, and had a lively\r\nrecollection of their poisoned arrows--but, at the present writing, he\r\nnot having returned, and we, having no record but his letters, had\r\nbetter suspend our judgment as to the habits and tempers of these small\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWolff says they stand in awe of their bigger neighbours, but are so\r\nbrave and cunning that, with all the odds of physique against them, the\r\npigmies are masters of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis last sentence seems almost a compendium of _The History of Tom\r\nThumb_, for his wit enabled him to overcome the lubber-headed giants, in\r\nevery conflict he was engaged in with them--they were no match for him.\r\nTake the Romances of Chivalry. Pacolet, and all the dwarfs, were endowed\r\nwith acute wits, and there was very little they could not compass--but\r\nthe giants! their ultimate fate was always to be slain by some knight,\r\nand their imprisoned knights and damsels set free. A dwarf was a cleanly\r\nliver, but a giant was turbulent, quarrelsome, lustful, and occasionally\r\ncannibal. Fe Fi Fo Fum was the type of colossal man, and, as it is quite\r\na pleasure to whitewash their characters in these respects, I hasten to\r\ndo so before further discoursing on the subject of these great men.\r\n\r\nIt is Olaus Magnus who thus tells us\r\n\r\n    “Of the sobriety of Giants and Champions.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“That most famous Writer of the _Danish_ affairs, _Saxo_, alleged\r\nbefore, and who shall be often alleged hereafter, saith, that amongst\r\nother mighty strong men in the _North_, who were as great as Giants,\r\nthere was one _Starchaterus Thavestus_, whose admirable and heroick\r\nVertues are so worthily extolled by him, that there were scarce any\r\nlike him in those dayes in all _Europe_, or in the whole World, or\r\nhardly are now, or ever shall be. And amongst other Vertues he ascribes\r\nto that high-spirited man, he mentions his sobriety, which is\r\nprincipally necessary for valiant men: and I thought fit to annex that\r\npeculiarly to this relation, that we may, as in a glass, see more\r\ncleerly the luxury of this lustful age. For, as the same _Saxo_\r\ntestifies, that valiant _Starchaterus_ loved frugality, and loved not\r\nimmoderate dainties. Alwayes neglecting pleasure, he respected Vertue,\r\nimitating the antient manner of Continency, and he desired a homely\r\nprovision of his Diet; he hated costly suppers; wherefore hating\r\nprofusion in Diet, and feeding on smoaked and rank meat, he drove away\r\nHunger, with the greater appetite, as his meat was but of one kind, lest\r\nhe should remit and abate the force of his true Vertue, by the contagion\r\nof outward Delights, as by some adulterate sweetness, or should abrogate\r\nthe Rule of antient Frugality, by unusual Superstitions for Gluttony.\r\nMoreover, he could not endure to spend rost and boyled meat all at one\r\nMeal; holding that to be a monstrous Food, that Cookery had tampered\r\nwith divers things together: Wherefore, that he might turn away the\r\nLuxury of the _Danes_, that they borrowed from the _Germans_, that made\r\nthem so effeminate, amongst the rest he made Verses in his Country\r\nLanguage.” Omitting many of them, he sang thus:\r\n\r\n    “_Starchaterus_ his Verses on _Frugality_.\r\n\r\n    “Strong men do love raw meat; nor do they need,\r\n    Or love, on dainty Cates and Feasts to feed,\r\n    War is the thing they most delight to breed,\r\n    You may sooner bite off their beards that are\r\n    Full hard, and stiff with bristled, rugged, hair,\r\n    Than their wide mouths leave Milk their daily fare:\r\n    We fly from dainty Kitchins, and do fill\r\n    Our Bellies with rank Meats, and Countray swill,\r\n    Of old, men fed on boyl’d Meats, ’gainst their will.\r\n    A dish of Grass, that had no smack, did hold\r\n    Hog’s and sheep’s flesh together, hot or cold,\r\n    Nor to pollute their meats with mingling were they bold;\r\n    He that eats Cream we bid him for to be\r\n    Strong, and to have a mind that’s bold and free.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Eleven Lords of elder time we were,\r\n    That waited on King Hachon, and at fare\r\n    _Helgo Begachus_ sat first in order there.\r\n    First dish he eat was a dry’d Gammon, and\r\n    A Crust as hard as Flint he took in hand,\r\n    This made his hungry, yawning stomach stand:\r\n    No man at Table fed on stinking meat,\r\n    But what was good and common, each man eat,\r\n    Content with simple fare, though nere so great;\r\n    The greatest were not Gluttons, nor yet fine,\r\n    The King himself full sparingly would dine.\r\n    No Drinks were used that did of Honey bost,\r\n    Beer was their common Liquor, _Ceres_ owest,\r\n    They fed on Meats were little boyl’d, no rost.\r\n    Each Table was with Meats but meanly drest,\r\n    Few Dishes on’t, Antiquity thought best;\r\n    And in plain Fare each held himself most blest.\r\n    There were no Flagons, nor broad Bowls in use,\r\n    Nor painted Dishes grown to great abuse,\r\n    Each, at the Tap, did fill his wooden cruze.\r\n    No man, admirer of the former days,\r\n    Did use Tankards or Oxeys;[22] for their ways\r\n    Were sparing, almost empty Dishes this bewrays.\r\n    No Silver Basons, or guilt Cups were thought\r\n    Fit by the Host, and to the table brought,\r\n    To garnish, or by Ghests were vainly sought.”\r\n\r\nBy precept, and example, he induced many to Temperance and\r\nSobriety--but, in spite of his moderation in food and drink, he was a\r\nmost outrageous pirate, and Berserker.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, old, and weary of life, he sought death, and meeting\r\nHatherus, son of a noble whom he had killed, begged him as a favour to\r\ncut his head off--and the young man, obligingly consenting, his head was\r\nsevered from his body, and literally bit the ground. There are records\r\nof many more Northern giants, but none of so edifying a life as\r\nStarchaterus.\r\n\r\nGiants are plentiful in the Bible, the Emins, Anakims, and the\r\nZamzummims: there was Og, King of Bashan, whose iron bedstead was 9\r\ncubits long by 4 broad--_i.e._, 13 ft. 6 in. by 6 ft. That redoubtable\r\nchampion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, was six cubits and a span\r\nhigh--_i.e._, 9 ft. 9 in. In 2 Samuel xxi. 15-22, we find mention made\r\nof many giants.\r\n\r\n“15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David\r\nwent down, and his servants with him, and fought against the\r\nPhilistines; and David waxed faint.\r\n\r\n“16 And Ishbi-benob, which was of the sons of the giants, the weight of\r\nwhose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being\r\ngirded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.\r\n\r\n“17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the\r\nPhilistine, and killed him....\r\n\r\n“18 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with\r\nthe Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which\r\nwas of the sons of the giant.\r\n\r\n“19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where\r\nElhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of\r\nGoliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.\r\n\r\n“20 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great\r\nstature, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he\r\nalso was born to the giant.\r\n\r\n“21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah, the brother\r\nof David, slew him.\r\n\r\n“22 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of\r\nDavid, and by the hand of his servants.”\r\n\r\nBut these were mere pigmies if we can believe M. Henrion, who in 1718\r\ncalculated out the heights of divers notable persons--thus he found Adam\r\nwas 121 ft. 9 in. high, Eve 118 ft. 9 in., Noah 27 ft., Abraham 20 ft.,\r\nand Moses 13 ft.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the mythical classical giants, Pliny says: “The tallest\r\nman that has been seen in our times, was one Gabbaras by name, who was\r\nbrought from Arabia by the Emperor Claudius; his height was nine feet\r\nand as many inches. In the reign of Augustus, there were two persons,\r\nPosio and Secundilla, by name, who were half a foot taller than him;\r\ntheir bodies have been preserved as objects of curiosity in the Museum\r\nof the Sallustian family.”\r\n\r\nBut it is reserved to Sir John Mandeville to have found the tallest\r\ngiants of, comparatively speaking, modern times. “And beyond that valey\r\nis a great yle, where people as great as giaunts of xxviii fote long,\r\nand they have no clothinge but beasts skyns that hang on them, and they\r\neate no bread, but flesh raw, and drink milke, and they have no houses,\r\n& they ate gladlyer fleshe of men, than other, & men saye to us that\r\nbeyonde that yle is an yle where are greater giaunts as xlv or l fote\r\nlong, & some said l cubits long (_75 feet_) but I saw them not, and\r\namong those giaunts are great shepe, and they beare great wolle, these\r\nshepe have I sene many times.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the antiquity of man it is impossible to speculate, because we have\r\nno data to go upon. We know that his earliest existence, of which we\r\nhave any cognisance, must have been at a period when the climate and\r\nfauna of the Western continent was totally different to their present\r\nstate. Then roamed over the land, the elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, the Bos-primigenius, the reindeer, the cave bear, the\r\nbrown and the Arctic bears, the cave hyæna, and many other animals now\r\nquite extinct. We know that man then existed, because we find his\r\nhandiwork in the shape of manufactured flint implements, mixed with the\r\nbones of these animals--and, occasionally, with them human remains have\r\nbeen found, but, as yet, no perfect skull has been found. There were two\r\ntypes of man, the Dolicho Cephalous, or long-headed, and the Brachy\r\nCephalous, or round-headed--and, of these, the long-headed were of far\r\ngreater antiquity.\r\n\r\nAll we can do is to classify man’s habitation of this earth, as well as\r\nwe can, under certain well-defined, and known conditions. Thus, that\r\ncalled the Stone Age, must be divided into two parts, that of the\r\nroughly chipped flint implements--which is designated the _Palæolithic_\r\nperiod--and that of the polished and carefully finished stone arms and\r\nimplements, which necessarily show a later time, and a higher state of\r\ncivilisation--which is called the _Neolithic_ period. The next age is\r\nthat of bronze, when man had learned to smelt metals, and make moulds,\r\nshowing a great advance--and, finally, the Iron Age, in which man had\r\nsubdued the sterner metal to his will--and this age immediately precedes\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\nThe cave men were of undoubted antiquity--and were hunters of the wild\r\nbeasts that then overran Western Europe, and who split the bones of\r\nthose animals which they slew in order to obtain the marrow. Although\r\nstrictly belonging to the Palæolithic period, they manufactured out of\r\nthat stubborn material, flint, spear-heads, knives, scrapers--and, when\r\nthe bow had been invented, arrow-heads. Nor were they deficient in the\r\nrudiments of art, as some tracings and carvings on pieces of the horns\r\nof slaughtered animals, clearly show. Mr. Christie in digging in the\r\nDordogne caves found, at La Madelaine, engraved and carved pictures of\r\nreindeer, an ibex, a mammoth, &c., all of them recognisable, and the\r\nmammoth, a very good likeness. This was incised on a piece of mammoth\r\ntusk.\r\n\r\nThe lake men, judging by the remains found near their dwellings,\r\noccupied their houses during the Stone and Bronze periods. Herodotus\r\nmentions these curious dwellings. “But those around Mount Pangæus and\r\nnear the Doberes, the Agrianæ, Odomanti, and those who inhabit Lake\r\nPrasias[23] itself, were not at all subdued by Megabazus. Yet he\r\nattempted to conquer those who live upon the lake, in dwellings\r\ncontrived after this manner: planks, fitted on lofty piles, are placed\r\nin the middle of the lake, with a narrow entrance from the mainland by\r\na single bridge. These piles that support the planks, all the citizens\r\nanciently placed there at the common charge; but, afterwards, they\r\nestablished a law to the following effect; whenever a man marries, for\r\neach wife he sinks three piles, bringing wood from a mountain called\r\nOrbelus; but every man has several wives. They live in the following\r\nmanner; every man has a hut on the planks, in which he dwells, with a\r\ntrap door closely fitted in the planks, and leading down to the lake.\r\nThey tie the young children with a cord round the foot, fearing lest\r\nthey should fall into the lake beneath. To their horses and beasts of\r\nburden they give fish for fodder; of which there is such an abundance,\r\nthat, when a man has opened his trap-door, he lets down an empty basket\r\nby a cord into the lake, and, after waiting a short time, draws it up\r\nfull of fish.”[24]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a valuable record of the lake dwellings, and similar\r\nones have been found in the lake of Zurich. In 1854, owing to the\r\ndryness and cold of the preceding winter, the water fell a foot below\r\nany previous record: and, in a small bay between Ober Meilen and\r\nDollikon, the inhabitants took advantage to reclaim the soil thus left,\r\nand add it to their gardens, by building a wall as far out as they\r\ncould--and they raised the level of the land thus gained, by dredging\r\nthe mud out of the lake. In the course of dredging they found deer\r\nhorns, tiles and various implements, and, the attention of an antiquary\r\nhaving been directed to this find, he concluded that it was the site of\r\nan ancient lake village. The lakes of Geneva, Constance, and\r\nNeufchatel, have also yielded much that throws light on the habits and\r\nintelligence of these lake men. They wove, they made pottery, they grew\r\nand parched corn--nay they ground it, and made biscuits, they ate\r\napples, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, hazel and beech nuts,\r\nand peas. They evidently fed on cereals, fruit, fish, and the flesh of\r\nwild animals, for bones of the following animals have been found. Brown\r\nbear, badger, marten, pine marten, polecat, wolf, fox, wild cat, beaver,\r\nelk, urus, bison, stag, roe-deer, wild boar, marsh boar--whilst their\r\ndomestic animals were the boar, horse, ox, goat, sheep, and dog. These,\r\nit must be remembered, range over a wide period, including the stone and\r\nbronze ages. They wore ornaments, too, for pins, and bracelets have been\r\nfound. Lake dwellings have been found in Scotland, England, Italy,\r\nGermany and France--so that this practice seems to have obtained very\r\nwidely. In Ireland they made artificial islands in the lakes, called\r\nCrannoges, on which they erected their dwellings. Pile dwellings now\r\nexist, and are inhabited in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nWe have other traces of prehistoric man in the shell mounds,\r\nkjökkenmöddings, or kitchen middens, which still exist in Denmark, and\r\nhave been found in Scotland on the shores of the Moray Firth and Loch\r\nSpynie; in Cornwall, and Devon, at St. Valéry at the mouth of the Somme,\r\nin Australia, Tierra del Fuego, the Malay Peninsula, the Andaman\r\nIslands, and North and South America, showing a very wide range. The\r\nDanish kjökkenmöddings, when first thoroughly noticed, (of course, in\r\nthis century), were taken to be raised beaches--but when they were\r\nexamined, it was found that the shells were of four species of molluscs\r\nor shell-fish,[25] that did not live together, and that they were\r\neither full-grown, or nearly so. A stricter examination was made, and\r\nthe result was the finding of some flint implements, and bones marked by\r\nknives, conclusively showing that man had had a hand in this collection\r\nof shells--and the conclusion was come to that these were the sites of\r\nvillages of a prehistoric man, a hypothesis which was fully borne out by\r\nthe discovery, in some of them, of hearths bearing traces of having\r\nborne fire. Thus, then, these refuse heaps were clearly the work of a\r\nvery ancient race, so poor, and backward, as to be obliged to live on\r\nshell-fish--and these mounds were made by the shells which they threw\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWe can find a very great analogy between them and the Tierra del\r\nFuegans, when Darwin visited them, while with the surveying ships\r\n_Adventure_ and _Beagle_, a voyage which took from 1832 to 1836; and,\r\nwhen we read the following extracts from Darwin’s account of the\r\nexpedition, we can fancy we have before us a vivid picture of the makers\r\nof the kitchen middens. “The inhabitants, living chiefly upon\r\nshell-fish, are obliged constantly to change their place of residence;\r\nbut they return at intervals to the same spots, as is evident from the\r\npile of old shells, which must often amount to some tons in weight.\r\nThese heaps can be distinguished at a long distance by the bright green\r\ncolour of certain plants which invariably grow on them.... The Fuegian\r\nwigwam resembles, in size and dimensions, a haycock. It merely consists\r\nof a few broken branches stuck in the ground, and very imperfectly\r\nthatched on one side, with a few tufts of grass and rushes. The whole\r\ncannot be so much as the work of an hour, and it is only used for a few\r\ndays.... At a subsequent period, the _Beagle_ anchored for a couple of\r\ndays under Wollaston Island, which is a short way to the northward.\r\nWhile going on shore, we pulled alongside a canoe with six Fuegians.\r\nThese were the most abject and miserable creatures I anywhere beheld. On\r\nthe east coast, the natives, as we have seen, have guanaco cloaks, and,\r\non the west, they possess sealskins. Amongst the central tribes the men\r\ngenerally possess an otter skin, or some small scrap about as large as a\r\npocket handkerchief, which is barely sufficient to cover their backs as\r\nlow down as their loins. It is laced across the breast by strings, and,\r\naccording as the wind blows, it is shifted from side to side. But these\r\nFuegians in the canoe were quite naked, and even one full-grown woman\r\nwas absolutely so. It was raining heavily, and the fresh water, together\r\nwith the spray, trickled down her body.... These poor wretches were\r\nstunted in their growth, their hideous faces bedaubed with white paint,\r\ntheir skins filthy and greasy, their hair entangled, their voices\r\ndiscordant, their gestures violent and without dignity. Viewing such\r\nmen, one can hardly make oneself believe they are fellow-creatures and\r\ninhabitants of the same world.... At night, five or six human beings,\r\nnaked, and scarcely protected from the wind and rain of this tempestuous\r\nclimate, sleep on the wet ground, coiled up like animals. Whenever it is\r\nlow water, they must rise to pick shell-fish from the rocks; and the\r\nwomen, winter and summer, either dive and collect sea eggs, or sit\r\npatiently in their canoes, and, with a baited hair line, jerk out small\r\nfish. If a seal is killed, or the floating carcase of a putrid whale\r\ndiscovered, it is a feast: such miserable food is assisted by a few\r\ntasteless berries, and fungi. Nor are they exempt from famine, and, as a\r\nconsequence, cannibalism accompanied by parricide.”\r\n\r\nThis I believe to be as faithful a picture as can be drawn of the makers\r\nof the shell mounds.\r\n\r\nBut in Denmark, although shells formed by far the major part of these\r\nmiddens, yet they ate other fish, the herring, dorse, dab, and eel.\r\nBirds also were not despised by them, bones of swallows, the sparrow,\r\nstork, capercailzie, ducks, geese, wild swans, and even of the great auk\r\n(now extinct) have been found. Then of beasts they ate the stag,\r\nroe-deer, wild boar, urus, dog, fox, wolf, marten, otter, lynx, wild\r\ncat, hedgehog, bear, and mouse; beside which they lived on the seal,\r\nporpoise, and water rat.\r\n\r\nOwing to the almost total absence of polished implements--and yet the\r\nfact being that portions of one or two have been found--the makers of\r\nthese kjökkenmöddings, are classed as belonging to the later Palæolithic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nOf the Bronze and Iron Ages there is no necessity to write, men were\r\nemerging from their primæval barbarity--and all the gentle arts, though\r\nundeveloped, were nascent. Men who could smelt metals, and mould, and\r\nforge them, cannot be considered as utter barbarians, such as were the\r\nlong-headed men, with their chipped flint implements and weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes a specimen of humanity has got astray in infancy, and has been\r\ndragged up somehow in the woods, like Caspar Hauser, and Peter the Wild\r\nBoy, and fiction supplies other instances, such as Romulus and Remus,\r\nOrson, &c. Some of them were credited with being hairy as are the\r\naccompanying wild man and woman, as they are portrayed in John Sluper’s\r\nbook, where they are thus described:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“L’HOMME SAUVAGE.\r\n\r\n    “Combien que Dieu le createur seul sage,\r\n    A fait user les hommes de raison:\r\n    Icy voyez un vray homme sauvage,\r\n    Son corps vela est en toute saison.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“LA FEMME SAUVAGE.\r\n\r\n    “Femme sauvage a l’œil humain, non sainte,\r\n    Ainsi qu’elle est sur le naturel lieu,\r\n    Au naturel vous est icy depeinte,\r\n    Comme voyez qu’il appert a votre vue.”\r\n\r\nWhen Cæsar came to Britain for the second time, he found the Britons,\r\nalthough to a great extent civilised, having cavalry and charioteers (so\r\nmany of the latter, that Cassivelaunus left about 4000 to watch the\r\nRomans), and knowing the art of fortification, yet in themselves, only\r\njust emerging from utter barbarism--the colouring and shaving of\r\nthemselves showed that they had vanity, and were making, after their\r\nfashion, the most of their personal charms. Cæsar (Book v. 14) writes:\r\n“Of all these _tribes_, by far the most civilised are those who inhabit\r\nKent, which district is altogether maritime; nor do they differ much\r\nfrom the Gallic customs. Most of those in the interior do not sow corn,\r\nbut live on flesh and milk, and are clad in skins. All the Britons, in\r\ntruth, dye themselves with woad, which produces a bluish colour, and on\r\nthis account they are of a more frightful aspect in battle. They have\r\nflowing hair, and every part of the body shaved, except the head and the\r\nupper lip. Ten, and _even_ twelve of them have wives in common between\r\nthem, and chiefly brothers with brothers, and fathers with sons; but, if\r\nthere is any offspring, they are considered to be the children of those\r\nby whom each virgin was first espoused.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIRY MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, as we may conjecture from the above, the ancient Briton was “a\r\nrugged man, o’ergrown with hair,” his full-dress toilette must have\r\noccupied some time. But extreme hairiness in human beings is by no means\r\nsingular, and very many cases are recorded in medical books. Many of us\r\nmay remember the Spanish dancer, Julia Pastrana, whose whole body was\r\nhairy, and who had a fine beard. She had a child on whom the hair began\r\nto grow, like its mother; and, but a few years back, there was a hairy\r\nfamily exhibited in London--their faces being covered with hair, as is\r\nthe case of the _Puella pilosa_, or Hairy Girl--given by Aldrovandus in\r\nhis _Monstrorum Historia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe was aged twelve years, and came from the Canary Isles, together with\r\nher father (aged 40), her brother (20), and her sister (8), all as\r\nhairy one as the other. They were brought over by Marius Casalius, and\r\nfirst shown at Bologna, so that this is no doubt a faithful likeness, as\r\nAldrovandus lived and died in that city. He gives other examples, but\r\nnot so well authenticated as this.\r\n\r\nThere were two wonderful hairy people at Ava, in Burmah, who are\r\ndescribed by two most trustworthy eye-witnesses, John Crawford, in his\r\n“Journal of an Embassy from the Governor-General of India to the Court\r\nof Ava”--and in 1855, by Captain Henry Youle, in his “Narrative of the\r\nMission sent by the Governor-General of India to the Court of Ava.” They\r\nwere father and daughter, respectively named Shu-Maon, and Maphoon. The\r\nfather may strictly be said to have had neither eyelashes, eyebrows, nor\r\nbeard, because the whole of his face, including the interior and\r\nexterior of his ears, were covered with long silky silvery grey hair.\r\nHis whole body, except his hands and feet, was covered with hair of the\r\nsame texture and colour as that now described, but generally less\r\nabundant; it was most plentiful over the spine and shoulders, where it\r\nwas five inches long; over the breast, about four inches, and was most\r\nscanty on the arms, legs, thighs, and abdomen.\r\n\r\nOf the daughter, Captain Youle writes: “The whole of Maphoon’s face was\r\nmore or less covered with hair. On a part of the cheek, and between the\r\nnose and mouth, this was confined to a short down, but over all the rest\r\nof the face was a thick silky hair of a brown colour, paleing about the\r\nnose and chin, four or five inches long. At the alæ of the nose, under\r\nthe eye, and on the cheek bone this was very fully developed; but it was\r\nin, and on, the ear, that it was most extraordinary. Except the upper\r\ntip, no part of the ear was visible. All the rest was filled and veiled\r\nwith a large mass of silky hair, growing apparently out of every part of\r\nthe external organ, and hanging a pendant lock to a length of eight or\r\nten inches. The hair over her forehead was brushed so as to blend with\r\nthe hair of the head, the latter being dressed (as usual with her\r\ncountrywomen) _à la Chinoise_; it was not so thick as to conceal her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n“The nose, densely covered with hair, as no animal’s is, that I know of,\r\nand with long locks curving out, and pendant like the wisps of a fine\r\nSkye-terrier’s coat, had a most strange appearance. The beard was pale\r\nin colour, and about four inches in length, seemingly very soft and\r\nsilky.”\r\n\r\nMaphoon, when Captain Youle saw her, had two children, one, the eldest,\r\nperfectly normal, the other, who was very young, was evidently taking\r\nafter its mother.\r\n\r\nThe Aïnos, an aboriginal tribe in the north of Japan, who are looked\r\ndown upon by the Japanese as dogs, have always been reputed as being\r\ncovered with hair. Mr. W. Martin Wood read a paper before the\r\nEthnological Society of London[26] respecting them, and he said, “Esau\r\nhimself could not have been a more hairy man than are these Aïnos. The\r\nhair forms an enormous bush, and it is thick and matted. Their beards\r\nare very thick and long, and the greater part of their face is covered\r\nwith hair which is generally dark in colour; they have prominent\r\nforeheads, and mild, dark eyes, which somewhat relieve the savage aspect\r\nof their visage. Their hands and arms, and, indeed, the greater part of\r\ntheir bodies, are covered with an abnormal profusion of hair.”\r\n\r\nThis, however, has been questioned, notably by Mr. Barnard Davis, whose\r\npaper may be read in the 3rd vol. of the “Memoirs of the Anthropological\r\nSociety of London”--and he quotes from several travellers, to prove that\r\nthe hairyness of the Aïnos had been exaggerated. However, Miss Bird in\r\nher “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan” may fairly be said to have put the\r\nsubject at rest, for she visited, and travelled in the Aïno country.\r\nShe, certainly, disproves the theory that, as a race, they were hairy,\r\nalthough she confesses that some were--as, for instance (p. 232), “They\r\nwore no clothing, but only one was hairy,” and, writing from Biratori,\r\nYezo (p. 255), she says, “The men are about the middle height,\r\nbroad-chested, broad-shouldered, thick set, very strongly built, the\r\narms and legs short, thick, and muscular, the hands and feet large. The\r\nbodies, and especially the limbs of many, are covered with short,\r\nbristly hair. I have seen two boys whose backs are covered with fur as\r\nfine, and soft, as that of a cat.” Again (p. 283), “The profusion of\r\nblack hair, and a curious intensity about their eyes, coupled with the\r\nhairy limbs and singularly vigorous _physique_, give them a formidably\r\nsavage appearance; but the smile, full of ‘sweetness and light,’ in\r\nwhich both eyes and mouth bear part, and the low, musical voice, softer\r\nand sweeter than anything I have previously heard, make me, at times,\r\nforget that they are savages at all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OURAN OUTAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransition from hirsute humanity to the apes, is easy, and natural--and\r\nwe need only deal with the Simiinæ, which includes the Orang, the\r\nChimpanzee, and the Gorilla. These are the largest apes, and nearest\r\napproach to man--but, although they may be tailless, yet there is that\r\nshort great toe which prevents any acceptation of their humanity. The\r\norang is exclusively an inhabitant of Borneo and Sumatra, and in those\r\ntwo islands it may be found in the swampy forests near the coast. It\r\ngrows to a large size, for an ape, about four feet four inches high, but\r\nis neither so large, nor so strong, as the Gorilla. Compared with man,\r\nits arms seem to be as extravagantly long, as its legs are ridiculously\r\nshort. When wild, it feeds entirely on vegetable diet, and makes a kind\r\nof house, or nest, in trees, interweaving the branches, so as to obtain\r\nshelter. They do not stand confinement well, being languid and\r\nmiserable--but, in their native wildness, they can, if necessity arises,\r\nfight well in their own defence. A. R. Wallace, in his “Malay\r\nArchipelago; the Land of the Orang Utan and the Bird of Paradise,” tells\r\nthe following story of its combativeness.\r\n\r\n“A few miles down the river there is a Dyak house, and the inhabitants\r\nsaw a large orang feeding on the young shoots of a palm by the river\r\nside. On being alarmed, he retreated towards the jungle, which was close\r\nby, and a number of the men, armed with spears and choppers, ran out to\r\nintercept him. The man who was in front, tried to run his spear through\r\nthe animal’s body, but the orang seized it in his hands, and in an\r\ninstant got hold of the man’s arm, which he seized in his mouth, making\r\nhis teeth meet in the flesh above the elbow, which he tore and lacerated\r\nin a dreadful manner. Had not the others been close behind, the man\r\nwould have been seriously injured, if not killed, as he was quite\r\npowerless; but they soon destroyed the creature with their spears and\r\nchoppers. The man remained ill for a long time, and never fully\r\nrecovered the use of his arm.”\r\n\r\nIt is called the Simia Satyrus; probably on its presumed lustfulness,\r\ncertainly not on account of its resemblance to the satyr of antiquity.\r\n\r\nGesner gives us his idea of the orang, presenting us with the\r\naccompanying figure of the Cercopithecus, and quotes Cardanus as saying\r\nthat the Cercopithecus or Wild-man, is singularly made, having the\r\nheight and form of a man, with legs like man’s--and is covered all over\r\nwith hair. No animal can withstand it, with the exception of man, to\r\nwhom, when in its own regions, it is not inferior. It loves boys and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPliny speaks of the Satyr Ape thus: “Among the mountainous districts of\r\nthe eastern parts of India, in what is called the country of the\r\nCatharcludi, we find the Satyr, an animal of extraordinary swiftness.\r\nThey go sometimes on four feet, and sometimes walk erect; they have,\r\nalso, the features of a human being. On account of their swiftness,\r\nthese creatures are never to be caught, except when they are aged, or\r\nsickly,” and, in another place, he says, “The Sphyngium and the Satyr\r\nstow away food in the pouches of their cheeks, after which they will\r\ntake out piece by piece in their hands, and eat it.”\r\n\r\nTopsell has mixed up the Simia Satyrus with the classical satyr, having\r\nlegs and horns like goats; but he evidently alludes to the former in\r\nthis passage. “The _Satyres_ are in the Islands _Satiridæ_, which are\r\nthree in number, right over against India on the farther side of the\r\n_Ganges_; of which _Euphemus Car_ rehearseth this history: that when he\r\nsailed unto _Italy_, by the rage of winde and evill weather, they were\r\ndriven to a coast unnavigable, where were many desart Islandes,\r\ninhabited of wild men, and the marriners refused to land upon some\r\nIslands, having heretofore had triall of the inhumaine and uncivill\r\nbehaviour of the inhabitants, so that they brought us to the _Satyrian\r\nIslands_, where we saw the inhabitants red, and had tayles joyned to\r\ntheir backs, not much lesse than horsses. These, being perceived by the\r\nmarriners to run to the shippes, and lay hold on the women that were in\r\nthem, the shipmen, for feare, took one of the Barbarian women, and set\r\nher on the land among them, whom in most odious and filthy manner, they\r\nabused, whereby they found them to be very bruit beasts.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe gives us his idea of the Simia Satyrus, which must have been an\r\naccomplished animal, for not only could it, apparently, play upon the\r\npipe, but it had a handy pouch for the reception of the fruit (in lieu\r\nof coppers) which it doubtless would receive as guerdon for its\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSATYRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also mentions and delineates a curious Ape which closely resembles\r\nthe classical Satyr: “Under the _Equinoctiall_, toward the East and\r\nSouth, there is a kind of Ape called _Ægopithecus_, an Ape like a Goate.\r\nFor there are Apes like Beares, called _Arctopitheci_, and some like\r\nLyons, called _Leontopitheci_, and some like Dogs, called _Cynocephali_,\r\nas is before expressed; and many other which have a mixt resemblance of\r\nother creatures in their members.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Amongst the rest there is a beast called PAN; who in his head, face,\r\nhorns, legs, and from the loynes downward resembleth a Goat, but in his\r\nbelly, breast, and armes, an Ape: such a one was sent by the King of\r\n_Indians_ to Constantine, which, being shut up in a cave or close place,\r\nby reason of the wildnesse thereof, lived there but a season, and when\r\nit was dead and bowelled, they pouldred it with spices, and carried it\r\nto be seene at Constantinople: the which beast having beene seene of the\r\nancient Græcians, were so amazed at the strangenesse thereof, that they\r\nreceived it for a God, as they did a Satyre, and other strange beasts.”\r\n\r\nI have said that Topsell has mixed the Ape and the Satyr,\r\ninextricably--but as his version has the charm of description and\r\nanecdote, I give it with little curtailment.\r\n\r\n“As the _Cynocephali_, or _Baboun_ Apes have given occasion to some to\r\nimagine (though falsly) there were such men, so the _Satyre_, a most\r\nrare and seldom seene beast, hath occasioned other to thinke it was a\r\nDevil; and the Poets with their Apes, the Painters, Limners, and\r\nCarvers, to encrease that superstition, have therefore described him\r\nwith hornes on his head, and feet like Goates, whereas Satires have\r\nneither of both. And it may be that Devils have at some time appeared to\r\nmen in this likenes, as they have done in the likeness of the\r\n_Onocentaure_ and wild Asse, and other shapes; it being also probable\r\nthat Devils take not any dænomination or shape from Satyres, but rather\r\nthe Apes themselves, from Devils whom they resemble, for there are many\r\nthings common to the Satyre Apes, and devilish Satyres, as their human\r\nshape, their abode in solitary places, their rough hayre, and lust to\r\nwomen, wherewith all other Apes are naturally infected; but especially\r\nSatyres....\r\n\r\n“Peradventure the name of Satyre is more fitly derived from the Hebrew,\r\n_Sair, Esa._ 34, whereof the plural is _Seirim, Esa._ 13, which is\r\ninterpreted monsters of the Desart, or rough hairy Fawnes; and when\r\nIisim is put to _Seir_, it signifieth Goats.\r\n\r\n“The _Chaldæans_, for _Seirim_, render _Schedin_; that is, evill\r\ndevills; and the _Arabians_, _lesejathin_, that is _Satanas_: the\r\n_Persyans_, _Devan_, the _Illyrians_, _Devadai_, and _Dewas_: the\r\n_Germans_, _Teufel_. They which passed through the world, and exercised\r\ndauncing and other sports for _Dionisius_, were called Satyres, and\r\nsometimes _Tytiri_, because of their wanton songes; sometimes _Sileni_\r\n(although the difference is, that the smaller and younger beasts are\r\ncalled _Satiri_, the elder, and greater, _Sileni_;) Also _Bacchæ_ and\r\n_Nymphæ_, wherefore _Bacchus_ is pictured riding in a chariot of vine\r\nbranches, _Silenus_ ridinge beside him on an Asse, and the _Bacchæ_ or\r\n_Satyres_ shaking togetheer their staulkie Javelines and Paulmers.[27]\r\nBy reason of their leaping they are called _Scirti_, and the anticke or\r\nsatyrical dauncing, _Sicinnis_, and they also sometimes _Sicinnistæ_;\r\nsometimes _Ægipanæ_; wherefore _Pliny_ reporteth, that among the\r\nwesterne _Ethiopians_, there are certain little hilles full of the\r\n_Satirique Ægipanæ_, and that, in the night-time they use great fires,\r\npiping and dansing, with a wonderful noise of Tymbrels and Cymbals; and\r\nso also in _Atlas_ amongest the Moores, whereof there was no footing,\r\nremnant, or appearance, to be found in the daytime.\r\n\r\n“... There are also _Satires_ in the Eastern mountaines of _India_, in\r\nthe country of the _Cartaduli_, and in the province of the _Comari_ and\r\n_Corudæ_, but the _Cebi_ spoken of before, bred in _Ethiopia_, are not\r\n_Satyres_ (though faced like them:) nor the _Prasyan_ Apes, which\r\nresemble _Satyres_ in short beards. There are many kindes of these\r\n_Satyres_ better distinguished by names than any properties naturall\r\nknown unto us. Such are the _Ægipanæ_, before declared, _Nymphes_ of the\r\nPoets, _Fawnes_, _Pan_ and _Sileni_, which, in time of the Gentiles were\r\nworshipped for Gods; and it was one part of their religion to set up the\r\npicture of a Satyre at their dores and gates, for a remedy against the\r\nbewitching of envious persons.\r\n\r\n“... Satyres have no humaine conditions in them, nor any other\r\nresemblance of men besides their outward shape; though _Solinus_ speakes\r\nof them like as of men. They carry their meate under their chin as in a\r\nstore house, and from thence being hungry, they take it forth to eat,\r\nmaking it ordinary with them every day, which is but annuall in the\r\n_Formicæ_ lions; being of very unquiet motions above other Apes. They\r\nare hardly taken, except sicke, great with yong, old or asleepe; for\r\n_Sylla_ had a _Satyre_ brought him, which was taken asleepe neare\r\n_Apollonia_, in the holy place _Nymphæum_, of whom he (by divers\r\ninterpreters) demanded many questions, but received no answer, save only\r\na voice very much like the neighing of a horse, wherof he being afraid,\r\nsent him away alive.\r\n\r\n“_Philostratus_ telleth another history, how that _Apollonius_ and his\r\ncolleagues, supping in a village of _Ethiopia_, beyond the fall of\r\n_Nilus_, they heard a sudden outcry of women calling to one another;\r\nsome saying, _Take him_, others, _Follow him_; likewise provoking their\r\nhusbands to helpe them: the men presently tooke clubs, stones, or what\r\ncame first to hand, complaining of an injury done unto their wives. Now\r\nsome ten moneths before, there had appeared a fearfull shew of a Satyre,\r\nraging upon their women, and had slain two of them, with whom he was in\r\nlove: the companions of _Apollonius_ quaked at the hearing hereof, and\r\n_Nilus_, one of them, swore (by _Jove_) that they being naked and\r\nunarmed, could not be able to resist him in his outragious lust, but\r\nthat he would accomplish his wantonnes as before: yet, said\r\n_Apollonius_, there is a remedy to quaile these wanton-leaping beasts,\r\nwhich men say _Midas_ used (for _Midas_ was of kindred to _Satyres_, as\r\nappeared by his eares). This _Midas_ heard his mother say, that\r\n_Satyres_ loved to be drunke with wine, and then sleep soundly, and\r\nafter that, be so moderate, mild and gentle, that a man might thinke\r\nthey had lost their first nature.\r\n\r\n“Whereupon he put wine into a fountain neere the highway, whereof, when\r\nthe _Satyre_ had tasted, he waxed meeke suddenly, and was overcome. Now\r\nthat we thinke not this a fable (saith _Apollonius_) let us go to the\r\nGovernor of the Towne, and inquire of him whether there be any wine to\r\nbe had that we may offer it to the _Satyre_, wherunto all consented, and\r\nthey filled foure great _Egyptian_ earthen vessels with wine, and put it\r\nin the fountain where their cattel were watred: this done, _Apollonius_\r\ncalled the _Satyre_, secretly thretning him, and the _Satire_, inraged\r\nwith the savour of the wine came; after he had drunke thereof, Now, said\r\n_Apollonius_, let us sacrifice to the _Satyre_, for he sleepeth, and so\r\nled the inhabitants to the dens of the _Nymphs_, distant a furlong from\r\nthe towne, and shewed them the _Satyre_ saying; Neither beat, cursse, or\r\nprovoke him henceforth, and he shall never harme you.\r\n\r\n“It is certaine, that the devills do many waies delude men in the\r\nlikeness of _Satyres_; for, when the drunken feasts of _Bacchus_ were\r\nyearely celebrated in _Parnassus_, there were many sightes of _Satyres_,\r\nand voyces, and sounding of cymbals heard: yet it is likely that there\r\nare men also like Satyres, inhabiting in some desart places; for _S.\r\nIerom_, in the life of _Paul the Eremite_, reporteth that there appeared\r\nto _S. Anthony_, an _Hippocentaure_ such as the Poets describe, and\r\npresently he saw, in a rocky valley adjoining, a little man having\r\ncroked nostrils, hornes growing out of his forhed, and the neather part\r\nof his body had Goat’s feet; the holy man, not dismayed, taking the\r\nshield of faith, and the breastplate of righteousnesse, like a good\r\nsouldior of Christ, pressed toward him, which brought him some fruites\r\nof palmes as pledges of his peace, upon which he fed in the journey;\r\nwhich Saint _Anthony_ perceiving, he asked him who he was, and received\r\nthis answere; I am a mortall creature, one of the inhabitants of this\r\nDesart, whom the Gentiles (deceived with error) doe worship, and call\r\n_Fauni_, _Satyres_, and _Incubi_: I am come in ambassage from our\r\nflocke, intreating that thou would’st pray for us unto the common GOD,\r\nwho came to save the world; the which words were no sooner ended, but he\r\nran away as fast as any foule could fly. And least this should seeme\r\nfalse, under _Constantine_ at _Alexandria_ there was such a man to be\r\nseene alive, and was a publick spectacle to all the World; the carcasse\r\nthereof, after his death, was kept from corruption by heat, through\r\nsalt, and was carried to _Antiocha_ that the Emperor himself might see\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“_Satyres_ are very sildom seene, and taken with great difficulty, as is\r\nbefore saide: for there were two of these founde in the woods of\r\n_Saxony_ towards _Dacia_, in a desart, the female was killed by the\r\ndarts of the hunters, and the biting of Dogs, but the male was taken\r\nalive, being in the upper parts like a man, and in the neather partes\r\nlike a Goat, but all hairy throughout: he was brought to be tame, and\r\nlearned to go upright, and also to speake some wordes, but with a voice\r\nlike a Goat, and without all reason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The famous learned man _George Fabricius_, shewed me this shape of a\r\nmonstrous beast that is fit to be joyned to the story of _Satyres_.\r\nThere was, (saide he,) in the territory of the Bishop of _Salceburgh_,\r\nin a forrest called _Fannesbergh_, a certaine foure-footed beast, of a\r\nyellowish carnation colour, but so wilde that he would never be drawne\r\nto looke upon any man, hiding himselfe in the darkest places, and beeing\r\nwatched diligently, would not be provoked to come forth so much as to\r\neate his meate--so that in a very short time it was famished. The hinder\r\nlegs were much unlike the former, and also much longer. It was taken\r\nabout the year of the Lord, one thousand five hundred, thirty, whose\r\nimage being here so lively described, may save us further labour in\r\ndiscoursing of his maine and different parts and proportion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPHYNX.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The SPHYNGA or _Sphinx_, is of the kind of Apes, but his breast up\r\nto his necke, pilde and smooth without hayre: the face is very round,\r\nyet sharp and piked, having the breasts of women, and their favor, or\r\nvisage, much like them: In that part of the body which is bare with out\r\nhaire, there is a certaine red thing rising in a round circle, like\r\nmillet seed, which giveth great grace & comeliness to their coulour,\r\nwhich in the middle part is humaine: Their voice is very like a man’s,\r\nbut not articulate, sounding as if one did speake hastily, with\r\nindignation or sorrow. Their haire browne, or swarthy coulour. They\r\nare bred in _India_, and _Ethiopia_. In the promontory of the farthest\r\n_Arabia_ neere _Dira_, are _Sphinges_, and certaine _Lyons_, called\r\n_Formicæ_, so, likewise, they are to be found amongest the _Trogloditæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“As the _Babouns_ and _Cynocephali_ are more wilde than other Apes, so\r\nthe _Satyres_ and _Sphynges_ are more meeke and gentle, for they are not\r\nso wilde that they will not bee tamed, nor yet so tame, but they will\r\nrevenge their own harmes; as appeared by that which was slayne in a\r\npublike spectacle among the _Thebanes_. They carrye their meat in the\r\nstore houses of their own chaps or cheeks, taking it forth when they are\r\nhungry, and so eat it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The name of this _Sphynx_ is taken from ‘binding,’ as appeareth by the\r\nGreek notation, or else of delicacie and dainty nice loosnesse,\r\n(wherefore there were certain common strumpets called _Sphinctæ_, and\r\nthe _Megarian Sphingas_ was a very popular phrase for notorious\r\nharlots), hath given occasion to the poets to faigne a certaine monster\r\ncalled _Sphynx_, which they say was thus derived. _Hydra_ brought\r\nfoorth the _Chimæra_, _Chimæra_ by _Orthus_, the _Sphynx_, and the\r\n_Nemæan_ Lyon: now, this _Orthus_ was one of _Geryon’s_ dogges. This\r\n_Sphynx_ they make a treble formed monster, a Mayden’s face, a Lyon’s\r\nlegs, and the wings of a fowle; or, as _Ansonius_ and _Varinus_ say, the\r\nface and head of a mayde, the body of a dogge, the winges of a byrd, the\r\nvoice of a man, the clawes of a Lyon, and the tayle of a dragon: and\r\nthat she kept continually in the _Sphincian_ mountaine; propounding to\r\nall travailers that came that way an _Ænigma_, or Riddle, which was\r\nthis: _What was the creature that first of all goeth on foure legges;\r\nafterwards on two, and, lastly, on three_: and all of them that could\r\nnot dissolve that Riddle, she presently slew, by taking them, and\r\nthrowing them downe headlong, from the top of a Rocke. At last _Œdipus_\r\ncame that way, and declared the secret, that it _was a man, who in his\r\ninfancy creepeth on all foure_, afterward, _in youth, goeth upon two\r\nlegs_, and last of all, _in olde age taketh unto him a staffe which\r\nmaketh him to goe, as it were, on three legs_; which the monster\r\nhearing, she presently threwe down herselfe from the former rocke, and\r\nso she ended. Whereupon Œdipus is taken for a subtill and wise opener of\r\nmysteries.\r\n\r\n“But the truth is, that when _Cadmus_ had married an _Amazonian_ woman,\r\ncalled _Sphynx_, and, with her, came to _Thebes_, and there slew _Draco_\r\ntheir king, and possessed his kingdom, afterwards there was a sister\r\nunto _Draco_ called _Harmona_, whom _Cadmus_ married, _Sphynx_ being yet\r\nalive. She, in revenge, (being assisted by many followers,) departed\r\nwith great store of wealth into the mountaine _Sphincius_, taking with\r\nher a great Dogge, which _Cadmus_ held in great account, and there made\r\ndaily incursions or spoiles upon his people. Now, _ænigma_, in the\r\n_Theban_ language, signifieth an inrode, or warlike incursion, wherfore\r\nthe people complained in this sort. _This GRECIAN SPHINX robbeth us, in\r\nsetting up with an ÆNIGMA, but no man knoweth after what manner she\r\nmaketh this ÆNIGMA._\r\n\r\n“_Cadmus_ hereupon made proclamation, that he would give a very\r\nbountifull reward unto him that would kill _Sphinx_, upon which occasion\r\nthe Corinthian _Œdipus_ came unto her, being mounted on a swift courser,\r\nand accompanied with some _Thebans_ in the night season, slue her. Other\r\nsay that _Œdipus_ by counterfaiting friendshippe, slue her, making shew\r\nto be of her faction; and _Pausanius_ saith, that the former Riddle, was\r\nnot a Riddle, but an Oracle of _Apollo_, which _Cadmus_ had received,\r\nwhereby his posterity should be inheritors of the _Theban_ kingdome; and\r\nwhereas _Œdipus_, being the son of _Laius_, a former king of that\r\ncountrey, was taught the Oracle in his sleepe, he recouvered the\r\nkingdome usurped by _Sphinx_ his sister, and, afterwards, unknown,\r\nmarried his mother Jocasta.\r\n\r\n“But the true morall of this poetical fiction is by that learned\r\n_Alciatus_, in one of his emblems, deciphered; that her monstrous treble\r\nformed shape signified her lustfull pleasure under a Virgin’s face, her\r\ncruell pride, under the Lyon’s clawes, her winde-driven leuitye, under\r\nthe Eagles, or birdes feathers, and I will conclude with the wordes of\r\n_Suidas_ concerning such monsters, that the _Tritons_, _Sphinges_, and\r\n_Centaures_, are the images of those things, which are not to be founde\r\nwithin the compasse of the whole world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSluper, who could soar to the height of delineating a Cyclops, is equal\r\nto the occasion when he has to deal with Apes, and here he gives us an\r\nApe which, unfortunately, does not seem to have survived to modern\r\ntimes--namely, one which wove for itself coarse cloth, probably of\r\nrushes; had a cloak of skin, and walked upright, with the aid of a\r\nwalking-stick, and was so genteel, that, having no boots, he seems to\r\nhave blacked his feet. And thus he sings of it:\r\n\r\n    “Pres le Peru par effect le voit on,\r\n      Dieu a donné au Singe telle forme.\r\n    Vestu dejonc, s’appuyant d’un baston,\r\n      Estãt debout, chose aux hõmes cõforme.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of Apes, I cannot refrain from noticing\r\nanother of this genus mentioned by Topsell, and that is the\r\nArctopithecus or Bear Ape:--“There is in America a very deformed beast,\r\nwhich the inhabitants call _Haut_ or _Hauti_, and the Frenchmen\r\n_Guenon_, as big as a great Affrican Monkey. His belly hangeth very low,\r\nhis head and face like unto a childes, and being taken, it will sigh\r\nlike a young childe. His skin is of an ashe-colour, and hairie like a\r\nBeare: he hath but three clawes on a foote, as longe as foure fingers,\r\nand like the thornes of Privet, whereby he climbeth up into the highest\r\ntrees, and for the most part liveth of the leaves of a certain tree,\r\nbeeing of an exceeding heighth, which the _Americans_ call _Amahut_, and\r\nthereof this beast is called _Haut_. Their tayle is about three fingers\r\nlong, having very little haire thereon; it hath beene often tried, that\r\nthough it suffer any famine, it will not eate the fleshe of a living\r\nman, and one of them was given me by a French-man, which I kept alive\r\nsixe and twenty daies, and at the last it was killed by Dogges, and in\r\nthat time when I had set it abroad in the open ayre, I observed that,\r\n_although it often rained, yet was that beast never wet_.[28] When it is\r\ntame, it is very loving to a man, and desirous to climbe uppe to his\r\nshoulders, which those naked _Amerycans_ cannot endure, by reason of the\r\nsharpnesse of his Clawes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL LORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Pliny for much strange animal lore--which, however,\r\nwill scarcely bear the fierce light of modern investigation. Thus, he\r\ntells us of places in which certain animals are not to be found, and\r\nnarrates some very curious zoological anecdotes thereon. “It is a\r\nremarkable fact, that nature has not only assigned different countries\r\nto different animals, but that even in the same country it has denied\r\ncertain species to certain localities. In Italy, the dormouse is found\r\nin one part only, the Messian forest. In Lycia, the gazelle never passes\r\nbeyond the mountains which border upon Syria; nor does the wild ass in\r\nthat vicinity pass over those which divide Cappadocia from Cilicia. On\r\nthe banks of the Hellespont, the stags never pass into a strange\r\nterritory, and, about Arginussa, they never go beyond Mount Elaphus;\r\nthose upon the mountains, too, have cloven ears. In the island of\r\nPoroselene, the weasels will not so much as cross a certain road. In\r\nBœotia, the moles, which were introduced at Lebadea, fly from the very\r\nsoil of that country, while in the neighbourhood, at Orchomenus, the\r\nvery same animals tear up all the fields. We have seen coverlets for\r\nbeds made of the skin of these creatures, so that our sense of religion\r\ndoes not prevent us from employing these ominous animals for the\r\npurposes of luxury.\r\n\r\n“When hares have been brought to Ithaca, they die as soon as ever they\r\ntouch the shore, and the same is the case with rabbits, on the shores of\r\nthe island of Ebusus; while they abound in the vicinity, Spain namely,\r\nand the Balearic isles. In Cyrene, the frogs were formerly dumb, and\r\nthis species still exists, although croaking ones were carried over\r\nthere from the Continent. At the present day, even, the frogs of the\r\nisland of Seriphos are dumb; but when they are carried to other places,\r\nthey croak; the same thing is also said to have taken place at\r\nSicandrus, a lake of Thessaly. In Italy, the bite of a shrew-mouse is\r\nvenomous; an animal which is not to be found in any region beyond the\r\nApennines. In whatever country it exists, it always dies immediately if\r\nit goes across the rut made by a wheel. Upon Olympus, a mountain of\r\nMacedonia, there are no wolves, nor yet in the isle of Crete. In this\r\nisland there are neither foxes nor bears, nor, indeed, any kind of\r\nbaneful animal, with the exception of the phalangium, a species of\r\nspider. It is a thing still more remarkable, that in this island there\r\nare no stags, except in the district of Cydon; the same is the case with\r\nthe wild boar, the woodcock, and the hedgehog.”\r\n\r\nHe further tells us of animals which will injure strangers only, as also\r\nanimals which injure the natives only.\r\n\r\n“There are certain animals which are harmless to the natives of the\r\ncountry, but destroy strangers; such as the little serpents at\r\nTirynthus, which are said to spring out of the earth. In Syria, also,\r\nand especially on the banks of the Euphrates, the serpents never attack\r\nthe Syrians when they are asleep, and even if they happen to bite a\r\nnative who treads upon them, their venom is not felt; but to persons of\r\nany other country they are extremely hostile, and fiercely attack them,\r\ncausing a death attended with great torture. On this account the Syrians\r\nnever kill them. On the contrary, on Latmos, a mountain of Caria, as\r\nAristotle tells us, strangers are not injured by the scorpions, while\r\nthe natives are killed by them.”\r\n\r\nHe also throws some curious light, unknown to modern zoologists, on the\r\nantipathies of animals one to another. He says:--“There will be no\r\ndifficulty in perceiving that animals are possessed of other instincts\r\nbesides those previously mentioned. In fact, there are certain\r\nantipathies, and sympathies among them, which give rise to various\r\naffections, besides those which we have mentioned in relation to each\r\nspecies, in its appropriate place. The Swan and the Eagle are always at\r\nvariance, and the Raven and the Chloreus seek each other’s eggs by\r\nnight. In a similar manner, also, the Raven and the Kite are perpetually\r\nat war with one another, the one carrying off the other’s food. So,\r\ntoo, there are antipathies between the Crow and the Owl, the Eagle and\r\nthe Trochilus; between the last two, if we are to believe the story,\r\nbecause the latter has received the title of ‘the king of birds;’ the\r\nsame, again, with the Owlet and all the smaller birds.\r\n\r\n“Again, in relation to the terrestrial animals, the Weasel is at enmity\r\nwith the Crow, the Turtle-dove with the Pyrallis, the Ichneumon with the\r\nWasp, and the Phalangium with other Spiders. Among aquatic animals,\r\nthere is enmity between the Duck and the Seamew, the Falcon known as the\r\n‘Harpe,’ and the Hawk called the ‘Triorchis.’ In a similar manner, too,\r\nthe Shrew-mouse and the Heron are ever on the watch for each other’s\r\nyoung; and the Ægithus, so small a bird as it is, has an antipathy for\r\nthe Ass; for the latter, when scratching itself, rubs its body against\r\nthe brambles, and so crushes the bird’s nest; a thing of which it stands\r\nin such dread, that, if it only hears the voice of the Ass when it\r\nbrays, it will throw its eggs out of the nest, and the young ones,\r\nthemselves, will, sometimes, fall to the ground in their fright; hence\r\nit is that it will fly at the Ass, and peck at its sores with its beak.\r\n\r\n“The Fox, too, is at war with the Nisus, and Serpents with Weasels and\r\nSwine. Æsalon is the name given to a small bird that breaks the eggs of\r\nthe Raven, and the young of which are anxiously sought by the Fox;\r\nwhile, in its turn, it will peck at the young of the Fox, and even the\r\nparent itself. As soon as the Ravens espy this, they come to its\r\nassistance, as though against a common enemy. The Acanthis, too, lives\r\namong the brambles; hence it is that it also has an antipathy to the\r\nAss, because it devours the bramble blossoms. The Ægithus and the\r\nAnthus, too, are at such mortal enmity with each other, that it is the\r\ncommon belief that their blood will not mingle; and it is for this\r\nreason that they have the bad repute of being employed in many magical\r\nincantations. The Thos and the Lion are at war with each other; and,\r\nindeed, the smallest objects and the greatest, just as much.\r\nCaterpillars will avoid a tree that is infested with Ants. The Spider,\r\npoised in its web, will throw itself on the head of a Serpent, as it\r\nlies stretched beneath the shade of the tree where it has built, and,\r\nwith its bite, pierce its brain; such is the shock, that the creature\r\nwill hiss from time to time, and then, seized with vertigo, coil round\r\nand round, while it finds itself unable to take to flight, or so much as\r\nto break the web of the spider, as it hangs suspended above; this scene\r\nonly ends with its death.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANTICORA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf curious animals, other than Apes, depicted as having some approach to\r\nthe human countenance, perhaps the most curious is the Manticora. It is\r\nnot a _parvenu_; it is of ancient date, for Aristotle mentions it.\r\nSpeaking of the dentition of animals, he says:--“None of these genera\r\nhave a double row of teeth. But, if we may believe Ctesias, there are\r\nsome which have this peculiarity, for he mentions an Indian animal\r\ncalled Martichora, which had three rows of teeth in each jaw; it is as\r\nlarge and rough as a lion, and has similar feet, but its ears and face\r\nare like those of a man; its eye is grey, and its body red; it has a\r\ntail like a land Scorpion, in which there is a sting; it darts forth the\r\nspines with which it is covered, instead of hair, and it utters a noise\r\nresembling the united sound of a pipe and a trumpet; it is not less\r\nswift of foot than a stag, and is wild, and devours men.”\r\n\r\nPliny also quotes Ctesias, but he slightly diverges, for he says it has\r\nazure eyes, and is of the colour of blood; he also affirms it can\r\nimitate the human speech. _Par parenthèse_ he mentions, in conjunction\r\nwith the Manticora, another animal similarly gifted:--“By the union of\r\nthe hyæna with the Æthiopian lioness, the Corocotta is produced, which\r\nhas the same faculty of imitating the voices of men and cattle. Its gaze\r\nis always fixed and immoveable; it has no gums in either of its jaws,\r\nand the teeth are one continuous piece of bone; they are enclosed in a\r\nsort of box, as it were, that they may not be blunted by rubbing against\r\neach other.”\r\n\r\n_Mais, revenons à nos moutons_, or rather Mantichora. Topsell, in making\r\nmention of this beast, recapitulates all that Ctesias has said on the\r\nsubject, and adds:--“And I take it to be the same Beast which _Avicen_\r\ncalleth _Marion_, and _Maricomorion_, with her taile she woundeth her\r\nHunters, whether they come before her or behinde her, and, presently,\r\nwhen the quils are cast forth, new ones grow up in their roome,\r\nwherewithal she overcometh all the hunters; and, although India be full\r\nof divers ravening beastes, yet none of them are stiled with a title of\r\n_Andropophagi_, that is to say, Men-eaters; except onely this\r\n_Mantichora_. When the Indians take a Whelp of this beast, they fall to\r\nand bruise the buttockes and taile thereof, so that it may never be fit\r\nto bring (_forth_) sharp quils, afterwards it is tamed without peril.\r\nThis, also, is the same beast which is called _Leucrocuta_, about the\r\nbignesse of a wilde Asse, being in legs and hoofes like a Hart, having\r\nhis mouth reaching on both sides to his eares, and the head and face\r\nof a female like unto a Badgers. It is also called _Martiora_, which in\r\nthe Parsian tongue, signifieth a devourer of men.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDu Bartas, in “His First Week, or the Birth of the World,” mentions our\r\nfriend as being created:--\r\n\r\n    “Then th’ _Vnicorn_, th’ _Hyæna_ tearing tombs,\r\n    Swift _Mantichor’_, and _Nubian Cephus_ comes;\r\n    Of which last three, each hath, (as heer they stand)\r\n    Man’s voice, Man’s visage, Man like foot and hand.”\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned by other writers--but I have a theory of my own about\r\nit, and that is, that it is only an idealised laughing hyæna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lamiæ are mythological--and were monsters of Africa, with the face\r\nand breast of a woman, the rest of the body like that of a serpent; they\r\nallured strangers, that they might devour them; and though not endowed\r\nwith the faculty of speech, their hissings were pleasing. Some believed\r\nthem to be evil spirits, who, in the form of beautiful women, enticed\r\nyoung children, and devoured them; according to some, the fable of the\r\nLamiæ is derived from the amours of Jupiter with a beautiful woman,\r\nLamia, whom Juno rendered deformed, and whose children she destroyed;\r\nLamia became insane, and so desperate, that she ate up all the children\r\nwhich came in her way.\r\n\r\nTopsell, before entering upon the natural history of the Lamia, as an\r\nanimal, tells the following story of it as a mythological being:--“It is\r\nreported of _Menippus_ the Lycian, that he fell in love with a strange\r\nwoman, who at that time seemed both beautifull, tender, and rich, but,\r\nin truth, there was no such thing, and all was but a fantastical\r\nostentation; she was said to insinuate her selfe, into his familiaritie\r\nafter this manner: as he went upon a day alone from _Corinth_ to\r\n_Senchræa_, hee met with a certaine phantasme, or spectre like a\r\nbeautifull woman, who tooke him by the hand, and told him she was a\r\n_Phœnician_ woman, and of long time had loved him dearely, having sought\r\nmany occasions to manifest the same, but could never finde opportunitie\r\nuntill that day, wherefore she entreated him to take knowledge of her\r\nhouse, which was in the Suburbes of _Corinth_, therewithall pointing\r\nunto it with her finger, and so desired his presence. The young man\r\nseeing himselfe thus wooed by a beautiful woman, was easily overcome by\r\nher allurements, and did oftimes frequent her company.\r\n\r\n“There was a certaine wise man, and a Philosopher, which espied the\r\nsame, and spake unto _Menippus_ in this manner, ‘O formose, et a\r\nformorsis, expetitie mulieribus, ophin thalpies, cai se ophis,’ that is\r\nto say, ‘O fair _Menippus_, beloved of beautiful women, art thou a\r\nserpent, and dost nourish a serpent?’ by which words he gave him his\r\nfirst admonition, or incling of a mischiefe; but not prevayling,\r\n_Menippus_ proposed to marry with this spectre, her house to the outward\r\nshew, being richly furnished with all manner of houshold goods; then\r\nsaid the wise man againe unto _Menippus_, ‘This gold, silver, and\r\nornaments of house, are like to _Tantalus_ Apples, who are said by\r\n_Homer_ to make a faire shew, but to containe in them no substance at\r\nall; even so, whatsoever you conceave of this riches, there is no matter\r\nor substance in the things which you see, for they are onely inchaunted\r\nimages, and shadowes, which that you may beleeve, this your neate bride\r\nis one of the _Empusæ_, called _Lamia_, or _Mormolicæ_, wonderfull\r\ndesirous of commerce with men, and loving their flesh above measure; but\r\nthose whom they doe entice, afterwards they devoure without love or\r\npittie, feeding upon their flesh.’ At which words the wise man caused\r\nthe gold and silver plate, and household stuffe, cookes, and servants to\r\nvanish all away. Then did the spectre like unto one that wept, entreate\r\nthe wise man that he would not torment her, nor yet cause her to\r\nconfesse what manner of person she was; but he on the other side being\r\ninexorable, compelled her to declare the whole truth, which was, that\r\nshe was a Phairy, and that she purposed to use the companie of\r\n_Menippus_, and feede him fat with all manner of pleasures, to the\r\nextent that, afterward, she might eate up and devour his body, for all\r\ntheir kinde love was only to feed upon beautiful yong men....\r\n\r\n“To leave therefore these fables, and come to the true description of\r\nthe _Lamia_, we have in hand. In the foure and thirty chapter of Esay,\r\nwe do find this called a beast _Lilith_ in the Hæbrew, and translated by\r\nthe auncients _Lamia_, which is threatened to possesse _Babell_.\r\nLikewise in the fourth chapter of the Lamentations, where it is said in\r\nour English translation, that the Dragons lay forth their brests, in\r\nHæbrew they are called _Ehannum_, which, by the confession of the best\r\ninterpreters, cannot signifie Dragons, but rather Sea calves, being a\r\ngenerall word for strange wilde beasts. How be it the matter being wel\r\nexamined, it shall appeare that it must needes be this Lamia, because of\r\nher great breastes, which are not competible either to the Dragon, or\r\nSea calves; so then, we wil take it for graunted, by the testimony of\r\nholy Scripture, that there is such a beast as this _Cristostinius_.\r\n_Dion_ also writeth that there are such beasts in some parts of _Libia_,\r\nhaving a Woman’s face, and very beautifull, also very large and comely\r\nshapes on their breasts, such as cannot be counterfeited by the art of\r\nany painter, having a very excellent colour in their fore parts, without\r\nwings, and no other voice but hissing like Dragons: they are the\r\nswiftest of foote of all earthly beasts, so as none can escape them by\r\nrunning, for, by their celerity, they compasse their prey of beastes,\r\nand by their fraud they overthrow men. For when they see a man, they lay\r\nopen their breastes, and by the beauty thereof, entice them to come\r\nneare to conference, and so, having them within their compasse, they\r\ndevoure and kill them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Unto the same things subscribe _Cælius_ and _Giraldus_, adding also,\r\nthat there is a certaine crooked place in _Libia_ neare the Sea-shore,\r\nfull of sand like to a sandy Sea, and all the neighbor places thereunto\r\nare deserts. If it fortune at any time, that through shipwrack, men come\r\nthere on shore, these beasts watch uppon them, devouring them all, which\r\neither endevour to travell on the land, or else to returne backe againe\r\nto Sea, adding also, that when they see a man they stand stone still,\r\nand stir not til he come unto them, looking down upon their breasts or\r\nto the ground, whereupon some have thought, that seeing them, at their\r\nfirst sight have such a desire to come neare them, that they are drawne\r\ninto their compasse, by a certaine naturall magicall witchcraft.... The\r\nhinderparts of the beast are like unto a Goate, his fore legs like a\r\nBeares, his upper parts to a woman, the body scaled all over like a\r\nDragon, as some have affirmed by the observation of their bodies, when\r\n_Probus_, the Emperor, brought them forth unto publike spectacle; also\r\nit is reported of them, that they devoure their own young ones, and\r\ntherefore they derive their name _Lamia_, of _Lamiando_; and thus much\r\nfor this beast.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTAUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary combination of man and animal is very ancient--and\r\nthe first I can find is Assyrian. Mr. W. St. Chad Boscawen, in one of\r\nhis British Museum Lectures (afterwards published under the title of\r\n_From under the Dust of Ages_), speaking of the seasons and the zodiacal\r\nsigns, in his lecture on _The Legend of Gizdhubar_, says:--“Gizdhubar\r\nhas a dream that the stars of heaven are falling upon him, and, like\r\nNebuchadnezzar, he can find no one to explain the hidden meaning to\r\nhim. He is, however, told by his huntsman, Zaidu, of a very wise\r\ncreature who dwells in the marshes, three days’ journey from Erech....\r\nThe strange being, whom this companion of the hero is despatched to\r\nbring to the Court, is one of the most interesting in the Epic. He is\r\ncalled Hea-bani--‘he whom Hea has made.’ This mysterious creature is\r\nrepresented on the gems, as half a man, and half a bull. He has the\r\nbody, face, and arms of a man, and the horns, legs, hoofs, and tail of a\r\nbull. Though in form rather resembling the satyrs, and in fondness for,\r\nand in association with the cattle, the rustic deity Pan, yet in his\r\ncompanionship with Gizdhubar, and his strange death, he approaches\r\nnearer the Centaur Chiron, who was the companion of Heracles.\r\n\r\n“By his name he was the son of Hea, whom Berosus identifies as Cronos,\r\nas Chiron was the son of Cronos. Like Chiron, he was celebrated for his\r\nwisdom, and acted as the counsellor of the hero, interpreting his\r\ndreams, and enabling him to overcome the enemies who attacked him.\r\nChiron met his death at the hand of Heracles, one of whose poisoned\r\narrows struck him, and, though immortal, he would not live any longer,\r\nand gave his immortality to Prometheus.... Zeus made Chiron among the\r\nstars a Sagittarius. Here again we have a striking echo of the Chaldæan\r\nlegend, in the Erech story. According to the arrangement of tablets, the\r\ndeath of Hea-bani takes place under the sign of Sagittarius, and is the\r\nresult of some fatal accident during the combat between Gizdhubar and\r\nKhumbaba. Like the Centaurs, before his call to the Court of Gizdhubar,\r\nHea-bani led a wild and savage life. It is said on the tablets ‘that he\r\nconsorted with the wild beasts. With the gazelles he took his food by\r\nnight, and consorted with the cattle by day, and rejoiced his heart\r\nwith the creeping things of the waters.’\r\n\r\n“Hea-Bani was true and loyal to Gizdhubar, and when Istar (the Assyrian\r\nVenus), foiled in her love for Gizdhubar, flew to heaven to see her\r\nfather Anu (the Chaldæan Zeus), and to seek redress for the slight put\r\nupon her, the latter created a winged bull, called ‘The Bull of Heaven,’\r\nwhich was sent to earth. Hea-Bani, however, helps his lord, the bull is\r\nslain, and the two companions enter Erech in triumph. Hea-Bani met with\r\nhis death when Gizdhubar fought Khumbaba, and ‘Gizdhubar for Hea-Bani\r\nhis friend wept bitterly and lay on the ground.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus, centuries before the Romans had emerged from barbarism, we have\r\nthe prototype of the classical Centaur, the man-horse. The fabled\r\nCentaurs were a people of Thessaly--half-men, half-horses--and their\r\nexistence is very cloudy. Still, they were often depicted, and the two\r\nexamples of a male and female Centaur, from a fresco at Pompeii, are\r\ncharmingly drawn. It will be seen that both are attended by Bacchantes\r\nbearing thyrses--a delicate allusion to their love of wine; for it was\r\nowing to this weakness that their famous battle with the Lapithæ took\r\nplace. The Centaurs were invited to the marriage of Hippodamia with\r\nPirithous, and, after the manner of cow-boys “up town,” they got\r\nintoxicated, were very rude, and even offered violence to the women\r\npresent. That, the good knights, Sir Hercules and Sir Theseus, could not\r\nstand, and with the Lapithæ, gave the Centaurs a thrashing, and made\r\nthem retire to Arcadia. They had a second fight over the matter of wine,\r\nfor the Centaur Pholus gave Hercules to drink of wine meant for him, but\r\nin the keeping of the Centaurs, and these ill-conditioned animals\r\nresented it, and attacked Hercules with fury. They were fearfully\r\npunished, and but few survived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPliny pooh-poohs the mythical origin of the Centaurs, and says they were\r\nThessalians, who dwelt along Mount Pelion, and were the first to fight\r\non horseback. Aldrovandus writes that, according to Licosthenes, there\r\nwere formerly found, in the regions of the Great Tamberlane, Centaurs of\r\nsuch a form as its upper part was that of a man, with two arms\r\nresembling those of a toad, and he gives a drawing from that author,\r\nso that the reader might diligently meditate whether such an animal was\r\npossible in a natural state of things; but the artist seems to have\r\nforgotten the fore-legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    “The Onocentaur is a monstrous beast;\r\n    Supposed halfe a man, and halfe an Asse,\r\n    That never shuts his eyes in quiet rest,\r\n    Till he his foes deare life hath round encompast.\r\n          Such were the Centaures in their tyrannie,\r\n          That liv’d by Humane flesh and villanie.”\r\n\r\n    --CHESTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GORGON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the title-page of one edition of “The Historie of Foure-footed\r\nBeastes” (1607) Topsell gives this picture of the Gorgon; and he says,\r\nrespecting this curious animal, the following:--“Among the manifold and\r\ndivers sorts of Beasts which are bred in Affricke, it is thought that\r\nthe _Gorgon_ is brought foorth in that countrey. It is a feareful and\r\nterrible beast to behold: it hath high and thicke eie-lids, eies not\r\nvery great, but much like an Oxes or Bugils, but all fiery bloudy, which\r\nneyther looke directly forwarde, nor yet upwards, but continuallye downe\r\nto the earth, and therefore are called in Greeke _Catobleponta_. From\r\nthe crowne of their head downe to their nose, they have a long hanging\r\nmane, which makes them to look fearefully. It eateth deadly and\r\npoysonfull hearbs, and if at any time he see a Bull, or other creature\r\nwhereof he is afraid, he presently causeth his mane to stand upright,\r\nand, being so lifted up, opening his lips, and gaping wide, sendeth\r\nforth of his throat a certaine sharpe and horrible breath, which\r\ninfecteth, and poysoneth the air above his head, so that all living\r\ncreatures which draw the breath of that aire are greevously afflicted\r\nthereby, loosing both voyce and sight, they fall into leathall and\r\ndeadly convulsions. It is bred in _Hesperia_ and _Lybia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The Poets have a fiction that the _Gorgones_ were the Daughters of\r\n_Medusa_ and _Phorcynis_, and are called _Steingo_, and by _Hesiodus_,\r\n_Stheno_, and _Eyryale_ inhabiting the _Gorgadion_ Ilands in the\r\n_Æthiopick Ocean_, over against the gardens of _Hesperia_. _Medusa_ is\r\nsaid to have the haires of his head to be living Serpentes, against whom\r\n_Perseus_ fought, and cut off his hed, for which cause he was placed in\r\nheaven on the North side of the _Zodiacke_ above the Waggon, and on the\r\nleft hand holding the _Gorgons_ head. The truth is that there were\r\ncertaine _Amazonian_ women in _Affricke_ divers from the _Scythians_,\r\nagainst whom _Perseus_ made warre, and the captaine of those women was\r\ncalled _Medusa_, whom _Perseus_ overthrew, and cut off her head, and\r\nfrom thence came the Poet’s fiction describing Snakes growing out of it\r\nas is aforesaid. These _Gorgons_ are bred in that countrey, and have\r\nsuch haire about their heads, as not onely exceedeth all other beastes,\r\nbut also poysoneth, when he standeth upright. Pliny calleth this beast\r\n_Catablepon_,[29] because it continually looketh downwards, and saith\r\nall the parts of it are but smal excepting the head, which is very\r\nheavy, and exceedeth the proportion of his body, which is never lifted\r\nup, but all living creatures die that see his eies.\r\n\r\n“By which there ariseth a question whether the poison which he sendeth\r\nfoorth, proceede from his breath, or from his eyes. Whereupon it is more\r\nprobable, that like the Cockatrice, he killeth by seeing, than by the\r\nbreath of his mouth, which is not competible to any other beasts in the\r\nworld. Besides, when the Souldiers of _Marius_ followed _Iugurtha_,\r\nthey saw one of these _Gorgons_, and, supposing it was some sheepe,\r\nbending the head continually to the earth, and moving slowly, they set\r\nupon him with their swords, whereat the Beast, disdaining, suddenly\r\ndiscovered his eies, setting his haire upright, at the sight whereof the\r\nSouldiers fel downe dead.\r\n\r\n“_Marius_, hearing thereof, sent other souldiers to kill the beaste, but\r\nthey likewise died, as the former. At last the inhabitantes of the\r\ncountrey, tolde the Captaine the poyson of this beast’s nature, and that\r\nif he were not killed upon a Sodayne, with onely the sight of his eies\r\nhe sent death into his hunters: then did the Captaine lay an ambush of\r\nsouldiers for him, who slew him sodainely with their speares, and\r\nbrought him to the Emperour, whereupon _Marius_ sent his skinne to Rome,\r\nwhich was hung up in the Temple of _Hercules_, wherein the people were\r\nfeasted after the triumphes; by which it is apparent that they kill with\r\ntheir eies, and not with their breath....\r\n\r\n“But to omit these fables, it is certaine that sharp poisoned sightes\r\nare called _Gorgon Blepen_, and therefore we will followe the Authoritie\r\nof _Pliny_ and _Athenæus_. It is a beast set all over with scales like a\r\nDragon, having no haire except on his head, great teeth like Swine,\r\nhaving wings to flie, and hands to handle, in stature betwixt a Bull and\r\na Calfe.\r\n\r\n“There be Ilandes called _Gorgonies_, wherein these monster-_Gorgons_\r\nwere bredde, and unto the daies of _Pliny_, the people of that countrey\r\nretained some part of their prodigious nature. It is reported by\r\n_Xenophon_, that _Hanno_, King of _Carthage_, ranged with his armie in\r\nthat region, and founde there, certaine women of incredible swiftenesse\r\nand perniscitie of foote. Whereof he tooke two onely of all that\r\nappeared in sight, which had such roughe and sharp bodies, as never\r\nbefore were seene. Wherefore, when they were dead, he hung up their\r\nskinnes in the Temple of _Juno_, for a monument of their straunge\r\nnatures, which remained there untill the destruction of _Carthage_. By\r\nthe consideration of this beast, there appeareth one manifest argument\r\nof the Creator’s devine wisdome and providence, who hath turned the eies\r\nof this beaste downeward to the earth, as it were thereby burying his\r\npoyson from the hurt of man; and shaddowing them with rough, long and\r\nstrong haire, that their poysoned beames should not reflect upwards,\r\nuntill the beast were provoked by feare or danger, the heavines of his\r\nhead being like a clogge to restraine the liberty of his poysonfull\r\nnature, but what other partes, vertues or vices, are contained in the\r\ncompasse of this monster, God onely knoweth, who, peradventure, hath\r\npermitted it to live uppon the face of the earth, for no other cause but\r\nto be a punishment and scourge unto mankind; and an evident example of\r\nhis owne wrathfull power to everlasting destruction. And this much may\r\nserve for a description of this beast, untill by God’s providence, more\r\ncan be known thereof.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNICORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a curious belief was that of the Unicorn! Yet what mythical animal\r\nis more familiar to Englishmen? In its present form it was not known to\r\nthe ancients, not even to Pliny, whose idea of the Monoceros or Unicorn\r\nis peculiar. He describes this animal as having “the head of a stag, the\r\nfeet of an elephant, the tail of the boar, while the rest of the body\r\nis like that of the horse: it makes a deep lowing noise, and has a\r\nsingle black horn, which projects from the middle of its forehead, two\r\ncubits in length. This animal, it is said, cannot be taken alive.”\r\n\r\nUntil James VI. of Scotland ascended the English throne as James I., the\r\nUnicorn, as it is now heraldically portrayed (which was a supporter to\r\nthe arms of James IV.) was almost unknown--vide _Tempest_, iii. 3. 20:--\r\n\r\n    “_Alonzo._ Give us kind keepers, heavens: what were these?\r\n\r\n    _Sebastian._ A living drollery. Now I will believe that there are\r\n    unicorns.”\r\n\r\nSpenser, who died before the accession of James I., and therefore did\r\nnot write about the supporters of the Royal Arms, alludes (in his\r\n_Faerie Queene_) to the antagonism between the Lion and the Unicorne.\r\n\r\n    “Likë as the lyon, whose imperial poure\r\n    A proud rebellious unicorn defyes,\r\n    T’avoide the rash assault, and wrathful stoure\r\n    Of his fiers foe, him to a tree applyes,\r\n    And when him rouning in full course he spyes,\r\n    He slips aside: the whiles that furious beast,\r\n    His precious horne, sought of his enimyes,\r\n    Strikes in the stroke, ne thence can be released,\r\n    But to the victor yields a bounteous feast.”\r\n\r\nPliny makes no mention of the Unicorn as we have it heraldically\r\nrepresented, but speaks of the Indian Ass, which, he says, is only a\r\none-horned animal. Other old naturalists, with the exception of Ælian,\r\ndo not mention it as our Unicorn--and his description of it hardly\r\ncoincides. He says that the Brahmins tell of the wonderful beasts in the\r\ninaccessible regions of the interior of India, among them being the\r\nUnicorn, “which they call _Cartazonon_, and say that it reaches the\r\nsize of a horse of mature age, possesses a mane and reddish-yellow hair,\r\nand that it excels in swiftness through the excellence of its feet and\r\nof its whole body. Like the elephant it has inarticulate feet, and it\r\nhas a boar’s tail; one black horn projects between the eyebrows, not\r\nawkwardly, but with a certain natural twist, and terminating in a sharp\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGuillim, who wrote on heraldry in 1610, gives, in his Illustrations,\r\nindifferently the tail of this animal, as horse or ass; and, as might be\r\nexpected from one of his craft, magnifies the Unicorn exceedingly:--“The\r\nUnicorn hath his Name of his one Horn on his Forehead. There is another\r\nBeast of a huge Strength and Greatness, which hath but one Horn, but\r\nthat is growing on his Snout, whence he is called _Rinoceros_, and both\r\nare named _Monoceros_, or _One horned_. It hath been much questioned\r\namong Naturalists, which it is that is properly called the Unicorn: And\r\nsome hath made Doubt whether there be any such Beast as this, or no.\r\nBut the great esteem of his Horn (in many places to be seen) may take\r\naway that needless scruple....\r\n\r\n“Touching the invincible Nature of this Beast, _Job_ saith, ‘_Wilt thou\r\ntrust him because his Strength is great, and cast thy Labour unto him?\r\nWilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it\r\ninto thy Barn?_’ And his Vertue is no less famous than his Strength, in\r\nthat his Horn is supposed to be the most powerful Antidote against\r\nPoison: Insomuch as the general Conceit is, that the wild Beasts of the\r\nWilderness use not to drink of the Pools, for fear of the venemous\r\nSerpents there breeding, before the Unicorn hath stirred it with his\r\nHorn. Howsoever it be, this Charge may very well be a Representation\r\nboth of Strength or Courage, and also of vertuous Dispositions and\r\nAbility to do Good; for to have Strength of Body, without the Gifts and\r\ngood Qualities of the Mind, is but the Property of an Ox, but where both\r\nconcur, that may truly be called Manliness. And that these two should\r\nconsort together, the Ancients did signify, when they made this one\r\nWord, _Virtus_, to imply both the Strength of Body, and Vertue of the\r\nMind....\r\n\r\n“It seemeth, by a Question moved by _Farnesius_, That the Unicorn is\r\nnever taken alive; and the Reason being demanded, it is answered ‘That\r\nthe greatness of his Mind is such, that he chuseth rather to die than to\r\nbe taken alive: Wherein (saith he) the Unicorn and the valiant-minded\r\nSouldier are alike, which both contemn Death, and rather than they will\r\nbe compelled to undergo any base Servitude or Bondage, they will lose\r\ntheir Lives.’...\r\n\r\n“The Unicorn is an untameable Beast by Nature, as may be gathered from\r\nthe Words of _Job, chap. 39_, ‘_Will the Unicorn serve thee, or will he\r\ntarry by thy Crib? Can’st thou bind the Unicorn with his Band to labour\r\nin the Furrow, or will he plough the Valleys after thee?’_”\r\n\r\nTopsell dilates at great length on the Unicorn. He agrees with Spenser\r\nand Guillim, and says:--“These Beasts are very swift, and their legges\r\nhave no Articles (_joints_). They keep for the most part in the desarts,\r\nand live solitary in the tops of the Mountaines. There was nothing more\r\nhorrible than the voice or braying of it, for the voice is strain’d\r\nabove measure. It fighteth both with the mouth and with the heeles, with\r\nthe mouth biting like a Lyon, and with the heeles kicking like a\r\nHorse.... He feereth not Iron nor any yron Instrument (as _Isodorus_\r\nwriteth) and that which is most strange of all other, it fighteth with\r\nhis owne kind, yea even with the females unto death, except when it\r\nburneth in lust for procreation: but unto straunger Beasts, with whome\r\nhe hath no affinity in nature, he is more sotiable and familiar,\r\ndelighting in their company when they come willing unto him, never\r\nrising against them; but, proud of their dependence and retinue, keepeth\r\nwith them all quarters of league and truce; but with his female, when\r\nonce his flesh is tickled with lust, he groweth tame, gregall, and\r\nloving, and so continueth till she is filled and great with young, and\r\nthen returneth to his former hostility.”\r\n\r\nThere was a curious legend of the Unicorn, that it would, by its keen\r\nscent, find out a maiden, and run to her, laying its head in her lap.\r\nThis is often used as an emblem of the Virgin Mary, to denote her\r\npurity. The following is from the Bestiary of Philip de Thaun, and, as\r\nits old French is easily read, I have not translated it:--\r\n\r\n    “Monoceros est Beste, un corne ad en la teste,\r\n    Purceo ad si a nun, de buc ad façun;\r\n    Par Pucele est prise; or vez en quel guize.\r\n      Quant hom le volt cacer et prendre et enginner,\r\n    Si vent hom al forest ù sis riparis est;\r\n    Là met une Pucele hors de sein sa mamele,\r\n    Et par odurement Monosceros la sent;\r\n    Dunc vent à la Pucele, et si baiset la mamele,\r\n    En sein devant se dort, issi veut à sa mort;\r\n    Li hom suivent atant ki l’ocit en dormant\r\n    U trestont vif le prent, si fais puis sun talent.\r\n      Grant chose signifie.”...\r\n\r\nTopsell, of course, tells the story:--“It is sayd that Unicorns above\r\nall other creatures, doe reverence Virgines and young Maides, and that\r\nmany times at the sight of them they grow tame, and come and sleepe\r\nbeside them, for there is in their nature a certaine savor, wherewithall\r\nthe Unicornes are allured and delighted; for which occasion the _Indian_\r\nand _Ethiopian_ hunters use this stratagem to take the beast. They take\r\na goodly, strong, and beautifull young man, whom they dresse in the\r\nApparell of a woman, besetting him with divers odoriferous flowers and\r\nspices.\r\n\r\n“The man so adorned they set in the Mountaines or Woods, where the\r\nUnicorne hunteth, so as the wind may carrie the savor to the beast, and\r\nin the meane season the other hunters hide themselves: the Unicorne\r\ndeceaved with the outward shape of a woman, and sweete smells, cometh to\r\nthe young man without feare, and so suffereth his head to bee covered\r\nand wrapped within his large sleeves, never stirring, but lying still\r\nand asleepe, as in his most acceptable repose. Then, when the hunters,\r\nby the signe of the young man, perceave him fast and secure, they come\r\nuppon him, and, by force, cut off his horne, and send him away alive:\r\nbut, concerning this opinion wee have no elder authoritie than\r\n_Tzetzes_, who did not live above five hundred yeares agoe, and\r\ntherefore I leave the reader to the freedome of his owne judgment, to\r\nbelieve or refuse this relation; neither is it fit that I should omit\r\nit, seeing that all writers, since the time of _Tzetzes_, doe most\r\nconstantly beleeve it.\r\n\r\n“It is sayd by _Ælianus_ and _Albertus_, that, except they bee taken\r\nbefore they bee two yeares old they will never bee tamed; and that the\r\nThrasians doe yeerely take some of their Colts, and bring them to their\r\nKing, which he keepeth for combat, and to fight with one another; for\r\nwhen they are old, they differ nothing at all from the most barbarous,\r\nbloodie, and ravenous beasts. Their flesh is not good for meate, but is\r\nbitter and unnourishable.”\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while to go into all the authorities treating of the\r\nUnicorn; suffice it to say, that it was an universal belief that there\r\nwere such animals in existence, for were not their horns in proof\r\nthereof? and were they not royal presents fit for the mightiest of\r\npotentates to send as loving pledges one to another? for it was one of\r\nthe most potent of medicines, and a sure antidote to poison. And they\r\nwere very valuable, too, for Paul Hentzner--who wrote in the time of\r\nQueen Elizabeth--says that, at Windsor Castle, he was shown, among other\r\nthings, the horn of an Unicorn of above eight spans and a half in\r\nlength, _i.e._, about 6½ feet, valued at £10,000. Considering that money\r\nwas worth then about three times what it is now, an Unicorn’s horn was a\r\nright royal gift.\r\n\r\nTopsell, from whom I have quoted so much, is especially voluminous and\r\nerudite on Unicorns; indeed, in no other old or new author whom I have\r\nconsulted are there so many facts (?) respecting this fabled beast to be\r\nfound. Here is his history of those horns then to be found in Europe:--\r\n\r\n“There are two of these at _Venice_ in the Treasurie of S. _Marke’s_\r\nChurch, as _Brasavolus_ writeth, one at _Argentoratum_, which is\r\nwreathed about with divers sphires.[30] There are also two in the\r\nTreasurie of the King of _Polonia_, all of them as long as a man in his\r\nstature. In the yeare 1520, there was found the horne of a _Unicorne_ in\r\nthe river _Arrula_, neare _Bruga_ in Helvetia, the upper face or out\r\nside whereof was a darke yellow; it was two cubites (_3 feet_) in\r\nlength, but had upon it no plights[31] or wreathing versuus. It was very\r\nodoriferous (especially when any part of it was set on fire), so that it\r\nsmelt like muske: as soone as it was found, it was carried to a Nunnery\r\ncalled _Campus regius_, but, afterwards by the Governor of _Helvetia_,\r\nit was recovered back againe, because it was found within his\r\nteritorie....\r\n\r\n“Another certaine friend of mine, being a man worthy to be beleeved,\r\ndeclared unto me that he saw at _Paris_, with the Chancellor, being Lord\r\nof _Pratus_, a peece of a Unicorn’s horn, to the quantity of a cubit,\r\nwreathed in tops or spires, about the thicknesse of an indifferent\r\nstaffe (the compasse therof extending to the quantity of six fingers)\r\nbeing within, and without, of a muddy colour, with a solide substance,\r\nthe fragments whereof would boile in the Wine although they were never\r\nburned, having very little or no smell at all therein.\r\n\r\n“When _Joannes Ferrerius_ of _Piemont_ had read these thinges, he wrote\r\nunto me, that, in the Temple of _Dennis_, neare unto _Paris_, that there\r\nwas a Unicorne’s horne six foot long, ... but that in bignesse, it\r\nexceeded the horne at the Citty of _Argentorate_, being also holow\r\nalmost a foot from that part which sticketh unto the forehead of the\r\nBeast, this he saw himselfe in the Temple of S. _Dennis_, and handled\r\nthe horne with his handes as long as he would. I heare that in the\r\nformer yeare (which was from the yeare of our Lord), 1553, when\r\n_Vercella_ was overthrown by the French, there was broght from that\r\ntreasure unto the King of France, a very great Unicorn’s horne, the\r\nprice wherof was valued at fourscore thousand Duckets.[32]\r\n\r\n“_Paulus Poæius_ describeth an Unicorne in this manner; That he is a\r\nbeast, in shape much like a young Horse, of a dusty colour, with a maned\r\nnecke, a hayry beard, and a forehead armed with a Horne of the quantity\r\nof two Cubits, being seperated with pale tops or spires, which is\r\nreported by the smoothnes and yvorie whitenesse thereof, to have the\r\nwonderfull power of dissolving and speedy expelling of all venome or\r\npoison whatsoever.\r\n\r\n“For his horne being put into the water, driveth away the poison, that\r\nhe may drinke without harme, if any venemous beast shall drinke therein\r\nbefore him. This cannot be taken from the Beast, being alive, for as\r\nmuch as he cannot possible be taken by any deceit: yet it is usually\r\nseene that the horne is found in the desarts, as it happeneth in Harts,\r\nwho cast off their olde horne thorough the inconveniences of old age,\r\nwhich they leave unto the Hunters, Nature renewing an other unto them.\r\n\r\n“The horne of this beast being put upon the Table of Kinges, and set\r\namongest their junkets and bankets, doeth bewray the venome, if there be\r\nany suche therein, by a certaine sweat which commeth over it. Concerning\r\nthese hornes, there were two seene, which were two cubits in length, of\r\nthe thicknesse of a man’s Arme, the first at _Venice_, which the Senate\r\nafterwards sent for a gift unto _Solyman_ the Turkish Emperor: the other\r\nbeing almost of the same quantity, and placed in a Sylver piller, with a\r\nshorte or cutted[33] point, which _Clement_ the Pope or Bishop of\r\n_Rome_, being come unto _Marssels_ brought unto _Francis_ the King, for\r\nan excellent gift.”... They adulterated the real article, for sale.\r\n“_Petrus Bellonius_ writeth, that he knewe the tooth of some certaine\r\nBeast, in time past, sold for the horne of a Unicorne (what beast may be\r\nsignified by this speech I know not, neither any of the French men which\r\ndo live amongst us) and so smal a peece of the same, being adulterated,\r\nsold ‘sometimes for 300 Duckets.’ But, if the horne shall be true and\r\nnot counterfait, it doth, notwithstanding, seeme to be of that creature\r\nwhich the Auncientes called by the name of an Unicorne, especially\r\n_Ælianus_, who only ascribeth to the same this wonderfull force against\r\npoyson and most grievous diseases, for he maketh not this horne white as\r\nours doth seeme, but outwardly red, inwardly white, and in the Middest\r\nor secretest part only blacke.”\r\n\r\nHaving dilated so long upon the Unicorn, it would be a pity not to give\r\nsome idea of the curative properties of its horn--always supposing that\r\nit could be obtained genuine, for there were horrid suspicions abroad\r\nthat it might be “the horne of some other beast brent in the fire, some\r\ncertaine sweet odors being thereunto added, and also imbrued in some\r\ndelicious and aromaticall perfume. Peradventure also, Bay by this means,\r\nfirst burned, and afterwards quenched, or put out with certaine sweet\r\nsmelling liquors.” To be of the proper efficacy it should be taken new,\r\nbut its power was best shown in testing poisons, when it sweated, as did\r\nalso a stone called “the Serpent’s tongue.” And the proper way to try\r\nwhether it was genuine or not, was to give Red Arsenic or Orpiment to\r\ntwo pigeons, and then to let them drink of two samples; if genuine, no\r\nharm would result--if adulterated, or false, the pigeons would die.\r\n\r\nIt was also considered a cure for Epilepsy, the Pestilent Fever or\r\nPlague, Hydrophobia, Worms in the intestines, Drunkenness, &c.,\r\n&c.,--and it also made the teeth clean and white;--in fact, it had so\r\nmany virtues that “no home should be without it.”\r\n\r\nAnd all this about a Narwhal’s horn!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true Unicorn is, of course, the Rhinoceros, and this picture of it\r\nis as early an one as I can find, being taken from Aldrovandus de Quad,\r\nA.D. 1521. Gesner and Topsell both reproduce it, at later dates, but\r\n_reversed_. The latter says that Gesner drew it from the life at\r\nLisbon--but having Aldrovandus and the others before me, I am bound to\r\ngive the palm to the former, and confess the others to be piracies. It\r\nis certain, however, that whoever drew this picture of a Rhinoceros must\r\nhave seen one, either living or stuffed, for it is not too bizarre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTopsell approaches this animal with an awe and reverence, such as he\r\nnever shows towards any other beast; indeed, he gets quite solemn over\r\nit, and he thus commences his _Apologia_:--“But for my part, which write\r\nthe English story, I acknowledge that no man must looke for that at my\r\nhands, which I have not received from some other: for I would bee\r\nunwilling to write anything untrue, or uncertaine out of mine owne\r\ninvention; and truth on every part is so deare unto mee, that I will not\r\nlie to bring any man in love and admiration with God and his works, for\r\nGod needeth not the lies of men: To conclude, therefore, this Præface,\r\nas the beast is strange, and never seene in our countrey, so my eyesight\r\ncannot adde anything to the description; therefore harken unto that\r\nwhich I have observed out of other writers.”\r\n\r\nThey were very rare beasts, among the early Roman Emperors, but in the\r\nlater Empire they were introduced into the Circus, but many centuries\r\nrolled on before we, in England, were favoured with a sight of this\r\ngreat animal. Topsell had not seen one, and he wrote in 1607, so we\r\naccept his _Apologia_ with all his errors:--“_Oppianus_ saith that there\r\nwas never yet any distinction of sexes in these _Rhinocerotes_; for all\r\nthat ever have been found were males, and not females, but from hence\r\nlet no body gather that there are no females, for it were impossible\r\nthat the breede should continue without females.\r\n\r\n“When they are to fight they whet their horne upon a stone, and there\r\nis not only a discord between these beasts and Elephants for their food,\r\nbut a natural description and enmity: for it is confidently affirmed,\r\nthat when the Rhinoceros which was at _Lisborne_, was brought into the\r\npresence of an Elephant, the Elephant ran away from him. How and what\r\nplace he overcometh the Elephant, we have shewed already in his story,\r\nnamely, how he fastneth his horne in the soft part of the Elephantes\r\nbelly. He is taken by the same meanes that the _Unicorne_ is taken, for\r\nit is said by _Albertus_, _Isodorus_, and _Alumnus_, that above all\r\nother creatures they love Virgins, and that unto them they will come be\r\nthey never so wilde, and fall a sleepe before them, so being asleepe\r\nthey are easily taken, and carried away. All the later Physitians do\r\nattribute the vertue of the _Unicorn’s_ horne to the _Rhinocereos_\r\nhorn.”\r\n\r\nSer Marco Polo, speaking of Sumatra, or, as he called it, Java the Less,\r\nsays in that island there are numerous unicorns. “They have hair like\r\nthat of a buffalo, feet like those of an elephant, and a horn in the\r\nmiddle of the forehead, which is black and very thick. They do no\r\nmischief, however, with the horn, but with the tongue alone; for this is\r\ncovered all over with long and strong prickles, (and when savage with\r\nany one they crush him under their knees, and then rasp him with their\r\ntongue). The head resembles that of a wild boar, and they carry it ever\r\nbent towards the ground. They delight much to abide in mire and mud.\r\n’Tis a passing ugly beast to look upon, and is not in the least like\r\nthat which our stories tell us of as being caught in the lap of a\r\nvirgin; in fact, ’tis altogether different from what we fancied.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GULO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus thus describes the Gulo or Gulon:--“Amongst all creatures\r\nthat are thought to be insatiable in the Northern parts of _Sweden_, the\r\n_Gulo_ hath his name to be the principall; and in the vulgar tongue they\r\ncall him _Jerff_, but in the _German_ language _Vielfras_; in the\r\nSclavonish speech _Rossamaka_, from his much eating, and the Latin name\r\nis _Gulo_, for he is so called from his gluttony. He is as great as a\r\ngreat Dog, and his ears and face are like a Cat’s: his feet and nails\r\nare very sharp; his body is hairy, with long brown hair, his tail is\r\nlike the Foxes, but somewhat shorter, but his hair is thicker, and of\r\nthis they make brave Winter Caps. Wherefore this Creature is the most\r\nvoracious; for, when he finds a carcasse, he devours so much, that his\r\nbody, by over-much meat, is stretched like a Drum, and finding a\r\nstreight (_narrow_) passage between Trees, he presseth between them,\r\nthat he may discharge his body by violence; and being thus emptied, he\r\nreturns to the carcasse, and fills himself top full; and then he\r\npresseth again through the same narrow passage, and goes back to the\r\ncarkasse, till he hath devoured it all; and then he hunts eagerly for\r\nanother. It is supposed he was created by nature to make men blush, who\r\neat and drink till they spew, and then feed again, eating day and night,\r\nas _Mechovita_ thinks in his _Sarmatia_. The flesh of this Creature is\r\naltogether uselesse for man’s food; but his skin is very commodious and\r\npretious. For it is of a white brown black colour, like a damask cloth\r\nwrought with many figures; and it shews the more beautiful, as by the\r\nIndustry of the Artist it is joyn’d with other garments in the likenesse\r\nor colour. Princes and great men use this habit in Winter, made like\r\nCoats; because it quickly breeds heat, and holds it long; and that not\r\nonely in _Swethland_, and _Gothland_, but in _Germany_, where the rarity\r\nof these skins makes them to be more esteemed, when it is prised in\r\nships among other Merchandise.\r\n\r\n“The Inhabitants are not content to let these skins be transported into\r\nother Countries, because, in Winter, they use to entertain their more\r\nnoble guests in these skins; which is a sufficient argument that they\r\nthink nothing more comely and glorious, than to magnifie at all times,\r\nand in all orders their good guests, and that in the most vehement cold,\r\nwhen amongst other good turns they cover their beds with these skins.\r\n\r\n“And I do not think fit to overpasse, that when men sleep under these\r\nskins, they have dreams that agree with the nature of that Creature, and\r\nhave an insatiable stomach, and lay snares for other Creatures, and\r\nprevent them themselves. It may be that it is as they that eat hot\r\nSpices, Ginger or Pepper seem to be inflamed; and they that eat Sugar\r\nseem to be choked in water. There seems to be another secret of Nature\r\nin it, that those who are clothed in those Skins, seem never to be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n“The guts of this Creatures are made into strings for Musicians, and\r\ngive a harsh sound, which the Natives take pleasure in; but these,\r\ntempered with sweet sounding strings, will make very good Musick. Their\r\nhoofs made like Circles, and set upon heads subject to the Vertigo, and\r\nringing ears, soon cure them. The Hunters drink the blood of this beast\r\nmingled with hot water; also seasoned with the best Honey, it is drunk\r\nat Marriages. The fat, or tallow of it, smeered on putrid Ulcers for an\r\nointment is a sudden cure. Charmers use the teeth of it. The hoofs,\r\nnewly taken off, will drive away Cats and Dogs, if they do but see it,\r\nas birds fly away, if they spy but the Vultur or the Bustard.\r\n\r\n“By the Hunter’s various Art, this Creature is taken onely in regard of\r\nhis pretious skin; and the way is this;--They carry into the wood a\r\nfresh Carkasse; where these beasts are wont to be most commonly;\r\nespecially in the deep snows (for in Summer their skins are nothing\r\nworth) when he smels this he falls upon it, and eats till he is forced\r\nto crush his belly close between narrow trees, which is not without\r\npain; the Hunter, in the mean time, shoots, and kills him with an arrow.\r\n\r\n“There is another way to catch this Beast, for they set Trees, bound\r\nasunder with small cords, and these fly up when they eat the Carkasse,\r\nand strangle them; or else he is taken, falling into pits dug upon one\r\nside, if the Carkasse be cast in, and he is compelled by hunger to feed\r\nupon it. And there is hardly any other way to catch him with dogs, since\r\nhis claws are so sharp, that dogs dare not encounter with him, that\r\nfear not to set upon the most fierce Wolves.”\r\n\r\nOf this animal Topsell says:--“This beast was not known by the ancients,\r\nbut hath bin since discovered in the Northern parts of the world, and\r\nbecause of the great voracity thereof, it is called _Gulo_, that is, a\r\ndevourer; in imitation of the Germans, who call such devouring Creatures\r\n_Vilsruff_, and the Swedians _Cerff_, and in _Lituania_ and _Muscovia_\r\nit is called _Rossomokal_. It is thought to be engendered by a _Hyæna_\r\nand a _Lionesse_, for in quality it resembleth a _Hyæna_, and it is the\r\nsame which is called _Crocuta_: it is a devouring and unprofitable\r\ncreature having sharper teeth than other creatures. Some thinke it is\r\nderived from a wolf and a dog, for it is about the bignesse of a dog. It\r\nhath the face of a Cat, the body and taile of a Foxe; being black of\r\ncolour; his feet and nailes be most sharp, his skin rusty, the haire\r\nvery sharp, and it feedeth upon dead carkases.”\r\n\r\nHe then describes its manner of feeding, evidently almost literally\r\ncopying Olaus Magnus, and thus continues:--“There are of these beastes\r\ntwo kindes, distinguished by coulour, one blacke, and the other like a\r\nWolfe: they seldom kill a man or any live beastes, but feede upon\r\ncarrion and dead carkasses, as is before saide, yet, sometimes, when\r\nthey are hungry, they prey upon beastes, as horses and such like, and\r\nthen they subtlely ascend up into a tree, and when they see a beast\r\nunder the same, they leape downe upon him and destroy him. A Beare is\r\nafraide to meete them, and unable to match them, by reason of their\r\nsharpe teeth.\r\n\r\n“This beast is tamed, and nourished, in the courts of Princes, for no\r\nother cause than for an example of incredible voracitie. When he hath\r\nfilled his belly, if he can find no trees growing so neare another, as\r\nby sliding betwixte them, hee may expell his excrements, then taketh he\r\nan Alder-tree, and with his forefeete rendeth the same asunder, and\r\npasseth through the middest of it, for the cause aforesaid. When they\r\nare wilde, men kill them with bowes and guns, for no other cause than\r\nfor their skins, which are pretious and profitable, for they are white\r\nspotted, changeably interlined like divers flowers, for which cause the\r\ngreatest princes, and richest nobles use them in garments in the Winter\r\ntime; such are the Kings of _Polonia_, _Swede-land_, _Goat-land_, and\r\nthe princes of _Germany_. Neither is there any skinne which will sooner\r\ntake a colour, or more constantly retaine it. The outward appearance of\r\nthe saide skinne is like to a damaskt garment, and besides this outward\r\nparte there is no other memorable thing woorthy observation in this\r\nravenous beast, and therefore, in _Germany_, it is called a foure-footed\r\nVulture.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Glutton or Wolverine, which is not unlike a\r\nsmall bear, can consume (while in confinement) thirteen pounds of meat\r\nin a day. In its wild state, if the animal it has killed is too large\r\nfor present consumption, it carries away the surplus, and stores it up\r\nin a secure hiding-place, for future eating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Pliny not only uses all Aristotle’s matter anent Bears, but puts it\r\nin a consecutive, and more readable form, it is better to transcribe his\r\nversion than that of the older author.\r\n\r\n“Bears couple in the beginning of winter. The female then retires by\r\nherself to a separate den, and then brings forth, on the thirtieth day,\r\nmostly five young ones. When first born, they are shapeless masses of\r\nwhite flesh, a little larger than mice; their claws alone being\r\nprominent. The mother then licks them into proper shape.[34] The male\r\nremains in his retreat for forty days, the female four months. If they\r\nhappen to have no den, they construct a retreat with branches and\r\nshrubs, which is made impenetrable to the rain, and is lined with soft\r\nleaves. During the first fourteen days they are overcome by so deep a\r\nsleep, that they cannot be aroused by wounds even. They become\r\nwonderfully fat, too, while in this lethargic state. This fat is much\r\nused in medicine, and it is very useful in preventing the hair from\r\nfalling off.[35] At the end of these fourteen days they sit up, and find\r\nnourishment by sucking their fore paws. They warm their cubs, when cold,\r\nby pressing them to the breast, not unlike the way in which birds brood\r\nover their eggs. It is a very astonishing thing, but Theophrastus\r\nbelieves it, that if we preserve the flesh of the bear, the animal being\r\nkilled in its dormant state, it will increase in bulk, even though it\r\nmay have been cooked. During this period no signs of food are to be\r\nfound in the stomach of the animal, and only a very slight quantity of\r\nliquid; there are a few drops of blood only, near the heart, but none\r\nwhatever in any other part of the body. They leave their retreat in the\r\nspring, the males being remarkably fat; of this circumstance, however,\r\nwe cannot give any satisfactory explanation, for the sleep, during which\r\nthey increase so much in bulk, lasts, as we have already stated, only\r\nfourteen days. When they come out, they eat a certain plant, which is\r\nknown as _Aros_, in order to relax the bowels, which would otherwise\r\nbecome in a state of constipation; and they sharpen the edges of their\r\nteeth against the young shoots of the trees.\r\n\r\n“Their eyesight is dull, for which reason in especial, they seek the\r\ncombs of bees, in order that from the bees stinging them in the throat,\r\nand drawing blood, the oppression in the head may be relieved. The head\r\nof the bear is extremely weak, whereas, in the lion, it is remarkable\r\nfor its strength: on which account it is, that when the bear, impelled\r\nby any alarm, is about to precipitate itself from a rock, it covers its\r\nhead with its paws. In the arena of the Circus they are often to be seen\r\nkilled by a blow on the head with the fist. The people of Spain have a\r\nbelief, that there is some kind of magical poison in the brain of the\r\nbear, and therefore burn the heads of those that have keen killed in\r\ntheir public games; for it is averred, that the brain, when mixed with\r\ndrink, produces, in man, the rage of the bear.\r\n\r\n“These animals walk on two feet, and climb trees backwards. They can\r\novercome the bull, by suspending themselves, by all four legs, from his\r\nmuzzle and horns, thus wearing out its powers by their weight. In no\r\nother animal is stupidity found more adroit in devising mischief.”\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus, in writing about bears, gives precedence to the white, or\r\nArctic bear, and gives an insight into the religious life of the old\r\nNorsemen, who, when converted, thought their most precious things none\r\ntoo good for the “Church.” If we consider the risk run in obtaining a\r\nwhite bear’s skin, and the privations and cold endured in getting it, we\r\nmay look upon it as a Norse treasure. “Silver and Gold have I none; but\r\nsuch as I have, give I unto thee.” He gives a short, but truthful\r\naccount of their habits, and winds up his all too brief narration\r\nthus:--“These white Bear Skins are wont to be offered by the Hunters,\r\nfor the high Altars of Cathedrals, or Parochial Churches, that the\r\nPriest celebrating Mass standing, may not take cold of his feet, when\r\nthe Weather is extream cold. In the Church at _Nidrosum_, which is the\r\nMetropolis of the Kingdom of _Norway_, every year such white Skins are\r\nfound, that are faithfully offered by the Hunters Devotion, whensoever\r\nthey take them, and Wolves-Skins to buy Wax-Lights, and to burn them in\r\nhonour of the Saints.”\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus is very veracious in his dealings with White Bears, but he\r\nmorally retrogrades when he touches upon the Black and Brown Bears. The\r\nillustrations of this portion of Olaus Magnus are exceedingly graphic.\r\nIn treating of the cunning used in killing bears, he says:--“In killing\r\nblack and cruel Bears in the Northern Kingdoms, they use this way,\r\nnamely, that when, in Autumn the Bear feeds on certain red ripe Fruit\r\n(_Query Cranberries_) on trees that grow in Clusters like Grapes, either\r\ngoing up into the Trees, or standing on the ground, and pulling down the\r\nTrees, the cunning Hunter, with broad Arrows from a Crosse-bow shoots\r\nat him, and these pierce deep; and he is so suddenly moved with this\r\nfright, and wound received, that he presently voids backward all the\r\nFruit he ate, as Hailstones; and presently runs upon an Image of a man\r\nmade of wood, that is set purposely before him, and rends and tears\r\nthat, till another Arrow hit him, that gives him his death’s wound, shot\r\nby the Hunter that hides himself behind some Stone or Tree. For when he\r\nhath a wound, he runs furiously, at the sight of his blood, against all\r\nthings in his way, and especially the Shee-Bear, when she suckleth her\r\nWhelps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The Bears watch diligently for the passing of Deer; and chiefly, the\r\nShee-Bear when she hath brought forth her Whelps; who not so much for\r\nHunger, as for fearing of losing her Whelps, is wont to fall cruelly\r\nupon all she meets. For, she being provoked by any violence, far exceeds\r\nthe force of the He-Bear, and Craft, that she may revenge the loss of\r\nher Young. For she lyes hid amongst the thick boughs of Trees, and\r\nyoung Shoots; and if a Deer, trusting to the glory of his horns, or\r\nquick smell, or swift running, come too neare that place unawares, she\r\nsuddenly falls out upon him to kill him; and if he first defend himself\r\nwith his horns, yet he is so tired with the knots and weight of them,\r\nbeing driven by the rage of the Bear, that he is beaten to the ground,\r\nthat losing force and life, he falls down a prey to be devoured. Then\r\nshe will set upon the Bull with his horns, using the same subtilty, and\r\ncasts herself upon his back; and when the Bull strives with his horns to\r\ncast off the Bear, and to defend himself, she fasteneth on his horns and\r\nshoulders with her paws, till, weary of the weight he falls down dead.\r\nThen laying the Bull on his back like a Wallet, she goes on two feet\r\ninto the secret places of the Woods to feed upon him. But when, in\r\nWinter she is hunted, she is betrayed by Dogs, or by the prints of her\r\nfeet in the Snow, and can hardly escape from the Hunters that run about\r\nher from all sides.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMagnus then retails the usual fables about bears licking their young\r\ninto shape, their building houses, &c., &c., after which he discourses\r\nabout the bear and hedgehog, a story which has nothing to do with the\r\npicture. It is described as “the Battail between the Hedge-Hog, and the\r\nBear.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Though the _Urchin_ have sharp pointed prickles, whereby he gathereth\r\nApples to feed on, and these he hides in hollow Trees, molesting the\r\n_Bear_ in his Den: yet is he oppressed by the cunning and weight of the\r\n_Bear_: namely when the Urchin roles himself up round as a ball, that\r\nthere is nothing but his prickles to come at: yet with this means he\r\ncannot prevail against the _Bear_, which opens him, to revenge the wrong\r\nhe did her in violating her Lodging. Nor can the _Bear_ eat the\r\n_Hedge-Hog_, it is such miserable poor and prickly meat. Wherefore\r\nreturning again into his Cave, he sleeps, and grows fat, living by\r\nsucking his paw.\r\n\r\n“The _Bears_ also fight against the _Bores_, but seldome get the\r\nvictory, because they can better defend themselves with their Tusks,\r\nthan the _Bull_ or the _Deer_ can by their Horns, or running swiftly.\r\nThe strong _Horses_ keep off the _Bears_ with their biting and kicking,\r\nfrom the _Mares_ that are great with _Foals_. Young _Colts_ save\r\nthemselves by running, but they will always hold this fear, and so\r\nbecome unprofitable for the Wars. Wherefore they use this stratagem:\r\nsome Souldier puts on a Bear’s skin, and meets them, by reason that they\r\nare horses that the Bears have hunted.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Northern Bears seem to have been wonderful creatures, for they used\r\nto go mad after eating Mandragora, and then they were in the habit of\r\nmaking a meal off ants, by way of recovering their sanity. They were\r\nthen, as now, noted for their love of honey, and this illustration\r\ndepicts them as coming out of, and going into the ground after bees and\r\nhoney; nay, it would seem as if they even invaded the barrels put up in\r\nthe trees to serve as hives. But man was more cunning than they, and a\r\ngood bear-skin in those cold regions, had a value far exceeding honey.\r\n\r\n“Since that in the Northern Countries, especially _Podolia_, _Russia_,\r\nand places adjacent, because of the great multitude of Bees, the Hives\r\nat home will not contain them, the Inhabitants willingly let them fly\r\nunto hollow Trees, made so by Nature, or by Art, that they may increase\r\nthere. Wherefore mortal stratagems are thus prepared for Bears, that use\r\nto steal honey (for they having a most weak head, as a Lion hath the\r\nstrongest, for sometimes they will be killed with a blow under their\r\near); namely a Woodden Club set round with Iron points is hung over the\r\nhole the Bees come forth of, from some high bough, or otherwise; and\r\nthis, being cast upon the head of the greedy Bear that is going to steal\r\nthe honey, kills him striving against it; so he loseth his life, flesh,\r\nand skin to the Master, for a little honey. Their flesh is salted up\r\nlike Hog’s flesh, Stag’s flesh, Elk’s, or Ranged deer’s flesh, to eat in\r\nCamps, and the Tallow of them is good to cure any wounds.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEvery one of my readers, who is not a Scotsman, will appreciate the\r\ndelicate musical taste of the bear, in the matter of bagpipes--Bruin\r\ncannot stand the skirling, and, in the illustration, seems to be\r\nremonstrating with the piper.\r\n\r\n“It is well enough known that Bears, Dolphins, Stags, Sheep, Calves and\r\nLambs, are much delighted with Musick: and, again, they are to be driven\r\nfrom their Heards by some harsh sounding Pipes, or Horns, that when they\r\nhear the sound they will be gone into the Woods, a great way off. Now\r\nthe Shepheards of the Cattel know this well enough: they will play upon\r\ntheir two horned Pipes continually, which sometimes are taken away by\r\nBears, until such time as the Bear is forced by Hunger to go away to get\r\nhis food. Wherefore they take a Goat’s Horn, and sometimes a Cow’s Horn,\r\nand make such a horrid noise, that they scare the wild beasts, and so\r\nreturn safe to their dispersed flocks. This two horned Pipe, which in\r\ntheir tongue they call _Seec-Pipe_, they carry to the fields with them,\r\nfor they have learned by use, that their Flocks and Heards will feed the\r\nbetter and closer together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The _Russians_ and _Lithuanians_ are more near to the Swedes and Goths\r\non the Eastern parts: and these hold it a singular delight, to have\r\nalways the most cruel Beasts bred up tame with them, and made obedient\r\nto their commands in all things. Wherefore to do this the Sooner, they\r\nkeep them in Caves, or tyed with Chains, chiefly Bears newly taken in\r\nthe Woods, and half starve them; and they appoint one or two Masters,\r\ncloathed one like the other, to carry Victuals to them, that they may be\r\naccustomed to play with them, and handle them when they are loose. Also\r\nthey play on Pipes sweetly, and with this they are much taken: and thus\r\nthey use them to sport and dance, and then, when the Pipes sound\r\ndifferently, they are taught to lift up their legs, as by a more sharp\r\nsign, to end the Dance with, that they may go on their hinder feet, with\r\na Cap in their fore feet, held out to the Women and Maids, and others\r\nthat saw them dance, and ask a reward for their dancing; and, if it is\r\nnot given freely, they will murmure, as they are directed by their\r\nMaster, and will nod their heads, as desiring them to give more money:\r\nSo the Master of these Bears, that cannot speak the language of other\r\ncountries, will get a good gain by his dumb Beast. Nor doth this seem to\r\nbe done onely because that these should live by this small gain; for the\r\nBearherds that lead these Bears, are, at least, ten or twelve lusty men;\r\nand in their company, sometimes, there go Noblemen’s sons, that they may\r\nlearn the manners, fashions, and distances of places, the Military Arts,\r\nand Concord of Princes, by these merry Pastimes. But since they were\r\nfound, in _Germany_, to spoil Travellers, and to cast them to their\r\nBears to eat, most strict Laws are made against them, that they may\r\nnever come there again.\r\n\r\n“There is another Sport, when Bears taken, are put into a Ship, and shew\r\nmerry pastimes in going up and down the Ropes, and sometimes are\r\nprofitable for some unexpected accident. For Histories of the\r\nProvincials mention, that it hapned, that one was thus freed from a\r\nPirate that was like to set upon him; for the Pirate coming on, was\r\nfrighted at it, when he saw afar off, men, as he supposed, going up and\r\ndown the Ropes, from the Top Mast, as the manner is to defend the Ship.\r\nWhereas they were but young Bears, playing on the Ropes. But the most\r\npleasant sight of all is, that when the Bears look out of the Ship into\r\nthe Waters, a great number of Sea Calves will come and gaze upon them,\r\nthat you would think an innumerable Company of Hogs swam about the Ship,\r\nand they are caught by the Sea men with long Spears, with Hooks, and a\r\nCord tyed to them; and so are also the other Beasts, that come to help\r\nthe Sea Calves, taken, and crying like to Hogs. Also the Bears are let\r\ndown to swim, that they may catch these wandering Sea-Calves, or else,\r\nwhen it thunders, and the weather is tempestuous, they be taken above\r\nWater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“But that tame Bears may not onely be kept unprofitably to feed, and\r\nmake sport, they are set to the Wheels in the Courts of great men, that\r\nthey may draw up Water out of deep Wells; and that in huge Vessels made\r\nfor this purpose, and they do not help alone this Way, but they are set\r\nto draw great Waggons, for they are very strong in their Legs, Claws,\r\nand Loins; nor is it unfit to make them go upright, and carry burdens of\r\nWood, and such like, to the place appointed, or they stand at great\r\nmen’s doors, to keep out other hurtful Creatures. When they are young,\r\nthey will play wonderfully with Boys, and do them no hurt.”\r\n\r\nTopsell goes through the usual stories of bears licking their cubs into\r\nshape, and subsisting by sucking their claws--but he also affords us\r\nmuch information about bears, which we do not find in modern Natural\r\nHistories:--“At what time they come abroad, being in the beginning of\r\nMay, which is the third moneth from the Spring. The old ones being\r\nalmost dazled with long darknes, comming into light againe, seeme to\r\nstagger and reele too and fro, and then for the straightnesse of their\r\nguts, by reason of their long fasting, doe eat the herbe _Arum_, called\r\nin English _Wake-Robbin_, or _Calves-foot_, being of very sharpe and\r\ntart taste, which enlargeth their guts, and so, being recovered, they\r\nremaine all the time their young are with them, more fierce, and cruell\r\nthan at other times. And concerning the same _Arum_, called also\r\n_Dracunculus_, and _Oryx_, there is a pleasant vulgar tale, whereby some\r\nhave conceived that Beares eat this herbe before their lying secret, and\r\nby vertue thereof (without meat, or sence of cold) they passe away the\r\nwhole winter in sleepe.\r\n\r\n“There was a certaine cow-heard, in the Mountains of _Helvetia_, which,\r\ncomming downe a hill, with a great caldron on his backe, he saw a beare\r\neating a root which he had pulled up with his feet; the cowheard stood\r\nstill till the beare was gone, and afterward came to the place where the\r\nbeast had eaten the same, and, finding more of the same roote, did\r\nlikewise eat it; he had no sooner tasted thereof, but he had such a\r\ndesire to sleepe, that hee could not containe himselfe, but he must\r\nneeds lie down in the way, and there fell a sleep, having covered his\r\nheade with the caldron, to keep himself from the vehemency of the colde,\r\nand there slept all the Winter time without harme, and never rose againe\r\ntill the spring time; which fable if a man will beleeve, then,\r\ndoubtlesse, this hearbe may cause the Beares to be sleepers, not for\r\nfourteene dayes, but for fourscore dayes together.\r\n\r\n“The ordinary food of Beares is fish; for the Water beare, and others\r\nwill eate fruites, Apples, Grapes, Leaves, and Pease, and will breake\r\ninto bee hives sucking out the honey; likewise Bees, Snayles and Emmets,\r\nand flesh, if it bee leane, or ready to putrifie; but, if a Beare doe\r\nchance to kill a swine, or a Bull, or Sheepe, he eateth them presentlie,\r\nwhereas other beasts eate not hearbes, if they eate flesh: likewise they\r\ndrinke water, but not like other beastes, neither sucking it, or lapping\r\nit, but as it were, even bitinge at it.\r\n\r\n“They are exceeding full of fat or Larde-greace, which some use\r\nsuperstitiouslie beaten with oile, wherewith they anoint their\r\ngrape-sickles when they go to vintage, perswading themselves that if no\r\nbodie knows thereof, their tender vine braunches shall never be consumed\r\nby catterpillers.\r\n\r\n“Others attribute this to the vertue of Beare’s blood, and\r\n_Theophrastus_ affirmeth, that if beare’s grease be kept in a vessell,\r\nat such time as the beares lie secret, it will either fill it up, or\r\ncause it to runne over. The flesh of beares is unfit for meate, yet some\r\nuse to eate it, after it hath been twice sodden; other eat it baked in\r\npasties, but the truth is, it is better for medicine than food.\r\n_Theophrastus_ likewise affirmeth, that at the time when beares lie\r\nsecret, their dead flesh encreaseth, which is kept in houses, but\r\nbeare’s fore feet are held for a verie delicate and well tasted foode,\r\nfull of sweetnes, and much used by the German Princes.\r\n\r\n“And because of the fiercenesse of this beast, they are seldome taken\r\nalive, except they be very young, so that some are killed in the\r\nMountaines by Poyson, the Country being so steepe and rocky that hunters\r\ncannot followe them; some taken in ditches of the earth and other\r\nginnes. _Oppianus_ relateth that neare _Tygris_ and _Armenia_, the\r\ninhabitauntes use this Stratigem to take Beares.\r\n\r\n“The people go often to the Wooddes to find the Denne of the Beare,\r\nfollowing a leam hound, whose nature is, so soone as he windeth the\r\nbeast, to barke, whereby his leader discovereth the prey, and so draweth\r\noff the hounde with the leame; then come the people in great multitude,\r\nand compasse him about with long nets, placing certaine men at each end:\r\nthen tie they a long rope to one side of the net, as high from the\r\nground, as the small of a Man’s belly; whereunto are fastned divers\r\nplumes and feathers of vultures, swannes, and other resplendant coloured\r\nbirdes, which, with the wind make a noise or hissing, turning over and\r\nglistering; on the other side of the net they build foure little hovels\r\nof greene boughes, wherein they lay foure men covered all over with\r\ngreene leaves; then, all being prepared, they sound their Trumpets, and\r\nwind their horns; at the noise whereof the beare ariseth, and in his\r\nfearefull rage runneth too and fro as if he sawe fire: the young men,\r\narmed, make unto him, the beare, looking round about, taketh the\r\nplainest way toward the rope hung full of feathers, which, being\r\nstirred, and haled by those that holde it, maketh the beare much affraid\r\nwith the ratling and hissing thereof, and so flying from that side halfe\r\nmad, runneth into the nets, where the keepers entrap him so cunningly,\r\nthat he seldome escapeth.\r\n\r\n“When a Beare is set upon by an armed man, he standeth upright, and\r\ntaketh the man betwixt his forefeet, but he, being covered all over with\r\nyron plates can receive no harm, and then may easily, with a sharpe\r\nknife or dagger pierce thorough the heart of the beast.\r\n\r\n“If a shee beare having young ones be hunted, shee driveth her Whelpes\r\nbefore her, untill they be wearied, and then, if she be not prevented,\r\nshe climbeth uppon a tree, carrying one of her young in her mouth, and\r\nthe other on her backe. A Beare will not willingly fight with a man,\r\nbut, being hurt by a man, he gnasheth his teeth, and licketh his\r\nforefeete, and it is reported by an Ambassador of _Poland_, that when\r\nthe _Sarmatians_ finde a beare, they inclose the whole Wood by a\r\nmultitude of people standing not above a cubit one from another; then\r\ncut they downe the outmost trees, so that they raise a Wall of wood to\r\nhemme in the Beares; this being effected, they raise the Beare, having\r\ncertaine forkes in their hands, made for that purpose, and, when the\r\nBeare approacheth, they, (with those forkes) fall upon him, one keeping\r\nhis head, another one leg, other his body, and so, with force, muzzle\r\nhim and tie his legges, leading him away. The Rhætians use this policy\r\nto take Wolves and Beares; they raise up great posts, and crosse them\r\nwith a long beame laded with heavy weightes, unto the which beame they\r\nfasten a corde with meat therein, whereunto the beast comming, and\r\nbiting at the meat, pulleth downe the beame upon her owne pate.\r\n\r\n“The inhabitants of _Helvetia_ hunt them with mastiffe Dogges, because\r\nthey should not kill their cattell left at large in the fielde in the\r\nday time; They likewise shoote them with gunnes, giving a good summe of\r\nmoney to them that can bring them a slaine beare. The _Sarmatians_ use\r\nto take Beares by this sleight; under those trees wherein bees breed,\r\nthey plant a great many of sharpe pointed stakes, putting one hard into\r\nthe hole wherein the bees go in and out, whereunto the Beare climbing,\r\nand comming to pull it forth, to the end that she may come to the hony,\r\nand being angry that the stake sticketh so fast in the hole, with\r\nviolence plucketh it foorth with both her fore feet, whereby she looseth\r\nher holde, and falleth downe upon the picked stakes, whereupon she\r\ndieth, if they that watch for her come not to take her off. There was\r\nreported by _Demetrius_, Ambassador at _Rome_, from the King of _Musco_,\r\nthat a neighbor of his, going to seek hony, fell into a hollow tree, up\r\nto the brest in hony, where he lay two days, being not heard by any man\r\nto complain; at length came a great Beare to this hony, and, putting his\r\nhead into the tree, the poore man tooke hold thereof, whereat, the\r\nBeare, suddenly affrighted, drew the man out of that deadly danger, and\r\nso ranne away for feare of a worse creature.\r\n\r\n“But, if there be no tree wherein Bees doe breed neere to the place\r\nwhere the Beare abideth, then they use to annoint some hollow place of a\r\ntree with hony, whereinto Bees will enter and make hony combes, and when\r\nthe Beare findeth them, she is killed as aforesaide. In _Norway_ they\r\nuse to saw the tree almost asunder, so that when the beast climbeth it,\r\nshe falleth downe upon piked stakes laid underneath to kill her; and\r\nsome make a hollow place in a tree, wherein they put a great pot of\r\nwater, having annointed it with hony, at the bottome wherof are fastened\r\ncertaine hookes bending downeward, leaving an easie passage for the\r\nbeare to thrust in her head to get the honie, but impossible to pull it\r\nfoorth againe alone, because the hookes take holde on her skinne; this\r\npot they binde fast to a tree, whereby the Beare is taken alive and\r\nblinde folded, and though her strength breake the corde or chaine\r\nwherewith the pot is fastened, yet can shee not escape or hurt any bodie\r\nin the taking, by reason her head is fastened in the pot.\r\n\r\n“To conclude, other make ditches or pits under Apple trees, laying upon\r\ntheir mouth rotten stickes, which they cover with earth, and strawe\r\nuppon it herbes, and when the beare commeth to the Apple tree, she\r\nfalleth into the pit and is taken.\r\n\r\n“The herbe _Wolfebaine_ or _Liberdine_ is poison to Foxes, Wolves, Dogs,\r\nand Beares, and to all beasts that are littered blind, as the _Alpine\r\nRhætians_ affirme. There is one kinde of this called _Cyclamine_, which\r\nthe _Valdensians_ call _Tora_, and with the juice thereof they poison\r\ntheir darts, whereof I have credibly received this story; That a certain\r\n_Valdensian_, seeing a wilde beare, having a dart poysond heerewith, did\r\ncast it at the beare, being farre from him, and lightly wounded her, it\r\nbeing no sooner done, but the beare ran to and fro in a wonderful\r\nperplexitie through the woods, unto a verie sharpe cliffe of a rocke,\r\nwhere the man saw her draw her last breath, as soon as the poison\r\nentered to her hart, as he afterward found by opening of her bodie. The\r\nlike is reported of henbane, another herb. But there is a certaine\r\nblacke fish in _Armenia_ full of poison, with the pouder whereof they\r\npoison figs, and cast them in those places where wilde beastes are most\r\nplentifull, which they eat, and so are killed.\r\n\r\n“Concerning the industrie or naturall disposition of a beare, it is\r\ncertaine that they are very hardlie tamed, and not to be trusted though\r\nthey seeme never so tame; for which cause there is a storie of _Diana_\r\nin _Lysias_, that there was a certaine beare made so tame, that it went\r\nuppe and downe among men, and woulde feede with them, taking meat at\r\ntheir handes, giving no occasion to feare or mistrust her cruelty; on a\r\ndaye, a young mayde playing with the Beare, lasciviously did so provoke\r\nit, that he tore her in pieces; the Virgin’s brethren seeing the\r\nmurther, with their Dartes slew the Beare, whereupon followed a great\r\npestilence through all that region: and when they consulted with the\r\nOracle, the paynim God gave answeare, that the plague could not cease\r\nuntill they dedicated some virginnes unto _Diana_ for the Beare’s sake\r\nthat was slaine; which, some interpreting that they should sacrifice\r\nthem, _Embarus_, upon condition the priesthoode might remaine in his\r\nfamily, slewe his onely daughter to end the pestilence, and for this\r\ncause the virgins were after dedicated to _Diana_ before their marriage,\r\nwhen they were betwixt ten and fifteene yeare olde, which was performed\r\nin the moneth of _January_, otherwise they could not be married: yet\r\nbeares are tamed for labours, and especially for sports among the\r\n_Roxalani_ and _Libians_, being taught to draw water with wheeles out of\r\nthe deepest wels; likewise stones upon sleds, to the building of wals.\r\n\r\n“A prince of _Lituania_ nourished a Beare very tenderly, feeding her\r\nfrom his table with his owne hand, for he had used her to be familiar in\r\nhis court, and to come into his owne chamber, when he listed, so that\r\nshe would goe abroad into the fields and woods, returning home againe of\r\nher owne accord, and with her hand or foote rub the Kinge’s chamber\r\ndoore to have it opened, when she was hungry, it being locked. It\r\nhappened that certaine young Noble men conspired the death of this\r\nPrince, and came to his chamber doore, rubbing it after the custome of\r\nthe beare, the King not doubting any evill, and supposing it had bene\r\nhis beare, opened the doore, and they presently slewe him....\r\n\r\n“There are many naturall operations in Beares. _Pliny_ reporteth, that,\r\nif a woman bee in sore travaile of child-birth, let a stone, or arrow,\r\nwhich hath killed a man, a beare, or a bore, be throwne over the house\r\nwherein the Woman is, and she shall be eased of her paine. There is a\r\nsmall worme called _Volvox_, which eateth the vine branches when they\r\nare young, but if the vine-sickles be annointed with Beare’s blood, that\r\nworme will never hurt them. If the blood or greace of a Beare be set\r\nunder a bed, it will draw unto it all the fleas, and so kill them by\r\ncleaving thereunto. But the vertues medicinall are very many; and first\r\nof all, the blood cureth all manner of bunches and apostems in the\r\nflesh, and bringeth haire upon the eyelids if the bare place be\r\nannointed therewith.\r\n\r\n“The fat of a Lyon is most hot and dry, and next to a Lyon’s a\r\nLeopard’s; next to a Leopard’s a Beare’s; and next to a Beare’s, a\r\nBul’s. The later Physitians use it to cure convulsed and distracted\r\nparts, spots, and tumors in the body. It also helpeth the paine of the\r\nloins, if the sicke part be annointed therewith, and all ulcers in the\r\nlegges or shinnes, when a plaister is made thereof with bole armoricke.\r\nAlso the ulcers of the feet, mingled with allome. It is soveraigne\r\nagainst the falling of the haire, compounded with wilde roses. The\r\nSpaniards burne the braines of beares, when they die in any publicke\r\nsports, holding them venemous; because, being drunke, they drive a man\r\nto be as mad as a beare; and the like is reported of the heart of a\r\nLyon, and the braine of a Cat. The right eie of a beare dried to pouder,\r\nand hung about children’s neckes in a little bag, driveth away the\r\nterrour of dreames, and both the eyes whole, bound to a man’s left arme,\r\neaseth a quartan ague.\r\n\r\n“The liver of a sow, a lamb, and a bear put togither, and trod to pouder\r\nunder one’s shoos, easeth and defendeth cripples from inflamation: the\r\ngall being preserved and warmed in water, delivereth the bodie from\r\nColde, when all other medicine faileth. Some give it, mixt with Water,\r\nto them that are bitten with a mad Dogge, holding it for a singular\r\nremedie, if the party can fast three daies before. It is also given\r\nagainst the palsie, the king’s evill, the falling sickenesse, an old\r\ncough, the inflamation of the eies, the running of the eares, delevery\r\nin child birth, the Hæmorrhods, the weaknes of the backe, and the\r\npalsie: and that women may go their full time, they make ammulets of\r\nBear’s nails, and cause them to weare them all the time they are with\r\nChild.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Englishmen, the Fox has been raised to the height of at least a\r\ndemigod--and his cult is a serious matter attended with great minutiæ of\r\nritual. Englishmen and Foxes cannot live together, but they live for one\r\nanother, the man to hunt the fox, the fox to be hunted. If there be a\r\nfox anywhere, even in the Campagna at Rome, and there are sufficient\r\nEnglishmen to get up a scratch pack of hounds, there must “bold Reynard”\r\nbe tortured with fear and exertion, only, in all probability, to die a\r\ncruel death in the end. In the Peninsular War, a pack of foxhounds\r\naccompanied the army; in India, failing foxes, they take the nearest\r\nsubstitute, the jackal; and in Australia, _faute de mieux_, they hunt\r\nthe Dingo, or native dog. No properly constituted Englishman could ever\r\ncompass the death of a poor fox, otherwise than by hunting. The\r\nVulpecide--in any other manner--is, in an English county, a social\r\nleper--he is a thing _anathema_. Running away with a neighbour’s wife\r\nmay be condoned by county society, at least, among the men, but with\r\nthem the man that shoots foxes is a very pariah, and it were good for\r\nthat man had he never been born.\r\n\r\nEvery other nation, even from historic antiquity, has reckoned the Fox\r\nas among the ordinary _feræ naturæ_, to be killed, when met with, for\r\nthe sake only of his skin, for his flesh is not toothsome: and when he\r\narrives at the dignity of a silver or a black fox, his fur enwraps royal\r\npersonages, as being of extreme value.\r\n\r\nThe Fox is noted everywhere for its “_craftiness_,” and was so famed\r\nlong before the epic of Reineke Fuchs was evolved, and, indeed, this may\r\nbe said to be its principal attribute. Many are the stories told by\r\ncountry firesides of his stratagems, both in plundering and in his\r\nendeavours to escape from his enemies. Indeed, no country ought to be\r\nable to compare in Fox lore with our own. Its sagacity, cunning, or call\r\nit what you like, dates far back. Pliny tells us that “in Thrace, when\r\nall parts are covered with ice, the foxes are consulted, an animal,\r\nwhich, in other respects, is baneful from its Craftiness. It has been\r\nobserved, that this animal applies its ear to the ice, for the purpose\r\nof testing its thickness; hence it is, that the inhabitants will never\r\ncross frozen rivers and lakes, until the foxes have passed over them and\r\nreturned.”\r\n\r\nThe Fox is most abundant in the northern parts of Europe, and therefore\r\nwe hear more about him from the pages of Olaus Magnus, Gessner, and\r\nTopsell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe former says:--“When the fox is pressed with hunger, Cold and Snow,\r\nand he comes near men’s houses, he will bark like a dog, that house\r\ncreatures may come nearer to him with more confidence. Also, he will\r\nfaign himself dead, and lie on his back, drawing in his breath, and\r\nlolling out his tongue. The birds coming down, unawares, to feed on the\r\ncarkasse, are snapt up by him, with open mouth. Moreover, when he is\r\nhungry, and finds nothing to eat, he rolls himself in red earth, that he\r\nmay appear bloody; and, casting himself on the earth, he holds his\r\nbreath, and when the birds see that he breaths not, and that his tongue\r\nhangs forth of his mouth, they think he is dead; but so soon as they\r\ndescend, he draws them to him and devours them.\r\n\r\n“Again, when he sees that he cannot conquer the Urchin, for his\r\nprickles, he lays him on his back, and so rends the soft part of his\r\nbody. Sometimes fearing the multitude of wasps, he counterfeits and\r\nhides himself, his tail hanging out: and when he sees that they are all\r\nbusie, and entangled in his thick tail, he comes forth, and rubs them\r\nagainst a stone or Tree, and kills them and eats them. The same trick,\r\nalmost, he useth, when he lyes in wait for crabs and small fish, running\r\nabout the bank, and he lets down his tail into the water, they admire at\r\nit, and run to it, and are taken in his fur, and pull’d out. Moreover,\r\nwhen he hath fleas, he makes a little bundle of soft hay wrapt in hair,\r\nand holds it in his mouth; then he goes by degrees into the water,\r\nbeginning with his tail, that the fleas fearing the water, will run up\r\nall his body till they come at his head: then he dips in his head, that\r\nthey may leap into the hay; when this is done, he leaves the hay in the\r\nwater, and swims forth.\r\n\r\n“But when he is hungry, he will counterfeit to play with the Hare, which\r\nhe presently catcheth and devoureth, unlesse the Hare escape by flight,\r\nas he often doth. Sometimes he also escapes from the dogs by barking,\r\nfaigning himself to be a dog, but more surely when he hangs by a bough,\r\nand makes the dogs hunt in vain to find his footing. He is also wont to\r\ndeceive the Hunter and his dogs, when he runs among a herd of Goats, and\r\ngoes for one of them, leaping upon the Goat’s back, that he may sooner\r\nescape by the running of the Goat, by reason of the hatefull Rider on\r\nhis back. The other Goats follow, which the Hunter fearing to molest,\r\ncalls off his Dogs that many be not killed.\r\n\r\n“If he be taken in a string, he will sometime bite off his own foot, and\r\nso get away. But, if there be no way open he will faign himself dead,\r\nthat being taken out of the snare, he may run away. Moreover, when a dog\r\nruns after him, and overtakes him, and would bite him, he draws his\r\nbristly tail through the dog’s mouth, and so he deludes the dog till he\r\ncan get into the lurking places of the Woods. I saw also in the Rocks of\r\n_Norway_ a Fox with a huge tail, who brought many Crabs out of the\r\nwater, and then he ate them. And that is no rare sight, when as no fish\r\nlike Crabs will stick to a bristly thing let down into the water, and to\r\ndry fish, laid on the rocks to dry. They that are troubled with the\r\nGowt, are cured by laying the warm skin of this beast about the part,\r\nand binding it on. The fat, also, of the same creature, laid smeered\r\nupon the ears or lims of a gowty person, heals him; his fat is good for\r\nall torments of the guts, and for all pains, his brain often given to a\r\nchild will preserve it ever from the Falling-sicknesse. These and\r\nsuch-like simple medicaments the North Country people observe.”\r\n\r\nA portion of the above receives a curious corroboration from Mr. P.\r\nRobinson in his book, _The Poets’ Beasts_. Speaking of the Lynx, he\r\nsays:--“But it is not, as is supposed, ‘untamable.’ The Gækwar of Baroda\r\nhas a regular pack of trained lynxes, for stalking and hunting pea-fowl,\r\nand other kinds of birds. I have, myself, seen a tame lynx that had been\r\ntaught to catch crows--no simple feat--and its strategy was as diverting\r\nas its agility amazing. It would lie down with the end of a string in\r\nits mouth, the other end being fast to a stake, and pretend to be\r\nasleep, dead asleep, drunk, chloroformed, anything you like that means\r\nprofound and gross slumber. A foot or so off would be lying a piece of\r\nmeat, or a bone.\r\n\r\n“The crows would very soon discover the bone, and collecting round in a\r\ncircle, would discuss the probabilities of the lynx only shamming, and\r\nthe chances of stealing his dinner. The animal would take no notice\r\nwhatever, but lie there looking so limp and dead, that at last one crow\r\nwould make so bold as to come forward. The others let it do so alone,\r\nknowing that afterwards there would be a free fight for the plunder, and\r\nthe thief, probably, not enjoy it, after all. So the delegate would\r\nadvance with all the caution of a crow--and nothing exceeds it--until\r\nwithin seizing distance. There it would stop, flirt its wings nervously,\r\nstoop, take a last long look at the lynx to make sure that it really\r\n_was_ asleep, and then dart like lightning at the bone. But, if the crow\r\nwas as quick as lightning, the lynx was as swift as thought, and lo! the\r\nnext instant there was the beast sitting up with the bird in its\r\nmouth!...\r\n\r\n“Next time it had to practise a completely different manœuvre. The same\r\ncrows are not to be ‘humbugged’ a second time by a repetition of the\r\nbeing-dead trick. So the lynx, when a sufficient number of the birds had\r\nassembled, would take the string in its mouth, and run round and round\r\nthe stake, at the extreme limit of its tether, as if it were tied. The\r\ncrows, after their impudent fashion, would close in. They thought they\r\nknew the exact circumference of the animal’s circle, and getting as\r\nclose to the dangerous line as possible, without actually transgressing\r\nit, would mock and abuse the supposed betethered brute. But all of a\r\nsudden, the circling lynx would fly out at a tangent, right into the\r\nthick of his black tormentors, and, as a rule, bag a brace, right and\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\nTopsell gives some curious particulars of the Fox, and, speaking of\r\ntheir earths, he says:--“These dens have many caves in them, and\r\npassages in and out, that when the Terrars shall set upon him in the\r\nearth, he may go forth some other way, and forasmuch as the Wolfe is an\r\nenemy to the Foxe, he layeth in the mouth of his den, an Herbe (called\r\nSea-onyon) which is so contrary to the nature of a Wolfe, and he so\r\ngreatly terrified therewith, that hee will never come neere the place\r\nwhere it groweth, or lyeth; the same is affirmed of the Turtle to save\r\nher young ones, but I have not read that Wolves will prey upon Turtles,\r\nand therefore we reject that as a fable.... If a Foxe eat any meat\r\nwherein are bitter Almondes, they die thereof, if they drinke not\r\npresently: and the same thing do Aloes in their meate worke uppon them,\r\nas _Scaliger_ affirmeth upon his owne sighte or knowledge. _Apocynon_ or\r\nBear-foot given to dogs, wolves, Foxes, and all other beasts which are\r\nlittered blind, in fat, or any other meat, killeth them, if vomit helpe\r\nthem not, which falleth out very seldome, and the seeds of this hearbe\r\nhave the same operation. It is reported by _Democritus_, that, if wilde\r\nrue be secretly hunge under a Hen’s wing, no Fox will meddle with her,\r\nand the same writer also declareth for approoved, that, if you mingle\r\nthe gal of a Fox, or a Cat, with their ordinary foode, they shall\r\nremaine free from the danger of these beasts.\r\n\r\n“The medicinall uses of this beast are these: first, (as _Pliny_, and\r\n_Marcellus_ affirme) a Fox sod in water until nothing of the Foxe be\r\nleft whole except the bones, and the Legges, or other parts of a gouty\r\nbody, washed, and daily bathed therein, it shall drive away all paine\r\nand griefe strengthening the defective and weake members; so also it\r\ncureth all the shrinking up and paines in the sinnewes: and _Galen_\r\nattributeth the same vertue to an _Hyæna_ sod in Oyle, and the lame\r\nperson bathed therein, for it hath such power to evacuate and draw forth\r\nwhatsoever evill humour aboundeth in the body of man, that it leaveth\r\nnothing hurtfull behinde.\r\n\r\n“Neverthelesse, such bodies are soon againe replenished through evill\r\ndyet, and relapsed into the same disease againe. The Fox may be boyled\r\nin fresh or salt water with annise and time, and with his skin on whole,\r\nand not slit, or else his head cut off, there being added to the\r\ndecoction two pintes of oyle.\r\n\r\n“The flesh of a Foxe sod and layed to afore bitten by a Sea hare, it\r\ncureth and healeth the same. The Foxe’s skinne is profitable against all\r\nmoyste fluxes in the skinne of the body, and also the gowt, and cold in\r\nthe sinnewes. The ashes of Foxe’s flesh burnt and drunk in wine, is\r\nprofitable against the shortnesse of breath and stoppings of the liver.\r\n\r\n“The blood of a Foxe dissected, and taken forth of his urine alive, and\r\nso drunk, breaketh the stone in the bladder, or else (as _Myrepsus_\r\nsaieth) kill the Foxe, and take the blood, and drink a Cupfull thereof,\r\nand afterward with the same wash the parts, and, within an houre the\r\nstone shall be voyded: the same vertue is in it being dryed and drunke\r\nin wine with sugar.\r\n\r\n“_Oxycraton_ and Foxes blood infused into the Nostrils of a lethargick\r\nHorsse, cureth him. The fat is next to a Bul’s and a Swine’s, so that\r\nthe fat or larde of Swine may be used for the fat of Foxes, and the fat\r\nof Foxes for the Swines grease in medicine. Some do herewith annoynte\r\nthe places which have the Crampe, and all trembling and shaking\r\nmembers. The fatte of a Foxe and a Drake enclosed in the belly of a\r\nGoose, and so rosted, with the dripping that commeth from it, they\r\nannoynt paralyticke members.\r\n\r\n“The same, with powder of Vine twigs mollified and sod in lye,\r\nattenuateth, and bringeth downe, all swelling tumours of the flesh. The\r\nfat alone healeth the _Alopecias_ and looseness of the haire; it is\r\ncommended in the cure of all sores and ulcers of the head, but the gall,\r\nand time, with Mustard-seede is more approved. The fat is also respected\r\nfor the cure of paine in the eares, if it be warmed and melt at the\r\nfire, and so instilled; and this is used against tingling in the eares.\r\nIf the Haires rot away on a Horse’s taile, they recover them againe, by\r\nwashing the place with urine and branne, with Wyne and Oyle, and\r\nafterward annoynt it with foxe’s grease. When sores or ulcers have\r\nprocured the haire to fall off from the heade, take the head of a young\r\nfoxe burned with the leaves of blacke _Orchanes_ and _Alcyonium_, and\r\nthe powder cast upon the head recovereth againe the haire.\r\n\r\n“If the braine be often given to infants and sucking children, it maketh\r\nthem that they shall remaine free from the falling evill. _Pliny_\r\nprescribeth a man which twinkleth with his eies, and cannot looke\r\nstedfastly, to weare in a chaine, the tongue of a foxe; and _Marcellus_\r\nbiddeth to cut out the tongue of a live foxe, and to turne him away, and\r\nhang uppe that tongue to dry in purple thred, and, afterward put it\r\nabout his necke that is troubled with the whitenesse of the eies, and it\r\nshall cure him.\r\n\r\n“But it is more certainely affirmed, that the tongue, either dryed, or\r\ngreene, layed to the flesh wherein is any Dart or other sharpe head, it\r\ndraweth them forth violently, and rendeth not the flesh, but, only where\r\nit is entred. The liver dryed, and drunke cureth often sighing. The\r\nsame, or the lights drunke in blacke Wine, openeth the passages of\r\nbreathing. The same washed in Wyne, and dryed in an earthen pot in an\r\nOven, and, afterward, seasoned with Sugar, is the best medicine in the\r\nworld for an old cough, for it hath bin approved to cure it, although it\r\nhath continued twenty years, drinking every day two sponfuls in Wine.\r\n\r\n“The lightes of foxes drunke in Water after they have beene dryed into\r\npowder, helpeth the Melt, and _Myrepsus_ affirmeth, that when he gave\r\nthe same powder to one almost suffocated in a pleurisie it prevailed for\r\na remedy. _Archigene_ prescribeth the dried liver of a Fox for the\r\nSpleneticke with Oxymell: and _Marcellinus_ for the Melt, drunke after\r\nthe same manner; and _Sextus_ adviseth to drinke it simply without\r\ncomposition of Oxymell. The gall of a Foxe instilled into the eares with\r\nOyle, cureth the paine in them, and, mixed with Hony Atticke, and\r\nannointed upon the eies, taketh away al dimnes from them, after an\r\nadmirable manner. The melt, bound upon the tumors, and bunches of the\r\nbrest, cureth the Melt in man’s body. The reynes dried and mingled with\r\nHonie, being anointed uppon Kernels, take them away. For the swelling of\r\nthe Chaps, rub the reines of a Fox within the mouth. The dung, pounded\r\nwith Vineger, by annointment cureth the Leprosie speedily. These and\r\nsuch other vertues medicinal, both the elder and later Phisitians have\r\nobserved in a Fox,--wherewithal we wil conclude this discourse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf, as a beast of prey, is invested with a terror peculiarly its\r\nown; when solitary, it is not much dreaded by, and generally shrinks\r\nfrom, man, but, united by hunger into packs, they are truly to be\r\ndreaded, for they spare not man nor beast. They lie, too, under the\r\nimputation of magic, and have done so from a very early age. Their\r\ncunning, instinct, or reasoning powers, are almost as well developed as\r\nin the fox, and, of all the authorities I have consulted, the one best\r\nfitted to discourse upon the Wolf and his peculiarities is Topsell, and\r\nhere is one of their idiosyncrasies:--\r\n\r\n“It is said that Wolves doe also eate a kind of earth called _Argilla_,\r\nwhich they doe not for hunger, but to make their bellies waigh heavy, to\r\nthe intent, that when they set upon a Horsse, an Oxe, a Hart, an Elke,\r\nor some such strong beast, they may waigh the heavier, and hang fast at\r\ntheir throates till they have pulled them downe, for by vertue of that\r\ntenacious earth, their teeth are sharpened, and the waight of their\r\nbodies encreased; but, when they have killed the beast that they set\r\nupon, before they touch any part of his flesh, by a kind of natural\r\nvomit, they disgorge themselves, and empty their bellies of the earth,\r\nas unprofitable food....\r\n\r\n“They also devoure Goates and Swyne of all sortes, except Bores, who doe\r\nnot easily yeald unto Wolves. It is said that a Sow, hath resisted a\r\nWolfe, and when he fighteth with her, hee is forced to use his greatest\r\ncraft and suttelty, leaping to and from her with his best activity,\r\nleast she should lay her teeth upon him, and so at one time deceive him\r\nof his prey, and deprive him of his life. It is reported of one that saw\r\na Wolfe in a Wood, take in his mouth a peece of Timber of some thirty or\r\nforty pound waight, and with that he did practise to leape over the\r\ntrunke of a tree that lay upon the earth; at length, when he perceived\r\nhis own ability and dexterity in leaping with that waight in his mouth,\r\nhe did there make his cave, and lodged behinde that tree; at last, it\r\nfortuned there came a wild Sow to seeke for meat along by that tree,\r\nwith divers of her pigs following her, of different age, some a yeare\r\nolde, some halfe a yeare, and some lesse. When he saw them neare him, he\r\nsuddenly set upon one of them, which he conjectured was about the waite\r\nof Wood which he carried in his mouth, and when he had taken him,\r\nwhilest the old Sow came to deliver her pig at his first crying, he\r\nsuddenly leaped over the tree with the pig in his mouth, and so was the\r\npoore Sow beguiled of her young one, for she could not leape after him,\r\nand yet might stand and see the Wolfe to eate the pigge, which hee had\r\ntaken from her. It is also sayd, that when they will deceive Goates,\r\nthey come unto them with the greene leaves and small boughes of Osiers\r\nin their mouthes, wherewithall they know Goats are delighted, that so\r\nthey may draw them therewith, as to a baite, to devour them.\r\n\r\n“Their maner is, when they fal upon a Goat or a Hog, or some such other\r\nbeast of smal stature, not to kil them, but to lead them by the eare\r\nwith al the speed they can drive them, to their fellow Wolves, and, if\r\nthe beast be stubborne, and wil not runne with him, then he beateth his\r\nhinder parts with his taile, in the mean time holding his ear fast in\r\nhis mouth, whereby he causeth the poore beast to run as fast, or faster\r\nthan himselfe unto the place of his owne execution, where he findeth a\r\ncrew of ravening Wolves to entertaine him, who, at his first appearance\r\nseize upon him, and, like Divels teare him in peeces in a moment,\r\nleaving nothing uneaten but onely his bowels....\r\n\r\n“Now although there be a great difference betwixt him and a Bul, both in\r\nstrength and stature, yet he is not affraid to adventure combat,\r\ntrusting in his policy more than his vigor, for when he setteth upon a\r\nBul, he commeth not upon the front for feare of his hornes, nor yet\r\nbehind him for feare of his heeles, but first of al standeth a loofe\r\nfrom him, with his glaring eyes, daring and provoking the Bul, making\r\noften profers to come neere unto him, yet is wise enough to keepe a\r\nloofe till he spy his advauntage, and then he leapeth suddenly upon the\r\nbacke of the Bul at the one side, and being so ascended, taketh such\r\nhold, that he killeth the beast, before he loosen his teeth. It is also\r\nworth the observation, how he draweth unto him a Calfe that wandereth\r\nfrom the dam, for by singular treacherie he taketh him by the nose,\r\nfirst drawing him forwarde, and then the poore beast striveth and\r\ndraweth backward, and thus they struggle togither, one pulling one way,\r\nand the other another, till at last the Wolfe perceiving advantage, and\r\nfeeling when the Calfe pulleth heavyest, suddenly he letteth go his\r\nhold, whereby the poore beast falleth backe upon his buttocks, and so\r\ndowne right upon his backe; then flyeth the Wolfe to his belly which is\r\nthen his upper part, and easily teareth out his bowels, so satisfieng\r\nhis hunger and greedy appetite.\r\n\r\n“But, if they chance to see a Beast in the water, or in the marsh,\r\nencombred with mire, they come round about him, stopping up al the\r\npassages where he shold come out, baying at him, and threatning him, so\r\nas the poore distressed Oxe plungeth himselfe many times over head and\r\neares, or at the least wise they so vex him in the mire, that they never\r\nsuffer him to come out alive. At last, when they perceive him to be\r\ndead, and cleane without life by suffocation, it is notable to observe\r\ntheir singular subtilty to drawe him out of the mire, whereby they may\r\neat him; for one of them goeth in, and taketh the beast by the taile,\r\nwho draweth with al the power he can, for wit without strength may\r\nbetter kill a live Beast, than remove a dead one out of the mire;\r\ntherefore, he looketh behind him, and calleth for more helpe; then,\r\npresently another of the wolves taketh that first wolve’s tail in his\r\nmouth, and a third wolf the second’s, a fourth the third’s, a fift the\r\nfourth, and so forward, encreasing theyr strength, until they have\r\npulled the beast out into the dry lande. _Sextus_ saith that, in case a\r\nWolf do see a man first, if he have about him the tip of a Wolf’s taile,\r\nhe shal not neede to feare anie harme. All domestical Foure footed\r\nbeasts, which see the eie of a wolfe in the hand of a man, will\r\npresently feare and runne away.\r\n\r\n“If the taile of a wolfe be hung in the cratch of Oxen, they can never\r\neat their meate. If a horse tread upon the foote steps of a Wolfe, which\r\nis under a Horse-man or Rider, hee breaketh in peeces, or else standeth\r\namazed. If a wolfe treadeth in the footsteps of a horse which draweth a\r\nwaggon, he cleaveth fast in the rode, as if he were frozen.\r\n\r\n“If a Mare with foale, tread upon the footsteps of a wolfe, she casteth\r\nher foal, and therefore the Egyptians, when they signifie abortment doe\r\npicture a mare treading upon a wolf’s foot. These and such other things\r\nare reported, (but I cannot tell how true) as supernaturall accidents in\r\nwolves. The wolfe also laboureth to overcome the Leoparde, and followeth\r\nhim from place to place, but, for as much as they dare not adventure\r\nupon him single, or hand to hand, they gather multitudes, and so\r\ndevoure them. When wolves set upon wilde Bores, although they bee at\r\nvariance amonge themselves, yet they give over their mutual combats, and\r\njoyne together against the Wolfe their common adversarie.\r\n\r\n“And this is the nature of this beast, that he feareth no kind of weapon\r\nexcept a stone, for, if a stone be cast at him, he presently falleth\r\ndowne to avoide the stroke, for it is saide that in that place of his\r\nbody where he is wounded by a stone, there are bred certaine wormes\r\nwhich doe kill and destroie him.... As the Lyon is afraide of a white\r\nCocke and a Mouse, so is the wolfe of a Sea crab, or shrimp. It is said\r\nthat the pipe of _Pithocaris_ did represse the violence of wolves when\r\nthey set upon him, for he sounded the same unperfectly, and\r\nindistinctly, at the noise whereof the raging wolfe ran away; and it\r\nhath bin beleeved that the voice of a singing man or woman worketh the\r\nsame effect.\r\n\r\n“Concerning the enimies of wolves, there is no doubt but that such a\r\nravening beast hath fewe friends, ... for this cause, in some of the\r\ninferiour beasts their hatred lasteth after death, as many Authors have\r\nobserved; for, if a sheepe skinne be hanged up with a wolves’s skin, the\r\nwool falleth off from it, and, if an instrument be stringed with\r\nstringes made of both these beasts the one will give no sounde in the\r\npresence of the other.”\r\n\r\nHere we have had all the bad qualities of the Wolf depicted in glowing\r\ncolours; but, as a faithful historian, I must show him also under his\r\nmost favourable aspect--notably in two instances--one the she-wolf that\r\nsuckled Romulus and Remus, and the other who watched so tenderly over\r\nthe head of the Saxon Edmund, King and Martyr, after it had been severed\r\nfrom his body by the Danes, and contemptuously thrown by them into a\r\nthicket. His mourning followers found the body, but searched for some\r\ntime for the head, without success; although they made the woods resound\r\nwith their cries of “Where artow, Edward?” After a few days’ search, a\r\nvoice answered their inquiries, with “Here, here, here.” And, guided by\r\nthe supernatural voice, they came upon the King’s head, surrounded by a\r\nglory, and watched over, so as to protect it from all harm--by a _WOLF_!\r\nThe head was applied deftly to the body, which it joined naturally;\r\nindeed, so good a job was it, that the junction could only be perceived\r\nby a thin red, or purple, line.\r\n\r\nIt must be said of this wolf, that he was _thorough_, for not content\r\nwith having preserved the head of the Saintly King from harm, he meekly\r\nfollowed the body to St. Edmund’s Bury, and waited there until the\r\nfuneral; when he quietly trotted back, none hindering him, to the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWERE-WOLVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut of all extraordinary stories connected with the Wolf, is the belief\r\nwhich existed for many centuries, (and in some parts of France still\r\ndoes exist, under the form of the “Loup-garou,”) and which is mentioned\r\nby many classical authors--Marcellus Sidetes, Virgil, Herodotus,\r\nPomponius Mela, Ovid, Pliny, Petronius, &c.--of men being able to change\r\nthemselves into wolves. This was called _Lycanthropy_, from two Greek\r\nwords signifying wolf, and man, and those who were thus gifted, were\r\ndignified by the name of _Versipellis_, or able to change the skin. It\r\nmust be said, however, for Pliny, amongst classical authors, that\r\nalthough he panders sufficiently to popular superstition to mention\r\nLycanthropy, and quotes from others some instances of it, yet he\r\nwrites:--“It is really wonderful to what a length the credulity of the\r\nGreeks will go! There is no falsehood, if ever so barefaced, to which\r\nsome of them cannot be found to bear testimony.”\r\n\r\nThis curious belief is to be found in Eastern writings, and it was\r\nespecially at home with the Scandinavian and Teutonic nations. It is\r\nfrequently mentioned in the Northern Sagas--but space here forbids more\r\nthan just saying that the best account of these _eigi einhamir_ (not of\r\none skin) is to be found in _The Book of Were-Wolves_, by the Rev. S.\r\nBaring-Gould.\r\n\r\nThe name of _Were Wolf_, or _Wehr Wolf_, is derived thus, according to\r\nMr. Gould:--“_Vargr_ is the same as _u-argr_, restless; _argr_ being the\r\nsame as the Anglo-Saxon _earg_. _Vargr_ had its double signification in\r\nNorse. It signified a Wolf, and also a godless man. This _vargr_ is the\r\nEnglish _were_, in the word were-wolf, and the _garou_ or _varou_ in\r\nFrench. The Danish word for were-wolf is _var-ulf_ the Gothic,\r\n_vaira-ulf_.” Lycanthropy was a widespread belief, but it gradually\r\ndwindled down in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to those _eigi\r\neinhamir_, the witches who would change themselves into hares, &c.\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus tells us _Of the Fiercenesse of Men who by Charms are\r\nturned into Wolves_:--“In the Feast of Christ’s Nativity, in the night,\r\nat a certain place, that they are resolved upon amongst themselves,\r\nthere is gathered together such a huge multitude of Wolves changed from\r\nmen, that dwell in divers places, which afterwards the same night doth\r\nso rage with wonderfull fiercenesse, both against mankind, and other\r\ncreatures that are not fierce by nature, that the Inhabitants of that\r\ncountry suffer more hurt from them than ever they do from the true\r\nnatural Wolves. For as it is proved, they set upon the houses of men\r\nthat are in the Woods, with wonderfull fiercenesse, and labour to break\r\ndown the doors, whereby they may destroy both men and other creatures\r\nthat remain there.\r\n\r\n“They go into the Beer-Cellars, and there they drink out some Tuns of\r\nBeer or Mede, and they heap al the empty vessels one upon another in the\r\nmidst of the Cellar, and so leave them: wherein they differ from natural\r\nand true Wolves. But the place, where, by chance they stayd that night,\r\nthe Inhabitants of those Countries think to be prophetical: Because, if\r\nany ill successe befall a Man in that place; as, if his Cart overturn,\r\nand he be thrown down in the Snow, they are fully perswaded that man\r\nmust die that year, as they have for many years proved it by experience.\r\nBetween _Lituania_, _Samogetia_, and _Curonia_, there is a certain wall\r\nleft, of a Castle that was thrown down; to this, at a set time, some\r\nthousands of them come together, that each of them may try his\r\nnimblenesse in leaping. He that cannot leap over this wall, as commonly\r\nthe fat ones cannot, are beaten with whips by their Captains.\r\n\r\n“And it is constantly affirmed that amongst that multitude there are the\r\ngreat men, and chiefest Nobility of the Land. The reason of this\r\nmetamorphosis, that is exceeding contrary to Nature, is given by one\r\nskilled in this witchcraft, by drinking to one in a Cup of Ale, and by\r\nmumbling certain words at the same time, so that he who is to be\r\nadmitted into that unlawful Society, do accept it. Then, when he\r\npleaseth, he may change his humane form, into the form of a Wolf\r\nentirely, going into some private Cellar, or secret Wood. Again, he can,\r\nafter some time put off the same shape he took upon him, and resume the\r\nform he had before at his pleasure....\r\n\r\n“But for to come to examples; When a certain Nobleman took a long\r\njourney through the Woods, and had many servile Country-fellows in his\r\nCompany, that were acquainted with this witchcraft, (as there are many\r\nsuch found in those parts) the day was almost spent; wherefore he must\r\nlie in the Woods, for there was no Inne neare that place; and withall\r\nthey were sore pinched with hunger and want. Last of all, one of the\r\nCompany propounded a seasonable proposall, that the rest must be quiet,\r\nand if they saw any thing they must make no tumulte; that he saw afar\r\noff a flock of sheep feeding; he would take care that, without much\r\nlabor, they should have one of them to rost for Supper. Presently he\r\ngoes into a thick Wood that no man might see him, and there he changed\r\nhis humane shape like to that of a Wolf. After this he fell upon the\r\nflock of sheep with all his might, and he took one of them that was\r\nrunning back to the Wood, and then he came to the Chariot in the form of\r\na Wolf, and brought the sheep to them. His companions being conscious\r\nhow he stole it, receive it with grateful mind, and hide it close in the\r\nChariot; but he that had changed himself into a Wolf, went into the Wood\r\nagain, and became a Man.\r\n\r\n“Also in _Livonia_ not many years since, it fell out that there was a\r\ndispute between a Nobleman’s wife and his servant, (of which they have\r\nplenty more in that Country, than in any Christian Land) that men could\r\nnot be turned into Wolves; whereupon he brake forth into this speech,\r\nthat he would presently shew her an example of that businesse, so he\r\nmight do it with her permission: he goes alone into the cellar, and,\r\npresently after, he came forth in the form of a Wolf. The dogs ran\r\nafter him through the fields to the wood, and they bit out one of his\r\neyes, though he defended himself stoutly enough. The next day he came\r\nwith one eye to his Lady. Lastly, as is yet fresh in memory, how the\r\nDuke of _Prussia_, giving small credit to such a Witchcraft, compelled\r\none who was cunning in this Sorcery, whom he held in chains, to change\r\nhimself into a Wolf; and he did so. Yet that he might not go unpunished\r\nfor this Idolatry, he afterwards caused him to be burnt. For such\r\nheinous offences are severely punished both by Divine and Humane Laws.”\r\n\r\nZahn, on the authority of Trithemius, who wrote in 1335, says that men\r\nhaving the spine elongated after the manner of a tail were Were-wolves.\r\nTopsell takes a more sensible view of the matter:--“There is a certaine\r\nterritorie in Ireland (whereof M. _Cambden_ writeth) that the\r\ninhabitants which live till they be past fifty yeare old, are foolishly\r\nreported to be turned into wolves, the true cause whereof he\r\nconjectureth to be, because for the most part they are vexed with the\r\ndisease called _Lycanthropia_, which is a kind of melancholy, causing\r\nthe persons so affected, about the moneth of February, to forsake their\r\nowne dwelling or houses, and to run out into the woodes, or neare the\r\ngraves and sepulchers of men, howling and barking like Dogs and Wolves.\r\nThe true signes of this disease are thus described by _Marcellus_:\r\nthose, saith he, which are thus affected, have their faces pale, their\r\neies dry and hollow, looking drousily and cannot weep. Their tongue as\r\nif it were al scab’d, being very rough, neither can they spit, and they\r\nare very thirsty, having many ulcers breaking out of their bodies,\r\nespecially on their legges; this disease some cal _Lycaon_, and men\r\noppressed therewith, _Lycaones_, because that there was one _Lycaon_, as\r\nit is fained by the poets, who, for his wickednes in sacrificing of a\r\nchild, was by _Jupiter_ turned into a Wolf, being utterly distracted of\r\nhuman understanding, and that which the poets speake of him. And this is\r\nmost strange, that many thus diseased should desire the graves of the\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTELOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen not taken from living specimens, or skins, the artists of old drew\r\nsomewhat upon their imaginations for their facts, as is the case with\r\nthis Antelope, of which Topsell gives the following description:--“They\r\nare bred in _India_, and _Syria_, neere the River _Euphrates_, and\r\ndelight much to drinke of the cold water thereof. Their bodie is like\r\nthe body of a _Roe_, and they have hornes growing forthe of the crowne\r\nof their head, which are very long and sharpe; so that _Alexander_\r\naffirmed that they pierced through the sheeldes of his Souldiers, and\r\nfought with them very irefully: at which time his company slew as he\r\ntravelled to _India_, eight thousand, five hundred, and fifty; which\r\ngreat slaughter may be the occasion why they are so rare, and seldome\r\nseene to this day, by cause thereby the breeders, and meanes of their\r\ncontinuance (which consisted in their multitude) were weakened and\r\ndestroyed. Their hornes are great, and made like a saw, and they, with\r\nthem, can cut asunder the braunches of _Osier_, or small trees, whereby\r\nit commeth to passe that many times their necks are taken in the twists\r\nof the falling boughes, whereat the Beast with repining cry, bewrayeth\r\nhimselfe to the Hunters, and so is taken. The vertues of this Beast are\r\nunknowne, and therefore _Suidas_ sayth an _Antalope_ is but good in\r\npart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAldrovandus gives us a curious specimen of a horse, which the artist has\r\ndrawn with the slashed trunk breeches of the time. He says that\r\n_Fincelius_, quoting _Licosthenes_, mentions that this animal had its\r\nskin thus slashed, from its birth, and was to be seen about the year\r\n1555. Its skin was as thick as sole-leather. It was, probably, an ideal\r\nZebra.\r\n\r\nTopsell gives us some fine horse-lore, especially as to their love for\r\ntheir masters:--“_Homer_ seemeth also to affirme that there are in\r\nHorsses divine qualityes, understanding things to come, for, being tyed\r\nto their mangers they mournd for the death of _Patroclus_, and also\r\nshewed _Achilles_ what should happen unto him; for which cause _Pliny_\r\nsaieth of them that they lament their lost maisters with teares, and\r\nforeknow battailes. _Accursius_ affirmeth that _Cæsar_ three daies\r\nbefore he died, found his ambling Nag weeping in the stable, which was a\r\ntoken of his ensewing death, which thing I should not beleeve, except\r\n_Tranquillus_ in the life of _Cæsar_, had related the same thing, and he\r\naddeth moreover, that the Horsses which were consecrated to _Mars_ for\r\npassing over _Rubicon_, being let to run wilde abroad, without their\r\nmaisters, because no man might meddle with the horses of the Gods, were\r\nfound to weepe abundantly, and to abstaine from all meat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Horsses are afraid of Elephants in battaile, and likewise of a\r\nCammell, for which cause when _Cyrus_ fought against _Crœsus_, he\r\noverthrew his Horse by the sight of Camels, for a horse cannot abide to\r\nlooke upon a Camell. If a Horse tread in the footpath of a Wolfe, he\r\npresently falleth to be astonished; Likewise, if two or more drawing a\r\nCharriot, come into the place where a Wolfe hath trod, they stand so\r\nstill as if the Charriot and they were frozen to the earth, sayth\r\n_Ælianus_ and _Pliny_. _Æsculapius_ also affirmeth the same thing of a\r\nHorsse treading in a Beare’s footsteppes, and assigneth the reason to be\r\nin some secret, betweene the feete of both beastes....\r\n\r\n“Al kind of Swine are enemies to Horses, the Estridge also, is so feared\r\nof a Horse, that the Horsse dares not appeare in his presence. The like\r\ndifference also is betwixt a Horse, and a Beare. There is a bird which\r\nis called _Anclorus_, which neyeth like a Horse, flying about; the Horse\r\ndoth many times drive it away; but because it is somewhat blind, and\r\ncannot see perfectly, therefore the horsse doth oftentimes ketch it, and\r\ndevoure it, hating his owne voice in a creature so unlike himself.\r\n\r\n“It is reported by _Aristotle_, that the Bustard loveth a Horsse\r\nexceedingly, for, seeing other Beastes feeding in the pastures,\r\ndispiseth and abhorreth them; but, as soone as ever it seeth a Horsse,\r\nit flyeth unto him for joy, although the Horsse run away from it: and,\r\ntherefore, the Egyptians, when they see a weake man driving away a\r\nstronger, they picture a Bustard flying to a Horsse....\r\n\r\n“_Julius Cæsar_ had a horsse which had cloven hooves like a man’s\r\nfingers, and because he was foaled at that time when the sooth-sayers\r\nhad pronounced that hee should have the government of the world,\r\ntherefore he nourished him carefully, and never permitted any man to\r\nbacke him but himselfe, which he afterwards dedicated in the Temple of\r\nVenus....\r\n\r\n“If one do cut the vaines of the pallet of a horse’s mouth, and let it\r\nrunne downe into his belly, it will presently destroy and consume the\r\nmaw, or belly worms, which are within him. The Marrow of a horse is also\r\nvery good to loosen the sinewes which are knit and fastned together, but\r\nfirst let it be boiled in wine, and afterwards be made cold, and then\r\nanointed warmly either by the Fire, or Sun. The teeth of a male horse\r\nnot gelded, or by any labor made feeble, being put under the head, or\r\nover the head of him that is troubled or startleth in his dreame, doth\r\nwithstand and resist all unquietnes which in the time of his rest might\r\nhappen unto him. The teeth also of a horse is verye profitable for the\r\ncuring of the Chilblanes which are rotten and full of corruption when\r\nthey are swollen full ripe. The teeth which do, first of all, fall from\r\nhorses, being bound or fastned upon children in their infancie, do very\r\neasily procure the breeding of the teeth, but with more speed, and more\r\neffectually, if they have never touched the ground....\r\n\r\n“If you anoint a combe with the foame of a horse, wherewith a young man\r\nor youth doth use to comb his head, it is of such force as it will cause\r\nthe haire of his head neither to encrease or any whit to appeare. The\r\nfoame of a horse is also very much commended for them which have either\r\npain or difficulty of hearing in their ears, or else the dust of horse\r\ndung, being new made and dryed, and mingled with oyle of Roses. The\r\ngriefe or soreness of a man’s mouth or throat, being washed or annointed\r\nwith the foame of a Horse, which hath bin fed with Oates or barly, doth\r\npresently expell the paine of the Sorenesse, if so be that it be 2 or 3\r\ntimes washed over with the juyce of young or greene Sea-crabs beaten\r\nsmall together.” But I could fill pages with remedial recipes furnished\r\nby the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIMICK DOG.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The Mimicke or Getulian Dogge,” is, I take it, meant for a poodle. It\r\nwas “apt to imitate al things it seeth, for which cause some have\r\nthought that it was conceived by an Ape, for in wit and disposition it\r\nresembleth an Ape, but in face, sharpe and blacke like an Hedgehog,\r\nhaving a short recurved body, very long legs, shaggy haire, and a short\r\ntaile: this is called of some _Canis Lucernarius_. These being brought\r\nup with apes in their youth, learne very admirable and strange feats,\r\nwhereof there were great plenty in _Egypt_ in the time of king\r\n_Ptolemy_, which were taught to leap, play, and dance, at the hearing of\r\nmusicke, and in many poore men’s houses they served insteed of servaunts\r\nfor divers uses.\r\n\r\n“These are also used by Plaiers and Puppet-Mimicks to worke straunge\r\ntrickes, for the sight whereof they get much money; such an one was the\r\nMimick’s dog, of which _Plutarch_ writeth that he saw in a publicke\r\nspectacle at Rome before the Emperor _Vespasian_. The dog was taught to\r\nact a play, wherein were contained many persons’ parts, I mean the\r\naffections of many other dogs; at last, there was given him a piece of\r\nbread, wherein, as was saide, was poison, having vertue to procure a\r\ndead sleepe, which he received and swallowed; and presently, after the\r\neating thereof, he began to reele and stagger too and fro like a drunken\r\nman, and fell downe to the ground, as if he had bin dead, and so laie a\r\ngood space, not stirring foot nor lim, being drawne uppe and downe by\r\ndivers persons, according as the gesture of the play he acted did\r\nrequire, but when he perceived by the time, and other signes that it was\r\nrequisite to arise, he first opened his eies, and lift up his head a\r\nlittle, then stretched forth himself, like as one doth when he riseth\r\nfrom sleepe; at last he geteth up, and runneth to him to whom that part\r\nbelonged, not without the joy, and good content of _Cæsar_ and all other\r\nbeholders.\r\n\r\n“To this may be added another story of a certaine Italian about the\r\nyeare 1403, called _Andrew_, who had a red Dog with him, of strange\r\nfeats, and yet he was blind. For standing in the Market place compassed\r\nabout with a circle of many people, there were brought by the standers\r\nby, many Rings, Jewels, bracelets, and peeces of gold and silver, and\r\nthese, within the circle were covered with earth, then the dog was bid\r\nto seeke them out, who with his nose and feet did presently find and\r\ndiscover them, then was hee also commaunded to give to every one his\r\nowne Ring, Jewell, Bracelet, or money, which the blind dog did performe\r\ndirectly without stay or doubt. Afterward, the standers by, gave unto\r\nhim divers pieces of coine, stamped with the images of sundry princes,\r\nand then one of them called for a piece of English money, and the Dog\r\ndelivered him a piece; another for the Emperor’s coine, and the dog\r\ndelivered him a piece thereof; and so consequently, every princes coine\r\nby name, till all was restored; and this story is recorded by Abbas\r\nUrspergensis, where upon the common people said, the dog was a divell,\r\nor else possessed with some pythonicall spirit.”\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note some of the remedies against hydrophobia--and I\r\nonly give a portion of the long list.\r\n\r\n“For the outward compound remedies, a plaister made of _Opponax_ and\r\nPitch, is much commended, which _Menippus_ used, taking a pound of Pitch\r\nof Brutias, and foure ounces of _Opponax_, adding withall, that the\r\n_Opponax_ must be dissolved in vinegar, and afterwards the Pitch and the\r\nvinegar must be boiled together, and when the vinegar is consumed, then\r\nput in the _Opponax_, and of both together make like taynters or\r\nsplints, and thrust them into the wound, so let them remaine many dayes\r\ntogether, and in the meane time drinke an antidot of sea crabs and\r\nvineger, (for vineger is alway pretious in this confection). Other use\r\n_Basilica_, Onyons, Rue, Salt, Rust of Iron, white bread, seedes of hore\r\nhound, and triacle: but the other plaister is most forcible to be\r\napplyed outwardly, above al medicines in the world.\r\n\r\n“For the simple or uncompounded medicines to be taken against this sore,\r\nare many: As Goose-grease, the roote of Wilde roses drunke; bitter\r\nAlmonds, leaves of Chickweed, or Pimpernell, the old skinne of a snake\r\npounded with a male sea Crab, Betony, Cabbage-leaves, or stalkes, with\r\nPersneps and vineger, lime and sewet, poulder of Sea-Crabs with Hony;\r\npoulder of the shels of Sea-Crabs, the haires of a Dog layed on the\r\nwound, the head of the Dog which did bite, mixed with a little\r\n_Euphorbium_; the haire of a man with vineger, dung of Goates with wine,\r\nWalnuts with Hony and salte, poulder of fig tree in a sear cloth,\r\nFitches in wine, _Euphorbium_, warme horse-dung, raw beanes chewed in\r\nthe mouth, fig tree leaves, greene figs with vineger, fennel stalkes,\r\nGentians, dung of pullen, the Lyver of a Buck-goate, young swallowes,\r\nburned to poulder, also their dung; the urine of a man, an Hyæna’s skin,\r\nflower de luce with honey, a Sea hearb called _Kakille_, _Silphum_ with\r\nsalt, the flesh and shels of snayles, leeke seeds with salt, mints, the\r\ntaile of a field mouse cut off from her alive, and she suffered to live,\r\nrootes of Burres, with salt of the Sea plantaine, the tongue of a Ramme\r\nwith salt, the flesh of al Sea-fishes, the fat of a sea-Calfe and\r\nVervine, besides many other superstitious amulets which are used to be\r\nbound to the Armes, neckes, and brests, as the Canine tooth bound up in\r\na leafe, and tyed to the Arme. A worme bred in the dung of Dogges,\r\nhanged about the necke, the roots of _Gentian_ in an Hyæna’s skin, or\r\nyoung Wolfe’s Skin, and such like; whereof I know no reason beside the\r\nopinion of men.”\r\n\r\nLet us now see what medicinal properties exist in dogs themselves; and,\r\nhere again, I must very much curtail the recital of their benefits to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n“The vertues of a Dog’s head made into poulder, are both many and\r\nunspeakable, by it is the biting of mad dogs cured, it cureth spots, and\r\nbunches in the head, and a plaister thereof made with Oyle of Roses,\r\nhealeth the running in the head. The poulder of the teeth of Dogges,\r\nmaketh Children’s teeth to come forth with speed and easie, and, if\r\ntheir gums be rub’d with a dog’s tooth, it maketh them to have the\r\nsharper teeth; and the poulder of these Dogs teeth rubbed upon the\r\nGummes of young or olde, easeth toothache, and abateth swelling in the\r\ngummes. The tongue of a Dogge, is most wholesome both for the curing of\r\nhis owne wounds by licking, as also of any other creature. The rennet of\r\na Puppy drunke with Wine, dissolveth the Collicke in the same houre\r\nwherein it was drunke,” &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAldrovandus gives us a picture of a curly-legged Cat, but, beyond saying\r\nthat it was so afflicted (or ornamented) from its birth, he gives no\r\nparticulars. Topsell, too, is singularly silent on the merits of Cats;\r\nbut yet he mentions some interesting particulars respecting them:--“To\r\nkeepe Cats from hunting of Hens, they use to tie a little wild rew under\r\ntheir wings, and so likewise from Dove-coates, if they set it in the\r\nwindowes, they dare not approach unto it for some secret in nature. Some\r\nhave said that cats will fight with Serpentes, and Toads, and kill them,\r\nand, perceiving that she is hurt by them, she presently drinketh water,\r\nand is cured: but I cannot consent unto this opinion.... _Ponzettus_\r\nsheweth by experience that cats and Serpents love one another, for\r\nthere was (sayth he) in a certain Monastery, a Cat norished by the\r\nMonkes, and suddenly the most part of the Monkes which used to play with\r\nthe Cat, fell sicke; whereof the Physitians could find no cause, but\r\nsome secret poyson, and al of them were assured that they never tasted\r\nany: at the last a poore laboring man came unto them, affirming that he\r\nsaw the Abbey-Cat playing with a Serpent, which the Physitians\r\nunderstanding, presently conceived that the Serpent had emptied some of\r\nher poyson upon the Cat, which brought the same to the Monkes, and they\r\nby stroking and handeling the Cat, were infected therewith; and whereas\r\nthere remained one difficulty, namely, how it came to passe the Cat\r\nherself was not poisoned thereby, it was resolved, that, forasmuch as\r\nthe Serpentes poison came from him but in playe and sporte, and not in\r\nmalice and wrath, that therefore the venom thereof being lost in play,\r\nneither harmed the Cat at al, nor much endangered the Monkes; and the\r\nvery like is observed of Myce that will play with Serpents....\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Those which will keepe their Cattes within doores, and from hunting\r\nBirds abroad, must cut off their eares, for they cannot endure to have\r\ndrops of raine distil into them, and therefore keep themselves in\r\nharbor.... They cannot abide the savour of oyntments, but fall madde\r\nthereby; they are sometimes infected with the falling evill, but are\r\ncured with _Gobium_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the great Cat, the Lion, the ancients give many wonderful stories,\r\nsome of them not altogether redounding to his character for bravery:--“A\r\nserpent, or snake doth easily kill a lion, where of _Ambrosius_ writeth\r\nvery elegantly. _Eximia leonis pulchritudo, per comantes cervicis toros\r\nexcutitur, cum subito a serpente os pectore tenus attolitur, itaque\r\nColuber cervum fugit sed Leonem interficit. The splendant beautie of a\r\nlion in his long curled mane is quickly abated, and allayed, when the\r\nserpent doth but lift up his head to his brest._ For such is the\r\nordinance of God, that the Snake, which runneth from a fearefull Hart,\r\nshould without all feare kill a courageous Lyon; and the writer of Saint\r\n_Marcellus_ life, _How much more will he feare a great Dragon, against\r\nwhom he hath not power to lift up his taile_. And _Aristotle_ writeth\r\nthat the Lyon is afraid of the Swine, and _Rasis_ affirmeth as much of\r\nthe mouse.\r\n\r\n“The Cocke also both seene and heard for his voice and combe, is a\r\nterror to the Lion and Basiliske, and the Lyon runneth from him when he\r\nseeth him, especially from a white cocke, and the reason hereof, is\r\nbecause they are both partakers of the Sunnes qualities in a high\r\ndegree, and therefore the greater body feareth the lesser, because there\r\nis a more eminent and predominant sunny propertie in the Cocke, than in\r\nthe Lion. _Lucretius_ describes this terrour notably, affirming that, in\r\nthe morning, when the Cocke croweth, the lions betake themselves to\r\nflight, because there are certain seedes in the body of Cockes, which\r\nwhen they are sent, and appeare to the eyes of Lions, they vexe their\r\npupils and apples, and make them, against Nature, become gentle and\r\nquiet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEONTOPHONUS--THE PEGASUS--THE CROCOTTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion has a dreadful enemy, according to Pliny, who says:--“We have\r\nheard speak of a small animal to which the name of _Leontophonus_[36]\r\nhas been given, and which is said to exist only in those countries where\r\nthe Lion is produced. If its flesh is only tasted by the Lion, so\r\nintensely venomous is its nature, that this lord of the other quadrupeds\r\ninstantly expires. Hence it is that the hunters of the Lion burn its\r\nbody to ashes, and sprinkle a piece of flesh with the powder, and so\r\nkill the Lion by means of its ashes even--so fatal to it is this poison!\r\nThe Lion, therefore, not without reason, hates the Leontophonus, and,\r\nafter destroying its sight, kills it without inflicting a bite: the\r\nanimal, on the other hand, sprinkles the Lion with its urine, being well\r\naware that this, too, is fatal to it.”\r\n\r\nWe have read, in the Romances of Chivalry, how that Guy, Earl of\r\nWarwick, having seen a Lion and a Dragon fighting, went to the\r\nassistance of the former, and, having killed its opponent, the Lion\r\nmeekly trotted after him, and ever after, until its death, was his\r\nconstant companion. How, in the absence of Sir Bevis of Hampton, two\r\nlions having killed the Steward Boniface, and his horse, laid their\r\nheads in the fair Josian’s lap. The old romancists held that a lion\r\nwould always respect a virgin, and Spenser has immortalised this in his\r\ncharacter of Una. Most of us remember the story given by Aulus Gellius\r\nand Ælian, of Androcles, who earned a lion’s gratitude by extracting a\r\nthorn from its paw, and Pliny gives similar instances:--\r\n\r\n“Mentor, a native of Syracuse, was met in Syria by a lion, who rolled\r\nbefore him in a suppliant manner; though smitten with fear, and desirous\r\nto escape, the wild beast on every side opposed his flight, and licked\r\nhis feet with a fawning air. Upon this, Mentor observed on the paw of\r\nthe lion, a swelling and a wound; from which, after extracting a\r\nsplinter, he relieved the creature’s pain.\r\n\r\n“In the same manner, too, Elpis, a native of Samos, on landing from a\r\nvessel on the coast of Africa, observed a lion near the beach, opening\r\nhis mouth in a threatening manner; upon which he climbed a tree, in the\r\nhope of escaping, while, at the same time, he invoked the aid of Father\r\nLiber (_Bacchus_); for it is the appropriate time for invocations where\r\nthere is no room left for hope. The wild beast did not pursue him when\r\nhe fled, although he might easily have done so; but, lying down at the\r\nfoot of the tree, by the open mouth which had caused so much terror,\r\ntried to excite his compassion. A bone, while he was devouring his food\r\nwith too great avidity, had stuck fast between his teeth, and he was\r\nperishing with hunger; such being the punishment inflicted upon him by\r\nhis own weapons, every now and then he would look up, and supplicate\r\nhim, as it were, with mute entreaties. Elpis, not wishing to risk\r\ntrusting himself to so formidable a beast, remained stationary for some\r\ntime, more at last from astonishment than from fear. At length, however,\r\nhe descended from the tree, and extracted the bone, the lion, in the\r\nmeanwhile, extending his head, and aiding in the operation as far as it\r\nwas necessary for him to do. The story goes on to say, that as long as\r\nthe vessel remained off that coast, the lion shewed his sense of\r\ngratitude by bringing whatever he had chanced to procure in the chase.”\r\n\r\nThe same author mentions two curious animals, the Leucrocotta, and the\r\nEale, which are noticeable among other wonders:--“Æthiopia produces the\r\nlynx in abundance, and the sphinx, which has brown hair and two mammæ on\r\nthe breast, as well as many monstrous kinds of a similar nature; horses\r\nwith wings, and armed with horns, which are called pegasi: the Crocotta,\r\nan animal which looks as though it had been produced by the union of the\r\nwolf and the dog, for it can break anything with its teeth, and\r\ninstantly, on swallowing it, it digests it with the stomach; monkeys,\r\ntoo, with black heads, the hair of the ass, and a voice quite unlike\r\nthat of any other animal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEUCROCOTTA--THE EALE--CATTLE FEEDING BACKWARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“There are oxen, too, like that of India, some with one horn, and others\r\nwith three; the leucrocotta, a wild beast of extraordinary swiftness,\r\nthe size of the wild ass, with the legs of a Stag, the neck, tail, and\r\nbreast of a lion, the head of a badger, a cloven hoof, the mouth slit\r\nup as far as the ears, and one continuous bone instead of teeth; it is\r\nsaid, too, that this animal can imitate the human voice.\r\n\r\n“Among the same people there is found an animal called the eale; it is\r\nthe size of the river-horse, has the tail of the elephant, and is of a\r\nblack or tawny colour. It has, also, the jaws of the wild boar and horns\r\nthat are moveable, and more than a cubit in length, so that, in\r\nfighting, it can employ them alternately, and vary their position by\r\npresenting them directly, or obliquely, according as necessity may\r\ndictate.”\r\n\r\nThe Eale, with its movable horns, is run hard by the Cattle of the\r\nLotophagi, which are thus described by Herodotus:--“From the Augilæ at\r\nthe end of another ten days’ journey is another hill of salt and water,\r\nand many fruit-bearing palm trees, as also in other places; and men\r\ninhabit it, who are called Gavamantes, a very powerful nation; they lay\r\nearth upon the salt, and then sow their ground. From these to the\r\nLotophagi, the shortest route is a journey of thirty days: amongst them\r\nthe kine that feed backwards are met with; they feed backwards for this\r\nreason. They have horns that are bent forward, therefore they draw back\r\nas they feed; for they are unable to go forward, because their horns\r\nwould stick in the ground. They differ from other kine in no other\r\nrespect than this, except that their hide is thicker and harder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already seen some of the wonderfully curative properties of\r\nanimals--let us learn something of their own medical attainments--as\r\ndescribed by Pliny. “The hippopotamus has even been our instructor in\r\none of the operations of medicine. When the animal has become too bulky,\r\nby continued overfeeding, it goes down to the banks of the river, and\r\nexamines the reeds which have been newly cut; as soon as it has found a\r\nstump that is very sharp, it presses its body against it, and so wounds\r\none of the veins in the thigh; and by the flow of blood thus produced,\r\nthe body, which would otherwise have fallen into a morbid state, is\r\nrelieved; after which, it covers up the wound with mud.\r\n\r\n“The bird, also, which is called the Ibis, a native of the same country\r\nof Egypt, has shewn us some things of a similar nature. By means of its\r\nhooked beak, it laves the body through that part by which it is\r\nespecially necessary for health, that the residuous food should be\r\ndischarged. Nor, indeed, are these the only inventions which have been\r\nborrowed from animals to prove of use to man. The power of the herb\r\n_dittany_, in extracting arrows, was first disclosed to us by stags that\r\nhad been struck by that weapon; the weapon being discharged on their\r\nfeeding upon this plant. The same animals, too, when they happen to have\r\nbeen wounded by the _phalangium_, a species of spider, or by any insect\r\nof a similar nature, cure themselves by eating crabs. One of the very\r\nbest remedies for the bite of the serpent, is the plant with which\r\nlizards treat their wounds when injured in fighting with each other. The\r\nswallow has shown us that the _chelidonia_ is very serviceable to the\r\nsight, by the fact of its employing it for the cure of its young, when\r\ntheir eyes are affected. The tortoise recruits its powers of effectually\r\nresisting serpents by eating the plant which is known as _cunile\r\nbubula_; and the weasel feeds on _rue_, when it fights with the serpent\r\nin pursuit of mice. The Stork cures itself of its diseases, with _wild\r\nmarjoram_, and the wild boar with _ivy_, as also by eating _crabs_, and,\r\nmore particularly, those that have been thrown up by the sea.\r\n\r\n“The snake, when the membrane which covers its body, has been contracted\r\nby the cold of winter, throws it off in the spring, by the aid of the\r\njuices of _fennel_, and thus becomes sleek and youthful in appearance.\r\nFirst of all it disengages the head, and then it takes no less than a\r\nday and a night in working itself out, and divesting itself of the\r\nmembrane in which it has been enclosed. The same animal, too, on finding\r\nits sight weakened during its winter retreat, anoints and refreshes its\r\neyes by rubbing itself on the plant called _fennel_, or _marathrum_;\r\nbut, if any of the scales are slow in coming off, it rubs itself against\r\nthe thorns of the _juniper_. The dragon relieves the nausea which\r\naffects it in spring, with the juices of the _lettuce_. The barbarous\r\nnations go to hunt the panther, provided with meat that has been rubbed\r\nwith _Aconite_, which is a poison. Immediately on eating it, compression\r\nof the throat overtakes them, from which circumstance it is, that the\r\nplant has received the name of _pardalianches_ (_pard-strangler_). The\r\nanimal, however, has found an antidote against this poison in human\r\nexcrements; besides which, it is so eager to get at them, that the\r\nshepherds purposely suspend them in a vessel, placed so high, that the\r\nanimal cannot reach them, even by leaping, when it endeavours to get at\r\nthem; accordingly, it continues to leap, until it has quite exhausted\r\nitself, and at last expires: otherwise, it is so tenacious of life that\r\nit will continue to fight, long after its intestines have been dragged\r\nout of its body.\r\n\r\n“When an elephant has happened to devour a chameleon, which is of the\r\nsame colour with the herbage, it counteracts this poison by means of the\r\n_wild olive_. Bears, when they have eaten of the fruit of the\r\n_Mandrake_, lick up numbers of Ants. The Stag counteracts the effect of\r\npoisonous plants by eating the _artichoke_. Wood pigeons, jackdaws,\r\nblackbirds, and partridges, purge themselves once a year by eating _bay_\r\nleaves; pigeons, turtle-doves, and poultry, with _wall pellitory_, or\r\n_helxine_; ducks, geese, and other aquatic birds of a similar nature,\r\nwith the _bulrush_. The raven, when it has killed a chameleon, a contest\r\nin which even the conqueror suffers, counteracts the poison by means of\r\nlaurel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SU.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopsell mentions a fearful beast called the Su. “There is a region in\r\nthe new-found world, called _Gigantes_, and the inhabitants thereof, are\r\ncalled _Patagones_; now, because their country is cold, being far in the\r\nSouth, they cloath themselves with the skins of a beast called in their\r\nowne toong _Su_, for by reason that this beast liveth for the most part\r\nneere the waters, therefore they cal it by the name of _Su_, which\r\nsignifieth water. The true image thereof, as it was taken by\r\n_Thenestus_, I have heere inserted, for it is of a very deformed shape,\r\nand monstrous presence, a great ravener, and an untamable wilde beast.\r\n\r\n“When the hunters that desire her skinne, set upon her, she flyeth very\r\nswift, carrying her yong ones upon her back, and covering them with her\r\nbroad taile; now, for so much as no dogge or man dareth to approach\r\nneere unto her, (because such is the wrath thereof, that in the pursuit\r\nshe killeth all that commeth near her:) The hunters digge severall\r\npittes or great holes in the earth, which they cover with boughes,\r\nsticks, and earth, so weakly, that if the beast chance at any time to\r\ncome upon it, she, and her young ones fall down into the pit, and are\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“This cruell, untamable, impatient, violent, ravening, and bloody beast,\r\nperceiving that her natural strength cannot deliver her from the wit and\r\npolicy of men, her hunters, (for being inclosed, she can never get out\r\nagaine) the hunters being at hand to watch her downfall, and worke her\r\noverthrowe, first of all to save her young ones from taking and taming,\r\nshe destroyeth them all with her own teeth; for there was never any of\r\nthem taken alive, and when she seeth the hunters come about her, she\r\nroareth, cryeth, howleth, brayeth, and uttereth such a fearefull,\r\nnoysome, and terrible clamor, that the men which watch to kill her, are\r\nnot thereby a little amazed; but, at last, being animated, because\r\nthere can be no resistance, they approach, and with their darts and\r\nspeares, wound her to death, and then take off her skin, and leave the\r\nCarcasse in the earth. And this is all that I finde recorded of this\r\nmost strange beast.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAMB-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a change from this awful animal, let us examine the _Planta Tartarica\r\nBorometz_--which was so graphically delineated by Joannes Zahn in 1696.\r\nAlthough this is by no means the first picture of it, yet it is the best\r\nof any I have seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA most interesting book[37] on the “Vegetable Lamb of Tartary” has been\r\nwritten by the late Henry Lee, Esq., at one time Naturalist of the\r\nBrighton Aquarium, and I am much indebted to it for matter on the\r\nsubject, which I could not otherwise have obtained.\r\n\r\nThe word _Borometz_ is supposed to be derived from a Tartar word\r\nsignifying a lamb, and this plant-animal was thoroughly believed in,\r\nmany centuries ago--but there seem to have been two distinct varieties\r\nof plant, that on which little lambs were found in pods, and that as\r\nrepresented by Zahn, with a living lamb attached by its navel to a short\r\nstem. This stalk was flexible, and allowed the lamb to graze, within\r\nits limits; but when it had consumed all the grass within its reach, or\r\nif the stalk was severed, it died. This lamb was said to have the actual\r\nbody, blood, and bones of a young sheep, and wolves were very fond of\r\nit--but, luckily for the lamb-tree, these were the only carnivorous\r\nanimals that would attack it.\r\n\r\nIn his “Histoire Admirable des Plantes” (1605) Claude Duret, of Moulins,\r\ntreats of the Borometz, and says: “I remember to have read some time\r\nago, in a very ancient Hebrew book entitled in Latin the _Talmud\r\nIerosolimitanum_, and written by a Jewish Rabbi Jochanan, assisted by\r\nothers, in the year of Salvation 436, that a certain personage named\r\nMoses Chusensis (he being a native of Ethiopia) affirmed, on the\r\nauthority of Rabbi Simeon, that there was a certain country of the earth\r\nwhich bore a zoophyte, or plant-animal, called in the Hebrew _Jeduah_.\r\nIt was in form like a lamb, and from its navel, grew a stem or root by\r\nwhich this Zoophyte, or plant-animal, was fixed attached, like a gourd,\r\nto the soil below the surface of the ground, and, according to the\r\nlength of its stem or root, it devoured all the herbage which it was\r\nable to reach within the circle of its tether. The hunters who went in\r\nsearch of this creature were unable to capture, or remove it, until they\r\nhad succeeded in cutting the stem by well-aimed arrows, or darts, when\r\nthe animal immediately fell prostrate to the earth, and died. Its bones\r\nbeing placed with certain ceremonies and incantations in the mouth of\r\none desiring to foretell the future, he was instantly seized with a\r\nspirit of divination, and endowed with the gift of prophecy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lee then says: “As I was unable to find in the Latin translation of\r\nthe Talmud of Jerusalem, the passage mentioned by Claude Duret, and was\r\nanxious to ascertain whether any reference to this curious legend\r\nexisted in the Talmudical books, I sought the assistance of learned\r\nmembers of the Jewish community, and, amongst them, of the Rev. Dr.\r\nHermann Adler, Chief Rabbi Delegate of the United Congregations of the\r\nBritish Empire. He most kindly interested himself in the matter, and\r\nwrote to me as follows: ‘It affords me much gratification to give you\r\nthe information you desire on the Borametz. In the Mishna _Kilaim_,\r\nchap. viii. § 5 (a portion of the Talmud), the passage occurs:\r\n“Creatures called _Adne Hasadeh_ (literally ‘lords of the field’) are\r\nregarded as beasts.” There is a variant reading, _Abne Hasadeh_ (stones\r\nof the field). A commentator, Rabbi Simeon, of Sens (died about 1235),\r\nwrites as follows, on this passage: ‘It is stated in the Jerusalem\r\nTalmud that this is a human being of the mountains: it lives by means of\r\nits navel: if its navel be cut, it cannot live. I have heard in the name\r\nof Rabbi Meir, the son of Kallonymos of Speyer, that this is the animal\r\ncalled _Jeduah_. This is the _Jedoui_ mentioned in Scripture (lit.\r\n_wizard_, Lev. xix. 31); with its bones witchcraft is practised. A kind\r\nof large stem issues from a root in the earth on which this animal,\r\ncalled _Jadua_, grows, just as gourds and melons. Only the _Jadua_ has,\r\nin all respects, a human shape, in face, body, hands, and feet. By its\r\nnavel it is joined to the stem that issues from the root. No creature\r\ncan approach within the tether of the stem, for it seizes and kills\r\nthem. Within the tether of the stem it devours the herbage all around.\r\nWhen they want to capture it, no man dares approach it, but they tear at\r\nthe stem until it is ruptured, whereupon the animal dies.’ Another\r\ncommentator, Rabbi Obadja, of Berbinoro, gives the same explanation,\r\nonly substituting ‘They aim arrows at the stem until it is ruptured,’\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n“The author of an ancient Hebrew work, _Maase Tobia_ (Venice, 1705),\r\ngives an interesting description of this animal. In Part IV. c. 10, page\r\n786, he mentions the Borametz found in Great Tartary. He repeats the\r\ndescription of Rabbi Simeon, and adds, that he has found, in ‘A New Work\r\non Geography,’ namely, that ‘the Africans (_sic_) in Great Tartary, in\r\nthe province of Sambulala, are enriched by means of seeds, like the\r\nseeds of gourds, only shorter in size, which grow and blossom like a\r\nstem to the navel of an animal which is called _Borametz_ in their\r\nlanguage, i.e. _lamb_, on account of its resembling a lamb in all its\r\nlimbs, from head to foot; its hoofs are cloven, its skin is soft, its\r\nwool is adapted for clothing, but it has no horns, only the hairs of its\r\nhead, which grow, and are intertwined like horns. Its height is half a\r\ncubit and more. According to those who speak of this wondrous thing, its\r\ntaste is like the flesh of fish, its blood as sweet as honey, and it\r\nlives as long as there is herbage within reach of the stem, from which\r\nit derives its life. If the herbage is destroyed or perishes, the animal\r\nalso dies away. It has rest from all beasts and birds of prey, except\r\nthe wolf, which seeks to destroy it.’ The author concludes by expressing\r\nhis belief that this account of the animal having the shape of a lamb is\r\nmore likely to be true than it is of human form.”\r\n\r\nAs I have said, there are several delineations of this Borametz or\r\nBorometz, but there is one, a frontispiece to the 1656 edition of the\r\n_Paridisi in Sole--Paradisus Terrestris_, of John Parkinson, Apothecary\r\nof London, in which, together with Adam and Eve, the _lamb-tree_ is\r\nshown as flourishing in the Garden of Eden; and Du Bartas, in “His\r\n_divine WEEKES And WORKES_” in his poem of Eden, (the first day of the\r\nsecond week), makes Adam to take a tour of Eden, and describes his\r\nwonder at what he sees, especially at the “lamb-plant.”\r\n\r\n    “Musing, anon through crooked Walks he wanders,\r\n    Round-winding rings, and intricate Meanders,\r\n    Fals-guiding paths, doubtfull beguiling strays,\r\n    And right-wrong errors of an end-less Maze:\r\n    Not simply hedged with a single border\r\n    Of _Rosemary_, cut-out with curious order,\r\n    In _Satyrs_, _Centaurs_, _Whales_, and _half-men-Horses_,\r\n    And thousand other counterfaited corses;\r\n    But with true Beasts, fast in the ground still sticking,\r\n    Feeding on grass, and th’ airy moisture licking:\r\n    Such as those _Bonarets_, in _Scythia_ bred\r\n    Of slender seeds, and with green fodder fed;\r\n    Although their bodies, noses, mouthes and eys,\r\n    Of new-yean’d Lambs have full the form and guise;\r\n    And should be very Lambs, save that (for foot)\r\n    Within the ground they fix a living root,\r\n    Which at their navell growes, and dies that day\r\n    That they have brouz’d the neighbour grass away.\r\n            O wondrous vertue of God onely good!\r\n    The Beast hath root, the Plant hath flesh and blood\r\n    The nimble Plant can turn it to and fro;\r\n    The nummed Beast can neither stir nor go:\r\n    The Plant is leaf-less, branch-less, void of fruit;\r\n    The Beast is lust-less, sex-less, fire-less, mute;\r\n    The Plant with Plants his hungry panch doth feed;\r\n    Th’ admired Beast is sowen a slender seed.”\r\n\r\nOf the other kind of “lamb-tree,” that which bears lambs in pods, we\r\nhave an account, in Sir John Maundeville’s Travels. “Whoso goeth from\r\nCathay to Inde, the high and the low, he shal go through a Kingdom that\r\nmen call Cadissen, and it is a great lande, there groweth a manner of\r\nfruite as it were gourdes, and when it is ripe men cut it a sonder, and\r\nmen fynde therein a beast as it were of fleshe and bone and bloud, as\r\nit were a lyttle lambe without wolle, and men eate the beaste and fruite\r\nalso, and sure it seemeth very strange.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the “Journall of Frier Odoricus,” which I have incorporated in my\r\nedition of “The Voiage and Travayle of Syr John Maundeville, Knight,” he\r\nsays: “I was informed also by certaine credible persons of another\r\nmiraculous thing, namely, that in a certaine Kingdome of the sayd Can,\r\nwherein stand the mountains called Kapsei (the Kingdomes name is Kalor)\r\nthere groweth great Gourds or Pompions, (_pumpkins_) which being ripe,\r\ndoe open at the tops, and within them is found a little beast like unto\r\na yong lambe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHIMÆRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAldrovandus gives us the accompanying illustration of a Chimæra, a\r\nfabulous Classical monster, said to possess three heads, those of a\r\nlion, a goat, and a dragon. It used so to be pictorially treated, but in\r\nmore modern times as Aldrovandus represents. The mountain _Chimæra_, now\r\ncalled Yanar, is in ancient Lycia, in Asia Minor, and was a burning\r\nmountain, which, according to Spratt, is caused by a stream of\r\ninflammable gas, issuing from a crevice. This monster is easily\r\nexplained, if we can believe Servius, the Commentator of Virgil, who\r\nsays that flames issue from the top of the mountain, and that there are\r\nlions in the vicinity; the middle part abounds in goats, and the lower\r\npart with serpents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARPY AND SIREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe conjunction of the human form with birds is very easy, wings being\r\nfitted to it, as in the case of angels--and as applied to beasts, this\r\ntreatment is very ancient, _vide_ the winged bulls of Assyria, and the\r\nclassical Pegasus, or winged horse. With birds, the best form in which\r\nit is treated in Mythology is the Harpy. This is taken from Aldrovandus,\r\nand fully illustrates the mixture of bird and woman, described by\r\nShakespeare in _Pericles_ (iv. 3):--\r\n\r\n    “_Cleon._              Thou’rt like the harpy,\r\n    Which to betray, dost, with thine angel’s face,\r\n    Seize with thine eagle’s talons.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen, also, we have the Siren, shown by this illustration, taken from\r\nPompeii. These Sea Nymphs were like the Harpies, depicted as a compound\r\nof bird and woman. Like them also, there were three of them; but,\r\nunlike them, they had such lovely voices, and were so beautiful, that\r\nthey lured seamen to their destruction, they having no power to combat\r\nthe allurements of the Sirens; whilst the Harpies emitted an infectious\r\nsmell, and spoiled whatever they touched, with their filth, and\r\nexcrements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLicetus, writing in 1634, and Zahn, in 1696, give the accompanying\r\npicture of a monster born at Ravenna in 1511 or 1512. It had a horn on\r\nthe top of its head, two wings, was without arms, and only one leg like\r\nthat of a bird of prey. It had an eye in its knee, and was of both\r\nsexes. It had the face and body of a man, except in the lower part,\r\nwhich was covered with feathers.\r\n\r\nMarcellus Palonius Romanus made some Latin verses upon this prodigy,\r\nwhich may be thus rendered into English:--\r\n\r\n    A Monster strange in fable, and deform\r\n    Still more in fact; sailing with swiftest wing,\r\n    He threatens double slaughter, and converts\r\n    To thy fell ruin, flames of living fire.\r\n    Of double sex, it spares no sex, alike\r\n    With kindred blood it fills th’ Æmathian plain;\r\n    Its corpses strew alike both street and sea.\r\n    There hoary Thetis and the Nereids\r\n    Swim shudd’ring through the waves, while floating wide\r\n    The fish replete on human bodies----. Such,\r\n    Ravenna, was the Monster which foretold\r\n    Thy fall, which brings thee now such bitter woe,\r\n    Tho’ boasting in thy image triumph-crowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARNACLE GOOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all extraordinary beliefs, that in the Barnacle Goose, which obtained\r\ncredence from the eleventh to the seventeenth centuries, is as wonderful\r\nas any. The then accepted fact that the Barnacle Goose was generated on\r\ntrees, and dropped alive in the water, dates back a hundred years before\r\nGerald de Barri. Otherwise Giraldus Cambrensis wrote in 1187, about\r\nthese birds, the following being a translation:--\r\n\r\n“There are here many birds which are called Bernacæ, which nature\r\nproduces in a manner contrary to nature, and very wonderful. They are\r\nlike marsh-geese, but smaller. They are produced from fir timber tossed\r\nabout at sea, and are at first like geese upon it. Afterwards they hang\r\ndown by their beaks, as if from a sea-weed attached to the wood, and are\r\nenclosed in shells that they may grow the more freely. Having thus, in\r\ncourse of time, been clothed with a strong covering of feathers, they\r\neither fall into the water, or seek their liberty in the air by flight.\r\nThe embryo geese derive their growth and nutriment from the moisture of\r\nthe wood or of the sea, in a secret and most marvellous manner. I have\r\nseen with my own eyes more than a thousand minute bodies of these birds\r\nhanging from one piece of timber on the shore, enclosed in shells, and\r\nalready formed. The eggs are not impregnated _in coitu_, like those of\r\nother birds, nor does the bird sit upon its eggs to hatch them, and in\r\nno corner of the world have they been known to build a nest. Hence the\r\nbishops and clergy in some parts of Ireland are in the habit of\r\npartaking of these birds, on fast days, without scruple. But in doing so\r\nthey are led into sin. For, if any one were to eat of the leg of our\r\nfirst parent, although he (Adam) was not born of flesh, that person\r\ncould not be adjudged innocent of eating flesh.”\r\n\r\nWe see here, that Giraldus speaks of these barnacles being developed on\r\nwreckage in the sea, but does not mention their growing upon trees,\r\nwhich was the commoner belief. I have quoted both Sir John Maundeville,\r\nand Odoricus, about the lamb-tree, which neither seem to consider very\r\nwonderful, for Sir John says: “Neverthelesse I sayd to them that I held\r\ny^t for no marvayle, for I sayd that in my countrey are trees y^t beare\r\nfruit, y^t become byrds flying, and they are good to eate, and that that\r\nfalleth on the water, liveth, and that that falleth on earth, dyeth,\r\nand they marvailed much thereat.” And the Friar, in continuation of his\r\nstory of the _Borometz_, says: “Even as I my selfe have heard reported\r\nthat there stand certaine trees upon the shore of the Irish Sea, bearing\r\nfruit like unto a gourd, which at a certaine time of the yeere doe fall\r\ninto the water, and become birds called Bernacles, and this is most\r\ntrue.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus, in speaking of the breeding of Ducks in Scotland, says:\r\n“Moreover, another _Scotch_ Historian, who diligently sets down the\r\nsecret of things, saith that in the _Orcades_, (_the Orkneys_) Ducks\r\nbreed of a certain Fruit falling in the Sea; and these shortly after,\r\nget wings, and fly to the tame or wild ducks.” And, whilst discoursing\r\non Geese, he affirms that “some breed from Trees, as I said of Scotland\r\nDucks in the former Chapter.” Sebastian Müenster, from whom I have taken\r\nthe preceding illustration, says in his _Cosmographia Universalis_:--“In\r\nScotland there are trees which produce fruit, conglomerated of their\r\nleaves; and this fruit, when, in due time, it falls into the water\r\nbeneath it, is endowed with new life, and is converted into a living\r\nbird, which they call the ‘tree goose.’ This tree grows in the Island\r\nof Pomonia, which is not far from Scotland, towards the North. Several\r\nold Cosmographers, especially Saxo Grammaticus, mention the tree, and it\r\nmust not be regarded as fictitious, as some new writers suppose.”\r\n\r\nIn Camden’s “Britannia” (translated by Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London)\r\nhe says, speaking of Buchan:--“It is hardly worth while to mention the\r\nclayks, a sort of geese; which are believed by some, (with great\r\nadmiration) to grow upon the trees on this coast and in other places,\r\nand, when they are ripe, to fall down into the sea; because neither\r\ntheir nests nor eggs can anywhere be found. But they who saw the ship,\r\nin which Sir Francis Drake sailed round the world, when it was laid up\r\nin the river Thames, could testify, that little birds breed in the old\r\nrotten keels of ships; since a great number of such, without life and\r\nfeathers, stuck close to the outside of the keel of that ship; yet I\r\nshould think, that the generation of these birds was not from the logs\r\nof wood, but from the sea, termed by the poets ‘the parent of all\r\nthings.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn “Purchas, his Pilgrimage,” is the voyage of Gerat de Veer to China,\r\n&c., in 1569--and he speaks of the Barnacle goose thus:--“Those geese\r\nwere of a perfit red colour, such as come to Holland about Weiringen,\r\nand every yeere are there taken in abundance, but till this time, it was\r\nnever knowne where they hatcht their egges, so that some men have taken\r\nupon them to write that they sit upon trees in Scotland, that hang over\r\nthe water, and such eggs that fall from them downe into the water,\r\nbecome young geese, and swim there out of the water: but those that fall\r\nupon the land, burst asunder, and are lost; but that is now found to be\r\ncontrary, that no man could tell where they breed their egges, for that\r\nno man that ever wee knew, had ever beene under 80°; nor that land under\r\n80° was never set downe in any card, much lesse the red geese that\r\nbreede therein.” He and his sailors declared that they had seen these\r\nbirds sitting on their eggs, and hatching them, on the coasts of Nova\r\nZembla.\r\n\r\nDu Bartas thus mentions this goose:--\r\n\r\n    “So, slowe Boötes underneath him sees,\r\n    In th’ ycie iles, those goslings hatcht of trees;\r\n    Whose fruitfull leaves, falling into the water,\r\n    Are turned, (they say) to living fowls soon after.\r\n    So, rotten sides of broken ships do change\r\n    To barnacles; O transformation strange!\r\n    ’Twas first a green tree, then a gallant hull,\r\n    Lately a mushroom, now a flying gull.”\r\n\r\nI could multiply quotations on this subject. Gesner and every other\r\nnaturalist believed in the curious birth of the Barnacle goose--and so\r\neven did Aldrovandus, writing at the close of the seventeenth century,\r\nfor from him I take this illustration. But enough has been said upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE EGG.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNo wonder that a credulous age, which could see nothing extraordinary in\r\nthe Barnacle goose, could also, metaphorically, swallow such an egg, as\r\nLicetus, first of all, and Aldrovandus, after him, gives us in the\r\naccompanying true picture. The latter says that a goose’s egg was found\r\nin France, (he leaves a liberal margin for locality,) which on being\r\nbroken appeared exactly as in the picture. Comment thereon is useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOON WOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne would have imagined that this Egg would be sufficient to test the\r\ncredulity of most people, but Aldrovandus was equal to the occasion, and\r\nhe gives us a “Moon Woman,” who lays eggs, sits upon them, and hatches\r\nGiants; and he gives this on the authority of Lycosthenes and Ravisius\r\nTextor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRIFFIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere always has been a tradition of birds being existent, of far\r\ngreater size than those usually visible.\r\n\r\nThe Maoris aver that at times they still hear the gigantic Moa in the\r\nscrub--and, even, if extinct, we know, by the state of the bones found,\r\nthat its extinction must have been of comparatively recent date. But no\r\none credits the Moa with the power of flight, whilst the Griffin, which\r\nmust not be confounded with the gold-loving Arimaspian Gryphon, was a\r\nnoble bird. Mandeville knew him:--“In this land (_Bactria_) are many\r\ngryffons, more than in other places, and some say they have the body\r\nbefore as an Egle, and behinde as a Lyon, and it is trouth, for they be\r\nmade so; but the Griffen hath a body greater than viii Lyons, and stall\r\nworthier (_stouter_, _braver_) than a hundred Egles. For certainly he\r\nwyl beare to his nest flying, a horse and a man upon his back, or two\r\nOxen yoked togither as they go at plowgh, for he hath longe nayles on\r\nhys fete, as great as it were hornes of Oxen, and of those they make\r\nCups there to drynke of, and of his rybes they make bowes to shoote\r\nwith.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus says they live in the far Northern mountains, that they\r\nprey upon horses and men, and that of their nails drinking-cups were\r\nmade, as large as ostrich eggs. These enormous birds correspond in many\r\npoints to the Eastern Ruc or Rukh, or the Rok of the “Arabian Nights,”\r\nof whose mighty powers of flight Sindbad took advantage.\r\n\r\nSer Marco Polo, speaking of Madagascar, says:--“’Tis said that in those\r\nother Islands to the south, which the ships are unable to visit because\r\nthis strong current prevents their return, is found the bird _Gryphon_,\r\nwhich appears there at certain seasons. The description given of it is,\r\nhowever, entirely different from what our stories and pictures make it.\r\nFor persons who had been there and had seen it, told Messer Marco Polo\r\nthat it was for all the world like an eagle, but one indeed of enormous\r\nsize; so big in fact, that its wings covered an extent of 30 paces, and\r\nits quills were 12 paces long, and thick in proportion. And it is so\r\nstrong that it will seize an Elephant in its talons, and carry him high\r\ninto the air, and drop him so that he is smashed to pieces: having so\r\nkilled him, the bird gryphon swoops down on him, and eats him at\r\nleisure. The people of those isles call the bird _Ruc_, and it has no\r\nother name. So I wot not if this be the real gryphon, or if there be\r\nanother manner of bird as great. But this I can tell you for certain,\r\nthat they are not half lion and half bird, as our stories do relate;\r\nbut, enormous as they be, they are fashioned just like an eagle.\r\n\r\n“The Great Kaan sent to those parts to enquire about these curious\r\nmatters, and the story was told by those who went thither. He also sent\r\nto procure the release of an envoy of his who had been despatched\r\nthither, and had been detained; so both those envoys had many wonderful\r\nthings to tell the Great Kaan about those strange islands, and about the\r\nbirds I have mentioned. They brought (as I heard) to the Great Kaan, a\r\nfeather of the said Ruc, which was stated to measure 90 Spans, whilst\r\nthe quill part was two palms in circumference, a marvellous object! The\r\nGreat Kaan was delighted with it, and gave great presents to those who\r\nbrought it.”\r\n\r\nThis quill seems rather large; other travellers, however, perhaps not so\r\ntruthful as Ser Marco, speak of these enormous quills. The Moa of New\r\nZealand (_Dinornis giganteus_) is supposed to have been the largest bird\r\nin Creation--and next to that is the _Æpyornis maximus_--_whose bones\r\nand egg have been found in Madagascar_. An egg is in the British Museum,\r\nand it has a liquid capacity of 2.35 gallons, but, alas, for the quill\r\nstory--this bird was wingless.\r\n\r\nThe Condor has been put forward as the real and veritable Ruc, but no\r\nliving specimens will compare with this bird as it has been\r\ndescribed--especially if we take the picture of it in Lane’s “Arabian\r\nNights,” where it is represented as taking up _three_ elephants, one in\r\nits beak, and one in each of its claws.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have a legend of a great bird which carried off men--and\r\nthere is a very graphic picture now on view at the White Wing of the\r\nBritish Museum, where one of these birds, having seized a man,\r\nfrightens, very naturally, the whole community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHŒNIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nPliny says of the Phœnix:--“Æthiopia and India, more especially produce\r\nbirds of diversified plumage, and such as quite surpass all\r\ndescription. In the front rank of these is the Phœnix, that famous bird\r\nof Arabia; though I am not sure that its existence is not a fable.\r\n\r\n“It is said that there is only one in existence in the whole world, and\r\nthat that one has not been seen very often. We are told that this bird\r\nis of the size of an eagle, and has a brilliant golden plumage around\r\nthe neck, whilst the rest of the body is a purple colour; except the\r\ntail, which is azure, with long feathers intermingled, of a roseate hue;\r\nthe throat is adorned with a crest, and the head with a tuft of\r\nfeathers. The first Roman who described this bird, and who has done so\r\nwith great exactness, was the Senator Manilius, so famous for his\r\nlearning; which he owed, too, to the instructions of no teacher. He\r\ntells us that no person has ever seen this bird eat, that in Arabia it\r\nis looked upon as sacred to the Sun; that it lives five hundred and\r\nforty years. That when it is old it builds a nest of Cassia and sprigs\r\nof incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays its body down\r\nupon them to die: that from its bones and marrow there springs at first\r\na sort of small worm, which, in time, changes into a little bird; that\r\nthe first thing it does is to perform the obsequies of its predecessor,\r\nand to carry the nest entire to the City of the Sun near Panchaia, and\r\nthere deposit it upon the altar of that divinity.\r\n\r\n“The same Manilius states also, that the revolution of the great year is\r\ncompleted with the life of this bird, and that then a new cycle comes\r\nround again with the same characteristics as the former one, in the\r\nseasons and the appearance of the stars; and he says that this begins\r\nabout midday of the day in which the Sun enters the sign of Aries. He\r\nalso tells us that when he wrote to the above effect, in the consulship\r\nof P. Licinius, and Cneius Cornelius, (B.C. 96) it was the two hundred\r\nand fifteenth year of the said revolution. Cornelius Valerianus says\r\nthat the Phœnix took its flight from Arabia into Egypt in the Consulship\r\nof Q. Plautius and Sextus Papinius, (A.D. 36). This bird was brought to\r\nRome in the Censorship of the Emperor Claudius, being the year from the\r\nbuilding of the City, 800, (A.D. 47) and it was exposed to public view\r\nin the Comitium. This fact is attested by the public Annals, but there\r\nis no one that doubts that it was a fictitious Phœnix.”\r\n\r\nCuvier seems to think that the bird described above was a Golden\r\nPheasant, brought from the interior of Asia--at a time when these birds\r\nwere unknown to civilised Europe.\r\n\r\nDu Bartas, in his metrical account of the Creation, mentions this winged\r\nprodigy:--\r\n\r\n    “The Heav’nly Phœnix first began to frame\r\n    The earthly _Phœnix_, and adorn’d the same\r\n    With such a Plume, that Phœbus, circuiting\r\n    From _Fez_ to _Cairo_, sees no fairer thing:\r\n    Such form, such feathers, and such Fate he gave her\r\n    That fruitfull Nature breedeth nothing braver:\r\n    Two sparkling eyes; upon her crown, a crest\r\n    Of starrie Sprigs (more splendent than the rest)\r\n    A goulden doun about her dainty neck,\r\n    Her brest deep purple, and a scarlet back,\r\n    Her wings and train of feathers (mixed fine)\r\n    Of orient azure and incarnadine.\r\n    He did appoint her Fate to be her Pheer,\r\n    And Death’s cold kisses to restore her heer\r\n    Her life again, which never shall expire\r\n    Untill (as she) the World consume in fire.\r\n    For, having passed under divers Climes,\r\n    A thousand Winters, and a thousand Primes;\r\n    Worn out with yeers, wishing her endless end,\r\n    To shining flames she doth her life commend,\r\n    Dies to revive, and goes into her Grave\r\n    To rise againe more beautifull and brave.\r\n    With Incense, Cassia, Spiknard, Myrrh, and Balm,\r\n    By break of Day shee builds (in narrow room)\r\n    Her Urn, her Nest, her Cradle, and her Toomb;\r\n    Where, while she sits all gladly-sad expecting\r\n    Some flame (against her fragrant heap reflecting)\r\n    To burn her sacred bones to seedfull cinders,\r\n    (Wherein, her age, but not her life, she renders.)\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And _Sol_ himself, glancing his goulden eyes\r\n    On th’ odoriferous Couch wherein she lies,\r\n    Kindles the spice, and by degrees consumes\r\n    Th’ immortall _Phœnix_, both her flesh and plumes.\r\n    But instantly, out of her ashes springs\r\n    A Worm, an Egg then, then a Bird with wings,\r\n    Just like the first, (rather the same indeed)\r\n    Which (re-ingendred of its selfly seed)\r\n    By nobly dying, a new Date begins,\r\n    And where she loseth, there her life she wins:\r\n    Endless by’r End, eternall by her Toomb;\r\n    While, by a prosperous Death, she doth becom\r\n    (Among the cinders of her sacred Fire)\r\n    Her own selfs Heir, Nurse, Nurseling, Dam and Sire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWALLOW.\r\n\r\n    “And is the swallow gone?\r\n      Who beheld it?\r\n      Which way sailed it?\r\n    Farewell bade it none?”\r\n\r\n    (_W. Smith, Country book._)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus answered this question, according to his lights, and when,\r\ndiscoursing on the Migration of Swallows he says:--“Though many Writers\r\nof Natural Histories have written that Swallows change their stations;\r\nthat is, when cold Winter begins to come, they fly to hotter Climats;\r\nyet oft-times, in the Northern Countries, Swallows are drawn forth, by\r\nchance by Fishermen, like a lump cleaving together, where they went\r\namongst the Reeds, after the beginning of Autumn, and there fasten\r\nthemselves bill to bill, wing to wing, feet to feet. For it is observed,\r\nthat they, about that time ending their most sweet note, (?) do so\r\ndescend, and they fly out peaceably after the beginning of the Spring,\r\nand come to their old Nests, or else they build new ones by their\r\nnatural care. Now that lump being drawn forth by ignorant young men (for\r\nthe old Fishermen that are acquainted with it, put it in again) is\r\ncarryed and laid on the Sea Shore, and by the heat of the Sun, the Lump\r\nis dissolved, and the Swallows begin to fly, but they last but a short\r\ntime because they were not set at liberty by being taken so soon, but\r\nthey were made captive by it. It hapneth also in the Spring, when they\r\nreturn freely, and come to their old Nests, or make new ones, if a very\r\ncold Winter come upon them, and much snow fall, they will all dye; that\r\nall that Summer you shall see none of them upon the Houses, or Banks,\r\nor Rivers; but a very few that came later out of the Waters, or from\r\nother Parts, which by Nature come flying thither, to repair their Issue.\r\nWinter being fully ended in _May_; For Husband-Men, from their Nests,\r\nbuilt higher or lower, take their Prognostications, whether they shall\r\nsowe in Valleys, or Mountains or Hills, according as the Rain shall\r\nincrease or diminish. Also the Inhabitants hold it an ill sign, if the\r\nSwallows refuse to build upon their houses; for they fear those\r\nHouse-tops are ready to fall.”\r\n\r\nThis is proper, and good, and what we might expect from Olaus Magnus;\r\nbut it is somewhat singular to see, printed in _Notes and Queries_ for\r\nOctober 22, 1864, the following:--\r\n\r\n“The Duke de R---- related to me, a few days ago, that in Sweden, the\r\nswallows, as soon as the winter begins to approach, plunge themselves\r\ninto the lakes, where they remain asleep and hidden under the ice till\r\nthe return of the summer; when, revived by the new warmth, they come out\r\nfrom the water, and fly away as formerly. While the lakes are frozen, if\r\nsomebody will break the ice in those parts where it appears darker than\r\nin the rest, he will find masses of swallows--cold, asleep, and half\r\ndead; which, by taking out of their retreat, and warming, he will see\r\ngradually to vivify again and fly.\r\n\r\n“In other countries they retire very often to the Caverns, under the\r\nrocks. As many of these exist between the City of Caen, and the Sea, on\r\nthe banks of the river Orne, there are found sometimes, during the\r\nwinter, piles of swallows suspended in these vaults, like bundles of\r\ngrapes. I witnessed the same thing, myself, in Italy; where, as well as\r\nin France, it is considered (as I have heard) very lucky by the\r\ninhabitants when swallows build nests on their habitations....\r\n_Rhodocanakis._”\r\n\r\nOf course, these stories of curious hybernation were pooh-poohed,\r\nalthough it could not be denied that the subaqueous hybernation of\r\nswallows is given in Goldsmith’s “Animated Nature,” and many other\r\nNatural Histories, which succeeded his.\r\n\r\nThe wintering of swallows in caverns, has another eye-witness in Edward\r\nWilliams (_Iolo Morganwg_), who in his “Poems, Lyrics, and Pastorals,”\r\npublished 1794, says:--“About the year 1768, the author, with two or\r\nthree more, found a great number of swallows in a torpid state, clinging\r\nin clusters to each other by their bills, in a cave of the sea-cliffs\r\nnear Dunraven Castle, in the County of Glamorgan. They revived after\r\nthey had been some hours in a warm room, but died a day or two after,\r\nthough all possible care had been taken of them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARTLET, AND FOOTLESS BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Martin, or, as in Heraldry it is written, _Martlet_, Guillim thus\r\nwrites:--“The Martlet, or Martinet, saith Bekenhawh, hath Legs so\r\nexceeding short, that they can by no means go: (_walk_) And thereupon,\r\nit seemeth, the _Grecians_ do call them _Apodes, quasi sine pedibus_;\r\nnot because they do want Feet, but because they have not such Use of\r\ntheir Feet, as other Birds have. And if perchance they fall upon the\r\nGround, they cannot raise themselves upon their Feet, as others do, and\r\nprepare themselves to flight. For this Cause they are accustomed to make\r\ntheir Nests upon Rocks and other high places, from whence they may\r\neasily take their flight, by Means of the Support of the Air. Hereupon\r\nit came, that this Bird is painted in Arms without Feet: and for this\r\nCause it is also given for a Difference of younger Brethren, to put them\r\nin mind to trust to their wings of Vertue and Merit, to raise\r\nthemselves, and not to their Legs, having little Land to put their foot\r\non.”\r\n\r\nThe Alerion is a small bird of the eagle tribe, heraldically depicted as\r\nwithout beak or feet.\r\n\r\nButler in “Hudibras” writes--\r\n\r\n            “Like a bird of paradise,\r\n    Or herald’s Martlet, has no legs,\r\n    Nor hatches young ones, nor lays eggs.”\r\n\r\nThe Bird of Paradise was unknown to the ancients, and one of the\r\nearliest notices of this bird is given in Magalhaen’s voyage in\r\n1521:--“The King of Bachian, one of the Molucca Islands, sent two dead\r\nbirds preserved, which were of extraordinary beauty. In size they were\r\nnot larger than the thrush: the head was small, with a long bill; the\r\nlegs were of the thickness of a common quill, and a span in length; the\r\ntail resembled that of the thrush; they had no wings, but in the place\r\nwhere wings usually are, they had tufts of long feathers, of different\r\ncolours; all the other feathers were dark. The inhabitants of the\r\nMoluccas had a tradition that this bird came from Paradise, and they\r\ncall it _bolondinata_, which signifies the ‘bird of God.’”\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, as trade increased, the skins of this bird were found to have\r\na high market value, but the natives always brought them, when they came\r\nto trade, with their legs cut off. Thence sprang the absurd rumour that\r\nthey had no legs, although in the early account just quoted, their legs\r\nare expressly mentioned. Linnæus called the emerald birds of Paradise\r\n_apoda_ or legless; whilst Tavernier says that these birds getting drunk\r\non nutmegs, fall helpless to the ground, and then the ants eat off their\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n    “But note we now, towards the rich _Moluques_,\r\n    Those passing strange and wondrous (birds) _Manueques_.\r\n    (Wond’rous indeed, if Sea, or Earth, or Sky,\r\n    Saw ever wonder swim, or goe, or fly)\r\n    None knowes their Nest, none knowes the dam that breeds them;\r\n    Foodless they live; for th’ Aire alonely feeds them:\r\n    Wingless they fly; and yet their flight extends,\r\n    Till with their flight, their unknown live’s-date ends.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we must leave warm climes, and birds of Paradise, and speak of\r\n“Birds shut up under the Snow.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“There are in the Northern Countries Wood-Cocks, like to pheasant for\r\nbigness, but their Tails are much shorter, and they are cole black all\r\nover their bodies, with some white feathers at the end of their Tails\r\nand Wings. The Males have a red Comb standing upright; the Females have\r\none that is low and large, and the colour is grey. These Birds are of an\r\nadmirable Nature to endure huge Cold in the Woods, as the Ducks in the\r\nWaters. But when the Snow covers the Superficies of the Earth, like to\r\nHills, all over, and for a long time presse down the boughs of the Trees\r\nwith their weight, they eat certain Fruits of the Birch-Tree, called in\r\n_Italian_ (_Gatulo_) like to a long Pear, and they swallow them whole,\r\nand that in so great quantity, and so greedily, that their throat is\r\nstuffed, and seems greater than all their body.\r\n\r\n“Then they part their Companies, and thrust themselves all over into the\r\nsnow, especially in _January_, _February_ and _March_, when Snow and\r\nWhirlwinds, Storms, and grievous Tempests, descend from the Clouds. And\r\nwhen they are covered all over, that not one of them can be seen, lying\r\nall in heaps, for certain weeks they live, with meat collected in their\r\nthroats, and cast forth, and resumed. The Hunter’s Dogs cannot find\r\nthem; yet by the Cunning of the crafty Hunters, it falls out, that when\r\nthe Dogs err in their scent, they, by signs, will catch a number of\r\nliving Birds, and will draw them forth to their great profit. But they\r\nmust do that quickly; because when they hear the Dogs bark, they\r\npresently rise like Bees, and take up on the Wing, and fly aloft. But,\r\nif they perceive that the Snow will be greater, they devour the foresaid\r\nFruit again, and take a new dwelling, and there they stay till the end\r\nof March: or, if the snow melt sooner, when the Sun goes out of _Aries_;\r\nfor then the snow melting, by an instinct of Nature (as many other\r\nBirds) they rise out of their holes to lay Eggs, and produce young ones;\r\nand this in Mountains where bryars are, and thick Trees. Males and\r\nFemales sit on the Eggs by turns, and both of them keep the Young, and\r\nchiefly the Male, that neither the Eagle nor Fox may catch them.\r\n\r\n“These Birds fly in great sholes together, and they remain in high\r\nTrees, chiefly Birch-Trees; and they come not down, but for propagation,\r\nbecause they have food enough on the top of their Trees. And when\r\nHunters or Countreymen, to whom those fields belong, see them fly all\r\nabroad, over the fields full of snow, they pitch up staves obliquely\r\nfrom the Earth, above the Snow, eight or ten foot high; and at the top\r\nof them, there hangs a snare, that moves with the least touch, and so\r\nthey catch these Birds; because they, when they Couple, leap strangely,\r\nas Partridges do, and so they fall into these snares, and hang there.\r\nAnd when one seems to be caught in the Gin, the others fly to free her,\r\nand are caught in the like snare. There is also another way to catch\r\nthem, namely with arrows and stalking-horses, that they may not suspect\r\nit....\r\n\r\n“There is also another kind of Birds called _Bonosa_, whose flesh is\r\noutwardly black, inwardly white: they are as delicate good meat as\r\nPartridges, yet as great as Pheasants. At the time of Propagation, the\r\nMale runs with open mouth till he foam; then the Female runs and\r\nreceives the same; and from thence she seems to conceive, and bring\r\nforth eggs, and to produce her young.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient fable so dear, even to modern poets, that Swans sing before\r\nthey die--was not altogether believed even in classical times, as saith\r\nPliny:--“It is stated that at the moment of the swan’s death, it gives\r\nutterance to a mournful song; but this is an error, in my opinion; at\r\nleast, I have tested the truth of the story on several occasions.” That\r\nsome swans have a kind of voice, and can change a note or two, no one\r\nwho has met with a flock or two of “hoopers,” or wild swans, can deny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus relates the fable--and quotes Plato, that the swan sings at\r\nits death, not from sorrow, but out of joy, at finishing its life. He\r\nalso gives us a graphic illustration of how swans may be caught by\r\nplaying to them on a lute or other stringed instrument, and also that\r\nthey were to be caught by men (playing music) with stalking-horses, in\r\nthe shape of oxen, or horses; and, in another page, he says, that not\r\nfar from London, the Metropolis of England, on the River Thames, may be\r\nfound more than a thousand domesticated swans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALLE, ALLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“There is also in this Lake (_the White Lake_) a kind of bird, very\r\nfrequent; and in other Coasts of the _Bothnick_ and _Swedish_ Sea, that\r\ncries incessantly all the Summer, _Alle, Alle_, therefore they are\r\ncalled all over, by the Inhabitants, _Alle, Alle_. For in that Lake such\r\na multitude of great birds is found, (as I said before) by reason of the\r\nfresh Waters that spring from hot springs, that they seem to cover all\r\nthe shores and rivers, especially Sea-Crows, or Cormorants, Coots, More\r\nHens, two sorts of Ducks, Swans, and infinite smaller Water Birds. These\r\nCrows, and other devouring birds, the hunters can easily take, because\r\nthey fly slowly, and not above two or four Cubits above the Water: thus\r\nthey do it on the narrow Rocks, as in the Gates of Islands, on the Banks\r\nof them, they hang black nets, or dyed of a Watry Colour upon Spears;\r\nand these, with Pulleys, will quickly slip up or down, that in great\r\nSholes they catch the Birds that fly thither by letting the Nets fall\r\nupon them: and this is necessary, because those Birds fly so slowly, and\r\nright forward; so that few escape. Also, sometimes Ducks, and other\r\nBirds are taken in these Nets. Wherefore these black, or slow Birds,\r\nwhether they swim or fly, are always crying _Alle, Alle_, which in\r\nLatine signifies _All, All_, (_Omnes_) and so they do when they are\r\ncaught in the Nets: and this voyce the cunning Fowler interprets thus,\r\nthat he hath not, as yet, all of them in his Nets; nor ever shall have,\r\nthough he had six hundred Nets.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOOPOE AND LAPWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the following bird is meant for the Hoopoe, or the Lapwing, I\r\nknow not. The Latin version has “De Upupis,” which clearly means\r\nHoopoes--and the translation says, “Of the Whoups or Lapwings”--I follow\r\nthe latter. “_Lapwings_, when at a set time they come to the Northern\r\nCountries from other parts, they foreshew the nearnesse of the Spring\r\ncoming on. It is a Bird that is full of crying and lamentation, to\r\npreserve her Eggs, or young. By importunate crying, she shews that Foxes\r\nlye hid in the grasse; and so she cries out in all places, to drive away\r\ndogs and other Beasts. They fight with Swallows, Pies, and Jackdaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“On Hillocks, in Lakes, she lays her Eggs, and hatcheth her young ones.\r\nMade tame she will cleane a house of Flyes, and catch Mice. She\r\nforeshews Rain when she cries; which also Field Scorpions do, called\r\nMares, Cuckows; who by flying overthwart, and crying loudly, foreshew\r\nRain at hand; also the larger Scorpions, with huge long snouts, fore\r\nsignifie Rain; so do Woodpeckers. There is a Bird also called Rayn, as\r\nbig as a Partridge that hath Feathers of divers colours, of a yellow,\r\nwhite, and black colour: This is supposed to live upon nothing but Ayr,\r\nthough she be fat, nothing is found in her belly. The Fowlers hunt her\r\nwith long poles, which they cast high in the Ayr to fright her, so that\r\nthey may catch the Bird flying down.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OSTRICH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nModern observation, and especially Ostrich farming, has thoroughly\r\nexploded the old errors respecting this bird. We believe in its powers\r\nof _swallowing_ anything not too large, but not in its _digesting_\r\neverything, and certainly not, as Muenster would fain have us believe,\r\nthat an Ostrich’s dinner consists of a church-door key, and a\r\nhorse-shoe. As matters of fact, we know that, when pursued, they do not\r\nbury their heads in the sand, or a bush; and instead of covering their\r\neggs with sand, and leaving the sun to hatch them, both the male and\r\nfemale are excellent, and model parents.\r\n\r\nPliny, however, says differently:--“This bird exceeds in height a man\r\nsitting on horseback, and can surpass him in swiftness, as wings have\r\nbeen given to aid it in running; in other respects Ostriches cannot be\r\nconsidered as birds, and do not raise themselves from the earth. They\r\nhave cloven talons, very similar to the hoof of the stag (_they have but\r\ntwo toes_); with these they fight, and they also employ them in seizing\r\nstones for the purpose of throwing at those who pursue them. They have\r\nthe marvellous property of being able to digest every substance without\r\ndistinction, but their stupidity is no less remarkable: for although the\r\nrest of their body is so large, they imagine when they have thrust their\r\nhead and neck into a bush, that the whole body is concealed.”\r\n\r\nGiovanni Leone Africano writes that “this fowle liveth in drie desarts\r\nand layeth to the number of ten or twelve egges in the sand, which being\r\nabout the bignesse of great bullets weigh fifteen pounds a piece; but\r\nthe ostrich is of so weak a memorie, that she presently forgetteth the\r\nplace where her egges were laid, and, afterwards the same, or some other\r\nostrich hen finding the said eggs by chance hatched and fostereth them\r\nas if they were certainely her owne. The chickens are no sooner crept\r\nout of the shell but they prowle up and downe the desarts for their\r\nfood, and before theyr feathers be growne they are so swifte that a man\r\nshall hardly overtake them. The ostrich is a silly and deafe creature,\r\nfeeding upon any thing which it findeth, be it as hard and indigestible\r\nas yron.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HALCYON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this bird, the Kingfisher, Aristotle thus discourses:--“The halcyon\r\nis not much larger than a sparrow; its colour is blue and green, and\r\nsomewhat purple; its whole body is composed of these colours as well as\r\nthe wings and neck, nor is any part without every one of these colours.\r\nIts bill is somewhat yellow, long and slight; this is its external form.\r\nIts nest resembles the marine balls which are called halosachnæ\r\n(_probably a Zoophyte_, Alcyonia) except in colour, for they are red; in\r\nform it resembles those sicyæ (cucumbers) which have long necks; its\r\nsize is that of a very large sponge, for some are greater, others less.\r\nThey are covered up, and have a thick solid part, as well as the cavity;\r\nit is not easily cut with a sharp knife, but, when struck or broken with\r\nthe hand, it divides readily like the halosachnæ. The mouth is narrow,\r\nas it were a small entrance, so that the sea water cannot enter, even if\r\nthe Sea is rough: its cavity is like that of the Sponge. The material of\r\nwhich the nest is composed is disputed, but it appears to be principally\r\ncomposed of the spines of the _belone_, for the bird lives on fish.”\r\n\r\nPliny says:--“It is a thing of very rare occurrence to see a halcyon,\r\nand then it is only about the time of the setting of the Vergiliæ, and\r\nthe summer and winter solstices; when one is sometimes to be seen to\r\nhover about a ship, and then immediately disappear. They hatch their\r\nyoung at the time of the winter solstice, from which circumstance those\r\ndays are known as the ‘halcyon days;’ during this period the sea is calm\r\nand navigable, the Sicilian sea in particular.”\r\n\r\n“Halcyon days” is used proverbially, but the Kingfisher had another\r\nvery useful trait. If a dead Kingfisher were hung up by a cord, it would\r\npoint its beak to the quarter whence the wind blew. Shakespeare mentions\r\nthis property in _King Lear_ (ii. 1):--\r\n\r\n                “Turn their halcyon beaks\r\n    With every gale and vary of their masters.”\r\n\r\nAnd Marlowe, in his _Jew of Malta_ (i. 1):--\r\n\r\n    “But now, how stands the wind?\r\n    Into what corner peers my halcyon bill?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PELICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fable of the Pelican “in her piety, vulning herself,” as it is\r\nheraldically described--is so well known, as hardly to be worth\r\nmentioning, even to contradict it. In the first place, the heraldic bird\r\nis as unlike the real one, as it is possible to be; but the legend seems\r\nto have had its origin in Egypt, where the vulture was credited with\r\nthis extraordinary behaviour, and this bird is decidedly more in\r\naccordance with the heraldic ideal. Du Bartas, singing of “Charitable\r\nbirds,” praises equally the Stork and the Pelican:--\r\n\r\n    “The _Stork_, still eyeing her deer _Thessalie_,\r\n    The _Pelican_ comforteth cheerfully:\r\n    Prayse-worthy Payer; which pure examples yield\r\n    Of faithfull Father, and Officious Childe:\r\n    Th’ one quites (in time) her Parents love exceeding,\r\n    From whom shee had her birth and tender breeding;\r\n    Not onely brooding under her warm brest\r\n    Their age-chill’d bodies bed-rid in the nest;\r\n    Nor only bearing them upon her back\r\n    Through th’ empty Aire, when their own wings they lack;\r\n    But also, sparing (This let Children note)\r\n    Her daintiest food from her own hungry throat,\r\n    To feed at home her feeble Parents, held\r\n    From forraging, with heavy Gyves of Eld.\r\n    The other, kindly, for her tender Brood\r\n    Tears her own bowells, trilleth-out her blood,\r\n    To heal her young, and in a wondrous sort,\r\n    Unto her Children doth her life transport:\r\n    For finding them by som fell Serpent slain,\r\n    She rends her brest, and doth upon them rain\r\n    Her vitall humour; whence recovering heat,\r\n    They by her death, another life do get.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TROCHILUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bird, as described by Aristotle, and others, is of a peculiar turn\r\nof mind:--“When the Crocodile gapes, the trochilus flies into its mouth\r\nto cleanse its teeth; in this process the trochilus procures food, and\r\nthe other perceives it, and does not injure it; when the Crocodile\r\nwishes the trochilus to leave, it moves its neck that it may not bite\r\nthe bird.”\r\n\r\nGiovanni Leone--before quoted--says, respecting this bird:--“As we\r\nsayled further we saw great numbers of crocodiles upon the banks of the\r\nilands in the midst of Nilus lye baking them in the sunne with their\r\njawes wide open, whereinto certaine little birds about the bignesse of a\r\nthrush entering, came flying forth againe presently after. The occasion\r\nwhereof was told me to be this: the crocodiles by reason of their\r\ncontinuall devouring beasts and fishes have certaine pieces of flesh\r\nsticking fast betweene their forked teeth, which flesh being putrified,\r\nbreedeth a kind of worme, wherewith they are cruelly tormented; wherefor\r\nthe said birds flying about, and seeing the wormes enter into the\r\nCrocodile’s jaws to satisfie their hunger thereon, but the Crocodile\r\nperceiving himselfe freede from the wormes of his teeth, offereth to\r\nshut his mouth, and to devour the little bird that did him so good a\r\nturne, but being hindred from his ungratefull attempt by a pricke which\r\ngroweth upon the bird’s head, hee is constrayned to open his jawes, and\r\nto let her depart.”\r\n\r\nDu Bartas gives another colour to the behaviour of the Trochilus:--\r\n\r\n    “The _Wren_, who seeing (prest with sleep’s desire)\r\n    _Nile’s_ poys’ny Pirate press the slimy shoar,\r\n    Suddenly coms, and, hopping him before,\r\n    Into his mouth he skips, his teeth he pickles,\r\n    Clenseth his palate, and his throat so tickles,\r\n    That, charm’d with pleasure, the dull _Serpent_ gapes.\r\n    Wider and wider, with his ugly chaps:\r\n    Then, like a shaft, th’ _Ichneumon_ instantly\r\n    Into the Tyrants greedy gorge doth fly,\r\n    And feeds upon that Glutton, for whose Riot,\r\n    All _Nile’s_ fat margents scarce could furnish diet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOLLY HENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John Maundeville saw in “the kingdome named Mancy, which is the best\r\nkingdome of the worlde--(Manzi, _that part of China south of the river\r\nHoang-ho_) whyte hennes, and they beare no feathers, but woll as shepe\r\ndoe in our lande.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO-HEADED WILD GEESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the land of the _Cynocephali_ or dog-headed men, there were many\r\nislands, and, “Also in this yle, and in many yles thereabout are many\r\nwyld geese with two heads.” But these were not the only extraordinary\r\nbreed of wild geese, extant.\r\n\r\n    “As the wise Wilde-geese, when they over-soar\r\n    Cicilian mounts, within their bills do bear,\r\n    A pebble stone both day and night: for fear\r\n    Lest ravenous Eagles of the North descry\r\n    Their Armies passage, by their Cackling Cry.”\r\n\r\nAristotle mentions the Crane as another stone-bearing bird:--“Among\r\nbirds, as it was previously remarked, the Crane migrates from one\r\nextremity of the earth to the other, and they fly against the wind. As\r\nfor the story of the stone, it is a fiction, for they say that they\r\ncarry a stone as ballast, which is useful as a touchstone for gold,\r\nafter they have vomited it up.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR-FOOTED DUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGesner describes a four-footed duck, which he says is like the English\r\npuffin, except in the number of its feet: but Aldrovandus “out-Herods\r\nHerod” when he gives us “A monstrous Cock with Serpent’s tail.”\r\n\r\nIf we can believe Pliny, there are places where certain birds are never\r\nfound:--“With reference to the departure of birds, the owlet, too, is\r\nsaid to lie concealed for a few days. No birds of this last kind are to\r\nbe found in the island of Crete, and if any are imported thither, they\r\nimmediately die. Indeed, this is a remarkable distinction made by\r\nNature; for she denies to certain places, as it were, certain kinds of\r\nfruits and shrubs, and of animals as well;...\r\n\r\n“Rhodes possesses no Eagles. In Italy, beyond the Padus, there is, near\r\nthe Alps, a lake known by the name of Larius, beautifully situate amid a\r\ncountry covered with shrubs; and yet this lake is never visited by\r\nstorks, nor, indeed, are they ever known to come within eight miles of\r\nit; whilst on the other hand, in the neighbouring territory of the\r\nMontres, there are immense flocks of magpies and jackdaws, the only bird\r\nthat is guilty of stealing gold and silver, a very singular propensity.\r\n\r\n“It is said that in the territory of Tarentum, the woodpecker of Mars is\r\nnever found. It is only lately, too, and that but very rarely, that\r\nvarious kinds of pies have begun to be seen in the districts that lie\r\nbetween the Apennines, and the City; birds which are known by the name\r\nof _Variæ_, and are remarkable for the length of the tail. It is a\r\npeculiarity of this bird, that it becomes bald every year at the time of\r\nsowing rape. The partridge does not fly beyond the frontiers of Bœotia,\r\ninto Attica; nor does any bird, in the island in the Euxine in which\r\nAchilles was buried, enter the temple there consecrated to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“In the territory of Fidenæ, in the vicinity of the City, the storks\r\nhave no young, nor do they build nests; but vast numbers of ring-doves\r\narrive from beyond sea every year in the district of Volaterræ. At Rome,\r\nneither flies, nor dogs ever enter the temple of Hercules in the Cattle\r\nMarket.”...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrestrial and Aerial animals were far more familiar to the Ancients\r\nthan were the inhabitants of the vast Ocean, and not knowing much about\r\nthem, their habits and ways, took “omne ignotum pro magnifico.”\r\n\r\nWe have seen the union of Man and Beast, and Man and Bird; and Man and\r\nFish was just as common, and perhaps more ancient than either of the\r\nformer--for Berosus, the Chaldean historian, gives us an account of\r\nOannes, or Hea, who corresponded to the Greek Cronos, who is identified\r\nwith the fish-headed god so often represented on the sculptures from\r\nNimroud, and of whom, clay figures have been found at Nimroud and\r\nKhorsabad, as well as numerous representations on seals and gems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf this mysterious union of Man and Fish, Berosus says:--“In the\r\nbeginning there were in Babylon a great number of men of various races,\r\nwho had colonised Chaldea. They lived without laws, after the manner of\r\nanimals. But in the first year there appeared coming out of the\r\nErythrian Sea (_Persian Gulf_) on the coast where it borders Babylonia,\r\nan animal endowed with reason, named Oannes. He had all the body of a\r\nfish, but below the head of the fish another head, which was that of a\r\nman; also the feet of a man, which came out of its fish’s tail. He had a\r\nhuman voice, and its image is preserved to this day. This animal passed\r\nthe day time among men, taking no nourishment. It taught them the use of\r\nletters, of sciences, and of arts of every kind; the rules for the\r\nfoundation of towns, and the building of temples, the principles of\r\nlaws, and geometry, the sowing of seeds, and the harvest; in one word,\r\nit gave to men all that conduced to the enjoyment of life. Since that\r\ntime nothing excellent has been invented. At the time of sunset, this\r\nmonster Oannes threw itself into the sea, and passed the night beneath\r\nthe waves, for it was amphibious. He wrote a book upon the beginning of\r\nall things, and of Civilisation, which he left to mankind.”\r\n\r\nHelladice quotes the same story, and calls the composite being Oes;\r\nwhile another writer, Hyginus, calls him Euahanes. M. Lenormant thinks\r\nthat it is evident that this latter name is more correct than Oannes,\r\nfor it points to one of the Akkadian names of Hea--“Hea-Khan,” _Hea, the\r\nfish_--and must be identified with the fish-God in the illustration.\r\n\r\nAlexander Polyhistor, who mainly copied from Berosus, says that Oannes\r\nwrote concerning the generation of Mankind, of their different ways of\r\nlife, and of their civil polity; and the following is the purport of\r\nwhat he wrote:--\r\n\r\n“There was a time in which there existed nothing but darkness, and an\r\nabyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were\r\nproduced on a twofold principle. There appeared men, some of whom were\r\nfurnished with two wings, others with four, and two faces. They had one\r\nbody, but two heads; the one that of a man, the other of a woman; they\r\nwere likewise in their several organs both male and female. Other human\r\nbeings were to be seen with the legs and horns of a goat; some had\r\nhorse’s feet, while others united the hind-quarters of a horse with the\r\nbody of a man, resembling in shape the hippocentaurs. Bulls likewise\r\nwere bred then with the heads of men, and dogs with fourfold bodies,\r\nterminated in their extremities with the tails of fishes; horses also\r\nwith the heads of dogs; men, too, and other animals, with the heads and\r\nbodies of horses, and the tails of fishes. In short, there were\r\ncreatures in which were combined the limbs of every species of animals.\r\nIn addition to these, fishes, reptiles, serpents, with other monstrous\r\nanimals, which assumed each other’s shape and countenance. Of all which\r\nwere preserved delineations in the temple of Belus, at Babylon.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut, undoubtedly, the earliest representation of the _real_\r\nMerman--half-man, half-fish--comes to us from the uncovered palace of\r\nKhorsabad. On a portion of its sculptured walls is a representation of\r\nSargon, the father of Sennacherib, sailing on his expedition to Cyprus,\r\nB.C. 720--on which occasion he had wooden images of the gods made and\r\nthrown overboard in order to accompany him on his voyage. Among these is\r\nHea, or Oannes, which I venture to assert is the first representation of\r\na Merman.\r\n\r\nIn Hindoo Mythology, one of the incarnations, or _avatars_ of Vishnu,\r\nrepresents him as issuing from the mouth of a fish. The God Dagon (Dag\r\nin Hebrew, signifying fish) was probably Oannes or Hea--and Atergatis\r\nwas depicted as a Mermaid, half-woman, half-fish. The Greeks worshipped\r\nher as Astarte, and later on as Venus Aphrodite she was perfect woman,\r\nstill, however, born of the Sea-foam, and attended by Tritons or Mermen.\r\n\r\nThese Tritons and Nereids, male and female, were firmly believed in by\r\nboth Greek and Roman--who both depicted them alike--the Triton,\r\nsometimes having a trident, sometimes without, but both Triton, and\r\nNereid, perfect man and woman, of high types of manly and feminine\r\nbeauty, to the waist--below which was the body of a fish of the\r\nClassical dolphin type. So ingrained have these forms become in\r\nhumanity, that it would seem almost impossible to realise a Merman, or\r\nMermaid, other than as usually depicted.\r\n\r\nPliny, of course, tells about them:--“A deputation of persons from\r\nOlisipo (_Lisbon_) that had been sent for the purpose, brought word to\r\nthe Emperor Tiberius that a Triton had been both seen and heard in a\r\ncertain cavern, blowing a Conch shell, and of the form they are usually\r\nrepresented. Nor yet is the figure generally attributed to the nereids\r\nat all a fiction, only in them the portion of the body that resembles\r\nthe human figure, is still rough all over with scales. For one of these\r\ncreatures was seen upon the same shores, and, as it died, its plaintive\r\nmurmurs were heard, even by the inhabitants, at a distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The legatus of Gaul, too, wrote word to the late Emperor Augustus, that\r\na considerable number of nereids had been found dead upon the sea-shore.\r\nI have, too, some distinguished informants of equestrian rank, who state\r\nthat they themselves once saw, in the Ocean of Gades, a sea-man, which\r\nbore in every part of his body, a perfect resemblance to a human being,\r\nand that during the night he would climb up into ships; upon which the\r\nside of the vessel, where he seated himself, would instantly sink\r\ndownward, and, if he remained there any considerable time, even go under\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\nÆlian tells us, that it is reported that the great sea which surrounds\r\nthe Island of Taprobana (_Ceylon_) contains an immense multitude of\r\nfishes and whales, and some of them have the heads of lions, panthers,\r\nrams, and other animals; and (which is more wonderful still) some of the\r\nCetaceans have the form of Satyrs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGesner obligingly depicts this Pan, Sea Satyr, Ichthyo centaurus, or Sea\r\nDemon, as he is indifferently called, and wants to pass it off as a\r\nveritable Merman, probably on account of its human-like trunk. He also\r\nquotes Ælian as to the authenticity of this monster,--and he gives a\r\npicture of another Man-fish, which he says was seen at Rome, on the\r\nthird of November, 1523. Its size was that of a boy about five years of\r\nage. (See next page.)\r\n\r\nMermen and Mermaids do not seem to affect any particular district, they\r\nwere met with all over the world--and records of their having been seen,\r\ncome to us from all parts. That was well, and occurred in the ages of\r\nfaith, but now the materialism of the present age would shatter, if it\r\ncould, our cherished belief in these Marine eccentricities, and would\r\nfain have us to credit that all those that have been seen, were some of\r\nthe Phocidæ, such as a “Dugong,” or else they would attempt to persuade\r\nus that a beautiful mermaid, with her comb and looking-glass, was\r\nneither more nor less than a repulsive-looking “Manatee.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSir J. Emerson Tennent quotes in his “Natural History of Ceylon” from\r\nthe description of one of the Dutch Colonial Chaplains, named Valentyn,\r\nwho wrote an account of the Natural History of Amboyna. He says that in\r\n1663, a lieutenant in the Dutch army was with some soldiers on the\r\nsea-beach at Amboyna, when they all saw mermen swimming near the beach.\r\nHe described them as having long and flowing hair, of a colour between\r\ngrey and green. And he saw them again, after an interval of six weeks,\r\nwhen he was in company with some fifty others. He also says that these\r\nMarine Curiosities, both male and female, have been taken at Amboyna:\r\nand he cites a special one, of which he gives a portrait, that was\r\ncaptured by a district visitor of the Church, and presented by him to\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nThis last animal enjoyed European fame, as in 1716, whilst Peter the\r\nGreat was the guest of the British Ambassador at Amsterdam, the latter\r\nwrote to Valentyn, asking that the marvel should be sent over for the\r\nCzar’s inspection--but it came not. Valentyn also tells how, in the year\r\n1404, a mermaid, tempest-tossed, was driven through a breach in a dyke\r\nat Edam, in Holland, and was afterwards taken alive in the lake of\r\nParmen, whence she was carried to Haarlem. The good Dutch vrows took\r\nkindly care of her, and, with their usual thriftiness, taught her a\r\nuseful occupation, that of spinning; nay, they Christianised her--and\r\nshe died a Roman Catholic, several years after her capture.\r\n\r\nThe authentic records, if trust can be placed in them, are various and\r\nmany--but are hardly worth recapitulating because of their sameness, and\r\nthe smile of incredulity which their recital provokes.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore turn to the monarch of the deep, the Whale--and of this\r\ncreature we get curious glimpses from the Northern Naturalists; but,\r\nbefore investigating this authentic denizen of ocean, we will examine\r\nsome whose title to existence is not quite so clearly made out. Olaus\r\nMagnus gives us an introduction to some of “The horrible Monsters of the\r\nCoast of Norway. There are monstrous fish on the Coasts or Sea of\r\n_Norway_, of unusual Names, though they are reputed a kind of _Whales_;\r\nand, if men look long on them they will fright and amaze them. Their\r\nforms are horrible, their heads square, all set with prickles, and they\r\nhave sharp and long Horns round about, like a tree rooted up by the\r\nroots: they are ten or twelve Cubits long, very black, and with huge\r\neyes, the Compass whereof (i.e., _of the fish_) is above eight or ten\r\nCubits: the apple of the eye is of one Cubit, and is red and fiery\r\ncoloured, which in the dark night appears to Fisher-men afar off under\r\nWaters, as a burning Fire, having hairs like Goose-Feathers, thick and\r\nlong, like a beard hanging down; the rest of the body, for the greatness\r\nof the head, which is square, is very small, not being above fourteen or\r\nfifteen cubits long; one of these Sea Monsters will drown easily many\r\ngreat ships, provided with many strong Marriners.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe also speaks of a Cetacean, called a Physeter:--“The Whirlpool, or\r\nPrister, is of the kind of Whales, two hundred Cubits long, and is very\r\ncruel. For, to the danger of Sea men, he will sometimes raise himself\r\nbeyond the Sail yards, and cast such floods of Waters above his head,\r\nwhich he had sucked in, that with a cloud of them, he will often sink\r\nthe strongest ships, or expose the Marriners to extream danger. This\r\nBeast hath also a long and large round mouth like a Lamprey, whereby he\r\nsucks in his meat or water, and by his weight cast upon the Fore or\r\nHinder-Deck, he sinks, and drowns a ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, not content to do hurt by water onely, as I said, he will\r\ncruelly over throw the ship like any small Vessel, striking it with his\r\nback, or tail. He hath a thick black Skin, all his body over; long fins,\r\nlike to broad feet, and a forked tail 15 or 20 foot broad, wherewith he\r\nforcibly binds any parts of the ship, he twists it about. A Trumpet of\r\nWar is the fit remedy against him, by reason of the sharp noise, which\r\nhe cannot endure: and by casting out huge great Vessels, that hinders\r\nthis Monster’s passage, or for him to play withall; or with Strong Canon\r\nand Guns, with the sound thereof he is more frighted, than with a Stone,\r\nor Iron Bullett; because this Ball loseth its force, being hindered by\r\nhis Fat, or by the Water, or wounds but a little, his most vast body,\r\nthat hath a Rampart of mighty Fat to defend it. Also, I must add, that\r\non the Coasts of _Norway_, most frequently both Old and New Monsters are\r\nseen, chiefly by reason of the inscrutable depth of the Waters.\r\nMoreover, in the deep Sea, there are many kinds of fishes that are\r\nseldome or never seen by Man.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have the saying, “Throw a tub to the Whale,” and we not only find\r\nthat it is the proper treatment to conciliate Physeters, but Gesner\r\nshows us the real thing applied to Whales, trumpet and all complete, and\r\nhe also shows us the close affinity between the Whale and the Physeter,\r\nin the accompanying illustration, which depicts a whale uprearing, and\r\ncoming down again on an unfortunate vessel.\r\n\r\nThere is another Whale, described by Gesner, which he calls the “Trol”\r\nwhale, or in German, “Teüfelwal,” or Devil Whale. This whale lies asleep\r\non the water, and is of such a deceptive appearance that seamen mistake\r\nit for an island, and cast anchor into it, a proceeding which this\r\npeculiar class of whale does not appear to take much heed of. But, when\r\nit comes to lighting a fire upon it, and cooking thereon, it naturally\r\nwakes up the whale. It is of this “Teüfelwal” that Milton writes\r\n(“Paradise Lost,” Bk. i., l. 200):--\r\n\r\n                    “Or that sea-beast\r\n    Leviathan, which God of all His works\r\n    Created hugest that swim the ocean-stream.\r\n    Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,\r\n    The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,\r\n    Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,\r\n    With fixèd anchor in his scaly rind,\r\n    Moors by his side under the lee, while night\r\n    Invests the sea, and wishèd morn delays.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd the same story is told in the First Voyage of Sindbad the Sailor,\r\nor, as Mr. Lane, whose translation (ed. 1883) I use, calls him,\r\nEs-Sindibád of the Sea:--“We continued our voyage until we arrived at an\r\nisland like one of the gardens of Paradise, and at that island, the\r\nmaster of the ship brought her to anchor with us. He cast the anchor,\r\nand put forth the landing plank, and all who were in the ship landed\r\nupon that island. They had prepared for themselves fire-pots, and they\r\nlighted the fires in them, and their occupations were various: some\r\ncooked, others washed, and others amused themselves. I was among those\r\nwho were amusing themselves upon the shores of the island, and the\r\npassengers were assembled to eat and drink, and play and sport. But\r\nwhile we were thus engaged, lo, the master of the ship, standing upon\r\nits side, called out with his loudest voice, ‘O ye passengers, whom may\r\nGod preserve! come up quickly into the ship, hasten to embark, and leave\r\nyour merchandise, and flee with your lives, and save yourselves from\r\ndestruction; for this apparent island upon which ye are, is not, in\r\nreality, an island, but it is a great fish that hath become stationary\r\nin the midst of the sea, and the sand hath accumulated upon it, so that\r\nit hath become like an island, and trees have grown upon it, since times\r\nof old; and, when ye lighted upon it the fire, it felt the heat, and put\r\nitself in motion, and now it will descend with you into the sea, and ye\r\nwill all be drowned; then seek for yourselves escape before destruction,\r\nand leave the merchandise!’ The passengers, therefore, hearing the words\r\nof the master of the ship, hastened to go up into the vessel, leaving\r\nthe merchandise, and their other goods, and their copper cooking-pots,\r\nand their fire-pots; and some reached the ship, and others reached it\r\nnot. The island had moved, and descended to the bottom of the sea, with\r\nall that were upon it, and the roaring sea, agitated with waves, closed\r\nover it.”\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus, too, tells of sleeping whales being mistaken for\r\nislands:--“The Whale hath upon its Skin a superficies, like the gravel\r\nthat is by the sea side; so that oft times when he raiseth his back\r\nabove the waters, Sailors take it to be nothing else but an Island, and\r\nsayl unto it, and go down upon it, and they strike in piles upon it, and\r\nfasten them to their ships: they kindle fires to boyl their meat; until\r\nat length the Whale feeling the fire, dives down to the bottome; and\r\nsuch as are upon his back, unless they can save themselves by ropes\r\nthrown forth of the ship, are drown’d. This Whale, as I have said before\r\nof the Whirlpool and Pristes, sometimes so belcheth out the waves that\r\nhe hath taken in, that, with a Cloud of Waters, oft times, he will drown\r\nthe ship; and when a Tempest ariseth at Sea, he will rise above water,\r\nthat he will sink the ships, during these Commotions and Tempests.\r\nSometimes he brings up Sand on his back, upon which, when a Tempest\r\ncomes, the Marriners are glad that they have found Land, cast Anchor,\r\nand are secure on a false ground; and when as they kindle their fires,\r\nthe Whale, so soon as he perceives it, he sinks down suddenly into the\r\ndepth, and draws both men and ships after him, unless the Anchors\r\nbreak.”\r\n\r\nBut _apropos_ of the whale casting forth such quantities of water, it\r\nis, as a matter of fact, untrue. The whale has a tremendously strong\r\nexhalation, and when it breathes under water, its breath sends up two\r\ncolumns of _spray_, but, if its head is above water, it cannot spout.\r\n\r\nOne thing in favour of whales, is “The Wonderful affection of the whales\r\ntowards their young. Whales, that have no Gills, breathe by Pipes, which\r\nis found but in few creatures. They carry their young ones, when they\r\nare weak and feeble; and if they be small, they take them in at their\r\nmouths. This they do also when a Tempest is coming; and after the\r\nTempest, they Vomit them up. When for want of water their young are\r\nhindered, that they cannot follow their Dams, the Dams take water in\r\ntheir mouths, and cast it to them like a river, that she may so free\r\nthem from the Land they are fast upon. Also she accompanies them long,\r\nwhen they are grown up; but they quickly grow up, and increase ten\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAccording to Olaus Magnus, there be many kinds of whales:--“Some are\r\nhairy, and of four Acres in bigness; the Acre is 240 foot long and 120\r\nbroad; some are smooth skinned, and those are smaller, and are taken in\r\nthe West and Northern Sea; some have their Jaws long and full of teeth;\r\nnamely, 12 or 14 foot long, and the Teeth are 6, 8, or 12 foot long. But\r\ntheir two Dog teeth, or Tushes, are longer than the rest, underneath,\r\nlike a Horn, like the teeth of Bores, or Elephants. This kind of whale\r\nhath a fit mouth to eat, and his eyes are so large, that fifteen men may\r\nsit in the room of each of them, and sometimes twenty, or more, as the\r\nbeast is in quantity.\r\n\r\n“His horns are 6 or 7 foot long, and he hath 250 upon each eye, as hard\r\nas horn, that he can stir stiff or gentle, either before or behind.\r\nThese grow together, to defend his eyes in tempestuous weather, or when\r\nany other Beast that is his enemy sets upon him; nor is it a wonder,\r\nthat he hath so many Horns, though they be very troublesome to him;\r\nwhen, as between his eyes, the space of his forehead is 15 or 20 foot.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Spermaceti whale (_Physeter macrocephalus_) is the subject of a\r\ncurious story, according to Olaus Magnus. He declares Ambergris is the\r\nsperm of the male Whale, which is not received by the female. “It is\r\nscattered wide on the sea, in divers figures, of a blew colour, but more\r\ntending to white; and these are glew’d together; and this is carefully\r\ncollected by Marriners, as I observed, when, in my Navigation I saw it\r\nscattered here and there: This they sell to Physitians, to purge it; and\r\nwhen it is purged, they call it _Amber-greese_, and they use it against\r\nthe Dropsie and Palsie, as a principal and most pretious unguent. It is\r\nwhite; and if it be found, that is of the colour of Gyp, it is the\r\nbetter. It is sophisticated with the powder of Lignum, Aloes, Styrax,\r\nMusk, and some other things. But this is discovered because that which\r\nis sophistocated will easily become soft as Wax, but pure _Amber-greese_\r\nwill never melt so. It hath a corroborating force, and is good against\r\nswoundings and the Epilepsie.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it is believed to be a morbid secretion in the\r\nintestinal canal of the whale, originating in its bile. It is found in\r\nits bowels, and also floating on the sea, grey-coloured, in lumps\r\nweighing from half an ounce to one hundred pounds. Its price is about £3\r\nper oz. It is much used in perfumery, but not in medicine, at least in\r\nEurope: but in Asia and Africa, it is, in some parts, so used, and also\r\nin cookery.\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus, too, tells us of the benefits the whale confers on the\r\ninhabitants of the cold and dreary North. How they salt the flesh for\r\nfuture eating, and the usefulness of the fat for lighting and warming\r\nthrough the long Arctic winter, while the small bones are used as fuel.\r\nOf the skin of this useful mammal, they make Belts, Bags, and Ropes,\r\nwhilst a whole skin will clothe forty men. But these are not all its\r\nuses.\r\n\r\n“Having spoken that the bodies of Whales are very large, for their head,\r\nteeth, eyes, mouth and skin; the bones require a place to be described;\r\nand it is thus. Because the vehemency of Cold in the farther parts of\r\nthe North, and horrid Tempests there, will hardly suffer Trees to grow\r\nup tall, whereof necessary houses may be builded: therefore provident\r\nNature hath provided for the Inhabitants, that they may build their\r\nhouses of the most vast Ribs of Sea Creatures, and other things\r\nbelonging thereunto. For these monsters of the Sea, being driven to\r\nland, either by some others that are their Enemies, or drawn forth by\r\nthe frequent fishing for them by men, that the Inhabitants there may\r\nmake their prey of them, or whether they die and consume; it is certain,\r\nthat they leave such vast bones behind them, that whole Mansion Houses\r\nmay be made of them, for Walls, Gates, Windows, Coverings, Seats, and\r\nfor Tables also. For these Ribs are 20, 30, or more feet in length.\r\nMoreover the Back-bones, and Whirl-bones, and the Forked-bones of the\r\nvast head, are of no small bigness: and all these by the industry of\r\nArtists, are so fitted with Saws and Files, that the Carpenter in Wood,\r\njoyn’d together with Iron, can make nothing more compleat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“When, therefore, the flesh of this most huge Beast is eat and\r\ndissolved, onely his bones remain like a great Keel; and when these are\r\npurged by Rain, and the Ayr, they raise them up like a house, by the\r\nforce of men that are called unto it. Then by the industry of the Master\r\nBuilder, Windows being placed on the top of the house, or sides of the\r\nWhale, it is divided into many convenient Habitations; and gates are\r\nmade of the same Beasts Skin, that is taken off long before, for that\r\nand some other use, and is hardened by the sharpness of the winds. Also\r\na part within this Keel raised up like a house, they make several Hog\r\nSties and places for other creatures, as the fashion is in other houses\r\nof Wood; leaving always under the top of this structure, a place for\r\nCocks, that serve instead of Clocks, that men may be raised to their\r\nlabour in the night, which is there continual in the Winter-time. They\r\nthat sleep between these Ribs, see no other Dreams, than as if they were\r\nalways toiling in the Sea-waves, or were in danger of Tempests, to\r\nsuffer shipwreck.”\r\n\r\nBesides men, Whales had their foes, in the deep, and there was,\r\naccording to Du Bartas, one very formidable and cunning enemy, in the\r\nshape of a bird:--\r\n\r\n    “Meanwhile the _Langa_, skimming, (as it were,)\r\n    The Ocean’s surface, seeketh everywhere,\r\n    The hugy Whale; where slipping in (by Art),\r\n    In his vast mouth, shee feeds upon his Hart.”\r\n\r\nBut it is cheering to find, on the authority of the same author, that he\r\nalso has a helpful friend:--\r\n\r\n    “As a great Carrak, cumbred and opprest\r\n    With her-self’s burthen, wends not East and West,\r\n    Star-boord, and Lar-boord, with so quick Careers\r\n    As a small Fregat, or swift Pinnass steers;\r\n    And as a large and mighty limbed Steed,\r\n    Either of _Friseland_, or of _German_ breed,\r\n    Can never manage half so readily,\r\n    As _Spanish_ Jennet, or light _Barbarie_;\r\n    So the huge _Whale_ hath not so nimble motion\r\n    As smaller fishes that frequent the Ocean;\r\n    But, sometimes, rudely ’gainst a Rock he brushes,\r\n    Or in some roaring straight he blindly rushes,\r\n    And scarce could live a Twelve month to an end,\r\n    But for the little _Musculus_ (his friend),\r\n    A little Fish, that, swimming still before,\r\n    Directs him safe from Rock, from shelf and shoar.”\r\n\r\nBut we have only spoken of a very few varieties of Whales; some yet\r\nremain, which may be styled “fancy” Whales. At all events, they are lost\r\nto our times. Herodotus tells us that in the Borysthenes (_Dneiper_)\r\nwere “large whales without any spinal bones, which they call Antacæi,\r\nfit for salting.” Then, Gesner gives us varieties of Whales, of which we\r\nknow nothing. There is the bearded and maned creature with a face\r\nsomewhat resembling that of a human being, found only in the remotest\r\nNorth, and there is the hairy whale, _Cetum Capillatum vel Crinitum_, or\r\n_Germanice_, Haarwal, but no particulars of this curious creature are\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe presents us with the image of a Cetacean, which he calls an Indian\r\nSerpent--but he evidently is so doubtful of the creature’s authenticity\r\nthat he tells us that Hieronimus Cardanus sent it formerly to him. He\r\ncannot quite make it out, with its monkey’s head, and paws, but points\r\nout that it must be an aquatic animal, because of its tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn his _Addenda et Emendanda_, he gives, on the authority of Olaus\r\nMagnus, a picture of an unnamed Whale--he says it was of great size, and\r\nhad terrible teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe also gives us two or three curious pictures of now extinct Cetaceans,\r\nsomething like terrestrial animals or men. And the first is a Leonine\r\nMonster, and for its authority he quotes Rondeletius.\r\n\r\nThis creature had none of its parts fitted to act as a marine animal of\r\nprey, but he says that Gisbertus (_Horstius_) Germanus, a physician at\r\nRome, certifies that it was taken on the high seas, not long before the\r\ndeath of Pope Paul III., which took place A.D. 1549. It was of the size\r\nand shape of a Lion, it had four feet, not mutilated, or imperfect as\r\nthose of the Seal, and not joined together as is the case with the\r\nbeaver or duck, but perfect, and divided into toes with nails: a long\r\nthin tail ending in hair; ears hardly visible, and its body covered with\r\nscales--but he adds that Gisbertus found fault with the artist, who had\r\nmade the feet longer than they ought to have been--and the ears too\r\nlarge for an aquatic animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGesner also gives us (and so does Aldrovandus) pictures of the Monk\r\nand Bishop fishes. The Monk-fish, he says, was caught off Norway, in a\r\ntroubled sea: and he quotes Bœothius as describing a similar monster\r\nfound in the Firth of Forth. The Bishop-fish was only _seen_ off the\r\ncoast of Poland, A.D. 1531.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe existence of these marine monsters had, at all events, very wide\r\ncredence, even if they never existed, for Sluper, whom I have before\r\nquoted, gives, in his curious little book, two pictures of these two\r\nfishes (more awful than Gesner did). Of the Sea Monk he says:\r\n\r\n    “La Mer poissons en abondance apporte,\r\n    Par dons divins que devons estimer.\r\n    Mais fort estrange est le Moyne de Mer,\r\n    Qui est ainsi que ce pourtrait le porte.”\r\n\r\nAnd of the Sea Bishop:\r\n\r\n    “La terre n’a Evesques seulement,\r\n    Qui sōt p̱ bulle en grād hōneur et titre,\r\n    L’evesque croist en mer sembablement,\r\n    Ne parlāt point, cōbien qu’il porte Mitre.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd Du Bartas writes of them, as if all in air, or on the earth, had its\r\ndouble in the sea--and he specially mentions these piscine\r\necclesiastics:--\r\n\r\n    “Seas have (as well as skies) Sun, Moon, and Stars;\r\n    (As well as ayre) Swallows, and Rooks, and Stares;\r\n    (As well as earth) Vines, Roses, Nettles, Millions,[38]\r\n    Pinks, Gilliflowers, Mushrooms, and many millions\r\n    Of other Plants (more rare and strange than these)\r\n    As very fishes living in the Seas.\r\n    And also Rams, Calfs, Horses, Hares, and Hogs,\r\n    Wolves, Lions, Urchins, Elephants and Dogs,\r\n    Yea, Men and Mayds; and (which I more admire[39])\r\n    The mytred Bishop, and the cowled Fryer;\r\n    Whereof, examples, (but a few years since)\r\n    Were shew’n the Norways, and Polonian Prince.”\r\n\r\nWas the strange fish that Stow speaks of in his _Annales_ one of these\r\ntwo?--“A.D. 1187. Neere unto Orforde in Suffolke, certaine Fishers of\r\nthe sea tooke in their Nettes, a Fish having the shape of a man in all\r\npointes, which Fish was kept by _Bartlemew de Glanville_, Custos of the\r\ncastle of Orforde, in the same Castle, by the space of sixe monethes,\r\nand more, for a wonder: He spake not a word. All manner of meates he\r\ngladly did eate, but more greedilie raw fishe, after he had crusshed out\r\nall the moisture. Oftentimes he was brought to the Church where he\r\nshowed no tokens of adoration. At length, when he was not well looked\r\nto, he stale away to the Sea and never after appeared.” If this was not\r\nthe real Simon Pure, yet I think it may put in a claim as a first-class\r\nBritish production, and, as far as I know, unique--all other denizens of\r\nthe deep having some trace of their watery habitat, either in wearing\r\nscales, or a tail.\r\n\r\nFollowing Du Bartas’ idea, let us take some marine animals which have a\r\nsomewhat similar counterpart on shore.\r\n\r\nGesner gives us the picture, Olaus Magnus gives us the veracious\r\nhistory, of the Sea-cow:--“The Sea Cow is a huge Monster, strong, angry,\r\nand injurious; she brings forth a young one like to herself; yet not\r\nabove two, but one often, which she loves very much, and leads it about\r\ncarefully with her, whithersoever she swims to Sea, or goes on Land.\r\nLastly this Creature is known to have lived 130 years, by cutting off\r\nher tail.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus calls the Seal, the Sea-calf; and with trifling exceptions,\r\ngives a fair account of its habits, only there are some points which\r\ndiffer from the modern Seal, at all events:--“The Sea-Calf, which also\r\nin Latine is called _Helcus_, hath its name from the likeness of a\r\nLand-Calf, and it hath a hard fleshy body; and therefore it is hard to\r\nbe killed, but by breaking the Temples of the head. It hath a voice like\r\na Bull, four feet, but not his ears; because the manner and mansion of\r\nits life is in the Waters. Had it such ears, they would take in much\r\nWater, and hinder the swimming of it.... They will low in their sleep,\r\nthence they are called Calves. They will learn, and with their voyce and\r\ncountenance salute the company, with a confused murmuring; called by\r\ntheir names, they will answer, and no Creature sleeps more profoundly.\r\nThe Fins that serve them for to swim in the Sea, serve for legs on Land,\r\nand they go hobling up and down as lame people do. Their Skins, though\r\ntaken from their bodies, have always a sense of the Seas, and when the\r\nSea goes forth, they will stand up like Bristles. The right Fin hath a\r\nsoporiferous quality to make one sleep, if it be put under one’s head.\r\nThey that fear Thunder, think those Tabernacles best to live in, that\r\nare made of Sea-Calves Skins, because onely this Creature in the Sea, as\r\nan Eagle in the Ayr is safe and secure from the Stroke of Thunder.... If\r\nthe Sea be boisterous and rise, so doth the Sea Calfe’s hair: if the Sea\r\nbe calm, the hair is smooth; and thus you may know the state of the Sea\r\nin a dead Skin. The _Bothnick_ Marriners conjecture by their own\r\nCloaths, that are made of these Skins, whether the Sea shall be calm,\r\nand their voyage prosperous, or they shall be in danger of Shipwreck....\r\nThese Creatures are so bold, that when they hear it thunder, and they\r\nsee it clash and lighten, they are glad, and ascend upon the plain\r\nMountains, as Frogs rejoyce against Rain.”\r\n\r\nA very fine piece of casuistry is shown, in “the perplexity of those\r\nthat eat the flesh of _Sea-Calves_ in _Lent_,” and it seems to be\r\nfinally settled that, according to “the men of a more clear judgment,\r\nrejecting many Reasons, brought on both sides, do say, and prove, that\r\nwhen the Sea-Calf brings forth on the shore, if the Beast driven by the\r\nHunter, run into the Woods, men must forbear to eat of it in Lent, when\r\nflesh is forbidden; but if he run to the Waters, one may fairly eat\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\nGesner, in giving this delineation of a Sea-Horse, openly says that it\r\nis the Classical horse, as used by Neptunus; but Olaus Magnus declares\r\nthat “The Sea Horse, between _Britany_ and _Norway_, is oft seen to have\r\na head like a horse, and to neigh; but his feet and hoof are cloven\r\nlike to a Cow’s; and he feeds both on Land, and in the Sea. He is\r\nseldome taken, though he grow to be as big as an Ox. He hath a forked\r\nTail like a Fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE SEA-MOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Sea-Mouse makes a hole in the Earth, and lays her Eggs there, and\r\nthen covers them with Earth: on the 30th day she digs it open again, and\r\nbrings her young to the Sea, first blind, and, afterwards, he comes to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE SEA-HARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Sea-Hare is found to be of divers kinds in the Ocean, but so soon\r\nas he is caught, onely because he is suspected to be Venemous, how like\r\nso ever he is to a Hare, he is let loose again. He hath four Fins behind\r\nhis Head, two whose motion is all the length of the fish, and they are\r\nlong, like to a Hare’s ears, and two again, whose motion is from the\r\nback, to the depth of the fishes belly, wherewith he raiseth up the\r\nweight of his head. This Hare is formidable in the Sea; on the Land he\r\nis found to be as timorous and fearful as a hare.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA-PIG.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAgain we are indebted to Gesner for the drawing of this Sea Monster.\r\nOlaus Magnus, speaking of “The Monstrous Hog of the _German Ocean_,”\r\nsays:--“I spake before of a Monstrous Fish found on the Shores of\r\n_England_, with a clear description of his whole body, and every member\r\nthereof, which was seen there in the year 1532, and the Inhabitants made\r\na Prey of it. Now I shall revive the memory of that Monstrous Hog that\r\nwas found afterwards, _Anno_ 1537, in the same _German Ocean_, and it\r\nwas a Monster in every part of it. For it had a Hog’s head, and a\r\nquarter of a Circle, like the Moon, in the hinder part of its head, four\r\nfeet like a Dragon’s, two eyes on both sides in his Loyns, and a third\r\nin his belly, inclining towards his Navel; behind he had a forked Tail,\r\nlike to other Fish commonly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WALRUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf the Walrus, Rosmarus, or Morse, Gesner draws, and Olaus Magnus\r\nwrites, thus:--“The _Norway_ Coast, toward the more Northern parts,\r\nhath a great Fish, as big as Elephants, which are called _Morsi_, or\r\n_Rosmari_, may be they are (called) so from their sharp biting; for, if\r\nthey see any man on the Sea-shore, and can catch him, they come suddenly\r\nupon him, and rend him with their Teeth, that they will kill him in a\r\ntrice. Therefore these Fish called _Rosmari_, or _Morsi_, have heads\r\nfashioned like to an Oxes, and a hairy Skin, and hair growing as thick\r\nas straw or corn-reeds, that lye loose very largely. They will raise\r\nthemselves with their Teeth, as by Ladders to the very tops of Rocks,\r\nthat they may feed on the Dewie Grasse, or Fresh Water, and role\r\nthemselves in it, unless in the mean time they fall very fast asleep,\r\nand rest upon the Rocks; for then Fishermen make all the haste they can,\r\nand begin at the Tail, and part the Skin from the Fat; and unto this\r\nthat is parted, they put most strong Cords, and fasten them on the\r\nrugged rocks or Trees, that are near; then they throw stones at his\r\nhead, out of a Sling, to raise him, and they compel him to descend,\r\nspoiled of the greatest part of his Skin, which is fastned to the Ropes:\r\nhe being thereby debilitated, fearful, and half dead, he is made a rich\r\nprey, especially for his Teeth, that are very pretious amongst the\r\n_Scythians_, the _Muscovites_, _Russians_, and Tartars, (as Ivory\r\namongst the Indians,) by reason of its hardness, whiteness, and\r\nponderousnesse. For which Cause, by excellent industry of Artificers\r\nthey are made fit for handles for Javelins: And this is also testified\r\nby _Mechovita_, an historian of _Poland_, in his double _Sarmatia_, and\r\n_Paulus Jovius_ after him, relates it by the Relation of one\r\n_Demetrius_, that was sent from the great Duke of _Muscovy_ to Pope\r\nClement the 7th.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Olaus Magnus is very circumstantial in his detail as to the\r\nintense somnolence, and brutal flaying alive of the “thereby\r\ndebilitated” Walrus, I can find no confirmation of either, in any other\r\naccount--on the contrary, in “A Briefe Note of the Morse and the use\r\nthereof,” published in Hakluyt, it is described as very wakeful and\r\nvigilant, and certainly not an animal likely to have salt put on its\r\ntail after Magnus’s manner:--\r\n\r\n“In the voyage of Jacques Carthier, wherein he discovered the Gulfe of\r\nS. Laurance, and the said Isle of Ramea in the yeere 1534, he met with\r\nthese beastes, as he witnesseth in these words: About the said island\r\nare very great beasts as great as oxen, which have two great teeth in\r\ntheir mouthes like unto elephant’s teeth, and live in the Sea. Wee sawe\r\none of them sleeping upon the banks of the water, and, thinking to take\r\nit, we went to it with our boates, but so soon as he heard us, he cast\r\nhimselfe into the sea. Touching these beasts which Jacques Carthier\r\nsaith to be as big as oxen, and to have teeth in their mouthes like\r\nelephants teeth; true it is that they are called in Latine _Boves\r\nmarini_ or _Vaccæ marinæ_, and in the Russian tongue morsses, the hides\r\nwhereof I have seene as big as any ox hide, and being dressed, I have\r\nyet a piece of one thicker than any two oxe, or bul’s hides in England.\r\n\r\n“The leather dressers take them to be excellent good to make light\r\ntargets against the arrowes of the savages; and I hold them farre better\r\nthan the light leather targets which the Moores use in Barbarie against\r\narrowes and lances, whereof I have seene divers in her Majesties stately\r\narmourie in the Toure of London. The teeth of the sayd fishes, whereof I\r\nhave seene a dry flat full at once, are a foote and sometimes more in\r\nlength; and have been sold in England to the combe and knife makers at 8\r\ngroats and 3 shillings the pound weight, whereas the best ivory is solde\r\nfor halfe the money; the graine of the bone is somewhat more yellow than\r\nthe ivorie. One Mr. Alexander Woodson of Bristoll, my old friend, an\r\nexcellent mathematician and skilful phisitian, shewed me one of these\r\nbeasts teeth which were brought from the Isle of Ramea in the first\r\nprize, which was half a yard long, or very little lesse: and assured mee\r\nthat he had made tryall of it in ministering medicine to his patients,\r\nand had found it as sovereigne against poyson as any unicorne’s horne.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ZIPHIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Voracious Animal, whose size may be imagined by comparison with the\r\nSeal it is devouring, is thus described by Magnus:--“Because this Beast\r\nis conversant in the Northern Waters, it is deservedly to be joined with\r\nother monstrous Creatures. The Swordfish is like no other, but in\r\nsomething it is like a Whale. He hath as ugly a head as an Owl: his\r\nmouth is wondrous deep, as a vast pit, whereby he terrifies and drives\r\naway those that look into it. His Eyes are horrible, his Back\r\nWedge-fashion, or elevated like a Sword; his snout is pointed. These\r\noften enter upon the Northern Coasts as Thieves and hurtful Guests, that\r\nare always doing mischief to ships they meet, by boring holes in them,\r\nand sinking them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE SAW FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Saw fish is also a beast of the Sea; the body is huge great, the\r\nhead hath a crest, and is hard and dented like to a Saw. It will swim\r\nunder ships and cut them, that the Water may come in, and he may feed on\r\nthe men when the ship is drowned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORCA\r\n\r\n\r\nis probably the Thresher whale. Pliny thus describes it:--“The Balæna\r\n(_whale of some sort_) penetrates to our seas even. It is said that they\r\nare not to be seen in the ocean of Gades (_Bay of Cadiz_) before the\r\nwinter solstice, and that at periodical seasons they retire and conceal\r\nthemselves in some calm capacious bay, in which they take a delight in\r\nbringing forth. This fact, however, is known to the Orca, an animal\r\nwhich is particularly hostile to the Balæna, and the form of which\r\ncannot be in any way accurately described, but as an enormous mass of\r\nflesh, armed with teeth. This animal attacks the Balæna in its place of\r\nretirement, and with its teeth tears its young, or else attacks the\r\nfemales which have just brought forth, and, indeed, while they are still\r\npregnant; and, as they rush upon them, it pierces them just as though\r\nthey had been attacked by the beak of a Liburnian Galley. The female\r\nBalænæ, devoid of all flexibility, without energy to defend themselves,\r\nand overburdened by their own weight; weakened, too, by gestation, or\r\nelse the pains of recent parturition, are well aware that their only\r\nresource is to take flight in the open sea, and to range over the whole\r\nface of the ocean; while the Orcæ, on the other hand, do all in their\r\npower to meet them in their flight, throw themselves in their way, and\r\nkill them either cooped up in a narrow passage, or else drive them on a\r\nshoal, or dash them to pieces against the rocks. When these battles are\r\nwitnessed, it appears just as though the sea were infuriate against\r\nitself; not a breath of wind is there to be felt in the bay, and yet the\r\nwaves, by their pantings and their repeated blows, are heaved aloft in a\r\nway which no whirlwind could effect.\r\n\r\n“An Orca has been seen even in the port of Ostia, where it was attacked\r\nby the Emperor Claudius. It was while he was constructing the harbour\r\nthere that this orca came, attracted by some hides, which, having been\r\nbrought from Gaul, had happened to fall overboard there. By feeding\r\nupon these for several days it had quite glutted itself, having made for\r\nitself a channel in the shoaly water. Here, however, the sand was thrown\r\nup by the action of the wind to such an extent that the creature found\r\nit quite impossible to turn round; and while in the act of pursuing its\r\nprey, it was propelled by the waves towards the shore, so that its back\r\ncame to be perceived above the level of the water, very much resembling\r\nin appearance the keel of a vessel turned bottom upwards. Upon this,\r\nCæsar ordered a number of nets to be extended at the mouth of the\r\nharbour, from shore to shore, while he himself went there with the\r\nPrætorian Cohorts, and so afforded a spectacle to the Roman people; for\r\nboats assailed the monster, while the soldiers on board showered lances\r\nupon it. I, myself, saw one of the boats sunk by the water which the\r\nanimal, as it respired, showered down upon it.”\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus thus writes “Of the fight between the Whale and the Orca. A\r\n_Whale_ is a very great fish, about one hundred, or three hundred foot\r\nlong, and the body is of a vast magnitude, yet the _Orca_, which is\r\nsmaller in quantity, but more nimble to assault, and cruel to come on,\r\nis his deadly Enemy. An Orca is like a Hull turned inwards outward; a\r\nBeast with fierce Teeth, with which, as with the Stern of a Ship, he\r\nrends the _Whale’s_ Guts, and tears its Calve’s body open, or he quickly\r\nruns and drives him up and down with his prickly back, that he makes him\r\nrun to Fords and Shores. But the _Whale_, that cannot turn its huge\r\nbody, not knowing how to resist the wily _Orca_, puts all its hopes in\r\nflight; yet that flight is weak, because this sluggish Beast, burdned by\r\nits own weight, wants one to guide her, to fly to the Foords, to escape\r\nthe dangers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOLPHIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPliny says:--“The Dolphin is an animal not only friendly to man, but a\r\nlover of music as well; he is charmed by melodious concerts, and more\r\nespecially by the notes of the water organ. He does not dread man, as\r\nthough a stranger to him, but comes to meet ships, leaps and bounds to\r\nand fro, vies with them in swiftness, and passes them even when in full\r\nsail.\r\n\r\n“In the reign of the late Emperor Augustus, a dolphin which had been\r\ncarried to the Lucrine Lake, conceived a most wonderful affection for\r\nthe child of a certain poor man, who was in the habit of going that way\r\nfrom Baiæ to Puteoli to school, and who used to stop there in the middle\r\nof the day, call him by his name of _Simo_, and would often entice him\r\nto the banks of the lake with pieces of bread which he carried for the\r\npurpose. At whatever hour of the day he might happen to be called by the\r\nboy, and although hidden and out of sight at the bottom of the water, he\r\nwould instantly fly to the surface, and after feeding from his hand,\r\nwould present his back for him to mount, taking care to conceal the\r\nspiny projection of his fins in their sheath, as it were; and so,\r\nsportively taking him up on his back, he would carry him over a wide\r\nexpanse of sea to the school at Puteoli, and in a similar manner bring\r\nhim back again. This happened for several years, until, at last, the boy\r\nhappened to fall ill of some malady, and died. The Dolphin, however,\r\nstill came to the same spot as usual, with a sorrowful air, and\r\nmanifesting every sign of deep affliction, until at last, a thing of\r\nwhich no one felt the slightest doubt, he died purely of sorrow and\r\nregret.\r\n\r\n“Within these few years also, another at Hippo Diarrhytus, on the coast\r\nof Africa, in a similar manner used to receive his food from the hands\r\nof various persons, present himself for their caresses, sport about\r\namong the swimmers, and carry them on his back. On being rubbed with\r\nunguents by Flavianus, the then pro-consul of Africa, he was lulled to\r\nsleep, as it appeared, by the sensation of an odour so new to him, and\r\nfloated about just as though he had been dead. For some months after\r\nthis, he carefully avoided all intercourse with man, just as if he had\r\nreceived some affront or other; but, at the end of that time, he\r\nreturned, and afforded just the same wonderful scenes as before. At\r\nlast, the vexations that were caused them by having to entertain so many\r\ninfluential men who came to see this sight, compelled the people of\r\nHippo to put the animal to death....\r\n\r\n“Hegesidemus has also informed us, that, in the city of Iasus (_the\r\nisland and city of Caria_), there was another boy also, Hermias by name,\r\nwho in a similar manner used to traverse the sea on a dolphin’s back,\r\nbut that, on one occasion, a tempest suddenly arising, he lost his life,\r\nand was brought back dead: upon which, the dolphin, who thus admitted\r\nthat he had been the cause of his death, would not return to the sea,\r\nbut lay down upon dry land and there expired.”\r\n\r\nDu Bartas gives us a new trait in the Dolphin’s character:--\r\n\r\n    “Even as the Dolphins do themselves expose,\r\n    For their live fellows, and beneath the waves\r\n    Cover their dead ones under sandy graves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NARWHAL,\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerally called the Monoceros or Sea Unicorn, is thus shown in one\r\nplace, by Gesner; and, rough though it is, it is far more like the\r\nNarwhal’s horn than is the other, also, in his work, of a Sea Rhinoceros\r\nor Narwhal engaged in combat with an outrageous-sized Lobster, or\r\nKraken, I know not which; for, as we shall presently see, the Kraken is\r\nrepresented as a Crayfish or Lobster. It was the long twisted horn of\r\nthe Narwhal which did duty for ages as the horn of the fabled Unicorn, a\r\ngift worthy to be presented by an Emperor to an Emperor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis sketch of Gesner’s, he describes as a one-horned monster with a\r\nsharp nose, devouring a Gambarus. Olaus Magnus dismisses the Narwhal\r\nvery curtly:--“The Unicorn is a Sea Beast, having in his forehead a\r\nvery great Horn, wherewith he can penetrate, and destroy the ships in\r\nhis way, and drown multitudes of men. But divine goodnesse hath provided\r\nfor the safety of Marriners herein; for, though he be a very fierce\r\nCreature, yet is he very slow, that such as fear his coming may fly from\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe earlier voyagers who really saw the Narwhal, fairly accurately\r\ndescribed it; as Baffin, whose name is so familiar to us by the bay\r\ncalled after him:--“As for the Sea Unicorne, it being a great fish,\r\nhaving a long horn or bone growing forth of his forehead or nostrill,\r\nsuch as Sir Martin Frobisher, in his second voyage found one, in divers\r\nplaces we saw them, which, if the horne be of any good value, no doubt\r\nbut many of them may be killed;” and Frobisher, as reported in Hakluyt,\r\nsays:--“On this west shore we found a dead fish floating, which had in\r\nhis nose a horne streight, and torquet, (_twisted_) of length two yards\r\nlacking two ynches. Being broken in the top, here we might perceive it\r\nhollow, into the which some of our sailors, putting spiders, they\r\npresently died. I saw not the triall hereof, but it was reported unto me\r\nof a truth; by the vertue thereof we supposed it to be the Sea\r\nUnicorne.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWAMFISCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration, though heading the chapter in Olaus\r\nMagnus regarding the Swamfisck and other fish, does not at all seem to\r\nelucidate the text:--“The Variety of these Fish, or rather Monsters, is\r\nhere set down, because of their admirable form, and many properties of\r\nNature, as they often come to the _Norway_ Shores amongst other\r\nCreatures, and they are catcht for their Fat, which they have in great\r\nplenty and abundance. For the Fisher-men purge it, by boyling it like\r\nflesh, on the fire, and they sell it to anoint leather, or for Oyl to\r\nburn in Lamps, to continue light, when it is perpetual darkness.\r\nWherefore the first Monster that comes, is of a round form, in _Norway_\r\ncalled _Swamfisck_, the greatest glutton of all other Sea-Monsters. For\r\nhe is scarce satisfied, though he eat continually. He is said to have no\r\ndistinct stomach; and so what he eats turns into the thickness of his\r\nbody, that he appears nothing else than one Lump of Conjoyned Fat. He\r\ndilates and extends himself beyond measure, and when he can be extended\r\nno more, he easily casts out fishes by his mouth because he wants a neck\r\nas other fishes do. His mouth and belly are continued one to the other.\r\nBut this Creature is so thick, that when there is danger, he can, (like\r\nthe Hedg-Hog) re-double his flesh, fat and skin, and contract and cover\r\nhimself; nor doth he that but to his own loss, because fearing Beasts\r\nthat are his Enemies, he will not open himself when he is oppressed\r\nwith hunger, but lives by feeding on his own flesh, choosing rather to\r\nbe consumed in part by himself, than to be totally devoured by Wild\r\nBeasts. If the danger be past, he will try to save himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE SAHAB.\r\n\r\n\r\n“There is also another Sea-Monster, called _Sahab_, which hath small\r\nfeet in respect of its great body, but he hath one long one, which he\r\nuseth in place of a hand to defend all his parts; and with that he puts\r\nmeat into his mouth, and digs up grass. His feet are almost gristly, and\r\nmade like the feet of a Cow or Calf. This Creature swimming in the\r\nwater, breathes, and when he sends forth his breath, it returns into the\r\nAyr, and he casts Water aloft, as Dolphins and Whales do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE CIRCHOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“There is also another Monster like to that, called _Circhos_, which\r\nhath a crusty and soft Skin, partly black, partly red, and hath two\r\ncloven places in his Foot, that serve for to make three Toes. The right\r\nfoot of this Animal is very small, but the left is great and long; and,\r\ntherefore, when he walks all his body leans on the left side, and he\r\ndraws his right foot after him: When the Ayr is calm he walketh, but\r\nwhen the Wind is high, and the Sky cloudy, he applies himself to the\r\nRocks, and rests unmoved, and sticks fast, that he can scarce be pulled\r\noff. The nature of this is wonderful enough: which in calm Weather is\r\nsound, and in stormy Weather is sick.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Northern Naturalists did not enjoy the monopoly of curious fish,\r\nfor Zahn gives us a very graphic picture of the different sides of two\r\nsmall fish captured in Denmark and Norway (_i.e._, presumably in some\r\nnorthern region) with curious letters marked on them. He does not\r\nattempt to elucidate the writing; and as it is of no known language, we\r\nmay charitably put it down to the original “Volapük.” He also favours us\r\nwith the effigies of a curious fish found in Silesia in 1609, also\r\nornamented with an inscription in an unknown tongue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe also supplies us with the portrait of a pike, which was daintily\r\nmarked with a cross on its side and a star on its forehead.\r\n\r\nBut too much space would be taken up if I were to recount all the\r\npiscine marvels that he relates.\r\n\r\nAristotle mentions that fish do not thrive in cold weather, and he says\r\nthat those which have a stone in their head, as the chromis, labrax,\r\nsciæna, and phagrus, suffer most in the winter; for the refrigeration of\r\nthe stone causes them to freeze, and be driven on shore.\r\n\r\nSir John Mandeville, speaking of the kingdom of Talonach, says:--“And\r\nthat land hath a marvayle that is in no other land, for all maner of\r\nfyshes of the sea cometh there once a yeare, one after the other, and\r\nlyeth him neere the lande, sometime on the lande, and so lye three\r\ndayes, and men of that lande come thither and take of them what he will,\r\nand then goe these fyshes awaye, and another sort commeth, and lyeth\r\nalso three dayes and men take of them, and do thus all maner of fyshes\r\ntyll all have been there, and menne have taken what they wyll. And men\r\nwot not the cause why it is so. But they of that Countrey saye, that\r\nthose fyshes come so thyther to do worship to theyr king, for they say\r\nhe is the most worthiest king of the worlde, for he hath so many wives,\r\nand geateth so many children of them.” (See next page.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI know of no other fish of such an accomodating nature, except it be\r\nthose of whom Ser Marco Polo speaks, when writing of Armenia:--“There is\r\nin this Country a certain Convent of Nuns called St. Leonard’s about\r\nwhich I have to tell you a very wonderful circumstance. Near the church\r\nin question there is a great lake at the foot of a mountain, and in this\r\nlake are found no fish, great or small, throughout the year till Lent\r\ncome. On the first day of Lent they find in it the finest fish in the\r\nworld, and great store, too, thereof; and these continue to be found\r\ntill Easter Eve. After that they are found no more till Lent come round\r\nagain; and so ’tis every year. ’Tis really a passing great miracle!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEdward Webbe, “Master Gunner,” whose travels were printed in 1590,\r\ninforms us that in the “Land of Siria there is a River having great\r\nstore of fish like unto Samon-trouts, but no Jew can catch them, though\r\neither Christian and Turk shall catch them in abundance, with great\r\nease.”\r\n\r\nPliny has some curious natural phenomena to tell us about, of showers of\r\nMilk, Blood, Flesh, Iron, and Wool; nay, he even says that, the year of\r\nthis woolly shower, when Titus Annius Milo was pleading his own cause,\r\nthere fell a shower of baked tiles!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter this we can swallow Olaus Magnus’s story of a rain of fishes very\r\ncomfortably, especially as he supplements it with showers of frogs and\r\nworms.\r\n\r\nHe gives a curious story of the black river at the New Fort in\r\nFinland:--“There is a Fort in the utmost parts of _Finland_ that is\r\nunder the Pole, and it belongs to the Kingdom of _Sweden_, and it is\r\ncalled the New-Fort, because it was wonderfull cunningly built, and\r\nfortified by Nature and Art; for it is placed on a round Mountain,\r\nhaving but one entrance and outlet toward the West; and that by a ship\r\nthat is tyed with great Iron Chains, which by strong labour and benefit\r\nof Wheels, by reason of the force of the Waters, is drawn to one part\r\nof the River by night, by keepers appointed by the King of _Sweden_, or\r\nsuch as farm it. A vast river runs by this Castle, whose depth cannot be\r\nfound; it ariseth from the White Lake, and falls down by degrees: at the\r\nbottome it is black, especially round this Castle, where it breeds and\r\nholds none but black Fish, but of no ill taste, as are Salmons, Trouts,\r\nPerch, Pikes, and other soft Fish. It produceth also the Fish _Trebius_,\r\nthat is black in Summer, and white in Winter, who, as _Albertus_ saith,\r\ngrows lean in the Sea; but when he is a foot long, he is five fingers\r\nfat: This, seasoned with Salt, will draw Gold out of the deepest waters\r\nthat it is fallen in, and make it flote from the bottome. At last, it\r\nmakes the black Lake passing by _Viburgum_, as _Nilus_ makes a black\r\nRiver, where he dischargeth himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“When the Image of a Harper, playing, as it were, upon his Harp, in the\r\nmiddle of the Waters above them appears, it signifies some ill _Omen_,\r\nthat the Governor of the Fort, or Captain shall suddenly be slain, or\r\nthat the negligent and sleepy Watchman shall be thrown headlong from\r\nthe high walls, and die by Martial Law. Also this water is never free\r\nfrom Ghosts and Visions that appear at all times; and a man may hear\r\nPipes sound, and Cymbals tinkle, to the shore.”\r\n\r\nAristotle mentions a fish called the Meryx that chewed the cud, and\r\nPliny speaks of the Scarus, which, he says, “at the present day is the\r\nonly fish that is said to ruminate, and feed on grass, and not on other\r\nfish.” But he seems to have forgotten that in a previous place in the\r\nsame book, he speaks of a large peninsula in the Red Sea, on the\r\nsouthern coast of Arabia, called Cadara, where “the sea monsters, just\r\nlike so many cattle, were in the habit of coming on shore, and after\r\nfeeding on the roots of shrubs, they would return; some of them, which\r\nhad the heads of horses, asses, and bulls, found a pasture in the crops\r\nof grain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REMORA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this fish Pliny writes:--“There is a very small fish that is in the\r\nhabit of living among the rocks, and is known as the Echeneis, Ἀπὸ τοῦ\r\nἔχειν νῆας. (_From holding back ships._) It is believed that when this\r\nhas attached itself to the keel of a ship, its progress is impeded, and\r\nthat it is from this circumstance that it takes its name. For this\r\nreason, also, it has a disgraceful repute, as being employed in love\r\nphiltres, and for the purpose of retarding judgments and legal\r\nproceedings.... It is never used, however, for food.... Mucianus speaks\r\nof a Murex of larger size than the purple, with a head that is neither\r\nrough nor round; and the shell of which is single, and falls in folds on\r\neither side. He tells us, also, that some of these creatures once\r\nattached themselves to a ship freighted with children of noble birth,\r\nwho were being sent by Periander for the purpose of being castrated, and\r\nthat they stopped its course in full sail; and he further says, that the\r\nshell-fish which did this service are duly honoured in the temple of\r\nVenus, at Cnidos. Trebius Niger says that this fish is a foot in length,\r\nand five fingers in thickness, and that it can retard the course of\r\nvessels; besides which, it has another peculiar property--when preserved\r\nin salt, and applied, it is able to draw up gold which has fallen into a\r\nwell, however deep it may happen to be.”\r\n\r\n    “But, _Clio_, wherefore art thou tedious\r\n    In numbering _Neptune’s_ busie burgers thus?\r\n    If in his works thou wilt admire the worth\r\n    Of the Sea’s Soverain, bring but only forth\r\n    One little _Fish_, whose admirable story\r\n    Sufficeth sole to shewe his might and glory.\r\n    Let all the Windes, in one Winde gather them,\r\n    And (seconded with _Neptune’s_ strongest stream)\r\n    Let all at once blowe all the stiffest gales\r\n    Astern a Galley under all her sails;\r\n    Let her be holpen with a hundred Owers,\r\n    Each lively handled by five lusty Rowers;\r\n    The _Remora_, fixing her feeble horn\r\n    Into the tempest beaten Vessel’s Stern,\r\n    Stayes her stone still, while all her stout Consorts\r\n    Saile thence, at pleasure, to their wished Ports,\r\n    Then loose they all the sheats, but to no boot:\r\n    For the charm’d Vessell bougeth not a foot;\r\n    No more than if, three fadom under ground,\r\n    A score of Anchors held her fastly bound:\r\n    No more than doth the Oak, that in the Wood,\r\n    Hath thousand Tempests, (thousand times) withstood;\r\n    Spreading as many massy roots belowe,\r\n    As mighty arms above the ground do growe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG-FISH AND RAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus writes of “The cruelty of some Fish, and the kindness of\r\nothers. There is a fish of the kind of Sea-Dogfish, called _Boloma_, in\r\n_Italian_, and in _Norway_, _Haafisck_, that will set upon a man\r\nswimming in the Salt-Waters, so greedily, in Troops, unawares, that he\r\nwill sink a man to the bottome, not only by his biting, but also by his\r\nweight; and he will eat his more tender parts, as his nostrils, fingers,\r\n&c., until such time as the Ray come to revenge these injuries; which\r\nruns thorow the Waters armed with her natural fins, and with some\r\nviolence drives away these fish that set upon the drown’d man, and doth\r\nwhat he can to urge him to swim out. And he also keeps the man, until\r\nsuch time as his spirit being quite gone; and after some days, as the\r\nSea naturally purgeth itself, he is cast up. This miserable spectacle is\r\nseen on the Coasts of _Norway_ when men go to wash themselves, namely,\r\nstrangers and Marriners that are ignorant of the dangers, leap out of\r\ntheir ships into the sea. For these Dogfish, or _Boloma_, lie hid under\r\nthe ships riding at Anchor as Water Rams, that they may catch men, their\r\nmalicious natures stirring them to it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA DRAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf the Ray tribe of fishes, the Sea Dragon is the most\r\nfrightful-looking, but we know next to nothing about it. Pliny only\r\ncursorily mentions it thus:--“The Sea Dragon again, if caught, and\r\nthrown on the sand, works out a hole for itself with its muzzle, with\r\nthe most wonderful celerity.” Olaus Magnus simply copies Pliny almost\r\nword for word. Gesner, from whom I have taken this illustration, merely\r\nclasses it among the Rays, and gives no further information about it;\r\nneither does Aldrovandus, from whom I have taken another picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STING RAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPliny mentions the Sting Ray, and ascribes to it marvellous powers,\r\nwhich it does not possess:--“There is nothing more to be dreaded than\r\nthe sting which protrudes from the tail of the _Trygon_, by our people\r\nknown as the _Pastinaca_, a weapon five inches in length. Fixing this in\r\nthe root of a tree, the fish is able to kill it; it can pierce armour,\r\ntoo, just as though with an arrow, and to the strength of iron it adds\r\nall the corrosive qualities of poison.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENSES OF FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also tells us about the senses of fishes, and first of their\r\nhearing:--“Among the marine animals, it is not probable that Oysters\r\nenjoy the sense of hearing, but it is said that immediately a noise is\r\nmade, the Solen (_razor-sheath_) will sink to the bottom; it is for this\r\nreason, too, that silence is observed by persons while fishing at sea.\r\nFishes have neither organs of hearing, nor yet the exterior orifice. And\r\nyet it is quite certain that they do hear, for it is a well-known fact,\r\nthat in some fish-ponds they are in the habit of being assembled to be\r\nfed by the clapping of the hands. In the fish-ponds, too, that belong to\r\nthe Emperor, the fish are in the habit of coming, each kind, as it hears\r\nits name. So, too, it is said the Mullet, the Wolf-fish, the Salpa, and\r\nthe Chromis, have a very exquisite sense of hearing, and that it is for\r\nthis reason that they frequent shallow water.\r\n\r\n“It is quite manifest that fishes have the sense of smell also; for they\r\nare not all to be taken with the same bait, and are seen to smell at it\r\nbefore they seize it. Some, too, that are concealed in the bottom of\r\nholes are driven out by the fishermen, by the aid of the smell of salted\r\nfish; with this he rubs the entrance of their retreat in the rock,\r\nimmediately upon which they take to flight from the spot, just as though\r\nthey had recognized the dead carcases of those of their kind. Then,\r\nagain, they will rise to the surface at the smell of certain odours,\r\nsuch, for instance, as roasted sepia and polypus; and hence it is that\r\nthese baits are placed in the osier-kipes used for taking fish. They\r\nimmediately take to flight upon smelling the bilge-water in a ship’s\r\nhold, and more especially upon scenting the blood of fish.\r\n\r\n“The Polypus cannot possibly be torn away from the rock to which it\r\nclings; but upon the herb _cunila_ being applied, the instant it smells\r\nit, the fish quits its hold.... All animals have the sense of touch,\r\nthose even which have no other sense; for even in the oyster, and, among\r\nland animals, in the worm, this sense is found. I am strongly inclined\r\nto believe, too, that the sense of taste exists in all animals; for why\r\nelse should one seek one kind of food, and one another?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZOOPHYTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting on the lower phases of Marine Animal life, he says:--“Indeed,\r\nfor my own part, I am strongly of opinion that there is sense existing\r\nin those bodies which have the nature of neither animals nor vegetables,\r\nbut a third, which partakes of them both:--sea-nettles, and sponges, I\r\nmean. The Sea Nettle wanders to and fro by night, and at night changes\r\nits locality. These creatures are by nature a sort of fleshy branch, and\r\nare nurtured upon flesh. They have the power of producing an itching,\r\nsmarting pain, just like that caused by the nettle found on land. For\r\nthe purpose of seeking its prey, it contracts, and stiffens itself to\r\nthe utmost possible extent, and then, as a small fish swims past, it\r\nwill suddenly spread out its branches, and so seize and devour it. At\r\nanother time it will assume the appearance of being quite withered away,\r\nand let itself be tossed to and fro, by the waves, like a piece of\r\nsea-weed, until it happens to touch a fish. The moment it does so, the\r\nfish goes to rub itself against a rock, to get rid of the itching:\r\nimmediately upon which, the nettle pounces upon it. By night also it is\r\non the look-out for Scallops and Sea-urchins. When it perceives a hand\r\napproaching it, it instantly changes its colour, and contracts itself;\r\nwhen touched, it produces a burning sensation, and if ever so short a\r\ntime is afforded, makes its escape. Its mouth is situate, it is said, at\r\nthe root or lower part, and the excrements are discharged by a small\r\ncanal situated above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SPONGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“We find three kinds of sponges mentioned; the first are thick, very\r\nhard, and rough, and are called _tragi_: the second are thick, and much\r\nsofter, and are called _mani_: of the third, being fine, and of a closer\r\ntexture, tents for sores are made; this last is known as _Achillium_.\r\nAll of these sponges grow on rocks, and feed upon shell and other fish,\r\nand slime.\r\n\r\n“It would appear that these creatures, too, have some intelligence; for,\r\nas soon as ever they feel the hand about to tear them off, they contract\r\nthemselves, and are separated with much greater difficulty: they do the\r\nsame also, when the waves buffet them to and fro. The small shells that\r\nare found in them, clearly show that they live upon food; about Torone\r\nit is even said that they will survive after they have been detached,\r\nand that they grow again from the roots which have been left adhering to\r\nthe rock. They leave a colour similar to that of blood upon the rock\r\nfrom which they have been detached, and those, more especially, which\r\nare produced in the Syrtes of Africa.”\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus gives us the accompanying illustration of Zoophytes and\r\nSponges. Of the latter, he says:--“Sponges are much multiplied near the\r\nCoasts of _Norway_; the nature of it is, that it agrees with other\r\nliving creatures in the way of contracting, and dilating itself: yet\r\nsome are immovable from rocks, and if they be broken off at the Roots,\r\nthey grow again; some are movable from place to place; and these are\r\nfound in huge plenty on the foresaid shores. They are fed with mud,\r\nsmall fish, and oysters. When they are alive, they are black, as they\r\nare when they are wet.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KRAKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis enormous monster, peculiar to the Northern Seas, is scarcely a\r\nfable, because huge Calamaries are not infrequently seen. Poor\r\nPontoppidan has often been considered a Danish Ananias, but there are\r\nauthentic accounts of these enormous Cuttle-fish; for instance, in 1854,\r\none was stranded at the Skag, in Jutland, which was cut in pieces by the\r\nfishermen in order to be used as bait, and filled many wheelbarrows.\r\nAnother, either in 1860 or 1861, was stranded between Hillswick and\r\nScalloway, on the west of Scotland, and its tentacles were sixteen feet\r\nlong, the pedal arms about half as long, and its body seven feet. The\r\nFrench ship _Alecton_, on 30th November 1861, between Madeira and\r\nTeneriffe, slipped a rope with a running knot over an enormous calamary,\r\nbut only brought a portion on board, the body breaking off. It was\r\nestimated at being sixteen to eighteen feet in length, without counting\r\nits arms. The legend of its sinking ships and taking sailors from them\r\nis common to many countries, even the Chinese and Japanese thus\r\ndepicting them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus gives us a graphic picture of a huge Polyp, thus seizing a\r\nsailor, and dragging him from his ship in spite of all his efforts to\r\nprevent him. On the next page is a huge calamary shown with a man in its\r\nclutches. This is both in Gesner and Aldrovandus. But this terror to\r\nmariners had its master in the Conger eel. Gesner, who has taken his\r\npicture from some description of the World, introduces it as a\r\nSea-Serpent; but Aristotle says that “the Congers devour the Polypi,\r\nwhich cannot adhere to them on account of the smoothness of their\r\nsurface.” Magnus also speaks of the antipathy between the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny, quoting Trebius Niger, the Polypus shows a fair\r\namount of cunning:--“Shell fish are destitute of sight, and, indeed, all\r\nother sensations but those which warn them of hunger, and the approach\r\nof danger. Hence it is that the Polypus lies in ambush till the fish\r\nopens its shell, immediately upon which, it places within it a small\r\npebble, taking care, at the same time, to keep it from touching the body\r\nof the animal, lest, by making some movement, it should chance to eject\r\nit. Having made itself thus secure, it attacks its prey, and draws out\r\nthe flesh, while the other tries to contract itself, but all in vain, in\r\nconsequence of the separation of the shell, thus effected by the\r\ninsertion of the wedge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“In addition to the above, the same author states that there is not an\r\nanimal in existence, that is more dangerous for its powers of destroying\r\na human being when in the water. Embracing his body, it counteracts his\r\nstruggles, and draws him under with its feelers and its numerous\r\nsuckers, when, as often is the case, it happens to make an attack upon\r\na shipwrecked mariner or a child. If, however, the animal is turned\r\nover, it loses all its power; for when it is thrown upon its back, the\r\narms open of themselves.\r\n\r\n“The other particulars which the same author has given, appear still\r\nmore closely to border upon the marvellous. At Carteia, in the preserves\r\nthere, a Polypus was in the habit of coming from the sea to the pickling\r\ntubs that were left open, and devouring the fish laid in salt there--for\r\nit is quite astonishing how eagerly all sea animals follow even the very\r\nsmell of salted condiments, so much so, that it is for this reason that\r\nthe fishermen take care to rub the inside of the wicker fish-kipes with\r\nthem.--At last, by its repeated thefts and immoderate depredations, it\r\ndrew down upon itself the wrath of the keepers of the works. Palisades\r\nwere placed before them, but these the Polypus managed to get over by\r\nthe aid of a tree, and was only caught at last by calling in the\r\nassistance of trained dogs, which surrounded it at night, as it was\r\nreturning with its prey; upon which, the keepers, awakened by the noise,\r\nwere struck with alarm at the novelty of the sight presented.\r\n\r\n“First of all, the size of the Polypus was enormous beyond all\r\nconception: and then it was covered all over with dried brine, and\r\nexhaled a most dreadful stench. Who could have expected to find a\r\nPolypus there, or could have recognised it as such, under these\r\ncircumstances? They really thought that they were joining battle with\r\nsome monster, for at one instant, it would drive off the dogs by its\r\nhorrible fumes, and lash at them with the extremities of its feelers;\r\nwhile at another, it would strike them with its stronger arms, giving\r\nblows with so many clubs, as it were; and it was only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that it could be dispatched with the aid of a considerable\r\nnumber of three-pronged fish-spears. The head of this animal was shewn\r\nto Lucullus; it was in size as large as a cask of fifteen amphoræ\r\n(_about 135 gallons_), and had a beard (_iti tentaculæ_), to use the\r\nexpression of Trebius himself, which could hardly be encircled with both\r\narms, full of knots, like those upon a club, and thirty feet in length;\r\nthe suckers, or calicules, as large as an urn, resembled a basin in\r\nshape, while the teeth again were of a corresponding largeness: its\r\nremains, which were carefully preserved as a curiosity, weighed seven\r\nhundred pounds.”\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus says:--“On the Coasts of _Norway_ there is a Polypus, or\r\ncreature with many feet, which hath a pipe on his back, whereby he puts\r\nto Sea, and he moves that sometimes to the right, and sometimes to the\r\nleft. Moreover, with his Legs as it were by hollow places, dispersed\r\nhere and there, and by his Toothed Nippers, he fastneth on every living\r\nCreature that comes near to him, that wants blood. Whatever he eats he\r\nheaps up in the holes where he resides: Then he casts out the Skins,\r\nhaving eaten the flesh, and hunts after fishes that swim to them: Also\r\nhe casts out the shels, and hard outsides of Crabs that remain. He\r\nchangeth his colour by the colour of the stone he sticks unto,\r\nespecially when he is frighted at the sight of his Enemy, the Conger. He\r\nhath 4 great middle feet, in all 8; a little body, which the great feet\r\nmake amends for. He hath also some small feet that are shadowed and can\r\nscarce be perceived. By these he sustains, moves, and defends himself,\r\nand takes hold of what is from him: and he lies on his back upon the\r\nstones, that he can scarce be gotten off, onlesse you put some stinking\r\nsmell to him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAYFISH AND CRABS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPliny tells us that in the Indian Ocean are Crayfish four cubits in\r\nlength (six feet), and he claims for crabs a sovereign specific against\r\nbites of scorpions and snakes:--“River-Crabs taken fresh and beaten up\r\nand drunk in water, or the ashes of them, kept for the purpose, are\r\nuseful in all cases of poisoning, as a counter poison; taken with asses’\r\nmilk they are particularly serviceable as a neutralizer of the venom of\r\nthe scorpion; goat’s milk or any other kind of milk being substituted,\r\nwhere asses’ milk cannot be procured. Wine, too, should also be used in\r\nall such cases. River-Crabs beaten up with Ocimum, and applied to\r\nScorpions, are fatal to them. They are possessed of similar virtues,\r\nalso, for the bites of all other kinds of venomous animals, the Scytale\r\nin particular, adders, the sea hare, and the bramble frog. The ashes of\r\nthem, preserved, are good for persons who give symptoms of hydrophobia\r\nafter being bitten by a mad dog, some adding gentian as well, and\r\nadministering the mixture in wine. In cases, too, where hydrophobia has\r\nalready appeared, it is recommended, that these ashes should be kneaded\r\nup into boluses with wine and swallowed. If ten of these crabs be tied\r\ntogether with a handful of Ocimum, all the scorpions in the\r\nneighbourhood, the magicians say, will be attracted to the spot. They\r\nrecommend, also, that to wounds inflicted by the scorpion, these crabs,\r\nor the ashes of them, should be applied with Ocimum. For all these\r\npurposes, however, sea crabs, it should be remembered, are not so\r\nuseful. Thrasyllus informs us that there is nothing so antagonistic to\r\nserpents as crabs: that swine, when stung by a serpent, cure themselves\r\nby eating them; and that, when the sun is in the sign of Cancer,\r\nserpents suffer the greatest tortures....\r\n\r\n“It is said that while the sun is passing through the sign of Cancer,\r\nthe dead bodies of the crabs, which are lying on the shore, are\r\ntransformed into serpents.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA-SERPENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the antiquity of the belief in the Sea-Serpent there can be no doubt,\r\nfor it is represented on the walls of the Assyrian palace at Khorsabad,\r\nmore than once, in the sculpture representing the voyage of Sargon to\r\nCyprus, thus giving it an authentic antiquity of over 2600 years: but as\r\nits existence must then have been a matter of belief, it naturally comes\r\nthat it must be much older than that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAristotle, who wrote nearly 400 years later, speaks of them, and their\r\nsavage disposition:--“In Libya, the serpents, as it has been already\r\nremarked, are very large. For some persons say that as they sailed along\r\nthe coast, they saw the bones of many oxen, and that it was evident to\r\nthem that they had been devoured by the serpents. And, as the ships\r\npassed on, the serpents attacked the triremes, and some of them threw\r\nthemselves upon one of the triremes, and overturned it.”\r\n\r\nThese, together with Sargon’s Sea-Serpent, were doubtless marine snakes,\r\nwhich are still in existence, and are found in the Indian Ocean, but the\r\nlarger ones seem to have been seen in more northern waters. It has been\r\nthe fashion to pooh-pooh the existence of this sea monster, but there\r\nare many that still do believe in it most thoroughly; only, to express\r\nthat belief would be to certainly expose oneself to ridicule. No one\r\ndoubts the _bonâ fides_ of those who narrate having seen them, but some\r\none is sure to come forward with his pet theory as to its being a school\r\nof porpoises, or an enormous cuttle-fish, with its tentacles playing on\r\nthe surface of the water; so that no one likes to confess that he has\r\nseen it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBoth Olaus Magnus and Gesner give illustrations of the Sea-Serpent of\r\nNorway, and I give that of the latter, as it is the best. The former\r\nsays:--“They who Work of Navigation, on the Coasts of _Norway_, employ\r\nthemselves in fishing, or merchandize, do all agree in this strange\r\nStory, that there is a Serpent there which is of a Vast Magnitude,\r\nnamely 200 feet long, and, moreover, 20 foot thick; and is wont to live\r\nin Rocks and Caves toward the Sea Coast about _Berge_; which will go\r\nalone from his holes in a clear night in Summer, and devour Calves,\r\nLambs, and Hogs, or else he goes into the Sea to feed on Polypus,\r\nLocusts, and all sorts of Sea Crabs. He hath commonly hair hanging from\r\nhis neck a cubit long, and sharp Scales, and is black, and he hath\r\nflaming shining eys. This Snake disquiets the Shippers, and he puts up\r\nhis head on high like a pillar, and catcheth away men, and he devours\r\nthem; and this hapneth not, but it signifies some wonderful change of\r\nthe Kingdom near at hand; namely, that the Princes shall die, or be\r\nbanished; or some Tumultuous Wars shall presently follow. There is also\r\nanother Serpent of an incredible magnitude in a town called _Moos_, of\r\nthe Diocess of _Hammer_; which, as a Comet portends a change in all the\r\nWorld, so, that portends a change in the Kingdom of _Norway_, as it was\r\nseen, _Anno_ 1522, that lifts himself high above the Waters, and rouls\r\nhimself round like a sphere. This Serpent was thought to be fifty Cubits\r\nlong by conjecture, by sight afar off: there followed this the\r\nbanishment of King _Christiernus_, and a great persecution of the\r\nBishops; and it shew’d also the destruction of the Country.”\r\n\r\nTopsell, in his _Historie of Serpents_, 1608, does not add much to\r\nSea-Serpent lore, but he adds the picture of another kind of Serpent, as\r\ndoes also Aldrovandus, whose illustration I give. (See p. 272.) Erik\r\nPontoppidan, Bishop of Bergen, in his _Natürlichen Historie von\r\nNorwegen_, gives a picture of the Sea-Serpent, somewhat similar to that\r\npreviously given by Hans Egede, “the Apostle of Greenland.” (See next\r\npage.) Pontoppidan tried to sift the wheat from the chaff, in connection\r\nwith the Natural History of the North, but he was not always successful.\r\nHe gives several cases, one seemingly very well authenticated, of the\r\nappearance of Sea-Serpents.\r\n\r\nBut possibly more credence may be given to more modern instances. Sir\r\nWalter Scott, in the Notes to _The Pirate_, says (speaking of Shetland\r\nand Orkney fishermen):--“The Sea-Snake was also known, which, arising\r\nout of the depths of the ocean, stretches to the skies his enormous\r\nneck, covered with a mane like that of a war-horse, and with his broad\r\nglittering eyes, raised mast-head high, looks out, as it seems, for\r\nplunder or for victims.” “The author knew a mariner, of some reputation\r\nin his class, vouch for having seen the celebrated Sea-Serpent. It\r\nappeared, as far as could be guessed, to be about a hundred feet long,\r\nwith the wild mane and fiery eyes which old writers ascribe to the\r\nmonster; but it is not unlikely the spectator might, in the doubtful\r\nlight, be deceived by a good Norway log on the water.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Maclean, the pastor of Eigg, an island in the Small Isles parish,\r\nInverness-shire, wrote, in 1809, to Dr. Neill, the Secretary of the\r\nWernerian Society, that he had seen a Sea-Serpent, while he was in a\r\nboat about two miles from land. The serpent followed the boat, and the\r\nminister escaped by getting on to a rock. He described it as having a\r\nlarge head and slender tail, with no fins, its body tapering to its\r\ntail. It moved in undulations, and he thought its length might be\r\nseventy to eighty feet. It was seen, also, by the crews of thirteen\r\nfishing-boats, who, being frightened thereat, fled to the nearest creek\r\nfor safety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA Sea-Serpent, judged to be of the length of about eighty feet, was seen\r\nby a party of British officers, in Margaret’s Bay, whilst crossing from\r\nHalifax to Mahone Bay, on 15th May 1833.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 a Sea-Serpent was seen frequently, in the neighbourhood of\r\nChristiansand and Molde, by many persons, and by one Lars Johnöen,\r\nfisherman at Smolen, especially. He said that one afternoon, in the\r\ndog-days, when sitting in his boat, he saw it twice in the course of two\r\nhours, and quite close to him. It came, indeed, to within six feet of\r\nhim, and, becoming alarmed, he commended his soul to God, and lay down\r\nin the boat, only holding his head high enough to enable him to observe\r\nthe monster. It passed him, disappeared, and returned; but a breeze\r\nspringing up, it sank, and he saw it no more. He described it as being\r\nabout six fathoms (thirty-six _feet_) long, the body (which was as round\r\nas a serpent’s) two feet across, the head as long as a ten-gallon cask,\r\nthe eyes round, red, sparkling, and about five inches in diameter; close\r\nbehind the head, a mane, like a fin, commenced along the neck, and\r\nspread itself out on both sides, right and left, when swimming. The\r\nmane, as well as the head, was of the colour of mahogany. The body was\r\nquite smooth, its movements occasionally fast and slow. It was\r\nserpent-like, and moved up and down. The few undulations which those\r\nparts of the body and tail that were out of water made, were scarce a\r\nfathom in length. His account was confirmed by several people of\r\nposition, a Surgeon, a Rector, and a Curate, being among those who had\r\nseen a Sea-Serpent.\r\n\r\nBut an appearance of the Sea-Serpent, without doubt, is most\r\nsatisfactorily attested by the captain and officers of H.M.S. _Dædalus_.\r\nThe first notice of it was in the _Times_ of 10th October 1848, in which\r\nwas a paragraph, dated 7th October, from Plymouth:--\r\n\r\n“When the _Dædalus_ frigate, Captain M‘Quhæ, which arrived here on the\r\n4th inst., was on her passage home from the East Indies, between the\r\nCape of Good Hope and St. Helena, her captain, and most of her officers\r\nand crew, at four o’clock one afternoon, saw a Sea-Serpent. The creature\r\nwas twenty minutes in sight of the frigate, and passed under her\r\nquarter. Its head appeared about four feet out of the water, and there\r\nwas about sixty feet of its body in a straight line on the surface. It\r\nis calculated that there must have been under water a length of thirty\r\nor forty feet more, by which it propelled itself at the rate of fifteen\r\nmiles an hour. The diameter of the exposed part of the body was about\r\nsixteen inches; and when it extended its jaws, which were full of large\r\njagged teeth, they seemed sufficiently capacious to admit of a tall man\r\nstanding upright between them. The ship was sailing north at the rate of\r\neight miles an hour. The _Dædalus_ left the Cape of Good Hope on the\r\n30th of July, and reached St. Helena on the 16th of August.”\r\n\r\nCaptain M‘Quhæ sent the following letter to Admiral Sir W. H. Gage,\r\nG.C.H., at Devonport:--\r\n\r\n    “HER MAJESTY’S SHIP _DÆDALUS_, HAMOAZE,\r\n    _Oct. 11, 1848_.\r\n\r\n    “SIR,--In reply to your letter of this day’s date, requiring\r\n    information as to the truth of a statement published in the Times\r\n    newspaper, of a Sea-Serpent of extraordinary dimensions having been\r\n    seen from Her Majesty’s Ship _Dædalus_, under my command, on her\r\n    passage from the East Indies, I have the honour to acquaint you, for\r\n    the information of my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that at\r\n    five o’clock P.M., on the 6th of August last, in latitude 24° 44′ S.\r\n    and longitude 9° 22′ E., the weather dark and cloudy, wind fresh\r\n    from the N.W., with a long ocean swell from the S.W., the ship on\r\n    the port tack heading N.E. by N., something very unusual was seen by\r\n    Mr. Sartoris, midshipman, rapidly approaching the ship from before\r\n    the beam. The circumstance was immediately reported by him to the\r\n    officer of the watch, Lieutenant Edgar Drummond, with whom, and Mr.\r\n    William Barrett, the master, I was at the time walking the\r\n    quarter-deck. The ship’s company were at supper.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    “On our attention being called to the object, it was discovered to\r\n    be an enormous Serpent, with head and shoulders kept about four feet\r\n    constantly above the surface of the sea; and, as nearly as we could\r\n    approximate by comparing it with the length of what our\r\n    maintopsail-yard would show in the water, there was, at the very\r\n    least, sixty feet of the animal _à fleur d’eau_, no portion of which\r\n    was, to our perception, used in propelling it through the water,\r\n    either by vertical or horizontal undulation. It passed rapidly, but\r\n    so close under our lee quarter that, had it been a man of my\r\n    acquaintance, I should have easily recognised his features with the\r\n    naked eye; and it did not, either in approaching the ship or after\r\n    it had passed our wake, deviate in the slightest degree from its\r\n    course to the S.W., which it held on at the pace of from twelve to\r\n    fifteen miles per hour, apparently on some determined purpose.\r\n\r\n    “The diameter of the Serpent was about fifteen or sixteen inches\r\n    behind the head, which was, without any doubt, that of a snake; and\r\n    it was never, during the twenty minutes that it continued in sight\r\n    of our glasses, once below the surface of the water. Its colour, a\r\n    dark brown, with yellowish white about the throat. It had no fins,\r\n    but something like the mane of a horse, or rather a bunch of\r\n    seaweed, washed about its back. It was seen by the quartermaster,\r\n    the boatswain’s mate, and the man at the wheel, in addition to\r\n    myself and officers above mentioned.\r\n\r\n    “I am having a drawing of the Serpent made from a sketch taken\r\n    immediately after it was seen, which I hope to have ready for\r\n    transmission to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty by\r\n    to-morrow’s post.--I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n    PETER M‘QUHÆ, CAPTAIN.”\r\n\r\nSpace will not allow me to chronicle all the other appearances of\r\nSea-Serpents from 1848 to the present time. Suffice it to say, they are\r\nnot very uncommon, and as for veracity, I will give another instance of\r\nits being seen on board the Royal Yacht _Osborne_, on 2nd June 1877, off\r\nCape Vito, Sicily. Lieutenant Haynes made sketches, and wrote a\r\ndescription, of it, which was confirmed by the Captain and several\r\nofficers. He wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “ROYAL YACHT _OSBORNE_, GIBRALTAR,\r\n    _June 6, 1877_.\r\n\r\n    “On the evening of that day (June 2), the sea being perfectly\r\n    smooth, my attention was first called by seeing a ridge of fins\r\n    above the surface of the water extending about thirty feet, and\r\n    varying from five to six feet in height. On inspecting it by means\r\n    of a telescope, at about one and a half cable’s distance, I\r\n    distinctly saw a head, two flappers, and about thirty feet of an\r\n    animal’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n    “The head, as nearly as I could judge, was about six feet thick, the\r\n    neck narrower, about four or five feet, the shoulder about fifteen\r\n    feet across, and the flappers each about fifteen feet in length. The\r\n    movements of the flappers were those of a turtle, and the animal\r\n    resembled a huge seal, the resemblance being strongest about the\r\n    back of the head. I could not see the length of the head, but from\r\n    its crown or top to just below the shoulder (where it became\r\n    immersed) I should reckon about fifty feet. The tail end I did not\r\n    see, being under water, unless the ridge of fins to which my\r\n    attention was first attracted, and which had disappeared by the time\r\n    I got a telescope, were really the continuation of the shoulder to\r\n    the end of the object’s body. The animal’s head was not always above\r\n    water, but was thrown upwards, remaining above for a few seconds at\r\n    a time, and then disappearing. There was an entire absence of\r\n    ‘blowing’ or ‘spouting.’”\r\n\r\nI think the verdict may be given that its existence, although belonging\r\nto “Curious Zoology,” is not impossible, and can hardly be branded as a\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERPENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Serpents Topsell has written a “Historie,” which, if not altogether\r\nveracious, is very amusing; and I shall quote largely from it, as it\r\nshows us “the latest thing out” in Serpents as believed in, and taught,\r\nin the time of James I. He begins, of course, with their creation, and\r\nthe Biblical mention of them, and then passes to the power of man over\r\nthem in charming and taming them. Of the former he tells the following\r\ntale:--\r\n\r\n“_Aloisius Cadamustus_, in his description of the New World, telleth an\r\nexcellent hystorie of a _Lygurian_ young Man, beeing among the _Negroes_\r\ntravailing in _Affrick_, whereby he endeavoureth to proove, how ordinary\r\nand familiar it is to them, to take and charme Serpents.\r\n\r\n“The young man beeing in _Affricke_ among the _Negroes_, and lodged in\r\nthe house of a Nephew to the Prince of _Budoniell_, when he was taking\r\nhimselfe to his rest, suddenly awakened by hearing the unwonted noise of\r\nthe hissing of innumerable sorts of Serpents; wherat he wondred, and\r\nbeeing in some terror, he heard his Host (the Prince’s Nephew) to make\r\nhimselfe readie to go out of the doores, (for he had called up his\r\nservants to sadle up his Cammels:) the young man demaunded of him the\r\ncause, why he would go out of doores now so late in the darke night? to\r\nwhom he answered, I am to goe a little way, but I will returne againe\r\nverie speedily; and so he went, and with a charme quieted the Serpents,\r\nand drove them all away, returning againe with greater speed than the\r\n_Lygurian_ young man, his ghest, expected. And when he had returned, he\r\nasked his ghest if hee did not heare the inmoderate hyssing of the\r\nSerpents? and he answered, that he had heard them to his great terrour.\r\nThen the Prince’s Nephew (who was called Bisboror) replyed, saying, they\r\nwere Serpents which had beset the house, and would have destroyed all\r\ntheir Cattell and Heards, except hee had gone foorth to drive them away\r\nby a Charme, which was very common and ordinary in those parts, wherin\r\nwere abundance of very hurtfull Serpents.\r\n\r\n“The Lygurian young man, hearing him say so, marvailed above measure,\r\nand said, that this thing was so rare and miraculous, that scarcely\r\nChristians could beleeve it. The _Negro_ thought it as strange that the\r\nyoung man should bee ignorant heereof, and therefore told him, that\r\ntheir Prince could worke more strange things by a Charme which he had,\r\nand that this, and such like, were small, vulgar, and not be counted\r\nmiraculous. For, when he is to use any strong poyson upon present\r\nnecessitie, to put any man to death, he putteth some venom uppon a\r\nsword, or other peece of Armour, and then making a large round Circle,\r\nby his Charme compelleth many Serpents to come within that circle, hee\r\nhimselfe standing amongst them, and observing the most venomous of them\r\nall so assembled, which he thinketh to contain the strongest poyson,\r\nkilleth him, and causeth the residue to depart away presentlie; then,\r\nout of the dead Serpent hee taketh the poyson, and mixeth it with the\r\nseede of a certaine vulgar Tree, and therewithall annoynteth his dart,\r\narrow, or sword’s point, whereby is caused present death, if it give the\r\nbodie of a man but a very small wound, even to the breaking of the\r\nskinne, or drawing of the blood. And the saide _Negro_ did earnestly\r\nperswade the young man to see an experiment hereof, promising him to\r\nshew all as he had related, but the _Lygurian_ beeing more willing to\r\nheare such things told, than bolde to attempt the triall, told him that\r\nhe was not willing to see any such experiment.\r\n\r\n“And by this it appeareth, that all the _Negroes_ are addicted to\r\nIncantations, which never have anie approbation from God, except against\r\nSerpents, which I cannot very easilie be brought to beleeve.”\r\n\r\nOf the affection of some serpents for the human-kind he gives some\r\nexamples:--“We reade also in Plutarch of certain Serpents, lovers of\r\nyoung virgins, and by name there was one that was in love with one\r\n_Ætolia_, a Virgin, who did accustome to come unto her in the night\r\ntime, slyding gentlie all over her bodie, never harming her, but as one\r\nglad of such acquaintance, tarried with her in that dalliance till the\r\nmorning, and them would depart away of his owne accorde: the which thing\r\nbeeing made manifest unto the Guardians and Tutours of the Virgin, they\r\nremoved her unto another Towne. The Serpent missing his Love, sought her\r\nuppe and downe three or four dayes, and at last mette her by chance, and\r\nthen hee saluted her not as he was wont, with fawning, and gentle\r\nslyding, but fiercely assaulted her with grimme and austere countenance,\r\nflying to her hands, and binding them with the spire of his bodie, fast\r\nto her sides, did softly with his tayle beat her upon her backer parts.\r\nWhereby was collected, some token of his chastisement unto her, who had\r\nwronged such a Lover, with her wilfull absence and disappointment.\r\n\r\n“It is also reported by _Ælianus_ that _Egemon_ in his verses, writeth\r\nof one _Alena_, a _Thessalian_ who, feeding his Oxen in _Thessaly_,\r\nneere the Fountaine _Hæmonius_, there fell in love with him a Serpent of\r\nexceeding bignesse and quantitie, and the same would come unto him, and\r\nsoftly licke his face and golden haire, without dooing him any manner of\r\nhurt at all.”\r\n\r\nHe tells a few more “Snake stories,” and quotes from “a little Latine\r\nbooke printed at _Vienna_, in the yeare of the Lorde 1551,” the\r\nfollowing:--“There was (sayth mine Author) found in a mowe or rycke of\r\ncorne, almost as many Snakes, Adders, and other Serpentes, as there were\r\nsheafes, so as no one sheafe could be removed, but there presently\r\nappeared a heape of ougly and fierce Serpents. The countrey men\r\ndetermined to set fire upon the Barne, and so attempted to doe, but in\r\nvaine, for the straw would take no fire, although they laboured with all\r\ntheir wit and pollicye, to burne them up; At last, there appeared unto\r\nthem at the top of the heap a huge great Serpent, which, lifting up his\r\nhead, spake with man’s voyce to the countrey men, saying: _Cease to\r\nprosecute your devise, for you shall not be able to accomplish our\r\nburning, for wee were not bredde by Nature, neither came we hither of\r\nour own accord, but were sent by God to take vengeance on the sinnes of\r\nmen._”\r\n\r\nAnd some serpents were “very fine and large,” for he says:--“_Gellius_\r\nwriteth, that when the Romanes were in the Carthaginian Warre, and\r\n_Attilius Regulus_ the Consull had pitched his Tents neere unto the\r\nriver _Bragrada_, there was a Serpent of monstrous quantitie, which had\r\nbeene lodged within the compasse of the Tents, and therefore did cause\r\nto the whole Armie exceeding great calamitie, untill by casting of\r\nstones with slings, and many other devises, they oppressed and slew that\r\nSerpent, and afterward fleyed off the skinne and sent it to _Rome_;\r\nwhich was in length one hundred and twentie feete.\r\n\r\n“And, although this seemeth to be a beast of unmatchable stature, yet\r\n_Postdenius_ a Christian writer, relateth a storie of another which was\r\nmuch greater, for hee writeth that he saw a Serpent dead, of the length\r\nof an acre of Land, and all the residue both of head and bodie, were\r\nanswerable in proportion, for the bulke of his bodie was so great, and\r\nlay so high, that two Horsemen could not see one the other, beeing at\r\nhis two sides, and the widenes of his mouth was so great, that he could\r\nreceive at one time, within the compasse thereof, a horse and a man on\r\nhis backe both together: The scales of his coate or skinne, being every\r\none like a large buckler or target. So that now, there is no such cause\r\nto wonder at the Serpent which is said to be killed by _St. George_,\r\nwhich was, as is reported, so great, that eight Oxen were but strength\r\nenough to drawe him out of the Cittie _Silena_....\r\n\r\n“Among the _Scyritæ_, the Serpents come by great swarmes uppon their\r\nflocks of sheepe and cattell, and some they eate up all, others they\r\nkill, and sucke out the blood, and some part they carry away. But if\r\never there were anything beyond credite, it is the relation of\r\n_Volateran_ in his twelfth booke of the _New-found Lands_, wherein he\r\nwriteth, that there are Serpents of a mile long, which at one certaine\r\ntime of the yeere come abroad out of the holes and dennes of habitation,\r\nand destroy both the Heards and Heard-men if they find them. Much more\r\nfavourable are the Serpents of a _Spanish_ Island, who doe no harme to\r\nany living thing, although they have huge bodies, and great strength to\r\naccomplish their desires.”\r\n\r\nAfter this it will be refreshing to have one of Topsell’s own particular\r\n_true stories_: and this is “Of a true history done in _England_, in\r\nthe house of a worshipfull Gentleman, upon a servant of his, whom I\r\ncould name if it were needfull. He had a servant that grew very lame and\r\nfeeble in his legges, and thinking that he could never be warme in his\r\nbed, did multiply his clothes, and covered himselfe more and more, but\r\nall in vaine, till at length he was not able to goe about, neither could\r\nany skill of Phisitian or Surgeon find out the cause.\r\n\r\n“It hapned on a day as his Maister leaned at his Parlour window, he saw\r\na great Snake to slide along the house side, and to creepe into the\r\nchamber of this lame man, then lying in his bedde, (as I remember,) for\r\nhee lay in a lowe chamber, directly against the Parlour window\r\naforesaid. The Gentleman desirous to see the issue, and what the Snake\r\nwould doe in the chamber, followed, and looked into the chamber by the\r\nwindow; where hee espied the snake to slide uppe into the bed-straw, by\r\nsome way open in the bottome of the bedde, which was of old bordes.\r\nStraightway, his hart rising thereat, he called two or three of his\r\nservaunts, and told them what he had seene, bidding them goe take their\r\nRapiers, and kill the said snake. The serving-men came first, and\r\nremoved the lame man (as I remember) and then the one of them turned up\r\nthe bed, and the other two the straw, their Maister standing without, at\r\nthe hole, whereinto the said snake had entered into the chamber. The\r\nbedde was no sooner turned up, and the Rapier thrust into the straw, but\r\nthere issued forth five or six great snakes that were lodged therein:\r\nThen the serving-men bestirring themselves, soone dispatched them, and\r\ncast them out of doores dead. Afterward, the lame man’s legges\r\nrecovered, and became as strong as ever they were; whereby did\r\nevidentlie appeare, the coldnes of these snakes or Serpents, which came\r\nclose to his legges everie night, did so benumme them, as he could not\r\ngoe.”\r\n\r\nYet one more:--\r\n\r\n“I cannot conceale a most memorable historie as ever was any in the\r\nworld, of a fight betwixt the Serpents of the Land and the Water. This\r\nhistory is taken out of a Booke of _Schilt-bergerus_, a _Bavarian_, who\r\nknew the same, (as he writeth) while hee was a captive in _Turky_; his\r\nwords are these. In the kingdome called _Genyke_, there is a Citty\r\ncalled _Sampson_, about which, while I was prisoner with _Baiazeta_ King\r\nof _Turkes_, there pitched or arrived, an innumerable company of Land\r\nand Water Serpents, compassing the said Cittie, a mile about. The Land\r\nSerpents came out of the woods of _Trienick_, which are great and many,\r\nand the Water Serpents came out of the bordering Sea. These were nine\r\ndayes together assembling in that place, and for feare of them there was\r\nnot any man that durst goe out of the Citty, although it was not\r\nobserved that they hurt any man, or living creature there-abouts.\r\n\r\n“Wherefore the Prince also commanded, that no man should trouble them,\r\nor doe them any harme, wisely judging, that such an accident came not\r\nbut by Divine Miracle, and that also to signifie some notable event.\r\nUppon the tenth day, these two valiant troupes joyned battell, early in\r\nthe morning, before the sunne-rising, so continuing in fight untill the\r\nsunne-set, at which time the Prince, with some horsemen, went out of the\r\nCittie to see the battell, and it appeared to him and his associates,\r\nthat the Water Serpents gave place to the Land Serpents. So the Prince,\r\nand his company, returned into the Citty againe, and the next day went\r\nforth againe, but found not a Serpent alive, for there were slaine above\r\neyght thousand: all which, he caused presently to be covered with earth\r\nin ditches, and afterwards declared the whole matter to _Baiazeta_ by\r\nletters, after he had gotten that Cittie, whereat the great Turke\r\nrejoyced, for hee thereby interpreted happinesse to himselfe.”\r\n\r\nLuckily, man has found out things inimical to Serpents, and they, and\r\ntheir use, seem to be very simple:--\r\n\r\n“There is such vertue in the Ashe tree, that no Serpent will endure to\r\ncome neere either the morning or evening shadow of it; yea, though very\r\nfarre distant from them, they do so deadlie hate it. We set downe\r\nnothing but that wee have found true by experience: If a great fire be\r\nmade, and the same fire encircled round with Ashen-boughes, and a\r\nserpent put betwixt the fire and the Ashen-boughes, the Serpent will\r\nsooner runne into the fire, than come neere the Ashen-boughes: thus\r\nsaith _Pliny_. _Olaus Magnus_ saith, that those Northern Countries which\r\nhave great store of Ash-trees, doe want venemous beasts, of which\r\nopinion is also _Pliny_. _Callimachus_ saith, there is a Tree growing in\r\nthe Land of _Trachinia_, called _Smilo_, to which, if any Serpents doe\r\neither come neere, or touch, they foorthwith die. _Democritus_ is of\r\nopinion, that any Serpent will die if you cast Oken-leaves upon him.\r\n_Pliny_ is of opinion that _Alcibiadum_, which is a kind of wild\r\nBuglosse, is of the same use and qualitie; and further, being chewed, if\r\nit be spet upon any serpent, that it cannot possibly live. In time of\r\nthose solemne Feastes which the _Athenians_ dedicated to the Goddesse\r\n_Ceres_, their women did use to lay and strew their beddes, with the\r\nleaves of the Plant called _Agnos_, because serpents could not endure\r\nit, and because they imagined it kept them chast, Where-upon they\r\nthought the name was given it. The herbe called Rosemarie, is terrible\r\nto serpents.\r\n\r\n“The _Egyptians_ doe give it out, that _Polydamna_ the wife of _Thorris_\r\ntheir King, taking pittie upon _Helen_, caused her to be set on shore in\r\nthe Island of _Pharus_, and bestowed upon her an herbe (whereof there\r\nwas plenty) that was a great enemy to serpents: whereof the serpents\r\nhaving a feeling sence (as they say) and so readily knowne of them, they\r\nstraightwaies got them to their lurking holes in the earth; and _Helen_\r\nplanted this herbe, who, coming to the knowledge thereof, she perceived\r\nthat in his due time it bore a seede that was a great enemy to serpents,\r\nand thereupon was called _Helenium_, as they that are skilfull in Plants\r\naffirme; and it groweth plentifully in _Pharus_, which is a little Ile\r\nagainst the mouth of _Nylus_, joyned to _Alexandria_ by a bridge.\r\n\r\n“Rue, (called of some, Herbe of Grace) especially that which groweth in\r\n_Lybia_, is but a backe friend to Serpents, for it is most dry, and\r\ntherefore causing Serpents soon to faint, and loose their courage,\r\nbecause (as _Simocatus_ affirmeth) it induceth a kind of heavinesse or\r\ndrunkennesse in their head, with a vertiginie, or giddines through the\r\nexcesse of his drinesse, or immoderate sticcitie. Serpents cannot endure\r\nthe savour of Rue, and, therefore, a Wesill, when she is to fight with\r\nany serpent, eateth Rue, as a defensative against her enemie, as\r\n_Aristotle_, and _Pliny_ his Interpreter, are of opinion.\r\n\r\n“The Country people leaving their vessels of Milke abroade in the open\r\nfieldes, doe besmeare them round about with garlick, lest some venomous\r\nserpents should creepe into them, but the smell of garlick, as\r\n_Erasmus_ saith, driveth them away. No serpents were ever yet seene to\r\ntouch the herbe _Trifolie_, or Three-leaved-grasse, as _Ædonnus_ wold\r\nmake us believe. And _Cardan_ the Phisitian hath observed as much, that\r\nserpents, nor anything that is venemous will neither lodge, dwell, or\r\nlurk privily neere unto _Trifolie_, because that is their bane, as they\r\nare to other living creatures: and therefore it is sowne to very good\r\npurpose, and planted in very hot countries, where there is most store of\r\nsuch venomous creatures.\r\n\r\n“_Arnoldus Villanonanus_ saith that the herb called _Dracontea_ killeth\r\nserpents. And _Florentinus_ affirmeth that, if you plant Woormwood,\r\nMugwort, or Sothernwood about your dwelling, that no venomous serpents\r\nwill ever come neer, or dare enterprise to invade the same. No serpent\r\nis found in Vines, when they flourish, bearing flowers or blossoms, for\r\nthey abhor the smell, as _Aristotle_ saith. _Avicen_, an _Arabian_\r\nPhisitian, saith, that Capers doe kill worms in the guts, and likewise\r\nserpents. If you make a round circle with herbe Betonie, and therein\r\ninclude any serpents, they will kill themselves in the place, rather\r\nthan strive to get away. Galbanum killeth serpents only by touching, if\r\noyle and the herbe called Fenell-giant be mixt withall. There is a\r\nshrubbe called Therionarca, having a flower like a Rose, which maketh\r\nserpents heavy, dull and drousie, and so killeth them, as _Pliny_\r\naffirmeth.”\r\n\r\nThere are more plants inimical to serpents, but enough have been given\r\nto enable the reader, if he have faith in them, to defend himself; and\r\nit is comforting to think, that although the serpent is especially\r\nnoxious, when alive, he is marvellously useful, medicinally, when dead.\r\nEven now, in some country places, viper broth is used as a medicine;\r\nand, in the first half of the eighteenth century, its flesh, prepared in\r\nvarious ways, was thoroughly recognised in the Pharmacopœia. But\r\nTopsell, who gathered together all the wisdom of the ancients, gives so\r\nvery many remedies (for all kinds of illnesses) that may be derived from\r\ndifferent parts, and treatment, of serpents, that I can only pick out a\r\nfew:--\r\n\r\n“_Pliny_ saith, that if you take out the right eye of a serpent, and so\r\nbind it about any part of you, that it is of great force against the\r\nwatering or dropping of the eyes, by meanes of a rhume issuing out\r\nthereat, if the serpent be againe let goe alive. And so hee saith, that\r\na serpent’s or snake’s hart, if either it be bitten or tyed to any part\r\nof you, that it is a present remedie for the toothach: and hee addeth\r\nfurther, that if any man doe tast of the snake’s hart, that he shall\r\nnever after be hurt of any serpent.... The blood of a serpent is more\r\nprecious than _Balsamum_, and if you annoynt your lips with a little of\r\nit, they will looke passing redde: and, if the face be annoynted\r\ntherewith, it will receive no spot or fleck, but causeth it to have an\r\norient and beautiful hue. It represseth all scabbiness of the body,\r\nstinking in the teeth, and gummes, if they be therewith annointed. The\r\nfat of a serpent speedily helpeth all rednes, spots, and other\r\ninfirmities of the eyes, and beeing annoynted upon the eyeliddes, it\r\ncleereth the eyes exceedingly.\r\n\r\n“Item, put them (_serpents_) into a glassed pot, and fill the same with\r\nButter in the Month of May, then lute it well with paste (that is, Meal\r\nwell kneaded) so that nothing may evaporate, then sette the potte on the\r\nfire, and let it boyle wel-nigh halfe a day: after this is done,\r\nstraine the Butter through a cloth, and the remainder beate in a morter,\r\nand straine it againe, and mixe them together, then put them into water\r\nto coole, and so reserve it in silver or golden boxes, that which is not\r\nevaporated, for the older, the better it is, and so much the better it\r\nwill be, if you can keepe it fortie years. Let the sicke patient, who is\r\ntroubled eyther with the Goute, or the Palsie, but annoynt himselfe\r\noften against the fire with this unguent, and, without doubt, he shall\r\nbe freed, especially if it be the Goute.”\r\n\r\nOf serpents in general, I shall have little to say, except those few of\r\nwhich the descriptions are the most _outré_. And first let us have out\r\nthe “Boas,” which cannot mean that enormous serpent the Boa-Constrictor,\r\nwhich enfolds oxen, deer, &c., crushing their bones in its all-powerful\r\nfold, and which sometimes reaches the length of thirty or\r\nfive-and-thirty feet--long enough, in all conscience, for a respectable\r\nserpent. But Topsell begins his account of “The Boas” far more\r\nmagnificently:--\r\n\r\n“It was well knowne among all the Romans, that when _Regulus_ was\r\nGovernour, or Generall, in the _Punick_ warres, there was a Serpent\r\n(neere the river _Bagrade_) killed with slings and stones, even as a\r\nTowne or little Cittie is over-come, which Serpent was an hundred and\r\ntwenty foote in length; whose skinne and cheeke bones, were reserved in\r\na Temple at _Rome_, untill the _Numantine_ warre.\r\n\r\n“And this History is more easie to be beleeved, because of the Boas\r\nSerpent bred in Italy at this day: for we read in _Solinus_, that when\r\n_Claudius_ was Emperour, there was one of them slaine in the _Vatican_\r\nat Rome, in whose belly was found an Infant swallowed whole, and not a\r\nbone thereof broken....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Boas]\r\n\r\n“The Latines call it _Boa_, and _Bova_, because by sucking Cowe’s milke\r\nit so encreaseth, that in the end it destroyeth all manner of herdes,\r\nCattell, and Regions.... The Italians doe usually call them, _Serpeda de\r\nAqua_, a Serpent of the water, and, therefore, all the Learned expound\r\nthe Greeke word _Hydra_, for a Boas. _Cardan_ saith, that there are of\r\nthis kind in the Kingdom of _Senega_, both without feet and wings, but\r\nmost properly, as they are now found in Italy, according to these\r\nverses:\r\n\r\n    _Boa quidem serpens quem tellus Itala nutrit\r\n    Hunc bubulum plures lac enutrire docent._\r\n\r\nWhich may be englished thus:\r\n\r\n    _The Boas Serpent which Italy doth breede,\r\n    Men say, uppon the milke of Cowes doth feede._\r\n\r\n“Their fashion is in seeking for their prey among the heardes, to\r\ndestroy nothing that giveth suck, so long as it will live, but they\r\nreserve it alive untill the milk be dryed up, then afterwards they kill\r\nand eate it, and so they deale with whole flocks and heards.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhilst on the subject of Hydra, I give Topsell’s idea of the Lernean\r\nHydra, whose story is so familiar to us. (See p. 292.) But, after\r\npresenting us with such a frightful ideal, he says:--“And some ignorant\r\nmen of late daies at _Venice_, did picture this Hydra with wonderfull\r\nArt, and set it forth to the people to be seene, as though it had beene\r\na true carkase, with this inscription: In the yeare of Christe’s\r\nincarnation, 550, about the Month of January, ‘this monstrous Serpent\r\nwas brought out of _Turky_ to _Venice_, and afterwards given to the\r\nFrench King: It was esteemed to be worth 600 duckats. These monsters\r\nsignifie the mutation or change of worldly affaires,’ &c.” And, after\r\ngiving a long-winded inscription, _àpropos_ of nothing, he says:--“I\r\nhave also heard that in _Venice_ in the Duke’s treasury, among the rare\r\nMonuments of that Citty, there is preserved a Serpent with seaven heads,\r\nwhich, if it be true, it is the more probable that there is a Hydra, and\r\nthat the Poets were not altogether deceived, that say _Hercules_ killed\r\nsuch an one.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Lee, in his little book, “Sea Fables Explained,” says that the\r\nLernean Hydra was neither more nor less than a huge Octopus, and gives\r\nan illustration of a marble tablet in the Vatican (also given in\r\n“Smith’s Classical Dictionary”), which does not seem unlike one.\r\n\r\nThe Wingless Dragons belong to the serpent tribe, with the exception\r\nthat they are generally furnished with legs. These are “Wormes,” of\r\nseveral of which we, in England, were the happy possessors. Of course,\r\nin the northern parts of Europe, they survived (in story at all events)\r\nmuch later than with us, and Olaus Magnus gives accounts of several\r\nfights with them, notably that of Frotho and Fridlevus, two Champions,\r\nagainst a serpent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“_Frotho_, a Danish Champion and a King, scarce being past his\r\nchildhood, in a single combat killed a huge fierce great Serpent,\r\nthrusting his sword into his belly, for his hard skin would not be\r\nwounded, and all darts thrown at him, flew back again, and it was but\r\nlabour lost. _Fridlevus_ was no lesse valiant, who, both to try his\r\nvalour, and to find out some hidden treasure, set upon a most formidable\r\nSerpent for his huge body and venomous teeth, and, for a long time, he\r\ncast his darts against his scaly sides, and could not hurt him, for his\r\nhard body made nothing of the weapons cast with violence against him.\r\nBut this Serpent twisting his tail in many twines, by turning his tail\r\nround, he would pull up trees by the roots, and by his crawling on the\r\nground, he had made a great hollow place, that in some places, hills\r\nseemed to be parted as if a valley were between them, wherefore\r\n_Fridlevus_ considering that the upper parts of this beast could not be\r\npenetrated, he runs him in with his sword underneath; and, piercing into\r\nhis groine, he drew forth his virulent matter, as he lay panting: when\r\nhe had killed the Serpent, he dug up the money, and carried it away.”\r\n\r\nHe gives another story of a combat with “Wormes,” although in the Latin\r\nthey are called _Vipers_: yet I leave my readers to judge whether the\r\nsmall snake, the viper, would require such an amount of killing as\r\nRegner had to bestow upon them:--\r\n\r\n“Of _Regnerus_, called Hair-Coat. There was a King of the _Sueons_\r\ncalled _Herothus_, whose troubled mind was not a little urged how to\r\npreserve his Daughter’s chastity; whether he should guard her with wild\r\nbeasts (as the manner of most Princes was then) or else should commit\r\nthe custody of her to man’s fidelity. But he, preferring cruelty of\r\nBeasts to man’s fidelity, he soonest chose what would do most hurt. For,\r\nhunting in the woods, he brought some Snakes that his Company had found,\r\nfor his Daughter to feed up. She, quickly obeying her Father’s commands,\r\nbred up a generation of vipers by her Virgin hands. And that they might\r\nwant no meat, her curious Father caused the whole body of an Ox to be\r\nbrought, being ignorant that, by this private food, he maintain’d a\r\npublick destruction. These, being grown up, by their venomous breath\r\npoysoned the neighbouring parts; but the King, repenting his folly,\r\nproclaimed that he who could remove this plague, should have his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n“When _Regnerus_ of _Norway_, descended of the King’s race, who was the\r\nchief Suiter this Virgin had, heard this Report, he obtained from the\r\nNurse a woollen Cassock, and hairy Breeches, whereby he might hinder the\r\nbiting of the Adders. And when he came to _Sweden_ in a ship, he\r\npurposely suffered his Clothes to grow stiff with cold, casting water\r\nupon them: and thus clothed, having onely his Sword and Dart to defend\r\nhim, he went to the King. As he went forward, two huge Adders met him on\r\nthe way, that would kill the young man, with the twisting of their\r\ntails, and by the venome they cast forth.\r\n\r\n“But _Regnerus_ confiding in the hardness of his frozen Garments, both\r\nendured and repulsed their Venome, by his clothes, and their biting his\r\nHarness, being indefatigable in pressing hard upon these Wild Beasts.\r\nLast of all he strongly casts out of his hand his Javelin that was\r\nfastened with a Hoop, and struck it into their bodies. Then, with his\r\ntwo-edged Sword, rending both their hearts, he obtained a happy end of\r\nan ingenious and dangerous fight. The King, looking curiously on his\r\nclothes, when he saw them so hairy on the back-side, and unpolished like\r\nragged Frize, he spake merrily, and called him _Lodbrock_: that is _Hair\r\nCoat_; and to recreate him after his pains, he sent for him to a Banquet\r\nwith his friends. He answered, _That he must first go see those\r\nCompanions he had left_: and he brought them to the King’s Table, very\r\nbrave in clothes, as he was then: and lastly, when that was done, he\r\nreceived the pledge of his Victory, by whom he begat many hopeful\r\nChildren: and he had her true love to him the more, and the rather\r\nenjoyed his company, by how much she knew the great dangers he underwent\r\nto win her by, and the ingenious practises he used.”\r\n\r\nWe were favoured in England with several “Wormes.” Nor only in England,\r\nbut in Scotland and Wales. Of course, Ireland can boast of none, as St.\r\nPatrick banished all the serpents from that island.\r\n\r\nOf the Dragon of Wantley I say nothing; he has been reslain in modern\r\ntimes, and all the romance has gone out of him. Nobody wishes to know\r\nthat the Dragon was Sir Francis Wortley, who was at loggerheads with his\r\nneighbours, notably one Lionel Rowlestone, whose advocate was More of\r\nMore Hall. We had rather have had our dear old Dragon, and have let the\r\nchampion More slay him in the orthodox manner.\r\n\r\nBut the “laidley Worme” of Lambton is still all our own, and its story\r\nis thus told by Surtees in his “History, &c., of Durham,” 1820:--\r\n\r\n“The heir of Lambton, fishing, as was his profane custom, in the Wear,\r\non a Sunday, hooked a small worm or eft, which he carelessly threw into\r\na well, and thought no more of the adventure. The worm (at first\r\nneglected) grew till it was too large for its first habitation, and,\r\nissuing forth from the _Worm Well_, betook itself to the Wear, where it\r\nusually lay a part of the day coiled round a crag in the middle of the\r\nwater; it also frequented a green mound near the well (_the Worm Hill_),\r\nwhere it lapped itself nine times round, leaving vermicular traces, of\r\nwhich, grave living witnesses depose that they have seen the vestiges.\r\nIt now became the terror of the country, and, amongst other enormities,\r\nlevied a daily contribution of nine cows’ milk, which was always placed\r\nfor it at the green hill, and in default of which it devoured man and\r\nbeast. Young Lambton had, it seems, meanwhile, totally repented him of\r\nhis former life and conversation, had bathed himself in a bath of holy\r\nwater, taken the sign of the cross, and joined the Crusaders.\r\n\r\n“On his return home, he was extremely shocked at witnessing the effects\r\nof his youthful imprudences, and immediately undertook the adventure.\r\nAfter several fierce combats, in which the Crusader was foiled by his\r\nenemy’s _power of self-union_, he found it expedient to add policy to\r\ncourage, and not, perhaps, possessing much of the former quality, he\r\nwent to consult a witch or wise woman. By her judicious advice he armed\r\nhimself in a coat-of-mail studded with razor blades; and, thus prepared,\r\nplaced himself on the crag in the river, and awaited the monster’s\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n“At the usual time the worm came to the rock, and wound himself with\r\ngreat fury round the armed knight, who had the satisfaction to see his\r\nenemy cut in pieces by his own efforts, whilst the stream washing away\r\nthe severed parts, prevented the possibility of reunion.\r\n\r\n“There is still a sequel to the story: the witch had promised Lambton\r\nsuccess only on one condition, that he should slay the first living\r\nthing which met his sight after the victory. To avoid the possibility of\r\nhuman slaughter, Lambton had directed his father, that as soon as he\r\nheard him sound three blasts on his bugle, in token of the achievement\r\nperformed, he should release his favourite greyhound, which would\r\nimmediately fly to the sound of the horn, and was destined to be the\r\nsacrifice. On hearing his son’s bugle, however, the old chief was so\r\noverjoyed, that he forgot his instructions, and ran himself with open\r\narms to meet his son. Instead of committing a parricide, the conqueror\r\nagain repaired to his adviser, who pronounced, as the alternative of\r\ndisobeying the original instructions, that no chief of the Lambtons\r\nshould die in his bed for seven, (or as some accounts say) for nine\r\ngenerations--a commutation which, to a martial spirit, had nothing\r\nprobably very terrible, and which was willingly complied with....\r\n\r\n“In the garden-house at Lambton are two figures of no great antiquity. A\r\nKnight in good style, armed cap-a-pie, the back _studded with razor\r\nblades_, who holds the worm by one ear with his left hand, and with his\r\nright crams his sword to the hilt down his throat; and a Lady who wears\r\na coronet, with bare breasts, &c., in the style of Charles 2nd’s\r\nBeauties, a wound on whose bosom and an accidental mutilation of the\r\nhand are said to have been the work of the worm.”\r\n\r\nThere were several other English “Wormes,” but this must suffice as a\r\ntype. Also, as a typical Scotch “Worme,” the Linton Worme will serve. A\r\nwriter (W. E.) tells its story so well in _Notes and Queries_, February\r\n24, 1866, that I transfer it here, in preference to telling it myself.\r\nIt was slain by Sir John Somerville, about the year 1174, who received\r\nthe lands and barony of Linton, in Roxburghshire, as the reward of his\r\nexploit. W. E. quotes from a family history entitled a “Memorie of the\r\nSomervills,” written by James, the eleventh lord, A.D. 1679:--\r\n\r\n“‘In the parochene of Lintoune, within the sheriffdome of Roxburghe,\r\nther happened to breede ane hydeous monster, in the forme of a worme,\r\nsoe called and esteemed by the country people (but in effecte has beene\r\na serpente or some suche other creature), in length three Scots yards,\r\nand somewhat bigger than ane ordinarie man’s leg, &c.... This creature,\r\nbeing a terrour to the country people, had its den in a hollow piece of\r\nground, on the syde of a hill, south east from Lintoun Church, some more\r\nthan a myle, which unto this day is knowne by the name of the Worme’s\r\nglen, where it used to rest and shelter itself; but, when it sought\r\nafter prey, then would it wander a myle or two from its residence, and\r\nmake prey of all sort of bestiall that came in its way, which it easily\r\ndid because of its lownesse, creeping amongst the peat, heather, or\r\ngrasse, wherein that place abounded much, by reasone of the meadow\r\ngrounde, and a large flow moss, fit for the pasturage of many\r\ncattell.... Soe that the whole country men thereabout wer forced to\r\nremove ther bestiall and transport them 3 or 4 myles from the place,\r\nleaving the country desolate, neither durst any person goe to the\r\nChurch, or mercat, upon that rod, for fear of this beast.’\r\n\r\n“Somerville happening to come to Jedburgh, on the King’s business, found\r\nthe inhabitants full of stories about the wonderful beast.\r\n\r\n“‘The people who had fled ther for shelter, told soe many lies, as\r\nfirst, that it increased every day, and was beginning to get wings:\r\nothers pretended to have seen it in the night, and asserted it was full\r\nof fyre, and in tyme, would throw it out, &c., with a thousand other\r\nridiculous stories.’\r\n\r\n“Somerville determined to see the monster, and, accordingly, rode to the\r\nglen about sunrise, when he was told it generally came forth. He had not\r\nto wait long, till he perceived it crawl out of its den. When it\r\nobserved him, it raised itself up, and stared at him, for some time,\r\nwithout venturing to approach; whereupon he drew nearer to observe it\r\nmore closely, on which it turned round, and slunk into its lair.\r\n\r\n“Satisfied that the beast was not so dangerous as reported, he resolved\r\nto destroy it, but as every one declared that neither sword nor dagger\r\nhad any effect on it, and that its venom would destroy any one that came\r\nwithin its reach: he prepared a spear double the ordinary length, plated\r\nwith iron, four feet from the point, on which he placed a slender iron\r\nwheel, turning on its centre. On this he fastened a lighted peat, and\r\nexercised his horse with it for several days, until it shewed no fear or\r\ndislike to the fire and smoke. He then repaired to the den, and, on the\r\nworme appearing, his servant set fire to the peat, and, putting spurs to\r\nhis horse, he rode full at the beast. The speed at which he advanced,\r\ncaused the wheel to spin round, and fanned the peat into a blaze. He\r\ndrove the lance down the monster’s throat full a third part of its\r\nlength, when it broke, and he left the animal writhing in the agonies of\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nI am afraid the Welsh “Worme” is not so well authenticated as the\r\nothers; but the story is, that Denbigh is so named from a Dragon slain\r\nby John Salusbury of Lleweni, who died 1289. It devastated the country\r\nfar and wide, after the manner of its kind, and all the inhabitants\r\nprayed for the destruction of this _bych_. This the Champion effected,\r\nand in his glee, joyfully sang, _Dyn bych, Dyn bych_ (_No bych_); and\r\nthe country round was so named.\r\n\r\nThere arises the question, whether, having regard to the fact that the\r\nLambton worm, at all events, was amphibious, it might not have been a\r\nPlesiosaurus, which had survived some of its race, such as the\r\nillustration now given, of the one reconstructed by Thos. Hawkins, in\r\nhis “Book of the Great Sea Dragons.” We know that at some time or other\r\nthese animals existed, and, it may be, some few lingered on. At all\r\nevents most civilised nations have had a belief in it, and it was held\r\nto be the type of all that was wicked; so much so, that one of Satan’s\r\nsynonyms is “the Great Dragon.” In the Romances of Chivalry, its\r\ndestruction was always reserved for the worthiest knight; in classical\r\ntimes it was a terror. Both Hindoos and Chinese hold it in firm faith,\r\nand, take it all in all, belief in its entity was general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Winged Dragons were undoubtedly more furious and wicked than the\r\nWormes, and there is scarcely any reason to go farther than its\r\nportrait by Aldrovandus, to enable us to recognise it at any time. (See\r\nnext page.) Topsell gives another, but with scarcely so much detail.\r\n\r\nBut, although we in our times have not seen flying dragons in the flesh,\r\nwe have their fossilised bones in evidence of their existence. The\r\nPterodactyl, as Mr. Hawkins observes, “agrees with the Dragon in nearly\r\nall its more important features. Thus, it was of great size, possessed a\r\nlarge head, with long jaws and powerful teeth. It had wings of great\r\nspan, and at the same time three powerful clawed fingers to each hand,\r\nwings devoid of feathers, and capable of being folded along the sides of\r\nthe body, while the large size of the orbits may not, improbably, have\r\nsuggested the name dragon; for dragon, which is derived from the Greek\r\nδράκων, means, literally, _keen-sighted_.”\r\n\r\nWe now have flying lizards, both in India and the Malay Archipelago, in\r\nwhich latter is found a small lemur which can fly from tree to tree, and\r\nwe are all familiar with bats, some of which attain a large size.\r\n\r\nTopsell has exercised great research among old authorities respecting\r\ndragons, and he draws their portraits thus:--“_Gyllius_, _Pierius_, and\r\n_Grevinus_, following the authority of _Nicander_, do affirme that a\r\nDragon is of a blacke colour, the bellie somewhat green, and very\r\nbeautifull to behold, having a treble rowe of teeth in their mouthes\r\nupon every jawe, and with most bright and cleare seeing eyes, which\r\ncaused the Poets to faine in their writings, that these dragons are the\r\nwatchfull keepers of Treasures. They have also two dewlappes growing\r\nunder their chinne, and hanging downe like a beard, which are of a redde\r\ncolour; their bodies are set all over with very sharpe scales, and over\r\ntheir eyes stand certaine flexible eyeliddes. When they\r\ngape wide with their mouth, and thrust forth their tongue, theyr teeth\r\nseeme very much to resemble the teeth of Wilde Swine: And theyr neckes\r\nhave many times grosse thicke hayre growing upon them, much like unto\r\nthe bristles of a Wylde Boare.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nApart from looks, he does not give dragons, as a rule, a very bad\r\ncharacter, and says they do not attack men unless their general food\r\nfails them:--“They greatlie preserve their health (as _Aristotle_\r\naffirmeth) by eating of Wild lettice, for that they make them to vomit,\r\nand cast foorth of theyr stomacke what soever meate offendeth them, and\r\nthey are most speciallie offended by eating Apples, for theyr bodies are\r\nmuch subject to be filled with winde, and therefore they never eate\r\nApples, but first they eate Wilde lettice. Theyr sight also (as\r\n_Plutarch_ sayth) doth many times grow weake and feeble, and therefore\r\nthey renew and recover the same againe by rubbing their eyes against\r\nFennel, or else by eating it. Their age could never yet be certainely\r\nknowne, but it is conjectured that they live long, and in great health,\r\nlike all other serpents, and therefore they grow so great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Neither have wee in Europe onely heard of Dragons, and never seene\r\nthem, but also even in our own Country, there have (by the testimonie of\r\nsundry writers) divers been discovered and killed. And first of all,\r\nthere was a Dragon, or winged Serpent, brought unto _Francis_ the French\r\nKing, when hee lay at _Sancton_, by a certaine Country man, who had\r\nslaine the same Serpent himselfe with a Spade, when it sette upon him in\r\nthe fields to kill him. And this thinge was witnessed by many Learned\r\nand Credible men which saw the same; and they thought it was not bredde\r\nin that Country, but rather driven by the winde thither from some\r\nforraine Nation. For Fraunce was never knowne to breede any such\r\nMonsters. Among the _Pyrenes_, too, there is a cruell kinde of Serpent,\r\nnot past foure foot long, and as thicke as a man’s arme, out of whose\r\nsides growe winges, much like unto gristles.\r\n\r\n“_Gesner_ also saith, that in the yeere of our Lord 1543 there came many\r\nSerpents both with wings and legs into the parts of Germany neere\r\n_Stiria_, who did bite and wound many men incurably. _Cardan_ also\r\ndescribeth certaine serpents with wings, which he saw at Paris, whose\r\ndead bodies were in the hands of _Gulielmus Musicus_; hee saith that\r\nthey had two legges, and small winges, so that they could scarce flie,\r\nthe head was little, and like to the head of a serpent, their colour\r\nbright, and without haire or feathers, the quantitie of that which was\r\ngreatest, did not exceede the bignes of a Cony, and it is saide they\r\nwere brought out of India....\r\n\r\n“There have beene also Dragons many times seene in Germaine, flying in\r\nthe ayre at mid-day, and signifying great and fearefull fiers to follow,\r\nas it happened neere to the Cittie called _Niderburge_, neere to the\r\nshore of the _Rhyne_, in a marvailous cleere sun-shine day, there came a\r\ndragon three times successively together in one day, and did hang in the\r\nayre over a Towne called _Sanctogoarin_, and shaking his tayle over that\r\nTowne every time: it appeared visibly in the sight of many of the\r\ninhabitants, and, afterwards it came to passe, that the said towne was\r\nthree times burned with fire, to the great harme and undooing of the\r\npeople dwelling in the same; for they were not able to make any\r\nresistance to quench the fire, with all the might, Art, and power they\r\ncould raise. And it was further observed, that about the time there were\r\nmany dragons seene washing themselves in a certaine Fountaine or Well\r\nneere the towne, and if any of the people did by chance drinke of the\r\nwater of that Well, theyr bellyes did instantly begin to swell, and they\r\ndyed as if they had been poysoned. Whereupon it was publicly decreed,\r\nthat the said well should be filled up with stones, to the intent that\r\nnever any man should afterwards be poisoned with that water; and so a\r\nmemory thereof was continued, and these thinges are written by _Justinus\r\nGoblerus_, in an Epistle to _Gesner_, affirming that he did not write\r\nfayned things, but such things as were true, and as he had learned from\r\nmen of great honesty and credite, whose eyes did see and behold both the\r\ndragons, and the mishaps that followed by fire.”\r\n\r\nHitherto we have only seen that side of a Dragon’s temperament that is\r\ninimical to man, but there are stories, equally veracious, of their\r\naffection and love for men, women, and children: how they, by kindness,\r\nmay be tamed, and brought into kindly relations with the human species.\r\n\r\n_Pliny_, quoting _Democritus_, says that “a Man, called _Thoas_, was\r\npreserved in _Arcadia_ by a Dragon. When a boy he had become much\r\nattached to it, and had reared it very tenderly; but his father, being\r\nalarmed at the nature and monstrous size of the reptile, had taken and\r\nleft it in the desert. _Thoas_ being here attacked by some robbers, who\r\nlay in ambush, he was delivered from them by the Dragon, which\r\nrecognised his voice, and came to his assistance.”\r\n\r\nTopsell tells us that “there be some which by certaine inchaunting\r\nverses doe tame Dragons, and rydeth upon their neckes, as a man would\r\nride upon a horse, guiding and governing them with a bridle.”\r\n\r\nAnd so widely spread was the belief that these fearful animals could be\r\nbrought into subjection, that Magnus gives us an account “Of the Fight\r\nof King _Harald_ against a tame Dragon,” but this one seems hardly as\r\ndocile as those previously instanced:--“_Haraldus_ the most illustrious\r\nKing of _Norway_, residing, in his youth, with the King of\r\n_Constantinople_, and being condemned for man-slaughter, he was\r\ncommanded to be cast to a tame Dragon that should rend him in pieces. As\r\nhe went into the prison, one very faithfull servant he had, offered\r\nhimself freely to die with his Master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The keeper of the Castle, curiously observing them both, let them down\r\nat the mouth of the Den, being unarmed, and well searched; wherefore,\r\nwhen the servant was naked, he admitted _Harald_ to be covered with his\r\nshirt, for modesty’s sake, who gave him a braslet privily, and he\r\nscattered little fish on the pavement, that the Dragon might first stay\r\nhis hunger on them, and that the guilty persons that are shut up in the\r\ndark prison, might have a little light by the shining of the Fins and\r\nScales. Then _Haraldus_ picking up the bones of a Carkeis, stopt them\r\ninto the linen he had, and bound them fast together like a Club. And\r\nwhen the Dragon was let forth, and rushed greedily on his prey cast to\r\nhim, he lept quickly on his back, and he thrust a Barber’s razor in at\r\nhis navill, that would only be pierced by iron, which, as luck was, he\r\nbrought with him, and kept it concealed by him: this cold Serpent that\r\nhad most hard scales all over, disdained to be entred in any other part\r\nof his body. But _Haraldus_ sitting so high above him, could neither be\r\nbitten by his mouth, or hurt by his sharp teeth; or broken with the\r\nturnings of his tayle. And his servant using the weapons, or bones put\r\ntogether, beat the Dragon’s head till he bled, and died thereof by his\r\nmany weighty strokes. When the King knew this, he freely changed his\r\nrevenge, into his service, and pardoned these valiant persons, and\r\nfurnishing them with a Ship and Monies, he gave them leave to depart.”\r\n\r\nThe natural instinct of Dragons was undoubtedly vicious, and they must\r\nhave been most undesirable neighbours, _teste_ the following story\r\nquoted by Topsell from Stumpsius:--“When the Region of _Helvetia_\r\nbeganne first to be purged from noysome beasts, there was a horrible\r\ndragon found neere a Country towne called _Wilser_, who did destroy all\r\nmen and beastes, that came within his danger in the time of his hunger,\r\ninasmuch that that towne and the fields therto adjoyning, was called\r\n_Dedwiler_, that is, a Village of the Wildernes, for all the people and\r\ninhabitants had forsaken the same, and fledde to other places.\r\n\r\n“There was a man of that Towne whose name was _Winckleriedt_, who was\r\nbanished for manslaughter: this man promised, if he might have his\r\npardon, and be restored againe to his former inheritance, that he would\r\ncombat with that Dragon, and by God’s helpe destroy him; which thing was\r\ngranted unto him with great joyfulnes. Wherefore he was recalled home,\r\nand in the presence of many people went foorth to fight with that\r\nDragon, whom he slew and overcame, whereat for joy hee lifted uppe his\r\nsword imbrued in the dragon’s blood, in token of victory, but the blood\r\ndistilled downe from the sword uppon his body, and caused him instantly\r\nto fall downe dead.\r\n\r\n“There be certaine beasts called _Dracontopides_, very great and potent\r\nSerpents, whose faces are like to the faces of Virgins, and the residue\r\nof their body like to dragons. It is thought that such a one was the\r\nSerpent that deceived _Eve_, for _Beda_ saith it had a Virgin’s\r\ncountenance, and therefore the woman, seeing the likenes of her owne\r\nface, was the more easily drawne to believe it: into which the devill\r\nhad entred; they say he taught it to cover the body with leaves, and to\r\nshew nothing but the head and face. But this fable is not worthy to be\r\nrefuted, because the Scripture itself, dooth directly gaine-say everie\r\npart of it. For, first of all it is called a Serpent, and if it had been\r\na Dragon, _Moses_ would have said so; and, therefore, for ordinary\r\npunishment, GOD doth appoint it to creepe upon the belly, wherefore it\r\nis not likely that it had either wings or feete. Secondly, it was\r\nimpossible and unlikely, that any part of the body was covered or\r\nconceiled from the sight of the woman, seeing she knew it directly to be\r\na Serpent, as shee afterward confessed before GOD and her husband.\r\n\r\n“There be also certaine little dragons called in _Arabia_, _Vesga_, and\r\nin _Catalonia_, _Dragons of houses_; these, when they bite, leave their\r\nteeth behind them, so as the wound never ceaseth swelling, as long as\r\nthe teeth remain therein, and therefore, for the better cure thereof,\r\nthe teeth are drawne forth, and so the wound will soone be healed.\r\n\r\n“And thus much for the hatred betwixt men and dragons, now we will\r\nproceede to other creatures.\r\n\r\n“The greatest discord is between the Eagle and the Dragon, for the\r\nVultures, Eagles, Swannes and Dragons, are enemies to one another. The\r\nEagles, when they shake their winges, make the dragons afraide with\r\ntheir ratling noyse; then the dragon hideth himselfe within his den, so\r\nthat he never fighteth but in the ayre, eyther when the Eagle hath taken\r\naway his young ones, and he, to recover them, flieth aloft after her, or\r\nelse when the Eagle meeteth him in her nest, destroying her egges and\r\nyoung ones: for the Eagle devoureth the dragons, and little Serpents\r\nupon earth, and the dragons againe, and Serpents do the like against the\r\nEagles in the ayre. Yea, many times the dragon attempteth to take away\r\nthe prey out of the Eagle’s talants, both on the ground, and in the\r\nayre, so that there ariseth betwixt them a very hard and dangerous\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n“In the next place we are to consider the enmitie that is betwixt\r\nDragons and Elephants, for, so great is their hatred one to another,\r\nthat in Ethyopia the greatest dragons have no other name but Elephant\r\nkillers. Among the Indians, also, the same hatred remaineth, against\r\nwhom the dragons have many subtile inventions: for, besides the greate\r\nlength of their bodies, wherewithall they claspe and begirt the body of\r\nthe Elephant, continually byting of him, untill he fall downe dead, and\r\nin the which fall they are also bruzed to peeces; for the safeguard of\r\nthemselves, they have this device. They get and hide themselves in\r\ntrees, covering their head, and letting the other part hang downe like a\r\nrope: in those trees they watch untill the Elephant come to eate and\r\ncroppe of the branches; then, suddenly, before he be aware, they leape\r\ninto his face, and digge out his eyes, then doe they claspe themselves\r\nabout his necke, and with their tayles, or hinder parts, beate and vexe\r\nthe Elephant, untill they have made him breathlesse, for they strangle\r\nhim with theyr fore parts, as they beate them with the hinder, so that\r\nin this combat they both perrish: and this is the disposition of the\r\nDragon, that he never setteth upon the Elephant, but with the advantage\r\nof the place, and namely from some high tree or Rocke.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes againe, a multitude of dragons doe together observe the\r\npathes of the Elephants, and crosse those pathes they tie together their\r\ntailes as it were in knots, so that when the Elephant commeth along in\r\nthem, they insnare his legges, and suddainly leape uppe to his eyes, for\r\nthat is the part they ayme at above all other, which they speedily pull\r\nout, and so not being able to doe him any more harme, the poore beast\r\ndelivereth himselfe from present death by his owne strength, and yet\r\nthrough his blindnesse received in that combat, hee perrisheth by\r\nhunger, because he cannot choose his meate by smelling, but by his\r\neyesight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROCODILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest of the Saurians which we have left us, is the Crocodile; and\r\nit formerly had the character of being very deceitful, and, by its\r\nweeping, attracted its victims. Sir John Mandeville thus describes\r\nthem:--“In this land, and many other places of Inde, are many\r\ncocodrilles, that is a maner of a long serpent, and on nights they dwell\r\non water, and on dayes they dwell on land and rocks, and they eat not in\r\nwinter. These serpents sley men, and eate them weeping, and they have no\r\ntongue.”\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the Crocodile has a tongue, and a very large one too.\r\nAs to the fable of its weeping, do we not even to this day call sham\r\nmourning, “shedding crocodile’s tears?” Spenser, in his “Faerie Queene,”\r\nthus alludes to its supposed habits (B. I. c. 5. xviii.):--\r\n\r\n    “As when a wearie traveller, that strayes\r\n    By muddy shore of broad seven-mouthed Nile,\r\n    Unweeting of the perillous wandring wayes,\r\n    Doth meete a cruell craftie crocodile,\r\n    Which in false griefe hyding his harmeful guile,\r\n    Doth weepe full sore, and sheddeth tender tears:\r\n    The foolish man, that pities all this while\r\n    His mourneful plight, is swallowed up unawares,\r\n    Forgetfull of his owne, that mindes another’s cares.”\r\n\r\nAnd Shakespeare, from whom we can obtain a quotation on almost anything,\r\nmakes Othello say (Act iv. sc. 1):--\r\n\r\n                            “O devil, devil!\r\n    If that the earth could teem with woman’s tears,\r\n    Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile;--\r\n    Out of my sight!”\r\n\r\nGesner, and Topsell, in his “Historie of Four-Footed Beastes,” give the\r\naccompanying illustration of a hippopotamus eating a crocodile, the\r\noriginal of which, they say, came from the Coliseum at Rome, and was\r\nthen in the Vatican.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTopsell, in his “History of Serpents,” dwells lovingly, and lengthily,\r\non the crocodile. He says:--“Some have written that the Crocodile\r\nrunneth away from a man if he winke with his left eye, and looke\r\nsteadfastly uppon him with his right eye, but if this bee true, it is\r\nnot to be attributed to the vertue of the right eye, but onely to the\r\nrarenesse of sight, which is conspicuous to the Serpent from one eye.\r\nThe greatest terrour unto Crocodiles, as both _Seneca_ and _Pliny_\r\naffirme, are the inhabitants of the Ile _Tentyrus_ within _Nilus_, for\r\nthose people make them runne away with their voyces, and many times\r\npursue and take them in snares. Of these people speaketh _Solinus_ in\r\nthis manner:--There is a generation of men in the Ile _Tentyrus_ within\r\nthe waters of _Nilus_, which are of a most adverse nature to the\r\nCrocodile, dwelling also in the same place. And, although their persons\r\nor presence be of small stature, yet heerein is theyr courage admired,\r\nbecause at the suddaine sight of a Crocodile, they are no whit daunted;\r\nfor one of these dare meete and provoke him to runne away. They will\r\nalso leape into Rivers and swimme after the Crocodile, and, meeting\r\nwith it, without feare cast themselves uppon the Beasts backe, ryding on\r\nhim as uppon a horse. And if the Beast lift uppe his head to byte him,\r\nwhen hee gapeth they put into his mouth a wedge, holding it hard at both\r\nends with both their hands, and so, as it were with a bridle, leade, or\r\nrather drive, them captives to the Land, where, with theyr noyse, they\r\nso terrifie them, that they make them cast uppe the bodies which they\r\nhad swallowed into theyr bellies; and because of this antypathy in\r\nNature, the Crocodyles dare not come neare to this Iland.\r\n\r\n“And _Strabo_ also hath recorded, that at what time crocodiles were\r\nbrought to Rome, these _Tentyrites_ folowed and drove them. For whom\r\nthere was a certaine great poole or fish-pond assigned, and walled\r\nabout, except one passage for the Beast to come out of the water into\r\nthe sun shine: and when the people came to see them, these _Tentyrites_,\r\nwith nettes would draw them to the Land, and put them backe againe into\r\nthe water at theyr owne pleasure. For they so hooke them by theyr eyes,\r\nand bottome of their bellyes, which are their tenderest partes, that,\r\nlike as horses broken by theyr Ryders, they yeelde unto them, and forget\r\ntheyr strength in the presence of these theyr Conquerors....\r\n\r\n“To conclude this discourse of Crocodiles inclination, even the\r\nEgyptians themselves account a Crocodile a savage, and cruell murthering\r\nbeast, as may appeare by their Hieroglyphicks, for when they will\r\ndecypher a mad man, they picture a Crocodile, who beeing put from his\r\ndesired prey by forcible resistance, hee presently rageth against\r\nhimselfe. And they are often taught by lamentable experience, what\r\nfraude and malice to mankind liveth in these beasts; for, when they\r\ncover themselves under willowes and greene hollow bankes, till some\r\npeople come to the waters side to draw and fetch water, and then\r\nsuddenly, or ever they be aware, they are taken, and drawne into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“And also, for this purpose, because he knoweth that he is not able to\r\novertake a man in his course or chase, he taketh a great deale of water\r\nin his mouth, and casteth it in the pathwaies, so that when they\r\nendeavour to run from the crocodile, they fall downe in the slippery\r\npath, and are overtaken and destroyed by him. The common proverbe also,\r\n_Crocodili lachrimæ_, the Crocodile’s teares, justifieth the treacherous\r\nnature of this beast, for there are not many bruite beasts that can\r\nweepe, but such is the nature of the Crocodile, that to get a man within\r\nhis danger, he will sob, sigh, and weepe, as though he were in\r\nextremitie, but suddenly he destroyeth him. Others say, that the\r\nCrocodile weepeth after he hath devoured a man....\r\n\r\n“Seeing the friendes of it are so few, the enemies of it must needes be\r\nmany, and therefore require a more large catalogue or story. In the\r\nfirst ranke whereof commeth (as worthy the first place), the _Ichneumon_\r\nor _Pharaoh’s Mouse_, who rageth against their egges and their persons;\r\nfor it is certaine that it hunteth with all sagacity of sense to find\r\nout theyr nests, and having found them, it spoyleth, scattereth,\r\nbreaketh, and emptieth all theyr egs. They also watch the old ones a\r\nsleepe, and finding their mouths open against the beames of the Sunne,\r\nsuddenly enter into them, and, being small, creepe downe theyr vast and\r\nlarge throates before they be aware, and then, putting the Crocodile to\r\nexquisite and intollerable torment, by eating their guttes asunder, and\r\nso their soft bellies, while the Crocodile tumbleth to and fro sighing\r\nand weeping, now in the depth of water, now on the Land, never resting\r\ntill strength of nature fayleth. For the incessant gnawing of the\r\n_Ichneumon_ so provoketh her to seek her rest, in the unrest of every\r\npart, herbe, element, throwes, throbs, rowlings, tossings, mournings,\r\nbut all in vaine, for the enemy within her breatheth through her breath,\r\nand sporteth herselfe in the consumption of those vitall parts, which\r\nwast and weare away by yeelding to her unpacificable teeth, one after\r\nthe other, till shee that crept in by stealth at the mouth, like a puny\r\ntheefe, come out at the belly like a conquerour, thorough a passage\r\nopened by her owne labour and industry....\r\n\r\n“The medicines arising out of it are also many. The first place\r\nbelongeth to the Caule, which hath moe benefits or vertues in it, than\r\ncan be expressed. The bloud of a Crocodile is held profitable for many\r\nthinges, and among other, it is thought to cure the bitings of any\r\nSerpent. Also by annoynting the eyes, it cureth both the dregs, or spots\r\nof blood in them, and also restoreth soundnesse and clearenesse to the\r\nsight, taking away all dulnesse, or deadnesse from the eyes. And it is\r\nsaid, that if a man take the liquor which commeth from a piece of a\r\nCrocodyle fryed, and annoynte therewithall his wound or harmed part,\r\nthat then he shall bee presently rid of all paine and torment. The\r\nskinne both of the Land and Water Crocodile dryed into powder, and the\r\nsame powder, with Vineger or Oyle, layd upon a part or member of the\r\nbody, to be seared, cut off or lanced, taketh away all sense and feeling\r\nof paine from the instrument in the action.\r\n\r\n“All the Ægytians doe with the fat or sewet of a Crocodile, (_is to_)\r\nannoynt all them that be sick of Feavers, for it hath the same\r\noperation which the fat of a Sea-dogge, or Dog-fish hath, and, if those\r\nparts of men and beasts which are hurt and wounded with Crocodile’s\r\nteeth, be annoynted with this fat, it also cureth them. Being concocted\r\nwith Water and Vineger, and so rowled uppe and downe in the mouth, it\r\ncureth the tooth-ache: and also it is outwardly applyed agaynst the\r\nbyting of Flyes, Spyders, Wormes, and such like, for this cause, as also\r\nbecause it is thought to cure Wennes, bunches in the flesh, and olde\r\nwoundes. It is solde deare, and held pretious in _Alcair_, (Cairo.)\r\n_Scaliger_ writeth that it cureth the _Gangren_. The Canyne teeth which\r\nare hollow, filled with Frankinsence, and tyed to a man or woman, which\r\nhath the toothach, cureth them, if the party know not of the carrying\r\nthem about: And so they write, that if the little stones which are in\r\ntheir belly be taken forth and so used, they work the same effect\r\nagainst Feavers. The dung is profitable against the falling off of the\r\nhayre, and many such other things.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASILISK AND COCKATRICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAldrovandus portrays the Basilisk with eight legs. Topsell says it is\r\nthe same as the Cockatrice, depicts it as a crowned serpent, and\r\nsays:--“This Beast is called by the Græcian _Baziliscos_, and by the\r\nLatine, _Regulus_, because he seemeth to be the King of Serpents, not\r\nfor his magnitude or greatnesse: For there are many Serpents bigger than\r\nhe, as there be many foure-footed Beastes bigger than the Lyon, but,\r\nbecause of his stately pace, and magnanimious mind: for hee creepeth not\r\non the earth like other Serpents, but goeth halfe upright, for which\r\noccasion all other Serpentes avoyde his sight. And it seemeth nature\r\nhath ordayned him for that purpose; for, besides the strength of his\r\npoyson, which is uncurable, he hath a certain combe or Corronet uppon\r\nhis head, as shall be shewed in due place.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPliny thus describes “The Serpents called Basilisks. There is the same\r\npower[40] also in the serpent called the Basilisk. It is produced in\r\nthe province of Cyrene, being not more than twelve fingers in length. It\r\nhas a white spot on the head, strongly resembling a sort of diadem. When\r\nit hisses, all the other serpents fly from it: and it does not advance\r\nits body, like the others, by a succession of folds, but moves along\r\nupright and erect upon the middle. It destroys all shrubs, not only by\r\nits contact, but even those that it has breathed upon; it burns up all\r\nthe grass too, and breaks the stones, so tremendous is its noxious\r\ninfluence. It was formerly a general belief that if a man on horseback\r\nkilled one of these animals with a spear, the poison would run up the\r\nweapon and kill, not only the rider, but the horse as well. To this\r\ndreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing which has\r\nbeen tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body\r\nwhen killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should\r\nbe nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of\r\nthe basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being\r\ninfected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself\r\nin this struggle of nature against its own self.”\r\n\r\nDu Bartas says:--\r\n\r\n    “What shield of Ajax could avoid their death\r\n    By th’ Basilisk whose pestilentiall breath\r\n    Doth pearce firm Marble, and whose banefull eye\r\n    Wounds with a glance, so that the wounded dye.”\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Cockatrice is, to say the least, peculiar:--“There is\r\nsome question amongest Writers, about the generation of this Serpent:\r\nfor some, (and those very many and learned,) affirme him to be brought\r\nforth of a Cockes egge. For they say that when a Cocke groweth old, he\r\nlayeth a certaine egge without any shell, instead whereof it is covered\r\nwith a very thicke skinne, which is able to withstand the greatest force\r\nof an easie blow or fall. They say, moreover, that this Egge is layd\r\nonely in the Summer time, about the beginning of the Dogge-dayes, being\r\nnot so long as a Hens Egge, but round and orbiculer: Sometimes of a\r\nFoxie, sometimes of a yellowish muddy colour, which Egge is generated of\r\nthe putrified seed of the Cocke, and afterward sat upon by a Snake or a\r\nToad, bringeth forth the Cockatrice, being halfe a foot in length, the\r\nhinder part like a Snake, the former part like a Cocke, because of a\r\ntreble combe on his forehead.\r\n\r\n“But the vulger opinion of Europe is, that the Egge is nourished by a\r\nToad, and not by a Snake; howbeit, in better experience it is found that\r\nthe Cocke doth sit on that egge himselfe: whereof _Levinus Lemnius_ in\r\nhis twelfth booke of the hidden miracles of nature, hath this discourse,\r\nin the fourth chapter thereof. There happened (saith he) within our\r\nmemory in the Citty _Pirizæa_, that there were two old Cockes which had\r\nlayd Egges, but they could not, with clubs and staves drive them from\r\nthe Egges, untill they were forced to breake the egges in sunder, and\r\nstrangle the Cockes....\r\n\r\n“There be many grave humaine Writers, whose authority is irrefragable,\r\naffirming not onely that there be cockatrices, but also that they infect\r\nthe ayre, and kill with their sight. And _Mercuriall_ affirmeth, that\r\nwhen he was with _Maximilian_ the Emperour, hee saw the carkase of a\r\ncockatrice, reserved in his treasury among his undoubted monuments....\r\nWee doe read that in Rome, in the dayes of Pope _Leo_ the fourth (847 to\r\n855), there was a cockatrice found in a Vault of a Church or Chappell,\r\ndedicated to Saint _Lucea_, whose pestiferous breath hadde infected the\r\nAyre round about, whereby great mortality followed in Rome: but how the\r\nsaid Cockatrice came thither, it was never knowne. It is most probable\r\nthat it was created, and sent of God for the punnishment of the Citty,\r\nwhich I do the more easily beleeve, because _Segonius_ and _Julius\r\nScaliger_ do affirme, that the sayd pestiferous beast was killed by the\r\nprayers of the said _Leo_ the fourth....\r\n\r\n“The eyes of the Cockatrice are redde, or somewhat inclyning to\r\nblacknesse; the skin and carkase of this beast have beene accounted\r\nprecious, for wee doe read that the _Pergameni_ did buy but certaine\r\npeeces of a Cockatrice, and gave for it two pound and a halfe of Sylver:\r\nand because there is an opinion that no Byrd, Spyder, or venomous Beast\r\nwill endure the sight of this Serpent, they did hang uppe the skinne\r\nthereof stuffed, in the Temples of _Apollo_ and _Diana_, in a certaine\r\nthinne Net made of Gold; and therefore it is sayde, that never any\r\nSwallow, Spider, or other Serpent durst come within those Temples; And\r\nnot onely the skinne or the sight of the Cockatrice worketh this effect,\r\nbut also the flesh thereof, being rubbed uppon the pavement, postes, or\r\nWalles of any House. And moreover, if Silver bee rubbed over with the\r\npowder of the Cockatrices flesh, it is likewise sayde that it giveth it\r\na tincture like unto Golde: and, besides these qualities, I remember not\r\nany other in the flesh or skinne of this serpent....\r\n\r\n“We read also that many times in _Affrica_, the Mules fall downe dead\r\nfor thirst, or else lye dead on the ground for some other causes, unto\r\nwhose Carkase innumerable troupes of Serpentes gather themselves to\r\nfeede there uppon; but when the Bazeliske windeth the sayd dead body,\r\nhe giveth forth his voyce: at the first hearing whereof, all the\r\nSerpents hide themselves in the neare adjoyning sandes, or else runne\r\ninto theyr holes, not daring to come forth againe, untill the Cockatrice\r\nhave well dyned and satisfied himselfe. At which time he giveth another\r\nsignall by his voyce of his departure: then come they forth, but never\r\ndare meddle with the remnants of the dead beast, but go away to seeke\r\nsome other prey. And if it happen that any other pestiferous beast\r\ncometh unto the waters to drinke neare the place wherein the Cockatrice\r\nis lodged, so soone as he perceiveth the presence thereof, although it\r\nbe not heard nor seene, yet it departeth back againe, without drinking,\r\nneglecting his owne nutriment, to save itselfe from further danger:\r\nwhereupon _Lucanus_ saith,\r\n\r\n                _----Late sibi submovet omne\r\n    Vulgus, et in vacua regnat Basiliscus arena._\r\n\r\nWhich may be thus englished;\r\n\r\n    _He makes the vulgar farre from him to stand,\r\n    While Cockatrice alone raignes on the sand._\r\n\r\n“Now we are to intreate of the poyson of this serpent, for it is a hot\r\nand a venemous poyson, infecting the Ayre round about, so as no other\r\nCreature can live neare him, for it killeth, not onely by his hissing,\r\nand by his sight, (as is sayd of the Gorgons) but also by his touching,\r\nboth immediately, and mediately; that is to say, not onely when a man\r\ntoucheth the body it selfe, but also by touching a Weapon wherewith the\r\nbody was slayne, or any other dead beast slaine by it, and there is a\r\ncommon fame, that a Horseman taking a Speare in his hand, which had\r\nbeene thrust through a Cockatrice, did not onely draw the poyson of it\r\nunto his owne body, and so dyed, but also killed his horse thereby.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SALAMANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany writers have essayed this fabled creature, but almost all have\r\napproached the subject with diffidence, as if not quite sure of the\r\nabsolute entity of the animal. Thus, Aristotle does not speak of it\r\nauthoritatively:--“And the Salamander shews that it is possible for some\r\nanimal substances to exist in the fire, for _they say_ that fire is\r\nextinguished when this animal walks over it.” Pliny, on Salamanders,\r\nwrites:--“We find it stated by many authors, that a serpent is produced\r\nfrom the spinal marrow of a man. Many creatures, in fact, among the\r\nquadrupeds even, have a secret, and mysterious origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Thus, for instance, the salamander, an animal like a lizard in shape,\r\nand with a body starred all over, never comes out except during heavy\r\nshowers, and disappears the moment it becomes fine. This animal is so\r\nintensely cold as to extinguish fire by its contact, in the same way\r\nthat ice doth. It spits forth a milky matter from its mouth; and\r\nwhatever part of the human body is touched with this, all the hair falls\r\noff, and the part assumes the appearance of leprosy.... The wild boar of\r\nPamphylia, and the mountainous parts of Cilicia, after having devoured\r\na Salamander, will become poisonous to those who eat its flesh; and yet\r\nthe danger is quite imperceptible by reason of any peculiarity in the\r\nsmell and taste. The Salamander, too, will poison either water or wine\r\nin which it happens to be drowned; and, what is more, if it has only\r\ndrunk thereof, the liquid becomes poisonous.”\r\n\r\nThis idea of an animal supporting life in the fire is not confined to\r\nthe Salamander alone, for both Aristotle and Pliny aver that there is a\r\nfly which possesses this accomplishment. Says the former:--“In Cyprus,\r\nwhen the manufacturers of the stone called _chalcitis_ burn it for many\r\ndays in the fire, a winged creature something larger than a great fly is\r\nseen walking and leaping in the fire: these creatures perish when taken\r\nfrom the fire.” And the latter:--“That element, also, which is so\r\ndestructive to matter, produces certain animals; for in the\r\ncopper-smelting furnaces of Cyprus, in the very midst of the fire, there\r\nis to be seen, flying about, a four-footed animal with wings, the size\r\nof a large fly: this creature, called the ‘pyrallis,’ and by some the\r\n‘pyrausta.’ So long as it remains in the fire it will live, but if it\r\ncomes out, and flies a little distance from it, it will instantly die.”\r\n\r\nSer Marco Polo thoroughly pooh-poohs the idea of the Salamander, and\r\nsays it is Asbestos. Speaking of the Province of Chingintalas, he\r\nsays:--“And you must know that in the same mountain there is a vein of\r\nthe substance of which Salamander is made. For the real truth is that\r\nthe Salamander is no beast, as they allege in our part of the world, but\r\nis a substance found in the earth; and I will tell you about it.\r\n\r\n“Everybody must be aware that it can be no animal’s nature to live in\r\nfire, seeing that every animal is composed of all the four elements.\r\nNow, I, Marco Polo, had a Turkish acquaintance of the name of Zurficar,\r\nand he was a very clever fellow, and this Turk related to Messer Marco\r\nPolo how he had lived three years in that region on behalf of the Great\r\nKaan, in order to procure those Salamanders for him. He said that the\r\nway they got them was by digging in that mountain till they found a\r\ncertain vein. The substance of this vein was then taken and crushed,\r\nand, when so treated, it divides, as it were, into fibres of wool, which\r\nthey set forth to dry. When dry, these fibres were pounded in a great\r\ncopper mortar, and then washed, so as to remove all the earth, and to\r\nleave only the fibres, like fibres of wool. These were then spun, and\r\nmade into napkins. When first made, these napkins are not very white,\r\nbut by putting them in the fire for a while they come out as white as\r\nsnow. And so again, whenever they become dirty they are bleached by\r\nbeing put in the fire.\r\n\r\n“Now this, and nought else, is the truth about the Salamander, and the\r\npeople of the country all say the same. Any other account of the matter\r\nis fabulous nonsense. And I may add that they have, at Rome, a napkin\r\nout of this stuff, which the Grand Kaan sent to the Pope, to make a\r\nwrapper, for the Holy Sudarium of Jesus Christ.”\r\n\r\nThat extremely truthful person, Benvenuto Cellini, in his thoroughly\r\nveracious autobiography, tells us the following _Snake Story_:--“When I\r\nwas about five years old, my father happened to be in a basement-chamber\r\nof our house, where they had been washing, and where a good fire of\r\noak-logs was still burning; he had a viol in his hand, and was playing\r\nand singing alone beside the fire.\r\n\r\n“The weather was very cold. Happening to look into the fire, he spied in\r\nthe middle of those most burning flames a little creature like a lizard,\r\nwhich was sporting in the core of the intensest coals. Becoming\r\ninstantly aware of what the thing was, he had my sister and me called,\r\nand, pointing it out to us children, gave me a great box on the ears,\r\nwhich caused me to howl and weep with all my might. Then he pacified me\r\ngood-humouredly, and spoke as follows: ‘My dear little boy, I am not\r\nstriking you for any wrong that you have done, but only to make you\r\nremember that that lizard which you see in the fire is a salamander, a\r\ncreature which has never been seen before, by any one of whom we have\r\ncredible information.’ So saying, he kissed me, and gave me some pieces\r\nof money.”\r\n\r\nEven Topsell is half-hearted about its fire-resisting qualities, giving\r\nno modern instances, and only, for it, quoting old authors. According to\r\nhis account, and to the picture which I have taken from him, the\r\nSalamander is not a prepossessing-looking animal:--“The Salamander is\r\nalso foure-footed like a Lyzard, and all the body over it is set with\r\nspots of blacke and yellow, yet is the sight of it abhominable, and\r\nfearefull to man. The head of it is great, and sometimes they have\r\nyellowish bellyes and tayles, and sometimes earthy.”\r\n\r\nHe also says its bite is not only poisonous, but incurable, and that it\r\npoisons all it touches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nToads were always considered venomous and spiteful, and they had but one\r\nredeeming quality, which seems to be lost to its modern descendants:--\r\n\r\n    “Sweet are the uses of adversity;\r\n    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,\r\n    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.”\r\n\r\n    (_As You Like It_, Act ii. sc. 1.)\r\n\r\nPliny says of these animals:--“Authors quite vie with one another in\r\nrelating marvellous stories about them; such, for instance, as that if\r\nthey are brought into the midst of a concourse of people, silence will\r\ninstantly prevail; as also that, by throwing into boiling water, a small\r\nbone that is found in their right side, the vessel will immediately\r\ncool, and the water refuse to boil again until it has been removed. This\r\nbone, they say, may be found by exposing a dead toad to ants, and\r\nletting them eat away the flesh; after which the bones must be put into\r\nthe vessel one by one.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, again, in the left side of this reptile there is\r\nanother bone, they say, which, when thrown into water, has all the\r\nappearance of making it boil, and the name given to which is ‘apocynon’\r\n(_averting dogs_). This bone it is said has the property of assuaging\r\nthe fury of dogs, and, if put in the drink, of conciliating love, and\r\nending discord and strife. Worn, too, as an amulet, it acts as an\r\naphrodisiac, we are told.”\r\n\r\nTopsell writes so diffusely on the virtues of these “toad stones” that I\r\ncan only afford space for a portion of his remarks:--“There be many late\r\nWriters, which doe affirme that there is a precious stone in the head of\r\na Toade, whose opinions (because they attribute much to the vertue of\r\nthis stone) is good to examine in this place.... There be many that\r\nweare these stones in Ringes, beeing verily perswaded that they keepe\r\nthem from all manner of grypings and paines of the belly, and the small\r\nguttes. But the Art, (as they term it) is in taking of it out, for they\r\nsay it must be taken out of the head alive, before the Toade be dead,\r\nwith a peece of cloth of the colour of redde Skarlet, wherewithall they\r\nare much delighted, so that while they stretch out themselves as it were\r\nin sport upon that cloth, they cast out the stone of their head, but\r\ninstantly they sup it up againe, unlesse it be taken from them through\r\nsome secrete hole in the said cloth, whereby it falleth into a cesterne\r\nor vessell of water, into the which the Toade dare not enter, by reason\r\nof the coldnes of the water....\r\n\r\n“This stone is that which in auncient time was called _Batrachites_, and\r\nthey attribute unto it a vertue besides the former, namely, for the\r\nbreaking of the stone in the bladder, and against the Falling sicknes.\r\nAnd they further write that it is a discoverer of present poyson, for in\r\nthe presence of poyson it will change the colour. And this is the\r\nsubstaunce of that which is written about this stone. Now for my part I\r\ndare not conclude either with it, or against it, for many are directlie\r\nfor this stone ingendered in the braine or head of the Toade: on the\r\nother side, some confesse such a stone by name and nature, but they make\r\ndoubt of the generation of it, as others have delivered; and therefore,\r\nthey beeing in sundry opinions, the hearing whereof might confound the\r\nReader, I will referre him for his satisfaction unto a Toade, which hee\r\nmay easily every day kill: For although when the Toade is dead, the\r\nvertue thereof be lost, which consisted in the eye, or blew spot in the\r\nmiddle, yet the substance remaineth, and, if the stone be found there in\r\nsubstance, then is the question at an end; but, if it be not, then must\r\nthe generation of it be sought for in some other place.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leech has, from a very early age, been used as a means of letting\r\nblood; but, among the old Romans, it had medicinal uses such as we know\r\nnot of now. It was used as a hair dye. Pliny gives two receipts for\r\nmaking it, and it must have been powerful stuff, if we can believe his\r\nauthority:--“Leeches left to putrify for forty days in red wine, stain\r\nthe hair black. Others, again, recommend one sextarius of leeches to be\r\nleft to putrefy the same number of days in a leaden vessel, with two\r\nsextarii of vinegar, the hair to be well rubbed with the mixture in the\r\nsun. According to Sornatius this preparation is, naturally, so\r\npenetrating, that if females, when they apply it, do not take the\r\nprecaution of keeping some oil in the mouth, the teeth, even, will\r\nbecome blackened thereby.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOlaus Magnus gives us the accompanying picture of the luxurious man in\r\nhis arm-chair by the river-side, catching his own leeches, and suffering\r\nfrom gnats; and also his far more prudent friend, who makes the\r\nexperiment on the vile body of his horse, and thus saves his own blood;\r\nbut he gives us no account of its habits and customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCORPION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Scorpion, Pliny says:--“This animal is a dangerous scourge, and\r\nhas a venom like that of the serpent; with the exception that its\r\neffects are far more painful, as the person who is stung will linger for\r\nthree days before death ensues. The sting is invariably fatal to\r\nvirgins, and nearly always so to matrons. It is so to men also, in the\r\nmorning, when the animal has issued from its hole in a fasting state,\r\nand has not yet happened to discharge its poison by an accidental\r\nstroke. The tail is always ready to strike, and ceases not for an\r\ninstant to menace, so that no opportunity may possibly be lost....\r\n\r\n“In Scythia, the Scorpion is able to kill even the swine, with its\r\nsting, an animal which, in general, is proof against poisons of this\r\nkind in a remarkable degree. When stung, those swine which are black,\r\ndie more speedily than others, and more particularly if they happen to\r\nthrow themselves into the water. When a person has been stung, it is\r\ngenerally supposed that he may be cured by drinking the ashes of the\r\nScorpion mixed with wine. It is the belief also that nothing is more\r\nbaneful to the Scorpion than to dip it in oil.... Some writers, too, are\r\nof opinion that the Scorpion devours its offspring, and that the one\r\namong the young which is most adroit avails itself of its sole mode of\r\nescape, by placing itself on the back of the mother, and thus finding a\r\nplace where it is in safety from the tail and sting. The one that thus\r\nescapes, they say, becomes the avenger of the rest, and, at last, taking\r\nadvantage of its elevated position, puts its parents to death.”\r\n\r\nTopsell has some marvels to relate concerning the generation of\r\nScorpions:--“And it is reported by _Elianus_, that about _Estamenus_ in\r\nIndia, there are abundance of Scorpions generated, onely by corrupt\r\nraine water standing in that place. Also, out of the Baziliske beaten\r\ninto peeces, and so putrified, are Scorpions engendred. And when as one\r\nhad planted the herbe _Basilica_ on a wall, in the roome or place\r\nthereof hee found two Scorpions. And some say that if a man chaw in his\r\nmouth, fasting, this herbe Basill before he wash, and, afterwards, lay\r\nthe same abroade uncovered where no sun commeth at it for the space of\r\nseaven nights, taking it in all the daytime, he shall at length find it\r\ntransmuted into a Scorpion, with a tayle of seaven knots.\r\n\r\n“_Hollerius_, to take away all scruple of this thing, writeth that in\r\nItaly, in his dayes, there was a man that had a Scorpion bredde in his\r\nbraine, by continuall smelling to this herbe Basil; and _Gesner_ by\r\nrelation of an Apothecary in Fraunce, writeth also a storie of a young\r\nmayde, who by smelling to Basill, fell into an exceeding head-ach,\r\nwhereof she died without cure, and, after her death, beeing opened,\r\nthere were found little Scorpions in her braine.\r\n\r\n“_Aristotle_ remembreth an herbe which he calleth _Sisimbriæ_, out of\r\nwhich putrified Scorpions are engendered. And wee have showed already,\r\nin the history of the Crocodile, that out of the Crocodile’s egges doe\r\nmany times come Scorpions, which at their first egression doe kill theyr\r\ndam that hatched them.”\r\n\r\nThere is a curious legend, that if a Scorpion is surrounded by fire, so\r\nthat it cannot escape, it will commit suicide by stinging itself to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one would credit the industrious Ant, whose ways we are told to\r\nconsider, and gather wisdom therefrom, was avaricious and lustful after\r\ngold; but it seems it was even so, at least, in Pliny’s time; but then\r\nthey were abnormally large:--“The horns of an Indian Ant, suspended in\r\nthe temple of Hercules at Erythræ (_Ritri_) have been looked upon as\r\nquite miraculous for their size. This ant excavates gold from holes, in\r\na country to the north of India, the inhabitants of which are known as\r\nthe Dardæ. It has the colour of a cat, and is in size as large as an\r\nEgyptian wolf. This gold, which it extracts in the winter, is taken by\r\nthe Indians during the heats of summer, while the Ants are compelled, by\r\nthe excessive warmth, to hide themselves in their holes. Still, however,\r\non being aroused by catching the scent of the Indians, they sally forth,\r\nand frequently tear them to pieces, though provided with the swiftest\r\nCamels for the purpose of flight; so great is their fleetness, combined\r\nwith their ferocity, and their passion for gold!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Busy Bee, too, according to Olaus Magnus, developed, in the regions\r\nof the North, a peculiarity to which it seems a stranger with us, but\r\nwhich might be encouraged, with beneficial effect, by the Temperance\r\nSocieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Bees infested drunkards, being drawn to them by the smell of the\r\nliquor with which they had soaked their bodies, and stung them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORNET.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo also, up North, they seem to have had a special breed of Hornets,\r\nwhich must have been ferocious indeed, sparing neither man nor beast, as\r\nis evidenced by the corpses, and by the extremely energetic efforts of\r\nthe yet living man to cope with his enemies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Supposed to be Sumatra.\r\n\r\n[2] γης κλειθρον, meaning the limit or boundary of the earth.\r\n\r\n[3] The Gryphon must not be confounded with the Griffin, as will be seen\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n[4] The Roman cubit was eighteen inches, so that these men were nearly\r\neight feet high.\r\n\r\n[5] From ἀπὸ τοῦ μονοῦ κώλου, “from having but one leg.”\r\n\r\n[6] From Σκιαποῦς, “making a shadow with his foot.”\r\n\r\n[7] See illustration, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[8] Sparrow footed, from στροῦθος, a sparrow.\r\n\r\n[9] Probably cotton.\r\n\r\n[10] Or long livers, from μακρὸς, “long,” and βίος, “life.”\r\n\r\n[11] A palm was three inches, so that these men would be eight feet\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n[12] From Γυμνητὴς, one who takes much bodily exercise.\r\n\r\n[13] Mirage.\r\n\r\n[14] Other editions read _rough hair_.\r\n\r\n[15] In Greek, Τοπάζω, means to guess, divine, or conjecture.\r\n\r\n[16] Burn.\r\n\r\n[17] Breast.\r\n\r\n[18] At war.\r\n\r\n[19] From τρεις, _three_, σπιθαμὰι, _spans_.\r\n\r\n[20] Other editions say six or seven years.\r\n\r\n[21] See his letters dated September 1888, which arrived in England\r\nearly in April 1889.\r\n\r\n[22] Ox horns, horn cups.\r\n\r\n[23] A lake between Macedonia and Thrace.\r\n\r\n[24] The fishermen of lake Prasias still have lake dwellings as in the\r\ntime of Herodotus.\r\n\r\n[25] The most abundant were the oyster, mussel, cockle, and periwinkle.\r\n\r\n[26] Transactions of the Ethnological Society, 1866, vol. iv., p. 34.\r\n\r\n[27] Thyrsi.\r\n\r\n[28] The italics are mine.--J.
