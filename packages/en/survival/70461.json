Isolated by arid and\r\ndesolate wastes, these communities occupy quaint walled-in towns\r\nand villages, tucked away among groves of palms, interspersed\r\nwith smiling gardens and fields of corn. Rain is almost unknown,\r\nand rivers are non-existent, the trees and crops being irrigated\r\nby bubbling wells, deriving their waters from deep-seated sources.\r\n\r\nKharga—the subject of the present memoir—formed part of the Great\r\nOasis of ancient days, and was governed in turn by the Pharaohs, the\r\nPersian Monarchs, and the Roman Emperors. Through it the ill-fated\r\narmy of Cambyses is recorded to have marched, and in it is to be\r\nseen the most important Persian monument in Egypt, the temple of\r\nHibis. But most interesting of all is the wonderfully preserved Early\r\nChristian necropolis, dating from the time of Bishop Nestorius, who\r\nwas banished to Kharga in A.D. 434. Juvenal, Athanasius, and other\r\ncelebrities likewise appear to have made unwilling acquaintance\r\nwith this portion of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe character of the people at the present day—a curious mixture\r\nof stupidity, apathy, and shrewdness—seems to reflect in great\r\nmeasure their past history, as well as the peculiar conditions\r\nunder which they still live. A history of the inhabitants since\r\nthe withdrawal of the Roman garrisons would resolve itself into\r\nan account of an endless combat with Nature, which, with sand and\r\nwind as its chief agents, has never abated its efforts to recover\r\nthose tracts which the Ancients, by the exercise of much skill and\r\nindustry, wrested from the desert.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Geological Survey of Egypt from 1896 to 1905,\r\nI spent nearly nine years in survey and exploration work in the\r\nEgyptian deserts, and for the past three years I have been in\r\ncharge of extensive boring and land-reclamation operations in the\r\nparticular oasis with which this book deals, so that I have had\r\nexceptional opportunities of studying at first hand a region of\r\npeculiar interest. Among other questions dealt with are the vast\r\nsystems of subterranean aqueducts constructed by the Romans; the\r\nextensive lakes which occupied the floor of the oasis-depression\r\nwell into historic times; the rate and mode of movement of desert\r\nsand-dunes; the formation and gradual elevation of the cultivated\r\nterraces by the constant accumulation of wind-borne material; and\r\nthe deep-seated water-supplies, a subject which, in view of recent\r\ndiscussions as to the origin of the artesian waters of arid regions,\r\nis of more than local interest.\r\n\r\nSome portions of the book, more especially those dealing with\r\ngeology and water-supply, have already been published in somewhat\r\ndifferent form in the Geological Magazine, and I am indebted to\r\nDr. Henry Woodward, F.R.S., for permission to reproduce them, as\r\nwell as the plate showing Bore No. 39 and the geological section\r\nacross the oasis.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are reproduced from photographs taken by\r\nme at different times during the last few years. The maps,\r\nshowing the relative positions of the oasis and the Nile Valley,\r\nthe caravan roads, and the geology, have been compiled from all\r\navailable published material, chiefly the work of Dr. John Ball and\r\nmyself. Some portions of these, as well as the plan showing the\r\nsubterranean aqueducts of Um El Dabâdib, are now published for\r\nthe first time. The caravan routes, while shown with sufficient\r\naccuracy for all practical purposes, have not been surveyed with\r\nthe same degree of exactness as the other details shown on the maps.\r\n\r\n                                              H.

There are arid wastes in many parts of the world—in\r\nAustralia, in the Western States of America, in Asia—but in\r\npoint of desolateness, in the absence of animal and vegetable life,\r\nthere is probably nothing to rival the greater portion of the Libyan\r\nDesert, on the west side of the Nile. Its barrenness is aggressive;\r\nit is not necessary to travel far to make its acquaintance; so sharp\r\nis the junction that, in a single step, one may pass from the richly\r\ncultivated alluvial soil of the Nile to the bare sandy plains which\r\nskirt the more rocky interior of the desert. Along the borders of the\r\nEgyptian wastes one generally looks in vain for the Persian poet’s\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “Strip of herbage strown,\r\n    That just divides the desert from the sown.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographically the Libyan Desert is the eastern and most inhospitable\r\nportion of the Sahara, or Great Desert of Africa. On the north and\r\neast its boundaries are clearly defined by the Mediterranean Sea and\r\nthe Valley of the Nile; on the south it is bounded by the Darfur\r\nand Kordofan regions of the Egyptian Sudan; to the south-west its\r\nlimits may be regarded as coterminous with the elevated districts\r\nof Tibesti; while on the west it stretches to the outlying oases\r\nof Fezzan and Tripoli. Its area is about 850,000 square miles,\r\nor approximately seven times that of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a narrow belt fringing the Mediterranean, the\r\nregion is, to all intents and purposes, rainless, the occasional\r\nthunderstorms being extremely local, and seldom breaking over\r\nthe same district in two consecutive years. In the more elevated\r\ndeserts on the eastern side of the Nile rains appear to be of\r\nsufficiently frequent occurrence to maintain a water-supply in the\r\nisolated water-holes and valley-springs, and to allow of the growth\r\nof a fairly permanent though scanty herbage in the more favoured\r\nareas. The Eastern desert does, therefore, to some extent, support\r\na migratory Arab population. On the other hand, the greater portion\r\nof the Libyan Desert is quite devoid of vegetation and water-holes,\r\nand is, in consequence, uninhabited even by nomad tribes. At the\r\nsame time, the extreme barrenness of the region as a whole is in\r\ngreat measure counterbalanced by a number of isolated fertile oases,\r\nin which there is a permanent resident population, deriving its\r\nwater-supplies entirely from underground sources.\r\n\r\nThe term ‘oasis,’ an ancient Egyptian word signifying a\r\nresting-place, in its strict sense means a fertile spot in a desert,\r\nbut in Egypt has usually been applied to a depression as a whole,\r\neach individual cultivated area being known by the name of the\r\nwell from which its water is derived. The chief groups of oases in\r\nthe Libyan Desert are the Siwan on the north, that of Kufra on the\r\nwest, and the Egyptian, including the four large oases of Baharia,\r\nFarafra, Dakhla, and Kharga, on the east. The present volume deals\r\nmore especially with the last of these.\r\n\r\nThe Libyan Desert is primarily divisible into two entirely\r\ndifferent parts, distinguished by the presence or absence of\r\nsurface accumulations of blown sand. Extensive dunes are confined\r\nto the western portion, where areas of hundreds of square miles\r\nare literally buried under deep seas of sand, blown into more\r\nor less parallel dunes of great height, lying N.N.W. and S.S.E.,\r\nin the direction of the prevailing winds. In this country it is\r\nalmost impossible to travel in a latitudinal direction, so that the\r\nsand-covered area forms an effective barrier between the Egyptian\r\noases and Kufra, one of the strongholds and, at any rate until\r\nrecently, the headquarters of the powerful Senussi sect. It is\r\nprobable that, within the last century, the area of this sand has\r\nextended considerably to the south, as an old caravan road trending\r\nwestwards, and believed to have originally connected the oases of\r\nDakhla and Kufra, is now lost in the dunes. As long ago as 1874\r\nsome of the members of the Rohlfs expedition made an attempt to\r\npenetrate westwards from Dakhla, but on reaching the edge of the\r\ngreat sand-region, about 170 kilometres W.S.W. of Qasr Dakhl, were\r\ncompelled to turn northwards and travel in a direction parallel\r\nto the lines of dunes, from which they emerged, after a long and\r\nwearisome journey of 400 kilometres, in the neighbourhood of the\r\noasis of Siwa. Outlying portions of this sand invade the Egyptian\r\noases; for instance, the depression of El Daila, lying to the west\r\nof Farafra, is to a great extent filled with blown sand, while an\r\nextensive area in the south of Farafra itself is buried under dunes.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern portion the sand is for the most part confined to\r\nisolated lines of dunes, the most remarkable being that known as\r\nthe Abu Mohariq. This commences in latitude 29° 45′ north, at\r\nArûs el Buqar, some 50 kilometres south-west of the Mogara swamp,\r\nin the low country to the south of the great east and west Miocene\r\nescarpment. From Arûs el Buqar the Abu Mohariq sand-belt runs in\r\nan almost straight and unbroken line across the Libyan plateau to\r\nthe oasis of Kharga, through which it continues into the desert\r\nto the south. The average breadth of this line of dunes is only\r\nsome 6 or 7 kilometres, whereas its length cannot be less than\r\n650. Less extensive accumulations of blown sand are found in the\r\noases themselves, in the depressions of Gharaq and Muailla to the\r\nsouth of the Fayûm, and encroaching on the cultivated lands of\r\nthe Nile Valley between Bahnessa and Mellawi.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the Libyan Desert, in which are situated\r\nthe Egyptian oases, is itself divisible into three areas having\r\nessentially different characters, the northern being an undulating\r\nrolling country of sandstones, grits, and gravels; the central\r\nconsisting of bare elevated limestone plateaux; the southern a\r\nlower-lying expanse of rugged sandstone, broken only occasionally\r\nby ridges and bosses of granite and other crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian oases are deep and broad hollows or depressions in the\r\nLibyan Desert plateau. In position they appear to coincide with areas\r\nwhere rocks of comparative softness became exposed at the surface\r\nduring the gradual lowering of the country by denudation. At such\r\npoints the general rate of weathering must have become greatly\r\naccelerated, with the result that those vast depressions, which\r\nform such conspicuous features in the configuration of the country\r\nat the present day, were eventually cut out.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the greater part of the Libyan Desert are porous\r\nsandstones, and these, when pierced by deep borings put down from the\r\nlower-lying parts of the floors of the depressions, yield abundant\r\nsupplies of water of remarkable purity. As these sandstones, as\r\nwell as the shales with which they are associated, have a general\r\ndip or inclination from south to north, we are led to infer that\r\nthey outcrop or come to the surface to the south, so that in all\r\nprobability the water with which they are so highly charged has\r\nits origin in that direction. Whether the water obtains access to\r\nthe sandstones by direct infiltration of the rains of Abyssinia or\r\nthe Sudan, from the swamps of the sudd region of the Upper Nile,\r\nor from the Nile itself in the Nubian reaches, has not yet been\r\ndecided with certainty. Recent observations, however, show that far\r\nmore water is lost in some reaches of the Nile than can be accounted\r\nfor by irrigation and evaporation, and it seems probable, therefore,\r\nthat the excess disappears by infiltration into these sandstones.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the early history of the oases, though the\r\nremains of ancient towns and cemeteries are abundant, and only await\r\nsystematic excavation by Egyptologists to bring our knowledge of\r\nthis part of Egypt into line with that of the Nile Valley. That\r\nthe oases were inhabited in prehistoric times is evident from the\r\noccurrence of flint implements of Palæolithic types, both on the\r\nmargins of the surrounding plateaux and within the depressions,\r\nthough there is not at present sufficient evidence to enable us to\r\naffirm that the makers and users of these flints were contemporaneous\r\nwith Palæolithic man in Europe. Implements of Neolithic type,\r\noften of finished workmanship, are, moreover, common in places on\r\nthe floors of the depressions, but it is probable that these were\r\nin use well into the historic period.\r\n\r\nIn historic times the oases, according to Sayce, were governed by\r\nEgyptian Kings in the eighteenth dynasty (1545-1350 B.C.), and the\r\noldest monuments as yet found in the oases-depressions date from this\r\nperiod. The most important of the earlier remains belong, however,\r\nto the Persian epoch, notably the temple of Hibis near the modern\r\nvillage of Kharga, which was built by Darius. Ptolemaic remains\r\nare also known in Kharga, but the greater number of the historical\r\nmonuments date from the time of Roman occupation, when the oases\r\nappear to have attained a considerable degree of prosperity, which\r\ncontinued to Coptic times. Since the Mohammedan conquest of Egypt\r\nthey have fallen into a state of neglect, and with the consequent\r\ndiminution of the water-supply the population has decreased, and\r\nlarge areas of formerly fertile country have been absorbed by the\r\nsurrounding desert.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to speculate on the conditions which obtained\r\nin Kharga before the first borings were made, as at the present\r\nday we cannot point, so far as I am aware, to a single natural\r\nefflux of water on the floor of the depression. Surface-water,\r\nof quite a different character from the deep-seated water, is\r\nmet with at comparatively shallow depths in various localities,\r\nand may either represent drainage water from the flowing wells\r\nand cultivated tracts, or be water which has escaped from the\r\nunderground sandstones and found its way to the surface through\r\nfissures. Probably it is derived from both sources. In prehistoric\r\ntimes natural springs fed through fissures may have existed here\r\nand there within the depressions; and in any case it is probable\r\nthat prehistoric man obtained sufficient supplies by sinking wells\r\ninto the upper sandstones, which in some parts of the oasis occur at\r\nor near the surface, and contain large quantities of sub-surface or\r\nsub-artesian water. Nothing is known as to when flowing wells were\r\nfirst obtained, or by whom the original deep borings were made,\r\nand no traces of the implements used have been discovered. Many of\r\nthese ancient wells, frequently over 120 metres in depth, continue\r\nto flow at the present day, although in most cases with a greatly\r\ndiminished output; a few, however, are still running day and night\r\nat the rate of several hundred gallons a minute.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the oases water-bearing sandstones occur at\r\nor near the surface, and from these beds the Romans obtained\r\nadditional supplies by the excavation of underground collecting\r\ntunnels. Subterranean works of this description are found in all the\r\noases, the most remarkable being in Baharia and at Um el Dabâdib\r\nand Jebel Lebekha in Kharga. They are frequently of great length,\r\ncut throughout in solid rock, and connected with the surface above\r\nby numerous vertical air-shafts. Many of the latter measure from 30\r\nto 50 metres in depth, so that the construction of these and the\r\nhorizontal carrying channels must have involved an immense amount\r\nof labour.\r\n\r\nIn Roman times water-stations appear to have been maintained\r\nat frequent intervals on the desert roads between the oases and\r\nthe Nile Valley, and a great development of the water-supply took\r\nplace. After the Arab invasion, however, no attention seems to have\r\nbeen given to irrigation works, the wells, owing to silting, becoming\r\ngradually choked up. As the result of this neglect the water-supply\r\ndiminished to such an extent that a large portion of the population\r\nwas compelled to emigrate to the Nile Valley, and even the remaining\r\ninhabitants were scarce able to raise sufficient supplies for their\r\nmaintenance. Within the last fifty years a considerable number of\r\nnew wells have been made by means of simple hand-boring appliances\r\nsent out by the Egyptian Government; most of the new bores have\r\nbeen very successful, but latterly, through want of effective\r\nsupervision, a great deal of harm has been done by promiscuous\r\nboring. Moreover, a very large amount of water is wasted owing to\r\nthe wells not being fitted with regulating and closing appliances;\r\nthe water, when not required for irrigation, continues to run,\r\nfinding its way to the low-lying lands, and forming swamps which\r\nfurnish ideal breeding-grounds for fever-carrying mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nWithin the last year or two this part of Egypt has received renewed\r\nattention; extensive boring operations and land reclamation works\r\nhave been commenced, and the oasis of Kharga has been brought into\r\nrailway communication with the rest of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe floor-level of the oases varies considerably, but in general the\r\ncultivated lands lie between 30 and 120 metres above sea-level. The\r\nexact area under cultivation is only known very approximately,\r\nbut it is certain that with an increased water-supply it could\r\nbe very much augmented. The existing water-supply is totally\r\ninsufficient to irrigate the available lands, and such portions of\r\nthe latter as are tilled are generally left fallow in alternate\r\nyears, and in many cases are only under crops once every four or\r\nfive years. Now that an attempt is being made to restore the oases\r\nto their former prosperity, the question of ownership of land has\r\nbecome of the greatest importance, and it is one bristling with\r\ndifficulties. As a general rule the wells are owned collectively,\r\nthe different proprietors having the right to utilize the flow\r\nfor periods corresponding to the extent of their holdings in\r\nthe well. Individual shares may amount to as much as one-third\r\nor one-half of the well, or be only the merest fraction; in the\r\nlatter case the small holders combine so as to obtain control of\r\nthe flow for an appreciable period. Frequently the whole of the\r\nland irrigated by a well is cultivated collectively, the crop on\r\nreaping being divided among the owners in portions corresponding to\r\ntheir shares of the water. The question of ownerships is further\r\ncomplicated by there being persons who own water but no land,\r\nand by others who claim land but own no water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                             EARLY RECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTravellers’ Names inscribed on the Monuments — Poncet passes\r\nthrough Kharga _en route_ for Ethiopia — Browne — Cailliaud’s\r\nExtensive Researches — Drovetti — Sir Archibald Edmonstone,\r\nBart., discovers Dakhla Oasis — Hoskins — Exaggerated Opinions of\r\nAncients regarding the Oases — Names of Explorers on the Walls of\r\nHibis — Rohlfs’ Expedition — Zittel’s Geological Work —\r\nThe words ‘Oasis,’ ‘Wah,’ ‘Otu,’ and ‘Set-ament’\r\n— A Theban Myth — Dr. Schweinfurth — Brugsch Bey — Captain\r\nH. G. Lyons — Government Survey of the Oases — Dr. John Ball.\r\n\r\n\r\nInscribed on the walls of the ancient monuments in the oasis one\r\nfrequently comes across the names of travellers who visited the\r\nsame scenes fifty, a hundred, or even two hundred years ago. Many\r\nof these explorers wrote descriptions of their travels and\r\nexperiences, and such early records are naturally of the greatest\r\ninterest and importance; unfortunately they are now out of print\r\nand somewhat difficult to procure, so that I make no apology for\r\nbriefly referring to those which I have been able to examine. Most\r\nof these early records are extremely quaint, and although they are\r\nchiefly descriptive of the personal experiences and impressions of\r\nthe writers, in some cases numerous observations are recorded in\r\na sufficiently exact manner to be of permanent scientific value.\r\n\r\nA French physician, Monsieur Poncet, who passed through Kharga\r\nin 1698, _en route_ for Abyssinia, appears to have been the\r\nonly traveller who left any written records of the Great Oasis\r\nbetween the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. A translation\r\nof the account of his travels was published in English in 1709\r\n(‘A Voyage to Æthiopia’). Accompanied by one Hagi Ali, an\r\nofficer of the Abyssinian Emperor, and by a Jesuit missionary,\r\nFather Charles Francis Xaverius de Brevedent, Poncet set out from\r\nthe town of Manfalut in the Nile Valley, and travelled along the\r\nDerb el Arbaîn, the well-known caravan route to the south. His\r\ndescription of this portion of the journey is as follows:\r\n\r\n“We set forward on the 2d of October early in the Morning, and\r\nfrom that very Day we enter’d a frightful Desart. These Desarts\r\nare extremely dangerous, because the Sands being moving are rais’d\r\nby the least Wind which darken the Air, and falling afterwards in\r\nClouds, Passingers are often buried in them, or at least lose the\r\nRoute, which they ought to keep.”\r\n\r\nPoncet refers to the oasis as ‘Helaoue,’ but although his caravan\r\nrested there four days, before proceeding to Dongola, via Shebb\r\nand Selîma, he makes no reference to the antiquities; in fact, his\r\nremarks on this region are extremely meagre. To quote his own words:\r\n“We Arriv’d on the 6th of October at Helaoue; ’Tis a pretty\r\nlarge Borough, and the last that is under the Grand Signior’\r\nJurisdiction. There is a Garrison in it of 500 Janisaries and 300\r\nSpahi’s under the Command of an Officer whom in that Country they\r\ncall Kachif. Helaoue is very pleasant, and answers fully its Name,\r\nwhich signifies a Country of Sweetness. Here are to be seen a great\r\nNumber of Gardens water’d with Brooks, and a World of Palm-trees,\r\nwhich preserve a continual Verdure, Coloquintida is to be found\r\nthere, and all the Fields are fill’d with Senna, which grows upon\r\na Shrub, about three Foot High. This Drug which is so esteem’d\r\nin Europe, is of no use in the Country hereabouts. The Inhabitants\r\nof Helaoue in their Illnesses, make only Use of the Root of Ezula,\r\nwhich for a whole Night they infuse in Milk, and take the day after,\r\nhaving first Strain’d it thro’ a Sieve. This Medicine is very\r\nViolent, but ’tis what they like and commend very much. The Ezula\r\nis a thick Tree, the Blossom of which is blue; it grows into a sort\r\nof Ball, of an Oval Figure, full of Cotton, of which the People of\r\nthat Country make pretty fine Cloth.”\r\n\r\nReferring to the deserts which surround the oases, Poncet remarks:\r\n“Those vast Wildernesses, where there is neither to be found Bird,\r\nnor wild Beast, nor Herbs, no nor so much as a little Fly, and where\r\nnothing is to be seen but Mountains of Sand, and the Carcasses,\r\nand Bones of Camels, Imprint a certain horrour in the Mind, which\r\nmakes this Voyage very tedious and disagreeable. It wou’d be a\r\nhard matter, to Cross those frightful Desarts without the Assistance\r\nof Camels. These Animals will continue six or seven Days, without\r\neither eating or drinking, which I cou’d never have believ’d,\r\nif I had not observ’d it very particularly.” Poncet further\r\nrelates that he was assured by a venerable old gentleman of his\r\ncaravan that camels had been known to cover a desert journey of\r\nforty days and nights without either food or water. Although it is\r\nto be feared that the ‘ship of the desert’ at the present day is\r\nscarcely so abstemious as formerly, we must admit that Poncet’s\r\ndescription of the sterility of the Libyan Desert is little, if at\r\nall, exaggerated. One may, indeed, travel for hours without seeing\r\nbird, beast, or herb; and even ‘the little fly,’ which seldom\r\nfails to make known its presence for some time after leaving the\r\ninhabited districts, generally forsakes one before the caravan has\r\nproceeded far into the depths of the desert.\r\n\r\nW. G. Browne traversed the same route nearly a hundred years later,\r\npassing through the oasis in June, 1793. He relates how he entered\r\nthe depression at the northern extremity, at the pass known as El\r\nRamlia, and camped at Ain Dizé (probably in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe modern Ain el Qasr), eight hours’ march from Kharga. Browne\r\npassed through the depression from north to south, visiting Kharga,\r\nBulaq, Beris, and Maks, whence he followed the usual route to\r\nShebb and Selîma. Like his predecessor, he makes no mention of\r\nthe antiquities.\r\n\r\nCailliaud, a young French mineralogist, explored Kharga in 1818,\r\nand to him we owe the earliest published detailed descriptions\r\nand illustrations of the chief antiquities of the oasis. As the\r\nexistence of important monuments in the oasis was at that time quite\r\nunsuspected, Cailliaud’s work attracted considerable attention,\r\nand his drawings and descriptions were purchased and published\r\nby the French Government and dedicated to the King. Cailliaud set\r\nout from Esna in the Nile Valley and crossed the Libyan plateau to\r\nthe village of Jaja. After visiting the most southerly villages of\r\nDush and Beris, he journeyed northwards to Kharga, then, as now,\r\nthe chief village, whence, on the completion of his researches, he\r\nreturned to Farshut on the Nile, via Dêr el Ghennîma and the Wadi\r\nSamhûd. Cailliaud’s observations are almost entirely confined\r\nto the archæology of the oasis, and his writings yield little\r\ninformation regarding the villages, wells, and cultivated lands.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier Drovetti, French Consul-General in Egypt, visited\r\nKharga the same year as Monsieur Cailliaud. He started from Beniâdi,\r\nfollowing the Derb el Arbaîn caravan route southwards, and entered\r\nthe depression at the northern extremity. Drovetti traversed the\r\noasis from north to south, and proceeded thence to Dongola. Later,\r\non his return journey, he crossed the depression in the opposite\r\ndirection, eventually returning to the Nile Valley by way of the\r\noasis of Dakhla and the Derb el Tawîl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PASS INTO THE OASIS.]\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Cailliaud again passed through Kharga. He had explored\r\nthe oasis of Siwa the previous year, whence he travelled, via\r\nBaharia and Farafra, to Dakhla, and thence past Ain Amûr to Kharga\r\nvillage. On this occasion no further researches were undertaken in\r\nthe depression.\r\n\r\nSir Archibald Edmonstone, Bart., accompanied by two friends, visited\r\nDakhla and Kharga in 1819, and constructed a rough but fairly\r\naccurate map, showing the relative position of the two oases,\r\nwith their bounding escarpments and principal villages. Their\r\nsituation in the Libyan Desert, with regard to the Nile Valley,\r\nis, however, greatly in error, being shown fully a degree too far\r\nwest and nearly half a degree too far north. Edmonstone followed\r\nthe Derb el Tawîl route from Beniâdi in the Nile Valley to the\r\nvillage of Belat in Dakhla, returning by the Ain Amûr road to\r\nKharga, and thence to Farshut. The major portion of the account\r\nof his travels refers to Dakhla, of which oasis he must, indeed,\r\nbe regarded as the modern discoverer.\r\n\r\nHoskins explored Kharga in 1835, and published a most valuable\r\nand engaging account of his travels a couple of years later. This\r\nwork, entitled ‘Visit to the Great Oasis of the Libyan Desert,’\r\ncontains a number of illustrations depicting the scenery, the chief\r\nmonuments and their hieroglyphics, etc., made from original drawings\r\nand paper casts. Many of the inscriptions are given in full, both\r\nin the original and translated into English, and the work of all\r\nprevious writers and explorers is carefully summarized. In some cases\r\nI have verified the accuracy of Hoskins’ drawings by comparing\r\nthem with photographs taken from the same points, and have been\r\nmuch struck with the insignificant amount of decay which some of\r\nthe buildings have undergone during the course of over seventy years.\r\n\r\nRizagat, near Thebes, was Hoskins’ starting-point, and he entered\r\nthe depression by the Bulaq pass, crossing the oasis-floor to the\r\neminence known as El Gorn el Gennâh. Surveying the oasis from\r\nthis point of vantage, Hoskins remarks that the attractions of the\r\ncultivated portions of the depression, those\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Tufted isles that verdant rise amid the Libyan waste,”\r\n\r\n\r\nare apt to be exaggerated, owing to their great contrast to the\r\nsurrounding deserts. “The fair appearance then of this oasis is\r\nin a great measure fictitious; and has chiefly its origin in the\r\nrelief afforded to the mind, wearied by the monotony and dreariness\r\nof the surrounding wastes. It seems to me therefore, that the only\r\nrational way of accounting for the exaggerated epithets which the\r\nancient writers and some modern travellers have applied to this\r\ndistrict, is to attribute them to their surprise, at finding in\r\nsuch a fearful region any verdure, any habitable spot, and to the\r\nexhilarating effect on the spirits of this agreeable contrast to\r\nthe dreary deserts which they have just crossed. But comfortless as\r\nwas my journey through the wilderness, and beautiful as the woods of\r\npalm-trees, doums, and acacias in the Oasis certainly are, still the\r\nvivid recollection of the superior loveliness of the banks of the\r\nNile, prevents my consenting to call these regions ‘the Gardens\r\nof the Hesperides’; and sadly must the oasis have diminished in\r\nbeauty, if it ever merited the praise which Herodotus bestowed upon\r\nthe place, in calling it ‘the Island of the Blessed.’”\r\n\r\nHoskins, who was accompanied by two other Englishmen, made splendid\r\nuse of the fortnight spent in the oasis, although unfortunately, just\r\nbefore the termination of his visit, he sustained a violent attack\r\nof fever. Their departure is thus described: “After ascending\r\nthe mountain which bounds the Oasis, we lingered some time at the\r\nsummit, to take, I may certainly say, our last view of the place;\r\nfor having, as the Arabs say, got all its antiquities on paper,\r\nand having providentially once escaped its pestilential atmosphere,\r\nwe shall never, I think, by any possibility, have the slightest\r\ninclination to revisit such a baneful region.”\r\n\r\nMost of these early explorers found time to cut their names on\r\nthe walls of the temple of Hibis, and Cailliaud must have spent\r\nhours in this occupation, as he has left a long and neatly executed\r\ninscription recording himself as the original and genuine discoverer\r\nof that noble edifice. The names of these explorers, who in some\r\ncases suffered considerable hardships in visiting the oases, are,\r\nhowever, quite overshadowed by the numberless scrawls made in\r\nrecent years by a host of otherwise unknown petty officials of the\r\nGovernment, who have had to take their turn of duty and banishment\r\nin the greatly dreaded desert. The dated names cut in the walls of\r\nthe temple are of some value, as an examination of them frequently\r\nyields reliable evidence of the rate of weathering of the stone\r\nsince the time at which they were inscribed.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the winter of 1873-74, when the great German\r\nexpedition, under the leadership of Rohlfs, with Zittel, Jordan,\r\nand Ascherson as geologist, topographer, and botanist respectively,\r\nvisited all the chief oases of the eastern portion of the Libyan\r\nDesert, that any connected scientific observations of importance,\r\nother than those dealing with archæology, were published. The Rohlfs\r\nexpedition astronomically determined the positions of selected\r\npoints in each oasis, and produced a map on which the principal\r\nvillages and the approximate limits of the depressions were correctly\r\nshown. Zittel at the same time worked out the general relations of\r\nthe different geological formations found in the country, described\r\ntheir main divisions, and indicated approximately the areas occupied\r\nby them. So thoroughly, indeed, did this expedition accomplish its\r\nmission that its results have formed a sound basis for all later\r\nscientific work in this part of Egypt.\r\n\r\nAs the voluminous memoirs recording the observations of the members\r\nof the Rohlfs expedition are easily obtainable at the present day,\r\nit is unnecessary here to do more than briefly refer to a few of\r\ntheir more general remarks on the oasis of Kharga. In his ‘Three\r\nMonths in the Libyan Desert,’ Gerhard Rohlfs states that he and\r\nhis companions travelled from Dakhla Oasis by the Ain Amûr road,\r\nand were greeted at Kharga village by Schweinfurth, who was for the\r\ntime being residing in a disused alum factory. Rohlfs spent only\r\ntwo or three days in the neighbourhood of Kharga, and remarks that\r\nthe expedition did not undertake detailed work on the antiquities,\r\nas the latter had already been so competently described by Hoskins\r\nand other previous explorers; a few corrections and amendments of\r\npublished accounts of the temple were, however, made. The splendid\r\npreservation of the Christian necropolis, with its mausolea of\r\nunburnt brick, is remarked upon, and Rohlfs adds that, in beauty\r\nand ingenious arrangement, this burial-ground can only be excelled\r\nby the necropolis of Cyrene.\r\n\r\nRohlfs describes Kharga village as being pretty from a distance, but\r\nremarks that the narrow dirty alleys are the pictures of laziness\r\nand poverty; the streets are covered in for protection against the\r\nrays of the sun, a common practice throughout the Sahara.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘oasis’ is old Egyptian, as also is the Arabic\r\n‘wah,’ the latter word being also found in Coptic, and signifying\r\nan inhabited place; nevertheless, the word ‘wah’ was never used\r\nby the ancient Egyptians to designate the oases. These they called\r\n‘otu,’ which means a place where bodies are embalmed. ‘Otu’\r\nhas its origin in the Theban myth, according to which Seth, the\r\nmurderer of Osiris, was pursued by Horus to Koptos, where he was\r\ncaptured and thrown into a dungeon. His corpse was afterwards\r\nfound by his friends, and taken to the oases for burial.[1] The\r\ninscriptions on the temple of Hibis in Kharga refer to the oases\r\nunder the comprehensive name ‘Set-ament,’ the ‘Western\r\nLands.’\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Dr. Schweinfurth, whose services to Egypt in\r\nso many branches of science stand pre-eminent, published important\r\ncontributions on some of the archæological remains. Two or three\r\nyears later Brugsch Bey brought out an account of the antiquities\r\nof the oasis, with translations of a number of the inscriptions on\r\nthe temples of Nadûra and Hibis. The antiquities will be briefly\r\nreferred to in my account of the history of the oasis under the\r\nPersians and the Romans, and for fuller details the reader is\r\nreferred to the publications of Cailliaud, Hoskins, Schweinfurth,\r\nBrugsch, and some still later writers.\r\n\r\nIn 1893-94 Captain H. G. Lyons, R.E., in the course of a military\r\npatrol, undertaken in order to ascertain the measures necessary\r\nto protect the inhabitants of the oasis from possible Dervish\r\nraids, made valuable geological observations on the Eocene and\r\nCretaceous systems, especially in relation to the connection of\r\nfolding and water-supply. These he discussed in a paper read before\r\nthe Geological Society of London in 1894, and it was mainly due to\r\nthe interest it aroused, and to his initiative in pointing out to\r\nthe Egyptian authorities the importance of having a comprehensive\r\nexamination of the country carried out, that the Geological Survey\r\nof Egypt was established in 1896.\r\n\r\nThe detailed survey of the Libyan Desert was taken up in October,\r\n1897, and completed in June of the following year, the four\r\noases being mapped on the scale of 1 to 50,000 by plane-table\r\ntriangulation, checked and adjusted by numerous astronomical\r\nobservations. Direct measurements by measuring-wheel were also\r\nemployed to a considerable extent. Baharia Oasis was the first to be\r\ntaken in hand, Mr. Leonard Gorringe and I taking the western side,\r\nand my colleagues, Messrs. Ball and Vuta, the eastern. This plan of\r\nsplitting up an oasis-depression between two surveying parties was\r\nnot, however, found satisfactory, and on the completion of Baharia\r\nit was decided that Ball should take up the oasis of Kharga, while\r\nFarafra and Dakhla fell to my lot. The results of this survey are\r\npublished in the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Egypt.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three years I have been fortunate in having had\r\nopportunities of studying in some detail the topography, geology, and\r\nwater-supply of the oasis of Kharga. This detailed examination has\r\nenabled me to revise and amplify pioneer work, and has, in certain\r\ninstances, forced me to differ from the opinions expressed by my\r\npredecessors in the same field, views which, in the light of the\r\nevidence available at the time, were doubtless well justified. In\r\nthe same way may future research necessitate the modification or\r\nalteration of the conclusions herein expressed, and for many years\r\nto come the region of the oases will offer a vast field for further\r\nscientific work.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this brief account of the literature on the oasis\r\nof Kharga, I should like to take the opportunity of expressing my\r\nhigh appreciation of the energy and purpose of my former colleague,\r\nDr. John Ball, who, in spite of the many hardships and difficulties\r\ninseparable from scientific work in the Libyan Desert, in such a\r\nshort time accomplished so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                    THE ROADS LEADING TO THE OASIS\r\n\r\n\r\nLines of Communication between the Nile Valley, Kharga, and Dakhla\r\nOasis — Principal Passes out of the Oasis — Ascent to Plateau\r\nwith Caravans — Main Roads to Assiut, Sohag, Karnak, Esna, and\r\nEdfu — Nature of intervening Plateau — Ghubbâri Road to Dakhla\r\n— The Upper or Ain Amûr Road — The Railway between the Nile\r\nValley and the Oasis — Nature of Desert Roads — The Bedawin\r\nArabs — Cross-Country Traverses as the Crow flies — Traverse\r\nfrom Farafra to Assiut — Rate of Travelling with Camels.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oasis of Kharga is in communication with Dakhla to the west,\r\nand with the Nile Valley to the east, by a number of caravan\r\nroutes, the most frequented of which connect directly with the two\r\nvillages Kharga and Beris, in the north and south of the depression\r\nrespectively. Formerly, everyone bound for the oasis was compelled\r\nto undertake a four or five days’ journey along one or other of\r\nthese routes, and although nowadays most persons will elect to\r\ncross the plateau by train, a description of the oasis would be\r\nincomplete without some reference to the desert roads.[2]\r\n\r\nThe depression is for the most part bounded by steep and lofty\r\nescarpments, quite inaccessible to camels, except at a few points\r\nwhere the gradients are less severe, and the loose blocks of rock\r\nand other cliff débris have been removed. The principal passes\r\nup the eastern scarp of the oasis are seven in number, the most\r\nnortherly, known as El Ramlia, being in the extreme north-east\r\ncorner of the depression. Thirteen kilometres south of this is El\r\nYabsa pass. The next is the Refûf, at the head of the gully 45\r\nkilometres north-east of Kharga village. A little farther south,\r\neast of the old Roman fort near the foot of Jebel Ghennîma, one of\r\nthe two prominent outliers of the eastern plateau, is the pass of\r\nAbu Sighawâl, and 35 kilometres to the south is the Nagab Bulaq,\r\nN.N.E. of the village of Bulaq. In the south end of the oasis there\r\nare passes to the north-east of Jaja, and N.N.E. of Dush. These\r\nseven passes are the main exits from the depression on the east\r\nside, though there are several other little-used routes, up which\r\nlightly laden camels can be taken, for instance, near Jebel Um el\r\nGhennaim. The illustration showing the descent to the depression was,\r\nin fact, taken at one of the latter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the roads ascend the escarpments at the best available\r\npoints, in some cases taking advantage of the easier gradients of\r\nthe extensive cake-like masses of calcareous tufa, which in places\r\nhave been deposited over the face of the original cliffs, their\r\nascent with heavily laden camels may at times become somewhat of an\r\nundertaking. The paths are frequently rough, and the difference in\r\nheight between the foot of the scarp and the plateau is usually\r\nbetween 200 and 300 metres. The pack-saddles should always be\r\ncarefully adjusted and secured by ropes passing round the base of\r\nthe neck or below the butt of the tail, according to whether the\r\ncaravan is making the ascent or descent; otherwise the loads are\r\nlikely to slip off, and the restricted limits of a steep path,\r\nin the middle of a train of camels, is not an ideal place for\r\ntheir readjustment. In hot weather the ascent to the plateau,\r\nthough perhaps occupying only one or one and a half hours, will\r\ntake as much out of the pack-animals as a whole day’s march. I\r\nexperienced no little trouble on one occasion when returning to\r\nthe valley after some months’ survey work in Dakhla Oasis. After\r\nhalting one day at Kharga village, we proceeded on our way to Esna\r\nby the Bulaq pass. It was hot weather, towards the end of May, and\r\nthe ascent of the pass tired our camels, naturally not in the pink of\r\ncondition, to such an extent that Gorringe and I had some difficulty\r\nin getting them across the plateau to the valley. In summer-time it\r\nis always advisable to negotiate this part of the journey in the\r\nearly morning or late in the evening, unless the heavier portion\r\nof the baggage can be sent in advance to the top of the scarp,\r\nand the animals taken back and watered at the nearest well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CARAVAN ROUTES\r\nTO THE\r\nOASIS OF KHARGA]\r\n\r\nThe main roads from the oasis run to Assiut, Kawâmil near Sohag,\r\nWaled Hallaf near Girga, Karnak near Farshut, and to Rizagat, Esna,\r\nand Edfu, and their disposition may be seen on the accompanying plan.\r\n\r\nThe Assiut road, after leaving Kharga village, passes the hamlet of\r\nMeheriq and follows the line of wells to Ain el Ghazâl, which is\r\nthe last place at which water-skins and tanks can be filled. From\r\nAin el Ghazâl the most direct route ascends to the plateau by\r\nthe Ramlia pass in the extreme corner of the depression, but the\r\nYabsa exit is recommended as easier and very little longer. After\r\ncrossing a tract of country with an abominably rough surface,\r\nthe two tracks unite a few kilometres north of the depression,\r\nand about a day’s march farther on the Zarâbi road takes off on\r\nthe right. The main road proceeds direct to Assiut, descending the\r\nscarp about 8 kilometres before the town is reached, a by-path to\r\nthe little village of Dronka having branched off beforehand.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of El Yabsa a separate road proceeds direct to El\r\nGhennaim, a village on the edge of the desert to the north-west\r\nof Tahta. By these roads the distances from Kharga village to\r\nAssiut, Zarâbi, and El Ghennaim, are 210, 200, and 180 kilometres\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nEl Refûf, the pass by which the Sohag (Kawâmil) road leaves the\r\ndepression, is situated at the head of a gully, and offers an easy\r\nascent to the plateau. A few kilometres beyond, the road passes to\r\nthe north of El Shugera, a prominent detached block perched on end\r\nat the foot of the southern slope of a small limestone range. The\r\nroad runs in a fairly steady direction 40 degrees north of east,\r\nstriking the Nile Valley scarp 15 kilometres before Kawâmil, on\r\nthe edge of the cultivated lands, is reached. About 33 kilometres\r\nbefore reaching the scarp a branch takes off and runs nearly due\r\nnorth to Guhêna, south of Tahta; this branch is, in fact, usually\r\nreferred to as the Tahta road.\r\n\r\nIf the traveller, after leaving the Refûf pass, keeps to the south\r\nof El Shugera, he will find a branch road leading to El Tundaba,\r\na deep shaft in the centre of the plateau, at kilometre No. 92\r\non the railway; a little farther east this track strikes the\r\nmain road from the Abu Sighawâl pass. The shaft is sunk through\r\na thick deposit of silt, which has filled a local depression in\r\nthe plateau to some depth. The silt must be regarded as rain-wash\r\nfrom the surrounding country, possibly deposited in the time of\r\nprehistoric man. Flint implements are to be found scattered about,\r\nand from the presence of pottery and graves it would seem that the\r\nplace had been inhabited in comparatively modern times. The pit was\r\nevidently sunk for water, although at the present time it is quite\r\ndry; given, however, a heavy thunderstorm within the catchment-basin,\r\ndrainage-water would in all probability find its way to the bottom\r\nof the deposit, where it would be held up by the limestone, and\r\nmight form a supply lasting possibly for many years.\r\n\r\nThe road leaving the depression by the Abu Sighawâl pass, and\r\nleading to villages in the neighbourhood of Girga and Farshut,\r\nis reckoned the best and shortest route between Kharga and the\r\nNile Valley, and, by making a very short détour, caravans have\r\nthe advantage of being able to water at the old Roman fort at\r\nthe base of Jebel Ghennîma, 27 kilometres after leaving the\r\nvillage. The ascent of the pass was formerly very rough going,\r\nbut a good road with an easy gradient has recently been cut for\r\nthe transport of heavy boring machinery into the oasis. From the\r\ntop of the Abu Sighawâl pass a well-marked track crosses to El\r\nRefûf and connects with the Sohag road, and care has to be taken\r\nby travellers for Waled Hallaf, El Elwania and Karnak not to make\r\nthe initial mistake of getting on to this track.\r\n\r\nFor the first few kilometres the main road from Abu Sighawâl runs\r\nvery straight over a level plain, on which fossil sea-urchins are\r\nso abundant as to attract the attention of the most casual observer;\r\nit then ascends a low escarpment, the Nagab el Jellab. The somewhat\r\nrough limestone country beyond is known as the Mishâbit, and then El\r\nBotîkh, with its countless millions of spherical chert concretions,\r\nis crossed. Beyond El Botîkh the road passes an isolated limestone\r\nhill called El Mograbi, where tradition has it that a Mograbi\r\nArab from the west and his stolen oasis bride were overtaken and\r\ndecapitated by the Kharga people. A little farther to the east there\r\nis a bifurcation, but the branches soon rejoin, and after passing El\r\nMasaâd the plain is fairly level, though covered with very angular\r\nblocks of crystalline limestone and cherty concretions. Farther on\r\nare the rocks of El Buraig, where large quantities of broken pottery\r\nindicate the site of one of the many water-stations maintained\r\nby the Romans along this road. Garat el Melh is so called from\r\nthe occurrence of salt in the limestones of this locality. A few\r\nkilometres to the east of Garat el Melh the road passes El Suâga,\r\nan artificial heap of stones to which every self-respecting Bedawi\r\nis careful to contribute; and a couple of hours beyond, a fairly\r\nconspicuous limestone hill, called Garat Radwan, is reached.\r\n\r\nShortly after passing Garat Radwan the most prominent landmarks\r\nmet with on this road, in the form of two solitary crescent-shape\r\nsand-dunes, loom into sight; these are called El Ghart by the Arabs\r\nand are distant 55 kilometres from Abu Sighawâl. They form part\r\nof a belt of single isolated dunes which crosses this part of the\r\ndesert in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction. The same line of dunes\r\nis passed by the railway at kilometre No. 100, and I have observed\r\nits continuation still farther north on the Sohag road, at a point\r\n45 kilometres from the Refûf pass. These dunes mark the entrance\r\nto an area of very rough hummocky crystalline limestone known as\r\nEl Zizagat, through which the track is not easily followed. On\r\nemerging from El Zizagat the road bears slightly to the north, and\r\nis here only a few kilometres south of El Tundaba. At this point it\r\nbifurcates, the northern branch proceeding direct to Waled Hallaf\r\nnear Girga, the southern continuing over the easy level plains of El\r\nIshab to the rocks of El Baglûli, and thence past those of Dilail\r\nel Kelb to the twin hillocks of Dubîya. Beyond El Dubîya the road\r\ncrosses the shallow drainage-line of Rod el Ghanam, near the head\r\nof the Wadi Samhûd, down which it passes, and thence over the Nile\r\nValley plains past El Hamera and Hagar Hawara to Karnak and Farshut.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that at Rod el Ghanam, shortly before\r\nreaching the head of the Wadi Samhûd, a branch road takes off on\r\nthe left-hand side and descends by a separate pass to El Elwania;\r\nand here again care has to be exercised to avoid taking the wrong\r\nbranch, as the tracks cover a broad area, and the actual junction\r\nmay be easily missed.\r\n\r\nThe Kharga-Waled Hallaf road, via the Abu Sighawâl pass, is the\r\nshortest route from the oasis to the Nile Valley, the distance\r\nbeing only 160 kilometres; that to Karnak, by the Wadi Samhûd,\r\nis somewhat longer, being approximately 174 kilometres.\r\n\r\nThe next pass of importance to the south lies east of the village of\r\nBulaq, whence it takes its name. From the summit a road runs nearly\r\ndue east, meeting a second, starting from Beris and gaining the\r\nplateau by the Jaja pass, after one and a half days’ march. From\r\nthe cross-roads, ‘El Mafâriq,’ routes run direct to Farshut and\r\nRizagat. From Beris to Farshut, by the Jaja pass, the distance is\r\napproximately 224 kilometres; from Kharga, by the Bulaq pass, the\r\nroads to Farshut and Rizagat measure about 203 and 198 kilometres\r\nrespectively. Another road from Beris leaves the depression by a\r\npass to the east of the village of Dush; this bifurcates about two\r\ndays’ march from the latter, the left-hand track leading to Esna,\r\nthe right to Edfu. Other roads lead from the south end of the oasis,\r\nvia Nakhail, to Kurkur and Dungun, while the Derb el Arbaîn runs\r\nsouthwards to Selîma and thence on to the Sudan.\r\n\r\nThe road between the oasis and Assiut is best known as being the last\r\nand worst portion of the Derb el Arbaîn, or forty days’ road,\r\nwhich, starting from Darfur, was originally one of the main lines\r\nof communication between Egypt and the Sudan. It was along this\r\ndesert route that great numbers of slaves and large quantities of\r\nmerchandise, such as ivory, gum, and other products of the Sudan,\r\nwere imported into Egypt from the south. After passing the last\r\nspring in the oasis, caravans had still a little over 200 kilometres\r\nto cover before reaching the Nile Valley, with a steep ascent to\r\nthe plateau at the outset, and thence for a considerable distance\r\nover the very worst surface imaginable—loose sand full of sharp\r\nangular blocks and fragments of flint and cherty limestone. Little\r\nwonder that, overladen and fatigued by the long distance already\r\ncovered, the camels died in great numbers on this last stretch of\r\nroad. Along most desert routes the dried bones of camels are of\r\nfairly frequent occurrence, but on the Derb el Arbaîn, between\r\nKharga and Assiut, the skeletons of these poor beasts are met\r\nwith in groups of tens and twenties, and must number hundreds and\r\nthousands. In many instances the skeleton still lies undisturbed,\r\nin the position assumed by the luckless animal in its death agony,\r\nthe long neck curved back by muscular contraction so that the skull\r\nlies in contact with the spine. When one sees these remains, half\r\nburied in the sand, the bones bleached snow-white by a pitiless\r\nsun, with still adhering fragments of skin and muscle dried hard\r\nas adamant, one cannot but feel pity for those patient ‘ships of\r\nthe desert,’ wrecked almost within sight of port.\r\n\r\nCailliaud, in 1817, observed the arrival at Assiut of a large\r\ncaravan from Darfur, consisting of 16,000 individuals. It included\r\n6,000 slaves—men, women, and children. He remarks: “They had\r\nbeen two months travelling in the deserts, in the most intense heat\r\nof the year; meagre, exhausted, and the aspect of death on their\r\ncountenances, the spectacle strongly excited compassion.”\r\n\r\nThe actual width of the plateau varies from 120 kilometres between\r\nAbu Sighawâl and the scarp above Waled Hallaf, to 200 kilometres\r\nbetween Beris and Esna. The maximum elevation above sea-level\r\nis about 550 metres on the latitude of Esna, and on the whole\r\nthe plateau has a fairly general slope to the north. As already\r\nmentioned, several distinct types of country, depending on the nature\r\nof the rocks constituting the surface strata, are met with. Smooth,\r\nhard, level plains, formed of a superficial layer of weathered\r\nlimestone covered by a brown veneer of insoluble flint and cherty\r\nfragments, alternate with bare rugged rock desert of hummocky\r\nlimestone. The sombre level or gently undulating flint-covered\r\nplains, frequently spoken of as ‘serir’ by the Arabs, have\r\nideal surfaces for travelling; the light-coloured hummocky country,\r\noften called ‘kharafish,’ is in its most developed form made\r\nup of innumerable elongated hillocks, every portion of the exposed\r\nrock-surfaces being deeply scored; the furrows are separated by\r\nupstanding edges, often so sharp and knife-like as to be capable\r\nof injuring the feet of man and beast. The hillocks are separated\r\nby deep troughs half buried in drift-sand, all lying parallel,\r\nin the direction of the prevailing winds, so that progress in a\r\nlatitudinal direction through this type of desert is a slow and\r\ntedious undertaking. Both types of country are equally desolate and\r\nbarren, scrub of any description being of the rarest occurrence,\r\nexcept after local thunderstorms. Another type of country, to which\r\nwe have already briefly alluded, is the curious desert-surface called\r\nEl Botîkh (the water-melons), which results from the weathering\r\nof certain bands of the Lower Eocene formation containing numbers\r\nof large globular concretions; these, it may be mentioned, often\r\nlie so thickly strewn on the surface as to actually obstruct the\r\npassing caravan.\r\n\r\nKharga is connected with the oasis of Dakhla to the west by two\r\nroads, the lower and more southerly, known as the Derb el Ghubbâri,\r\nbeing the one most frequently used. This road, by taking a wide\r\nsweep to the south, avoids the intervening plateau altogether,\r\nso that the fatiguing ascent and descent are avoided. After\r\nleaving Kharga village the route leads past a group of wells,\r\nknown as Ain Khenâfish, distant some 6 kilometres; thence it lies\r\nover wide-stretching plains of sandstone, leading up to the more\r\nbroken country formed by the foot-hills of the towering plateau,\r\nwhich is always plainly visible on the north side of the road. The\r\ndistance to Tenîda, the most easterly of the Dakhla villages,\r\nis 143 kilometres by the Derb el Ghubbâri.\r\n\r\nThe alternative route by way of Ain Amûr is appreciably shorter,\r\nthough, owing to the extra time involved in negotiating the steep\r\npasses to and from the plateau, there is little saving in time when\r\ntravelling with a heavily-laden caravan. Compared with the lower\r\nroad, however, this route is much more interesting and picturesque,\r\nand the presence of water at Ain Amûr, about half-way between the\r\ntwo oases, is a distinct advantage. The road from Kharga village\r\nlies over a broad plain, whose only features are occasional conical\r\nhills of dark ferruginous sandstone. It follows a W.N.W. direction,\r\nheading for the great indentation to the west of the Jebel Tarif\r\nrange. After getting well into the recess, but when still some 15\r\nkilometres from its head, the road turns abruptly to the south,\r\nand winds its way up an escarpment littered with huge blocks of\r\ntufaceous limestone. Perched near the summit of the cliffs stands\r\nthe solitary palm which marks the site of the water-hole, in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of which grows a fair amount of prickly\r\nscrub. The remains of mud-brick buildings and a stone temple show\r\nthat this place was formerly inhabited, and of some importance.\r\n\r\nThe ascent to the plateau from Ain Amûr needs care with laden\r\ncamels. The road proceeds up a narrow defile, the actual track being\r\nvery rough, and so confined that in places the packs are liable to\r\nbe dragged off by the rocks on either side. Once on the plateau the\r\ngoing becomes first rate, the freedom of the surface from blown sand\r\nbeing very noticeable. This is due to the isolation of this portion\r\nof the plateau-massif, which is cut off from the main mass to the\r\nnorth by the deep recess, and is bounded by a low-lying plain to\r\nthe south. After a distance of 33 kilometres has been traversed the\r\nroad descends into a narrow valley opening on to the low country\r\nto the south, and proceeds in a westerly direction to Tenîda. The\r\ndistance from Kharga to Tenîda by this route is 128 kilometres.\r\n\r\nIt is possible on leaving Ain Amûr to cross to the top of the\r\nindentation, and thence to proceed across the plateau almost due\r\nwest, striking the road from Assiut, known as the Derb el Tawîl, at\r\nthe top of the pass 25 kilometres from the village of Belat. There\r\nis, however, no track, and the surface is covered with parallel\r\nnorth and south ridges of rock, the crossing of which is extremely\r\nwearisome. Both near the head of the Ain Amûr recess and in the\r\nextreme north-west corner of the oasis very old tracks trending in\r\nwesterly and northwesterly directions are observable, and although\r\nunused at the present day, these may mark the positions of formerly\r\nfrequented routes leading to the oasis of Farafra. At the present\r\ntime that oasis is not in direct communication with Kharga, the\r\nroutes used being from Manfalut in the Nile Valley, from Qasr Dakhl\r\nin the oasis of Dakhla, and from Ain el Hais in Baharia.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of roads we must briefly refer to\r\nthe route taken by the railway. The line, which has a gauge of 75\r\ncentimetres, was built by the Corporation of Western Egypt, Limited,\r\nto develop their concessions in the oasis. It commences at Mouaslet\r\nel Kharga, a new station on the Egyptian State Railway near Farshut,\r\nand crosses to the border of the desert, a few kilometres distant, by\r\nway of one of the embankments separating two of the great irrigation\r\nbasins of Upper Egypt. At the edge of the desert is the station\r\nof El Qara, the point of departure for the oasis. After skirting\r\nthe margin of the Nile Valley cultivation for a short distance it\r\nheads straight for the Wadi Samhûd, by means of which the plateau\r\nis gained without encountering any very heavy gradients. From the top\r\nof the Wadi Samhûd the line follows the Abu Sighawâl road for about\r\n40 kilometres, after which it diverges a few degrees and proceeds to\r\nEl Tundaba, the shaft already described, 92 kilometres from Mouaslet\r\nel Kharga. From El Tundaba the railway follows more or less closely\r\nthe cross-track, sometimes called the Derb el Refûf, which joins\r\nthe Sohag road at El Shugera, and, entering the depression by the\r\nRefûf pass, follows down the gully, and thence across the plain to\r\nthe station of Meheriq. From Meheriq it proceeds nearly due south\r\nto the Corporation’s headquarters, and thence on to its present\r\nterminus a few kilometres from Kharga village.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAILWAY DESCENDING INTO THE OASIS.]\r\n\r\nMy friend Ball lays great stress on the tortuous nature of the roads\r\nbetween the oasis and the valley, and recommends the scientific\r\ntraveller to steer an independent course. But after traversing\r\nthe majority of the main caravan roads, and with a fairly intimate\r\nknowledge of the characters of the intervening areas, I must say\r\nthat, in my opinion, it would be difficult to better them. These\r\nroads were not laid out yesterday, but result from the accumulated\r\nexperience of centuries. The original tracks may have been tortuous\r\nenough, but they have become straightened out by the cutting off of\r\ncorners here and there, until at the present day the roads fulfil\r\nthe three most important objects in view—the ascent and descent to\r\nand from the plateau at the points offering the easiest gradients,\r\nand the crossing of the plateau itself as directly as possible over\r\nthe smoothest and most level ground available. The roads give a wide\r\nberth to the outcrops of rough limestone, and anyone who has done\r\nmuch cross-country travelling in the Libyan Desert will appreciate\r\ntheir doing so.\r\n\r\nNor can I concur with the same author in his opinion that the Bedawin\r\nof this side of the Nile have a poor knowledge of their beloved\r\ndesert. It is certainly true that the Arab does, for very good\r\nreasons, prefer to travel on the beaten tracks rather than undertake\r\nexploratory missions as the crow flies, his main object being to get\r\nto his destination as rapidly and easily as possible. If by chance,\r\nhowever, rain should fall on any portion of the desert, the Arab\r\nwill very shortly be found there, taking full advantage of what\r\nAllah has provided in the way of free grazing for his herds. My own\r\nexperience has been that the Arabs have among them a fair proportion\r\nof men with an extensive knowledge of the western desert, and I have\r\nfrequently been struck by their wonderful knowledge of the roads and\r\nthe facility with which many of them can follow the tracks on the\r\nblackest of nights, as even in broad daylight the landmarks which\r\na European could recognize on second acquaintance are few and far\r\nbetween. The average Bedawi cannot be said to have exceptionally\r\nlong sight, but he is frequently possessed of a wonderful sense\r\nof direction.\r\n\r\nTravellers in the Egyptian deserts are apt to underrate\r\nthe intelligence of the Bedawin, owing to the fact that they\r\nunconsciously form their impressions from the miserable specimens\r\nof humanity so frequently sent out by the actual owners of the\r\ncamels to act as drivers and attendants to a hired caravan. In such\r\ncaravans there is seldom more than one man who knows the particular\r\nroads to be followed; the rest are wretched underfed creatures,\r\ngenerally half-breeds, who for a mere pittance tramp day after day,\r\nuncomplainingly and shoeless, alongside the caravan. They are much\r\nto be pitied, and it would be as unreasonable to expect them to\r\nhave any special knowledge of the desert as it would be to look\r\nfor information regarding, say, the mountains of Wales among the\r\npoorer classes of a Welsh town.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to minimize the value of cross-country traverses\r\ncarried out with special scientific objects; they are, indeed,\r\noften necessary for topographical and geological purposes. I\r\nwould, however, warn the enthusiastic tyro that, in the Libyan\r\nDesert, travelling as the crow flies is not always so simple and\r\nglorious an affair as it may seem when planning expeditions from\r\na comfortable arm-chair; and if his object is to get a short\r\ncut he will probably have reason to bitterly regret the moment\r\nhe left the beaten track. I have in mind more than one instance\r\nwhere mistakes of this kind have been made, mistakes which might\r\neasily have led to disastrous consequences. In long cross-country\r\ntraverses an error in steering of only two or three degrees will in\r\na few marches throw a caravan many kilometres out of its course,\r\nand guiding camels over rough country by compass is by no means\r\nan easy undertaking. Moreover, easily distinguishable landmarks\r\nare rare, and the desert plains over wide areas maintain remarkably\r\npersistent characteristics. Quite recently I recollect an Englishman,\r\nwhose Arab attendant had become suddenly incapacitated by an attack\r\nof fever or sunstroke, getting hopelessly astray between the edge\r\nof the plateau overlooking the oasis and rail-head, which was then\r\nonly 20 or 30 kilometres distant, in consequence of his missing\r\nthe bifurcation of the road at El Shugera, and proceeding, owing\r\nto this mistake, along the route leading to Sohag.\r\n\r\nAlong the caravan roads the sharp fragments of rock have been stamped\r\nunderground or kicked to one side, but elsewhere they usually litter\r\nthe surface, and are very trying to camels, whose pads, though\r\nsoft and yielding, are easily worn by much travelling over rough\r\ncountry. This has more than once been painfully impressed upon me by\r\nthe antics of my own riding camel, whose mode of progression at such\r\ntimes resembled more the dance of a fanatic on red-hot coals than the\r\nordinary gait of a well-bred ‘hegîn.’ Over some areas, however,\r\none can travel in a straight line without let or hindrance, and in\r\nsuch cases it is only necessary to lay out the course correctly in\r\nthe first instance, and to have the courage of one’s opinion to\r\nstick to that course until the destination is reached. One must\r\nnot heed the remonstrances of the less sporting members of the\r\nexpedition, who will lose no opportunity of predicting disaster,\r\nand in this respect the new chum fresh out from home is generally\r\nthe greatest offender.\r\n\r\nOne of the longest cross-country traverses I myself have undertaken\r\nin the Libyan Desert was from Farafra Oasis to Assiut. The only\r\nroad between that oasis and the Nile Valley strikes the latter\r\nnear El Qusîya, midway between the towns Manfalut and Derut, so\r\nthat travellers who wish to make Assiut have an additional day’s\r\nmarch southwards alongside the margin of the cultivated lands. On\r\ngaining the summit of the pass above Bir Murr, on the east side\r\nof the Farafra depression, I abandoned the road and set a course\r\ndirect for Assiut, steering and plotting my route by compass and\r\nplane-table, the distance being reckoned by measuring-wheel. The\r\nmost satisfactory method of procedure on desert traverses is to lay\r\nout a line, representing the correct bearing of the destination,\r\nalong the centre of the longer axis of the plane-table, and then\r\nto steer to any well-marked object lying on either side, but within\r\nreasonable distance, of the proper course. At every station the exact\r\nposition reached is plotted, and steps are taken, when selecting\r\nthe next point on which to march, to converge towards the correct\r\ncourse marked down the centre of the table.\r\n\r\nOn this particular traverse I was unaccompanied by Europeans or\r\nBedawin, my camel drivers being fellahin from the Nile Valley. The\r\nsurface proved excellent going, and the Abu Mohariq belt of dunes,\r\n190 kilometres from Qasr Farafra, was crossed without trouble. Eight\r\ndays after leaving Farafra village we struck the escarpment of\r\nthe Nile Valley, having covered nearly 300 kilometres, and found\r\nwe were marching on a point only very little to one side of the\r\ntown of Assiut. From this traverse it was possible to calculate\r\nthe longitude of Farafra with fair accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe normal rate of travelling of camels carrying ordinary loads\r\nweighing from three to four hundred-weight is 4 kilometres, or\r\nabout 2½ miles, an hour, ten hours being the usual day’s march\r\nof caravans when accompanied by Europeans. The native caravans,\r\ncarrying dates and other heavy merchandise, usually traverse\r\nthe plateau in three days and nights, doing stages of 60 to 70\r\nkilometres at a stretch. By travelling very light with trotting\r\ncamels I have, on more than one occasion, crossed from the oasis\r\nto the valley in between thirty and thirty-five hours, doing from\r\n180 to 190 kilometres in two stages of about twelve hours each,\r\nwith one stop only of nine or ten hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                        TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nDimensions of the Oasis-Depression — Jebel Têr, Jebel Tarif,\r\nand other Hills within the Depression — Aspect of the Oasis from\r\nthe surrounding Escarpments — Geological Sequence — Nature and\r\nThickness of the Strata — Geological History of the Oasis —\r\nFormation of the Depression — Difference of Level of Strata on\r\neither side of the Depression — The Great Longitudinal Flexure\r\n— Height of the Floor compared with Sea-Level — Altitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nKharga, the eastern of the two southern oases, is a depression lying\r\nwith its longer axis north and south, mostly bounded by steep and\r\nlofty escarpments, but open to the south and south-west, on which\r\nsides the country rises gradually from the floor of the oasis. The\r\nextreme length of the depression, from the northern wall to Jebel\r\nAbu Bayan, which for convenience may be regarded as the southern\r\nlimit of the oasis proper, is 185 kilometres, or 115 miles. The\r\ngeneral trend of the eastern escarpment is nearly due north and\r\nsouth, but that on the west is very irregular, while to the south\r\nand south-west there is no definite boundary. The breadth of the\r\ndepression may therefore be said to vary from 20 to 80 kilometres.\r\n\r\nThe ranges of Jebel Têr and Jebel Tarif form isolated hill-massifs\r\nin the centre of the northern part of the depression, while Jebel\r\nGhennîma and Jebel Um el Ghennaim are conspicuous outliers of the\r\nplateau on the east side. With the exception of these, the floor is\r\ndestitute of anything beyond comparatively insignificant eminences,\r\nunless we include the small range of hills known as the Gorn el\r\nGennâh, to the south-east of the village of Gennâh, which is\r\nnoticeable more on account of its sharply-defined peaks than of its\r\ngeneral elevation above the surrounding country. Referring to the two\r\nconspicuous peaks, Ghennîma and Um el Ghennaim—Jimmy and Jemima,\r\nas I have heard them dubbed—reminds me that on the Survey and on\r\nsome of the older maps the names are reversed. I have questioned\r\na number of natives regarding the names of these hills, and have\r\ninvariably been informed that Ghennîma is the more northerly of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nThe villages, wells, and cultivated lands lie within a north and\r\nsouth band, occupying the lowest portion of the floor, and following\r\nthe general trend of the depression. They are, however, broken up\r\nby a broad area of barren desert into two distinct north and south\r\ngroups, of which Kharga and Beris villages are the chief centres\r\nrespectively. A description of these is reserved for a later chapter.\r\n\r\nWhen a traveller, after crossing the broad monotonous plateau,\r\nat length reaches the scarp or wall of the oasis, and sees spread\r\nout before him a vast depression, stretching in some directions\r\nas far as the eye can reach, in others to the opposite bounding\r\nwalls dimly discernible on the far horizon, he can hardly refrain\r\nfrom speculating as to the causes which have given rise to such\r\nhuge hollows in the plateau. When he descends to the cultivated\r\nportions of the floor of the depression, and sees those numerous\r\nbubbling springs, which alone make life possible in the midst\r\nof this otherwise deadly wilderness, his second inquiry is as\r\nto whence comes such abundance of water in one of the most arid\r\nregions in the world. These questions are worth asking, and, so\r\nfar as the present state of our knowledge permits, it will be my\r\nendeavour to answer them. I propose, therefore, to briefly place\r\non record such information and data as I have been able to gain,\r\nbut as both topography and water-supply are intimately connected\r\nwith the geology of the district, it will be necessary at the outset\r\nto devote a few pages to a consideration of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHRISTIAN NECROPOLIS AND JEBEL TER.]\r\n\r\nThe geological deposits found in the oasis of Kharga are tabulated on\r\nthe following page, commencing with those most recently formed. The\r\nsuccession, as shown in the table, is that which obtains in\r\nthe northern part of the depression, but as far as is known the\r\nsame stages occur throughout the oasis, and do not vary either in\r\nthickness or in lithological characters to any great extent. Over\r\nlarge areas the lower-lying parts of the oasis-floor are formed of\r\nthose beds which we have designated the Surface-water Sandstone,\r\nthough in\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+----------------------------+---------+\r\n  |                        |                            |Thickness|\r\n  |  Geological System.    |          Stage.            |    in   |\r\n  |                        |                            | Metres. |\r\n  +------------------------+----------------------------+---------+\r\n  |                        |                            |         |\r\n  |                        |{Sand-Dunes                }|         |\r\n  |RECENT AND }            |{Spring Deposits (modern)  }|   Very  |\r\n  |PLEISTOCENE}            |{Lacustrine Sands and Clays}| variable|\r\n  |                        |{Calcareous Tufa           }|         |\r\n  |                        |                            |         |\r\n  |                        |                            |         |\r\n  |                        |                            |         |\r\n  |LOWER }     Lower Libyan| Plateau Limestone          |     115 |\r\n  |EOCENE}                 |                            |         |\r\n  |            Passage Beds| Esna Shales and Marls      |      55 |\r\n  |                        |                            |         |\r\n  |                        |{White Chalk               }|      70 |\r\n  |           {Danian      |{Ash-grey Shales           }|         |\r\n  |           {            |{Exogyra Beds               |      30 |\r\n  |UPPER      {            |                            |         |\r\n  |CRETACEOUS {            |{Phosphate Beds             |      70 |\r\n  |           {Campanian   |{Purple Shales              |      50 |\r\n  |           {(Nubian     |{Surface-water Sandstone    |      45 |\r\n  |           { Series)    |{Impermeable Grey Shales    |      75 |\r\n  |                        |{Artesian-water Sandstone   |     120 |\r\n  |                                                     +---------+\r\n  |            Total                                    |     630 |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+---------+\r\n\r\nplaces the still older underlying grey shales are exposed. The\r\npurple or red shales generally form the rising ground towards the\r\nescarpments, at the base of which are usually found the phosphatic\r\nbeds, with hard, pronounced bands made up of fish-remains and\r\nphosphatic nodules. Above come the Exogyra Beds, with thick bands of\r\nlimestone almost entirely composed of large oyster-shells. Rising\r\nup above these is the generally well-marked cliff of grey shales,\r\ncapped by a snow-white chalk of much the same age geologically as\r\nthe well-known chalk of the South of England. The summit of the\r\nchalk frequently forms a separate plateau, subsidiary to the high\r\ndesert tableland, and separated from it by the cliffs formed of\r\nthe massive Eocene limestones.\r\n\r\nThe total thickness of the exposed strata is about 435 metres, a\r\nfigure obtained by actual measurement. Numerous borings show the\r\nthickness of the unexposed underlying Impermeable Grey Shales to\r\nbe 75 metres, and the deepest borings yet made have pierced the\r\nstill lower Artesian-water Sandstone to a depth of 120 metres,\r\nmaking a grand total of known deposits of 630 metres, or 2,067\r\nfeet. The depth to which the water-bearing sandstone extends is at\r\npresent a matter of speculation; the point is of great importance\r\nin connection with the water-supply, though up to the present\r\nno borings of sufficient depth have been made to determine its\r\nthickness, nature, and relation to the underlying igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few isolated bosses of eruptive rock in\r\nthe desert to the south of the oasis—indications of the granitic\r\nfoundation which probably underlies the entire area—the geological\r\ndeposits of the oasis-depression, and of the surrounding escarpments\r\nand plateaux, are entirely of sedimentary origin, that is to say,\r\nthey were laid down on the shores and beds of pre-existing seas and\r\ninland lakes. The sand-dunes are, of course, an exception, having\r\nbeen deposited by the wind on the surface of the land. Although,\r\ngeologically speaking, the oldest group of sediments with which we\r\nhave to deal belongs to the later chapters of the earth’s history,\r\nmany hundreds of thousands of years have elapsed since the sandstones\r\nand shales, now forming and underlying the floor of the oasis,\r\nwere accumulated on the bed of a vast inland lake. This sheet of\r\ncomparatively fresh water was then invaded by the sea, which held\r\nsway in the region while the whole of the series of sediments,\r\nnow exposed in the cliffs of the oasis and some 350 metres in\r\nthickness, were being laid down. In Middle Eocene times the sea\r\ncommenced to retreat to the north, and the area under description\r\nbecame dry land with a continually receding shore-line. Since that\r\ntime the forces of denudation have constantly been at work lowering\r\nthe general surface of the plateau and excavating those depressions\r\nin which alone at the present day man is able to exist.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian oases are deep and extensive depressions or hollows\r\ncut down nearly to sea-level through the generally horizontal rocks\r\nforming the Libyan Desert plateaux, and appear to owe their origin in\r\ngreat measure to the differential effects of subaërial denudation\r\nacting on rock-masses of varying hardness and composition. The\r\nsurface-features or configuration of almost any land which has long\r\nbeen exposed to the powerful forces of erosion are more or less\r\nintimately dependent on the structure and lithological characters of\r\nthe underlying rocks. On relative hardness, more than on anything\r\nelse perhaps, depend the ultimate positions of mountains, hills,\r\nand plateaux on the one hand, of valleys, plains, and depressions\r\non the other. Variation in the original conditions of deposition, at\r\nthe time when the rocks now forming the Libyan Desert were laid down\r\non the floor of the sea, has resulted in a preponderant development\r\nin some areas of soft clayey or sandy rocks (as compared with the\r\nhard limestones), and subsequent earth-movements have raised these\r\nbeds more in some districts than in others. The result has been\r\nthat wherever, during the gradual denudation to which the country\r\nsince its elevation has been subjected, these soft deposits have\r\nbecome exposed on the surface, weathering has proceeded at a greatly\r\nincreased rate, and eventually produced deep and broad depressions\r\nseparated by high limestone tablelands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH MAP\r\nSHOWING THE GEOLOGY\r\nAND THE ANCIENT LAKES OF THE\r\nOASIS OF KHARGA]\r\n\r\nBut for the presence of comparatively soft formations such as the\r\nEsna Shales, the Exogyra Beds, and the Nubian Sandstone, coupled with\r\nthe facts that they have an unequal development in different areas,\r\nand occur at a greater elevation in some localities than in others,\r\nthe great depressions of the Libyan Desert would not have come into\r\nexistence, or at any rate would have been of comparatively little\r\nimportance in the configuration of the country.\r\n\r\nThe oases are true depressions, completely or partially surrounded by\r\nhigh escarpments. The oasis of Baharia, for instance, is on all sides\r\nhemmed in by cliffs; on the other hand, Dakhla and Kharga are open to\r\nthe south, but as the ground in that direction rises considerably,\r\nthey, too, cannot be regarded as other than true depressions. We\r\nhave no definite grounds for considering that the erosion of these\r\ndepressions can have been the work of previously existing rivers,\r\nand there is no evidence to warrant us in assuming them to have\r\nbeen formed by local subsidence of portions of the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, were the agents of denudation and transportation\r\nwhich operated in the formation of these great depressions? Under\r\nthe existing arid conditions the surface rocks, unprotected by\r\nvegetation, are rapidly disintegrated or weathered as the result\r\nof the great diurnal variations of temperature to which they are\r\nsubjected (insolation). The weathered material, however, does not\r\naccumulate and form a protective soil-cap, but is carried away by\r\nthe wind (deflation), the heavier siliceous grains effecting an\r\nimmense amount of abrasion of the exposed rock-surfaces over which\r\nthey are swept. Changes of temperature, sand, and wind are, indeed,\r\nthe chief agents of erosion and transportation at the present day,\r\nand, given a sufficiency of time and a continuance of favourable\r\nconditions, we can confidently admit the combination to be capable\r\nof effecting a vast amount of earth-sculpture. But the formation,\r\nin this way, of huge hollows 300 to 400 metres deep, and the\r\nremoval of material amounting to hundreds of cubic kilometres,\r\nwould necessitate the assumption that the present rigorous desert\r\nconditions have obtained for a very considerable period.\r\n\r\nTaking all the available evidence of which we are cognizant into\r\nconsideration, we do not feel justified in assuming this to have\r\nbeen the case, especially when we recollect the frequent presence\r\non the escarpments of thick deposits of calcareous tufa, which\r\nit is evident must have been laid down after the depression had\r\nbeen carved out to a considerable depth. These tufas are almost\r\ncertainly of Pleistocene age, though whether they date from the\r\nearly or late part of that period has not been determined. In some\r\nlocalities they occur as thick, horizontally-stratified beds, and\r\nwere evidently deposited on the bottoms of lakes; in other places\r\nthey appear as fan-like cakes spread over the face of the cliff,\r\nand may have been formed by springs situated near the summits of\r\nthe escarpments. The tufas frequently contain large numbers of\r\nfresh-water shells and an abundance of fossil vegetation, and,\r\nfrom the presence of casts of the leaves of such trees as the oak,\r\none is led to refer the deposit to the more humid period which\r\npreceded the incoming of the modern desert conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the evidence met with in the field is altogether against\r\nthe idea that portions of the plateau have been bodily let down\r\nby subsidence, there are good reasons for believing that tectonic\r\nmovements have played an important part in deciding the general\r\nshape of the oases-depressions. For instance, there is considerable\r\nparallelism between the general trend of the Baharia depression\r\nand the folds which pass through that region. As a result of those\r\nfolds, it is not improbable that the hard limestone beds were to\r\nsome extent broken up, and the soft underlying clays and sandstones\r\nraised as compared with their position on either side of the folded\r\nbelt. In Kharga, similarly, the main axis of the depression is, as\r\nwe shall show, distinctly parallel to the great north and south line\r\nof flexure, and there is little doubt that a close connection exists\r\nbetween the two. On the other hand, I know of no folding in the case\r\nof Farafra, which appears to owe its existence solely to the fact\r\nthat there was in that region an unusual development of shales at\r\nthe base of the Eocene nummulitic limestones. Of the four Egyptian\r\noases, perhaps Dakhla is the one most easily accounted for, as this\r\ndepression may be regarded as simply due to the general northerly\r\ndip of the sedimentary formations, and the gradual weathering back\r\n(northwards) of the great argillaceous series (Exogyra Beds) capped\r\nby the White Chalk. The original limits of the latter may, indeed,\r\nnever have been very far to the south.[3]\r\n\r\nWhile all sedimentary strata—such as the limestones, sandstones,\r\nclays, and shales with which we are now dealing—were originally\r\ndeposited either quite horizontally or inclined at only a very low\r\nangle, it by no means follows that this horizontality is maintained\r\nwhen the strata are elevated into dry land. Over the Libyan Desert\r\nas a whole the successive sedimentary formations dip steadily\r\nnorthwards, but at a very small inclination. This results in every\r\nstage having a wide outcrop, so much so that, if it were not for\r\nthe cliff-sections of the Nile Valley and the oases-depressions,\r\nwe should have to travel immense distances to obtain any idea of\r\nthe true succession of rocks. This general horizontality of strata\r\nappears at first sight to be well maintained in the oasis of Kharga,\r\nas whether we stand on the summit of the eastern escarpment, on top\r\nof the great central hill-massif of Jebel Tarif, or on the plateau\r\nabove Ain Amûr, we see everywhere horizontally-disposed beds of\r\nlimestone forming the plateaux and upper portions of the cliffs,\r\nwith parallel bands of sandstone, shale, and chalk outcropping on\r\nthe slopes below.\r\n\r\nA closer examination, however, will show that there is in reality\r\na difference in level of more than 200 metres between the same beds\r\non either side of the oasis; for the beds capping Jebel Tarif belong\r\nto the White Chalk of the Cretaceous system, and are therefore very\r\nmuch older than those of Eocene age forming the eastern plateau\r\n(see map and section). This great difference in vertical position\r\nis due partly to a steady dip from west to east, partly to a\r\nremarkable longitudinal flexure running north and south through\r\nthe centre of the depression, and partly to a gentle fold near the\r\nbase of the eastern escarpment. Along the actual line of flexure,\r\nwhich passes through Jebel Têr, Jebel Tarwan, Nadûra, Gorn el\r\nGennâh, and Gertuma (S.S.E. of Bulaq), the different rock-stages\r\nare folded and fractured to a remarkable degree. Throughout the\r\ngreater part of its course the flexure approximates to the type of\r\ndisturbance known as a simple monocline, but in places, as in Jebel\r\nTêr, it passes into a syncline bounded by nearly vertical faults;\r\nwhile in others the beds are bent into almost symmetrical basins or\r\ncentroclinal folds, typical examples of these structures being met\r\nwith at points 6 kilometres south of Kharga village and 2 kilometres\r\nsouth-west of Qasr Zaiyan.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this line of folding and faulting must not be lost\r\nsight of, as although the dislocations produced are only actually\r\nvisible in the case of the exposed upper beds of the oasis sequence,\r\nthe earth-movements to which it owes its origin have had similar\r\ndisturbing effects on the underlying and hidden water-bearing\r\nstrata. Ball reported that the most striking evidence of faulting\r\nwas between Jebel Têr and Jebel Tarif, and showed the fault as\r\nrunning for a short distance in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction, but,\r\nas already mentioned, the line of disturbance is coincident with\r\nthe longer axis of the former range, so that the majority of the\r\nwells are on the west or upthrow side of the fault. The effects of\r\nthis faulting and folding on the underground water-supply will be\r\nfurther alluded to in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of this year (1908) I followed the line of\r\nflexure southwards in order to determine whether it continued\r\nthroughout the oasis. As far as the small eminence of Gala, about\r\n10 kilometres south of Bulaq, it ran in an almost straight line,\r\nbut south of that point its course took a distinct bend to the\r\nwest, so that the fold was very soon lost in the great belt of\r\nsand-dunes. Beyond this point its continuation could, however, be\r\ninferred by occasional exposures of steeply inclined sandstones,\r\nthe most southerly point to which it was actually traced being\r\nin latitude 24° 55′ N., about 15 kilometres S.S.W. of Ain Girm\r\nMeshîm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOLOGICAL SECTION ACROSS THE OASIS FROM JEBEL TARIF\r\nTO THE EASTERN ESCARPMENT.]\r\n\r\nBefore concluding our remarks on the geology of the oasis we must not\r\nomit to call attention to the beautiful and varied fossil remains\r\nwhich are almost everywhere to be met with in the calcareous beds\r\nof the hills and escarpments. It is, of course, by the study and\r\ncomparison of these organic remains that geologists are enabled to\r\ndetermine the relative ages of the beds in which they occur, and\r\nthus to correlate them with the rocks of other countries. The lower\r\nargillaceous and arenaceous deposits of the oasis are comparatively\r\nunfossiliferous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom any of the points of vantage, such as are afforded by the\r\nhigher hills within the depression, the general level of the\r\nfloor of the oasis does not appear to vary to any great extent,\r\nbut actual levelling shows that this is not in reality the case;\r\nand it is this variation of absolute level which is the primary\r\ncause of the very varying volumes of water yielded by the artesian\r\nwells in the different districts.\r\n\r\nThe average height of the centre of the depression in the\r\nneighbourhood of the village of Kharga is approximately the same\r\nas that of the Nile Valley plain in the latitude of Farshut.\r\n\r\nBall, by comparison of a series of aneroid barometer readings with\r\nthe barometric records for the same period at the Cairo observatory,\r\ndeduced the value of a point near Kharga village as 86 metres above\r\nsea-level, and used this as his datum in calculating the levels of\r\nother parts of the oasis. Previous aneroid determinations of the\r\nsame point had been made by Cailliaud (104 and 118 metres) and by\r\nJordan (68 metres). But even when the greatest possible precautions\r\nare exercised, aneroid determinations, especially when made with\r\na single instrument, are necessarily unreliable, and still more\r\nso when used for calculating the levels of different points on a\r\nplain having only comparatively slight irregularities of surface.\r\n\r\nUtilizing the figure obtained by the railway surveyors for a point\r\nnear the termination of the line, we get values of 58 and 60 metres\r\nabove sea-level for Kharga village and Bore No. 1 at headquarters\r\nrespectively, and a bench-mark at the latter place, having a value\r\nof 60·1, is used as the datum from which all the heights given\r\nin this book are calculated. Unfortunately it is not possible,\r\nowing to the lack of sufficient check-levels, to state the limit\r\nof probable error, and it must therefore be understood that the\r\nvalue of our datum, which in the meantime may be accepted as the\r\nbest obtainable, is subject to future revision.\r\n\r\nFrom this central point (Bore No. 1) lines of levels have recently\r\nbeen carried in every direction by Mr. F. E. Apted and myself,\r\nwith the result that it has been shown that the general level of\r\nthe floor of the oasis rises steadily to the north and falls to\r\nthe south. These levels have in all cases been checked, and may,\r\nusing the datum mentioned, be accepted as fairly reliable, the\r\nclosing errors on the different loops being generally within a very\r\nfew centimetres. The altitudes of a few reference points in each\r\ndistrict are given here.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+-------------------------+-----------+\r\n  |       District.       |          Point.         | Altitude. |\r\n  +-----------------------+-------------------------+-----------+\r\n  | Headquarters          | Bore No. 1              |   60·1    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Bore No. 44             |   53·1    |\r\n  | Kharga                | Bir Ain el Gôs          |   70·2    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain el Sabbagh          |   56·9    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain Zaaf                |   87·7    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Temple of Hibis (floor) |   75·0    |\r\n  | Meheriq               | Bir Qattara             |   56·6    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain Mahmud              |   64·8    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain el Burg             |   69·6    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain el Qasr             |   76·0    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain el Ghazâl           |   84·6    |\r\n  | South of headquarters | Ain Harrân              |   43·5    |\r\n  |  ”  ”  ”              | Ain Ali Morad           |   33·0    |\r\n  |  ”  ”  ”              | Ain Bellal              |   28·4    |\r\n  |  ”  ”  ”              | Ain el Tawîl            |   19·7    |\r\n  | Gennâh                | Ain Estakherab          |   71·3    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain Magarin             |   74·6    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain el Ghuâta (north)   |   48·2    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Ain Zaiyan              |   41·6    |\r\n  |  ”                    | Qasr Zaiyan             |   20·7    |\r\n  | El Dêr                | Bore No. 22             |   92·3    |\r\n  +-----------------------+-------------------------+-----------+\r\n\r\nThe Government Survey maps show a portion of the oasis floor as\r\nlying below sea-level, the difference of height between the Kharga\r\nvillage datum and a point just south of Qasr Zaiyan being given as\r\n104 metres. Detailed surveying shows that this estimate is excessive,\r\nthe true difference being about 37 metres only. Although no actual\r\nreading has yet been obtained below sea-level—the lowest being\r\n+2·6 metres at a point 3½ kilometres north-east of the northern\r\nend of the Gorn el Gennâh, or nearly midway between that hill and\r\nAin el Tawîl—it is evident that in this district the floor is\r\nonly very slightly higher than the sea, and it may be that at one\r\nor two points its level is actually lower.\r\n\r\nSouth of Qasr Zaiyan no revision of previous levels has as yet\r\nbeen made. According to Ball’s figures, the village of Beris is\r\napproximately 10 metres lower than Kharga.\r\n\r\nWhile discussing the subject of levels it may be useful to note the\r\nrelative heights of the escarpments and hills within the oasis. The\r\nedge of the eastern plateau varies from 350 to 400 metres above\r\nsea-level, while the plateau to the north of Um el Dabâdib has a\r\ngeneral level of about 400 metres. Jebel Tarif appears to be very\r\nslightly higher, while the highest peak on Jebel Têr is not much\r\nmore than 300 metres. The altitudes of these points with reference\r\nto the village were mostly determined by Ball by trigonometric\r\nobservations with an eight-inch theodolite, and can therefore be\r\nrelied on as being accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                         THE NORTHERN VILLAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation — Relation of Population to Water-Supply — Trade\r\nin Dates — Imports — Taxation on Date-Palms and Wells —\r\nMeasurement of Wells — Revenue derived from the Oasis — Origin of\r\nInhabitants — Kharga Village — Industries — Ancient and Modern\r\nWells — Meheriq Village — Troubles with Sand — Migration of\r\nVillagers — Ain el Tawîl and other Hamlets — Gennâh Village\r\n— Famous Wells — Ain Estakherab — Ochreous Waters of certain\r\nWells — Ain el Ghuâta — Bulaq Village — Doum-Palms — Tomb\r\nof Sheikh Khalid Ibn el Walîd.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn point of population Kharga ranks second of the four great oases\r\nof the Libyan Desert. In 1897 the inhabitants numbered 7,856, and\r\nten years later had increased to 8,348. The 1907 census showed the\r\nmale to be slightly in excess of the female population, a result\r\nentirely owing to the preponderance of men in the northern part of\r\nthe oasis. The present distribution of the inhabitants, according\r\nto the last census, is shown in the table on the following page.\r\n\r\nIn the oases of the Libyan Desert there is a very close connection\r\nbetween population and water-supply. No water is intentionally\r\nallowed to run to waste, every drop being utilized to raise\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+-------+---------+--------+\r\n  |                 | Male. | Female. | Total. |\r\n  +-----------------+-------+---------+--------+\r\n  | Kharga District | 2,819 |  2,503  | 5,322  |\r\n  | Gennâh District |   207 |    237  |   444  |\r\n  | Bulaq District  |   487 |    529  | 1,016  |\r\n  | Beris District  |   767 |    799  | 1,566  |\r\n  |                 +-------+---------+--------+\r\n  |          Total  | 4,280 |  4,068  | 8,348  |\r\n  +-----------------+-------+---------+--------+\r\n\r\nthe crops of rice, dates, barley, and wheat, which form the staple\r\nfood-supplies of the inhabitants. Cut off by a waterless desert,\r\nthese people have little intercourse with the outside world, except\r\nfor a few weeks in the early winter months, when they dispose of\r\ntheir surplus date-crop to the Bedawin traders who cross the desert\r\nwith droves of camels from the Nile Valley. The dates are usually\r\npaid for in cash, ready-money being required in order to meet the\r\nannual taxes levied by the Egyptian Government. Practically the only\r\nfood-stuffs imported consist of such commodities as tea, coffee,\r\nand sugar, which are used sparingly, and regarded as luxuries even\r\nby the better classes.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the inhabitants rely almost entirely\r\nfor subsistence on the products they are able to raise by their own\r\ntoil and industry. Owing to there being no rainfall, the acreage\r\nof land which can be put under crops depends absolutely on the\r\namount of water available for irrigation by wells. The total yield\r\nof the latter has, we know, fluctuated to a considerable extent\r\nat different times, and one may surmise that, could figures be\r\nobtained giving the number of inhabitants and the volume of the\r\nwater-supply for different periods during the last 5,000 years,\r\na remarkably constant ratio would be observable between the two.\r\n\r\nTaxes are levied by the Egyptian Government on both date-trees\r\nand wells. Over 60,000 adult palms exist in the oasis, each one\r\nbeing subject to a yearly tax of 1½ piastres (about 3½d.). The\r\noutput or yield of a well is, for purposes of taxation, determined\r\nin a somewhat rough-and-ready manner by a method which appears to\r\nhave been in use for a number of generations. Whenever a new bore\r\nis completed, or an old well requires remeasurement, all the most\r\ninfluential personages in the oasis, headed by the Omda or chief\r\nof Kharga village, armed with a number of primitive appliances,\r\nsolemnly proceed to the spot.\r\n\r\nAfter first ascertaining that the well has not been temporarily\r\nblocked by interested persons—even here in the remote interior\r\nof the desert there is an inherent objection to the paying of\r\ntaxes—the bed and sides of the water-channel are made as smooth\r\nas possible for a distance of five or ten paces below the mouth\r\nof the well, so that the water flows away with an even ripple. A\r\nsmall pointed stick is now inserted in the centre of the bed of the\r\nstream, in such a way that the top of the peg is exactly flush with\r\nthe surface of the water. Then the Omda, hitching up his flowing\r\nrobes, steps into the stream, and, selecting a gauge of suitable\r\ndimensions, fixes it firmly in the bed of the channel, in such a\r\nposition that the whole of the flow passes freely through, without\r\nraising or lowering the surface of the stream above, as indicated\r\nby the peg. The interior of the gauge, a roughly-made wooden frame,\r\nis intended to be a definite number of centimetres in length, but\r\nin many of those used there is a small error. As soon as the stream\r\nflows evenly over the gauge or weir, without its surface-level being\r\naltered, the depth of water is measured on a scale. The latter is\r\nwetted and plunged into a heap of dry sand before being used, the\r\ndepth of water being indicated by that portion of the scale from\r\nwhich the sand has been removed by the immersion. Observations are\r\nmade at both ends of the weir to insure any error due to want of\r\nhorizontality of the frame being detected.\r\n\r\nThe actual discharge is reckoned in ‘qirats’ and eighths\r\nof a qirat (tumns), a qirat being a water-section of 64 square\r\ncentimetres. For example, if the depth of water passing over a\r\ngauge having an internal length of 40 centimetres was found to be 8\r\ncentimetres, the water-section would amount to 40 × 8 = 320 square\r\ncentimetres, which would be reckoned as a discharge of 5 qirats.\r\n\r\nThe Omda and his attendants carry out the operations with the\r\nutmost care and solemnity, and have the most touching faith in\r\nthe accuracy of their results. Apart, however, from errors in the\r\ngauges and scales used, and from the want of provision of a free\r\nfall on the downstream side of the weir, the fact that the velocity\r\nof the stream is entirely left out of account is sufficient to\r\ngive the qirat a very variable value, low for small and high for\r\nlarge streams, the result being that the small wells are being\r\ntaxed at about 50 per cent. higher rates than the large ones. In\r\norder to ascertain the average value of the qirat for streams of\r\ndifferent size, I arranged with Mr. Patterson, who at the time\r\nwas the Government Representative in Kharga, to send the Omda to\r\nheadquarters and instruct him to measure a number of new bores\r\nbelonging to the Corporation of Western Egypt, as these bores,\r\nbeing cased and provided with proper outlet valves, lend themselves\r\nto exact measurement better than the majority of the native-owned\r\nwells. The Omda employed the ordinary local native method just\r\ndescribed, while I, using a tank of known capacity and a reliable\r\nstop-watch, made direct measurements immediately afterwards. The\r\nresults obtained show that below 2 the qirat has a value of 22\r\ngallons a minute; from 2 to 4 of 26 gallons a minute; and from 5\r\nto 6 of 38 gallons a minute.\r\n\r\nThe annual tax levied on the water amounts to 50 piastres (about\r\n10s. 3d.) per qirat. If the average value of the qirat be taken at 25\r\ngallons per minute, the tax works out at approximately 1s. for every\r\n6,000 cubic metres of water. Looked at from another point of view,\r\nit may be considered that the tax amounts to about 1s. 6d. an acre,\r\nas with every qirat of water the native cultivator in the oasis will\r\nannually raise about two acres of rice and five of wheat or barley.\r\n\r\nThe total revenue derived by the Government from the oasis, by taxes\r\non date-palms and water, amounts to a little over £1,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nMy old friend Sheikh Mustapha, who for more than twelve years has\r\nbeen Omda of Kharga village, was very anxious to know the results of\r\nthe comparative measurements made on the bores. He professed himself\r\nas surprised at the difference in the results, but emphatically\r\nrefused to entertain the possibility of there being any error in his\r\nmeasurements, made by so old-established a method. Although he was\r\nfar too polite to so express himself in words, I felt that the old\r\ngentleman had the utmost contempt for my method of well measurement.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Dakhla peasants, the inhabitants of the\r\noases differ entirely from the fellahin of the Nile Valley. According\r\nto Brugsch, the original inhabitants were Libyan (Berber) tribes,\r\nbut after annexation to Egypt, there was considerable immigration\r\nfrom Nubia and other parts of the Nile Valley. Nevertheless, in\r\nthe oasis of Kharga the physiognomic type of the Berber race is\r\nstill predominant.\r\n\r\nEl Kharga, the chief village of the oasis, containing about 4,500\r\ninhabitants, is situated in a broad belt of cultivated lands and\r\npalm-groves running centrally down the depression from the southern\r\nextremity of Jebel Têr. The village consists of a picturesque\r\ncompact conglomeration of houses, built of sun-dried bricks, and\r\nof every shape and size. The streets meander in a very remarkable\r\nmanner, and are to a large extent in partial or total darkness,\r\nowing to their being for the most part roofed over and covered by\r\nupper storeys. Without the aid of a guide it is almost impossible\r\nto find one’s way through the intricacies of the underground\r\npassages, though no fears need be entertained on the score of\r\nbeing in any way molested, the inhabitants being most peaceably\r\ninclined. In some parts of the village the streets are actually cut\r\nthrough the solid rock. They are generally clean and cool even on\r\nthe hottest and dustiest of days, and as a rule the few wayfarers\r\none meets scuttle like startled rabbits into the dark recesses on\r\neither side, from the depths of which, and through chinks in the\r\nwooden doors and windows, they can gape in safety at the unwonted\r\nspectacle of European visitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN KHARGA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KHARGA VILLAGE.]\r\n\r\nViewed from the outside, say from the ridge of sand which hems\r\nin the village on the east side, one sees a vast array of walls,\r\nsurmounted by screens of dried palm-branches, bound together to\r\nform compact hedges affording protection and privacy to those\r\nportions of the houses open to the sky. Two minarets rise above\r\nthe general level, while all around are palm-groves and gardens,\r\nwith the open desert rising to the western horizon.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of the population is engaged in agriculture, and as\r\nin some cases the wells are situated far from the village, many of\r\nthe peasants daily ride considerable distances to and fro on their\r\nsturdy but diminutive donkeys. There are two or three small shops\r\nin the village, but nothing in the nature of bazaars, the chief\r\nbusiness transacted being the retailing of Nile Valley goods, such\r\nas drapery and groceries. The native women are adepts at basket- and\r\nmat-making, and mention must not be omitted of the very attractive\r\nspherical baskets made of palm-leaves and fibre, ornamented with\r\ncoloured wools, and manufactured in every conceivable size and\r\ndesign. Pretty circular trays are made from the same substances;\r\nin fact, the number of uses to which the waste materials from the\r\ndate- and doum-palms can be put is little short of marvellous.\r\n\r\nEverything connected with the village is of the most primitive\r\ndescription, and until a very short time ago few of the inhabitants\r\nhad been beyond the limits of their own fields. The advent of\r\nthe railway caused no little commotion and stir in the oasis,\r\nand awakened trading instincts which had lain dormant since Roman\r\ntimes. Many of the villagers now travel to and fro between Kharga\r\nand the Nile Valley, and the Omda took an early opportunity of\r\nobtaining leave of absence from his onerous duties, and proceeded\r\nto Alexandria for a course of sea-baths!\r\n\r\nOutside the village, with the exception of the antiquities, to which\r\nwe shall call attention in a separate chapter, there is little of\r\ngeneral interest beyond the wells and gardens, among which there\r\nare many picturesque spots. At Bir Ain el Gôs, a few kilometres\r\nto the north, a primitive form of corn-mill may be seen working,\r\nthe grinding-stones being driven by the water of the well by means\r\nof an undershot wheel.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here that with very few, if any, exceptions\r\nthe different streams which collectively make up the water-supply\r\nof the oasis find their way to the surface through artificially\r\nconstructed passages. The great majority of these are bores of\r\nancient construction, though a few have been sunk with modern plant\r\nduring the last fifty years. The ancient wells are known as Aiyûn\r\n(sing. Ain), the modern as Abiyâr (sing. Bir); for example,\r\nAin el Ghazâl, Bir Mansûra. In cases where a modern bore has\r\nbeen specially sunk to replace an ancient well, the two words are\r\nused in conjunction; for instance, Bir Ain el Gôs. The position of\r\neach well is nearly always conspicuously marked by a thick clump of\r\nacacias, from which (more especially in the isolated settlements in\r\nthe northern part of the depression) the main irrigating channel\r\ngenerally runs in a southerly direction, the cultivated lands\r\nbeing of triangular form, with the apex at or near the source of\r\nthe water, and raised little, if at all, above the general level\r\nof the surrounding plain. By this disposition the fields present\r\nthe least possible front to the north, from which side comes the\r\nbulk of the sand which is such a curse to these outlying settlements.\r\n\r\nKharga village, being snugly situated among palm-groves, and\r\ndirectly to the south of Jebel Têr, is well protected from the\r\nfierce, sand-laden winds which so frequently scour the depression\r\nfrom north to south. The poor little hamlet of Meheriq, on the\r\nother hand, set on the open plain some 20 kilometres to the north,\r\nis exposed to every wind that blows, with the result that the sand\r\nhas accumulated to such an extent that most of the palms have been\r\nburied, and many of the houses have been overwhelmed. The advancing\r\ndunes are, in fact, steadily pushing the hamlet southwards. At\r\nfrequent intervals the occupants of the most northerly houses move\r\ntheir goods and chattels, and betake themselves to new quarters\r\nerected at the southern extremity. This periodical migration has,\r\nindeed, become so ingrained a habit that it is now regarded as of\r\nlittle moment; it is only when their wells and trees are threatened\r\nand destroyed that the wretched people call on Allah to stay His\r\nhand, and protect them from destruction.\r\n\r\nStill farther to the north lie a number of isolated wells with small\r\nareas of cultivation, and at some of these there are settlements\r\nconsisting of one or two families. Ain el Tawîl, 8 kilometres\r\nsouth-east of Kharga, is another little hamlet, rendered more\r\nconspicuous than most of these outlying settlements by the presence\r\nof a Sheikh’s tomb surmounted by a rather pointed dome. A third\r\nimportant dependency of Kharga is known as Um el Dabâdib, and is\r\nsituated a day’s journey to the north. This place is of exceptional\r\ninterest, in that its water-supply is not derived from wells, but\r\nfrom extensive tunnels driven into the hills. Some most interesting\r\nruins exist in the neighbourhood, but a description of these and\r\nof the subterranean aqueducts must be postponed to a later chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: ENCROACHMENT OF SAND-DUNES AT MEHERIQ.]\r\n\r\nTwelve kilometres to the south of Kharga lies the village of\r\nGennâh. The intermediate country is largely covered by sand, which\r\nin the neighbourhood of the village has accumulated into large dunes,\r\nthreatening it and its magnificent wells, Ain Estakherab and Ain\r\nMagarin, with ultimate destruction. Ain Estakherab is undoubtedly the\r\nfinest well in the Libyan Desert, and has been running for hundreds,\r\nif not for thousands, of years; but unless special measures are taken\r\nto cope with the advance of the dunes immediately to the north and\r\nnorth-west, this splendid flow of water is doomed to destruction\r\nwithin the next ten or twenty years. Owing to the encroachment\r\nof the sand there is very little land available for cultivation\r\nnear the village, the bulk of the water from the two wells being\r\nconducted in an open channel to the low-lying plain south-east of\r\nthe hill-range known as the Gorn el Gennâh. This channel traverses 7\r\nor 8 kilometres of porous desert before it reaches the first of the\r\ncultivated fields in the neighbourhood of the Gorn, and there is in\r\nconsequence very great loss of water through seepage and evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe famous wells of Gennâh differ from most of those in the\r\nnorthern part of the oasis in that their mouths are large and deep\r\npools of limpid water, from the depths of which great bubbles of\r\ngas constantly ascend to the surface. Little or nothing is known as\r\nto the age and depth of either of these wells; they have never been\r\ncleaned out in modern times, and are closed in at a depth of a few\r\nmetres from the surface in such a way as to prevent soundings being\r\nmade. With the object of determining if the large discharges are due\r\nto the wells being situated on exceptionally low ground, I recently\r\nhad a line of levels run from headquarters to Gennâh. Contrary\r\nto expectation, it was found that Ain Estakherab and Ain Magarin\r\ndischarged at levels considerably above the average elevation of the\r\nwells of the Kharga district; possibly, therefore, the exceptional\r\nflows in this district are due to its comparative isolation, and\r\nto the immunity thus obtained from the interference of other wells.\r\n\r\nBetween the villages of Kharga and Gennâh, along a north and south\r\nbelt lying somewhat to the east and on the downthrow side of the\r\nfault, are a number of wells whose waters are almost invariably\r\nmore or less charged with ochre and alkaline salts. In some cases\r\nthe proportion of dissolved salts is sufficiently great to render\r\nthe water unfit for either drinking or irrigation, and even where\r\nit can be used for the latter purpose, ochre is deposited to such an\r\nextent as to bind the soil into a hard cake. The occurrence appears\r\nto be due to the geological position of the wells in this tract,\r\nwhere, owing to the beds being let down by the fault, the purple\r\nshales form the floor of the depression; it is perhaps from these\r\nbeds that the waters derive their abnormally high contents of ferric\r\noxide and other salts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PTOLEMAIC TEMPLE, QASR EL GHUATA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUM-PALMS NEAR QASR EL GHUATA.]\r\n\r\nThe wells near Qasr el Ghuâta are of similar nature, and thick banks\r\nof ochre have been deposited along their channels. I recollect on\r\none occasion using the water of Ain el Ghuâta for making tea, and\r\nbeing considerably surprised at the inky blackness of the resulting\r\nliquid, although, in spite of the colour and a markedly ferruginous\r\ntaste, the brew was not undrinkable.\r\n\r\nNear the ruins of Qasr Zaiyan, and southward as far as the village\r\nof Bulaq, the country takes on quite a different aspect, owing to\r\nthe numerous scrub-covered areas, dotted everywhere with semi-wild\r\ndoum-palms. Doums thrive in very poor soil, and appear to be\r\nself-sown; they are to my mind far more graceful and picturesque than\r\nthe ordinary date-palms, from which they differ in many important\r\nrespects. The trunk of a well-grown doum-palm is forked, not once,\r\nbut many times, the different stems preserving a considerable amount\r\nof symmetry; the branches, which are covered with the most atrocious\r\nhooks, terminate in sharp-pointed, serrated fan-shaped leaves. The\r\nfruit consists of bunches of hard nuts, and can be eaten either in\r\nits raw condition or after being ground into meal and cooked; most\r\npersons, however, except perhaps confirmed nut-eating vegetarians,\r\nwould decline it in either state. Although the country throughout\r\nwhich the doum-palms abound appears to be more or less deserted,\r\nevery tree has its owner among the inhabitants of the nearest\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nBulaq, distant 25 kilometres from Kharga, has a population of 1,016,\r\nand is the centre of the mat and ‘zambile’ trade. The zambile\r\nis an open wide-mouthed basket which is used in every part of Egypt,\r\nand practically replaces the wheelbarrow of western lands. Formerly\r\nonly small quantities were made for export, but the natives have not\r\nbeen slow to take advantage of the railway, and truck-loads of these\r\nbaskets may now be frequently seen on the trains. The Bulaq varieties\r\nof mats and baskets are mostly made from the leaf of the doum-palm.\r\n\r\nThe village, bounded on three sides by sand and open desert, with\r\nthe palm-groves and cultivated lands to the east, cannot be said to\r\nbe particularly attractive. A few kilometres to the south is the\r\ntomb of Sheikh Khalid Ibn el Walîd, a large, square, whitewashed\r\nbuilding surmounted by a dome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                         THE SOUTHERN VILLAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nAin Girm Meshîm — Agûl el Douma — The Southern Villages —\r\nJaja and Dakhakhin — Intermittent Flow and Geyser-like Action of\r\nWells — Ain Dakhakhin — Fruit Gardens — Raised Cultivated\r\nTerraces formed of Wind-blown Materials — Gradual Elevation of\r\nWells — Ancient Village of Dakhakhin — Ain Bergis — Beris\r\nVillage — Ain el Hushi — Block-Houses and Dervishes — Maks\r\nBahari — Method Employed in Cleaning out Wells — Ain Bella —\r\nEncroachment of Dunes — Dush — The most Southern Wells of the\r\nOasis — Nakhail.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the wells belonging to Bulaq the traveller has\r\nto cross a stretch of desert about 40 kilometres in width before\r\nreaching the first well and cultivated land of the southern group of\r\nvillages. On this expanse water is only found in one locality—at\r\nAin Girm Meshîm, a pool with a very small flow. There is little\r\ndoubt that this was at one time a very good well, as traces of\r\nirrigating channels extend outwards to a considerable distance;\r\nmoreover, a large salt-pan is still visible to the west, and this\r\ncould only have been formed at a time when there was far more water\r\nrunning to waste than at present. The immediate neighbourhood is\r\npicturesquely dotted with doum-palms, some of those near the well\r\nbeing magnificent trees.\r\n\r\nAgûl el Douma, lying 17 kilometres south-west of Ain Girm Meshîm,\r\non the opposite (west) side of the belt of dunes, is a place which,\r\nprevious to my inspection, had probably never been visited by\r\nEuropeans, although known to a few of the Bedawin. Surface-water\r\ncan be obtained by digging to a depth of a few feet near one of the\r\ndoums. The place, marked by a small area of scrub and a doum-palm or\r\ntwo, was formerly used to some extent by Arabs carrying contraband\r\nfrom the south, as by watering here they were able to pass through\r\nthe oasis unobserved.\r\n\r\nThe most northerly of the southern villages are Jaja and Dakhakhin,\r\nbut 6 kilometres to the north lies an isolated group of doum-palms,\r\nknown as Ain el Douma. At the present time the place is uninhabited,\r\nthe old well being completely sanded-up, though water may be\r\nobtained by digging out the centre. Both north and south of Ain el\r\nDouma occur smooth plains of alluvial clay, in the latter direction\r\nextending to the villages of Dakhakhin and Jaja.\r\n\r\nJaja is visible from a distance of many kilometres on account\r\nof a thick clump of dark green acacias, growing on the summit of\r\nan eminence. Dakhakhin, on the other hand, is hidden, being on the\r\nsouth side of a sandy hill covered with short scrub only. A low-lying\r\nportion of the alluvial-covered plain separates the two villages,\r\nwhich are situated close together on an east and west line.\r\n\r\nAt Jaja there are scattered doums and a number of acacias, as well\r\nas a small dense grove of date-palms, altogether a goodly number\r\nof trees. The well is a broad and deep pool surrounded by vertical\r\nwalls of brown clay, representing the material from time to time\r\nthrown out during the process of cleaning. Large bubbles of gas are\r\ngenerally to be seen rising intermittently to the surface, while at\r\ntimes the pool becomes perfectly still, except for the occasional\r\nsmall bubbles which continue to rise at different points. Then\r\nfollows a strong flow from the actual bore (situated near the south\r\nside of the pool), the water boiling up and breaking the surface\r\nwith considerable force and noise, which may continue for several\r\nminutes before everything becomes quiet again. In all probability\r\nthe markedly intermittent flow is due to the temporary blocking\r\nof the bore-hole by the sediment forming the bottom of the pool,\r\nthe mud being from time to time forced back by the accumulating\r\npressure of the water and gas below. The temperature of the water\r\nwas found to be 86° F., and the yield was stated to amount to 1½\r\nqirats, or about 35 to 40 gallons a minute.\r\n\r\nDakhakhin is charmingly situated on the southern slope of an\r\neminence, alongside a dingle, prettily wooded with tamarisk and\r\ndoum-palms. The well is on the north side, and higher up than the\r\nvillage. One of the irrigating channels, cut out near the bottom of\r\nthe western slope, follows the winding of the dingle to a thick clump\r\nof date-palms near the mouth. Higher up, alongside the village, the\r\nwater in another channel races down the hill in a series of little\r\nruns and falls, the stream threading its way through fruit-gardens\r\ncontaining date-palms and vines, fig, mulberry, and apricot trees,\r\nas well as pomegranates and bananas.\r\n\r\nAin Dakhakhin is a huge pool when full, though at times, when the\r\nretaining bank on the south side is cut, a large part of its sandy\r\nbed is exposed. The flow, taxed, I believe, as 3½ qirats (110 to\r\n120 gallons per minute), varies at different times of the year,\r\nand depends to a considerable extent on the amount of sediment in\r\nthe pool. Cleaning is periodically undertaken, in order to remove\r\nthe sand which drifts in from the north side in large quantities.\r\n\r\nNeither in Ain Jaja nor Ain Dakhakhin is there any trace of wooden\r\ncasing similar to that with which the ancient wells of Northern\r\nKharga are so commonly lined. This bears out the conclusion to\r\nwhich I was led on other grounds—that the original outlets were\r\nmany metres lower than at present, on the level of the surrounding\r\nplain, in fact. The eminences of Jaja and Dakhakhin appear to have\r\nbeen formed almost entirely by the gradual accumulation of blown\r\nsand and clay-dust, compacted and held together by vegetation. The\r\nmaterial is swept by the prevalent winds from the clay plains and\r\nsandy deserts lying to the north, and deposited on the cultivated\r\nlands, owing to the presence thereon of water and vegetation. Its\r\ndeposition is encouraged by the peasants, as the admixture of sand\r\nand clay forms a loam of suitable texture for agricultural purposes,\r\nand is regarded as having considerable fertilizing value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AIN DAKHAKHIN.]\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that originally nearly all the wells\r\nin Southern Kharga had their outlets on the same level as the\r\nplain. Owing to the periodical deposition of wind-borne materials,\r\nthe cultivated lands have gradually risen, until at the present day\r\nthey form, in the majority of cases, terraces standing well above the\r\ngeneral level. This continual raising of the land has necessitated\r\na corresponding elevation of the wells, with the result that the\r\nwooden linings originally put into the bores have been completely\r\nlost sight of. Instead of issuing from a clean, unobstructed hole,\r\nthe water has now to force its way upwards through a great mass of\r\nsandy mud, and before it can be utilized it has to rise to a much\r\nhigher level than formerly. Little wonder, then, that the flows\r\nof the majority of these wells have very much decreased, with\r\nthe consequence that the cultivated tracts are much smaller than\r\nof old. In more than one case the outlet of a well had, in modern\r\ntimes, risen to such a height that the discharge had become reduced\r\nto a mere trickle. Twenty or twenty-five years ago, for instance,\r\nAin Dakhakhin was on the summit of an eminence which, by the slow\r\naccumulation of sand and clay, had reached a height of 30 metres\r\nabove the surrounding plain. Remedial measures were then taken by\r\nthe inhabitants, and its level reduced by between 8 and 9 metres,\r\nthe present level of the well and highest fields being 23 metres\r\nabove the plain.\r\n\r\nThe height of a cultivated terrace above the general level of the\r\nplain on which the well was originally sunk affords some measure\r\nof its antiquity. It is difficult, however, in the absence of\r\nobservations extending over a number of years, to estimate what the\r\ngeneral rate of accumulation may have been. It would, moreover,\r\nvary greatly with local conditions, but if an average rate of a\r\ncentimetre a year be assumed, the age of Ain Dakhakhin is indicated\r\nas being something over 3,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Dakhakhin lies a kilometre to the S.S.E., and,\r\nwhen inhabited, must have been as ugly as the modern village is\r\npleasing. When the diminution of the flow of Ain Dakhakhin became\r\nserious, the people migrated to their present location, so as to be\r\nnear the well and under the shelter of the hill. The ruins are only\r\nslightly above the level of the plain, but cover an area many times\r\ngreater than that occupied by the modern village. This circumstance\r\nalone shows how insignificant is the present flow compared with\r\nwhat it must once have been.\r\n\r\nThe most northerly of the group of wells in the neighbourhood of\r\nBeris is Ain Bergis, situated on the south side of a broad platform\r\nof sandy lacustrine beds. In this case there is a containing bank\r\nacross the valley below the well, but at the time of my visit it\r\nwas cut, so that the bottom of the pool was exposed. The latter\r\nconsisted of a circular basin of soft sediment, through which muddy\r\nwater was oozing and bursting in small shoots, suggesting an action\r\nin many respects analogous to that of geysers and mud-volcanoes. The\r\nnatives informed me that the basin takes two days and nights to\r\nfill after the bank has been closed.\r\n\r\nBetween Ain Bergis and Dakhakhin stretches a continuous plain of\r\nalluvial clay, amounting to several thousands of acres. In its\r\npresent state this heavy clay land is not regarded as of much value\r\nfor cultivation, but in the event of new wells being sunk it could\r\nbe lightened and improved by allowing and encouraging the deposition\r\nof blown sand and dust—by following, in fact, the practice which\r\nfrom time immemorial has been in vogue in this district.\r\n\r\nThe best wells in the neighbourhood of Beris are Johar, Foq el\r\nDoum, and El Hushi, the last named yielding 6 qirats, the others 9\r\neach. The remaining wells in the district give from 2 to 4 qirats. In\r\nsituation and appearance the Beris wells do not differ essentially\r\nfrom those already described, so that we may pass on to a brief\r\nnotice of the village.\r\n\r\nNothing of particular interest is to be met with in Beris, the chief\r\nvillage of the southern part of the oasis. It is rather exposed,\r\nand many of the streets are consequently dusty; in fact some of\r\nthose on the north side are deep in blown sand. Thick groves of\r\ndate-palms enclose the village on the east and south sides, but\r\nnot on the north. The cultivated lands lie partly to the north\r\nand partly to the south-east, but are ineffectual in protecting\r\nthe village from the dust-laden northerly winds, except to a small\r\nextent when the fields are under full crops. The village well is\r\nAin el Hushi, a large bubbling pool some 15 metres in diameter,\r\nsituated in the palm-groves immediately south of the village.\r\n\r\nSolidly-built rectangular mud-brick buildings are found alongside\r\nmost of the larger wells in the Beris district, and a modern\r\nvisitor would have some difficulty in guessing to what use they\r\ncould ever have been put. They were, as a matter of fact, erected\r\nby the Egyptian Government during the time of the Dervish raids,\r\nto serve as block-houses for the garrisons maintained in the oasis\r\nfor the purpose of protecting the wells and villages. During this\r\nperiod several notables and petty officials in this and the oasis of\r\nDakhla were carried off by the Dervishes into captivity in the Sudan.\r\n\r\nMaks Bahari, the next place to the south, is a tiny little hamlet\r\non the southern slope of a sandy eminence, with extensive clay lands\r\nstudded with numerous doum-palms, but without water to irrigate more\r\nthan a small portion of these. The village well is on the south\r\nside, and yields about 80 gallons per minute. As usual, it forms\r\na pool contained by a bank, the latter being cut periodically to\r\nallow of the well being cleared of sediment.\r\n\r\nAfter the winter crops are harvested in the spring, it appears\r\nto be the general practice for the cultivators to pay special\r\nattention to their water-supply. The retaining banks are cut and\r\nthe water allowed to drain off at the lowest level possible, the\r\nwells being sometimes left in this condition for several months,\r\nso that they gradually clean themselves with a minimum of trouble\r\nto their owners. The mud, exposed on the sides of the basin,\r\ncontinually slides downwards into the central pool, and is carried\r\naway in suspension by the outflowing water.\r\n\r\nDrift sand has been very destructive in the neighbourhood of Maks\r\nBahari. At Ain Bella, 2½ kilometres to the N.N.W., there are at\r\npresent only a few acres under cultivation, but the tract anciently\r\ntilled is seen in the eroded remnants of an alluvial platform to\r\nthe north and north-east; this is now a deeply-grooved and ridged\r\nhummocky area of loam, full of dead palm-stubs, with rootlets\r\nramifying in every direction. The original terrace appears to\r\nhave extended far to the north, the portion now remaining being\r\ncomposed of alternating layers of sand and clay, dipping steeply\r\nto the south. At the present day many of the cultivated terraces\r\nare not only being gradually raised by the continual deposition\r\nof wind-borne materials, but are being extended horizontally,\r\nowing to the constant additions of layers of sand and clay-dust\r\nto the steeply-inclined southern or lee faces. In many respects\r\nthe growth of these terraces is analogous to that of sand-dunes,\r\nthough, unlike the latter, the northern portions of the terraces\r\nare practically stationary.\r\n\r\nAt one time or another many wells existed to the west, but are\r\nnow buried in the dunes, their former presence being testified\r\nby isolated exposures of arable land and by occasional trees and\r\nbushes. The dunes, following their natural S.S.E. course in the\r\ndirection of the prevailing winds, seem to be still encroaching on\r\nthe belt of country occupied by the existing wells and cultivated\r\nlands, and it is probably only a matter of time, perhaps a few\r\nhundred years, before they blot out the whole of the south part of\r\nthe oasis. The sand speedily envelops any settlements which are\r\nabandoned, as nothing encourages the formation of dunes to such\r\nan extent as vegetation, and this nearly always abounds in the\r\nneighbourhood of the wells.\r\n\r\nThere is little to commend itself to notice at Maks Qibli, the\r\nsouthern of the two hamlets of the same name; there are scattered\r\ndoums, several groves of date-palms, and small patches of cultivation\r\nirrigated by isolated wells, all on high ground. Here, as elsewhere\r\nin this part of the country, much land has gone out of cultivation,\r\nthough it must be mentioned that the villagers are rather progressive\r\nin planting trees and maintaining small vegetable gardens.\r\n\r\nDush lies out of the main line of villages, being 10 kilometres east\r\nof Maks Qibli, not far from the eastern wall of the oasis. It is\r\na pretty little place, with small clumps of palms, and two white\r\nSheikhs’ tombs on the north side. Ain el Burrda, the big well\r\nimmediately alongside the village, ceased flowing about three years\r\nago, to the great grief of the inhabitants, who now have to carry\r\ntheir water from Ain el Karm, itself barely running. Fortunately,\r\nthe great Ain Johar, situated to the south but irrigating land\r\nto the north, continues to discharge with unabated vigour. More\r\nconspicuous than the village is the ancient Qasr Dush, occupying\r\nthe summit of a small hill to the east. This will be noticed later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUSH VILLAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe wells attached to the hamlets of Dush and Maks mark the limits\r\nof the oasis to the south. The most southerly running well of any\r\nimportance is Ain el Qasr, though Ain Zaha el Din, still farther\r\nto the south, just trickles, and irrigates a tiny area of not more\r\nthan a few square metres. Ain Mabrûka, a kilometre south of the\r\nlast-mentioned well, is overgrown with green weed, and surrounded\r\nby a patch of tamarisk, short prickly scrub, and two or three wild\r\npalms. This is the most southerly point at which exposed water\r\nis to be seen, though in the midst of a large area of scrub still\r\nfarther to the south a sanded-up well of the name of Ain el Terfai\r\nis reported to exist.\r\n\r\nThe scrub-covered area of Ain el Terfai is about 25 kilometres\r\nsouth of Beris. To the south the surface gradually rises, and is\r\nabsolutely devoid of vegetation, the oasis-depression having given\r\nway to the true desert. The next available water is at a place called\r\nNakhail, 60 kilometres to the S.S.E.; the water there is good, but\r\nonly exists in small quantities, obtainable in one or two spots by\r\ndigging to a depth of a couple of metres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                THE OASIS UNDER PERSIAN AND ROMAN RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious Descriptions of Archæological Remains — Mr. Lythgoe’s\r\nExcavations — Dr. Ball’s Report — Article by Professor\r\nSayce — Prehistoric Period — Earliest Historical Records —\r\nPersian Domination — The Army of Cambyses — Temple of Hibis —\r\nGræco-Roman Period — Qasr el Ghuâta — The Roman Emperors —\r\nProclamations on the Temple of Hibis — Qasr Dush — Nadûra —\r\nRuins at Ain Amûr — Qasr Zaiyan and the Town of Tchonemyris —\r\nRoman Fortresses — Dêr el Ghennîma — Qasr Lebekha and Um el\r\nDabâdib — Monasteries — Watch-Tower in Bellaida — Introduction\r\nof Christianity — The Christian Necropolis — Representations\r\nof Biblical Scenes and Personages — Embalming — Celebrities\r\nbanished to the Oasis — The Columbaria — Olympiodorus describes\r\nthe Fertility of the Oases under the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe archæological remains of the oases have been referred to,\r\nand in some cases described in more or less detail, by most of\r\nthe travellers who have left any records of their journeys in\r\nthe Libyan Desert. Among the latter may be mentioned Cailliaud,\r\nHoskins, Schweinfurth, and Brugsch. At the same time, compared with\r\nthe antiquities of the Nile Valley, those of the oases have received\r\nscant attention; indeed, it is only within the last year or two that\r\nany systematic excavations have been undertaken. At the present\r\ntime Mr. Lythgoe, assisted by Mr. Winlock, is excavating in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Christian Necropolis, for Mr. Pierpont Morgan,\r\non behalf of one of the American museums, and the results promise\r\nto be of the greatest interest and importance. It is to be hoped,\r\ntherefore, that, in a few years, we shall be in possession of a\r\ndetailed and authoritative account of the history of the oasis\r\nduring the last few thousand years, as it must be admitted that\r\nthe only information available at the present day is woefully\r\nscrappy and in many respects unreliable. Ball, in his report on\r\nKharga published in 1900, gave an excellent summary of all that\r\nwas at that time known concerning the antiquities, together with\r\na number of useful plans of the chief buildings. Since that date,\r\nwith the exception of a press article by Professor Sayce, little,\r\nif anything, has been published.\r\n\r\nWithout making any pretensions to special archæological knowledge,\r\nI shall attempt to give a brief sketch of the past history of the\r\noasis, at the same time drawing the reader’s attention to the\r\ndistribution and general characters of the more important remains.\r\n\r\nAlthough the oasis of Kharga was doubtless inhabited in prehistoric\r\ntimes, as, indeed, is shown by the existence of flint implements of\r\nPalæolithic type on the surrounding plateaux, and also to a lesser\r\nextent within the depression, no graves referable to the prehistoric\r\nperiod of Egyptologists—_i.e._, the period immediately preceding\r\nthat known as the first dynasty, when Menes united Egypt about 3,300\r\nB.C.[4]—have as yet been discovered. But while it is known that\r\nthe Egyptian kings claimed the allegiance of the inhabitants of\r\nthe oases as far back as the eighteenth dynasty (1545-1350 B.C.),\r\nthe earliest known monumental records in Kharga date from a much\r\nlater period—_i.e._, the twenty-seventh dynasty—when Egypt was\r\nunder Persian domination.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Cambyses, in an endeavour to subdue the\r\ninhabitants of the outlying oases, lost a large portion of his\r\narmy in the Western Desert, probably somewhere to the west or\r\nnorth-west of Kharga. The Persian monarch had recently defeated\r\nthe Egyptian king, Psammetikh III., at Pelusium, and made Egypt\r\na Persian province. On his arrival at Thebes some 50,000 men were\r\ndetached from the main army proceeding to Ethiopia, and ordered to\r\nmarch against the Ammonians and burn the oracular temple of Jupiter\r\nAmmon. This abortive expedition into the Libyan Desert is described\r\nby Herodotus (‘Thalia,’ 26) as follows:[5]\r\n\r\n“The men sent to attack the Ammonians started from Thebes,\r\nhaving guides with them, and may be clearly traced as far as\r\nthe city Oasis, which is inhabited by Samians, said to be of the\r\ntribe Æschrionia. The place is distant from Thebes seven days’\r\njourney across the sand, and is called in our tongue ‘the Island\r\nof the Blessed.’ Thus far the army is known to have made its way;\r\nbut thenceforth nothing is to be heard of them, except what the\r\nAmmonians, and those who get their knowledge from them, report. It\r\nis certain they neither reached the Ammonians, nor ever came back to\r\nEgypt. Further than this, the Ammonians relate as follows: that the\r\nPersians set forth from the Oasis across the sand, and had reached\r\nabout half-way between that place and themselves, when, as they were\r\nat their midday meal, a wind arose from the south, strong and deadly,\r\nbringing with it vast columns of whirling sand, which entirely\r\ncovered up the troops, and caused them wholly to disappear. Thus,\r\naccording to the Ammonians, did it fare with this army.”\r\n\r\nIn modern times considerable doubts have arisen as to which oasis\r\nwas the objective of this army, and certainly the description\r\nof Herodotus is such as to admit of various conclusions being\r\ndrawn. Rohlfs considers that Dakhla, not Siwa, was its goal,\r\nand remarks that, however light-headed Cambyses might have been,\r\nhe could hardly have been so foolish as to have chosen Thebes as\r\nthe starting-point of an army destined for Siwa. The same writer\r\npoints out that a temple dedicated to Ammon does exist in Dakhla,\r\nand that the distance of the latter oasis from Thebes corresponds\r\nwith the ten days mentioned by Herodotus. Vivien de St. Martin (“Le\r\nNord de l’Afrique dans l’antiquité,” 1863, pp. 40-41) had,\r\nsome twelve years previously, come to somewhat similar conclusions.\r\n\r\nAscherson, on the other hand, regards it as highly improbable that\r\nDakhla, which was hardly known and certainly of little importance in\r\nthe time of Cambyses, could have been the objective of so dangerous\r\nand difficult an undertaking, and points out, moreover, that the\r\ntemple of Ammon in that oasis dates from much later (_i.e._, Roman)\r\ntimes. He further remarks that Parthey (‘Das Orakel und die Oase\r\ndes Ammon,’ Abhandl. der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin,\r\n1862, S. 131-194), in a contemporaneous work, had already met the\r\nobjections raised by Vivien de St. Martin. According to the ancient\r\nmaps the distance from Memphis to Siwa was much the same as that\r\nfrom Thebes to Siwa. No reliance, moreover, can be placed on the\r\ndistances given by Herodotus. Judged with reference to Thebes,\r\nthe country of the Ammonians certainly agrees more or less with the\r\nposition of the oasis of Dakhla; but considered in relation to Augila\r\n(a place which has retained its name unchanged up to modern times),\r\nit corresponds with the modern Siwa, where the well-known oracular\r\ntemple of Jupiter Ammon actually existed.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me quite reasonable to suppose that Cambyses only\r\ndecided on the despatch of this expedition after reaching Thebes,\r\nand from there the route, via Kharga, Dakhla, and Farafra, would\r\nbe fairly direct, and have the advantage of passing through oases,\r\nwell provided with water and food-supplies, separated by marches\r\nnot exceeding four days. Possibly, moreover, the ‘oasis’ through\r\nwhich the army is recorded to have safely marched may not have been\r\nKharga at all, but Baharia, or even Farafra, either of which would\r\nhave been reached by striking into the desert along one of the roads\r\nleaving the Nile Valley in the neighbourhood of Assiut or Mellawi;\r\nthis would have been quite a likely route for an army starting for\r\nSiwa from Thebes, as over a third of the distance would have been\r\nalong the fertile plains bordering the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, however, seems to favour the view that the army\r\nproceeded westwards from Thebes, and passed safely through Kharga,\r\npossibly also through Dakhla; in those days the latter may have\r\nbeen coupled with Kharga, as it was later, when the two together\r\nwere called the Great Oasis. As it is impossible to imagine a\r\nbody comprising 50,000 men being destroyed by a sandstorm, I am\r\ninclined to agree with Hoskins that the army was purposely misled\r\nand sacrificed by the guides, with the object of preventing the\r\ncapture of Siwa and the destruction of the far-famed temple of\r\nJupiter Ammon. In the deserts to the north and west of Dakhla\r\nimmense accumulations of sand cover, without a break, thousands of\r\nsquare miles of country; only one or two possible tracks cross this\r\nlonesome wilderness, and these, following narrow troughs hemmed\r\nin by hills of sand, are invisible even from the distance of a\r\nfew hundred yards. Only a party thoroughly acquainted with desert\r\ntravelling could hope to penetrate this region, and nothing would\r\nbe easier than to encompass the loss of a large and unwieldy army\r\namong these terrible dunes. It seems probable, moreover, that this\r\nbody of troops was as ill-equipped and badly led as the main army\r\nwhich at the same time was marching southwards to Ethiopia. Led by\r\ncircuitous routes till they reached a point many marches distant from\r\nthe nearest well, worn out by the incessant clambering over endless\r\nridges of soft sand, their stores of water and food exhausted,\r\ntheir tracks obliterated by the ever-moving sand, the fate of the\r\nunfortunate soldiers, deserted at the last by the treacherous guides,\r\ncould not long have remained in doubt.\r\n\r\nThe Persians left a magnificent record of their rule in the temple\r\nof Hibis, situated 4 kilometres north of Kharga village. Founded\r\n(or possibly only rebuilt) by Darius I. between 521 and 486 B.C.,\r\nin honour of the god Ammon-Ra, it was enlarged by Nektanebos\r\nabout 150 years later. In the hieroglyphics the King is mentioned\r\nas having built the temple of good white stone, and as having\r\ncovered its portals, made of Libyan acacia-wood, with bronze from\r\nAsia. There are long lists and representations of the offerings made\r\nto Ammon-Ra the sun-god, commencing with the wine of the oasis. The\r\nbuilding is situated in the midst of fields and palm-groves, and\r\nthe accompanying illustrations give a good idea of its general\r\naspect and architecture. The main portion has its long axis east\r\nand west, and measures 44 by 19 metres, the walls being about\r\n6 metres high. To the east of the chief entrance there are three\r\nisolated pylons, one of them being at the present day almost hidden\r\nby palms. The entire building is constructed of Nubian Sandstone,\r\nbelieved to have been obtained locally, though the quarry has\r\nnever been located. Hibis means ‘the town of the plough,’\r\nand is referred to in the Ptolemaic inscriptions at Edfu as the\r\ncapital of Kenem (Kharga). It is not certain whether the town,\r\nwhich probably existed into the Middle Ages, was in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the temple, or, as suggested by Rohlfs, near Nadûra,\r\na smaller edifice on a marked eminence a little to the south-east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEMPLE OF HIBIS.]\r\n\r\nApart from the temple of Hibis most of the antiquities in the\r\noasis belong to the Græco-Roman period, and probably the most\r\ninteresting and important of these is the temple now known as\r\nQasr el Ghuâta, situate 6 kilometres south-east of Gennâh, on\r\na conspicuous eminence composed of sandstones and shales. Qasr\r\nel Ghuâta dates from the time of the Ptolemies, and, as the\r\ncartouche of Ptolemy III. (Euergetes I.) appears on the entrance\r\nwalls, it may be presumed that it was erected during his reign,\r\nbetween 247 and 222 B.C. The actual temple is of sandstone, and\r\nmeasures approximately 10 by 20 metres, the main entrance being\r\nrichly inscribed and having ornamental columns with beautifully\r\ndesigned capitals. The interior consists of three courts or\r\nrooms, the first plain, the second with four ornamental columns\r\nand walls decorated with exceptionally well-cut hieroglyphics,\r\nwhile the third is much smaller, and contains enclosed passages\r\nand cells. The building is hemmed in by numerous crude enclosures,\r\nwith partitions of sun-dried brick, the whole of which, forming a\r\nlarge rectangular block, was originally surrounded by a high brick\r\nwall of considerable thickness. According to Schweinfurth, the outer\r\ncrude erections formed the quarters of a garrison at a later date.\r\n\r\nIt was during the sway of the Roman Emperors that the Egyptian\r\noases attained their maximum importance. During this period, from\r\n30 B.C. to about the beginning of the seventh century, extensive\r\ntowns existed in Kharga, and the oasis was strongly garrisoned and\r\nprotected by forts. Temples and other edifices were erected, while\r\na great development of the water-supply took place. During the same\r\nperiod the oases were used as places of banishment, just as they\r\nwere in earlier days under the Pharaohs, and have been, in a way,\r\nin quite modern times. Juvenal, the Latin satirist, was banished to\r\nSyene at the beginning of the second century, as a punishment for his\r\nattacks on the Court, and he appears also to have been for a time\r\nconfined in Kharga; Athanasius, Nestorius, and other celebrities\r\nlikewise made unwilling acquaintance with this portion of the Empire.\r\n\r\nSayce remarks that the oases under the Romans were thoroughly\r\ncultivated, a brisk trade in wine being carried on, and mentions\r\nthat on one of the temple walls there are several inscriptions which\r\nlead one to infer that Kharga yielded a considerable revenue. One\r\nof the best known, dated in the first year of the reign of the\r\nEmperor Galba (A.D. 68), is a long Greek inscription on one of\r\nthe pylons of the temple of Hibis; this has been carefully copied\r\nby more than one traveller, and translations have been published\r\nby Young, Letronne, and Hoskins. In it the Prefect of the oasis,\r\nJulius Demetrius, communicated the answer of the Governor of the\r\nprovince, Tiberius Julius Alexander, to various complaints made\r\nby the inhabitants, not only of the oasis, but of other districts\r\nunder the same jurisdiction. The proclamation admits the justice\r\nof the complaints, and lays down at great length the steps to be\r\ntaken in regard to the appointment of tax-gatherers, the payment of\r\ndebts, and imprisonment for various offences; it deals with deeds\r\nof sale, the marriage portions of women, rents, military service,\r\nlegal appeals, the punishment of libellous informers, etc.; forbids\r\nextortion and exorbitant taxes; orders the restitution of illegally\r\nexacted moneys; and ordains that taxes are to be based on the extent\r\nof the Nile inundation.\r\n\r\nA still earlier inscription, on the southern portion of the same\r\npylon, refers especially to the inhabitants of the oasis, and is\r\ntranslated by Hoskins as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Cnœus Virgilius Capito says: I have both heard long ago some\r\n  unjust expenses and false charges to be made by certain persons\r\n  avariciously and shamefully abusing their powers: and I have just\r\n  now been informed, that in the territory of the Libyans certain\r\n  things are consumed by those seizing them under pretence, as it\r\n  were, because of their necessities, as being set apart for their\r\n  expenses and entertainments; which charges are neither true nor\r\n  admissible: and in like manner under the name of the service\r\n  of couriers. Wherefore I command those travelling through the\r\n  nomes, soldiers, and horsemen, and serjeants, and centurions,\r\n  and tribunes, and all others, to take nothing nor to exact the\r\n  privileges of couriers, except certain have my warrants; and these\r\n  passing along only indeed to be accommodated with lodging: and\r\n  that it be laid down, that no man do any thing, beyond what were\r\n  established by Maximus. But if any individual may give, or consider\r\n  any thing as given, and exact as for the public service, I will\r\n  exact ten times the amount of what he has exacted from the nome,\r\n  and give a fourfold portion to the informer out of the property of\r\n  the condemned. The royal scribes, and the village clerks, and the\r\n  clerks of the districts in each nome, shall keep a register of all,\r\n  that is expended by the nome upon any one: that, if this or any\r\n  thing else has been irregularly committed, they may be recorded,\r\n  and may repay sixty-fold. But the inhabitants of the Thebaid may\r\n  for four months come up to the tribunals of accounts: and let\r\n  them address themselves to Basilides, the freedman of Cæsar,\r\n  an officer of the tribunal of accounts, and to the comptrollers;\r\n  that, if any thing may be adjudged or done contrary to what is\r\n  just, I may in like manner put this in order.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are interesting side-lights on life in the oasis in those days,\r\nand show that the people were well treated by their highly gifted\r\nforeign rulers, who, as is well known, respected the customs and\r\nreligion of the Egyptians and, other nations over whom they ruled.\r\n\r\nAlthough there exists in the neighbouring oasis of Dakhla a temple\r\nerected during the reign of Vespasian, the earliest Roman temple\r\nin Kharga is probably Qasr Dush, the ancient Kysis, erected by\r\nTrajan in A.D. 117, and dedicated to Isis and Serapis. The temple,\r\nstanding in the midst of the ruins of a town, occupies the summit of\r\na hill a couple of kilometres north-east of Dush. The main building,\r\nconstructed of stone, has its long axis north and south, and measures\r\n15 by 7½ metres. It is preceded by a forecourt, in front of which\r\nare two pylons, the first bearing a Greek inscription relating the\r\ndate of its erection. Hoskins gives the following translation of\r\nthis inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “For the fortune of the Lord Emperor Cæsar Nero. . . . Trajan\r\n  Optimus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus, under Marcus Ruffinus Lupus,\r\n  Governor of Egypt, to Serapis and the supreme gods, those of\r\n  [Cyrene?] having written, erected from a principle of piety this\r\n  building. The nineteenth year of the Emperor Cæsar Nero Adrian\r\n  Optimus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere appears originally to have been a colonnade between the\r\nfirst and second pylons, but only fragments of the columns exist\r\nat the present day. The front of the forecourt is covered with\r\nhieroglyphics, while the interior is unsculptured except at the\r\nportal leading to the main hall, the latter measuring 6 by 5½\r\nmetres, and having four columns. On the west side there is an\r\nentrance leading to an inclined passage. The northern part of the\r\nbuilding consists of a central semi-divided portion flanked by two\r\nelongated chambers, all of which have arched roofs. A parapet is\r\nformed by the external walls of the temple, while the roof over\r\nthe three southern chambers is at a lower level than that of the\r\nmain hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEMPLE OF HIBIS (INTERIOR).]\r\n\r\nThe temple proper is in the western portion of an immense rectangular\r\nenclosure bounded by very thick walls of sun-dried brick; these\r\nwalls at the present day are in a very bad state of preservation, but\r\nappear to have been of the type common in some similar buildings in\r\nthe north of the oasis— _i.e._, hollow at the top, so as to enclose\r\na passage by means of which the custodians could make the circuit\r\nof the building without descending, and from which, unobserved\r\nfrom the exterior, they had the advantage of a splendid view of\r\nthe surrounding country. The measurements and details which I have\r\ngiven above are largely taken from Dr. Ball’s report, to which the\r\nreader is referred for plans and sections of this and other temples.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous ruins in the oasis is the little temple\r\nof Nadûra, situated on a hill 1 kilometre south-east of the temple\r\nof Hibis. The inner building is of sandstone, and roughly measures\r\n8 by 11 metres, while the outer portion, bounded by walls of unburnt\r\nbrick, is very much larger. According to Sayce, the temple was built\r\nby Hadrian between A.D. 117 and A.D. 138. Brugsch, however, refers\r\nit to a somewhat later date, considering it to have been erected\r\nby Antoninus Pius. Several smaller ruins in the neighbourhood are\r\nprobably referable to the same period as the temple itself.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Qasr Zaiyan, 5½ kilometres north-east of Bulaq,\r\nenclose a small sandstone temple of somewhat doubtful age, though\r\na Greek inscription over the entrance records that the building\r\nwas restored by Antoninus Pius and dedicated to Amenebis (Ammon of\r\nHibis), god of Tchonemyris, the ruins of which town exist in the\r\nvicinity. The inscription is translated by Hoskins as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “To Amenebis, the supreme god of Tchonemyris, and to the associated\r\n  gods of the temple, for the eternal preservation of Antoninus\r\n  Cæsar our Lord, and his whole house. The cell of the temple and\r\n  the vestibule were repaired and renewed under Avidius Heliodorus,\r\n  governor of Egypt; Septimius Macro being commander-in-chief,\r\n  Plinius Capito being general of the forces, in the third year of\r\n  the Emperor Cæsar Titus Ælius Adrianus Antoninus Augustus, the\r\n  Pious. Mesore the eighteenth.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Antoninus Pius reigned from A.D. 138 to A.D. 161, but\r\nantiquities unearthed from the ruins show that the town dates from\r\nthe time of the Ptolemies and flourished into the Byzantine period.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above the dilapidated ruins of what were\r\ndoubtless once imposing buildings exist at various points within\r\nthe depression. One worthy of attention will be noted at Ain Amûr\r\nby travellers to Dakhla along the upper road. The exact age of the\r\nbuilding is uncertain, though Wilkinson discovered thereon a portion\r\nof the name of one of the Cæsars. The small stone temple stood,\r\nlike so many others in the oasis, in a courtyard enclosed by thick\r\nwalls of unburnt brick, the fragmentary remains of which are visible\r\nin the illustration. The names of the principal deities inscribed\r\non the temple walls are Kneph, Ammon, and Mut. Both Edmonstone\r\nand Wilkinson came to the conclusion that the temple is of greater\r\nantiquity than the majority of the monuments of the oasis; but I\r\nam inclined to believe, with Hoskins and Rohlfs, that its somewhat\r\ncrude design is explicable on other grounds than that of age.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable and imposing buildings in the oasis\r\nare the great Roman fortresses, among which may be mentioned Um\r\nel Dabâdib, Qasr Lebekha, and Dêr el Ghennîma. Possibly some\r\nof these were fortified monasteries, though until the ruins, as\r\nwell as those of the extensive towns and cemeteries which existed\r\nin the neighbourhood, have been subjected to critical examination,\r\ntheir exact nature must remain in doubt. The so-called Dêr, near\r\nthe foot of Jebel Ghennîma, was certainly a fort guarding one of\r\nthe chief passes up the escarpment of the oasis. It is built of\r\nimmensely thick walls, strengthened intermediately and at the four\r\ncorners by enormous buttresses. The walls taper slightly upwards,\r\nand at the top are double, concealing a passage which ran round the\r\nentire building. In the centre of the court was a deep bore from\r\nwhich the inmates obtained their water, the surplus supply flowing\r\nthrough an underground conduit to the cultivated lands outside.\r\n\r\nQasr Lebekha, situated in a lonely part of the depression under\r\nthe northern escarpment, 12 kilometres north-west of Meheriq,\r\nhas many points in common with the fortress just described. It is,\r\nhowever, much smaller, and its interior is completely filled with\r\ndomed chambers, now falling into shapeless fragments.\r\n\r\nThe impressive ruin at Um el Dabâdib, 36 kilometres N.N.W. of\r\nKharga, seems to me to have been a fortified monastery, the interior\r\nbeing filled with vaulted cells. Its appearance is quite distinctive,\r\nlacking as it does the round buttresses of Qasr Lebekha and Dêr\r\nel Ghennîma, though the walls are still of great thickness,\r\nand loopholed for defence. Outside are the remains of a town of\r\nconsiderable size, and here doubtless several hundred workmen were\r\nquartered when the extensive subterranean waterworks, which exist\r\nin the locality, were in course of construction.\r\n\r\nA fourth large ruin, of somewhat similar architecture, occupies\r\na conspicuous position on the edge of the escarpment overlooking\r\nthe Bellaida district, about 2 kilometres north of the temple of\r\nHibis. Ball describes this under the name of Qasr Ain Mustapha\r\nKashef, a name which, of course, merely refers to its position\r\nnear a well of that name. The interior consists of tiers of arched\r\nchambers, and according to Schweinfurth there is little doubt that\r\nthe building was a monastery.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned forts and monasteries are built of large\r\nsun-dried bricks measuring, as a rule, 35 × 17 × 9 centimetres, and\r\nit is noteworthy that the walls, where of exceptional thickness,\r\nwere built in sections, perhaps to allow of their drying more\r\nreadily. Besides those described, a great many other mud-brick\r\nbuildings are to be found scattered through the oasis, the majority\r\nof which possess no very distinctive features. One, however,\r\nbeing sure to attract the attention of visitors may be specially\r\nreferred to; this is a high rectangular tower occupying a very\r\nconspicuous position on the open plain to the west of Jebel Têr,\r\nmeasuring 5 by 6½ metres at the base, the walls tapering slightly\r\nupwards to a height of about 15 metres. It was originally divided\r\ninto storeys and provided with a staircase, and may very probably\r\nhave been used as a watchtower. The remains of a circular brick or\r\npottery kiln are to be seen twenty paces to the south.\r\n\r\nThe exact age of these numerous brick buildings cannot be stated\r\nwith certainty, and we can only hope that when the pottery,\r\ncoins, and other objects which exist in the ruins of the adjoining\r\ntowns have been systematically collected and examined, it may be\r\npossible to date them with more accuracy. At present we can only\r\nconjecture that while the greater number were erected during the\r\nRoman occupation, between 30 B.C. and A.D. 395, some of them may date\r\nfrom the succeeding Byzantine period. Many of the cemeteries contain\r\nmummy-cases on which the likeness of the deceased is carved in wood\r\non the outside, or fashioned in stucco and painted in colours. Three\r\nof these from an ancient burial-place in the Bellaida district,\r\nbetween Jebel Têr and Jebel Tarif (one of a number of cemeteries\r\nof Roman age which await the attention of archæologists), are\r\nshown in one of our illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHRISTIAN NECROPOLIS.]\r\n\r\nChristianity was introduced into Egypt in the early part of the\r\nRoman domination, and spread rapidly through the country, although\r\nthe national Egyptian or Coptic Church was not established until\r\nA.D. 451. Judging by the size and importance of the cemetery at\r\nthe south end of Jebel Têr, and by the numerous monasteries,\r\nChristianity must have had a great following in the oasis of\r\nKharga. During this period many of the temples in Upper Egypt were\r\nconverted into churches, and it was not until A.D. 640, when the\r\nCaliphs conquered the country, that Christianity began to wane.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Necropolis lies 1 kilometre north of the temple of\r\nHibis, on the southern extremity of the foot-hills of Jebel Têr. The\r\ncemetery, known at the present day as ‘El Baguat,’ consists of a\r\ngreat number of tombs built of unburnt brick, the majority showing\r\na considerable amount of architectural decoration. The buildings\r\ncover a large area, and are to a certain extent laid out in streets,\r\nwhich, as Ball remarks, give the place the appearance more of a\r\nstrange deserted town than of a graveyard. Some are small tombs,\r\nnoticeable for their simple beauty; others are large mausolea\r\nand sanctuaries, richly ornamented with columns, pilasters, and\r\narches. Almost without exception the tombs are surmounted by domes,\r\nthough, owing to the walls being carried up beyond the base of the\r\ndome, the latter is not always conspicuous from the outside.[6]\r\nThe interior walls are invariably plastered and whitewashed,\r\nand covered with numerous Greek and Arabic inscriptions, the old\r\nEgyptian ‘Tau,’ the sign of eternal life, being frequently\r\ndisplayed. In addition, the walls and domes are in some cases\r\nornamented with crude coloured designs. The pictures have,\r\nunfortunately, been mostly hacked to pieces or covered by Arabic\r\nwritings, so that there are now only two tombs in which the original\r\npaintings are anything like intact. On the dome of one of these,\r\nnear the south end of the cemetery, a number of familiar Biblical\r\npersonages are represented in colours, their names being inscribed\r\nin Greek characters immediately above. Adam and Eve, Noah, Abraham,\r\nSara and Isaac, Christ, Paul, and others are clearly distinguishable.\r\n\r\nThe actual grave is below the centre of the floor of each tomb. The\r\nbodies, which mostly appear to have been embalmed and wrapped in\r\ncloth, have in many cases been plundered of ornaments and thrown\r\nout. Even at the time of Hoskins’ visit in 1837 the majority\r\nof the tombs had been ransacked, and at the present day there\r\nare probably few left intact. With regard to the practice of\r\nembalming, Hoskins writes: “It is highly satisfactory that we\r\nhave such indubitable evidence to enable us to establish the fact,\r\nthat the custom of embalming the dead was continued by the first\r\nprofessors of the Gospel in Eastern Africa. The introduction of\r\nChristianity produced great and sudden changes in the minds, habits,\r\nand customs of believers; but a length of time was no doubt often\r\nnecessary to root out many of the prejudices of the people; and\r\nit is very possible, that the practice of embalming may have been\r\ncontinued as a necessary mark of respect to the dead, long after\r\nthe doctrine had been entirely exploded, in accordance with which\r\nthe custom had been originally established. This practice, however,\r\neven in the most ancient times, was not confined to the worshippers\r\nof Amun. The physicians of Egypt were forty days in embalming Jacob;\r\nand Joseph also was embalmed in Egypt.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIBLICAL SCENES IN A TOMB OF THE NECROPOLIS.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot speak with certainty as to the exact period during which\r\nthis cemetery was in use. In the course of the reign of Constantius\r\n(337-361), Athanasius, the champion of the doctrine of the Trinity,\r\nwas several times expelled from Alexandria and compelled to take\r\nrefuge in the Libyan Desert, where there were numerous monasteries,\r\nwhich afforded safe asylums from the followers of Arianism and\r\nPaganism. Hoskins states that the name of Athanasius occurs in\r\none of the Theban sepulchres, and he believes that “the ruined\r\nmonasteries in the Oasis Magna were, probably, the abode of the\r\ngreat champion of the Christian religion.”\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of the Emperors Arcadius and Honorius numerous\r\npersonages, including the general Timasius, were exiled to the\r\nGreat Oasis, described by a writer (Zosimus) as “a barren place\r\nwhence no one could escape when once carried thither; for the way\r\nbeing sandy, desert, and uninhabited, no one can find it, the wind\r\ncovering the traces of people’s feet, nor is there any tree or\r\nhouse to guide them.”\r\n\r\nNestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, was excommunicated and banished\r\nto the oasis in A.D. 434 by the Patriarch Cyril of Alexandria,\r\nand probably the necropolis contains the tombs of a large number\r\nof his followers. The Bishop, however, did not die in Kharga, as\r\nhe was carried thence into captivity by the Blemmyes, the ancestors\r\nof the Bisharin and Ababdeh Arabs, and died, after suffering great\r\npersecutions, at Panopolis (Akhmîm) about the year 440. It is\r\ninteresting to note that certain Christian customs and festival\r\ndays are still observed in the oasis at the present time.\r\n\r\nRuins of columbaria are of frequent occurrence in many parts of\r\nKharga, and judging from the size and shape of the bricks used,\r\nbelong to the same period as the forts and monasteries. They are\r\ngenerally of considerable size, the inner walls being built so as to\r\nprovide tiers of cubical niches to serve as nesting-places for the\r\npigeons. Examples may be seen at Ain el Burg and Ain Tabashîr in the\r\nMeheriq district; in the Bellaida country, and near Ain Khenâfish;\r\non the slopes of the Gorn el Gennâh; and near the village of\r\nDush at the south end of the oasis. These ancient pigeon-houses\r\nare called ‘Burg’ by the natives, the Arabic name for dovecot\r\nbeing ‘Burg Hamâm.’\r\n\r\nThat the oases were very flourishing under the Roman Empire\r\nis shown by Olympiodorus, who lived in the reign of Theodosius\r\nII. (A.D. 408-450), and was born in Upper Egypt. Writing of the\r\nGreat Oasis, he calls attention to its salubriousness, to the\r\nabundance of sand everywhere, and to the numerous wells, which,\r\nsunk to a depth of 200, 300, or even 500 cubits,[7] pour forth\r\nstreams of fresh water at the surface, which is used in rotation by\r\nthe owners for the irrigation of their fields. Barley, he avers,\r\nis sometimes sown twice a year, and millet almost always three\r\ntimes. Writing of the irrigation, Olympiodorus remarks that in this\r\nregion the sky is always cloudless, and that the great fertility\r\nof the land is attributable to the fact that the peasants water\r\ntheir little enclosures every third day in summer, and every sixth\r\nin winter. The same writer states that dials were made in the oasis.\r\n\r\nThe presence of marine shells in the rocks of the surrounding\r\ndeserts led Olympiodorus to conjecture that the oasis was formerly\r\nan island, separated by the sea from the rest of Egypt, and he\r\nrecalls the fact that the place was called by Herodotus ‘the\r\nIsland of the Blessed.’\r\n\r\nStrabo writes of the Libyan Desert thus: “This continent resembles\r\na panther’s skin, as being spotted with inhabited districts,\r\ninsulated in the midst of a sandy soil and arid deserts; the\r\nEgyptians call these cantons ‘Auasis.’” He refers to the\r\nGreat Oasis as follows: “In a parallel line with Abydus, and\r\ndistant about three days’ journey across the desert, we find the\r\nfirst of the three Oases of Lybia; it is a spot well inhabited,\r\nwell supplied with water, and producing wines and other commodities\r\nin sufficient abundance.”\r\n\r\nWith the withdrawal of the Roman garrisons and the Mohammedan\r\nconquest decay set in, and, as Sayce remarks, the aqueducts became\r\nchoked, the fields were neglected, and malarial fever invaded a\r\ndistrict which had at one time been regarded as a health resort.\r\n\r\nOf the history of the oases during the succeeding seven or eight\r\ncenturies no records are available, but, judging from the writings\r\nof Arabian geographers, between the eleventh and the fifteenth\r\ncenturies, it is evident that they gradually became depopulated, and\r\nwere regarded as of little importance. El Sherîf el Edrissi, writing\r\nabout the middle of the sixth century of the Hegîra, refers to the\r\noases (Al Vahat) as places formerly containing streams of water,\r\nwith lands on which trees were still found growing, and with ruined,\r\nuninhabited towns. He adds that the goats and sheep had become quite\r\nwild, and were trapped by hunters like other wild animals. It is\r\nnot improbable, however, that this author was referring to some of\r\nthe smaller oases-depressions, such as Kurkur, or perhaps to some\r\nof the more outlying parts of Kharga or Dakhla. It seems extremely\r\nunlikely, as Hoskins remarks, that the Great Oasis as a whole had\r\nbecome entirely uninhabited.\r\n\r\nStill later the emir and historian Ismail Abulfida, about the\r\nbeginning of the fourteenth century, speaks of the oases as abounding\r\nwith palms and running water, and describes them as situated like\r\nislands, in the middle of the desert, three days’ journey from the\r\nSaid (Upper Egypt). Jacutus describes the positions of three oases,\r\nand refers to the first of them as being well cultivated, containing\r\nstreams and hot springs, palms and cultivated lands. The inhabitants,\r\nhe adds, are in a wretched state. Several other writers allude\r\nto the Egyptian oases, but their information is seldom, if ever,\r\nfirst hand, and the descriptions are in general so vague that we\r\nare left in doubt as to which particular oasis their remarks refer.\r\n\r\nThe more modern records, commencing with those of Poncet at the\r\nend of the seventeenth century, have already been referred to in\r\na previous chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                    THE EXTINCT LAKES OF THE OASIS\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacter and Extension of Lacustrine Deposits — Modern Erosion\r\nby Wind-borne Sand — The Lakes geologically of Recent Age\r\n— Discovery of Pottery and Bones of Domesticated Animals —\r\nArea occupied by the Lakes — Maximum Level of their Waters —\r\nLacustrine Strata at Gorn el Gennâh — Relation to the Ancient\r\nMonuments — Altitudes of Archæological Sites — Age of the Lakes\r\nand their Persistence into Historic Times — Flint Implements\r\n— Origin of the Lakes — Their possible connection with the\r\nArtesian Waters — Lacustrine Deposits form the Cultivated Lands\r\nof Modern Times.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in 1906 I commenced to make a special study of the geology\r\nof the oasis, with a view to elucidating certain questions which\r\nhad arisen in connection with the water-supply, it came to me as a\r\nvery great surprise to find indubitable evidence that the greater\r\npart of the floor of the depression had at one time or another been\r\nthe site of an immense lake. No mention had been made by previous\r\nobservers of the extensive accumulations of lacustrine sediments\r\nwhich cover so large a proportion of the floor, and are found from\r\nnear Ain el Ghazâl in the north to beyond Beris in the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LACUSTRINE DEPOSITS AT EL GALA, NEAR BULAQ.]\r\n\r\nThese deposits consist of horizontal finely-bedded alternations\r\nof sand and clay, or more frequently of an intimate mixture of the\r\ntwo; local false-bedding is not uncommon, and included fragments of\r\nlimestone or sandstone are occasionally met with. The beds have a\r\nprevailing brown tint, and frequently exhibit well-marked hexagonally\r\ndisposed shrinkage cracks. Although originally they must have formed\r\nan immense compact and continuous sheet, the deposits have since\r\nbeen subjected to considerable denudation, so that at the present\r\nday they exist as large isolated patches. Perhaps the most striking\r\nof these is that occupying the centre of the depression between\r\nKharga village and Jebel el Ghennîma, covering an area of between\r\n40 and 50 square kilometres, and over the greater part cut by the\r\nsand-blast into thousands of isolated hummocks, disposed with their\r\nlonger axes parallel and in the direction of the prevailing north\r\nwinds. Individual hummocks have perhaps an average height of 4 or\r\n5 metres, though many exceed this considerably; in length they\r\nmay measure anything up to 40 or 50 metres. The northern end of\r\na hummock is in nearly all cases the larger, the gradual tapering\r\ntowards the south being a most distinctive feature. Their present\r\nshape and appearance are, of course, entirely due to the eroding\r\nand sculpturing action of sand-laden wind.\r\n\r\nThe finding of these extensive lacustrine deposits naturally opened\r\nup a number of questions of the greatest interest and importance. To\r\nwhat level had the waters of the lake attained; what were its limits\r\nhorizontally; and, most important of all, at what period had it\r\nexisted, and what were its relations to the ancient monuments of\r\nthe oasis? With the object of solving these problems it has been\r\nmy endeavour to collect all possible information concerning the\r\ndeposits, and, although it is perhaps too soon to draw inferences\r\nwith any great certainty, I propose to put on record such data as I\r\nhave been able to obtain, and to indicate the conclusions to which\r\nthey appear to lead.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, obvious that the lake was, geologically speaking,\r\nof comparatively recent date; the lacustrine deposits have nothing\r\nin common with those of the Cretaceous and Eocene formations which\r\nbuild up the plateau-massif out of which the oasis-depression is\r\nhewn. The sands and clays are much softer and less consolidated beds,\r\nlaid down superficially and unconformably on the uneven surfaces of\r\nthe older formations; the depression had, in fact, almost attained to\r\nits modern dimensions before the beds in question were formed. My\r\nfirst impression was that the lake dated from prehistoric, if\r\nnot prehuman, times; that it existed before the prevailing desert\r\nconditions set in, when the Nile Valley was the site of extensive\r\nlakes and the country was partially wooded. The existence of thick\r\ndeposits of calcareous tufa on the upper portions of the cliffs\r\nof the depression suggested a considerable outpouring of water\r\nfrom springs, and it seemed not improbable that the surplus water\r\ncollected on the floor of the depression below.\r\n\r\nFor some time I was unable to discover any clue to the age of the\r\ndeposits, in the shape of organic remains or human relics. Then, in\r\na pit sunk for surface-water in the neighbourhood of Headquarters,[8]\r\nsome fragments of pottery were found at the base of the deposit. This\r\ndiscovery was followed by the finding of other pieces of pottery\r\nfirmly embedded in some of the clay hummocks to the south-west of\r\nHeadquarters. These were without question _in situ_, and proved\r\nthat the lake was contemporaneous with man.\r\n\r\nFurther search, in which I was greatly assisted by my friend\r\nH. H. Baker, M.B., led to the discovery of human settlements,\r\napparently on the margins of the lake. In these localities large\r\nquantities of broken pottery were found associated with the bones\r\nof domesticated animals, while the fresh-water gastropod shell,\r\n_Melania tuberculata_, was found to be abundant in some of the\r\nbeds. Careful exploitation of one or two of these sites, about\r\n6 kilometres south-west of Headquarters, enabled us to procure a\r\nnumber of complete earthenware vessels, the chief types of which\r\nare shown in one of our illustrations. A comparison of these with\r\npottery of known age must be left until we have referred to the\r\nhorizontal and vertical extension of the lake.\r\n\r\nJudging from the still existing deposits, and utilizing (in the\r\nnorthern part of the oasis) a considerable number of levels,\r\nI believe the limits of the lake to have been as shown on the\r\naccompanying plan. From its most northerly point in lat. 25°\r\n45′ N., in the neighbourhood of the modern Ain el Ghazâl, its\r\nwestern boundary trended S.S.W., passing about 1½ kilometres west\r\nof Meheriq village to the south-west end of Jebel Têr; thence\r\nits shore-line lay at the foot of Jebel Tarwan, rounding which it\r\nprojected somewhat into the Bellaida district between Jebel Têr and\r\nJebel Tarif. South of this it bore slightly west of south, passing\r\nabout 2½ and 3 kilometres west of Kharga and Gennâh villages\r\nrespectively. From the latter point the shore-line proceeded almost\r\ndue south to lat. 25° 2′ N., in the vicinity of Ain Girm Meshîm.\r\n\r\nIts eastern limit appears to have been about a kilometre east of\r\nAin el Qasr, and some three times that distance east of Meheriq, so\r\nthat on this latitude the lake had a breadth of 4½ kilometres. In\r\nthe neighbourhood of Headquarters its margin lay 2 kilometres to the\r\neast, whence it ran almost due south for about 12 kilometres. Here,\r\njust to the south-west of Ain Harrân, the lake attained its greatest\r\nwidth—_i.e._, 15 or 16 kilometres, gradually diminishing southwards\r\nto Ain Girm Meshîm. The total length of this portion of the lake\r\nwas just over 80 kilometres.\r\n\r\nBoth at Ain Girm Meshîm and Ain el Doum the lacustrine deposits are\r\nwell seen; over the intermediate country they were not observed, and\r\nas this area lies at a somewhat high elevation, it seems probable\r\nthat there was a break in the continuity of the lake of about 15\r\nkilometres in extent.\r\n\r\nThe southern portion appears to have measured approximately 45 by\r\n15 kilometres, its long axis lying along a line passing through Ain\r\nel Doum, Beris, and Maks Qibli. To the south-east the lake had a\r\nlocal extension in the neighbourhood of Dush. It is thus seen to\r\nhave extended, with a possible break of a few kilometres in the\r\ndistrict near Ain Girm Meshîm, almost throughout the length of\r\nthe depression, over a distance of 136 kilometres, or 85 miles.\r\n\r\nIt proved a matter of some difficulty to determine the maximum\r\nheight to which the lake had reached, as in most localities the\r\ndeposits have suffered considerable denudation, and their margins are\r\nusually obscured by blown sand and superficial detrital material. The\r\npottery to the south-west of Headquarters was ascertained to occur\r\nat 47 metres above sea-level, the uppermost limit of the deposits\r\nin that area being 62 metres. At Headquarters the lake clays occur\r\nup to between 65 and 66 metres; at Ain Terfai and Ain Mahmud, north\r\nof Meheriq, to 65 and 67 metres respectively. Still farther north I\r\nfound there were stretches of similar clays at 76 metres near Ain el\r\nQasr, and at 84 to 85 metres in the neighbourhood of Ain el Ghazâl.\r\n\r\nOn the west side a very well-defined plain formed of the lake beds\r\noccurs immediately to the east of the Necropolis, and was found to\r\nlie at 70 metres above sea-level. But the most valuable data of all\r\nwere those obtained at the Gorn el Gennâh. There, as anticipated,\r\nthe lacustrine deposits, containing _Melania_ and _Limnæa_ in\r\nabundance, were found to be well developed and exposed, being piled\r\nup on the flanks of the hill on its north, east, and south sides,\r\nthe exact limits of the beds being best seen on the south-east side\r\nnear the ruins of a columbarium. Immediately behind the latter the\r\ntop of the stratified clays was determined as 66½ metres, a figure\r\nagreeing remarkably closely with the majority of the maximum heights\r\nfarther north. Still higher up, however, are other clays, which,\r\nwhile similar in general appearance, are either very irregularly\r\nbedded or altogether unstratified. The upper limit of these clays\r\nwas found to be 82·76, or, say, 83 metres. While these highest beds\r\nmay possibly have been deposited by the waters of springs issuing\r\nfrom faults and fissures (the line of disturbance mentioned in a\r\nprevious chapter passes through the Gorn at this point), one must,\r\nin the absence of any definite evidence to the contrary, regard them\r\nas probably representing the extreme marginal deposits of the lake.\r\n\r\nWe may, indeed, conclude that, while the lake presumably at one time\r\nreached to a maximum level of 85 metres, it stood for a considerable\r\nperiod at about 70 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFIN-MASKS FROM BELLAIDA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT POTTERY FROM THE LACUSTRINE DEPOSITS.]\r\n\r\nThe next step was to ascertain the altitudes of the archæological\r\nsites and the relation of the latter to the lacustrine deposits. Up\r\nto the present time levels have not been carried through to the south\r\nend of the oasis, and aneroid determinations are not of sufficient\r\naccuracy for our purpose, so that we must confine our attention\r\nin this connection to the northern portion of the depression. The\r\nground-level of the temple of Hibis was found to be at 75 metres\r\nand the lowest of the tombs of the Necropolis at 80·6 metres above\r\nsea-level. The columbarium already alluded to, on the south-east\r\nside of the Gorn el Gennâh, is built on the denuded slopes of\r\nthe lacustrine series at a level of 57·2 metres, while the base\r\nof a number of brick ruins a little to the north was found to be\r\njust over 53 metres. Finally, the ground-level at the base of the\r\nslope on which stands Qasr Zaiyan was determined as 21 metres, a\r\nbench-mark being made on the southern door of the temple at 24·52\r\nmetres above sea-level.\r\n\r\nThere are several points in connection with the disposition of\r\nthe archæological remains which cannot but strike one. In the\r\nfirst place, they are mostly on or near the extreme margin of the\r\nlacustrine deposits; secondly, they are absent altogether from the\r\ncentral portion of the lake site; and thirdly, the older monuments\r\noccupy the highest levels, while there are no representatives at\r\nall of the earlier Egyptian periods. While the disposition of the\r\nmonuments may, of course, be entirely fortuitous, we are justified,\r\nI think, in assuming that the lake existed well into the historic\r\nperiod, and may have still stood at the 65 or 70 metre level when\r\nthe temple of Hibis was erected by Darius, about 500 years before\r\nthe commencement of the Christian era. In the time of the Ptolemies\r\nit was certainly considerably lower, while in still later days,\r\nwhen the country became a Roman province, the lake had very much\r\ncontracted, and probably only existed as a marshy swamp occupying\r\nthe lower portions of the depression.\r\n\r\nWhat age, it may be asked, is indicated by the pottery, bones,\r\nand fresh-water shells which, as already mentioned, have been\r\nfound in the lacustrine deposits? Unfortunately the shells belong\r\nto species which have a wide distribution, and have persisted from\r\nearly Pleistocene times right up to the present day. They do not,\r\ntherefore, help us to fix the age of the deposits, except within\r\nwide limits. The bones were submitted to Dr. Andrews, F.R.S., of\r\nthe British Museum Staff, and his conclusion is that they belong\r\nto two domesticated animals—one a small, lightly-built ox, the\r\nother a small horse, donkey, or zebra; unfortunately they are not\r\nsufficiently complete to be determined with certainty. Finally,\r\nas to the pottery: the types do not differ in any important respect\r\nfrom those associated with the towns and cemeteries of Græco-Roman\r\nage in many parts of the oasis. The barrel-shaped pot has, indeed,\r\npersisted to modern times, being, in a slightly different design,\r\nthe standard water-jar at the present day in the oasis of Dakhla. The\r\npottery, therefore, bears out our conclusions that the lake continued\r\nto exist well into the historic period.\r\n\r\nAlthough flint implements have never yet been detected _in situ_\r\nin the lacustrine deposits, I have collected a considerable\r\nnumber from the area originally occupied by the lake. Some of\r\nthese were found lying on the denuded surfaces of the lake beds,\r\nin positions which lead me to suppose that they have weathered out\r\nfrom the deposits. They are decidedly Neolithic in workmanship and\r\ncharacter, and were, in my opinion, used by people inhabiting the\r\ndepression at the time of, and probably prior to, the existence of\r\nthe lake. A number of examples are shown in one of the accompanying\r\nplates; the figure in the bottom left-hand corner is, however,\r\nthat of a palæolith, a typical example of those which occur on the\r\nborders of the plateau, and on or near the eastern escarpments. In\r\nthe right-hand bottom corner is figured an object of very common\r\noccurrence in the oasis—a sandstone hand-grinder, probably of\r\nRoman age. With the exception of these two the specimens illustrated\r\nare all implements from the site of the lake. Flint implements\r\nwere evidently in use in Kharga at a very late period, as large\r\nnumbers of worked flints, mostly in the form of flakes or tools of\r\nvery poor finish, occur near many of the old sanded-up wells. A\r\nconsiderable amount of detailed work will have to be undertaken\r\nbefore the different flints of the oasis can be satisfactorily\r\narranged in chronological order.\r\n\r\nFrom what period did the lake date, and to what cause did it owe its\r\norigin, are questions which cannot, I fear, be definitely answered\r\nas yet. While it is quite reasonable to consider, in the absence\r\nof any decisive evidence to the contrary, that the lake originated\r\nin early prehistoric or Pleistocene times—that it dates possibly\r\nfrom the time of the formation of the tufas of the Nile Valley and\r\noasis-escarpment, when the climate was certainly much moister than\r\nat the present day—we must not forget the possibility that it\r\nwas formed by artificial means during one or other of the Egyptian\r\ndynasties between 3000 and 1000 B.C.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe that the depression was inhabited\r\nprevious to the formation of the lake, and although we have no\r\ninformation as to when the first deep borings were made, there is\r\nsome evidence which leads me to suspect that wells existed prior to\r\nthe time when the surface of the lake began to fall, if not very\r\nmuch earlier. The evidence to which I refer is the discovery of a\r\nportion of an earthenware pipe embedded _in situ_ in the lake clays\r\nat a height of 42·85 metres, of the type used by the ancients for\r\nlining their water-channels. Is it possible, therefore, that, as the\r\nresult of the industry of the ancient well-borers— following their\r\ninitial discovery of these deep-seated sources—the long-confined\r\nwaters welled up with irresistible force, and gradually flooded\r\nthe country. At the present day, when the pressure throughout the\r\nartesian basin must be very much less than formerly, it is not\r\nuncommon for new bores to get out of control and flood considerable\r\nareas of country. The same thing may possibly have happened on a\r\nvery much larger scale thousands of years ago, when the first bores\r\nwere sunk into a previously untapped artesian basin, fully charged\r\nwith water under great pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLINT IMPLEMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThere is another explanation which it is advisable to keep in mind,\r\nthough it has never hitherto, as far as I am aware, been advanced\r\nas a possible cause of the formation of lakes. The very existence of\r\nartesian water depends on the presence of porous strata overlain by\r\nimpermeable beds. If one or other of the porous beds, charged with\r\nwater under pressure, should, through the action of denudation on\r\nthe overlying beds, become exposed at the surface, the waters would\r\nescape through natural springs in very large quantities. This might,\r\nindeed, continue for a long period of time, until the bed was nearly\r\ndepleted and the pressure reduced to nil. There is little doubt that\r\nthe beds which we have named the ‘Surface-water Sandstone,’\r\nand which are now exposed in places on the floor of the oasis,\r\nwere originally entirely covered by impervious clays, and contained\r\nartesian water under pressure; they may, in fact, have been in the\r\nsame condition as is the Artesian-water Sandstone at the present\r\nday. It is conceivable, therefore, that when those beds became\r\nexposed at the surface, owing to the removal of the overlying\r\nconfining strata, their contained waters escaped in such quantities\r\nas to have given rise to a lake of considerable dimensions, if not\r\nto one equal in size to that which we have been considering.\r\n\r\nNo one can be more conscious than myself of how much there is still\r\nto be learnt regarding the topographical aspects of the oasis\r\nin early historic times, and although the theory that the lake\r\nmay have been formed by waters which escaped from the underlying\r\nwater-charged beds (either artificially through bore-holes or\r\nnaturally as springs) may at first sight appear fanciful, it is\r\none which, in the present imperfect state of our knowledge, is\r\nat least worth bearing in mind. A more detailed examination of the\r\nlacustrine deposits would probably throw further light on the matter;\r\nand a minute analysis of the nature, composition, and arrangement of\r\nthe individual grains would almost certainly show whether the beds\r\nhave in the main been formed of sediment carried into the lake by\r\nstreams from the neighbouring cliffs and plateaux, or whether they\r\nrepresent wind-borne accumulations of sand and clay-dust from the\r\nsurrounding plains.\r\n\r\nAt whatever period and in whatever manner the lake may have been\r\nformed, it is quite clear that it existed well into historic times,\r\nand that on its bed were laid down thick deposits of clay and sand,\r\nwhich at the present day form the bulk of the cultivated lands of\r\nthe oasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                     THE UNDERGROUND WATER-SUPPLY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Water-bearing Strata underlying the Libyan Desert —\r\nEssential Conditions required to produce an Artesian Basin — The\r\nSurface-Water Sandstone — Collecting Pits — Fissures — Yield\r\nof Water — Flowing Wells from this Sandstone — Bores at El Dêr\r\nel Ghennîma — Variable Quality of Water — Ancient Subterranean\r\nAqueducts — The Artesian-Water Sandstone — General Characters\r\n— The Headquarters Area avoided by the Ancients — Drilling\r\nDifficulties — Results of New Bores — Factors determining\r\nDischarges of Wells — Temperature and Chemical Composition of\r\nArtesian Waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen laboriously traversing the hot and arid plateaux of the Libyan\r\nDesert, our thoughts divided between the fertile plains of the Nile\r\nwe have left behind and the still far distant oasis, it is difficult\r\nto realize the presence, within a distance of a few hundred yards,\r\nof an abundant supply of the purest water. Yet there is little doubt\r\nthat the water-bearing beds underlie practically the whole of the\r\nLibyan Desert, though it is only on the floors of the depressions\r\nthat they lie within accessible distance of the surface. On the\r\nhigh tablelands the cost of sinking bores to reach the sandstones\r\nwould be prohibitive, and without the aid of powerful and costly\r\npumps the water would not rise to the level of the ground. But\r\nalthough the subterranean waters of the great desert plateaux\r\ncannot economically be made available at the surface, it must not\r\nbe forgotten that the deeply buried sandstones of these regions must\r\nact to a great extent as storage reservoirs capable of replenishing\r\nthe beds underlying the oases-depressions, from which large volumes\r\nof water are continuously drawn by the numerous artesian wells.\r\n\r\nThe essential conditions required to produce an artesian basin,\r\nwhich, when tapped by borings, will produce self-flowing wells,\r\nare the presence of strata of sufficient porosity to carry water,\r\nenclosed above and below by beds of sufficient impermeability to\r\nprevent the escape of that water; the outcrop of the porous beds\r\nin some higher and distant region, with an adequate exposure to\r\nan abundant source of water, whether rain, river, or lake; and,\r\nfinally, the absence of an easy escape at a lower level, unless at\r\na considerable distance from the sites of the wells.\r\n\r\nThese requirements are well fulfilled in the Libyan Desert, where\r\nthe Nubian Series at the base of the Cretaceous consists of highly\r\nporous sandstones, subdivided by impervious beds of shale, overlain\r\nby a great thickness of absolutely water-tight beds, and underlain by\r\nprobably almost equally impermeable crystalline rocks. These porous\r\nsandstones rise gradually to the south, and presumably outcrop in\r\nNubia and the Sudan, though whether, as we shall see later, they\r\nderive their water-supplies from the Nubian reaches of the Nile,\r\nfrom the great swamp regions of the Sudan, or from the rains of\r\nAbyssinia or Darfur, is still, to some extent, an open question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ARTESIAN WELL (BORE NO. 39).]\r\n\r\nIn Northern Kharga we find two similar but distinct sandstones,\r\nseparated by a 75-metre band of Impermeable Grey Shale. The upper\r\nbed, which we have for convenience designated the ‘Surface-water\r\nSandstone,’ is exposed at the surface, and contains standing or\r\nsub-artesian water; while the lower, from which the flowing wells\r\nderive their supplies, never approaches within 80 metres of the\r\nsurface, and forms the true ‘Artesian-water Sandstone.’ It will\r\nbe convenient to give these sandstones separate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE SURFACE-WATER SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphical position of the Surface-water Sandstone will be\r\nseen by reference to the geological sequence given in a preceding\r\nchapter, and to the section drawn across the oasis. The beds\r\nforming this division have an average thickness of 45 metres, and\r\nconsist almost entirely of fine sandstones or coarser grits, often\r\ncontaining an abundance of oxide of iron, and occasionally beds of\r\nalum and Epsom salts, or, to be chemically exact, hydrous sulphates\r\nof alumina and magnesia. Thin bands of shale are frequently met with,\r\nintercalated in the sandstones, generally near the top or base of\r\nthe series. On the level or gently undulating floor of the oasis,\r\nto the east of the line of disturbance passing through Jebel Têr,\r\nthe Surface-water Sandstone has a wide outcrop, while to the west,\r\nwhere the general level of all the formations is higher, the same\r\nstage forms the foot-hills of Jebel Tarif, of Jebel Têr, and of\r\nthe high cliffs which rise to the north of Um el Dabâdib and Ain\r\nLebekha. It is probable, moreover, that the sandstones which form\r\nthe surface of the desert between Kharga and Dakhla, and which cover\r\nimmense areas to the south of the oases, also belong to this group.\r\n\r\nOver a portion of the floor in the north of the depression these\r\nsandstones have been entirely removed by denudation, so that in\r\nthis area the underlying grey shales form the desert surface. At\r\none time the sandstone was continuous across the depression, and\r\nentirely covered by an impervious mantle consisting of the Purple\r\nShales. It was then, in all probability, fully charged with water\r\nunder pressure, as is the true Artesian-water Sandstone at the\r\npresent day; and it is possible, as we have already suggested,\r\nthat when the sandstones in question were first laid bare by the\r\nactive agents of erosion, innumerable springs broke forth, and\r\ngave rise to a lake of considerable magnitude, which may, indeed,\r\nhave been that which persisted into the historic period.\r\n\r\nIn the district round Headquarters several pits have been sunk\r\nin this sandstone, from which the water is lifted by power for\r\npurposes of irrigation. In six pits the maximum level of the water\r\nvaries from 55·38 to 56·52, the average being 55·74 metres. From\r\nHeadquarters the general surface of the country falls to the north,\r\nsouth, and east, and curiously the water-level in the sandstone\r\nfalls in the same directions. In a pit near Bore No. 43, about 3½\r\nkilometres to the south-west, the water-level is 52·4 metres; at\r\npoints 640 metres and 2 kilometres to the west it was found to be\r\n52·16 and 50·21 metres respectively; while near Bore No. 33, 4\r\nkilometres to the north, the surface-water stands at 52·71 metres\r\nabove sea-level. The ground-levels at these points are 54·54,\r\n57·90, 53·61, and 57·61 respectively, while that at Headquarters\r\naverages 59·57 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\nFor irrigation purposes an ordinary bore-hole or small pit is\r\nquite useless, the inflow of water through the pores of this\r\nsandstone being too slow to yield a pumping supply. When a large\r\npit is excavated, fissures, through which water is seen to be\r\nfreely circulating, are nearly always exposed. Experiments show\r\nthat—provided a sufficiently large collecting-tank is made,\r\nmeasuring, for instance, 5 by 4 metres, and sunk from 1 to 2\r\nmetres below the standing water-level—a supply sufficient to\r\nyield a continuous discharge of 8 gallons a minute (equivalent\r\nto 11,500 gallons per day of twenty-four hours) can frequently be\r\nobtained. Moreover, by sinking a bore to a depth of 7 or 8 metres\r\nfrom the bottom of the pit, preferably on one of the fissures,\r\nthe supply can be increased threefold, the water emerging from the\r\nbore in considerable volume, though with insufficient pressure\r\nto carry it (in a length of well-casing fixed on the top of the\r\nbore-hole) above the level of 55·74. The latter figure may, indeed,\r\nbe regarded as the static head in this neighbourhood of the water\r\nin the Surface-water Sandstone. The fact that from this sandstone\r\nwe are unable to obtain an artesian well at the surface, but can\r\nget flowing water at a depth of a few metres, is an important\r\nillustration of the very slight difference in some cases between\r\nflowing and non-flowing wells, and of their close connection with,\r\nand dependence on, the absolute ground-level.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which this sub-surface source can be drawn on without\r\nlowering its level has not yet been determined, though, in a pit\r\nalongside Bore No. 2, a ‘saqia’ or Persian waterwheel (a native\r\ncontrivance adapted for lifting water, worked by oxen or camels),\r\nhas been working for about eighteen months without appreciably\r\naffecting the supply.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a flowing well can be obtained (in a pit) a few\r\nmetres below ground-level, and under certain conditions it may be\r\npossible to obtain flowing wells at the surface from the sandstone\r\nunder consideration; the occurrence of artesian water at El Dêr\r\nel Ghennîma, on the east side of the depression, may, indeed, be\r\na case in point. To the east of Headquarters, as may be gathered\r\nfrom the section, the Surface-water Sandstone dips gently under\r\nthe Purple Shales, the thickness of the latter increasing as the\r\neastern escarpment is approached. Running north and south through\r\nEl Dêr is an anticlinal fold, and flowing water is obtainable\r\nfrom wells sunk on its crest through the shales to the underlying\r\nsandstone. The original depths of the ancient wells in this district\r\ncannot be determined with certainty, but when one of those to the\r\nnorth of the ruined fort was cleaned out and cased, flowing water\r\nwas obtained when the drill reached a depth of 41 metres. Below\r\nthis the ground appeared to be untouched, the bore being carried a\r\nfew metres deeper into fresh sandstone, which yielded an increased\r\nsupply. This well has given a steady discharge of about 40 gallons\r\na minute for over eighteen months. Quite recently the flow has been\r\naugmented to just over 50 gallons per minute by its outlet being\r\nlowered about 1½ metres, to 92½ metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe water here seems to be derived from the Surface-water Sandstone,\r\nthough, considering that the well is situated on a line of folding,\r\nit would not be advisable to entirely disregard the possibility\r\nof the presence of fissures, through which the water might rise\r\ndirectly from the Artesian-water Sandstone below. If, as appears to\r\nbe the case from the depth and position of the bore, the water does\r\nhave its origin in the Surface-water Sandstone, the explanation\r\nmay be that the necessary working head or pressure is furnished\r\nby the difference of level of the sandstone here and in adjacent\r\ndistricts. In the extreme north of the oasis the same sandstone lies\r\nat a considerably higher level, and, at the same time, holds large\r\nvolumes of water, and it may be that the pressure of this water,\r\nacting on that contained in the beds at lower levels, gives rise\r\nto flowing wells when bores are sunk in favourable localities.\r\n\r\nA very great drawback to the water of these upper sandstones is\r\nits variable quality. In the Headquarters district it is usually\r\nmore or less ferruginous, and in some pits may contain as much as\r\n63 grains of dissolved solids per gallon, the salts consisting of\r\niron, potash, and soda, with traces of lime and magnesia, mostly\r\nin the form of sulphates and chlorides. Mr. William Garsed[9] has\r\ncalculated that this water would, if used for irrigation at the\r\nrate of 3 gallons a minute per acre, effect an annual deposition\r\nof over 3 tons of sulphate of potash and common salt on each acre\r\nof land. Salts of this nature in such quantities would, of course,\r\nhave a very deleterious effect on the crops, not to mention the\r\nmechanical binding action of the iron on the soil.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the want of uniformity in the quality of the water is\r\ndue to local causes, chief of which may be the relative abundance of\r\nfissures, the purity of the sandstone, and the presence or absence\r\nof mineralized shales. In those areas where the water is moving\r\nonly slowly—where, in fact, it tends towards stagnation in the\r\nstrata—it is probably liable to become more or less highly charged\r\nwith mineral salts; certainly the best qualities seem to coincide\r\nwith relative abundance, and the largest supplies are undoubtedly\r\nfound where the beds are traversed by fissures.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the oasis perfectly sweet water is obtainable from\r\nthe sandstones of this series, and this source, as an auxiliary to\r\nthe artesian supplies obtained from deep borings, was taken full\r\nadvantage of in olden times. The ancients constructed the most\r\nmarvellous systems of subterranean aqueducts to tap these sources,\r\nmore especially in the neighbourhood of Um el Dabâdib, Qasr Lebekha,\r\nand Qasr Gyb, where such works were especially applicable, owing to\r\nthe fact that the sandstones in those districts form extensive hills\r\nabove the general level of the surrounding cultivable ground. These\r\nunderground works are, in many respects, of far greater interest than\r\nthe ancient monuments, and they will therefore be fully described\r\nin a later chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE ARTESIAN-WATER SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\nThe source of the great majority of the flowing wells of the\r\noasis is the group of sandstones underlying the Impermeable Grey\r\nShales. Although the beds of the series are nowhere visible to the\r\neye, their general characters can be judged by an examination of the\r\nmaterial brought to the surface during drilling operations. The\r\nsamples prove that, in general lithological characters, the\r\nArtesian-water Sandstones do not essentially differ from those just\r\ndescribed. Throughout the area over which boring operations have\r\nrecently been carried out no well-defined, continuous, argillaceous\r\nbands have been met with, though lenticular intercalations of\r\nclayey strata are not uncommon. Up to the present time the base\r\nof the Artesian-water Sandstone has not been reached, although\r\nthe deepest borings have been carried down to a depth of 122\r\nmetres below its junction with the confining shales above. The\r\ndifferent bands vary considerably in coarseness and porosity,\r\nin hardness, and in the amount of cementing material between\r\nthe individual grains of the rock, all of which characters have\r\na marked influence on their capacity as water-carriers. Judging\r\nfrom their unfossiliferous nature, from the presence of thin seams\r\nof lignite associated with bands and nodules of iron pyrites, and\r\nfrom certain other considerations, we are led to infer that these\r\nsandstones were originally laid down on the bed of an immense inland\r\nfresh-water lake.\r\n\r\nDuring the past half-century the natives have put down a considerable\r\nnumber of deep bores in this and the neighbouring oasis. No written\r\nrecords concerning these are, however, available, so that in seeking\r\ninformation one has to rely on the memory of the men who sunk the\r\nwells. By careful cross-questioning I have collected a large amount\r\nof interesting and valuable information, but still, in describing the\r\nartesian wells themselves, it will be more satisfactory to confine\r\nour attention to those which have been drilled on the Headquarters\r\narea during the last two or three years, and of which accurate and\r\nreliable records have been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Headquarters area, occupying the central part of the depression\r\nbetween Kharga village and Jebel el Ghennîma, is one of the few\r\nlarge districts entirely devoid of old wells and traces of former\r\ncultivation. A combination of unfavourable circumstances appears to\r\nhave led the ancient well-borers to avoid this district. Firstly,\r\nthe general elevation is comparatively high, meaning small flows\r\nfrom wells of ordinary depth; secondly, the superficial alluvial\r\ndeposit is clayey and heavy, necessitating a considerable expenditure\r\nof time and labour to bring it into satisfactory condition for\r\ncultivation; and, thirdly, and probably most important of all,\r\nthe presence of a copious supply of sub-surface water, which would\r\nhave greatly hampered, if not made impossible, the sinking of wells\r\nby the ancient system.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be assumed that, owing to the entire absence of\r\nboth ancient and modern wells, the sandstones of this district\r\nwere practically fully charged with water at the time the first\r\nbore was sunk.\r\n\r\nThe junction of the Artesian-water Sandstone with the grey\r\nshales above is usually fairly abrupt, the first flowing water\r\nbeing obtained as soon as the drill strikes the top of the\r\nsandstone. Where alternating sandstones and shales occur at or\r\nnear the junction, the former are generally charged with water\r\nunder feeble pressure, yielding flows at the surface of from 1\r\nto 5 gallons a minute. Sometimes, indeed, the piercing of these\r\nthin bands, prior to the main body of sandstone being entered,\r\nmerely results in a rise of water in the bore-hole, without actual\r\nflow. On drilling into the sandstone proper, increments of the\r\nflow are obtained at fairly frequent, though irregular, intervals\r\nof depth. At times the discharge is seen to increase slowly but\r\nsteadily, while a particularly porous bed is being passed through;\r\nat others the rate of increase is so rapid as to suggest that a\r\nfissure charged with freely flowing water has been struck. As a rule,\r\nhard beds of sandstone, (the ‘shells’ of American drillers)\r\noverlie the best water-carrying layers, and though these act\r\nlocally as confining beds, there almost certainly is, nevertheless,\r\nan intimate connection between different parts of the sandstone,\r\nas no persistent argillaceous bands have been met with.\r\n\r\nLoose uncemented sands may be encountered at any time, but\r\ndo not seem to coincide with marked increases of flow. These\r\n‘quicksands’ form one of the greatest difficulties with\r\nwhich drillers have to contend, and many bores have perforce to be\r\ndiscontinued owing to the impossibility of drilling through them. The\r\nloose sands ‘cave’—that is, run in from all sides—the whole\r\nwall of the bore at times falling in, throughout a length of 5 or 10\r\nmetres. The only remedy against caving is the insertion of casing,\r\nbut this is generally undesirable, as it may effect the shutting off\r\nof water already obtained from the upper bands of the sandstone;\r\nin some cases, however, perforated lining may be satisfactorily\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nOf thirty-one bores finished in this district, none has failed to\r\nstrike water, though three have yielded such small flows that they\r\nmay be regarded as comparative failures. The average flow of the\r\nthirty-one wells, the measurements being made in each case a week\r\nor two after completion, was approximately 100 gallons a minute,\r\nthe maximum being 315 and the minimum 18 gallons per minute. All\r\nbores have shown a marked decline in discharge for some time after\r\ncompletion, when, if isolated, they have settled down to a fairly\r\nsteady flow, or at least to a flow which decreases at a constantly\r\ndiminishing rate.\r\n\r\nOwing to the very adverse effect of some of the larger bores\r\n(situated on the lower parts of the area) their flows have\r\nbeen purposely reduced; and as a further precaution against\r\nover-exploitation, and as a remedy to the waste consequent on\r\nirrigation at night, all wells are, as far as possible, shut down\r\nbetween sunset and sunrise. The average discharge, therefore, at the\r\npresent day is considerably less than the figure mentioned above,\r\namounting, in fact, to approximately 70 gallons a minute per bore.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important factor determining the volume of flow is\r\nthe absolute ground-level at the mouth of the well. The floor of\r\nthe oasis in the district in question lies between 53 and 61 metres\r\nabove sea-level, the general slope being to the west, in the opposite\r\ndirection to the dip of the water-bearing sandstones. Although the\r\nactual difference of level is so little, amounting only to 7 or 8\r\nmetres, the difference of flows from wells of equal depth on either\r\nside of the area averages fully 100 per cent. This indicates that the\r\nsurface of this area is very near the static head or limit to which\r\nwater will rise from bores of this depth; in fact, if the ground were\r\nraised by a very few metres, not one of the wells would discharge\r\nat the surface. This I have proved by actual experiment, and it is,\r\nmoreover, borne out by the observed pressure, which even in the best\r\nwells seldom amounts to more than 13 or 14 pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\nBefore going further into this important matter of pressure, let\r\nus briefly notice the temperature and chemical composition of the\r\nartesian water. In Dakhla Oasis the temperature of the wells often\r\nrises as high as 90° or 95° F., the highest recorded being 105°\r\nF. in Bir el Dinaria, a bore sunk fifteen or sixteen years ago,\r\nand the deepest and most northerly in that oasis. In Kharga it is\r\nseldom that we meet with temperatures over 90° F., the well-waters\r\nat Headquarters varying from 86° to 88° F. Identical figures were\r\nobtained in the southern part of the oasis.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable features of the artesian water is its\r\nhighly effervescent character when it reaches the surface. In most of\r\nthe newer bores the water is so strongly charged with minute bubbles\r\nof gas that it closely resembles the contents of a newly-opened\r\nbottle of highly aerated water, while in many of the older wells\r\nthe gas rises to the surface in a slow procession of large bubbles.\r\n\r\nAnalysis shows the gas to consist almost entirely of nitrogen, only\r\nsmall quantities of oxygen and carbon dioxide being present; and it\r\nhas been estimated by rough experiment that the volume of gas issuing\r\nfrom Bore No. 1 (internal diameter, 4¼ inches) amounts to half a\r\npint per minute. My own opinion is that this nitrogen represents\r\nordinary air deprived of its oxygen during the underground passage\r\nof the water, and this explanation seems confirmed by Mr. Lucas,\r\nF.C.S., Chemist to the Egyptian Survey Department, who refers me\r\nto several cases in which air is believed to have been depleted of\r\nits oxygen by pyrites, etc., during its passage underground.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the artesian water is in all respects excellent,\r\nand when taken direct from a cased well forms, after cooling, a\r\npalatable water free from all danger of contamination. Analyses by\r\nMr. Garsed of water samples from four bores show the total dissolved\r\nsolids to range from 43 to 47 parts per 100,000, equivalent to from\r\n30 to 33 grains per gallon. In new bores the water is usually only\r\nslightly ferruginous, though, as already mentioned, in some of the\r\nancient wells of certain districts it is so highly charged with\r\nferric oxide that thick deposits of ochre have been formed along\r\nthe irrigation channels.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of the dissolved salts, so far as\r\ndetermined, is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\nANALYSES OF TYPICAL ARTESIAN WATER OF KHARGA OASIS (HEADQUARTERS\r\nDISTRICT).\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |                         | Bore | Bore | Bore | Bore |\r\n  |                         |No. 1.|No. 2.|No. 5.|No. 6.|\r\n  +-------------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |Total solids (grains per |  33  |  30  |  33  |  32  |\r\n  | gallon)                 |      |      |      |      |\r\n  +-------------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |Composition of dissolved |      |      |      |      |\r\n  |salts, per cent.         |      |      |      |      |\r\n  |  Silica                 | 4·2  | 4·5  | 4·6  | 3·4  |\r\n  |  Ferric oxide           | 1·7  | 0·8  | 1·2  | 1·3  |\r\n  |  Lime                   | 6·5  | 7·0  | 5·4  | 5·6  |\r\n  |  Magnesia               | 2·9  | 3·1  | 2·7  | 3·8  |\r\n  |  Sulphuric anhydride    | 4·5  | 4·9  | 4·4  | 4·4  |\r\n  +-------------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n           FLOWING WELLS: SOME EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Water Discharge of Oasis — Water-Pressures — Static\r\nHead — Importance of Systematic Observations and Records of\r\nBores — Sensitiveness of Wells — Experiments showing Mutual\r\nInterference of Wells — Bores Nos. 5 and 6 — Bores Nos. 4 and\r\n42 — The Wells at El Dêr el Ghennîma — Decline in Discharge\r\nof New Wells — Effect of Closing Bores — Rate of Flow of Water\r\nin Sandstones — Danger of Over-Exploitation — Holding Capacity\r\nand Porosity — Experiments on Porosity of Nubian Sandstone —\r\nLarge Quantities of Water held in Storage Beds — Economically\r\nonly partially available at Surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present day there are about 230 native-owned wells in the\r\noasis, yielding a total discharge of some 295 qirats. We have seen\r\nthat the qirat has not a fixed value, but represents a discharge\r\nvarying from 22 to 38 or more gallons a minute. Applying these\r\nvalues as far as possible to the old wells, and adding the known\r\ndischarge of the new, we shall not be very far from the truth if we\r\nestimate the total discharge of the oasis wells at 8,000 gallons\r\na minute, or 11,500,000 gallons (53,000 cubic metres) a day. The\r\nlargest well in Kharga Oasis is Ain Estakherab at Gennâh, with a\r\ndischarge of between 700 and 800 gallons per minute. The average\r\nyield of those which might be described as the best wells probably\r\ndoes not exceed 150 to 200 gallons, while there are a great many\r\nwhich only discharge 20 or 30 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world the discharges of artesian wells are\r\nmeasured by thousands, not hundreds, of gallons. In Queensland and\r\nother parts of Australia, for instance, there are numerous bores\r\nthrowing over 1,000 gallons a minute; in these regions the depth\r\nof individual bores in many cases amounts to thousands of feet,\r\nthe pressure frequently rising as high as 100 pounds to the square\r\ninch. It must, moreover, be borne in mind that the artesian basins\r\nof Australia have only been exploited during a comparatively short\r\nperiod, and that from the nature of the country the wells are,\r\nas a rule, at considerable distances apart.\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of the artesian basin of the Libyan Desert has been\r\nin progress for hundreds and thousands of years, and it is probable,\r\ntherefore, that in the oases-depressions the general average pressure\r\nhas been very much reduced. At the present time the water-pressures\r\nseldom exceed a very few pounds per square inch, so that the static\r\nhead, or absolute height to which the water will rise, is seldom more\r\nthan a few metres above the actual surface of the ground. The outlets\r\nof the native wells are, unfortunately, of such a nature that it is\r\nnot possible to make even approximate determinations of pressure;\r\nbut after taking into account the influence of ground-level on the\r\nvolume of flow, we still find differences which point to there being\r\nconsiderable variation in the absolute static head in different\r\nparts of the oasis—that is to say, the water will rise higher in\r\nsome places than in others. This is probably partly to be accounted\r\nfor by variations in the level of the underlying strata and by the\r\npresence of faults—for instance, the static head to the west of\r\nthe central line of disturbance is certainly considerably higher\r\nthan to the east.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of accurate data, the static head in a district can\r\nbe approximately gauged from the ground-level and flow of any one of\r\nthe higher and more isolated wells. The maximum static head judged\r\nin this way appears to be 88 metres above sea-level in the Kharga\r\ndistrict on the west side of the fault; but in the Headquarters\r\narea, to the east of the fault, it can be definitely proved to be\r\nvery much less.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the extent of the local variations throughout\r\nthe district where the recent boring operations have extended,\r\nI carried out a number of experiments. For this purpose four bores\r\nin different parts of the area were selected, of similar diameters,\r\nand of approximately equal depths into the water-sandstone. By means\r\nof a flange the casing of each bore was carried vertically upwards,\r\nthe ordinary outlet being kept shut until the pressure ceased to\r\nrise, as indicated by a pressure-gauge. It was then found that in\r\nBore No. 36 the water had risen to 61·6 metres, in Bore No. 38\r\nto 59·55, in Bore No. 42 to 64·26, and in Bore No. 44 to 62·0\r\nmetres above sea-level. The average static head in this district\r\nmay therefore be taken as 61·85 metres. The positions of the four\r\nbores in question, with regard to Headquarters, are as follows:\r\nNo. 36, 7·7 kilometres N.; No. 38, 2·6 kilometres N.W.; No. 42,\r\n1·6 kilometres S.E.; and No. 44, 3·9 kilometres W.N.W.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Meheriq the static head appears to rise, as flowing\r\nwells are found up to 76 metres above sea-level (Ain Mohammed\r\nDelaib). The water-level at Ain el Ghazâl is even higher (84·56),\r\nbut this well does not actually run.\r\n\r\nIn the development of an artesian basin this question is of the\r\nutmost importance; only by a knowledge of the static head and the\r\nground-level can we, with any likelihood of success, estimate\r\nbeforehand the discharge to be looked for in any particular\r\ndistrict. If, for instance, we sink a bore in a locality whose\r\nsurface is above the static head, the result, so far as a flowing\r\nwell is concerned, can only be failure, however great the amount\r\nof water existing in the underlying strata. If a sufficient number\r\nof observations are available, it is possible to construct charts\r\nshowing the isopotential lines, or lines of equal pressure,\r\nand these may be of great value when boring is contemplated in\r\nintermediate districts.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that accurate records of bores are preserved in the\r\ninitial stages of the development of new artesian basins, and to\r\nthis neglect is due much of the doubt which frequently arises at\r\na later period as to the extent and permanence of the underground\r\nwater-supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORE NO. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORE NO. 14.]\r\n\r\nIn some countries, however, the water-resources have long been the\r\nsubject of exhaustive examination, notably in the United States,\r\nwhere a most valuable and instructive series of water-supply reports\r\nhas been issued by the Geological Survey. The chief difficulties\r\narise from the fact that bores are generally the property of private\r\nindividuals, who are seldom both able and willing to supply accurate\r\ninformation. Discharges, for instance, are usually given in the\r\nroundest of figures, and without regard to the conditions under\r\nwhich they were taken. In Australia more than one geologist has\r\ncalled attention to the matter, and quite recently Mr. G. H. Knibbs,\r\nF.R.A.S., of the University of Sydney, in a valuable and suggestive\r\npaper on the hydraulic aspect of the artesian problem, refers to the\r\nwant of comprehensive and deliberate investigation in the past, and\r\nadmits the inadequacy of the available data for the determination\r\neven of the one question only—_i.e._, the extent to which\r\nexploitation can be pushed without fear of exhausting the supply.\r\n\r\nWhen drilling was first commenced in the Headquarters area, the\r\nbores were placed at an average distance apart of 500 metres;\r\ncircumstances, however, led to there being a considerable\r\nvariation in the depths of the wells, with the result that those\r\nof shallow depth and those situated on comparatively high ground\r\nwere adversely affected by the deeper and more favourably placed\r\nbores. The sensitiveness of any one well to the influence of its\r\nneighbours is, I believe, far greater than is generally supposed,\r\nand appears to be especially dependent on the amount of difference\r\nbetween the depths, discharges, and surface-levels of the bores. In\r\ninvestigating this subject I made a number of experiments with the\r\nobject of determining the mutual influence of wells, and perhaps\r\nsome reference to these may not be without interest and value.\r\n\r\nThe first experiment to which I shall refer was made on wells\r\nsituated comparatively close together. Bore No. 5 is 570 metres\r\nW.S.W. of Bore No. 6, the outlet of the former being at 57·38,\r\nthat of the latter at 59·18, a difference of 1·8 metres. No. 5\r\nhas an internal diameter of 5⅝ inches, is 197 metres deep and 95\r\nmetres into the water-sandstone; No. 6 has a diameter of 8 inches,\r\nis 146 metres deep, and 61 metres into the sandstone. The two\r\nwells had been flowing continuously for a considerable period,\r\nand during the experiment neighbouring wells were kept shut down,\r\nso that there is no reason to suppose that the observations were\r\naffected by other bores.\r\n\r\nBore No. 5, discharging 114 gallons a minute, was shut down at\r\n7 p.m. on June 12, 1907, and reopened at 7 a.m. on June 13. The\r\nhourly observations, as given in the following table, show the\r\neffects produced on Bore No. 6.\r\n\r\n           EXPERIMENT TO SHOW MUTUAL INTERFERENCE OF BORES.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------++-------------------------------+\r\n  | Bore No. 5 closed at 7 p.m.,  || Bore No. 5 opened at 7 a.m.,  |\r\n  | June 12, 1907.                || June 13, 1907.                |\r\n  +-----+---------+-----+---------++-----+---------+-----+---------+\r\n  |Time.|Discharge|Time.|Discharge||Time.|Discharge|Time.|Discharge|\r\n  |     | of Bore |     | of Bore ||     | of Bore |     | of Bore |\r\n  |     | No. 6.  |     | No. 6.  ||     | No. 6.  |     | No. 6.  |\r\n  +-----+---------+-----+---------++-----+---------+-----+---------+\r\n  |P.M. | Gallons |A.M. | Gallons ||A.M. | Gallons |P.M. | Gallons |\r\n  |     |   per   |     |   per   ||     |   per   |     |   per   |\r\n  |     | Minute. |     | Minute. ||     | Minute. |     | Minute. |\r\n  |     |         |     |         ||     |         |     |         |\r\n  | 7.0 |  61·2   | 1.0 |  76·6   || 7.0 |  83·7   | 1.0 |  69·0   |\r\n  |     |         |     |         ||     |         |     |         |\r\n  | 8.15|  65·6   | 2.30|  77·4   || 8.0 |  78·4   | 2.0 |  67·7   |\r\n  |     |         |     |         ||     |         |     |         |\r\n  | 9.0 |  68·4   | 3.0 |  79·2   || 9.0 |  75·0   | 3.0 |  66·8   |\r\n  |     |         |     |         ||     |         |     |         |\r\n  |10.0 |  69·6   | 4.0 |  79·7   ||10.0 |  73·0   | 4.0 |  66·2   |\r\n  |     |         |     |         ||     |         |     |         |\r\n  |11.0 |  73·2   | 5.0 |  82·1   ||11.0 |  70·8   | 5.0 |  66·6   |\r\n  |     |         |     |         ||     |         |     |         |\r\n  |12.0 |  74·7   | 6.0 |  83·1   ||12.0 |  69·6   | 6.0 |  65·3   |\r\n  |     |         |     |         ||     |         |     |         |\r\n  |     |         |     |         ||     |         | 7.0 |  64·0   |\r\n  +-----+---------+-----+---------++-----+---------+-----+---------+\r\n\r\nFrom these figures it will be seen that the shutting down of a\r\nflowing or the opening of a closed well may produce a most marked\r\neffect on a neighbouring well within the short space of sixty\r\nminutes, even when the intervening distance is over 500 metres. In\r\nthe above instance the rate of increase was most rapid at first,\r\nthere being a gain of 7 gallons per minute, equivalent to about\r\n12 per cent., in the first two hours. The total increase in the\r\ntwelve hours amounted to 22½ gallons, or about 37 per cent. On\r\nreopening No. 5 it is seen that the discharge of No. 6 at once\r\ncommenced to fall, the loss being nearly 9 gallons in the first\r\ntwo hours; afterwards the rate of decrease gradually diminished,\r\nuntil at 7 p.m., when the observations were discontinued, the flow\r\nhad fallen to within 3 gallons of its normal.\r\n\r\nA second series of observations was made between two bores\r\nconsiderably farther apart, No. 4 being 835 metres N.N.W. of\r\nNo. 42. The difference of level in this case was found to be 1·18\r\nmetres, the outlet of No. 4 being 60·74, and that of No. 42,\r\n59·56 metres. Bore No. 4 has an internal diameter of 4¼ inches,\r\nis 141 metres deep, and draws from 19 metres of sandstone; Bore\r\nNo. 42 is 6 inches in diameter, 218 metres deep, and 69 metres into\r\nthe water-sandstone. Previous to the experiment, No. 4 was flowing\r\n36·75, and No. 42 about 68·5 gallons per minute. Precautions were\r\ntaken against other wells influencing the results, the nearest bores\r\nhaving been opened twenty-four hours previously and being kept in\r\nthe same condition throughout the experiment. Bore No. 42 was closed\r\ndown at 9 a.m. on March 4, 1908, periodical observations being then\r\nmade of the discharge of No. 4 during the next thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, the result of this experiment was as follows: The\r\ndischarge of No. 4 had not perceptibly increased at the end of the\r\nfirst half-hour, but had done so after one hour. It continued to\r\nincrease at a very slow rate, the net gain after thirty-six hours\r\nbeing only 3 gallons, or between 8 and 9 per cent. In this case\r\nthe mutual interference is very much less than that between Nos. 5\r\nand 6, doubtless largely owing to the greater distance apart,\r\nand to the lesser difference between the outlet-levels of the\r\nwells. In all probability there are many other conditions which\r\ncombine with the above in determining the amount of interference,\r\nsuch as the positions of the wells with regard to the main lines\r\nof underground flow, the relative depths of the bores, and the\r\nthicknesses of sandstone from which they draw their supplies.\r\n\r\nThe most marked example of interference with which I have met was\r\nin the case of two ancient wells at El Dêr el Ghennîma, situated\r\nonly 88 metres apart, on the crest of an anticlinal fold running\r\nnorth and south. These wells had been sanded-up for centuries,\r\nbut were recently taken in hand and cleaned out. The difference of\r\nlevel in the outlets is 2·07 metres, the higher well being 34½\r\nmetres in depth, the lower 41 metres. The opening or closing of the\r\nlower well produces an almost instantaneous effect on the higher,\r\nthe difference in flow of the latter within thirty seconds amounting\r\nto as much as 11 per cent.\r\n\r\nA great many observations were made, but the following are sufficient\r\nto show the rates of decrease and increase:\r\n\r\n                 Gallons per\r\n                   Minute.\r\n  Upper well flowed 13·2 when lower well was open (flow 50·3 g.p.m.).\r\n      „       „     20·5     „      „    had been closed 10 minutes.\r\n      „       „     23·7     „      „       „      „     20    „\r\n      „       „     26·3     „      „       „      „     30    „\r\n      „       „     39·4     „      „       „      „     24 hours.\r\n      „       „     35·6     „      „    had been open   30 seconds.\r\n      „       „     32·5     „      „       „      „      2 minutes.\r\n      „       „     26·7     „      „       „      „      7    „\r\n      „       „     24·9     „      „       „      „      9    „\r\n      „       „     23·4     „      „       „      „     16½   „\r\n      „       „     19·7     „      „       „      „     45    „\r\n\r\nThe closing down of the lower well is thus seen to have influenced\r\nthe discharge of the upper to the extent of 100 per cent, in\r\nthe short space of thirty minutes, while the flow was trebled in\r\ntwenty-four hours. On opening the lower well the discharge of the\r\nupper fell to within 50 per cent. of its normal within forty-five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, most bores show a marked decline in discharge\r\nfor some time after completion, and except in special cases it\r\nseems doubtful if large bores can be expected to maintain their\r\noriginal flows for long periods of years. During the early part of\r\nits existence a well draws its supplies from fully saturated beds,\r\nthe water being forced into it from every side, not only through the\r\npores of the sandstone, but through any fissures the bore may have\r\nstruck. The flow of water through a compact sandstone is, however,\r\nextremely slow, and it is probable that as time goes on every bore\r\nbecomes more and more dependent on fissures for the maintenance\r\nof its supply. This supersaturation of the water-bearing beds,\r\nif we may be permitted to use the term, is well illustrated by the\r\nclosing of a bore for a few days. The water at once commences to\r\naccumulate around it, and when the bore is reopened the discharge\r\nwill generally be found to have increased to a very great extent. As\r\nan example of this I may mention Bore No. 14, which, on April 19,\r\n1907, was flowing at the rate of 225 gallons per minute. The well\r\nwas then closed down for five days; on reopening the discharge was\r\nfound to be 370 gallons per minute, an increase of 145 gallons, or\r\nabout 65 per cent., the pressure during the same time having risen\r\nfrom below 9 to nearly 16 pounds per square inch. The discharge\r\ntook about twelve hours, or one-tenth of the time, to fall to its\r\nnormal. On another occasion the same well had its output increased\r\nfrom 217 to 339 gallons by being closed for twenty-four hours,\r\na gain amounting to 55 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe rate of flow of water through an underground sandstone depends\r\nupon a number of conditions, the most important being the size of\r\nthe pores or spaces between the component grains, the porosity\r\nor water-holding capacity of the sandstone, the temperature of\r\nthe water, and the pressure acting on it. The yield of a well\r\nwill depend, of course, not only on all these factors, but also\r\non the diameter of the bore, its depth into the water-stratum,\r\nthe size and number of fissures passed through, and, last and most\r\nimportant of all, on the absolute height of its outlet. Large pores,\r\nhigh average porosity, and high temperatures make for strong flows,\r\nthough in the absence of pressure greater than that due to a column\r\nof water equal in height to the distance between the water-stratum\r\nand the outlet of the well, they are in themselves of no avail in\r\nthe production of an artesian flow. Moreover, although some of the\r\nabove conditions may be known beforehand, the resistance to flow of\r\nthe strata immediately surrounding a bore can never be more than\r\napproximately conjectured, as the size and mode of arrangement of\r\nthe individual grains of any sedimentary rock must always vary,\r\nboth horizontally and vertically, to a very great extent, and on\r\nthese factors depends in very large measure the capacity of the\r\nstrata to transmit water.\r\n\r\nData are as yet far too insufficient to warrant an attempt to\r\ncalculate the supply which can safely be drawn from a given area\r\nwithout unduly reducing the pressure, lowering the average static\r\nhead, and endangering the continuance of the artesian supply. In\r\nsome parts of the oasis there are bores many hundreds of years\r\nold still pouring forth their hundreds of gallons a minute; such\r\nwells are probably situated in exceptionally favourable localities,\r\nand are very possibly fed to a great extent by fissures. At the\r\nsame time it must not be forgotten that there are throughout the\r\noasis scores of wells which have ceased to run, either through\r\nlocal exhaustion of the water-bearing strata, or through failure to\r\nkeep the bore-channels open; possibly through a combination of both\r\ncircumstances. In some cases time seems to have remedied matters,\r\nas it is not uncommon to meet with instances where new bores, sunk\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of long extinct wells, have produced\r\nstrong discharges of considerable volume.\r\n\r\nAs I have already stated, the rate of flow of water is largely\r\ninfluenced by both the size of the pores and the porosity of the\r\nrock, the capacity to transmit water being very much greater for\r\nlarge than for small pores, and for high than for low porosity. It\r\nmust, however, be pointed out that large pores and high porosity\r\ndo not necessarily go together, and that small pores in a rock\r\nfrequently accompany high holding capacity. For instance, a\r\nfine-grained sample of Nubian Sandstone will absorb from 25 to 28 per\r\ncent. of water, a medium-grained sample 20 per cent., while a very\r\ncoarse sample may take up as little as 15 per cent. The pores and\r\ntransmitting capacity of the coarse-grained variety will, however,\r\nbe very much greater than in the case of either of the others.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at some sort of idea as to the holding capacity\r\nof the artesian-water strata of the oasis I made an examination of\r\nbetween sixty and seventy samples of sand brought up from varying\r\ndepths from a few selected bores in the oasis. As, however, owing\r\nto the methods of drilling employed, only powdered samples were\r\navailable, it was necessary in the first instance to ascertain the\r\nrelative porosity of sandstone in its ordinary state and broken up\r\ninto the form of sand. For this purpose I collected eight specimens\r\nof the Surface-water Sandstone from various points in Northern\r\nKharga, and subjected them to absorption tests, both in the whole\r\nand in the powdered states. In six out of the eight examples the\r\nabsorption was more when powdered than when whole, the average for\r\nthe eight rock samples being 22·44 per cent.; for the same when\r\npowdered, 23·55 per cent. There is, moreover, no reason to suspect\r\nthat in ordinary lithological characters the Surface-water Sandstone\r\ndiffers in any important respect from the Artesian-water Sandstone,\r\nso that if we estimate the porosity of the latter from powdered\r\nsamples, we shall obtain a figure only about 5 per cent. too high.\r\n\r\nThe average porosity of sixty-four samples, collected from Bores\r\n14, 16, 18, 31, 39, and 44, at various depths in the water-bearing\r\nstrata, was found to be 19·45 per cent. If we confine our attention\r\nto a single bore, and examine a representative sample from every\r\nstratum of the water-bearing sandstone, and, in deducing the\r\nporosity, take into account the thickness of each individual\r\nbed, we shall obtain a still more reliable figure. This was\r\ndone in the case of Bore No. 18, which passed through 122 metres\r\nof water-bearing strata, thirty-one samples being collected and\r\nsubjected to examination. The absorptions obtained varied from 15·3\r\nto 25·5 per cent., the average porosity of the whole column being\r\ncalculated as 19·6 per cent. I believe this figure may be accepted\r\nwithout misgiving as a satisfactory working value for the porosity\r\nof powdered Nubian Sandstone, that of the solid rock being taken\r\nas 5 per cent. lower, or, say, 18·5 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Artesian-water Sandstone has been proved to reach a thickness\r\nof 122 metres, and probably its total thickness is considerably\r\nmore. Assuming, however, a vertical extent of only 122 metres,\r\nthe water-bearing beds under 1 square kilometre would, if fully\r\nsaturated, hold 4,965,000,000 gallons, which is the equivalent of\r\nthe water which would be discharged in ninety-four years by a well\r\nflowing at the rate of 100 gallons a minute. When we consider that\r\nthe area of the floor of the depression is some thousands of square\r\nkilometres, and that the water-sandstones, except in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the existing wells, are probably fully saturated, we\r\nrealize the vast amount of water which is stored under the depression\r\nalone, irrespective of the still greater quantities which underlie\r\nthe surrounding plateaux. The movement of the water through the\r\nsandstones, except along fissures and through particularly porous\r\nbeds, is, however, very slow, so that the amount of water which\r\ncan economically be made available at the surface is more or less\r\nlimited, self-flowing wells being only obtainable over that portion\r\nof the area lying below the general static head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                   THE ORIGIN OF THE ARTESIAN WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFlow of Water through Porous Rocks — Importance of Pressure,\r\nPorosity, and Temperature — Intermittent Flows — Abundance of\r\nExtinct Wells — Former Prosperity — Possibility of increasing\r\nPresent Total Discharge — Local Traditions regarding Origin of\r\nArtesian Waters — Possible Sources of Origin — Seepage from Nile\r\ninto Nubian Sandstone — Sandstones as Storage Reservoirs — The\r\nOasis Waters of Meteoric Origin — Fissures — Rate of Flow —\r\nStrongly-flowing Wells not necessarily dependent on Fissures —\r\nLocal Pressure from Variation in Level of Water-Table — Rise of\r\nWater due to Hydraulic Pressure — Points requiring Investigation\r\n— High-Level Springs: Ain Amûr; on Escarpment near Beris;\r\nat Nakhail.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rate of flow of water through porous rocks has been investigated\r\nby a number of engineers and geologists, among whom may be mentioned\r\nDarcy, Hazen, King, Slichter, Knibbs, and Baldwin-Wiseman. The\r\nsubject is an extremely complicated one, and its study requires a\r\ncombined knowledge of mathematics, physics, and geology. Various\r\nformulæ for determining the rate of flow under varying conditions\r\nhave been devised, but it will be sufficient for our present purpose\r\nto remark that the average velocity of water in sands does not appear\r\nto be more than 3 or 4 kilometres a year. The importance of porosity,\r\npressure, and temperature on the rate of flow can be illustrated by\r\nutilizing tubes containing equal columns of sand of different degrees\r\nof coarseness, and noting the volumes of water passed under different\r\nconditions of pressure and temperature. The coarse sands will be\r\nobserved to permit the passage of water at a far greater rate than\r\nthe finer varieties, while any sand can be made to markedly quicken\r\nits rate of discharge by increasing the head of water in the tube\r\nabove. Moreover, the rate of flow will be found to increase with\r\nthe temperature of the water. In the case of the ordinary water of\r\nthe oasis, a difference of only a few degrees was found to cause a\r\nvery great difference in the rate of flow; it seems, indeed, as if\r\nthe water, when below a certain temperature, deposits its mineral\r\ncontents in the pores of the sandstone, so as to block the passages\r\nto a large extent. I have not yet had an opportunity of making the\r\nnecessary experiments to ascertain if this explanation is correct,\r\nbut if it should prove to be so, the importance of temperature on\r\nthe rate of underground flow can hardly be over-estimated.\r\n\r\nWe have already described the intermittent character of the flow\r\nin the case of some of the larger wells in the southern part of the\r\noasis. The circumstance is apparently due to the temporary blocking\r\nof the bore-hole by sediment, and the consequent increase of water\r\nand gas pressure below, which at intervals forces the sediment from\r\nthe channels and restores the normal flow. Something of the same\r\nnature was also noticed in Bore No. 42, in the course of experiments\r\ncarried out to determine the height to which the water would rise\r\nin an open pipe fixed to the end of the casing. At intervals a\r\ndistinct gurgling and bubbling took place in the pipe, the water at\r\nthe same time rising to as much as 8 centimetres above its normal\r\nlevel, with distinct oscillations of a pressure-gauge attached to\r\nthe well. The ebb and flow did not, however, take place at regular\r\nintervals, but at periods varying from four to nine minutes. I think\r\na sufficient explanation of these phenomena is the probable variation\r\nin the amount of gas finding its way into the bore; and certainly,\r\nafter several years’ observation of the flows of a large number\r\nof bores, I cannot admit that there is the slightest evidence in\r\nfavour of the view that the flows of the wells have a periodicity\r\ndependent on the rise and fall of the Nile.\r\n\r\nOne frequently hears it stated that the oases were far more thickly\r\npopulated and better watered in olden times than at the present\r\nday. This belief is based on the existence in many parts of the\r\ndepression of extensive remains of temples, forts, and villages,\r\non the widespread traces of formerly cultivated lands, and on the\r\nabundance of sanded-up wells. It must not, however, be forgotten\r\nthat the remains in question belong to successive generations,\r\nand that there is as yet no evidence to enable us to determine how\r\nmuch of the land, or how many of the wells, were in use at one and\r\nthe same time. The evidence is, however, sufficiently pronounced to\r\njustify the conclusion that under the Romans the oasis of Kharga\r\nwas far more flourishing than in modern times, a large part of\r\nthe population being engaged, not in agriculture, but in mining,\r\nboring, and in the excavation of subterranean aqueducts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDS UNDER RECLAMATION AT BORE NO. 39.]\r\n\r\nWe have heard the most diverse and dogmatic opinions as to\r\nthe feasibility of restoring the oases to their supposed former\r\nprosperity. For my part, I do not think that there is the slightest\r\ndoubt that the total discharge of water could be very much increased,\r\nthough to what extent it is impossible to say with the information at\r\npresent available. One must consider the vast areas under which the\r\nwater-bearing sandstones are known to extend, and the comparatively\r\nsmall extent of country over which the existing wells occur; that\r\nas yet the deepest bores have only penetrated the water-bearing\r\nbeds to a depth of 122 metres; that the existing total discharge\r\nis mostly made up of insignificant flows from a great number of\r\nancient and comparatively shallow wells, which for centuries have\r\nbeen subject to gradual decay; that so far as observed the flows\r\nincrease in volume as deeper beds are struck; and that it might be\r\npossible to use artificial means of lifting the water to the surface,\r\nespecially in districts lying above the level to which the artesian\r\nwater will rise unaided. The extent to which the water-supply could\r\nbe profitably augmented is, however, quite another question, and\r\none depending on a great number of at present indeterminable factors.\r\n\r\nAccording to local tradition, the waters of the Kharga wells\r\ncome directly from the Nile through subterranean passages under\r\nthe intervening plateaux, and the experience of an Arab trader is\r\nfrequently related in support of this idea. The Bedawi in question,\r\nwhile engaged in filling his water-skins on the banks of the Nile,\r\npreparatory to setting out across the desert to the oasis, let\r\nfall his ‘tarbush,’ which was speedily engulfed in an eddy\r\nof the river. Although much annoyed at the time, our friend soon\r\nforgot the incident, until a few days later, when he was refreshing\r\nhimself after his journey at a well in the neighbourhood of Beris,\r\nthe identical piece of head-gear was borne up from its depths!\r\n\r\nMr. Patterson, whose knowledge of the folklore of the inhabitants is\r\nunique, recently related to me the following characteristic story:\r\nThe natives of Beris, as the result of opening a long sanded-up\r\nwell, obtained a very large flow of water. So terrified were they at\r\nthe magnitude of the discharge—imagining, indeed, that they had\r\ntapped the Nile—that a deputation was hastily despatched to the\r\nGovernor of Assiut, with profuse apologies for the damage done to\r\nthe river. Needless to say, the Governor was somewhat taken aback,\r\nbut realizing the solemnity of the mission, magnanimously informed\r\nits members that the waters of the Nile were so abundant that they\r\nmight without fear take all they required.\r\n\r\nAt present any attempt to explain the origin of the artesian waters\r\nof the oases must be regarded as little better than speculation. More\r\ninformation is required concerning the geology of the country\r\nto the south of the oases, and as to the relative levels of the\r\noases-depressions and the different parts of the Nile Valley and\r\nLibyan Desert, as far south as the more elevated regions of Kordofan,\r\nDarfur, and Tibesti. Little has been written on this subject, but\r\nthe source generally assigned appears to have been Darfur. Possible\r\nsources of origin lie in the rainy districts of the Sudan, in the\r\nmountainous region of Abyssinia, in the great swamps of the Upper\r\nNile, in the Nile River itself, and in past accumulations of water\r\nabsorbed from the extensive lakes which covered parts of the country\r\nin the pluvial period which preceded the existing desert conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge I am personally inclined to\r\nagree with those who regard the Nile River as a present source of\r\nsupply. It is known to flow for a considerable part of its course\r\nthrough a valley cut out in the Nubian Sandstone, and it is believed\r\nto lose an appreciable volume of water into that sandstone, though\r\nthe exact amount has not been determined. Mr. J. I. Craig, of the\r\nEgyptian Survey, has estimated that at low Nile as much as 6,000\r\ncubic metres of water (1,320,000 gallons) per minute drains back\r\ninto the river from the sandstones on either side of the reach\r\nbetween Khartum and Wadi Halfa, and, as Captain Lyons remarks,\r\nthis indicates that there is considerable percolation into the\r\nsandstones from the river when in flood.[10]\r\n\r\nThere is one point of the greatest importance to which we should\r\nlike to draw attention, as it is generally entirely overlooked. The\r\nstores of water in the sandstones may represent the accumulations\r\nof hundreds and thousands of years, and the conditions to which the\r\nbeds formerly owed their sources of supply may at the present time\r\nhave become materially altered. It is quite conceivable that it\r\nmay have required centuries or thousands of years to saturate the\r\nhuge block of sandstone underlying the Libyan Desert, and even were\r\nthe original sources of supply entirely cut off at any particular\r\ntime, the effect on a few hundred bores, discharging only 50,000\r\ncubic metres a day, would not necessarily be appreciable in one,\r\nor even five, centuries.\r\n\r\nThe total annual discharge of the whole of the wells of Kharga Oasis\r\nis barely equal in volume to the water which can be held by saturated\r\nbeds underlying 1 square kilometre of surface, assuming the sandstone\r\nto be only 122 metres thick; that is to say, it would take between\r\n3,000 and 4,000 years for the existing wells to discharge the water\r\nheld by the beds underlying the depression alone, without considering\r\nthe vast surrounding desert areas, where there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that the water-tables are equally well developed. It must\r\nnot, however, for a moment be supposed that bores would continue\r\nto discharge until the sandstones immediately surrounding them\r\nwere completely depleted of water; they would, in all probability,\r\npass into a sub-artesian condition in a very short time were the\r\nsandstones not replenished from more outlying districts.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the subterranean water of the oasis is certainly of\r\nmeteoric origin—that is to say, it is water which originally\r\nfell as rain, and has percolated underground from one of the\r\npossible sources above mentioned. It will, however, readily be\r\nadmitted that the ordinary explanation of the flow and origin\r\nof artesian wells in regions of moderate or abundant rainfall,\r\nsituated in well-defined basins, where the exact position, extent,\r\nand absorbing capacity of the water-table outcrop can be carefully\r\ndetermined, may be in some respects inadequate to account for the\r\nflowing wells of vast arid regions like the deserts of Africa and\r\nAustralia; yet, after due consideration of the arguments for and\r\nagainst, I am unable to subscribe to Professor J. W. Gregory’s\r\nview[11] that a considerable portion of the waters in such regions\r\nis derived from magmatic or plutonic sources—that is to say,\r\nhas its origin in the deep-seated crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nIt may seem at first sight almost incredible that in those regions,\r\nwhere the outcrop of the water-bearing strata is so remote from the\r\nwells themselves and the dip over the intervening country so slight,\r\nthe rise of the water in the wells could be due to direct pressure of\r\nwater in the higher portions of the beds, unless on the supposition\r\nof large and continuous open fissures. That such fissures exist,\r\nand exist abundantly, is, I think, almost a matter of certainty;\r\nbut it does not follow that their presence is essential to the\r\nproduction of flowing wells. Fissures are visible to the eye in\r\nthe Surface-water Sandstone (which, as has been remarked, does not\r\nappear to differ in any important respect from the Artesian-water\r\nSandstone), and it is through them that the bulk of the sub-surface\r\nwater is obtained. The presence of fissures in the Artesian-water\r\nSandstone is, moreover, in my opinion, almost demonstrated by the\r\nexperiments on the mutual interference of wells. It seems hardly\r\nconceivable that the closing or opening of a bore could in the\r\nspace of a minute or two affect the discharge of another well over\r\n½ kilometre distant, if there did not exist a more or less open\r\nand direct connection between the two.\r\n\r\nRapid flow through a compact sandstone is impossible owing to\r\nfriction, which increases as the size of the channels decreases;\r\nbut, as pointed out by Knibbs and others, the hydrostatic pressure\r\ncan never entirely disappear through friction, the rate of loss of\r\nhead being dependent on the rate of flow. It therefore by no means\r\nfollows that a strongly-flowing well cannot be obtained from an\r\nunfissured sandstone, for a rapid flow from the bore itself does\r\nnot in any way depend on an equally rapid flow of the water through\r\nthe sandstone surrounding the bore. For instance, Mr. Knibbs has\r\ncalculated[12] that although in a 10-inch bore, discharging 700\r\ngallons a minute from a 10-foot stratum, the water would have a\r\nvelocity of 5½ feet a second at the bore itself, at the distance\r\nof one mile it would only be moving through the stratum at the rate\r\nof about ¹⁄₂₀₀ inch per second, or 18 inches an hour. In\r\nother words, water flowing through a 10-foot bed of sandstone from\r\nall sides towards a 10-inch bore, need, at the distance of one mile,\r\nonly have a velocity of 18 inches an hour to produce a discharge\r\nfrom the well of 700 gallons a minute.\r\n\r\nThe importance of local pressure arising from variations in level\r\nof a fully saturated water-table in adjacent areas may be of itself\r\nquite adequate to cause flowing wells, especially if assisted by the\r\npresence of large volumes of gas under compression, such as occur in\r\nthe Kharga waters. Another theory which has at times been brought\r\nforward as an adequate cause of flowing wells is rock-pressure—\r\n_i.e._, pressure due to the weight of the overlying strata. The\r\nobjections to this theory seem to me, however, so cogent that\r\nwe may at once dismiss it from our minds. There is indeed little\r\ndoubt that the waters of the oasis are of meteoric origin, have\r\ntravelled immense distances underground, and rise through bores\r\nplaced in favourable localities by means of hydrostatic or hydraulic\r\npressure, acting both through the pores of the rock and through\r\nopen fissures. Although the rate and direction of flow through the\r\nsandstones as a whole may remain more or less matters of conjecture,\r\nit seems probable that the water of any one bore is derived from\r\nall sides, rising as the result of the pressure exerted by the\r\nwater held in the same bed situated at higher levels, whether in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood or at a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nI am conscious of having done little more than indicate the possible\r\norigin of the oasis waters and suggest the causes to which the\r\nflowing wells are due; more than this it is at present impossible\r\nto state with any confidence. The points to which attention should\r\nbe directed as likely to throw further light on the subject are as\r\nfollows: The area and position of the outcrops of the Impermeable\r\nGrey Shales and the underlying sandstone, and their relations to\r\npossible sources of water, whether rain, river, or lake; the nature\r\nof the bed of the swamp region of the Upper Nile; the amount and\r\ndistribution of the rainfall of all surrounding regions; the volume\r\nof water lost in the different reaches of the Nile over and above\r\nthat which can be directly accounted for by evaporation and by water\r\nabstracted for purposes of irrigation; and the total thickness of the\r\nwater-bearing beds, the presence within them of impervious strata,\r\nand their relation to the underlying crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AIN AMUR, ON THE UPPER DAKHLA ROAD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HIGH-LEVEL SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of water-supply we must briefly refer\r\nto two or three remarkable instances where water is found at very\r\nhigh elevations. The most important of these is on the upper road\r\nbetween Kharga and Dakhla, where a spring, known as Ain Amûr,\r\noccurs near the summit of the plateau at about 460 metres above\r\nsea-level. The water, which is quite potable, occupies the bottom\r\nof a hole about 3 or 4 metres in depth, at the base of a clump of\r\npalm-stubs, a few paces to the south of a solitary tree; it does\r\nnot run, and the water-level is said to fall considerably in the\r\nsummer. A small patch of green rushes lies a few paces to the west,\r\nand there is a good deal of scrub in the neighbourhood, from the\r\nposition of which one is led to infer that there are several small\r\nsprings thrown out along one of the bedding-planes, at the summit\r\nof the marly and clayey beds which underlie the limestones forming\r\nthe uppermost portion of the cliff.\r\n\r\nThe high-level spring on the eastern wall of the oasis, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Beris, consists of a pool of clear sweet water at\r\nthe base of a large fallen block of limestone, in a desolate rocky\r\ndingle. Ball determined its height as being 180 metres above Beris,\r\nor 260 metres above sea-level. The pool itself is overgrown with\r\nweeds, and, scattered about on the sides and bottom of the valley,\r\nthere is a good deal of vegetation, mostly in the form of coarse\r\ngrasses, prickly scrub, and tamarisk bushes. Geologically, the spring\r\nappears to be similarly situated to Ain Amûr—that is to say, it\r\nemerges near, or at the summit of, the argillaceous Exogyra Series,\r\nand below the overlying Danian limestones.\r\n\r\nThe water obtainable at Nakhail, 60 kilometres S.S.E. of the oasis,\r\nalso appears near the summit of the Exogyra Series, and may therefore\r\nbe considered to have a similar origin to the springs just described.\r\n\r\nThese elevated occurrences, thrown out along more or less definite\r\ngeological horizons, must be regarded as natural springs, quite\r\ndistinct from the artificially-made wells of the oasis-floor. As\r\nthe springs lie several hundred feet above the static head of the\r\nartesian water, and are separated from the water-bearing sandstones\r\nby a great thickness of argillaceous impermeable strata, it is\r\nperhaps permissible to assume that their waters are derived from\r\nan entirely different source. The occurrences known are of very\r\nlimited number, and the water only appears in small quantities, so\r\nthat it is not unlikely that it is derived from the very occasional\r\nrains which fall on the plateaux. A portion of these rains would\r\ndoubtless find its way downwards through fissures in the limestone,\r\nand, in areas where the dip of the beds was towards the oasis,\r\nmight travel underground and occasionally be thrown out as springs\r\non the walls of the depression, at the junction of the limestones\r\nand underlying clays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                  THE ANCIENT SUBTERRANEAN AQUEDUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks of Public Utility — The System probably introduced from\r\nPersia — The Bulk of the Works carried out by the Romans —\r\nTrenches connecting Wells with Cultivable Lands — Fortress\r\nBores and their Underground Connections — Dêr el Ghennîma\r\n— Subterranean Aqueducts of Qasr Gyb — Qasr Lebekha and Um el\r\nDabâdib — Reopening of Tunnel by Sheikh Hassan Hanadi — Sala\r\nAbdulla — Nature of Tunnels and Shafts — The Magnitude of the\r\nUnderground Works — Exploration of the Tunnels — Origin of\r\nthe Water.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Persians and Romans left abundant traces of their\r\noccupation of the country in the shape of temples, forts, and\r\nmonasteries, the determination and energy with which they prosecuted\r\nthe colonization and general development of the oases is best\r\nshown by their attention to works of public utility. At no period\r\nin the history of the oases has so much attention been paid to the\r\nwater-supply. Not content with tapping the deep-seated sources by\r\nmeans of bores, they carried out underground works of considerable\r\nmagnitude and involving engineering difficulties of no mean order,\r\nso as to obtain additional supplies from the sandstones lying at\r\nor near the surface. The methods employed were probably introduced\r\nfrom Persia, where underground aqueducts, or ‘kareez,’ for the\r\ntransference of water from one locality to another, have from an\r\nearly date been employed. At the same time, judging by the character\r\nof the ancient buildings in the immediate neighbourhood of the most\r\nimportant of these works, it seems probable that the latter were\r\nfor the most part constructed by the Romans.\r\n\r\nUnderground aqueducts are found to some extent in all the chief\r\noases of the Libyan Desert, but in Northern Kharga they far exceed\r\nin magnitude anything known elsewhere. In their simplest form they\r\nconsist of deep trenches connecting the wells with low-lying areas\r\nof cultivable land, the object being to tap the bores at the lowest\r\npossible levels, in order to obtain the greatest discharges. Thus,\r\nalthough a bore, originally sunk on comparatively high ground for\r\nthe purpose of irrigating a particular area of land, might through\r\none cause or another have ceased to flow, it could still be made\r\navailable for any low-lying area farther afield by the simple\r\nexpedient of tapping it below the surface by means of a trench or\r\ntunnel. This practice was frequently resorted to.\r\n\r\nIn selecting sites for their forts, monasteries, and other\r\nbuildings, the Romans were naturally drawn to eminences commanding\r\nviews of the surrounding country. It was, of course, desirable,\r\nand in the case of forts absolutely necessary, to have a supply\r\nof water within the building, and it was the custom, therefore,\r\nto sink a deep bore within the precincts, generally in the centre\r\nof the courtyard. In many cases, however, owing to the elevation,\r\nthe water would not rise to the surface, the supplies being drawn\r\nup by hand. In order to make the water of such a well available for\r\nirrigating the lands situated outside the fort, one or more gently\r\ninclined tunnels were excavated so as to tap the bore below the\r\nfort; the well was thus made to serve a double purpose. Excellent\r\nexamples of such conduits are to be seen at Dêr el Ghennîma. Here\r\nthe well is in the middle of the courtyard, and three underground\r\ntunnels converge on it from the low-lying and anciently cultivated\r\nlands to the north and north-west. Along those portions where the\r\nbottom of the channel was in soft ground, and not more than a metre\r\nor two below the surface, the conduit was made in the form of an\r\nopen trench, the sides being carefully built in with stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QASR LEBEKHA AND THE NORTHERN ESCARPMENT OF THE\r\nOASIS.]\r\n\r\nWhen the excavation of the trenches was completed, the open portions\r\nwere covered over with large flat slabs of rock, so that the channels\r\nwere not only well protected from blowing sand, but quite invisible\r\non the surface. The underground conduits at Dêr el Ghennîma were\r\nindeed quite unsuspected before they were accidentally discovered\r\na year or two ago. The tapping of the bore within the fort had,\r\nof course, the effect of still further lowering the water-level\r\nas regards the courtyard; it is quite likely, therefore, that\r\nthe inhabitants had a means of blocking the underground channel\r\nwhen they desired the water to rise to its maximum level in the\r\nwell. But in any case the few extra metres of distance from the\r\nsurface to the water could not have been a matter of importance,\r\nas the comparatively small supplies needed for domestic purposes\r\nwithin the fort were doubtless raised by means of a bucket and rope\r\nattached to a windlass.\r\n\r\nThese short tunnels, tapping the water of artesian wells bored on\r\nhigh ground, are quite insignificant compared with the extensive\r\nsystems of subterranean aqueducts driven into the solid rock in\r\nvarious localities in the north of the oasis. The most remarkable\r\nof these are found at Um el Dabâdib, at Qasr Lebekha, and in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Qasr Gyb. They were made with the object\r\nof obtaining auxiliary supplies of water from the Surface-water\r\nSandstone, and were especially applicable to localities where this\r\nsandstone has an extensive development and forms hills or plateaux\r\nabove the general level of the floor of the oasis. Although it\r\nis difficult to believe that the supplies of water obtained were\r\ncommensurate with the time and labour involved in the construction of\r\nthe collecting tunnels, we may safely assume that the engineers who\r\nso carefully planned and carried out the works had fully considered\r\nthe results to be looked for. The ruins of villages and the traces\r\nof formerly cultivated tracts show that sufficient water was obtained\r\nto enable fairly large colonies to exist, though after the withdrawal\r\nof the Romans these outlying districts were abandoned, the aqueducts\r\nsilted up, and the cultivated lands reverted to the desert.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Um el Dabâdib are situated under the northern wall\r\nof the depression, and distant about 36 kilometres N.N.W. of Kharga\r\nvillage, the route usually followed lying between the hill-massifs\r\nof Jebel Têr and Jebel Tarif. A better route is afforded by the\r\ncaravan road running from Meheriq to Ain Amûr, Um el Dabâdib lying\r\nsomewhat to the north of the track at a distance of 25 kilometres\r\nfrom the village.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Ball, in the course of his survey of the oasis, visited Um el\r\nDabâdib in 1898, and thought it possible that one of the tunnels,\r\nwhich he observed ran northwards from the neighbourhood of the ruins,\r\nhad originally formed a means of communication with some unknown and\r\nformerly inhabited depression to the north of the escarpment. Its\r\nreal nature was, however, well known to the Kharga people, and a\r\nyear or two later Sheikh Hassan Hanadi, a brother of the present\r\nOmda of Kharga village, got together a number of men and cleaned\r\nout one of the tunnels from top to bottom, with the result that,\r\nafter a lapse of perhaps 1,000 years, water again flowed from the\r\nmouth of the aqueduct, and enabled a small agricultural colony to\r\nestablish itself on the ruined site of the original founders.\r\n\r\nSheikh Hassan informed me that the bulk of the work had been done\r\nunder his personal supervision, by a gang of from seventy to eighty\r\nmen employed throughout the hot season; he had found from experience\r\nthat the natives worked better in summer than in winter. The main\r\ntunnel was entirely cleared of clay and sand, the silted material\r\nbeing lifted out through the numerous man-holes or vertical shafts\r\nwhich connect the aqueduct with the surface above. A great deal of\r\nrough masonry work had also to be undertaken where the sandstone roof\r\nor walls had fallen in. The place was put in thoroughly good order,\r\nand all the shafts again closed, with the exception of two or three\r\nleft open to permit of the descent of the men sent down periodically\r\nto examine the channel and keep it free from silted material.\r\n\r\nWhen I first visited the place in January, 1905, I found the\r\ndischarge from the mouth of the aqueduct was between 30 and 35\r\ngallons per minute. A dozen acres or so of land had been reclaimed,\r\nand were tended by seven or eight men, who informed me that the crops\r\nraised there were equal to those in any part of the oasis. This I\r\ncan quite believe, as, in spite of the fact that several dune-belts\r\nexist in the neighbourhood, the place is comparatively sheltered\r\nfrom the northerly winds by the great escarpment to the north.\r\n\r\nThe little settlement of Um el Dabâdib, with its adjoining fertile\r\nfields and fruit-garden, threaded by the life-giving stream emerging\r\nfrom the foot-hills of the stupendous cliffs to the north, and\r\nbacked by the grim fort of bygone ages to the south, has in the\r\nmidst of this desert an indescribable charm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS AT UM EL DABADIB.]\r\n\r\nSala Abdulla, old Sheikh Hassan’s head-man here, proved to be a\r\nmost delightful fellow, and far superior to the average native in\r\ngeneral intelligence. He spun the most fantastic yarns about the\r\ndesert tableland to the north, and—a peculiarity I appreciated\r\nmost of all—without expecting me to believe him. According to\r\nSala, traces exist of a formerly much-frequented road, said to lead\r\nto a place called Ain Hamûr, lying somewhere to the north-west of\r\nAin Amûr. But although he himself had on one occasion set out and\r\ntravelled for many hours beyond the summit of the cliffs, he had\r\nbeen forced to return without finding the place, the exact position\r\nof which is at the present day unknown. This out-of-the-way corner\r\nof the desert is, according to my informant, so undisturbed by man\r\nthat the gazelle there live for untold periods, and only eventually\r\nsuccumb to old age and the increasing weight of their horns, which\r\ngrow to such a size that the poor beasts are unable to move about\r\nin search of food!\r\n\r\nOn my expressing a desire to examine the underground aqueduct,\r\nSala led the way to one of the man-holes situated a couple of\r\nkilometres to the north, near the upper end of the tunnel. Producing\r\na palm-fibre rope from under a ledge in a cliff hard by, he attached\r\nit to a log placed across the mouth of the shaft. There was a hot,\r\nsteamy current of air ascending from the man-hole, the interior of\r\nwhich was as black as night. Sala had, however, provided candles\r\nand matches, and when he reached the bottom and shook the rope\r\nas a signal to me to follow, I could see a tiny speck of light in\r\nwhat seemed to be the bowels of the earth. Fortunately I had had a\r\ngood training in the Cornish and Welsh mines at home, so that the\r\nprospect of a descent by the rope did not worry me in the least, and\r\nafter scrambling into the shaft I went carefully down hand over hand.\r\n\r\nThe shaft, rectangular in cross-section, and beautifully cut through\r\nthe solid sandstone rock, measured roughly 1½ metres by ¾ of a\r\nmetre, tapering gradually downwards. The first few metres, sunk\r\nthrough the down-wash forming the bed of a valley, were carefully\r\nbuilt in with blocks of limestone, the bottom layer resting on the\r\nsolid rock below. Rough footholds on opposite sides of the shaft\r\nfacilitate the descent, and when nearing the bottom, as the rope\r\nstretched and contracted like elastic in a most unpleasant manner,\r\nI was glad to avail myself of their assistance. The shaft, which I\r\nafterwards found to have a depth of 40·3 metres (132 feet), goes\r\ndown perpendicularly, and when the bottom was reached, I found myself\r\nstanding in a gently flowing stream of water, which I knew continued\r\nits underground course for at least 2 kilometres to the south.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel itself is distinctly coffin-shaped in cross-section,\r\nbeing widest near the roof, and tapering downwards. Its average\r\nheight is about 1½ metres, the mean width near the top being\r\nabout 60 centimetres—_i.e._, it measures roughly 5 feet by 2\r\nfeet. In some places it is even narrower, so that a man of average\r\nstature not only has to keep his head very much bent, but is also\r\nforced to progress sideways if he wishes to make his way along\r\nthe channel. The place was so sultry, and the cramped position I\r\nhad to assume so tiring, that I had soon had enough, and groped my\r\nway back to the base of the shaft. As I had anticipated, the ascent\r\nproved considerably more difficult than the descent, and I was not\r\nsorry when I regained the surface. After the heat of the shaft and\r\nthe exertion of climbing, the outside air, despite the fact that\r\nit was an exceptionally hot day, felt bitterly cold, and the rapid\r\nevaporation from our perspiring bodies chilled us to the marrow.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had vowed at the time that nothing would induce me to\r\nagain enter the place, I afterwards reflected that, not having\r\nfollowed the tunnel to its extreme limits, there might still be\r\nfurther information to be gained, and at the termination there\r\nmight exist an inscription, the deciphering of which would yield\r\nthe much-desired information as to when and by whom the work had\r\nbeen carried out. Moreover, I particularly wished to ascertain\r\nwhether the bulk of the water came from one particular point or\r\nwhether it represented the accumulated flow from the numerous small\r\nfissures which a tunnel of such length must necessarily traverse. I\r\ntherefore took the first opportunity of revisiting the place, this\r\ntime providing myself with proper gear to facilitate the descent,\r\nand with instruments to make a thorough survey of the whole network\r\nof underground waterways.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch-map, reduced from the detailed plan made\r\nduring my last visit, shows that there are four main aqueducts,\r\nrunning nearly parallel, in a north and south direction, along the\r\nsides of three separate valleys. It is, of course, quite evident\r\nthat the tunnels were run under the valleys rather than beneath the\r\nintervening ridges with the express object of keeping as near the\r\nsurface as possible, so as to avoid unnecessary excavation in the\r\nsinking of the vertical shafts, and to reduce the labour involved in\r\nhoisting the excavated material to the surface. The engineers were\r\nat the same time careful to avoid the actual beds of the valleys,\r\nas there the soft nature of the ground would have necessitated a\r\nconsiderable amount of stone pitching, without which there would have\r\nbeen constant falls of the loose detritus, consisting of sand and\r\npebbles with large blocks of limestone, forming the actual floors\r\nof the valleys. Alignments were chosen along the extreme margins,\r\nthe mouths of the man-holes being commenced on the sloping sides of\r\nthe valleys, a metre or two above their pebbly floors. The great\r\nmajority were thus excavated throughout in solid rock, the latter\r\nbeing, as a rule, sufficiently firm to stand without timbering or\r\nmasonry supports.\r\n\r\nAlthough only one of the four main aqueducts is open at the present\r\ntime, the exact course which each follows can be seen from the\r\ndump-heaps marking the positions of the shafts. The longest of the\r\ntunnels is the most westerly, measuring 4·6 kilometres from the\r\npoint of origin to its exit on the west side of the ruined fort,\r\nthe four together having a total length of 14·3 kilometres. The\r\nactual length of horizontal excavation is, however, considerably\r\nin excess of this figure, as there are very numerous subsidiary\r\ncollecting branches ramifying from the main tunnels. Moreover,\r\nthe total length given is the figure obtained by measuring along\r\nthe surface from shaft to shaft; whereas, one of the most striking\r\nthings underground is the markedly irregular trend of the tunnel,\r\nwhich frequently takes a wide bend between two adjacent shafts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUBTERRANEAN AQUEDUCTS\r\nOF\r\nUM EL DABADIB]\r\n\r\nThe man-holes, or vertical shafts connecting the underground waterway\r\nwith the surface, served a double purpose. Through them the excavated\r\nmaterial was hoisted to the surface, and in addition they afforded\r\na means of ventilation, without which it is doubtful whether the\r\nwork could have been carried out. The excavation of the man-holes\r\nalone must have been a gigantic task, equal to, if not greater than,\r\nthat of cutting out the horizontal tunnels. The cross-section of\r\nan average-sized shaft is, if anything, greater than that of the\r\ntunnel; and although in vertical dimension the man-holes near\r\nthe mouth of the aqueduct are insignificant, the depth rapidly\r\nincreases in the opposite direction, owing to the upward slope of\r\nthe ground-surface towards the escarpment. As already mentioned,\r\nthe particular shaft I descended had a depth of over 40 metres,\r\nand subsequent levelling, from the exit of the aqueduct to a point\r\nabove its origin, showed the most northerly one to have a depth of\r\nnot less than 53½ metres (175 feet). Along this tunnel, which has\r\na total length of 2·9 kilometres, I counted exactly 150 shafts,\r\nso that their average distance apart is between 19 and 20 metres.\r\n\r\nThat the tunnel was most carefully planned and excavated is evident\r\nfrom its very low and gradual slope, as is indicated by the depth\r\nof water flowing through and by the generally unrippled character\r\nof the stream. Judging by the height of the mouth of one of the\r\nman-holes near the point of origin of the tunnel, and by its depth\r\nto the stream in the tunnel below, there only appears to be a fall\r\nof 1 metre in about 2½ kilometres, or a slope of 1 in 2,670. It is\r\npossible that, owing to the elasticity of the line used, there may\r\nbe a slight error in the measurement of the shaft, but the above\r\nfigure may be taken as approximately correct.\r\n\r\nWe have now enough data to calculate the amount of material excavated\r\nfrom these underground works, and this gives us a good idea of the\r\nmagnitude of the task. The average depth of the man-holes (from the\r\nground-surface to the roof of the horizontal tunnel) works out at 22\r\nmetres— that is to say, they represent a total length of vertical\r\nexcavation amounting to 3·3 kilometres. Adding 10 per cent. to\r\nthe length of the aqueduct, to allow for the numerous bends and\r\nthe side branches, we get 3·2 kilometres of horizontal excavation,\r\nor a grand total of 6·5 kilometres. From a number of measurements\r\nthe cross-section of both shafts and tunnels works out at an almost\r\nidentical figure—_i.e._, three-quarters of a square metre. Thus\r\nthe amount of rock excavated in this system alone is about 4,875\r\ncubic metres, and we may safely say that the construction of the\r\nfour subterranean aqueducts and the 600 or 700 vertical shafts meant\r\nthe excavation and removal of over 20,000 cubic metres of solid rock.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the time and labour involved in the excavation and\r\nremoval of this great mass of material, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat the latter represents the construction of underground passages\r\nover twenty miles in length, and of such restricted size that only\r\none man could have found room to work on the face of the tunnel or\r\nshaft at a time. And although the sinking of more than one vertical\r\nshaft may have been carried on simultaneously, the cutting of the\r\nlong aqueducts had almost certainly to be conducted from one side\r\nonly—_i.e._, from their exits. The accumulation of water would\r\nprobably have prevented the cutting out of different sections at\r\none and the same time by separate gangs of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, in the summer of 1908, I was foolhardy enough to follow\r\nthe aqueduct to its termination, from the bottom of the ninth\r\nshaft—the one I had previously descended—and in case some\r\nfuture visitor to Um el Dabâdib should feel inclined to examine\r\nfor himself these wonderful subterranean works, it may not be out\r\nof place to give a brief account of my examination of the upper\r\nportion and termination of the aqueduct in question (the second,\r\ncounting from the most westerly), so that he may benefit by my\r\nexperience. My particular objects were to ascertain if the bulk\r\nof the water came from one or more large fissures, to determine\r\nwhether any special characteristics marked the termination of the\r\ntunnel, and to discover whether there were inscriptions which would\r\nyield valuable information regarding the making of the aqueduct. My\r\nintention was to descend one of the uppermost shafts by means of\r\nthe windlass with which, remembering my previous experience with\r\nnothing better than a very elastic native-made rope, I had been\r\ncareful to provide myself. I reckoned that the distance thence to\r\nthe point of origin of the aqueduct could not be so far as to entail\r\nany great difficulty or danger from insufficiency of ventilation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately descent by any of these shafts proved out of the\r\nquestion in the time available, owing to their mouths having been\r\ncarefully closed by great slabs of rock, which I had no facilities\r\nfor moving. This discovery upset my calculations in two ways:\r\nunless I abandoned the undertaking altogether, which I was extremely\r\nloath to do after coming so far, it would be necessary to follow\r\nthe tunnel from the bottom of the ninth man-hole for at least 230\r\nmetres, and I had already experienced the difficulty of progressing\r\neven a short distance in so confined a space. Secondly, there was\r\nthe question of ventilation. With an open shaft near the top there\r\nwould at least have been good circulation through the greater part\r\nof the aqueduct; however, I still hoped that the upper man-holes were\r\nnot so tightly closed as to render the air below entirely stagnant.\r\n\r\nOne of the natives who had taken part in the cleaning out of the\r\naqueduct many years before asserted that the air was not altogether\r\nbad, and though I could not definitely ascertain whether or no he\r\nhad been to the end of the tunnel since the closing of so many\r\nof the ventilating shafts, I determined to accept his word for\r\nit, and we descended safely to the bottom. The water felt cool by\r\ncomparison with the air of the tunnel, though my thermometer showed\r\nthe temperature of both air and water to be identical, registering\r\n87° F. in both cases. It was quite sweet, though a good deal of\r\nsediment appeared when the stream was stirred up.\r\n\r\nAfter making a number of measurements of the shaft and tunnel,\r\nwe proceeded on our way upstream. The sides of the tunnel\r\nwere everywhere beautifully cut in a light brown sandstone, the\r\ndirection of the pick-marks showing that it had been excavated in\r\nthe same direction as that we were following—_i.e._, from south\r\nto north. Small notches for the lights used by the workmen were\r\nplainly observable on the walls, about half-way between the floor\r\nand the roof. As a rule the tunnel maintains an elongated oval form,\r\nwider near the top than elsewhere; along one length, however, where\r\nit evidently follows a fissure, both top and bottom taper sharply,\r\nso much so that our feet constantly got jammed in the narrow,\r\nwedge-shaped channel through which the water flows. We passed many\r\nside branches, blind alleys, in fact, and the main tunnel itself\r\nzigzagged considerably, frequently turning at sharp angles, and\r\nmore than once almost doubling back on itself.\r\n\r\nThe air was bad enough at the start, but seemed to get worse as we\r\nproceeded. I trusted, however, to finding a distinct improvement in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the shafts, but to my dismay each one in turn\r\nproved to be hermetically sealed with masses of rock just above its\r\njunction with the tunnel, and there was not the slightest suspicion\r\nof any circulation of air, so that the only relief they afforded\r\nwas the possibility of resting in an upright position. Three\r\nhundred metres, as I afterwards calculated the total distance\r\nto be, may seem little enough in the open, but to grope one’s\r\nway this distance by the light of a feeble candle along a passage\r\nso restricted that one has to proceed not only with bent head and\r\nshoulders, but half sideways, in a hot, steamy, stagnant atmosphere,\r\nis quite a different matter. My companion, being of small build and\r\nstature, was able to walk upright in comparative comfort, without\r\ncontinually bumping his head and bruising his shoulders, so that\r\nthe want of air did not tell on him to the same extent; while I\r\nbecame more and more fatigued, owing to the difficulty experienced\r\nof getting sufficient oxygen from such an atmosphere in the cramped\r\nposition I had of necessity to assume. On more than one occasion I\r\nsank exhausted into the water, the huge gasps of breath which I took\r\nseeming powerless to relieve the horrible sensation of stifling,\r\nand with the unpleasant prospect of getting drowned if I escaped\r\nsuffocation. Yet there seemed to be ten thousand devils tempting\r\nme onwards, and although I did not know how long life could be\r\nsupported under such conditions, a mad desire possessed me to see\r\nthe thing through; so that whenever I was able to progress a few\r\nyards it was towards the head of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nWhen eventually we reached our destination, some 15 to 20 metres\r\nbeyond the last man-hole, it was only to find that the tunnel just\r\nstopped. There was no more water emerging from the rock at the\r\nend than I had seen entering at a dozen small fissures along the\r\ncourse we had traversed; there was no vertical excavation downwards;\r\nthere were no traces of inscriptions; nothing, in fact. After all\r\nour trouble, we had drawn a blank. Although I positively dreaded\r\nthe long crawl back, the very fact that every step took us towards\r\nthe fresh air made me feel comparatively cheerful. After making my\r\nexamination of the end of the tunnel, however, I found the space was\r\ninsufficient to allow of my turning round, so that I was compelled\r\nto proceed backwards for some distance before I found room in which\r\nto turn. I must confess to never having experienced such a feeling\r\nof relief as when we eventually arrived at the bottom of the open\r\nshaft, and were able to fill our lungs with copious draughts of the\r\nair descending from above. We could see the tiny pin-hole of light\r\nfar above us, and when sufficiently rested we swung the rope as\r\na signal to be wound up. Although I got back to the surface none\r\nthe worse for my adventure, with the exception of skin bruises,\r\nI would not recommend anyone to attempt the exploration of other\r\nsimilar tunnels unless there were open shafts on either side to\r\ninsure some circulation of air.\r\n\r\nIt is now quite certain that the aqueducts derived their water\r\nfrom the numerous small fissures traversed, so that the yield\r\nof any single tunnel must have depended to a great extent on its\r\ntotal length. The general formation of the country determined the\r\ngeneral direction of the tunnels, which, in order to keep within\r\nreasonable distance of the surface, had to follow the valleys. The\r\nlatter, without exception in this district, run in a north and\r\nsouth direction, having formed at one time drainage-lines from the\r\nhigh plateau to the north. Many of the short branch tunnels are,\r\nhowever, driven along east and west fissures, though these could\r\nnot be followed to any great distance, owing to the high ridges\r\nseparating the valleys. It is also quite certain that the work of\r\nexcavation was eventually stopped by the ever-increasing labour\r\ninvolved in the construction of the vertical shafts, the depth of\r\nwhich necessarily increased at a rapid rate as the surface of the\r\nground rose when nearing the actual escarpment. For instance, in the\r\nspace of only 230 metres, between the ninth and the first shafts,\r\nthe depth of the man-holes increases from 40 to 54 metres, and to\r\nthe north of this the increase would have been still more rapid,\r\nuntil the amount of vertical excavation would have become altogether\r\ndisproportionate to the horizontal distance gained by the aqueduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                  BORING METHODS: ANCIENT AND MODERN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Skill of the Ancients in Well-Boring — Present State of the\r\nAncient Wells — Ancient Methods of Boring — Wooden Casing —\r\nIntroduction of Machinery by Egyptian Government — Native Methods\r\nof Boring at the Present Day — Cleaning of Wells — Divers and\r\ntheir Work — Recent Boring Operations — American Steam-driven\r\nBoring Rigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlympiodorus, writing more than 1,500 years ago, remarked that\r\nthe inhabitants of the oases were celebrated for their skill in\r\nsinking wells. Although at the present day a large proportion of\r\nthe very ancient wells are completely sanded up, or have suffered\r\ngreat deterioration in respect of their flows, there are still many\r\nexamples to be met with where bores, certainly between 2,000 and\r\n3,000 years old, are still producing strong discharges of water at\r\nthe rate of hundreds of gallons a minute by day and by night.\r\n\r\nAlthough scores of the old wells have been cleaned out and repaired\r\nin modern times, not a single instance has come under my notice\r\nof the finding of implements used by the well-borers of ancient\r\ntimes. We know, however, that the bores were in practically all cases\r\nlined to a considerable depth with wooden casing, manufactured from\r\nthe wood of the doum-palm, date-palm, or acacia, which doubtless\r\nwere then, as now, cultivated in large numbers in the oasis. The\r\ntimber was carefully fashioned into the required lengths and fitted\r\ntogether by water-tight joints. During the cleaning operations to\r\nwhich many of the old wells have been subjected in modern times,\r\nportions of the ancient casing have frequently been extracted, and\r\nsome of the examples which I have examined, especially those made of\r\nacacia, proved to be in an excellent state of preservation. The wood\r\nof this particular tree—‘sunt,’ as it is locally called—has\r\nremarkably enduring qualities both in and out of water, though\r\nnot when subjected to alternations of wet and dry. Still, that it\r\nshould in some cases have retained its original qualities since\r\nRoman times is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident, from a comparison of the ancient timbering\r\nand casing with those manufactured and used by the inhabitants of\r\nthe oases at the present day, that the methods of well-sinking in\r\nmodern times are in many respects identical with those anciently\r\nemployed. This is especially the case in sinking through the\r\nsuperficial strata—_i.e._, those overlying the actual beds in\r\nwhich the artesian water is held—though of the methods formerly\r\npractised for carrying the bore through the Artesian-water Sandstones\r\nnothing is known.\r\n\r\nWe have little, if any, information as to how the inhabitants kept\r\nup their water-supply after the withdrawal of the Romans. Probably\r\nthere was a gradual diminution of the total output, as it is not\r\nat all certain that any new wells were subsequently sunk—at any\r\nrate, until after the introduction of modern hand-boring machinery\r\nsome fifty or sixty years ago. On that occasion one Hassan Effendi,\r\na servant of a French engineer of the name of Lefèvre, was sent\r\nout by the Egyptian Government to instruct the inhabitants in the\r\nuse of the new machinery. Judging from their present proficiency\r\nin sinking wells through difficult strata with the most hopelessly\r\nworn and antiquated tackle, the natives did not take long to learn\r\nthe new system. Unfortunately, when left to themselves without\r\nadequate supervision, they promiscuously sunk a great number of new\r\nbores, without regard to the probable effects on the older wells\r\nirrigating the existing palm-groves and cultivated lands, with the\r\nresult that, more especially in the oasis of Dakhla, a great deal\r\nof harm was done. Whole districts suffered a general lowering of\r\nwater-level, many of the wells ceasing to flow altogether. This\r\nwas the direct outcome of the excessive number of new bores put\r\ndown in certain districts where the inhabitants were sufficiently\r\nrich and influential to get and retain possession of the majority\r\nof the newly-imported boring-rigs.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago I studied the method of well-sinking used in\r\nthe oases, and found it to consist of a combination of ancient and\r\nmodern boring practices. Owing to the difficulty and prohibitive\r\ncost of transporting heavy steel tubes across the desert, the use\r\nof locally-made wooden casing could not be dispensed with, and as\r\ncasing of this description could not possibly be made of sufficient\r\nstrength to stand ‘driving,’ the upper portion of the well had\r\nof necessity to take the form of an open shaft carried down as near\r\nas possible to the water-bearing beds, the actual boring by means\r\nof the drilling-plant being confined to the later stages.\r\n\r\nThe first operation consists in sinking a rectangular shaft, usually\r\n2 metres square; this work is carried out by hand, the ordinary\r\nnative ‘fass’ being almost the only implement used. As the shaft\r\nis cut out it is timbered with lengths of palm-wood strung one below\r\nthe other, to prevent the walls from falling in. The excavation\r\nis carried as deep as possible, the limit generally depending on\r\nthe amount of sub-surface water met with. In the oasis of Dakhla,\r\nwhere the superficial strata consist almost entirely of clays,\r\nit can usually be continued to a depth of about 30 metres; but in\r\nKharga the depth varies considerably, owing to the more frequent\r\nintercalations of water-logged sandstones. The success of the\r\nprospective bore depends to a very great extent on the depth to\r\nwhich this preliminary work is carried, as the succeeding strata,\r\nlying between the base of the shaft and the true artesian beds,\r\nhave to be pierced by a hole unprotected by casing, and if of any\r\nvery considerable thickness, caving beds are likely to greatly\r\ninterfere with, if not prevent, the progress of the work.\r\n\r\nOn completion of the timbered shaft the wooden casing is placed\r\ncentrally in position, so as to form a vertical pipe from the base of\r\nthe shaft to the surface of the ground. The pipe may be either square\r\nor round in section, and is usually made of acacia, though hollowed\r\ntrunks of doum-palm are sometimes used. It consists of a number of\r\ndifferent sections, joined together in such a way as to leave no\r\nprojecting portions either within or without, the whole length of\r\ncasing thus preserving a constant diameter from top to bottom. As\r\na rule, the joints are so well formed that the pipe is, to all\r\nintents and purposes, water-tight after a short soaking. The square\r\nvariety of casing usually has an inside width of 36 centimetres,\r\nthe thickness of the wood being 4 or 5 centimetres; the circular,\r\nand perhaps more common, variety is made with an inside diameter\r\nof 35 centimetres, except when required for insertion within a\r\npreviously fixed string of casing, when smaller sizes have to be\r\nused. The casing, of course, eventually forms the actual channel\r\nthrough which the artesian water flows to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe space intervening between the sides of the timbered shaft and\r\nthe central pipe is then filled in with a mixture of sand and clay,\r\nfirmly packed down, so as to hold the pipe securely in position, and\r\nprevent the escape of water should any of the joints become leaky.\r\n\r\nUp to this point there is good reason to believe that the modern\r\npractice is similar to, if not identical with, that anciently used;\r\nbut in the complete absence of evidence, documentary or otherwise,\r\nwe cannot conjecture how the old well-sinkers proceeded in subsequent\r\nstages. We surmise, however, that, given sufficiency of time, they\r\nwere possessed of the requisite patience and skill to overcome\r\nall ordinary obstacles—as has been the case for generations in\r\nChina—and it is probable that the percentage of wells abandoned\r\nwas not greater than it is at the present day in countries where\r\nwell-boring has become an art, carried out by means of scientifically\r\ndesigned machinery.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the modern operations is conducted with an\r\nordinary percussion hand-boring outfit of European manufacture. As\r\nthe method of boring with this type of rig is essentially the same\r\nall over the world, we only propose to describe it in brief. The\r\nproceedings commence with the erection of a timber framework,\r\nor derrick, immediately over the mouth of the pipe; at the summit\r\nof the derrick is a pulley, over which passes the rope or chain\r\nwhich connects on one side with the drum of the winch, and from\r\nthe end of which, on the other side, are suspended the actual tools\r\nwith which drilling is continued. The boring-rod is made up to the\r\nrequired length by screwing together a number of 10-foot sections,\r\nthe terminal length being a shorter rod fitted with a chisel, auger,\r\nor sand-pump, according to the work in hand.\r\n\r\nThe rate of progress depends to a great extent on the rapidity with\r\nwhich the blows of the chisel are delivered. This, of course,\r\nvaries considerably, depending on the depth of the well and\r\nconsequent weight of the rods in use. Where the weight is great\r\nand the formation sticky, the rods have to be lifted by means of\r\nthe winch, and not more than two or three blows a minute can be\r\nstruck. When the rods are light or working freely, as, for instance,\r\nwhen drilling in sandstones, the winch can be dispensed with, and the\r\nnecessary motion conveyed by means of a lever actuated by a number\r\nof men. In this way progress can be very much accelerated, as many\r\nas twenty or twenty-five blows being delivered per minute. At the\r\nbest, however, the method of drilling by percussion with a solid\r\nrod is necessarily slow, owing mainly to the fact that the terminal\r\ntool cannot be changed or withdrawn without the entire length of\r\nrod being taken to pieces. It is seldom, therefore, that a well of\r\n120 to 150 metres is completed in less than five months, and the\r\naverage time taken is more like nine months or a year.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be admitted that this method of sinking wells is\r\nin many respects well adapted to the local conditions obtaining\r\nin such isolated localities as the oases, where time is of little\r\nconsequence to the inhabitants. The completed wells are frequently\r\nequal in almost every respect to those put down by means of the most\r\nup-to-date appliances; in fact, the only objections to the method\r\nare its slowness, the limited depth to which it is applicable,\r\nand the difficulty of fixing to the wooden casing satisfactory\r\nappliances for regulating the discharge.\r\n\r\nThe patience and industry of the inhabitants of the oases are well\r\nexemplified by their unceasing attempts to maintain undiminished the\r\nwater-supply on which their very existence depends. The population\r\nmust always have borne a direct ratio to the total discharge of the\r\nwells, as on the latter depends the amount of food-supplies which\r\ncan be raised. At no period, as far as we can judge, has the output\r\nof the wells been greater than the requirements, and it is probable\r\nthat there has always been a population somewhat in excess of that\r\nwhich could be supported by local products, the surplus portion\r\nbeing disposed of by emigration to the Nile Valley.\r\n\r\nThe methods of dealing with wells in which the flows have diminished\r\nor altogether ceased are of considerable interest, as they have\r\ngiven rise to a class of men called ‘ghattasin’ (divers),\r\nwhich one would never have expected to find in such remote and arid\r\nlocalities as the oases of the Libyan Desert.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that the poorer inhabitants can command the use of a\r\nhand-rig for the cleaning of their wells, so that they usually have\r\nrecourse to appliances of the most primitive description. Perhaps\r\nthe simplest form consists of a short iron rod, a sort of crowbar\r\nor jumper, suspended from a palm-fibre rope, and with a tiny basket\r\nattached to the lower end. In some cases the end of the jumper\r\nis itself fashioned into the form of a cup, so that the basket of\r\nplaited grass or palm-leaf can be dispensed with. The rod is worked\r\nup and down in the bore, so as to stir up the sand and clay at the\r\nbottom, which settles in the basket or cup, and is periodically\r\nhoisted to the surface. The rope is worked over a wooden roller\r\nfixed alongside the mouth of the well, a contrivance which enables\r\nthe up-and-down motion to be given with a minimum of energy and\r\nfriction. The process is often continued for years, the material\r\nwhich can be removed in a day only amounting to a few handfuls.\r\n\r\nThe above method is only applicable to bores in which the wooden\r\ncasing is more or less intact. Where the latter has rotted and\r\nallowed the sides of the well to collapse, a much more difficult\r\nand complicated procedure is necessary before the discharge can\r\nbe re-established. In a case of this sort the original rectangular\r\nshaft has to be entirely cleared of material, and a new string of\r\ncasing placed in the exact position occupied by the original pipe\r\nof the well. Moreover, the timber of the shaft itself has generally\r\nto be repaired or entirely renewed, as otherwise there would be\r\nvery great danger of the sides collapsing when the material from\r\nwithin was removed. The process is rendered extremely difficult\r\nand laborious by reason of the entire work having to be carried on\r\nunder water. Although a well may have stopped flowing, the passages\r\nare never so completely blocked as to altogether prevent the water\r\nfrom rising to within a few feet of the surface, and any excavation\r\nmade will always be found to become speedily filled with water. The\r\nwork can, therefore, only be carried out by men who have trained\r\nthemselves to remain and work under water, and a limited number of\r\nthese divers are found in most of the Egyptian oases.\r\n\r\nI have frequently watched and chatted with the divers at work on\r\nold wells, both in Dakhla and Kharga. Unlike the usual custom of\r\nremunerating men employed on well-cleaning by shares of the resulting\r\nwater, divers are generally paid in cash at the rate of about a\r\nshilling a day, each man receiving his food as well. The descent\r\nis always made feet first, hand over hand down a rope stretched\r\nfrom the top to the bottom. When the diver wishes to return to the\r\nsurface he signals by a motion of the rope to those at the top,\r\nwho promptly haul him up.\r\n\r\nThe rate of progress depends, of course, on the depth at which the\r\nwork is proceeding. In a well I once visited near Hindaw, in the\r\noasis of Dakhla, divers were working at a depth of 29 metres. Each\r\nman descended six or seven times a day, remaining on each occasion\r\nfrom two to two and a half minutes under water. Work had been in\r\nprogress here for four years, and the excavation was still 16 or\r\n17 metres from the bottom of the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe excavated material is placed in baskets, which, when full,\r\nare drawn up by hand. As soon as the shaft has been cleared to the\r\nbottom the new casing is inserted, the intervening space filled in,\r\nand the work carried on as in a new bore. Many extinct wells have\r\nthus been put into good working order, though in some cases the\r\ndivers have been unable to overcome the difficulties encountered,\r\nand the wells have been finally abandoned after months, or even\r\nyears, of labour.\r\n\r\nIn the reclamation operations conducted in the oasis of Kharga\r\nduring the last two or three years, both hand and steam boring rigs\r\nhave been employed, steel casing being used for all wells. The cost\r\nper foot drilled is somewhat in favour of the hand-rigs, but the\r\nrate of progress is far more rapid in the case of the steam-driven\r\nmachines. The method used with the hand-machines is the same in\r\nprinciple as that employed by the natives and already described,\r\nwith the exception that the preliminary excavation is dispensed with,\r\nthe bore being drilled from the surface and lined with metal casing\r\ndown to the Water-bearing Sandstones. The casing is driven by means\r\nof a heavy weight, or ‘monkey,’ attached to the boring-rod.\r\n\r\nThe steam-rigs used are of American manufacture, and of the design\r\nusually employed in the oil-fields of the United States. The method\r\nis a modern adaptation of a practice employed from very early times\r\nin China, free-falling tools attached to a flexible rope being used\r\nin place of a solid iron rod. The actual drilling tool, which is of\r\ngreat weight, is suspended from a cable, and worked by steam-power in\r\nsuch a way as to give a rapid succession of blows of such force as\r\nto cut out a circular hole through the hardest of rocks. The outfit\r\nconsists essentially of a very high derrick, a large drum on which\r\nthe cable is wound, and a specially-designed engine worked by steam,\r\nthe boiler in which the latter is generated being usually placed\r\non a separate carriage. A second and smaller drum is provided for\r\na fine wire rope, which is used with various forms of sand-pump for\r\ncleaning out the loose sand or sludge formed by the drilling tool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STEAM BORING RIG.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HAND BORING RIG.]\r\n\r\nThese steam-rigs necessitate the employment of skilled drillers,\r\nand are, moreover, with difficulty kept in proper repair in\r\nout-of-the-way localities. Their initial cost is high; they are\r\nextremely cumbersome to drag from one site to another over the\r\nsoft surface of the desert, and they consume a large quantity\r\nof fuel. These drawbacks are, however, partly, if not entirely,\r\ncounterbalanced by the rapidity with which the work can be carried\r\nout, the average rate of progress under the conditions met with\r\nin the oasis being 5 to 7 metres per ‘shift’ of eight or ten\r\nhours. In the water-sandstones I have known Mr. B. F. Whiting, who\r\nwas recently my drilling superintendent in the oasis, carry a bore\r\ndown as much as 20 or 25 metres in a single shift. Breakdowns are, of\r\ncourse, not infrequent with this system of boring, but the American\r\ndrillers are remarkably proficient in the recovery of lost tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n              THE CONTEST BETWEEN MAN AND WIND-BORNE SAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Winds — Wind and Sand as Agents of Denudation — The Combat\r\nof the Inhabitants with Sand-laden Winds — The Dune-Belts —\r\nOrigin of the Sand — Composition of Dune-Sand — The Forms of\r\nDunes — Dimensions and Rate of Movement — Irresistibility of\r\nBlown Sand — Protection afforded by Topographical Features —\r\nEffect of Artificial Obstructions on the Formation of Dunes —\r\nFixing of Dunes by Vegetation and Moisture — Storm-Walls and\r\nFences — The Dunes of Gennâh — Wind-borne Sand beneficial\r\nin the South of the Oasis — Formation of Terraces of Wind-borne\r\nMaterials — Encroachment of Dunes in the South of the Oasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one who has sojourned in Kharga long enough to compare it with\r\nother parts of Egypt will feel inclined to dispute the statement that\r\nthe depression is one of the most windy places in the country. Only\r\none day in ten or eleven is calm, though if the wind has been\r\nblowing fairly steadily during the day it generally drops at\r\nnight. Five times out of six its direction is from the north, and\r\nwhen unaccompanied by sand the wind acts as a welcome moderator of\r\nthe temperature.\r\n\r\nIn a desert region, owing to the surface being unprotected\r\nby vegetation, there is nearly always an abundance of weathered\r\nmaterial loosely exposed on the surface, the lighter portions of\r\nwhich are quickly swept up and carried along as soon as the wind\r\nattains even a moderate velocity. On the actual dunes even a light\r\nbreeze is sufficient to set the surface-layers in motion, while on\r\nthe open plain the wind becomes visibly charged with sand directly it\r\nattains the velocity of a moderate breeze. The frequency with which\r\nthe wind blows has already been mentioned, and when we add that on\r\none day in three it attains a velocity sufficient to enable it to\r\neasily carry sand in suspension, its power as a transporting agent\r\ncan readily be conceived. Not only does the wind carry the sand\r\nalong from one place to another, dumping it behind or in front of\r\nevery obstacle it may meet, but the combination of sand and wind\r\nforms a denuding force of no mean power, capable of planing and\r\ngrooving the exposed surfaces of the hardest of rocks.\r\n\r\nNow, although opinions may differ as to the part played in\r\nthe past by wind and sand in the shaping and formation of the\r\noases-depressions of the Libyan Desert, there can be no question\r\nof the effects they are producing at the present day. Wind-borne\r\nsand is indeed the curse of the oasis, and although its evil\r\neffects may be mitigated or altogether staved off for a time,\r\nthe longer this force of Nature is opposed by man the greater and\r\nmore overwhelming is its final victory. If a full account of the\r\nhuman occupation of the oases could be written, it would be very\r\nlargely the history of an incessant combat between man and Nature;\r\nand although man may for a time gain the upper hand, and even make\r\nthe sand-laden winds to some extent serve his purposes, he is in\r\nthe end generally forced to abandon those places in which he has\r\nbeen at such pains to establish himself.\r\n\r\nIn the Libyan Desert, both on the plateaux and in the depressions,\r\nblown sand has a marked tendency to collect into dunes occupying\r\ndefinite north and south belts of country, lying parallel to the\r\ndirection of the prevailing winds. This peculiar and fortunate\r\ndisposition depends on a number of circumstances, such as the\r\nmean direction of the wind, the points of greatest supply of\r\nthe material, and on other causes which are not perhaps as yet\r\nthoroughly understood.\r\n\r\nIn Kharga Oasis the best marked and most important belt lies somewhat\r\nto the west of the central axis of the depression. At the north end,\r\nin the neighbourhood of Um el Dabâdib, it consists of a number of\r\nisolated but parallel lines of dunes, which southwards pass over\r\nand round the hill-massif of Jebel Tarif, eventually uniting and\r\nforming a more compact belt of sand, with an average width of 8 or\r\n10 kilometres, which continues right through the depression into the\r\ndesert to the south. This line of sand sets a limit to the extension\r\nof cultivation to the west. A second belt comes from the plateau to\r\nthe north of Qasr Lebekha, passes immediately to the east of Jebel\r\nTêr and the village of Kharga, and continues southwards until it\r\nspreads out and is arrested, more or less by artificial means, in\r\nthe vicinity of Gennâh. Other smaller and less defined belts exist\r\nto the south of Ain el Tawîl, to the east of Headquarters, and near\r\nthe foot of, and parallel to, the eastern wall of the depression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BELT OF DUNES NEAR QASR LEBEKHA.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been stated by more than one writer that the great\r\nsand accumulations of the Libyan Desert originate in the denudation\r\nof the Nubian Sandstone which occupies large areas to the south of\r\nthe oases, I have never myself met with any evidence in support of\r\nsuch a view. In my opinion the bulk of the sand must be regarded as\r\noriginating in the arenaceous deposits of post-Middle Eocene age,\r\nwhich largely occupy and are exposed on the surface of the country\r\nbetween the Mediterranean Sea and latitude 29° N. We know from\r\npersonal observation that some of the great sand-belts, which cross\r\nthe intervening limestone plateau to the southern oases, commence in\r\nthis region, and the supply of sand made available by the denudation\r\nof the beds in question is inexhaustible. During the passage of\r\nthis sand across the great desert tableland the individual grains of\r\nsilica doubtless become much rounded and reduced by attrition, though\r\nthe total loss is probably more than counterbalanced by the very\r\nconsiderable additions received in the form of calcareous grains,\r\nderived from the limestones forming the surface of the high desert.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the dunes of Kharga Oasis at once shows that\r\nthe sand is not by any means composed solely of siliceous grains,\r\nbut that there is a considerable proportion of white granules of\r\nlimestone. A number of samples collected at random from the dunes\r\nin the central part of the depression were all found to contain\r\na visible proportion of calcareous grains, and one of these,\r\ncollected from the big dune to the south-east of Headquarters,\r\nwas qualitatively examined for me by Mr. Garsed, and shown to\r\ncontain 7·7 per cent. of calcium carbonate. It would be difficult\r\nto account for the presence of these calcareous grains on the\r\nassumption that the sand is derived from the Nubian Sandstone,\r\nthough the denudation of the latter in and to the south of the\r\noases must give rise to a very large amount of siliceous sand,\r\nwhich goes to swell the bulk of the dunes which have invaded this\r\ncountry from beyond the limestone plateau to the north.\r\n\r\nThe dominant form of dune in the oasis is of crescentic or horse-shoe\r\nshape, a form specially typical of desert regions where there\r\nare prevailing winds in any one direction. These ‘barchans,’\r\nas they are called, which are always disposed with the concave,\r\nsteeply-inclined sides facing southwards, are found of every size,\r\nand exhibit many variations of the simple crescentic pattern. In\r\nmany parts of the oasis the sand-belts are made up of a number of\r\nisolated and promiscuously disposed barchans; in others the dunes\r\nhave joined together into a compact mass, in which the typical\r\nshape of the individual barchan is more or less obliterated.\r\n\r\nSolitary barchans, being well-defined isolated masses, lend\r\nthemselves to observation better than the large and continuous\r\nbelts of sand. They occur of all sizes, from little baby crescents,\r\na metre or two across, to enormous masses 30 or 40 metres high and\r\n200 to 300 metres in breadth. In all cases, except when their steady\r\nmarch southwards has been temporarily interrupted by southerly\r\nwinds, the southern face, flanked by the horns of the crescent,\r\nis a straight slope of from 30 to 33 degrees, its inclination is,\r\nin fact, the angle of rest of loose dry sand, and it is formed\r\nof the sand which is continually blown up the opposite slope and\r\ndropped over the crest.\r\n\r\nIn a moderate breeze the whole barchan progresses steadily in a\r\nsoutherly direction without loss or gain of sand; in stronger winds,\r\nwhile still continuing its course, the dune may at the same time\r\nbe either losing or gaining in actual bulk. The rate at which the\r\nbarchans travel varies with their size. The larger the dune the\r\ngreater the amount of material to be moved, so that, as a general\r\nrule, small barchans progress much more rapidly than large ones. The\r\nactual rate may vary from 10 to 20 metres per annum, the average\r\nbeing about 17. For instance, the big isolated dune on the road\r\nbetween Headquarters and Kharga village moved 11 metres southwards\r\nbetween December 8, 1907, and December 8, 1908, while during the same\r\nperiod a small dune in the Bellaida district travelled 21 metres in\r\nthe same direction. The dimensions of these two dunes is as follows:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------------+----------+\r\n  |                                    | Kharga Road | Bellaida |\r\n  |                                    |    Dune.    |   Dune.  |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------------+----------+\r\n  |                                    |   Metres.   |  Metres. |\r\n  | Vertical height of centre of crest |      17     |     10·5 |\r\n  | Maximum breadth (east and west)    |     259     |    160   |\r\n  | Maximum length (north and south)   |     230     |     70   |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------------+----------+\r\n\r\nThese are merely instances from dunes which I have had under\r\nobservation for a number of months, full details of which I hope\r\nshortly to publish.\r\n\r\nApproached on a bright sunny day from the south side, the angle of\r\nslope within the crescent of a barchan is most deceptive. Nine out\r\nof ten persons will confidently state that the face of the dune\r\ncannot be less than 60 or 70 degrees from the horizontal, though,\r\nas a matter of fact, it never exceeds by more than two or three\r\ndegrees a third of a right angle. Unless held together by vegetation\r\nor compacted by moisture, it cannot exceed the angle of rest of dry\r\nblown sand, which is about 32 degrees. In normal weather this face\r\nof a barchan is a straight, unrippled, even slope of loose sand from\r\ntop to bottom; when a light or gentle breeze is blowing from the\r\nnorth, the dune can be seen ‘smoking’ at the top of the crest,\r\nthe sand being blown up the much more gentle and markedly rippled\r\nnortherly slope, and dropped over the crest on to the steep, smooth,\r\nsoutherly face. The bulk of this sand in a light breeze falls on the\r\nupper part of the slope, equilibrium being adjusted from time to time\r\nby a downward sliding of the superficial layers. A cross-section of\r\nthe dune, from north to south, would indeed show it to be composed\r\nof well-stratified layers of sand, dipping steadily southwards at\r\na little over 30 degrees.\r\n\r\nIn this district I have never observed southerly winds hold for a\r\nsufficient length of time to do more than slightly modify the general\r\nform of a barchan, though during their continuance the progress of\r\nthe dune is arrested, the outline of the crest becomes considerably\r\naltered, ripple-marks appear on the steep southerly face, and an\r\napron of sand of greater or lesser dimensions forms at its foot.\r\n\r\nThe irresistibility of drift sand is well seen where isolated\r\nhills lie in the path of the dunes. When such hills are narrow,\r\nand elongated in a north and south direction, they generally act\r\nas a wedge, divide the wind, and force any sand it may be carrying\r\nto pass on either side. When, however, a hill has northerly flanks\r\nof any considerable width, it will only form a temporary check to\r\nthe southward passage of the sand. The progress of the latter may\r\nbe arrested for a while, until hollows have been filled in and the\r\ngeneral slopes reduced; but eventually the sand will pass up along\r\nthe lines of least resistance to the summit. This is beautifully\r\nillustrated at Jebel Tarif, the great isolated, flat-topped,\r\nhill-massif lying between Um el Dabâdib and Kharga village,\r\nstanding over 300 metres, or 1,000 feet, above the surrounding\r\nplain. Instead of being diverted by this obstacle, the sand, coming\r\nfrom the plateau to the north and north-west of Um el Dabâdib,\r\nsurmounts the slopes, and continues in its normal direction across\r\nthe flat-topped summit. The latter has been cut up into numberless\r\nparallel north- and south-disposed ridges, separated by deep troughs,\r\nwhich are now to a considerable extent filled with sand. Active\r\nerosion must, therefore, at the present day be confined to the upper\r\nportions of the slopes of the valleys and to the intervening ridges.\r\n\r\nNaturally in such a region the inhabitants have been quick to take\r\nadvantage of any protection afforded by topographical features, and\r\nit is not surprising to find that the most important of the ancient\r\nmonuments, as well as the greatest area of modernly cultivated land,\r\nlie in a comparatively sheltered position to the south of Jebel\r\nTêr. Even there, however, trouble is constantly experienced on the\r\neast side, owing to the tendency of the belt of sand-dunes, which\r\ncomes from the vicinity of Qasr Lebekha, to spread laterally. Along\r\nthe east side of the village the dunes are close up against the\r\noutlying houses, and the sand continually surmounts and pours over\r\nthe walls which from time to time are erected by the natives to\r\nact as barricades.\r\n\r\nSheltered places of the above description are rare, the majority of\r\nthe smaller settlements being situated on the open plain, where the\r\nonly precaution which can be taken is to select the sites for wells\r\nas far away as possible from the well-defined sand-belts. But in\r\nwindy weather the sand-blast is not confined to the neighbourhood of\r\nthe dunes; the wind rages across the open plains, carrying dense\r\nclouds of sand in suspension, and devastating the works of man\r\nwherever the latter offer the slightest obstacle to its progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAND EROSION ON SUMMIT OF JEBEL TARIF.]\r\n\r\nIn order to protect his crops from the fierce onslaught of wind-borne\r\nsand the native is compelled to erect fences and barricades along the\r\nnorthern boundaries of his fields. These serve his purpose for the\r\ntime being, the sand which would otherwise have cut and beaten down\r\nthe growing crops being deposited on either side of the fence, where\r\nthe velocity of the wind is checked. The arrested sand accumulates\r\nwith increasing rapidity as the size of the obstruction becomes\r\ngreater, a veritable dune, constituting a really efficient protection\r\nto the cultivated lands, being formed over the site of the original\r\nsmall and insignificant hedge. Unfortunately, this sand continues\r\nto collect, and although the cultivator may have satisfactorily\r\ninsured himself against the frequent damage caused to his crops by\r\ntheir exposure to wind-driven sand, he is now confronted with the\r\nstill more serious prospect of having his lands overwhelmed by the\r\never-increasing dunes, which have grown to considerable proportions\r\nas the result of his efforts to protect himself.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the occupiers of these outlying settlements, the\r\nprogress of such dunes, formed more or less artificially on the\r\nnortherly sides of the cultivated tracts, is not at the same rate as\r\nthat of isolated dunes moving across the open desert plain. Owing\r\nto the presence of a certain amount of moisture in the superficial\r\nlayers of the ground in the neighbourhood of the wells and the\r\ncultivated lands, plants of various kinds are enabled to thrive,\r\nwith the result that the dunes become to some extent ‘fixed’ by\r\nwild vegetation. The most valuable plant in this connection is the\r\ntamarisk, which by means of immensely long roots continues to thrive\r\nand keep its head above growing dunes with remarkable facility. To\r\na certain extent, moreover, the moisture from the soil itself\r\nrises by capillarity into the base of the sand, and assists the\r\nvegetation in binding it into a compact mass, which is not liable\r\nto movement in the same degree as dry sand. The rate of progress\r\nof such dunes may therefore be reduced to a considerable extent,\r\nbut the movement can never be altogether stopped. As we have seen\r\nin the case of the hamlet of Meheriq, the sand eventually gets the\r\nupper hand, blotting out the arable lands, burying the palm-groves,\r\nand forcing man to abandon his habitations.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the Corporation’s Headquarters a\r\nconsiderable area of the floor of the depression has been brought\r\nunder cultivation during the last three years. This tract is exposed\r\non every side, there being no protection whatever in the shape of\r\nnatural features. Although occasional sandstorms are experienced\r\nfrom the south, and even from the east and west sides, practically\r\nthe whole of the trouble encountered comes from northerly sandstorms\r\nand sand-laden winds. It was found quite impossible to raise crops\r\nunless the fields were protected by storm-walls or fences, the young\r\nplants being cut down as if by a scythe. So long as the reclamation\r\nof land proceeded from south to north at a fairly rapid rate, the\r\naccumulation of sand against these fences was of little moment,\r\nbeing, indeed, rather welcome than otherwise, as the sand was found\r\nto be of considerable value when spread out and ploughed into the\r\nheavy clay soil with which this area is superficially covered. When,\r\nhowever, a storm-wall remains for several consecutive months\r\nexposed to the open desert to the north, the accumulation of sand\r\nbecomes a more serious matter, and care has to be taken to avoid\r\nthe formation of dunes, which it might be afterwards difficult to\r\nget rid of. A fairly satisfactory mode of procedure is the planting\r\nof narrow belts of ‘sesban,’ or other quickly-growing shrub,\r\nalong the northern limits of the newly reclaimed lands; a hedge of\r\nthis description forms an efficient shelter to the fields, while at\r\nthe same time it allows a good deal of the sand to filter through\r\nand become absorbed by the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORPORATION’S HOMESTEAD (HEADQUARTERS).]\r\n\r\nMost of the dunes in the Gennâh district are more or less covered\r\nwith tamarisk and other wild vegetation, but that their progression\r\nsouthwards has only been retarded, and not prevented, is evident\r\nfrom an examination of the country. Large areas of land have been\r\nabandoned owing to the invasion of the dunes, and the magnificent\r\nwells of Gennâh are threatened with destruction within a very short\r\nterm of years, unless special measures are adopted to cope with\r\nthe advance of the sand. The available land in the vicinity of the\r\nvillage has long been insufficient to utilize the water discharged\r\nby these wells, which has in consequence to be led by a channel of\r\nseveral kilometres in length to lower ground south-east of the Gorn\r\nel Gennâh. This channel is being constantly pushed to the south,\r\nand as the ground rises in that direction, it may eventually become\r\nimpossible to maintain the conduit at a sufficiently low level to\r\ncarry the water of the wells to this outlying district.\r\n\r\nThe southern portion of the oasis is the only area where sand and\r\nwind can be said to be of any actual benefit to the inhabitants,\r\nbut in this area, owing to the broad plains of alluvial clay,\r\nthe suspended material consists to a very great extent of fine\r\nargillaceous particles. At many of the wells in the Dakhakhin and\r\nBeris districts the cultivators encourage the gradual deposition\r\non their fields of the sand and clay-dust borne by the northerly\r\nwinds. The mixture forms an excellent loam, and an annual dressing\r\nof the material is regarded as desirable, and even necessary, on\r\naccount of its value as a fertilizer. The result of this gradual\r\ndeposition of wind-borne material has been that the cultivated\r\nterraces have in many cases attained to such elevations that the\r\ndischarges of the wells have suffered very considerable diminution,\r\nowing to the increased height of the outlets.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the villages of Maks and Beris the great belt of sand\r\nhas already enveloped a number of wells, and appears to be still\r\nencroaching—as the individual dunes follow their normal course in\r\na direction slightly east of south—on the area occupied by the\r\nexisting cultivated lands. Fortunately there are still extensive\r\ntracts of cultivable land comparatively free from accumulations\r\nof drift sand, and doubtless the inhabitants, when driven by the\r\nirresistible forces of Nature from the localities they now occupy,\r\nwill again, as they have so frequently been compelled to do in the\r\npast, migrate to pastures new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                 SOME ECONOMICAL ASPECTS OF THE OASIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Staple Crops of the Oasis — Rice the Summer Crop in Northern\r\nKharga — The Value of Rice in the Reclamation of Land — The\r\nDate Harvest — Conditions under which the Date-Palm flourishes\r\n— Varieties — Propagation — The Doum-Palm — Lucerne — Its\r\nValue in Land-Reclamation — The Vine — Oranges and Other Fruits\r\n— The Wadi Molûk — Earthy Minerals — The Ancient Alum Mines\r\n— The Phosphatic Deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe staple crops of the oasis are dates, rice, wheat, and barley,\r\nwhile for fodder large quantities of lucerne are grown. It seems\r\nat first sight a curious anomaly that in an arid region, where\r\nwater is so scarce and precious a commodity, rice should be grown\r\nas the summer crop. Few, if any, plants require such an abundance\r\nof water as rice, which from the time of sowing to that of reaping\r\nhas to be continually irrigated by fresh water, the fields being,\r\nindeed, during the whole period that the crop is on the ground, in a\r\nconstant state of saturation. Rice does not thrive in stagnant water,\r\nand it is noticeable that the best crops in the oasis are raised on\r\nlands which have a decided slope, and over which fresh water can\r\nbe kept constantly running. The proper irrigation of a rice-field\r\nis a matter of no small difficulty, and the ingenious manner in\r\nwhich the oasis cultivator lays out his irrigating channels and\r\nsubdivides them by means of notched weirs, so as to insure every\r\nportion of the crop getting a continuous supply of fresh water,\r\nis well worthy of close examination.\r\n\r\nIn the Nile Delta, according to Sir William Willcocks,[13] rice\r\nrequires about twice as much water as the other commonly-grown crops,\r\nbut in the oases I do not think I am mistaken in saying that it\r\nneeds three times as much as any other grain. Rice appears to have\r\nbeen grown from time immemorial, and certainly at the present day\r\nthe inhabitants would as soon think of giving up their date-trees\r\nas of replacing it by any other crop. Now, however, that facilities\r\nexist for the export of farm-produce to the Nile Valley markets,\r\nit will be interesting to observe whether rice will to any extent\r\nbe replaced by more valuable crops.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Egypt the summer crop is largely durra millet (sorghum),\r\nbut this plant does not thrive in the oasis, though whether on\r\naccount of an uncongenial soil or owing to unsuitable climatic\r\nconditions I am unable to say. It has frequently been tried—in\r\nfact, small areas are annually planted, but never produce crops—at\r\nany rate, in the northern part of Kharga—in any sense comparable\r\nwith those of the Nile Valley. The very fact that durra cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily grown suggests a probable reason why rice, the least\r\nvaluable of the Egyptian cereals, and the one requiring most water,\r\nis so universally grown in Northern Kharga. Rice, as is well known,\r\nwill grow on land containing a proportion of salts which would be\r\ninjurious, or even fatal, to the majority of crops, and will at\r\nthe same time exercise a beneficial and cleansing effect on such\r\nland. The growing of rice may therefore have come about through the\r\nactual necessity for a periodical cleansing of land, which would\r\notherwise have become salted to a sufficient extent to adversely\r\naffect other crops grown on the same ground. At the present day,\r\nbarley and wheat alternate with rice.\r\n\r\nThe thorough and prolonged soaking to which land is subject when\r\nunder rice is in itself of considerable value to succeeding crops,\r\nand in the reclamation of heavy clay-lands in the Headquarters\r\ndistrict my experience has been that as a first crop there is\r\nnothing to equal this cereal. In many cases, indeed, it was found\r\nto be the only crop which could be at all satisfactorily raised on\r\nnew lands with only a moderate application of manure. A good tilth,\r\nmoreover, is far more rapidly obtained than when other crops are\r\ngrown, the difference in the second and third years between lands\r\nwhich have and have not had rice on them being most marked.\r\n\r\nI was much surprised to find that rice is not grown in the southern\r\ndistricts of the oasis, with the exception of a couple of small areas\r\nnear Dakhakhin. Extended inquiries failed to elicit satisfactory\r\nreasons for this remarkable difference from the practice followed\r\nin the north, the universal reply to my questions being that they,\r\nthe inhabitants, in not growing rice, were merely following the\r\ncustom of their ancestors! I noticed, however, that durra was grown\r\non a much larger scale than in the north of the oasis, and that\r\nthe crops in some cases reached a fairly good standard. It seems\r\nprobable, therefore, that in this part of the depression the soil is\r\nof higher average quality, so that the land, renovated by the annual\r\ndeposition of a fresh layer of wind-borne sand and clay-dust in the\r\nmanner already described, does not need a periodical cleansing by\r\nrice. This, at least, is the only satisfactory explanation which\r\nhas occurred to me.\r\n\r\nThe harvesting of the date-crop in September and October is the\r\nmost important event of the year in Kharga Oasis. A large portion\r\nof the crop is exported to the Nile Valley, the Bedawin becoming\r\ntraders for the time being, and transporting the produce across the\r\ndesert by means of camels. There are over 60,000 adult date-palms,\r\nthe chief palm-groves being at Kharga, Gennâh, and Bulaq in\r\nthe north, and at Beris in the south. The selling-price in the\r\noasis fluctuates to some extent, but averages twenty piastres\r\na ‘weba’ of between 60 and 70 pounds, the weight of a weba\r\nvarying considerably according to the moistness of the fruit and\r\nthe astuteness of the man entrusted with the measuring. The price\r\nworks out roughly at 4 pounds for threepence.\r\n\r\nIn a book[14] entitled “The Great Sahara,” published nearly\r\nfifty years ago, Canon Tristram gives a very full account of\r\nthe cultivation of the date-palm in North Africa. The date-palm\r\n(_Phœnix dactilifera_) is a tree specially characteristic of the\r\nSahara, where the climate is marked by deficiency of rainfall and by\r\nconsiderable variations of temperature. Although it flourishes best\r\nin rainless regions, the date-palm will not fruit unless its roots\r\nare well watered; it must, indeed, as the native proverb puts it,\r\n‘have its head in the fire and its roots in water.’\r\n\r\nIn Egypt there are about fifty varieties of date-palm the chief kinds\r\nin Kharga Oasis being the Saîdi, Tamar, Fâlig, and Hamrâwi. The\r\nSaîdi dates of the oases are generally considered to be superior\r\nin flavour to almost any other Egyptian variety, and have in\r\nconsequence a ready sale in the Nile Valley. The other varieties\r\nare not exported to any great extent, except, perhaps, the Fâlig;\r\nthe Tamar, while producing a heavier crop than the other kinds,\r\nyields fruit of comparatively poor quality, which is on that\r\naccount almost entirely used for home consumption. The Hamrâwi\r\ntrees are very limited in number, but produce fruit of large size\r\nand excellent flavour; Hamrâwi dates are, however, I believe,\r\nregarded as having bad keeping properties.\r\n\r\nDates are met with of almost every variety of colour except pure\r\nblack or white. All the different kinds ripen at or about the same\r\ntime—in the early part of September. A tree will bear from eight\r\nto ten bunches, each carrying from 12 to 20 pounds of fruit, so\r\nthat in full bearing it will yield from 100 to 200 pounds of dates\r\nannually. The fruit exported from the oases, being entirely disposed\r\nof in the native markets of the Nile Valley, is packed and sewn up\r\nwithout any special care in palm-leaf baskets. For local use small\r\nquantities of selected fruit are frequently preserved in a moist\r\nstate in earthenware jars.\r\n\r\nDate-stones cast on the ground and accidentally buried under an\r\ninch or two of soil will germinate freely, but the resulting plants\r\nare of little use. Not one in a hundred will turn out of the same\r\nvariety as its parent, so that plants raised from seed must in the\r\ngreat majority of cases be regarded as bastards, of no value as\r\nfruit-producers. In Kharga all new trees are raised from slipped\r\nplants—that is to say, from the young shoots which spring up\r\nat the butts of the parent trees. These are detached and planted\r\nout separately on new ground. The greatest care has to be taken to\r\nprotect them from hot winds and sandstorms, and they must be watered\r\ndaily for a number of weeks after being planted. Growth is very\r\nslow for the first two years, and even under the most favourable\r\nconditions the trees will not commence to bear fruit for five or\r\nsix years. Date-palms come into full bearing when from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five years old, and may live to a century or more. Every\r\nyear the lowest ring of branches is cut off, so that the age of a\r\ntree can be fairly accurately ascertained by counting the rings\r\nof notches on the stem. The wild, unkempt, weather-beaten trees\r\noccasionally met with in outlying, uninhabited portions of the oasis\r\nhave a very different appearance from the trim, erect palms of the\r\ncultivated areas.\r\n\r\nIn the oases and in other parts of Egypt a fermented liquor called\r\n‘lagmi,’ with a peculiar insipid taste, is obtained by making\r\na deep incision in the top of the date-palm, the liquid oozing\r\nout and being collected in a vessel, generally made of the rind\r\nof a gourd. As much as 10 quarts can be obtained in a day, and\r\nthe tree may be bled once or twice a month without sustaining any\r\nharm; the operation may, in fact, prove of considerable benefit to\r\na sickly palm. A very strong spirit—date-brandy—is also made\r\nfrom the fruit.\r\n\r\nTristram records that the heart or cabbage of a date-palm, which\r\nin taste is said to resemble the sweet potato, is eaten by the\r\nnatives when a tree falls or is blown down. The uses to which the\r\nleaves, fibre, and wood of the date-palm are put are innumerable,\r\nand include the manufacture of such diverse articles as baskets,\r\nmats, ropes, and saddles.\r\n\r\nThe doum-palm, or gingerbread-tree, flourishes in a semi-wild state\r\nin many parts of the oasis, more especially in the tract of country\r\nlying between Gennâh and Bulaq. The fruit is brown and mealy,\r\nand, in localities where the trees are properly tended, is said\r\nto be very nutritious, and to resemble gingerbread in taste and\r\ncolour. In some parts of the Sahara the spongy internal portion of\r\nthe nut forms an important article of food, and when mixed with an\r\ninfusion of dates constitutes a cooling drink much valued for use\r\nin cases of febrile disorders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUM-PALMS AT AIN GIRM MESHIM.]\r\n\r\nAlthough pasture or grazing lands can hardly be said to exist in\r\nthe Western sense of the term, lucerne is very commonly grown in\r\nKharga to provide a supply of green fodder for cattle. The plant\r\nseems to be peculiarly adapted to the local conditions, and is\r\noften kept on the ground for long periods, the crop providing very\r\nfrequent cuttings and improving from year to year. It is seldom or\r\nnever grazed direct, probably for the reason that cattle are apt\r\nto pull the plants out by the roots, the ground on which it best\r\nthrives being very loose and sandy. In the reclamation of new lands,\r\nwhere the soil is deficient in organic matter and nitrogen, this\r\nleguminous plant has been found to be of very great value. Excellent\r\nresults were obtained at Headquarters on desert surfaces which\r\nhad never previously borne vegetation. On the more sandy areas\r\nthe plant quickly established itself, becoming in the second year\r\nan even and strongly-growing crop from 18 inches to 2 feet high,\r\nyielding heavy cuttings every few weeks. For benefiting a poor soil\r\nby the introduction of nitrogen from the atmosphere probably nothing\r\ncould be found to excel lucerne, which, judging by the numerous and\r\nwell-marked nodules formed on the roots, acts as a most efficient\r\nhost-plant for nitrogen-fixing bacteria. My attention was first\r\ndrawn to these nodules by Mr. D. Milne, who was formerly in charge\r\nof the agricultural work at Headquarters, and both he and my present\r\nassistant, Mohammed Said, an Egyptian agriculturist of wide practical\r\nexperience, have formed a very high opinion of the utility of lucerne\r\nin the reclamation and fertilization of raw and new desert soils.\r\n\r\nIn ancient days the vine was extensively cultivated in the oases,\r\nand under the Romans there appears to have been a considerable trade\r\nin wine. At the present day excellent oranges, as well as apricots,\r\nmulberries, and olives, are grown in both Kharga and Dakhla, but\r\nonly in comparatively small quantities, though the soil and climate\r\nappear to be eminently suited to the cultivation of fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nCotton cannot be said to be cultivated in the oases, as the very\r\noccasional plots one meets with are evidence that its culture is not\r\nunderstood by the natives, who aim at the production of wood rather\r\nthan fibre. Experiments made at Headquarters, however, show that\r\nmany Nile Valley crops not hitherto grown in Kharga, such as cotton,\r\nsugar-cane, and beans, can be successfully raised without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere exists in the possession of His Excellency Johnson Pasha,\r\nformerly of the Egyptian Ministry of Justice, a curious old Arabic\r\ndocument, purporting to describe the so-called Wadi el Molûk, or\r\nValley of the Kings, a depression or valley in which, according to\r\ntradition, large quantities of gold, silver, and other precious\r\nmetals exist. The place is described in true Oriental fashion,\r\nand the manuscript relates in detail how the route, starting from\r\nan old monastery in the neighbourhood of Esna, proceeds. According\r\nto the information given, the Wadi el Molûk would appear to lie\r\nsomewhere within the desert triangle between the points Esna, Aswân,\r\nand Beris, but although a number of more or less serious attempts\r\nhave been made to discover its whereabouts, this El Dorado has not\r\nyet been located. Judging by the geological conditions—so far as\r\nthey are known in the area in question—one might, with equally\r\ngood chances of success, search for metalliferous deposits of gold\r\nand silver in the Weald of the South of England.\r\n\r\nEarthy minerals exist in the oasis of Kharga, and appear to have\r\nbeen extensively mined by the ancients in some localities. Deposits\r\nof ochre occur near several of the wells to the east and south-east\r\nof Kharga village, notably to the west of Ain Aid, to the west of\r\nAin Khalîl, and to the north of Ain Girgâwi. The best occurrences\r\nare to the south of the Gorn el Gennâh, in which district the\r\nferruginous waters of certain wells have deposited thick banks of\r\nochre along their channels.\r\n\r\nThe sulphates of aluminium and magnesium are widely distributed\r\nin the oasis, though the deposits are seldom of sufficient extent\r\nto repay extraction. They occur as thin bands in the shales and\r\nsandstones of the surface-water series, seldom exceeding a few\r\ncentimetres in thickness, and being generally of very limited\r\nhorizontal extent. The alum, which is often found in beautiful\r\nfibrous or hair-like crystalline masses, is frequently of a delicate\r\nrose tint, and analysis shows the colour to be due to the presence\r\nof small quantities of cobalt. Epsomite (Epsom salts or hydrous\r\nsulphate of magnesia) is also found in fibrous crystalline seams,\r\na remarkably pure deposit, containing several hundred tons, having\r\nbeen quite recently located a few kilometres west of Headquarters.\r\n\r\nIn the foot-hills to the north of Bellaida, at the base of the\r\neastern slopes of Jebel Tarif, and in the hills immediately to the\r\nwest of Qasr Lebekha, ancient mines of the most extensive description\r\nare to be seen. The rocks in these localities consist of variegated\r\nsandstones and grits, many of the beds being so dark and ferruginous\r\nthat the hills, as a whole, have a blackened and almost volcanic\r\nappearance. They are literally honeycombed with ancient workings,\r\nmany of which, both in the form of large chambers and narrow tunnels,\r\npenetrate for long distances underground. Huge dump-heaps mark\r\nthe entrances of the workings, and bear witness to the enormous\r\nquantities of ‘country’ rock removed in the winning of the\r\nuseful mineral. The rude shelters built by the miners are to be\r\nseen in the immediate vicinity, and in many cases are still intact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WADI IN JEBEL TARIF.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RIVER OF SAND NEAR UM EL DABADIB.]\r\n\r\nThe extent and magnitude of the underground workings prove that\r\nwhatever the mineral mined, it was a substance of considerable value\r\nin those days; and an examination of the blind terminations of the\r\ntunnels occasionally reveals the presence of very thin seams of\r\naluminium sulphate, which, in the absence of indications of other\r\nuseful minerals, we must conclude was the substance sought. The\r\nbands of alum were evidently followed until they thinned out to a\r\nfraction of an inch, or disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nA reference to the geological sequence will show the stratigraphical\r\nposition of the phosphatic series of the oasis, consisting of\r\nhard bands composed of fish-remains, coprolites, and phosphatic\r\nnodules. The beds have a wide extension in Northern Kharga, and are\r\nespecially well developed on the flanks of Jebel Tarwan and Jebel\r\nTêr, in the centre of the depression. As a rule, they consist of\r\nan upper brown-coloured series, individual beds of which in places\r\nhave a thickness of 2 or 3 metres, and a lower division consisting\r\nof three or four thin, hard, and lighter-coloured bands, in which\r\nthe phosphatic nodules are often cemented by iron pyrites. The\r\nupper bands may contain anything up to 60 per cent. of tricalcium\r\nphosphate, so that the deposit may be regarded as of considerable\r\npotential value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                SOME NOTES ON SPORT AND NATURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Libyan Desert as a Sporting Region — The Dorcas Gazelle —\r\nSnipe — Wild-Fowl — The Local Sportsmen — An all-night Sitting\r\n— Quail — Sand-Grouse — Rock-Pigeons — Turtle-Doves —\r\nVarious — Striped Hyæna — Jackals — Three Species of Fox\r\n— The Desert Fox — The True Fennec.\r\n\r\n\r\nSportsmen who reckon the success and pleasures of a shooting\r\nexpedition only by the contents of the resulting bag are advised to\r\ngive a wide berth to the Libyan Desert, as in that arid region—with\r\nthe exception of one restricted area far removed from the oasis under\r\ndescription—no game is to be found which cannot be obtained far\r\nmore easily, and in much greater quantities, in the cultivated plains\r\nof the Nile Valley and on the adjoining desert margins. On the other\r\nhand, the sportsman who does not regard too seriously the actual\r\nhead of game brought to bag, and who has no objection to hard work,\r\nwill find in the oases undoubted attractions in the way of rough\r\nsport. Provided with a few camels to carry the necessary impedimenta,\r\nso as to be rendered independent and able to wander about at will,\r\na very enjoyable time can be spent exploring the various isolated\r\nportions of the depression where gazelles abound, and visiting the\r\nnumerous outlying wells where wild-fowl, snipe, quail, sand-grouse,\r\nand rock-pigeons are to be met with in fair quantities.\r\n\r\nThe little Dorcas gazelle ranges over the whole of the Libyan\r\nDesert. On the plateau, owing to the extreme scarcity and scantiness\r\nof vegetation, gazelles seldom remain in the same locality for any\r\nlength of time, and even when met with can rarely be approached,\r\nowing to the open nature of the country. In the more fertile\r\noases-depressions they are to be seen in far greater numbers,\r\nespecially in the outlying portions where large tracts are covered\r\nwith coarse grasses, tamarisk, and other kinds of scrub. After\r\nnightfall they frequently descend to the cultivated lands to browse\r\non the crops, almost invariably retiring to the outlying desert\r\nareas at the first traces of dawn, though I recollect on one occasion\r\nbringing a laggard to bag very early in the morning on the edge of\r\na barley-field at Um el Dabâdib. Gazelles are, in fact, seldom to\r\nbe seen, unless carefully sought for in their special haunts; one\r\nmight remain for months in the inhabited portions of the depression\r\nand only be aware of their existence from occasionally meeting with\r\ntheir spoor.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable when hunting gazelles to pitch camp at some distance\r\nfrom their grazing grounds, as they are extremely wary, and not\r\nto be approached once they have taken alarm. Extensive tracts\r\nof uninhabited, scrub-covered desert, like those to the north of\r\nAin el Qasr, affording ample supplies of food, and undisturbed by\r\nman, are the favourite haunts of these extremely shy animals. For\r\nshooting this district an excellent camping-ground will be found on\r\nthe edge of the scrub in the neighbourhood of Qasr Gyb, an ancient\r\nruin conspicuously perched on the summit of a conical hillock,\r\nabout 20 kilometres north of Meheriq. The dead parts of the scrub\r\nsupply an abundance of fuel, and good water is obtainable by\r\nclearing out a section of the ancient underground aqueduct lying a\r\nshort distance to the south. From the shelter of any of the higher\r\nclumps of vegetation one can, with the aid of field-glasses, keep a\r\ncareful look-out over the surrounding scrub-covered country, and,\r\nonce gazelles have been located, getting within range is merely a\r\nmatter of patience and careful stalking. After sighting the quarry,\r\nit is best to proceed alone, as natives have an exasperating way of\r\nexposing themselves at the most critical moments. On my last visit\r\nto the north of the oasis there were a good many gazelles about,\r\nincluding a herd of some seven or eight; it was, however, quite\r\nimpossible to get within 500 yards of these, but I had better luck\r\nwith a solitary couple a few kilometres to the north of the old ruin,\r\nboth of which I succeeded in bagging.\r\n\r\nThe Dorcas gazelle is one of the smallest and fleetest of the\r\nantelopes. When full grown, the buck stands about 22 inches high\r\nat the shoulder, the horns in my best head—not, however, shot in\r\nKharga—measuring exactly 13 inches. Properly cooked, its flesh\r\nis excellent, and certainly superior to the average Egyptian mutton.\r\n\r\nFor snipe the best time is from December to February, though I\r\nhave shot odd birds as early as October and as late as April. Both\r\nthe full and the jack snipe are to be met with, their favourite\r\nfeeding-grounds being the rice-stubbles immediately after the crops\r\nhave been harvested, and before the ground has had time to get hard\r\nand dry. In the cold weather, however, almost any wet patch—and\r\nthere are numerous small bogs at the lower ends of the paddy-fields\r\nand alongside leaky irrigation channels—will yield one or two\r\ncouple. Formerly there was a very useful bit of ground at Ain el\r\nTawîl, but the best place of all is close to the village of Gennâh,\r\nwhere a reedy bog of considerable size at times positively swarms\r\nwith snipe. This place is rather difficult to shoot, and I used to\r\nconsider I had done well if four or five couple were gathered.\r\n\r\nPools of various size, formed by drainage waters from the cultivated\r\nlands, are found scattered throughout the oasis, and in the early\r\nmorning or late evening hours quite a respectable bag of wild-fowl\r\ncan sometimes, with a little luck, be secured. I say sometimes\r\nadvisedly, as where duck are concerned one has to compete with\r\nthe local sportsmen, whose name is legion. Mallard, teal, and\r\nshoveller ducks are the most common, though several of the other\r\nspecies commonly found in the Nile Valley are also to be met with\r\nin the oasis.\r\n\r\nThe keenness of the Kharga sportsmen is well illustrated by the\r\nfollowing incident: Encamped on one occasion for a week or two near\r\nthe village, I was in the habit of pottering about of an evening with\r\nmy gun, visiting the two or three pools within easy walking distance\r\nof the tents; but although there were a good many wild-fowl about,\r\nthese had been worried to such an extent that they only remained\r\non the ponds during the darkest hours of the night, preferring,\r\nindeed, to pass the day in solitude in the open desert than to\r\nturn themselves into targets for the never-ending practice of the\r\nlocal Nimrods. Thinking to get the better of both duck and natives,\r\nI made arrangements to visit a pool about three miles distant from\r\nthe village, starting at an hour early enough to enable me to take\r\nup a good stand before daybreak. Fortified by biscuits and hot cocoa,\r\nI and my faithful retainer, Mohammed Abu Salem, left camp one chilly\r\nmorning about three, riding the best part of the way on camels,\r\nover the roughest country imaginable. Half a mile from the pool we\r\ndismounted, and I proceeded alone on foot across cultivated lands,\r\non which, to my astonishment, ploughing was already in progress,\r\nthough it was still dark, wanting a full hour to dawn. Slowly\r\nand with some difficulty I made my way towards the thin streak\r\nof light that I knew marked the position of the pool, which in my\r\nmind’s eye I already pictured as covered with duck. Presently,\r\nto my surprise and disgust, a shot rang out; but this was nothing\r\nto my astonishment a few moments later, when, just as I was getting\r\nup to the water, a regular broadside was discharged. There seemed\r\nto be gunners all over the place, and my only concern now was\r\nto get out of their way as speedily as possible; so, ensconcing\r\nmyself behind a small sand-hill, I lighted a pipe and awaited\r\nfurther developments. By careful manœuvring I was able to watch in\r\nmoderate safety the glassy surface of the pond, and did not have to\r\nwait long before I heard a rattle of wings, followed by the swoop\r\non to the water. No sooner had the birds alighted than they were\r\ngreeted with a fusillade from all sides of the pool, after which\r\nsilence once more reigned supreme. This performance was repeated\r\nevery time duck or coot made their appearance, and few escaped the\r\neffects of the deadly cross-fire to which they were subjected.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight appeared I counted over a dozen gunners squatting\r\nround the pond, although the latter measured no more than 120 to\r\n130 yards across its widest part. They were armed with every sort\r\nof weapon, from the latest thing in cheap European breech-loaders\r\nto the most antiquated form of flint-lock, the barrel of the latter\r\ntype of gun being usually of great length, and not unlike a piece of\r\ngas-pipe. As soon as daylight was sufficiently advanced, the natives\r\nproceeded to gather the slain, the bulk of the bag being made up of\r\ncoots, which at night have a habit of deserting the depths of the\r\nrice-fields for a swim and change of food on the open pools. Each\r\nman seized the birds he considered had fallen to his gun, and I\r\nwas struck by the small amount of squabbling which took place over\r\nthe division of the spoil, most of the bickering having reference\r\nto complaints of being peppered, though the wonder was that no one\r\nhad been killed, or even seriously hurt. As soon as everything was\r\nsatisfactorily adjusted the majority of the men, having salaamed\r\nand expressed surprise at my presence, made off towards the village,\r\nonly a few of the keener spirits remaining on the chance of further\r\nsport. To my delight, a flight of duck shortly afterwards put in\r\nan appearance, and I was able to score by bagging a couple as they\r\npassed suspiciously over the pond. The laugh was now on my side,\r\nas I need hardly say that the native never risks wasting his powder\r\nand shot on birds on the wing, and after some mutual banter they\r\ndeparted, leaving me in possession of the field.\r\n\r\nQuantities of quail pass through the oasis on their annual migration\r\nfrom north to south and on their return journey in the opposite\r\ndirection. The best bags can be made in the spring, when the corn\r\nis commencing to ripen, but sport is usually rendered difficult\r\nowing to the number of natives at work in the fields. The local\r\nsportsmen do not seem to consider quail worthy of their attention,\r\nprobably because the birds so seldom show themselves except when on\r\nthe wing. A good many are, however, secured by the peasants in traps.\r\n\r\nSand-grouse are to be met with in many parts of the depression, more\r\nespecially near the outlying sparsely cultivated spots, the commonest\r\nvariety found being one of the pin-tailed species. The sandy country\r\nround Gennâh is perhaps the best district. Rock-pigeons frequent the\r\ncultivated lands of Bellaida, to the north of the village of Kharga,\r\nand have their homes in the rocky fastnesses of Jebel Têr and Jebel\r\nTarif, breeding in perfect security in the fissures which traverse\r\nthe limestone rocks of those hills. Turtle-doves are found in the\r\nmore wooded portions of the oasis, their favourite haunts being\r\nthe old spreading acacias which line the water-channels and mark\r\nthe sources of the ancient wells. Although not as a rule regarded\r\nas coming into the category of game-birds, turtle-doves are by no\r\nmeans to be despised when one has failed to replenish the larder from\r\nordinary sources. When disturbed in their favourite haunts, the birds\r\nfly rapidly from tree to tree, and shooting has to be both straight\r\nand quick if anything of a bag is to be made. In addition to these\r\nan occasional plover or water-hen may be met with and be considered\r\nas worthy of record in the ‘various’ column of the game diary.\r\n\r\nIn the Nile Valley the striped hyæna has often afforded me a day’s\r\namusement if not actual sport, but this animal is certainly not a\r\nresident in the oasis, though on rare occasions an individual crosses\r\nthe plateau and remains for a few days within the depression. Jackals\r\nare common, though not nearly so numerous as in the neighbouring\r\noasis of Dakhla. At night they prowl about the outskirts of the\r\nvillages, and the din that a single couple can make must be heard\r\nto be believed. The cry is most weird, consisting of a succession\r\nof long melancholy wails, each one a little higher pitched than the\r\npreceding, followed finally by a quick succession of sharp yelps\r\nor barks.\r\n\r\nOf foxes there appear to be three species in Egypt, the largest\r\nand best known being a variety of the common fox (_Canis vulpes_,\r\nsubsp. _ægyptiaca_). Although this animal frequently makes its\r\nhome on the margins of the bordering deserts, it is never found\r\nat any great distance from the villages of the Nile Valley, to\r\nwhich it invariably descends at dusk, returning to its lair in the\r\nearly morning after spending the night roaming the cultivated\r\nlands in search of food. The smaller desert fox, or fennec\r\n(_Canis famelicus_), is found not only on the desert margins, but\r\nthroughout the interior plateaux and depressions. A true denizen\r\nof the desert, this animal seldom approaches the abodes of man,\r\nand probably never penetrates into the cultivated lands on either\r\nside of the Nile. Thirdly, there is the diminutive little fox, the\r\ntrue fennec (_Canis zerda_), which, although found throughout the\r\ninterior of the Libyan Desert tableland, is especially abundant in\r\nthe oases-depressions.\r\n\r\nOf this beautiful species the late Dr. Anderson, in his ‘Zoology\r\nof Egypt,’ wrote: “There is no authentic record of the Fennec\r\nhaving been discovered in a wild state by any European traveller. All\r\nthe specimens which have been brought home have been obtained from\r\nArabs.” This fox is, it is true, a very shy animal, so much so\r\nthat during the course of many years’ work in almost every part\r\nof the Libyan Desert I never had the good fortune to observe one in\r\nits natural haunts, though its burrows were often met with, and my\r\nmen at night occasionally succeeded in securing specimens in traps.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year or two, however, while resident in Kharga\r\nOasis, I have been more fortunate, having frequently observed\r\nthese interesting little animals sitting near the entrances\r\nto their burrows or sniffing about in search of food on areas\r\nsparsely dotted with desert vegetation. Several pairs had burrows\r\nwithin a few kilometres of my headquarters, and were, I believe,\r\nresponsible for fowls that disappeared from time to time from our\r\nfarm-yard. Mr. P. von Adametz kept one of these tiny foxes in the\r\nmess for some time, but this particular animal, which had been\r\ncaught in the neighbourhood of Meheriq, was evidently too old to\r\nbecome tame. Fennecs probably subsist mainly on desert gerbils and\r\njerboas, which are always to be found in large numbers in those\r\nportions of the desert where vegetation is at all plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LITERATURE ON THE OASIS OF KHARGA\r\n\r\n\r\n  PONCET, M.\r\n    1709. “A Voyage to Æthiopia, made in the Years 1698, 1699, and\r\n           1700.” (Translated from the French.)

F. Hume, in a discussion of the formation\r\nof the oases-depressions, refers to the importance of soft and hard\r\nstrata, and to the action of folding in exposing the former to the\r\nagents of denudation. This is striking confirmation of the views\r\npromulgated by me since my first acquaintance with the oases many\r\nyears ago. Of great interest and value, being new, is the suggestion\r\nthat the topography of the southern oases and surrounding desert\r\nmay be, to a considerable extent, due to denudation acting on the\r\ncountry as it was in process of being elevated from the sea in\r\nwhich the deposits forming it had been laid down.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The dates given in this chapter are those assigned by\r\nProfessor Steindorff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Canon Rawlinson’s translation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: That even occasional rains can effect a considerable\r\namount of erosion of soft materials is shown by the present state\r\nof these domes, from which a skin of some thickness has been washed\r\naway, leaving the surfaces bristling with the sharp fragments of\r\nrock which were included in the original mixture of sand and clay\r\nfrom which the bricks were manufactured.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The royal cubit was the chief unit of length, and\r\nmeasured 20·6 inches; 300 and 500 cubits would therefore be\r\nequivalent to 515 and 858 feet respectively.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Headquarters of the Corporation of Western Egypt,\r\nLimited (see map).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: I should like to record my indebtedness to Mr. Garsed,\r\nwho, while in the oasis, undertook, at my request, a considerable\r\namount of special analytical work, in addition to his regular\r\nduties.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: ‘The Nile Flood and Rains of the Nile Basin,\r\n1906,’ Survey Department, Cairo, 1907; ‘Some Geographical\r\nAspects of the Nile,’ the _Geographical Journal_, November, 1908,\r\nvol. xxxii., No. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: ‘The Dead Heart of Australia’; John Murray,\r\nLondon, 1906.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: ‘The Hydraulic Aspect of the Artesian Problem,’\r\nProceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, vol. xxxvii.,\r\np. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: ‘Egyptian Irrigation,’ second edition, E. and\r\nF.
