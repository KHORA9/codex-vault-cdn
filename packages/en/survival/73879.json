It is based on surveys which I carried out by order of the\r\nEgyptian Government during the four years 1905-1908, and has been\r\nwritten in the intervals of other official work during the succeeding\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nIn the first or introductory chapter, I have given a summary, with some\r\ncriticisms, of previous accounts of the region. This seemed advisable\r\nin that the literature, although not very extensive, is scattered in\r\nbooks and papers in various languages, and is not always easy of access.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter is a concise systematic account of the district,\r\ndesigned mainly as a summary for those who do not wish to go into the\r\ndetails; it also contains sections dealing with matters of insufficient\r\nimportance, or of which our knowledge is too scanty, to be treated of\r\nspecially in the succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter is an account of the surveying methods employed and\r\nthe principal geographical results obtained. The surveying methods are\r\ntreated at some length, firstly because an adequate specification of\r\nthe survey methods used is necessary for the assessment of the value\r\nof any contribution to modern geography, and, secondly, because some\r\nof the methods are either new or little known, and have been found\r\nby experience to be specially adapted to the mapping of this type\r\nof country. The principal geographical results are given, mostly in\r\ntabular form, as exhibiting clearly the groundwork of the actual maps,\r\nand as indicating a series of adequately fixed positions which may be\r\nemployed as a basis in any further surveys.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth to sixth chapters the drainage lines and hill features\r\nare systematically described. A knowledge of the drainage lines, as the\r\nkey to a precise understanding of the relief, is nowhere more important\r\nthan in these deserts.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh chapter the important question of water supplies is\r\nconsidered, and the positions and particulars of the various water\r\nsources are tabulated for easy reference.\r\n\r\nThe eighth to tenth chapters deal with the various rocks occurring\r\nin the district. The petrology of the region has been discussed with\r\nsome fulness, because while the district offers a remarkable wealth of\r\nrock-species, well exposed in considerable masses, detailed studies\r\nof Egyptian petrology have hitherto been few. My great regret in this\r\nconnexion is that I have been unable to add chemical analyses of the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh chapter summarises the general geological structure and\r\nhistory of the region, as gathered from a broader outlook over the\r\ndetailed geological evidences.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth chapter I have set down the information I was able to\r\nobtain regarding the territorial limits of the different Bedouin tribes\r\ninhabiting the region.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth and concluding chapter of the book consists of brief\r\nnotes taken on the return march to Port Sudan.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the cartographic material, most of which is new, special\r\nattention has been given to the place-names, and it is believed\r\nthat these are correct in almost every case. But as the names are\r\nin languages not understood by European draughtsmen, it is almost\r\nimpossible that mistakes have been entirely avoided; in any case where\r\nmap and text may disagree in spelling (the differences will, I trust,\r\nnever be so great as to leave doubts of identity), the text should be\r\nfollowed in preference to the map, as mistakes in the text are usually\r\nmore easily perceived and corrected. I would remark that although the\r\nwhole of the field maps have been employed in preparing the small scale\r\nones, yet the full detail can be recorded only on the large scale maps,\r\nwhich are given for the most important districts; a future explorer\r\nwould do well, therefore, to refer to the manuscript field maps which\r\nare filed at the Survey Office at Gîza, before concluding that no more\r\ndetailed survey exists than is shown on the maps in this book.\r\n\r\nThe plates illustrating the scenic types are from my own photographs,\r\nwhile those illustrating the natural-size aspect of the typical rocks\r\nare reproductions from water-colour drawings which I made from actual\r\nspecimens. These coloured plates of rocks are mainly designed to enable\r\nprospectors to identify readily the ordinary kinds of stone they meet\r\nwith in the field; but they will also serve to give to petrologists an\r\nidea of the appearance of hand specimens of rocks from this part of\r\nthe world, which are not frequently met with in the great museums. The\r\ntext figures of rock sections I have mostly drawn at the microscope on\r\nsilver prints from photographic plates, the prints being afterwards\r\nbleached out with mercuric chloride; they will appear slightly\r\ndiagrammatic in places, owing to the necessity of using lines and dots\r\nfor tints, but I find I myself get a better idea of a rock from a\r\ndrawing of this kind than from a photograph.\r\n\r\nMuch detailed surveying of this mountainous and arid region remains yet\r\nto be done, especially in the districts round the heads of the Wadi\r\nAlaqi, before our knowledge of it can be considered complete. It is\r\nhoped, however, that a substantial beginning has been made towards this\r\nend, and that future work may be facilitated by the observational data\r\nrecorded in the following pages.\r\n\r\n                                                            JOHN BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER    I. — Introduction                                         1\r\n\r\n     „      II. — General Description of South-Eastern Egypt          18\r\n\r\n     „     III. — Surveying Methods and Principal Geographical\r\n                  Results                                             39\r\n\r\n     „      IV. — The Wadis draining Westwards to the Nile            78\r\n\r\n     „       V. — The Wadis draining Eastwards to the Sea             94\r\n\r\n     „      VI. — The Mountains and Hills                            164\r\n\r\n     „     VII. — Water Supplies                                     234\r\n\r\n     „    VIII. — Geology.—Sedimentary Rocks                         251\r\n\r\n     „      IX. — Igneous Rocks                                      262\r\n\r\n     „       X. — Metamorphic Rocks                                  331\r\n\r\n     „      XI. — Tectonics and General Geology                      354\r\n\r\n     „     XII. — Tribal Boundaries                                  366\r\n\r\n     „    XIII. — Notes on the Road from Halaib to Port\r\n                  Sudan                                              372\r\n\r\n  INDEX                                                              379\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LIST OF PLATES.\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n     Plate.

The shaded area shows the\r\ndistrict treated of in this book.]\r\n\r\nThe district treated of in this volume constitutes the extreme\r\nsouth-east corner of Egypt, lying between the parallels of 22° and\r\n25° of north latitude, and between the meridian of 34° E. and\r\nthe Red Sea coast. It comprises an area of about 56,000 square\r\nkilometres, and includes some of the most mountainous and least\r\naccessible portions of the Khedive’s dominions.\r\n\r\nThe district has been comparatively little visited by travellers, and\r\nthe literature concerning it is not very extensive. Berenice (_Jh_)[1]\r\nwas founded by Ptolemy II (285-247 B.C.), who named the town after his\r\nmother, as a station at one end of the road for transporting goods\r\nfrom the Red Sea to the Nile at Koptos (Quft). The emerald mines in\r\nthe Zabara area were worked at least as early as Ptolemaic times,\r\nand gold mines in the south at a much earlier date.\r\n\r\nReferences to this part of Egypt occur in the writings of STRABO,\r\nDIODORUS SICULUS, and PLINY, as well as in PTOLEMY’s Geography and\r\nthe ANTONINE ITINERARY. Both Strabo and Pliny state that in Berenice,\r\nas in Syene, the sun cast no shadow at the summer solstice from\r\nwhich they inferred the town to be on the tropic of Cancer, though\r\nin reality it lay in their day some twenty-five kilometres, and is\r\nnow about 28′, or some fifty-two kilometres, north of the tropic,\r\nthe difference being caused by the secular change in the obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic since the beginning of the Christian era. Ptolemy gives\r\nthe latitude of Berenice as 23° 50′, which is only 5′ too low;\r\nthe _Smaragdus mons_, or emerald mountain, he places in latitude 25°,\r\nwhich is about 15′ higher than the true position of Gebel Zabara\r\n(_Ec_). Diodorus gives a very clear description of the working of\r\ngold mines in the Eastern Desert in his day, by miserable convict\r\nlabour. The road from Koptos to Berenice is mentioned, with lists of\r\nstations and water reservoirs and their distances from each other,\r\nboth by Pliny and the writer of the Antonine Itinerary; and though\r\nPliny gives fewer stations than the Itinerary, the two accounts agree\r\nvery closely in estimating the total distance at about 258 Roman\r\nmiles, which, so far as can be judged from a partial identification\r\nof the stations marking the route, is pretty correct. The island\r\nof Zeberged (_Ok_), on which occurs the green gem called peridot,\r\nis probably the _Topazos Insula_ of Diodorus, and the _Agathon_ of\r\nPtolemy; but Diodorus gives its length as eighty stades (about twelve\r\nkilometres), which is three times greater than its present size, and\r\nPtolemy’s latitude of 23½° is some 16′ too low. Ptolemy states\r\nthat the coast was inhabited by the _Ichthyophages_, or fish-eaters,\r\nwhile the _Troglodytes_, or cave-dwellers, of Strabo, were probably\r\nthe workers in the mines.\r\n\r\nThe books of the Arab geographers, EDRISI and ABU EL FEDA, contain\r\nsome references to the roads and mines of the Eastern Desert, but\r\ntheir descriptions are unimportant and contain frequent palpable\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\nD’ANVILLE, in his _Mémoires sur l’Egypte_, Paris, 1766,\r\npp. 230-235, attempted to construct a map of the coast of the Red Sea\r\nby combining the classical records with some early Portuguese and\r\nother charts, but the latter were too crude to enable any approach\r\nto be made to an accurate map.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that BRUCE discovered the island of Zeberged\r\nand the emerald mines of Zabara in 1769, but it is tolerably certain\r\nthat he saw neither of these places. He estimated the latitude of the\r\nisland he saw “pretty exactly” as 25° 3′, and its distance from\r\nthe coast as three miles,[2] whereas Zeberged is really in latitude\r\n23° 36′, and is over thirty miles from the nearest coast. The\r\nmines he saw were so close to the coast that he could walk to them\r\nfrom his boat and back in less than a day (in fact he states that\r\nthey were only three miles from the coast), while both the Sikait\r\nand the Zabara mines are over a day’s journey from the sea. Nor\r\ncould the mines have been the sulphur workings near El Ranga (_He_),\r\nunless Bruce made a large error in his observation for latitude, for\r\nthe sulphur mines are about in latitude 24° 25′, and, moreover,\r\nBruce states that he found “brittle green crystals,” not sulphur.\r\n\r\nIt is to the French traveller CAILLIAUD[3] that we owe the first\r\nmodern account of Berenice and the emerald mines. Cailliaud was a\r\nmineralogist, in favour with Mohammad Ali Pasha, who sent him on\r\ntwo expeditions in 1816 and 1817 to search for mines in the Eastern\r\nDesert. On his first expedition, starting from Redesia (near Edfu),\r\nhe discovered the rock temple of Seti I, forty-five kilometres\r\neast of the Nile, and several ancient stations on his route, and\r\nproceeded to the emerald mines of Zabara and the sulphur mines of\r\nEl Ranga. On his second expedition he took with him sixty Albanian\r\nworkmen to exploit the mines, and led them by nearly his former\r\nroute to Zabara, where they extracted ten lbs. weight of emeralds\r\n(beryls) for presentation to the Pasha. On this second expedition\r\nCailliaud discovered the mines and ruins of Sikait, and also other\r\nruins in the Wadi Nugrus (_Ed_). Cailliaud’s drawings of the ruins\r\nof Sikait greatly exaggerate their size and elegance.\r\n\r\nJOMARD, in notes prefaced to Cailliaud’s account of his travels,\r\nmade a careful study of the probable positions of the ancient roads\r\nand mines in this part of Egypt; he thought that Wadi Gemal Island\r\n(_Hd_) was Zeberged.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, BELZONI,[4] fired by Cailliaud’s discoveries, set out\r\nto discover the ancient Berenice. Starting from Edfu, he travelled\r\neastward for some days over Cailliaud’s route, then marched _via_\r\nBir Samut (where he discovered the ancient station) and Wadi Ghuel\r\nto the Zabara mines, where he found Cailliaud’s miners still at\r\nwork. From Zabara he journeyed through the Wadi Sikait, passing the\r\nmines and ruined temples which had been discovered by Cailliaud,\r\nand down the Wadi Gemal to the sea. Proceeding then southward\r\nalong the coast, he examined the sulphur mines at El Ranga near\r\nthe mouth of the Wadi Abu Ghusun, and then made his discovery of\r\nthe ruins of the temple and town of Berenice, near the peninsula of\r\n“Cape Galahen” (Ras Benas). The ruins were so inconspicuous as\r\nto be only found with difficulty, and the temple was so buried in\r\nsand that Belzoni could only make a very imperfect plan of it. The\r\nancient town he estimates to have covered a space near the temple\r\n1,600 feet broad and 2,000 feet long. Leaving Berenice the same\r\nday on which he made his discovery, Belzoni returned to Sikait by\r\nway of Abu Greia, Haratreit (where he discovered ancient stations),\r\nHefeiri well, and the spring of Um Sueh. After copying some Greek\r\ninscriptions at Sikait, he returned to Edfu by way of Wadis Hafafit\r\n(_Dc_), where he found an ancient station, Abu Had, and Samut.\r\n\r\nBelzoni’s map[5] of his routes is of course very crude and\r\nerroneous, but the fact that he gives the names of the places he\r\npassed enables one to reconstruct his routes on modern maps with fair\r\nexactitude. His drawings of the ruins he visited are fairly accurate,\r\nthat of the rock temple of Sikait being a much truer picture than\r\nCailliaud’s.\r\n\r\nThe extreme south-east corner of Egypt was first explored in 1831\r\nand 1832 by LINANT DE BELLEFONDS, who twenty years later published an\r\ninteresting account of his travels and discoveries.[6] The manner in\r\nwhich Linant Bey’s expedition arose is very curious. He had read\r\nthe accounts of Diodorus and Arabic writers concerning the ancient\r\ngold mines of the Eastern Desert, and when he accidentally discovered\r\nsmall crystals of gold in quartzose detritus brought down the Wadi\r\nAlaqi into the Nile by a storm torrent, he at once inferred that\r\nthis wadi would lead him to the mines. The Arabs told him, quite\r\ncorrectly, that the down-wash had its origin far up the wadi, nine\r\ndays’ journey from its mouth. Reporting his discovery to Mohammad\r\nAli Pasha, that prince commissioned him to lead an expedition to\r\nsearch for the mines. Starting from Aswan, Linant journeyed south-east\r\nand discovered the ancient mines and ruins at Gebel Seiga (_Bp_), and\r\nsubsequently the more extensive workings at various places round the\r\nhead of Wadi Alaqi, such as Egat (_Ft_) and Darahib (_Gu_). From the\r\nAlaqi district he proceeded northward to Bir Shinai (_Hr_), and thence\r\neastwards round the spurs of the mountains to Bir Meisah (_Kr_),\r\neast of which he discovered the old mines of Romit (_Ls_). Crossing\r\nthe great Wadi Di-ib, he appears to have reached Bir Akwamtra (_Os_),\r\nat the foot of Gebel Elba. His desire to explore the mysterious Elba\r\nmountains was frustrated by the Arabs, and he only ascended a minor\r\npeak before commencing his return march. From Elba he returned _via_\r\nBir Meisah, Bir Beida (_Ho_), and the Wadis Khashab (_Gn_), Hodein,\r\nRod el Kharuf (_Ch_), and Kharit to Daraw on the Nile, discovering\r\nthe springs of Abu Saafa (_Em_) in the course of his march.\r\n\r\nLinant thus performed for the south portion of the district a similar\r\nservice to that which his compatriot Cailliaud had already done for\r\nthe north portion. His remarks on the people of the country, their\r\nmanners and customs, are no less interesting than his descriptions of\r\nthe ruins and mines which he discovered. The notes on certain points,\r\nsuch as the manner of trapping the wild ass which then roamed these\r\ndeserts, are specially interesting as illustrating past usages. Linant\r\nalso compiled a small Bisharin-French vocabulary as an appendix to\r\nhis work. The large map accompanying his book, though it is well\r\nengraved and depicts well the general mountainous character of the\r\ncountry, is unfortunately full of large errors; Gebel Is (_Jt_), for\r\nexample, is placed more than sixty kilometres too far south; while\r\nmany of the place-names are either wholly incorrect or so loosely\r\ntransliterated as to be almost unrecognisable. But with all its\r\ndefects, Linant’s map remained the only source for cartographers\r\nfor a large portion of the Eastern Desert down to the time of the\r\ncommencement of the present survey; the map of Egypt published in\r\n1905 by the Topographical Section of the British General Staff, for\r\ninstance, contains much of Linant’s material, though a comparison\r\nof that map with the one joined to this report will show how great\r\nwere the errors in the matter thus incorporated.\r\n\r\nWILKINSON[7] gives very brief notes on Berenice and the ancient roads\r\nleading to it, as well as on the emerald mines of Zabara and the\r\nruins of the Sikait district. Wilkinson believed he had identified\r\nall the ancient stations on the Koptos-Berenice road, besides another\r\nsmaller one not mentioned in classical itineraries. In the temple\r\nof Berenice he found a small fountain, which is now in the British\r\nMuseum. But his work added little to what had already been learned\r\nby Cailliaud and Belzoni regarding this part of Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, WELLSTED,[8] a lieutenant in the Indian Navy, who had been\r\nemployed in surveying the Red Sea coast, described the topography\r\nof Berenice, and assigned to the place its true latitude of 23°\r\n55′. He gives a plan and view of the temple, which he partially\r\ncleared, and in which he found fragments of Greek tablets and of\r\na statue.\r\n\r\nBetween 1830 and 1840 important contributions were furnished to the\r\ngeography of Eastern Egypt by the surveys of the Red Sea, carried out\r\nby MORESBY, WELLSTED, and other officers of the East India Company’s\r\nNavy. Their sailing directions formed the foundation of the “Red Sea\r\nand Gulf of Aden Pilot,” now published by the British Admiralty.[9]\r\nBoth the charts and sailing directions have been continually revised\r\nby Admiralty surveys, and furnish much accurate information about the\r\ncoast. The principal errors are that almost the entire coast-line\r\nbetween latitudes 22° and 25° is placed too far to the west,[10]\r\nand some of the place-names are wrong, or at least unknown to the\r\nlocal sailors of to-day. Such details of the inland relief as are\r\ngiven on the charts are not correct, as was of course to be expected\r\nin a hydrographic survey; but the main summits are fairly accurately\r\nlaid down, and their altitudes agree well with my determinations. Thus\r\nthe “Southern peak” of the chart, in latitude 23° 18′, is\r\nGebel Fereyid;[11] the “Black conical hill,” near Mersa Shab,\r\nis Gemeida; “Scragged hill” is Qash Amir;[12] “High peak”\r\nis Gebel Elba; “Castle hill” is Gebel Shendodai; and “South\r\npeak” is Asotriba, the highest mountain of the Elba group.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, BARTH made a journey from Aswân to Berenice and thence\r\nto Qoseir, and subsequently published a brief journal of his\r\nexpedition.[13] Going eastward from Aswân, he passed north of\r\nGebel Hamrat Mukbud (_Cf_), _via_ the Wadi Khashab, past the tomb of\r\nSheikh Shadli (_Df_) and the granite boss of Selaia (_Fh_), which\r\nhe thought to be of slate, and then descended to the coast by Wadi\r\nSalib Abiad and Wadi Khoda (_Hf_). He discovered the old station\r\n(now called Garia Kalalat) south-west of Berenice, on his way to the\r\ntemple, of which he took measures. Barth remarks on the insignificant\r\nnature of the ruins and on the badness of the site for a town. On his\r\nreturn journey, he discovered the wells and ruins of Shenshef (_Jj_),\r\nwhere there are well preserved remains of substantial dwellings which\r\nhe thought denoted a settlement by people from Berenice. Ascending\r\nthe Wadi Shut after returning to Wadi Khoda, he turned westward and\r\nreached the plain south of the Abu Hamamid-Hamata mountains. Crossing\r\nthis mountain track by the difficult pass of Hilgit, he descended\r\nthe Wadi Huluz (_Ef_), into Wadi Gemal, whence he turned northward\r\nand visited the ruins of Sikait. From Sikait he proceeded by winding\r\ntracks past Bir Ghadir (_Ec_) and on to Qoseir.\r\n\r\nThe next traveller to visit the district, VON HEUGLIN, examined\r\nthe country from the coast.[14] Sailing southward from Qoseir,\r\nhe discovered ruins which he thought to be those of Ptolemy’s\r\n_Nechesia_, in latitude 24° 55′, a little south of Ras\r\nTundeba. Further south, he enumerates the various openings and\r\nanchorages of the coast to Suakin. Gebel Hamata (_Gf_) he wrongly\r\nthought might be the Alaqi of the ancient mining records. His\r\n“Wadi el Hemmah” is doubtless Wadi Lahami (_Hg_). Rounding\r\nRas Benas, he passed the coral island of Mukawar (Geziret el Ras),\r\nand anchored by the ruins of Berenice, which he states to be called\r\nSikait Qibli.[15] In and near the temple ruins von Heuglin found\r\ncopper nails, fragments of statues, Roman coins, a quartz sistrum and\r\npieces of beryl, besides potsherds and broken glass. Passing Mersa\r\nShab (Sherm Hel el Madfa), he notes a few fishermen’s dwellings on\r\nSeyal Island, and a pearl fisher from Jidda plying his calling at\r\na small anchorage called Gota, near Ras Fatma. He mentions Kwolala\r\nas “Geziret Elba,” close to the “peninsula of Halaib” (now\r\nan island, Geziret Halaib).[16] The Elba mountains he states to be\r\nthe _Prionotus mons_ of Ptolemy. The “Sherm Qubeten,” which he\r\nnotes to the south of Halaib, is doubtless Mersa Qabatit of my map.\r\n\r\nIt is to the veteran African traveller SCHWEINFURTH that we owe\r\nthe first investigations of the Elba mountains, as long surrounded\r\nwith mystery as the stronghold of dreaded Bisharin tribes.[17]\r\nLike von Heuglin, Schweinfurth visited the country from the\r\ncoast, making excursions inland. Starting from Qoseir in March,\r\n1864, he proceeded with frequent stoppages to Suakin, spending\r\nnearly six months in exploring the littoral districts. His chief\r\nobject was the investigation of the flora of the country, but his\r\naccounts[18] contain much geographical and geological information\r\nof great interest. He compares the coastal ranges of Africa with\r\nthe Cordilleras of South America, and the Abyssinian highlands with\r\nQuito. The flora of the Elba district he found to be sharply marked\r\noff from that of the rest of Egypt by the presence of large numbers\r\nof plants of Abyssinian types. Among his geological notes, it is\r\ninteresting to come across a reference to serpentine, which I have\r\nlately found to form the great mountain masses of Abu Dahr (_Gk_),\r\nKorabkansi (_Fq_), and Gerf (_Hp_). Schweinfurth wrote, however, in\r\nthe early days of petrography, and his term “basalts” includes a\r\nvariety of fine-grained dark eruptive rocks which we should now call\r\nby other names. The sulphur mines of El Ranga he characterised as\r\nworthless, the mineral being in very small quantity. Schweinfurth’s\r\nmap of the Elba district was a great advance on anything of the\r\nkind previously existing, though it contains many inaccuracies,\r\nparticularly of place-names, as was in fact only to be expected from\r\nhis very short stay in the locality. He remarked the separation\r\nof Gebel Elba (_Pr_) from the more southern mountains, but failed\r\nto notice that Qash Amir (_Os_), (the “Scragged Hill” of the\r\nAdmiralty Chart), is in its turn quite distinct from Elba, Halaib\r\nis called Elei,[19] and the Geziret Halaib is shown as a peninsula;\r\nKwolala is called “Geziret Elei,” and the Geziret el Dibia\r\n(the Elba Island of the charts) is called Geziret Abu Fendira by\r\nSchweinfurth. My Wadi Shellal he calls “Wadi Heberah,” and Cape\r\nElba (my Ras Hadarba) is noted as “Ras Edineb.” His “highest\r\npeak” (South Peak of the charts) is Asotriba, the highest mountain\r\nof the group, lying just within the Sudan; the name Asotriba\r\n(Schweinfurth’s “Soturba”) means “green mountain,” and\r\nrefers to the vegetation on its slopes. Schweinfurth’s experience\r\nof the Bisharin led him to give them a very bad character, though\r\nhe gives high recognition to their beauty of feature and figure;\r\nbut being unfamiliar with their language was, he admits, an obstacle\r\nto forming a fair judgment of them.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, Colonels PURDY and COLSTON, two American officers attached\r\nto the Egyptian Army, were commissioned by the Khedive Ismail Pasha\r\nto carry out a reconnaissance for a proposed railway line between\r\nBerenice and Berber. Colston[20] travelled overland from Qena _via_\r\nQoseir to Berenice, discovering several ancient stations on his\r\nway to join Purdy. Though Purdy sanguinely states[21] that “la\r\nconstruction d’un chemin de fer de ce point (Berenice) à Berber\r\nn’offrirait pas de grandes difficultés,” the reconnaissance\r\nappears to have been singularly rough for a decision in so weighty a\r\nmatter. Distances were mere guesses, and the only instruments employed\r\nseem to have been a compass, aneroid, and hypsometer. The compass\r\nmust often have been unreliable owing to magnetic rocks, which in\r\nplaces deflect the needle as much as 40° from its normal position,\r\nwhile the use of the aneroid was so little understood that Purdy\r\ncould actually write, in the concluding paragraph of his paper: “Je\r\nme permets de rappeler l’attention sur les notes barométriques\r\njointes à ce rapport. A ce propos, je dois faire observer que\r\nquoique l’anéroïde soit très sensible aux changements de\r\nniveau, il ne l’est pas assez pour la pression atmosphérique,\r\net sa marche est excessivement irrégulière. . . . Il m’est\r\narrivé, par exemple, de constater, le matin, au moment du départ,\r\nune différence sensible du point marqué le soir précédent à\r\nmon arrivée.” Not only are many of the place-names given by Purdy\r\nerroneous, but some of his most important statements are contrary to\r\nfact; to take only a few examples, the Wadi Kalalat is confused with\r\nWadi Shenshef, and Gebel Shut with Gebel Dahanib, while it is stated\r\nthat no water exists between Gebel Dif (_Fm_) and Gebel Egat (_Ft_),\r\nalthough there are several good wells between the two places. The\r\nmap accompanying Purdy’s paper is full of errors, and almost\r\nworse than useless. Of Colston’s route from Qena to Berenice there\r\nwas no published cartographic record until 1891, when G. CORA[22]\r\nendeavoured to place Colston’s track on a map from his manuscript\r\nsketches. Cora’s map shows no new material except the route, and\r\neven this cannot be very correct, for it is evident on comparison\r\nwith the results of the recent survey that Colston’s sketch map\r\nwas of the same rough and inaccurate character as Purdy’s.\r\n\r\nIn January 1889, GOLÉNISCHEFF made an expedition from the Nile\r\nto Berenice and back. His object was to collect archæological\r\ninformation, especially concerning the ancient roads and stations, but\r\nthe careful account[23] which he has given of his journey is also of\r\ngeographical interest. Starting from Redesia by Cailliaud’s route,\r\nhe examined the temple of Seti I, and then discovered the ancient\r\nstation of Abu Medrik[24] further to the south-east. Passing the\r\nruins at Samut and Dweig (_Cc_), he found another small station on\r\nthe way to Abu Had, and arrived at the station in Wadi Gemal (_Ed_),\r\nnear Wadi Hafafit. From the Wadi Gemal he proceeded _via_ the Wadis\r\nAbiad (_Fe_), Abu Hegilig, Hefeiri, Abu Ghusun (_Ge_), Haratreit\r\n(_Hf_), Khashir (in which another ancient station was discovered),\r\nand Lahami (_Hg_), past the Abu Greia ruins, to Berenice. He returned\r\nby way of Wadis Naait (_Hh_) and Lahami on to the plain of Kharit,\r\nand thence past Hamrat Mukbud (_Cf_), _via_ the Wadis Khashab, Kharit\r\n(_Ag_), and Abu Modellim, to the Nile. Golénischeff, besides giving\r\nsmall plans of the various ancient stations and a carefully measured\r\nplan of the temple of Berenice, made a comparison of his itinerary\r\nwith the descriptions of the old roads by classical writers and\r\nby Colston. He considers there can be no doubt that Abu Greia is\r\nthe _Vetus hydreuma_ of Pliny, and the ruins in Wadi Khashir the\r\n_Novum hydreuma_ of the same writer. The ruins in Wadi Haratreit he\r\nconsiders to be the station _Cabalsi_ of the Antonine Itinerary,\r\n_Apollonus_ being identified with the well found by Colston at\r\nHefeiri, _Falacro_ with the ruins in the Wadi Gemal, and _Aristonis_\r\nwith those in Wadi Dweig.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, FLOYER, at the head of a scientific exploring expedition sent\r\nout by the Khedive Tewfik Pasha, travelled over the country north of\r\n23° 30′, and his results were published in French in 1893.[25] A\r\nlittle later, the geographical results of the expedition were embodied\r\nin an English paper read at the Royal Geographical Society.[26] The\r\ngeneral map in the French essay is only on a very small scale, but the\r\nEnglish publication is accompanied by a much more illuminating map on\r\na scale of 1:760,320, reduced from one prepared by the Intelligence\r\nDivision of the War Office from Floyer’s original plane-table\r\nsketches. This latter map, in spite of many errors and defects, was a\r\nvery great advance on anything which had previously appeared, and it\r\nformed the principal source of geographical information concerning the\r\nnorth part of the district at the commencement of my survey in 1905.\r\n\r\nThe geological observations made by Floyer during his expedition\r\nformed the subject of a paper read by him before the Geological\r\nSociety of London in 1892.[27] This paper is chiefly remarkable for\r\nthe number of grave errors of observation into which Floyer’s\r\nlimited acquaintance with geology caused him to fall, and later\r\nresearches have fully justified the scepticism with which his\r\ndeductions were received by the Society. Thus, for instance, he refers\r\nto the ancient schists and slates of Zabara as “blue clay,”[28]\r\nand to the dark schists and diorite of Abu Hamamid and Abu Gurdi\r\nas “compact granite.” The rocks which Floyer considered to be\r\n“metamorphosed sandstone” are diorites and schists at Um Eleiga\r\nand in the Wadi Gemal, and typical gneisses and granites in the Nugrus\r\nand Hafafit ranges. Not a trace of sandstone has been found to exist\r\nwithin many miles of the places where Floyer records its metamorphism,\r\nnor has any evidence of the recent volcanic activity reported by him\r\n(_Geog. Journal_, 1893, p. 430) been discovered.\r\n\r\nAn account of a short visit to the Elba district was published\r\nby BENT[29] in 1896. Bent landed at Halaib and camped near Gebel\r\nShellal (_Qt_). He thinks that Halaib may have been the town of\r\n_Aydat_ mentioned by the Arab geographers Abu el Feda and Edrisi,\r\nand that it is a place of purely Arab origin. At Suakin el Qadim\r\n(_Qs_) he found among the mounds nothing earlier than Cufic remains,\r\nunless certain graves, formed of four large blocks of coral set\r\ndeep in the ground, may be looked upon as a more ancient form of\r\nsepulture. His “Gebel Shendeh” should be correctly Gebel Shendib,\r\nand his “Shendoeh” is correctly Shendodai; the “Riadh”\r\nmentioned by him I have not been able to identify. His estimated\r\nheights are considerably in error; thus Gebel Shendib is really\r\n6,273 feet and Gebel Shellal 4,623 feet instead of the 4,500 feet and\r\n4,100 feet which he gives. The paper contains interesting remarks on\r\nthe Hamedorab tribe, which Bent was informed totalled only some 300\r\nfighting men in the entire district from Asotriba to Ras Benas. The\r\nreference to the sheikh as “the batran” is due to a misconception;\r\nBatran was the late sheikh’s first name, and is not a title of\r\nstation. The map accompanying Bent’s paper is only to a very small\r\nscale, and formed practically no addition to existing knowledge.\r\n\r\nMACALISTER[30] has given a detailed and interesting account of the\r\nSikait district (_Ed_), with special reference to its geology, as\r\nthe result of an expedition there in 1899. The small scale sketch\r\nmap of the route followed in reaching the mines from the valley is\r\nnot very correct, but the detail maps of the Sikait neighbourhood\r\ngive an accurate representation of the area in which the mines\r\nare situated, while the geological notes give an excellent idea\r\nof one of the most highly metamorphic areas of the entire Eastern\r\nDesert. Macalister gives some notes also on the ruins and the people\r\nof the neighbourhood. His experience of the Ababda as workers was very\r\nunfavourable; though his characterisation is unfortunately only too\r\nwell merited by a large section of the tribe, it is probable that a\r\nlonger acquaintance with Arabs would have enabled him to select men of\r\na better class. A sufficiency of good men for a caravan of 130 camels\r\ncannot be raised without great expenditure of time and care, even by\r\nthose who have lived for many years among the Arabs, and a few bad\r\ncharacters in a desert camp soon exert a bad influence over the rest.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant series of investigations carried out by the officers\r\naccompanying the Austrian research ship “POLA” in the Red Sea in\r\nthe winter of 1895-96, though chiefly concerned with oceanographic\r\nquestions, contain not a few observations of interest connected with\r\nthe land.[31] The positions determined include Sherm Sheikh, Berenice,\r\nSt. John’s or Zeberged Island, and Halaib. The latitudes observed\r\nagree well with the values which I found by triangulation.[32]\r\nFor longitude the method used was the transport of chronometers,\r\nand this method is liable to such considerable errors that we\r\nneed have no hesitation in preferring my triangulation values,\r\nespecially as our latitudes are in agreement. The observations\r\nmade by the officers of the “Pola” on the compass-variation at\r\nBerenice and Halaib are of considerable importance as enabling us,\r\nby comparison with my own observations at the same places, eleven\r\nand twelve years later, to obtain a reliable value for the rate of\r\nsecular change of this magnetic element in the district. A large\r\nscale map of Halaib is given, and amongst other observations of\r\ninterest to the geographer in South-Eastern Egypt are analyses of\r\nthe water at Halaib, a series of pendulum observations which show\r\na decided increase in the force of gravity over the sea as compared\r\nwith the intensity over the land, and descriptions with figures of\r\nsome of the reptiles which are found in the region.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the work of the GEOLOGICAL SURVEY in the district,\r\nthe maps and descriptions in the present volume are the result of\r\nsurveys carried out by me in the three seasons 1905-1908, or about\r\ntwenty-two months’ work in all. The survey was commenced primarily\r\nwith the view of enabling mining concessions to be accurately marked\r\nout. How little possibility of this existed so recently as 1902 may\r\nbe gathered from the fact that although a ministerial order of that\r\nyear had defined the administrative frontier between Egypt and the\r\nSudan as being a line joining certain important mountains and wells,\r\nwhich were named, yet it was impossible to lay this frontier down\r\ncorrectly on a map because the geographical positions even of these\r\nimportant features were uncertain to many kilometres.\r\n\r\nThe main interest in the field methods used, which will be described\r\nin detail in a subsequent chapter, lies in the fact that many of\r\nthem are wholly or in part new, having been devised as the work\r\nproceeded to meet the special exigencies of the case. The costly\r\nnature of camel-transport, and the relatively small value of\r\nthe country, precluded the employment of the ordinary sequence of\r\nsurvey operations, and it was necessary to carry on reconnaissance,\r\nprecise triangulation, detailed topographical mapping, and geological\r\nsurveying, all at once, and to move rapidly so as to cover a large\r\narea in a moderate time. Starting from a measured base near Gebel\r\nMuelih, which had been previously connected by triangulation with\r\nthe Nile Valley, a network of large triangles was thrown over\r\nthe country. The essential feature of the triangulation was the\r\nemployment of observations at relatively few occupied main summits,\r\nto fix large numbers of points by intersection; in some cases over\r\na hundred triangulation points were sighted from a single occupied\r\nstation. The triangulation was continued so as to join to a second\r\nbase line near Gebel Um Harba (_Ck_), and was also connected on to\r\nmain points in the trigonometrical survey of the Sudan, thus linking\r\nup a continuous chain of triangles from Alexandria to Berber. The\r\ntotal number of main (occupied) stations was sixty-four, while the\r\nintersected points numbered 450. In addition to these, about 1,200\r\nminor points were fixed by subsidiary triangulation from short\r\nlocal bases.\r\n\r\nLevels were taken trigonometrically for all points fixed by\r\ntriangulation, using the actual sea-level as the datum. The altitudes\r\nof nearly all camps were likewise found trigonometrically, and\r\nbetween successive camps aneroid readings, adjusted to the initial\r\nand terminal points of the day’s march, were employed to supplement\r\ntrigonometrical determinations made on the journey.\r\n\r\nFor the control of the maps, latitudes and azimuths were taken at\r\nintervals, the former by equal altitudes of three or more stars,\r\nthe latter by elongations of close circumpolar stars.\r\n\r\nThe topographical sketching, carried out on plane-tables on a scale\r\nof 1:100,000, was based on the points triangulated, these being\r\ncomputed in camp and plotted by their geographical coordinates\r\nas much ahead of the lines of march as possible. When marching,\r\nplane-table stations were fixed by re-section from three or more\r\ntriangulated points, the compass being useless owing to abundance\r\nof magnetic rocks. Details along the line of march were put in by\r\ntacheometric readings from the stations, using specially devised\r\nlong distance methods. But the greater portion of the sketching was\r\ndone from the mountain tops while occupying them as trigonometrical\r\nstations, and for this again special methods, involving an extensive\r\nuse of vertical angles, were employed. On an average, about thirty\r\nsquare kilometres were sketched in during each day’s march, and\r\nabout 400 square kilometres from each main trigonometrical station,\r\nwhere it was usually necessary to remain for at least a week to get\r\nsufficiently clear weather for the more distant sights. It was not,\r\nof course, possible to sketch every portion of the area in uniform\r\ndetail, for some parts lay so far from the line of march and from\r\nthe triangulation stations that little or no detail was visible. The\r\nlacunæ were filled in as far as possible in the field from guides’\r\nstatements, taking care on the field maps to distinguish parts so\r\nfilled as only approximate. A few additions near the west limit\r\nof the map have been added from reconnaissance surveys by various\r\ncolleagues of the Survey Department. For details of the upper part of\r\nthe basin of the Wadi Alaqi, I have taken advantage of an admirable\r\nreconnaissance-survey of this tract recently made by Mr. J. MORROW\r\nCAMPBELL, B.SC., F.R.G.S., for the Egyptian Options, Ltd., who\r\nkindly placed their map at the disposal of the Government. My\r\ntriangulation gave the positions and altitudes of all the principal\r\npeaks of this region, and thus enabled Mr. Campbell’s map to\r\nbe accurately adjusted to the Survey positions, and his drainage\r\nlines and other topographical details have been inserted with great\r\nadvantage to the map, which would otherwise have been almost blank in\r\nthis particular area. Mr. Campbell’s map does not, unfortunately,\r\ngive any altitudes, and the only altitude data for the orographical\r\nsketching were the peaks and other points of connexion with the Survey\r\nmap; but by taking into account the depth of shading of the different\r\nhill masses and the known altitudes determined by triangulation,\r\nit is believed that a fairly approximate picture of the orography\r\nhas been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe sea coast north of latitude 24° 10′ was adapted from the\r\nAdmiralty Chart, fitting it on to coast points trigonometrically\r\nfixed. South of 24° 10′ the coast was surveyed in detail by means\r\nof depression angles from the occupied peaks of the triangulation. The\r\nlocal circumstances, in the existence of high mountains pretty\r\nclose to the sea, are so favourable to the employment of this\r\nmethod, that it is confidently believed that the maps represent\r\na considerable advance in accuracy over the Admiralty Charts. It\r\nwas frequently possible to check the accuracy of the coast-line\r\ndelineation by plane-table rays, and it was invariably found that\r\nthe errors were insensible, even on the fairly large scale employed\r\nin the field-maps. The coast-line shown is the high water-line. The\r\ntidal change of level, though it is generally less than a metre,\r\nuncovers in many places extensive coral reefs at low water, but no\r\nattempt was made to map these.\r\n\r\nVery special care was taken with place-names, which are transliterated\r\non the Egyptian Government system. It may be remarked that this system\r\nis based on the Arabic _spelling_, not on pronunciation. Thus, in this\r\npart of the country, the letter _g_ is almost always soft, like an\r\nEnglish _j_, and the _q_ is always sounded like a hard _g_. The same\r\nsystem was used for the Bishari and Ababda names, these being first\r\nwritten by a guide in Arabic characters and then transliterated. It\r\nis believed that the orthography is correct in almost all cases.\r\n\r\nThe geology was examined along every line of march, and additional\r\nspecimens were obtained by sending guides to collect rocks from\r\nmountains otherwise unvisited. Where possible, the principal\r\ngeological boundaries were drawn direct on the plane-table sheets in\r\nthe field, and the remainder have been placed from field notes. The\r\nlimits of the different igneous and metamorphic rocks shown on\r\nthe geological map aim only at showing general relationships,\r\nfor in many cases it is difficult, owing to insensible gradations,\r\nto decide exactly where granites and diorites end and gneisses and\r\nschists begin, while in other places rocks of two or three distinct\r\nspecies are so intimately mixed that the boundaries could not be\r\nshown on the small scale used, even if the exact limits were traced\r\nby a life-time’s work; in these latter cases the areas are coloured\r\nin accordance with what appeared to be the dominant rock within them.\r\n\r\nThroughout the three seasons’ work I was accompanied by Dahab\r\nEffendi Hassan, who rendered useful assistance in booking angles and\r\nin reconnaissance, and in the third season Mr. O. N. Bakewell also\r\naccompanied me and gave me much useful help. The Egyptian unskilled\r\nstaff employed consisted almost entirely of Bedouin and comprised on\r\nan average about twenty-five camel drivers (for thiry-five baggage\r\ncamels), six porters, three guides, and two postmen, all placed\r\nunder an Arab sheikh.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of the field-work was approximately L.E. 5,090, or\r\nabout 150 milliemes for each square kilometre of country mapped\r\nin detail. Nearly two-thirds of the entire amount were expended\r\nin camel-transport, the remainder representing the expenditure on\r\nsalaries and allowances of the author and assistants engaged in\r\nactual surveying operations.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The references in parentheses after place-names refer\r\nto their positions on the map, Plate I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Bruce’s Travels to discover the Sources of the Nile._\r\nHalifax, 1845. pp. 78-80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: CAILLIAUD, _Travels in the Oasis of Thebes and in the\r\nDeserts east and west of the Thebaid_, edited by JOMARD.

It\r\ncomprises an area of about 56,000 square kilometres (22,000 square\r\nmiles).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Relief.[33]=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe higher mountains of the Eastern Desert generally form the\r\nwatershed between the Nile and the Red Sea. This watershed is much\r\nnearer to the coast than to the Nile, with the result that the\r\neastward drainage is much steeper than to the west.\r\n\r\nCommencing from the north (_see_ the orographical map, Plate I),\r\nthe principal mountain masses are:—\r\n\r\n(i) The Migif — Hafafit — Nugrus — Hangalia — Zabara group\r\n(1,505 metres[34]), cut off to the south by the Wadi Gemal (_Fd_).\r\n\r\n(ii) The Abu Hamamid — Hamata — Abu Gurdi group (1,978 metres),\r\nlimited on the south by the Wadi Lahami (_Hg_).\r\n\r\n(iii) The Um Gunud — Dahanib — Batoga group (1,270 metres), lying\r\nbetween Wadi Lahami on the north and Wadi Khoda (_Hj_) on the south.\r\n\r\n(iv) The Abu Dahr — Orga — Um Tenedba group (1,131 metres),\r\nseparating the drainage of Wadi Betan (_Fl_) from Wadis Khoda and\r\nRahaba (_Hl_).\r\n\r\n(v) The Faraid group, the _Mons Pentadactylus_ of Ptolemy, comprising\r\nsome very remarkable granite peaks (1,366 metres), lying near the\r\ncoast between Wadi Khoda and Wadi Rahaba.\r\n\r\n(vi) The Awamtib — Abraq — Dif — Aqab el Negum — Mishbih\r\ngroup (1,353 metres), forming the tripartite watershed between the\r\ngreat Wadi systems of Kharit and Alaqi on the west, and that of Wadi\r\nHodein on the east.\r\n\r\n(vii) The Gerf — Abu Hodeid group, a mighty mass rising to 1,736\r\nmetres, lying between Wadi Hodein (_Jn_) and Wadi Hasium (_Hs_).\r\n\r\n(viii) The Meisah — Adar Qaqa — Is group, between the Wadis\r\nHasium and Di-ib (_Mr_).\r\n\r\n(ix) The Elba — Shendib group (1,912 metres[35]), a great mass of\r\nspiky mountains lying near the sea between Wadi Di-ib and the coast.\r\n\r\nBesides these main groups, there are numerous more or less isolated\r\nmountains, of which Gebels Abu Khrug (_Bd_, 870 metres), Hamrat\r\nMukbud (_Cf_, 890 metres), Zergat Naam (_Ej_, 845 metres), and the\r\ntwo Niqrubs (_Fn_ and _Fo_, 829 metres and 1,078 metres) are examples.\r\n\r\nSome of the mountains, especially the granite “bodkin” of Gebel\r\nFaraid (_Hl_), and some of the peaks of the Elba group, appear to\r\nbe unclimbable. A few others are rather dangerous of ascent, as,\r\nfor example, Gebel Abu Hamamid (_Ef_) on account of its steepness,\r\nand Gebel Abu Dahr (_Gk_) by reason of combined steepness and rotten\r\nrock, which comes away in tons at a touch. The highest peak of all\r\nwithin the district, Gebel Hamata (_Gf_), is a comparatively easy\r\nclimb from the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Hydrography.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of the main watershed which parts the Red Sea and Nile\r\ndrainages is highly irregular both in altitude and direction, as will\r\nbe evident from the orographical map (Plate I), on which it is shown\r\nby a red line. From Gebel Hamrat Wogud, in the north, it passes east\r\nof Gebel Atut, thence through the high masses of Gebels Hangalia,\r\nNugrus, Hafafit, and Migif, beyond which it drops southward through\r\nthe low country round Gebel Abu Had. Entering the mountains again\r\nat Gebel Nukheira, it takes an eastward bend, passing along the\r\ngreat ridges of Gebels Abu Hamamid, Um Usher, Um Hasidok, and Ras el\r\nKharit. Striking southward across the head of Wadi Kharit, it courses\r\nthrough the mountains of Mikbi and Abu Gurdi, thence dropping to the\r\nsouth on the plain near the hills called Marwot Elemikan. Turning here\r\nsharply westward over the plain, it passes through the hill-mass of\r\nGebel Abu Derega and on to Gebel Zergat Naam, south-west of which it\r\ncrosses the low tract at the head of Wadi el Arned to the sandstone\r\nplateaux of Dagalai, whence it courses a little to the west of\r\nGebel Um Reit and enters the mountainous tract of Gebel Aqab el\r\nNegum. Its further course has not been traced in detail, but from\r\nguides’ statements and the indications of the main drainage-lines\r\nit is believed to run as shown on the map, in a great curve through\r\nthe two sharp peaks of Gebel Sheyenit to the west of Gebel Mishbih,\r\nand then in another flatter curve south-eastwards to Gebel Soaorib,\r\nat the head of Wadi Hasium. Continuing along the mountain ridges of\r\nGebel Soaorib, it crosses to Gebel Is,[36] separating the Wadi Is\r\nfrom the heads of Wadi Alaqi on the Sudan frontier.\r\n\r\nThe watershed is for a great part of its course quite impassable for\r\ncamels. The principal places where it can be crossed are at the head\r\nof Wadi Nugrus, near Abu Had, the Wadi Marasan between Huluz and\r\nWadi el Sheikh, the heads of Wadi Lahami, Wadi el Fil, Wadi Arned,\r\nand Wadi Um Reit, passes at Aqab el Negum and Hamrat el Feg, near\r\nGebel Mishbih, the head of Wadi Hasium, and the pass of Adar Ameit,\r\nnorth of Gebel Is. All these places are practicable for baggage\r\ncamels, though in some of them, as, for instance, at the head of\r\nWadi Nugrus, care is required because the track is steep and stony.\r\n\r\nThe principal drainage-basins are shown on the small scale map\r\non Plate II. The westward drainage ultimately reaches the Nile by\r\nthe three main trunk wadis of Shait, Kharit, and Alaqi; Shait and\r\nKharit enter the Nile Valley at Kom Ombo, while Alaqi debouches near\r\nDakka. The eastward drainage is much more complex, the principal\r\ntrunk wadis, such as Um Khariga, Gemal, Khoda, Rahaba, Hodein, Ibib,\r\nDi-ib, and Serimtai, being separated by very numerous minor wadis\r\ndraining independently to the sea.[37]\r\n\r\nNearly all the wadis contain vegetation in the form of trees and\r\nbushes, and plant life flourishes as a rule far more luxuriously in\r\nwadis draining seawards than in those leading to the Nile. Feqoh,\r\nNaam, and the lower reaches of Hodein are, however, exceptionally\r\nbarren. Forming, as they do, the only possible roads, furnishing\r\nthe entire supply of camel food, and containing most of the wells,\r\nthe wadis are to the desert what the Nile is to Egypt proper. The\r\nintervening mountains are of no interest to the Arabs, except when\r\nthey contain water-reservoirs. Hence the place-naming starts from\r\nthe wadis, even the smallest of which have names unless they are\r\nbarren. Mountains are generally named after the nearest wadi, and may\r\nthus have two names when situated between two wadis, the particular\r\nname used depending on which side the mountain is seen from.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Coast-line.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coast-line of this part of Egypt is somewhat irregular, the\r\npeninsula of Ras Benas forming a prominent projection in latitude\r\n24°. In the south part of the area the eastward extension of the\r\ncountry, culminating in Ras Hadarba (Cape Elba of existing maps),\r\nis very marked, extending nearly to 37° of east longitude. The\r\ncoast is almost entirely fringed by coral reefs, passage through\r\nwhich is only possible at certain points, and then only with the\r\nutmost care in navigation.[38] Between the feet of the mountains and\r\nthe sea there extends a gently sloping plain, varying in width from\r\nabout eight to twenty-five kilometres, covered with sand, over which\r\nthe drainage meanders in shallow courses, often only traceable by\r\nthe vegetation which occurs along them. A rather surprising result\r\nbrought out by the levelling observations is that the slope of the\r\ncoast plain, even where it looks flattest and sandiest, is as steep\r\nas the floors of some of the wadis draining on to it, and several\r\ntimes more steep than the beds of the wadis which drain westwards\r\nto the Nile, its fall seawards averaging six metres per kilometre\r\nand reaching over ten metres per kilometre in some sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Climate.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of the district is predominantly hot and dry to the\r\nwest of the watershed, hot and moist eastward of it; but very cold\r\nweather is apt to prevail for a few weeks in January and February,\r\nwith strong north winds, on both sides of the watershed, and the\r\ntransition from piercing cold to great heat at these times is often\r\nbrought about very suddenly by a change of wind direction. There\r\nis seldom any frost, but water-bags are occasionally frozen on the\r\nmountain tops at night. Cool north-west winds prevail in the north\r\npart of the area, while hot damp winds from the south-east are usual\r\nin the south. In the central part, round Berenice, absolute calms are\r\nfrequent.[39] The highest mountain-masses are frequently swathed in\r\nclouds for weeks together, especially from January to March. The hot,\r\ndry, sand-laden winds called _Khamsin_ occasionally blow for four\r\nor five days together in March and April; at these times the shade\r\ntemperature rises to over 45° C., and the air is thick with sand and\r\ndust. Rain falls in most years, but its quantity is very variable;\r\nin some years there is barely enough to keep the wells supplied, and\r\nmuch of the vegetation withers; in others, heavy storms produce wild\r\ndownrushes in the wadis, filling them for short periods with raging\r\ntorrents. Curious electrical and optical phenomena can sometimes be\r\nseen on the mountain-tops during storms and in mists.[40] The Elba\r\nregion is seldom free from clouds, and receives far more rain than\r\nany other portion of the area, forming in fact the northern limit of\r\nthe rainy tropical zone; it is in consequence relatively well wooded,\r\nwhile the other mountains are a dreary waste of naked rocks.\r\n\r\n                                                             PLATE II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH-MAP OF SOUTH-EASTERN EGYPT.\r\nShowing Drainage-Basins.\r\n\r\nBall. Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Metal-Process. Survey Dept. Cairo 1910. (60-190)\r\n\r\nScale 1:2,000,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Scenery.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe predominant types of scenery are extensive sandy plains and\r\ngaunt rugged mountains. In the low-lands, pleasant relief from\r\nthe stony monotony is afforded by the trees and scrub which occur\r\nalong most of the wadis, though their struggle for existence is\r\noften evidenced by miles of withered and blackened scrub in places\r\nwhich a few years ago were green and flourishing. The bareness\r\nof the mountains becomes slightly relieved in the Elba district,\r\nwhere beautiful trees and flowering plants thrive high up the\r\nmountain-side along all the drainage lines. As to the forms of\r\nthe mountains, one sees extensive broken sandstone plateaux at\r\nGebel Abraq (_El_), remarkable rounded granite bosses at Gebels\r\nMuelih (_Ab_), Nugrus (_Dc_), Selaia (_Fh_), and Um Rasein (_Jr_),\r\njagged and spiky granite peaks in the mountains of Faraid (_Jk_),\r\nQash Amir (_Os_), and Elba (_Ps_), and broken masses of gneiss,\r\ndark schists and serpentines at Gebels Hafafit (_Dc_), Hangalia\r\n(_Dc_), Abu Hamamid (_Ef_), Hamata (_Gf_), and Gerf (_Hp_). Perhaps\r\nthe most remarkable of all the peaks are those of Faraid (_Jk_),\r\nwhich from the north look like the expanded fingers of a huge hand,\r\nwhence they received their name of _Mons Pentadactylus_ in antiquity,\r\nwhile one specially sharp peak is styled very appropriately “the\r\nBodkin” on Admiralty Charts. The mass of Elba forms a very fine\r\nview from the north, but the prevalence of clouds about its summits\r\nfrequently hides it from view for months together. The views from the\r\nmountain-tops are extensive and beautiful, especially at sunrise and\r\nsunset, when the peaks take on wonderful colours, and the views from\r\nthe summits when the entire lower landscape is bathed in clouds,\r\nthrough which only the higher peaks project like islands from\r\na great sea, are not less remarkable. Though a good look out was\r\nkept from the highest mountains across the sea, the mountains of\r\nthe opposite shore of Arabia were never with certainty made out;\r\nthe cone of Zeberged Island was, however, often seen. It is stated\r\nby d’Anville, on the authority of Castro,[41] that both the Arabian\r\nand African mountains can be seen from the summit of Zeberged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =Animal and Plant Life.=\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth animal and plant life is mainly confined to the drainage\r\nlines. Of wild animals suitable for human food, gazelles can be\r\nshot fairly frequently in the south part of the area, but are very\r\nscarce in the north. Sand grouse and partridges can occasionally\r\nbe obtained round Abu Saafa, while doves are very abundant in the\r\ngroves near Bir Akwamtra, at the foot of Gebel Elba. Ibex were never\r\nseen with certainty, though their horns and lairs were often found\r\non the mountains. Conies inhabit the rocks near Bir Abraq and Bir\r\nMadi. The wild ass has disappeared from the area, as also has the\r\nostrich, though fragments of ostrich eggs picked up here and there,\r\nand drawings of this bird on the rocks, attest its presence here in\r\nrecent times. Vultures, kites, and ravens are everywhere in evidence,\r\nand several kinds of smaller birds, such as swallows and wagtails,\r\nare often seen about the greener wadis. Lizards of many kinds are to\r\nbe seen. Scorpions and snakes are seldom met with. Of butterflies\r\nand moths, especially the latter, many varieties occur. The common\r\nfly occurs in such numbers as to be a great pest, but mosquitoes and\r\nsand-flies are practically absent. Camel ticks infest the ground\r\nunder all trees used as shade by travelling Arabs. Earwigs are in\r\nsome places very abundant, and a great variety of beetles and bugs\r\noccur. Near the sea, whole armies of crabs are to be seen marching\r\non the shore, and hermit crabs are very numerous in all sorts of\r\ngasteropod dwellings.\r\n\r\nOf plant life the district contains a great variety. The north and\r\ncentral parts of the area contain the same trees and bushes as abound\r\nfurther north in Egypt,[42] and camel food is moderately abundant. As\r\nElba is approached, many beautiful flowering plants not found further\r\nnorth are met with, while in the clefts of the slopes of Elba itself\r\nis a far richer vegetation than occurs wild in any other part of\r\nEgypt. I found the approach to Elba was stopped for baggage camels\r\nsome four kilometres from the summit owing to the closeness of the\r\ntrees, and the ascent on foot up the clefts of the mountain-face\r\nfor the remainder of the way was more like going through an English\r\nwood than up a desert mountain. Many varieties of sweet-smelling\r\nflowers and some fruit-bearing trees unfamiliar in Egypt were seen,\r\nwhile mosses and lichens covered the tumbled masses of granite in\r\nmany places. Schweinfurth, who examined the botany of this region\r\nin 1864, found that of 300 species of plants collected in the Elba\r\ndistrict, the vast majority were of Abyssinian types; scarcely 100\r\nwere living in other more northerly parts of the Eastern Desert of\r\nEgypt, while still fewer are indigenous to the Nile Valley, and only\r\nfifteen species were of those found wild in Europe.[43]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Water Supplies.[44]=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sources of water comprise _galts_ (rock basins forming rain\r\nwater reservoirs in the mountains), springs and wells. Of these,\r\n_galts_ yield the purest water, and form the principal supply of the\r\npastoral Arabs, except in years of no rainfall, while springs and\r\nwells, the latter usually rude excavations in the alluvia of wadis,\r\nare most used by travellers from their easier accessibility. Small\r\n_galts_ are called _megal_ (Ababda) or _megwel_ (Bisharin); they\r\nare frequently accompanied by small springs.\r\n\r\nThe small scale map on Plate III, which shows all sources known\r\nto exist within the area, gives a good idea of the distribution of\r\nwater supplies. Water is scarce in the western parts of the country,\r\nBir Abu Hashim being the only source within a radius of about sixty\r\nkilometres of itself, but _galts_ and wells are fairly frequent among\r\nthe mountainous tracts further east. The springs of Abraq and Abu\r\nSaafa are the most important sources in the central area. The portion\r\nof the country under the Sudan Administration is far richer in water\r\nthat the Egyptian part, containing numerous fine wells and springs,\r\nsuch as Birs Meneiga, Abu Hodeid, Akwamtra, and Frukit. The coast\r\nplain is waterless, except for salty wells near the sea.\r\n\r\nWater can usually be obtained at intervals of about two or three\r\ndays when on the march, and in some parts much more frequently. The\r\nwater of certain wells and springs has a purgative effect due to\r\nthe absorption of magnesium salts, especially after a long interval\r\nwithout rain. That of others, again, such as Muelih and Shalatein,\r\nis so salty as to be only drinkable by camels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Geology.[45]=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks composing this part of Egypt are principally igneous and\r\nmetamorphic deposits of very ancient origin. Granite is most prominent\r\nin the Nugrus, Faraid, and Elba areas, schists and diorites cover a\r\nlarge portion of the remaining country, and huge masses of serpentines\r\nform the mountains of Abu Dahr, Korabkansi, and Gerf. Of sedimentary\r\nrocks, plateaux of Nubian sandstone (Cretaceous) cover large areas\r\nround Bir Abraq and westward of it, while a narrow belt of the\r\nsame rock also occurs along the sea coast in the north part of the\r\ndistrict. Gypseous limestones (Miocene?) form the hills of Ras Benas\r\nand occur along the coast north of Wadi Lahami, as well as in small\r\nareas near the coast further south in the neighbourhood of Halaib.\r\n\r\n                                                            PLATE III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH-MAP OF SOUTH-EASTERN EGYPT.\r\nShowing the Water-sources and the Roads connecting them.\r\n\r\nBall.

(60-190)\r\n\r\nScale 1:2,000,000.]\r\n\r\nCrushing of the older rocks is almost everywhere strongly evidenced,\r\nbut faulting is difficult to trace except in the sandstone areas,\r\nwhere it is strongly marked. The presence of clearly defined\r\noverthrust faulting in the Abraq area shows that tangential earth\r\nmovements, so rare in this part of the world,[46] have not been\r\naltogether absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Mineral Products.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mineral resources of this part of Egypt are not of very great\r\nimportance, owing partly to its inaccessible situation and desert\r\ncharacter. Gold and copper ores occur in places; other localities\r\ncontain beryl and peridots, while others, again, bear iron ores,\r\ngypsum, sulphur, steatite, asbestos, and magnesite, and good building\r\nstones abound over large areas.\r\n\r\nThe presence of ruins and excavations at places like Hangalia, Sikait,\r\nZabara, Romit, and Darahib, are evidence of mining activity in the\r\npast, but the mean nature of the accommodation for the workers,\r\nand the presence of old stone hand mills where gold was the thing\r\nsought for, confirm the statement of Diodorus[47] that the mines\r\nwere worked by miserable convicts.\r\n\r\nIn recent years much prospecting has been done to test whether the\r\nancient mines could be developed and made commercially productive\r\nunder modern conditions. In the case of many areas, including that\r\nround Darahib, the mines of which are believed to be those referred\r\nto with a map in the Turin papyrus of the Nineteenth Dynasty,[48] the\r\nprospecting licences have been surrendered to the Government because\r\nthe results were unfavourable. In a few other cases prospecting is\r\nstill being carried out, and in three localities the results have\r\nbeen sufficiently encouraging for exploitation to be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe following tables, compiled from information supplied by the\r\nMines Department, give particulars of the prospecting licences and\r\nmining leases at present (1912) held within the area described in\r\nthis book:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PROSPECTING LICENCES.\r\n\r\n  --------+----------------+---------+----------+-----------------------\r\n   Licence|Date of Licence.|Principal|Holder of |Situation of Area\r\n     No.  |                | Mineral | Licence. |licensed.\r\n          |                | sought. |          |\r\n  --------+----------------+---------+----------+-----------------------\r\n     49   | Nov.  1, 1909  |  Gold.  |Mr. Mack. |Kurdeman district.\r\n          |                |         |          |\r\n     50   |  „    1, 1909  |    „    |    „     |Sabahia district.\r\n          |                |         |          |\r\n     75   | May  14, 1911  |    „    |    „     |North-east side of\r\n          |                |         |          |Gebel Zabara.\r\n          |                |         |          |\r\n     59   | Feb. 17, 1910  |Sulphur. |   Mr.    |Gebel Ranga, near the\r\n          |                |         |Venizelos.|mouth of Wadi Abu\r\n          |                |         |          |Ghusun.\r\n          |                |         |          |\r\n     60   |  „   17, 1910  |    „    |    „     |Adjoining the\r\n          |                |         |          |foregoing.\r\n          |                |         |          |\r\n     61   |March 19, 1910  |    „    |    „     |    „     „     „\r\n  --------+----------------+---------+----------+-----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MINING LEASES.\r\n\r\n  ------+--------------+----------+----------+-----------+-------------\r\n   Lease|Date of Lease.|  Period  | Mineral  | Holder of |Area leased.\r\n    No. |              |for which |exploited.|  Lease.   |\r\n        |              | granted. |          |           |\r\n  ------+--------------+----------+----------+-----------+-------------\r\n    13  | Dec. 1, 1910 |30 years. |  Gold.   |  African  |25 acres\r\n        |              |          |          |Reefs, Ltd.|near Gebel\r\n        |              |          |          |           |Um el Tiur\r\n        |              |          |          |           |el Tahtani.\r\n        |              |          |          |           |\r\n    15  | Jan. 1, 1912 |30 years. |  Gold.   |Mr. Wells. |25 acres\r\n        |              |          |          |           |near Gebel\r\n        |              |          |          |           |Sukari.\r\n        |              |          |          |           |\r\n    55  | June 1, 1906 |30 years. | Peridot. | Peridot & |Zeberged\r\n        |              |          |          | Egyptian  |(St. John’s\r\n        |              |          |          | Gems Co., |Island).\r\n        |              |          |          |   Ltd.    |\r\n  ------+--------------+----------+----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nOf the above three mining leases, the last mentioned (the Peridot\r\nand Egyptian Gems Co., Ltd.) is the only one under which any\r\nconsiderable exploitation has been carried on, large numbers of\r\nbeautiful peridots having been obtained from the mines. The two\r\ngold mining undertakings have been commenced too recently for much\r\nto have been as yet accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Antiquities.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe archæological remains of pre-Arab times in this part of Egypt\r\ncomprise the small ruined temples of Berenice and Sikait, the ruins\r\nof stations along the old mining roads, the ancient mines with the\r\nrude habitations of the miners, and sundry markings on rocks near\r\nthe roads.\r\n\r\nThe =Temple of Berenice= is a low inconspicuous structure measuring\r\nonly some ten metres square, containing five small rooms and a tiny\r\ncorridor and staircase.[49] Owing to its exposed situation on the\r\ncoast and the soft limestone (from Ras Benas) of which it is built,\r\nit is in a very dilapidated condition, and it is difficult to make\r\nout many of the inscriptions on its walls. The axial direction of\r\nthe temple (63° 20′ east of true north) appears to show that\r\nit was oriented to face the rising sun at the summer solstice. Of\r\nthe village (one can hardly call it a city) of Berenice, only\r\ninsignificant remains exist near the temple. The houses were mere\r\nhovels built of rough lumps of coral.\r\n\r\nThere are three =temples in Wadi Sikait=; they are small rock-hewn\r\nstructures in even worse preservation than that of Berenice.[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to trace the =ancient mining roads=\r\nmentioned by classical writers. The stations on the road from _Koptos_\r\n(Quft) to Berenice, enumerated by Pliny and Antoninus, have not been\r\nwith certainty identified. The absence of any reliable map of the\r\nmain features of the country has hitherto prevented travellers from\r\nlocating the positions of stations found, while in careful surveying\r\nit has generally been necessary to travel by other roads than the\r\nancient ones, so that it cannot be hoped that all the ruined stations,\r\nmany of which are invisible till one is close to them, have been\r\nincluded in the maps. Now that all the principal features of the\r\ncountry have been accurately laid down, it will be much easier for\r\nfuture travellers to locate precisely any ruins they may come across.\r\n\r\nOf the road leading from _Contra-Apollinopolis_ (Edfu) to the\r\nemerald mines of Sikait and Zabara, much more is known, this route\r\nhaving been traversed by Golénischeff[51] and most of its stations\r\nlocated by the Geological Survey. Leading from Edfu, past Bir Abad,\r\nthe ruins of a large station and rock temple occur at a distance\r\nof about forty-five kilometres from the Nile, at a place now called\r\n_Kanais_ (the churches), where a well yielding good water was sunk\r\nthree years ago by the Mines Department. About forty-five kilometres\r\nfurther on is the station called Gariat Abu Medrik, where there are\r\ntwo ancient stucco-lined cylindrical reservoirs, but no well. At the\r\nnext station, called Samut, there is a good well in the centre of a\r\nlarge rubble ruin. As all the stations just mentioned lie outside\r\nthe limits of the maps which accompany this memoir, I give their\r\napproximate geographical positions below:—\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-----------+------------+-----------\r\n       Station.     |Latitude N.|Longitude E.| Altitude\r\n                    |           |            |above Sea.\r\n  ------------------+-----------+------------+-----------\r\n                    |           |            | metres.\r\n                    |           |            |\r\n   Edfu             |  24° 58′  |  32° 54′   |    90\r\n                    |           |            |\r\n   Kanais           |  25° 0 ′  |  33° 19′   |   205\r\n                    |           |            |\r\n   Gariat Abu Medrik|  24° 55′  |  33° 41′   |   295\r\n                    |           |            |\r\n   Samut            |  24° 49′  |  33° 54′   |   340\r\n  ------------------+-----------+------------+-----------\r\n\r\nThe next station after Samut appears to have been the ruins near\r\nGebel Dweig. Further on, after passing over the watershed, is\r\nanother station with two cisterns in a semicircular enclosure. The\r\nroad continues past Gebel Abu Had to the Wadi Gemal, where there are\r\ntwo more cisterns, this time in a triangular enclosure, and thence\r\nup to the Wadi Nugrus and Wadi Sikait to the mines. The Edfu-Sikait\r\nroad may have joined the Quft-Berenice road at the Wadi Gemal station.\r\n\r\nA third ancient road is believed to have led northward from Berenice\r\nto Qoseir, along the coast; while a fourth, from near Dakka on the\r\nNile up the Wadi Alaqi to the gold mines of the south, is now a\r\nregular route to the Nile Valley Company’s mine of Um Gariart.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =ancient emerald mines of Zabara and Sikait= consist of numerous\r\nirregular shafts, mostly of no very great depth, excavated in schists\r\nof micaceous and talcose types. The =old gold mines=, such as those\r\nat Sukari, Um Eleiga, Seiga, Romit, and the Darahib district, are on\r\na considerable scale, excavations having been carried on in quartz\r\nveins to fair depths. The dwellings at the mines were for the most\r\npart only miserable hovels of rubble stone. A view of those of Um\r\nEleiga is given on Plate IV. The ancient quartz-grinding mills, mostly\r\nmade of a hard diorite, are frequently found among the ruins of the\r\nhovels. There is no clear evidence that any of the mines yielded a\r\nvery rich output; the workings were of the nature of penal settlements\r\n(Prof. Mahaffy[52] has aptly termed them a “tropical Siberia”)\r\nin times when life and labour were cheap, and a very moderate yield\r\nmay under those conditions have been satisfactory.[53]\r\n\r\n                                                             PLATE IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ruins of Um Eleiga. Gebel Abu Dahr in the Background.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ruins in Wadi Shenshef.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides those at the mining camps and stations, there are some\r\nother extensive collections of ruins in the district, two of the\r\nmost considerable being at Shenshef and Bir Meneiga. The =ruins at\r\nShenshef= (_see_ Plate IV) are in part those of well-built houses,\r\nfurnished with doors and windows, formed of slabs of fissile quartzose\r\nschist, quarried in the neighbouring hills. There are wells at\r\nShenshef, but apparently no mines; the presence of watch towers on\r\nthe hills, and the peculiar situation of the place, suggest that it\r\nmay have been a slave dealer’s stronghold where slaves were herded\r\ntill they could be shipped from Berenice. The better houses may have\r\nbeen those of the overseers, while the ruder hovels accommodated the\r\nslaves, and sentinels at the watch towers prevented any attempt at\r\nescape. The =ruins at Bir Meneiga=, though extensive, are very rude,\r\nand probably only represent a camping ground near the springs. A large\r\nrubble enclosure near Abraq springs has been thought by Purdy[54]\r\nto have been a hunting station of the Ptolemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many places there are =marks and drawings on the rocks= near\r\nroads. These are frequently spirited representations of animals,\r\namong which the ostrich is often seen. At the Galt el Aguz, near\r\nthe watershed at the head of one of the branches of Wadi Garara,\r\nthe drawings are accompanied by rude Greek inscriptions. At Abu\r\nSaafa, one of the springs issues from a niche cut in the sandstone,\r\nhaving a carved cornice with the remains of a Greek inscription on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother class of remains are found scattered over the area in the\r\nform of =cylindrical rubble piles=, four metres in diameter and from\r\none to two metres high. The natives consider these to be tombs of\r\npre-Arab date.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf =Arab tombs= in the area, the most considerable is that of\r\nSheikh Shadli, near Gebel Abu Hamamid, a view of which is shown on\r\nPlate V. It is a well-built tomb of several domes, inhabited by a\r\nMoorish guardian. A yearly pilgrimage is made to this place by the\r\nAbabda Arabs, who hold the memory of Shadli in high veneration. The\r\nnext largest tomb is probably that of Sheikh Hamid, near Abraq\r\nsprings. Near the nose of Ras Benas is a large sheikh’s tomb,\r\nwhere sailors perform their devotions, and smaller tombs of the\r\nsame type, built of drift-wood, are to be seen at other points near\r\nthe coast. Cemeteries of small Arab graves exist near every well\r\nand spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Inhabitants.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South-Eastern Desert of Egypt is inhabited by nomad Arabs of the\r\nvarious Ababda and Bisharin tribes.[55] Ababda (Ashabab and Meleikab)\r\noccupy the country north of Muqsim and Bir Shalatein, while Bisharin\r\n(Hamedorab, Kurbeilab, Koatil, and Balgab) inhabit the country to\r\nthe south.[56] Only guesses are available as to their numbers, but\r\nit is not probable that they comprise so much as one inhabitant for\r\neach five square kilometres. A casual journey through the country\r\nwould lead one to think that it was inhabited to an even less\r\ndegree, but the Arabs mostly camp in selected narrow wadis out of\r\nsight of the traveller. They are a people of good physique, hardy,\r\nintelligent, and fair workers if once their employer knows how to\r\nhandle them. They share, however, in the universal Bedouin dislike to\r\nprotracted regular work; after a few months of regular routine, even\r\nthe semi-nomad routine of a survey-expedition, they experience strong\r\ndesires for their own independent roaming life, and it is impossible\r\nto retain them for longer periods. Many of the Ababda who are settled\r\nnear the Nile have lost their true desert character, and on desert\r\nexpeditions men of this class are far less satisfactory than nomads;\r\nthey do not know the country, but fear the desert and are continually\r\ndesirous of returning to the valley. The better desert guides,\r\non the other hand, love the wilderness, and they have a perfectly\r\nmarvellous geographic instinct. The skeleton on which they arrange\r\ntheir knowledge is always the system of drainage. If a map of their\r\ncountry is laid before them, and a few points named to them, they\r\nwill delight in tracing out and naming all the wadis and peaks. But\r\nthey have very vague ideas of proportion, and can only read a map\r\nwhen it is laid on the ground in its true orientation with respect\r\nto the meridian. The Ababda are generally regarded as the best type\r\nof Egyptian desert Arab, while my experience of the Bisharin of the\r\nElba district is that they are superior, in industry, intelligence,\r\ntruthfulness, and orderliness, to the Ababda.[57] It is, however,\r\nnecessary either to understand the Bishari tongue, or to have men\r\nwho can interpret into Arabic, as the great mass of the Bisharin\r\nunderstand only their own language, which is quite different from\r\nArabic.[58] Education is very backward, but there is a _kuttab_\r\n(elementary school) at Halaib, where instruction in Arabic reading\r\nand writing is given to boys. All the Arabs are of course Moslems,\r\nbut they are not at all fanatical.\r\n\r\n                                                              PLATE V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tomb of Sheikh Shadli.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bir Shadli.]\r\n\r\nThe manner of life of the Arabs is very simple. Most of the men have\r\nonly a single cotton wrap about their middle, though some wear the\r\nordinary galabia and cotton drawers. Their camps are rude tents of\r\nmatting about two metres in diameter, but the men commonly sleep in\r\nthe open, sheltering themselves from winds by their camel saddles,\r\ncovered only with their cotton wrap, which they spread over their\r\nentire bodies, including their heads. They wear no head covering,\r\nhaving heavy “mops” of curled black hair plentifully supplied\r\nwith mutton fat. Their food consists almost entirely of milk and\r\nmeat, of which their flocks and herds give them a plentiful supply;\r\nthey eat but little bread, but they are fond of a kind of gruel of\r\nflour and water, and of dates, which are imported from Arabia _via_\r\nSuakin. Only a few of them smoke tobacco, and that generally in\r\nsoapstone pipes which they carve out for themselves. Intoxicants are\r\nunknown amongst true desert Arabs. For arms, they carry swords and\r\nknives, seldom fire-arms. Of their tribal customs, I saw but little;\r\nLinant de Bellefonds gives an interesting account of them in his\r\n“L’Etbaye.” On festive occasions, camel-racing and dancing\r\nare favourite amusements.\r\n\r\nSlavery appears to be non-existent at present, for in the course of\r\nmy twenty months’ wanderings I received no complaint under this\r\nhead, as I should almost certainly have done had any oppressive\r\nservitude existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Languages.=\r\n\r\n\r\nMy own study of the Ababda and Bishari tongues has been mainly\r\nconfined to their geographical terms. The Ababda nowadays almost\r\nall speak Arabic, and most of their place-names are either Arabic or\r\nclosely akin to it. A marked feature of their tongue is a fondness\r\nfor diminutives. Thus we have _Sellim_ and _Seleim_, _Hafafit_ and\r\n_Hefeifit_, _Faraid_, and _Fereyid_, _Wadi_ and _Wadai_, in each of\r\nwhich the second of the pair is a diminutive formed by vowel-change,\r\ngenerally accompanied by a change in the placing of the stress. The\r\ncommonest special geographical terms in Ababda country are: _erf_,\r\na ridge; _rod_, a tributary wadi; _talet_, a small tributary wadi;\r\n_kab_, a watershed or pass; _hamrat_, a (red) granite mountain;\r\n_zergat_, a black mountain; _galt_, a rock basin containing rain\r\nwater; and _megal_, a small water hole. Thus we have such names as\r\n_Hamrat Selma_, _Zergat Naam_, and so on, the name often giving a\r\nclue to the nature of the rock.\r\n\r\nAs soon as one passes into Bisharin country the change in the\r\nnature of place-names is very striking. The definite article is no\r\nlonger _el_, but _o_, _u_, _ei_, _e_ (masc.), and _to_, _tu_, _tei_,\r\n_ti_ (fem.). Many place-names end in _ai_ and _oi_. The principal\r\ngeographical terms are: _kwan_, a wadi; _da-aiyob_, a depression from\r\nwhich there is no drainage outlet; _aweib_ and _riba_, a mountain;\r\n_kulet_, a hill; _megwel_, a water hole; _adar_, red; _hadal_,\r\nblack; _sotai_, green; _eire_, white; _sarara_, deep; _salala_,\r\nrather deep (applied to wells). Hence we get such combinations as:\r\n_Hadal Aweib Meisah_, the black mountain near Wadi Meisah; _Eir\r\nArib_, the white (granite) rock; _Sarobi Kwan_, the wadi where\r\nthe Sarob plant (_Capparis sodada_) grows; _Bir Sararat Seyet_,\r\nthe deep well in Wadi Seyet, and so on. A mountain called _adar_ is\r\ngenerally of red granite, while one called _hadal_ is usually diorite\r\nor serpentine. _Asotriba_, the green mountain south of Gebel Elba,\r\nreceives its name from the vegetation on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Industries.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal industries carried on by the desert Arabs are the\r\nrearing of camels, sheep and goats, especially the first-named. The\r\nBisharin devote much attention to camel-breeding, and supply many\r\nanimals annually to the Coast Guard Administration. Their camels are\r\nvery superior animals, and need to be hardy in order to negotiate\r\nthe steep mountain passes of their country. Sheep and goats can be\r\nbought cheaply in the south, and are driven in to Aswân for sale\r\nat the higher rates there prevailing. It is common to find a flock\r\nof hundreds of sheep being watered at wells such as Bir Abu Hashim\r\nand Qoleib on the route to Kom Ombo; but many animals drop and die\r\non the weary march from well to well.\r\n\r\nCharcoal burning has been practised, especially in the Ababda country,\r\nbut is not much carried on now; this industry deserves strong\r\nopposition, for it only impoverishes the country, and the _seyal_\r\ntrees are few enough for the support of camels in years of drought.\r\n\r\nIn recent years some employment has been found for the Arabs\r\nby prospectors for mining companies, both as miners and for\r\ncamel-transport, and they are occasionally, as in the present\r\nexpedition, employed on Government work.\r\n\r\nFor the information of future travellers, it may be worth\r\nwhile to mention the prices paid for local labour on the survey\r\nexpeditions. The men and animals were all the best obtainable of\r\ntheir particular class, and the prices include saddles and fodder\r\nfor camels, their own provision of water and food for the men, and,\r\nin the case of sheikhs, postmen, and guides, their riding camels\r\nand fodder:—\r\n\r\n                                                   _Mills, per day._[59]\r\n\r\n  Responsible sheikhs in charge of all Arabs               200\r\n\r\n  Skilled guides (also employed as beacon builders)        150\r\n\r\n  Postmen journeying regularly to and from the\r\n  Nile Valley                                              150\r\n\r\n  Baggage camels, each to carry 300 pounds’ load,\r\n  with one driver to every two camels, the drivers\r\n  to act as general labourers at a camp and to\r\n  collect wood and water and to carry supplies up\r\n  the mountains when required                              120\r\n\r\n  Riding camels                                            120\r\n\r\n  Porters                                             70 to 80\r\n\r\nA small amount of agriculture is practised in the Wadi Di-ib, slightly\r\nsouth of the Sudan frontier, but there is none actually within the\r\ndistrict here described. My camels were fed for some time on _durra_\r\n(Indian corn) brought from Wadi Di-ib.\r\n\r\nA little fishing is carried on near Berenice and at Mersa Shab and\r\nHalaib, but only for the food of the fishermen, who subsist almost\r\nentirely on it, and thus recall the _Ichthyophages_ of Ptolemy. When\r\nI had abundance of excellent fish at Shab and Halaib, I noticed\r\nthat but few of my Bisharin cared to partake of what was to me a\r\nvery welcome change of diet.\r\n\r\nHalaib is the only permanent village, and even it is merely a\r\nmiserable collection of wooden huts and tents, where trade is\r\nconfined to dates, fat, corn, sugar, and such like necessaries;\r\nsupplies are brought by boat from Suakin and sold to the local Arabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Communications.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous camel-roads connecting the various wells with each\r\nother and with the Nile, the principal of which are indicated on Plate\r\nIII (p. 26). The most usual starting points from the valley are Edfu,\r\nKom Ombo, Aswân, Dakka, and Berber. The roads lie mostly along wadis,\r\nand are far from being very direct, being necessarily so chosen as\r\nto pass water supplies and to avoid very steep places. From Aswân\r\nor Kom Ombo, Berenice can be reached in about seven or eight days\r\nby luggage camels, and the roads are fairly good; water is least\r\nscarce on the Kom Ombo road, which takes advantage of the wells of\r\nQoleib and Abu Hashim. Between any two wells, there are generally\r\nseveral possible roads. The one taken by any particular traveller is\r\nnaturally that which his guides happen to know best, or that along\r\nwhich the most camel food is to be found at the time; hardly any two\r\nEuropeans have journeyed by precisely the same road. A “road”\r\nin desert parlance is only a track by which camels have passed at\r\nsome time or other; there is nothing of the nature of a _made_ road,\r\neven along the ancient routes mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary; and\r\nthe tracks are sometimes obliterated by sand. Since the opening up of\r\nPort Sudan, the Elba district is most easily reached from that place,\r\nwhence it is about 340 kilometres distant, by two roads of nearly\r\nequal length, one skirting the coast and the other more inland; the\r\nlatter passes good wells at about two days’ intervals.[60] To reach\r\nElba from the valley, a camel journey of more than 500 kilometres is\r\nnecessary whether Aswân, Dakka, or Berber be the starting point. The\r\nports of Berenice, Shab, and Halaib are only touched occasionally\r\nand irregularly by coasting boats and Coast Guard steamers. News is\r\npassed orally among the wandering Arabs with remarkable rapidity,\r\nbut naturally it frequently gets somewhat modified in transit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Government.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geographical frontier between Egypt and the Sudan is the 22nd\r\nparallel of north latitude. But for administrative purposes it\r\nhas been found convenient to consider all Bisharin Arabs as under\r\nthe Sudan Government, and all Ababda under that of Egypt. The\r\nadministrative frontier therefore runs between the districts of the\r\ntwo main tribal divisions, along a zigzag line from Gebel Muqsim,\r\n_via_ Gebel Um el Tiur el Foqani, Gebel Niqrub el Foqani, and Bir\r\nMeneiga, to Bir Shalatein on the coast.[61] A territory of some\r\n16,000 square kilometres in the extreme south-east corner of Egypt\r\nis thus placed for purposes of government under the Sudan mudiria\r\nof Berber, under which arrangement a moawin and small police force\r\nare maintained in the fort of Halaib. The remainder of the area is\r\nadministered by the Egyptian mudir of Aswân. In Egypt, the Arabs\r\nare not taxed except in respect of any lands they may own in the\r\nNile Valley. In the Sudan a tax is levied on each tribe in return\r\nfor police protection and other advantages; the tax is paid very\r\nwillingly, for the Bisharin are less poor than the Ababda, and\r\nthoroughly appreciate the advantage of good government, while they\r\nhave unbounded faith in the justice of Anglo-Egyptian officials in\r\nsettling their disputes. One of the incidents which most strongly\r\nimpressed itself on my remembrance during my travels in the district\r\nwas the meeting near Gebel Korabkansi of an English inspector from\r\nBerber, to whom a number of Bisharin Arabs engaged in disputes stated\r\ntheir rival claims quietly and reasonably, both sides having the\r\nutmost confidence that the judgment given would be just and fair. In\r\nEgypt, the Arabs are less friendly in their feelings towards the\r\ngovernment, and prefer to settle their differences among themselves;\r\na circumstance no doubt due to the fact that Egyptian governors\r\nhave had their hands full with matters connected with the valley,\r\nand have had no time to become acquainted with Bedouin ideas and\r\ncustoms, while the Arabs, independent for centuries and very poor,\r\nare afraid of misunderstanding and taxation. It would, I think, be\r\nunfair to tax the true desert Arabs of Egypt, even to the moderate\r\nextent which is done for the Arabs of the Sudan, for their country\r\nis much more barren than that of the Bisharin, and their sources of\r\nincome are consequently fewer. In a year of little or no rainfall,\r\nthere is not enough vegetation to feed their animals, so that many\r\nare lost, and the only way a tax could be raised at such times would\r\nbe by cutting down trees for charcoal; but, as already mentioned,\r\nany encouragement of the charcoal industry would soon impoverish the\r\ncountry still further, the thorny acacia trees being the principal\r\nreserve camel food in rainless years. That so many Ababda are\r\nsettled in and near the Nile Valley is possibly in part due to their\r\nhaving been driven from the desert by the growing scarcity of trees\r\nconsequent on the prosecution of the charcoal industry in the past.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: The mountains and hills will be found described in\r\nfuller detail in Chapter VI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The altitudes refer to the highest points of the\r\ngroups.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: This is the altitude of Shendib, the highest of the\r\ngroup in Egypt; but the peaks of Asotriba, which is part of the same\r\nmass lying within the Sudan, rise considerably higher.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: In the map on Plate I, I have shown the watershed\r\ncrossing directly from Gebel Soaorib across the high intervening\r\nmountains to Gebel Is, which is how it appeared to me from my station\r\non Hadal Aweib Meisah. But Mr. Morrow Campbell’s map (referred to\r\non p. 15) shows the heads of Wadi Soaorib to extend further west\r\nthan I could see them; and if this is correct, as it probably is\r\nsince Mr. Morrow Campbell doubtless approached the watershed more\r\nclosely than I did, the watershed between Gebel Soaorib and Gebel\r\nIs lies further west than I have shown it on Plate I.

A level\r\ntract having been selected, in such a position as to afford easy\r\nconnection with points already triangulated from the Nile Valley,\r\na line about two and a half kilometres long was ranged out, along\r\nwhich wooden pegs were driven flush with the ground at 100-metre\r\nintervals. The inequalities of the ground between the pegs were\r\nlevelled off by tiny embankments and cuttings, so as to enable\r\nthe tape to lie flat. On each peg was nailed a zinc plate having a\r\nmillimetre scale running in the direction of the line. In measuring,\r\nthe tape was laid on the ground, stretched to a constant tension by a\r\nspring balance at each end, in such manner that its end marks fell on\r\nthe zinc scales, and readings were simultaneously taken on the scales\r\nat the two ends. Temperatures were taken in several places along\r\nthe tape by mercurial thermometers. The operation of measurement\r\nwas carried out in the early morning, so as to avoid any large\r\ndifference of temperature between the ground and the air. The levels\r\nof the pegs were found by spirit levelling. After correction for the\r\ninitial error of the tape, temperature, stretch, and inclination,\r\nthe true length of the base-line reduced to sea-level was found,\r\nas the mean of two separate measurements at different tensions,\r\nto be 2,482·280 metres. The azimuth of the line was found by\r\nobservations of _Polaris_ at elongation to be 30° 30′ 6″ E. of\r\nN. The geographical position of the west end of the line was found by\r\ntriangulation-connexion with the Nile Valley by Mr. Villiers Stuart\r\nto be latitude 24° 53′ 36″·7 N., longitude 34° 4′ 17″·9 E.\r\n\r\nA second connexion to a base-line was made near Gebel Um Harba, where\r\na base had been previously measured by Mr. Villiers Stuart in the\r\ncourse of his triangulation of the western part of the desert. In\r\nthis case the connexion was not made to the actual base-line, but\r\nto another main line tied directly on to it. The data at this point\r\nof connexion from the two triangulations afforded a useful check on\r\nthe accuracy of the work, and were as follows:—\r\n\r\n  ------------------+------------------+----------------+------------\r\n                    |From Mr. Stuart’s |    From my     |Difference.\r\n                    |  triangulation.  | triangulation. |\r\n                    +------------------+----------------+------------\r\n   Latitude N.      |  23° 36′ 55″·0   | 23° 36′ 55″·6  |   0″·6\r\n                    |                  |                |\r\n   Longitude E.     |  34° 30′ 38″·1   | 34° 30′ 37″·6  |   0″·5\r\n                    |                  |                |\r\n   Length of line   |                  |                |\r\n   to Dagalai beacon| 13,170·2 metres. |13,167·9 metres.|2·3 metres.\r\n  ------------------+------------------+----------------+------------\r\n\r\n=Reconnaissance for triangulation points= was carried out\r\nsimultaneously with the triangulation itself. The distance of likely\r\nlooking peaks was determined either by intersecting them from distant\r\nstations, or by special small triangulations from short bases, and\r\nsuch selection made as seemed most likely to secure well shaped\r\nfigures and a good command of surrounding country. As a rule,\r\nthe highest summits were selected as main (occupied) stations,\r\nwhile all other prominent peaks and other features were fixed by\r\nintersection from two or more main stations. The form adopted for\r\nthe main triangulation net was a series of quadrilateral figures\r\nwith diagonals, combined with centric polygons, all the angles of\r\nthe figures being generally measured. The average length of side\r\nwas about thirty-five kilometres.\r\n\r\n=Beacons.=—Main stations were marked by wrought-iron beacons,\r\nconsisting of two lengths of stove piping about 15 centimetres\r\ndiameter by 1½ metres long, the upper length fitting into a faucet\r\nmade by splaying out the lower tube. Near the top of the tube were\r\naffixed four sheet iron wings, bolted on to angle iron cleats. A\r\nconical cairn of stones was built up round the tube, nearly up to the\r\nwings, so that the beacon when erected was about three metres high,\r\ntwo metres in diameter across the base of the cairn, and about a\r\nmetre wide across the wings. The beacons were taken down while a\r\nstation was being occupied, and replaced on leaving.\r\n\r\nIntersected points were sometimes marked with a beacon or cairn,\r\nbut in general the peaks were simply bisected from several stations,\r\nas it was found that this gave sufficiently accurate results.\r\n\r\n=Measurement of Horizontal Angles.=—Angles were measured with a\r\n6-inch theodolite furnished with reading microscopes graduated to\r\n10″ and permitting of reliable estimations to 1″. The angles\r\nbetween main points were read on four arcs to eliminate circle\r\nerrors. Intersected points were observed on one arc only. The average\r\nerror of closure of main triangles was 3″·3.\r\n\r\n=Field Computation and Plotting of Triangulated Points.=—The\r\ntriangles were computed by the ordinary method, but the angles\r\nwere rounded off to 10″ to enable the sines to be taken direct\r\nfrom the logarithmic tables, and the logarithms were only taken\r\nto five places. The length of the sides having been thus found, the\r\ngeographical positions were found by the ordinary _L M Z_ computation,\r\nusing, however, only two latitude terms and 5-place logarithms,\r\nwhile azimuths were only taken out to the nearest 10″. The\r\nabbreviated form of computation used will be best illustrated by\r\nan example:—[63]\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Computation of Position of_ △ _No. 260 from No. 275._\r\n\r\n             _l_ = 20042 m.                       {  φ  = 23° 55′  30″·6\r\n                                              275 {\r\n             _Z_ = 64° 29′  20″ E of N.           {  λ  = 34° 54′  36″·9\r\n\r\n         Log _l_ = 4·30194                     Log _l_² = 8·604\r\n                   -                                      -\r\n     Log cos _Z_ = 1·63416                 Log sin² _Z_ = 1·911\r\n                   -                                      -\r\n         _B_       2·51194                     _C_      = 9·053\r\n                   -------                                -----\r\n                                                          -\r\n                   2·44804                              = 1·568\r\n                   -------                                -----\r\n  _d_φ, 1st term =       + 280″·6               Log _l_ = 4·30194\r\n                                                          -\r\n        2nd term =       −   0″·4           Log sin _Z_ = 1·95545\r\n                   --------------                         -\r\n           _d_φ  =         280″·2                  _A′_ = 2·50948\r\n                                                          -------\r\n                 =      4′  40″·2                       = 2·76687\r\n                                                          -\r\n              φ  = 23° 55′  30″·6            Log cos φ′ = 1·96072\r\n                   --------------                         -------\r\n              φ′ = 24°  0′  10″·8                       = 2·80615\r\n                   --------------                         -------\r\n                                                  _d_λ  =         640″·0\r\n\r\n         Whence                                         =     10′  40″·0\r\n\r\n           {  φ′ = 24°  0′  10″·8                    λ  = 34° 54′  36″·9\r\n       260 {                                              --------------\r\n           {  λ′ = 35°  5′  16″·9                    λ′ = 35°  5′  16″·9\r\n                                                          --------------\r\n\r\nIn the above, it will be noticed that the azimuth is always noted\r\nas so much east or west of north or south. If this convention be\r\nadopted, one may consider the first term of _d_φ as always +,\r\nand the second term will be + if the azimuth contains the word\r\nsouth,—if it is from the north, while the total _d_φ is to be added\r\nor subtracted according as one is going north or south. A somewhat\r\nsimilar convention is adopted in neglecting the sign of _d_λ till\r\nthe actual addition or subtraction is made. It was found in the\r\nfield that this method prevented any mistake of sign, while being\r\nmuch simpler to work than one involving angles greater than 90°.\r\n\r\nThe geographical coordinates thus found were plotted directly on to\r\nthe plane-table sheets, on which the graticule at 10′ intervals\r\nwas the first thing drawn. The odd minutes and seconds were first\r\nconverted into minutes and decimals, and then into kilometres by\r\nmultiplying by the factors appropriate to the latitude, so that the\r\nplotting could be done by the ordinary scale of kilometres. To avoid\r\ndifficulties of paper-shrinkage, as many points as possible were\r\nplotted at the time of drawing the graticule, and in general the\r\npoints had to be plotted as far ahead as possible for controlling\r\nthe traversing and sketching.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Astronomical Observations.=—Astronomical checks on the\r\ntriangulation were obtained by observations of latitude at certain\r\nselected main stations 60-120 kilometres apart, and by azimuth\r\nobservations for certain main lines.\r\n\r\nThe method used for =latitude= was that of observing the times of\r\nequal altitudes of three or more stars, selected as near to the\r\nmeridian[64] as possible. This method presents great advantages\r\nover the usual _Polaris_ and circummeridian altitudes, in that the\r\nobservations are more easily made, and yield much more accurate\r\nresults, because uncertainties in refraction are largely eliminated\r\nand the errors of circle graduation are not involved, the altitudes\r\nnot being read at all.[65] The theodolite used was the same as\r\nwas employed in triangulation, and the times were taken by a half\r\nchronometer watch, preferably one marking sidereal time with a rate\r\nwhich could be considered negligible during the hour or so occupied\r\nby the observation. The first star taken was usually _Polaris_, and\r\nthe vertical circle was left clamped at its altitude. For the other\r\nstars, any dislevelment was corrected by touching up the levelling\r\nscrews just before the instant of observation; this was found better,\r\nthan taking bubble readings and correcting for slight difference\r\nof altitude.\r\n\r\nThe method which I found best in the field for reducing\r\nthe observations differs somewhat from that described by\r\nChauvenet. Assuming approximate values for the latitude and watch\r\nerror, I first calculated the altitude of each star from the formula\r\n\r\n\r\n  sin _h_ = sin φ sin ε + cos φ cos δ cos _t_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the assumed latitude and watch error were correct, all the stars\r\nwould give the same value for _h_. If not, each star would give an\r\nequation of the form\r\n\r\n\r\n  _h_ + cos _A_ _d_φ + cos φ sin _A_ _dT_ − _h_0 = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere _A_ is the star’s azimuth, _d_φ the required correction\r\nto the assumed latitude, _dT_ the required correction to the\r\nassumed watch times, and _h_0 the true altitude common to the three\r\nstars. The values of cos _A_ and cos φ sin _A_ were calculated from\r\nthe ordinary formula\r\n\r\n\r\n  sin _A_ = (cos δ sin _t_)/cos _h_\r\n\r\n\r\nby four-place logarithms (using the approximate values for φ, _t_,\r\nand _h_, since these are quite sufficiently accurate for the purpose)\r\nand inserted into the three star-equations.[66] By then solving the\r\nthree simultaneous equations for _d_φ, the required correction to\r\nthe assumed latitude was at once obtained.\r\n\r\nAs the method is one not usually treated of in books on practical\r\nastronomy, I give on the following pages the reduction of an\r\nobservation worked out in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Latitude by Equal Altitudes of Three Stars._\r\n\r\nStation on Gebel Um Heshenib.

In that case the watch error was found at once from the\r\ndifference between the star’s R.A. and the mean of the two observed\r\ntimes, and the latitude could be found from two equations instead of\r\nthree. The condition for this modification of the method was that\r\na nautical almanac star could be found culminating at an altitude\r\nslightly greater than that of _Polaris_ at a time convenient for the\r\nobservation. It is not advisable to select a star which would give too\r\nlong an interval between the equal east and west altitudes. The best\r\nresults are obtainable when the interval between the two observations\r\nof the south star is about an hour, and when _Polaris_ is near its\r\ntransit. Under such circumstances the watch correction is obtained\r\nquite nearly enough for a good latitude; for, as Gauss[67] pointed\r\nout, “the essential condition is not so much that the precise\r\ninstant when the star reaches a supposed place should be noted,\r\nas that at the time which is noted the star should not be sensibly\r\ndistant from that place.”\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the latitudes found by observation and\r\ntriangulation at the various points. It may be remarked that the\r\nmethod used for latitude determination was liable to observational\r\nerrors of 2″ or so, as well as to errors of possibly more\r\nthan double that amount due to plumb-line deflection among the\r\nmountains,[68] so that the observed latitudes were only taken as\r\nchecks to prevent any gross error in triangulation being overlooked,\r\nand not for any determination of the figure of the earth, for which\r\nlatter purpose more elaborate observations would have been necessary.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------------\r\n                      |Lat. observed.|Lat. computed |    Difference\r\n         Point.       |              |     from     |computed-observed.\r\n                      |              |Triangulation.|\r\n  --------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------------\r\n   West Peg, Muelih   |24° 53′ 40″·3 |24° 53′ 36″·7 |      − 3″·6\r\n   Base               |              |              |\r\n                      |              |              |\r\n   Beacon on Gebel Um |24° 20′ 56″·5 |24° 20′ 49″·2 |      − 7″·3\r\n   Heshenib           |              |              |\r\n                      |              |              |\r\n     „    „  Hill near|23° 55′ 33″·2 |23° 55′ 30″·6 |      − 2″·6\r\n   Gebel Selaia       |              |              |\r\n                      |              |              |\r\n     „    „  Berenice |23° 54′ 39″·5 |23° 54′ 40″·3 |      − 0″·8\r\n   Temple             |              |              |\r\n                      |              |              |\r\n     „    „  Gimeida  |22° 46′ 33″·2 |22° 46′ 29″·4 |      − 3″·8\r\n   Hill               |              |              |\r\n  --------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Azimuths= were determined in the usual manner[69] by elongations\r\nof close circumpolar stars, _Polaris_ or _51 Cephei_ being usually\r\nselected.

On\r\narriving at an azimuth station, therefore, a fresh chain of azimuths\r\nwas begun from the results of the observation, and continued to the\r\nnext station where astronomical observations were undertaken. The\r\naccumulated azimuth error was, however, never found to exceed 10″\r\nin any chain, a quantity which could not sensibly affect the computed\r\npositions of points for plotting on the maps.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Connexion with the Sudan Surveys.=—At the south end of the\r\narea, connexion was made to a number of points triangulated by\r\nthe Sudan Surveys, but as the Sudan triangulation was commenced\r\nas an independent piece of work from an observed latitude and a\r\ntelegraphically determined longitude, the connexion affords no\r\ncheck on the accuracy of the triangulations. The difference found\r\nbetween my positions and those of the Sudan Surveys was practically\r\nconstant for all the Sudan points connected, and amounted to 3″·5\r\nin latitude and 26″ in longitude[70]; these figures represent the\r\nerrors in the assumed latitude and longitude of the starting point\r\nof the Sudan Surveys, and will be employed as corrections to the\r\nSudan positions now that a complete chain of triangulation connects\r\nBerber with the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Levels of Triangulation Points.=—The altitudes above sea-level\r\nof all triangulation points were determined by vertical angular\r\nmeasurements carried out at the occupied stations, an actual sea-level\r\ndatum being obtained by including rocks awash in the sea among the\r\ntriangulated points. To secure constancy of atmospheric refraction\r\nas far as possible, vertical angles were always read in the middle of\r\nthe day, where the change of refraction is slowest. For the occupied\r\nstations, refraction and curvature were eliminated by reciprocal\r\nobservations. For intersected points the formula _h_ = _d_ _tan_\r\nθ + (1 − _k_)/2_r_ _d_² was used, the value of _d_ tan θ being\r\nfirst found by five-figure logarithms and then that of the curvature\r\nand refraction correction (1 − _k_)/2_r_ _d_² by means of the very\r\nconvenient “Universal” slide rule of Nessler.[71] The value of _k_\r\nfound from a discussion of the first few reciprocal observations was\r\nfound to be very nearly 0·13, corresponding with the mean of European\r\ndeterminations, and this value for the coefficient was employed\r\nthroughout the work for intersected points.[72] For obtaining the\r\ncorrection (1 − _k_)/2_r_ _d_² by the slide rule, a mark _R_ was\r\nscratched at 1210[73] on the lower scale of the slide; by bringing\r\nthis mark _R_ opposite to the distance (in kilometres) on the lower\r\nscale (or, where the logarithm of the distance was more convenient,\r\nby bringing the mark vertically under that logarithm on the log scale\r\nof the rule by means of the cursor) the correction could be read off\r\ndirectly on the lowest fixed scale opposite the end-graduation of\r\nthe slide. Usually four or five values for the altitude of a single\r\npoint were obtained from a corresponding number of stations, and\r\nthe mean taken; the various values generally agreed within two metres.\r\n\r\nThe constant combination of vertical angular measurements with\r\nhorizontal ones was of great service from another point of view\r\nfrom that of providing altitude data for the maps. It frequently\r\nhappened that a peak observed at one station could not be identified\r\namong a number of similar peaks visible at another station. When\r\nthis trouble arose, the vertical angles offered a way out of\r\nthe difficulty. Vertical and horizontal angles were read off to\r\na number of likely-looking peaks; on working out the triangles to\r\nthe nearest minute of the observed angles, the distance of each peak\r\nwas obtained on the assumption that it was the one required. Then to\r\nfind which of the several peaks was the correct one, the elevations\r\nwere worked out, assuming the distances correct; in only one case\r\nwould the level agree from the two stations, and this obviously\r\ndiscriminated the peak required. The working out of the triangles\r\nfor this purpose could be done with sufficient accuracy in a very\r\nfew minutes by means of the slide rule, and many points were thus\r\nsaved from rejection consequent on misidentification.\r\n\r\nChecks on absolute level were frequently obtained by observing\r\ndepression angles to the sea horizon, using the formula θ = 107·8\r\n√{_h_}, where θ is in seconds of arc and _h_ is the altitude in\r\nmetres. But for high stations the horizon is so distant that very\r\nsmall variations in refraction cause rather large errors in the\r\nresult, so that this method only furnished a rough check.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 =Summary of Triangulated Positions.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following tables give the geographical positions and altitudes\r\nabove sea-level of all points triangulated, arranged in order of\r\ndiminishing latitude, _i.e._, from north to south. The list includes\r\nthe points fixed within the Sudan for connexion with the Sudan\r\nSurveys. Stations occupied are indicated by an asterisk against the\r\nnumber of the point. It will be noticed that in some cases several\r\ndifferent mountains bear the same name though widely distant from\r\neach other; also that where a single mountain mass possesses several\r\npeaks or summits, each of these has been fixed separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SUMMARY OF TRIANGULATED POSITIONS.\r\n\r\n  --------+--------------------+-----------+--------+---------+---------\r\n    Field |                    |           |        |         |\r\n    Number|       Name.        |   Mark.   |Latitude|Longitude|Altitude\r\n      of  |                    |           |   N.   |   E.    | Metres.\r\n    Point.|                    |           |        |         |\r\n  --------+--------------------+-----------+--------+---------+---------\r\n          |                    |           | °  ′  ″| °  ′  ″ |\r\n          |                    |           |        |         |\r\n       21 |G.

Koss, who accompanied the Austrian\r\nresearch-ship “Pola” in 1895-6.[74] The three best defined points\r\nof comparison are Berenice temple, the central peak of St. John’s\r\nIsland, and Halaib Fort. In the case of Berenice and St. John’s\r\nIsland the observation of the two prior surveys were made at stations\r\na little distance from my triangulation points, but the published\r\ncharts enable one to scale off the necessary corrections to reduce\r\nthe positions to those of the triangulated points. At Berenice,\r\nthe British Admiralty observation point, for which the latitude is\r\ngiven as 23° 56′ 16″, is 1′ 26″ north of the temple, so\r\nthat the equivalent Admiralty latitude for the temple is 23° 54′\r\n50″. Similarly Lieut. Koss’s observation point, where the latitude\r\nfound was 23° 56′ 27″, is 1′ 47″ north of the temple, giving\r\nthe latitude of the temple as 23° 54′ 40″. My triangulation\r\ngives the latitude of the temple as 23° 54′ 39″, thus showing a\r\nremarkably good agreement with that found by the “Pola” observer.\r\n\r\nAt St. John’s Island, owing to the smallness of the scale of\r\nthe available charts, it is a little more difficult to scale off\r\naccurately the Admiralty position for the peak and the reduction\r\nto the peak of Lieut. Koss’s point. As nearly as I can scale,\r\nthe Admiralty latitude for the peak is 23° 36′ 40″, while the\r\npoint where Lieut. Koss observed his latitude of 23° 35′ 47″,\r\nnear the south-west shore of the island, is approximately 40″ south\r\nof the peak, giving the latitude of the peak as 23° 36′ 27″. I\r\nfound the latitude of the peak to be 23° 36′ 16″, thus again\r\nshowing as good an agreement as could be expected, having regard to\r\nthe fact that it is not easy to scale the latitude of the point much\r\nwithin 10″ from the existing charts.\r\n\r\nAt Halaib Fort, the Admiralty latitude is 22° 14′ 10″, while the\r\n“Pola” expedition found it 22° 13′ 26″, and my triangulation\r\ngave the value 22° 13′ 25″. The close agreement between my\r\ntriangulation value and that observed by Lieut. Koss seems to prove\r\nthe Admiralty latitude of this point to be some 45″ too high.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the latitudes of the three points for comparison we\r\nhave:—\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n                       | Berenice  |St. John’s |Halaib Fort.\r\n                       |  Temple.  |   Peak.   |\r\n                       +-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n   Admiralty Chart     |23° 54′ 50″|23° 36′ 40″|22° 14′ 10″\r\n                       |           |           |\r\n   “Pola” Expedition   |23° 54′ 40″|23° 36′ 27″|22° 13′ 26″\r\n                       |           |           |\r\n   Ball (Triangulation)|23° 54′ 39″|23° 36′ 16″|22° 13′ 25″\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nIf we make corresponding comparisons of the longitudes of these\r\nthree points, Berenice Temple, St. John’s Peak, and Halaib Fort,\r\nwe obtain much more wide divergences, as is only to be expected\r\nfrom the fact that the Admiralty and “Pola” determinations were\r\nmade by transport of chronometers from Suez, which is over 500 miles\r\ndistant from Halaib.\r\n\r\nFor Berenice Temple the Admiralty longitude (obtained by applying the\r\nscaled reduction of − 40″ to the observed longitude 35° 29′\r\n11″ at the observation point) is 35° 28′ 31″. Lieut. Koss’s\r\ntransport of chronometers from Suez _via_ Jidda leads to a longitude\r\nof 33° 30′ 20″ for his observation point, which lies 54″ east\r\nof the temple; thus the “Pola” longitude for the temple is 35°\r\n29′ 26″. My triangulation gives 35° 28′ 26″, thus agreeing\r\nvery nearly with the Admiralty value and differing by exactly 1′\r\nfrom the value found by Lieut. Koss.\r\n\r\nFor St. John’s Peak, the longitude scaled from the Admiralty\r\nChart is 36° 10′ 20″. The observations of Lieut. Koss lead to\r\na longitude of 36° 12′ 38″ for his observation point, which is\r\nabout 35″ west of the peak; thus the “Pola” longitude for the\r\npeak is 36° 13′ 13″. My triangulation gives 36° 11′ 42″,\r\nbeing thus between the Admiralty and “Pola” values.\r\n\r\nFor Halaib Fort, the Admiralty longitude is 36° 37′ 3″,\r\nwhile Lieut. Koss’s figures lead to the value 36° 40′ 38″;\r\nmy triangulation gives 36° 38′ 56″, thus again showing a value\r\nbetween the two marine determinations.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the longitudes obtained for the three points, we have:—\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n                       | Berenice  |St. John’s |Halaib Fort.\r\n                       |  Temple.  |   Peak.   |\r\n                       +-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n   Admiralty Chart     |35° 28′ 31″|36° 10′ 20″|36° 37′  3″\r\n                       |           |           |\r\n   “Pola” Expedition   |35° 29′ 26″|36° 13′ 13″|36° 40′ 38″\r\n                       |           |           |\r\n   Ball (Triangulation)|35° 28′ 26″|36° 11′ 42″|36° 38′ 56″\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nThere can, of course, be no doubt of the immensely greater accuracy\r\nof the triangulation method of determining longitude as compared\r\nwith that of chronometer transport in voyages lasting for months,\r\nno matter how many chronometers are carried nor what care is\r\ntaken in the work. The above differences of longitude are small\r\nwhen one considers that no absolute control of the chronometer of\r\nthe “Pola” expedition was obtained from October 23, 1895, when\r\nthe ship left Suez, till its return to the same port on January 27,\r\n1896. If we examine the difference of longitude between points fairly\r\nclose together, we find rather better agreement between chronometers\r\nand triangulation. Thus, for instance, between Berenice and Halaib,\r\na six days’ voyage, we have:—\r\n\r\n  --------------------+-------------+--------------\r\n                      |Longitude by |Longitude by\r\n                      |Chronometers |Triangulation\r\n                      |   (Koss).   |   (Ball).\r\n                      +-------------+--------------\r\n   Halaib Fort        | 36° 40′ 38″ | 36° 38′ 56″\r\n                      |             |\r\n   Berenice Temple    | 35° 29′ 26″ | 35° 28′ 26″\r\n                      +-------------+--------------\r\n           Difference |  1° 11′ 12″ |  1° 10′ 30″\r\n  --------------------+-------------+--------------\r\n\r\nshowing an error of only 42″, or about three seconds of time in\r\nthe six days.\r\n\r\nThe triangulation-positions:—\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-------------+--------------\r\n                    | Latitude N. | Longitude E.\r\n                    +-------------+--------------\r\n   Berenice Temple  | 23° 54′ 39″ | 35° 28′ 26″\r\n                    |             |\r\n   St. John’s Peak  | 23° 36′ 16″ | 36° 11′ 42″\r\n                    |             |\r\n   Halaib Fort      | 22° 13′ 25″ | 36° 38′ 56″\r\n  ------------------+-------------+--------------\r\n\r\nmay therefore be taken as practically correct, and the three points\r\nmay be used as well-determined positions both for further discussion\r\nof the “Pola” results and in further surveying expeditions in\r\nthe Red Sea.[75]\r\n\r\n\r\n               =Detail Surveying along Lines of March.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAll detail visible along lines of march from camp to camp was recorded\r\non plane-table sheets on a scale of 1:100,000. The usual process\r\nwas as follows: The plane-table sheet was first provided with a\r\ngraticule at 10′ intervals of latitude and longitude, and all the\r\ntriangulation points previously fixed within the area covered by the\r\nsheet were marked in their computed places. Stations were chosen along\r\nthe route at an average distance apart of two or three kilometres,\r\nthe most commanding hills being selected, and the positions of these\r\nwere found by plane-table re-section from three or more triangulation\r\npoints. The compass, being frequently disturbed by magnetic rocks,[76]\r\nwas only used to get a first approximation to the true orientation\r\nof the table. The plane-table station having been fixed on the map,\r\ntacheometric readings were taken to all conspicuous points easy of\r\naccess within a radius of about two kilometres, and plotted at their\r\nmeasured distances along the directions given by the alidade.\r\n\r\nIn the telemetric measurements a 5-inch tacheometer was used side\r\nby side with the plane-table, and two staff-men were employed. As\r\nthe scale of the map was small, the sights were much longer than is\r\nusual in tacheometry, and the maximum distance of 800 metres directly\r\nreadable by the four-metre staves employed was generally exceeded. For\r\nthe long distance readings, where the distance between two cross-wires\r\nsubtended more than the length of the staff, I devised the following\r\nprocess. Bringing the centre wire to the base of the staff, a reading\r\nof the vertical circle was taken; next, by the tangent-screw, the\r\nwire was brought to the top of the staff, and a second reading of the\r\nvertical circle was taken, the difference giving the angle subtended\r\nby the four-metre staff. It is clear that the distance is as many\r\ntimes greater than 800 metres, as the angle subtended is less than\r\n17′ of arc, and the distance is thus found by simple proportion.\r\n\r\nIn the case of very long sights, even this method failed, because\r\nthe circle could only be read to half-minutes, which was too coarse\r\na graduation to give a good result, and in these cases the method\r\nused was one of repetition. The wire being brought to the base of the\r\nstaff as before, and a first reading of the vertical circle taken,\r\nthe wire was brought to the top of the staff by the tangent screw,\r\nthen to the bottom again by altering the levelling screws slightly,\r\nagain to the top by the tangent screw, and so on, three or four times,\r\nand then a second reading was taken on the vertical circle. The slight\r\nalteration of level had no sensible influence on the result, and it\r\nis obvious that by automatically summing up, say, four intercepts in\r\nthis way, a very much more accurate value of the subtense angle was\r\nobtained than was possible from a single measurement. In practice\r\nI found it was best to carry in the waistcoat pocket a card giving\r\nthe distance corresponding to any number of minutes of difference of\r\nreading after a four-fold repetition, and it was quite practicable to\r\nmeasure up to three kilometres of distance within one hundred metres\r\nof the truth; as this only represented a millimetre on the sheet, and\r\nas, moreover, errors were not cumulative, owing to the independent\r\nfixation of each successive station by re-section, the accuracy was\r\nall that could be desired, and the rapidity of measurement was very\r\ngreat. In this long distance type of tacheometry, finely graduated\r\nstaves were of no use; the form of staff employed was a broad-faced\r\none, fifteen centimetres wide, bearing fifty-centimetre divisions\r\npainted alternately black and white right across the whole breadth\r\nof the staff.[77]\r\n\r\nAn average of about six or eight conspicuous points having been\r\ntelemetrically fixed from a station, the detail was sketched in around\r\nthem, and other more distant points were at the same time fixed by\r\nplane-table intersections from several stations. At the stations the\r\npencil sketching of relief was by form-lines which were subsequently\r\nreplaced by hachure-rendering when inking up the sheets in camp.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when a high hill-station was employed overlooking a\r\nlong wadi, time was saved by reading only two distances, both in the\r\nsame wadi, one very near to the station and the other two or three\r\nkilometres away, at the same time observing the depression-angles\r\nto these points. The slope of the wadi being found in this way, the\r\ndepression-angles to intermediate points gave the distances of such\r\npoints without the necessity of staff reading at the intermediate\r\npoints at all. Thus, suppose the near point was close under the\r\nstation, with a distance of 500 metres and a depression-angle of 18°,\r\nwhile the remote point up the wadi had a distance of three kilometres\r\nand a depression-angle of 2° 30′. By means of a slide rule or\r\nthree-figure logarithms, the near point was found to be 163 metres\r\nbelow the station, and the distant one 130 metres. A point in the\r\nwadi estimated roughly as half way between the two would be about 146\r\nmetres below the station; so that if the observed depression-angle to\r\nit was, say, 4° 40′, its distance would be 146/(_tan_ 4° 40′),\r\nor 1·8 kilometres. Any possible error of preliminary estimation of\r\nthe distance in order to find the level would be without sensible\r\ninfluence on the resulting true distance.\r\n\r\nThe process of traversing between stations was seldom resorted to,\r\nas the method of fixing stations by re-section from triangulation\r\npoints is much more accurate (the errors not being cumulative)\r\nbesides being more rapid. But in certain tortuous cañon-like wadis,\r\nwhere great and time-consuming climbs would have had to be undertaken\r\nin order to see any triangulation points, the method of traversing\r\nwith the tacheometer had to be employed.\r\n\r\nLevels along the line of march were measured trigonometrically\r\nwhenever possible; the vertical angles to one or more triangulation\r\npoints being read with the tacheometer, and the distances scaled off\r\nthe map, the differences of height, corrected for refraction, were\r\nfound by the slide rule in the same manner as in the triangulation\r\nalready described. Heights of passes and camps whence no triangulation\r\npoints were visible were determined by barometer-comparisons between\r\nthem and points of precisely determined altitude.\r\n\r\nNames of places were written down by the guides in Arabic characters\r\non the spot where they were ascertained, and transliterated on the\r\nEgyptian Government system for insertion in the map. Most of the\r\nplace-names were checked by getting the guides to give them from\r\nseveral different stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n        =Detail Surveying at Occupied Triangulation Stations.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was generally necessary to remain for at least a week on the\r\nmountain summits which formed the main triangulation stations,\r\nfor only on about one day in seven was the air clear enough for\r\nsighting the beacons on the longer lines. Occasionally the entire\r\nlandscape was blotted out for ten or more consecutive days by clouds\r\nsurrounding the summit, while at other times it was possible to see\r\nonly for a limited distance round the station owing to haze. Such\r\ntimes were made use of to map all visible detail within a moderate\r\nrange (say within a radius of twelve kilometres) round the station.\r\n\r\nIn this work the first stage was to find a small base, one end\r\nof which was the station itself. Usually a minor peak of the same\r\nrange, 500 to 1,000 metres away from the station, was fairly easily\r\naccessible, and was chosen for the other end of the base. The six-inch\r\ntheodolite being at the main station, the five-inch tacheometer was\r\nset up at the auxiliary station, and all noteworthy hill tops, as well\r\nas a few points along each main line of drainage, were triangulated\r\noff this small base. The length of the base was found by including\r\none or two main triangulation points in the round of angles. These\r\nminor triangles were conveniently reduced by the slide rule, and the\r\npoints plotted at once on the plane-table by means of the alidade\r\nand the calculated distances. The base being short, it was necessary\r\nto observe to fine marks; cracks in the rocks, and the droppings\r\nof birds on the peaks, and the centres of selected tree trunks in\r\nthe wadis, were usually chosen. The levels of these minor points\r\nwere determined by vertical angulation in the ordinary way. Usually\r\nabout thirty points were thus fixed round each high station. Once a\r\nnumber of points were fixed in the wadis, the levels of these gave\r\nthe slope, and the difference of height between any other parts of\r\nthe wadis and the station could be estimated to within a few metres by\r\nmeans of the knowledge thus obtained. A sketch being now made of the\r\nwadis, which appeared spread out almost like a map below the station,\r\na hundred or more points along them were selected, and their depths\r\nbelow the station being very approximately known from the wadi slope,\r\ntheir distances were found by observing depression angles to them\r\nand reducing the vertical triangle by means of the slide rule on\r\nthe spot. In all, therefore, measurements were usually made of the\r\ndistances of from 100 to 200 conspicuous points in the area round\r\nthe station, and when these were plotted with the alidade on the\r\nplane-table sheet it was not difficult to sketch in all the detail\r\nwith considerable accuracy. Usually it was not possible to see all\r\nround the mountain from the station itself, so that subsidiary\r\nplane-table stations near the main one were necessary. In other\r\ncases more than one small base was measured in order to get good\r\nangles to various points by the minor triangulation.\r\n\r\nBy the combined use of minor triangulation for peaks, and vertical\r\nangulation for points situated along drainage lines, it was found\r\nthat far more sketching could be done in a few days at a main station\r\nthan would have been possible in the same time by tacheometric work\r\non the lower ground, and that of greater accuracy. More than half\r\nof the entire detail sketching was in fact done at the main stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =Survey of the Coast-line.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier portion of the work, _i.e._, north of latitude 24°,\r\nthe work on the coast-line was confined to the fixation of prominent\r\npoints such as spurs and tips of islands. Some of these were fixed\r\nas intersected points during the triangulation, while others were\r\ndetermined by observing the depression angle and azimuth to them from\r\ntrigonometrical stations of known altitude. In this latter method,\r\ntaking the mean coefficient of refraction as 0·13, the formula[78]\r\nemployed was\r\n\r\n\r\n  _d_ = 35·497 (θ − √{θ² − 11621 _h_})\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere _d_ = distance in metres, θ = depression angle in seconds,\r\nand _h_ = altitude of station in metres. This formula is rather\r\ntedious to work out, though the work is relatively not so great if\r\na number of points are to be calculated from observations at the\r\nsame station. Prominent points having been fixed in this way, the\r\ncoast-line north of 24° was sketched in from the Admiralty Chart,\r\nadjusting the longitude to fit the points fixed.\r\n\r\nIt was sometimes a little difficult, however, to identify the fixed\r\npoints on the existing charts, and hence I tried to find some\r\nprocess of surveying the entire remaining coast-line _de novo_\r\nin detail. Traversing along the coast was placed out of question\r\nby the great expenditure of time and money which it would have\r\nentailed. Eventually I was led to devise a new method, by which long\r\nstretches of coast-line could be mapped by polar co-ordinates from\r\nmountain stations with great speed and accuracy. The directions of\r\na series of points sufficiently close together along the coast were\r\ntaken by theodolite, and the depression angles simultaneously observed\r\nwith the vertical circle. Then, instead of computing the distances to\r\nthe points, they were plotted by a special scale graduated directly\r\nin angles of dip; by thus doing away with all calculation at the\r\nstation, it was possible to lay down the points on the chart as\r\nfast as the observations could be taken, usually at the rate of\r\nfour or five points a minute, and it was frequently possible to\r\nmap thirty kilometres or more of coast-line in an hour with great\r\naccuracy. As I have given a full account of this new method in\r\na separate publication,[79] I shall not go into it further here,\r\nbut would refer those interested to the publication just mentioned.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the new method the entire coast-line from just north\r\nof Ras Benas southwards to the parallel of 22°, a distance of over\r\n200 miles, was mapped in detail on the 100,000 scale. I had frequent\r\nopportunities of testing the accuracy of the delineation of the coast,\r\nboth by mapping the same stretch from two widely-distant stations of\r\ndifferent heights, and by subsequently surveying small portions of\r\nthe coast directly by plane-table and tacheometer from triangulation\r\npoints on or near the coast; and in all cases I found the accuracy\r\nto be very high, the differences found rarely exceeding the thickness\r\nof a line on the map. The tides in the Red Sea are so small in range\r\n(generally only about a metre) that variations of sea-level were\r\npractically negligible during the operations. Bearing in mind the\r\ngreat difficulties attending the survey of so inhospitable a coast\r\nby the ordinary method of traversing, I believe the resulting outline\r\nof the coast on my maps is very much more correct than that shown on\r\nany previous charts. An accurate delineation of the coast-line in\r\nthis region is of course chiefly of value as indicating the extent\r\nof land; it is of little importance to the navigator, for whom the\r\npositions of the outlying dangerous reefs, mapped by the Admiralty\r\nsurveyors, are far more important.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Location of the Administrative Boundary between Egypt and the Sudan.=\r\n\r\n\r\nBy an Arrêté of the Ministry of Interior issued in 1902 it was\r\nenacted that the boundary between the administrative divisions of\r\nEgypt and the Sudan should be as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\nCommencing at Bir Shalatein on the coast of the Red Sea, the limit\r\nruns to Bir Meneiga, thence to Gebel Niqrub, thence to Gebel Um el\r\nTiur and to Deiga. From Deiga the line continues to Bir Esmet Omar,\r\nthence to Gebel Bartazuga, and finally to the Nile at Korosko.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis frontier was defined after a commission had sat, at the Mudiria\r\nof Aswân, to make enquiries as to the vested rights of the Bedouin\r\ntribes, the guiding principle being that all Bisharin tribes should\r\nbe under Sudan administration, and all Ababda tribes (with one\r\nexception) under the Government of Egypt. A map accompanied the\r\ndecision, but was of a very rough character, and the positions of\r\nthe points specified were not known within several miles.\r\n\r\nPart of my work comprised the precise fixation of the points specified\r\nin the Arrêté, with a view to laying down the boundary accurately\r\non a map. As was natural in the case of a boundary settled without\r\ncareful reference to the ground, certain difficulties arose in the\r\nlocation. In the first place, there are two distinct Gebels Niqrub,\r\nand two distinct Gebels Um el Tiur. I assumed the higher mountain of\r\neach pair to be the one indicated. Secondly, the precise point of the\r\nmountain was unspecified; I assumed the highest peak to be the point\r\nreferred to. Thirdly, the text of the Arrêté disagrees with the\r\nmap accompanying it, in that the map shows the line curved to pass\r\nclose to Gebel Mishbih, which is not mentioned in the Arrêté. I\r\nassumed the text of the order to be determinative, and that between\r\nthe points specified the limit followed great circles on the globe,\r\n_i.e._, practically straight lines on the map. The locality called\r\nDeiga was not visited, and can only be approximately fixed; it\r\nis said by guides to be a narrow road near Gebel Muqsim, of which\r\nmountain several peaks were fixed by triangulation.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the positions found for the various points\r\nalong the boundary from the sea to the meridian of 34° (1) from my\r\nsurvey operations, and (2) as scaled from the map accompanying the\r\nMinisterial Arrêté. A comparison of the two sets of positions will\r\nshow how much the survey has added to our knowledge of the geography\r\nof this part of the desert.\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-----------------------+------------------------\r\n                     |      Latitude N.      |      Longitude E.\r\n        Point.       +-----------------------+------------------------\r\n                     |  From my  |   From    |  From my  |   From\r\n                     |  Survey.  |Arrêté Map.|  Survey.  |Arrêté Map.\r\n  -------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n   Bir Shalatein     |23°  8′  5″|22° 39′  0″|35° 36′ 28″|36°  2′ 30″\r\n                     |           |           |           |\r\n   Bir Meneiga       |22° 47′  8″|22° 41′ 30″|35° 12′ 20″|35°  2′ 30″\r\n                     |           |           |           |\r\n   Gebel Niqrub (El  |22° 51′ 29″|22° 48′  0″|34° 56′ 48″|34° 51′  0″\r\n   Foqani)           |           |           |           |\r\n                     |           |           |           |\r\n   Gebel Um el Tiur  |22° 17′ 54″|22° 18′ 30″|34° 41′  1″|34° 32′  0″\r\n   (El Foqani)       |           |           |           |\r\n                     |           |           |           |\r\n   Deiga (approx.)   |22° 10′  0″|22°  9′  0″|34°  1′  0″|34°  3′  0″\r\n  -------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =Variation of the Compass.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCareful observations were made of the variation of the compass at\r\nthree stations, _viz._, Berenice Temple, Abu Saafa Springs, and near\r\nHalaib Fort,[80] these three points being selected as being well-known\r\nplaces and at the same time likely to be free from local magnetic\r\ndisturbance. Berenice is on the coast-plain where only coral and\r\nsand occur; Abu Saafa is in a sandstone district about 100 kilometres\r\nsouth-west of Berenice, and Halaib is on the calcareous and gypseous\r\nrocks of the coast about 220 kilometres south-east of Abu Saafa.\r\n\r\nThe instrument used was a five-inch theodolite fitted with a good\r\ntrough compass. A lens was used to bring the needle accurately to\r\nzero, and the sun or a star was employed to find the true meridian. In\r\neach case several observations, each with an independent setting\r\nof the needle, were made, and the mean taken. The values obtained\r\nwere:—\r\n\r\n  -------------------+---------------------------+------------------\r\n        Place.       |      Date and Time.       |Compass-Variation\r\n                     |                           |      West.\r\n  -------------------+---------------------------+------------------\r\n   Berenice Temple   |January 6, 1907, 5·30 p.m. |     2° 44′\r\n                     |                           |\r\n   Abu Saafa Springs |October 25, 1907, 4 p.m.   |     2° 37′\r\n                     |                           |\r\n   Near Halaib Fort  |May 7, 1908, 10 a.m.       |     2° 18′\r\n  -------------------+---------------------------+------------------\r\n\r\nIn order to find to what degree of accuracy the results of these\r\ndeterminations might be relied on, the instrument used was tested\r\nagainst the Kew magnetometer at the Khedivial Observatory, Helwân,\r\nafter the completion of the work. Three observations for the\r\ndeclination at Helwân gave the westerly variation as\r\n\r\n         2° 41′·2\r\n\r\n         2° 58′·8\r\n\r\n         2° 55′·0\r\n         --------\r\n  Mean   2° 55′·0\r\n         --------\r\n\r\nwhile the true declination as given by the Kew magnetometer at the\r\nsame time was 2° 52′ 5″. Thus it appears reasonable to believe\r\nthe observed values to be within about 5′ of the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is rather curious to note that the declination observed at Abu\r\nSaafa is less than that at Berenice, which lies further east, even\r\nif allowance is made for the secular change in the interval. The\r\ndifference from what one would expect is, however, possibly owing to\r\nerrors of observation of the magnitude above-mentioned, or it may be\r\ndue to a slight local influence of magnetic rocks underground at Abu\r\nSaafa, where the ground is near to the base of the Nubian sandstone\r\nbeds, which rest presumably on eruptive and metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the observations of declination at\r\nBerenice and Halaib with those recorded by ROSSLER[81] at the same\r\nplaces in 1895. Thus we have:—\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n              Berenice.             |           Mersa Halaib.\r\n  ------------------------+---------+-----------------------+----------\r\n   Rossler, Nov. 27, 1895 |3° 54′   |Rossler, Nov. 18, 1895 |3° 36′\r\n                          |         |                       |\r\n   Ball, Jan. 6, 1907     |2° 44′   |Ball, May 7, 1908      |2° 18′\r\n                          +---------+                       +----------\r\n      Diff. in  11·1 years|1° 10′   |    Diff. in 12·5 years|1° 18′\r\n                          |         |                       |\r\n           Yearly decrease|    6′·3 |        Yearly decrease|    6′·3\r\n  ------------------------+---------+-----------------------+----------\r\n\r\nWe thus arrive at a yearly secular diminution of declination of\r\n6′ 3″, confirming the value arrived at by Mr. KEELING[82] for\r\nthe rate of secular change in the Red Sea area from a comparison of\r\nother observations. It may be therefore concluded that the rate of\r\n3′ per annum given in the “Admiralty Pilot”[83] is only about\r\nhalf the true value.\r\n\r\nTravellers in the Eastern Desert should exercise care in the reliance\r\nthey place on compass bearings. Bearings taken with a compass are\r\ngenerally normal in granite and sandstone country; but wherever dark\r\nigneous and metamorphic rocks abound, disturbances are likely to\r\noccur. Local deviations of 5° to 10° are quite common, and in some\r\nserpentine areas even 40° of disturbance may be observed. In some\r\nplaces, one can deflect the needle through a large angle by means\r\nof a fragment of the rock no larger than a nut, so rich are some of\r\nthe basic rocks in magnetic minerals. Some lumps of rock even show\r\nstrong polarity, attracting or repelling the north pole of the needle\r\naccording as one part or another of the lump is presented to it.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: This measurement was made in conjunction with\r\nMessrs. Villiers Stuart, Charteris Stewart, and Clarke.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: The logarithms A′, B, and C are taken from\r\nMerriman’s _Precise Surveying and Geodesy_, 1899, 255. p.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: CHAUVENET (_Spherical and Practical Astronomy_, Vol. I,\r\np. 283) shows that when both latitude and time are required, the three\r\nstars should differ in azimuth by 120° to give the most accurate\r\nresults. But when only the latitude is required the stars are best\r\nselected near to the meridian north and south of the zenith. This\r\nis evident by considering that if two stars could be observed to\r\nculminate at the same altitude on opposite sides of the zenith,\r\nthe latitude would be precisely determined independently of any\r\nreference to time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: I am indebted to Mr. B. H. Wade, of the Survey\r\nDepartment, for drawing my attention to this method.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The signs of the coefficients follow from those of\r\nthe trigonometrical functions; but it is useful to remember that the\r\ncoefficient of _d_φ is + or − according as the star is north or\r\nsouth, while that of _dT_ is + or − according as the star is east\r\nor west of the meridian.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: CHAUVENET, _Astronomy_, Vol. I, p. 283.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: In this connexion it is interesting to note that as the\r\ngeneral level of the country to the south of Gebel Um Heshenib is some\r\n250 metres higher than that to the north of it, the plumb-line will\r\nbe deflected to the south by local attraction, thus explaining why\r\nthe observed latitude at that station exceeds by so much the value\r\ncalculated from the triangulation. Berenice temple, on the other\r\nhand, is on a coast-plain remote from mountains, and the observed\r\nlatitude agrees closely with the calculated one.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: The method of observation and reduction was that usually\r\ndescribed in text books of field astronomy. _See_, for instance,\r\nMichie and Harlow’s _Practical Astronomy_, 1902, pp. 161-168,\r\nand the tables on pp. 198-201 of the same work.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: The Sudan Survey’s positions are all south-east of\r\nthose which I obtained for the same points.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: For calculations of this type and for tacheometric\r\nand other reductions in the field, the Nessler “Universal” slide\r\nrule, which is specially designed for surveyors, was found to be a\r\nmost valuable time-saver. _See_ my paper in the _Cairo Scientific\r\nJournal_, “On the Use of the Slide-rule in Surveying,” Dec. 1907.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: A careful discussion which I have recently undertaken\r\nof the entire series of reciprocal observations made during the three\r\nseasons’ work shows that _k_ varies according to the altitude of\r\nthe lines and according as the lines pass over land or sea. I hope\r\nlater to publish a separate account of this discussion, which has an\r\nimportant bearing on the vertical distribution of temperature in the\r\nair. But I may here state that for overland lines the formula _k_ =\r\n0·1503 + 0·0000164 (_h_ − 830), where _h_ is the mean altitude\r\nof the line in metres, gives a good agreement with the observations;\r\nwhile on oversea lines at altitudes above 100 metres _k_ is always\r\nvery near to 0·135. The errors in the resulting altitudes of\r\nintersected points due to the uniform employment of _k_ = 0·13,\r\nare very trifling, and will seldom exceed one or two metres; for\r\nexample, at a distance of thirty kilometres the substitution of _k_\r\n= 0·16 for _k_ = 0·13 will only change the altitude by two metres.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: This number 1210 represents the significant figures\r\nof √{106·84}, 6·84 metres being the correction given by (1 −\r\n_k_)/2_r_ _d_² for a distance of ten kilometres.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _Berichte der Commission für Oceanographische\r\nForschungen_, Sechste Reihe, Wien, 1898, pp. 13, 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: In particular, the adoption of the above three\r\nlongitudes as of equal accuracy with Suez will lead to a better\r\nlongitude for Jidda. The longitude of Jidda is at present fixed only\r\nby chronometer transport from Suez, a distance of some 650 miles; but\r\nby regarding Halaib as a fixed point the distance of comparison can\r\nbe reduced to 150 miles. The data for this revision of the longitude\r\nof Jidda already exist in the Reports of the “Pola” expedition,\r\nand the discussion is certainly worth undertaking before any future\r\nsurveys are conducted in the central portion of the Red Sea.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: The disturbance of the needle was of course most\r\nfrequent in the areas where dark igneous and metamorphic rocks\r\nprevailed; in these regions disturbances of 10° were very frequent,\r\nand in some cases, as for example on the serpentine deposits of\r\nSikait, as much as 40° was noticed. In the sandstone areas no\r\ndisturbances were marked.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: I have given a somewhat fuller account of this\r\nprocess in a little paper on “Long-distance Tacheometry.” _Cairo\r\nScientific Journal_, Vol. IV, February 1910.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: JORDAN, _Handbuch der Vermessungskunde_.

The following scheme shows the relations of the principal\r\ntributaries, important feeders of the tributaries themselves being\r\nindicated in (brackets):—\r\n\r\n               { Wadi Dweig.\r\n               {\r\n  WADI SHAIT   { Wadi Muelih (Wadi Gerf, Rod el Ligah, Wadi Sibrit).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Hamish.\r\n\r\n               { Wadi Hilgit (Wadi Um Hasidok, Wadi Um el Tiur).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Egat.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi el Anbat.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Abarun.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Um Daba.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Abu Argub.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Safihat.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Um Sellim.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Medsus.\r\n               {\r\n  WADI KHARIT  { Wadi Abu Gurdi.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Elemikan (Rod el Geneina).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Abu Hashim.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Helie.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Abu Hamamid (Wadi Marasani, Wadi el Sheikh).\r\n               {\r\n               { Rod el Kharuf (Wadi Abu Had).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Khashab (Wadi Metawit, Wadi Antar).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Garara (Wadi el Kreim, Wadi Timsah, Wadi Ghadrib,\r\n               { Wadi Abu Hashim, Wadi Abu Homur).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Natash.\r\n\r\n               { Wadi Himeitra.\r\n               {\r\n               { Miti Kwan (Wadi Duag, Wadi Kirir, Wadi Merau, Wadi\r\n               { Miaus).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Dageina.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Alfawi.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Egat (Wadi Hiteib).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Hateib (Wadi Suhin).\r\n               {\r\n  WADI ALAQI   { Wadi Guqub.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Um Teneideb.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Defeit (Wadi Sarid, Wadi Dauriai, Wadi Hamida,\r\n               { Wadi Bint el Feqoh, Wadi Anweiyib, Wadi Meladoyeb, Rod\r\n               { Hawanin, Wadi Bagharid).\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Eleifat.\r\n               {\r\n               { Wadi Seiga (Wadi Um Derera, Wadi Abu Had, Wadi Um\r\n               { Gholqa).\r\n\r\nMost of the drainage-lines mentioned in the description will be found\r\nmarked on the orographical map which forms Plate I; but the scale\r\nof that map is too small for all the minor feeders to be indicated\r\nwith clearness.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wadi Shait=, an important main trunk wadi draining westwards to the\r\nNile, originates at the west foot of Gebel Ras Shait, in lat. 24°\r\n50′, long. 34° 31′, and joins the Nile Valley a little to\r\nthe north of Kom Ombo. It has a total length of very nearly 200\r\nkilometres, and an average fall of three metres per kilometre. The\r\nfall is much more rapid in the upper reaches than lower down; in the\r\nfirst fifty-five kilometres of its length, from the foot of Gebel\r\nRas Shait to Bir Um Gubur, the fall is 340 metres, or an average\r\ngradient of six metres per kilometre, while from Bir Um Gubur, for\r\nthe remaining 140 kilometres of its course, its fall is only 250\r\nmetres, or an average gradient of less than two metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\nThe head of Wadi Shait is formed by the union of a number of\r\ndrainage channels from a kind of _cul-de-sac_ formed by Gebels\r\nMigif, Ras Shait, and Mudergeg, where it is separated from the heads\r\nof Wadi Gerf and Wadi Hafafit by flat sandy divides. Passing in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction to the west of Gebel Migif and Gebel Dweig,\r\nit receives as a tributary =Wadi Dweig= (in which are the ruins of an\r\nancient station) on the left. Taking thence a more westerly course it\r\ntraverses more open country, and then narrows among hills north-west\r\nof the remarkable peak of Gebel Abu Khrug. At a bend further on is\r\n=Bir Murra=, a shallow well sunk in the alluvium of the wadi floor\r\nat the foot of a serpentine scarp; the water here (as the name of\r\nthe well indicates) is very bitter, and is generally drunk only by\r\ncamels. After passing Bir Murra, the wadi turns south-west, then\r\ncurves again near =Bir Um Gubur=, about three kilometres south-east\r\nof Gebel Sufra, and about twelve kilometres below Bir Murra. Bir Um\r\nGubur is a shaft about two and a half metres diameter, sunk about\r\neight metres deep in the alluvium of the wadi; it was yielding good\r\nsupplies of excellent water in 1906. About ten kilometres below Bir\r\nUm Gubur, =Wadi Hamish= joins Wadi Shait from the north-east. In the\r\nremainder of the course of Wadi Shait to the Nile, the principal\r\nwater source is =Bir Heliwat=,[84] about ten kilometres below the\r\npoint of influx of Wadi Hamish, and the chief tributary wadis are\r\nMuelih, Beza, and Midrik, all of which join it from the north-east.\r\n\r\nThe upper portions of Wadi Shait contain a fair abundance of trees\r\nand scrub, but the lower parts are sandy arid wastes.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Muelih= originates in the mountain called Gebel Iteima,\r\nin lat. 25° 8′. For about sixteen kilometres its course lies\r\nill-defined over a sandy plain with scattered low hills, to Erf el\r\nFahid, a remarkable east and west quartz ridge nearly two kilometres\r\nlong rising among crushed diorites and schists to a height of 579\r\nmetres above sea, or ninety-five metres above the wadi, in lat. 25°\r\n0′. After passing Erf el Fahid, the course of the wadi changes to\r\nsouth-west, and gradually becomes more enclosed by low hills. The\r\nfirst hills passed on the right are high ridges formed by great\r\nquartz veins striking south-west, at the foot of which the wadi\r\nforms a plain nearly a kilometre broad, with low hills and mounds\r\nof dark gneisses and schists on the left. At ten kilometres below\r\nErf el Fahid, on the left of the wadi, is a horse-shoe shaped hill\r\nof aplite called Marwot Rod el Ligaia, to the north and south of\r\nwhich are other hills penetrated by networks of quartz veins. Two\r\nkilometres further on, a band of diorite gneiss cuts across the wadi,\r\nwhich then commences to narrow in among hills of crushed diorites,\r\ngrey gneisses, and schists, with many dykes of porphyrite and\r\nfelsite. These hills become progressively higher as one descends,\r\nand near the meridian of 34° the wadi curves round the foot of Gebel\r\nMuelih, a great bare white granite boss rising through darker rocks to\r\na height of 330 metres above the wadi, or 707 metres above sea. Just\r\nafter passing Gebel Muelih the wadi, which has here a width of only\r\nsome 200 metres, turns south-west again. At this turn, nearly in\r\nthe centre of the wadi floor, is =Bir Muelih=, an excavation about\r\nsix metres deep in the alluvium, yielding very salt water drinkable\r\nonly by camels. North-east of the well a track strikes over the hills\r\ntowards Dungash mine. From Bir Muelih the wadi continues in a roughly\r\nsouth-west direction past Bir Samut (well about one kilometre north\r\nof Wadi Muelih) and then takes a more southerly course draining into\r\nWadi Shait in longitude 33° 46′.\r\n\r\nThe wadi floor falls from a level of 484 metres near Erf el Fahid\r\nto 375 metres at Bir Muelih, the length of the wadi between the two\r\nplaces being about twenty-seven kilometres; this gives an average\r\nfall of about four metres per kilometre; the actual gradient varies\r\nfrom about two metres per kilometre in the broader portions to over\r\nsix metres per kilometre in the more enclosed parts of the wadi.\r\n\r\nThe upper parts of Wadi Muelih are barren and sandy, but the lower\r\nportions contain a fair amount of vegetation. The principal feeders\r\nof Wadi Muelih are Wadi Gerf, which enters by several openings on\r\nthe left above Gebel Muelih, Wadi Samut, entering on the right\r\nin long. 33° 54′, and Wadi Sibrit, entering on the left in\r\nlong. 33° 50′.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Gerf= is the collective name given to a number of rather\r\ncomplicated drainage channels forming tributaries to Wadi Muelih. The\r\nprincipal heads are to the east and west of Gebel Nugrus. The eastern\r\nhead is called =Wadi Hangalia=; it commences at about an altitude\r\nof 811 metres due east of the highest point of Gebel Nugrus, at a\r\ndifficult pass leading over the main watershed to Wadi el Nom, and\r\ncurves round the north spurs of Gebel Nugrus to join the western\r\nhead. In the Wadi Hangalia are some old ruins of a mining camp,\r\nand also some recent prospecting workings and a well giving a poor\r\nsupply of water. The Western head of Wadi Gerf commences in nearly\r\nlevel ground on the main divide west of Gebel Nugrus, at an altitude\r\nof 691 metres. These two main heads unite close to the east of Gebel\r\nRas Shait, whence Wadi Gerf courses about north-west through low\r\nhills. A third head is in lat. 24° 52′, at a pass leading into\r\nWadi Um Khariga. A fourth, called =Rod el Atut=, takes the drainage\r\nfrom all sides of the conspicuous black cone of Gebel Atut. A fifth,\r\ncalled =Rod Um el Farag=, drains from the mass of moderately high\r\nhills further west called Um el Huetat; these hills contain some old\r\nmines, chiefly in talc schists. The drainages from these various heads\r\nall eventually take a west-south-west course among low hills and over\r\na sandy plain and enter Wadi Muelih by several openings near longitude\r\n34°. Minor tributaries are =Wadi Abu Seyal= and =Wadi Um Seyal=,\r\nsouth-east of Gebel Atut, =Rod el Ligaia=, in longitude 34° 10′;\r\nand =Rod el Ligah=, in latitude 24° 50′.\r\n\r\nThe principal hills of the plain over which Wadi Gerf and its\r\ntributaries run their course are some very remarkable small black\r\npeaks collectively called Khusa el Faraon, a light coloured hill\r\ncalled Marwot Rod el Ligah, and a ridge called Erf el Sagur; these\r\ntwo last rise to 514 and 523 metres above sea-level respectively.\r\n\r\nWadi Gerf possesses a fair amount of vegetation, except where it\r\nmeanders over the sandy plains; in the tributaries Wadi Um Seyal\r\nand Wadi Abu Seyal acacia trees are specially numerous.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Sibrit= is a long narrow wadi following a course somewhat south\r\nof west, originating to the west of Gebel Mudergeg and joining Wadi\r\nMuelih in longitude 33° 50′. It possesses many trees and a good\r\nwell, =Bir Sibrit=. This latter is an excavation in the wadi floor,\r\nin longitude 33° 58′; it is said to yield a constant supply. In\r\nthe spring of 1906 I found the water was at a depth of eight metres\r\nbelow the surface, and of good quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wadi Kharit=, one of the greatest trunk wadis of Egypt, has its\r\nprincipal head at Gebel Ras el Kharit, on the main watershed\r\nin latitude 14° 10′ and longitude 35°. Pursuing a course\r\nthe prevailing direction of which is a little north of west,\r\nand collecting the drainage from numerous great wadis on its way,\r\nit debouches on the Kom Ombo plain and reaches the Nile at the same\r\npoint as another great wadi, Shait, in latitude 24° 35′. The length\r\nof the main channel is over 260 kilometres, and of its tributaries\r\nprobably more than twenty times as great. It drains an area of more\r\nthan 23,000 square kilometres. Its average fall is about two metres\r\nper kilometre, but in its lower reaches its gradient is less than\r\nhalf this amount.\r\n\r\nThe principal tributaries of Wadi Kharit, which will be separately\r\ndescribed, are the Wadis Natash, Antar, Khashab, Abu Hamamid,\r\nElemikan, and Garara (this last with Wadis Timsah and Ghadrib as\r\ngreat feeders). I now propose to trace out the course of the main\r\nwadi in some detail, leaving its greater tributaries for separate\r\ndescription, but including its minor feeders.\r\n\r\nThe main head of Wadi Kharit is on the Nile-Red Sea divide, between\r\nGebel Ras el Kharit and Gebel Mikbi, at an altitude of considerably\r\nmore than 600 metres above the sea. The wadi at first courses a\r\nlittle south of west, over a gently falling sandy plain with hills\r\nof bouldery granite, and curves round the south spurs of Gebel el\r\nAnbat.[85] Here it receives two tributaries, one from the north-west\r\ncalled Wadi Hilgit, and one from the south-east called Wadi Egat.[86]\r\n\r\n=Wadi Hilgit= originates on the main watershed in longitude 34°\r\n52′, near Gebel Um Usher. A very steep and difficult pass over\r\nthe watershed separates its head from that of another Wadi Hilgit\r\ndraining northward to Wadi Huluz. The two wadis are called Wadi\r\nHilgit lil Kharit and Wadi Hilgit lil Huluz respectively when it is\r\nnecessary to distinguish them. On its course southward to Kharit,\r\nWadi Hilgit receives as tributaries =Wadi Um Hasidok= and =Wadi Um\r\nel Tiur=, draining the mountains of the same names.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Egat= drains part of the west slopes of Gebel Abu Gurdi and\r\nthe south part of Gebel Egat, for the first half of its course being\r\nshut in by high hills and for the latter half passing over a gently\r\nfalling plain.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Gebel el Anbat, Wadi Kharit continues its course a\r\nlittle south of west, in broad shallow drainage channels over a great\r\nsandy plain. In this part of its course it receives many important\r\nfeeders from the mountain masses which limit the plain to the\r\nnorth. The principal of these feeders are the =Wadis Anbat=, =Abarun=,\r\n=Um Daba=, =Abu Argub=, =Safihat=, =Um Sellim=, and =Medsus=. Near\r\nwhere Wadi Medsus enters, Wadi Kharit takes a more southerly course,\r\npassing north of a mass of low dark hills called Gebel Geneina,\r\nand here it receives =Wadi Abu Gurdi=, draining the west slopes of\r\nthe mountain of the same name, the ill-defined Wadi Elemikan (_see_\r\np. 84), draining the extensive plain south of Gebel Abu Gurdi, and\r\nthe =Rod el Geneina=, draining from the hills of Geneina. A little\r\nfurther on, curving to the north-west, it receives =Wadi Abu Hashim=\r\nand =Wadi Abu Selili=, which drain the south flanks of Gebel Kahfa.\r\n\r\nThe next feeder is the =Wadi Helie=, which drains the west slopes\r\nof Gebel Kahfa and enters Kharit from the north-east; a well, =Bir\r\nHelie=, exists in this wadi about eight kilometres above its junction\r\nwith Kharit. The well appears to be of the same character as Bir Abu\r\nHamamid; it was yielding plenty of good water in the spring of 1906,\r\nbut in the autumn of the same year the supply was said to be smaller\r\nand rather salty.\r\n\r\nAbout ten kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi Helie, Wadi\r\nKharit receives Wadi Abu Hamamid (_see_ p. 85), coming from the\r\nnorth-east, and some fourteen kilometres further on another tributary,\r\nthe =Rod el Kharuf=, enters from the opposite side conveying the\r\ndrainage from the north-west flanks of Gebel Zergat Naam.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining portion of its course to the Nile, Wadi Kharit\r\nreceives numerous other tributaries, of which the principal are Wadi\r\nKhashab and Wadi Antar on the north, and the Wadi Garara on the south\r\n(_see_ pp. 86 and 87).\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Wadi Kharit is poor in vegetation; trees are fairly\r\nabundant in the central portion of its course, but both near its\r\nhead and near the river it is very barren. In consequence of its\r\nsandy and arid character near the Nile, it is not usual for caravans\r\nto journey along the wadi from its mouth; Arabs from Daraw usually\r\ngo up the tortuous and sandy Wadi Allawi, and thence enter Kharit\r\neither by the Rod Abu Modellim or by a track among hills which leads\r\neastward to =Bir Qoleib=. Bir Qoleib is a good well in a small\r\ntributary of Wadi Kharit, about seventy kilometres by road from\r\nthe Daraw. From Bir Qoleib to the wells of Abu Hamamid and Helie\r\nthe westward journey is about 110 kilometres, while from Bir Qoleib\r\nto the well of Abu Hashim, south-east (on the road to Abu Saafa),\r\nis a distance of about seventy-five kilometres.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Elemikan= is the name given to an ill-defined system of\r\ndrainage channels meandering over the plain south of Gebel Abu\r\nGurdi. It originates on the main watershed, and at its head there\r\nis a very easy pass over into the Wadi Lahami, which descends to the\r\nsea. At this point, which is 590 metres above the sea, the watershed\r\nis ill-defined, being a sandy plain; but while to the west the plain\r\ncontinues with only a slight fall, to the east it soon gives place\r\nto rugged country through which narrow wadis descend rapidly towards\r\nthe sea coast. The plain west of the watershed is remarkable for\r\nthe presence of three great bosses of quartz, the largest of which,\r\ncalled Marwot Elemikan, rises as a conspicuous cone of dazzling\r\nwhiteness to a height of sixty-eight metres above the plain. Besides\r\nthe drainage from the plain itself, Wadi Elemikan receives feeders\r\nfrom the hills which flank Gebel Abu Gurdi to the south, and also a\r\nportion of the drainage from the Wadi Abu Gurdi, which divides into\r\ntwo channels on emerging from the mountains. Passing between the\r\ngranite hills of Gebel Abu Derega and Gebel Selaia, Wadi Elemikan\r\ncourses a little north of westward over a great sandy plain to join\r\nthe Wadi Kharit north of Gebel Geneina in longitude 34° 36′. It\r\nis a barren wadi, but water can sometimes be obtained a little north\r\nof it at a small spring called =Megal el Selaia=, at the foot of a\r\nlow hill one kilometre south-east of the great rounded granite boss\r\nof Gebel Selaia. I obtained a small supply of very good water here\r\nearly in 1906, but the spring is a very slow one and is said to fail\r\naltogether in dry seasons.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Hamamid=, an important tributary of Wadi Kharit, originates\r\nas a series of gullies in the mountains of Gebel Abu Hamamid, on the\r\nwest face of the main watershed, in longitude 34° 48′. It courses,\r\namong high hills a little north of west to longitude 34° 41′,\r\nthen turns south-west and enters the plain which extends to the west\r\nof Bir Shadli. Here it receives part of the drainage from Wadi el\r\nSheikh, and turns westward among lower hills, passing north of the\r\nred hills called El Hamra, to Bir Abu Hamamid, and then turning\r\nsouth-west between El Hamra and Hamrat Mukbud to join Kharit in\r\nlongitude 34° 23′.\r\n\r\n=Bir Abu Hamamid= is an important well; it is a rude irregular\r\nexcavation, about six metres deep, in the wadi floor, down which\r\nmen can walk to fill their water skins. This well was yielding\r\nmore plentiful supplies in the autumn of 1906 than any of the other\r\nwells in the neighbourhood; the water was rather salty and muddy,\r\nbut quite drinkable.\r\n\r\nFrom near Bir Abu Hamamid, a track leads north-westward over the\r\nhills to Bir Khashab and on to Bir Masur. To reach Bir Shadli,\r\none follows up the Wadi Abu Hamamid till it opens on to a plain,\r\nand then strikes almost due eastward across the plain.\r\n\r\nA small tributary which joins Wadi Abu Hamamid from the north-east,\r\nin longitude 34° 41′, called =Wadi Marasani=, is important\r\nas leading to a pass over the main watershed into Wadi Marasan,\r\na tributary of Wadi Huluz. The altitude of the pass is 685 metres\r\nabove sea; it is quite practicable for baggage camels.\r\n\r\n=Wadi el Sheikh=, the only great tributary of Wadi Abu Hamamid,\r\noriginates in longitude 34° 40′, in the hilly tract west of Gebel\r\nAbu Hamamid. In the upper part of its course, it is a narrow winding\r\nwadi, mostly shut in by high hills, pursuing mainly a direction\r\na little west of south, fed by numerous lateral wadis entering\r\nfrom among the hills to the east, of which the principal are the\r\n=Wadis Um Somra=, =Krioni=, =Um Nasir=, =Um Hereini=, =Um Sereiha=,\r\n=Um Deheisi=, =Um Retba=, and =Um Hargal=. Near the point where\r\nWadi Um Deheisi joins it, the Wadi el Sheikh emerges from the hill\r\ncountry and meanders over a plain. At its entry on to the plain is\r\nthe tomb and well of =Sheikh Shadli=, views of which are given on\r\nPlate V. The tomb, from which the wadi derives its name, is a white\r\ndomed structure, tended by a Moorish guardian. The Ababda Arabs\r\nhold the memory of Sheikh Shadli in high veneration, and make yearly\r\npilgrimages to his tomb. The well, =Bir Shadli=, close to the tomb,\r\nis a shallow excavation in the stony alluvium of the wadi floor. Here\r\nthere is a perennial supply of water, which, however, varies much in\r\nquality and quantity; after rain, there forms a large pool of good\r\nwater, the surface being maintained almost level with the ground by\r\nunderground influx; while when there has been no rain for a year or\r\nmore the water is only found by digging to several metres depth,\r\nand then only infiltrates slowly at the bottom of the hole, the\r\nquality simultaneously falls off and the water acquires a saline\r\nand purgative character.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Bir Shadli and entering on the plain, Wadi el Sheikh\r\nsplits up into numerous channels, one of which joins the Wadi Abu\r\nHamamid, while the others continue in a south-westerly direction,\r\nfed by the Wadis Um Retba and Um Hargal, draining from the north\r\nflanks of Gebel Kahfa. Uniting together as they leave the plain to\r\nre-form a single Wadi el Sheikh, these drainages turn westward among\r\nthe hills to join the Wadi Abu Hamamid.\r\n\r\nBir Shadli is one of the best-known centres of the Ababda\r\nArabs. Though there is no permanent settlement, it is seldom that many\r\ndays elapse without Arabs coming to the place to water their animals,\r\nwhich graze in the adjoining wadis. Many roads converge here. To the\r\nwest, a track leads to Bir Abu Hamamid. To the north-east, a track\r\nleads up the Wadi Sheikh, across Wadi Abu Hamamid, and by an easy\r\npass near Gebel Marasan over the main watershed into Wadi Huluz. To\r\nthe south-east there are several alternative routes by which one\r\ncan journey over easy passes north of Gebel Kahfa on to the plain\r\nof Selaia and down the Wadi Lahami to Berenice. Yet another road\r\nleads a little west of south across the Wadi Um Hargal, and by an\r\neasy pass into Wadi Helie, a small tributary of Wadi Kharit which\r\ndrains the west side of Gebel Kahfa, and in which there is a well\r\nof similar character to that of Abu Hamamid.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Khashab= commences its course near Gebel el Heda, a little east\r\nof longitude 34° 30′, and continues in a generally south-west\r\ndirection to the latitude of Gebel Hamrat Mukbud. Here it takes a\r\nwesterly course, passing south of Gebel Homr Akarim and entering\r\nWadi Kharit from the north in about longitude 33° 49′. Wadi\r\nKhashab receives its name from its relatively well-wooded character;\r\nin its upper parts it presents the appearance of a broad valley,\r\nin which trees are so numerous as to give a very pleasing contrast\r\nto the dreary wastes on either side of it. =Bir Khashab= is a series\r\nof pits sunk in the wadi floor in about longitude 34° 23′, which\r\nwere yielding small supplies of water in 1906.\r\n\r\nThe principal feeders of Wadi Khashab are Wadi Metawit and Wadi\r\nAntar. =Wadi Metawit= is a short valley originating near Gebel\r\nMetawit, and joining Wadi Khashab a short distance above Bir\r\nKhashab. It possesses an important well, =Bir Metawit=, excavated\r\nabout eight metres deep in the centre of the wadi floor, about three\r\nkilometres north-north-west of the summit of Gebel Metawit, on a\r\nroad leading south-east from Bir Masur to Bir Shadli. This well,\r\nnear which are some large acacia trees, was yielding a plentiful\r\nsupply of excellent water in the spring of 1906.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Antar= originates near the hills of Nukheira and El Heda,\r\nand courses westward as a very wide shallow sandy depression south\r\nof Gebel Um Goraf. At the foot of Gebel Derera it turns southward,\r\nreceiving the tributary Wadi el Anz from the left a little further\r\non; it turns again westward and then north-west to near Gebel Muktil,\r\nbeyond which it courses south-west and joins Wadi Khashab in longitude\r\n33° 55′, a short distance only above the point where that wadi\r\nenters Kharit.\r\n\r\n=Wadi el Garara=, the great southern tributary of Wadi Kharit, heads\r\non the main watershed east of Gebel Um Harba. Pursuing at first\r\na north-westerly course over a sandy plain, it emerges between two\r\nhigh sandstone hills ten kilometres north of Gebel Um Harba, and turns\r\nsomewhat more to the west, receiving the =Wadi el Kreim=, which drains\r\nthe south-east flanks of Gebel Zergat Naam. A little further on it\r\nreceives an unnamed tributary which courses north-westward from Gebel\r\nUm Harba as a great valley nearly full of blown sand. Still further\r\non its course it is fed by another unnamed tributary which, coming\r\nfrom the main watershed in latitude 23° 30′, courses over a wide\r\nsandy plain north-westwards. This latter tributary is very barren,\r\nbut is of some importance as forming a very easy though sandy road\r\nover the main watershed to the Wadi Arned (which leads to the springs\r\nof Abu Saafa) and as passing, about five kilometres before reaching\r\nthe pass, a well known water-hole called =Galt el Aguz=. This galt\r\nis a huge sandstone basin in the hills on the east side of the road,\r\nfairly easy of access. After rain it holds an immense supply of water,\r\nbut owing to the porous nature of the sandstone it becomes dry in a\r\nfew months of drought; rude Greek inscriptions on the rocks, mixed\r\nwith spirited drawings of animals, show that this source of water\r\nsupply was known and used in Ptolemaic days. Besides the drainage\r\nfrom the pass, the tributary first mentioned takes that from the\r\nsandstone hills of Um Khafur situated further east.\r\n\r\nA little lower down, Wadi Garara receives feeders from the north-east,\r\ndraining the hills round Gebel Nikeiba and Gebel Felieiti, and then\r\nthe long Wadi Timsah coming from the south.\r\n\r\nWadi Timsah heads among high granite hills a little north of latitude\r\n23°, and courses in a nearly northerly direction for nearly ninety\r\nkilometres to join Wadi Garara. The prevailing character of Wadi\r\nTimsah itself is sandy and dreary, but its feeders from the eastern\r\nhills are richer in vegetation, and in years when there is rain\r\nthey furnish in their upper portions good grazing ground for Arab\r\ncamels. The principal of these feeders, enumerating from the south\r\nnorthwards, are the =Wadis Um el Rid=, =Awamtib= (with Wadi =Um\r\nMarakh=), =Shabakhit=, and =Dagalai=. All these drain the western\r\nparts of the high sandstone hills called by the same names. Water can\r\nbe got from galts here after rain. Near the head of Wadi Um el Rid,\r\nthere is a very easy pass over the main watershed into Wadi el Dreb,\r\nwhich leads to the well of Um Reit.\r\n\r\nOf the =Wadi Ghadrib=, which heads near the hills of Gebel Abu Rahia\r\nand Gebel Um Rewat, in latitude 23°, and follows a course roughly\r\nparallel to, but a few kilometres west of that of Wadi Timsah,\r\nnot very much is known. Its prevailing character is sandy and arid.\r\n\r\nThe small tributary called =Wadi Abu Hashim=, which enters Wadi\r\nGarara from the south in about longitude 34° 5′, is important as\r\ncontaining the important wells known as =Bir Abu Hashim=. The wells\r\nare excavations in the alluvium of the wadi floor, and furnish good\r\nwater at a depth of about eight metres. A beacon has been erected\r\non a high hill to the west of the wells and overlooking them, the\r\nposition of which is latitude 23° 41′ 44″ N., longitude 34° 3′\r\n33″ E., altitude 386 metres above sea and sixty-six metres above\r\nthe wells. The principal roads from Bir Abu Hashim are, to Aswân\r\n(first water at Um Hibal, nearly one hundred kilometres distant), to\r\nDaraw (first water at Bir Qoleib, seventy-five kilometres distant),\r\nand to Abu Saafa Springs (a journey of about one hundred kilometres\r\nwith possibly water en route at the Galt el Aguz, sixty kilometres\r\nfrom Abu Hashim).\r\n\r\n=Wadi Natash= commences among the low hills forming the Nile —\r\nRed Sea watershed between Gebel Migif and Gebel Abu Had. It pursues\r\na course roughly parallel with that of Wadi Shait, at first over a\r\nsandy plain from which rise the two conspicuous cones called El Nahud\r\n(the breasts), and afterwards narrowing in among hills. Pursuing a\r\nsomewhat devious course in a direction generally a little south of\r\nwest, Wadi Natash passes south of Gebel Nugra (in longitude 33°\r\n40′) and enters on the great plain called Atmur Nugra, where it\r\njoins the Wadi Kharit and drains to the Nile near Kom Ombo.\r\n\r\nThere is, I believe, no water source in Wadi Natash itself, but =Bir\r\nMasur= is situated in a branch wadi only a few kilometres north of\r\nit in longitude 34°. At Bir Masur there are numerous pits sunk in\r\nthe alluvium of the wadi, in one or more of which good water can\r\ngenerally be found at a depth of about ten metres; but the supply\r\ncannot always be relied on, for although I obtained plenty of water\r\nin March 1906, I found there was only a very small quantity available\r\nin October of the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wadi Alaqi=, the greatest of all the Egyptian wadis draining\r\nwestwards to the Nile, has its head on the main watershed near\r\nGebel Is, close to the 22nd parallel in longitude 35° 27′. Its\r\nmain channel, over 350 kilometres in length, pursues a general\r\nwesterly course, winding at first, past the old mining centres of\r\nDarahib and Alfawi, towards Gebel Muqsim, on the 34th meridian,\r\nand then, curving round to the north of that mountain, it turns to\r\nthe north-west, past the gold mines of Um Gariart, and enters the\r\nNile Valley opposite the large village of Dakka, in latitude 23°\r\n8′. The area of its basin is unknown, much of it being unexplored,\r\nbut it probably comprises no less than four square degrees of the\r\nearth’s surface, or 44,000 square kilometres. Its heads and upper\r\ntributaries lie among high mountainous tracts partly in Egypt and\r\npartly in the Sudan, and occasionally the rainfall in these southern\r\nparts of the eastern desert is sufficient to convert the usually dry\r\nwadi into a temporary stream for a part or all of its length. That\r\nit may on the rare occasions of sufficient rainfall discharge no\r\ninconsiderable quantity of water into the Nile is proved by Linant’s\r\nexperience about 1830, when he records that the torrent from the\r\nWadi Alaqi into the Nile was so great as to prevent his _dahabîa_\r\nsailing up the river past the point of influx, even with a good wind\r\nand all sails set.[87] A great flow of water down the Wadi Alaqi\r\nalso occurred in the autumn of 1902 as a consequence of heavy rains\r\nin the mountainous country east of the meridian 34° 30′. This\r\ntorrent was observed by Mr. John F. Wells, who was then manager of\r\nthe Um Gariart mine. In the early morning news was brought to the\r\nmine that great waters were coming down the wadi. Except for a slight\r\nrainfall at the heads of the Wadis Qoleib and Haimur, the drainage\r\nof which did not appreciably swell the flood of the main wadi,\r\nthere had been no rain within one hundred kilometres of the mine,\r\nand when the alarm was given, at 6.30 a.m., only a small trickling\r\nof water down the wadi was visible, and the news was thought to\r\nbe an exaggeration. But an hour later the whole wadi was a raging\r\ntorrent, and by nine o’clock there was a mighty stream, over 300\r\nmetres wide and from one to two and a half metres deep, rushing past\r\nthe mine. The flow continued for about two and a half days. On this\r\noccasion the stream, in spite of its magnitude at Um Gariart, did\r\nnot reach the Nile; after flowing for some seventy kilometres past\r\nthe mines, it entered a wide depression at Hagab Kara, some forty\r\nkilometres from the mouth of the wadi, where it formed a great pool\r\nand sank into the sand. Mr. Wells informs me that the water did not\r\npenetrate the sandy and gravelly floor of the wadi to the bed rock\r\n(the thickness of the sandy and gravelly layer at Um Gariart is\r\nfourteen metres) till three months later, and then the rock, though\r\ndamp, did not absorb enough water to yield any supply to wells sunk\r\nin it. The local Arabs stated that these downrushes of water, which\r\nthey term “seil,” occur on an average at about ten-year intervals;\r\nthe last one occurred seven years before that of 1902.\r\n\r\nThe part of the basin of Wadi Alaqi falling within the limits of the\r\ndistrict described in this volume includes the whole country west\r\nof the main watershed between the parallels of 22° and 23°. This\r\narea is drained by numerous tributaries of Alaqi, all entering the\r\nmain wadi from its north side. The following is a brief description\r\nof these tributaries, commencing with the uppermost (easternmost)\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Himeitra= is a small wadi draining the south face of Gebel\r\nHimeitra. It contains a well, =Bir Himeitra=, at the foot of the\r\nmountain, which is said to yield constant supplies of water. Below\r\nthe well, Wadi Himeitra continues for about ten kilometres in\r\na south-westerly direction, joining the Wadi Alaqi about seven\r\nkilometres above the ruins of Darahib.\r\n\r\nThe =Miti Kwan=, the next tributary of Alaqi, has its heads in\r\nthe north flanks of Gebel Himeitra. Near its head it receives\r\nas feeders from the north-east the =Wadis Kirir= and =Duag=,\r\ndraining mountains of the same name which form part of the Adar\r\nQaqa range. About fourteen kilometres further down its course, the\r\nMiti Kwan receives the =Wadi Merau=, which drains the hills of the\r\nmain watershed round Eir Arib. Below the point of influx of Merau,\r\nthe Miti Kwan pursues a very winding course among the hills for some\r\neleven kilometres, then receives from the north the =Wadi Miaus=,\r\na small wadi with many branches among the hills and containing a\r\nwell, =Bir Miaus=, about seven kilometres up from its mouth. After\r\nreceiving Wadi Miaus, the Miti Kwan continues a winding course for\r\nabout nine kilometres and enters the Wadi Alaqi on the 22nd parallel,\r\nabout fifteen kilometres below the ruins of Darahib. A well-known\r\nroad, connecting the Wadi Alaqi with the Abu Hodeid and Meisah wells,\r\nleads up the Miti Kwan for a distance of some twenty-three kilometres,\r\nand then passes northwards over a stony plain, crossing the watershed\r\ninto the head of Wadi Hasium, in which is Bir Kagog.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Dageina= is a small many-branched tributary of Alaqi, draining\r\nthe hills east of Gebel Egat.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Alfawi=, which enters Wadi Alaqi a little lower down its course,\r\nis likewise a small wadi draining the hilly tract east of Gebel Egat;\r\nthere are some old mines on its western side close to its junction\r\nwith Wadi Alaqi.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Egat=, the next important tributary of Alaqi, drains by\r\nvery numerous branches the remarkable peak of Gebel Egat and the\r\nsouth faces of Gebel Heleikonti. It contains a well, =Bir Egat=,\r\nsituated east-south-east of the peak, about twenty-six kilometres\r\nup from its junction with Alaqi, and there are extensive remains of\r\nold mining operations to be seen in the same neighbourhood. Passing\r\neast and south of Gebel Egat, the wadi emerges from the mountains,\r\ncoursing almost due west; and after receiving various feeders, the\r\nprincipal of which is =Wadi Hiteib=, from the mountains to the north,\r\nit enters Wadi Alaqi in longitude 34° 40′, about twenty kilometres\r\nwest of Gebel Egat.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Hateib=,[88] which enters Wadi Alaqi about twenty kilometres\r\nbelow Wadi Egat, has its heads in the south faces of Gebel Um el Tiur\r\nel Foqani and the north flanks of Gebel el Hateib or Suhin. Coursing\r\ngenerally south-westward, it receives small feeders on the west from\r\nGebels Adraq and Guqub. About four kilometres above where it enters\r\nWadi Alaqi, Wadi Hateib is joined from the east by =Wadi Suhin=,\r\nthe heads of which drain the south faces of Gebel Hateib or Suhin.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Guqub=, a very small wadi which enters Alaqi six kilometres\r\nlower down than Hateib, drains the hilly tract which here lies to\r\nthe north of Alaqi; it contains an important well, =Bir Guqub=,\r\nwhich yields good water though in varying quantity. A road leads\r\nfrom Wadi Alaqi up the Wadi Guqub past the well and on to Aswân,\r\n_via_ El Haimur.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um Teneideb= drains the western faces of Gebels el Adraq\r\nand Guqub, and joins Wadi Alaqi in longitude 34° 11′, about\r\nthirty-three kilometres below Wadi Gugub. It has two main branches,\r\nwhich unite about ten kilometres above the point of junction with\r\nWadi Alaqi. The old mines of Betam are situated near the northern\r\nof the two branches, about seven kilometres west of Gebel el Adraq,\r\non the road just mentioned as leading from Wadi Alaqi to Aswân.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Defeit=, which is probably the most important Egyptian tributary\r\nof Wadi Alaqi, has its heads in Gebels Heleikontî and Heianai, about\r\nthe meridian of 35°. Its general course is that of a flat circular\r\narc convex to the north and having its chord east and west; the total\r\nlength of its main channel, from its head in Gebel Heleikontî to\r\nits junction with Wadi Alaqi in longitude 34° 10′, is over one\r\nhundred kilometres, while its numerous tributaries probably reach a\r\ntotal length three times as great. The principal head of Wadi Defeit\r\nis called =Wadi Sarid=; its branches extend among the hills close to\r\nthe heads of Wadi Egat and Wadi Miaus. The name Defeit is applied\r\nto the wadi where Wadi Sarid is joined by the feeders from Gebel\r\nHeleikontî. Passing between the high ranges of Heianai on the north,\r\nand Heleikontî and Shanaiyet on the south, Wadi Defeit receives\r\nnumerous feeders, of which the principal are the =Wadis Dauriai=\r\nand =Hamidâ=, both entering it from the mountain to the south;\r\ncontinuing westwards, it cuts through the north end of the mass of\r\nGebel Um el Tiur el Foqani, and on emergence is joined by the =Wadi\r\nBint el Feqoh=, a great westward-coursing tributary draining the\r\nnorth flanks of the Heianai range and the more northerly mountain\r\nof Anweyib. Continuing its westward course, Wadi Defeit passes\r\nbetween Gebels Um el Tiur el Tahtani and Adraq; then it enters on an\r\nextensive tract of more open country, receiving three main feeders,\r\n=Wadi Meladoyeb=, =Rod Hauanin=, and =Wadi Bagharid=, from the hills\r\nto the north, before joining Wadi Alaqi.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Seiga=, the next great northern tributary of Wadi Alaqi, has\r\nonly been partially explored. Its head is in the watershed range near\r\nthe conspicuous twin peaks of Gebel Sheyenit. Pursuing at first a\r\nsoutherly course, it cuts through the east side of the mass of Gebel\r\nSeiga; and about thirty kilometres lower down passes through hills\r\nwith old gold mines on either hand. Below the mines, Wadi Seiga takes\r\na south-westerly course, and receives a large tributary from either\r\nside. That from the west, called =Wadi Deheis=, heads in Gebel Deheis\r\nand curves round east of Gebel Abu Brush, receiving in its course\r\ntwo great feeders, the =Wadis Um Gholqa= and =Abu Had=, both of which\r\nhead far to the north in the main watershed. The eastern tributary,\r\ncalled =Wadi Um Derera=, drains the south part of the hill-mass in\r\nwhich the Seiga mines are situated. Wadi Seiga joins Wadi Alaqi in\r\nlongitude 33° 53′, some forty-five kilometres below the mines;\r\nthe junction is outside the limits of the maps in this volume.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Dry in 1906.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: To be distinguished from another mountain of the same\r\nname further south, near the Wadi Hodein.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: To be distinguished from the better known Wadi Egat\r\nmuch further south, a feeder of Wadi Alaqi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: “L’Etbaye.” p. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Mr. Campbell’s map names this Wadi Hadaiber. My\r\nguides, however, gave the name Gebel Hateib to the mountain which\r\nis drained by the wadi, and I have ventured to alter the name on\r\nthis ground. Mr. Campbell’s map names the mountain Gebel Suhin;\r\nit probably has two names, as is quite usual in desert nomenclature,\r\nbecause its two sides are drained by different wadis. There is a Wadi\r\nHiteib draining from the south-eastern part of the same hill-mass\r\ninto Wadi Egat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n              =THE WADIS DRAINING EASTWARDS TO THE SEA.=\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastward drainage differs strikingly from the westward in being\r\nmuch steeper and more complex, due to the greater proximity of\r\nthe mountains to the sea than to the Nile. While all the westward\r\ndrainages form parts of but three great basins, there are on the\r\nseaward side no less than forty-seven distinct drainage basins,\r\neach having a separate outlet to sea (_see_ Plate II). Only two of\r\nthe eastern basins, Hodein and Di-it, are comparable in size with\r\nthe great basins of the west, the remainder being relatively small.\r\n\r\nThe following list gives the names in order, from north to south, of\r\nthe main wadis draining to the sea, with their tributaries so far as\r\nthey fall within the area treated of in this volume, the principal\r\nfeeders of the tributaries being indicated in parentheses. It may\r\nbe remarked that the minor feeders and tributaries are frequently\r\nof greater importance to the Arabs than the main channels, owing to\r\ntheir containing vegetation in greater abundance.\r\n\r\n  WADI DABUR.\r\n\r\n  WADI IGLI.\r\n\r\n  WADI UM KHARIGA.\r\n\r\n  WADI SUKARI.\r\n\r\n  WADI UM TUNDEBA.\r\n\r\n  WADI AMBA-UT.\r\n\r\n                     { Wadi Ghuel.\r\n

QABATIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wadi Dabur= falls only partly within the district to be described\r\nin the present volume. It drains the hill country between Gebels\r\nAtut and Igli, by numerous feeders, and courses north-east to enter\r\nthe sea about latitude 25° 16′, beyond the limits shown on the map.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Igli= is a short wadi draining from Gebel Igli and coursing a\r\nlittle north of east to the sea somewhat south of latitude 25° 10′.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um Khariga= has its principal head in a _cul-de-sac_ west\r\nof Gebel Ghuel and north of Gebel Hangalia, at an altitude of\r\napproximately 800 metres above sea-level. Near its head there is an\r\neasy pass entering from the west, forming a line of communication\r\nwith Hangalia mine; the highest point of the pass is 773 metres above\r\nsea-level. After coursing for about twelve kilometres a little west\r\nof north between the high hills called Gebel Um Khariga, with a rapid\r\nfall, the wadi turns north-east, receiving just below the bend a large\r\ntributary which heads in an easy pass to Wadi Ghadir. Near this place\r\na road crosses the wadi northwards through the low hills, and passes\r\nwest of Gebel Igli el Iswid; it is said to go on to Qena. Further\r\non in its course towards the sea, Wadi Um Khariga receives another\r\ntributary draining the south flanks of Gebel Igli el Iswid. The\r\nlower portion of Wadi Um Khariga has not been surveyed in detail;\r\nbut it passes through a tract of lower hills and enters the sea in\r\nabout latitude 25° 5′. The total length of the main channel of\r\nWadi Um Khariga is about fifty kilometres, and the area of its basin\r\nis about 300 square kilometres.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Sukari=, the next wadi to the south, heads at a pass from Wadi\r\nGhadir; for about nine kilometres it courses east of north between\r\nthe eastern range of Gebel Um Khariga and the craggy Gebel Sukari,\r\nthen turns more to the east and enters the sea a little south of Wadi\r\nUm Khariga. Near the south end of Gebel Sukari there are numerous\r\nruins and some ancient gold mines.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um Tundeba= heads near the mountain of the same name, and\r\ncourses about north-east to the sea. In one of the heads of this wadi,\r\nabout three kilometres west of the summit of Gebel Um Tundeba, is\r\nan important water source, called =Galt Um Tundeba=. This is a rock\r\nbasin situated about one kilometre up a little wadi; it contained\r\na good supply of water in December 1905, but as it depends for its\r\nsupply on rainfall in the surrounding hills, it cannot be relied on\r\nas a permanent water source.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Amba-ut= is a small wadi originating near the granite hills\r\ncalled Gebel Amba-ut, and following a course about parallel with\r\nthe Wadi Um Tundeba seawards.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Ghadir=, which drains by numerous tributaries the eastern\r\nface of Gebels Hangalia and Zabara, as well as the hilly country\r\nround Gebels Ghadir, Allawi, and Lewewi, has a basin of over 500\r\nsquare kilometres and a length along its main channel, not counting\r\nits feeders, of about forty-five kilometres; it enters the sea in\r\nlatitude 24° 50′.\r\n\r\nThe principal head of Wadi Ghadir is at an easy pass between Gebels\r\nGhuel and Um Khariga, in latitude 24° 55′, at an altitude of about\r\n500 metres above sea-level. Coursing south-east, it receives important\r\nfeeders from gorges in the west face of Gebel Ghuel; the principal\r\nof these feeders, =Wadi Ghuel=, contains water holes, which gave an\r\nexcellent supply of rain water in 1905-06. A little further along its\r\ncourse, Wadi Ghadir passes the low hill district called =Kurdeman=,\r\nwhere there are some old gold mines, and then receives as tributaries\r\n=Wadi Fegas= and =Wadi Ma-ud=, draining the mountains of Ghuel and\r\nHangalia. Taking now a more easterly direction towards Gebel Ghadir,\r\nit receives from the north-west =Wadi Sabahia=, draining the craggy\r\nfelsite hill of the same name; there are some old gold mines about\r\na kilometre north-east of this hill, in a branch of Wadi Sabahia.\r\n\r\nThe =Wadi Zabara=, an important tributary draining the north flanks\r\nof Gebel Zabara and the south-east part of Gebel Hangalia, enters\r\nGhadir from the south-west, nearly opposite Wadi Sabahia. Wadi\r\nZabara has itself three main heads, called by the separate names of\r\n=Wadi Atabi=, =Wadi Um Abid=, and =Wadi Um Dafiri=. There are ruins\r\nand ancient mines close to where the Wadi Atabi joins Wadi Zabara,\r\nwhile in the upper part of Wadi Um Dafiri are more extensive ruins\r\nand numerous ancient emerald mines, as well as a series of rock\r\nbasins which were yielding good water in 1905-1906.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the Wadi Zabara, Wadi Ghadir continues its course\r\nsouth-east past Gebel Ghadir, from the slopes of which numerous small\r\nfeeders enter the main channel. Almost due south of Gebel Ghadir,\r\nin the southern one of two branches into which the wadi splits as\r\nit passes round a low island-like mass of hills, is =Bir Ghadir=,\r\na well sunk in the alluvium of the wadi floor. When I visited it\r\nearly in 1906 this well was filled by downwash, and the Arabs of the\r\ndistrict deferred digging it out until the rock basins were empty; it\r\nis an important water source and is said to yield good supplies. The\r\nmines of Hangalia were supplied by water from Bir Ghadir in 1905,\r\nwhen nearer sources were dry.\r\n\r\nAbout six kilometres below the well, Wadi Ghadir passes close north\r\nof Gebel Allawi, where there are some old gold mines. The =Wadi\r\nAllawi=, which with its tributary =Wadi Lewewi= drains the hilly\r\ncountry between Gebels Zabara and Sikait, enters Ghadir a little to\r\nthe east of Gebel Allawi; both Allawi and Lewewi are very tortuous\r\nwadis, their names in fact meaning “crooked” in the Ababda tongue\r\n(Lewewi is a diminutive of Allawi).\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um Gamil=, the next wadi entering the sea to the south, drains\r\nthe hilly country south-east of Sikait. Very little is known about its\r\ncourse, the only part surveyed being the heads east of Gebel Sikait.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Gemal= is the terminal portion, about sixty kilometres in\r\nlength, of the main drainage channel from a basin nearly 200 square\r\nkilometres in area. With its numerous large feeders, the principal\r\nof which is Wadi Huluz, about eighty kilometres in length, the Wadi\r\nGemal drains the Hafafit and Nugrus ranges of mountains on the north,\r\nand a great mass of high mountains, including Gebel Hamata, on the\r\nsouth. It will be convenient here to describe only the Wadi Gemal\r\nproper, leaving the great wadis which join to form it, and its major\r\ntributaries, for separate treatment.\r\n\r\nThe name Wadi Gemal is first given to the drainage at the point\r\nwhere Wadi Huluz turns sharply eastward in longitude 34° 39′.[89]\r\nAt this point the country becomes more open than in the gorge-like\r\nWadi Huluz. To the north is a mass of low granite hills, some of\r\nwhich have remarkable shapes, with a great deal of drift sand,\r\nwhile to the south are the higher dark hills flanking Gebel Um\r\nSuerab. Among these surroundings the wadi pursues a winding course,\r\nwith a general north-easterly direction, receiving the Wadi Um Suerab\r\nlil Gemal and the Wadi Durunkat as tributaries from the south.\r\n\r\nAbout six kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi Durunkat, on\r\nthe right (south) side of Wadi Gemal, is a locality called =Geli=,\r\nwhere there are extensive ruins. A very remarkable rock in the middle\r\nof the main wadi marks the place whence a track leads south-east\r\npast the ruins and across the heads of Wadis Um Ghazal and Mukhatatat\r\ninto the upper part of Wadi el Abiad.\r\n\r\nPassing a remarkable bell-shaped hill (Gebel Um Regeba, rising to\r\n571 metres above sea, the “mosque rock” of Floyer’s map) about\r\nfour kilometres on the left, Wadi Gemal receives two small feeders\r\ncoming from among the hills to the south, and then the important\r\ntributary called Wadi Hafafit enters from the north-west.\r\n\r\nBelow the point of influx of Hafafit, the Wadi Gemal becomes more\r\nnarrow, and shut in by high hills. Near the meridian of 34° 49′\r\nthere are some ruins on the north side of the wadi, and a little\r\nfurther on the Wadi Nugrus, one of the largest tributaries of Wadi\r\nGemal, enters from the north-west at a rather sharp bend. Further\r\ndown, Wadi Gemal receives =Wadi el Mukhatatat= and =Wadi Um Sueh=\r\nfrom the south, and =Wadi Um Heran= and =Wadi el Nasbia= from the\r\nnorth. The Wadi Abiad, which next joins Wadi Gemal from the south,\r\nis an important feeder. Two kilometres below the mouth of Wadi el\r\nAbiad, the =Wadi Um Kabu= enters Wadi Gemal from the north-west,\r\nwhile nearly opposite to it is a small wadi, called =Um Sellimi=,\r\nin which there are water pools after rain. The wadi now curves more\r\nnorthward round the base of the double-topped hill mass called Madaret\r\nUm Gamil. Just beyond the northward turn a road[90] leads up a narrow\r\ntortuous gully in a north-westerly direction, passing close south\r\nof the hill summit and forming the most ready means of ascent of\r\nMadaret Um Gamil; the climb from the road at the top of the gully is\r\nonly about 200 metres. The course of the Wadi Gemal to the sea has not\r\nbeen surveyed beyond four kilometres east of Madaret Um Gamil; it goes\r\nthrough low hilly country and enters the sea in about latitude 24°.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Wadi Gemal averages about six metres per kilometre,\r\nbeing as low as four metres per kilometre in some places, and probably\r\nexceeding ten metres per kilometre where it emerges from the hills on\r\nto the coast-plain. It is interesting to note that the observations\r\nof level indicate a local increase of gradient above the place of\r\ninflux of Hafafit and Nugrus. The Wadi Gemal is well supplied with\r\ntrees, as are also almost all its tributaries with the exception of\r\nthe sandy Wadi Hafafit.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Huluz= is a long winding wadi, mostly shut in by high rock\r\nwalls, draining the high mountains round Gebel Hamata and coursing\r\nnorth-east for a distance of over seventy-five kilometres to the\r\npoint, near Gebel Um Suerab, where, turning sharply eastward,\r\nit enters more open country and takes the name of Wadi Gemal. The\r\nslope of Wadi Huluz averages fifty metres per kilometre for the\r\nfirst ten kilometres from its heads in the mountains. In the next\r\nten kilometres the slope is much flatter, being twenty metres per\r\nkilometre. From twenty to forty kilometres from its head the average\r\nfall is only ten metres per kilometre, while still further down the\r\nrate of fall lessens till in the last reaches, just before entering\r\nthe Wadi Gemal, it is only six and a half metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\nThe principal heads of Wadi Huluz are close to the south-east\r\nof Gebel Hamata, in a _cul-de-sac_ formed by the high mountains\r\nof Gebel Hamata (1,978 metres above sea) and Gebel Ras el Kharit\r\n(1,661 metres). Here a number of steep gorges unite to form the main\r\nchannel, which due south of Hamata has an altitude of 1,053 metres\r\nabove sea-level. Following a winding course among the mountains as\r\na rapidly falling valley with a sandy floor averaging 100 metres or\r\nmore in width, it passes west of the great mass of Hamata, receiving\r\nthe drainages from the north-east flanks of that mountain and from\r\nthe north face of Gebel Um Hasidok. At its crossing the meridian of\r\n35° it receives as a feeder the =Wadi el Abiad lil Huluz=, which\r\ndrains the north face of Hamata and the south flanks of Gebel Abu\r\nGhusun; draining mostly from granite country, this feeder has a\r\nfloor of coarse granitic sand, from the whitish colour of which it\r\ntakes its name.\r\n\r\nThe next feeder of Wadi Huluz, called =Wadi Mahali=, enters from\r\nthe south, its head being on the main watershed between Gebels Um\r\nUsher and Um Hasidok. Passing between Gebels Um Usher and Um Laham,\r\nthe Wadi Huluz receives =Wadi Tarfawi=, draining the mountain of the\r\nsame name from the east. Further down, feeders come in from Gebel\r\nel Mehali on the south and from the high hills south of Gebel Um\r\nHeshenib on the north. Near the meridian of 34° 50′ two important\r\ntributaries enter Huluz near together from the south. The upper one,\r\n=Wadi Hilgit lil Huluz=, heads in a very steep and difficult pass,\r\nleading into Wadi Hilgit lil Kharit. The lower one, called =Wadi Um\r\nSemiuki=, drains the north-east flanks of Gebel Abu Hamamid. Nearly\r\nopposite the mouth of Wadi Um Semiuki is another feeder of Wadi Huluz,\r\nwhich I believe forms the main drainage channel for the south face\r\nof Gebel Um Heshenib; but it is said to be very steep and stony,\r\nand my Arabs preferred to reach Gebel Um Heshenib by a small wadi,\r\ncontaining several tombs, some four kilometres higher up Wadi Huluz,\r\nwhence there is a stony pass leading into the above-mentioned main\r\ndrainage channel at a point above the obstructions in it.\r\n\r\nAbout eight kilometres further on, on the north-east side of the wadi,\r\nthere is a low gap over which by a very easy pass one can descend\r\ninto the head of Wadi Durunkat, leading to Wadi Gemal. Some three\r\nkilometres lower down, Huluz receives two tributaries together;\r\none, from the south-east, is called =Wadi Um Hegiligi lil Huluz=,\r\nwhile the other, from the south-west, is called =Wadi Marasan=\r\nand heads in an easy pass on the main watershed, over which a track\r\nleads south-east and south to the well and tomb of Sheikh Shadli.\r\n\r\nTwo sheikhs’ tombs and some smaller graves exist at a bend in\r\nthe Wadi Huluz, three kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi\r\nMarasan. Below these enter as feeders =Wadi Um Suerab lil Huluz=\r\nfrom the north, and =Wadi Abu Gerifat= from the south. The wadi\r\nnow becomes very tortuous. Near the meridian of 34° 40′, on the\r\nsouth side of the wadi, at a bend where trees are very abundant,\r\nis a small gully containing the important water holes called =Um\r\nGerifat=. These are rock basins fed by rain water draining down\r\nsteep gorges from the hills round the twin-peaked Gebel Um Sedri;\r\nthey are easily accessible in a few minutes from the main wadi, and\r\ncontained good supplies of water in the winter of 1905-1906. About\r\nfour kilometres lower down, the =Wadi Um Iteili= enters from the\r\neast, and about five kilometres beyond this Huluz opens out into a\r\nsomewhat triangular space, when the =Wadi Gaetri= enters from the\r\nwest and =Wadi el Khisei= from the east. The Wadi Gaetri leads by\r\nan important pass into the more open country to the west (wells of\r\nWadi Khashab and Wadi Natash).\r\n\r\nAt the open space above-mentioned, Wadi Huluz turns northward, winding\r\nsomewhat, for some eight kilometres, and then, after receiving the\r\n=Wadi Abu Etl= as a feeder from the west, turns sharply eastward\r\nand becomes the Wadi Gemal.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Durunkat=, a tributary of Wadi Gemal, forms an important road\r\nfrom Wadi Gemal into the higher parts of Huluz. By following it up to\r\nits head about twenty kilometres from its junction with Wadi Gemal,\r\none can enter Wadi Huluz by a very easy pass in longitude 34° 46′,\r\nthus cutting off the long winding course of Wadi Huluz itself; and\r\nfrom this pass one can cross the main watershed by the Wadi Marasan\r\nto reach Bir Shadli.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Hafafit=, another tributary of Wadi Gemal, has its head situated\r\nclose to the east side of Gebel Migif, in latitude 24° 50′, on\r\nthe main watershed, where there is an easy pass into the head of Wadi\r\nShait. Following a very straight course for nearly forty kilometres\r\nsouth-east, with the remarkable range of high gneiss mountains called\r\nGebel Hafafit on the left, and the sugar loaf granite hills of Abu\r\nHad on the right, Wadi Hafafit forms a broad barren valley in which\r\nthere are heavy accumulations of blown sand. =Wadi Abu Had=, a small\r\nwestern feeder of Hafafit, is well known by reason of the well of\r\nbitter water, =Bir Abu Had=, at its head. An eastern feeder of Wadi\r\nHafafit, which joins it shortly before the junction with Wadi Gemal,\r\nis called by the diminutive name of =Wadi Hefeifit=.\r\n\r\n=Wadi el Abiad=, likewise a tributary of Wadi Gemal, derives its name\r\nfrom the coarse white granitic sand which forms its floor. Its heads\r\nare situated near latitude 24° 20′, among the granite mountains\r\ncalled Gebel el Abiad and on the northerly slopes of Gebel Um\r\nHeshenib. There is a very steep pass from its head, east of Gebel\r\nUm Heshenib, into Wadi Huluz. Pursuing an almost northerly course\r\nand falling rather rapidly, Wadi el Abiad is at first very wide,\r\nwith high granite hills on each side. It narrows further down, at\r\na point opposite Gebel Shoab, where a small eastern feeder leads by\r\nan easy sandy pass into the Wadi Shoab. A little lower down, passing\r\ninto diorite country, it turns more to the east, and after receiving\r\nthe =Wadis Um Seyal el Foqani= and =el Tahtani= from the south-east,\r\nenters the Wadi Gemal near Madaret Um Gamil. The wadis called Um\r\nSeyal receive their name from the abundance of acacia trees in them;\r\nat the head of Wadi Um Seyal el Foqani there is a pass leading by\r\nthe Wadai el Anz into Wadi Um el Abbas.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Nugrus=, an important tributary of Wadi Gemal, commences\r\nits course on the main watershed west of Gebel Nugrus, in latitude\r\n24° 48′, at the pass into Wadi Gerf, 690 metres above sea-level,\r\nand courses south-east in almost a straight line for nearly forty\r\nkilometres to join the Wadi Gemal in latitude 24° 34′ and longitude\r\n34° 50′. The fall to this point is some 450 metres, or an average\r\nof over ten metres per kilometre, but the fall is most rapid near\r\nthe head, where the floor of the wadi is rocky and steep; the slope\r\nfor the first few kilometres is over double the average.\r\n\r\nThe approach to the head of Wadi Nugrus from the north, by one\r\nof the heads of Wadi Gerf, is almost a plain. But as soon as\r\nWadi Nugrus is entered one becomes very sensible of the greater\r\nsteepness of the eastern drainage by the stony nature of the track\r\nand the rapid fall. The wadi here is in fact only a narrow gorge\r\nwith the huge mountains of Hafafit and Nugrus on the west and east\r\nsides respectively. Some three kilometres below the pass, close to\r\nthe west side of the wadi, in a narrow gorge, is the spring called\r\n=Megal el Harami=, situated in gneiss rocks, and giving supplies of\r\ngood water; the water infiltrates slowly, however, so that the yield\r\nis not sufficiently rapid to supply large quantities at once. Lower\r\ndown, the wadi broadens out considerably, with a sandy floor in the\r\nmiddle of which low dark hills rise like islands. About thirteen\r\nkilometres below the head, an important feeder, the =Wadai el Nom=,\r\ncomes in from the north-east. This wadi drains the south-east flanks\r\nof Gebel Nugrus and the west flanks of Gebel Hangalia; it contains\r\nrock basins holding water for some time after rain, and leads to\r\na steep winding pass which enables one to make a circuit round\r\nthe great granite mountain of Gebel Nugrus. The pass is, however,\r\nimpracticable for baggage camels, and one has to dismount from a\r\nriding camel in order to get over.\r\n\r\nBeyond the junction of Wadai el Nom, the Wadi Nugrus continues its\r\nstraight course south-east, between the long range of Gebel Hafafit\r\non the west and Gebel Zabara on the east. Some thirty kilometres\r\nbelow its head, Wadi Nugrus receives the =Wadi Abu Rusheid= from\r\nthe north, and a little further on one encounters on the east the\r\nruins of an old village called =Medina Nugrus=. Just opposite the\r\nruins is a small feeder called =Wadi Abu Sada=, a short distance up\r\nwhich are rock basins yielding water after rain, but these were dry\r\nin 1905. Not far below this, there are some old workings in a small\r\nfeeder on the east side of the Wadi Nugrus, six kilometres above\r\nits junction with Wadi Gemal.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Sikait=, a tributary of Wadi Nugrus, heads in some high red\r\ngranite hills north-west of Gebel Sikait. A pass leads over the\r\nwestern head, while in the eastern one is a small spring, which,\r\nthough a mere trickle, is said to be constant and to yield excellent\r\nwater. These two heads join at a well recently sunk by miners. Lower\r\ndown, on the flanks of Gebel Sikait, are numerous emerald mines,\r\nwith an ancient tower and many other ruins, and in the wadi near\r\nthese is another recently sunk well, which has only yielded water\r\nof inferior quality. From near the mines there lead two tracks on\r\neither side of the wadi. That to the west is a rough path over gneiss\r\nhills into Wadi Abu Rusheid. That to the east winds past the ancient\r\ntower, ascending gradually to a pass into one of the heads of Wadi\r\nUm Gamil. Lower down the Wadi Sikait are many ancient mines, and the\r\nruins of three rock temples and an ancient village. Just before the\r\nWadi Sikait enters Wadi Nugrus, a track leaves on the east for =Wadi\r\nUm Heran=, in which I am told water is sometimes to be found. The\r\nlength of the Wadi Sikait is about fourteen kilometres, and its fall\r\nis from 535 metres above sea at the pass at its head to about 250\r\nmetres where it enters Wadi Nugrus, or an average slope of twenty\r\nmetres per kilometre. It is a narrow gorge shut in by high hills,\r\nwith a fair abundance of trees.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um el Abbas= originates by the union of several heads in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the high granite hills of Um el Abbas and Abu\r\nHegilig. One of its heads leads to an easy pass called =Kab el Haram=,\r\nfour and a half kilometres east of Gebel Abu Hegilig. Another, close\r\neast of Gebel Abu Hegilig, leads to another easy pass into the head of\r\na tributary of Wadi Romit. A third head, called the =Wadai el Anz=,\r\nleads to yet another pass into Wadi Um Seyal el Foqani, a tributary\r\nof Wadi el Abiad. The course of the Wadi Um el Abbas has only been\r\nsurveyed for a short distance below the place where its heads unite;\r\nit pursues a north-easterly course among low hilly country and enters\r\nthe sea in about latitude 24° 36′.\r\n\r\n                                                             PLATE VI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE DISTRICT OF NUGRUS & SIKAIT\r\n\r\nBall. Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Metal-Process. Survey Dept. Cairo 1910. (60-190)]\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Ghusun= commences its course among the high mountains of\r\nGebel Abu Ghusun, north of Gebel Hamata. Pursuing a northerly course\r\nfor about ten kilometres, it passes close east of the sharp granite\r\npeak of Gebel Hefeiri, then turns more to the east, receiving Wadi\r\nRomit as an important tributary from the west near the bend, and\r\nreaches the sea in about latitude 24° 29′.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Romit=, a tributary of Abu Ghusun, originates in the granite\r\nmountains called Gebel el Abiad, near the parallel of 24° 20′ and\r\nfollows a winding course in a general easterly direction for about\r\nsixteen kilometres to its junction with Wadi Abu Ghusun. It receives\r\nseveral important tributaries. The chief of these, =Wadi Shoab=,\r\noriginates close to the south-west of Gebel Shoab, where there is\r\nan easy pass into the Wadi el Abiad. Another tributary of Romit,\r\nthe =Wadi Abu Hegilig=, drains the south part of Gebel Um el Abbas,\r\nwhile a third is the =Wadi Hefeiri=, draining the hills round the\r\ngranite peak of the same name. All these tributaries, like Wadi\r\nRomit and Wadi Abu Ghusun itself, contain abundance of trees, and\r\nhave a rather rapid fall.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Hamata= drains the eastern flanks of the high hills north\r\nof Gebel Hamata, its principal heads being about latitude 24°\r\n15′. Only the heads of this wadi have been surveyed; it follows a\r\nwinding course among the lower hill country and reaches the sea in\r\nabout latitude 24° 24′.\r\n\r\nOf the three wadis draining seawards south of Hamata, called =Wadi\r\nHaratreit=, =Wadi Khashir=, and =Wadi Mikbi=, very little is known,\r\nnot even their heads having been visible from the stations which\r\nI occupied. The summits of the mountains drained by them have,\r\nhowever, been mapped, and their courses are approximately known from\r\nthe accounts of Floyer; these are indicated on the map probably in\r\nnearly their true positions. Draining mostly steep and precipitous\r\nmountain faces, the upper parts of these wadis must have an extremely\r\nrapid fall, and consequently a rough stony floor.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Lahami=, which enters the sea north of the peninsula of Ras\r\nBenas, is well known by reason of the easy pass over the main\r\nwatershed at its head forming an important means of access to\r\nBerenice from the west. At this point, four kilometres north-east\r\nof the white quartz cone called Marwot Elemikan, the watershed is\r\nsandy, level, and low, being only 590 metres above the sea. The\r\ndrop on crossing the watershed is fairly rapid, the wadi winding\r\nabout among the hills in a general north-easterly direction. About\r\nsix kilometres below its head, Lahami receives the =Wadi Um Karaba=,\r\nwhich drains the south face of Gebel Abu Gurdi. A little further on,\r\n=Wadi Eidab= enters from the south-east; this feeder is said to head\r\nin a rough steep pass over the hills into the Wadi Abu Daba. After\r\npassing between the high hills of Gebels Um Goradi and Um Gunud, Wadi\r\nLahami receives the short =Wadi Um Gunud=, in which there are two\r\nwell known galts, or rock basins forming reservoirs of rain water;\r\nthese contained good supplies in 1906-7. Lower down, Wadi Lahami\r\ncrosses a stony sloping plain, where it receives the drainage from\r\nthe north and east flanks of Gebel Abu Gurdi and from the mountains\r\nto the north of it, by a series of feeders, the principal of which\r\nare =Wadi Um Rishan=, =Wadi Um Homar=, and =Wadi Sefent=. East of\r\nthe plain there is a sort of shunt or loop-line of Wadi Lahami,\r\ncalled the =Wadi Abreik=, which is preferred to the main channel\r\nfor a road. Just receiving Wadi Sefent, Wadi Lahami turns sharply\r\neastward, and then north-eastward, receiving as feeders =Wadis Um\r\nKhuzama=, =Um Ghobasha=, and =Gumudlum=, draining Gebels Um Sellim\r\nand Gumudlum to the north; these feeders are said to contain natural\r\nreservoirs full of water after rain. From the south, Lahami is fed by\r\nthe =Wadis Um Eshub= and =Abu Marwa lil Lahami=, draining the lower\r\nhill country. The lower course of Wadi Lahami has not been traced in\r\ndetail. It passes north-west of the well marked granite peak called\r\nGebel Um Huk, as remarked above, and reaches the sea north of the\r\npeninsula of Ras Benas. To get to Berenice, one leaves Wadi Lahami\r\nabout twenty-four kilometres below the pass at its head, and turns\r\noff south-east up the tributary Wadi Abu Marwa, which leads to Wadi\r\nNaait by an easy road.\r\n\r\nWadi Lahami is well supplied with trees; it presented a very green\r\nappearance early in 1906, but the absence of rain for a year made\r\nit much more desolate looking in 1907, all the foliage being then\r\nblackened and withered. Its length is approximately fifty kilometres,\r\nits average slope twelve metres per kilometre, and the area of its\r\nbasin is about 650 square kilometres.\r\n\r\nThe drainage from the low hills on the =Peninsula of Ras Benas=,\r\nexcept for a small portion which joins Wadi Mukhit, reaches the sea\r\nby a multitude of small wadis, none of which bear special names. The\r\nhills being nearer to the south side of the peninsula than to the\r\nnorth, the wadis draining southwards are on the whole much shorter\r\nand steeper than those draining northwards, and the latter cross a\r\nsloping plain two or three kilometres wide to reach the sea. Passage\r\nacross the hills from south to north is only possible to camels at\r\na few places. The southern wadis are mostly barren, but the northern\r\nones contain abundance of a dark coloured grass of which camels are\r\nfond. There is no permanent water source on the peninsula, the nearest\r\nreliable source of supply being a galt in Wadi Mindeit, on the main\r\nland, about twelve kilometres west of Berenice. The tip of the low\r\nsandy projection of Ras Benas is marked by a sheikh’s tomb, one\r\nof the largest on the coast. It is chiefly built of wreckage cast\r\nup on the beach. From the hills it looks like a rectangular rock,\r\nand I determined its position by triangulation as latitude 23°\r\n53′ 50″ N., longitude 35° 47′ 13″ E. The sheikh’s memory\r\nappears to be greatly venerated by sailors, and several of my camel\r\nmen made pilgrimages to the tomb to pray.\r\n\r\nThe =Island of Mukawar=, about six kilometres south of the sandy tip\r\nof the ras, is nearly two kilometres in length from north to south. I\r\ndid not visit it, but it has the appearance of being made of coral;\r\nits highest point, near the south end, is thirty-four metres above\r\nthe sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Daba= drains the eastern flanks of Gebel Eidab and Gebel\r\nUm Maiat, and courses eastward through the lower hill country to\r\nthe coast plain, where it joins the drainage from Naait in Wadi\r\nMukhit. The principal feeder of Abu Daba is =Wadi Murra= which enters\r\nit from the south-west a few kilometres before its emergence on to\r\nthe plain. At the head of Wadi Abu Daba there is said to be a rough\r\nsteep pass over the mountains into Wadi Eidab. The place where Abu\r\nDaba debouches on to the coast plain is marked by a group of low\r\nbouldery looking granite hills called Khasheib Abu Daba.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Dibban= is a short wadi draining eastwards from the hills\r\nacross the coast plain to the sea a little north of Berenice. In its\r\ncourse across the plain it passes a little north of a conspicuous\r\ngranite hill called Sikeit, a well known landmark five kilometres\r\nnorth-west of Berenice.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Mindeit= drains the hills between Gebel Um Maiat and Gebel\r\nKalalat, entering the sea at Berenice.[91] =Wadi Um Sellim lil\r\nMindeit=, a shorter wadi coursing across the plain a little further\r\nsouth, is interesting as furnishing the nearest fresh water source\r\nto Berenice; it leads to a rock basin or galt among the hills, where\r\nrain water collects. This source is some ten or twelve kilometres\r\nfrom Berenice.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Naait=[92] is a narrow tortuous gorge, with a sandy floor\r\nshut in by high hills, coursing eastward to the coast plain a\r\nlittle south of the 24th parallel. Though only a small wadi some\r\nsixteen kilometres in length, it is well known because it forms\r\nthe usual road from Wadi Lahami to Berenice. Its actual head has\r\nnot been surveyed, but lies probably between the mountains of Um\r\nGunud and Um Hegilig. Its principal feeders are =Wadis Um Sumer=\r\nand =Abu Marwa lil Naait=, which enter it from the north-west, and\r\n=Wadi Abu Ghalqa=, entering from the north and draining the granite\r\nhills called Gebel Abu Ghalqa. All three of these feeders enter Naait\r\nnear together, some ten kilometres before it emerges on the plain;\r\nthe lower part of the wadi is free from lateral branches. The fall\r\nis ten metres per kilometre among the hills. On emerging from the\r\nhills on to the sandy coast plain, it joins an ill-defined drainage\r\nline called =Wadi el Mukhit=, which enters the sea at Port Berenice,\r\nsome fifteen kilometres further east. The name Wadi el Mukhit is also\r\ngiven to other ill-marked drainage lines entering Port Berenice from\r\nthe sandy tract between the hills of the main land and the hills\r\nof the peninsula of Ras Benas. Some three kilometres north-east\r\nof the mouth of Wadi Naait, on the coast plain, is a conspicuous\r\nisolated low hill, forming a well-known landmark and called =Grain el\r\nRih=. The plain drained by Wadi el Mukhit is a dreary sandy waste,\r\nand the crossing of it in a high wind is very trying by reason of\r\nthe immense clouds of sand raised and carried in the air.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Kalalat= heads in the north-west portion of Gebel Kalalat, and\r\ncourses nearly eastward to reach the sea in latitude 23° 52′. For\r\nthe first two-thirds of its course of about thirty kilometres,\r\nWadi Kalalat is shut in by high hills, and falls rather rapidly. At\r\nits head a rough steep pass is said to exist into the head of Wadi\r\nShut. After passing round the north flank of Gebel Kalalat, the wadi\r\nreceives two small tributaries called =Wadi Um Maiat= and =Wadi el\r\nDibag lil Batoga=, the former draining the north-east face of Gebel\r\nKalalat and the latter the north-west face of Gebel Batoga. After\r\nreceiving Wadi Dibag, the Wadi Kalalat makes a bend northward for\r\nabout two kilometres, then turns south-eastward to the opening of\r\nthe hills on the coast-plain. About two kilometres above the point\r\nwhere it leaves the hills, on the south side of the main wadi,\r\nis a rocky gully containing the =Galt Batoga= a rock basin which\r\ncontained good water in 1907 and which is very easy of access in\r\na few minutes from the main wadi. About one and a half kilometres\r\nfurther down, the small =Wadi Um Sellim=, draining the north-east\r\nparts of Gebel Batoga, joins the Wadi Kalalat just before it opens on\r\nto the coast-plain. The course of Wadi Kalalat from here to the sea,\r\nabout eleven kilometres, is ill-marked, over a sandy plain. A ruined\r\nenclosure of considerable size, called =Garia Kalalat=, lies close\r\nsouth of the wadi about seven kilometres from the sea.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um Goran= is a small wadi draining by many heads from the\r\neast face of Gebel Batoga and its foot hills to the sea in latitude\r\n23° 50′.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Kunserob=, draining the south parts of Gebels Kalalat and\r\nBatoga, courses at first nearly southwards, then curves round south\r\nof Gebel Dibag, and after receiving =Wadi Dibag lil Kunserob= from\r\nthe north-west, proceeds eastward through the hills and across six\r\nkilometres of sandy coast-plain to the sea in latitude 23° 47′.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Berigâ= is a short drainage line from among the hills to\r\nthe sea, a little south of Wadi Kunserob.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Khoda= is an important main drainage channel some forty-five\r\nkilometres in length, coursing a little north of eastward to reach\r\nthe sea in latitude 23° 43′. For the greater part of its length\r\nit is shut in by high hills, only the last six kilometres being\r\nacross the sandy coast-plain. With a basin approximately 780 square\r\nkilometres in area, it drains the mountains of Abu Dahr, Dahanib,\r\nShut, Reyan, Shenshef, Hindia, and Um Akra, some of which rise to\r\nover 1,000 metres above the sea; it thus receives a fair amount of\r\nwater in rainy years, and is well supplied with trees and bushes. Its\r\naverage fall is about nine metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\nThe head of Wadi Khoda is formed by the union of three wadis,\r\ncoming approximately from the north, west, and south, in the form\r\nof a cross. The central one of these, =Wadi Abu Debebi lil Khoda=,\r\nheads in a very easy pass leading to Bir Betan and the old mines\r\nof Um Eleiga. The one to the north, =Wadi Salib el Abiad=, is said\r\nto lead into Wadi Khiua, and to possess some old mines, but has not\r\nbeen explored. The remaining one of the three, =Wadi Salib el Azrak=,\r\ndrains the east face of Gebel Abu Dahr and the high hills east of\r\nit; the feeder of it from Abu Dahr, called =Wadi Um Karaba=, leads\r\nby an easy pass, just north of the mountain, to Bir Betan and the\r\nUm Eleiga mines, while some eight kilometres from its junction with\r\nKhoda a track leads up a gully south-westward over another easy pass\r\nto Bir Rahaba. The names Salib el Abiad and Salib el Azrak refer to\r\nthe form of the wadis and the nature of their floor, _salib_ meaning\r\n“cross,” while _abiad_ and _azrak_ refer to the prevailing white\r\nand dark colours of the sand in the respective arms of the cross;\r\nthese colours are due to the wadis draining light-coloured granites\r\nand dark-coloured serpentines and schists respectively.\r\n\r\nA little below the union of the three arms above-mentioned, Wadi\r\nKhoda expands into a small rather stony plain, where the sinuous\r\n=Wadi Allawi=[93] enters from the north. This important feeder,\r\nwhich drains the eastern face of Gebel Dahanib, is mostly shut in\r\nby high hills, and is relatively well wooded; if it be followed up\r\nfor about ten kilometres, one comes to the tomb of Sheikh Farhan,\r\nnear which meet many small feeders, one of them containing a small\r\nrock basin near its head.\r\n\r\nAbout eight kilometres below the point of entry of Wadi Allawi,\r\nWadi Khoda receives two feeders from opposite sides; that from the\r\nnorth, =Wadi Um Tawil lil Khoda=, drains from Gebel Dahanib, while\r\nthat from the south, =Wadi Hindia=, is a sandy rapidly-falling wadi\r\ndraining Gebel Hindia.\r\n\r\nSome five kilometres further down, =Wadi Um Akra=, draining the\r\nmountains of the same name, enters Khoda from the south, while another\r\ntwo kilometres brings us to the place of influx of =Wadi Shut=, an\r\nimportant feeder from the north. The head of Wadi Shut is on the west\r\nside of Gebel Kalalat, whence its course is westward for about ten\r\nkilometres; it is then joined by the =Wadi Abu Hugban=, coming from\r\nthe south-west, and from this point it runs south-south-east for some\r\ntwenty-three kilometres to its junction with Wadi Khoda. Wadi Shut is\r\na rather wide wadi with a sandy floor, fed by many tributaries from\r\nthe mountains of Dahanib, Um Hegilig, Reyan, and Shut. Its principal\r\nfeeder in the lower part of its course is =Wadi Um Tawil lil Shut=,\r\nwhich drains the south part of Gebel Dahanib and enters Shut from\r\nthe west about five kilometres above its junction with Khoda. The\r\nWadi Shut has a fair growth of trees, and is said to possess also\r\na large water source, the exact locality of which has not, however,\r\nbeen ascertained.[94]\r\n\r\nJust below the place where Wadi Shut joins it, Wadi Khoda receives\r\na small feeder called =Wadi Um Gubur=, entering from the north\r\nand marked by several graves near its mouth. On the other side,\r\ntwo kilometres further on, =Wadi Shib= enters from the south, and\r\nfive kilometres further the =Wadi Um Seyal lil Khoda= enters Khoda\r\nfrom the north.\r\n\r\nThe =Wadi Gumudlum=, the next great feeder of Khoda, enters from the\r\nnorth four kilometres below Wadi Um Seyal. It is a wadi some eighteen\r\nkilometres in length, coursing south-south-east, and having its head\r\non the west side of Gebel Kalalat. A little below wadi Gumudlum,\r\nnear a boss of white quartz, several small feeders, of which the two\r\nprincipal are called =Wadi Buluk= and =Wadi Um Lassaf=, enter Wadi\r\nKhoda from the south; these drain the north side of the high hills\r\ncalled Gebel Um Etli.\r\n\r\nThe last feeder of Wadi Khoda, the =Wadi Shenshef=, enters the main\r\nwadi some three kilometres above the place where it debouches on\r\nto the coast-plain, or eight kilometres from the coast. It is a\r\nnarrow and very tortuous gorge winding among high hills. If it be\r\nfollowed up for about ten kilometres, one comes to several small\r\nwells called =Bir Shenshef=, which contained water in 1907, and a\r\nlittle above the wells, where the wadi becomes more open, there are\r\nruins, called =Hitan Shenshef=, which attest the former existence\r\nof a town or large village. The ruins are on both sides of the wadi,\r\nand many of them are extremely well built of slabs of quartz schist;\r\nbesides the houses in the wadi itself, there are small towers on\r\nthe hills. As there are apparently no mines in the hills here, the\r\norigin of the ruins is not clear; from the strong situation and the\r\nwatch towers, and its proximity to fresh water and the sea, it may\r\npossibly represent an old slave dealer’s stronghold.\r\n\r\nFor some eighteen kilometres south of the Wadi Khoda, the seaward\r\ndrainages have not been explored, but they are believed to be only\r\nshort wadis, as the high mountains of Faraid are here only about\r\nten kilometres from the coast. From guides’ statements, the =Wadi\r\nUm Etli=, coursing eastward and draining the south faces of Gebel\r\nUm Etli, enters the sea in about latitude 23° 38′, and there is\r\nprobably at least one other short wadi draining to the sea about in\r\nlatitude 23° 35′ from the north part of Gebel Faraid. The sandy\r\ncoast-plain in this region is about five kilometres wide.\r\n\r\nThe =Wadi el Sorubiab=, draining from the north part of Gebel Faraid,\r\nand the =Wadi Bint el Kurdum=, draining the mountains around the\r\nremarkable “Bodkin” peak, enter the sea together by way of a\r\nsmall lagoon in latitude 23° 30′. Another wadi, for which I could\r\nnot obtain any name from my guides, drains the extreme south parts\r\nof Gebel Faraid and the north slopes of the smaller Gebel Fereyid,\r\nentering the sea in about latitude 23° 19′.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Rahaba=, with a basin of about 900 square kilometres in area,\r\ndrains the country between Gebels Faraid and Abu Dahr. From its\r\nhead, situated about six kilometres south-east of Gebel Abu Dahr,\r\nthere is an easy pass into Wadi Salib el Azrak, a tributary of\r\nWadi Khoda. About three kilometres below its head, a feeder called\r\n=Wadi Titai= enters Rahaba from the hill country to the east; and\r\na kilometre lower down, another feeder called =Wadi Abu Nikheil=,\r\ncomes in from the west. At this point there is an important well,\r\n=Bir Rahaba=, sunk in the alluvium of the wadi floor; this is said\r\nto yield good summer supplies, but was filled up by downwash when I\r\nvisited it early in 1907. Some three kilometres below Bir Rahaba,\r\na tributary called =Wadi Abu Reye= enters Wadi Rahaba from the\r\nnorth-west; and there is said to be a well, called =Bir Abu Reye=,\r\nabout one and a half kilometres up this wadi. Another feeder, the\r\n=Wadi Um Buerat=, joins Rahaba from the south-west a little further\r\non, and then the wadi, which has thus far taken a southerly course,\r\nturns south-east, winding considerably for some eight kilometres\r\ntill it is joined by its most important feeder, the Wadi el Abiad.\r\n\r\nThis =Wadi el Abiad= drains the western side of the northern peaks of\r\nGebel Faraid, and derives its name from the white granitic sand which\r\nforms its floor. It has a length of some twenty kilometres and is fed\r\nby the =Rod Elbel=, which heads in a sandy plain at the foot of the\r\nhighest peak of Faraid, and by the =Wadi Abu Ribian=, which collects\r\nthe drainage from the lower hill country west of the Bodkin peak.\r\n\r\nAbout three kilometres lower down than the point of influx of Wadi el\r\nAbiad, Wadi Rahaba receives the =Wadi Megah= as a tributary from the\r\nnorth-west; a well, called =Bir el Gahlia= is said to exist at the\r\nhead of this wadi, about twelve kilometres up from its opening into\r\nWadi Rahaba. Some six kilometres further down, Wadi Rahaba opens out;\r\nits course down to this point has been shut in by high hills, but now\r\nbecomes an ill-marked drainage line over a sandy plain. The plain is\r\nbroken by small hills, and is limited east and west by other hills\r\nwhich increase in height further away, forming in fact the foot-hills\r\nof Gebels Orga and Um Tenebda on the west and of Gebel Faraid on the\r\neast. In this part of its course Rahaba receives several tributaries,\r\nthe principal being =Wadi Hutit= from the north-west, =Wadi Dagalai\r\nlil Rahaba= and =Wadi Abu Had= from the east, and =Wadi el Marafai=,\r\nwhich runs for some ten kilometres nearly parallel to Wadi Rahaba,\r\namong low hills two or three kilometres east of the main Wadi,\r\njoining the latter about due west of Gebel Fereyid.\r\n\r\nWadi Rahaba curves round to the south of Gebel Fereyid in a quadrant\r\nof about seven kilometres radius, and then proceeds nearly due east\r\nto reach the sea in about latitude 23° 12′.\r\n\r\nThe upper parts of Wadi Rahaba, where it is shut in by high hills,\r\ncontain many trees and bushes; but the lower parts are more barren\r\nand sandy, the actual drainage line being in places difficult to\r\ndefine on account of the paucity of vegetation and the openness\r\nof the plain. The total length is about seventy-five kilometres,\r\nand the total fall 450 metres; the slope averages eight metres per\r\nkilometre in the upper twenty-five kilometres, where the wadi is\r\nnarrow and shut in, but only five metres per kilometre in the broad\r\nand sandy course which forms the remaining fifty kilometres.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Hodein=, one of the largest and most important of the\r\nseawards draining wadis of the Eastern Desert, has a basin of\r\nnearly 12,000 square kilometres, or over a square degree of the\r\nearth’s surface. Its main channel, formed by the union of the\r\nWadis Arned, el Sania, Um Sumur, Saalek, Um Reit, and el Nom, in\r\nlatitude 23° 18′, longitude 34° 43′, and reaching the sea\r\nat Bir Shalatein[95] in latitude 23° 8′, longitude 35° 37′,\r\nhas a length of 108 kilometres and an average slope of three metres\r\nper kilometre. For the first fifteen kilometres of its course it is\r\nshut in by the high sandstone scarps of Gebel Abraq and Gebel Hodein;\r\nbut shortly after passing the Abu Saafa Springs its channel becomes\r\nwide and sandy, passing through lower metamorphic hill country;\r\nand in the last twenty-five or thirty kilometres of its course it is\r\nmerely an ill-defined drainage line over the sandy coast-plain. Its\r\nlower reaches are dreary and inhospitable, but its upper-portion\r\nis pleasantly wooded, and contains the perennial springs of Abu\r\nSaafa. Wadi Hodein is remarkable for the large number and length of\r\nits tributary wadis, some of which exceed the main channel itself in\r\nlength, while many of them contain wells and form important lines of\r\ncommunication by leading to easy passes over the main watershed. In\r\nthe description which follows, I shall first consider the wadis which\r\nby their union form the head of the main channel, afterwards tracing\r\nthe course of the main wadi in detail to the sea, noting the influx\r\nof the various tributaries on either hand, and finally describing\r\nthe larger tributaries themselves.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the wadis which join to form the head of Wadi\r\nHodein are Wadis Arned, Saalek, and Um Reit. These join in a small\r\nplain with the =Wadis el Sania=, =Um Sumur= and =El Nom=, which are\r\nsmaller and will not need further mention.\r\n\r\n=Wadi el Arned= originates on the main watershed about five kilometres\r\nsouth-east of Galt el Aguz. The watershed here is only 427 metres\r\nabove sea-level, and is so flat and sandy that it is almost impossible\r\nto say within a kilometre where the divide actually is; the wadi\r\nin fact heads in a sandy plain about two kilometres wide with low\r\nsandstone hills on either hand, from which feeders join the main\r\ndrainage line. About six kilometres below its head, Wadi Arned\r\nis joined from the south by its most important feeder, the =Wadi\r\nMuegil=. This wadi, which has a length of some twenty kilometres,\r\noriginates in the hill country about nine kilometres north of\r\nGebel Um Reit, where an easy pass connects it with Wadi Saalek;\r\nit flows in a northerly direction, entirely among sandstone hills,\r\nand is fairly provided with vegetation. Some two kilometres lower\r\ndown, Arned receives a smaller feeder from the north, called =Wadi\r\nUm Arta=; by following this up for about five kilometres, one can\r\nreach a rather steep and sandy eastward pass into the head of Wadi\r\nSilsila, and this forms the shortest route from the Galt el Aguz\r\nto the springs of Abraq. About four kilometres below the junction\r\nof Wadi Abu Arta, near an isolated hill on the east side of the\r\nWadi Arned, there appears to be another opening into one of the\r\nheads of Wadi Silsila; this opening is very sandy and looks like a\r\npracticable alternative route to Abraq Springs, though it has not\r\nbeen explored. Lower down its course, Wadi Arned is at first very\r\nsandy and bare, with high sand-drifts swathing the feet of the hills\r\non the east; but it gradually narrows into a gorge and becomes less\r\nsandy, then opens out again, and near its junction with Wadi Hodein\r\nit contains abundant vegetation. The Wadi Arned forms the easiest\r\nand most direct road from Abu Saafa to Daraw, _via_ Galt el Aguz,\r\nBir Abu Hashim, and Bir Qoleib.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Saalek= is a short wadi with many feeders, draining the hills\r\nround Gebel Saalek; one of its northern feeders leads to a pass into\r\nthe head of Wadi Muegil, while one of its south branches heads in\r\na pass leading round the west side of Gebel Um Reit to Wadi and Bir\r\nUm Reit.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um Reit= heads in the granite mountain called Gebel Um Reit\r\nand flows north-eastward, to the south of the mountain, for about\r\ntwenty-two kilometres, to its junction with Arned and Saalek to form\r\nWadi Hodein. The head of Wadi Um Reit leads to a pass north-west of\r\nthe mountain into Wadi Saalek, while the western head of Um Reit,\r\nwhich bears the name =Wadi el Dub=, leads on to a sandy plain\r\nforming the main watershed, whence there are easy tracks to the\r\nvarious feeders of Wadi Timsah. The well called =Bir Um Reit= is\r\na deep excavation, in the wadi floor at the foot of the mountain,\r\nnear a large tree. Dr. Hume, who visited it in 1906, found it to\r\nyield water of only mediocre character. It is about one hundred\r\nkilometres by road from Bir Abu Hashim, the nearest well to the\r\nwest, but only about thirty kilometres from Abu Saafa Springs,\r\nthe nearest water eastward; to get to Abu Saafa from Bir Um Reit,\r\none has only to follow down the wadi, and the supply at Abu Saafa\r\ncan always be relied on for quantity and quality. Near the well,\r\nWadi Um Reit receives feeders draining the high granite hills of\r\nEtresia; the principal of these is called =Wadi Malhat=. The lower\r\npart of the course of Um Reit is almost entirely in sandstone hills;\r\nit has not been mapped in detail except near its junction with Hodein.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the main channel of Wadi Hodein, which originates,\r\nas above-mentioned, by the union of the Wadis Um Reit, Saalek,\r\nArned, and other smaller wadis in a small plain, and shall follow\r\nits course onwards to the sea. Three small feeders, =Talet Um Danaqa=\r\nand =Talet Kurit= on the south, and =Talet Um Sideri= on the north,\r\njoin the channel a few kilometres below its head, while about nine\r\nkilometres from the head there enters a larger wadi coming from\r\nthe south, called the =Wadi el Gihab=. The main Wadi Gihab has not\r\nbeen followed, but its eastern branch, called =Wadi Gihab Abu Derb=,\r\ncontains a large and very easily accessible galt about four kilometres\r\nfrom Hodein, and leads about ten kilometres further on, to a very\r\nsteep and difficult pass into Wadi Dif; this pass is practicable\r\nonly on foot, being risky even for unladen camels.\r\n\r\nThe =Springs of Abu Saafa= are situated in the Wadi Hodein, about two\r\nkilometres below the point of influx of Wadi Gihab, at an altitude of\r\n310 metres above sea-level. The Wadi Hodein is here narrow, and shut\r\nin by very high steep sandstone scarps. There are four springs, all\r\nissuing from the northern scarp at intervals of about sixty metres\r\nalong the wadi, and all about three metres above the wadi floor,\r\ntrickling into pools about a metre in diameter close by. The most\r\nwesterly of the four springs is a mere trickle; the next yields a\r\nrather greater flow, from a carved niche in the rock, with a Greek\r\ncornice; the third is the one most used, having the greatest flow\r\nof the four, while the easternmost is almost stagnant and has yellow\r\nincrustations near it. The rate of flow, even from the largest spring,\r\nis very slow, probably not more than ten litres per minute, and\r\nthe overflow from the pools is only a tiny stream a few centimetres\r\nwide which soon loses itself in the sand of the wadi floor; but the\r\npools are large enough for a dozen or more camels to drink from, and\r\nsoon fill up again when emptied. The water is of excellent quality,\r\nvery clear, and the supply never fails. Near the springs there are\r\nfive or six small date palms, and the wadi hereabouts has many other\r\ntrees. After rain, this part of Wadi Hodein at times becomes a stream;\r\nthis was the case in October 1907, for I found numerous pools in the\r\nwadi floor, and scum and froth showing that an impetuous stream about\r\nhalf a metre deep had flowed down the wadi only a few days prior to my\r\nvisit. Just below Abu Saafa Springs, Wadi Hodein receives the short\r\n=Wadi Maghal= from the north-west; this wadi, which is walled in by\r\nhigh sandstone plateaux, contains water holes about three kilometres\r\nfrom Wadi Hodein; but these are less important than the springs of\r\nAbu Saafa, and are, moreover, off the main road.\r\n\r\nWadi Hodein now opens out, the high sandstone scarps of Gebels Abraq\r\nand Hodein running north and south-east, and enters a sandy plain\r\nwith very low hills, from among which some small feeders join the\r\nmain wadi. About fifteen kilometres below the opening of scarps,\r\nWadi Hodein receives, from the north-west, the Wadi Naam,[96] a\r\ngreat tributary draining the mountains of Zergat Naam, Um Bisilla,\r\nand Abu Dahr. The next influx is from Wadi Dif, which enters Wadi\r\nHodein from the south-west about six kilometres further on; Wadi\r\nDif itself is only a short wadi, but it collects the drainage\r\nof an immense area to the south by long feeders, and contains a\r\ngood well. Nearly opposite to Wadi Dif, the =Wadi Orga el Atshani=\r\njoins Wadi Hodein from the north-west; the Wadi Hodein has here two\r\nlarge island-like masses of low hills in it, between which the main\r\ndrainage line passes. Lower down, =Wadi Orga el Rayani= enters by two\r\nmouths from the north. Both the Wadis Orga are said to originate near\r\nGebel Orga, some thirty kilometres to the north, but their courses\r\nhave not been mapped; the one called El Rayani is said to lead to\r\na good well, =Bir Orga=, about twelve or fourteen kilometres above\r\nits junction with Hodein. On the opposite (south) side, Wadi Hodein\r\nreceives the Wadi Anfeib, draining the high sandstone plateau of\r\nGebel Anfeib. A little further on the small =Wadi el Khasiya= comes\r\nin from the north, by two channels, one on either side of a small\r\ngroup of isolated hills; and nearly opposite is the mouth of Wadi\r\nMadi, which drains the west side of the great mountain mass of Gerf,\r\nsome sixty kilometres to the south, and possesses a good well about\r\nfifty kilometres up its course from Wadi Hodein. Several feeders come\r\nin from the north a little further down the wadi, of which the chief\r\nis the =Wadi Um Tenedba=, draining the mountain of the same name,\r\nwhile others drain the hill country round Gebel Harhagit. On the other\r\n(south) side is the mouth of Wadi Khashab, draining the west side of\r\nGebel Khashab and the hills west of it. A few kilometres further on,\r\nWadi Hodein widens considerably, and from here onward it is very\r\nsandy and arid. A long spur running north-west from Gebel el Anbat\r\nnearly cuts across the wadi, the main channel of which passes north\r\nand east of the spur, while to the west of it is a rather broad sandy\r\nplain with ill-marked drainage lines from the hills, of which the\r\nchief bears the name of =Wadi Um Seleim=. Near Gebel el Anbat are\r\nnumerous small feeders of Wadi Hodein from that hill and the other\r\nhills to the north-east. About eight kilometres below Gebel el Anbat,\r\nWadi Hodein quits the hills and, turning a little north of east,\r\nmerges into the coast-plain, over which its remaining course of about\r\ntwenty-seven kilometres is very ill-defined. Just where it leaves\r\nthe hills, Wadi Hodein is joined from the south-west by Wadi Beida,\r\ndraining the mountain of the same name and containing two wells;\r\nand a little further on it receives Wadi el Kreiga, which drains the\r\nhill country round Bir Meneiga. The junctions of Wadi Beida and Wadi\r\nKreiga with Wadi Hodein are very difficult to trace on the ground,\r\nbeing almost lost in the general sandy plain.\r\n\r\n=Bir Shalatein=, a very salt well in the Wadi Hodein, about two\r\nkilometres from its mouth and only about seven metres above the sea,\r\nis chiefly of importance by reason of its marking the administrative\r\nlimit of the Egyptian and Sudan spheres of government. It is merely\r\na few shallow pits sunk in the wadi bed, yielding water drinkable\r\nonly by camels. An iron beacon two metres high has been erected on\r\na low bank close to the well, and will enable the well, which is\r\nitself inconspicuous, to be easily found.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Naam=, a great tributary of Wadi Hodein coming from the\r\nnorth-north-west, originates about ten kilometres south-east of\r\nGebel Zergat Naam by the union of the Wadis Abu Seyal, El Fil, and Um\r\nBisilla, and courses south-south-east for about forty-nine kilometres\r\nto its junction with Wadi Hodein. It is a very barren wadi, being\r\nfor most of its length a broad, shallow, and very sandy drainage\r\nline among low hills, and in its lower parts, where it crosses the\r\nplain of Abraq, its course is very ill-marked. Its slope decreases\r\nfrom five metres per kilometre near its head to about three metres\r\nper kilometre in its lower reaches. Besides the three wadis which,\r\nas above-mentioned, unite to form its head, Wadi Naam has several\r\nlarge tributaries, of which the chief are the Wadis Silsila and Abraq\r\non the west, and Wadis Erf Um Araka, Arais, and Betan on the east.\r\n\r\nThe =Wadi el Fil=, which may be regarded as the main head of Wadi\r\nNaam, though it is not the longest, drains the north-east portion of\r\nGebel Zergat Naam (sometimes called Hagar el Fil). The rocky gullies\r\nforming its heads contain rock basins which yield water for a short\r\ntime after rain.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Seyal= drains the south part of the same range; its head\r\nis very steep, and is said to contain a very large galt, which holds\r\nsupplies of water for five months after rain.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um Bisilla= drains Gebel Um Bisilla, which it half encircles,\r\nits main head being north-east of the mountain, where there is an\r\neasy pass into Wadi Abu Nilih, and thence an easy road to the head of\r\nWadi Lahami. About eleven kilometres west of the mountain, Wadi Um\r\nBisilla receives, from the north-east, the =Wadi el Khiua=, which,\r\nwith its tributaries, =Wadis Abu Fagir= and =Abu Nilih=, drains the\r\nlow hill country north of Gebel Um Bisilla. The lower parts of Wadis\r\nUm Bisilla and Khiua have not been surveyed in detail; their courses\r\nas shown on the map are only approximate, but being based on guides’\r\nstatements near the spot they are probably substantially correct.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Erf Um Araka= heads as a series of small wadis among the low\r\nhills south of Um Bisilla, and curves round westward between the\r\nhigh hills of Abu Shigelat and Erf el Gimal on the north, and Erf Um\r\nAraka or Gebel Belamhandeit on the south, to join Wadi Naam about\r\nfive kilometres lower down than Wadi Um Bisilla. The hill country\r\nround the heads of Wadi Erf Um Araka is fairly open, so that one\r\ncan proceed freely from the head of Wadi Arais, across those of Wadi\r\nErf Um Araka, and on into the heads of Wadi Um Bisilla.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Arais= originates by the union of many small feeders in the low\r\nhill country between Gebels Um Guruf and Hendusi, and courses for the\r\nfirst fourteen kilometres in a south-south-west direction. About nine\r\nkilometres below its head the =Wadi Um Guruf=, draining the hills\r\nround the conspicuous granite boss called Gebel Um Guruf, enters\r\nfrom the north-west. Some five kilometres further on, just beyond the\r\nplace where Arais makes a sharp westward bend, =Wadi Belamhandeit=,\r\ndraining the east face of the long gneiss range called Erf Um Araka or\r\nGebel Belamhandeit, enters from the north. Wadi Arais now narrows into\r\na winding gorge, cutting westward for about ten kilometres through\r\nthe complex of high gneiss hills called Gebel Arais to join Wadi\r\nNaam. Its junction with Wadi Naam takes place in a small plain, with\r\nthe sandstone plateaux of Gebel Um Sididad on the west and the gneiss\r\nhills of Gebel Arais on the east. The fall of Wadi Arais is from 464\r\nmetres above sea at the pass into Wadi Erf Um Araka, to 345 metres\r\nwhere it joins Wadi Naam after a course of twenty-five kilometres;\r\nso that its slope averages four and a half metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Silsila=[97] heads in high sandstone hills on the meridian\r\nof 34° 40′, north of Gebel Abraq, where at least one pass, steep\r\nand sandy, leads to the Wadi Arned. Its course is almost due east,\r\nover a plain with low sandstone banks, with a great deal of blown\r\nsand. Feeders enter it from the sandstone hills which bound the plain,\r\nthe principal being the =Wadi Um Sididad=, draining the high sandstone\r\nhills, called Gebel Um Sididad, on the north. About seven kilometres\r\nbefore it joins Naam, Wadi Silsila cuts through the range of low\r\nsandstone hills which stretches southward from Gebel Um Sididad to\r\nnear Abraq springs; in proceeding to Abraq from the pass at the head\r\nof Wadi Silsila, one bears off to the south before reaching this\r\nrange, entering the drainage of Wadi Abraq over an open sandy plain.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abraq= is a rather ill-defined drainage line which originates\r\non the north side of Gebel Abraq, and after skirting the high\r\nsandstone scarp, from which it receives small feeders, for about\r\nthirteen kilometres, turns eastward to join Wadi Naam, about nine\r\nkilometres above its junction with Hodein. Wadi Abraq is sandy and\r\nbarren, and would be scarcely worthy of mention but for the fact\r\nthat it contains some of the most important water sources of the\r\nentire Eastern Desert, the =Abraq Springs=. There are no less than\r\nfive springs within a length of as many kilometres of the wadi,\r\nyielding perennial supplies of excellent water.\r\n\r\nThe first spring from the north, called =Bir el Sunta=, is a pool\r\nabout two metres in diameter at the entrance to a little gully in\r\nthe face of the high sandstone scarp; it is very easily accessible\r\nto camels, being practically on the plain, and fills as rapidly as\r\nit is emptied. The second and third springs, called together =Bir\r\nAbu Dibesat=, are about 1,500 metres south-east of Bir el Sunta,\r\nnear the tomb of Sheikh Hamid; they form smaller pools at the foot\r\nof the scarp. The fourth spring, =Bir Abraq=, is situated a short\r\ndistance up a stony gully which emerges from the scarp a little\r\nfurther south; the water lies in large pools under dipping sandstone\r\nbeds on the south side of the gully. The fifth spring, =Bir Gumbit=,\r\nis said to be some three kilometres further south-east, and, like\r\nthe others, at the foot of the sandstone scarp; it has not, however,\r\nbeen visited by the survey party.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—Map of Abraq Springs. Scale: 5 centimetres\r\nto a kilometre.]\r\n\r\nThe water at all the Abraq Springs is of excellent quality; it\r\ncontains masses of green algæ, but these are easily avoided in baling\r\nout, and the water can be obtained quite clear. Of the four springs\r\nvisited, the one called Bir Abraq is the chief; but Bir el Sunta\r\nis rather easier of access for camels. The springs are practically\r\nall at the same level, _viz._, 330 metres above sea, and all derive\r\ntheir water from the same sandstone beds. No camel food grows near the\r\nwells, and there are very few trees in the vicinity; consequently, the\r\nArabs of the neighbourhood do not camp near the springs, but in Wadi\r\nHodein and its tributaries, drawing water from Abraq or Abu Saafa at\r\nintervals. There are, however, ruins of a large ancient fort on a low\r\nhill east of Bir Abraq, and some Arab graves a little further north;\r\namong these latter is a large tomb said to be that of Sheikh Hamid.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Betan= originates on the north side of Gebel Abu Dahr, where an\r\neasy pass, 610 metres above sea-level, connects its head with Wadi\r\nUm Karaba, and courses at first westward to near Gebel Hendusi; it\r\nthen turns southward to join Wadi Naam a few kilometres only above its\r\njunction with Wadi Hodein. Its total length is over fifty kilometres,\r\nand its average slope is about seven metres per kilometre. Only the\r\nhead of Wadi Betan has been surveyed in detail; but this is the most\r\nimportant part, as containing water sources and old mine workings;\r\nand the lower part of its course as shown on the map is probably\r\nsubstantially correct, being based on statements made near the spot\r\nby guides familiar with the district.\r\n\r\nAbout five kilometres below its head, Wadi Betan contains the two\r\nwells called =Bir Betan=. These are excavations in the alluvium of\r\nthe wadi. The lower one is at the mouth of the small Wadi Um Eleiga,\r\nwhile the other is about 600 metres further up Wadi Betan, close to a\r\nsmall tree. Both these wells were filled up by downwash when I visited\r\nthem in February 1907, and their places were only recognisable by the\r\nclay “hôds” near them; at this time there was no necessity for\r\nthe Arabs to open them, as a galt at the head of the wadi, just south\r\nof the pass into Wadi Um Karaba, was yielding a good supply of water.\r\n\r\nJust above the wells, Betan receives from the south the feeder\r\ncalled =Wadi Mistura=, draining the west side of Gebel Abu Dahr. The\r\nlittle =Wadi Um Eleiga=, which drains into Betan close to the south\r\nwell, is of importance as leading to some extensive ruins and old\r\nworkings about two kilometres up from its mouth. The ruins are mostly\r\nrubble hovels, while the workings, which were evidently for gold,\r\nvary from mere scratchings to pits ten metres deep in the rock. A\r\ndiorite mill-stone is to be seen near the ruins.\r\n\r\nThe =Wadi Abu Debebi lil Betan=, which joins Betan on the north about\r\nthree kilometres below the wells, leads by an easy pass into =Wadi\r\nAbu Debebi lil Khoda=, one of the heads of Wadi Khoda, and forms\r\nthe nearest way to the coast from Bir Betan. =Wadi Abu Sieiyil=\r\nis a small feeder entering Betan from the south, three kilometres\r\nfurther down. The principal remaining tributaries of Betan are the\r\nWadis Hefeiri, Abu Beid, and Egat. =Wadi Hefeiri= runs westward\r\nfrom near the Abu Debebi pass, and turning south near Gebel Hendusi,\r\nreceives the =Rod el Hendusi= just before entering Betan. =Wadi Abu\r\nBeid el Azrak= originates near Gebel Abu Sieiyil west of Abu Dahr,\r\nand flows southwards to join =Wadi Abu Beid el Abiad=, which in turn\r\nflows into Wadi Betan. A well, =Bir Abu Beid=, is situated near the\r\njunction of Wadi Abu Beid el Abiad and Wadi Abu Beid el Azrak, where\r\nthere are numerous seyal trees; it was yielding a fair quantity of\r\ngood water in 1906. Of the =Wadi Egat=, nothing has been seen; it\r\nis, however, stated by the Arabs to originate in the rugged hilly\r\ntract south of Gebel Abu Dahr, and to join Wadi Betan lower down\r\nits course than Abu Beid.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Dif= originates in the sandstone hills round Bir Dif, and\r\npursues a very sinuous north-easterly course, cutting through the\r\nhigh sandstone plateau which is named Gebel Hodein to the north,\r\nand Gebel Dif to the south of it. For the major part of its length\r\nof twenty-nine kilometres it is very narrow, with very high steep\r\nsandstone scarps on either side, but it is a little more open near\r\nits origin, where Wadi Feqoh joins it, and in its lower part it\r\nwinds as a broad sandy valley through the low hills which separate\r\nthe Wadi Hodein from the high sandstone plateaux; it joins Wadi\r\nHodein close to the meridian of 35°. Except the Wadi Feqoh, which\r\nis of immense length, and drains a very large area, Wadi Dif has\r\nonly a few insignificant feeders. Of these, =Talet Um Karaba= and\r\n=Wadi Enqireidia= enter from the south plateau near the place where\r\nWadi Dif leaves the high sandstone hills; and =Wadi Gelabat Shabai=,\r\ncoursing north-east through the low hill country flanking the plateau,\r\njoins Wadi Dif just above its junction with Hodein.\r\n\r\n=Bir Dif= is situated in a small gully forming the head of Wadi Dif,\r\nin latitude 23° 12′ 42″. To a traveller coming up Wadi Dif,\r\nWadi Feqoh forms the main continuation of Wadi Dif, and the gully\r\ncontaining Bir Dif appears to be a lateral tributary coming in\r\nfrom the west; but the Arabs restrict the name Dif to the drainage\r\nline below the spring, and apply the name Feqoh to all the upper\r\nmain channel. Bir Dif is a spring forming two pools of good water,\r\nsituated about a kilometre up the gully, at the junction of sandstone\r\nand schists. The approach to the pools is very stony, but camels\r\ncan easily reach the water; the spring is 290 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Feqoh=, a tributary of Wadi Dif, is many times longer than\r\nWadi Dif itself, and even longer than the Wadi Hodein of which Wadi\r\nDif is a tributary, having a length along its main channel of 150\r\nkilometres, with feeders totalling several times that length. Though\r\nonly portions of Wadi Feqoh have been surveyed in detail, the\r\nposition of its entire course is known with tolerable accuracy from\r\nthe statements of guides at various stations from which portions\r\nof it could be pointed out. It is for the most part a very barren\r\nwadi, forming an ill-defined drainage line through a dreary waterless\r\nsandy waste. Its very name, which means “devoid of nourishment,”\r\nindicates its character. It originates near the west side of Gebel\r\nSoaorib, only some twenty kilometres north of the 22nd parallel of\r\nlatitude, where the main watershed separates it from the feeders\r\nof the Wadi Alaqi. From here it follows a north-westerly course,\r\npassing between the mountains of Eir Arib and Hadal Derqa. Curving\r\nslightly to the north, it crosses the great sandy plain west of Gebel\r\nKorabkansi, and passes close west of the isolated mountain called\r\nGebel Shabih. Further on, it enters a country of low hills with sandy\r\ninterspaces, passing close west of the low range called Gebel Um el\r\nKalala, and then sweeps round in a great curve towards the east to\r\njoin the Wadi Dif close to Bir Dif. The fall of its bed from near\r\nGebel Shabih to its junction with Wadi Dif, that is, in a length of\r\nseventy-two kilometres, is from 470 metres to 280 metres above sea,\r\ngiving an average slope of only about 2·6 metres per kilometre;\r\nWadi Feqoh has in fact the most gentle gradient of all the great\r\nseawards-draining wadis.\r\n\r\nWadi Feqoh has many tributaries. Those near its head, and others\r\ncoming in from the western mountains through the low hill country\r\nnorth of Gebel Mishbih, have not been traced; but those draining Gebel\r\nKorabkansi and Gebel Niqrub, which are probably the most important,\r\nhave been mapped in detail. Most of the drainage from these localities\r\neventually finds its way into the great trunk feeder of Wadi Feqoh,\r\ncalled the =Wadi Gimal=,[98] which joins Wadi Feqoh about sixteen\r\nkilometres before its junction with Wadi Dif. The tributaries of\r\nWadi Feqoh are of much more interest than Wadi Feqoh itself, as they\r\ncontain in many places a fair or even relatively rich assemblage of\r\ntrees and bushes, and at least one good well, Bir Sararat Seyet.\r\n\r\nThe most southern tributaries of Wadi Feqoh which have been mapped\r\nare =Wadi Kamoyib=, draining eastward from Gebel Wadhait, and =Wadi\r\nTawayib=, draining the east face of Gebel Korabkansi. These are for\r\nthe most part barren wadis each coursing for about sixteen kilometres\r\nacross a sandy plain to join Feqoh.\r\n\r\nThe main head of Wadi Gimal is called =Wadi Seyet=. It originates\r\nbetween Gebel Wadhait and Gebel Dreb about latitude 22° 35′,\r\nand by means of many feeders drains the east face of Gebels Dreb\r\nand Gerf. The principal feeder of Wadi Seyet from the south-west is\r\n=Wadi Wadhait=, collecting the south drainage of Gebel Korabkansi,\r\nwhile on the east the =Wadi Sherefa el Gharbi=, which leads to the\r\nimportant Sherefa pass, contributes the drainage from the northern\r\nparts of Gebel Dreb and the south-west parts of Gebel Gerf. These\r\nboth join Wadi Seyet a little south of latitude 22° 40′, while\r\na little further down there enter from the east two small feeders\r\ncalled =Wadi Delawet= and =Wadi Buyet=. The name Seyet is given to\r\nthis wadi only down to where it passes through a narrow gap between\r\nhigh hills in latitude 22° 42′; below that point it is called\r\nWadi Gemal. Wadi Seyet is remarkably well wooded, containing an\r\nimmense number of fine large acacia trees, and presented an almost\r\npark-like appearance at the end of 1907. It also contains a deep\r\nwell, =Bir Sararat Seyet=, excavated in the wadi floor just above\r\nthe gap between the hills above referred to. This well was full\r\nof downwash in the winter of 1907. It is said to be twenty metres\r\ndeep and to yield plenty of good water, but at that time there was\r\nplenty of water in galts in the mountains, and the Arabs said they\r\npreferred to derive their supplies from these so long as they lasted,\r\nonly digging out the well when further supplies were necessary.[99]\r\nAn unnamed feeder from the west, joining Wadi Seyet just below the\r\nwell, leads by an easy pass into the head of =Wadi Hushenab=, which\r\ndrains through Wadi Sortdau into the Wadi Gemal lower down its course.\r\n\r\nThe country between Gebel Korabkansi and Gebel Niqrub Foqani,\r\nthrough which the course of Wadi Gemal lies, is a gently sloping\r\nplain with mere low banks, among which the drainage lines branch out\r\nforming numerous loops. The main channel runs fairly straight in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction, receiving =Wadis Sortdau= and =Remalib=,\r\ndraining the hills north-west of Gebel Korabkansi as tributaries on\r\nits west side; but a sort of loop line runs off eastward and reaches\r\nthe main channel again by the =Wadi Haletiai=, which also collects\r\nthe drainage from the south parts of Gebel Niqrub Foqani. After\r\npassing west of this last-named mountain, Wadi Gemal takes a more\r\nnortherly course; it receives an immense number of feeders from\r\nthe west and north of Gebel Niqrub Foqani, of which the principal\r\nis called =Wadi Umeiatib=. Other feeders enter from among the low\r\nhills on the west, the principal being =Wadi Hadelshisheib=, coming\r\nfrom the neighbourhood of the dark cone called Gebel Mismih. From\r\nBir Sararat Seyet to its junction with Wadi Feqoh the length of the\r\nmain channel of Wadi Gemal is fifty-seven kilometres, and its fall\r\nis from 560 metres above sea to about 310 metres, or on the average\r\nabout four and a half metres per kilometre; its slope is thus much\r\nmore rapid than that of Wadi Feqoh, though in its lower parts, where\r\nit passes over what is almost a plain, its gradient is less than\r\nhalf this average amount. The upper parts of the Wadi Gemal and its\r\ntributaries contain as a rule a fair abundance of trees and bushes.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Hashim=, which joins Wadi Feqoh about three kilometres\r\nabove Bir Dif, commences its course near Gebel Butitelib, where an\r\neasy pass, broad and sandy, 405 metres above sea-level, divides it\r\nfrom the heads of Rod Mukrayib, a tributary of Wadi Madi. Wadi Abu\r\nHashim follows a north-westerly course, nearly in a straight line,\r\ncollecting principally the drainage from the western slopes of\r\nthe range of high schist hills which flank the sandstone plateau of\r\nGebel Anfeib. It has a length of seventeen kilometres, and an average\r\nslope of about six metres per kilometre. It is a fairly open wadi,\r\nwithout much vegetation; on its west side are only very low hills.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Anfeib=, which enters Wadi Hodein from the south-west eight\r\nkilometres below the point of influx of Wadi Dif, is formed by the\r\nunion of three main heads, called =Wadi Anfeib el Tawayib=, =Wadi\r\nAtalab=, and =Wadi Mitatib=, draining respectively the northern,\r\ncentral, and southern parts of the great sandstone plateau of\r\nGebel Anfeib. Mitatib is joined half-way down its course by =Wadi\r\nUnfagalan=, which likewise heads in the plateau. Below the junction\r\nof its three main heads, Wadi Anfeib has a course of only about\r\nseven kilometres to run, through low hill country, before it joins\r\nWadi Hodein.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Madi=, the next great tributary of Wadi Hodein from the south,\r\nheads in the western side of the complex group of mountains called\r\nGebel Gerf, and courses in a northerly direction for over seventy\r\nkilometres before joining Wadi Hodein in longitude 35° 7′, five\r\nkilometres lower down Wadi Hodein than the mouth of Wadi Anfeib. The\r\nheads of Wadi Madi are extremely complex, consisting of a multitude\r\nof branching drainage lines, and some of them divide their drainage\r\nwith the Wadi Gemal, which enters Wadi Hodein by way of Wadis Feqoh\r\nand Dif. The most southerly head is the =Wadi Difoteb=, draining from\r\nthe west side of Gebel Gerf in latitude 22° 39′; but only a part\r\nof the drainage from this gets into Wadi Madi, the rest going into\r\nWadi Sherefa el Gharbi. A similar fate is shared by =Wadi Eirahimib=,\r\nwhich heads in a slightly difficult pass, leading into Wadi Um Reddam,\r\nabout three kilometres west of the highest point of Gebel Gerf in\r\nlatitude 22° 42′; this wadi courses in a direction a little south\r\nof west, falling very rapidly, past the hill mass of Gebel Tueiwi,\r\nwhere it divides, part of its drainage going northwards as Wadi\r\nMadi, and part crossing the plain as Wadi Buyet and joining the Wadi\r\nSeyet. The next head of Wadi Madi to the north is formed by =Wadi\r\nFaditiai=, which drains the high hills east of Gebel Tueiwi, and\r\ncaptures a part of the drainage brought down by the above-mentioned\r\nWadi Eirahimib. Exactly where the name Madi commences to be applied\r\nto the drainage is uncertain, as Arabs differ on the point, but it\r\nis probably most correct to consider Madi as commencing just south\r\nof Gebel Tueiwi, where the drainage of Wadi Eirahimib, with part\r\nof that from Wadi Difoteb, divides into two parts, the lesser going\r\ndown Wadi Buyet to join Wadi Seyet, while the greater forms Wadi Madi\r\nitself. On this basis, Wadi Faditiai is a tributary of Wadi Madi,\r\njoining it by several openings between latitudes 22° 44′ and 22°\r\n46′. There are numerous feeders from the low hill country both to\r\nWadi Faditiai and to Wadi Madi proper. After receiving Wadi Faditiai,\r\nMadi flows in a well-defined trench, with many trees, north-west\r\nfor a few kilometres to latitude 22° 47′, where it turns sharply,\r\nalmost at a right angle, to the north-east. A kilometre and a half\r\nbeyond the bend where there is a high granite hill on the west side\r\nof the wadi, is =Bir Madi=. This is a well sunk in the alluvium of\r\nthe wadi floor, having its mouth lined with stone slabs; in December\r\n1907, when I visited it, the water was four and a half metres deep,\r\nwith its surface three and a half metres below the wadi floor,\r\nand the water was good. The wadi floor here is 476 metres above\r\nsea-level. A beacon on the granite hill overlooking the well has\r\nthe position latitude 22° 47′ 46″ N., longitude 35° 1′\r\n38″ E., altitude 556 metres above sea. Below the well, Wadi Madi\r\nfollows a rather winding course among moderately high hills to a\r\nlittle north of latitude 22° 50′, where it gets into more open\r\ncountry and continues as a broad sandy valley, curving gently in a\r\nnortherly direction, to latitude 23° 5′. Beyond this point, where\r\nit receives the Rod Mukrayib and the Wadi Kolaiqo from the west and\r\neast respectively, Wadi Madi becomes narrower, and winds about, though\r\nstill keeping a general northerly direction, among low hill country\r\nto its junction with Wadi Hodein. Wadi Madi has many tributaries,\r\nthe chief being the Wadis Shellal el Gharbi, Tugudbaia, Sinatib,\r\nAtluk and Kolaiqo, and the Rod Mukrayib, which will be treated\r\nseparately further on. The upper parts of Wadi Madi and many of its\r\ntributaries are well stocked with trees, but its central parts,\r\nwhere it is wide and sandy, are more barren. Its principal head,\r\nthe Wadi Eirahimib, falls at an average rate of sixteen metres per\r\nkilometre; from near Gebel Tueiwi to Bir Madi the average slope is\r\nnine metres per kilometre; while in the final fifty-four kilometres\r\nof its course from Bir Madi to Wadi Hodein, the average gradient is\r\nrather less than six metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Shellal el Gharbi=, a tributary of Wadi Madi, originates in\r\nthe mountains about six kilometres north of the highest peak of\r\nGebel Gerf, where a pass connects it with Wadi Shellal el Sharqi,\r\na tributary of the eastward draining Wadi Radad. Flowing at first\r\nnearly due west, Wadi Shellal el Gharbi receives the =Wadi Um Reddam=,\r\nwhich collects the drainage from the north faces of the highest\r\npeaks of Gebel Gerf. Two of the heads of Um Reddam lead to passes;\r\none eastward to Wadi Shellal el Sharqi, and one westward into the\r\nhead of Wadi Eirahimib. Entering a lower hill country from which it\r\nreceives numerous feeders, Wadi Shellal el Gharbi turns north-west to\r\njoin Wadi Madi about eight kilometres below Bir Madi. It has a rather\r\nrapid fall, and contains a fair quantity of trees and bushes. Its\r\ntotal length along its main channel is twenty-one kilometres.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Sinatib=, which enters Wadi Madi about six kilometres below\r\nShellal el Gharbi, is a small wadi coursing north-west through the\r\nlow hill country north of Wadi Shellal.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Tugudbaia= conveys to Wadi Madi the drainage from the dyke\r\ncountry south-east of Gebel Niqrub el Foqani. It is only a short wadi,\r\nand enters Wadi Madi nearly opposite Sinatib.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Berendiyeb=, which joins Wadi Madi from the west about\r\nlatitude 22° 54′, drains the western flanks of Gebel Niqrub el\r\nFoqani. It is a many headed wadi, coursing at first among the low\r\nfoot-hills of the mountain, and then crossing almost a sandy plain\r\nto join Wadi Madi. Its length along its main channel is about twelve\r\nkilometres. North of Berendiyeb, there are two other feeders of Wadi\r\nMadi coming from the low hills north-east of Gebel Niqrub el Foqani;\r\nthey have no special names, being broad and sandy and without much\r\nvegetation in consequence of their draining only low country.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Atluk=, which flows into Wadi Madi from the south-east almost\r\nopposite Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani, has a rather curious origin. It\r\narises from a splitting of the course of Wadi Korbiai, part of the\r\ndrainage of which passes eastward down Wadi Kreiga, while the other\r\npart retains its northerly direction as Wadi Atluk. The total length\r\nof Wadi Atluk is about twenty-one kilometres. It has not been surveyed\r\nin detail, but for most of its course it lies in low hill country.\r\n\r\n=Rod Mukrayib= is a many-branched wadi which drains the hilly country\r\nbetween Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani and Gebel Anfeib. One of its heads\r\nleads by an easy pass near Gebel Butitelib into the head of Wadi\r\nAbu Hashim; another head drains the north face of Gebel Niqrub\r\nel Tahtani; while a third drains the south end of Gebel Anfeib,\r\ncoursing between the sandstone plateau and the schist hills west\r\nof it. From the pass into Wadi Abu Hashim to its junction with Wadi\r\nMadi the length of its channel is fifteen kilometres, with a fall of\r\nfrom 405 metres to 250 metres above sea, giving an average slope of\r\nten metres per kilometre. It joins Wadi Madi on the north side of an\r\nisolated group of hills, just where Wadi Madi begins to narrow in,\r\nabout nineteen kilometres above its junction with Wadi Hodein. From\r\nthe point where Rod Mukrayib joins Wadi Madi there is a good open\r\nroad across the heads of Wadi Edunqul into those of Wadi Anfeib.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Kolaiqo=, which joins Madi almost opposite Rod Mukrayib,\r\noriginates in the hills between Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani and Gebel\r\nKhashab, where a pass at its head leads into the heads of Wadi\r\nKhashab. It is a fairly wide wadi, shut in by rather high hills,\r\ncoursing west-north-west with a length of nine kilometres and a\r\nfairly rapid fall.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Edunqul=, a small tributary entering Wadi Madi, about ten\r\nkilometres above its junction with Wadi Hodein, drains by numerous\r\ngullies the south end of Gebel Anfeib, coursing a little north of\r\neast with a length of about eleven kilometres.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Khashab=, a tributary of Wadi Hodein, drains by many branches\r\nthe hilly country east of Gebel Beida. One of its heads leads to a\r\npass six kilometres due west of the summit of Gebel Beida, whence\r\nthere is a road to Bir Beida; just before reaching the pass, there\r\nis a large quartz vein with some ruins near it. Another feeder of\r\nWadi Khashab, the =Wadi Dehaiartib=, heads in a pass leading to the\r\nhead of Wadi Kolaiqo. Wadi Khashab has not been explored south of\r\n23° 0′. From this parallel to Wadi Hodein its length is about\r\ntwenty-six kilometres, but its head may be five kilometres or\r\nmore further south. The country on the west side of Wadi Khashab\r\nconsists of low hills, but on the east it drains very high hills,\r\nand its feeders course in trenches across the stony slopes at the\r\nfeet of the hills to join the main channel. Wadi Khashab contains\r\nlarge numbers of trees, whence its name (Khashab = wood). Its average\r\nslope is about eight metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Beida= originates at a pass 395 metres above sea-level, six\r\nkilometres west of the summit of Gebel Beida, where a road leads over\r\ninto Wadi Khashab. From the pass Beida courses south-east for seven\r\nkilometres, receiving feeders from the high hills on either side. It\r\nthen turns abruptly at an acute angle, following a northerly direction\r\nfor one and a half kilometres; then turning east for one kilometre,\r\nit receives a great feeder draining the south slopes of Wadi Beida,\r\nafterwards turning south for one and a half kilometres to a point\r\nmarked by the ruin of a small well built stone structure, in which\r\nmortar and stucco has been used. From this point the wadi follows\r\na winding course, at first south-east but gradually working round\r\ninto a north-easterly direction, as a narrow gorge through the high\r\nhills of Gebel Beida. Just where the wadi begins to turn northward,\r\nabout one and a half kilometres below the ruin above-mentioned, are\r\nthe two wells called =Bir Beida=. The upper well is at the opening\r\nof a defile leading south-eastward to a pass, forming the point\r\nof departure in the nearest road from Bir Beida to Bir Meneiga;\r\nthis well was dry in November 1907. The lower well is about 500\r\nmetres further down the wadi, at a sharp bend in its course; it is\r\nan excavation in the alluvium of the wadi floor, and was yielding\r\ngood water in 1907 from a depth of about six metres. The Arabs say\r\nthat the supply at this well only fails after three or four years\r\nwithout rainfall, but the water only infiltrates slowly, so that\r\nafter it has been emptied by a caravan it requires a day or so to\r\nrefill. The top of the well is 205 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\nAbout four kilometres below the well, Wadi Beida emerges from the high\r\nhills, and crosses a tract of much lower hill country seven kilometres\r\nwide, receiving in this part of its course many feeders from the\r\neastern face of Gebel Beida; it then divides, still preserving its\r\ngeneral north-easterly direction, into a number of shallow channels\r\ncoursing across the sandy plain to join the Wadi Hodein.\r\n\r\nFrom Bir Beida the nearest wells are Bir Meneiga and Bir Shalatein;\r\nthe water of the latter is, however, very salt and only drinkable\r\nby camels. To Bir Meneiga, a distance of thirty-seven kilometres,\r\nthe track leads over the pass already mentioned south-east of the\r\nupper (dry) well, thence into Wadi Kreiga, and up that wadi into Wadi\r\nMeneiga; the road is rather stony near Meneiga, and rises rapidly,\r\nso plenty of time should be allowed. To reach Bir Shalatein, forty\r\nkilometres distant, one descends Wadi Beida into Wadi Hodein and\r\nfollows Wadi Hodein towards the sea; the road is easy, being mostly\r\nacross a falling sandy plain.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Kreiga=, the last great tributary of Wadi Hodein, originates\r\nby the union of the Wadis Korbiai and Meneiga, both draining that\r\nnorth extension of the mountain mass of Gebel Gerf which is sometimes\r\ncalled Gebel Korbiai or Gebel Meneiga.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Korbiai= and =Wadi Meneiga= have their heads only separated by\r\na narrow mountain ridge, but there is no possible track over this\r\nridge from one to the other. In each case the wadi contains two\r\nwater sources near its head, and the limit of “navigability” of\r\nthe wadi is formed practically by these sources, above which there\r\nare steep stony gorges.\r\n\r\n=Bir Korbiai= consists of two wells, both situated at the foot of a\r\nsudden drop in the rocky bed of Wadi Korbiai, about 150 metres apart,\r\nsunk in the bouldery alluvium; there is some rude timbering at the\r\nmouth of the wells over which a large stone is placed to prevent\r\ninfilling by downwash. In December 1907 both wells contained abundance\r\nof excellent water, only a metre below ground level. Both wells are\r\neasily accessible, though the road to them is stony. The wells are\r\nstated to yield good supplies for three or four years after rain\r\nhas fallen, but after longer drought they only yield a little.\r\n\r\nBelow the wells, Wadi Korbiai sweeps round in a semicircle of about\r\nthree kilometres radius round the west flank of the hills to join\r\nWadi Meneiga. On its right side are the steep slopes of Gebel Korbiai,\r\nbut on the left is lower hill country. Small feeders enter from both\r\nsides. The bed of the wadi is stony, but there are a fair number\r\nof trees in it. Only a part of the drainage of Wadi Korbiai turns\r\neastward to join Wadi Meneiga in forming Wadi Kreiga; the other\r\npart pursues a northerly course into the Wadi Atluk, a tributary of\r\nWadi Madi.\r\n\r\n=Bir Meneiga= is important, not only as giving a perennial supply\r\nof good water, but also as marking a point on the administrative\r\nfrontier of Egypt and the Sudan. It consists of two springs in the\r\nstony bed of Wadi Meneiga, near its head. The northern spring is\r\ntaken as marking the frontier; its position is latitude 22° 47′\r\n8″ N. longitude 35° 12′ 20″ E., altitude 605 metres above\r\nsea-level. The southern spring is about 320 metres further up the\r\nwadi, at a level four or five metres higher. Each of the springs\r\nconsists of a tiny pool among the rocks of the wadi floor, easily\r\naccessible to camels. The pools only contain eight or ten gallons\r\neach, but camels can drink as fast as they like and the pool keeps\r\nfull. The water is excellent. There are numerous ruins at Bir Meneiga;\r\nthey consist of rude rubble hovels and extend for over a kilometre\r\ndown the wadi below the springs.\r\n\r\nAbove the springs, Wadi Meneiga soon becomes impassable, ending\r\nin rocky gorges in the mountains. Below the springs it courses for\r\nabout seven kilometres in a direction a little west of north to join\r\nWadi Korbiai and form the head of Wadi Kreiga. The fall in this seven\r\nkilometres is 200 metres, so that the slope is the phenomenally rapid\r\none of twenty-eight metres per kilometre, and of course the floor\r\nof the wadi is very stony and camel progress is very slow. There\r\nare several lateral feeders, including one from the east, three\r\nkilometres below the springs, leading to the head of Wadi Radad;\r\nbut I am not sure whether the pass is practicable as I only saw it\r\nfrom the mountain top.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of Wadi Meneiga, Wadi Kreiga courses about 15° north\r\nof east, as a fairly wide wadi with a stony floor, with high hills on\r\neither side from which small feeders enter. The first large feeder,\r\nthe =Wadi Abiad=, enters from the north-west, six kilometres below\r\nthe mouth of Wadi Meneiga; it is a steeply falling wadi, which, like\r\nall wadis bearing the name of Abiad, has a floor of light-coloured\r\ngranitic sand. Some eight kilometres lower down, two feeders enter\r\nfrom opposite sides: that from the north is called =Wadi Eberer=,\r\nwhile that from the south bears the name of =Wadi Shigeg=. Neither of\r\nthese has been followed up far, and their length is unknown; but they\r\nare believed to be of no great extent. Below this point the country\r\nopens out considerably, and the wadi anastomoses round low hills,\r\nwhile its floor becomes less stony and more easy under foot. The\r\nvarious channels unite again about eight kilometres further down,\r\nwhere the wadi receives a tributary from the north-west just before it\r\npasses the high hill mass which forms the southward extension of Gebel\r\nBeida. This tributary leads to an easy pass, forming a direct road to\r\nBir Beida. Lower down several lateral feeders come into Kreiga from\r\neither side, and the wadi emerges on to a sandy plain with scattered\r\nlow hills. Across this plain Kreiga takes a more northerly direction\r\nfor about sixteen kilometres to join the Wadi Hodein. The length of\r\nWadi Kreiga from the mouth of Wadi Meneiga to Wadi Hodein is about\r\nfourty-one kilometres. Its fall between these points is from 405\r\nmetres to about 70 metres above sea-level, giving an average slope\r\nof eight metres per kilometre; the slope in the upper parts, where\r\nthe wadi bed is stony, is of course somewhat greater, and that in\r\nits lower more sandy reaches is somewhat less than this average.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Kolaiqo= is a very ill-defined drainage line heading in the\r\nlow hills called Gebel Kolaiqo, and coursing north-east for about\r\nthirty kilometres across the sandy coast-plain to reach the sea\r\nabout latitude 23° 0′. It is very sandy, and absolutely barren\r\nexcept for a little scrub in its upper parts. It would hardly have\r\nbeen noticed had not the triangulation station on the hill at its\r\nhead been occupied.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Shab=, with a basin of about 1,250 square kilometres, drains\r\nthe eastern and southern portions of the great group of mountains of\r\nwhich Gebel Gerf is the centre, and reaches the sea in latitude 22°\r\n52′, a little to the north of Mersa Shab. It has a great number of\r\nheads, most of which bear special names, the name Shab being applied\r\ncollectively to them from the locality near the hill of Qrein Salama,\r\nabout forty kilometres from the sea, where they begin to unite\r\ntogether into one great trunk channel. From the circumstance that\r\nits heads are situated in a high mountain mass where the rainfall\r\nis relatively great, and moreover have steeply falling stony beds\r\nwhich absorb but little of the precipitation, the upper portions\r\nof Shab and its feeders are well stocked with trees. Only in the\r\nlast stages of its course to the sea, where the absorption of its\r\ndrainage by the sandy coast plain becomes great, does the abundance\r\nof vegetation fall off and the channel become barren. Its principal\r\nheads and feeders are Wadi Radad (fed by Wadi Shellal el Sharqi),\r\nWadi Tikosha, Wadi Muqur (fed by Wadi Ti Ilak), Wadi Qadiloi (fed by\r\nTilat Tihu Shana), Wadi Baaneit, Wadi Kilanai, Wadi Um Saha, Wadi\r\nDiqdib, Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi, and Kwat Hewah. At least three of\r\nthese contain good water sources, Bir Muqur, Bir Baaneit, and Bir\r\nDiqdib being situated in the upper parts of the wadis bearing the\r\nsame names. The various heads and feeders of Shab will be described\r\nin detail below, commencing from the northernmost one.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Radad= may be more properly described as a tributary than as\r\none of the heads of Wadi Shab, as it joins the trunk wadi some fifteen\r\nkilometres below the other feeders. It originates in a rugged tract of\r\nhigh hills near Bir Meneiga, and courses eastward for about thirty-six\r\nkilometres, joining Wadi Shab on the coast-plain near the low hills\r\nof Ti Qireira, about twenty-four kilometres up from the point where\r\nWadi Shab enters the sea. It has not been surveyed in detail, but\r\nits course was mapped from the triangulation station of Gebel Gerf\r\nand from other occupied stations whence portions of it were visible.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Shellal el Sharqi=, a large feeder of Wadi Radad, originates\r\nin the mountains between Bir Diqdib and Bir Muqur. It has many heads,\r\nthe best known of which is one coming from the west, leading to a pass\r\ninto Wadi Shellal el Gharbi, a tributary of Wadi Madi; while another,\r\na little further south, leads to another pass into Wadi Um Reddam and\r\nforms a possible road to Bir Sararat Seyet. Wadi Shellal el Sharqi\r\nfollows generally a northward course, with a rapid fall, and joins\r\nWadi Radad about eighteen kilometres below the head of the latter.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Muqur= heads in the eastern mountains of the Gerf group, which\r\nare sometimes called Gebel Muqur. Here the drainage from several\r\nsteeply falling rocky gullies collects into a single winding gorge\r\nshut in by the mountains. The limit to which camels can go up the\r\ngorge is marked by a well called =Bir Muqur=. At the time of my\r\nvisit to this, in February 1908, the well was filled up by debris,\r\nthrough which, however, the water constantly rose and trickled\r\ninto pools in a series of rock basins at slightly lower levels. The\r\nflow was at the rate of about five litres per minute, the overflow\r\nfrom the basins running to waste at this rate in the sand of the\r\nwadi. The water was of excellent quality. The Arabs state that\r\nwhen the water ceases to flow as a spring they dig out the debris\r\nand use the place as a well. Below the well, Wadi Muqur pursues a\r\nwinding course north-eastward for about two and a half kilometres;\r\nthen, receiving the short =Wadi Ti Ilak=, draining the mountains\r\nto the west, it turns sharply eastward and emerges from the high\r\nhills into lower country about three kilometres further on. In the\r\nlower country the wadi changes its direction to east-north-east,\r\nreceiving many feeders from among the low hills west of Qrein Salama,\r\nand its bed divides and anastomoses into a series of channels, which\r\neventually unite just before it enters Wadi Shab, five kilometres\r\nnorth-east of Qrein Salama. From near its head at Bir Muqur to its\r\njunction with Shab, Wadi Muqur has a length along its main channel of\r\nabout nineteen kilometres; it falls from 470 metres above sea-level\r\nat the well to 200 metres at its junction with Shab, so that the\r\naverage gradient is about fourteen metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\nA few kilometres before reaching Wadi Shab, Wadi Muqur is joined\r\nby the =Wadi Tikosha=, draining the moderately high hills which lie\r\nbetween Wadi Radad and Gebel Muqur, and winding among low hills over\r\nthe plain.\r\n\r\nThe =Wadis Qadiloi= and =Baaneit= drain from the east faces of Gebel\r\nMuqur and the mountains and hills close south and east of it, into\r\nWadi Shab. There is an eastward extension of hills from Gebel Muqur,\r\npartly drained by =Tilat Tihu Shana=, which flows into Wadi Qadiloi;\r\nsouth of this extension there is a sort of bay, occupied by lower\r\nhills separating Wadi Qadiloi from Wadi Baaneit, through which several\r\ncross channels connect the two wadis. =Bir Baaneit= is a small well\r\nin Wadi Baaneit, near its head; it is said to yield water always,\r\nbut refills slowly, so that only six to ten camels can be watered\r\nat once. A little below the well, Wadi Baaneit leaves the hills\r\nand courses north-east across a rapidly falling stony plain. On the\r\nplain, south of the main channel, are the two ruins called =Darahib\r\nBaaneit=. They are built of rubble stone set in plaster, with stucco\r\nfacing in places, and appear to be ancient Moslem tombs, the larger\r\none having evidently once supported a dome; there are about twenty\r\nArab graves near the ruins.\r\n\r\nSouth of Wadi Baaneit the plain is crossed by many drainage channels\r\ncoursing north-east to join Wadi Shab, and the plain is covered here\r\nwith quite a park-like growth of acacia trees. The principal channel,\r\nwhich comes from the hills about four kilometres south Bir Baaneit,\r\nis called =Wadi Kilanai=.\r\n\r\nA little south of Wadi Kilanai the plain cuts far back to the west,\r\nand the drainage entering this portion comes from the heart of the\r\nGerf mountains to the north-west. A large isolated granite hill-mass\r\ncalled Kilia Arib and numerous smaller hills break the monotony\r\nof the plain and cause much branching and looping of the drainage\r\nchannels. The principal artery draining the south parts of Gebel\r\nGerf is the =Wadi Diqdib=, which originates on the south flanks of\r\nthe highest peaks, right in the heart of the mountain mass. In one\r\nof the heads is a well called =Bir Diqdib=, which, though of great\r\nservice to the Koatil Arabs who inhabit this district with their\r\ncamels and other animals, is of little importance to the traveller\r\nbecause of its situation in a closed-in wadi and thus not being on any\r\nroute. From its head, Wadi Diqdib courses south-westward for fifteen\r\nkilometres or more among the mountains, receiving many feeders, before\r\nit emerges on to the plain. On leaving the mountains it splits up,\r\npart of its drainage going round by the north side of Kilia Arib, and\r\npart by the south, in each case by a number of anastomosing channels.\r\n\r\nThe =Wadi Um Saha= drains the hills south-west of Bir Baaneit, and\r\nafter coursing southwards among the mountains turns the corner and\r\nruns north-east across the plain to Wadi Shab.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi=, which drains the south portion of the\r\nGerf _massif_ and the north-east flanks of Gebel Dreb, heads in the\r\nimportant Sherefa pass, 807 metres above sea-level, and forming the\r\ndirect route from Gebel Hamra Dom and Gebel Um Rasein to Bir Sararat\r\nSeyet by way of Wadi Sherefa el Gharbi. The pass is a fairly easy\r\none, though the fall is rapid, especially on the east side, where\r\nWadi Sherefa el Sharqi falls no less than one hundred metres in\r\nthe first two kilometres of its course. A feeder which enters Wadi\r\nSherefa el Sharqi from the south about two kilometres below the pass\r\nis said to lead by another pass to a well called =Bir Bint el Dreb=,\r\nsituated at the head of =Wadi Dreb=, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh. For\r\nthe first seven kilometres of its east-south-easterly course below\r\nthe pass, Sherefa el Sharqi is shut in by very high hills, from\r\nwhich numerous feeders join it; it then divides just before reaching\r\nthe great white granite hills called Eir Arib, part of its drainage\r\ngoing southward to join Kwat Hewah, and part continuing its course on\r\nthe north side of the granite hills to join Diqdib near the granite\r\ncones of Tibashoi and thence turning northwards over a large sandy\r\nplain to enter Wadi Shab.\r\n\r\n=Kwat Hewah= drains the eastern flanks of Gebel Dreb and the north\r\nflanks of G. Medarai. Its heads unite to form a series of channels\r\nin a small plain south-west of Eir Arib, and here it receives a\r\ncontribution from Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi as mentioned above. As it\r\npasses Eir Arib, Kwat Hewah divides, part of its drainage curving\r\nround to the north to join that of Wadi Diqdib and Wadi Sherefa el\r\nSharqi on its way to Wadi Shab, and the remainder going south-west\r\nto join the Wadi Medarai. From the head of Kwat Hewah there is said\r\nto be an easy pass into the Wadi el Krim, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Ibib=, which drains the eastern slopes of Gebels Medarai,\r\nAbu Hireiq, and Abu Hodeid, and the eastern and northern faces of\r\nGebels Soaorib, Adar Qaqa, Leqaq, Um Seleim, Qidmib, Orgem, and Um\r\nBishtit, as well as Gebel Hamra Dom and the smaller hills south of\r\nit, is formed by the union of the Wadis Hasium and Medarai, a little\r\neast of Gebel Um Rasein, and enters the sea at Mersa Shab. It has\r\na drainage basin of about 1,800 square kilometres. Including Wadi\r\nHasium, which is simply the upper portion of Ibib, its total length\r\nalong its main channel is slightly over one hundred kilometres. Its\r\nprincipal tributaries are the Wadis Shinai, Abu Hodeid, Abu Hireiq,\r\nMedarai, Soaorib, and Um Bishtit.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Hasium=, which forms the upper portion of Wadi Ibib, originates\r\non the main watershed in about latitude 22° 10′ and longitude\r\n35° 15′; a pass leads from its head on to a stony plain, whence\r\na track leads to Miti Kwan, a tributary of Wadi Alaqi. Near its\r\nhead, Wadi Hasium contains a small well called =Bir Kagog=. A few\r\nkilometres further down, the short =Wadi Mantil Hasium=, draining\r\nthe western face of Gebel Adar Qaqa, enters from the east, while\r\nthe =Wadi Hilwit Hasium=, draining the mountain of the same name\r\nand containing a galt near its head, joins Wadi Hasium from the\r\nwest. Continuing its course northward past the mountains of Adar\r\nQaqa and Leqaq, Wadi Hasium enters an extensive sandy plain, open\r\nto the north, bounded on the west by the mountains of Abu Hodeid\r\nand Um Rasein, on the south by those of Leqaq and Um Seleim, and on\r\nthe east by those of Qidmib and Orgem. This plain, which averages\r\nfifteen kilometres in width, is broken by low hills, the principal\r\nof which, Gebel Hamra Tit, Kulet Meiqrum, and Kulet Tinasal, rise\r\nto considerable heights. Hasium courses slightly east of north near\r\nthe western edge of this plain to near Gebel Um Rasein, then curves\r\nto the east across it, receiving the Wadi Medarai and becoming Wadi\r\nIbib. In its northward course through the plain, Wadi Hasium receives\r\na number of important tributaries from the western mountains, besides\r\na few smaller feeders from the mountains to the south and from the\r\nhills on the plain. These may be briefly described in order.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Shinai=, draining the hills south of Gebel Abu Hodeid, courses\r\na little south of east and enters Wadi Hasium about latitude 22°\r\n19′; it has not been surveyed in detail, but it contains a well\r\nknown water source, =Bir Shinai=, which is said to be about seven\r\nkilometres from its junction with Hasium.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Delawet=, another small feeder which likewise drains the hills\r\nsouth of Abu Hodeid, and enters Wadi Hasium about three kilometres\r\nbelow Wadi Shinai, is of importance as leading to a camel track over\r\nhills which forms the means of access to =Bir Odis Maaleq=, I have not\r\nvisited this water source, but it is said to yield immense quantities\r\nof good water, and to be situated at a rather high level in the head\r\nof a small wadi called =Wadi Odis=, a tributary of Abu Hodeid. It\r\nappears to be a spring fed by the rainfall on the surrounding high\r\nmountains, the overflow filling large rock basins. The reason why it\r\nis approached by the Wadi Delawet and the track over the mountains,\r\ninstead of by ascending Wadi Abu Hodeid and the Wadi Odis directly,\r\nis that the latter route is very difficult for camels owing to the\r\nsteep and stony nature of the wadi floor; it is, however, possible\r\nto use this route on foot. As nearly as I could make out from my\r\nguides’ statements, the total distance of Bir Odis Maaleq from the\r\nmouth of Wadi Delawet is about nine kilometres, of which the first\r\nfour are in the Wadi Delawet and the remaining five on the hill\r\ntrack. The distance by the other route from Bir Abu Hodeid is about\r\nfour kilometres, some of which is climbing. My native assistant,\r\nwho was sent to erect the beacon on Gebel Abu Hodeid, took two and\r\na half hours to go on foot from Bir Abu Hodeid to Bir Odis Maaleq,\r\nand estimated the latter spring to be some 150 metres higher than\r\nBir Abu Hodeid.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Hodeid=, which drains the mountain mass of the same name,\r\nlies to the east of the highest peaks of Gebel Abu Hodeid and is shut\r\nin between them and another high range further east. It has a general\r\nsouth-south-easterly direction, and a very rapid fall. Its principal\r\nfeeder is the short Wadi Odis above referred to, which falls into\r\nit from the west about six kilometres below its head. About one and\r\na half kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi Odis, there is\r\na large and important spring of good water in the wadi, called =Bir\r\nAbu Hodeid=. Though I have not visited this spring, its situation is\r\nshown on the map with tolerable accuracy, as its position with regard\r\nto neighbouring triangulated points was indicated by the guides. My\r\nnative assistant, who passed the spring on his way to erect the beacon\r\non Gebel Abu Hodeid, reported it to be very similar to the springs\r\nof Abu Saafa in appearance, though the latter are in a different\r\nrock. From its position in the midst of high mountains, Wadi Abu\r\nHodeid must at times of rainfall collect a great deal of water, and\r\nthis explains the constant supplies yielded by the spring. Above the\r\nspring, the steepness of the wadi renders its ascent very difficult\r\nfor loaded camels, and there is no road through its head, but guides\r\nstate that there is good grazing at certain seasons in its upper\r\nparts, and animals are taken there to feed. Below the spring, the\r\nwadi opens out and curves eastward round the foot of the remarkable\r\nrounded peak of Abu Hodeid Oqla to join Wadi Hasium on the plain.\r\n\r\nThe =Rod Anut Berer=, which joins Wadi Hasium about the same point\r\nas Wadi Abu Hodeid but from the opposite side, drains the mountains\r\nof Leqaq and Um Seleim which bound the plain to the south.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Tikraneib=, a small wadi full of trees, drains a jagged range\r\nnorth of Abu Hodeid Oqla, and joins Wadi Hasium on the plain by\r\nseveral channels.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Abu Hireiq=, draining the mountains of the same name, originates\r\nabout latitude 22° 27′. On leaving the high mountains its channel\r\ndivides, part of the drainage going north-east as Wadi Merdiyeb,\r\nand part south-east as Wadi Abu Hireiq. This latter wadi passes\r\nbetween the main mountains and a high isolated range of hills for\r\nabout seven kilometres, then curves round to the eastward to join\r\nWadi Hasium. There are numerous loopings and branchings of the wadis\r\nin this neighbourhood, caused by the feeders from the hills and\r\nby the presence of isolated hill masses, which the drainage lines\r\nfrequently encircle, and it becomes impossible to say which of the\r\nvarious channels is the main wadi, so that the name Wadi Abu Hireiq\r\nis applied to all of them collectively.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Odruk= is a small wadi draining between two groups of high\r\nhills south-west of Gebel Um Rasein; it joins one of the channels of\r\nWadi Abu Hireiq about four kilometres above its junction with Hasium.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Nilateib=, another small wadi further north, drains the\r\nsouth end of Gebel Um Rasein and the north-east faces of the hills\r\nclose south-west of it. Coursing at first south-east for about three\r\nkilometres, it then curves round the foot of Gebel Um Rasein to join\r\nWadi Hasium by two channels. There is a clear passage from the heads\r\nof both Wadi Odruk and Wadi Nilateib into Wadi Merdiyeb. All the wadis\r\nhereabouts contain plenty of trees and scrub, especially in their\r\nupper parts; as Wadi Hasium is approached they become more sandy\r\nand barren. It is, of course, the presence of vegetation available\r\nfor grazing which determines the possession of a name by such small\r\nwadis as these two.\r\n\r\nThe drainage from the east face of Gebel Um Rasein joins Wadi\r\nHasium directly by many small channels, which appear not to bear\r\nany special name.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Medarai=, which forms the Wadi Ibib by its junction with Hasium,\r\nten kilometres due east of Gebel Um Rasein, has its main head in Gebel\r\nMedarai, its length along its main channel being about twenty-five\r\nkilometres. By numerous tributaries, many of which contain abundance\r\nof trees and scrub, it drains the whole of the high hill country\r\nbetween Gebel Medarai and Gebel Um Rasein, and it also takes a part\r\nof the drainage from Kwat Hewah. One of its heads is said to lead\r\nto a rather difficult pass, south of Gebel Medarai, into the =Wadi\r\nKirwau=, a tributary of Feqoh. For the first ten kilometres or so\r\nof its length, Wadi Medarai courses a little north of east; it then\r\nreceives the feeder from Kwat Hewah above referred to, and changes\r\nits direction to a little south of east, passing close north of Gebel\r\nUm Rasein on its way to join Wadi Hasium on the sandy plain of the\r\nnumerous feeders of Wadi Medarai from the hills west and north of\r\nUm Rasein, the principal is =Wadi Merdiyeb=, which originates ten\r\nkilometres south-west of Gebel Um Rasein by the splitting of Wadi\r\nAbu Hireiq. From this point of origin, it runs in a north-easterly\r\ndirection in a rather sinuous course among the hills for about twelve\r\nor thirteen kilometres, joining Wadi Medarai close north of Gebel Um\r\nRasein. Another little feeder of Wadi Medarai, though only about two\r\nkilometres long, is of some importance from its leading to =Bir Um\r\nRasein=, a small well among the north foot-hills of Gebel Um Rasein.\r\n\r\nVegetation ceases to be abundant both in Wadi Medarai and in Wadi\r\nHasium before their junction to form Wadi Ibib, and Wadi Ibib itself\r\nis for the most part a barren sandy ill-defined channel coursing\r\nnorth-eastward across a dreary plain for some fifty-seven kilometres\r\nto Mersa Shab. In this fifty-seven kilometres its fall is very nearly\r\n300 metres, giving an average slope of only a little over five metres\r\nper kilometre. The slope of the lower part of Wadi Hasium is rather\r\nsteeper than this, while that of Wadi Medarai is about twice as great.\r\n\r\nBut though Wadi Ibib itself is barren, it has some great tributaries\r\nwhich contains abundance of trees and scrub in their upper reaches,\r\nas well as several wells. The principal of these tributaries are\r\nthe Wadis Soaorib and Um Bishtit, which with their feeders drain\r\nthe mountains of Soaorib, Qidmib, Orgem, and Um Bishtit, while other\r\nsmaller tributaries drain the lower hills north-east of Um Bishtit\r\nand Gebel Hamra Dom.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Soaorib= originates in the midst of high mountains a little\r\nsouth of latitude 22° 10′, between the southern portion of Gebel\r\nSoaorib and the range which extends southwards from Hadal Aweib\r\nMeisah. At its head is a difficult pass westward into the head\r\nof Miti Kwan, a tributary of Alaqi. Curving at first eastward,\r\nit soon takes on a north-westerly direction, and in latitude 22°\r\n11′ 30″ reaches a small open space called =Mitba=; here it is\r\nmet by several tributary wadis of which the principal is the =Wadi\r\nHaiyo=, draining the eastern slopes of Gebel Soaorib. From Mitba\r\nthe direction of Wadi Soaorib becomes more northerly, and about\r\nnine kilometres below Mitba it turns to the west, emerging from\r\nthe mountains into the more open country which forms the south\r\nend of the great plain already referred to. Here it is joined by\r\nthe =Wadi Hankuk=, draining north-eastward from Gebel Adar Qaqa,\r\nand a few kilometres further on by the =Wadi Dishlo=, which drains\r\nthe western flanks of Hadal Aweib Meisah and enters Soaorib from\r\nthe east. About three kilometres below the point of influx of\r\nWadi Dishlo, Wadi Soaorib is joined from the south-west by another\r\ntributary which drains the west side of Gebel Um Seleim. From this\r\npoint onwards, Wadi Soaorib courses a little east of north in a\r\nnot very well defined course for about twenty-two kilometres over\r\na gently falling sandy plain, joining Ibib to the north-west of the\r\nsand-swathed hills called Baqari Daba. In this part of its course,\r\nWadi Soaorib receives small feeders from among the hills west of it\r\non the plain, the principal of them draining north-eastward between\r\nthe hills called Kulet Meiqrum and Kulet Tinasal. It also receives\r\nmore important tributaries from the mountains to the east of it,\r\nthe principal of these being the Wadis Eimya and Qidmib. =Wadi Eimya=\r\ndrains the western face of Gebel Qidmib, while =Wadi Qidmib= drains\r\nthe northern parts of the same mountain. Wadi Qidmib has two main\r\nheads; the western one lies between two high mountain ridges, and\r\ncontains a well called =Bir Qidmib=, while the eastern one leads to\r\na steep pass by which Wadi Meisah can be reached. Before reaching\r\nWadi Soaorib, Wadi Qidmib is joined by other feeders draining the\r\nwestern flanks of Gebel Orgem and Baqari Daba.\r\n\r\nFrom its head at the pass into Miti Kwan to its junction with Ibib,\r\nWadi Soaorib has a length of about fifty kilometres. The level of\r\nthe pass is unknown, but from Mitba to Ibib the level of the wadi\r\nfloor falls from 505 metres above sea to 260 metres in a length of\r\nabout forty-one kilometres, giving an average slope of six metres\r\nper kilometre. Most of the upper portions of Wadi Soaorib and its\r\ntributaries are well stocked with trees and bushes, but as the wadi\r\ncrosses the sandy plain it becomes more and more barren. The place\r\nwhere it enters on the plain in latitude 22° 20′ marks a tribal\r\nboundary, the upper parts, including Wadi Dishlo, belonging to the\r\nBalgab Arabs, while the lower parts, including Wadis Eimya and Qidmib,\r\nare Kurbeilab territory.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Um Bishtit=, which joins Wadi Ibib some five kilometres lower\r\ndown its course than does Wadi Soaorib, heads in a small open space\r\nin latitude 22° 26′ and longitude 35° 35′. At its head there are\r\ntwo easy passes, one leading northward into the head of Wadi Habliai,\r\nanother tributary of Wadi Ibib, and the other southward into the\r\nheads of Wadi Meisah. Just below its head Wadi Um Bishtit is joined\r\nby the small =Wadi Delawet=, draining the hills close to the south;\r\nwhile a little lower down is another small tributary from a rocky\r\ngorge among the south hills, which is important as leading to =Bir\r\nUm Bishtit=. This well, which was filled by downwash when I visited\r\nit in March 1908, is situated in the floor of the gorge at a sharp\r\nbend, about a kilometre up from the main wadi. According to the\r\nguides, it requires excavating about five metres deep, and yields\r\nwater in quantity for about a year after rain, but when there has\r\nbeen no rain for a year only small supplies can be got, as it fills\r\nslowly; at the time of my visit there was no necessity to open the\r\nwell because there was plenty of water in galts in the mountains of\r\nMeis-heit-ar, a little further south. The well is easy of access,\r\nand lies at 330 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe total length of Wadi Um Bishtit is about fourteen kilometres. In\r\nthe first half of its course it runs north-westward, shut in by\r\nhigh hills, and contains abundance of small trees. After cutting\r\nthrough the hills it receives the Wadi Orgem from the south, and\r\nturns northward in opening country to join Wadi Ibib north of the\r\nhills called Adar Aweib Um Bishtit. Its average slope is about nine\r\nmetres per kilometre.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Orgem=, which joins Wadi Um Bishtit about four kilometres\r\nbelow the gorge containing the well, has its head at an easy pass\r\nnear the remarkable peak of O Shakafa; this pass leads into Wadi\r\nMeisah, about three kilometres above Bir Meisah. From the pass,\r\nthe Wadi Orgem runs between the high hill ranges of Orgem and Um\r\nBishtit, in a direction a little west of north, for about sixteen\r\nkilometres to its junction with Wadi Um Bishtit.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Habliai=, which heads in an easy pass about three kilometres\r\neast of Bir Um Bishtit, and runs northwards for about ten kilometres\r\nto join Wadi Ibib, is a broad sandy and rather barren wadi draining\r\ngneiss hills; the hills on the east are much lower than those on\r\nthe west, and their feet are swathed in drift sand.\r\n\r\nThe last feeders of Wadi Ibib are those draining from the isolated\r\nrange of high granite hills called Gebel Hamra Dom. These feeders\r\nare very numerous, some coming from the west side of the hills and\r\ncurving round its south end to join Wadi Ibib, while others from the\r\neast side course east and north-east over the plain directly into Wadi\r\nIbib. They contain numerous small trees near their heads, and after\r\nrain there springs up short grass in this locality, affording for\r\nshort periods grazing for great flocks of sheep. The most northerly\r\ndrainage channel from the east side heads in the hills a little north\r\nof the highest peaks, and here, after rain has fallen recently,\r\nshallow wells are dug in the sand and yield good water. The place\r\nwhere the wells are is called =Ti Dabei Hamra Dom=. One cannot rely\r\non getting water there for long after rain has fallen, as the supplies\r\nare soon exhausted. In January 1908, I heard that water and grass were\r\nextremely abundant, and large numbers of Arabs were encamped there\r\nwith their flocks and herds. But when I reached the place at the end\r\nof the next month, most of the grass had been eaten up; only a few\r\nArabs remained, and these were baling out the last drops of water\r\nfrom the holes to fill their skins preparatory to forsaking the place.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Meisah=, which drains the north and east slopes of Hadal\r\nAweib Meisah, the eastern slopes of Gebel Qidmib, and the mountains\r\nof Meis-heit-ar, besides the lower hills of Titailibab, Tahaqayet,\r\nand Eqrun, has a total length along its main channel (including Wadi\r\nAwitla, the central one of its three main heads) of about seventy-five\r\nkilometres, and enters the sea about latitude 22° 45′.\r\n\r\nWadi Meisah has three main heads, called by separate names. The most\r\nnortherly is the =Wadi Sarobaiya=, draining from between Gebels Qidmib\r\nand Meis-heit-ar; one of the heads of this leads to a steep pass into\r\nWadi Qidmib. The central head, =Wadi Awitla=, drains the north slopes\r\nof Hadal Aweib Meisah. The southern head, the =Wadi Lasewid=, drains\r\nthe eastern slopes of Hadal Aweib Meisah and the lower hills to the\r\neast of it; by ascending its southern feeders, one can pass easily\r\ninto the heads of Wadi Baueiwai, while one of the gullies opening\r\ninto it from Hadal Aweib Meisah contains a series of rock basins and\r\na small spring called =Megwel Um Edwa=, rather difficult of access\r\nfor camels, which was yielding fair supplies of water in April 1908.\r\n\r\nThese three heads, each of which has numerous feeders, join together\r\nin a small plain at the south-east foot of O Shakafa, a remarkably\r\nprominent peak practically isolated from the mountains near it,\r\nand from this point onwards the main drainage channel is called\r\nWadi Meisah. The little plain where the three head wadis unite is\r\ncovered with trees, and has almost the aspect of a park; it is 455\r\nmetres above sea-level. Curving eastward and northward close round\r\nthe foot of O Shakafa, Wadi Meisah receives from the south the\r\n=Sarob Kwan=, a short and very broad wadi leading to an easy pass\r\ninto Wadi Didaut, and then winds about as a narrow gorge shut in\r\nby high hills. Just where it leaves the foot of O Shakafa, there\r\nis a track from the east side of the wadi over a very easy pass\r\ninto the head of Wadi Orgem. =Bir Meisah= is a well sunk in the\r\nalluvium of the wadi bed about three kilometres below O Shakafa,\r\nand 410 metres above sea-level. When I visited it in March 1908,\r\nit was filled with downwash, and as there was plenty of water in\r\nthe rock basins of the mountains further north there was then no\r\nnecessity to dig it out. The Arabs say the well is about ten metres\r\ndeep, and its water is not so good as that obtainable from the galts,\r\nso that they only open it when the other sources in the neighbourhood\r\nare exhausted. Two gullies entering Wadi Meisah from the east, just\r\nbelow the well, each contain large galts, called =Meis-heit-ar=, a\r\nshort distance up from their mouths; these were both yielding good\r\nand plentiful water supplies in the spring of 1908. After winding\r\nabout among the hills for ten kilometres below the well, Wadi Meisah\r\nreceives a feeder from the west having three heads. The northern\r\none, =Akla Da-Aiyob=, is a very sandy gully, in fact it is choked\r\nby drift sand, and all the trees in it are dead. The central one,\r\ncoming westward from among high hills, is called =Hanqun Ra-ub=,\r\nwhile the southern one, called the =Wadi Eqaiyib=, is only separated\r\nfrom Meisah at its head by an easy pass, so that it almost forms a\r\nloop of Meisah itself. To go from Bir Meisah to Bir Um Bishtit, one\r\ncrosses this pass into Wadi Eqaiyib, then up Akla Da-aiyob, and over\r\nanother easy pass at its head into Wadi Um Bishtit; the total distance\r\nbetween the two wells by this route is only sixteen kilometres.\r\n\r\nIn its lower stages Wadi Meisah traverses broad open sandy spaces\r\nbetween low hills, receiving a number of small feeders from either\r\nside. It curves round to the eastward a little south of the hills of\r\nEqrun and then courses in a north-easterly direction across the sandy\r\ncoast-plain to the sea. In the last stages of its course its channel\r\nis very ill-defined, the drainage spreading over the plain. The trees,\r\nwhich are fairly abundant in its upper parts, become fewer as one\r\ndescends, but its lower portions are not always entirely barren, for\r\nafter recent rain short grass springs up in its broad shallow bed and\r\naffords a moderate amount of grazing for sheep. The slope of the wadi\r\nfloor just below the well is about ten metres per kilometre; lower\r\ndown, the gradient gradually lessens, and in the last forty kilometres\r\nof its course is only a little over five metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Kiraf=, the next wadi to enter the sea south of Meisah, is\r\nreally the terminal portion of the great =Wadi Di-ib=, the name Kiraf\r\nbeing only applied to the drainage from the point of junction of the\r\nWad el Qireira with Di-ib to the sea, that is, for a distance of some\r\nthirty-one kilometres up from its mouth. The Wadi Di-ib is probably\r\nthe most important and remarkable of all the seawards draining wadis\r\nof the Eastern Desert of Egypt and the Northern Sudan. I have only\r\nseen that terminal portion of its length which lies in Egypt, that\r\nis, north of the 22nd parallel; but the examinations of that length\r\n(the part of it lying within Egyptian territory, including Kiraf,\r\nis some eighty-five kilometres) is enough to show that the wadi must\r\ndrain an enormous basin, for the average slope is the remarkably\r\nsmall one of two metres per kilometre, and the wadi floor in many\r\nplaces, instead of being sandy, consists of mud similar to that of\r\nthe Nile Valley. According to the “Sudan Handbook,” it rises far\r\nto the south, probably near the 20th parallel, and flows generally\r\nnorthwards, so that its length must be well over 300 kilometres. Just\r\nbefore it enters Egypt proper, there is an expansion in its bed\r\ncovered with rich alluvial mud, on which crops of _durra_ are grown;\r\nmy camels were fed for some weeks on _durra_ obtained from this source\r\nwhilst I was working in the neighbourhood. In the present volume I\r\nshall only deal with that portion of Di-ib and its tributaries which\r\nlie north of the 22nd parallel, describing first the main channel\r\nand afterwards its principal tributaries.\r\n\r\nWadi Di-ib enters Egypt a little west of the 36th meridian, as a\r\nbroad sandy drainage channel with many trees. Its bed is here only 170\r\nmetres above sea-level. Wadi Di-ib receives two feeders from the east\r\nnear the 22nd parallel; the Wadi Shendib,[100] draining the western\r\nflanks of the high mountain mass of Gebel Shendib, is believed to join\r\nWadi Di-ib a little south of the frontier, while the Wadi Hareitra,\r\ndraining the north-eastern flanks of Gebel Shendib and the western\r\nslopes of Gebel Hanquf, probably enters Di-ib a little north of\r\nit. For the first eighteen kilometres of its course north of 22°,\r\nWadi Di-ib flows northward over a sandy plain, with low hills and\r\nridges, their feet often swathed in drift sand, on either side. It\r\nthen receives an important tributary from the west, called Wadi el\r\nQurat, draining the north slopes of Gebel Shiab and the hilly country\r\nbetween Gebel Mashushenai and Adar Aweib. After receiving Wadi el\r\nQurat, Wadi Di-ib enters mountainous country, being shut in for some\r\nfifteen kilometres by Adar Aweib on the east and Gebel Balatitda\r\non the west. In its northerly course here Wadi Di-ib receives many\r\nfeeders from the hills, of which two entering from opposite sides\r\nnear Bir Meheriqa are of interest. That from the east is really a\r\ndrainage channel from the sandy plain south of Gebel Sul Hamid; but\r\nit is choked by huge accumulations of drift sand so that the drainage\r\nnever reaches Wadi Di-ib, but accumulates in a depression called O\r\nHarbub, about four kilometres above its mouth. This channel, though\r\nvery sandy, is quite a practicable road, as I found by traversing\r\nit on my way to Gebel Elba from Bir Meheriqa. The feeder from the\r\nwest, which enters Wadi Di-ib about one and a half kilometres below\r\nBir Meheriqa, is called =Wadi Salalob=; it drains the north face\r\nof Adar Aweib, and heads in a very steep pass into Wadi Wieqwer. I\r\nmanaged to get my riding camel over this pass only with difficulty\r\nwhen unmounted, and it is quite impracticable for loaded camels;\r\nthe rise in the last kilometre before reaching the top of the pass\r\nfrom the direction of Wadi Di-ib is over one hundred metres, the\r\nsummit of the pass being 315 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Bir Meheriqa= is a spring situated in the mouth of a small gully at\r\nthe foot of Gebel Balatitda, close to the east side of Wadi Di-ib,\r\nand practically on the same level as the wadi floor (120 metres above\r\nsea-level), so that it is extremely easy of access. The floor of the\r\ngully is covered with conglomerate of recent formation and in this are\r\nseveral holes with pools of clear water about one metre in diameter\r\nby twenty centimetres deep, which fill as fast as emptied. The water\r\nis rather salt, but is drinkable. The portion of Wadi Di-ib which\r\nlies among the mountains has a floor of sandy mud, with abundance\r\nof trees and plants, among which several gazelles were grazing as\r\nI passed through.\r\n\r\nAbout six kilometres below Bir Meheriqa, Wadi Di-ib is joined from\r\nthe west by Wadi Warabeit, which drains a rather large extent of\r\nhigh hills to the west and cuts through the hills north of Adar\r\nAweib to reach Wadi Di-ib. This wadi forms the route to Bir Meisah\r\nfrom Bir Meheriqa _via_ the well known easy passes of Bani Sana and\r\nSarob Kwan; the total distance is about sixty-five kilometres.\r\n\r\nSoon after receiving Wadi Warabeit, Wadi Di-ib gets into lower hill\r\ncountry, with great accumulations of drift sand. From near Gebel\r\nTishushi Tiboki it receives the =Wadi Qumad Lim= from the north-west,\r\nand then after passing the extensive group of low hills of Tishushi\r\nit is joined by the Wad el Qireira, which drains a large area east\r\nof Hadal Aweib Meisah.\r\n\r\nFrom its junction with Wad el Qireira to the sea, Wadi Di-ib is\r\ncalled by the special name of Wadi Kiraf. It is merely an ill-defined\r\ndrainage channel coursing north-east across a great sandy plain\r\nfor a distance of thirty-one kilometres to the sea, with only one\r\ninsignificant feeder, =Halal Hendiyeb=, joining it from the westward\r\nclose to the dark little hill called Einiwai. The Wadi Kiraf is almost\r\nbarren, the great accumulations of sand about the lower parts of Wadi\r\nDi-ib probably absorbing most of the drainage. But to the west of the\r\nmouth of Kiraf there is quite a dense growth of bushes and trees,\r\ncovering a large tract and visible from low hills at considerable\r\ndistances. This locality is called =Shekra el Delam=; I did not visit\r\nit, but the Arabs say there is no wadi there, and it is possibly\r\ndue to the drainage of Wadi Kiraf running below the surface of the\r\nsandy plain and being dammed back by the sea. A salt well, called\r\n=Bir Adal Deib=, exists close to the shore in the same locality.\r\n\r\nOf the =Wadi Shendib=, only a few of the heads are situated in\r\nEgypt, Gebel Shendib being a mass of mountains cut through by the\r\n22nd parallel. Collecting from the west face of the mountain group,\r\na number of drainage lines unite, in the lower hills flanking the\r\nmain mass, to form the main channel of Wadi Shendib, which courses\r\nwestward through low hill country a little south of the 22nd parallel\r\nto join Wadi Di-ib. None of the heads have been surveyed in detail;\r\ntheir position is shown on the map from the statements of guides\r\ncombined with the knowledge gained by triangulating fourteen of the\r\nprincipal peaks and sketching the mountain forms from a considerable\r\ndistance. As the mountain peaks are of great height (the highest peak\r\nof Shendib, marked by an iron beacon, is 1,912 metres above sea)\r\nand frequently wrapped in clouds for days or even weeks together,\r\nit is probable that the heads of Wadi Shendib are very steep and\r\nconvey considerable streams at certain seasons.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Hareitra=, which lies just within Egypt, has likewise only been\r\nsketched in from a distance, but having been approached more closely\r\nits course is better known than that of Wadi Shendib. Its main head\r\nis nearly on the frontier, in longitude 36° 20′, between Gebels\r\nShendib and Hanquf. From its head it makes a nearly quadrantal turn\r\nnorthward and westward, with a radius of about ten kilometres, among\r\nthe mountains from which it receives tributaries, and then crosses\r\nthe plain westward, turning south-west among low dark hills to join\r\nWadi Di-ib after a course of about forty to forty-five kilometres\r\nfrom its head.\r\n\r\nThe unnamed drainage channel which is blocked by sand at =O Harbub=\r\nbefore reaching Wadi Di-ib heads in a tract of low hills with\r\nsandy interspaces about thirteen kilometres west of Gebel Elba;\r\nit receives no part, however, of the drainage of Elba itself, which\r\ngoes northward by other more important channels. It is a broad and\r\nshallow ill-defined drainage line across the sandy plain, with very\r\nfew trees, but its feeders from the low hill tract of Sul Hamid\r\nare less barren. The principal interest of this drainage line lies\r\nin its forming a convenient direct road from Bir Meheriqa to Bir\r\nAkwamtra and Halaib, being far less sandy, as well as shorter, than\r\nany alternative route round the north side of Sul Hamid. In using\r\nthis road, one leaves the drainage line to the south on the plain,\r\nand skirts the hills of Sul Hamid till one reaches the flat sandy\r\ndivide at the head of Wadi Eikwan, with the “Scragged hill” of\r\nQash Amir in view. Here one turns eastward about four kilometres\r\nsouth of Qash Amir, and follows an easy pass into Wadi Siamtit,\r\na small feeder of Wadi Yoider, whence tracks lead to Bir Akwamtra,\r\nBir Kansisrob, and Halaib.\r\n\r\n=Wadi el Qurat=, which joins Wadi Di-ib from the west in latitude\r\n22° 8′, is a broad wadi with great abundance of trees. Its main\r\nhead, which has not been surveyed in detail, appears to be in Gebel\r\nShiab, about twenty-four kilometres above its junction with Di-ib,\r\nand the first part of its course is through a rugged tract of low\r\nhills. Before reaching Wadi Di-ib it is joined by the =Wadi Dibir=,\r\nand Wadi Hashimaiyib on the north and by =Wadi Oshqeq= on the\r\nsouth. The northern feeders are rather complex, owing to numerous\r\nanastomosings and cross-connexions in the low hill country between\r\nGebel Mashushenai and Adar Aweib; but they contain abundance of\r\nvegetation and give good grazing grounds. The short Wadi Dibir heads\r\nin =Wadi Mashushenai=, part of the drainage of which it captures. Wadi\r\nMashushenai is a little wadi to the south of Gebel Mashushenai, with\r\na well, =Bir Mashushenai=, near its head; part of its drainage goes\r\nsouth to Wadi Dibir as above mentioned, while the rest continues as\r\nWadi Mashushenai, flowing south-eastward among low hills for about\r\nfive kilometres to join Wadi Hashimaiyib.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Hashimaiyib= heads between Gebel Warabeit and Gebel\r\nMashushenai. Curving round the north of Gebel Mashushenai almost in\r\na semicircle, it runs south-south-east among low hills to join Wadi\r\nel Qurat after a course of about sixteen kilometres. Besides the\r\nWadi Mashushenai above-mentioned, Hashimaiyib receives, just before\r\nentering el Qurat, the =Wadi Sinqinyeib=, which drains part of the\r\nwest face of Adar Aweib and the hills west of it, with a length\r\nalong its main channel of ten kilometres. There is an easy road\r\nup this wadi, passing close west of Adar Aweib into Wadi Wieqwer,\r\na tributary of Wadi Warabeit; there is no actual pass, because the\r\nwestward drainage of Adar Aweib actually splits, one part going\r\nnorth by Wadi Wieqwer, and the other south by Wadi Sinqinyeib.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Warabeit= has its most important head at the easy and well\r\nknown pass of =Bani Sana=, leading into Wadi Hamida. It is here a\r\nrather wide wadi, with a fairly rapid fall (about thirteen metres per\r\nkilometre), between the high hills of Gebel Hamida and those forming\r\nthe south prolongation of Gebel Geror, and receives numerous feeders\r\nfrom either side. For the first six kilometres, it runs south-east;\r\nit then arrives at a small open space, where it is joined by eastward\r\ndrainages from Gebels Hamida and Warabeit, and turns rather sharply\r\nto the east-north-east. After coursing in this direction for some\r\nfive kilometres, it enters another open space, where it receives\r\nseveral feeders, the principal being the =Wadi Wieqwer=, draining\r\nnorthwards from the hills west of Adar Aweib. It then receives the\r\n=Wadi Kwileimidaiyeib= from the north, and cuts eastward through\r\nthe hills to join Wadi Di-ib. The total length of the Wadi Warabeit\r\nfrom the pass of Bani Sana to Wadi Di-ib is nineteen kilometres,\r\nand in this length it falls from 335 to 113 metres above sea-level,\r\nso that its average slope is nearly twelve metres per kilometre. Both\r\nthe wadi itself and its feeders are abundantly supplied with trees\r\nand bushes, while coarse grasses abound in places. Wadi Warabeit\r\nforms a convenient road from Bani Sana to Bir Meheriqa, being free\r\nfrom sand and well stocked with camel food.\r\n\r\n=Wad el Qireira=, which joins Wadi Di-ib from the south-west to\r\nform Wadi el Kiraf, is really only the terminal portion of the more\r\nimportant Wadis Didaut and Baueiwai, which join to the north-east\r\nof the conspicuous dark hill mass called Ti Keferiai. It is a\r\nbroad shallow drainage line across the sandy plain, with little\r\nvegetation. To the north of it, small hills are dotted over the\r\nplain, the most important being one of red granite, called Osnei,\r\ncontaining a galt which yields water for some time after rain. To the\r\nsouth are the low hills of Tishushi, partly smothered in drift sand.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Didaut=, a feeder of the Wad el Qireira, commences its course\r\nsouth-west of the hill of Adar Aqdeib. One of its heads leads to the\r\neasy pass of Sarob Kwan, on the road to Bir Meisah. Another leads\r\nto a water source in the hills south of Adar Aqdeib, called =Megwel\r\nDidaut=, while a small feeder a little lower down, coming from Adar\r\nAqdeib, also contains a water source called =Megwel Adar Aqdeib=. Both\r\nthese water sources are within about half an hour’s journey from\r\nthe main wadi. After passing Adar Aqdeib, Wadi Didaut curves round\r\nto the north, receiving feeders from the hills of Um Ein and Qara\r\nSaba to the south, then turns east-north-east, passing between the\r\nhills called Kikeiyet Sharqi and Kikeiyet Gharbi, and then between\r\nthe red granite hills of Adatalob Adara and the black mass of Ti\r\nKeferiai to join Wad el Qireira. The total length of Wadi Didaut is\r\nabout thirty-five kilometres, and its average slope is about eight\r\nmetres per kilometre. Its upper parts possess abundance of vegetation,\r\nthe beautiful flowering bush called Sarob being conspicuous in Sarob\r\nKwan; but in its lower portions it becomes almost lost in drift\r\nsand. There is an easy open track from near Megwel Adar Aqdeib,\r\npassing between the high hills called Qara Saba and Gebel Um Ein,\r\nto the Wadi Baueiwai.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Baueiwai= heads in the mountains south of Hadal Aweib\r\nMeisah. Numerous feeders from the mountains course across a tract,\r\nabout six kilometres in diameter, of very low granite hills called\r\nIarih Meisah; this tract is almost entirely shut in by mountains\r\nand high hills, with an outlet south-west of Gebel Um Ein. Through\r\nthis outlet the main channel passes, and receives the =Wadi Miatit=,\r\ndraining the mountains of the same name, from the south-west. Curving\r\nin a great sweep round the foot of Gebel Um Ein, Wadi Baueiwai\r\nturns north-eastward, passing close south-east of the hills of Qara\r\nSaba and Ti Keferiai to join the Wadi Didaut and form the Wad el\r\nQireira. From the head of Wadi Baueiwai there appears to be an easy\r\npass by the east side of Hadal Aweib Meisah into the heads of Wadi\r\nMeisah. A small feeder of Wadi Baueiwai, draining the north-east\r\nflanks of Gebel Um Ein, leads to a water source called =Megwel\r\nUm Ein=. Another feeder coming in from the west side of Qara Saba\r\nforms an easy route to Wadi Didaut, as already mentioned above. The\r\nprincipal other tributaries of Wadi Baueiwai are the Wadis Aqwem\r\nand Hamida. =Wadi Aqwem= is a broad and very sandy wadi coursing\r\nnorth-north-east along the west side of Gebel Nubitra, and reaching\r\nWadi Baueiwai in about latitude 22° 18′; it leads to a water source\r\ncalled =Megwel Aqwem=, situated just south of the end of a long spur\r\nof high hills running out north-eastward from Gebel Miatit. Lower down\r\nits course Wadi Aqwem is fed by tributaries from the high hills east\r\nof it, one of which, the =Wadi Nubitra=, contains a well. This well,\r\ncalled =Bir Nubitra=, is said to yield only very small supplies;\r\nit is situated about three kilometres up the Wadi Nubitra, among\r\nhigh hills. One of the many heads of the small Wadi Nubitra leads\r\nnorthwards by an easy pass into the head of Wadi Hamida.\r\n\r\nThe =Wadi Hamida= heads in the mountain of the same name, and courses\r\nparallel to Wadi Aqwem, from which it is separated by a long ridge\r\nof high hills. About one and a half kilometres below its head at the\r\neasy pass into Wadi Nubitra above referred to, it receives a small\r\ngully from the east; by following up this gully, which is narrow and\r\ntortuous, for about a kilometre, one can reach a tiny spring called\r\n=Megwel Hamida=. When I visited it in April 1908, the spring was a\r\nmere trickle, very salt; a galt a little further up the gorge was\r\ndry at the same time, but bears signs of holding a useful store of\r\nwater after rain. About three kilometres below the gully containing\r\nthe spring, Wadi Hamida reaches an opening whence one can either\r\ngo south-east for two kilometres to the easy pass of Bani Sana, or\r\nnorth-west through a gap in the longitudinal ridge which encloses the\r\nwadi on the left. Wadi Hamida itself, however, keeps straight on its\r\ncourse past Gebel Geror, and joins Wadi Baueiwai south-east of the\r\nhill of Ti-Keferiai. The heads of Wadi Hamida contain a fair amount\r\nof vegetation, but its lower parts are more barren and very sandy.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Di-it= drains the north parts of the hill mass of Sul Hamid,\r\nand courses north-east to reach the coast independently about latitude\r\n22° 29′. It has not been explored, and is of no great importance;\r\nvegetation in it is probably confined to its upper parts among the\r\nhills. Of its total course of about thirty-five kilometres, a large\r\nportion lies over the sandy coast-plain.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Eikwan= is a broad shallow and sandy channel draining the high\r\njagged hill called Qash Amir and the eastern parts of the low hill\r\nmass of Sul Hamid. Its head is about four kilometres south of Qash\r\nAmir, in the flat sandy plain. Taking at first a northerly direction\r\npast the west side of Qash Amir, it turns to the north-east further on\r\nand crosses the coast-plain to reach the sea only a little south of\r\nthe mouth of Di-it. Its total length is about thirty six kilometres,\r\nand its average slope is about nine metres per kilometre.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Yoider=, the next wadi to the east, is of considerable\r\nimportance, as it drains the west portion of Gebel Elba and its heads\r\nare extremely rich in trees and other vegetation, while one of its\r\ntributaries contains a large well of good water (Bir Akwamtra). The\r\nmain head of Wadi Yoider may be considered to be the wadi which bears\r\nthe special name of =Wadi O Sir Hadal=, draining the south-west flanks\r\nof Gebel Elba and the north-west flanks of Gebel Hanquf, and heading\r\nin an easy pass close to the well of =Bir Salalat O Sir=, about 450\r\nmetres above sea-level. Wadi O Sir Hadal courses north-west between\r\nthe mountain ranges for about eight kilometres, receiving a rather\r\nlarge feeder from the south about six kilometres below its head. It\r\nthen emerges from the mountains and turns north among lower hills,\r\nhere receiving the =Wadi Qeirat=, draining westwards from near the\r\nsummit of Elba. A few kilometres further on it enters an open plain\r\nsloping rapidly downwards to the north, receiving the small and narrow\r\n=Wadi Siamtit= from between two high hill masses to the west. From\r\nhere onwards Wadi Yoider courses in gentle curves a little north of\r\neast to reach the coast in about latitude 22° 27′. A well called\r\n=Bir Nabit=, situated in Wadi Yoider, a few hundred metres up from\r\nits mouth, is believed to yield only brackish water. In its journey to\r\nthe coast Wadi Yoider receives several feeders from among the rugged\r\ngranite hills of El Sela to the west of it, as well as the important\r\n=Wadi Akwamtra= from the north-east flank of Gebel Elba. The head\r\nof this Wadi Akwamtra is quite close to the summit of Elba, and its\r\ncourse is at first almost due west, afterwards changing to nearly\r\nnorth among the lower flanking hills, and dividing into two channels\r\nwhich re-unite lower down. =Bir Akwamtra=, one of the best water\r\nsources in the Bisharin country, is situated at an altitude of 330\r\nmetres above sea-level in the eastern channel of Wadi Akwamtra, about\r\nthree kilometres up above the place where it leaves the hills. It is\r\nan excavation in the stony floor of the wadi. The water in April 1908\r\nwas about four metres below the wadi floor, and formed a pool about\r\ntwo metres in diameter in a wide open hollow which filled as fast\r\nas it could be emptied. The water was of excellent quality. There\r\nare two other wells a few hundred metres further down the same wadi;\r\none of these contained a little water, while the other was dry, and\r\nonly the principal well was being used. The floor of the wadi near and\r\nabove the well is very stony, so that it is not a very good camping\r\nground, and the Hamedorab Arabs pitch their tents of matting further\r\ndown the wadi. When I visited the place there were numerous Bisharin\r\nArabs at the well with their women and children, all busily employed\r\nin watering their flocks and herds and washing their clothes. The\r\nwadi, in spite of its stony floor, is literally full of large trees,\r\nprincipally acacias, so close together that laden camels cannot\r\npick their way through them for more than a short distance above\r\nthe well, and thousands of doves inhabit the trees. There are some\r\nruins near the wells, built of boulders set in mud; they are said to\r\nhave been erected by Dervishes in 1886, when they seized Halaib and\r\nBir Akwamtra. These Dervishes were killed off by Egyptian troops,\r\nsome of them being chased to Bir Meisah and shot there.\r\n\r\nAs the densely wooded and stony character of Wadi Akwamtra prevents\r\ncamels from passing up it much above the well, I found it necessary,\r\nin order to pitch a camp within a reasonable distance of the summit\r\nof Gebel Elba, to descend Wadi Akwamtra for about a kilometre\r\nand to cross the Asut Duk pass leading east into the head of Wadi\r\nYahameib. This pass is too steep for loaded camels, and even riding\r\ncamels have to be led down it; baggage camels have to go round the\r\nhill spurs north of the pass. The head of Wadi Yahameib is also full\r\nof trees and scrub, but it is possible to get camels up within four\r\nkilometres of the summit of Elba by this route, whereas Bir Akwamtra\r\nis over six kilometres from it.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Aideib=, with its principal tributary the Wadi Yahameib, drains\r\nthe north-east portion of Gebel Elba and reaches the sea in about\r\nlatitude 22° 21′. A well, called =Bir Abu Ramad=, is situated in\r\nthe wadi bed not far from the sea; like that of almost all the wells\r\nclose to the coast, its water is probably brackish. The main head of\r\nWadi Aideib is on the east side of the main peaks of Elba. Coursing\r\nat first north-eastward, this drainage channel runs through an\r\nopen sloping plain about one and a half kilometres wide between\r\nthe mountain spurs, its channel here dividing into a great loop\r\nwith numerous feeders from the ranges on either side. Passing west\r\nof the high isolated granite mass of Karam Elba, it runs northward\r\nover the sloping plain, receiving the Wadi Yahameib from the west\r\nnear the low red granite hills called Ti Hamra, and then courses\r\nnorth of east to the sea.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Yahameib= originates on the north-west flanks of Gebel Elba,\r\nwhere steep well wooded gorges unite in a steeply sloping stony\r\nplain, covered with trees and scrub, between two great spurs of the\r\nmountain. There is no pass at its main head, but just before it enters\r\nthe plain there is a small feeder from among the hills to the west,\r\nby following up which one can get over a rather steep pass called\r\n=Asut Duk=; this pass forms a short cut for unladen camels between\r\nthe wells of Kansisrob and Akwamtra, but is too steep for animals\r\nloaded with baggage. Curving round to the east, Wadi Yahameib is fed,\r\njust before it joins Wadi Aideib, by the =Wadis Akau= and =Kansisrob=,\r\nboth draining the north parts of a great spur of Gebel Elba. Wadi Akau\r\ncontains a small spring, called =Megwel Akau=, a short distance above\r\nits opening from the hills, while Wadi Kansisrob contains a great well\r\nof good water called =Bir Kansisrob=, a short distance up from its\r\nmouth. Bir Kansisrob is second only to Bir Akwamtra in importance,\r\nand there are usually many Bisharin camps in the wadi just below\r\nit. Like all the wadis draining from Elba, Wadis Yahameib and Aideib\r\nare full of trees and scrub and grasses; in going to the foot of Elba\r\nup the head of Wadi Yahameib with baggage camels, much more difficulty\r\nis caused by the closeness of the trees and scrub than by the stony\r\nnature of the floor. The Elba district is, I believe, the only place\r\nin the Eastern Desert of Egypt where vegetable growth is so abundant\r\nas seriously to hinder one’s caravan in approaching the mountains;\r\nfor the progress of baggage camels to be arrested while still four\r\nor five kilometres from a peak by the steep and stony nature of the\r\nground is common enough; but for the arrest to be due to trees and\r\nscrub was a new and interesting experience. Even the sand dunes on\r\nthe west side of Wadi Yahameib are half-covered with coarse grasses,\r\nand look green instead of the usual yellow. When we could get no\r\nfurther with our camping equipment, Mr. Bakewell, who had been in\r\nSouth Africa, informed me that we were in what would be called in\r\nthat country “open bush”; but in comparison with the rest of\r\nthe desert the place was a jungle.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Todhi= drains the high hills about Karam Elba. In the upper\r\npart of its course it flows north-east between Karam Elba and a\r\nrange of lower granite hills called Mikeriba; emerging thence on\r\nto the plain, its drainage spreads out over a tract, called =Karam\r\nHindi=, covered with trees, whence part drains to the Wadi Aideib\r\nwhile another part goes to the sea near Suakin el Qadim.\r\n\r\n=Suakin el Qadim=, is a collection of mounds close to the sea a little\r\nsouth of latitude 22° 20′. Bent, who visited the place in 1896,\r\nfound “nothing earlier than Cufic remains, unless the graves,\r\nformed of four large blocks of madrepore sunk deep into the ground,\r\nmay be looked upon as a more ancient form of sepulture.”[101]\r\nMy native assistant reported there was no well at the place, nor\r\nanything of interest besides the graves.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Delowa= is a small wadi entering the sea about six kilometres\r\nsouth-east of Suakin el Qadim. It originates in the low hill country\r\nnear Mikeriba and flows north-east between the little red hill of\r\nAlafot and the low banks called Alafot Onqwab on the north and the\r\ngranite hills of Kreishim and Taar Ara on the south.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Serimtai= is an important drainage line, the main head of\r\nwhich is situated in the Sudan, probably near the great mountain of\r\nAsotriba. It enters Egypt in longitude 36° 22′, coursing northward\r\nbetween Gebel Hanquf and Gebel Shendodai, from which last-named\r\nmountain it receives a feeder called =Wadi Um Seyal=. After passing\r\nGebel Shendodai it crosses a tract of low granite hills to the foot\r\nof Gebel O Sir Eirab, where it receives the wadi of the same name and\r\nnumerous feeders from Gebel Hanquf. It then turns north-east, passing\r\nalong the foot of the spurs of Elba, and north of the granite hills\r\nof O Wota and Abai Sis to reach the sea ten kilometres north-west of\r\nHalaib. About twenty-five kilometres up from its mouth, Wadi Serimtai\r\ncontains a well called =Bir Sararat Serimtai=, which has, however,\r\nnot been visited. The =Wadi O Sir Eirab=, an important tributary of\r\nSerimtai, drains the south flanks of Gebel Elba, coursing at first\r\nsouth-west and then turning sharply eastward. At the turn is a well in\r\nthe wadi floor called =Bir Salalat O Sir=, 440 metres above sea-level,\r\nclose to which is an easy pass leading into the head of Wadi O\r\nSir Hadal, a tributary of Wadi Yoider. From its entry into Egypt\r\nto its mouth, Wadi Serimtai has a length of forty-five kilometres,\r\nand an average slope of twelve and a half metres per kilometre. It\r\ncontains plenty of trees and scrub, especially in its upper parts.\r\n\r\n=Mera Kwan= is a wadi draining north-eastward from Gebel Shendodai\r\nand entering the sea a little north of Halaib. It has not been\r\nsurveyed in detail, but as it drains from high mountains it doubtless\r\ncontains plenty of vegetation, especially in its upper parts. The\r\nlower half of its course is rather sandy, passing among low hills\r\non to the coast-plain.\r\n\r\n=Halaib=, the only permanent village on the Red Sea coast of Egypt\r\nsouth of Qoseir,[102] is situated in latitude 22° 13′ 25″ N.,\r\nlongitude 36° 38′ 56″ E.[103] The name of the place is pronounced\r\nlocally Oleiyib, and though I have retained the established European\r\nspelling as given on the charts, none of the natives would recognise\r\nthe name if pronounced in its Europeanised form. Its most conspicuous\r\nbuildings, and the only ones composed of masonry in any form, are a\r\nfort and a block-house; there are a few rude wooden shanties, mostly\r\nbuilt of timber which has been cast up on the beach, but the bulk of\r\nthe population live in little reed huts and tents of matting. Halaib\r\nis the headquarters of a small police force under the command of a\r\nmoawen, the men being lodged in the fort. The fort, which stands about\r\nforty metres from the sea on low ground, is an irregular octagon in\r\nplan, about ten metres in diameter by six and a half metres high. As\r\nits top is only eight metres above the sea and there are low banks\r\nwest of it, the fort is not very conspicuous as one approaches it\r\nfrom the landward side, but being whitewashed and open to the sea\r\nit is a good landmark for sailors in the neighbourhood. It has two\r\nflagstaffs, from which the British and Egyptian flags are flown on\r\nFridays. The fort is entered by a ladder, the floor forming the\r\npolice quarters being about three metres above ground. Below are\r\nwater tanks, and above a trap door gives access to the roof, which\r\nis carried on iron rails and plastered over with stucco. The roof\r\nvibrates too much for it to be used as a triangulation station,\r\nand observations here were taken from an eccentric point on the\r\nground and afterwards reduced to centre. The block-house is a smaller\r\nrectangular structure, whitewashed, situated on a low bank about 400\r\nmetres south-west of the fort. A small jetty, built of coral, runs\r\nout from near the fort far enough for a small boat to get alongside.\r\n\r\nThere are five wells at Halaib, all within a few hundred metres of\r\nthe fort. The water is very hard, and exerts a very strongly aperient\r\naction on those unused to it, though the Arabs of the place consider\r\nit very good. A small Government garden near the fort contains a few\r\nsmall date palms, but there is no other cultivation. There is a sort\r\nof bazaar, where one can buy clothes, sugar, dates, fat, etc., but\r\nthe supplies are small and there was no flour to be got when I was\r\nthere. Eggs can be purchased from the Arabs, who possess a few fowls,\r\nand excellent fish can be got very cheaply from the fishermen. For\r\na daily wage of eight piastres a fisherman supplied me with as much\r\nfresh fish daily as I and my men could eat. Sheep can be got from the\r\nhills at a day’s notice, a good fat one costing L.E. 1. Firewood\r\nhas to be brought in from the mountains, and any European making\r\na stay at the place would do well to send to Bir Kansisrob or Bir\r\nFrukit for pure water at the same time. The people are very friendly,\r\nbut only a few speak Arabic. There is a _kuttab_ where boys learn\r\nto read and write Arabic under the tuition of a sheikh from Suakin,\r\nso that Arabic may perhaps be more spoken after another generation.\r\n\r\nThere are two islands a little north of Halaib, both low and\r\nsandy. The larger one, called =Geziret Halaib el Kebir=, is nearly\r\ntriangular, with sides about three and a half kilometres long. It\r\ncan be reached easily by wading across a narrow channel in low\r\nstates of the sea. On it is the grave, marked by a wooden cross, of\r\nLieut. Stewart, R.N., who lost his life in a fight with Dervishes\r\nhere in 1886. The smaller island lies further north; it is called\r\n=Geziret Kwolala=[104] on account of its nearly circular shape.\r\n\r\nHalaib possesses an excellent harbour, though it is sometimes\r\ndifficult of access to sailing vessels owing to the direction of its\r\nentrance.[105] It is visited occasionally by Coast Guard cruisers as\r\nwell as by small trading boats from Suakin. On enquiry of the local\r\nsailors, I found most of the names given on the Admiralty Charts\r\nof this district to be unknown to them. For example, Abu Dara,\r\nSherm Alueda, Ras Abu Fatma, Elba Island, Ras Jazriyal, and Cape\r\nElba were all unknown. Abu Dara was called by the natives Shekra\r\nel Delam, while Elba Island was called Geziret el Dibia, and Cape\r\nElba is locally known as Ras Hadarba. I obtained the following names\r\nfor the small anchorages north and south of Halaib, though I could\r\nnot locate them exactly on the maps, as the sailors could not read\r\na map sufficiently well, and the harbours themselves are mere gaps\r\nthrough the outer coral reef, not visible indentations of the actual\r\ncoast-line. Starting from Bir Adal Deib and going southward, Mersa\r\nAbu el Qâsim is near the mouth of Wadi el Kiraf; a big tree forms a\r\nlandmark for entering it. Further on is Mersa Harâba, then Mersa Abu\r\nNaam with an island opposite to it, then, after passing Ras Unbilat,\r\ncomes Mersa Yoider, at the mouth of Wadi Yoider, where there is a\r\nwell called Bir Nabit. Passing Abu Ramad well in Wadi Aideib, and\r\nSuakin el Qadim, one comes to Mersa Aqwetit, then to Mersa Serimtai,\r\nat the mouth of Wadi Serimtai, opposite the island of Kwolala, and\r\nthen to Mersa Halaib itself. South of Halaib the principal anchorage\r\nis Mersa Shellal, at the mouth of Wadi Shellal. The cape in latitude\r\n22° 10′ is called Ras Qubet Isa. A small anchorage south of Ras\r\nHadarba (Cape Elba) appears to be called indifferently Mersa Hadarba\r\n(from the hills near it) or Mersa Qabatit (from the wadi and well\r\nnear it); but I could not make quite sure if these are one and the\r\nsame, or two separate anchorages.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Shellal= heads between the high mountain masses of Gebels\r\nShendodai and Shellal, and courses north-east for about thirty\r\nkilometres to reach the coast about four kilometres south-east of\r\nHalaib. In its lower part, where it crosses the coast-plain, it is\r\na broad shallow drainage channel full of scrub. Its upper parts,\r\nwhich have not been explored, are doubtless well supplied with trees,\r\nand are stated to be the principal habitat of the Hamedorab Arabs.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Aqilhoq=, which drains the eastern parts of Gebel Shellal,\r\ncourses about parallel to Wadi Shellal a few kilometres further\r\nsouth. It contains a well, =Bir Frukit=, about twenty kilometres up\r\nfrom its mouth, near some dark conspicuous foot hills called Gebel\r\nBalatitda. This well yields a constant supply of very good water,\r\nand is the place where I sent for my water supplies in commencing my\r\nreturn march to Port Sudan. The position of the well as shown on the\r\nmap is only approximate, but its direction having been pointed out\r\nwith the alidade by guides from two plane-table stations, I believe\r\nthe location is pretty nearly correct.\r\n\r\n=Wadi Aqwei= drains east of north from among the foot-hills east\r\nof Gebel Shellal, and enters the sea four kilometres west of Ras\r\nQubet Isa. Where I crossed it two kilometres from its mouth it was\r\na broad shallow wadi with plenty of scrub, dividing round a low but\r\nconspicuous gravel bank before reaching the sea.\r\n\r\n=Kreit-reit-or= is a similar wadi to that last mentioned, coursing\r\nnorth-eastward over the plain from among low hills, and entering the\r\nsea five kilometres south-east of Ras Qubet Isa. About two kilometres\r\nsouth of Kreit-reit-or, at a distance of three and a half kilometres\r\nfrom the coast, and thirty metres above sea-level, are the bitter\r\nwells of =Ti Kureitra=. These are four wells, sunk about twelve metres\r\ndeep in the gypseous strata which here underlie the sand and gravel\r\nof the coast-plain. The wells are lined with slabs of selenite. The\r\nwater is so strongly purgative that a number of my Arabs who drank\r\nof it were made extremely unwell, and the wells are chiefly used for\r\nwatering the flocks of sheep which graze in the neighbouring valleys.\r\n\r\nFrom the group of conspicuous though not very high hills called Gebel\r\nHadarba, ten kilometres west of Ras Hadarba (Cape Elba) many drainage\r\nchannels cross the coast-plain towards the sea in a direction north\r\nof east. Some of the drainage lines form the north side of the hills\r\nreach the sea east of Ti Kureitra wells; but others lose themselves in\r\na quicksand called =Kuatianai=, or “the devourer,” which covers\r\na large triangular space of about twenty square kilometres about the\r\ncape. At the actual cape, rocks are visible at the coast, and the\r\nquicksand, so far as I could judge from a distance, appears to be\r\nreally a lagoon, filled with the sand washed down from the hills. The\r\nArabs state that camels wandering on this sand get swallowed up; the\r\ncolour of its surface is distinctly darker than the rest of the plain.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the 22nd parallel, near the sea are low\r\ngravel-covered banks of calcareous grit, seventy metres high in\r\nplaces, and through these pass several broad wadis draining from\r\nthe low hill country further west. The chief of these wadis, called\r\n=Wadi Qabatit=, enters the sea at a well defined inlet of the coast\r\ncalled Mersa Qabatit. A well, =Bir Qabatit=, is situated in the bed\r\nof another drainage channel a little south of the main wadi, one\r\nand a half kilometres south-east of the mersa and 3·85 kilometres\r\nsouth of the 22nd parallel. The ground at the well is only five\r\nmetres above the sea. The well is a big excavation in the wadi floor,\r\nand its water surface is about at sea-level. To me the water tasted\r\ndecidedly salt, but the Arabs say it does not purge them.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Floyer’s map (_Geog.

The Migif — Hafafit — Nugrus — Hangalia — Zabara group;\r\n\r\n    ii.  The Abu Hamamid — Hamata — Abu Gurdi group;\r\n\r\n   iii.  The Um Gunud — Dahanib — Batoga group;\r\n\r\n    iv.  The Abu Dahr — Orga — Um Tenebda group;\r\n\r\n     v.  The Faraid group;\r\n\r\n    vi.  The Awamtib — Abraq — Dif — Aqab el Negum — Mishbih group;\r\n\r\n   vii.  The Gerf — Korabkansi — Abu Hodeid group;\r\n\r\n  viii.  The Meisah — Adar Qaqa — Is group;\r\n\r\n    ix.  The mountains of the Alaqi basin west of Gebel Adar Qaqa;\r\n\r\n     x.  The Elba — Shendib group;\r\n\r\nwhile there are numerous more or less isolated mountains and hills\r\nlying outside these principal masses. In the present chapter a more\r\ndetailed account will be given of each of the main groups, taking\r\nthem in order from north to south, the principal outlying hill-masses\r\nbeing considered along with the mountain group to which they are\r\nin greatest proximity. It may be remarked that the geographical\r\npositions of all the principal peaks are tabulated in Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\n       =The Migif — Hafafit — Nugrus — Hangalia — Zabara Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highest mountains of the group (_see_ the detailed map on Plate\r\nVI) form a close cluster, round Gebel Nugrus (1,505 metres) as a\r\ncentre, between latitudes 24° 40′ and 24° 55′, while other\r\nmore or less detached masses are scattered to the north and west. A\r\nstriking feature of the central cluster is the tendency to extension\r\nin a north-west and south-east direction, which is specially marked\r\nin the Hafafit and Hangalia ranges.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Nugrus=, the central and highest mountain of this northerly\r\ngroup, is a great boss of red granite rising to a height of 1,505\r\nmetres among schists and gneisses. It is an almost isolated mass,\r\nfor though the Hangalia and Hafafit ranges close in on it from either\r\nside, there are passes both east and west of it by which a circuit of\r\nthe mountain can be made. In plan, it is a pear-shaped mass, about\r\nfourteen kilometres in length by six kilometres in width, having\r\nits long axis north-west and south-east. Gebel Nugrus is on the main\r\nwatershed; its north parts are drained Nilewards by the Wadi Hangalia\r\nand other feeders of Wadi Gerf, while the drainage from its south\r\nportion passes by the Wadi Nugrus and Wadai el Nom to the Wadi Gemal\r\nand thence to the sea. The ascent of the mountain was made from a\r\ncamp about four kilometres west of the summit, at the top of the pass\r\nleading into the stony head of Wadi Nugrus. The divide here is flat\r\nand sandy, at an altitude of 691 metres above sea-level, so that the\r\nascent from camp to summit was 814 metres. Striking eastwards over\r\nthe lower ridges which flank the main back-bone of the mountain,\r\nthe summit was reached after a climb of nearly four hours. When\r\nascended from this side, there appear to be two main peaks, of which\r\nthe further one, marked by a beacon, is the triangulation point;\r\nthe best way up is between the two peaks, as the passage from one\r\nto the other is very rough and steep. Though tiring, the climb is\r\nnot very difficult. The top of the mountain (_see_ Plate VII) is a\r\nmass of great rounded knobs of granite, on which a suitable place\r\nfor setting up instruments was only found after some searching. The\r\nbeacon, in latitude 24° 48′ 34″, longitude 34° 35′ 47″,\r\nis on a rounded eminence not large enough to receive an instrument,\r\nso that eccentric observations were necessary; the distance between\r\nthe eccentric point of observation and the beacon had to be found by\r\na subtense method, as the roughness of the mountain top rendered any\r\nprocess of chaining or taping impossible. The view from the summit\r\nis very fine. To the west, one sees the pinnacles of Migif and the\r\nnearer long range of Hafafit; to the north-east is the black cone of\r\nAtut; northward, seen over a sea of hills, is Igli; to the east is\r\nthe high ridge of Hangalia, culminating to the south in Gebel Zabara.\r\n\r\nThe sea is visible to the north-east and east, but the sea horizon\r\nwas obscured during the three days I spent on the summit by banks of\r\nclouds. These cloud banks simulated the sea horizon very closely,\r\ntheir upper surface appearing perfectly horizontal. They caused\r\na peculiar phenomenon at sunrise, producing the optical effect of\r\ntwo suns rising one after the other owing to the refraction through\r\nthe cloud. The first thing seen was a blood-red image of the sun\r\nrising over the true sea horizon, which was only thus discovered,\r\nthe sun being seen through the cloud; about three minutes later,\r\nwhen a little more than half the blood-red disc had risen, the true\r\nsun rays flashed out from another and much brighter segment appearing\r\nover the top of the cloud, so that parts of two sun disks were seen\r\nat once, quite separately, one over the other.\r\n\r\nBefore descending from the mountain, I went along the ridge south-east\r\nand north-west of the highest point to get plane-table stations; in\r\neither direction progress along the top is extremely difficult. To the\r\nnorth-west it appeared as though the way would be easier by keeping\r\non the east side of the ridge, but in reality this was not so, as the\r\nslope was so steep and smooth that some stretches could only be got\r\nover by wriggling along with as much as possible of one’s body in\r\ncontact with the rock. The descent from the north-west end of the\r\nridge to camp was difficult and rather dangerous in places. It is\r\npossible that a better way up the mountain could be found from the\r\npass at the head of Wadi Hangalia, on the opposite side to where I\r\nstarted; that pass is 120 metres higher than the west one, so that\r\nthe total climb would be lessened by that amount, and the horizontal\r\ndistance is about the same.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hafafit= is a very long range, chiefly of gneiss, running in\r\na nearly straight line south-eastward for over thirty kilometres. Its\r\nhighest peaks are at its north end, where they are not very much lower\r\nthan those of Gebel Nugrus; the heights decrease gradually further\r\nsouth. Half way down the range is a very conspicuous peak called\r\n=Um Moghar=, 860 metres above sea, while another well marked summit,\r\nthe only one which I climbed, exists near the south end and rises to\r\n744 metres. This last-named point is marked by a beacon, in latitude\r\n24° 35′ 32″, longitude 34° 45′ 22″. On either side of the\r\nmain back-bone of Hafafit are high flanking ridges. The drainage of\r\nHafafit practically all flows seaward by the Wadi Gemal; the west\r\nfaces are drained by Wadi Hafafit, and the east ones by Wadi Nugrus.\r\n\r\nEast of the south part of Gebel Hafafit are some remarkable bosses\r\nof granite, of which the chief, Gebel Abu Had, rises to 633 metres\r\nabove sea, and is a landmark for Bir Abu Had. Another remarkable hill,\r\ncloser in to Hafafit and the Wadi Gemal, is shaped like a bell with a\r\nhandle on the top; this hill, which forms a good landmark, is called\r\n=Gebel Um Regeba=, and its summit is 571 metres above the sea.\r\n\r\n                                                            PLATE VII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Summit of Gebel Nugrus. (Granite).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Summit of Gebel Abu Hamamid. (Schists).]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Migif= is a very spiky gneiss mass situated about thirteen\r\nkilometres west of Gebel Nugrus. It has several summits of about\r\nequal height, fairly close together, but separated by deep clefts. The\r\ntriangulation beacon is on the western peak, in latitude 24° 47′\r\n23″, longitude 34° 27′ 30″, 1,199 metres above sea-level. The\r\nfoliation planes of the rock dip to the north, and the only safe\r\nmeans of ascent is up the resulting north slopes. The south aspect\r\nis precipitous. When ascending the mountain, I pitched my camp 2·7\r\nkilometres north of the beacon, in a gully draining into Wadi Shait,\r\nwest of another gully containing the water holes called Galt Um\r\nKaraba, at an altitude of 607 metres above sea-level. The ascent, of\r\n592 metres, took two hours steady climbing, and was not difficult. I\r\nkept on the west side of the gorge till near the top, and this is\r\nthe best way up the mountain, for I found the gorge itself to be\r\nsteep and abounding in impassable precipices. The view from Gebel\r\nMigif is shut in to the east by the high masses of Gebels Hafafit\r\nand Nugrus; Gebels Atut and Igli are conspicuous to the north;\r\nto the south-east, one overlooks the great sandy basin of Wadi\r\nHafafit; while to the south-west is more open country in which the\r\ntwo remarkable cones of El Nahud, the sharp peak of Gebel Abu Khrug,\r\nthe ridge of Gebel Hamrat Selma, and closer in the ranges called Gebel\r\nDweig, are striking features. On a clear day, the huge mountains of\r\nHamata and Abu Hamamid, eighty kilometres to the south-south-east,\r\ncan be discerned. The photographs on Plate VIII will give an idea of\r\nthe views looking towards Gebels Nugrus and Dweig respectively. In\r\nthe upper view Gebel Nugrus is seen behind the Hafafit range; in the\r\nlower, the masses close in are Gebel Dweig, while in the distance,\r\nto the right of the centre, is Gebel Hamrat Selma, and behind it on\r\nthe horizon the spike of Gebel Abu Khrug. The precipitous nature of\r\nthe south side of Gebel Migif is evident in both views.\r\n\r\nThe north and west sides of Gebel Migif are drained by the Wadi\r\nShait, which passes the foot of the mountain; the steep south face\r\ndrains into Wadi Dweig, a tributary of Shait; while the eastern face,\r\nflanked by low hills, is drained by Wadi Hafafit.\r\n\r\nGebel Dweig is a small group of high hills close to the south of\r\nGebel Migif, with which it combines to form a _cul-de-sac_ round the\r\nhead of Wadi Dweig. Gebel Dweig resembles Gebel Migif in character,\r\nexcept that it is lower; the hill on the south side of the narrow\r\nopening by which Wadi Dweig leaves the _cul-de-sac_ is 864 metres\r\nabove sea, and this is believed to be the highest of the group. The\r\neastern part of the mass is a curiously curved range sweeping round\r\nnearly in a semicircle.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hamrat Selma= is a high ridge rising from the plain about\r\nfifteen kilometres south-west of Gebel Migif. I did not approach it\r\nclosely, but fixed the position of its highest point, which is 761\r\nmetres above sea-level, by triangulation.\r\n\r\n=El Nahud= (the breasts) is the name given to two very remarkable\r\nconical hills of volcanic rock rising from the plain on the north\r\nside of Wadi Natash to the south of Gebel Hamrat Selma. The two\r\nhills are about five kilometres apart, one being south-east of the\r\nother. The north-eastern cone is the sharper of the two, but they\r\nhave both the same altitude of 662 metres above the sea and rise\r\nabout 130 metres above the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Khrug= is a granite hill-mass with a remarkably sharp high\r\npeak, about twenty-five kilometres south-west of Gebel Migif. The\r\nsummit, which is surmounted by a triangulation beacon, in latitude\r\n24° 38′ 57″, longitude 34° 16′ 19″, has an altitude of 870\r\nmetres above sea-level. Abu Khrug, from its striking Matterhorn-like\r\nshape and its situation in fairly open country, is a conspicuous\r\nlandmark for great distances. The Arabs who were sent to erect the\r\nbeacon stated that the ascent was very difficult.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Sufra= is a mass of rather flat-topped high hills, partly of\r\nvolcanic origin, about eighteen kilometres west of Abu Khrug, on the\r\nnorth side of Wadi Shait. The triangulation beacon on the summit is in\r\nlatitude 24° 38′ 42″, longitude 34° 4′ 13″, at a height of\r\n690 metres above sea-level, and 340 metres above the well of Um Gubur,\r\nwhich is in the Wadi Shait about three kilometres to the south-east.\r\n\r\n=Gebels Nazla= and =Um Serg= are moderately high hills lying to\r\nthe south of Gebels Sufra and Abu Khrug, between the Wadis Shait\r\nand Natash.\r\n\r\n=Gorf el Natash= is a syenite hill on the south side of Wadi Natash,\r\nabout five kilometres south-west of Bir Masur, while =Gebels Muktil=\r\n(470 metres), =Derera=, and =Um Goraf=, are prominent hills lying\r\nstill further south near Wadi Antar.\r\n\r\n                                                           PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from Gebel Migif, looking east, showing the\r\nHafafit and Nugrus Ranges.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from Gebel Migif, looking south-west, showing\r\nGebel and Wadi Dweig.]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Ras Shait= is a group of high rugged-looking reddish hills,\r\nprobably of granite, at the head of Wadi Shait, near Gebels Nugrus\r\nand Migif. Its highest peak rises to 1,019 metres above sea. The west\r\nface drains directly into Shait, while the eastern and northern slopes\r\ndrain into Wadi Gerf, which joins Shait far to the south-west. Between\r\nGebels Migif and Ras Shait is a small range of hills dividing Wadi\r\nShait from the head of Wadi Hafafit; across the south end of this\r\nrange, which is composed of dark schists with white granite at its\r\nwestern foot, there runs a zigzag pass, fairly easy for camels,\r\nto the head of Wadi Nugrus.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Mudergeg= is a high range of reddish hills, which with Gebels\r\nRas Shait and Migif encloses the heads of Wadi Shait. Its highest\r\npoint is 1,086 metres above sea. To the east of it are several other\r\nlower ranges, some of white and others of black aspect, which have\r\nnot been approached closely.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hangalia= is a great mountain ridge running south-south-east\r\nfor about twelve kilometres, from Gebel Ghuel to Gebel Zabara,\r\nconsisting chiefly of schists. Its highest peak is 1,241 metres above\r\nsea-level. Its western faces are drained partly to the Nile by the\r\nWadi Hangalia (a tributary of Wadi Gerf) and partly to the sea by\r\nthe Wadai el Nom (a tributary of Wadi Nugrus); its eastern faces,\r\nwhich are flanked by high ridges, drain into the various feeders of\r\nWadi Ghadir.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Zabara=, a mountain mass rising to 1,361 metres above\r\nsea-level, forms a southward extension of the Hangalia range. The\r\ncairn on its summit is in latitude 24° 45′ 21″, longitude 34°\r\n41′ 53″. The mountain is drained on the north and east sides\r\nby feeders of the Wadi Ghadir, while its western flanks are partly\r\ndrained by the Wadai el Nom. Gebel Zabara is chiefly composed of\r\nschists of various types. The ancient emerald mines of Zabara are in\r\nthe north-east part of the mountain, about two and a half kilometres\r\nfrom its summit. A triangulation beacon marks the highest point of the\r\nmountain, but this was only used as an intersection point. I ascended\r\nsome of the flanking ridges near the old mines; these consisted of\r\nsplintery schists, and though the climbing is steep and rough (_see_\r\nPlate IX), the schists give a good foothold so that the ascent to the\r\ntop is probably not very difficult. The ruins in the Wadi Zabara, near\r\nthe old mines, are at 514 metres above sea-level; the climb from them\r\nto the summit is thus one of 857 metres. Due south of Gebel Zabara\r\nis a high ridge, the north-west end of which is 1,104 metres above\r\nsea-level; this ridge is the most conspicuous of a mass of high hills\r\nflanking Gebel Zabara to the south, which have not been seen except\r\nfrom a distance, but which are probably drained by the Wadi Nugrus.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Ghuel=, which forms a northward extension of Gebel Hangalia,\r\nis likewise composed of schists. Its highest point, the south end\r\nof a conspicuous high ridge, is 1,104 metres above sea. Its eastern\r\nfaces are drained by the Wadis Ghuel and Fegas, both tributaries\r\nof Wadi Ghadir, while its western flanks drain into the heads of\r\nWadi Um Khariga. High hills flank the main ridge on both sides,\r\nespecially the east, and through these the drainage channels form\r\ndeep gloomy gorges. Wadi Ghuel contains important water holes.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Khariga= is the name given to several high hill ranges\r\non either side of the Wadi Um Khariga. Two of these ranges, one on\r\neither side of the upper part of the wadi, form like Gebel Ghuel north\r\nextensions of the high ridge of Hangalia; the western range can be\r\ncrossed at a gap by an easy pass, 773 metres above sea-level, which\r\nseparates the heads of Wadi Gerf from those of Wadi Um Khariga. These\r\ntwo ranges shut in the wadi on either side for some ten kilometres\r\nof its northward course, beyond which the country becomes more open\r\nand the wadi curves round to the north-east, passing the north end\r\nof a third range of high hills which is likewise called Gebel Um\r\nKhariga. This third range extends northward for about ten kilometres\r\nfrom Gebel Ghuel, from which it is separated by a pass forming a good\r\nroad over the head of Wadi Ghadir. Its most conspicuous feature is\r\na twin peak at its north end, 674 metres above sea-level. The main\r\nridge is flanked by high hills, especially on the east side. Only the\r\nnorth and west flanks of this range are drained by Wadi Um Khariga,\r\nthe eastern side being cut up by feeders of Wadi Sukari. Besides\r\nthe pass separating it from Gebel Ghuel, there are two other passes,\r\none round its north end into Wadi Sukari, and another at its south\r\nend between Wadi Ghadir and Wadi Sukari, so that a complete circuit\r\nof this range can be made by camels. Some of the hills composing\r\nthe mass consist of highly magnetic schists, and compass readings\r\nin the region may be disturbed by many degrees.\r\n\r\n                                                             PLATE IX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Descending Gebel Zabara. (Schists).]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Igli el Iswid= is a rather rugged mountain mass rising among\r\na sea of lower hills, thirty kilometres north of Gebel Nugrus. Its\r\nhighest point, marked by a triangulation beacon, in latitude 25° 4′\r\n6″, longitude 34° 36′ 16″, is 975 metres above sea-level. The\r\nmountain forms a tripartite watershed between the basins of Wadi\r\nUm Khariga (draining the south slopes), Wadi Dabur (draining the\r\nnorth and west slopes), and Wadi Igli (draining the eastern face),\r\neach of which three wadis courses separately to the sea. In occupying\r\nthe triangulation station on the summit, I placed my camp in a gully\r\ndraining to Wadi Um Khariga, about two kilometres south-south-west of\r\nthe summit at an altitude of 605 metres above sea. The climb of 370\r\nmetres to the top from this camp was not difficult, and occupied only\r\na little over an hour and a half. The mountain consists of very hard\r\ngrey siliceous rocks, which ring under the hammer, and are probably\r\ncrushed and devitrified felsites (_see_ p. 281). There are galts in\r\nsome of the gullies draining from this mountain, hence it is sometimes\r\ncalled _Igli el Rayani_. At the time of my visit (December 1905)\r\nthere was said to be a little water in a galt on the west side of the\r\nmass; but the rock basins in the gully which I ascended were empty.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Igli el Ahmar=, sometimes called _El Atshani_, is a lower\r\nhill mass of granite some ten kilometres north-east of Igli el Iswid.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Atut= is a high black conical hill thirty kilometres north-west\r\nof Gebel Nugrus. Rising considerably above the hills which immediately\r\nsurround it, Atut is visible from a great distance from the west,\r\nand its conical form renders it easy of recognition. Its summit,\r\nmarked by a beacon, in latitude 25° 0′ 56″, longitude 34°\r\n23′ 49″, is 908 metres above sea-level and 300 metres above\r\nthe branches of the Rod el Atut which encircle its base. A camp can\r\nbe placed close to the foot of the cone, and the ascent is easily\r\nmade in about an hour. The rock of Gebel Atut is olivine gabbro\r\n(_see_ p. 302), of great hardness, and the whole surface of the\r\nmountain is formed of great blocks, rounded and boulder-like below,\r\nbut angular higher up. The blocks have rusty-looking surfaces, but\r\nare perfectly sound rock inside, and they ring like bells under the\r\nhammer. The upper illustration on Plate X shows a view of the summit\r\nof Gebel Atut, from which its blocky nature will be evident. The\r\nview from Gebel Atut is a very extensive one. To the west and north\r\n(_see_ the lower illustration on Plate X) one can see the peaks of\r\nGebels Muelih, Haggar Dungash, Iteima, Abu Diab, and Hamrat Wogud;\r\nto the south-east are the masses of Migif and Nugrus, while eastward\r\none looks over a great expanse of hills towards Gebels Dabur and Um\r\nKhariga, with the sea beyond.\r\n\r\nThe hills of =Um el Huetat=, the highest of which rise over 200 metres\r\nabove the wadis round them, are situated about eight kilometres due\r\nwest of Gebel Atut; they are composed of schists of various types,\r\nand contain some old mines, mostly in talc schist. They are drained\r\nby the Rod el Farag, a tributary of Wadi Gerf.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Rod el Farag, _i.e._, further west of Gebel\r\nAtut, are numerous scattered hills, the higher of which bear the\r\nnames of =Hamrat Mastura=, =El Hamra=, and =Um Himar=. These are of\r\ngranite, gneiss, and schists, with some coarse gabbro and numerous\r\nquartz veins.\r\n\r\nStill further west is the remarkable ridge called =Erf el Fahid=,\r\na great quartz vein ten metres wide and two kilometres long, rising\r\nnearly one hundred metres above the Wadi Muelih. A beacon on its\r\nhighest point, 579 metres above sea-level, marks the triangulation\r\nstation, its position being latitude 25° 0′ 5″, longitude 34°\r\n11′ 52″. South-east of Erf el Fahid is a line of similar but\r\nsmaller ridges, also formed of great quartz veins rising through\r\ndiorites and schists. Still further down the Wadi Muelih is a curious\r\nhorse-shoe-shaped hill of aplite, called =Marwot Rod el Ligaia=,\r\nround which the hills of crushed diorite are penetrated with a\r\nnetwork of quartz veins running in various directions.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Muelih= is a great boss of white granite situated close to the\r\nnorth side of Wadi Muelih in longitude 34°. Its summit, marked by\r\na beacon, in latitude 24° 52′ 44″, longitude 34° 0′ 37″,\r\nis 707 metres above sea and 350 metres above the wadi which courses\r\nround its south flank, and from which it is easily climbed. The\r\nupper view on Plate XI gives an idea of its appearance as seen from\r\nthe base line camp in the wadi six kilometres east of it.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hagar Dungash= is a great mass of high hills situated north of\r\nGebel Muelih. The beacon on its highest point, in latitude 24° 59′\r\n12″, longitude 34° 2′ 33″, is 815 metres above sea-level. In\r\nthe hills which flank the main mass are numerous sharp peaks, one of\r\nthe most conspicuous of which, eight and a half kilometres south-west\r\nof the beacon, is called =Gebel Um Dalalil=. A ridge five kilometres\r\ndue east of the beacon bears the name of =Erf Rod Um Rashid=. The\r\nrocks of Haggar Dungash are chiefly dark schists.\r\n\r\n                                                              PLATE X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Summit of Gebel Atut.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from Gebel Atut, looking north-west, showing\r\nGebels Abu Diab and Hamrat Wogud in the distance.]\r\n\r\n                                                             PLATE XI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View in Wadi Muelih (Base-line Camp). Gebel Muelih\r\nin the Distance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Granite-boss of Gebel Selaia.]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Iteima= is a group of high granite hills rising from the\r\nplain fifteen kilometres north of Erf el Fahid. Its highest peak is\r\n849 metres above the sea. It is drained southwards by the Wadi Muelih.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hamrat Wogud=, which is likewise of granite, is a higher\r\nmountain mass fifteen kilometres east of Iteima. Its highest point,\r\nmarked by a beacon, is in latitude 25° 9′ 34″, longitude 34°\r\n20′ 0″, and 1,103 metres above sea. It is drained southwards by\r\nthe Rod Um el Farag, a tributary of Wadi Gerf.\r\n\r\nBetween Gebels Muelih and Mudergeg is a sandy plain with low hills,\r\nthe more conspicuous of which bear special names; among them are\r\n=Marwot Rod el Ligah=, =Erf Sagur=, and =Khusa el Faraon=, the\r\nlast-named being a group of small but very remarkable black hills\r\neleven kilometres due south of Erf el Fahid. Marwot Rod el Ligah is\r\na triangulation point; its beacon is 514 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Sukari= is a very craggy high ridge of granitic rock\r\ntwenty-two kilometres north of Gebel Zabara. Its highest point,\r\nwhich is at its north end, is 630 metres above sea-level, but the\r\ntriangulation beacon was erected on a lower part of the ridge further\r\nsouth, in latitude 24° 56′ 50″, longitude 34° 42′ 50″,\r\nat an altitude of 476 metres, in order to be near to the extensive\r\nold mines and ruins which exist in the locality. Gebel Sukari is\r\ndrained by various feeders of Wadi Sukari.\r\n\r\n=Kurdeman= is the name of a low hilly district on the east side\r\nof Wadi Ghadir, thirteen kilometres north of Gebel Zabara. It is\r\ninteresting as containing some ancient mines, doubtless worked for\r\ngold. A triangulation beacon has been erected on a hill just above the\r\nworkings, in latitude 24° 52′ 35″, longitude 34° 41′ 35″,\r\nat an altitude of 526 metres above sea, or about fifty metres above\r\nthe wadi.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Sabahia= is a craggy felsite hill five kilometres south-east\r\nof Kurdeman, rising to 520 metres above sea, or about ninety metres\r\nabove the wadi. It is drained by the Wadi Sabahia, a tributary of\r\nWadi Ghadir. In the heads of the Wadi Sabahia, north-east of the hill,\r\nare some old gold mines.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Tundeba= is a high granite hill near the head of Wadi Um\r\nTundeba. Its summit is 550 metres above the sea. It forms a landmark\r\nfor the water hole called Galt Um Tundeba, which is situated in a\r\nsmall gully, three kilometres west of the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Amba-ut=, seven kilometres south of the foregoing, is likewise\r\nbelieved to be of granite; the southern hill of this group is of a red\r\ncolour and very conspicuous as one passes from Um Tundeba to Ghadir.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Ghadir=, the summit of which, in latitude 24° 50′ 9″,\r\nlongitude 34° 47′ 22″, and 636 metres above sea, is marked\r\nby a triangulation beacon, is thirteen kilometres north-east of\r\nGebel Zabara. I ascended it from a camp 424 metres above sea-level\r\nin one of the gullies draining westward to Wadi Ghadir. The ascent\r\nis easy. The rocks are greenish serpentines and ophicalcites below,\r\nwith a white quartz felsite above.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Allawi=, situated on the south side of the Wadi Allawi, is a\r\ndiorite hill rising to 515 metres above sea. It is best approached\r\nby ascending a small feeder of Wadi Allawi, in which a camp can be\r\nplaced within a kilometre of the summit and 160 metres below it. There\r\nare some interesting old gold mines in the quartz veins just below\r\nthe beacon on the summit of the hill, and a band of graphitic schist\r\ncrops out near the north foot of the hill. The position of the beacon\r\nis latitude 24° 46′ 42″, longitude 34° 49′ 39″.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Lewewi= is a dark craggy hill range eight kilometres\r\neast-south-east of Gebel Zabara, between Wadi Allawi and its tributary\r\nWadi Lewewi. Its highest point, marked by a cairn, is 654 metres\r\nabove sea-level. There are some old mines in the lower hills two\r\nand half kilometres south-east of Gebel Lewewi, and others a little\r\nfurther off in the same direction.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Sikait= is a rugged ridge of schists and serpentine situated\r\nin the midst of hilly country fourteen kilometres south-east of\r\nGebel Zabara. The triangulation beacon which marks its summit is\r\nin latitude 24° 39′ 55″, longitude 34° 48′ 5″, and 771\r\nmetres above sea-level, and 330 metres above the wadi which skirts its\r\nwestern foot. Gebel Sikait is of interest from the abundant ruins and\r\nold emerald mines which exist near it, as well as from the variety\r\nof minerals present in its rocks. It is the Sicily of the Eastern\r\nDesert. Beryl, tourmaline, actinolite, various micas, chlorite, talc\r\nand crystals of calcite are amongst the commoner minerals found. The\r\nserpentine which abounds in its upper parts is highly magnetic, and\r\nthe compass was found to be disturbed by no less than 40° near the\r\ntriangulation point. Gebel Sikait is drained from the west by the Wadi\r\nSikait, a tributary of Wadi Nugrus, and from the east by the Wadi Um\r\nGamil. The best place to climb it from is the Wadi Sikait, and the\r\nascent, not a difficult one, is rendered interesting by the ruins\r\nand old mines encountered; part of the way one passes over an ancient\r\nmade road, now broken in many places by the downwash from the hill.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Ras Um Gamil= and =Gebel Um Gamil= are two high hill ranges\r\nsouth-east of Sikait, which have only been sketched from a distance.\r\n\r\n=Madaret Um Gamil= is a conspicuous double-topped hill on the north\r\nside of the Wadi Gemal, seventeen kilometres south-east of Sikait. The\r\nbeacon which marks its highest point is in latitude 24° 34′ 52″,\r\nlongitude 34° 56′ 28″, and 454 metres above sea. It is best\r\nascended by a very winding tributary of the Wadi Gemal; this gully,\r\nup which there is a road, leads past the south-west foot of the\r\nhill, and the climb is only one of some 200 metres. The rocks round\r\nMadaret Um Gamil are mostly schists, but the top of the hill is a\r\nhard gabbro like that of Gebel Atut, weathered into rusty looking\r\nblocks. A good view seawards is obtained from the summit, some very\r\nred granite forming a conspicuous feature in the low hills between\r\nit and the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n             =The Abu Hamamid — Hamata — Abu Gurdi Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThis group of mountains is remarkable both for its extent and for\r\nthe loftiness of many of its peaks, some of which are among the\r\nhighest in Egypt. It is a mass of rugged ridges and peaks, covering\r\nabout a quarter of a square degree of the earth’s surface between\r\nlatitudes 24° 0′ and 24° 30′, in which the two dominant summits,\r\nAbu Hamamid (1,747 metres) and Hamata (1,978 metres) are the most\r\nconspicuous features in the west and east portions respectively,\r\nwhile Abu Gurdi (1,562 metres) forms the great terminal peak of a\r\nsouth-easterly extension of the mass. Plate XII shows two typical\r\nviews in this rugged region.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Hamamid= is a great ridge of hard greenish schists towering\r\nabove the surrounding mountains to a height of 1,747 metres above\r\nsea. Its crest is broken into a number of separate summits, which\r\nappear from most aspects of almost a sugar loaf form; the beacon\r\nis on the most northerly and highest of these, its position being\r\nlatitude 24° 14′ 41″, longitude 34° 47′ 38″. The mountain\r\nis best ascended from the Wadi Um Semiuki, a tributary of Huluz,\r\nwhich drains its north-east face. By ascending this wadi till camels\r\ncould go no higher owing to its increasingly rough and stony floor,\r\nI was able to pitch a camp at 865 metres above sea-level and two and\r\na quarter kilometres north-east of the summit, leaving an ascent of\r\n882 metres to be made on foot. The ascent, which occupied four hours,\r\nwas free from difficulty till within about one hundred metres of the\r\ntop, but the last portion was extremely steep and was only negotiated\r\nwith considerable trouble; it represents pretty nearly the limit of\r\npossibility in getting instruments up difficult places. Once the top\r\nwas reached, however, the magnificence of the view obtainable, and the\r\nexcellence of the point as a station for triangulating the principal\r\npeaks among the thousands visible, seemed an ample recompense for the\r\ntrouble of reaching it. The top of the ridge (_see_ Plate VII, p. 166)\r\nis very rough and narrow, only a little over a metre wide, and it is\r\ndifficult to find a spot near the summit where one can spread one’s\r\nblankets for the night with even a slight approach to comfort. The\r\neight nights of enforced bivouacking which I was obliged to spend on\r\nthe top of Abu Hamamid in February 1906, before I could complete my\r\nobservations, belong to the least pleasant of my experiences in the\r\ndesert. A little work only was possible the first day, owing to haze\r\nobscuring the more distant peaks. On the second day clouds enveloped\r\nus in a wet drizzle, and a bitterly cold north wind blew with great\r\nviolence; a rude rubble shelter which my men built on the summit,\r\ncovered with a blanket, was a very poor protection, and I found it\r\nbetter to throw a rubble embankment across a steep gully on the lee\r\nside, forming a small level platform where we were sheltered from the\r\nbiting wind. For the next five days, we were alternately wrapped in\r\nclouds or left free under a brilliant blue sky with clouds covering\r\nall the surrounding country. It was curious on these days to look over\r\nthe surface of the clouds, as over a boundless level sea, with only\r\nthe highest peaks projecting sharp and black above the white surface,\r\nand to see the sun rise and set exactly as though one were on the\r\nocean. Then at last the clouds began to disappear, and on the first\r\nclear day a very large amount of triangulation was accomplished, all\r\nthe more prominent peaks within a radius of about sixty kilometres\r\nbeing observed. Gebel Abu Hamamid forms a culminating point on the\r\nNile — Red Sea watershed, its eastern parts draining to Wadi Huluz\r\nand its western ones to Wadi Abu Hamamid, a tributary of Wadi Kharit.\r\n\r\n                                                            PLATE XII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Typical Views among the Mountains of Hamata and Abu\r\nHamamid. (The high peak in the distance in the lower view is Gebel\r\nHamata).]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Semiuki= is a sharp cone rising to 1,283 metres above the\r\nsea among a mass of lower hills three kilometres north-east of Gebel\r\nAbu Hamamid. It is of a reddish aspect, due to a film which covers\r\nthe weathered surface of the green and grey hornfels of which it is\r\ncomposed. It is drained by the Wadi Um Semiuki.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Argub= is a very conspicuous mountain, almost conical in\r\nshape, seven and a half kilometres south-south-west of Gebel Abu\r\nHamamid, from which it is separated by lower hills. To the south,\r\nGebel Abu Argub overlooks the plain of Selaia. Its peak, 1,690 metres\r\nabove sea-level, is a good landmark from the south and west.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Kahfa= is a many-peaked mountain of granite rising abruptly\r\nto a height of 1,018 metres above sea from among lower hills of dark\r\nschists, nineteen kilometres south-west of Gebel Abu Hamamid. It is\r\ndetached from the main mountain-mass, being separated from it by the\r\nheads of Wadi Um Retba. Its faces are in many places sheer precipices\r\nof several hundred metres (_see_ Plate XIII), but the ascent of it\r\nfrom the north is not very difficult. In occupying Kahfa as a station\r\nI approached it from Bir Shadli by a well-marked track which skirts\r\nthe western foot-hills and leads to the Wadi Helie. Leaving this track\r\nwhere it crosses Wadi Um Hargal some six kilometres from Bir Shadli, I\r\nascended the Wadi Um Hargal and crossed the pass at its head into the\r\nhead of Wadi Um Retba, where I pitched my camp at an altitude of 563\r\nmetres, at the foot of Gebel Kahfa 1·3 kilometres north-north-east of\r\nthe beacon on its summit. The climb of 455 metres from this camp to\r\nthe top occupied three hours. There is good bivouacking ground close\r\neast of the summit, between two ridges. The beacon which marks the\r\ntriangulation point is in latitude 24° 8′ 18″, longitude 34°\r\n38′ 55″. A walk round the top is full of interest; one can reach\r\nmany points overlooking tremendous precipices, and the forms assumed\r\nby the granite peaks are very remarkable. On the west side of the\r\nmountain is a rather large open space forming the head of Wadi Helie,\r\nbut elsewhere one is surrounded by low hills. The principal drainers\r\nof Kahfa are the Wadis Um Hargal and Um Retba (tributaries of Wadi\r\nel Sheikh) to the north, and Helie and Abu Hashim (tributaries of\r\nWadi Kharit) to the south.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Medsus= is a small group of high hills rising among lower\r\nones between Gebel Abu Hamamid and Bir Shadli.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Metawit= is a high granite hill rising conspicuously among\r\nmuch lower hills thirteen kilometres north-west of Bir Shadli. A\r\ntrack leading from Bir Shadli to Bir Metawit and other wells further\r\nnorth-west passes close east of the hill. Gebel Metawit is a good\r\nlandmark for Bir Metawit, which is situated in the wadi of the same\r\nname about three kilometres north-west of it. The summit is 741 metres\r\nabove sea-level or about 295 metres above the wadi floor at the well.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hamrat Mukbud= is a great red granite mass rising from the\r\nplain about twenty-five kilometres west of Bir Shadli. Its isolated\r\ncharacter and great altitude (892 metres above the sea and about\r\n450 metres above the surrounding country) render Hamrat Mukbud one\r\nof the finest and best known landmarks in this part of the desert. A\r\ncairn on its summit marks the triangulation point, in latitude 24°\r\n9′ 53″, longitude 34° 23′ 17″. Its ascent is a matter of\r\nsome difficulty, owing to its great steepness.\r\n\r\n=El Hamra= is another red granite mass, much smaller than Hamrat\r\nMukbud, lying about half-way between that mountain and Bir Shadli,\r\nand separating the Wadi Abu Hamamid from the Wadi el Sheikh.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Homr Akarim= is a hill about thirty-three kilometres west\r\nof Gebel Hamrat Mukbud, close to the north of Wadi el Khashab. Its\r\nsummit, 490 metres above sea, is marked by a triangulation cairn.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Marasan= is a range of mountains north-west of Abu Hamamid. It\r\nis cut through by an important pass over the main watershed, 685\r\nmetres above sea-level, connecting the Wadis Huluz and Abu Hamamid\r\nby their respective tributaries Marasan and Marasani, which drain\r\nnorth-east and south-west from the pass. The highest peak of the\r\nmountains south of the pass is 1,261 metres above sea-level, while\r\nthose to the north are lower. The name Gebel Marasan is, however,\r\ncommonly given only to the peaks north of the pass, as they rise more\r\nabruptly from it, while those to the south are unnamed or regarded\r\nas part of Gebel Hamamid because the Wadi Abu Hamamid drains their\r\nsouthern flanks.\r\n\r\n                                                           PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two Views on Gebel Kahfa. (Granite).]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Khulla= is a range lying a few kilometres west of Gebel\r\nMarasan from which it is quite separated. Its highest point is 978\r\nmetres above sea. It is drained by Wadi Khulla, a tributary of Wadi\r\nAbu Hamamid.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Sedri= is a remarkable pair of twin peaks on or near the\r\nmain watershed seventeen kilometres north-west of Gebel Abu Hamamid,\r\nand a little to the south of the Wadi Huluz. These peaks, which are\r\n970 metres above sea-level and about 460 metres above the floor of\r\nWadi Huluz, are very conspicuous from the surrounding high country,\r\nbut they cannot be seen from the Wadi Huluz itself as they lie a\r\nlittle way back from the scarps which bound the gorge. It is the\r\ndrainage from the hills round Gebel Um Sedri which feeds the water\r\nholes of Um Gerifat, in a little gorge opening to Wadi Huluz about\r\ntwo kilometres north-west of the peaks.\r\n\r\n=Gebel el Heda= is a conspicuous hill situated ten kilometres\r\nnorth-north-west of Gebel Metawit, between the Wadis Antar and\r\nKhashab. Its highest point is 862 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Nukheira= is a group of high hills on or near the main\r\nwatershed, close to the head of Wadi Antar and about ten kilometres\r\nnorth-north-west of Gebel el Heda. Its highest point is 876 metres\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Ras Abu Etl= is a lower hill seven kilometres north-east of\r\nGebel Nukheira. As seen from the upper part of the Wadi Gemal it\r\nappeared to have a flat top, which is 648 metres above the sea. It\r\nis probably drained by the short Wadi Abu Etl, which joins Wadi\r\nHuluz to form the Wadi Gemal.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Suerab= is a great high ridge of dark looking rocks,\r\nsurrounded by high flanking hills, rising conspicuously in the\r\nhilly country between the Wadis Huluz and Gemal, about twenty-four\r\nkilometres north-north-west of Gebel Abu Hamamid. The top of its\r\nridge, which appears to be nearly level for about a kilometre of its\r\nlength, is 1,024 metres above sea-level. From its neighbourhood drain\r\ntwo wadis in opposite directions; one, called the Wadi Um Suerab lil\r\nGemal, goes northward to join Wadi Gemal, while the other, called\r\nWadi Um Suerab lil Huluz, is the longer and courses southward to\r\njoin Wadi Huluz.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Durunkat= is another apparently flat-topped hill eight\r\nkilometres south-east of Gebel Um Suerab, on the west side of the\r\nWadi Durunkat, about thirteen kilometres above its junction with\r\nWadi Gemal. Its summit is 924 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abarun= is a mountain range situated a short distance\r\nnorth-east of Gebel Abu Argub, from which it is separated by the Wadi\r\nAbarun. Its highest peak, almost due east of that of Abu Argub, from\r\nwhich it is separated by the Wadi Abarun, is 1,602 metres above sea,\r\nand overlooks the great plain of Selaia to the south.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um el Tiur= is a range extending south-east from Gebel Abarun,\r\nforming a southward prolongation of the mountains. Its highest peak\r\nis 1,450 metres above the sea, while the terminal peak southward is\r\n1,080 metres. It is drained on the west by the Wadis el Shel and el\r\nAnbat (tributaries of Wadi Kharit) and on the east by the Wadi Um\r\nel Tiur (a tributary of Wadi Hilgit lil Kharit).\r\n\r\n=Gebel el Anbat= is a group of lower dark coloured hills forming\r\nthe south foot hills of Gebel Um el Tiur. Its highest point is 788\r\nmetres above sea, while a detached black hill a little west of it\r\non the plain rises to 680 metres above sea, or 175 metres above the\r\nplain at its base. These hills are drained by the Wadi el Anbat and\r\nother small feeders of Wadi Kharit.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Usher= and =Um Hasidok= are conspicuous peaks on the main\r\nwatershed ten kilometres east, and twelve and a half kilometres\r\neast-south-east respectively of Gebel Abu Hamamid, rising to 1,487\r\nand 1,497 metres above sea-level. They are drained to the south by\r\nthe Wadi Hilgit lil Kharit, and to the north by the Wadi el Mahali,\r\na feeder of Wadi Huluz.\r\n\r\n=Gebel el Mahali= is a rather high peak of grey porphyry which forms\r\na northerly extension of Gebel Um Usher, close south of the Wadi\r\nHuluz. Its top is 1,112 metres above sea, or 330 metres above the\r\nadjacent wadi floor.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hamata=, with one exception[106] the highest mountain in\r\nthe Eastern Desert of Egypt, is situated on the meridian of 35°,\r\nin latitude 24° 12′, thirty-three kilometres from the nearest\r\npoint of the coast and 213 kilometres from the nearest point of the\r\nNile, and rises to an altitude of 1,978 metres above sea-level; the\r\nsummit is marked by a triangulation beacon, the position of which is\r\nlatitude 24° 12′ 17″, longitude 35° 0′ 16″. Gebel Hamata\r\nlies some five kilometres east of the main watershed, which curiously\r\nenough is not always formed by the highest peaks. It is drained\r\nprincipally by the Wadi Huluz, the heads of which almost encircle\r\nit. The Wadi Hamata heads in the eastern face of the high ridge which\r\nconnects Gebels Hamata and Abu Ghusun, and thus only takes a small\r\nportion of the drainage of Gebel Hamata itself. Though surrounded\r\nby other high mountains, Hamata towers above them so as to be a very\r\nconspicuous feature on the sky line from great distances. Looked at\r\nfrom the north or south, it is like a great, rather flat, cone with\r\na smaller cone east of it. The best way to ascend the mountain is\r\nfrom the head of the Wadi el Abiad, that feeder of Wadi Huluz which\r\ndrains the north face of it. In proceeding up the Wadi el Abiad\r\nfrom Wadi Huluz, one is shut in by high hills on either side till\r\nabout six kilometres from the mountain; then the wadi opens into a\r\nrough plain with low granite hills, and the imposing mass of Hamata\r\nsprings suddenly into full view. My camels were coaxed on with their\r\nloads up this wadi, which becomes very steep and stony as its head\r\nis approached, to within two and a quarter kilometres of the summit,\r\nwhere they actually reached an altitude of 1,025 metres above the\r\nsea. The ascent of the remaining 953 metres on foot, though tiring,\r\nwas fairly easy, and occupied less than four hours. The lower third\r\nof Hamata is a whitish granite; this gives place higher up to a hard\r\nquartz felsite, which rings under the hammer and weathers into rusty\r\nbrown blocks. To the east of the main summit the rock changes to a\r\ngreen breccia, which seems to form a considerable portion of that\r\npart of the mountain. The view from the summit is a fine one in\r\nclear weather, including as it does an extensive prospect of the\r\nrugged mountains around, and a large extent of coast-line. But it\r\nwas on this mountain that I had my first experience of the chronic\r\nhaze which seems to hang almost perpetually over the coastal regions\r\nin the neighbourhood of the tropic, and which is the greatest enemy\r\nof the surveyor in these parts. On each of the three days which\r\nI spent on Hamata, the morning sun rose over cloud-banks to the\r\neast; clouds filled all the wadis and covered the lower country,\r\nwhile the highest peaks stood up clear and sharp above the sea\r\nof cloud. Towards 10 a.m., the clouds gradually melted away over\r\nthe land under the increasing solar influence, but there remained\r\na continuous haze, especially over the coast and out to sea. The\r\nexplanation of the almost perpetual clouds and haze was soon seen,\r\nand is very simple. If the wind blows from the north-west, it is\r\ngenerally cool or even cold in winter. If this north wind is dry\r\nand persistent, the air is clear; but should it fail and warm moist\r\nbreezes set in from seaward, these drop their moisture on reaching\r\nthe cooler air of the mountains. If the air is still or nearly so,\r\nthe moisture is evaporated in the sun’s rays during the day, only\r\nto precipitate itself again as the air cools by rapid radiation at\r\nnight. As a consequence, dews on the mountains are extremely heavy,\r\nand one soon learns to seek the shelter of an overhanging rock or to\r\nimprovise a rude tent from a blanket and a few sticks over one’s\r\nnightly resting-place.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Ghusun= is a mountain range north of Hamata, with which\r\nit is connected by a ridge of lower peaks so as to close in the\r\nsmall rough granite plain north-east of the latter mountain. Its\r\nhighest peak, eight kilometres north-north-west of Gebel Hamata,\r\nis 1,389 metres above sea-level. It is drained on the south by\r\nthe Wadi el Abiad, the same tributary of Wadi Huluz which drains\r\nthe north face of Hamata, and on the north by the Wadi Abu Ghusun,\r\nwhich enters the sea separately.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Laham= is a mass of lower hills a little west of Gebel Abu\r\nGhusun, forming the side of Wadi Huluz opposite to Gebel el Mahali.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Tarfawi= is a complex mountain range fourteen kilometres\r\nnorth-west of Gebel Hamata. Its highest point, at the north-west end\r\nof a ridge, is 1,363 metres above the sea. It is probably drained\r\nto the south by the Wadi Tarfawi, a tributary of Wadi Huluz, and to\r\nthe north by feeders of Wadi Romit.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Heshenib= is a great ridge situated twenty-two kilometres\r\nnorth-west of Gebel Hamata. The beacon on its highest point,\r\nin latitude 24° 20′ 49″, longitude 34° 50′ 53″, has an\r\naltitude of 1,135 metres above the sea. Its lower parts are granite,\r\nbut the upper third is of dark schists, while the actual ridge on\r\nwhich the beacon stands is a grey porphyrite. Gebel Um Heshenib is\r\ndrained to the north by the Wadi el Abiad, a tributary of Wadi Gemal,\r\nand to the south by tributaries of Wadi Huluz. I ascended it on two\r\noccasions from opposite sides. The north approach is the easier road\r\nfor camels, as they can pass easily up the broad and sandy Wadi el\r\nAbiad, while to reach it from Wadi Huluz one has to journey over\r\na rather stony pass and along narrow stony wadis. But the climb\r\nis longer from the north side, being one of 635 metres against 380\r\nmetres from the south, and the southern climb is easier as well as\r\nshorter. It is interesting to note that as the ground south of the\r\nmountain lies at an average level of 250 metres higher than that to\r\nthe north, the plumb-line ought from theoretical considerations to\r\nbe attracted to the south by several seconds, and this was found\r\nto be the case when the mountain was used as a latitude station\r\n(_see_ p. 47) There is a very difficult pass east of the mountain\r\nfrom the head of Wadi el Abiad into a tributary of Wadi Huluz; I\r\nwas told that loaded camels could not possibly get over the pass,\r\nand have reason to believe the statement true, as although I did\r\nnot consent my men were desirous of going over it and volunteered\r\nto carry the baggage over themselves to relieve the camels.\r\n\r\n=Gebel el Abiad= is the name given to two distinct ranges of high\r\ngranite hills on either side of the Wadi el Abiad, north and east\r\nof Gebel Um Heshenib. The eastern of these two ranges extends\r\nin a north-westerly direction for about twelve kilometres from\r\nGebel Tarfawi to near the place where Wadi el Abiad turns to the\r\nnorth-east. It has numerous peaks, of which the most conspicuous\r\nis at the south-east end of a high ridge six and a half kilometres\r\nnorth-east of Gebel Um Heshenib, and rises to 957 metres above\r\nsea. This eastern range is drained from the west by the Wadi el Abiad,\r\nand from the west by the Wadis Shoab and Romit. The western range is\r\nslightly lower and less extensive; one of its most conspicuous peaks,\r\neleven kilometres north-north-east of Um Heshenib, is 892 metres\r\nabove the sea, and there are numerous other peaks further south of\r\nalmost equal altitude. This western range is almost entirely drained\r\nby the Wadi el Abiad, a feeder of which curves round the south end of\r\nthe range, thus separating it from Gebel Um Heshenib; the drainage\r\nfrom the north end probably passes into the Wadi Mukhatatat, while\r\na portion of the eastern slopes may be drained by feeders of Wadi\r\nDurunkat. It is the coarse white granitic sand resulting from the\r\ndisintegration of the rocks of these hills which gives its name to\r\nthe Wadi el Abiad, and the hills take their name from the wadi. The\r\nheads of the wadi near Gebel Um Heshenib are, however, blackened by\r\nhornblendic downwash from the schists which overlie the granite of\r\nthat mountain.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shoab= is a very high white granite hill close to the head of\r\nWadi Shoab, on its north side. It rises to 830 metres above the sea,\r\nor about 400 metres above the wadi floor.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hefeiri= is a very sharp granite peak a little west of the\r\nWadi Abu Ghusun, about fifteen kilometres north of Hamata. Rising to\r\n612 metres above the sea, or about 300 metres above the wadi near it,\r\namong lower granite hills, it is a good landmark. There is a smaller\r\nvery sharp peak two and a half kilometres to the north-east, on the\r\nopposite side of the Wadi Abu Ghusun, while to the west are sugar\r\nloaf shaped hills.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Sueh= is a conspicuous granite hill six and a half\r\nkilometres east of the Wadi el Abiad and four and a half kilometres\r\nnorth of the Wadi Shoab, rising to 781 metres above sea. It is\r\nprobably drained from the north-east by the heads of Wadi Um el Abbas.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um el Abbas= is a very remarkable granite hill between Gebels\r\nUm Sueh and Abu Hegilig. From the north, it looks like a square block\r\nwith precipitous sides, having a sheer drop of about 200 metres. Its\r\nsummit is 697 metres above sea. It is drained by the Wadi Um el Abbas,\r\nwhich goes independently to the sea.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Hegilig= is another high granite hill, three and a half\r\nkilometres east of Gebel Um el Abbas and twenty-six kilometres north\r\nof Gebel Hamata. Its summit, 607 metres above sea, is marked by a\r\nbeacon, the position being latitude 24° 26′ 16″, longitude 34°\r\n58′ 32″. The hill is drained by feeders of Wadi Um el Abbas. The\r\ncamp from which I ascended the hill was in one of these feeders 1,200\r\nmetres north-east of the beacon and 267 metres above sea-level; the\r\nclimb of 340 metres was not difficult, and only occupied a little\r\nover an hour. The beacon is on a block not large enough to take an\r\ninstrument, so that observations here were taken from an eccentric\r\npoint a little way along the ridge and afterwards reduced to centre.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Sarobi= is a small hill-range twenty-two kilometres north-east\r\nof Gebel Hamata and some eleven kilometres from the sea coast. The\r\npeak at its south end is 471 metres above sea-level. This range\r\nhas not been closely approached nor well seen, but it must be very\r\nconspicuous to any one travelling in the low hill country near\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Ras el Kharit= is a mountain range forming part of the main\r\nwatershed, running in a nearly east and west line a little south\r\nof Gebel Hamata. Its highest peak is extremely sharp, and rises\r\nto 1,661 metres above sea-level six kilometres south-south-east of\r\nHamata. Of the many other peaks of the range, the chief is one three\r\nkilometres west of the highest point, and six kilometres due south\r\nof Hamata; this reaches an altitude of 1,564 metres. The northern\r\nface of the range is drained by the heads of the Wadi Huluz, while\r\nthe southern is drained by the heads of Wadi Kharit, whence the name\r\nof the mountain range.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Khashir=, which forms an eastward extension of Gebel Ras\r\nel Kharit, reaches an altitude of 1,565 metres above sea-level;\r\nits highest peak is nine and a half kilometres south-east of Gebel\r\nHamata. It is drained to the sea by the Wadi Khashir, the heads of\r\nwhich end in the precipitous eastern faces of the mountain.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Mikbi= is a long high ridge on the main watershed, seven\r\nkilometres south of Gebel Khashir. Its highest point, at the south\r\nend of the ridge, is 1,388 metres above sea-level. Gebel Mikbi\r\nis connected with Gebel Ras el Kharit by a lower ridge running\r\nnorth-west and forming the continuation of the watershed across the\r\nhead of Wadi el Kharit. There is a pass across this ridge into the\r\nhead of Wadi Mikbi, which drains Gebel Mikbi seawards, but it is a\r\nvery difficult one for loaded camels owing to the great steepness\r\nof the eastern side.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Zatit= is another high ridge about five kilometres east of\r\nGebel Mikbi, on the south side of the head of Wadi Mikbi.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Egat= is a high mountain close to the south-west of Gebel\r\nMikbi, forming the continuation of the watershed. It has two principal\r\npeaks, two and a quarter kilometres apart, of which the south-west\r\none is the higher, being 1,422 metres, while the north-east one is\r\n1,277 metres above the sea. The western face of the mass is drained\r\nby the Wadi Egat, a tributary of Kharit, while the eastern flanks\r\nare cut up by feeders of the Wadi Sefent, a tributary of Wadi Lahami.\r\n\r\n=Gebels Um Sellim= and =Gumudlum= are high hill ranges forming an\r\neastward extension of the Egat and Mikbi mountains, on the north side\r\nof Wadis Sefent and Lahami. The highest point of Gebel Um Sellim is\r\n947 metres above sea, or about 620 metres above the floor of Wadi\r\nLahami. These ranges are flanked by lower hills through which run\r\nvarious small wadis such as Um Khuzuma, Um Ghobasha, and Gumudlum,\r\nall feeders of Wadi Lahami. Some of these small wadis contain rock\r\nbasins or galts which retain large supplies of water for some time\r\nafter rain has fallen on the hills.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Gurdi= is a great mountain in latitude 24° 0′, forming\r\nthe terminal peak to the south of the Hamata group. The beacon on\r\nits summit, in latitude 24° 0′ 11″, longitude 35° 5′ 17″,\r\nis 1,562 metres above sea-level. Though in reality a ridge, Abu Gurdi\r\nfrom most points of view looks like a rather flat cone, surrounded\r\nby lower hills. It is on the main watershed, which crossing to the\r\nsummit from Gebel Egat, continues south-eastward along a narrow ridge\r\ndescending to the pass at the head of Wadi Lahami. The south-west\r\nparts of Abu Gurdi are drained by the Wadis Abu Gurdi and Elemikan,\r\nboth tributaries of Kharit, while its southern and eastern parts\r\ndrain into Wadi Lahami by various feeders, of which the chief are the\r\nWadis Um Karaba, Um Rishan, Um Homar, and Sefent. Gebel Abu Gurdi\r\ncould probably be ascended from the west by following up the Wadi\r\nAbu Gurdi, but in occupying the mountain as a triangulation station\r\nI descended the Wadi Lahami as far as the point of influx of Wadi Um\r\nKaraba and then ascended the latter wadi as far as the camels could\r\nget, pitching my camp two kilometres south of the summit at 804 metres\r\nabove sea-level. The ascent of 758 metres to the beacon on foot from\r\nthe camp occupied two and a quarter hours of fairly stiff climbing;\r\nit presented no serious difficulties, but the rock near the top is\r\nmuch broken up and one has to be careful lest blocks are dislodged\r\nunder one’s foot. The view from the top of Abu Gurdi on a clear day\r\nmust be extremely fine, but during the three days I remained there\r\na thin haze spoiled the distant prospect, especially towards the\r\ncoast; the remarkable shapes of the granite peaks of Gebel Faraid,\r\nsixty kilometres to the south-south-east, formed the most striking\r\nfeature in the scene.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Derhib=, 1,160 metres above the sea, is a mountain separating\r\nWadi Abu Gurdi from Wadi Egat; it is really an extension of Gebel\r\nAbu Gurdi, from the beacon on which its summit is six and a half\r\nkilometres west.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Goradi= is likewise in reality part of the Abu Gurdi mass,\r\nforming the end of a spur extending south-eastward for ten kilometres\r\nfrom the main peak. The Wadi Lahami curves round its foot northward,\r\npassing between it and Gebel Um Gunud.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Selaia=[107] (the bald head) is a very remarkable\r\nrounded granite boss rising from the plain thirty-one kilometres\r\nsouth-south-west of Gebel Hamata. Owing to its peculiar shape,\r\nisolated position, and considerable height (its top is 787 metres\r\nabove sea-level and about 260 metres above the plain), Selaia\r\nis a conspicuous landmark for great distances round it. The lower\r\nillustration on Plate XI (p. 172) gives an idea of its appearance as\r\nseen from the east; from the north or south it appears much steeper.\r\n\r\nSouth-east of Gebel Selaia stretches a line of four smaller granite\r\nhills. The first of these, about a kilometre from the great boss,\r\nis interesting as having a small spring, called Megal el Selaia,\r\nat its foot. The next, one and a half kilometres further on,\r\nis larger, while the third is larger still, rising to 623 metres\r\nabove sea-level. The fourth, five kilometres from Gebel Selaia,\r\nis marked by a triangulation beacon, 563 metres above sea-level and\r\nabout fifty metres above the plain, in latitude 23° 55′ 30″,\r\nlongitude 34° 54′ 37″.\r\n\r\n=Gebel el Homur= is an isolated mass of granite hills on the plain\r\nsix kilometres north-east of Selaia. Its highest point is 731 metres\r\nabove sea and 230 metres above the plain at its foot. It is drained\r\nby small feeders of the Wadi Abu Gurdi, which passes north of the\r\nmass on its way across the plain to join Wadi Kharit.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Derega= is an isolated mass of higher granite hills\r\nthirteen kilometres south-east of Gebel Selaia. Its highest point\r\nis 831 metres above sea-level, and about 300 metres above the\r\nplain. Gebel Abu Derega is on the Nile — Red Sea watershed, which\r\ncrosses the plain from east to west in this locality. The northern\r\ndrainage is to the Wadi Elemikan, which runs between Gebels Abu\r\nDerega and Selaia to join Wadi Kharit, while the southern faces of\r\nthe hills are drained by feeders of the Wadi el Khiua, a tributary\r\nof Wadi Um Bisilla, in the basin of Wadi Hodein.\r\n\r\nBesides the hills above described, there are many smaller ones\r\nscattered at intervals over the great sandy plain of Selaia,\r\nbut the only others calling for special notice are the three\r\nvery remarkable white conical hills called =Marwot Elemikan=,\r\nsituated twelve kilometres east of Abu Derega. These hills, though\r\nsmall, are conspicuous from considerable distances, owing to the\r\ndazzling appearance of the pure milk-white quartz of which they are\r\ncomposed. The highest and most northerly one, with a triangulation\r\nbeacon on its summit, rises to 648 metres above sea, or 68 metres\r\nabove the plain, in latitude 23° 54′ 14″, longitude 35° 6′\r\n8″. The other two lie about two kilometres south-east and south\r\nrespectively, with a black hill mid-way between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n               =The Um Gunud — Dahanib — Batoga Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains of this group, occupying the country east of the\r\nwatershed between Wadi Lahami and Wadi Khoda, are considerably lower\r\nthan those of the preceding two groups, only a few peaks rising\r\nmore than 1,000 metres above sea. The north portion of the group\r\nis formed by the line of mountain ridges which as seen from the\r\nsea near Berenice appears to connect Gebel Kalalat with Abu Gurdi,\r\nwhile the south part spreads further east and west and contains the\r\nhighest peaks.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Gunud= is the northernmost mountain of the range west\r\nof Berenice. It is a dark rugged ridge, surmounted by a cairn[108]\r\n989 metres above sea-level, forming the east side of the Wadi Lahami\r\nopposite Gebel Abu Gurdi. It is drained from the west by the Wadi Um\r\nGunud, a feeder of Wadi Lahami, and on the east by feeders of Wadi\r\nNaait. Gullies in the west flanks of the mountain contain rock basins,\r\ncalled Galt Um Gunud, which hold water supplies for a long time after\r\nrain has fallen, and which are fairly easy of access from Wadi Lahami.\r\n\r\nGebel Eidab, the next member of the range to the south, rises to\r\n848 metres above sea. It is drained on the west by the Wadi Eidab,\r\na tributary of Wadi Lahami, and on the east by the Wadi Abu Daba, a\r\ntributary of Wadi Mukhit; a rough and steep pass is said to exist from\r\neast to west between the heads of these two wadis near the mountain.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Maiat=, a long high ridge stretching south-east from Gebel\r\nEidab, has three marked summits near its ends and centre; that at the\r\nnorth end, which is the highest, is 928 metres, while the other two\r\nare 870 and 842 metres above sea respectively. Another broken ridge,\r\nof similar height, for which I could get no name from my guides,\r\nforms a south-eastern prolongation of Um Maiat, and extends to\r\nthe Wadi Kalalat; this likewise has three well defined summits,\r\nrising in order from north to south, to 875, 821, and 627 metres\r\nrespectively. These ridges are drained to the east by the Wadis\r\nMurra (tributary of Abu Daba) and Mindeit. Their western drainage\r\nhas not been studied in detail, but it all reaches the sea, none of\r\nit going Nilewards; part of the drainage is probably taken by each\r\nof the Wadis Kalalat, Shut, and El Khiua.\r\n\r\nTo the east and north-east of the Um Gunud — Eidab — Um Maiat\r\nrange is a great expanse of lower hill country through which the\r\nwadis cut their way eastwards for about fifteen kilometres to the\r\ncoast plain. The most conspicuous peaks in this lower hill country\r\nare Gebels Um Huk, Abu Ghalqa, and Um Hegilig, all situated in its\r\nnorth portion round about Wadis Lahami and Naait. Other low rugged\r\nhills fill a triangular tract south-west of the main range.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Huk= is a sharp granite peak, surmounted by a cairn,[109]\r\nrising to 517 metres above sea-level near the south side of Wadi\r\nLahami, fourteen kilometres north-north-east of Gebel Um Gunud.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Ghalqa= is another high granite hill, also marked by a\r\ncairn on its summit, seven kilometres south-south-east of Um Huk. The\r\ncairn is 561 metres above sea-level, and is in latitude 24° 1′\r\n7″, longitude 35° 16′ 47″.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Hegilig= in a small rather spiky range of red granite\r\nhills situated a little to the north-east of Gebel Um Gunud, near\r\nthe heads of Wadi Naait.\r\n\r\nTo the north-west of Berenice are several low hills on the coast\r\nplain, which serve as landmarks and bear special names. =Grain el\r\nRih= is a conspicuous isolated low hill nearly opposite the place\r\nwhere Wadi Naait emerges from the hills on to the plain, thirteen\r\nand a half kilometres north-west of Berenice. =Khasheib Abu Daba=\r\nis the name of some low bouldery granite hills at the place where\r\nWadi Abu Daba enters the plain. =Sikeit=, a landmark for Berenice,\r\nfrom which it lies five kilometres north-west, is a low granite hill,\r\nisolated on the plain and very conspicuous; its summit is seventy\r\nmetres above sea-level, or thirty-eight metres above the plain at\r\nits foot.\r\n\r\nThe =Hills on the Peninsula of Ras Benas= are sharply marked off\r\ninto two portions by differences of colour. The most striking are the\r\ndazzling white hills of gypseous limestone which form a narrow sinuous\r\nbroken plateau nearly along the long axis of the peninsula. The\r\nhighest points of these white hills are 188 metres above the sea. Deep\r\nravines cut up the plateau and separate it into more or less detached\r\nhills. The surface of the gypseous rock is very rough, and frequently\r\nweathered into knife-like projections which cut one’s hands and\r\nboots badly in climbing. Near the tip of the peninsula the gypseous\r\nbeds contain a little sulphur in places, and there are some shallow\r\npits which seem to have been dug for exploiting that mineral. But\r\nthe quantity appears far too small to be of any commercial value,\r\nand the pits were probably only exploratory trial holes.\r\n\r\nThe other hills on the peninsula are darker in colour, being chiefly\r\ndiorite. They form two masses, one near to where the peninsula joins\r\nthe main land, and the other on the south side of the peninsula twenty\r\nkilometres east of Berenice. The highest point of the first-named\r\ngroup is 276 metres, while that of the second is 197 metres, above\r\nsea-level. All the hills on the peninsula are quite separated from\r\nthose of the main land by the broad sandy plain through which Wadi\r\nMukhit courses south-eastwards to the sea.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Batoga=, a granite mountain fifteen kilometres south-east\r\nof Berenice, is sharply marked off from the other mountains near\r\nit by its light colour. It is a great boss of acid granite seamed\r\nwith dykes, having two main peaks. The highest (central) peak rises\r\nto 802 metres above sea-level; the southern peak, surmounted by a\r\ntriangulation beacon in latitude 23° 49′ 37″, longitude 35°\r\n21′ 9″, is seventeen metres lower. Gebel Batoga is drained\r\nfrom the north by feeders of the Wadi Kalalat, and from the south\r\nby the Wadi Kunserob. There is a good water source, Galt Batoga,\r\nat its north-east foot, consisting of a rock basin which holds a\r\ngood supply of water for a long time after rain, situated in a small\r\ngully close to the Wadi Kalalat, the floor of which is here about\r\n160 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Kalalat=, situated about six kilometres west of Gebel Batoga,\r\nis a mass of ridges, higher and darker in colour than Batoga. Its\r\nhighest point, marked by a beacon in latitude 23° 49′ 9″,\r\nlongitude 35° 17′ 36″, is 1,125 metres above the sea, while\r\nanother conspicuous peak one and a half kilometres north-east\r\nof the beacon, rises to 1,080 metres, and there is a third peak\r\nthree and a half kilometres south-east of the beacon which attains\r\n894 metres. In ascending Gebel Kalalat to occupy the triangulation\r\nstation, I followed up the Wadi Kalalat to where the little winding\r\nWadi Um Maiat enters it from the south, then turned up the latter wadi\r\nand pitched my camp as far up as the camels could go. The camp was\r\nthree kilometres north-east of the beacon and 300 metres above sea,\r\nso that the climb to be made on foot was 825 metres. Though long\r\nand tiring, the ascent to the beacon was not dangerous. Further up\r\nthe head of the wadi than my camp, I came on a line of galts (rock\r\nbasins) containing rain water, but they were not easy of access\r\nto camels, being in a steep and stony gorge. Perched on the east\r\nflank of Kalalat is a very remarkable pinnacle rock, well seen in\r\nthe illustration on Plate XIV. A very good view of the surrounding\r\nmountains is obtained from the summit in clear weather, but the top\r\nwas wrapped in clouds for a great part of two out of the four days I\r\nremained on it. Gebel Kalalat is drained from the north by feeders\r\nof the Wadi Kalalat, and from the south by the Wadis Gumudlum and\r\nKunserob. Wadi Kalalat curves round the north-west side of the mass,\r\nand it is possible that the ascent might be easier by following\r\nthat wadi as far as possible and climbing up the north-west face of\r\nthe mountain. A rough steep pass, impracticable for loaded camels,\r\nis said to lead from the head of Wadi Kalalat into Wadi Shut.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Dibag= is a high dark ridge five kilometres south of Gebel\r\nBatoga, with a peak at each end. The north-west peak is 517 metres,\r\nand the south-east one 544 metres above sea-level. The Wadi Kunserob\r\ncurves round its east and south flanks, while the Wadi Dibag lil\r\nKunserob drains its eastern face into the same channel.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shenshef= is a mass of high dark hills between the Wadis\r\nShenshef and Gumudlum, close to the Wadi Khoda. On one of its eastern\r\npeaks, situated in latitude 23° 44′ 5″, longitude 35° 22′\r\n40″, on the west side of Wadi Shenshef, and not so high as others\r\nfurther west, a beacon has been erected overlooking the ruins called\r\nHitan Shenshef. There are wells in the wadi a short distance below\r\nthis hill. The beacon is 290 metres above the sea and 115 metres\r\nabove the wadi floor at its foot.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Dahanib= is a mountain of dark coloured rocks (diorite and\r\ngabbro), situated twelve and half kilometres south-east of Gebel\r\nKalalat and eleven kilometres north of the Wadi Khoda. Its summit,\r\non which is a triangulation beacon, is in latitude 23° 45′ 44″,\r\nlongitude 35″ 11′ 10″, and 1,270 metres above sea-level. Gebel\r\nDahanib is surrounded by other mountains and hills, and access to it\r\nis not very easy. In order to reach it from Gebel Kalalat I had to\r\nmake a journey down the Wadi Kalalat, along the coast-plain and up the\r\nWadis Khoda and Allawi, a total distance of over eighty kilometres,\r\nalthough the direct distance between the two peaks is only twelve and\r\na half kilometres. By ascending one of the heads of the Wadi Allawi\r\nuntil camels could get no further, I was able to pitch a camp 540\r\nmetres above sea-level and three kilometres south-west of the beacon,\r\nleaving 730 metres to be climbed on foot. The ascent, though tiring,\r\nwas free from difficulties or dangers, and occupied two and a half\r\nhours. A galt, containing only a small supply of water at the time\r\nof my visit, exists a little further up the head of the wadi than\r\nwhere I fixed my camp. There is a good view from the summit, but in\r\nthe winter months Dahanib, like all the mountains near the coast,\r\nis frequently wrapped in clouds for days together. Of seven days\r\nspent on the summit in February 1907, three were passed entirely in\r\nclouds, while only portions of the other four were free from fog\r\nor haze. It was on Gebel Dahanib that I first noticed the curious\r\nelectric phenomena which may be observed at high stations when\r\nelectrified clouds are passing close overhead, my attention being\r\nfirst drawn to them by a spark from the eye-piece of my theodolite\r\nstriking me over the eye. At the same moment a rapid succession\r\nof sparks a centimetre or so long passed between my hand and the\r\nadjusting screws of the instrument, while both the theodolite and\r\nmy hair hissed loudly. In this and all other cases of a like kind,\r\nI judged it best to suspend operations for a time and descend a\r\nlittle below the summit till the cloud had passed over.\r\n\r\nGebel Dahanib is drained by the Wadis Allawi, Um Tawil, and Shut, all\r\ntributaries of Wadi Khoda, which course for a considerable distance\r\nthrough the surrounding hills before reaching the main trunk wadi.\r\n\r\n                                                            PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gebel Kalalat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Summit of Gebel Faraid. (Granite).]\r\n\r\nGebels Um Hegilig, Reyan, and Shut, are high hills situated between\r\nthe Wadis Shut and Gumudlum, both tributaries of Khoda. =Gebel Um\r\nHegilig=, a dark peak rising to 966 metres above sea-level, is almost\r\nexactly midway between Gebels Dahanib and Kalalat. =Gebel Reyan=,\r\na little further south-east, is a group of peaks and ridges of which\r\nthe highest point is 863 metres above sea. =Gebel Shut=, the most\r\nremarkable of the three, is a great cone rising to 930 metres above\r\nsea, about five kilometres north of the Wadi Khoda. A very large galt\r\nis said to exist among these hills, approachable from Wadi Shut;\r\nit is probably in one of the feeders draining westward from Gebel\r\nReyan, which name signifies “the wet mountain.”\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Bisilla= is a dark mountain of gabbro rising conspicuously\r\namong lower hills twenty-two kilometres west of Gebel Dahanib. The\r\ntriangulation beacon on its summit is in latitude 23° 45′ 34″,\r\nlongitude 34° 57′ 39″, and 824 metres above sea-level. Gebel Um\r\nBisilla is drained by Wadi Um Bisilla, the head of which encircles its\r\nsouthern half, while the northern flanks are drained by feeders of\r\nthe Wadi el Khiua, which courses south-west to join Wadi Um Bisilla\r\nabout ten kilometres west of the mountain. There is an easy passage\r\nfor camels round the east side of the mountain from the head of Wadi\r\nUm Bisilla into a feeder of Wadi Abu Nilih, a tributary of Wadi El\r\nKhiua. In ascending the mountain I pitched my camp in one of the\r\ngullies draining from it to Wadi Um Bisilla, at an altitude of 513\r\nmetres above sea and 1,300 metres south-east of the beacon. The climb\r\nof 311 metres from this camp to the summit presented no difficulties,\r\nand occupied only an hour and a half.\r\n\r\n=Erf el Gimal= is a high dark ridge surrounded by lower hills ten\r\nkilometres west-south-west of Gebel Um Bisilla. Its highest point,\r\nthe west end of the ridge, is 673 metres above sea. About seven\r\nkilometres further west is a conspicuous conical hill called =Gebel\r\nAbu Shigelat=.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Zergat Naam=, sometimes called =Hagar el Fil=, is a mountain\r\nmass on the main watershed thirty kilometres west of Gebel Um\r\nBisilla. It forms a curved range round the head of the Wadi el Kreim,\r\na tributary of Garara. Its northern part is drained partly by the Wadi\r\nAbu Had, a feeder of the Rod el Kharuf, and partly by the heads of\r\nthe Wadi el Fil, which is itself the head of Wadi Naam. The highest\r\npeak of the range is a conical one near its south end, 845 metres\r\nabove sea-level, but the northern peaks are more conspicuous from\r\nsome points of view, and it is on the highest of these, 823 metres\r\nabove sea, in latitude 23° 45′ 28″, longitude 34° 40′ 34″,\r\nthat the triangulation beacon has been erected. My camp at the\r\nbase was in one of the heads of Wadi el Fil, 527 metres above the\r\nsea, and about 700 metres north-east of the beacon. The ascent from\r\nhere on foot to the beacon was fairly easy. Zergat Naam is a mass of\r\nsyenite rising through schists, but the northern summits are formed by\r\neast and west bands of a very hard quartz felsite. From the summit,\r\nlooking northwards one sees long lines of north-and-south felsite\r\ndykes forming ridges on either side of the head of Rod el Kharuf,\r\nwhile close south of one is the enclosed sloping plain across which\r\nrun the feeders of Wadi el Kreim. To the south-south-east, a range\r\nof lower hills runs north-westward from the end of the main range,\r\nand between the two there appears to be a remarkably sudden drop into\r\nthe head of Wadi Abu Seyal. The Arabs state that there is a very\r\nlarge galt at this point, reached by ascending the Wadi Abu Seyal;\r\nthe galt is said to hold water for five months after rain. But during\r\nmy occupation of the station recent rains had filled other smaller\r\nrock basins in the gullies to the north, and it was unnecessary to\r\nsend far from the camp to get supplies. It is interesting to observe\r\nfrom the summit of Zergat Naam the disposition of the rocks forming\r\nthe lower hills to the south and west; these are of sandstones with\r\nmarked dips, the area being one of much disturbance by faulting\r\nalong the Wadi el Kreim.\r\n\r\nOn the great sandy plain to the north and north-east of Zergat Naam\r\nare two extensive groups of low hills, which stand out remarkably\r\nowing to their dark colour. One of these groups, twenty kilometres\r\nnorth of Zergat Naam, is called =Gebel Geneina Gharbi=; it is\r\na mass of hills composed chiefly of dioritic and gabbroid rocks\r\n(through there are some schists and granites intermingled) and is\r\ndrained northward by the Rod el Geneina, a feeder of Wadi Kharit. The\r\nother group, called =Gebel Geneina Sharqi=, is smaller and situated\r\nfifteen kilometres further east; I did not visit it, but from its\r\ndark colour it is probable that it consists of similar rocks to those\r\nabove-mentioned. The hills of both groups rise to about 550 metres\r\nabove the sea, or about eighty to one hundred metres above the plain.\r\n\r\nIn the low country to the west of Zergat Naam, between the Wadi\r\nGarara and the Rod el Kharuf, the most conspicuous hills are =Erf\r\nel Dubeis=, a ridge twenty-six kilometres due west of the beacon,\r\n=Gebel el Nikeiba=, a granite hill marked by a triangulation cairn,\r\n570 metres above sea-level and thirty-four kilometres west-north-west\r\nof Zergat Naam; =Gebel Felieiti=, a sandstone hill, also marked by\r\na triangulation cairn, 500 metres above sea and sixteen kilometres\r\nsouth-west of Gebel Nikeiba; =Erf Abu Homur=, a ridge at the head of\r\nWadi Abu Homur (a tributary of Garara), about seven kilometres north\r\nof Gebel Felieiti; =Erf el Mohaib=, marked by a triangulation cairn\r\n465 metres above sea-level, about nine kilometres north-west of the\r\nlast-named hill; and =Gebel el Ghar=, a hill on the south side of\r\nWadi el Kharit, close to the point where the Rod el Kharuf enters it.\r\n\r\n\r\n               =The Abu Dahr — Orga — Um Tenedba Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains of this group occupy the tract between the Wadi Naam\r\nand Gebel Faraid, and are limited on the south by the Wadi Hodein.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Dahr=, the highest mountain of the group, is a great\r\nmass of serpentine, situated in latitude 23° 35′ and about forty\r\nkilometres from the coast. Its summit, marked by a triangulation\r\nbeacon in latitude 23° 36′ 8″, longitude 35° 5′ 46″, is\r\n1,131 metres above sea-level. Its western face is drained by the heads\r\nof Wadi Betan, its north-east flanks by those of Wadi Khoda, and its\r\nsouth-east parts by feeders of Wadi Rahaba. Abu Dahr is surrounded\r\nby high hills except on the west, where there is low hilly country\r\ncontaining the wells of Betan and the old mining ruins of Um Eleiga\r\n(_see_ Plate IV, p. 30). The mountain can be most easily reached\r\neither by following up the Wadi Betan to its head, or by ascending\r\nthe Wadi Salib el Azrak (a tributary of Wadi Khoda) and its feeder\r\nthe Wadi Um Karaba. There is an easy pass 1,800 metres north of the\r\nbeacon, between the central mass of Abu Dahr and the high hills north\r\nof it, connecting the heads of Wadi Betan and Wadi Um Karaba. A\r\nshort distance to the south-west of this pass there is a galt in\r\na spur of the mountain which holds water for some time after rain,\r\nand which furnished supplies during my stay at the place in 1907. In\r\noccupying the triangulation station, I fixed my camp in a small stony\r\nwadi draining from the north of the mountain, on the east side of\r\nthe pass just referred to; the camp was 600 metres above sea-level\r\nand 1,200 metres north-north-east of the beacon. The ascent, which\r\noccupied three hours, was rather difficult and dangerous, the mountain\r\nbeing not only steep[110] but composed of rotten highly crushed rock\r\nwhich came away in tons at a mere touch. There is a very extensive\r\nview from the summit, the striking peaks of Faraid being a marked\r\nfeature to the east and south-east, while to the south are the great\r\nmasses of Mishbih, Niqrub and Gerf, with the sandstone plateaux of\r\nDif, Hodein and Abraq limiting the view to the south-west. The rock\r\nof Gebel Abu Dahr is highly magnetic, and several pieces which I\r\nexamined showed strong polarity. The compass needle points in all\r\nsorts of directions as one moves about the mountain.\r\n\r\nGebel Abu Dahr and the high hills round it, especially to the south,\r\nform an important rain-collecting area, the drainage from which feeds,\r\nwholly or in part, the wells of Betan, Rahaba, Abu Reye, Abu Beid, and\r\nGahlia, all of which are within a radius of about fifteen kilometres\r\nof the summit of the mountain. The relative abundance of water in\r\nthis area is caused by two main factors. In the first place, the\r\nsituation of the mountain on the eastward side of the watershed, only\r\nabout forty kilometres from the coast, and its considerable height,\r\ncondition the frequent accumulation of clouds about its summit, with\r\nrelatively high rainfall as a consequence. And in the second place,\r\nthe steepness of the slopes, and the fact that the serpentine rocks\r\nare not only of an impermeable nature, but are so crushed that the\r\ndownwash into the gullies around is chiefly composed of smooth faced\r\nblocks rather than of absorbent sand, condition a higher ratio of run\r\noff to rainfall than exists in the case of most other localities in\r\nthe Eastern Desert. A similar state of things is found in the case\r\nof Gebel Gerf, which, as will be mentioned further on, likewise\r\nconsists of serpentine and is the centre of a district relatively\r\nrich in good wells; while in the case of the mountains of Faraid,\r\nwhich are much higher and closer to the sea, but consist of granite\r\nweathering into sand, though the rainfall is probably greater, the\r\nabsorption by the sand is so rapid that there are no wells known to\r\nexist in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBetween Gebel Abu Dahr and Gebel Um Bisilla there are three remarkable\r\nlittle groups of granite hills. =Gebel Abu Arta= is a small range\r\nof red peaks six kilometres south of Um Bisilla; =Gebel Hendusi=,\r\nfive kilometres further south, is a very conspicuous sharp granite\r\npeak rising to 678 metres above the sea and forming a good landmark;\r\nwhile =Gebel Abu Husenat=, four kilometres east of Hendusi, has\r\nanother well-marked peak rising to 725 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Sieiyil= is a many-peaked hill range running north and\r\nsouth for about four kilometres, situated eight kilometres west\r\nof the beacon on Gebel Abu Dahr. It has the appearance of being\r\ncomposed of a pink gneiss, but has not been visited. Its central\r\npeak, fixed by triangulation, is 833 metres above sea. The Wadi Abu\r\nBeid el Azrak runs south-westward past the south end of the range,\r\nthrough a gap between it and a smaller hill range to the east.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Arais= is a considerable range of gneiss peaks situated on\r\nthe east side of Wadi Naam in latitude 23° 34′. One of the most\r\nconspicuous of its many summits is a pair of twin peaks near the\r\nsouth end of the range, rising to 613 metres above the sea. The\r\nrange is cut through from east to west by the narrow and winding\r\nWadi Arais, a tributary of Wadi Naam. The drainage from the western\r\nfaces of the range passes by many feeders over a sandy plain to join\r\nthe Wadi Naam directly.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Belamhandeit= or =Erf Um Araka= is a long range of granite or\r\ngneiss hills north of Gebel Arais. It extends for a length of nine\r\nkilometres in a north-and-south direction on the meridian of 34°\r\n50′. It is drained on the north and west by the Wadi Erf Um Araka,\r\na tributary of Wadi Naam, and on the east by the Wadi Belamhandeit,\r\na tributary of Wadi Arais.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Gebel Belamhandeit are several granite bosses, of\r\nwhich the most conspicuous is called =Gebel Um Guruf=; it is drained\r\nby the Wadi Um Guruf, a tributary of Wadi Arais.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Orga=, eighteen kilometres south by east from Gebel Abu\r\nDahr, is a high dark-looking range which has not been closely\r\napproached. Its highest peak, surmounted by a beacon, the position\r\nof which has been fixed by triangulation, as latitude 23° 26′\r\n21″, longitude 35° 8′ 17″, is 682 metres above sea-level. It\r\nis drained by the Wadi Orga (a tributary of Wadi Hodein), which\r\ncontains the well called Bir Orga.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Tenedba= is a mass of dark hills of crushed basic rocks\r\nsituated thirty kilometres south by east from Gebel Abu Dahr and\r\ntwelve kilometres north of the Wadi Hodein. Its highest point,\r\nmarked by a triangulation beacon, is in latitude 23° 19′ 48″,\r\nlongitude 35° 10′ 40″, and 654 metres above sea-level. It is\r\ndrained by the Wadi Um Tenedba, a tributary of Wadi Hodein. The\r\nascent of the hill is conveniently made in about an hour from a camp\r\nin one of the heads of Wadi Um Tenedba, about 1,200 metres south-east\r\nof the beacon and 320 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Harhagit= is an isolated granite boss rising among schists ten\r\nkilometres south-south-east from Gebel Um Tenedba and five kilometres\r\nnorth of the Wadi Hodein. The beacon on its summit is in latitude\r\n23° 14′ 35″, longitude 35° 12′ 52″, at an altitude of 542\r\nmetres above sea-level, or 326 metres above the wadi encircling its\r\nbase. From its isolated character Gebel Harhagit is a conspicuous\r\nlandmark for considerable distances round the Wadi Hodein.\r\n\r\n=Gebel el Anbat= is conveniently considered here, though it lies\r\non the south side of the Wadi Hodein. It presents a somewhat\r\nsimilar appearance to Gebel Harhagit, from which it lies nineteen\r\nkilometres south-east, and like it bears a beacon on its summit. The\r\nposition of the beacon is latitude 23° 6′ 5″, longitude 35°\r\n19′ 27″. El Anbat is lower than Harhagit, being only 390 metres\r\nabove sea-level; it consists also of a different rock, being chiefly\r\ncomposed of curious brown and reddish calcareous schists. Gebel el\r\nAnbat is practically in the Wadi Hodein, the main channel of which is\r\ndeviated by its foot-hills so as to pass round the east side of the\r\nhill. It is best ascended from the south, where a camp can be fixed\r\nabout 600 metres south of the beacon and about 255 metres below it;\r\nthe ascent is easy and occupies less than an hour.\r\n\r\nEastward of Gebel Abu Dahr there extends for some thirty kilometres\r\nalong the south side of Wadi Khoda a mountainous tract of dark rocks,\r\nthe principal masses of which, from west to east, bear the names\r\nof Gebel Hindia, Gebel Um Akra, and Gebel Um Etli. These mountains\r\nhave only been seen from a distance, and little is known about\r\nthem beyond the positions and altitudes of their principal peaks,\r\nwhich have been fixed by triangulation. =Gebel Hindia=, thirteen\r\nkilometres east of Abu Dahr, rises to 873 metres above sea-level,\r\nand is drained partly by the Wadi Hindia to the north, and partly\r\nby the Wadi Salib el Azrak. =Gebel Um Akra=, six kilometres further\r\neast, is higher, its highest peak, marked by a beacon, being 1,050\r\nmetres above the sea, while a ridge a little further south reaches\r\n970 metres; it is drained to Wadi Khoda by the Wadi Um Akra. =Gebel\r\nUm Etli=, which forms the south side of the Wadi Khoda just before\r\nthat wadi emerges on to the coast-plain, has three main summits,\r\nreaching respectively to 844, 795, and 764 metres above the sea. It\r\nis a rather extensive mass, drained on the north by the Wadis Buluk\r\nand Um Lassaf, tributaries of Wadi Khoda, and on the south by the\r\nWadi Um Etli, which reaches the sea independently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =The Faraid Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains of this group cover a tract about forty kilometres in\r\nlength from north to south, between the Wadis Um Etli and Rahaba and\r\nlie closer to the sea than any other mountains in the area described,\r\ntheir peaks being only ten to twelve kilometres from the coast. They\r\nconsist entirely of granite, weathered into a forest of peaks the\r\nforms of which render them in respect of shape the most remarkable\r\nmountains in Egypt. There are four main masses in the group,\r\nof which the three northern ones are called collectively Faraid,\r\nwhile the southern one, which is smaller than, and separated from,\r\nthe rest, is called by the diminutive name Fereyid.\r\n\r\nThe most northern mass of =Gebel Faraid= is the highest, its principal\r\npeak, situated in latitude 23° 33′ 7″, longitude 35° 22′\r\n10″, being 1,366 metres above sea-level. As seen from the north,\r\nthis mass appears somewhat like an outspread hand, its western peak\r\nseeming to overhang slightly like a thumb, while the higher eastern\r\npeaks resemble fingers. The name _Mons Pentadactylus_ given to the\r\nmountain in antiquity, and quoted by Ptolemy, would appear to have\r\nreferred only to this northern mass, and not to the Faraid group as\r\na whole.\r\n\r\nThe second mass presents from most aspects the form of a nearly\r\nflat-topped mountain with a little peak on it and very steep\r\nsides. Its highest point, situated in latitude 23° 30′ 53″,\r\nlongitude 35° 20′ 25″, is 1,259 metres above sea, and forms a\r\nmain triangulation point; it is too sharp to support an instrument or\r\neven a beacon, and observations had to be taken from an auxiliary\r\nstation a little distance away from the summit and reduced to\r\ncentre. In ascending this peak as a survey station I approached\r\nit from the west by the Wadi el Abiad and Wadi Abu Ribian, placing\r\nmy camp close under the mountain, on a sandy plain 450 metres above\r\nsea-level and one and a half kilometres north-west of the summit. The\r\nclimb of 800 metres was steep, but not dangerous, and occupied about\r\nthree hours. The lower illustration on Plate XIV (p. 192) shows the\r\ntop of the mountain; the lower of the two peaks is the one occupied\r\nfor triangulation.\r\n\r\nThe third mass of Faraid is a great expanse of peaks extending over\r\neighteen kilometres north and south and some twelve kilometres east\r\nand west. Its highest peak, called “The Bodkin” by the Admiralty\r\nsurveyors, has the position latitude 23° 28′ 58″, longitude 35°\r\n20′ 35″, and rises to 1,232 metres above sea-level, dominating\r\nthe rest of the mass both by its height and its singular form;\r\nit is a great sharp pinnacle, apparently unclimbable, visible from\r\ndistances of over 100 kilometres in nearly all directions, and a very\r\nconspicuous landmark. South and west of “The Bodkin” are numerous\r\nother peaks, some of which have been fixed by triangulation; several\r\nof them rise to over 900 metres above the sea, and the whole forms\r\na compact mass across which there appears to be no passage for camels.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Fereyid=, the fourth and most southerly of the masses\r\nconstituting the Faraid group, is a small spiky range quite detached\r\nfrom the rest, about seven kilometres north of the Wadi Rahaba. It\r\nhas two main peaks, close together, of which the north-western one\r\nis slightly the higher and is surmounted by a beacon, 612 metres\r\nabove sea-level, in latitude 23° 17′ 29″, longitude 35° 22′\r\n48″. In occupying this peak as a triangulation station, the camp\r\nwas fixed in one of the heads of a nameless wadi draining past the\r\nnorth face of the mountain to the sea, at an altitude of 200 metres\r\nabove sea-level and 850 metres north-north-east of the beacon. The\r\nascent was easy till within about fifty metres of the summit, when\r\nit became difficult and rather dangerous, and there is very little\r\nroom on the top. I had to remain six days on this mountain owing to\r\nalmost continuous haze and clouds blocking the view.\r\n\r\nThe drainage from the western faces of the entire Faraid group\r\nis taken by the Wadi Rahaba. That from the peaks north of “The\r\nBodkin” is collected by the Wadi el Abiad and its feeders the Rod\r\nElbel and Wadi Abu Ribian, while the more southern parts are drained\r\nby various other tributaries of Wadi Rahaba, of which the principal\r\nare the Wadis Dagalai lil Rahaba, Abu Had, and el Marafai. The heads\r\nof Wadi el Abiad and its feeders cross a sloping sandy plain which\r\nflanks the main peaks on the west. Of the eastern drainage, less has\r\nbeen seen; the two principal drainers of the eastern face appear to\r\nbe the Wadis el Sorubiab and Bint el Kurdum, which unite together\r\nin a small lagoon close to the coast in latitude 23° 30′. The\r\nhead of the Wadi Bint el Kurdum is between “The Bodkin” and the\r\nflat-topped mountain to the north of it, and from the summit of the\r\nlatter it appeared as though there might be a possible pass by it\r\nacross the range into the heads of Wadi Abu Ribian; but I did not have\r\nan opportunity of testing this. The foot-hills are only some five or\r\nsix kilometres from the coast near the north parts of the range, but\r\nas one goes south the width of the coast-plain increases somewhat,\r\nand is about twelve kilometres near Gebel Fereyid. Notwithstanding\r\nthe height of the Faraid mountains, their proximity to the coast,\r\nand the clouds they frequently attract, there appear to be no wells\r\nin the wadis draining from them; the explanation is probably to be\r\nsought in the fact that the weathering of the granite of which they\r\nare composed produces large expanses of coarse sand round their feet,\r\nin which the rainfall is rapidly absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =The Awamtib — Abraq — Dif — Aqab el Negum — Mishbih Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains of this large and irregular group occupy the western\r\nparts of the great drainage basin of Wadi Hodein, some of the\r\nchief of them forming the main watershed separating that basin from\r\nthose of the Wadis Kharit and Alaqi. The northern mountains of the\r\ngroup are high broken sandstone plateaux, while the southern ones\r\nconsist largely of granite. The sandstone ranges of Abraq, Hodein,\r\nand Dif are remarkable for the numerous springs at their bases,\r\nwhich render this district (_see_ the large scale map on Plate XV)\r\none of great importance to travellers.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Awamtib= is the highest peak of a great mass of high sandstone\r\nhills forming the main watershed between latitudes 23° 20′ and\r\n23° 30′ and extending for some eight or ten kilometres on either\r\nside of the meridian of 34° 30′. The highest peaks of the mass are\r\nmostly well to the west of the actual watershed, and the principal\r\ndrainage channels run westward, those to the east, the feeders of\r\nWadi Muegil, being shorter. Gebel Awamtib is near to the south-east\r\ncorner of this mass, and is itself situated about six kilometres\r\nwest of the watershed. It is nearly separated from the surrounding\r\nhills by wadis, and forms a conspicuous peak from the west; but the\r\nneighbouring hills approach it so nearly in height that it is not\r\nso easily distinguished from the east. It may, however, be picked\r\nout by the triangulation beacon which marks its summit, 793 metres\r\nabove sea-level, in latitude 23° 20′ 59″, longitude 34° 26′\r\n39″. Gebel Awamtib is drained westward by the Wadi Awamtib (a\r\ntributary of Wadi Timsah), the heads of which nearly surround it. In\r\noccupying the station I pitched my camp in a small feeder of the Wadi\r\nAwamtib, two and a quarter kilometres south-west of the summit and 456\r\nmetres above sea-level. The climb from this place was easy enough,\r\nbut rather long, and on reaching the top I found it would have been\r\nbetter to have approached the mountain by another feeder almost due\r\nwest of the beacon, as by this means a camp could have been placed\r\nmuch closer and the ascent would not have been more difficult. It\r\nis inadvisable to ascend from the east face of the mountain, for\r\nalthough one of the wadi heads passes close east of the beacon, the\r\nslope on that side is extremely steep and probably unscalable. The\r\ntop of the mountain is formed of large sandstone blocks under which\r\none can get good shelter from dews, though with little head-room. The\r\nview from it is shut in to the east by the peaks of Gebel Shebakhit,\r\nonly two kilometres distant; but the peaks of Gebels Um Harba\r\nand Zergat Naam can be seen to the north, while to the south and\r\nsouth-east one looks out over high sandstone hills in the foreground\r\nto the granite peaks of Gebels Shigigat, Aqab el Negum, Etresia, Um\r\nReit and Saalek. The most striking thing round Awamtib itself is the\r\nstrong westward dip of the sandstone beds of which it is composed,\r\nwhich has conditioned the drainage and the steep eastern face.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shebakhit= is a group of high sandstone hills a few kilometres\r\nnorth of Awamtib. It is drained north-westward by the broad Wadi\r\nShebakhit, a tributary of Wadi Timsah.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Dagalai=, the next member of the sandstone hill-mass to\r\nthe north, has numerous peaks ranging from 670 to 712 metres above\r\nsea. It is drained north-westward by the Wadi Dagalai, in which it\r\nis said that water can sometimes be obtained.\r\n\r\n                                                             PLATE XV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE DISTRICT OF ABRAQ & ABU SAAFA\r\n\r\nBall. Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Metal-Process. Survey Dept. Cairo 1910. (60-190)]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Khafur= is a group of high sandstone ridges overlooking\r\nthe sandy plain of Um Harba to the north. One of its higher ridges,\r\n560 metres above sea-level, bears a triangulation station, marked by\r\na beacon, in latitude 23° 29′ 54″, longitude 34° 29′ 19″. A\r\nremarkable feature of Gebel Um Khafur is the north-north-easterly dip\r\nof its sandstone beds at an angle of about 13°, almost constant over\r\na large area, with probably step-faulting parallel to the strike of\r\nthe beds; owing to these features there are developed a series of\r\nlong ridges, with a flat dip slope northward and a steeper drop to\r\nthe south, while the drainage channels run along the lines of strike\r\nand only break across the ridges at a few points. The drainage from\r\nthese channels, the chief of which is called the Wadi Um Khafur,\r\nmeanders northward over the plain to join a feeder of Wadi Garara.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Harba= is a conspicuous sandstone peak marked by a\r\ntriangulation beacon in latitude 23° 36′ 56″, longitude 34°\r\n30′ 38″. Rising to a height of 688 metres above sea-level,\r\nit forms the highest and central point of a long range running\r\nnorth-north-west and south-south-east from the Wadi el Garara past\r\nthe Galt el Aguz. The north end of this range is forked, the east\r\nand west arms being separated by a broad high valley, filled with\r\nblown sand, draining from near the peak of Gebel Um Harba northwards\r\nto Garara. A marked feature of the range is the almost constant\r\nnorth-easterly dip of the sandstone beds of which it is composed;\r\nthe ridges follow the strike of the beds, and present gentle dip\r\nslopes to the east with steep basset edges to the west. Gebel Um\r\nHarba overlooks to the west a great sandy plain, so that it is a good\r\nlandmark for travellers coming from that direction. In occupying it as\r\na station, I approached it by the broad sandy valley above-mentioned,\r\nand fixed the camp at 487 metres above sea-level and 800 metres\r\nnorth of the summit; the hill can also be reached from the west,\r\nthough the climb from the plain is about one hundred metres more. The\r\nascent becomes rather steep near the top of the hill, but presents\r\nno great difficulty. For a short time after rain, water can be found\r\nin pools in the gullies close to the east of the hill, but owing to\r\nthe porosity of the rock these never last long. The Galt el Aguz,\r\nnine and a half kilometres south-south-east of Gebel Um Harba, in a\r\ngully on the east side of the road to Bir Abu Saafa, lasts longer\r\nthan other pools in the neighbourhood, but even it only yields\r\nsupplies within a few months at most after rain, for the same reason.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Sididad= is a mass of high sandstone hills on the north side\r\nof Wadi Silsila, thirty kilometres east-south-east of Gebel Um Harba\r\nand overlooking the broad and sandy Wadi Naam to the east. The hill\r\nI ascended, one of the highest, was 623 metres above sea-level and\r\nnearly 300 metres above the plain at its foot. High sandstone hills\r\nextend north-westwards from Gebel Um Sididad to Gebel Zergat Naam,\r\nforming the western side of Wadi Naam.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abraq= is a great high sandstone plateau cut up by gullies\r\ninto more or less separate hills, outlined by the Wadis Silsila on\r\nthe north, Hodein on the south, Arned on the west, and Abraq on the\r\neast. The highest hills of the mass are probably two peaks close\r\ntogether on its east side, midway between Bir Abraq and the Wadi\r\nHodein, which rise to 705 and 699 metres above the sea. The principal\r\ninterest of Gebel Abraq lies in its forming a collecting ground for\r\nthe important springs of Abraq and Abu Saafa, which occur along its\r\neastern and southern feet. These springs yield constant supplies of\r\nexcellent water, due to slow percolation through almost pure siliceous\r\nrocks, and are of great value both to the local Arabs and to the\r\npassing travellers. There are two beacons on Gebel Abraq, one near\r\nBir Abraq and the other near Abu Saafa springs. The former, a main\r\ntriangulation point, is 667 metres above sea-level on a conspicuous\r\nridge in latitude 23° 25′ 19″, longitude 34° 46′ 48″; while\r\nthe latter is on the eastern edge of the plateau, in latitude 23°\r\n18′ 40″, longitude 34° 48′ 30″, and 639 metres above the\r\nsea. The eastern and southern slopes of the plateau are very steep,\r\nbecoming almost precipices at many points, and are the home of many\r\nconies and rock partridges, but one can ascend by taking advantage of\r\nthe frequent gullies which cut up the mass. The climb to either beacon\r\nfrom the plain is about 330 metres, and free from serious difficulty.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hodein= is a high sandstone plateau forming the south-east\r\ncontinuation of the Abraq mass, from which it is separated by the\r\nravine of Wadi Hodein. To the south it is cut off by Wadi Dif. A\r\ntriangulation beacon near the north-east point of the plateau in\r\nlatitude 23° 16′ 20″, longitude 34° 53′ 25″, is 695 metres\r\nabove sea-level, but further west the summits are rather higher. An\r\nextremely steep pass, practicable only on foot, exists to the south\r\nof the mass, leading from the Wadi Gihab into Wadi Dif, and forming\r\na short cut from Abu Saafa Springs to Bir Dif, but camels have to\r\ngo round the east spurs of the mountain.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Dif= and =Gebel Anfeib= together form a still further\r\ncontinuation south-eastward of the same great sandstone plateau,\r\nbeing separated from Gebel Hodein by the deep winding gorge of\r\nWadi Dif. The sandstone beds here dip to the north-east, and the\r\nhighest points are near the west edge of the mass, where they are\r\nflanked by lines of lower hills, formed of schists cropping out\r\nfrom under the sandstone. A triangulation beacon in latitude 23°\r\n8′ 24″, longitude 34° 59′ 19″, marks the south end of the\r\nhigh plateau of Gebel Anfeib; it is 705 metres above sea-level,\r\nand very conspicuous from the east, but it is generally invisible\r\nfrom the west side of the mass, owing to the ridges north-west of\r\nit being slightly higher. In occupying the point as a station, I\r\napproached it from Bir Dif, following up the Wadi Abu Hashim to its\r\nhead, then down the Rod Mukrayib round Gebel Lilowit, the south tip\r\nof the schist range, and turning north across various small wadis\r\nto a camp in one of the heads of Wadi Edunqul, at 315 metres above\r\nsea-level and 1,200 metres south-east of the beacon. This camp could\r\nalso have been reached from Bir Abu Saafa via the Wadis Hodein and\r\nAnfeib. The climb to the beacon, of 400 metres, is steep, but not\r\ndifficult, and occupies less than two hours.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Tibatib= is a conspicuous dark conical peak among the low dark\r\nhills which extend from Gebel Anfeib to Wadi Hodein. Its summit is\r\n396 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Butitelib= is a steep-sided little hill mass of grey felsite\r\nclose west of the easy pass which leads from the head of Wadi Abu\r\nHashim into the Rod Mukrayib, near the south end of Gebel Anfeib. It\r\nrises to 485 metres above sea, or eighty metres above the sandy pass.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Lilowit=, the south end of the schist range which flanks\r\nGebel Anfeib on the west, is 485 metres above the sea.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani= is a conspicuous isolated jagged mountain\r\nsouth of the Rod Mukrayib (which drains its northern face), and\r\nwest of Wadi Madi. The beacon on it is in latitude 23° 0′ 39″,\r\nlongitude 35° 0′ 53″, 829 metres above sea-level and about\r\n500 metres above the Rod Mukrayib. A conspicuous pinnacle close\r\nnorth-east of the beacon has practically the same altitude.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Niqrub el Foqani= is a mountain of granite and felsite\r\nrising to a height of 1,078 metres above the sea, from among the low\r\nhill country which separates Wadis Madi and Gemal, in latitude 23°\r\n52′. Its great height and isolated position render it a conspicuous\r\nobject in the landscape from great distances. It is drained by myriads\r\nof small wadis radiating in all directions, but which all eventually\r\njoin Wadi Madi on the east or Wadi Gemal on the west. It is best\r\nascended from the west side, where a camp can be got 1,500 metres\r\ndue east of the beacon on the summit and 496 metres above sea-level,\r\nin one of the stony heads of the channels draining towards Wadi\r\nGemal. The ascent from this camp occupied a little over two hours,\r\nand was not very difficult; but an attempt from any other direction\r\nwould most likely have failed, as the slopes to the south and east are\r\nextremely steep and in places precipitous. The top of the mountain\r\nis a very rugged ridge, so broken that it is an hour’s hard work\r\nto get along its 700 metres of length. The main ridge is surrounded\r\nby lower flanking peaks on the north, east and south, while from\r\nthe west there runs off a long ridge, curving round to the south and\r\nenclosing a small sandy plain south-west of the summit. This curved\r\nridge is cut through from east to west by a rather steep pass, 490\r\nmetres above sea-level. The view from the summit of Gebel Niqrub el\r\nFoqani is very extensive, as will be seen from the panorama drawn to\r\nscale from theodolite measurements on Plate XVI, but in the winter\r\nmonths the mountain is frequently wrapped in clouds for days together;\r\nI had to remain eight days on the summit in December 1907, before\r\nI could complete my observations, most of the time being spent in a\r\ncold wet mist which blotted out the landscape. The beacon on Gebel\r\nNiqrub el Foqani, in latitude 22° 51′ 29″, longitude 34° 56′\r\n49″, marks a point on the administrative boundary between Egypt\r\nand the Sudan, the limit proceeding east-south-east to Bir Meneiga,\r\nand south-south-west to Gebel Um el Tiur el Foqani.\r\n\r\nThe low hill country between Gebel Niqrub and Wadi Madi consists\r\nchiefly of east and west ridges formed by dykes. A rather high granite\r\nhill about ten kilometres to the south-east, close to Wadi Madi,\r\nis marked by a beacon and overlooks the well called Bir Madi; the\r\nbeacon is 556 metres above sea-level, or eighty metres above the well.\r\n\r\nTo the south-west of Gebel Hodein the sandstone runs off in a mass\r\nof very high hills called =Gebel Kala=, leaving a much lower area of\r\nschist hills in between, through which the Wadi Feqoh pursues its\r\nsandy barren course. Gebel Kala has not been closely approached,\r\nbut its principal peaks have been fixed by triangulation, and the\r\nhighest is 846 metres above sea-level. The scarps of these hills\r\nare very steep, and the mass appears to be much cut up by wadis\r\ndraining to Feqoh. The sandstone ceases just beyond Gebel Kala,\r\nand its place is taken by granite, which forms the mountains of the\r\nwatershed further south-west.\r\n\r\n                                                            PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEASURED PANORAMAS FROM THE SUMMITS OF GEBELS NIQRUB\r\n& GERF.

(60-190)]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Reit= is a conspicuous granite mountain rising to 857\r\nmetres above sea, seventeen kilometres south-east of Gebel Awamtib,\r\non the east side of the watershed. It can be approached either from\r\nthe west by ascending the tributaries of Wadi Timsah and crossing\r\nthe watershed (which is here flat and sandy) into Wadi el Dreb,\r\nor from the east by ascending the Wadi Um Reit. The best place from\r\nwhich to ascend the mountain is in one of the heads of Wadi Um Reit,\r\nwhich drains the west side of the mass. By following this up, a\r\ncamp can be placed about a kilometre north-west of the beacon and\r\n520 metres above sea-level. The climb of 337 metres from the camp\r\nis fairly easy, and only occupies about an hour. From the beacon\r\n(latitude 23° 15′ 4″, longitude 34° 34′ 17″), a good view is\r\nobtainable of the granite peaks to the south, which forms a complex\r\nmass with Aqab el Negum as the highest point; to the eastward the\r\noutlook is mostly over high broken sandstone plateaux.\r\n\r\nExtending south-west from Um Reit is a complex of granite mountains,\r\nwhich has not been surveyed in detail. The principal peaks have,\r\nhowever, been fixed by triangulation, and their positions will be\r\nfound tabulated in the list of points given in Chapter III. The chief\r\npeaks are =Gebels Etresia= (1,037 metres), =Um Markha=, =Shigigat=\r\n(1,023 metres), =Hamrat el Feg=, =Aqab el Negum= (1,148 metres),\r\n=Etus= (997 metres), and =Natetiai= (1,164 metres). An important\r\npass is said to cross the watershed at Aqab el Negum, though quite\r\npracticable for camels, it is a very high pass, whence the name of\r\nthe mountain, which signifies “Pass of the Stars.” To the north\r\nof Gebel Shigigat there is a sandy plain from which two conspicuous\r\nisolated hills rise to heights of 901 and 703 metres respectively\r\nabove sea-level; these hills appear, however, not to bear any\r\ndistinctive names.\r\n\r\nFurther south along the watershed, in latitude 22° 50′, are two\r\nconspicuous peaks of nearly equal height and not far apart, which\r\nfrom the east look like two hop-kilns. These are called =Gebel\r\nSheyenit=. The southern one is the higher, rising to 887 metres\r\nabove sea-level, while the northern one attains 853 metres.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Mishbih= is a huge bristling mass of granite peaks a little\r\neast of the main watershed, rising from the plain west of Wadi\r\nFeqoh in latitude 22° 44′. Being much higher than any other\r\nmountain in the neighbourhood, it is a very remarkable feature for\r\nlong distances. Though it has not been surveyed in detail, its\r\nchief peaks have been triangulated and the general shape of its\r\neastern parts is tolerably known by observations from Niqrub and\r\nKorabkansi. The highest of its many peaks, near the south-west end\r\nof the mass, reaches 1,353 metres, while the north-east peak, marked\r\nby a beacon in latitude 22° 44′ 18″, longitude 34° 41′ 20″,\r\nis 1,316 metres above the sea. The mountain is believed to be almost\r\nentirely drained by feeders of the Wadi Feqoh.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shweib= is a smaller hill-mass a little to the south-east\r\nof Gebel Mishbih. Its highest peak, which is at the north-east end,\r\nis 914 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shabih= is a very remarkable granite mountain rising abruptly\r\nfrom the sandy plain traversed by Wadi Feqoh in latitude 22° 45′,\r\nabout twelve kilometres east of Gebel Mishbih. From the north, it\r\nlooks like a very perfect cone, but as one passes it going south it is\r\nseen to be slightly elongated meridionally, and to have two distinct\r\npeaks, of which the northern and higher one rises to 1,117 metres,\r\nor about 650 metres above the plain. Its sides are very steep, and\r\nan ascent would probably be a matter of some difficulty. The Wadi\r\nFeqoh passes close west of the mountain.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um el Kalala= is a small range of granite peaks close to the\r\neast side of Wadi Feqoh in latitude 22° 50′. The peaks at its\r\nnorth and south ends, nearly two kilometres apart, rise to 672 and\r\n655 metres above sea respectively. In the low hilly country further\r\nnorth there are three conspicuous little peaks of dark aspect rising\r\nabove the general level. =Gebel Mismih=, the highest of these, rises\r\nto 599 metres above the sea; it is a nearly perfect cone twelve\r\nkilometres north of Um el Kalala, and about six kilometres east of\r\nWadi Feqoh. =Gebel Waqif=, nine kilometres west-north-west of Um el\r\nKalala, is less sharp, and reaches 556 metres above the sea; while\r\nthe third hill, which is unnamed, lies nearly between the last two,\r\non the west side of Wadi Feqoh, and attains only 504 metres.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Um Harba and Awamtib ranges there is open country,\r\nformed by a great sandy plain, over which the Wadis Ghadrib and Timsah\r\npursue their northward courses to join Garara, and the monotony of\r\nwhich is broken at intervals by extensive masses of moderately high\r\nsandstone hills. The principal of these hill masses are Gebels Nuggur,\r\nMulgata, Ziraga, and the Abu Hashim Hills. =Gebel Nuggur=, marked\r\nby a cairn, lies seventeen kilometres west of Um Harba, and a little\r\neast of the Wadi Timsah; it forms a detached north-westerly extension\r\nof Gebel Dagalai. =Gebel Mulgata= (545 metres) and =Gebel Ziraga=\r\n(553 metres), both marked by triangulation cairns, are the chief\r\nmembers of a long line of sandstone hills separating the Wadis Timsah\r\nand Ghadrib. The =Abu Hashim Hills= extend for great distances south\r\nand west of Bir Abu Hashim; the triangulation beacon on the hill west\r\nof the well in latitude 23° 41′ 44″, longitude 34° 3′ 33″,\r\nis 386 metres above sea, and sixty-six metres above the wadi floor,\r\nbut other hills of the group further south attain higher levels.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Mowisat=, seventeen kilometres south of Gebel Ziraga and a\r\nfew kilometres west of the Wadi Timsah, is a granite hill capped by\r\nsandstone. It is drained by the Wadi Mowisat. A track from Aswân\r\nto Bir Um Reit passes a little north of this hill.\r\n\r\nRound the heads of the Wadi Ghadrib, about the parallel of 23°\r\nnorth and the meridian of 34° east, are numerous higher hills, of\r\nwhich the principal are =Gebels Abu Rahia= (835 metres), =Romit=,\r\n=Baid el Khuruf=, =Reietit= (825 metres), =Um Rewat=, =Um Ghalqa=,\r\nand =Um Gotto=, while between these and Gebel Mowisat are the\r\n=Hamiskul Hills=. These hills are all composed of granite, gneiss,\r\nand schists, the higher ones, such as Abu Rahia and Reietit, having\r\nsandstone capping the igneous and metamorphic rocks which build up\r\nthe main masses. Gebel Um Rewat forms the divide between the basins\r\nof Wadi Kharit and Wadi Alaqi, its northern parts being drained by\r\nthe Wadi Reietit, a tributary of Ghadrib, while the south flanks\r\ndrain into the Wadi Um Ghalqa, a feeder of Wadi Seiga.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Gebel Mishbih there is hilly country, in which many\r\nof the peaks reach considerable heights. The principal hill-masses\r\nin this part are =Gebel el Naga=, a range about four kilometres long\r\nrunning north-west and south-east, twenty-two kilometres west of Gebel\r\nMishbih, with several peaks, of which the highest is 827 metres above\r\nsea; =Gebel Seiga=, a high hill (905 metres) about twenty kilometres\r\nfurther west, surmounted by a triangulation beacon and drained by the\r\nWadi Seiga; =Gebel Nesheb Hasan= and =Gebel Abgeya=, two hills west\r\nand south-west of Gebel Seiga, between Wadis Seiga and Abu Had; =Gebel\r\nUm Krush=, between Wadis Abu Had and Um Ghalqa; =Gebels Ribdab=, =el\r\nDeheis=, and =Abu Brush= (810 metres), to the west of Wadi Um Ghalqa;\r\nand =Gebel Kulyeit=, a conspicuous cone about fifteen kilometres south\r\nof Gebel Seiga, rising to 724 metres above sea. Most of these hills\r\nare of schists, though Gebels Abu Brush and Ribdab are of granite.\r\n\r\n\r\n              =The Gerf — Korabkansi — Abu Hodeid Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central mountains of the Gerf — Korabkansi — Abu Hodeid group\r\nform a compact cluster to the east of the main watershed between the\r\ngreat eastward draining Wadis Hodein and Ibib. The most considerable\r\nmass in extent is Gebel Gerf, an extremely rugged mountain tract\r\nsome twenty kilometres in diameter, having its highest point 1,419\r\nmetres above sea-level. The Abu Hodeid range, forming a southward\r\nextension of the Gerf mass, attains the somewhat higher level of\r\n1,488 metres; while the detached mass of Korabkansi on the west\r\nrises to 1,230 metres. Besides these main masses, from which I have\r\nnamed the group, there are numerous outlying ranges of lesser height,\r\nthe principal being the Beida range to the north, and the Hamra Dom\r\nrange to the east. The main characteristics of the central group are\r\nits extreme ruggedness, the presence of great masses of serpentine\r\namong its constituent rocks, and a relative abundance of good water\r\nsupplies. The wells and springs in the wadis draining from this\r\ngroup of mountains are among the best and most permanent of the\r\nwater sources of the Eastern Desert of Egypt.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Gerf= (_see_ map on Plate XVII) is a mass of rugged\r\nmountains, roughly circular in plan, some twenty kilometres in\r\ndiameter, extending between latitudes 22° 35′ and 22° 50′,\r\nand between longitudes 35° 8′ and 35° 20′. Its highest point,\r\nmarked by a beacon 1,419 metres above sea-level, is somewhat north\r\nof the centre of the mass, being situated in latitude 22° 42′\r\n6″ N., longitude 35° 12′ 16″ E. Approached from any side,\r\nGerf blocks out the entire view ahead. The central parts of the\r\nmass are entirely impassable for camels. There is no possible track\r\nacross it from north to south, nor is there any east to west pass\r\nacross it north of the Sherefa Pass (which skirts its south end)\r\nexcept by the heads of Wadi Shellal. The northern part of the mass,\r\nwhich is semi-detached by the passes in the heads of Wadi Shellal\r\nabove-mentioned, is sometimes called =Gebel Meneiga= or =Gebel\r\nKorbiai= after the important water sources of the same name in the\r\nwadis draining from it; and the north-eastern peaks are sometimes\r\ncalled =Gebel Muqur= from the spring Bir Muqur. But these names\r\nare, I am told, quite local, and the entire mass is usually known\r\nto the Arabs as Gebel Gerf. This application of a single name to an\r\nentire group of mountains, with scores of separate peaks, extending\r\nover about 500 square kilometres, is very unusual, especially when,\r\nas in this case, it is drained by wadis containing good wells and\r\nplenty of vegetation. The explanation given to me by the guides was\r\nquite comprehensible; they stated that Gerf was the only mountain\r\nmass in that part of the desert which was so extensive in every\r\ndirection as to prevent them getting a clear idea of its true shape\r\nin their wanderings over it. They can get all round it only by a\r\nrough journey of several days, and any endeavour to cross its main\r\nportion met with failure, so that they had perforce to regard it as\r\na single great mass, of the true structure of which they could form\r\nno satisfactory notion. The immense interest which the guides took\r\nin the mapping of this particular mountain tract fully confirmed the\r\nexplanation given. The mapping was accomplished by making an entire\r\ncircuit of the mass, and ascending a few of the principal summits.\r\n\r\n                                                           PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE DISTRICT OF GEBEL GERF.\r\n\r\nBall. Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Metal-Process. Survey Dept. Cairo 1910. (60-190)]\r\n\r\nThe highest point of Gebel Gerf had been singled out as a\r\ntriangulation station from far to the north, while approaching the\r\nmass from the Wadi Hodein. It was eventually reached from the west\r\nside after leaving Gebel Korabkansi, the approach being made by\r\nascending the Wadi Eirahimib, and going over the pass at its head\r\n(830 metres) into one of the heads of Wadi Um Reddam, turning round a\r\nspur and ascending another of the heads of the same wadi. The camp,\r\nplaced as high up the wadi as possible, lay about 1,500 metres west\r\nof the beacon, at an altitude of 820 metres. The climb of nearly\r\n600 metres to the summit occupied three and a quarter hours, and\r\nwas free from serious difficulty, though involving some tiresome\r\ntraversing of connecting ridges. The summit of Gebel Gerf is often\r\nwrapped in clouds for weeks together in winter, and cold northerly\r\ngales are prevalent. I found it necessary to remain on the summit for\r\nno less than twenty-one days and nights in January 1907, in order to\r\nobtain the observations necessary, and the discomfort due to enforced\r\ninaction and piercingly cold winds was considerable. The top of the\r\nmountain is a narrow ridge on which there is barely standing room\r\nfor an instrument, but about 100 metres southward along the ridge\r\nfrom the beacon there is a slight broadening where a small tent may\r\nbe pitched by hitching the ropes round rocks instead of tent-pegs.\r\n\r\nOn a clear day, the view from the summit of Gerf is a magnificent\r\none. The numberless rugged ridges and peaks of the Gerf mass itself\r\nstretch for miles around, and out beyond, in every direction except\r\nto the east, one can see the more distant mountains. In the north,\r\nthe most striking features are the distant spikes of Gebel Faraid,\r\nand still further off one may discern the blunter forms of Gebels Abu\r\nGurdi, Hamata, and Abu Hamamid, 180 kilometres away. To the east is\r\nthe coast-plain, with the granite peaks of Gebel Hamra Dom breaking\r\nthe monotony. To the south-east one may see the great peaks of the\r\nElba and Shendib mountains, 130 kilometres away, though these are\r\noften hidden by mist when everything else is clear. To the south,\r\none looks out, over the gneiss boss of Gebel Um Rasein, to the\r\nmountains, rising rank behind rank, of Medarai, Abu Hodeid, Adar\r\nQaqa, and Is; while a little to the left of the last-named one may\r\nsee the double-headed granite mass of Gebel Obkeik in the Sudan,\r\nmore than 100 kilometres distant, towering above the intervening\r\nEgyptian mountains. The panorama visible to the south and south-east\r\nis shown drawn to scale from theodolite measurements in the lower\r\nfigure on Plate XVI (p. 206). To the south-west, one can make out\r\nthe principal mountains of the Alaqi basin, while to the west the\r\nmountains of Korabkansi, Shabih, and Mishbih are conspicuous features.\r\n\r\nThe north portion of the Gerf mass, sometimes called Gebel Meneiga, is\r\ndrained by the Wadi Kreiga, which is a tributary of Wadi Hodein. One\r\nof the principal feeders of Wadi Kreiga is the stony Wadi Meneiga,\r\nimportant as containing perennial springs of good water, easily\r\naccessible to camels. The eastern and southern parts of the mass\r\nare drained by various feeders of Wadi Shab, the principal of these\r\nfeeders being Wadi Shellal el Sharqi, Wadi Muqur, Wadi Baaneit,\r\nWadi Diqdib, and Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi. The Wadis Muqur, Baaneit,\r\nand Diqdib, all contain wells or springs, that in Wadi Diqdib being\r\nright in the heart of the mountain mass, while the others are nearer\r\nto its periphery. The western flanks of the Gerf mass are drained by\r\nthe feeders of Wadis Feqoh and Madi, the principal being the Wadis\r\nSherefa el Gharbi, Eirahimib, Shellal el Gharbi, and Korbiai. The\r\nWadi Sherefa el Gharbi is important as leading to the Sherefa Pass\r\n(907 metres) which forms a direct road from Bir Sararat Seyet to the\r\nwell of Um Rasein, while Wadi Korbiai contains an excellent well at\r\nits head, easily reached by camels.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Dreb= is a many-peaked mass of mountains covering some sixty\r\nsquare kilometres, situated south-west of the Gerf mass, from which\r\nit is separated by the Sherefa Pass. Its highest peak is 1,293 metres\r\nabove sea, but there are numerous other peaks of but little inferior\r\naltitude. Its south-western portion looks on to the plain at the head\r\nof Wadi Feqoh, while to the south-east it is separated from Gebel\r\nMedarai by an easy pass leading from the head of Kwat Hewah westwards\r\ninto the head of Wadi Kreim, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh. Another pass\r\nis said to exist leading from Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi into the head\r\nof Wadi Dreb, where there is a well called Bir Bint el Dreb.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Medarai=, the next mountain mass to the south-east, is\r\nseparated from Gebel Dreb by the pass into Wadi Kreim above referred\r\nto, while at its south faces it is separated from Gebel Abu Hireiq by\r\nanother pass leading from one of the heads of Wadi Medarai westwards\r\ninto the Wadi Kirwau, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh. The highest point\r\nof Gebel Medarai, marked by a large cairn, is in latitude 22° 30′\r\n58″, longitude 35° 12′ 5″, and rises to 1,299 metres above\r\nsea-level. The north faces of the mass are drained by Kwat Hewah,\r\na tributary of Wadi Shab; the eastern flanks by Wadi Medarai, a\r\ntributary of Wadi Ibib, while the western faces drain by various\r\nfeeders into Wadi Feqoh.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Hireiq=, the mountain-mass next south of Medarai,\r\nextends eastwards, as a broad tract of many high ridges, almost to\r\nthe gneiss-boss of Um Rasein, while to the south it is united with\r\nGebel Abu Hodeid. The highest point of Abu Hireiq is 1,319 metres\r\nabove sea. Its eastern flanks are drained by tributaries of Wadi Ibib,\r\nwhile the western parts drain into Wadi Feqoh.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Abu Hodeid=, which forms a higher southward extension of Gebel\r\nAbu Hireiq, is really two ranges with the Wadi Abu Hodeid draining\r\nbetween them. The western range is the higher, its summit, marked\r\nby a beacon in latitude 22° 23′ 18″, longitude 35° 14′ 9″,\r\nbeing 1,482 metres above sea. The highest point of the eastern range\r\nis 1,256 metres above sea. The south termination of this eastern\r\nrange is a very conspicuous rounded peak of granite, 992 metres\r\nabove sea, called =Abu Hodeid Ogla=, which forms a good landmark\r\nfor travellers in making the wells of Abu Hodeid; the wells lie\r\nwest of this peak. The south parts of the Abu Hodeid mountains are\r\ndrained by the Wadis Shinai, Delawet, and Abu Hodeid, all feeders\r\nof Wadi Hasium, and all leading to important water sources. The\r\neastern faces are drained by Wadis Abu Hireiq and Tikraneib, which\r\nare likewise feeders of Hasium, while the western flanks are drained\r\nby feeders of Wadi Feqoh. The broad opening where Wadi Hasium passes\r\nto the south of the range makes a natural division separating the\r\nmountains of Abu Hodeid from those of the Adar Qaqa group.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Mansur Diab=, a dark mountain, 1,091 metres high, lying six\r\nkilometres west of Gebel Abu Hodeid, is not often visible from the\r\neast, being hidden by the higher ranges in front of it; but it forms\r\na conspicuous landmark to any one approaching from the west.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Gebel Mansur Diab, between the heads of Wadi Feqoh\r\nand Wadi Hasium, are some other mountains of considerable height, the\r\npositions of whose summits were fixed by triangulation, but which were\r\nnot closely approached. These are =Gebel Hadal Derqa= (1,108 metres),\r\nwhich as seen from the north appeared like a hog-backed dark ridge\r\nwith a conical semi-detached hill at its south-east end; and =Gebel\r\nHilwit Hasium=, which appeared to consist of two separate peaks\r\nsome three and a half kilometres apart, the higher or north-east one\r\nrising to 1,037 metres, the south-west one to 952 metres above sea.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Korabkansi= is a rugged mass of dark serpentine peaks and\r\nridges occupying a nearly isolated position some twenty kilometres\r\nwest of Gebel Gerf. Its highest point, marked by a triangulation\r\nbeacon, is situated in latitude 22° 39′ 16″, longitude 34° 59′\r\n55″, and rises to 1,230 metres above sea. The main mass is flanked\r\nby lower hills to the north and south, but is more open to the east\r\nand west. It is drained entirely by feeders of Wadi Feqoh, the most\r\nimportant of these being the Wadi Gemal. The upper portion of Wadi\r\nGemal is called Wadi Seyet, and is important as containing a well,\r\nBir Sararat Seyet; the well is about five kilometres north-east of the\r\nmain peak, at a place where the wadi cuts through the flanking hill\r\nrange. For the ascent of the mountain, it is best to turn westward\r\nfrom near the well, and follow up one of the tributaries of Wadi Seyet\r\nwhich leads right into the heart of the mountain; here a camp can be\r\npitched at 765 metres above sea-level, and the ascent of 465 metres\r\nto the summit, from which there is a grand view, can be accomplished\r\nin less than two hours. The ascent and descent require some care,\r\nowing to the steepness of the slopes (the observed depression angle\r\nfrom summit to camp was 29¼°) and the rottenness of the rock, which\r\ncomes away in lumps at a touch. The accumulated debris, consisting\r\nof small fragments of serpentine, sets at just the angle of repose,\r\nso that in coming down one can stick one’s feet firmly in the mass\r\nand slide down with it for a hundred metres or more without exertion,\r\ntaking care only not to be shot over a sudden drop of the face. The\r\nrocks are highly magnetic, and the compass is much disturbed anywhere\r\non or about the mountain. The mass of high hills which forms the\r\nsouthward extension of Korabkansi, with peaks and ridges rising to\r\nover 900 metres above sea-level, is called =Gebel Wadhait=. It is\r\ndrained on the north by Wadi Wadhait, a tributary of Wadi Seyet,\r\nand on the west by the Wadi Kamoyib, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Rasein= is a triple-headed gneiss boss rising up boldly\r\namong schists to the east of Gebel Medarai. Its remarkable form\r\nand light colour render it a conspicuous feature to a traveller\r\napproaching it from the north-east, and it is an important landmark\r\nfor the well, Bir Um Rasein, which exists in a small wadi at its\r\nnorth foot. The highest peak of the three, marked by a triangulation\r\nbeacon in latitude 22° 28′ 12″, longitude 35° 20′ 19″,\r\nis 909 metres above sea-level. For ascending the mountain, it is\r\nbest to follow up the Wadi Merdiyeb for a short distance on the\r\nwest side of the range, and a camp can be placed at 386 metres\r\nabove the sea in a small tributary gully which drains from the main\r\nmountain. The climb of 523 metres to the beacon is steep in places,\r\nbut can be accomplished in two hours without difficulty by any one\r\nused to negotiating smooth steep rocks. The top of the mountain is\r\nmore convenient for observation than most others in this region,\r\nand there is a good view from it. The beacon is on a smooth hard\r\ngranite surface, with plenty of room to walk round an instrument,\r\nwhile a little to the west there is a good place to pitch a small\r\ntent, and a convenient cave for servants to sleep in.\r\n\r\n=Kilia Arib=, another isolated granite mass about six kilometres\r\nfurther east, rises to 647 metres above sea, and is a landmark for\r\nthe mouth of Wadi Diqdib, which contains a well.\r\n\r\nTo the east and south of Kilia Arib are some smaller granite hills\r\ncalled Tibashoi. Though rising only some fifty or sixty metres\r\nabove the plain, these hills are conspicuous landmarks from their\r\nisolated position. The northern, central, and southern ones are\r\ncalled respectively =Tibashoi Dumat=, =Tibashoi Tumalhoi=, and\r\n=Tibashoi Tomakolat=. Another hill of similar size and character,\r\nfive kilometres north-north-east of Kilia Arib, is called =Tuquqî=.\r\n\r\n=Qrein Salama= is a little group of diorite hills rising from the\r\ncoast-plain to the east of Gebel Gerf. The highest hill of the group,\r\n354 metres above sea, forms a conspicuous landmark which is visible\r\nfor long distances.\r\n\r\n=Berget Abu Sarib= is a tract of low dark hills, with much drifted\r\nsand, lying a few kilometres north-east of Qrein Salama.\r\n\r\n=Gimeida=, a small but conspicuous black conical hill, rising to\r\nsixty metres above the coast-plain, or 123 metres above sea-level,\r\nis important as a landmark for ships entering Mersa Shab. A\r\ntriangulation beacon has been erected on the summit, the position of\r\nwhich is latitude 22° 46′ 29″, longitude 35° 37′ 49″. The\r\nazimuth from the beacon to the big tree at Mersa Shab is N. 62½°\r\nE. A much lower dolerite ridge, two kilometres east of Gimeida,\r\nis called =Umarawi=.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hamra Dom= is a range of remarkable red granite hills rising\r\nabruptly from the coast-plain near latitude 22° 40′ and longitude\r\n35° 40′. The range has a total length from north to south of\r\nabout eleven kilometres, the highest peak being near the centre of\r\nthe range. A beacon on this highest peak has the position latitude\r\n22° 39′ 6″, longitude 35° 38′ 42″, altitude 389 metres\r\nabove sea. Care is necessary in sighting this peak, for there are\r\ntwo others near it of nearly equal height; the beacon is on the\r\nsouthernmost one of the three peaks near the centre of the range. A\r\npass leads across the range a kilometre south of the beacon. Gebel\r\nHamra Dom is a locality well known to the Arabs, in consequence of\r\nits being occasionally favoured with some rainfall. In January 1907\r\nthe district round the mountain was covered with grass after a recent\r\nfall of rain, but the hundreds of camels and other animals which the\r\nArabs took to graze at the place had eaten it all up when I arrived\r\nthere in February. At times of rainfall there is water to be got in\r\nthe sandy bed of a little wadi to the north of the beacon, at a place\r\ncalled Ti Dabei Hamra Dom; but it does not last long after rain. Gebel\r\nHamra Dom is drained almost entirely by feeders of Wadi Ibib.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous smaller hills to the west of Gebel Hamra Dom, but\r\nonly the largest of them, =Tibansi Tikam Ankwei=, bears a special\r\nname. This is a granite hill rising to 345 metres above sea-level,\r\nsituated eleven kilometres due west of the beacon on Gebel Hamra Dom.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Khashab= and =Gebel Beidâ= together form a complex range\r\nof high hills mostly composed of schists to the north of Gebel\r\nGerf. The range has its long axis north-west and south-east, with\r\na length of some twenty-five kilometres and an average breadth of\r\nabout eight kilometres. The highest point of the range is marked by a\r\ntriangulation beacon on Gebel Beidâ, 715 metres above sea-level, in\r\nlatitude 23° 0′ 14″, longitude 35° 16′ 54″. The north-west\r\npart of the range is drained by the heads of Wadi Khashab, a tributary\r\nof Wadi Hodein. The eastern faces are drained by the Wadi Beidâ and\r\nvarious other feeders of Wadi Hodein, while the south and south-west\r\nportions of the mass are drained by small tributaries of Wadi Kreiga,\r\nitself a tributary of Wadi Hodein. So far as I know, the range can\r\nonly be crossed by camels at one place, near the centre of its length,\r\nwhere it is cut through by the Wadi Beidâ; coming from the west,\r\none must make for the pass (395 metres above sea, stony but not\r\nsteep) which separates the heads of Wadi Khashab and Wadi Beidâ;\r\nthe road is well known as leading to the well called Bir Beidâ.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Humariai= is an isolated hill, 563 metres above sea, a few\r\nkilometres to the west of Gebel Beidâ.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Kolaiqo= is a small hill-mass lying off the south-eastern\r\nextremity of the Khashab — Beidâ range, from which it is separated\r\nby the Wadi Kreiga. Its highest point, marked by a triangulation\r\nbeacon, is in latitude 22° 54′ 13″, longitude 35° 24′ 34″,\r\nat an altitude of 320 metres above sea-level. The drainage is\r\nmostly into Wadi Kreiga, but the south-eastern parts of the hills\r\ndrain into Wadi Kolaiqo, a very shallow ill-defined drainage line\r\ncoursing independently to sea across the sandy coast-plain. To the\r\nnorth of Gebel Kolaiqo there are two long lines of low hills forming\r\nlow outliers of Nubian sandstone.\r\n\r\n=Ti Qireira= is the name given to two low hills rising from the\r\ncoast-plain about half-way between Gebel Kolaiqo and the black conical\r\nhill of Gemeida. These hills, four kilometres apart, rise only some\r\nfifty or sixty metres above the plain, but they are conspicuous\r\nlandmarks, and hence bear a name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 =The Meisah — Adar Qaqa — Is Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Meisah — Adar Qaqa — Is group of mountains extends northwards\r\nfrom the Sudan frontier in longitude 35½°. It is separated from\r\nthe Gerf — Abu Hodeid masses to the north by the Wadi Hasium; on\r\nthe east, the great Wadi Di-ib divides it from the mountains of the\r\nElba group; while to the west it is not sharply marked off from the\r\nrather lower mountainous tract of the upper Alaqi basin. Gebels Adar\r\nQaqa (1,469 metres) and Is (1,736 metres) are on the main watershed,\r\nwhile Hadal Aweib Meisah (1,224 metres) forms the highest point\r\nof a huge rugged spur running northwards on the east side of the\r\nwatershed. To the east of the main mountains of the group, between\r\nthem and the Wadi Di-ib, are a number of detached mountain and\r\nhill-masses, of which the principal are Gebels O Shakafa, Um Ein,\r\nQara Saba, Warabeit, Adar Aweib, and Shiab.\r\n\r\n=Hadal Aweib Meisah= is a conspicuous double-topped mountain of\r\na somewhat conical shape. Its summit, marked by a triangulation\r\nbeacon, is 1,224 metres above sea-level, and has the position\r\nlatitude 22° 16′ 39″, longitude 35° 31′ 55″. In plan\r\nit is almost circular, three-fourths of the circumference of its\r\nbase being formed by the Wadis Awitla and Lasewid (feeders of Wadi\r\nMeisah), while the remaining fourth forms a connexion by which the\r\nmountain is joined to the long ridge of Gebel Qidmib. The ascent of\r\nthe mountain was made from a camp one and three-quarter kilometres\r\ndue east of the summit, in a small feeder of Wadi Lasewid, close\r\nto the spring called Megwel Um Edwa. Camels cannot get quite up to\r\nthe spring, but a camp can be placed a little way further down the\r\ngully at an altitude of 596 metres above sea, and the climb of 628\r\nmetres to the top of the mountain is easily accomplished on foot in\r\nabout two hours. The mountain is composed of dark gabbroid rock, the\r\nsummit being composed of great blocks, weathered to a rusty brown on\r\ntheir surfaces; the rock is highly magnetic, and the compass points\r\nseveral degrees east of north at the beacon owing to local attraction.\r\n\r\n                                                          PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE DISTRICT OF MEISAH & WADI DI-IB.\r\n\r\nBall. Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Metal-Process. Survey Dept. Cairo 1910. (60-190)]\r\n\r\n=Iarih Meisah= is the name given to a tract of low granite hills with\r\nsandy interspaces, which lies to the south of Hadal Aweib Meisah. It\r\nforms the head of Wadi Baueiwai.\r\n\r\nAbout three kilometres west of Hadal Aweib Meisah, a high ridge,\r\nover 1,000 metres in height, courses north and south for over\r\nfourteen kilometres. The north end of this ridge bifurcates to form\r\n=Gebel Qidmib=; the Wadi Qidmib, draining northwards to Wadi Ibib,\r\nhas its head between the two branches of the ridge, where there is\r\na well called Bir Qidmib.\r\n\r\n=O Shakafa= is a very remarkable hill seven kilometres north-east\r\nof Hadal Aweib Meisah. O Shakafa derives its name, which signifies\r\n“the barrier,” from the fact that it appears to block the way\r\nto the traveller ascending the Wadi Meisah. Its crest, formed by\r\na ridge of hard jaspery quartzite, rises precipitously from among\r\na mass of softer rocks, some of which show remarkably brilliant\r\ncolours due to iron staining. The cairn on the summit is in latitude\r\n22° 19′ 44″, longitude 35° 34′ 42″, and 751 metres above\r\nsea-level. There is barely standing room on the top of the ridge,\r\nwhich needs careful climbing owing to its precipitous nature. O\r\nShakafa is a good landmark for Bir Meisah, which lies in the wadi\r\nabout three kilometres north-east of the summit; and for the easy\r\npass of Sarob Kwan, which lies four kilometres to the south-east.\r\n\r\nTo the north of O Shakafa there extends a great tract of high hills,\r\ndivided into two portions by the northward-coursing Wadi Orgem. The\r\nwestern portion of this hill-tract culminates in =Gebel Orgem=, the\r\ntwo peaks of which rise respectively to 779 and 775 metres above the\r\nsea, while its northern end forms the high sand-swathed hill called\r\n=Baqari Daba=. The eastern portion of the tract, containing the\r\nimportant wells Bir Um Bishtit and Bir Meisah, as well as the galts\r\nof Meis-heit-ar, is rather more complex, and is cut into two parts by\r\nthe Wadi Um Bishtit. Its northern part ends in a conspicuous gneiss\r\nhill called =Adar Aweib Um Bishtit=, while the hills immediately\r\nnorth of O Shakafa are called =Gebel Meis-heit-ar=.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Adar Qaqa= is a very conspicuous granite mountain about\r\ntwenty-three kilometres west of Hadal Aweib Meisah. Its highest peak\r\nis in latitude 22° 13′ 47″, longitude 35° 19′ 0″, and rises\r\nrather precipitously to 1,606 metres above sea-level. Adar Qaqa is\r\ndrained principally by the Wadi Hasium, which courses northward past\r\nthe western side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Soaorib= is a rather long mountain range which adjoins\r\nthe south part of Adar Qaqa and sweeps round to the south-east,\r\nforming the main watershed. Its highest point is 1,469 metres above\r\nsea-level. Its north-western face is drained by Wadi Mantil Hasium,\r\nwhich forms one of the heads of Wadi Hasium. The north-eastern flanks\r\nare drained by the Wadi Haiyo and other feeders of Wadi Soaorib, while\r\nthe south-west faces drain into the Wadi Kirir and the Miti-Kwan,\r\ntributaries of Wadi Alaqi.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Leqaq= (1,192 metres) and =Gebel Um Seleim= (1,098 metres)\r\nare two mountains, both with long northward spurs, lying north-east\r\nof Adar Qaqa, between that mountain and the Wadi Soaorib. They\r\nare drained by various feeders of the Wadis Hasium and Soaorib, the\r\nprincipal being the Rod Anut Berer, which runs northward from between\r\ntwo mountains to join Wadi Hasium, and the Wadi Hankuk, which rises\r\nto the south of Gebel Leqaq and courses round the south-east flanks\r\nto join Wadi Soaorib.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Gebels Leqaq and Um Seleim there stretches a sandy\r\nplain, over which the Wadis Hasium, Ibib, and Soaorib pursue their\r\nnorthward course. Low hills rise here and there from this plain,\r\nthe most conspicuous being =Gebel Hamra Tit=, a double-peaked granite\r\nhill, rising to 642 metres above the sea; =Kulet Meigrum= and =Kulet\r\nTinasal= are two somewhat smaller hills situated respectively six\r\nkilometres north-north-east and six kilometres east-north-east from\r\nGebel Hamra Tit.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Is=, the next great mountain to the south, forms the main\r\nwatershed just north of the Sudan frontier, the triangulation cairn\r\non its summit having the position latitude 22° 2′ 36″, longitude\r\n35° 28′ 4″, altitude 1,736 metres above sea. As seen from the\r\nnorth, Gebel Is is a somewhat flat-topped mountain of dark aspect;\r\nbut judging by analogy the apparent flat top is probably only a\r\nnarrow ridge seen broadside on. From the main mass a long spur of\r\nflanking mountains runs westward, and a high ridge, more or less\r\ndetached, rises to 1,474 metres six kilometres south-east of the\r\nmain summit. The northern and western faces of Gebel Is are drained\r\nby feeders of Wadi Alaqi, while its eastern and southern parts are\r\ndrained by various heads of Wadi Is.\r\n\r\nBetween Hadal Aweib Meisah and Gebel Is there stretches a mass of\r\nmountains with many peaks over 1,200 metres high; these appear to bear\r\nno special names. My guides stated that there are two passes over\r\nthe main watershed in this region. The first, called =Adar Ameit=,\r\nis a high pass practicable for camels; it lies about four kilometres\r\nto the north of the beacon on Gebel Is, and connects the two Wadis\r\nAdar Ameit el Sharqi and Adar Ameit el Gharbi which lie on opposite\r\nsides of the watershed. The second pass, said to be a difficult one,\r\ncrosses the watershed some five kilometres further north, forming\r\na connexion between the heads of Miti Kwan and Wadi Soaorib.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Miatit= (1,257 metres) and =Gebel Suruk= (1,377 metres),\r\nare mountain masses a little east of, and semi-detached from, the\r\nmain Is group. Gebel Miatit sends out a long spur north-eastward,\r\nending in a rather conspicuous hill at the foot of which there is\r\nsaid to be a water source called Megwel Aqwem.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shiab= is a collection of peaks rising from a rugged country\r\nof lower hills about twenty-eight kilometres east of Gebel Is. Its\r\nhighest point is 987 metres above sea-level. Gebel Shiab appears\r\nto form the main head of Wadi el Qurat, an important feeder of\r\nWadi Di-ib.\r\n\r\n=Eqrun= (the horns) is a conspicuous group of schist hills lying\r\nbetween the Wadis Meisah and Ibib. It has two principal peaks; the\r\nhigher one, surmounted by a triangulation beacon, has the position\r\nlatitude 22° 30′ 10″, longitude 35° 37′ 9″, and is 473\r\nmetres above sea-level; the other is about 400 metres south-east\r\nof the beacon, and is only five metres lower. Eqrun itself is an\r\nisolated hill group, but close to the north-east of it there is\r\nanother hill-mass of greater extent and of but little inferior height.\r\n\r\nThe country south of Eqrun forms an extensive tract of low hills\r\nwith much blown sand. Two conspicuous hills in this tract rise above\r\nthe rest and bear special names; these are =Tahaqayet= (432 metres)\r\nand =Titailibab= (593 metres).\r\n\r\n=Kolmanab= and =Einiwai= are two small but very conspicuous black\r\nhills eleven kilometres apart, rising from the sandy coast-plain\r\nbetween the Wadis Meisah and Di-ib. Both are surmounted by\r\ntriangulation beacons, that on Kolmanab being in latitude 22° 32′\r\n26″, longitude 35° 53′ 36″, 137 metres above sea, and that\r\non Einiwai being in latitude 22° 27′ 50″, longitude 35° 57′\r\n59″, 138 metres above sea. North-west of Kolmanab are some low\r\nbanks called =Tinadei=, while about mid-way between Kolmanab and\r\nEiniwai is an isolated low hill called =Ankalidot=.\r\n\r\n=Osnei= is a small but conspicuous red granite hill, rising to 251\r\nmetres above sea, thirteen kilometres west-south-west from Einiwai. It\r\ncontains a galt, which yields water for some little time after rain\r\nhas fallen locally.\r\n\r\n=Ti Keferiai= is a conspicuous little isolated group of dark hills\r\nof no very great height, situated in the fork where the Wadis\r\nDidaut and Baueiwai join to form the Wad el Qireira. There are\r\nheavy accumulations of blown sand round the north-east flanks of\r\nthe mass. The triangulation beacon on the summit has the position\r\nlatitude 22° 21′ 0″, longitude 35° 49′ 47″, and is 494\r\nmetres above sea-level. Ti Keferiai forms a good landmark for the old\r\nmines of Romit, which are situated in some lower hills five kilometres\r\nsouth-west of the beacon. There are numerous excavations here in\r\nveins of smoky quartz with calcite and chalybite, which penetrate\r\nthe country rock of highly crushed and decomposed diorite; a number\r\nof ancient grinding mills of diorite lie scattered about the place.\r\n\r\nFour kilometres north of Ti Keferiai, on the opposite side of Wadi\r\nDidaut, is a conspicuous hill of very red granite called =Adatalob\r\nAdara=, 385 metres above sea-level. Four kilometres further north-west\r\nis another hill, of nearly equal height, but of black aspect, called\r\n=Adatalob Hadal=. West of Ti Keferiai, at distances of five and a\r\nhalf and nine and a half kilometres respectively, are two conspicuous\r\nlittle hills rising from the plain, one on either side of the Wadi\r\nDidaut; these are called =Kikeiyet Sharqi= and =Kikeiyet Gharbi=.\r\n\r\nEast of Ti Keferiai is a great sandy tract stretching to the\r\nWadi Di-ib, from which low hills rise half swathed in blown sand;\r\nthe principal hill groups bear the names of =Gebels Tishushi= and\r\n=Tishushi Tiboki=.\r\n\r\n=Qara Saba= is a high and steep hill mass of dark aspect, rising\r\nconspicuously to 788 metres above sea, between the Wadis Didaut and\r\nBaueiwai, some sixteen kilometres south-west of Ti Keferiai. The\r\ntract between Qara Saba and Ti Keferiai is a waste of blown sand\r\nthrough which low hills protrude in places.\r\n\r\n=Adar Aqdeib=, a granite hill 736 metres high on the north side of\r\nthe Wadi Didaut, about half-way between Qara Saba and O Shakafa, is a\r\nlandmark for two small water sources and a pass. The first of these\r\nwater sources, Megwel Adar Aqdeib, is on the east side of the hill,\r\nin a little tributary of Wadi Didaut. The second, Megwel Didaut, is\r\nat the head of Wadi Didaut itself, in a separate rugged hill tract\r\nsouth of Adar Aqdeib. The west faces of Adar Aqdeib are drained by\r\nthe Sarob Kwan, half of which courses south-east to Wadi Didaut,\r\nand half north-west to Wadi Meisah, and the divide forms a well\r\nknown easy pass.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um Ein= is a huge hill-mass of dark rocks, rising to 901\r\nmetres above sea-level, nine kilometres south-south-west of Qara\r\nSaba. The beacon which marks the summit is in latitude 22° 11′\r\n52″, longitude 35° 39′ 4″. Gebel Um Ein is mainly drained\r\nby the Wadi Baueiwai, which curves round the south half of its\r\ncircumference. A small water source, Megwel Um Ein, is said to exist\r\non the north-east side of the hill, in a small wadi which forms a\r\ntributary of Wadi Baueiwai.\r\n\r\nA great tract of high hills lies between the Wadis Baueiwai and\r\nDi-ib. The northern part of the tract, which is cut off from the\r\nrest by the Wadi Warabeit, and is called =Gebel Geror=, has several\r\npeaks rising to over 500 metres; on the north it is flanked by huge\r\naccumulations of blown sand, while its southern faces are drained\r\nby fairly well-wooded wadis, tributaries of Wadi Warabeit. The\r\npart of the hill tract south of the Wadi Baueiwai is much cut up by\r\nwadis into masses which bear separate names. =Gebel Hamida=, which\r\nwith =Gebel Nubitra= forms the westernmost hill-mass of the group,\r\nis a series of high steep schist ridges rising in places over 700\r\nmetres above sea-level. The highest point, 754 metres above sea,\r\nis best reached by following up the Wadi Hamida till one comes due\r\nwest of the hill, and then striking up eastwards on foot; it can\r\nalso be reached from the east side _via_ the tiny trickling salt\r\nspring of Megwel Hamida, but I found this a long and wearisome\r\nclimb. To the north-east of Gebel Hamida is the pass called Bani\r\nSana, which is important both as a pass and as being the boundary\r\nbetween the territories of the Kurbeilab and Hamedorab Arabs. =Gebel\r\nWarabeit=, the part of the tract which forms the head of the Wadi\r\nWarabeit, lies south-east of Gebel Hamida, being connected with\r\nGebel Hamida on the one side and Gebel Mashushenai on the other;\r\nits highest point is 794 metres above sea-level. =Gebel Mashushenai=\r\n(634 metres) lies a little to the east of Gebel Warabeit; its north\r\nparts are drained by the Wadi Hashimaiyib, while the south portions\r\nare drained by Wadi Mashushenai, in the head of which is a well,\r\nBir Mashushenai. All the drainage from hereabouts ultimately reaches\r\nWadi Di-ib by way of Wadi el Qurat. =Adar Aweib=, a conspicuous and\r\nextensive granite hill-mass lying east of the foregoing, from which\r\nit is entirely separated by wadis, rises to 620 metres above sea;\r\nits summit is marked by a triangulation beacon in latitude 22°\r\n10′ 50″, longitude 35° 54′ 0″. In occupying Adar Aweib as\r\na station, it was approached from the Bani Sana pass by following\r\ndown the Wadi Warabeit and then turning up the Wadi Wieqwer, which\r\nleads to the eastern foot of the mountain. The camp was placed\r\nabout a kilometre north-west of the beacon, at an altitude of 284\r\nmetres above sea, and the climb of 336 metres to the top took only\r\nan hour and a half. A great variety of flowers could be gathered\r\nin the lower part of the ascent; the upper portion was slippery,\r\nthe slopes consisting of debris of decomposed granite resting just\r\nat the angle of repose. In descending from the mountain, I went\r\nnorthwards on foot, whence a steep pass led down to Bir Meheriqa,\r\nin the Wadi Di-ib; but the camels had to go round the south end of\r\nthe mountain by Wadi el Qurat, as the pass was too steep for them.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the group of hills just described, there is a rugged\r\ntract of low hills stretching away south to Gebel Shiab. Eastwards\r\nthis tract becomes lower and more sandy, terminating in a sandy plain\r\nwith low rocky ridges, over which the Wadi Di-ib pursues its northward\r\ncourse, becoming closed in again by hills abreast of Adar Aweib.\r\n\r\n\r\n         =The Mountains of the Alaqi Basin West of Adar Qaqa.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains of this group, which are scattered over an area of\r\nsome 5,000 square kilometres between latitudes 22° 0′ and 22°\r\n22′, and longitudes 34° 0′ and 35° 20′, are comparatively\r\nlittle known. The positions and heights of all the principal peaks\r\nhave been fixed by triangulation from considerable distances; but\r\nwith the single exception of Gebel Muqsim, which was occupied by\r\nMr. Villiers Stuart as his terminal point, none of the area has yet\r\nbeen officially surveyed.\r\n\r\nThe positions determined for the principal peaks will be found\r\nincluded in the list on pp. 51 to 64, and a general idea of the\r\nrelative positions of the mountains and drainage lines will be\r\nobtained from the orographical map on Plate I. A brief reference\r\nonly to the principal mountains is possible here.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Anweiyib= (921 metres) and =Eir Arib= (1,112 metres) are on\r\nthe main watershed. As seen from the north, the former appeared as\r\na long dark range, the latter as a light-coloured high short ridge\r\nwith a peak at its western end.\r\n\r\n=Gebels Duag= (1,328 metres) and =Himeitra= (1,231 metres)\r\nare connected with the watershed range of Adar Qaqa and Is by\r\nwestward-running spurs. Gebel Himeitra is a landmark for a well,\r\nBir Himeitra, which is situated a little south of the mountain,\r\nand also for the ruins of Darahib, which lie in the Wadi Alaqi some\r\ntwelve kilometres south-south-west of it.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Heianai= (1,256 metres) is a long range of mountains between\r\nthe Wadis Bint el Feqoh and Defeit.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Heleikonti= (1,151 metres) appeared from the north as a short\r\nhigh steep ridge with a little peak at its western end.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Egat=, one of the best known and most remarkable of the\r\nmountains of the group, is a high steep cone rising to 1,145 metres\r\nabove sea on the north side of the Wadi Alaqi in latitude 22° 5′\r\n39″, longitude 34° 52′ 15″. It is a landmark for Bir Egat,\r\nwhich lies about five kilometres to the east, and for the mines of\r\nAlfawi, which lie some ten kilometres south-east of the peak.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shanaiyet= (907 metres) and =Gebel Hamida= lie south of the\r\nWadi Defeit, between that wadi and the Wadi Egat.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hateib= or =Suhin= (854 metres) forms the main collecting\r\nground for the Wadis Hateib and Suhin, which are tributaries of Alaqi.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um el Tiur el Foqani= is a group of very high steep hills\r\non the south side of Wadi Defeit. It has a well-marked peak as its\r\nsummit, in latitude 22° 17′ 56″, longitude 34° 41′ 14″, 946\r\nmetres above sea-level. This peak forms a point on the administrative\r\nboundary between Egypt and the Sudan.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Um el Tiur el Tahtani=, situated some twelve kilometres\r\nwest-north-west of the foregoing, and on the opposite side of the\r\nWadi Defeit, is a somewhat similar but lower group of hills, its\r\nhighest point rising to 783 metres above sea.\r\n\r\n=Gebel el Adraq= (770 metres) and =Gebel Guqub= are two other\r\nhill-groups south of Gebel Um el Tiur el Tahtani, lying between\r\nthe Wadis Defeit and Alaqi. Gebel el Adraq is a landmark for some\r\nold mines called Betan, while Gebel Guqub is the collecting ground,\r\nthe drainage of which supplies the important well of Bir Guqub.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Muqsim= is a conspicuous mountain on the south side of the\r\nWadi Alaqi near the meridian of 34°. The triangulation cairn on its\r\nsummit is in latitude 22° 10′ 11″, longitude 34° 1′ 12″,\r\nat an altitude of 825 metres above sea-level. Gebel Muqsim forms a\r\npoint on the administrative boundary between Egypt and the Sudan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =The Elba-Shendib Group.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThis group of granite mountains is situated near the sea in the\r\nextreme south-east corner of Egypt, between longitudes 36° and 37°,\r\non and about the parallel of 22° of north latitude. Part of the\r\ngroup, including the highest peak (Asotriba, 2,216 metres) is in the\r\nSudan, and we shall here consider only the northern parts, which fall\r\nwithin Egypt proper. The principal mountains of the group are Gebels\r\nElba (1,428 metres), Shendib (1,912 metres), Hanquf (1,465 metres),\r\nShendodai (1,529 metres), and Shellal (1,409 metres). Besides these,\r\nwhich form a cluster of high rugged ridges and bristling peaks, there\r\nare some outlying hills to the east and west, and it is convenient\r\nto consider all the hills east of Wadi Di-ib as belonging to the\r\ngroup. The principal of these outlying hills are Gebels Balatitda,\r\nSul Hamid (572 metres), Qash Amir (724 metres), and Sela (560 metres)\r\non the west, and Karam Elba (586 metres) and Gebel Hadarba (217\r\nmetres) on the east of the main masses. The general relations of\r\nthe Elba district will be seen from the orographical map on Plate I,\r\nwhile the large scale map on Plate XIX shows the detailed features\r\non a larger scale.\r\n\r\nTowering to great heights from the coast-plain, the mountains of\r\nthe Elba group are very conspicuous from long distances either on\r\nsea or on land when the air is clear. But often for weeks together\r\nthey are so shrouded in mist as to be invisible even when one is\r\nfairly near to them. These very mists, which so often hinder the\r\nview being obtained, are the cause of much added beauty to the scene\r\nwhen the air is clear; for the moisture produces a rich vegetation,\r\nnot only in the wadis, but along all clefts right up to the tops\r\nof the mountains, and furnishes in addition the largest and most\r\nimportant water sources in the Eastern Desert. So abundant is the\r\nvegetation in all the wadis draining from Elba, that it is impossible\r\nto approach the mountains very closely with loaded camels, owing to\r\nthe closeness of the trees. Richest in water supply and in vegetation\r\nof all tracts in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, it is natural that the\r\nElba district should also be the greatest centre of desert population,\r\nand there are considerable settlements of Bisharin Arabs round the\r\nfeet of the mountains.\r\n\r\n                                                            PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE DISTRICT OF ELBA & HALAIB.\r\n\r\nBall.

(60-190)]\r\n\r\n=Gebel Elba=,[111] the most northerly mountain of the main group,\r\nis cut off from the mountains to the south by the Wadis O Sir Hadal\r\nand Serimtai; there is a pass between the heads of these wadis,\r\nso that a complete circuit of the mountain can be made, although\r\nfrom almost any aspect Elba appears to be joined on to the other\r\nmountains of the group. In plan, Gebel Elba is nearly a square of\r\nabout fifteen kilometres sides, with its diagonal in the meridian. It\r\nis a bristling mass of light-coloured granite peaks, flanked on the\r\nsouth and west by rugged hills of darker rocks. The highest point,\r\nthe “high peak” of the Admiralty Chart, is in latitude 22°\r\n10′ 3″, longitude 36° 21′ 52″, and 1,435 metres above sea;\r\nanother peak, slightly lower, but more conspicuous and nearer the\r\ncentre of the mass, was chosen for the site of the triangulation\r\nstation. The beacon on this latter peak is 1,428 metres above sea,\r\nand has the position latitude 22° 11′ 27″, longitude 36°\r\n20′ 52″. The peak which bears the triangulation station forms\r\na centre from which drainage lines radiate in all directions. The\r\nprincipal of these drainage lines, which are all well wooded, are\r\nthe Wadi Yahameib, which with its feeders Wadis Akau and Kansisrob\r\ndrains the north faces of the mountain, and unites with Wadi Aideib,\r\nwhich drains the north-east flanks; Wadi Serimtai, which by its\r\nfeeder the Wadi O Sir Eirab drains the south part of the mass and\r\nthen curves round north-eastwards to the sea; and the Wadi Yoider,\r\nwhich drains the western parts of the mountain by its three main\r\nheads called respectively Wadi Akwamtra, Wadi Qeirat, and Wadi O\r\nSir Hadal, and then courses northward to reach the sea.\r\n\r\nThe approach to Gebel Elba by the coast-plain from the north-west is\r\nsaid to be difficult, on account of having to cross an extensive tract\r\nof sand dunes, called I Hubal, which lies to the north and north-east\r\nof Gebel Sul Hamid. The survey expedition reached the mountain\r\nby marching eastward from Bir Meheriqa in the Wadi Di-ib. On this\r\nroad the sand was not found a serious hindrance, though progress was\r\nrather slow through O Harbub, a sand-choked wadi which was entered on\r\nturning eastwards just after leaving Bir Meheriqa. Skirting the south\r\nside of Gebel Sul Hamid over a sandy plain, we continued eastward\r\nwith a slight northerly bend till the jagged mass of Qash Amir came\r\ninto view; then striking due east again we entered some low hills\r\nand dropped by an easy pass into Wadi Siamtit, a little feeder of\r\nWadi Yoider; crossing the main channel of Yoider, we continued our\r\ncourse eastward across very sandy minor wadis, and turning a little\r\nsouthward we reached Bir Akwamtra, where we found a fairly large\r\nBisharin camp, in a stony wadi full of trees.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to ascend the mountain by way of Wadi Akwamtra, which\r\nheads right under the peak selected for the triangulation station. But\r\non arriving at the well we were still more than six kilometres\r\nfrom the head of the wadi, and further progress for camels was very\r\ndifficult owing to the closeness of the trees, and the bouldery nature\r\nof the wadi floor. Guides sent out to reconnoitre having reported that\r\nthe ascent could be made with less difficulty from the Wadi Yahameib,\r\nwe followed a very winding track leading over the Asut Duk pass into\r\nYahameib, and then made our way southward over the sloping bouldery\r\nplain, thick with trees and scrub, until the camels could get no\r\nfarther. The camp was pitched in a slight clearing at the foot of the\r\nmountain, three and a quarter kilometres north-west of the beacon, at\r\nan altitude of 343 metres above sea, or 1,085 metres below the beacon.\r\n\r\nThe climb to the summit was a long and tiring one, but very\r\ninteresting. Starting at 6.30 a.m. on April 25, 1908, we first\r\nfollowed up the Wadi Yahameib to its head in a sort of neck\r\nbetween two peaks; this neck, which we reached at 10 a.m., is\r\n1,093 metres above sea. About half way up to the neck, among some\r\nlarge granite blocks, there is a small spring of very pure water;\r\nit forms a pool holding about a gallon and a half, which fills as\r\nfast as it is emptied. Passing over the neck, we dropped down to a\r\nlevel of 984 metres in crossing the head of Wadi Akwamtra, and then,\r\nclimbing up the opposite side, we reached the beacon (1,428 metres)\r\nat noon. Except the last 150 metres to the summit, which was bare\r\nsteep granite, the whole climb was through a thick growth of trees,\r\nvery green and fresh, with a tangled undergrowth of flowering shrubs\r\nand some mosses and lichens. The trees grow very near to the summit\r\nand give plenty of shady resting-places. Acacia (_sellim_) trees cease\r\nabout 350 metres above sea, and new forms take their place. The most\r\nremarkable is a large tree called _Hohait_ by my Arabs; this tree,\r\nwhich I have not seen elsewhere in Egypt, grows in fair abundance to\r\nten metres or more high, with thick woody looking trunk and branches,\r\nthe foliage being great bunches of aloe-like leaves on the ends\r\nof the branches; according to my Arabs, it bears an edible fruit,\r\nof which they showed me the stone—a nearly spherical red one,\r\nabout as big as a pea, very hard.[112]\r\n\r\nThe top of the mountain is narrow and very rough, but narrow sleeping\r\nplaces can be found on ledges. The view from the summit in clear\r\nweather is very fine and extensive; the subjoined figure is from\r\na careful sketch which I made of the outlook southwards from the\r\nbeacon. But, as already remarked, the mountain is frequently shrouded\r\nin cloud, and of the ten days I remained on the summit in April and\r\nMay 1908 only three were clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—View from the summit of Gebel Elba.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of “glories,” or rainbow-coloured rings round the\r\nshadow of one’s head cast on to clouds below when the summit was\r\nclear, was well observed in the mornings. Three rings were specially\r\ndistinct and vividly coloured on April 26, and I was able to measure\r\nthe diameters with an improvised subtense apparatus; measuring to\r\nthe middle of the yellow in each case, I found the diameters of the\r\nrings to be 4½°, 8¾°, and 13°, so that the diameters increase in\r\narithmetical progression. The shadow cast by one’s head and body\r\nwas most distinct when the cloud-bank was most opaque; the rings,\r\non the other hand, were most brilliant when there was only a thin\r\nfilm of cloud.\r\n\r\nThe temperatures experienced on the summit were remarkable for their\r\nrange. On April 25, 26, and 27, 1908, the air was still and full\r\nof wet mist, and the days were oppressively hot, while the nights\r\nwere also warm and damp. On April 28, a cold north-west wind set\r\nin, which soon cleared the air; but with the clearness came such\r\na chilling of the air that it was impossible to stand up to the\r\ninstruments for observations for more than a few minutes at a time;\r\none was glad to take shelter behind rocks from the biting blast,\r\nand though we were well within the tropics and the spring was far\r\nadvanced, we sat shivering with blankets round us even in the sunniest\r\nand most sheltered spots we could find. The cold lasted till May 4,\r\nwhen we descended the mountain to be half roasted in the plains below.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, Gebel Elba is well supplied with water\r\nsources. The two chief are Bir Akwamtra and Bir Kansisrob, both\r\nsituated on the north side of the mountain. Between them is a small\r\nspring called Megwel Akau. On the south side of the mountain are two\r\nother wells called Bir Salalat O Sir, and Bir Sararat Serimtai. In\r\ntimes of rainfall there must be scores of rock pools along every\r\ndrainage line.\r\n\r\n=Karam Elba= is a granite hill rising to 586 metres above sea, close\r\nto the north-east foot of Gebel Elba, from which it is separated\r\nby a narrow wadi. Close north of Karam Elba are some low granite\r\nhills called =Takrat Riba=, while on the south side is another small\r\ngranite hill called =Mikeriba=.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Karam Elba are some granite hills which, though of\r\nno great height, are conspicuous owing to their position on the\r\ncoast-plain, and being used as landmarks by the local Arabs they\r\nbear special names. These are: =Alafot=, =Taar Ara=, =Kreishim=,\r\n=Abai Sis=, and =O Wota=, the last-named being the largest of them\r\nall. Some low banks north of Alafot are called =Alafot Onqwab=.\r\n\r\n=Qash Amir= (“Scragged Hill” of the Admiralty Charts) is\r\nan isolated hill rising abruptly from a sandy plain at the head\r\nof Wadi Eikwan, about fifteen kilometres west-north-west of Gebel\r\nElba. Qash Amir well deserves the title given to it by the Admiralty\r\nsurveyors, for it is a mass of sharp granite spikes which my best\r\nguides, skilled climbers though they were, could only ascend with\r\nthe greatest difficulty. Its top, marked by a beacon, is 724 metres\r\nabove sea-level and has the position latitude 22° 14′ 31″,\r\nlongitude 36° 12′ 20″. I had intended to occupy the summit as\r\na main station, but the guides who were sent to erect the beacon\r\nreported that the summit was so sharp a spike that there was barely\r\nroom for a beacon to be built, and that it would be impossible to set\r\nup a theodolite tripod on it, while there was not even a narrow ledge\r\nwhere one could sleep within several hundred metres of the summit.\r\n\r\n=Gebel el Sela= is a straggling group of high rugged granite hills\r\nrising from the sandy plain to the north-east of Qash Amir. The\r\nhighest of its peaks reaches to 560 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Sul Hamid= is an extensive tract of low dark hills, covering\r\nsome hundred square kilometres or so to the west of Qash Amir. Its\r\nhighest peak is 572 metres above sea. The north part of the tract\r\nis drained by the Wadi Di-it, the eastern part by the Wadi Eikwan,\r\nwhile the southern drainages pass into a very shallow channel which\r\ncourses westward over a sandy plain towards Wadi Di-ib, but becomes\r\nchoked with sand at O Harbub before reaching that great trunk wadi.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Balatitda= is a group of high hills lying between Gebel Sul\r\nHamid and the Wadi Di-ib. Its highest point is 592 metres above\r\nsea-level. Bir Meheriqa is situated at the south-west of the mass,\r\non the east side of Wadi Di-ib. The north flanks of Gebel Balatitda\r\nare swathed in blown sand.\r\n\r\n=Gebel O Sir Eirab= is really the south part of Gebel Elba; its\r\nhighest point is 842 metres above sea. Though its name Eirab means\r\n“white,” the mountain is composed of dark-coloured rocks. The\r\nexplanation is that the Arabs always give the names to the wadis\r\nfirst, and the adjacent Wadi O Sir Eirab has a white sandy floor\r\nbecause it drains from the granite mass of Elba; the mountain is\r\ncalled after the wadi near it.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hanquf= is a range of mountains some twenty kilometres in\r\nlength, stretching in a south-easterly direction to the south of\r\nGebel Elba and separating that mountain from Gebel Shendib. Its\r\nsouth-eastern portion, containing the highest peaks, is of granite,\r\nwhile the north-western portion consists of dark rocks. Its highest\r\npoint is the northerly one of two remarkable peaks near the south end\r\nof the range, and rises to 1,465 metres, while another summit near\r\nthe middle of the range reaches 1,397 metres. The northern part of\r\nGebel Hanquf is drained by the Wadi O Sir Hadal, a tributary of Wadi\r\nYoider; its eastern flanks by the Wadi Serimtai; while the western\r\ndrainage is to the Wadi Hareitra, which courses from between Gebel\r\nHanquf and Gebel Shendib westwards to join the Wadi Di-ib.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shendib=, which lies close south-west of Gebel Hanquf, is a\r\ngreat mass of very high light-coloured peaks flanked on the west by\r\na tract of moderately high hills of dark colour. The beacon which\r\nmarks the highest point, 1,912 metres above sea, is in latitude 22°\r\n0′ 48″, longitude 36° 16′ 30″. Shendib is the third highest\r\nmountain in Egypt proper, being surpassed in altitude only by El\r\nShayeb and Hamata. Besides the main peak, there are numerous others\r\nexceeding 1,600 metres in height; one of these, some two kilometres\r\nsouth-east of the principal summit, reaches to 1,863 metres and marks\r\nvery nearly the Sudan frontier; its latitude is 21° 59′ 56″,\r\nso that it is only some 120 metres south of the 22nd parallel.\r\n\r\nThe north portion of Shendib is drained by the Wadi Hareitra,\r\nthe south part by Wadi Shendib, both these being tributaries of\r\nWadi Di-ib.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shendodai= (“Castle Hill” of the Admiralty Charts) is\r\na high mountain mass lying east of Gebel Hanquf, from which it is\r\nseparated by the Wadi Serimtai. Its highest point, a well-marked peak,\r\nis in latitude 22° 3′ 1″, longitude 36° 25′ 31″, and rises\r\nto 1,529 metres above sea-level. Gebel Shendodai is drained by the\r\nWadis Um Seyal (a tributary of Wadi Serimtai), Mera Kwan, and Shellal.\r\n\r\n=Gebel Shellal=, situated close south-east of Gebel Shendodai\r\non the Sudan frontier, is a group of mountains of slightly lower\r\naltitude than the foregoing, its highest peak being 1,409 metres above\r\nsea-level. Gebel Shellal is drained by the Wadis Shellal and Aqilhoq,\r\nthe latter containing a good well, called Bir Frukit. A tract of low\r\nfoot-hills, some twelve kilometres broad, fronts Gebels Shendodai\r\nand Shellal seawards, leaving a breadth of some twelve kilometres\r\nof gently sloping coast-plain between them and the shore. One of\r\nthe foot-hills of Gebel Shellal, a conspicuous high dark-coloured\r\nridge near Bir Frukit, bears the name of =Gebel Balatitda=. (It\r\nwill be noticed that another hill group west of Gebel Elba bears\r\nthe same name).\r\n\r\n=Gebel Hadarba= is a little range of felsite hills with many peaks\r\nrising from the coast-plain close to Ras Hadarba (Cape Elba of the\r\nAdmiralty Charts). A triangulation beacon on one of the highest points\r\nis in latitude 22° 2′ 53″, longitude 36° 47′ 23″, at an\r\naltitude of 217 metres above sea. Gebel Hadarba is drained by a number\r\nof small wadis, most of which empty themselves into the quicksands\r\nof Kuatianai which cover the projection of Cape Elba. A high hill at\r\nthe south-west end of the Hadarba range bears the special name of\r\n=Wiekorei=, while a tract of low red hills on the Sudan frontier a\r\nfew kilometres south of the Hadarba range, is called =Timaiakwaia=;\r\nthis latter tract is chiefly drained by the Wadi Qabatit.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: The exception is El Shayeb, in latitude 26° 58′,\r\nwhich attains a height of 2,184 metres. _See_ BARRON and HUME,\r\nTopog. and Geology of the Eastern Desert of Egypt (Central\r\nPortion).

As will be seen on looking through\r\nthe list of water sources on pp. 244 to 250, springs are less common\r\nthan wells and rock basins, but some of the best known water sources,\r\nsuch as those of Abraq, Abu Saafa, Abu Hodeid, and Meneiga, belong\r\nto this class. The Arabic word for spring is _Ain_, but the Bedouin\r\nseldom use this word, calling springs and wells alike _Bir_, which\r\nproperly signifies a well. Small springs are called _Megal_ by the\r\nAbabda, and _Megwel_ by the Bisharin tribes.\r\n\r\nSprings may occur in any kind of rock, but the rock must be either\r\nof a porous nature or must contain fissures. Thus the springs of\r\nAbu Saafa and Abraq occur in sandstone, which is itself porous and\r\npermits the passage of water through the body of the rock, while the\r\nsprings of Meneiga occur in a crushed serpentine, which, though not\r\nitself a porous rock, is full of fissures and crush-planes, and thus\r\nis capable of holding and giving passage to underground waters. It\r\nis in consequence of the non-porosity and the comparative fewness\r\nof fissures in granitic rocks that springs are seldom seen to issue\r\nfrom rocks of this class.\r\n\r\nThe collecting areas of the Eastern Desert springs are mostly\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of the springs themselves. Thus,\r\nfor instance, the springs of Abu Saafa and Abraq are fed by the\r\nrainfall on the great sandstone plateaux which surround them, while\r\nthose of Meneiga are supplied by the rainfall on the mountain mass\r\nof Gebel Gerf. In consequence of the fact that the waters do not\r\ntravel very far underground before they issue from the springs, the\r\nwater is generally cool. The yield of the springs is usually small,\r\nrarely exceeding ten litres a minute from any individual spring, but\r\nit is wonderfully constant; the rocks of the collecting area form a\r\nhuge reservoir which only parts slowly with its water contents, and\r\nthus springs may go on yielding supplies when, after a succession\r\nof three or four nearly rainless years, many of the wells and rock\r\nbasins are quite dry.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, spring waters are very clear and potable. The purest are\r\nthose which pass through siliceous rocks such as sandstone; where\r\nthe rocks are rich in lime and magnesia, as serpentines and gabbros,\r\nthe salt-content of the spring may be fairly considerable, but there\r\nis no known spring in this part of Egypt of which the water is so\r\nsalt as to be disagreable to the taste.[114] It is their constancy\r\ncombined with the purity of their water that makes the springs the\r\nmost highly prized of desert water sources.\r\n\r\nSprings are mostly on or near the main camel roads, for the roads\r\nare naturally selected so as to utilise these constant water\r\nsupplies. Frequently, however, the spring is situated up a lateral\r\nvalley some little distance from the main track, and is more or less\r\ndifficult of access. The springs of Abu Saafa are on a main road,\r\nwhere the Wadi Hodein cuts cleanly through the sandstone plateau;\r\nbut those of Meneiga, being at the head of a _cul-de-sac_, are\r\nonly approachable by a branch track. At large springs the Arabs\r\ngenerally dig out a series of basins into which the water flows,\r\nso that these are always full of water ready for the camels of a\r\ncaravan to drink. At _megals_ there is usually no pool, or only a\r\nvery small one, in sand or detritus; this sand is scooped out and\r\nthe water is baled from the hole with a tin can. The absence of a\r\npool is probably due to a desire to check evaporation. The flow at a\r\n_megal_ is frequently so small that only a few litres per hour can\r\nbe obtained; the small trickling spring of Sikait, for instance,\r\nwas yielding only twenty gallons of water _per diem_ in 1906, but\r\neven this small supply was highly prized by the miners working there,\r\non account of its purity as a drinking water.\r\n\r\n_Megals_ are more likely to run dry than the larger springs, owing\r\nto their smaller collecting area. Any attempt to increase the flow\r\nof springs by blasting or excavation would probably only give an\r\nincrease in yield at the expense of constancy; the throttling of the\r\nefflux is doubtless in many cases the chief reason for the perennial\r\ncharacter of the yield of a spring, the rainfall being insufficient\r\nto maintain greater supplies than the springs yield at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               =Wells.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wells of South-Eastern Egypt are mostly shallow excavations\r\nin the alluvia of the wadi floors, tapping the drainage waters\r\nwhich slowly percolate underground Nilewards and seawards from the\r\nmountain ranges. They are naturally more frequent in the districts\r\nnear to the mountain ranges than in the lower reaches of the wadis,\r\nand the best wells are usually in well-defined trunk wadis which\r\ncollect the drainage from myriads of smaller valleys. The wells sunk\r\nin the wadis at points remote from the mountain ranges are of immense\r\nimportance to travellers crossing from the Nile, forming as they do\r\nthe only supplies in an otherwise waterless journey of several days.\r\n\r\nOn an average, water is reached at a depth of eight to ten metres;\r\noccasionally, where the wadi is crossed underground by a rocky\r\nbar, the natural damming enables water to be reached at very\r\nshallow depths. The shafts dug by the Arabs are generally wide\r\nand very crooked, in order to permit of a man descending to fill a\r\nwater-skin. Usually a “well” consists of three or four such shafts\r\nsunk in proximity. Occasionally, especially in the Bisharin country,\r\nthe shafts are lined with rubble masonry, and rough timbers may be\r\nstretched across the mouth to facilitate hoisting by ropes. There is\r\nnever any hoisting gear except at mines; rope is too much prized by\r\nthe Arabs for it to be possible to leave ropes unguarded at a well,\r\nso each caravan uses its own rope and skins. Occasionally, the shaft\r\nis so cranked that the water cannot be seen from above. The reason\r\nfor this is chiefly laziness in excavation; it is easier to deepen\r\na well by driving out laterally a short distance and then sinking a\r\nnarrow pit, throwing out the excavated material into the larger main\r\nshaft, than to hoist all to the surface. Near the wells one usually\r\nfinds _hods_, or mud basins, into which the Arabs pour the hoisted\r\nwater for their animals to drink. Frequently there are high _hods_\r\nfor camels and low ones for sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nAfter every considerable rainfall the wells become filled up with\r\nstony downwash, and have to be dug out afresh. There is no protective\r\nwall to prevent infilling; and, contrary to what might at first be\r\nthought, it is not laziness which conditions this circumstance. To\r\nthe Arab, wells are a last resource. After rain, all the _galts_\r\n(rock basins) are full of good water. The Arab knows that the supplies\r\nin these _galts_ will evaporate, while those in the wells, covered\r\nin by alluvium, are safe from loss by this cause. He therefore\r\ndraws his supplies from _galts_ as long as he can, and only when\r\nthese are empty does he open the wells. The main wells never fail\r\nexcept after unusually prolonged drought, and then the condition\r\nof the Arab is sore indeed. The Bisharin do not drink much water,\r\npreferring to nourish themselves on the milk of their flocks and\r\nherds; but in times of drought the milk supply falls off because\r\nthere is not sufficient moist vegetation for the animals to feed on.\r\n\r\nThe quality of water from the wells varies enormously with their\r\nsituation and at different times. When water is abundant, it is\r\ngenerally good; but as the supply falls off and the wells have to be\r\ndeepened, the slow infiltration carries abundance of sodium, calcium,\r\nand magnesium salts from the rocks, and the water is then often very\r\nunpleasant. The following analyses by Mr. Lucas of water-samples\r\nfrom some of the wells in 1906 will give a good general idea of\r\nthe salts present; the figures give milligrammes per litre (parts\r\nper million):—\r\n\r\n  ----------------+------+------+--------+--------+-------------+-------\r\n                  |      |      |        |        |     Bir     |\r\n                  |Sikait| Bir  |  Bir   | Bir Abu| Shadli[115] | Bir\r\n                  | Well.|Masur.|Metawit.|Hamamid.+-------+-----|Helie.\r\n                  |      |      |        |        |  I.   | II. |\r\n                  +------+------+--------+--------+-------+-----+-------\r\n   Total solid    |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   matter in      |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   solution       | 7,360|   880|   4,020|   1,720| 2,380 |2,980| 4,040\r\n  ----------------+------+------+--------+--------+-------------+-------\r\n   Cl             | 1,263|    57|   1,027|     225|   555 |  749|   323\r\n                  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   SO3            | 2,530|   263|   1,042|     318|   540 |  776| 1,447\r\n                  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   CaO            | [116]|   200|     350|     330|   310 |[116]|   610\r\n                  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   MgO            | [116]|    29|     116|      87|    69 |[116]|   211\r\n                  +------+------+--------+--------+-------------+-------\r\n   Equivalent of  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   Cl as NaCl     | 2,075|    94|   1,687|     370|   912 |1,231|   530\r\n                  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   Equivalent of  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   SO3 as Na2SO4  | 1,850| 1,377|     466|     550|   960 |1,377| 2,569\r\n                  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   Alkalinity to  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   methyl orange  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   calculated as  |      |      |        |        |       |     |\r\n   NaHCO3         |   500|   222|     550|     848|   298 |  260|   651\r\n  ----------------+------+------+--------+--------+-------+-----+-------\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the above waters were quite drinkable, though that of the Sikait\r\nwell was rather disagreably salty.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the water of one of the Halaib wells in 1895 is given\r\nby Dr. Natterer,[117] who found (in parts per million):—\r\n\r\n  Cl          336\r\n\r\n  SO4         449\r\n\r\n  CO3          48\r\n\r\nDr. Natterer records that the sample, which was clear, tasted slightly\r\nalkaline, and contained very distinct traces of nitrites and nitrates,\r\nfree carbon dioxide, free ammonia, and organic matter. During my stay\r\nof four days at Halaib in May 1908, I drank regularly of the local\r\nwell-water; I found it very hard, and though the Arabs seemed to\r\nlike it, its action on myself was so strongly aperient that I sent\r\ninto the mountains to Bir Frukit for purer supplies for use on the\r\nlong march to Port Sudan.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it is the magnesium salts which are the most harmful\r\nconstituents, the sulphate giving a strong purgative character to the\r\nwater. Such salts are naturally present in greatest quantity where\r\nthe rocks are gypseous, as for instance along the coast to the south\r\nof Halaib, where the wells of Ti Kureitra, sunk in gypsum and lined\r\nwith blocks of selenite, yield water of so purgative a character\r\nthat all my Arabs who drank of it became violently ill. In districts\r\nwhere the rocks are of very basic igneous types, such as gabbros and\r\nserpentines, the salt-content may also be fairly high. Water from\r\ndiorite country is somewhat better, that from granite better still,\r\nand that from sandstone best of all. There are practically no wells\r\nin clayey strata within the region here treated of, but Bir Qoleib,\r\nwhich is on the road from Daraw at about two days’ journey east\r\nof the Nile, is sunk at the foot of a clayey scarp, and the water,\r\nwhen I partook of it in 1907, was clouded with clayey matter so finely\r\ndivided as to be unfilterable through a Berkefeld filter even under\r\nstrong pressure, while the physiological action of the water was\r\nto produce very marked constipation. Wells near the sea coast are\r\nliable to be very salty from infiltration of sea water. As a rule,\r\nthe very salt wells, such as Bir Murra, Bir Muelih, Bir Shalatein,\r\nand Ti Kureitra, are used only by camels and sheep. When the Arabs\r\nhave to drink purgative water for lack of other supplies, they often\r\nmix milk with it, and I have found it wise to imitate them in this\r\nrespect, with liberal addition of brandy in some cases.\r\n\r\nWells are generally named after the wadi in which they occur, _e.g._,\r\nBir Abu Hashim is the well in Wadi Abu Hashim. A bitter well is\r\noften called Bir Murra.[118] A deep well is called _Sararat_ by the\r\nBisharin, _e.g._, Bir Sararat Seyet is the deep well in Wadi Seyet.\r\n\r\nQuestions are often asked as to whether it is not possible to increase\r\nthe available water supplies by sinking fresh wells. Where it is\r\na question of sinking a new well in the middle of a long waterless\r\nstretch, or where the object is to sink a fresh well near an existing\r\nsalty one in order to obtain a drinkable quality of water (and these\r\nare the two most usual cases), success cannot be predicted with any\r\ncertainty, even in the most likely looking spots. We must remember\r\nthat though the present Arabs may be lazy, the older tenants of the\r\ndesert were more active. We have only to look at the old mining\r\ncentres to see this. The probability is that the old miners were\r\njust as much worried by the scarcity of water as we are to-day, and\r\nwith the cheap convict labour then available we may rest assured\r\nthat every attempt was made to increase the supply. And it is not\r\nprobable that the Arabs will have allowed to fall into disuse any\r\nexisting well on an otherwise waterless road, so that it is likely\r\nthat most of the wells in the wadis remote from the mountains are at\r\nspots specially favourable which have been discovered by a laborious\r\nprocess of trial and error. Confirmation of this view is supplied by\r\nthe failure of new wells sunk at considerable cost in likely-looking\r\nplaces, as for instance at Abu Rahal, where a well carried down to\r\nover sixty metres’ depth failed to find water. Where modern wells\r\nhave obtained water, they have usually been sunk near to or on the\r\nsite of existing wells, as for instance near the temple of Seti I\r\nand at the different mining centres; in these cases it has sometimes\r\nbeen found possible to increase the supply by going deeper. And\r\nwith regard to obtaining sweet water by sinking new wells near to\r\nold salty ones, no success can be hoped for if the saltiness is\r\ndue to a general salt-content in the surrounding rocks; the Mines\r\nDepartment well in Wadi Mellaha[119] yielded no better water than\r\nthe Arab well in the same wadi, because the alluvium everywhere\r\nin the wadi contains abundance of salt. In some cases, it may be,\r\nthe promotion of a more rapid flow would lead to a slight lessening\r\nin the salinity; but if a well becomes salt merely by evaporation\r\nresulting from stagnation, that very fact shows that it is not much\r\nused by the ordinary traveller; and moreover the rate of flow of\r\nthe underground water is not as a rule sufficiently rapid to yield\r\nlarge supplies, even from wide excavations.\r\n\r\nIn the south parts of the country, where the rainfall is greater,\r\nit is possible, nay, even likely, that many new wells could be sunk\r\nwith success; but in these localities existing wells are more abundant\r\nand the necessity for new wells does not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =Rock Basins (Galts).=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe typical rock basin, called a _galt_[120] by the Arabs, is a\r\nsmooth-sided cavity in the rocky floor of a steep gorge draining\r\na large mass of high hills. Galts are generally difficult of\r\naccess, being situated in the higher parts of very stony wadis,\r\nso that one has to tramp often over miles of steeply rising stony\r\nground to reach them. Galts abound in all high mountain-masses in\r\nSouth-Eastern Egypt, and furnish the greater portion of the water\r\nsupply of the population. The capacity of galts varies very much;\r\nsome hold millions of litres. Often there is a chain of successive\r\ngalts at intervals along the length of a gorge, and after rain the\r\nwhole series is filled, while much overflows and runs to waste. The\r\norigin of the rocky basins is generally due to pot-holing action on a\r\nlarge scale. Galts may occur in rocks of any hard type, but are most\r\ncommonly met with in eruptive rocks. Sandstone galts never remain\r\nlong full, owing to the permeable nature of the rocks. The large\r\nGalt el Aguz near Gebel Um Harba, which from the inscriptions near\r\nit was evidently known and used in Ptolemaic times, is in sandstone,\r\nreceiving in fact the superficial run-off from the same high mass\r\nof sandstone hills as furnish the collecting area for feeding by\r\npercolation and underground flow the adjacent springs of Bir Abraq\r\nand Abu Saafa; but the galt is seldom full for more than a month or\r\ntwo, while the springs are constant.\r\n\r\nThe water supply of galts depends firstly on the rainfall of the\r\ndistrict; secondly, on the existing drainage system; thirdly, on\r\nthe presence and size of eroded basins along the lines of drainage;\r\nfourthly, on the nature of the rocks forming the basin, and, lastly,\r\non the degree of exposure to evaporation. The rainfall in the Eastern\r\nDesert is often very local. A series of galts full one year may\r\nbe dry the next, while those of another area may show a reverse\r\nstate of things. The drainage system most favourable to galts is\r\none formed by the union of long narrow steep-sided gullies into a\r\nsingle gorge. The presence of basins is conditioned by the steepness\r\nof the drainage and the hardness of the rocky floor; if the rocks\r\nare soft or much crushed, galts are very unlikely to occur. Again,\r\nif the basin is formed of permeable though hard rock, there will be\r\nrapid loss by infiltration. Evaporation is generally far less rapid\r\nat galts than in open country, because being in narrow gorges galts\r\nonly receive the sun’s rays for a few hours of the day, and are,\r\nmoreover, sheltered from winds.\r\n\r\nThe quality of galt water varies very much with the interval since\r\nrainfall and with the nature of the rocks. Sandstone galts are very\r\npure, because of their short life and the siliceous nature of the\r\nrock. Serpentine and diorite galts contain magnesium and other salts,\r\nand as the loss by evaporation continues the water may become somewhat\r\nbitter and purgative by concentration of these saline constituents,\r\nthough galts never suffer to the extent that some wells do in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nA galt is frequently accompanied by a small spring (_megal_ or\r\n_megwel_); the galt represents the run-off, while the spring receives\r\nthe percolating water. Thus for months after a galt is empty it\r\nmay in some cases be possible to obtain water in small quantity by\r\nscooping out sand-filled rock cavities close to the basin.\r\n\r\nGalts are generally named after the mountain in which they occur,\r\nthough when large and well known they may have special names given\r\nto them, as in the case of the Galt el Aguz mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =Remarks on Water Transport.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAs will be gathered from the map on Plate III, water supplies are\r\nseldom more than two days’ march apart in this part of Egypt. For\r\nthe ordinary traveller it will therefore be usually an ample provision\r\nto carry four days’ supply; in special cases, where it is desired\r\nto camp for any purpose remote from water sources, special provision\r\nwill of course have to be made. There is seldom any trouble with the\r\nArabs about their own water, as when their supplies run short one\r\nor two camels can always be detached from a caravan to fill their\r\nskins from the nearest well, and they are always content to travel\r\nday and night for this purpose. With regard to the quantity of water\r\nto be carried, I found ten gallons per European per day to be ample,\r\nincluding water for cooking and for one’s personal servants. Water\r\nis best carried in rectangular galvanized iron tanks, each holding\r\nten gallons, fitted with a good brass or wooden plug; two of these\r\ncarried horizontally make a light camel load, and on the march one\r\ncan add a little in the shape of tents or bedding to the load. I\r\nhave tried the barrel-shaped galvanised steel tanks used by the\r\nmining companies, which hold sixteen gallons each and are easily\r\ncarried vertically, a pair forming a camel load; but I have found\r\nthem much more liable to damage than the smaller rectangular tanks,\r\nand do not recommend them for regular desert travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =List of Water Sources.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following list I have summarized all the water sources known\r\nto me in order of latitude from north to south. I believe the list\r\ncontains all sources that are of importance, but it is doubtless far\r\nfrom being complete as regards the rock basins of the mountain areas\r\nfor two reasons. Firstly, the Arabs are often reluctant to point out\r\nthe sources, more especially in the more arid parts of the Ababda\r\ncountry; and secondly, as already remarked, since the rock basins\r\ndepend for their supplies entirely on comparatively recent rainfall\r\naround them, they vary very much in yield in different years, so\r\nthat basins which are of great use in one year may be totally dry\r\nthe next, and _vice-versa_, and guides seldom take the trouble to\r\npoint out a dry basin, even if in some other year it may have held\r\na useful store of water.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the accuracy of the positions given in the list, it may\r\nbe remarked that in the case of wells actually visited the position\r\nis given to seconds, and the localisation may be relied on within\r\nat most a few hundred metres; while for wells not actually seen but\r\nwhose positions were pointed out by guides from some distance, the\r\ncoordinates are usually only given to minutes, and these positions\r\nare uncertain by larger amounts, up to two or three kilometres in\r\nextreme cases.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that water supplies can _always_ be obtained\r\nat all the localities named. As already remarked, rock basins will\r\nusually only be full if rain has fallen in the district comparatively\r\nrecently, large rock basins may furnish supplies for a year after\r\nrainfall, but the smaller ones last only a few months, weeks, or\r\neven days. The reserves are the wells, most of which never run dry\r\nexcept after a succession of rainless years. But when rock basins\r\nare full, many of the wells are filled with downwash, and digging\r\nmust be resorted to in order to re-open them. A traveller arriving\r\nat a “well” sometimes finds no evidence whatever of its existence\r\nbeyond the guides pointing to a spot on the ground with the statement\r\n“_el bir hena_” (the well is here). The explanation is that the\r\nwell has been filled with alluvial matter washed down the valley by\r\nrecent rain; but that same rainfall will have filled the rock basins\r\nin the hills, and the Arabs leave the digging out of the well until\r\nthe basins are empty again. In other cases a well may be found to\r\nbe dry through the water-level having sunk below the depth to which\r\nthe well was last opened, and by deepening it a foot or so one may\r\nobtain a supply.\r\n\r\nThe notes in the column headed “Remarks,” on the quality of the\r\nwater of the various sources, are mostly based on the observations\r\nof a single year, and must therefore only be taken as general\r\nguides. Usually, the shorter the interval since rain has fallen,\r\nthe better are the supplies, both in quantity and quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LIST OF WATER SOURCES.[121]\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+--------+---------+--------------------------\r\n           Name.         |Latitude|Longitude|        Remarks.\r\n                         |   N.   |   E.    |\r\n  -----------------------+--------+---------+--------------------------\r\n                         | °  ′  ″| °  ′  ″ |\r\n                         |        |         |\r\n   Galt Um Tundeba       |24 55 25|34 45 53 |Rock basin in ravine, 1\r\n                         |        |         |kilometre from Wadi Um\r\n                         |        |         |Tundeba.

As will be seen from a glance at the geological\r\nmap on Plate XX, sedimentary strata are to be found only in the\r\nnorth-western and central portions of the area, where the Nubian\r\nsandstone which covers so much of the country close east of the\r\nNile terminates in a long south-easterly projection, and along\r\ncertain portions of the coast, where small outliers of Nubian\r\nsandstone and patches and strips of gypseous limestones and coral\r\nreef occur. The oldest rocks of undoubted sedimentary origin, the\r\nNubian sandstones, are of Cretaceous age. Tertiary beds are absent,\r\nexcept for the gypseous strata of Ras Benas, which may possibly be\r\nMiocene. Quaternary deposits are represented by Pleistocene and\r\nRecent coral reefs and beach deposits, and by accumulations of\r\nalluvial downwash, blown sand, and calcareous tufa.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary deposits may thus be classified into:—\r\n\r\n(1) _Recent Deposits_ (coral reefs and raised beaches, blown sand,\r\nalluvial deposits, and calcareous tufa).\r\n\r\n(2) _Gypsum and Gypseous Limestones_ (of uncertain age, possibly\r\nMiocene).\r\n\r\n(3) _Nubian Sandstone_ (Cretaceous).\r\n\r\n\r\n                   =Coral Reefs and Raised Beaches.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCoral reefs fringe almost the entire coast-line of South-Eastern\r\nEgypt, rendering the coast one of the foulest in the world for\r\nshipping. Coral forms the islands of Wadi Gemal, Gulhan, Mukawar,\r\nMirear, Seyal, and Halaib, these rising to a few metres above the\r\nsea; but in general it is not met with on the main land except close\r\nto the shore. The reefs may extend, slightly raised, some distance\r\ninland, but cannot be seen owing to the sand and downwash from the\r\nmountains which covers the sloping coast-plain. At low water great\r\nexpanses of nearly level coral reef, stretching out for a kilometre\r\nor more from the shore, are exposed in places, especially near Ras\r\nBenas. Frequently a line of reefs can be seen running for many miles\r\nparallel to the coast at a distance of a kilometre or more from it;\r\nthese outer reefs can be traced in windy weather by the breaking\r\nof waves on them, and in calm weather by the lighter colour of the\r\nwater over them. There is frequently deep water between the outer\r\nreefs and the shore. Openings in the outer reefs, through which boats\r\ncan pass into the sheltered water within, are called _mersas_ by the\r\nArab boatmen; they frequently occur opposite the mouths of the larger\r\nwadis. Coral reef forms a tough, hard, and very porous limestone, with\r\nan extremely rough surface on which the structure of the astraean and\r\nother corals composing it can be clearly seen. It has been used for\r\nbuilding the jetty at Halaib, and rough blocks of it were anciently\r\nemployed for building at Berenice, as well as in the tombs at Suakin\r\nel Qadim; but its porosity and intractability would never recommend\r\nit as a building stone if any other could be found locally.\r\n\r\nIn close association with coral reefs are beach deposits of\r\nPleistocene age. These occur round the hills near the tip and on the\r\nnorth side of the peninsula of Ras Benas, where they cover the slopes\r\nof the gypseous limestone hills. Low hills and banks of very white\r\naspect occur near the sea further north; these are probably also\r\nraised beaches, though they have not been visited and may possibly\r\nbe gypsum. Near the tip of Ras Benas these beach deposits are gritty\r\nlimestones with abundant casts of lamellibranchs and gasteropods,\r\nmostly in bad preservation, as well as various echinoids, among\r\nwhich M. Fourtau has identified the species _Brissus carinatus_\r\nas one of the most abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Blown Sand.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dune-forming sand in South-Eastern Egypt is exactly similar to\r\nthat which covers such large areas in the Libyan Desert. It consists\r\nof well-rounded quartz grains, averaging about a millimetre in\r\ndiameter; the grains are usually of a golden-yellow colour, owing\r\nto their being coated with a thin superficial film of iron oxide.\r\n\r\nThe only area where sand dunes are of any considerable magnitude\r\nor extent in South-Eastern Egypt is the tract called I Hubâl\r\n(lit. “the sand dunes”) which extends from Wadi Meisah to\r\nWadi Aideib, fronting the hills of Ti Keferiai, Geror, Balatitda,\r\nSul Hamid, and El Sela. The north faces of all these hills and the\r\nsmaller hills north of them are swathed in thickly accumulated sand\r\nto such an extent as to make travelling over them difficult. The\r\nreason for the heavy sand accumulation at this particular place is\r\nthat the north-west wind, which is the prevalent wind over Egypt\r\nproper, here meets with south-easterly winds coming up the Red Sea,\r\ncausing a local calm and a consequent dropping of the sand borne\r\nfrom the Nubian sandstone areas by the north-west wind. Thus the\r\nsame climatic conditions which give rise to the rich vegetation on\r\nthe Elba mountains cause at the same time extreme desert conditions\r\nin the tract immediately north-west of them.\r\n\r\nSand accumulations of less magnitude occur in and about the lower\r\nreaches of the Wadi Hodein, in the great valley to the north of\r\nBerenice, on the plain west of Gebel Um Harba, and at some few\r\nother places, but they are seldom so extensive as to cause a serious\r\nhindrance to travel.\r\n\r\nBesides transporting the ordinary dune-forming sand, the action of\r\nthe wind is responsible for a considerable amount of redistribution\r\nof the coarser granitic and other sand produced by the disintegration\r\nof igneous rocks. In high winds this coarse sand, in angular grains\r\nas large as peas, is blown about on the coast-plain to considerable\r\ndistances from the places where it was originally deposited by\r\nwater transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Alluvial Deposits.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe degradation of the mountain and hill masses which is constantly\r\ngoing on under sub-aerial agencies (disintegration by variations of\r\ntemperature, and transport by water during occasional rain storms)\r\nhas in the course of centuries resulted in immense accumulations of\r\nalluvial material (sand and gravel) along all the drainage lines and\r\non the plains. Disintegration is in many places greatly facilitated\r\nby the crushed nature of the rocks, due to the tectonic movements\r\nwhich they have suffered during the process of folding and mountain\r\nformation. This fact is specially evident in the case of the more\r\nbasic rocks. Serpentines, for instance, are frequently so crushed\r\nand cracked that one may search in vain over a whole mountain for a\r\nplace where the rock is sufficiently free from cracks to allow of a\r\nhand-specimen of the ordinary size being extracted without breaking\r\nup into fragments under the hammer. In the more acid rocks, like the\r\ngranites, crushing has been a less powerful aid to disintegration,\r\nand here the diurnal temperature-range has been the principal factor;\r\nthe rock, being an aggregate of crystals of different materials with\r\ndifferent coefficients of expansion, has been easily broken up at its\r\nsurface by the constant differential motion of its component grains,\r\nresulting in the formation of coarse granitic sand. Chemical action in\r\ndenudation is of quite subordinate importance. Though some chemical\r\naction has taken place, as for instance in the kaolinisation of the\r\nfelspars, we find as a rule that the alluvial accumulations consist\r\nprincipally of unaltered rock fragments.\r\n\r\nIn material, the alluvial accumulations are of the same varied\r\nnature as the mountains from whose degradation they have originated,\r\nranging from very basic mineral substances, such as serpentine,\r\nto the most acid, such as quartz. The relative proportions of\r\nthe different materials in the alluvial deposits do not, however,\r\ncorrespond as a rule with the proportions in which they enter into the\r\nmountain masses. Not only are heterogeneous rocks, such as granites\r\nand diorites, far more rapidly disintegrated by temperature-changes\r\nthan are the more homogeneous rocks such as felsites and serpentines,\r\nbut the fragments produced by the disintegration of granitic rocks are\r\nrounder and of much smaller size than the fragments resulting from\r\nthe breaking up of felsites, schists, and serpentines. The result\r\nis that granitic detritus is transported to greater distances and\r\ndistributed over larger areas than the detritus of the closer-grained\r\nand more homogeneous rocks. In approaching a mountain composed of\r\nabout equal parts of, say, granite and serpentine, we accordingly\r\nfind the lower portions of the wadi consist chiefly of granitic sand,\r\nwhile the coarser and more angular detritus of serpentine is only seen\r\nin abundance in the higher parts of the drainage channel. The nature\r\nof the alluvium of the wadi floor occasionally gives its name to the\r\nwadi; thus, of the two wadis which by their junction form Wadi Khoda,\r\none is called Wadi Salib el Azrak, because its alluvium consists of\r\ndark rock fragments, while the other is called Wadi Salib el Abiad,\r\nbecause its floor is formed of white granitic sand. (_Azrak_ = dark;\r\n_Abiad_ = white).\r\n\r\nIn size, the fragments composing alluvial detritus vary from huge\r\nblocks weighing tons down to the finest sand whose grains are only\r\na fraction of a millimetre in diameter. As a rule, of course, the\r\nlarger fragments are found near the heads of wadis, and the finer\r\nsands in their lower reaches and on the plains. But often we find\r\ngreat boulders mixed with the sand at immense distances from the\r\nparent mountain mass; the heavier rain storms which occasionally\r\nbreak over the mountains produce for short periods such immense\r\nrushes of water down the wadis, that great boulders are swept along\r\nand incorporated in the finer material which is deposited in times\r\nof more normal rainfall. Thus it is no uncommon thing in sinking\r\na well in a wadi fifty kilometres or more from the mountains to\r\nencounter great boulders in the sandy alluvium.\r\n\r\nIn shape, the alluvial fragments vary very much, according to\r\ntheir mineral nature and the amount of rolling they have received\r\nin transport. Foliated rocks, like schists and slates, produce\r\ntypically flaky fragments which seldom attain any high degree of\r\nrounding; the same is true of serpentines which have been shattered\r\nby crushing. Granitic rocks produce generally more symmetrical\r\nfragments, though granitic sand is typically angular unless it has\r\nbeen transported for considerable distances. The larger blocks are\r\ngenerally rounded in the case of granitic rocks, even when they\r\nhave not travelled for any great distance; for if a cubical block\r\nof granite be exposed to weathering, disintegration takes place\r\nmost rapidly at the corners, and the block eventually becomes\r\nmore or less spheroidal without having moved at all. This can be\r\nwell seen in such masses as Gebel Selaia, where the granite boss\r\nis thoroughly well rounded _in situ_. The same phenomenon can be\r\nnoticed in certain dolerites, where portions of the rock detached\r\nby joint planes have weathered _in situ_ into forms like cannon\r\nballs. The more homogeneous rocks like felsite and serpentine,\r\nas well as the foliated rocks like gneisses, schists, and slates,\r\ndo not show much of this rounding _in situ_, as they yield to the\r\nstresses of expansion and contraction by breaking along planes of\r\ncrushing or foliation, producing separate masses which preserve most\r\nof their angular shape. In the lower reaches of the wadis and on the\r\nplains, of course, all the materials are more or less rounded, owing\r\nto the attrition to which they have been subjected during transport.\r\n\r\nOf the thickness of the alluvial sands and gravels very little is\r\nknown. But that it exceeds eight metres in many of the wadis is\r\nproved by wells sunk to that depth. On the coast-plain it may be\r\nvastly thicker, for Grabham[122] mentions that borings made in the\r\nmaritime plain near Port Sudan have been carried down to 1,000 feet\r\n(305 metres) in the deposits. Only a very small proportion of the\r\nalluvial detritus brought down the wadis enters either the sea or the\r\nNile; for the storm-formed streams, though violent in the mountainous\r\ntracts, commonly cease by being absorbed in the thirsty wadi floors\r\nand plains before reaching either the sea or the river. Bearing this\r\nin mind, and the ages through which the actions of denudation and\r\ntransport have gone on, we can well imagine how great must be the\r\ntotal quantity of detritus accumulated.\r\n\r\nIn some wadis there are high banks of old detritus through which the\r\nstreams have cut their way. In the Wadi Meneiga, for instance, there\r\nare terraces of alluvium, some eight or ten metres high, on either\r\nside of the present water channel; these terraces, which are about\r\ntwo kilometres lower down the wadi than the wells, are covered with\r\nrude rubble ruins, the remains of dwellings erected out of reach of\r\nthe occasional streams which rush down the wadi after rain.\r\n\r\nAt the east foot of Gebel Hamra Dom are some well stratified friable\r\nsand rocks and sandy clays, about ten metres thick, ending abruptly\r\nagainst the granites and schists of the hill-mass. These beds appear\r\nto be ancient alluvial deposits. They contain ferruginous scales and\r\nshow sun-cracks in places, while the materials are finer and more\r\ndistinctly stratified than one would expect to be brought down from\r\nthe mountain under present conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is to the alluvial material in the wadis that the Eastern Desert\r\nowes most of its perennial water supplies and the vegetation\r\nit possesses. The alluvial deposits are the great conservers of\r\nwater. Pools form, it is true, in the bare rocky beds of the higher\r\ndrainage lines, and may last for many months where they are screened\r\nby the walls of a gorge from wind and sun, and are in consequence not\r\nsubject to rapid evaporation. But such pools are difficult of access,\r\nand afford but a precarious source of water supply because they are\r\nliable to dry up if a long period passes without rain. The alluvium\r\nof the wadis absorbs the rainfall and protects it from evaporation,\r\nso that even in very dry years water may be found by excavating in it\r\nat suitable places to depths of a few metres. Almost all the wells\r\nwhich are so important to travellers crossing the desert from the\r\nNile are of this character. The abundance of trees which flourish\r\nin so many of the wadis likewise derive their nourishment from the\r\nwater conserved in the alluvium of the wadi floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Calcareous Tufa.=\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall deposits of calcareous tufa of recent origin have been noted in\r\nthe Wadi Um Tundeba and in a gorge on the east side of Gebel Ghuel,\r\nas well as round the little trickling spring called Megwel Hamida\r\nin the south part of the region.\r\n\r\nAt Um Tundeba the deposit occurs in a little gully close to a well\r\nknown _galt_ or pool of rain water. The deposit is not extensive,\r\nand has doubtless been formed by the evaporation of trickling\r\ndrainage-water which had absorbed lime from the rocks. The tufa\r\n(10,374) is a pale brown rock of rather porous nature; it envelops\r\nfragments of schist-debris from the surrounding rocks.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous tufa of Gebel Ghuel is a more impressive deposit,\r\nthough its total mass is not very great. It occurs at a point of\r\nsudden fall in a narrow rocky gorge leading to the Wadi Ghadir in\r\nabout latitude 22° 53′. Proceeding up the gully one is confronted\r\nwith a great curtain-like mass of tufa covering the face of a high\r\nledge like a solidified cascade. Here also the origin is clearly due\r\nto trickling of lime-laden drainage-waters over the ledge of rock,\r\nwhich forms a step in the wadi floor.\r\n\r\nFragments of tufa were also seen round about Gebel Allawi, though\r\nthe rock was not traced to its source. As only a relatively small\r\nnumber of rocky gullies have been explored, it is likely that similar\r\ndeposits to those above described occur in many other places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   =Gypsum and Gypseous Limestones.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occurrences of gypsum and gypseous limestone beds in South-Eastern\r\nEgypt are restricted to the coastal regions. The most prominent of the\r\ndeposits are those on Ras Benas (_see_ map on Plate XXI), where the\r\nbeds form white hills rising to 188 metres above sea-level. Further\r\nnorth, gypseous deposits have been found by Dr. Hume to exist near\r\nthe sea at Bir el Ranga, and by Mr. Ferrar the same beds have been\r\nrecorded as occurring near the coast in the neighbourhood of Wadi\r\nIgli. It appears probable that the gypseous strata form a continuous\r\nor nearly continuous strip extending along the coast down to latitude\r\n24° 22′, as shown on the geological map on Plate XX, but more\r\ncomplete observations may show that the distribution of the beds is\r\nsomewhat different from that indicated. On the coast-plain south\r\nof Ras Benas, gypseous beds are not exposed except in the extreme\r\nsouth-east corner of Egypt, where they form small patches at Halaib\r\nand round the wells of Ti Kureitra.\r\n\r\nAt Ras Benas, where the beds have been studied in most detail,\r\nthey consist of gypsum and anhydrite [11,513][123] alternating with\r\nsandy marls and marly sands, forming hills much cut-up by steep sided\r\nnarrow ravines. The weathered faces of the rocks are very soft, and\r\nthe disintegrated material forms a stretch of soft gypseous sand,\r\ninto which one’s feet sink four or five centimetres at every step,\r\nbetween the hills and the shore. At Halaib, gypseous limestones crop\r\nout from under the gravel of the coast-plain and form low banks;\r\nthe gypsum is here associated with calcareous grits [12,152, 12,114]\r\nand conglomerates, the latter having boulders of igneous rock set\r\nin a calcareous matrix. Near Ti Kureitra wells, the gypsum exposures\r\ncontain much crystalline selenite, blocks of this material being used\r\nin the masonry lining of the wells. Both at Bir el Ranga and on Ras\r\nBenas the gypsum is found to contain small pockets of native sulphur.\r\n\r\nNo fossils have been found in the gypseous strata, and their\r\ngeological age is uncertain. The beds are younger than the Nubian\r\nsandstone, since they overlie that formation at Bir el Ranga. Their\r\noccurrence only near the coast leads one to regard them as having been\r\nformed after the Red Sea occupied its present position; but whether\r\nthey originated as direct gypseous deposits, or were produced by\r\nthe alteration of pre-existent Cretaceous or Tertiary limestones is\r\nnot yet quite certain. It is noteworthy that at Ras Benas, where the\r\ngypseous strata rest on diorite and hornblende granite, the igneous\r\nrocks are considerably altered as if by weathering, with a strong\r\nbrick-red colour due to the oxidation of ferruginous matter.\r\n\r\n                                                            PLATE XXI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOLOGICAL MAP OF RAS BENAS\r\n\r\nBall. Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Metal-Process. Survey Dept. Cairo 1910. (60-190)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =The Nubian Sandstone.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nubian sandstone covers a comparatively small portion of\r\nSouth-Eastern Egypt, occupying only about one-tenth of the total area\r\nunder consideration. The greater portion of it forms the eastern\r\ntermination of the vast sandstone plateaux which stretch eastward\r\nfrom the Nile towards the igneous and metamorphic back-bone of the\r\nRed Sea mountains, but there are in addition some small patches on\r\nthe eastern side of the watershed which are interesting as showing\r\nthat the deposition of the sandstone was not confined to the western\r\nside of the mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nThe most northerly exposure of Nubian sandstone in the district\r\nhere described extends with some breaks southward from near Gebel\r\nSufra to near Gebel Homr Akarim, forming low hills. Further south,\r\nit comes in again on both sides of the Wadi Garara, forming the hills\r\nof Felieiti and Abu Hashim. In the sandy plain around the Wadi Timsah\r\nare outlying sandstone hills of considerable height and extent,\r\nthe principal being Gebels Nuggur, Mulgata, and Ziraga. Further\r\nsouth-west, the Nubian sandstone forms an extensive high broken\r\nplateau stretching southward from near Gebel Zergat Naam to near\r\nGebel Um Reit, sending out a long tongue south-eastwards across Wadi\r\nDif to near Gebel Nigrub el Tahtani. This tract of broken sandstone\r\nplateaux bears various names in different parts, Gebels Um Harba, Um\r\nKhafur, Dagalai, Shebakhit, Awamtib, Um Sididad, Abraq, Hodein, Dif,\r\nAnfeib, and Kala, all forming parts of the same great sandstone mass,\r\nthough separated by wadis from each other. Small outliers of Nubian\r\nsandstone cap the hills of Gebels Reietit, just north of latitude\r\n23°, near the meridian of 34°, and Gebel Seiga, in latitude 22°\r\n44′, longitude 34° 16′.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the watershed, Nubian sandstone extends\r\nfor some distance near the coast opposite the Gulhan islands, and\r\nalso forms small thin outliers south of the Wadi Hodein. The most\r\nsoutherly point where the sandstone has been met with in the area\r\nis a small outlier in latitude 22° 36′, a few kilometres east of\r\nGebel Hamra Dom.\r\n\r\nIn petrographical characters the Nubian sandstone is remarkably\r\nuniform, consisting of medium-sized silica grains set in a more\r\nor less ferruginous cement; the colour varies from nearly white,\r\nthrough various shades of brown, to nearly black, according to the\r\namount of iron present. It is generally well bedded, and frequently\r\nmuch jointed. There is usually a marked absence of the clay beds\r\nwhich are associated with the Nubian sandstone in other parts of\r\nEgypt. The basal beds are generally pebbly, forming conglomerates in\r\nsome places. Concretions are found in the rock at some points, notably\r\nto the north of Gebel Um Harba. Some of the concretions are hollow,\r\nthe shell being of hard dark ferruginous sandstone while the interior\r\nis filled with a powder of snow-white chalky matter containing sand\r\ngrains. The only fossils observed in the sandstone within the area\r\ndescribed were collected by Mr. Charteris Stewart in the plain of\r\nUm Harba; they consist of crocodile scales and various shells. From\r\nthese and the fossil shells found further west in sinking a well in\r\nWadi Abu Rahal,[124] it may be concluded that the Nubian sandstone\r\nhere, as in the Nile Valley, is of Cretaceous age.\r\n\r\nIntrusions of igneous rock into the sandstone have only been observed\r\nat two points in the area, _viz._, near the western foot of Gebel\r\nAwamtib, where a basic dyke runs through the sandstone, and on the\r\nRed Sea coast, near Bir el Ranga, where Dr. Hume has found andesite\r\ninterbedded in the sandstone. A bed of diabase, now much altered,\r\nunderlies the sandstone near Wadi Muelih, and is possibly of\r\ncontemporaneous origin.\r\n\r\nIn thickness, the Nubian sandstone attains a maximum of about\r\n350 metres in several places round about Bir Abraq and the Wadi\r\nHodein. Its thickness must at one time have exceeded this, for the\r\nupper surfaces have suffered much denudation, and are not capped by\r\nyounger rocks.\r\n\r\nSome interest attaches to the maximum altitude reached by the Nubian\r\nsandstone beds. The highest point at which it has been observed is at\r\nGebel Seiga, whose sandstone cap is 905 metres above sea-level. The\r\nhighest point reached by the rock on the great plateau round about\r\nWadi Hodein is Gebel Kala, 846 metres above sea.\r\n\r\nIn contradistinction to the same beds which form the plateau between\r\nlongitude 34° and the Nile, the Nubian sandstones within the area\r\nhere described show considerable disturbances from their original\r\nhorizontal bedding, the dips being as a rule greater and more variable\r\nthe nearer one approaches to the watershed mountain-ranges. These\r\ntectonic disturbances, which are important in connexion with the\r\ngeological history of the region, will be considered in Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: _Geol.

I visited the well in May 1906, when it had attained\r\na depth of fifty-four metres. The strata passed through were ten\r\nmetres alluvium, then thirty-seven metres of sandstones and clays,\r\nfollowed by a thin band of bituminous shale, and seven metres of\r\ndark grey clays.

Intermediate types occur, as well as ultra-acid and\r\nultra-basic rocks, but these are less abundant, and are generally\r\nfound in close association with one or other of the two main\r\ntypes. Rocks of the acid type predominate to the north of latitude\r\n24°, while further south basic rocks form large portions of the main\r\nmountain tracts, with acid rocks at intervals on either side down to\r\nthe Sudan frontier. Most of the igneous rocks are plutonic. There\r\nis a striking paucity of volcanic rocks, a circumstance doubtless\r\nto be ascribed largely to the enormous denudation which has taken\r\nplace in the district. The plutonic masses, with the dykes seaming\r\nthem, have been elevated and laid bare, while most of the volcanic\r\noutpourings have been denuded away and others have been altered\r\nor devitrified till their original volcanic nature has become less\r\napparent. Metamorphism has also affected many of the plutonic masses\r\nto such a degree that it is often difficult to decide whether the\r\nrocks should now be placed in the igneous group, or classed as\r\nmetamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of classification, the igneous rocks of\r\nSouth-Eastern Egypt may be divided into five main groups, based\r\non silica-percentage:—\r\n\r\n1. _Ultra-acid rocks_, containing over 80 per cent of silica.\r\n\r\n2. _Acid rocks_, containing from 65 to 80 per cent of silica.\r\n\r\n3. _Intermediate rocks_:—\r\n\r\n  (_a_) _Sub-acid rocks_, with from 60 to 65 per cent of silica.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) _Sub-basic rocks_, with from 55 to 60 per cent of silica.\r\n\r\n4. _Basic rocks_, containing from 45 to 55 per cent of silica.\r\n\r\n5. _Ultra-basic rocks_, with less than 45 per cent of silica.\r\n\r\nThe classification is based on silica percentage, for although\r\nup to the present it has not been found possible to undertake the\r\nchemical analysis of the rocks, the microscopic examination of thin\r\nsections itself gives a very fair guide to the chemical composition,\r\nand the specific gravities of the different rocks, which increase\r\nprogressively from the acid to basic groups, afford a further guide\r\nin this direction. The table on the following page shows the different\r\nrocks comprised within the five main classes.\r\n\r\nThe five classes are not all of equal importance. As already\r\nmentioned, the acid and basic types are predominant. The ultra-acid\r\nand sub-acid rocks are present in relatively small quantity, and are\r\nin close relationship with those of the acid series which occur in\r\ngreat abundance; the rocks of the sub-basic and ultra-basic groups,\r\non the other hand, though by no means insignificant in their\r\ndistribution (diorites and serpentines cover very large areas),\r\nappear to be closely linked in the field with those of the basic\r\ngroup. The district is so large, and the investigation of it has been\r\nso limited, that it would be unwise to draw from the above remarks\r\nthe deduction that the rocks have originated from two main magmas;\r\nthe statements are merely those of the facts of observation, so far\r\nas observation has proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe scheme tabulated above differs from established classifications\r\nonly in the inclusion of an _ultra-acid_ class of rocks. This\r\ninclusion is necessitated by the presence in the district of\r\nhuge masses of quartz-rocks which are almost certainly igneous\r\nin origin. These rocks are almost pure silica, and though they\r\nare properly regarded as an extreme form of pegmatite, their\r\nsilica-percentage (over 95) is too high for them to be placed with\r\ntheir near relations the granites; and on grounds of symmetry of\r\nclassification it appears justifiable to have an “ultra-acid”\r\nclass corresponding with that of ultra-basic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CLASSIFICATION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n  --------+------------+-----------------------+-----------+--------------\r\n          |            |     Intermediate.     |           |\r\n   Ultra- |    Acid.   |                       |   Basic.  | Ultra-basic.\r\n   acid.  |            +----------+------------+           |\r\n          |            | Sub-acid.| Sub-basic. |           |\r\n  --------+------------+----------+------------+-----------+--------------\r\n  _Quartz-|_Granite_   |_Syenite_ |_Diorite_   |_Gabbro_   |_Pyroxenite_\r\n  rock_   |            |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          | Normal pink|          | Augite-    | Troctolite|_Amphibolite_\r\n          | granite    |          | diorite    |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          | Red        |          | Mica-      | Pyroxene- |_Peridotite_\r\n          | pegmatitic |          | diorite    | granulite |\r\n          | granite    |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          | Aplite     |          |            |           |_(Serpentine)_\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          | Biotite-   |          |            |           |\r\n          | granite    |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          | Muscovite- |          |            |           |\r\n          | granite    |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          | Hornblende-|          |            |           |\r\n          | granite    |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          |_Granite-   |_Syenite- |_Diorite-   |_Diabase_  |\r\n          |porphyry_   |porphyry_ |porphyrite_ |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          | Augite-    | Mica-     |\r\n          |            |          | porphyrite | diabase   |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          | Kersantite |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          |            |          |            |           |\r\n          |_Quartz-    |_Trachyte_|_Andesite_  |_Basalt_   |\r\n          |felsite_    |          |            |           |\r\n  --------+------------+----------+------------+-----------+--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ULTRA-ACID ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quartz-rock= of igneous origin occurs in the form of intrusive\r\nbosses and veins penetrating older igneous and metamorphic rocks\r\nat Marwot Elemikan and elsewhere. The rock is practically pure\r\nvitreous quartz. Its dazzling white aspect in the sun renders it very\r\nconspicuous in the field. The shape of many of the masses (bosses),\r\ntheir close association with pegmatite and aplite in at least one\r\nlocality, the absence from the veins of other minerals (calcite and\r\nvarious ores) such as usually accompany vein-quartz deposited from\r\nsolution, and the occasional presence in the rock of mica flakes,\r\nall point to an igneous origin, and justify us in regarding this\r\nquartz-rock as the final product of differentiation of a granitic\r\nmagma, representing its ultra-acid portion.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous occurrence of quartz-rock is in the three\r\nnearly conical hills called Marwot[125] Elemikan, which rise from the\r\ngranitic plain at the head of Wadi Elemikan in latitude 23° 53′,\r\nand which from their snow-white colour form landmarks visible from\r\ngreat distances. The largest and most northerly hill of the three is\r\na boss about 300 metres in diameter, rising sixty-eight metres above\r\nthe plain, which itself has here an altitude of 580 metres above\r\nsea. The other two hills are somewhat smaller; they lie respectively\r\ntwo kilometres south-east, and two and half kilometres south, of the\r\nlargest one; a black hill of about equal size rises from the plain\r\nmid-way between them. The highest of the three white hills, which was\r\noccupied as a triangulation station, is composed almost entirely of\r\nglassy quartz, the only other mineral seen in it being a white mica,\r\nof which a few flakes were visible in the outer portions. The mass\r\nis cracked in all directions, and the faces of the separated blocks\r\nfrequently show a slight yellowish staining.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable boss of quartz, similar to that just described\r\nand likewise rising through granite, occurs on the south side of the\r\nWadi Khoda (latitude 23° 42′) about seven kilometres above the\r\npoint where the wadi emerges from the hills on to the coast-plain. A\r\nthird occurrence, of much less size, in the floor of Wadi Abu Marwa,\r\non the track from Wadi Lahami to Berenice _via_ the Wadi Naait;\r\nthe first-mentioned wadi derives its name from the quartz occurrence\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nOf igneous quartz veins, the best example is the huge dyke which forms\r\nthe back-bone of the ridge called Erf el Fahid, in latitude 25°\r\n0′. Here the vein, which strikes east and west, is in schistose\r\ncountry. It is at least ten metres wide, rising to a height of\r\nninety-five metres above the wadi, and can be traced for a length of\r\nnearly two kilometres. Like the rock of Marwot Elemikan, the quartz\r\nof Erf el Fahid shows faint iron-staining in places, but appears to\r\ncontain no other minerals. It is weathered to a sintery appearance\r\nin places [10,362],[126] and contains some cavities, from one of\r\nwhich I extracted a handful of loose quartz crystals [10,363] with\r\npyramids developed at both ends; these last are evidently deposited\r\nfrom solution, but it is difficult to assign other than an igneous\r\nsource for the vein, and the cavities and loose crystals are probably\r\nthe product of solution subsequent to the igneous intrusion.\r\n\r\nGoing south-west from Erf el Fahid, down the Wadi Muelih, is\r\nanother line of ridges, of which the back-bone is a great quartz vein\r\ntraceable for some two and a half kilometres along its strike. Further\r\ndown the wadi are networks of quartz veins seaming diorite in all\r\ndirections on either side of a horse-shoe-shaped hill called Marwot\r\nRod el Ligaia; this hill is of aplite, and probably represents a\r\nless acid part of the same magma which formed the quartz veins.[127]\r\n\r\nIt is significant that there are no traces of mine workings at any of\r\nthe places where quartz veins and bosses of the igneous type occur,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the masses are so conspicuous as to have\r\nsurely attracted the eye of every gold-seeking prospector. Though\r\nthe loose crystals found at Erf el Fahid show that there at least\r\naqueous solutions have acted on the rock to a slight extent, these\r\ngreat igneous quartz masses appear never to have been impregnated\r\nwith gold or other ores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ACID IGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n                              =Granites.=\r\n\r\n\r\nGranites are the most abundant and most widely distributed of the\r\nigneous rocks of South-Eastern Egypt. They form a large proportion\r\nof the most prominent mountain masses, such as Gebels Hamrat Wogud,\r\nNugrus, Hamrat Mukbud, Hamata, Faraid, Um Reit, Mishbih, Adar Qaqa,\r\nAdar Aweib, and Elba. They also occur in some great plain tracts,\r\nsuch as those round Gebel Selaia and to the west of Gebel Um Reit,\r\nwhere low hills of the rock rise through the coarse granitic sand\r\nwhich covers most of the plain.\r\n\r\nIn point of geological age, the granites appear to be the youngest\r\nof the plutonic rocks of the country, forming great intrusions in\r\nthe more ancient schists and diorites.\r\n\r\nThough sometimes occurring as rounded bosses, as at Gebels Muelih,\r\nSelaia, and Faraid, granite typically forms rather jagged mountains,\r\nmore especially in the south parts of the area; the mountains of\r\nMishbih and Elba, for instance, abound in spiky peaks, while Qash\r\nAmir, the “Scragged Hill” of the Admiralty Chart, is an extreme\r\nexample of this mode of weathering. The spikes are often made up\r\nof more or less rounded blocks piled one on another, the separation\r\nand rounding of the blocks being brought about by jointing and the\r\nmore rapid weathering of the corners of the separated masses. Granite\r\nmountains, though sometimes white, are usually of a pink or red colour\r\nand are often named accordingly by the Arabs. In Ababda country, all\r\nmountains named _Hamrat_, as for instance Hamrat Wogud and Hamrat\r\nMukbud, are composed of red granite or granitoid gneiss; while in\r\nBisharin country the corresponding name _Adar_, as used for example in\r\nAdar Qaqa and Adar Aweib, has the same significance, both the names\r\nmeaning _red_. The beds of wadis draining from granitic mountains,\r\nand plains adjacent to them, are invariably covered with a thick\r\naccumulation of coarse felspathic and quartzose sand derived from the\r\nweathering of the rock. This sand is quite firm to walk on, and in\r\nthis respect forms a pleasing contrast to the finer wind-borne sand\r\nderived from the disintegration of sandstone. The granitic sand being\r\ngenerally white in colour (the redness of the felspars having largely\r\ndisappeared in the process of weathering), the wadis in whose floors\r\nit is largely displayed are frequently named “Wadi el Abiad”\r\n(_abiad_ = white); there are numerous wadis called by this name,\r\nall possessing the common characteristic of draining from granitic\r\nmountains and consequently having a floor of granitic sand.\r\n\r\nBesides the great mountain-forming masses, granites also occur\r\nfrequently in the form of dykes or veins, penetrating the gneisses,\r\nschists, and other rocks.\r\n\r\nViewed as a whole, the granites of South-Eastern Egypt are\r\ncharacterised by their strongly acid composition. Though perfectly\r\nnormal granites are found in many places, and a gradual passage\r\ninto quartz-syenite may be occasionally traced, yet on the whole\r\nthe rocks approximate to the aplitic and pegmatitic types in which\r\nquartz and felspar are associated with very small quantities of\r\nferro-magnesian minerals.\r\n\r\nWe may consider the granites as falling mainly into the following\r\nclasses:—\r\n\r\n1. Normal pink granite.\r\n\r\n2. Red pegmatitic granite.\r\n\r\n3. Aplite.\r\n\r\n4. Biotite-granite.\r\n\r\n5. Muscovite-granite.\r\n\r\n6. Hornblende-granite.\r\n\r\n                                                         =PLATE XXII.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ball.—Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\n=ACID IGNEOUS ROCKS.=\r\n\r\n=PORPHYRITIC GRANITE.= Gebel Fereyid.\r\n\r\n=PEGMATITIC RED GRANITE.= Wadi Gemal.\r\n\r\n=BIOTITE-GRANITE.= Gebel Abu Hegilig.\r\n\r\n=HORNBLENDE-GRANITE.= Gebel Elba.\r\n\r\n=QUARTZ-FELSITE.= Near Gebel Kolaiqo.\r\n\r\n=QUARTZ-FELSITE.= Near Gebel Kolaiqo.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\n=Normal pink granite= is the form of granite most commonly met with\r\nin South-Eastern Egypt. It forms the principal rock of many of the\r\nmountains, such as Gebels Nugrus, Selaia, Faraid, Um Reit, Shigigat,\r\nNiqrub, Abu Brush, and Hamra Dom, and also covers large expanses of\r\nlow hill country, and occurs as knolls scattered over sandy plains\r\nsuch as that of Selaia and the tract west of Um Reit. The rock\r\n[11,505], a full size representation of which is shown on Plate\r\nXXII, is composed of pink orthoclase, white oligoclase, quartz,\r\nand biotite, with hornblende, sphene, apatite, and magnetite as\r\naccessory minerals. The pink orthoclase is the dominant constituent,\r\nand gives the colour to the mass; it is sometimes in grains of about\r\nthe same size as those of the quartz, _viz._, two to four millimetres\r\nin diameter, but frequently tends to assume a porphyritic habit, the\r\ncrystals then measuring a centimetre or more across, and inclining to\r\nidiomorphic forms. Microcline is occasionally sparingly present. The\r\noligoclase is white, and is far less abundant and less conspicuous\r\nthan the orthoclase; in the porphyritic varieties of the rock,\r\nthe oligoclase is mixed with the quartz and mica of the ground\r\nmass. In some specimens the felspars are fresh, in others [12,133]\r\nthey show clouding due to decomposition, with formation of kaolin\r\nand occasionally of sericite. Quartz is present to about half the\r\namount of the felspars, in grains ranging up to three millimetres in\r\ndiameter. The biotite is frequently the only ferro-magnesian mineral\r\npresent, occurring in wisps and little nests among the other minerals;\r\nunder the microscope it is strongly pleochroic, the colour varying\r\nfrom usually a pale olive brown to nearly black when a crystal is\r\nrotated over a nicol prism, though in a specimen [11,531] from the\r\nlittle hill called Sikeit, about five kilometres west of Berenice,\r\ncolour range is from pale yellow to deep green. Hornblende is\r\ntypically either absent or present only in a very subordinate amount\r\nto the biotite. It is sometimes altered to chlorite, with separation\r\nof granules of iron oxide and formation of epidote. Sphene, apatite,\r\nand magnetite are usually only very sparingly present, and are only\r\nvisible on microscopic examination. In a slide cut from the rock\r\nof Gebel Fereyid, however, sphene forms a crystal measuring 1·6\r\nmillimetres across, of the characteristic wedgelike form (_see_\r\nFig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—Granite, Gebel Fereyid [11,505], × 10. _f_,\r\nfelspar (mostly orthoclase), somewhat clouded by decomposition; _q_,\r\nquartz; _b_, biotite; _s_, sphene.]\r\n\r\nThe principal variation in mineral composition of the rock is the\r\ngreater or less abundance of the biotite, and the occasional presence\r\nof appreciable amounts of hornblende. In a specimen from Wadi Kreiga\r\n[12,133], the biotite is almost absent, its place being taken by\r\ngreen hornblende, now largely altered to chlorite and epidote. The\r\nferro-magnesian minerals are as a rule present in smaller amounts\r\nthan in average granites, and in some places, especially near the\r\nperiphery of the great intrusions, they vanish almost entirely,\r\nand the rock passes gradually into a pegmatite.\r\n\r\nVariations in appearance of the rock are also conditioned by the\r\nsize and habit assumed by the felspar crystals, by the variations\r\nin general coarseness or fineness of grain, and by the pressures and\r\nweathering influences to which the masses have been subjected. Where\r\nthe rock has been crushed, or subjected to unequal pressures in\r\ndifferent directions during consolidation, the porphyritic crystals\r\ntend to lie along definite planes, and the rock may approximate in\r\nappearance to a gneiss. The microscopic sections from these places\r\nshow further evidence of crushing in the cracking of crystals\r\nand undulose extinction between crossed nicols. Where the rock\r\nis much weathered it usually takes on a whiter aspect due to the\r\nbleaching of the orthoclase, and sometimes exhibits green spots\r\ndue to the formation of chlorite from the decomposition of biotite\r\nand hornblende.\r\n\r\nIt is the pink granite which by its disintegration gives rise to much\r\nof the granitic sand which is met with in wadis and on plains. The\r\nrock disintegrates very readily under changes of temperature, the\r\ncleavage planes of the orthoclase aiding in the process. Change\r\nof the felspar to kaolin goes on under weathering influences, and\r\nthe felspars become bleached, but the bulk of the disintegration\r\nis a mechanical process, a large part of the sand consisting of\r\nunaltered felspar.\r\n\r\n=Red pegmatitic granite= is closely associated with the normal pink\r\ngranite, occurring in great masses peripherally to the latter, as for\r\ninstance at Gebel Hamrat Mukbud and in the low hills about the lower\r\nparts of Wadi Gemal and Wadi Kreiga. The red pegmatitic granite is in\r\nfact simply an extreme variation of the normal pink granite in which\r\nthe ferro-magnesian minerals (biotite and hornblende) are either\r\nabsent or present in very small amounts. That the rock often forms\r\ndykes is probably a consequence of its peripheral position rather\r\nthan of any special manner of formation. The great masses such\r\nas Gebel Hamrat Mukbud appear, like the normal granites, to have\r\nsolidified under plutonic conditions, and the dykes are off-shoots\r\nfrom the main mass. There is, therefore, no reason in this locality\r\nfor classifying the pegmatites separately from the granites into\r\na special division of dyke-rocks, as is done by Prof. Rosenbusch,\r\nand we shall consider the red pegmatitic granite as simply a coarse\r\ngrained mica-free granite rich in orthoclase.\r\n\r\nThe pegmatitic granite is usually of a far more pronounced red\r\ncolour than the normal granite. This is doubtless in part due to the\r\ngreater abundance of orthoclase, but it also arises in some cases\r\nfrom the orthoclase having itself a deeper colour. The rocks about\r\nthe lower parts of Wadi Gemal and Wadi Kreiga have a strong brick-red\r\naspect. Their proximity to the coast suggests that there may possibly\r\nbe some connexion between the intensity of their coloration and\r\ntheir position near the sea; this idea is supported in some measure\r\nby the strong red colouration of the dioritic rocks of Ras Benas,\r\nwhich occupy a similar position, but the actual manner of production\r\nof the oxide of iron which gives the colour is not clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.—Red pegmatitic granite, from low hills\r\nnear the mouth of Wadi Gemal [12,106], × 10. _q_, quartz; _f_,\r\nfelspar (orthoclase) turbid and full of finely disseminated red\r\noxide of iron.]\r\n\r\nIn the hand specimen (_see_ Plate XXII), the red pegmatitic granite\r\n[10,389] is a coarse-grained aggregate of red orthoclase and\r\nquartz. The quartz is generally of grey aspect in the mass, running\r\nin strings and networks through the felspar. The rock usually breaks\r\neasily into irregular pieces under the hammer, owing to the facility\r\nwith which the large felspar crystals can be cleaved, but the very\r\nred variety from near the mouth of Wadi Gemal [12,106] is extremely\r\nhard and tough, and strikes fire very easily under the hammer. Under\r\nthe microscope (_see_ Fig. 5) the red colour of the orthoclase often\r\npersists even in the thinnest sections, being evidently due to finely\r\ndisseminated iron oxide which clouds the felspars. The quartz shows\r\nsharply defined angular forms, and appears to have got somewhat the\r\nstart of the felspar in crystallisation. Owing to its cloudy nature,\r\nthe felspar looks like a ground mass, and between crossed nicols shows\r\na peculiar patchy appearance, so that a first glance at the slide\r\nsuggests a quartz porphyry; but the whole of the patches forming a\r\ncrystal extinguish at once, and moreover the characteristic twinning\r\nof the orthoclase can be seen in some of the crystals. A little\r\noligoclase is also present in addition to the orthoclase. Crushing\r\nof the rock is frequently shown by cracked and brecciated crystals,\r\nmore especially in the hard form of the rock from Wadi Gemal.\r\n\r\nDykes of pegmatitic granite are very frequent in the neighbourhood\r\nof Gebel Hamrat Mukbud; they are typically rather paler in colour\r\nthan the larger masses, and occasionally show graphic structure.\r\n\r\nIn ascending Gebel Migif, the gneiss slopes of the mountain were\r\nfound to be strewn here and there with crystals of green microcline\r\n[10,366], similar to the well-known Pike’s Peak mineral. The\r\ncrystals, which are of imperfect idiomorphic form, measuring about\r\none to two centimetres in length, sometimes show cross-striations on\r\ncertain faces. Though the rock was not traced _in situ_, the crystals\r\nare doubtless derived from pegmatite dykes traversing the gneiss.\r\n\r\n=Aplite=, or fine-grained binary granite consisting essentially\r\nof quartz and felspar, with very little or no mica or hornblende,\r\ndiffers from pegmatite not only in its greater fineness of grain,\r\nbut in its structure, which is essentially granitic rather than\r\npegmatitic, the two main minerals being both in allotriomorphic\r\ngrains. In colour, different aplites vary with that of their felspars\r\nfrom red to white, and most of them have tiny dark spots in them,\r\nsometimes only visible with a lens, due to the presence of small\r\nquantities of hornblende or biotite. As already mentioned on p. 268,\r\nmost of the granites of South-Eastern Egypt incline to the acid or\r\naplitic type, and one is frequently in doubt whether to classify an\r\nacid granite, such as that of Gebel Elba for instance, as an aplite\r\nwith a little hornblende, or as a hornblende granite. Under aplites\r\nwill be here considered only those granites in which the proportion of\r\nferro-magnesian minerals is extremely small, not forming more than\r\nabout one or two per cent of the rock. When the definition of an\r\naplite is thus limited, aplites are comparatively scarce in the area.\r\n\r\nGebel Abu Hireiq consists of a red granitic rock; I did not visit\r\nthe range, but the guide sent to erect the triangulation beacon\r\nbrought back as the typical rock a pink aplite [12,134] of rather\r\nfine grain, consisting essentially of quartz and pink felspar,\r\nwith sparsely scattered specks of hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe dykes [11,536] which seam the granite and diorite near where\r\nthe Wadi el Kreim joins Wadi Garara may be classed as siliceous\r\naltered aplites. They are greyish-white to purplish-pink rocks of\r\nrather fine grain, with a few blackish specks, the latter visible\r\nonly with a lens. The microscopic slide shows granitic quartz and\r\nred-stained decomposed matter, with a rather plentiful sprinkling\r\nof grains and powder of iron oxide; the decomposed matter is almost\r\ncertainly the result of alteration of felspar and hornblende, the\r\nlatter in very small proportion.\r\n\r\nThe hill called Marwot Rod el Ligaia, near the head of Wadi Muelih, is\r\na boss of pink aplite, and is of interest as lying in close connexion\r\nwith certain quartz veins which are believed to be of igneous origin\r\n(_see_ p. 266).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—Biotite-granite near Gebel Abu Hegilig\r\n[10,390], × 17. _q_, quartz; _f_, felspar (orthoclase and\r\noligoclase), somewhat turbid by decomposition; _b_, biotite; _s_,\r\nsphene.]\r\n\r\n=Biotite-granite= of a well-defined type [10,390] occurs somewhat\r\nlargely in the mountains round the heads of Wadi Abu Ghusun and Wadi\r\nel Abiad. It is a whitish rock with dark-brown to black spots (_see_\r\nPlate XXII). The white portion of the rock consists of quartz and\r\nfelspar; the dark spots are biotite. Generally the rock is of medium\r\ngrain, the biotite being in nests two to four millimetres diameter\r\nscattered through the mass, giving it a speckled appearance. Sometimes\r\nthe biotite is more uniformly scattered, giving the rock a grey\r\naspect. At some places the rock shows signs of crushing, this being\r\nindicated in hand specimens by a tendency to laminar arrangement\r\nof the biotite patches. Under the microscope (_see_ Fig. 6), the\r\nfelspars, which are somewhat more abundantly present than the\r\nquartz, are seen to consist of orthoclase and oligoclase, with\r\nhere and there crystals showing the characteristic cross hatching\r\nof microcline. The biotite is mostly in nests and clusters of\r\nragged-looking crystals, but it also occurs in tiny flakes included\r\nin the felspars, sometimes showing a distinct arrangement along the\r\ncleavage planes of the latter. The biotite is usually fairly fresh;\r\nit is highly pleochroic, with colour ranging from pale yellow to deep\r\nolive-green in different positions over the nicol. Associated with the\r\nbiotite are a few wisps of colourless mica, probably muscovite, and\r\nirregular granules of opaque iron oxides. Granules of epidote are to\r\nbe seen in the altering felspars, and there are a few small irregular\r\ngranules of a brownish highly refracting mineral, probably sphene.\r\n\r\nA much more acid type of biotite granite [11,507] occurs in close\r\nproximity to serpentine in low hills near the wells of Abraq. In this\r\nthe proportion of biotite is so small that the rock might almost\r\nbe classed as an aplite. It is a fine-grained white rock, very\r\nfresh-looking, with dark spots; in hand specimens it almost exactly\r\nresembles the hornblende granite of Gebel Elba (_see_ Plate XXII),\r\nbut examination with a lens shows the dark spots to consist of biotite\r\ninstead of hornblende. The microscopic slide shows quartz, orthoclase,\r\nand oligoclase with granitic structure, with here and there small\r\nstraggling crystals of brown biotite; the brown biotite is sometimes\r\naltering to chlorite with change of colour from brown to green.\r\n\r\n=Muscovite-granite= is rarely met with in South-Eastern Egypt. A\r\nspecimen from Gebel Adar Qaqa[128] [12,138] is a fine-grained hard\r\npinkish rock of sp. gr. 2·62, composed of quartz, orthoclase,\r\noligoclase, muscovite, and garnet.\r\n\r\nA very coarse-grained variety of muscovite-granite, in which the\r\nindividual crystals measure several centimetres across, forms white\r\nhills to the east of Wadi Nugrus.\r\n\r\n=Hornblende-granite= occurs in several forms, giving rise to rocks\r\nof different aspects in different parts of the district.\r\n\r\nThe most important and widely distributed form of hornblende-granite\r\nis a fine-grained and very acid rock of sp. gr. 2·59, which but\r\nfor the manner in which it occurs might almost be spoken of as an\r\naplite. It is a white rock, sometimes with a faintly pink or greenish\r\ncast, of medium to fine grain, with black specks of hornblende about a\r\nmillimetre in diameter scattered through it (_see_ Plate XXII). This\r\nrock forms Gebels Muelih and Elba; it also occurs in the low country\r\nround Gebel Hamrat Mukbud, and a gneissose variation of it forms\r\nthe great boss of Um Rasein. Dykes of the same rock traverse the\r\nmore basic rocks of Um Bisilla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.—Hornblende-granite, Gebel Elba [12,118],\r\n× 17. _q_, quartz; _f_, felspar (mostly orthoclase), clouded by\r\nkaolinisation; _h_, hornblende; _b_, biotite, altering with separation\r\nof flakes of limonite.]\r\n\r\nUnder the microscope the rock from Gebel Elba [12,118] is seen to\r\nconsist of quartz, orthoclase, a little oligoclase, hornblende, and\r\nsmall quantities of biotite (_see_ Fig. 7). The orthoclase is somewhat\r\nclouded in strips parallel to the clino-axis of the crystals. The\r\nhornblende is in irregular grains of sharply marked curved outlines;\r\nit is of a very deep bottle-green colour. The accessory biotite is\r\nbrown, occurring as small wisps associated with the hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe rock of Gebel Muelih [10,355] is similar to that of Gebel Elba,\r\nbut the hornblende here is of an extremely pale greenish brown colour,\r\nonly slightly pleochroic, with well-marked vertical cleavage and a\r\nvery small extinction angle, so that it might be mistaken for biotite,\r\nwhich latter mineral appears to be absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.—Hornblende-granite, Gebel Hamata [10,405],\r\n× 10. _q_, quartz (the rock contains a larger percentage of quartz\r\nthan appears in the drawn portion of the slide); _f_, felspar\r\n(orthoclase), clouded; _h_, hornblende, altered.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of hornblende-granite, differing from that last\r\ndescribed in being of coarser grain and containing much more abundant\r\nhornblende, and thus having much more the appearance of an ordinary\r\ngrey granite, occurs in the lower part of Gebel Hamata and the\r\nsurrounding mountains. This rock [10,405] is slightly heavier than\r\nthe foregoing type, having a sp. gr. of 2·66. Under the microscope\r\n(_see_ Fig. 8) the hornblende is seen to be of a dark green colour,\r\nvery much altered and clouded by separated iron oxides and epidote.\r\n\r\nA third type of hornblende-granite is formed by the variation of\r\nthe normal pink granite already referred to, in which the place of\r\nbiotite is largely taken by hornblende. The mass of Gebel Mishbih\r\nappears[129] to consist of a rock of this type, which passes by\r\ninsensible gradations into a syenite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Granite-porphyry.=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.—Granite-porphyry, Kreishim Hill [12,150],\r\nviewed between crossed nicols, × 10. _q_, quartz (the dark triangular\r\narea to the left of figure is also a quartz crystal in the position\r\nof extinction); _f_, felspar (oligoclase); _g_, micro-granitic\r\nground mass.]\r\n\r\nUnder this heading are comprised rocks of granitic composition in\r\nwhich porphyritic crystals of quartz, felspar, and mica are surrounded\r\nby a fine-grained ground mass of entirely granitic (holocrystalline)\r\ncharacter. They differ from porphyritic granites in the much finer\r\ngrain of the general body of the rock, and from the quartz felsites\r\nin the entire absence of glassy matter from the ground mass. Rocks\r\nof this type are scarce in South-Eastern Egypt. An example [12,150]\r\noccurs at the hill called Kreishim, sixteen kilometres west of\r\nHalaib. Here the rock, which appears to form a small boss, consists\r\nof rounded white porphyritic crystals set in a finely crystalline\r\ngrey ground mass. The sp. gr. is 2·69. Under the microscope (Fig. 9)\r\nthe porphyritic crystals are seen to consist of quartz and oligoclase,\r\nthe latter in approximately idiomorphic crystals, often beautifully\r\nzoned; the ground mass, of micro-granitic structure, is made up of\r\nsmaller allotriomorphic crystals of quartz, felspar, and biotite.\r\n\r\nDykes of granite-porphyry also occur traversing the granite of\r\nGebel Kahfa [11,537 B] and in the basic rocks of Gebel Um Bisilla\r\n[11,518]. At both these places the rocks are far less fresh than that\r\nabove described. In the hand specimen they are of a greyish-white\r\nor greenish-white colour, strongly resembling fine-grained aplites\r\nin appearance. With the lens, crystals of quartz and felspar can be\r\nmade out, and specks of hornblende and chlorite. The microscopic\r\nslides show the characteristic structure of granite porphyry, but\r\nthe felspars are all clouded by decomposition products, and the\r\nhornblende, which is rather sparingly present in the ground mass,\r\nis mostly changed to chlorite and epidote. The specimen from Gebel\r\nKahfa contains a small amount of muscovite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Quartz-felsite.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThough covering only small areas, quartz-felsite is of very wide\r\ndistribution in South-Eastern Egypt. It typically forms dykes and\r\nintrusive sheets traversing the plutonic and metamorphic rocks,\r\nbut likewise occurs occasionally in larger masses. Felsite dykes\r\nare specially abundant in the neighbourhood of Gebels Muelih,\r\nZergat Naam, and Um Reit. Larger masses occur in the Wadi Huluz,\r\nand form the summits of Gebels Nigrub el Foqani and Hamata.\r\n\r\nFelsites are frequently met with in a highly altered condition. The\r\ncommonest alteration, especially in dykes, is kaolinisation of the\r\nfelspars and a clouding of the whole rock with finely disseminated\r\niron oxides. In some dykes traversing the granite of Um Reit,\r\na bleaching action has reduced the felsite to the appearance\r\nof a limestone. In other cases the rock has been devitrified and\r\nindurated to a high degree; this is well seen in Gebel Igli el Iswid\r\n(latitude 25°) and at Gebel Hadarba (latitude 22°), where extensive\r\nhill-tracts consist of felsitic rocks of almost flinty hardness.\r\n\r\nThe quartz-felsites are in general among the youngest of the igneous\r\nrocks of the district, since they commonly form dykes and intrusions,\r\nnot only in the schists, but also in the granites and other eruptive\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.—Quartz-felsite, Wadi Huluz [10,394],\r\n× 10. _q_, quartz; _f_, felspar (orthoclase and oligoclase); _g_,\r\nground mass, showing flow structure round the porphyritic quartz\r\nand felspar.]\r\n\r\nThe quartz-felsite of Wadi Huluz [10,394] occurs in considerable\r\nmasses about a kilometre below the water holes of Um Gerifat. In\r\nthe hand specimen, it is of granitoid appearance, with opalescent\r\nquartz crystals two millimetres or more in diameter plentifully\r\nscattered in a light greyish ground mass. The sp. gr. is 2·71. Under\r\nthe microscope the crystals of quartz are seen to have rounded\r\nforms and to be accompanied by other porphyritic crystals of\r\northoclase and oligoclase, often approximating to idiomorphic shape\r\n(_see_ Fig. 10). The porphyritic constituents are embedded in a\r\ncryptocrystalline ground mass, in which augite and minute grains of\r\nquartz, felspar, and biotite can be made out, and there are some\r\nstrings and granules of epidote and fairly large specks of iron\r\noxides. The ground mass shows a fluidal arrangement, the little\r\nbiotite flakes in it being often arranged in lines which sweep\r\nround the porphyritic crystals. The rock has undergone considerable\r\nalteration, the felspar crystals being clouded and full of tiny\r\nmicaceous flakes of high double refraction; the epidote is also\r\ndoubtless due to the alteration of augite and other minerals in the\r\nground mass.\r\n\r\nThe quartz-felsite which forms the upper part of Gebel Hamata\r\n[10,906] is a dark brown coarse-textured rock, with remarkably\r\nglassy porphyritic quartz in granules about two millimetres diameter\r\nscattered plentifully through it. It is a very hard rock which rings\r\nunder the hammer and weathers into rusty brown blocks. The sp. gr. is\r\n2·71. Under the microscope the quartz crystals are seen to be\r\nmuch cracked. There are also porphyritic crystals of orthoclase and\r\noligoclase, mostly of irregular shape, and a few crystals, of still\r\nmore irregular form, of dark green hornblende. The cryptocrystalline\r\nground mass consists chiefly of quartz and felspar, through which are\r\nscattered tiny granules of dark green hornblende. The ground mass\r\nshows a matted texture between crossed nicols; there is no trace\r\nof fluidal movement. Like the foregoing, this rock is somewhat\r\naltered, the hornblende in particular being very much attacked;\r\nthe felspars are fairly fresh, but the crystals, like those of the\r\nquartz, are often cracked, and thus show the rock to have undergone\r\nconsiderable crushing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.—Quartz-felsite from dyke at Gebel Kolaiqo\r\n[12,145], × 10. _q_, quartz (a group of idiomorphic crystals); _f_,\r\nfelspar (mostly orthoclase); _g_, microgranitic ground mass of quartz\r\nand felspar, with wisps of hornblende.]\r\n\r\nOne of the quartz-felsite dykes traversing the schists at Gebel\r\nKolaiqo [12,145] is a very similar rock to that of Gebel Hamata, except\r\nthat here the ground mass, instead of being dark brown in the hand\r\nspecimen, is of a reddish brown colour (_see_ Plate XXII), and\r\nthe porphyritic crystals are partly pink felspar and partly glassy\r\nquartz. The sp. gr. is 2·62. Under the microscope the quartz and\r\nfelspar crystals are seen to be less crushed than in the Hamata\r\nrock, while the ground mass, instead of being of a matted structure,\r\nis microgranitic, with tiny elongated grains of green hornblende\r\nscattered through it (_see_ Fig. 11).\r\n\r\nAnother quartz-felsite dyke at Gebel Kolaiqo [12,135] has a rather\r\ndifferent composition, and in the hand specimen has more the\r\nappearance of a felspar porphyry, porphyritic white felspars being\r\nscattered with quartz grains through a dark grey to black ground mass\r\n(_see_ Plate XXII). Its quartz crystals frequently approximate to\r\nidiomorphic forms; they are much corroded by the ground mass. The\r\nfelspar is chiefly oligoclase, in more or less idiomorphic crystals, a\r\nlittle clouded by decomposition products. The ferro-magnesian mineral\r\nhere is chiefly brown biotite, in crystals of smaller size than\r\nthose of the quartz and felspar, scattered porphyritically through\r\nthe ground mass. One of the quartz crystals includes a crystal of\r\nbiotite. The ground mass is crystalline, and appears to consist of\r\nquartz and felspar with a little biotite and some glassy matter.\r\n\r\nA peculiar type of quartz-felsite [10,377] occurs associated with\r\nserpentine and ophicalcites in the upper part of Gebel Ghadir. The\r\nrock, which has a sp. gr. of 2·66, is nearly white, with a faint\r\ngreyish tinge and scattered reddish-brown specks. At first the\r\nrock was taken for a granulite, which it very much resembles in\r\nappearance, and the reddish-brown specks for garnet. But examination\r\nwith a lens shows the specks to be ferric oxide, and here and there\r\nlittle crystals of glassy quartz can be seen. Under the microscope\r\nthe rock is found to consist mainly of an extremely fine-grained\r\nsemi-granulitic colourless ground mass in which are sparsely\r\nscattered clear crystals of quartz, sometimes showing corrosion,\r\nand straggling irregular patches of opaque iron oxide, often mixed\r\nwith nearly colourless wisps of mica. A few of the clear crystals\r\nare in four-sided forms, and may possibly be felspar; but they\r\nare perfectly free from alteration or twinning. The iron oxide is\r\ndoubtless the product of alteration of a ferro-magnesian mineral,\r\nprobably biotite. The minerals of the ground mass are difficult\r\nof determination owing to the minuteness of the grains and the\r\nabsence of any colour, but apparently consist of quartz, felspar,\r\na colourless hornblende, and sericite.\r\n\r\nThe quartz-felsite dykes [10,356] which cut through the granite and\r\nschists of Gebel Muelih appear as grooves in the granite, and as\r\nback-bone ridges in the surrounding schists. They are pinkish-brown\r\nclose-textured rocks, with a dark marbling in places. The microscopic\r\nslides show quartz and felspar in a confused ground mass, with\r\nlittle flakes of a white micaceous mineral (sericite?) aggregated\r\nround the porphyritic crystals and distributed through the felspars\r\nand the ground mass.\r\n\r\nThe highly altered quartz-felsite [12,158] which forms Gebel\r\nButitelib, near Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani, appears to have formed\r\na boss or neck in the surrounding schists. The rock is a very\r\nfine-grained grey to purplish one, in which no crystals can usually\r\nbe made out with the unaided eye. The sp. gr. is very low, being\r\nonly 2·32. Under the microscope one sees small highly corroded\r\ncrystals of quartz scattered through a clouded and glassy ground\r\nmass. No traces of felspars can be seen, the crystals, if they\r\nexisted, having been decomposed and become undistinguishable from\r\nthe ground mass; nor can any ferro-magnesian minerals be made out,\r\nthough there are tiny granules and wisps of iron oxides which in\r\nplaces show an arrangement suggestive of their having been derived\r\nfrom the decomposition of such minerals.\r\n\r\nThe specimen [12,121] brought back from the summit of Gebel Shendib,\r\nby the guide who was sent to erect the triangulation beacon on\r\nit, is a compact brown rock with reddish patches, which under the\r\nmicroscope appears to be an altered and brecciated felsite.[130]\r\nThe slide shows quartz and altered felspars in a spherulitic ground\r\nmass, the whole of the mineral being very much clouded by finely\r\ndisseminated ferric oxide.\r\n\r\nThe felsite dykes [11,538] which seam the granite of Gebel Um Reit are\r\na still more highly altered rock. The dykes are about two metres wide,\r\nof a white colour, and resemble limestone in appearance; being soft,\r\nthey have weathered more rapidly than the granite around them, leaving\r\nvertical-sided chasms. But for the manner of its occurrence, the\r\nrock would have been easily mistaken in the field for a sedimentary\r\none. The microscope, however, confirms its eruptive origin. The\r\nslides cut from the rock show a confused and clouded semi-crystalline\r\naggregate, containing clearer small areas of quartz. Even the quartz\r\ncrystals are full of specks, and only the faintest traces can be seen\r\nof the felspars, which are so decomposed as to be hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom the ground mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.—Altered quartz-felsite, Gebel Igli\r\nel Iswid [10,372], as seen between crossed nicols, × 40. _f_,\r\nfelspar (mostly orthoclase in the position of extinction); _h_,\r\na crystal of hornblende; _g_, hemi-crystalline ground mass; _m_,\r\nmicropegmatitic intergrowth of quartz and felspar, separating the\r\nporphyritic crystals.]\r\n\r\nIn the rocks of Gebels Igli el Iswid, Mahali, and Hadarba, we\r\nhave quartz-felsites which have been altered in quite a different\r\nway. The rocks are extremely hard, and almost flinty, breaking with a\r\nsub-conchoidal fracture. They are typically of a brown to nearly black\r\ncolour, with white spots measuring a millimetre or two across. Under\r\nthe microscope these white spots are seen in the rock from Gebel\r\nIgli el Iswid [10,372] to be chiefly porphyritic felspar and quartz\r\ncrystals, sometimes corroded by the ground mass; while the black\r\nground mass is largely composed of extremely fine micro-pegmatitic\r\nintergrowths of quartz and felspar, with some glassy matter,\r\nand here and there irregular small clouded and altered crystals of\r\nhornblende. The micro-pegmatitic material has possibly originated by\r\ndevitrification of an originally glassy ground mass. Variations of\r\nthe rock occur in which the porphyritic felspars are infrequent or\r\neven altogether absent, the rock passing gradually into a hornfels\r\n[10,371]. The slide from Gebel Mahali [10,402] exhibits clear\r\nporphyritic crystals of quartz and orthoclase, both minerals in more\r\nor less idiomorphic forms, embedded in, and occasionally corroded\r\nby, a semi-crystalline ground mass. The ground mass contains some\r\ncalcite and iron oxides, probably arising from the decomposition of\r\na hornblendic or micaceous mineral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.—Microperthitic structure in felspar of\r\nquartz-felsite, Gebel Hadarba [12,147], as seen between crossed\r\nnicols, × 40.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks of Gebel Hadarba [12,146-12,149] are essentially similar\r\nto those of Gebel Igli el Iswid, but in some cases they show bright\r\nred veining; where they have been exposed to the polishing agency\r\nof the sand blast, these veined varieties look as though they had\r\nbeen streaked with melted sealing-wax. In some of the slides the\r\nfelspars show a well marked microperthitic structure, while in others\r\nthey are so decomposed that they are barely distinguishable from the\r\nground mass. The ground mass sometimes contains granules and strings\r\nof iron-oxide, possibly referable to alteration of a hornblendic\r\nconstituent, but the rock is too much altered for one to be sure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.—Crushed oligoclase crystal in\r\nquartz-felsite, Wadi Huluz [10,404], as seen between crossed nicols,\r\n× 40.]\r\n\r\nAn altered and crushed quartz-felsite [10,404] which occurs in\r\nthe Wadi Huluz, near where the Wadi el Abiad joins it about eight\r\nkilometres to the north-west of Gebel Hamata, somewhat resembles the\r\nrock of Gebel Hadarba in appearance. It is a jaspery looking rock\r\nof dark colour with red and greenish patches, in which with a lens\r\none can see scattered grains of glassy quartz. The slide cut from\r\nthe rock shows clear porphyritic crystals of quartz, orthoclase and\r\noligoclase in a fine grained ground mass. The porphyritic crystals\r\nare mostly in rounded forms, but some of the felspars show a tendency\r\nto idiomorphism. Many of the crystals are smashed, and some show\r\nundulose extinction. The ground mass consists of quartz, felspar,\r\nand some glassy matter, with abundant epidote in nests and strings,\r\nand a small amount of green hornblende in straggling forms.\r\n\r\nThe east-and-west dykes which traverse the syenite of Gebel Zergat\r\nNaam, and form the actual summit of that mountain, consist of a\r\nvery hard compact flesh-coloured rock which weathers brown on the\r\nsurface. The microscopic section [11,525] shows the rock to be\r\na highly indurated felsite. The original felspar crystals can be\r\nmade out by their shapes, but between crossed nicols they are seen\r\nto consist of a very fine-grained mosaic polarising in low greys,\r\nprobably the result of alteration by siliceous solutions. These\r\naltered felspars are scattered with some quartz in a cryptocrystalline\r\nground mass.\r\n\r\nNo volcanic rocks of acid type have been with certainty identified\r\nin South-Eastern Egypt. It is, however, possible that some of the\r\nrocks above described are in reality of volcanic origin, though the\r\nmanner of their occurrence is more suggestive of intruded masses\r\nand sheets. It is also quite likely that some of the hornfels found\r\nassociated with the schists, as for instance at Gebel Um Semiuki, near\r\nAbu Hamamid, are altered forms of glassy acid lavas; but their vast\r\nage and the intense metamorphism to which they and the surrounding\r\nrocks have been subjected render it impossible to be certain of the\r\nmanner of their origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      INTERMEDIATE IGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n                        (_a_) =SUB-ACID ROCKS.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =Syenite and Syenite-porphyry.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThough hornblendic varieties of granite are fairly common, true\r\nsyenite (_i.e._, orthoclase-hornblende rocks with little or no quartz)\r\nis amongst the rarest of rocks in South-Eastern Egypt. It occurs\r\nnear Gebel Nazla (between Bir Um Gubur and Bir Masur), in the two\r\nremarkable conical hills called El Nahud, which rise from the plain\r\nnear the head of Wadi Natash, and at Gebel Zergat Naam. In all these\r\nthree localities the syenite appears to form intrusive bosses rising\r\nthrough the surrounding rocks.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from near Gebel Nazla [10,625] and from El Nahud\r\n[10,857] are very fine-grained reddish-brown rocks, which can be\r\nseen with a lens to be largely made up of red orthoclase crystals\r\nwith dark specks of hornblende.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.—Syenite of Gebel Zergat Naam [11,515],\r\n× 10. _o_, orthoclase felspar, showing striations parallel to the\r\nbasal planes; _h_, hornblende deep green in colour; _g_, interstitial\r\nquartz.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.—Syenite-porphyry, Gebel Zergat Naam\r\n[11,512], as seen between crossed nicols, × 10. _f_, porphyritic\r\nfelspar (orthoclase); _h_, hornblende; _g_, microgranitic ground\r\nmass containing felspar, hornblende, and some quartz.]\r\n\r\nThe syenite of Gebel Zergat Naam [11,515] rises as a great boss\r\nfrom among the surrounding dark schistose rocks. It is typically\r\na pinkish-brown rock of rather fine grain (_see_ Plate XXIII), in\r\nwhich can be seen shining crystals, three to four millimetres long,\r\nof pink orthoclase, and specks of dark hornblende, with here and\r\nthere a little glassy-looking quartz. The sp. gr. is 2·62. Under the\r\nmicroscope the rock is found to be mainly composed of orthoclase,\r\nwith a much smaller amount of hornblende and a little interstitial\r\nquartz. The felspar is fairly clear, in forms approximating to\r\nidiomorphic, and showing the characteristic simple twinning of\r\northoclase. The crystals are slightly clouded in streaks parallel to\r\nthe basal planes, so that even in ordinary light a faint herring-bone\r\nstructure is visible, the streaks on either side of the trace of\r\nthe plane of composition being inclined to each other at a large\r\nangle. Between crossed nicols this herring-bone structure is very\r\nstrongly marked, and is evidently due to a perthitic intergrowth\r\n(of albite?). The intergrown lamellæ are slightly irregular; though\r\nfollowing generally the direction of the basal cleavage planes they\r\nare not perfectly straight, nor always continuous across the half\r\nof the crystal. The lamellæ extinguish and attain their maximum of\r\nbrightness simultaneously with the respective halves of the crystal in\r\nwhich they occur, so that they become invisible in certain positions\r\nof the nicols; but as the nicols are turned they appear as well marked\r\ndark bands, clearly visible even under low powers. The hornblende is\r\nof exceptionally dark green colour, in irregular straggling masses,\r\noften considerably decomposed and clouded with iron oxide. Accessory\r\nminerals, other than the clear interstitial quartz, appear to be\r\nalmost entirely absent in the slide examined.\r\n\r\n                                                        =PLATE XXIII.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ball.—Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\n=INTERMEDIATE IGNEOUS ROCKS.=\r\n\r\n=PINK SYENITE.= Gebel Zergat Naam.\r\n\r\n=TRACHYTE.= Gebel Kahfa.\r\n\r\n=DIORITE.= Gebel Allawi.\r\n\r\n=DIORITE WITH PRISMATIC HORNBLENDE.= Wadi Muqur.\r\n\r\n=BANDED ANDESITE.= Gebel Sufra.\r\n\r\n=VEINED KERSANTITE.= Gebel Fereyid.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\nIn places, the rock of Gebel Zergat Naam takes on a finer grain\r\nand a greyer aspect in the mass. A slide cut from this variety\r\n[11,512] shows essentially the same composition, but the felspars\r\nare here porphyritic in a crystalline ground mass of felspar\r\nand hornblende. The rock thus passes into syenite-porphyry. The\r\nporphyritic felspar crystals show the same lamellar structure as\r\nthose in the more coarsely crystalline rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Trachyte.=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.—Trachyte, from a dyke at Gebel Kahfa\r\n[11,537 A] × 10. A clear crystal of orthoclase felspar is seen in\r\nthe centre of the field, surrounded by a finely crystalline ground\r\nmass of hornblende and felspar.]\r\n\r\nTrachyte, the volcanic representative of syenite, occurs in dykes\r\n[11,537 A] seaming the granite of Gebel Kahfa. It is a light grey\r\nrock, of very fine grain, breaking with a rough surface, containing\r\npores and small stumpy white pearly-looking porphyritic crystals\r\nof orthoclase (_see_ Plate XXIII). The sp. gr. is 2·56. The\r\nmicroscope shows the ground mass surrounding the porphyritic\r\nidiomorphic orthoclase crystals to be a holocrystalline mixture\r\nof hornblende and felspar. The felspars of the ground mass are\r\nusually in more elongated forms than the porphyritic crystals, and\r\nappear to be partly plagioclase. The hornblende, in small and very\r\nirregular crystals of dark olive-green colour, often clouded and\r\ndirty looking, is scattered plentifully among the feslpars of the\r\nground mass. Accessory primary minerals appear to be entirely absent.\r\n\r\nA rock which occurs in a hill at the head of Wadi Amba-ut [10,375]\r\nappears to be essentially similar to the above, but the porphyritic\r\northoclases are more numerous and the ground mass contains small\r\nquantities of augite and magnetite. This rock is in a highly altered\r\ncondition, the felspars being full of kaolin and epidote, while the\r\nhornblende, which is here of a paler colour than in the trachyte of\r\nGebel Kahfa, is highly chloritised.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (_b_) =SUB-BASIC ROCKS.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Diorite.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThough not forming such conspicuous features as the granites, rocks of\r\ndioritic composition are very widely distributed over the country,\r\nand are specially abundant in the districts to the south of Ras\r\nBenas. They are almost always sharply marked-off from the granites,\r\nbeing generally closely connected with the more basic igneous rocks\r\nand schists. The coarser-grained varieties usually form parts of\r\nirregular intrusive masses, shading off gradually into the more basic\r\nforms of diabase, gabbro, and hornblende rock; the finer-grained types\r\noccur as dykes and irregular bands traversing other igneous rocks\r\nand schists, and are themselves frequently so crushed as to resemble\r\nschists. Owing to their intimate association with other dark rocks,\r\nit is no easy matter to trace the limits of the diorites in the\r\nfield. The same difficulty is found when they are microscopically\r\nexamined, for one finds in their mineralogical composition every\r\ngradation from true diorites, through the intermediate stage of\r\naugite-diorite to diabase and gabbro, while many of the harder dark\r\nschists and hornblende gneisses turn out to be merely highly crushed\r\ndiorites, so that classification must be more or less arbitrary.\r\n\r\nDiorite typically forms low hill country of dark aspect. The rock\r\nweathers as a rule far more easily than granite, and in some cases\r\nthe debris of rounded grains set free by disintegration cover the\r\nsurface and render the climbing of the hills somewhat dangerous,\r\nthe effect being like one would imagine to result from walking over\r\nslopes covered with hard peas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.—Diorite of Gebel Allawi [10,313], ×\r\n10. _pl_, plagioclase felspar, clouded by decomposition products;\r\n_h_, hornblende, olive-brown in colour; _ha_, hornblende altering\r\nto pale-green chlorite; _m_, magnetite.]\r\n\r\nDiorite in the narrowest sense of the term (plagioclase-hornblende\r\nrock) is not by any means abundant. Curiously enough, it is generally\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of old gold mines, as for instance in the\r\nKurdeman and Allawi districts, and it was employed by the ancient\r\nminers for their crushing pans. The rock from Gebel Allawi [10,313]\r\nis a medium-grained one composed of black and milk-white minerals\r\nin about equal proportion (_see_ Plate XXIII). Its sp. gr. is\r\n2·95. Under the microscope the milk-white material is seen to be\r\nplagioclastic felspar, generally much decomposed, while the dark\r\ngrains are of hornblende, pale green to olive-brown in thin section,\r\nwith somewhat feeble pleochroism. Like the felspar, the hornblende\r\nis considerably altered; in places it has lost nearly all its colour\r\nand is converted into pale green chlorite. The accessory minerals\r\nare iron-oxides and a little sphene. Rocks of somewhat finer grain\r\n[10,358] occur in the Rod el Ligaia. In a slide from the last-named\r\nlocality, granules of ilmenite are surrounded by sphene, suggesting\r\nthe formation of sphene by the alteration of ilmenite. A variety of\r\ndiorite [10,403] occurs in the Wadi Huluz in which the hornblende\r\nis nearly colourless, showing only a trace of green colour in thin\r\nsection, and is accompanied by a small amount of augite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.—Diorite, Wadi Baaneit [12,151], × 10. _h_,\r\nhornblende; _pl_, plagioclase; _b_, accessory biotite; _q_, accessory\r\nquartz.]\r\n\r\nA form of diorite which occurs in and about the Wadi Baaneit [12,151]\r\nis very similar to the rock just described, but differs from it\r\nin the more irregular manner in which the two principal mineral\r\nconstituents are distributed. The hornblende is in patches varying\r\nfrom mere specks to eight millimetres in diameter; the felspars have\r\na sugary appearance in the hand specimen. The sp. gr. is 2·81.\r\n\r\nA more highly specialised type of diorite [12,103] occurs in the\r\nWadi Muqur. This is a very beautiful heavy rock (sp. gr. 2·87),\r\nwith shining prisms of hornblende, often three centimetres or more\r\nin length, running through a mass of white felspars (_see_ Plate\r\nXXIII). Microscopic examination reveals the presence of some quartz\r\nmixed with the plagioclastic felspars.\r\n\r\nWhere the alteration of diorite has been very intense, as in the\r\ncountry rock [12,124] of the old Romit mine, the hand specimen\r\ndiffers from that of the unaltered rock in that not only are the white\r\nconstituents of duller aspect, but the dark mineral, instead of being\r\nblack and shining, has a dull greenish-grey appearance. Under the\r\nmicroscope one sees no trace of the original felspar, its place being\r\ntaken by calcite and a confused aggregate of small plates of kaolin\r\nand sericite, while the hornblende is all replaced by chlorite, with\r\nlittle strings of limonite. Granules of quartz, often of relatively\r\nlarge size, are scattered through the mass; some of these are clouded\r\nby minute enclosures, and evidently represent the accessory quartz\r\nof the original rock, while others are clearer and are probably of\r\nsecondary formation.\r\n\r\nFine-grained varieties of diorite are found much more abundantly than\r\nthe normal plutonic type, occurring as irregular masses mixed with\r\nschists and as dykes in schists and other rocks. These fine-grained\r\ndiorites are essentially similar to the coarser-grained rocks,\r\nbut are generally even more altered. The fine-grained diorite\r\n[11,517 A], which forms the top of Gebel Um Tenedba, for instance,\r\nconsists of a mixture of clouded and altered plagioclase and augite\r\naltering to chlorite, with separated iron oxide along the cleavage\r\nplanes of the hornblende. Another specimen of fine-grained diorite,\r\nfrom a dyke in Wadi Kreiga [12,154], is even more highly altered,\r\nthe hornblende being almost entirely chloritised, with formation of\r\nabundant little granules of epidote.\r\n\r\nThe main rock of Gebel Beida [12,160] may also be classed as an\r\naltered fine-grained diorite. It is a dark fine-grained greenish-grey\r\nrock with white and greenish-yellow spots, usually about two\r\nmillimetres diameter, scattered through it, and abundant strings of a\r\ngreenish yellow mineral. The sp. gr. is 2·96. Under the microscope\r\nit is seen to be of similar nature to the rocks last described,\r\nthe hornblende being largely chloritised. There is a considerable\r\namount of accessory augite, and this, though clouded, has resisted\r\nalteration better than the hornblende. The whitish spots seen in\r\nthe hand specimen are made up of a fine mosaic of quartz grains,\r\nwith tiny flakes of a micaceous mineral (sericite?) probably all\r\nof secondary origin, while the greenish-yellow strings are other\r\nalteration products in the shape of epidote and calcite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Augite-diorite.=\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the head of augite-diorite are classed holocrystalline\r\nrocks containing, in addition to the plagioclase and hornblende of\r\nordinary diorites, notable quantities of augite. The augite-diorites\r\nthus form a link between the diorites proper and the diabases or\r\nplagioclase-augite rocks.\r\n\r\nThe presence of augite along with the hornblende is difficult to\r\nascertain in the field or in hand specimens, and can as a rule only\r\nbe detected by the microscopic examination of thin sections. But\r\naugite diorites are generally of somewhat darker aspect than normal\r\ndiorites in the mass, owing to a less abundance of felspar, and are\r\ngenerally tougher under the hammer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.—Augite-diorite, Wadi Um Hargal [11,535],\r\n× 47. _h_, hornblende; _a_, augite, with celephytic border _c_, of\r\nhornblende and iron oxide; _f_, felspar (labradorite); _ap_, apatite.]\r\n\r\nAn augite-diorite [11,535] which occurs on the pass at the head\r\nof Wadi Um Hargal, near Gebel Kahfa, is a heavy (sp. gr. 2·87)\r\ngrey rock of medium grain, very fresh and hard, in which can be\r\nseen lustrous black crystals mixed with a rather small quantity\r\nof white felspars. In thin section, hornblende, the most abundant\r\nconstituent, is in fairly large allotriomorphic crystals, with well\r\nmarked cleavage and strong pleochroism (bluish-green to pale yellow),\r\ncontaining abundance of irregular granules of iron oxides. The augite,\r\nwhich is present to about one-third the amount of the hornblende,\r\nis in crystals of similar size, and likewise showing well-marked\r\ncleavage, easily distinguished by their pale brown colour, absence\r\nof pleochroism, and higher extinction angles (about 40°); some of\r\nthe crystals show irregular cracking and clouding by decomposition\r\nproducts, and are surrounded by celephytic zones of greenish matter of\r\nrather lower double refraction containing flakes and strings of iron\r\noxide, probably representing a marginal alteration to hornblende. The\r\nfelspar, though considerably decomposed, still shows plagioclastic\r\ntwinning clearly, and appears from the extinction angles to be an\r\nacid type of labradorite. The rock contains considerable amount of\r\nmagnetite scattered through it, often in fairly large irregular\r\ngrains, also a few small grains of apatite, and one or two small\r\ngranules of quartz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.—Augite-diorite, Gebel el Anbat [10,411],\r\n× 40. _pl_, plagioclase felspar; _a_, augite; _h_, hornblende,\r\narising from alteration of augite.]\r\n\r\nThe rock [10,411] which forms the dark hills called Gebel el Anbat,\r\nnear the head of Wadi Kharit,[131] is likewise an augite-diorite. In\r\nthe field it is seen weathered into rounded masses often resembling\r\nboulders, of great hardness, and covered with a blackish-brown\r\nskin. The sp. gr. is 2·97. Microscopic examination shows the rock,\r\nwhich is very fresh, to be essentially of the same type as that last\r\ndescribed, but the augite is more abundant and so intimately mixed\r\nwith the hornblende as to suggest even more strongly an alteration\r\nof augite to hornblende (_see_ Fig. 21).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Mica-diorite.=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.—Mica diorite, from a dyke at Gebel Abu\r\nHegilig [10,391], × 17. _f_, felspar (mainly plagioclase); _b_,\r\nbiotite altering with formation of limonite; _h_, hornblende; _ap_,\r\napatite; _m_, magnetite.]\r\n\r\nMost of the diorites of South-Eastern Egypt contain little or no\r\nbiotite as an accessory constituent. An exception occurs, however, in\r\na great dyke [10,391] of very fine grained diorite of sp. gr. 2·87,\r\nwhich traverses the granite of Gebel Abu Hegilig, and which contains\r\nmore biotite than hornblende. The dyke is so decomposed that it is\r\ndifficult to get a coherent hand specimen; but a slide cut from one\r\nof the less altered portions shows the rock to be a very fine grained\r\nholocrystalline one, made up of plagioclase, biotite, hornblende,\r\napatite and magnetite, with abundant alteration products such as\r\nepidote, kaolin, and chlorite. All the minerals, except the apatite\r\nand some of the iron oxides, are allotriomorphic. The felspars are\r\nvery much altered, but appear to be mainly plagioclase. The biotite is\r\nin little brown ragged-looking plates, strongly pleochroic, frequently\r\naltered with separation of flakes of limonite. The hornblende is\r\ngreen, in small and very irregular-shaped crystals, which show very\r\nlittle trace of cleavage and are frequently chloritised. The apatite\r\nis in long hexagonal clear prisms. Iron oxides, sometimes showing\r\nsquare or hexagonal outlines, and epidote in granules, are liberally\r\nscattered through the rock. From the abundance of biotite and the\r\nfine grain and manner of occurrence of this rock it was taken in\r\nthe field for a decomposed lamprophyre; but the entire absence of\r\nidiomorphism in the ferro-magnesian minerals show that it should\r\nrather be placed with the diorites.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Diorite-porphyrite.=\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks which may be somewhat doubtfully classed as altered\r\ndiorite-porphyrites occur at Gebel Abu Hodeid as well as near the\r\nruins of Um Eleiga and at Gebel Um Heshenib.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.—Diorite-porphyrite, Gebel Abu Hodeid\r\n[12,143], × 40. _f_, porphyritic felspar (plagioclase); _h_,\r\nhornblende; _b_, biotite; _g_, ground mass, consisting chiefly of\r\nplagioclase and hornblende.]\r\n\r\nThe triangulation point on Gebel Abu Hodeid not being an occupied\r\nstation, I have not visited the mountain, but the guide sent to\r\nerect the beacon on the summit brought back a specimen [12,143]\r\nof the rock. It is a very fine-grained dark grey rock with tiny\r\nglistening specks. The sp. gr. is 2·88. The microscopic slide shows\r\nit to consist of porphyritic plagioclase in a very fine-grained\r\nholocrystalline ground mass composed principally of brown hornblende\r\nand plagioclase, with a little biotite and a plentiful sprinkling\r\nof tiny granules of iron oxides. The porphyritic plagioclases\r\nare inclined to idiomorphic forms, forming crystals about half a\r\nmillimetre in length, and hence are not very conspicuous in the hand\r\nspecimen; they are considerably clouded by decomposition, but still\r\nshow repeated twinning very clearly. The hornblende, which forms the\r\nmain constituent of the ground mass, is of a pale to dark yellow-brown\r\ncolour, mostly in rounded granules in which cleavage is not very\r\nstrongly marked. The plagioclase of the ground mass is likewise in\r\ntiny granules, mixed with the hornblende. Biotite is only sparingly\r\npresent in the slide; it is in tiny brown flakes. All the minerals\r\nof the ground mass show more or less decomposition and clouding,\r\nand contain a fairly plentiful sprinkling of minute grains of iron\r\noxides; flakes of this latter substance are specially evident in\r\nthe decomposing biotite.\r\n\r\nThe diorite-porphyrite of Um Eleiga [11,527 B] occurs associated\r\nwith fine grained gabbro round the old mines. It is a grey rock,\r\nbreaking with a rough surface, in which porphyritic lath-shaped\r\nfelspar crystals, up to three millimetres long, are somewhat\r\nsparsely scattered in a fine-grained ground mass. The sp. gr. is\r\n2·82. The microscopic slide reveals the ground mass to be finely\r\nholocrystalline, composed of plagioclase and pale green to brown\r\nhornblende, with some magnetite. The plagioclase of the ground mass\r\nis partly in little laths, and the hornblende frequently shows a\r\ntendency to prismatic and fibrous forms. The whole rock is in a\r\nrather advanced state of alteration, all the crystals in the slide\r\nbeing strongly clouded by kaolin and other decomposition products.\r\n\r\nThe summit rock of Gebel Um Heshenib [10,392] appears to be a highly\r\naltered basic diorite-porphyrite forming a dyke in the surrounding\r\nschists. It is a dark-grey heavy rock (sp. gr. 3·04), of basaltic\r\nappearance, with white porphyritic patches, more or less rounded in\r\nform, scattered through it. The microscopic slide shows the white\r\npatches now to consist mainly of kaolinic matter, with which is\r\nmixed a clear mineral (sericite?), of very low refractive index, but\r\nshowing rather high double-refraction colours; while the ground mass\r\nis a very fine-grained mixture of rather fibrous pale green hornblende\r\nwith kaolinic matter. Hardly a trace of unaltered felspar remains, but\r\nit seems natural to ascribe the kaolin both of the porphyritic areas\r\nand of the ground mass to the decomposition of original felspars.\r\n\r\nA dyke of fine-grained brown rock which occurs in the granite of\r\nthe lower part of Wadi Kreiga [12,102] likewise appears to be an\r\naltered diorite-porphyrite. It is much less dense than the rock\r\nlast described, its sp. gr. being only 2·68. The microscopic slide\r\nshows the main constituent to be plagioclase felspar in idiomorphic\r\nforms, much altered to kaolin and calcite and stained red by iron\r\noxide. Between the felspars are irregular patches of chloritic\r\nand serpentinous matter, with calcite and flakes of limonite, the\r\nalteration products of a ferro-magnesian mineral which was probably\r\noriginally hornblende.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Augite-porphyrite.=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.—Augite-porphyrite, Wadi Muelih [10,359],\r\n× 40. _a_, augite; _pl_, plagioclase; _h_, hornblende, much clouded\r\nwith iron oxides. The rock contains large porphyritic plagioclase\r\nand hornblende crystals not shown in the figure.]\r\n\r\nA dyke of augite porphyrite [10,353] occurs in the Wadi Muelih\r\nabout half-way between Gebel Muelih and Erf el Fahid. It is a\r\nfine-grained reddish-brown rock of sp. gr. 2·79, with porphyritic\r\nwhite plagioclase crystals of considerable size (up to two\r\ncentimetres in length) and other smaller porphyritic crystals of a\r\ndark schillerized-looking mineral. The ground mass, when examined\r\nwith a hand lens, is seen to be a very fine-grained mixture of red\r\nand dark minerals, like a syenite in miniature. The microscopic slide\r\nreveals the dark porphyritic crystals as green hornblende, while the\r\nground mass is a holocrystalline mixture of plagioclase and augite,\r\nwith a little green to brown hornblende and abundance of magnetite\r\ngranules. The felspars of the ground mass are mostly lath-shaped;\r\nthey are much altered, and stained red by iron oxide. The augite, of\r\na very pale purple colour, is abundant in the ground mass, sometimes\r\nin prismatic forms, but more often in rounded grains; it is altered\r\nin places to chlorite, becoming then green in colour. The extinction\r\nangles measured in the less-altered crystals range to over 40°.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Kersantite.=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.—Kersantite, from a dyke at Gebel Fereyid\r\n[11,504], × 40. _f_, felspar (mainly oligoclase); _b_, biotite;\r\n_a_, augite, with a border of hornblende (_h_); _ap_, apatite.]\r\n\r\nOnly one occurrence of a rock which can be with certainty classed\r\nas a lamprophyre has been noted in South-Eastern Egypt. The single\r\noccurrence referred to is that of a kersantite [11,504] which\r\nforms a dyke cutting east-and-west through the granite of Gebel\r\nFereyid. In the hand specimen (_see_ Plate XXIII) it is a fine grained\r\ndark-grey rock, marbled with veinlets of brownish-white granular\r\n(felspathic?) material, and containing here and there porphyritic\r\ndark-brown platey crystals up to three millimetres in diameter. The\r\nsp. gr. is 2·81. Under the microscope, the rock presents a very fresh\r\nappearance, and is seen to be composed mainly of felspars and brown\r\nbiotite, with a little accessory augite, green hornblende, apatite\r\nand magnetite. The biotite, the most conspicuous constituent, is seen\r\npartly in basal sections of perfectly idiomorphic forms, and partly\r\nas long lath-shaped sections; it is strongly pleochroic, the colour\r\nvarying from pale yellow-brown to a very dark reddish-brown. The\r\nfelspar, which has undergone some alteration, forms a sort of matrix\r\nround the biotite; here and there large crystals show a tendency to\r\nidiomorphism, but the felspar is essentially allotriomorphic. The\r\nfelspar appears to be mainly oligoclase; but there are also some\r\ncrystals which show only simple twinning, and these are doubtless\r\northoclase. The augite and hornblende are very sparingly present,\r\nthe former in nearly colourless to purplish crystals, the latter in\r\ntiny forms of a deep emerald or bluish-green colour, with very high\r\ndouble refraction. Magnetite is liberally scattered in small grains\r\nthrough the rock, seldom included in the biotite. Apatite occurs in\r\nvery fine long needles among the felspars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Andesites.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAndesites, the volcanic representatives of the diorites, are much\r\nmore scarce in the south portion of the Eastern Desert than they\r\nare further north. In the district here treated of, only a single\r\ndeposit, that of Gebel Sufra, has been noted as belonging certainly\r\nto the class of andesitic lavas. Some other volcanic rocks consisting\r\nchiefly of hornblende and plagioclase have been met with, as for\r\ninstance at the hill of Ti Keferiai and in the Wadi Huluz; but these\r\nare of so basic a nature that they are more properly classed as\r\nhornblende-basalts. It is also practically certain that some of the\r\nrocks which must be classed as schists on account of their structure\r\nare metamorphosed andesites; among the schists of the Wadi Muelih, for\r\nexample, are rocks which in thin section present a ground mass still\r\ndistinctly andesitic in character, but the hornblendic constituent,\r\ninstead of forming well-defined porphyritic crystals as it doubtless\r\noriginally did, is dragged out into fibrous forms, and the same\r\naction can be traced in the hornblendes of the ground mass.\r\n\r\nThe andesite of Gebel Sufra [10,597] occurs as a columnar deposit\r\noverlying syenites and diorites at the top of the mountain, which\r\nrises to 690 metres above sea-level in latitude 24° 39′. The rock,\r\nwhich is a fine-grained greenish-grey one weathering to a brown colour\r\non exposed surfaces, often shows a banded structure (_see_ Plate\r\nXXIII). The sp. gr. is 2·67. The microscopic section shows the rock\r\nto be highly altered, but sufficient traces of its original nature can\r\nbe made out to leave little doubt of its being an andesitic lava. The\r\nslides show porphyritic felspars in a cryptocrystalline ground\r\nmass composed of felspar with a little hornblende and biotite. The\r\nporphyritic felspars are too much kaolinised for twinning to be\r\nmade out, but a little calcite is visible in their decomposition\r\nproducts, and the crystals are in rather elongated forms which suggest\r\nplagioclase rather than orthoclase. The minerals of the ground mass\r\nare likewise much decomposed, but tiny grains of green hornblende and\r\nwisps of brown biotite, both altering to chlorite, can be seen. There\r\nis an almost complete absence of primary iron oxides, but a single\r\nlarge porphyritic crystal in the slide shows separated hæmatite in\r\nflakes and in strings down its cleavage planes. The nature of this\r\nsingle crystal is not very clear, and it is doubtful if any of its\r\noriginal substance remains; its form and cleavage are suggestive of\r\naugite, but the clear spaces unoccupied by the iron oxide have the\r\nappearance of quartz or clear felspar under crossed nicols.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.—View near the top of Gebel Sufra, showing\r\nthe columnar structure of the andesite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.—Andesite of Gebel Sufra [10,597], as seen\r\nbetween crossed nicols, × 40. Porphyritic felspar crystals in a\r\ncryptocrystalline ground mass.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BASIC IGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               =Gabbro.=\r\n\r\n\r\nGabbros (or plutonic plagioclase-pyroxene rocks with or without\r\nolivine) are widely distributed in South-Eastern Egypt, entering\r\nlargely into the composition of some conspicuous mountains such as\r\nGebels Atut, Madaret Um Gamil, Um Gunud, Um Bisilla, Dahanib, Gerf,\r\nand Hadal Aweib Meisah, and also occurring in smaller patches at\r\nvarious other points.\r\n\r\nThough they are all dark-coloured, tough and heavy rocks (specific\r\ngravity from 2·8 to 3·2), the gabbros vary very much in appearance\r\nat different places owing to variations in size of grain and\r\nin mineral composition. Thus we have every gradation from the\r\ncoarse-grained gabbros such as those of Um Bisilla and Gerf, where\r\nthe individual crystals measure sometimes two or three centimetres in\r\nlength, through the medium grained rocks of Atut, Dahanib and Hadal\r\nAweib Meisah, to the granulitic gabbro of Kolmanab hill, of which\r\nthe grain is so fine that the rock looks almost like a basalt. In\r\nmineral composition, the gabbros show likewise great variety. Some,\r\nlike the rocks of Um Bisilla, are relatively rich in felspar, and\r\nare lighter both in colour and in weight than others in which the\r\npyroxenes predominate; in some cases the proportion of felspar almost\r\nvanishes and the rock passes into a pyroxenite. Some of the gabbros,\r\nsuch as those of Atut, contain olivine, while others, such as the\r\nrocks of Gebel Dahanib, do not. The nature of the pyroxene varies,\r\nbeing sometimes almost entirely diallage, while in others it is mainly\r\nordinary augite, and in others, again, rhombic pyroxenes such as\r\nbronzite and hypersthene occur. A further variation is the presence of\r\nhornblende in some gabbros, either as an accessory primary constituent\r\nor as an alteration product of a pyroxene. In the uppermost rock of\r\nGebel Um Bisilla we have an example of troctolite, a form of gabbro\r\nin which there is no pyroxene but only felspar and olivine.\r\n\r\nIn the field, mountains and hills formed of gabbro are typically of\r\ndark aspect, though frequently less dark than a freshly broken surface\r\nof the rock, owing to a film of iron-oxide which forms on weathered\r\nfaces. This film is most strongly marked in the olivine-bearing\r\nvarieties of the rock; it is very thin, good sound rock being usually\r\nfound at a depth of a millimetre or so below the exposed surfaces. In\r\nform, hills of gabbro are usually in the form of flattish cones\r\nand ridges, whose surfaces and summits are covered with a debris\r\nof rusty-looking weathered blocks of the rock. This blocky type of\r\nsummit is well seen at Gebel Atut (_see_ the view on Plate X, p. 172).\r\n\r\nThough sometimes sharply marked-off from the adjacent rocks, gabbros,\r\nwhen traced laterally in the field, are most frequently found to pass\r\ngradually into more basic forms such as pyroxenites, amphibolites,\r\nand serpentines. It is not always easy in the field to distinguish\r\nbetween augite or diallage and hornblende, and one or two rocks\r\nwhich were taken for gabbros turn out on microscopic study to be\r\nreally basic diorites or hornblende-rocks; while a rock at Um Eleiga,\r\nwhich strongly resembles a rather fine-grained diorite in appearance,\r\nturns out to be a gabbro. The limit between gabbros and peridotites\r\nis exceptionally difficult to map, the proportions of olivine, augite,\r\nbronzite, and felspar changing very frequently in the same rock mass,\r\nas for instance at Gebel Gerf.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the gabbros contain a considerable amount of magnetite as\r\nan accessory constituent, and in some cases, as at Gebel Hadal Aweib\r\nMeisah, magnetite is present in such quantity as to render the rock\r\nstrongly magnetic. Compass readings in the neighbourhood of large\r\nmasses of gabbro are almost always subject to more or less error\r\nfrom this cause. In the case of a gabbro discovered by Dr. Hume to\r\nthe west of Gebel Ranga, near the coast about latitude 24° 24′,\r\nconcentration of the ferruginous matter has gone on to such a degree\r\nas to give rise to deposits of hæmatite containing 39 per cent\r\nof iron.[132]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature evident in the microscopic slides\r\ncut from the gabbros is the remarkable freshness of the felspars\r\nin most of the specimens, which, taken in conjunction with the\r\nbasic nature of the rocks, inclines one to consider the basic\r\nrocks as probably on the whole amongst the youngest of the plutonic\r\nmasses. Another characteristic feature is “celephytic” structure,\r\nin which a shell of green hornblende is found to surround the iron\r\noxides and pyroxenes when they are embedded in, or in contact with,\r\nthe surrounding felspar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.—Gabbro, Gebel Dahanib [11,509], × 17. _f_,\r\nfelspar (labradorite); _a_, augite; _d_, diallage; _b_, bronzite;\r\n_h_, hornblende, probably produced by alteration of augite.]\r\n\r\nA typical olivine-free gabbro [11,509] forms the main rock of\r\nGebel Dahanib. A specimen taken from the summit, where the rock is\r\nrather finer in grain than that of the rest of the mountain, is very\r\nhard and heavy (sp. gr. 3·15), and is formed of a mixture of dark\r\ndull-looking mineral with shining white to colourless felspars. Under\r\nthe microscope it is seen to be a holocrystalline aggregate of fairly\r\nfresh labradorite and pyroxene, both in allotriomorphic forms, in\r\nabout equal proportions. About half the pyroxene is in the form of\r\ndiallage, the remainder being mostly ordinary augite; it is almost\r\ncolourless in thin section, but some of the crystals show a slight\r\npleochroism, colourless to pale pinkish-brown. The augite crystals are\r\nmuch cracked, and frequently show signs of alteration with formation\r\nof calcite, epidote and serpentinous matter. There are a few small\r\nirregular areas of very pale green hornblende mixed with the augite,\r\nof which they may possibly be products of alteration. One or two\r\nelongated crystals in the slide, barely distinguishable from the\r\naugite under ordinary light, show a fibrous structure and straight\r\nextinction with low double-refraction colours; these are probably\r\nbronzite. There are only a few very tiny grains of iron oxide,\r\nand olivine appears to be absent from the slide examined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.—Gabbro, Um Eleiga [11,527 A], × 17. _pl_,\r\nplagioclase; _pc_, clouded plagioclase; _a_, augite; _m_, magnetite;\r\n_s_, serpentinous matter probably from alteration of augite and\r\nhornblende.]\r\n\r\nA fine grained gabbro free from olivine occurs associated\r\nwith diorite round the old mines of Um Eleiga [11,527 A]. It\r\nis a speckled black-and-white rock which would at first sight\r\nbe taken for a fine-grained diorite rather than a gabbro. Its\r\nsp. gr. is 2·93. On microscopic examination the rock is found\r\nto be a holocrystalline aggregate of plagioclase, augite, altered\r\nhornblende, and magnetite, with granitic structure. The plagioclase\r\n(labradorite) is considerably altered and clouded by kaolinic\r\nmatter, especially near the centres of the crystals, but still\r\nshows its characteristic twinning clearly. The augite, which is\r\nsometimes in the form of diallage, is fairly abundant, mostly in\r\nirregular grains, though occasionally inclining to prismatic forms;\r\nit is nearly colourless, but much cracked and slightly clouded. A\r\nclouded pale green to brown mineral, which sends off long tongues\r\ninto cracks in the surrounding felspars, is also fairly abundant. This\r\nmineral polarises in yellows and greys as a confused serpentine-like\r\naggregate of minute fibres, but contains clear and nearly colourless\r\nareas representing the original mineral from which it is derived;\r\nthese clear areas, in which prismatic cleavage is usually well marked,\r\nare sometimes augite, but in many cases they polarise in lower colours\r\n(greys and yellows) than the augite, with low extinction angles, and\r\nare probably hornblende. Magnetite is very abundant in quite large\r\nirregular grains, often surrounded by a thin shell of hornblende or\r\nof the clouded alteration product just mentioned. There are a few\r\nsmall six-sided prisms of apatite, mostly included in the felspars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.—Hypersthene-gabbro, Hadal Aweib Meisah\r\n[12,126], × 4. _f_, felspar (labradorite); _a_, augite; _hy_,\r\nhypersthene (the augite and hypersthene have the same appearance in\r\nordinary light); _m_, magnetite; _hb_, hornblende, forming celyphitic\r\nborders round the augite and magnetite.]\r\n\r\nAnother variety of fine-grained gabbro, likewise free from olivine,\r\nbut containing hypersthene and some hornblende [12,126], forms\r\nthe upper portion of Hadal Aweib Meisah, and a very similar rock\r\n[11,521] occurs in the hills five kilometres south-south-west of\r\nMarwot Elemikan. The rock is very hard, of a grey colour on fracture,\r\nweathering to blocks which have a rusty-brown skin. Its sp. gr. is\r\n2·98. It is highly magnetic, and causes great disturbance of\r\nthe compass needle in its neighbourhood. The hand specimen shows\r\na mixture of shining white felspars with duller black minerals\r\n(_see_ Plate XXIV). On microscopic study, the rock is found to be\r\na holocrystalline aggregate of plagioclase, augite, hypersthene,\r\nhornblende and magnetite. The plagioclase, which forms about\r\ntwo-thirds of the rock, is a very clear and fresh labradorite of\r\na rather acid type. The augite is usually in more or less rounded\r\ngrains, often aggregated into irregular strings and mixed with\r\nhypersthene and magnetite. Only in a few cases does the augite show\r\ndiallagic lamellation. It is nearly colourless, with a slight greenish\r\nor pinkish-brown tinge and faint pleochroism. The prismatic cleavages\r\nare usually distinct, and in addition the crystals are irregularly\r\ncracked. Twinning is fairly frequent, as also are inclusions of\r\nmagnetite in the augite. The hypersthene occurs in grains similar\r\nto those of the augite, with which it is mixed, and from which at\r\nfirst sight it is not easily discriminated; but it can be picked\r\nout by its more marked pleochroism, straight extinction, and lower\r\ndouble refraction. Magnetite is abundant in large irregular grains,\r\nand in smaller granules included in the augite. Hornblende occurs\r\nin subordinate amount to the other minerals, and is principally\r\nseen as a celyphitic zone round the magnetite and augite crystals,\r\nespecially between these crystals and the felspars. It is usually\r\nfairly clear, strongly pleochroic (deep greenish-brown to very pale\r\nyellowish-brown), and where surrounding two or three grains of other\r\nminerals the whole zone extinguishes at once, showing it to be a\r\nsingle crystal.\r\n\r\n                                                         =PLATE XXIV.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ball.—Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\n=BASIC AND ULTRA-BASIC IGNEOUS ROCKS.=\r\n\r\n=OLIVINE-GABBRO.= Gebel Um Bisella.\r\n\r\n=FINE-GRAINED GABBRO.= Hadal Aweib Meisah.\r\n\r\n=TROCTOLITE.= Gebel Um Bisella.\r\n\r\n=DIABASE.= Rod el Nagi.\r\n\r\n=OLIVINE-BASALT.= Einiwai Hill.\r\n\r\n=SERPENTINE.= Gebel Korabkansi.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.—Olivine-gabbro, Gebel Um Bisilla [11,514],\r\n× 10. _pl_, plagioclase felspar (labradorite); _d_, altered diallage;\r\n_o_, olivine, altered in places to serpentine (_s_), with separation\r\nof granules of iron oxide.]\r\n\r\nThe main portion of Gebel Um Bisilla is formed of a gabbro\r\n[11,514] containing a relatively small proportion of pyroxene and\r\na considerable amount of olivine. In the mass, it is a hard tough\r\nrock, consisting of a mixture of white to greenish felspars, showing\r\nplagioclastic twinning with the lens, with dull dark minerals, some\r\nof a greenish colour and others of a rusty-brown appearance (_see_\r\nPlate XXIV). The sp. gr. of the rock is 2·8. The labradorite, which\r\nforms about two-thirds of the whole, is very fresh, but is here\r\nand there decomposed with formation of calcite along cracks. The\r\npyroxenic constituent is now mostly represented by dusty looking\r\nvery pale greenish-brown straggling crystals interstitial to the\r\nfelspars; it appears to have been originally diallage, but is in an\r\nadvanced stage of alteration, polarising as a confused fibrous mass\r\nof hornblende and chlorite, with irregular banding in a direction\r\ninclined at about 30° to the general direction of the fibres. The\r\nolivine is in large rounded grains, nearly colourless where unaltered,\r\nshowing the usual irregular cracks; some of the grains are altered to\r\nyellowish-green serpentine, with separation of granules of iron oxide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.—Olivine-gabbro, Gebel Atut [10,365],\r\n× 17. _o_, olivine; _a_, augite; _h_, hornblende; _f_, felspar\r\n(labradorite).]\r\n\r\nOf the fine-grained olivine-gabbros, one of the principal types is\r\nthe rock of Gebel Atut and Madaret Um Gamil [10,365]. It is a dark\r\nheavy rock, weathering into angular blocks with a thin rusty skin,\r\nof great hardness and ringing under the hammer. On a fresh fracture,\r\nit is seen to be made up of white glassy felspars and dark brownish\r\nminerals, some of which have a platey structure with cleavage surfaces\r\nwhich flash as the specimen is turned about in the sunlight. The\r\nsp. gr. is 3·01. Microscopic examination shows the rock to be\r\na holocrystalline aggregate of plagioclase (labradorite), augite,\r\nhornblende and olivine, with a very little magnetite. The labradorite,\r\nwhich forms about half the rock, is very clear and fresh, in large\r\ncrystals which frequently show a tendency to idiomorphism. Smaller\r\ncrystals of labradorite are frequently included in the augite and\r\nhornblende. Augite, the next most abundant constituent after the\r\nfelspar, is present in irregular almost colourless grains with\r\nwell marked cleavage and numerous irregular cracks, and sometimes\r\nslightly clouded. The extinction angles measure up to 36°. The\r\nhornblende is in some crystals of a rather pale greenish-brown\r\ncolour not showing very strong pleochroism, while in others it is\r\nmore strongly coloured, varying from a rather deep reddish-brown to\r\nvery pale yellowish-brown when turned over the nicol. The hornblende\r\nand augite are frequently associated in such a manner as to suggest\r\nthat much of the hornblende in the rock originated from alteration\r\nof augite. The olivine is fairly abundant in large rounded grains,\r\nwith the usual blackened irregular cracks; it is mostly fresh,\r\nbut here and there are patches converted into nearly colourless\r\nserpentine with separation of numerous granules of iron oxide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.—Olivine-gabbro, from a hill eleven\r\nkilometres east of Gebel Selaia [10,412], × 17. _pl_, plagioclase\r\nfelspar (labradorite); _a_, augite; _hy_, hypersthene; _o_, olivine,\r\nwith irregular cracks marked by separated magnetite; _h_, hornblende,\r\nenclosing the other minerals and forming a pseudocelephytic border\r\nround the olivine and augite. The rock typically contains a somewhat\r\ngreater proportion of hornblende than appears in the figure.]\r\n\r\nAnother olivine-gabbro [10,412], which forms a hill rising from\r\nthe plain about eleven kilometres east of Gebel Selaia, resembles\r\nthat of Gebel Atut, but is rather coarser in grain and contains\r\nless plagioclase, a larger proportion of hornblende, and probably a\r\nlittle accessory hypersthene. It is a dense dark and tough rock of\r\nsp. gr. 3·17, containing large black schillerized-looking crystals\r\nsometimes measuring one centimetre across, and a liberal sprinkling\r\nof white plagioclase with a few tiny grains of pyrite. Under the\r\nmicroscope, very clear and fresh labradorite is seen to form less than\r\none-third of the rock; the crystals, which are mostly of irregular\r\noutline, are frequently enclosed in the hornblende. The hornblende\r\noccurs very abundantly as larger irregular green and brown crystals,\r\nwith well-marked prismatic cleavage; it often encloses crystals of\r\nall the other minerals, forming a pseudo-celephytic border round the\r\nenclosed augite and olivine. Augite is somewhat less abundant than\r\nthe hornblende, with which it is intergrown, in pale pinkish-brown\r\ncrystals, slightly pleochroic, with very distinct vertical\r\ncleavage and irregular cracks. Twinning is not very frequent. The\r\nextinction angles are usually under 30°. A few crystals which show\r\nslightly stronger pleochroism (pinkish-brown to very pale green)\r\nthan the ordinary augite, and straight extinction, are probably\r\nhypersthene. Olivine is present in about equal quantity with the\r\naugite, in large irregular grains, much cracked, but otherwise fairly\r\nfresh, polarising in brilliant colours; the cracks are blackened with\r\nseparated iron oxide, but there is very little serpentinisation. There\r\nare a few small grains of pyrite and magnetite, but iron ores are\r\nnot nearly so conspicuous as in some of the other rocks of this class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Troctolite.=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.—Troctolite of Gebel Um Bisilla [11,522],\r\n× 17. The crystals with the dark irregular cracks are olivine (_o_),\r\naltering to serpentine (_s_); the resulting expansion has crushed the\r\nsurrounding clear plagioclase crystals (_pl_), forming large numbers\r\nof curved cracks into which little tongues of serpentine project.]\r\n\r\nIf the gabbro of Gebel Um Bisilla is followed towards the summit, a\r\ndiminution in the pyroxenic content, with a corresponding increase in\r\nthe proportion of olivine, is noted, and at the top of the mountain\r\nwe have a troctolite, or rock composed essentially of plagioclase\r\nand olivine [11,522]. It is a heavy speckled black-and-white rock,\r\nmade up of colourless to milky and greyish-black grains about three\r\nmillimetres diameter (_see_ Plate XXIV). Its sp. gr. is 2·84. The\r\nrock looks like a diorite in the hand specimen; it weathers to\r\nrusty looking blocks of remarkable hardness. Under the microscope\r\nthe mineral which looks greyish-black in the hand specimen is found\r\nto be olivine, colourless where unaltered in thin section; but the\r\nusual alteration to serpentine has gone on along irregular cracks,\r\nand the separated granules or iron oxide give the black colour to the\r\nmass. The felspar, which forms considerably more than half the rock,\r\nis a very fresh, though occasionally much cracked, labradorite. Both\r\nthe constituent minerals are present in allotriomorphic grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Pyroxene-granulite.=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.—Pyroxene-granulite, Kolmanab Hill\r\n[12,132], × 40. _a_, augite; _h_, hornblende; _pl_, plagioclase;\r\n_m_, magnetite.]\r\n\r\nThe rock [12,132] forming the hill called Kolmanab, which rises from\r\nthe coast-plain in latitude 22° 32′, resembles the fine-grained\r\nolivine free gabbros very closely in composition, but on account of\r\nits marked granulitic structure, is termed a pyroxene-granulite. The\r\nrounded form of the grains has probably been conditioned by movement\r\nof the magma during consolidation, but the rock contains no garnet\r\nor other typically metamorphic mineral, and there appears to be\r\nno reason for regarding this particular granulite as other than\r\nan igneous rock. It will have been noted that the augite grains\r\nin some of the fine grained gabbros show a marked tendency to\r\ngranulitic forms, and the rock of Kolmanab appears to be merely an\r\nexample of this tendency extending to the other constituents. The\r\nfield relations are such as to suggest an intrusive boss. The rock\r\nis very hard and heavy, greyish-black and basaltic-looking; fresh\r\nfractures show tiny glistening grains when turned about in the\r\nhand. Its sp. gr. is 3·13. Microscopic examination shows it to be\r\nessentially a granulitic mixture of augite and plagioclase with a\r\nconsiderable amount of magnetite, and a little hornblende. All the\r\nminerals are of remarkable freshness, in rounded grains about a tenth\r\nof a millimetre in diameter. The augite, which forms about half the\r\nrock, is of a very pale green colour, sometimes showing faint traces\r\nof pleochroism with the same pinkish tints as hypersthene, from which,\r\nhowever, it is easily distinguished by its high extinction angles. It\r\nencloses abundant rounded colourless granules, which appear to be\r\nfelspar. The felspar is an acid labradorite, and forms a mosaic among\r\nthe augite grains; besides the twinned crystals, there are others\r\nwhich show no trace of this feature, and some of these may possibly\r\nbe quartz. Hornblende occurs, not very abundantly, in larger crystals\r\nthan the other constituents, grains of which it frequently encloses;\r\nit is of an olive-green colour. Magnetite is scattered through the\r\nentire rock in rounded grains, and is specially frequent enclosed\r\nin the hornblende.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Diabases.=\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of diabase are included plagioclase-augite rocks,\r\nwith or without olivine, of a character intermediate between gabbro\r\nand basalt. They differ from the gabbros in their finer grain,\r\nin the general absence of diallagic structures in the augite, and\r\nin the more or less porphyritic nature of their felspars, which\r\nare often ophitically intergrown with the augite. They differ from\r\nbasalts, on the other hand, in being of coarser grain, and typically\r\ncontaining no glassy matter. The diabases of South-Eastern Egypt\r\nare more closely allied to the volcanic division of the basic rocks\r\n(basalts) than to the plutonic (gabbros), and many of the rocks here\r\nclassed as diabases would be called dolerites by some English writers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.—Diabase from under the Nubian sandstone,\r\nRod el Nagi [10,417], × 40. _pl_, plagioclase felspar, ophitically\r\nintergrown with _a_, augite; _l_, limonite. The rock also contains\r\nlarge porphyritic felspars, not shown in the figure.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting occurrence of diabase in this part of\r\nEgypt is a thick bed underlying the Nubian sandstone and exposed\r\nalong the feet of its eastern scarps between latitudes 24° 30′\r\nand 25°. Owing to the north-westerly trend of the scarp, it is\r\ncut obliquely by the meridian of 34°, and consequently only the\r\nsouthern portion of the deposit is shown on the geological map of\r\nPlate XX. The bed is well seen on the west of the road leading from\r\nBaramia to Dungash mines; this road follows the foot of the scarp\r\nfor a long distance. The thickness of the diabase sheet as seen on\r\nthis road is at least ten metres, and is very uniform for several\r\nkilometres. The rock is crushed and decomposed to such a degree that\r\nit is difficult to get a fair-sized specimen. Below the diabase,\r\nat a few points along the road, there are exposures of an ancient\r\nconglomerate of dark colour and extreme hardness. The relations\r\nof the bed to the sandstone are not absolutely certain, but the\r\nimpression I got, when I passed the exposure on the two occasions of\r\nmy outward and return marches, was that the diabase was an extensive\r\noutflow over the old conglomerate (thus indurating the latter), the\r\nsandstone being subsequently laid down on the undenuded diabase. The\r\ndiabase is thus probably Cretaceous in age. A hand specimen [10,417]\r\nfrom one of the least decomposed portions of the sheet, in the Rod\r\nel Nagi, about fifteen kilometres west of Gebel Muelih, shows white\r\nto glassy porphyritic felspar crystals, frequently in lath-shaped\r\nforms measuring up to eight millimetres in length, in a fine-grained\r\ngrey ground mass (_see_ Plate XXIV). The rock contains many rusty\r\nspecks, and occasionally as one turns the specimen about in the\r\nhand one can catch a rather dull flash from a crystal of some dark\r\nmineral. The sp. gr. of the rock is 2·85. Under the microscope the\r\nporphyritic felspars, which are very clear, are seen to be mostly\r\nplagioclase, though some of the crystals show simple twinning and\r\nmay be orthoclase. The ground mass is holocrystalline, composed\r\nof felspar, augite, and limonite. The felspars of the ground mass\r\nare in the form of thin laths, with repeated twinning. The augite\r\nis nearly colourless, with a very pale brownish or greenish tinge,\r\ngenerally clouded by brown dusty matter and small irregular cracks. It\r\nforms irregular grains which are cut up in all directions by the\r\nophitically intergrown felspars. The limonite is extremely abundant,\r\nscattered through the ground mass in rather large irregular grains\r\nwhich frequently show a tendency to square or hexagonal outlines;\r\nit is mostly opaque, but in some parts it is translucent, with a\r\ndeep brown colour. The limonite is doubtless an alteration product\r\nof other minerals, probably magnetite and biotite, of which, however,\r\nno distinct traces now remain.\r\n\r\nBesides forming the sheet under the Nubian sandstone, diabase occurs\r\nfairly abundantly in schists at various points, where it appears\r\nto form intrusions. A characteristic of these occurrences is its\r\nweathering into rusty looking brown “cannon balls.” Altered forms\r\nof diabase are associated with peridotites and other ultra basic rocks\r\nin the serpentine mass of Gebel Gerf (_see_ p. 328). Diabase also\r\nforms veins, frequently magnetic, penetrating granites and schists,\r\nand at one point, near the foot of Gebel Awamtib, a dyke of diabase\r\nis even found penetrating the Nubian sandstone.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these diabases are of very different ages at\r\ndifferent points. While the occurrences associated with the sandstone\r\nare certainly of Cretaceous age, it seems difficult to imagine that\r\nthose associated with the schists and serpentines are not vastly\r\nolder; for though they are obviously younger than the schists,\r\nand possibly younger than the peridotites, they frequently show\r\nmetamorphism to a degree which it is difficult to reconcile with a\r\nCretaceous age, and which suggests that they antedated the folding\r\nwhich formed the ancient mountain chain on the flanks of which the\r\nCretaceous strata were laid down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.—Diabase, Gebel Abu Hamamid [10,400], ×\r\n40. _a_, augite; _aa_, augite, altering with separation of iron oxide;\r\n_pl_, plagioclase, often ophitically intergrown with the augite;\r\n_s_, green serpentinous mineral; _m_, magnetite.]\r\n\r\nAs an example of a diabasic intrusion with “cannon ball”\r\nweathering, we may take the rock [10,400], which occurs in schists\r\non the flanks of Gebel Abu Hamamid. When one of the rusty looking\r\n“cannon balls” is broken, the interior is seen to be a dark\r\ngrey rock of very fine grain. The sp. gr. is 2·93. The microscopic\r\nslide shows the rock to be holocrystalline, consisting mainly of\r\naugite and plagioclase, ophitically intergrown, with some rather\r\nlarge grains and strings of a nearly isotropic clear yellow-green\r\nmineral, and scattered grains of iron oxides. The augite is of\r\na pale brown colour; some of the crystals are fairly clear, while\r\nothers show strong clouding and separation of iron oxide. The nature\r\nof the yellow-green mineral is somewhat uncertain; it polarises\r\ngenerally in very low colours, as an aggregate of fibres and tiny\r\nplates, sometimes showing a spherulitic structure between crossed\r\nnicols. Occasionally it includes granules of a highly refracting\r\ncolourless mineral, possibly olivine; but there is a remarkable\r\nabsence of the separated iron oxide which is usual with altering\r\nolivine, and the granules exhibit only very fine irregular hairlike\r\ncracks; if it is serpentine resulting from alteration of olivine,\r\nthe olivine must have been a variety poor in iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.—Olivine-diabase, from a dyke at the\r\njunction of Wadis Huluz and Gemal [10,393], × 17. _o_, olivine;\r\n_pl_, plagioclase.]\r\n\r\nTurning now to the occurrence of diabase in dykes, a large dyke\r\nin the gneiss at the junction of Wadis Huluz and Gemal [10,393]\r\nconsists of a very hard and heavy, strongly magnetic, greyish black\r\nrock of rather fine grain, in which a dark-brown platey mineral is\r\nmixed with grey and white matter. The sp. gr. is 2·95. Under the\r\nmicroscope the constituents are seen to be plagioclase, olivine,\r\naugite and magnetite, with small amounts of biotite and apatite. The\r\nplagioclase appears to have formed in two generations, for while\r\nthe bulk of it is in small lath-shaped crystals (frequently with\r\nradial grouping), there is a very large porphyritic zoned crystal\r\nin the slide. The olivine is in large crystals, usually rounded,\r\nbut occasionally tending to hexagonal outline with the usual\r\nstrongly marked black irregular cracks. A little serpentinisation\r\nhas gone on at the edges and along cracks of a few of the crystals,\r\nbut, as a rule, the olivine is very fresh; it is never intergrown\r\nwith felspars. The augite is slightly pleochroic, of a purple to\r\nbrown tint, in irregular forms, partly in moderate sized crystals\r\nand partly in tiny grains in the ground mass. The crystals are much\r\ncracked. Ophitic structures are not conspicuous. Brown biotite is very\r\nsparingly present in small flakes. Magnetite is liberally scattered\r\nin small grains in the augite of the ground mass. Apatite occurs in\r\nminute prisms included in the felspars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.—Diabase, from a dyke in Wadi Kreiga\r\n[12,110], × 17. _pl_, plagioclase felspar; _a_, augite; _h_,\r\nhornblende; _l_, limonite strings.]\r\n\r\nThe diabase dykes which penetrate the granite in Wadi Kreiga [12,110]\r\ndiffer from the rock last described in their freedom from olivine\r\nand in showing marked ophitic structure. They are dense brown to\r\nblack rocks of very fine grain, with porphyritic felspar crystals\r\nhere and there. The sp. gr. is 2·98. Microscopic study shows them\r\nto be holocrystalline rocks, composed of an ophitic mixture of\r\nrod-shaped plagioclase with altering augite and hornblende. Both\r\nthe ferro-magnesian minerals are very much clouded, and contain\r\nplentiful strings of iron oxide. The hornblende is dark green, often\r\nforming celephytic shells round the augite, and is probably largely\r\nan alteration from augite. There is very little of the nature of a\r\nground mass, the augite and hornblende practically filling all the\r\nspaces between the felspars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Mica-diabase.=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.—Mica-diabase, Gebel Um Khariga [10,373]\r\n× 17. _pl_, plagioclase felspar; _b_, biotite, with separated opaque\r\nflakes of magnetite, often in geometric forms; _a_, clouded mineral,\r\nprobably altered augite, with which the felspars are ophitically\r\nintergrown.]\r\n\r\nThe rock which forms the top of Gebel Um Khariga [10,373] appears to\r\nbe an altered mica-diabase. It is highly magnetic; the compass was\r\nfound to point 20° out of its normal position at the station on the\r\nhill, while hand specimens broken off the rock showed strong polarity,\r\nsome parts attracting and other parts repelling the needle; a fragment\r\nof the size of a pea deflected the compass needle several degrees\r\nwhen placed near it. It is a dark brown rock, of sp. gr. 2·83, very\r\nrotten, which in the mass looks like an altered dolerite. Microscopic\r\nstudy of a slide reveals the presence of altered plagioclase,\r\nin rather large lath-shaped crystals; biotite, largely altered to\r\nopaque iron oxide, the flakes of which show marked geometric forms;\r\nscattered grains of magnetite, and some secondary calcite. The\r\nbrown clouded mineral polarises as a confused fine-grained and\r\nfibrous aggregate in low colours; it is probably altered augite,\r\nwith which the plagioclases were ophitically intergrown, but is in\r\ntoo highly altered a state for certain identification. The strongly\r\nmagnetic character of the rock would appear to indicate that the\r\niron oxides produced by the alteration of the biotite are, like the\r\nprimary grains, in the form of magnetite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               =Basalt.=\r\n\r\n\r\nBasalt, the volcanic representative of the gabbros and diabases,\r\nis quite a scarce rock in South-Eastern Egypt, having been noted at\r\nonly four or five points. Fairly fresh olivine-basalts, probably\r\ncomparatively late intrusions, form the two conspicuous low hills\r\nnear the coast called Gimeida and Einiwai; more altered rocks of\r\nbasaltic type occur at the head of Wadi Um Deheisi (north of Gebel\r\nKahfa), and in the hills on either side of the Wadi Huluz some ten\r\nkilometres north-west of Gebel Hamata; while an amygdaloidal rock\r\nwhich forms a large part of the hill-mass of Ti Keferiai has been\r\nclassed as an altered hornblende-basalt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.—Basalt, Gimeida Hill [12,156], ×\r\n40. Porphyritic crystals of plagioclase (_pl_) and olivine (_o_) in\r\na hemicrystalline ground mass containing tiny crystals of plagioclase\r\nand granules of augite (_a_) and magnetite (_m_).]\r\n\r\nThe basalt of Gimeida Hill [12,156], is a hard heavy block rock\r\nof sp. gr. 2·88, of dull aspect, with glassy white to colourless\r\nplagioclase crystals up to three millimetres diameter scattered\r\nthrough it, and here and there a dark diallagic crystal and some\r\ngreenish glassy-looking grains of olivine. The microscopic slide\r\nshows the rock to be remarkably fresh; the porphyritic plagioclase\r\nand olivine crystals are seen to be embedded in a crystalline ground\r\nmass containing little lath-shaped plagioclases, with granules of\r\npale brown augite, and abundant grains of magnetite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.—Basalt, Einiwai Hill [12,144], × 17. _o_,\r\nolivine; _a_, augite; _p_, picotite, with a border of opaque chromite;\r\n_gr_, hemicrystalline ground mass.]\r\n\r\nThe basalt of Einiwai [12,144] differs from that of Gimeida in the\r\nabsence of porphyritic felspars. It occurs capping the red granite\r\nwhich forms the lower part of Einiwai Hill and the surrounding\r\nplain. It is a hard dull black rock with little glassy colourless\r\nto pale green crystals plentifully scattered through it (_see_\r\nPlate XXIV). The sp. gr. is 3·10. The microscopic slide shows\r\nporphyritic crystals of olivine, augite, and picotite, in a very\r\nfine-grained semi-glassy ground mass containing tiny laths of felspar\r\nand grains of augite and magnetite. The porphyritic crystals all\r\nshow a remarkable absence of colour in the slide, which has been cut\r\nexceptionally thin on account of the darkness of the ground mass;\r\nthis thinness of the slide doubtless accounts for the minerals all\r\nshowing relatively low polarisation colours. The porphyritic crystals\r\nare mostly in six-sided and prismatic forms, but sometimes show\r\nas rounded grains; cleavage is usually indistinct, but irregular\r\ncracks are common, and some of the crystals are broken in two and\r\nthe halves separated. Most of the six-sided crystals show straight\r\nextinction, and are probably a non-ferruginous olivine (forsterite);\r\nthey show very little alteration, there being a general absence\r\nof serpentinisation or magnetite-separation along the cracks. The\r\nprismatic porphyritic crystals are in forms resembling those of\r\naugite, and some of the crystals show extinction sufficiently oblique\r\nto justify their identification as augite; others, however, showing\r\nstraight extinction and very low polarisation colours, are probably\r\nenstatite. The picotite is in rather large isotropic rounded grains,\r\nof a pale green colour with a well marked opaque border of chromite.\r\n\r\nA peculiar basaltic rock [10,408] occurs at the top of Wadi Um\r\nDeheisi, at the pass into Wadi Um Retba, on the road which passes\r\nfrom Bir Shadli to the north-east of Gebel Kahfa. It is a black rock\r\nof sp. gr. 2·98, and of such fine grain that practically nothing\r\ncan be made out with a lens. It is remarkably magnetic, the compass\r\nbeing deflected by 13° from its normal direction at a plane-table\r\nstation on the pass. The microscopic slide shows rounded and angular\r\nclear areas in a cryptocrystalline ground mass of greenish colour,\r\nfull of specks of magnetite. The rounded clear areas are occupied\r\nby a very pale brownish mineral, probably augite, forming nests of\r\ncrystals in different orientations, with fairly well-marked cleavages,\r\nhigh extinction-angle and fairly high double refraction. The angular\r\nclear areas are mostly colourless; they seem to consist chiefly of\r\naltered felspar, but some of them are formed of a fine mosaic of\r\nquartz granules. The ground mass is largely of chloritic nature,\r\nwith small fibres of hornblende and some decomposed felspar. Its\r\nlarge content of rounded magnetite granules accounts for the magnetic\r\ncharacter of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe basalt of the Wadi Huluz [10,410] is a close grained\r\ngreenish-black rock containing white spots (amygdules) up to three\r\nmillimetres diameter. Its sp. gr. is 2·93. The microscope shows\r\nthe main bulk of the rock to be formed of lath-shaped plagioclase\r\ncrystals, around and between which is green matter, now mostly\r\nchlorite. Here and there are small clear areas within the green\r\npatches, which show bright polarisation colours, and are probably\r\naugite, being the remains of the original mineral which has been\r\nlargely chloritised. There is a fair amount of magnetite in scattered\r\ngrains. The amygdules are partly filled with clear quartz, and partly\r\nwith zeolites.\r\n\r\nThe hill mass of Ti Keferiai is largely made up of a fine-grained\r\nblack rock [12,120], of sp. gr. 2·99, in which are greenish-white\r\nand pink amygdules up to two millimetres diameter. It is frequently\r\nmuch crushed, and in one place it has been broken into a coarse\r\nbreccia and cemented with rose quartz [12,123]. The microscopic\r\nslide shows the main part of the rock to be a fine-grained mixture\r\nof pale hornblende with altered plagioclase, while the amygdules\r\nare filled with radiating zeolites. The amygdules seem to indicate\r\nthat the rock is a volcanic one, and it has been classed as a basalt\r\nrather than as an andesite on account of its basic nature and high\r\nspecific gravity. Its texture is microgranitic rather than basaltic,\r\na circumstance perhaps in part due to the crushing it has undergone;\r\nthe rock is passing into a schist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =Ultra-basic Igneous Rocks.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ultra-basic igneous rocks (_i.e._, rocks practically free from\r\nfelspar and composed entirely of ferro-magnesian silicates such as\r\npyroxenes, amphiboles, and olivines), though forming but a small part\r\nof the earth’s crust in general, occur in very large proportion in\r\nthe igneous masses of South-Eastern Egypt, where they cover several\r\nhundred square kilometres and form prominent mountain-masses such\r\nas those of Gebels Dahanib, Korabkansi, and Gerf. They may be\r\nclassified into:—\r\n\r\n  (_a_) _Pyroxenites_ (rocks composed essentially of pyroxenes);\r\n\r\n  (_b_) _Amphibolites_ (rocks composed essentially of hornblende);\r\n\r\n  (_c_) _Peridotites_ (rocks composed essentially of olivine,\r\n        with or without pyroxenes and amphiboles);\r\n\r\n    All these ultra-basic rocks are easily altered to\r\n\r\n  (_d_) _Serpentines_, in which the original minerals may or may\r\n        not be traceable.\r\n\r\nA characteristic of the ultra-basic rocks here, as in other parts\r\nof the world, is their gradual transition into one another, showing\r\nthat the various forms have arisen from consolidation of parts of\r\none and the same magma owing to slight differences in composition\r\nor in the physical conditions under which consolidation has taken\r\nplace. A further noteworthy circumstance is their gradual passage\r\ninto basic rocks; there is no hard-and-fast line to be drawn,\r\nfor instance, between basic diorites and amphibolites, nor between\r\nbasic gabbros and pyroxenites, nor between olivine gabbros, poor\r\nin felspar and peridotites, these various classes being found to\r\npass by insensible gradations one into another as they are followed\r\nup in the field. Moreover, being typically coarse-grained rocks,\r\nand pyroxenes and amphiboles being often indistinguishable in the\r\nhand specimen, great caution has to be exercised in naming a rock\r\nmass from a few microscopic slides which of necessity each embrace\r\nat most but a few square centimetres of section.\r\n\r\nIn the field, the appearance and cohesive strength of the ultra-basic\r\nrocks varies primarily with the extent to which they have been\r\naltered towards their final stage of serpentinisation. Where they\r\nare least altered, they form black masses of hard heavy crystalline\r\nrock of such toughness that they are only broken with difficulty\r\nwith a sledge hammer; while in the cases where serpentinisation has\r\nproceeded to the greatest extent, they frequently form foxy red or\r\neven pink-looking hills which might almost be taken for granite from a\r\ndistance, and they are so shattered that the rock comes off literally\r\nin tons at a mere touch; in these cases, long search is necessary\r\nto find a coherent piece large enough for a museum specimen. The\r\nbrown or pink colour just referred to is of course only superficial,\r\nbut in the untrodden and rainless wilderness surface films remain\r\nunbroken and give characteristic colours to the scenery. Freshly\r\nfractured surfaces are always dark green, dark brown, or black,\r\nwith more or less crystal structure visible according as the rock is\r\nless or more altered; pyroxenites or amphibolites, when but little\r\naltered, are a mass of lustrous platey or fibrous dark crystals,\r\nwhile serpentines are typically of dull aspect. The specific gravity\r\nis high, ranging from as much as 3·1 in the less altered forms down\r\nto about 2·6 in those which are more completely serpentinised.\r\n\r\nThe process of serpentinisation is of course a chemical change,\r\nconsisting largely in the combination of water with ferro-magnesian\r\nsilicates free from alumina; but it is remarkable how frequently\r\nthis chemical change has been accompanied by a parallel physical\r\ndeformation. Serpentines are almost always shattered rocks, full of\r\nslickensided surfaces; when we compare the low sp. gr. of serpentine\r\n(2·6) with that of augite, hornblende, or olivine (about 3·2),\r\nwe naturally conclude that the shattering of the rock is in all\r\nprobability due to the expansion on hydration causing internal stress,\r\nand the slickensiding is due to the rock yielding along certain\r\nsurfaces. The cracking of felspars and the forcing of serpentine into\r\nthem, which are frequently seen in thin sections of olivine rocks,\r\nsuch as the troctolite shown in Fig. 34 on p. 304, shows on a small\r\nscale the physical effect of expansion on serpentinisation, and\r\nshould lead us to expect a corresponding effect in rock masses. It\r\nis thus not necessary to infer great tectonic movements to explain\r\nthe shattering of the rock, and in fact the disposition of the\r\nserpentines in broad mountain tracts like Gebel Gerf is opposed\r\nto the idea of there being here any local accentuation of folding\r\nor crushing by general crust-crumpling. I have calculated that a\r\nhorizontal sheet of pyroxenite of sp. gr. 3·1, ten kilometres wide,\r\nconfined between fixed abutments and prevented from increasing its\r\nthickness, would rise into an arch having a height of about two and\r\na quarter kilometres at its centre if converted into serpentine of\r\nsp. gr. 2·6; this is, of course, not given as a precise example of\r\nwhat may actually have taken place, but it will serve to show that\r\nexpansion on hydration may produce dynamical effects not inferior to\r\nthose of contraction of the earth’s crust, such as are believed to\r\nbe the main cause of mountain formation, and to explain why we may\r\nfind serpentines shattered to fragments and full of slickensided\r\nsurfaces in areas where the surrounding rocks show comparatively\r\nlittle evidence of dynamo-metamorphism.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Pyroxenites.=\r\n\r\n\r\nHeavy dark green rocks, of medium to coarse grain, and consisting\r\nalmost entirely of a schillerized-looking mineral, form the\r\nhill-masses of Gebels Um Ein and Qrein Salama, and similar rocks are\r\nfound in connexion with gabbro at Gebel Um Gunud and elsewhere. From\r\nthe diallagic appearance of these rocks in the hand specimen, they\r\nwere classed in the field as pyroxenites or diallage rocks. But\r\nan examination of the slides cut from the specimens reveals the\r\nmain constituent to be hornblende, and the rocks must therefore\r\nbe placed in the division of amphibolites. It is, however, highly\r\nprobable that these rocks were originally pyroxenites, the hornblende\r\nhaving originated mainly from the alteration of augite; the change\r\nfrom augite to hornblende in the gabbros has already (p. 302) been\r\nremarked, and in these ultra-basic forms the same process appears\r\nto have gone on.\r\n\r\nSome parts of the great ultra-basic mass of Gebel Gerf consist of\r\nbronzite-rock. Specimens from the least altered portions consist\r\nalmost entirely of bronzite, sometimes with a little olivine;\r\nthe rocks are, however, generally found passing into serpentine,\r\nsuch as forms the main portion of the mountain, and on microscopic\r\nexamination even the freshest portions always exhibit more or less\r\nserpentinisation. It will accordingly be preferable to treat of\r\nthese rocks under the heading of serpentines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Amphibolites.=\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks consisting almost entirely of hornblende occur in considerable\r\nmasses in the neighbourhood of Gebel Um Gunud, and form the\r\nconspicuous hills Gebel Um Ein and Qrein Salama; they also occur\r\nin a small patch about three kilometres east of Erf el Fahid. In\r\nthe field, especially with the coarser-grained varieties, there is\r\noften considerable difficulty in identifying the main constituent of\r\nthe rock as hornblende, owing to the schillerized appearance of the\r\nmineral being more suggestive of diallage; the mass east of Erf el\r\nFahid, for instance, was classed in the field as a basic gabbro or\r\ndiallage-rock, instead of a very basic diorite or hornblende-rock,\r\nsuch as the microscopic examination proves it to be. These rocks are\r\nalways very heavy and extremely tough; they weather commonly into\r\ngreat rusty-looking rounded blocks, and a sledge hammer is required\r\nto get a specimen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.—Amphibolite, from hills near Gebel Um\r\nGunud [11,511], × 30. Almost the whole of the figure is occupied by\r\nhornblende, which is seen clouded and altering to granular epidote\r\nat _e_. Part of a large grain of calcite, bordered and streaked\r\nwith iron oxide, is seen at _c_, while _q_ is a small crystal of\r\ninterstitial quartz. The slide also contains a small proportion of\r\nplagioclase felspar, not shown in the figure.]\r\n\r\nThe amphibolite of the hills about Gebel Um Gunud [11,511] is a very\r\nhard and heavy coarse grained greenish-black rock composed almost\r\nentirely of shining platey-looking crystals of hornblende, which often\r\nreach two centimetres in length and breadth. The sp. gr. is 3·08. The\r\nmicroscopic slide shows the rock to be granitic in structure and to\r\ncontain, in addition to hornblende, small amounts of plagioclase,\r\nquartz, calcite, and iron oxides. The irregular-shaped hornblende\r\ncrystals show strong pleochroism, from pale olive-brown to moderately\r\ndeep green. The extinction angles are large, being frequently over\r\n20°. Twinning of the crystals is fairly common. Many of the crystals\r\nare clouded, and the alteration of the mineral has resulted in the\r\nformation of much epidote. The plagioclase is only present in very\r\nsmall quantity, strongly clouded by decomposition, but still showing\r\ntwinning clearly. The quartz is clear, and is likewise present in very\r\nsmall proportion, mostly interstitial. Calcite is fairly plentiful\r\nin large rounded and irregular grains, rather turbid-looking, of a\r\nbrownish or greenish tinge, outlined and streaked with strong lines\r\nof iron oxide, in a way which at times suggests that the calcite\r\nmay possibly be the result of alteration of a lime olivine.\r\n\r\nA specimen of amphibolite [11,528] obtained from a hill near the\r\njunction of Wadi Abu Marwa with Wadi Naait, about seven kilometres\r\nnorth-east of Gebel Um Gunud, is a dark green rock of rather fine\r\ngrain, made up of shining plates and small fibrous crystals of\r\nhornblende and chlorite. Its sp. gr. is 2·97. Under the microscope\r\nthe hornblende is in rather ragged-looking irregular crystals of\r\nvarious sizes, all interlocked with each other, rarely showing any\r\napproximation to idiomorphism except in the smaller crystals, which\r\nare commonly limited by prismatic faces; these smaller crystals are\r\nfrequently included in the larger ones. The pleochroism is fairly\r\nstrong, a pale olive brown, c moderately deep green. Prismatic\r\ncleavage is well marked. Extinction angles are often large, ranging\r\nup to 24°. A few of the crystals are slightly bent, and many show\r\nmore or less clouding owing to partial alteration to chlorite, but\r\non the whole the rock is fairly fresh. Except for a few specks of\r\nmagnetite, and the alteration product chlorite, the rock contains\r\nnothing but hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe hornblende-rock or amphibolite of Gebel Um Ein [12,130] is\r\nof medium grain, almost entirely made up of shining crystals of\r\nhornblende with a little chloritic matter. The sp. gr. is 3·03. The\r\nmicroscopic slide shows large individuals of hornblende inclining to\r\nidiomorphism, set in a sort of ground mass of smaller crystals. The\r\nhornblende shows the same strong pleochroism and high extinction\r\nangles as in the two rocks just described; it is frequently clouded\r\nand speckled with iron oxides, and often full of lighter-coloured\r\npatches which extinguish with the rest of the crystal; in many cases\r\nthese lighter patches contain a central granule of iron oxide,\r\nand they are doubtless due to a bleaching by segregation of the\r\niron. Between crossed nicols many of the crystals are full of small\r\nfibres extinguishing differently from the rest of the crystal; some\r\nof these fibres polarise in low colours and are probably chlorite\r\nor serpentine, while others show brilliant tints and are possibly\r\nactinolite.\r\n\r\nThe amphibolite which occurs three kilometres east of Gebel Erf el\r\nFahid [10,361] is of extremely coarse grain, looking like a very\r\nbasic gabbro owing to the schillerized appearance of its large\r\nhornblende crystals and the presence of a little interstitial\r\nfelspar. The sp. gr. of the rock is 2·98. The section shows the\r\nhornblende to be of a very pale green colour, with an almost entire\r\nabsence of iron oxide grains and other alteration products. Between\r\ncrossed nicols it has a fibrous woody appearance. The interstitial\r\nplagioclase (probably labradorite) is likewise very fresh, showing\r\nits repeated twinning very clearly; the crystals are full of tiny\r\nfibres of hornblende, and are traversed by broad cracks filled with\r\na mosaic of smaller crystals of plagioclase and quartz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.—Amphibolite of Qrein Salama [12,157],\r\n× 17. _h_, hornblende, strongly striated, altering to chlorite;\r\n_o_, olivine, and _b_, bronzite, both passing into serpentine.]\r\n\r\nThe rock [12,157], of the hill called Qrein Salama, to the east of\r\nGebel Gerf, is interesting as containing olivine and bronzite in\r\naddition to the more abundant hornblende, and thus forming a link\r\nbetween the amphibolites proper and the peridotites; but as about\r\nthree-quarters of the rock is hornblende it is still classed as an\r\namphibolite. The sp. gr. is 3·05. In the slide, the hornblende\r\nis seen in irregular crystals, colourless to very pale green,\r\nwith a fibrous structure which is strongly marked by patches\r\nof shading of extremely fine black prismatic striations. With\r\ncrossed nicols the fibrous structure is still more apparent,\r\nthe mineral polarising as brilliant fibres separated by chloritic\r\nalteration products. The pronounced striation and faint colour of\r\nthe crystals are more suggestive of diallage than of hornblende,\r\nbut the extinction angles measured in the slide are all less than\r\n22°. Many of the hornblende-crystals contain large numbers of\r\nsmall rounded grains and strings of iron oxide. The olivine is\r\nmostly in rounded crystals, frequently included in the hornblende;\r\nit is largely serpentinised and full of small grains of opaque iron\r\noxides, but kernels of the original mineral remain. The bronzite,\r\nwhich is present in about equal proportion with the olivine, is\r\nlikewise extensively serpentinised and full of iron oxide grains;\r\nit is distinguishable from the olivine by a more fibrous appearance\r\n(the serpentinisation having gone on mainly along the direction of\r\nthe vertical axis instead of along irregular cracks), and by its\r\ngenerally lower polarisation colours in the unaltered portions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Peridotites.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peridotites, or felspar-free rocks consisting largely of olivine,\r\nare usually classified into:—\r\n\r\n  (_a_) _Dunites_, consisting entirely of olivine.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) _Harzburgites_, consisting of olivine and enstatite or\r\n        bronzite.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) _Wehrlites_, containing olivine and diallage.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) _Lherzolites_, containing olivine, diallage, enstatite or\r\n        bronzite, and picotite or chromite.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) _Hornblende-picrites_, containing olivine and hornblende.\r\n\r\n  (_f_) _Mica-peridotites_, containing olivine and biotite.\r\n\r\nMost if not all of these classes are represented in South-Eastern\r\nEgypt, but in the altered form of serpentine. The change to serpentine\r\nhas been so complete that it is now hardly possible to extract even\r\na small specimen of the primitive rock; indeed, careful search is\r\noften required to obtain even specimens containing any unaltered\r\nmineral whatever, and one has frequently to rely on the structure\r\nof the serpentine for the identification of the rocks from which\r\nit originated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Serpentine.=\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpentines cover about 400 square kilometres of South-Eastern Egypt,\r\nforming the principal rock of several remarkable mountain groups\r\nand also occurring in lower hill country.\r\n\r\nThe largest occurrence is that of the great mountain mass of Gebel\r\nGerf, where serpentine with alternations of gabbroid and dioritic\r\nrocks can be followed from Bir Meneiga southward for some thirty\r\nkilometres to beyond the Sherefa pass, while the breadth of the tract\r\nfrom east to west is some fifteen kilometres or more at its widest\r\npart; this tract includes a vast assemblage of high peaks and ridges,\r\ntowering up in many cases to more than a kilometre above sea-level. To\r\nthe north, south, and east, the serpentine is bounded by gabbros and\r\ndiorites, while on the west a tract of schistose rocks separates it\r\nfrom another great serpentine mass which forms Gebel Korabkansi.\r\n\r\nOther remarkable serpentine masses are Gebel Abu Dahr and the upper\r\npart of Gebel Sikait; serpentines also enter into the composition of\r\nGebels Ghadir and Um Tenedba, while lower hills formed of similar\r\nrocks occur near Bir Murra in Wadi Shait, in Wadi Um Khariga, near\r\nGebel Kalalat, and on the plain east of Abraq Springs.\r\n\r\nThe foxy red colour of exposed faces of serpentine hills, and the\r\ngenerally shattered nature of the rock, have already been referred\r\nto. When one approaches the masses closely, the red colour often\r\nbecomes less marked, because the fresh debris flanking the hills is\r\nof a darker aspect. The slopes of serpentine hills are usually steep,\r\nand this combined with the rotten nature of the rock renders their\r\nclimbing not always quite free from danger.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to map out in the field the precise limits of the\r\ndifferent peridotites which were the parents of the serpentine ends\r\nin failure, partly because the constituent minerals can generally\r\nonly be identified on microscopic examination, and partly because\r\nthe different peridotites pass gradually one into another, and are\r\nevidently only produced by slight variations in the composition or\r\nconditions of consolidation of a single magma. Even the limits of the\r\nserpentine itself are not always very clear; for where the associated\r\nrock is gabbro, as for instance to the north of Gebel Gerf, there is\r\na gradual passage through more or less serpentinised olivine gabbro\r\nto the true serpentine. Golden yellow veinlets of fibrous chrysotile\r\ncan be seen running through the rock at many places, and occasionally\r\nveins and pockets of magnesite and an inferior kind of asbestos occur\r\n(_see_ p. 330).\r\n\r\nThe serpentines are nearly always more or less magnetic, and\r\nsometimes show strong polarity. The compass was disturbed by\r\n40° at the triangulation station on Gebel Sikait; the amount of\r\ndisturbance changes greatly when one moves even a short distance,\r\nand all estimations of direction from compass readings in serpentine\r\ncountry are therefore liable to enormous error.\r\n\r\nIn a strictly petrographical sense it would be most systematic to\r\ndescribe the serpentines in classes according to the nature of the\r\nparent rock; grouping together, for instance, all those derived from\r\npyroxenites into one class, those from amphibolites into another,\r\nthose from dunites into a third, and so on. But besides the fact\r\nthat the nature of the parent rock cannot always be determined with\r\ncertainty, such a course would possess the objection of separating the\r\ndifferent parts of one and the same mass; at Gebel Gerf, for example,\r\nwe have serpentines derived from rocks of various of these classes,\r\nthough probably all formed part of the same igneous intrusion and\r\nare thus genetically connected. In the descriptions which follow,\r\ntherefore, the serpentines of each locality will be grouped together,\r\nirrespective of origin. The localities are taken in order of latitude\r\nfrom north to south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.—Serpentine, probably derived from a\r\nmica-peridotite, east of Erf el Fahid [10,360], × 40. _cm_, chlorite\r\nand magnetite from alteration of biotite; _s_, clear serpentine,\r\nprobably altered olivine.]\r\n\r\nA serpentine which occurs associated with amphibolite and various\r\nschists about three kilometres east of Gebel Erf el Fahid [10,360]\r\nmay possibly have been derived from a mica-peridotite. In the\r\nhand specimen it is a dark brown rock of dull aspect with greenish\r\npatches, and shows marked magnetic polarity. The sp. gr. is 2·63. The\r\nmicroscopic slide shows mainly colourless serpentine, but there are\r\nstrings and bundles of pale greenish-yellow chlorite, and specks and\r\nstrings of magnetite. The arrangement of the magnetite (_see_ Fig. 45)\r\nat once attracts attention, being frequently aggregated in parallel\r\nstrings reminding one of the cleavage of mica. Between crossed nicols\r\nthe chlorite is easily distinguished from the serpentine by its\r\nslightly higher polarisation-colours (low yellows as compared with\r\ngreys); and its arrangement in long leaves and bundles, with distinct\r\ntraces of the original mica, leaves no doubt as to its derivation\r\nfrom biotite. The parallel strings of magnetite are also most likely\r\ndue to alteration of biotite, for it is difficult to account for\r\ntheir peculiar arrangement otherwise; they are mostly separated by\r\nmaterial of lower double refraction than the chlorite above-mentioned,\r\nperhaps a variety of chlorite poorer in iron, owing to the previous\r\nseparation of the oxide. The clear serpentine which forms the bulk\r\nof the slide does not contain much iron oxide, and does not include\r\nany trace of the original mineral from which it has been formed;\r\nbut between crossed nicols it shows an irregular mesh structure\r\nwhich makes one almost certain of its derivation from olivine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.—Serpentine, probably derived from\r\nlherzolite, Wadi Um Khariga [10,368], × 17. _so_, serpentine derived\r\nfrom olivine; _sb_ and _sd_ serpentine probably derived from bronzite\r\nand diallage; _c_, calcite; _p_, picotite; _m_, magnetite.]\r\n\r\nThe serpentine of the hills on the west side of the Wadi Um Khariga\r\n[10,368] is remarkable in the field by its foxy red colour on all\r\nexposed surfaces. The rock, which has a sp. gr. of 2·63, is nearly\r\nblack on fractured surfaces, and no crystals can be detected in\r\nit. The slide shows colourless to yellow serpentine, with a fair\r\namount of calcite often arranged along cracks, a liberal sprinkling\r\nof magnetite, and one or two fairly large grains of picotite,\r\nor chromite. In some parts of the slide the serpentine shows an\r\nirregular mesh structure between crossed nicols; these portions,\r\nin which the magnetite-granules show an irregular honeycomb-like\r\narrangement, are doubtless altered olivine. In other places the\r\nserpentine polarises in clear greys with a fibrous aspect, and\r\nthe magnetite is arranged in parallel lines; calcite is typically\r\ndeveloped in these fibrous portions, sometimes along the cleavages\r\nand sometimes in irregular patches. The fibrous-looking serpentine\r\nprobably represents the alteration-products of both rhombic and\r\nmonoclinic pyroxenes, and the parent rock was thus a medium-grained\r\nlherzolite, containing olivine, diallage, bronzite and picotite.\r\n\r\nIn the hills on the east side of the Wadi Um Khariga, about in\r\nlatitude 24° 55′, there is some serpentine which has apparently\r\nresulted from the alteration of very basic dykes. The sp. gr. is\r\n2·65. A slide cut from this rock [10,367] shows the same clear\r\nfibrous-looking patches as the specimen last described, and picotite,\r\nin a confused and nearly isotropic mass of fine fibres of serpentine,\r\nwith but little magnetite and no calcite. No original mineral remains\r\nexcept the picotite. The clearer fibrous patches may represent\r\ndiallage or bronzite, while the rest of the serpentine is somewhat\r\ndoubtfully referred to olivine. There is some trace of banding in\r\nthe rock, perhaps due to movement during consolidation.\r\n\r\nA serpentine approaching an ophicalcite [10,376] forms the main\r\nrock at Gebel Ghadir, where it is associated with a peculiar quartz\r\nfelsite resembling granulite. In the mass the rock, which has a\r\nsp. gr. of 2·67, is black to green, veined with calcite; surfaces\r\nof the debris are often covered with a brilliant green glaze. The\r\nmicroscopic slide reveals an irregular mixture of nearly colourless\r\nserpentine and cloudy-looking calcite, with abundant specks and a\r\nfew larger granules of slightly translucent deep-brown chromite or\r\npicotite. Between crossed nicols, the serpentine is a mass of fibres\r\nand little plates, in which a strong tendency to linear arrangement\r\ncan be seen, and here and there a lattice-structure. Though none\r\nof the original mineral remains there is not much doubt that the\r\nrock is an altered amphibolite or basic diorite; the calcite is\r\npossibly derived from the alteration of an original lime felspar,\r\nbut it has been largely redistributed in the crushed rock by solution\r\nand redeposition.\r\n\r\nThe serpentine forming the hills on the north side of the mouth of\r\nWadi Kalalat is a dark reddish-brown rock, of sp. gr. 2·76, in which\r\nshining crystalline specks of olivine can be seen. It has doubtless\r\nresulted from the alteration of a dunite, or rock consisting almost\r\nentirely of olivine. The slide [11,510] shows the rock still to\r\ncontain abundant clear colourless kernels of the original olivine,\r\nin a mesh-work of pale olive-brown serpentine. The serpentinisation\r\nhas taken place along irregular cracks in the olivine, each crack\r\nbeing generally marked by a thin streak of opaque iron oxide\r\nrunning longitudinally down its centre, with serpentine fibres\r\nrunning crosswise and filling the rest of the crack. Where the\r\nkernels first left have themselves become changed to serpentine,\r\nthey are nearly isotropic, while the cracks polarise in clear greys,\r\nso that even where the whole of a crystal has been serpentinised the\r\nstructure is still clear, both in ordinary light by the magnetite\r\nstrings, and in polarised light by the way in which the serpentine\r\nof the cracks stands out from the more isotropic patches within the\r\nmeshes. There is a little accessory diallage, easily recognisable by\r\nits fibrous appearance and the oblique extinction of its unaltered\r\nportions. The diallage, like the olivine, is passing into serpentine,\r\nbut here the serpentine goes on along cleavage planes as well as\r\nalong irregular cross cracks, giving the partially altered crystals\r\na striped appearance between crossed nicols. Where the diallage has\r\nbecome entirely serpentinised, it can still be differentiated by its\r\nclearer appearance from the olivine-serpentine in ordinary light,\r\nand by its striated structure between crossed nicols; but of course\r\nunless kernels of the original mineral are left one cannot be sure\r\nwhether it was diallage or bronzite. There are a few patches of\r\ncalcite or magnesite, and veinlets of the same secondary minerals;\r\nthese may have arisen from the alteration of a little original\r\nfelspar, or from the diallage.\r\n\r\nNear the head of Wadi Arais, to the south of Gebel Um Bisilla,\r\nthere are some dykes of dark magnetic rock of sp. gr. 2·56. A\r\nspecimen from one of these dykes [11,519], turns out on microscopic\r\nexamination to be a schistose serpentine. It is traversed by parallel\r\nstrings of opaque and brown translucent iron oxides, and granules of\r\nmagnetite are also scattered over the interspaces. The interspaces\r\nbetween the iron oxide strings are filled with serpentine showing no\r\nrecognisable structures, but containing here and there little nests\r\nof clouded green hornblende, suggesting the possibility of the rock\r\nbeing an altered basic diorite or amphibolite.\r\n\r\nThe highly crushed and rotten serpentine which forms the high and\r\nsteep-sided mountain mass of Gebel Abu Dahr, differs considerably in\r\ncomposition in different parts. The most typical form of the rock,\r\nwhich has a sp. gr. of 2·77, is a dark brown serpentine with little\r\nstrings of olive-green matter, and occasionally large dulled black\r\ncrystals. A slide [11,516 A], cut from this portion of the rock\r\nshows mostly olivine, altering to serpentine in the usual manner\r\nwith abundant clear kernels of the original mineral. Associated with\r\nthe olivine is another mineral of a somewhat fibrous aspect, altered\r\npartly to serpentine and partly to another substance which polarises\r\nas a confused aggregate of fibres and flakes in brilliant colours,\r\nthe flakes extinguishing with slight obliquity; the serpentine is\r\nformed mainly along the vertical cleavages of the mineral (though it\r\nalso fills transverse irregular cracks), while the other substance\r\n(tremolite?) fills up interspaces. In some parts of the mass the\r\nrock has a blacker colour and a slightly higher density (2·87),\r\nsomewhat resembling a basalt with large greenish fibrous-looking\r\ncrystals scattered sparsely through it. The slide cut from this form\r\nof the rock [11,516 B] shows no olivine whatever, practically the\r\nwhole slide being composed of the fibrous mineral just described,\r\ntogether with a little nearly colourless fibrous hornblende, in\r\nwhich the change above-mentioned appears to be going on. Thus it\r\nwould seem likely that the rock of Gebel Abu Dahr is essentially\r\nan altered hornblende-picrite (or olivine-hornblende rock) with\r\nvariations towards dunite (olivine-rock) on the one hand, and towards\r\nan amphibolite or hornblende-rock on the other. The alteration of\r\nhornblende here is not a purely serpentinous one, but results in\r\nthe formation first of serpentine along cracks and cleavage planes,\r\nand then of a tremolitic mineral in the interspaces. It is worth\r\nremark, moreover, that in the slide free from olivine the change to\r\ntremolite preponderates, and there is much less serpentine in the\r\naltered hornblende than in the slide containing olivine; this suggests\r\nthat the presence of the neighbouring olivine has in some way brought\r\nabout more serpentine in the hornblende, perhaps by actual forcing of\r\nserpentine from the expanding olivine into cracks in the hornblende,\r\nor by the influence of pressure set up by the same expansion.\r\n\r\nIn the serpentine from some low hills on the plain a little to\r\nthe east of Bir Abraq [11,506] we have a rock evidently derived\r\nfrom a dunite, though not a trace of unaltered olivine remains. The\r\nsp. gr. is 2·61. The microscopic slide consists of nearly colourless\r\nserpentine with strings of magnetite marking the cracks along which\r\nits formation began (_see_ Fig. 47). Between crossed nicols (_see_\r\nFig. 48) the main portion of the serpentine, doubtless derived\r\nfrom olivine, presents a very remarkable appearance; most of the\r\npolygonal spaces between the magnetite-meshwork are lined with plates\r\nof clear serpentine, while the centre is occupied by nearly isotropic\r\nmaterial. Thus the slide in polarised light presents somewhat the\r\naspect of an aggregate of cells with dark nuclei. Besides olivine, the\r\nslide shows a small amount of a fibrous mineral, probably bronzite,\r\nwhich is likewise almost entirely altered to serpentine, though a\r\nfew original fibres remain; the magnetite grains in the serpentine\r\nderived from this mineral is typically aggregated in strings parallel\r\nto the fibres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.—Serpentine derived from an almost pure\r\nolivine-rock, from a low hill east of Bir Abraq [11,506], × 17. The\r\noutlines of the original olivine crystals (_o_) and the cracks in\r\nthem are marked by granules and strings of magnetite. A serpentinised\r\ncrystal of bronzite is seen at _b_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.—A small portion of the serpentine derived\r\nfrom olivine in the same slide, viewed between crossed nicols under\r\na higher power, showing the cellular structure.]\r\n\r\nA serpentine rock found associated with fine-grained diorite at\r\nGebel Um Tenedba [11,517 B] may have been derived from an olivine\r\ndiabase poor in felspar. The rocks in this locality are highly\r\naltered and crushed, and frequently more or less schistose. In a\r\nslide cut from the serpentine of the lower part of the mountain,\r\nwhich has a sp. gr. of 2·71, all the original minerals of the\r\nrock have been replaced by alteration products. The main portion\r\nof the slide is probably altered augite; it consists of serpentine\r\nwith fairly distinct mesh structure in which iron oxides are very\r\nabundant in clots and strings. Some patches, which show a more uniform\r\ngrey aspect under crossed nicols, are doubtfully referred to altered\r\nfelspar. Smaller areas, usually free from iron oxide grains and mostly\r\nconsisting of almost isotropic serpentine with a substance polarising\r\nin low yellow tints running along irregular cracks in all directions,\r\nare believed to represent altered olivine; one of these areas is\r\nnearly filled with little brushes of the substance just mentioned,\r\ngiving it almost a spherulitic appearance as the nicols are rotated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.—Serpentine, derived from wehrlite, Gebel\r\nGerf [12,128], × 17. _s_, serpentine (mainly altered olivine, with\r\nstrings of magnetite); _o_, unaltered olivine, mixed with granules\r\nof augite; _d_, diallage.]\r\n\r\nThe predominant rock of the mountain mass of Gebel Gerf [12,128] is\r\na serpentine apparently derived from a wehrlite or olivine-diallage\r\nrock. In the hand specimen, it is a rather heavy black rock\r\n(sp. gr. 2·75) with small pea-green spots and a few small bronzy and\r\nglassy looking crystals here and there. The microscopic slide (_see_\r\nFig. 49) shows the olivine to be largely altered to serpentine in\r\nthe ordinary manner with separation of magnetite, but some granules\r\nof the original mineral remain, especially aggregated, together\r\nwith augite granules, round the diallage crystals. The diallage is\r\ntolerably fresh, and easily recognisable by its fine striation and\r\noblique extinction. Besides the diallage, there is some ordinary\r\naugite, not always very easily distinguishable from the unaltered\r\nolivine owing to its cleavage not being very marked. Some of the\r\ndiallage crystals show undulose extinction as the result of strain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.—Serpentinisation of bronzite, as seen\r\nin a serpentine derived from bronzite-rock, Gebel Gerf [12,119],\r\nunder a high power between crossed nicols. The clearer portions\r\nof the figure are unaltered portions of a single large crystal of\r\nbronzite; the serpentine is seen forming mainly along the cleavages\r\nof the original mineral, with subsidiary cross-fibres.]\r\n\r\nAt many points the serpentine of Gebel Gerf contains a great\r\ndeal of bronzite, crystals of this mineral of typical aspect and\r\nmeasuring up to five millimetres diameter being visible in the hand\r\nspecimen scattered liberally through the duller serpentine. The\r\nsp. gr. of this portion of the mass is 2·81. The slide [12,119]\r\nshows practically nothing but bronzite altering to serpentine,\r\nso that locally the parent rock has been a pyroxenite rather than a\r\nperidotite. The serpentinisation of the bronzite has proceeded mainly\r\nalong the fibres of the original mineral, but there are numerous\r\ncross-fibres (_see_ Fig. 50), and here, as in the hornblende of the\r\nrock of Gebel Abu Dahr, the change to serpentine appears to have\r\nbeen accompanied by the production of tremolite. In another slide\r\n[12,127] the main constituent appears to be still bronzite, but\r\nhere it is of a pronounced olive-brown colour even in thin section,\r\nand is accompanied by some nearly colourless diallage; some of the\r\nolive-brown fibrous crystals show extinction-angles of a few degrees,\r\nand it is possible that these are hornblende.\r\n\r\nThough the greater part of the Gerf serpentine has been derived from\r\nrocks free, or practically free, from felspar, it is possible that\r\nthese were mixed with other rocks, such as gabbros and diabases, in\r\nwhich basic plagioclase formed an essential constituent. One of the\r\nspecimens brought back from the mountain [12,115], having a sp. gr. of\r\n2·67, is a somewhat wedge-shaped block, about ten centimetres square\r\nand four centimetres thick, covered entirely with the shining black\r\nto greenish glaze which is characteristic of shattered serpentine,\r\nexcept where chipped with the hammer to test its coherence and to\r\nlook for remains of crystals in it. The fractured surface is mostly\r\ndull and nearly black, with little strings and spots of greenish\r\nmatter and scattered shining specks. But although the block so\r\nthoroughly resembles a serpentine, the slide cut from it proves the\r\nrock to be a fine-grained diabase, consisting essentially of augite\r\nand plagioclase, with a good deal of iron oxide. The plagioclase\r\nis tolerably fresh, in lath-shaped forms still showing twinning\r\nvery clearly, while the augite is very clouded and is changing to\r\nhornblende and chlorite or serpentine. In the field nothing was\r\nnoted which would separate this rock from the rest of the mass,\r\nwhich it resembles almost perfectly in appearance, and whether the\r\ndiabase forms a dyke or sheet, or the specimen represents a fragment\r\nof diabase caught up by the magma, is not certain. A dyke of this\r\nmaterial, shattered and serpentinised on all the fractured surfaces,\r\nwould be indistinguishable from the surrounding serpentine. It is\r\neven possible, though not likely, that the diabase is not a separate\r\nintrusion, but merely a variation of the same plutonic mass which\r\nhas given origin to the main bulk of the serpentine.\r\n\r\nOther variations in the serpentine which point to parts of the Gerf\r\nmass having originally been of a gabbroid type, occur in the mountains\r\nround Bir Korbiai and Bir Meneiga. A specimen from near Bir Korbiai\r\n[12,125], is a greyish-black fine-grained rock full of little white\r\nand greenish specks and strings, with pale citron-green serpentinous\r\nmatter covering the slickensided surfaces of the fragments into which\r\nthe mass readily separates. The sp. gr. is 2·67. The microscopic\r\nslide shows serpentine with pronounced knitted structure in places,\r\nas though derived from augite, and considerable patches of calcite\r\nwhich may represent an original lime-felspar. The calcite has,\r\nhowever, been largely redistributed along cracks, where it is often\r\nmixed with extremely coarse fibres or plates of serpentine.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from the mountains round Bir Meneiga [12,104] is a\r\nhard dull slatey-grey rock with black streaks and spots; it is\r\nstrongly magnetic and shows a tendency to schistose structure. The\r\nsp. gr. is 2·54. On examination with a lens the grey matter has\r\nin places something of a resemblance to saussuritised felspar. The\r\nslide cut from this specimen contains no original minerals. The\r\nbulk of it seems to be composed of very minute fibres or plates,\r\ngenerally showing a distinctly parallel arrangement along the planes\r\nof schistosity, but exhibiting knitted structure in places, and thus\r\nprobably consisting in part of kaolinic matter derived from altered\r\nfelspar, and in part of serpentinous matter derived from alteration\r\nof augite; while scattered through the slide are abundant patches and\r\nstrings of calcite and magnetite. The rock is too intensely crushed\r\nand altered for one to be certain of its origin, but it appears to\r\nhave been originally a diabase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.—Serpentine derived from alteration of\r\nharzburgite, Gebel Korabkansi [12,140], × 17. _s_, serpentine,\r\nmostly formed from olivine; _o_, unaltered olivine; _b_, altering\r\nbronzite; _c_, chromite or magnetite, enveloping olivine.]\r\n\r\nThe serpentine of Gebel Korabkansi, to the west of Gebel Gerf,\r\nis an altered olivine-bronzite rock (harzburgite) of moderately\r\ncoarse grain. A slide [12,140] cut from the least altered portion,\r\nwhere the sp. gr. of the rock is 2·72, shows olivine to have been the\r\nmost abundant constituent; it is largely serpentinised in the typical\r\nmanner, but abundant kernels remain unaltered. Mixed with the olivine\r\ncrystals are others of a fibrous mineral, altered partly to serpentine\r\nand partly to a confused mass of tremolite fibres; in the few cases\r\nwhere any of the original material remains, this fibrous mineral shows\r\nstraight extinction, and is probably bronzite. The alteration of the\r\npyroxene has here proceeded more rapidly than that of the olivine. The\r\npyroxenic mineral is easily picked out in the slide by ordinary light,\r\nowing to the fact that the olivine has altered to greenish-yellow\r\nserpentine, while the mixed material produced from the pyroxene\r\nis of a dirty-white aspect. Another slide from Gebel Korabkansi\r\n[12,112] exhibits in places mesh-structure with clear kernels which\r\nextinguish very obliquely to the meshes, showing augite or diallage\r\nalso to have been a constituent of the parent rock; and there is\r\na single ragged-looking crystal of dark green fibrous hornblende,\r\naltering to nearly colourless serpentine. The sp. gr. of the specimen\r\nfrom which this latter slide was cut is 2·63. Both the slides from\r\nGebel Korabkansi are rather poor in iron oxides, but there are a\r\nfew irregular crystals of chromite, generally enveloping olivine.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =Alteration Products of Serpentine. Magnesite and Asbestos.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many of the serpentine-masses the effects of solution and pressure\r\ncan be traced in the formation of veins and pockets of magnesite,\r\nasbestos, and occasionally talc in the rock. Magnesite veinlets\r\nare frequently seen, for instance, round about Bir Meneiga [12,142]\r\nand Bir Muqur, while asbestos has been found in pieces of several\r\nkilogrammes weight in the Wadi Sherefa el Sherqi [12,122] and near\r\nBir Muqur [12,153]. At the last-named locality it occurs along the\r\ncrush-planes of the serpentine, and appears to be preceded by the\r\nformation of long fibres of a green substance.[133] Where thickest,\r\nthe glaze on the slickensided surfaces of the serpentine fragments\r\nseems to consist of this same green substance, which splits into hard\r\nfibres often reaching ten centimetres or more in length and only a few\r\nmillimetres in diameter [12,153 A] and these hard fibres, which have\r\na sp. gr. of 2·64, break up gradually, apparently under weathering\r\ninfluences, into the much finer and more flexible fibres of white\r\nasbestos. The quality of the asbestos is, however, inferior, for a\r\nspecimen of the softest kind sent to London for an expert opinion,\r\nwas reported to be of no commercial value; even had it been otherwise,\r\nthe quantity seen was too small to justify working, though of course\r\na thorough search among the mountains might reveal the presence of\r\nbigger deposits than were encountered during the survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: From _Marwa_, the Arabic term for quartz.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: The numbers in square brackets in this and the\r\nfollowing chapter are the registration numbers of the specimens in\r\nthe Geological Museum, Cairo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: I may here recall that the quartz mass which\r\nconstitutes the so-called “alabaster” quarry north of Aswân,\r\nand for which I have inferred an igneous origin, is likewise closely\r\nassociated with aplitic or pegmatitic intrusions.

The\r\nirregular way in which the metamorphic rocks alternate with those\r\nof the igneous and sedimentary groups will be better appreciated\r\nby a reference to the geological map on Plate XX than by any verbal\r\ndescription. As a whole, the metamorphic rocks represent the remains\r\nof a complex of igneous and sedimentary deposits which were laid\r\ndown in remote geological periods; subsequently these deposits\r\nwere crushed, folded, and elevated into mountains, their original\r\nstructures being largely obliterated in the dynamical process;\r\nin succeeding ages the metamorphosed complex was penetrated by the\r\ngreat granitic and other intrusions which have been described in\r\nthe preceding chapter, and then planed down by denudation as an\r\nold land surface before being wholly or in part submerged beneath\r\nthe waters of the Cretaceous sea in which the Nubian sandstone was\r\ndeposited. The elevation of the land after the Cretaceous period\r\nwas accompanied by further folding which must have increased the\r\ndegree of metamorphism of the rocks; but it is most probable that\r\nthe forces which produced these post-Cretaceous movements were of\r\nless intensity and duration than those of more ancient periods,\r\nand we may regard the metamorphic character of the older rocks\r\nas having been for the most part impressed on them in Archæan,\r\nor at latest in Palæozoic times. It is not impossible that some\r\nof the more highly foliated gneisses may even have been parts of\r\nthe primitive crust of consolidation of the earth, while the clay\r\nschists may be the remains of the very earliest sediments.\r\n\r\nBesides the evidences of dynamo-metamorphism above-mentioned, we find\r\noccasionally traces of contact-metamorphism, where igneous dykes\r\nhave locally altered the rocks into which they have intruded; but,\r\nin general, the subsequent compression of the masses has obliterated\r\nthese traces, and the effects of contact-metamorphism are negligible\r\nin comparison with those produced by dynamic action.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic rocks occurring in this part of Egypt may be\r\nclassified as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Gneisses.=\r\n\r\n  _Granite-gneiss_ (crushed granite).\r\n\r\n  _Diorite-gneiss_ (crushed diorite).\r\n\r\n  _Highly foliated gneisses_ (in which all traces of primitive\r\n  structure have been obliterated by foliation and recrystallization).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Schists.=\r\n\r\n  _Quartz-schists_ (in some cases probably metamorphosed sandstone,\r\n  in others crushed aplitic rocks).\r\n\r\n  _Clay-schists_ (metamorphosed clays).\r\n\r\n  _Hornblende-schists and crushed volcanic rocks._\r\n\r\n  _Hornfels_ (metamorphosed acid lavas).\r\n\r\n  _Mica-schists_ (sometimes containing beryl and tourmaline).\r\n\r\n  _Chlorite-schists._\r\n\r\n  _Talc-schists._\r\n\r\n  _Calcareous schists and marble._\r\n\r\n  _Graphite-schists._\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Breccias.=\r\n\r\n  _Fluidal breccias_, in which broken fragments of solid rock have\r\n  been included in an intrusive magma.\r\n\r\n  _Breccias proper_, formed by fracture and recementing together\r\n  of fragments without fusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Mineral Veins.=\r\n\r\n  _Quartz veins_ (sometimes containing gold and traces of copper).\r\n\r\n  _Calcite veins_ (with more or less chalybite).\r\n\r\n  _Magnesite veins_ (in serpentine).\r\n\r\n  _Asbestos veins_ (in serpentine).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Gneisses.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous occurrence of gneiss in South-Eastern Egypt is\r\nthe great mass which extends from Gebel Mudergeg and Gebel Migif in\r\nthe north, down the range of Gebel Hafafit, and along the greater part\r\nof the Wadi Gemal. With this mass is closely connected another stretch\r\nof gneiss to the south of Gebel Abu Khrug; the hills which rise from\r\nthe sandy plain round the head of Wadi Natash are mostly gneiss, so\r\nthat the gneiss is probably continuous across the plain except where\r\nit is penetrated by the syenitic cones called El Nahud. The total\r\narea covered by gneiss in this locality alone is some two thousand\r\nsquare kilometres, and includes some remarkable mountain masses,\r\nsuch as Gebels Migif and Hafafit.\r\n\r\nOther gneissose areas of less extent occur round Bir Abu Beid and to\r\nthe south-west of Gebel Hamrat el Feg; while still smaller areas are\r\nfound in the hills to the north-west of Berenice, in the remarkable\r\ntriple-headed mountain called Gebel Um Rasein, and to the north of\r\nBir Um Bishtit.\r\n\r\nGneiss typically forms bold scenery of precipitous hills, the\r\ncolour of which varies with the composition of the rock, from pink\r\nto grey. At Gebel Migif one ascends the mountain most easily by the\r\nnorthern slopes, which are formed by the foliation-planes of the\r\nrock, while to the south these are cut across by sheer precipices;\r\nthe same is the case at Gebel Um Rasein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.—Granite-gneiss, Gebel Um Rasein [12,108],\r\nviewed between crossed nicols, × 30. _q_, quartz; _ol_, oligoclase;\r\n_or_, orthoclase; _h_, hornblende; _m_, “mortar” of crushed\r\nquartz and felspar between the larger crystals. The black areas are\r\nquartz in the position of extinction.]\r\n\r\nOf gneisses evidently produced by the deformation of granite, we\r\nmay take the rock of Gebel Um Rasein [12,108][134] as a type. The\r\nbulk of the mountain is formed of a nearly white acid rock, of\r\nsp. gr. 2·67, with dark spots, resembling the granite of Gebel\r\nElba in appearance, except that here the dark minerals have a marked\r\narrangement along definite planes. (Compare the coloured figures of\r\nthe two rocks on Plates XXII and XXV). In places the rock contains\r\nthin bands of almost pure biotite, and these are often thrown into\r\nsharp contortions by the strong compression which the mass has\r\nundergone. The strike of the foliation-planes in Gebel Um Rasein\r\nitself is about south-south-east, with a dip of about 20° to the\r\neast-north-east, but the strike swings round to about south at the\r\nsouth end of the mass, and the inclination of the foliation-planes\r\nbecome much steeper. The gneiss shows very marked pitting due to\r\nweathering, the holes ranging from a few centimetres to a metre or\r\nmore in diameter and depth. A microscopic section of the rock shows\r\nit to be essentially an acid hornblende-granite similar to that of\r\nGebel Elba, but crushed so that there is a “mortar” of broken up\r\nquartz and felspar between the larger crystals, and the larger where\r\nunbroken frequently show undulose extinction as the result of strain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.—Diorite-gneiss, Wadi Nugrus [10,386], ×\r\n17. _h_, hornblende, with small enclosures of felspar and sphene;\r\n_pl_, plagioclase felspar; _b_, biotite; _q_, quartz; _ap_, apatite;\r\n_sp_, sphene.]\r\n\r\nIn the Wadis Nugrus and Gemal there is a great deal of strongly\r\nfoliated grey gneiss [10,386-7], derived from the intense crushing\r\nof diorites. A figure from a typical hand specimen of this gneiss,\r\nlooking at the edges of the foliation-planes, is given on Plate\r\nXXV. The sp. gr. of the rock is 2·88. The microscopic slides show\r\nplagioclase and green hornblende in about equal proportions, with\r\nsome quartz and small amounts of biotite, sphene, iron oxides, and\r\napatite. The hornblende is very fresh-looking, in strongly pleochroic\r\n(yellowish to deep blue-green) straggling crystals, aggregated\r\ntogether along the foliation-planes; the crystals, though variously\r\noriented, show a tendency to lie with their cleavages in the direction\r\nof foliation. A very striking feature of the slides is the abundance\r\nof small grains of enclosed felspar in the hornblende, giving\r\nthe green crystals a perforated appearance in ordinary light. The\r\nfelspars, which are likewise fairly fresh, are much smashed up,\r\nforming with the quartz a mosaic between the irregular bands of\r\nhornblende; the grains often show undulose extinction. Biotite,\r\nof a warm brown colour where not bleached, is sparingly mixed with\r\nthe hornblende. The sphene is in small rounded grains, mixed with,\r\nand sometimes containing, granules of ilmenite; the grains show a\r\ntendency to form little aggregates, sometimes in the hornblende,\r\nand sometimes in the felspathic portions of the slide. One or two\r\nstumpy grains of apatite are enclosed in the felspars, but this\r\nmineral is extremely scarce in the slides examined, and does not\r\nshow its usual long prismatic habit.\r\n\r\n                                                          =PLATE XXV.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ball.—Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\n=METAMORPHIC ROCKS.=\r\n\r\n=GRANITE-GNEISS.= Gebel Um Rasein.\r\n\r\n=RED GNEISS.= Gebel Abu Beid.\r\n\r\n=DIORITE-GNEISS.= Wadi Nugrus.\r\n\r\n=GREEN BRECCIA.= Gebel Hamata.\r\n\r\n=EMERALD AND QUARTZ IN MICA-SCHIST.= Gebel Sikait.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\nAs an example of gneisses in which the foliation is so intense that\r\nall original structures have been obliterated by recrystallization,\r\nwe may take the red gneiss of the Abu Beid Hills [10,659], of which\r\na coloured natural size representation is given on Plate XXV. In\r\nthis rock, which has a sp. gr. of 2·65, the main constituent is\r\na pink felspar, mixed with a little quartz and arranged in fine\r\nlenticles separated by greenish laminæ which are doubtless altering\r\nbiotite. This rock bears a strong resemblance to the well-known\r\nred gneiss of the Erzgebirge, which, from its chemical composition,\r\nis usually believed to be a metamorphosed granite poor in mica.\r\n\r\nGrey gneisses, equally intensely foliated with the Abu Beid rock,\r\noccur in the range of Gebel Hafafit; these contain a much larger\r\nproportion of biotite, and remind one of the grey gneisses of the\r\nFreiberg district. But as no analyses have yet been made of the\r\nEgyptian rocks, the absolute similarity to those of the Erzgebirge\r\nis not quite certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   =Quartzites and Quartz-schists.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout ten kilometres south of Gebel Abu Gurdi is a tract of low\r\nhills and ridges composed mainly of quartz-schists. The limits\r\nof these rocks have not been mapped, but they appear to cover a\r\nsomewhat elliptical area with its long axis, measuring some eight or\r\nten kilometres, pointing east and west. Where first encountered,\r\nat a point about twelve kilometres east of Gebel Selaia, on\r\nthe march from that hill towards the pass into the head of Wadi\r\nLahami, the rocks strongly resemble rather friable white to brown\r\nfine-grained sandstones, with bedding planes dipping about 35° to\r\nthe north. The rock [10,413] consists almost entirely of white or\r\nslightly iron-stained quartz grains, with, in places, scattered\r\nminute dull black rods which are apparently hornblende. Traced\r\nfurther east, the rocks have more and more the character of\r\nquartz schists, with harder bands of quartzite, and the planes of\r\nseparation, which gradually become nearly horizontal, have more the\r\nappearance of foliation-planes. The harder quartzite bands [10,414]\r\nare usually brownish to greenish-white in colour, but sometimes take\r\non a purple tint, and show micaceous and chloritic scales on cleaved\r\nsurfaces; in some places the rock contains “eyes” of minette-like\r\ncomposition. To the south the bedding or cleavage planes seem to\r\nreverse their dip, this being now to the south as though there were\r\nan anticlinical fold in the mass. There is considerable mixture of\r\nother schists with the rocks, and dykes of diorite and pegmatite,\r\nas well as veins of quartz, are frequent. A dioritic dyke which\r\ncuts through the rocks at a point nine kilometres south-south-west\r\nof Gebel Abu Gurdi, and which is itself crushed almost into a\r\nhornblende-schist, has hardened and altered the quartzose rock on\r\neither side of it into a close-grained horny looking rock [10,415]\r\napparently containing a great deal of finely granular andalusite.\r\n\r\nThese quartz-schists may have arisen from the metamorphism either\r\nof sandstones, in which case the parts to the west of the tract\r\nare the least altered, or of fine-grained aplitic rocks, on which\r\nview the sandstone-like aspect of the western portion of the tract\r\nis due to weathering; the rock is certainly more highly weathered\r\nwhere it most resembles an unaltered sandstone, and the presence of\r\nhornblende and the “eyes” of micaceous matter are suggestive of\r\nigneous rock. From a consideration of all the evidence I was able\r\nto gather in a rapid march over the sea, however, I incline to the\r\nview that the rocks are altered sandstone older than the Nubian\r\nseries, and probably of about the same age as the ancient clays\r\nwhich gave rise to the clay-schists of Zabara and elsewhere. The\r\nrocks are completely detached from the nearest undoubted Nubian\r\nsandstone beds (which lie some forty kilometres to the south-west,\r\nbeyond Gebel Zergat Naam), and they are mixed with schists and veined\r\nand altered to a degree which is nowhere approached by beds known\r\nto be of the Nubian series. Still, it is just possible that the\r\nquartz-schists represent the remains of Nubian sandstone strata,\r\nfor the nearest beds of that series show-considerable folding and\r\nfaulting near Gebel Zergat Naam, and we should expect still greater\r\ndisturbance and alteration here near the main watershed and close\r\nto a principal axis of mountain elevation.\r\n\r\nA quartz-schist which is certainly derived from the metamorphism\r\nof aplitic dykes or sheets, occurs as great inclined bands cutting\r\nacross the Wadi Shenshef close to some old ruins. The main rock of the\r\ndistrict, in which the bands occur, is a medium-grained diorite. The\r\nquartz-schist is a greyish-white fissile rock, which splits easily\r\ninto great slabs; it has supplied an excellent building material\r\nfor the houses of the ruined town or encampment, being used not only\r\nfor the walls but also for lintels over doors and windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Clay-schists.=\r\n\r\n\r\nClay-schists cover extensive areas in the South-Eastern Desert. They\r\noccur abundantly in the high hills to the east of Gebel Nugrus and\r\nform a large portion of Gebel Zabara. They abound also to the south\r\nof Wadi Antar about the longitude of Gebel Um Goraf, in the hills\r\non the east side of Gebel Abu Dahr, in the Wadi Hodein round about\r\nwhere Wadi Um Tenedba joins it, in the hills flanking the sandstone\r\nplateau of Gebels Dif and Anfeib, at Gebels Kolaiqo and Eqrun,\r\non the western flanks of the serpentine mass of Gebel Meneiga,\r\nand in the low hills on the plain between Gebels Gerf and Korabkansi.\r\n\r\nClay-schists are typically of a grey colour, though greenish, purple,\r\nand reddish varieties occur. They are soft rocks, easily scratched\r\nwith a knife. In some places, as for instance at Gebel Zabara, they\r\nare practically slates, cleaving into slabs often of considerable\r\nsize, while in other localities, as for instance near Gebel Abu Dahr,\r\nthey are crushed into matchwood-like splinters, which can be used\r\nas slate-pencils. They are usually associated with other metamorphic\r\nrocks such as crushed diorites and hornblende and mica-schists. The\r\ndirection of foliation of the slaty and slabby forms is often\r\npersistent—at Gebel Zabara, for instance, a general south-easterly\r\ndip of about 28° is maintained over a considerable area; but there\r\nare numerous local variations, and the number of observations thus\r\nfar made is too small for any general conclusions to be drawn as to\r\nthe regional distribution of dip. On the whole, the clay-schists are\r\nremarkably free from knots or other irregularities, though knotted\r\nvarieties, doubtless the result of contact alteration, have been\r\nobserved on the south side of Wadi Seiga and at a few other places.\r\n\r\nThe clay-schists have probably for the most part been produced by\r\nthe metamorphism of ancient argillaceous sediments; in some places,\r\nas for instance in the Wadi Beida, a passage can be observed\r\ninto what appears to be a crushed conglomerate, while in other\r\nplaces they pass into quartzites which doubtless represent altered\r\nintercalated sandstones. The relation between the direction of the\r\nfoliation-planes and that of the original bedding is unknown; it\r\nwould appear likely that in most cases the traces of bedding have\r\nbeen entirely obliterated by pressure. Nor have any fossils been\r\nfound in the rocks, though a sharp look-out was kept in the more\r\nlikely-looking localities, so that the age of the beds is unknown. At\r\npresent I am inclined to regard them as most likely of Archæan age,\r\nantedating the great granitic intrusions; but further evidence,\r\neither in the finding of fossils or from a more careful study of\r\nthe field relations of these rocks to the others, is required before\r\none can be certain that they are of so great an antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n           =Hornblende-schists and Crushed Volcanic Rocks.=\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of hornblende-schists and crushed volcanic rocks are\r\nclassified a great variety of rocks, ranging in colour from green to\r\ngrey and almost black, in fissility from the finest lamellation to\r\nalmost massive forms in which the schistosity is barely evident in\r\nthe hand specimen, but all definable as fine-grained dark-coloured\r\nschistose rocks consisting largely either of hornblende or of its\r\nalteration products. Their origin is not always clear, but many of\r\nthem appear on microscopic examination to be altered fine-grained\r\nsyenites, diorites, and lavas, and it is probable that practically\r\nthe whole are altered forms of various intermediate and basic igneous\r\nrocks. The reason for including the hornblende-schists and crushed\r\nvolcanic rocks in one great group is the difficulty of separating\r\nthe different classes in the field. They pass one into the other,\r\nand many rocks which in the field would be put down as hornblendic\r\nturn out on detailed examination to contain little or none of that\r\nmineral, its place being taken by decomposition products.\r\n\r\nSchists of the types above defined occur probably more abundantly\r\nthan any other class of metamorphic rocks in the South-Eastern\r\nDesert. They enter largely into the composition of some of the\r\nmain mountain masses, such as those of Gebels Abu Hamamid and Abu\r\nGurdi, besides covering great expanses of lower hill country. In\r\nthe mountain ranges they rise in steep-sided ridges with knife edge\r\nsummits, a good idea of which is given by the photograph of Gebel Abu\r\nHamamid on Plate VII. In the lower hill country we have typically a\r\ndreary confused looking waste of thousands of dark hills and ridges\r\nseparated by small winding wadis; sometimes there is a semblance of\r\nsystem in the distribution of the hills, owing to the occurrence\r\nof parallel dykes harder than the schists which they penetrate,\r\nforming thus back-bones for long lines of schist-ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.—Schist produced by crushing of syenite,\r\nnear Gebel el Anbat (Wadi Hodein). [11,532 B], × 30. _f_, crushed\r\nand clouded felspar, probably orthoclase; _lc_, mixture of calcite\r\nand limonite, produced by alteration of hornblende, no trace of\r\nwhich remains.]\r\n\r\n=Schist derived from Syenite.=—Among the schists occurring\r\nnear Gebel el Anbat, near the Wadi Hodein, is one which appears\r\nto be a crushed and altered syenite. It is a speckled grey and\r\nreddish-brown rock with a dull and rather granular fracture, of\r\nsp. gr. 2·92. The slide [11,532 B] shows a rather coarse granitic\r\nmixture of clouded felspar and heavily iron-stained calcite. The\r\nfelspar is considerably altered, showing no twinning, but between\r\ncrossed nicols it extinguishes in irregular bands and is seen to\r\nbe much crushed. The ferruginous and calcareous matter is almost\r\ncertainly altered hornblende; it forms irregular masses, in which the\r\niron oxide is mostly arranged in parallel lines as though along the\r\ncleavage planes of the parent mineral, while a clouded calcite fills\r\nup the spaces between the lines. It would seem that in addition to\r\npressure, carbonic acid has been the main agent of metamorphism here,\r\nthe ferro-magnesian silicate being attacked and its silica entirely\r\nremoved, while the aluminous silicate of the felspar has remained\r\nto some extent unchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.—Hornblende-schist (probably a metamorphosed\r\nfine-grained diorite), Wadi Muelih [10,357], × 40. _h_, pale green\r\nhornblende; _f_, mass of decomposed felspar, containing abundance of\r\nfinely acicular hornblende and some little patches of quartz mosaic;\r\n_m_, magnetite.]\r\n\r\n=Schists derived from Diorites.=—Hornblendic schists which appear\r\nto have been produced by the metamorphism of fine-grained diorites\r\noccur largely in the low hill country round the upper parts of\r\nthe Wadi Muelih, and in the mountain mass of Gebel Abu Gurdi. A\r\nspecimen of the less altered rock from the Wadi Muelih [10,357] is\r\na fine-grained hard grey basaltic-looking rock, of sp. gr. 3·04,\r\nin which the schistosity in not very evident, though it is well seen\r\nin the mass. The microscopic slide shows pale green hornblende in\r\nragged fibrous forms in a matted-looking clouded ground mass made up\r\nof finely acicular green hornblende and plagioclase, with a little\r\nquartz and orthoclase and a few grains of magnetite. Hornblende fibres\r\nare often enclosed in the decomposing felspars, which rarely show\r\ndefinite outlines and appear much shattered. The quartz is probably\r\nof secondary formation, occurring as little patches of mosaic.\r\n\r\nThe schist which forms the summit of Gebel Abu Gurdi [10,416]\r\nis probably also a crushed and altered diorite; it is a rather\r\nfine-grained hard greenish-grey rock, which with a lens can be seen\r\nto be a mixture of greenish-white felspathic material and dark\r\nhornblende; the felspar is mostly dull, while the hornblende, on\r\nthe other hand, is frequently in shining crystals. The sp. gr. of\r\nthe rock is 3·02. The microscopic slide shows the hornblende\r\nto be of a very pale green colour, in large irregular crystals,\r\noften including felspars. The felspar appears to be plagioclase;\r\nit is typically in smaller crystals than the hornblende, with a\r\nstrongly marked tendency to idiomorphism, highly cracked and almost\r\nentirely changed to kaolin. Some rather large straggling crystals\r\nof a dark brown clouded and semi-opaque highly refracting mineral,\r\nwhite by reflected light, are perhaps altered sphene. Round the\r\nlarger crystals is more finely crystalline matter, much clouded,\r\napparently composed of altered felspar and hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe crushed dioritic dykes already mentioned as cutting the\r\nquartz-schist to the south-west of Gebel Abu Gurdi are possibly\r\noffshoots from the same magma which formed the main mass of the\r\nmountain. Specimen [10,415], taken from one of these dykes, is a\r\nfine-grained grey rock, of sp. gr. 2·93, with an even more decided\r\nschistosity than that of the main mountain. The microscopic slide\r\nshows clear hornblende of a green colour, strongly pleochroic\r\n(greenish-yellow to blue-green) in irregular grains which are\r\nfrequently aggregated into nests and strings running in the direction\r\nof foliation of the rock; the remaining material is a mosaic of\r\nclear quartz, clouding kaolin, and sericite, presumably representing\r\naltered felspar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.—Schist composed of fragments of various\r\nvolcanic rocks, summit of Gebel Abu Hamamid [10,397], × 30.]\r\n\r\n=Schists formed by crushing of Volcanic Rocks.=—Schists derived\r\nfrom the crushing of volcanic rocks are very abundant in the mountains\r\nround Gebel Abu Hamamid and in the Wadi Beida. Typical specimens from\r\nthe summit of Gebel Abu Hamamid [10,397] are hard green to grey rocks,\r\nof sp. gr. 2·7, breaking with a rough dull fracture. With a lens,\r\nspots and strings of dull white matter, with ill-defined outlines, are\r\nseen in a green to nearly black ground mass. The microscopic slides\r\nshow the rock to be a breccia rather than a simple crushed rock,\r\nfor in the same slide very various structures can be seen. Some\r\nportions, evidently andesitic, consist of perfectly idiomorphic\r\nlath-shaped felspars scattered with a little decomposed hornblende\r\nin a glassy brown ground mass. Others, more abundant, seem to be\r\naltered quartz-diorite-porphyrite; in these parts, porphyritic quartz\r\nand orthoclase crystals, in forms strongly inclined to idiomorphism,\r\nclouded and strained, are scattered in a cryptocrystalline ground mass\r\ncontaining a good deal of green chlorite and epidote. In other parts\r\nof the slide, again, the chief porphyritic constituent is formed\r\nby large green grains, which have evidently once been biotite or\r\nhornblende, but which now consist of chlorite. In yet other parts of\r\nthe rock we have fragments of devitrified glassy lava. The different\r\nparts, which are not always well outlined, are separated by schistose\r\nbands composed mainly of strings of chlorite and epidote. Whether the\r\nrock is a tuff, or a crushed conglomerate of igneous boulders and\r\npebbles, or due to complicated crushing of a series of contiguous\r\nigneous rocks _in situ_, is not quite clear. In some places,\r\nespecially about the Wadi el Sheikh, the schists look like crushed\r\nconglomerates, but these may possibly be rocks crushed _in situ_\r\nrather than accumulations of rolled fragments transported by streams.\r\n\r\nThe hornblende-schists which surround Gebel Zergat Naam are of a\r\npeculiar type of which the origin is not evident, but are possibly\r\naltered andesites. The typical rock [11,526] is a hard grey basaltic\r\none of sp. gr. 2·95, with a rusty-brown skin on exposed surfaces. The\r\nmicroscopic slide shows little plates and brushes of nearly colourless\r\nhornblende, liberally scattered in a clouded ground mass consisting\r\nmainly of hornblende fibres in radiating and dendritic groups, with\r\na small amount of kaolinic matter and a few grains of magnetite. The\r\nslide contains no distinct quartz, but possibly a small amount of this\r\nmineral may be present in very minute grains with the kaolinic matter.\r\n\r\nTo the metamorphism of andesitic lavas, too, are somewhat doubtfully\r\nascribed the grey and green schists of the Wadi Beida, which have\r\nspecific gravity of about 2·75. The slides from the grey variety\r\nof the schists [12,116 and 12,159] show a very fine-grained clouded\r\nrock, apparently a mosaic of quartz, kaolin, chlorite and sericite,\r\nwith larger scattered irregular plates of dark green chlorite. In\r\na pale green variety from the head of the wadi [12,111], there is\r\nless chlorite and a considerable amount of calcite.\r\n\r\n=Hornblende Schists of doubtful origin.=—In the more highly\r\nfoliated and harder varieties of hornblende schist, which are\r\ntypically of a darker colour than most of those already described,\r\nwe have rocks in which the process of re-crystallization has been\r\nso complete that no trace of the original rock remains. These rocks,\r\nwhich are true hornblende-schists in the narrowest sense of the term,\r\nare less abundant than the foregoing types, and generally occur as\r\ncomparatively narrow bands associated with gneisses and mica and talc\r\nschists. All the minerals in them being of secondary origin, they are\r\nusually in a quite fresh state, and fractured surfaces, examined with\r\na lens, exhibit a mass of glistening small crystals of hornblende,\r\nquartz, and felspar. The density is usually about 2·9. Microscopic\r\nslides show elongated crystals of clear green hornblende, strongly\r\npleochroic (pale yellowish-green to deep blue-green) arranged along\r\nthe planes of schistosity, separated by clear granules of quartz\r\nand a little felspar, with scattered magnetite grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.—Hornblende-schist, near Gebel Eqrun\r\n[12,117], × 30. _h_, hornblende; _q_, quartz; _m_, magnetite. A\r\nlittle felspar is present mixed with the quartz, from which it is\r\ndistinguishable only in polarised light.]\r\n\r\nNear Gebel Eqrun are found hornblende-schists which exhibit a curious\r\nbanding in planes at right angles to the main foliation, in the form\r\nof darker lenticular stripes a few millimetres wide and about the\r\nsame distance apart. A slide [12,117] cut from this variety shows\r\nlittle trace of the banding, the lighter spaces between the dark\r\nbands merely showing a clouding of the quartz and felspar by tiny\r\ngranules of epidote. The stripes are most probably the consequence of\r\na secondary compression in a direction perpendicular to the original\r\none rather than relics of a banded structure in the parent rock.\r\n\r\n=Actinolite-schists.=—Very beautiful bright green schists, in which\r\nthe hornblende is in the fibrous to silky form called actinolite,\r\noccur in small quantity associated with mica and talc schists at\r\nSikait [10,380] and elsewhere. In these rocks the actinolite fibres,\r\nwhich often reach two centimetres in length, are generally aggregated\r\ninto bundles, with radiating structure. In the microscopic slide\r\nthe rock presents even a more beautiful appearance than in the mass,\r\nthe long fibres of actinolite polarising in the most brilliant tints;\r\nassociated with the actinolite, there is nearly always more or less\r\nchlorite and talc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Hornfels.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociated with the schists of Gebel Abu Hamamid and the neighbouring\r\nmountains there are great masses of very hard horny-looking rock\r\n[10,401] of green to grey colour, breaking with a sub-conchoidal\r\nfracture, and of such close texture as to appear homogeneous even\r\nwith a strong lens. The pyramidal peak called Gebel Um Semiuki, which\r\nrises to 1,282 metres above sea, three kilometres to the north-east\r\nof Gebel Abu Hamamid, is almost entirely composed of rocks of this\r\ntype; in the mountain faces the rock looks red, but this is only\r\ndue to a film covering weathered surfaces, the interior being of\r\na green to grey colour. The rock, which has a sp. gr. of 2·71, is\r\nfrequently beautifully banded, light and dark layers alternating with\r\neach other, and often contains tiny cubes of pyrites [10,399]. The\r\nmicroscopic slide from Gebel Um Semiuki shows a very fine-grained\r\nclouded compact rock, apparently consisting of glassy matter with\r\nminute granules of quartz and altered felspar, together with a little\r\nsericite, the latter especially along certain bands. The slide from\r\nGebel Abu Hamamid is similar, but here the granules of quartz and\r\nfelspar are a little larger, though they are still too small to be\r\nseen with a lens in the hand specimen; the appearance is that of\r\na quartz felsite on a small scale. It has already been mentioned\r\n(p. 281) that the quartz felsites of Gebels Igli and Hadarba pass\r\ngradually into hornfels, and when we remember that the schists of the\r\nAbu Hamamid district are mostly crushed volcanic rocks, it becomes\r\nalmost certain that the hornfels associated with them is a crushed\r\nand devitrified glassy lava of acid composition.\r\n\r\nA yellowish horny rock with grey streaks [10,379], which occurs near\r\nGebel Sabahia, is conspicuous in the field owing to its weathered\r\nsurfaces being covered with a bright red ferruginous skin, resembling\r\ncinnabar in colour. The sp. gr. is 2·52. Examination with a lens\r\nshows the grey streaks to be filled with myriads of brilliant yellow\r\nspecks of pyrites. The microscopic slide shows these to be aggregates\r\nof little cubes, while the bulk of the rock is a schistose felsitic\r\nmass of quartz and felspar, with scattered larger felspar crystals,\r\nmuch broken up and bent. In this rock too we have therefore a rolled\r\nup and altered felsite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Mica-schists.=\r\n\r\n\r\nMica-schists, composed mainly of golden-brown lustrous laminæ\r\nof biotite with more or less quartz, occur near the base of Gebel\r\nZabara and at Gebel Sikait [10,626], as well as in small quantity\r\nat one or two other points. They are always associated with gneiss,\r\nand appear to form irregular bands, alternating and mixed with talc\r\nand other schists. The laminæ of mica can seldom be separated in\r\nany large size, breaking up at a touch into small scales; they are\r\noften highly contorted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.—Beryl and quartz, from a lenticle in\r\nmica-schist near Sikait [10,580], × 30. _b_, beryl in idiomorphic\r\nhexagonal crystals; _q_, quartz, allotriomorphic.]\r\n\r\n=Emeralds= (Beryl).—At Zabara and Sikait the mica-schists\r\ncontain crystals of beryl (silicate of beryllium and aluminium,\r\nBe3Al2Si6O18), the clear variety of which forms the gem emerald. The\r\nberyls are mostly found in lenticular bands of quartz which occur\r\nin the mica-schist, but sometimes they can be seen in the schist\r\nitself. The crystals are mostly well developed hexagonal prisms of a\r\npale emerald-green colour, with characteristic vertical striation. The\r\ncoloured figure on Plate XXV will give a good idea of the usual\r\nappearance of the mineral. In microscopic slides (_see_ Fig. 58) the\r\nberyls are conspicuous only by their clear cut hexagonal outlines;\r\nthey are quite colourless, with low polarisation colours about\r\nthe same as those of quartz. Both at Zabara and Sikait there are\r\nnumerous ruins and ancient mines where emeralds have been sought;\r\nmost of them are irregular shafts and tunnels, twisting about as\r\nthe old miners followed the varying directions of the bands of\r\nschists. It is commonly believed that gem emeralds were at one time\r\nextracted from these mines, and it seems incredible that the mining\r\nshould have been carried on to so great an extent as is shown by\r\nthe ruins and old workings, unless stones of considerable value were\r\nobtained. The Zabara mines were re-opened by Cailliaud in the time of\r\nMohammad Ali Pasha (1817), but the stones extracted were of little\r\nvalue, being clouded and full of flaws. A similar result followed\r\na more recent (1904-5) vigorous attempt by Mr. James, acting on\r\nbehalf of Mr. Edwin Streeter, of London, to work the emerald mines\r\nof Sikait; plenty of beryls were found, but none clear enough to\r\nbe of any great value, and the enterprise was abandoned, Mr. James\r\nconcluding that either the ancient miners had worked out all the\r\nbands containing stones of any value, or else, what is perhaps more\r\nlikely, the ancients were satisfied with a duller stone for a gem\r\nthan our modern jewellers. The dull forms of beryl are in our own\r\nday of very little value, being principally used as a source for\r\nberyllium salts in chemical laboratories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.—Tourmaline crystals in graphitic\r\ntalc-schist, Sikait mines [9,908], × 17. _t_, tourmaline crystals,\r\nirregularly cracked and clouded; _g_, talc-schist, heavily clouded\r\nby graphite.]\r\n\r\n=Tourmaline.=—Besides beryls, the mica and talc schists of Sikait\r\ncontain in places abundance of black tourmaline in well-developed\r\ncrystals. At some spots this mineral is so plentiful as to form\r\npractically small patches of tourmaline-rock [10,395]. In thin section\r\n[9,874 and 9,908] the tourmaline crystals, which are much clouded\r\nand irregularly cracked, show beautiful pleochroism (colourless to\r\ndeep orange), and very high double refraction colours in prismatic\r\nsections. Like the beryl, however, tourmaline is only of value as\r\na gem when it is clear and transparent, and all the crystals so far\r\nobtained are dull and opaque.\r\n\r\nCalcite, in rhomb-shaped crystals of a brown colour due to presence\r\nof included iron oxides [10,382] likewise occurs in places in the\r\nmica-schists of Sikait.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Chlorite-schists.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThough many of the decomposed hornblende-schists contain more or\r\nless chlorite, I have only in two localities come across rocks\r\n_in situ_ which contain so large a proportion of this mineral as\r\nto deserve the name of chlorite-schists. The first is in the hills\r\nof Um el Huetat (latitude 25°), where typical chlorite-schists are\r\nmixed with mica, talc, and hornblende schists. The second locality\r\nis between Gebels Ras Shait and Nugrus, where the rock [10,388]\r\nis remarkable not only in its peculiar appearance but also by its\r\nstrongly magnetic character. It is a thoroughly schistose rock of\r\na rather pale greyish-green colour and rather silky appearance,\r\nwith rusty looking spots. The sp. gr. is 2·77. The microscopic\r\nslide shows the stone to consist essentially of an aggregate of\r\nelongated plates and fibres of low double refraction, which from the\r\nhand specimen seem to be chlorite, but in the slide look more like\r\nantigorite. Magnetite grains are liberally scattered through the\r\nchloritic mass. The rusty spots visible in the hand specimen are\r\ntranslucent foxy red in the slide, in irregular broken forms with\r\nwell-marked cleavage and nearly straight extinction. They are somewhat\r\ndoubtfully regarded as deeply iron-stained hornblende. Mixed with the\r\nfoxy red material are aggregates of granules of a highly refracting\r\nbut isotropic mineral of deep bottle-green colour (? spinel),\r\nand chloritic wisps. There are also some clear colourless grains,\r\nresembling apatite in appearance except that they sometimes show\r\nwell-marked vertical cleavage and high extinction angles; these are\r\npossibly a colourless augite, but the double-refraction colours are\r\nfar lower than is usual with this mineral.\r\n\r\nTypical chlorite-schists occur in the Wadi Salib Abiad, and near\r\nGebels Ribdab and Muqsim, in the extreme south-west portion of the\r\nregion. Hearing, from some wandering Arabs while at Gebel Abu Dahr in\r\nFebruary 1907, that prospectors were at work in the Wadi Salib Abiad,\r\nI sent a guide to find out who they were and what they were doing;\r\nthe guide reported that on his arrival they had gone away, but there\r\nwere some old workings in a green rock of which he brought a sample. I\r\ndid not get an opportunity of visiting the locality personally,\r\nbut the specimen brought back by the guide [11,523] is a beautiful\r\napple-green chlorite-schist, with some brownish calcareous-looking\r\nbands. The microscopic slide shows some little quartz and talc besides\r\nthe chlorite, and there are scattered minute highly-refracting rounded\r\ngrains of a feebly translucent mineral of a reddish-brown colour,\r\nprobably rutile. A similar rock from the eastern side of Gebel Muqsim\r\nhas been reported by Mr. Charteris Stewart, who also records a normal\r\nchlorite-schist as occurring on the north side of Gebel Ribdab.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Talc-schists.=\r\n\r\n\r\nTalc-schists, though not widely distributed, are abundant in certain\r\nlocalities. They form the main rock in many of the hills in the\r\ndistrict called Um el Huetat, to the west of Gebel Atut in latitude\r\n25°, where there are numerous old mines. In this district there are\r\nimmense masses of talc-schist of remarkable purity. The rock [10,364]\r\nis of a grey to green or brown colour, distinctly schistose, cleaving\r\neasily with a soapy feel, and easily scratched by the finger nail;\r\nmore massive forms occur which can be easily carved into pipes, and\r\nthese are frequently smoked by the Bedouin. I descended one of the old\r\nshafts at Um el Huetat, and found no evidence of other minerals having\r\nbeen worked than the talc itself. A somewhat more earthy variety of\r\ntalc-schist [10,396] was met with near the Rod el Ligaia. Talc-schists\r\nalso occur at Gebel Sikait [10,383] and Gebel Zabara, where, as at\r\nUm el Huetat, they alternate with mica and hornblende schists. But\r\nat Sikait and Zabara the talc-schists are decidedly subordinate to\r\nthe mica-schist in which the beryls are found.\r\n\r\nTo the class of talc-schists is also probably best referred a fissile\r\nand very rotten purple-brown schist, containing cubes of limonite,\r\nwhich was found near the triangulation station on Gebel Hamida,\r\nand again near the old mines of Romit. The microscopic slide of\r\nthe Romit specimen [12,139] shows the bulk of the rock to consist\r\nof talc and chlorite, with blotchy stains and floculent-looking\r\nmasses of brown iron oxide and occasional clear irregular granules\r\nof quartz. In this are plentifully embedded perfect little cubes of\r\nlimonite. The limonite cubes [12,129 and 12,136] weather out easily\r\nfrom the rotten matrix, and can be gathered from the ground at the\r\nfoot of the exposed surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   =Calcareous Schists and Marble.=\r\n\r\n\r\nSome very curious calcareous schists are found in Gebel el Anbat and\r\nits neighbourhood, near the Wadi Hodein. In Gebel el Anbat itself a\r\nmass of these rocks rises to a height of over 250 metres above the\r\nwadi level. They are earthy-looking rocks of varying colour, chiefly\r\nbrown and reddish, often purplish on the rough weathered surfaces,\r\nand sometimes have a talcose feel. A typical specimen [11,532 A]\r\nhas a sp. gr. of 2·92, and the slide cut from it shows it to be\r\nalmost entirely composed of grains of calcite, with here and there\r\nlarger irregular granules of quartz and of what looks like altered\r\nfelspar, and a liberal sprinkling of iron oxide. It is difficult to\r\nassign an origin to this rock, but a variation of it [11,532 B] has\r\nbeen already described (p. 339) as probably an altered syenite, and\r\nthe main rock may therefore represent the extreme form of alteration\r\nof an igneous rock rich in lime felspars.\r\n\r\nA hard close-grained reddish-brown rock of sp. gr. 2·91, with dark\r\nstreaks [12,107], which forms a high ridge, swathed in blown sand,\r\nrising to 350 metres above sea-level near the Wadi Kreiga, eleven\r\nand a half kilometres to the south-east of Gebel Beida, resembles a\r\nquartzite in appearance, but turns out on careful examination to be a\r\ncalcareous schist. The microscopic section shows a very fine-grained\r\nmosaic of calcite with a little quartz, and scattered grains and\r\nstrings of iron oxide. The origin of this rock is uncertain; it may\r\nbe a metamorphosed limestone.\r\n\r\nThe summit of a high hill rising to 686 metres above sea, on the\r\neast side of the Wadi Um Khariga in latitude 24° 56′ 30″, is\r\na gozzany mass resembling the outcrop of a mineral vein traversing\r\nthe schists. On a fresh fracture, the interior of the rock [10,369]\r\nis seen to consist mainly of dark crystalline calcite, with some\r\ncubical crystals of pyrites, numerous rusty looking spots and patches\r\nof limonite, and veinlets of white calcite. The microscopic slide\r\nshows a mixture of calcite with kaolinic and serpentinous matter,\r\nwith a very pronounced schistose structure, containing “eyes”\r\nof mixed calcite and iron oxides; the rock is therefore in reality a\r\nferruginous calcareous schist. The mass is too highly metamorphosed\r\nfor more than a guess as to its origin; but the slide contains some\r\ngranules resembling picotite and one or two small patches of what\r\nlooks like altering felspar, and the suggestion is that the schist\r\nis a metamorphosed basic igneous vein.\r\n\r\n=White crystalline marble= has been found only at one point, namely,\r\nabout three kilometres south of the jagged peak called Qash Amir,\r\nwest of Gebel Elba, where it forms a small patch in crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Graphite-schists.=\r\n\r\n\r\nA considerable mass of graphite-schist occurs associated with diorite\r\nrocks near some ancient gold workings at Gebel Allawi. The extent of\r\nthe graphite-schist has not been mapped, but it occurs on the north\r\nslope of the mountain, and as seen from the summit it appears to run\r\nout westward for miles as a broad black band. The rock [10,378],\r\nwhich has a sp. gr. of 2·70, consists of a mixture of graphite\r\nwith calcareous and earthy matter. The parts richest in graphite are\r\nreadily cut with a knife, and mark paper easily. Analysis shows that\r\nthe graphite, though sufficiently abundant to appear in the hand\r\nspecimen the dominant mineral of the rock, is nevertheless present\r\nin surprisingly small proportion; a sample tested by Mr. Pollard\r\nwas found to contain only a trifle over one per cent. of carbon.\r\n\r\nA similar graphite-schist occurs associated with mica-schist in\r\none of the emerald mines of Gebel Sikait, and it may be remarked\r\nthat graphitic schists have also been observed by Dr. Hume near\r\nthe lodes in the gold mines of Baramia and Um Garaiart, both of\r\nwhich localities, however, lie outside the limits of the area here\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the graphite-schists is uncertain. Perhaps the\r\nhypothesis presenting the least difficulty is that which supposes\r\nthem to have been formed from ancient sedimentary rocks containing\r\nthe remains of plants; on this view the close association of dioritic\r\nrocks suggests that the great of igneous intrusion may have played a\r\npart in the distillation of the more volatile matters of the plant\r\nremains, while the schistose structure shows that pressure has\r\nalso been active in the formation of the rock. But the absence of\r\nany associated rocks which bear distinct signs of having originally\r\nbeen ancient sediments makes one hesitate to refer the graphite to\r\nan organic origin, and possibly the carbonaceous matter may have\r\nbeen produced from quite another source than that of plant life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Breccias.=\r\n\r\n\r\nA very curious rock [10,385] which from a distance looks like a giant\r\ndiorite, occurs as a band in gneiss on the west side of the lower\r\npart of Wadi Nugrus, is doubtless a fluidal breccia. It contains\r\novoid masses of white aplite, sometimes measuring five centimetres\r\nin diameter, embedded in a dark fine-grained dioritic matrix with\r\na marked tendency to schistose structure. Most likely the rock has\r\nbeen formed by the catching up of the fragments of a crushed aplite\r\nin an intrusive diorite, and then the whole mass has been subjected\r\nto the same pressure which foliated the surrounding gneisses.\r\n\r\nMore normal breccias are found at various points. One which occurs\r\nbetween schists and hornfels near the summit of Gebel Abu Hamamid\r\n[10,398] is made up of fragments of various altered volcanic rocks,\r\nwith large black flint-like lumps of hornfels, all cemented into a\r\nvery hard rock which breaks across the fragments composing it. This\r\nbreccia was doubtless formed by the same movements which produced the\r\nschists of the summit of the mountain; these latter (_see_ p. 341)\r\nare themselves almost as much fine breccias as schists.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Gebel Zergat Naam the stones in the wadis are sometimes\r\ncemented into hard breccias by calcareous matter, doubtless deposited\r\nby drainage waters which have dissolved out the lime from felspathic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nIn the hill called Ti Keferiai, a little below the triangulation\r\npoint which marks the summit, a highly altered fine-grained dioritic\r\nrock, containing much epidote, has been crushed into a coarse breccia\r\n[12,123] cemented by rose-coloured quartz.\r\n\r\nA remarkable green breccia is found in Gebel Hamata, where it appears\r\nto form a large mass in the mountain-side to the east of the main\r\npeak. This rock [10,407], which has a sp. gr. of 2·92, is darker\r\nin colour and somewhat softer than the ornamental “breccia verde\r\nantico” of the Wadi Hammamat district further north,[135] but it\r\nalso is a very beautiful rock. In the hand specimen, it consists of\r\nblack angular fragments, up to two centimetres in diameter, embedded\r\nin a dark green ground mass, the whole of very fine grain and barely\r\nscratchable with a knife. Under the microscope, the black fragments\r\nseem to be of basaltic nature, while the green matrix is probably a\r\nhighly crushed and brecciated diorite-porphyrite; the whole of the\r\nslide is clouded by decomposition products.\r\n\r\n=Fault-breccias=, produced by differential movement of the two sides\r\nof faults, occur in the neighbourhood of the Wadi Saalek, where the\r\nsandstones and schists are much faulted (_see_ p. 359). The breccias\r\nhere [11,539] are narrow bands which stand up like dykes; they are\r\nvery calcareous and highly ferruginous, with occasional green stains,\r\nperhaps due to traces of copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Mineral Veins.=\r\n\r\n\r\nQuartz veins deposited by solutions[136] in cracks and fissures\r\nof the igneous and metamorphic rocks are very numerous and widely\r\ndistributed, especially in the Sukari district. They vary immensely in\r\nsize, from mere strings to veins two metres or more in thickness; they\r\ncut the rocks in every direction and at every angle of dip. Steeply\r\ninclined veins are by far the most numerous, but some have a flat\r\ninclination and are then styled “reefs” by the miners.\r\n\r\nThe principal interest attaching to the quartz veins is the fact that\r\nthey frequently contain gold, though seldom in particles visible\r\nto the unaided eye. The quartz veins were worked for their gold by\r\nthe ancients, the remains of whose dwellings and stone grinding pans\r\nare found at numerous places, as for instance in the Wadi Hangalia,\r\nat Kurdeman, near Gebel Sabahia, at Gebels Sukari and Allawi, in\r\nthe Wadi Lewewi, and at Romit and Darahib. Our modern prospectors\r\nhave found these ruins of ancient mining camps and grinding pans\r\nto be the best guide to auriferous veins, gold being seldom found\r\nexcept in and near the old workings. As mentioned on p. 27, the\r\nancients worked the mines by convict labour, and they could for\r\nthat reason afford to work ores which are too poor to pay under\r\nmodern conditions. But in certain cases the veins have been found\r\nrich enough to give possibilities of a commercial return to modern\r\nmining enterprise; a list of the prospecting licences and mining\r\nleases now in force is given on p. 28. As to the source of the gold,\r\nit is not known whether it came up in solutions from below, or has\r\nbeen secreted laterally from the country rock.\r\n\r\nBesides gold, some of the quartz veins contain traces of copper,\r\nbut none of the occurrences of copper ore within the area specially\r\ntreated of in this book appear to be capable of yielding any\r\nconsiderable quantity of the metal, most of them in fact being\r\nmere stains due to oxidation and carbonatisation of traces of\r\nsulphides.[137]\r\n\r\nCalcite veins are much more rarely met with than those of quartz. In\r\nonly one of the veins I have examined is calcite present in any\r\nconsiderable quantity, namely in the vein of the old gold mines of\r\nRomit. In this vein, white to brown crystalline calcite is found\r\nmixed with chalybite, limonite, and smoky quartz [12,105 and 12,141],\r\nthe last-named only being apparently auriferous. There did not\r\nappear to be enough chalybite and limonite in the vein to make it\r\nworth following up for iron ore, especially in view of the expense\r\nof transport from the place.\r\n\r\nMagnesite and asbestos veins occur in the serpentines of the Gebel\r\nGerf district. These occurrences, which appear not to be large enough\r\nto be worth working, have been described on p. 330.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: The figures in square brackets in this and the\r\npreceding chapter are the numbers under which the specimens are\r\nregistered in the Geological Museum, Cairo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: _See_ Barron and Hume’s “Eastern Desert.” Cairo,\r\n1902. p. 263.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Other quartz veins which probably originated in quite\r\na different manner are treated of under the heading of Igneous Rocks\r\n_see_ (p. 266).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: The copper smelted in ancient times at Kubban, on\r\nthe east bank of the Nile opposite Dakka, in latitude 23° 10′,\r\nwas possibly obtained from mines at Abu Seyal (sometimes misspelt\r\nAbsciel), north of the Wadi Alaqi in latitude 22° 47′, longitude\r\n33° 44′, where there are extensive old workings, Abu Seyal lies\r\noutside the region described in this volume; a reference to the\r\nmines will be found in the _Report of the Egyptian Department of\r\nMines for 1906_, p. 34.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n                   =TECTONICS AND GENERAL GEOLOGY.=\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n                =Evidence of a former Pluvial Period.=\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven a sufficiently long period for their activity, the denuding\r\nand transporting agencies at work at the present day are capable of\r\naccounting for most of the superficial sculpturing of South-Eastern\r\nEgypt. The country is not absolutely rainless, and within a decade\r\nmost of the dry valleys have been for a few hours the beds of\r\nstreams, the result of rain storms. There is practically no frost\r\nin this part of the world, so that disintegration by the freezing\r\nof water in crevices of the rock does not occur on any large scale;\r\nthe diurnal variations of temperature, are, however, so great that\r\nthis cause alone is very potent in breaking up rock material. The\r\ndisintegrated matter accumulates as heaps of debris and sand, ready\r\nto be transported towards the Nile or the sea by the streams which\r\nfollow the next rainfall. Both in erosion and in the transport of\r\nsand, wind is a very active agent, and accounts for the formation and\r\ndistribution of immense quantities of sand. Thus the mountains are\r\nslowly being lowered, and the rocky valleys between them are being\r\nwidened and deepened, even at the present day, and the accumulations\r\nof sand on the coast-plain and elsewhere are being slowly increased\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\nBut when we look at the great wadis, often hundreds of kilometres\r\nin length, cut to a depth of fifty metres with a width of half a\r\nkilometre through the sandstone plateaux which separate the mountain\r\nranges from the Nile, it is difficult to conceive that rainfall and\r\ndenudation have not in the past been greater than at present. In\r\nour own day, it is but seldom that the great wadis convey streams\r\nas far as the Nile or the sea, their waters being usually absorbed\r\nby the sandy bed before the end is reached; erosion nowadays is\r\npractically confined to the upper reaches of the wadis, and unless we\r\npostulate greater rainfall in the past, inconceivable ages must have\r\nbeen occupied in the erosion of these great channels. We are thus\r\ndriven to believe that what is now a very dry area was formerly one\r\nof considerable rainfall. This belief is supported by the traces of\r\nglaciation in Europe, for it is natural to infer that when temperate\r\nEurope had an arctic climate, northern Africa had a temperate one;\r\nthe effect, whatever its cause, being practically equivalent to an\r\nincrease of latitude. This change of climate is equally evidenced by\r\ngeological observation in other parts of Egypt. It is even likely\r\nthat the climate of Egypt may be slowly changing at present; but\r\nthe change within the historical period has been so small as to be\r\npractically negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =Origin of the Red Sea.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the 200-metre contour of the bottom of the Red Sea, shown on Plate\r\nI, be examined, it will be found to exhibit great indentations\r\ntowards the great mountain masses, while there is a curious\r\nprojection including the Island of Zeberged which mimics the present\r\nRas Benas. Some of the indentations of the contour line lie in the\r\ndirect prolongation of existing great wadis, such as those of Lahami,\r\nKhoda, Hodein, Di-ib, and Serimtai. The obvious suggestion from this\r\ncoincidence is that the sea has encroached on the land since the\r\ndrainage-system had substantially its present form, and we infer a\r\nsinking of the region at no very remote geological epoch. The central\r\nparts of the Red Sea attain depths of over 2,000 metres; thus this sea\r\nwas a great and deep one even when the level of its waters, relative\r\nto the land, was 200 metres lower than now. We have no information\r\nwhich would give us a clue to the origin of this primitive sea, but\r\nthe inference from the contours is that the _present_ extent of the\r\nRed Sea has been caused by a great general subsidence of the land,\r\nand not by trough-faulting as has hitherto been usually stated.[138]\r\n\r\nThe subsidence just referred to was even greater than would be\r\ngathered from a consideration of the present coast-line. At intervals\r\nalong the entire eastern coast of Egypt are hills of gypsum;\r\nthese are never found except close to the present sea-borders,\r\nand the natural deduction is that the gypsum beds were deposited\r\nwhen the sea was at a higher level than at present. At Ras Benas,\r\nthe gypseous strata reach altitudes of nearly 200 metres, so that at\r\nthe time when the gypsum was formed the Red Sea must have covered a\r\nmuch greater area than now, extending in fact approximately to the\r\ncontour of 200 metres above present sea-level. As to the epoch when\r\nthis greater extent of the sea existed, we should have a clue if we\r\nknew the age of the gypsum beds, which unfortunately is not the case;\r\nbut they are almost certainly younger Tertiary beds, possibly Miocene\r\nor even Pliocene, so that in any case the Red Sea is a depression\r\nof considerable antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n             =Possible Former Extent of the Eocene Rocks.=\r\n\r\n\r\nEocene rocks are entirely absent from the district, and the same is\r\nthe case with Cretaceous rocks younger than the Nubian sandstone. But\r\nif we go westward along the parallel of Berenice, across the Nile\r\ninto longitude 23° 30′, we come to the plateau face of Gebel Garra,\r\nwhere there are exposed thicknesses of about ninety metres of Eocene\r\nlimestone and 240 metres of Cretaceous marls. These beds cover great\r\nexpanses further west and north; they evidently once extended beyond\r\ntheir present limits, and we may ask whether they ever reached over\r\nthe Red Sea mountains here, as is the case in North-Eastern Egypt. To\r\nthis question no answer can be given; from Berenice to Gebel Garra is\r\na distance of over 300 kilometres, and even a very gradual thinning\r\nof the beds eastward would account for their absence from the main\r\nmountains; at the same time the denudation which has removed every\r\ntrace of the hard Eocene limestone from the plain between Gebel\r\nGarra and the Nile may well have done the same further east.\r\n\r\n\r\n              =Original Extent of the Nubian Sandstone.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nubian sandstone is found on both sides of the watershed ranges,\r\nand the question raised by its distribution is in regard to its\r\npossible original continuity. Did the Nubian sandstone once extend\r\nover the present igneous mountains, or was it laid down on either side\r\nof a great island ridge? In other words, did the Red Sea mountains\r\nexist as such in Cretaceous times, or have they been subsequently\r\nelevated, and the Nubian sandstones which covered them denuded\r\naway? To this question it may be stated at once that no certain\r\nanswer can be given; but a good deal of study has been devoted to\r\nthe facts bearing upon it, and these facts will be briefly enumerated\r\nand discussed below.\r\n\r\n_Evidence from Volcanic Intrusions._—That the Nubian sandstone\r\nis younger than the igneous rocks in general is proved by the\r\nalmost complete absence of intrusions into the sandstone. Apart\r\nfrom an interbedded diabase sheet in the north part of the region\r\nand a small basic dyke near Gebel Awamtib, the igneous rocks appear\r\nnowhere to penetrate the Nubian beds. The sandstone is _a fortiori_\r\nyounger than the metamorphic rocks into which the igneous masses\r\nhave been intruded.\r\n\r\n_Evidence from Present Distribution._—Coming now to the distribution\r\nof the sandstone, though we find it on both sides of the main ranges,\r\nthere is not a trace of sandstone among the higher mountains; this\r\nof course proves nothing, for denudation would be most active among\r\nthe peaks and in districts of maximum up-thrust, and sandstone\r\nis an easily erodible rock. The long tongue of sandstone plateau\r\nwhich terminates in Gebel Anfeib extends indeed right across the\r\nmain watershed, but a reference to the orographical map (Plate I)\r\nwill show that this extension is along a north-west to south-east\r\ngeneral depression, where the Wadis Hodein and Garara form a cut\r\nacross the map separating the main mountain masses into north and\r\nsouth groups. The presence of the sandstone tongue here would be\r\nequally well accounted for whether the mountains were elevated before\r\nor after the deposition of the Nubian beds.\r\n\r\nNot only is the sandstone absent from the main mountains, but\r\nit is never found in such close proximity to them as to render\r\na decisive answer to our question. Thus the eastern scarp of the\r\nsandstone plateau in the north part of the area overlooks a broad\r\ntract of low country between it and the mountains; and similarly\r\nfrom Gebel Anfeib one overlooks low country to the north, east, and\r\nsouth. On the eastern side of the mountains the sandstone deposits\r\nare restricted to small patches considerably removed from the main\r\nsummits, and even in most cases from their foot-hills.\r\n\r\n_Evidences from Structural Features._—With regard to the structural\r\nevidences to be gathered from the sandstone itself, it was hoped\r\nthat the observations of the dip of the beds at different places\r\nwould throw light on the question as to whether their deposition\r\nantedated the mountain formation or no.\r\n\r\nTo the north of latitude 24°, the eastern edge of the sandstone\r\nscarp showed beds differing but little from the horizontal, though\r\nvery gentle folding in various directions is probable.\r\n\r\nFurther south, near Gebel Zergat Naam, much more decided evidences\r\nof folding, and even of dislocation, were met with. The head of the\r\nWadi el Kreim, south-west of Zergat Naam (_see_ the geological map on\r\nPlate XX) is probably a line of fault, for here on the south-west of\r\nthe wadi we have sandstones coming right down to the wadi floor, with\r\na dip of 30° to the south-west near the edge, becoming flatter the\r\nfurther we go from the wadi, while on the other side are crushed and\r\nbrecciated schists. Going further west, in the sandstone hill-mass\r\nwhich lies twelve kilometres west of Zergat Naam, the dip of the\r\nbeds is in the opposite direction, being 10° to 15° north-east,\r\nand granite appears at the foot of the steep west-south-west slope;\r\nthis, with the preceding observation, seems to indicate a synclinal\r\nfold terminated near Zergat Naam by a fault up-thrusting the schists\r\nand syenite.\r\n\r\nWhere the Wadi Garara cuts through the sandstone hills to receive\r\nthe Wadi el Kreim, the beds dip markedly to the south, the observed\r\ninclinations being 60° or more at the north edges, rapidly falling\r\nto 20° or less further south; the north faces show granite and\r\nschists at their base.\r\n\r\nFurther west, on the way to Gebel Um Harba, the sandstone of the\r\nhills showed dips to the east of 15°. At Gebel Um Harba itself there\r\nare thick beds of sandstone dipping 13° east-north-east, while all\r\naround the mountain one looks out over beds having approximately\r\nthe same inclination.\r\n\r\nAt Gebel Um Khafur, the dip is 13° to 14° to the north-north-east,\r\nand is very constant over a large area. From the north side,\r\nwhere the plain is 380 metres above sea-level, the hills rise\r\nwith a succession of dip slopes and basset-edges over a horizontal\r\ndistance of 2·9 kilometres (measured perpendicular to the strike)\r\nto the triangulation beacon at 560 metres above sea, the beds all\r\nalong dipping at 13° or 14°. Unless there is step-faulting here\r\nalong the strike-wadis (_see_ Fig. 60) the total thickness of Nubian\r\nsandstone here is over 450 metres. This is a much greater thickness\r\nthan has been noted anywhere else in Egypt, and I am inclined to\r\nthink that there is step-faulting along at least two of the strike\r\nwadis which separate the hill-mass into ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.—Section of Sandstone at Gebel Um Khafur.]\r\n\r\nIn approaching Gebel Awamtib from the north-west, I crossed over a\r\nsmall patch of diorite in the sandstone at the pass from Wadi Um\r\nTerbi into Wadi Awamtib, and a basic dyke was found cutting the\r\nsandstone of a spur of Gebel Awamtib. The beds of Awamtib itself\r\ndip pretty uniformly a little north of west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.—Sketch section of junction of sandstone\r\nwith granite, west of Gebel Um Keit.]\r\n\r\nAbout nine kilometres to the south of Gebel Awamtib, a station was\r\ntaken on a sandstone headland with schists and quartz veins at its\r\nfloor, and afterwards I skirted the limit between sandstone and\r\ngranitic rocks on the way to Gebel Um Reit. All along this route\r\nthere was no suggestion of sharp folding or faulting; the beds were\r\nnearly horizontal right up to the limit, where the granite hills\r\nrise suddenly (_see_ Fig. 61).\r\n\r\nFrom the top of Gebel Um Reit, which itself is granite, the sandstone\r\nlimit could be seen to the north and east; the beds dip 30° in\r\nplaces; in those on the east the direction of dip is about south. The\r\nregion round Um Reit is evidently one of considerable disturbance,\r\nbut the sandstone is too far off for one to get any precise idea of\r\nits nature from the summit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.—Sketch of faulting near Wadi Saalek.]\r\n\r\nGoing northwards from Um Reit across the Wadi Saalek and up one\r\nof its branches into the head of Wadi Muegil, there is a good\r\nexposure of faulted sandstone overlying schists just before reaching\r\nthe pass. Here (_see_ Fig. 62) one of the faults is a distinct\r\noverthrust, with a north-easterly strike, and there are other faults\r\nin a parallel direction.\r\n\r\nFrom the Wadi Muegil northwards past the Galt el Aguz to Gebel Um\r\nHarba there are gentle dips and curvings of the sandstone beds,\r\nwith a predominant dip about north-east. At the Galt el Aguz the\r\nsandstone rocks are much tumbled about, but this appears to be due\r\nto fall of over-hanging beds.\r\n\r\nAt the pass from Wadi Um Arta into the head of Wadi Silsila,\r\nthe dip of the sandstone is north-north-east. In its lower part,\r\nWadi Silsila passes between sandstone ridges the dip of which is\r\nconstantly east-north-east.\r\n\r\nRound Bir Abraq and the triangulation station on Gebel Abraq\r\n(_see_ large scale map on Plate XV) the main direction of dip is\r\neast-south-east; the pool of Bir Abraq itself is under projecting\r\nslabs of sandstone dipping in this direction. Bir el Sunta, a little\r\nfurther north, appears to lie in a syncline, the beds of the hills to\r\nthe north dipping south-east, while those to the south dip north-west.\r\n\r\nApproaching the sandstone from the east by Wadi Hodein, one traverses\r\ngranite country with felsite dykes and enters suddenly into high\r\nsandstone plateaux. The beds at the Abu Saafa Springs dip about\r\n5° northwards.\r\n\r\nThe beds of Gebel Dif and Gebel Anfeib have a prevalent dip on the\r\nwest side to the east and north-east, while on the east face the dip\r\nappears to be in the reverse direction. This great mass of sandstone\r\nplateau may thus be a syncline with a north-westerly strike (_i.e._,\r\na strike roughly parallel to the main direction of the watershed\r\nmountain ranges), but the eastern face was not examined in detail,\r\nand it may be that the whole mass dips to the north-east; some\r\noutlying small sandstone masses near the head of Wadi Edunqul show\r\nno reversal, the dip being still east-north-east. At Bir Dif the\r\nsandstones are variously tilted, and probably faulted.\r\n\r\nThe sandstones on the east side of the watershed ranges, near Gebel\r\nRanga, were observed by Dr. Hume to dip towards the sea. In the south\r\npart of the region there are some low hills forming two series of\r\nridges between the sea and Gebel Kolaiqo, separated by hills of red\r\naplitic granite; these hills were not actually visited, but were\r\nmapped from some little distance, and the dip of the beds was not\r\nmeasured, but the nature of the rocks was confirmed by specimens of\r\nsandstone brought back by guides sent to the place.\r\n\r\nSumming up the dips and disturbances of the sandstone beds at the\r\ndifferent places, it is clear that the strata are the more disturbed,\r\nthe more closely they approach the main mountain ranges; this and\r\nthe seaward dip of the beds near El Ranga are so far in favour of\r\nthe view that the sandstone may once have extended right over the\r\npresent mountains. But it will be seen that the disturbances of\r\nbedding are of an irregular character, especially between Gebels\r\nZergat Naam and Um Reit, where the folding and faulting are often\r\nin directions quite distinct from that of the main mountain axes,\r\nand it may be that these disturbances are due to later movements\r\nrather than to the elevation of the main mountain ranges. So far as\r\nobservations on the sandstone itself go, therefore, the question as\r\nto whether the Nubian sandstones of the Red Sea border ever directly\r\njoined those on the west of the mountains remains open; the observed\r\ndisturbances of the beds give us clear proof that considerable earth\r\nmovements have taken place since the sandstone was deposited, but\r\nthey are inconclusive as to whether these same movements caused the\r\nelevation of the great mountain ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 =The Igneous and Metamorphic Rocks.=\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning now to the main mountain-forming rocks, we find them composed\r\nof the two great classes, igneous and metamorphic. Though in places\r\nwe have transition members, such as granites passing into gneiss, yet\r\non the whole the two groups are quite distinct, and we find typical\r\nigneous masses rising in the midst of equally typical schists. Under\r\nthese circumstances there can be no hesitation in considering the\r\ntwo groups to be of different ages, and that the igneous rocks must\r\nbe the younger.\r\n\r\nThe igneous masses are divisible geologically into the three classes\r\nof (_a_) lavas, (_b_) dykes, and (_c_) plutonic rocks.\r\n\r\n_Lavas._—Amongst the igneous rocks, the lavas are those most\r\npoorly represented. Apart from the andesite of Gebel Sufra, and the\r\ndiabase sheets in or under the Nubian sandstone, there are only a\r\nfew occurrences of volcanic rocks in all the area, a circumstance\r\nwhich is easily explained by the enormous denudation which has\r\ngone on and the fact that lavas, being superficial out-pourings,\r\nwill have been most exposed to denuding forces.\r\n\r\n_Dykes._—Dykes seam the schists and igneous rocks, frequently in\r\nsuch numbers and with such parallelism as to give to the land the\r\nform of a succession of ridges separated by long narrow depressions,\r\nforming “dyke country.” In nature, the dykes vary from extremely\r\nacid rocks like aplites and quartz-felsites, to very basic forms\r\nsuch as diabase and basalt. There is on the whole a preponderance\r\nof basic over acid types. As already remarked, only one instance\r\nof a dyke cutting the Nubian sandstone has been observed in the\r\ndistrict. Another significant feature in the distribution of dykes\r\nis that while dykes of all kinds are found cutting schists and acid\r\nplutonic igneous rocks, the basic plutonic masses are as a rule free\r\nfrom dykes; this suggests that the basic plutonic rocks may be on\r\nthe whole younger than the acid forms.\r\n\r\n_Plutonic Rocks._—The plutonic rocks include granites, syenites,\r\ndiorites, gabbros, pyroxenites, amphibolites, and peridotites. But\r\nthese are not all of equal importance, and a natural division from the\r\nfield observations is a two-fold one into acid and basic groups, which\r\nare tolerably well marked off from each other and are most likely of\r\ndifferent ages. The acid class on this view consists of the granites\r\nand syenites, while the basic class contains all the other rocks\r\nabove-mentioned. The granites are on the whole of a very acid type;\r\nsyenite is very scarce and nearly always occurs in close association\r\nwith granite. Of the basic group, probably the most abundant and\r\nmost typical rock is gabbro; diorites and the various ultra-basic\r\nrocks are almost always closely associated with gabbro. Where acid\r\nand basic rocks occur in proximity (as for instance near Bir Abraq,\r\nwhere an acid granite occurs side by side with a serpentine) there\r\nis a sharp change, without transitional forms.\r\n\r\nThe much greater abundance of dykes in the plutonic rocks of the acid\r\ngroup as compared with those of basic composition, as mentioned above,\r\ninclines us to regard the basic group as the younger—a view which\r\nis further supported by the greater frequency with which a tendency\r\nto gneissose structure is noticeable in the acid rocks. The fact that\r\nthe basic members are frequently in a higher state of decomposition\r\nthan the acid ones is not contrary to this view, being due to the\r\ngreater ease with which their constituents undergo weathering; and\r\nas explained on p. 315, the fissured state of the altered peridotes\r\nis probably not due to the same earth forces which have sheared the\r\ngranites, but to internal stresses set up by the expansion of the\r\nrocks on serpentinisation.\r\n\r\nThough we may be fairly sure that the basic plutonic rocks are\r\non the whole younger than the acid ones, we have no certain guide\r\nfrom which to estimate the geological age of either. We know from\r\ntheir relations to the sandstone that they are both older than the\r\nUpper Cretaceous, but we cannot say how much older; they may be\r\nanything from Archæan to Jurassic; the circumstance that similar\r\nrocks underlie Carboniferous strata in Sinai inclines us to place\r\nthem at least as far back as Palæozoic times.\r\n\r\n_Gneisses and Schists._—The gneisses and schists which cover so much\r\nof the country are obviously older than the plutonic masses which\r\nare intruded in them, and for these metamorphic masses we need have\r\nsmall hesitation in speculating on an Archæan age. They exhibit a\r\nwonderful variety of composition. Most of the gneisses are doubtless\r\nsheared ancient igneous rocks, such as granite and diorite, and a\r\nsimilar origin may be assigned to many of the schists. Other rocks,\r\nas for instance the clay-schists, graphite-schists, and marble,\r\nhave almost certainly originated from the metamorphism of ancient\r\nsedimentary rocks. But in a large number of cases we have at present\r\nno clue to the parent rock from which the schists have been formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n        =Summary of Geological History of South-Eastern Egypt.=\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving in the foregoing pages discussed the evidences for the relative\r\nages of the different classes of rocks and their mutual relations,\r\nwe may now endeavour to reconstruct the past geological history of\r\nthis part of Egypt from the information gathered. In this process\r\nwe shall reverse the order of consideration taken above, and begin\r\nwith the oldest rocks.\r\n\r\nThe schists and gneisses probably represent, not the original crust\r\nof consolidation of the earth, but a complex of ancient sedimentary\r\nand igneous rocks, laid down in pre-Palæozoic times and subsequently\r\ncrushed, folded, and faulted into mountains which were subsequently\r\ndenuded and worn down. In parts of the main mountain-masses we may\r\npossibly still have the cores of some of these ancient elevations,\r\nbut most of the present mountain peaks are formed of a later series\r\nof igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe first igneous intrusions into the schists and gneisses were\r\nthe granites which form such peaks as Gebels Nugrus, Faraid, and\r\nElba. Then followed crushing and folding of these rocks, giving\r\nthem often a gneissose structure and opening fissures, up which came\r\nlater intrusions, mostly of basic rocks, in the form of dykes. With\r\nthe dykes or later came great basic intrusions of gabbroid rocks,\r\nforming such masses as Gebels Dahanib, Gerf, and Meisah.\r\n\r\nA long interval now followed of which the rocks contain no record. We\r\ndo not know whether the area was submerged or not in Palæozoic and\r\nearly Mesozoic times; but if it was, all trace of the deposits of\r\nthese ages has vanished in the great denudation which surely took\r\nplace before the Upper Cretaceous sea swept over the country and\r\ndeposited the Nubian sandstone. We do not know whether the Red Sea\r\nmountains then stood up as islands, or whether they were subsequently\r\nelevated. Nor do we know whether the area remained wholly or partly\r\nsubmerged during the Eocene period. But we are sure that at some time\r\nbetween the Upper Cretaceous and Oligocene epochs there was a great\r\nelevation of the land, with folding and faulting, especially in the\r\nareas now occupied by the great mountain masses, and possibly the\r\nmountains had their origin in this movement of elevation. The Red\r\nSea depression may well have originated in a complementary sinking\r\nat this same period. The depth of the sea is of the same order\r\n(2,000 metres) as the height of the mountains on the adjacent land.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding Oligocene period the land was being sculptured\r\ninto something like its present form, and probably the main drainage\r\nlines of to-day were then formed.\r\n\r\nAbout the Miocene epoch there was a sinking of the crust in this\r\nregion. The Red Sea increased in area, and then, probably as the\r\nresults of evaporation in a closed sea, deposits of gypsum were\r\nlaid down. A subsequent elevation in Pliocene or post-Pliocene times\r\nraised these deposits along the present shores.\r\n\r\nIn geologically recent times a further gentle elevation has gone on,\r\ngiving rise to slightly raised coral-reefs and sea-beaches. During\r\nthe glacial period of Europe, the rainfall in Egypt was probably\r\ngreater than at present, and during this period the great wadis\r\nreceived almost their final sculpturing. After the change from this\r\nrainy climate to the dry one of to-day, erosion still went on, though\r\nmore slowly, in the hills; but on the plains and along the coast\r\naccumulation of sands took place, partly owing to wind transport,\r\nand partly owing to the insufficiency of the drainage waters to carry\r\ntheir load as far as the Nile or sea. The abundance of coral-reefs in\r\nthe Red Sea is largely conditioned by the lack of in-flowing streams\r\nof silt-laden water; for the coral animal flourishes only where the\r\nwater is clear.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: SUESS, in _The Face of the Earth_ (English edition,\r\nVol. I, p. 374), states that “the Red Sea itself is, however,\r\na trough-subsidence, probably the greatest in the world.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n                         =TRIBAL BOUNDARIES.=\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin tribes[139] inhabiting South-Eastern Egypt are:—\r\n\r\n  _North of the administrative boundary_ (Ababda tribes):—\r\n\r\n    Ashabab.\r\n\r\n    Meleikab.\r\n\r\n  _South of the administrative boundary_ (Um Ali Bisharin tribes):—\r\n\r\n    Hamedorab\r\n\r\n               { Kurbeilab\r\n               {\r\n    Aliab      { Balgab\r\n               {            { Koatil\r\n               {            {\r\n               { Sarrarab   { Mallak[140]\r\n                            {\r\n                            { Mohammad Omerab[140]\r\n\r\nI had hoped, in surveying the country, to be able to place the\r\nboundaries of the territories of the different tribes on the field\r\nmaps, and with this object in view I ascertained the claims of\r\neach tribe as precisely as possible from representative men of the\r\ndifferent tribes who accompanied me over the ground.[141] I found that\r\nin several places the tribal claims overlapped, and in consequence I\r\nhave not inserted the boundaries on the general maps. But I was able\r\nto obtain a clear and definite idea of the various claims made at the\r\ntime, and as this information was obtained on the actual ground, I\r\npropose to set it down here as being a useful basis for consideration\r\nif ever it is necessary to decide upon the question of rival claims.\r\n\r\nOn the small scale map[142] which forms Plate XXVI, I have shown\r\nthe various claims as accurately as the scale will admit of, and a\r\nreference to it will enable the statements of claim to be generally\r\nfollowed; but as the disputed portions frequently concern somewhat\r\nsmall wadis, it will in some cases be better to refer to the larger\r\nscale maps on Plates XV, XVII, and XVIII, to follow the smaller\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nI would remark that there did not appear to be anything in the nature\r\nof a quarrel between the various tribes over the areas of disputed\r\nownership, these areas being occupied indifferently by either tribe,\r\nor by men of both tribes living amicably together. It was only when\r\nI attempted to lay down on a map the precise boundary of each tribe\r\nthat I found certain areas had two or more claimants. In the country\r\nsouth of the administrative frontier, the wells and vegetation are\r\nsufficiently abundant, in proportion to the population, for the\r\nquestion of ownership never to be a matter of heated controversy\r\nin ordinary years; and I am told that the present relationships of\r\nthe tribes are so friendly that although each tribe would resent any\r\nstatement as to ownership of its traditional grounds by the others,\r\nyet as a matter of fact no objection is raised to camels and sheep of\r\none tribe grazing in the grounds of another, a give-and-take policy\r\nbeing usual. When I was at Halaib, Sheikh Batran Ali Tiut (of the\r\nHamedorab) told me they never had disputes about grazing rights, as\r\nthere was plenty of ground for all; but if a dispute should arise,\r\nhe would no doubt be able to settle it amicably with his neighbours,\r\nby going to the place and hearing the evidence of the oldest Arabs\r\nin the particular district and letting custom and tradition decide\r\nthe point.[143]\r\n\r\n=Boundary between the Ashabab and Meleikab.=—This boundary is\r\ndefined in the Ministerial _Arrêté_ of June 25, 1902, to run along\r\nthe Wadi Hodein from the sea to Gebel Abraq, and thence southward\r\nto Gebel Um el Tiur. The only difficulty in laying down this line on\r\nthe map is in deciding which part of the great plateau of Gebel Abraq\r\nto take as the point, and which of the two Gebels Um el Tiur is meant.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Gebel Abraq (_see_ the large scale map on Plate\r\nXV), the Wadi Hodein passes its south portion; but the context of\r\nthe _Arrêté_, defines the wells of Abraq (Bir el Sunta, Bir Abu\r\nDibesat, Bir Abraq, and Bir Gumbit) to be in the Meleikab area,\r\nand as these lie further north it is obviously necessary, in the\r\nspirit of the _Arrêté_, to take a point in the north portion of\r\nGebel Abraq. From an examination of the map on Plate XV it will be\r\nseen that an easy and rational interpretation would be to regard the\r\ntriangulation point, marked by a beacon on the plateau 1,700 metres\r\nnorth-west of Bir Abraq, as being a point on the boundary; the line\r\nfrom Gebel Um el Tiur to pass through this point northwards till it\r\nouts the Wadi Abraq, and thence the boundary line would lie along\r\nthe course of Wadis Abraq and Naam to Wadi Hodein. This boundary\r\nfulfils the obvious intention of the _Arrêté_, and at the same\r\ntime has the advantage of being easily traceable on the ground.\r\n\r\nAs to the two Gebels Um el Tiur, I have already mentioned this\r\ndifficulty in connexion with the location of the administrative\r\nboundary (_see_ p. 74), and have taken the higher of the two mountains\r\nof the same name as being the one intended.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of the Meleikab boundaries, it may be\r\nworth while to mention that at the time the _Arrêté_ of 1902 was\r\nissued the country had not been surveyed; it was then thought that\r\nBir Shalatein lay some fifty kilometres further along the coast\r\nsouthward than the mouth of Wadi Hodein, and the _Arrêté_ defined\r\nthe eastern boundary of the Meleikab territory to be the coast-line\r\nfrom Wadi Hodein to Bir Shalatein. But as Bir Shalatein is actually\r\n_in_ the Wadi Hodein, the real result is that the Meleikab area\r\nends in a point on the coast, and does not include any sea-board at\r\nall. The matter is not one of great moment, because the coast-plain\r\nfor some distance southward of Wadi Hodein is very barren; but it\r\nillustrates the impossibility of defining boundaries without either\r\ngoing over the actual ground or having a reliable map.\r\n\r\n=The Hamedorab Boundary.=—The Hamedorab claim their boundary to\r\nrun from Bir Meneiga southward along the watershed of Gebel Gerf,\r\nalong the east side of the basin of Wadi Diqdib to just south of Bir\r\nBaaneit, thence to the hill called Kilia Arib, thence to the hill\r\nof Eqrun, thence to the pass of Bani Sana; at Bani Sana the boundary\r\nturns south-westward so as to pass west of Wadis Hamida and Nubitra,\r\nthen bends to the south-east passing west of Wadis Mashushenai and\r\nDibir, thence eastward along the south side of Wadi Di-ib.\r\n\r\n                                                           PLATE XXVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH-MAP SHOWING TRIBAL BOUNDARIES\r\n\r\nBall—Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Metal-Process. Survey Dept. Cairo 1911. (60-190)]\r\n\r\nThe Hamedorab state that much of the country included in the Egyptian\r\nadministration as belonging to the Ashabab is really Hamedorab\r\ncountry; they claim the north limit of their tribal territory\r\nto commence at the mouth of Wadi Khoda on the coast (in latitude\r\n23° 42′) and to pass north of Wadis Khoda, Shenshef, and Shut,\r\nthence southward passing west of Wadi Beida to Bir Meneiga.[144]\r\nThis is of course contrary to the Ministerial _Arrêté_ of 1902,\r\nand as Bramly Bey (_The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan_, Vol. I, p. 93)\r\nmentions that on the other hand the Ababda tribe assert that _their_\r\ncountry should rightly extend south of the administrative boundary,\r\nit is probable that the administrative frontier represents a fair\r\ndivision of the rival claims.\r\n\r\n=The Kurbeilab Boundary.=—The Kurbeilab claim their eastern boundary\r\nto run as follows: From Bir Meneiga southward along the watershed\r\nof Gebel Gerf to near the Sherefa pass, thence south-eastward\r\nalong the north side of Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi on to the small hill\r\ncalled Tibashoi Tomokolat, thence east-north-eastward to Gebel Hamra\r\nDom. From Gebel Hamra Dom south-eastward to the hill of Osnei, thence\r\nsouthward to the hills of Ti Keferiai, thence to the pass of Bani\r\nSana. From Bani Sana southward to Gebel Warabeit, thence along the\r\neast side of Wadi Dibir, along the north side of Wadi el Qurat, across\r\nWadi Di-ib, and then southwards along the east side of Wadi Di-ib.\r\n\r\n=The Balgab Boundary.=—The Balgab boundary coincides with the main\r\nwatershed from the parallel of 22° northwards to Gebel Adar Qaqa,\r\nthen passes between the drainages of Wadi Hasium and Wadi Soaorib\r\nto the hill called Kulet Tinasal. From Kulet Tinasal the boundary\r\nruns east-south-eastward across Wadi Soaorib, passing north of Wadi\r\nDishlo; thence it turns south along the mountains separating the\r\nbasin of Wadi Soaorib from that of Wadi Baueiwai, thence it passes\r\nsouth of the heads of Wadi Miatit, eastwards across Wadi Aqwem,\r\nalong the north side of Wadi el Qurat, across Wadi Di-ib, and then\r\nsouthwards along the eastern side of Wadi Di-ib.\r\n\r\n=The Koatil Boundary.=—The Koatil claim their boundary to run\r\nfrom the head of Wadi Diqdib, along the mountains forming the\r\neastern side of the basin of Wadi Diqdib to a point just south of\r\nBir Baaneit, thence eastward to Gebel Hamra Dom. From Hamra Dom,\r\nwest-south-westward to Tibashoi Tomokolat, thence along the north\r\nside of Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi and along the mountains forming the\r\nwest side of the basin of Wadi Diqdib up to the head of that wadi.\r\n\r\nThe Koatil further claim as their territory the upper portion of\r\nthe basin of Wadi Medarai west of longitude 35° 18′.\r\n\r\nThe Koatil also own the well called Bir Um Rasein, though all the\r\nwadis in its neighbourhood belong to the Kurbeilab.\r\n\r\n=Overlapping of Claims.=—When the boundaries of the different tribes\r\nas specified above are laid down on the map (_see_ Plate XXVI), it\r\nis found that there are three tracts claimed by more than a single\r\ntribe. These three disputed areas are:—\r\n\r\n(1) A tract south and east of Bir Baaneit, claimed both by the Koatil\r\nand by the Hamedorab. The western part of this area is relatively\r\nwell wooded. Its eastern portion includes the water source called\r\nTi Dabai Hamra Dom.[145]\r\n\r\n(2) A tract extending southward from Gebel Hamra Dom to the Wadi\r\nQurat, claimed both by the Kurbeilab and by the Hamedorab. This\r\narea includes the Wadis Hamida, Nubitra, and Dibir, and four not\r\nvery important water sources, _viz._, Galt Osnei, Megwel Hamida,\r\nBir Nubitra, and Bir Mashushenai.[146]\r\n\r\n(3) A narrow tract including the Wadis Qurat and Di-ib, claimed by\r\nall three tribes Balgab, Kurbeilab, and Hamedorab.\r\n\r\n=Ownership of Water Sources.=—With the exception of the five\r\nwater sources just mentioned as lying within the areas claimed by\r\nmore than one tribe, there are no disputes about ownership of water\r\nsupplies. The wells of the different tribes are partly enumerated\r\nin the _Arrêté_ of 1902, but as the list there given is far from\r\ncomplete and many of the names are incorrect, I give below a list of\r\nthe water sources belonging to the various tribes within the area\r\nsurveyed. For particulars of the various water sources reference\r\nshould be made to Chapter VII (p. 234).\r\n\r\n                    _Wells, etc., of the Ashabab._\r\n\r\n  Bir Muelih             Bir Helie             Igli Galt\r\n\r\n  Bir Ghadir             Bir Abu Hashim        Galt Um Tundeba\r\n\r\n  Bir Murra              Bir Shenshef          Zabara Galts\r\n\r\n  Bir Abu Had            Bir Betan             Ghuel Galts\r\n\r\n  Bir Um Gubur           Bir Rahaba            Galt Um Karaba (Migif)\r\n\r\n  Bir Masur              Bir Abu Reye          Megal Harami\r\n\r\n  Bir Ranga              Bir Abu Beid          Galt Um Gerifat\r\n\r\n  Bir Khashab            Bir Gahlia            Galt Um Gunud\r\n\r\n  Bir Abu Hamamid        Bir Orga              Galt Batoga\r\n\r\n  Bir Metawit            Bir Um Reit           Galt Um Maiat\r\n\r\n  Bir Shadli             Amar Spring           Galt el Aguz\r\n\r\n                                               Galt Seiga\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Wells, etc., of the Meleikab._\r\n\r\n                         Bir el Sunta          Bir Gumbit\r\n\r\n                         Bir Abu Dibesat       Bir Abu Saafa\r\n\r\n                         Bir Abraq             Bir Dif\r\n\r\n                                               Bir Beida\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Wells, etc., of the Hamedorab._\r\n\r\n  Bir Shalatein[147]     Bir Meheriqa          Bir Salalat O Sir\r\n\r\n  Bir Adal Deib[147]     Bir Nabit             Bir Sararat Serimtai\r\n\r\n  Bir Meneiga[148]       Bir Abu Ramad         Megwel Akau\r\n\r\n  Bir Muqur              Bir Kansisrob         Ti Kureitra\r\n\r\n  Bir Baaneit            Bir Akwamtra          Bir Frukit\r\n\r\n                         Halaib Wells          Bir Qabatit\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Wells, etc., of the Kurbeilab._\r\n\r\n  Bir Madi               Bir Shinai            Meis-heit-ar\r\n\r\n  Bir Korbiai            Bir Kagog[149]        Megwel Adar Aqdeib\r\n\r\n  Bir Meneiga[148]       Bir Guqub             Megwel Um Ein\r\n\r\n  Bir Sararat Seyet      Bir Himeitra          Megwel Um Edwa\r\n\r\n  Bir Bint el Dreb       Bir Um Bishtit[150]   Megwel Didaut[151]\r\n\r\n  Bir Odis Maaleq[149]   Bir Qidmib            Megwel Aqwem\r\n\r\n  Bir Abu Hodeid         Bir Meisah[151]       Galt Hilwit Hasium\r\n\r\n                                               Galt Kirir\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Wells of the Koatil._\r\n\r\n                         Bir Diqdib\r\n\r\n                         Bir Um Rasein\r\n\r\n  According to the _Arrêté_ of 1902, Bir Egat is Mallak property.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: _See_ notes by Mr. W.

Vol. I,\r\npp. 91-93.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: Of these two sub-tribes (Mallak and Mohammad Omerab),\r\nI did not hear anything during my travels. The Mallak country is\r\nmostly south of latitude 22°, but extends into South-Eastern Egypt\r\nround about Bir Egat, a locality which I did not visit. The Mohammad\r\nOmerab are stated by Mr. Bramly (_op. cit._) to own the wells of Bir\r\nMeisah and Megwel Didaut, which, as will be seen from what follows,\r\nare included in the area claimed as Kurbeilab by the Sheikh who\r\naccompanied me.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: The men were Sheikh Isa Ali Tiut, Sheikh of the\r\nHamedorab; Sheik Hatab (brother of Mohammad Katul, Sheikh of the\r\nKurbeilab); and Mohammad Katul Batkai, of the Kurbeilab-Aliab.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: In order to render it easier to follow the descriptions\r\nof the boundaries, I have purposely omitted from this map most of\r\nthe place-names other than those mentioned in the descriptions. The\r\nmap is to the same scale as the general orographical map on Plate I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Jennings Bramly Bey, the Senior Inspector of Berber\r\nProvince, who has kindly favoured me with some useful criticisms\r\nof this chapter, remarks: “My experience up to date is that\r\neach principal man has a different idea of his own boundaries and\r\nthat those ideas differ from day to day. My impression is that the\r\nBisharin are as yet one big family, and that the grazing is ample\r\nfor all so that the boundaries are very vague between the different\r\ntribes. Disputes of course do arise as to the possession of wadis,\r\nbut I find that a week after a certain wadi has been allotted to one\r\nof two tribes, both tribes are amicably grazing in it side by side\r\nwithout payment. The ownership of wells is more strictly defined.”]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Bir Shenshef and Bir Beida are in fact classed as\r\nbelonging to the Hamedorab in a MS. list of wells drawn up by Bramly\r\nBey. But he has doubtless so classed them before their true locality\r\nwas known; as they lie well to the north of the Sudan administrative\r\nboundary (Shenshef is over one hundred kilometres from the nearest\r\npoint of that boundary, on the Egyptian side) the Hamedorab claim\r\ncan hardly be maintained.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: This water source is recorded in Bramly Bey’s\r\nMS. list of wells as Hamedorab property.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Mr. Bramly (_Anglo-Egyptian Sudan_, Vol. I, p. 92),\r\nclasses Bir Mashushenai as Koatil. I am, however, informed that there\r\nare two wells of this same name, and this classification probably\r\nrefers to another well than the one mentioned above.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: The _Arrêté_ of 1912 ascribes these two wells to\r\nthe Ashab, a tribe of whom I heard nothing when in the neighbourhood;\r\nBramly Bey informs me that they are a sub-tribe of the Hamedorab.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: Joint Hamedorab-Kurbeilab.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: Bramly Bey, in his MS. list of wells already referred\r\nto, classes Bir Odis and Bir Kadot (probably the same as my Kagog)\r\nas Hamedorab.

The journey from Halaib to Port Sudan with baggage camels\r\noccupied eleven days, travelling on an average thirty kilometres a\r\nday. This rate of travel did not permit of any surveying being done\r\nen route, but I took brief notes of the road and the wells on it,\r\nand as this road does not appear to be included in those described\r\nin the Sudan Handbook, I give here the notes I made. The distances\r\nare estimated from the times occupied in marching.\r\n\r\nI would mention that from Mohamed Ghul onwards to Port Sudan there are\r\ntwo roads; a lower one near the sea, usually followed by the Police\r\npatrols, and an upper one which goes a little distance inland. The\r\nupper road was the one I followed, as my guides informed me that\r\nwhile it was only some eight kilometres longer than the lower one,\r\nthere was much better water to be found on it.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch maps on Plates XXVII and XXVIII, I have shown the\r\nroad and the wells on it as correctly as is possible from my notes,\r\nusing the Admiralty Chart No. 2,336 as a basis for the coast-line\r\nand the maps 36 I and 46 A, issued by the Sudan Survey Department,\r\nfor the position of Port Sudan and some topographical details. As\r\nthe direction of march was roughly north-to-south and the total\r\nestimated distances between Halaib and Mohamed Ghul, and between\r\nMohamed Ghul and Port Sudan, agree pretty well with those scaled\r\nfrom the maps after laying down the terminal positions correctly,\r\nit may be taken that the latitudes of the wells are fairly correct,\r\nwhile the longitudes are liable to greater error as being only\r\nrough estimations.\r\n\r\n                                                          PLATE XXVII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ball—Geography & Geology of South-Eastern Egypt.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Metal-Process.
