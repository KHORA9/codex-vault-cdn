What an awakening that was from sleep, the absolute and\r\nprofound sleep that follows on disaster! In a moment, as though his\r\nmind had been suddenly lit by a great flash of energy that had been\r\naccumulating since he closed his eyes, he saw the whole of the events\r\nof the last three days in their entirety; he saw the past right back to\r\nhis childhood, as men see it in that supreme moment that comes to the\r\ndrowning, and which lights recollection to its farther frontiers.\r\n\r\nHe saw the schooner _Cormorant_ landing at Ginnis' Wharf in Frisco,\r\nand he saw himself on board of it as second mate, Harrod, the first\r\nmate, standing by the weather rail, and Coxon, the skipper, just come\r\non board, wiping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief before\r\ngiving orders to cast off from the wharf where the tall Cape Horners\r\nlay moored by the Russian oil tanks, and the grain vessels by the great\r\nelevators were filling with living wheat.\r\n\r\nHe saw the Golden Gate and towering Tamalpais and the great Pacific,\r\nviolent with the ruffling of the west wind and rolling toward the\r\ncoast, to burst in eternal song on the beaches of California.\r\n\r\nThey were bound for Papeetong, away down near the Low Archipelago, with\r\na trade room well stocked and plenty of copra in prospect.\r\n\r\nThe _Cormorant_ was well found, well manned, and Coxon was an A-1\r\nschooner captain; everything promised a prosperous voyage and a quick\r\nreturn, when on the evening of the second day out Coxon had called his\r\nsecond mate down to the saloon.\r\n\r\n\"Floyd,\" said he, \"it's not for me to say a word to the second mate\r\nagainst the first, but Harrod, though he's the best chap in the world\r\nin some ways, has a weak spot, and that's drink. You notice he never\r\ntouches anything, but there's no knowing how long he's on that tack--it\r\nmay last the voyage, it mayn't. Not that he's any way out of the common\r\nwhen he's on liquor, but it's never no good to have a man boozy out\r\nof port, so, like a good chap, lead him off it if he seems taken that\r\nway. He's my own brother-in-law, and as good as they make 'em, else he\r\nwouldn't be aboard the _Cormorant_. It's my ambition to break him of\r\nit, and he's willing to be broke; still, the flesh is weak, as you'll\r\nsoon discover if you live long in this world and knock against men--and\r\nthere you are. A word to the wise.\"\r\n\r\nCoxon's own weakness was a violent temper--we all have our\r\nweaknesses--and Floyd's was a happy-go-lucky optimism that made him\r\nbelieve in all men. He was only twenty-two, the son of a parson in\r\nDevonshire, educated up to fifteen at Blundell's School, set adrift in\r\nthe world by the death of his father, and choosing the sea, prompted by\r\nthe master ambition of his life, to be a sailor.\r\n\r\nHarrod had run straight for the first week, and then he had fallen. He\r\nwould appear on deck slightly thick of speech, and sometimes he had a\r\nstagger in his walk, and he would repeat his remarks in an uncalled-for\r\nway, and tend to turn quarrelsome at the least word.\r\n\r\nThey could not tell where he got the drink from, nor did they know the\r\nfact that his condition was due neither to rum or whisky, but to samshu.\r\n\r\nSamshu is a horrible, treacly compound made by the Chinese of the\r\ncoast; it is not kept in a bottle, but in a jar, and it is the last\r\nthing in the way of intoxicants. Balloon Juice, Cape Smoke, Valley Tan\r\nvie with each other in villainy, but Samshu is the worst.\r\n\r\nIt is very rarely found out of Canton and Shanghai, and it had been\r\nbrought on board the _Cormorant_ by the Chinese cook, who traded it to\r\nHarrod for money and tobacco.\r\n\r\nA gale had struck them, driving them some hundred miles from their\r\ncourse, and when it had passed, Harrod, one afternoon, under the\r\ninfluence of this stuff, had gone into the hole where paint and\r\nvarnish were stored, carrying a light. A few minutes later came a cry\r\nof fire. Coxon was the first man on deck. He saw in a moment that there\r\nwas no hope. The varnish room was blazing like a torch, belching smoke\r\nand sparks and jets of flame like a dragon, and just as unapproachable.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done but take to the boats.\r\n\r\nThe Kanaka crew and the Chinaman whose samshu jar had done all this\r\nbundled into the longboat. Floyd ought to have been with them, but\r\nhe was held back by the work of victualing and lowering the quarter\r\nboat, and they shoved off without him, so the three officers were\r\nleft--Floyd, in the quarter-boat, and the skipper and Harrod quarreling\r\non deck. Coxon's temper had overmastered him. He was the owner of the\r\n_Cormorant_, and his whole fortune was in the trade on board.\r\n\r\nFloyd, hanging on with a boat hook, heard the shouting and stamping\r\nof the men on deck. He tried to get on board again to separate them,\r\nbut the smoke drove him back, the heat was terrific, and he cast off,\r\nrowing round to the windward side in the hope of boarding her there.\r\nAs he passed round the stern he was just in time to see the end of the\r\ntragedy, Coxon flinging Harrod over the weather rail and following him\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two men appeared again, and the reason was very\r\nobvious--the water was filled with gray, flitting shadows. The tragedy\r\nof the burning schooner had made its call through the depths of the\r\nsea, and the sharks were assembling for the feast. Floyd waited.\r\nThe whole of this terrible business had left him numb and almost\r\nunmoved. Tragedy thrills one most in the theater; on the real stage the\r\nimagination becomes paralyzed before the actual.\r\n\r\nHe pushed away farther from the flaming schooner; she was burning now\r\nlike a torch, and volumes of white smoke passed away to leeward on the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting, and the picture of the burning ship against the\r\nglowing western sky would have been unparalleled had there been eyes\r\nto see it as a picture. Floyd, gazing at it, watched while the flames,\r\nhalf invisible, like the ghosts of brightly spangled snakes, ran up the\r\nmasts. He saw the canvas wither away, and then he watched her lurch as\r\nthe seams opened to the heat and dip her bowsprit in the sea.\r\n\r\nShe settled slowly, the sea boiling about her, and then suddenly she\r\nplunged bow first and vanished.\r\n\r\nIn less than twenty seconds there was nothing to tell that a vessel had\r\nbeen there with the exception of a wreath of smoke dissolving in the\r\nblue of evening.\r\n\r\nThe upper limb of the sun had just passed beneath the horizon, and\r\nin the momentary twilight before the rush of the stars Floyd saw the\r\nlongboat, far away, and with sail hoisted to the wind.\r\n\r\nThen the night came down, and at dawn next day the longboat had\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nAs he awoke from sleep now he saw all these pictures vividly. Till the\r\nnight before he had not slept at all, and it was the return to normal\r\nconditions of his brain refreshed by sleep that now gave him a full\r\nview of his past and his position.\r\n\r\nThe quarter-boat possessed a mast and lugsail; he had stepped the mast\r\nand hoisted the sail, which now hung limp and flicking to the warm,\r\nsteadily blowing wind.\r\n\r\nHe rose up, and, standing with one hand on the mast, looked over the\r\nsea. North, south, east, and west it lay blazing in the sunshine, with\r\nnot a sign of sail or wing on the dazzle and the blueness, an infinite\r\nworld of sky, an infinite world of water all flooded by the living\r\nlight of the great golden sun.\r\n\r\nFloyd, having glanced about him, returned to his former place in the\r\nstern of the boat and began to review his stores; he had taken stock of\r\nthem twice in the last two days, but had you asked him now to give an\r\naccount of them he would have been at a loss to say exactly how they\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nThe water breaker was his first consideration. It was half full--enough\r\nto last him for six days, he reckoned. There was a full bag of ship's\r\nbread, another half full, some tins of potatoes, some tins of canned\r\nmeat, but no can opener, and a few tins of condensed milk. So much for\r\nthe provisions. There were also in the boat the ship's papers and a\r\njapanned tin box containing the ship's money. These Coxon had flung in\r\nbefore the quarrel between him and Harrod had broken out. There was\r\nnothing else at all with the exception of a boat hook and a bailer.\r\n\r\nHe had in his pockets a knife and one of those tinder boxes in which\r\nthe flint strikes on a wheel, a pocket handkerchief, a few loose\r\nmatches, and a pipe and some tobacco. It was American navy twist, and\r\nhe had nearly half a pound of it. It was the first thing he found in\r\nhis cabin on rushing down, and it was the only thing he had taken away.\r\n\r\nHaving breakfasted off a biscuit and a bit of meat from one of the\r\ncans which he managed to haggle open with his knife, he lit his pipe,\r\nbrought the sheet aft, and took the tiller. It did not matter in the\r\nleast where he steered, for Australia and China lay away to the west,\r\nthe whole continent of America to the east--both were hopeless; the Low\r\nArchipelago lay to the south, and the hope of an island was just as\r\nbrilliant in any given direction.\r\n\r\nSo he gave his sail to the wind, trusting in God.\r\n\r\nAs the morning wore on, the sea line became hung with light, fleecy\r\nclouds that deepened the far-off blue of the sea. This fringe of light\r\ncloud often hangs on the skirts of the Trades. Steering, Floyd could\r\nhear the tune of the water as it flapped on the boarding and rippled in\r\nthe wake. The breeze was not strong enough to raise any sea, and the\r\nswell was scarcely perceptible unless to the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before noon Floyd, relinquishing the tiller, stood up\r\nand, supporting himself by the mast, looked around. Then, sheltering\r\nhis eyes with his hand, he fixed his gaze straight ahead.\r\n\r\nThe sea line at one point was broken, and the sky just above the broken\r\npoint had a curious and brilliant paleness.\r\n\r\nOnce before he had seen a bit of sky like that, and he guessed it at\r\nonce to be the reflection cast upward from a lagoon island.\r\n\r\nThe sight of it dried his lips and made the sweat stand out on the\r\npalms of his hands; then, taking his place again at the tiller, he\r\nresumed his course.\r\n\r\nThe boat was making about three knots, and he reckoned that the island\r\ncould not be more than ten miles away. Were bad weather suddenly to\r\nspring on him Pacific fashion, he might either be driven out of reach\r\nof the shelter before him or sunk. But the wind held fair and steady\r\nwith no sign of squalls, and now, when he looked again, he could see\r\nthe palm-tree tops raised high above the water, and--what was that--a\r\nship?\r\n\r\nThe masts of a ship, all aslant, showed thready near the palms. She was\r\nwrecked--of that there could be no manner of doubt.\r\n\r\nThe shimmer of the sea cut off everything but the palm tops, the palm\r\nstems, and the masts; they seemed based on air.\r\n\r\nIn an hour, standing up again, Floyd made out the whole position\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\nThe island that lay before him was simply a huge ring of coral clipping\r\na lagoon a mile or more in diameter, as he afterward discovered. It\r\nwas not an even ring; here and there it swelled out into great spaces\r\ncovered with palms and artus and hotoo trees. Near the break in the\r\nreef for which he was now steering, piled up on the coral literally\r\nhigh and dry, lay the carcass of what had recently been a schooner of\r\nsome two hundred tons.\r\n\r\nShe must have been sent right up by some great lift of the sea.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near he could see that the planking had been literally\r\nstripped off her from a huge space reaching from the stern post almost\r\nto midship; there was no rudder; the sails, he thought, had either\r\nblown away or flogged themselves to pieces, taking with them gaffs\r\nand booms. Then he remembered that the masts, still standing by some\r\nmiracle, would certainly have snapped like carrots had sail enough been\r\non her to carry away the spars like that. He could not tell. The thing\r\nhypnotized him as he watched it, his hand on the tiller and the opening\r\nof the reef before him.\r\n\r\nThough the sea was as calm as the Pacific can ever be, a steady surf\r\nwas breaking on the reef. The boom of it came to him now against the\r\nwind, and the boat heaved to the short sea made by the resistance of\r\nthe great coral breakwater.\r\n\r\nIt was like the bourdon note of an organ, and though it swelled and\r\nsank it never ceased, for it was the tune that ringed forever the whole\r\nfour-mile circuit of the atoll.\r\n\r\nThen as he passed the coral piers and opened the lagoon, the sound of\r\nthe surf grew less loud and the boat went on an even keel.\r\n\r\nBefore him lay the great blue pond, calm as a summer lake; the shore\r\nsurrounding it showed long beaches of salt-white coral sand and great\r\nspaces of foliage; palms and breadfruit, mammee apple bushes and cane,\r\ncolonies of trees all moving, gently pressed upon by the warm trade\r\nwind, whose breath made violet meadows on the broad lagoon.\r\n\r\nIt was the most extraordinary place in the world.\r\n\r\nIt had a touch of the ornamental, as though some city more vast and\r\nwealthy and populous than any city we know of had decreed this great\r\nspace of water as a pleasure lake, ordered the white of sand and\r\ngreen of foliage, emerald of shallow water and blue of deep, and then\r\nvanished, leaving its pleasure place to the wastes of ocean.\r\n\r\nThe water at the opening of the lagoon was very deep, but inside it\r\nshoaled rapidly, and Floyd, glancing over the thwart, saw the white\r\nsand patches and coral lumps of the lagoon floor almost as clearly as\r\nthough he were gliding over them through air.\r\n\r\nHe swept the circular beach with a glance, flung up his hand to shade\r\nhis eyes, and then with a shout put the helm over and hauled the sheet\r\nto port.\r\n\r\nAway on the beach to the right something flapped; it was the sailcloth\r\nof a rudely made tent, and by the tent, waving its arm, stood the\r\nfigure of a man; by the man, squatting on the beach sand, was another\r\nfigure, small and difficult to distinguish.\r\n\r\nFloyd instantly connected these figures with the wreck; they were\r\nevidently the remains of the shipwrecked crew.\r\n\r\nAs he drew closer the man on the beach showed up more clearly--a\r\nbronzed and bearded man in dubiously white clothes, and the figure\r\nseated on the sand revealed itself as a girl; she was almost as dark as\r\nthe man, and she was seated with her hands clasping her knees.\r\n\r\nHe unstepped the mast and took to the sculls; a minute later the stem\r\nof the boat was grinding the sand of the beach, and Floyd was over the\r\nside helping to pull her up.\r\n\r\nBefore they exchanged a word they pulled her up sufficiently to keep\r\nher from drifting off with the outgoing tide. It was easy to see they\r\nwere sailors.\r\n\r\n\"She's all right,\" said the bearded man; \"and where in the name of\r\neverything have you come from?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd flung both hands on the shoulders of the other. It was not till\r\nthis moment that he had borne in on him the frightful loneliness and\r\nthe fate from which he had escaped.\r\n\r\n\"I'd never hoped to see a living man again,\" said he. \"Never, never,\r\nnever! You're real, aren't you? Don't mind me. I'm half cracked; your\r\nfist--there--I'm better now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrecked?\" said the bearded man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; wrecked, burned out. The _Cormorant_ was the name, bound from\r\nFrisco to Papeetong; drink and fire did for us----\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short. He had been staring at the girl. She had shifted\r\nher position only slightly, and she was looking at him with eyes that\r\nshowed little interest and less emotion--the eyes of a person who is\r\ngazing at shapes in a fire or at some object a great distance off.\r\n\r\nShe was a Polynesian--a wonderfully pretty girl, almost a child,\r\nhoney-colored, with a string of scarlet beads showing on her neck about\r\nthe scanty garment that covered her, and with a scarlet flower in her\r\njet-black hair.\r\n\r\nIt was a flower of the hibiscus that grew in profusion in all the\r\ngroves of the atoll.\r\n\r\n\"That's Isbel,\" said the bearded man. \"Kanaka, called after the place\r\nshe came from. Isbel Island in the Marshalls. I'm Schumer, trader\r\nand part owner of the _Tonga_. There she is\"--jerking his thumb at\r\nthe wreck. \"Hove up in a gale a month ago; we've been here a month;\r\nevery man jack drowned but me and Isbel. I've salved a bit of the\r\ncargo--foodstuffs and suchlike. What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Floyd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's as good as any other name in these parts, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the sand near the girl, and Floyd did likewise. Then\r\nSchumer, taking a pipe and some tobacco from his pocket, began to\r\nsmoke. He talked all the time.\r\n\r\n\"We've rigged up a bit of a tent. Isbel prefers to sleep out in the\r\nopen. Kanaka. Not much between them and beasts except the hide. Well,\r\ntell us about yourself. What's the name of the schooner did you say\r\nwas burned?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd told; told the whole story while Schumer listened, smoking,\r\nlolling on his back and cutting in every now and then with a question.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, when the other had finished, \"that lays over most\r\nyarns I've heard. And what's become of that boatload of Kanakas, I\r\nwonder? Starved out most likely. Good for you they took their hook;\r\ngood for me, too, for now we've got your boat, and a boat's a handy\r\nthing. We can get across the lagoon easy, for there's no getting round\r\non foot beyond that clump of cocoanuts on the shore edge there. There's\r\na quarter mile or so of broken coral all that way; razors ain't in it\r\nbeside broken coral. We can fish, too, and it may be handy to have\r\na boat if we sight a ship, though this island is clean out of trade\r\ntracks. We were blown two hundred miles from our course.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was your cargo?\" asked Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Printed stuffs, tinware, and general trade; a missionary--he was\r\nwashed overboard--and several passenger Kanakas under him. Isbel\r\nbelonged to his lot. She can talk English--can't you, Isbel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the girl.\r\n\r\nIt was the first thing she had uttered, and Floyd noticed the softness\r\nof her voice and the way she avoided the \"y,\" or rather the hardness of\r\nit, without breaking the word or mutilating it.\r\n\r\n\"It was the storm of storms,\" said Schumer; \"there we were, running\r\nbefore it with scarcely a rag of canvas set and every wave threatenin'\r\nto be our last, every man jack on deck clinging to whatever he\r\ncould hold when the great smash came. I don't know how I escaped.\r\nProvidence, mostlike--same with Isbel, though I guess she's so little\r\naccount she escaped the way some did in the earthquake out in Java\r\nthree years ago. I saw a whole family flattened out under their own\r\nroof and a basket of kittens saved. It's that way things work in this\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Floyd, lying on his back on the sand--there was shade here\r\nfrom the trees--\"I'm jolly glad you were saved. Good Lord, it's only\r\ncoming on me now, the whole business; it's just as if one had escaped\r\nfrom the end of the world. It's not good to be drifting about in a boat\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer agreed.\r\n\r\nFloyd had now taken stock of his new companion. He was a powerfully\r\nbuilt man with a bold and daring face, a trifle hard, perhaps--hard\r\ncertainly one would say in striking a bargain; he was tanned by sun\r\nand wind, and despite his name he spoke English like an Englishman;\r\nsometimes the faintest trace of an American accent was perceptible,\r\nand sometimes the inimitable American cast of words lending color and\r\npicture to his conversation.\r\n\r\nFloyd liked him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, rising up, \"let's go and have a look at the\r\nold hulk; there's some more stuff worth salving--not that if I had a\r\nderrick and more boats and a ship to lade the stuff in I wouldn't salve\r\nthe lot. By the way, what did you bring off in that boat of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's some biscuits and canned stuff, and a tin box with the ship's\r\npapers and some money--nothing much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Money, did you say--how much?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd told him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, \"money's not of any use to us here--wish it was;\r\nall the same, it's worth having, for there's no knowing the moment the\r\ndoor may be opened for us to get out of here.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way toward the wreck, Floyd and Isbel following.\r\n\r\nThe coral islands of the Pacific may be roughly divided into two\r\nclasses: compound islands--that is to say, islands made of solid land\r\nand surrounded by a coral ring or breakwater, and simple islands or\r\natolls--that is, simple rings of coral inclosing lagoons.\r\n\r\nThen we have occasionally a third variety, an atoll island in whose\r\nlagoon one finds several islets.\r\n\r\nThis island that Floyd had struck was of the simple variety; the lagoon\r\nwas of an irregular form, circular as a whole, yet here and there\r\nmaking bays in the coral.\r\n\r\nThe coral ring had four definite areas upon which vegetation\r\nflourished; one might say that the ring inclosing the lagoon consisted\r\nof four islands, each joined to each by naked coral.\r\n\r\nThe _Tonga_ had been lifted by one great heave of the sea right onto\r\nthe raw coral of the northern pier of the reef. It was not so great\r\na feat, after all, for the reef was lower than elsewhere, and ships\r\nbefore this have been lifted over atoll reefs and deposited upside down\r\nin lagoons.\r\n\r\nThe _Tonga_ was not upside down, but she was broken fore and aft, and\r\nthe fact that her masts were still standing formed another incident in\r\nthat category of strange incidents--the story of the power of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe rudder had been plucked off and lay there like a great barn door\r\nflung down on the coral; the pintles were gone as though they had been\r\ntorn from the wood by forceps; the planking, as I have already said,\r\nwas stripped from the port side right to midships; she lay with a list\r\nto port, and through the great gaping wound where the ribs of the\r\nvessel showed like the ribs of a half-devoured carcass, the contents\r\nof the trade room and cabin could be seen half shed on the coral, half\r\nstill contained.\r\n\r\nBales of print, kegs and cases, burst boxes of canned provisions, bird\r\ncages, trade gin, some cases of cheap rifles destined for the King of\r\nApaka, who was in revolt against German rule, and who was anxiously\r\nawaiting the consignment--these and twenty more varieties of things lay\r\nthere festering in the sun, watched by the sea birds and blown upon by\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens,\" said Floyd, \"what a spill!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just that,\" said Schumer, \"and it's not good to see so much stuff\r\ngone to waste, especially when one's money has paid for it, or part\r\npaid for it. It wasn't all my venture. There's a man at Sydney who's my\r\npartner. Well, there's no use crying over spilled goods; let's try and\r\ndo what we can. Now you are here we may be able to salve more of the\r\nstuff than I had hoped. First thing is to get some of the perishables\r\nunder shade. The sun doesn't hurt rifles, but it doesn't improve prints\r\nand provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll help,\" said Floyd; \"anything's better than doing nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come along, my son,\" replied Schumer. \"Claw hold of the other end\r\nof this case, and you, Isbel, follow along with that mat of rice.\"\r\n\r\nA few mats of rice had been among the cargo of the _Tonga_, and though\r\nhere on the island there was evidence of an abundance of food, Schumer\r\nseemed to pay especial attention to the salving of provisions. Perhaps\r\nwith that keen brain of his, which had carried him so far in life\r\nagainst tremendous odds, he foresaw the time when these same provisions\r\nwould be more valuable as a trade asset than minted gold.\r\n\r\nThey worked for several hours, and then knocked off and came back to\r\nwhere the tent was pitched.\r\n\r\nSchumer proceeded to light a fire, while Floyd and Isbel got together\r\nthe things for supper.\r\n\r\nSchumer the day before had managed to catch a small turtle, and he\r\nnow set to to grill some of the flesh. He also boiled some water for\r\ncoffee, and in half an hour Floyd found himself before the best supper\r\nhe had ever sat down to.\r\n\r\n\"It's good for us there's water here,\" said Schumer, when they had\r\nfinished. \"You see, if this island had been a ring of coral hove up out\r\nof the sea there wouldn't have been any natural water here, but it's\r\nnot. It's my belief it's more a ring of mountaintops just showing with\r\ncoral bridging between; anyhow, there's lots of water--at least enough\r\nfor us. Well, we'll take your boat out in the morning and have a good\r\nlook at the lagoon, and see what we can find in those bays over there.\r\nI've got some fishing tackle and we can fish--shellfish makes good\r\nbait; there's no fishing of any account to be had on the shore edge,\r\nbut there's big things to be done out in the lagoon.\"\r\n\r\nHe filled his pipe and lit it, and they smoked for a while in silence.\r\nThe sun was setting, and from the great ring of coral came the sound\r\nof the surf, continuous, dreamy and less loud to the ears of Floyd\r\nthan when he had first landed. In a little time he would not hear it;\r\nor, rather, he would not notice; it was one of the conditions of life\r\nhere, a part of the strangeness of this strange place where perfect\r\npeace dwelt forever ringed around by the murmur of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said Schumer, after a few minutes' silence; \"what about\r\nthat money you said you had in the boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the ship's money and papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're in the boat still,\" said Floyd, rising up.\r\n\r\nHe went to the boat where she lay high and dry on the sand, and took\r\nout the tin box.\r\n\r\nHe brought it back to where Schumer and Isbel were sitting by the\r\nembers of the fire, and, taking his place on the sand beside them,\r\nopened the box and took out the bag of sovereigns.\r\n\r\nHe undid the string and poured the contents of the bag onto the hard\r\nsand of the beach.\r\n\r\nThere were two hundred and ten sovereigns--as they afterward\r\ncounted--and the moon, which had just pushed up its face over the\r\neastern reef edge, lit the pile which Floyd was now stirring with his\r\nfinger, while Schumer, who had drawn himself closer on his elbow,\r\nlooked on without a word. Isbel had drawn closer, too.\r\n\r\nShe had spoken very little as yet, and when she spoke it was a pleasure\r\nto listen.\r\n\r\nTo attempt the reproduction of Polynesian speech is fatal, and the\r\nauthors who attempt it succeed in producing only a disgusting form of\r\npidgin English. It is impossible to reproduce the inflections, the\r\nsoftness, the timbre, the soul of it. It is equally impossible to\r\nreproduce the infantile French of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIsbel's language was the human equivalent of the language of the\r\nsoft-voiced birds; more than that, the missionary who had brought her\r\nup had guarded her from the vile \"savvee\" and \"um\" and \"allee same\"\r\nthat foul the speech of the lower natives.\r\n\r\nHow much the missionary teaching had bent her mind to Eastern ideals or\r\ninfluenced her nature it would be impossible to say. There was a great\r\ndeal of mystery about Isbel, centuries and centuries of the unknown and\r\nunrealized gazing from those eyes so dark and unfathomable.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, breaking the silence at last, \"that's a decent\r\npile, and what are you going to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's Coxon's,\" said Floyd, \"and now he's dead it will belong to\r\nhis next of kin; he hadn't a wife and family, so he told me, but he's\r\nsure to have relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every man has who dies worth a cent,\" said Schumer. \"Question is how\r\nare you to find them, and whether they'll thank you if you do find\r\nthem, or swear that you've nailed half the boodle. You said the chap\r\nthat fired the schooner was Coxon's brother-in-law; well, it 'pears to\r\nme you've suffered a good bit from his relations already, and deserve\r\nsome recompense. If I were you I'd put those papers in the fire and the\r\nmoney in your pocket--however, that's your affair, not mine.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd put papers and money back in the tin box.\r\n\r\n\"I'll put them in the tent for the present,\" said he; \"there's lots of\r\ntime to think over the matter, and little chance enough to act in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, \"you can do as you please when the time\r\ncomes--and I wish it would come. I'm about sick of hanging here doing\r\nnothing. I'm going to turn in. I sleep in the tent, and there's room\r\nfor you, too. Isbel has made a wigwam in the bush--the boat's all\r\nright; she's high above the level of the tide.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the great moon, swinging above the island, showed\r\nnothing but the embers of the fire, the trodden sand and the tent;\r\nthe human beings whom the Fates had brought together on this lost and\r\nlonely spot had vanished, touched by sleep, just as men vanish from the\r\nworld when touched by Death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF THE LAGOON\r\n\r\n\r\nFloyd awoke shortly after sunup.\r\n\r\nThe gulls were shouting and flying against the blaze of the sunrise,\r\nfleeting like snowflakes across the blue sky beyond the reef opening,\r\nand fishing at the pierheads.\r\n\r\nWhen the great lagoon was emptying or filling to the tide, the water\r\nat the pierheads went like a mill race; at slack water it lay gently\r\nflowing to the swell of the outside sea as now.\r\n\r\nFloyd came from under the tent, glanced round him, stretched himself,\r\nand then crossed the reef to the outer beach, where the breakers were\r\ncoming in--the eternal breakers of the Pacific, leisurely, monotonous,\r\nrhythmical, filling the air with their sound and spindrift, their ozone\r\nand life.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more extraordinary than the contrast between the inner\r\nbeach and the outer beach of the island. You stood now facing a great\r\nlake, calm and colored with all the blues and greens of tropical water\r\nthat varies in depth, and now, crossing the reef, you stood on the\r\nshore of a thunderous sea.\r\n\r\nFloyd stripped himself of his clothes and went into the surf. When he\r\nhad bathed and dried himself in the sun, he returned to the camp, where\r\nhe found Schumer lighting the fire and Isbel preparing breakfast. They\r\ngreeted him and he fell to to help.\r\n\r\nHe felt for the moment gay; the brightness, the sense of early morning,\r\nthe sea breeze and the crying gulls all raised his spirits to the\r\nhighest pitch.\r\n\r\nEven Schumer, older and unenthusiastic to everything but trade, seemed\r\nmore cheerful than usual.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take the boat now,\" said he, when breakfast was finished,\r\n\"and prospect the lagoon. We want to get soundings, anyhow, in case\r\na ship should come and may want anchorage inside. This island isn't\r\ncharted--at least it's not on the British admiralty charts. I have the\r\n_Tonga_ charts in the tent, and they make it all clear water from the\r\nspot where the hurricane took us to three hundred miles south, and we\r\ndidn't run more than a hundred and fifty before we tripped over the\r\nreef.\r\n\r\n\"South of the three-hundred-mile limit there's a group of small\r\nislands, but they are not atolls. Now we're clear out of trade tracks\r\nand unknown, though you may be sure whalers have been here, for there's\r\nnowhere in the Pacific that whalers haven't pushed their noses, and\r\nwhalers are useless to us. We don't want any blubber tanks showing\r\ntheir dirty hulls here; if they took us aboard they would drop us again\r\nat any decent port till after, maybe, a three years' cruise, and then\r\nthey'd land us God knows where, crippled with work and tuppence in our\r\npockets. No, sir, if any dirty whalers show their faces here they'll\r\nget bullets before they get us on board. Well, come on and help float\r\nthe boat.\"\r\n\r\nThey got the boat off, and in a few minutes were out in the lagoon,\r\nIsbel forward, Floyd at the sculls, and Schumer in the stern sheets.\r\n\r\n\"There's breeze enough for the sail,\" said Schumer, when they were a\r\nhundred yards or so out. \"Shove the mast up, and we'll take it easy. I\r\nwant to have a full look at the floor of this lagoon, and take my time\r\nover it.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd took in the sculls, and, helped by Isbel, who seemed to have a\r\ngood knowledge of boat craft, got the mast stepped. Then they shook the\r\nsail out, and the boat scarcely heeling to the gentle breeze, they made\r\nstraight across the stretch of water between them and the northernmost\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the lagoon was not of equal depth; near the break in the\r\nreef it was thirty-fathom water, shoaling swiftly to ten and five.\r\nThe whole western half of the lagoon was three fathoms and under. At\r\nseveral places in this shallow zone the coral floor rose sharply and\r\nnearly reached the surface. It was necessary, indeed, to unstep the\r\nmast and take to the sculls, while Isbel, leaning over the bow, conned\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe water was so clear that the shadow of the boat showed hard on the\r\nsand patches; looking down, the eye was held by a thousand things\r\nbeautiful and strange. Color dwells like a wizard in tropical and\r\nsubtropical waters; it seems inherent in those seas. Shells, fish, and\r\ncoral all are gorgeous, and more than gorgeous--exquisite. Here seem to\r\nlie the remnants of a world more beautiful than any world we know--the\r\nruins of a paradise.\r\n\r\nCoral alone presents to us a whole world of art; its colors and its\r\nforms are infinite, and the artists of Paris or Tokyo make nothing\r\nmore beautiful than the million art treasures eternally being formed\r\nin the depths and the shallows of the sea. Not only in the Pacific,\r\nbut the Atlantic, not only in the Atlantic, but the Indian Ocean, from\r\nthree-fathom water to a mile deep the construction of the beautiful is\r\neternally in progress, unviewed and almost unknown.\r\n\r\nFloyd, resting on his oars now and then, looked over into the luminous\r\ndepths where flights of painted fish passed, their shadows following\r\nthem over the sand patches and brain coral.\r\n\r\nHere and there were streaks of dead and rotten coral of a seaweed\r\nbrown, and here and there veritable gardens of color. Great shells\r\nmoved about on the sand patches, crabs scurried hither and thither,\r\nglobe-shaped jellyfish passed clear as glass, showing up for the\r\nmoment by reflected light, and then vanishing like ghosts. Schumer,\r\nhis battered old panama tilted back to protect his neck from the sun,\r\nseemed absorbed in the things below; he spoke scarcely a word, unless\r\nto give direction to the rower; Isbel, heedless of the sun, was equally\r\nabsorbed. Always on the lookout for the shoal water, she said nothing\r\nexcept to give the direction \"To the right,\" \"To the left,\" and on the\r\nheaving of a sudden rock up through the brilliant water, \"Ah, stop\r\nhard!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of this western part of the lagoon was very difficult water;\r\nunless buoyed it would be utterly unnavigable by a ship even of small\r\ntonnage.\r\n\r\nSchumer, having explored the northernmost part of this zone, gave\r\ndirections to Floyd to pull farther south.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely entered this area when Floyd's attention became\r\nattracted to his companion. Schumer, leaning over the side and holding\r\nthe thwart with his left hand, suddenly became rigid. The muscles of\r\nhis neck stood out stiff, and his hand seemed trying to crush the wood\r\nof the thwart.\r\n\r\nThen he turned with a great cry:\r\n\r\n\"Shell! Acres of shell--pearls! We've struck it!\" Floyd, as excited as\r\nSchumer, drew in his sculls and looked over.\r\n\r\nFortune wears many cloaks, but her ugliest is formed of oysters. As far\r\nas Floyd could see, to right, to left, ahead, and astern, the floor of\r\nthe lagoon was an oyster bed; all beauty of coral had vanished, and the\r\nwater seemed deserted even by the colored fish that haunted the deeper\r\nparts of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"Row on,\" said Schumer; \"let's see how far it stretches. It is the\r\nbiggest find I ever expected to strike. I fancied there might be shell,\r\nI was on the lookout for shell, but it was only an idea of mine, and\r\nnow it's here, a fortune right in our hands.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd got out the sculls and the boat moved south.\r\n\r\nSchumer was right when he had said \"acres of shell.\" An hour's\r\nprospecting gave them the fact that the whole southern area of this the\r\nwestern portion of the lagoon was shell. There were three main beds\r\nwith coral between, millions and millions of oysters, tons upon tons of\r\nshell, and no man could say the possibilities in the way of pearls.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished prospecting they beached the boat, and taking\r\nshelter from the sun under the shade of a little grove of artus and\r\npura trees, set to on the provisions they had brought with them.\r\n\r\nRight across the lagoon from where they sat they could see their\r\ncamping place and the tent, the wreck, and the opening in the reef all\r\nin the blue weather, and beyond the opening in the reef a glimpse of\r\nthe great Pacific and the fringe of pearl-white clouds on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, as they finished their meal, \"the stuff is there\r\nright enough, and it only comes now to the question of lifting it. We\r\nhave no labor, or none to speak of. Of course, we'll dredge and dive\r\nso as to get as much samples as we can, but we want twenty men on the\r\nwork, and I don't see how we're to do it without letting others into\r\nthe secret. It's this way: Some time or another a vessel is sure to\r\nhappen along here and take us off; well, if it does we must keep mum.\r\nOur object will be to get to Frisco or Sydney, and there get hold\r\nof some chap with money and form a little syndicate. That'll water\r\nthe profits considerable; he'll want half at least. But there you\r\nare--what's to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Floyd; \"we can't move without labor, and even that's no\r\nuse without a ship. To rig an expedition up at Frisco or Sydney will\r\ncost a lot, and you may be sure any speculator who puts his money into\r\nthe thing will want to gobble most of the profits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before we'd let him into the know we'd make him sign a paper,\" said\r\nSchumer, \"stating his acceptance of our terms, and then we'd make him\r\nkeep his bond with a pistol to his head. I don't trust the law alone,\r\nbut the law backed by a derringer makes a pretty good security.\"\r\n\r\nAs Schumer spoke, Floyd, who was watching his profile cut hard against\r\nthe sky, noticed for the first time the flatness of the cheek bones\r\nand the relationship between the nose and chin.\r\n\r\nSchumer was a very quiet man in his speech and manner, yet there was\r\nabout him an assured confidence speaking of great reserves of energy;\r\nand now for the first time, as though the thought of being robbed of\r\nhis treasure had revealed it, there peeped out a new man; something of\r\nthe bird of prey showed in that profile, something of the desperado\r\nfound echo in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Floyd, \"there's no use in making plans till we have\r\nsomething to go on. Let's settle on our immediate business; we'll have\r\nto get oysters up and rot them in the sun to see if there's any show\r\nof pearls, and it seems to me that we are very well placed for that.\r\nSuppose a ship comes into the lagoon; well, she can't come within a\r\nmile of this beach on account of the shoal water, and she won't be able\r\nto see our work. I propose we stick to our old camp by the wreck, and\r\ncome here every day to work. We can leave Isbel on guard at the camp,\r\nand if she sights a ship she can light a fire to give us warning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's sense,\" replied Schumer, who had become himself again. \"We can\r\nrot the oysters on the weather side of the reef, and we'll set to work\r\non the business to-morrow morning. Let's get back now to the camp. I'm\r\ngoing to fix up a dredge. Did I tell you I was a bit of an engineer?\r\nI've had to be a bit of everything this time or that. I once edited a\r\npaper and wrote it mostly, from the poetry column to the produce. I\r\nguess I'd have written books if my lines had been cast in quiet waters.\r\nTrade has always kept me going, and here where there's palm trees and\r\nblue water enough trade turns up in oysters.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were fixed across the lagoon on the palms near the wreck; the\r\nhawk-like look had vanished, and he murmured half to himself the verse\r\nof Scheffel:\r\n\r\n  \"_Zwölf Palmen ragten am Meeresstrand\r\n  Um eine alte Cisterne._\"\r\n\r\nIt was \"_Dun Tode Nah_\" he was repeating, and Floyd, who did not know\r\nthe verse, knew the language.\r\n\r\n\"You speak German?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"My father was a German,\" replied Schumer. \"I speak four languages and\r\nhalf a dozen Polynesian dialects. One has to. Well, shall we get back?\r\nThere is nothing more to be done here for the present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSCHUMER'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThey rowed back across the lagoon to the camp, and there Schumer set to\r\non the construction of his dredge.\r\n\r\nFloyd had suddenly found an object of interest on the island almost as\r\nabsorbing as the oyster bed, and that object was Schumer.\r\n\r\nSchumer had seemed to him at first a simple trader bound up in trade,\r\none of a class that swarms in the Pacific. Bound up in trade he\r\nundoubtedly was, but there was all the difference in the world between\r\nhim and the others of his class that Floyd had come across in his\r\nwanderings.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the hardest thing in the world to put one's finger on is\r\npersonality, or the power that tells in a man's appearance, actions,\r\nand speech. Its essence lies in complexity, and is born of all the\r\nmultitudinous attributes that form spirit.\r\n\r\nFloyd watched Schumer working on the dredge, and wondered at his\r\ningenuity and power over metal and wood. He had but little material to\r\nhis hand--cask hoops and old ironwork from the wreck, and so on--yet he\r\nmade the most of it, and did not grumble. He explained the mechanism of\r\nthe thing when he had finished. He had set Isbel to work stitching the\r\ncanvas bag which was part of the dredge, and she sat mysterious as a\r\nsphinx, working and listening to him as he talked.\r\n\r\nThen, later on, as they smoked after supper and watched the stars break\r\nout over the lagoon, Schumer went on talking, now of trade and the wild\r\nwork he had seen here and there in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nHe was vague, rarely giving the names of islands or places, contenting\r\nhimself with such wide terms as \"It was an island south of the\r\nMarshalls,\" or \"It was down in the Solomons.\" It was down in the\r\nSolomons that he had got the scar on his arm which he showed to Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"That's fifteen years old,\" said he; \"it missed the artery or I\r\nwouldn't be here now. I was only twenty then and new to the islands,\r\nnew to the sea also. I'd taken passage in a big schooner; two hundred\r\nand fifty tons she was, captained by a Yankee skipper, and manned by\r\nthe biggest crowd of rascals that ever sailed out of Frisco to meet\r\nperdition.\r\n\r\n\"We put in at a big island southeast of Manahiki. I went ashore with\r\nthe old man, the first mate, and two of the hands that could be\r\ntrusted. We were all well armed, and lucky for us we were.\r\n\r\n\"It was the bos'n who started the trouble--a big, black-bearded chap,\r\nhalf Irish, quarter Scotch, with a tar brush somewhere in his family.\r\nNot a good mixture by any means.\r\n\r\n\"We hadn't been ashore ten minutes when this chap took the schooner.\r\nThere were no preliminaries. She had a big brass swivel gun, and he\r\nturned it on the beach and let fly. He'd loaded her with a bag of\r\nbullets, and the first shot smashed the boat we'd landed in, smashed\r\nthe only canoes in the place, and tore up the sand as if it had been\r\nplowed. Fortunately we had seen his game and scattered, but two natives\r\nwere killed, and the rest took to the bush.\r\n\r\n\"So did we, and under cover of the leaves we watched what was going on\r\nin the schooner.\r\n\r\n\"They seemed pretty satisfied with themselves. They were sure against\r\nattack; they had smashed our boat and the canoes, and they were pretty\r\ncertain we wouldn't try to board them by swimming, for the lagoon was\r\nfull of sharks. They brought up grog and took to dancing on deck. Their\r\nobject, of course, was to get away with the schooner and all the trade\r\non board, change her name, and make for some port on the South American\r\ncoast, and sell schooner and cargo and all. There was money aboard,\r\ntoo--the ship's money and some coin of the old man's, and fifty British\r\nsovereigns of my own hid in my bunk, though the beggars did not guess\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they should have knocked the shackle off the anchor chain and\r\ngot to sea at once; they chose instead to drink and dance, celebrating\r\ntheir victory. You see they did not know whom they were dealing with.\r\n\r\n\"From where we lay we could have picked them off like crows with our\r\nrifles. Of course, that would have meant they would have gone below\r\nand hid, and then at dark they'd have gone away. It would have sobered\r\nthem, too, and I did not want that.\r\n\r\n\"So we let them be, putting our trust in the bottle, and we set to and\r\nmade a raft with the help of some of the natives who were hiding in the\r\nbush with us.\r\n\r\n\"There was a little creek hidden from the schooner by a cape of coconut\r\nand pandanus trees, and we made the raft there, and a rotten raft it\r\nwas; but it served our purpose, and when dark came down we shoved off,\r\nus four and two natives.\r\n\r\n\"The tide was with us; it was running out of the lagoon. The natives\r\nhad canoe paddles, but they scarcely used them. Not a soul was on deck;\r\nthey were all in the saloon drinking, and the noise was worse than a\r\ntavern on the Barbary Coast of a Saturday night. They wouldn't have\r\nheard us coming alongside if we had come blowing trumpets--which we\r\ndidn't.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer paused to refill and light his pipe. The lagoon was now a sheet\r\nof stars, and not a sound came but the murmur of the reef and the\r\nsplash of a fish jumping in the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"We came alongside, and in a minute we were over the rail--she had a\r\nlow freeboard--every man of us. We didn't trouble about the raft, and\r\nshe went out to sea on the tide.\r\n\r\n\"The saloon hatch was off, and there they were all crowded like bees\r\nin a bottle fighting and playing cards and drinking and smoking, and\r\nthere as they sat we began to plug them with our Winchesters. We got\r\nsix before the smoke of the firing hid them, and then we fired into\r\nthe smoke and stood by to down them as they came up the companionway.\r\nThey were plucky, but mad with drink, and they had no arms to speak of.\r\nOne of them had a bottle in his hand, the only thing he could find to\r\nfight with; when he tumbled over into the lee scuppers he still held it\r\nunbroken, and I guess he went before his Maker with it like that.\r\n\r\n\"We settled them all with the exception of the bos'n. He skulked\r\nbelow, and I went down to find him. The saloon was clear of smoke and\r\nthe swinging lamp was burning; dead men were lying everywhere, but no\r\nbos'n. He'd taken refuge in the old man's cabin and had barricaded\r\nthe door, so that I couldn't kick it in--only managed to crack the\r\npaneling; so I began firing through it with my revolver, and then out\r\nhe came with two bullets in him and a sheath knife in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"He gave me this cut before we had done with one another.\r\n\r\n\"The upshot was that every man of them was given his dose, and we took\r\nthe schooner out of the lagoon, us four, with four Kanakas who joined\r\nthe ship, and we had good luck all the rest of the voyage, though my\r\narm inflamed so that I nearly lost it.\r\n\r\n\"So you see a trader's life out here is not all trading; one has to\r\nfight sometimes for what one gets, and to keep what one gets.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd could not help thinking that Schumer's part in the recapture of\r\nthe schooner had been more than he had stated.\r\n\r\n\"What's made you take to trading out here?\" he asked. \"You're a sailor,\r\naren't you? At least I made the guess yesterday that you were a sailor\r\nfirst and a trader after.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I began as a sailor. I served my two years before these new\r\ntopsail yards made reefing child's work. I served in a Hamburg ship.\r\nWhat made me a trader? Well, I suppose it was the common sense that\r\nmade me give up sailoring. I do not like hard manual labor. As I\r\ntold you before, it was on the cards that I might have cast my lines\r\nin the newspaper world. Books interest me, written books; the world\r\ninterested me, and I might have been the correspondent of newspapers.\r\nI am a fair linguist, and I can write simple English and picture fairly\r\nwell what I see in words; yet I am a trader. I do not know why I am a\r\ntrader in the least. It is the way of life that has come to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and they sat in silence for a moment.\r\n\r\nFloyd, looking round, saw that Isbel had vanished; she had slipped off\r\nto bed somewhere in the bush--slipped off like an animal. It was her\r\ncharacteristic that she was one of the shipwrecked party, yet remained\r\napart. She helped in cooking and boat sailing and in other ways;\r\nbut she lived her own life as an animal lives it, thinking her own\r\nthoughts, keeping her own counsel, speaking little. There was nothing\r\nabout her of the childish and the light-hearted that stamps so many\r\nPolynesians, which is not to say that she was gloomy or too old for\r\nher years. She was just a creature apart, and had always the air of a\r\nlooker-on at a game in which she helped, but which did not particularly\r\ninterest her.\r\n\r\n\"The girl's gone,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nSchumer looked round.\r\n\r\n\"Crept off to sleep; she'll sleep anywhere--in a tree or in the bush.\r\nI can't make out Kanakas. I've read a lot of stuff written about them,\r\nbut there's always something behind that no one can get at. They\r\nare right down good in a lot of ways, and right down bad in others.\r\nMissionaries civilize them and varnish them over, but there's always\r\nthe Kanaka underneath; they make Christians of them, but it's only on\r\nthe outside. Look at that girl--she's only a child, of course, but a\r\nmissionary has had the handling of her, and in the time we've been here\r\nshe has turned right in on herself and gone back to her people, so\r\nto speak. She's not bad, but she's a savage, and nothing will make a\r\nsavage anything else than a savage, except, maybe, on the outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"She seems pretty faithful and helps us all she can,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she's not bad,\" yawned Schumer; \"and she's a good deal of use in\r\nher way, and she's company of a sort, same as a dog or a cat. Well, I'm\r\ngoing to turn in.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose up and stretched himself, and looked at the starlit lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"It's funny to think there's maybe a fortune in pearls under all that,\"\r\nsaid he, \"no knowing--but it will take some getting.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll get it if it's there,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDREDGING\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were up at dawn, and the fire was crackling and the coffee heating\r\nbefore the sun had fully shown itself over the eastern reef line.\r\n\r\nSchumer had been able to salve cooking utensils and some unbroken\r\ncrockery ware from the _Tonga_, to say nothing of knives and forks and\r\nspoons.\r\n\r\nIt seems a small matter, but a knife and a fork make all the difference\r\nwhen one comes to food, even on an island of the Pacific--a plate, too.\r\n\r\nCondemned to eat with one's fingers and to share a knife in common, one\r\nfeeds, but one does not eat.\r\n\r\nThere was condensed milk for the coffee, ship's bread and salt pork\r\nfried over the fire. Isbel had collected some plantains; they went into\r\nthe frying pan to help the pork. She had also gathered some drupes from\r\na pandanus tree growing near the wreck, and served them on a big leaf.\r\n\r\n\"There's a whole lot of seeds aboard somewhere,\" said Schumer, as they\r\nbreakfasted; \"onions and carrots and so on; I must hunt for them, and\r\nwhen we have time I'll see how they grow here. You can grow anything on\r\nthese islands. The soil's the best in the world; maybe because of the\r\ngull guano. We'll want all the native-grown food we can get here, if\r\nthings turn out as I expect, for we'll have to feed the labor we bring,\r\nand natives aren't happy without the stuff they are used to. Corned\r\nbeef and spuds are all very well in their way, but it's breadfruit and\r\ntaro and plantains that are the stand-by. Fortunately there seems lots.\r\nYou see all that dark-green stuff growing over there straight across\r\nthe lagoon--that's breadfruit; big trees, too, and the coconuts aren't\r\nbad.\r\n\r\n\"When we get the labor we'll have a main camp over by the fishing\r\nground. I've been thinking it all out. There's no natural water there,\r\nbut I noticed yesterday a big rain pond in the coral; it must have\r\nbeen cut out by natives some time or another. The funny thing about\r\nthese ponds is that the water is saltish at high tides, but gets fresh\r\nwith the ebb. In some of the islands the natives stock them with fish,\r\nsalt-water fish swimming in fresh.\r\n\r\n\"Then we have the fishing to fall back on, and the lagoon is full. Yes,\r\nwe are not badly placed as things go.\"\r\n\r\nThey placed the dredge on board the boat and some food for the midday\r\nmeal, and pushed off, leaving Isbel behind to look after the camp and\r\nkeep an eye out for ships. At the sight of a sail anywhere on the sea\r\nshe was to light the fire and make a smoke with green wood, and she\r\nhad a splendid lookout post, for the deck of the _Tonga_, onto which\r\nshe could easily climb, gave a complete view of the horizon from all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThen they rowed off, leaving her watching them, a solitary figure on\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\n\"Seems she'll be a bit lonely,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Not she,\" replied Schumer; \"she'll be happy enough alone, and she has\r\nlots to do between washing up and keeping a lookout. Kanakas are never\r\nlonely; it's a disease of civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look upon these people as if they were animals,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Which they are,\" replied Schumer--\"animals dressed in human skin.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd said nothing. He was not a psychologist or a philosopher, but\r\na man of action; yet he gauged something of the strange make-up of\r\nSchumer's mind. Here was a man of keen intelligence, a quoter of\r\nScheffel, an appreciator of beauty, apparently a kindly individual,\r\nbut in some respects apparently hard beyond belief, and in others\r\napparently blind.\r\n\r\nFloyd had some knowledge of the Polynesian natives, he was gaining some\r\nknowledge of Schumer, and he was to gain more knowledge of both--of the\r\ncivilized man and the savage and their respective worth.\r\n\r\nThey got to work in two-fathom water on the northern edge of the great\r\nbed. They stripped for the business. Both men were good swimmers and\r\nexpert divers, and the dredge did its work fairly well. They agreed\r\nto take the diving business in half-hour tricks, one remaining in the\r\nboat with a view to possible sharks, though sharks were scarcely to be\r\nfeared in that part of the lagoon, and to keep the boat moving when the\r\ndredge was in operation.\r\n\r\nFloyd was the first to go down. At a depth of twelve feet it was as\r\nbright almost as at the surface. The water seemed to hold light in\r\nsolution; glancing up, the white-painted boat floating like a balloon\r\nabove him showed a tinge of rose; passing scraps of focus were all\r\nspangled and sparkled over as though powdered with jewel dust; his arm,\r\nnewly immersed, was diamonded by tiny beads of air. In this silent,\r\nbrilliant world of crystal and color one only wanted gills to find life\r\nin perfection and fairyland in material form.\r\n\r\nThere were few fish here, but occasionally a colored phantom would\r\nslow up, pause, and whisk off, fry would pass like a flight of silver\r\nneedles, and great jellyfish quartered like melons and absolutely\r\ninvisible till glimpsed by reflected light.\r\n\r\nAll these things he noticed in his first submersion; after that the\r\nlabor of the business prevented him from noticing anything much except\r\nthe work on hand, cruel and murderously hard work to the man unused\r\nto it. The dredge was almost useless at first; it had to be taken up\r\nand altered, then, as it was dragged along, he followed it, helping\r\nit, picking up loose oysters and putting them in the bag. He could\r\nonly work for less than half a minute at a time, coming up for a two\r\nminutes' breathing spell, and as he worked he could feel now and then\r\nwhat seemed a warm wind trying to blow him aside as the wind blows\r\nthistledown. It was the swell of the incoming tide.\r\n\r\nThey had arranged to work in half-hour tricks, but they found this\r\nabsolutely impossible; before the end of the first twenty minutes Floyd\r\nconfessed himself beaten and Schumer took his place.\r\n\r\nAn hour before noon they knocked off. They had taken a large quantity\r\nof oysters, despite the limited means at their disposal, enough to sink\r\nthe boat a strake or two and give them an hour's work in unloading and\r\nspreading their catch on the coral on the windward side of the reef.\r\n\r\nThen they took three hours' rest under the shade of the trees. At\r\nsundown they had completed their day's work, and they felt as though\r\nthey had been laboring for fifty years.\r\n\r\nThey had overdone it.\r\n\r\nThough they had dived as little as possible during the second half of\r\nthe day's work, using the dredge as much as they could, the work had\r\nnearly broken them, owing to the sudden and tremendous strain put on\r\ntheir lungs.\r\n\r\nSchumer recognized the reason of their exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\"We should have broken ourselves to it by degrees,\" said he--\"done a\r\ncouple of hours' work instead of a whole day's. We are fools. We didn't\r\nwant to strip the lagoon; we were only after a sample, and could have\r\ntaken a week over it. Well, we can take things easy to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThey rowed back to the camp and found Isbel waiting for them, and\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nThey had come back in low spirits, but after supper and a cup of coffee\r\nthe surprising thing happened--their spirits jumped up as though under\r\nthe influence of alcohol. Prolonged strain in diving produces these\r\nresults--the tissues that have been starved or partly starved of oxygen\r\nreabsorb it with renewed vigor.\r\n\r\nThey lay on the sand and smoked and talked, and Floyd built castles and\r\nfurnished them with his prospective fortune.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said he, \"we strike it rich--very rich--what may we net out\r\nof this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It all depends,\" said Schumer, \"if this is a real pearl lagoon;\r\nanything up to a hundred thousand, and maybe more. Pearls are a\r\ndisease, and the disease is more prevalent in some waters than others.\r\nI don't know why, no one does. It may be the temperature or the stuff\r\nthe water holds in solution, it may be the breed of the oyster; but\r\nthere you have it. Every oyster under the sun is a pearl oyster, at\r\nleast may be capable of growing pearls. I found a pearl once in an\r\noyster which I was eating in a restaurant in Hamburg. It wasn't a big\r\npearl, but it was a pearl. I sold it for thirty marks. But one thing\r\nis sure, it's only in tropical and subtropical waters that you find\r\npearls of any account or to any account. It's only in the tropics and\r\nsubtropics you find color and stuff that's rich and worth having. The\r\nnorth--pah! What does it give us? Iron and tin, wood, copper. It's the\r\nsouth where the gold is, where the pearls are. Why, the very earth\r\nin the south hides color and riches! Where are the diamond mines? In\r\nAfrica and Brazil. The ruby and emerald mines? In Burma and Brazil and\r\nIndia. The gold? California and Africa. The silver? Peru. Look at the\r\nbirds; there's not a colored bird in the north that hasn't come from\r\nthe south; look at the shells and the corals, and the flowers and the\r\npeople; look at the sun. No, the south holds everything worth having\r\nor seeing. You ask me what I would do if I were rich? Well, I would\r\nnot go north, or only for a while. I'd stay in the south, fix my home\r\nsomewhere not too close to the equator, take an island in these seas,\r\nand have it for my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you buy islands?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can buy land; one might buy a small island from some of the\r\ngovernments, or rent it; but I'd sooner have the most land in a big\r\nisland than the whole of a little one. Once you have got your grip on\r\nland you have power. Nothing else gives you so much power; funny,\r\nthat, isn't it? Money, you would say, gives power. It only gives the\r\npower to buy or to meddle in other people's affairs through paid\r\nagents. If you have got your grip on the earth, and the things that\r\ncome out of it, and the people who live on it, you have power; and\r\npower is the only thing worth having in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said Floyd. \"There's a lot of things I'd sooner have.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what things may those be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I want to have a good time and see other people having a good\r\ntime. I want to travel, not as the mate of an old hooker like the\r\n_Cormorant_, but as a man with money in his pocket and time to look\r\naround him. I want to be able to buy things. I want to dress decently\r\nand to marry some time or another and settle down. I'm fond of horses,\r\nthough I've never had the chance to own one; and I'm fond of cricket,\r\nthough I've never touched a bat for years. I'm fond of a jolly good\r\ndinner, and I'm fond of a good cigar. To get all those things one wants\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\n\"And all those things come to you if you have power,\" said Schumer.\r\n\"It implies everything material, and much more. It's the sense of it,\r\nthe feeling 'I am the stronger man,' that gives the mind freedom and\r\nease to enjoy what money can bring. You are entirely English; you want\r\nenjoyment and luxury without foundation of strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good heavens!\" said Floyd, \"I think we have a pretty solid\r\nfoundation of strength; we own half the earth, and we hold it--why?\r\nSimply because we live and let live. We don't try to grind people down\r\nwith what you call power. We give them power, liberty, whatever you\r\nlike to call it. Now you are a man who has traveled, and so am I. Can\r\nyou tell me any spot on earth that a man may be really free in that's\r\nnot under the Union Jack or the Stars and Stripes? Take the German\r\ncolonies, the Dutch; haven't you always some pesky official shoving\r\nhis nose into your affairs? Take the very port officers and customs,\r\nand it's the same all through the country as well as on the coast.\r\nYou can't breathe in these places the same as you can where there's\r\na decent English or American administration. I've heard foreigners\r\nwondering how it is we hold India--all those hundreds of millions of\r\nnatives under the rule of a few thousand white men. As a matter of\r\nfact, we don't hold it at all; it holds itself. A native in Bombay is\r\nas free as a duke in Piccadilly; that's our secret.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer laughed.\r\n\r\n\"And at any moment,\" said he, \"those very free natives are ready to\r\nrise in their hundreds of millions and cut your throats.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" said Floyd. \"Men don't cut the throats of their\r\nbest friends.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer yawned.\r\n\r\nTo argue with Schumer was like pressing against India rubber--the\r\npressure left no impression.\r\n\r\nThey talked for a while longer on indifferent subjects, and then turned\r\nin under the shelter of the tent.\r\n\r\nThe night was almost windless, and the great southern stars stood\r\nout like jewels crusting the whole dome of the sky from sea edge to\r\nsea edge. The Milky Way, like a vast band of white smoke cut by the\r\nterrific pit of a coal sack, Canopus, and the Cross, filled the world\r\nwith the mystery of starlight.\r\n\r\nAway out on the weather side of the reef near the wreck, and clear in\r\nthe starlight against the coral, was seated a figure. It was Isbel.\r\nShe had not yet turned into whatever haunt she had in the bush, and\r\nwith her knees drawn up and clasped by her hands she was watching the\r\nregular fall of the breakers.\r\n\r\nThe child seemed under the spell of the vast sea, an atom in face of\r\nthe infinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nRISK OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You can't get pearls from oysters till the oysters are rotten,\" said\r\nSchumer next morning, as they sat after breakfast consulting on the\r\nday's work. \"Of course, you could take every individual fresh oyster\r\nand hunt under its beard; but you know how an oyster sticks to its\r\nshell even after it is opened, and you can fancy the work it would\r\nbe. Once they are decayed they are mushy, and the work is easy though\r\nit's not pleasant. But it's surprising how quick you get used to it.\r\nWe worked pretty hard yesterday, and I propose to take it easy this\r\nmorning, and then a bit later on I want to have a regular overhaul of\r\nthe saloon and trade room of the old _Tonga_. We have cleared the way\r\npretty well, but I've been so busy catching stores in the bush that\r\nI've never had time for an overhaul. You see there was only Isbel and\r\nme to do the job. I expect the oysters we laid out yesterday will be\r\nfit to work on to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've done this pearl business before,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nSchumer laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I have helped in pearling, if that's what you mean, but I have never\r\nhad any luck. I once had my hand on a fortune in pearls, but it did not\r\ncome off.\r\n\r\n\"There was a French island in these seas, no matter where--it wasn't\r\na thousand miles from the Marquesas. It was a double lagoon island,\r\nshaped like an hourglass; no use to look at, not enough trees to give\r\nany amount of copra. It had done a little business in sandalwood in\r\nthe old days, but that was all gone. But the place wasn't deserted.\r\nThere was an old Frenchman in charge; he had rented it under the French\r\ngovernment, and he lived there with his two sons, and seemed happy\r\nenough, though doing next to no trade.\r\n\r\n\"I was in the outer lagoon twice as supercargo of a trading schooner;\r\nonce we put in for water, and the second time we called on the chance\r\nof picking up a little copra. Lefarge was the old man's name, and he\r\nwas a great fisherman; said he lived there mostly for the fishing and\r\nto have an easy life.\r\n\r\n\"Yet somehow he struck me as a man who would not be content to spend\r\nhis time fishing and sitting in the sun, and his two boys struck me the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\"When I wanted to explore the island and get round by the reef to the\r\nmain lagoon he said that was forbidden, the natives held it taboo to\r\nwhite men, and so on.\r\n\r\n\"Then I began to suspect, and the only one thing I could suspect was\r\nshell, and maybe pearls.\r\n\r\n\"The more I thought of it the more sure I was; but, of course, I could\r\ndo nothing; the place was his, and whatever it held, and we were\r\npeaceful traders, not pirates. So, when we had loaded with all the\r\ncopra he could give us, out we put, wishing him good health and good\r\nluck in his fishing.\r\n\r\n\"Two days from the island we met a mail brigantine, and she signaled\r\nus that war had been declared between France and Germany, and our\r\ncaptain--Max Schuster was his name--began to swear, for we were bound\r\nfor the Marquesas, which are French, and we'd have to alter our course\r\nand lose consignments and trade, and he sat down on a mooring bit, and\r\ncursed war and the French till I took him by the arm and led him down\r\nthe saloon and explained what was in my mind.\r\n\r\n\"I told him of my suspicions about the island, and he pricked up his\r\nears. Then, when I had been talking to him about ten minutes and\r\nexplaining and arguing, he suddenly took fire.\r\n\r\n\"It's surprising how a dull man will refuse to be convinced--_won't_\r\nsee, till all at once, when he does see, he'll rush at what you show\r\nhim harder than the best.\r\n\r\n\"Schuster, when he saw fully the advantage of his position, little\r\nrisk, and everything to gain, rushed up on deck. In less than five\r\nminutes the schooner was showing her tail to the Marquesas and making a\r\nlong board for the island.\r\n\r\n\"Our crew were mostly Swedes, Kanakas, and an Irishman, and when they\r\nheard the news that Schuster had to tell them they were his to a man.\r\nThe French were not much in favor just then; they had Noumea tacked\r\non to their name, and the ordinary sailor loves a bit of a fight or\r\nany break in the monotony of sea life. We had plenty of trade rifles,\r\nAlbinis--not the best sort of rifle, but good enough for us--and plenty\r\nof ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"We lifted the island at dawn on the second day, and were anchored in\r\nthe lagoon a few hours later.\r\n\r\n\"Old Lefarge was on the beach tinkering a canoe. He didn't seem\r\nsurprised to see us come in with the German flag flying at the peak,\r\nnor did his sons, who came out of the frame house set back among the\r\nbushes. They thought we had sickness or something on board, for they\r\nmade no offer to put out to us. We lowered a boat on the port side,\r\nwhich was the side away from the beach, and got our men in and the\r\nrifles, and then rowed ashore.\r\n\r\n\"When they saw us landing they took fright, but our men covered them\r\nwith their rifles, and Schuster and I came up to the old man and his\r\nsons and told them that war was declared, and that they were prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"They could do nothing, and they just gave in. We had them taken on\r\nboard the schooner, and then we went to the frame house, and there,\r\nsure enough, in a big safe, were the pearls. We had searched the\r\nprisoners and taken their keys from them. The key of the safe was among\r\nthem, and we opened it easily. There were twenty thousand pounds' worth\r\nof pearls, so we judged.\r\n\r\n\"Schuster was a man who always held tight by the law. I pointed out to\r\nhim that since we were at war with France all French property belonged\r\nto us by rights, and that the best thing we could do was to land the\r\nprisoners and take the pearls. We did not want prisoners. I pointed\r\nout to him, also, that we were acting in the nature of privateers, but\r\nwithout a letter of marque, and that consequently our prize would go to\r\nthe government, and we would get nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I pointed out that since this was French property it would be much\r\nbetter just to take it and be thankful, and say nothing. He said that\r\nwould be piracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it would,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe it would; but what is war if not piracy legalized? You\r\nhave a letter of marque and you are a privateer, you have none and you\r\nare a pirate.\"\r\n\r\n\"But even privateering has ceased,\" objected Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, \"if it has it ought to be renewed in war time;\r\nit breeds fine men, as you English ought to know, and it's every\r\nbit as legitimate as fighting behind naval guns. However, Schuster\r\nthought different about our case. He said he would take the whole lot,\r\nprisoners and pearls, to the nearest German island, and claim a share\r\nof the proceeds, and be within the law.\r\n\r\n\"So off we set, and it took us nearly three weeks to reach the island\r\nwe were in search of, between head winds and calms. When we got there\r\nit was getting on for night, so we held off and on till morning, and\r\nwhen the pilot came aboard we gave him news of the war, and several\r\ncanoes that had put out shot back to land with it; so that when we\r\nentered the harbor the place was decked with flags, and we were cheered\r\nright from the harbor mouth to the quay.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer paused for a light, and went on:\r\n\r\n\"We landed our prisoners and the pearls, and the governor had laid a\r\nbig spread for us, baked pig and lager beer, and so on, and Schuster\r\nwas in the middle of a speech when the sound of a gun brought us all\r\nout on the beach, and there, entering the harbor, was the German\r\ncruiser of the station.\r\n\r\n\"The captain landed and asked us what we were doing with the flags, and\r\nwhen we explained he told us that there was no war, only a lying rumor.\r\nHe had the latest European news from San Francisco, and he gave it to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"It was worth going through the whole of that business to see\r\nSchuster's face. He said nothing, and the governor said nothing, and\r\nit was fortunate they held their tongues, for the cruiser only waited\r\nfour hours to water and put off again.\r\n\r\n\"When she had gone the governor bundled old Lefarge and his sons on\r\nboard our schooner and the pearls, and he gave us orders to take them\r\nback to their island and dump them there, and he sent an armed guard\r\nto see that it was done. He judged, and judged rightly, that Lefarge\r\nwould make no trouble afterward, simply because he would not want to\r\nadvertise the existence of his island. He made them a present of a few\r\ncases of California champagne and some cigars, and old Lefarge was so\r\nglad to be out of the business and get back his pearls that he insisted\r\non opening the champagne, and Schuster brought out some trade gin, and\r\nthey all got drunk.\r\n\r\n\"There was a big moon that night, and they enjoyed themselves, Lefarge\r\nsinging 'Deutschland, Deutschland über alles,' and the governor the\r\n'Marseillaise.'\r\n\r\n\"Then they started fighting, and then they got sick.\r\n\r\n\"Men are strange things, once they let themselves go, and they are all\r\npretty much alike when they are drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You took them back to their island?\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and then we had to return and bring back the armed guard.\r\nSchuster lost nearly two months over the business, to say nothing of\r\nthe provisions and loss of trade. He said he wanted to sink the mail\r\nbrigantine that had given us the lie; but you can't sink a ship by\r\nwanting to. Well, let's get to work.\"\r\n\r\nThey rose up and crossed the coral to the wreck. She was lying at a\r\nslant that made it just possible to walk her decks without holding on\r\nto anything; her copper was already dull green, and the barnacles,\r\nlong dead, showed up like bosses on the copper green like it, as\r\nthough the verdigris had invaded them. The sun had boiled out the pitch\r\nof the planking, and the decks were warping, the planks bursting up\r\nfrom the dowels.\r\n\r\nThe great \"dunch\" she had received from the coral in beaching\r\nhad shaken everything loose; the bowsprit had sprung up from the\r\nknightheads; all forward of the great breach in her side the planking\r\nwas loosened from the ribs, and only wanted another storm to break away\r\nand give the sea a clean sweep of the interior of the hull.\r\n\r\nBut leaving aside the ravages of the sea, the work of ruin was going\r\nsteadily on under the influence of weather and sun. A ship out of water\r\nis dead, and death means corruption. On the reefs and beaches of the\r\nocean you will see wrecks, carcasses of ships, skeletons with the blue\r\nsky showing through their ribs. They have been eaten by the weather\r\nmore than by the sea.\r\n\r\nThey reached the deck of the _Tonga_, and made their way down the\r\ncompanionway to the main cabin.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of light through the broken sides of the vessel, and\r\nthe sunshine from the outside world showed up the interior and was\r\nreflected by the varnished pine paneling and by a strip of mirror still\r\nabsolutely intact. The table in the center was still standing, and\r\nabove it the swinging lamp all askew, an empty bird cage lay in one\r\ncorner, and all sorts of raffle littered the floor.\r\n\r\nThe captain and chief mate's cabin lay aft, and Schumer, opening the\r\ndoors and fixing them so, began a thorough overhaul of the contents.\r\nHe had already salved the ship's money and papers, the nautical\r\ninstruments, charts, and books; what remained was mostly private\r\nproperty, and there was not very much of it. Some clothes, underwear,\r\nand boots and shoes made up the pile, together with native curios,\r\ncheap novels, some writing materials, and two revolvers with ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"It'll all come in handy some time or another,\" said Schumer, \"and I\r\npropose that we stuff the lot back into the old man's cabin; they'll be\r\nas safe there as anywhere, unless another big storm comes and makes a\r\nclean sweep of everything. Now let's have another go at the cargo.\"\r\n\r\nThey had no need to enter the hold by the main hatch. The damaged side\r\ngave them ample means of entry. The confusion was appalling.\r\n\r\nSchumer had already salved a quantity of canned stuff. Unable to move\r\nthe boxes and crates, he had broken them open with an ax and removed\r\nthe contents piecemeal; but, having only Isbel to help, and no very\r\nurgent incentive to the work, he had done comparatively little. Now,\r\nwith the prospect of remaining on the island and the necessity of\r\nfeeding possible labor when the time came for working the lagoon, it\r\nwas a different matter.\r\n\r\nFloyd, however, did not see it in the same light as Schumer, and when,\r\nafter an hour's work carrying stuff across the coral, they knocked off\r\nfor a rest, he put his ideas before the other.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said he, \"it's all very well breaking our backs over this\r\nbusiness, but we haven't got the labor to feed yet; we'll have to go\r\nto Sydney or 'Frisco to get the money raised, and it may be six months\r\nafter we are taken from here before we can get back, maybe longer.\r\nThen the chap that finances this business will do the provisioning of\r\nthe expedition. I don't see the point in harvesting this stuff under\r\nthe trees, especially as it's safe enough in the wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here,\" said Schumer, \"if you are not prepared for everything\r\nin this world you never get anywhere. You say the stuff is safe enough\r\non the wreck; I say it isn't. First, there's the heat of the sun, which\r\ndoesn't improve it. Secondly, there's the chance of a hurricane making\r\na clean sweep of everything. The tail end of a big storm landed her\r\nwhere she is; the front end of another may finish her. You say that it\r\nmay take us six months or more before we can start on our business--who\r\nknows? Who knows that a likely ship may not call here with some man in\r\ncharge of her who would join us in the venture? I would sooner have\r\na decent shipowner in it than some American or Australian financier.\r\nYou never know what may occur, and here is a lot of stuff that may\r\nsave the situation when the time comes. No, we have got to get it\r\nsafe, and get it safe we will, not only provisions, but as much of the\r\ntrade as we can manage. It's all money, and you can do nothing without\r\nmoney, either in these seas or in Europe. So we'll just stick to this\r\nbusiness, and we'll cover the cached lots over with sailcloth--we\r\nhave lots of that. We had better stick to it for a week right on and\r\nget it over. I've been thinking about it ever since this morning, and\r\nsomething tells me that we'd be fools to bother about the lagoon, which\r\nis safe as a bank, while the stuff that will help to raid that bank is\r\nin danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose there are no pearls in those oysters of any account?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's always the shell,\" replied Schumer, \"and there are sure to be\r\npearls. You are of the disbelieving sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit--only--well, perhaps you are right. I'm not going to shirk\r\nany work that may be useful--and when do you propose to examine those\r\noysters we fetched up yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll leave them a week,\" said Schumer; \"the longer they are left the\r\nmore rotten they'll be, and the easier to work. Besides, if we found\r\nno pearls, it would take the heart out of us, and, more than that,\r\nthe hope of finding pearls when we do go will put the heart into us.\r\nNothing is better to make one work than a pleasant prospect not quite\r\nassured in front of one. It's the gambling instinct--a big instinct.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd laughed. There was something about the man Schumer that held\r\nhim more and more and compelled belief and the admiration that all\r\nmen have for strength and foresight. Schumer did a lot of thinking as\r\nwell as working. He had said nothing up to this moment of abandoning\r\nthe oyster business for a week and putting all their energies into\r\nthe salving of provisions and trade--he had been thinking out the\r\nwhole plan in silence. He disliked the labor of the salvage business\r\nas much as Floyd, but he imposed it on himself as means to a distant\r\nend, and Floyd, though he did not see the end in the same light as his\r\ncompanion, was not the man to hold back when another was working.\r\n\r\n\"I am with you,\" said he. \"It will give us exercise, anyhow, and it's\r\nbetter than diving. Come on and let's get at it.\"\r\n\r\nHe revenged himself by outvying Schumer in energy. They worked stripped\r\nto the waist.\r\n\r\nThey had set themselves a herculean task. It was not only a question\r\nof conveying small goods piecemeal in extemporized baskets; it was a\r\nbusiness also of carrying heavy stuff, bolts of cotton, and so forth\r\nthat could not be divided up.\r\n\r\nThere was not only the conveying to be done, but the storing. In this\r\nnature helped them. The reef, or, rather, the island that formed this\r\npart of the atoll had a big sink in it amid the grove at the back of\r\ntheir encampment. Schumer thought that in ancient days natives must\r\nhave made this hollow by artificial means for some reason or other,\r\npossibly as a big rain pond, though that supposition seemed negatived\r\nby the existence of the natural well that lay in the western border\r\nof the grove. However, it had been formed there. It was almost a pit,\r\na hundred yards long, shelving toward the ends and densely protected\r\nby trees to seaward. Schumer calculated that owing to this density of\r\nvegetation and the fact of the ends having drainage into the lagoon,\r\nthis trench would not fill up, let the rain come heavy as it might. On\r\nthe fact that the waves from the heaviest sea could not reach it he was\r\nassured by the configuration of the outside reef.\r\n\r\nHe had fixed on a week's work, and at the end of that time, though they\r\nhad done much, they had not done all; still, he seemed satisfied, as\r\nwell he might be.\r\n\r\nThey had cached all the provisions, they had salved a fair portion of\r\nthe perishable trade, and covered this portion of the salvage with\r\nsailcloth, and of all their work this was the most laborious and\r\ntrying. They had removed the rifles, fifty in number, from their cases,\r\nand stored them with the ammunition in a separate cache; they had\r\nfour navy revolvers of the Colt type, and these with the ammunition\r\nfor them they kept in the tent. Last, but not least, there was the\r\nliquor--cases of trade gin, and a few cases of wine.\r\n\r\nSchumer did not bother to cache these--he dealt with them in another\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n\"It's waste of money,\" said he, \"but I have been thinking it out. This\r\nsquare face is no use to man or brute; it's only good to sell, and we\r\nhave no customers for it, and don't want them. It's dangerous stuff to\r\nhave about. The wine is different; there's not much of it, and it may\r\nturn in useful, but the gin has to go.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the cases, and they smashed the bottles, heaving them on\r\nto the raw coral beyond the wreck, so that the glass might not be in\r\nthe way. The air stank with the fumes of the filthy stuff while the\r\nsmashing went on. Isbel helped, the instinct for destruction that lies\r\nin human nature, and especially in children, seemed to have wakened up\r\nin her to its full.\r\n\r\nShe laughed over the work. Floyd had never seen her laugh before,\r\nand as he looked at her shining eyes and flashing teeth it seemed to\r\nhim that despite all the labors of the missionary here was an atom\r\nof fighting and destructive force, useful for good or evil, and only\r\nwaiting on events for its development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK PEARL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning they started for the oyster ground. There had been\r\nstrong winds blowing for the last week and big seas tumbling along the\r\nreef, the spray finding the oysters that they had put out on the coral,\r\notherwise they might not only have rotted, but dried up. As it was,\r\nthey were just in the prime of their horribleness.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" said Floyd, as they set to work. \"This is worse than\r\nsalving cargo--a jolly sight worse even than diving.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get used to it,\" said Schumer, \"and if it's any comfort to you\r\nto know it's worse for me than you, for I have an olfactory sense more\r\nacute than ordinary. Get more to windward of your work. You ought to\r\nknow that as a sailor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word!\" said Floyd, \"these things must have half stunned me;\r\nthey are enough to make one forget one's instincts, even. Go ahead, I\r\nwon't complain.\"\r\n\r\nHe got to windward, and the stiff breeze helped matters considerably.\r\nSchumer had brought a piece of sailcloth, also a canvas bucket, which\r\nthey filled as required from a reef pool near by.\r\n\r\nEvery shell was searched and washed over the canvas, Schumer, with the\r\neye and hand of an expert, doing the manipulation while Floyd poured\r\nthe water in trickles as required.\r\n\r\nDozen by dozen the shells were explored, drained of their mushy\r\ncontents, and flung away. Not a pearl showed.\r\n\r\nFloyd forgot everything in the excitement of the moment. He had no\r\nlonger a sense of smell, and then, as the heap of shells steadily grew\r\nwithout sign or symptom of what they were in search of, his spirits\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n\"Pour away,\" said Schumer; \"this is only the beginning of the business;\r\nthere's no knowing what is to come. Ah, here's something!\"\r\n\r\nHe stood up, poured some water into the palm of his hand, examined what\r\nwas in his palm, and then held out his dripping hand to Floyd.\r\n\r\nIn the palm lay a small black stone about the size of a pea.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Floyd.\r\n\r\nSchumer laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Only a black pearl, worth maybe a hundred dollars. But it's fortune,\r\nall the same. We have struck it! A hundred dollars for half an hour's\r\nwork for two men. It's good!\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the coral, while Floyd, now deeply excited, took his\r\nseat beside him. The gulls cried and wheeled overhead, and the sun\r\nburned on the blue sea and the foam of the reef, and the wind blew the\r\nspray in their faces as they sat handing their treasure from one to the\r\nother, examining it and gloating over it.\r\n\r\nWashed and dried now, its luster appeared. It was a perfect black\r\npearl, not large, but of splendid quality, globular and slightly\r\nflattened on one side.\r\n\r\n\"It's worth more even than I thought at first,\" said Schumer. \"It's a\r\nbeauty. Well, we mustn't chuckle too soon; it may be the only pearl in\r\nthe lagoon, though I don't think so. And the shell is of fine quality;\r\nall the indications are good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought all pearls were white,\" said Floyd. \"Of course, I know\r\nnothing about them, and the only ones I have seen were in shop windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"And most likely false, at that,\" said Schumer. \"No. Pearls are not all\r\nwhite. I don't know what makes the color in them, but there it is. Some\r\nare black like this, and a few are pink, and I've seen some gray--they\r\naren't much good. Pink are the rarest, then come black, then white.\r\nWell, I'll put this fellow in my match box, and now let's get to work\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nHe put the pearl in the match box and the box in the pocket of his\r\ncoat, which he had taken off. Then, having placed a lump of coral on\r\nthe coat to prevent any chance of the wind blowing it about, they\r\nreturned to work.\r\n\r\nThey worked right through the whole take of shell, and the sun was\r\nsetting when they had finished. The result was triumphant.\r\n\r\nTwelve pearls was the harvest, including the black. Four of these were\r\nquite inconsiderable, but of good quality; four more, though larger,\r\nwere not of good shape or quality, but there were three white beauties.\r\nThe largest, Schumer estimated at a thousand dollars and over, the next\r\nlargest at less than a thousand, and the third at five hundred.\r\n\r\nThere were also some seed pearls, tiny things like nits' eggs.\r\n\r\n\"If the whole lagoon pays up like that,\" said Floyd, \"we'll be rich ten\r\ntimes over.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"We can't tell. Nothing is more uncertain than pearling. We are sure\r\nto find blank streaks, and it's possible we may have just struck the\r\nrichest corner. In a lagoon like this a lot depends on the different\r\ntemperatures, the depth, and the rush of the currents. But we've done\r\nwell, and a lot better than I expected.\"\r\n\r\nThey set off back across the lagoon to their camping place, and the\r\nday's take was placed in the box with the ship's money.\r\n\r\nSchumer had suggested to Floyd that the money of the _Cormorant_ should\r\nbe placed with that of the _Tonga_ in the same box, and Floyd had\r\nagreed, seeing the wisdom of centralizing their treasure so that in\r\neventualities it might be more easily protected.\r\n\r\nTogether with the pearls the hoard made now a very respectable show,\r\nthough Floyd had pointed out that the _Cormorant_ money, being Coxon's,\r\nmust not be counted in their mutual assets. Schumer had agreed, though\r\nevidently with reservations. The money of the _Tonga_ was a different\r\nmatter; he seemed to look on it as his own. Never once did he refer\r\nto it in other terms, nor had he told Floyd the name of the _Tonga's_\r\nskipper.\r\n\r\nFloyd did not press the point--it was a matter entirely to do with\r\nSchumer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE WRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night, as they sat by the camp fire they noticed a great confusion\r\namong the gulls.\r\n\r\nThey seemed quarreling all along the western side of the reef. The\r\nvoice of the gulls was one of the familiar sounds of the island, but\r\nnot after dark. To-night they were clamorous.\r\n\r\nThey broke out again before dawn, and Floyd, listening, noticed a new\r\nnote in their voices. They seemed not quarreling one with another, but\r\nagainst some common enemy. Then the sound died away little by little,\r\nand when he came out of the tent there was not a gull to be seen near\r\nthe reef opening, where as a rule they congregated in numbers.\r\n\r\nThe sunrise was clouded, and the sun did not strike the sea till half\r\nan hour later than his ordinary time. The wind that had been blowing so\r\nstrongly yesterday had died away, yet the boom of the surf on the reef\r\nwas louder than on the day before.\r\n\r\nFloyd crossed the reef close to the wreck and looked seaward.\r\n\r\nA glacial calm held the sea, a calm underrun by a tremendous swell. A\r\nlong, tremendous swell, an infinite heaving of the very depths of the\r\nocean finding expression here in acre-wide undulations, solemn, slow\r\nto the eye, rhythmical and sonorous.\r\n\r\nThe beating of the breakers seemed ruled by a metronome.\r\n\r\nThere was no little wave and big wave, no hesitation of the sea. The\r\nbreakers were equidistant and equal in volume, and their pace was set\r\nto the same funeral march.\r\n\r\nSchumer came out of the tent, and, catching sight of Floyd, walked\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\n\"There must be a lot of damp or electricity or something in the air,\"\r\nsaid he. \"I feel like a rag.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at the sea,\" said Floyd; \"there has been a big storm somewhere,\r\nif I am not greatly mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer stood looking at the sea.\r\n\r\nThe sun seemed bright as ever, yet the water did not respond to his\r\nlight; it had at once a surface brilliancy and a dullness in its\r\ndepths. Toward the shore it was bottle green, and even the blue far out\r\nhad a trace of tourmaline.\r\n\r\nSchumer said nothing, and turned away to the camping place, where Isbel\r\nwas making the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go on with the diving to-day?\" asked Floyd, as they\r\nbreakfasted.\r\n\r\n\"I don't feel like work,\" said Schumer; \"besides, I doubt if it would\r\nbe any use. There's a huge, big storm coming, if I am not mistaken.\r\nI feel it in my skin, and I feel it in my nerves. I suppose it's the\r\nelectricity in the air, but I believe I'd spark if you touched me with\r\na bit of metal. Listen! There go the gulls again.\"\r\n\r\nAway on the reef beyond the fishing ground, so far away that their\r\nvoices came indistinctly on the windless air, the gulls were crying\r\nagain, and, standing up, Floyd could see them in wild flight about the\r\nreef like scraps of blown white paper.\r\n\r\nThen they rose higher, continued their argument, and began to recede.\r\n\r\n\"They are off,\" said Floyd; \"going out seaward, the whole lot of them.\r\nBy Jove, that looks like business!\"\r\n\r\n\"They know what's coming,\" said Schumer, \"and they are clearing out of\r\nthe track. Wonder what tells them. Instinct, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nHe set off to examine the cache, taking Floyd with him. He had covered\r\nthe perishable stuff with sailcloth, and he now set to make the\r\nlashings more secure. They worked an hour, and when they came out again\r\nthe sun had lost his brilliancy--a vague mist hid the horizon on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\nIn the northwest this thickness seemed more dense, and the sea, still\r\nglassing in and breaking in rhythmical thunder on the reef, had turned\r\nto the color of lead.\r\n\r\nBut for the noise of the surf the silence was now absolute and complete.\r\n\r\nIt held so till noon, when a wind began to stir the palm tops; a wind\r\nthat seemed to come from nowhere, rocking them and tossing them hither\r\nand thither, making cat's-paws on the lagoon, and flicking at the tent\r\ncanvas like a worrying hand.\r\n\r\nSchumer took down the tent.\r\n\r\nHe had already placed the valuables in a place of safety. He had dug\r\nout a hole beneath one of the trees and buried the cash box containing\r\nthe money and pearls.\r\n\r\n\"You never know,\" he said, \"if it's a cyclone that's coming. Nothing is\r\nsafe above ground. A cyclone would lift an anvil; anyhow, this will be\r\nsafe enough.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour after noon the great storm showed itself.\r\n\r\nAway above the northwestern horizon a black line appeared, hard and\r\ndistinct as the outline of a country.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to advance--it rose. Till now it assumed the appearance\r\nof a wall. As it rose, it lightened to a dark copper color, and as it\r\nrose it lengthened, so that now it occupied the whole horizon from east\r\nto west.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of this development was appalling, and the sun, as if\r\nshrinking before the coming attack, paled still more, dimmed as by a\r\npartial eclipse.\r\n\r\nNow the wind came steady and strong, whipping the lagoon and bending\r\nthe foliage, and then all at once dying away again into absolute\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\nIt was in this great pause that they heard a sound never to be\r\nforgotten; less a sound than a vibration--deep and almost musical, like\r\nthe vibration of a great glass rubbed by a wet finger.\r\n\r\nIsbel, who had remained on the reef near the wreck while the two men\r\nhad gone for a moment toward the lagoon edge, called out suddenly, and\r\nthey turned and came toward her.\r\n\r\nEven as they turned, the first blast of the wind struck them, and,\r\nbattling against it, they reached where the girl was crouching,\r\npointing to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea beyond the limit of a mile or so was flat as a board, beaten to\r\na dead level by the coming wind and white as frosted silver.\r\n\r\nThey did not wait to see more; turning, crouching, running as swiftly\r\nas possible, and nearly lifted from their feet, they made for the\r\nshelter of the grove. They heard the coconuts torn from the palms\r\nstriking the sand, and Floyd had a momentary vision of nuts hitting the\r\nlagoon like round shot fired by artillery, and then the whole solid\r\nworld seemed to smash like a ball of glass, as the blaze of lightning\r\nand the concussion of the first peal of thunder shook the island as a\r\ndrum skin is shaken by the stroke of the stick.\r\n\r\nFloyd felt Isbel nestling close to him like a frightened animal, and\r\nhe put his arm round her to protect her. He heard Schumer calling out\r\nsomething, but what he could not tell. The wind had now followed on the\r\nthunder in its fullest force, and it yelled.\r\n\r\nNo earthly sound could be compared to that ceaseless, mad, devilish\r\nyell that seemed the expression of all the ferocity of all the\r\nferocious things that had ever inhabited the earth.\r\n\r\nIt was enmity made vocal. The enmity of the infinite and eternal.\r\n\r\nAnd there was no rain. For a moment Floyd thought that there was no\r\nrain; then, lying on his stomach and crawling a bit forward, he saw the\r\nrain. It was not falling, it was driving across the lagoon in a great\r\nsheet upheld by the wind, and the lightning when it struck again showed\r\nthrough a roof of water.\r\n\r\nThen, the first rush of the wind slackening, the rain, upheld no\r\nlonger, came down with a roar.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a cyclone,\" Schumer shouted to Floyd; \"it's just a storm--the\r\ngrandfather of all storms!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was cut off by the voice of the sea, that had now added\r\nitself to the wind and the thunder.\r\n\r\nThe sea, no longer beaten flat, had risen in its might, and was raiding\r\nthe reef. The sound was like the roar of a railway train in a tunnel.\r\nSomething of the vibration reached them through the ground they were\r\nlying on.\r\n\r\nThey were wet through, but safe. The grove had weathered many a storm;\r\nthe position of the trees and their relationship to the reef rendered\r\nthis spot an impregnable stronghold.\r\n\r\nAway on the opposite side of the lagoon breadfruit trees were being\r\nbroken down, but here not a tree went, though the palms were bending\r\nlike tandem whips and the leaves being torn from the artus.\r\n\r\nAs time passed, the sea began to rise more and more, while the face of\r\nthe wind lost its first edge.\r\n\r\nToward evening the waves were making a clean breach of the reef by\r\nthe wreck, and when dark set in, though the wind had lessened still\r\nmore, the sea had risen in an inverse proportion, and they guessed the\r\nreason. The tide was flooding.\r\n\r\nThen came new sounds. The wreck was going. The bones of the _Tonga_\r\nwere being crunched by the wolves of the sea. They heard the noise of\r\nthe tearing of timber from timber, the roll and rumble of balks awash\r\non the coral, and then, worn out and huddled together under a piece of\r\ncanvas which they dragged from the cache covering, they fell asleep,\r\nsure that the worst of the business was over.\r\n\r\nWhen they awoke, the sun was shining, but the wind was still blowing\r\nhalf a gale. The fury of the storm had been in its first impact, but\r\nthe fury of the sea was now even greater than during the night.\r\n\r\nThe waves were mountainous, and the reef where the wreck had lain was\r\nunapproachable, but the sun made up for everything.\r\n\r\nThey crawled out and sat on the sand, drying themselves in the\r\nsunshine, stiff and chill from the damp, and feeling like people\r\nrecovering from an illness.\r\n\r\n\"That storm has been traveling a great distance,\" said Schumer, \"and\r\nwe got only the butt end of it That's what made it blow out so soon.\r\nA storm is like a man--it has only a certain length of life, and the\r\nfarther it travels the more it loses in size. It doesn't seem to lose\r\nin force, only in _size_.\r\n\r\n\"This big sea shows that a big track of the Pacific has been stirred\r\nup. This sea will travel right down to the Horn, and it will last for\r\ndays here. Look at the lagoon!\"\r\n\r\nThe lagoon was strewn with wreckage, spars and planking and ribs\r\nfloated near the shore, moving as if gently stirred by some giant's\r\nfinger in the wind-whipped water; the reef, as far as they could see,\r\nwas washed free of any trace of the wreck that had lain there the day\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good business we salved the stuff out of her,\" said Floyd.\r\n\"Your business, too, that was, for if I had been left to myself I\r\nwouldn't have troubled.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go and look at the stuff presently,\" said Schumer. \"I believe it\r\nwon't have been hurt by the rain--at least, the perishable stuff--I was\r\ntoo careful about the packing; and the drainage is all right--people\r\nrarely think of that. It doesn't do stuff any harm to be rained on if\r\nit is properly covered; what does matter is soaking. Yes, it's just as\r\nwell we moved in time. Now let us get to work.\"\r\n\r\nA fire was impossible, as there was not a dry stick to be found\r\nanywhere, so they breakfasted on canned meat and biscuit, and then set\r\nto work to examine the cache.\r\n\r\nThere was two feet of water in the cache, all the rest had run off to\r\nthe lagoon by the drainage afforded at the two ends. Schumer had packed\r\nthe perishable goods on top--they were quite unharmed. Having satisfied\r\nthemselves on this point, they returned to the beach and the sea.\r\n\r\nThe wind had fallen still more, but the sea was still furious.\r\n\r\n\"It will be less over there on the reef by the fishing ground,\" said\r\nSchumer, \"and we can begin again with the diving work to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA WEEK'S WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, though the sea still held, the wind had fallen completely,\r\nand the lagoon, protected by the reef, was calm, though heaving\r\nslightly to the impetus from without.\r\n\r\nAll the water close to the reef opening was wreck strewn, a section of\r\ndeck floated like a raft, and they had to exercise care in navigating\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n\"If we had hands enough,\" said Schumer, \"all that stuff might come\r\nin useful to build a house with, or some sort of shanty that would\r\ngive more protection than the tent. We'll want something in the rainy\r\nseason. But there is no use in bothering, we haven't the hands.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the fishing ground they landed and found the heap\r\nof shells they had left scattered and almost vanished.\r\n\r\n\"That will teach us in future,\" said Schumer. \"We must find some means\r\nof protecting the stuff in case of storms; those old rain pools would\r\ndo if we could only drain them, but we can't without labor. It's always\r\nwant of labor that has stopped us. Well, we'll get it some day.\"\r\n\r\nThough no real business could be done on the fishery till more help\r\nwas obtainable, the temptation to work was irresistible.\r\n\r\nThose first pearls were always in their minds. It was humanly\r\nimpossible to rest content with that sample, and refrain from the\r\nattempt to get more, even in face of the exhausting labor of diving and\r\ndredging.\r\n\r\nBut they worked less ambitiously now, and so carefully that the day's\r\ntake of shell did not amount to half the take on the first day. As a\r\nresult they were fresh when they knocked off, instead of being worn out.\r\n\r\nThey left the oysters to rot, and so it went on day by day, till\r\nat the end of the week they knocked off the diving one evening\r\nand contemplated their handiwork. Each day's take had been placed\r\nseparately, and the first day's was now \"ripe,\" to use Schumer's\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"We'll start on it to-morrow,\" said he, \"and go through it slowly so\r\nthat there may be no chance of anything escaping; the dredge wants\r\nmending, too--we'd better do that to-night after supper. Isbel can make\r\nanother pocket for it. I wish we had diving dresses and an air pump,\r\nand when we get the business properly fixed we may be able to obtain\r\nthem; but there's no use in thinking of that now.\"\r\n\r\nThey got into the boat, and Floyd sculled her back, Schumer sitting\r\nin the stern and conning them clear of the floating wreckage near the\r\ncamping place. It grieved Schumer's heart to see all that stuff waste\r\nand ungetable. He was one of the men who can make use of anything\r\nalmost to further or maintain his set purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOONER\r\n\r\n\r\nThey started for the fishing ground next morning immediately after\r\nbreakfast, and set to work at once. They had bad luck for the first\r\nhour, and then, as if popped into their hands by the hand of luck, came\r\na beauty, a perfect white pearl, twice the size of a marrow-fat pea,\r\nmaybe even a little bigger, worth five thousand dollars if a penny--so\r\nSchumer said.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to congratulate themselves and feel their luck. You\r\ncannot feel your luck standing. Schumer lit a pipe and Floyd followed\r\nhis example. They put a bit of seaweed on a shell and the pearl on the\r\nseaweed, and with it in front of them began to speculate and talk.\r\nThey felt now that time was theirs, and Schumer knew, though Floyd was\r\nstill to learn, that the flower of success blooms only on the youngest\r\nshoots, that the joy of striking it rich lives only in perfection\r\nduring the first early days of the stroke, that the fever of life and\r\nthe enchantment of triumph both die down and fade, that the fully\r\ngrasped is nothing to the half grasped.\r\n\r\nTo be given a pearl lagoon by luck and to work it as a hog works a wood\r\nfor truffles would be to act like a hog.\r\n\r\nThe stuff was all there; this and the success of the first day's work\r\nwas ample confirmation of the riches lying under that green water, and\r\nSchumer expatiated on the matter.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't believe it,\" said he, \"but the value of a single pearl\r\ngrows in proportion as you can match it with others exactly like it.\r\nIt takes eighty or a hundred pearls to make a woman's necklace. Eighty\r\nor a hundred pearls like that one would each be worth two or three\r\ntimes what each pearl is worth alone. Even twenty pearls exactly alike\r\nwould be worth much more than if they were different, for they would\r\nform the basis for a collection. You would never dream of the work\r\nthat goes on in the world matching these things. There are men at it\r\nall the time in Paris and London and Amsterdam. A perfect necklace of\r\npearls once formed is always held together; it becomes an individual,\r\nso to speak, and is known to the trade by a name. The women belonging\r\nto the royal families of Europe hold a number of these collections, but\r\nthere are lots of private ones, and every great collection is known and\r\ntabulated. So you see it won't pay us to peddle our stuff out little by\r\nlittle--we must hold all the pearls we get and match them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Floyd, \"one thing we have never settled--our shares\r\nin this business. There's Isbel, too; she has done her bit.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer laughed.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of money to a Kanaka?\" said he. \"We'll give her\r\nsomething, of course, but we need not take her seriously into our\r\ncalculations. Our shares--well, don't you think it's a bit early to\r\ncome to that? All this is a dream in the air at present; it may never\r\ngo farther.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's this way,\" said Floyd, \"I always think it's well to start\r\nout knowing exactly where you are going to, and what you are to\r\nget. When you sign on in a ship you know your pay, and you know the\r\nlatitudes you have got to work in, and you know the time you are to be\r\non the job. I think it would be better here and now to settle up this\r\nbusiness, and I think we ought to go half shares.\"\r\n\r\n\"Half shares?\" said Schumer meditatively.\r\n\r\n\"I have been figuring it out in my head,\" said Floyd. \"What have we\r\neach contributed to the business? I have brought my work and a boat;\r\nnow, without a boat we'd have been done completely, because you can't\r\nreach here by the reef, and we couldn't have discovered the beds\r\nwithout a boat. Then there's my work. You have brought your knowledge\r\nof pearling, and, what is more, all that trade stuff and provisions\r\nfrom the wreck, your energy and enterprise and your work. When I said\r\nhalf shares I did not mean that all the trade and provisions of the\r\n_Tonga_ should not be taken into consideration. I would suggest that\r\nwhen we settle up I should pay you for all that out of my share. Then\r\nthere is the money of the _Tonga_ and the _Cormorant_. While I hold\r\nthat Coxon's money belongs by right to his next of kin, I think what\r\nI have suffered through his relative, Harrod, permits me to use that\r\nmoney to further our speculation, paying it back with interest to the\r\nnext of kin when all is through. So I would be nearly equal to you in\r\nready cash, and the question resolves itself into my boat and work\r\nagainst your work and knowledge of pearling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must point out to you,\" said Schumer, \"that I discovered the beds.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, but without the boat where would you have been? If a\r\nship had come along and you had borrowed a boat to explore the lagoon,\r\nthe whole affair would have been given away. I am not arguing to make a\r\nprofit out of the business at your expense, only to give my full views\r\non the matter.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer sat silent for a minute, and Floyd again noticed that profile,\r\ndaring and predominant, hard and predatory. It was as though the spirit\r\nof a hawk were gazing over the sea through the mask of a man.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Schumer, \"that the boat belonged to Coxon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the _Tonga_?\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nSchumer shifted uneasily; then he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let it be so,\" said he; \"half shares, and you pay for the trade\r\nand provisions; it's early to talk of dividing what we have not got.\r\nStill, as you wish it, I agree.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke without enthusiasm. Then he rose up. They had been sitting on\r\nthe weather side of the reef, with their backs to the lagoon and their\r\nfaces to the sea; the wind had almost died away, and now as they turned\r\nthey saw, away across the lagoon, a thin column of black smoke rising\r\nfrom the camping place through the almost windless air.\r\n\r\n\"It's the signal!\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"A ship!\" cried Schumer.\r\n\r\nHe sheltered his eyes, and Floyd, doing the same, saw the figure of\r\nIsbel moving about near the fire. She was putting fresh brushwood on\r\nthe flames, and even as they looked the smoke increased.\r\n\r\nSchumer picked up the pearl that was still lying in the shell and put\r\nit in his pocket. He glanced at the heaps of shell still untouched.\r\nThere was no time to cast all that back in the lagoon or hide the\r\nevidence of their work; it was necessary to get back at once, and,\r\nreturning to the boat, which was beached on the sand, they shoved off,\r\nFloyd taking the sculls.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the beach, Isbel was there, and helped to run the\r\nboat up.\r\n\r\n\"A ship,\" said she. \"Schooner, I think, away over there.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed across the reef toward the outer sea.\r\n\r\nThe deck of the _Tonga_ had always given them a vantage point and a\r\nlookout station; even without it now, just by standing on the reef\r\nwhere the wreck had been they could see the sail, and Schumer, after a\r\nbrief glance, went off to the tent, which they had reëstablished by the\r\ngrove, and fetched a pair of glasses.\r\n\r\nThrough them she leaped into view, a topsail schooner, with all sail\r\nset, making a long board for the island.\r\n\r\n\"She's coming here, sure,\" said Schumer; \"a hundred and fifty or maybe\r\na hundred and eighty tons I reckon her to be; but it is deceitful at\r\nthis distance. Wonder what she is? Wonder what she's doing down here?\r\nShe may have been blown out of her course by that storm; but she hasn't\r\nlost any sticks. Well, we'll soon see.\"\r\n\r\nThey watched the sail as she grew white as a pearl against the sky. The\r\nsea had lost all trace of the late storm, and there remained only the\r\nundying swell of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what's the matter with her,\" said Floyd, as he took a\r\nspell with the glasses; \"but she seems to be handled by lubbers. Either\r\nthey have not enough men to work the sails, or the officers are fools.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer took the glasses and watched her, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nOne of the coconut trees at the entrance end of the grove stood apart\r\nfrom its fellows; it had been stripped of nuts and pretty well stripped\r\nof leaves by the storm. At the suggestion of Schumer, Floyd, with a\r\nflag tied round his neck like a huge muffler, and with a hammer and\r\nsome nails in his pocket, swarmed up the tree and nailed the flag to\r\nthe wood. The wind was strong enough to make it flutter, and with a\r\nglass aboard the schooner it would be easily visible.\r\n\r\nIt evidently remained unseen, for no answer showed.\r\n\r\n\"She's blind, as well as stupid,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"There's something wrong with her,\" said Schumer, \"and if she comes\r\nblundering into the lagoon she may hit that reef we noticed the other\r\nday on the left of the entrance. We had better get the boat out and\r\nshow her the way in when she gets a bit closer.\"\r\n\r\nThe schooner was two miles from the reef when they began launching the\r\nboat. They rowed out through the break in the reef, and then hoisted\r\nthe sail.\r\n\r\n\"She sees us now,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nA flag had been run up to the peak; it was the Stars and Stripes. Then\r\nit was run down again, then again hoisted.\r\n\r\n\"Crew of lunatics,\" said Schumer, as the American flag went down again\r\nand was replaced by the Union Jack. \"What are they at now?\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem to be a mixed nationality,\" said Floyd, \"and rather\r\nconfused in their mind. Look, she's heaving to!\"\r\n\r\nThe wind shivered out the canvas and the topsails flattened.\r\n\r\nShe was, as Schumer had guessed, a schooner of some hundred and fifty\r\ntons, and well found, to judge by her general appearance, her canvas,\r\nand what they could judge of her sticks.\r\n\r\nAs they came alongside they saw that her decks were crowded with men,\r\nall natives; not a white face showed, and as they boarded her a hubbub\r\nrose such as Floyd had never heard before.\r\n\r\nForty Kanakas, mad with excitement and all trying to explain\r\nthemselves, some in broken English and some in native, produced more\r\nimpression than understanding.\r\n\r\nSchumer took hold of affairs by seizing on a big man whom he judged\r\nwith unerring eye to be in some position of authority. Then he held up\r\nhis fist and yelled: \"Silence!\"\r\n\r\nThe row ceased in a second, and only Schumer's voice was heard:\r\n\r\n\"You talk English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me talk allee right,\" replied the big man. \"Me savvee English me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up and answer my questions! What schooner is this, and where\r\nfrom?\"\r\n\r\n\"She de _Sudden Cross_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Southern Cross_; where from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sydney long time 'go; lass po't in de Sol'mons. Capen, off'cers, all\r\ngone; fish p'ison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fish poisoning, was it? What was your captain's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Capen Watters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Walters, most like,\" said Schumer. \"Well, what are all these men--they\r\naren't the crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some de crew; some labor picked up down de Sol'mons, an' islan's away\r\ndere.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your cargo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Copra, most.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Schumer was talking, Floyd was looking about him at the men on\r\ndeck. There were a dozen Solomon Islanders, some wearing nothing but G\r\nstrings, nearly all with shell rings through their nostrils, and some\r\nwith tobacco pipes stuck in their perforated ear lobes.\r\n\r\nHe thought he had never seen a harder lot of natives than these. The\r\nothers were milder looking.\r\n\r\nSchumer, meanwhile, went on with his inquiries. The name of the big man\r\nwas Mountain Joe; he was bos'n. The schooner, since the loss of her\r\nofficers, had been in a hopeless state, as not a soul on board knew\r\nanything of navigation. There had been four white men--the captain,\r\ntwo mates, and a third man, evidently a trader or labor recruiter--and\r\nthe fish that had done the mischief had been canned salmon; evidently\r\nptomaine poisoning in its most virulent form had attacked the only\r\npeople who had partaken of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Schumer had received all this intelligence, he ordered the boat to\r\nbe streamed astern on a line, and took command of the schooner.\r\n\r\nWithout with your leave or by your leave, he gave his orders no less to\r\nFloyd than to Mountain Joe.\r\n\r\nThe Solomon Islanders and the other natives who had no part in the\r\nworking of the vessel fell apart from the crew, who sprang to the\r\nbraces at the order of their new skipper, the sails took the wind, and\r\nthe _Southern Cross_ began to forge ahead.\r\n\r\nThe wind was favorable for the lagoon opening, and as they neared it\r\nSchumer ordered Floyd forward to con the ship while he himself took the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nAs he steered, he gave his orders to Mountain Joe to get ready with the\r\nanchor. The _Southern Cross_ responded to her helm as a sensitive horse\r\nto the bit, and like a great white cloud she glided over the swell at\r\nthe reef opening, and like a great white swan she floated into the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nThen the wind shook out the sails, and the rumble-tumble of the anchor\r\nchain sounded over the water as she came to in five fathoms, and within\r\na pistol shot of the camping place.\r\n\r\nIsbel was standing on the beach sheltering her eyes with her hand, and\r\nsome of the Kanaka crew, recognizing her as a native, waved and shouted\r\nto her. She waved her hand in reply.\r\n\r\nThe schooner now swinging safely at her anchor, Schumer continued to\r\ngive orders till all of the remaining sail was stowed.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Now, we have her safe and sound,\" said he, \"I propose we go down and\r\nhave a look at the manifest, and so forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You aren't going to land any of these people yet?\" asked Floyd,\r\nfollowing him down the companionway to the saloon.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Schumer; \"and when I do land them it won't be at our\r\ncamping ground. Hello, you nigger!\" this to Mountain Joe, who had\r\nfollowed them down; \"what you doing here? Get on deck or I'll boot you\r\nup the ladder--cheek!\"\r\n\r\nMountain Joe vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Floyd, as he shut the door of the saloon, \"do you\r\nbelieve that yarn of the fish poisoning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" said Schumer; \"I believe the white men were done up. They\r\nwere a hard lot, most likely, and they met their match. There was\r\nfighting on deck, for there was a bullet mark on the wheel, one of the\r\nspokes was injured; not only that, I could tell from the manner of\r\nthose fellows that the big Kanaka was lying. Ah, what's this?\"\r\n\r\nHe went to one of the panels of the saloon by the door. It was split by\r\na bullet.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"It's clear enough,\" replied Floyd, \"there has been fighting down here,\r\ntoo. Devils!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well,\" said Schumer, \"we haven't heard their side of the story\r\nyet. Come on, let us search and see what we can find.\"\r\n\r\nThey entered the biggest cabin opening off the saloon. It was evidently\r\nthe captain's. Here things were in order, the bunk undisturbed, and a\r\nsuit of pajamas neatly folded on the quilt.\r\n\r\n\"Bunk hasn't even been lain on,\" said Schumer, \"and where would a sick\r\nman lie but on his bunk or in it? These Kanakas are fools--soft heads;\r\nthey can't put two and two together, or imagine other people doing it.\r\nNow, let's look for the ship's papers.\"\r\n\r\nThey hunted, but though they discovered the box which evidently had\r\ncontained the papers, sign of papers or money there was none. Neither\r\nwas there sign of the log.\r\n\r\n\"They have done away with them,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Looks so,\" replied Schumer. \"Unless the old man swallowed them before\r\nhe died. Ah, here's a coat of his!\"\r\n\r\nA coat hanging from a peg by the bunk attracted his attention.\r\n\r\nHe examined the pockets, and discovered a number of letters, an\r\nAmerican dollar, a tobacco pouch, and a pipe. He returned the pipe and\r\nthe pouch, and placed the letters in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"We'll examine them later on,\" said he; \"they may give us some news.\r\nNow let's look at this chest and see what it holds.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised the lid of a sea chest standing opposite the bunk, and began\r\nto explore the contents. It contained mostly clothes, boots, some\r\nisland curios, and down in one corner another packet of letters, which\r\nSchumer took possession of.\r\n\r\nOn the inside of the lid was nailed the portrait of a stout woman--the\r\nunfortunate man's wife, perhaps.\r\n\r\nTo Floyd there was something mournful in the sight of these few\r\npossessions--all that was left on earth of a man living a few weeks\r\nago, or maybe a few days ago, and now vanished utterly; done to death,\r\nmost probably, by the savages on deck. But Schumer did not seem at all\r\ndisturbed by any reflections on the matter. With speed but no hurry he\r\nwent through the business, closed the lid, and rose up.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get on deck,\" said he; \"we can overhaul the other cabins later\r\non. I have seen what I wanted to see, and there's no use in leaving\r\nthose fellows on deck too long without attention. I'll have another\r\ntalk with the big Kanaka, and then we'll go ashore and have a council\r\nof war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we let any of these chaps land?\" asked Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet; and when we do we'll land them at the reef by the fishing\r\nground. Looks like Providence, doesn't it? We wanted labor, and it\r\nseems we've got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem a tough crowd,\" said Floyd, as he followed his companion up\r\nthe saloon stairs.\r\n\r\n\"They are,\" said Schumer grimly; \"but they'll be softer when I have\r\ndone with them.\"\r\n\r\nOn deck, the crew and the Solomon Islanders were scattered about,\r\nmostly smoking. Some were seated on the deck; others, leaning over the\r\nbulwark rails, were staring at the shore. There was no sign of disorder\r\nor danger; the unfortunates were too glad to be in a place of safety,\r\nafter their experience of driving about the Pacific without a navigator.\r\n\r\nThe open sea is a terrific place to the Pacific islander when he does\r\nnot know in what part of it he is, and when he is left to his own\r\nresources. Schumer's prompt action in bringing them into the lagoon,\r\nthe way he handled the ship, and the manner in which he had given his\r\norders at once raised him to the position of the man in authority.\r\n\r\nHe ordered the boat, which was still streaming astern, with the rope\r\nheld taut by the outgoing tide, to be hauled alongside, then he told\r\nMountain Joe to get in, and, following him with Floyd, they pushed off\r\nfor the shore.\r\n\r\nWhen they landed, Schumer called to Isbel, who came out of the bushes.\r\nHe told her to look after the big Kanaka and give him some refreshment,\r\nand then, taking Floyd by the arm, he led him over to the windward\r\nside of the reef, and at a point protected by trees from the lagoon\r\nthey sat down.\r\n\r\nSaid Schumer:\r\n\r\n\"When you are starting out on any business everything depends on\r\nwhether you have got a plan to go on _at the start_. A lot of darned\r\nfools blunder along in the businesses they take up without even a plan.\r\nIf they have a plan, it's one that turns up by accident.\r\n\r\n\"Now, here's our position: Luck has sent us a schooner and a certain\r\nquantity of labor. Good management and foresight has given us a lot of\r\ntrade, provisions, and arms; all that will be useless if we don't act\r\nat once on a plan.\r\n\r\n\"If we let those fellows land here, and if they discover the position\r\nof the cache, it's quite on the cards they might try to rush us. They\r\nmustn't touch the ground here; they must be segregated over there at\r\nthe fishing ground. We have a splendid strategical position, with a\r\nsection of the reef impassable, or next to impassable, for if they\r\ntried to come along it they'd have to go so slow we could pick them off\r\nwith our Winchesters.\r\n\r\n\"But that's all meeting trouble halfway. Our policy is to keep them\r\nhappy after putting the fear of God into them.\r\n\r\n\"I shall land them to-night over there, but first of all I am going to\r\nshow them exactly how things stand, and what they may expect if they\r\nmake trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Now come back, and we will have a talk with Mr. Mountain Joe.\"\r\n\r\nThey came back to the tent, where the dusky bos'n was wiping his mouth\r\nwith the back of his hand.\r\n\r\nIsbel, who had been giving him refreshments, was standing by. When she\r\nsaw Floyd and Schumer approaching, she went off toward the tent, and\r\nthe three men found themselves alone.\r\n\r\nOut in the lagoon lay the schooner, the crowd on her deck leaning on\r\nthe bulwark rails, and evidently speculating on what might be going on\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nJoe, who had been seated, rose up, and Schumer, taking his seat on the\r\nsand beside Floyd, ordered the Kanaka to stand before him.\r\n\r\nSchumer, taking a tobacco pouch from his pocket and a book of cigarette\r\npapers, proceeded to roll a cigarette. As he ran the tip of his tongue\r\nalong the gummed edge of the paper he looked up at Joe.\r\n\r\n\"What made you tell that lie,\" said he, \"about the fish poisoning?\"\r\n\r\nJoe started as though some one had made an attempt to strike him.\r\n\r\n\"What fish p'isonin', sah?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't you try any games with me,\" said Schumer, who had lighted\r\nhis cigarette. \"I know all about the affair, and I am going to see\r\njustice done. Your captain was killed, the mates were killed, and the\r\nother white man was done away with and hove overboard. I take it he was\r\nnot a trader, but a labor recruiter. Don't open your mouth to lie, or\r\nI'll put a bullet in it!\"\r\n\r\nHe put his hand in his pocket and drew out a revolver, which he placed\r\non his thigh.\r\n\r\n\"You just hear me through, for I am going to tell you things. To begin\r\nwith, I doubt if you had any hand in the killing. I judge you by your\r\nface. Had you any hand in it? You may speak.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's lips were dry; his tongue could scarcely form the words:\r\n\r\n\"No, sah, it was not me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was some of those Solomon Islanders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which was the one that did it? There's always one that takes the lead.\"\r\n\r\nJoe was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Which was the one that did it?\" asked Schumer again, without the least\r\nchange in his voice, but with his hand now on the butt of the revolver.\r\n\r\n\"De big one, sah, wid de woolly head an' eyes so.\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to squint.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that chap! I noticed him, and I took his measure.\"\r\n\r\nThen, little by little, he drew out the whole story. It had been a bad\r\nvoyage for the _Southern Cross_. They had been recruiting down in the\r\nSolomon Islands, and the recruiter, Markham by name, had been nearly\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nHe had adopted the usual methods, landing on the beach with a box\r\nof trade goods and without any weapons, while a covering boat hung\r\noffshore to protect him in case of attack.\r\n\r\nThe natives had seemed friendly, but all at once they had drawn off,\r\nscattering toward the bush, from where next moment had come a flight of\r\ntheir deadly spears, one of which had pierced Markham's arm. With the\r\nspear still in his arm, he had managed to get off, and under protection\r\nof the fire from the covering boat had succeeded in reaching the\r\nschooner. The spear had been cut out, or, rather, cut off at the barb\r\nand drawn out, but the wound had bothered him a lot.\r\n\r\nThe thirty natives he had managed to secure before the business\r\nsuffered a good bit at his hand in return for it. The captain and the\r\nmates had not been behindhand; some of the crew had run away, and\r\nthe schooner was shorthanded; that did not add to their good temper.\r\nThey tried to make the Solomon Islanders help in the working of the\r\nvessel, but these gentry had not engaged themselves for ship work, but\r\nplantation work, and they said so. The captain had booted some of them\r\nand threatened to shoot others, and generally the schooner seemed to\r\nhave been a hard ship. There seemed the distinct evidence of a trail\r\nof drink over the whole business, and the upshot was death for the\r\nafterguard.\r\n\r\nDeath dealt with belaying pins and an ax wielded by the woolly-headed\r\nindividual with the squint.\r\n\r\nTwo natives had been shot dead on the spot, one had been wounded,\r\nand had died of his wounds. Then the decks had been swabbed, and the\r\nprecious crew, without a navigating officer or the faintest notion of\r\ntheir exact position, had made sail, or, rather, made a fair wind that\r\nwas blowing, trusting to chance to take them somewhere.\r\n\r\nThey had touched the skirt of the big storm, but they managed to\r\nweather it, and, seeing the island in sight, had made for it.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, \"I believe you have been telling me the truth. I\r\nam here to do justice, and justice shall be done.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose up, and drawing Floyd aside, walked a few paces with him along\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\n\"That fellow with the squint was evidently the leader in this\r\nbusiness,\" said he. \"I am not thinking so much of the trouble on\r\nboard the schooner, for it's pretty evident that the old man and the\r\nmates and the recruiter deserved their gruel. What I am thinking of is\r\nthe time before us. I am going to make these chaps work the fishery,\r\nand I don't want a potential murder leader among them. That wouldn't\r\ndo at all. Besides, they must be shown at once their position in the\r\nscheme of things, and that position is laborers working for decent pay,\r\nbut under a strong hand. Besides, all these fellows have murder on\r\ntheir conscience--or the thing, whatever it is, that serves for their\r\nconscience. That will always make them nervous and distrustful of white\r\nmen. I can't clear their consciences, but I can clear their minds of\r\nthe fear of consequences, and I am going to do it now.\r\n\r\n\"You have your revolver in your pocket; get your rifle, also, and come\r\nwith me. We may have to fight; there's no knowing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't mind if we have,\" said Floyd; \"rotten murderers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they are all right! They are only savages, doing according to\r\ntheir lights. They only require firmness to do according to the lights\r\nof civilization.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the tent with Floyd, and they got their rifles and some\r\nextra ammunition. Then, with the help of Joe, they pushed the boat off.\r\n\r\nThe fellows on board watched the coming of the boat, evidently\r\nsuspecting nothing, though they must have seen the rifles.\r\n\r\nSchumer was the first to come on board, followed by Floyd.\r\n\r\nThey walked aft, and Joe, when he had finished securing the boat,\r\nfollowed them.\r\n\r\nSchumer sent him below for two deck chairs which he had seen in the\r\nsaloon; they were placed close to the wheel, and the white men, taking\r\ntheir seats, and with the rifles across their knees, Schumer threw his\r\nold panama hat on the deck about fifteen paces away from where he was\r\nsitting, and ordered all hands aft for a palaver.\r\n\r\nNo man was to take a step beyond the hat.\r\n\r\nThey came up, some of them still smoking, some chewing, and all\r\nevidently wondering what was up, and what the bearded white man with\r\nthe fixed, determined face had to say to them.\r\n\r\nThough he could speak in the dialect of the Solomons, he made Joe his\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\nHe asked the labor hands first what wages the recruiter had promised\r\nthem for plantation work.\r\n\r\nThey were very explicit on this point. They were each to receive in\r\ntrade goods, tobacco, knives, and so forth what would be the equivalent\r\nof about seven pounds a year. They were, of course, to be fed and\r\nlooked after.\r\n\r\nSchumer, taking a pencil and a piece of paper from his pocket, made\r\ncalculations. Then he addressed them through Joe. He said that he and\r\nFloyd were owners of this island, which was a very pleasant place, as\r\nthey could see for themselves, with plenty of food, both grown here and\r\nbrought to them regularly by a ship, which they also owned.\r\n\r\nTo allow this to sink into their intelligence, he proceeded to roll a\r\ncigarette; when he had lit it, he went on.\r\n\r\nHe would offer them work here, and a happy life, and a return home\r\nat the end of a year, if they desired to return. The work was very\r\neasy, and play, compared to plantation work; it was simply diving for\r\nshellfish. They could all dive?\r\n\r\nA flashing of white teeth answered this question in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nHe would pay them exactly the same wages as that offered for plantation\r\nwork; each man would have to collect so much shell--the amount would be\r\nfixed later--and for all shell collected over and above the stipulated\r\namount, a bonus would be paid in tobacco or whatever they liked.\r\n\r\nThe bonus business had to be explained to them, and the idea took hold\r\nupon their imaginations at once.\r\n\r\nThey agreed to everything. The island pleased them; there was evidence\r\nof what Schumer had stated all round--plenty of trees, fruit, and in\r\nthe lagoon fish. It seemed to them that they had dropped on their\r\nfeet at last. They broke up into little groups and chattered over the\r\nbusiness while Schumer sat watching them with a brooding eye.\r\n\r\nAny other man, one might fancy, would have been more than satisfied by\r\nthe success which had apparently met his offer. In reality, he had only\r\nbegun what he had set out to do.\r\n\r\nWhen they had talked together long enough, he gave orders to Joe, and\r\nthey were lined up again. Asked if they agreed to the terms offered to\r\nthem, they replied, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThen Schumer, throwing the end of his cigarette away, crossing his\r\nknees, and nursing the rifle lying across his lap, began speaking to\r\nthem in their own dialect without the aid of Joe.\r\n\r\nHe talked to the Solomon Islanders, but the others quite understood his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that from what he had seen below stairs, he knew for a\r\nfact that the captain of the _Southern Cross_ and the other white men\r\nhad not died from fish poisoning, but from blows. He told them that\r\nan English man-of-war was cruising in the neighborhood of the island,\r\nand that if she caught them they would undoubtedly be hanged to a man;\r\nhe gave them a pantomime with his hand at his throat to help their\r\nimaginations, and, seeing the effect produced, at once started on a new\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThey had nothing to fear if they trusted in him and in the white man\r\nbeside him, but justice must be done. It was impossible for white men\r\nto allow other white men to be murdered or killed without bringing the\r\nmurderers to book.\r\n\r\nHe did not believe that they were all implicated, but he did believe\r\nthat there was one among their number who had led them to this act.\r\n\r\nDead silence among the audience, whose faces laughing a moment ago,\r\nwere now a picture representing all the emotions that range between\r\nfurtiveness and fright.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Schumer, still speaking in the native, \"if you will\r\nnot speak it will be the worse for you. I am not your enemy. I am your\r\nfriend, and am able to protect you all from the consequences of what\r\nhas been done; but I will not do so unless I can punish the man who was\r\nchief in this business. You will not show him to me; well, then, I will\r\nfind him for myself, for I have been born with the means of knowing\r\nmen, and I can see their thoughts, just as you can see the fish that\r\nswim in the lagoon.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose from his seat and walked toward where they were standing. The\r\nline bent back for a moment, as though they were going to break away\r\nand run, then they stood their ground; every eye was fixed on him as he\r\nwent from one to the other, lifting this one's chin with his finger,\r\nresting his hand on that one's head.\r\n\r\nFloyd, still seated, had his rifle ready in case of accidents, but it\r\nwas not needed. The diplomacy of Schumer had made the crowd afraid, not\r\nof him, but of the consequences of their act, and to cap that, they\r\nwere held by the fascination of this business and the curiosity to see\r\nwhat was about to happen.\r\n\r\nWhen Schumer reached the squint-eyed individual he placed his hand on\r\nhis head. Then he snatched it away, as though something had stung him,\r\nand looked at the palm.\r\n\r\n\"You are the man,\" said he. \"Look!\"\r\n\r\nHe held up his palm for a second; there was nothing in it, but every\r\nman in that crowd saw something, according to his imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PUNISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFloyd's finger went to the trigger of the rifle across his knees. He\r\nexpected a sudden attack by the criminal on his accuser, but the man\r\ndid nothing.\r\n\r\nA murmur went up from the crowd, the sort of murmur that would have\r\nfollowed the exhibition of a conjuring trick, while Schumer, taking his\r\nman by the arm, led him apart from the rest and made him stand with his\r\nback to the port bulwarks.\r\n\r\n\"Is what I say true?\" he asked, turning to Joe.\r\n\r\nHe had calculated on everything, and he knew that Joe the informer\r\nwould never, never reveal to the others that his--Schumer's--magic\r\ngift of seeing the truth through men's skulls was a trick based on\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Joe, between the devil and the deep sea, gazed wildly\r\nround him, then he bent his head in assent.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Schumer, then he turned to Floyd. \"You are one of the judges\r\nof this man. I am the other, but I am president of this court, and I\r\nhave the casting vote--pronounce your sentence.\"\r\n\r\n\"He deserves death,\" said Floyd; \"but----\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer to isolate him on some part of the island and hand him\r\nover to the first ship.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer turned to Joe, and, pointing to a whaleboat hanging at the\r\ndavits, ordered it to be lowered.\r\n\r\nWhen it was afloat he gave orders for the whole of the labor men to get\r\ninto it, telling them that all was clear now that the chief offender\r\nwas to be punished, and that no more would be said on the matter, that\r\ntheir work would be paid for on the terms he had named, and that their\r\nfuture lot would be happiness, good pay, good food, and plenty of it.\r\n\r\nThey crowded down into the boat. There were thirty of them, and they\r\nfilled it nearly. Then, leaving Floyd on board with Joe and the Kanaka\r\ncrew and the criminal, he got into the boat and took his place at the\r\ntiller.\r\n\r\nThe Solomanders rowed villainously, but they made the whaleboat move,\r\nand Floyd, with one eye on the murderer, who had now taken his seat\r\non the deck, watched Schumer steering them for the fishing ground and\r\nlanding them on the beach.\r\n\r\nHe landed them, and seemed to be explaining things. Floyd caught\r\nglimpses of him waving his arm about almost as though he were pointing\r\nout the view.\r\n\r\nThen with two of them for oarsmen he came back.\r\n\r\nFloyd, as Schumer came on deck, felt sick at heart. He hated the crime,\r\nand he hated the sight of the criminal, but he hated even more the idea\r\nof death, and he knew that the man now crouched on the deck was surely\r\ngoing to die.\r\n\r\nSchumer, as he came on deck, seemed Fate itself--calm, cold,\r\npassionless Fate. The judge, the hangman, and the rope all in one.\r\n\r\nThe Kanakas seemed to guess it; the very brightness of the day seemed\r\ngrown paler. Floyd walked to the bulwark rail and looked over at the\r\nboat where the two rowers were seated looking up at the vessel. His\r\nlips were dry. He could do nothing; whatever was going to happen was\r\ndeserved, but it was horrible.\r\n\r\nHe heard Schumer giving his orders for signal halyard line and a block.\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ carried a brass cannonade for saluting purposes,\r\nand now he heard Schumer giving orders for it to be loaded.\r\n\r\nI have said that the _Southern Cross_ was a topsail schooner, and at\r\nthis moment the crowd of laborers away out at the fishing ground had\r\ntheir attention drawn by the movement going on upon the rigging of the\r\nforemast; men were swarming up, and a fellow was out on the yard--he\r\nlooked at that distance like a fly against the blue. He came down, as\r\ndid the others, and he had scarcely reached the deck when a white jet\r\nof smoke shot like a plume from the bow of the _Southern Cross_, and\r\nthe noise of a gun came on the wind.\r\n\r\nSomething black and struggling, and just like a spider running up a\r\nthread, went from the deck of the _Southern Cross_ to the yardarm,\r\ntouched it, and then sank some half dozen feet, and swung dangling\r\nagainst the sky. It was the murderer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF SCHUMER\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring it all Floyd had kept his eyes turned away. When the men had\r\ncome running aft with the halyard line they had knocked against him,\r\nmaking him shift his position, and now, with the dead man swinging\r\naloft, he walked over to the weather side, seemingly an impassive\r\nfigure, with his rifle under his arm keeping guard.\r\n\r\nAs he stood looking over the water to the camping place he saw Isbel.\r\nShe had come out on the sands and she was standing with her hand\r\nshading her eyes. She must have been a witness of the whole tragedy,\r\nand she stood, motionless as a figure carved from stone--for a moment.\r\nThen she turned, and just as though something were in pursuit of her,\r\nshe ran, making for the grove, into which she disappeared.\r\n\r\nFloyd swore under his breath. That the girl should have been allowed to\r\nsee such a thing struck him as a monstrous fact. Gentle, kindly, and\r\nwilling she had been, almost unknown to himself, the one bright spot in\r\nhis life on the island. The one human thing to keep life warm. Schumer\r\nhad been a companion who had never grown into anything more than an\r\nacquaintance; Isbel, though he had talked to her as little as he would\r\nhave talked to a dog, had been a friend. He did not understand her at\r\nall; she had lived her own life, thought her own thoughts, and said\r\nlittle; a child living in a child's world of which he knew nothing, but\r\nshe had somehow kept his heart warm, and now she had been allowed to\r\nsee _this_, the doing to death of one of her own people in the broad\r\nlight of day.\r\n\r\nWhat could she know of the justice of the case? He turned to Schumer,\r\nwho had come toward him now that everything was finished, and, taking\r\nhim by the arm, led him to the weather rail; they leaned over the rail\r\nas they talked.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said Floyd, \"that child has seen the whole of this\r\nbusiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"What child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isbel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that? She stood there watching it all, and then she ran off as\r\nif some one were going to kill her. It was brutal to let her see it;\r\ngoodness knows she has stuck to us and done everything for us a mortal\r\ncould do, and now we repay her by letting her see us hanging one of her\r\nown people.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer seemed disturbed and irritated by this news.\r\n\r\n\"One cannot think of everything,\" said he; \"you speak as though you\r\nwere accusing me. Am I to do all the thinking? Well, she has seen what\r\nshe has seen, and it cannot be helped, though I would not have had it\r\nfor a good deal. That girl may be very useful to us yet, and we do not\r\nwant to make an enemy of her. She will brood over this and say nothing,\r\nand then maybe let us have it in the back some time. Well, we cannot\r\nhelp it; we must remedy it somehow. There is no use in talking about\r\nit with the business we have to do before us. First we must bring\r\nstores and some canvas to make tents for those labor men. Come, we will\r\nget the stuff together now and take it to them in the whaleboat; we\r\nwill take two of the crew with us to help to row.\"\r\n\r\nThey rousted out some spare canvas from the sail room of the schooner,\r\nand had it sent into the whaleboat, which was still alongside, with the\r\ntwo Solomon Islanders who had rowed her out sitting on the thwarts and\r\nstaring up at the form dangling overhead.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to fill them with curiosity, nothing more; yet Floyd noticed\r\nthat when Schumer spoke to them they jumped to attention as though they\r\nhad been addressed by some powerful chief. The crew also ran about at\r\nhis least sign, hauled with all their energy, and hung on his words.\r\n\r\nSchumer did not go to the cache for provisions; he opened the\r\nschooner's lazaret. She was well supplied. Though the mutineers had\r\nkilled their officers they had not sacked the provision room and\r\nbroached the liquor as they would have done had they been Europeans.\r\n\r\n\"They were helpless, you see, like a duck with a broken wing,\" said\r\nSchumer. \"Didn't know where they were; didn't know who would catch\r\nthem. Kanakas will drink, but they don't fly to drink like our chaps;\r\nit's not grained in them.\"\r\n\r\nThey made a selection of tins and had them brought on deck and hoisted\r\ninto the boat. Schumer added some sticks of tobacco, and they pushed\r\noff and rowed for the fishing ground.\r\n\r\nThe laborers waiting on the beach helped them to land. They were a very\r\nsubdued lot indeed; the sight of the hanging seemed to have put them\r\nunder a spell as far as the white men were concerned, and they worked\r\nat the unlading of the stores without a word, yet with all their energy.\r\n\r\nWhen the stuff was landed, Schumer began to talk to them. He asked them\r\nto choose a foreman, and, having consulted together for a few minutes,\r\nthey picked out one of their number--a man with a huge shell ring\r\nthrough his nostrils, split ear lobes, and scar marks on his chest and\r\nall down his left arm.\r\n\r\nSru was the name of this individual, and Schumer, as he watched him\r\nstep out from the ranks, regretted the choice. He suspected that\r\nthey had chosen him, not because he was a favorite, but because he\r\nwas feared. This is always bad, because in dealing with a mass of\r\nnatives--and the same holds good for Europeans--authority has most to\r\nfear from the individual. It is the one man who makes the bother, and\r\nthe man who is feared, if he is placed in a position of supremacy, is\r\nmore likely to make trouble than the man who is loved.\r\n\r\nHowever, they had chosen a foreman at Schumer's request, and it\r\nwas not for him to interfere with their choice. He set to and gave\r\nthem directions as to how they were to make their camp, placed the\r\nprovisions and tobacco under charge of the foreman, ordered them to\r\nbe ready for work next morning at sunup, and then returned to the\r\nschooner, leaving the two laborers behind with the others.\r\n\r\nOn board he gave an order for the body to be lowered and cast in the\r\nlagoon, where the sharks were patiently waiting for their prey; then\r\nwith Floyd he returned to the camping ground, rowing themselves across\r\nin the ship's dinghy.\r\n\r\nThey had left on board the whole native crew with Joe to supervise them.\r\n\r\nThey beached the dinghy by the quarter boat, and walked up to the tent.\r\nIsbel was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nSchumer looked round for her, called, received no answer, and then,\r\nwith his own hands, prepared to light the fire and make the supper.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now low down over the western roof, and the lagoon was\r\nfilling with gold; the schooner, freed from the horror dangling at her\r\nyardarm, lay with her anchor chain taut, and the golden ripples of\r\nthe incoming tide racing past her sides. She made a beautiful picture\r\nwith the sunset light upon her masts and spars, the gulls flying and\r\nflitting about her, crying as they wheeled.\r\n\r\nIt was the time of the full moon, and she rose with the dark. Schumer\r\nhad gone to the tent, where he had placed the letters and papers taken\r\nfrom the captain's coat on board the _Southern Cross_. He returned with\r\nthem in his hand, and, taking his seat by the embers of the fire, he\r\nbegan to examine them.\r\n\r\nHe did not require a lamp; one could have read the smallest print by\r\nthe moonlight now flooding the world.\r\n\r\nIt was a poor enough find. There were half a dozen letters in a woman's\r\nhandwriting, mostly referring to remittances received or expected. The\r\naddresses at the head of them told nothing. \"One hundred and two North\r\nStreet\" was the invariable heading, and for date Monday or Tuesday,\r\nwithout hint of the month in which they were written. \"My dear Joe,\"\r\nthey began, and the ending was always the same, \"Your loving Mary.\"\r\nThere were no envelopes to give a clew to the town they came from or\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\"His loving Mary seemed to have a keen eye for the boodle,\" said\r\nSchumer. \"Ah--what's this?\" He had opened a letter with the printed\r\nheading: \"Hakluyt & Son, Market Street, Sydney.\" The letter ran:\r\n\r\n  DEAR CAPTAIN WALTERS: Owing to Captain Dennison's illness we are\r\n  prepared to offer you the _Southern Cross_, which is now lying in\r\n  harbor. If you will call upon us to-morrow at ten-thirty sharp\r\n  we will be happy to talk over the matter with you and make all\r\n  arrangements.\r\n                                          J. B. for HAKLUYT & SON.\r\n\r\n\"That was written four months ago,\" said Schumer, looking at the date\r\non the envelope. \"They are the owners, and I believe I know Hakluyt\r\n& Son; pair of rogues, as all shipowners are, but they are rich, if\r\nthey are the people I take them for; anyhow it's a good find. We know\r\nthe owners. You see, a schooner is not a thing you can pick up like\r\na purse and put in your pocket. Unless you run her into a port where\r\nthere is no law and sell her for the price of old truck what are you\r\nto do with her? Change her name? Well, what about your papers and\r\nyour log, and how are you going to muzzle your crew, even if they are\r\nKanakas? You have boards of trade and port officers everywhere. It's\r\none of the troubles of civilization, but it has to be faced. Now, on\r\nthe other hand, knowing the owners, we have the law not against us but\r\non our side. The schooner is practically derelict; if we bring her\r\ninto port we can claim compensation. I see a lot of clear sky ahead\r\nin this business if it is properly worked, and we must remember this:\r\nthe fish-poisoning business holds good; there's no use in having\r\ngovernment inquiries, though I don't even dread those; we tried our\r\nman fairly and we hanged him as an example to the others who seemed\r\nmutinous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Floyd. \"I want to say something about that business.\r\nI don't deny that fellow got what he deserved, but there were others\r\nin the business, and there is no doubt at all that they had a lot of\r\nprovocation. But you hanged that man less for what he had done than for\r\nwhat he might do in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly; and to show the others what they might expect, and to show\r\nthem that they have got masters over them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hanged him as a matter of policy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so. As a matter of policy first, and as a matter of punishment\r\nsecond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's where I'm against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Killing for policy's sake. I may be wrong, but it's against my nature\r\nto hang a chap so as to strike terror into others. However, he is\r\nhanged and done with, and there's no use saying any more on the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit,\" said Schumer, going on with the examination of the papers.\r\nThere was nothing else of importance; some receipted bills, some old\r\nletters from chums dated four years back, an envelope with a theater\r\nprogram in it, and another envelope with a faded photograph of a woman\r\nin a low-necked dress, evidently the photograph of some actress that\r\nhad struck Captain Walters' fancy.\r\n\r\n\"It's funny what you find among a man's belongings,\" said Schumer.\r\n\"I've come across a Bible and a pious letter from his mother in the\r\nleavings of one of the biggest blackguards in the world, and I met\r\na man who told me he had gone through the gear of a parson who was\r\nlaid out on a smallpox ship and found books and pictures that weren't\r\nholy. This Walters had an eye for a pretty girl, and sent his wife\r\nremittances pretty often; that's all his remains say of him. I reckon\r\nhe was a poor sort, sentimental, with a taste for the bottle and with\r\nno hold on his crew.\"\r\n\r\nThey put the papers away, and Schumer retired to bed, while Floyd,\r\nrelighting his pipe, strolled over to the ocean side of the reef. At\r\nnight, and especially when the moon was full, this was a place of\r\nterrific loneliness. One heard the voice of the wastes of the sea. He\r\nsat down on a lump of coral and watched the rollers coming in and the\r\nbursting of the foam under the moonlight.\r\n\r\nThe events of the day had depressed him, yet nothing could have shown\r\nbetter results, as regards their plans, than the day's work just\r\nfinished. They wanted labor for the fishery, and labor had appeared\r\non the island as though summoned by a genie. They wanted a ship that\r\nwould make no trouble, and here was a schooner floating in the lagoon,\r\na vessel well found and seaworthy and without eyes or ears to spy on\r\ntheir doings.\r\n\r\nFortune had turned her face toward them and held out her hand, and had\r\nFloyd been listening to the story of himself and Schumer told as a yarn\r\nhis commentary would have been \"Lucky beggars!\"\r\n\r\nThe reality was different, and it disclosed the brutality which attends\r\nsuccess, especially the successful attempt to lift treasure that is in\r\nNature's keeping.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more fascinating than the idea of raiding one of\r\nNature's great banks where she stores her pearls, her diamonds, or her\r\ngold, nothing more trying to all the endurance and good in man than the\r\nprosecution of that great burglary.\r\n\r\nThe hanging business had hit Floyd a hard blow; more than that, the\r\nthought of Schumer was now beginning to threaten his peace like a\r\nphantom.\r\n\r\nThe running away of Isbel at the sight of the hanging had suddenly cast\r\na new light upon Schumer and incidentally upon himself.\r\n\r\nIt was as though Innocence had spoken, condemning them both. And yet\r\nthe man had deserved his fate. Floyd told himself this again and again;\r\nit was the knowledge of this that had prevented him from interfering.\r\nHe told himself that, even as a matter of policy and to protect their\r\nown lives against another outbreak headed by the same leader, the\r\naction was justified.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the phantom remained to disturb his thoughts. Schumer, the\r\nman who had bound himself up so closely in his life, the man whom he\r\ndid not understand in the least, the man whose personality was so\r\npowerful, whose wishes always made themselves good, and whose word was\r\npractically law on that island.\r\n\r\nSchumer was always right; that was part of the origin of his power;\r\nhe had the genius to foresee everything that was coming and the head\r\nto prepare for eventualities. His suggestions were commands based\r\non reason; his orders were worded so as to seem suggestions; his\r\npersonality suffused everything, dominated all things, and made Floyd\r\nfeel at times as though he were an automaton worked by strings instead\r\nof a living man moved by will.\r\n\r\nYet never had Schumer stirred resentment in him.\r\n\r\nThat is the most magical power in a great and dominating personality.\r\nIt does not irritate; it lulls. Your little strong man gets his\r\nwill--if he gets it--by setting everybody by the ears. Your big strong\r\nman works without friction; his men become part of him, his motives\r\npart of them; when they are free to think they may vaguely wonder at\r\ntheir own subservience and even resent it in a way, yet they come under\r\nagain to the will that bends them as surely as the wheat stalks come\r\nunder to the wind when it blows.\r\n\r\nFloyd, having smoked for a while, tapped the ashes out of his pipe\r\nand rose up. As he was returning to the tent he caught the glimmer of\r\nsomething white among the outer trees of the grove and came toward it.\r\nIt passed among the trees, and he followed it, pushing branches of the\r\nhibiscus aside and trampling down the fern that grew here in profusion.\r\n\r\nHe was following Isbel, and there, in a little glade amid the ferns,\r\nwith her back to an artus tree, crouched in the moonlight, he brought\r\nher to bay.\r\n\r\nThere was something feline in her attitude, as though she were about to\r\nspring, and her eyes were fixed on him steadfastly as though watching\r\nfor his next move.\r\n\r\n\"Isbel,\" he said, speaking loud enough for her to hear, yet not loud\r\nenough to attract the possible attention of Schumer in the tent near\r\nby, \"what is the matter with you? Come, I am not going to hurt you.\r\nDon't you know me?\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand, with the finger-tips pressed together, as one\r\nholds out one's hand to an animal; then he took a step toward her.\r\n\r\nShe turned and whisked away round the tree, and he heard her movements\r\namong the bushes as she vanished from sight.\r\n\r\nHe came out of the grove and went back to the tent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning when he came out of the tent the first thing that struck\r\nhis eye was Isbel. She had returned, and was setting the sticks for the\r\nfire as though nothing had occurred. But when her business was done she\r\nvanished again, reappearing only in time to help in the preparation of\r\nthe evening meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to bring home to your mind, unless you had\r\nexperienced it, the vast change which the presence of the _Southern\r\nCross_ made in the picture of the lagoon. Not on the retinal picture,\r\nbut on the mental.\r\n\r\nHer presence altered everything. The place became a harbor. Those spars\r\nfretting the sky, that hull making green water beneath its copper\r\nbrought civilization up hand over fist from a thousand leagues down\r\nunder.\r\n\r\nLoneliness had vanished, the crying of the gulls lost its melancholy,\r\nand the sound of the surf on the reef, when one noticed it, no longer\r\nspoke of desolation.\r\n\r\nAnd, just as the schooner altered the lagoon, so did the presence of\r\nher crew and the labor men alter the life on the island.\r\n\r\nIn a moment life had become all hurry and work.\r\n\r\nIsbel reappeared regularly to help in the preparation of their food;\r\nshe would be on hand when wanted for any light job, but she never\r\nsat by them now when they talked; she avoided saying a word unless\r\nabsolutely obliged to, and when she spoke she no longer looked Floyd in\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\n\"She is frightened to death of us and she loathes us,\" he thought. \"Me\r\njust as much as him. I don't wonder, either.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer said nothing on the matter; perhaps he was too busy to notice\r\nthe change in the girl. He certainly had his work cut out for him. On\r\nthe first day he had to deal with the labor men, showing them their\r\njob. They knew nothing of pearls or the shell business, but they were\r\nlike otters in the water, and they picked up the small technicalities\r\nof the labor at once.\r\n\r\nSru especially seemed to take to the work as though born to it, and\r\nSchumer left them under his foremanship and returned to the schooner,\r\nwhere he had work for the crew.\r\n\r\nHe wanted a house. He had already picked out the site for it in a\r\nlittle clearing of the grove well protected by the trees from possible\r\nstorms. The wood was ready to his hand in the wreckage of the _Tonga_,\r\nwhich the lagoon currents had driven into the shoal water of the\r\nsouthern beach right opposite to the camping place.\r\n\r\nOf course he could have cut down trees for his building material, but\r\nevery tree in the grove by the camping place was a valuable asset as\r\na shelter against the weather. To have used any of the timber from\r\nthe other groves of the island would have meant not only the labor of\r\nfelling and trimming trees, but of floating them off and towing across\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nHe made Mountain Joe foreman of the new industry, explaining to him\r\ncarefully and minutely the whole business. All planking had to be\r\ncollected, made into small rafts, and towed across the lagoon. The\r\nwhaleboat was used for the purpose, and Schumer accompanied it himself\r\non the first trip to show exactly what he wanted.\r\n\r\nIt took two days' hard work before sufficient planking had been got\r\ntogether, and then began the business of securing and towing across\r\nthe heavy timbers to be used for posts and beams. The whole of this\r\nbusiness from the start of the time when the wood was lying on the sand\r\nnear the tent took over a week, during which time the fishery work was\r\nprogressing, though in a leisurely manner.\r\n\r\n\"There we have thirty chaps at work,\" said Schumer on the night when\r\nthe last of the timber was salved, \"and you'd have imagined that they\r\nwould have done fifteen times as much work as you and I per day. They\r\nhaven't done more than three times as much. They play about in the\r\nwater; they are a bone-lazy lot--well, it doesn't matter. If we had\r\nhalf a dozen dependable overseers to superintend the business when it\r\ncomes to searching for the pearls it would be different, but there is\r\nonly you and me. So it's no earthly use getting huge quantities of\r\nshell of which we can't oversee the working properly. Funny thing it\r\nis, but a business has to slow down unless it is perfect in all parts.\r\nHere we have the getters of the raw stuff, and I could speed them up\r\nfour times their present rate and we'd skin the lagoon four times as\r\nquick if I had even three more men like you and me to supervise the\r\ngetting of the real stuff--which is pearls. Yet if I had those three\r\nmen they would want a partnership and so we'd lose in profits. It's as\r\nbroad as it's long.\"\r\n\r\nThey were sitting by the fire, and Schumer as he talked was putting\r\nfinishing touches to a drawing he was making on a leaf of his\r\npocketbook.\r\n\r\nIt was the plan for the house.\r\n\r\nHe had made the sketch more as an exercise for his restless fingers\r\nthan anything else.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more simple or rudimentary in the way of a house plan.\r\nThe drawing provided for two rooms only, a big room and a little room.\r\nThe main door opened on to the big room.\r\n\r\n\"It won't be much of a house,\" said the architect, as he showed the\r\ndrawing, \"but still it will be a house, and a house is a most important\r\nthing for us. Shelter! I'd just as soon shelter in the tent; sooner,\r\nbut it's not a question of shelter so much as prestige. It's like\r\nwearing a clean shirt. You see, if we live the same as our men they'll\r\nget to think of us as the same, whereas if we live in a house and keep\r\nthem under canvas, or in any old huts they are able to make, they think\r\nof us accordingly. The house gets on their mind. It is the symbol of\r\nauthority and power. It becomes the government building. There's a\r\nwhole lot in that--more than you would think. Then, besides, we want a\r\nsecure place for the pearls. It won't do to keep them under canvas or\r\nin a hole in the ground. I'm going to build as strong as I can and make\r\nthe door to match. We will have loopholes to fire through, in case of\r\neventualities, though I don't think they'll be needed.\r\n\r\n\"The man who has to depend on defending his position by resisting\r\nattack in his own house is a pretty bad administrator.\r\n\r\n\"Still one never knows what may happen, and it is as well to be\r\nprepared.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMOSTLY ABOUT PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took them a fortnight to get the main posts up and the planking\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nJoe proved himself an invaluable worker, with initiative enough to\r\noversee the others, so that both Schumer and Floyd could leave him and\r\ngive their attention to the fishery and the pearl getting. Sru, despite\r\nhis looks and his scars, was shaping well also as an overseer, and the\r\npearls were showing in a satisfactory manner. The pearls taken hitherto\r\nby Schumer and Floyd working alone were all free pearls contained in\r\nthe substance of the oyster or lying loose under the mantle; now began\r\nto come in pearls attached to the shell and shells presenting blisters.\r\n\r\nIt was well that Schumer had some practical knowledge of pearling, or\r\nthese blistered shells might have been cast with the others.\r\n\r\nNow a blister on a pearl shell looks exactly like the bleb raised by a\r\nblister on the human skin. It is caused by some foreign body getting\r\ninto the oyster, causing irritation, and a consequent extra secretion\r\nof nacre which covers the foreign body over. But it must never be\r\nforgotten also that a pearl lying in the shell may cause sufficient\r\nirritation to stimulate this extra secretion of nacre, and that, as a\r\nresult, a blister when opened may be found to contain a pearl.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a month, when the house was nearly finished, they had on\r\ntheir hands two dozen of these blistered shells and a hundred and four\r\npearls as the result of the month's fishing, besides eighteen shells to\r\nwhich pearls were adhering.\r\n\r\nOn paper that would seem to make a good show, but the practical results\r\nwere not so rosy, though fair enough in all conscience, considering the\r\ncheap price of labor.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at a true estimate of the take one must disregard Schumer's\r\nrough statement as to values for something more precise.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable of all pearls are those that are _perfectly round_.\r\n\r\nA perfect pearl must have this shape, and it must have four other\r\nqualities. It must be either pure white or pink; it must be partly\r\ntransparent; it must be free from all specks or blemishes, and it must\r\nhave the true pearl luster.\r\n\r\nNext to the perfect comes the Bouton pearl, flat on one side and convex\r\non the other; lastly comes the drop or pear-shaped pearl.\r\n\r\nAll these belong to the first class, and if they conform to the four\r\ncardinal rules as to transparency, _et cetera_, they are valuable, the\r\nvalue of each depending upon the weight in grains.\r\n\r\nThen come the second class, consisting of imperfectly shaped pearls of\r\ngood luster and quality and perfectly shaped pearls of imperfect luster\r\nand quality.\r\n\r\nLastly we have the baroque pearls.\r\n\r\nThese are sometimes of very large size, but of extraordinary and\r\nirregular shape. They are really masses of nacre that have been formed\r\naround large, rough foreign bodies that have got into the oyster. They\r\nare sometimes hollow, and then they are known to jewelers under the\r\nFrench name _coq de perle_.\r\n\r\nNow of the hundred and four free pearls taken in the month's fishing\r\nonly six were absolutely perfect and only two of these of large size.\r\nYet these two alone well repaid the labor of getting them. Of the\r\nother ninety-eight there were twenty baroques of small value, and of\r\nthe remaining seventy-eight, twenty were estimated by Schumer to be\r\nworthless, the last fifty-eight varying in value from half a sovereign\r\nto four pounds.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether, the catch was good, especially when the blistered\r\nshells were split, for in two of the twenty-four blisters a pearl\r\nwas found of fair quality. The cavities of the remaining \"blisters\"\r\nrevealed nothing but some discolored water that smelled horribly.\r\n\r\nBeside the pearls taken the value of the shell had also to be reckoned.\r\nThe shell was that known to commerce as golden-edged, and its value\r\nmight have been anything from fifty to a hundred pounds a ton.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke of twenty of the pearls being worthless I referred less to\r\nthe pearls than the remains of pearls; every healthy pearl is of some\r\nvalue, even down to the tiny seed pearl, but the pearl, no matter how\r\nlarge, that loses its beauty by disease is worthless.\r\n\r\nIt is the grief of pearl fishing to come across things that a year ago\r\nmay have been worth anything from a couple of hundred to a thousand\r\npounds and that to-day are worthless. Things as ugly as dead cod's\r\neyes that, a year ago, were fit to be the symbols of beauty, and it is\r\nimpossible to say exactly what causes this decay. There may be several\r\ncauses, diseases that attack the pearl as well as the oyster; but the\r\nresult is there as a proof of the vandalism of nature.\r\n\r\nAmong the trade of the _Tonga_ had been some parcels of surgeons'\r\ncotton wool. Schumer rooted a parcel of this out, and, turning the gold\r\nand papers from the cash box, lined it with a sheet of the wool. He\r\nplaced the baroque and lesser-valued pearls on this sheet and covered\r\nthem with a single layer of wool; on this layer he placed the pearls of\r\nthe second order. All those of the first class he kept apart in a small\r\nwooden box, each pearl packed separately in its own nest of wool.\r\n\r\nThe few shells with pearls attached to them he placed in a cocoa box,\r\neach shell in a jacket of wool.\r\n\r\n\"We can't cut the pearls off those shells,\" said he. \"It's jeweler's\r\nwork, and we are only carpenters at the business. They'll keep till we\r\nget them to Europe.\"\r\n\r\nA fortnight later the roof was on the house, a roof thatched with palm\r\nleaves bound down with coconut sennit, and the pearls and all their\r\nother valuables were placed in the smaller of the two rooms.\r\n\r\nThe indefatigable Schumer, immediately the main door was in its place,\r\nset his men to work making a table. The two deck chairs were brought\r\nfrom the _Southern Cross_, also a spare saloon lamp and some drums of\r\nparaffin oil. Otherwise the schooner was left intact.\r\n\r\n\"Those Hakluyts would be sure to make a disturbance if we touched any\r\nof the saloon furniture,\" said Schumer. \"They'd swear, maybe, we had\r\nlooted the ship, and it's my ambition to bring her into Sydney harbor\r\nwith everything standing and without a scratch on her that a Jew could\r\nswear to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Schumer,\" said Floyd, \"I've been thinking of that. When do you intend\r\nthat we should take her to Sydney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"now we have things fixed the sooner we make a\r\nmove the better. At first glance one might say keep her here till we\r\nhave finished with the lagoon and then shin off in her with all the\r\npearls we can get. That's what a fool would say, and that's what a fool\r\nwould do. Where lies the folly? This way.\r\n\r\n\"To keep her like that would mean to steal her, and, as I said before,\r\nyou can't steal a ship these days without being caught. Suppose, even,\r\nwe were to give all the ports in the world good-by and wreck her,\r\nwhere would we be with our pearls on some desolate shore, or if on a\r\ncivilized shore, where would be the customs officers?\r\n\r\n\"No. Pearls aren't worth two cents without a market for them, and we\r\nmust get to Sydney, not only to claim salvage on the schooner and maybe\r\nto get the Hakluyts to let us rent her, but to make the beginning of\r\na market for our stuff. We'll _have_ to bring some one else into the\r\naffair. I wish we hadn't. I've been figuring on every means of getting\r\nout of it, but I can't find a way.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are we to leave the fishery here to itself while we go to Sydney?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't do that; one of us must stay to look after things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Floyd, \"if that is so I know which is the one that will\r\nhave to stay--and that is myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a strange thing,\" said Schumer rather grimly, \"but I had come to\r\nthe same conclusion. I don't undervalue you in the least, as you very\r\nwell know. I try to attach the right values to all things and people.\r\nIt's the only way to arrive at success--but your value as a negotiator\r\nof this business is negligible simply because you have no knowledge of\r\ntrade, and--if you will excuse me for saying so--no stomach for it. If\r\nHakluyt is the man I imagine him to be he'd turn you inside out, pearls\r\nand all, inside two minutes, gobble the pearls and throw away the skin.\r\nNo, I must go and deal with him personally, and you must stay here and\r\nlook after the fishing, but I don't propose to start yet, till we have\r\nthe thing more fully in hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Floyd, \"why not take the schooner back to Sydney,\r\nsell what pearls we have got there, and then, with the money they bring\r\nand the money we have already, charter another schooner for our work.\r\nIn that way we would keep the matter in our own hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"One would think,\" said Schumer, \"from the way you talk, that pearls\r\nwere to be sold as easy as dairy produce. Sydney is the last place\r\nI would sell pearls openly in, and the very last place I would try\r\nto sell them secretly in. Paris is the market for pearls, or London.\r\nBesides, you must remember that Sydney is a sort of center for pearling\r\nin the Australian Pacific, and if wind got about of our island, we\r\nwould be dogged to a certainty.\r\n\r\n\"No, we simply have to get help, and it's better to have one man with\r\nmoney as our partner than half a dozen interlopers crying: 'Share\r\nup, or we'll give the business away.' Of course,\" finished Schumer\r\nmeditatively, \"we could use our guns against them, but those sorts\r\ndon't go unarmed, and we are only two, for the natives don't count.\r\nAs like as not, they'd turn against us from the first, and they'd\r\ncertainly do so if they saw us being beaten.\"\r\n\r\nThey had been sitting under a tree as they talked, close to the nearly\r\ncompleted house, and, as Schumer finished, Floyd saw Isbel coming\r\nacross the lagoon from the fishing grounds in the schooner's dinghy.\r\n\r\nThe dinghy of the _Southern Cross_ was a tiny affair, even for a boat\r\nof this type. It held two at a pinch, and its lines were the lines of a\r\nwalnut shell. It was a dainty little boat, and had evidently belonged\r\nto a yacht at some time or another, to judge by its fittings, or what\r\nwas left of them.\r\n\r\nIsbel was standing up and sculling with a single oar from the stern.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Schumer, \"what has that girl been doing over at the\r\nfishing ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Floyd, shading his eyes; \"didn't know she had gone\r\nthere. She must have gone to the schooner and taken the dinghy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, \"that won't do. I don't want her palling up with\r\nthose labor hands; they are her own people, and she knows a lot too\r\nmuch about us and our affairs to let her get thick with them. She knows\r\nwhere all the trade is cached, for one thing. Besides, she hasn't been\r\nthe same for a long while. I can't get a word out of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has been different ever since you hanged that chap,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she'll have to change her tune, or she'll see the rough side of\r\nme,\" replied the other. \"I'm not going to stand any Kanaka tricks, and\r\nI've shown them that already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me,\" said Floyd, \"that all you have done by that hanging\r\nbusiness is to turn Isbel against us.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer did not reply. He was walking down to the lagoon edge at the\r\npoint where the little boat was preparing to beach.\r\n\r\n\"Hi,\" cried he, \"what have you been doing in that boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Been to the fishing grounds,\" replied the girl, as the dinghy took the\r\nsand and she stepped out into a foot of water and helped Schumer to\r\nhaul the boat up; \"been to see the men; they are my people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they are your people, are they?\" said Schumer. \"Well, you mustn't\r\ngo to them; we want you here. And it seems to me we are your people,\r\ntoo. You have been with us long enough on the island to make you one of\r\nus, and yet you go off at the first chance to your people, as you call\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing; she did not look in his face.\r\n\r\nFloyd, standing by, watched her. She had brought the scull ashore; she\r\nwas holding it in her hand, and, as she stood there in the scanty white\r\ncotton garment that fitted her with the grace that only comes from the\r\nwearer, he thought what a pretty picture she made against the blazing\r\nlagoon and far-off reef.\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" went on Schumer, \"that you are one of us, and belong to the\r\nisland, that we have helped you just as you have helped us, and that\r\nthough you have always been treated with kindness, I can punish those\r\nwho disobey me.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd, as he listened and watched, thought that he perceived the\r\nfaintest curl of her lip at this latter clause, but he could not be\r\nsure; that inscrutable, yet childish, face was very difficult to read,\r\nand more especially now as she raised her eyes to those of Schumer.\r\n\r\n\"I will not use your boat again,\" said she; \"it was only the little\r\none. Do you want me any more now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Schumer, turning away. \"I have nothing more to say.\"\r\n\r\nShe put the scull back in the boat, shaded her eyes, and looked over\r\nthe lagoon toward the fishing ground, as though at some place where her\r\nheart was, but her body could not be.\r\n\r\nFloyd, as he went off to superintend the house-builders, shook his head.\r\n\r\nThe three of them had been almost a little family before this had\r\ntaken place. The pearls were dividing them already. Isbel had become a\r\nstranger to him, and to-morrow Schumer might be his enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPLANS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening, a fortnight later, Schumer, who had just come back from\r\nthe fishing camp, found Floyd seated on the sand near the house and\r\nengaged in mending some tackle. He took his seat beside him, lit a\r\npipe, and gave him news of the day's work.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is shipshape here now,\" finished he, \"and it's time to\r\nstrike for Sydney.\"\r\n\r\n\"When do you propose to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"At once.\"\r\n\r\n\"At once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? There are stores enough on the _Southern Cross_ for the trip,\r\nand it's only a question of getting the water on board; that will take\r\nus a day. The weather promises well, and I'd propose to start the day\r\nafter to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd said nothing for a moment. The projected expedition that would\r\nleave him alone on the island had weighed on his mind for the last\r\nfew days. Whatever Schumer might be, he was a companion, the only\r\nother white man in the place. To be left absolutely alone, with no\r\none to talk to, was a dreary prospect, but it was for the good of the\r\nbusiness, and he was not the man to grumble.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"if it has to be, there is no use talking. We can't\r\nboth leave the place, and since you are the best man for the trade end\r\nof the affair, I must stop, but it will be a pretty lonely business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you'll find lots to do,\" said Schumer, laughing. \"I only hope\r\nyou won't find too much. I have drilled these fellows into pretty\r\nfair discipline, and it's for you to keep it up. I warn you if you\r\ndon't you'll have trouble. You mustn't let them come any of the funny\r\nbusiness over you, and you must back your authority with your gun if\r\nneed be. Your only danger is the cache. We give these fellows tobacco\r\nand so on, and the question hasn't begun to enter their thick heads as\r\nto where all the stores come from, but it may, and if they scent the\r\ncache, there will be trouble. You just remember that knives and trade\r\ngoods are like minted gold to these chaps, and if they suspected a\r\nwhole Bank of England of them here under the trees, they'd ten to one\r\ntry to raid it. You mustn't ever let them land here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet I won't,\" said Floyd. \"How long will you be gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks to get there and three to get back, makes six weeks, and\r\nallowing for a fortnight there--let's say nine weeks to give it a\r\nmargin. You may expect me back in the lagoon in nine weeks. If I'm not\r\nback by then, you may begin to suspect I'm with the sharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will take the money with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course; and I'll take the best of the pearls, too, for several\r\nreasons. First to show our samples, second because I'm leaving you the\r\nlagoon. If I never come back, you'd have the lagoon, and if you bolted\r\nwith the lagoon, I'd have the pearls.\r\n\r\n\"I won't take all the pearls, only a selection of the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" said Floyd. \"I can trust you; and, even if I\r\ncouldn't, you would not be such a fool as to leave a pearl lagoon for\r\nthe sake, of a six weeks' take of pearls. Well, come on to supper;\r\nthere's Isbel laying out the things; we can talk afterward.\"\r\n\r\nThough the house was now finished, with the door on, and the table in,\r\nthey always took their meals in the open. Isbel had laid the plates and\r\nknives and forks on a cloth before the door, and in the center of the\r\ncloth a kava bowl with some flowers in it.\r\n\r\nSchumer was always very punctilious as to the service of meals, laying\r\nthe cloth himself if no one else were there to do it. He had salved\r\nall the _Tonga_ linen, and he would doubtless have insisted on napkins\r\nhad the _Tonga_ carried them; unable to go as far as napkins, he had\r\ncontented himself with flowers. He believed in keeping up appearances,\r\neven if there were no one to observe these appearances but their two\r\nselves and Isbel, and he was right. Slackness is one of the rots of the\r\nworld, and the least bit of ceremonial is the finest tonic in life.\r\n\r\nIsbel, who never ate with them now by any chance, and who had\r\nvoluntarily debased herself from the position of companion to the\r\ncondition of servant, went off and left them to their food. The sun\r\nsank behind the reef, and in a sky of pansy blue the first vague sketch\r\nof the constellation began to show itself to the darkening sea. Then\r\nalmost as though touched off by a taper, the stars blazed out, crusting\r\nwith light the whole dome from the sea line to the zenith. It was the\r\nnight before the new moon, and always on these nights when the whole\r\nlighting of the world was left to the stars a deeper peace seemed to\r\npervade the island and the ocean and the sky. The voice of the reef\r\nseemed to sink lower, and the night wind to blow warmer, and the lagoon\r\nto hold in its depths a profounder calm.\r\n\r\nThe wind to-night brought faint odors of vanilla and frangipanni from\r\nthe trees of the grove, and across the lagoon a trace of song from\r\nthe camping place by the fishing ground. The natives were amusing\r\nthemselves, and the light of their camp fire showed like a red spark\r\nacross the starlit water.\r\n\r\nThe two men on the beach sat smoking and watching the schooner as she\r\nrode to her anchor, with a single light showing. The Kanaka crew, whom\r\nSchumer had always kept apart from the labor men, were on deck, and\r\ntheir forms could be seen indistinctly in the starlight as they lounged\r\nabout, smoking and yarning. A fellow was fishing over the after rail,\r\nand now and then one could see a splash in the water and a streak of\r\nsilver, as a groper was hauled up.\r\n\r\nFaint and far away and coming, no doubt, from the fo'c'sle could be\r\nheard the strains of a concertina playing a thready and wandering air,\r\nwhile occasionally across the lagoon from the deep soundings came the\r\nsplash of a great fish jumping, while the ring of it spread in a circle\r\nof silver on the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSCHUMER GOES AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThey got the water on board next day, and the day following they were\r\nup before dawn to catch the slack of the tide which was due an hour\r\nafter sunrise. It would then be still water at the break in the reef.\r\n\r\nSchumer had made all his last preparations the night before. He would\r\nbreakfast on board the schooner when she was free of the lagoon, and\r\nas Floyd rowed him across in the dinghy, the sky over the eastern reef\r\nwas paling, and the stars above, that had been leaping all night like\r\nhearts of fire, showed signs of the coming day.\r\n\r\nWhen Schumer was on board, Floyd pushed off again, having wished him\r\ngood luck, and then hung on his oars half a cable length away, watching\r\nthe preparations for departure.\r\n\r\nHe could hear Schumer's voice giving orders, and the bare feet of the\r\nfellows on deck running forward to the capstan.\r\n\r\n\"Break down,\" came the order, and following it the chorus of the\r\nKanakas mixed with the rasp of the anchor chain as the slack of it came\r\nin, till the order was given, \"Vast leaving.\"\r\n\r\nAll sound now ceased, and at that moment, just as the first light of\r\nday was striking the palm fronds and the topmost spars of the _Southern\r\nCross_, the schooner, riding at her taut anchor chain, seemed the ghost\r\nof a ship stricken suddenly into unreality by the profound silence that\r\nhad suddenly fallen upon her. A moment passed, and then the voice of\r\nSchumer came again, ordering the hands to set the mainsail, and to haul\r\non the throat and peak halyards.\r\n\r\nThere was scarcely a trace of morning bank in the east, and the light,\r\nnow strengthening rapidly, showed the great trapezium of canvas\r\nslatting to the faint and favorable wind. Then the foresail took the\r\nbreeze, dusky forms swarming on the jib boom were casting the gaskets\r\noff the jib, now the men on deck were hauling at the jib halyards, and\r\njust as a horse answers to the pull of the bit, the _Southern Cross_\r\nveered round to the pressure of the sail, while the voice of Schumer\r\ncame again, ordering the anchor to be hove up.\r\n\r\nAs it left the water and rose to the cathead, the schooner, with way on\r\nalready, began to steal toward the reef opening, the first rays of the\r\nsun turning her canvas to vague gold against the new-born blue of the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe form of Schumer appeared for a moment at the after rail and waved a\r\nhand, then it vanished, and Floyd, having watched the _Southern Cross_\r\nmake her first bow to the swell of the outside sea, returned to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nHe hauled the dinghy up, and then, climbing across the coral to the\r\nbreak in the reef, watched the dwindling sail, till the sun dazzle half\r\nblinded him. Then he turned away and sought the house.\r\n\r\nThe two men had used the main room of the house for sleeping in at\r\nnight, a bunk mattress taken from the _Southern Cross_ being placed in\r\neach corner, and removed in the daytime to the smaller room. Floyd,\r\nwithout waiting for Isbel's help, removed the mattresses, and then\r\nbegan to wash and shave. The trade room of the _Tonga_ had supplied\r\nthem with all toilet necessaries, even to scissors, and its saloon\r\nhad given them a mirror; as Floyd's eyes fell now on the scissors he\r\nrecalled the fact that Schumer had been his hair cutter, even as he had\r\nbeen Schumer's. Well, it would be nine weeks before he would have the\r\nchance of a haircut, unless he could press Sru into the business. The\r\nthought of this made him laugh as he left the house and came out on the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nIsbel had lit the fire and laid the breakfast things. She was turning\r\naway when he stopped her.\r\n\r\n\"Schumer is gone,\" said he; \"he has taken the ship and gone away, but\r\nhe will be back in a little time.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will be back----\" She broke off the sentence and raised her eyes\r\nto his, and though she was gazing full at him, she did not seem to see\r\nhim. She seemed looking at something a hundred miles away, and the\r\nsensation of being gazed through as though he were clear as glass, and\r\nabsolutely negligible, gave Floyd a queer sensation--almost a shiver.\r\n\r\n\"In a while,\" said he. \"What ails you, Isbel--what have I done to you\r\nthat has altered you so? We used to be good friends. It was not my\r\nfault, that trouble with one of your people; he had killed a man. He\r\nhad committed murder, and the man who commits murder must die.\"\r\n\r\nIsbel listened to him just as though she were listening to the sound\r\nof the sea or the wind, with the same far-away look, the same air of\r\nabstraction. Then she said, speaking not in answer to him, but as\r\nthough she were making a statement about some ordinary matter:\r\n\r\n\"I have no peace here. I wish to go to my own people. Schumer will come\r\nback, but he will not find me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" said Floyd. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nBut she would say nothing more; she would not even look him again\r\nin the face, and, irritated at last, he turned away and sat down to\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nIf Schumer were to come back and not find her, where on earth did she\r\npropose to go? What did she mean? For a moment the horrid idea occurred\r\nto him that she might intend suicide; then he dismissed it; Isbel was\r\nnot the sort of person to commit self-murder without any appreciable\r\ncause; though mysterious enough, she was too healthy and sane for that\r\nfolly. All the same, as he breakfasted, her words kept ringing in his\r\nhead:\r\n\r\n\"Schumer will come back, but he will not find me.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows,\" thought he, \"it will be hard enough here all alone without\r\nher bolting off or doing something foolish--anyhow, there is nowhere\r\nfor her to bolt to, unless she bolts into the lagoon--confound Schumer\r\nand his methods. If he had left that chap alone, she would not have\r\ntaken this dead set against us.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished breakfast, he went to the pierhead at the break\r\non the reef and swept the sea line with his eyes. Away, far away,\r\nlike a flake of white spar, a sail showed against the sky. It was the\r\n_Southern Cross_, almost hull down on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST OF THE TWO PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe came back to the beach.\r\n\r\nSchumer had left him two boats, the dinghy and the boat of the\r\n_Cormorant_. They were both on the beach, and as the dinghy was the\r\neasiest to launch single-handed, he used it and pushed off to the\r\nfishing ground.\r\n\r\nThe gulls started after him from the reef opening, and now their voices\r\ncame singly, mewing and miauling, the very voice of desolation itself.\r\n\r\nLooking back as he rowed, he could see the figure of Isbel; she was\r\nputting things straight about the house, and just at that moment, as\r\nif stirred by the loneliness and the voices of the gulls, his heart\r\nwent out to her. She was the only live thing in all that place for him.\r\nThere were living things--fish in the lagoon and Kanaka laborers on the\r\nreef--but Isbel was the only warm spot for his mind to cling to.\r\n\r\nThe child had differentiated herself from her surroundings. By some\r\nextraordinary magic she had, without effort and almost without speech,\r\npushed the image of Schumer to one side, and the forms of the Kanakas\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nSchumer, despite his powerful personality, seemed a dead thing beside\r\nIsbel, and the Kanakas, powerful and brawny as they were, seemed\r\npuppets--things of mechanism--fantoccini. What was the magic property\r\nthat gave her the ascendency in the mind of Floyd?\r\n\r\nFor one thing, Isbel, despite her silence, her self-isolation, and the\r\nother-world atmosphere with which she surrounded herself, had always\r\nproved herself sterling.\r\n\r\nNever had she failed them in any least particular, every humble duty\r\nthat had fallen to her she had carried out honestly, and no paid\r\nservant could have worked more industriously in their interests.\r\n\r\nLike Schumer, she had a strong personality that spoke in her actions\r\nand her movements. Unlike Schumer, her personality remained with\r\none even in her absence. She was a good memory and a living memory.\r\nSchumer, in his absence--despite his wonderful personality--was only\r\nthe recollection of a strong man absent.\r\n\r\nThat is all the difference between the mechanical and the vital,\r\nbetween the grip of iron and the grip of flesh.\r\n\r\nThen she was a woman, or at least the germ of a woman; she was\r\ngraceful, she was pretty as a wild flower, and, above all, she was an\r\nunknown factor, a hint of strangeness, the suggestion of a being from\r\nanother star.\r\n\r\nAs he rowed, widening the distance between himself and the camping\r\nplace, he was considering Isbel in all her aspects; the absence of\r\nSchumer and the loneliness and isolation of his own position had thrown\r\nher, so to speak, into the arms of his mind. He was considering also\r\nthe fatal effect that had followed on the sight of the hanging. She had\r\nnever been the same since that. The deed had stricken division between\r\nthem, had called up all the barriers of race which she had expressed in\r\nthose memorable words: \"I have no rest here. I wish to go back to my\r\nown people.\" When he reached the fishing ground, he found the work in\r\nfull swing under the supervision of Sru.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was seated on a coral lump, smoking, and the lagoon,\r\nclose to the shore, was occupied by what might have seemed, at first\r\nsight, a bathing party.\r\n\r\nThey did not use a boat now; they had constructed a raft, and all round\r\nthe raft bobbed the heads of the pearl fishers, while on the raft\r\nitself several more were stretched, sunning themselves and smoking. All\r\nwere stark naked and seemed happy as children.\r\n\r\nSru alone was garbed, and his simple dress consisted of a G string.\r\n\r\nSru saluted Floyd as the boat approached, and left his seat to help\r\nin beaching her; then he stood by Floyd as the latter inspected the\r\nfew shells that had been taken already that morning. Sru was the only\r\none of the working party who could talk in English, and though his\r\nconversation was as scanty as his G string, he could make himself\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nAs Floyd conversed with this man, he experienced a new sensation.\r\nSchumer had done the overseeing of the overseer up to this; Floyd\r\nhad never come closely in contact with the men, and now, as he stood\r\non the burning beach, almost in touch with Sru, he felt as though he\r\nwere standing in touch with some man of the stone age and the silurian\r\nbeaches.\r\n\r\nThe whites of Sru's eyes had a yellow tinge, and the glint of his teeth\r\nas he raised his lip was like a gleam of ivory reflected from a million\r\nyears ago, the scars on his breast and arms, seen close to like this,\r\nhad a deep significance, and the smell of him, hot, gorse-like, and\r\nfaintly goatlike, was the smell of all fierce and savage things, hinted\r\nat and vaguely expressed. The John Tan plug he was smoking lent its\r\nfierce perfume to the natural scent of him, and he spat between his\r\nteeth and grumbled in his throat when he was not talking.\r\n\r\nSru was a revelation when you found yourself close to him like this,\r\nunder the sun on a desolate beach, and with civilization thousands of\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Floyd ordered the raft to be brought to the beach edge,\r\nand, getting on to it, pushed out to inspect the work of the divers.\r\n\r\nOysters do not lie flat at the bottom of the sea; they lean with mouths\r\nagape at an angle of twenty to twenty-five degrees with the sea floor.\r\nThe great clams do likewise. Floyd, looking down, could see the men who\r\nhad just dived groping along the bottom, skylarking as they worked.\r\nOne fellow who was in the act of rising with a couple of shells which\r\nhe had secured, was caught by the foot by a companion. He dropped the\r\nshells and retaliated, the pair coming to the surface, bursting with\r\nwant of air and suppressed laughter.\r\n\r\nAs Schumer said, they were like children, and their work had a large\r\nelement of play in it. Still, they worked after their fashion, wet\r\nhands continually seizing the raft edge and depositing the dripping\r\nshells on it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the quickest way of dealing with oysters in the mass is by\r\nrotting them, the search for pearls can be conducted on oysters fresh\r\nfrom the sea, and Floyd, as he sat on the raft, amused himself by\r\nopening some of the shells with his pocketknife, choosing the largest\r\nfor this purpose. He found no pearls, but plenty of surprises. Nearly\r\nevery large oyster in the southern seas gives shelter to a \"messmate.\"\r\nA little crab, a small lobster, a worm, or a shrimp, lives in the shell\r\nalong with the host. In some fisheries, as down in Sooloo, lobsters\r\nare only found, but here, as Floyd opened shell after shell, there was\r\nalways something new--now a crab, now a worm, now a harmless creature,\r\nhalf shrimp, half crawfish.\r\n\r\nTiring of the business at last, he put ashore and turned his attention\r\nto the heap of shell \"ripe\" and gaping, putrid from exposure to the\r\nair, and waiting to be searched for pearls. He had got so used to the\r\nbusiness now that it was scarcely unpleasant. Sru and one of the hands\r\nassisted him, and the work went forward without result for an hour, not\r\neven a seed pearl appearing in all the slimy mess carefully washed out\r\nin the trough of the canvas.\r\n\r\nSchumer seemed to have taken the luck away with him. They knocked off\r\nfor a rest and a smoke, and then went at it again with, as a final\r\nresult of their morning's labor, a baroque pearl about the size of a\r\nsixpence, and a pearl of indifferent luster and weighing about ten\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\n\"No good,\" said Sru, with a grunt of dissatisfaction; \"heap few, heap\r\nbig work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heap plenty, maybe soon,\" replied Floyd, turning away. He felt\r\ndepressed without the least reason for being so. No one knew better\r\nthan he the uncertainties of this work, and how much it approximates\r\nto gambling. It was, perhaps, the feeling that Schumer had taken the\r\nluck away with him that caused the depression. Want of success is never\r\ninspiriting; actual defeat is a better tonic for the mind. He placed\r\nthe morning's catch in the box he carried for the purpose, and, getting\r\nin the boat, rowed back to the encampment.\r\n\r\nWork was never carried on during the middle of the day, and it was not\r\ntill three o'clock in the afternoon that he returned.\r\n\r\nIsbel had prepared his midday meal for him, and he left her behind,\r\nputting things in order. He had scarcely spoken to her, judging that in\r\nher present humor it was better to say nothing and trust to time and\r\nthe absence of Schumer to soothe her feelings. He knew little of the\r\nmentality of Isbel. Arrived at the fishing grounds, he set to with Sru\r\non a heap of shells that lay awaiting treatment.\r\n\r\nThe size of the oysters to be dealt with varied considerably. Nothing,\r\nindeed, varies much more than the size of the pearl oysters as taken in\r\nthe different fisheries of the world. In some places the oysters are\r\nso small that from three to four thousand go to make a ton; in others\r\nthey are so large that a ton weight of them only runs to four or five\r\nhundred. Occasionally gigantic specimens are obtained, weighing from\r\nfourteen to sixteen pounds, bare shells.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these oysters being handled by Floyd and Sru would\r\nhave scaled a thousand to the ton, perhaps, and the medium size about\r\nfifteen hundred.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon work was scarcely more fruitful than the morning. It\r\nbegan with the capture of two small, but almost perfect, pearls,\r\nglobular in shape, but weighing, perhaps, less than fifteen grains.\r\nThese were taken in the first fifteen minutes, and then for the next\r\nthree hours nothing showed but slush and slime.\r\n\r\nThe oysters one after the other were cleared out into the canvas trough\r\nwith a sweep of the finger. Each pair of shells were then examined for\r\nadhering pearls or blisters, and flung aside if showing neither. Then,\r\nwhen sufficient putrefying matter had been collected in the troughs, it\r\nwas carefully washed away and searched.\r\n\r\nThe shells cast aside were collected by two of the men and stored.\r\n\r\nIt was just at sunset, and at the washing of the last lot, that Floyd,\r\ngroping in the seaweed-colored and viscous mass in the trough, felt his\r\nfingers closing upon a pebble. From the size of the object, he fancied\r\nfor a second that it was a pebble. Instantly, and before he had brought\r\nit to light, he knew it to be a pearl.\r\n\r\nIt was. A perfectly round pearl, of enormous size, at least enormous\r\nin comparison with all the pearls he had hitherto seen. But it was not\r\ntill he had cleansed it of slime in the bucket of water which Sru held\r\nfor him that he saw what a prize he had obtained.\r\n\r\nIt was near sunset, and the golden light, mellow and tremulous, that\r\nwas illuminating the sea and turning the west to flame, lit the\r\ntreasure lying in the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a pink pearl, exquisite, lustrous, and almost, one might say,\r\nluminous. It was the size of a marble. Not one of those enormous\r\nglass marbles with colored cores which we all remember as objects of\r\nworship, but an ordinary, practicable, play-with-able marble of full\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nSru grunted.\r\n\r\nTo Sru all this lust for pearls was an inexplicable business. If it had\r\nbeen a hunt for colored beads, he could have understood it, but pearls\r\nto him had no more beauty than cod's eyes, and far less beauty than\r\ncolored shells. Coming from a district where pearling was unknown, he\r\nhad no idea, either, of the value of these things.\r\n\r\nBut even to Sru the new find was pleasing, because of its color, the\r\nvague luminous pink, the luster, the semi-translucency, and the perfect\r\nshape of the thing pleased him.\r\n\r\nBut they did not excite him. He could not understand that the lump of\r\ncolored nacre that weighed, perhaps, two hundred grains, and was worth,\r\nperhaps, five thousand pounds, was the equivalent of mountains of plug\r\ntobacco, shiploads of cotton stuff, knives, guns, and ammunition,\r\noceans of gin.\r\n\r\nFloyd, after his momentary exclamation, controlled himself, turned the\r\nthing over in his hand as though it were some ordinary object, and then\r\nput it in the pearl box, carefully covering it with the cotton wool. He\r\nput the box in the pocket of his coat, which lay near by, and turned\r\nagain to the searching of the last remnants of stuff in the trough.\r\nNothing more showed, and, having washed his hands in the canvas bucket\r\nwhich Sru held for him, he put on his coat, and, having given him some\r\ndirections as to the storing of the shell, returned across the lagoon\r\nto the house.\r\n\r\nHe knew that what he had in his pocket was worth all the stuff they\r\nhad taken from the lagoon. Schumer had educated him on the subject of\r\npearls, but even Schumer, with all his knowledge, could not have fixed\r\nthe value of this splendid find, perfect in all parts, and weighing at\r\nleast a hundred grains.\r\n\r\nAfter supper he took it out of its box and examined it by the light of\r\nthe fire. It was even more beautiful by the glow of the burning sticks\r\nthan by the glow of the sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE VANISHING OF ISBEL\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, when Floyd came out on the beach, he could not find Isbel.\r\n\r\nHe called to her, and there was no reply; then he started off to hunt\r\nfor her in the grove, but she was not there.\r\n\r\nHe went to the seaward side of the reef; the breakers were falling and\r\nthe gulls flying, but there was no sign of Isbel. She had vanished as\r\ncompletely as though she had never been. Floyd, in perplexity, shaded\r\nhis eyes and gazed toward the sea line, as though he fancied some ship\r\nmight have come and taken her off, but the sea line was as empty as\r\nthe sea, and the only thing visible away out there was a frigate bird\r\nsailing on the wind.\r\n\r\nThe bird was passing the island with supreme indifference, traveling\r\nunder the dominion of some steady purpose, and heading for some\r\ndestination, perhaps half a thousand miles away. It dwindled in the\r\nblue, and Floyd, turning, took his way back to the beach.\r\n\r\nThe dinghy and quarter boat were still there, otherwise he might\r\nhave fancied that she had gone to the fishing camp; the thing seemed\r\ninexplicable, and trying to put it from his mind, he set to on the\r\npreparations for breakfast. He lit the fire and put some water on to\r\nboil, opened some canned stuff, and then, having set a plate and knife\r\nand fork, made the coffee. He did all this automatically, working by\r\ninstinct and habit, and almost heedless of what he was doing. A great\r\ndesolation had fallen upon him, and a great fear, and in the midst of\r\nthis desolation and fear something was calling out to him, a voice he\r\nhad never heard before.\r\n\r\nWith the food untasted before him, he sat with his chin on his hands,\r\ngazing at the beach, white in the burning sunshine, and across the\r\nwater of the lagoon, blue and ruffled by the morning wind.\r\n\r\nIsbel, from the very first, had been for him a pleasing figure, quaint\r\nand with something of mystery about it. He did not know till now how\r\nmuch of his subconscious life she had occupied, nor how much he had\r\nreally cared for her. She had grown on him till he had come to love\r\nher; that was the fact, and a fact that he recognized now in the pain\r\nand fear and desolation of his heart.\r\n\r\nIt was the strangest and rarest form of love, this love of his for\r\nIsbel. The love of a lonely man for a flower, or a child, and with just\r\nthe hint of the love of a man for a woman.\r\n\r\nShe was the germ of a woman, and by just that extent did the bond of\r\nsex hold him to her.\r\n\r\nHis life had been very lonely. Right up from his boyhood he had lived\r\npretty much uncared for. He had made friendships, but the wandering\r\nlife of the sea breaks ties just as it casts away lives; he had no\r\nhome, no family, and the men he had grown to care for, old chums and\r\nmessmates, were like the gulls--once parted from and lost to sight,\r\nnever to be found again.\r\n\r\nAs he sat like this, on the wind which was setting across the lagoon\r\nfrom the fishing ground, came a snatch of song from the fishermen who\r\nwere at work.\r\n\r\nHe rose up, and, leaving the food still untasted, came down to the\r\nwater's edge and, pushing the dinghy off, got into her and sculled\r\nacross to the camp.\r\n\r\nHe had some thought of telling his trouble to Sru, and some vague idea\r\nof seeking help from him. Never for a moment had the idea come to him\r\nthat Isbel might have joined the fishing camp.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible for her to have got there across the rough coral\r\nof the reef, and equally impossible across the lagoon. Yet when he\r\nlanded, the first object that caught his eye was Isbel. She was seated\r\nin front of one of the tents engaged in shredding some coconut pulp\r\ninto a bowl, and when she saw him she did not seem at all put out.\r\n\r\nShe had gone back to her own people, literally, and to look at her he\r\nmight have fancied she had never parted from them. Floyd nodded to her.\r\nHe could have laughed aloud in the relief of seeing her safe and sound;\r\nshe nodded in return, and went on with her work. She did not seem in\r\nthe least put out or ashamed of herself for having deserted him, and\r\nnow that his fears about her were removed, he felt irritated at her\r\ncoolness.\r\n\r\nAll the hard things that Schumer had said about Kanakas rose up in his\r\nmind--\"animals dressed in human skin,\" \"creatures without souls,\" and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\nBut these sayings vanished from his mind almost immediately. They had\r\nno clutch in them, simply because they had no truth in them, and\r\nIsbel, as she sat at work before the tent, formed their last antidote.\r\n\r\nNever had she looked prettier than this morning, seated there on a\r\nlittle mat, a fresh scarlet flower in her hair, her feet tucked away,\r\nand her brown hands busily at work.\r\n\r\nFloyd came up to her.\r\n\r\n\"So there you are, Isbel,\" said he. \"I did not think you would have\r\ngone off and left me like that.\"\r\n\r\nIsbel made no reply; she continued her work without looking up; one\r\nmight have fancied that she had not heard him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Floyd, \"if you had told me, I would not have tried\r\nto stop you. Why should I? You are perfectly free here to do as you\r\nplease. I would even have brought you here myself in the boat. How did\r\nyou get here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Along the reef,\" said Isbel, without looking up.\r\n\r\n\"Along the reef--why, you must have cut your feet to pieces!\"\r\n\r\nFor reply Isbel pushed a foot out from under her robe.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect little foot, honey-colored, perfect in form, the\r\ntoenails polished like agate. He had seen it often before, but it\r\nseemed to him that he saw it now for the first time. As he looked at it\r\nthe toes spread apart, and it was flexed and extended, as if to show\r\nthat it had sustained neither scratch nor injury. Then it vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are cleverer than I am,\" said Floyd. He would not stoop to\r\nquestion her as to how she had negotiated the reef. If she did not\r\nchoose to tell, why, then let her keep silent. He turned on his heel\r\nand walked off to where Sru was waiting for him. Then, as they made for\r\nthe place where the oysters were lying ready to be examined, he glanced\r\nback; she had vanished into the tent.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing to Sru on the matter, nor did the foreman make any\r\ncomment about the girl. They set to on their task, working an hour\r\nwithout any result, and then knocking off for a rest and a smoke.\r\n\r\nIt was during the second spell, and Floyd had just turned to place the\r\nonly take of the morning, a small and nearly valueless pearl, in the\r\nbox, which he carried for the purpose, when their attention was drawn\r\nby shouts from the fellows who were working in the lagoon.\r\n\r\nThey had been shouting and splashing at their work, but these outcries\r\nhad a new note that brought Floyd and Sru to their feet in a moment,\r\nand down to the lagoon edge.\r\n\r\nThe dinghy, in which Floyd had come over, was lying on the sand, with\r\nthe incoming tide rippling up to her; they pushed her off, reached the\r\nraft, and found what was the matter.\r\n\r\nOne of the workers, Timau by name, while groping along the bottom of\r\nthe lagoon, had stepped into a half-open clamshell, the shell had\r\nclosed on his foot like a trap, and he was a prisoner.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most terrible accidents that can happen to the\r\npearl fisher. The great clam grows to an enormous size, and, like the\r\noyster, he does not lie flat on the sea floor, but tilted at an angle\r\nof twenty-five degrees or more. The sand, if there be much sand where\r\nhe lies, tends to silt round him and hide him, and so he lies, a\r\nveritable man-trap for the unwary.\r\n\r\nThe raft was crowded with men, all shouting, and not one of them,\r\nseemingly, with the vestige of an idea as to how they were to render\r\nassistance. Timau could be seen clearly; he had fallen on his back,\r\nwith his right leg bent and the knee pointing upward; the right foot\r\nwas held by the terrific shell, whose contracting muscles were powerful\r\nas iron bands.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more shocking than this seizure of a man by a\r\nshellfish, this quiet destruction of the highest form of life by the\r\nlowest form of intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe shark moves under the dominion of will, and the cuttlefish knows\r\nat least hunger, but the great clam is fed by the water that laves it,\r\nand its only expression of will is to grip and hold whatever dares to\r\nviolate its sanctuary.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Floyd was as much at a loss as the others; then he saw on\r\nthe raft the iron bar used for breaking down coral formations that were\r\nencroaching on the beds. It was about two-thirds of the thickness of an\r\nordinary crowbar, and measured about three feet in length.\r\n\r\nHe scrambled on to the raft, seized the bar, and dived.\r\n\r\nHe was not wearing his coat, but otherwise he was fully dressed; in the\r\nmoment between seizing the bar and diving he had thought out the whole\r\nplan of action. The great clam, inclined to an angle of twenty degrees,\r\nhad to be pried open, and to do so the under shell had to be brought\r\nlevel with the lagoon floor, so as to obtain a purchase.\r\n\r\nThe watchers above saw him thrust the bar between the shells, an act\r\neasy enough to accomplish, as they were held four inches and more apart\r\nby the victim's leg. This done, he inserted his booted foot as if to\r\ntread down the under shell, while he levered up the top shell.\r\n\r\nHe had reckoned on his weight being sufficient to press down the shell,\r\nforgetting that a man weighed in sea water scales very much less\r\nthan a man weighed in air. Yet, even so, he managed to reduce very\r\nconsiderably the angle, and with a tremendous effort managed to wrench\r\nthe two shells apart.\r\n\r\nHe rose instantly, nearly bursting for want of air, and as he rose the\r\nfellows on the raft, courageous enough now, dived like one man to fetch\r\nup the body of Timau.\r\n\r\nThey brought it to the raft, where Floyd was resting, and hauled it on\r\nto the logs, while Floyd, on hands and knees, examined it.\r\n\r\nTimau seemed a very dead man. The right foot and part of the leg was\r\nblack and lacerated; there was neither movement of heart nor sign of\r\nrespiration, and Sru, who had also bent down to examine him, rose up\r\nwith a grunt.\r\n\r\n\"Heap dead,\" said Sru; \"no more fishing for Timau.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd ordered them to push the raft ashore. This having been done, he\r\nhad the body laid out on the hot sand, and started to work at once with\r\nartificial respiration.\r\n\r\nHe had to do the business alone, for not one of the hands could\r\nunderstand what was required to be done, nor would they have helped had\r\nthey understood. This was witch business; the man was dead and beyond\r\nrecall; it was plainly against nature to try and bring him back.\r\n\r\nHowever, back he came. Floyd had been working for some ten minutes when\r\nthe first signs of returning life showed themselves. Ten minutes later\r\nTimau was leaning on his elbow, blinking at the world to which he had\r\nreturned, hiccuping and endeavoring to speak.\r\n\r\nFloyd had him carried up to the nearest tent and laid on a mat. Then,\r\nwith the help of Isbel, who had suddenly appeared, he set to to dress\r\nthe injured foot. The lower end of the fibula was fractured, all the\r\nskin over the lower part of the leg was lacerated and bruised, and\r\nthere was a nasty cut on the instep. They laid wet cloths on the\r\nwounds, made a bandage over them of coconut sennit, and left him so far\r\nrecovered that he was able to smoke a pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE MIRACLE\r\n\r\n\r\nTimau made a good recovery. In a couple of days he was hobbling about\r\nwith the aid of a stick, and in a week, but for the bandage on his foot\r\nand leg, he seemed a well man.\r\n\r\nHe was also a distinguished personage in a way; honored as a man\r\nreturned from the grave, yet, at the same time, avoided as much as\r\npossible. In other words, he was feared, and he made the best of the\r\nsituation by doing no work and drawing full allowances in food and\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nHe did not show the least outward gratitude toward Floyd for his rescue\r\nand restoration, and Floyd, in his turn, found himself somewhat in the\r\nsame position as Timau.\r\n\r\nSru, while working just the same, showed considerable reserve in his\r\ndealings with his manager. A man who could bring a corpse back to life\r\nwas not a person to be dealt with lightly, and the strange thing was,\r\nthat Floyd's beneficent action did not seem to strike Sru in the light\r\nof beneficence. It was quite plainly evident that it was looked upon\r\nmore as an act of evil than of good.\r\n\r\nThe other natives seemed of the same mind as Sru; they never laughed\r\nand tom-fooled now when Floyd was present--they worked better.\r\n\r\nIsbel seemed quite unmoved. He saw her now nearly every day when he\r\ncame to the fishing camp; she had quite settled down in her new home,\r\nand seemed always busy, yet somehow to Floyd's eyes she seemed changed.\r\nIt was toward the first week of Schumer's absence that Floyd became\r\nfully alive to this change in her. She was no longer a child. Just as\r\nsome tropical plants bloom in a night, so in the course of a few weeks\r\nshe had changed, at least to his eyes. It was as though a new person\r\nhad come upon the island.\r\n\r\nBut the miracle of the change in her had touched him, too.\r\n\r\nThe whole world seemed suddenly altered. Life, in a moment, had become\r\na different thing. Life, in a moment, had become worth living, the sky\r\nand sea bluer, the sun more friendly, the island more beautiful.\r\n\r\nIsbel had not changed the least in her manner toward him, but the\r\nmagic of life that had touched her had touched him through her. She\r\nwas always in his thoughts--when he returned at night to the house,\r\nand when he returned in the morning to the fishing ground, when he lay\r\nawake at night and when he worked with Sru by day.\r\n\r\nHe was in love, but he did not recognize the fact for a long time, and\r\neven then he formed no plans and dreamed no dreams after the fashion of\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Isbel was enough, the sight of her, the memory of her.\r\n\r\nHad she shown by the faintest sign that she was thinking of him, it\r\nwould have been different. The will to possess her would have at once\r\narisen. But she showed nothing, living and moving as remote from him\r\nas the moon that silvered the reef and shone upon the water.\r\n\r\nOne morning Floyd, who ever since the departure of Schumer had\r\nrecorded the time by making a notch each morning on the doorpost,\r\ncompleted the forty-ninth notch. It was exactly seven weeks since\r\nSchumer's departure. He had lost all record of the day of the week.\r\nThe _Cormorant_ had been lost on a Wednesday, and on landing he could\r\neasily have reckoned the day by the time spent in the boat, but he had\r\nnot troubled. Schumer had also lost the day of the week, but the loss\r\naffected them very little here, where even the hour of the day was of\r\nsmall account.\r\n\r\n\"He ought to be back in a fortnight,\" said Floyd to himself, as he sat\r\ndown in the shadow of the house to smoke a pipe before starting for the\r\nfishing ground. \"Wonder what luck he's had.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat smoking and reviewing the events that had happened since\r\nSchumer's departure and the take of pearls.\r\n\r\nSince the capture of the pink pearl, luck had been very uneven. All\r\ntold, the take had amounted to a hundred and five, leaving out seeds\r\nand worthless specimens. Of these only twenty were of any considerable\r\nsize or value. There were also twenty-five blistered shells, which\r\nFloyd had put aside to be dealt with by Schumer.\r\n\r\nThe unevenness of the luck lay in the fact that during some weeks the\r\ncatch would be quite negligible, during others quite good; some days\r\nwould be blank, while on the other hand three of the best had been\r\ntaken on the same day.\r\n\r\nTo-day was to prove lucky, for when he approached the fishing ground,\r\nSru approached him with a large oyster in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe natives ate oysters sometimes, always cooking them first, a strange\r\nthing, considering the fact that they would eat fish not only raw, but\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the oysters destined for food. It had been opened, and\r\nwhen Sru reached Floyd, he lifted the upper shell, and, putting his\r\nfinger under the mantel, raised it, disclosing a loose pearl.\r\n\r\nIt was as big as the great pink pearl, but of a virginal white. Floyd\r\nhad experienced many sensations in life, but none so vividly pleasant\r\nas now at the sight of this thing fresh from the lagoon, and in its\r\nstrange home.\r\n\r\nThe pink pearl had been fished out of a mess of putrescence, but here\r\nwas a gem handed to him as if by the dripping hand of the sea.\r\n\r\nHe took the oyster, carefully extracted the pearl, and held it in his\r\npalm, while Sru looked on, evidently pleased with himself, and the\r\nother hands stood around, glad of any opportunity to knock off work.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Floyd; \"you shall have two sticks of tobacco for this, and\r\nI will give the same to any one who finds another like it.\"\r\n\r\nHe put it in the box, trying to assume as careless a manner as\r\npossible, and then turned to the work of the day, ordering at the same\r\ntime the idlers to get back to the lagoon.\r\n\r\nWhen the day's work was over, Sru demanded his tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" said Floyd. \"I will fetch it over in the morning when I\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nBut Sru, who was very much of a child, despite his size and strength,\r\nwas not to be put off till the morrow. He wanted his reward at once,\r\nand Floyd, irritated, yet amused at his persistency, ordered him to\r\nget into the dinghy and accompany him across the lagoon to the camping\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHere he left him by the boat, while he went off to the cache for the\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nHe had to remove the tarpaulin to get at the case where it was; having\r\nfinished this business, he turned to come back and, doing so, caught a\r\nglimpse of Sru.\r\n\r\nSru had left the boat and followed him unnoticed. He had been watching\r\nhim through the trees, and must have seen the cache and its contents,\r\nthe piles of boxes and bales of stuff, all half-glimpsed or hinted of\r\nunder the tarpaulin.\r\n\r\nA chill went to Floyd's heart. He remembered Schumer's words and his\r\nwarning against letting any of the labor men land just here. Schumer\r\nhad been so strict that even the Kanaka crew of the _Southern Cross_,\r\nwho had helped to build the house, were never allowed to go beyond a\r\ncertain point. And now Sru had seen everything.\r\n\r\nThe man was walking back to the lagoon edge when Floyd overtook him\r\nwith the tobacco, and Floyd, furious though he was, could say nothing.\r\nSru had broken no orders in following him, and to show any anger now\r\nwould be the worst policy in the world.\r\n\r\nHe got into the dinghy, rowed over to the fishing camp, landed Sru, and\r\nreturned. It seemed to Floyd that the capture of a big pearl always\r\nbrought trouble. The finding of the pink pearl had been followed by the\r\ngoing off of Isbel, and now this had happened.\r\n\r\nHe lit the fire for supper, and then set to prepare the meal. When it\r\nwas over, he sat smoking and watching the starlight on the water of\r\nthe lagoon. Dark ripples were flowing up from the incoming tide, round\r\npoints of light showed here and there, the result of eddies or the\r\nsplash of jumping fish; away, seemingly miles away, the camp fires of\r\nthe pearl fishers showed spark-like in the blue gloom of night.\r\n\r\nThe camp fires fascinated Floyd. Isbel was over there, and over there,\r\nalso, was Sru. Sru, with his yellow-tinged eyes, the scars of old\r\nbattles on his body, night in his heart, and the knowledge of the cache\r\nin his head.\r\n\r\nWhat a fool he had been to disregard Schumer's advice; the wise\r\nSchumer, who foresaw everything, had even seen his--Floyd's--stupidity.\r\n\r\nWell, there was no use in complaining; the thing now was to make\r\npreparation for whatever might happen. The house door was strong and\r\nthe walls, without being loopholed, had convenient spaces--\"ventilation\r\nholes\" Schumer had called them--through which a rifle might be fired.\r\n\r\nHe rose up and, going to the house, lit the lamp and began to overhaul\r\nthe arms and ammunition. This done, he retired to bed with a loaded\r\nrifle by his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE TROUBLE WITH SRU\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the fishing ground next morning, he kept a keen lookout\r\nfor any alteration in Sru.\r\n\r\nSru, however, seemed just the same, and the hands were working as\r\nusual. Timau, wholly recovered now, was working with them, but there\r\nwas no sign of Isbel.\r\n\r\nHe asked Sru where she was, and Sru cast his yellow-whited eyes about\r\nas if in search of her. He opined she might be somewhere in the grove\r\nthat lay to the right of the camping place, and indicated the place\r\nwith his hand. But as Sru spoke with seeming indifference, Floyd\r\nnoticed an expansion of his nostrils and a new light in his eye. It was\r\nas though something had suddenly irritated him.\r\n\r\nThat something could only be Isbel.\r\n\r\nFloyd thought little of the matter. He knew Isbel's ways, and could\r\neasily imagine that her strange nature might give cause for friction\r\nbetween herself and her own people. He set to work and put the thought\r\nof her out of his mind--or fancied that he had done so.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, she was never quite absent from his mind, and he\r\nhad reached the stage now of anger with the Kanakas that she should be\r\nof their blood and living among them as one of them.\r\n\r\nThe strange psychological fact presented itself that though Isbel was a\r\nKanaka, he was beginning to feel toward Kanakas some of that contempt,\r\namounting to dislike, so evident in Schumer. That she who was so\r\ndifferent to these people around him should be of the same blood was,\r\nso to speak, an insult against her.\r\n\r\nSru's savagery and scars, Timau's ugliness--for Timau was a most\r\nunbeautiful type, though, withal, having a certain honestness in\r\nhis plainness, the monkey tricks of the others, and their general\r\nchildishness and fatuity, all these things were a reflection on Isbel.\r\n\r\nAnd she chose to live among them! She had discarded him for them. It\r\nonly wanted that to complete his feelings on the matter.\r\n\r\nBefore he returned to the camping place that night he caught a glimpse\r\nof her. She was down by the lagoon edge, filling a bowl with sea water,\r\nand when he spoke to her she replied to him as usual, yet her manner\r\nwas different. She seemed upset about something. He might have fancied\r\nthat she was sulking, had he not known her so well by unconscious study\r\nof all her moods and expressions. This was not ill temper--as a matter\r\nof fact in all his experience she had never shown ill temper--but\r\nsomething else. She was unhappy. Something had occurred to disturb her\r\nor to frighten her. She seemed cowed, and as she went off with the full\r\nbowl, he was on the point of running after her to seek an explanation.\r\n\r\nBut he checked himself in time. He knew quite well it would be useless,\r\nand he dreaded to give her any cause of offense. Sru most likely had\r\nspoken harshly to her, or she had fallen out with some other member of\r\nthe tribe. It was not for him to interfere in the domestic affairs of\r\nthis strange company, and now for the first time fully he recognized\r\nthe veil of difference that separated him from this race, alien to him\r\nas the people of some other star.\r\n\r\nHe got into the dinghy and returned to the house. It was the evening of\r\nthe new moon, and even as he rowed across the lagoon she showed in the\r\nblue east like a reaper's sickle held up for the sun to look at before\r\nhis setting.\r\n\r\nNever had Floyd felt lonelier than this evening. Isbel seemed suddenly\r\nto have pushed still farther away from him, and the lonely beauty of\r\nthe island under the sunset, and the sickle moon, seemed part of the\r\nnew loneliness that had fallen upon his life.\r\n\r\nHalfway across the lagoon he stopped rowing and put his hand to the\r\npocket in which he carried the pearl box. He had left it behind on a\r\nledge of coral by the working place. It contained the day's take, two\r\nsmall pearls of little value; still, it must be recovered.\r\n\r\nHe turned the boat and rowed back. The hands had all dispersed along\r\nthe reef armed with fish spears, the tide was falling, and there were\r\noften big fish to be got in the rock pools at low tide. Not a soul was\r\nin sight, and, having found the box lying just where he had left it\r\non the ledge of coral, he turned back toward the boat. He had nearly\r\nreached it when a cry from the grove which lay to the left of the\r\ncamping place made him start.\r\n\r\nIt was Isbel's voice. In a moment he was away among the trees, and\r\nthere he found Sru, Sru struggling with Isbel.\r\n\r\nThe thing seemed absurd, absurd as the idea of a child struggling with\r\na tiger, and yet she was holding him off, with no breath now to cry\r\nout, one hand twisted in his long hair, and the other striking at his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nNext moment Floyd had Sru by the throat, half strangling him with a\r\npowerful grip; then, releasing him, he struck out.\r\n\r\nThe blow landed right on the point of the chin, and Sru, felled like an\r\nox under the poleax, crashed into an hibiscus bush and lay without kick\r\nor movement as if he were dead. Floyd turned to Isbel. She had fallen\r\nand half risen, supporting herself with one hand on the ground. She\r\nseemed dazed, like a person who had received a violent blow.\r\n\r\nHe bent down, picked her up, and, holding her in his arms, carried\r\nher down to the boat. He did not worry about Sru; his one thought\r\nwas to get Isbel to a place of safety. If Sru were dead, there would\r\nbe no more trouble over the matter. If, on the contrary, he was only\r\nsuffering from the effects of a knock-out blow, he would certainly seek\r\nvengeance when he recovered. When he placed Isbel in the boat, he found\r\nthat she had lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe sun had not set; it was at the moment of conflict between the\r\nstarlight and the last rays of sunset, the pale sickle of the moon had\r\ngrown to a brilliant orange gold, and the light was strong enough to\r\nbrighten the lagoon water.\r\n\r\nArrived at the beach, he stepped out, and, lifting Isbel in his arms,\r\ncarried her up to the house. She was no longer unconscious, and, as he\r\ncarried her, he felt her arm clasped round his neck. It was as though\r\nshe were accepting his protection and thanking him at the same time.\r\n\r\nArrived at the house, he placed her on the bunk mattress upon which he\r\nalways slept, lit the lamp, and knelt down beside her. \"You'll stay\r\nhere now, Isbel,\" said he; \"you will not run away from me any more,\r\nwill you? I've been pretty lonely without you, but I did not mind so\r\nlong as I thought you were happy with your own people. You see how they\r\nhave treated you----\"\r\n\r\nShe raised herself on her elbow and looked into his face, the lamplight\r\nstruck her hair and forehead, while he saw nothing for the moment, and\r\nknew of nothing, but the brown depths of her eyes, so close to him, so\r\nmysterious, so luminous--yet so dark.\r\n\r\n\"I will stay,\" said she. \"I did not know you before. I know you now.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and she let him hold it for a moment. It was the first\r\ntime that hand had been in his, a hand firm, yet soft, subtle, yet\r\ncapable, warm as life itself. Then he released it and rose up. There\r\nwas grim business to be attended to, and as he fetched the two rifles\r\nand their ammunition from the adjoining room, the feeling came to him\r\nthat up to this he had never really lived, but had only existed as a\r\nspectator of life. Here was life raw and real, the battle for existence\r\nand love and everything worth having; the supreme moment which many of\r\nus never know.\r\n\r\nHe placed the rifles on the table and the ammunition beside them, and\r\nthen went back and fetched the revolvers. When he returned, he found\r\nthat Isbel had left the mattress and was standing by the table, with\r\none hand resting on it, and her eyes fixed on him.\r\n\r\n\"These are for Sru if he comes with any of those fellows behind him,\"\r\nsaid Floyd. \"It's as well to be prepared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Schumer showed me how,\" said she, \"before you came here--long before.\r\nLook----\" She opened the breech of one of the Winchesters, extracted\r\nthe cartridges, and put them back. \"Then you fire--so.\" She put the\r\nrifle to her shoulder and took aim at some imaginary object, then,\r\nlowering it, she turned to him, and for the first time she smiled.\r\n\r\nHer eyes lit with a new light, her little teeth shone, it was as\r\nthough something bright and fierce, some unknown spirit, dwelling in\r\nher nature, had suddenly peeped out. He recalled the day when they had\r\nsmashed the bottles on the reef, and she had assisted, laughing at the\r\ndestruction. She had not smiled, she had laughed, little short laughs\r\nsharp as the thrusts of a stabbing spear.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Floyd, \"you know how to use a gun. Well, that's all the\r\nbetter. If they come to make any trouble, we will be able to give them\r\nsomething they won't like, you and I.\"\r\n\r\n\"You and I,\" said Isbel, with the same smile. Then, suddenly, she\r\npressed her little white teeth on her under lip.\r\n\r\nShe placed the rifle back on the table, and, turning, left the house by\r\nthe open door.\r\n\r\nFloyd looked after her, wondering what had happened now. He finished\r\nthe examination of the rifles and revolvers, and then, leaving them\r\nupon the table, came outside.\r\n\r\nIsbel was lighting the fire to prepare supper for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE ATTACK\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night he made her sleep in the house, while he took his place\r\noutside. He arranged to call her when half the night was over, so that\r\nshe might keep watch while he slept, and as he sat with his back to the\r\nhouse wall, and a loaded rifle by his side, he tried to forecast the\r\npossibility of an attack and the upshot, should it occur.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Sru had seen the cache weighed with him as much as the\r\noccurrence of that evening. The two facts combined made the position\r\nvery, very threatening. The labor men had no arms and ammunition, but\r\nthey were thirty in number; they had no boat, but they had the raft,\r\nand though the reef was almost impassable, Isbel had got along it\r\nthat night of her flight, and what she had done, these fellows could\r\ndoubtless accomplish also.\r\n\r\nHe could see the sparks of the camp fires away across the lagoon, but\r\nthough the wind was blowing from over there, it brought no sound on it.\r\nUsually one could catch stray snatches of song from across the water,\r\nor the fellows shouting as they speared fish in the rock pools by\r\ntorchlight.\r\n\r\nTo-night the silence seemed ominous, and the light of the camp fires\r\nlike threatening eyes. Now and again would come the splash of a fish,\r\nand now and again the wind breezing up for a moment would set the\r\nfoliage moving in the grove, the breadfruit leaves clapping like great\r\ngreen hands, and the palm fronds rustling and cheeping.\r\n\r\nThe surf on the outer reef was low of sound to-night, yet,\r\noccasionally, over to the west, where the full trend of the swell was\r\nmeeting the coral, it would speak louder and become angry like the\r\nsound of a train at full speed.\r\n\r\nEven the stars had taken on the aspect of attention; they seemed\r\nwatching and waiting to see something that would surely occur.\r\n\r\nFloyd had to get up and pace the sands to break the spell. Then, after\r\na while, he sat down again. The fires over at the fishing camp had died\r\nout, the wind had fallen to the merest breath, and the surf on the\r\nwestern reef no longer snarled.\r\n\r\nDanger seemed to have drawn away from the island, leaving behind her\r\nthe profoundest peace. Floyd, whose eyes were longing to close despite\r\nall his efforts to keep awake, felt a touch on his shoulder. It was\r\nIsbel come to relieve guard. When he came out next morning, the sun was\r\nup, and Isbel had lit the fire and was preparing breakfast.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to the meal together, and, when it was over, Floyd\r\ndeclared his intention of going, as usual, to the fishery.\r\n\r\n\"We must keep the work going, at all costs,\" said he. \"If I did not,\r\nthey would think I was afraid, and then they would be sure to attack\r\nus. Besides, there may be nothing to fear. Sru is the only one I care\r\nabout, the others are pretty harmless, with no one to lead them, and\r\nSru may be knocked out. He looked pretty dead when I left him.\"\r\n\r\nIsbel shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"One blow would not kill Sru,\" said she. \"Too strong. If you go, I go\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You,\" said Floyd. \"And suppose--suppose they attack us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you go alone and get killed,\" said Isbel, \"what become of me\r\nhere alone? No, I go if you go. I can shoot. I stay in the boat to keep\r\nit safe, whiles you go to the fishing. If they come to take the boat,\r\nI kill them. If they strike at you, I kill them. You don't know me. I\r\nknow myself. I have no fear at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you,\" said he. \"Yes, we will go together; you are worth half\r\na dozen men----Isbel, why did you run away from me that time?\"\r\n\r\nIsbel looked down.\r\n\r\n\"I went to find my own people,\" said she at last. \"I was afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Afraid of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Isbel; \"you and Schumer, and being alone with you\r\nmade me afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are not afraid any longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"With you I am not any more afraid,\" said Isbel, speaking with\r\ndifficulty, and drawing a little pattern on the sand with her finger\r\ntip. Then, looking up: \"Not even with Schumer, if you were there.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd was about to take her hand, but he restrained himself.\r\n\r\n\"That is good,\" said he. \"You need never have been afraid of me. I care\r\nfor you too much to let any one hurt you, and that morning when I came\r\nout of the house and found you gone, when I searched in the grove and\r\nalong the reef and could not see you and thought you might be drowned\r\nand that I would never see you again, the world seemed no use any\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet as if to check his words, and walked off to the\r\nhouse, leaving Isbel still seated on the sand, and still drawing the\r\npattern with her finger.\r\n\r\nHe returned with one of the Winchester rifles under his arm, a revolver\r\nin his hand, and one in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIsbel rose, and, going down to the lagoon edge, they pushed the dinghy\r\noff, got in, and started for the fishing camp. As they drew near they\r\nsaw that the fishing was going on apparently as usual, and the first\r\nperson to greet them on the beach was Sru.\r\n\r\nThere were all the elements for a strained situation, but Sru showed\r\nno sign of the incident of the day before, and when Floyd stepped\r\nout on the sand, nodded his head as usual, and grumbled something in\r\nhis throat that seemed intended for a welcome. But his eye lit on\r\nthe Winchester Isbel propped against the seat of the dinghy, and it\r\ndoubtless took in, also, the revolver butt sticking from Floyd's coat\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nThe seeming indifference of Sru to what had happened struck Floyd as\r\nalmost uncanny; then, as they set to work, he let the matter drop from\r\nhis mind. If it satisfied Sru to take a thrashing and say nothing,\r\nit satisfied Floyd's policy to let the matter drop. The man had been\r\npunished for his misdeed, and the incident was closed, for the present\r\nat least.\r\n\r\nNow Schumer would undoubtedly have tried the man and shot him offhand,\r\nnot only for the attack on Isbel, but to safeguard the little colony.\r\nFloyd, though just as courageous as Schumer at a pinch, and probably\r\nmore so, was incapable of acting the part of executioner. He could not\r\nkill a man in cold blood.\r\n\r\nSo he worked side by side with the yellow-eyed one, and as the labor\r\nwent on he forgot more and more the danger of the situation, but he\r\nmight have noticed, had he turned, that Isbel, who had taken her seat\r\non the sand by the boat, never left her position for a moment, and that\r\nposition enabled her, if need arose, to stretch out her arm and seize\r\nthe Winchester that was propped against the seat of the dinghy.\r\n\r\nNeither would she have anything to say to the fellows who were diving.\r\nThe raft came several times ashore to discharge shell, and some of the\r\nhands drew close to her, but she told them to clear off.\r\n\r\nFloyd heard her voice once or twice hard and sharp, a quite new voice\r\nfor her. He could not tell what she said, but he noticed that none of\r\nthe fellows approached her.\r\n\r\nSome of them, as far as he could judge, seemed deriding her just as\r\nschoolboys joke at one of their number who has made himself unpopular,\r\nbut they kept their distance.\r\n\r\nAt the dinner hour shortly before noon, the whole crowd of the labor\r\nmen, joined by Sru, drew off to a spot close to the tents, and,\r\nsquatting in a ring, set to on their food.\r\n\r\nWork was always knocked off in the middle of the day, Floyd returning\r\nto the house for a siesta. He came now toward Isbel, intending to help\r\nher to push the dinghy off, but instead of rising, she made him sit\r\ndown beside her.\r\n\r\n\"See them,\" said she. \"They sit all together and like that.\" She made a\r\nring on the sand with her finger. \"I go and hear what they say if you\r\nwait. It is no good when they sit like that all together and talk while\r\nthey eat----Wait!\"\r\n\r\nShe rose up and walked along the beach edge, picking up shells. Then\r\nshe drew close to the grove and vanished into it. Some of the tents\r\nwere situated close up to the grove, and the hands were seated eating\r\nand talking close to the tent. They looked after Isbel as she was\r\nwalking along the beach edge. When she disappeared, they seemed to\r\nforget her, and went on with their palaver. Floyd waited. Five minutes\r\nlater he saw the form of the girl away out from among the trees. She\r\nwalked right down to the edge of the lagoon, and then came along toward\r\nFloyd, still picking up an occasional shell.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached him she showed him the shells.\r\n\r\n\"No good,\" said she. \"But look at them so they may see.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd handled the shells and pretended to admire them; then she placed\r\nthem in the dinghy and they pushed her off.\r\n\r\nIt was not till they reached the middle of the lagoon that she told of\r\nwhat she had done, and what she had heard.\r\n\r\nShe had crept through the grove to the back of one of the tents, and\r\nlistened to the chatter that had come clearly heard on the slight wind\r\nthat was blowing toward the grove.\r\n\r\nSomething was afoot, and whatever they were going to do was to be done\r\nthat night. From what Isbel gathered, an attack was to be made on them,\r\nand the attackers would cross the lagoon on the raft.\r\n\r\nFloyd, who was rowing, pulled in his sculls.\r\n\r\n\"The raft,\" said he. \"I never thought of that. They can get twenty\r\nchaps on to it. We must stop this. It is going to be war anyhow, so we\r\nmay as well strike first.\"\r\n\r\nHe told Isbel the fear that had suddenly occurred to him, and she\r\nlaughed. Then taking to the sculls again, he rowed on as hard as he\r\ncould, till they reached their destination.\r\n\r\nLeaving Isbel to look after the dinghy, he ran up to the house and came\r\nback with a hammer, a big nail, and a coil of rope. Then they pushed\r\noff again, making for the fishing camp. The raft, when not in use, was\r\nmoored by a rope to a spur of coral jutting out from the sand.\r\n\r\nAs they approached, they could see the labor men still seated at their\r\npow-wow. Heads were turned as the dinghy drew near to the raft, but not\r\na man moved till Isbel, with a rifle in one hand and a knife in the\r\nother, cut the mooring rope.\r\n\r\nThen a yell rose up, and the whole crowd, rising like one man, came\r\nracing down to the water's edge, picking up stones as they ran, while\r\nsome of them, turning, made off for the fish spears in the tents.\r\n\r\nWhile Isbel had been cutting the rope, Floyd, with three blows of the\r\nhammer, had driven the big nail into one of the logs, tied the rope to\r\nit, tied the other end of the rope to the rings in the stern of the\r\ndinghy, and was now sculling for his life. The heavy raft moved slowly,\r\nand the crowd on shore, held up for a moment by the water, were just\r\ntaking to it when Isbel's rifle rang out, and the foremost of them,\r\nhit through the shoulder, sat down with a yell on the sand. The rush\r\nwas broken for a moment, and Floyd, as he tugged at the sculls, saw a\r\nsight that would have made him laugh, had he been watching from a place\r\nof safety.\r\n\r\nThe balked ones literally danced on the sands. Fury drove them, but\r\nfright held them, and the dance was the result till the fellows with\r\nthe fish spears made their appearance, racing down from the tents.\r\n\r\nFloyd instantly put the dinghy alongside the raft, and, springing on to\r\nit, took the rifle from the girl, while she, getting into the dinghy,\r\ntook the sculls and went on with the towing.\r\n\r\nFloyd dropped the first spearman twenty paces from the water's edge,\r\nand he fell on his belly, while the spear slithered along the beach.\r\n\r\nThe second spearman, struck fair in the forehead, flung out his arms\r\nand fell on his back. The spear, striking the sand with its butt, stood\r\nupright and quivering, the point, still dark with fish blood, impotent\r\nand pointing to the sky.\r\n\r\nIt was enough for the others. They broke and ran, and, as they ran,\r\nFloyd fired on them, catching one fellow through the leg and knocking a\r\ntuft of hair off another's head.\r\n\r\nIn thirty seconds the beach was clear.\r\n\r\nFloyd through it all had acted almost automatically and as if firing at\r\na target. The whole business seemed strangely impersonal and unreal.\r\nThat he should be standing there, killing men like flies, seemed part\r\nof the everyday business of life, and yet, at the back of his mind,\r\nsomething was crying out against it all, a voice small as though it had\r\ntraveled from a thousand miles away, and without substance or sound or\r\nweight in effect on his mind.\r\n\r\nHe stood with the taste of the cartridge smoke in his mouth, staring\r\nat the beach, while from behind him he could hear the sound of the\r\nsculls in the rowlocks as Isbel strained at the oars.\r\n\r\nThey were now well out from the shore, and he took his place in the\r\nboat at the sculls, while Isbel got on the raft.\r\n\r\nThe beach they were leaving was all trodden up, and the bodies of the\r\ntwo dead men lay, one huddled up as though he were asleep, the other\r\nspread-eagled and looking like a brown starfish, the spear he had been\r\ncarrying so valiantly standing beside him, barb pointing to the sky.\r\n\r\nThe light wind was blowing the dry sand in little eddies, and under\r\nthe blazing sunlight the salt white beach and the emerald shallows of\r\nthe lagoon made a dazzling picture. Nothing could seem farther removed\r\nfrom death or the thought of death than this brilliant scene, where the\r\nslain were lying unburied and Death himself was watching from the grove\r\nof trees that formed its background.\r\n\r\nIsbel stood on the raft as he towed it, her hand shading her eyes, her\r\ngaze fixed on the shore.\r\n\r\nFloyd, recalling her horror of the hanging and the effect it produced\r\nupon her, could not help wondering at her attitude now, till he\r\nremembered the difference between the cold-blooded execution of a man\r\nand the killing of a man in self-defense.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the middle of the lagoon, she turned from gazing\r\nat the shore and sat down on the raft. They did not speak to one\r\nanother till the dinghy was landed and the raft moored by a long rope\r\nwhich they tied to one of the seats of the quarter boat, which was\r\nlying high and dry on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Floyd, when this was finished, \"we are in for it now,\r\nIsbel, you and I. These fellows won't sit down and do nothing, or, if\r\nthey do, I am greatly mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Isbel, \"they will try to kill us.\" She said it quite simply,\r\nas though she were talking of some matter of little moment.\r\n\r\n\"And we'll try to stop them,\" said Floyd, with a laugh. It is the sign\r\nmark of the Anglo-Saxon and Celts and all breeds that spring from their\r\nmixture, that they go laughing into battle, die jesting, and carve\r\ntheir enemies with epigrams as well as swords; battle brings a levity\r\nof spirit that in its turn brings victory, and Floyd, now that war was\r\ndeclared, moved lightly and felt a liveliness at heart such as he had\r\nnot experienced since boyhood.\r\n\r\nHe had destroyed the enemy's fleet, but he had not destroyed their land\r\nforces, and worse than all, he had not put their general out of action.\r\n\r\nSru was still alive, and he was more dangerous than all the others.\r\n\r\nWhen the firing had begun, Sru had flung himself flat on his stomach on\r\nthe sand, and from that position had yelled his orders. It was evident\r\nthat he was the directing spirit of the whole business, and it was\r\nnearly certain that he would not take defeat lying down.\r\n\r\nThe weak position of the house as a defensive stronghold lay in its\r\nproximity to the grove and the fact that it did not command the\r\napproach to this bit of the island by way of the reef. The back of the\r\nbuilding was close up to the trees, and, though there were chinks that\r\nmade good loopholes for firing through, the trees, and especially\r\ntheir shadow by night, gave good cover for an attacking party.\r\n\r\nThen there was the prospect of a siege. Floyd, taking his seat on the\r\nsand in the shade of the trees, called to Isbel to sit down beside him.\r\n\r\nThen they held a council of war.\r\n\r\n\"How many fish spears have those fellows got, Isbel?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Many,\" replied Isbel. \"They were making them a long time ago--too many\r\nfor fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean they were made for the purpose of attacking us--I mean, of\r\nattacking me, for you were with them then?\"\r\n\r\nIsbel nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I did not know. I thought then it was for the fishing. Now\r\nI know better. It was Sru who told them to make more spears, and they\r\nwould all get together and talk. I had no feeling at all that it was\r\nwrong, else I would have listened. But now I see it all.\"\r\n\r\nThis cast even a darker light on Sru. He must have been plotting all\r\nalong and from the first. Plotting to seize Isbel for himself, kill the\r\nonly white man on the place, and seize all the valuables he could find.\r\nThat was doubtless his plan of campaign. As to the far future, and how\r\nhe was to escape from the island and from punishment, he was unlikely\r\nto have made any plan. The savage view is a short view, and is mainly\r\noccupied by immediate desires and the means of gratifying them. It is\r\nonly the trained intelligence that forecasts and lays plans only to be\r\ncarried out in the far future.\r\n\r\nSru wanted Isbel, and tobacco more than he could use, knives for which\r\nhe had no use, firearms to glut his desire for lethal weapons, printed\r\ncotton, and the satisfaction of the lust to kill. He most likely\r\npromised himself Floyd served up roasted in plantain leaves, for he\r\nbelonged to the man-eating order of Solomanders. So in his dark mind he\r\nhad constructed a scheme for getting these things and satisfying these\r\ndesires, and had carried out his scheme while working in amity with the\r\nman he intended to destroy.\r\n\r\nHis military genius had not proved itself on a par with his genius for\r\nvillainy, but he had the numbers, while Floyd only had the rifles, for\r\nrifles, even though they be Winchesters, firing five shots apiece, are\r\nof limited use without men behind them.\r\n\r\nFrom the edge of the grove bordering the rough coral of the reef a good\r\nlookout could be kept toward the fishing ground. From here the lagoon,\r\nexclusive of the segment, including the reef opening, could be watched.\r\n\r\nOne could see the fishing camp and the whole of the roof leading from\r\nit. Standing here, one could command with a rifle all that strip of\r\nrough and broken coral that made a natural defense, and along which an\r\nattacking force must come, if it wished to reach the house by land.\r\n\r\nFloyd determined that this was the point where watch must be kept by\r\nnight. The coral, though rough and sharp here and there as knives,\r\nwas not impassable to a determined foe. Isbel had got along it that\r\ntime she ran away, and these fellows, with foot soles like leather and\r\nnerves insensitive to cuts and falls, could do what she had done.\r\n\r\nHe posted Isbel now to keep watch, while, going back to the house, he\r\nmade preparations for a possible siege.\r\n\r\nTaking the tarpaulin from the cache, he made a collection of all the\r\ntinned food that came first to hand. There were two bags of ship's\r\nbread still left, and these, with the tins of bully beef, potatoes,\r\nand so forth, he carried to the house. Then he filled two of the water\r\nbeakers at the well and placed them in the main room of the building.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered the albini rifles. These, with their ammunition,\r\nwere stored separately, and the conveyance of them would have meant\r\na considerable amount of labor and time. He took only the ammunition\r\nwhich was made up in four large parcels. These he carted down to the\r\ndinghy, rowed her out into five fathom of water, and dumped the parcels\r\nin the lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the lagoon where he dumped them was pretty rough coral,\r\nso they would not be shifted much by the tide, and could be fished up\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nHaving completed all these preparations, he rejoined Isbel at the\r\nlookout post.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon now, and neither of them had eaten\r\nanything since morning, so he sent Isbel to the house to get some food,\r\nand, taking his seat with his back to a tree, waited her return.\r\n\r\nAlone like this, he sat with his eyes fixed on the enemy's country, on\r\nthe lookout for any sign of movement on their part. He had brought the\r\ntelescope with him, and used it now and then without effect. Through\r\nit he could see the fishing beach and the bodies still lying upon it,\r\nthe spear, sticking upright from the sand, the trodden-up sand, and the\r\ndeserted tents. That was all. There was no sign of the enemy, who were\r\nno doubt hiding in the grove behind the tents, or on the reef beyond\r\nthe grove.\r\n\r\nHe argued that they must have been considerably scared to have effaced\r\nthemselves in this fashion, yet he knew enough of savages to prevent\r\nhim from building too much on moral effect. They might be scared now,\r\nbut the effect would wear off, and the desire for revenge and blood and\r\nloot reassert itself. Even now, though they were in hiding, they were\r\ndoubtless holding a powwow, with Sru as chairman.\r\n\r\nThe position was bad. The pearl fishing had ceased, the island was\r\nin a state of war, there could be no peace or parleying with the\r\nenemy simply because there could be no trust placed in them while Sru\r\nwas alive and active. At best, they could hold their own only by a\r\ncontinuous watch and defensive until Schumer returned. But Schumer\r\nmight be delayed; he might never come back, the _Southern Cross_ might\r\neven now be lying at the bottom of the Pacific, or hove up on some reef\r\na thousand miles away from the Island of Pearls. As this thought came\r\nto him, he cast his eyes across the great space of sea visible on the\r\nocean side of the reef. The sea, in the late afternoon light, lay calm\r\nbut for the gentle swell that heaved it shoreward, but he knew well the\r\ntreachery of that sea, of all seas the most fair--and faithless.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused from his thoughts by Isbel, who had returned, bringing\r\nhim some food. She had also brought with her a rifle and some more\r\nammunition. As she stood with the gun in her hand, gazing over toward\r\nthe fishing camp, Floyd watched her, wondering at the change in her\r\nand the difference between this figure and the Isbel he had known at\r\nfirst--the girl he had seen that day of his first landing on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nEven during the last couple of days she had changed. Nothing makes for\r\nthe development of the best and the worst in us like war. The struggle\r\nfor existence, brought to a flaming point, is the true fire assay for\r\ncharacter. Not only does the human soul develop in this ordeal, but the\r\nhuman being ages. Isbel, since the morning of the day before, seemed a\r\nyear older, and Floyd's boyish character had taken on a sternness and\r\nreceived a solidification that ten years of ordinary life might not\r\nhave effected.\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him, and they ate the food she had brought, talking\r\nlittle, and each ever on the watch for any movement of the enemy. There\r\nwas nothing. Nothing but the gulls flying in the blue, and the waves\r\nbreaking on the coral and the wind moving the foliage of the distant\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe island might have been deserted but for their presence and those\r\nbrown spots lying on the sand of the distant beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT FIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nNo fires were lit on the fishing beach that evening, nor did the wind\r\nfrom across the lagoon bring any sound of singing from the fishermen.\r\n\r\nFloyd remained at the lookout post while Isbel, returning to the house,\r\nput everything in order and gave a last touch to the defenses and a\r\nlast look around. Then she returned and took her place beside him.\r\n\r\nThe moon, stronger to-night, yellow and brilliant, hung in the\r\napple-green dusk of the eastern sky. It looked exactly like the quarter\r\nof a crystallized orange; then, as the sky steadily and swiftly\r\ndarkened, it lost its yellow tinge and became a sickle of frosted\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThe light was powerful enough to sparkle up the whole lagoon and show\r\nthe reef like a curving gray road set on either side with the lagoon\r\nwater and the foam of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe fishing beach showed clearly, and the grove, even the tents could\r\nbe made out as gray flecks against the darkness of the trees, but sign\r\nof life there was none.\r\n\r\n\"I would like it better if we could see more of them,\" said Floyd.\r\n\"They are a lot too quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will come to-night, I think,\" said Isbel. \"They are hiding now\r\nand talking. Sru will lead them.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd laughed. \"He led them finely on the beach over there this\r\nafternoon,\" said he, \"lying on his stomach all the time!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is why I fear him,\" said Isbel. \"He is very clever; the others\r\nare not clever, but they are good to fight. Sru is the head; they are\r\nthe hands. Sru is a devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not know what Sru was that time you left me and went back to\r\nthem,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Isbel; \"I thought he was good then. He said to me: 'Why\r\nnot come back to your own people?' The words he said to me grew in my\r\nmind like seeds in the ground. I did not know you then. I thought you\r\nwere the same as Schumer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Isbel, \"I know you now.\"\r\n\r\nHe could see her profile against the stars and the line of her\r\ndelicately shaped head. She was sitting with her hands about her knees,\r\nin just the same position as on the day when, drawing near the beach,\r\nSchumer had stood to receive him, and Isbel had sat watching, seemingly\r\nindifferent, gazing at him with those eyes whose gaze held so much of\r\nthe unknown.\r\n\r\nShe wore a flower in her hair that day, and she wore a flower in her\r\nhair to-night, a perfumed blossom plucked as she was passing through\r\nthe grove. The scent of it came to him with a trace of the hot,\r\ngorse-like perfume of her hair, and for a moment he forgot Sru, the\r\nisland, the fight on the beach, and the whole desperate position. For a\r\nmoment only. As they sat beneath the stars, watching the moonlight grow\r\nstronger upon the lagoon water and the reef, suddenly from away out\r\nthere came a cry like the sudden clamoring of sea fowl. A sound fierce\r\nand sharp and with the ring of triumph in it. The invisibility of the\r\nenemy and the absolute silence they had maintained up till now lent the\r\nsound a weird significance.\r\n\r\n\"They are starting,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nIsbel nodded. She said nothing; she was listening. Then she said: \"They\r\nwill have been talking, all sitting round as they were to-day. Sru will\r\nhave been making plans to come here and kill us. Then when all their\r\nminds went together like men with spears they shouted like that and\r\njumped to their feet and started.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke like a person who was watching it all in some magic glass,\r\nslowly and in a dreamy manner and with a detachment as though what she\r\nwere viewing had nothing to do with them.\r\n\r\n\"They'll start more before I have done with them,\" said Floyd viciously.\r\n\r\nThe events of the day, the tension of waiting, and that shout, cruel as\r\na barbed spear coming out of the night, had raised the fierce fighting\r\nspirit of his race, a spirit all the more potent and terrible from the\r\nunderlying sobriety that tempers its fierceness and levity.\r\n\r\n\"It's funny to think we may be knocked out before the sun rises again,\"\r\nsaid he. \"What do you think happens to a man when he's dead, Isbel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It is, I think, all the same as before he is born. He\r\ndoesn't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I have often thought myself,\" said he. \"Look! What is\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nAway toward the far end of the reef they saw moving points upon the\r\ncoral. Huge insects seemed crawling here and there, aimlessly at\r\nfirst, and now approaching nearer.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming,\" said Floyd, seizing a rifle. \"They are spreading\r\nthemselves out, and that confounded coral gives them good sheltering\r\nplaces. We must stop them if possible.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood up, and, putting the rifle to his shoulder, aimed it at the\r\nnearest moving spot and fired. He continued blazing away till the\r\nchambers were empty. The movement ceased, but almost immediately it\r\nrecommenced, and now they could see the brown figures crouching and\r\ncrawling, spread out fanwise, taking cover at every projection, and\r\nalways advancing closer.\r\n\r\nIt was almost impossible to fire effectively, owing to the uncertain\r\nlight and the fact that at the first flash every figure fell flat or\r\ndodged behind cover.\r\n\r\nBetween the rough coral and the point where they stood lay forty yards\r\nor so of smooth ground, across which the final rush would be made.\r\n\r\n\"It seems we can't stop them,\" said Floyd as he emptied the contents of\r\nthe second rifle, while the girl reloaded, \"and once they get near the\r\nedge of that smooth bit they'll rush us. Get everything together when I\r\ngive the word and make back for the house. Ah, I had one then!\"\r\n\r\nA shriek following the shot he had just fired told of a hit, but\r\nit did not stop the advance. On the contrary, the wretches had now\r\nreached the psychological point, the point where instinct told them\r\ncollectively that a rush must surely succeed, and where optimism told\r\nthem individually that it was the next man who would be hit.\r\n\r\nThey left cover boldly, and, heedless of the rough coral, of the\r\npitfalls and sharp edges, leaped to the attack like bounding kangaroos.\r\n\r\nFloyd bagged two of them with his two last shots; then calling to\r\nIsbel, who had also been firing, he led the way through the trees\r\ntoward the house.\r\n\r\nIsbel, with forethought, had lit the lamp in the main room, and the\r\nglow of it shining through the loopholes in the walls showed them their\r\nway. Once inside, they barred the door, placed the guns on the table,\r\nand began to reload.\r\n\r\nThey did not speak a word. Coolly and swiftly they shoved the\r\ncartridges in their places, and then, each with a rifle, stood at\r\nattention to the hell of voices from outside.\r\n\r\nNever could Floyd have believed that human beings were capable of such\r\nsounds of ferocity and malevolence. Only in the long boo-hoo of the\r\nstorm that had torn the bones of the _Tonga_ to pieces had he heard\r\nanything like this outburst.\r\n\r\nFists and feet were thundering at the door, spear points poking through\r\nthe openings in the walls, but all that was nothing to the uproar of\r\nthe voices. The calling of monkeys and the shrieks of parrots seemed\r\nmixed with the howl of hyenas, and more terrible than these came an\r\nincessant, fierce whistling, harsh as the whistling of steam.\r\n\r\nFloyd was less a philosopher than a man of action, yet even so, and\r\nthough he had no time for philosophy in such a crisis, his mind for a\r\nmoment was held by one stupendous fact--these fiends storming the house\r\nwere not devils just let loose from the infernal regions; they were the\r\n\"hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe men he had worked with and overseen, pleasant and childlike\r\ncreatures full of fun and laughter, most of them. It is true that many\r\nof them had, when in repose, that hard, set expression which seems to\r\nhave come from ages of watching across the sun blaze on the sea, but\r\ntheir faces could express good humor, one might say, fluently, and as\r\nthey had always been well treated on the island they had never cause to\r\nexpress anything else.\r\n\r\nWhen Floyd had seen them first on the day that he and Schumer had\r\nboarded the _Southern Cross_ they had struck him as a very hard lot,\r\nand a good deal of that expression had come from the shell nose rings\r\nand the slit ear lobes distinguishing most of them; as he got to\r\nknow them better that impression became less vivid. Yet it had been\r\nthe right one. The shell nose rings and split ear lobes were surely\r\n\"features\" inasmuch as they spoke of ages and ages of savagery, blood,\r\nand darkness.\r\n\r\nYet the second impression had been right in its way. Despite all their\r\nsavagery these people were human, had in them a certain bonhomie and\r\nsense of humor, and possessed many of those traits which we associate\r\nwith the word \"gentleman.\" The latter curious fact had been impressed\r\non Floyd several times in his dealings with them. Sru, for instance,\r\nthe worst of the lot, though he had probably dined off his enemy in his\r\ntime, and though he had planned and plotted murder, would not have hurt\r\nyour feelings for the world by word or gesture. Floyd, having reloaded,\r\ndisregarding the door toward which the main attack seemed directed,\r\nchose loopholes near the ones through which the spear points were being\r\nthrust, and fired with effect, to judge by the sounds that followed\r\nthe shots. Isbel, crawling and creeping close to the walls, seized on\r\nthe spear shafts, and, using all her weight, broke them off.\r\n\r\nShe managed to break three like this, and then returned to the loading.\r\nDark, cool, swift, and absolutely fearless, she seemed in these\r\nmad minutes the very spirit of destruction. They had ammunition in\r\nabundance, and when she was not engaged in reloading for Floyd she\r\nused one of the revolvers herself. The smoke of the firing blown back\r\nthrough the loopholes made a haze round the steadily burning lamp, near\r\nwhich, from the ceiling, a big spider was swinging from his thread,\r\nlaying his nets utterly undisturbed by the sounds and fumes of the\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nThen gradually the attack died down. The gentry outside had exhausted\r\nthemselves mostly by yelling; they had done no damage and had received\r\nseveral injuries. Had they possessed a single firearm they might\r\nhave made the position untenable, but they had nothing, and they\r\nhad evidently come to recognize the fact that poking spears through\r\nloopholes was useless work, besides being dangerous.\r\n\r\nFloyd wiped his brow with his coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"The fools have never thought of forcing the door,\" said he; \"they\r\nmight have done it with that crowbar. You remember the piece of iron I\r\nused to break open the big clamshell. They never thought of that. They\r\ncame with spears only, and there is nothing over on this side they can\r\nuse to force the door with. Let's hope they won't remember about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" said Isbel.\r\n\r\nSounds were coming from the grove at the back of the house, sounds\r\nmore of a jubilant than a warlike nature.\r\n\r\nFloyd knitted his brow; then his face cleared.\r\n\r\n\"I know what it is,\" said he. \"They have got at the cache.\"\r\n\r\nThe fragment of moon low down in the west lit the beach, and very soon\r\nFloyd's suspicion was justified. Peeping through the loopholes of the\r\nfront wall, they saw the whole band of the enemy debouching on the\r\nsands away to the left, and every man laden with loot.\r\n\r\nSome were carrying bolts of cloth, and others cases of provisions and\r\nboxes of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThey thought themselves beyond rifle range, and, like children, they\r\nwanted to examine their treasures. Floyd, assured that none of them had\r\nremained behind, opened the door, and, rifle in hand, stood watching\r\nthem. Then he opened fire, and they scattered, leaving their treasures\r\non the sand. Some ran along the lagoon edge, toward the reef opening;\r\none dashed right into the water and swam in the same direction, while\r\nthe main body made back for the shelter of the grove.\r\n\r\nNot one of them was hit as far as he could see, and the men who had\r\nmade toward the reef opening would return by the seaward side of the\r\nreef.\r\n\r\n\"I almost wish I had left them alone,\" said he. \"It will only make them\r\nmore vicious. The sight of that stuff lying there will keep them going.\r\nHowever, it is too late to bother now.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned back to the house and shut the door. He had been speaking to\r\nIsbel, and fancied her to be just behind him. She was not. She was at\r\nthe table, quietly preparing some food. He noticed now for the first\r\ntime that the flower was still in her hair. It looked dark purple in\r\nthe lamplight. And now for a moment a strange sensation stole over\r\nhim, as though the whole of the business were a fantastic dream, a\r\nsensation of unreality that infected even his own being. It passed,\r\nand, coming to the table where the food was now lying beside the rifles\r\nand ammunition, he drew one of the chairs up and sat down sideways to\r\nthe board.\r\n\r\nIsbel remained standing, and as they ate they talked, and what they\r\nsaid had little to do with the main business in hand. It was not\r\na thing to be talked about. The situation was hopeless, if ever a\r\nsituation was hopeless, and no plan had yet appeared to either of them\r\nby which their position could be bettered.\r\n\r\nIdeas had come to Floyd only to be dismissed as useless, the idea, for\r\ninstance, of making a dash from the house and taking to the dinghy,\r\nwhich they could easily push off. That would not help them in the\r\nleast, since there was no place of safety to which the dinghy could\r\ntake them. Their assailants would not expose themselves to rifle fire\r\nby day, and by night they would attack as they had done before.\r\n\r\nThe only spot where they could put up a defense for any time would be\r\nthe pierhead at the break on the opposite side of the reef, and there\r\nthey would be cut off from all food supplies.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good thing we have plenty of food here and water,\" said Floyd.\r\n\"We have water enough for a week and food for a fortnight. I expect\r\nthose fellows will get back to the fishing camp to-morrow and leave us\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nHe said it for the sake of saying something, but Isbel shook her head.\r\nShe knew the men they had to deal with.\r\n\r\n\"They will never leave us till we kill them or they kill us,\" said she,\r\nclearing the things from the table. \"Or,\" she finished, \"till we kill\r\nSru.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Floyd, \"he's the center of the whole business. Well, we\r\nwill do our best to nail him.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose up and went to one of the loopholes by the door. Peeping\r\nthrough, he could see the trade goods still lying on the sands, but not\r\na sign of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disturbing things in this fight was the manner in\r\nwhich the attackers would suddenly efface themselves, as after the\r\nfirst fight over on the fishing beach. They had vanished now as though\r\nannihilated, leaving neither outpost nor sign to hint of what plan they\r\nmight be brewing.\r\n\r\nThe moon was very low down over the western reef. It was close to dawn,\r\nand soon the sun would be flooding the world with light. If another\r\nattack was in preparation it would not be long delayed, yet not a sound\r\ncame to indicate an approach to the house.\r\n\r\n\"All the same they will come,\" said Isbel, \"and they will come before\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\" asked Floyd.\r\n\r\nIsbel nodded. She had taken a seat on one of the chairs, and was\r\nsitting with her hands clasping her knees. Floyd, who had taken his\r\nseat at the table, was leaning his arms upon it and following with his\r\neyes the graining of the wood.\r\n\r\nThe spider overhead, who had finished making, or maybe repairing, his\r\nnet, had just fallen on luck; a long-legged fly that had been flitting\r\nabout the rafters was his prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe fly, caught by a few strands of the infernal web, was making a\r\nfierce resistance. It was caught by one of its legs and by the body.\r\nThe wings were free, and the buzz of their vibration made Floyd look up.\r\n\r\nThen, for something to do, he rose and examined the thing more closely.\r\nIsbel rose, too.\r\n\r\nThe spider was quite patient about his work, and horribly scientific\r\nin his methods. The buzzing wings did not disturb him in the least. He\r\nascended to the rafter which was his base, and then came down again,\r\nfixed a thread to one of his victim's legs, and reascended. He was\r\nbinding the legs together, making everything absolutely secure before\r\nthe final assault and the moment when he would bury his fangs in his\r\nprey and suck its blood.\r\n\r\nWatching the little tragedy, Floyd and Isbel for a moment almost forgot\r\ntheir own position. Then Floyd, with a laugh, raised his finger and\r\nbroke the strands of the web, releasing the fly.\r\n\r\n\"It was in about as bad a position as we are,\" said he. \"Maybe it's an\r\nomen.\"\r\n\r\nIsbel did not know what the word \"omen\" meant, nor did she ask, for at\r\nthat moment, as they stood in silence watching the released one trying\r\nits wings again, a sound coming from the back of the house made them\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nA soft, stealthy sound, as though people were creeping close to the\r\nwall, and now and then the sharp snap of some stick of the undergrowth\r\ntrodden upon and broken.\r\n\r\nFloyd, springing to the table, seized a revolver and began firing\r\nthrough the loophole of the back wall. He fired six shots at random;\r\nthen he paused to listen.\r\n\r\nThe sound continued. The men outside were evidently crouching at\r\nwhatever work they were on, and so were safe and below the level of the\r\nloopholes.\r\n\r\n\"Brutes!\" said he. \"There is no chance of reaching them, but what on\r\nearth can they be about?\"\r\n\r\nIsbel, who had been peeping through one of the chinks near the door,\r\ncame toward him.\r\n\r\n\"The day has broken,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nDAYBREAK\r\n\r\n\r\nEven as she spoke the words, and as though in answer to the question\r\nhe had asked, a faint smell of burning filled the air of the room, and\r\nthrough one of the chinks, like a little gray snake, a wreath of smoke\r\ncoiled upward, clinging to the woodwork.\r\n\r\n\"So that's what they were doing!\" cried Floyd. \"They have fired the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nThrough every chink and crevice a curl of smoke was licking upward, and\r\nnow came the sharp, crackling sound of brushwood burning and the snap\r\nand hiss of sticks blazing alight.\r\n\r\nThe air of the room was already turned to a gray haze of smoke, smoke\r\nthat made the eyes smart, the smoke of burning hibiscus and poison oak\r\nand bay cedar bush, choking and suffocating fumes, followed now by\r\nflames as the wretches outside flung coconut shells on the fire, shells\r\nthat blazed like flare lamps once ignited.\r\n\r\n\"The place will burn like a torch,\" said Floyd, \"once the scantling\r\ngets alight. Listen! What's that above? They have got on the roof; they\r\nare lighting it. We must quit and make a dash for the dinghy. It's our\r\nonly chance. Wait!\"\r\n\r\nHe rushed into the smaller room, and returned with something in his\r\nhands. It was the tin box holding the pearls.\r\n\r\nHe opened it, emptied the contents wrapped in cotton wool, and filled\r\nhis pockets.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to leave these behind,\" said he, speaking as if\r\nto himself. Then to Isbel: \"Take a revolver and this package of\r\nammunition. I'll take the other and a rifle. Unbar the door and run\r\nfirst. Don't stop to fire unless you can't help. Hark! What's that?\"\r\n\r\nA sound like a sharp clap of thunder shook the air and was followed by\r\na yell from the grove behind the house and from the beach on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"Open the door!\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nIsbel undid the bars, and flung the door wide. Instantly the draft\r\nsettling from the grove filled the place with volumes of smoke.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Floyd, \"run!\"\r\n\r\nThey dashed out of the house, across the beach, running, half blind\r\nwith the effects of the smoke. They had expected a flight of spears.\r\nThey found instead an empty beach, full dawn, and a reef over which the\r\nlast of their assailants were scrambling.\r\n\r\nA great white cloud filled the break of the reef. It was the _Southern\r\nCross_ coming in with a fair wind and a flooding tide.\r\n\r\nThe first rays of the sun were on her topsails, which the wind scarcely\r\nfilled. The water under her was still violet with night. White gulls,\r\nrose-colored gulls, golden gulls, as the sunrise took them, were\r\nflocking and screaming in the pale sapphire above her, schooner, gulls,\r\nlagoon, and sky making a picture more lovely than a dream.\r\n\r\nAs she cleared the reef entrance and rounded to her anchorage, the wind\r\nspilling out of her sails, a plume of smoke broke from her, and again\r\nthe report of a gun shook the island.\r\n\r\nAs it died away the splash of the anchor was followed by a roar of the\r\nchain through the hawse pipe, and the _Southern Cross_, her long, long\r\njourney over, lay at her moorings swinging to the incoming tide.\r\n\r\nIsbel turned to Floyd and clung to him, weeping. All her courage had\r\nsuddenly vanished now that there was no need for it.\r\n\r\nFloyd, holding her tight in his arms, kissed her black, perfumed hair.\r\nThe flower had fallen, but a trace of its scent remained.\r\n\r\nIt was the moment of his life, and then she drew away from him, cast\r\none dark glance obliquely up at him, and stood with her breast heaving\r\nand both hands shading her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was looking over the water in the direction of the _Southern Cross_.\r\n\r\nThe schooner was lowering a boat. It was the whaleboat, and Floyd saw\r\nthe men tumbling into her, followed by a white-clad figure--Schumer.\r\n\r\nEven at that distance he recognized Schumer. Following Schumer came\r\nanother white-clad figure, evidently a European.\r\n\r\nBesides the two white men there were twelve hands in the boat, fourteen\r\nin all, and as she approached rapidly, urged by the long ash sweeps,\r\nFloyd saw the rifles with which the men were armed, the barrels showing\r\nas they rested, muzzle upward, by the seats.\r\n\r\nAs the boat came ashore Schumer, from his place in the stern sheets,\r\nwaved his hand to Floyd. Then the fellows, jumping out, beached the\r\nboat, and Schumer, following them, set foot on the sand.\r\n\r\nHe did not waste words.\r\n\r\nHe had seen the whole business at a glance, and he had brought canvas\r\nbuckets. Dense columns of smoke were rising from the back part of\r\nthe house, but the roof had fortunately not caught alight. The crew\r\nhad their orders, and in a moment they were filling the buckets and\r\ncarrying them up to the grove while Schumer, Floyd, and the newcomer\r\nhelped and superintended.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers had piled stacks of underwood, sticks, and all the\r\nrubbish they could find against the house wall. The stuff was burning\r\nwith more smoke than flame, and the fire had fortunately taken no\r\nconsiderable hold on the building. They kicked the rubbish aside, flung\r\nwater on the wall, and in twenty minutes or so the situation was saved.\r\n\r\nIsbel had been posted by Schumer as a lookout in case the enemy should\r\nreturn. She had not contented herself by standing by as a watch, but\r\nhad gone as far as the grove end, from where the reef could be seen up\r\nto the pierhead. She had seen nothing. The whole crowd of the enemy, in\r\nfact, had scattered back to the fishing camp by the road they had come\r\nthe night before, and Schumer, standing now on the beach, could see\r\nthem through his glass congregated about the tents.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Floyd. \"Well,\" said he, \"you seem to have had a\r\nlively time. What was the bother?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd explained in a few words, and, Isbel not being by, told of the\r\ntrouble with Sru.\r\n\r\n\"He was plotting mischief all the time,\" said Floyd, \"and this is the\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, \"we will deal with the gentleman all in good\r\ntime. What luck have you had with the pearls?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd told.\r\n\r\nTaking off his coat, and laying it on the sands, he began to remove the\r\npearls, in their casings of cotton wool, from the pockets. He explained\r\nwhy he had placed them there, and, as he went on with the work, Schumer\r\nand the stranger, standing by, looked on.\r\n\r\nSchumer up to this had been too busy to introduce the newcomer. He did\r\nso now.\r\n\r\n\"This is Captain Hakluyt,\" said he. \"He's in this venture, as I will\r\nexplain to you afterward. His firm owns the _Southern Cross_.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd looked up, and nodded to Hakluyt.\r\n\r\nThe new man's face was not a certificate of character. There are faces\r\nthat repel at first sight, and Hakluyt's was one of them.\r\n\r\nHe had the appearance, not so much of a man who was ill, but of a man\r\nwho never enjoyed good health. Anæmic looking despite his exposure to\r\nsun and wind, he seemed unable to bear either the full light of the\r\nsun or a full gaze. He was continually blinking, and to Floyd in that\r\nmoment he suggested vividly the idea of a sick owl.\r\n\r\nIt was the curve of the nose and the blinking of the eyelids that\r\nproduced this impression. The eyes themselves were not at all owllike,\r\nbeing small and set close together.\r\n\r\nThe whole figure of the man matched his face, slight and mean, with\r\nshoulders sloping like the shoulders of a champagne bottle. It was a\r\nfigure that no tailor could improve.\r\n\r\nHis hands, as he stood with the thumbs in the armholes of his\r\nwaistcoat, showed lean and clawlike, birdlike. Birdlike is the term\r\nbest suited for the whole man; light, restless, peering, and without\r\ngrace, for it is a fact that the animal and the bird translated into\r\nhuman terms lose both grace and nobility. Man standing or falling by\r\nhis approach or recession to the type, man.\r\n\r\nAs Floyd looked up from his work he took in Hakluyt's appearance fully\r\nfor the first time, and the idea that this man was the new partner in\r\ntheir concern filled him with repulsion and uneasiness.\r\n\r\nHe had been on the point of exposing the pearls triumphantly to view,\r\nbut in a flash he altered his decision, and, asking them to wait for a\r\nmoment, left his work and ran up to the house for the tin cash box from\r\nwhich he had taken them.\r\n\r\nHe placed it on the sand, and packing in the precious\r\ncotton-wool-covered parcels, closed the lid and handed it to Schumer.\r\n\r\n\"We can examine them afterward,\" said he. \"Keep them for the present.\r\nThey are not a bad lot, but they might be better.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll put them in the house,\" replied Schumer. \"I've got a safe\r\non board; brought it from Sydney, but I can't get it ashore till\r\nto-morrow. Meanwhile they'll be all right in the house. Well, Hakluyt,\r\nwhat do you think of the island?\"\r\n\r\nHakluyt looked about him as though taking stock of the place for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n\"It is not so bad,\" said he. \"It is a fair bit of a lagoon, but it\r\nmight be bigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it will be big enough for us,\" replied Schumer, with a laugh.\r\n\"Come up to the house with me, Floyd, till I put this stuff away. I\r\nwant to have a talk with you.\"\r\n\r\nThey left Hakluyt, and walked up to the house.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Floyd, \"if that's our new man I don't like the look of\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer laughed.\r\n\r\n\"He's not a beauty,\" said he, \"but he's the best I could find. He's\r\nHakluyt & Son. He's the son; the father's dead. He's in a good way of\r\nbusiness as a shipowner and ship's chandler in Sydney. He has got the\r\nmoney and the means to help us. I have drawn up a contract with him; he\r\ngets a third share.\"\r\n\r\n\"A third share. That means that the total profits will be divided into\r\nthree parts. One for you, one for me, and one for Hakluyt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Schumer, \"and you pay me for the trade goods we salved\r\nfrom the _Tonga_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Floyd, \"but it seems to me that Hakluyt ought to\r\nstand in with me and pay something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggested that, but he refused. He would only come into the deal on\r\ncondition that he got a third share of the profits without deduction.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd felt inclined to grumble at this. Hakluyt would have the benefit\r\nof those goods or what was left of them, but he said nothing. He wanted\r\nexplanation on another point.\r\n\r\n\"How about the _Southern Cross_?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we salved her, didn't we, or as good as salved her? Hakluyt\r\nought to pay for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was this way,\" replied Schumer. \"Before coming into the venture he\r\nwanted half profits. He gave me to understand that our connection with\r\nthe _Southern Cross_ was in no way a salving job, since the crew were\r\non board, and he said straight out that he would fight the matter in\r\nthe courts. Now, as he has lots of money to fight with, and we have\r\nnone, or next to none, I didn't see any sense in that. He said to me:\r\n'I'll tell you what I'll do. In recognition of your trouble in bringing\r\nthe schooner back to Sydney, I'll be content to take only a third of\r\nthe profits in this pearling business. What's more, I will use the\r\nschooner for it free of charge and victual and man her.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, that seemed to me a fair proposition, and I agreed to it. What do\r\nyou say?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd did not reply for a moment. He could come to no decision. The\r\nwhole thing was so intricate and the values involved were such unknown\r\nqualities that at last he gave it up. If Schumer was satisfied it was\r\ndoubtless all right. Schumer knew more of business affairs than he did,\r\nand it was better to leave it at that.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I suppose you couldn't do better, but it seems to\r\nme Hakluyt won't do badly out of the business. Wait till I show you\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached the house, and, taking the cash box from Schumer,\r\nFloyd placed it on the table and opened it.\r\n\r\nHe carefully removed some of the contents till he came to the package\r\nhe was looking for; then, carefully removing the cotton wool from it,\r\nhe exposed the pink pearl.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, man!\" said Schumer. \"Why didn't you tell me of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nHe took another small ball of wool from the box, unrolled the wool, and\r\nheld out the big white pearl.\r\n\r\nSchumer laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Any more?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not of that size,\" replied Floyd. \"Well, what do you think of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Think of them? They are a fortune in themselves.\"\r\n\r\nHe carefully rolled them up again and replaced them in the box.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Floyd had been unpacking other specimens, which Schumer\r\nexamined in their turn. He seemed well pleased with the take since his\r\nabsence, as well he might be.\r\n\r\n\"I will have the safe brought ashore to-morrow,\" said he. \"Meanwhile\r\nthey will be all right here. Put them all back and come on. We have to\r\ntackle these scamps now and bring them to their senses. I don't want\r\nany fighting, if possible, for that would mean killing more of them,\r\nand we want them all for the fishery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say you are going to trust them to work again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am. Why, man, it is nothing when one is working fellows\r\nlike these to have revolts and rows. You shouldn't have let them get\r\nso much out of hand. I don't blame you, mind, for you are new to the\r\nbusiness, but in the first instance you should have dealt properly\r\nwith Sru. You should have shot him after that business about the girl.\r\nMartial law is the only law by which you can hold your own in a case\r\nlike this. Well, we will see. Take your gun and come along.\"\r\n\r\nThey went out, and Schumer ordered the whaleboat to be manned.\r\n\r\nFloyd for the first time recognized that the crew of the whaleboat were\r\nthe same Kanakas who had formed the original crew of the _Southern\r\nCross_. Mountain Joe was one of them. He saluted Floyd when he was\r\nrecognized, and then took his place as stroke oar. Each man had a rifle\r\nand seemed to know how to use it, and they had all the stamp of men\r\nreliant and trained to arms.\r\n\r\nThey were not the same men--viewed as fighting men--that Schumer had\r\ntaken away with him. He had done wonders with them in his absence, and\r\nthe thought suddenly occurred to Floyd: Did Schumer expect that there\r\nwould be trouble on the island during his absence? Did he train and arm\r\nthe crew of the _Southern Cross_ in view of this possible trouble?\r\n\r\nIt seemed so.\r\n\r\nThen came another thought: Suppose you had been defeated and killed,\r\nwould not Schumer have benefited? There would have been one partner the\r\nless, and ought he not to have warned you more especially as to the\r\ndanger of a revolt?\r\n\r\nSchumer had, in fact, warned him casually to be on the lookout, but\r\nhis warning had chiefly to do with the cache and the necessity of\r\npreventing its locality and contents from becoming known. He had not\r\ndwelt on the matter of a possible revolt, nor had he prepared plans to\r\nmeet it.\r\n\r\nDid he hope to return and find a clear field and his partner put out of\r\nthe way?\r\n\r\nFloyd instantly dismissed the idea as unworthy of himself and Schumer.\r\nHe had no tittle of real evidence to support such an idea--yet it had\r\noccurred to him.\r\n\r\nThere are some ideas that arise not from any concrete basis, but from\r\nvague suggestions. This was one of them.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the fishing beach they could see the enemy\r\nscuttering about in alarm. Fellows came out of the tents, shaded their\r\neyes for a second, and then darted off into the grove. In less than a\r\nminute not a soul was in sight.\r\n\r\n\"There'll be no fighting,\" said Schumer as the boat came to the beach,\r\nand they sprang out. \"Floyd, you stay here with the men and I'll take\r\nMountain Joe up to the wood edge and have a palaver. I'll leave my gun\r\nwith you so they may see we've come for peace, not war. They are sure\r\nto be peeping and spying from the trees.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the rifle, and, taking Joe with him, walked steadily up from\r\nthe lagoon edge to the grove. Twenty paces from the trees he stopped\r\nand began to speak.\r\n\r\nFloyd could hear his voice, and it was strange enough to see him\r\nstanding there and seemingly addressing the trees.\r\n\r\nMountain Joe also put in a word now and then as if on his own account.\r\n\r\nThe effect was absolutely negative, and Floyd expected to see them turn\r\nand come back.\r\n\r\nBut Schumer knew the native mind and its ways, and he did not seem the\r\nleast disconcerted at his failure. He paused in his oration, walked up\r\nand down a bit, and then began to talk again.\r\n\r\nPresently, not from the trees before him, but from the trees at the\r\nleft-hand side of the grove, a native appeared. He stood for a moment,\r\nnow resting on one foot, now on the other. Then he said a few words, to\r\nwhich Schumer replied.\r\n\r\nThey kept this up for a minute or so, and then, from the wood, another\r\nnative joined the first, then another and another.\r\n\r\n\"They are all right now,\" cried Schumer to Floyd. \"Come up and help to\r\njaw them. Leave your gun behind.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd handed his rifle to one of the men and came right up to the group\r\nof natives before whom Schumer was now standing. He was talking to\r\nthem, to use his own expression, like a Dutch uncle. Talking as only he\r\nknew how.\r\n\r\nThe Polynesian native, pick him up in most places, has a good deal of\r\nhumor in his composition. He can both feel and use sarcasm. He has over\r\nand above this a certain bonhomie, a good spirit readily worked if one\r\nknows how.\r\n\r\nSchumer knew how. He did not speak them fair by any means. He told them\r\nwhat was in his mind about them, told them they were pigs who would\r\nhave dashed to their own destruction but for his arrival, yet told them\r\nit in a way that did not stir resentment.\r\n\r\nThese half-civilized creatures had been cast right back into savagery\r\nby some influence beyond their control. Sru had not been the influence,\r\nbut he had worked it, just as a sorcerer might raise a devil.\r\n\r\nSru had not yet made his appearance. Schumer asked for him, and the\r\nreply came that he was dead and lying over somewhere in the grove near\r\nthe house. One of the stray shots fired by Floyd while the brushwood\r\nwas being placed against the house wall had found Sru and sent him to\r\nhis last account.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Schumer, \"that's the best news we have had yet. It clears\r\nup everything. You don't want to punish these fellows, do you? Seems to\r\nme you have given them a pretty good grueling already, three dead and\r\nseveral wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to punish them,\" said Floyd. \"You can tell them I call it\r\nquits. Sru was the man most to blame, and now he is dead. But there is\r\none man I have a grudge against--Timau--and I don't see him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Timau,\" said Schumer. \"Which one is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a fellow whose life I saved at a great deal of risk and trouble.\r\nHe stepped into one of those big clamshells and got seized, and I\r\nmanaged to free him, but he's not here.\"\r\n\r\nSchumer turned to the natives and asked them where Timau was; then he\r\ntranslated to Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"It seems he wouldn't take part in the business because you had brought\r\nhim back from the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did, with artificial respiration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so--and Sru bound him and put him in one of the tents. He's there\r\nnow. We had better go and loose him.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked up to the tents, and there sure enough they found Timau\r\nlying on his side and chewing tobacco. He had managed to get one arm\r\nfree and could have freed himself entirely had he taken the trouble.\r\nHe had not. He just lay there, chewing and waiting on events. He was\r\nthe laziest of the whole crowd employed on the fishery, and since his\r\nreturn from death he seemed to take everything as a fatalist.\r\n\r\nBut he had refused to join in the attack on Floyd.\r\n\r\nSchumer undid his bonds, and he stood up, stretched himself, grunted,\r\nand walked off to join the others.\r\n\r\nSchumer looked after him.\r\n\r\n\"He's a cool customer. Well, there's an end of the business. To-morrow\r\nthey will all be working again, except the dead men. Now let's get\r\nback and bury Sru. We'll have to hunt for him in the grove. Then you\r\ncan come on board and we will have something to eat. You haven't had\r\nbreakfast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, no!\" replied Floyd. \"I had a sort of supper some time in the\r\nnight, but what I want most is sleep. I'll lie down and have a snooze\r\nwhen we have finished up with Sru.\"\r\n\r\nThey came back to the house, and then started out to find what the\r\ngrove had to reveal to them.\r\n\r\nThe cache had been half rifled, but most of the goods that had been\r\ntaken were still lying on the sands and had not been injured.\r\n\r\nThen they found Sru lying at the foot of an artus tree, a broken spear\r\nin his hand. He was lying on his face, and he would not trouble them\r\nany more.\r\n\r\nSchumer buried him after a fashion of his own. He ordered two of the\r\ncrew to carry the deceased to the pierhead at the break in the reef and\r\ncast him to the sharks.\r\n\r\n\"They'll look after him,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nHAKLUYT\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day work resumed as usual, Hakluyt assisting, or, at least,\r\nstanding by to watch the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers had destroyed nothing. All the shell that had been taken\r\nsince the beginning of the work was intact, and the oysters that lay\r\nawaiting search when the revolt broke out were still there, lying\r\nwhere they had been left. As though fate wished to stimulate Hakluyt's\r\ninterest in the business on this the first day of resumption of work\r\nthe take proved to be exceptionally good. Three large pearls of good\r\nsize and form came to hand besides several of less value.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't reckon every day's take by this,\" said Schumer. \"Often\r\nthere's nothing much. In this business it's the take of a week or month\r\nthat counts.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same it is good,\" said Hakluyt. He spoke as though there\r\nwere some obstruction in his nasal organ, and Floyd, listening to him\r\nand watching him, felt more than ever the aversion for him that had\r\ninfluenced him so powerfully on their first meeting.\r\n\r\nHakluyt watched all the proceedings just as a predatory bird\r\nwatches its prey. He stood with his thumbs in the armholes of his\r\nwaistcoat--his favorite attitude--a cigar in his mouth, and his panama\r\nhat tilted back.\r\n\r\nHe had a habit of thrusting his head forward, tortoise-like--one\r\nmight have fancied that his neck was telescopic like the neck of a\r\ntortoise--and continually he kept drumming on his chest with his finger\r\ntips. On the middle finger of his left hand he wore a huge ring set\r\nwith a diamond, an adornment that did not match with the shabby suit\r\nof white drill that flapped about him in the wind, showing to full\r\ndisadvantage the thinness of his legs and arms and the protuberance of\r\nhis stomach.\r\n\r\n\"That chap,\" thought Floyd to himself, \"would do anything short of\r\nmurder--and maybe wouldn't stop at that.\"\r\n\r\nIsbel also did not seem to have much liking for Hakluyt.\r\n\r\nWith the return of Schumer, Isbel had gone right back to her previous\r\nposition in the social scale of the island and also to her home in the\r\ngrove. She helped in the cooking as before, and she kept watch for\r\nships when Floyd and his companions were over at the fishing grounds,\r\nbut beyond that she had little to do with them.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of the landing of Schumer she had avoided Floyd. It was\r\nas though a veil had suddenly fallen between them after that moment\r\nwhen suddenly released from death she had clung to him as they stood\r\nwatching the _Southern Cross_ casting anchor. She had drawn away, and\r\nnow it was as though nothing had ever been between them at all, as\r\nthough they had never fought together and lived together and faced\r\ndeath together.\r\n\r\nFloyd, simple soul, could not understand her in the least. At first he\r\nwas perplexed, thought he had done something to offend her, and tried\r\nto imagine what it could be. Then he sulked--turned his head away when\r\nshe drew near and avoided speaking to her.\r\n\r\nOne day, a week after the return of Schumer, he was on the windward\r\nside of the reef behind the grove and the house. Schumer and Hakluyt\r\nwere over at the fishing camp. It was an hour before noon, and he had\r\nfinished the work he had been upon and was seated on a lump of coral\r\nwatching the breakers coming in, a wonderful vision of sunlit foam.\r\n\r\nThe breeze brought the spray almost to his feet, and a scent of ozone\r\nand seaweed and salt that seemed to come from the very heart of the sea.\r\n\r\nAs he sat like this a shadow fell on the coral before him, and,\r\nturning, he saw Isbel.\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him.\r\n\r\nHe had been thinking of her, and nothing could have surprised him more\r\nthan this action of hers in coming and sitting beside him. He moved\r\nslightly as though to make room for her, and then turned his face\r\nseaward again.\r\n\r\nA frigate bird was approaching the island, moving without an effort on\r\nthe wind. They watched it as it came along. Its shadow passed over them\r\nand vanished, and Floyd, turning his head to take a last look at the\r\nbird, found himself face to face with his companion.\r\n\r\nIsbel had not spoken a word, but now, as their eyes met, her lips\r\nmoved as though she were whispering something to herself impossible\r\nto say aloud. She seemed like a person in a trance, and her eyes,\r\nwide-pupiled and fixed on those of her companion, seemed trying to\r\ntell something impossible to tell by speech.\r\n\r\nNext moment he had taken her in his arms. For a moment she resisted\r\nslightly, as though that soul, strange and free as the soul of the sea\r\nbird, were struggling feebly against the final capture of man.\r\n\r\nThen she raised her lips to his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nORDERED TO SYDNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Schumer took Floyd aside.\r\n\r\n\"Hakluyt is well pleased with the work here,\" said he. \"He thinks the\r\nprospects even better than I made them out to him, and now he wants to\r\ngo back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he?\" said Floyd. The news came as a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has got his business in Sydney to attend to and he's keen on\r\ngetting back at once. Of course he goes in the _Southern Cross_, but he\r\ncan't go alone, for the schooner has to be brought back.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must go with him,\" said Schumer. \"There is no one else for the\r\njob.\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" exclaimed Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is no one else. I have been away too long. In fact I only\r\ngot back in time to save the situation. You are a very good fellow,\r\nFloyd, but you aren't much use for working natives. It's not your\r\nbusiness in life; it is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But see here,\" said the other, \"why can't Hakluyt send the schooner\r\nback with another man in charge? There are lots of men in Sydney who\r\ncould do the job.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and what would that mean? Letting another man into our secrets.\r\nSurely you are not against doing your share of the work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" cried Floyd, flushing. \"Have I ever refused to do all in my power\r\nto help? Of course I will go. Only, the thing has come on me as a\r\nsurprise, and, I will say it frankly, an unpleasant surprise. You say\r\nHakluyt wants to go back at once. Well, I think you might have told me\r\nof it some days ago. You must have known all along.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not,\" said Schumer. \"Of course I knew he wanted to go, but I\r\ndid not know he wanted to go so soon. What does it matter? You have no\r\npreparations to make.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the navigating on the way back?\" asked Floyd, ignoring the\r\nlast remark. \"You had Hakluyt to help you coming, but if I am to come\r\nback single-handed it seems to me I will be in a bad way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have Mountain Joe,\" replied Schumer. \"I have given special\r\nattention to that gentleman's education on the voyage to Sydney and\r\nback. You remember he could work out a dead reckoning even when I took\r\nhim in hand. He was absolutely useless by himself, but under guidance\r\nhe could be quite useful. Well, he knows a lot more now, and if I could\r\nget to Sydney with him as he was then, you can surely get back from\r\nSydney with him as he is now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I suppose that will be all right,\" said Floyd. \"And what am I to\r\ndo in Sydney besides dumping Hakluyt there?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will unlade the shell which I am sending and take in some more\r\nprovisions. The _Southern Cross_ wants an overhaul--that will take a\r\nweek or ten days--she wants some new spars and a few barnacles scraped\r\noff her. We want a big lot of canned stuff, vegetables, and bully beef.\r\nI'll talk to you to-night about that. Hakluyt is in the way of getting\r\nit cheaper than we could if we were working alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long do you think we will have to stay in Sydney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, about three weeks or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be over two months before I can get back.\"\r\n\r\n\"About that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when exactly do you want me to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, in a couple of days. It will take us that to get the shell aboard.\r\nI am going to start on the work this morning. I'll get all the hands on\r\nit, crew and fishermen both. We can get the stuff on board on the raft\r\nand with the help of the whaleboat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Floyd, \"I'll go.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned away and walked along the lagoon edge. Always when Fortune\r\nturned toward him she had something unpleasant to add to her gifts.\r\nThe pink pearl had been followed by the running away of Isbel, and the\r\ngreat white pearl by the mutiny of the hands. Isbel had been given to\r\nhim only yesterday, and now he had to leave her.\r\n\r\nSince yesterday he had lived in a state of extraordinary happiness.\r\nWonderland. To love and to find that you are loved. There is nothing\r\nelse. No dream can come near this reality. And now he had to leave her.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the reef, and stood looking out to sea. The Pacific lay\r\nblazing beneath the morning light, blue beyond the sun dazzle and\r\nheaving shoreward to burst in foam at his feet. The breeze came fresh\r\nacross it, vivid and full of life. Floyd loved the sea.\r\n\r\nIt had become part of his nature and part of his being. It was his\r\nsecond mother. But to-day he was looking at it with fresh eyes. It was\r\nno longer the sea; it was separation from all he cared for and all he\r\nloved. He would have to leave Isbel and leave her with Schumer.\r\n\r\nWhen he had landed on the island first, Schumer had impressed him\r\nfavorably, but little by little and by that slow process through which\r\na complex and illusive personality makes its quality known to a simple\r\nand straightforward mind, he had come to the point of distrust as\r\nregards Schumer.\r\n\r\nHe had no fear at all that Schumer would harm Isbel. Isbel was a person\r\nwho could well take care of herself, and Schumer, he distinctly felt,\r\nwas not a man dangerous to women. The instinctive feeling of danger\r\nhad to do with himself. He was a fifth wheel in Schumer's chariot, an\r\nabsorber of profits, and though he refused the thought that Schumer\r\nmight attempt to get rid of him, he could not refuse the instinct.\r\n\r\nHe felt suddenly surrounded by an atmosphere of danger none the less\r\ndisturbing from the fact that he could not tell from what point it\r\narose. He disliked this journey to Sydney, and he disliked Hakluyt even\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBrave as any man could be, he feared for his own safety, not for his\r\nown sake, but for the sake of Isbel. Should anything happen to him what\r\nwould become of her?\r\n\r\nAnd there was nothing he could do. He was completely in the grasp of\r\nevents. He could not refuse to perform this obvious duty that had\r\nsuddenly been laid down before him by Schumer. He could not take Isbel\r\nwith him, and he could not take any precautions as to his own safety\r\nbeyond simple watchfulness.\r\n\r\nHe turned back from the sea, and as he turned he saw Isbel. She was\r\nstanding at the edge of the grove, and the trees quite sheltered them\r\nfrom the sight of the people by the house. He came toward her, and they\r\nentered the grove together.\r\n\r\nClose to the sea edge of the grove a huge tree had fallen. Rotten with\r\nage, it had crashed its way through the lesser trees and lay like a\r\ndead giant over which the undergrowth had cast its green skirts in\r\npart. They sat down upon it, and Isbel, nestling up close beside him,\r\nrested her head upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThen he told her that he was going. Told her the whole thing and the\r\nreasons that held him. Told her that the separation would only be for a\r\nlittle while, and surely, surely he would come back, and as he talked\r\nand explained he felt her shudder as a person shudders from the cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nGOOD-BY\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that morning and all that day Schumer kept the hands busy at\r\nwork bringing the shell across the lagoon and storing it aboard the\r\n_Southern Cross_. Some of it was rafted over and some brought in the\r\nwhaleboat. Schumer superintended everything himself, and now that speed\r\nwas urgent he proved what he could do as a driver.\r\n\r\nNever did a Yankee stevedore work a set of hands harder. His voice\r\nacted as a whiplash, and his energy infected everybody.\r\n\r\nNext day it was the same, so that at sundown the last of the shell was\r\non board, the locking bars secured, and nothing remained but to take on\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\"We can do that to-night,\" said Schumer, \"and if this wind holds,\r\nthough there is not much of it, you will be able to start at sunup. It\r\nwill be slack tide about then. Now, if you will come up to the house, I\r\nwill give you the last details of what you have to do in Sydney. There\r\nis nothing like having everything cut and dried.\"\r\n\r\nThey went up to the house, and Schumer at once plunged into accounts.\r\nHe had tabulated a list of all the stores required, and he had written\r\ndown the main points in Floyd's program, even to the address of a house\r\nwhere he could stay.\r\n\r\nHakluyt looked on while the two men talked, and, when they had\r\nfinished, the three went out, Hakluyt and Schumer to see to the\r\nwatering of the vessel and Floyd to find Isbel.\r\n\r\nIt was a night of the full moon, a hot, almost windless, night filled\r\nwith the scent of flowers and the song of the reef.\r\n\r\nThe moon hung almost in the zenith, the apex of a pyramid of light, and\r\nunder the silent whiteness of the moon the island lay clipping the vast\r\npond of the lagoon in its arms as a mistress holds her lover.\r\n\r\nHakluyt and Schumer had taken the boat to fetch the water casks, and\r\nfrom away out over the water came the sound of the oars. The fellows\r\nover at the fishing camp were singing, untired by their day's work,\r\nand now and then on a stronger puff of wind a snatch of their song\r\ncame over the lagoon water, and, just for a moment, as Floyd stood by\r\nthe water edge, all his trouble of mind lifted from him--for a moment.\r\nThe brilliant light, the beauty of the scene before him, the snatch of\r\nsong from the fishing camp, and the perfume of the flower-scented wind\r\nseemed to open doors in his mind through which from some remote past\r\ncame happiness. The moonlight for a moment caught some magic from the\r\nmorning of the world. Then he turned and went toward the outer reef\r\nedge, where Isbel was waiting for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour before dawn the beach before the house was astir. The moon had\r\nsunk, but the stars gave enough light to work by. The water was all\r\naboard, and now some coconuts, breadfruit, and taro roots were being\r\ntaken off. Floyd was directing operations. He had said good-by to\r\nIsbel, who was nowhere to be seen. He sat in the stern sheets of the\r\nfruit boat, steering, and when the stuff was transshipped he boarded\r\nthe _Southern Cross_ and sent the empty boat back for Schumer and\r\nHakluyt.\r\n\r\nSchumer came on board, and stood chatting while the hands were at the\r\ncapstan bars getting the slack of the anchor chain in. Then when the\r\nmainsail was being set and the hands were at the halyards, Schumer\r\nslipped over the side into the boat and pushed off for shore.\r\n\r\nAs the anchor came up, Floyd, who was forward superintending the men,\r\nleft Joe to see to the securing of it and came aft to where Hakluyt was\r\nstanding by the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was now bright in a sky that showed scarcely a trace of\r\nmorning bank. It came over the reef and between the palms, whose trunks\r\nstood like bars against the brightening east. It flooded the lagoon\r\nas the schooner gathered way, and the great trapezium of the mainsail\r\nshowed a tip of rose gold as they passed the pierheads of the reef. On\r\nthe pierhead to port something showed white against the coral. It was\r\nIsbel.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ rose to the swell at the break of the reef just\r\nas a horse rises to a low fence, the foam roared in her wake, and the\r\nnoise of it mixed with the clatter of the rudder chain as the fellow at\r\nthe wheel twirled the spokes. Floyd raised his hand, and Isbel signaled\r\nin reply as the wind, now gaining its morning strength, pressed the\r\nschooner over to the tune of straining cordage and creaking blocks.\r\n\r\nFloyd, leaning on the after rail, looked backward. The little figure of\r\nIsbel was no longer to be seen, blotted out by distance. Then distance\r\ntook the reef, leaving only a trace of palm tops above the blazing\r\nwater, and in an hour the Island of Pearls had vanished like a dream\r\nbeyond the edge of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nSYDNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nHakluyt, despite his appearance, was a very efficient schooner captain,\r\nand as day followed day, Floyd's respect for him as a sailor rose more\r\nand more. As a man, he disliked him just as much as ever.\r\n\r\nIt was not an active dislike. His temper never rose against him, for\r\nHakluyt, to give him his due, was perfectly easy to get on with. He\r\nneither swore at the hands nor heckled the subordinate officer. On\r\nthe contrary, he seemed always endeavoring to make himself agreeable,\r\nalways anxious for smooth water. The dislike that Floyd had for him\r\nwas instinctive and beyond the reach of reason, but he did not show it\r\noutwardly as he would have done had Hakluyt been difficult to get on\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ was a good deal of a Dutch ship. Hakluyt hailed\r\noriginally from Amsterdam, and he brought the Dutch flavor with him.\r\nHe was an eternal cigar smoker, and the food and drink on board were\r\nreminiscent of Holland, especially the De Kuyper. There was a certain\r\nslackness also, and a go-as-you-please method of doing this foreign to\r\nan English ship.\r\n\r\nYet she made good way without taking any risk. The great art of\r\nschooner sailing as laid down by Hakluyt was formulated by him as\r\nfollows: \"Carry all the canvas that you can without danger to your\r\nsticks.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this art implied not only good handling of your vessel, but\r\nincessant weather watchfulness, at all events in the Pacific, where\r\nsqualls drop on you out of a perfectly fair sky.\r\n\r\nThree weeks brought them to Sydney, and though it was not Floyd's first\r\nacquaintance with the harbor which seems to have been made when the\r\ngods were making harbors for great fleets that have vanished, it still\r\nfilled him with the same wonder and admiration and surprise.\r\n\r\nThey anchored close to McGinnis' wharf, and Floyd on the morning of his\r\narrival found himself a comparatively free man for a few days.\r\n\r\n\"Run round the town and amuse yourself,\" said Hakluyt. \"Id is worth\r\nseeing. Id is good to stretch one's legs after a voyage, but first come\r\nto my place and I will show you over.\"\r\n\r\nHakluyt had two places, one on the wharves and the other an office on\r\nMarket Street.\r\n\r\nThe office was a dingy-looking place with wire blinds to the windows\r\ninscribed with the legend \"Hakluyt & Son\" done in dingy gold.\r\n\r\nThe place on the wharf was much more lively and pleasing to the mind.\r\n\r\nIt was an enormous emporium where everything was sold that could\r\nbe wanted by a shipmaster. Here you could buy an oilskin coat or\r\nthe provisions for a voyage round the world. It was all the same to\r\nHakluyt. He could put you in the way of a spare anchor or a barrel of\r\npetroleum or a slush tub with the same hand that dealt out tobacco and\r\npreserved fruit. His storehouses were enormous; he victualed his own\r\nships, and his influence in the maritime world was ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nA man who can give you a job if you are out of work or if your board of\r\ntrade certificates are not quite clear is a power. A man who can lend\r\nyou money and who is willing to do it if you are on your beam ends is\r\nalso a power.\r\n\r\nHakluyt had helped many a man. He had established that reputation, yet\r\nthe men he helped had better have gone without his help, for once he\r\ntouched a man in this way he held him. The money he lent always, nearly\r\nalways, returned to him with heavy interest. Sometimes he made a dead\r\nloss. He did not mind that, for he was a man who reckoned up things in\r\nthe large, and in the large he always profited, with this addition--he\r\ncould always put his hand on a man ready and able to do a dangerous or\r\ndirty job for him.\r\n\r\nFloyd, when Hakluyt had shown him over the wharfside store, took his\r\ngear to the house recommended by Schumer, where he obtained rooms. Then\r\nhe went out to see the town, and finished up by dining at a restaurant\r\nand going to the theater.\r\n\r\nNext morning he went down to superintend the towing of the _Southern\r\nCross_ into dry dock for an overhaul. This business held him for most\r\nof the day, and most of the next day he spent at the dock having a\r\ngood look at the vessel's copper sheathing. It seemed to him that the\r\ndry docking was a work of supererogation. The _Southern Cross_ was in\r\nexcellent condition, and Hakluyt was not the man to waste money in\r\nfrills. Why had he gone to this expense?\r\n\r\nThere were several of Hakluyt's ships in the harbor, and chumming up\r\nwith one of the wharfside loafers, he managed to obtain a good deal of\r\ninformation as to Hakluyt and his ships.\r\n\r\nSaid the broken-down sailorman, who was one reek of rum and navy twist:\r\n\r\n\"_Southern Cross_ in dry dock havin' her bottom scraped? I dunno in\r\nthe nation what bee's got into Hakluyt's bonnet. There's the _Mary and\r\nLouise_--that's her lyin' by the oil tank--the weeds fathoms long on\r\nher keel and the barnacles as big as saucers on her copper, yet she's\r\ngood enough to put out o' port without no dry dockin'. There's the\r\n_Boomerang_, another of his tubs. You can see her forrard, the yaller\r\none, beyond that point. She's wrong from stem to rudder, she's held\r\ntogether mostly by her paint, she hasn't seen a dry dock for years,\r\nan' the sight of one would make her spew her bolts. I reckon she's\r\njust held together by the salt water she floats in, yet he docks the\r\n_Southern Cross_! Is that all his vessels? No, it ain't. D'you see that\r\nschooner out there by the whistlin' buoy? She's the _Domain_. She's\r\nHakluyt's. Just come back from the islands a month ago. Been lyin'\r\nthere waitin' for I don't know what ever since. The copra's been out of\r\nher this fortnight, and there she lays waitin' her job.\r\n\r\n\"What sort o' man is Hakluyt? Well, he's no sort to speak of. He blew\r\nin here twenty years ago out of a Dutch ship that was glad to get rid\r\nof him, and here he's stuck and prospered till he's fair rotten with\r\nmoney and has his thumb on the town and half the harbor side as well.\r\nHe's owner and ship's chandler both. I've heard folk say he's sold his\r\nsoul to the devil, but that's a lie, for he ain't got a soul to sell.\r\nThe grub aboard his ships is most salt horse, and the bread bags has\r\nto be tethered they're that lively with the weevils. Go and ask any\r\nsailorman on the front if you don't believe me.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd did not need to confirm this view of Hakluyt by making inquiries\r\nof sailormen on the front. He took a long look at the _Domain_, and\r\nthen turned away from the wharfside and walked uptown to Hakluyt's\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nHakluyt was in, and they went over the list of stores together.\r\n\r\n\"You leave id all with me,\" said Hakluyt. \"I shall have them all aboard\r\nby the date of sailing. Well, and how do you like Sydney?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd expressed his opinion of Sydney. The dullest place in the world\r\nfor a lone man unaddicted to bar-room festivity or horse-racing.\r\nHakluyt gave him a pass for the theater, regretted that he could\r\nnot ask him to dinner, as he was a lone bachelor, told him to enjoy\r\nhimself, and dismissed him.\r\n\r\nDuring the next fortnight Floyd managed to amuse himself innocently\r\nenough. He had never been much of a reading man, but, picking up a\r\ncheap edition of the \"Count of Monte Cristo,\" he suddenly found a new\r\nworld open before him. He read it in bed at night, and he took it out\r\nwith him and read it by the sea front.\r\n\r\nIt occupied a good deal of his time, as he was a slow reader, and it\r\ngave him a new horizon and new ideas and a new energy.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo's discovery of the treasure, his escape from the Château\r\nd'If, the girl he loved, his cruel separation from her, his revenge,\r\nall these things appealed to his mind with the power of reality, as\r\nthey have appealed to minds all the world over and as they ever will\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished \"Monte Cristo,\" he bought a new novel. It was\r\nabout a young lady, who, starting life as a shop assistant, married a\r\nduke at the end of the third chapter. The book did not hold him, and he\r\nfell back on fishing.\r\n\r\nThere is good fishing to be had in the neighborhood of Sydney, and one\r\nday toward the end of the third week and close now to the time of the\r\nsailing of the _Southern Cross_, he met an individual on one of these\r\nfishing excursions, a joyous and friendly personage who, returning with\r\nhim to Sydney, proposed drinks and led the way into a bar.\r\n\r\nFloyd was not a drinking man, but the best of men make mistakes, and\r\nthe hot air of the bar, the friendliness of his new companion, the\r\npleasure of having some one to talk to, and the strength of the whisky\r\nhad their effect. He had not eaten since breakfast.\r\n\r\nPresently he found himself one of a mixed company. His first\r\nacquaintance had departed, yet he did not trouble about that. He\r\nscarcely recognized the fact, and presently he recognized nothing. He\r\nhad been doped. One of these new friends had done the business, and an\r\nhour later he found himself lying on a couch in Hakluyt's inner office,\r\nof all places in the world, his pockets empty and his throat like a\r\nfiery furnace.\r\n\r\nHe recognized at once his position. He had been robbed and left in\r\nthe street and had managed to reach Hakluyt's by that instinct for a\r\nknown place common to homing pigeons and drunken men, an instinct that\r\nin the man is much more tricky than in the bird, as in the case of\r\nFloyd, who, instead of finding himself in his rooms, found himself at\r\nHakluyt's.\r\n\r\nHis mind, as he lay there on the couch, was terribly lucid. He\r\nremembered everything up to a certain point.\r\n\r\nIt was still daylight, so that his intoxication must have passed away\r\nvery quickly, as it does in those instances where it is produced by\r\na doper and through the medium of a \"knock-out drop\" placed in the\r\nvictim's drink; but Floyd knew nothing of this. He did not suspect that\r\nhe had been doped by some scoundrel for the purpose of robbery. He only\r\nrecognized that he had been drunk and incapable, and, to use the old\r\nterm so unfair to animals, had made a beast of himself.\r\n\r\nThe awful depression that comes after drink or drugs had a hold upon\r\nhim, and the unfair spirit that waits upon depression of this sort\r\nbegan to exercise its power.\r\n\r\nIt showed him the vision of Isbel standing on the reef against a\r\nbackground of blue and burning sea; it showed him the coconut trees and\r\nbreadfruits, their fronds and foliage moving in the wind; it showed\r\nhim all that was brilliant and fresh and pure in that extraordinary\r\nlife through which he had passed out there, away from civilization and\r\nits dirt, and then it showed himself lying in Hakluyt's dusty office\r\nrecovering from drink and fortunate in not having been jailed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to his simple mind that he had sinned against Isbel and that\r\nhe never, never could rise from his degradation and look in her face\r\nagain. All his homesickness for the island came upon him like a wave,\r\nand he was endeavoring to raise himself on his arm to leave the couch\r\nwhen a voice from the outer office made him lie down again.\r\n\r\nIt was Hakluyt's voice. He had just entered, and Floyd, as he lay,\r\nheard the door of the outer office close.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Hakluyt, who seemed to be continuing a conversation begun\r\noutside, \"id is just so. There is noding to fear. Wait for a moment,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\nHe came to the door of the inner office where Floyd was lying, pushed\r\nit more widely open, and peeped in.\r\n\r\nFloyd, more from shame than any other reason, lay with his eyes closed.\r\n\r\nHakluyt stood looking at him for a few seconds, then he closed the door.\r\n\r\nFloyd instantly opened his eyes and sat up on the couch.\r\n\r\nHakluyt and the other man, whoever he might be, had been talking\r\nabout him. Of that he felt certain. He had no concrete evidence to\r\ngo upon, yet he felt sure that he had been under discussion and that\r\nthey were discussing him now. His ego had become abnormally sensitive,\r\nfortunately for him. He felt sure that his disgraceful conduct was the\r\nsubject of their talk, and the overmastering desire to hear the worst\r\nthat could be said of him prompted him to leave the couch, approach the\r\ndoor, and put his ear to the paneling. He heard Hakluyt's voice and\r\nevery word that he said distinctly.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Captain Luckman,\" said Hakluyt, \"when I say a thing I mean\r\nid. You need have no fear. Schumer will see that there is no evidence\r\nagainst you. You will dispose of the young man so that no trouble will\r\nbe made, no questions asked. You will not raise the price on me on that\r\naccount. You run no risk. That is all Schumer's work, and no blood need\r\nbe spilled. Schumer is nod the man to make any blunder. Two hundred\r\npounds now and two hundred when you get back. That is my uldimatum, and\r\nwhat have you to do for that--noding, _absolutely_ noding.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not troubling about what Schumer does to the blighter,\" came\r\nLuckman's voice. \"I'm thinking of myself, and I say it's not enough.\r\nTwo-fifty down and two-fifty when I get back is _my_ ultimatum, and\r\npoor enough pay it is for a job like that.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd heard Hakluyt laugh. Just a single laugh, mirthless as a rap on a\r\ncoffin lid.\r\n\r\n\"So you would dictate terms to me,\" said he. \"Why, God bless my soul,\"\r\nhis voice rising in inflection, \"suppose I order you from my office,\r\nsuppose I say to you, 'Get clear out of this place, Captain Luckman,\r\nand never you ender id again,' hey? Suppose I say to you, 'Very well,\r\nCaptain Luckman, all those papers in my hands go to the owners of the\r\n_Morning Star_. Sent anonymous.' Suppose----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stow that!\" came Luckman's voice. \"Suppose I put the mouth of a\r\nrevolver at your head and blow out your dirty brains? I'd do that same\r\nas I'd poison a rat, if you cut any capers with my affairs. You're not\r\ngoing to frighten me with threats. Put me beyond a certain point and\r\nI'd do you up before the authorities could nab me, and if they did nab\r\nme I'd croak you when I came out of quod. Talk like a man to a man or\r\nI'll leave your office and let you do your own dirty work. Who else is\r\nthere in Sydney you could get?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hundreds,\" said Hakluyt.\r\n\r\n\"Not one,\" replied Luckman. \"Not one who would not either mess it or\r\ngive the show away in drink sometime or another. Five hundred is my\r\nprice. Two-fifty down, two-fifty when I land back. Not a halfpenny less\r\nwill I take.\"\r\n\r\nIn the momentary silence that followed, Floyd heard a drawer opened,\r\nand then came Hakluyt's voice counting: \"One, two, three, four--_and_\r\nfive.\"\r\n\r\nThen Luckman's:\r\n\r\n\"_And_ five. Right you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe money was being paid over, and from the chinking sound it was being\r\npaid in gold, five bags of fifty sovereigns each, evidently.\r\n\r\nFloyd did not wait for any more. He went back to the couch. He had\r\nforgotten his position, he had forgotten the drinking bout, he no\r\nlonger even felt the headache and the parching thirst that had\r\ntormented him on waking. Hakluyt and Schumer had made a plan to get\r\nrid of him. That was all he knew for the moment. The idea excluded\r\neverything else by its monstrosity and strangeness.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that a plot is on foot against one's life is the most\r\nsoul-stirring discovery that a man can make. The knowledge that one is\r\nan object of enmity is always disturbing. It unsettles the placidity of\r\nthe ego, almost more than the discovery that one is an object of love.\r\nIt also raises the temperature of the soul.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery that one is plotted against with a view to one's\r\nremoval from the world is a heart-chilling discovery which at all\r\nevents in the first moments reduces the temperature of the soul and\r\nbody both.\r\n\r\nFloyd, taking his place on the couch again, closed his eyes. He heard\r\nthe two men go out; then after a moment he heard Hakluyt return.\r\n\r\nHakluyt opened the door and looked in on him, and Floyd, moving and\r\npretending to wake up, rubbed his eyes. Then he sat up, asked in a\r\nconfused manner where he was, got on his legs, pretended to stagger,\r\nand made for the door.\r\n\r\nHakluyt, nothing loath to get rid of him, followed him to the stair top.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you off to now?\" inquired Hakluyt, as the other went down\r\nthe stairs clutching the banister tightly.\r\n\r\n\"Going to have a drink,\" replied Floyd. \"See you in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said Hakluyt. \"Take care of yourself.\"\r\n\r\nIn the street Floyd turned into the nearest bar, drank a bottle of\r\nsoda water, and, having sat for a moment to collect his wits, started\r\nfor his rooms. He had now entirely recovered mastery of himself. His\r\ndiscovery about Hakluyt was finer than any pick-me-up or tonic, and his\r\nmind before the problem clearly stated by fate had little inclination\r\nfor sleep.\r\n\r\nThe problem itself, though clearly stated, was intricate and in some\r\nrespects obscure. If Hakluyt and Schumer wanted to clear him out of the\r\npearl business, if they were scoundrels enough to plot his destruction,\r\nwhy did they not commit the act themselves without calling in a third\r\nman? He could imagine no answer to this question that satisfied him,\r\nyet there were two answers that might have been put forward by a man\r\nwith a knowledge of Schumer and Hakluyt, a knowledge of psychology and\r\na knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nFirstly, neither Schumer nor Hakluyt might be murderers in an active\r\nsense. Very few men are capable--God be thanked--of taking a fellow\r\nman's life in cold blood with their own hands. Schumer was without\r\ndoubt a man of sensibility and parts. Hakluyt, though without parts or\r\nsensibility, was not of the active type of scoundrel. Both of these\r\nmen might be capable of planning the destruction of another man, but\r\nneither would be likely to do the work himself.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in a business of this sort it is always safer for the\r\nmurderer to employ an agent than to act himself.\r\n\r\nIt is the assassin who leaves traces, the assassin who is followed, the\r\nassassin who is hanged.\r\n\r\nOf course, he may accuse his employer, but an employer of the type of\r\nSchumer or of Hakluyt is not likely to give an agent any chance to make\r\nevidence against him. He had paid Luckman in gold, and when the job was\r\nfinished he would pay him in gold. Gold cannot be traced--and that is\r\none of the greatest pities in the world.\r\n\r\nFloyd could see nothing very clearly in the whole of this business with\r\nthe exception of the fact that foul play was to be used against him,\r\nbut he saw that fact clearly enough. Leaving the problem of Schumer and\r\nHakluyt aside, he tried to imagine what method Luckman might possibly\r\nemploy. The remainder of the money was not to be paid to Luckman until\r\nhis return. Return from where? There could be only one answer to\r\nthat--from the sea.\r\n\r\nLuckman would sail with the _Southern Cross_, be put on board either as\r\nmate or supercargo; and on the voyage he would do what he was paid to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ would most likely never reach the island. An\r\naccident would happen to Floyd, and she would return to Sydney. Luckman\r\nwould be paid off for his job, and Hakluyt, taking charge of the\r\nschooner, would sail for the island and shake hands with Schumer over\r\nthe fact that they two were the sole possessors of the place and its\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nAnd what would happen to Isbel?\r\n\r\nAt this thought a wave of fury rose in his soul against the men whom he\r\nimagined to be plotting his destruction.\r\n\r\nHe half rose from his bed, and had Hakluyt appeared at that moment it\r\nwould have been a very bad thing for the shipowner.\r\n\r\nThen he lay down, a deep determination in his heart to deal with this\r\nmatter in the only way it could be dealt with satisfactorily, to match\r\ncunning against cunning, and force, at the proper moment, against force.\r\n\r\nHe determined to say nothing and do nothing to arouse any uneasiness\r\nor suspicion in Hakluyt, to welcome Luckman on board, and then to deal\r\nwith Luckman when they were clear of the Heads.\r\n\r\nIf Luckman were put on board as mate or supercargo the matter would be\r\neasy, but if Luckman were placed over him as captain it would be much\r\nmore difficult.\r\n\r\nIf Hakluyt were to suggest such a thing he determined to oppose it, to\r\nstand on his dignity and refuse utterly to give up his post as chief in\r\ncommand to a stranger.\r\n\r\nThen as he lay down again the thought came to him what a miraculous and\r\nprovidential thing it was that he had gone out fishing that day and\r\nfallen in with the bibulous stranger. He had been robbed, it is true,\r\nof a few pounds, but that was a very cheap price to pay for his life.\r\n\r\nFloyd, without being a professedly religious man, had a deep and\r\nintuitive belief in a God that rules the world and deals out justice\r\nand protects--though sometimes in a roundabout way--the innocent. He\r\nfelt that Providence had a hand in this affair, yet he was not of\r\nthe type that believes in a Providence who works single-handed. He\r\ndetermined that in this matter he would give Providence all the help he\r\ncould, and having come to this determination he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nCARDON\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Floyd presented himself early at the office of Hakluyt\r\n& Son, and Hakluyt received him with some very bald jokes about his\r\ncondition on the day before.\r\n\r\nFloyd was not in a temper to take them, and indicated as much. Then\r\nthey fell to discussing stores and the sailing of the _Southern Cross_.\r\nThe stores were all on board, and the crew were ready. \"I had thought\r\nof your sailing on Friday,\" said Hakluyt, \"but Friday is not a good\r\nday; Thursday is better; that is the day after to-morrow. Will you be\r\nready to sail on Thursday?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd asked nothing better, and said so; then he waited, expecting\r\nHakluyt to broach the subject of Captain Luckman, but Hakluyt did not\r\nsay a word about that gentleman. They talked of a good many things, but\r\nLuckman's name was never mentioned.\r\n\r\nFloyd left the office perplexed and more disturbed than he would have\r\nbeen had Hakluyt announced his intention of superseding him as captain\r\nby appointing Luckman to the post.\r\n\r\nWas Luckman to be sprung upon him at the last moment? Apparently so.\r\n\r\nHe turned down Market Street. So deep in thought was he that the\r\npassers-by were unnoticed. He walked without aim or object for some\r\ntwo hundred yards till at the corner of Fore Street he was brought to\r\nreality by a hand laid on his arm.\r\n\r\nHe turned, and found himself face to face with a tall, bearded man,\r\nwearing a slouch hat, roughly dressed yet somehow well-to-do looking,\r\nbronzed, hearty, and healthy with sun and open-air life.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Cardon!\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"You passed me as if you didn't know me,\" said the other, laughing.\r\n\"And I'm Captain Cardon no more; plain Jack Cardon, gold prospector,\r\nand down on his luck--that's me. Where the deuce have you sprung from?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't look particularly down on your luck,\" said Floyd. \"Me? I've\r\nsprung from the islands--let's go somewhere and have a talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You come with me,\" said Cardon, turning and leading the way down Fore\r\nStreet. \"Well, this is a bit of good fortune. I was crazy for the sight\r\nof some man I knew other than the bar bummers round here. It's four\r\nyears since we met, isn't it? And I owe you that five dollars still;\r\nlost your postal address, or did you give me one?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd laughed.\r\n\r\nHe had sailed under Cardon in one of the blackbird freighters, and knew\r\nhim for what he was--one of the best, most desperate, and irresponsible\r\nof men. He had parted from him at 'Frisco in a bar in a haze of tobacco\r\nsmoke, Cardon, relieved of his responsibilities in life by reason of a\r\nquarrel with his owners, sitting on a high stool by the counter, a full\r\nglass beside him, and leading the chorus of \"A Hot Time in the Old\r\nTown To-night.\"\r\n\r\nHe was to have seen Cardon the next day, but they had failed to meet,\r\nand then the sea had separated them. He remembered the five dollars;\r\nthey fluttered up to his mind now--ghosts of silver coins forgotten\r\nbeneath the waters of memory.\r\n\r\nCardon was like a sea breeze to him in his present state of mind, and\r\nhe followed as Cardon led the way through a garden where seats and\r\ntables were set out and into a bar where more seats and tables faced a\r\nbar counter gorgeous with colored bottles.\r\n\r\nThere were island spears and head-dresses on the walls, and photographs\r\nof towns sea-washed and backed by coconut palms.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of the islands spreads across the Pacific even to the bars\r\nof Sydney and San Francisco, where the trade winds blow in mariners\r\nbronzed by the sun and salt, where even the traders carry with them in\r\ntheir hands something more than copra or gold.\r\n\r\nThe place was almost empty at this hour, and Cardon, at Floyd's\r\nrequest, called for soft drinks. Floyd produced cigars.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cardon, when he had lit up, \"I'm blessed if this doesn't\r\nlay over everything. To think of you and me parting at Black Jack's\r\non the Barbary Coast four years and more ago and promising to meet\r\nthe next day, and then meeting here, just as though we'd only parted\r\nyesterday--what have you been doing with yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you?\" asked Floyd. \"You tell me your yarn, and I'll tell\r\nmine. I want a little time to think about mine, for if I'm not mistaken\r\nit will have more to do with you than you think. I may have an offer\r\nto make you; however, that will do to talk of afterward.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your offer has anything to do with money, I'm open to it,\" said\r\nCardon. \"What have I been doing since we parted? Everything and\r\nnothing. I made a fortune the next year in Brazil--mining. And I lost\r\nit six months after I got it. I was done by a partner, and pretty nigh\r\ndone up. Then I took to the sea again. A cattle boat, and I was boss\r\nof it. I was tending the cattle--fact. But I didn't grumble. I like\r\ncattle; they're a long sight honester than men. Well, after that I\r\ndid some railway work in Central America, and after that I went oil\r\nprospecting with a young fellow who paid for kit and accouterments and\r\ndied on my hands with malaria before we got a sign of what we were\r\nlooking for. He had no relatives, and he gave me all the money on him\r\nbefore he died, which wasn't much--some seven hundred dollars. Then\r\nI turned up here on the hunt for gold, and found none; did some more\r\nrailway work and got good pay for it, straggled back to Sydney and\r\nstruck you in the street. That's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're looking well on it,\" said Floyd; \"you don't look a day\r\nolder than when I met you last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I don't feel it,\" said Cardon. \"If I'd been living in a city all\r\nthe time it would have been different, but the open air keeps one\r\nalive. If I'd managed to keep that fortune, I'd have mostlike been dead\r\nby this time between wine and women. As it is, I'm liver than when I\r\nstarted--I don't care a hang for money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why are you always hunting for it then?\" asked Floyd, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"For the pleasure of the hunt,\" replied Cardon. \"What makes a man hunt\r\nbears and spend thousands of dollars on guns and tents and guides, as\r\nI've seen some of these N' York chaps do? He doesn't love bears; he\r\nhunts them for the fun of the thing. Same with me and dollars; I don't\r\nlove them, but I love hunting for them. It's the same with most men, I\r\nreckon. Well, what's your yarn?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd tipped the ash off his cigar. All this time, while listening to\r\nCardon, he had been making up his mind. He, like Cardon, did not love\r\nmoney. He reckoned that his share of the pearling business and the\r\npearls, even if he were to divide it equally with Cardon, would give\r\nhim enough money to start in life at some more profitable business than\r\nsailoring. He was bitterly in need of friendship and a strong man's\r\nhelp, and he decided to tell Cardon everything, invoke his help, and\r\noffer him half shares.\r\n\r\n\"What I'm going to tell you,\" said he, \"sounds like a yarn out of a\r\nbook, but it's the truth. Some months ago I left 'Frisco, bound for the\r\nislands in a schooner owned by a man named Coxon. The _Cormorant_ was\r\nher name. She was an unlucky ship.\" He told of the fire, of the island,\r\nof Schumer and Isbel, of the pearls--he told everything worth telling\r\nabout the whole business; and, when he had finished, the effect of the\r\nyarn on Cardon was very evident, for that gentleman for once in his\r\nlife was dumb.\r\n\r\n\"But that's not all,\" went on Floyd. \"Something happened yesterday that\r\nputs a topknot on the whole business.\"\r\n\r\nHe told of the conversation he had overheard in Hakluyt's office, and\r\nof the act of treachery which he believed to be impending.\r\n\r\n\"That's clear enough,\" said Cardon; \"they mean to do you up. Who is\r\nthis Luckman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know him from Adam. Didn't even see him, only heard his voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's bad,\" said Cardon; \"and you say the _Southern Cross_ sails the\r\nday after to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, on Thursday.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are bound to go in her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Hakluyt said anything to you about Luckman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you are the skipper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"All Kanakas.\"\r\n\r\n\"All Kanakas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how in the nation are you going to work her single-handed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, easy enough. I have a chap called Mountain Joe; he's a Kanaka, but\r\nhe has picked up a bit of navigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cardon, \"that simplifies matters a bit, for Hakluyt can't\r\nship this blighter as a Kanaka, can't slide him aboard as an extra\r\nhand. He must ship him openly; most likely he'll do it at the last\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I'm thinking,\" said Floyd. \"He'll dump him onto me just\r\nas I'm getting up anchor, and I can't refuse, for he's sure to make up\r\nsome yarn. My only course is to take him and then deal with him when I\r\nget to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's easier said than done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless you shoot him right off and chuck him overboard, which is\r\nimpossible; or put him in irons, which, with a Kanaka crew, would be\r\nrisky; or maroon him on some rock or other with a beaker of water and\r\na bag of bread, which is also a bit risky. No, I should take him right\r\nalong and front him with this Schumer, tell them they are found out,\r\nand at the first sign of a move on their part--shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's easy to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, easier to say than do; yet if it was me I'd do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Floyd, \"will you come into this business with me?\r\nI'll give you half profits.\"\r\n\r\nCardon did not reply for a moment. He took a pull at his drink, wiped\r\nhis mouth with the back of his hand, looked at the top of his cigar,\r\nand then said, quite simply:\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd stretched out his hand and they shook.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would,\" said Floyd. \"And now I'll tell you something\r\nelse--it's not the money I'm thinking of so much as that girl I told\r\nyou of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isbel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Isbel. I'm--I'm----\"\r\n\r\n\"Soft on her,\" said Cardon, laughing. \"Well, you're not the first\r\nto get tangled with a girl. All the same, I wish we were fighting\r\nthis business out without petticoats in it. I have a holy dread of\r\npetticoats. On shore and after a cruise I don't mind; but they're no\r\nuse afloat or where fighting has to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't they?\" said Floyd. \"I'd sooner have Isbel backing me in a row\r\nthan most men. I told you she helped me in my scrap with those scamps,\r\nbut I did not tell you all. She can shoot straight, and she doesn't\r\nknow fear. She backed me right through the business without turning\r\na hair, and we were fighting half a day and the whole of a night.\r\nFighting? Yes! I have never known what it meant before--shut up in a\r\nhouse with nearly half a hundred Solomon Islanders outside all yelling\r\nlike fiends and mad to have one's blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cardon, \"I expect you'll have some fighting to match that\r\nbefore we have done with this business. If this man Schumer is anything\r\nlike what you say, and if this man Luckman is anything like Schumer, we\r\nwill have our work cut out for us by a fancy tailor. What did you say\r\nthese pearls were worth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worth? I don't know the exact figures, but Schumer has pearls there\r\non the island now that I reckon must be at least worth twenty thousand\r\npounds. I'm figuring on the values he suggested, and he's a man who\r\nknows something of pearls, and he's not a man who exaggerates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to halve your pearls,\" said Cardon. \"I reckon my\r\nshare in the business will be the whole of Schumer's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of Schumer's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of Schumer's.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, see here,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"You intend to take Schumer's share from him?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I said.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would that be fair? He has worked deuced hard; he discovered the\r\noyster beds----\"\r\n\r\n\"And he betrayed you, and is only waiting there on this island of yours\r\nto help to do you in.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" said Floyd, \"I don't like the idea of stripping him if\r\nwe get the better of him. It may be foolish, but I've worked alongside\r\nof him, and, though I believe he is the biggest scoundrel God ever put\r\nhair on, I don't like the idea of taking his share of the pearls from\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we have done with Schumer,\" replied Cardon grimly, \"I don't\r\nsuspect he'll want pearls. We'll leave the matter till then, for it's\r\non the cards that when he has done with us we won't want pearls,\r\neither. So let's not divide the stuff up till the business is over. How\r\nare you off for arms and ammunition?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a revolver at my rooms and half a packet of cartridges, and\r\nthere is a rifle on board in my cabin with a hundred cartridges for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Cardon. \"And I have my old friend Joe.\" He opened his\r\ncoat and showed a navy revolver strapped in its case to his belt. He\r\nslipped the long, beautifully kept weapon from its case and stroked it\r\nlovingly. \"This is him. This chap would stop a hippopotamus. He's a\r\nman's weapon--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's big enough,\" said Floyd, as Cardon returned Joe to his case, \"and\r\nI hope to goodness we'll pull this thing through without having to use\r\nhim. I'm not a coward, but I hate killing.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" replied Cardon, \"till it comes to the point. Well, now we've\r\nsettled about the arms, let's fix another matter. How am I to book a\r\npassage on the _Southern Cross_?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking that out the whole time,\" replied Floyd. \"Suppose\r\nI go to Hakluyt and say that I have a friend I want to take with me,\r\nhe'll buck at the idea at once, the same as if I told him I wanted an\r\nextra hand to help in the navigating; and it would be quite natural,\r\ntoo, for the whole of this business is a secret, and if another white\r\nman was taken on board, no matter who or what he was, it might mean the\r\nsecret getting out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said Cardon.\r\n\r\n\"The only way,\" continued Floyd, \"is to take you without Hakluyt\r\nknowing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stowaway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There are two cabins off the main cabin--the captain's and the\r\nmate's. Only one is used; for Mountain Joe, the fellow I told you\r\nabout, berths with the crew. I can take you aboard to-morrow night.\r\nI'll tell Joe next morning you have gone ashore in a shore boat. You\r\ncan stay in the mate's cabin till we get the anchor up.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cardon, \"in your cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" asked Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"This way: Suppose old man Hakluyt arrives off with this Luckman at the\r\nlast moment. You can't refuse to take him; you don't _want_ to refuse.\r\nWell, naturally, he'll want the mate's cabin, and you can let him have\r\nit without any bother.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Luckman may be sprung on you before that,\" said Cardon. \"In which case\r\nwe must make some other arrangement about my getting on board; but, as\r\nfar as we know, what we have decided on will stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you staying in Sydney?\" asked Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cardon, \"I only arrived last night, and I put up at a\r\ntavern on the Leicester Road. I left all my gear there. It isn't much,\r\nand it won't take many porters to fetch it down to the wharfside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Floyd, \"you had better come and stay at my place. I can\r\nget you a room, and you can put your things among my baggage which I'll\r\nsend on board to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\nCardon agreed to this, and, finishing their drinks, they left the place\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nPETER WILLIAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Floyd called on Hakluyt, while Cardon, who had accompanied\r\nhim, waited outside the office.\r\n\r\nFloyd was half an hour in the office, and when he came out Cardon\r\nfollowed till he had turned the street corner, and there joined him.\r\n\r\n\"I can't make it out,\" said Floyd; \"I've said good-by to him, and I'm\r\nto start to-morrow morning at sunup, and not a word did he say about\r\nLuckman or anyone else, not a hint that he was going to send an extra\r\nhand on board. What's the meaning of it? Did I dream that business in\r\nthe office, or was it real?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I guess you'll find it real enough to satisfy you before long,\"\r\nsaid Cardon. \"You see, there's one solid reason behind all this that\r\nwill make it work out different from a dream, and that reason is\r\npearls. You say you have a third share in the business, which share,\r\nif the business is worth twenty thousand as it stands, would work out\r\nclose on seven thousand pounds. Now, if Hakluyt is a shipowner, he's\r\na scoundrel; and if he's a scoundrel, he'll do a lot to secure seven\r\nthousand pounds. Why, men sink ships every day for less than that; and\r\nsinking a ship is a lot more risky business than doing up an unknown\r\nsailorman. You needn't be uneasy on that score. You dreamed a real\r\ndream. You see, you are worth killing, that's the long and short of\r\nit; for not only are you worth the seven thousand, but you are worth a\r\nthird of all that pearl lagoon will bring in the future, which may be a\r\nlot. I wish we could get to know something about this Luckman. Suppose\r\nwe make inquiries?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom could we ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one who knows the port. Peter Williams, he's the man; he keeps\r\na bar down on the waterside. I knew him in Melbourne years ago, and I\r\ngave him a call when I came here first, and he's a friendly sort of\r\ncustomer. Don't you do any talking; leave it all to me.\"\r\n\r\nThey took their way down to the waterside, and here, before a rather\r\ndingy bar with the name Peter Williams done in huge letters on the\r\nfront, Cardon paused.\r\n\r\n\"This is the place,\" said he, \"and we'd better go in separate. You\r\nsee, if Williams by any chance was to know Luckman and tell him two\r\nstrangers had been inquiring about him, Luckman would ask for a\r\ndescription of them, and might spot you. Don't pretend to know me, then\r\nwe will be on the safe side.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Williams, a red-headed Welshman in shirt sleeves, was leaning\r\nacross the bar talking to Cardon when Floyd entered. There was no one\r\nelse in the place.\r\n\r\nFloyd glanced round him with disgust. The walls were dingy and showed a\r\ndado of grease marks above the benches where the heads of customers had\r\nrested against the wall. The atmosphere was heavy with stale tobacco\r\nand the smell of gin and sawdust.\r\n\r\nHe called for a drink, and took his seat on one of the benches while\r\nPeter Williams returned to his conversation with Cardon.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't have him here,\" said Peter. \"Not that I'm a prying\r\nman into another man's character, for a publican has nothing to do\r\nwith the character of his customers. No, it's not that; it's my other\r\ncustomers I'm thinking of. If he was to come in here or be seen here\r\nregular, I'd lose my trade--and no wonder. He's never been had by the\r\nlaw, but he's got the name of having drowned more sailormen than is\r\ngood for him. It's so. He's lost three ships out of this port alone,\r\nand God He knows how many more, and has done it so artful that the law\r\ncan't touch him. And still he gets ships. What's that you say--you\r\nwonder that sailormen will sign on under him? How are they to pick\r\nand choose? Give them drink enough, and they'd sign on under Satan.\r\nAnd there's more than that to it. The _Baralong_, she was known to be\r\nrotten right down to her garboard strake and Huffer was her captain,\r\nand he was known to be as bad as her; and there were two jacks in\r\nhere drinking and talking her over and talking Huffer over and giving\r\nthem both their proper names. Well, next day both those chaps signed\r\non under Huffer, and the day after they were off to Valparaiso on the\r\n_Baralong_. I believe some of those chaps would sooner sign on in a\r\ncrazy vessel than a sound one. They seem to like the danger. All the\r\nsame, when they sit down to their drinks they don't want to have the\r\ntaste of their liquor spoiled by the sight of chaps like Huffer or\r\nLuckman. They'll sail under them, but they won't drink near them.\r\nThat's the plain truth.\"\r\n\r\nCardon, after a little while, went out, and presently Floyd followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Floyd, when they met in the street, \"you've heard\r\nLuckman's character. What do you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never think about men's characters, or bother a cent about anything\r\nthan the man himself,\" replied Cardon. \"A man may have a tremendous big\r\ncharacter--or, better, call it reputation for being a holy terror; and\r\nwhen you overhaul him you may find him to be a merchantman painted in\r\nimitation of a pirate, or, again, he may have the reputation of being a\r\nvery quiet man indeed; then you take his lid off, and--oh, my!\r\n\r\n\"I've seen a little bit of a man who looked like a parson with the pip,\r\na little bit of a chap with a pale face that looked as if it had been\r\ntrying all its life to raise a beard and then given up the business\r\nas unworkable. Well, that chap swam out to a ship somewhere down the\r\nChile coast, talked the crew over, and made them mutiny. With the crew\r\nhe took the ship, and with the ship he took a town, and with the town\r\nhe'd have taken Chile, I believe, only the Chilean government chipped\r\nin in time and sent troops and beat him in a big battle near Valdivia\r\nand then hanged him at Concepción. I saw him hanged. Benken was his\r\nname--an American from nowhere, with a past history that showed nothing\r\nexcept the fact that he had once been a prisoner in Numea and had\r\nescaped by raising a revolt and murdering the guards. Yet to look at\r\nhim he was quite a quiet man; might have been a shopman.\r\n\r\n\"No; as I was saying, there's nothing counts but the man himself, and\r\nby the man himself I don't mean a man's character or face, but just\r\nthe something that drives him on. If he hasn't got that something, he\r\nmay have the face of a Napoleon Bonaparte or the character of a white\r\nlamb--it doesn't matter, he arrives nowhere. Now, from all accounts,\r\nthe man I fear most in this business is not Luckman but Schumer.\r\nSchumer seems to be all there from what you tell me, and he doesn't\r\nseem to make much show. Is he a quiet sort of chap?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fair spoken and easy in his talk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the sort of man that gives trouble. Well, we will see what we\r\nwill see when the time comes; and now I propose we go and have a bit of\r\ndinner. It's the last we'll have on shore for some time.\"\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Floyd, having paid off his landlord, called a porter and\r\nhad his gear, together with Cardon's, taken down to the wharfside. Here\r\nthey took a shore boat and rowed off to the _Southern Cross_. Mountain\r\nJoe was hanging over the rail as they approached. He and the whole\r\nKanaka ship's company had been specially provided for when on shore\r\nby Hakluyt. He had sent the whole lot, in fact, under the guidance of\r\none of his men, to a fishing village down the coast, there to amuse\r\nthemselves till the time of sailing. He did not want them knocking\r\nround Sydney and maybe talking, though indeed they knew little enough\r\nas to the truth concerning the pearl fishery.\r\n\r\nMountain Joe grinned when he saw Floyd; then he lowered the ladder for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely late afternoon, the great harbor like a sheet of\r\nglass, the gulls crying and wheeling above the water and the trees of\r\nthe shore and the far-stretching hills green against a sky of summer.\r\nCardon, when he stepped on deck, looked round him with approval. The\r\n_Southern Cross_ was not a fast boat, as schooners go, but she was\r\nonly some six years old and she had been well looked after. Built by\r\nMcDowell, of Sydney, than whom no better schooner builder exists, she\r\nhad been laid down to the plans of a private firm with ideas of their\r\nown, as though one were to go to Mr. Pool or Messrs. Stultz for a suit\r\nof clothes to be made according to one's own ideas of cut and style.\r\n\r\nThe result was that the _Southern Cross_ turned out to be something of\r\na failure as far as speed was concerned, but a splendid sea boat. Every\r\nbit of stuff in her was good, and spars, rigging, and hull would have\r\nstood the criticism of an English navy dockyard inspection.\r\n\r\nFloyd took Cardon down below and showed him the main cabin and the\r\ncabins of the captain and the first and second mate.\r\n\r\nThe captain's cabin had two bunks--an upper and a lower one--and they\r\narranged that Cardon should sleep that night in the upper bunk, which\r\nhad curtains.\r\n\r\n\"If Hakluyt should turn up before we start,\" said Cardon, \"I can lie in\r\nthe upper bunk with the curtains drawn and you can say I'm some of your\r\ngear you have stowed there. There's no fear of any of those tomfool\r\nKanakas coming and poking their noses in here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'll look to that. The fellow that acts as steward is a born fool,\r\nand if he did see you he wouldn't take notice; and, anyhow, you're on\r\nboard, and, Hakluyt or no Hakluyt, you are going to sail with me.\"\r\n\r\nHe got out the spirits and some cigars, and they sat smoking and\r\ntalking till the steward came in to light the lamps.\r\n\r\nCardon, at sight of this person, felt no uneasiness; he was of\r\nthe stupid type of native--\"wore his mouth open,\" to use Cardon's\r\nexpression, and was afflicted with deafness due to adenoids.\r\n\r\nThey came up on deck after dark, and sat smoking and watching the\r\nlights of Sydney and the harbor all spangled with star reflections and\r\nthe anchor lights of the shipping.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cardon, \"if old man Hakluyt had been intending to come off\r\nfor the purpose of dumping Luckman on you, I guess he'd have come by\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never know,\" replied Floyd. \"That sort of reptile is pretty\r\ncunning, and I don't give up a fear of surprise till I'm outside the\r\nHeads. Look! There's a shore boat come off, and it's making for us if\r\nI'm not mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nCardon looked in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" said he.\r\n\r\nWithout another word he turned and dived below.\r\n\r\nFloyd, quite sure as to the other's ability to take cover, remained on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nHe could see the boat now clearly as she drew near across the starlit\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThere were four fellows rowing, and a figure in the stern steering. It\r\nwas Hakluyt alone and unaccompanied by Luckman.\r\n\r\nHakluyt came on board and gave Floyd good evening, inquired if the crew\r\nwere all right, and then came below.\r\n\r\nFloyd, who preceded him, looked anxiously round, but Cardon had removed\r\nall traces of himself, and the door of the captain's cabin was closed.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Hakluyt, as he took his seat and a drink, \"here's luck\r\nto the voyage and a quick return with another cargo of shell, though\r\nI expect it is Schumer himself who will come next to Sydney. You will\r\ngive him my very good respects?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Floyd, \"and perhaps the next time I meet you will\r\nbe on the island. You are sure to pay us another visit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" replied Hakluyt, \"and maybe not. I am getting old for sea\r\nwork, but I shall always be glad to welcome you in Sydney.\"\r\n\r\nHe produced a pocketbook, and they went into accounts as to stores, et\r\ncetera. This business took them some half hour or so, and then Hakluyt\r\ntook another cigar and talked on indifferent subjects till it was time\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nHe shook hands effusively with Floyd on deck, and wished him good luck\r\nagain as he went down the side.\r\n\r\nFloyd watched the boat draw off and the oars making rings on the\r\nstar-spangled water; then he returned to the cabin, where he found\r\nCardon released from his prison and seated at the table.\r\n\r\n\"He's gone,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"And no sign of Luckman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cardon, \"it's beyond me. However, we're not out of Sydney\r\nharbor yet, and there's no knowing what may happen before we are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE OPEN SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nFloyd did not take the trouble to speak to Mountain Joe about Cardon's\r\npresence on board.\r\n\r\nCardon got into the upper bunk at about eleven o'clock and went\r\npromptly to sleep. As for Floyd, he could neither sleep nor lie still.\r\nDuring his stay in Sydney, he had been restless enough at times, but he\r\nhad never felt like this. Ever since his departure from the island the\r\nidea of Isbel had followed him and been with him now clear and close,\r\nnow more remote and partly obscured from him by everyday affairs.\r\n\r\nTo-night she haunted him.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of fears and imaginings rose in his mind. He had never known\r\nthe extent of his love for her till just this moment, on the eve of his\r\nreturn. Suppose when he got back he found she was not there. Suppose\r\nthe natives had revolted again; suppose that Schumer, playing every\r\none false and on the chance of a passing ship, had gone off from the\r\nisland, taking the pearls with him and Isbel. Suppose--suppose----There\r\nwas no end to the suppositions that rose up before his mind as he paced\r\nthe floor of the main cabin and listened to Cardon snoring in his bunk.\r\n\r\nCardon, in his idea of passing himself off as baggage, had not\r\nreckoned on his capacity for snoring. Floyd, however, did not trouble\r\nabout it; even if Hakluyt were suddenly to come on board and see Cardon\r\nin the flesh, let alone hearing him snoring, it would not much matter.\r\n\r\nIn his present frame of mind, he would have bundled Hakluyt down the\r\nmain hatch and closed it on him had he appeared to give any trouble.\r\n\r\nHe came on deck, leaving Cardon to his dreams, and paced the planks,\r\nstill engaged in suppositions as to Isbel.\r\n\r\nThen the night wind, balmy and warm, blew the evil fancies from his\r\nmind and restored its tone. Nothing could have happened in the few\r\nweeks that had elapsed since his departure. Isbel was well able to take\r\ncare of herself, and as for the natives, they were not likely to try\r\nany more tricks with Sru dead and Schumer in command. The real danger\r\nwas to come, and its name was Luckman. That was nothing. With Cardon at\r\nhis elbow, he felt able to cope with a hundred Luckmans and Schumers.\r\nHe was forewarned. Fate had declared for him--or so it seemed.\r\n\r\nHe remained on deck till dawn began to break upon the harbor, then he\r\nwent down and woke Cardon.\r\n\r\nBefore going down, he had stirred up the cook and ordered coffee to be\r\nsent to the main cabin; and while they were drinking this they heard a\r\nboat coming alongside, and Mountain Joe shouted down the hatchway that\r\nthe pilot was coming on board.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon I'd better stay hid till we are clear of the harbor,\" said\r\nCardon. \"There's no use in running risks. Up with you, and interview\r\nthe pilot and get the anchor out of the mud as quick as you can. Give\r\nme a word when you have dropped him. You won't have far to look for me.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd went up and found the pilot already on deck. The wind was fair;\r\nall the port regulations had been complied with, and there was nothing\r\nto hold them but the anchor.\r\n\r\nCardon, down below, could hear the clank of the windlass pawls as the\r\nslack of the anchor chain was being hove in, the feet of the fellows on\r\ndeck running to orders, their voices as they hauled on the halyards,\r\nand then again the welcome music of the pawls as the anchor was dragged\r\nfrom the mud and hauled, gray and dripping, to the catheads.\r\n\r\nInstantly the schooner took the feel of a live ship, to use Cardon's\r\nwords. She heeled ever so little, and, as he lay in the bunk, he could\r\nhear the warble of the water against her planking, to say nothing of\r\nthe rattle of the rudder chain and the occasional creak of woodwork\r\nacknowledging mast pressure and strain.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Cardon, tired with the stuffy air of the cabin, dropped\r\nasleep. When he awoke, Floyd was standing beside him, and by the\r\nmovement of the cabin he knew that the _Southern Cross_ had cleared the\r\nharbor and was making her bow to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\"How about the pilot?\" asked Cardon, rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Dropped him long ago,\" replied Floyd. \"Hop out and come on deck. The\r\nfellow is laying the things for breakfast, and a breath of air will do\r\nyou good.\"\r\n\r\nCardon slipped from the bunk and came on deck.\r\n\r\nA brave breeze was blowing, and the sea, roughed up beneath the\r\nmorning sun, had a hard, gemlike look. Foam caps showed, and in the\r\nwest the setting moon hung, ghostlike, in a sky that suggested millions\r\nand millions of miles of depth and blueness.\r\n\r\nAll the east was hard and bright; all the west was blue and subtle and\r\ntender; and between the east and the west lay the sea like a country\r\ncarved from sapphire and tourmaline, with the green hills of earth\r\nsinking slowly but surely away beyond the foam in the schooner's wake.\r\n\r\nThen, as the sun mounted higher, the sea lost its look of solidity,\r\ncast it back on the land, now remote and hard, black fish came\r\nwalloping along as if racing the rushing schooner. The wind,\r\nfreshening, blew in great, steady gusts, filling the bellying canvas\r\nand pressing like a great hand so that the lee rail was almost awash\r\nand the spray came inboard, fresh, like the very breath of the sea.\r\n\r\nCardon, with his hand on the ratlines, stood taking it all in while\r\nFloyd stood beside him, his clothes flapping round him in the flogging\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nMountain Joe was at the wheel. He showed no surprise at Cardon's\r\npresence on board, nor did any of the others. They evidently looked on\r\nhim as a passenger or supercargo of some sort approved of by Hakluyt.\r\n\r\n\"She's a good sea boat,\" said Cardon, \"and she seems to steer well; but\r\nwhat in the nation can have become of Luckman?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what's bothering me,\" said Floyd. \"I've been trying to figure\r\nthe thing out ever since we got the anchor on board. He can't be stowed\r\naway anywhere. He's not in the fo'c'sle, for I went down there under\r\nthe pretense of seeing whether the hammocks were all right. He's not\r\nin the galley, he's not in the cabins, and he's not in the hold. He's\r\nnot on board, in fact. Well, what is the meaning of it? The only thing\r\nI can imagine is that the affair has fallen through and he's gone off\r\nwith the money Hakluyt gave him--either that or I must have imagined\r\nthe conversation I heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I reckon that wasn't any imagination of yours,\" said Cardon.\r\n\"There was lots of reason why Hakluyt should have put the business\r\nagainst you. No; the only explanation is that the thing, as you say,\r\nmust have fallen through. Luckman funked it and took his hook with the\r\nmoney. That's the only possible thing that can have happened. But it\r\nleaves the position just the same as far as you and I are concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just this: The plot was made against you, and it wasn't made in\r\nSydney. It was all arranged on the island between Schumer and Hakluyt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it must have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, the question turns up, are you going to go on working with\r\nthis Schumer, who has made all the arrangements for doing you in and\r\nwho would have done you in had not the thing fallen through?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" said Floyd. \"I have finished with Schumer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, you haven't!\" replied Cardon. \"Not by a long chalk. There\r\nremains the question of the pearls, and the question of punishment.\r\nSchumer has got to pay for his villainy, and pay through the nose. But\r\nthere's the fellow bringing breakfast aft. Let's go down, and we can\r\ntalk the matter out below.\"\r\n\r\nThey went down, and when breakfast was over Cardon lit a pipe, settled\r\nhimself comfortably on the couch at the starboard side of the cabin,\r\nand, after a moment's silence, turned to Floyd, who was lighting a\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n\"You have got to get even with Schumer, and from all you have told\r\nme of Schumer you will have your work cut out. I know the type. The\r\nPacific is full of it. This chap is a trader and a sailor and a fighter\r\nall rolled in one. I know the sort--able to do anything, from playing a\r\ntune on a fiddle to playing a dirty trick. I know them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you be too sure,\" said Floyd. \"This man Schumer is not one of\r\nthe ordinary sort of traders and swindlers. He's a very big man. He\r\nought to have been anything, and the wonder to me is he has never risen\r\nto something in the world better than what he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you have his weakness,\" said Cardon. \"I admit he may be a big\r\nman, as you say; and yet, as you say, he is only a little one as far\r\nas the world is concerned. There's something wrong somewhere in his\r\nmake-up. He doesn't drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not he!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's some crack in him we must try and feel for. I expect\r\nthe chap is such a rightdown wrong one that he has failed in life just\r\nbecause of that. I don't say I'm not a failure in my way, but I have\r\nfailed mostly through taking things easy and trusting in men. But\r\nSchumer hasn't those weaknesses, if I can judge by what you have told\r\nme. No; I suspect his disease has been a pretty general one. He's a\r\nwrong un. I'm not a man given to moralizing, but I've seen a lot of\r\nthe world, and I've seen that men who don't run straight don't get on.\r\nIt's funny, but they don't. Now look at old man Schumer's case. He fell\r\nin with a pearl lagoon; he has taken twenty thousand pounds' worth of\r\npearls out of it, and maybe more by this. He had a partner named Floyd.\r\nHe couldn't run straight with that partner, but must lay plans for his\r\nwiping out. Floyd discovers his trick, and now Schumer is going to lose\r\npearls and lagoon and all; and when he's lost them he will go back to\r\nhis old way of life with his feathers clipped, and men will say: 'I\r\ncan't understand that Schumer; he ought to have been anything, and yet\r\nthere he is bumming around in bars.' That's what they will say. Honesty\r\nis the best policy, and that's God's truth and no copybook story, and\r\nthat's what I'm going to teach Schumer.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, look here, you say he is going to lose pearls and lagoon and\r\nall----\"\r\n\r\n\"I? He may keep the lagoon--we only want the pearls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what you are going to say--we have to get them before we keep\r\nthem. I know. The thing to worry out is how we are to get the weather\r\ngauge on him. You have taken me into this affair as a partner, offering\r\nme half your share. I don't want that. I want Schumer's share. The man\r\nis a murderer, and deserves hanging. I am only going to fire him, but I\r\nadmit the thing will be difficult.\r\n\r\n\"If we sail into the lagoon and declare war openly with him, he'll\r\nfight, and he'll be backed by all those natives he has got there.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will, and besides there's the--the girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so; you don't want her injured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cardon,\" said Floyd, \"I tell you the truth as between man and man.\r\nShe's everything. I don't care a straw about the pearls, about money,\r\nabout Schumer. I don't care about life itself where she's concerned.\r\nShe's the only thing I have ever cared for really.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" cut in Cardon, \"if you care for her like that, it's all\r\nthe more important for you not to be done out over the pearls. Pearls\r\nare money. Well, do you think you don't want money? To a single man,\r\nmoney is useful, but to a man with a woman in tow, by God, it's a blank\r\nnecessity! What are you to do with her as a sailor? Leave her in some\r\nseaport while you are off sweeping the sea for tuppence a week in some\r\ndirty hooker owned by some dirty owner who feeds his men on salt horse\r\nand sends them to the bottom through overloading or for the sake of the\r\ninsurance money? No. If you care for a woman, put a pistol to her head\r\nbefore you turn her into a sailor's wife, depending on a sailor's pay.\r\nYou have got to get the money that's owing to you from Schumer, and you\r\nhave got to get your satisfaction from him. I don't know how yet, but\r\nI'll find out by thinking over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Floyd. \"I have got to get the money, anyhow, even\r\nif I don't get the satisfaction. But there's another point: Suppose I\r\ndo get the pearls; there's always a difficulty in selling them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't worry about that,\" said Cardon. \"I've got the means of\r\nselling anything that is come by honestly. I have a good name among\r\na good set at 'Frisco. Now I'll tell you something you can't easily\r\nbelieve; but if I wanted to borrow money in 'Frisco, I could do so to\r\nthe extent of thousands and thousands of dollars. There are two men\r\nthere, rich men, who would let me draw on them for what I liked; and\r\nyet I have often borrowed a few dollars from a poor man--you remember\r\nthat five dollars I got from you and which I owe you still, by the way.\r\nNo, sir, I have never tapped those rich men because they are under\r\nan obligation to me, and because they are my friends, and because I\r\nknow that they would be only too pleased to lend to me. Men are funny\r\nthings, and I guess I'm a man. Anyhow, that's how things stand. Now,\r\nif I were to go to those men and say: 'Look here, I have got a fortune\r\nin pearls, and I want to turn it into dollars,' those fellows would\r\nput all their means at my disposal to get me the best price, and ten\r\nto one they'd buy the stuff themselves, and my difficulty would be\r\nto stop them from paying too big a price. One is Kane, of the Union\r\nPacific Company; the other is Calthorpe, the grain man. I knew them\r\nfirst twenty years ago, when we were all dead beats together. Kane\r\nstarted life as a newsboy, selling books on the cars of the Reading\r\nRailway. He builds them now. Calthorpe started in life on the docks at\r\n'Frisco, helping to load sacks of wheat. They don't load wheat in sacks\r\nnowadays; his elevators do most of the work. Well, they are white men,\r\nand though they have wives and daughters and carriages, they are always\r\nglad to see me at their offices, and they are such gentlemen they have\r\nnever offered to start me in life. They take me as one of themselves,\r\nand we have a clack and a smoke and a drink. I generally stand the\r\ndrinks, and I know they are green with envy of my stomach, for they\r\nare both eaten up with dyspepsia. Now those chaps have succeeded in\r\nlife, but they haven't succeeded in keeping up their pleasure in\r\nlife. I have, and I reckon, when all's said and done, the account is\r\non my side. They are pretty well done to death with worry, living in\r\nstuffed-up rooms, fighting every moment of the day to keep what they've\r\ngot, taking their food like medicine, and with gold teeth in their\r\nheads to help them chew it; and here am I with every tooth in my head\r\nand an appetite like a shark, clear two hundred, without an ache or\r\npain, breathing God's good air, and sailing to belt a chap over the\r\nhead and collar a pearl lagoon. I guess they'd change places if their\r\nwives would let them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have never grown old,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"I'm forty-five,\" replied Cardon, \"and I don't want to grow any older,\r\nand I wouldn't be an inch younger for worlds. A man only begins to live\r\nproperly when he's forty, and at forty-five he has just about found\r\nhimself. Well, I'm going on deck to have a breath of air. She seems to\r\nbe going a bit steadier; I expect the wind has fallen.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they got on deck, they found that the wind had lost its gusty\r\ncharacter and had settled down into a steady blow. The land was very\r\nfar away, and only one sail was in sight--a full-rigged ship, almost\r\nhull down on the horizon and white like a flake of spar. The _Southern\r\nCross_ was heading northeast, on a course that would leave Norfolk\r\nIsland some two hundred miles to port; and before her lay that great,\r\nempty zone of sea which stretches from the Kermadec Islands to the\r\nTongas, and from the Australs to the Isle of Pines.\r\n\r\nSome ten days out from Sydney, they hailed a steamer; she was the mail\r\nboat from Auckland to Fiji, and the last trace of her smoke was the\r\nlast sign of man for many days.\r\n\r\nThe weather was perfect and the wind favorable, though moderate, as\r\nthey stole northward toward the line. Each day the sea became of a\r\ndeeper and deeper blue, and each day the sense of remoteness from the\r\nworld as we know it grew more intense.\r\n\r\nThe nights were tremendous with stars, and the days were scarcely days,\r\nas days are reckoned with us. They left on the mind only one enduring\r\nimpression--great spaces of radiant blueness, infinite distance where\r\nthere was nothing but the send of the sea and the blowing of a tepid\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nOne day, breaking the sea line on the starboard bow, came an island--a\r\ndream of the sea, foam-stained and waving palms to the wind, the tepid\r\nwind still blowing steadily and ceaselessly like the moist, warm breath\r\nof million-leagued Capricorn. It was Rarotonga.\r\n\r\nIt faded away, and at sunset it had vanished. Next day, toward noon,\r\nthe Hervey Islands showed right ahead, and, like a white gull coming\r\nfrom the islands toward them, a schooner. She passed only a few cable\r\nlengths away, her canvas luminous and honey-colored with the sun. She\r\nwas a trader bound for the Tongas, and in an hour she was a speck to\r\nthe southward, while the Hervey Islands loomed more fully ahead, only\r\nto be passed with the sunset and wiped away utterly by the night.\r\n\r\nOne evening Floyd, who had been working out the reckoning, said to\r\nCardon:\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, if this wind holds good, we ought to arrive--somewhere\r\nabout noon, I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Cardon. \"And now I'll tell you of the plan that's been in\r\nmy head for the last couple of days. We have no longer to reckon with\r\nLuckman; he has evidently miscarried. Still, Schumer will give us all\r\nthe work we want. My plan is this, and it's simple enough. When we drop\r\nanchor, he's almost sure to come on board. Well, you must receive him\r\non deck and ask him down into the main cabin. I'll be ambushed in your\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n\"Out I'll step, put Joe's muzzle to his head, and say, 'Hands up!' When\r\nhe's disarmed, we'll give him a fair hearing and a fair trial; you'll\r\nbe judge, and I'll be jury. Then we'll lock him up in your cabin to\r\npray for his sins, and I'll keep watch on him while you go ashore and\r\ncollect the pearls and the girl.\r\n\r\n\"You'll bring them off, and then we'll put to sea. Outside the reef\r\nwe'll put Schumer in a boat and let him row ashore. Then we'll upstick\r\nback to Sydney, and there you and I will have an interview with\r\nHakluyt, fling Luckman and all that business in his teeth, and gag him\r\nwith it. Then we'll make for 'Frisco by the mail boat. You see, we must\r\ntake the schooner back to Sydney, or else be had, maybe, for stealing\r\nher. Well, what do you think of the plan?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said he, \"Schumer doesn't put his hands up when you tell\r\nhim. Suppose he goes for his revolver?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose he comes on board with half a dozen of those natives and\r\nbrings them armed? It's not likely, but Schumer is just the man to do\r\nan unlikely thing of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we see him coming off with a boatload of those scalawags, we must\r\nchange our plan. I can hide till we are able to get him onto the\r\nschooner alone; but there's no use supposing too much. What we want is\r\na plan to go on, and that's the best I can think of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Floyd, \"I don't like it, and that's the truth. It's a good\r\nenough plan, no doubt, but there seems to me something treacherous\r\nabout it. I don't mean that in a nasty way, or as reflecting on you.\r\nAll the same, it's a plan I'd hate to carry out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and who forces us to use treachery, as you call it? If you hide\r\nbehind a bush to shoot a tiger, is that treachery? No, it would be if\r\nyou were dealing with a man; it isn't if you are dealing with a tiger.\r\nSchumer is a tiger; or, more like, a polecat; and if you don't use\r\ntreachery, he will. He has already, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd still have the lagoon,\" said Floyd, wavering.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we'd leave him the lagoon--not for love, but for our own sakes.\r\nI've been figuring the thing out, and we'd better let the lagoon go. If\r\nwe tried to cling to it, we would have to tear Schumer's claws loose\r\nfrom it, not to speak of Hakluyt's. If we leave it to them, it will be\r\na sop in the pan and will stop them from making any worry. We only want\r\nthe pearls already captured. They'll do for us.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd heaved a sigh. He could not but see the force of Cardon's\r\nreasoning. Schumer deserved punishment, beyond all question; he had\r\nplotted with Hakluyt, and the plot had only failed to materialize owing\r\nto some accident or some rascality on the part of Luckman toward his\r\nfellow conspirators. Still, he hated the idea of the whole business.\r\nInveigling a man into the cabin and then clapping a pistol to his head\r\nwas a plan of action that would never have occurred to him. Cardon was\r\nthicker skinned. All the same, he could not help feeling that Cardon\r\nwas right.\r\n\r\nThere are some men whom it is impossible to deal with as gentlemen,\r\njust as there are some men whom it is impossible to fight with\r\naccording to the rules of the prize ring. Schumer was one of them.\r\n\r\nFloyd thought the matter over for a moment, and came to the conclusion\r\nthat Cardon was right. \"I have no right to criticize your plan,\" he\r\nanswered, \"since I haven't any plan of my own to offer instead of it.\r\nWe'll leave it at that, and trust to luck, and if it comes to doing\r\nwhat you say, I will, of course, back you, unless I hit on any idea\r\nbetween this and to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on deck. The _Southern Cross_, carrying every stitch of her\r\ncanvas, was making a good ten knots, and the foam in her wake had\r\na phosphorescence as though she were leaving behind her a cloud of\r\nluminous smoke that clung to the water and refused to rise. Never\r\nhad he seen the stars more wonderful, or a night more lovely. There\r\nwas little of the heaviness and languor of the tropics; and but for\r\nCanopus and the Cross blazing overhead it might have been a night of\r\nJune in northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nFloyd stood by the fellow at the wheel for a little while, and then he\r\nwalked forward, and, leaning against the lee rail, looked over the sea.\r\nFrom the fo'c'sle came the sound of a concertina, faint and indistinct;\r\nthat and the creak of cordage and the slashing of the bow wash were the\r\nonly sounds in all that infinity of night and silence.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of Isbel and the island invisible, but surely there\r\nbeyond the rim of the sea. There were moments when the whole thing\r\nseemed a fantastic dream--Schumer, and the pearls, and the island,\r\nand the woman he loved. Was it possible that he would see her on the\r\nmorrow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning early, Floyd was on deck and aloft with a glass. He knew\r\nit was impossible, at their rate of sailing, that the island could show\r\nup before noon. They might not even sight it before sundown. Yet, all\r\nthe same, he was on the lookout. There was nothing; nothing but the\r\ngreat wheel of the sea. Not even a gull showed in the whole of that\r\nblue expanse.\r\n\r\nHe came down, disappointed, and was gloomy and absent-minded at\r\nbreakfast, though Cardon was cheerful enough.\r\n\r\nToward eleven o'clock, when they were on deck smoking and talking, a\r\ngreat bird passed them, flying straight ahead.\r\n\r\n\"That chap is going twenty knots,\" said Cardon. \"I reckon he could make\r\nforty if he wanted to. He's not much of an indication that there's land\r\nabout, for a thousand miles to him is less than a thirty-mile walk to\r\nyou or me. Say, Floyd, how would it be if we couldn't find your island?\r\nI heard a yarn once of a chap who spotted a guano island. He said it\r\nwas a solid slab of guano a mile wide, and he started for 'Frisco and\r\ngot up a syndicate to work it, and they chartered a schooner and had a\r\nchampagne breakfast to start on; and when they reached the spot, the\r\ndarned thing had gone--sunk into the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish!\" said Floyd. \"And I wish you wouldn't start those sorts of\r\nyarns just now; it's not lucky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am only joking. Your island is there, safe enough, with Schumer\r\non top of it. That sort of chap never sinks into the sea; it's only the\r\ngood men Davy Jones troubles about. He's a mascot, sure.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd did not answer him; he was staring right ahead.\r\n\r\n\"When I sighted it first,\" said he, \"I was in an open boat that gave\r\nvery little horizon, and what struck me first was the sky. It was pale,\r\njust a patch of it, a sort of glittering paleness that was caused by\r\nthe lagoon. Have you ever seen that mark in the sky above a lagoon\r\nisland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say I have, but then I'm not so used to the Pacific as you are.\r\nDo you see anything now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Floyd. \"I wish I did.\"\r\n\r\nCardon whistled gently to himself, tapping the ashes out of his pipe\r\nagainst the rail and refilling it. He was just as anxious as Floyd, but\r\nhis anxiety had not such a keen edge and he hid it better. There were\r\ntimes when he, like Floyd, almost doubted the reality of the island.\r\n\r\nHe was bending in the shelter of the bulwark to light his pipe when a\r\nhail came from aloft.\r\n\r\nFloyd had stationed a lookout in the crosstrees, and it was his voice\r\nthat came, high and clear, like the call of a bird.\r\n\r\nNext moment the two men were swarming up the ratlines and looking\r\nforward in the direction to which the fellow was pointing.\r\n\r\n\"It's the island!\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nCardon looked.\r\n\r\nAll he could see at first was a tiny mark on the sea line, a mark no\r\nlarger than a pin head; then, as his eyes grew more accustomed to the\r\ndazzle, another tiny mark appeared close to the first, and then another.\r\n\r\nThen these marks became fused together, forming a faint line.\r\n\r\nThe lookout had a glass with him, and Floyd, taking it, found that it\r\ngave scarcely any better definition than the naked eye. The shimmer of\r\nthe sea formed a veil more impenetrable than the veil of distance.\r\n\r\nHe handed the glass to Cardon, who was clinging to the ratlines below\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"It's land, sure enough,\" said Cardon, \"and another hour will bring it\r\nright up. We'd better go down and wait on deck; no use sticking here.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour the palm tops showed clearly through the glass,\r\nand in two hours' time the reef could be made out and the white thread\r\nof the foam breaking upon it.\r\n\r\nIt was the island, surely enough, though still a great way off--so far\r\nthat from the deck and with the naked eye nothing could be seen but a\r\nfaint smudge that might have been a trace of smoke clinging to the sea\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe wind had fallen a bit, and now, as if beneath the weight of\r\nafternoon, it was falling still more.\r\n\r\nFloyd hove the log. They were making seven knots, and he calculated\r\nthat it would be sundown before they could make the break in the reef.\r\n\r\nDinner was served, but they could scarcely eat; the weather held all\r\ntheir thoughts, and the dread of the wind falling to a flat calm was on\r\nboth their minds.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock, however, the wind was still steady, and the land ahead\r\nwas visible now clearly from the deck.\r\n\r\nFloyd, who had gone aloft, suddenly hailed Cardon, who was on deck, and\r\nthe latter came up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Look out and tell me what you see,\" said Floyd, handing him the glass\r\nhe had been using.\r\n\r\nCardon looked through the glass.\r\n\r\n\"By gad,\" said he, \"there's a vessel in the lagoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe glass showed the reef and the grove on the right of the break\r\ndistinctly. The break in the reef was not so clear, as they were\r\nheading slightly to the south of it; but very clearly indeed could be\r\nseen the threadlike masts of a vessel anchored in the lagoon. She was\r\nstripped of canvas. She was a schooner.\r\n\r\nCardon handed the glass up again to Floyd, who took another long look;\r\nthen the two men came down on deck.\r\n\r\n\"That's Luckman!\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"'Pears so,\" said Cardon, \"unless it's some vessel blown in by chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's no chance. I feel convinced of that. He started ahead of us,\r\nand maybe laid over us in sailing. Let's go down below and have a talk\r\nover this.\"\r\n\r\nThey went down to the cabin, and Floyd took his seat at the table while\r\nCardon took the couch.\r\n\r\n\"You see, it explains everything,\" said Floyd. \"Explains why Luckman\r\ndid not sail with us, and why Hakluyt looked so cheerful, which he\r\nwouldn't have done had his plans fallen through.\"\r\n\r\n\"If what you say is right,\" said Cardon, \"it makes everything a lot\r\nworse, for why should these scoundrels employ two ships unless they\r\nare determined to lose one of them? You may bet the _Southern Cross_\r\nis insured to the hilt and over. You say Hakluyt had her into dry dock\r\nand spent money having her scraped when she did not want it. That was\r\nall part of the plan to allay suspicion, for what would the ordinary\r\nfool say but that a man wouldn't spend money like that on a ship he was\r\ngoing to lose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said Floyd, \"if Hakluyt had sent Luckman with me, what\r\nreason could he have given me for sending him? We don't want another\r\nwhite man in this business--well, what excuse could Hakluyt have given\r\nme for shoving Luckman in?\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" said Cardon, \"that I can see; but that's not saying a clever\r\nrascal like Hakluyt couldn't have found some excuse.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd suddenly struck the table with his fist.\r\n\r\n\"The _Domain_ wasn't at her anchorage when we left,\" said he. \"I\r\nnoticed it, but I never thought of it as being connected with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Domain_? What vessel was she?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of Hakluyt's, a schooner. She was pointed out to me as belonging\r\nto him, and before we started I noticed that she wasn't at her\r\nanchorage. I thought nothing of that, for a shipowner doesn't keep\r\nships to anchor them out and leave them to rot. But there's the fact,\r\nand I'll bet my life that schooner in the lagoon is the _Domain_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're probably right,\" said Cardon. \"Anyhow, we'll soon see. Now\r\nlet's talk of my share in the business. If Luckman is really here, it\r\nmeans that your destruction has been plotted and planned to the last\r\ntip end. It means that there must be no quarter for Schumer.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Luckman is here,\" said Floyd, rising and pacing the cabin, \"Schumer\r\nwill get no quarter from me. Not a ha'porth of mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you are beginning to see things in their proper light,\"\r\nsaid Cardon. \"And now to business. I must keep hidden; I can stay in\r\nyour cabin, and you must get these two fellows on board as quick as\r\npossible. It may be that Schumer will board us right away when we get\r\ninto the lagoon. He's almost sure to. It may be that he will bring\r\nLuckman with him. Now I think the best plan, if Schumer boards us right\r\noff and by himself, is to deal with him at once, lock him up here, and\r\nthen land and deal with Luckman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you are right,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I am. There's nothing like grasping your nettle right off,\r\nand it will give them no time to conspire together. Of course, if they\r\nboth come aboard, so much the better. You speak to them fair, and\r\nbring them down here, get them seated at the table before some drink;\r\nthen I'll open the cabin door and enter, smiling. Directly you see\r\nme, draw your gun and cover one of them. Cover Luckman; that will be\r\npleasanter for you, seeing that Schumer is known to you and was once\r\nyour friend--or pretended to be. When we have disarmed them, we will\r\ntie them up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they succeed in drawing their pistols?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case we must shoot first, and shoot to kill. There's no use\r\nin putting on kid gloves in this matter. Your life has been planned\r\nagainst; these two chaps are out against you, and they've got to be\r\nscotched. Do you feel equal to the job? If not, we had better 'bout\r\nship and make back to Sydney.\"\r\n\r\n\"God help me,\" said Floyd, \"but what I would have shuddered at a few\r\ndays ago leaves me now without the least feeling. It's finding Luckman\r\nhere, I suppose, finding that the plot against me is absolutely true. I\r\ndon't know. But the idea of killing those men seems no more to me than\r\nthe idea of killing a pair of scorpions.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said Cardon. \"You'll do all right. And now up with\r\nyou on deck--I don't appear till the business begins. If I were to go\r\non deck now, there's no knowing that I mightn't be spotted through a\r\nglass. Give me your fist.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men shook hands.\r\n\r\nThen Floyd went on deck, where the hands were crowded forward, gazing\r\nat the island, which was now so close that the individual trees could\r\nbe distinguished, the coral, and the surf breaking on the outer beach.\r\n\r\nFloyd's heart leaped in him at the sight. He took the glass from its\r\nsling near the wheel and examined the shore through it. Not a sign of\r\nlife could be seen.\r\n\r\nThe house was, of course, hidden by the grove, and it was quite\r\nunlikely that any one might be here on the seaward side of the reef;\r\nstill, the absence of all signs of life struck a chill to the heart of\r\nFloyd, the illogical heart of the man who loves.\r\n\r\nThe wind was still holding steady, and the _Southern Cross_ was making\r\ngood way.\r\n\r\nNow they were so close that he fancied he could hear the tune of the\r\nsurf on the coral; and now they were opening the break of the reef, and\r\nthe lagoon showed mirror calm as compared to the sea.\r\n\r\nFloyd took the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe schooner held for a moment on her course; then, answering to the\r\nhelm, made full for the opening in the reef. The tide was with them,\r\nand like a white cloud the _Southern Cross_ passed the pierheads of the\r\nreef and entered the lagoon.\r\n\r\nFloyd handed the wheel over to Mountain Joe, gave his orders to the\r\nfellows at the halyards and the braces, and walked forward. There was,\r\nindeed, another vessel in the lagoon, and she was the _Domain_. He\r\ncould not be mistaken. She was anchored a good way out from the shore,\r\nand he maneuvered to get the inner berth. Even as he did so, his eye\r\ncaught sight of a figure that had just emerged from the grove. It was\r\nIsbel.\r\n\r\nHe ran to the bulwark rail and flung up his arm just as the roar of the\r\nanchor chain through the hawse pipe cut the air. Isbel waved her hand\r\nin reply. She was alone. Not a sign of Schumer or Luckman was to be\r\nseen, and Floyd, half mad with delight, started orders for the quarter\r\nboat to be lowered, and helped with his own hands at the falls.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat touched the beach he sprang out knee-deep in the water,\r\nwaded ashore, and caught her two hands in his.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered the fellows in the boat and the possibility that\r\nSchumer might be watching from some post of observation. He released\r\nher hands and led the way up to the house.\r\n\r\n\"Schumer?\" said he. \"Where is Schumer?\"\r\n\r\nIsbel nodded toward the fishing camp.\r\n\r\n\"Over there,\" said she; \"he and the new man. They will only know that\r\nyou have come now. I saw you very far at sea, but I said nothing. I\r\nwas to light a fire if I saw a ship, but I knew it was you, and I did\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\nThey had entered the house, and were safe from observation.\r\n\r\n\"Isbel,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nHe held her apart from him for a moment; then he caught her in his arms.\r\n\r\nShe clung to him, holding him about the neck with her naked arms,\r\ntelling him in a broken voice and a half whisper how she had waited\r\nand watched always for him; how she had prayed to the sea to bring him\r\nback, and the stars to light him on his way. Then holding him from her\r\nshe told, in short, hot sentences, fierce as stabbing spears, of his\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nA new ship had come into the lagoon only the day before; a new man had\r\njoined Schumer, a terrible man. They had talked last night, and she\r\nhad listened. No sooner had this strange man shown his face than she\r\nsuspected danger; he \"carried danger with him.\" So she had listened.\r\nThey had not talked in the house; they had gone together and sat by the\r\ngrove edge. She had crawled through the trees and listened. At first\r\nshe could not make out what they said, they spoke in so low a tone;\r\nthen, feeling safe and forgetting caution, they spoke louder. Even\r\nstill she could seize upon nothing definite, as they spoke in a general\r\nway as if about some prearranged plot, but she gathered enough to know\r\nthat Luckman had come to the island to wait for the man she loved,\r\nand then, with the help of Schumer, or, more properly speaking, the\r\nconnivance of Schumer, to do away with him.\r\n\r\nAs she told this her gaze seemed to turn inward, as though she were\r\nlooking at some mental picture, and a long shudder ran through her as\r\nthough from some vibration of the soul. It was not the shudder of fear\r\nor cold; it was the shudder of hate, and Floyd, who had never seen it\r\nbefore, felt for a moment almost afraid of Isbel. He recognized, and\r\nnot for the first time, that this being whom he loved belonged to a\r\nworld of which he knew little. She was a person from another star, the\r\nchild of another race. In her love for him a whole unknown world was\r\nrushing to meet him. It was this that completed her fascination and\r\nmade him, now heedless of Schumer's menace, seize her to his heart and\r\ncover her face and throat with burning kisses. Taking fire she returned\r\nthem, and then, holding him apart from her again, and still speaking in\r\nthose sentences, short and hot like stabbing spears that have already\r\ntasted blood, she went on to give him all that she had gathered and\r\nall that she suspected. She knew for certain that Luckman and Schumer\r\nwere expecting Floyd, for they had mentioned him by name, and she knew\r\nfor certain that they had designs upon the life of the man they were\r\nexpecting, and here lay her great grief; she could not fathom the\r\nnature of their design. She had, however, gathered enough to understand\r\nthat the Kanaka crew of the _Southern Cross_ was to be brought ashore\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Floyd, \"they are going to do away with the schooner.\r\nWell, we will see. We will see which of us is the cuter and which the\r\nstronger. Isbel, I am not alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Isbel, looking at him with wide-open eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I have a friend with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"A friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a friend. Providence sent him, I think.\" He began to tell her\r\nabout Cardon, how he had met him in the street in Sydney, how Cardon\r\nhad joined in the venture and was ready to assist against Schumer, and\r\nhow he was now on board the _Southern Cross_ awaiting developments.\r\n\r\nHe had reached this stage in his story when a sound from outside made\r\nthem both turn. It was the sound of oars in rowlocks.\r\n\r\nFloyd sprang to the door. A boat that had crossed the lagoon from the\r\nfishing ground was within a few yards of the beach. It was the boat\r\nbringing Schumer from the fishing camp.\r\n\r\nA man was seated beside Schumer in the stern sheets. Was it Luckman?\r\n\r\nIf indeed it was Luckman, then Luckman was a most formidable\r\nindividual. This person seated beside Schumer was immense, a great\r\nfour-square built man beside whom Schumer had the appearance of a youth.\r\n\r\nAs the boat touched the sand Schumer leaped out, and, half wading, made\r\nup the beach toward Floyd, who had come down from the house. Isbel had\r\nremained indoors.\r\n\r\n\"So you're back,\" cried Schumer, as he held out his hand. \"I knew\r\nnothing till half an hour ago over there at the fishing ground I\r\nturned my head and saw the _Southern Cross_ coming into the lagoon.\r\nIsbel should have spotted her hours ago and given us a signal. Oh,\r\nI forgot. I have a new man to introduce you to, but you've seen his\r\nvessel; it ran in here yesterday for water. It is the _Domain_, of\r\nSydney, owned by--who do you think?--Hakluyt, and here's her captain;\r\nLuckman is his name. Luckman, this is Mr. Floyd.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Floyd held out his hand toward Luckman a curious sensation\r\nstruck him, as though for a moment he were clairvoyant, as though for\r\nthe hundredth part of a moment some glimpse had been given him of his\r\npsychic surroundings, a glimpse of the soul of Schumer, of Luckman, and\r\nincidentally of Hakluyt. It was Luckman's appearance, perhaps, that\r\ninfluenced him.\r\n\r\nLuckman, though a very big man at a distance, was a very little man\r\nseen close to. In other words, he had nothing to recommend him but his\r\nsize. He had, no doubt, been all that the barkeeper had hinted. He had,\r\nno doubt, sunk ships in his time and lost the lives of innumerable\r\nsailormen and escaped from the law himself by a miracle. All the same,\r\nfrom the crown of his flat head to the sole of his flat feet, the man\r\nwas a duffer, a mass of brute force--nothing more. And the thing that\r\nstruck Floyd most keenly at that moment was the thought that Luckman,\r\nlike himself, was in the toils of Schumer and Hakluyt; that Luckman\r\nmight be used as a tool against him--Floyd--but would be inevitably\r\nflung away when used by Schumer and Hakluyt. That they would take the\r\nopportunity not only of getting rid of the _Southern Cross_ at a high\r\ninsurance and of their troublesome partner, but also of Luckman, their\r\ntool and assistant.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Schumer had taken Luckman to the fishing ground and let\r\nhim see the secret of the island with his own eyes, that fact seemed to\r\nFloyd to be Luckman's death sentence.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to meet you,\" said Luckman, holding out a fist like a ham.\r\n\r\n\"It's funny that you should have turned up here,\" said Floyd, \"for only\r\na very little time ago I parted with Mr. Hakluyt, your owner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Luckman, \"it's funny enough to see two of Hakluyt's vessels\r\nin the same lagoon, considering the many lagoons there are in the\r\nPacific. I was bound for Upolo, and was blown a bit out of my course,\r\nthen I picked up this island and put in for water, and when Mr. Schumer\r\nhere found Hakluyt was my owner he _was_ surprised--weren't you, Mr.\r\nSchumer?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed as he asked the question, and Schumer laughed as he replied\r\nin the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"The strange thing is,\" said Floyd gravely, \"that I left Sydney, came\r\nstraight down here, and here I find the _Domain_, who has missed Upolo,\r\nwhich is a good way out of the line, been blown out of her course, and\r\nyet has arrived here only a day before me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how is that strange?\" asked Luckman.\r\n\r\n\"In this way: I saw the _Domain_ in Sydney harbor two days before I\r\nleft, riding at her anchor. How the deuce has she managed to go through\r\nall those experiences you speak of and yet arrive here only the day\r\nbefore me?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what date was it when you left Sydney?\" asked Luckman.\r\n\r\nFloyd gave the date.\r\n\r\n\"Well, all I can say,\" said Luckman, \"is that the _Domain_ left ten\r\ndays before that. You must be thinking of the _Dominion_, which is also\r\nowned by Hakluyt. She's a sister of the _Domain_, built on the same\r\nslip, owned by Shuster, she was, till he went bankrupt and Hakluyt\r\npicked her up for an old song. That's the vessel that's in your head.\r\nI left her anchored in Sydney harbor when I left.\" Floyd said nothing.\r\nLuckman's manner was so assured and plausible that had he not overheard\r\nthat fatal conversation in Hakluyt's office he would have been entirely\r\ntaken in. He turned to Schumer as if to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"how has the luck been going?\"\r\n\r\nSchumer took him by the arm and led him away a bit along the water edge.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you are back,\" said he, \"before that man Luckman leaves.\r\nIt's a nuisance, his coming. Of course he's one of Hakluyt's men, else\r\nI'd have made him clear out of the lagoon when he'd taken his water on\r\nboard. As it is he knows all about the pearling. He scented it at once,\r\nand spoke to me of it. You see, he's an old island hand, so I just told\r\nhim, and, what's more, took him right over the grounds. I did a bit of\r\ntrade with him, too. He had some timber and corrugated iron on board,\r\nand I bought it of him, and we've been rafting it over all yesterday\r\nand to-day. I'm going to put up huts over at the fishing camp. The\r\nrains will be here soon, now, and I want to get the fellows under\r\ncover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is that so?\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nHe could not make out all this in the least, but he determined to say\r\nnothing and wait for more indications.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Schumer, \"it's most important for us to keep these fellows\r\nfit and well, and tents aren't much use against the rains, especially\r\nin an exposed place like the grounds over there. Seems like Providence,\r\ndoesn't it, that fellow Luckman happening along with his building\r\nmaterial just at the moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Schumer,\" said Floyd, \"are you sure it's all right about Luckman?\"\r\n\r\nSchumer turned on him with a surprised look. \"Why, what could be wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I could have sworn I saw the _Domain_ in the harbor two days\r\nbefore I left.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Sydney harbor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in Sydney harbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear chap,\" said Schumer, \"you heard what he said--what could be\r\nwrong? Even if Hakluyt were to try to get the better of us in any way\r\nwhat could Luckman do? Steal the pearls? Well, I reckon he'd have\r\nhis work cut out, considering we are two to one. No. You have made a\r\nmistake. It was the _Dominion_ you saw. Mind you, I wouldn't trust\r\nHakluyt farther than I could see him, but it's against common sense to\r\nthink that he is trying to play any game against us. You see, the crew\r\nof the _Domain_ are all Kanakas, and not fighting Kanakas, either, but\r\na soft lot; otherwise it might be different. Then again Luckman is off\r\nto-morrow. Oh, you needn't be a bit scared of Luckman; I'm sharp enough\r\nto smell a rat, as you very well know, and I'm satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"Now as to the building business,\" went on Schumer, \"I want all the\r\n_Southern Cross_ chaps to get to work on it first thing to-morrow, so\r\nwe may as well get them over to the fishing camp to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they'll be able to stretch their legs before setting to, and\r\nthey'll want to put up tents for themselves while they are working.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. I can send them over in the whaleboat.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do after supper,\" said Schumer.\r\n\r\nThe sun at this moment was just setting beyond the reef, and a thin\r\nwreath of smoke was rising near the grove where Isbel was busy lighting\r\nthe fire and getting supper ready. Luckman was seated on the sand, near\r\nthe house, smoking and seemingly oblivious to everything but the beauty\r\nof the scene before him.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Southern Cross_ were fraternizing across the water\r\nwith the crew of the _Domain_. Their thin, high-pitched voices came\r\nacross the lagoon water and mixed with the crying of the gulls who\r\nwere flocking around the vessels, picking up scraps from the rubbish\r\nthat the fellows had hove overboard. Then, as the sun sank, the crying\r\nof the gulls died down and silence fell on the island with the night,\r\na silence only broken by the song of the surf and the blowing of the\r\nnight wind in the foliage of the grove.\r\n\r\nIsbel, having prepared the meal, had disappeared, and the three men\r\nfound themselves alone by the flickering camp fire. It was the night\r\nbefore the new moon, and beyond the zone of firelight the lagoon showed\r\nall shot with stars, and the two schooners gray black with their\r\nanchor lights shining in the twilight of the stars.\r\n\r\nSchumer had produced a bottle of wine in honor of Luckman, but despite\r\nthe wine and Schumer's attempts at conviviality the talk hung fire.\r\n\r\nFloyd was thinking hard.\r\n\r\nSchumer's suggestion that the crew of the _Southern Cross_ should be\r\nlanded over at the fishing beach was plausible on the face of it. The\r\nmen would work better after a night on shore; they would be on the spot\r\nin the morning, and so no time would be wasted bringing them across the\r\nlagoon, and it was certainly necessary that no time should be lost in\r\nputting up the huts, if they were to be put up, for the rainy season\r\nwas fast approaching. All the same, he felt that there was more in the\r\nproposition than what met the eye.\r\n\r\nHe did not like the idea of being left alone here with Schumer and\r\nLuckman. It was true that the crew of the _Domain_ would be on board\r\ntheir vessel, but she was anchored a good way out. The conviction came\r\nto him that whatever these two men had in mind was to be carried out\r\nthat night, and that the _Southern Cross_ would be the object of their\r\nplans as well as himself. Most possibly they would sink her at her\r\nanchorage after having disposed of him.\r\n\r\nHe determined, come what might, not to sleep ashore, and as they were\r\nfinishing supper he made up his mind to state his intention at once.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I suppose I'd better get off and send those fellows\r\nacross to the camp. I'll give them the whaleboat; it will hold the lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Schumer, \"I'll come with you and start them off, and maybe\r\nyou'd better sleep on board for to-night, as I've put Captain Luckman\r\nup in the house and there's only two beds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll sleep aboard,\" said Floyd, relieved, yet somewhat surprised\r\nat Schumer suggesting the very plan that was in his mind. \"I've got all\r\nmy tackle there, besides--well, shall we start?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked round, on the chance of seeing Isbel, but she was nowhere\r\nabout; then they left Luckman, smoking by the fire, and, going down to\r\nthe lagoon edge, pushed off the quarter boat which was lying by the\r\ndinghy. They would have taken the dinghy, only that she had developed\r\na leak. Schumer explained this as they rowed, and Floyd scarcely heard\r\nhim; he was thinking of Isbel.\r\n\r\nHe could not possibly take her off with him, and she was safer ashore\r\nin the dangerous business that he felt was developing. He had no fear\r\nof harm coming to her left alone with Schumer and Luckman, for she was\r\nwell able to take care of herself, and she was armed. She had told him\r\nso. All the same his heart felt heavy as lead at leaving her, even\r\nthough they were separated only by a couple of cable lengths of water.\r\n\r\nOn board, he gave orders to Mountain Joe for the landing of the crew,\r\nand in a moment the deck was swarming. The idea of getting ashore set\r\nthe fellows chattering and carrying on like school children just set\r\nfree, and there were no hands wanted to assist at the falls.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the whaleboat was lowered and alongside and the crew\r\ntumbling into her. Schumer helped in the lowering of the boat and\r\nshouted directions to Mountain Joe, who took the stern oar.\r\n\r\n\"They'll find canvas enough over there if they want to make tents,\"\r\nsaid Schumer. \"As like as not they will prefer sleeping in the open on\r\na night like this. There they go.\"\r\n\r\nThe whaleboat had pushed off, and was now out in the lagoon, making\r\ngood way despite its heavy load.\r\n\r\nIt looked like a huge, heavy-bodied beetle crawling across the surface\r\nof the lagoon.\r\n\r\nSchumer turned away and followed Floyd down to the cabin for a drink.\r\nFloyd had shipped some Bitter Water at Sydney, and he opened a bottle\r\nnow and produced glasses from the swinging rack by the door. He also\r\nbrought out a box of cigars.\r\n\r\nSchumer took a cigar and a drink, and sat down at the table, placing\r\nhis hat upon it.\r\n\r\nFloyd took his place opposite to him, and they sat smoking and talking\r\non indifferent matters, Floyd trying to keep pace with the situation\r\nand at the same time to appear his ordinary self.\r\n\r\nShould he deal with Schumer now and at once or let him go ashore and\r\nthen have a consultation with Cardon?\r\n\r\nCardon, he knew, was listening to every word of their conversation, and\r\nhe had a great respect for Cardon's judgment. He determined to explain\r\nthe situation to Cardon now and at once and through his conversation\r\nwith Schumer.\r\n\r\n\"It was a good idea of yours to send all the crew ashore at the fishing\r\ncamp so as to have them on the spot for working in the morning,\" said\r\nhe. \"Of course that only leaves me on board, and I'm a jolly sight too\r\ntired to stand an anchor watch. However, we don't want an anchor watch\r\nin this lagoon. There's nothing to look out for but sharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" replied Schumer.\r\n\r\n\"Luckman is off to-morrow, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he'll be off to-morrow if this wind holds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm glad to have met him. He didn't give me a very good\r\nimpression at first sight, but he improves a bit on acquaintance. He\r\nmust be a powerfully strong man. I'd sooner have him at my back in a\r\nfight than against me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Schumer, \"I reckon he could hold his own against any two\r\nmen, or maybe three, but he's all strength, not much intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's the intelligence that counts nowadays,\" said Floyd. \"You see,\r\nif a man has a gun and some intelligence, brute force doesn't count for\r\nmuch, or even numbers. I had an adventure once that proved that to me.\r\nI was held up in the cabin of a ship by two ruffians--it was off the\r\nSouth American coast--and I didn't resist simply for the reason that\r\na friend of mine was close by whom I reckoned to be a much cleverer\r\nchap than myself. He was lying in his bunk, and the fellows couldn't\r\nsee him. I waited for his lead. His name was Cardon, and I determined\r\nto let him decide whether I should put up a fight at once or just sit\r\nstill and let myself be robbed. It was the funniest sensation, sitting\r\nthere and waiting for another man's brains to work out the situation,\r\nbut I was right. The upshot was I recovered my money.\" He yawned, and\r\nthen suddenly, switching off the subject: \"There's no fear, is there,\r\nof Luckman getting too close to the pearls? Mind you, I'm not going\r\nagainst your judgment about the man. All the same, temptation is\r\ntemptation, and it's as well to be on our guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pearls are all right,\" said Schumer. \"They are in the safe, and\r\nthe safe is in the inner room of the house, and I sleep there.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose to go, flicking the ash of his cigar onto the floor. Floyd rose\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign from Cardon, so he knew that wily person had decided\r\nto let Schumer go ashore. Then he accompanied the other on deck.\r\n\r\nThe boat in which Schumer had come was alongside. He got into it, bade\r\nFloyd good night, and rowed ashore. Floyd watched him land. He saw\r\nLuckman come down from the house to help in beaching the boat, and\r\nthen the two men walked up to the house. They entered it, and closed\r\nthe door, and then beach and reef and grove lay deserted under the\r\nstarlight.\r\n\r\nFloyd left the deck and came down to the cabin, and there, at the\r\ntable, Cardon was seated.\r\n\r\n\"You've done well,\" said Cardon. \"I was afraid you would open the game\r\ntoo soon. Sit down there and give me a few points. What's Luckman like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a beast,\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"I heard all you said,\" went on Cardon. \"Schumer has got all the men\r\noff the ship, hasn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's their first move, and they mean business to-night--when you are\r\nsleeping. They won't act for an hour or two yet, so we have plenty of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's their game, do you think?\" asked Floyd.\r\n\r\n\"It's as simple as sin. They mean to row off, steal down here, knock\r\nyou on the head, and then scuttle the schooner. They'll reckon to take\r\nyou sleeping. That's their game, and as like as not, when the business\r\nis done, Schumer will do Luckman in and sink him with the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" said Floyd. \"I was thinking that myself to-night, and yet\r\nyou who have never seen Schumer suspected it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply because I have studied out the whole proposition while I was\r\nlying in that stuffy bunk. Can't you see how it stands? They must get\r\nrid of Luckman. The only thing that gravels me is this: Why did they\r\never bring Luckman into the affair at all? Why didn't Schumer knock you\r\non the head, do the thing off his own bat, so to speak?\r\n\r\n\"I can only work it out like this: If he had done that there would\r\nhave been witnesses sure. The crew of the _Southern Cross_ would have\r\nsmelled a rat. There's nothing more likely to pop out than murder if\r\nthere are any witnesses that know the murdered party. Schumer wants to\r\nbreak off from the island and every one connected with the pearling.\r\nMost likely he suspects the lagoon is beginning to give out. Anyhow, he\r\nhas got a big lot of stuff, and it's my belief that his plan is to cut\r\nhis stick instantly you are out of the way, leave the island and the\r\nlagoon and the niggers to look after themselves, and set sail in the\r\n_Domain_ with the boodle he's got. That's why he has landed the crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say he will desert the island and never come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely if he did a thing like that it would only mean losing a\r\ngood property. I don't believe the lagoon is giving out. There was no\r\nindication of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only suggested that. It may be giving out or it mayn't, but there's\r\nthis fact, you must admit--the lagoon is not real estate; you have no\r\ntitle to it. Suppose an English man-of-war shoves her nose in and asks\r\nyou what you are doing here. What will you say? That you are looking\r\nfor mushrooms? English, French, or German, the first ship that gets\r\nwind of the business does for you. They'll mark it down on their chart\r\nand say to you: 'This is our island; get out!' Suppose even a trader\r\ncomes along and sniffs you. Do you think they're going to leave a\r\njeweler's shop like this severely alone? Do you think they won't say\r\n'half shares or we split'? No, sir. You and Schumer have had a very\r\ngood swig at this cornucopia. It's amazing you haven't been interfered\r\nwith before this. The common-sense thing is to take what you've got and\r\ndo a bunk, cut all connections with the business, and don't leave a rag\r\nof yourselves behind. That's what Schumer is going to do. Of course\r\nhe'll have to play fair with Hakluyt so as to get rid of the pearls and\r\nhave no trouble about the schooner. Then there's the insurance money on\r\nthe _Southern Cross_. That will be a nice penny for them to divide.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are right,\" said Floyd. \"It's hateful--the whole thing.\r\nThe world seems suddenly to be filled with devils, not men. I could\r\nnever have fancied such villainy if I hadn't gone through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you'll be pretty tough to this sort of thing when you are as\r\nold as I am,\" said Cardon, \"and when you have knocked about the west\r\nAmerican seaboard a dozen years or so. You don't know these chaps as\r\nI do. A sailor doesn't know anything. You must leave the sea and stick\r\nfor a few years to the land as I have done to find the truth, and the\r\ntruth about the Pacific coast is that quite a lot of people don't give\r\na cent for the life of a man if it's worth a dollar to them.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there's no use in sticking down here any longer. We'd better be\r\ngetting up on deck and taking our position. I've got a plan in my head\r\nwhich you'll see put in work before long. Have you got your gun?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd showed the butt of his revolver.\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" said Cardon. \"And now, first of all, let's make everything\r\nstraight.\"\r\n\r\nThere were three glasses on the table, his own, Floyd's, and the one\r\nSchumer had drunk from. He renewed his own glass, looked round to make\r\nsure that he had left no trace of his presence anywhere, put out the\r\nlight, and led the way on deck.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the companionway he turned to Floyd, who was below him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't show yourself above the bulwarks,\" said he. \"Crawl along the\r\ndeck after me to the caboose. That's the place for us to hide and wait\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" said Floyd.\r\n\r\nThey crawled along on hands and knees till they reached the caboose\r\ndoor. It opened to the starboard, and as the _Southern Cross_ was\r\nswinging to the incoming tide, with her nose to the break in the reef,\r\nthe door of the caboose faced the _Domain_, and consequently could not\r\nbe seen from the shore.\r\n\r\nCardon opened the door, and they went in, closing the door behind them.\r\n\r\nThe place was terribly stuffy and filled with the smell of grease and\r\ncooking. The copper was still hot, which did not improve matters, and\r\ncockroaches were in evidence even in that darkness.\r\n\r\nThere was a scuttle giving aft, and in a moment Floyd had opened it.\r\nIt gave a view of the whole of the deck aft, and though there was no\r\nmoon the starlight showed everything. The main hatch, with its cover\r\nof tarpaulin, the saloon hatch, the bulwarks, and the planking of the\r\ndeck so clearly that the lines of division between the planks could be\r\ntraced, and even the dowels that fixed the planking to the beams.\r\n\r\nIt was a noisome hole to be cooped up in, but it was a splendid post of\r\nobservation, though, from the size of the scuttle, only one man could\r\nkeep a lookout at a time.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take it turn about,\" said Cardon, \"and the chap that's off duty\r\ncan sit on the copper and keep it warm. We haven't a watch, and a watch\r\nwould be no use to us, as we daren't show a light; so we'll have to\r\nguess the length of the trick. Ten minutes each will be the length of\r\nthe lookout as far as we can make it. I'll take first, if you don't\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\nFloyd had no objection, and he sat on a ledge by the copper, listening\r\nand waiting in the dark while Cardon stood on watch. The ship was full\r\nof sounds. On deck everything seemed bathed in dead silence, but here,\r\nlistening in the dark, all sorts of little noises came to greet the ear\r\nand imagination.\r\n\r\nThe outside sea sent a vague, almost imperceptible, swell into the\r\nlagoon, and as she moved to it she creaked and muttered and groaned,\r\nmasts, spars, and body timber all finding points of greater and lesser\r\ntension and every point a tiny voice.\r\n\r\nThe rudder shifted now and then slightly, and the rudder chain clicked\r\nin response. There were rats on board, and they made themselves\r\naudible, and there was a nest of young rats somewhere under the\r\nplanking, and their thriddy voices came in little bursts now and then,\r\ntelling of some disturbance in the nest. Floyd pictured to himself\r\nthe old mother rat suckling them while the father was out on business\r\nseeking food, and he philosophized on the idea that even the timbers of\r\na ship may hide all sorts of interests and ambitions, affections and\r\nhates.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, during which he and Cardon relieved each other at the\r\nlookout post several times, and it was during Cardon's watch, some\r\ntwenty minutes later, that the event occurred.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a sound made itself heard that was not a sound born of the\r\nship. A faint splash came from alongside, followed by something quite\r\nunmistakable--the sound of an oar shipped and laid along the seats of a\r\nboat--incautiously. It had probably slipped from the hand of the rower\r\nas he laid it inboard.\r\n\r\nFloyd, who had heard the sound also, tipped Cardon's leg with his toe,\r\nand Cardon, reaching out with his heel, signaled that he knew.\r\n\r\nA few seconds passed, and then Cardon saw a form coming over the side.\r\nIt was Schumer. He had never seen Schumer, but from Floyd's description\r\nhe knew that it could not be Luckman. Then, surely enough, came Luckman\r\nin all his immensity.\r\n\r\nNeither man wore either boots or stockings, and their bare feet, wet\r\nwith the bilge water of the boat, shone in the starlight. Those\r\nglistening feet fascinated Cardon. All the tragedy of the business\r\nseemed focused in them, and, strong and brave though he was, they\r\nexercised such a powerful psychological effect that for a moment he\r\ncould have retched.\r\n\r\nThe two men did not pause for more than a second. Soundless as shadows,\r\nthey made for the saloon hatch, while Cardon, who thought the moment\r\nfor action had arrived, moved slightly as if to leave his post.\r\n\r\nThen he stopped.\r\n\r\nSchumer and his companion, instead of going down below, were bending\r\nover the hatch. They were closing it.\r\n\r\nCardon drew in his breath.\r\n\r\nHe saw at once their object. Instead of going down to kill the man\r\nthey imagined to be below, they were bottling him up. No man, however\r\nstrong, could force his way on deck through that hatch once closed.\r\n\r\nAgain he felt Floyd's toe, as if it were inquiring if all was right,\r\nand, again reaching back, he signaled an answer. His eyes were glued to\r\nthe malefactors, who were now at the main hatch removing the tarpaulin.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long. Then they worked the locking bars loose and\r\nremoved the hatch with scarcely a sound. He saw Schumer produce\r\nsomething. It was a lantern. They lit it, and Schumer, with it in his\r\nhand, vanished down the main hatch into the hold. He was there a full\r\nminute that seemed a full hour to the man at the scuttle; then he\r\nreappeared. The hatch was closed, but the tarpaulin was not replaced,\r\nand, leaving it, they came forward, Schumer carrying the light and\r\nLuckman following him. They passed the caboose, and were lost to sight.\r\n\r\n\"Now is our time,\" whispered Cardon, turning from the scuttle. \"We've\r\ngot them forward in a close space. Cock your gun and follow me.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the caboose door and found a vacant deck.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he thought that the two men had gone overboard; then he\r\nsaw the truth. They had gone down into the fo'c'sle. Floyd saw the\r\nsituation and the chance in the same flash with Cardon, and in a moment\r\nthey had flung themselves on the fo'c'sle hatch cover and driven it to.\r\n\r\nThe men who fancied they had bottled Floyd were bottled in their turn.\r\n\r\nThey had imagined a vain thing, and the fact was evidently borne in on\r\nthem now to judge from the sounds coming from below.\r\n\r\nThe cover of the fo'c'sle hatch was placed at such an angle with the\r\nfo'c'sle companionway that it was impossible to make much noise by\r\nstriking upward from below, and its thickness was well demonstrated by\r\nthe feebleness of the noise of the men who were now shouting at the top\r\nof their voices.\r\n\r\n\"They're fixed and done for,\" said Cardon, \"and I reckon Schumer will\r\nstart repenting in a minute that he sent the crew ashore. Come, we have\r\nno time to waste here.\"\r\n\r\nHe ran to the port rail, followed by Floyd.\r\n\r\nThe boat Schumer and Luckman had come in was alongside. Every plan they\r\nhad made and every preparation seemed working now for their destruction\r\nand for the success of their enemies. The thought crossed Floyd's mind\r\nas he followed Cardon down into the boat, but there was little time to\r\nthink in, and, taking the stern oar while Cardon took the bow, they\r\npushed off for the shore.\r\n\r\nHaving beached the boat, Floyd led the way up to the house, and as they\r\napproached it a figure came out of the grove into the starlight. It was\r\nIsbel. Floyd ran up to her as Cardon entered the house; then, as he was\r\nholding her hands and trying to tell her all that had occurred, Cardon\r\nappeared at the house door with a lighted match in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"There's no safe here,\" said he.\r\n\r\nHe lit another match as they followed through the main into the inner\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing there at all, except the bed which Schumer slept on\r\nand the tossed blankets. The safe, which had stood in one corner of the\r\nroom, was gone.\r\n\r\n\"That does us,\" said Floyd. He had fancied that the pearls were a\r\nsecondary consideration, that Isbel was the one and only thing. Now\r\nhe knew different. Isbel was not the only thing. Without the pearls\r\nand the money they would fetch he was nothing. Nothing but a sailorman\r\nearning a few shillings a week, tossed hither and thither about the\r\nworld at the will of an owner.\r\n\r\nFor one terrible minute before the loss of these things he felt his\r\npoverty, and there is nothing much more terrible than that if one\r\nloves. What had stricken him would strike Isbel. Where could he take\r\nher? What could he do with her, he who had no home but a sailors'\r\nlodging home, no resources but a miserable pittance only to be earned\r\nat the cost of separation from her?\r\n\r\nCardon brought him back to himself.\r\n\r\n\"No, it doesn't,\" said Cardon, \"but it saves us a lot of trouble. Can't\r\nyou see? The pearls and the safe are on board the _Domain_?\"\r\n\r\n\"On board the _Domain_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where else? Didn't I tell you Schumer was going to shin out of here in\r\nthe _Domain_? Well, he has removed the safe there, and all we have to\r\ndo now is to go aboard the _Domain_, up anchor, and get away. He has\r\nplayed into our hands all through, and every point he made against us\r\nhas turned against him. Don't you see?\"\r\n\r\nFloyd did. This last act of Schumer's put the finishing touch to the\r\nbusiness. Not only had he saved them the trouble of carrying off\r\nthe safe, but he had destroyed all qualms in the mind of Floyd. All\r\nSchumer's plotting, so skillful, so carefully weighed, so intricate,\r\nand so powerfully backed by Hakluyt with his ships and money had been\r\nbrought to naught by one little flaw, one accident--Floyd's surprisal\r\nof Hakluyt's conversation with Luckman.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said Cardon.\r\n\r\nThey hurriedly left the house, Cardon walking first, Floyd following\r\nwith Isbel, whose hand he was holding.\r\n\r\nIt was their good-by to the island. In that short walk from the house\r\ndoor to the lagoon edge the fact that he was leaving what he nevermore\r\nmight see was brought vividly to the mind of Floyd. Never had the place\r\nseemed more beautiful from the piers of the reef to the far-off fires,\r\nwhere the pearl fishers were holding a revel beneath the palm trees\r\nwith the crew of the _Southern Cross_.\r\n\r\nAs they rowed across the lagoon, passing under the stern of the\r\n_Southern Cross_, they could hear the songs brought by the wind across\r\nthe water from the fishing camp. Not a sound came from the schooner,\r\nwhere the trapped men were no doubt fumbling in the fo'c'sle for some\r\nmeans of escape, and not a sound came from the _Domain_, where the\r\nwhole crew, anchor watch included, were fast asleep. As they came\r\nalongside the _Domain_, Cardon hailed her, and a fellow rousing on deck\r\ncame to the bulwark rail, rubbing his eyes. He cast a rope, and the\r\nboat was made fast.\r\n\r\nThen they came on board.\r\n\r\nThree men had been sleeping on deck, the bos'n and two of the hands,\r\nand when Cardon gave the order to rouse the crew and get the anchor up\r\njust for a moment it seemed there was going to be trouble. Then Isbel\r\nsaved the situation.\r\n\r\n\"It is by Luckman's orders,\" said she, speaking in the native. \"He is\r\nstaying here; the ship is to be taken where he wills,\" she finished,\r\npointing at Cardon. Had there been any resistance on the part of the\r\nbos'n or the crew Cardon would have promptly dealt with it, but there\r\nwas none. They were an unsuspicious lot. There had been no sign of\r\ndisturbance on shore, and whether the ship sail under Luckman or under\r\nCardon did not matter a button to them. Besides, it was due to sail.\r\nThe water was on board, and Luckman had told them to be ready to weigh\r\nanchor at any moment.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing steadily for the break in the reef, and now, had\r\nyou been ashore, you would have seen the mainsail of the _Domain_\r\nrising like a black wing under the stars to the creaking of blocks and\r\nslatting of canvas; then came the sound of the capstan pawls as the\r\nanchor chain was hove short, and Floyd's voice ordering the jib to be\r\ncast loose. The tide was near the turn, and it was just approaching the\r\nmoment of smooth water at the reef opening.\r\n\r\nFloyd, before starting to work the vessel, had run down to the cabin,\r\nwhere, sure enough, the safe was standing against the couch which ran\r\nalong the starboard side, and between it and the table.\r\n\r\nNot only was the safe on board, but Schumer had also brought off\r\nthe tin cash box holding what remained to them of the money of the\r\n_Cormorant_ and _Tonga_.\r\n\r\nHe had made a clean sweep, only to sweep it all into Floyd's pocket.\r\n\r\nFloyd was thinking this as he stood on deck now giving orders for the\r\nsecuring of the anchor which had left the water and was being hoisted,\r\ndripping, to the catheads, and now as the mainsail filled to the wind\r\nhe took the wheel himself.\r\n\r\nAs he turned the spokes and got the feel of the ship answering to\r\nhis hand a faint, hot, acrid smell came on a puff of wind, a smell\r\nof burning, though from where he could not say. He glanced back at\r\nthe far-off fires of the fishing camp, and fancied it might be coming\r\nfrom that quarter. There was nowhere else possible for it to come from\r\nexcept the _Southern Cross_, and the _Southern Cross_ showed no sign of\r\nsmoke or fire as she lay there mute and somber, her spars cutting the\r\nstarlit sky and her hull blackening with its shadow the starlit water.\r\n\r\nSo gently did the _Domain_ move that, viewed from the deck, it seemed\r\nthat past her, lying stationary, the reef and the trees were gliding\r\naft.\r\n\r\nThen the pierheads of the reef passed like ghosts or shadows, and the\r\n_Domain_ rose to the swell of the outer sea and sank, bursting the foam\r\naway from her bow like snow.\r\n\r\nFloyd gave the wheel over to the bos'n, and stood for a moment looking\r\naft across the sea; then he turned and went below, where Isbel was\r\nwaiting for him in the cabin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCardon, left on deck, paced up and down, now with an eye on the\r\nbinnacle card, now glancing aft, as though on the watch for something\r\nhe expected to appear in the wake of the schooner.\r\n\r\nThe wind had freshened, and the _Domain_ was making a good eight knots.\r\nNot a cloud was to be seen in the star-spangled sky, nor a sail on the\r\nsea line, nor a sign now of the island.\r\n\r\nThe atoll island does not show up well at night. It is less an island\r\nthan a kink in the sea over which a vessel may trip just as a man trips\r\nover a kink in a carpet, and, looking back now as Cardon was looking,\r\nnothing could be seen of the shore they had left.\r\n\r\nTill suddenly Cardon drew in his breath, clutched the after rail, and\r\nstood motionless and gazing at a pale orange-colored glow marking the\r\nsky on the sea line they were leaving.\r\n\r\nEven as he watched the glow deepened in color to an angry red.\r\n\r\nA great fire was in progress over there. One might have fancied that\r\nthe whole of Pearl Island had caught alight and was blazing like a\r\ntorch in the wind. But Cardon knew better. He knew that what he was\r\nwatching was the destruction of the _Southern Cross_.\r\n\r\nWhen he had seen Schumer going down into the hold with the light he had\r\nguessed what was forward. Schumer had fired the vessel, and then, to\r\nmake sure, he had gone into the fo'c'sle with Luckman to fire her in a\r\nfresh place.\r\n\r\nThe fire had proclaimed itself now, and Schumer and his companion,\r\nbottled up in the fo'c'sle, would by this be beyond praying for.\r\n\r\nCardon had said nothing to Floyd of his suspicions, and now as he\r\nwatched them verified he determined to keep the matter still to himself.\r\n\r\nThere was no use in troubling the mind of Floyd. As for his own mind,\r\nhe was not in the least troubled.\r\n\r\nWhat Schumer had prepared for another he was receiving himself, and\r\nCardon was not the man to pity a traitor and a murderer or to quarrel\r\nwith the justice of fate.\r\n\r\nBut it was strange beyond imagination to watch that steady, silent,\r\ndistant glow, knowing what it meant.\r\n\r\nHe watched it increasing to a certain point and decrease to a certain\r\npoint. Of a sudden, with a heave and flicker, it went out, and the\r\nstars burned clear where the glow had been.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ had sunk at her anchorage, and Cardon, turning\r\naway, left the deck and came down to the cabin where Floyd and the girl\r\nwere seated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENVOI\r\n\r\nSome three weeks later the _Domain_ cast anchor in Sydney harbor, and\r\nCardon, after the port authorities and the health officer had been\r\non board, took a shore boat for the quay. Floyd and Isbel did not\r\naccompany him. He was going to interview Hakluyt, and he judged that he\r\nwould do the business better if he did it alone.\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand to them as he rowed off, and when he reached the quay\r\nhe made straight for Hakluyt's office.\r\n\r\nHakluyt was in, but was engaged, and Cardon waited in an outer room\r\npatiently enough for some twenty minutes. He was in no hurry, and when\r\nat last he was shown into the room where the shipowner was seated at\r\nhis desk he showed no hurry to begin the business he had on hand.\r\n\r\nHe was studying Hakluyt.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said Hakluyt, after the pause that followed Cardon's\r\nannouncement and while that person was comfortably taking his seat,\r\n\"and what can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Cardon. \"I have come to tell you that Luckman has\r\nburned the _Southern Cross_, according to arrangement with you, and\r\nthat I have all the evidence in my pocket, that he tried to do away\r\nwith Mr. Floyd according to agreement, and that I have witnesses of\r\nthe plot. In other words, my dear man, that your game is up and that\r\nit rests entirely with me whether I close my fist on you or let you go\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\nHakluyt said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"All your pearls are gone,\" said Cardon, lighting a cigarette. \"Floyd\r\nhas got them. They are worth a good many thousand. I have taken your\r\nschooner, the _Domain_, and you have here and now to make out a paper\r\nselling her to me for the sum of--shall we say five thousand?--not\r\none penny of which you will ever receive. I am going to take her to\r\n'Frisco, and if you make one kick or give one squeal or try one dirty\r\ntrick I will put you in quod as sure as my name is Jack Cardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is blackmail,\" said Hakluyt, sweating and grinning at the same\r\ntime, and in all his life Cardon had never seen anything stranger than\r\nthat grin.\r\n\r\n\"This is blackmail!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" replied the other, \"but what I want to point out to\r\nyou is that there is no resistance. You are absolutely tied up. I have\r\nLuckman and Schumer in the hollow, of my hand, a whole island full of\r\nKanaka witnesses, _and_ the sunken schooner; also Floyd and a native\r\ngirl. Well, what do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Schumer?\" cried Hakluyt, who seemed now like a person dazed\r\nby a blow.\r\n\r\n\"He's with Luckman, and I can only say this--he can be produced when\r\nwanted.\" Then, suddenly bursting out: \"He is where you sent him. Dead\r\nin the fo'c'sle of the ship that he sank. He, and Luckman along with\r\nhim. Blackmail! Do you think if I were working this thing for my own\r\nhand I would stoop to blackmail _you_? No, sir. I'm working this for\r\nFloyd, who is a soft-shell Englishman, as good as they make them, but a\r\nchild against ruffians of your cut. I'm squeezing you for him, and if\r\nyou don't like my loving embrace say so and I'll call in the law to do\r\nthe business. Now I give you one minute to decide. Do you stick out or\r\ndo you give in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I give in,\" said Hakluyt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in hyphenation have been retained.\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\nIncorrect page numbers in the Table of Contents have been corrected.",
