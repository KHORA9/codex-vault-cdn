It may be regarded as a type area, for the\r\nhistory of its streams and the effects of glaciation are\r\nrepresentative of those of the entire State. With this idea in mind,\r\nthe field work on which this study is based included a traverse of\r\neach stream valley and an examination of minor features, as well as a\r\nconsideration of the broader regional problems. Much detailed and\r\nlocal description, therefore, is included in the text.\r\n\r\nThe matter in the present bulletin formed the main theme of a thesis\r\non \"Drainage and Glaciation in the Central Housatonic Basin\" which was\r\nsubmitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of\r\ndoctor of philosophy at Yale University.\r\n\r\nThe field work was done in 1907 and 1908 under the direction of\r\nProfessor Herbert E. Gregory. I am also indebted to the late Professor\r\nJoseph Barrell and to Dr. Isaiah Bowman for helpful cooperation in the\r\npreparation of the original thesis, and to Dr. H. H. Robinson for\r\nassistance in preparing this paper for publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              DRAINAGE MODIFICATIONS AND GLACIATION IN\r\n                   THE DANBURY REGION, CONNECTICUT\r\n                              --------\r\n                          By Ruth S. Harvey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGIONAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region discussed in this bulletin is situated in western\r\nConnecticut and is approximately 8 miles wide and 18 miles long in a\r\nnorth-south direction, as shown on fig. 1.[1] Throughout, the rocks\r\nare crystalline and include gneiss, schist, and marble--the\r\nmetamorphosed equivalents of a large variety of ancient sedimentary\r\nand igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this report, the geologic history may be said to\r\nbegin with the regional uplift which marked the close of the Mesozoic.\r\nBy that time the mountains formed by Triassic and Jurassic folding and\r\nfaulting had been worn down to a peneplain, now much dissected but\r\nstill recognizable in the accordant level of the mountain tops.\r\n\r\nErosion during Cretaceous time resulted in the construction of a\r\npiedmont plain extending from an undetermined line 30 to 55 miles\r\nnorth of the present Connecticut shore to a point south of Long\r\nIsland.[2] This plain is thought to have been built up of\r\nunconsolidated sands, clays, and gravels, the debris of the Jurassic\r\nmountains. Inland the material consisted of river-made or land\r\ndeposits; outwardly it merged into coastal plain deposits. When the\r\nplain was uplifted, these loose gravels were swept away. In New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and New Jersey, however, portions of the Cretaceous\r\ndeposits are still to be found. Such deposits are present, also, on\r\nthe north shore of Long Island, and a well drilled at Barren Island on\r\nthe south shore revealed not less than 500 feet of Cretaceous\r\nstrata.[3] The existence of such thick deposits within 30 miles of the\r\nConnecticut shore and certain peculiarities in the drainage have led\r\nto the inference that the Cretaceous cover extended over the southern\r\npart of Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The streams and other topographic features of the Danbury\r\n   region are shown in detail on the Danbury and the New Milford\r\n   sheets of the United States Topographic Atlas. These sheets may be\r\n   obtained from the Director of the United States Geological Survey,\r\n   Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It was probably not less than 30 miles, for that is the\r\n   distance from the mouth of Still River, where the Housatonic enters\r\n   a gorge in the crystallines, to the sea. Fifty-five miles is the\r\n   distance to the sea from the probable old head of Housatonic River\r\n   on Wassaic Creek, near Amenia, New York.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Veatch, A. C., Slichter, C. S., Bowman, Isaiah, Crosby,\r\n   W. O., and Horton. R. E., Underground water resources of Long\r\n   Island: U. S. G. S., PP. 44, p. 188 and fig. 24, 1906.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA general uplift of the region brought this period of deposition to a\r\nclose. As the peneplain, probably with a mantle of Cretaceous\r\ndeposits, was raised to its present elevation, the larger streams kept\r\npace with the uplift by incising their valleys. The position of the\r\nsmaller streams, however, was greatly modified in the development of\r\nthe new drainage system stimulated by the uplift. The modern drainage\r\nsystem may be assumed to have been at first consequent, that is,\r\ndependent for its direction on the slope of the uplifted plain, but it\r\nwas not long before the effect of geologic structure began to make\r\nitself felt. In the time when all the region was near baselevel, the\r\nharder rocks had no advantage over the softer ones, and streams\r\nwandered where they pleased. But after uplift, the streams began to\r\ncut into the plain, and those flowing over limestone or schist\r\ndeepened, then widened their valleys much faster than could the\r\nstreams which flowed over the resistant granite and gneiss. By a\r\nsystem of stream piracy and shifting, similar to that which has taken\r\nplace throughout the Newer Appalachians, the smaller streams in time\r\nbecame well adjusted to the structure. They are of the class called\r\nsubsequents; on the other hand, the Housatonic, which dates at least\r\nfrom the beginning of the uplift if not from the earlier period of\r\npeneplanation, is an antecedent stream.\r\n\r\nThe complex rock surface of western Connecticut had reached a stage of\r\nmature dissection when the region was invaded by glaciers.[4] The ice\r\nsheet scraped off and redistributed the mantle of decayed rock which\r\ncovered the surface and in places gouged out the bedrock. The\r\nresulting changes were of a minor order, for the main features of the\r\nlandscape and the principal drainage lines were the same in preglacial\r\ntime as they are today. It is thus seen that the history of the\r\nsmaller streams like those considered in this report involves three\r\nfactors: (1) the normal tendencies of stream development, (2) the\r\ninfluence of geologic structure, and (3) the effect of glaciation.\r\n\r\nThe cover of glacial deposits is generally thin, but marked\r\nvariations exist. The fields are overspread with coarse till\r\ncontaining pebbles 6 inches in diameter to huge boulders of 12 feet or\r\nmore. The abundance, size, and composition of the boulders in the till\r\nof a given locality is well represented by the stone fences which\r\nborder fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This stage of glaciation is presumably Wisconsin. No\r\n   definite indication of any older glacial deposits was found.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 1.~ Present drainage of the Danbury region.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regional depression which marked the close of the glacial period\r\nslackened the speed of many rivers and caused them to deposit great\r\nquantities of modified or assorted drift. Since glacial time, these\r\ndeposits have been dissected and formed into the terraces which are\r\ncharacteristic of the rivers of the region. A form of terrace even\r\nmore common than the river-made terrace is the kame terrace found\r\nalong borders of the lowlands. Eskers in the Danbury region have not\r\nthe elongated snake-like form by which they are distinguished in some\r\nparts of the country, notably Maine; on the contrary, they are\r\ncharacteristically short and broad, many having numerous branches at\r\nthe southern end like the distributaries of an aggrading river. The\r\nmaterial of the eskers ranges from coarse sand to pebbles four inches\r\nin diameter, the average size being from one to two inches. No\r\nexposures were observed which showed a regular diminution in the\r\ncoarseness of the material toward their southern end. The clean-washed\r\nesker gravels afford little encouragement to plant growth, and the\r\nrain water drains away rapidly through the porous gravel.\r\nConsequently, accumulations of stratified drift are commonly barren\r\nplaces. A desert vegetation of coarse grasses, a kind of wiry moss,\r\nand \"everlastings\" (_Gnaphalius decurrens_) are the principal growth.\r\nRattlebox (_Crotolaria sagittalis_), steeplebush (_Spiraea tomentosa_),\r\nsweet fern (_Comptonia asplenifolia_), and on the more fertile\r\neskers--especially on the lower, wetter part of the slope--golden rod,\r\nox-eyed daisy, birch, and poplar are also present. All the eskers\r\nobserved were found to be similar: they ranged in breadth across the\r\ntop from 100 to 150 feet and the side slopes were about 20 degrees.\r\nOnly a single heavily wooded esker was found, and this ran through a\r\nforest region.\r\n\r\nThe accumulations of stratified drift are distinguished from other\r\nfeatures in the landscape by their smoother and rounder outlines, by\r\ntheir habit of lying unconformably on the bedrock without reference to\r\nold erosion lines, and by a slightly different tone in the color of\r\nthe vegetation covering the water-laid material. The difference in\r\ncolor, which is due to the unique elements in the flora of these\r\nareas, may cause a hill of stratified drift in summer to present a\r\nlighter green color than that of surrounding hills of boulder clay or\r\nof the original rock slopes; in winter the piles of stratified drift\r\nstand out because of the uniform light tawny red of the dried grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~State Geol.

The base\r\n   of a ridge in which rock is exposed is seen at the left; a\r\n   crescent-shaped lateral moraine bordering the valley lies at the\r\n   right.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROCKY RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RIVER AND ITS VALLEY\r\n\r\nRocky River begins its course as a rapid mountain brook in a rough\r\nhighland, where the mantle of till in many places is insufficient to\r\nconceal the rock ledges (fig. 1). Near Sherman, about four miles from\r\nits source, it enters a broad flood plain and meanders over a flat,\r\nswampy floor which is somewhat encumbered with deposits of stratified\r\ndrift and till. Rocky hills border the valley and rise abruptly from\r\nthe lowland. The few tributaries of the river in this part of its\r\ncourse are normal in direction.\r\n\r\nAbout six miles below Sherman, Rocky River enters Wood Creek Swamp,\r\nwhich is 5-1/2 miles long by about one mile wide and completely covers\r\nthe valley floor, extending even into tributary valleys. Within the\r\nswamp the river is joined by Squantz Pond Brook and Wood Creek.\r\nTributaries to Wood Creek include Mountain Brook and the stream\r\npassing through Barses Pond and Neversink Pond. The head of Barses\r\nPond is separated from the swamp only by a low ridge of till.\r\nNeversink Pond with its inlet gorge and its long southern tributary\r\nrecord significant drainage modifications, as described in the section\r\nentitled \"The Neversink-Danbury Valley.\"\r\n\r\nWithin and along the margin of Wood Creek Swamp, also east of Wood\r\nCreek and at Barses Pond, are rounded, elongated ridges of till, some\r\nof which might be called drumlins. East of Neversink Pond is the\r\nlateral moraine shown in Pl. I. From the mouth of Wood Creek to\r\nJerusalem, Rocky River is a quiet stream wandering between low banks\r\nthrough flat meadows, which are generally swampy almost to the foot of\r\nthe bordering hills.\r\n\r\nNear Jerusalem bridge two small branches enter Rocky River.\r\nImmediately north of the bridge is a level swampy area about one-half\r\nmile in length. Where the valley closes in again, bedrock is exposed\r\nnear the stream, and beginning at a point one-half mile below (north\r\nof) Jerusalem, Rocky River--a swift torrent choked by boulders of\r\ngreat size--deserves its name.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its rapid current, however, the river is unable to move\r\nthese boulders, and for nearly three miles one can walk dry-shod on\r\nthose that lie in midstream.\r\n\r\nAt two or three places below Jerusalem, in quiet reaches above rapids,\r\nthe river has taken its first step toward making a flood plain by\r\nbuilding tiny beaches. One-half mile above the mouth of the river the\r\nvalley widens and on the gently rising south bank there are several\r\nwell-marked terraces about three feet in height and shaped out of\r\nglacial material. A delta and group of small islands at the mouth of\r\nRocky River indicate the transporting power of the stream and the\r\nrelative weakness of the slow-moving Housatonic.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS OF THE VALLEY TO GEOLOGIC STRUCTURE\r\n\r\nRocky River is classed with streams which are comformable to the rock\r\nstructure. This conclusion rests largely on the analogy between Rocky\r\nRiver and other rivers of this region. The latter very commonly are\r\nlocated on belts of limestone, or limestone and schist, and their\r\nextension is along the strike. The interfluvial ridges are generally\r\ncomposed of the harder rocks. The valleys of the East Aspetuck and\r\nWomenshenuck Brook on the north side of the Housatonic, and of the\r\nStill, the Umpog, Beaver Brook, the upper Saugatuck, and part of Rocky\r\nRiver are on limestone beds (fig. 2). In the valleys between Town Hill\r\nand Spruce Mountain (south of Danbury), two ravines northwest of\r\nGrassy Plain (near Bethel), and the Saugatuck valley north of Umpawaug\r\nPond, the limestone bed is largely buried under drift, talus, and\r\norganic deposits, but remnants which reveal the character of the\r\nvalley floors have been found. The parallelism between the courses of\r\nthese streams and that of Rocky River and the general resemblance in\r\nthe form of their valleys, flat-floored with steep-sided walls, as\r\nwell as the scattered outcrops of limestone in the valley, have led to\r\nthe inference that Rocky River, like the others, is a subsequent\r\nstream developed on beds of weaker rock along lines of foliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 2.~ Geological map of Still River Valley.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Geological Map of Connecticut[5] shows that the valleys of Still\r\nRiver, Womenshenuck Brook, Aspetuck River, and upper Rocky River are\r\ndeveloped on Stockbridge limestone. The lower valley of Rocky River\r\nis, however, mapped as Becket gneiss and Thomaston granite gneiss.\r\nAlthough the only outcrops along lower Rocky River are of granite, it\r\nis believed that a belt of limestone or schist, now entirely removed,\r\ninitially determined the course of the river. The assumption of an\r\nirregular belt of limestone in this position would account for the\r\nseries of gorges and flood plains in the vicinity of Jerusalem bridge\r\nand for the broad drift-filled valley at the mouth of Rocky River.\r\nThese features are difficult to explain on any other basis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Gregory, H. E., Robinson, H. H., Preliminary geological\r\n   map of Connecticut; Geol. and Nat. Hist. Survey. Bull. 7, 1907.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNCTION OF ROCKY AND HOUSATONIC RIVERS\r\n\r\nOne of the distinguishing features of Rocky River is the angle at\r\nwhich it joins the Housatonic (fig. 1). The tributaries of a normal\r\ndrainage system enter their master stream at acute angles, an\r\narrangement which involves the least expenditure of energy. Rocky\r\nRiver, however, enters the Housatonic against the course of the\r\nlatter, that is, the tributary points upstream. Still River and other\r\nsouthern tributaries of the Housatonic exhibit the same feature, thus\r\nproducing a barbed drainage, which indicates that some factor\r\ninterfered with the normal development of tributary streams. Barbed\r\ndrainage generally results from the reversal of direction of the\r\nmaster stream[6], but it is impossible to suppose that the Housatonic\r\nwas ever reversed. As will appear, it is an antecedent master stream\r\ncrossing the crystalline rocks of western Connecticut regardless of\r\nstructure, and its course obliquely across the strike accounts for\r\nthe peculiar orientation of its southern tributaries, which are\r\nsubsequent streams whose position is determined by the nature of the\r\nrock. For the same reason, the northern tributaries of the Housatonic\r\npresent the usual relations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Leverett, Frank, Glacial formations and drainage features\r\n   of the Erie and Ohio basins: U. S. Geol. Survey Mon. 41, pp. 88-91,\r\n   figs. 1 and 2, 1902. See, also, the Genoa, Watkins, Penn Yan, and\r\n   Naples (New York) topographic atlas sheets.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABNORMAL PROFILE\r\n\r\nThe airline distance from the bend in Rocky River at Sherman to its\r\nmouth at the Housatonic is 2-3/4 miles, but the course of the river\r\nbetween these two points is 15 miles, or 5.4 times the airline\r\ndistance. This is a more extraordinary digression than that of\r\nTennessee River, which deserts its ancestral course to the Gulf and\r\nflows northwest into the Ohio, multiplying the length of its course\r\n3-1/3 times. The fall of Rocky River between Sherman and its mouth is\r\n240 feet or 16 feet to the mile, and were the river able to take a\r\ndirect course the fall would be 87 feet to the mile. The possibility\r\nof capture would seem to be imminent from these figures, but in\r\nreality there is no chance of it, for an unbroken mountain ridge of\r\nresistant rock lies between the two forks of the river. This barrier\r\nis not likely to be crossed by any stream until the whole region has\r\nbeen reduced to a peneplain.\r\n\r\nMeasured from the head of its longest branch, Rocky River is about 19\r\nmiles long and falls 950 feet. Of this fall, 710 feet occurs in the\r\nfirst 4 miles and 173 feet in the last 2-1/2 miles of its course. For\r\nthe remaining distance of 12-1/2 miles, in which the river after\r\nflowing south doubles back on itself, the fall is 67 feet, or slightly\r\nless than 5-1/2 feet to the mile (fig. 3, A).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 3.~ Profiles of present and preglacial Rocky River.\r\n   Elevations at a, b, c and i are from U. S. G. S. map.\r\n   Elevation at d is estimated from R. E. Dakin's records.\r\n   Elevations at e, f, g and h are from R. E. Dakin's records.\r\n   The U. S. G. S. figures for the same are enclosed in parenthesis.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn tabular form the figures, taken from the Danbury and\r\nNew Milford atlas sheets and from reports of R. E. Dakin, are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Miles      Fall in feet per mile\r\nSource to Sherman            4              177.5\r\nSherman to Wood Creek        8                6.25\r\nWood Creek to Jerusalem      4.5              3.8\r\nJerusalem to mouth           2.5             69.2\r\n\r\n\r\nNear Jerusalem, where Rocky River makes its sudden change\r\nin grade, there is an abrupt change in the form of the valley\r\nfrom broad and flat-bottomed to narrow and V-shaped. The\r\nprofile of Rocky River is thus seen to be sharply contrasted with\r\nthat of a normal stream, which is characterised throughout its\r\ncourse by a decreasing slope.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREGLACIAL COURSE\r\n\r\nThe present profile of Rocky River and the singular manner in which\r\nthe lower course of the river is doubled back on the upper course are\r\nbelieved to represent changes wrought by glaciation. Before the advent\r\nof the glacier, Rocky River probably flowed southward through the\r\n\"Neversink-Danbury Valley,\" to be described later, and joined the\r\nStill at Danbury, as shown in fig. 4. The profile of the stream at\r\nthis stage in its history is shown in fig. 3, B.\r\n\r\nAt Sherman a low col separates Rocky River basin from that of the\r\nsmall northward flowing stream which enters the Housatonic about a\r\nmile below Gaylordsville. Streams by headward erosion at both ends of\r\nthe belt of limestone and schist on which they are situated have\r\nreduced this divide to an almost imperceptible swell. The rock\r\noutcrops in the channel show that the glacier did not produce any\r\nchange in the divide by damming, though it may have lowered it by\r\nscouring. Assume that at one time a divide also existed on the eastern\r\nfork of Rocky River, for example near Jerusalem. According to this\r\nhypothesis there was, north of this latter divide, a short northward\r\nflowing branch of the Housatonic located on a belt of weak rock,\r\nsimilar to the small stream which now flows northward from Sherman, and\r\nvery like any of the half-dozen parallel streams in the rock mass\r\nsouth and southwest of Danbury, all of which are subsequent streams\r\nflowing along the strike. While these stream valleys were growing, the\r\nsouthern ends of the same weak belts of rock were held by\r\nsouthward-flowing streams which united in the broad limestone area now\r\noccupied by the city of Danbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 4.~ Preglacial course of Rocky-Still River.\r\n   Dotted lines show present courses of the two rivers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe southward-flowing streams whose heads were, respectively, above\r\nSherman and near Jerusalem joined at the southern end of the long\r\nridge which includes Towner Hill and Green Mountain. Thence the stream\r\nflowed southward along the valley now occupied by Wood Creek and\r\nreached Still River by way of the valley which extends southward from\r\nNeversink Pond (fig. 4).\r\n\r\nThe preglacial course of Rocky River, as above outlined, is subject to\r\npossible modification in one minor feature, namely, the point where\r\nthe east and west forks joined. The junction may have been where\r\nNeversink Pond is now situated, or three miles farther south than the\r\nindicated junction near the mouth of Wood Creek. A low ridge of till\r\nis the only barrier that at present prevents the western branch from\r\nflowing into the head of Barses Pond and thence into Neversink Pond\r\n(fig. 1).\r\n\r\nAs thus reconstructed the greater part of Rocky River formerly\r\nbelonged to the Still-Umpog system and formed a normal tributary in\r\nthat distant period when the Still joined the Saugatuck on its way to\r\nthe Sound (fig. 9). However, the normal condition was not lasting, for\r\nthe reversal of Still River, as later described, brought about a\r\ncomplex arrangement of barbed streams (fig. 4) which remained until\r\nmodified by glacial action.\r\n\r\nIn a large stream system which has been reversed, considerable\r\nevidence may be gathered from the angle at which tributary streams\r\nenter. As the original direction of Rocky River in its last 2-1/2\r\nmiles is unchanged, normal tributaries should be expected; whereas\r\nbetween Jerusalem and the head of the stream entering Neversink Pond\r\nfrom the south, in accordance with the hypothesis that this portion of\r\nthe stream was reversed, tributaries pointing upstream might be\r\nexpected. Such little gullies as join Rocky River near its mouth are\r\nnormal in direction; between Jerusalem and the mouth of Wood Creek, a\r\ndistance of 4-1/2 miles, there are no distinct tributaries. South of\r\nthe mouth of Wood Creek are four tributaries: (1) the brook which\r\nenters the valley from the west about one mile south of Neversink\r\nPond, (2) Balls Brook, which empties into Neversink Pond, and (3) two\r\nstreams on the east side--Mountain Brook and one other unnamed (fig.\r\n1). All these, except Mountain Brook, are normal to the reconstructed\r\ndrainage. The evidence of the tributaries, though not decisive, is\r\nthus favorable to the hypothesis of reversal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURIED CHANNEL\r\n\r\nFigures 3 and 5 show what is known of the buried channel of Rocky\r\nRiver. The only definite information as to rock levels is that derived\r\nfrom the drill holes made by R. E. Dakin for the J. A. P. Crisfield\r\nContracting Company in connection with work on a reservoir for the\r\nConnecticut Light and Power Company. Numerous holes were drilled at\r\nthe points indicated on fig. 5 as No. 8, D, J, No. 7+1000, and No. 7,\r\nbut only those showing the lowest rock levels need be considered. In\r\nthe following account the elevations quoted are those determined by R.\r\nE. Dakin which differ, as shown in fig. 3, A, from those of the New\r\nMilford atlas sheet.\r\n\r\nBetween the mouth of Wood Creek and Jerusalem bridge holes made near\r\nthe river show that the depth of the drift--chiefly sand, gravel, and\r\nclay--varies from 45 to 140 feet. The greatest thickness of drift,\r\nconsisting of humus, quicksand and clay, is 140 feet at a point 20\r\nfeet from the east bank of Rocky River and about 1-3/4 miles north of\r\nthe mouth of Wood Creek (fig. 5, D). Although some allowance should be\r\nmade for glacial scouring, the rock level at this point, 244 feet, is\r\nso much lower than any other record obtained between this point and\r\nDanbury that one is obliged to assume a buried channel with a level at\r\nDanbury at least 75 feet below the rock level found in the lowest well\r\nrecord.[7] It is probable that this well is not situated where the\r\nrock is lowest, that is, it may be on one side of the old Still River\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Well of J. Hornig, rear of Bottling Works, near foot of\r\n   Tower Place, 35 ft. to rock, indicated at _a_, fig. 5. The well of\r\n   Bartley & Clancey, 94 White Street, 70 ft. to rock, is also\r\n   indicated at _b_, fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe level obtained at No. 8 is from a hole drilled within 50 feet of\r\nthe river. The drill struck rock at an elevation of 316 feet after\r\npassing through 69 feet of quicksand, gravel, and till. This is\r\nclearly not within the channel as it is quite impossible to reconcile\r\nthe figure with that at D, less than a mile distant.\r\n\r\nSouth of Jerusalem bridge at J, 150 feet from the river, a hole was\r\nbored through 95 feet of clay, sand, and gravel before striking rock\r\nat an elevation of 298 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 5.~ Rocky River Valley. Diagram indicating lowest\r\n   rock levels which have been discovered by drilling.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the point marked No. 7+1000, about 1-1/4 miles from the mouth of\r\nRocky River, the evidence derived from 8 drill holes, bored at\r\ndistances ranging from 200 to 550 feet from the right bank, shows the\r\ndrift cover to be from 48 to 72 feet in thickness. At 200 feet from\r\nthe river the drill passed through 72 feet of sand, clay, and gravel\r\nbefore striking rock at 303 feet above sea-level.\r\n\r\nAt No. 7, about one mile from the mouth of Rocky River, a hole drilled\r\n415 feet from the right bank showed 58 feet of drift, consisting of\r\nclay, sand, gravel, and boulders. The drill reached rock at 342 feet,\r\nwhich is the figure given by R. E. Dakin for the elevation of the\r\nriver at this point. Drill holes made, respectively, at 50 and 60 feet\r\nto the right of this one showed a drift cover of 61 feet, so that the\r\nunderlying rock rises only 4 feet in a distance of 475 feet to the\r\neast of the river.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing evidence, showing a rock level at D 98 feet lower than\r\nthat at No. 7, leaves no doubt that the preglacial course of Rocky\r\nRiver was to the south from No. 7, and there is nothing in the\r\ntopography between Jerusalem and Danbury to make improbable the\r\nexistence of a buried channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF GLACIATION\r\n\r\nThe preglacial history of Rocky River as outlined assumes that before\r\nthe glacier covered this part of Connecticut the present lower course\r\nof Rocky River was separated from the rest of the system by a divide\r\nsituated somewhere between the present mouth of the river and the\r\nmouth of Wood Creek. It remains to be shown by what process Rocky\r\nRiver was cut off from its southern outlet into Still River and forced\r\nup its eastern branch and over the col into a tributary of the\r\nHousatonic. Though the preglacial course of Rocky River appears to be\r\nmore natural than the present one, it is really a longer course to the\r\nHousatonic; the older route being 32 miles, whereas the present course\r\nis 19 miles. This fact explains, in part, why the glacier had little\r\ndifficulty in altering the preglacial drainage, and how the change so\r\neffected became permanent. Eccentric as the resulting system of\r\ndrainage is, it would have been still more so had Rocky River when\r\nponded overflowed at the head of its western instead of its eastern\r\nfork, taken its way past Sherman into the Housatonic near\r\nGaylordsville, and discharging at this point lost the advantage of the\r\nfall of the Housatonic between Gaylordsville and Boardman.\r\n\r\nIn glaciated regions an area of swamp land may be taken as an\r\nindication of interference by the glacier with the natural run-off.\r\nThe swamp in which Wood Creek joins the upper fork of Rocky River\r\n(fig. 1), was formerly a lake due to a dam built across the lower end\r\nof a river valley. Although the ponded water extended only a short\r\ndistance up the steeper side valleys, it extended several miles up the\r\nmain stream. The whole area of this glacial lake, except two small\r\nponds and the narrow channels through which the river now flows, has\r\nbeen converted into a peat-filled bog having a depth of from 8 to 45\r\nfeet.[8]\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the swampy area on the eastern branch of Rocky\r\nRiver no indication is found of a dam such as would be required for so\r\nextensive a ponding of the waters. Here the valley is very narrow, and\r\nthough the river bed is encumbered with heavy boulders, rock outcrops\r\nare so numerous as to preclude the idea of a drift cover raising the\r\nwater level. This is just the condition to be expected if Rocky River\r\nreached its present outlet by overtopping a low col at the head of its\r\nformer eastern branch.\r\n\r\nThe southern end of the Neversink Pond valley is the only other place\r\nwhose level is so low that drift deposits could have interfered with\r\nthe Rocky River drainage. The moraine at the head of this valley,\r\ncrossing the country some two miles north of the city of Danbury and\r\nbinding together two prominent north-and-south ridges, was evidently\r\nthe barrier which choked the Rocky River valley near its mouth and\r\nturned back the preglacial river.\r\n\r\nWhen Rocky River was thus ponded its lowest outlet was found to be at\r\nthe head of its eastern fork. Here the waters spilled over the old\r\ndivide and took possession of the channel of a small stream draining\r\ninto the Housatonic. Accordingly Rocky River should be found cutting\r\nits bed where it crosses the former divide. It seems reasonable to\r\nregard the gorge half-way between Jerusalem bridge and Housatonic\r\nRiver as approximately the position of the preglacial divide and to\r\nconsider the small flat area to the north of Jerusalem bridge as a\r\nflood plain on softer rock, worn down as low as the outcrops of more\r\nresistant rock occurring farther down the valley will permit. The\r\nreversal of the river may account for the sudden transition from a\r\nflat-bottomed valley to a rocky gorge; and for the abrupt change in\r\nthe profile, bringing the steepest part of the river near its mouth.\r\nThe increased volume of water flowing through the channel since\r\nglacial time has plainly cut down the bed of the ravine between\r\nJerusalem and the river's mouth, but the channel is still far from\r\nbeing graded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Report of soundings made in 1907 by T. T. Giffen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEVERSINK-DANBURY VALLEY.\r\n\r\nBetween Neversink Pond and Danbury extends a deep rock valley, in\r\nplaces filled with drift. As has been shown, this valley was probably\r\noccupied in preglacial time by Rocky River, which then flowed\r\nsouthward. At its southern end is Still River, which flows through\r\nDanbury from west to east.\r\n\r\nThe most important tributary of the Still rises northwest of the city,\r\njust beyond the New York-Connecticut boundary line, and has two forks.\r\nThe northern fork, which drains East Lake, Padanaram Reservoir, and\r\nMargerie Pond, flows along the northeast side of Clapboard Ridge. The\r\nsouthern fork has two branches; the northern one includes the\r\nreservoirs of Upper Kohanza and Lake Kohanza, while the upper waters\r\nof the southern branch have been recently dammed to form an extensive\r\nreservoir. On approaching the city, the northernmost fork (draining\r\nEast Lake) turns sharply out of its southeast course and flows in a\r\ndirection a little east of north. At the end of Clapboard Ridge, the\r\nstream makes a detour around a knoll of coarse stratified drift. From\r\nthis turn until it joins Still River, a distance of about a mile, the\r\nstream occupies a broad and partly swampy valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the cemetery in this valley (fig. 1, C) are two eskers of symmetric\r\nform, each a few hundred yards in length and trending nearly parallel\r\nwith the valley axis. East of the valley, and about 1-1/2 miles north\r\nof the cemetery, is a broad, flat-topped ridge of till with rock\r\nexposed at the ends, forming a barrier which doubtless existed in\r\npreglacial time. West of the valley is a hill with rock foundation\r\nrounded out on the northeast side by a mass of drift. The preglacial\r\ncourse of Rocky River was between the outcrops at these two\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nNorthwest of the cemetery for one and a half miles the uneven surface\r\nis formed of till and small patches of stratified drift. In a swamp\r\nnear the north end of the cemetery is a curved esker with lobes\r\nextending south and southwest. One mile north of this swamp is an area\r\nof excessively coarse till containing boulders which range in diameter\r\nfrom 6 to 10 feet and forming a low ridge separating two ravines, in\r\nwhich head streams flowing in opposite directions. The area of coarse\r\ntill is bounded on the north by a long sinuous esker of coarse gravel\r\nterminating in a flat fan, which is superposed on a field of fine\r\ntill. Associated with the esker is an interesting group of kames and\r\nkettleholes, the largest kettlehole being distinguished by distinct\r\nplant zones banding the sides of the depression.\r\n\r\nNorth of the area of boulders, eskers, and kames just described lies a\r\nswamp whose surface is 30 to 40 feet below the upper level of the kame\r\ngravels. Soundings made by T. T. Giffen revealed the presence of 36\r\nfeet of peat and 2 feet of silt overlying firm sand, so that 70 feet\r\nis the minimum estimate for the difference in level between the\r\nsurface of the gravels and the floor of the swamp.\r\n\r\nBelow the rocky cliffs which line the valley sides are boulders\r\nbrought by the ice from near-by ledges, and about one-half mile above\r\nthe head of the swamp are remnants of a terrace standing 20 to 30 feet\r\nabove the level of the stream. Although the terrace appears to consist\r\nof till, it may conceal a rock floor which was cut by a former stream.\r\nAs the valley is followed toward Neversink Pond, the various features\r\nof a till-coated, rock-floored valley are seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 6.~ Course of Still River. Dotted lines show the\r\n   preglacial channels.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILL RIVER\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nStill River presents several unusual features, as shown in fig. 6.\r\nTributaries from the west and south unite at Danbury to form a stream\r\nflowing northward opposite to the regional land slope. Near its\r\njunction with the Housatonic, the river flows northward, whereas its\r\nmaster stream half a mile distant flows southward. The lower valley of\r\nthe river is broad and flat and apparently much out of proportion to\r\nthe present stream; it is, indeed, comformable in size and direction\r\nwith the valley of the Housatonic above the mouth of the Still. The\r\nHousatonic, however, instead of choosing the broad lowland in the\r\nlimestone formation, spread invitingly before it, turns aside and\r\nflows through a narrow gorge cut in resistant gneiss, schist, and\r\nigneous intrusives. The headwaters of the Still mingle with those of\r\nthe Croton system, and its chief southern branch, the Umpog, is\r\ninterlaced with the sources of the Saugatuck on a divide marked by\r\nglacial drift and swamps. The explanation of these features involves\r\nnot only the history of the Still River system, but also that of the\r\nHousatonic.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the present unusual arrangement of streams in\r\nthe Still River system, four hypotheses may be considered:\r\n\r\nI. Still River valley is the ancient bed of the Housatonic from which\r\nthat river has been diverted through reversal caused by a glacial dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Housatonic has always had its present southeasterly course,\r\nbut the Still, heading at some point in its valley north of Danbury,\r\nflowed initially southward through one of four possible outlets. The\r\nlatter stream was later reversed by a glacial dam at the southern end,\r\nor by glacial scouring at the northern end of its valley which removed\r\nthe divide between its headwaters and the Housatonic.\r\n\r\nIII. The Housatonic has always held its present southeasterly course,\r\nand the Still initially flowed southward, as stated above. Reversal in\r\nthis case, however, occurred in a very early stage in the development\r\nof the drainage, as the result of the capture of the headwaters of the\r\nStill by a small tributary of the Housatonic.\r\n\r\nIV. The Housatonic has always held its present southeasterly course,\r\nbut the Still has developed from the beginning as a subsequent stream\r\nin the direction in which it now flows.\r\n\r\nThe first hypothesis, that the Still is the ancient channel of the\r\nHousatonic, has been advocated by Professor Hobbs, who has stated:\r\n\r\n   \"That the valley of the Still was formerly occupied by a large\r\n   stream is probable from its wide valley area.... The former\r\n   discharge of the waters of the Housatonic through the Still into\r\n   the Croton system, on the one hand, or into the Saugatuck on the\r\n   other, would require the assumption of extremely slight changes\r\n   only in the rock channels which now connect them.... To turn the\r\n   river (the Housatonic) from its course along the limestone\r\n   valley some obstruction or differential uplift within the river\r\n   basin may have been responsible. The former seems to be the more\r\n   probable explanation in view of the large accumulations of drift\r\n   material in the area south and west of Bethel and Danbury.\"\r\n\r\n   \"The structural valleys believed to be present in the\r\n   crystalline rocks of the uplands due to post-Newark deformation\r\n   may well have directed the course of the Housatonic after it had\r\n   once deserted the limestone ... The deep gorge of the Housatonic\r\n   through which the river enters the uplands not only crosses the\r\n   first high ridge of gneiss in the rectilinear direction of one\r\n   of the fault series, but its precipitous walls show the presence\r\n   of minor planes of dislocation, along which the bottom of the\r\n   valley appears to have been depressed.\"[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis proposed by Professor Hobbs and also the second and\r\nthird hypotheses here given involve the supposition of reversal of\r\ndrainage, and their validity rests on the probability that the stream\r\nnow occupying Still River valley formerly flowed southward. The first\r\nand second hypotheses will be considered in the following section.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Hobbs, W. H., Still rivers of western Connecticut: Bull.\r\n   Geol. Soc. Am., vol. 13, pp. 17-26, 1901.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE TO BE EXPECTED IF STILL RIVER HAS BEEN REVERSED\r\n\r\nIf Still River occupies the valley of a reversed stream, the following\r\nphysiographic features should be expected:\r\n\r\n1. A valley with a continuous width corresponding to the size of the\r\nancient stream, or a valley comparatively narrow at the north and\r\nbroadening toward the south.\r\n\r\n2. Tributary valleys pointing upstream with respect to the present\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n3. The regional slope not in accord with the present course of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n4. Extensive glacial filling and ponded waters in the region of the\r\npresent sources of Still River.\r\n\r\n5. Strong glacial scouring at the northern end in default of a glacial\r\ndam at the southern end of the valley, or to assist a dam in its work\r\nof reversing the river. The evidence of glacial erosion would be a\r\nU-shaped valley, overdeepening of the main valley, and tributaries\r\nungraded with respect to the main stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A VALLEY WIDE THROUGHOUT OR BROADENING TOWARD THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of Still River and for several miles north and south of\r\nit there is a plain more than a mile broad. This plain continues\r\nsouthward with a width of about one-half mile until, at Brookfield, it\r\nis interrupted by ledges of bare rock. A little distance south of\r\nBrookfield the valley broadens again to one-half mile, and this width\r\nis retained with some variation as far as Danbury. Drift deposits\r\nalong the border of the valley make it appear narrower in some places\r\nthan is indicated by rock outcrops. Between Brookfield and Danbury the\r\nnarrowest place in the valley is southwest of Beaver Brook Mountain,\r\nwhere the distance between the hills of rock bounding the valley is\r\none-fifth of a mile (fig. 6). Opposite Beaver Brook Mountain, which\r\npresents vertical faces of granite-gneiss toward the valley, is a hill\r\nof limestone. Ice, crowding through this narrow place in the valley,\r\nmust have torn masses of rock from the side walls, so that the valley\r\nis now broader than in preglacial time. The constrictions in the\r\nvalley near Shelter Rock are due to the fact that the preglacial\r\nvalley, now partly buried in till, lies to the north. There are\r\nstretches of broad floor in the valley of Beaver Brook, in the lower\r\nvalley of Umpog Creek, in the fields at the south end of Main Street\r\nin Danbury, about Lake Kanosha, and where the Danbury Fair Grounds are\r\nsituated. In the western part of Danbury, however, and at Mill Plain\r\nthe valley is very narrow, and at the head of Sugar Hollow, the valley\r\nlying east of Spruce Mountain, is a narrow col.\r\n\r\nThe broadest continuous area in the Still-Umpog Valley is, therefore,\r\nin the lower six miles between Brookfield and New Milford; south of\r\nthat portion are several places where the valley is sharply\r\nconstricted; and beyond the head of the Umpog, about one and a half\r\nmiles below West Redding station (fig. 7), the Saugatuck Valley is a\r\nvery narrow gorge. On the whole, the valleys south and southwest of\r\nDanbury are much narrower than the valley of the Still farther north.\r\nIt is evident from these observations that Still River Valley is\r\nneither uniformly broad, nor does it increase in width toward the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nBut if a broad valley is to be accepted as evidence of the work of a\r\nlarge river, then there is too much evidence in the Still River\r\nvalley. The broad areas named above are more or less isolated\r\nlowlands, some of them quite out of the main line of drainage, and can\r\nnot be grouped to form a continuous valley. They can not be attributed\r\nto the Housatonic nor wholly to the work of the insignificant streams\r\nnow draining them. These broad expanses are, in fact, local peneplains\r\ndeveloped on areas of soluble limestone. The rock has dissolved and\r\nthe plain so produced has been made more nearly level by a coating of\r\npeat and glacial sand. In a region of level and undisturbed strata,\r\nsuch as the Ohio or Mississippi Valley, a constant relation may exist\r\nbetween the size of a stream and the valley made by it; but in a\r\nregion of complicated geologic structure, such as western Connecticut,\r\nwhere rocks differ widely in their resistance to erosion, the same\r\nresult is not to be expected. In this region the valleys are commonly\r\ndeveloped on limestone and their width is closely controlled by the\r\nwidth of the belt of limestone. Even the narrow valleys in the upland\r\nsouthwest of Danbury are to be accounted for by the presence of thin\r\nlenses of limestone embedded in gneiss and schist.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Hobbs that Still River valley is too wide to be the\r\nwork of the present stream takes into consideration only the broad\r\nplaces, but when the narrow places are considered it may be said as\r\nwell that the valley is too narrow to be the work of a stream larger\r\nthan the one now occupying it. Valley width has only negative value in\r\ninterpreting the history of Still River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. TRIBUTARY VALLEYS POINTING UPSTREAM\r\n\r\nThe dominant topographic feature of western Connecticut, as may be\r\nseen on the atlas sheets, is elongated oval hills trending north by\r\nwest to south by east, which is the direction of the axes of the folds\r\ninto which the strata were thrown at the time their metamorphism took\r\nplace. Furthermore, the direction of glacial movement in this part of\r\nNew England was almost precisely that of foliation, and scouring by\r\nice merely accentuated the dominant north-south trend of the valleys\r\nand ridges. As a result, the smaller streams developed on the softer\r\nrocks are generally parallel to each other and to the strike of the\r\nrocks. These streams commonly bend around the ends of the hills but do\r\nnot cross them. The narrowness of the belts of soft rock makes it easy\r\nfor the drainage of the valleys to be gathered by a single lengthwise\r\nstream. The Still and its larger tributaries conform in this way to\r\nthe structure.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the Still-Umpog every branch, except two rivulets\r\n1-1/4 miles south of Bethel, points in the normal direction, that is,\r\nto the north, or downstream as the river now flows (fig. 6). The\r\nlargest eastern tributary, Beaver Brook, is in a preglacial valley now\r\nconverted into a swamp the location and size of which are due entirely\r\nto a belt of limestone. It is not impossible that Beaver Brook may\r\nhave once flowed southward toward Bethel, but the limestone at its\r\nmouth, which lies at least 60 feet lower than that at its head, shows\r\nthat if such were ever the case it must have been before the\r\nnorth-flowing Still River had removed the limestone north of Beaver\r\nBrook Swamp.\r\n\r\nOn the flanks of Beaver Brook Mountain are three tributaries which\r\nenter the river against its present course. Examination of the\r\nstructure reveals, however, that these streams like those on the east\r\nside of the river are controlled in their direction by the orientation\r\nof the harder rock masses. The southward flowing stream four miles in\r\nlength which drains the upland west of Beaver Brook Mountain has an\r\nabnormal direction in the upper part of its course, but on reaching\r\nthe flood plain it takes a sharp turn to the north. Above the latter\r\npoint it is in line with the streams near Beaver Brook Mountain and is\r\nabnormal in consequence of a line of weakness in the rock.\r\n\r\nThe lowland lying west of Umpog valley, extending from Main Street in\r\nDanbury to a point one mile beyond Bethel, affords no definite\r\nevidence in regard to the direction of tributaries. In reconstructing\r\nthe history of this valley the chief difficulty arises from the\r\nold-age condition of the flood plain. Drainage channels which must\r\nonce have existed have been obliterated, leaving a swampy plain which\r\nfrom end to end varies less than 20 feet in elevation. It is likely\r\nthat in preglacial times the part of the valley north of Grassy Plain,\r\nif not the entire valley, drained northward into Still River, as now\r\ndo Umpog Creek and Beaver Brook. From this outlet heavy drift deposits\r\nnear the river later cut it off. The lowland is now drained by a\r\nstream which enters the Umpog north of Grassy Plain. Several small\r\nstreams tributary to the Umpog south of Bethel also furnish no\r\nevidence in favor of the reversal of Still River.\r\n\r\nWest of Danbury the tributaries of Still River point upstream on one\r\nside and downstream on the other side of the valley, in conformity\r\nwith the rock structure which is here diagonal to the limestone belt\r\non which the river is located. Their direction in harmony with the\r\ntrend of the rocks has, therefore, no significance in the earlier\r\nhistory of the river.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it appears that no definite conclusions\r\nin regard to the history of Still River can be drawn from the angle at\r\nwhich tributaries enter it. The direction of the branches which enter\r\nat an abnormal angle can be explained without assuming a reversal of\r\nthe main stream, and likewise many of the tributaries with normal\r\ntrends seem to have adopted their courses without regard to the\r\ndirection of Still River.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. REGIONAL SLOPE NOT IN ACCORD WITH COURSE OF THE STILL\r\n\r\nAlthough the regional slope of western Connecticut as a whole is\r\ncontrary to that of Still River, there is no marked lowering of the\r\nhill summits between the source of the river and its mouth. As\r\nbranches on the south side of the Housatonic are naturally to be\r\nexpected, there is nothing unusual in the Still flowing in opposition\r\nto the regional slope, except that it flows toward the north instead\r\nof the northeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. EVIDENCE OF GLACIAL FILLING AND DEGRADING OF THE RIVER BED\r\n\r\nHobbs has suggested that the waters of the Housatonic may have been\r\nponded at a point near West Redding until they rose high enough to\r\noverflow into the \"fault gorge\" below Still River Station, thus giving\r\nthe streams of the Danbury region an outlet to the Sound by this\r\nroute. This hypothesis calls for a glacial dam which has not been\r\nfound. It is true there are glacial deposits in the Umpog valley south\r\nof Bethel. The Umpog flows as it does, however, not because of a\r\nglacial \"dam\" but in spite of it. The river heads on rock beyond and\r\nabove the glacial deposits and picks its way through them (fig. 7).\r\nDrift forms the divide at the western end of Still River valley beyond\r\nMill Plain, but the ponded water which it caused did not extend as far\r\nas Danbury (see discussion of Still-Croton valley). The Sugar Hollow\r\npass is also filled with a heavy mantle of drift, but the valley is\r\nboth too high and too narrow at the col to have been the outlet of the\r\nHousatonic.\r\n\r\nIt might be assumed that just previous to the advent of the ice sheet\r\nStill River headed south of its present mouth and flowed southward. In\r\nthis case the Still, when reversed, should have overflowed at the\r\nlowest point on the divide between it and the Housatonic. It should\r\nhave deepened its channel over the former divide, and the result would\r\nhave been a gorge if the divide were high, or at least some evidence\r\nof river cutting even if the divide were low. On the contrary, Still\r\nRiver joins the Housatonic in a low, broad, and poorly drained plain.\r\n\r\nThe existing relief is due to the uneven distribution of drift. The\r\nriver is now cutting a gorge at Lanesville, but the appearance of the\r\nvalley to the west indicates that glacial deposits forced the river\r\nout of its former bed (fig. 6) and that no barrier lay between the\r\npreglacial Still River valley and the Housatonic Valley.\r\n\r\n5. GLACIAL SCOURING\r\n\r\nA reversal of Still River may be explained by glacial scouring which\r\ncaused the northern end of the valley to become lower than the present\r\ndivides at West Redding and Mill Plain. The evidence of such scour\r\nshould be an overdeepened, U-shaped main valley and ungraded\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of Still River valley has not the typical U form\r\nwhich results from glacial erosion. As contrasted with the U-shaped\r\nglacial valley and the V-shaped valley of normal stream erosion, it\r\nmight be called rectangular so sharply does the flat valley floor\r\nterminate against the steep hillsides. The floor is too smooth and\r\nflat and the tributary valleys too closely adjusted to the variant\r\nhardness of the rocks to be the work of such a rough instrument as the\r\nglacier. A level so nearly perfect as that of the flood plain is the\r\nnatural result of erosion of soft rock down to a baselevel, whereas\r\nglacial scouring tends to produce a surface with low rounded hills and\r\nhollows.\r\n\r\nOverdeepening would be expected, because glaciers erode without\r\nreference to existing baselevels. That a river valley should be cut\r\nout by ice just enough to leave it graded with respect to the main\r\nvalley would be an unusual coincidence. This is what is found where\r\nthe Still River valley joins the Housatonic, and it indicates normal\r\nstream erosion. Also, if the limestone of the northern Still River\r\nvalley were gouged out by the glacier, the action would in all\r\nprobability have been continuous in the limestone belt to the north\r\nof the Housatonic, and where the belt of soft rock crosses the\r\nHousatonic the river bed would be overdeepened. Although the valley of\r\nthe Housatonic near New Milford is very flat, as is natural where a\r\nriver crosses a belt of weak rock, the outcrops are sufficiently\r\nnumerous to show that it has not been overdeepened. The limestone area\r\nalong the East Aspetuck is largely overlain by till, but here again\r\nthe presence of rock in place shows that the valley has not been\r\noverdeepened. Moreover, limestone boulders in the southern part of\r\nStill River valley are not as abundant as they should be under the\r\nhypothesis that the northern part had been gouged out extensively.\r\n\r\nThat the northern part of the Still River valley was not deeply\r\ncarved by ice is shown also by the character of the tributary streams.\r\nThe three small brooks on the west side of the valley, near Beaver\r\nBrook Mountain, were examined to see if their grades indicated an\r\nover-deepening of the main valley. These streams, however, and others\r\nso far as could be determined, were found to have normal profiles;\r\nthat is, their grades become increasingly flatter toward their mouths.\r\nThe streams are cutting through the till cover and are not building\r\nalluvial cones where they join the lowland. All their features, in\r\nfact, are characteristic of normal stream development.\r\n\r\nThroughout the length of the valley, rock outcrops are found near the\r\nsurface, showing that the changes produced by the glacier were due to\r\nscouring rather than to the accumulation of glacial material. Except\r\nwhere stratified drift is collected locally in considerable quantity,\r\nthe glacial mantle is thin. On the other hand, it has been shown that\r\nglacial gouging was not sufficient in amount to affect the course of\r\nthe stream. The glacier simply cleaned off the soil and rotten rock\r\nfrom the surface, slackening the stream here and hastening it there,\r\nand by blocking the course with drift it forced the river at several\r\nplaces to depart slightly from its preglacial course.\r\n\r\nThe evidence shows, therefore, that if Still River has suffered\r\nreversal, glaciation is not responsible for the change, and thus the\r\nfirst two hypotheses for explaining the history of the valley are\r\neliminated. There remain for discussion the third and fourth\r\nhypotheses; the former being that reversal was effected in a very\r\nearly stage in the development of the drainage, the latter that no\r\nreversal has occurred. The choice between these two hypotheses rests\r\non evidence obtained in the Umpog, Croton, and other valleys of the\r\nDanbury region. This evidence is presented in the three following\r\nsections, after which the former courses of Still River will be\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STILL-SAUGATUCK DIVIDE\r\n\r\nFEATURES OF THE UMPOG VALLEY\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Umpog, which extends from Still River to the source\r\nof the Saugatuck near West Redding (fig. 7), is a critical area in the\r\nstudy of the Still River system. It is possible that this valley once\r\nafforded an outlet for Still River, and it has been suggested that the\r\nHousatonic formerly followed this route to Long Island Sound. The\r\nrelation of this valley to the former drainage system of the Danbury\r\nregion demands, therefore, a careful examination of the features of\r\nthe valleys occupied by Umpog Creek and the upper waters of the\r\nSaugatuck, and of the divide between those streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 7.~ Map of Umpog Swamp and vicinity.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth of Bethel the Umpog occupies an open valley developed in\r\nlimestone. Knolls of limestone rise to heights of about 40 feet above\r\nthe floor of the valley and their upper surfaces are cut across the\r\nhighly, tilted beds. This truncation, together with a general\r\ncorrespondence in height, suggests that these knolls, as well as the\r\nrock terraces found between Bethel and West Redding, and the limestone\r\nridge which forms the divide itself, are portions of what was once a\r\nmore continuous terrace produced by stream erosion and that they\r\ndetermine a former river level. The absence of accurate elevations and\r\nthe probability of glacial scour make conclusions regarding the\r\ndirection of slope of this dissected rock terrace somewhat uncertain.\r\nAs will be indicated later, however, it seems likely that these\r\nterrace remnants mark the course of a southward flowing river that\r\nexisted in a very early stage in the development of the drainage.\r\n\r\nSouth of Bethel the old Umpog valley, has lost from one-third to\r\none-half its width through deposits of stratified drift (Pl. II, A and\r\nB). On the west, gravel beds lie against rock and till; on the east,\r\ndeposits of sand and coarse gravel form a bench or terrace from 500 to\r\n700 feet broad, which after following the side of the valley for\r\none-half mile, crosses it diagonally and joins the western slope as a\r\nrow of rounded hills. Through this drift the present stream has cut a\r\nnarrow channel.\r\n\r\nThe narrowest part of the Umpog valley is about one mile south of\r\nBethel. Farther upstream the valley expands into the flat occupied by\r\nUmpog Swamp, which presents several interesting features. The eastern,\r\nsouthern, and western sides of the swamp are formed of irregular\r\nmasses of limestone and granite-gneiss 20 to 60 feet high. Near the\r\nnorthwestern edge of the swamp is a terrace-like surface cut on\r\nlimestone. Its elevation is about the same as that of the beveled rock\r\nremnants lying in Umpog valley north of Bethel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~State Geol. Nat. Hist. Survey. Bull. 30. Plate II.~\r\n   A. View up the valley of Umpog Creek. The valley dwindles in the\r\n      distance to the \"railroad divide.\" In the middle distance is\r\n      Umpog Swamp; in the foreground the edge of the southern end of\r\n      row of Kames which points down the valley.\r\n\r\n   B.

Profile of preglacial Umpog-Still River.\r\n          Solid lines show the present levels.\r\n          Dotted lines show preglacial levels.]\r\n\r\nUmpog Swamp was formerly a lake but is now nearly filled with organic\r\nmatter so that only a small remnant of the old water body remains.\r\nSoundings have revealed no bottom at 43 feet[10] and the depth to rock\r\nbottom is not less than 45 feet. The swamp situated one-half mile\r\nsouthwest of Bethel has a depth to rock of 35 feet. In their relation\r\nto the Still River system these two swamps may be regarded simply as\r\nextensions of the Umpog Creek channel, but when the elevations of\r\ntheir bottoms are compared with that of points to the north and south,\r\nwhere the river flows on rock, it will be seen that a profile results\r\nwhich is entirely out of harmony with the present profile of the\r\nriver. Thus Umpog Creek falls 40 feet at the point where it spills\r\nover the rock ledge into the swamp, and if the 45 feet which measures\r\nthe depth of Umpog Swamp be added, the difference in level is seen to\r\nbe at least 85 feet. A similar calculation locates the bottom of the\r\nsmaller swamp near Bethel at an elevation of 340 feet above sea-level\r\nor on the same level as the bottom of Umpog Swamp. In a straight line\r\n2-1/4 miles north of Bethel, Still River crosses rock at a level of\r\n350 feet, or 10 feet higher than the bottom of Umpog Swamp. At\r\nBrookfield, 6-1/2 miles north of the mouth of the Umpog, the Still\r\ncrosses rock at 260 feet, and 4-1/2 miles farther north, it joins the\r\nHousatonic on a rock floor 200 feet above sea-level (fig. 8, A). Such\r\na profile can be explained in either of two ways: glaciers gouged out\r\nrock basins in the weak limestone, or the river in its lower part has\r\nbeen forced out of its graded bed onto rock at a higher level.\r\nProbably both causes have operated, but the latter has produced more\r\nmarked effects.\r\n\r\nUmpog Creek has its source in a small forked stream which rises in the\r\ngranite hills east of the south end of Umpog Swamp. After passing\r\nwestward through a flat swampy area, where it is joined by the waters\r\nfrom Todd Pond, the stream turns north and follows a shallow rock\r\ngorge until Umpog Swamp is reached. The divide which separates the\r\npresent headwaters of the Umpog from those of the Saugatuck is a\r\ntill-covered swampy flat about one-quarter mile east of Todd Pond.\r\nThis arrangement of tributary streams is correctly shown in fig. 7 and\r\ndiffers essentially from that shown on the Danbury atlas sheet. This\r\ndivide owes its position to the effects of glaciation. Deposits of\r\ntill and the scouring of the bed rock so modified the preglacial\r\nsurface that the upper part of the Saugatuck was cut off and made\r\ntributary to the Umpog.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Report by T. T. Giffen, 1907.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PREGLACIAL DIVIDE\r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether Still River flowed southward through the\r\nSaugatuck Valley just before the advent of the ice sheet, the borders\r\nof Umpog Swamp and the region to the south and east were examined. It\r\nwas found that Umpog Swamp is walled in on the south by ledges of firm\r\ncrystalline limestone and that the rock-floored ravine leading\r\nsouthward from the swamp, and occupied by the railroad, lies at too\r\nhigh an elevation to have been the channel of a through-flowing\r\nstream. A south-flowing Still River, and much less an ancient\r\nHousatonic, could not have had its course through this ravine just\r\nprevious to glaciation. A course for these rivers through the short\r\nvalley which extends southeastward from Umpog Swamp is also ruled out,\r\nbecause the bedrock floor of this hypothetical passageway is 20 feet\r\nhigher than the floor of the ravine through which the railroad passes.\r\n\r\nThe eastern border of Umpog Swamp is determined by a ridge of\r\nlimestone which separates the swamp from lowlying land beyond. This\r\nridge is continuous, except for the postglacial gorge cut by the\r\ntributary entering from the east, and must have been in existence in\r\npreglacial times. The entire lowland east of this limestone ridge\r\npossesses a unity that is not in harmony with the present division of\r\nthe drainage. The streams from this hillside and those from the west\r\nmay have joined in the flat-floored valley at the head of the\r\nSaugatuck and from there flowed into the Saugatuck system. The former\r\ndivide then lay in a line connecting the limestone rim of the swamp\r\nwith the tongue of highland which the highway crosses south of Todd\r\nPond (fig. 7).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STILL-CROTON DIVIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe deep valley extending from the Danbury Fair Grounds to the East\r\nBranch Reservoir in the Croton River system, has given rise to the\r\nsuggestion that the course of the Housatonic formerly may have been\r\nalong the line of Still and Croton rivers and thence to the\r\nHudson.[11] From the evidence of the topographic map alone, this\r\nhypothesis appears improbable. The trend of the larger streams in\r\nwestern Connecticut is to the south and southeast; a southwesterly\r\ncourse, therefore, would be out of harmony with the prevailing\r\ndirection of drainage. Also, the distance from the present mouth of\r\nStill River to tidewater by the Still-Croton route is longer than\r\nthe present route by way of the Housatonic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Hobbs, W. H., Still rivers of western Connecticut: Bull.\r\n   Geol. Soc. Am., vol. 13, p. 25, 1901.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES OF STILL RIVER VALLEY WEST OF DANBURY\r\n\r\nFrom Danbury to its source Still River occupies a valley whose\r\nfeatures are significant in the history of the drainage. Between\r\nDanbury and the Fair Grounds (fig. 1) the valley is a V-shaped ravine\r\n1-1/2 miles long, well proportioned to the small stream now occupying\r\nit but entirely too narrow for the channel of a large river. Along the\r\nvalley are outcrops of schist, and granite rock is present on both\r\nsides of the valley for a distance of about one-quarter mile. Part of\r\nthe valley is a mere cleft cut in the rock and is unglaciated. At the\r\nDanbury Fair Grounds the valley opens out into a marshy plain, through\r\nwhich the river meanders and receives two tributaries from the south.\r\nThe plain, which extends beyond Lake Kanosha on the west, has a\r\ngenerally level surface but is diversified in places by mounds of\r\nstratified drift.\r\n\r\nNear the railroad a rock outcrop was found which gives a clue to the\r\nnature of the broad lowland. The rock consists mainly of schist, but\r\non the side next the valley there is a facing of rotten limestone.\r\nThis plain, like all the others in this region, is a local peneplain\r\ndeveloped on soluble limestone. A better example could not be found to\r\nprove the fallacy of the saying that \"a broad valley proves the\r\nexistence of a large river.\" The plain is simply a local expansion of\r\na valley which on each side is much narrower. No other river than the\r\none flowing through it can have been responsible for the erosion, for\r\nthe plain is enclosed by hills of gneiss and schist (Pl. III).\r\n\r\nAt Mill Plain the valley is crowded by ragged rock outcrops which jut\r\ninto the lowland. Here the river occupies a ravine cut in till near\r\nthe north side of the valley. West of Mill Plain station the valley is\r\nencumbered with ridges of stratified drift, interspersed with heavy\r\naccumulations of till. Near Andrew Pond the true width of the\r\nvalley--one-eighth mile--is shown by rock outcrops on both the north\r\nand south slopes. The valley at this point gives no indication of\r\nnarrowing toward the headwaters; in fact, it becomes broader toward\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nBetween Andrew Pond and Haines' Pond is the divide which separates the\r\nwaters of the Still system from those of the Croton. It consists of a\r\njumbled mass of morainal hills, seemingly of boulder clay, that rise\r\nfrom 50 to 60 feet above the level of the ponds. The divide is thus\r\nmerely a local obstruction in what was formerly a through drainage\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STILL-CROTON VALLEY\r\n\r\nIt is evident that before the advent of the glacier a stream must have\r\nflowed through the Still-Croton valley past the present divide in\r\norder to have excavated the rock valley there found. The Housatonic\r\ncould not have flowed west through this valley if it was as narrow and\r\nshallow as is indicated by known rock outcrops; the river could have\r\nflowed through it only in a deep narrow gorge which was later buried\r\nunder drift, but the evidence at hand does not support this view.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~State Geol. Nat. Hist. Survey Bull. 30. Plate III.~\r\n   Limestone Plain southwest of Danbury, in which are situated the\r\n   Danbury Fair Grounds and Lake Kanosha.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that this valley was made by the preglacial\r\nCroton River. This explanation demands no change in the direction of\r\nStill and Croton Rivers but calls for a divide at some point east of\r\nthe present one. From a divide between the Fair Grounds and Danbury, a\r\nsmall stream may be supposed to have flowed toward the east, joining\r\nthe larger northern branch of the Still at a point near the middle of\r\nthe city of Danbury. The stream flowing westward from this divide\r\nformed the headwaters of one branch of the Croton system.\r\n\r\nThe presence of till in a ravine can be used as a criterion for\r\nlocating the site of a former divide, for where till is present in\r\nthe bed of a stream the channel is of preglacial date. Where the river\r\ncrosses a divide it should be cutting through rock, though till may be\r\npresent on the valley slopes. Judged by this test, the old divide was\r\nsituated either just east of the Fair Grounds plain or at the east end\r\nof the ravine described in the preceding topic. Of these two positions\r\nthe one near the Fair Grounds seems the more likely (fig. 1), for at\r\nthis place the river has excavated a recent channel with steep sides\r\nin gneissoid rock. The absence of the limestone at this point may be\r\nsufficient in itself to explain the location of the divide.\r\n\r\nExact measurements of the drift in the upper Still valley are needed\r\nin order to establish this hypothesis completely and to plot the old\r\nchannel, but the position of the rock floor of the former channel\r\nextending westward from the Fair Grounds may be fixed approximately.\r\nThe rock at the assumed divide now stands at 420 feet above sea-level\r\nand it is reasonable to assume that ten feet has been removed by\r\nglacial scouring and postglacial erosion, making the original\r\nelevation 430 feet. The present divide between Andrew Pond and Haines'\r\nPond has an elevation of 460, but the bedrock at this place is buried\r\nunder 60 feet of drift, so that the valley floor lies at 400 feet.\r\nAccording to these estimates the stream which headed east of the Fair\r\nGrounds had a fall of 30 feet before reaching the site of the present\r\nHaines' Pond (fig. 8, B).\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIAL LAKE KANOSHA\r\n\r\nWhen the Croton Branch was beheaded by drift choking up its valley\r\nwest of Andrew Pond, the ponded waters rose to a height of from 20 to\r\n30 feet and then overflowed the basin on the side toward Danbury. The\r\noutlet was established across the old divide, and as the gorge by\r\nwhich the water escaped was cut down, the level of the ponded waters\r\nwas lowered. At the same time, also, the lake was filled by debris\r\nwashed into it from the surrounding slopes. Thus the present flat\r\nplain was formed and the old valley floor, a local peneplain developed\r\non the limestone, was hidden.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVIDES IN THE HIGHLANDS SOUTH OF DANBURY\r\n\r\nThe mountain mass to the south and southwest of Danbury, including\r\nTown Hill and Spruce, Moses, and Thomas mountains, is traversed by a\r\nseries of parallel gorges trending nearly north and south (fig. 2).\r\nAbout midway in each valley is a col, separating north and\r\nsouth-flowing streams. Two of the valleys, those between Spruce and\r\nMoses mountains, and Thomas Mountain and Town Hill, form fairly low\r\nand broad passes. They were examined to see whether either could have\r\nafforded a southerly outlet for Still River.\r\n\r\nThe rock composing the mountains is granite-gneiss and schist with an\r\naverage strike of N 30 deg. W, or very nearly in line with the trend of\r\nthe valleys. The gneiss was found to be characteristic of the high\r\nridges and schist to be more common in the valleys. No outcrops of\r\nlimestone were found on the ridges, but at two or three localities\r\nlimestone in place was found on low ground. From the facts observed\r\nit is evident that the stronger features of the relief are due to the\r\npresence of bodies of resistant rock, whereas the valleys are due to\r\nthe presence of softer rock. The series of deep parallel valleys is\r\nattributed to the presence of limestone rather than schist.\r\n\r\nThe gorge between Spruce and Moses mountains, locally called \"Sugar\r\nHollow,\" narrows southward as it rises to the col, and the rock floor\r\nis buried under till and stratified drift to depths of 25 to 50 feet.\r\nNevertheless it is probable that the valley was no deeper in\r\npreglacial time than it is now. The plan of the valley with its broad\r\nmouth to the north favored glacial scour so that the ice widened and\r\ndeepened the valley and gave it a U form. Scouring and filling are\r\nbelieved to have been about equal in amount, and the present height\r\nof the divide, about 470 feet, may be taken as the preglacial\r\nelevation. This is 70 feet higher than the rock floor of the divide at\r\nWest Redding. The pass could not, therefore, have served as an outlet\r\nfor Still River.\r\n\r\nThe valley west of Town Hill is similar in form and origin to Sugar\r\nHollow. The water parting occurs in a swamp, from each end of which a\r\nsmall brook flows. The height of the pass in this valley--590 feet--\r\nprecludes its use as an ancient outlet for Still River. Likewise the\r\nvalley east of Town Hill affords no evidence of occupation by a\r\nsouthward through-flowing stream.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT STILL RIVER\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that the Still-Umpog was not reversed by a glacial dam\r\ndoes not preclude the possibility that this valley has been occupied\r\nby a south-flowing stream. It is probable that in an early stage in\r\nthe development of the drainage, the streams of the Danbury region\r\nreached Long Island Sound by way of the Still-Umpog-Saugatuck valley.\r\nAlong this route, as described under the heading \"The Still-Saugatuck\r\nDivide,\" is a fairly broad continuous valley at a higher level than\r\nthe beds of the present rivers. A south-flowing river, as shown in\r\nfig. 9, brings all the drainage between Danbury and the Housatonic\r\ninto normal relations.\r\n\r\nThis early relationship of the streams was disturbed by the reversal\r\nof the waters of the ancient Still in the natural development of a\r\nsubsequent drainage. The Housatonic lowered the northern end of the\r\nlimestone belt, in the region between New Milford and Stillriver\r\nvillage, faster than the smaller south-flowing stream was able to\r\nerode its bed. Eventually a small tributary of the Housatonic captured\r\nthe headwaters of the south-flowing river, and by the time the latter\r\nhad been reversed as far south as the present divide at Umpog Swamp,\r\nit is probable that the advantage gained by the more rapid erosion of\r\nthe Housatonic was offset by the Saugatuck's shorter course to the\r\nsea. As a result the divide between Still and Saugatuck Rivers at\r\nUmpog Swamp had become practically stationary before the advent of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\nThe complex history of Still River is not fully shown in the stream\r\nprofile, for the latter is nearly normal, except in the rock basins in\r\nthe valley of the Umpog. This is due to the fact that changes in the\r\ncourse of the Still, caused by the development of a subsequent\r\ndrainage through differential erosion, were made so long ago that\r\nevidence of them has been largely destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing conclusion practically eliminates hypothesis IV--that\r\nthe Still developed from the beginning as a subsequent stream in the\r\ndirection in which it now flows. This hypothesis holds good only for\r\nthe short portion of the lower course of the present river, that is,\r\nthe part representing the short tributary of the Housatonic which\r\ncaptured and reversed the original Still.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTURES OF STILL RIVER FROM ITS PREGLACIAL CHANNEL\r\n\r\nBetween Danbury and Beaver Brook Mountain the Still departs widely\r\nfrom its former channel, as shown in fig. 6. At the foot of Liberty\r\nStreet in Danbury the river makes a sharp turn to the southeast, flows\r\nthrough a flat plain, and for some distance follows the limestone\r\nvalley of the Umpog, meeting the latter stream in a swampy meadow. It\r\nthen cuts across the western end of Shelter Rock in a gorge-like\r\nvalley not over 200 feet wide. Outcrops of a gneissoid schist on the\r\nvalley sides and rapids in the stream bear witness to the youthfulness\r\nof this portion of the river channel.\r\n\r\nAn open valley which extends from the foot of Liberty Street in a\r\nnortheasterly direction (the railroad follows it) marks the former\r\ncourse of Still River, but after the stream was forced out of this\r\ncourse and superimposed across the end of Shelter Rock by the\r\naccumulation of drift in the central and northern parts of the valley,\r\nit was unable to regain its old channel until near Beaver Brook\r\nMountain. The deposits of drift not only have kept the Still confined\r\nto the eastern side of its valley but have forced a tributary from the\r\nwest to flow along the edge of the valley for a mile before it joins\r\nits master stream.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile north of Brookfield Junction, Still River valley begins\r\nto narrow, and at Brookfield the river, here crowded to the extreme\r\neastern side, is cutting a gorge through limestone. The preglacial\r\ncourse of the Still in the Brookfield region seems to have been near\r\nthe center of the valley where it was joined by Long Brook and other\r\nshort, direct streams draining the hillsides. The glacier, however,\r\nleft a thick blanket of drift in the middle of the valley which turned\r\nthe Still to the east over rock and forced Long Brook to flow for more\r\nthan a mile along the extreme western side of the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 9.~ Early stage of the Rocky-Still River,\r\n   antedating preglacial course shown in figure 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broad valley through which the Still flows in the lower part of\r\nits course extends northward beyond it for over two miles, bordering\r\nthe Housatonic River. At Lanesville near the mouth of the Still, the\r\nriver has cut a gorge 30 feet deep and one-quarter mile long in the\r\nlimestone. Upstream from this gorge the river meanders widely in a\r\nflat valley, whereas on the downstream side it has cut a deep channel\r\nin the drift in order to reach the level of the Housatonic. There is\r\nroom in the drift-covered plain to the west for a buried channel of\r\nStill River which could join the Housatonic at any point between New\r\nMilford and Stillriver station. If the depth of the drift be taken at\r\n25 feet, there would seem to be no objection to the supposition that\r\nthe Still initially joined its master stream opposite New Milford, as\r\nshown in fig 6. After the limestone had been worn down to approximate\r\nbaselevel, the tendency of the Still would have been to seek an outlet\r\nfarther south in order to shorten its course and reach a lower level\r\non the Housatonic. This stage in the evolution of the river may not\r\nhave been reached before the ice age, and it is thus possible that\r\nglacial deposits may have pushed the river to the extreme southern\r\nside of its valley, superimposed it over rock, and forced it to cut\r\nits way down to grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED COURSES OF HOUSATONIC RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs possible former outlets for the Housatonic, Hobbs has suggested the\r\nStill-Umpog-Saugatuck valley or the Still-Croton valley (by way of the\r\nEast Branch Reservoir)[12], whereas Crosby has suggested the Ten\r\nMile-Swamp River-Muddy Brook-Croton River valley (by way of Webatuck,\r\nWing's Station, and Pawling), or the Fall's Village-Limerock-Sharon-\r\nWebatuck Creek-Ten Mile valley.[13] The sketch map, fig. 10, indicates\r\nthe courses just outlined and one other by way of the Norwalk. The\r\nlatter is the route followed by the Danbury and Norwalk Division of the\r\nHousatonic Railroad. It is natural to assume that the Housatonic might\r\nhave occupied anyone of these lines of valleys, particularly where they\r\nare developed on limestone and seem too broad for the streams now\r\noccupying them. Nevertheless, although each of these routes is on soft\r\nrock and some give shorter distances to the sea than the present course,\r\nit is highly improbable that the Housatonic ever occupied any of these\r\nvalleys. For had the river once become located in a path of least\r\nresistance, such as is furnished by any of these suggested routes, it\r\ncould not have been dislodged and forced to cut its way for 25 miles\r\nthrough a massive granitic formation, as it does between Still River\r\nand Derby, without great difficulty (Pl. IV, A).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fig. 10.~ Five suggested outlets of Housatonic River.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the larger river systems of Connecticut shows that\r\nthe streams composing them exhibit two main trends. Likewise, the\r\ncourses, of the larger rivers themselves, whether trunk streams or\r\ntributaries, combine these two trends, one of which is\r\nnorthwest-southeast and the other nearly north-south.\r\n\r\nThe north-south drainage lines are the result of geologic structure,\r\nand many broad, flat-floored valleys, often apparently out of\r\nproportion to the streams occupying them, have this direction. On the\r\nother hand, the northwest-southeast drainage lines across the strike\r\nof formations, coincide with the slope toward the sea of the uplifted\r\npeneplain whose dissected surface is represented by the crests of the\r\nuplands. The valleys of streams with this trend are generally narrow,\r\nand some are gorges where resistant rock masses are crossed. The\r\nnorthwest-southeast trends of master streams thus were determined\r\ninitially by the slope of the peneplain, whereas the north-south\r\ntrends represent later adjustments to structure.\r\n\r\nIt is concluded, therefore, that the Housatonic between Bulls' Bridge\r\nand Derby (fig. 10), had its course determined by the slope of the\r\nuplifted peneplain and is antecedent in origin. The old headwaters\r\nextended northwest from the turn in the river near Bull's Bridge,\r\nwhereas that part of the river above Bull's Bridge was initially a\r\nminor tributary. This tributary, because of its favorable situation,\r\nin time captured all the drainage of the extensive limestone belt to\r\nthe north and then became part of the main stream. The lower\r\nHousatonic, therefore, has always maintained its ancient course\r\ndiagonal to the strike of formations, and differential erosion, which\r\nreaches its maximum expression in limestone areas, is responsible for\r\nthe impression that the Still River lowland and other valleys west of\r\nthe Housatonic may once have been occupied by the latter stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~State Geol.

When\r\nthe glacier came it hampered the drainage by scooping out the rock\r\nbottom of the valley in places and by dropping deposits at the mouth\r\nof Beaver Brook valley, thus forming Beaver Brook Swamp or \"The Flat,\"\r\nas it is called (fig. 6).\r\n\r\nAmong the deposits at the southern end of Beaver Brook Swamp is\r\nconsiderable stratified drift in the form of smoothly rounded hills or\r\nkames, which are situated both on the border of the valley and in the\r\nswamp. Till containing medium-sized boulders of granodiorite-gneiss\r\noccurs along the road which borders the east side of the densely\r\nwooded swamp.\r\n\r\nAlong the northeastern border of the swamp is a flat-topped terrace of\r\ntill, perhaps a lateral moraine, through which a small stream heading\r\nto the north has cut a V-shaped ravine. A lobe of fine till extends\r\ninto the valley from the northeast and narrows the outlet.\r\n\r\nBetween the railroad and highway, which cross the northern end of the\r\nswamp, is an irregular wooded eminence of rock, partly concealed by a\r\nveneer of drift. Between this knoll and Shelter Rock are heavy\r\ndeposits of sand in the form of a short, broad terrace with lobes\r\nwhich point into the Still River valley. A similar terrace is found to\r\nthe northwest on the opposite side of the valley.\r\n\r\nAt the northern end of Shelter Rock along the blind road leading to\r\nthe summit is a peninsula-like body of drift which contains huge\r\ngranite boulders mixed here and there with pockets of sand and gravel.\r\nStratified drift was found at the foot of the hill, and till overlying\r\nit higher up. The more usual arrangement is boulder clay overlain by\r\nmodified drift, the first being laid down by the ice itself, the\r\nsecond being deposited by streams from the melting glacier in its\r\nretreat. Huge boulders, many ten feet or more in diameter, are strewn\r\nover the northern slope of Shelter Rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITS NORTHEAST OF DANBURY\r\n\r\nNorth of the railroad, opposite Shelter Rock (fig. 6), is a most\r\ninteresting flat-topped ridge of drift which topographically is an\r\nextension of the higher rock mass to the northwest. In this drift mass\r\nare to be found in miniature a number of the forms characteristic of\r\nglacial topography. The broad-topped gravel ridge slopes sharply on\r\nthe north into a flat-bottomed ravine which is evidently part of the\r\nStill River lowland. This portion of the valley has been shut off by\r\ndrift deposits. The drainage has been so obstructed that the stream in\r\nthe ravine turns northeast away from its natural outlet. In the valley\r\nof \"X\" brook (fig. 1) are terraces, esker-like lobes, and detached\r\nmounds of stratified drift resting on a foundation of till.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern border of the hill is to be seen the contact between\r\ntwo forms of glacial deposits (Pl. IV, B). A mass of stratified drift\r\noverlies a hummocky deposit of coarse till, but large boulders\r\noccurring here and there on top of the stratified drift show that the\r\nice-laid and water-laid materials were not completely sorted. Boulders\r\nseem to have been dropping out of the ice at the same time that gravel\r\nwas being deposited. Boulders of granite-gneiss eight feet or more in\r\ndiameter, carried by the ice from the hills to the north and\r\nnortheast, are strewn at the foot of the hill.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITS BETWEEN BEAVER BROOK MOUNTAIN AND MOUTH OF STILL RIVER\r\n\r\nAbout a mile beyond Beaver Brook Mountain, the railroad cuts through\r\nthe edge of a hill 80 feet in height exposing a section consisting of\r\ndistinctly stratified layers of fine white quartz sand, coarser\r\nyellowish sand, and small round pebbles. The quartz sand was used at\r\none time in making glass. Farther east where the two tracks of the New\r\nYork and New England railroads converge, a cut shows a section of at\r\nleast 40 feet of boulder clay. Near the river, limestone boulders are\r\ncommon, indicating that the valley to the north was degraded to some\r\nextent by the glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~State Geol. Nat. Hist. Survey Bull. 30. Plate V.~\r\n   A. Kames in Still River Valley west of Brookfield Junction.\r\n   B. Till ridges on the western border of Still River Valley, south\r\n      of Brookfield.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the valley at Brookfield Junction and on its western side, are\r\nthick deposits of clean sand. One mile north of Brookfield Junction,\r\nalong the western border of the valley, an esker follows an irregular\r\ncourse for several hundred yards approximately parallel to the river\r\nand terminates at its southern end in a group of kames (Pl. V, A and\r\nB). Opposite the point where these accumulations occur, is a\r\nterrace-like deposit of till. Between the gorge at Brookfield and the\r\nmouth of Still River, swampy areas, flat meadows, and small hills of\r\ndrift occur.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the Still River lowland, the flat land east of\r\nGreen Mountain may be called a plateau. The step between the two is\r\nmade by an east-facing rocky slope, the outline of which has been\r\nsoftened by a lateral moraine separated from the plateau edge by a\r\nsmall ravine. On the lowland below the moraine is a group of kames.\r\nNear Lanesville (fig. 6), are thick deposits of water-laid material,\r\nincluding a hill of gravel near the river having a large bowl-shaped\r\ndepression on one side formed by the melting of an ice block. Two and\r\na half miles south of Lanesville on the west side of the lowland, a\r\nwooded esker extends for about one-quarter mile parallel to the valley\r\naxis and then merges into the rocky hillside.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKES\r\n\r\nThe lakes of this region are of two kinds: (1) those due to the\r\ndamming of river valleys by glacial deposits and (2) rock basins\r\ngouged out by the ice.\r\n\r\nAmong the lakes which owe their origin to drift accumulations in the\r\nvalleys are Andrew and Haines' ponds at the head of Still River. These\r\nare properly parts of the Croton River system, but Andrew Pond has\r\nbeen held back by the deep filling of boulder clay in the valley. Lake\r\nKanosha, in the same valley, is a shallow lake formed in the drift.\r\nThe lake south of Spruce Mountain at the head of the Saugatuck seems\r\nto be enclosed by drift alone.\r\n\r\nNeversink Pond, Barses Pond, Creek Pond, and Leonard Pond are the\r\nremnants of larger water bodies now converted into swamps. Squantz\r\nPond and Hatch Pond have dams of drift. Eureka Lake and East Lake\r\nappear to be rock basins whose levels have been raised somewhat by\r\ndams of till. Great Mountain Pond and Green's Pond, between Great\r\nMountain and Green Mountain, are surrounded by rock and their level\r\nhas been raised several feet by artificial dams. Great Mountain Pond\r\nis at least 50 feet above the level of Green Pond and separated from\r\nit by a rock ridge (fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE GLACIAL DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nA tongue of the glacier is supposed to have lain in the valley of the\r\nUmpog and gradually retreated northward after the ice had disappeared\r\nfrom the uplands on either side. The ridge of intermediate height\r\nbuilt of limestone and schist, which extends down the middle of the\r\nvalley, was probably covered by ice for some time after the glacier\r\nhad left the highlands.\r\n\r\nWhen the mountain mass extending from Pine Mountain to Town Hill west\r\nof the Umpog Basin and the granite hills to the east terminating in\r\nShelter Rock are considered in their relation to the movement of the\r\nice, it is apparent that the valley of the Umpog must have been the\r\nmost direct and lowest outlet for glacial streams south of Danbury.\r\nThese streams built up the terraces and other deposits of stratified\r\ndrift which occupy the valley between Bethel and West Redding.\r\n\r\nThe heavy deposits of till near West Redding mark a halt in the\r\nretreating glacier. The boulders at this point are large and numerous,\r\nand kames and gravel ridges were formed. The deposits at the divide,\r\nsupposed to have formed a glacial dam which reversed the Umpog,[14]\r\nare much less heavy than at points short distances north and south of\r\nthe water parting.\r\n\r\nAs the ice retreated, sand and gravel in the form of terraces\r\naccumulated along the margin of the Umpog valley, where the drainage\r\nwas concentrated in the spaces left by the melting of the ice lobe\r\nfrom the hillside. Among these deposits are the bodies of sand and\r\ngravel which lie against the rocky hillslopes most of the way from the\r\nUmpog-Saugatuck divide to Bethel. North of Bethel, the drainage seems\r\nto have been gathered chiefly in streams flowing on each side of the\r\nlow ridge occupying the center of the valley; consequently the gravel\r\nwas deposited along the sides and southern end of the ridge and in the\r\nsag which cuts across its northern end. The row of kames at the north\r\nend of Umpog Swamp, several knolls of drift in Bethel, and the\r\nkame-like deposits and esker north of Grassy Plain were laid down\r\nsuccessively as the ice retreated down the valley. During this period,\r\nthe drainage was ponded between the ice front and the Umpog-Saugatuck\r\ndivide.\r\n\r\nUncovering the Still-Croton valley did not give the glacial drainage\r\nany lower outlet than the Umpog-Saugatuck divide afforded (fig. 8, B\r\nand C.)\r\n\r\nThe heavy deposits of boulder clay forming the moraine which blocks\r\nthe Rocky River valley indicate the next halting place of the glacier.\r\nIn this period the ice margin formed an irregular northeast-southwest\r\nline about a mile north of Danbury. The country west and south of\r\nDanbury was thus uncovered, but the lower part of Still River valley\r\nwas either covered by the ice sheet or occupied by an ice lobe. The\r\ndrainage was, therefore, up the river valley, and being concentrated\r\nalong the valley sides resulted in the accumulation of sand and gravel\r\nat the foot of rocky slopes. It is possible that an ice lobe extended\r\ndown the old Rocky River valley, perhaps occupying much of the country\r\nbetween Beaver Brook Mountain and the high ridge west of the valley.\r\nThe streams issuing from this part of the ice front would have laid\r\ndown the eskers and kame gravels north of Danbury and the thick mantle\r\nof drift over which Still River flows through the city. As would be\r\nexpected, this accumulation of material ponded all the north-flowing\r\nstreams--Umpog Creek, Beaver Brook, and smaller nameless ones--and at\r\nthe same time pushed Still River, at its mouth, to the southern side\r\nof its valley. Beaver Brook valley, Umpog valley, and all the Danbury\r\nbasin must have been flooded during this period up to the height of\r\nthe \"railroad divide.\" Within the area covered by the city, the valley\r\nwas filled up to at least 70 feet and probably much more than that\r\nabove its former level. Flowing at this higher level, the river was\r\nthrown out of its course and here and there superimposed on hard\r\nrock--as, for example, at Shelter Rock.\r\n\r\nThat part of the drainage coming down the valley opposite Beaver Brook\r\nmet the drainage from Still River ice lobe in the valley north of\r\nShelter Rock, and as a result heavy deposits of stratified drift were\r\nlaid down. The peninsula-like mass of drift beyond the river north of\r\nShelter Rock appears from its form to have been built up as the delta\r\nof southward and eastward-flowing streams; probably the drainage from\r\nthe hilltops united with streams coming down the two valleys. The\r\nlobes of stratified drift extending from the ridge may have been built\r\nfirst, and later the connecting ridge of gravel which forms the top of\r\nthe hill may have accumulated as additional material was washed in,\r\ntying together the ridges of gravel along their western ends. The\r\nmingling in this region of stratified drift of all grades of\r\ncoarseness indicates the union in the same basin of debris gathered\r\nfrom several sources.\r\n\r\nBetween Danbury and New Milford no moraine crosses either the Rocky or\r\nthe Still valley, but the abundance of till which overspreads the\r\nwhole country indicates a slowly retreating glacier well loaded with\r\nrock debris. The mounds of stratified drift scattered along the valley\r\ndoubtless represent the deltas of streams issuing from the ice front.\r\nThe waters of Rocky River were ponded until the outlet near Jerusalem\r\nwas uncovered and the disappearance of ice from the ravine below\r\nallowed an escape to the Housatonic. Stratified drift is present in\r\ngreatest amount along the valleys of Still River and the west fork of\r\nRocky River, indicating that these were the two chief lines of\r\ndrainage. The uplands are practically without stratified drift.\r\n\r\nAlong the valley of the Housatonic, glacial material is chiefly in the\r\nform of gravel terraces; they extend from Gaylordsville to New\r\nMilford, in some places on one side only, in others on both sides of\r\nthe river. Part of these gravel benches are kame terraces, as shown by\r\ntheir rolling tops and the ravine which separates the terrace from the\r\nhillside; others may have been made by the river cutting through the\r\nmantle of drift which was laid down in the period of land depression\r\nat the time of glacial retreat,[15] or they may be a combination of the\r\ntwo forms. In many places by swinging in its flood plain, the river\r\nhas cut into the terraces and left steep bluffs of gravel. The valley\r\nof Womenshenuck Brook above Merwinsville contains heavy deposits of\r\nstratified drift, indicating that this broad valley which extends from\r\nKent on the Housatonic to Merwinsville was an important channel for\r\nthe water which flowed from the melting ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Rice, W.
