  "content": "RAW MEN\r\n\r\nBy Frank Richardson Pierce\r\n\r\n    Self-preservation is not the first law of Nature, according\r\n    to Mr. Pierce, who knows the Arctic at first hand and who\r\n    offers this fine story in support of his contention.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blue-eyed Swede spoke briefly in dialect to the greasy Eskimo. The\r\nlatter peered ahead where the inexorable drift of the ice-pack was\r\nslowly wiping out the blue lead. The trading schooner was drab,\r\nice-battered and unromantic, but her holds carried a fortune in furs.\r\nThe shore was dangerously close, piled high with shattered bergs where\r\nthe pack had grounded. Little short of a granite mountain could\r\nwithstand the grinding pressure of the pack, and even granite had been\r\nscoured away so that in summer the cliffs were overhanging the sea in\r\nspots. The man-made thing of planks, cordage and paint was less than an\r\neggshell when pitted against the floes; and so the Eskimo considered\r\nmany things before he spoke--then he grunted in dialect. He showed no\r\nfear, nor did the Swede who peered from his frosted parka hood and\r\ngripped the spokes of the wheel with mitted hands.\r\n\r\nAll others were below except one. He seemed detached from the scheme of\r\nthings. He neither gave orders nor obeyed them, but stood forward, with\r\nfeet apart--a big, handsome man with more than a trace of character and\r\nrefinement in his face. He cursed, not the floes nor the sluggish\r\nprogress of the schooner, but his father. His eyes blazed with the fires\r\nof resentment in the same fury of three months ago. The last words of\r\nhis father were still ringing in his ears: “You’re a selfish young pup.\r\nYou’ve failed as a son; you’re failing as a man. That means I’ve failed\r\nas a father. I’d rather have succeeded as a father than as a business\r\nman. I can’t learn you nothing; maybe if you rub shoulders with life\r\nyou’ll learn something. I wanted to make your row easier to hoe than\r\nmine was. I made it easy, and that’s my mistake. I tried to get under\r\nyour skin, but never could make it, so we’ve hated each other at times.\r\nThat’s bad business for both father and son--to hate. It’s the father’s\r\nfault. He’s failed some way. My lack of education--and what you once\r\ncalled ‘a lack of appreciation of the finer things in life’--rubbed you\r\nthe wrong way. I’m sorry, but I can’t help it.... I gave you the wrong\r\ncourse; the craft was wrecked. I’m trying to salvage enough from the\r\nwreckage to build a new vessel.... Bear a hand--wont you, son?”\r\n\r\nBusiness men’s associations, chambers of commerce, people who had done\r\nthings, were glad to “learn something” from old Walton, but his son was\r\nnot. Because he did not know there had been a wreck, he had not offered\r\nto lend a hand in his salvaging. Rather he regarded himself as a fine,\r\ntrim craft steaming through the murky waters of his father’s\r\nassociation. In a word he was something of a fool. There had been no\r\nscene, though the elder Walton could raise his voice loud enough when he\r\nwas aroused. Dick Walton did not believe in lifting his voice in anger,\r\nand so his attitude had been dignified, well-bred silence.\r\n\r\nThe rest had been simple. He had been sent aboard Hanson’s schooner with\r\ncertain papers; Hanson had glanced through them, made a face, cursed\r\ninwardly and shoved off on the Arctic trading expedition. Dick had the\r\nchoice of going along or jumping overboard. Hanson told him he did not\r\ncare which course he followed.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalton ignored the danger on every side as he watched the schooner’s\r\nprogress. It was Hanson’s business to get her through the floes and into\r\nopen water. Walton reflected bitterly instead of lending a hand. “Crazy\r\nideas, the old man has. What can a Swede with washed-out blue eyes, or a\r\nfilthy, greasy Eskimo, teach a college-bred gentleman? They are of the\r\nold man’s school; mine is different. We show the stamp of our respective\r\nschools.” He was silent a moment, regarding the Swede and Eskimo.\r\n“Wonder how Mother ever came to marry the old man? She has refinement,\r\nbackground, everything, while Father--all right enough in a\r\nrough-and-tumble brawl, but--”\r\n\r\nA sudden shock threw Walton to the deck. The schooner’s bow leaped\r\nupward with a terrible grinding of ice against the armor of iron.\r\nShattered bergs spumed up from the boiling sea as the schooner hurdled\r\nthe barrier into the lead beyond. The engines stopped racing; once more\r\nthe craft forged ahead.\r\n\r\n“Consider,” he said to himself, “the Eskimo. He is greasy, filthy,\r\ndrinks ripe seal-oil--and I have seen him eat clams from the stomach of\r\na walrus. His code crushes the weak; self-preservation is the first law\r\nof nature, but it is ten thousand years removed from mine. He should be\r\ncivilized and no mistake, but the fact remains he is a savage. What can\r\nhe teach me? Nothing, unless I wish to drink seal-oil.\r\n\r\n“Consider that Hanson! Colorless, silent, a bohunk from which an\r\neducated man can learn nothing, unless he wishes to sail a schooner or\r\nscrub decks.”\r\n\r\nOne by one he considered the men with whom he had rubbed shoulders the\r\npast few months. Queer creatures, all--even the little old Dutchman who\r\nspent his life in the engine-room, where the air was always blue and\r\nfoul from burning oil. The engines seemed eternally on the verge of\r\nfalling apart, but by merely a laying-on of hands, old Schwartz always\r\ncontrived to make them respond in the pinch. Of course if one wished to\r\nbecome an engineer--\r\n\r\nWalton never entered the engine-room. It was too dirty, greasy and\r\npractical. The Eskimo spent hours there. Below were stowed baled furs\r\nnow pleasing neither to nostrils or eyes, but which eventually were to\r\nknow the rarest of perfumes and grace the shoulders of soft and lovely\r\nwomen. Walton groped about mentally seeking a lesson in transition, some\r\ncomparison between raw furs and raw men. There was none. The furs could\r\nrise to great heights. They began on the backs of slinking wild\r\ncreatures, and ended with God’s greatest creation--woman. But the men\r\nwere plodders, born to their lot, wresting from life whatever they could\r\nwith bare hands, never to rise above themselves. It was unfortunate, but\r\nit was life.\r\n\r\nLeft to his reflections, Walton might have plucked from the cold Arctic\r\nair a line of philosophy that would have gone down in history as a\r\nclassic. He was groping for it, when the greatest crash of all again\r\nsent him to the deck. The schooner trembled and crumpled from the mortal\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nWalton fought and clawed his way from the wreckage to the floe. There\r\nwere men below in the fo’c’stle, but they died silently. The blue-eyed\r\nSwede burst from the wheelhouse and tore the covering from the narrow,\r\nsquarish opening leading down to the engine-room. Old Schwartz was down\r\nthere with his rheumatism, stiff-legged, unable to climb a ladder. A bit\r\nof blue haze came from below as the Swede disappeared; the screaming of\r\nthe splintering schooner was like some living thing dying in agony. The\r\ngreasy silken cap worn by the engineer protruded just above the hatch an\r\ninstant as if he were being lifted from below, then disappeared. No cry\r\ncame from the hatch as the craft went under--just a final puff of blue\r\nsmoke. The old Dutchman and the colorless Swede died in silence--men of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nShattered bits of wood amid shattered ice was all that remained of the\r\nschooner. The food, shelter and warmth that had been Walton’s a few\r\nminutes before, had vanished: he stood on the ice unarmed, without food.\r\nStrange words came from behind him, startling him into the realization\r\nthat he was not alone. The greasy Eskimo stood there, muttering in\r\ndialect. His words, “Men die and you live,” meant nothing to Walton, but\r\nthe glitter in the native’s dark eyes placed him on the defensive. Then\r\nhe laughed at his fears as the Eskimo’s thin frame was racked with a\r\ncough. No danger there; if they reverted to the primitive he could tear\r\nthe miserable wretch apart. Again the Eskimo repeated: “Men die and you\r\nlive.”\r\n\r\nAt the native’s feet lay a section of walrus-skin, sufficient to wrap\r\none man warmly. In his arms he held a skin filled with seal-oil--rancid\r\nstuff that would sicken a white man, though an Eskimo could live on it\r\nfor a time. An ivory-headed spear was slung across his shoulders, and\r\nsomewhere beneath his parka he carried a knife. Against this was\r\nWalton’s pocketknife and his youth. Which would survive? Walton knew the\r\nanswer: neither! But one would go like a savage, and the other would go\r\nlike a civilized man. He resolved he would remain true to his teachings,\r\nhis code, and not become a beastly savage.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo wasted no time in sorrowful reflection, but started over the\r\nice, hugging the sealskin bag to his breast, dragging the walrus-hide\r\nbehind him. Dick followed. In the past few minutes he had experienced a\r\nchange. He had seen raw men rise to great heights of courage, and die in\r\nsilent bravery. The colorless Swede could have saved himself, throttled\r\nthe Eskimo with his bare hands and taken the skin of oil, the\r\nwalrus-hide and the spear, and with them food, warmth and protection.\r\nWith the spear or without it, he could have beaten Walton to his knees,\r\nfor he was a physical giant. Instead, he had given his life for another;\r\nand greater heights no man can attain. Before him Walton bowed in humble\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nIn the slow progress over the floe, Walton again reflected on the\r\ndifferent codes of the two survivors. The code of Dick Walton protected\r\nand cared for the aged. The primal code of the Eskimo was\r\nself-preservation--the first law of Nature. Like the majority of\r\ncivilized people, Walton did not know of the strange code more ancient\r\nthan that of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nAlone, Walton would have fought his way to the ice-armored shore. The\r\nEskimo ignored it and crossed the floe. As aboard the schooner, he\r\nconsidered many things--then leaped to a small berg. Unconsciously\r\nWalton found himself considering the skin of seal-oil, and wondering if\r\nhe could drink it. Of course the native possessed it, along with the\r\nivory-headed spear and walrus-hide, but he was aged and weak, while\r\nWalton was young and strong. Age must sleep sometime. Walton leaped to\r\nthe berg. Neither man spoke.\r\n\r\nThe berg floated alone in the blue lead, fringed by floes on three\r\nsides. Hour after hour, the strange pair huddled in the scant protection\r\nof a small ice-hummock while the berg drifted. The Eskimo drew the\r\nwalrus-hide about him to break the wind seeking access to his age-weary\r\nlimbs. The spear lay on the ice in front of him within reach. He\r\ncontinued to ignore the white man; yet it was apparent he tried to read\r\nhis thoughts. Walton found some solace in his pipe. His tobacco-pouch\r\nwas nearly full; the matchbox had been refilled that morning. Hours\r\ndragged slowly, but darkness came too soon.\r\n\r\nWalton had read that men freeze to death without realizing what is\r\ntaking place, but he found the cold aroused him even when he dozed. Then\r\nhe would leap to his feet and stamp about until warmth was restored. He\r\nwas desperately hungry, but not hungry enough to drink seal-oil. In any\r\nevent, when starvation drove him to the point of drinking the nauseous\r\nstuff, the Eskimo would have finished the last of it.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDay came, sunless. The sky was over-cast with the dreary gray of a\r\ncasket. The native stirred slightly and leaped to his feet. The\r\ncalculation he had made the day before was correct; the berg had become\r\na part of another floe, the vastness of which the eye could not measure.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo squirmed cautiously to the highest point in the immediate\r\nvicinity, then as cautiously returned, his eyes gleaming, the spear\r\ngripped tightly. He grunted in dialect, and glanced about; then Walton\r\nunderstood. A polar bear had sensed their presence and was making his\r\nway to them, hunting instead of being hunted. The native gripped his\r\nspear tighter as the bear drew near. It was an ordeal a strong man would\r\nhave shunned.\r\n\r\n“Give me your knife; it’s our only chance,” cried Walton. “We’ve got to\r\neat!”\r\n\r\nSuspicion flashed into the dark eyes; he waved the white man aside.\r\nWalton picked up a block of ice. “I’ll do what I can!” Again the native\r\nwaved him back, then crawled toward the beast in an effort to gain some\r\nadvantage in position. In a twinkling Walton had been thrust back into\r\nthe ages ten thousand years. He watched the impending struggle\r\nentranced. The Eskimo steeled himself, gathered together the last ounce\r\nof strength in his withered frame and put it all in one vicious lunge of\r\nthe spear.\r\n\r\nThe ivory head drove deep to a vital spot; blood gushed down the heavy\r\nwhite coat; the bear roared in pain. The spear was jerked from the\r\nEskimo’s hands as the brute turned, snarling, to attack. The native\r\nleaped backward and slipped swiftly down an icy slope to vanish on hands\r\nand knees. The bear pursued, leaving a red trail. Driven by hunger of\r\nthe raw man to do what he could to bring down the raw food, Walton\r\nfollowed cautiously. Presently the native emerged, crawling, each\r\nmovement a slow and painful effort. He had put his all into the single\r\nthrust; the effort had left him helpless, and he would have been an easy\r\nmark for the white man.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe spear was in the dying bear, Walton recalled. “Thank God, I wont be\r\ndriven to forget I’m civilized and prey on a miserable Eskimo--we’ve got\r\nbear-meat now!” He cried out aloud in utter relief. He had slipped fast\r\nduring the past day--he was ready to eat raw meat from the kill, and\r\nhunger-pangs drove him to risk attack from the wounded bear. He made his\r\nway along the bloodstained trail to the spot where the beast had\r\ndisappeared. Water lapped at the ice below him, water stained crimson.\r\nThe bear was gone! Fate had denied him even raw meat, but--there yet\r\nremained a skin filled with seal-oil.\r\n\r\nA struggle of the codes went on within him, and the code of raw men had\r\nan ally in hunger. He was slipping back with each passing hour; he knew\r\nit and fought it. From time to time he glanced toward the withered\r\nnative. The spear no longer lay on the ice in front of him, but he\r\nhugged the skin of oil even tighter to his breast. Walton caught himself\r\nplotting a route that would take him behind and above the Eskimo. Devils\r\nof his imagination whispered it would be easy; the native was unarmed\r\nsave for a knife--a futile thing against a block of ice dropped from\r\nabove. “He’s run his race; the end is near,” the voice of\r\nself-preservation whispered. “Your life is before you. You can do much\r\nfor the world, for you are civilized and educated. Take his clothing for\r\nwarmth, and his food for life. He is but a burden.” It was as if a voice\r\nhad spoken aloud, and Walton’s protest came from set teeth. “Damn\r\nit--I’m civilized and I can’t.”\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the day the Eskimo explored the ice in quest of a\r\nseal or bear. Each time he returned as silently as he had departed. He\r\ncontinued to ignore Walton. The white man had once referred to him as a\r\n“greasy, filthy Eskimo.”\r\n\r\nToward night the tip of the great floe broke from the main body of ice.\r\nThe Eskimo watched this without emotion, though it reduced their chances\r\nof finding game. Walton lighted his pipe, lest he go mad. In it,\r\nparticularly in the fire in the bowl, he found solace. The Eskimo took\r\nhis first sip from the seal-oil.\r\n\r\nSelf-preservation came to him in his dreams the third night, awakened\r\nhim and remained. He was bitterly cold, needed additional clothing,\r\nwhile his whole being cried out for food. As before, self-preservation\r\npointed the way. Walton muttered aloud: “I can’t. I’m civilized. Mine’s\r\na different code. We care for our aged to the last. We don’t strangle\r\nand rob them.” Self-preservation jeered:\r\n\r\n“Of what avail is your civilization now? Will the few dollars in your\r\npocket buy food? Can your education kill a bear or seal and provide you\r\nwith meat? The books you studied might furnish you warmth now, if you\r\ncould burn them. You are no longer civilized; you are a raw man seeking\r\nfood. The miserable wretch who holds the food is done for anyway; he\r\nsleeps, so why not-- Ah! I knew it! At last you heed me.”\r\n\r\nAs animals stalk their prey, so Walton crawled over the ice, nearer and\r\nnearer the figure huddled in the gloom. His code was behind him; he was\r\nabout to kill, that he might survive a few days and perhaps be saved.\r\nSchooners were coming out of the ice. It was while hurdling the last\r\nbarrier, that their own craft had been crushed.\r\n\r\nNow that he meant to kill, he found himself debating on the method.\r\nWould it be knife or hands? His pocketknife might do the work; still--\r\nThe native’s knife lay on the ice a few inches from the sleeping figure.\r\nWalton’s heart pounded as he possessed himself of the weapon. Its blade\r\nwas long and keen, and that settled the debate. “The knife,” he\r\nwhispered. “It’s quicker. It’ll be over with in an instant.”\r\n\r\nHe would have to ration the oil over a period of days, and not drink it\r\nall tomorrow, for there would be many of them. In the half-light the\r\nblade seemed ghostly white. It fascinated Walton, then filled him with\r\nsudden repulsion. He dropped it, his hand stayed by the thought of\r\nblood. Blood, red, living, leaping from an animal, was one thing; but a\r\nman-- His hands reached for the native’s throat, hands strong, powerful,\r\neven after several days’ fast. He had removed his mittens and now felt\r\nthe bite of the frost; then he touched the fur of the Eskimo’s parka\r\nhood. The throat was close now, and still the Eskimo slept. Walton’s\r\nfingers curved; then his hands dropped swiftly to the shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Good God, man, wake up and save us both! I’m--trying to remain a man!”\r\n\r\nThe native’s eyes opened without fear; he spoke quietly in English, even\r\nkindly: “My son, I am awake!”\r\n\r\n“You speak English!”\r\n\r\n“When I wish. I cared for one of the first missionaries who came North\r\nmany years ago, preaching of the white man and his God. He told us of\r\nhis code, that cared for the old. We killed ours when they could no\r\nlonger withstand the frost or follow the tribe. For a lifetime I have\r\nwondered about this code, and what would happen when a white man\r\nhungered. He taught me English, but he could not make a white man of me.\r\nMy code is different. It is a better code, for the race.\r\n\r\n“I have read that self-preservation is the first law of Nature. That is\r\nnot the truth. There is a nobler code. Self-preservation is the second\r\nlaw of Nature. The first law of Nature is race-preservation. Through it\r\nhumanity has survived, even my race. It governs the civilized races even\r\ntoday, for parents give their lives for their children. But my people\r\nare nearer to it than yours. When the food is low, it is the aged who\r\nstarve, that the worthy young may live and reproduce. Thus it has always\r\nbeen with my people; thus it always will be.\r\n\r\n“During the long months on the schooner I watched you. You called me\r\nfilthy, greasy. I wondered! You were the best educated man I had ever\r\nknown. You spoke like the books I read from; yet you were not a man.\r\nHanson and Schwartz were men. Civilization baffled me.\r\n\r\n“Age should give forth wisdom, and leave curiosity to youth, who must\r\never learn by experience. Strange that I should be curious at my age,\r\nbut I wondered which code would prevail, your code or the code of\r\nself-preservation. I watched your struggle! The outcome made little\r\ndifference to me. I’ve run my race; the end is near. Tonight I knew you\r\nwould come. I was afraid of your little pocketknife--the blade would not\r\ngo deep enough; so I left my own. A knife-thrust is nothing. Thus my\r\nfather and mother died, when he could no longer hunt, and she could no\r\nlonger chew walrus-hide and soften it for garments. You came nearer and\r\nnearer, and through half-closed eyes I saw the struggle in your face,\r\nand never did I see greater. You dropped the knife, then reached for my\r\nthroat--a withered column of skin and muscles that you could snap with\r\none of your strong hands. I thought you had gone back, and waited. So\r\nthis was your code, after all.... Then--you called.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalton nodded thoughtfully. “Yes, I won, or my code did--for a time.”\r\n\r\n“For all time. May I smoke your pipe? The missionary taught me that\r\ntobacco soothes.” Walton filled and lighted his pipe, then handed it to\r\nthe Eskimo. “Thanks, my son!”\r\n\r\nWalton remained silent until the native returned the pipe. The bowl\r\nstill glowed. Fire! That was what he craved next to food. Again he found\r\nsolace in the glowing bowl. The Eskimo placed the skin of oil at\r\nWalton’s feet. “You thought you would never come to it, but you will.\r\nYou will even gnaw the skin itself.” The walrus-hide came next; then the\r\nnative slowly pulled off his parka.\r\n\r\nWalton leaped to his feet. “Hold on!” he cried. “What are you thinking\r\nof?”\r\n\r\n“We are different; each man’s code prevails, my son!” replied the\r\nnative. “Your race must go on, even as mine. You are young and--worthy.”\r\n\r\n“Hell!” Walton jerked the parka back on. “Let’s stick it out together.\r\nAnd anyway, I wont be missed, and don’t worry about my race not going\r\non. There’s over a hundred million of them left, and they’ll get along\r\nsomehow.” Gently he pushed the old man to the ice and wrapped the\r\nwalrus-hide about him. “Stay right there, old-timer. I’ll take a sip of\r\nthe oil, if you don’t mind, though.” He put the skin to his mouth and\r\nwithdrew it abruptly. “Ugh! I can’t do it!”\r\n\r\nWalton lighted his pipe and propped himself against a convenient block\r\nof ice. The wind could not reach him; he would be comfortable until the\r\ncold got to him once more; then he’d have to leap about a bit. He closed\r\nhis eyes and found strange peace and contentment, for he had measured up\r\nto the standard of his breed. More, he had at last found himself. He was\r\ntoo late, of course, and he wouldn’t be missed much, except by the folks\r\nat home. “If there was only some way of getting word to the folks,” he\r\nmused. “As it is, they’ll always remember me as I was. They’ll never\r\nknow what happened--and Father will go down to his grave, never knowing\r\nthat what he did was right....” The pipe clattered to the ice, as Walton\r\nat last fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo reached forth and finished the pipe. Then he stood up and\r\nwrapped the walrus-skin about the sleeping white man. He shivered as he\r\nstripped off his parka and placed it with his mukluks on the ice.\r\nPresently his naked feet touched the ice; the frost-laden wind nipped at\r\nhis wrinkled skin as he made his way to the floe’s edge. Water, black\r\nand dreary, surged about the floe, waiting. “That the race may go on!”\r\nhe whispered. “My code holds throughout time. God help--the lad.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalton was warm when he awakened. At first he could not understand. He\r\nmust have slept long, because the sun was shining somewhere behind the\r\nsoutherly arc of that leaden sky. There was protest on his lips as he\r\ncrawled from beneath the walrus-hide. “Now, I say--” he began; then he\r\nunderstood. The skin of seal-oil, the pitiful furry pile of parka and\r\nother garments, the stiff mukluks, told it all. Except for the single\r\nsip, the skin of oil had been untouched. The native had starved with\r\nhim, then left him his all. Walton made his way to the water’s edge,\r\ntaking the trail trod by naked feet not many hours ago. He looked\r\nthoughtfully at the water as if seeking means to convey that which was\r\nin his heart.\r\n\r\n“‘Greater love hath no man--’” he began, then dropped to his knees. The\r\nwater lapped desolately at the floe as if to claim it and that which it\r\nheld for all time; the breath of the Arctic nipped spitefully at the\r\nexposed parts of his face. “O God,” he cried, “make me worthy of the\r\nsacrifice of a--Man!”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProvisions aboard the trading schooner _Sealth_ were low, but her\r\nskipper ignored that as he picked his way through narrow leads into the\r\nvery jaws of the pack. It had been ten years since Madison had been\r\nrescued from an iceberg, and he had never forgotten it. Veterans of the\r\nArctic shook their heads in doubt as they glanced from the icy fangs of\r\nthe floes to the grim figure in the wheelhouse. He was reckless at\r\ntimes, daring, but never had he seemed to cast discretion to the Arctic\r\nwinds. Always he was lashed with the thought that if he went a mile\r\nfarther into the ice, his quest might be successful--that if he turned\r\nback, he might leave fellow-humans to perish.\r\n\r\nThe man in the bow fending off smaller bergs with a pike-pole cursed,\r\nfor his parka hood was frozen where the moisture from his breath had\r\ncongealed. One mass larger than the others loomed up. Beyond that, man\r\ncould not go, unless he was fitted with wings. And then--the man in the\r\nbow dropped the pole to the deck; forgotten was his frozen beard as he\r\ncried out and pointed dead ahead.\r\n\r\nIce was knocked off from the blocks and falls, and a boat gotten over\r\nthe side. Madison stood in the stern, steering. Two held it to the ice\r\nwhile the skipper and two others leaped to the floe. Out in the lead the\r\nmate was already maneuvering the schooner about for the southerly\r\nflight. “Old Walton’s kid,” muttered Madison. “Looks about like I did\r\nwhen they found me. He’ll live. Lucky thing the old man radioed me to\r\ntake a look.” He picked up a bit of gnawed skin that had once been\r\nfashioned to hold seal-oil. Except for the extra pair of mukluks, all\r\nclothing was on the man.
