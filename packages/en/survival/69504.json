For this end, he would naturally be induced, both\r\nto prepare weapons, and also to preconceive plans for resisting the\r\ndisturbers of his peace. His subsequent rencounters with beasts of\r\nprey would, therefore, be more frequently successful, not only in\r\neffectually repelling them when they should attack him, but also, in\r\nsome instances, in accomplishing their destruction. Hence, we can\r\nreadily and satisfactorily trace to the principles of necessity the\r\nadroitness and courage evidenced by the unenlightened nations of\r\nthe world, in their successful attacks on the most formidable of the\r\nbrute creation; and hence we can conceive that necessity may impel\r\nthe indolent to activity, and the coward to actions which would not\r\ndisgrace the brave. For man to attempt to subdue an animal whose\r\npowers and ferocity he regarded with superstitious dread, and the\r\nmotion of which he conceived would produce a vortex sufficient to\r\nswallow up his boat, or any other vessel in which he might approach\r\nit—an animal of at least six hundred times his own bulk, a stroke of\r\nthe tail of which might hurl his boat into the air, or dash it and\r\nhimself to pieces—an animal inhabiting at the same time an element in\r\nwhich he himself could not subsist; for man to attempt to subdue such\r\nan animal, under such circumstances, seems one of the most hazardous\r\nenterprizes of which the intercourse with the irrational world could\r\npossibly admit. And yet this animal is successfully attacked, and\r\nseldom escapes when once he comes within reach of the darts of his\r\nassailer.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the opinion of most writers on the subject of the\r\nwhale-fishery, that the Biscayans were the first who succeeded in\r\nthe capture of the whale. This opinion, though perhaps not correct,\r\ndeserves to be mentioned in the outset of an investigation into the\r\nprobable origin of this employment. A species of whale, probably\r\nthe _Balæna rostrata_, was a frequent visitor to the shores of\r\nFrance and Spain. In pursuit of herrings and other small fishes,\r\nthese whales would produce a serious destruction among the nets of\r\nthe fishermen of Biscay and Gascony. Concern for the preservation of\r\ntheir nets, which probably constituted the whole of their property,\r\nwould naturally suggest the necessity of driving these intruding\r\nmonsters from their coasts. With this view, arrows and spears, and\r\nsubsequently gunpowder, would be resorted to. Finding the whales\r\ntimid and inoffensive, the fishers would be induced to approach\r\nsome individual of the species, and even to dart their spears\r\ninto its body. Afterwards they might conceive the possibility of\r\nentangling some of the species, by means of a cord attached to a\r\nbarbed arrow or spear. One of these animals being captured, and its\r\nvalue ascertained, the prospect of emolument would be sufficient\r\nto establish a fishery of the cetaceous tribe, and lead to all the\r\nbeneficial effects which have resulted in modern times.\r\n\r\nThose authorities, indeed, may be considered as unquestionable, which\r\ninform us that the Basques and Biscayans, so early as the year 1575,\r\nexposed themselves to the perils of a distant navigation, with a view\r\nto measure their strength with the whales, in the midst of an element\r\nconstituting the natural habitation of these enormous animals;\r\nthat the English, in 1594, fitted an expedition for Cape Breton,\r\nintended for the fishery of the whale and the walrus, (sea-horse,)\r\npursued the walrus-fishing in succeeding years in high northern\r\nlatitudes, and, in 1611, first attacked the whale near the shores of\r\nSpitzbergen; and that the Hollanders, and subsequently other nations\r\nof Europe, participated in the risk and advantages of these northern\r\nexpeditions. Some researches, however, on the origin of this fishery,\r\ncarried on in the northern seas, will be sufficient to rectify the\r\nerror of these conclusions, by proving that the whale-fishery by\r\nEuropeans may be traced as far back at least as the ninth century.\r\n\r\nThe earliest authenticated account of a fishery for whales is\r\nprobably that contained in Ohthere’s voyage, by Alfred the Great.\r\nThis voyage was undertaken about 890, by Ohthere, a native of\r\nHalgoland, in the diocese of Dronthein, a person of considerable\r\nwealth in his own country, from motives of mere curiosity, at his\r\nown risk, and under his personal superintendence. On this occasion,\r\nOhthere sailed to the northward, along the coast of Norway, round\r\nthe North Cape, to the entrance of the White Sea. Three days after\r\nleaving Dronthein, or Halgoland, “he was come as far towards the\r\nnorth as commonly the whale-hunters used to travel.” Here Ohthere\r\nevidently alludes to the hunters of the walrus, or sea-horse; but\r\nsubsequently, he speaks pointedly as to a fishery for some species\r\nof cetaceous animals having been at that period practised by the\r\nNorwegians. He told the king, that with regard to the common kind of\r\nwhales, the place of most and best hunting for them was in his own\r\ncountry, “whereof some be forty-eight ells of length and some fifty,”\r\nof which sort, he affirmed, that he himself was one of the six who,\r\nin the space of three (two) days, killed threescore.\r\n\r\nFrom this it would appear, that the whale-fishery was not only\r\nprosecuted by the Norwegians so early as the ninth century, but\r\nthat Ohthere himself had personal knowledge of it. The voyage of\r\nOhthere is a document of much value in history, both in respect to\r\nthe matter of it, and the high character of the author by whom it\r\nhas been preserved. By a slight alteration in the reading of the\r\nSaxon manuscript, as suggested by Turner, in his History of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, it is possible to suppose that the threescore animals\r\nslain by Ohthere in two days were not whales but dolphins. This\r\nsupposition removes the improbability of the exploit recorded, and\r\ndoes not contradict or explain away the fact of larger whales having\r\nbeen likewise hunted and captured.\r\n\r\nA Danish work, which there is reason to believe is of a date much\r\nearlier than that which we assign to the first fishery of the\r\nBasques, declares that the Icelanders were in the habit of pursuing\r\nthe whales, which they killed on the shore, and that these islanders\r\nsubsisted on the flesh of some one of the species. And Langebek does\r\nnot hesitate to assert, that the fishery of the whale (_hovlfangst_,\r\nby which he probably means a species of _delphinus_,) was practised\r\nin the most northern countries of Europe in the ninth century.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of 875, in a book entitled the “Translation and\r\nMiracles of St. Vaast,” mention is made of the whale-fishery on the\r\nFrench coast. In the “Life of St. Arnould, bishop of Soissons,” a\r\nwork of the eleventh century, particular mention is made of the\r\nfishery by the harpoon, on the occasion of a miracle said to have\r\nbeen performed by the saint. There are also different authorities\r\nfor supposing that a whale-fishery was carried on near the coast of\r\nNormandy and Flanders, from the eleventh to the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe English, it is to be expected, did not remain long behind their\r\ncontinental neighbours in this lucrative pursuit. It is difficult to\r\ndetermine whether the whales referred to in the few early documents\r\nwhich we possess, were such as were run on the English shore by\r\naccident, or subdued by the English on the high sea. By Acts of\r\nParliament, A.D. 1315 and 1324, the wrecks of whales, cast by chance\r\nupon the shore, or whales or great sturgeons _taken_ in the sea, were\r\nto belong to the king. Henry IV. gave, in 1415, to the church of\r\nRochester, the tithe of the whales taken along the shores of that\r\nbishopric. In the sixteenth century, the inhabitants of the shores\r\nof the Bay of Biscay were the most distinguished whale-fishers. At\r\nfirst, they confined their attacks to those animals, probably the\r\n_Balæna rostrata_ of Linnæus, which used to present themselves in\r\nthe Bay of Biscay at a certain season every year. Gradually becoming\r\nbolder, the Biscayans advanced towards the coasts of Iceland,\r\nGreenland, and Newfoundland, in the pursuit. The Icelanders united\r\ntheir energies with the Biscayans, and conducted the whale-fishery on\r\nso extensive a scale, that, towards the end of the sixteenth century,\r\nthe number of vessels annually employed by the united nations\r\namounted to a fleet of fifty or sixty sail.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt of the English to capture the whale, of which we\r\nhave any satisfactory account, was made in the year 1594. Different\r\nships were fitted out for Cape Breton at the entrance of the Gulf of\r\nSt. Lawrence, part of which were destined for the walrus-fishery,\r\nand the remainder for the whale-fishery. The Grace, of Bristol, one\r\nof these vessels, took on board 700 or 800 whale-fins, or laminæ of\r\nwhalebone, which they found in the Bay of St. George, where two large\r\nBiscayan fishermen had been wrecked three years before. This is the\r\nfirst notice I have met with of the importation of this article into\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nHowever doubtful it might have appeared at one time whether the\r\nEnglish or the Dutch first visited Spitzbergen, the claim of the\r\nEnglish to the discovery and first practice of the whale-fishery on\r\nthe coasts of these islands stands undisputed, the Dutch themselves\r\nallowing that the English preceded them four years. The merchants of\r\nHull, who were ever remarkable for their assiduous and enterprizing\r\nspirit, fitted out ships for the whale-fishery so early as the year\r\n1598, which they continued regularly to prosecute on the coasts of\r\nIceland and near the North Cape for several years; and after the\r\nre-discovery of Spitzbergen by Hudson, in 1607, they were the first\r\nto push forward to its coasts. Captain Jonas Poole was, in the\r\nyear 1610, sent out on a voyage of discovery by the “Company for\r\nthe Discovery of unknown Countries,” the “Muscovy Company,” or the\r\n“Russia Company,” as it was subsequently denominated. On his return,\r\nthe company fitted out two ships for the fishery; the Marie Margaret,\r\nof 160 tons, under the direction of Thomas Edge, factor; and the\r\nElizabeth, of 60 tons, Jonas Poole, master. In this voyage, both\r\nships were lost, but the cargo was brought home in a Hull ship.\r\n\r\nSuch a novel enterprize as the capture of whales, which was rendered\r\npractical, and even easy, by the number in which they were found,\r\nand the convenience of the situations in which they occurred—an\r\nenterprize at the same time calculated to enrich the adventurers\r\nfar beyond any other branch of trade then practised—created a great\r\nagitation, and drew towards it the attention of all the commercial\r\npeople of Europe. With that eagerness which men invariably display\r\nin the advancement of their worldly interests, but which is seldom\r\ndirected with equal vigour to objects of higher and eternal\r\nimportance, the mercantile spirit was concentrated on this new\r\nquarter, and vessels from various ports began to be fitted for the\r\nfishery. In the next year, three foreign ships made their appearance\r\nalong with the two belonging to the Russia Company. The English,\r\njealous of the interference of the Dutch, would not allow them to\r\nfish, and obliged them to return home. In the following year, the\r\nEnglish Russia Company obtained a royal charter, excluding all\r\nothers, both natives and foreigners, from the fishery, and they\r\nequipped seven armed vessels for the purpose of maintaining their\r\nprerogative. In the course of the season, the English attacked\r\nthe foreign vessels, and took from them the greater proportion\r\nof the blubber, or oil, and whale-fins, which they had procured,\r\ndriving them, together with some English ships fitted out by\r\nprivate individuals, out of the country. In 1614, a company was\r\nestablished in Amsterdam, and a charter obtained for three years;\r\nships of war were sent out, and the Hollanders, in defiance of\r\nthe English, were able to fish without interruption. The English\r\ngot but half-laden, and the Dutch made but a poor fishing. After\r\nvarious disagreements, and the arrival of the vessels of other\r\npowers on the fishing-stations, which tended to divide the quarrel,\r\na conference for the purpose of adjusting their differences ensued\r\nbetween the captains of the rival nations, and they agreed at length\r\nto a division of those fine bays and commodious harbours with which\r\nthe whole coast of Spitzbergen abounded. The English obtained the\r\nfirst choice, and a greater number of bays and harbours than any\r\nof the rest. After the English, the Dutch, Danes, Hamburghers, and\r\nBiscayans, and, finally, the Spaniards and French, took up their\r\npositions. Thus we perceive the origin of the names of the different\r\nplaces called English Bay, Hollanders’ Bay, Danes’ Bay, etc.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements having been adopted, each nation prosecuted the\r\nfishery in its own possession, or along the sea-coast, which was\r\nfree for all. It was understood, however, that the ships of any\r\nnation might resort to any of the bays or harbours whatever, for\r\nthe convenience of awaiting a favourable wind, taking refuge from\r\na storm, or any other emergency. To prevent the prosecution of the\r\nfishery in bays belonging to other nations, it was agreed that\r\nwhenever a boat was lowered in a strange harbour, or happened to row\r\ninto the same, the harpoon was always to be removed from its rest, so\r\nas not to be in readiness for use.\r\n\r\nAll the early adventurers on the whale-fishery were indebted to\r\nthe Biscayans for their superintendence and help. They were the\r\nharpooners, and the coopers “skilful in setting up the staved cask.”\r\nAt this period, each ship carried two principals; the commander,\r\nwho was a native, was properly the navigator, as his chief charge\r\nconsisted in conducting the ship to and from Greenland; the other,\r\nwho was called by the Dutch, specksynder, or cutter of the fat, as\r\nhis name implies, was a Biscayan, and had the unlimited control of\r\nthe people in the fishery, and, indeed, every operation belonging to\r\nit was entirely confided to him. When, however, the fishery became\r\nbetter known, the commander assumed the general superintendence, and\r\nthe specksynder, or specksioneer, is now the principal harpooner, and\r\nhas the “ordering of the fat,” and the extracting or boiling of the\r\noil of the whale, but serves under the direction of the commander.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch pursued the whale-fishery with more vigour than the\r\nEnglish, and with still better effect. It was no uncommon thing\r\nfor them to procure such vast quantities of oil that empty ships\r\nwere required to take home the superabundant produce. In 1622, the\r\ncharter of the Amsterdam Company was renewed for twelve years, and\r\nthe charter of the Zealand Society was extended about the same time,\r\nwhereby the latter were allowed to establish themselves in Jan Mayen\r\nIsland, and to erect boiling-houses and cooperages in common with\r\ntheir associates. The privileges of these companies, occasioning the\r\nexclusion of all other persons belonging to the United Provinces,\r\nproduced a considerable degree of discontent, when the fishery,\r\ntowards the expiration of these last charters, was in its most\r\nflourishing state. The states-general of Friesland were induced to\r\ngrant a charter to a company formed in that province, which endowed\r\nthem with similar privileges to those of the other companies of\r\nHolland. The Frieslanders, in the year 1634, perceived the advantage\r\nof procuring the sanction of the Zealand and Amsterdam companies to\r\ntheir right to participate in the fishery, and after negotiation, the\r\nthree companies, according to stipulated conditions, contracted a\r\ntriple union. The Dutch followed the whale-fishery with perseverance\r\nand profit, and were successfully imitated by the Hamburghers and\r\nother fishermen of the Elbe, but the English made only occasional\r\nvoyages.\r\n\r\nIt became apparent to the adventurers in the whale-fishery, that\r\nconsiderable advantages might be realized could Spitzbergen be\r\nresorted to as a permanent residence, and they were desirous of\r\nascertaining the possibility of the human species subsisting\r\nthroughout the winter in this inhospitable climate. The English\r\nmerchants offered considerable rewards, and the Russia Company\r\nprocured the reprieve of some culprits who were convicted of capital\r\noffences, to whom they promised pardon and a pecuniary remuneration\r\nif they would remain a single year in Spitzbergen. The fear of\r\nimmediate death induced them to comply; but when they were carried\r\nout and showed the desolate, frozen, and frightful country they\r\nwere to inhabit, they shrank back with horror, and solicited to be\r\nreturned home to suffer death in preference to encountering such\r\nappalling dangers. With this request the captain who had them in\r\ncharge humanely complied, and on their return to England the company\r\ninterceded on their behalf, and procured pardon.\r\n\r\nProbably it was about the same time that nine men, who were by\r\naccident separated from one of the London fishing-ships, were left\r\nbehind in Spitzbergen; all of them perished in the course of the\r\nwinter, and their bodies were found in the ensuing summer shockingly\r\nmangled by beasts of prey. The same master who abandoned these poor\r\nwretches to so miserable a fate was obliged, by the drifting of the\r\nice towards the shore, to leave eight of his crew, who were engaged\r\nin hunting reindeer for provision for the passage home, in the year\r\n1630. These men, like the former, were abandoned to their fate; for\r\non proceeding to the usual places of resort and rendezvous, they\r\nperceived with horror that their own, together with all the other\r\nfishing-ships, had departed. By means of the provisions procured by\r\nhunting, the fritters of the whale left in boiling the blubber,\r\nand the accidental supplies of bears, foxes, seals, and sea-horses,\r\ntogether with the judicious application of the buildings which were\r\nerected in Bell Sound, where they took up their abode, they were\r\nenabled not only to support life, but even to maintain their health\r\nlittle impaired, until the arrival of the fleet in the following\r\nyear. It is surely permitted us to hope, that amidst the retirement\r\nand dreariness of these frozen regions, these hardy sailors found\r\nopportunities for serious reflection and prayer to the God of\r\nheaven, and that their minds, with eternity so near to them, were\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the one way of salvation to yield\r\nthemselves to Him who is able to preserve his servants unto life\r\neternal.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of these men revived in the Dutch the desire of\r\nestablishing colonies, and in consequence of certain encouragements\r\nproclaimed throughout the fleet, seven men volunteered their\r\nservices, were landed at Amsterdam Island, furnished with the needful\r\narticles of provisions, etc., and were left by the fleet on the\r\n30th of August, 1633. About the same time, another party, likewise\r\nconsisting of seven volunteers, were landed on Jan Mayen Island, and\r\nleft by their comrades to endure the like painful service with the\r\nformer. On the return of the fleet in the succeeding year, this last\r\nparty were all found dead from the effects of the scurvy; but the\r\nother, which was left in Spitzbergen, nine degrees further towards\r\nthe north, all survived. Other seven volunteers proposed to repeat\r\nthe experiment in Spitzbergen during the ensuing winter, and were\r\nquitted by their comrades on the 11th of September, 1634. They all\r\nfell victims to the scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, encouraged by the hope that the profitable nature of\r\nthe whale-fishery would continue unabated, incurred very great\r\nexpenses in making secure, ample, and permanent erections, which\r\nthey gradually extended in such a degree that at length they assumed\r\nthe form of a respectable village, to which, from the Dutch words\r\n“smeer,” signifying fat, and “bergen,” to put up, they gave the name\r\nof Smeerenberg. Their expectations of continued success were not,\r\nhowever, justified, and the fishery began to decline so rapidly from\r\nthe year 1636-7, to the termination of the company’s charters, that\r\ntheir losses are stated on some occasions to have exceeded their\r\nformer profits. On the expiration of the charters, in the year 1642,\r\ntheir renewal was refused by the states-general, and the trade was\r\nlaid entirely open to all adventurers. It increased in consequence\r\nalmost tenfold; and on the dissolution of the monopoly, the shipping\r\nin the whale-fishery commerce accumulated to between two and three\r\nhundred sail. Prior to the time when the trade was laid open, the Jan\r\nMayen whale-fishery, like that of Spitzbergen, attained its maximum.\r\nThe prodigious destruction of whales occasioned their withdrawal,\r\nand the island was at length abandoned as a whale-fishing station.\r\n\r\nThe whale-fishery of the Dutch was somewhat suspended by the war\r\nwith England in 1653; but between the years 1660 and 1670, four or\r\nfive hundred sail of Dutch and Hamburgh ships were yearly visitants\r\nto the coasts of Spitzbergen, while the English sometimes did not\r\nsend a single ship. The British government saw with regret such\r\na profitable and valuable speculation entirely laid aside. To\r\nencourage, therefore, its renewal, an Act of Parliament was passed\r\nin 1672, whereby the rigours of the Navigation Act were dispensed\r\nwith, and its essential properties so modified for the ten following\r\nyears that a vessel for the whale-fishery, being British-built, and\r\nhaving a master and one-half of the crew British subjects, might\r\ncarry natives of Holland, or other expert fishers, to the amount of\r\nthe other half. In the year 1693 was formed the “Company of Merchants\r\nof London, trading to Greenland,” to whom was granted an extension\r\nof the indulgences allowed by this Act of Parliament. From various\r\nlosses, combined, probably, with unskilful management, this company\r\nwas so unfortunate that, before the conclusion of their term, their\r\ncapital of £82,000 was entirely expended. These circumstances tended\r\nmuch to discourage the subjects of Great Britain from making any\r\nvigorous attempt to renew the fishery. The direct importation of\r\nGreenland produce into England being inconsiderable, its importation\r\nfrom Holland or other foreign states was permitted; whalebone,\r\nhowever, was required to be brought into the country in fins only,\r\nand not cut, or in any way manufactured; nor could it be landed\r\nbefore the duty chargeable thereon was secured or paid, under penalty\r\nof the forfeiture of the goods and double their value. Immense sums\r\nwere annually paid to foreigners for whalebone at this period.\r\n\r\nIt was not, it appears, until the whale-fishery was on the decline\r\nat Spitzbergen, that the Davis’s Strait fishery was resorted to. The\r\nDutch sent their first ships in the year 1719. The shipping employed\r\nin the Greenland and Davis’s Strait whale-fisheries, in 1721, by\r\nforeign nations, amounted to three hundred and fifty-five sail. When,\r\nby the lapse of some years, the unfavourable impression produced on\r\nthe minds of speculative persons by the immense losses suffered by\r\nEnglish adventurers in the whale-fishery had partly worn off, the\r\npropriety of attempting this trade was suggested by Henry Elking, and\r\nwas proposed to the directors of the well-known South Sea Company.\r\nThe British legislature, by exempting the produce of the Greenland\r\nSeas from existing duties on the condition of its being imported in\r\nBritish ships, held out encouragements to the company similar to\r\nthose offered to former adventurers. The South Sea Company caused a\r\nfleet of twelve new ships, about 306 tons’ burden each, to be built\r\nin the river Thames, equipped each vessel with the necessary supplies\r\nof cordage, casks, and fishing instruments, and engaged for their\r\nuse the duke of Bedford’s wet-dock at Deptford, where boiling-houses\r\nand other conveniences were constructed. In the spring of 1725, the\r\nfleet being all in readiness, put to sea, and returned safe with\r\ntwenty-five and a half whales. The proceeds of this voyage, though\r\nscarcely sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the fitments\r\nand the hire of foreign harpooners, were yet superior to those of\r\nany succeeding year during the period in which the company pursued\r\nthe trade. For eight successive years the company persevered in the\r\nwhale-fishery, with indifferent or bad success, and after the season\r\nof 1732 were compelled to abandon it. In 1736, a London ship, which\r\nvisited the whale-fishery, procured a cargo of seven fish—a degree\r\nof success which was fortunately different from that of most of the\r\nantecedent English whalers. The English government offered a bounty\r\nof twenty shillings per ton on the burden or tonnage of all British\r\nwhale-fishing ships of 200 tons or upwards; and this, in 1749, was\r\nincreased to forty shillings per ton.\r\n\r\nGradually the British whale-fishery began to assume a respectable\r\nand hopeful appearance. The combined fleets of England and Scotland,\r\nin the year 1752, amounted to forty sail; in 1753, to forty-nine;\r\nin 1754, to sixty-seven, in 1755, to eighty-two; and in the year\r\nfollowing, to eighty-three sail—which was the greatest number of\r\nships employed in the trade for the twenty years following; while the\r\nleast number amounted to forty sail during the same period. On the\r\nestablishment of the British whale-fishery, the legislature directed\r\nits attention to the means for securing the perpetuity of the trade,\r\nand the economical application of the bounty. These enactments were\r\nnot carried in the House of Commons without considerable debate.\r\nIn 1768, the king of Prussia, interesting himself in the Greenland\r\nfishery, caused some ships to be equipped from Emden; and in 1784,\r\nthe king of France attempted the revival of the whale-fishery, by\r\nequipping, at his own expense, six ships in the port of Dunkirk. In\r\n1785, the king of Denmark, in imitation of the English, granted a\r\nbounty of about thirty shillings sterling per ton, to all vessels in\r\nthe Greenland and Iceland fisheries, on the condition of the ships\r\nbeing fitted out and their cargoes sold in a Danish port.\r\n\r\nThe Act of the British Parliament of 1786, embodying several\r\nadditional regulations on the subject of the whale-fishery, and\r\nrehearsing and revising former acts, has ever since been considered\r\nthe fundamental act on the subject of the Greenland and Davis’s\r\nStrait whale-fishery. By accounts laid upon the table of the House of\r\nCommons during this session, it appeared that the bounties granted\r\nfor the encouragement of the British whale-fisheries, carried on\r\nin the Greenland Sea and Davis’s Strait, from the year 1733, when\r\nbounties were first given, to the end of 1785, had amounted to\r\n£1,064,272. 18_s._ 2_d._ for England, and £202,158. 16_s._ 11_d._ for\r\nScotland. By a subsequent act, the bounty was reduced to twenty-five\r\nshillings per ton, from the 25th of December, 1792, to the 25th of\r\nDecember, 1795; and from this period until the expiration of the\r\nact in 1798, to twenty shillings per ton, at which latter rate it\r\nhas continued ever since. From a list, it appears, that in 1788,\r\n255 British ships sailed for the whale-fishery, of which 129 were\r\nof a burden under 300 tons; 97 of 300 to 350 tons; 16 of 350 to 400\r\ntons; 11 of 400 to 500 tons; 1 of 565 tons; and 1 of 987 tons. They\r\nwere fitted out from the ports of London, Hull, Liverpool, Whitby,\r\nNewcastle, Yarmouth, Sunderland, Lynn, Leith, Ipswich, Dunbar,\r\nAberdeen, Bo’ness, Glasgow, Montrose, Dundee, Exeter, Whitehaven,\r\nStockton, Greenock, Scarborough, Grangemouth, and Queensferry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n SITUATION OF THE EARLY WHALE-FISHERY—THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS\r\n CONDUCTED—AND THE ALTERATIONS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after the discovery of Spitzbergen by Hudson, in the year\r\n1607, the walrus-fishers, who carried on an extensive and profitable\r\nbusiness at Cherie Island, finding the animals of their pursuit\r\nbecome shy and less abundant, extended their voyage to the northward,\r\nuntil they fell in with Spitzbergen, the newly discovered country,\r\nabout the time when the Russian Company equipped their first ships\r\nfor the Greenland whale-fishery. As the coast abounded with whales\r\nand sea-horses, Cherie Island was deserted, and Spitzbergen became\r\nthe scene of future enterprize. At this time, the mysticetus was\r\nfound in immense numbers throughout the whole extent of the coast,\r\nand in the different capacious bays with which it abounds. Never\r\nhaving been disturbed, these animals were unconscious of danger;\r\nthey allowed themselves to be so closely approached that they fell\r\nan easy prey to the courageous fishermen. It was not necessary that\r\nthe ships should cruise abroad, throughout the extended regions of\r\nthe Polar Seas, as they do at the present time, for the whales being\r\nabundant in the bays, the ships were anchored in some convenient\r\nsituation, and generally remained at their moorings until their\r\ncargoes were completed. Not only did the coast of Spitzbergen abound\r\nwith whales, but the shore of Jan Mayen Island, in proportion to its\r\nextent, afforded them in like abundance.\r\n\r\nThe method used for capturing whales, at this period, was usually\r\nby means of the harpoon and lance, though the Dutch inform us that\r\nthe English made use of nets made with strong ropes for the purpose.\r\nThe harpoon, which was the instrument used in general practice for\r\neffecting their entanglement, consisted, as at present, of a barbed\r\nor arrow-shaped iron dart, two or three feet in length, to which was\r\nattached a wooden handle, for convenience in striking or throwing\r\nit into the whale. Fastened to the harpoon was a line or rope three\r\nhundred fathoms in length; more than sufficient to reach the bottom\r\nin the bays, where the depth of the water seldom exceeds eighty\r\nor one hundred fathoms; so that on a fish descending after being\r\nstruck, the end of the line could always be detained in the boat.\r\nThe movements of this boat, of course, corresponded with those of\r\nthe whale; and so closely pointed out its position, that, on its\r\nreappearance at the surface, the other assisting boats were usually\r\nvery near the place. It was then vigorously pursued, secured by a\r\nsufficient number of harpoons, and lastly attacked repeatedly with\r\nlances until it was killed.\r\n\r\nThe lance in use was an iron spear with a wooden handle, altogether\r\nten or twelve feet in length. The capture of the fish, in which,\r\nowing to the particular excellence of the situation, they seldom\r\nfailed, being accomplished, it was towed by the boats, rowing one\r\nbefore another “like a team of horses,” to the ship’s stern, where\r\nit lay untouched from one to two or three days. The fat being then\r\nremoved was carried to the shore, where ample conveniences being\r\nerected, it was afterwards subjected to heat in a boiler, and the\r\ngreater part of the oil extracted.\r\n\r\nAs the usual process of the early fishers for extracting the oil\r\nmay be interesting to some readers, I shall attempt to describe it,\r\nfollowing the accounts by captains Anderson and Gray, whose papers\r\nare preserved among the manuscripts in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe blubber being made fast to the shore, a “waterside man,”\r\nstanding in a pair of boots, mid-leg in the sea, flayed off the\r\nfleshy parts, and cut the blubber into pieces, of about two hundred\r\nweight each. Two men, with a barrow, then carried it, piece by\r\npiece, to a stage or platform, erected by the side of the works,\r\nwhere a man, denominated a “stage-cutter,” armed with a long knife,\r\nsliced it into pieces, one and a half inches thick, and about a\r\nfoot long, and then pushed it into an adjoining receptacle, called\r\na “slicing cooler.” Immediately beyond this cooler, five or six\r\nchoppers were arranged in a line, with blocks of whales’ tails\r\nbefore them; and adjoining these blocks was another vessel, called a\r\n“chopping cooler,” of two or three tons’ capacity. These men, being\r\nsituated between the two coolers, took the sliced blubber from the\r\nslicing cooler, and, after reducing it into little bits, scarcely\r\none-fourth of an inch thick, and an inch or two long, pushed it into\r\nthe chopping cooler. These operations were carried on as near as\r\nconvenient to the place where the copper was erected.\r\n\r\nThe copper held only half a ton. It was furnished with a furnace,\r\nand the requisite appendages. A man, designated “tub-filler,” with\r\na ladle of copper, was employed in filling a hogshead with chopped\r\nblubber, dragging it to the copper, and emptying it in, until the\r\ncopper was full. A fire of wood was, in the first instance, applied,\r\nbut after a copper or two had been boiled, the finks or fritters\r\nwere always sufficient to boil the remainder without any other fuel.\r\nWhen the blubber was sufficiently boiled, two men, called “copper\r\nmen,” with two long-handled copper ladles, took the oil and finks\r\nout of the copper, and put it into a “fritter barrow,” which, being\r\nfurnished with a grating of wood in place of a bottom, drained the\r\noil from the fritters, from whence it ran into a wooden tank or\r\ncooler, of about five tons’ capacity. Three coolers were usually\r\nprovided, and placed some feet asunder, a little below each other;\r\na quantity of water was put into each before the oil, and the oil,\r\nwhenever it came to a certain height in the first cooler, escaped\r\nthrough a hole, by a spout, into the second, the same way into the\r\nthird, and from thence, by a plug-hole, into the casks or butts\r\nin readiness for its reception. When the oil in these butts was\r\nthoroughly cold, whatever it had contracted was filled up, and the\r\ncasks then rolled into the water, and, in rafts of twenty together,\r\nwere conveyed into the ship.\r\n\r\nThe whalebone was separated from the gum, or substance in which it is\r\nimbedded, rubbed clean, packed in bundles, of sixty laminæ or blades\r\neach, and taken to the ship in the longboat. Thus prepared, the cargo\r\nwas conveyed home, either when a sufficiency was procured, or the\r\nclose of the season put an end to the fishing occupations. While some\r\nof the people belonging to the whale-ships were engaged in boiling\r\nthe blubber, the rest of the crew, it is probable, were occasionally\r\nemployed in the capture of other whales. Besides the buildings made\r\nuse of in boiling the blubber, the whale-fishers had other buildings\r\non shore for lodging the blubber-men in, and for the use of the\r\ncoopers employed in preparing the casks.\r\n\r\nSo long as the whales remained in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nfishing establishments, the boats were sent out of the bay, the fish\r\ncaptured at sea, towed into the harbour, stripped of the fat, and the\r\nblubber boiled in the manner described; but as the whales increased\r\ntheir distance, this plan of procedure became inconvenient, so that\r\nthe ships began to cruise about the sea, to kill the whales wherever\r\nthey found them, to take on board the blubber, and only occasionally\r\nto enter a port. So far now from having occasion for empty ships\r\nfor carrying away the superabundant produce, it was a matter of\r\ndifficulty and uncertainty to procure a cargo at all; and, with the\r\nmost prosperous issue, there was not sufficient time for landing\r\nthe cargo and extracting the oil; the blubber was therefore merely\r\npacked in casks and conveyed home, where the remaining operations of\r\nextracting the oil, and cleaning and preparing the whalebone, were\r\ncompleted. Hence, the various buildings, which had been erected at\r\na great expense, became perfectly useless; the coppers, and other\r\napparatus that were worth the removal, were taken away, and the\r\nbuildings of all the different nations, both at Spitzbergen and\r\nat Jan Mayen Island, were either wantonly razed to the ground, or\r\nsuffered to fall into a state of decay.\r\n\r\nWhen the whales first approached the borders of the ice, the fishers\r\nheld the ice in such dread, that whenever an entangled fish ran\r\ntowards it, they immediately cut the line. Experience, through time,\r\ninured them to it; occasionally they ventured among the loose ice,\r\nand the capture of small whales at fields was at length attempted,\r\nand succeeded. Some adventurous persons sailed to the east side of\r\nSpitzbergen, where the current, it is believed, has a tendency to\r\nturn the ice against the shore; yet here, finding the sea, on some\r\noccasions, open, they attempted to prosecute the fishery, and, it\r\nseems, with some success, a great whale-fishery having been made\r\nnear Stansforeland, in the year 1700. The retreat of the whales\r\nfrom the bays to the sea-coast, thence to the banks at a distance\r\nfrom land, thence to the borders of the ice, and finally to the\r\nsheltered situations afforded by the ice, appears to have been fully\r\naccomplished about the year 1700, or from that to 1720. The plan of\r\nprosecuting the fishery now underwent a material change, especially\r\nin reference to the construction of the ships, and the quality and\r\nquantity of the fishing apparatus.\r\n\r\nWhen the fishery could be effected entirely in the bay, or even\r\nalong the sea-coast, any vessels which were sea-worthy, however old\r\nor tender, were deemed sufficient to proceed to Spitzbergen, and\r\nwere generally found adequate to the purpose, especially as they\r\ndid not set out till the spring was far advanced, thereby avoiding\r\nobstructions from the ice and from sudden and destructive storms.\r\nWhen, however, the fishing had to be pursued in the open sea, new,\r\nor at least very substantial ships, became requisite, and even these\r\nit was found necessary to strengthen on the bows and stern, and on\r\nthe sides, by additional planks. A greater quantity of fishing-stores\r\nalso became needful. When fishing among the ice, the whales, after\r\nhaving been struck, frequently penetrated to a great distance out\r\nof the reach of their assailants, dragging the line away, until\r\nat length they found it necessary to cut it to prevent further\r\nloss. Hence, by the frequency of disasters among their ships, the\r\nincreased expense of their equipment, and the liability of losing\r\ntheir fishing-materials, such an additional expense was occasioned as\r\nrequired the practice of the most rigid economy to counterbalance it.\r\nThe destruction of the shipping by the ice, in the Dutch fleet alone,\r\nwas frequently near twenty sail in one year, and on some occasions\r\nabove that number. The Greenland men of the present day being mostly\r\nice-fishers, an account of the improved mode of fishing now practised\r\nwill be sufficient for the illustration of the method followed by the\r\nDutch and other nations at a more early period, particularly as the\r\nway in which the whale is pursued and killed is pretty nearly the\r\nsame at this time as it was a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nDavis’s Strait, or the sea lying between the west side of Old\r\nGreenland and the east side of North America, and its most northern\r\nislands, has generally, since the close of the seventeenth century,\r\nbeen the scene of an advantageous whale-fishery. This fishery was\r\nfirst attempted by the Dutch, in 1719; after which period it was\r\nusually resorted to by about three-tenths of their whalers, while\r\nseven-tenths proceeded to Spitzbergen. This fishery differs only\r\nfrom that of Spitzbergen or Greenland, in the sea being, in many\r\ndistricts, less incommoded with ice, and in the climate being\r\nsomewhat more mild. The alterations which have taken place in it are,\r\nin some measure, similar to those which have occurred at Spitzbergen.\r\nThe fish which, half a century ago, appear to have resorted to all\r\nparts of the western coast of Old Greenland, in a few years retired\r\nto the northward, but they still remained about the coast. Of late,\r\nhowever, they have deserted some of the bays which they formerly\r\nfrequented, and have been principally caught in icy situations in\r\na high latitude, or in the opening of Hudson’s Strait, or at the\r\nborders of the western ice, near the coast of Labrador.\r\n\r\nBaffin’s Bay was suggested as an excellent fishing-station, by the\r\nvoyager whose name it bears, so early as the year 1616, when his\r\nmemorable navigation was performed. Baffin, in a letter addressed to\r\nJ. Wostenholm, esq., observes, that great numbers of whales occur\r\nin the bay, and that they are easy to be struck; and, though ships\r\ncannot reach the proper places until toward the middle of July, “yet\r\nthey may well tarry till the last of August, in which space much\r\nbusiness may be done, and good store of oil made.” To this situation,\r\nwhere the whales have never been molested until recently, it appears\r\nthey still resort in the same manner, and in similar numbers, as\r\nin the time of Baffin. In 1817, two or three of the Davis’s Strait\r\nwhalers proceeded through the strait into Baffin’s Bay, to a much\r\ngreater length than they were in the habit of adventuring, where,\r\nin the months of July and August, they found the sea clear of ice,\r\nand in some parts abounding with whales. A Leith ship, which, it\r\nappears, advanced the furthest, made a successful fishery in lat.\r\n76°-77°, after the season when it was usual for ships to depart. This\r\nfact having become generally known, several other ships followed the\r\nexample, in the season of 1818, and persevered through the barrier\r\nof ice lying in 74°-75° towards the north. After they had succeeded\r\nin passing this barrier, they found, as in the preceding year, a\r\nnavigable sea, where several ships met with considerable success in\r\nthe fishery, at a very advanced period of the season. This discovery\r\nis likely to prove of great importance to the fishery of Davis’s\r\nStrait. Ships, which fail of success in the old stations, will still,\r\nin the new fishery, have a reserve of the most promising character.\r\nHence, instead of this fishery being necessarily closed in July, the\r\nperiod when the whales have usually made their final retreat from\r\nthe old fishing-stations, it will in future be extended to the end\r\nof August at least; and it may ultimately appear that there will be\r\nlittle danger of ships being permanently frozen up, unless previously\r\nbeset in the ice during any part of the month of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  ACCOUNT OF THE MODERN WHALE-FISHERY, AS CONDUCTED AT SPITZBERGEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe commence this chapter with a description of a well-adapted\r\nGreenland ship, and of the manner in which it should be strengthened\r\nto resist the concussions of the ice. A ship intended for the\r\nGreenland or Davis’s Strait trade, should be of three or four\r\nhundred tons’ admeasurement, very substantially built, doubled, and\r\nfortified; should have six or seven feet perpendicular space between\r\ndecks; should be furnished with a description of sails which are\r\neasily worked; and should possess the property of fast sailing. The\r\nmost appropriate dimensions of a ship intended for the northern\r\nwhale-fisheries, seems to be that which is so large as to be capable\r\nof deriving the greatest advantage from the best opportunity, and no\r\nlarger. A vessel of 250 tons requires nearly the same number of men,\r\nthe same quantity of provisions and stores, and the same expense of\r\noutfit, as a ship of 350 tons’ burden; while the difference in the\r\ncargoes of the two vessels when filled, is in one voyage more than\r\na compensation for the difference in the first expense. Besides, for\r\nwant of similar room and convenience, the smaller ship has not always\r\nan equal chance of succeeding in the fishery with the larger. And,\r\nas ships of about 350 tons’ burden have been occasionally filled,\r\nvessels of 250 tons are too small for the fishery. Ships of 350 tons’\r\nburden have, we observe, been occasionally filled, but we know of no\r\ninstance in which a ship of 400 tons, of the usual capacious build,\r\nhas been deficient in capacity for taking in as large a cargo as of\r\nlate years there has been any opportunity of procuring. We therefore\r\nconclude, that an increase of dimensions above 400 tons is an actual\r\ndisadvantage, and that a ship of intermediate size, between 300 and\r\n400 tons, is best adapted for the fishery.\r\n\r\nGreenland ships, in the early ages of the fishery, were very\r\nindifferent structures, and even of late shipping of inferior quality\r\nwere generally deemed sufficient for the trade. At present, however,\r\nwhen a good fishery is rarely made without frequent exposure to\r\nthe ice, and sometimes in very critical situations, the vessels\r\nrequire to be substantially built, for the purpose of resisting the\r\noccasional pressure of, and frequent blows from, the ice, to which\r\nthe ships of persevering fishermen must always be more or less\r\nexposed. The requisites peculiar to a Greenland ship, the intention\r\nof which is to afford additional strength, consist of doubling,\r\nand sometimes trebling, and fortifying. The terms “doubling” and\r\n“trebling,” are expressive of the number of layers of planks, which\r\nare applied to the exterior of a frame of timbers; hence, a ship\r\nwhich has one additional series of planks, is said to be doubled,\r\nand such ships as are furnished with two, or part of two, additional\r\nlayers of planks, are said to be trebled. Doubling generally consists\r\nof the application of two or two half inches oak plank, near the bow,\r\ndiminishing towards the stern to perhaps half that thickness, and\r\nextending in one direction from the lower part of the main-wales,\r\nto within six feet perpendicular of the keel forward, and to within\r\neight or nine feet abaft; and, in the other direction, that is, fore\r\nand aft-wise, from the stem to the stern-post. Doubling is used\r\nfor producing an increase of strength, and at the same time for\r\npreserving the outside or main planks of the ship from being injured\r\nby the friction of passing ice. Trebling, which commonly consists of\r\none and a half to two inches oak plank, is generally confined to the\r\nbows of the ship, and rarely extends farther aft than the fore-chains\r\nor chesstree. It is seldom applied but to second-rate ships. Its\r\nprincipal use is to increase the strength of the ship about the bows,\r\nbut it also, serves to preserve that part of the doubling which it\r\ncovers from being destroyed by the ice.\r\n\r\nFortifying is the operation of strengthening a ship’s stern and\r\nbows by the application of timber and iron plates to the exterior,\r\nand a vast number of timbers and stanchions to the interior. Four\r\nstraight substantial oak timbers, called ice-beams, about twelve\r\ninches square and twenty-five feet in length, are placed beneath the\r\nhold-beams, butting with their foremost extremity against a strong\r\nfore-hook, and extending nearly at right angles across three or four\r\nof the hold-beams, into each of which they are notched and secured,\r\nat the point of intersection, by strong iron bolts, with the addition\r\nof “cleats” on the aftermost-beams. The fore-part of the ice-beams,\r\nwhich butt against the hook, are placed at a small distance from\r\neach other, from whence they diverge in such a way that their other\r\nextremities divide the aftermost beams under which they pass into\r\nfive equal parts. The next important part of the fortification is the\r\n_pointers_, which consist of four or more crooked timbers, fitting\r\nthe curve of the ship’s bow on each side; these are placed below the\r\nhold-beams, against the inside of the ceiling, nearly parallel with\r\nthe direction of the planks, some butting against the fore-hooks,\r\nand others passing between them. Across these pointers, four or five\r\nsmaller timbers, called “riders,” disposed at regular distances, are\r\nplaced at right angles, that is, in the same direction as the ribs of\r\nthe ship. Now, from each of the points of intersection of the riders\r\nand pointers, consisting of eighteen or twenty on each side of the\r\nship, a stanchion, or shore, proceeds to the edge of one of the two\r\nice-beams, placed on the same side, where it is secured in a rabbet.\r\nThe ice-beams are supported and connected by several strong pieces of\r\nwood, placed between each two, in different parts, called “carlings,”\r\nwhereby they are made to bear as one. It is evident that a blow\r\nreceived on the starboard-bow will be impressed on the adjoining\r\npointers, and the impression communicated, through the medium of the\r\nlateral timbers, or shores, to the two ice-beams on the same side,\r\nthence by the carlings to the other ice-beams, and then, by the\r\nshores on the opposite side to the larboard-bow and annexed pointers.\r\nA blow cannot be received on any part of one bow, without being\r\ncommunicated by the fortification to every part of the opposite bow,\r\nwhile every part to and through which the impression is communicated\r\nmust tend to support that place on which the blow is impressed.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the stem from being shattered or bruised by direct blows\r\nfrom the ice, it is strengthened by an extra piece called the false,\r\nor ice-stem. On the side of this are placed the ice-knees, which are\r\nangular chocks, or blocks of wood, filling the concavity formed by\r\nthe stem and bow planks, and extending from about the eight feet mark\r\nto the loading mark. In the best style, the ice-knees are twelve to\r\nfifteen inches in thickness at the stem, diminishing to, perhaps,\r\nsix or eight inches thick at the distance of about eight feet from\r\nthe stem, from thence gradually becoming thinner, until they fall\r\ninto and incorporate with the common doubling, below the fore-part\r\nof the fore-chains. This makes a neat bow, and in point of strength\r\nis much preferable to the angular chocks or knees, which usually\r\nextend about five or six feet from the stem, and then terminate\r\nsomewhat abruptly upon the doubling. Ice-knees not only strengthen\r\nthe front of the bows, and prevent the main planks from being bruised\r\nor shattered, as far as they extend, but likewise protect the stem\r\nfrom the twisting effect of a side blow. The stem and the small part\r\nof the ice-knees adjoining, are still farther defended by plates of\r\nhalf-inch iron, called ice-plates, which are nailed upon the face of\r\nthe ice-stem, and partly on the ice-knees, to prevent them being cut\r\nby the ice.\r\n\r\nFor additional strength, as well as convenience, the hold-beams of\r\na Greenland ship should be placed low, or at a greater distance\r\nfrom the deck-beams than is usual in other merchantmen, leaving a\r\nclear space of six or seven feet between decks. The strength thus\r\nderived is principally serviceable when the ship is squeezed between\r\ntwo sheets of ice; because the nearer the pressure acts on the\r\nextremities of the beams, the greater is the resistance they are\r\ncalculated to offer. A large space between decks is found also, for\r\nmany reasons, to be most convenient.\r\n\r\nHammocks, as receptacles for sailors’ beds, being incommodious, the\r\ncrew are lodged in cabins or berths, erected in the half-deck; these\r\nconsist of twelve to twenty in number, each of which is calculated\r\nto contain two or three persons. When a ship is on fishing-stations,\r\nthe boats are required to be always ready for use; as such they\r\nare suspended from cranes, fixed on the sides of the ship, and are\r\nusually so contrived that a boat can be lowered down into the water,\r\nmanned, and pushed off from the ship, in the short space of a minute\r\nof time. Prior to the year 1813, a ship having seven boats carried\r\none at each waist, that is, between the main-mast and fore-mast, two\r\nat each quarter, one above the other and one across the stern. An\r\nimprovement on this plan, adopted in 1813, is to have the boats fixed\r\nin a line of three lengths of boats on each side.\r\n\r\nThe masts and sails of a Greenland vessel are not without their\r\npeculiarities. As it is an object of importance that a fishing-ship\r\nshould be easily navigated, under common circumstances, by a boat’s\r\ncrew of six or seven men, it is usual to take down royal masts, and\r\neven top-gallant masts, and sometimes to substitute a long light pole\r\nin place of a mizen top-mast; also, to adopt such sails as require\r\nthe least management. Courses set in the usual way require a number\r\nof men to work them when the ship is tacked; a course, therefore,\r\nmade to diminish as it descends, that is, narrowest at the foot\r\nor lower part, and extended by a boom, or yard below as well as\r\nabove, and this boom fastened by a tackle fixed at its centre to\r\nthe deck, swings with the yards, with little or no alteration, and\r\nis found particularly convenient. Fore-sails, on this principle,\r\nhave been in use about six or seven years. In 1816, I fitted a\r\nmain-sail or cross-jack, in the same way, the former of which we\r\nfound of admirable utility. Boom-courses are not only convenient in\r\ntacking, but are likewise a valuable acquisition when sailing among\r\ncrowded dangerous ice. As the safety of the ship depends, next to the\r\nskilfulness of the piloting officer, on a prompt management of the\r\nyards and sails, boom-courses are strikingly useful on account of the\r\nlittle attention they require when any alteration in the position\r\nof the sails becomes necessary; and when the ship’s head-way is\r\nrequired to be suddenly stopped in a situation where she cannot be\r\nluffed into the wind, boom-courses swinging simultaneously with the\r\ntop-tails are backed without any annoyance from tacks or sheets, and\r\nof course assist materially in effecting the intention. Such is the\r\nadvantage of this description of sails, that on one occasion, when\r\nall the rest of my crew were engaged in the capture of a whale, with\r\nthe assistance of only two men, neither of them sailors, I repeatedly\r\ntacked a ship of 350 tons’ burden under three courses, top-sails and\r\ntop-gallant sails, together with jib and mizen, in a strong breeze\r\nof wind. Gaf-sails between the masts, in the place of stay-sails,\r\nare likewise deservedly in much repute. To the mizen and try-sail,\r\nor gaf main-sail, that have been long in use, I have added a gaf\r\nfore-sail of similar form, besides which, my father has also adopted\r\ngaf top-sails between each mast. These sails produce an admirable\r\neffect when a ship is “on a wind,” which is the kind of sailing most\r\nrequired among the ice.\r\n\r\nHaving now described a Greenland ship, it is time to detail the\r\nproceedings on board of her, from putting to sea to her arrival\r\non the coast of Spitzbergen. When all necessary conditions have\r\nbeen fulfilled, and the ship cleared out at the custom-house, the\r\nfirst opportunity is embraced for putting to sea. This is generally\r\naccomplished in the course of the month of March, or at least before\r\nthe tenth of April. The crew of a whale-ship usually consists of\r\nforty to fifty men, comprising several classes of officers, such as\r\nharpooners, boat-steerers, line-managers, carpenters, coopers, etc.,\r\ntogether with fore-mast men, landmen, and apprentices. As a stimulus\r\nto the crew in the fishery, every individual, from the master down\r\nto the boys, besides his monthly pay, receives a gratuity for every\r\nsize fish caught during the voyage, or a certain sum for every tun\r\nof oil which the cargo produces. Masters and harpooners, in place of\r\nmonthly wages, receive a small sum in advance before sailing, and if\r\nthey procure no cargo whatever, they receive nothing more for their\r\nvoyage; but in the event of a successful fishing, their advantages\r\nare considerable. The master usually receives three guineas for each\r\nsize fish, and as much for striking a size whale or discovering a\r\ndead one, together with ten shillings to twenty shillings per tun\r\non oil, and commonly a thirtieth, a twenty-fifth, or a twentieth of\r\nthe value of the cargo besides. He also has about £5 per month for\r\nhis attendance on the ship while he remains on shore. Each harpooner\r\nhas usually 6_s._ per tun on oil, together with half a guinea for\r\nevery size fish he may strike during the voyage. In addition to\r\nwhich the chief-mate, who is generally also harpooner, has commonly\r\ntwo guineas per month when at sea, and a guinea for each size fish.\r\nThe specksioneer, or chief-harpooner, has also half a guinea per\r\nfish, and sometimes a trifle per tun of oil additional; and the\r\nsecond-mate, and other officers who serve in a compound capacity,\r\nhave some additional monthly wages. Boat-steerers, line-managers,\r\nand fore-mast-men, commonly receive about 1_s._ 6_d._ per tun each,\r\nbesides their monthly pay, and landmen either a trifle per tun on\r\noil, or a few shillings for each size fish.\r\n\r\nFrom the difference in the wages paid in different ports, it is not\r\neasy to say what is the amount received by each class of officers\r\nbelonging to the whale-ships. In the general, however, it may be\r\nunderstood that, on a ship with 200 tuns of oil, which is esteemed an\r\nexcellent cargo, the chief-mate receives about £95 for his voyage,\r\na harpooner about £70, and a common sailor, or foremast-man, about\r\n£25. including advance money and monthly pay. As the master’s wages\r\ndepend as much on the value of the cargo as upon its quantity, it is\r\ndifficult to give an opinion as to the amount; generally speaking,\r\nhowever, with a cargo of 200 tuns of oil, he will receive about £250\r\nor £300, when his pay is according to the lowest scale; and perhaps\r\n£500 or £600, or upwards, when he is paid after the highest rate.\r\n\r\nIn time of war, the _manning_ of the whale-ships at the ports where\r\nthey were respectively fitted out being sometimes impracticable,\r\nand always a matter of difficulty, it was usual for the owners\r\nand masters of such ships to avail themselves of the privileges\r\nallowed by act of parliament of completing their crews in Shetland\r\nand Orkney. These islands were, therefore, the frequent resort of\r\nmost of the fishermen; those bound for Spitzbergen commonly put\r\ninto Shetland, and those for Davis’s Strait into Orkney. But in the\r\npresent time of peace, also, several ships, in consequence of the\r\nhigher wages demanded by the English seamen, have availed themselves\r\nof a late extension of the act for permitting a certain amount of\r\nextra men to be taken on board in Shetland or Orkney, during the\r\ncontinuance of the bounty system.\r\n\r\nIn Shetland, it is usual for the fishermen to _trim_ their ships,\r\nand complete their ballast, by filling most of their empty casks with\r\nwater, where it has not previously been done, to replenish their\r\nfresh water, to lay in stocks of eggs, fish, fowls, sea-sand, etc.,\r\nto divest the ships of all elevated lumber and gaudy appendages to\r\nthe masts and rigging, by way of preparing them for enduring the\r\nPolar storms with greater safety and convenience, and lastly, to fix\r\na “crow’s nest” or “hurricane house,” on the mast of each ship, and\r\nprepare a passage to it as safe and convenient as possible.\r\n\r\nThe “crow’s nest” is an apparatus placed on the main top-mast, or\r\ntop-gallant mast-head, as a kind of watch-tower for the use of the\r\nmaster or officer of the watch in the fishing-seas, for sheltering\r\nhim from the wind, when engaged in piloting the ship through crowded\r\nice, or for obtaining a more extensive view of the sea around when\r\nlooking out for whales. When sailing among much drift-ice, as seen\r\nfrom the deck, it seems at a small distance impervious, although\r\nit may happen that scarcely any two pieces are connected; but from\r\nthe mast-head, the relative position of almost every piece may be\r\ndistinctly seen, and an opinion may be formed by the experienced\r\nobserver of the probable and actual movements of such pieces as\r\nthe ship is required to pass. This is an object of the greatest\r\nimportance, because the varied movements of the different pieces\r\noccasion such an alteration in the channel pursued, that, were it not\r\nfor a constant, attentive, and judicious watch by the master or an\r\nable officer, a ship would not pass through any crowded collection of\r\ndrift-ice without the imminent risk of being stove.\r\n\r\nIn difficult situations, a master’s presence at the mast-head is\r\nsometimes required for many hours in succession, when the temperature\r\nof the air is from 10° to 20° below the freezing point, or more.\r\nIt is therefore necessary for the preservation of his health, as\r\nwell as for his comfort, that he should be sheltered from the\r\npiercing gale. A piece of canvas tied round the head of the main\r\ntop-mast, and heel of the top-gallant mast, extending only from\r\nthe cap to the cross-trees, or at best, a canvas stretched round\r\nthe base of the top-gallant rigging, but open on the after-part,\r\nwas the most complete contrivance of a crow’s nest, until a few\r\nyears ago my father invented an apparatus, having the appearance of\r\na rostrum, which afforded an admirable defence against the wind.\r\nThis contrivance, from the comfortable shelter it affords to the\r\nnavigator, having come into very general use, it may not be improper\r\nto describe it more particularly.\r\n\r\nThe one most approved by the inventor is about four and a half feet\r\nin length, and two and a half in diameter. The form is cylindrical,\r\nopen above and close below. It is composed of laths of wood, placed\r\nin a perpendicular position, round the exterior edge of a strong\r\nwooden hoop, forming the top, and round a plane of mahogany or\r\nother wood which forms the bottom, and the whole circumference of\r\nthe cylinder is covered with canvas or leather. The entrance is\r\nby a trap-hatch at the bottom. It is fixed on the very summit of\r\nthe main top-gallant mast, from whence the prospect on every side\r\nis unimpeded. On the after-side is a seat, with a place beneath\r\nfor a flag. In other parts are receptacles for a speaking-trumpet,\r\ntelescope, and occasionally for a rifle-piece, with utensils for\r\nloading. For the more effectual shelter of the observer, when in\r\nan erect posture, a movable screen is applied to the top on the\r\nwindward side, which increases the height so much as effectually to\r\nshield his head. When the ship is tacked, nothing more is necessary\r\nfor retaining the complete shelter than shifting the screen to the\r\nopposite side, which is done in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland ships usually leave Shetland towards the end of March,\r\nor the beginning of April. From thence, if their view be to avail\r\nthemselves of the benefit of the seal-fishery, they steer to the\r\nnorthward, on the meridian, or a little to the westward, and commonly\r\nmake the ice in the latitude of 70° to 72° north. But if the month\r\nof April be much advanced before they leave Shetland, they generally\r\nsteer for the whaling-stations on a course to the east of north, with\r\nthe view of falling into that remarkable indentation of the Polar\r\nice, lying in 5° or 10° east longitude, which I have denominated\r\nthe “Whale-Fishers’ Bight.” It used to be the practice to remain on\r\nsealing-stations until the beginning of May, and not to enter the ice\r\nuntil about the middle of the month; but of late it has become usual\r\nto push into the ice at a much earlier period, though the practice\r\nis neither without its dangers nor disadvantages. If a barrier of\r\nice prevents the fisher from reaching the usual fishing-station, he\r\nsometimes perseveres in search of whales on the southward margin of\r\nthe ice, but more generally endeavours to push through it into an\r\nopening, which is usually formed on the west side of Spitzbergen, in\r\nthe month of May, where he seldom fails of meeting with the objects\r\nof his search. It is a common remark, that the more difficulty there\r\nis attending the passage through the ice, the better is the fishery\r\nwhen that passage is accomplished. In close seasons, very few ships\r\npass the barrier before the middle or end of May. Those which first\r\nsucceed immediately proceed along the edge of the western ice to\r\nthe latitude of 78° or 79°, until they meet with whales. But in\r\nopen seasons, the most recommendable plan is to sail direct to the\r\nlatitude of 80°, when it can be accomplished at a very early period,\r\nwhere large whales are generally at this season to be found.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet ascertained what is the earliest period of the year in\r\nwhich it is possible to fish for whales. The danger attending the\r\nnavigation amidst massive drift-ice, in the obscurity of night, is\r\nthe most formidable objection against attempting the fishery before\r\nthe middle of the month of April, when the sun, having entered the\r\nnorthern tropic, begins to enlighten the Polar regions throughout the\r\ntwenty-four hours. Some ships have sailed to the northward of the\r\n78th degree of latitude, before the close of the month of March; but\r\nI am not acquainted with a single instance where the hardy fishers\r\nhave, at this season, derived any compensation for the extraordinary\r\ndangers to which they were exposed. In the course of the month of\r\nApril, on certain occasions, considerable progress has been made in\r\nthe fishery, notwithstanding the frequency of storms. At the first\r\nstage of the business, in open seas, the whales are usually found in\r\nmost abundance on the borders of the ice, near Hackluyt’s Headland,\r\nin the latitude of 80°. A degree or two further south they are\r\nsometimes seen, though not in much plenty; but in the 76th degree\r\nthey sometimes occur in such numbers, as to present a tolerable\r\nprospect of success in assailing them.\r\n\r\nSome rare instances have occurred wherein they have been seen on the\r\nedge of the ice, extending from Cherie Island to Point Look-out, in\r\nthe early part of the season. Grown fish are frequently found at the\r\nedge, or a little within the edge, of the loose ice, in the 79th\r\ndegree of north latitude, in the month of May; and small whales,\r\nof different ages, at fields, and sometimes in bays of the ice, in\r\nthe 80th degree. Usually the fish are most plentiful in June, and,\r\non some occasions, they are met with in every degree of latitude\r\nfrom 75° to 80°. In this month, the large whales are found in every\r\nvariety of situation; sometimes in open water, at others in the loose\r\nice, or at the edges of fields and floes, near the main impervious\r\nbody of ice, extending towards the coast of West Greenland. The\r\nsmaller animals of the species are, at the same time, found further\r\nto the south than in the spring, at floes, fields, or even among\r\nloose ice, but most plentifully about fields or floes, at the border\r\nof the main western ice, in the latitude of 78° or 78½°. In July,\r\nthe fishery generally terminates, sometimes at the beginning of the\r\nmonth, at others, though more rarely, it continues throughout the\r\ngreater part of it. Few small fish are seen at this season.\r\n\r\nThe parallel of 78° to 78½° is, on the whole, the most productive\r\nfishing-station. The interval between this parallel and 80°, or any\r\nother situation more remote, is called the “northward,” and any\r\nsituation in a lower latitude than 78° is called the “southward.”\r\nThough the 79th degree affords whales in the greatest abundance,\r\nyet the 76th degree affords them, perhaps, more generally. In this\r\nlatter situation a very large kind of the mysticetus is commonly\r\nto be found, throughout the season, from April to July inclusive.\r\nTheir number, however, is not often great; and as the situation in\r\nwhich they occur is unsheltered, and, consequently, exposed to heavy\r\nswells, the southern fishery is not much frequented. The parallel\r\nof 77° to 77½° is considered a “dead latitude” by the fishers, but\r\noccasionally it affords whales also.\r\n\r\nFrom an attentive observation of facts, it would appear that\r\nvarious tribes of the mysticetus inhabit different regions, and\r\npursue various routes on their removal from the places where first\r\nseen. These tribes seem to be distinguished by a difference of age\r\nor manners, and, in some instances, apparently by one of species\r\nor subspecies. The systematical movements of the whales receive\r\nillustration from many well-known facts. Sometimes a large tribe,\r\npassing from one place to another, which, under such circumstances,\r\nis denominated a “run of fish,” has been traced in its movements, in\r\na direct line from the south towards the north, along the seaward\r\nedge of the western ice, through a space of two or three degrees\r\nof latitude; then it has been ascertained to have entered the ice,\r\nand penetrated to the northward beyond the reach of the fishers. In\r\ncertain years, it is curious to observe, that the whales commence a\r\nsimultaneous retreat throughout the whole fishing limits, and all\r\ndisappear within the space of a very few days.\r\n\r\nHaving now mentioned, generally, the principal places resorted to by\r\nthe whales in the Spitzbergen seas, it will, possibly, be interesting\r\nto such as are in any way concerned in the fishery, to notice more\r\ndistinctly their favourite haunts under particular circumstances.\r\n\r\nExperience proves that the whale has its favourite places of resort,\r\ndepending on a sufficiency of food, particular circumstances of\r\nweather, and particular portions and qualities of the ice. Thus,\r\nthough many whales may have been seen in open water when the weather\r\nwas fine, after the occurrence of a storm perhaps not one is to be\r\nseen; and, though fields are sometimes the resort of hundreds of\r\nwhales, yet, whenever the loose ice around separates entirely away,\r\nthe whales quit them also. Hence, fields seldom afford whales in much\r\nabundance, excepting at the time when they first “break out,” and\r\nbecome accessible; that is, immediately after a vacancy is made on\r\nsome side by the separation of adjoining fields, floes, or drift-ice.\r\nWhales are rarely seen in abundance in the large open spaces of\r\nwater which sometimes occur amidst fields and floes, nor are they\r\ncommonly seen in a very open pack, unless it be in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the main western ice. They seem to have a preference\r\nfor close packs and patches of ice, and for fields under certain\r\ncircumstances; for deep bays, or _bights_, and sometimes for clear\r\nwater situations; occasionally for detached streams of drift-ice,\r\nand most generally for extensive sheets of bay-ice. Bay-ice is a\r\nfavourite retreat of the whales, so long as it continues sufficiently\r\ntender to be conveniently broken for the purpose of respiration. In\r\nsuch situations, whales may frequently be seen in amazing numbers,\r\nelevating and breaking the ice with their crowns, the eminences on\r\ntheir heads in which their blow-holes are situated.\r\n\r\nThe most favourable opportunity for prosecuting the fishery commonly\r\noccurs with north, north-west, or west winds. At such times, the\r\nsea near the ice is almost always smooth, and the atmosphere,\r\nthough cloudy and dark, is generally free from fog or thick snow.\r\nThe fishers prefer a cloudy to a clear sky, because, in very bright\r\nweather, the sea becomes illuminated, and the shadows of the\r\nwhale-boats are so deeply impressed in the water by the beams of the\r\nsun, that the whales are very apt to take the alarm, and evade the\r\nutmost care and skill of their pursuers. South-east or east winds,\r\nthough disagreeable, cause a violent agitation of the pieces of ice,\r\nand so annoy the whales as to induce them to leave their retreat\r\nand appear in the open sea. Although the fishery requires a cloudy\r\natmosphere, yet it must be free from fog or continued snow; smooth\r\nwater, with a breeze of wind, and navigably open, or perfectly solid\r\nice.\r\n\r\nThe boats and principal instruments employed in the capture of\r\nthe whale next claim a description. Whale-boats are, of course,\r\npeculiarly adapted for the occupation they are intended to be\r\nemployed in. A well-constructed Greenland boat possesses the\r\nfollowing properties:—It floats lightly and safely on the water, is\r\ncapable of being rowed with great speed, and readily turned round;\r\nit is of such capacity, that it carries six or seven men, seven or\r\neight hundred weight of whale-line, and various other materials,\r\nand yet retains the necessary properties of safety, buoyancy,\r\nand speed, either in smooth water, or where it is exposed to a\r\nconsiderable sea. Whale-boats, being very liable to receive damage,\r\nboth from whales and ice, are always carver-built—a structure which\r\nis easily repaired. They are usually of the following dimensions.\r\nThose called six-oared boats, adapted for carrying seven men, six of\r\nwhom, including the harpooner, are rowers, are generally twenty-six\r\nto twenty-eight feet in length, and about five feet nine inches in\r\nbreadth. Six-men boats, that is, with five rowers and a steersman,\r\nare usually twenty-five to twenty-six feet in length, and about\r\nfive feet three inches in breadth; and four-oared boats are usually\r\ntwenty-three to twenty-four feet in length, and about five feet,\r\nthree inches in breadth. The main breadth of the two first classes of\r\nboats is at about three-sevenths of the length of the boat, reckoned\r\nfrom the stern; but in the last class it is necessary to have the\r\nmain breadth within one-third of the length of the boat from the\r\nstern. The object of this is to enable the smaller boat to support,\r\nwithout being dragged under water, as great a strain on the lines\r\nas those of a larger class; otherwise, if such a boat were sent out\r\nby itself, its lines would be always liable to be lost before any\r\nassistance could reach it.\r\n\r\nThe five-oared or six-men boat is that which is in general use;\r\nthough each fishing-ship generally carries one or two of the largest\r\nclass. These boats are now commonly built of fir boards, one-half or\r\nthree-fourths of an inch thick, with timbers, keel, gunwales, stern,\r\nand stern-post of oak. An improvement in the timbering of whale-boats\r\nhas lately been made, by sawing the timber out of very straight\r\ngrained oak, and bending them to the required form after being made\r\nsupple by the application of steam, or immersion in boiling water.\r\nThis improvement, which renders the timbers more elastic than when\r\nthey are sawn out of crooked oak, and at the same time makes the\r\nboat stronger and lighter, was suggested by Thomas Brodrick, esq.,\r\nof Whitby, ship-builder. Though the principle has long been acted\r\nupon in clincher-built boats, with ash timbers, the application to\r\ncarver-built whale-boats is, I believe, new. The bow and stern of\r\nGreenland boats are both sharp, and in appearance very similar,\r\nbut the stern forms a more acute angle than the bow. The keel has\r\nsome depression in the middle from which the facility of turning is\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nThe instruments of general use in the capture of the whale are the\r\nharpoon and the lance. The harpoon is an instrument of iron, of about\r\nthree feet in length. It consists of three conjoined parts, called\r\nthe “socket,” “shank,” and “mouth,” the latter of which includes the\r\nbarbs or “withers.” This instrument, if we except a small addition\r\nto the barbs and some enlargement of dimensions, maintains the same\r\nform in which it was originally used in the fishery two centuries\r\nago. At that time, the mouth or barbed extremity was of a triangular\r\nshape, united at the shank in the middle of one of the sides, and\r\nthis being scooped out on each side of the shank formed two simple\r\nflat barbs. In the course of last century, an improvement was made by\r\nadding another small barb, resembling the beard of a fishhook, within\r\neach of the former withers in a reverse position. The two principal\r\nwithers in the present improved harpoon measure about eight inches in\r\nlength and six in breadth, the shank is eighteen inches to two feet\r\nin length, and four-tenths of an inch in diameter, and the socket,\r\nwhich is hollow, swells from the size of the shank to near two inches\r\ndiameter, and is about six inches in length. Now, when the harpoon\r\nis forced by a blow into the fat of the whale, and the line is held\r\ntight, the principal withers seize the strong ligamentous fibres of\r\nthe blubber, and prevent it from being withdrawn; and, in the event\r\nof its being pulled out so far as to remain entangled by one wither\r\nonly, which is frequently the case, then the little reversed barb,\r\nor “stop-wither,” as it is called, collecting a number of the same\r\nreticulated sinewy fibres, which are very numerous near the skin,\r\nprevents the harpoon from being shaken out by the ordinary motions of\r\nthe whale. The point and exterior edges of the barbs of the harpoon\r\nare sharpened to a rough edge by means of a file. This part of the\r\nharpoon is not formed of steel, as it is frequently represented, but\r\nof common soft iron, so that when blunted it can be readily sharpened\r\nby a file, or even by scraping it with a knife.\r\n\r\nThe most important part in the construction of this instrument is the\r\nshank. As this part is liable to be forcibly and suddenly extended,\r\ntwisted, and bent, it requires to be made of the softest and most\r\npliable iron. That kind which is of the most approved tenacity is\r\nmade of old horse-shoe nails or _stubs_, which are formed into small\r\nrods, and two or three of these welded together, so that should a\r\nflaw happen to occur in any one of the rods, the strength of the\r\nwhole might still be depended on. Some manufacturers inclose a\r\nquantity of stub-iron in a cylinder of best foreign iron, and form\r\nthe shank of the harpoon out of a single rod. A test, sometimes used\r\nfor trying the sufficiency of a harpoon, is to wind its shank round a\r\nbolt of inch-iron, in the form of a close spiral, then to unwind it\r\nagain, and put it into a straight form. It bears this without injury\r\nin the cold state, it is considered as excellent. The breaking of a\r\nharpoon is of no less importance than the value of a whale, which is\r\nsometimes estimated at more than £1000 sterling. This consideration\r\nhas induced many ingenious persons to turn their attention towards\r\nimproving the construction and security of this instrument, but\r\nthough various alterations have been suggested, such as forming the\r\nshank of wire, adding one or two lateral barbs, etc., etc., they have\r\nall given place to the simplicity of the ancient harpoon.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the harpoon is the lance, which is a spear\r\nof iron of the length of six feet. It consists of a hollow socket,\r\nsix inches long, swelling from half an inch, the size of the shank,\r\nto near two inches in diameter, into which is fitted a four feet\r\nstock or handle of fir; a shank, five feet long and half an inch\r\nin diameter; and a mouth of steel, which is made very thin, and\r\nexceedingly sharp, seven or eight inches in length, and two or two\r\nand a half in breadth. Besides these instruments, there is also the\r\nharpoon gun. It was invented in the year 1731, and used by some\r\nindividuals with success. Being however difficult, and somewhat\r\ndangerous in its application, it was laid aside for many years.\r\nIn 1771 or 1772, a new one was produced to the Society of Arts,\r\nand received as an original invention. Between 1772 and 1792, the\r\nSociety expended large sums in premiums to whale-fishers and to\r\nartisans for improvements in the gun and harpoon. Since 1792, they\r\nhave generally been in the habit of offering a premium of ten guineas\r\nto the harpooner who should shoot the greatest number of whales\r\nin one season, not being less than three. This premium, however,\r\nthough it has been frequently offered, has been seldom claimed. In\r\nits present improved form, as made by Mr. Wallis, gunsmith, Hull,\r\nthe harpoon-gun consists of a kind of swivel, having a barrel\r\nof wrought-iron 24 or 26 inches in length, of 3 inches exterior\r\ndiameter, and 1⅞ inches bore. It is furnished with two locks, which\r\nact simultaneously, for the purpose of diminishing the liability of\r\nthe gun missing fire. The shank of the harpoon is double, terminating\r\nin a cylindrical knob, fitting the bore of the gun. Between the two\r\nparts of the shank is a wire ring, to which is attached the line.\r\nNow, when the harpoon is introduced into the barrel of the gun, the\r\nring with the attached line remains on the outside near the mouth\r\nof the harpoon, but the instant that it is fired, the ring flies\r\nback against the cylindrical knob. The harpoon-gun has been rendered\r\ncapable of throwing a harpoon near forty yards with effect, yet, on\r\naccount of the difficulty in the management of it, it has not been\r\nvery generally adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the outward passage, the different utensils are\r\nfitted for immediate use. One preparation is that which is known\r\nby the name of “spanning harpoons.” A piece of rope, of the best\r\nhemp, called a “fore-ganger,” about two and a quarter inches in\r\ncircumference, and eight or nine yards in length, is spliced closely\r\nround the shank of the harpoon, the swelled socket of which prevents\r\nthe eye of the _splice_ from being drawn off. A stock, or handle, six\r\nor seven feet in length, is then fitted into the socket, and fastened\r\nin its place through the medium of the fore-ganger. The fastening of\r\nthe stock is sufficient only for retaining it firm in its situation\r\nduring the discharge of the weapon, but is liable to be disengaged\r\nsoon afterwards; on which the harpoon, relieved from the shake and\r\ntwist of this no longer necessary appendage, maintains its hold with\r\nbetter effect. After the stock drops out, it is seldom lost, but\r\nstill hangs on the line by means of a loop of cord, fixed openly\r\nround it, for the purpose of preventing the stock from floating\r\naway. Every harpoon is stamped with the name of the ship to which it\r\nbelongs; and when prepared for use, a private mark, containing the\r\nname of the ship and master, with the date of the year written upon\r\nleather, is concealed beneath some rope-yarns, wound round the socket\r\nof the instrument, and the same is sometimes introduced also into the\r\nfore-ganger. These marks serve to identify the harpoons, when any\r\ndispute happens to arise relative to the claims of different ships\r\nto the same fish and have sometimes proved of essential service\r\nin deciding cases which might otherwise have extended to vexatious\r\nlitigations.\r\n\r\nA harpoon thus prepared, with fore-ganger and stock, is said to be\r\n“spanned in.” In this state, the point or mouth, being very clean\r\nand sharp, is preserved in the same condition by a shield of oiled\r\npaper or canvas; and the instrument, with its appendages, laid up in\r\na convenient place, ready for being attached to the whale-line in a\r\nboat when wanted.\r\n\r\nThe principal preparations for commencing the fishery are included\r\nin the “fitting of the boats.” In this work all the people belonging\r\nto the ship are employed. The boats are first cleared of all lumber,\r\nand then the whale-lines, each consisting of 120 fathoms of rope,\r\nabout two and a quarter inches in circumference, are spliced to each\r\nother, to the amount of about six to each boat, the united length of\r\nwhich is about 720 fathoms, or 4,320 feet; and the whole carefully\r\nand beautifully coiled in compartments in the boat prepared for the\r\npurpose. A portion of five or six fathoms of the line first put into\r\nthe boat, called the “stray-line,” is left uncovered by that which\r\nfollows, and coiled by itself in a small compartment at the stern of\r\nthe boat: it is furnished with a loop or “eye,” for the facility of\r\nconnecting the lines of one boat with those of another. To the upper\r\nend of the line is spliced the fore-ganger of a spanned harpoon, thus\r\nconnecting the harpoon with all the lines in the boat.\r\n\r\nEvery boat completely fitted is furnished with two harpoons (one\r\nspare,) six or eight lances, and five to seven oars, together with\r\nthe following instruments and apparatus:—A “jack,” or flag, fastened\r\nto a pole, intended to be displayed as a signal, whenever a whale\r\nis harpooned; a “tail-knife,” used for perforating the fins or tail\r\nof a dead whale; a “mik,” or rest, made of wood, for supporting the\r\nstock of the harpoon when ready for instant service; an “axe,” for\r\ncutting the line when necessary; a “pigging,” or small bucket, for\r\nbailing the boat or wetting the running lines; a “snatch-block;”\r\na “grapnel;” two “boat-hooks;” a “fid;” a wooden “mallet,” and\r\n“snow-shovel;” also, a small broom and a “swab,” together with spare\r\ntholes, grommets, etc. In addition to these, the two six-oared or\r\nother swiftest boats are likewise furnished with an apparatus,\r\ncalled a “winch,” for heaving the lines into the boat after the\r\nfish is either killed or has made his escape; and in some ships\r\nthey also carry a harpoon-gun, and apparatus for loading. The whole\r\nof the articles above enumerated are disposed in convenient places\r\nthroughout the boat. The axe is always placed within the reach of\r\nthe harpooner, who, in case of an accident, can cut the line in an\r\ninstant; the harpoon-gun is fixed by its swivel to the boat’s stern;\r\nthe lances are laid in the sides of the boat, upon the thwarts; the\r\nhand-harpoon is placed upon the mik, or rest, with its stock, and on\r\nthe bow of the boat with its point, and the fore-ganger is clearly\r\ncoiled beneath it, so that the harpoon can be taken up and discharged\r\nin a moment. An oar is used for steering, in preference to a rudder,\r\nin consequence of its possessing many advantages: an oar does not\r\nretard the velocity of the boat so much as a rudder; it is capable\r\nof turning the boat when in a state of rest, and more readily than a\r\nrudder when in motion; and it can be used for propelling the boat in\r\nnarrow places of the ice, where the rowers cannot ply their oars, by\r\nthe process of sculling, and in calms for approaching a whale without\r\nnoise, by the same operation.\r\n\r\nThe crew of a whale-ship are separated into divisions, equal in\r\nnumber to the number of the boats. Each division, consisting of a\r\nharpooner, a boat-steerer, and a line-manager, together with three\r\nor four rowers, constitutes a boat’s crew. The harpooner’s principal\r\noffice is, as his name implies, to strike the whale, also to guide\r\nthe line, or to kill an entangled whale with his lances. When in\r\npursuit he rows the bow-oar. He has the command of the boat. The\r\nboat-steerer ranks next to the harpooner; he guides the course of\r\nthe boat, watches the motions of the whale pursued, intimates its\r\nmovements to the harpooner, and stimulates the crew to exertion by\r\nencouraging exclamations. The line-manager rows the “after-oar” in\r\nthe boat, and, conjointly with the boat-steerer, attends to the lines\r\nwhen in the act of running out or coiling in. The remainder of the\r\ncrew pull the oars. Besides these divisions of the seamen of a whaler\r\ninto boats’ crews, they are classed on the passages, and when no\r\nwhale-fishing is going on, as in other vessels, into watches.\r\n\r\nOn fishing-stations, when the weather is such as to render the\r\nfishery practicable, the boats are always ready for instant service,\r\nsuspended from davits, or cranes, by the sides of the ship, and\r\nfurnished with stores, as before enumerated; two boats at least,\r\nthe crews of which are always in readiness, can in general be\r\nmanned and lowered into the water within the space of one minute\r\nof time. “Wherever there is a probability of seeing whales, when\r\nthe weather and situation are such as to present a possibility of\r\ncapturing them, the “crow’s nest” is generally occupied by the\r\nmaster, or some one of the officers, who, commanding from thence\r\nan extensive prospect of the surrounding sea, keeps an anxious watch\r\nfor the appearance of a whale. Assisted by a telescope, he views\r\nthe operations of any ship which may be in sight at a distance; and\r\noccasionally sweeps the horizon with his glass, to extend the limited\r\nsphere of vision in which he is able to discriminate a whale with the\r\nnaked eye to an area vastly greater. The moment that a fish is seen,\r\nhe gives notice to the “watch upon deck,” part of whom leap into a\r\nboat, are lowered down, and push off towards the place. If the fish\r\nbe large, a second boat is immediately dispatched to the support of\r\nthe other. When the whale again appears, two boats row towards it\r\nwith their utmost speed, and though they may be disappointed in all\r\ntheir attempts, they generally continue the pursuit until the fish\r\neither takes the alarm and escapes, or they are recalled by a signal\r\nto the ship. When two or more fishes appear at the same time in\r\ndifferent situations, the number of boats sent in pursuit is commonly\r\nincreased. When the whole of the boats are sent out, the ship is said\r\nto have “a loose fall.” During fine weather, when there is great\r\nprobability of finding whales, a boat is generally kept in readiness,\r\nmanned and afloat, sometimes towed by a rope astern, or, if the ship\r\nbe still, at a little distance. There are several rules observed\r\nin approaching a whale, as precautions, to prevent the animal from\r\ntaking the alarm. As the whale is dull of hearing, but quick of\r\nsight, the boat-steerer always endeavours to get behind it, and, in\r\naccomplishing this, he sometimes takes a circuitous route. In calm\r\nweather, when guns are not used, the greatest caution is necessary\r\nbefore a whale can be reached; smooth careful rowing is always\r\nrequisite, and sometimes sculling.\r\n\r\nWhen it is known that a whale seldom abides longer on the surface\r\nof the water than two minutes, that it generally remains from five\r\nto ten or fifteen minutes under water, that in this interval it\r\nsometimes moves through the space of half a mile or more, and that\r\nthe fisher has very rarely any certain intimation of the place in\r\nwhich it will reappear—the difficulty and address requisite to\r\napproach sufficiently near, during its short stay on the surface, to\r\nharpoon it, will be readily appreciated. It is, therefore, a primary\r\nconsideration with the harpooner always to place his boat as near\r\nas possible to the spot where he expects the fish to rise; and he\r\nconsiders himself successful in the attempt when the fish “comes up\r\nwithin a start,” that is, within the distance of about two hundred\r\nyards. A whale moving forward, at a small distance beneath the\r\nsurface of the sea, leaves a sure indication of its situation in what\r\nis called “an eddy,” having somewhat the resemblance of “the wake,”\r\nor track of a ship; and in fine calm weather, its change of position\r\nis sometimes pointed out by the birds, many of which closely follow\r\nit when at the surface, and hover over it when below, whose keener\r\nvision can discern it when it is totally concealed from human eye. By\r\nthese indications many whales have been taken.\r\n\r\nThe providence of God is manifested in the tameness and timidity of\r\nmany of the largest inhabitants of the earth and sea, whereby they\r\nfall victims to the prowess of man, and are rendered subservient to\r\nhis convenience in life. And this was the design of the lower animals\r\nin their creation, for God, when he made man, gave him “dominion over\r\nthe fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the\r\ncattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that\r\ncreepeth upon the earth.” The holy psalmist, when considering the\r\npower and goodness of God in the creation, exclaimed, “What is man,\r\nthat thou art mindful of him; and the son of man, that thou visitest\r\nhim?” And, in contemplation of the glory and honour put upon man by\r\nthe Almighty, in the power given him over created nature, he adds,\r\n“Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou\r\nhast put all things under his feet: ... the fowl of the air, and the\r\nfish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the\r\nseas. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!”\r\nHence, while we admire the cool and determined intrepidity of those\r\nwho successfully encounter the huge mysticetus, if we are led to\r\nreflect on the source of the power by which the strength of men is\r\nrendered effectual for the mighty undertaking, our reflections must\r\nlead us to the great First Cause as the only source from whence such\r\npower could be derived. If there be peril in the encounter between\r\nman and God’s most powerful creatures, how much more dangerous must\r\nbe the struggle between man and the Lord his Maker; and how certain,\r\nif it be prolonged, the terrible issue of such a contest! The power\r\nof the mighty monster of the deep, or even of the most glorious\r\narchangel, is as nothing in comparison with Him to whom power\r\nbelongeth, and who will overwhelm his adversaries with a fearful\r\nand final perdition. Now, however, there is no fury in him, and he\r\nis as condescending as he is powerful, entreating his rebellious\r\nsubjects to receive the peace of his reconciliation, and to draw near\r\nto him with a penitent and contrite heart, through the merit and\r\nintercession of his Son, in whom he assures us of a free and complete\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\nWhenever a whale lies on the surface of the water, unconscious of\r\nthe approach of its enemies, the hardy fisher rows directly upon it;\r\nand, an instant before the boat touches it, buries his harpoon in\r\nits back; but if, while the boat is at a little distance, the whale\r\nshould indicate its intention of diving, by lifting its head above\r\nits common level, and then plunging it under water, and raising its\r\nbody till it appears like a large segment of a sphere, the harpoon\r\nis thrown from the hand, or fired from a gun, the former of which\r\nmethods, when skilfully practised, is efficient at the distance of\r\neight or ten yards, and the latter at the distance of thirty yards,\r\nor upward. The wounded whale, in the surprise and agony of the\r\nmoment, makes a convulsive effort to escape. Then is the moment of\r\ndanger. The boat is subjected to the most violent blows from its\r\nhead or its fins, but particularly from its ponderous tail, which\r\nsometimes sweeps the air with such tremendous fury, that both boat\r\nand men are exposed to one common destruction.\r\n\r\nThe head of the whale is avoided, because it cannot be penetrated\r\nwith the harpoon; but any part of the body between the head and the\r\ntail will admit of the full length of the instrument, without danger\r\nof obstruction. The moment that the wounded whale disappears, or\r\nleaves the boat, a jack or flag, elevated on a staff, is displayed,\r\non sight of which those on watch in the ship give the alarm, by\r\nstamping on the deck, accompanied by a simultaneous and continuous\r\nshout of “a fall.” This word, derived from the Dutch language, is\r\nexpressive of the conduct of the sailors in jumping, dropping,\r\nfalling to man the boats on an occasion requiring extreme dispatch.\r\nAt this sound, the sleeping crew arouse, jump from their beds, rush\r\nupon deck, with their clothes tied by a string in their hands, and\r\ncrowd into the boats. With a temperature of zero, should a “fall”\r\noccur, the crew would appear on deck, shielded only by their drawers,\r\nstockings, and shirts, or other habiliments in which they sleep. They\r\ngenerally contrive to dress themselves in part, at least, as the\r\nboats are lowered down, but sometimes they push off in the state in\r\nwhich they rise from their beds, row away towards the “fast-boat,”\r\nand have no opportunity of clothing themselves for a length of time\r\nafterwards. The alarm of “a fall” has a singular effect on the\r\nfeelings of a sleeping person unaccustomed to the whale-fishing\r\nbusiness. It has often been mistaken as a cry of distress. A landsman\r\nin a Hull ship, seeing the crew on an occasion of a fall rush upon\r\ndeck, with their clothes in their hands, and leap into the boats,\r\nwhen there was no appearance of danger, thought the men were all mad;\r\nbut with another individual the effect was totally different. Alarmed\r\nwith the extraordinary noise, and still more so when he reached the\r\ndeck with the appearance of all the crew seated in the boats in their\r\nshirts, he imagined the ship was sinking. He therefore endeavoured to\r\nget into a boat himself; but every one of them being fully manned,\r\nhe was always repulsed. After several fruitless endeavours to gain\r\na place among his comrades, he cried out, with feelings of evident\r\ndistress, “What shall I do?—will none of you take me in?”\r\n\r\nThe first effort of a “fast-fish,” or whale that has been struck,\r\nis to escape from the boat by sinking under water. After this, it\r\npursues its course directly downward, or reappears at a little\r\ndistance, and swims with great celerity near the surface of the water\r\ntowards any neighbouring ice among which it may obtain an imaginary\r\nshelter; or it returns instantly to the surface, and gives evidence\r\nof its agony by the most convulsive throes, in which its fins and\r\ntail are alternately displayed in the air and dashed into the water\r\nwith tremendous violence. The former behaviour, however, that is, to\r\ndive towards the bottom of the sea, is so frequent in comparison\r\nof any other, that it may be considered as the general conduct of\r\na “fast-fish.” A whale, struck near the edge of any large sheet of\r\nice, and passing underneath it, will sometimes run the whole of the\r\nline out of one boat in the space of eight or ten minutes of time. To\r\nretard, therefore, as much as possible, the flight of the whale, and\r\nto secure the lines, it is usual for the harpooner to cast one, two,\r\nor more turns of the line round a kind of post, called a _bollard_,\r\nwhich is fixed within ten or twelve inches of the stern of the boat\r\nfor the purpose. Such is the friction of the line, when running round\r\nthe bollard, that it frequently envelopes the harpooner in smoke; and\r\nif the wood were not repeatedly wetted, would probably set fire to\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nDuring the capture of one whale, a groove is sometimes cut in the\r\nbollard, near an inch in depth, and were it not for a plate of\r\nbrass, iron, or a block of lignum vitæ, which covers the top of\r\nthe stern, where the line passes over, it is apprehended that the\r\naction of the line on the material of the boat would cut it down to\r\nthe water’s edge in the course of one season of successful fishing.\r\nThe approaching distress of a boat for want of line is indicated\r\nby the elevation of an oar in the way of a mast, to which is added\r\na second, a third, or even a fourth, in proportion to the nature\r\nof the exigence. The utmost care and attention are requisite on\r\nthe part of every person in the boat when the lines are running\r\nout, fatal consequences having been sometimes produced by the most\r\ntrifling neglect. On my first voyage to the whale-fishery, such an\r\naccident occurred. A thousand fathoms of line were already out, and\r\nthe fast-boat was forcibly pressed against the side of a piece of\r\nice. The harpooner, in his anxiety to retard the flight of the whale,\r\napplied too many turns of the line round the bollard, which, getting\r\nentangled, drew the boat beneath the ice. Another boat providentially\r\nwas at hand, into which the crew, including myself, who happened to\r\nbe present, had just time to escape. The whale, with near two miles\r\nlength of line, was, in consequence of the accident, lost.\r\n\r\nWhen fish have been struck by myself, I have, on different occasions,\r\nestimated their rate of descent. For the first 300 fathoms, the\r\naverage velocity was usually after the rate of eight to ten miles per\r\nhour. In one instance, the third line of 120 fathoms was run out in\r\nsixty-one seconds, that is, at the rate of 8·16 miles, or 7·18 nautical\r\nmiles, per hour. The average stay under water of a wounded whale,\r\nwhich steadily descends after being struck, according to the most\r\nusual conduct of the animal, is about thirty minutes. The longest\r\nstay I ever observed was fifty-six minutes; but in shallow water I\r\nhave been informed it has sometimes been known to remain an hour and\r\na half at the bottom after being struck, and yet has returned to\r\nthe surface alive. The greater the velocity, the more considerable\r\nthe distance to which it descends, and the longer the time it\r\nremains under water, so much greater in proportion is the extent of\r\nexhaustion, and the consequent facility of accomplishing its capture.\r\nImmediately that it reappears, the assisting boats make for the\r\nplace with their utmost speed, and as they reach it, each harpooner\r\nplunges his harpoon into its back, to the amount of three, four,\r\nor more, according to the size of the whale and the nature of the\r\nsituation. Most frequently, however, it descends for a few minutes\r\nafter receiving the second harpoon, and obliges the other boats to\r\nawait its return to the surface before any attack can be made. It\r\nis afterwards actively plied with lances, which are thrust into its\r\nbody, aiming at its vitals. At length, when exhausted by numerous\r\nwounds and the loss of blood, which flows from the huge animal in\r\ncopious streams, it indicates the approach of its dissolution by\r\ndischarging from its “blow-holes” a mixture of blood along with the\r\nair and mucus which it usually expires, and finally jets of blood.\r\nThe sea to a great extent around is dyed with its blood, and the\r\nice-boats and men are sometimes drenched with the same. Its track is\r\nlikewise marked by a broad pellicle of oil, which exudes from his\r\nwounds, and appears on the surface of the sea. Its final capture is\r\nsometimes preceded by a convulsive and energetic struggle, in which\r\nits tail, reared, whirled, and violently jerked in the air, resounds\r\nto the distance of miles. In dying, it turns on its back, or on its\r\nside, which joyful circumstance is announced by the capturers with\r\nthe striking of their flags, accompanied with three lively huzzas.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable exhaustion observed on the first appearance of a\r\nwounded whale at the surface, after a descent of 700 or 800 fathoms\r\nperpendicular, does not depend on the nature of the wound it has\r\nreceived, for a hundred superficial wounds received from harpoons\r\ncould not have the effect of a single lance penetrating the vitals,\r\nbut is the effect of the almost incredible pressure to which the\r\nanimal must have been exposed. The surface of the body of a large\r\nwhale may be considered as comprising an area of 1,540 square feet.\r\nThis, under the common weight of the atmosphere alone, must sustain\r\na pressure of 3,104,640 lbs., or 1,386 tons. But at the depth of 800\r\nfathoms, where there is a column of water equal in weight to about\r\n154 atmospheres, the pressure on the animal must be equal to 211,200\r\ntons. This is a degree of pressure of which we can have but an\r\nimperfect conception. It may assist our comprehension, however, to be\r\ninformed, that it exceeds in weight sixty of the largest ships of the\r\nBritish navy, when manned, provisioned, and fitted for a six months’\r\ncruise.\r\n\r\nBy the motions of the fast-boat, the movements of the whale are\r\nestimated. Every fast-boat carries a flag, and the ship to which\r\nsuch boats belong also wears a flag, until the whale is either killed\r\nor makes its escape. These signals serve to indicate to surrounding\r\nships the exclusive title of the fast-ship to the entangled whale,\r\nand to prevent their interference, excepting in the way of assistance\r\nin the capture.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the length of time requisite for capturing a whale,\r\nit may be remarked that this greatly depends on the activity of\r\nthe harpooners, the favourableness of situation and weather, and\r\non the peculiar conduct of the whale attacked. I have myself\r\nwitnessed the capture of a large whale in twenty-eight minutes, and\r\nhave also been engaged with another fish, which was lost, after it\r\nhad been entangled about sixteen hours. Under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, the average length of time occupied in the capture\r\nof a whale may be stated as not exceeding an hour, and the general\r\naverage, including all sizes of fish and all circumstances of\r\ncapture, may probably be two or three hours. The mode described\r\nin the preceding pages of conducting the fishery for whales under\r\nfavourable circumstances, may be considered as the general plan\r\npursued by the fishers of all ports of Britain, as well as of those\r\nof other nations who resort to Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which some whales are subdued, and the slightness of\r\nthe entanglement by which they are taken, are truly surprising;\r\nbut, with others, it is equally astonishing, that neither line nor\r\nharpoon, nor any number of each, is sufficiently strong to effect\r\ntheir capture. Whales have even been taken in consequence of the\r\nentanglement of a line, without any harpoon at all; though, when\r\nsuch a case has occurred, it has evidently been the result of\r\naccident. A harpooner belonging to the Prince of Brazils, of Hull,\r\nhad struck a small fish. It descended, and remained for some time\r\nquiet, and at length appeared to be drowned. The strain on the line\r\nbeing then considerable, it was taken to the ship’s capstern, with\r\na view of heaving the fish up. The force requisite for performing\r\nthis operation was extremely various; sometimes the line came in\r\nwith ease, at others, a quantity was withdrawn with great force and\r\nrapidity. As such, it appeared evident that the fish was yet alive.\r\nThe heaving, however, was persisted in, and after the greater part\r\nof the lines had been drawn on board, a dead fish appeared at the\r\nsurface, secured by several turns of the line round its body. It was\r\ndisentangled with difficulty, and was confidently believed to be the\r\nwhale that had been struck. But when the line was cleared from the\r\nfish, it proved to be merely the “bight,” for the end still hung\r\nperpendicularly downward. What was then the surprise to find that\r\nit was still pulled away with considerable force! The capstern was\r\nagain resorted to, and shortly afterwards they hove up, also dead,\r\nthe fish originally struck, with the harpoon still fast. Hence, it\r\nappeared that the fish first drawn up had got accidentally entangled\r\nwith the line, and, in its struggles to escape, had still further\r\ninvolved itself, by winding the line repeatedly round its body. The\r\nfish first entangled, as was suspected, had long been dead, but it\r\nwas this interloper that occasioned the jerks and other singular\r\neffects observed on the line.\r\n\r\nThe method already described is that which is adopted for the capture\r\nof whales under the most favourable circumstances, and is subject to\r\nmany alterations when the situation or circumstances are peculiar.\r\nHence arise various modes of capturing the whale, which furnish\r\nabundant opportunities for the exercise of ingenuity and skill, and\r\nare attended by their peculiar dangers. To an enumeration of these\r\nvarious methods, according to local circumstances, we now proceed to\r\ndirect the reader’s attention.\r\n\r\n1. _Pack-fishing._—The borders of close packs of drift-ice are\r\nfrequently a favourite resort of large whales. To attack them in\r\nsuch a situation subjects the fisher to great risks in his lines and\r\nboats, as well as uncertainty in effecting their capture. When a\r\nconsiderable swell prevails on the borders of the ice, the whales,\r\non being struck, will sometimes recede from the pack, and become\r\nthe prize of their assailers; but most generally they flee to it\r\nfor shelter, and frequently make their escape. To guard against the\r\nloss of lines as much as possible, it is usual either to strike two\r\nharpoons from different boats at the same moment, or to bridle the\r\nlines of a second boat upon those of the boat from which the fish is\r\nstruck. This operation consists in fixing other lines to those of the\r\nfast-boat, at some distance from the harpoon, so that there is only\r\none harpoon and one line immediately attached to the fish, but the\r\ndouble strength of a line from the place of their junction to the\r\nboats. Hence, should the fish flee directly into the ice, and proceed\r\nto an inaccessible distance, the two boats bearing an equal strain on\r\neach of their lines can at pleasure draw the harpoon, or break the\r\nsingle part of the line immediately connected with it, and in either\r\ncase secure themselves against any considerable loss.\r\n\r\nWhen a pack, from its closeness, prevents boats from penetrating,\r\nthe men travel over the ice, leaping from piece to piece, in pursuit\r\nof the entangled whale. In this pursuit they carry lances with them,\r\nand sometimes harpoons, with which, whenever they can approach the\r\nfish, they attack it; and if they succeed in killing it, they drag it\r\ntowards the exterior margin of the ice, by means of the line fastened\r\nto the harpoon with which it was originally struck. In such cases,\r\nit is generally an object of importance to sink it beneath the ice;\r\nfor effecting which purpose, each lobe of the tail is divided from\r\nthe body, excepting a small portion of the edge, from which it hangs\r\npendulous in the water. If it still floats, bags of sand, kedges,\r\nor small cannon, are suspended by a block on the bight of the line,\r\nwherewith the buoyancy of the dead whale is usually overcome. It then\r\nsinks, and is easily hauled out by the line into the open sea.\r\n\r\nTo particularize all the variety of pack-fishing, arising from wind\r\nand weather, size of the fish, state and peculiarities of the ice,\r\netc., would require more space than the interest of the subject to\r\ngeneral readers would justify. I shall therefore only remark, that\r\npack-fishing is, on the whole, the most troublesome and dangerous\r\nof all others; that instances have occurred of fish having been\r\nentangled during forty or fifty hours, and escaped after all; and\r\nthat other instances are remembered, of ships having lost the greater\r\npart of their stock of lines, several of their boats, and sometimes,\r\nthough happily less commonly, some individuals of their crews.\r\n\r\n2. _Field-fishing._—The fishery for whales, when conducted at the\r\nmargin of those wonderful sheets of solid ice, called fields, is,\r\nwhen the weather is fine, and the refuge for ships secure, the most\r\nagreeable, and sometimes the most productive of all situations which\r\nthe fishery of Greenland presents. A fish struck at the margin of a\r\nlarge field of ice generally descends obliquely beneath it, takes\r\nfour or eight lines from the fast-boat, and then returns exhausted\r\nto the edge. It is then attacked in the usual way with harpoons\r\nand lances, and is easily killed. There is one evident advantage\r\nin field-fishing, which is this: when the fast-boat lies at the\r\nedge of a firm unbroken field, and the line proceeds in an angle\r\nbeneath the ice, the fish must necessarily arise somewhere in a\r\nsemicircle described from the fast-boat as a centre, with a sweep\r\nnot exceeding the length of the lines out; but most generally it\r\nappears in a line extending along the margin of the ice, so that\r\nthe boats, when dispersed along the edge of the field, are as\r\neffectual and as ready for promoting the capture as twice the number\r\nof boats or more when fishing in open situations; because, in open\r\nsituations, the whale may arise anywhere within a circle, instead of\r\na semicircle, described by the length of the lines withdrawn from\r\nthe fast-boat, whence it frequently happens that all the attendant\r\nboats are disposed in a wrong direction, and the fish recovers its\r\nbreath, breaks loose, and escapes before any of them can secure it\r\nwith a second harpoon. Hence, when a ship fishes at a field with an\r\nordinary crew and six or seven boats, two of the largest fish may\r\nbe struck at the same time with every prospect of success; while\r\nthe same force attempting the capture of two at once in an open\r\nsituation, will not unfrequently occasion the loss of both. There\r\nhave, indeed, been many instances of a ship’s crew, with seven\r\nboats, striking at a field six fish at the same time, and succeeding\r\nin killing the whole; generally speaking, six boats at a field are\r\ncapable of performing the same execution as near twice that number\r\nin open situations. Besides, fields sometimes afford an opportunity\r\nof fishing, when in any other situation there can be little or no\r\nprobability of success, or, indeed, when to fish elsewhere is utterly\r\nimpracticable. Thus, calms, storms, and fogs, are great annoyances in\r\nthe fishery in general, and frequently prevent it altogether, but at\r\nfields the fishery goes on under any of these disadvantages. As there\r\nare several important advantages attending the fishery at fields,\r\nso likewise there are some serious disadvantages, chiefly relating\r\nto the safety of the ships engaged in the occupation. The motions\r\nof fields are rapid, various, and unaccountable, and the power with\r\nwhich they approach each other, and squeeze every resisting object,\r\nimmense; hence occasionally vast mischief is produced, which it is\r\nnot always in the power of the most skilful and attentive master to\r\nforesee or prevent.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal advantages and disadvantages of fields of ice\r\nto the whale-fishery. The advantages, however, as above enumerated,\r\nthough they extend to large floes, do not extend to small floes,\r\nor to such fields, how large soever they may be, as contain cracks\r\nor holes, or are filled up with thin ice in the interior. Large\r\nand firm fields are the most convenient, and likewise the most\r\nadvantageous for the fishery; the most convenient, because the\r\nwhales, unable to breathe beneath a close extensive field of ice,\r\nare obliged to make their appearance again above water among the\r\nboats on the look out; and they are the most advantageous, because\r\nnot only the most fish commonly resort to them, but a greater number\r\ncan be killed with less force, and in a shorter space of time, than\r\nin any other situation. Thin fields, or fields full of holes, being\r\nby no means advantageous to fish by, are usually avoided, because a\r\n“fast fish” retreating under such a field, can respire through the\r\nholes in the centre as conveniently as on the exterior; and a large\r\nfish usually proceeds from one hole to another, and if determined\r\nto advance, cannot possibly be stopped. In this case, all that can\r\nbe done is, to break the line or draw the harpoon out. But when the\r\nfish can be observed blowing in any of the holes in a field, the men\r\ntravel over the ice, and attack it with lances, pricking it over the\r\nnose to endeavour to turn it back. This scheme, however, does not\r\nalways answer the expectations of the fishers, as frequently the fear\r\nof his enemies acts so powerfully on the whale that he pushes forward\r\ntowards the interior to his dying moment. When killed, the same\r\nmeans are used as in pack-fishing to sink it, but they do not always\r\nsucceed; for the harpoon is frequently drawn out, or the line broken\r\nin the effort. If, therefore, no attempt to sink the fish avails,\r\nthere is scarcely any other practicable method of making a prize of\r\nit, (unless when the ice happens to be so thin that it can be broken\r\nwith a boat, or a channel readily cut in it with an ice-saw,) than\r\ncutting the blubber away, and dragging it piece by piece across the\r\nice to the vessel, which requires immense labour, and is attended\r\nwith vast loss of time. Hence we have a sufficient reason for\r\navoiding such situations, whenever fish can be found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs connected with this subject, I cannot pass over a circumstance\r\nwhich occurred within my own observation, and which excited my\r\nhighest admiration. On the 8th July, 1813, the ship Esk lay by the\r\nedge of a thin sheet of ice, in which were several thin parts and\r\nsome holes. Here a fish being heard blowing, a harpoon, having a\r\nline connected with it, was conveyed across the ice by a boat on\r\nguard, and the harpooner succeeded in striking the whale, at the\r\ndistance of 350 yards from the verge. It dragged out ten lines,\r\n(2,400 yards,) and was supposed to be seen blowing in different holes\r\nin the ice. After some time, it happened to make its appearance on\r\nthe exterior, when a harpoon was struck at the moment it was on the\r\npoint of proceeding again beneath. About a hundred yards from the\r\nedge, it broke the ice where it was a foot in thickness with its\r\ncrown, and respired through the opening. It then determinately\r\npushed forward, breaking the ice as it advanced, in spite of the\r\nlances continually directed against it. It reached at length a kind\r\nof basin in the field, where it floated on the surface of the water\r\nwithout any encumbrance from ice. Its back being fairly exposed, the\r\nharpoon struck from the boat was observed to be so slightly entangled\r\nthat it was ready to drop out. Some of the officers lamented this\r\ncircumstance, and expressed a wish that the harpoon were better fast,\r\nobserving at the same time that if it should slip out, the fish would\r\neither be lost, or they would be under the necessity of flensing it\r\nwhere it lay, and of dragging the pieces of blubber over the ice to\r\nthe ship, a kind and degree of labour every one was anxious to avoid.\r\nNo sooner was the wish expressed, and its importance made known, than\r\none of the sailors, a smart and enterprising fellow, stepped forward\r\nand volunteered his services to strike it better in. Not at all\r\nintimidated by the surprise which was manifested in every countenance\r\nby such a bold proposal, he pulled out his pocket-knife, leapt\r\nupon the back of the living whale, and immediately cut the harpoon\r\nout. Stimulated by this courageous example, two of his companions\r\nproceeded to his assistance. While one of them hauled upon the line,\r\nand held it in his hands, the other set his shoulder against the\r\nextremity of the harpoon, and, though it was without a stock, he\r\ncontrived to strike it again into the fish more effectually than it\r\nwas at first. The fish was in motion before this was finished. After\r\nthey got off its back, it advanced a considerable distance, breaking\r\nthe ice all the way, and survived this uncommon treatment ten or\r\nfifteen minutes. This admirable act was an essential benefit. The\r\nfish sunk spontaneously after being killed, on which it was hauled\r\nout to the edge of the ice by the line, and secured without further\r\ntrouble. It proved a stout whale, and a very acceptable prize.\r\n\r\nWhen a ship approaches a considerable field of ice, and finds\r\nwhales, it is usual to moor to the leeward side of it, from which\r\nthe adjoining ice generally first separates. Boats are then placed\r\non watch on each side of the ship, and stationed at intervals of\r\none hundred or one hundred and fifty yards along the edge of the\r\nice. Hence, if a fish arises anywhere between the extreme boats,\r\nit seldom escapes unhurt. It is not uncommon for a great number of\r\nships to moor to the same sheet of ice. When the whale-fishery of\r\nthe Hollanders was in a flourishing state, above one hundred sail of\r\nships might sometimes be seen moored to the same field of ice, each\r\nhaving two or more boats on watch. The field would in consequence, be\r\nso nearly surrounded with boats, that it was almost impossible for\r\na fish to rise near the verge of the ice without being within the\r\nlimits of a start of some of them.\r\n\r\n3. _Fishing in crowded ice or in open packs._—In navigable open\r\ndrift-ice, or amongst small detached streams and patches, either\r\nof which serve in a degree to break the force of the sea, and to\r\nprevent any considerable swell from arising, we have a situation\r\nwhich is considered as one of the best possible for conducting the\r\nfishery in; consequently, it comes under the same denomination as\r\nthose favourable situations in which I have first attempted to\r\ndescribe the proceedings of the fishers in killing the whale. But\r\nthe situation I now mean to refer to is when the ice is crowded\r\nand nearly close, so close, indeed, that it scarcely affords room\r\nfor boats to pass through it, and by no means sufficient space for\r\na ship to be navigated among it. This kind of situation occurs\r\nin somewhat open packs, or in large patches of crowded ice, and\r\naffords a fair probability of capturing a whale, though it is seldom\r\naccomplished without a considerable deal of trouble. When the ice\r\nis very crowded, and the ship cannot sail into it with propriety,\r\nit is usual, especially with foreigners, to seek out for a mooring\r\nto some mass of ice, if such can be found, extending two or three\r\nfathoms or more under water. A piece of ice of this kind is capable\r\nnot only of holding the ship “head to wind,” but also to windward\r\nof the smaller ice. The boats then set out in chase of any fish\r\nwhich may be seen, and when one happens to be struck, they proceed\r\nin the capture in a similar manner as when under more favourable\r\ncircumstances, excepting so far as the obstruction which the quality\r\nand arrangement of the ice may offer to the regular system of\r\nproceeding. Among crowded ice, for instance, the precise direction\r\npursued by the fish is not easily ascertained, nor can the fish\r\nitself be readily discovered on its first arrival at the surface\r\nafter being struck, on account of the elevation of the intervening\r\nmasses of ice, and the great quantity of line it frequently takes\r\nfrom the fast-boat. Success in such a situation depends on the boats\r\nbeing spread widely abroad, and on a judicious arrangement of each\r\nboat; on a keen look out on the part of the harpooners in the boats,\r\nand on their occasionally taking the benefit of a hummock of ice,\r\nfrom the elevation of which the fish may sometimes be seen blowing\r\nin the interstices of the ice; on pushing or rowing the boats with\r\nthe greatest imaginable celerity towards the place where the fish may\r\nhave been seen; and lastly, on the exercise of the highest degree of\r\nactivity and dispatch in every proceeding.\r\n\r\nIf these be neglected, the fish will generally have taken breath,\r\nrecovered its strength, and removed to some other quarter, before\r\nthe arrival of the boats; and it is often remarked, that if there be\r\none part of the ice more crowded or more difficult of access than\r\nanother, it commonly retreats thither for refuge. In such cases, the\r\nsailors find much difficulty in getting to it with their boats,\r\nhaving to separate many pieces of ice before they can pass through\r\nbetween them. But when it is not practicable to move the pieces, and\r\nwhen they cannot travel over them, they must either drag the boats\r\nacross the intermediate ice, or perform an extensive circuit before\r\nthey can reach the opposite side of the close ice, into which the\r\nwhale has retreated.\r\n\r\nA second harpoon in this case, as indeed in all others, is a material\r\npoint. They proceed to lance whenever the second harpoon is struck,\r\nand strike more harpoons as the auxiliary boats progressively arrive\r\nat the place. When the fish is killed, it is often at a distance from\r\nthe ship, and so circumstanced that the ship cannot get near it.\r\nIn such cases, the fish must be towed by the boats to the ship; an\r\noperation which, among crowded ice, is most troublesome and laborious.\r\n\r\n4. _Bay-ice fishing._—Bay-ice constitutes a situation which, though\r\nnot particularly dangerous, is yet, on the whole, one of the most\r\ntroublesome in which whales are killed. In sheets of bay-ice, the\r\nwhales find a very effectual shelter; for so long as the ice will\r\nnot carry a man, they cannot be approached with a boat without\r\nproducing such a noise as must certainly warn them of the intended\r\nassault; and if a whale, by some favourable accident, were struck,\r\nthe difficulties of completing the capture are always numerous, and\r\nsometimes prove insurmountable. The whale having free locomotion\r\nbeneath the ice, the fishers pursue it under great disadvantage.\r\nThe fishers cannot push their boats toward it but with extreme\r\ndifficulty, while the whale, invariably warned by the noise of their\r\napproach, possesses every facility for avoiding its enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1813, I adopted a new plan of fishing in bay-ice, which\r\nwas attended with the most successful result. The ship under my\r\ncommand, the Esk, of Whitby, was frozen into a sheet of bay-ice,\r\nincluded in a triangular space, formed by several massive fields and\r\nfloes. Here a number of small whales were seen sporting around us in\r\nevery little hole or space in the bay-ice, and occasionally they were\r\nobserved to break through it for the purpose of breathing. In various\r\nlittle openings free of ice near the ship, few of which were twenty\r\nyards in diameter, we placed boats, each equipped with a harpoon and\r\nlines, and directed by two or three men. They had orders to place\r\nthemselves in such a situation that if a fish appeared in the same\r\nopening they could scarcely fail of striking it. Previous to this, I\r\nsupplied myself with a pair of ice-shoes, consisting of two pieces of\r\nthin deal, six feet in length, and seven inches in breadth. They were\r\nmade very thin at both ends, and in the centre of each was a hollow\r\nplace, exactly adapted for the reception of the sole of my boot, with\r\na loop of leather for confining the toes. I was thus enabled to\r\nretain the ice-shoes pretty firmly to my feet when required, or, when\r\nI wished it, to disengage them in a moment. Where the ice was smooth,\r\nit was easy to move in a straight line, but in turning I found a\r\nconsiderable difficulty, and required some practice before I could\r\neffect it without falling. I advanced with tolerable speed, where\r\nthe ice was level on the surface, by sliding the shoes alternately\r\nforward, but when I met with rough hilly places I experienced great\r\ninconvenience. When, however, the rough places happened to consist of\r\nstrong ice, which generally was the case, I stept out of my ice-shoes\r\nuntil I reached a weaker part. Equipped with this apparatus, I\r\ntravelled safely over ice which had not been frozen above twenty-four\r\nhours, and which was incapable of supporting the weight of the\r\nsmallest boy in the ship.\r\n\r\nWhenever a fish was struck, I gave orders to the harpooner, in\r\nrunning the line, to use every means of drowning it; the trouble of\r\nhauling it up, under the circumstances in which the ship was placed,\r\nbeing a matter of no consideration. This was attempted by holding\r\na steady tight strain on the line, without slacking it or jerking\r\nit unnecessarily, and by forbearing to haul the line when the fish\r\nstopped. By this measure, one fish, the stoutest of the three which\r\nwe got, was drowned. When others were struck, and the attempt to\r\ndrown them failed, I provided myself with a harpoon, and observing\r\nthe direction of the line, travelled towards the place where I\r\nexpected the fish to rise. A small boat was launched, more leisurely,\r\nin the same direction for my support; and whenever the ice in my\r\ntrack was capable of supporting a man, assistance was afforded me\r\nin dragging the line. When the wounded fish appeared, I struck my\r\nharpoon through the ice, and then, with some occasional assistance,\r\nproceeded to lance it, until it was killed. At different times, the\r\nfish rose beneath my feet, and broke the ice on which I stood; on\r\none occasion, where the ice was happily more than usually strong,\r\nI was obliged to leave my ice shoes, and skip off. In this way we\r\ncaptured three fish, and took their produce on board, while several\r\nships near us made not the least progress in the fishery. After they\r\nwere killed, we had much trouble in getting them to the ship, but\r\nas we could not employ ourselves to advantage in any other way, we\r\nwere well satisfied with the issue. This part of the business I could\r\nnot effect alone, and all hands, who were occasionally employed in\r\nit, broke through the ice. Some individuals broke in two or three\r\ntimes, but no serious accident ensued. As a precaution, we extended\r\na rope from man to man, which was held in the hands of each in their\r\nprogress across the ice, and which served for drawing those out of\r\nthe water who happened to break through. Sometimes ten or a dozen of\r\nthem would break in at once, but so far was such an occurrence from\r\nexciting distress, that each of their companions indulged a laugh at\r\ntheir expense, notwithstanding they probably shared the same fate a\r\nminute or two afterwards.\r\n\r\n5. _Fishing in storms._—Excepting in situations sheltered from the\r\nice, it would be alike useless and presumptuous to attempt to kill\r\nwhales during a storm. Instances, however, occur, wherein fish that\r\nwere struck during fine weather, or in winds which do not prevent\r\nthe boats from plying about, remain entangled, but unsubdued, after\r\nthe commencement of a storm. Sometimes the capture is completed, at\r\nothers the fishers are under the necessity of cutting the lines, and\r\nallowing the whale to escape. Sometimes, when they have succeeded\r\nin killing it, and in securing it during the gale with a hawser to\r\nthe ship, they are enabled to make a prize of it on the return of\r\nmoderate weather; at others, after having it to appearance secured by\r\nmeans of a sufficient rope, the dangerous proximity of an ice-pack\r\nconstrains them to cut it adrift and abandon it for the preservation\r\nof their vessel. After thus being abandoned, it becomes the prize of\r\nthe first who gets possession of it, though it be in the face of the\r\noriginal capturers. A storm commencing while the boats are engaged\r\nwith an entangled fish, sometimes occasions serious disasters.\r\nGenerally, however, though they suffer the loss of the fish, and\r\nperhaps some of their boats and materials, yet the men escape with\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n6. _Fishing in foggy weather._—The fishery in storms can never be\r\nvoluntary; but in foggy weather, though occasionally attended with\r\nhazard, the fishery is not altogether impracticable. The fogs which\r\noccur in the icy regions in June and July are generally dense and\r\nlasting: they are so thick, that objects cannot be distinguished at\r\nthe distance of 100 or 150 yards, and frequently continue for several\r\ndays without attenuation. To fish with safety and success, during\r\na thick fog, is, therefore, a matter of difficulty, and of still\r\ngreater uncertainty. When it happens that a fish conducts itself\r\nfavourably, that is, descends almost perpendicularly, and, on its\r\nreturn to the surface, remains nearly stationary, or moves round in a\r\nsmall circle, the capture is usually accomplished without hazard or\r\nparticular difficulty; but when, on the contrary, it proceeds with\r\nany considerable velocity in a horizontal direction, or obliquely\r\ndownwards, it soon drags the boats out of sight of the ship, and\r\nshortly so confounds the fishers in the intensity of the mist, that\r\nthey lose all traces of the situation of their vessel. If the fish,\r\nin its flight, draws them beyond the reach of the sound of a bell,\r\nor a horn, their personal safety becomes endangered; and if they are\r\nremoved beyond the sound of cannon, their situation becomes extremely\r\nhazardous, especially if no other ships happen to be in the immediate\r\nvicinity. Meanwhile, whatever may be their imaginary or real danger,\r\nthe mind of their commander must be kept in the most anxious suspense\r\nuntil they are found; and whether they may be in safety or near\r\nperishing with fatigue, hunger, and cold, so long as he is uncertain\r\nof their fate, his anxiety must be the same.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the subsequent operations of the whalers,\r\nconnected with a successful fishery, I shall give a few examples\r\nof remarkable strength, activity, or other peculiarity, in the\r\nbehaviour of whales after they have been struck, being a few of the\r\ncurious circumstances connected with the fishery which I have myself\r\nobserved, or have received from unquestionable authority. On the\r\n25th June, 1812, one of the harpooners belonging to the Resolution,\r\nof Whitby, under my command, struck a whale by the edge of a small\r\nfloe of ice; assistance being promptly afforded, a second boat’s\r\nlines were attached to those of the fast-boat in a few minutes after\r\nthe harpoon was discharged; the remainder of the boats proceeded to\r\nsome distance in the direction which the fish seemed to have taken.\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour, the fast-boat, to my surprise, again\r\nmade a signal for lines. As the ship was then within five minutes’\r\nsail, we instantly steered towards the boat, with the view of\r\naffording assistance by means of a spare boat we still retained on\r\nboard. Before we reached the place, however, we observed four oars\r\ndisplayed in signal order, which, by their number, indicated a most\r\nurgent necessity for assistance. Two or three men were at the same\r\ntime seen seated close by the stern, which was considerably elevated,\r\nfor the purpose of keeping it down, while the bow of the boat, by\r\nthe force of the line, was drawn down to the level of the sea, and\r\nthe harpooner, by the friction of the line round the bollard, was\r\nenveloped in smoky obscurity. At length, when the ship was scarcely\r\none hundred yards distant, we perceived preparations for quitting\r\nthe boat. The sailors’ pea jackets were cast upon the adjoining ice;\r\nthe oars were thrown down; the crew leaped overboard; the bow of\r\nthe boat was buried in the water; the stern rose perpendicularly,\r\nand then majestically disappeared. The harpooner having caused the\r\nend of the line to be fastened to the iron ring at the boat’s stern\r\nwas the means of its loss; and a _tongue_ of the ice, on which was\r\na depth of several feet of water, kept the boat, by the pressure of\r\nthe line against it, at such a considerable distance as prevented\r\nthe crew from leaping upon the floe. Some of them were, therefore,\r\nput to the necessity of swimming for their preservation, but all of\r\nthem succeeded in scrambling upon the ice, and were taken on board\r\nthe ship in a few minutes. It may be here observed, that it is an\r\nuncommon circumstance for a fish to require more than two boats’\r\nlines in such a situation; none of our harpooners, therefore, had\r\nany scruple in leaving the fast-boat, never suspecting, after it had\r\nreceived the assistance of one boat with six lines, or upward, that\r\nit would need any more.\r\n\r\nSeveral ships being about us, there was a possibility that some\r\nperson might attack and make a prize of the whale, when it had so far\r\nescaped us that we no longer retained any hold of it; as such, we set\r\nall sail the ship could safely sustain, and worked through several\r\nnarrow and intricate channels in the ice in the direction I observed\r\nthe fish had retreated. After a little time, it was descried by the\r\npeople in the boats at a considerable distance to the eastward; a\r\ngeneral chase immediately commenced, and within the space of an hour\r\nthree harpoons were struck. We now imagined that the fish was secure,\r\nbut our expectations were premature. The whale resolutely pushed\r\nbeneath a large floe that had been recently broken to pieces by the\r\nswell, and soon drew all the lines out of the second fast-boat, the\r\nofficer of which, not being able to get any assistance, tied the\r\nend of his line to a hummock of ice and broke it. Soon afterwards,\r\nthe other two boats, still _fast_, were dragged against the broken\r\nfloe, when one of the harpoons drew out. The lines of only one\r\nboat, therefore remained fast to the fish, and this, with six or\r\neight lines out, was dragged forward into the shattered floe with\r\nastonishing force; pieces of ice, each of which were sufficiently\r\nlarge to have answered the purpose of a mooring for the ship, were\r\nwheeled about by the strength of the whale; and such was the tension\r\nand elasticity of the line that, whenever it slipped clear of any\r\nmass of ice, after turning it round into the space between any two\r\nadjoining pieces, the boat and its crew flew forward through the\r\ncrack with the velocity of an arrow, and never failed to launch\r\nseveral feet upon the first mass of ice that it encountered.\r\n\r\nWhile we scoured the sea around the broken floe of the ship, and\r\nwhile the ice was attempted in vain by the boats, the whale continued\r\nto press forward in an easterly direction towards the sea. At length,\r\nwhen fourteen lines, about 1,680 fathoms, were drawn from the fourth\r\nfast-boat, a slight entanglement of the line broke it at the stern.\r\nThe fish again made its escape, taking along with it a boat and\r\ntwenty-eight lines. The united length of the lines was 6,720 yards,\r\nor upwards of three English miles and three-quarters; value with\r\nthe boat above £150 sterling. The obstruction of the sunken boat to\r\nthe progress of the fish must have been immense, and that of the\r\nlines likewise considerable, the weight of the lines alone being\r\nthirty-five hundred weight. So long as the fourth fast-boat, through\r\nthe medium of its lines, retained its hold of the fish, we searched\r\nthe adjoining sea with the ship in vain, but in a short time after\r\nthe line was divided we got sight of the object of pursuit at the\r\ndistance of near two miles to the eastward of the ice and boats, in\r\nthe open sea. One boat only with lines, and two empty boats, were\r\nreserved by the ship. Having, however, happily fine weather and a\r\nbreeze of wind, we immediately gave chase under all sails, though it\r\nmust be confessed with the insignificant force by us, the distance\r\nof the fish, and the rapidity of its flight considered, we had but\r\nvery small hopes of success. At length, after pursuing it five or\r\nsix miles, being at least nine miles from the place where it was\r\nstruck, we came up with it, and it seemed inclined to rest after its\r\nextraordinary exertion. The two dismantled or empty boats having\r\nbeen furnished with two lines each, (a very inadequate supply,)\r\nthey, together with the one in good state of equipment, now made an\r\nattack upon the whale. One of the harpooners made a blunder; the\r\nfish saw the boat, took the alarm, and again fled. I now supposed it\r\nwould be seen no more; nevertheless, we chased nearly a mile in the\r\ndirection I imagined it had taken, and placed the boats to the best\r\nof my judgment in the most advantageous situations. In this instance\r\nwe were extremely successful. The fish rose near one of the boats,\r\nand was immediately harpooned. In a few minutes, two more harpoons\r\nentered its back, and lances were plied against it with vigour and\r\nsuccess. Exhausted by its amazing exertions to escape, it yielded\r\nitself at length to its fate, received the piercing wounds of the\r\nlances without resistance, and finally died without a struggle. After\r\nall, it may seem surprising that it was not a particularly large\r\nindividual, the largest lamina of whalebone only measuring nine feet\r\nsix inches, while those affording twelve feet bone are not uncommon.\r\nThe quantity of line withdrawn from the different boats engaged in\r\nthe capture was singularly great. It amounted altogether to 10,440\r\nyards, or nearly six English miles. Of these, thirteen new lines were\r\nlost, together with the sunken boat, the harpoon connecting them\r\nwith the fish having dropped out before the whale was killed. Thus\r\nterminated with success an attack upon a whale, which exhibited the\r\nmost uncommon determination to escape from its pursuers, seconded by\r\nthe most amazing strength, of any individual whose capture I ever\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nWhen engaged in the pursuit of a large whale, it is a necessary\r\nprecaution for two boats at all times to proceed in company, that\r\nthe one may be able to assist the other on any emergency. With\r\nthis principle in view, two boats from the Esk were sent out in\r\nchase of some large whales, on the 13th of June, 1814. No ice was\r\nwithin sight, the boats had proceeded some time together, when they\r\nseparated in pursuit of two whales, not far distant from each other,\r\nwhen, by a singular coincidence, the harpooners each struck his fish\r\nat the same moment. They were a mile from the ship. Urgent signals\r\nfor assistance were immediately displayed by each boat, and, in\r\na few minutes, one of the harpooners was under the necessity of\r\nslipping the end of his line. Happily, the other fish did not descend\r\nso deep, and the lines in the boat proved adequate to the occasion.\r\nOne of the fish being then supposed to be lost, five of the boats,\r\nout of seven, attended on the fish which yet remained entangled, and\r\nspeedily killed it. A short time afterwards, the other fish supposed\r\nto be irrecoverably lost, was descried at a little distance from the\r\nplace where it was struck; three boats proceeded against it; it was\r\nimmediately struck, and in twenty minutes also killed. Thus were\r\nsuccessfully captured two whales, both of which had been despaired\r\nof. They produced us near forty tuns of oil, value at that time\r\n£1,400. The lines attached to the fish last killed were recovered in\r\na remarkable manner. The harpooners were busily engaged in attempting\r\nto secure them, when the harpoon, by which alone they were prevented\r\nfrom sinking, slipped out; but as it descended in the water, it\r\nluckily hooked the line belonging to another boat, by which both\r\nharpoon and lines were preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is very generally believed by the whalers, that fish have\r\noccasionally been struck, which, by sudden extension or heave of the\r\nbody, have instantly disengaged themselves from the harpoon. This\r\nusually happens when the whale is struck “with a slack back,” as\r\nthat position of the fish is denominated, in which the back being\r\ndepressed the flesh is relaxed. A harpoon then struck occasions\r\nan uncommon wound. Hence, if the fish suddenly extends itself and\r\nelevates its back, the wound appears of twice the size of the\r\nharpoon, and consequently the weapon is capable of being thrown\r\nout by the jerk of the body. Under such circumstances as these, a\r\nlarge whale was struck by a harpooner belonging to the ship Howe,\r\nof Shields. The fish extending and lifting its back with uncommon\r\nviolence, the harpoon was disengaged and projected high into the air,\r\nwhen, at the same moment, the fish rolled over upon its back, and\r\nreceived the point of the falling weapon in its belly, whereby it was\r\ncaptured and caught. This circumstance, romantic as it may appear,\r\nis so well authenticated by the person who struck the fish, together\r\nwith others who were in the boat at the same time, and were witnesses\r\nof the fact, that I have no scruple in introducing it here.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May, 1817, the Royal Bounty, of Leith, captain\r\nDrysdale, fell in with a great number of whales, in the lat. 77° 25′\r\nnorth, and long. 5° or 6° east. Neither ice nor land was in sight,\r\nnor was there supposed to be either the one or the other within fifty\r\nor sixty miles. A brisk breeze of wind prevailed, and the weather\r\nwas clear. The boats were, therefore, manned and sent in pursuit.\r\nAfter a chase of about five hours, the harpooner, commanding a boat,\r\nwho, with another in company, had rowed out of sight of the ship,\r\nstruck one of the whales. This was about four A.M., of the 29th. The\r\ncaptain, supposing from the long absence of the two most distant\r\nboats that a fish had been struck, directed the course of the ship\r\ntowards the place where he had last seen them, and about eight A.M.\r\nhe got sight of a boat which displayed the signal for being _fast_.\r\nSome time afterwards, he observed the other boat approach the fish, a\r\nsecond harpoon struck, and the usual signal displayed. As, however,\r\nthe fish dragged the two boats away with considerable speed, it was\r\nmidday before any assistance could reach them. Two more harpoons were\r\nthen struck, but such was the vigour of the whale that, although it\r\nconstantly dragged through the water four to six boats, together\r\nwith a length of 1,600 fathoms of line which it had drawn out of the\r\ndifferent boats, yet it pursued its flight nearly as fast as a boat\r\ncould row and such was the terror that it manifested on the approach\r\nof its enemies, that, whenever a boat passed beyond its tail, it\r\ninvariably dived. All their endeavours to lance it were, therefore,\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nThe crews of the loose boats being unable to keep pace with the\r\nfish, caught hold of and moored themselves to the fast-boats; and\r\nfor some hours afterwards, all hands were constrained to sit in\r\nidle impatience, waiting for some relaxation in the speed of the\r\nwhale. Its most general course had hitherto been to windward,\r\nbut a favourable change taking place, enabled the ship, which had\r\npreviously been at a great distance, to join the boats at eight P.M.\r\nThey succeeded in tacking one of the lines to the ship which was\r\nfast to the fish, with a view of retarding its flight. They then\r\nfurled the top-gallant sails, and lowered the top sails; but after\r\nsupporting the ship a few minutes head to wind, the wither of the\r\nharpoon upset or twisted aside, and the instrument was disengaged\r\nfrom its grasp. The whale immediately set off to windward with\r\nincreased speed, and it required an interval of three hours before\r\nthe ship could again approach it. Another line was then taken on\r\nboard, which immediately broke. A fifth harpoon had previously been\r\nstruck, to replace the one which had been pulled out, but the line\r\nattached to it was soon afterwards cut. They then instituted various\r\nschemes for arresting the speed of the fish, which occupied their\r\nclose attention nearly two hours. But its velocity was yet such that\r\nthe master, who had himself proceeded to the attack, was unable to\r\napproach sufficiently near to strike a harpoon. After a long chase,\r\nhowever, he succeeded in getting hold of one of the lines which the\r\nfish dragged after it, and in fastening another line to it. The\r\nfish then happily turned towards the ship, which was a considerable\r\ndistance to leeward.\r\n\r\nAt four P.M. of the 30th, thirty-six hours after the fish had been\r\nstruck, the ship again joined the boats, when, by a successful\r\nmanœuvre, they secured two of the fast lines on board. The wind\r\nblowing a moderately brisk breeze, the top-gallant sails were taken\r\nin, the courses hauled up, and the top sails clewed down, but,\r\nnotwithstanding the resistance a ship thus situated must necessarily\r\noffer, she was towed by the fish directly to windward with the\r\nvelocity of at least one-half to two knots during an hour and a half;\r\nand then, though the whale must have been greatly exhausted, it beat\r\nthe water with its fins and tail in so tremendous a way, that the sea\r\naround was in a continual foam, and the most hardy of the sailors\r\nscarcely dared to approach it. At length, about eight P.M., after\r\nforty hours of almost incessant, and for the most part fruitless\r\nexertion, this formidable and astonishing animal was killed. The\r\ncapture and the flensing occupied forty-eight hours. The fish was\r\neleven feet four inches in bone, (the length of the longest lamina of\r\nwhalebone,) and its produce filled forty-seven butts, or twenty-three\r\nand a half tun casks, with blubber.\r\n\r\nI proceed now to enumerate the proceedings of the fishers after a\r\nwhale is killed. Some preliminary measures are requisite before a\r\nwhale can be flensed. The first operation performed on a dead whale\r\nis to lash it with a rope, passed several times through two holes\r\npierced through the tail to the bow of the boat. The more difficult\r\noperation of freeing the whale from the entanglement of the line is\r\nthen attempted. As the whale, when dead, always lies on its back or\r\non its side, the lines and harpoons are generally far under water.\r\nWhen they are seen passing obliquely downwards, they are hooked\r\nwith a grapnel, pulled to the surface, and cut. But, when they hang\r\nperpendicular, or when they cannot be seen, they are discovered by\r\na process called “sweeping a fish.” This is performed by taking\r\na part of a whale-line in two different boats, ten or fifteen\r\nfathoms asunder, and while one boat lies at rest, supporting the\r\nend of a line, the other is rowed round the fish, and the bight or\r\nintermediate part of the line allowed to sink below the fish as it\r\nproceeds, until each of the parts held in the two boats are again\r\nbrought together. Hence, when one part of the line has made a circuit\r\nof the fish, it must evidently inclose every other line or appendage\r\naffixed to it. Thus inclosed, they are pulled up to the surface of\r\nthe water, and each of them cut at the splice of the fore-ganger,\r\nleaving the harpoon sticking in the fish, with its fore-ganger\r\nattached, and allowing the end of the line to sink, and be hauled on\r\nboard of the boat from whence it was withdrawn at the convenience of\r\nthe crew. While this is in progress, the men of other boats, having\r\nfirst lashed the tail to a boat, are employed in lashing the fins\r\ntogether across the belly of the whale.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I was myself engaged in the capture of a fish, upon\r\nwhich, when to appearance dead, I leaped, cut holes in the fins,\r\nand was in the act of “reeving” a rope through them to lash them\r\ntogether, when the fish sank beneath my feet. As soon as I observed\r\nthat the water had risen above my knees, I made a spring towards a\r\nboat, at the distance of three or four yards from me, and caught\r\nhold of the gunwale. Scarcely was I helped on board, before the fish\r\nbegan to move forward, turn from its back upon its belly, reared its\r\ntail aloft, and began to shake it with such prodigious violence, as\r\nto resound through the air to the distance of two or three miles. In\r\nthe meanwhile all the sailors very properly kept aloof, and beheld\r\nits extraordinary power with the greatest astonishment. After two or\r\nthree minutes of this violent exercise, it ceased, rolled upon its\r\nside, and died.\r\n\r\nA fish being properly secured, is then “taken in tow;” that is, all\r\nthe boats form themselves in a line, by ropes always carried for the\r\npurpose, and unite their efforts in rowing towards the ship. Towing\r\na fish is usually considered a cheerful though laborious operation,\r\nand is generally performed with great expressions of joy. A large\r\nwhale, by means of six boats, can be towed at a rate of nearly a\r\nmile per hour. The fish having reached the ship, is taken to the\r\nlarboard side, arranged and secured for flensing. For the performance\r\nof this operation, a variety of knives and other instruments are\r\nrequisite. Towards the stern of the ship the head of the fish is\r\ndirected, and the tail, which is first cut off, rests abreast of the\r\nfore-chains; the smallest or posterior part of the whale’s body,\r\nwhere the tail is united, is called the rump, and the extremity or\r\nanterior part of the head, the nose or nose-end. The rump, then,\r\nsupported by a tackle, is drawn forward by means of a stout rope,\r\ncalled the rump-rope; and the head is drawn in an opposite direction,\r\nby means of the “nose-tackle.” Hence the body of the fish is forcibly\r\nextended. The right-side fin, being next the ship, is lashed upwards\r\ntowards the gunwale. A band of blubber, two or three feet in width,\r\nencircling the fish’s body, and lying between the fins and the head,\r\nbeing the fat of the neck, or what corresponds in other animals with\r\nthe neck, is called the kent, because by means of it the fish is\r\nturned over, or kented. Now, to the commencement of this imaginary\r\nband of fat, or kent, is fixed the lower extremity of a combination\r\nof powerful blocks, called the kent-purchase. Its upper extremity\r\nis fixed round the head of the main-mast, and its fall or rope is\r\napplied to the windlass, drawn tight, and the upper surface of the\r\nfish raised several inches above the water. The enormous weight of\r\na whale prevents the possibility of raising it more than one-fourth\r\nor one-fifth part out of the water, except indeed when it has been\r\nsome days dead, in which case it swells, in consequence of air\r\ngenerated by putrefaction, until one-third of its bulk appears above\r\nthe surface. The fish then lying belly upward, extended, and well\r\nsecured, is ready for commencing the operation of flensing. In this\r\nstate a suspension of labour is generally allowed, in which the crew\r\nrefresh themselves and prepare for the ensuing duties.\r\n\r\nAn unhappy circumstance once occurred in an interval of this kind.\r\nAt that period of the fishery, (forty or fifty years ago,) when a\r\nsingle stout whale was sufficient to remunerate the owners of a\r\nship for the expenses of the voyage, great joy was exhibited on\r\nthe capture of a whale by the fishers. They not only had a dram of\r\nspirits, but were sometimes provided with some favourite “mess,”\r\non which to regale themselves before they commenced the arduous\r\ntask of flensing. At such a period, the crew of an English vessel\r\nhad captured their first whale. It was taken to the ship, placed\r\non the lee-side, and though the wind blew a strong breeze, it was\r\nfastened only by a small rope attached to the fin. In this state\r\nof supposed security, all hands retired to regale themselves, the\r\ncaptain himself not excepted. The ship being at a distance from any\r\nice, and the fish believed to be secure, they made no great haste in\r\ntheir enjoyment. At length, the specksioneer, having spent sufficient\r\ntime in indulgence and equipment, with an air of importance and\r\nself-confidence, proceeded on deck, and naturally turned to look on\r\nthe whale. To his astonishment it was not there. In some alarm, he\r\nlooked astern, ahead, on the other side, but his search was useless;\r\nthe ship drifting fast had pressed forcibly upon the whale, the rope\r\nbroke, the fish sank, and was lost. The mortification of this event\r\nmay be conceived, but the termination of their vexation will not\r\neasily be imagined, when it is known that no other opportunity of\r\nprocuring a whale occurred during the voyage. The ship returned home\r\nclean. The blessings of Divine Providence, of a temporal and also\r\nof a spiritual kind, are bestowed and continued in union with the\r\nactivity and watchfulness of those who receive them, and it is a law\r\nof the earthly, and also of the heavenly treasure, that “whosoever\r\nhath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall\r\nbe taken even that which he seemeth to have.”\r\n\r\nAfter the whale is properly secured, and the men are sufficiently\r\nrefreshed, the harpooners, having their feet armed with “spurs,”\r\nto prevent them from slipping, descend upon the fish. Two boats,\r\neach of which is under the guidance of one or two boys, attend upon\r\nthem, and serve to hold all their knives and other apparatus. Thus\r\nprovided, the harpooners, directed by the specksioneer, divide the\r\nfat into oblong pieces, or “slips,” by means of “blubber-spades”\r\nand “blubber-knives;” then affixing a “speck-tackle” to each slip,\r\nprogressively flay it off as it is drawn upward. The speck-tackles,\r\nwhich are two or three in number, are rendered effective by\r\ncapsterns, winches, or other mechanical powers. Each of them consists\r\nof a simple combination of two single blocks, one of which is\r\nsecurely fixed in a strong rope, extended between the main-top and\r\nthe fore-top, called a guy, and the other is attached by a strap\r\nto the blubber of the whale. The flensers commence with the belly\r\nand under-jaw, being the only part then above water. The blubber,\r\nin pieces of half a ton to a ton each, is received upon deck by the\r\nboat-steerers and line-managers, the former with “strand-knives”\r\ndivide it into portable, cubical, or oblong pieces, containing near\r\na solid foot of fat, while the latter, furnished with “pick-haaks,”\r\npass it between decks, down a hole in the main-hatches. It is then\r\nreceived by two men styled kings, who pack it in a receptacle\r\nprovided for it in the hold, or other suitable place, called the\r\nflense-gut, where it remains until further convenience.\r\n\r\nAll the fat being taken away from the belly, and the right fin\r\nremoved, the fish is then turned on its side, by means of the kent,\r\nwhich, by the power of the windlass, readily performs this office.\r\nThe upper surface of fat is again removed, together with the left\r\nfin, and after a second kenting one of the “lips” is taken away,\r\nby which the whale-bone of one side of the head, now lying nearly\r\nhorizontal, is exposed. The fish being a little further turned,\r\nthe whalebone of the left side is dislodged by the use of the “bone\r\nhand-spikes,” “bone-knives,” and “bone-spades.” Four instruments,\r\nwhich, when combined, constitute what is called the bone-geer, are\r\nused, with the assistance of two speck-tackles, for taking up the\r\nwhalebone in one mass. On its arrival on deck, it is split with\r\n“bone-wedges” and “junks,” containing from five to ten blades each,\r\nand stowed away. A further kenting brings the fish’s back upward,\r\nand the next exposes the second side of bone. As the fish is turned\r\nor kented round, every part of the blubber becomes progressively\r\nuppermost and is removed. At length, when the whole of the blubber,\r\nwhalebone, and jawbones have been taken on board, the kent, which now\r\nappears a slip of perhaps thirty feet in length, is also separated,\r\ntogether with the rump-rope and nose-tackle, on which the carcase\r\nbeing at liberty, generally sinks in the water and disappears. When\r\nit floats, however, it becomes food for bears, sharks, and various\r\nkinds of birds, all of which attack it with the most voracious\r\nearnestness. It is known by the name of the kreng.\r\n\r\nWhen sharks are present, they generally take the liberty of helping\r\nthemselves very bountifully during the progress of the flensing, but\r\nthey often pay for their temerity with their lives. Fulmars pay close\r\nattendance in immense numbers. They seize the fragments occasionally\r\ndisengaged by the knife while they are swimming in the water, but\r\nmost of the other gulls who attend on the occasion take their share\r\non the wing. The burgomaster is decidedly the master of the feast.\r\nHence, every other bird is obliged to relinquish the most delicious\r\nmorsel when the burgomaster descends to claim it. Bears seldom\r\napproach so near the ship as to become partakers of the banquet.\r\nWhen dispatch is seconded by ability, the operation of flensing\r\ncan be accomplished on a fish affording from twenty to thirty tons\r\nof blubber in the space of three or four hours, and, probably, the\r\naverage time with British fishers but little exceeds four hours.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, I was witness of a circumstance in which a harpooner\r\nwas exposed to the most imminent risk of his life, at the conclusion\r\nof a flensing process, by a very curious accident. This harpooner\r\nstood on one of the jaw-bones of a fish with a boat by his side. In\r\nthis situation, while he was in the act of cutting the kreng adrift,\r\na boy inadvertently struck the point of the boat-hook, with which\r\nhe usually held the boat, through the ring of the harpooner’s spur,\r\nand in the same act seized the jawbone of the fish with the hook of\r\nthe same instrument. Before this was discovered, the kreng was set\r\nat liberty, and began instantly to sink. The harpooner then threw\r\nhimself towards the boat, but being firmly entangled by the foot,\r\nhe fell into the water. Providentially he caught the gunwale of the\r\nboat with his hands, but, overpowered by the force of the sinking\r\nkreng, he was on the point of relinquishing his grasp when some of\r\nhis companions got hold of his hands, while others threw a rope round\r\nhis body. The carcase of the fish was suspended entirely by the\r\npoor fellow’s body, which was, consequently, so dreadfully extended\r\nthat there was some danger of his being drawn asunder. But such was\r\nhis terror of being taken under water, and not, indeed, without\r\ncause, for he could never have risen again, that, notwithstanding\r\nthe excruciating pain he suffered, he constantly cried out to his\r\ncompanions to “haul away the rope.” He remained in that dreadful\r\nstate until means were adopted for hooking the kreng with the\r\ngrapnel, and bringing it back to the surface of the water. Had he not\r\ncaught hold of the boat as he was sinking and met with such prompt\r\nassistance, he must infallibly have perished.\r\n\r\nNext to the process of flensing is that of making-off. When the\r\nflens-gut is filled with blubber, or when, no fish being seen, a\r\nfavourable opportunity of leisure is presented, the operation of\r\nmaking-off is generally commenced. This consists of freeing the fat\r\nfrom all extraneous substances, especially the muscular parts and\r\nthe skin, then cutting it into small pieces, and putting it into\r\ncask through the bung-holes. In the first instance, the ship must be\r\nmoored to a convenient piece of ice, or placed in an open situation,\r\nand the sails so reduced as to require no further attention in the\r\nevent of bad weather occurring. The hold of the ship must be cleared\r\nof its superstructure of casks, until the “ground tier,” or lowest\r\nstratum of casks is exposed, and the ballast-water must be “started,”\r\nor pumped out of all the casks that are removed upon deck, as well\r\nas out of those on the ground tier, which are first prepared for\r\nthe reception of the blubber. In “breaking out the hold,” it is not\r\nnecessary to lay open more of the ground tier at a time than three or\r\nfour casks extend in length.\r\n\r\nWhile the line-managers, together with the “skee-man,” (the officer\r\nwho has the direction of operations in the hold,) the cooper, and\r\nperhaps a few others, are employed in breaking out the hold, the rest\r\nof the crew on the deck arrange all the variety of apparatus used\r\nfor the preparation of the blubber before it is put into the casks.\r\nOf this apparatus, the most considerable part is the “speck-trough,”\r\nwith its appendages. It consists of a kind of oblong box or chest,\r\nabout twelve feet in length, one and three quarters feet in breadth,\r\nand one and a half feet in depth. The speck-trough is fixed upon the\r\ndeck, as nearly as possible over the place where the casks are to\r\nbe filled in the hold. A square hole made in its bottom is placed\r\neither over the nearest hatchway to the scene of operations, or\r\nupon a corresponding hole cut in the deck. The speck-trough is then\r\nsecured, and its lid turned backwards into an horizontal position.\r\nThe surface of the lid, forming a level table, is then covered with\r\nblocks of whale’s-tail from end to end. This substance makes an\r\nexcellent chopping-block, and preserves the chopping-knives from\r\ninjury when used for dividing the blubber upon it. Into the square\r\nhole in the bottom of the speck-trough is fitted an iron frame, to\r\nwhich is suspended a canvas tube, or “hose,” denominated a “lull.”\r\nThe lull is open at both ends. Its diameter is about a foot, and its\r\nlength sufficient to reach from the deck to the bottom of the hold.\r\nTo the middle, or towards the upper part of the lull, is attached\r\na “pair of nippers,” consisting of two sticks fastened together by\r\na kind of hinge at one end, and capable of being pressed together\r\nat the other. The nippers being passed across the body of the lull,\r\nand their detached extremities brought together, they embrace it so\r\nclosely that nothing can pass downward while they remain in this\r\nposition; but when, on the other hand, the nippers are extended, the\r\nlull forms a free channel of communication between the speck-trough\r\nand the hold.\r\n\r\nEverything being in readiness, the blubber, as it is now thrown\r\nout of the flens-gut by the kings, undergoes the following several\r\noperations. It is received upon deck by the “krengers,” whose office\r\nis to remove all the muscular parts, together with such spongy or\r\nfibrous fat as is known by experience to produce very little oil.\r\nWhen these substances, which go under the general denomination\r\nof kreng, are included among the blubber in the casks, they pass\r\nthrough a kind of fermentation, and generate such a quantity of\r\ngas as sometimes to burst the containing vessels, and occasion the\r\nloss of their contents. From the krengers the blubber passes to the\r\nharpooners. Each of these officers, provided with a blubber-knife,\r\nor a strand-knife, places himself by the side of the “closh,” fixed\r\nin the deck. An attendant, by means of a pair of “hand-hooks,” or a\r\n“pick-haak,” then mounts a piece of blubber upon the spikes of the\r\nclosh, and the harpooner slices off the skin. From the skinners,\r\nthe blubber passes into an open space, called the bank, prepared\r\nas a depository in front of the speck-trough, and it is then laid\r\nupon the chopping-blocks as wanted. It now falls under the hands of\r\nthe boat-steerers, who, armed with chopping-knives, are arranged\r\nin a line by the side of the chopping-blocks with the speck-trough\r\nbefore them. Thus prepared, they divide the blubber, as it is\r\nplaced on their blocks, into oblong pieces, not exceeding four\r\ninches in diameter, and push it into the speck-trough intended for\r\nits reception. And finally, the blubber falls under the direction\r\nof the line-managers, stationed in the hold, who receive it into\r\ntubs through the lull, and pass it with their hands into the casks,\r\nthrough their bung-holes. When a cask is nearly filled, the packing\r\nis completed by the use of a “pricker,” one piece after another being\r\nthrust in by this instrument until it can contain no more. It is then\r\nsecurely bunged up.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground-tier casks, as far as they have been exposed are\r\nfilled, the second-tier of casks is stowed upon it, and likewise\r\nfilled with blubber, together with the third-tier casks when\r\nnecessary. When fish can be had in sufficiency, the hold is filled\r\nand likewise the space between decks. When a ship is deficient in\r\ncasks, vacancies adapted for the reception of the cargo are filled\r\nwith blubber in bulk. The operation of making off was in the early\r\nages of the fishery performed on shore, and even so late as the\r\nmiddle of the last century, it was customary for ships to proceed\r\ninto a harbour, and remain while this process was going on.\r\n\r\nIn the Greenland whale-fishery, the importance of a code of laws\r\nwas at a very early period apparent. A fish struck by the people\r\nof two different ships became an object of dispute, the first\r\nstriker claiming the whole, and the second demanding a share for his\r\nassistance. Stores saved from wrecked vessels, and especially the\r\ncargoes of wrecks, being objects of much moment, were also liable to\r\noccasion disputes in a still higher degree. Hence, about the year\r\n1677, the Dutch issued a code of regulations, founded on equitable\r\nprinciples, for the prevention of quarrels and litigation among the\r\nfishers. As these were found to be insufficient, the States-General\r\nof Holland and West Friesland, in the year 1696, approved and\r\nconfirmed the general regulations with respect to the saving of the\r\ncrews and stores of vessels wrecked in the ice, the right to whales\r\nunder peculiar circumstances, and other matters connected with the\r\nfishery. They consisted of twelve articles, and every captain,\r\nspecksioneer, and officer concerned in the fishery, was obliged to\r\nsubscribe them. After being duly announced, these articles were\r\nenforced by commissioners, chosen from among the principal Greenland\r\nowners of Holland, for conducting and carrying into effect this and\r\nother matters connected with the prosperity and regulation of the\r\nfishery.\r\n\r\nAmong the British whale-fishers, it does not appear that any\r\nparticular laws were ever expressly laid down for the adjusting\r\nof differences; yet custom has established certain principles as\r\nconstituting the rule of right, the legality of which is sufficiently\r\nacknowledged by their being universally respected. The fundamental\r\narticles are two. First, that a fast fish, or a fish in any way in\r\npossession, whether alive or dead, is the sole and unquestionable\r\nproperty of the persons so maintaining the connection or possession;\r\nand secondly, that a loose fish, alive or dead, is fair game. The\r\nfirst of these regulations can need no modification, but the second\r\ncan only be recommended for its simplicity and tendency to prevent\r\nlitigation, since circumstances may, and do, sometimes occur, in\r\nwhich its application is liable to some objection. In this, as in\r\nother departments of human conduct, it is impossible by any strict\r\nregulations to prevent all kinds of injustice. The highest code of\r\nhuman morals enjoins on men what they shall be, as well as what they\r\nshall do, and provides for them the one golden precept, “Whatsoever\r\nye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” Conduct,\r\nwhich it is impossible to punish by appeal to any human tribunal, is\r\noften most fearfully in violation of this law, and must await the\r\ndecisions of that day, when God shall try every man’s work of what\r\nsort it is.\r\n\r\nThe following circumstance, which occurred a good many years ago,\r\nhas a tendency to illustrate the existing Greenland laws, and to\r\nset them in a prominent light. During a storm of wind and snow,\r\nseveral ships were beating to windward, under easy sail, along the\r\nedge of a pack. When the storm abated and the weather cleared, the\r\nships steered towards the ice. Two of the fleet approached it about\r\na mile asunder, abreast of each other, when the crews of each ship\r\naccidentally got sight of a dead fish at a little distance, within\r\nsome loose ice. Each ship now made sail to endeavour to reach the\r\nfish before the other, which fish, being loose, would be the prize\r\nof the first that should get possession of it. Neither ship could\r\noutsail the other, but each continued to press forward toward the\r\nprize. The little advantage one of them had in distance, the other\r\ncompensated with velocity. On each bow of the two ships was stationed\r\na principal officer, armed with a harpoon, in readiness to discharge.\r\nBut it so happened that the ships came in contact with each other,\r\nwhen within a few yards of the fish, and in consequence of the shock\r\nwith which their bows met, they rebounded to a considerable distance.\r\nThe officers at the same moment discharged their harpoons, but all\r\nof them fell short of the fish. A hardy fellow, who was second-mate\r\nof the leeward ship, immediately leaped overboard, and with great\r\ndexterity swam to the whale, seized it by the fin, and proclaimed it\r\nhis prize. It was, however, so swollen, that he was unable to climb\r\nupon it, but was obliged to remain shivering in the water until\r\nassistance should be sent. His captain, elated with his good luck,\r\nforgot, or at least neglected, his brave second-mate, and before\r\nhe thought of sending a boat to release him from his disagreeable\r\nsituation, prepared to moor his ship to an adjoining piece of ice.\r\nMeanwhile, the other ship tacked, and the master himself stepped\r\ninto a boat, pushed off, and rowed deliberately towards the dead\r\nfish. Observing the trembling seaman still in the water, holding by\r\nthe fin, he addressed him with, “Well, my lad, you’ve got a fine\r\nfish here,” to which, after a natural reply in the affirmative,\r\nhe added, “But don’t you find it very cold?” “Yes,” replied the\r\nshivering sailor, “I’m almost starved; I wish you would allow me to\r\ncome into your boat until ours arrive.” This favour needed no second\r\nsolicitation; the boat approached the man, and he was assisted into\r\nit. The fish being again loose and out of possession, the captain\r\ninstantly struck his harpoon into it, hoisted his flag, and claimed\r\nhis prize. Mortified and displeased as the other master felt at this\r\ntrick, for so it certainly was, he had nevertheless no redress,\r\nbut was obliged to permit the fish to be taken on board of his\r\ncompetitor’s ship, and to content himself with abusing the mate for\r\nhis want of discretion, and with condemning himself for not having\r\nmore compassion on the poor fellow’s feelings, which would have\r\nprevented the disagreeable misadventure.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the whale-fishery has been very generally supposed to\r\ndepend, not upon the exercise of talent and industry on the part\r\nof the masters and crews of the fishing-ships, but solely upon\r\nthe freaks of fortune. That the fishery, however, is altogether a\r\nchain of casualties, is as false as it is derogatory to the credit\r\nof the persons employed in the enterprise. The most skilful, from\r\nadventitious and unavoidable circumstances, may occasionally fail,\r\nand the unskilful may be successful; but if we mark the average of\r\na number of years, that is, where the means are equal, a tolerable\r\nestimate may be formed of the adventurer’s ability, and his fitness\r\nfor the undertaking in which he is engaged.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of success, which is observed to result from the\r\nexertions of the different Greenland commanders, when the average\r\nof several voyages is taken, confirmed the above position, and the\r\ncircumstance of some masters, in whatever ship they may sail, almost\r\nalways succeeding, whilst others, however favourably circumstanced,\r\nseldom or ever procure a whole cargo, warrants this conclusion,\r\nthat, most generally, successful fishery depends on the experience,\r\ndetermined perseverance, and personal talent of the master of the\r\nvessel, supported by a necessary degree of skill among the people\r\ncomposing his crew. There are occasions, however, especially in those\r\nseasons when the Greenland Seas are open, or in some measure free\r\nfrom ice, in which personal talent becomes of comparative little\r\navail. This was strikingly the case in the year 1817, and in some\r\ndegree in 1818. In the former season, the ice lay at a distance so\r\nremote from Spitzbergen, that a space of about two thousand square\r\nmiles of the surface of the sea, which is usually covered with ice,\r\nwas wholly void of it. Whatever decisions the judicious fisher was\r\nled by experience to form and act upon proved fallacious, and tended\r\nonly to embarrass him in all his proceedings. The only indication\r\nwhich could be of the least service to the fisher to assist him in\r\nthe choice of a situation, was the colour of the sea. In places where\r\nthe water was transparent, and blue, or greenish blue, it was in\r\nvain to look for whales, but in a certain stream of cloudy water, of\r\na deep olive-green colour, all the whales which were seen throughout\r\nthe season, or at least nine-tenths of them, occurred, and the chief\r\npart of those which were caught were found in the same stream of\r\nwater. This kind of sea-water is the favourite resort of whales\r\nduring the fishing season, evidently because it abounds with various\r\ndescriptions of _actiniæ_, _sepiæ_, _medusæ_, and _cancri_, which\r\nconstitute the chief, if not the sole nourishment of the whale.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the fishery is more certain in close than in open\r\nseasons, and has some dependence on the suitable equipment of\r\nthe ships employed in the trade, on a sufficient apparatus, and\r\nfrequently in no inconsiderable degree on that valuable property\r\nof the ship called fast-sailing. When any opening occurs in the\r\nice of a tempting appearance, it frequently happens that a number\r\nof ships enter it together. The fastest sailers lead the way, and\r\noften procure a whale or two or more before the heavy sailing ships\r\ncan perform a navigation, and by the time the latter accomplish it,\r\nthe run of fish is frequently over. Not a little depends in the\r\nfishery on the confidence the sailors have in the skill of their\r\ncaptain, and the efficiency of the personal talents and exertions\r\nof their officers. If the officers are generally unsuccessful, they\r\nare apt to lose confidence in them, and proceed, even when good\r\nopportunities occur, without spirit to the attack. The greater\r\ntheir spirits and confidence are, the greater is the probability of\r\ntheir success. Hence, the crew of a ship which has met with success\r\ncan generally fish better, and more advantageously under the same\r\ncircumstances, than the people of a clean ship. For the regulation of\r\nthe ship’s movements, for the choice of a situation, for direction in\r\ndifficulties, for a stimulus when discouraged, for encouragement when\r\nweary, and for a variety of other important matters, the master alone\r\nmust be looked to, on whom, indeed, almost every considerable effort\r\nof judgment or forethought devolves.\r\n\r\nI now subjoin a few instances of the dangers which accompany the\r\nwhale-fishery, most of which presented themselves within the sphere\r\nof my own observation. Those employed in the occupation of killing\r\nwhales are, when actually engaged, exposed to danger from three\r\nsources, namely, from the ice, from the climate, and from the\r\nwhales themselves. Of these, the casualties on the ice are the most\r\nuncommon, and the least fatal; those from the climate the most fatal,\r\nbut not the most frequent; and the whale itself is the source of a\r\ngreat proportion of the accidents which occur.\r\n\r\nThe following instance illustrates the danger from overhanging masses\r\nof ice falling on the boats. The crew of one of the Hull whalers,\r\nhaving killed a fish by the side of an iceberg in Davis’s Strait,\r\nthe fins were lashed together, and the tail secured to a boat in the\r\nusual way, but by the efforts only of one boat’s crew, all the other\r\nboats belonging to the same ship being engaged in the capture of two\r\nmore whales, neither of which were yet subdued. This circumstance\r\noccasioned some altercation among the crew of the boat, as to the\r\npropriety of their remaining by the dead whale, or of quitting it,\r\nand proceeding in an empty boat which was at hand to the assistance\r\nof their companions. The latter measure was carried, but as it was\r\ndeemed expedient that one man should remain in the boat, to which\r\nnone of them would consent, they were under the necessity of either\r\nremaining in idleness by the fish, or leaving the fish and the boat\r\nby themselves. But every one being anxious to participate in the more\r\nactive exercises of the fishery, they at length agreed unanimously\r\nto quit the boat connected with the dead fish, and to proceed to the\r\naid of their comrades. The arrangements were just accomplished in\r\ntime, for they had not rowed many fathoms from the place before a\r\ntremendous crash of the berg ensued, an immense mass of ice fell upon\r\nthe boat they had just quitted, and neither it nor the fish was ever\r\nseen afterwards.\r\n\r\nAnother danger arises from ice when boats are inclosed and beset,\r\nand their crews prevented from joining their ships. On June 17th,\r\n1813, several Greenland fishing-ships penetrated the ice into an\r\nenticing opening, in which a number of whales were sporting in\r\nfancied security. The John, of Greenock, Neptune, of Aberdeen, Earl\r\nPercy, of Kirkcaldy, were immediately, to appearance, successful.\r\nThe crew of the John in a short time killed several fish; the people\r\nof the Neptune killed one, and struck a second; and the crew of the\r\nEarl Percy struck one also. Things were in this state when I arrived\r\nin the same situation with the Esk. My harpooners, happily as it\r\nproved, did not succeed in any measure. The sea was as smooth as the\r\nsurface of a pond, but the ice I observed was in a strange state of\r\ndisturbance. Some floes, and some large pieces, moved with a velocity\r\nof three to four miles per hour, while other similar masses were\r\nat rest. The John, which, on her first arrival in this situation,\r\nhad navigated an open lake some leagues in circumference, was in\r\nthe space of a few hours closely beset. The captain of the Neptune,\r\nalarmed by the danger to which his men and boats were exposed, left\r\nhis ship to the care of his second-mate, with eleven or twelve\r\nmen, and proceeded himself in a boat, making the fifth, to their\r\nassistance. In a few minutes, these five boats, together with two\r\nbelonging to the Earl Percy, were closely fixed in the ice. The ships\r\nwere forced to a distance; the ice in the course of the following\r\nmorning spread to the width of seven or eight miles, and shortly\r\nafterwards the people in the boats and those in the corresponding\r\nships lost sight of each other.\r\n\r\nMy father, who at this time commanded the John, had anticipated\r\nthe consequences of the ice closing, and found refuge in a cove in\r\nan adjoining field filled with bay-ice, into which he thrust his\r\nship, and obtained shelter for himself and his comrades who were\r\nthus beset. After three days, the ice slackened, and the Neptune\r\nboats, together with those belonging to the Earl Percy, left the\r\nJohn, although neither the sea nor their ships were visible. In this\r\nadventure they proved successful. When they had rowed many hours to\r\nthe south-eastward, they discovered a ship, on their approach to\r\nwhich they were invited on board, and received some refreshment.\r\nAfter this, having received information of the relative situation\r\nof their ships, they put off, and soon after had the happiness of\r\nregaining their respective vessels. This circumstance, which was the\r\noccasion of so much anxiety, danger, and loss of time to the crews of\r\nthe Neptune and Earl Percy, proved the contrary to the people of the\r\nJohn, as they added to her cargo seventeen whales, within the space\r\nof five days, and on the sixth, the ice having again slackened, they\r\nmade their escape into a place of safety.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Polar regions becomes a source of danger to the\r\nwhale-fishers when boats are separated from the ship to which they\r\nbelong, in foggy weather when they are overtaken by a storm and\r\nprevented from joining their ship, and when the people in the boats\r\nare long exposed to inclement winds.\r\n\r\nOn the commencement of a heavy gale of wind, May 11th, 1813, fourteen\r\nmen put off in a boat from the Volunteer, of Whitby, with the view\r\nof setting an anchor in a large piece of ice, to which it was their\r\nintention to moor the ship. The ship approached; on a signal being\r\nmade the sails were clewed up, and a rope fixed to the anchor, but\r\nthe ice shivering with the violence of the strain, when the ship fell\r\nastern the anchor flew out, and the ship went adrift. The sails being\r\nagain set, the ship was reached to the eastward, (wind at north,) the\r\ndistance of about two miles, but in attempting to wear and return,\r\nthe ship, instead of performing the evolution, scudded a considerable\r\ndistance to leeward, and was then reached out to sea, thus leaving\r\nfourteen of her crew to a fate most dreadful, the fulfilment of\r\nwhich seemed inevitable. The temperature of the air was 15° or 16°\r\nof Fahrenheit, when these poor men were left upon a detached piece\r\nof ice, without food, without shelter from the inclement storm, and\r\ndeprived of every means of refuge, except in a single boat, which,\r\non account of the number of men, and violence of the storm, was\r\nincapable of conveying them to their ship. Death stared them in the\r\nface whichever way they turned, and a division in opinion ensued.\r\n\r\nSome were wishful to remain by the ice, but the ice could afford them\r\nno shelter from the piercing wind, and would probably be soon broken\r\nto pieces by the increasing swell; others were anxious to attempt\r\nto join their ship, while she was yet in sight, but the force of\r\nthe wind, the violence of the sea, and the smallness of the boat in\r\ncomparison of the number of men to be conveyed, were objections which\r\nwould have appeared utterly insurmountable to any persons but men in\r\na state of despair. Judging that by remaining on the ice death was\r\nbut retarded for a few hours, as the extreme cold must eventually\r\nbenumb their faculties, and invite a sleep which would overcome the\r\nremains of animation, they determined on making the attempt to row\r\nto their ship. Poor creatures! what must have been their sensations\r\nat this moment, when the spark of hope yet remaining was so feeble\r\nthat a premature death even to themselves seemed inevitable. They\r\nmade the daring experiment, when a few minutes’ trial convinced them\r\nthat the attempt was utterly impracticable. They then, with longing\r\neyes, turned their efforts towards recovering the ice they had left,\r\nbut their utmost exertions were unavailing. Every one now viewed his\r\nsituation as desperate, and anticipated as certain the fatal event\r\nthat was to put a period to his life. How great must have been their\r\ndelight, and how overpowering their sensations, when, at this most\r\ncritical juncture, a ship appeared in sight! She was advancing\r\ndirectly towards them; their voices were extended, and their flag\r\ndisplayed. But although it was impossible they should be heard, it\r\nwas not impossible they should be seen. Their flag was descried by\r\nthe people on board the ship, their courses were so directed as to\r\nform the speediest union, and in a few minutes they found themselves\r\non the deck of the Lively, of Whitby, under circumstances of safety.\r\nThey received from their townsmen the warmest congratulations, and\r\nwhile each individual was forward in contributing his assistance\r\ntowards the restoration of their benumbed bodies, each of the rescued\r\nappeared sensible that their narrow escape from death was highly\r\nprovidential.\r\n\r\nThe forbearance of God is wonderful. Perhaps these very men a few\r\nhours before were impiously invoking their own destruction, or\r\nventing imprecations upon their fellow-beings. True it is, the\r\ngoodness of the Almighty extendeth over all his works, and that\r\nwhile “he delighteth in mercy” he is “slow to anger.” It is no\r\nexaggeration to affirm, that every guilty soul of man unpardoned and\r\nuncleansed through the blood of the Mediator, is exposed to a peril\r\nequally portentous with that which threatened these fishermen. God\r\nhas, however, provided an ark of mercy, floating on the billows of\r\nlife’s tempestuous, dangerous ocean, within which every soul may\r\nfind perfect and permanent peace. That ark is even now present, and\r\nentrance to it may be instantly secured. To delay is to increase the\r\nperil, perhaps beyond the possibility of future relief. “Behold, now\r\nis the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” Reader,\r\nenter into this ark of mercy by faith in the Lord Jesus!\r\n\r\nOne of the most calamitous events which in modern times has occurred\r\nin the fishery, was that which happened to the crew of the Ipswich,\r\ncaptain Gordon, about fifteen years ago. A whale was struck and\r\nkilled by the Ipswich’s people early in the spring of the year, a\r\nseason in which the weather is most uncertain. A storm commenced,\r\naccompanied with snow, before the capture was completed, but\r\nnevertheless the fish was taken to the ship, and having shelter from\r\nthe ice it was flensed. Meanwhile, four boats’ crews were employed\r\non a piece of ice, in hauling in the lines of the fast-boats, etc.,\r\nduring the performance of which duties the ship drifted out of sight\r\nof them. Every effort was then made by the captain for discovering\r\nthese unhappy men, who, being above twenty in number, constituted\r\nnearly half of his crew. But the weather continuing thick and stormy,\r\nand the frost most intense, it is probable that they all perished\r\nbefore the conclusion of the gale; at least none of them were saved,\r\nnor can I learn that any of their bodies were ever found.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable property of oil in smoothing the surface of the sea\r\nwhen considerably agitated, and of preventing breakers in the main\r\nocean, was sometimes resorted to by the ancient whale-fishers for\r\ntheir preservation, when overtaken by storms at sea. It was not\r\nunusual, I believe, a century ago, for every whale-boat to carry\r\nalong with it a keg of oil for this very purpose; which oil, being\r\nslowly poured overboard in a storm, afforded a sort of defence to\r\nthe boat as it drifted to leeward. The height of the waves, it is\r\ntrue, is not affected by the action of the oil, but as it intercepts\r\nthe attraction which dry air possesses for water, it prevents the\r\nimmediate action of the wind, quells the ruffled surface of the\r\nwaves, and in a great degree prevents the tendency to breakers, which\r\nconstitutes the principal danger in a storm.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive source of danger to the whale-fisher, when\r\nactively engaged in his occupation, arises from the object of his\r\npursuit. The fisher is liable to receive contusions from oars\r\nforcibly struck by the fish, or from direct blows from its fins or\r\ntail; he is liable to accidents from getting entangled by the lines,\r\nor from the boat being drawn under water by the fish through the\r\nmedium of the lines; and he is in danger of being thrown overboard\r\nby the heeling or jerking of the boat, or more particularly from the\r\nboat being stove, upset, sunk, or projected into the air, by the\r\nforce of a blow from the whale.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the John, of Greenock, who was in a fast-boat in\r\nthe fishery of 1818, unfortunately slipped his foot through a coil of\r\nline in the act of running out, which drew him forward to the boat’s\r\nstern, and separated his foot by the ancle. He was conveyed by the\r\nfirst boat to the ship, where the assistance of several surgeons\r\nbeing procured, the lower part of the leg was cut off. After this,\r\nthe poor fellow, having received the most unremitting attention from\r\ncaptain Jackson, with the best sustenance and accommodation the ship\r\ncould afford, was restored to health, and his wound nearly healed\r\nbefore the conclusion of the voyage. It is worthy of being remarked,\r\nthat the captain and crew of the John subscribed upwards of £24 for\r\nhis relief, which was increased by the owners of the ship and others,\r\non arrival, to about £37. This sum was placed in the “Provident\r\nBank,” at Greenock, from whence he was permitted to draw it, after\r\nthe rate of 7_s._ per week.\r\n\r\nA harpooner, belonging to the Henrietta, of Whitby, when engaged\r\nin lancing a whale, into which he had previously struck a harpoon,\r\nincautiously cast a little line under his feet that he had just\r\nhauled into the boat, after it had been drawn out by the fish. A\r\npainful stroke of his lance induced the whale to dart suddenly\r\ndownward, his line began to run out from beneath his feet, and in an\r\ninstant caught him by a turn round his body. He had but just time\r\nto call out, “Clear away the line!”—“Oh dear!” when he was almost\r\ncut asunder, dragged overboard, and drowned. The line was cut at\r\nthe moment, but without avail. The fish descended a considerable\r\ndepth and died, from whence it was drawn to the surface by the lines\r\nconnected with it, and secured.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of June, 1811, a boat from the ship Resolution, commanded\r\nat the time by myself, put off in pursuit of a whale, and was rowed\r\nupon its back. At the moment that it was harpooned, it struck the\r\nside of the boat a violent blow with its tail, the shock of which\r\nthrew the boat-steerer to some distance into the water. A repetition\r\nof the blow projected the harpooner and line-manager in a similar\r\nway, and completely drenched the part of the crew remaining in the\r\nboat with the sprays. One of the men regained the boat, but, as the\r\nfish immediately sank and drew the boat away from the place, his\r\ntwo companions in misfortune were soon left far beyond the reach of\r\nassistance. The harpooner, though a practised swimmer, felt himself\r\nso bruised and enervated by a blow he had received on the chest, that\r\nhe was totally incapacitated from giving the least support to his\r\nfellow-sufferer. The ship being happily near, a boat, which had been\r\nlowered on the first alarm, arrived to their succour at the moment\r\nwhen the line-manager, who was unacquainted with the art of swimming,\r\nwas on the point of sinking to rise no more. Both the line-manager\r\nand harpooner were preserved; and the fish, after a few hours’ close\r\npursuit, was subdued.\r\n\r\nWhile the same ship navigated an open lake of water in the 81° north\r\nlat., during a keen frost and strong north wind, on the 2nd of June,\r\n1806, a whale appeared, and a boat put off in pursuit. On its second\r\nvisit to the surface of the sea it was harpooned. A convulsive heave\r\nof the tail which succeeded the wound struck the boat at the stern,\r\nand, by its reaction, projected the boat-steerer overboard. As the\r\nline in a moment dragged the boat beyond his reach, the crew threw\r\nsome of their oars towards him for his support, one of which he\r\nhappily seized. The ships and boats being at a considerable distance,\r\nand the fast-boat being rapidly drawn away from him, the harpooner\r\ncut the line, with the view of rescuing him from his dangerous\r\nsituation. But no sooner was this act performed than, to their\r\nextreme mortification, they discovered, in consequence of some oars\r\nbeing thrown towards their floating comrades, and others being broken\r\nor unshipped by the blow from the fish, one oar only remained, with\r\nwhich, owing to the force of the wind, they tried in vain to approach\r\nhim. A considerable period elapsed before any boat from the ship\r\ncould afford him assistance, though the men strained every nerve for\r\nthe purpose. At length, when they reached him, he was found with his\r\narms stretched over an oar, almost deprived of sensation. On his\r\narrival at the ship he was in a deplorable condition. His clothes\r\nwere frozen like mail, and his hair constituted a helmet of ice. He\r\nwas immediately conveyed into the cabin, his clothes taken off, his\r\nlimbs and body dried and well rubbed, and a cordial administered to\r\nhim. A dry shirt and stockings were then put upon him, and he was\r\nlaid in the captain’s bed. After a few hours’ sleep, he awoke, and\r\nappeared considerably relieved. He complained of a painful sensation\r\nof cold. He was therefore removed to his own berth, and one of his\r\nmessmates ordered to lie on each side of him, whereby the diminished\r\ncirculation of the blood was accelerated, and the animal heat\r\nrestored. The shock on his constitution, however, was greater than\r\nwas anticipated. He recovered in the course of a few days so as to\r\nbe able to engage in his ordinary pursuits, but many months elapsed\r\nbefore his countenance exhibited its wonted appearance of health.\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of the power which the whale possesses in its\r\ntail was exhibited within my own observation, in the year 1807.\r\nOn the 29th of May, a whale was harpooned by an officer belonging\r\nto the Resolution. It descended a considerable depth, and on its\r\nreappearance evidenced an uncommon degree of irritation. It made\r\nsuch a display of its fins and tail, that few of the crew were hardy\r\nenough to approach it. The captain, (my father,) observing their\r\ntimidity, called a boat, and himself struck the second harpoon.\r\nAnother boat immediately followed, and, unhappily, advanced too\r\nfar. The tail was again reared into the air in a terrific attitude.\r\nThe impending blow was evident. The harpooner, who was directly\r\nunderneath, leaped overboard. At the next moment, the threatened\r\nstroke was impressed on the centre of the boat, which buried it in\r\nthe water. Happily no one was injured. The harpooner, who leaped\r\noverboard, escaped certain death by the act, the tail having struck\r\nthe very spot on which he stood. The effects of the blow were\r\nastonishing. The keel was broken, the gunwales and every plank,\r\nexcepting two, were cut through, and it was evident the boat would\r\nhave been completely divided had not the tail struck directly upon a\r\ncoil of lines. The boat was rendered useless.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch ship, Gort-Moolen, commanded by Cornelius Gerard Ouwekaas,\r\nwith a cargo of seven fish, was anchored in Greenland, in the year\r\n1660. The captain, perceiving a whale ahead of his ship, beckoned\r\nhis attendants, and threw himself into a boat. He was the first to\r\napproach the whale, and succeeded in harpooning it before the arrival\r\nof the second boat, which was on the advance. Jacques Vienkes, who\r\nhad the direction of it, joined his captain immediately afterwards,\r\nand prepared to make a second attack on the fish when it should\r\nremount to the surface. At the moment of its ascension, the boat of\r\nVienkes happening unhappily to be perpendicularly above it, was so\r\nsuddenly and forcibly lifted up by a stroke of the head of the whale,\r\nthat it was dashed to pieces before the harpooner could discharge\r\nhis weapon. Vienkes flew along with the pieces of the boat, and fell\r\nupon the back of the animal. This intrepid seaman, who still retained\r\nhis weapon in his grasp, harpooned the whale on which he stood, and\r\nby means of the harpoon and the line, which he never abandoned, he\r\nsteadied himself firmly upon the fish, notwithstanding his hazardous\r\nsituation, and regardless of a considerable wound that he received\r\nin his leg, in his fall along with the fragments of the boat. All\r\nthe efforts of the other boats to approach the whale and deliver\r\nthe harpooner were futile. The captain, not seeing any other method\r\nof saving his companion, who was in some way entangled with the\r\nline, called to him to cut it with his knife, and betake himself to\r\nswimming. Vienkes, embarrassed and disconcerted as he was, tried\r\nin vain to follow this counsel. His knife was in the pocket of his\r\ndrawers, and, being unable to support himself with one hand, he could\r\nnot get it out. The whale meanwhile continued advancing along the\r\nsurface of the water with great rapidity, but happily never attempted\r\nto dive. While his comrades despaired of his life, the harpoon by\r\nwhich he held at length disengaged itself from the body of the\r\nwhale. Vienkes, being then liberated, did not fail to take advantage\r\nof this circumstance. He cast himself into the sea, and, by swimming,\r\nendeavoured to regain the boats which continued the pursuit of the\r\nwhale. When his shipmates perceived him struggling with the waves,\r\nthey redoubled their exertions. They reached him just as his strength\r\nwas exhausted, and had the happiness of rescuing this adventurous\r\nharpooner from his perilous situation.\r\n\r\nIn one of my earliest voyages to the whale-fishery, I observed a\r\ncircumstance which excited my highest astonishment. One of our\r\nharpooners had struck a whale; it dived, and all the assisting boats\r\nhad collected round the fast-boat before it rose to the surface. The\r\nfirst boat which approached it advanced incautiously upon it. It rose\r\nwith unexpected violence beneath the boat, and projected it and all\r\nits crew to the height of some yards in the air. It fell on its side,\r\nupset, and cast all the men into the water. One man received a severe\r\nblow in his fall, and appeared to be dangerously injured; but, soon\r\nafter his arrival on board of the ship, he recovered from the effects\r\nof the accident. The rest of the boat’s crew escaped without any hurt.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lyons, of the Raith, of Leith, while prosecuting the\r\nwhale-fishery on the Labrador coast, in the season of 1802,\r\ndiscovered a large whale at a short distance from the ship. Four\r\nboats were dispatched in pursuit, and two of them succeeded in\r\napproaching it so closely together, that two harpoons were struck at\r\nthe same moment. The fish descended a few fathoms in the direction\r\nof another of the boats, which was on the advance, rose accidentally\r\nbeneath it, struck it with its head, and threw the boat, men, and\r\napparatus, about fifteen feet into the air. It was inverted by the\r\nstroke, and fell into the water with its keel upwards. All the\r\npeople were picked up alive by the fourth boat, which was just at\r\nhand, excepting one man, who, having got entangled in the boat, fell\r\nbeneath it, and was drowned. The fish was soon afterwards killed.\r\n\r\nWhen a ship has on board an ample cargo, or when the fogs set in, and\r\nthe whales totally disappear, so as to put a period to the fishery\r\nfor that season, there remains no sufficient motive to induce further\r\nstay in the country; the course of each ship is therefore directed\r\nimmediately homeward. On the arrival of a fishing-ship at the port\r\nfrom whence she sailed, the mustering-officer of the customs repairs\r\non board, receives the manifest of the cargo, (which is a kind of\r\nschedule in writing, containing all particulars respecting it,) with\r\na true copy thereof, examines into the identity and number of the\r\ncrew, by the usual form of mustering, and places an officer or two\r\non board, to take charge of the cargo on the part of the revenue.\r\nThe duty of these officers is to take account of every cask or\r\nother article of which the cargo consists, as it is discharged from\r\nthe ship, and one of them accompanies the same to its destination,\r\ncarrying an account thereof in writing, and not quitting the lighter,\r\nwherein it is contained, until he is relieved by another officer, who\r\nis placed in the capacity of landing-waiter on the premises where the\r\nblubber is warehoused or boiled.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours after the ship arrives in port, the master\r\nis required, under the penalty of one hundred pounds, to attend at\r\nthe custom-house to make his report; that is, to make affidavit\r\nof the built, burden, and cargo of the ship he commands; on which\r\noccasion he must deliver his manifest to the collector or other\r\nchief officer, (if it has not before been demanded of him,) under\r\nthe penalty of two hundred pounds. At the same time, the log-book\r\nmust be produced, and its contents, as required by law, verified on\r\nthe oath of the master and mate, and affidavit also made by the same\r\npersons of their faithful dealings according to the requirements\r\nof the law during the voyage. After these things are accomplished,\r\nthe mustering-officer’s certificate and schedule of the crew, the\r\ncommissioners’ license, and the affidavits of master and mate are\r\ntransmitted to the commissioners, who, being satisfied of the\r\nfaithfulness of all the proceedings, are required to order payment of\r\nthe bounty on demand.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the cargo being admitted to entry, free from the duties\r\nimposed on the produce of foreign fishery, the owner, importer, or\r\nconsignee of the cargo, together with the master or commander of the\r\nvessel, must severally make oath, each to the best of his knowledge\r\nand belief, that the said cargo was the produce of fish, etc.,\r\nactually caught by the crew of a British-built vessel, wholly owned\r\nby her Majesty’s subjects, usually residing in Great Britain, etc.,\r\nregistered and navigated according to law. The importer or consignee\r\nof any goods imported into Britain is required, within twenty\r\ndays after the master should have made his report, under certain\r\npenalties, to make a due entry with the collector or other chief\r\nofficer of the customs, at the port where the ship shall arrive,\r\nof all the goods by him imported therein, and pay the full duties\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n ACCOUNT OF THE DAVIS’S STRAIT WHALE-FISHERY, WITH STATEMENTS OF\r\n EXPENSES AND PROFITS OF A FISHING-SHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nShips intended for Davis’s Strait commonly put to sea a little\r\nearlier than the Greenland ships. Some years ago, they were in the\r\nhabit of sailing in the latter part of February, but at present they\r\nseldom leave their ports before the beginning or middle of March.\r\nOn their passage outward, the Davis’s Strait fishers usually touch\r\nat Orkney or Shetland, for the purpose of procuring men, and such\r\ntrifling stores as are furnished at a cheap rate in these islands,\r\ntogether with a view of trimming and preparing their vessels for\r\naccomplishing the passage across the Atlantic. In consequence of\r\nthe frequent storms and high seas which prevail in the spring of\r\nthe year, the passage across the Atlantic is often attended with\r\ndifficulty. The whalers are constantly liable to meet with icebergs,\r\nafter passing the meridian of Cape Farewell, up to their arrival at\r\nthe face of the ice connected with the shore of Labrador. In the\r\nnight, or in thick weather, they are particularly hazardous, and\r\nespecially in storms. In moderate winds, indeed, such an intimation\r\nof their proximity is to be obtained, either from their natural\r\neffulgence in some states of the atmosphere, or from their intense\r\nblackness in others, that they can be generally avoided. But in\r\nstorms, when the ship ceases to be under command, they become one of\r\nthe most appalling dangers which can be presented to the navigator.\r\n\r\nTwo most fatal shipwrecks occurred in the Davis’s Strait fleets; the\r\nRoyalist, captain Edmonds, and the London, captain Matthews, were\r\nlost, with all hands; the former among icebergs, in 1814, and the\r\nlatter, as it is supposed, in a similar way, in 1817. Captain Bennet,\r\nof the Venerable, was in company with the Royalist immediately\r\nbefore she was wrecked. They fell in with drift-ice at eight A.M.,\r\nApril the 14th, when a heavy gale of wind commenced, and continued\r\ntwelve hours, after which the wind abated, but suddenly veering to\r\nthe north-west, a tremendous storm arose, which, accompanied with\r\nsleet and snow, continued without intermission during twenty hours.\r\nBefore dark of the 15th, (nautical day,) captain Bennet saw several\r\nicebergs, at which time he believed the Royalist was lying to\r\nwindward of an extensive chain of these islands of ice, among which\r\nshe was wrecked in the course of the same night. The crew probably\r\nperished immediately, as the sea was uncommonly high. In the case\r\nboth of the Royalist and the London subscriptions were generously\r\nopened at Hull, by the owners of the whalers, for the relief of the\r\nbereaved relatives of the crew.\r\n\r\nThe fishery on the coast of Labrador commences occasionally in the\r\nmonth of March. On this station, which is inhabited by a large\r\ndescription of whales, some fishers have persevered altogether, and\r\nhave sometimes procured great cargoes. It is, however, a dangerous\r\nfishery. The nights being long and dark on their first arrival, they\r\nare obliged to use lanterns in their boats, when fish happen to be\r\nstruck, or to remain unsubdued at close of day, for the purpose\r\nof keeping the ships and boats together; on which occasions the\r\nstormy weather that frequently occurs at this season exposes them to\r\ncontinued danger. Those who prosecute the northern fishery, after\r\nmaking the ice at the “south-west,” as the neighbourhood of the\r\nLabrador coast is usually denominated, proceed almost immediately\r\nup Davis’s Strait towards Baffin’s Bay. If in the month of April\r\nor beginning of May they commence this navigation, and sail along\r\nthe edge of the western ice to the northward, they often find it\r\njoining the ice connected with the west coast of Greenland, in the\r\nlatitude 66½° or 67°, and meet with a considerable barrier of it\r\nin 68°, immediately beyond which, a few leagues from land, is a\r\ngood fishing-station. As the ice opens to the northward, the whales\r\nretreat in that direction, and the fishers follow as promptly as\r\npossible. The whalers often reach Disko early in May, but it is\r\ngenerally the latter end of this month, or the beginning of June,\r\nbefore they can pass the second barrier of ice, lying about Hare\r\nIsland, in the 71st degree of latitude, and enter the northern inlets\r\nfrequented by the whales. The three inlets called the South-east\r\nBay, Jacob’s Bight, and the North-east Bay, were most productive\r\nfishing-stations some years ago, but of late they have afforded but\r\nfew whales. From hence, if no fish are found, the whalers proceed\r\nto the western part of the strait, towards Cumberland Island, or\r\npersevere along the east side of Davis’s Strait towards Baffin’s\r\nBay, to the eastern parts of which the fish appear to retreat as the\r\nseason advances, and as the ice clears away from the northern and\r\neastern shores.\r\n\r\nIn Baffin’s Bay, and in the inlets of West Greenland, the fishery\r\nis conducted under the most favourable circumstances. The water\r\nbeing shallow in many situations, the boats require only a small\r\nquantity of line, and the weather being warm, the sailors perform\r\ntheir operations, if not with pleasure, at least with comfort to\r\nthemselves. But at the south-west, each operation of the fishery is\r\nperformed under rather unpleasant and even dangerous circumstances.\r\nDarkness of night, exposure to storms, and frequency of swells,\r\nare all unfavourable to the fishers. The flensing of a whale at\r\nthe south-west is usually more troublesome and more hazardous than\r\nelsewhere, owing to the prevalent swell, which rarely altogether\r\nsubsides.\r\n\r\nDavis’s Strait fishers, within the present century, after making a\r\nsuccessful fishery at a distance from land, have been in the habit of\r\nresorting to the bays, there mooring in safety, until the troublesome\r\nprocess of making-off was accomplished. On the passage homewards,\r\nthe ships usually steer down the middle of the strait, and proceed\r\nsufficiently far south for avoiding the “Cape-ice,” before they haul\r\nup to the eastward. From thence, the prevalence of westerly winds in\r\nthe summer season generally affords them an easy passage across the\r\nAtlantic. The legislative regulations on the importation of Davis’s\r\nStrait produce are the same as on cargoes obtained in the Greenland\r\nfishery.\r\n\r\nAmong the Dutch fishers, we find that, during a period of a hundred\r\nand seven years, included between 1669 and 1778, each ship in a\r\nfleet of a hundred and thirty-two sail, which proceeded annually to\r\nGreenland, afforded to the owners, on an average, a profit of 3,126\r\nflorins; and that, in a period of sixty years, ending with 1778, a\r\nfleet of fifty-three ships, which sailed annually to Davis’s Strait,\r\nrealized to the owners a profit of 3,469 florins per voyage; thus\r\nexceeding the produce of the Greenland fishery by 343 florins on each\r\nship, per voyage, after ample allowance is made for the greater\r\nlength of the voyage to Davis’s Strait, together with the additional\r\nwear and tear. Among the British fishers, the advantage seems also to\r\nhave been on the side of Davis’s Strait, particularly of late years.\r\nBut if we deduct the value of skins taken by the Greenland fishers,\r\nbut not estimated in their cargoes, say £20 to £30 per ship, and the\r\nadditional expenses of a Davis’s Strait voyage, occasioned by the\r\ngreater wear and tear, and the provisions and wages for a voyage,\r\nlonger by one or two months than that to Greenland, we shall reduce\r\nthe balance in favour of the Davis’s Strait fishers to a very small\r\nsum.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years, ending with 1817, the amount of the cargoes\r\nof the British Greenland whale-fishing ships, (consisting of three\r\nhundred and seventy-six sail, repeated voyages included,) was\r\n3,508 whales, which produced 33,070 tuns of oil, and 1,682 tons of\r\nwhalebone. At the same time, 210 ships employed in the Davis’s Strait\r\nfishery procured 1,522 whales, yielding 21,438 tuns of oil, and 1,015\r\ntons of whale-fins. It seems worthy of remark, that the whales caught\r\nnear Spitzbergen afforded a larger proportion of whalebone, compared\r\nwith the quantity of oil, than the fish of Davis’s Strait; the\r\nGreenland fish yielding a ton of fins for every 19½ tuns of oil, and\r\nthe Davis’s Strait fish a ton of fins for every 21 tuns of oil. It\r\nis remarkable that this should have been the case, when we consider\r\nthat small fish afford less whalebone than large fish in proportion\r\nto their produce in oil, and yet the Greenland fish, which, on\r\nthe average of four years, were much smaller than those caught in\r\nDavis’s Strait, have produced the largest proportion of whalebone.\r\nThe whales taken at the Greenland fishery in four years only average\r\n9½ tuns of oil each, but those caught at Davis’s Strait average 14\r\ntuns. It would, therefore, appear that the large whales caught near\r\nSpitzbergen are much stouter than those taken in Davis’s Strait, and\r\nafford such a large proportion of fins as more than compensates for\r\nthe deficiency in the small whales.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuating value of shipping renders it difficult to give a\r\nfair estimate of the expenses of a whale-ship. The Resolution,\r\nof Whitby, burden 219 tons, when new, in the year 1803, cost but\r\n£7,791, including all expenses of stores and outfit, premiums of\r\ninsurance, and advanced money of seamen; while the Esk, of 354 tons\r\nof measurement, launched and fitted out at the same port in 1813,\r\ncost about £14,000. The ship Resolution was sold in eight shares,\r\nand the sums subscribed by the owners and deposited in the hands of\r\nthe managing owners was £8,000. The balance in favour of the owners\r\nof the Resolution for fifteen voyages appeared to be £19,473. 10_s._\r\n2_d._, besides the value of the ship, and the value of the outfit\r\nfor the sixteenth voyage. If we reckon these at £6,520, the profit\r\nderived from £8,000, originally advanced, in addition to the interest\r\nof the capital embarked, will amount to £26,000, notwithstanding the\r\nlast three voyages were but indifferent, of which sum £25,200 has\r\nactually been divided. It is, however, necessary to mention, that the\r\nResolution, in her first ten voyages, procured six hundred or seven\r\nhundred tuns of oil above the average of the fishery during that\r\nperiod, if not more.\r\n\r\nThe usual expenses of a Greenland voyage, including outfit, when no\r\ncargo is obtained, may be stated at £2,200, exclusive of interest\r\nof capital and wear and tear. For every ten tuns of oil procured,\r\nthere will be an additional expense of £80 or £90 for discharging\r\nand boiling the cargo, for oil money and fish money, and for other\r\nextraordinaries connected with a successful fishing. Thus the expense\r\nof a ship, with a cargo of two hundred tuns of oil, will be at least\r\n£4,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n METHOD OF EXTRACTING OIL AND PREPARING WHALE-BONE, WITH A\r\n DESCRIPTION OF THESE ARTICLES, AND REMARKS ON THE USES TO WHICH THE\r\n SEVERAL PRODUCTS OF THE WHALE-FISHERY ARE APPLIED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the margin of the river, wet dock, canal, or other sheet of water,\r\ncommunicating with that wherein the whale-fishing ship discharges her\r\ncargo, are usually provided the necessary premises for reducing the\r\nblubber into oil, consisting commonly of the following articles.\r\n\r\n1. A copper vessel or boiler, three to six, or even ten or more tuns’\r\ncapacity, of a circular form in the horizontal view, and elliptical\r\nin the perpendicular section, is fixed at the elevation of six to\r\nten feet above the ground, provided with an appropriate furnace, and\r\ncovered with a tiled or slated shed.\r\n\r\n2. On the same, or on a little lower level than that of the\r\ncopper, is fixed a square or oblong back or cooler, built of wood\r\ngenerally, capable of containing from ten to twenty tuns of oil, or\r\nupwards. Adjoining to this is another back, sometimes a third, and\r\noccasionally a fourth or fifth, each placed a little lower than the\r\none preceding it, so that the lowest shall stand with its base about\r\ntwo or three feet above the level of the ground. In some very modern\r\n_works_, the coolers are all fixed at the same elevation. Each of the\r\nbacks is provided with one or more stop-cocks on the most accessible\r\nside, for convenience in drawing the oil off into casks.\r\n\r\n3. Altogether above the level of the copper, and immediately\r\nadjoining it, on the side directed towards the river or canal,\r\nan oblong wooden cistern, called the “starting-back,” is usually\r\nerected, for containing blubber, which ought to be a vessel of equal,\r\nor nearly equal, capacity to that of the copper. It is generally\r\nprovided with a crane, which, with a winch, or other similar engine\r\nattached, is so contrived as to take casks either from the quay, or\r\nfrom a lighter by the side of the quay, and convey them at once to\r\nthe top of the starting-back. Over this vessel is extended a kind of\r\nrailing or “gauntree,” on which the casks rest without being injured,\r\nand are easily movable.\r\n\r\n4. The starting-back being elevated two or three yards above the\r\nlevel of the ground, occasionally admits of a “fenk-back,” or\r\ndepository, for the refuse of the blubber, immediately beneath it;\r\nwhich fenk-back is sometimes provided with a _clough_ on the side\r\nnext the water, for “starting” the fenks into a barge or lighter\r\nplaced below.\r\n\r\n5. The premises likewise comprise a _shed_ for the cooper, and\r\nsometimes a cooper’s, or master-boiler’s, dwelling-house; the\r\ninhabitant of which takes the charge of all the blubber, oil,\r\nwhalebone, and other articles deposited around him.\r\n\r\n6. Warehouses for containing the oil after it is drawn off into casks\r\nare also used, not only for preserving it in safe custody, but for\r\ndefending the casks from the rays of the sun, otherwise they are apt\r\nto pine and become leaky, and,\r\n\r\n7. Sometimes “steeping-backs” and apparatus for preparing whalebone\r\nare comprised within the same inclosure.\r\n\r\nThe blubber, which was originally in the state of fat, is found,\r\non arrival in a warm climate, to be in a great measure resolved\r\ninto oil. The casks, containing the blubber, are conveyed, by\r\nthe mechanical apparatus above mentioned, to the top of the\r\nstarting-back, into which their contents are emptied or _started_\r\nthrough the bungholes. When the copper is properly cleansed, the\r\ncontents of the starting-back, on lifting a clough at the extremity,\r\nor turning a stop-cock, fall directly into the copper, one edge of\r\nwhich is usually placed beneath. The copper is filled within two or\r\nthree inches of the top, a little space being requisite to admit\r\nof the expansion of the oil when heated; and then a brisk fire is\r\napplied to the furnace, and continued until the oil begins to boil.\r\nThis effect usually takes place in less than two hours. Many of\r\nthe fritters or fenks float on the surface of the oil before it\r\nis heated, but after it is “boiled off,” the whole, or nearly so,\r\nsubside to the bottom. From the time the copper begins to warm until\r\nit is boiled off, or ceases to boil, its contents must be incessantly\r\nstirred by means of a pole, armed with a kind of broad, blunt chisel,\r\nto prevent the fenks from adhering to the bottom or sides of the\r\nvessel. When once the contents of the copper boil, the fire in the\r\nfurnace is immediately reduced, and shortly afterwards altogether\r\nwithdrawn. Some persons allow the copper to boil an hour, others\r\nduring two or three hours. The former practice is supposed to produce\r\nfiner and paler oil, the latter a greater quantity. The same copper\r\nis usually boiled twice in every twenty-four hours, Sundays excepted.\r\nAfter the oil has stood to cool and subside, the “bailing” process\r\ncommences. One of the backs or coolers having been prepared for the\r\nreception of the oil, by putting into it a quantity of water, for\r\nthe double purpose of preventing the heat of the oil from warping\r\nor rending the back, and for receiving any impurities which it may\r\nhappen to hold in suspension, a wooden spout, with a large square\r\nbox-like head, which head is filled with brushwood or broom, that\r\nit may act as a filter, is then placed along from “the copper-head”\r\nto the cooler, so as to form a communication between the two. The\r\noil in the copper being now separated from the fenks, water, and\r\nother impurities, all of which have subsided to the bottom, is in a\r\ngreat measure run off through the pipe communicating with the cooler,\r\nand the remainder is carefully lifted in copper or tin ladles, and\r\npoured upon the broom in the spout, from whence it runs into the same\r\ncooler, or any other cooler, at the pleasure of the “boilers.”\r\n\r\nBesides oil and fenks, the blubber of the whale likewise affords a\r\nconsiderable quantity of watery liquor, produced probably from the\r\nputrescence of the blood, on the surface of which some of the fenks,\r\nand all the greasy animal matter, called foot-je, or footing, float,\r\nand upon the top of these the oil. Great care therefore is requisite,\r\non approaching these impure substances, to take the oil off by\r\nmeans of shallow tinned iron or copper ladles, called “skimmers,”\r\nwithout disturbing the refuse and mixing it with the oil. There must\r\nalways, however, be a small quantity towards the conclusion, which\r\nis a mixture of oil and footing; such is put into a cask or other\r\nsuitable vessel by itself, and when the greasy part has thoroughly\r\nsubsided, the most pure part is skimmed off and becomes fine oil, and\r\nthe impure is allowed to accumulate by itself, in another vessel,\r\nwhere in the end it affords “brown-oil.” From a ton, or 252 gallons\r\nby measure of blubber, there generally arises from fifty to sixty\r\ngallons of refuse, whereof the greater part is a watery fluid.\r\nThe constant presence of this fluid, which boils at a much lower\r\ntemperature than the oil, prevents the oil itself from boiling,\r\nwhich is probably an advantage, since, in the event of the oil being\r\nboiled, some of the finest and most inflammable parts would fly off\r\nin the form of vapour, whereas the principal part of the steam,\r\nwhich now escapes, is produced from the water. Some persons make a\r\npractice of adding a quantity of water, amounting perhaps to half a\r\ntun, to the contents of each copper, with the view of weakening or\r\nattenuating the viscid impurities contained in the blubber, and thus\r\nobtaining a finer oil; others consider the quantity of watery fluid\r\nalready in the blubber, as sufficient for producing every needful\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nEach day, immediately after the copper is emptied, and while it is\r\nyet hot, the men employed in the manufacture of the oil, having their\r\nfeet defended by strong leathern or wooden shoes, descend into it,\r\nand scour it out with sand and water, until they restore the natural\r\nsurface of the copper wherever it is discoloured. This serves to\r\npreserve the oil from becoming high-coloured, which will always be\r\nthe case when proper cleanliness is not observed.\r\n\r\nWhen prepared and cooled, the oil is in a marketable state, and\r\nrequires only to be transferred from the coolers into casks, for\r\nthe convenience of conveyance to any part of the country. Each of\r\nthe coolers, it has been observed, is furnished with a stop-cock,\r\nbeneath which there is a platform adapted for receiving the casks.\r\nAt the conclusion of the process of boiling each vessel’s cargo\r\nmanufactured on the premises, the backs are completely emptied of\r\ntheir contents. To effect this water is poured in, until the lower\r\npart of the stratum of oil rises within a few lines of the level of\r\nthe stop-cock, and permits the greatest part of the oil to escape.\r\nThe quantity left amounts, perhaps, to half an inch or an inch in\r\ndepth; to recover this oil without water requires a little address. A\r\ndeal board, in length a little exceeding the breadth of the cooler,\r\nis introduced at one end, diagonally, and placed, edge-ways, in\r\nits contents. The ends of the board being covered with flannel,\r\nwhen pressed forcibly against the two opposite sides of the cooler,\r\nprevent the oil from circulating past. The board is then advanced\r\nslowly forward towards the part of the back where the stop-cock\r\nis placed, and, in its progress, all the oil is collected by the\r\nboard, while the water has a free circulation beneath it. When the\r\noil accumulates to the depth of the board, its further motion is\r\nsuspended until the oil thus collected is drawn off. Another similar\r\nboard is afterwards introduced, at the furthest extremity of the\r\ncooler, and passed forward in the same manner, whereby the little\r\noil which escapes the first is collected. The remnant is taken up\r\nby skimmers. The smell of oil during its extraction is undoubtedly\r\ndisagreeable; but, perhaps, not more so than the vapour arising from\r\nany other animal substance, submitted to the action of heat when in\r\na putrid state. It is an erroneous opinion that a whale-ship must\r\nalways give out the same unpleasant smell. The fact is, that the fat\r\nof the whale, in its fresh state, has no offensive flavour whatever,\r\nand never becomes disagreeable until it is brought into a warm\r\nclimate, and becomes putrid.\r\n\r\nWhale-oil, prepared by the method just described, is of a pale\r\nhoney-yellow colour; but sometimes, when the blubber from which it\r\nis procured happens to be of the red kind, the oil appears of a\r\nreddish-brown colour. When first extracted, it is commonly thick,\r\nbut after standing some time a mucilaginous substance subsides, and\r\nit becomes tolerably limpid and transparent. Its smell is somewhat\r\noffensive, especially when it is long kept. It consists of oil,\r\nproperly so called, a small portion of spermaceti, and a little\r\ngelatine. At the temperature of 40° the latter substances become\r\npartially concrete, and make the oil obscure; and at the temperature\r\nof 32° render it thick with flaky crystals. It is sold by the tun,\r\nof 252 gallons, wine measure. Its specific gravity is 0·9214. The\r\ntun weighs 17 cwt. 1 qr. 1 lb. 12 oz. 14 dr. The value of whale-oil,\r\nlike that of every other similar article, is subject to continual\r\nvariations. In the year 1744, oil sold in England for £10. 1_s._ per\r\ntun; in 1754, for £29; in 1801, for £50; in 1807, for £21; and in\r\n1813, when the price was the highest ever obtained, for £55 or £60\r\nper tun.\r\n\r\nThe application of gas, produced by the distillation of coal, for\r\nlighting the public streets and buildings, manufactories, shops,\r\netc., which formerly were lighted with oil, it was apprehended\r\nwould be ruinous to the whale-fishery trade, and certainly had a\r\nvery threatening appearance; but hitherto, owing to the amount\r\nof whale-oil lately imported having been less than the ordinary\r\nquantity, this expected effect of the employment of gas-lights has\r\nnot been felt.\r\n\r\nWhen blubber is boiled in Greenland, the oil produced from it is\r\nmuch brighter, paler, more limpid, and more inflammable than that\r\nextracted in Britain. It is also totally free from any unpleasant\r\nflavour, and burns without smell. Hence it is evident, that whatever\r\nis disagreeable in the effluvia of whale-oil arises from an admixture\r\nof putrescent substances. These consist of blood and animal fibre.\r\nThis latter is the reticulated and cellular fibres of the blubber,\r\nwherein the oil is confined, which produces the fenks when boiled.\r\nWhen putrefaction commences, a small portion of the blood contained\r\nin the blubber is probably combined with the oil, and the animal\r\nfibre, in considerable quantity, is dissolved in it. These substances\r\nnot only occasion the unpleasant smell common to whale-oil, but,\r\nby being deposited on the wick of lamps, in burning, produce upon\r\nit a kind of cinder, which, if not occasionally removed, causes a\r\ngreat diminution in the quantity of light. A sample of oil, which\r\nI extracted in Greenland, about ten years ago, is still fine, and\r\ntotally free from rancidity. It has certainly acquired a smell,\r\nbut is not more unpleasant than that of old Florence oil. Hence,\r\nwere whale-oil extracted in Greenland before the putrefying process\r\ncommences, or were any method devised of freeing it from the\r\nimpurities which combine with it in consequence of this process, it\r\nwould become not only more valuable for common purposes, but would be\r\napplicable to almost every use to which spermaceti oil is adapted. In\r\nfact, it would become a similar kind of article.\r\n\r\nIn performing some experiments on oil in Greenland, during the\r\nfishing season of 1818, I adopted a process for refining oil\r\nextracted from blubber before the putrefying process commenced, by\r\nwhich I procured a remarkably fine oil. It was nearly colourless,\r\nbeautifully transparent, and very limpid. This oil retains its\r\ntransparency, even at a very low temperature. It is more inflammable\r\nthan spermaceti oil, and so pure, that it will burn longer, without\r\nforming a crust on the wick of the lamp, than any other oil with\r\nwhich it has been compared.\r\n\r\nBesides the oil produced from blubber by boiling, the whalers\r\ndistinguish such as oozes from the jawbones of the fish by the name\r\nof jawbone oil; and inferior oils, which are discoloured, by the\r\ndenominations of brown oil and black oil, or bilge oil. Brown oil is\r\nproduced in the way described in the process of boiling; black or\r\nbilge oil is that which leaks out of the casks in the course of the\r\nvoyage, or runs out of any blubber which may happen to be in bulk,\r\nand accumulates in the bottom of the ship. This oil is always very\r\ndark coloured, viscous, and possessed of little transparency.\r\n\r\nWhalebone, or whalefins, as the substance is sometimes, though\r\nincorrectly, named, is found in the mouth of the common Greenland\r\nwhale, to which it serves as a substitute for teeth. It forms an\r\napparatus most admirably adapted as a filter for separating the\r\nminute animals on which the whale feeds from the sea-water in which\r\nthey exist. The Lawgiver of all the creatures, whether rational or\r\nirrational, has fitted them with organization appropriate for the\r\npurposes for which they live, and has provided them with all that is\r\nneedful, according to their rank, for the happiness of their lives.\r\nThe care which is bestowed upon the animals who do not recognise Him\r\nis in unison with that more tender kindness which he has manifested\r\nto such as have a mind to meditate on his perfections, and a heart\r\nwherewith to love him and adore.\r\n\r\nThe whalebone is a substance of a horny appearance and consistence,\r\nextremely flexible and elastic, generally of a bluish black colour,\r\nbut not unfrequently striped longitudinally white, and exhibiting\r\na beautiful play of colour on the surface. Internally, it is of a\r\nfibrous texture, resembling hair, and the external surface consists\r\nof a smooth enamel, capable of receiving a good polish. When taken\r\nfrom the whale, the whalebone consists of laminæ, connected by what\r\nis called the gum in a parallel series, and ranged along each side\r\nof the mouth of the animal. The laminæ are about three hundred in\r\nnumber, in each side of the head. The length of the longest blade,\r\nwhich occurs near the middle of the series, is the criterion fixed\r\non by the fishers for designating the size of the fish. Its greatest\r\nlength is about fifteen feet. The two sides or series of the\r\nwhalebone are connected at the upper part of the head or crown-bone\r\nof the fish, within a few inches of each other, from whence they\r\nhang downwards, diverging so far as to inclose the tongue between\r\ntheir extremities; the position of the blades with regard to each\r\nother resembles a frame of saws in a saw-mill; and, taken altogether,\r\nthey exhibit in some measure the form and position of the roof of\r\na house. The smaller extremity and interior edge of each blade of\r\nwhalebone, or the edge annexed to the tongue, are covered with a long\r\nfringe of hair, consisting of a similar kind of substance to that\r\nwhich constitutes the interior of the bone. Whale-bone is generally\r\nbrought from Greenland in the same state as when taken from the fish,\r\nafter being divided into pieces, comprising ten or twelve laminæ in\r\neach. Of late years, the price has usually been fluctuating between\r\n£50 and £150 per ton. It becomes more valuable as it increases in\r\nlength and thickness.\r\n\r\nIn cleansing and preparing the whalebone, the first operation, if\r\nnot already done, consists of depriving it of the gum. It is then\r\nput into a cistern containing water, till the dirt upon its surface\r\nbecomes soft. When this effect is sufficiently produced, it is taken\r\nout piece by piece, laid on a plank placed on the ground, where the\r\noperator stands, and scrubbed or scoured with sand and water, by\r\nmeans of a broom or piece of cloth. It is then passed to another\r\nperson, who, on a plank or bench, elevated to a convenient height,\r\nscrapes the root-end, where the gum was attached, until he produces\r\na smooth surface; he, or another workman, then applies a knife or a\r\npair of shears to the edge, and completely detaches all the fringe\r\nof hair connected with it. Another person, who is generally the\r\nsuperintendent of the concern, afterwards receives it, washes it in a\r\nvessel of clean water, and removes with a bit of wood the impurities\r\nout of the cavity of the root. Thus cleansed, it is exposed to\r\nthe air and sun, until thoroughly dry, when it is removed into a\r\nwarehouse or other place of safety and shelter.\r\n\r\nBefore it is offered for sale, it is usually scrubbed with brushes\r\nand hair-cloth, by which the surface receives a polish, and all\r\ndirt or dust adhering to it removed; and, finally, it is packed in\r\nportable bundles, consisting of about one hundred weight each. The\r\nsize-bone, or such pieces as measure six feet or upwards in length,\r\nare kept separate from the under size, the latter being usually sold\r\nat half the price of the former. Each blade being terminated with a\r\nquantity of hair, there is sometimes a difficulty in deciding whether\r\nsome blades of whalebone are size or not. Owing to the diminished\r\nvalue of under-sized bones, and more particularly in consequence of\r\nthe captain and some of the officers engaged in a fishing-ship having\r\na premium on every size fish, it becomes a matter of some importance\r\nin a doubtful case to decide this point. From a decision which, I\r\nunderstand, has been made in a court of law, it is now a generally\r\nreceived rule, that so much of the substance terminating each blade\r\nas gives rise to two or more hairs is whalebone; though in fact the\r\nhair itself is actually the same substance as that of which the\r\nwhalebone is composed.\r\n\r\nThe oil produced from the blubber of the whale, in its most common\r\nstate of preparation, is used for a variety of purposes. It is used\r\nin the lighting of the streets of towns, and the interior of places\r\nof worship, houses, shops, manufactories, etc.; it is extensively\r\nemployed in the manufacture of soft soap, as well as in the\r\npreparing of leather and coarse woollen cloths; it is applicable in\r\nthe manufacture of coarse varnishes and paints, in which, when duly\r\nprepared, it affords a strength of body more capable of resisting\r\nthe weather than paint mixed in the usual way with vegetable oil; it\r\nis also extensively used for reducing friction in various kinds of\r\nmachinery; combined with tar, it is much employed in ship-work, and\r\nin the manufacture of cordage, and either simple, or in a state of\r\ncombination, it is applied to many other useful purposes.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive applications of whale-oil, that for\r\nillumination, has suffered a considerable diminution, in consequence\r\nof the appropriation of gas from coal to the same purpose. This\r\ndiscovery, brilliant as it is acknowledged to be, which in its\r\nfirst application bore such a threatening aspect against the usual\r\nconsumption of oil, may be the means of bringing the oil of the\r\nwhale into more extensive use than it has at any former period\r\nbeen. Whale-oil, in the most inferior qualities, is found to afford\r\na gas which, in point of brilliancy, freeness of smell, and ease\r\nof manufacture, is greatly superior to that produced from coal. In\r\nplaces where coal is not very cheap, gas, it seems, can be produced\r\nfrom oil at about the same expense as coal-gas; consequently, the\r\nnumerous advantages of the former will render it highly preferable.\r\nWhale-oil, when free from the incombustible and contaminating\r\nanimal matters which are usually dissolved in it in consequence of\r\nputrefaction, is, then, applicable to a variety of purposes, in which\r\nthe common oil cannot conveniently be employed. Even in its unrefined\r\nstate, whale-oil frequently obtains an unmerited bad character for\r\nburning, when the fault lies in those who have the charge of the\r\nlamps in which it is consumed. Want of proper cleanliness, the use\r\nof wicks of too great diameter, and sometimes in a damp state, are\r\ncommon errors inimical to the obtaining of a good light.\r\n\r\nThe fenks, or ultimate refuse of the blubber of the whale, form an\r\nexcellent manure, especially in soils deficient in animal matter.\r\nFenks might be used, it is probable, in the manufacture of Prussian\r\nblue, and also for the production of ammonia. Footing, which is\r\nthe finer detached fragments of the fenks, not wholly deprived\r\nof oil, may be used as a cheap material in the formation of gas.\r\nWhale’s tail can be converted into glue, and is extensively used in\r\nthe manufacture of this article, especially in Holland. It forms,\r\nas I have already mentioned, chopping-blocks for the fishers. The\r\njawbones, with the skull or crown-bone of the whale, are the largest\r\nfound in nature. They are sometimes met with of the length of\r\ntwenty-five feet. Jawbones are used as the ribs of sheds, and in the\r\nconstruction of arches and posts of gateways.\r\n\r\nWhalebone, when softened in hot water, or simply by heating it\r\nbefore a fire, has the property of retaining any shape which may then\r\nbe given to it, provided it be secured in the required form until\r\nit becomes cold. This property, together with its great elasticity\r\nand flexibility, renders it capable of being applied to many useful\r\npurposes. The first way in which it seems to have been employed was\r\nin the stays of ladies. Its application to this purpose was at one\r\nperiod, when the quantity imported was small, so general that it\r\nattained, in the wholesale way, the price of £700 per ton. Of late\r\nyears, however, it has fallen somewhat into disrepute, some ladies\r\npreferring to support themselves with plates of steel. There has\r\nbeen for many years an extensive consumption of this article in the\r\nmanufacture of umbrellas and parasols. The white enamel (found in\r\nsome specimens of whalebone) has been fabricated into ladies’ hats,\r\nand a variety of ornamental forms of head-dresses; and the black\r\nenamel is employed, in the same way as cane, in the construction\r\nof the seats or backs of chairs, gigs, sofas, etc. The hair on\r\nthe edge of the whalebone answers every purpose of bullock’s hair\r\nin stuffings for chairs, sofas, settees, carriages, mattresses,\r\ncushions, etc. An attempt has been made to build whale-boats of\r\nthis material, but the great alteration which takes place in its\r\ndimensions, in different states of the atmosphere, on account of its\r\nready absorption of moisture, renders it inapplicable. It has been\r\nused with a much better effect, in the construction of portmanteaus,\r\ntravelling-trunks, hygrometers, the ram-rods of fowling-pieces,\r\nfishing-rods, the shafts, springs, and wheels of carriages, and\r\nvarious other articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n NARRATIVE OF PROCEEDINGS ON BOARD THE SHIP ESK, DURING A\r\n WHALE-FISHING VOYAGE TO THE COAST OF SPITZBERGEN, IN THE YEAR\r\n 1816; PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE SHIP UNDER\r\n CIRCUMSTANCES OF PECULIAR DANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship Esk sailed from Whitby on the 29th of March, 1816. We\r\nentered the frigid confines of the Icy Sea, and killed our first\r\nwhale on the 25th of April. On the 30th of April, we forced into\r\nthe ice with a favourable wind, and after passing through a large\r\nbody of it, entered an extensive sea, such as usually lies on the\r\nwestern coast of Spitzbergen at this season of the year, early on\r\nthe morning of the following day. The wind then blowing hard south\r\nsouth-east, we kept our reach to the eastward until three o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon, when we unexpectedly met with a quantity of ice, which\r\ninterrupted our course. We then _wared_ by the way of avoiding it,\r\nbut soon found, though the weather was thick with snow, that we were\r\ncompletely embayed in a situation that was truly terrific.\r\n\r\nIn the course of fourteen voyages, in which I had before visited this\r\ninhospitable country, I passed through many dangers wherein my own\r\nlife, together with those of my companions, had been threatened; but\r\nthe present case, where our lives seemed to be at stake for a length\r\nof time, exceeding twelve hours, far surpassed in awfulness, as well\r\nas actual hazard, anything that I had before witnessed. Dangers which\r\noccur unexpectedly and terminate suddenly, though of the most awful\r\ndescription, appear like a dream when they are past; but horrors\r\nwhich have a long continuance, though they in some measure decrease\r\nin their effect on the mind by a lengthened contemplation of them,\r\nyet they leave an impression on the memory which time itself cannot\r\naltogether efface. Such was the effect of the present scene. Whilst\r\nthe wind howled through the rigging with tempestuous roar, the sea\r\nwas so mountainous that the mast-heads of some accompanying ships,\r\nwithin the distance of a quarter of a mile, were intercepted and\r\nrendered invisible by the swells, and our ship frequently rolled the\r\nlee-boats into the water, that were suspended with their keels above\r\nthe roughtree-rail!\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we were rapidly approaching a body of ice, the\r\nmasses of which, as hard as rocks, might be seen at one instant\r\ncovered with foam, the next concealed from the sight by the waves,\r\nand instantly afterwards reared to a prodigious height above the\r\nsurface of the sea. It is needless to relate the means by which\r\nwe attempted to keep the ship clear of the threatened danger,\r\nbecause those means were without avail. At eleven P.M. we were close\r\nto the ice, when perceiving through the mist an opening a short\r\ndistance within, we directed the drift of the ship towards it. As we\r\napproached the ice, the sails were filled, so that the first blow\r\nwas received obliquely on the bow, when the velocity of the ship was\r\nmoderate. In this place the pieces of ice were happily of smaller\r\ndimensions; at least, all the larger masses we were able to avoid,\r\nso that, after receiving a number of shocks, we escaped without any\r\nparticular accident into the opening or slack part of the ice above\r\nnoticed. This opening, as far as we could see, promised a safe and\r\npermanent release.\r\n\r\nBut in this we were grievously disappointed: for, when we attempted\r\nto ware the ship, which soon became necessary, she refused to turn\r\nround, notwithstanding every effort, in a space which, in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, would have been far more than sufficient for the\r\nevolution. In consequence of this accident, which arose partly from\r\nthe bad _trim_ of the ship, and partly from the great violence of\r\nthe wind, she fell to leeward into a close body of ice, to which we\r\ncould see no termination. The Mars, of Whitby, and another vessel,\r\nwhich closely followed us as we penetrated the exterior of the ice,\r\nbeing in better trim than the Esk, performed the evolution with\r\nease, and were in a few minutes out of sight. In this dreadful\r\nsituation, we lay beating against the opposing ice, with terrible\r\nforce, daring eight successive hours, all which time I was rocked\r\nat the top-gallant mast-head, directing the management of the\r\nsails, to avoid the largest masses of ice, any one of which would\r\nhave perforated the side of the ship. By the blessing of God, we\r\nsucceeded wonderfully; and at eight A.M., the 2nd of May, gained a\r\nsmall opening, where we contrived to navigate the ship until the\r\nwind subsided, and we had the opportunity of forcing into a more\r\ncommodious place. On examining the ship, we found our only apparent\r\ndamage to consist in the destruction of most of our rudder works, a\r\nfew slight bruises on the sides, and a cut on the lower part of the\r\nstern of the ship.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, to the 20th of May, the fishery was generally\r\ninterrupted by the formation of new ice, insomuch that during this\r\ninterval we killed but one whale, while few of our neighbours\r\nsucceeded so well. During the succeeding week, we became so fixed\r\nthat we never moved except occasionally a few yards. The next twelve\r\ndays were spent in most arduous labour in forcing the ship through\r\nthe ice. At length, on the 12th of June, we happily escaped, though\r\nour companions were, for a short time, all left behind. On the 27th\r\nof June, we had secured thirteen fish, and our quantity of oil was\r\nabout 125 tuns. This was a larger cargo than any ship had procured\r\nthat we had yet met with, excepting only one. On the 28th, the John,\r\nof Greenock, commanded by my brother-in-law, Mr. Jackson, joined us.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding to the westward, the greater part of the 28th, we\r\narrived at the borders of a compact body of field-ice, consisting of\r\nimmense sheets of prodigious thickness. As I considered the situation\r\nnot favourable for fishing, the ship was allowed to drift to the\r\neastward all night. In the morning of the 29th, I found, however,\r\nthat she was very little removed from the place where she lay when\r\nI went to bed. I perceived that the floes, between which there had\r\nbeen extensive spaces, were now in the act of closing; and attempted,\r\nby lowering four boats, to tow the ship through an opening at a\r\nshort distance from us. At the moment when we were about to enter\r\nit, it closed. In attempting to get the ship into the safety of an\r\nindentation, which appeared calculated to afford a secure retreat, a\r\nsmall piece of ice came athwart her bow, stopped her progress, and\r\nshe was in a minute afterwards subjected to a considerable squeeze.\r\nFrom none, however, of the pieces of ice around us did we apprehend\r\nany danger, particularly as the motion of the ice soon abated. There\r\nwas a danger, however, on the larboard quarter, of which we were\r\ntotally unconscious. The piece of ice that touched the ship in that\r\npart, though of itself scarcely six yards square, and more than one\r\nyard above the water, concealed beneath the surface of the sea,\r\nat the depth of ten or twelve feet, a hard pointed projection of\r\nice, which pressed against the keel, lifted the rudder, and caused\r\na damage that had nearly occasioned the loss of the ship. About an\r\nhour and a half after the accident, the carpenter, having sounded\r\nthe pump, discovered to our great concern and amazement a depth of\r\neight and a half feet water in the hold. This was most alarming;\r\nwith despair pictured in every face, the crew set on the pumps; a\r\nsignal of distress was at the same time hoisted, and a dozen boats\r\napproached us from the surrounding ships. In the space of four hours,\r\nthe water had lowered to nearly four feet, but one of the pumps\r\nbecoming useless, and bailing being less effectual than at first, the\r\nwater once more resumed its superiority and gained upon us.\r\n\r\nSomething, therefore, was now to be done, to stop, if possible, the\r\ninflux of the water. As the pumping and bailing could not possibly\r\nbe continued by our own ship’s company, it was necessary to make use\r\nof some means to attempt a speedy remedy whilst our assistants were\r\nnumerous. As there was a probability that a bunch of rope-yarns,\r\nstraw, or oakum, might enter some of the larger leaks, and retard\r\nthe influx of water, if applied near the place through the medium\r\nof a fothering-sail, (that is, a sail drawn by means of ropes at\r\nthe four corners, beneath the damaged or leaky part,) we in the\r\nmeantime prepared a lower studding-sail, by sewing bunches of\r\nthese materials, which, together with sheets of old thin canvas,\r\nwhalebone-hair, and a quantity of ashes, fitted it well for the\r\npurpose. Thus prepared, it was hauled beneath the damaged place, but\r\nnot the least effect was yet produced. We set about unrigging the\r\nship, and discharging the cargo and stores, upon a flat place of the\r\nfloe, against which we had moored, with the intention of turning the\r\nship keel upward. My own sailors were completely worn out, and most\r\nof our auxiliaries wearied and discouraged; some of them evinced, by\r\ntheir improper conduct, their wish that the ship should be abandoned.\r\nBefore putting our plan in execution, we placed twenty empty casks\r\nin the hold, to act against a quantity of iron ballast which was in\r\nthe ship, caulked the dark lights, removed all the dry goods and\r\nprovisions that would injure with the wet, secured all the hatches,\r\nskuttles, companion, etc., then, erecting two tents on the ice,\r\none for sheltering myself, and the other for the crew, we ceased\r\npumping, and permitted the ship to fill. At this crisis, men of whom\r\nI had conceived the highest opinion for firmness and bravery greatly\r\ndisappointed my expectations. Among the whole crew, indeed, scarcely\r\na dozen spirited fellows were to be seen.\r\n\r\nAs no ship could with propriety venture near us, to assist in turning\r\nthe Esk over, on account of the hazardous position of the ice around\r\nher, we had no other means of attempting this singular evolution\r\nthan by attaching purchases to the ice from the ship. Everything\r\nbeing prepared, while the water flowed into the ship, I sent our\r\nexhausted crew to seek a little rest. For my own part, necessity\r\nimpelled me to endeavour to obtain some repose. I had already been\r\nfifty hours without rest, which unusual exertion, together with the\r\nanxiety of mind I endured, caused my legs to swell and become so\r\nextremely painful, that I could scarcely walk. Spreading, therefore,\r\na mattress upon a few boards, laid on the snow within one of the\r\ntents, notwithstanding the coldness of the situation, and the\r\nexcessive dampness that prevailed from the constant fog, I enjoyed a\r\ncomfortable repose of four hours, and arose considerably refreshed.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards, about three P.M., on the 1st of July, I\r\nproceeded with all hands to the ship, which, to our surprise, we\r\nfound had only sunk a little below the sixteenth mark externally,\r\nwhile the water but barely covered a part of “’tween decks within.”\r\nPerceiving that it was not likely to sink much further, on account of\r\nthe buoyancy of the empty casks, and the materials of which the ship\r\nwas composed, we applied all our purchases, but with the strength of\r\n150 men we could not heel her more than five or six stakes. When thus\r\ncareened, with the weight of two anchors suspended from the mast,\r\nacting with the effect of powerful levers on the ship, I accompanied\r\nabout 120 men on board. All these being arranged on the high side\r\nof the deck, ran suddenly to the lower side, when the ship fell so\r\nsuddenly on one side that we were apprehensive she was about to\r\nupset, but after turning a little way the motion ceased. The tackles\r\non the ice being then hauled tight, the heeling position of the ship\r\nwas preserved, until we mounted the higher part of the deck, and\r\nran to the lower as before. At length, after a few repetitions of\r\nthis manœuvre, no impression whatever was produced, and the plan of\r\nupsetting the ship appeared quite impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the ship being now desperate, there could be no\r\nimpropriety in attempting to remove the keel and garboard strake,\r\nwhich prevented the application of the fothering, for, whatever might\r\nbe the result, it could scarcely be for the worse. These incumbrances\r\nbeing removed, the sail for fothering was immediately applied to\r\nthe place, and a vast quantity of fothering materials thrown into\r\nits cavity, when it was fairly underneath. Over this sail we spread\r\na fore-sail, and braced the whole as tight to the ship as the\r\nkeel-bolts, which yet remained in their horizontal position, would\r\nadmit. The effect was as happy as we could possibly have anticipated.\r\nSome time before all these preparations were completed, our people,\r\nassisted by the John’s crew, who, after a short rest, had returned to\r\nus, put the three pumps and bailing tubs in motion, and applied their\r\nenergies with such effect that in eleven hours the pumps sucked! In\r\nthis time, a depth of thirteen feet water was pumped out of the\r\nhold, besides the leakage. The John’s crew on this occasion exerted\r\nthemselves with a spirit and zeal which were truly praiseworthy.\r\nAs the assistance of carpenters was particularly needed, we fired\r\na gun, and repeated our signal of distress, which brought very\r\nopportunely two boats, with six men each, from the Prescot, and the\r\nsame number from our tried friend, Mr. Allen, of the North Britain.\r\nAs we likewise procured the carpenters of these ships, together with\r\nthose of the John, they commenced operations by cutting through the\r\nceiling, between two frames of timbers directly across the hold,\r\nat the distance of about twenty-six feet from the stern-post; a\r\nsituation which, we were assured, was on the fore part of the leak,\r\nor between the leak and the body of the ship. The timbers in this\r\nplace were unhappily found so closely connected that we had to cut\r\naway part of one of the floors, that we might come at the outside\r\nplank, and caulk the crevices between it and the timbers; which\r\noperation, on account of the great depth of timber, and the vast\r\nflow of water that issued at the ceiling, was extremely difficult,\r\ntedious, and disagreeable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile that we had good assistance, I allowed our crew four hours’\r\nrest, half of them at a time, for which purpose some of their beds\r\nwere removed from the ice to the ship. Here, for the first time\r\nduring four days, they enjoyed their repose; for on account of the\r\ncold and damp that prevailed when they rested on the ice, several of\r\nthem, I believe, never slept. Some of the John’s people returning to\r\nus, swayed up the top-mast, and rigged most of the yards, while our\r\nmen were employed stowing the main-hold, which, by the floating of\r\nthe casks, was thrown into a singular state of disorder. Some of the\r\ncasks were found without heads, and all the blubber lost, and many\r\nwere found bilged, or otherwise damaged.\r\n\r\nAfter the carpenters had completely cleared the roomstead—that is,\r\nthe space between any two ribs or frames of timbers in a ship—they\r\ndrove oakum into it, along with an improved woollen sheathing\r\nsubstance; and occasionally, where the spaces were very large, pieces\r\nof fat pork. The spaces or crevices between the planks of the ceiling\r\nand the timber being then filled, all the above substances were\r\nfirmly driven down by means of pine wedges, and the spaces between\r\neach of the wedges caulked. This would have been very complete, had\r\nnot the increased flow of the water overcome the pumps, and covered\r\nthe ceiling where the carpenters were at work. They were therefore\r\nobliged to wedge up the place with great expedition; and being at\r\nthe same time greatly fatigued, the latter part of the operation was\r\naccomplished with much less perfection than I could have wished.\r\n\r\nHitherto calm weather, with thick fog, having constantly prevailed,\r\nwas the occasion of several ships remaining by us and affording\r\nassistance, which would otherwise have left us. But the weather\r\nhaving now become clear, and a prospect of prosecuting the fishery\r\nbeing presented, every ship deserted us, except the John, and she\r\nwas preparing to leave us likewise. In the state of extreme jeopardy\r\nin which we were still placed, the love of life, on the part of the\r\ncrew, determined them to attempt to quit the ship, and take refuge in\r\nthe John as soon as she should attempt to leave us. I was confident,\r\nthrough the information I had received, that unless the assistance of\r\nthe John were secured, the Esk, after all the labour bestowed on her,\r\nand the progress which had been made towards her preservation, must\r\nyet be abandoned as a wreck. At length, I yielded to the request of\r\nmy whole crew, and made a proposal to captain Jackson, who agreed on\r\ncertain conditions, involving the surrender of a large proportion of\r\nour cargo, to stay by us and assist us until our arrival at some port\r\nof Shetland. The original of this contract was voluntarily signed by\r\nevery individual of both ships’ companies. A subsequent agreement of\r\na more explicit kind, on the part of masters and owners of the Esk\r\nand the John, was drawn out and signed by myself and Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\nThese agreements being fully understood and signed, the John hauled\r\nalongside of the ice, which had now opened near the Esk for the first\r\ntime since the accident, and took on board the whole of our loose\r\nblubber, estimated at seventy-eight butts and fifty-eight butts,\r\nin twenty-five casks, together with half our whalebone, as agreed.\r\nEverything now went on favourably, and whilst our crew and assistants\r\nwere in full and vigorous employment, I retired to seek that repose\r\nwhich my wearied frame stood greatly in need of. On the 5th July,\r\nassisted by all hands from the John, the stowing of the hold and\r\nthe rigging of the ship were completed, and, under a moderate\r\nbreeze of wind, we left the floe, but what was our astonishment and\r\nmortification to find that the ship could not be guided! The rudder\r\nhad become perfectly useless, so that with the most appropriate\r\ndisposition of the sails possible, and the requisite position of the\r\nhelm, the ship could not be turned round, or diverted in the least\r\nfrom the course in which the impetus of the wind on the sails was\r\nthe most naturally balanced. This was an alarming disappointment.\r\nHowever, as the ship was in such constant danger of being crushed\r\nin the situation where she lay, the John, with the greatest\r\ndifficulty imaginable, towed us three or four miles to the eastward,\r\ninto a place of comparative safety. Here we rectified our rudder,\r\nand arranged for the trimming of the ship more by the stern, to\r\ncompensate in some degree for the loss of the after-keel. When these\r\nmatters were completed, on account of strong wind and thick weather,\r\nwe could not, without imminent danger, attempt to penetrate the\r\ncompact body of ice which at this time barred our escape to the sea,\r\nand I took the advantage of the opportunity to procure a long rest.\r\nThe attention of the carpenters in caulking the ceiling of the ship,\r\ntogether with the advantage derived from the fothering sails, had now\r\nproduced an effect so considerable, that on Sunday, the 7th of July,\r\nthe original leakage was found to be reduced nearly four-fifths.\r\nDuring an hour, in which we were engaged in Divine service, the pumps\r\nwere allowed to “stand;” two and a half feet of water, which in this\r\ninterval flowed into the hold, was pumped out in twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter various alarms and careful attention to the leakage, together\r\nwith the unremitting diligence of the crew in the use of the pumps,\r\nwe descried land on the 23rd of July, and approached within three\r\nor four miles of the coast of Shetland. In the evening, the John\r\nhaving fulfilled the articles of agreement as far as was required,\r\nwe sent the twelve men belonging to her crew on board, and after\r\nreceiving from them a supply of fresh water, they left us with three\r\ncheers, and the usual display of colours. We were now left to sail by\r\nourselves; our progress was in consequence rather slow. At daylight\r\nof the 27th, we were rejoiced with a sight of our port. Knowing\r\nthe flow of water to be sufficient for the ship, and there being a\r\nprobability of reaching the harbour before the tide was too much\r\nfallen, we pressed towards it with every sail we could set, and\r\nhaving received a pilot as we approached the pier, we immediately\r\nentered the harbour, and grounded at half-past five A.M. in a place\r\nof safety.\r\n\r\nThus, through the peculiar favour of God, by whose influence our\r\nperseverance was stimulated, and by whose blessing our contrivances\r\nwere rendered effectual, happily terminated a voyage at once\r\nhazardous, disastrous, and interesting. Men whose lives have\r\nbeen exposed to dangers so fearful and imminent, may reasonably\r\nbe expected to be influenced by a vivid sense of the nearness of\r\neternity, and to feel the powers of the world to come. It is the\r\nprerogative of the Christian religion, whilst it prepares men for\r\ndeath, to take away undue apprehensions of it; to furnish consolation\r\nof unspeakable value, when it is present; and to light up the distant\r\nand unknown future, with the peace and happiness of the hope of\r\neternal life. To the rude and courageous mariner, as well as to the\r\ninhabitants of refined and luxurious homes, God’s message is one\r\nand the same. It is suitable, and worthy of acceptation, on sea and\r\non land, in sickness and in health, when we expect instant removal\r\nfrom our present temporary dwelling-place, or look forward to the\r\nactivities and cares of a protracted life. To every one of us the\r\nAlmighty is saying, Repent, believe, and live—promising a free and\r\ncomplete pardon through the death of his Son, and engaging, to those\r\nwho welcome and obey his message, that they shall live under the\r\nsmile of His countenance and the protection of his power.\r\n\r\nIntelligence relative to the distressed state of the ship, and the\r\nhelplessness of her situation, reached Whitby the day before us, and,\r\nin consequence of exaggerations respecting the loss of the crew,\r\ninvolved every interested person in deep distress. Throughout the\r\ntown, and in a great measure throughout the neighbourhood, the event\r\nwas considered as a general calamity. Some of the underwriters on the\r\nEsk, I was informed, had offered sixty per cent. for the reassurance\r\nof the sums for which they were liable, but such was the nature\r\nof the risk, as ascertained from the information of some ships’\r\ncrews, by whom we had been assisted, that no one would undertake\r\nthe assurance, even at this extraordinary premium. The hearty\r\ncongratulations I received on landing, from every acquaintance, were\r\nalmost overwhelming, and these, with the enhanced endearments of my\r\naffectionate and enraptured wife, amply repaid for all the toils and\r\nanxieties of mind that I had endured.\r\n\r\nOn the tide ebbing out, the Esk was left dry, on which, for the first\r\ntime since the accident, the whole of the water was drawn out of the\r\nhold by the pumps. The next tide, the ship was removed above the\r\nbridge to a place of perfect safety, where the pumps being neglected,\r\nthe water in the course of two tides rose nearly as high within as\r\nwithout. After the cargo was discharged, the ship was put into dock,\r\nand it was found that, excepting the loss of twenty-two feet of\r\nkeel, and the removal of a piece of the starboard garboard strake,\r\nnine feet in length, with a portion of dead-wood brought home upon\r\ndeck, no other damage of consequence had been produced by the ice.\r\nThe whole expense of repairs did not, I believe, exceed £200. Though\r\nthe sacrifice of nearly one-half of our cargo was a considerable\r\ndisappointment to the owners, who had been apprized of our success in\r\nfishery, yet, when compared with the salvage, which might have been\r\ndemanded had no contract been entered into for the assistance of the\r\nJohn, the sacrifice appeared to have been a material benefit, having\r\nbeen productive of the saving of perhaps £2,000. The approbation\r\nof my conduct by the owners, Messrs. Fishburn and Brodrick, was\r\ntestified by their presenting to me a gratuity of £50; and the sense\r\nentertained by the Whitby underwriters, of the preservation of the\r\nship, was pleasingly manifested by a present of a handsome piece of\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nI may add, in conclusion, that the whole of my crew, excepting one\r\nindividual, returned from this adventurous and trying voyage in\r\nsafety, and in general in a good state of health. Several of the\r\nmen, indeed, were affected more or less by the excessive fatigue,\r\nand by the painful exposure to cold and damp, while resting on the\r\nice; but all of them were, in a great measure, restored before our\r\narrival at home, excepting one man; he, poor fellow, being of a weak\r\nconstitution, suffered severely from the inclement exposure, and died\r\nsoon after he arrived in port.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS TRACT SOCIETY: INSTITUTED 1799.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n  pg 26 Changed period after: this, in 1749 to: comma\r\n  pg 27 Changed equipped from Embden to: Emden\r\n  pg 47 Changed misspelling of \"sails becomes neccessary\" to: necessary\r\n  pg 64 Removed repeated word it from: It it bears this\r\n  pg 74 Added period to the end of: moment of danger\r\n  pg 75 Changed comma to period at: requiring extreme dispatch\r\n  pg 78 Changed rate of 816 to: 8·16 and 718 to: 7·18\r\n  pg 80 Added period to: 3,104,640 lbs\r\n  pg 115 Changed to provent them to: prevent\r\n  pg 165 Added period to: not been felt\r\n  pg 185 Changed swayed up the topmast to: top-mast\r\n  Various hyphenated and non-hyphenated words left as written",
