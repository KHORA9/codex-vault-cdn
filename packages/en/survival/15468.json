Coal is one of our greatest blessings, and\r\ncertainly one originating cause of England's greatness and wealth. It\r\nhas given us a power over other nations, and vast sums of money are\r\nyearly brought to our country from abroad in exchange for the coal we\r\nsend. Nearly £17,000,000 is the representative value of the coal raised\r\nevery year at the pit's mouth, and £20,000,000 represent its mean value\r\nat the various places of consumption. The capital invested in our\r\ncoal-mining trade, apart from the value of the mines themselves,\r\nexceeds £20,000,000 sterling, and the amount of coal annually extracted\r\nfrom the earth is over 70,000,000 of tons. Taking the calculation of a\r\nworking miner--J. Ellwood, Moss Pit, near Whitehaven--we may state, that\r\nif 68,000,000 tons were excavated from a mining gallery 6 feet high and\r\n12 feet wide, that gallery would be not less than 5128 miles, 1090\r\nyards, in length; or, if this amount of coal were erected in a pyramid,\r\nits square base would extend over 40 acres, and the height would be 3356\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThere are grounds for believing that the produce of the various\r\ncoal-fields of the world does not at present much exceed 100,000,000 of\r\ntons annually, and therefore our own country contributes more than\r\nthree-fifths of the total amount. If we divide the coal-yielding\r\ncounties of Britain into four classes, so as to make nearly equal\r\namounts of produce, we find that Durham and Northumberland yield rather\r\nmore every year than seven other counties, including Yorkshire.\r\nDerbyshire, again, produces more than eight other counties, and nearly\r\nas much as the whole of North and South Wales, Scotland, and\r\nIreland--the yield of the latter being about 17,000,000 of tons, and\r\nthat of the two first-named about 16,000,000 of tons.\r\n\r\nIn 1773 there were only 13 collieries on the Tyne, and these had\r\nincreased to upwards of 30 in 1800. The number of collieries in 1828 had\r\nincreased to 41 on the Tyne, and 18 on the Wear, in all 59, producing\r\n5,887,552 tons of coal. The out-put of coal in Northumberland and Durham\r\nin 1854 was no less than 15,420,615 tons, and now in these two counties\r\nthere are 283 collieries. Mining began on the Tyne and continued on the\r\nWear, where the industry has been largely developed. There are in all\r\nabout 57 different seams in the Great Northern coal-field, varying in\r\nthickness from 1 inch to 5 feet 5 inches and 6 feet, and these seams\r\ncomprise an aggregate of nearly 76 feet of coal. Taking the area of this\r\nfield to be 750 square miles--a most probable estimate--we may classify\r\nthe contents as household coal, steam coal, or those employed in\r\nsteam-engine boilers, and coking coal, employed for making coke and gas.\r\nOf household coal there is only 96 square miles out of the total 750,\r\nall the remainder being steam or coking and gas coal. The greater part\r\neven of this 96 square miles has been worked out on the Tyne, and the\r\nsupply is rapidly decreasing also on the Wear, where the largest bulk\r\nof the household coal lies. The collieries of the Tees possess but six\r\nsquare miles out of the 96, as far as we at present know. Turning,\r\nhowever, to that part of the coal-field regarded as precarious, and\r\nconsisting of first, second, and third-rate household coal, we have for\r\nfuture use 300 square miles. London was formerly supplied from the pits\r\neast of Tyne Bridge, where is the famous Wallsend Colliery, which gave\r\nthe name to the best coal. That mine is now drowned out, and, like the\r\ngreat Roman Wall, at the termination of which it was sunk, and from\r\nwhich it derived its name, is now an antiquity. There is now no Wallsend\r\ncoal, and the principal part of the present so-called coal comes from\r\nthe Wear, but the seam which supplied that famous pit is continued into\r\nDurham, and that seam, or its equivalent, sends a million or two of tons\r\nevery year into London. The supply, however, in this district is rapidly\r\ndecreasing. Careful calculations have been made as to the probable\r\nduration of this coal, of which the following is a summary. The workable\r\nquantity of coal remaining in the ten principal seams of this coal-field\r\nis estimated at 1,876,848,756 Newcastle chaldrons (each 35 cwt.).\r\nDeducting losses and underground and surface waste, the total\r\nmerchantable round or good-sized coal will be 1,251,232,507 Newcastle\r\nchaldrons. Proceeding on this estimate, formed by Mr. Grunwith in 1846,\r\nwe may arrive at the probable duration of the supplies: taking the\r\nfuture annual average of coal raised from these seams to be 10,000,000\r\nof tons--and this is under the present rate--the whole will be exhausted\r\nin 331 years. A still later estimate was made by Mr. T.G. Hall in 1854,\r\nand he reckoned the quantity of coal left for future use at\r\n5,121,888,956 tons; dividing this by 14,000,000 of tons as the annual\r\nconsumption, the result would be 365 years; and should the annual demand\r\narrive at 20,000,000 of tons, the future supply of this famous\r\ncoal-field would continue for 256 years. The total available coal (1871)\r\nin the British coal-fields, at depths not exceeding 4000 feet, and in\r\nseams not less than 1 foot thick, is 90,207,285,398 tons, and taking\r\ninto account seams which may yet become available, lying under the\r\nPermian, New Red Sandstone, and other superincumbent strata, this\r\nestimate is increased to 146,480,000,000 of tons. This quantity, at the\r\npresent annual rate of production throughout the country--namely,\r\n123,500,000 tons--would last 1186 years. Other estimates of various\r\nkinds relative to our coal supply have been put forth: some have\r\nasserted that, owing to increasing population and increasing consumption\r\nin manufactures, it will be exhausted in 100 years, and between this\r\nextreme and that of 1186 years there are many other conjectures and\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there are about 120,000 square miles underlaid by\r\nknown workable coal-beds, besides what yet remains to be discovered;\r\nwhile on the cliffs of Nova Scotia the coal-seams can be seen one over\r\nthe other for many hundred feet, and showing how the coal was originally\r\nformed. With this immense stock of fuel in the cellars of the earth, it\r\nseems evident that we need not trouble our minds or be anxious as to the\r\nduration of our coal supply. Besides, the conversion of vegetable matter\r\ninto coal seems to be going on even now. In the United States there are\r\npeat-bogs of considerable extent, in which a substance exactly\r\nresembling cannel coal has been found; and in some of the Irish\r\npeat-beds, as also in the North of Scotland, a similar substance has\r\nbeen discovered, of a very inflammable nature, resembling coal.\r\n\r\nYes! what could have produced this singular-looking, black, inflammable\r\nrock? How many times was this question asked before Science could return\r\nan answer? This she can now do with confidence. Coal was once growing\r\nvegetable matter. On the surface of the shale, immediately above the\r\ncoal, you will find innumerable impressions of leaves and branches, as\r\nperfect as artist ever drew. But how could this vegetable matter ever\r\naccumulate in such masses as to make beds of coal of such vast extent,\r\nsome not less than 30 feet thick? It would take 10 or 12 feet of green\r\nvegetable matter to make 1 foot of solid coal. Let us transport\r\nourselves to the carboniferous times, and see the condition of the\r\nearth, and this may assist us to answer the question. Stand on this\r\nrocky eminence and behold that sea of verdure, whose gigantic waves roll\r\nin the greenest of billows to the verge of the horizon--that is a\r\ncarboniferous forest. Mark that steamy cloud floating over it, an\r\nindication of the great evaporation constantly proceeding. The scent of\r\nthe morning air is like that of a greenhouse; and well it may be, for\r\nthe land of the globe is a mighty hothouse--the crust of the earth is\r\nstill thin, and its internal heat makes a tropical climate everywhere,\r\nunchecked by winter's cold, thus forcing plants to a most luxurious\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nDescend, and let us wander through this forest and examine it more\r\nclosely. What strange trees are here! No oaks, no elms, or ash, or\r\nchestnut--no trees that we ever saw before. It looks as if the plants of\r\na boggy meadow had shot up in a single night to a height of 60 or 70\r\nfeet, and we were walking among the stalks--a gigantic meadow of ferns,\r\nreeds, grasses, and club-mosses. A million columns rise, so thick at the\r\ntop that they make twilight at mid-day, and their trunks are so close\r\ntogether we can scarcely edge our way between them, whilst the ground is\r\ncarpeted with trailing plants completely interwoven. What strange trees\r\nthey are! Beneath us lies an accumulation of vegetable matter more than\r\n200 feet in thickness--the result of the growth and decay of plants in\r\nthis swamp for centuries. All things are here favourable for the growth\r\nof vegetation--the great heat of the ground causes water to rise rapidly\r\nin vapour, and this again descends in showers, supplying the plants with\r\nmoisture continuously. The air contains a large proportion of carbonic\r\nacid gas, poison to animals but food to plants, which, by means of its\r\naid, build up their woody structure. Winds at times level these gigantic\r\nplants, for their hold on the earth is feeble, and thus the mass goes on\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nWe are now on the edge of a lake abounding with fish, whose bony scales\r\nglitter in the water as they pursue their prey. Lying along the shore\r\nare shells cast up by the waves, and there are also seen the tracks of\r\nsome large animals. How like the impression of a man's hand some of\r\nthese tracks are! The hind-feet are evidently much larger than the\r\nfore-feet. There is the frog-like animal which made them, and what a\r\nsize! It must be six feet long, and its head looks like that of a\r\ncrocodile, for its jaws are furnished with formidable rows of long,\r\nstrong, sharp, conical teeth.\r\n\r\nThe continued growth and decomposition of the vegetation during long\r\nages must have produced beds like the peat-deposits of America and Great\r\nBritain. In the Dismal Swamp of Virginia there is said to be a mass of\r\nvegetable matter 40 feet in thickness, and on the banks of the Shannon\r\nin Ireland is a peat-bog 3 miles broad and 50 feet deep. When conditions\r\nwere so much more favourable for these deposits, beds 400 feet in\r\nthickness may easily have been produced. This accumulated mass of\r\nvegetable matter must be buried, however, before we can have a coal-bed.\r\nHow was this accomplished? The very weight of it may have caused the\r\ncrust of the earth to sink, forming a basin into which rivers, sweeping\r\ndown from the surrounding higher country, and carrying down mud in their\r\nwaters, the weight of which, deposited upon the vegetable matter,\r\npressed and squeezed it into half its original compass. Sand carried\r\ndown subsequently in a similar manner, and deposited upon the mud,\r\npressed it into shale, and the vegetable matter, still more reduced in\r\nvolume by this additional pressure, is prepared for its final conversion\r\ninto shale. In time the basin becomes shallow from the decomposition of\r\nsediment on its bottom, and then we have another marsh with its myriad\r\nplants; another accumulation of vegetable matter takes place, which by\r\nsimilar processes is also buried. Where thirty or forty seams of coal\r\nhave been found one below another, we have evidence of land and water\r\nthus changing places many times.\r\n\r\nWhen vegetable matter is excluded from air and under great pressure, it\r\ndecomposes slowly, parting with carbonic acid gas; and is first changed\r\ninto lignite or brown coal, and then into bituminous coal, or the soft\r\ncoal that burns with smoke and flame. I have been in a coal-mine where\r\nthe carbonic acid gas, pouring from a crevice in the coal, put out a\r\nlighted candle. The high temperature to which the coal has been\r\nsubjected when buried at great depths has also probably assisted in\r\nproducing this change; and where that temperature has been very high,\r\nthe coal by the influence of the heat having parted with its inflammable\r\ngases, we have the hard or anthracite coal, which burns with little or\r\nno flame and without smoke. It is indeed coal made into coke under\r\ntremendous pressure, and this is the kind of coal which Americans use\r\nexclusively in their dwelling-houses and monster hotels.\r\n\r\nIt was at first supposed that the plants of the carboniferous times were\r\nbamboos, palms, and gigantic cactuses, such as are now found in tropical\r\nregions, but a more careful examination of them shows that, with the\r\nexception of the tree-fern now found in the tropics, they differ from\r\nall existing trees. A large proportion of the plants of the\r\ncoal-measures were ferns, some authorities say one-half. From their\r\ngreat abundance we may infer the great heat and moisture of the\r\natmosphere at the time when they grew, as similar ferns at the present\r\nday are only found in the greatest abundance on small tropical islands\r\nwhere the temperature is high. Coal often contains impressions of fern\r\nleaves and palm-like ferns--no less than 934 kinds are drawn and\r\ndescribed by geologists. Many animals and insects are found in the coal,\r\nsuch as large toad-like reptiles with beautiful teeth, small lizards,\r\nwater lizards, great fish with tremendous jaws, many insects of the\r\ngrasshopper tribe, but none of these are of the same species as those\r\nfound now living on this globe.\r\n\r\nWood, peat, brown coal, jet, and true coal, are chemically alike,\r\ndiffering only in their amount of oxygen, due to the difference of\r\ncompression to which they were subjected. The sun gave his heat and\r\nlight to the forests now turned into coal, and when we burn it ages\r\nafterwards, we revive some of the heat and light so long untouched.\r\nStephenson once remarked to Sir Robert Peel, as they stood watching a\r\npassing train: \"There goes _the sunshine of former ages_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF WORKING.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated shortly the origin and extent of the coal of this\r\ncountry, more particularly that of the northern coal-fields of\r\nNorthumberland and Durham, I think it may be interesting to say\r\nsomething of the cost at which this valuable article is obtained, as I\r\nam sure few are at all aware of the vast sums of money that have to be\r\nexpended before we can sit down by our comfortable firesides, with a\r\ncold winter night outside, and read our book, or have our family\r\ngathered round us; and few know the danger and hardship of the bold\r\nworker who risks his life to procure the coal. The first step is to find\r\nout if there is coal. This done, the next is to get at it, or, as it is\r\ntermed, to _win_ the coal. The process is to sink a shaft, and this is\r\nalike dangerous, uncertain, and very costly. The first attempt to sink a\r\npit at Haswell in Durham was abandoned after an outlay of £60,000. The\r\nsinkers had to pass through sand, under the magnesian limestone, where\r\nvast quantities of water lay stored, and though engines were erected\r\nthat pumped out 26,700 tons of water per day, yet the flood remained the\r\nconqueror. This amount seems incredible, but such is the fact. At\r\nanother colliery near Gateshead (Goose Colliery), 1000 gallons a minute,\r\nor 6000 tons of water per day, were pumped out, and only 300 tons of\r\ncoal were brought up in the same time, and thus the water raised\r\nexceeded the coal twenty times. The most astonishing undertaking in\r\nmining was the Dalton le Dale Pit, nine miles from Durham. On the 1st\r\nJune 1840 they pumped out 3285 gallons a minute. Engines were erected\r\nwhich raised 93,000 gallons a minute from a depth of 90 fathoms or 540\r\nfeet, and this was done night and day. The amount expended to reach the\r\ncoal in this pit was £300,000. Mr. Hall estimates the capital invested\r\nin the coal trade of the counties of Durham and Northumberland,\r\nincluding private railways, waggons, and docks for loading ships, at\r\n£13,000,000 sterling.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty in working coal, should these upper seams fail, is\r\nnot only the increase of cost in sinking further down, but the increased\r\nheat to be worked in. At 2000 feet the mine will increase in heat 28°,\r\nat 4000, 57°; to this must be added the constant temperature of 50° 5',\r\nso that at 2000 feet it would be 78° 5', and at 4000, 107° 5' Fahr. By\r\nactual trial on July 17, 1857, in Duckingfield Pit, the temperature at\r\n2249 feet was 75° 5'. From this it may be conceived in what great heat\r\nthe men have to work, and the work is very hard. One may fancy from this\r\nwhat can be endured, but it would be next to impossible to work in a\r\ngreater temperature. I can speak upon this from actual experience, as\r\nwhen down the Lady Londonderry Pit the temperature was 85°, and here the\r\nmen worked naked. Another great source of expense and anxiety lies in\r\nkeeping up the roof, as, from the excessive pressure, the roof and floor\r\nare always inclined to come together, and props must therefore be used,\r\nand these in some pits cost as much as £1500 a year. To digress for a\r\nmoment, an amusing story is told of Grimaldi, the celebrated clown, when\r\npaying a visit to a coal-pit. Having gone some way through the mine, a\r\nsudden noise, arising from the falling of coal from the roof, caused him\r\nto ask the reason of the noise. \"Hallo!\" exclaimed Grimaldi, greatly\r\nterrified, \"what's that?\" \"Hech!\" said his guide, \"it's only a wee bit\r\nof coal fallen down--we have that three or four times a day.\" \"Then I'll\r\nthank you to ring for my basket, for I'll stop no longer among the wee\r\nbits of falling coal.\" This \"wee bit\" was about three tons' weight. A\r\nlarge proportion of the sad accidents in coal-mines is caused by these\r\nfalls of the roof, which give no warning, but suddenly come down and\r\ncrush to death those who happen to be near.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF WORKING.\r\n\r\nThe cost of working having thus been given, I wish now to lay before you\r\nan explanation of the method of working and bringing the coal to the\r\nsurface. It may not be uninteresting to mention how many men are\r\nemployed in this work, as the number is very large. Coal was not\r\nformerly excavated by machinery, but it is so now, and therefore hands\r\nmust be had. The number of men employed in the mines of county Durham in\r\n1854 was 28,000; of these, 13,500 were hewers, winning several thousand\r\ntons of coal daily. Of the remainder, 3500 were safety-staff men,\r\nhaving, besides, 1400 boys belonging to their staff; 2000 were off-hand\r\nmen, for bargain work or other duties; 7600 lads and boys, working\r\nunder the various designations of \"putters,\" or pushers of coal-tubs,\r\nunderground \"drivers,\" \"marrows,\" \"half-marrows,\" and \"foals,\" these\r\nlatter terms being local, and significant of age and labour. For\r\nNorthumberland must be added 10,536 persons, and Cumberland 3579, making\r\na total for these three counties of upwards of 42,000 persons labouring\r\nin and round our northern collieries. The average that each hewer will\r\nraise per day is from two to three tons in thin, and three to four tons\r\nin thick seams. The largest quantity raised by any hewer on an average\r\nof the colliers of England is about six tons a day of eight hours. The\r\nmode of working is very laborious, as the majority of seams of coal\r\nbeing very thin--that is to say, not more than two feet thick--the\r\nworker of necessity is obliged to work in a constrained position, often\r\nlying on his side; and you can fancy the labour of using a pick in such\r\na position. To get an idea of the position, just place yourself under a\r\ntable, and then try to use a pick, and it will give you a pretty clear\r\nidea of the comfortable way in which a great part of our coal is got,\r\nand this also at a temperature of 86° in bad air. The object, of\r\ncourse, of the worker is to take nothing but coal, as all labour is lost\r\nthat is spent in taking any other material away. The man after a time\r\ngets twisted in his form, from being constantly in this constrained\r\nposition, and, in fact, to sit upright like other men is at last\r\npainful. Then an amount of danger is always before him, even in the best\r\nregulated and ventilated pits. This danger proceeds from fire-damp, as\r\none unlucky stroke of the pick may bring forth a stream of carbureted\r\nhydrogen gas, inexplosive of itself, but if mixed with eight times its\r\nbulk of air, more dangerous than gunpowder, and which, if by chance it\r\ncomes in contact with the flame of a candle, is sure to explode, and\r\ncertain death is the result--not always from the explosion itself, but\r\nfrom the after-damp or carbonic acid gas which follows it.\r\n\r\nUpwards of 1500 lives are yearly lost from these causes, and not less\r\nthan 10,000 accidents in the same period show the constant danger that\r\nthe miner is exposed to. It would appear that England has more deaths\r\nfrom mining accidents than foreign countries, as Mr. Mackworth's table\r\nwill show:--\r\n\r\nPrussia        1.89 per 1000\r\nBelgium        2.8    \"\r\nEngland        4.5    \"\r\nStaffordshire  7.3    \"\r\n\r\nThis statement shows that more care is wanted in this last-named county\r\nespecially, as I find that the yield of coal in Belgium is half as much\r\nas in England. Long working in the dark, if one may so speak, is a cause\r\nof serious detriment to the sight, and the worker also suffers much from\r\nconstantly inhaling the small black dust, which in course of time\r\naffects the lungs, causing what is known as \"miner's asthma.\" Without\r\ngoing further into the unhealthy nature of the miner's work, it may be\r\ninteresting to mention something of the actual process, and having\r\nmyself been an eye-witness of it, I will explain it as shortly as I can.\r\nThe workers having arrived at the pit-mouth at their proper hours--for\r\nthe pit is worked by shifts, and consequently is generally worked day\r\nand night--the first operation is for each to procure his lamp from the\r\nlamp-keeper, receiving it lighted and locked; this is found to be\r\nnecessary, as from the small light given by the Davy-lamp the men are\r\noften tempted to open them, and some are even, so foolhardy as to carry\r\ntheir lamp on their cap and a candle in the hand, and hence a terrible\r\nexplosion may take place. A few words on the Davy-lamp, which came into\r\nuse about sixty years ago, may not be out of place here. This\r\nsafety-lamp of the miner not only shows the presence of gas, but\r\nprevents its explosion. It is constructed of gauze made of iron-wire\r\none-fortieth to one-sixtieth of an inch in diameter, having 784 openings\r\nto the inch, and the cooling effect of the current passing through the\r\nlamp prevents the gas taking fire. If we pour turpentine over a lighted\r\nsafety-lamp, it will show black smoke, but no flame. Provided with his\r\nlamp, the miner takes his place with others in the tub, which conveys\r\nhim with great rapidity to the bottom of the shaft. Here landed, he\r\ntakes his way to the workings, some of these, in large pits, being two\r\nmiles from the bottom of the shaft. To a novice this is not easy, as you\r\nhave to walk in a crouching manner most part of the way. Once there, he\r\nbegins in earnest, and drives at his pick for eight hours, the monotony\r\nonly relieved by his gathering the products into small railway waggons\r\nor tubs to be removed. This is done mostly by boys, but in the larger\r\nmines by ponies of the Shetland and other small breeds. The tubs are\r\ntaken to a part of the mine where, if one may so speak, the main line is\r\nreached, and then formed into trains, and taken to the shaft by means of\r\nan endless rope worked by an engine in the pit. In accomplishing all\r\nthis work, great care has to be taken that the current of air is not\r\nchanged or stopped. This is effected by means of doors placed in various\r\nparts of the mine, so as to stop the current and drive it in the\r\nrequired direction. These doors are kept by boys, whose duty it is to\r\nopen and close them for the passage of the coal tubs. Those boys are\r\noften allowed no light, and sit in a hole cut in the side of the road\r\nnear to the doors. Upon their carefulness the safety of the mine in a\r\ngreat measure depends, as if they neglect to shut the door the current\r\nof air is changed. I have been told that these boys are subject to\r\naccidents no less than the workers, for, sitting in the dark, and often\r\nalone for hours, they are very apt to go to sleep. To ensure being awoke\r\nat the proper time, they frequently lie down on the line of rails under\r\nthe rope, so that when the rope is started it may awake them by its\r\nmotion, but at times so sound is their sleep, that it has failed to\r\nrouse them in time, and a train of coal waggons has passed over them,\r\ncausing in most cases death.\r\n\r\nThe coal having been brought to the pit-mouth, it remains to be shown\r\nwhat becomes of this most valuable mineral, the consumption of which is\r\nnow so large in all parts of the globe. The next person employed in the\r\ntrade is the sailor, to convey it to the market, and the collier vessels\r\nare a valuable navy to the country, proving quite a nursery of seamen\r\nfor our royal marine service. Newcastle, Sunderland, West Hartlepool,\r\nand a large number of other ports along our coast, have an immense\r\namount of shipping employed exclusively in the coal trade--no less than\r\n5359 vessels carrying coal having entered the port of London alone in\r\n1873, and the average annual quantity of coal exported abroad during the\r\nthree years ending 1872 was 12,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nI will not now detain you longer on the subject of the extent and\r\nworking of coal, lest I should tire your patience; but before concluding\r\nI should wish to give some account of the uses to which this most\r\nvaluable product is applied. The main use of coal, as we all know, is to\r\nproduce heat, without which many a paterfamilias would grumble when the\r\ndinner-hour came and he had nothing hot to eat. It not only, however,\r\nsupplies heat, but the beauty of the processes for lighting up our\r\nhouses is now mainly derived from coal. The immense consumption of coal,\r\namong other things, is in the production of the vapour of water--steam,\r\nby which our thousands of engines on sea and land are made to perform\r\ntheir various appointed tasks. This production, formed of decayed\r\nvegetable matter, which in ages past nourished on the surface of the\r\nearth, as I have already shown, is again brought forth for our use, and\r\nis a testimony of the goodness and kindness of God in providing for our\r\nwants. By its heat some 10,000 locomotive engines are propelled, and\r\nmany hundreds of iron furnaces are kept in work, besides those for other\r\npurposes. It moves the machinery of at least 3000 factories, 2500 steam\r\nvessels, besides numerous smaller craft, and I cannot tell how many\r\nforges and fires. It aids in producing delicacies out of season in our\r\nhothouses. It lights our houses and streets with gas, the cheapest and\r\nbest of all lights--London alone in this way spending about £50,000 a\r\nyear. It gives us oil and tar to lubricate machinery and preserve timber\r\nand iron; and last, not least, by the aid of chemistry it is made to\r\nproduce many beautiful dyes, such as magenta and mauve, and also, in the\r\nsame way, gives perfumes resembling cloves, almonds, and spices.\r\n\r\nThe annual consumption of coal in Great Britain is reckoned to be not\r\nless than 80,000,000 tons. The amount raised in 1873 amounted to\r\n127,000,000 tons, and of this was imported into London alone 7,883,138\r\ntons--4,000,000 tons, or 15 per cent. of the total out-put of the\r\ncountry, being sent from Durham alone. The cost of the Wallsend coal on\r\nboard the ship may be stated at 10s. 6d. per ton; to this must be added\r\nthe charge at coal-market of 2s. 8d., freight say 5s. 9d., profit 7s.\r\n6d., so that a ton of coal of this kind will cost in your cellar in\r\nLondon the sum of £1, 6s. 5d.\r\n\r\nI think it is now time to conclude this most interesting subject, for\r\nthough I have by no means exhausted it, yet I fear I have said as much\r\nas a lecture will warrant. The subject shows us how mindful a kind\r\nProvidence has been of man, and to this nation in particular, for to our\r\ncoal we in a measure owe much of our greatness. So while we admire the\r\ngeology of our globe, let us not forget who made it and all that it\r\ncontains, and who, when He had finished the work, pronounced it all very\r\ngood. Let us so strive to live, that though we may be called away\r\nsuddenly, as 199 of our fellow-creatures were called by what is termed a\r\nmining accident, we may be ready to meet Him who not only made us, but\r\nmade the coal, and who, when man, at first made perfect, fell away, was\r\npleased to send a Saviour to redeem us and bring us to that light which\r\nfadeth not away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SCIENCE APPLIED TO ART_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA resumé of science and art requires to set forth what they have already\r\ndone and what they are now doing--to trace them down to our own time,\r\nand contrast their early stages with their present development. Giving\r\nto art and science all that is their due, it must be evident to every\r\none that they are primarily not of human origin, but owe their existence\r\nand progress to those inherent faculties of man which have been bestowed\r\nupon him by an Almighty Being--faculties given not only to fathom the\r\nworks of creation, and adapt them for man's use and benefit, but also\r\nthat they might show forth the praise and honour of their Creator, as\r\n\"the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His\r\nhandiwork.\" To set forth science and art before an Institution like that\r\nhere met together, behoves one to enter upon the subject in a way which\r\nwill not only interest but also instruct. But this is only an opening\r\naddress, and the lecturers who will follow me in due course will bring\r\nbefore you the special interests of those special subjects on which they\r\nare to treat. These cannot fail to interest as well as instruct those\r\nwho attend, their object being profit to the mind, and hence not only\r\nthe furtherance of mental culture, but increasing capabilities for\r\nmaterial prosperity.\r\n\r\nTo address a meeting in Glasgow gives one a feeling of pleasure; but,\r\nbefore going further, I trust that when I have finished you may not be\r\nable to say of me, as the two Highlanders did after leaving church--\"Eh,\r\nman! wasna that a grand discoorse?--it jumbled the head and confused the\r\nunderstanding!\" This city has brought forth one of the greatest of\r\nmen--though, like many others, he had to fight an uphill battle in his\r\nearly career--that man was James Watt. But what a career was his! and\r\nwhat a benefit to all now living has proved the result of his\r\nperseverance, for to his genius are we mainly indebted for the manifold\r\napplications of the wondrous power of _Steam_! That word is enough; and\r\nthe engines it now propels are a powerful testimony to the talent of\r\nthe great man who brought this mighty power to bear on the vast\r\nmachinery, not only of this great country, but of the whole world.\r\nContrast, for one thing, the travelling facilities of Watt's early days\r\nwith those we now possess through his persevering industry. Fourteen\r\ndays was then the usual time for a journey from Glasgow to London, while\r\nat present it can be performed in a less number of hours.\r\n\r\nRailways! what have they not done! We see towns spring up in a few years\r\nwhere only a few cottages formerly stood, and wild glens transformed\r\ninto fruitful valleys, by means of railways in their neighbourhood\r\ndeveloping traffic and trade, and creating employment by placing them in\r\ncommunication with larger towns, and thus opening up new sources of\r\nmaterial prosperity. Look at the magnitude of our railways. With respect\r\nto locomotives alone, in 1866 there were 8125 of these, and the work\r\nperformed by them was the haulage of 6,000,000 trains a distance of\r\n143,000,000 miles. As each engine possesses a draught-power equal to 450\r\nhorses, these 8125 locomotives consequently did the work of more than\r\n3,500,000 horses, and as the average durability of a locomotive is\r\ncomputed to be about fifteen years, each will have in that time\r\ntraversed nearly 300,000 miles! Then, again, there have to be replaced\r\nabout 500 worn-out locomotives every year, at a cost for each of about\r\n£2500 to £3000, entailing an annual expenditure of nearly £1,500,000\r\nsterling. All this money circulates for the country's benefit, keeping\r\nour iron, copper, and coal mines, our furnaces and our workshops, all at\r\nwork, and our people well and usefully employed, and thus proving one of\r\nthe greatest advantages of applied science and art to this country and\r\nthe world at large. If it had not been for steam, this valuable\r\nInstitution might not have been in existence, having for its chief\r\nobjects the promotion of the growth and increasing the usefulness of the\r\napplied sciences.\r\n\r\nWe have now one of the greatest triumphs of engineering art in the Mont\r\nCenis Railway, and this, though worked out under great difficulties, has\r\nproved a perfect success. Still more recently we have had brought under\r\nour notice the bold scheme of connecting Britain and France by a tunnel\r\nunder the English Channel--a project which, but a few years ago, any one\r\nwould have been thought mad to propose; but science has proved that it\r\ncan be carried out; and it is only a few days since a large meeting was\r\nheld in Liverpool with a view of tunnelling under the Mersey, and thus\r\nconnecting Liverpool and Birkenhead. Nor do these schemes seem at all\r\nvisionary when we learn that our go-ahead Transatlantic cousins have a\r\nproject before the Legislature of New Jersey for laying wooden tubes\r\nunderground, through which the mails and small parcels will be forwarded\r\nat the rate of 150 miles an hour! Through a similar tube, 6 feet in\r\ndiameter, laid under the East and Hudson Rivers, passengers are to be\r\ntransported from Brooklyn to Jersey city. A like scheme is in course of\r\nconstruction under the Thames.[A] Another American engineering triumph\r\nwill be the railway suspension bridge proposed to be built across the\r\nHudson River at Peekskill, in the hilly district known to New Yorkers as\r\nthe Highlands, which is to have a clear span of 1600 feet at a height of\r\n155 feet above high water.\r\n\r\nAnother grand and comparatively recent application of steam is in its\r\nadaptation to agriculture. Fields are now turned up by the\r\nsteam-plough--an invention as yet in its infancy--in a manner that could\r\nnever be done by mere hand-labour. Steam-culture has already penetrated\r\nas far north as John-o'-Groats, where I have one of the ploughs of Mr.\r\nHoward of Bedford, and but for its assistance I could not have taken in\r\nthe land I have now worked up. So great is the demand for\r\nsteam-cultivating apparatus, not only in Britain, but throughout the\r\nGerman plains and the flat alluvial soils of Egypt, that the makers have\r\nnow more orders than they can readily supply.\r\n\r\nIn all our manufactories steam proves itself the motive power, and there\r\nis hardly a large work without it. This city can show its weaving,\r\nspinning, bleaching, and dyeing works--all which have tended to raise\r\nGlasgow from the small town of Watt's time to the proud position it now\r\nholds of being the first commercial city of Scotland. In this city,\r\nsecond only to Manchester in the production of cotton goods, it cannot\r\nfail to be interesting to state, that in the first nine months of the\r\npresent year there has been exported 2,188,591,288 yards of cotton\r\npiece-goods manufactured in this country--a larger quantity by nearly\r\n150,000,000 yards than the corresponding period of 1867, the year of the\r\nlargest export of cotton manufactures ever known until then. Of course\r\nGlasgow has had its share in this great branch of export trade,\r\nrendering it large, wealthy, and populous--results which have mainly\r\nfollowed from the application of science to art.\r\n\r\nLast, not least, see what steam has enabled us to do in regard to the\r\nfood for the mind, both in printing it and afterwards in its\r\ndistribution. Look, for instance, to Printing House Square--to the\r\n\"Times\" newspaper. In the short space of one hour 20,000 copies are\r\nthrown off the printing-machine, and, thanks to the express train, the\r\nsame day the paper can be read in Glasgow. Still further in this\r\ndirection, the value of steam is also shown by its having enabled us to\r\nproduce cheap literature, so strikingly instanced in the world-famed\r\nworks of Sir Walter Scott, which we are now enabled to purchase at the\r\nsmall sum of sixpence for each volume--a result which well shows the\r\napplication of science to art.\r\n\r\nLet us now observe what a varied number of mechanical and agricultural\r\nappliances are required to furnish us with this cheap literature. There\r\nis agriculture, in the growth of the fibre that produces the material of\r\nwhich the printing paper is made; then the flax-mill is brought into\r\nplay to produce the yarn to be woven; then weaving to produce the\r\ncloth; after this, dyeing. Then the fine material is used for various\r\npurposes too numerous to mention; and after it has performed its own\r\nproper work, and is cast away as rags, no more to be thought of by its\r\nowner, it is gathered up as a most precious substance by the papermaker,\r\nwho shows us the true value of the cast-off rags. Subjected to the\r\nbeautiful and costly machinery of the paper-mill, the rags turn out an\r\narticle of so much value that without it the world would almost come to\r\na stand-still. Yet further, we have next the miner, who by his labour\r\nbrings to the surface of the earth the metal required to produce the\r\ntype for printing; after this the printing-press; and next the chemist,\r\nwho by certain chemical combinations gives us the ink that is to spread\r\nknowledge to the world, by making clear to the eye the thoughts of\r\nauthors who have applied their minds for the instruction and amusement\r\nof their fellow-men. But we do not end here; consider also that each and\r\nall, the farmer, the spinner, the weaver, the chemist, the miner, the\r\nprinter, and the author, must respectively have a profit out of their\r\nvarious branches of industry, and does it not strike one forcibly what\r\na boon to the world is this all-important application of science to\r\nart--putting within the reach of the poor man and the working man the\r\nmeans of cultivating his mind, and so, by giving him matters of deep\r\ninterest to think over, keeping him from idleness and perhaps sin (for\r\nidleness is the root of most evil), and making him a happy family-man\r\ninstead of a public-house frequenter.\r\n\r\nMany were strongly opposed to the introduction of steam, and would\r\nrather have seen it put down, and the old coach and printing-press,\r\nloom, spinning-wheel, and flail kept in use, fearing that machinery\r\nwould limit employment; and a hard fight it has been to carry forward\r\nall that has hitherto been done. But what has proved to be the result?\r\nThousands are now employed where formerly a few people sufficed, and we\r\nare all benefited in having better and cheaper goods, books, provisions,\r\nand all things needful. There is therefore the satisfaction of knowing\r\nthat, by the thousand and one applications of steam, the physical,\r\nmental, and even moral condition of the people has been greatly\r\nameliorated; in this way again proving a triumph for the application of\r\nscience to art.\r\n\r\nGlasgow is not only famous for its multifarious applications of water\r\nin its finely divided gaseous form of steam, but it has made admirable\r\nuse of that element in its more familiar and fluid form, as shown in the\r\ngigantic undertaking of bringing a water-supply into this thriving and\r\npopulous city. The peaceful waters of a Highland lake are suddenly\r\nturned from their quiet resting-place, where they have remained in peace\r\nfor generations, the admiration of all beholders, and made to take an\r\nactive part in contributing to the health, wealth, and comfort of\r\nGlasgow. The beautiful Loch Katrine has been brought into the city,\r\nfurnishing a stream of pure water to minister to the wants of all\r\nclasses of the people--an undertaking which a few years ago would have\r\nbeen pronounced impossible; but here again science and art have\r\nprevailed, and brought about this all-important object and greatly\r\ndesired and inestimable boon. The great capital of England itself cannot\r\nboast of such an advantage, and must still be content to drink water\r\ncontaminated with impurities. Does not this speak volumes for the wealth\r\nand energy of Glasgow? What so conducive to health and cleanliness (and\r\ncleanliness is akin to godliness) as a pure and perfect supply of water\r\nsuch as you now possess; and you have great reason to be grateful for\r\nthis beneficent application of science and art. With a worldwide\r\ncelebrity for your waterworks, you have cause also to be proud of your\r\nchemical works, and that famous chimney of St. Rollox, one of the\r\nloftiest structures in the world. There are few cities more highly\r\nfavoured than this. Would not Captain Shaw be glad if, in London, he had\r\nthe head or command of water such as you have from Loch Katrine to save\r\nthe great metropolis from the destruction by fire that they are in daily\r\ndread of? In Glasgow we hardly want this--our grand Loch Katrine does it\r\nall.\r\n\r\nTurn to your river, the beautiful Clyde, which eighty years ago could be\r\nforded at Erskine, while Port Glasgow was as far as ships could then\r\ncome up--a striking contrast to what is now to be seen at the\r\nBroomielaw, where the largest steamers and ships drawing thirty feet of\r\nwater are moored in the very heart of the city, discharging produce from\r\nall parts of the world. What has done this but steam--the energy of man;\r\nsteam cutting a channel by dredging to admit of ships passing so far up\r\nthe river: and this has been to Glasgow a great source of wealth by the\r\npromotion of commerce. Art has been permitted to work out great things\r\nfor your city, and I trust still greater things are in store. Take the\r\ntrade now in full progress on the banks of the Clyde. The shipbuilding\r\nis fast leaving the Thames and finding its way here. It is a pleasure to\r\nhear people say: \"There is a fine ship--she is Clyde-built.\"--\"Who built\r\nher? Was it Napier, or Thomson, or Tod, or M'Gregor, or Randolph &\r\nElder, or Caird, or Denny of Dumbarton, or Cunliff & Dunlop?\" Pardon me\r\nif I have left out any name, for all are good builders. Then, again, it\r\nmay be asked: \"Who engined these ships?\"--\"Oh, Clyde engineers, or those\r\nwho built them.\" I had the pleasure of being this year on board the\r\nTrinity yacht \"Galatea,\" on a cruise when fourteen knots an hour were\r\naccomplished; and that yacht is a good specimen of what Clyde\r\nshipbuilders can turn out. She was built by Caird. I have also had the\r\npleasure of a trip in the \"Russia,\" one of the finest screw-vessels\r\nafloat, built by Thomson; and she has proved herself perhaps the fastest\r\nof sea-going steamers. Does not all this show what science applied to\r\nart has done?\r\n\r\nGlasgow has also a College of the first order, one that is looked up to\r\nas sending men of high standing forth to the world. Watt worked under\r\nits roof as a poor mathematical instrument maker, and although enjoying\r\nlittle of its valuable instruction, he produced the steam-engine--a\r\nlesson as to what those ought to do towards promoting the application of\r\nscience to art who have the full benefit of a scientific training such\r\nas your College affords.\r\n\r\nEach day brings forth something new--the electric telegraph, for\r\ninstance, by which our thoughts and desires are transmitted to all parts\r\nof the world, so to speak, in a moment of time. When we think that we\r\nare within an instant of America, it gives one a feeling of awe, for it\r\nshows to what an extent we have been permitted to carry the application\r\nof science to art. A small wire is carried across the great Atlantic,\r\nand immediate communication is the result. The achievements of science\r\nwere shown to a great extent in the laying of this cable, and perhaps\r\nstill more in its recovery after it had been broken. A small cable is\r\nlost at the bottom of the ocean, far from the land, and in water about\r\ntwo miles in depth--a ship goes out, discovers the spot, and then\r\ngrappling irons are lowered. Science with its long arm, as it were,\r\nreaches down the almost unfathomable abyss, and with its powerful hand\r\nsecures and brings to the surface of the ocean the fractured cable,\r\nwhich is again made to connect the Old and New Worlds--thus verifying\r\nalmost the words of Shakespeare, when he speaks of calling \"spirits from\r\nthe vasty deep.\" After splicing the cable, the vessel proceeds with the\r\nwork of paying it out, as it sails across the Atlantic; and once more\r\nscience and art find a successful issue, for Europe and America are\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nWhat the combination of science and art has done is, however, not yet\r\nexhausted: witness the splendid specimens of artillery now produced by\r\nSir Joseph Whitworth and Sir William Armstrong--weapons by which\r\nprojectiles are thrown with an almost irresistible force. The beauty of\r\ntheir construction is a triumph to art, and their mathematical truth a\r\ntriumph to science. One thing follows another, and no sooner have men of\r\noriginality and observation perfected the means of destruction, when\r\nothers press forward and furnish the means of defence. Our armour-clads,\r\nsuch as the \"Warrior\" and others which lately visited these waters, have\r\nthus been called into existence, and they are splendid specimens of\r\nwhat science applied to art can achieve.\r\n\r\nThe Menai Bridge is another instance of the power of man in applied\r\nscience. A railway bridge is required to further communication, but\r\nGovernment demands that the navigation of the Strait shall not be\r\nimpeded. The mind of a great man is called into action, and by applying\r\nscientific principles to engineering art, we have that wonder of the\r\nworld, the great tubular bridge over the Menai Straits. This work\r\nrequired a mind of no ordinary nature, but such a one was found in the\r\ncelebrated Robert Stephenson. I am proud to say I was privileged to have\r\nhim as a friend, and I greatly lamented his death, not only as a friend,\r\nbut as an irreparable loss to the world of science.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of science applied to art--and not the least\r\nimportant--is the adaptation of glass to form the lens which enables the\r\nflame of a lamp to be seen from a great distance. What this has done for\r\nthe mariner is shown in our lighthouses, which enable him to know where\r\nhe is by night as well as by day, for the lights are made to revolve, to\r\nbe stationary, or to show various colours or flashes, which reveal to\r\nhim their respective positions. The compass also, though ancient, is\r\nstill an application of applied science, and by it the mariner is\r\nenabled to guide his ship safely over the ocean. A very beautiful\r\ninstance of applied science to art is electrometallurgy, in which metals\r\nare deposited by means of the galvanic battery in any required form or\r\nshape, and this process of gilding and plating is executed with\r\nmarvellous rapidity. All these various instances show what the mind of\r\nman has done, and is doing; but the applications of science to art are\r\nso endless, that even their simple enumeration could not be included in\r\nthe limits of an opening address, for there are few things to which\r\nscience cannot be applied. One of the most recent and beautiful is the\r\nart of photography, where, by means of applied chemistry, aided by the\r\nrays of the sun, there can be produced the most pleasing and lifelike\r\nrepresentations. This new application of chemistry is a most interesting\r\none, which shows that we do not stand still, and as long as arts and\r\nscience are permitted to be practised by us we are not intended to stand\r\nstill, but to exercise our minds to the utmost to unravel those\r\nmysteries of nature that are yet to be developed.\r\n\r\nChemistry, as a regular branch of natural science, is of comparatively\r\nrecent origin, and can hardly be said to date earlier than the latter\r\nthird of last century. The Greek philosophers had some vague yet\r\nprofound ideas on this subject, but their acquaintance was limited to\r\nspeculations _à priori_, founded on general and often inaccurate\r\nobservations of natural occurrences. Yet their acuteness was such, that\r\nsome of their speculations as to the constituent properties of matter\r\ncoincide in a wonderful degree with those which now prevail among modern\r\nphilosophers. It is not easy to define what chemistry is in a few words,\r\nbut it may be described as the science which has for its object the\r\ninvestigation of all elementary bodies which exist in the universe, with\r\nthe view of determining their composition and properties. It also seeks\r\nto detect the laws which regulate their mutual relations, and the\r\nproportions in which these elements will combine together to form the\r\ncompounds which constitute the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms,\r\nas well as the properties of these various compounds. The ancients\r\nadmitted only four elements--earth, air, fire, and water. Chemists now\r\nfar exceed this number, and seek to show what these elements are\r\ncomposed of by analysing them into the various gases, solids, and\r\nliquids.\r\n\r\nAstronomy is the most ancient of all the sciences. The Chaldeans, the\r\nEgyptians, the Chinese, the Hindoos, Gauls, and Peruvians, each regarded\r\nthemselves as the inventors of astronomy, an honour which Josephus\r\ndeprives them of by ascribing it to the antediluvian patriarchs. From\r\nthe few facts to be gleaned out of the vague accounts by ancient authors\r\nregarding the Chaldeans, it may be inferred that their boasted knowledge\r\nof this science was confined to observations of the simplest kind,\r\nunassisted by any instruments whatever. The Egyptians, again, though\r\nanciently considered the rivals of the Chaldeans in the cultivation of\r\nthis science, have yet left behind them still fewer records of their\r\nlabours, though it is so far certain that their astronomical knowledge\r\nwas even greater than that of the Chaldeans. The Phoenicians seem to\r\nhave excelled in the art of navigation, and would no doubt direct their\r\ncourse among the islands of the Mediterranean by the stars; but if they\r\nhad any further speculative notions of astronomy, they were probably\r\nderived from the Chaldeans or Egyptians. In China, astronomy has been\r\nknown from the remotest ages, and has always been considered as a\r\nscience necessary and indispensable to the civil government of the\r\nCelestial Empire. On considering the accounts of Chinese astronomy, we\r\nfind it consisted only in the practice of certain observations, which\r\nled to nothing more than the knowledge of a few isolated facts, and they\r\nare indebted to foreigners for any further improvements they have since\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks seem to have made the most early advances in astronomy; for\r\nnotwithstanding that the art of observation was still in its infancy, we\r\nare indebted to the labours and speculations of ancient Greek\r\nphilosophers for raising astronomy to the dignity of a science. The\r\ncomplicated but ingenious hypotheses of the Greek Ptolemy prepared the\r\nway for the discovery of the elliptic form of the planetary orbits and\r\nother astronomical laws by the German Kepler, which again conducted our\r\nEnglish Newton to the discovery of the law of gravitation. I am not,\r\nhowever, desirous of giving this meeting a lecture on astronomy--I shall\r\nleave that to Professor Grant. But it is singular that I should have\r\ncome here on a day on which one of the now known observations and\r\nmovements of the planets has taken place--the transit of Mercury. This\r\nwas calculated to occur this day by the science of astronomy, and it is\r\nalso known when it will again occur, namely, on the 6th of May 1878. I\r\nwill end this subject by saying, that the discoveries in astronomy in\r\nthe last and present centuries have been so many and interesting, that\r\nit would be quite impossible for me to enter here minutely upon them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,--What have science and art done for us? They have\r\ncultivated our minds--they have made us think, wonder, and admire, and I\r\ntrust caused us to adore and reverence the Creator of this vast\r\nuniverse. They have taught us the knowledge and value of time, and have\r\nalso shown the value of what man has been enabled to work out for his\r\nown benefit and that of the world at large.\r\n\r\nThe chemist deals with the various substances brought under his notice,\r\nthereby acquiring a knowledge of their properties, enabling him to\r\nproduce results which are truly beneficial. This knowledge is power.\r\n\r\nThe painter makes the features of Nature his study, and by his brush\r\ndelineates them on the canvas, and thus by knowledge of art he exhibits\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer's science is one of vast magnitude and importance--the\r\nstudy of it embracing both science and art: science in the various\r\nintricate calculations he requires to make in connection with the\r\nheavenly bodies. By his researches we have discovered the form of the\r\nearth and other planets, their respective distances from each other,\r\ntheir revolutions, their eclipses and their orbits, and, more wonderful\r\nstill, the precise time when the various movements of each occur. In\r\nart, the astronomer has originated and perfected the many powerful and\r\nbeautiful instruments now required for taking observations, and these,\r\nwhen compared with the instruments in use in bypast times, are excellent\r\nevidences of modern progress in this direction. Our wonder is excited\r\nwhen we look at the instruments formerly in use; that so much was done\r\nthrough them, and the advance made by art in the perfection of those now\r\nadopted, show us again that knowledge is power.\r\n\r\nThe navigator, by a combination of astronomy and seamanship, is enabled\r\nto plough the great deep, and at all times by mathematical calculation\r\nto discover the exact position of his ship. What, however, would he be\r\nwithout the aid of art? The compass, the sextant, or quadrant, &c., are\r\nthe means which enable him to attain these grand results, and to bring\r\nhis ship to the desired haven. The use of these is knowledge, and this\r\nknowledge is power.\r\n\r\nAlike with all other things which science and art have called into use,\r\nknowledge is power, and this power was given by the Almighty, as I said\r\nat the beginning of this lecture, to enable man to fathom the works of\r\ncreation. Let us then so live that we may ever admire the results of the\r\nlabours of science and of art, and at the same time ever remember Him\r\nwho has given us the power to discover and use them for our\r\nbenefit,--thanking God, who first made all things and pronounced them\r\nvery good, for His great mercy toward us.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Now carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A PENNY'S WORTH_;\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\n\"TAKE CARE OF THE PENCE, AND THE POUNDS WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA penny seems a small sum to talk about, and with many, I am sorry to\r\nsay, is looked upon as so insignificant as to be considered almost\r\nworthless; but I hope, before I have done, to show you something of the\r\ngreat value of even a penny, and of the effects and products we have\r\nbeen enabled to produce and dispose of with a reasonable profit at the\r\ncost of one penny. A much smaller sum than this was looked upon and\r\nregarded as of inestimable value by our blessed Saviour, when He saw the\r\nrich men and the widow casting their offerings into the treasury, for He\r\nsaid: \"All these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of\r\nGod: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.\"\r\n\r\nNow what did this widow cast in? Two mites, which make one farthing.\r\nThough this took place more than eighteen hundred years ago, it shows to\r\nus even now the great value of small things when given with the heart\r\nand used in the right way.\r\n\r\nMoney is a most desirable thing, and without it the business of the\r\nworld would come to a stand-still, but how to spend it aright is a\r\nmatter of grave thought, for it may with ease be spent in luxury, but it\r\nrequires a mind to use it profitably. Both pleasure and profit may be\r\ngained by prudent and proper expenditure, and to show how even a limited\r\nincome may enjoy great comfort at home (and there is, I hope you think,\r\nno place like home, and one's own home-fireside), I have ventured to\r\nbring before you at this time what can be done for one penny.\r\n\r\nThe penny itself is a matter which leads one into thought. The vastness\r\nof mind which has been brought to bear on the production of the coin is\r\nitself worthy of consideration. Before any coin can be sanctioned by the\r\nrealm, it has to go through the ordeal of Her Majesty's Government, and\r\nafter all has been done to the satisfaction of the authorities, a little\r\nbit of copper--though now, for the good of our pockets, mixed with an\r\nalloy--is made to minister to our wants in ways which I hope to lay\r\nbefore you as plainly and shortly as possible. First and foremost we\r\nmust have that great and valuable thing heat, for without heat generated\r\nby fire we could have no penny. One of the first things required to\r\nproduce this heat is wood. Now the wood must be grown,--trees attended\r\nto with care and at great cost. Years pass before they are either fit\r\nfor beauty or use, yet, during the time of their growth, the smaller\r\nbranches that are lopped off form just what is required to set on fire\r\nthe coal and coke to produce the heat which is necessary for smelting\r\nand blast furnaces, for our own domestic fires, and various other uses.\r\nA faggot of these lopped branches can be bought for a penny. Having thus\r\nfound out, as a beginning, one thing which can be obtained for a penny,\r\nlet us go on to see what has to be attended to and encountered before\r\nthis valuable coin can be made. Sums of money have to be spent, risks\r\nvery great have to be entered into, and beautiful machinery constructed\r\nbefore it can be placed in our pockets. The mines of Cornwall have to be\r\nreached for both copper and tin--a matter of great cost to the pockets\r\nof speculators, and of anxiety to the minds of engineers, who lay\r\nthemselves out to gain the material. Furnaces have to be built to smelt\r\nthe ore and bring it into a workable condition. The Mint is then, after\r\nthe metal is ready, called into requisition to produce a coin which,\r\nafter all this labour and expense, is only a penny.\r\n\r\nI come now to tell some of the things which can be accomplished and\r\nproduced for a penny. One of the earliest publications of any note was\r\nthe \"Penny Magazine,\" which is endeared to my memory as having shown me\r\nthe earliest of George Stephenson's great works--the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway. This magazine has now passed away, but it has been\r\namply replaced by others of equal merit, carrying out its principles of\r\ngiving a sound and cheap literature to the people; it was a boon to all\r\nwho cared for instruction, and at the same time had to take care of a\r\npenny. Now we have our daily papers at a penny, and of the 1711\r\nnewspapers issued (1876) in the United Kingdom, 808 are sold at this\r\nsmall price. Look at those papers, the \"Telegraph,\" \"Standard,\" and\r\nmany others; are they not a light that has shone over our world, showing\r\nwhat man has been enabled to do for his fellows, in being able to\r\ndisseminate the knowledge of what is transpiring over the world to their\r\nreaders, both near and far off, and all for only one penny! Has this\r\nbeen done without labour? No. What has caused it but the earnest desire\r\nto know the events of daily life in as short a time as possible. I do\r\nnot care to vouch for what I now say, but I should think that about\r\n20,000 copies are thrown off of the \"Daily Telegraph\" in an hour, and\r\nthese can be bought for one penny each. This penny's worth has cost a\r\ngreat amount of thought to bring about. Besides the various manufactures\r\nwhich are required for this result, the daily paper also brings to its\r\naid the agriculturist as regards the paper; for though this was at first\r\nonly made of rags, we now produce it from straw, and I have made it from\r\nthistles, whilst it has also been made from wood and other things. The\r\nrags, of course, were derived from agriculture in as far as flax\r\nrequired to be grown, but now the farmer gets his grain from the crop,\r\nand the straw left is made into paper--the chief agent in distributing\r\nthrough the world the thoughts of the learned in science, arts,\r\nliterature, and politics. With what eagerness do we look for our paper\r\nin the morning, and with what pleasure do we pay our penny for it! A\r\npenny's worth with respect to this material does not stop here. Look at\r\nour beautiful and not costly decorations; see what a charming room we\r\ncan show, produced by a wall-paper at a cost of one penny a yard. Some\r\nof these coloured decorations produce an eye-deception that quite, as\r\nthe Scotch would say, \"jumbles the judgment and confounds the\r\nunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\nWe have not done with luxuries, and I will now bring one before you\r\nthat, like many others, if used aright, there is no harm in, and which I\r\nlook upon as a means of keeping up social good-fellowship among all. I\r\nmean _smoking_. Now the use of tobacco in itself is harmless, but used\r\nin excess is not only dangerous, but acts as a poison. I like a pipe,\r\nbut I find at the same time it is needful to have a light. The ingenuity\r\nof man has supplied my want and wish, and I can now get a light from an\r\narticle which, to look at, seems only something black tipped with red.\r\nThe labour required to produce this small box of lights, as it is\r\ncalled, is wonderful--the chemist, the wood merchant, the mechanician\r\n(and I am sorry to say, also the surgeon, from the deleterious effects\r\nof the phosphorus on the human frame), have all to bring their work to\r\nbear on the production of this most useful article. Yet, after all, it\r\nis sold and bought for one penny a box. Messrs. Bryant & May profess to\r\nsave your houses from fire for this sum by using their matches, and I\r\nthink they are right. Fire and heat are among our best friends, but are\r\nalso dangerous enemies; and I am sure a penny spent on Bryant & May's\r\nmatches is _well_ spent. I do not wish to disparage other makers--far\r\nfrom it; but a match that will only ignite on the box is an article all\r\nhouseholders should procure, not only for their own protection, but also\r\nfor that of their neighbours.\r\n\r\nA very striking instance of the value of a penny is set before us in\r\nthat most wonderful system the penny-postage, the institution of which\r\nwas a boon to the kingdom that cannot be too highly appreciated. It\r\nenables rich and poor alike to bring their thoughts and desires into\r\ncommunication with each other, and so relieve anxious cares in regard\r\nto the health and wealth, the joys and sorrows of friends in an easy\r\nmanner. A penny stamp can convey all our requirements, whether for good\r\nor for evil, and many a large sum is now transmitted under its care. I\r\nhave been told that as many as 60,000 letters have passed through the\r\ntravelling post-office of the London and North-Western Railway in one\r\nnight. How could this great correspondence ever have been carried on but\r\nfor railways; and but for the foresight of Sir Rowland Hill this system\r\nmight still have been in the background. It is clearly in my\r\nrecollection when 1 s. 1-1/2 d. was the charge for a letter from London\r\nto Edinburgh, and that was for what was then called a _single_ letter;\r\nnow you may send as much as you like under a certain weight for one\r\npenny.\r\n\r\nTravelling is now also a thing within the reach of all, for you can\r\ntravel for one penny a mile, and this at a rate of speed that could not\r\nbe done a few years ago. So much for railways.\r\n\r\nHaving begun with matters more especially affecting older people, it\r\nwould be hard indeed to leave out the younger branches, and the means\r\nthat are now employed not only for their comfort, but their amusement.\r\nAmong other requirements for them we may class their toys. They are in a\r\nsense most needful, as well as useful, for our children, and from many\r\nof the ingenious toys now-a-days we can acquire a great deal of\r\nknowledge, useful to ourselves and of advantage to others. The beauty of\r\ntheir manufacture is a striking instance of the ingenuity of man as\r\napplied to small things, seeing that toys, so to speak, are only made\r\nfor a few days' enjoyment, and are then almost certain to be broken. But\r\nfor their short and transient existence what an amount of mental energy\r\nhas been brought to bear--the fancy of the child has to be studied and\r\nprovided for, in a way to please, gratify, and amuse, teaching the young\r\nidea how to shoot: all this for one penny. Look at the carts, horses,\r\nand other articles innumerable that are to be bought at the bazaars in\r\nLondon for a penny, and do they not bring before us in a striking manner\r\nwhat has been done for the benefit of the young. These toys, which only\r\ncost a penny, have caused many hard and anxious thoughts, are the means\r\nof giving work to thousands, and enabling these thousands to live an\r\nhonest and happy life by furnishing a paying living, while at the same\r\ntime they minister to the acquirements of those who when young require\r\namusement. All this is done for a penny's worth; but how divided is this\r\nbefore the wonderful toy is produced! We have wood, iron, copper, tin,\r\nlead--I may say, all the metals, even the most precious (for gold is\r\nfrequently used in the production of a toy that can be bought for a\r\npenny), are employed. Not only have these to be utilised, but they have\r\nfirst to be obtained--some by the growth of timber, others by mining,\r\nthen by the heat of the furnace, then by hammer and workman, then by the\r\nchemist and colour-maker, then by the maker of the toy--many of these\r\nemployed at large wages; and yet you receive for your children an\r\narticle which not only gives instruction, but the greatest amusement,\r\nall for one penny.\r\n\r\nAn old saying, but a very true one, \"Cleanliness is next to godliness;\"\r\nand this brings us to a luxury which, though long known in France, has\r\nonly been lately introduced here. This is the shoe-black. You come up to\r\nhim, dirty from the mud of the streets of London, and in a very short\r\ntime you have your boots shining for a penny. This penny's worth brings\r\nbefore us a large amount of thought before it can be earned and paid\r\nfor. We have to begin with the farmer, who feeds the animal that, after\r\nwe have eaten a good dish from and think no more of, yet furnishes the\r\nhair which is made into brushes by the brushmaker; the carpenter has to\r\nmake the box to hold them; the blacking-maker also comes to the service;\r\nand the tailor to give the uniform red coat worn by the Shoeblack\r\nBrigade--yet after all this, you can get your boots blacked, and that\r\nwell done, for one penny. Out of their earnings, at some stations the\r\nboys--so I was told a short time ago--have to pay 2s. 6d. a day for\r\nleave to stand at their station.\r\n\r\nI have gone a long way on things that can be obtained for a penny, but I\r\nhave not yet got to the greatest and most valuable--a thing which is to\r\nbe obtained for even less than the widow's mite. It is this: \"Come ye,\r\nbuy and eat, without money and without price, for My word is meat\r\nindeed, and My word is drink indeed.\" Christ says this, and man cannot\r\ndeny it. I am not going to preach a sermon, but as things have come\r\nbefore me, I have put them down.\r\n\r\nSeeing what a penny can do, let us turn to some of the results. A penny\r\na week at a school, and what can be gained? A child is educated to use\r\nthe talents given him or her, so as to work out an honest living, and is\r\nthere taught what it can do for the life that now is and that which is\r\nto come. The value of education is so great that it cannot be\r\nover-estimated. A young man I knew got into a railway workshop. He saved\r\nenough to go to Australia, where he has now made a large sum of money.\r\nHe left this country with less than £50 in his pocket. He knew work and\r\nbusiness, thanks to education, and had a determined desire to work his\r\nway. I wish it was so all over England, for I know in the Midland\r\nCounties every one will not leave home. You must leave home, at least\r\nfor a season, if you wish to get on in the world. Nothing is to be\r\ngained in this world without striving for it. Here is work, but after\r\ndeath there is rest, but not till then. So, in conclusion, let me say,\r\nLet us all remember that while on earth it is a season for work. _Here\r\nis work_--work for the body, work for the mind, and, above all, work to\r\nprepare the soul for eternity. So that when we come to die, we may not\r\nonly be able to look back on a life in which we have spent a penny\r\naright, but be able to look forward to that life where is everlasting\r\npeace and joy, through Christ in God. And may our last words be--_Here\r\nwas_ work, but _there is_ rest, through Christ our Saviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PAST AND PRESENT MEANS OF COMMUNICATION_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may, I think, commence by saying, \"Lord, so teach us to number our\r\ndays that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom,\" for, as David says,\r\n\"What is man that Thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that Thou\r\nvisitest him? Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of Thy\r\nhands, and hast put all things in subjection under his feet.\" The\r\ndifference of past and present means of communication are so great, that\r\nit is no easy task to enter into a discussion on the subject; but it\r\nleads one to gravely consider what is said in the 90th Psalm: \"So teach\r\nus to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.\" To\r\naddress an association such as I have now the honour and pleasure of\r\ndoing, gives one a feeling of interest, as well as a feeling of\r\nresponsibility, for as I have been kindly asked to close the course of\r\nlectures for this session, such an address is looked to in general with\r\nexpectation. Do not hope for too much from me; but I trust that, when I\r\nhave concluded, you will not be able to pay me the compliment an\r\nold Highland woman did to her minister on seeing him after\r\nchurch-service--\"Ah, maister, this discoursing will never do, for I\r\nwasna weel asleep till ye were done.\" Having said this by way of\r\nintroduction, I think it devolves upon me in some way first to explain\r\nwhat is the meaning of the subject of Communication. It may be briefly\r\nstated to be _a means to an end_--an intercourse or passage of either\r\nthe body from one place to another, or of the thoughts of one person to\r\nanother. And as I begin with the communication of the body, I cannot do\r\nbetter than name some of the methods by which communication is carried\r\non, and shall commence with _Roads, Coaches, Railways, Canals_, and\r\n_Steamers_. Then, for mind, I will take _Books, Printing, Letters,\r\nExhibitions_, and _Telegraphs_.\r\n\r\nOur age has so advanced, that though Methuselah lived nearly one\r\nthousand years, yet he in his age did not live as long as we do now.\r\nSee what science and art have done for us. We now do more in one day\r\nthan could be done in a month some very few years ago; and, as far as\r\ntravelling about the world is concerned, I can say that I have been from\r\nJohn-o'-Groat's House to Brighton, thence into Hertfordshire, thence\r\nback to London, from there to Edinburgh, thence to John-o'-Groat's, and\r\nhere I am before you, without fatigue, or a thought that I should not be\r\npresent in time. What has enabled us to do this but the determination of\r\nman to communicate with his fellow-men, and his thirst for the knowledge\r\nof what is doing in places where he, as an individual, could not be\r\npresent. When there were no roads, it was no easy matter to move about,\r\nso the people remained at rest. But the Romans, a people who aspired to\r\nconquer the world, were not a people to sleep and let things stand\r\nstill. They began the making of roads in Britain, and to them we owe the\r\nfirst of our greatness. They saw, as every wise man now sees, that the\r\nfirst thing to the improvement of land and property is easy\r\ncommunication, and facilities for bringing the things needed for the\r\nimprovement of the land, and the means also of export for the produce.\r\nThe earliest roads were, as we may say, right on end; and the Roman\r\nroads, as I hear, have borne the traffic of two thousand years. I hope I\r\nmay say that even a Roman road would not bear the traffic of a town like\r\nGreenock for anything like that period of time, or I fear the commerce\r\nof this populous and most thriving town would be in a bad way. The great\r\nTelford and Macadam are the persons to be thanked for our beautiful\r\nsystem of road-making, and no person can, I am sure, deny the utility of\r\ntheir plans. As I said, roads are a means of communication for the body,\r\nand also for the mind; and therefore, now that their advantages are\r\nseen, we should strive to further their advance in all districts.\r\n\r\n_Coaches_.--We come now to the means of communication on the roads for\r\nthe body, and also for the mind, as both must go together--viz., the\r\ncoach and the carriage or cart (for before the roads were made we had no\r\ncoaches). In the first place, these carts or carriages were rude and\r\nheavy waggons, without springs or other comfort; but still they served\r\nto convey the body, and the mind that went with it at last discovered,\r\nby degrees, that conveyances could be constructed so as to cause less\r\nwear and tear on animal life. The result of time and labour has been the\r\nelegant constructions of the present day. The first hackney-coaches were\r\nstarted in London, A.D. 1625, by a Captain Bailey. Another conveyance\r\nfor the body, the sedan-chair, was introduced first into England in\r\n1584, and came into fashion in London in 1634. The late Sir John\r\nSinclair was called a fool because he said a mail-coach would come from\r\nLondon to Thurso. I am glad to say that he _saw_ it, and it opened up a\r\ncommunication for the body and mind that has worked wonders in the far\r\nNorth. We now have a railway.\r\n\r\n_Steam._--We proceed next to the grandest stage--or, as it is said in\r\nthe North, \"We took a start.\" What place have we to thank for this great\r\nstart, but the very town in which I have the honour to give this closing\r\naddress. Was not James Watt born here? The 19th January 1736 was a great\r\nday for England, Scotland, and the world at large, for that day brought\r\ninto the world a man who, by his talents and by his observations of what\r\nothers had done before him, was the means of bringing to a workable\r\nstate that all-powerful and most useful machine, the steam-engine. The\r\npeople of Greenock may well indeed feel proud of being citizens of a\r\ntown that produced such a man; for though many places have given birth\r\nto great and valuable men, and persons who rendered the world vast and\r\nlasting service, yet, I may safely say, no one has surpassed James Watt\r\nin the benefits he has bestowed on the world, on its trade, its\r\ncommerce, and its means of communication for both body and mind, as the\r\nproducer of the steam-engine. There were not even coaches in his time,\r\nand his first journey to London was performed on horseback, a ten days'\r\nride, very different to our ten or twelve hours now-a-days. His life and\r\ndetermination show what a man can do, both for himself and his\r\nfellow-men, and are a bright example to be followed by all those\r\nespecially who belong to such associations as the one I now have the\r\nhonour to address. He not only thought, but carried out his thoughts to\r\na practical issue, and, though laughed at, he still stuck to his great\r\nwork, and by his perseverance gave to the world one of its greatest\r\nboons, and certainly its greatest motive power--the steam-engine. The\r\nfirst use of the engine, as you well know, was the pumping of water.\r\nRude were the machines made by Savory, Newcombe, and others, to achieve\r\nthe desired end, but Watt, in his small room in the cottage at Glasgow,\r\nat last brought about a triumph that the world at large now feels and\r\nacknowledges. I will not go further into the history of a man so well\r\nknown and appreciated, as his memory must be here, but will go on to say\r\nsomething briefly on the results of the operations of the mind over the\r\nmaterial placed before it, to bring into form and make it practically\r\nuseful for the advantage of man.\r\n\r\n_Steamers_.--Greenock must see and value the great power at her disposal\r\nin the steam-ship. She has now her large building yards, and it was from\r\nher yards that, in 1719, the first ship--belonging to Greenock, and I\r\nbelieve built there--sailed for America, and from that time the trade\r\nincreased rapidly. And I believe Glasgow launched the first Scotch ship\r\nthat ever crossed the Atlantic in 1718, only one year in advance of\r\nGreenock. The large building yards of Greenock bring into the town sums\r\nof money which, but for these yards, would go elsewhere, and deprive the\r\ncommunity of many comforts, not to say luxuries. They are the means of\r\ncarrying on the import and export trade of this thriving town in a way\r\nthat could not otherwise have been done; famous as this place is for\r\nshipbuilding, spinning, and its splendid sugar-works. These latter you\r\nhave indeed reason to be proud of, for there are few finer. The increase\r\nof importation of sugar is striking. In Britain in 1856, our imports of\r\nthis article were 6,813,000 lbs., in 1865 it was 7,112,772 lbs. Though\r\nall this did not come to Greenock, yet from what you do in this trade, I\r\nthink the word holds good that we as Scotchmen are sweet-toothed. You\r\ncan now boast of a steam communication not only on the coast, but over\r\nthe world. I had last year the pleasure of a cruise in the Trinity yacht\r\n\"Galatea,\" and does not she speak volumes for what can be done by your\r\ncitizens? for that vessel was built by Mr. Caird, and even the ship\r\nseemed to feel that she came from the beautiful Clyde. What a difference\r\nnow to the time of Henry Bell in 1812, who first started a steamer for\r\npassengers on the Clyde! We have now in Great Britain 2523 steamers,\r\nregistering no less than 766,200 tons. Have not these improvements shown\r\nwhat means of communication do for body and mind?\r\n\r\n_Railways_.--Having said this much about steamers, I will turn for a\r\nshort time to another means of communication for body and mind--I mean\r\nthe railways. Are not they a striking advance in science, and the\r\nbringing to bear the power of mind to work on the material that has been\r\nprovided for our use by an all-wise God? It is but a few years since,\r\ncomparatively speaking, they came into existence, and yet, from the time\r\nof George Stephenson (and his perseverance largely aided to perfect the\r\nrailway), see what vast sums of money have been spent, what magnificent\r\nand noble structures have been erected, and what speed has been obtained\r\nfor the communication of body and mind. Instead of the thirty miles from\r\nManchester to Liverpool in 1830, we now have in Great Britain and\r\nIreland 13,289 miles of railway. The total capital paid in 1865 was\r\n£455,478,000, and this has largely increased since then. An idea may be\r\nformed of the difference of the rate of speed in travelling effected,\r\nboth before and after the introduction of railways, by such facts as the\r\nfollowing:--Two hundred years ago, King James's groom rode six days in\r\nsuccession between London and York, and a wonderful feat it was deemed;\r\nwhilst now, the same distance is performed in five hours. About 1755 to\r\n1760, the London and Edinburgh coach was advertised to run between these\r\ncities in fourteen days in summer, and sixteen in winter, resting one\r\nSunday on the road. So much for the growing desire for speedy\r\nintercourse for mind and body.\r\n\r\n_Suez Canal_.--There is an all-absorbing topic now before the public,\r\nand it is one that brings strikingly before us the thirst for\r\ncommunication of both body and mind to and from distant parts of our\r\nglobe. It is one of deep importance to all who take an interest in the\r\nadvancement of science--I mean the Suez Canal. The Red Sea cannot but be\r\nfamiliar to us all--a sea of the most profound interest, for there did\r\nthe mighty Jehovah work one of His most stupendous miracles, when He\r\nbrought the children of Israel out of Egypt, and at the same time\r\ndestroyed Pharaoh and all his host. But in how different a manner did\r\nthe Lord work! By a word He caused the waters to go back, leaving a wall\r\non the right hand and on the left, so that the people of Israel went\r\nthrough on dry land. This was not all. Were not His chosen people\r\naccompanied by a pillar of fire to give light in the night season, and a\r\ncloud of thick darkness to prevent the Egyptians coming near them during\r\nthe day? Does not this show that His mercy is over all His works? For\r\nafter He had brought out His people with joy, and His chosen with\r\ngladness, He overthrew their enemies in the sea--in the same place where\r\nHe had performed such wonders for the preservation of His people.\r\n\r\nOften has the spot been crossed by our steamers; and though some may,\r\nand I trust do, bring to mind the stupendous miracle, yet it, like many\r\nother thing's, is regarded as a matter gone by. Here now we have the Red\r\nSea brought under our notice in a most striking manner, and one that\r\nleads us not only to feel the greatness of the power of man over\r\nmaterial things, but I trust it may also lead us to see our littleness\r\nwhen compared with Him who made us. We, that is the nations which\r\nbrought about this great canal, have had to spend years and vast sums of\r\nmoney to carry out the end aimed at, and under the Divine aid it has\r\nbeen brought to a successful termination. But see what God did! Did the\r\nAlmighty consult engineers, or take soundings and levels, or ask the\r\nlaws of Nature if He could or would succeed? Nay,--one word was enough.\r\nHe spake, and that was sufficient--the waters stood up in a heap. We,\r\nhowever, have succeeded in bringing the Red Sea and the Mediterranean\r\ninto connection with each other--an achievement that strongly shows the\r\ndetermination of man. It is a boon, indeed, to the commerce of this\r\ncountry, and I hope also of many others, as by enabling ships to pass\r\nthrough, the transhipment of cargo is now done away with, and the\r\ndistance to the other side of the globe reduced to its minimum.\r\nEngineers may truly be proud of the day that brought this great and\r\nnoble work to a completion; and I trust they will thank the Lord who\r\nhath crowned their strenuous efforts with success.\r\n\r\n_Books_.--Having got thus far as regards the conveyance of the body, we\r\nmust now turn to the communication of the mind, and the thoughts of one\r\nindividual as conveyed to another, and this leads one to speak of books.\r\nWhat are they but the means of communication of the thoughts of great\r\nmen, and a distribution of those thoughts for the benefit of their\r\nfellows, by bringing before them matters of interest in the history of\r\nour own country and that of others. The great object to be looked to is\r\nthe selection of our books--the variety is now so great; and I grieve to\r\nsay (and I think I am right) that the sensational works of the present\r\nday have a tendency to lead the mind into a train of thought that is\r\nflippant and unsteady, and I would warn young people against them. When\r\nwe look to such works as those of Sir Walter Scott, Macaulay, and many\r\nothers of the same kind, we find food for the mind, the benefit of which\r\ncannot be over-estimated.\r\n\r\n_Printing_.--The spread of knowledge through the world is indeed a boon\r\nwhich cannot be too highly extolled; but the thoughts of man could not\r\nthus have been circulated had it not been for the printing-press. See\r\nwhat science and art have done for us in this most perfect and beautiful\r\nmachine! When we go only to one example, the \"Times\" newspaper, and\r\nconsider the amount of information it circulates each day through the\r\nworld, it strikes one forcibly what man has been allowed and enabled to\r\ndo for the benefit of himself and his fellow-men. What we have brought\r\nthe printing-press to, is shown in 20,000 copies of the \"Times\" being\r\nthrown off in one hour, and the advantage it has been to the advancement\r\nof literature in our now being able to buy such works as those of Sir\r\nWalter Scott for sixpence a volume.\r\n\r\nHaving gone so far, I must not detain you for more than a brief period.\r\nYou have had such an able and interesting course of lectures given by\r\nmen of high talent, that little remains for me except to close this\r\ncourse with congratulation to the Association in being able to procure\r\nthose individuals to give their valuable time to this desirable object;\r\nfor what in life is more interesting than the imparting the knowledge we\r\nmay possess to others who desire to acquire it, seeing that there is no\r\nway in which moral and social intercourse is more advanced and\r\ndeveloped. Still, before closing, I must ask for a short time to go into\r\none or two other subjects. And first, I will take one of the greatest\r\nimportance to the commerce of this country, and one that has shown what\r\nthe mind has done for communicating the thoughts of one person to\r\nanother at far distant places--I refer to the telegraph. The land is\r\nnot only covered with wires, but even the vast depths of the great ocean\r\nare made to minister to our requirements. The world, we may say, is\r\nencircled with ropes, and instant communication has been the result.\r\nWhat has achieved these great results but the mind of man applied to\r\nscience! And see in what a multitude of ways this application of mind\r\nhas been made to work! What does it bring into play? Why, we have mining\r\nto produce the metal to make the wire; we have the furnace, hammers, and\r\nwire-drawing machines to produce the wire from the raw material. We have\r\nthe forest then to go to for gutta-percha, for land poles, and for tar\r\nto preserve the cables. We have the farmer for our hemp. We have the\r\nchemist, we have the electrician, we have the steamer, and a great\r\nnumber of other requisites before the silent but unerring voice of the\r\nneedle brings the thoughts of one man in America to another in this town\r\nin an instant of time. Accidents and mistakes will occur in the\r\nbest-regulated works of all kinds, but I hope not often. One as to the\r\ntelegraph I must tell that happened during the Indian Mutiny. The\r\nmessage meant to say that \"The general won't act, and the troops have no\r\nhead.\" The transformation was curious, namely, \"The general won't eat,\r\nand the troops have cut off his head.\" If men would only consider well\r\nthis grand achievement, they would be led indeed to say and feel, with\r\nall humility and thankfulness, that God has truly given him dominion\r\nover the works of His hands, and has put all things in subjection under\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgotten one other point of communication for mind, and,\r\nthough at the risk of trying your patience, I must mention it, as its\r\nincrease has been so large, and its advantages so manifold and untold. I\r\nmean the penny-postage. I am not going to enter into it at any length,\r\nbut the increase of correspondence has been so large, that Sir Rowland\r\nHill's name should not be left out of a lecture treating on subjects\r\nsuch as this one is intended to do. I will content myself by merely\r\ntelling the increase of correspondence, and leave you to judge for\r\nyourselves as to its benefits. The number of letters in 1839, before the\r\npenny-postage, was 82,470,596, and in 1866 it was 597,277,616. Judge the\r\ndifference!\r\n\r\nComing to the results of communication, I have one subject to bring\r\nbefore you, and as it has shown to such a large extent the benefits of\r\ninternational communication, I trust a few words on it may not be out\r\nof place. The subject is the great International Exhibitions that have\r\nbeen held in various countries in the last eighteen years. The first\r\nidea of holding such great exhibitions emanated from a man whose name\r\ncannot be held in too great estimation by all. Few men were gifted with\r\nsuch rare talents as he was, for there were few subjects, whether in\r\nscience, literature, or art, that he was not intimately acquainted with.\r\nThis man was the late Prince Consort. He conceived the idea that if the\r\nproducts of the various countries of the world could be brought together\r\nunder one roof, the knowledge these would convey of the machinery,\r\ncultivation, science, literature, and arts practised in the various\r\nparts of the globe would tend to stimulate and advance the mind by\r\nshowing that we had not only ourselves to look to, but that in a great\r\nmeasure we had to depend on others for the many blessings we now enjoy;\r\nand also lead us to see how needful to our prosperity and comfort is a\r\nconstant communication with those who can communicate to us that\r\nknowledge which otherwise we could not obtain. Certainly the results\r\nhave proved that he was right. Could anything have been more\r\ninteresting or instructive to all than a visit to the Great Exhibitions\r\nof 1851 or 1862, or that of Paris in 1867. The public interest is at\r\nonce shown when I tell you that 6,039,195 persons visited the latter,\r\nand the receipts in money were £506,100. There, all and every one had\r\nbefore him at a glance the subject most suited to his taste, with a full\r\ndescription of the country which produced it. From the largest machine,\r\nthe heaviest ordnance, the most brilliant and precious stones, the\r\nfinest silks, lace, furniture, carriages, the greatest luxuries for the\r\ntable, and, in fact, everything needful for the use of man;--all were\r\nthere, and all to be seen and studied by the inquiring mind, or to be\r\nregarded as very wonderful by those who went to the Exhibition as a\r\nsight. Few, I venture to say, ever left these buildings except wiser\r\nthan when they entered. It could not fail to strike one, if one only\r\ngave it a moment's reflection, and asked himself, how has all this been\r\nbrought about, but that it was the result of the communication of the\r\nminds of certain individuals with those of others, and by a\r\nconcentration of the products of various countries to enlighten the\r\nmind as to the vast intelligence of the world at large.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I feel now that I have spoken long enough for any\r\nlecture, though I have not by any means exhausted the subject of\r\ncommunication of either past or present; but I should feel grieved if I\r\nexhausted your patience. All things, as we well know, must have an end,\r\nexcept that life to which we are looking forward and striving to gain,\r\nwhere we shall cease from our labours and be at rest. We have been\r\nendued by our Maker with thought and mind, talents to be used for our\r\nbenefit, and not wrapped up in a napkin till our Lord's return, but to\r\nbe placed out so as to bring in either the five or the ten talents. And,\r\nas you all know, we are answerable for the manner in which we employ\r\nthem. May the result prove that we have used them aright.\r\n\r\nThe progress of means of communication of mind and body have been\r\ngradual but steady, and I think may be represented by human life from\r\nits childhood to manhood, as beautifully set forth in the 13th chapter\r\nof 1st Corinthians 11th verse, where it is said, \"When I was a child, I\r\nspake as a child; I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but\r\nwhen I became a man, I put away childish things.\" Is not this very much\r\nin keeping with our growth in communication? At first it was small, and\r\nwe were content to hear of what others were engaged in without regard to\r\ntime, as one day earlier or later was of little consequence. But now we\r\nare not children, but are become men in our interests and thirst for\r\ncommunication with each other. What should we say if we found the\r\nExpress, as was written on the boy's post-bag, busily engaged in a game\r\nof bowls on the road, regardless of the loss of time or money thereby\r\noccasioned? I think we should be inclined to write to the papers.\r\n\r\nThe results of communication are manifold, and day by day they are\r\nbrought before us in a manner which shows the untiring wish of man for\r\nimprovement both in social and commercial interests. These results are\r\nstrikingly shown in the various subjects I have endeavoured to bring\r\nbefore you. Each and all of them are subjects for thought. What should\r\nwe now be without, I may say, any one of them?\r\n\r\nA well-regulated mind is the most desirable of all acquirements, and I\r\nknow no better means of gaining this than by meetings of such\r\ninstitutions as this. Here you have intercourse with your friends, and\r\nyou can gain from one another by friendly intercourse stores of\r\nknowledge, that to search for as individuals would take away much more\r\ntime than you could by any means devote, and at the same time attend to\r\nthe business of your calling. Here you have the means of amusement as\r\nwell as of gaining sound information, and I trust no one here will ever\r\nhave cause to regret the day when he came to associate with his friends,\r\nand hear what others could communicate, for \"in the multitude of\r\ncounsellors there is wisdom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STEAM-ENGINE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe many varieties of the world's manufactures--one might almost call\r\nthem wonders--are now so numerous, that to bring any particular one in a\r\nsingle form before this meeting is a matter of no easy nature. To-night,\r\nhowever, I have ventured to single out, and have the pleasure of\r\nbringing before you, the steam-engine, as the prime mover at present of\r\nour workshops and manufactories, as also the grand motive power of our\r\nrailways, now so different from the time when the great Stephenson was\r\nsaid to be mad, because he thought it possible to drive a train at\r\nfifteen miles an hour. For the first serviceable use of this grand\r\nmachine we are indebted to the great James Watt. He it was who first\r\nwrought it so as to be under the useful and entire control of man, from\r\nwhat it was in the time of Hero of Alexandria, about 120 years before\r\nChrist. Our engineers have, since Watt's time, improved upon it year by\r\nyear, till at the present day, instead of having to go in a mail-coach\r\nfrom London to Edinburgh, which formerly took fifty hours, we now go in\r\nthe express train in ten, a distance of 420 miles. If beyond this ten\r\nhours, we grumble, and ask guards, porters, &c., at the various\r\nstations, \"What has made the train so late to-day?\" forgetting that just\r\nbefore the railways were first opened, the great Stephenson was urged\r\nnot to say too much as to the supposed power of the locomotive, in case\r\nthe cause of railways might be damaged. This was only some forty years\r\nago, and it shows us how times are changed, for in the present day we\r\nconsider thirty miles an hour anything but a fast train.\r\n\r\nThe history of the steam-engine is a subject on which so much has been\r\nwritten in books and magazines now before the public, that what I am\r\nabout to offer, though pretending nothing new, yet I hope may be looked\r\nupon as containing something useful as well as instructive, both to the\r\npractical and the amateur mechanic. I shall therefore, in as small a\r\ncompass as possible, trace the steam-engine from its first and early\r\nstages up to its present perfect state as our grand motive power. The\r\nfirst mention made of the vapour of water, as formed by the action of\r\nheat upon it, is found to be as far back as 120 B.C., when one Hero of\r\nAlexandria employed this vapour for the purpose of driving a machine. It\r\nis a well-known fact that when water is brought up to a certain degree\r\nof heat, called the boiling-point, that it sends forth a vapour, the\r\nelastic properties of which, when in an open vessel, are not\r\nperceived--as, for instance, in a common pan--yet if the vessel is\r\nclosed or shut up at the top, you will find that the vapour acquires\r\nsuch a degree of elastic force, that, if not allowed to escape by fair\r\nmeans, it would soon make a way or vent for itself by bursting whatever\r\nvessel it was contained in. Steam is thus highly elastic, but when\r\nseparated from the fluid out of which it is generated, it does not\r\npossess a greater elastic force than the same quantity of air. If, for\r\nexample, a vessel is filled with steam only at 212°, it may be brought\r\nto a red heat without fear of bursting; but if water is also in the\r\nvessel, each additional quantity of heat causes a fresh quantity of\r\nsteam to be generated, which adds its elastic force to that of the steam\r\nalready in the vessel, till the constantly accumulating force at last\r\nbursts the vessel.\r\n\r\nThis elastic vapour is called steam, and it is by this that that most\r\nbeautiful machine, the steam-engine, is driven. As you all know, by this\r\nvapour or air--for it is invisible till it loses part of its\r\nheat--enormous power is obtained in a small compass, and the labour of\r\nman reduced to nothing compared with former ages. Many men laboured to\r\nperfect machinery to be worked by this vapour of water, and many came\r\nnear the mark; but it remained for the great Watt, at the Soho Works,\r\nBirmingham, to bring the engine to its useful and working state, for\r\nthough discovered as a motive power 120 B.C., it was yet reserved for\r\nthis truly great man to be what may be termed the inventor of the\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\nIn 120 B.C., Hero of Alexandria made a machine to be driven by steam. It\r\nconsisted of a hollow sphere into which the steam was admitted;\r\nprojecting from the sphere were two arms, from which the steam escaped\r\nby three holes on the side of _each_ arm opposite to that of the\r\ndirection of its revolution, which, by removing the power from off the\r\none part of _each_ arm, caused it to revolve in the direction opposite\r\nto that of the hole that allowed the steam to escape. This kind of\r\nengine has been for some years in use by Mr. Ruthven of Edinburgh. There\r\nare others who have followed very closely on Hero's plan in more ways\r\nthan one; for instance, it is the common Barker's mill, though with this\r\ndifference, that his mill is driven by water instead of steam: Avery,\r\nalso, made a steam-engine almost exactly the same. I may here, perhaps,\r\njust be allowed to mention what a little water and coal will produce, as\r\nit will show at once from whence our power is derived. \"A pint of water\r\nmay be evaporated by two ounces of coal; in its evaporation it swells to\r\n216 gallons of steam, with a mechanical force equal to raising a weight\r\nof thirty-seven tons one foot high.\" A pound of coal in a locomotive\r\nwill evaporate about five pints of water, and in their evaporation these\r\nwill exert a force equal to drawing two tons on a railway a distance of\r\none mile in two minutes. A train of eighty tons weight will take 240\r\npassengers and luggage from Liverpool to Birmingham and back, each\r\njourney about four and a quarter hours; this double journey of 190 miles\r\nbeing effected by the combustion of one and a half tons of coke, worth\r\nabout twenty-four shillings. To perform the same work by common road\r\nwould require twenty coaches, and an establishment of 3800 horses, with\r\nwhich the journey would be performed each way in about twelve hours,\r\nstoppages included. So much for the advantages of steam.\r\n\r\nThe Romans are supposed to have had some knowledge of the power of\r\nsteam. Among amusing anecdotes, showing the knowledge the ancients had\r\nof steam, it is told that Anthemius, the architect of Saint Sophia,\r\nlived next door to Zeno. There existed a feud between them, and to annoy\r\nhis neighbour, Anthemius had some boilers placed in his house containing\r\nwater, with a flexible tube which he could pass through a hole in the\r\nwall under the floor of Zeno's dwelling; he then lit a fire, which soon\r\ncaused steam to pass through the tube in such a quantity as to make the\r\nfloors to heave as if by an earthquake. But to return. We next come to\r\nBlasco de Garay (A.D. 1543), who proposed to propel a ship by the power\r\nof steam. So much cold water seems to have been thrown on his engine,\r\nthat it must have condensed all his steam, as little notice is taken of\r\nit except that he got no encouragement. We find that it has also been\r\nused by some of the ancients in connection with their deities.\r\nRusterich, one of the Teutonic gods, which was found in an excavation,\r\nproves how the priests deceived the people. The head of this one was\r\nmade of metal and contained a pot of water. The mouth and another hole\r\nin the forehead being stopped by wooden plugs, a fire of charcoal was\r\nlighted under this pot of water, and at length the steam drove out the\r\nplugs with a great noise, and the god was shrouded in a mist of steam\r\nwhich concealed him from his astonished worshippers.\r\n\r\nIn 1629, Giovanni Branca of Loretto in Italy, an engineer and architect,\r\nproposed to work mills and other machinery by steam blowing against\r\nvanes, much in the same way as water does in turning a wheel. The waste\r\nof steam in such a plan is so obvious, that it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat it did not produce any great results, as we all know that the\r\nmoment we let steam out of his case, the case is all up with him, and he\r\ndies a natural death. He is a most delicate yet powerful agent, and\r\nrequires to be kept warm in all weathers--this fact does not seem to\r\nhave struck Mons. Branca when he let him out of his boiler.\r\n\r\nThe next person we come to, and perhaps the first of any note, is the\r\nMarquis of Worcester in 1663 (died 1667). He was a man who seems, as far\r\nas history tells us, to have taken a great interest in furthering the\r\nadvancement of steam. He was not contented with one invention, but\r\npublished a book entitled \"A Century of Inventions,\" and in this work he\r\ndescribes a means of raising water by the pressure of steam. The Marquis\r\nappears to have been a politician as well as an inventor, as we find he\r\nwas engaged on the side of the Royalists in the Civil Wars of the\r\nRevolution, lost his fortune and went to Ireland, where he was\r\nimprisoned. Escaping to France, from thence he returned to London as a\r\nsecret agent of Charles II., but was detected and imprisoned in the\r\nTower, where he remained till the Restoration, when he was set at\r\nliberty. One day, while in prison, he observed the lid of the pot in\r\nwhich his dinner was being prepared lifted up by the vapour of the water\r\nboiling inside. Reflecting on this, he turned his mind to the matter,\r\nand thought that this vapour, if rightly applied, might be made a useful\r\nmoving power. He thus describes his invention in his 68th Article: \"I\r\nhave contrived an admirable way to drive up water by fire, not by\r\ndrawing or sucking it upwards, thirty-two feet. But this way hath no\r\nbounds, if the vessels be strong enough.\" He then goes on to say, that\r\n\"having a way to make his vessels, so that they are strengthened by the\r\nforce within, I have seen the water run like a constant stream forty\r\nfeet high. One vessel rarified by fire driveth forty of cold water, and\r\none being consumed, another begins to force, and refill with cold water,\r\nand so on successively, the fire being kept constant. The engineman\r\nhaving only to turn two cocks, so as to connect the steam with the one\r\nor the other vessel.\"\r\n\r\nIn this engine, if it can be called an engine, we see that the Marquis\r\nhad a good idea of the power of steam, but he had none, you will\r\nobserve, as to the action of the condensation which would immediately\r\ntake place when the steam from the boiler was brought into contact with\r\nthe cold water to be raised. Therefore this plan would be most\r\nexpensive, on account of the great loss of steam by condensation. It\r\nwas, however, quite able to produce the effect, though only equal to\r\nraising 20 cubic feet of water, or 1250 lbs., one foot high by one pound\r\nof coal, or about the two-hundredth part of the effect of a good\r\nsteam-engine. After this, of course, it proved of no avail; but still we\r\nmay say that the Marquis of Worcester was among the first who tried to\r\nmake, and did do so, steam a moving power.\r\n\r\nOur next is Denys Papin (died 1710), a native of Blois, in France, who\r\nwas mathematical professor at Marpurg. To him is due the discovery of\r\none of the qualities of steam--its condensation, so as to produce a\r\nvacuum, to the proper management of which our modern engines owe much of\r\ntheir efficacy. Papin seems to have been the first who conserved the\r\nidea of the cylinder and piston, which he made to act on atmospheric\r\nprinciples--that is to say, he took a cylinder with a piston moving up\r\nand down in it, and found that by removing the air from under the piston\r\nin the cylinder, that the pressure of the atmosphere would drive it down\r\nto the bottom of the cylinder: this he performed by admitting steam, and\r\nthen condensing it rapidly, so causing the required vacuum. The pressure\r\nof the atmosphere is as near as may be 16 lbs. on every square inch of\r\nsurface on the globe: this is obviously the weight of the columns of\r\nair extending from that square inch of surface upwards to the top of the\r\natmosphere. This force is thus measured: Take a glass tube 32 inches\r\nlong, open at one end and closed at the other; provide also a basin full\r\nof mercury; let the tube be filled with mercury and inverted into the\r\nbasin. The mercury will then fall in the tube, till it gets to that\r\nheight which the atmosphere will sustain. This is nothing more than the\r\nbarometer used in all our houses. If the action of the tube be equal to\r\na square inch, the weight of the column of mercury in the tube would be\r\nexactly equal to the weight of the atmosphere on each square inch of\r\nsurface. Thus Papin discovered a great step in the steam-engine, though\r\nit was not much acted on for some years; he was also the first who\r\nproposed to drive ships with paddles worked by steam.\r\n\r\nWe now come to Thomas Savory, who got a patent in 1698 for a method of\r\ncondensing steam to form a vacuum. Savory describes his discovery in\r\nthis way:--Having drank a flask of wine at a tavern, he flung the empty\r\nflask on the fire, and then called for a basin of water to wash his\r\nhands. A little wine remained in the flask, which of course soon\r\nboiled, and it occurred to him to try what effect would be produced by\r\nputting the mouth of the flask into the cold water. He did this, and in\r\na moment the cold water rushed up and filled the flask, this being\r\ncaused by the steam being condensed and leaving a vacuum, which Nature\r\nabhors, and rather than permit this the water rushed up and took the\r\nplace formerly occupied by the now condensed steam. We see by this in\r\nhow simple a way great ends are produced, and in the age in which this\r\nhappened, the result may be indeed be said to have produced a great end.\r\nThe engine of Savory was used for some years as a machine to raise\r\nwater. The principle of his engine was just as I have stated, and\r\nconsisted of two cases and other various parts, and this engine\r\npossessed advantages over that of the Marquis of Worcester in sucking up\r\nthe water as well as forcing.\r\n\r\nSavory's engine consisted of two steam vessels connected to a boiler by\r\ntubes; a suction pipe, or that pipe which leads from a pump of the\r\npresent day to the well, and communicating with each of the steam\r\nvessels by valves opening upwards; a pipe going from these steam vessels\r\nto any required height to which the water is to be raised. The steam\r\nvessels were connected to this pipe by other valves, also opening\r\nupwards, and by pipes. Over the steam vessels was placed a cistern,\r\nwhich was kept filled with _cold_ water. From this proceeded a pipe with\r\na stopcock. This cistern was termed the condensing cistern, and the pipe\r\ncould be brought over each steam vessel alternately from the boiler.\r\nNow, suppose the tubes to be filled with common air, and the regulator\r\nplaced so that one tube and the boiler are made to communicate, and the\r\nother tube and the boiler closed, steam will fill one of the steam\r\nvessels through one tube; at first it will condense quickly, but erelong\r\nthe heat of the steam will impart its heat to the metal of the vessel,\r\nand it will cease to condense. Mixed with the heated air, it will\r\nacquire a greater force than the air outside the valve, which it will\r\nforce open, and drive out the mixture of air and steam, till all the air\r\nwill have passed from the vessel, and nothing but the vapour of water\r\nremain. This done, a cock is opened, and the water from the cistern is\r\nallowed to flow over the outside of the steam vessel, first having\r\nstopped the further supply of steam from it; this produced the\r\nimmediate condensation of the steam contained in it, by the temperature\r\nbeing brought down again by the cold water, and the condensation thus\r\nproduced caused a vacuum inside the vessel. The valve will then be kept\r\nclosed by the atmosphere outside, and the pressure of the air on the\r\nsurface of the water in the well or reservoir will open another valve,\r\nforce the water up the pipe, till, after one or two exhaustions--if I\r\nmay so term it--it will at last reach the second vessel. Thus far the\r\natmosphere has done all the work, but at last the water fills the\r\nvessel, and then comes the forcing point. Now the power of the steam\r\nitself is used to drive the water up the pipe. The steam is again let\r\ninto the vessel, now filled in whole, or at least in great part, with\r\nwater; at first it will, as before, condense rapidly, but soon the\r\nsurface of the water will get heated, and as hot water is lighter than\r\ncold, it will keep on the surface, and the pressure of the steam from\r\nthe boiler will drive all the water from the vessel up the pipe. When it\r\nis empty the cock is again opened, and the steam, which the vessel by\r\nthis time only contains, is again condensed, and the same process which\r\nI have just described is again commenced and carried out, thus making\r\nSavory's engine a complete pump by the aid of the vapour of water as\r\nraised by fire.\r\n\r\nSavory had the honour of showing this engine to His Majesty William III.\r\nat Hampton Court Palace, and to the Royal Society. He proposed the\r\nfollowing uses, which perhaps may as well be mentioned, as they show how\r\nlittle was then known of the real value of the power of steam:--1. To\r\nraise water to drive mill-wheels--fancy erecting a steam engine now, of\r\nsay fifty horse-power, to raise water to turn a wheel of say thirty; 2.\r\nTo supply palaces and houses with water; 3. Towns with water; 4.\r\nDraining marshes; 5. Ships; 6. Draining mines. There is one more thing I\r\nmay mention as curious, that though the steam he used must have been of\r\na high pressure, he did not use a safety-valve, though it had been\r\ninvented about the year 1681 by Papin. The consumption of fuel was\r\nenormous in Savory's engine, as may easily be perceived from the great\r\nloss of steam by condensation. Nevertheless, it was on the whole a good\r\nand a workable engine, as we find the following said of it by Mr.\r\nFarey:--\"When comparison is made between Captain Savory's engine and\r\nthose of his predecessors, the result will be favourable to him as an\r\ninventor and practical engineer. All the details of his invention are\r\nmade out in a masterly style, so as to make it a real workable engine.\r\nHis predecessors, the Marquis of Worcester, Sir S. Morland, Papin, and\r\nothers, only produced outlines which required to be filled up to make\r\nthem workable.\"\r\n\r\nI must not detain you much longer before I proceed to the great Watt,\r\nbut I will just name Newcomen, who invented an engine with a cylinder,\r\nand introduced a beam, to the other end of which he fixed a pump rod\r\nlike a common or garden pump. He made the weight of the pump and beam to\r\nlift the piston, and then let the steam enter below the piston and\r\ncondensed it by a jet of water, thus causing a vacuum, when the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere drove the piston from the top to the bottom of the\r\ncylinder and lifted the pump rods in the usual way. There were various\r\ncocks to be opened and shut in the working of this engine for the right\r\nadmission of steam and water at the required moments, a task which was\r\nperformed by boys who were termed cock-boys. I will now mention an\r\ninstance which, though in practice not to be imitated, yet was one of\r\nthose happy accidents which sometimes turn out for the best. One of\r\nthese boys, like many, more fond of play than work, got tired of turning\r\nthese cocks day by day, and conceived the idea of making the engine do\r\nit for itself. This idle boy--we will not call him good-for-nothing, as\r\nhe proved good for a great deal in one way--was named Humphrey Potter,\r\nand one day he fixed strings to the beam, which opened and shut the\r\nvalves, and so allowed him to play, little thinking this was one of the\r\ngreatest boons he could possibly have bestowed on the world at large,\r\nfor by so doing he rendered the steam-engine a self-acting machine.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a period which was destined to advance the cause of steam\r\nto a far greater extent--in fact, the time which rendered the\r\nsteam-engine the useful and valuable machine it now is. This is the time\r\nof James Watt. This great man, be it said to the credit of Scotland, was\r\nborn in Greenock, on the Clyde, on the 19th January 1736. His\r\ngrandfather was a farmer in Aberdeenshire, and was killed in one of the\r\nbattles of Montrose. His father was a teacher of mathematics, and was\r\nlatterly chief magistrate of Greenock. James Watt, the celebrated man of\r\nwhom I now speak, was a very delicate boy, so much so, that he had to\r\nleave school on account of his health, and was allowed to amuse himself\r\nas he liked. This he did in a scientific way, however, as an aunt of his\r\nsaid to him one day: \"Do you know what you have been doing? You have\r\ntaken off and put on the lid of the teapot repeatedly; you have been\r\nholding spoons and saucers over the steam, and trying to catch the drops\r\nof water formed on them by it. Is it not a shame so to waste your time?\"\r\nMrs. Muirhead, his aunt, was little aware that this was the first\r\nexperiment in the way which afterwards immortalised her nephew.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 Watt was sent to London to a mathematical instrument maker, but\r\ncould not stay on account of his health, and soon afterwards came back\r\nto Glasgow. He then got rooms in the College, and was made mathematical\r\ninstrument maker to the University, and he afterwards opened a shop in\r\nthe town. He was but twenty-one years of age when he was appointed to\r\nthis post in the College, and his shop became the lounge of the clever\r\nand the scientific. The first time that his attention was directed to\r\nthe agency of steam as a power was in 1734, when a friend of his, Mr.\r\nRobinson, who had some idea of steam carriages, consulted him on the\r\nsubject,--little is said of this, however. In 1762 Watt tried some\r\nexperiments on high-pressure steam, and made a model to show how motion\r\ncould be obtained from that power; but did not pursue his experiments on\r\naccount of the supposed danger of such pressure. He next had a model of\r\nNewcomen's engine, which would not work well, sent him to repair. Watt\r\nsoon found out its faults, and made it work as it should do. This did\r\nnot satisfy him, and setting his active mind to work, he found in the\r\nmodel that the steam which raised the piston had of course to be got rid\r\nof. This, as a natural consequence, caused great loss of heat, as the\r\ncylinder had to be cooled so as to condense the steam; and this led him\r\nat last, after various plans, to adopt a separate vessel to condense\r\nthis steam. Of course, if you wish to save fuel, it is necessary that\r\nthe steam should enter a heated cylinder or other vessel, or else all\r\nthe steam is lost,--or in other words, condensed,--that enters it, until\r\nit has from its own heat imparted so much to the cylinder as to raise\r\nit to its own temperature, when it will no longer condense, and not till\r\nthen does it begin to exert its elastic power to produce motion. This\r\nwas the great object gained by James Watt, when, after various\r\nexperiments, he gave up the idea altogether of condensing steam in its\r\nown or working cylinder, and then made use of a separate vessel, now\r\ncalled the condenser.\r\n\r\nThe weight of steam is about 1800 times less than water. I may here\r\nperhaps mention also that water will boil at 100 degrees Fahr. in vacuo,\r\nwhereas in atmosphere it takes 212 degrees to boil. There is also a\r\nthing perhaps worth knowing to all who wish to get the most stock out of\r\nbones, &c., that if they are boiled in a closed vessel, that is to say,\r\nunder a pressure of steam, a very large increase in quantity of the\r\nstock will be produced, because the heat is increased. A cubic inch of\r\nwater, evaporated under _ordinary_ atmospheric pressure, will be\r\nconverted into a cubic foot of steam; and a cubic inch of water,\r\nevaporated as above, gives a mechanical force equal to raising about a\r\nton a foot high.\r\n\r\nThe next great improvement of Watt, in addition to the condenser, is the\r\nair-pump, the use and absolute necessity for which you will understand\r\nwhen I explain its action. Watt first used it for his atmospheric\r\nengine. The piston of this engine was kept tight by a flow of oil and\r\nwater on the top, which tended to make the whole a troublesome and\r\nbad-working machine. The cold atmosphere, as the piston went down, of\r\ncourse followed it and cooled the cylinder. On the piston again rising,\r\nsome steam would of course be condensed and cause waste. If the\r\nengine-room could be kept at the heat of boiling water, this would not\r\nhave been the case, but the engineman who could live in this heat would\r\nalso require to be invented, and so this had to be given up. Watt's next\r\nand most important step was the one which brings us to talk of the\r\nsteam-engine as it now is in the present day. This important step was\r\nthe idea, of making the steam draw down the piston, as well as help to\r\ndrive it up; in the first engines it was raised by the beam, and steam\r\nused only to cause a vacuum, so as to let the air drive it down. All\r\nbefore this had been merely steps in advance, like those of children,\r\nwho must walk before they can run; so was it with the steam-engine. It\r\nwas uphill work for many years, and the top of the hill cannot be said\r\nto have been readied till Watt worked out this grand idea. The first\r\nengine could only be called atmospheric; now it was destined to become\r\nin reality a steam-engine. Time would fail were I to attempt to go into\r\nany details of all the experiments through which Watt toiled to bring\r\nhis ideas to perfection--enough to say that he did so; and I trust you\r\nwill be able, through the description I will endeavour to give, to\r\nunderstand how well his labour was bestowed, and how beautiful the\r\nresult has proved for the benefit of the world at large. In 1773, Watt\r\nremoved to Soho, near Birmingham, where a part of the works was allotted\r\nto him to erect the machinery necessary to carry out his inventions on a\r\ngrand scale.\r\n\r\nWe must now proceed to some of the useful points of the engine, all I\r\nhave before mentioned simply relating to the inventors and improvers;\r\nbut having brought it so far, I may now, I think, proceed further. The\r\nfirst use of the steam-engine was simply to raise water from mines, and\r\nfor long it was thought it could be used for nothing else; so much so,\r\nthat it was at one time used to raise water to turn wheels and thus\r\nproduce motion. One of its first uses after it became a really useful\r\nmachine was to propel ships, though many a weary hour was spent to bring\r\nit to this point. There is a very pretty monument on the Clyde,\r\ndedicated to Mr. Bell, who I believe was the first person who\r\nsuccessfully brought steamers to work on its waters. The first who used\r\nsteam for ships was Mr. James Taylor, in conjunction with Mr. Miller of\r\nDalswinton. The danger of the fire-ship took such hold on people's minds\r\nthat it was with great toil and difficulty they were persuaded to\r\nventure on the face of the waters in such dangerous and unseamanlike\r\ncraft. But go to Glasgow Bridge any day, and you will see how time has\r\novercome fear and prejudice, for our ocean is covered with steamers of\r\nall sizes. It is not many years ago since it was said that steamers\r\ncould never reach America; this has given way to proof, and even\r\nAustralia has been reached by steam. I know of a steamer building which\r\ncould carry the whole population of this place and not be full; she is\r\n680 feet or 226 yards long, and a large vessel would hang like a boat\r\nalongside her.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at giving motion by steam to ships was of course only\r\nin one way--by a ratchet at the end of a beam, at one moment driving\r\nand the next standing still. This was on account of the engine being\r\nonly in power one half of the stroke; but by the double-acting engine\r\nbeing introduced, and the steam acting both ways, it became at last a\r\nsteady mover (without the aid of two or three cylinders, as in the first\r\nengines, one to take up the other as the power was given off), by a\r\nratchet on the end of a beam or else a chain. This acted on the shaft\r\nwhich moved the paddles. It is to Watt that we are indebted for the\r\ncrank and direct action, so as to give a circular motion to the wheels.\r\n\r\nWe find in 1752 a Mr. Champion of Bristol applied the atmospheric engine\r\nto raise water to drive a number of wheels for working machinery in a\r\nbrasswork, in other words, a foundry. Also, in Colebrokedale,\r\nsteam-engines were used to raise water that had passed over the wheel,\r\nso as to save water. All these plans have, however, now passed by, like\r\nthe water over the wheel, and we now have the engine the prime\r\nmover--the double action of the steam on the piston, this acting on the\r\nsway beam, and the beam on the crank, which, by the assistance of the\r\nfly-wheel on land or fixed engines, gives a uniform motion to the\r\nmachine. All these have now enabled us to apply the engine as our grand\r\nmoving power. One great and important point in the engine is the\r\ngovernor, and the first modes of changing the steam from the top to the\r\nbottom of the cylinder were cumbrous, till the excentric wheel was\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nBoilers also have to be attended to--these were at first rude and now\r\nwould be useless. They were unprovided with valves, gauge-cocks, or any\r\nother safety, all of which are now so well understood that nothing but\r\ncarelessness can cause a blow-up. One of the greatest causes of danger\r\nis that of letting there be too little water in the boiler, and thus\r\nallowing it to get red-hot, when, if you let in water, such a volume of\r\nsteam is generated that no valve will let it escape fast enough. Force\r\nor feed pumps are also required to keep the water in the boiler at a\r\nproper height, which is ascertained by the gauge-cocks. Mercury gauges\r\nfor low pressure act according to the pressure of the atmosphere;\r\nhigh-pressure boilers of course require a different construction, as the\r\nsteam is greater in pressure than the air.\r\n\r\nHaving got so far in my subject, I think before concluding I must devote\r\na short time in showing the first steps of the locomotive; the more so,\r\nas I am speaking to those who are so largely engaged in the daily\r\nworking of that now beautifully perfect machine. Various and for a time\r\nunsuccessful experiments were made to bring out a machinery or\r\ntravelling engine, as it was first called. A patent was taken by a Mr.\r\nTrevethick for a locomotive to run on common roads, and to a certain\r\nextent it did work. An amusing anecdote is told of it. In coming up to a\r\ntoll-gate, the gatekeeper, almost frightened out of his seven senses,\r\nopened the gate wide for the monster, as he thought, and on being asked\r\nwhat was to pay, said \"Na-na-na-na!\" \"What have we got to pay?\" was\r\nagain asked. \"No-noth-nothing to pay, my dear Mr. Devil; do drive on as\r\nfast as you can!\" This, one of the first steam carriages, reached London\r\nin safety, and was exhibited in the square where the large station of\r\nthe London and North-Western Railway now stands. Sir Humphrey Davy took\r\ngreat interest in it, and, in writing to a friend, said: \"I shall hope\r\nsoon to see English roads the haunts of Captain Trevethick's dragons.\"\r\nThe badness of roads, however, prevented its coming into general use.\r\n\r\nTrevethick in 1804 constructed a locomotive for the Merthyr and Tydvil\r\nRail in South Wales, which succeeded in drawing ten tons at five miles\r\nan hour. The boiler was of cast-iron, with a one-cylinder engine, spur\r\ngear and a fly-wheel on one side. He sent the waste steam into the\r\nchimney, and by this means was very nearly arriving at the blast-pipe,\r\nafterwards the great and important discovery of George Stephenson. The\r\njumping motion on the bad roads, however, caused it constantly to be\r\ndismounted, and it was given up as a practical failure, being sent to\r\nwork a large pump at a mine. Trevethick was satisfied with a few\r\nexperiments, and then gave it up for what he thought more profitable\r\nspeculations, and no further advances were made in locomotives for some\r\nyears. An imaginary difficulty seems to have been among the obstacles to\r\nits progress. This was the supposition that if a heavy weight were to be\r\ndrawn, the grip or bite of the wheels would not be sufficient, but that\r\nthey would turn round and leave the engines stationary, hence Trevethick\r\nmade his wheels with cogs, which of course tended to cause great jolts,\r\nas well as being destructive to the cast-iron rails.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Blenkinsop of Leeds patented in 1811 a locomotive with a racked or\r\ntoothed rail. It was supported on four wheels, but they did not drive\r\nthe engine; its two cylinders were connected to one wheel behind, which\r\nwas toothed and worked in the cog-rail, and so drove the engine. It\r\nbegan running on Middleton Coal Rail to Leeds, three and a quarter\r\nmiles, on the 12th August 1812, and continued a great curiosity to\r\nstrangers for some years. In 1816 the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia saw\r\nthis engine working with great interest and expressions of no slight\r\nadmiration. An engine then took thirty coal-waggons at three and a\r\nquarter miles in an hour.\r\n\r\nWe next come to Messrs. Chapman of Newcastle, who in 1812 tried to\r\novercome the supposed want of adhesion by a chain fixed at the ends of\r\nthe line and wound round a grooved drum driven by the engine. It was\r\ntried on the Heaton Rail near Newcastle, but was found to be so clumsy\r\nthat it was soon abandoned. The next was a remarkable contrivance--a\r\nmechanical traveller to go on legs. It never got beyond its experimental\r\nstate, and unfortunately blew up, killing several people. All these\r\nplans show how lively an interest was then being taken in endeavouring\r\nto bring out a good working locomotive. Mr. Blackett, however,\r\npersevered hard to perfect a railway system, and to work it by\r\nlocomotives. The Wylam waggon-way, one of the oldest in the North, was\r\nmade of wooden rails down to 1807, and went to the shipping-place for\r\ncoals on the Tyne. Each chaldron-waggon was originally drawn by a horse\r\nwith a man in charge, only making two journeys in the one day and three\r\non the following, the man being allowed sevenpence for each journey.\r\nThis primitive railway passed before the cottage where George Stephenson\r\nwas born, and was consequently one of the first sights his infant eyes\r\nbeheld; and little did his parents think what their child was destined\r\nto work out in his day for the advancement of railways. Mr. Blackett\r\ntook up the wood and laid an iron plate-way in 1808, and in 1812 he\r\nordered an engine on Trevetbick's principle. It was a very awkward one,\r\nhad only one cylinder of six inches diameter, with a fly-wheel; the\r\nboiler was cast-iron, and was described by the man who had charge of it\r\nas having lots of pumps, cog-wheels, and plugs. It was placed on a\r\nwooden frame with four wheels, and had a barrel of water on another\r\ncarriage to serve as a tender. It was at last got on the road, but\r\nwould not move an inch, and her driver says:--\"She flew all to pieces,\r\nand it was the biggest wonder we were not all blown up.\" Mr. Blackett\r\npersevered, and had another engine, which did its work much better,\r\nthough it often broke down, till at length the workmen declared it a\r\nperfect plague. A good story is told of this engine by a traveller, who,\r\nnot knowing of its existence, said, after an encounter with the\r\nNewcastle monster working its great piston, like a huge arm, up and\r\ndown, and throwing out smoke and fire, that he had just \"encountered a\r\nterrible deevil on the Hight Street road.\"\r\n\r\nWe now come to George Stephenson, who did for the locomotive what Watt\r\ndid for our other steam-engines. His first engine had two vertical\r\ncylinders of eight inches diameter and two-feet stroke, working by\r\ncross-heads; the power was given off by spur-wheels; it had no springs,\r\nconsequently it jolted very much on the then bad railways; the wheels\r\nwere all smooth, as Stephenson was sure the adhesion would be\r\nsufficient. It began work on the 25th July 1814, went up a gradient of\r\none in 450, and took eight waggons with 30 tons at four miles an hour.\r\nIt was by far the most successful engine that had yet been made. The\r\nnext and most valuable improvement of Stephenson was the blast-pipe--by\r\nits means the slow combustion of the fire was at once overcome, and\r\nsteam obtained to any amount. This pipe was the result of careful\r\nobservation and great thought. His next engine had horizontal connecting\r\nrods, and was the type of the present perfect machine. This truly great\r\nman did not rest here, but time would fail, as well as your patience, if\r\nI were to proceed further. Enough to say, that he afterwards established\r\na manufactory at Newcastle, and time has shown the result and benefit it\r\nhas proved to the whole world at large. A short time before the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway was opened, Stephenson was laughed at\r\nbecause he said he thought he could go thirty miles an hour, and was\r\nurged before the House of Commons not to say so, as he might be thought\r\nto be mad. This I have from person who knew the circumstances.\r\nNevertheless, at the trial, I believe the \"Rocket\" did go at the rate of\r\nthirty miles an hour, to the not small astonishment of the world, and\r\nespecially to the unbelievers in steam as a land agent. The stipulation\r\nmade was that trains were to be conveyed at the rate of twelve miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nIn our present perfect engines, the coke or fuel consumed per mile is\r\nabout 18 lbs. with a train of 100 tons gross weight, carrying 250\r\npassengers. A first-class carriage weighs 6 tons 10 cwts.; a\r\nsecond-class, 5 tons 10 cwts., each with passengers; a Pullman car\r\nweighs about 30 tons. Our steamers consume 5 lbs. of coal per\r\nhorse-power in one hour. And last, not least, one of the greatest\r\nimprovements we have had in steam propulsion is the screw. Again, I may\r\nalso name the great advantage derived from steam by our farmers in\r\nthrashing out grain. The engines principally used in farm-work are what\r\nare termed high-pressure, or of the same class as the locomotive. The\r\ngreat saving in cost in the first place, the simplicity and ease of\r\naction in the second, and the small quantity of water required to keep\r\nthem in action, are all reasons why they should be preferred. The danger\r\nin the one, that is, the high-pressure, over the condenser, is very\r\nsmall, and all that is required is common care to guard against\r\naccidents. Steam being a steady power, is much to be preferred to\r\nwater, as by its constant and uniform action the tear and wear of\r\nmachinery is much diminished, and of course proportionate saving made in\r\nkeeping up the mill or any other machinery.\r\n\r\nHaving now, to the best of my power, so far as a single lecture will\r\npermit, brought the steam-engine from 120 B.C. to the present time, it\r\nonly remains for me to say, that it shows how actively the mind of man\r\nhas been permitted to work to bring it to perfection by the direction of\r\nan all-wise Providence, \"who knows our necessities before we ask, and\r\nour ignorance in asking.\" A traveller by rail sees but little of the\r\nvast and difficult character of the works over which he is carried with\r\nsuch ease and comfort. Time is his great object. No age of the world has\r\nconquered such difficulties as our engineers have had to deal with, and\r\nthe result is now before the eye of every thinking traveller. Our\r\nengineers were at first self-taught, and many a self-taught man has had\r\nreason to rejoice in the time he spent in his education. Of these men we\r\nhave examples in Brindley, who was at first a labourer and afterwards a\r\nmillwright; Telford was a stone-mason; Rennie a farmer's son apprenticed\r\nto a millwright; and George Stephenson was a brakesman at a colliery.\r\nPerseverance with genius, and a determination to overcome, made them the\r\ngreat men they were. That you may so persevere and strive is the earnest\r\nwish of him who has this evening had the great pleasure of giving you\r\nthis lecture, and who feels so greatly obliged to you for the very\r\npatient hearing you have given him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ON ATTRACTION_.[B]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gravitation_.--Attraction, which may be illustrated by the effect a\r\nmagnet has on a piece of iron, may be viewed generally as an influence\r\nwhich two bodies, say, exert on each other, under which, though at a\r\ndistance, they tend to move towards each other till they come into\r\ncontact. The force by which a body has weight, and, when free, falls to\r\nthe ground, is of this nature; and it is called, from _gravis_, \"heavy,\"\r\nthe gravitating force of the earth, because it causes weight, and\r\nbecause, though emanating in a small degree from the falling body, it is\r\nmainly exerted by the earth itself. It is under the action of gravity\r\nthat a pendulum oscillates: it is by that unseen influence it begins to\r\nsway alternately downward and upward as soon as it is moved to a side;\r\nand it is only because it is withheld by the rod that the ball or bob\r\nkeeps traversing the arc of a circle and does not fall straight to the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAll material substances, however small, and however light, buoyant, and\r\nethereal they may seem, are subject to this force: the tiniest speck in\r\na sunbeam and the most volatile vapour, equally with the heaviest metal\r\nand the hugest block, the particles of bodies as well as the bodies\r\nthemselves. The rising of a balloon in the air may seem an exception to\r\nthis law; but it is not so; for the balloon rises, not because the\r\nparticles of the gas with which it is inflated are not acted upon by the\r\nearth's attraction, but because the air outside being bulk for bulk\r\nheavier than the air inside, its particles press in below the balloon\r\nand buoy it up, until it reaches a stratum of the atmosphere where, the\r\npressure being less, the air outside is no heavier than the air\r\nwithin--a fact which rather proves than disproves the universal action\r\nof gravitation; because the greater weight of the air in the lower\r\nstrata of the atmosphere is due to the pressure of the air in those\r\nabove, and the balloon ceases to ascend because it has reached a point\r\nwhere the air outside is the same weight as the air within, and the\r\nweight in both cases is caused by the attraction of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd not only is the force of attraction universal, it is the same for\r\nevery particle; for though this may seem to be contradicted by the fact\r\nthat some bodies fall faster to the ground than others, that fact is\r\nfully accounted for by the greater resistance which the air offers to\r\nthe falling of lighter bodies than to the falling of heavier. A\r\nparticles of bodies, and all bodies, tend to fall with the same\r\nvelocity, and, in fact, all do; for though, for the reason just stated,\r\na feather will take longer to reach the ground than an ounce of lead, an\r\nounce of lead will fall as fast as a hundredweight. And that it is the\r\nresistance of the air, and not any diminution in the power of\r\nattraction, which causes the feather to lag behind, may be proved by\r\nexperiment; for if you let a feather and a coin drop together from the\r\ntop of the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, they will both be seen to\r\ndescend at the same rate, and reach the bottom at the same instant; a\r\nfact which may be demonstrated more simply by placing the coin and\r\nfeather free of each other in a paper cone, and letting the cone fall\r\nwith its apex downwards, so as to break the air's resistance; or by\r\nsuspending a piece of gold-leaf in a bottle, and letting the bottle\r\ndrop--of course short of the ground--in which case the included leaf\r\nwill be seen to have gone as fast and as far as the bottle.\r\n\r\nIt is to be especially noticed that attraction is no lopsided affair;\r\nthat it is mutual; that, while the larger body attracts the less, the\r\nless also attracts and moves the larger in proportion; and that, indeed,\r\nevery body and every particle attracts every other, far as well as near,\r\nto the utmost verge of the universe of matter. Under it the moon\r\nmaintains its place with reference to the earth, the planets with\r\nreference to the sun, and the solar system with reference to the\r\nstellar. As for the moon, it maintains its orbit and revolves round the\r\nearth under the action of two forces, the one akin to that by which a\r\nball is projected from the mouth of a cannon, and the other the\r\nattraction of the earth, which, by its constant and equal operation,\r\nbends its otherwise rectilineal track into a circular one, as we might\r\nshow if we could only project a ball with such a force as exactly to\r\nbalance the power of gravity, so that it would at no point in its course\r\nbe drawn nearer the earth than at starting.\r\n\r\nThat the force we are considering pervades the solar system is\r\ndemonstrable, for it is on the supposition of it and the laws it is\r\nknown to obey that all the calculations of astronomy--and they never\r\nmiscarry--are grounded; and it is by noticing disturbances in the\r\notherwise regular movements of certain planets that astronomers have\r\nbeen led more than once to infer and discover the presence of some\r\nhitherto unknown body in the neighbourhood. It was actually thus the\r\nplanet Neptune was discovered in 1846. Certain irregularities had been\r\nobserved in the movements of Uranus, which could not be accounted for by\r\nthe influence of any other bodies known to be near it; and these\r\nirregularities, being carefully watched and studied, gradually led more\r\nthan one astronomer first to the whereabouts, and then to the vision of\r\nthe disturbing planet.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding what we said about the universality of this force, and\r\nhow it affects all forms of matter, it may still appear as if the air\r\nwere an exception. But it is not so; the air also gravitates. The fact\r\nthat it gravitates is proved in various ways. First, if it did not, it\r\nwould not accompany the earth in its movements round the sun; the earth\r\nwould sweep along into space, and leave it behind it. Secondly, if we\r\nplace a bottle from which the air is exhausted in a balance and exactly\r\npoise it with a counter-weight, and then open it and let in the air, it\r\nwill show at once that the air has weight or gravitates by immediately\r\ndescending. Thirdly, if we extend a piece of india-rubber over the end\r\nof a vessel and begin to withdraw the air from it, we shall see the\r\nindia-rubber sink in, under the pressure of the air outside, to fill up\r\nthe space left vacant by the removal of the included air. The fact that\r\nair gravitates we have already taken for granted in explaining the\r\nascent of a balloon; and the proofs now given are enough to show that\r\nthe cause assumed is a real one. The lighter gas rises and the heavier\r\nsinks by law of gravitation.\r\n\r\n_Gravitation and Cohesion._--Unlike the attraction of aggregation, or\r\ncohesion, which acts only between particles separated from each other\r\nby spaces that are imperceptible, gravitation takes effect at distances\r\nwhich transcend conception, but it diminishes in force as the distance\r\nincreases. The law according to which it does so is expressed thus; its\r\nintensity decreases with the square of the distance; that is to say, at\r\ntwice the original distance it is 1-4th; at thrice, 1-9th; at four\r\ntimes, 1-16th, for 4, 9, 16 are the squares respectively of 2, 3, and 4.\r\nTo take an instance, a ball which weighs 144 lb. at the surface of the\r\nearth will weigh 1-4th of that, or 36 lb., when it is twice as far from\r\nthe centre as it is at the surface; and 1-9th, or 16 lb. when it is\r\nthrice as far; and 1-16th, or 9 lb. when it is four times as far. The\r\nattraction of cohesion, on the other hand, as we say, acts only when the\r\nparticles seem almost in contact, and it ceases altogether when once, by\r\nmechanical or other means, the bond is broken, in consequence of the\r\nparticles being forced too near, or sundered too far from, one another.\r\n\r\nOne distinguishing difference between the attraction of gravitation and\r\nthat of cohesion is, that whereas the former is uniform, the latter is\r\nvariable; that is, under gravitation the attraction of any one particle\r\nto any other is the same, but under cohesion, some sets of particles\r\nare more forcibly drawn together than others. For instance, a particle\r\nof iron and a particle of cork gravitate equally, but particles of iron\r\nand particles of cork among themselves do not cohere equally. And it is\r\njust because those of the former cohere more than those of the latter,\r\nthat a piece of iron feels harder and weighs heavier than a piece of\r\ncork.\r\n\r\nFurther, the attraction of gravitation is unaffected by change in the\r\ncondition of bodies, while that of cohesion is. It makes nothing to\r\ngravitation whether a piece of metal is as cold as ice, or heated with a\r\nsevenfold heat. Not so to the power of cohesion; withdraw heat, and the\r\nparticles under cohesion cling closer; add it, and both the spaces grow\r\nwider and the attraction feebler. Thus, for example, you may suspend a\r\nweight by a piece of copper-wire, and the wire not break. But apply heat\r\nto the wire, and its cohesion will be lessened; the force of gravitation\r\nwill overpower it, rupture the wire, and cause the weight to fall.\r\n\r\n_Cohesion_.--That the action of the attraction of cohesion depends on\r\nthe contiguity of the particles in the cohering body, may be shown by\r\nan illustration. Take a ball of lead, divide it into two hemispheres,\r\nsmooth the surfaces of section, then press them together, and you will\r\nfind it requires some force to separate them; thus proving the\r\ndependence of cohesion on contiguity, although the effect in this case\r\nmay be due in some degree to the pressure of the atmosphere as well as\r\nthe power of cohesion.\r\n\r\nHeat is the principal agent in inducing cohesion, as well as in relaxing\r\nits energy; for by means of it you can weld the hardest as well as the\r\nsoftest substances into one, and two pieces of iron together, no less\r\nthan two pieces of wax. It is possible, indeed, by heat to unite two\r\nsufficient waxed corks to one another, so as to be able by means of the\r\none to draw the other out of a bottle: such, in this case, is the force\r\nof cohesion induced by heat.\r\n\r\nThe power of cohesion exists between the particles of liquids as well as\r\nthose of solids, the only difference being that in solids the particles\r\nare relatively fixed, while in liquids they move freely about one\r\nanother, unless indeed when they are attracted to the surface of a\r\nsolid--a fact we are familiar with when we dip our finger into a vessel\r\nof water. The cohesive power of liquids is overcome by heat as well as\r\nthat of solids, only to a much greater degree, for under it they assume\r\na new form, acquire new properties, and expand immensely in volume. They\r\npass into the form of vapour, occupy a thousand times larger area, and\r\npossess an elasticity of compressibility and expansibility they were\r\ndestitute of before.\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful phenomenon which accompanies the expansion of ether\r\nunder the influence of heat. Placed in a flask to which heat is applied,\r\nthe ether will go off in vapour; and as the heat increases, the vapour\r\nwill gradually light up into a lovely flame. The expansibility of air,\r\nwhich is vapour in a permanent form, can be shown by experiment. If we\r\ntie up an empty or collapsed bladder, and place it in a vessel over an\r\nair-pump, we may see, as we withdraw the air from the vessel, and so\r\ndiminish its pressure, the bladder gradually expand and swell as it does\r\nunder inflation.\r\n\r\nThe cohesive power of water is beautifully illustrated. Have a small\r\nbarrel or bucket so constructed as to be fitted with gauze at the top;\r\nimmerse it exactly, so that the water may form a film between the\r\nmeshes, and then open the tap at the bottom: the water will not flow\r\ntill the meshes at the top are broken by blowing on their surface. The\r\nadhesion of the particles in a soap-bubble is another illustration, no\r\nless beautiful, as well as more familiar; for the soap, which might be\r\nsupposed to be the cause of the phenomenon, serves only to prevent the\r\nintrusion of dust between the particles, but by no means to intensify\r\ntheir attractive power.\r\n\r\nThere are some liquids the adhesiveness of whose particles is so perfect\r\nas to bar out the access of air when we strew them on the surface of\r\nother liquids; and on the Continent it is not uncommon to protect wines\r\nagainst the action of the atmosphere by, instead of corking the bottle,\r\nsimply pouring in a few drops of oil, which, being lighter than the\r\nwine, floats on the surface. It is parallel to the instance of the\r\nbarrel with the gauze-wire top mentioned above, that if we loosely plug\r\na bottle full of liquid with a piece of cotton-wool, and invert it, the\r\nparticles in contact with the wool will cohere so closely that the fluid\r\nwill not be able to escape. The adhesiveness of the particles of water\r\nto a solid surface can be exemplified by allowing one of the scales of a\r\nbalance to float in water and leaving the other free; the one in\r\ncontact with the water will refuse to yield after we have placed even a\r\ntolerable weight in the other which is suspended in the air.\r\n\r\nThe power of cohesion is more rigorous in some bodies than others. In\r\nsome cases the body will rupture if it is interfered with ever so\r\nlittle; in others, the particles admit of a certain displacement, and if\r\nthe limits are not transgressed, they return to their original position\r\nwhen the compressing or distending cause is removed. This rallying power\r\nin the cohesive force is called Elasticity, and it exists in no small\r\ndegree in glass. The spaces between the particles can, within limits, be\r\neither lessened by compression or increased by distension, and the\r\nparticles retain their power of recovering and maintaining the relation\r\nthey stood in before they were disturbed. It is the power of cohesion or\r\naggregation which resists any disturbance among the particles, and which\r\nrestores order among them when once disturbance has taken place. And not\r\nonly does nature resist directly any undue interference with the\r\ncohering force, but tampering with it even slightly has often a certain\r\ndeteriorating effect upon the physical properties of bodies. A bell,\r\nfor instance, loses its tone when heated, because by that means its\r\nparticles are disturbed; though it recovers its tone-power as it cools,\r\nand as the particles return to their places.\r\n\r\nIn organic bodies, both during growth and decay, the particles are more\r\nor less in flux; but in feathers, after their formation, the attraction\r\nof aggregation remains constant, and by means of it their particles\r\ncontinue fixed in their places, not only with the life of the bird, but\r\nlong after. Nay, you may even crumple them up, and toss them away as\r\nworthless, and yet if you expose them to the vapour of steam, they will\r\nnot only recover their form, but they can be made to look as beautiful\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Affinity_.--The attraction of the particles of bodies of\r\ndifferent kinds to each other is often striking and curious; as, for\r\ninstance, those of salt to those of water. The salt attracts the water,\r\nand the water the salt, till at last, if there is a sufficient quantity\r\nof water, all the salt is attracted particle by particle from itself,\r\nand taken up and united to the water. The salt is no longer visible to\r\nthe eye, and is said to be dissolved or in solution; but this change of\r\nform is due to its affinity for the water, and the resulting attraction\r\nof the one to the other. The same phenomena are observed, and they are\r\ndue to the same cause, in other solutions; as when we infuse our tea or\r\nsweeten it with sugar. The attraction of water, or one of its elements\r\nrather, for other substances, sometimes shows itself in vehement forms.\r\nWhen a piece of potassium, for example, is thrown into a vessel of\r\nwater, its attraction for the water is such, and of the water for it,\r\nthat it instantly takes fire, and the two blaze away, particle violently\r\nseizing on particle until the elements of the water unite part for part\r\nwith the metal. It is the mutually attractive force that causes the heat\r\nand flame which accompany the combination; and this force is most\r\nviolently active in the union of dissimilar substances. Unions of a\r\nquieter kind, though not less thorough, occur even between solids when\r\nplaced in contact. For instance, sulphate of soda and sulphate of\r\nammonia, when placed side by side, will diliquesce, and in liquid form\r\nunite into a new combination. Sulphuric acid, when we mix it with water,\r\ngenerates great heat; and this is due to its attraction for the water.\r\nSometimes two fluids unite together, and, in doing so, pass from the\r\nliquid into the solid form; as, _e.g._, sulphuric acid and chloride of\r\ncalcium. Attraction of this nature is called chemical: it takes effect\r\nbetween dissimilar particles, and results in combinations with new\r\nproperties. It operates not only between solid and solid, solid and\r\nliquid, and liquid and liquid, but between these and gases, and gases\r\nwith one another; and these as well as those combine into new\r\nsubstances, and evince in the act not a little violent commotion. Thus,\r\nphosphorus catches fire in the atmosphere at a temperature of 140\r\ndegrees, and it goes on rapidly combining with the oxygen, burning with\r\na dazzling white light, and producing phosphoric acid. Indeed, most\r\nmetals have an affinity for the oxygen in the air, and oxydise in it\r\nwith more or less facility; and a metal, as such, has more value than\r\nanother according as it has less affinity for that element, and is less\r\nliable to oxydise or rust in it. This is one reason, among others, why\r\ngold is the most precious metal, and the conventional representative of\r\nhighest worth in things.\r\n\r\nThere are some metals, such as lead, for instance, which oxydise\r\nreadily, but this process stops short at the surface in contact with the\r\nair, and so forms a coating which prevents the metal from further\r\noxydation; so that here, as in so many things else, strength is\r\nconnected with weakness.\r\n\r\n_Electricity_.--This, in the most elementary view of it, is a more or\r\nless attractive or repellant force latent in bodies, and which is\r\ncapable of being roused into action by the application of friction. It\r\nis excited in a rod of glass by rubbing it with silk, and in a piece of\r\nsealing-wax by rubbing it with flannel, though the effect is different\r\nwhen we apply first the one and then the other to the same body. Thus,\r\n_e.g._, if we apply the excited sealing-wax to a paper ring, or a\r\npith-ball, hung by a silk thread from a horizontal glass rod, it will,\r\nafter contact, repel it; and if, thereafter, we apply to it the excited\r\nglass rod, it will attract it; or if we first apply the excited glass\r\nrod to the paper ring, or pith-ball, it will, after contact, repel it;\r\nand if thereafter we apply to it the excited sealing-wax, it will\r\nattract it. The reason is, that when we once charge a body by contact\r\nwith either kind, it repels that kind, and attracts the opposite; if we\r\ncharge it from the glass, _i.e._, with vitreous electricity, it refuses\r\nto have more, and is attracted to the sealing-wax; and if we charge it\r\nfrom the sealing-wax, _i.e._, with resinous electricity, it refuses to\r\nhave more, and is attracted to the glass-rod; only it is to be observed\r\nthat, till the body is charged by either, it has an equal attraction for\r\nboth. From all which it appears that kindred electricities repel, and\r\nopposite attract, each other.\r\n\r\nTwo pieces of gold leaf suspended from a metal rod, inserted at the top\r\nof a glass shade full of perfectly pure, dry air, will separate if we\r\nrub our foot on the carpet, and touch the top of the rod with one of our\r\nfingers; for the motion of the body, as in walking, always excites\r\nelectricity, and it is this which, as it passes through the finger,\r\ncauses the phenomenon; though the least sensation of damp in the glass\r\nwould, by instantly draining off the electricity, defeat the experiment.\r\nWhat happens in this case is, that one kind of electricity passes from\r\nthe finger to the leaves, while another kind, to make room for it,\r\npasses from the leaf to the finger; and the leaves separate because they\r\nare both more or less charged with the same kind of electricity, and\r\nkindred electricities repel each other. Ribbons, particularly of white\r\nsilk, when well washed, are similarly susceptible of electrical\r\nexcitation; and they behave very much as the gold leaf does when they\r\nare rubbed sharply through a piece of flannel. Gutta-percha is another\r\nsubstance which, when similarly treated, is similarly affected.\r\n\r\nThis power is a very mysterious one, and of a nature to perplex even the\r\nphilosophic observer. Certain bodies, such as the metals, convey it, and\r\nare called conductors; certain others, such as glass and porcelain,\r\narrest it, and are called insulators. It is for this reason that the\r\nwires of the telegraph are supported by a non-conductor, for if not, the\r\nelectric current would pass into the earth by the first post and never\r\nreach its final destination. Glass being an insulator, it was found\r\nthat, if a glass bottle was filled with water, and then corked up with a\r\ncork, through which a nail was passed so that the top of it touched the\r\nwater, it would receive and retain a charge as long as it was held in\r\nthe hand; and this observation led to an invention of some account in\r\nthe subsequent applications of electricity, known, from the place of its\r\nconception, as the Leyden jar. This is a glass jar, the inside of which\r\nis coated with tinfoil, and the outside as far as the neck, and into\r\nwhich, so as to touch the inside coating, a brass rod with a knob at\r\nthe top is inserted through a cork, which closes its mouth. By means of\r\nthis, in consequence of the isolation of the coatings by the glass,\r\nelectricity can, in a dry atmosphere, be condensed, and stored up and\r\nhusbanded till wanted.\r\n\r\nA series of eggs, arranged in contact and in line, give occasion to a\r\npretty experiment. In consequence of the shells being non-conductors,\r\nand the inside conducting, it happens that a current of electricity,\r\napplied to the first of the series, will pass from one to another in a\r\nsuccession of crackling sparks, in this way forcing itself through the\r\nobstructing walls. This effect of electricity in making its way through\r\nnon-conducting obstructions accounts for the explosion which ensues when\r\na current of it comes in contact with a quantity of gunpowder; as it\r\nalso does for the fatal consequences which result when, on its way from\r\nthe atmosphere to the earth, it rushes athwart any resisting organic or\r\ninorganic body.\r\n\r\n_Magnetism_.--Unlike electricity, which acts with a shock and then\r\nexpires, magnetism is a constant quantity, and constant in its action;\r\nand it has this singular property, that it can impart itself as a\r\npermanent force to bodies previously without it. Thus, there being\r\nnatural magnets and artificial, we can, by passing a piece of steel over\r\na magnet, turn it into a strong magnet itself; although we can also,\r\nwhen it is in the form of a horse-shoe, by a half turn round and then\r\nrubbing it on the magnet, take away what it has acquired, and bring it\r\nback to its original state. The magnetic property is very readily\r\nimparted (by induction, as it is called) to soft iron, but when the iron\r\nis removed from the magnetising body, it parts with the virtue as fast\r\nas it acquired it. To obtain a substance that will retain the power\r\ninduced, we must make some other election; and hard steel is most\r\nserviceable for conversion into a permanent magnet.\r\n\r\nThe properties of the magnet are best observed in magnetised steel; and\r\nwhen we proceed to test its magnetic power, it will be found that it is\r\nmost active at the extremities of the bar, which are hence called its\r\npoles, and hardly, if at all, at the centre; that while both poles\r\nattract certain substances and repel others, the one always points\r\nnearly north and the other nearly south when the bar is horizontally\r\nsuspended; and that, when we break the bar into two or any number of\r\npieces, however small, each part forms into a complete magnet with its\r\nvirtue active at the poles, which, when suspended, preserves its\r\noriginal direction; so that of two particles one is, in that case,\r\nalways north of the other; nay, it is probable that each of these has\r\nits north pole and its south, as constant as those of the earth itself,\r\nwhich, too, is a large magnet.\r\n\r\nThe magnet acts through media and at a distance, as well as in contact;\r\nand it has an especial attraction for iron, the more so when the\r\nconducting medium is solid, such as a table; and so when the magnet is\r\nhorizontally suspended, or poised, in the vicinity of iron, its tendency\r\nto point north and south is seriously disturbed. The disturbance of the\r\nbar, or needle, in such a case, is called its _deflection_; and it is\r\ncorrected by so placing a piece of soft iron or another magnet in its\r\nneighbourhood as to neutralise the effect, and leave said bar, or\r\nneedle, free to obey the magnetism of the earth. The needle, it is to be\r\nremarked, does not point due north and south, neither, when poised\r\nfreely on its centre, does it lie perfectly horizontal; in our latitude\r\nit points at present 20° west of north, which is called its\r\n_declination_, and its north pole slopes downwards at an angle of 68°,\r\nwhich is called its _dip_.\r\n\r\nBy holding a rod of iron, or a poker, for a length of time parallel to\r\nthe direction of the needle, so as to have the same declination and the\r\nsame dip, it will gradually assume and display magnetic virtue, and this\r\nwill ere long become fixed and powerful under a succession of vibratory\r\nshocks. There is a beautiful experiment in which a needle, when\r\nmagnetised, can be made to float on water, when it adjusts itself to the\r\nmagnetic meridian, and will incline north and south the same as the\r\nneedle of the compass.\r\n\r\n_The Chemical Action of Electricity and Magnetism_.--These agents\r\npossess powers which develop wonderfully in connection with chemical\r\ncombination. Thus, if we suspend a piece of iron in a vessel which\r\ncontains oxygen gas, and apply to the metal an electric current, it will\r\nimmediately begin to unite rapidly, and form an oxide with oxygen,\r\nemitting, during the process, intense heat and a bright flame. Zinc,\r\ntoo, when similarly acted on, will ignite in the common atmosphere and\r\nburn away, though with less intensity, till it also is, under the\r\nelectric force, reduced to an oxide. It is presumed that many other\r\nchemical combinations take place because of the simultaneous joint\r\ndevelopment of electric agencies, as in copper, water, and aquafortis,\r\nnitrate of copper, &c. So also it happens that, when a plate of iron is\r\nfor some time immersed in a copper solution, it comes out at length\r\ncovered over with a coating of copper. And it is because there is\r\nelectricity at work that a silver basin will be coated with copper when\r\nwe pour into it a copper solution, and at the same time place in it a\r\nrod of zinc, so that it rests on the side and bottom, though no coating\r\nwill form at all when there is no rod present to excite the electric\r\ncurrent. The same phenomena will appear if we deposit a silver coin in\r\nthe solution in question: the coin will come out unaffected, unless we\r\nexcite affinity by means of a rod of iron. It is under the action of an\r\nelectric current that one metal is coated with another. The metal,\r\ncopper say, is steeped in a solution of the coating substance, and\r\nconnected by means of wires with a galvanic battery, under the action of\r\nwhich the metal in solution unites with the surface of the plate\r\nimmersed in it. Heat also is developed under magnetic influence, and\r\nthat often of great intensity. Thus, if we connect the poles of a\r\nvoltaic battery by means of a platinum wire, heat will develop to such a\r\ndegree that the platinum will almost instantaneously become red hot and\r\nemit a bright light, and that along a wire of some considerable length.\r\nA similar effect is noticeable when we substitute other metals, such as\r\nsilver or iron, for platinum. And the _electric light_, which flashes\r\nout rays of sunlike brilliance, is the result of placing a piece of\r\ncompact charcoal between the separated but confronting poles of a\r\npowerful galvanic battery, light, developing more at the one pole and\r\nheat more at the other of the incandescent substance.\r\n\r\nKindred, though much milder, results will show themselves under simpler,\r\nthough similar, contrivances. A flounder will jump and jerk about\r\nuneasily if we lay it upon a piece of tinfoil and place over it a thin\r\nplate of zinc, and then connect the two with a bent metal rod; which\r\nwill happen to an eel also, if we expose it to a gentle current from a\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nBy means of electric or magnetic action we can separate bodies\r\nchemically combined, as well as unite them into chemical compounds; as\r\nwill appear if we place a piece of blotting paper upon tinfoil, and this\r\nupon wool; if we then spread above these two pieces of test-paper,\r\nlitmus and turmeric, the one the test of acids, and the other of\r\nalkalis, and saturate both with Glauber salt (which is by itself neither\r\nan acid nor an alkali, but a combination of the two), and, finally,\r\nconnect each by means of a piece of zinc with the poles of a battery,\r\nthe test-papers will immediately change colour, as they do the one in\r\nthe presence of an acid simply, and the other of an alkali simply, but\r\nnever in a compound where these are neutralised; thus proving that the\r\ncompound has in this case been decomposed, and its elements\r\ndisintegrated one from another.\r\n\r\nA very powerful magnet can be produced by coiling a wire round a bar of\r\nsoft iron, and attaching its extremities to the poles of a galvanic\r\nbattery, when it will be found that its strength will be proportioned to\r\nthe strength of the current and the turns of the coil. This is\r\nespecially the case when the bar is bent into the form of a horse-shoe,\r\nand the wires are insulated and coiled round its limbs. The force\r\ncommunicated to a magnet of this kind, which is often immense, is the\r\nproduct of the chemical action which goes on in the battery, and, in a\r\ncertain sense, the measure of it. How great that is we may judge when\r\nwe consider that, evanescent as it is in itself, it has imparted a\r\nvirtue which is both powerful and constant, and ever at our service.\r\n\r\n_Summary_.--Thus, then, on a review of the whole, we find all things are\r\nendowed with attractive power, and that there is no particle which is\r\nnot directly or indirectly related, in manifold ways, to the other\r\nparticles of the universe. There is, first, the universal attraction of\r\ngravitation, under which every particle is, by a fixed law, drawn to\r\nevery other within the sphere of existence. There is, secondly, the\r\nattraction of cohesion or aggregation, which acts at short distances,\r\nand unites the otherwise loose atoms of bodies into coherent masses.\r\nThere is, thirdly, the power by which elements of different kinds\r\ncombine into compounds with new and useful qualities, known by the name\r\nof chemical affinity. And, lastly, related to the action of affinity,\r\naiding in it and resulting from it, there are those strange negative and\r\npositive, attractive and repellant polar forces which appear in the\r\nphenomena of electricity and magnetism, agencies of such potency and\r\nuniversal avail in modern civilisation.\r\n\r\nOn the permanency of such forces and their mutual play the universe\r\nrests, and its wonderful history. With the collapse of any of them it\r\nwould cease to have any more a footing in space, and all its elements\r\nwould rush into instant confusion. What a Hand, therefore, that must be\r\nwhich holds them up, and what a Wisdom which guides their movements!\r\nVerily, He that sends them forth and bids them work His will is greater\r\nthan any one--greater than all of them together. How insignificant,\r\nthen, should we seem before Him who rules them on the wide scale by\r\ncommanding them, while we can only rule them on the small by obeying\r\nthem! And yet how benignant must we regard Him to be who both wields\r\nthem Himself for our benefit and subjects them to our intelligence and\r\ncontrol!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] This paper on \"Attraction\" is the substance of a lecture which I\r\ncomposed on the basis of notes taken by me when. I had the honour of\r\nattending the Prince of Wales at the course given, on the same subject\r\nby the late Professor Faraday. The Professor, having seen the _resumé_ I\r\nhad written, warmly commended the execution, and generously accorded me\r\nhis sanction to make any use of it, whether for the purpose of a lecture\r\nor otherwise, as might seem good to me. It is on the ground of this\r\nsanction I feel warranted to print it here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE OIL FROM LINSEED_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious processes have for a long time been in use for the purpose of\r\nextracting the oils from different species of nuts and seeds, a few of\r\nthe more interesting of which are not unworthy of brief notice and\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon, where cocoa-nuts and oil-producing seeds abound, the means\r\nemployed by the natives in the last century for extracting the oils were\r\nof a most primitive character. A few poles were fixed upright in the\r\nground, two horizontal bars attached to them, between which a bag\r\ncontaining the pulp of the seed or nut was placed. A lever was then\r\napplied to the horizontal bars, which brought them together, thus\r\ncreating a pressure which, by squeezing the bag, gradually expressed the\r\noil from the pulpy substance. This rude machine was at that time of day\r\none of the most approved for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe system of pestle and mortar was also in use, but as the process was\r\nnecessarily very slow, this method was seldom resorted to. An\r\nimprovement on this system was invented by a Mr. Herbert, whose design\r\nit had been to construct a powerful and efficient machine which should\r\ncombine cheapness and simplicity. It consisted of three pieces of wood,\r\nviz., an upright piece fixed in the ground, from the lower and upper\r\nextremities of which there projected the two other pieces, the top one\r\nattached to the joint of a long horizontal lever, and the lower one to\r\nthe joint of a vertical one. The fixed upright post and the horizontal\r\nlever formed the press. The bag of pulp being put between the upright\r\none and the vertical, the pressure was obtained by suspending a negro or\r\na weight from the lever.\r\n\r\nIn another press of the same or a similar kind, the bags were placed in\r\na horizontal frame, and a loose beam of wood pressed down on it by a\r\nlever.\r\n\r\nAnother form of press had cambs and wedges; also a modification of it by\r\nMr. Hall of Dartford, who applied the pressure by means of a\r\nsteam-cylinder. The cambs are arranged alternately, so that one is\r\nfilled while the other is being pressed. This brief notice will suffice\r\nto give an idea of such machines as are wrought by lever pressure.\r\n\r\nWe pass on, therefore, to later inventions and improvements.\r\n\r\nFirst, The Dutch or _stamper_ press, invented in Holland; second, the\r\n_screw_; and, third, the _hydraulic_:--\r\n\r\n(1.) _The stamper press_ is something like a beetling-machine, in which\r\nwedges are driven in between the bags, containing, of course in a\r\nbruised condition, the seed to be pressed.\r\n\r\n(2.) _The screw press_ has an ordinary square-threaded screw, and it\r\nacts in the same way as press for making cider or cheese.\r\n\r\n(3.) _The hydraulic press_. Here the pressure is produced by means of a\r\npiston driven up by the force of water, the immense power of which is,\r\nin great part, due to its almost total incompressibility. This is by far\r\nthe most perfect form of press. Its power must be familiar to all who\r\nremember the lifting of the tubes of the Britannia Bridge, and the\r\n_launching of the Great Eastern_.\r\n\r\nAn oil-mill is in form something like a flour-mill. The operation\r\nbegins at the top, where the seed is passed through a flat screw or\r\nshaker and then through a pair of rollers, which crush it. These rollers\r\nare of unequal diameter, the one being 4 feet, and the other 1 foot; but\r\nthey are both of the same length, 1 foot 4 inches, and make fifty-six\r\nrevolutions in a minute. By this arrangement it is found the seed is\r\nboth better bruised and faster than when, as was formerly the case, the\r\nrollers were of the same diameter. A pair of rollers will crush 4-1/2\r\ntons of seed in eleven hours, a quantity enough to keep two sets of\r\nhydraulic presses going.\r\n\r\nAfter the seed is crushed in this way, it is passed under a pair of edge\r\nstones. These stones weigh about seven tons, are 7 feet 6 inches in\r\ndiameter and 17 inches broad, and make seventeen revolutions a minute.\r\nIf of good quality, they will not require to be faced more than once in\r\nthree years, and they will last from fifteen to twenty. They are fitted\r\nwith two scrapers, one for raking the seed between the stones, the other\r\nfor raking it off at the proper period. One pair of stones will grind\r\nseed sufficient for two double hydraulic presses, and the operation\r\noccupies about twenty-five minutes. The seed is now crushed and ground,\r\nbut before it is passed on to the press it is transferred to the\r\nheating-kettle.\r\n\r\nThe heating-kettle is composed of two cylindrical castings, one fitting\r\nloosely into the other, so that a space is left between them for a free\r\ncirculation of steam all round both the sides and bottom of the interior\r\nvessel. The internal casting is again divided horizontally into two\r\npartitions, one above the other therefore, by two plates, between which\r\nalso there is a space left for the admission and circulation of steam;\r\nand a communication is kept up between the upper compartment and the\r\nunder by means of a stripping valve. Besides this, there is a\r\ncommunication from the internal kettle through the external one, and\r\nalso a shaft passes between the two horizontal parts to give motion to\r\nthe stirrer, which revolves thirty-six times a minute. A cover encloses\r\nthe top, and it is through this the vessel is charged. The upper portion\r\nis filled first, where the contents introduced are allowed to remain ten\r\nor fifteen minutes, after which the valve is opened and the whole falls\r\ninto the lower kettle, where it is kept till wanted. The seed is then\r\ntaken away from the lower kettle by an opening, and bestowed in bags of\r\nsufficient size to make a cake of 8 lbs. weight after the oil is pressed\r\nout of it. Indeed, the compartments of the heating-kettle are of a size\r\nto contain enough to charge one side of a hydraulic press. These,\r\ntherefore, are so constructed as to render the operation continuous, the\r\nupper one being discharged into the under as soon as its contents are\r\nwithdrawn to the press. The seed is heated to the temperature of 170\r\ndegrees Fahr., when it is drawn off and placed in the bags.\r\n\r\nIn another form of kettle the seed is heated on a hot hearth, and on the\r\ntop of the hearth is a loose ring, within which a spindle revolves to\r\nstir the seed. After the requisite temperature has been reached, the\r\nring is raised and the seed swept into the bags, which are made of\r\nhorse-hair. There is great loss of heat in this method, however, as the\r\nseed is exposed to the atmosphere, which of course cools it.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the final operation, the mode of expressing the oil. The\r\nscrew press we do not need to describe, as it consists simply of two\r\nplates, brought together by a screw, in the same way as the press used\r\nfor squeezing apples in the manufacture of cider, and the cheese press.\r\nLet us look therefore at the stamper press. It consists of an iron box,\r\nopen at the top, at each end of which are two plates, capable of\r\ncontaining between them a bag of seed which shall yield a cake weighing\r\n9 lbs. To one of the inner plates of the box is attached a wedge, beside\r\nwhich is inserted another filling up, and then the driving wedge is\r\nintroduced; and lastly, another block is let in between this wedge and\r\nthe other plate as soon as the bags have been placed vertically in the\r\npress-box. A stamper of wood, worked by cambs on a revolving shaft, is\r\nallowed to fall about 1 foot 10 inches, at the rate of fifteen strokes a\r\nminute, for about six minutes. This stamper is 16 feet long by 8 inches\r\nsquare, and falls on the head of the wedge, and drives it in to a level\r\nat the top of the box. Another stamper is employed to drive down an\r\ninverted wedge, so as to release the working one, and enable the\r\nattendant to take out the cake. A press of this kind will turn out only\r\nabout 12 cwts. of cake a day.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the hydraulic press. This is certainly the most approved\r\ninvention that has yet been adopted, and it is simply a Bramah press\r\nadjusted for the purpose. It has been in use for about thirty years,\r\nthough it was, of course, at first less skilfully and scientifically\r\nconstructed than it is now. In one of the earliest of these presses, the\r\nbox which contains the seed runs on a tramway in order to facilitate its\r\nremoval from the heating-kettle, so that each time the bags have to be\r\nreplenished the whole box has to be removed; and this causes no\r\ninconsiderable loss both of power and time, for it has, when filled, to\r\nbe replaced on the ram and lifted bodily upwards in order to bring it\r\nflush with the top of the press, which fits the press-box and acts as a\r\npoint of resistance. In this arrangement there are introduced only one\r\npress and one set of small pumps.\r\n\r\nThe next press we come to is Blundell's, which is admitted to be by far\r\nthe most efficient in use to-day. Here there are two distinct presses,\r\nor a double hydraulic press, fed by two pumps, one 2-1/2 inches and the\r\nother 1 inch in diameter, both connected with the separate cylinders by\r\nhydraulic tubing. The stroke of these pumps is 5 inches, and they make\r\nthirty-six strokes a minute. The larger pump is weighted to 740 lbs. on\r\nthe square inch, and the smaller to 5540 the square inch. The diameter\r\nof the rams is 12 inches, and the stroke 10 inches. Each press is fitted\r\nto receive four bags of seed, and it produces 64 lbs. of cake at each\r\noperation. After the heated seed has been placed in the bags, the\r\nattendant proceeds to fill one press, and then he opens the valve\r\nbetween the large pump and the charged press, which causes the ram to\r\nrise till there is a pressure of forty tons, whereupon the safety-valve\r\nof the large pump opens, and is kept so by a spring. While this\r\noperation is going on, the attendant is occupied with filling the second\r\npress; which completed, he opens the communication between the large\r\npump and the second press, taking care first to replace the\r\nsafety-valve. The ram of this press is then raised to the same height as\r\nthe other, after which the safety-valve rises a second time. The\r\nattendant, as he closes the valve which opens the communication between\r\nthe large pump and the press, at the same time opens the valve between\r\nthe small pumps and the presses; and the pressure, amounting to about\r\n300 tons, exerted by the small pump, is allowed to remain on the rams\r\nfor about seven minutes. From which it appears that, allowing three\r\nminutes for emptying and charging the press, the process of expressing\r\nthe oil takes only three minutes in all; and it is done by this press in\r\nthis brief time in the most effectual manner. The oil, as it is\r\nexpressed, passes through the canvas and hair bags to a cistern, known\r\nas the spill-tank, which is just large enough to contain the produce of\r\none day's working. The presses are worked by oil instead of water, as it\r\nkeeps both presses and pumps in better order. Each of them will produce\r\n36 cwts. of cake per day of eleven hours, while the yield of oil is\r\nabout 14 cwts. The oil is pumped from the spill-tanks to larger ones,\r\ncapable of holding from 25 to 100 tons, where it remains for some time\r\nin order to settle previously to being brought to the market.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to enter into the relative merits of the various\r\npresses, but content myself with having explained to you the manner in\r\nwhich the oil is produced.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, it may be interesting to give you some idea of the\r\nvast extent of this manufacture. It appears, according to the official\r\nreturns, that in the year 1841 we imported 364,000 quarters of seed.\r\n\r\nTHE OIL FROM LINSEED.\r\n\r\n   ______________________________________________________\r\n   | 1842 | 368,000 | 1847 | 439,000 | 1852 |   800,000 |\r\n   | 1843 | 470,000 | 1848 | 799,000 | 1853 | 1,000,000 |\r\n   | 1844 | 616,000 | 1849 | 626,000 | 1854 |   828,000 |\r\n   | 1845 | 666,000 | 1850 | 668,000 | 1855 |   757,000 |\r\n   | 1846 | 506,000 | 1851 | 630,000 | 1856 | 1,100,000 |\r\n   ______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nNow if we take the last year's imports, we shall find that the produce\r\nwould amount to about 144,000 tons' weight of oil-cake, and above 56,000\r\ntons of oil.\r\n\r\nThe cake is used for feeding cattle, and the oil for burning,\r\nlubricating, painting, &c.; and a very large quantity is exported.\r\n\r\nWe find that to crush the seed imported in 1856 it required from 150 to\r\n160 double hydraulic presses, nearly 100 of which were in Hull. This\r\nshows the extent of our commerce in the seed of flax, to say nothing of\r\nits fibre; and is one more instance of the great results which may be\r\nwrought out of little things. What a beautiful illustration of the\r\nbounty of Providence; and what an encouragement to the ingenuity of man!\r\nWho knows what treasures may yet lie hidden in neglected fields, or to\r\nwhat untold wealth the human family may one day fall heir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_HODGE-PODGE: OR, WHAT'S INTILT._\r\n\r\nWRITTEN NOV. 20, 1875, AT STAGENHOE PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject and treatment, as well as title, of this Lecture are\r\nsuggested by the answer of the hostess at a Scottish inn to an English\r\ntourist, who was inquisitive to know the composition of a dish which she\r\noffered him, and which she called Hodge-Podge. \"There's water intilt,\"\r\nshe said, \"there's mutton intilt, there's pease intilt, there's leeks\r\nintilt, there's neeps intilt, and sometimes somethings else intilt.\" The\r\nanalysis was an exhaustive one, and the intelligence displayed by the\r\nlandlady was every way worthy of the shrewdness indigenous to her\r\ncountry; but her answer was not so lucid to her listener as to herself,\r\nas appeared by his bewildered looks, and his further half-despairing\r\ninterrogatory. \"But what is _intilt_?\" said he, impatiently striking in\r\nbefore she had well finished. \"Haven't I been tellin' ye what's\r\nintilt?\" she replied. And she began the enumeration again, only with\r\nlonger pause and greater emphasis at every step, as if she were\r\nenlightening a slow apprehension,--\"There's water intilt, there's mutton\r\nintilt;\" quietly and self-complacently adding, as she finished, \"Ye\r\nsurely ken now what's intilt.\" Whether her guest now understood her\r\nmeaning, or whether he had to succumb, contented with his ignorance, we\r\nare not informed; but few of my readers need to be told that \"intilt\" is\r\na Scotch provincialism for \"into it,\" and that the landlady meant by\r\nusing it to signify that the particulars enumerated entered as\r\nconstituents _into_ her mysterious dish.\r\n\r\nMy aim is to discourse on the same constituents as they display their\r\nvirtues and play their parts on a larger scale, in a wider economy; and\r\nwhen I have said my say, I hope I may be able to lay claim to the credit\r\nof having spoken intelligibly and profitably, though I must at the\r\noutset bespeak indulgence by promise of nothing more than the serving up\r\nof a dish of simple hodge-podge. The question I put in a wider reference\r\nis the question of the Englishman, as expressed in the Scotchwoman's\r\ndialect, What's intilt? and I assume that there enter into it, as\r\nradically component parts, at least the ingredients of this motley soup.\r\nInto the large hodge-podge of nature and terrestrial economics, as into\r\nthis small section of Scotch cookery, there enter the element of water,\r\nthe flesh of animals, and the fruits of the earth, as well as the\r\nprocesses by which these are brought to hand and rendered serviceable to\r\nlife. The ingredients of hodge-podge exist in _rerum natura_, and the\r\nplace they occupy and the function they fulfil in it are no less\r\ndeserving of our inquisitive regard.\r\n\r\nThus, there is water in it, without which there were no seas and no\r\nsailing of ships, no rivers and no plying of mills, no vapour and no\r\npower of steam, no manufacture and no trade, and not only no motion, but\r\nno growth and no life. There is mutton, or beef, in it, and connected\r\ntherewith the breeding and rearing of cattle, the production of wool,\r\ntallow, and leather, and the related manufactures and crafts. There are\r\nturnips and carrots in it, the latter of such value to the farmer that\r\non one occasion a single crop of them sufficed to clear off a rent; and\r\nthe former of such consequence in the fattening of stock and the\r\nprovision of animal food, that a living economist divides society\r\nexhaustively into turnip-producing classes and turnip-consuming. There\r\nare leeks and onions in it, and these, with the former, suggest the art\r\nof the gardener, and the wonderful processes by which harsh and fibrous\r\nproducts can be turned into pulpy and edible fruits. And there are pease\r\nand barley in it, and associated therewith the whole art of the\r\nhusbandman in the tillage of the soil and the raising of cereals, with\r\nthe related processes of grinding the meal, baking the bread, preparing\r\nthe malt, brewing the beer, and distilling the fiery life-blood at the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nNow, to discourse on all these, as they deserve, would be a task of no\r\nordinary magnitude, but the subject is an interesting one, and to treat\r\nof it ever so cursorily might not unprofitably occupy a reflective\r\nmoment or two. Water is the first topic it is laid upon me to talk\r\nabout, and I begin with it all the more readily because it suggests a\r\nsense of freshness, and thoughts which may float our enterprise\r\nprosperously into port.\r\n\r\nI. Water, as already hinted, is an element of vast account in the\r\neconomy of nature, and is a recreation to the heart and a delight to the\r\neye of both man and beast. To have a plentiful supply of it is one of\r\nthe greatest blessings of God to the creature, and to be able to bestow\r\nit wisely and employ it usefully is one of the most serviceable of human\r\narts. It is too valuable a servant to suffer to go idle, and many are\r\nthe offices it might do us, if, as it travels from the mountains to the\r\nsea-board, we caught it in its course, harnessed it to our chariot, and\r\nguided it to our aim. We should turn it to account every inch of its\r\nprogress, and compel it, as it can, to minister to our requirements by\r\nits irresistible energy. Its merely mechanical power is immense, and\r\nthis is due in great part to its incompressibility; for it is in virtue\r\nof this quality alone we can, by means of it, achieve feats not\r\notherwise feasible. How else could we have raised to its sublime height\r\nthat stupendous bridge which spans the Menai Straits, and which is the\r\nwonder of the beholder, as it is the boast of the designer? It stands\r\nwhere it does by the help of some mechanism indeed, but the true giant\r\nthat lifted it on his shoulders and bore it to its airy elevation was\r\nthe incompressible force of water, a fluid which is, strangely, the\r\nsimple product of the combination of two elastic transparent gases,\r\noxygen and hydrogen, neither of which apart has the thew and sinew of\r\nits offspring. Nay, it is this single element, which, acted on by heat\r\nor acting through machinery, fetches and carries for us over the wide\r\nglobe, and is fast weaving into one living web the far-scattered\r\ninterests of the world.\r\n\r\nWater was in primitive times utilised into a motive power by the help of\r\na mechanism of rude design, which yet is hardly out of date, and might\r\nrecently be seen in its original, still more in modified form, in\r\ncertain back-quarters of civilisation. A stream, guided by a sluice, was\r\nmade to play upon four vertical paddle-blades, attached to a shaft which\r\nthey caused to revolve, and which moved a millstone, resting upon\r\nanother through which it passed. It was a primitive mill, which\r\nsuperseded the still more primitive hand-mill, or quern; and I myself\r\nhave seen it at work in the Shetland Islands, and even the north of\r\nScotland, though it is now done away with even there, still more farther\r\nsouth, and its place supplied and its work done by overshot and\r\nunder-shot wheel-gear, and improved machinery attached, of less or more\r\ncomplexity. One of the most recent improvements is the Turbine, a sort\r\nof Barker's mill; it is of great power, small compass, and acts under a\r\ngood fall with a minimum expenditure of water-power.\r\n\r\nPassing from the consideration of water as a motive power in its natural\r\nstate, I ask you to notice briefly the gigantic force it can be made to\r\ndevelop under the action of heat. In its normal form the power of water\r\nis due, as I have said, to its incompressibility; in the state of\r\nvapour, to which it is reduced by heat, its power is due to the counter\r\nforce of expansion. It was when confined as a state prisoner in the\r\nTower of London that the Marquis of Worcester began to speculate on the\r\npossibilities of steam, though he little dreamed of its more important\r\napplications, and the incalculable services it might be made to render\r\nto the cause of humanity. Suddenly, one day, his musings in his solitude\r\nwere interrupted by the rattling of the lid of a kettle, which was\r\nboiling away on the fire beside him, when, being of a philosophic vein,\r\nhe commenced to inquire after the cause; and he soon reasoned himself\r\ninto the conclusion that the motive power lay in the tension of the\r\nvapour, and that the maintenance of this must be due to successive\r\nadditions of heat. The thought was a seed sown in a fit soil, for it led\r\nto experiments which confirmed the supposition, and inaugurated others\r\nthat have borne fruit, as we see. It was a great moment in the annals of\r\ndiscovery, and from that time to this the genius of improvement has\r\nmoved onward with unprecedented strides; and this in the application of\r\nsteam-power as well as the results, stupendous as these last have been.\r\nFor as there is no department of industry that has not made immense\r\nadvances since, none on which steam has not directly or indirectly been\r\nbrought to bear with effect; so there has been no end to the ingenuity\r\nand ingenious devices by which steam has been coaxed into subjection to\r\nhuman use and made the pliant minister of the master, man. All these\r\nresults follow as a natural consequence from the first discovery of its\r\nmotive power by the Marquis of Worcester, and the subsequent invention\r\nof James Watt, by which the force detected was rendered uniform, instead\r\nof fitful and spasmodic, as it had been before. And yet, important as\r\nwas the discovery of the one, and ingenious as is the invention of the\r\nother, both are of slight account in the presence of the great fact of\r\nnature observed by the English nobleman and humoured by the Scottish\r\nartisan. The _genie_ whom the one captured and the other tamed, is the\r\ngreat magic worker, apart from whose subtle strength their ingenuity had\r\nbeen wasted, and had come to naught.\r\n\r\nBut here I must restrain my rovings, and recall my purpose to descant on\r\nother points. And indeed the uses of water are so numerous and varied\r\nthat the subject might well engross a lecture by itself; and I must\r\nneeds therefore cut the matter short. It is only Hodge-Podge, moreover,\r\nI have undertaken to dish up before you, and I must keep my word. For,\r\nfain as I am to dilate on the many economic virtues of water, I must not\r\nforget that the pot contains other ingredients, and that the dish I am\r\nserving out of it would yield but poor fare, if it did not.\r\n\r\n2. I come therefore to the next ingredient in the soup I am providing;\r\nfor, as the housewife said, \"there's mutton intilt,\" and it is the most\r\nimportant ingredient in the mess. But the animal which produces it, like\r\nthe kindred animals that produce the like, serves other purposes as\r\nwell, and these no less essential to the exigency of the race; and it is\r\nof them I propose to speak. It is beside my design to enter on the\r\ndomain of the sheep-breeder, and attempt an account of the different\r\nkinds reared by the farmer; enough to say that, numerous as these are,\r\nthey are all fed and tended for the benefit of the human family, and\r\nthat they minister to the supply of the same human wants.\r\n\r\nThe child, as it frolics on the lawn, stops his gambols and steps gently\r\naside to coax, to caress his woolly-fleeced companion; and the mother\r\ntalks softly to her child of the innocent darlings, and asks if they are\r\nnot lovely creatures, and beautiful to look at, as they timidly wander\r\nfrom spot to spot, and nibble the delicate pasture. So it is to the\r\nlively fancy of childhood, and so it is to the mother whose affections\r\nare naturally melted into softness in the presence of simplicity; but\r\nwhen economic considerations arise, and the question is one of service\r\nand value, all such sentimental and aesthetic emotions pass out of\r\ncourt, and only calculations of base utilitarianism fill the eye from\r\nhorizon to horizon. No doubt the creatures are lovely and beautiful to\r\nbehold on the meadows and hill-sides of the landscape, which they\r\nenliven and adorn; but man must live as well as admire, and unless by\r\nsacrifice of the sheep he must not only go without hodge-podge to his\r\ndinner, but dispense with much else equally necessary to his life and\r\nwelfare. The cook requires the sacrifice, that he may purvey for the\r\ntables of both gentle and semple; the tallow-dealer requires the\r\nsacrifice, that he may provide light for our homesteads, and oil for our\r\nengines, both stationary and locomotive; and the wool-merchant and the\r\ncurrier insist on stripping the victim of his fleece, and even flaying\r\nhis skin, before they can assure us of fit clothing and covering against\r\ncold and rain for our bodies and our belongings. And what a wretched\r\nplight we should be in, if the sheep, or their like, did not come to the\r\nrescue, or the help they are fitted to render were not laid under\r\ncontribution! For not only might we be fated to go often dinnerless to\r\nbed, and to live all our days in a body imperfectly nourished, but our\r\nevenings would in many cases be spent without light, and our journeys\r\nundertaken without comfort, and our outer man left to battle at odds,\r\nunshod and unprotected, with the discomforts of the highway and the\r\ninclemency of the seasons. Of all the services rendered by the sheep to\r\nthe race of man, perhaps the most invaluable is that which is accorded\r\nin the gift of wool; and it is for the sake of this alone that, in many\r\nquarters, whole flocks, and even breeds, are reared and tended,--so\r\ngreat is the demand for it, and such the esteem in which it is held for\r\nthe purpose of clothing the body and keeping it in warmth.\r\n\r\n3. But, again, to advance a step further, there are, as the landlady of\r\nthe inn remarked, \"neeps intilt.\" On this part of the subject, that I\r\nmay pass to the next topic on which I mean to speak, and which is of\r\nwider range, I intend to say little. I have already referred to the\r\nimportant place assigned to this vegetable by a living economist as\r\naffording a basis for grouping society into two great classes. To the\r\nfarmer it is of equal, and far more practical, importance; for it is, by\r\nthe manner of its cultivation, a great means of clearing the land of\r\nweeds; it is the chief support of sheep and cattle through the months of\r\nwinter; and it is one of the most valuable crops raised on British soil,\r\nand of equal account in the agriculture of both England and Scotland.\r\nThe culture of turnips on farms involves considerable expense indeed,\r\nand is sometimes attended with loss, and even failure; but they are of\r\ninestimable value in cattle husbandry, as without them our sheepfarms\r\nwould soon be depopulated, and the animals hardly outlive a winter. One\r\nfunction they, and the like, fulfil in nature, is turning inorganic\r\nmatter into vegetable, that the component elements may in this form be\r\nmore readily assimilated into animal flesh and blood; while their\r\nintroduction as an article of farming is of great importance as\r\nrendering possible and feasible a regular rotation of crops.\r\n\r\n4. But I must, as I said, hasten on to another ingredient of the dish we\r\nare compounding; I refer to barley, for that too, as our gracious\r\nhostess would say, is \"_intilt_.\" From this single grain what virtues\r\nhave been developed! what mildness, what soothing, what nourishment, and\r\nwhat strength! What a source it is to us of comfort, of enjoyment, and\r\nof wealth! There is barley-water, for instance, a beverage most\r\nharmless, yet most soothing; meet drink for the sick-room, and specially\r\npromotive of the secretions in patients whose disease is inflammatory,\r\nand who suffer from thirst. Then there is barley-bread, extensively used\r\nin both England and Scotland, than which there is none more wholesome to\r\nthe blood and more nourishing to the system; the meal of which is of\r\nservice too in the shape of a medical appliance, and, when so used,\r\nacts with most beneficial effect. But its strength is not so pronounced\r\nor decisive either in the form of an infusion or in that of bread, much\r\nas in these forms it contributes to health and vigour: it is not when it\r\nis put into the pot, or when bruised by the miller, that it comes out in\r\nthe fulness of its might; it is when it is immersed in water, and\r\nsubjected to heat, and metamorphosed into malt. In this form it can be\r\nconverted into a beverage that is simple and healthful, and, when used\r\naright, conducive to strength of muscle and general vigour of life; but\r\nwhen it has undergone a further process, which I am about to describe,\r\nit evolves a spirit so masterful that the weak would do well to\r\nwithstand its seductiveness, for only a strong head and a stout will\r\ndare with impunity to enter the lists with it, and can hope to retire\r\nfrom the contest with the strength unshorn and a firm footstep.[C]\r\n\r\nWhisky, which is what I now refer to as the highest outcome of the\r\nstrength of barley, is, like hodge-podge, of Scotch incubation, and\r\ndeserves, for country's sake and the fame it has, some brief regard. The\r\nprocess by which the grain is prepared may be described as follows. The\r\ngrain is first damped, then spread out on a floor, and finally a certain\r\nquantity of water and heat applied, when it begins to germinate, which\r\nit continues to do to a certain stage, beyond which it is not allowed to\r\npass. At this moment a Government official presents himself, and exacts\r\na duty of the manufacturer for the production of the malt, the\r\nauthorities shrewdly judging that they are entitled to levy off so\r\nvaluable an article a modicum of tax. The grain thus prepared is now in\r\na state for further manufacture, and it passes into the hands of the\r\nbrewer or distiller, to be converted into a more or less alcoholic\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nFirst the brewer produces therefrom those excellent beverages called\r\nbeer and porter, and so contributes to our refreshment, enjoyment, and\r\nstrength. These beverages are, in one shape or other, nearly in\r\nuniversal demand, and the money spent upon the consumption of Bass and\r\nXX almost passes belief. They are exported into every zone of the\r\nworld, and consumed by every class. And then the distiller takes the\r\ngrain in the same form, and, by slow evaporation and subsequent\r\ncondensation, extracts the pure, subtle, and potent spirit we have\r\nreferred to, and which, in more or less diluted form, we call whisky, or\r\nScotch drink. And this article also, in spite of cautions, is in large\r\ndemand and extensively exported, though perhaps not so much is consumed\r\namong us as was fifty years ago. It is not by any means so bad an\r\narticle as it has a bad name; for when of good quality, and moderately\r\nindulged in, it is perfectly wholesome; only when the quality is bad, or\r\nthe indulgence excessive, do evil results follow. And indeed such are\r\nits merits when good, that it is said dealers sometimes export it to\r\nFrance and other parts, from which it is imported again to this country,\r\ntransfused into splendidly labelled brandy bottles, and sold\r\nuntransformed as best brandy!\r\n\r\nLittle do we think, when eating our quiet dinner at a Scottish country\r\ninn, what power and wealth are represented in the hodge-podge which\r\nbelike forms one of the dishes, and which, by suggestion and in the\r\nstyle of the housewife, we are now analysing. As we disintegrate the\r\nmess, and resolve it into its elements, we may well bethink ourselves of\r\nthe cost of our board on the planet, and of the value of the articles we\r\nare daily consuming. To help you to a clearer idea of this, in regard to\r\nthe article barley alone in the form of malt, let me commend to your\r\nattention the following statistical statement:--\r\n\r\nA Parliamentary return of 1876 shows that the quantity of _malt_ charged\r\nwith _duty_ during the year was--\r\n\r\n                                BUSHELS.            DUTY.\r\nEngland,                       54,655,274        £7,412,621\r\nScotland,                       2,927,763           396,241\r\nIreland,                        3,346,606           453,883\r\n                               ----------        ----------\r\nTotal of United Kingdom,       60,929,633        £8,262,746\r\n\r\nThe quantity of barley imported into the United Kingdom during the year\r\nwas equivalent to 2,736,425 quarters. See how great a fire a little\r\nspark, hodge-podge, kindleth!\r\n\r\nSo much for the quantity of malt produced, and the revenue derived from\r\nit, in a year in the United Kingdom. I have spoken of this malt as being\r\nconvertible into a form which possesses, among other virtues, the power\r\nof quenching our thirst. I wish it did not also quench our thirst for\r\nthe knowledge we all ought to have of its production and really\r\nserviceable qualities; that it would stimulate inquiry after such\r\nthings, and not smother it, as it is too apt to do; and, in general,\r\nprompt us to a wiser study of our social wants, and the means at our\r\ncommand for further social improvement; which we might prosecute with\r\nless and less recourse to the stimulant virtues of malt in such forms as\r\nwhisky. And this we may do, if we limit our indulgence in it to the less\r\npotent form of it in beer, which, while it is calculated to quench man's\r\nbodily thirst, is equally calculated to quicken his mental. How much it\r\ncontributes to allay the former, and how many thirsty souls are\r\nrefreshed by it, we may estimate from the statistics of the sale of it\r\nfurnished by a single firm in London. I refer to the firm of the Messrs.\r\nFoster, Brook Street, who are friends of my own, and to whom I should be\r\nglad to refer all who may be in want of a wholesome beer, for theirs is\r\nso good and genuine. The Messrs. Foster are among the most extensive\r\nbottlers and exporters in the country; and I find from the information\r\nthey have kindly supplied me, that the beer bottled by them for export\r\npurposes during the year 1874 was 6000 butts, of 108 gallons each; that\r\ntheir contracts for the supply of bottles during that period represented\r\n25,000 gross, or 5,040,000 bottles, which, if laid end to end, would\r\nextend to about 1000 miles; and that their accounts with Bass & Co.\r\nalone for that term amounted to £150,000. All, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, drink beer in England; and when unadulterated and taken in\r\nmoderation, it is one of the most healthful beverages of which the human\r\nbeing, man or woman, can partake.\r\n\r\nThough I have only partially gone over the ground contemplated at first,\r\nI feel I must now draw to a conclusion, which I am the less indisposed\r\nto do, as I think in what I have said I have pretty fairly set before\r\nyou the wonderful properties latent in a basin of hodge-podge. For it is\r\na habit of mine, which I have sought to indulge on the present occasion,\r\nto analyse every subject to which my attention is directed, and in which\r\nI feel interest, before I can make up my mind as to the proper\r\nsignificance and importance of the whole compound. Thus, for instance,\r\nset a dish of hodge-podge before me; it does not satisfy me to be told\r\nthat it is only a basin of broth, and that it is wholesome fare; I\r\nmust, as I have now been doing in a way, resolve the compound into its\r\nelements, see these in other and wider relations, and refer them\r\nmentally to their rank and standing in the larger world of the economy\r\nof nature and of social existence. I am always asking \"What's intilt?\"\r\nand am never satisfied, any more than the English tourist, with a bare\r\nenumeration: I must subject the factors included to rational inspection,\r\nand watch their play and weigh their worth in connection with interests\r\nmore general.\r\n\r\nAnd if, in the delivery of this lecture, I have persuaded any one to\r\nregard common things in a similar light and from a similar interest, I\r\nshall deem the time spent on it not altogether thrown away. Mind, not\r\nwater, is the ultimate solvent in nature, and everything, when thrown\r\ninto it, will be found in the end to resolve itself into it, or what in\r\nnature is of kin to it. And if a Latin poet could justify his interest\r\nin man by a reference to his own humanity, so may we rest content with\r\nnature when we find that we and it are parts of each other. It is well\r\nto learn to look on nothing as private, but on everything as a part of\r\na great whole, of which we ourselves are units; so shall we feel\r\neverywhere at home, and a sense of kinship with the remote as well as\r\nnear within the round of existence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] The Highlanders are said to be able to offer it a stout defiance,\r\nfor they can stand an immense quantity; and I have heard of an innkeeper\r\nin the north, who, when remonstrated with on account of his excessive\r\ndrinking, so far admitted the justice of the charge implied, but pled\r\nthat he could not be accused of undue indulgence the night before, as,\r\nwhatever he might have drunk during the day, he had, after supper, had\r\nonly seventeen glasses!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINTED BY BALLANTYNE, HANSON AND CO.\r\n  EDINBURGH AND LONDON.",
