The book includes a description of the character,\r\n    structure, properties, varieties, and classification of\r\n    timbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE OF WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that the suitability of wood for a particular\r\npurpose depends most of all upon its internal structure, it is plain\r\nthat the woodworker should know the essential characteristics of that\r\nstructure. While his main interest in wood is as lumber, dead material\r\nto be used in woodworking, he can properly understand its structure\r\nonly by knowing something of it as a live, growing organism. To\r\nfacilitate this, a knowledge of its position in the plant world is\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nAll the useful woods are to be found in the highest sub-kingdom of\r\nthe plant world, the flowering plants or Phanerogamia of the botanist.\r\nThese flowering plants are to be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n                         {  I. Gymnosperms.  (Naked seeds.)\r\n                         {       1. Cycadaceae.  (Palms, ferns, etc.)\r\n                         {       2. Gnetaceae.  (Joint firs.)\r\n                         {       3. Conifers. Pines, firs, etc.\r\nPhanerogamia,            { II. Angiosperms. (Fruits.)\r\n(Flowering plants)       {       1. Monocotyledons.

Broad-leaved trees.\r\n\r\nUnder the division of naked-seeded plants (gymnosperms), practically\r\nthe only valuable timber-bearing plants are the needle-leaved trees\r\nor the conifers, including such trees as the pines, cedars, spruces,\r\nfirs, etc. Their wood grows rapidly in concentric annual rings, like\r\nthat of the broad-leaved trees; is easily worked, and is more widely\r\nused than the wood of any other class of trees.\r\n\r\nOf fruit-bearing trees (angiosperms), there are two classes, those\r\nthat have one seed-leaf as they germinate, and those that have two\r\nseed-leaves.\r\n\r\nThe one seed-leaf plants (monocotyledons) include the grasses, lilies,\r\nbananas, palms, etc. Of these there are only a few that reach\r\nthe dimensions of trees. They are strikingly distinguished by the\r\nstructure of their stems. They have no cambium layer and no distinct\r\nbark and pith; they have unbranched stems, which as a rule do not\r\nincrease in diameter after the first stages of growth, but grow only\r\nterminally. Instead of having concentric annual rings and thus growing\r\nlarger year by year, the woody tissue grows here and there thru the\r\nstem, but mostly crowded together toward the outer surfaces. Even\r\nwhere there is radial growth, as in yucca, the structure is not\r\nin annual rings, but irregular. These one seed-leaf trees\r\n(monocotyledons) are not of much economic value as lumber, being used\r\nchiefly \"in the round,\" and to some extent for veneers and inlays;\r\n_e.g._, cocoanut-palm and porcupine wood are so used.\r\n\r\nThe most useful of the monocotyledons, or endogens, (\"inside growers,\"\r\nas they are sometimes called,) are the bamboos, which are giant\r\nmembers of the group of grasses, Fig. 1. They grow in dense forests,\r\nsome varieties often 70 feet high and 6 inches in diameter, shooting\r\nup their entire height in a single season. Bamboo is very highly\r\nvalued in the Orient, where it is used for masts, for house rafters,\r\nand other building purposes, for gutters and water-pipes and in\r\ncountless other ways. It is twice as strong as any of our woods.\r\n\r\nUnder the fruit-bearing trees (angiosperms), timber trees are chiefly\r\nfound among those that have two seed-leaves (the dicotyledons) and\r\ninclude the great mass of broad-leaved or deciduous trees such as\r\nchestnut, oak, ash and maple. It is to these and to the conifers that\r\nour principal attention will be given, since they constitute the bulk\r\nof the wood in common use.\r\n\r\nThe timber-bearing trees, then, are the:\r\n\r\n(1) Conifers, the needle-leaved, naked-seeded trees, such as pine,\r\ncedar, etc. Fig. 45, p. 199.\r\n\r\n(2) Endogens, which have one seed-leaf, such as bamboos, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n(3) Broad-leaved trees, having two seed-leaves, such as oak, beech,\r\nand elm. Fig. 48, p. 202.\r\n\r\nThe common classifications of trees are quite inaccurate. Many of\r\nthe so-called deciduous (Latin, _deciduus_, falling off) trees are\r\nevergreen, such as holly, and, in the south, live oak, magnolia and\r\ncherry. So, too, some of the alleged \"evergreens,\" like bald cypress\r\nand tamarack, shed their leaves annually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. A Bamboo Grove, Kioto, Japan.]\r\n\r\nNot all of the \"conifers\" bear cones. For example, the juniper bears\r\na berry. The ginko, Fig. 2, tho classed among the \"conifers,\" the\r\n\"evergreens,\" and the \"needle-leaf\" trees, bears no cones, has broad\r\nleaves and is deciduous. It has an especial interest as being the sole\r\nsurvivor of many species which grew abundantly in the carboniferous\r\nage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Ginko Leaf.]\r\n\r\nAlso, the terms used by lumbermen, \"hard woods\" for broad-leaved trees\r\nand \"soft woods\" for conifers, are still less exact, for the wood of\r\nsome broad-leaved trees, as bass and poplar, is much softer than that\r\nof some conifers, as Georgia pine and lignum vitae.\r\n\r\nAnother classification commonly made is that of \"endogens\" (inside\r\ngrowers) including bamboos, palms, etc., and exogens (outside growers)\r\nwhich would include both conifers and broad-leaved trees.\r\n\r\nOne reason why so many classifications have come into use is that none\r\nof them is quite accurate. A better one will be explained later. See\r\np. 23.\r\n\r\nAs in the study of all woods three sections are made, it is well at\r\nthe outset to understand clearly what these are.\r\n\r\nThe sections of a tree made for its study are (Fig. 3):\r\n\r\n(1) Transverse, a plane at right angles to the organic axis.\r\n\r\n(2) Radial, a longitudinal plane, including the organic axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n  A, B, C, D, Transverse Section.\r\n  B, D, E, F, Radial Section.\r\n  G, H, I, J, Tangential Section.\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\n  A, B, C, Transverse Section.\r\n  A, B, D, E, Radial Section.\r\n  B, C, E, F, Tangential Section.\r\n]\r\n\r\n(3) Tangential, a longitudinal plane not including the organic axis.\r\n\r\nIf a transverse section of the trunk of a conifer or of a broad-leaved\r\ntree is made, it is to be noted that it consists of several distinct\r\nparts. See Fig. 4. These, beginning at the outside, are:\r\n\r\n(1) Rind or bark\r\n  (a) Cortex\r\n  (b) Bast\r\n\r\n(2) Cambium\r\n\r\n(3) Wood\r\n  (a) Sap-wood\r\n  (b) Heart-wood\r\n\r\n(4) Pith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Diagram of Cross-section of Three Year Old Stem\r\nof Basswood.]\r\n\r\n(1) The rind or _bark_ is made up of two layers, the outer of which,\r\nthe \"cortex,\" is corky and usually scales or pulls off easily; while\r\nthe inner one is a fibrous coat called \"bast\" or \"phloem.\" Together\r\nthey form a cone, widest, thickest, and roughest at the base and\r\nbecoming narrower toward the top of the tree. The cortex or outer bark\r\nserves to protect the stem of the tree from extremes of heat and cold,\r\nfrom atmospheric changes, and from the browsing of animals. It is made\r\nup of a tough water-proof layer of cork which has taken the place of\r\nthe tender skin or \"epidermis\" of the twig. Because it is water-proof\r\nthe outside tissue is cut off from the water supply of the tree, and\r\nso dries up and peels off, a mass of dead matter. The cork and the\r\ndead stuff together are called the bark. As we shall see later, the\r\ncork grows from the inside, being formed in the inner layers of the\r\ncortex, the outer layers of dry bark being thus successively cut off.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the tree bark are due to the positions and\r\nkinds of tissue of these new layers of cork. Each tree has its own\r\nkind of bark, and the bark of some is so characteristic as to make the\r\ntree easily recognizable.\r\n\r\nBark may be classified according to formation and method of\r\nseparation, as scale bark, which detaches from the tree in plates,\r\nas in the willows; membraneous bark, which comes off in ribbons and\r\nfilms, as in the birches; fibrous bark, which is in the form of stiff\r\nthreads, as in the grape vine; and fissured bark, which breaks up\r\nin longitudinal fissures, showing ridges, grooves and broad, angular\r\npatches, as in oak, chestnut and locust. The last is the commonest\r\nform of bark.\r\n\r\nThe bark of certain kinds of trees, as cherry and birch, has peculiar\r\nmarkings which consist of oblong raised spots or marks, especially\r\non the young branches. These are called lenticels (Latin _lenticula_,\r\nfreckle), and have two purposes: they admit air to the internal\r\ntissues, as it were for breathing, and they also emit water vapor.\r\nThese lenticels are to be found on all trees, even where the bark is\r\nvery thick, as old oaks and chestnuts, but in these the lenticels are\r\nin the bottoms of the deep cracks. There is a great difference in\r\nthe inflammability of bark, some, like that of the big trees of\r\nCalifornia, Fig. 54, p. 209, which is often two feet thick, being\r\npractically incombustible, and hence serving to protect the tree;\r\nwhile some bark, as canoe birch, is laden with an oil which burns\r\nfuriously. It therefore makes admirable kindling for camp fires, even\r\nin wet weather.\r\n\r\nInside the cork is the \"phloem\" or \"bast,\" which, by the way, gives\r\nits name to the bass tree, the inner bark of which is very tough and\r\nfibrous and therefore used for mat and rope making. In a living tree,\r\nthe bast fibers serve to conduct the nourishment which has been made\r\nin the leaves down thru the stem to the growing parts.\r\n\r\n(2) The _cambium_. Inside of the rind and between it and the wood,\r\nthere is, on living trees, a slimy coat called cambium (Med. Latin,\r\nexchange). This is the living, growing part of the stem, familiar to\r\nall who have peeled it as the sticky, slimy coat between the bark\r\nand the wood of a twig. This is what constitutes the fragrant,\r\nmucilaginous inner part of the bark of slippery elm. Cambium is a\r\ntissue of young and growing cells, in which the new cells are formed,\r\nthe inner ones forming the wood and the outer ones the bark.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the cambium and its function, consider its\r\nappearance in a bud, Fig. 5. A cross-section of the bud of a growing\r\nstem examined under the microscope, looks like a delicate mesh of thin\r\nmembrane, filled in with a viscid semi-fluid substance which is called\r\n\"protoplasm\" (Greek, _protos_, first; _plasma_, form). These meshes\r\nwere first called \"cells\" by Robert Hooke, in 1667, because of their\r\nresemblance to the chambers of a honeycomb. The walls of these\r\n\"cells\" are their most prominent feature and, when first studied,\r\nwere supposed to be the essential part; but later the slimy, colorless\r\nsubstance which filled the cells was found to be the essential part.\r\nThis slimy substance, called protoplasm, constitutes the primal stuff\r\nof all living things. The cell walls themselves are formed from it.\r\nThese young cells, at the apex of a stem, are all alike, very small,\r\nfilled with protoplasm, and as yet, unaltered. They form embryonic\r\ntissue, _i.e._ one which will change. One change to which an cell\r\nfilled with protoplasm is liable is division into two, a new partition\r\nwall forming within it. This is the way plant cells increase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Young Stem, Magnified 18-1/2 Diameters, Showing\r\nPrimary and Secondary Bundles. _By Courtesy of Mrs. Katharine Golden\r\nBitting._\r\n\r\nE, epidermis, the single outside layer of cells.\r\n\r\nC, cortex, the region outside of the bundles.\r\n\r\nHB, hard bast, the black, irregular ring protecting the soft bast.\r\n\r\nSB, soft bast, the light, crescent-shaped parts.\r\n\r\nCa, cambium, the line between the soft bast and the wood.\r\n\r\nW, wood, segments showing pores.\r\n\r\nMR, medullary rays, lines between the bundles connecting the pith and\r\nthe cortex.\r\n\r\nMS, medullary sheath, the dark, irregular ring just inside the\r\nbundles.\r\n\r\nP, pith, the central mass of cells.]\r\n\r\nIn young plant cells, the whole cavity of the chamber is filled with\r\nprotoplasm, but as the cells grow older and larger, the protoplasm\r\ndevelops into different parts, one part forming the cell wall and in\r\nmany cases leaving cavities within the cell, which become filled with\r\nsap. The substance of the cell wall is called cellulose (cotton and\r\nflax fibers consist of almost pure cellulose). At first it has no\r\ndefinite structure, but as growth goes on, it may become thickened\r\nin layers, or gummy, or hardened into lignin (wood), according to the\r\nfunction to be performed. Where there are a group of similar cells\r\nperforming the same functions, the group is called a tissue or, if\r\nlarge enough, a tissue system.\r\n\r\nWhen cells are changed into new forms, or \"differentiated,\" as it is\r\ncalled, they become permanent tissues. These permanent tissues of the\r\ntree trunk constitute the various parts which we have noticed, viz.,\r\nthe rind, the pith and the wood.\r\n\r\nThe essentially living part of the tree, it should be remembered, is\r\nthe protoplasm: where there is protoplasm, there is life and growth.\r\nIn the stems of the conifers and broad-leaved trees--sometimes\r\ntogether called exogens--this protoplasm is to be found in the buds\r\nand in the cambium sheath, and these are the growing parts of the\r\ntree. If we followed up the sheath of cambium which envelopes a stem,\r\ninto a terminal bud, we should find that it passed without break into\r\nthe protoplasm of the bud.\r\n\r\nIn the cross-section of a young shoot, we might see around the central\r\npith or medulla, a ring of wedge-shaped patches. These are really\r\nbundles of cells running longitudinally from the rudiments of leaves\r\nthru the stem to the roots. They are made of protoplasm and are called\r\nthe \"procambium strands,\" Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Three Stages in the Development of an Exogenous\r\nStem. P, pith; PB, primary bast; SB, secondary bast; C, cambium;\r\nPR, pith ray; PW, primary wood; SW, secondary wood; PS, procambium\r\nstrands. _After Boulger._]\r\n\r\nIn the monocotyledons (endogens) these procambium strands change\r\ncompletely into wood and bast, and so losing all their protoplasmic\r\ncambium, become incapable of further growth. This is why palms can\r\ngrow only lengthwise, or else by forming new fibers more densely in\r\nthe central mass. But in the conifers and broad-leaved trees, the\r\ninner part of each strand becomes wood and the outer part bast (bark).\r\nBetween these bundles, connecting the pith in the center with the\r\ncortex on the outside of the ring of bundles, are parts of the\r\noriginal pith tissue of the stem. They are the primary pith or\r\nmedullary rays (Latin, _medulla_, pith). The number of medullary rays\r\ndepends upon the number of the bundles; and their form, on the width\r\nof the bundles, so that they are often large and conspicuous, as in\r\noak, or small and indeed invisible, as in some of the conifers. But\r\nthey are present in all exogenous woods, and can readily be seen with\r\nthe microscope. Stretching across these pith rays from the cambium\r\nlayer in one procambium strand to that in the others, the cambium\r\nformation extends, making a complete cylindrical sheath from the bud\r\ndownward over the whole stem. This is the cambium sheath and is the\r\nliving, growing part of the stem from which is formed the wood on the\r\ninside and the rind (bark) on the outside.\r\n\r\nIn the first year the wood and the bast are formed directly by the\r\ngrowth and change of the inner and outer cells respectively of the\r\nprocambium strand, and all such material is called \"primary;\" but\r\nin subsequent years all wood, pith rays, and bast, originate in the\r\ncambium, and these growths are called \"secondary.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Sap-wood and Heart-wood, Lignum Vitae.]\r\n\r\n(3) The _wood_ of most exogens is made up of two parts, a lighter\r\npart called the sap-wood or splint-wood or alburnum, and a darker part\r\ncalled the heart-wood or duramen, Fig. 7. Sap-wood is really immature\r\nheartwood. The difference in color between them is very marked in some\r\nwoods, as in lignum vitae and black walnut, and very slight in\r\nothers, as spruce and bass. Indeed, some species never form a distinct\r\nheart-wood, birch (_Betula alba_) being an example.\r\n\r\nIn a living tree, sap-wood and heart-wood perform primarily quite\r\ndifferent functions. The sap-wood carries the water from the roots to\r\nthe leaves, stores away starch at least in winter, and in other ways\r\nassists the life of the tree. The proportional amount of sapwood\r\nvaries greatly, often, as in long-leaf pine, constituting 40 per cent.\r\nof the stem.\r\n\r\nAs the sap-wood grows older, its cells become choked so that the sap\r\ncan no longer flow thru them. It loses its protoplasm and starch and\r\nbecomes heartwood, in which all cells are dead and serve only the\r\nmechanical function of holding up the great weight of the tree and\r\nin resisting wind pressures. This is the reason why a tree may become\r\ndecayed and hollow and yet be alive and bear fruit. In a tree that is\r\nactually dead the sap-wood rots first.\r\n\r\nChemical substances infiltrate into the cell walls of heart-wood and\r\nhence it has a darker color than the sap-wood. Persimmon turns black,\r\nwalnut purplish brown, sumac yellow, oak light brown, tulip and poplar\r\nyellowish, redwood and cedar brownish red. Many woods, as mahogany and\r\noak, darken under exposure, which shows that the substances producing\r\nthe color are oxidizable and unstable. Wood dyes are obtained by\r\nboiling and distilling such woods as sumach, logwood, red sanders,\r\nand fustic. Many woods also acquire distinct odors, as camphor,\r\nsandalwood, cedar, cypress, pine and mahogany, indicating the presence\r\nof oil.\r\n\r\nAs a rule heart-wood is more valuable for timber, being harder,\r\nheavier, and drier than sap-wood. In woods like hickory and ash,\r\nhowever, which are used for purposes that require pliability, as in\r\nbaskets, or elasticity as in handles of rakes and hoes, sap-wood is\r\nmore valuable than heart-wood.\r\n\r\nIn a transverse section of a conifer, for example Douglas spruce, Fig.\r\n8, the wood is seen to lie in concentric rings, the outer part of the\r\nring being darker in color than the inner part. In reality each\r\nof these rings is a section of an irregular hollow cone, each cone\r\nenveloping its inner neighbor. Each cone ordinarily constitutes a\r\nyear's growth, and therefore there is a greater number of them at\r\nthe base of a tree than higher up. These cones vary greatly in\r\n_thickness_, or, looking at a cross-section, the rings vary in\r\n_width_; in general, those at the center being thicker than those\r\ntoward the bark. Variations from year to year may also be noticed,\r\nshowing that the tree was well nourished one year and poorly nourished\r\nanother year. Rings, however, do not always indicate a year's growth.\r\n\"False rings\" are sometimes formed by a cessation in the growth due\r\nto drouth, fire or other accident, followed by renewed growth the same\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Section of Douglas Fir, Showing Annual Rings\r\nand Knots at Center of Trunk. _American Museum of Natural History, N.\r\nY._]\r\n\r\nIn a radial section of a log, Fig. 8, these \"rings\" appear as a series\r\nof parallel lines and if one could examine a long enough log these\r\nlines would converge, as would the cut edges in a nest of cones, if\r\nthey were cut up thru the center, as in Fig. 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Diagram of Radial Section of Log (exaggerated)\r\nShowing Annual Cones of Growth.]\r\n\r\nIn a tangential section, the lines appear as broad bands, and since\r\nalmost no tree grows perfectly straight, these lines are wavy, and\r\ngive the characteristic pleasing \"grain\" of wood. Fig. 27, p. 35. The\r\nannual rings can sometimes be discerned in the bark as well as in the\r\nwood, as in corks, which are made of the outer bark of the cork oak, a\r\nproduct of southern Europe and northern Africa. Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Annual Rings in Bark (cork).]\r\n\r\nThe growth of the wood of exogenous trees takes place thru the\r\nability, already noted, of protoplasmic cells to divide. The cambium\r\ncells, which have very thin walls, are rectangular in shape, broader\r\ntangentially than radially, and tapering above and below to a chisel\r\nedge, Fig. 11. After they have grown somewhat radially, partition\r\nwalls form across them in the longitudinal, tangential direction,\r\nso that in place of one initial cell, there are two daughter cells\r\nradially disposed. Each of these small cells grows and re-divides, as\r\nin Fig. 12. Finally the innermost cell ceases to divide, and uses its\r\nprotoplasm to become thick and hard wood. In like manner the outermost\r\ncambium cell becomes bast, while the cells between them continue to\r\ngrow and divide, and so the process goes on. In nearly all stems,\r\nthere is much more abundant formation of wood than of bast cells. In\r\nother words, more cambium cells turn to wood than to bast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Diagram Showing Grain of Spruce Highly\r\nMagnified. PR, pith rays; BP, bordered pits; Sp W, spring wood; SW,\r\nsummer wood; CC, overlapping of chisel shaped ends.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Diagram Showing the Mode of Division of the\r\nCambium Cells. The cambium cell is shaded to distinguish it from the\r\ncells derived from it. Note in the last division at the right that\r\nthe inner daughter cell becomes the cambium cell while the outer cell\r\ndevelops into a bast cell. _From Curtis: Nature and Development of\r\nPlants._]\r\n\r\nIn the spring when there is comparatively little light and heat, when\r\nthe roots and leaves are inactive and feeble, and when the bark, split\r\nby winter, does not bind very tightly, the inner cambium cells produce\r\nradially wide wood cells with relatively thin walls. These constitute\r\nthe spring wood. But in summer the jacket of bark binds tightly, there\r\nis plenty of heat and light, and the leaves and roots are very active,\r\nso that the cambium cells produce thicker walled cells, called summer\r\nwood. During the winter the trees rest, and no development takes\r\nplace until spring, when the large thin-walled cells are formed again,\r\nmaking a sharp contrast with those formed at the end of the previous\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nIt is only at the tips of the branches that the cambium cells grow\r\nmuch in length; so that if a nail were driven into a tree twenty years\r\nold at, say, four feet from the ground, it would still be four feet\r\nfrom the ground one hundred years later.\r\n\r\nLooking once more at the cross-section, say, of spruce, the inner\r\nportion of each ring is lighter in color and softer in texture than\r\nthe outer portion. On a radial or tangential section, one's finger\r\nnail can easily indent the inner portion of the ring, tho the outer\r\ndark part of the ring may be very hard. The inner, light, soft portion\r\nof the ring is the part that grows in the spring and early summer,\r\nand is called the \"spring wood\" while the part that grows later in the\r\nseason is called \"summer wood.\" As the summer wood is hard and heavy,\r\nit largely determines the strength and weight of the wood, so that as\r\na rule, the greater the proportion of the summer growth, the better\r\nthe wood. This can be controlled to some extent by proper forestry\r\nmethods, as is done in European larch forests, by \"underplanting\" them\r\nwith beech.\r\n\r\nIn a normal tree, the summer growth forms a greater proportion of the\r\nwood formed during the period of thriftiest growth, so that in neither\r\nyouth nor old age, is there so great a proportion of summer wood as in\r\nmiddle age.\r\n\r\nIt will help to make clear the general structure of wood if one\r\nimagines the trunk of a tree to consist of a bundle of rubber tubes\r\ncrushed together, so that they assume angular shapes and have no\r\nspaces between them. If the tubes are laid in concentric layers, first\r\na layer which has thin walls, then successive layers having thicker\r\nand thicker walls, then suddenly a layer of thin-walled tubes and\r\nincreasing again to thick-walled ones and so on, such an arrangement\r\nwould represent the successive annual \"rings\" of conifers.\r\n\r\n_The medullary rays._ While most of the elements in wood run\r\nlongitudinally in the log, it is also to be noted that running at\r\nright angles to these and radially to the log, are other groups of\r\ncells called pith rays or medullary rays (Latin, _medulla_, which\r\nmeans pith). These are the large \"silver flakes\" to be seen in\r\nquartered oak, which give it its beautiful and distinctive grain, Fig.\r\n32, p. 38. They appear as long, grayish lines on a cross-section, as\r\nbroad, shining bands on the radial section, and as short, thick lines\r\ntapering at each end on the tangential section. In other words, they\r\nare like flat, rectangular plates standing on edge and radiating\r\nlengthwise from the center of the tree. They vary greatly in size in\r\ndifferent woods. In sycamore they are very prominent, Fig. 13. In oak\r\nthey are often several hundred cells wide (_i.e._, up and down in the\r\ntree). This may amount to an inch or two. They are often twenty cells\r\nthick, tapering to one cell at the edge. In oak very many are also\r\nsmall, even microscopic. But in the conifers and also in some of the\r\nbroad-leaved trees, altho they can be discerned with the naked eye on\r\na split radial surface, still they are all very small. In pine there\r\nare some 15,000 of them to a square inch of a tangential section. They\r\nare to be found in all exogens. In a cross-section, say of oak, Fig.\r\n14, it can readily be seen that some pith rays begin at the center\r\nof the tree and some farther out. Those that start from the pith are\r\nformed the first year and are called primary pith rays, while those\r\nthat begin in a subsequent year, starting at the cambium of that year,\r\nare called secondary rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Tangential Section of Sycamore, Magnified 37\r\nDiameters. Note the large size of the pith rays, A, A (end view).]\r\n\r\nThe function of the pith rays is twofold. (1) They transfer formative\r\nmaterial from one part of a stem to another, communicating with both\r\nwood and bark by means of the simple and bordered pits in them, and\r\n(2) they bind the trunk together from pith to bark. On the other hand\r\ntheir presence makes it easier for the wood to split radially.\r\n\r\nThe substance of which they are composed is \"parenchyma\" (Greek,\r\n_beside_, to _pour_), which also constitutes the pith, the rays\r\nforming a sort of connecting link between the first and last growth of\r\nthe tree, as the cambium cells form new wood each year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14 Cross-section of White Oak. The Radiating White\r\nLines are the Pith Rays.]\r\n\r\nIf a cambium cell is opposite to a pith ray, it divides crosswise\r\n(transversely) into eight or ten cells one above another, which\r\nstretch out radially, retaining their protoplasm, and so continue the\r\npith ray. As the tree grows larger, new, or secondary medullary rays\r\nstart from the cambium then active, so that every year new rays are\r\nformed both thinner and shorter than the primary rays, Fig. 14.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that laid among the ordinary thin-walled tubes were quite\r\nlarge tubes, so that one could tell the \"ring\" not only by the thin\r\nwalls but by the presence of large tubes. That would represent the\r\nring-porous woods, and the large tubes would be called vessels, or\r\n_tracheae_. Suppose again that these large tubes were scattered\r\nin disorder thru the layers. This arrangement would represent the\r\ndiffuse-porous woods.\r\n\r\nBy holding up to the light, thin cross-sections of spruce or pine,\r\nFig. 15, oak or ash, Fig. 16, and bass or maple, Fig. 17, these three\r\nquite distinct arrangements in the structure may be distinguished.\r\nThis fact has led to the classification of woods according to the\r\npresence and distribution of \"pores,\" or as they are technically\r\ncalled, \"vessels\" or \"tracheae.\" By this classification we have:\r\n\r\n(1) _Non-porous_ woods, which comprise the conifers, as pine and\r\nspruce.\r\n\r\n(2) _Ring-porous_ woods, in which the pores appear (in a\r\ncross-section) in concentric rings, as in chestnut, ash and elm.\r\n\r\n(3) _Diffuse-porous_ woods, in which (in a cross-section) the rings\r\nare scattered irregularly thru the wood, as in bass, maple and yellow\r\npoplar.\r\n\r\nIn order to fully understand the structure of wood, it is necessary to\r\nexamine it still more closely thru the microscope, and since the three\r\nclasses of wood, non-porous, ring-porous and diffuse-porous, differ\r\nconsiderably in their minute structure, it is well to consider them\r\nseparately, taking the simplest first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Cross-section of Non-porous Wood, White Pine,\r\nFull Size (top toward pith).]\r\n\r\n_Non-porous woods._ In examining thru the microscope a transverse\r\nsection of white pine, Fig. 18:\r\n\r\n(1) The most noticeable characteristic is the regularity of\r\narrangement of the cells. They are roughly rectangular and arranged in\r\nranks and files.\r\n\r\n(2) Another noticeable feature is that they are arranged in belts, the\r\nthickness of their walls gradually increasing as the size of the cells\r\ndiminishes. Then the large thin-walled cells suddenly begin again,\r\nand so on. The width of one of these belts is the amount of a single\r\nyear's growth, the thin-walled cells being those that formed in\r\nspring, and the thick-walled ones those that formed in summer, the\r\ndarker color of the summer wood as well as its greater strength being\r\ncaused by there being more material in the same volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Cross-section of Ring-porous Wood, White Ash,\r\nFull Size (top toward pith).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Cross-section of Diffuse-porous Wood, Hard\r\nMaple, full size (top toward pith).]\r\n\r\n(3) Running radially (up and down in the picture) directly thru the\r\nannual belts or rings are to be seen what looks like fibers. These are\r\nthe pith or medullary rays. They serve to transfer formative material\r\nfrom one part of the stem to another and to bind the tree together\r\nfrom pith to bark.\r\n\r\n(4) Scattered here and there among the regular cells, are to be seen\r\nirregular gray or yellow dots which disturb the regularity of the\r\narrangement. These are _resin ducts_. (See cross-section of white\r\npine, Fig. 18.) They are not cells, but openings between cells, in\r\nwhich the resin, an excretion of the tree, accumulates, oozing out\r\nwhen the tree is injured. At least one function of resin is to protect\r\nthe tree from attacks of fungi.\r\n\r\nLooking now at the radial section, Fig. 18:\r\n\r\n(5) The first thing to notice is the straightness of the long cells\r\nand their overlapping where they meet endwise, like the ends of two\r\nchisels laid together, Fig. 11.\r\n\r\n(6) On the walls of the cells can be seen round spots called \"pits.\"\r\nThese are due to the fact that as the cell grows, the cell walls\r\nthicken, except in these small spots, where the walls remain thin and\r\ndelicate. The pit in a cell wall always coincides with the pit in\r\nan adjoining cell, there being only a thin membrane between, so that\r\nthere is practically free communication of fluids between the two\r\ncells. In a cross-section the pit appears as a canal, the length of\r\nwhich depends upon the thickness of the walls. In some cells, the\r\nthickening around the pits becomes elevated, forming a border,\r\nperforated in the center. Such pits are called bordered pits. These\r\npits, both simple and bordered, are waterways between the different\r\ncells. They are helps in carrying the sap up the tree.\r\n\r\n(7) The pith rays are also to be seen running across and interwoven\r\nin the other cells. It is to be noticed that they consist of several\r\ncells, one above another.\r\n\r\nIn the tangential section, Fig. 18:\r\n\r\n(8) The straightness and overlapping of the cells is to be seen again,\r\nand\r\n\r\n(9) The numerous ends of the pith rays appear.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the structure of coniferous wood is very regular and\r\nsimple, consisting mainly of cells of one sort, the pith rays being\r\ncomparatively unnoticeable. This uniformity is what makes the wood of\r\nconifers technically valuable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe cells of conifers are called tracheids, meaning \"like _tracheae_.\"\r\nThey are cells in which the end walls persist, that is, are not\r\nabsorbed and broken down when they meet end to end. In other words,\r\nconifers do not have continuous pores or vessels or \"_tracheae_,\" and\r\nhence are called \"non-porous\" woods.\r\n\r\nBut in other woods, the ends of some cells which meet endwise\r\nare absorbed, thus forming a continuous series of elements which\r\nconstitute an open tube. Such tubes are known as pores, or vessels,\r\nor \"tracheae,\" and sometimes extend thru the whole stem. Besides this\r\nmarked difference between the porous and non-porous woods, the porous\r\nwoods are also distinguished by the fact that instead of being made\r\nup, like the conifers of cells of practically only one kind, namely\r\ntracheids, they are composed of several varieties of cells. Besides\r\nthe tracheae and tracheids already noted are such cells as \"wood\r\nfiber,\" \"fibrous cells,\" and \"parenchyma.\" Fig. 19. Wood fiber proper\r\nhas much thickened lignified walls and no pits, and its main function\r\nis mechanical support. Fibrous cells are like the wood fibers except\r\nthat they retain their protoplasm. Parenchyma is composed of vertical\r\ngroups of short cells, the end ones of each group tapering to a point,\r\nand each group originates from the transverse division of one\r\ncambium cell. They are commonly grouped around the vessels (tracheae).\r\nParenchyma constitutes the pith rays and other similar fibers, retains\r\nits protoplasm, and becomes filled with starch in autumn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Isolated Fibers and Cells. _a_, four cells of\r\nwood parenchyma; _b_, two cells from a pith ray; _c_, a single cell\r\nor joint of a vessel, the openings, x, x, leading into its upper and\r\nlower neighbors; _d_, tracheid; _e_, wood fiber proper. _After Roth._]\r\n\r\nThe most common type of structure among the broad-leaved trees\r\ncontains tracheae, trachaeids, woody fiber, fibrous cells and\r\nparenchyma. Examples are poplars, birch, walnut, linden and locust. In\r\nsome, as ash, the tracheids are wanting; apple and maple have no woody\r\nfiber, and oak and plum no fibrous cells.\r\n\r\nThis recital is enough to show that the wood of the broad-leaved trees\r\nis much more complex in structure than that of the conifers. It is by\r\nmeans of the number and distribution of these elements that particular\r\nwoods are identified microscopically. See p. 289.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\n_Ring-porous woods._ Looking thru the microscope at a cross-section of\r\nash, a ring-porous wood, Fig. 20:\r\n\r\n(1) The large round or oval pores or vessels grouped mostly in the\r\nspring wood first attract attention. Smaller ones, but still quite\r\ndistinct, are to be seen scattered all thru the wood. It is by the\r\nnumber and distribution of these pores that the different oak woods\r\nare distinguished, those in white oak being smaller and more numerous,\r\nwhile in red oak they are fewer and larger. It is evident that the\r\ngreater their share in the volume, the lighter in weight and the\r\nweaker will be the wood. In a magnified cross-section of some woods,\r\nas black locust, white elm and chestnut, see Chap. III, beautiful\r\npatterns are to be seen composed of these pores. It is because of the\r\nsize of these pores and their great number that chestnut is so weak.\r\n\r\n(2) The summer wood is also distinguishable by the fact that, as with\r\nthe conifers, its cells are smaller and its cell walls thicker than\r\nthose of the spring wood. The summer wood appears only as a narrow,\r\ndark line along the largest pores in each ring.\r\n\r\n(3) The lines of the pith rays are very plain in some woods, as in\r\noak. No. 47, Chap. III.\r\n\r\n(4) The irregular arrangement and\r\n\r\n(5) Complex structure are evident, and these are due to the fact that\r\nthe wood substance consists of a number of different elements and not\r\none (tracheids) as in the conifers.\r\n\r\nLooking at the radial section, Fig. 20:\r\n\r\n(6) If the piece is oak, the great size of the medullary rays is most\r\nnoticeable. Fig. 32, p. 38. They are often an inch or more wide; that\r\nis, high, as they grow in the tree. In ash they are plain, seen thru\r\nthe microscope, but are not prominent.\r\n\r\n(7) The interweaving of the different fibers and the variety of their\r\nforms show the structure as being very complex.\r\n\r\nIn the tangential section, Fig. 20:\r\n\r\n(8) The pattern of the grain is seen to be marked not so much by\r\nthe denseness of the summer wood as by the presence of the vessels\r\n(pores).\r\n\r\n(9) The ends of the pith rays are also clear.\r\n\r\nIn _diffuse porous woods_, the main features to be noticed are: In the\r\ntransverse section, Fig. 21:\r\n\r\n(1) The irregularity with which the pores are scattered,\r\n\r\n(2) The fine line of dense cells which mark the end of the year's\r\ngrowth,\r\n\r\n(3) The radiating pith rays,\r\n\r\n(4) The irregular arrangement and,\r\n\r\n(5) The complex structure.\r\n\r\nIn the radial section, Fig. 21:\r\n\r\n(6) The pith rays are evident. In sycamore, No. 53, Chap. III, they\r\nare quite large.\r\n\r\n(7) The interweaving of the fibers is to be noted and also their\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nIn the tangential section, Fig. 21:\r\n\r\n(8) The grain is to be traced only dimly, but the fibers are seen to\r\nrun in waves around the pith rays.\r\n\r\n(9) The pith rays, the ends of which are plainly visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAIN OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nThe term \"grain\" is used in a variety of meanings which is likely to\r\ncause confusion. This confusion may be avoided, at least in part,\r\nby distinguishing between grain and texture, using the word grain to\r\nrefer to the arrangement or direction of the wood elements, and the\r\nword texture to refer to their size or quality, so far as these affect\r\nthe structural character of the wood. Hence such qualifying adjectives\r\nas coarse and fine, even and uneven, straight and cross, including\r\nspiral, twisted, wavy, curly, mottled, bird's-eye, gnarly, etc., may\r\nall be applied to grain to give it definite meaning, while to texture\r\nthe proper modifying adjectives are coarse and fine, even and uneven.\r\n\r\nUsually the word grain means the pattern or \"figure\" formed by the\r\ndistinction between the spring wood and the summer wood. If the annual\r\nrings are wide, the wood is, in common usage, called \"coarse grained,\"\r\nif narrow, \"fine grained,\" so that of two trees of the same species,\r\none may be coarse grained and the other fine grained, depending solely\r\non the accident of fast or slow growth.\r\n\r\nThe terms coarse grain and fine grain are also frequently used to\r\ndistinguish such ring-porous woods as have large prominent pores, like\r\nchestnut and ash, from those having small or no pores, as cherry and\r\nlignum vitae. A better expression in this case would be coarse and\r\nfine textured. When such coarse textured woods are stained, the large\r\npores in the spring wood absorb more stain than the smaller elements\r\nin the summer wood, and hence the former part appears darker. In the\r\n\"fine grained\" (or better, fine textured,) woods the pores are absent\r\nor are small and scattered, and the wood is hard, so that they are\r\ncapable of taking a high polish. This indicates the meaning of the\r\nwords coarse and fine in the mind of the cabinet-maker, the reference\r\nbeing primarily to texture.\r\n\r\nIf the elements of which a wood are composed are of approximately\r\nuniform size, it would be said to have a uniform texture, as in\r\nwhite pine, while uniform grain would mean, that the elements, tho\r\nof varying sizes, were evenly distributed, as in the diffuse-porous\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThe term \"grain\" also refers to the regularity of the wood structure.\r\nAn ideal tree would be composed of a succession of regular cones, but\r\nfew trees are truly circular in cross-section and even in those that\r\nare circular, the pith is rarely in the center, showing that one side\r\nof the tree, usually the south side, is better nourished than the\r\nother, Fig. 14, p. 23.\r\n\r\nThe normal direction of the fibers of wood is parallel to the axis of\r\nthe stem in which they grow. Such wood is called \"straight-grained,\"\r\nFig. 22, but there are many deviations from this rule. Whenever the\r\ngrain of the wood in a board is, in whole or in part, oblique to the\r\nsides of the board, it is called \"cross-grained.\" An illustration of\r\nthis is a bend in the fibers, due to a bend in the whole tree or to\r\nthe presence of a neighboring knot. This bend makes the board more\r\ndifficult to plane. In many cases, probably in more cases than not,\r\nthe wood fibers twist around the tree. (See some of the logs in Fig.\r\n107, p. 254.) This produces \"spiral\" or \"twisted\" grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Straight Grained Long-leaf Pine (full size).]\r\n\r\nOften, as in mahogany and sweet gum, the fibers of several layers\r\ntwist first in one direction and then those of the next few layers\r\ntwist the other way, Fig. 24. Such wood is peculiarly cross-grained,\r\nand is of course hard to plane smooth. But when a piece is smoothly\r\nfinished the changing reflection of light from the surface gives a\r\nbeautiful appearance, which can be enhanced by staining and polishing.\r\nIt constitutes the characteristic \"grain\" of striped mahogany, Fig.\r\n23. It is rarely found in the inner part of the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Mahogany, Showing Alternately Twisted Grain\r\n(full size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Spiral Grain in Cypress.\r\n_After Roth._]\r\n\r\nSometimes the grain of wood is \"cross,\" because it is \"wavy\" either in\r\na radial or a tangential section, as in maple, Fig. 25, and Fig. 26.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Planed Surface of Wavy-Grained Maple (full\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Split Surface of Wavy-Grained Maple (full\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\n\"Curly grain\" refers to the figure of circlets and islets and\r\ncontours, often of great beauty, caused by cutting a flat surface in\r\ncrooked-grained wood. See Fig. 27, curly long-leaf pine, and Fig.\r\n28, yellow poplar. When such crookedness is fine and the fibers are\r\ncontorted and, as it were, crowded out of place, as is common in and\r\nnear the roots of trees, the effect is called \"burl,\" Fig. 29. The\r\nterm burl is also used to designate knots and knobs on tree trunks,\r\nFig. 31. Burl is used chiefly in veneers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Curly Grained Long-leaf Pine (full size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Curly Yellow Poplar (full size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Redwood Burl (full size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Bird's-eye Maple (full size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Burl on White Oak.]\r\n\r\nIrregularity of grain is often caused by the presence of adventitious\r\nand dormant buds, which may be plainly seen as little knobs on\r\nthe surface of some trees under the bark. In most trees, these\r\nirregularities are soon buried and smoothed over by the successive\r\nannual layers of wood, but in some woods there is a tendency to\r\npreserve the irregularities. On slash (tangent) boards of such wood,\r\na great number of little circlets appear, giving a beautiful grain,\r\nas in \"Bird's-eye maple,\" Fig. 30. These markings are found to\r\npredominate in the inner part of the tree. This is not at all a\r\ndistinct variety of maple, as is sometimes supposed, but the common\r\nvariety, in which the phenomenon frequently appears. Logs of great\r\nvalue, having bird's-eyes, have often unsuspectingly been chopped up\r\nfor fire wood.\r\n\r\nThe term \"grain\" may also mean the \"figure\" formed by the presence of\r\npith rays, as in oak, Fig. 32, or beech, or the word \"grain\" may refer\r\nsimply to the uneven deposit of coloring matter as is common in sweet\r\ngum, Fig. 33, black ash, or Circassian walnut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Figure Formed by Pith Rays in Oak (full\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Sweet Gum, Showing Uneven Deposit of Coloring\r\nMatter (full size.)]\r\n\r\nThe presence of a limb constitutes a knot and makes great irregularity\r\nin the grain of wood, Fig. 34. In the first place, the fibers on the\r\nupper and lower sides of the limb behave differently, those on the\r\nlower side running uninterruptedly from the stem into the limb,\r\nwhile on the upper side the fibers bend aside making an imperfect\r\nconnection. Consequently to split a knot it is always necessary to\r\nstart the split from the lower side. On the other hand it is easier to\r\nsplit around a knot than thru it. The texture as well as the grain of\r\nwood is modified by the presence of a branch. The wood in and around a\r\nknot is much harder than the main body of the trunk on account of the\r\ncrowding together of the elements. Knots are the remnants of branches\r\nleft in the trunk. These once had all the parts of the trunk itself,\r\nnamely bark, cambium, wood, and pith. Normally, branches grow from the\r\npith, tho some trees, as Jack pine and redwood, among the conifers,\r\nand most of the broad-leaf trees have the power of putting out at any\r\ntime adventitious buds which may develop into branches. When a branch\r\ndies, the annual layer of wood no longer grows upon it, but the\r\nsuccessive layers of wood on the trunk itself close tighter and\r\ntighter around it, until it is broken off. Then, unless it has begun\r\nto decay, it is successively overgrown by annual layers, so that\r\nno sign of it appears until the trunk is cut open. A large trunk\r\nperfectly clean of branches on the outside may have many knots around\r\nits center, remnants of branches which grew there in its youth, as in\r\nFig. 34, and Fig. 8, p. 18. The general effect of the presence of a\r\nknot is, that the fibers that grow around and over it are bent, and\r\nthis, of course, produces crooked grain.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the designations given to different knots by lumbermen:\r\nA _sound_ knot is one which is solid across its face and is as hard as\r\nthe wood surrounding it and fixed in position. A _pin_ knot is sound,\r\nbut not over 1/4\" in diameter. A _standard_ knot is sound, but not\r\nover 1-1/2\" in diameter. A _large_ knot is sound, and over 1-1/2\"\r\nin diameter. A _spike_ knot is one sawn in a lengthwise position. A\r\n_dead_, or, _loose_ knot is one not firmly held in place by growth or\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n(4) _Pith._ At the center or axis of the tree is the pith or\r\n_medulla_, Fig. 34. In every bud, that is, at the apex of every stem\r\nand branch, the pith is the growing part; but as the stem lengthens\r\nand becomes overgrown by successive layers of wood the pith loses its\r\nvital function. It does not grow with the plant except at the buds.\r\nIt varies in thickness, being very small,--hardly more than 1/16\", in\r\ncedar and larch,--and so small in oak as to be hardly discernible;\r\nand what there is of it turns hard and dark. In herbs and shoots it is\r\nrelatively large, Fig. 5, p. 15, in a three-year old shoot of elder,\r\nfor example, being as wide as the wood. In elder, moreover, it dies\r\nearly and pulverizes, leaving the stem hollow. Its function is one of\r\nonly temporary value to the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.

Among these properties are hygroscopicity, shrinkage, weight,\r\nstrength, cleavability, elasticity, hardness, and toughness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYGROSCOPICITY[1] OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that water plays a large part in the economy of the\r\ntree. It occurs in wood in three different ways: In the sap which\r\nfills or partly fills the cavities of the wood cells, in the cell\r\nwalls which it saturates, and in the live protoplasm, of which it\r\nconstitutes 90 per cent. The younger the wood, the more water it\r\ncontains, hence the sap-wood contains much more than the heart-wood,\r\nat times even twice as much.\r\n\r\nIn fresh sap-wood, 60 per cent. of the water is in the cell\r\ncavities, 35 per cent. in the cell walls, and only 5 per cent. in the\r\nprotoplasm. There is so much water in green wood that a sappy pole\r\nwill soon sink when set afloat. The reason why there is much less\r\nwater in heart-wood is because its cells are dead and inactive, and\r\nhence without sap and without protoplasm. There is only what saturates\r\nthe cell walls. Even so, there is considerable water in heart-wood.[2]\r\n\r\nThe lighter kinds have the most water in the sap-wood, thus sycamore\r\nhas more than hickory.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, a tree contains about as much water in winter as\r\nin summer. The water is held there, it is supposed, by capillary\r\nattraction, since the cells are inactive, so that at all times the\r\nwater in wood keeps the cell walls distended.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHRINKAGE OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nWhen a tree is cut down, its water at once begins to evaporate. This\r\nprocess is called \"seasoning.\"[A] In drying, the free water within the\r\ncells keeps the cell walls saturated; but when all the free water has\r\nbeen removed, the cell walls begin to yield up their moisture. Water\r\nwill not flow out of wood unless it is forced out by heat, as when\r\ngreen wood is put on a fire. Ordinarily it evaporates slowly.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: See _Handwork in Wood_, Chapter III.]\r\n\r\nThe water evaporates faster from some kinds of wood than from other\r\nkinds, _e.g._, from white pine than from oak, from small pieces than\r\nfrom large, and from end grain than from a longitudinal section; and\r\nit also evaporates faster in high than in low temperatures.\r\n\r\nEvaporation affects wood in three respects, weight, strength, and\r\nsize. The weight is reduced, the strength is increased, and shrinkage\r\ntakes place. The reduction in weight and increase in strength,\r\nimportant as they are, are of less importance than the shrinkage,\r\nwhich often involves warping and other distortions. The water in wood\r\naffects its size by keeping the cell walls distended.\r\n\r\nIf all the cells of a piece of wood were the same size, and had\r\nwalls the same thickness, and all ran in the same direction, then the\r\nshrinkage would be uniform. But, as we have seen, the structure of\r\nwood is not homogeneous. Some cellular elements are large, some small,\r\nsome have thick walls, some thin walls, some run longitudinally and\r\nsome (the pith rays) run radially. The effects will be various in\r\ndifferently shaped pieces of wood but they can easily be accounted for\r\nif one bears in mind these three facts: (1) that the shrinkage is in\r\nthe cell wall, and therefore (2) that the thick-walled cells shrink\r\nmore than thin-walled cells and (3) that the cells do not shrink much,\r\nif any, lengthwise.\r\n\r\n(1) The shrinkage of wood takes place in the walls of the cells that\r\ncompose it, that is, the cell walls become thinner, as indicated by\r\nthe dotted lines in Fig. 35, which is a cross-section of a single\r\ncell. The diameter of the whole cell becomes less, and the opening, or\r\nlumen, of the cell becomes larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. How Cell Walls Shrink.]\r\n\r\n(2) Thick-walled cells shrink more than thin-walled cells, that is,\r\nsummer cells more than spring cells. This is due to the fact that they\r\ncontain more shrinkable substance. The thicker the wall, the more the\r\nshrinkage.\r\n\r\nConsider the effects of these changes; ordinarily a log when drying\r\nbegins to \"check\" at the end. This is to be explained thus:\r\nInasmuch as evaporation takes place faster from a cross than from a\r\nlongitudinal section, because at the cross-section all the cells are\r\ncut open, it is to be expected that the end of a piece of timber, Fig.\r\n36, A, will shrink first. This would tend to make the end fibers bend\r\ntoward the center of the piece as in B, Fig. 36. But the fibers are\r\nstiff and resist this bending with the result that the end splits or\r\n\"checks\" as in C, Fig. 36. But later, as the rest of the timber dries\r\nout and shrinks, it becomes of equal thickness again and the \"checks\"\r\ntend to close.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. The Shrinkage and Checking at the End of a\r\nBeam.]\r\n\r\n(3) For some reason, which has not been discovered, the cells or\r\nfibers of wood do not shrink in length to any appreciable extent. This\r\nis as true of the cells of pith rays, which run radially in the log,\r\nas of the ordinary cells, which run longitudinally in it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to \"checking\" at the end, logs ordinarily show the effect\r\nof shrinkage by splitting open radially, as in Fig. 37. This is to\r\nbe explained by two factors, (1) the disposition of the pith (or\r\nmedullary) rays, and (2) the arrangement of the wood in annual rings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. The Shrinkage and Splitting of a Log.]\r\n\r\n(1) The cells of the pith rays, as we have seen in Chapter I, run at\r\nright angles to the direction of the mass of wood fibers, and since\r\nthey shrink according to the same laws that other cells do, viz., by\r\nthe cell wall becoming thinner but not shorter, the strain of their\r\nshrinkage is contrary to that of the main cells. The pith rays, which\r\nconsist of a number of cells one above the other, tend to shrink\r\nparallel to the length of the wood, and whatever little longitudinal\r\nshrinkage there is in a board is probably due mostly to the\r\nshrinkage of the pith rays. But because the cells of pith rays do not\r\nappreciably shrink in their length, this fact tends to prevent the\r\nmain body of wood from shrinking radially, and the result is that wood\r\nshrinks less radially than tangentially. Tangentially is the only way\r\nleft for it to shrink. The pith rays may be compared to the ribs of\r\na folding fan, which keep the radius of unaltered length while\r\npermitting comparative freedom for circumferential contraction.\r\n\r\n(2) It is evident that since summer wood shrinks more than spring\r\nwood, this fact will interfere with the even shrinkage of the log.\r\nConsider first the tangential shrinkage. If a section of a single\r\nannual ring of green wood of the shape A B C D, in Fig. 38, is dried\r\nand the mass shrinks according to the thickness of the cell walls,\r\nit will assume the shape A' B' C' D'. When a number of rings together\r\nshrink, the tangential shrinkage of the summer wood tends to contract\r\nthe adjoining rings of spring wood more than they would naturally\r\nshrink of themselves. Since there is more of the summer-wood\r\nsubstance, the spring-wood must yield, and the log shrinks\r\ncircumferentially. The radial shrinkage of the summer-wood, however,\r\nis constantly interrupted by the alternate rows of spring-wood, so\r\nthat there would not be so much radial as circumferential shrinkage.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the tangential or circumferential shrinkage is\r\ntwice as great as the radial shrinkage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Diagram to Show the Greater Shrinkage of\r\nSummer Cells, A, B, than of Spring Cells, C, D.]\r\n\r\nPutting these two factors together, namely, the lengthwise resistance\r\nof the pith rays to the radial shrinkage of the mass of other fibers,\r\nand second, the continuous bands of summer wood, comparatively free to\r\nshrink circumferentially, and the inevitable happens; the log splits.\r\nIf the bark is left on and evaporation hindered, the splits will not\r\nopen so wide.\r\n\r\nThere is still another effect of shrinkage. If, immediately after\r\nfelling, a log is sawn in two lengthwise, the radial splitting may be\r\nlargely avoided, but the flat sides will tend to become convex, as in\r\nFig. 39. This is explained by the fact that circumferential shrinkage\r\nis greater than radial shrinkage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Shrinkage of a Halved Log.]\r\n\r\nIf a log is \"quartered,\"[A] the quarters split still less, as the\r\ninevitable shrinkage takes place more easily. The quarters then\r\ntend to assume the shape shown in Fig. 40, C. If a log is sawed into\r\ntimber, it checks from the center of the faces toward the pith, Fig.\r\n40, D. Sometimes the whole amount of shrinkage may be collected in one\r\nlarge split. When a log is slash-sawed, Fig. 40, I, each board tends\r\nto warp so that the concave side is away from the center of the tree.\r\nIf one plank includes the pith, Fig. 40, E and H, that board will\r\nbecome thinner at its edges than at its center, _i.e._, convex on\r\nboth faces. Other forms assumed by wood in shrinking are shown in Fig.\r\n40. In the cases A-F the explanation is the same; the circumferential\r\nshrinkage is more than the radial. In J and K the shapes are accounted\r\nfor by the fact that wood shrinks very little longitudinally.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: See _Handwork in Wood_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Shapes Assumed by Wood in Shrinking.]\r\n\r\nWarping is uneven shrinkage, one side of the board contracting\r\nmore than the other. Whenever a slash board warps under ordinary\r\nconditions, the convex side is the one which was toward the center of\r\nthe tree. However, a board may be made to warp artificially the other\r\nway by applying heat to the side of the board toward the center of the\r\ntree, and by keeping the other side moist. The board will warp only\r\nsidewise; lengthwise it remains straight unless the treatment is very\r\nsevere. This shows again that water distends the cells laterally but\r\nnot longitudinally.\r\n\r\nThe thinning of the cell walls due to evaporation, is thus seen\r\nto have three results, all included in the term \"working,\" viz.:\r\n_shrinkage_, a diminution in size, _splitting_, due to the inability\r\nof parts to cohere under the strains to which they are subjected, and\r\n_warping_, or uneven shrinkage.\r\n\r\nIn order to neutralize warping as much as possible in broad board\r\nstructures, it is common to joint the board with the annual rings\r\nof each alternate board curving in opposite directions, as shown in\r\n_Handwork in Wood_, Fig. 280, _a_, p. 188.\r\n\r\nUnder warping is included bowing. Bowing, that is, bending in the form\r\nof a bow, is, so to speak, longitudinal warping. It is largely due to\r\ncrookedness or irregularity of grain, and is likely to occur in boards\r\nwith large pith rays, as oak and sycamore. But even a straight-grained\r\npiece of wood, left standing on end or subjected to heat on one side\r\nand dampness on the other, will bow, as, for instance a board lying on\r\nthe damp ground and in the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. _a_, Star Shakes; _b_, Heart Shakes; _c_, Cup\r\nShakes or Ring Shakes; _d_, Honeycombing.]\r\n\r\nSplitting takes various names, according to its form in the tree.\r\n\"Check\" is a term used for all sorts of cracks, and more particularly\r\nfor a longitudinal crack in timber. \"Shakes\" are splits of various\r\nforms as: _star shakes_, Fig. 41, _a_, splits which radiate from the\r\npith along the pith rays and widen outward; _heart shakes_, Fig. 41,\r\n_b_, splits crossing the central rings and widening toward the center;\r\nand _cup_ or _ring shakes_, Fig. 41, _c_, splits between the annual\r\nrings. _Honeycombing_, Fig. 41, _d_, is splitting along the pith rays\r\nand is due largely to case hardening.\r\n\r\nThese are not all due to shrinkage in drying, but may occur in the\r\ngrowing tree from various harmful causes. See p. 232.\r\n\r\nWood that has once been dried may again be swelled to nearly if not\r\nfully its original size, by being soaked in water or subjected to wet\r\nsteam. This fact is taken advantage of in wetting wooden wedges\r\nto split some kinds of soft stone. The processes of shrinking and\r\nswelling can be repeated indefinitely, and no temperature short of\r\nburning, completely prevents wood from shrinking and swelling.\r\n\r\nRapid drying of wood tends to \"case harden\" it, _i.e._, to dry and\r\nshrink the outer part before the inside has had a chance to do the\r\nsame. This results in checking separately both the outside and the\r\ninside, hence special precautions need to be taken in the seasoning of\r\nwood to prevent this. When wood is once thoroly bent out of shape in\r\nshrinking, it is very difficult to straighten it again.\r\n\r\nWoods vary considerably in the amounts of their shrinkage. The\r\nconifers with their regular structure shrink less and shrink more\r\nevenly than the broad-leaved woods.[3] Wood, even after it has been\r\nwell seasoned, is subject to frequent changes in volume due to the\r\nvarying amount of moisture in the atmosphere. This involves constant\r\ncare in handling it and wisdom in its use. These matters are\r\nconsidered in _Handwork in Wood_, Chapter III, on the Seasoning of\r\nWood.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEIGHT OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nWood substance itself is heavier than water, as can readily be proved\r\nby immersing a very thin cross-section of pine in water. Since the\r\ncells are cut across, the water readily enters the cavities, and\r\nthe wood being heavier than the water, sinks. In fact, it is the air\r\nenclosed in the cell cavities that ordinarily keeps wood afloat, just\r\nas it does a corked empty bottle, altho glass is heavier than water.\r\nA longitudinal shaving of pine will float longer than a cross shaving\r\nfor the simple reason that it takes longer for the water to penetrate\r\nthe cells, and a good sized white pine log would be years in getting\r\nwater-soaked enough to sink. As long as a majority of the cells are\r\nfilled with air it would float.\r\n\r\nIn any given piece of wood, then, the weight is determined by\r\ntwo factors, the amount of wood substance and the amount of water\r\ncontained therein. The amount of wood substance is constant, but the\r\namount of water contained is variable, and hence the weight varies\r\naccordingly. Moreover, considering the wood substance alone, the\r\nweight of wood substance of different kinds of wood is about the same;\r\nnamely, 1.6 times as heavy as water, whether it is oak or pine, ebony\r\nor poplar. The reason why a given bulk of some woods is lighter than\r\nan equal bulk of others, is because there are more thin-walled and\r\nair-filled cells in the light woods. Many hard woods, as lignum vitae,\r\nare so heavy that they will not float at all. This is because the wall\r\nof the wood cells is very thick, and the lumina are small.\r\n\r\nIn order, then, to find out the comparative weights of different\r\nwoods, that is, to see how much wood substance there is in a given\r\nvolume of any wood, it is necessary to test absolutely dry specimens.\r\n\r\nThe weight of wood is indicated either as the weight per cubic foot or\r\nas specific gravity.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that different parts of the same tree have\r\ndifferent weights, the wood at the base of the tree weighing more than\r\nthat higher up, and the wood midway between the pith and bark weighing\r\nmore than either the center or the outside.[4]\r\n\r\nThe weight of wood has a very important bearing upon its use. A\r\nmallet-head, for example, needs weight in a small volume, but it\r\nmust also be tough to resist shocks, and elastic so as to impart its\r\nmomentum gradually and not all at once, as an iron head does.\r\n\r\nWeight is important, too, in objects of wood that are movable. The\r\nlighter the wood the better, if it is strong enough. That is why\r\nspruce is valuable for ladders; it is both light and strong. Chestnut\r\nwould be a valuable wood for furniture if it were not weak, especially\r\nin the spring wood.\r\n\r\nThe weight of wood is one measure of its strength. Heavy wood is\r\nstronger than light wood of the same kind, for the simple reason that\r\nweight and strength are dependent upon the number and compactness of\r\nthe fibers.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRENGTH OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nStrength is a factor of prime importance in wood. By strength is meant\r\nthe ability to resist stresses, either of tension (pulling), or\r\nof compression (pushing), or both together, cross stresses. When a\r\nhorizontal timber is subjected to a downward cross stress, the lower\r\nhalf is under tension, the upper half is under compression and the\r\nline between is called the neutral axis, Fig. 42.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. A Timber Under Cross Stress, Showing Neutral\r\nAxis, and the Lines of Tension and Compression. A knot occurring in\r\nsuch a timber should be in the upper half, as at A.]\r\n\r\nWood is much stronger than is commonly supposed. A hickory bar will\r\nstand more strain under tension than a wrought iron bar of the same\r\nlength and weight, and a block of long-leaf pine a greater compression\r\nendwise than a block of wrought iron of the same height and weight. It\r\napproaches the strength of cast iron under the same conditions.\r\n\r\nStrength depends on two factors: the strength of the individual\r\nfibers, and the adhesive power of the fibers to each other. So, when\r\na piece of wood is pulled apart, some of the fibers break and some are\r\npulled out from among their neighbors. Under compression, however,\r\nthe fibers seem to act quite independently of each other, each bending\r\nover like the strands of a rope when the ends are pushed together. As\r\na consequence, we find that wood is far stronger under tension than\r\nunder compression, varying from two to four times.\r\n\r\nWoods do not vary nearly so much under compression as under tension,\r\nthe straight-grained conifers, like larch and longleaf pine, being\r\nnearly as strong under compression as the hard woods, like hickory and\r\nelm, which have entangled fibers, whereas the hard woods are nearly\r\ntwice as strong as the conifers under tension.\r\n\r\nMoisture has more effect on the strength of wood than any other\r\nextrinsic condition. In sound wood under ordinary conditions, it\r\noutweighs all other causes which affect strength. When thoroly\r\nseasoned, wood is two or three times stronger, both under compression\r\nand in bending, than when green or water soaked.[6]\r\n\r\nThe tension or pulling strength of wood is much affected by the\r\ndirection of the grain, a cross-grained piece being only 1/10th to\r\n1/20th as strong as a straight-grained piece. But under compression\r\nthere is not much difference; so that if a timber is to be subjected\r\nto cross strain, that is the lower half under tension and the upper\r\nhalf under compression, a knot or other cross-grained portion should\r\nbe in the upper half.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Shearing Strength is Measured by the Adhesion\r\nof the Portion A, B, C, D or to the Wood on both sides of it.]\r\n\r\nStrength also includes the ability to resist shear. This is called\r\n\"_shearing strength_.\" It is a measure of the adhesion of one part of\r\nthe wood to an adjoining part. Shearing is what takes place when the\r\nportion of wood beyond a mortise near the end of a timber, A B C D,\r\nFig. 43, is forced out by the tenon. In this case it would be shearing\r\nalong the grain, sometimes called detrusion. The resistance of the\r\nportion A B C D, _i.e._, its power of adhesion to the wood adjacent\r\nto it on both sides, is its shearing strength. If the mortised piece\r\nwere forced downward until it broke off the tenon at the shoulder,\r\nthat would be shearing across the grain. The shearing resistance\r\neither with or across the grain is small compared with tension and\r\ncompression. Green wood shears much more easily than dry, because\r\nmoisture softens the wood and this reduces the adhesion of the fibers\r\nto each other.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAVABILITY OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with shearing strength is cohesion, a property\r\nusually considered under the name of its opposite, cleavability,\r\n_i.e._, the ease of splitting.\r\n\r\nWhen an ax is stuck into the end of a piece of wood, the wood splits\r\nin advance of the ax edge. See _Handwork in Wood_, Fig. 59, p. 52. The\r\nwood is not cut but pulled across the grain just as truly as if one\r\nedge were held and a weight were attached to the other edge and it\r\nwere torn apart by tension. The length of the cleft ahead of the blade\r\nis determined by the elasticity of the wood. The longer the cleft, the\r\neasier to split. Elasticity helps splitting, and shearing strength and\r\nhardness hinder it.\r\n\r\nA normal piece of wood splits easily along two surfaces, (1) along any\r\nradial plane, principally because of the presence of the pith rays,\r\nand, in regular grained wood like pine, because the cells are radially\r\nregular; and (2) along the annual rings, because the spring-wood\r\nseparates easily from the next ring of summer-wood. Of the two, radial\r\ncleavage is 50 to 100 per cent. easier. Straight-grained wood is\r\nmuch easier to split than cross-grained wood in which the fibers are\r\ninterlaced, and soft wood, provided it is elastic, splits easier than\r\nhard. Woods with sharp contrast between spring and summer wood, like\r\nyellow pine and chestnut, split very easily tangentially.\r\n\r\nAll these facts are important in relation to the use of nails. For\r\ninstance, the reason why yellow pine is hard to nail and bass easy is\r\nbecause of their difference in cleavability.\r\n\r\n\r\nELASTICITY OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nElasticity is the ability of a substance when forced out of\r\nshape,--bent, twisted, compressed or stretched, to regain its former\r\nshape. When the elasticity of wood is spoken of, its ability to spring\r\nback from bending is usually meant. The opposite of elasticity is\r\nbrittleness. Hickory is elastic, white pine is brittle.\r\n\r\nStiffness is the ability to resist bending, and hence is the opposite\r\nof pliability or flexibility. A wood may be both stiff and elastic; it\r\nmay be even stiff and pliable, as ash, which may be made into splints\r\nfor baskets and may also be used for oars. Willow sprouts are flexible\r\nwhen green, but quite brittle when dry.\r\n\r\nElasticity is of great importance in some uses of wood, as in long\r\ntool handles used in agricultural implements, such as rakes, hoes,\r\nscythes, and in axes, in archery bows, in golf sticks, etc., in all of\r\nwhich, hickory, our most elastic wood, is used.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDNESS OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nHardness is the ability of wood to resist indentations, and depends\r\nprimarily upon the thickness of the cell walls and the smallness\r\nof the cell cavities, or, in general, upon the density of the wood\r\nstructure. Summer wood, as we have seen, is much harder than spring\r\nwood, hence it is important in using such wood as yellow pine on\r\nfloors to use comb-grain boards, so as to present the softer spring\r\nwood in as narrow surfaces as possible. See _Handwork in Wood_, p. 41,\r\nand Fig. 55. In slash-grain boards, broad surfaces of both spring\r\nand summer wood appear. Maple which is uniformly hard makes the best\r\nfloors, even better than oak, parts of which are comparatively soft.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of wood is of much consequence in gluing pieces together.\r\nSoft woods, like pine, can be glued easily, because the fibers can\r\nbe forced close together. As a matter of fact, the joint when dry is\r\nstronger than the rest of the board. In gluing hard woods, however, it\r\nis necessary to scratch the surfaces to be glued in order to insure a\r\nstrong joint. It is for the same reason that a joint made with liquid\r\nglue is safe on soft wood when it would be weak on hard wood.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUGHNESS OF WOOD.\r\n\r\nToughness may be defined as the ability to resist sudden shocks and\r\nblows. This requires a combination of various qualities, strength,\r\nhardness, elasticity and pliability. The tough woods, _par\r\nexcellence_, are hickory, rock elm and ash. They can be pounded,\r\npulled, compressed and sheared. It is because of this quality that\r\nhickory is used for wheel spokes and for handles, elm for hubs, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of wood for particular purposes, it is sometimes one,\r\nsometimes another, and more often still, a combination of qualities\r\nthat makes it fit for use.[10]\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that it was knowledge of the special values\r\nof different woods that made \"the one horse shay,\" \"The Deacon's\r\nMasterpiece.\"\r\n\r\n  \"So the Deacon inquired of the village folk\r\n  Where he could find the strongest oak,\r\n  That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,--\r\n  That was for spokes and floor and sills;\r\n  He sent for lancewood to make the thills;\r\n  The cross bars were ash, from the straightest trees,\r\n  The panels of whitewood, that cuts like cheese,\r\n  But lasts like iron for things like these.\r\n  The hubs of logs from the \"Settler's Ellum,\"--\r\n  Last of its timber,--they couldn't sell 'em.\r\n  Never an ax had seen their chips,\r\n  And the wedges flew from between their lips,\r\n  Their blunt ends frizzled like celery tips;\r\n  Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,\r\n  Spring, tire, axle and linch pin too,\r\n  Steel of the finest, bright and blue;\r\n  Thorough brace, bison skin, thick and wide;\r\n  Boot, top dasher from tough old hide,\r\n  Found in the pit when the tanner died.\r\n  That was the way to \"put her through.\"\r\n  'There!' said the Deacon, 'naow she'll dew!'\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Hygroscopicity, \"the property possessed by\r\n    vegetable tissues of absorbing or discharging moisture and\r\n    expanding or shrinking accordingly.\"--_Century Dictionary._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: This is shown by the following table, from\r\n    Forestry Bulletin No. 10, p. 31, _Timber_, by Filibert Roth:\r\n\r\n    POUNDS OF WATER LOST IN DRYING 100 POUNDS OF GREEN WOOD IN THE KILN.\r\n\r\n                                                Sap-wood or  Heart-wood\r\n                                                outer part.  or interior.\r\n\r\n    1.

S. Forest Bulletin No. 17, Sudworth's\r\n_Check List of the Forest Trees of the United States_, the complicated\r\nrules for the capitalization of the names of species are abandoned and\r\nthey are uniformly not capitalized.\r\n\r\nOn pages 192-195 will be found lists of the woods described, arranged\r\nin the order of their comparative weight, strength, elasticity, and\r\nhardness. These lists are based upon the figures in Sargent's _The\r\nJesup Collection_.\r\n\r\nIn the appendix, p. 289, will be found a key for distinguishing the\r\nvarious kinds of wood.\r\n\r\nInformation as to current wholesale prices in the principal markets of\r\nthe country can be had from the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, The Forest\r\nService, Washington, D. C., _Record of Wholesale Prices of Lumber,\r\nList A._ These lists are published periodically. No attempt is made in\r\nthis book to give prices because: (1) only lists of wholesale prices\r\nare available; (2) the cuts and grades differ considerably, especially\r\nin soft woods (conifers); (3) prices are constantly varying; (4) the\r\nprices differ much in different localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nWHITE PINE, WEYMOUTH PINE.\r\n\r\n    Named for Lord Weymouth, who cultivated it in England.\r\n\r\n_Pinus strobus_ Linnaeus.\r\n\r\n    _Pinus_, the classical Latin name; _strobus_ refers to the\r\n    cone, or strobile, from a Greek word, _strobus_, meaning\r\n    twist.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Habitat.]\r\n\r\nHABITAT: (See map); now best in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE TREE: Height, 100'-120', even 200'; diameter,\r\n2'-4'; branches in whorls, cleans poorly; bark, dark gray, divided by\r\ndeep longitudinal fissures into broad ridges; leaves in clusters of 5,\r\n3\"-5\" long; cone drooping, 4\"-10\" long.\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE OF WOOD: Color, heart-wood, very light brown, almost cream\r\ncolor, sap-wood, nearly white; non-porous; rings, fine but distinct;\r\ngrain, straight; pith rays, very faint; resin ducts, small,\r\ninconspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaf.]\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL QUALITIES: Weight, very light (59th in this list); 27 lbs.\r\nper cu. ft.; sp. gr. 0.3854; strength, medium (55th in this list);\r\nelasticity, medium (47th in this list); soft (57th in this list);\r\nshrinkage 3 per cent.; warps very little; durability, moderate; works\r\neasily in every way; splits easily but nails well.\r\n\r\nCOMMON USES: Doors, window sashes and other carpentry, pattern-making,\r\ncabinet-work, matches.\r\n\r\nREMARKS: This best of American woods is now rapidly becoming scarce\r\nand higher in price.

The so-called Spanish mahogany, the most\r\nhighly prized variety, came originally from the south of Hayti. The\r\nHonduras Mahogany was often called baywood. Botanically the varieties\r\nare not carefully distinguished; in the lumber yard the lumber is\r\nknown by its sources. The Cuba wood can be partly distinguished by the\r\nwhite chalk-like specks in the pores and is cold to the touch, while\r\nthe Honduras wood can be recognized by the black specks or lines in\r\nthe grain. Both the Honduras and West India woods have a softer feel\r\nthan the African wood, when rubbed with the thumb. The Cuba and St.\r\nDomingo wood are preferred to the Honduras, and still more to the\r\nAfrican, but even experts have difficulty in distinguishing the\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nSpanish cedar, or furniture cedar (_Cedrela odorata_) belongs to\r\nthe same family as mahogany and is often sold for it. It is softer,\r\nlighter, and easier to work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Radial Section, life size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tangential Section, life size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\nOREGON MAPLE. WHITE MAPLE.

These are separated by the great\r\ntreeless plains which are west of the Mississippi River, and east of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and which extend from North Dakota to western\r\nTexas.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Forest Regions of the United States. _U. S.\r\nForest Service._]\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Forest once consisted of an almost unbroken mass, lying in\r\nthree quite distinct regions, (1) the northern belt of conifers, (2)\r\nthe southern belt of conifers, and (3) the great deciduous (hardwood)\r\nforest lying between these two.\r\n\r\n(1) The northern belt of conifers or \"North Woods\" extended\r\nthru northern New England and New York and ran south along the\r\nAppalachians. It reappeared again in northern Michigan, Wisconsin and\r\nMinnesota. White pine, Fig. 45, was the characteristic tree in the\r\neastern part of this belt, tho spruce was common, Fig. 56, p. 213,\r\nand white and Norway pine and hemlock distinguished it in the western\r\npart. Altho the more valuable timber, especially the pine, has been\r\ncut out, it still remains a largely unbroken forest mainly of spruce,\r\nsecond growth pine, hemlock and some hardwood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. Interior of Dense White Pine Forest, Cass\r\nLake, Minn. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n(2) The southern pine forest formerly extended from the Potomac River\r\nin a belt from one to two hundred miles wide along the Atlantic coast,\r\nacross the Florida peninsula, and along the gulf of Mexico, skipping\r\nthe Mississippi River and reappearing in a great forest in Louisiana\r\nand Eastern Texas. It was composed of almost pure stands of pine, the\r\nlong-leaf, Fig. 46, the short-leaf, and the loblolly, with cypress\r\nin the swamps and bottom lands. In southern Florida the forest is\r\ntropical, Fig. 47, like that of the West Indies, and in southern Texas\r\nit partakes of the character of the Mexican forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. Long-leaf Pine Forest. Oscilla, Georgia. _U.\r\nS. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. Semi-tropical Forest, Florida. Live Oak,\r\nSurrounded by Cabbage Palmetto, and Hung With Spanish Moss. _U. S.\r\nForest Service._]\r\n\r\n(3) Between these north and south coniferous belts, lay the great\r\nbroad-leaf or hardwood forest, Fig. 48, which constituted the greater\r\npart of the Eastern Forest and characterized it. It was divided into\r\ntwo parts by an irregular northeast and southwest line, running from\r\nsouthern New England to Missouri. The southeast portion consisted\r\nof hardwoods intermixed with conifers. The higher ridges of the\r\nAppalachian Range, really a leg of the northern forest, were occupied\r\nby conifers, mainly spruce, white pine, and hemlock. The northwest\r\nportion of the region, particularly Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, was\r\nwithout the conifers. It was essentially a mixed forest, largely oak,\r\nwith a variable mixture of maples, beech, chestnut, yellow poplar,\r\nhickory, sycamore, elm, and ash, with birch appearing toward the north\r\nand pine toward the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. Broad-leaf Forest, Protected from Cattle and\r\nFire. Hancock Co., Indiana. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nTaking the Eastern Forest as a whole, its most distinguishing feature\r\nwas the prevalence of broad-leaved trees, so that it might properly be\r\ncalled a deciduous forest. The greatest diversity of trees was to be\r\nfound in Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina, and this region is\r\nstill the source of the best hardwood lumber.\r\n\r\nThis great eastern forest, which once extended uninterruptedly from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Mississippi and beyond, has now been largely\r\nlumbered off, particularly thru the middle or hardwood portion, making\r\nway for farms and towns. The north and south coniferous belts are\r\nstill mainly unbroken, and are sparsely settled, but the big timber\r\nis cut out, giving place to poorer trees. This is particularly true of\r\nthe white pine, \"the king of American trees,\" only a little of which,\r\nin valuable sizes, is left in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In\r\nthe same way in the south, the long-leaf pine, once the characteristic\r\ntree, is fast being lumbered out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. Irrigated Ranch on Treeless Alkali Plain. Rio\r\nBlanco Co., Colorada. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nThe Western or Pacific forest extends two great legs, one down the\r\nRocky Mountain Range, and the other along the Pacific coast. Between\r\nthem lies the great treeless alkali plain centering around Nevada,\r\nFig. 49. In these two regions coniferous trees have almost a monopoly.\r\nBroad-leaved trees are to be found there, along the river beds and in\r\nravines, but they are of comparatively little importance. The forest\r\nis essentially an evergreen forest. Another marked feature of this\r\nwestern forest, except in the Puget Sound region, is that the trees,\r\nin many cases, stand far apart, their crowns not even touching, so\r\nthat the sun beats down and dries up the forest floor, Fig. 50.\r\nThere is no dense \"forest cover\" or canopy as in the Eastern Forest.\r\nMoreover these western forests are largely broken up, covering but a\r\npart of the mountains, many of which are snow-clad, and interrupted\r\nby bare plains. Along the creeks there grow a variety of hardwoods. It\r\nwas never a continuous forest as was the Eastern Forest. The openness\r\nof this forest on the Rockies and on the eastern slopes of the Sierra\r\nNevadas is in marked contrast to the western slopes of the Sierras,\r\nwhere there are to be seen the densest and most remarkable woods of\r\nthe world, Fig. 51. This is due to the peculiar distribution of the\r\nrainfall of the region. The precipitation of the moisture upon the\r\nnorthwest coast where the trees are dripping with fog a large part of\r\nthe time, is unequaled by that of any other locality on the continent.\r\nBut the interior of this region, which is shut off by the high\r\nSierra Nevadas from the western winds, has a very light and irregular\r\nrainfall. Where the rainfall is heavy, the forests are dense; and\r\nwhere the rainfall is light, the trees are sparse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. Open Western Forest, Bull Pine. Flagstaff,\r\nArizona. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nAlong the Rockies the characteristic trees are Engelmann's spruce,\r\nbull pine, Douglas fir, and lodgepole pine. As one goes west, the\r\nvariety of trees increases and becomes, so far as conifers are\r\nconcerned, far greater than in the east. Of 109 conifers in the United\r\nStates, 80 belong to the western forests and 28 to the eastern. The\r\nPacific forest is rich in the possession of half a dozen leading\r\nspecies--Douglas fir, western hemlock, sugar pine, bull pine, cedar\r\nand redwood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. Dense Forest of Puget Sound Region, Red Fir\r\nand Red Cedar. Pierce Co., Washington. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nBut the far western conifers are remarkable, not only for their\r\nvariety, but still more for the density of their growth, already\r\nmentioned, and for their great size, Fig. 52. The pines, spruces and\r\nhemlocks of the Puget Sound region make eastern trees look small, and\r\nboth the red fir and the redwood often grow to be over 250 feet high,\r\nand yield 100,000 feet, B.M., to the acre as against 10,000 feet,\r\nB.M., of good spruce in Maine. The redwood, Fig. 53, occupies a belt\r\nsome twenty miles wide along the coast from southern Oregon to a point\r\nnot far north of San Francisco and grows even taller than the famous\r\nbig trees.

A considerable\r\nnumber of genera, perhaps a third of the total, grow within both\r\nregions, but the species having continental range are few.

It may almost be said to have a life of its own, since\r\nit has a soil and a climate, largely of its own making.\r\n\r\nWithout these conditions, and without the help and hindrance which\r\nforest trees give to each other, these trees would not have their\r\npresent characteristics, either in shape, habits of growth or nature\r\nof wood grain. Indeed, some of them could not live at all.\r\n\r\nSince by far the greater number of timber trees grow in the forest, in\r\norder to understand the facts about trees and woods, it is necessary\r\nto know something about the conditions of forest life.\r\n\r\nA tree is made up of three distinct parts: (1) the roots which anchor\r\nit in the ground, and draw its nourishment from the moist soil; (2)\r\nthe trunk, or bole, or stem, which carries the weight of the branches\r\nand leaves, and conveys the nourishment to and from the leaves; (3)\r\nthe crown, composed of the leaves, the branches on which they hang,\r\nand the buds at the ends of the branches. As trees stand together in\r\nthe forest, their united crowns make a sort of canopy or cover, Fig.\r\n55, which, more than anything, determines the factors affecting\r\nforest life, viz., the soil, the temperature, the moisture, and most\r\nimportant of all, the light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. The Forest Cover. Spruce Forest, Bavaria,\r\nGermany. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, every species of tree has its own requirements\r\nin respect to these very factors of temperature,--moisture, soil and\r\nlight. These are called its _silvical characteristics_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL.\r\n\r\nSome trees, as black walnut, flourish on good soil, supplanting others\r\nbecause they are better able to make use of the richness of the soil;\r\nwhile some trees occupy poor soil because they alone are able to live\r\nthere at all. Spruce, Fig. 56, will grow in the north woods on such\r\npoor soil that it has no competitors, and birches, too, will grow\r\nanywhere in the north woods. In general, it is true that mixed\r\nforests, Fig. 57, _i.e._, those having a variety of species, grow on\r\ngood loamy soil. The great central, deciduous Atlantic Forest grew on\r\nsuch soil until it was removed to make room for farms. On the other\r\nhand, pure stands--_i.e._, forests made up of single varieties--of\r\npine occupy poor sandy soil. Within a distance of a few yards in the\r\nmidst of a pure stand of pine in the south, a change in the soil will\r\nproduce a dense mixed growth of broad-leaves and conifers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. Virgin Stand of Red Spruce. White Mountains,\r\nNew Hampshire. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. Typical Mixed Forest,--Red Spruce, Hemlock,\r\nWhite Ash, Yellow Birch, Balsam Fir, and Red Maple. Raquette Lake, New\r\nYork. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nThe soil in the forest is largely determined by the forest itself. In\r\naddition to the earth, it is composed of the fallen and decayed leaves\r\nand twigs and tree trunks, altogether called the _forest floor_. It is\r\nspongy and hence has the ability to retain moisture, a fact of great\r\nimportance to the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE.\r\n\r\nSome trees, as black ash and cypress, Fig. 58, and cotton gum, Fig.\r\n59, grow naturally only in moist places; some, as the pinon and\r\nmesquite, a kind of locust, grow only in dry places; while others,\r\nas the juniper and Douglas fir, adapt themselves to either. Both\r\nexcessively wet and dry soils tend to diminish the number of kinds\r\nof trees. In many instances the demand for water controls the\r\ndistribution altogether. In the Puget Sound region, where there is a\r\nheavy rain-fall, the densest forests in the world are found, whereas\r\non the eastern slopes of the same mountains, altho the soil is not\r\nessentially different, there are very few trees, because of the\r\nconstant drouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. Cypress and Cypress \"Knees.\" Jasper Co.,\r\nTexas. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. Cotton Gums, Showing Buttresses. St. Francis\r\nRiver, Arkansas. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe fact that some trees, as paper birch and white spruce, grow only\r\nin cold regions, and some, as rubber trees and cypress, only in the\r\ntropics, is commonplace; but a fact not so well known is that it is\r\nnot the average temperature, but the extremes which largely determine\r\nthe habitat of trees of different kinds. Trees which would not live\r\nat all where there is frost, might flourish well in a region where\r\nthe average temperature was considerably lower. On the other hand,\r\nprovided the growing season is long enough for the species, there is\r\nno place on earth too cold for trees to live. Fig. 60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Northern Forest,--Young Spruce Growing Under\r\nYellow Birch. Santa Clara, New York. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nIn general, cold affects the forest just as poor soil and drought do,\r\nsimplifying its composition and stunting its growth. In Canada there\r\nare only a few kinds of trees, of which the hardwoods are stunted;\r\nsouth of the Great Lakes, there is a great variety of large trees;\r\nfarther south in the southern Appalachian region, there is a still\r\ngreater variety, and the trees are just as large; and still farther\r\nsouth in tropical Florida, there is the greatest variety of all. The\r\nslopes of a high mountain furnish an illustration of the effect of\r\ntemperature. In ascending it, one may pass from a tropical forest at\r\nthe base, thru a belt of evergreen, broad-leaved trees, then thru a\r\nbelt of deciduous broad-leaved trees, then thru a belt of conifers and\r\nup to the timber line where tree life ceases. Figs. 61, and 62.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Mixed Hardwoods on Lower Levels. Spruce\r\nand Balsam Dominate on Higher Elevations. Mt. McIntyre, Adirondack\r\nMountains, New York. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Scrub Growth on Mountain Top. Mt. Webster, New\r\nHampshire. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT.\r\n\r\nMore than by any other factor, the growth of trees in a forest is\r\ndetermined by the effect of light. All trees need light sooner or\r\nlater, but some trees have much more ability than others to grow\r\nin the shade when young. Such trees, of which maple and spruce are\r\nexamples, are called _tolerant_, while others, for instance, larch,\r\nwhich will endure only a comparatively thin cover or none at all, are\r\ncalled _intolerant_. The leaves of tolerant trees endure shade well,\r\nso that their inner and lower leaves flourish under the shadow of\r\ntheir upper and outer leaves, with the result that the whole tree,\r\nas beech and maple, makes a dense shadow; whereas the leaves of\r\nintolerant trees are either sparse, as in the larch, or are so hung\r\nthat the light sifts thru them, as in poplar and oak. The spruces and\r\nbalsam fir have the remarkable power of growing slowly under heavy\r\nshade for many years, and then of growing vigorously when the light is\r\nlet in by the fall of their overshadowing neighbors. This can plainly\r\nbe seen in the cross-section of balsam fir, Fig. 63, where the narrow\r\nannual rings of the early growth, are followed by the wider ones of\r\nlater growth. A common sight in the dense woods is the maple sending\r\nup a long, spindly stem thru the trees about it and having at its top\r\na little tuft of leaves, Fig. 64. By so doing it survives. The fact\r\nthat a tree can grow without shade often determines its possession\r\nof a burnt-over tract. The order in the North Woods after a fire\r\nis commonly, first, a growth of fire weed, then raspberries or\r\nblackberries, then aspen, a very intolerant tree whose light shade\r\nin turn permits under it the growth of the spruce, to which it is a\r\n\"nurse,\" Fig. 65. In general it may be said that all seedling conifers\r\nrequire some shade the first two years, while hardwoods in temperate\r\nclimates, as a rule, do not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63. Cross section of Balsam Fir, Showing Fast\r\nGrowth After Years of Suppression. Notice the width of the annual\r\nrings in later age compared with early. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. Tolerant Maple. The trees are too slender to\r\nstand alone. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. Intolerant Aspen, a \"nurse\" of Tolerant\r\nSpruce._ U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nThis matter of tolerance has also much to do with the branching of\r\ntrees. The leaves on the lower branches of an intolerant tree will not\r\nthrive, with the result that those branches die and later drop off.\r\nThis is called \"cleaning,\" or natural pruning. Intolerant trees, like\r\naspen and tulip, Fig. 66, clean themselves well and hence grow with\r\nlong, straight boles, while tolerant trees, like spruce and fir,\r\nretain their branches longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. Intolerant Tulip. Notice the long, straight\r\nboles. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of a species may also be determined by geographical\r\nbarriers, like mountain ranges and oceans. This is why the western\r\nforests differ radically from the eastern forests and why the forest\r\nof Australasia is sharply distinct from any other forest in the world.\r\n\r\nAny one or several of these factors, soil, moisture, heat, and light,\r\nmay be the determining factor in the make-up of a forest, or it may\r\nbe that a particular tree may survive, because of a faster rate of\r\ngrowth, thus enabling it to overtop its fellows and cut off their\r\nlight. The struggle for survival is constant, and that tree survives\r\nwhich can take the best advantage of the existent conditions.\r\n\r\nBesides these topographical and climatic factors which help determine\r\nthe distribution of trees, a very important factor is the historical\r\none. For example, the only reason by which the location of the few\r\nisolated groves of big trees in California can be accounted for is the\r\nrise and fall of glacial sheets, which left them, as it were, islands\r\nstranded in a sea of ice. As the glaciers retreated, the region\r\ngradually became re-forested, those trees coming up first which were\r\nbest able to take advantage of the conditions, whether due to the\r\ncharacter of their seeds, their tolerance, their endurance of moisture\r\nor whatever. This process is still going on and hardwoods are probably\r\ngaining ground.\r\n\r\nBesides these external factors which determine the composition and\r\norganic life of the forest, the trees themselves furnish an important\r\nfactor in their methods of reproduction. These, in general, are two,\r\n(1) by sprouts, and (2) by seeds.\r\n\r\n(1) Most conifers have no power of sprouting. The chief exceptions\r\nare pitch pine and, to a remarkable degree, the redwood, Fig. 67. This\r\npower, however, is common in broad-leaved trees, as may be seen after\r\na fire has swept thru second growth, hardwood timber. Altho all the\r\nyoung trees are killed down to the ground, the young sprouts spring\r\nup from the still living roots. This may happen repeatedly. Coppice\r\nwoods, as of chestnut and oak, which sprout with great freedom, are\r\nthe result of this ability. The wood is poor so that it is chiefly\r\nused for fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. Sprouting Redwood Stumps. Glen Blair, Calif.\r\n_U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n(2) Most trees, however, are reproduced by seeds. Trees yield these\r\nin great abundance, to provide for waste,--nature's method. Many seeds\r\nnever ripen, many perish, many are eaten by animals, many fall on\r\nbarren ground or rocks, and many sprout, only to die. The weight of\r\nseeds has much to do with their distribution. Heavy seeds like acorns,\r\nchestnuts, hickory and other nuts, grow where they fall, unless\r\ncarried down hill by gravity or by water, or scattered by birds and\r\nsquirrels.\r\n\r\nTrees with winged seeds, however, Fig. 68, as bass, maple and pine,\r\nor with light seeds, as poplar, often have their seeds carried by the\r\nwind to great distances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. Winged Seeds. 1, Basswood; 2, Box-elder; 3,\r\nElm; 4, Fir; 5, 6, 7, 8, Pines. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nAgain some trees, as spruce, are very fertile, while others, like\r\nbeech, have only occasional seed-bearing seasons, once in three or\r\nfour years. Willow seeds lose their power of germination in a few\r\ndays, and hence, unless they soon reach ground where there is plenty\r\nof moisture, they die. This is why they grow mostly along water\r\ncourses. On the other hand, black locust pods and the cones of some\r\npines keep their seeds perfect for many years, often until a\r\nfire bursts them open, and so they live at the expense of their\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\nIt is such facts as these that help to account for some of the acts of\r\nforest composition,--why in one place at one time there is a growth of\r\naspens, at another time pines, at still another oaks; and why beeches\r\nspring up one year and not another. That red cedars grow in avenues\r\nalong fences, is explained by the fact that the seeds are dropped\r\nthere by birds, Fig. 69.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. Red Cedar Avenue. Seeds dropped by birds which\r\nperched on the fences. Indiana. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nThe fact that conifers, as the longleaf pine, Fig. 46, p. 200, and\r\nspruce, Fig. 55, p. 212, are more apt to grow in pure stands than\r\nbroad-leaved trees, is largely accounted for by their winged seeds;\r\nwhereas the broad-leaved trees grow mostly in mixed stands because\r\ntheir heavy seeds are not plentifully and widely scattered. This is\r\na rule not without exceptions, for beech sometimes covers a whole\r\nmountain side, as Slide Mountain in the Catskills, and aspens come in\r\nover a wide area after a fire; but later other trees creep in until at\r\nlength it becomes a mixed forest.\r\n\r\nThe essential facts of the relation of trees to each other in the\r\nforest has been clearly stated by Gifford Pinchot thus:[1]\r\n\r\n    The history of the life of a forest is a story of the help and\r\n    harm which trees receive from one another. On one side every\r\n    tree is engaged in a relentless struggle against its neighbors\r\n    for light, water and food, the three things trees need most.\r\n    On the other side each tree is constantly working with all its\r\n    neighbors, even those which stand at some distance, to bring\r\n    about the best condition of the soil and air for the growth\r\n    and fighting power of every other tree.\r\n\r\nThe trees in a forest help each other by enriching the soil in which\r\nthey stand with their fallen leaves and twigs, which are not quickly\r\nblown or washed away as are those under a tree in the open. This\r\ncollection of \"duff\" or \"the forest floor\" retains the moisture about\r\ntheir roots, and this moist mass tends to keep the temperature of the\r\nforest warmer in winter and cooler in summer. The forest cover, Fig.\r\n55, p. 212, consisting largely of foliage, has the same effect, and in\r\naddition protects the bark, the roots, and the seedlings of the trees\r\nfrom the direct and continuous hot rays of the sun. Without the shade\r\nof the leaves, many trees, as white pine, would quickly die, as\r\nmay readily be seen by transplanting them to the open. The mass of\r\nstanding trees tempers the force of the wind, which might overthrow\r\nsome of them, and hinders the drying up of the duff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. Shallow Roots of Hemlock. Bronx Park, New\r\nYork, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nBut trees hinder as well as help each other. There is a constant\r\nstruggle between them for nourishment and light. To get food and\r\nwater, some trees, as spruces and hemlocks, Fig. 70, spread their\r\nroots out flat; others, as oak and pine, send down a deep tap root.\r\nThose succeed in any environment that find the nourishment they need.\r\nStill more evident is the struggle for light and air. However well a\r\ntree is nourished thru its roots, unless its leaves have an abundance\r\nof light and air it will not thrive and make wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Long-bodied White Oak of the Forest. _U. S.\r\nForest Service._]\r\n\r\nEven the trees most tolerant of shade in youth, like spruce, must have\r\nlight later or perish, and hence in a forest there is the constant\r\nupward reach. This produces the characteristic \"long-bodied\" trunk of\r\nthe forest tree, Fig. 71, in contrast to the \"short-bodied\" tree of\r\nthe open, where the branches reach out in all directions, Fig. 72.\r\nIn this constant struggle for existence is involved the persistent\r\nattempt of scattered seeds to sprout whenever there is an opening. The\r\nresult is that a typical forest is one in which all sizes and ages\r\nof trees grow together. Scattered among these are bushes and scrubby\r\ntrees, called \"forest weeds,\" such as mountain maple and dogwood, Fig.\r\n80, p. 234, which do not produce timber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Short-bodied White Oak of the Open. Fort Lee,\r\nN. J.]\r\n\r\nBy foresters the trees themselves are classified according to their\r\nsize into:\r\n\r\nSeedlings, less than 3' high,\r\nSaplings,\r\n  Small, 3'-10' high.\r\n  Large, 4\" in diameter, at breast height (4' 6\").\r\nPoles,\r\n  Small, 4\"-8\" in diameter, at breast height.\r\n  Large, 8\"-12\" in diameter, at breast height.\r\n  Standards, 1'-2' in diameter, at breast height.\r\n  Veterans, over 2' in diameter, at breast height.\r\n\r\nEvery age has its own dangers. Many seeds never germinate, many\r\nseedlings perish because they do not reach soil, or are killed by\r\ntoo much or too little moisture, or by heat or cold, or shade. At the\r\nsapling age, the side branches begin to interfere with those of other\r\nsaplings. Buds are bruised and lower branches broken by thrashing in\r\nthe wind, and their leaves have less light. Only the upper branches\r\nhave room and light, and they flourish at the expense of lower ones,\r\nwhich gradually die and are thus pruned off. Some trees naturally\r\ngrow faster than others, and they attain additional light and room\r\nto spread laterally, thus overtopping others which are suppressed and\r\nfinally killed, beaten in the race for life.\r\n\r\nIf the growth should remain about even so that the trees grew densely\r\npacked together, the whole group would be likely to be of a poorer\r\nquality, but ordinarily the few outgrow the many and they are called\r\ndominant trees. Even then, they still have to struggle against their\r\nneighbors, and at this, the large sapling stage, many perish, and of\r\nthose that survive there are great differences in size. Trees make\r\ntheir most rapid growth in height, and lay on the widest yearly\r\n\"rings,\" at the large sapling and small pole age, Fig. 114, p. 263. It\r\nis at this stage, too, if the growth is at all dense, that the young\r\ntrees (poles) clean themselves most thoroly of their branches. The\r\ngrowth in diameter continues to the end of the tree's life, long after\r\nthe height growth has ceased.\r\n\r\nWhen trees become \"standards,\" and reach the limit of height growth,\r\nthru their inability to raise water to their tops, their branches\r\nmust perforce grow sidewise, or not at all. The struggle for life thus\r\ntakes a new form.\r\n\r\nHow trees are able to raise water as high as they do is still\r\nunexplained, but we know that the chief reason why some trees grow\r\ntaller than others, is due to their ability to raise water. The most\r\nremarkable in this respect are the California redwoods, the big trees,\r\nand certain eucalypts in Australia. This inability of trees to grow\r\nabove a certain height results in a flattening of the crown, Fig. 73,\r\nand at this stage, the trees struggle against each other by crowding\r\nat the side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Flattened Crown of Red Pine. _U.S. Forest\r\nService._]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as trees grow more sensitive to shade with advancing age, the\r\ntaller trees have the advantage. Each survivor is one of a thousand,\r\nand has outlived the others because it is best fitted for the place.\r\n\r\nThis fact has its effect upon the next generation, because it is these\r\ndominant surviving trees which bear seed most abundantly. After the\r\ntree has finished growing in height and diameter most vigorously--the\r\npole stage--and proved to be fitted for the place, its energy is\r\nlargely spent in raising seed. As this process goes on generation\r\nafter generation, only the best coming to maturity in each, the poorer\r\nsorts are sifted out, and each region and continent has those species\r\nbest fitted to meet the conditions of life there.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why exotics are very likely to be sensitive and\r\nperhaps succumb to influences to which native trees are immune.\r\n\r\nStandards and veterans are the survivors of all the lower stages,\r\neach of which has had its especial dangers. If left alone, the tree\r\ngradually dies and at last falls and decays, adding somewhat to the\r\nfertility of the forest soil. From the point of view of human use, it\r\nwould far better have been cut when ripe and turned into lumber. It\r\nis a mistake to suppose that the natural virgin forest is the best\r\npossible forest, and that it should therefore be left alone. In the\r\nNational Forests the ripe lumber is sold and a considerable revenue\r\nis thus available. But nature's way with the dead tree is to use it\r\nto produce more life. How she does so will be explained in the next\r\nchapter, on the enemies of the forest.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Gifford Pinchot, _Primer of Forestry_, p. 44.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST ORGANISM.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:[A]\r\n\r\nPinchot, _For.

Effect of Wind, July, 1902, Cass County,\r\nMinnesota. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Wind._ \"Windfalls\" are not an uncommon sight in any forest.\r\nFrequently only small areas are blown down, one large tree upsetting a\r\nfew others, or again a vast region is destroyed by great storms, Fig.\r\n74. An area of many square miles in Florida covered with long-leaf\r\npine was thus destroyed several years ago. The \"slash\" thus formed,\r\nwhen well dried, is particularly liable to catch fire and burn\r\nfuriously. Windfalls are especially common among shallow-rooted trees,\r\nas hemlock, basswood and spruce, on sandy soil and on shallow soil\r\nunderlaid with solid stone, especially where open spaces give the wind\r\nfree sweep. It follows that an unbroken forest is a great protection\r\nto itself. The only precautions against wind therefore, that can be\r\ntaken by the forester, are to keep the forest unbroken by selecting\r\nonly the larger trees for felling or to cut down a given tract by\r\nbeginning at the side opposite the direction of prevailing storms and\r\nworking toward them.\r\n\r\nIn sandy regions, the wind does immense harm by blowing the sand to\r\nand fro in constantly shifting dunes, Figs. 75 and 76. These dunes\r\noccupy long stretches of the Atlantic coast and the shore of Lake\r\nMichigan. Such dunes have been estimated to cover 20,000 square miles\r\nof Europe. Along the Bay of Biscay in France, the sand dunes formerly\r\ndrifted in ridges along the shore, damming up the streams and\r\nconverting what was once a forest into a pestilential marsh. This\r\nregion has been reclaimed at great expense by building fences along\r\nthe shore to break the wind and thus keep the moving sand within\r\nlimits. In this way a million acres of productive forest have been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. Sand-dunes, Cape May, New Jersey. _U.S. Forest\r\nService._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. Sand-dune. Oregon. _U.S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand winds are beneficial to the forest in scattering\r\nseeds, weeding out weak trees, and developing strength in tree trunks.\r\n\r\n_Drouth_ both injures the foliage of trees and causes defects in the\r\ngrain of wood, the latter appearing as \"false rings.\" These arise\r\nfrom the effort of the tree to resume growth when the water supply is\r\nrestored. See p. 19.\r\n\r\n_Water._ Certain trees have become accustomed to living in much water,\r\nas cedar and cypress have in swamps, and certain trees have become\r\naccustomed to periodical floods, but other trees are killed by much\r\nwater. So when lumbermen make a pond which overflows forest land, the\r\ntrees soon die, Fig. 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Effect of Flooding. First Connecticut Lake,\r\nNew Hampshire. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Lightning_ frequently blasts single trees, and in dry seasons may set\r\nfire to forests. This is a much more important factor in the west than\r\nin the east,--in the Rockies, for instance, where there are electrical\r\nstorms without rain.\r\n\r\n_Fires_ will be considered later under man's relation to the forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Slim Trees Bent Over by Snow; Stouter Trees\r\nUnharmed. Zurich, Switzerland. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Snow and ice_ often bring serious harm to saplings by permanently\r\nbending them over, Fig. 78, or by breaking off tops and branches.\r\n\r\n_Frost_ kills young plants; and sudden changes in temperature\r\nseriously affect grown timber, producing \"frost checks\" and \"wind\r\nshakes.\" When there is a sudden fall in temperature, the outside\r\nlayers of the tree, which are full of sap, contract more rapidly than\r\nthe inner portions, with the result that the tree splits with a sudden\r\npistol-like report, the check running radially up and down the tree.\r\nThis is called a \"frost check\" or \"star shake,\" Fig. 41._a_, p. 47,\r\nand such wounds rarely heal, Fig. 79.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand when the temperature rapidly rises, the outside\r\nlayers of the tree expand so much more rapidly than the inside, that\r\nthey separate with a dull muffled chug, the check extending in a\r\ncircular direction following the annual rings. Such checks are often\r\ncalled \"wind shakes\" and \"cup shakes,\" Fig. 41._c_, p. 47. These\r\ninjuries are found in regions where sudden changes of temperature\r\noccur, rather than in the tropics or in very cold climates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. Contraction Frost Check. _U. S. Forest\r\nService._]\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE ENEMIES.\r\n\r\nUnder this head may be classed, in addition to fungi, a number of\r\nunrelated plants, including such as: moosewood and dogwood, Fig. 80,\r\nwhich crowd out young trees; vines, like bitter-sweet, which wind\r\nabout trees and often choke them by pressure, cutting thru the bark\r\nand cambium; saprophytes, which smother the foliage of trees, of\r\nwhich Spanish moss, Fig. 47, p. 201, is an example; and finally such\r\nparasites as the mistletoes, which weaken and deform the trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. A \"Forest Weed,\" Flowering Dogwood. North\r\nCarolina. _U.S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nThe most important of the vegetable enemies of trees are fungi. It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that, without the decay produced by\r\nthem, the fallen trees would soon cover the ground, and prevent any\r\nnew growth, thus destroying the natural forest.\r\n\r\nEvery tree, as has been noted (p. 17), is composed of two parts, one\r\npart, including leaves, young branches, roots and sap-wood, living,\r\nand the other part, namely, the heart-wood, practically dead.\r\n\r\nFungi that attack the live parts of a tree are called parasites,\r\nwhile those that live on dead trunks and branches are designated as\r\nsaprophytes. The line, however, between these two classes of fungi is\r\nnot well defined, since some parasites live on both living and dead\r\nwood. The parasites are of first importance, for, since they kill many\r\ntrees, they control to a large extent the supply of living timber.\r\n\r\nNearly all parasitic fungi have two portions, an external fruiting\r\nportion which bears the spores--which correspond to the seeds of\r\nflowering plants--and an internal portion consisting of a tangle of\r\nthreads or filaments, which ramify the tissues of the tree and whose\r\nfunction is to absorb nutriment for the fungus. Fungi are classified\r\nbotanically according to the spore-bearing bodies, their form, color,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe parasitic fungi which are especially destructive to wood are\r\nthose that have naked spores growing on exposed fruiting surfaces (the\r\n_Hymenomycetes_). In toadstools (the _agarics_) these exposed surfaces\r\nare thin, flat plates called gills. In the polypores, which include\r\nthe shelf fungi, the spore surfaces are tubes whose openings\r\nconstitute the pores. In the dry-rot, or tear fungus (_Merulius\r\nlacrymans_), the spore surfaces are shallow cavities.\r\n\r\nSome varieties, called _true_ parasites, develop in uninjured trees,\r\nwhile others, called _wound_ parasites, can penetrate the tissues of\r\ntrees, only where a cut or injury makes a suitable lodgment for the\r\nspores. Some fungi attack only a single species of trees, others whole\r\ngenera; some attack only conifers, others deciduous trees, while a few\r\nattack trees of nearly all kinds alike.\r\n\r\nFungal spores when brought in contact with a wound on a tree or other\r\nsuitable place, and provided with suitable conditions of growth,\r\ngerminate, penetrate the tissues and grow very rapidly. These spores\r\nsend out long threads or filaments which run thru the cells lengthwise\r\nand also pierce them in all directions, soon forming a network in the\r\nwood called the mycelium.\r\n\r\nRotting, in a large number of cases, is due to the ravages of fungi.\r\nThis sometimes shows in the color, as the \"red rot\" of pine or the\r\n\"bluing\" of ash. Sometimes as in \"pecky\" or \"peggy\" cypress, the\r\ndecayed tracts are tubular. More commonly the decayed parts are of\r\nirregular shape.\r\n\r\nThe decay of wood is due to the ravages of low forms of plant life,\r\nboth bacteria and fungi.\r\n\r\nA few of the more destructive forms may be noted.\r\n\r\n    _Trametes pini_ (Brot.) Fr. Foremost among the timber\r\n    destroying fungi is the large brown \"punk\" or \"conch\" found in\r\n    its typical development on the long-leaf and short-leaf pines,\r\n    _Pinus palustris_ and _Pinus echinata_, Fig. 81. The\r\n    fruiting bodies form large masses which grow out from a knot,\r\n    oftentimes as large as a child's head. They are cinnamon brown\r\n    on the lower surface, and much fissured and broken, on the\r\n    black charcoal-like upper surface. This fungus probably causes\r\n    four-fifths of the destruction brought about by the timber\r\n    destroying fungi. It occurs on most of the conifers in the\r\n    United States which have any value as lumber trees, and brings\r\n    about a characteristic white spotting of the wood, Fig. 82,\r\n    which varies with the kind of tree attacked. (Von Schrenk,\r\n    _Agric. Yr. Bk._, 1900, p. 206.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81. A \"Conch,\" the fruiting body of _Trametes\r\npini_, on Sugar Pine. [_Agric. Year Book, 1900_, Pl. XXII, Fig. 2.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Effect of Fungus. (_Trametes pini._) _U. S.\r\nDept. Agric._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83. \"Shelf\" Fungus on Pine. _a._ Sound wood; _b._\r\nResinous \"light\" wood; _c._ Partly decayed wood or punk; _d._ Layer of\r\nliving spore tubes; _e._ Old filled-up spore tubes; _f._ Fluted upper\r\nsurface of the fruiting body of the fungus, which gets its food thru\r\na great number of fine threads (the mycelium), its vegetative tissue\r\npenetrating the wood and causing its decay. [_After Hartig._]]\r\n\r\nOf the shelf fungi, which project like brackets from the stems of\r\ntrees, and have their pores on their under surfaces, one of the\r\ncommonest in many localities is the yellow cheese-like _Polyporus\r\nsulphureus_, Fig. 83. This is found on oak, poplar, willow, larch, and\r\nother standing timber.\r\n\r\n    Its spawnlike threads spread from any exposed portion of\r\n    cambium into the pith-rays and between the annual rings,\r\n    forming thick layers of yellowish-white felt, and penetrating\r\n    the vessels of the wood, which thereupon becomes a deep brown\r\n    color and decays.\r\n\r\nOf the umbrella-shaped gill-bearing fungi, a yellow toadstool, called\r\nthe honey mushroom (_Agaricus melleus_), is a good example, Fig. 84.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Honey Mushroom. _Agaricus melleus._ 1. Cluster\r\nof small sporophores. 2. Larger sporophore with root-like organ of\r\nattachment. _Forestry Bulletin 22._ Plate XII, Figs. 1 and 2.]\r\n\r\n    This fungus, of common occurrence in the United States as well\r\n    as in Europe, is exceedingly destructive to coniferous trees,\r\n    the white pine in particular suffering greatly from its\r\n    attacks. It also fastens upon various deciduous species as a\r\n    parasite, attacking living trees of all ages, but living as\r\n    well upon dead roots and stumps and on wood that has been cut\r\n    and worked up, occurring frequently on bridges, railroad\r\n    ties, and the like, and causing prompt decay wherever it has\r\n    effected an entrance. The most conspicuous part of the fungus\r\n    is found frequently in the summer and fall on the diseased\r\n    parts of the tree or timber infested by it. It is one of the\r\n    common toadstools, this particular species being recognized by\r\n    its yellowish color, gills extending downward upon the stem,\r\n    which is encircled a little lower down by a ring, and by its\r\n    habit of growing in tufts or little clumps of several or many\r\n    individuals together. It is also particularly distinguished by\r\n    the formation of slender, dark-colored strings, consisting of\r\n    compact mycelium, from which the fruiting parts just described\r\n    arise. These hard root-like strings (called rhizomorphs)\r\n    extend along just beneath the surface of the ground, often\r\n    a distance of several feet, and penetrate the roots of sound\r\n    trees. By carefully removing the bark from a root thus invaded\r\n    the fungus is seen in the form of a dense, nearly white,\r\n    mass of mycelium, which, as the parts around decay, gradually\r\n    produces again the rhizomorphs already described. These\r\n    rhizomorphs are a characteristic part of the fungus. Occurring\r\n    both in the decayed wood from which they spread to the\r\n    adjacent parts, and extending in the soil from root to root,\r\n    they constitute a most effective agency in the extension of\r\n    the disease. * * *\r\n\r\n    External symptoms, to be observed especially in young\r\n    specimens recently attacked, consist in a change of the leaves\r\n    to a pale sickly color and often the production of short\r\n    stunted shoots. A still more marked symptom is the formation\r\n    of great quantities of resin, which flow downward thru the\r\n    injured parts and out into the ground. (_Forestry Bulletin_\r\n    No. 22, p. 51.)\r\n\r\nOf the irregular shaped fungi, one of the most destructive is a\r\ntrue parasite, _i.e._, one that finds lodgment without help, called\r\n_Polyporus annosus_ and also _Trametes radiciperda_, Fig. 85. It is\r\npeculiar in developing its fructifications on the exterior of\r\nroots, beneath the soil. Its pores appear on the upper side of the\r\nfructifications. It attacks only conifers.\r\n\r\n    Its spores, which can be readily conveyed in the fur of mice\r\n    or other burrowing animals, germinate in the moisture around\r\n    the roots: the fine threads of \"spawn\" penetrate the cortex,\r\n    and spread thru and destroy the cambium, extending in thin,\r\n    flat, fan-like, white, silky bands, and, here and there,\r\n    bursting thru the cortex in white, oval cushions, on which the\r\n    subterranean fructifications are produced. Each of these is\r\n    a yellowish-white, felt-like mass, with its outer surface\r\n    covered with crowded minute tubes or \"pores\" in which the\r\n    spores are produced. The wood attacked by this fungus first\r\n    becomes rosy or purple, then turns yellowish, and then\r\n    exhibits minute black dots, which surround themselves with\r\n    extending soft white patches. (Boulger, p. 73.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85. 1. Stump of Norway Spruce, with a sporophore\r\nof _polyporus annosus_ several years old; the inner portions of the\r\nstump wholly decayed.\r\n\r\n2. Roots of a diseased spruce tree, with numerous small sporophores\r\nof _polyporus annosus_ attached. _Forestry Bulletin 22_, Plate XIII,\r\nFigs. 1 and 2.]\r\n\r\nOf the fungi which attack converted timber, the most important is \"dry\r\nrot\" or \"tear fungus\" (_Merulius lachrymans_), Fig. 86. It flourishes\r\non damp wood in still air, especially around stables and ill\r\nventilated cellars. It gets its name lachrymans (weeping) from its\r\nhabit of dripping moisture.\r\n\r\n    The fungus destroys the substance of the timber, lessening its\r\n    weight and causing it to warp and crack; until at length it\r\n    crumbles up when dry into a fine brown powder, or, readily\r\n    absorbing any moisture in its neighborhood, becomes a soft,\r\n    cheese-like mass. * * * Imperfectly seasoned timber is most\r\n    susceptible to dry rot: the fungus can be spread either by its\r\n    spawn or by spores, and these latter can be carried even by\r\n    the clothes or saws of workmen, and are, of course, only too\r\n    likely to reach sound wood if diseased timber is left about\r\n    near it; but on the other hand dry timber kept dry is proof\r\n    against dry rot, and exposure to really dry air is fatal to\r\n    the fungus. (Boulger, p. 75.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Portion of the mycelium of dry rot or tear\r\nfungus, _Merulius lachrymans_. This cakelike mass spreads over the\r\nsurface of the timber. In a moist environment pellucid drops or\r\n\"tears\" distil from its lower surface: Hence its name. [Ward:\r\n_Timber_; Fig. 21.]]\r\n\r\nAbout all that can be done to protect the forest against fungi is to\r\nkeep it clean, that is, to clear out fallen timber and slash, and in\r\nsome cases to dig trenches around affected trees to prevent spreading\r\nor to cut them out and destroy them. Such methods have heretofore been\r\ntoo expensive to employ in any ordinary American forest, but the time\r\nis at hand when such action will prove profitable in many localities.\r\n\r\nFor the preservation of cut timber from decay, several methods are\r\nused. Fungi need heat, air, moisture and food. If any one of these is\r\nlacking the fungus cannot grow. Air and heat are hard to exclude from\r\nwood, but moisture and food can be kept from fungi. The removal of\r\nmoisture is called seasoning, and the poisoning of the food of fungi\r\nis a process of impregnating wood with certain chemicals. Both these\r\nprocesses are described in _Handwork in Wood_, Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL ENEMIES.\r\n\r\nThe larger animals working damage to our forests are chiefly rodents\r\nand grazing animals. Beavers gnaw the bark, while mice and squirrels\r\nrob the forest of seed and consequently of new trees. The acorns of\r\nwhite oak are particularly liable to be devoured because of their\r\nsweetness, while those of red and black oak, which afford timber of\r\ncomparatively little value, are allowed to sprout, and thus come to\r\npossess the land. Hogs annually consume enormous quantities of \"mast,\"\r\n_i.e._, acorns or other nuts, by pasturing in oak and other forests.\r\nThey, together with goats and sheep, Figs. 87 and 88, deer and cattle,\r\nwork harm by trampling and browsing. Browsing destroys the tender\r\nshoots, especially of deciduous trees, but trampling entirely kills\r\nout the seedlings. The cutting up of the soil by the sharp cleft hoofs\r\ninjures the forest floor, by pulverizing it and allowing it to be\r\nreadily washed away by storms until deforestation may result, as was\r\nthe case in France after the Revolution. It has cost the French people\r\nfrom thirty to forty million dollars to repair the damage begun by the\r\nsheep. In this country, this matter has become a very serious one\r\non the Pacific Coast, where there are enormous flocks of sheep, and\r\ntherefore the government is trying to regulate the grazing on public\r\nlands there, especially on steep slopes, where erosion takes place\r\nrapidly.[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The evils of grazing are increased by the fact\r\n    that fires are sometimes started intentionally in order to\r\n    increase the area of grazing land.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. Goats Eating Foliage, New Mexico. _U.S. Forest\r\nService._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. Sheep Grazing in Forest, Idaho. _U.S. Forest\r\nService._]\r\n\r\nThe most destructive animal enemies of the forest are the insects.\r\nThe average annual loss of trees in the United States from this cause\r\nalone has been estimated to be one hundred million dollars.\r\n\r\nInsects have two objects in their attack on trees, one is to obtain\r\nfood, as when they are in the larval stage, and the other is to\r\nprovide for offspring, as do certain beetles.\r\n\r\nThe number of insect enemies of the forest is enormous. At the St.\r\nLouis Exposition, there were on exhibit nearly three hundred such\r\ninsects. These belong to some twenty orders, of which the beetles\r\n(_Coleoptera_), which have horny wings and biting mouth parts, and\r\nthe moths and butterflies (_Lepidoptera_), with membraneous wings and\r\nsucking mouth parts, are the most destructive. Insects attack every\r\npart of the tree, the seed, the shoot, the flower, the root, the leaf,\r\nthe bark and the wood, both standing and cut.\r\n\r\nOf the fruit and seed pests, the most destructive are weevils, worms\r\nand gall insects.\r\n\r\nOf the twig and shoot pests, beetles, weevils and caterpillars are the\r\nworst.\r\n\r\nAmong insects that attack roots, the periodical cicada (17 year old\r\nlocust) may be noted.\r\n\r\nThe leaf pests are far more serious. They include the true and false\r\ncaterpillars, moths, gall insects and plant lice.\r\n\r\nOf the bark pests, the bark beetles are the most destructive. These\r\nare also called Engraver Beetles from the smoothly cut figures which\r\nare their burrows under the bark, Figs. 89, 90, 91.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Work of the Spruce Destroying Beetle: _a._\r\nPrimary gallery; _b._ Borings packed in side; _c._ Entrance and\r\ncentral burrow thru the packed borings; _d._ Larval mines.

Brood Galleries of the Oak Bark Beetle,\r\nshowing Character of Primary Gallery at _b_; Larval or Brood Mines at\r\n_a._ [_Agric. Year Book_, 1903, Fig. 30, page 318.]]\r\n\r\n    Many pairs of beetles make a simultaneous attack on the lower\r\n    half of the main trunk of medium-sized to large trees. They\r\n    bore thru the outer bark to the inner living portion, and thru\r\n    the inner layers of the latter; they excavate long, irregular,\r\n    longitudinal galleries, and along the sides of these at\r\n    irregular intervals, numerous eggs are closely placed. The\r\n    eggs soon hatch and the larvae at once commence to feed on the\r\n    inner bark, and as they increase in size, extend and enlarge\r\n    their food burrows in a general transverse but irregular\r\n    course, away from the mother galleries (see illustration).\r\n    When these young and larval forms are full grown, each\r\n    excavates a cavity or cell at the end of its burrow and next\r\n    to the outer corky bark. (Hopkins, _Agric. Yr. Bk._, 1902.)\r\n\r\nSome of the species attack living trees, causing their rapid death,\r\nand are among the most destructive enemies of American forests.\r\n\r\nAll of the above indirectly affect both the quantity and quality\r\nof the wood supply. They can be studied more in detail in the\r\npublications of the U.S. Bureau of Entomology.\r\n\r\nOf the insects directly attacking wood, the most important are the\r\nambrosia or timber beetles, the borers, the ants, and the carpenter\r\nbees. The most remarkable feature of the beetle is the manner of its\r\nboring into the harder parts of the wood. Its jaws are particularly\r\nconstructed for this work, being heavy and strong. The boring is\r\ndone something after the manner of countersinking, and the jaws are\r\nbelieved to be self-sharpening, by reason of the peculiar right to\r\nleft and left to right motion.\r\n\r\n    _Ambrosia_ or _timber beetles_, Fig. 92. This class of insects\r\n    attacks living, dead, and felled trees, sawlogs, green lumber,\r\n    and stave-bolts, often causing serious injury and loss from\r\n    the pin-hole and stained-wood defects caused by their brood\r\n    galleries. The galleries are excavated by the parent beetles\r\n    in the sound sap-wood sometimes extending into the heart-wood,\r\n    and the young stages feed on a fungus growth which grows on\r\n    the walls of galleries. (Hopkins, Entom. Bulletin No. 48, p.\r\n    10.) The growth of this ambrosia-like fungus is induced or\r\n    controlled by the parent beetles and the young are dependent\r\n    on it for food. (Hopkins, _Agric. Yr. Bk._, 1904.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.

[_Agric. Year Book_, 1904, Fig. 45, p. 384.]]\r\n\r\n    There are two general types or classes of these galleries, one\r\n    in which the broods develop together in the main burrows, the\r\n    other, in which the individuals develop in short separate side\r\n    chambers extending at right angles from the primary gallery,\r\n    Fig. 93. The galleries of the latter type are usually\r\n    accompanied by a distinct staining of the wood, while those of\r\n    the former are not. (Hopkins, _Agric. Yr. Bk._, 1904, p. 383.)\r\n\r\n    _Bark_ and _wood borers_, Fig. 94. This class of enemies\r\n    differs from the preceding in the fact that the parent beetles\r\n    do not burrow into the wood or bark, but deposit their eggs\r\n    on the surface. The elongate, whitish, round-headed\r\n    (_Cerambycid_), flat-headed (_Buprestid_), or short, stout\r\n    (_Curculionid_) grubs hatching from these eggs cause injury\r\n    by burrowing beneath the bark, or deep into the sap-wood and\r\n    heart-wood of living, injured and dead trees, sawlogs, etc.\r\n    Some of the species infest living trees, Fig. 95, causing\r\n    serious injury or death. Others attack only dead or dying bark\r\n    and wood, but this injury often results in great loss from the\r\n    so-called wormhole defects. (A. D. Hopkins, _Entom. Bull._, No.\r\n    48, p. 10.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.

Hoquiam,\r\nWashington. _U.S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n    The pine sawyers are among the most troublesome pests in the\r\n    mill yard, and their large, white larvae often do much damage\r\n    to logs by eating great holes thru their solid interior. While\r\n    burrowing in the wood the larvae make a peculiar grating sound\r\n    that may be heard on quiet nights at a considerable distance.\r\n    This is a familiar sound in the lumber camps of the North,\r\n    and has probably given rise to the name of the pine sawyers by\r\n    which these insects are known. (_Forestry Bulletin_, No. 22,\r\n    p. 58.)\r\n\r\n    _Powder-post beetles_, Fig. 96. This is a class of insects\r\n    representing two or three families of beetles, the larvae of\r\n    which infest and convert into fine powder many different kinds\r\n    of dry and seasoned wood products, such as hickory and ash\r\n    handles, wagon spokes, lumber, etc., when wholly or in part\r\n    from the sap-wood of trees. Oak and hemlock tan-bark is\r\n    sometimes injured to a great extent, and the structural\r\n    timbers of old houses, barns, etc., are often seriously\r\n    injured, while hop poles and like products are attacked by one\r\n    set of these insects, the adults of which burrow into the wood\r\n    for the purpose of depositing their eggs. (Hopkins, _Forestry\r\n    Bulletin_ No. 48, p. 11.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.

They enter the\r\n    wood from eggs deposited in wounds in living trees, from\r\n    which they burrow deep into the heart-wood. Generation after\r\n    generation may develop in the wood of a tree without affecting\r\n    its life but the wood is rendered worthless for most purposes\r\n    by the so-called wormhole and pinhole defects resulting from\r\n    their burrows. The same species also breed in the wood of\r\n    dying and dead standing trees, and in the stumps and logs of\r\n    felled ones, often for many years after the trees are felled.\r\n    One species sometimes attacks freshly sawed oak lumber, new\r\n    stave bolts, etc. They are among the most destructive enemies\r\n    of hardwood forest trees, especially in reducing the value of\r\n    the wood of the best part of the trunks. (Hopkins, _Forestry\r\n    Bulletin_ No. 48, p. 10.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.

[_Agric. Year Book_, 1904, Fig. 47, p. 386.]]\r\n\r\n    The _carpenter worms_, Fig. 98. These are large pinkish\r\n    caterpillars which are the larvae of stout-bodied moths. They\r\n    enter the bark and wood of living oak, locust, poplar and\r\n    other trees, from eggs deposited by the moths in the crevices\r\n    of uninjured bark, or in the edges of wounds. They burrow deep\r\n    into the solid wood, where they live for two or three years\r\n    before transforming to the adult. The wood is seriously\r\n    injured by the very large wormhole defects, and while the\r\n    life of the tree is but slightly, if at all, affected by the\r\n    earlier attacks, the continued operations of this class of\r\n    borers year after year, finally results in the decay of\r\n    the heart-wood, or a hollow trunk and a dead top. (Hopkins,\r\n    _Forestry Bulletin_, No. 48, p. 11.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. Worm Holes in Red Oak, Work of the Oak\r\nCarpenter Worm. [_Agric. Year Book_, 1903, Fig. 37, p. 324.]]\r\n\r\n    _Columbian Timber-beetle_ One of the commonest wormhole defects\r\n    in white oak, rock oak, beech, and tulip (\"whitewood\" or\r\n    \"yellow poplar\") is one known to the lumber trade as grease\r\n    spots, patch-worm, or black holes, Fig. 99, steam boats, Fig.\r\n    100, etc., caused by the Columbian timber beetle (_Corthylus\r\n    columbianus Hopk_.) The characteristic feature of this\r\n    wormhole defect, which will enable it to be readily recognized\r\n    in oak and beech, is transverse series of two or more black\r\n    holes about the size of the lead in an ordinary lead pencil,\r\n    with a streak of stained wood extending with the grain two\r\n    or three or more inches each side, as in Fig. 99. In\r\n    quarter-sawed oak or split or sawed staves, a short\r\n    longitudinal section of one of these black holes is seen\r\n    attended by the stained streak on one side of a thick or curly\r\n    growth or grain, Fig. 100. It is this form which is called\r\n    \"steamboats.\" In whitewood (yellow poplar) the black holes\r\n    are attended by very long black, greenish, or bluish streaks,\r\n    sometimes five or six feet long. When this is common in the\r\n    lumber it is called \"calico poplar.\" Fig. 101 represents the\r\n    characteristic appearance of this defect greatly reduced.\r\n    (Hopkins, _Agric. Yr. Bk._, 1903, p. 327.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99. Work of the Columbian Timber Beetle: Black\r\nholes and \"grease spots\" in white oak. [_Agric. Year Book_, 1903, Fig.\r\n38, p. 325.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100. Work of the Columbian Timber Beetle:\r\n\"Steamboats\" in quartered or Split white oak. [_Agric.

Year Book_ 1903, Fig. 40, p. 326.]]\r\n\r\n    _Carpenter bees._ The work of this class of woodboring bees\r\n    is shown in Fig. 102. The injury consists of large augerlike\r\n    tunnels in exposed, solid dry wood of buildings and other\r\n    structures. It is most common in soft woods, such as pine,\r\n    poplar, redwood and the like. (Hopkins, _Agric. Yr. Bk._,\r\n    1904, p. 390.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.

Year Book_, 1904, Fig. 53, p.\r\n390.]]\r\n\r\n    _Horn tails._ This is a class of borers which are the larvae\r\n    of the so-called wood wasps. They may enter the exposed dead\r\n    wood of wounds of living trees, but more commonly attack the\r\n    wood of dead standing conifers and hard woods, in the sap-wood\r\n    of which they excavate irregular burrows, which are packed\r\n    with their borings. When the adults emerge they leave the\r\n    surface perforated with numerous round holes. Water and fungi\r\n    entering these holes cause a very rapid decay of the wood.\r\n    (Hopkins, _Entom. Bull._ No. 48, p. 11.)\r\n\r\nThe tunnels of these various wood pests are most frequently to be seen\r\nin chestnut, ash, hickory, oak, tulip, and cypress.\r\n\r\nOne would think that with such an array of enemies, the forest would\r\nhardly survive, but on the other hand there are many enemies of these\r\npests. The most destructive are the predaceous and parasitic insects.\r\nMany insects are simply predaceous, pouncing upon and destroying such\r\nother insects as they can overcome. Still others are parasites, some\r\nexternal, but most of them living within the bodies of their victims\r\nwhere they pass their entire larval life. The eggs are laid on or\r\nin the body of the victim, so that as soon as one hatches, it has\r\nsuitable food. The ichneumon fly, Fig. 103, is such a parasite;\r\nit destroys millions of insect pests. It has a long and peculiar\r\novipositor with which it drills a hole into the tree and deposits the\r\negg in a burrow of the Pigeon Horntail, a wood wasp that burrows into\r\ndeciduous trees. The larva soon finds its victim, the grub of the\r\nPigeon Horntail, and lives on it to its destruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103. Ichneumon Fly whose Larva Feeds on the Larva\r\nof the Pigeon Horn-tail.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that it is a hopeless task to control the insect enemies\r\nof forest trees and forest products or to prevent losses from their\r\nravages, but the writer is informed by Dr. A. D. Hopkins, the expert\r\nin the Bureau of Entomology in charge of forest insect investigations,\r\nthat the results of their investigations show conclusively that there\r\nare many practical and inexpensive methods of control now available\r\nthru the suggestions and recommendations in recent Department\r\npublications on forest insects, as well as thru direct correspondence\r\nwith the Department. These methods are based on the principle of\r\nprevention and not on that of extermination. It has been shown that\r\nthru proper adjustment of the details in management of forests and of\r\nthe business of manufacturing, storing, transporting, and utilizing\r\nthe products a large percentage of the losses can be prevented at\r\nsmall additional expense, and that even when considerable cost is\r\ninvolved the amount saved will often represent a handsome profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE FOREST.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:[A]\r\n\r\n(1) Meterological.\r\n\r\n      Pinchot, _Primer_ I, pp. 75-76.\r\n      Roth, _First Book_, _pp._ 198-202.\r\n      Bruncken, pp. 27-29.\r\n\r\n    Water.\r\n      Roth, _First Book_, p. 27.\r\n\r\n    Snow, ice and frost.\r\n      Pinchot, _Primer_, I, p. 76.\r\n      Bruce, _For. and Irr._, 8: 159, Ap.

When cruisers first began to locate claims in\r\nthis country, practically no regions had been devastated by fire. Now\r\nsuch regions are to be seen everywhere. Altho lightning occasionally\r\nsets fire to forests, especially in the Rocky Mountains, the losses\r\nfrom this cause are trifling compared with the total loss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104. Slash, Left in the Woods, and Ready to Catch\r\nFire. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Opportunities for fire._ There are a number of facts that make the\r\nforest peculiarly liable to fire. Especially in the fall there are\r\ngreat quantities of inflammable material, such as dry leaves, twigs,\r\nand duff lying loose ready for ignition. The bark of some trees,\r\nas \"paper birch,\" and the leaves of others, as conifers, are very\r\ninflammable. It follows that fires are more common in coniferous than\r\nin deciduous forests. After lumbering or windfalls, the accumulated\r\n\"slash\" burns easily and furiously, Fig. 104. Moreover a region once\r\nburned over, is particularly liable to burn again, on account of the\r\naccumulation of dry trunks and branches. See Fig. 107.\r\n\r\nLong dry seasons and high wind furnish particularly favorable\r\nconditions for fire. On the other hand, the wind by changing in\r\ndirection may extinguish the fire by turning it back upon its track.\r\nIndeed the destructive power of fires depends largely upon the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105. Forest Fire. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Causes of fire._ Forest fires are due to all sorts of causes,\r\naccidental and intentional. Dropped matches, smouldering tobacco,\r\nneglected camp fires and brush fires, locomotive sparks, may all be\r\naccidental causes that under favorable conditions entail tremendous\r\nloss. There is good reason to believe that many forest fires are set\r\nintentionally. The fact that grass and berry bushes will soon spring\r\nup after a fire, leads sheep men, cattle and pig owners, and berry\r\npickers to set fires. Vast areas are annually burned over in the\r\nUnited States for these reasons. Most fires run only along the surface\r\nof the ground, doing little harm to the big timber, and if left alone\r\nwill even go out of themselves; but if the duff is dry, the fire may\r\nsmoulder in it a long time, ready to break out into flame when it\r\nreaches good fuel or when it is fanned by the wind, Fig. 105. Even\r\nthese ground fires do incalculable damage to seeds and seedlings, and\r\nthe safest plan is to put out every fire no matter how small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Burned Forest of Engelmann Spruce.\r\nForeground, Lodgepole Pine Coming in. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nAltho it is true that the loss of a forest is not irremediable because\r\nvegetation usually begins again at once, Fig. 106, yet the actual\r\ndamage is almost incalculable. The tract may lie year after year,\r\ncovered with only worthless weeds and bushes, and if hilly, the region\r\nat once begins to be eroded by the rains.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire, may come high winds that blow down the trunks of the\r\ntrees, preparing material for another fire, Fig. 107.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. Effect of Fire and Wind. Colorado. _U. S.\r\nForest Service._]\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the actual annual money loss of the timber burned\r\nin the United States are not gathered. In 1880 Professor Sargent\r\ncollected much information, and in the census of that year (10th\r\nCensus, Vol. IX) reported 10,000,000 acres burned that year at a value\r\nof $25,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, the Division of Forestry collected authentic records of\r\n12,000,000 acres burned over in a single year, at an estimated value\r\nof $50,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn the Adironacks in the spring of 1903, an unprecedentedly dry\r\nseason, fire after fire caused a direct loss of about $3,500,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, a fire on the dividing line between Washington and Oregon\r\ndestroyed property amounting to $12,000,000. Within comparatively\r\nrecent years, the Pacific Coast states have lost over $100,000,000\r\nworth of timber by fire alone.\r\n\r\nDuring September, 1908, forest fires raged in Minnesota, Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Maine, New York and Pennsylvania. The estimates of loss\r\nfor northern Michigan alone amounted to $40,000,000. For two weeks\r\nthe loss was set at $1,000,000 a day. The two towns of Hibbing and\r\nChisholm were practically wiped out of existence, and 296 lives were\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nCertain forest fires have been so gigantic and terrible as to become\r\nhistoric.\r\n\r\n    One of these is the Miramichi fire of 1825. It began its\r\n    greatest destruction about one o'clock in the afternoon of\r\n    October 7th of that year, at a place about sixty miles\r\n    above the town of Newcastle, on the Miramichi River, in New\r\n    Brunswick. Before ten o'clock at night it was twenty miles\r\n    below New Castle. In nine hours it had destroyed a belt of\r\n    forest eighty miles long and twenty-five miles wide. Over more\r\n    than two and a half million acres almost every living thing\r\n    was killed. Even the fish were afterwards found dead in heaps\r\n    on the river banks. Many buildings and towns were destroyed,\r\n    one hundred and sixty persons perished, and nearly a thousand\r\n    head of stock. The loss from the Miramichi fire is estimated\r\n    at $300,000, not including the value of the timber. (Pinchot,\r\n    Part 1. p. 79-80.)\r\n\r\n    Of such calamities, one of the worst that is on record is that\r\n    known as the Peshtigo fire, which, in 1871, during the same\r\n    month, October, when Chicago was laid in ashes, devastated the\r\n    country about the shores of Green Bay in Wisconsin. More than\r\n    $3,000,000 worth of property was burnt, at least two thousand\r\n    families of settlers were made homeless, villages were\r\n    destroyed and over a thousand lives lost. (Bruncken, p. 110.)\r\n\r\n    The most destructive fire of more recent years was that which\r\n    started near Hinckley, Minn., September 1, 1894. While the\r\n    area burned over was less than in some other great fires, the\r\n    loss of life and property was very heavy. Hinckley and six\r\n    other towns were destroyed, about 500 lives were lost, more\r\n    than 2,000 persons were left destitute, and the estimated loss\r\n    in property of various kinds was $25,000,000. Except for the\r\n    heroic conduct of locomotive engineers and other railroad men,\r\n    the loss of life would have been far greater.\r\n\r\n    This fire was all the more deplorable, because it was wholly\r\n    unnecessary. For many days before the high wind came and drove\r\n    it into uncontrollable fury, it was burning slowly close to\r\n    the town of Hinckley and could have been put out. (Pinchot,\r\n    Part I, 82-83.)\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable features of these \"crown fires,\" is the\r\nrapidity with which they travel. The Miramichi fire traveled nine\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nTo get an idea of the fury of a forest fire, read this description\r\nfrom Bruncken. After describing the steady, slow progress of a duff\r\nfire, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n    But there comes an evening when nobody thinks of going to bed.\r\n    All day the smoke has become denser and denser, until it is no\r\n    longer a haze, but a thick yellowish mass of vapor, carrying\r\n    large particles of sooty cinders, filling one's eyes and\r\n    nostrils with biting dust, making breathing oppressive. There\r\n    is no escape from it. Closing windows and doors does not bar\r\n    it out of the houses; it seems as if it could penetrate solid\r\n    walls. Everything it touches feels rough, as if covered with\r\n    fine ashes. The heat is horrible altho no ray of sunshine\r\n    penetrates the heavy pall of smoke.\r\n\r\n    In the distance a rumbling, rushing sound is heard. It is the\r\n    fire roaring in the tree tops on the hill sides, several miles\r\n    from town. This is no longer a number of small fires, slowly\r\n    smouldering away to eat up a fallen log; nor little dancing\r\n    flames running along the dry litter on the ground, trying to\r\n    creep up the bark of a tree, where the lichens are thick and\r\n    dry, but presently falling back exhausted. The wind has risen,\r\n    fanning the flames on all sides, till they leap higher and\r\n    higher, reaching the lower branches of the standing timber,\r\n    enveloping the mighty boles of cork pine in a sheet of flame,\r\n    seizing the tall poles of young trees and converting them\r\n    into blazing beacons that herald the approach of destruction.\r\n    Fiercer and fiercer blows the wind, generated by the fire\r\n    itself as it sends currents of heated air rushing upward into\r\n    infinity. Louder and louder the cracking of the branches as\r\n    the flames seize one after the other, leaping from crown to\r\n    crown, rising high above the tree tops in whirling wreaths\r\n    of fire, and belching forth clouds of smoke hundreds of feet\r\n    still higher. As the heated air rises more and more, rushing\r\n    along with a sound like that of a thousand foaming mountain\r\n    torrents, burning brands are carried along, whirling on across\r\n    the firmament like evil spirits of destruction, bearing the\r\n    fire miles away from its origin, then falling among the dry\r\n    brush heaps of windfall or slashing, and starting another fire\r\n    to burn as fiercely as the first. * * *\r\n\r\n    There is something horrible in the slow, steady approach of\r\n    a top fire. It comes on with the pitiless determination of\r\n    unavoidable destiny, not faster than a man can walk. But there\r\n    is no stopping it. You cannot fight a fire that seizes tree\r\n    top after tree top, far above your reach, and showers down\r\n    upon the pigmy mortals that attempt to oppose it an avalanch\r\n    of burning branches, driving them away to escape the torture\r\n    and death that threatens them. (Bruncken, _American Forests\r\n    and Forestry_, 106-109.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108. Fighting Forest Fire. _U. S. Forest\r\nService._]\r\n\r\nReal forest fires are not usually put out; men only try to limit them.\r\nA common method of limitation is to cut trenches thru the duff so that\r\nthe fire cannot pass across, Fig. 108. In serious cases back fires are\r\nbuilt on the side of the paths or roads or trenches toward the fire,\r\nin the expectation that the two fires will meet. In such cases great\r\ncare has to be taken that the back fire itself does not escape. Small\r\nfires, however, can sometimes be beaten out or smothered with dirt and\r\nsand, since water is usually unavailable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. Fire Lane. Worcester Co., Mass. _U. S. Forest\r\nService._]\r\n\r\nBut \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" One of the best\r\nof these preventions is a system of fire lanes. Even narrow paths of\r\ndirt will stop an ordinary fire. Roads, of course, are still better.\r\nSystems of fire lanes, Fig. 109, are made great use of in Europe\r\nand British India. Belts of hardwood trees are also cultivated along\r\nrailways, and to break up large bodies of conifers.\r\n\r\nIf in lumbering, the slash were destroyed or even cut up so as to lie\r\nnear the ground and rot quickly, many fires would be prevented.\r\n\r\nSome states, as New York, have a fairly well organized system of fire\r\nwardens, who have the authority to draft as much male help as\r\nthey need at $2.00 a day to fight forest fires. Unfortunately\r\n\"ne'er-do-wells\" sometimes set fire to the woods, in order to \"make\r\nwork\" for themselves. Much preventive work is also done by educating\r\nthe public in schools and by the posting of the fire notices,[1] Fig.\r\n110.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Look out for Fire. Rules and Laws.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTIVE LUMBERING.\r\n\r\nHow the reckless and destructive methods of lumbering common in\r\nAmerica came into vogue, is worth noting.[2]\r\n\r\nThe great historical fact of the first half century of our country\r\nwas the conquest of the wilderness. That wilderness was largely an\r\nunbroken forest. To the early settler, this forest was the greatest\r\nof barriers to agriculture. The crash of a felled tree was to him a\r\nsymbol of advancing civilization. The woods were something to be got\r\nrid of to make room for farms, Fig. 111. In Virginia, for example,\r\nwhere the soil was soon exhausted by tobacco culture and modern\r\nfertilizers were unknown, there was a continual advance into the woods\r\nto plant on new and richer land. The forest was also full of enemies\r\nto the settler, both animals and Indians, and was a dreaded field for\r\nfire. So there grew up a feeling of hate and fear for the forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111. Forest Giving Place to Farm Land. North\r\nCarolina. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nMore than that the forest seemed exhaustless. The clearings were at\r\nfirst only specks in the woods, and even when they were pushed farther\r\nand farther back from the seacoast, there was plenty of timber beyond.\r\n\r\n    The idea that the area of this forest could ever be diminished\r\n    by human hands to any appreciable extent so that people would\r\n    become afraid of not having woodland enough to supply them\r\n    with the needed lumber, would have seemed an utter absurdity\r\n    to the backwoodsman. * * * Thus the legend arose of the\r\n    inexhaustible supply of lumber in American forests, a legend\r\n    which only within the last twenty years has given place to\r\n    juster notions. (Bruncken, p. 57.)\r\n\r\nThis tradition of abundant supply and the feeling of hostility to the\r\nforest lasted long after the reasons for them had disappeared. When\r\nwe remember that every farm in the eastern United States, is made from\r\nreclaimed forest land and that for decades lumber was always within\r\nreach up the rivers, down which it was floated, it is not strange that\r\nreckless and extravagant methods of cutting and using it prevailed.\r\n\r\nFollowing the settler came the lumberman, who continued the same\r\nmethod of laying waste the forest land. The lumber market grew slowly\r\nat first, but later developed by leaps and bounds, until now the\r\noutput is enormous.\r\n\r\nLumbering in America has come to be synonymous with the clearing off\r\nof all the marketable timber, regardless of the future. It treats the\r\nforest as tho it were a mine, not a crop, Fig. 112. Since 1880 the\r\ntotal cut has been over 700,000,000 feet, enough to make a one inch\r\nfloor over Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and\r\nDelaware, or one-half of the State of New York, an area of 25,000\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. Redwood Forest Turned Into Pasture.\r\nCalifornia. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nOther countries, too, have devastated their forests. Portugal has\r\na forest area of only 5 per cent. of the total land area, Spain and\r\nGreece, each 13 per cent., Italy 14 per cent. and Turkey 20 per cent.\r\nWhether the destruction of the American forests shall go as far\r\nas this is now a live question which has only just begun to be\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the reckless American attitude toward the forest is\r\nthe frequency and severity of forest fires. This has led to the fear\r\non the part of lumbermen of losing what stumpage they had, and so they\r\nhave cleared their holdings quickly and sold the timber. Their motto\r\nwas \"cut or lose.\"\r\n\r\nA third incentive to devastative methods was the levy of what were\r\nconsidered unjust taxes.\r\n\r\n    Hundreds of thousands of acres in the white pine region,\r\n    notably in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, have been cut\r\n    over, abandoned, sold for taxes, and finally reduced by fire\r\n    to a useless wilderness because of the shortsighted policy of\r\n    heavy taxation. To lay heavy taxes on timber land is to set\r\n    a premium on forest destruction, a premium that is doing\r\n    more than any other single factor to hinder the spread of\r\n    conservative lumbering among the owners of large bodies\r\n    of timber land. * * * Heavy taxes are responsible for the\r\n    barrenness of thousands of square miles which should never\r\n    have ceased to be productive, and which must now lie fallow\r\n    for many decades before they can be counted again among the\r\n    wealth-making assets of the nation. (Pinchot, _Agric. Yr.\r\n    Bk._, 1898, pp. 184-185.)\r\n\r\n    On the treatment of the questions of fire and taxes depends\r\n    the future of American forest industries. (Bruncken, p. 226.)\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly much waste has been caused by sheer ignorance of forest\r\nconditions and methods, which, if followed, would secure successive\r\ncrops instead of one, but it is safe to say that the desire for\r\nimmediate profits has been the dominant cause of reckless lumbering.\r\nSo short-sighted has the policy of private owners proved itself, that\r\nit is a question whether any large extent of forest land can safely\r\nbe left in private hands. No individual lives long enough to reap more\r\nthan one forest crop. Only corporations and States can be expected\r\nto have an interest long enough continued to justify the methods of\r\nconservative lumbering.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, nearly one-half of the privately owned timber\r\nof the United States is held by 195 great holders, the principal ones\r\nbeing the Southern Pacific Company, the Weyerhauser Timber Company,\r\nand the Northern Pacific Railway Company, which together own nearly 11\r\nper cent. of the privately owned forests of the country. These large\r\nholders are cutting little of their timber, their object, however,\r\nbeing not so much to conserve the forests as to reserve to themselves\r\nthe incalculable private profits which are expected to come with the\r\nfuture enormous increase in the value of timber.\r\n\r\nOver against this policy, stands that of the United States Forest\r\nService of increasing the area of the National Forests in order to\r\nconserve them for the public welfare. The pity is that the government\r\never let the forests pass out of its hands. Only forty years ago\r\nseventy-five per cent. of the timber now standing was publicly owned.\r\nNow about eighty per cent. of it is privately owned. In the meanwhile\r\nits value has increased anywhere from ten to fifty fold, according to\r\nlocality.[3] Some large corporations, however, like the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, the Kirby Lumber Company, of Texas, and the International\r\nPaper Company, have entered upon a policy of conservative lumbering.\r\n\r\nOf the actual practices which distinguish destructive lumbering, a few\r\nmay be cited. Stumps are cut too high and tops too low. Good lumber is\r\nwasted on lumber roads and bridges, Fig. 113. Saplings are torn down\r\nin dragging out logs. Slash is left in condition to foster fires and\r\nleft with no shade protection. Seedlings are smothered with slash.\r\nSeed trees are all cut out leaving no chance for reproduction. Only\r\npoorer sorts of trees are left standing, thus insuring deterioration.\r\nPaper pulp cutting goes even farther than lumbering, and ordinarily\r\nleaves nothing behind but a howling wilderness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113. Red Spruce Used in Building Skidway, and Left\r\nin the Woods. Hamilton Co., New York.]\r\n\r\nThe production of turpentine from the long-leaf pine, Fig. 114, at\r\nthe annual rate of 40,000 barrels has meant the devastation of 70,000\r\nacres of virgin forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114. Turpentine Boxing, Cup System. Georgia. _U.\r\nS. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\nIn view of this wholesale destruction it becomes of interest to know\r\nhow much still remains of the timber supply of the United States.\r\nThe latest and most authoritative estimate of standing timber\r\nin continental United States, excluding Alaska, gives a total of\r\n2,800,000,000 M feet B.M.,[4] of which 2,200,000,000 M feet are\r\nprivately owned, about 539,000,000 M feet are in the National Forests\r\n(Fig. 119, p. 271,) and 90,000,000 M feet are on the unreserved public\r\nlands, National parks, State lands and Indian reservations.\r\n\r\nEarlier estimates were hardly more than guesses. For example the\r\ncensus of 1880 estimated the stumpage of the U. S. at 856,290,100 M\r\nfeet, while the census of 1900 gives a total of 1,390,000,000 M feet.\r\nThe discrepancy appears still greater when it is remembered that in\r\nthe meantime 700,000,000 M feet were cut. Of this amount 500,000,000 M\r\nfeet were of conifers or 80,000,000 M feet more than were included in\r\nthe estimate of 1880. The simple fact is of course that the earlier\r\nestimates were gross underestimates, due to the fact that they were\r\nbased on entirely inadequate data, and therefore can not be used to\r\nobscure the now unquestionable fact that the timber supply of this\r\ncountry is surely and rapidly melting away.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Service estimates that the present annual cut of saw timber\r\nis about 50,000,000 M feet. At this rate the present stand would last\r\nabout 55 years and the privately owned timber only 44 years. This\r\nestimate does not allow for growth and decay.\r\n\r\nWhile the population of the United States increased 52 per cent. from\r\n1880 to 1900, during the same period the lumber-cut increased 94 per\r\ncent. In other words the yearly increase in use is 20 to 25 per\r\ncent. per capita, that is, fast as the population grows, the lumber\r\nconsumption increases nearly twice as fast. This increase in the\r\nlumber-cut far overbalances the growth of trees.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be remembered that this increase in the use of lumber is\r\nin spite of the enormous increase of substitutes for lumber, such as\r\nbrick, cement and steel for building, and steel for bridges, vehicles,\r\nfences, machinery, tools, and implements of all kinds.\r\n\r\nHow lavishly we use lumber may further be appreciated from the fact\r\nthat we consume 260 cubic feet[5] per capita, while the average for\r\n13 European countries is but 49 cubic feet per capita. In other words\r\nevery person in the U. S. is using five times as much wood as he would\r\nuse if he lived in Europe. It is estimated that on an average each\r\nperson in this country uses annually the product of 25 acres of\r\nforest. _The country as a whole, cuts every year, between three and\r\nfour times more wood than all the forests grow in the meantime._\r\nBy contrast, the principal countries of Europe, cut just the annual\r\ngrowth, while Russia, Sweden and Japan, cut less than the growth. In\r\nother words, the 2,800,000,000,000 feet B.M. of the stumpage of the\r\nUnited States is a capital which is constantly drawn upon, whereas,\r\nthe 944,700,000,000 board feet of the forest of the German Empire is\r\na capital which is untouched but produces annually 300 board feet per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115. (Lumber Production by Regions, 1907).\r\n\r\nSouthern States include: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and\r\nOklahoma.\r\n\r\nPacific States include: Washington, Oregon and California.\r\n\r\nNorth Atlantic States include: New England, New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nNew Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland.\r\n\r\nLake States include: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.\r\n\r\nCentral States include: Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, and Missouri.\r\n\r\nRocky Mountain States include: Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah,\r\nColorado, Arizona, and New Mexico.]\r\n\r\nOne striking evidence of the decrease of the timber supply is the\r\nshifting of its sources. Once the northeastern States produced over\r\nhalf of the lumber product. They reached their relative maximum in\r\n1870 when they produced 36 per cent. At that time the Lake States\r\nproduced about 24 per cent. By 1890 the Lake States came to their\r\nmaximum of 36 per cent. Today the southern States are near their\r\nmaximum with 41 per cent., but the center will soon shift to the\r\nPacific States. Their product rose from less than 10 per cent. of the\r\nwhole in 1900 to 17 per cent. in 1908, Figs. 115 and 116. When\r\nthat virgin forest has been cut off, there will be no new region\r\nto exploit; whereas, heretofore, when a region was exhausted, the\r\nlumbermen have always had a new one to which to move. At the\r\nannual meeting of the Northern Pine Manufacturers' Association in\r\nMinneapolis, Minn., January 22, 1907, Secretary J. E. Rhodes made this\r\nstriking statement:\r\n\r\n    Since 1895, 248 firms, representing an annual aggregate\r\n    output of pine lumber of 4-1/4 billion feet, have retired from\r\n    business, due to the exhaustion of their timber supply. Plants\r\n    representing approximately 500 million feet capacity, which\r\n    sawed in 1906, will not be operated in 1907.\r\n\r\n    The shifting of the chief sources of supply has, of course,\r\n    been accompanied by a change in the kinds of lumber produced.\r\n    There was a time when white pine alone constituted one-half\r\n    of the total quantity. In 1900 this species furnished but 21.5\r\n    per cent., in 1904 only 15 per cent., of the lumber cut.[6] We\r\n    do not use less pine because we have found something better,\r\n    but because we have to put up with something worse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116. (Lumber Production by States).]\r\n\r\nThe present annual cut of southern yellow pine is about 13-1/4 million\r\nM feet, or a little less than one-third of the total cut of all the\r\nspecies. At the present rate of consumption, it is evident that within\r\nten or fifteen years, there will be a most serious shortage of it.\r\nMeanwhile the cut of Douglas fir on the Pacific coast has increased\r\nfrom 5 per cent. of the total lumber cut in 1900 to 12 per cent. in\r\n1905. This increase is in spite of the fact, already noted (p. 262)\r\nthat the great timber owning companies of the northwest are holding\r\ntheir stumpage for an expected great increase in value.\r\n\r\nAnother evidence of shortage is the almost total disappearance of\r\ncertain valuable species. Hickory, which once made American buggies\r\nfamous, is getting very scarce, and black walnut once commonly used\r\nfor furniture, is available now for only fine cabinet work, veneers,\r\ngun stocks, etc. Hardwoods that are fit for the saw are rapidly\r\ndecreasing. The hardwood cut of 1900 of 8,634,000 M feet diminished in\r\n1904 to 6,781,000 M feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117. (Lumber Production by Species).]\r\n\r\nA still further evidence of the decreasing supply, is the rising scale\r\nof prices. White pine, which sold for $45.00 per M during 1887-1892,\r\nsold for $100.00 f.o.b. N. Y., Jan. 1, 1911. Yellow poplar went up in\r\nthe same period, 1887-1911, from $29.00 to $63.00. Yellow pine rose\r\nfrom $18.00 in 1896 to $47.00 in 1911, and hemlock, the meanest of all\r\nwoods, from $11.50 in 1889 to $21.00 in 1911, Fig. 118.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118. Wholesale lumber prices, 1887-1911.\r\n\r\nThe qualities of lumber shown in the above chart are as follows:\r\n\r\nWhite Ash, 1st and 2d, 1\" and 1-1/2\" x 8\" and up by 12'-16'.\r\n\r\nBasswood, 1st and 2d, 1\" x 8\" and up by x 00\".\r\n\r\nWhite Oak, quarter-sawed, 1st and 2d, all figured, 1\" x 6\" and up x\r\n10'-16'.\r\n\r\nYellow poplar, 1st and 2d, 1\" x 7\"-17\" x 12'-16'.\r\n\r\nHemlock, boards\r\n\r\nSpruce, No. 1 and clear, 1\" and 1-1/4\" x 4\" x 13'.\r\n\r\nWhite pine, rough uppers, 1\" x 8\" and up x 00'.\r\n\r\nYellow pine, edge grain flooring. The curve is approximately correct,\r\nfor the standard of quality has been changed several times.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered, moreover, that as the timber in any region\r\nbecomes scarcer, the minimum cutting limit is constantly lowered, and\r\nthe standard of quality constantly depreciated. Poorer species\r\nand qualities and smaller sizes, which were once rejected, are now\r\naccepted in the market. For example, 6 inches is now a common cutting\r\ndiameter for pine and spruce, whereas 12 inches was the minimum limit,\r\nand on the Pacific coast there is still nothing cut below 18 inches.\r\nThis cutting of smaller sizes is largely due to the capacious maw of\r\nthe pulp mill, which swallows even the poorest stuff. Altho the amount\r\nof wood used for paper pulp is small in comparison with the total\r\nlumber production, being about 5.4 per cent., yet this cutting\r\nof young growth keeps the forest land devastated. In 1906 nearly\r\n9,000,000 tons of wood were used for paper pulp in the United States.\r\n\r\n    No one who is at all familiar with the situation doubts for an\r\n    instant that we are rapidly using up our _forest capital_. In\r\n    fact it is unquestionably safe to say that our present annual\r\n    consumption of wood in all forms is _from three to four times\r\n    as great as the annual increment of our forests_. Even\r\n    by accepting the highest estimate of the amount of timber\r\n    standing we postpone for only a few years the time when there\r\n    must be a great curtailment in the use of wood, if the present\r\n    methods of forest exploitation are continued. Every indication\r\n    points to the fact that under present conditions the maximum\r\n    annual yield of forest products for the country as a whole has\r\n    been reached, and that in a comparatively short time, there\r\n    will be a marked decrease in the total output, as there is now\r\n    in several items. (Kellogg, _Forestry Circular_, No. 97, p.\r\n    12.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is to be remembered that there are influences\r\nwhich tend to save and extend the forest area. These will be\r\nconsidered in the next chapter, on the Use of the Forest.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1:\r\n\r\n    LOOK OUT FOR FIRE!\r\n\r\n    RULES AND LAWS.\r\n\r\n    Fires for clearing land near a forest must not be started\r\n    until the trees are in full leaf.

After such fires are\r\n    lighted, competent persons must remain to guard them until the\r\n    fire is completely extinguished, and the persons starting such\r\n    fires will be held responsible for all damages notwithstanding\r\n    notice had been given to the Firewarden.\r\n\r\n    Fires will be permitted for the purposes of cooking, warmth\r\n    and insect smudges, but before such fires are kindled,\r\n    sufficient space around the spot where the fire is to be\r\n    lighted must be cleared from all combustible material; and\r\n    before the place is abandoned, fires so lighted must be\r\n    thoroly quenched.\r\n\r\n    All fires other than those hereinbefore mentioned are\r\n    absolutely prohibited.\r\n\r\n    Hunters and smokers are cautioned against allowing fires to\r\n    originate from the use of firearms, cigars and pipes.\r\n\r\n    Especial care should be taken that lighted matches are\r\n    extinguished before throwing them down.\r\n\r\n    All persons are warned that they will be held responsible for\r\n    any damage or injury to the forest which may result from their\r\n    carelessness or neglect.\r\n\r\n    Girdling and peeling bark from standing trees on state land is\r\n    prohibited.

He has exerted and is more and more exerting influences\r\nwhich while still enabling him to use the forest, also preserve\r\nand improve it. These activities may all be included under the term\r\nForestry.\r\n\r\nThe objects of modern forestry then are threefold: 1. The\r\n_utilization_ of the forest and its products, the main object; 2. The\r\n_preservation_ of the forest, _i.e._, its continued reproduction; 3.\r\nThe _improvement_ of the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTILIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the forest are threefold: (1) Protective, (2) Productive,\r\nand (3) Esthetic.\r\n\r\n(1) _Protective._ The forest may be used as a protection against\r\nfloods, wind, shifting sand, heat, drought, etc. The National Forests\r\nof the United States, Fig. 119, with the state forests, which include\r\none-fifth of the total forest area, are largely treated as \"protection\r\nforests\" to maintain the head waters of streams, Fig. 120, used for\r\nirrigation, for power or for commerce. The attempt now being made to\r\nreserve large areas in the White Mountains and southern Appalachians\r\nis chiefly for this purpose of protection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119. National Forests in the United States.]\r\n\r\nA comparison of Figs. 120 and 121 shows clearly the difference between\r\na region protected by forest and one unprotected.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120. A Protection Forest, Maintaining the\r\nHeadwaters of Streams. North Carolina. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121. Hillside Erosion. North Carolina. _U. S.\r\nForest Service_]\r\n\r\n(2) _Productive._ All practical foresters have as their first aim\r\nthe _yield_ of the forest. This distinguishes forestry from landscape\r\narchitecture, the object of which may equally be the preservation and\r\nimprovement of a given tract. The crop to be produced is as truly the\r\nprime concern of the forester as the raising of agricultural crops is\r\nthe prime concern of the farmer. It is for this reason that forestry\r\nis said to be the same thing as conservative lumbering, Fig. 122.\r\nThe prejudice of lumbermen against forestry has arisen from a\r\nmisunderstanding of its aim. Its aim is not to prevent the cutting\r\ndown of trees, but to direct their cutting in such ways that in the\r\nfuture there will still be trees to cut. \"Thru use to a greater use,\"\r\nis the motto of the Forest Service. The difference between destructive\r\nlumbering and conservative lumbering is that the former cuts one crop\r\nregardless of the future; while the latter plans to cut crop after\r\ncrop indefinitely. In other words, in conservative lumbering, the\r\ntrees to be cut are not selected solely with reference to their\r\nimmediate market value. Not one crop, but many, is the forester's\r\nmotto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122. Conservative Lumbering. Black Hills National\r\nForest, South Dakota. Note the brush, cord-wood, and logs piled\r\nseparately,--a fine clean-up. Nothing cut below 12\" diameter. _U. S.\r\nForest Service._]\r\n\r\nSo long as the supply seemed exhaustless, forests might be and were\r\ntreated as mines are, _i.e._, exploited for the sake of immediate\r\nprofit; but now that lumbermen begin to realize that the end of the\r\nsupply is in sight, more conservative methods are being adopted. We\r\ncannot afford to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. In order\r\nthen to obtain as rich harvests as possible, the modern forester makes\r\nuse of various methods, some negative, some positive.\r\n\r\nWaste is avoided in all possible ways, stumps are cut low and tops\r\nhigh on the trunk, first class trees are not used for skids, bridges,\r\nroads, etc., care is taken in \"falling\" trees and in dragging out\r\nlogs, that they will not injure other trees. Just as economical\r\ndisposal of the log has already been carried to a high degree of\r\nperfection in the saw-mill, (see _Handwork in Wood_, Chapter II,) so\r\none object of forestry is to carry this economy back into the woods.\r\n\r\nOne of the underlying ideas in conservative lumbering is that the\r\n\"yield,\" _i.e._, the amount of wood taken out of a healthy forest\r\nin a given time, shall be equal to the amount grown during the same\r\nperiod. If less is taken out than grows, some trees will overmature\r\nand decay; if more is taken out than grows, the forest will ultimately\r\nbe exhausted.\r\n\r\nThis principle may be carried out in a number of ways; but in any case\r\nit is necessary to know how fast the forest is reproducing itself, and\r\nthis is one of the functions of the forester. The United States\r\nForest Service makes a definite offer of cooperation with farmers and\r\nlumbermen and owners of forests to provide them with skilled foresters\r\nfor direction in this matter.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the most practicable way of determining the\r\nyield is by area, _i.e._, a certain fraction of a forest is to be\r\ncut over once in a given length of time, a year or longer. The time\r\nbetween two successive cuttings on the same area must be long enough\r\nto allow the young trees left standing to ripen.\r\n\r\nIn a word, conservative lumbering involves (1) the treatment of the\r\nforest as a source of crops, (2) systematic gathering, and (3) young\r\ngrowth so left as to replace the outgo.\r\n\r\nThe important place that forests fill in the national economy may\r\nbe realized partly by the citation of a few facts as to the forest\r\nproducts. The lumber industry is the fourth in value of products\r\namong the great manufacturing industries of the United States,\r\nbeing exceeded only by the iron and steel, the textile, and the meat\r\nindustries. It turns out a finished product worth $567,000,000.00. And\r\nyet lumber constitutes only about one-half of the value of the total\r\noutput of forest products. Its annual value is three-fourths of a\r\nbillion dollars, ($666,641,367 in 1907,) while the annual value of\r\nwood fuel, is $350,000,000. More than two-thirds of the people burn\r\nwood for fuel. The next largest single item in the list is shingles\r\nand laths, $32,000,000. (See _Forestry Bulletin_ No. 74, p. 7.)\r\n\r\n    Outside of food products, no material is so universally\r\n    used and so indispensable in human economy as wood. (Fernow,\r\n    _Econ._, p. 21.)\r\n\r\nThe importance of forest products may also be learned from a mere list\r\nof the varied uses to which they are put. Such a list would include:\r\nfuel, wood and charcoal; houses (over half the population of the\r\nUnited States live in wooden houses); the wooden parts of masonry and\r\nsteel buildings; scaffolding; barns, sheds and outhouses; ships, with\r\nall their parts, and the masts and trim of steel ships, boats\r\nand canoes; oars and paddles; railway ties (annual expenditure\r\n$50,000,000), railway cars, a million in number; trestles and bridges\r\n(more than 2,000 miles in length); posts and fencing; cooperage\r\nstock (low estimate, $25,000,000 annually); packing crates, including\r\ncoffins; baskets; electric wire poles (annual cost about $10,000,000);\r\npiles and submerged structures, like canal locks and water-wheels;\r\nwindmills; mining timbers (yearly cost, $7,500,000), indispensable\r\nin all mining operations (for every 100 tons of coal mined, 2 tons of\r\nmining timber are needed); street paving; veneers ($5,000,000.00 worth\r\nmade annually); vehicles, including carriages, wagons, automobiles\r\nand sleighs; furniture; machines and their parts; patterns for metal\r\nmolding; tools and tool handles; musical instruments; cigar boxes;\r\nmatches; toothpicks; pencils; (315 million a year in the U. S.,\r\nrequiring over 7 million cubic feet of wood); engraving blocks;\r\nshoe lasts, shoe trees and parts of shoes; hat blocks; agricultural\r\nimplements; hop and bean poles; playthings and toys, for both children\r\nand adults; Christmas trees and decorations; pipes; walking sticks;\r\numbrella handles; crutches and artificial limbs; household utensils;\r\nexcelsior.\r\n\r\nProducts other than wood: Turpentine and resin (worth $20,000,000 a\r\nyear); tar; oils; tan-bark, 1-1/2 million cords (worth $13,000,000\r\na year); wood alcohol; wood pulp (worth $15,000,000 a year); nuts;\r\ncellulose for collars, combs and car wheels; balsam, medicines;\r\nlampblack; dyes; paper fiber (xylolin) for textiles; shellac and\r\nvarnish ($8,500,000 worth imported in 1907); vinegar and acetic acid;\r\nconfections (including maple sugar and syrup at $2,500,000 a year).\r\n\r\n(3) The _Esthetic_ and sentimental uses of the forest, tho not to\r\nbe estimated in dollars and cents, are nevertheless of incalculable\r\nbenefit to the community. They would include the use of the forest\r\nas pleasure grounds, for hunting, fishing, camping, photography, and\r\ngeneral sightseeing. Notable instances of the growing appreciation of\r\nthese uses of the forest are the reservation of the Yellowstone and\r\nYosemite Parks as pleasure grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe second object of forestry is the preservation of the forest, or\r\ncontinued reproduction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to obtaining crops of trees, the forester plans to keep\r\nthe forest in such condition that it will constantly reproduce itself\r\nand never become exhausted.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that no forests are to be cut down, or that a given\r\narea, once a forest, is to be always a forest. Just as the individual\r\nfarmer needs some land for fields, some for pasture, and some for\r\nwoodlots, so the nation needs some for cities, some for farms, some\r\nfor pleasure grounds, and some for forests. But it does mean that\r\nfruitful forests shall not be turned into wildernesses as thousands of\r\nsquare miles now are, by the methods of destructive lumbering.\r\n\r\nIn general, better land is necessary for agriculture than for\r\nforestry, and it is therefore only the part of wisdom to use the\r\nbetter land for fields and reserve the poorer land for forests. There\r\nare in the United States enormous regions that are fit for nothing but\r\nforests, but many of these, as in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan,\r\nhave simply been denuded of their trees and no provision has been made\r\nfor their reproduction. This then is the second aim of forestry,--to\r\ntreat the forest so that it will continue to reproduce itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain this result, certain forest conditions have to be\r\npreserved. What these conditions are, we have already noticed (see\r\nChap. V, The Forest Organism). They are partly topographical and\r\nclimatic and partly historical. They include such factors as, soil,\r\nmoisture, temperature, and light, the forest cover, the forest floor,\r\nthe density and mixture of growth, all conditions of forest growth.\r\nIt is only as the forester preserves these conditions, or to put it\r\notherwise, it is only as he obeys the laws of the forest organism that\r\nhe can preserve the forest. For a long period of our national history,\r\nwe Americans were compelled to conform our life and institutions to\r\nthe presence of the primeval forest, but by long observation of what\r\nhappens naturally in the forest, there have been developed in Europe\r\nand in America certain ways of handling it so as to make it our\r\nservant and not our master.\r\n\r\nThese ways are called silvicultural systems. They are all based on the\r\nnature of the forest itself, and they succeed only because they are\r\nmodifications of what takes place naturally in the woods.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen above (p. 220) trees reproduce themselves either by\r\nsprouts or by seeds. This fact gives rise to two general methods of\r\nreproduction, called the coppice systems and the seed systems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123. Chestnut Coppice. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Coppice_, Fig. 123. In the simpler form of this system, the forest\r\nis divided into a certain number of parts, say thirty, and one part is\r\ncut down each year. New sprouts at once start up, which will mature\r\na year later than those in the part cut the previous year. Where the\r\ntrees of each part are thirty years old at cutting, thirty years is\r\ncalled the \"rotation period.\" The coppice is said to be managed on\r\na thirty-year rotation. The system is widely used in eastern United\r\nStates, for fuel, posts, charcoal, railway ties, and other small\r\nstuff, as well as for tan-bark. This system is modified by maintaining\r\nan overwood composed of seedling trees or selected sprouts above a\r\nstand of sprouts. This is called the Reserve Sprout method and is used\r\nwith admirable results by the French.\r\n\r\n_Seed Forests._ In contrast with coppice forests, those raised from\r\nseeds produce the best class of timber, such as is used for saw logs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124. Seeding from the Side. White Pine. New\r\nHampshire. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Seeding from the side_, Fig. 124. Many forests naturally spread at\r\ntheir borders from the scattering of their seeds. \"Old field pine\" is\r\nso called from its tendency to spread in this way on old fields. This\r\nnatural \"Seeding from the Side\" has given rise to the \"Group System,\"\r\nin which an area of ripe trees is cut off and the trees alongside are\r\ndepended upon to reproduce new ones on the cut-over area. The openings\r\nare gradually enlarged until all the old timber is cut out, and the\r\nyoung growth has taken its place. In its best form there is a definite\r\n\"rotation period,\" say eighty years. This system is simple, safe, and\r\nvery useful, especially for small openings in woodlots. A modification\r\nof this is the \"Strip System,\" in which long narrow openings, say\r\nseventy-five yards wide, are cut out and gradually widened. The strips\r\nare cut in the proper direction so that the prevailing winds will\r\ncross them, both for the sake of avoiding windfalls and to help\r\nscatter the seed. Where the soil is very dry, the strips may run east\r\nand west to protect the seedlings from the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125. Virgin Forest, Trees of All Ages. Jackson\r\nCo., North Carolina. _U.S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Selection Forests._ The typical virgin forest, Fig. 125, is one in\r\nwhich trees of all ages are closely intermingled, and it may be either\r\n\"mixed\" or \"pure.\" If a farmer had a woodlot of this character and\r\nevery year went over it with the ax, cutting out such trees as he\r\nneeded for his purpose, and also trees whose removal would improve the\r\nwoods, but taking care not to cut out each year more than the amount\r\nof the average growth, he would be using the \"Selection System.\" This\r\nsystem is the best way of keeping a forest dense and of preserving\r\none which is difficult to start afresh, as on a mountain slope; it is\r\npracticable where the woods are small or under a high state of care,\r\nas in Europe, where this system has been in use for seven centuries.\r\nBut the cost of road maintenance and of logging is high and it is\r\ntherefore impracticable in most lumber regions in the United States,\r\nexcept for woods of especial value, like black walnut.\r\n\r\n_Localized Selection._ If instead of the whole forest being treated in\r\nthis way every year, it were divided up into perhaps twenty parts, and\r\nfrom each part there were taken out each year as much lumber as would\r\nequal the annual growth of the whole forest, such a system would be\r\ncalled \"Localized Selection.\" The cost of logging would be greatly\r\nreduced and if care were taken to leave standing some seed trees and\r\nto cut no trees below a determined size, as twelve inches, the forest\r\nwould maintain itself in good condition. This system has been applied\r\nwith great success in certain private forests in the Adirondacks.\r\n\r\n_Regular Seed Forest or High Forest._ In the system already mentioned\r\nabove of seeding from the side, the trees near the cut areas are\r\ndepended upon to seed these areas. Moreover, no especial pains are\r\ntaken to preserve the forest floor and the forest cover. But all trees\r\ndo not bear seeds annually, nor do their seedlings thrive under such\r\nconditions. In other words, in some forests especial pains must\r\nbe taken to secure reproduction, and the forest conditions must\r\nbe maintained with special reference to the growing crop. For this\r\npurpose, the cuttings take place thru a series of years, sometimes\r\nlasting even twenty years. These reproduction cuttings have reference,\r\nnow to a stimulus to the seed trees, now to the preparation of the\r\nseed bed, now to the encouragement of the seedlings. Then later,\r\nthe old crop is gradually cut away. Later still, in twenty or thirty\r\nyears, the new forest is thinned, and when it reaches maturity,\r\nperhaps in one hundred or two hundred years, the process is repeated.\r\nThis is called the \"Regular Seed Forest.\" It produces very valuable\r\ntimber, and has been used for a long time in Switzerland, especially\r\nfor beech and balsam.\r\n\r\nThe system is complicated and therefore unsafe in ignorant hands, and\r\nthe logging is expensive.\r\n\r\n_Two-storied Seed Forest._ A modification of the system of Regular\r\nSeed Forest is the planting of another and a tolerant species of tree\r\nunder older intolerant trees to make a cover for the soil, to prevent\r\nthe growth of grass and weeds, and to improve the quality of the upper\r\ngrowth.[2]\r\n\r\nAn illustration of a natural two-storied seed forest is shown in Fig.\r\n126.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 126. Two-storied Seed Forest. Fir under Beech,\r\nGermany. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n_Planting._ The planting of forest trees is a comparatively\r\nunimportant part of modern forestry. It is a mistaken idea, not\r\nuncommon, that the usual way of reproducing forests is to plant trees.\r\nIt is true that in the pineries of North Germany and in the spruce\r\nforests of Saxony, it is common to cut clean and then replant, but it\r\nis absurd to conclude, as some have done, that forestry consists of\r\nplanting a tree every time one is cut. Even if planting were the best\r\nmethod, many more than one tree would have to be planted for each one\r\ncut, in order to maintain the forest. So far as America is concerned,\r\nnot for a long time will planting be much used for reproduction.\r\n\r\n    The greater portion of American woodlands is in the\r\n    condition of culled forests, that is, forests from which\r\n    the merchantable trees have been cut, leaving the younger\r\n    individuals, as well as all trees belonging to unmarketable\r\n    species. Even on the areas where the lumbermen have made a\r\n    clean cut of the original timber, new trees will come up of\r\n    themselves from seeds blown from the surrounding forests or\r\n    falling from occasional individuals left standing. (Bruncken,\r\n    p. 133.)\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of planting in America is mainly for reclaiming\r\ntreeless regions, as in the west, and where timber is high priced.\r\nThe area of planted timber in the Middle West aggregates many hundred\r\nthousand acres, once waste land, now converted into useful woods.[3]\r\n\r\nPlanting has been made possible in the far west by extensive\r\nirrigation systems, and farther east by the lessening of prairie\r\nfires, which once set the limit to tree growth in the prairie states.\r\nIn many parts of Illinois, southern Wisconsin and other prairie\r\nStates, there is much more forest land than there was twenty-five\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nWhat planting can do, may be seen on some worn out pastures in New\r\nEngland, Fig. 127. With the western movement of agriculture,\r\nthe abandoned farms of New England are to some extent becoming\r\nre-forested, both naturally and by planting, as with white pine, which\r\ngrows even on sandy soil. Between 1820 and 1880, there was a period of\r\nenthusiastic white-pine planting in New England, and tho the interest\r\ndied on account of the cheap transportation of western lumber, those\r\nearly plantations prove that white pine can be planted at a profit\r\neven on sand barrens. Once worn out and useless pastures are now worth\r\n$150 an acre and produce yearly a net income of $3 or more an acre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127. Planted White Pine, Fifty Years Old,\r\nBridgewater, Mass. _U. S. Forest Service._]\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT.\r\n\r\nBesides utilization and preservation, the third main object of\r\nforestry is the improvement of the forest. It is not an uncommon\r\nmistake to suppose that the virgin forest is the best forest for human\r\npurposes. It is a comparatively new idea, especially in America, that\r\na forest can be improved; that is, that better trees can be raised\r\nthan those which grow naturally. Lumbermen commonly say, \"You never\r\ncan raise a second growth of white pine as good as the first growth.\"\r\nAs if this \"first growth\" were not itself the successsor of thousands\r\nof other generations! There is even a legend that white pine will not\r\ngrow in its old habitat. Says Bruncken,\r\n\r\n    Many people probably imagine that a primeval wood, \"by\r\n    nature's own hand planted,\" cannot be surpassed in the number\r\n    and size of its trees, and consequently in the amount of wood\r\n    to be derived from it. But the very opposite is true. No wild\r\n    forest can ever equal a cultivated one in productiveness. To\r\n    hope that it will, is very much as if a farmer were to expect\r\n    a full harvest from the grain that may spring up spontaneously\r\n    in his fields without his sowing. A tract of wild forest in\r\n    the first place does not contain so many trees as might grow\r\n    thereon, but only so many as may have survived the struggle\r\n    for life with their own and other species of plants occupying\r\n    the locality. Many of the trees so surviving never attain\r\n    their best development, being suppressed, overshadowed, and\r\n    hindered by stronger neighbors. Finally much of the space that\r\n    might be occupied by valuable timber may be given up to trees\r\n    having little or no market value. The rule is universal that\r\n    the amount and value of material that can be taken from an\r\n    area of wild forest remains far behind what the same land\r\n    may bear if properly treated by the forester. It is certain,\r\n    therefore, that in the future, when most American forests\r\n    shall be in a high state of cultivation, the annual output of\r\n    forests will, from a much restricted area, exceed everything\r\n    known at the present day. (Bruncken, _North American Forests\r\n    and Forestry_, pp. 134-135.)\r\n\r\n    It is probable that the virgin forest produces but a tithe of\r\n    the useful material which it is capable of producing. (Fernow,\r\n    p. 98.)\r\n\r\n    Mr. Burbank has demonstrated that trees can be bred for any\r\n    particular quality,--for largeness, strength, shape, amount of\r\n    pitch, tannin, sugar and the like, and for rapidity of\r\n    growth; in fact that any desirable attribute of a tree may\r\n    be developed simply by breeding and selecting. He has created\r\n    walnut trees, by crossing common varieties, that have grown\r\n    six times as much in thirteen years as their ancestors did in\r\n    twenty-eight years, preserving at the same time, the strength,\r\n    hardness and texture of their forebears. The grain of the wood\r\n    has been made more beautiful at the same time. The trees are\r\n    fine for fuel and splendidly adapted to furniture manufacture.\r\n    (Harwood, _The New Earth_, p. 179.)\r\n\r\nNature provides in the forest merely those varieties that will\r\nsurvive. Man, by interfering in Nature's processes but obeying her\r\nlaws, raises what he wants. Nature says: those trees that survive\r\nare fit and does not care whether the trees be straight or crooked,\r\nbranched or clear. Man says: those trees shall survive which are fit\r\nfor human uses. Man raises better grains and fruits and vegetables\r\nthan Nature, unaided, can, and, in Europe, better trees for lumber. In\r\nAmerica there has been such an abundance of trees good enough for our\r\npurposes that we have simply gone out and gathered them, just as a\r\nsavage goes out to gather berries and nuts. Some day our descendants\r\nwill smile at our treatment of forests much as we smile at\r\nroot-digging savages, unless, indeed, we so far destroy the forests\r\nthat they will be more angered than amused. In Europe and Japan, the\r\noriginal supply of trees having been exhausted, forests have been\r\ncultivated for centuries with the purpose of raising crops larger in\r\nquantity and better in quality.\r\n\r\nThere are various methods used in forest improvement. Improvement\r\ncuttings, as the name implies, are cuttings made to improve the\r\nquality of the forest, whether by thinning out poor species of trees,\r\nunsound trees, trees crowding more valuable ones, or trees called\r\n\"wolves\"; that is, trees unduly overshadowing others. Improvement\r\ncuttings are often necessary as a preliminary step before any\r\nsilvicultural system can be applied. Indeed, many of the silvicultural\r\nsystems involve steady improvement of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe pruning of branches is a method of improvement, carrying on the\r\nnatural method by which trees in a forest clean themselves of their\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nSeeds of valuable species are often sowed, when the conditions are\r\nproper, in order to introduce a valuable species, just as brooks\r\nand ponds are stocked with fine fish. In general it may be said that\r\nimprovement methods are only in their infancy, especially in America.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: A concise and interesting statement of the\r\n    relation of the forest to rain and floods is to be found in\r\n    Pinchot: _Primer of Forestry_, Bulletin No. 24, Part II, Chap.\r\n    III.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: For an interesting account of an application of\r\n    this method, see Ward, p. 35.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: To encourage such forest extension, the Forest\r\n    Service is doing much by the publication of bulletins\r\n    recommending methods and trees suited to special regions, as,\r\n    e.g., on Forest Planting in Illinois, in the Sand Hill Region\r\n    of Nebraska, on Coal Lands in Western Pennsylvania, in Western\r\n    Kansas, in Oklahoma and adjacent regions, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF THE FOREST.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:[A]\r\n\r\n\r\n  I Utilization.\r\n\r\n      Pinchot, _Primer_, II, pp. 14-18, 38-48.\r\n      Bruncken, pp. 121-131, _For.

E. FERNOW AND FILIBERT ROTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carpenter or other artisan who handles different woods, becomes\r\nfamiliar with those he employs frequently, and learns to distinguish\r\nthem thru this familiarity, without usually being able to state the\r\npoints of distinction. If a wood comes before him with which he is not\r\nfamiliar, he has, of course, no means of determining what it is, and\r\nit is possible to select pieces even of those with which he is well\r\nacquainted, different in appearance from the general run, that will\r\nmake him doubtful as to their identification. Furthermore, he may\r\ndistinguish between hard and soft pines, between oak and ash, or\r\nbetween maple and birch, which are characteristically different; but\r\nwhen it comes to distinguishing between the several species of pine or\r\noak or ash or birch, the absence of readily recognizable characters is\r\nsuch that but few practitioners can be relied upon to do it. Hence, in\r\nthe market we find many species mixed and sold indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nTo identify the different woods it is necessary to have a knowledge of\r\nthe definite, invariable differences in their structure, besides\r\nthat of the often variable differences in their appearance. These\r\nstructural differences may either be readily visible to the naked eye\r\nor with a magnifier, or they may require a microscopical examination.\r\nIn some cases such an examination can not be dispensed with, if we\r\nwould make absolutely sure. There are instances, as in the pines,\r\nwhere even our knowledge of the minute anatomical structure is not yet\r\nsufficient to make a sure identification.\r\n\r\nIn the following key an attempt has been made--the first, so far as\r\nwe know, in English literature--to give a synoptical view of the\r\ndistinctive features of the commoner woods of the United States, which\r\nare found in the markets or are used in the arts. It will be observed\r\nthat the distinction has been carried in most instances no further\r\nthan to genera or classes of woods, since the distinction of species\r\ncan hardly be accomplished without elaborate microscopic study, and\r\nalso that, as far as possible, reliance has been placed only on such\r\ncharacteristics as can be distinguished with the naked eye or a simple\r\nmagnifying glass, in order to make the key useful to the largest\r\nnumber. Recourse has also been taken for the same reason to the less\r\nreliable and more variable general external appearance, color, taste,\r\nsmell, weight, etc.\r\n\r\nThe user of the key must, however, realize that external appearance,\r\nsuch, for example, as color, is not only very variable but also very\r\ndifficult to describe, individual observers differing especially in\r\nseeing and describing shades of color. The same is true of statements\r\nof size, when relative, and not accurately measured, while weight and\r\nhardness can perhaps be more readily approximated. Whether any feature\r\nis distinctly or only indistinctly seen will also depend somewhat\r\non individual eyesight, opinion, or practice. In some cases the\r\nresemblance of different species is so close that only one other\r\nexpedient will make distinction possible, namely, a knowledge of the\r\nregion from which the wood has come. We know, for instance, that no\r\nlongleaf pine grows in Arkansas and that no white pine can come from\r\nAlabama, and we can separate the white cedar, giant arbor vitae of the\r\nWest and the arbor vitae of the Northeast, only by the difference of\r\nthe locality from which the specimen comes. With all these limitations\r\nproperly appreciated, the key will be found helpful toward greater\r\nfamiliarity with the woods which are more commonly met with.\r\n\r\nThe features which have been utilized in the key and with which--their\r\nnames as well as their appearance--therefore, the reader must\r\nfamiliarize himself before attempting to use the key, are mostly\r\ndescribed as they appear in cross-section. They are:\r\n\r\n(1) Sap-wood and heart-wood (see p. 17), the former being the wood\r\nfrom the outer and the latter from the inner part of the tree. In some\r\ncases they differ only in shade, and in others in kind of color, the\r\nheart-wood exhibiting either a darker shade or a pronounced color.\r\nSince one can not always have the two together, or be certain whether\r\nhe has sap-wood or heart-wood, reliance upon this feature is, to\r\nbe sure, unsatisfactory, yet sometimes it is the only general\r\ncharacteristic that can be relied upon. If further assurance is\r\ndesired, microscopic structure must be examined; in such cases\r\nreference has been made to the presence or absence of tracheids in\r\npith rays and the structure of their walls, especially projections and\r\nspirals.\r\n\r\n(2) Annual rings, their formation having been described on page 19.\r\n(See also Figs. 128-130.) They are more or less distinctly marked,\r\nand by such marking a classification of three great groups of wood is\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n(3) Spring wood and summer wood, the former being the interior (first\r\nformed wood of the year), the latter the exterior (last formed) part\r\nof the ring. The proportion of each and the manner in which the one\r\nmerges into the other are sometimes used, but more frequently the\r\nmanner in which the pores appear distributed in either.\r\n\r\n(4) Pores, which are vessels cut thru, appearing as holes in\r\ncross-section, in longitudinal section as channels, scratches, or\r\nidentifications. (See p. 23 and Figs. 129 and 130.) They appear\r\nonly in the broad-leaved, so called, hard woods; their relative size\r\n(large, medium, small, minute, and indistinct when they cease to be\r\nvisible individually by the naked eye) and manner of distribution in\r\nthe ring being of much importance, and especially in the summer\r\nwood, where they appear singly, in groups, or short broken lines, in\r\ncontinuous concentric, often wavy lines, or in radial branching lines.\r\n\r\n(5) Resin ducts (see p. 26 and Fig. 128) which appear very much like\r\npores in cross-section, namely, as holes or lighter or darker colored\r\ndots, but much more scattered. They occur only in coniferous woods,\r\nand their presence or absence, size, number, and distribution are an\r\nimportant distinction in these woods.\r\n\r\n(6) Pith rays (see p. 21 and Figs. 129 and 130), which in\r\ncross-section appear as radial lines, and in radial section as\r\ninterrupted bands of varying breadth, impart a peculiar luster to that\r\nsection in some woods. They are most readily visible with the naked\r\neye or with a magnifier in the broad-leaved woods. In coniferous\r\nwoods they are usually so fine and closely packed that to the casual\r\nobserver they do not appear. Their breadth and their greater or less\r\ndistinctness are used as distinguishing marks, being styled fine,\r\nbroad, distinct, very distinct, conspicuous, and indistinct when no\r\nlonger visible by the naked (strong) eye.\r\n\r\n(7) Concentric lines, appearing in the summer wood of certain species\r\nmore or less distinct, resembling distantly the lines of pores but\r\nmuch finer and not consisting of pores. (See Fig. 129.)\r\n\r\nOf microscopic features, the following only have been referred to:\r\n\r\n(8) Tracheids, a description of which is to be found on page 28.\r\n\r\n(9) Pits, simple and bordered, especially the number of simple pits\r\nin the cells of the pith rays, which lead into each of the adjoining\r\ntracheids.\r\n\r\nFor standards of weight, consult table on pages 50 and 192; for\r\nstandards of hardness, table on page 195.\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise stated the color refers always to the fresh\r\ncross-section of a piece of dry wood; sometimes distinct kinds of\r\ncolor, sometimes only shades, and often only general color effects\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: From Forestry Bulletin No. 10, _U. S. Department\r\n    of Agriculture_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE THE KEY.\r\n\r\nNobody need expect to be able to use successfully any key for the\r\ndistinction of woods or of any other class of natural objects without\r\nsome practice. This is especially true with regard to woods, which\r\nare apt to vary much, and when the key is based on such meager general\r\ndata as the present. The best course to adopt is to supply one's self\r\nwith a small sample collection of woods, accurately named. Small,\r\npolished tablets are of little use for this purpose. The pieces\r\nshould be large enough, if possible, to include pith and bark, and of\r\nsufficient width to permit ready inspection of the cross-section.\r\nBy examining these with the aid of the key, beginning with the\r\nbetter-known woods, one will soon learn to see the features described\r\nand to form an idea of the relative standards which the maker of the\r\nkey had in mind. To aid in this, the accompanying illustrations will\r\nbe of advantage. When the reader becomes familiar with the key, the\r\nwork of identifying any given piece will be comparatively easy. The\r\nmaterial to be examined must, of course, be suitably prepared. It\r\nshould be moistened; all cuts should be made with a very sharp knife\r\nor razor and be clean and smooth, for a bruised surface reveals but\r\nlittle structure. The most useful cut may be made along one of the\r\nedges. Instructive, thin, small sections may be made with a sharp\r\npenknife or razor, and when placed on a piece of thin glass, moistened\r\nand covered with another piece of glass, they may be examined by\r\nholding them toward the light.\r\n\r\nFinding, on examination with the magnifier, that it contains pores, we\r\nknow it is not coniferous or non-porous. Finding no pores collected\r\nin the spring-wood portion of the annual ring, but all scattered\r\n(diffused) thru the ring, we turn at once to the class of\r\n\"Diffuse-porous woods.\" We now note the size and manner in which\r\nthe pores are distributed thru the ring. Finding them very small and\r\nneither conspicuously grouped, nor larger nor more abundant in the\r\nspring-wood, we turn to the third group of this class. We now note\r\nthe pith rays, and finding them neither broad nor conspicuous, but\r\ndifficult to distinguish, even with the magnifier, we at once exclude\r\nthe wood from the first two sections of this group and place it in the\r\nthird, which is represented by only one kind, cottonwood. Finding the\r\nwood very soft, white, and on the longitudinal section with a silky\r\nluster, we are further assured that our determination is correct.\r\nWe may now turn to the list of woods and obtain further information\r\nregarding the occurrence, qualities, and uses of the wood.\r\n\r\nSometimes our progress is not so easy; we may waver in what group or\r\nsection to place the wood before us. In such cases we may try each\r\nof the doubtful roads until we reach a point where we find ourselves\r\nentirely wrong and then return and take up another line; or we may\r\nanticipate some of the later mentioned features and finding them apply\r\nto our specimen, gain additional assurance of the direction we ought\r\nto travel. Color will often help us to arrive at a speedy decision.\r\nIn many cases, especially with conifers, which are rather difficult to\r\ndistinguish, a knowledge of the locality from which the specimen comes\r\nis at once decisive. Thus, northern white cedar, and bald cypress, and\r\nthe cedar of the Pacific will be identified, even without the somewhat\r\nindefinite criteria given in the key.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY TO THE MORE IMPORTANT WOODS OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nI.

They are\r\n    often much more easily seen on radial, and still more so on\r\n    tangential sections, appearing there as fine lines or dots of\r\n    open structure of different color or as indentations or pin\r\n    scratches in a longitudinal direction.]\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES FOR DISTINCTIONS IN THE GROUP.\r\n\r\nSpruce is hardly distinguishable from fir, except by the existence of\r\nthe resin ducts, and microscopically by the presence of tracheids\r\nin the medullary rays. Spruce may also be confounded with soft pine,\r\nexcept for the heart-wood color of the latter and the larger, more\r\nfrequent, and more readily visible resin ducts.\r\n\r\nIn the lumber yard, hemlock is usually recognized by color and the\r\nsilvery character of its surface. Western hemlocks partake of this\r\nlast character to a less degree.\r\n\r\nMicroscopically the white pine can be distinguished by having usually\r\nonly one large pit, while spruce shows three to five very small\r\npits in the parenchyma cells of the pith ray communicating with the\r\ntracheid.\r\n\r\nThe distinction of the pines is possible only by microscopic\r\nexamination. The following distinctive features may assist in\r\nrecognizing, when in the log or lumber pile, those usually found in\r\nthe market:\r\n\r\nThe light, straw color, combined with great lightness and softness,\r\ndistinguishes the white pines (white pine and sugar pine) from the\r\nhard pines (all others in the market), which may also be recognized\r\nby the gradual change of spring wood into summer wood. This change\r\nin hard pines is abrupt, making the summer wood appear as a sharply\r\ndefined and more or less broad band.\r\n\r\nThe Norway pine, which may be confounded with the shortleaf pine, can\r\nbe distinguished by being much lighter and softer. It may also,\r\nbut more rarely, be confounded with heavier white pine, but for the\r\nsharper definition of the annual ring, weight, and hardness.\r\n\r\nThe longleaf pine is strikingly heavy, hard, and resinous, and usually\r\nvery regular and narrow ringed, showing little sap-wood, and differing\r\nin this respect from the shortleaf pine and loblolly pine, which\r\nusually have wider rings and more sap-wood, the latter excelling in\r\nthat respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following convenient and useful classification of pines into four\r\ngroups, proposed by Dr. H. Mayr, is based on the appearance of the\r\npith ray as seen in a radial section of the spring wood of any ring:\r\n\r\nSection I. Walls of the tracheids of the pith ray with dentate\r\n           projections.\r\n\r\n   _a._ One to two large, simple pits to each tracheid on the radial\r\n        walls of the cells of the pith ray.--Group 1. Represented in\r\n        this country only by _P. resinosa_.\r\n\r\n   _b._ Three to six simple pits to each tracheid, on the walls of\r\n        the cells of the pith ray.--Group 2. _P. taeda_, _palustris_,\r\n        etc., including most of our \"hard\" and \"yellow\" pines.\r\n\r\nSection II. Walls of tracheids of pith ray smooth, without dentate\r\n            projections.\r\n\r\n   _a._ One or two large pits to each tracheid on the radial walls of\r\n        each cell of the pith ray.--Group 3. _P. strobus, lambertiana_,\r\n        and other true white pines.\r\n\r\n   _b._ Three to six small pits on the radial walls of each cell of\r\n        the pith ray. Group 4. _P. parryana_, and other nut pines,\r\n        including also _P. balfouriana_.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--RING-POROUS WOODS.\r\n\r\n(Some of Group D and cedar elm imperfectly ring-porous.)\r\n\r\nA.

The honey locust stands out by the conspicuousness of the\r\npith rays, especially on radial sections, on account of their height,\r\nwhile the black locust is distinguished by the extremely great weight\r\nand hardness, together with its darker brown color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131. Wood of Coffee Tree.]\r\n\r\nThe ashes, elms, hickories, and oaks may, on casual observation,\r\nappear to resemble one another on account of the pronounced zone of\r\nporous spring wood. (Figs. 129, 132, 135.) The sharply defined large\r\npith rays of the oak exclude these at once; the wavy lines of pores in\r\nthe summer wood, appearing as conspicuous finely-feathered hatchings\r\non tangential section, distinguish the elms; while the ashes differ\r\nfrom the hickory by the very conspicuously defined zone of spring wood\r\npores, which in hickory appear more or less interrupted. The reddish\r\nhue of the hickory and the more or less brown hue of the ash may also\r\naid in ready recognition. The smooth, radial surface of split hickory\r\nwill readily separate it from the rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132. _A_, black ash; _B_, white ash; _C_, green\r\nash.]\r\n\r\nThe different species of ash may be identified as follows (Fig. 132):\r\n\r\n  1. Pores in the summer wood more or less united into lines.\r\n\r\n    _a._ The lines short and broken, occurring mostly near the limit\r\n         of the ring .......................................WHITE ASH.\r\n\r\n    _b._ The lines quite long and conspicuous in most parts of the\r\n         summer wood .......................................GREEN ASH.\r\n\r\n  2. Pores in the summer wood not united into lines, or rarely so.\r\n\r\n    _a._ Heart-wood reddish brown and very firm ..............RED ASH.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Heart-wood grayish brown, and much more porous ....BLACK ASH.\r\n\r\nIn the oaks, two groups can be readily distinguished by the manner in\r\nwhich the pores are distributed in the summer wood. (Fig. 133.) In\r\nthe white oaks the pores are very fine and numerous and crowded in\r\nthe outer part of the summer wood, while in the black or red oaks the\r\npores are larger, few in number, and mostly isolated. The live oaks,\r\nas far as structure is concerned, belong to the black oaks, but are\r\nmuch less porous, and are exceedingly heavy and hard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133. Wood of Red Oak.

Pith rays fairly distinct, the pores rather few and not more\r\n     abundant in the spring wood: wood heavy, usually darker,\r\n                                        CHERRY BIRCH and YELLOW BIRCH.\r\n\r\n  2. Pith rays barely distinct, pores more numerous and commonly\r\n     forming a more porous spring wood zone; wood of medium weight,\r\n                                                 CANOE OR PAPER BIRCH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136. Wood of Beech, Sycamore and Birch.]\r\n\r\nThe species of maple may be distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n   1. Most of the pith rays broader than the pores and very\r\n      conspicuous ........................................SUGAR MAPLE.\r\n\r\n   2. Pith rays not or rarely broader than the pores, fine but\r\n      conspicuous.\r\n\r\n     _a._ Wood heavy and hard, usually of darker reddish color and\r\n           commonly spotted on cross-section ...............RED MAPLE.\r\n\r\n     _b._ Wood of medium weight and hardness, usually light colored.\r\n                                                         SILVER MAPLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137. Wood of Maple.]\r\n\r\nRed maple is not always safely distinguished from soft maple. In box\r\nelder the pores are finer and more numerous than in soft maple. The\r\nvarious species of elm may be distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n   1. Pores of spring wood form a broad band of several rows; easy\r\n      splitting, dark brown heart ............................RED ELM.\r\n\r\n   2.
