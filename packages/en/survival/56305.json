A\r\nlong course of reflective scrutiny of the lunar surface with the aid of\r\ntelescopes of considerable power, and a consequent familiarity with the\r\nwonderful details there presented, convinced us that there was yet\r\nsomething to be said about the moon, that existing works on Astronomy\r\ndid not contain. Much valuable labour has been bestowed upon the\r\ntopography of the moon, and this subject we do not pretend to advance.\r\nEnough has also been written for the benefit of those who desire an\r\nacquaintance with the intricate movements of the moon in space; and\r\naccordingly we pass this subject without notice. But very little has\r\nbeen written respecting the moon’s physiography, or the causative\r\nphenomena of the features, broad and detailed, that the surface of our\r\nsatellite presents for study. Our observations had led us to some\r\nconclusions, respecting the cause of volcanic energy and the mode of its\r\naction as manifested in the characteristic craters and other eruptive\r\nphenomena that abound upon the moon’s surface. We have endeavoured to\r\nexplain these phenomena by reference to a few natural laws, and to\r\nconnect them with the general hypothesis of planet formation which is\r\nnow widely accepted by cosmologists. The principal aim of our work is to\r\nlay these proffered explanations before the students and admirers of\r\nastronomy and science in general; and we trust that what we have deduced\r\nconcerning the moon may be taken as referring to a certain extent to\r\nother planets.\r\n\r\nSome reflections upon the moon considered as a world, in reference to\r\nquestions of habitability, and to the peculiar conditions which would\r\nattend a sojourn on the lunar surface, have appeared to us not\r\ninappropriate. These, though instructive, are rather curious than\r\nimportant. More worthy of respectful consideration are the few remarks\r\nwe have offered upon the moon as a satellite and a benefactor to the\r\ninhabitants of this Earth.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the Illustrations accompanying this work, more\r\nespecially those which represent certain portions of the lunar surface\r\nas they are revealed by the aid of powerful telescopes, such as those\r\nwhich we employed in our scrutiny, it is proper that we should say a few\r\nwords here on the means by which they have been produced.——\r\n\r\nDuring upwards of thirty years of assiduous observation, every\r\nfavourable opportunity has been seized to educate the eye not only in\r\nrespect to comprehending the general character of the moon’s surface,\r\nbut also to examining minutely its marvellous details under every\r\nvariety of phase, in the hope of rightly understanding their true nature\r\nas well as the causes which had produced them. This object was aided by\r\nmaking careful drawings of each portion or object when it was most\r\nfavourably presented in the telescope. These drawings were again and\r\nagain repeated, revised, and compared with the actual objects, the eye\r\nthus advancing in correctness and power of appreciating minute details,\r\nwhile the hand was acquiring, by assiduous practice, the art of\r\nrendering correct representations of the objects in view. In order to\r\npresent these Illustrations with as near an approach as possible to the\r\nabsolute integrity of the original objects, the idea occurred to us that\r\nby translating the drawings into models which, when placed in the sun’s\r\nrays, would faithfully reproduce the lunar effects of light and shadow,\r\nand then photographing the models so treated, we should produce most\r\nfaithful representations of the original. The result was in every way\r\nhighly satisfactory, and has yielded pictures of the details of the\r\nlunar surface such as we feel every confidence in submitting to those of\r\nour readers who have made a special study of the subject. It is hoped\r\nthat those also who have not had opportunity to become intimately\r\nacquainted with the details of the lunar surface, will be enabled to\r\nbecome so by aid of these Illustrations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we think it desirable to add that the photographic\r\nillustrations above referred to are printed by well-established pigment\r\nprocesses which ensure their entire permanency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     PAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  CHAPTER I.\r\n  ON THE COSMICAL ORIGIN OF THE PLANETS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.            1\r\n      Origination of Material Things—Celestial Vapours—Nebulæ—Their\r\n          vast Numbers—Sir W.

In every phenomenon of nature upon this\r\nearth—the great field from which we must glean our experiences and form\r\nour analogies—we see a constant succession of changes going on, a\r\nconstant progression from one stage of development to another taking\r\nplace, a perpetual mutation of form and nature of the same material\r\nsubstance occurring: we see the seed transformed into the plant, the\r\nflower into the fruit, and the ovum into the animal. In the inorganic\r\nworld we witness the operation of the same principle; but, by reason of\r\ntheir slower rate of progression, the changes there are manifested to us\r\nrather by their resulting effects than by their visible course of\r\noperation. And when we consider, as we are obliged to do, that the same\r\nlaws work in the greatest as well as the smallest processes of nature,\r\nwe are compelled to believe in an antecedent state of existence of the\r\nmatter that composes the host of heavenly bodies, and amongst them the\r\nearth and its attendant moon.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of this course of argument we are led to inquire whether\r\nthere exists in the universe any matter from which planetary bodies\r\ncould be formed, and how far their formation from such matter can be\r\nexplained by the operation of known material laws.\r\n\r\nBefore the telescope revealed the hidden wonders of the skies, and\r\nbrought its rich fruits into our garner of knowledge concerning the\r\nnature of the universe, the philosophic minds of some early astronomers,\r\nKepler and Tycho Brahe to wit, entertained the idea that the sun and the\r\nstars—the suns of distant systems—were formed by the condensation of\r\ncelestial vapours into spherical bodies; Kepler basing his opinion on\r\nthe phenomena of the sudden shining forth of new stars on the margin of\r\nthe Milky Way. But it was when the telescope pierced into the depths of\r\ncelestial space, and brought to light the host of those marvellous\r\nobjects, the nebulæ, that the strongest evidence was afforded of the\r\nprobable validity of these suppositions. The mention of “nebulous stars”\r\nmade by the earlier astronomers refers only to clusters of telescopic\r\nstars which the naked eye perceives as small patches of nebulous light;\r\nand it does not appear that even the nebula in Andromeda, although so\r\nplainly discernible as to be often now-a-days mistaken by the\r\nuninitiated for a comet, was known, until it was discovered by means of\r\na telescope, in 1612, by Simon Marius, who described it as resembling a\r\ncandle shining through semi-transparent horn, as in a lantern, and\r\nwithout any appearance of stars. Forty years after this date Huygens\r\ndiscovered the splendid nebula in the sword handle of Orion, and in 1665\r\nanother was detected by Hevelius. In 1667 Halley (afterwards Astronomer\r\nRoyal) discovered a fourth; a fifth was found by Kirsch in 1681, and a\r\nsixth by Halley again in 1714. Half a century after this the labours of\r\nMessier expanded the list of known nebulæ and clusters to 103, a\r\ncatalogue of which appeared in the “Connaissance du Temps” (the French\r\n“Nautical Almanac”) for the years 1783-1784. But this branch of\r\ncelestial discovery achieved its most brilliant results when the rare\r\npenetration, the indomitable perseverance, and the powerful instruments\r\nof the elder Herschel were brought to bear upon it. In the year 1779\r\nthis great astronomer began to search after nebulæ with a seven-inch\r\nreflector, which he subsequently superseded by the great one of forty\r\nfeet focus and four feet aperture. In 1786 he published his first\r\ncatalogue of 1000 nebulæ; three years later he astonished the learned\r\nworld by a second catalogue containing 1000 more, and in 1802 a third\r\ncame forth comprising other 500, making 2500 in all! This number has\r\nbeen so far increased by the labours of more recent astronomers that the\r\nlast complete catalogue, that of Sir John Herschel, published a few\r\nyears ago, contains the places of 5063 nebulæ and clusters.\r\n\r\nAt the earlier periods of Herschel’s observations, that illustrious\r\nobserver appears to have inclined to the belief that all nebulæ were but\r\nremote clusters of stars, so distant, so faint, and so thickly\r\nagglomerated as to affect the eye only by their combined luminosity, and\r\nat this period of the nebular history it was supposed that increased\r\ntelescopic power would resolve them into their component stars. But the\r\nfamiliarity which Herschel gained with the phases of the multitudinous\r\nnebulæ that passed in review before his eyes, led him ultimately to\r\nadopt the opinion, advanced by previous philosophers, that they were\r\ncomposed of some vapoury or elementary matter out of which, by the\r\nprocess of condensation, the heavenly bodies were formed; and this led\r\nhim to attempt a classification of the known nebulæ into a cosmical\r\narrangement, in which, regarding a chaotic mass of vapoury matter as the\r\nprimordial state of existence, he arranged them into a series of stages\r\nof progressive development, the individuals of one class being so nearly\r\nallied to those in the next that, to use his own expression, not so much\r\ndifference existed between them “as there would be in an annual\r\ndescription of the human figure were it given from the birth of a child\r\ntill he comes to be a man in his prime.” (_Philosophical Transactions,\r\nVol. CI., pp. 271_, _et seq._)\r\n\r\nHis category comprises upwards of thirty classes or stages of\r\nprogression, the titles of a few of which we insert here to illustrate\r\nthe completeness of his scheme.\r\n\r\n  Class  1.  Of extensive diffused nebulosity. (A table of 52\r\n             patches of such nebulosity actually observed is given,\r\n             some of which extend over an area of five or six square\r\n             degrees, and one of which occupies nine square degrees.)\r\n    ”    6.  Of milky nebulosity with condensation.\r\n    ”   15.  Of nebulæ that are of an irregular figure.\r\n    ”   17.  Of round nebulæ.\r\n    ”   20.  Of nebulæ that are gradually brighter in the middle.\r\n    ”   25.  Of nebulæ that have a nucleus.\r\n    ”   29.  Of nebulæ that draw progressively towards a period of\r\n             final condensation.\r\n    ”   30.  Of planetary nebulæ.\r\n    ”   33.  Of stellar nebulæ nearly approaching the appearance of\r\n             stars.\r\n\r\nIn a walk through a forest we see trees in every stage of growth, from\r\nthe tiny sapling to the giant of the woods, and no doubt can exist in\r\nour minds that the latter has sprung from the former. We cannot at a\r\npassing glance discern the process of development actually going on; to\r\nsatisfy ourselves of this, we must record the appearance of some single\r\ntree from time to time through a long series of years. And what a walk\r\nthrough a forest is to an observer of the growth of a tree, a lifetime\r\nis to the observer of changes in such objects as the nebulæ. The\r\ntransition from one state to another of the nebulous development is so\r\nslow that a lifetime is hardly sufficient to detect it. Nor can any\r\nprecise evidence of change be obtained by the comparison of drawings or\r\ndescriptions of nebulæ at various epochs, with whatever care or skill\r\nsuch drawings be made, for it will be admitted that no two draughtsmen\r\nwill produce each a drawing of the most simple object from the same\r\npoint of view, in which every detail in the one will coincide exactly\r\nwith every detail in the other. There is abundant evidence of this in\r\nthe existing representations of the great nebula in Orion; a comparison\r\nof the drawings that have been lately made of this object, with the most\r\nperfect instruments and by the most skilful of astronomical draughtsmen,\r\nreveals varieties of detail and even of general appearance such as could\r\nhardly be imagined to occur in similar delineations of one and the same\r\nsubject; and any one who himself makes a perfectly unbiassed drawing at\r\nthe telescope will find upon comparison of it with others that it will\r\noffer many points of difference. The fact is that the drawing of a man,\r\nlike his penmanship, is a personal characteristic, peculiar to himself,\r\nand the drawings of two persons cannot be expected to coincide any more\r\nthan their handwritings. The appearance of a nebula varies also to a\r\ngreat extent with the power of the telescope used to observe it and the\r\nconditions under which it is observed; the drawings of nebulæ made with\r\nthe inferior telescopes of a century or two centuries ago, the only ones\r\nthat, by comparison with those made in modern times, could give\r\nsatisfactory evidence of changes of form or detail, are so rude and\r\nimperfect as to be useless for the purpose, and it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that those made in the present day will be similarly useless a\r\ncentury or two hence. Since then we can obtain no evidence of the\r\nchanges we must assume these mysterious objects to be undergoing, _ipso\r\nfacto_, by observation of _one nebula_ at _various periods_, we must for\r\nthe present accept the _primâ facie_ evidence offered (as in the case of\r\nthe trees in a forest) by the observation of _various nebulæ_ at _one\r\nperiod_.\r\n\r\n“The total dissimilitude,” says Herschel at the close of the\r\nobservations we have alluded to, “between the appearance of a diffusion\r\nof the nebulous matter and of a star, is so striking, that an idea of\r\nthe conversion of the one into the other can hardly occur to any one who\r\nhas not before him the result of the critical examination of the\r\nnebulous system which has been displayed in this [his] paper. The end I\r\nhave had in view, by arranging my observations in the order in which\r\nthey have been placed, has been to show that the above mentioned\r\nextremes may be connected by such nearly allied intermediate steps, as\r\nwill make it highly probable that every succeeding state of the nebulous\r\nmatter is the result of the action of gravitation upon it while in a\r\nforegoing one, and by such steps the successive condensation of it has\r\nbeen brought up to the planetary condition. From this the transit to the\r\nstellar form, it has been shown, requires but a very small additional\r\ncompression of the nebulous matter.”\r\n\r\nWhere the researches of Herschel terminated those of Laplace commenced.\r\nHerschel showed how a mass of nebulous matter so diffused as to be\r\nscarcely discernible might be and probably was, by the mere action of\r\ngravitation, condensed into a mass of comparatively small dimensions\r\nwhen viewed in relation to the immensity of its primordial condition.\r\nLaplace demonstrated how the known laws of gravitation could and\r\nprobably did from such a partially condensed mass of matter produce an\r\nentire planetary system with all its subordinate satellites.\r\n\r\nThe first physicist who ventured to account for the formation of the\r\nvarious bodies of our solar system was Buffon, the celebrated French\r\nnaturalist. His theory, which is fully detailed in his renowned work on\r\nnatural history, supposed that at some period of remote antiquity the\r\nsun existed without any attendant planets, and that a comet having\r\ndashed obliquely against it, ploughed up and drove off a portion of its\r\nbody sufficient in bulk to form the various planets of our system. He\r\nsuggests that the matter thus carried off “at first formed a torrent the\r\ngrosser and less dense parts of which were driven the farthest, and the\r\ndensest parts, having received only the like impulsion, were not so\r\nremotely removed, the force of the sun’s attraction having retained\r\nthem:” that “the earth and planets therefore at the time of their\r\nquitting the sun were burning and in a state of liquefaction;” that “by\r\ndegrees they cooled, and in this state of fluidity they took their\r\nform.” He goes on to say that the obliquity of the stroke of the comet\r\nmight have been such as to separate from the bodies of the principal\r\nplanets small portions of matter, which would preserve the same\r\ndirection of motion as the principal planets, and thus would form their\r\nattendant satellites.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of Buffon, however, is not sufficient to explain all the\r\nphenomena of the planetary system; and it is imperfect, inasmuch as it\r\nbegins by assuming the sun to be already existing, whereas any theory\r\naccounting for the primary formation of the solar system ought\r\nnecessarily to include the origination of the most important body\r\nthereof, the sun itself. Nevertheless, it is but due to Buffon to\r\nmention his ideas, for the errors of one philosophy serve a most useful\r\nend by opening out fields of inquiry for subsequent and more fortunate\r\nspeculators.\r\n\r\nLaplace, dissatisfied with Buffon’s theory, sought one more probable,\r\nand thus was led to the proposition of the celebrated _nebular\r\nhypothesis_ which bears his name, and which, in spite of its\r\ndisbelievers, has never been overthrown, but remains the only probable,\r\nand, with our present knowledge, the only possible explanation of the\r\ncosmical origin of the planets of our system. Although Laplace puts\r\nforth his conjectures, to use his own words, “with the deference which\r\nought to inspire everything that is not a result of observation and\r\ncalculation,” yet the striking coincidence of all the planetary\r\nphenomena with the conditions of his system gives to those conjectures,\r\nagain to use his modest language, “a probability strongly approaching\r\ncertitude.”\r\n\r\nLaplace conceived the sun to have been at one period the nucleus of a\r\nvast nebula, the attenuated surrounding matter of which extended beyond\r\nwhat is now the orbit of the remotest planet of the system. He supposed\r\nthat this mass of matter in process of condensation possessed a rotatory\r\nmotion round its centre of gravity, and that the parts of it that were\r\nsituated at the limits where centrifugal force exactly counterbalanced\r\nthe attractive force of the nucleus were abandoned by the contracting\r\nmass, and thus were formed successively a number of rings of matter\r\nconcentric with and circulating around the central nucleus. As it would\r\nbe improbable that all the conditions necessary to preserve the\r\nstability of such rings of matter in their annular form could in all\r\ncases exist, they would break up into masses which would be endued with\r\na motion of rotation, and would in consequence assume a spheroidal form.\r\nThese masses, which hence constituted the various planets, in their turn\r\ncondensing, after the manner of the parent mass, and abandoning their\r\noutlying matter, would become surrounded by similarly concentric rings,\r\nwhich would break up and form the satellites surrounding the various\r\nplanetary masses; and, as a remarkable exception to the rule of the\r\ninstability of the rings and their consequent breakage, Laplace cited\r\nthe case of Saturn surrounded by his rings as the only instances of\r\nunbroken rings that the whole system offers us; unless indeed we include\r\nthe zodiacal light, that cone of hazy luminosity that is frequently seen\r\nstreaming from our luminary shortly before and after sunset, and which\r\nLaplace supposed to be formed of molecules of matter, too volatile to\r\nunite either with themselves or with the planets, and which must hence\r\ncirculate about the sun in the form of a nebulous ring, and with such an\r\nappearance as the zodiacal actually presents.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis, although it could not well be refuted, has been by many\r\nhesitatingly received, and for a reason which was at one time cogent. In\r\nthe earlier stages of nebular research it was clearly seen, as we have\r\npreviously remarked, that many of the so-called nebulæ, which appeared\r\nat first to consist of masses of vapoury matter, became, when\r\nscrutinised with telescopes of higher power, resolved into clusters\r\ncontaining countless numbers of stars, so small and so closely\r\nagglomerated, that their united lustre only impressed the more feeble\r\neye as a faint nebulosity; and as it was found that each accession of\r\ntelescopic power increased the numbers of nebulæ that were thus\r\nresolved, it was thought that every nebula would at some period succumb\r\nto the greater penetration of more powerful instruments; and if this\r\nwere the case, and if no real nebulæ were hence found to exist, how, it\r\nwas argued, could the nebular hypothesis be maintained? One of the most\r\nimportant nebulæ bearing upon this question was the great one in the\r\nsword handle of Orion, one of the grandest and most conspicuous in the\r\nwhole heavens. On account of the brightness of some portions of this\r\nobject, it seemed as though it ought to be readily resolvable, supposing\r\nall nebulæ to consist of stars, but all attempts to resolve it were in\r\nvain, even with the powerful telescopes of Sir John Herschel and the\r\nclear zenithal sky of the Cape of Good Hope. At length the question was\r\nthought to be settled, for upon the completion of Lord Rosse’s giant\r\nreflector, and upon examination of the nebula with it, his lordship\r\nstated that there could be little, if any, doubt as to its\r\nresolvability, and then it was maintained, by the disbelievers in the\r\nnebular theory, that the last stronghold of that theory had been broken\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nBut the truths of nature are for ever playing at hide and seek with\r\nthose who follow them:—the dogmas of one era are the exploded errors of\r\nthe next. Within the past few years a new science has arisen that\r\nfurnishes us with fresh powers of penetration into the vast and secret\r\nlaboratories of the universe; a new eye, so to speak, has been given us\r\nby which we may discern, by the mere light that emanates from a\r\ncelestial body, something of the chemical elements of which it is\r\ncomposed. When Newton two hundred years ago toyed with the prism he\r\nbought at Stourbridge fair, and projected its pretty rainbow tints upon\r\nthe wall, his great mind little suspected that that phantom riband of\r\ngorgeous colours would one day be called upon to give evidence upon the\r\nprobable cosmical origin of worlds. Yet such in truth has been the case.\r\nEvery substance when rendered luminous gives off light of some colour or\r\ndegree of refrangibility peculiar to itself, and although the eye cannot\r\ndetect any difference between one character of light and another, the\r\nprism gives the means of ascertaining the quality and degree of\r\nrefrangibility of the light emanating from any source however distant,\r\nand hence of gaining some knowledge of the nature of that source. If,\r\nfor instance, a ray of light from a solid body in combustion is passed\r\nthrough a prism, a spectrum is produced which exhibits light of all\r\ncolours or all degrees of refrangibility; if the light from such a body,\r\nbefore passing through the prism, be made to pass through gases or\r\ncertain metallic vapours, the resulting spectrum is found to be crossed\r\ntransversely by numbers of fine dark lines, apparently separating the\r\nvarious colours, or cutting the spectrum into bands. The solar spectrum\r\nis of this class; the once mysterious lines first observed by Wollaston,\r\nand subsequently by Fraunhoffer, and known as “Fraunhoffer’s lines,”\r\nhave now been interpreted, chiefly by the sagacious German chemist\r\nKirchoff, and identified as the effects of absorption of certain of the\r\nsun’s rays by chemical vapours contained in his atmosphere. The fixed\r\nstars yield spectra of the same character, but varying considerably in\r\nfeature, the lines crossing the stellar spectra differing in position\r\nand number from those of the sun, and one star from another, proving the\r\nstars to possess varied chemical constitutions. But there is another\r\nclass of spectra, exhibited when light from other sources is passed\r\nthrough the prism. These consist, not of a luminous riband of light like\r\nthe solar spectrum, but of bright isolated lines of coloured light with\r\ncomparatively wide dark spaces separating them. Such spectra are yielded\r\nonly by the light emitted from luminous gases and metals or chemical\r\nelements in the condition of incandescent vapour. Every gas or element\r\nin the state of luminous vapour yields a spectrum peculiar to itself,\r\nand no two elements when vapourized before the prism show the same\r\ncombinations of luminous lines.\r\n\r\nNow in the course of some observations upon the spectra of the fixed\r\nstars by Dr. Huggins, it occurred to that gentleman to turn his\r\ntelescope, armed with a spectroscope, upon some of the brighter of the\r\nnebulæ, and great was his surprise to find that instead of yielding\r\ncontinuous spectra, as they must have done had their light been made up\r\nof that of a multitude of stars, they gave spectra containing only two\r\nor three isolated bright lines; such a spectrum could only be produced\r\nby some luminous gas or vapour, and of this form of matter we are now\r\njustified in declaring, upon the strength of numerous modern\r\nobservations, these remarkable bodies are composed; and it is a curious\r\nand interesting fact that some of the nebulæ styled resolvable, from the\r\nfact of their exhibiting points of light like stars, yield these gaseous\r\nspectra, whence Dr. Huggins concludes that the brighter points taken for\r\nstars are in reality nuclei of greater condensation of the nebular\r\nmatter: and so the fact of the apparent resolvability of a nebula\r\naffords no positive proof of its non-nebulous character.\r\n\r\nThese observations—which have been fully confirmed by Father Secchi of\r\nthe Roman College—by destroying the evidence in favour of nebulæ being\r\nremote clusters, add another attestation to the probability of the truth\r\nof the nebular hypothesis, and we have now the confutation of the\r\nluminologist to add to that of the astronomers who, in the person of the\r\nillustrious Arago, asserted that the ideas of the great author of the\r\n“Mécanique Céleste” “were those only which by their grandeur, their\r\ncoherence, and their mathematical character could be truly considered as\r\nforming a physical cosmogony.”\r\n\r\nConfining, then, our attention to the single object of the universe it\r\nis our task to treat of—the Moon—and without asserting as an\r\nindisputable fact that which we can never hope to know otherwise than by\r\ninference and analogy, we may assume that that body once existed in the\r\nform of a vast mass of diffused or attenuated matter, and that, by the\r\naction of gravitation upon the particles of that matter, it was\r\ncondensed into a comparatively small and compact planetary body.\r\n\r\nBut while the process of condensation or compaction was going on,\r\nanother important law of nature—but recently unfolded to our\r\nknowledge—was in powerful operation, the discussion of which law we\r\nreserve for a separate Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                    THE GENERATION OF COSMICAL HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding Chapter we endeavoured to show how the action of\r\ngravitation upon the particles of diffused primordial matter would\r\nresult in the formation, by condensation and aggregation, of a spherical\r\nplanetary body. We have now to consider another result of the\r\ngravitating action, and for this we must call to our aid a branch of\r\nscientific enquiry and investigation unrecognized as such at the period\r\nof Laplace’s speculations, and which has been developed almost entirely\r\nwithin the past quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nThe “great philosophical doctrine of the present era of science,” as the\r\nsubject about to engage our attention has been justly termed, bears the\r\ntitle of the “Conservation of Force,” or—as some ambiguity is likely to\r\nattend the definition of the term “Force”—the “Conservation of Energy.”\r\nThe basis of the doctrine is the broad and comprehensive natural law\r\nwhich teaches us that the quantity of force comprised by the universe,\r\nlike the quantity of matter contained in it, is a fixed and invariable\r\namount, which can be neither added to nor taken from, but which is for\r\never undergoing change and transformation from one form to another. That\r\nwe cannot create force ought to be as obvious a fact as that we cannot\r\ncreate matter; and what we cannot create we cannot destroy. As in the\r\nuniverse we see no new matter created, but the same matter constantly\r\ndisappearing from one form and reappearing in another, so we can find no\r\nnew force ever coming into action—no description of force that is not to\r\nbe referred to some previous manner of existence.\r\n\r\nWithout entering upon a metaphysical discussion of the term “force,” it\r\nwill be sufficient for our purpose to consider it as something which\r\nproduces or resists motion, and hence we may argue that the ultimate\r\neffect of force is motion. The force of gravity on the earth results in\r\nthe motion or tendency of all bodies towards its centre, and, similarly,\r\nthe action of gravitation upon the atoms or particles of a primeval\r\nplanet resulted in the motion of those particles towards each other. We\r\ncannot conceive force otherwise than by its effects, or the motion it\r\nproduces.\r\n\r\nAnd force we are taught is indestructible; therefore motion must be\r\nindestructible also. But when a falling body strikes the earth, or a\r\ngunshot strikes its target, or a hammer delivers a blow upon an anvil,\r\nor a brake is pressed against a rotating wheel, motion is arrested, and\r\nit would seem natural to infer that it is destroyed. But if we say it is\r\nindestructible, what becomes of it? The philosophical answer to the\r\nquestion is this—that the motion of the mass becomes transferred to the\r\nparticles or molecules composing it, and transformed to molecular\r\nmotion, and this molecular motion manifests itself to us as heat. The\r\nparticles or atoms of matter are held together by cohesion, or, in other\r\nwords, by the action of molecular attraction. When heat is applied to\r\nthese particles, motion is set up among them, they are set in vibration,\r\nand thus, requiring and making wider room, they urge each other apart,\r\nand the well-known _expansion by heat_ is the result. If the heat be\r\nfurther continued a more violent molecular motion ensues, every increase\r\nof heat tending to urge the atoms further apart, till at length they\r\novercome their cohesive attraction and move about each other, and a\r\n_liquid or molten condition_ results. If the heat be still further\r\nincreased, the atoms break away from their cohesive fetters altogether\r\nand leap off the mass in the form of vapour, and the matter thus assumes\r\nthe _gaseous or vaporous form_. Thus we see that the phenomena of heat\r\nare phenomena of motion, and of motion only.\r\n\r\nThis mutual relation between heat and work presented itself as an embryo\r\nidea to the minds of several of the earlier philosophers, by whom it was\r\nmaintained in opposition to the _material theory_ which held heat to be\r\na kind of matter or subtle fluid stored up in the inter-atomic spaces of\r\nall bodies, capable of being separated and procured from them by rubbing\r\nthem together, but not generated thereby. Bacon, in his “Novum Organum,”\r\nsays that “heat itself, its essence and quiddity, is motion and nothing\r\nelse.” Locke defines heat as “a very brisk agitation of the insensible\r\nparts of an object, which produces in us that sensation from whence we\r\ndenominate the object hot; so what in our sensation is _heat_, in the\r\nobject is nothing but _motion_.” Descartes and his followers upheld a\r\nsimilar opinion. Richard Boyle, two hundred years ago, actually wrote a\r\ntreatise entitled “The Mechanical Theory of Heat and Cold,” and the\r\ningenious Count Rumford made some highly interesting and significant\r\nexperiments on the subject, which are described in a paper read before\r\nthe Royal Society in 1798, entitled “An Inquiry concerning the Source of\r\nHeat excited by Friction.” But the conceptions of these authors remained\r\nisolated and unfruitful for more than a century, and might have passed,\r\nmeantime, into the oblivion of barren speculation, but for the impulse\r\nwhich this branch of inquiry has lately received. Now, however, they\r\nstand forth as notable instances of truth trying to force itself into\r\nrecognition while yet men’s minds were unprepared or disinclined to\r\nreceive it. The key to the beautiful mechanical theory of heat was found\r\nby these searching minds, but the unclasping of the lock that should\r\ndisclose its beauty and value was reserved for the philosophers of the\r\npresent age.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously and independently, and without even the knowledge of each\r\nother, three men, far removed from probable intercourse, conceived the\r\nsame ideas and worked out nearly similar results concerning the\r\nmechanical theory of heat. Seeing that motion was convertible into heat,\r\nand heat into motion, it became of the utmost importance to determine\r\nthe exact relation that existed between the two elements. The first who\r\nraised the idea to philosophic clearness was Dr. Julius Robert Mayer, a\r\nphysician of Heilbronn in Germany. In certain observations connected\r\nwith his medical practice it occurred to him that there must be a\r\nnecessary equivalent between work and heat, a necessary numerical\r\nrelation between them. “The variations of the difference of colour of\r\narterial and venous blood directed his attention to the theory of\r\nrespiration. He soon saw in the respiration of animals the origin of\r\ntheir motive powers, and the comparison of animals to thermic machines\r\nafterwards suggested to him the important principle with which his name\r\nwill remain for ever connected.”\r\n\r\nNext in order of publication of his results stands the name of Colding,\r\na Danish engineer, who about the year 1843 presented a series of memoirs\r\non the steam engine to the Royal Society of Copenhagen, in which he put\r\nforth views almost identical with those of Mayer.\r\n\r\nLast in publication order, but foremost in the importance of his\r\nexperimental treatment of the subject, was our own countryman, Dr. Joule\r\nof Manchester. “Entirely independent of Mayer, with his mind firmly\r\nfixed upon a principle, and undismayed by the coolness with which his\r\nfirst labours appear to have been received, he persisted for years in\r\nhis attempts to prove the invariability of the relation which subsists\r\nbetween heat and ordinary mechanical power.” (We are quoting from\r\nProfessor Tyndall’s valuable work on “Heat considered as a Mode of\r\nMotion.”) “He placed water in a suitable vessel, agitated the water by\r\npaddles, and determined both the amount of heat developed by the\r\nstirring of the liquid and the amount of labour expended in its\r\nproduction. He did the same with mercury and sperm oil. He also caused\r\ndiscs of cast iron to rub against each other, and measured the heat\r\nproduced by their friction, and the force expended in overcoming it. He\r\nurged water through capillary tubes, and determined the amount of heat\r\ngenerated by the friction of the liquid against the sides of the tubes.\r\nAnd the results of his experiments leave no shadow of doubt upon the\r\nmind that, under all circumstances, the quantity of heat generated by\r\nthe same amount of force is fixed and invariable. A given amount of\r\nforce, in causing the iron discs to rotate against each other, produced\r\nprecisely the same amount of heat as when it was applied to agitate\r\nwater, mercury, or sperm oil. * * * * _The absolute amount of heat_\r\ngenerated by the same expenditure of power, was in all cases the same.”\r\n\r\n“In this way it was found that the quantity of heat which would raise\r\none pound of water one degree Fahrenheit in temperature, is exactly\r\nequal to what would be generated if a pound weight, after having fallen\r\nthrough a height of 772 feet, had its moving force destroyed by\r\ncollision with the earth. Conversely, the amount of heat necessary to\r\nraise a pound of water one degree in temperature, would, if all applied\r\nmechanically, be competent to raise a pound weight 772 feet high, or it\r\nwould raise 772 pounds one foot high. The term ‘foot pounds’ has been\r\nintroduced to express in a convenient way the lifting of one pound to\r\nthe height of a foot. Thus the quantity of heat necessary to raise the\r\ntemperature of a pound of water one degree Fahrenheit being taken as a\r\nstandard, 772 foot-pounds constitute what is called the _mechanical\r\nequivalent_ of heat.”\r\n\r\nBy a process entirely different, and by an independent course of\r\nreasoning, Mayer had, a few months previous to Joule, determined this\r\nequivalent to be 771·4 foot-pounds. Such a remarkable coincidence\r\narrived at by pursuing different routes gives this value a strong claim\r\nto accuracy, and raises the Mechanical Theory of Heat to the dignity of\r\nan exact science, and its enunciators to the foremost place in the ranks\r\nof physical philosophers.\r\n\r\nIn linking together the labours of the two remarkable men above alluded\r\nto, Prof. Tyndall remarks, that “Mayer’s labours have in some measure\r\nthe stamp of profound intuition, which rose however to the energy of\r\nundoubting conviction in the author’s mind. Joule’s labours, on the\r\ncontrary, are an experimental demonstration. Mayer _thought_ his theory\r\nout, and rose to its grandest applications. Joule _worked_ his theory\r\nout, and gave it the solidity of natural truth. True to the speculative\r\ninstinct of his country, Mayer drew large and mighty conclusions from\r\nslender premises; while the Englishman aimed above all things at the\r\nfirm establishment of facts.... To each belongs a reputation which will\r\nnot quickly fade, for the share he has had, not only in establishing the\r\ndynamical theory of heat, but also in leading the way towards a right\r\nappreciation of the general energies of the universe.”\r\n\r\nBut from these generalities we must pass to the application of the\r\nmechanical theory of heat to our special subject. We have learnt that\r\nevery form of motion is convertible into heat. We know that the falling\r\nmeteor or shooting star, whose motion is impeded by friction against the\r\nearth’s atmosphere, is heated thereby to a temperature of incandescence.\r\nLet us then suppose that myriads of such cosmical particles came into\r\ncollision from the effect of their mutual attraction, or that the\r\ncomponent atoms of a vast nebulous mass violently converged under the\r\nlike influence. What would follow? Obviously the generation of an\r\nintense heat by the arrest of converging motion, such a heat as would\r\nresult in the fusion of the whole into one mass. Mayer, in one of his\r\nmost remarkable papers (“Celestial Dynamics”) remarks that the\r\n“Newtonian theory of gravitation, whilst it enables us to determine,\r\nfrom its present form, the earth’s state of aggregation in ages past, at\r\nthe same time points out to us a source of heat powerful enough to\r\nproduce such a state of aggregation—powerful enough to melt worlds: it\r\nteaches us to consider the molten state of a planet as the result of the\r\nmechanical union of cosmical masses, and to derive the radiation of the\r\nsun and the heat in the bowels of the earth from a common origin.”\r\n\r\nAnd the same laws that governed the formation of the earth, governed\r\nalso the formation of the moon: the variations of Nature’s operations\r\nare _quantitative_ only and not _qualitative_. The Divine Will that made\r\nthe earth made the moon also, and the means and mode of working were the\r\nsame for both. The geological phenomena of the earth afford\r\nunmistakeable evidence of its original fluid or molten condition, and\r\nthe appearance of the moon is as unmistakeably that of a body once in an\r\nigneous or molten state. The enigma of the earth’s primary formation is\r\nsolved by the application of the dynamical theory of heat. By this\r\ntheory the generation of cosmical heat is removed from the quicksands of\r\nconjecture and established upon the firm ground of direct calculation:\r\nfor the absolute amount of heat generated by the collision of a given\r\namount of matter is (of course, with some little uncertainty) deducible\r\nfrom a mathematical formula. Mayer has computed the amount of heat that\r\nthe matter of the earth would have generated, if it had been formed\r\noriginally of only two parts drawn into collision by their mutual\r\nattraction, and has found that it would be from 0 to 32,000 or 47,000[1]\r\nCentigrade degrees, according as one part was infinitely small as\r\ncompared with the other, or as the two parts were of equal size.\r\nProfessor Helmholtz, another labourer in the same field of science, has\r\ncomputed the amount of heat generated by the condensation of the whole\r\nof the matter composing the solar system: this he finds would be\r\nequivalent to the heat that would be required to raise the temperature\r\nof a mass of water equal to the sum of the masses of all the bodies of\r\nthe system to 28,000,000 (twenty-eight million) degrees of the\r\nCentigrade scale.\r\n\r\nThese examples afford abundant evidence of sufficient heat having been\r\ngenerated by the aggregation of the matter of the moon to reduce it to a\r\nstate of fusion, and so to produce, from a nebulous chaos of diffused\r\ncosmical matter, a molten body of definite outline and size.\r\n\r\nIt is requisite here to remark that fusion does not necessarily imply\r\ncombustion. It has been frequently asked, How can a volcanic theory of\r\nthe lunar phenomena be upheld consistently with the condition that it\r\npossesses no atmosphere to support Fire? To this we would reply that to\r\nproduce a state of incandescence or a molten condition it is _not_\r\nnecessary that the body be surrounded by an atmosphere. The intensely\r\nrapid motion of the particles of matter of bodies, which the dynamical\r\ntheory shows to be the origin of the molten state, exists quite\r\nindependently of such external matter as an atmosphere. The complex\r\nmixture of gases and vapours which we term “air,” has nothing whatever\r\nto do with the fusion of substances, whatever it may have to do with\r\ntheir combustion. Combustion is a chemical phenomenon, due to the\r\ncombination of the oxygen of that air with the heated particles of the\r\ncombustible matter: oxygen is the sole supporter of combustion, and\r\nhence combustion is to be regarded rather as a phenomenon of oxygen than\r\nas a phenomenon of the matter with which that oxygen combines. The\r\ngreatest intensity of heat may exist without oxygen, and consequently\r\nwithout combustion. In support of this argument it will be sufficient to\r\nadduce, upon the authority of Dr. Tyndall, the fact that a platinum wire\r\ncan be raised to a luminous temperature and actually _fused_ in a\r\nperfect vacuum.\r\n\r\nBut while the mass of condensing cosmical matter was thus accumulating\r\nand forming the globe of the moon, the heat consequent upon the\r\naggregation of its particles was suffering some diminution from the\r\neffect of radiation. So long as the radiated heat lost fell short of the\r\ndynamical heat generated, no effect of cooling would be manifest; but\r\nwhen the _vis viva_ of the condensing matter was all converted into its\r\nequivalent of heat, or when the accession of heat fell short of that\r\nradiated, a necessary cooling must ensue, and this cooling would be\r\naccompanied by a solidification of that part of the mass which was most\r\nfree to radiate its heat into surrounding space: that part would\r\nobviously be the outer surface.\r\n\r\nWith the solidification of this external crust began the “year one” of\r\nselenological history.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena attendant upon the cooling of the mass we will consider in\r\nthe next Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n              THE SUBSEQUENT COOLING OF THE IGNEOUS BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing Chapters we have endeavoured to show, by the light of\r\nmodern science, first, how diffused cosmical matter was probably\r\ncondensed into a planetary mass by the mutual gravitation of its\r\nparticles, and secondly, how, the after destruction of the gravitative\r\nforce, by the collision of the converging particles of matter, resulted\r\nin the generation of such sufficient heat as to reduce the whole mass to\r\na molten condition. Our present task is to consider the subsequent\r\ncooling of the mass, and the phenomena attendant upon or resulting\r\ntherefrom. This brief Chapter is important to our subject, as we shall\r\nhave frequent occasion to refer to the leading principle we shall\r\nendeavour to illustrate in it, in subsequently treating of the causes to\r\nwhich the special selenological features are to be attributed.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as regards the cooling of the igneous mass that constituted\r\nthe moon at the inconceivably remote period when possibly that body was\r\nreally a “lesser light” shining with a luminosity of its own, due to its\r\nthen incandescent state, and not simply a reflector, as it is now, of\r\nlight which it receives from the sun. If we could conceive it possible\r\nthat the igneous mass in the act of cooling parted with its heat from\r\nthe central part first and so began to solidify from its centre, or if\r\nit had been possible for the mass to have cooled uniformly and\r\nsimultaneously throughout its whole depth, or that each substratum had\r\ncooled before its superstratum, we should have had a moon whose surface\r\nwould have been smooth and without any such remarkable asperities and\r\nexcresences as are now presented to our view. But these suppositions are\r\ninadmissible: on the contrary we are compelled to consider that the\r\nportion of the igneous or molten body that first cooled was its exterior\r\nsurface, which, radiating its heat into surrounding space, became solid\r\nand comparatively cool while the interior retained its hot and molten\r\ncondition. So that at this early stage of the moon’s history it existed\r\nin the form of a solid shell inclosing a molten interior.\r\n\r\nNow at this period of its formation, the moon’s mass, partly cooled and\r\nsolidified and partly molten, would be subject to the influence of two\r\npowerful molecular forces: the first of these would consist in the\r\ndiminution of bulk or contraction of volume which accompanies the\r\ncooling of solidified masses of previously molten substances; the second\r\nwould arise from a phenomenon which we may here observe is by no means\r\nso generally known as from its importance it deserves to be: and as we\r\nshall have frequent occasion to refer to it as one of the chief agencies\r\nin producing the peculiar structural characteristics of the moon’s\r\nsurface, it may be well here to give a few examples of its action, that\r\nour reference to it hereafter may be more clearly understood.\r\n\r\nThe broad general principle of the phenomenon here referred to is\r\nthis:—that fusible substances are (with a few exceptions) specifically\r\nheavier while in their molten condition than in the solidified state, or\r\nin other words, that molten matter occupies less space, weight for\r\nweight, than the same matter after it has passed from the melted to the\r\nsolid condition. It follows as an obvious corollary that such substances\r\ncontract in bulk in fusing or melting, and expand in becoming solid. It\r\nis this expansion upon solidification that now concerns us.\r\n\r\nWater, as is well known, increases in density as it cools, till it\r\nreaches the temperature of 39° Fahrenheit, after which, upon a further\r\ndecrease of temperature, its density begins to decrease, or in other\r\nwords its bulk expands, and hence the well-known fact of ice floating in\r\nwater, and the inconvenient fact of water-pipes bursting in a frost.\r\nThis action in water is of the utmost importance in the grand economy of\r\nnature, and it has been accepted as a marvellous exception to the\r\ngeneral law of substances increasing in density (or shrinking) as they\r\ndecrease in temperature. Water is, however, by no means the exceptional\r\nsubstance that it has been so generally considered. It is a fact\r\nperfectly familiar to iron-founders, that when a mass of solid cast-iron\r\nis dropped into a pot of molten iron of identical quality, the solid is\r\nfound to float persistently upon the molten metal—so persistently that\r\nwhen it is intentionally thrust to the bottom of the pot, it rises again\r\nthe moment the submerging agency is withdrawn. As regards the amount of\r\nbuoyancy we believe it may be stated in round numbers to be at least two\r\nor three per cent. It has been suggested by some who are familiar with\r\nthis phenomenon that the solid mass may be kept up by a spurious\r\nbuoyancy imparted to it by a film of adhering air, or that surface\r\nimpurities upon the solid metal may tend to reduce the specific gravity\r\nof the mass and thereby prevent it sinking, and that the fact of\r\nfloatation is not absolutely a proof of greater specific lightness. But\r\nin controversion of these suggestions, we can state as the result of\r\nexperiment that pieces of cast-iron which have had their surface\r\nroughness entirely removed, leaving the bright metal exposed, still\r\nfloat on the molten metal, and further that when, under the influence of\r\nthe great heat of the molten mass, the solid is gradually melted away,\r\nand consequently any possible surface impurities or adhering air must\r\nnecessarily have been removed, the remaining portion continues to float\r\nto the last. The inevitable inference from this is that in the case of\r\ncast-iron the solid is specifically lighter than the molten, and,\r\ntherefore, that in passing from the molten to the solid condition this\r\nsubstance undergoes expansion in bulk.\r\n\r\nWe are able to offer a confirmation of this inference in the case of\r\ncast-iron by a remarkable phenomenon well known to iron-founders, but of\r\nwhich we have never met with special notice. When a ladle or pot of\r\nmolten iron is drawn from the melting furnace and allowed to stand at\r\nrest, the surface presents a most remarkable and suggestive appearance.\r\nInstead of remaining calm and smooth it is the scene of a lively\r\ncommotion: the thin coat of scoria or molten oxide which forms on the\r\notherwise bright surface of the metal is seen, as fast as it forms at\r\nthe circumference of the pot, to be swept by active convergent currents\r\ntowards the centre, where it accumulates in a patch. While this action\r\nis proceeding, the entire upper surface of the metal appears as if it\r\nwere covered with animated vermicules of scoria, springing into\r\nexistence at the circumference of the pot, and from thence rapidly\r\nstreaming and wriggling themselves towards the centre.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nOur illustration (Fig. 1) is intended, so far as such means can do so,\r\nto convey some idea of this remarkable appearance at one instant of its\r\ncontinued occurrence. To interpret our illustration rightly it is\r\nnecessary to imagine this vermicular freckling to be constantly and\r\nrapidly streaming from all points of the periphery of the pot towards\r\nthe centre, where, as we have said, it accumulates in the form of a\r\nfloating island. We may observe that the motion is most rapid when the\r\nhot metal is first put into the cool ladle: as the fluid metal parts\r\nwith some of its heat and the ladle gets hot by absorbing it, this\r\nremarkable surface disturbance becomes less energetic.\r\n\r\nNow if we carefully consider this peculiar action and seek a cause for\r\nthe phenomenon, we shall be led to the conclusion that it arises from\r\nthe expansion of that portion of the molten mass which is in contact\r\nwith or close proximity to the comparatively cool sides of the ladle,\r\nwhich sides act as the chief agent in dispersing the heat of the melted\r\nmetal. The motion of the scoria betrays that of the fluid metal beneath,\r\nand careful observation will show that the motion in question is the\r\nresult of an upward current of the metal around the circumference of the\r\nladle, as indicated by the arrows A, B, C in the accompanying sectional\r\ndrawing of the ladle (Fig. 2). The upward current of the metal can\r\nactually be seen when specially looked for, at the rim of the pot, where\r\nit is deflected into the convergent horizontal direction and where it\r\npresents an elevatory appearance as shown in the figure. It is difficult\r\nto assign to this effect any other cause than that of an expansion and\r\nconsequent reduction of the specific gravity of the fluid metal in\r\ncontact with or in close proximity to the cooler sides of the pot, as,\r\naccording to the generally entertained idea that contraction universally\r\naccompanies cooling, it would be impossible for the cooler to float on\r\nthe hotter metal, and the curious surface-currents above referred to\r\nwould be in contrary direction to that which they invariably take,\r\n_i.e._, they would diverge from the centre instead of converging to it.\r\nThe external arrows in the figure represent the radiation of the heat\r\nfrom the outer sides of the pot, which is the chief cause of cooling.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nTurning from cast-iron to other metals we find further manifestations of\r\nthis expansive solidification. Bismuth is a notable example. In his\r\nlectures on Heat, Dr. Tyndall exhibited an experiment in which a stout\r\niron bottle was filled with molten bismuth, and the stopper tightly\r\nclosed. The whole was set aside to cool, and as the metal within\r\napproached consolidation the bottle was rent open by its expansion, just\r\nas would have been the case had the bottle been filled with water and\r\nexposed to freezing temperature. Mercury affords another example.\r\nThermometers which have to be exposed to Arctic temperatures are\r\ngenerally filled with spirit instead of quicksilver, because the latter\r\nhas been found to burst the bulbs when the cold reached the congealing\r\npoint of the metal, the bursting being a consequence of the expansion\r\nwhich accompanies the act of congelation. Silver also expands in passing\r\nfrom the fluid to the solid state, for we are informed by a practical\r\nrefiner that solid floats on molten silver as ice floats on water; it\r\nalso, as likewise do gold and copper, exhibits surface converging\r\ncurrents in the melting-pot like those depicted above for molten iron.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be objected that metals are too distantly related to\r\nvolcanic substances to justify inferences being drawn from their\r\nbehaviour in explanation of volcanic phenomena. With a view therefore of\r\ntesting the question at issue with a substance admitted as closely\r\nallied to volcanic material, we appealed to the furnace slag of\r\niron-works. The following are extracts from the letters of an iron\r\nmanufacturer of great experience[2] to whom we referred the question:—\r\n\r\n“I beg to inform you that cold slag floats in molten slag in the same\r\nway cold iron floats in molten iron.\r\n\r\n“I filled a box with hot molten slag run quickly from a blast furnace;\r\nthe box was about 5½ feet square by 2 feet deep, and I dropped into the\r\nslag a piece of cold slag weighing 16 lbs., when it came to the top in a\r\nsecond. I pushed it down to the bottom several times and it always made\r\nits appearance at the top: indeed a small portion of it remained above\r\nthe molten slag.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nHere then we have a substance closely allied to volcanic material which\r\nmanifests the expansile principle in question; but we may go still\r\nfurther and give evidence from the very fountain-head by instancing what\r\nappears to be a most cogent example of its operation which we observed\r\non the occasion of a visit to the crater of Vesuvius in 1865 while a\r\nmodified eruption was in progress. On this occasion we observed\r\nwhite-hot lava streaming down from apertures in the sides of a central\r\ncone within the crater and forming a lake of molten lava on the plateau\r\nor bottom of the crater; on the surface of this molten lake vast cakes\r\nof the same lava which had become solidified were floating, exactly in\r\nthe same manner as ice floats in water. The solidified lava had cracked,\r\nand divided into cakes, in consequence of its contraction and also of\r\nthe uprising of the accumulating fluid lava on which it floated, more\r\nand more space being thus afforded for it to separate, on account of the\r\ncrater widening upwards, while through the joints or fissures the fluid\r\nlava could be seen beneath. But for the decrease in density and\r\nconsequent expansion in volume which accompanied solidification, this\r\nfloating of the solidified lava on the molten could not have occurred.\r\nReference to Fig. 3, which represents a section of the crater of\r\nVesuvius on the occasion above referred to, will perhaps assist the\r\nreader to a more clear idea of what we have endeavoured to describe. A A\r\nare the streams of white-hot lava issuing from openings in the sides of\r\nthe central cone, and accumulating beneath the solidified crust B B in a\r\nlake of molten lava at C C; the solidified crust B B as it was floated\r\nupwards dividing into separate cakes as represented in Fig. 4. (See also\r\nPlate I.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n    CRATER OF VESUVIUS.\r\n    1865.]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what would be the effect produced upon a spherical\r\nmass of molten matter in progress of cooling, first under the action of\r\nthe above described expansion which precedes solidification, and then by\r\nthe contraction which accompanies the cooling of a solidified body. The\r\nfirst portion of such a mass to part with its heat being its external\r\nsurface, this portion would expand, but there being no obstacle to\r\nresist the expansion there would be no other result than a temporary\r\nslight enlargement of the sphere. This external portion would on cooling\r\nform a solid shell encompassing a more or less fluid molten nucleus, but\r\nas this interior has in its turn, on approaching the point of\r\nsolidification, to expand also, and there being, so to speak, no room\r\nfor its expansion, by reason of its confinement within its solid casing,\r\nwhat would be the consequence?—the shell would be rent or burst open,\r\nand a portion of the molten interior ejected with more or less violence\r\naccording to circumstances, and many of the characteristic features of\r\nvolcanic action would be thus produced: the thickness of the outer\r\nshell, the size of the vent made by the expanding matter for its escape,\r\nand other conditions conspiring to modify the nature and extent of the\r\neruption. Thus there would result vast floodings of the exterior surface\r\nof the shell by the so extruded molten matter, volcanoes, extruded\r\nmountains, and other manifestations of eruptive phenomena. The sectional\r\ndiagram (Fig. 5) will help to convey a clear idea of this action. Basing\r\nour reasoning on the principle we have thus enunciated, namely, that\r\nmolten telluric matter expands on nearing the point of solidification,\r\nand which we have endeavoured to illustrate by reference to actual\r\nexamples of its operation, we consider we are justified in assuming that\r\nsuch a course of volcanic phenomena has very probably occurred again and\r\nagain upon the moon; that this expansion of volume which accompanies the\r\nsolidification of molten matter furnishes a key to the solution of the\r\nenigma of volcanic action; and that such theories as depend upon the\r\nagency of gases, vapour, or water are at all events untenable with\r\nregard to the moon, where no gases, vapour, or water, appear to exist.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 5. A A. The solidified crust cooling,\r\n    contracting, and cracking; the cracking action enhanced by the\r\n    expansion of the substratum of molten matter, B B B, which,\r\n    expanding as it approaches the point of solidification, injects\r\n    portions of the molten matter up through the contractile cracks, and\r\n    results in producing craters, mountains of exudation, and districts\r\n    flooded with extruded lava, C C C. The nucleus of intensely hot\r\n    molten matter.]\r\n\r\nThat an upheaving and ejective force has been in action with varying\r\nintensity beneath the whole of the lunar surface is manifest from the\r\naspect of its structural details, and we are impressed with the\r\nconviction that the principle we have set forth, namely the paroxysms of\r\nexpansion which successively occurred as portions of its molten interior\r\napproached solidification, supply us with a rational cause to which such\r\nvast ejective and upheaving phenomena may be assigned. Many features of\r\nterrestrial geology likewise require such an expansive force whereby to\r\nexplain them; we therefore venture to recommend this source and cause of\r\nejective action to the careful consideration of geologists.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nWhen the molten substratum had burst its confines, ejected its\r\nsuperfluous matter, and produced the resulting volcanic features, it\r\nwould, after final solidification, resume the normal process of\r\ncontraction upon cooling, and so retreat or shrink away from the\r\nexternal shell. Let us now consider what would be the result of this.\r\nEvidently the external shell or crust would become relatively too large\r\nto remain at all points in close contact with the subjacent matter. The\r\nconsequence of too large a solid shell having to accommodate itself to a\r\nshrunken body underneath, is that the skin, so to term the outer stratum\r\nof solid matter, becomes shrivelled up into alternate ridges and\r\ndepressions, or wrinkles. In its attempt to crush down and follow the\r\ncontracting substratum, it would have to displace the superabundant or\r\nsuperfluous material of its former larger surface by thrusting it (by\r\nthe action of tangential force) into undulating ridges as in Fig. 6, or\r\nbroken elevated ridges as in Fig. 7, or overlappings of the outer crust\r\nas in Fig. 8, or ridges capped by more or less fluid molten matter\r\nextruded from beneath, as indicated in Fig. 9, a class of action which\r\nmight occur contemporaneously with the elevation of the ridge or\r\nsubsequently to its formation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nA long-kept shrivelled apple affords an apt illustration of this wrinkle\r\ntheory; another example may be observed in the human face and hand, when\r\nage has caused the flesh to shrink and so leave the comparatively\r\nunshrinking skin relatively too large as a covering for it. We\r\nillustrate both of these examples by actual photographs of the\r\nrespective objects, which are reproduced on Plate II. Whenever an outer\r\ncovering has to accommodate and apply itself to an interior body that\r\nhas become too small for it, wrinkles are inevitably produced. The same\r\naction that shrivels the human skin into creases and wrinkles, has also\r\nshrivelled certain regions of the igneous crust of the earth. A map of a\r\nmountainous part of our globe affords abundant evidence of such a cause\r\nhaving been in action; such maps are pictures of wrinkles. Several parts\r\nof the lunar surface, as we shall by-and-by see, present us with the\r\nsame appearances in a modified degree.\r\n\r\nTo the few primary causes we have set forth in this chapter—to the\r\nalternate expansion and contraction of successive strata of the lunar\r\nsphere, when in a state of transition from an igneous and molten to a\r\ncooled and solidified condition, we believe we shall be able to refer\r\nwell nigh all the remarkable and characteristic features of the lunar\r\nsurface which will come under our notice in the course of our survey.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n    BACK of HAND & SHRIVELLED APPLE.\r\n    TO ILLUSTRATE the ORIGIN of CERTAIN MOUNTAIN RANGES BY SHRINKAGE of\r\n    the GLOBE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n      THE FORM, MAGNITUDE, WEIGHT, AND DENSITY OF THE LUNAR GLOBE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not hitherto had occasion to refer to what we may term the\r\nphysical elements of the moon: by which we mean the various data\r\nconcerning form, size, weight, density, &c. of that body, derived from\r\nobservation and calculation. To this purpose, therefore, we will now\r\ndevote a few pages, confining ourselves to such matters as specially\r\nbear upon the requirements of our subject, omitting such as are\r\nirrelevant to our purpose, and touching but lightly upon such as are\r\ncommonly known, or are explained in ordinary elementary treatises on\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as regards the form of the moon. The form of the lunar\r\ndisc, when fully illuminated, we perceive to be a perfect circle; that\r\nis to say, the measured diameters in all directions are equal; and we\r\nare therefore led to infer that the real form of the moon is that of a\r\nperfect sphere. We know that the earth and the rest of the planets of\r\nour system are spheroidal, or more or less flattened at the poles, and\r\nwe also know that this flattening is a consequence of axial rotation;\r\nthe extent of the flattening, or the oblateness of the spheroid,\r\ndepending upon the speed of that rotation. But in the case of the moon\r\nthe axial rotation is so slow that the flattening produced thereby,\r\nalthough it must exist, is so slight as to be imperceptible to our\r\nobservation. We might therefore conclude that the moon is a perfectly\r\nspherical body, did not theory step in to show us that there is another\r\ncause by which its form is disturbed. Assuming the moon to have been\r\nonce in a fluid state, it is demonstrable that the attraction of the\r\nearth would accumulate a mass of matter, like a tidal elevation, in the\r\ndirection of a line joining the centres of the two bodies: and as a\r\nconsequence, the real shape of the moon must be an ellipsoid, or\r\nsomewhat egg-shaped body, the major axis of which is directed towards\r\nthe earth. That some such phenomenon has obtained is evident from the\r\ncoincidence of the times of orbital revolution and axial rotation of the\r\nlunar sphere. “It would be against all probability,” says Laplace, “to\r\nsuppose that these two motions had been at their origin perfectly\r\nequal;” but it is sufficient that their primitive difference was but\r\nsmall, in which case the constant attraction by the earth of the\r\nprotuberant part of the moon would establish the equality which at\r\npresent exists.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, sufficient for all purposes with which we are concerned\r\nto regard the moon as a sphere, and the next point to be considered is\r\nits size. To determine this, two data are necessary—its apparent or\r\nangular diameter, and its distance from the earth. The first of these is\r\nobtained by measuring the angle comprised between two lines directed\r\nfrom the eye to two opposite “limbs” or edges of the moon. If, for\r\ninstance, we were to take a pair of compasses and, placing the joint at\r\nthe eye, open out the legs till the two points appear to touch two\r\nopposite edges of the moon, the two legs would be inclined at an angle\r\nwhich would represent the diameter of the moon, and this angle we could\r\nmeasure by applying a divided arc or protractor to the compasses. In\r\npractice this measurement is made by means of telescopes attached to\r\naccurately divided circles; the difference between the readings of the\r\ncircle when the telescope is directed to opposite limbs of the moon\r\ngiving its angular diameter at the time of the observation. But from the\r\nfact that the orbit of the moon is an ellipse, it is evident that she is\r\nat some times much nearer to us than at others, and, as a consequence,\r\nher apparent magnitude is variable: there is also a slight variation\r\ndepending upon the altitude of the moon at the time of the measure; the\r\nmean diameter, however, or the diameter at mean distance from the centre\r\nof the earth has, from long course of observation, been found to be 31′\r\n9″.\r\n\r\nTo convert this apparent angular diameter into real linear measurement,\r\nit is necessary to know either the distance of the moon from the earth,\r\nor in astronomical language as leading to a knowledge of that distance,\r\nwhat is the amount of the moon’s parallax. Parallax, generally, is an\r\napparent change of position of an object arising from change of the\r\npoint of view. The parallax of a heavenly body is the angle which the\r\nearth would subtend if it were seen from that body. Supposing an\r\nobserver on the moon could measure the earth’s angular diameter, just as\r\nwe measure that of the moon, his measurement would represent what is\r\ncalled the parallax of the moon. But we cannot go to the moon to make\r\nsuch a measurement; nevertheless there is a simple method, explained in\r\nmost treatises on astronomy, which consists in observing the moon from\r\nstations on the earth widely separated, and by which we can obtain a\r\nprecisely similar result. Without detailing the process, it is\r\nsufficient for us to know that the angle which would be subtended by the\r\nearth if seen from the moon, or the moon’s parallax, is according to the\r\nlatest determination, equal to 1° 54′ 5″. This value, however, varies\r\nconsiderably with the variations of distance due to the elliptic orbit\r\nof the moon: the number we have given represents the mean parallax, or\r\nthe parallax at mean distance.\r\n\r\nBut we have to turn these angular measurements into miles. To effect\r\nthis we have only to work a simple rule of three sum. It will easily be\r\nunderstood that, as the angular diameter of the earth seen from the moon\r\nis to the angular diameter of the moon seen from the earth, so is the\r\ndiameter of the earth in miles to the diameter of the moon in miles. The\r\ndiameter of the earth we know to be 7912 miles: putting this therefore\r\nin its proper place in the proportion sum, and duly working it out by\r\nthe schoolboy’s rule, we get:—\r\n\r\n           1°. 54′. 5″ : 31′. 9″ :: 7912 miles. : 2160 miles.\r\n\r\nAnd 2160 miles is therefore the diameter of the lunar globe.\r\n\r\nKnowing the diameter, we can easily obtain the other elements of\r\nmagnitude. According to the well-known relation of the diameter of a\r\nsphere to its area, we find the area of the moon to be 14,657,000 square\r\nmiles: or half that number, 7,328,500 miles, as the area of the\r\nhemisphere at any one time presented to our view. And similarly, from\r\nthe relation of the solidity of a sphere to its diameter, we find the\r\nsolid contents of the moon to be 5276 millions of cubic miles of matter.\r\n\r\nComparing these data with corresponding dimensions of the earth, we find\r\nthat the diameter of the moon is 1/3·665; the area 1/13·4245; and the\r\nvolume 1/49·1865, of the respective elements of the earth. Those who\r\nprefer a graphical to a numerical comparison, may judge of the sizes of\r\nthe two bodies by the accompanying illustration (Fig. 10). To gain an\r\nidea of their distance from each other it is necessary to suppose the\r\ntwo discs in the diagram to be 30 inches apart; the real distance of the\r\nmoon from the earth being about 238,790 miles at its mean position.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nNext, we come to what is technically termed the _mass_, but what in\r\ncommon language we may call the _weight_ of the moon. It is important to\r\nknow this, because the weight of a body taken in connection with its\r\nsize furnishes us with a knowledge of its density, or the specific\r\ngravity of the material of which it is composed. But it is not quite so\r\neasy to determine the mass as the dimensions of the moon: to _measure_\r\nit, we have seen is easy enough; to _weigh_ it is a comparatively\r\ndifficult matter. To solve the problem we have to appeal to Newton’s law\r\nof universal gravitation. This law teaches us that every particle of\r\nmatter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force which\r\nis _directly proportional to the mass_, and inversely proportional to\r\nthe distance of the attracting particles. There are several methods by\r\nwhich this law is applied to the measurement of the mass of the moon.\r\nOne of the simplest is by the agency of the Tides. We know that the\r\nmoon, attracting the waters, produces a certain amount of elevation of\r\nthe aqueous covering of the earth; and we know that the sun produces\r\nalso a like elevation, but to a much smaller extent, by reason of its\r\nmuch greater distance. Now measuring accurately the heights of the solar\r\nand lunar tides, and making allowance for the difference of distance of\r\nthe sun and moon from the earth, we can compare directly the effect that\r\nis due to the sun with the effect that is due to the moon: and since the\r\nmasses of the two bodies are just in proportion to the effects they\r\nproduce, it is evident that we have a comparison between the mass of the\r\nsun and that of the moon; and knowing what is the sun’s mass we can, by\r\nsimple proportion, find that of the moon. Another method is as\r\nfollows:—The moon is retained in her orbital path by the attraction of\r\nthe earth; if it were not for this attraction she would fly off from her\r\ncourse in a tangential line. She has thus a constant tendency to quit\r\nher orbit, which the earth’s attraction as constantly overcomes. It is\r\nevident from this that the earth pulls the moon towards itself by a\r\ndefinite amount in every second of time. But while the earth is pulling\r\nthe moon, the moon is also pulling the earth: they are pulling each\r\nother together; and moreover each is exerting a pull which is\r\n_proportional to its mass_. Knowing, then, the mass of the earth, which\r\nwe do with considerable accuracy, we can find what share of the whole\r\npulling force is due to it, the residue being the moon’s share: the\r\nproportion which this residue bears to the earth’s share gives us the\r\nproportion of the moon’s mass to that of the earth, and hence the mass\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\nThere are yet two other methods: one depending upon the phenomena of\r\nnutation, or the attraction of the sun and moon upon the protruberant\r\nmatter of the terrestrial spheroid; and the other upon a displacement of\r\nthe centre of gravity of the earth and moon, which shows itself in\r\nobservations of the sun. By each and all of these methods has the lunar\r\nmass been at various times determined, and it has been found, as the\r\nlatest and best accepted value, that the mass of the moon is\r\n_one-eightieth_ that of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the known diameter of the earth we ascertain that its volume is\r\n259,360 millions of cubic miles: and from the various experiments that\r\nhave been made to determine the mean density of the earth, it has been\r\nfound that that mean density is about 5½ times that of water; that is to\r\nsay, the earth weighs 5½ times heavier than would a sphere of water of\r\nequal size. Now a cubic foot of water weighs 62·3211 pounds, and from\r\nthis we can find by simple multiplication what is the weight of a cubic\r\nmile of water, and, similarly, what would be the weight of 259,360 cubic\r\nmiles of water, and the last result multiplied by 5½ will give the\r\nweight of the earth in tons: The calculation, although extremely simple,\r\ninvolves a confusing heap of figures; but the result, which is all that\r\nconcerns us, is, that the weight of the earth is 5842 trillions of tons:\r\nand since, as we have above stated, the mass of the earth is 80 times\r\nthat of the moon, it follows that the weight of the moon is 73 trillions\r\nof tons.\r\n\r\nThe cubical contents of a body compared with its weight gives us its\r\ndensity. In the moon we have 5276 millions of cubic miles of matter, the\r\ntotal weight of which is 73 trillions of tons. Now, 5276 millions of\r\ncubic miles of water would weigh about 21½ trillions of tons; and as\r\nthis number is to 73 as 1 is to 3·4, it is clear that the density of the\r\nlunar matter is 3·4 greater than water: and inasmuch as the earth is 5½\r\ntimes denser than water, we see that the moon is about 0·62 as dense as\r\nthe earth, or that the material of the moon is lighter, bulk for bulk,\r\nthan the mean material of the terraqueous globe in the proportion of 62\r\nto 100, or, nearly, 6 to 10. This specific gravity of the lunar material\r\n(3·4) we may remark is about the same as that of flint glass or the\r\ndiamond: and curiously enough it nearly coincides with that of some of\r\nthe aërolites that have from time to time fallen to the earth; hence\r\nsupport has been claimed for the theory that these bodies were\r\noriginally fragments of lunar matter, probably ejected at some time from\r\nthe lunar volcanoes with such force as to propel them so far within the\r\nsphere of the earth’s attraction that they have ultimately been drawn to\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\nReverting, now, to the mass of the moon: we must bear in mind that the\r\nmass or weight of a planetary body determines the weight of all objects\r\non its surface. What we call a pound on the earth, would not be a pound\r\non the moon; for the following reason:—When we say that such and such an\r\nobject weighs so much, we really mean that it is attracted towards the\r\nearth with a certain force depending upon its own weight. This\r\nattraction we call gravity; and the falling of a weight to the earth is\r\nan example of the action of the law of universal gravitation. The earth\r\nand the weight fall together—or are held together if the weight is in\r\ncontact with the earth—with a force which depends directly upon the mass\r\nof the two, and upon the distance between them. Newton proved that the\r\nattraction of a sphere upon external objects is precisely as if the\r\nwhole of its matter were contained at its centre. So that the attractive\r\nforce of the earth upon a ton weight at its surface, is the attraction\r\nwhich 5842 trillions of tons exert upon one ton situated 3956 miles (the\r\nradius of the earth) distant. If the weight of the earth were only half\r\nthe above quantity, it is clear that the attraction would be only half\r\nwhat it is; and hence the ton weight, being pulled by only half the\r\nforce, would only be equal to half a ton; that is to say, only half as\r\nmuch muscular force (or any other force but gravity) would be required\r\nto lift it. It is plain, therefore, that what weighs a pound on the\r\nearth could not weigh a pound on the moon, which is only 1/80 of the\r\nweight of the earth. What, then, is the relation between a pound on the\r\nearth and the same mass of matter on the moon? It would seem, since the\r\nmoon’s mass is 1/80 of the earth, that the pound transported to the moon\r\nought to weigh the eightieth part of a pound there; and so it would if\r\nthe distance from the centre of the moon to its surface were the same as\r\nthe distance of the centre of the earth from its surface. But the radius\r\nof the moon is only 1/3·665 that of the earth; and the force of gravity\r\nvaries _inversely as the square of the distance_ between the centres of\r\nthe gravitating masses. So that the attraction by the moon of a body at\r\nits surface, as compared with that of the earth, is 1/80 multiplied by\r\nthe square of 1/3·665; and this, worked out, is equal to 1/6. The force\r\nof gravity upon the moon is, therefore, 1/6 of that on the earth; and\r\nhence a pound upon the earth would be little more than 2½ ounces on the\r\nmoon; and it follows as a consequence that any force, such as muscular\r\nexertion, or the energy of chemical, plutonic or explosive forces, would\r\nbe six times more effective upon the moon than upon the earth. A man who\r\ncould jump six feet from the earth, could with the same muscular effort\r\njump thirty-six feet from the moon; the explosive energy that would\r\nproject a body a mile above the earth would project a like body six\r\nmiles above the surface of the moon.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice, in elementary and popular treatises on astronomy, to\r\nstate merely the numerical results in giving data such as those embodied\r\nin the foregoing pages; and uninitiated readers, not knowing the means\r\nby which the figures are arrived at, are sometimes disposed to regard\r\nthem with a certain amount of doubt or uncertainty. On this account we\r\nhave thought it advisable to give, in as brief and concise a form as\r\npossible, the various steps by which these seemingly unattainable\r\nresults are obtained.\r\n\r\nThe data explained in the foregoing text are here collected to\r\nfacilitate reference.\r\n\r\n  Diameter of Moon 2160 miles                   1/3·665 that of earth.\r\n  Area             14,657,000 square miles      1/13·424    ”    ”\r\n  Area of the      7,328,500 square miles\r\n  visible\r\n  hemisphere\r\n  Solid contents   5276 millions of cubic miles 1/49·186    ”    ”\r\n  Mass             73 trillions of tons         1/80    ”    ”\r\n  Density          3·39 (water = 1)             0·62    ”    ”\r\n  Force of                                      1/6    ”    ”\r\n  gravity at\r\n  surface\r\n  Mean distance    238,790 miles.\r\n  from earth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n        ON THE EXISTENCE OR NON-EXISTENCE OF A LUNAR ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the preceding chapter we stated that any force acting in\r\nopposition to that of gravity would be six times more effective on the\r\nmoon than on the earth. But, in fact, it would in many cases be still\r\nmore so; at all events, so far as projectile forces are concerned; for\r\nthe reason that “the powerful coercer of projectile range,” as the\r\nearth’s atmosphere has been termed, has no counterpart, or at most a\r\nvery disproportionate one, upon the moon.\r\n\r\nThe existence of an atmosphere surrounding the moon has been the subject\r\nof considerable controversy, and a great deal of evidence on both sides\r\nof the question has been offered from time to time, and is to be found\r\nscattered through the records of various classes of observations. Some\r\nof the more important items of this evidence it is our purpose to set\r\nforth in the course of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nWith the phenomena of the terrestrial atmosphere, with the effects that\r\nare attributable to it, we are all well familiar, and our best course\r\ntherefore is to examine, as far as we are able, whether counterparts of\r\nany of these effects are manifested upon the moon. For instance, the\r\nclouds that are generated in and float through our air would, to an\r\nobserver on the moon, appear as ever changing bright or dusky spots,\r\nobliterating certain of the permanent details of the earth’s surface,\r\nand probably skirting the terrestrial disc, like the changing belts we\r\nperceive on the planet Jupiter, or diversifying its features with less\r\nregularity, after the manner exhibited by the planet Mars. If such\r\nclouds existed on the moon it is evident that the details of its surface\r\nmust be, from time to time, similarly obscured; but no trace of such\r\nobscuration has ever been detected. When the moon is observed with high\r\ntelescopic powers, all its details come out sharp and clear, without the\r\nleast appearance of change or the slightest symptoms of cloudiness other\r\nthan the occasional want of general definition, which may be proved to\r\nbe the result of unsteadiness or want of homogeneity in our own\r\natmosphere; for we must tell the uninitiated that nights of pure, good\r\ndefinition, such as give the astronomer opportunity of examining with\r\nhigh powers the minute details of planetary features, are very few and\r\nfar between. Out of the three hundred and sixty-five nights of a year\r\nthere are probably not a dozen that an astronomer can call really fine:\r\nusually, even on nights that are to all common appearance superbly\r\nbrilliant, some strata of air of different densities or temperatures, or\r\nin rapid motion, intervene between the observer and the object of his\r\nobservation, and through these, owing to the ever-changing refractions\r\nwhich the rays of light coming from the object suffer in their course,\r\nobservation of the delicate markings of a planet is impossible: all is\r\nblurred and confused, and nothing but bolder features can be recognized.\r\nIt has in consequence sometimes happened that a slight indistinctness of\r\nsome minute detail of the moon has been attributed to clouds or mists at\r\nthe lunar surface, whereas the real cause has been only a bad condition\r\nof our own atmosphere. It may be confidently asserted that when all\r\nindistinctness due to terrestrial causes is taken account of or\r\neliminated, there remain no traces whatever of any clouds or mists upon\r\nthe surface of the moon.\r\n\r\nThis is but one proof against the existence of a lunar atmosphere, and,\r\nit may be argued, not a very conclusive one; because there may still be\r\nan atmosphere, though it be not sufficiently aqueous to condense into\r\nclouds and not sufficiently dense to obscure the lunar details. The\r\nprobable existence of an atmosphere of such a character used to be\r\ninferred from a phenomenon seen during total eclipses of the sun. On\r\nthese occasions the black body of the moon is invariably surrounded by a\r\nluminous halo, or glory, to which the name “corona” has been applied;\r\nand, further, besides this corona, apparently floating in it and\r\nsometimes seemingly attached to the black edge of the moon, are seen\r\nmasses of cloud-like matter of a bright red colour, which, from the form\r\nin which they were first seen and from their flame-like tinge, have\r\nbecome universally known as the “red-flames.” It used to be said that\r\nthis corona could only be the consequence of a lunar atmosphere lit up\r\nas it were by the sun’s rays shining through it, after the manner of a\r\nsunbeam lighting up the atmosphere of a dusty chamber; and the red\r\nflames were held by those who first observed them to be clouds of denser\r\nmatter floating in the said atmosphere, and refracting the red rays of\r\nsolar light as our own clouds are seen to do at sunrise and sunset. But\r\nthe evidence obtained, both by simple telescopic observation and by the\r\nspectroscope, from recent extensively observed eclipses of the sun has\r\nset this question quite at rest; for it has been settled finally and\r\nindisputably that both the above appearances pertain to the sun, and\r\nhave nothing whatever to do with the moon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of a solar eclipse offers other means in addition to the\r\nforegoing whereby a lunar atmosphere would be detected. We know that all\r\ngases and vapours absorb some portion of any light which may shine\r\nthrough them. If then our satellite had an atmosphere, its black nucleus\r\nwhen seen projected against the bright sun in an eclipse would be\r\nsurrounded by a sort of penumbra, or zone of shadow, in contact with its\r\nedge, somewhat like that we have shown in an exaggerated degree in the\r\nannexed cut (Fig. 11), and the passage of this penumbra over solar spots\r\nand other features of the solar photosphere would to some extent obscure\r\nthe more minute details of such features. No such dusky band has however\r\nbeen at any time observed. On the contrary, a band somewhat brighter\r\nthan the general surface of the sun has frequently been seen in contact\r\nwith the black edge of the moon: this in its turn was held to indicate\r\nan atmosphere about the moon; but Sir George Airy has shown that a lunar\r\natmosphere, if it really did exist, could not produce such an\r\nappearance, and that the cause of it must be sought in other directions.\r\nIf this effect were really due to the passage of the solar rays through\r\na lunar atmosphere a similar effect ought to be produced by the passage\r\nof the sun’s rays through the terrestrial atmosphere: and we might hence\r\nexpect to see the shadow of the earth projected on the moon during a\r\nlunar eclipse surrounded by a sort of bright zone or halo: we need\r\nhardly say such an appearance has never manifested itself. Similarly as\r\nwe stated that the delicate details of solar spots would be obscured by\r\na lunar atmosphere, small stars passing behind the moon would suffer\r\nsome diminution in brightness as they approached apparent contact with\r\nthe moon’s edge: this fading has been watched for on many occasions, and\r\nin a few cases such an appearance has been suspected, but in by far the\r\nmajority of instances nothing like a diminution of brightness or change\r\nof colour of the stars has been seen; stars of the smallest magnitude\r\nvisible under such circumstances retain their feeble lustre unimpaired\r\nup to the moment of their disappearance behind the moon’s limb.\r\n\r\nAgain, in a solar eclipse, even if there were an atmosphere about the\r\nmoon not sufficiently dense to form a hazy outline or impair the\r\ndistinctness of the details of a solar spot, it would still manifest its\r\nexistence in another way. As the moon advances upon the sun’s disc the\r\nlatter assumes, of course, a crescent form. Now if air or vapour\r\nenveloped the moon, the exceedingly delicate cusps of this crescent\r\nwould be distorted or turned out of shape. Instead of remaining\r\nsymmetrical, like the lower one in the annexed drawing (Fig. 12), they\r\nwould be bent or deformed after the manner we have shown in the upper\r\none. The slightest symptom of a distortion like this could not fail to\r\nobtrude itself upon an observer’s eye; but in no instance has anything\r\nof the kind been seen.\r\n\r\nReverting to the consequences of the terrestrial atmosphere: one of the\r\nmost striking of these is the phenomenon of diffused daylight, which we\r\nneed hardly remind the reader is produced by the scattering or diffusion\r\nof the sun’s rays among the minute particles of vapour composing or\r\ncontained in that atmosphere. Were it not for this reflexion and\r\ndiffusion of the sun’s light, those parts of our earth not exposed to\r\ndirect sunshine would be hidden in darkness, receiving no illumination\r\nbeyond the feeble amount that might be reflected from proximate\r\nterrestrial objects actually illuminated by direct sunlight. Twilight is\r\na consequence of this reflexion of light by the atmosphere when the sun\r\nis below the horizon. If, then, an atmosphere enveloped the moon, we\r\nshould see by diffused light those parts of the lunar details that are\r\nnot receiving the direct solar beams; and before the sun rose and after\r\nit had set upon any region of the moon, that region would still be\r\npartially illuminated by a twilight. But, on the contrary, the shadowed\r\nportions of a lunar landscape are pitchy black, without a trace of\r\ndiffused-light illumination, and the effects that a twilight would\r\nproduce are entirely absent from the moon. Once, indeed, one observer,\r\nSchroeter, noticed something which he suspected was due to an effect of\r\nthis kind: when the moon exhibited itself as a very slender crescent, he\r\ndiscovered a faint crepuscular light, extending from each of the cusps\r\nalong the circumference of the unenlightened part of the disc, and he\r\ninferred from estimates of the length and breadth of the line of light\r\nthat there was an atmosphere about the moon of 5376 feet in height. This\r\nis the only instance on record, we believe, of such an appearance being\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nSpectrum analysis would also betray the existence of a lunar atmosphere.\r\nThe solar rays falling on the moon are reflected from its surface to the\r\nearth. If, then, an atmosphere existed, it is plain that the solar rays\r\nmust first pass through such atmosphere to reach the reflecting surface,\r\nand returning from thence, again pass through it on their way to the\r\nearth; so that they must in reality pass through virtually twice the\r\nthickness of any atmosphere that may cover the moon. And if there be any\r\nsuch atmosphere, the spectrum formed by the moon’s light, that is, by\r\nthe sun’s light reflected from the moon, would be modified in such a\r\nmanner as to exhibit absorption-lines different from those found in the\r\nspectrum of the direct solar rays, just as the absorption-lines vary\r\naccording as the sun’s rays have to pass through a thinner or a denser\r\nstratum of the terrestrial atmosphere. Guided by this reasoning, Drs.\r\nHuggins and Miller made numerous observations upon the spectrum of the\r\nmoon’s light, which are detailed in the “Philosophical Transactions” for\r\nthe year 1864; and their result, quoting the words of the report, was\r\n“that the spectrum analysis of the light reflected from the moon is\r\nwholly negative as to the existence of any considerable lunar\r\natmosphere.”\r\n\r\nUpon another occasion, Dr. Huggins made an analogous observation of the\r\nspectrum of a star at the moment of its occultation, which observation\r\nhe records in the following words:—“When an observation is made of the\r\nspectrum of a star a little before, or at the moment of its occultation\r\nby the dark limb of the moon, several phenomena characteristic of the\r\npassage of the star’s light through an atmosphere might possibly present\r\nthemselves to the observer. If a lunar atmosphere exist, which either by\r\nthe substances of which it is composed, or by the vapours diffused\r\nthrough it, can exert a selective absorption upon the star’s light, this\r\nabsorption would be indicated to us by the appearance in the spectrum of\r\nnew dark lines immediately before the star is occulted by the moon.”\r\n\r\n“If finely divided matter, aqueous or otherwise, were present about the\r\nmoon, the red rays of the star’s light would be enfeebled in a smaller\r\ndegree than the rays of higher refrangibilities.”\r\n\r\n“If there be about the moon an atmosphere free from vapour, and\r\npossessing no absorptive power, but of some density, then the spectrum\r\nwould not be extinguished by the moon’s limb at the same instant\r\nthroughout its length. The violent and blue rays would lay behind the\r\nred rays.”\r\n\r\n“I carefully observed the disappearance of the spectrum of η Piscium at\r\nits occultation of January 4, 1865, for these phenomena; but no signs of\r\na lunar atmosphere were detected.”\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the strongest evidence of the non-existence of any\r\nappreciable lunar atmosphere is afforded by the non-refraction of the\r\nlight of a star passing behind the edge of the lunar disc. Refraction,\r\nwe know, is a bending of the rays of light coming from any object,\r\ncaused by their passage through strata of transparent matter of\r\ndifferent densities; we have a familiar example in the apparent bending\r\nof a stick when half plunged into water. There is a simple schoolboy’s\r\nexperiment which illustrates refraction in a very cogent manner, but\r\nwhich we should, from its very simplicity, hesitate to recall to the\r\nreader’s mind did it not very aptly represent the actual case we wish to\r\nexemplify. A coin is placed on the bottom of an empty basin, and the eye\r\nis brought into such a position that the coin is just hidden behind the\r\nbasin’s rim. Water is then poured into the basin and, without the eye\r\nbeing moved from its former place, as the depth of water increases, the\r\ncoin is brought by degrees fully into view; the water refracting or\r\nturning out of their course the rays of light coming from the coin, and\r\nlifting them, as it were, over the edge of the basin. Now a perfectly\r\nsimilar phenomenon takes place at every sunrise and sunset on the earth.\r\nWhen the sun is really below the horizon, it is nevertheless still\r\nvisible to us because it is _brought up_ by the refraction of its light\r\nby the dense stratum of atmosphere through which the rays have to pass.\r\nThe sun is, therefore, exactly represented by the coin at the bottom of\r\nthe basin in the boy’s experiment, the atmosphere answers to the water,\r\nand the horizon to the rim or edge of the basin. If there were no\r\natmosphere about the earth, the sun would not be so brought up above the\r\nhorizon, and, as a consequence, it would set earlier and rise later by\r\nabout a minute than it really does. This, of course, applies not merely\r\nto the sun, but to all celestial bodies that rise and set. Every planet\r\nand every star remains a shorter time below the horizon than it would if\r\nthere were no atmosphere surrounding the earth.\r\n\r\nTo apply this to the point we are discussing. The moon in her orbital\r\ncourse across the heavens is continually passing before, or occulting,\r\nsome of the stars that so thickly stud her apparent path. And when we\r\nsee a star thus pass behind the lunar disc on one side and come out\r\nagain on the other side, we are virtually observing the setting and\r\nrising of that star upon the moon. If, then, the moon had an atmosphere,\r\nit is clear, from analogy to the case of the earth, that the star must\r\ndisappear later and reappear sooner than if it has no atmosphere: just\r\nas a star remains too short a time below the earth’s horizon, or behind\r\nthe earth, in consequence of the terrestrial atmosphere, so would a star\r\nremain too short a time behind the moon if an atmosphere surrounded that\r\nbody. The point is settled in this way:—The moon’s apparent diameter has\r\nbeen measured over and over again and is known with great accuracy; the\r\nrate of her motion across the sky is also known with perfect accuracy:\r\nhence it is easy to calculate how long the moon will take to travel\r\nacross a part of the sky exactly equal in length to her own diameter.\r\nSupposing, then, that we observe a star pass behind the moon and out\r\nagain, it is clear that, if there be no atmosphere, the interval of time\r\nduring which it remains occulted ought to be exactly equal to the\r\ncomputed time which the moon would take to pass over the star. If,\r\nhowever, from the existence of a lunar atmosphere, the star disappears\r\ntoo late and reappears too soon, as we have seen it would, these two\r\nintervals will not agree; the computed time will be greater than the\r\nobserved time, and the difference, if any there be, will represent the\r\namount of refraction the star’s light has sustained or suffered, and\r\nhence the extent of atmosphere it has had to pass through.\r\n\r\nComparisons of these two intervals of time have been repeatedly made,\r\nthe most recent and most extensive was executed under the direction of\r\nthe Astronomer-Royal several years ago, and it was based upon no less\r\nthan 296 occultation observations. In this determination the measured or\r\ntelescopic semidiameter of the moon was compared with the semidiameter\r\ndeduced from the occultations, upon the above principle, and it was\r\nfound that the telescopic semidiameter was greater than the occultation\r\nsemidiameter by two seconds of angular measurement or by about a\r\nthousandth part of the whole diameter of the moon. Sir George Airy,\r\ncommenting on this result, says that it appears to him that the origin\r\nof this difference is to be sought in one of two causes. “Either it is\r\ndue to irradiation[3] of the telescopic semidiameter, and I do not doubt\r\nthat a part at least of the two seconds is to be ascribed to that cause;\r\nor it may be due to refraction by the moon’s atmosphere. If the whole\r\ntwo seconds were caused by atmospheric refraction this would imply a\r\nhorizontal refraction of one second, which is only 1/2000 part of the\r\nearth’s horizontal refraction. It is possible that an atmosphere\r\ncompetent to produce this refraction would not make itself visible in\r\nany other way.” This result accords well, considering the relative\r\naccuracy of the means employed, with that obtained a century ago by the\r\nFrench astronomer Du Séjour, who made a rigorous examination of the\r\nsubject founded on observations of the solar eclipse of 1764. He\r\nconcluded that the horizontal refraction produced by a possible lunar\r\natmosphere amounted to 1″·5—a second and a half—or about 1/1400 of that\r\nproduced by the earth’s atmosphere. The greater weight is of course to\r\nbe allowed to the more recent determination in consideration of the\r\nlarge number of accurate observations upon which it was based.\r\n\r\nBut an atmosphere 2,000 times rarer than our air can scarcely be\r\nregarded as an atmosphere at all. The contents of an air-pump receiver\r\ncan seldom be rarefied to a greater extent than to about 1/1000 of the\r\ndensity of air at the earth’s surface, with the best of pneumatic\r\nmachines; and the lunar atmosphere, if it exist at all, is thus proved\r\nto be twice as attenuated as what we are accustomed to recognise as a\r\nvacuum. In discussing the physical phenomena of the lunar surface, we\r\nare, therefore, perfectly justified in omitting all considerations of an\r\natmosphere, and adapting our arguments to the non-existence of such an\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nAnd if there be no air upon the moon, we are almost forced to conclude\r\nthat there can be no water; for if water covered any part of the lunar\r\nglobe it must be vapourised under the influence of the long period of\r\nuninterrupted sunshine (upwards of 300 hours) that constitutes the lunar\r\nday, and would manifest itself in the form of clouds or mists obscuring\r\ncertain parts of the surface. But, as we have already said, no such\r\nobliteration of details ever takes place; and, as we have further seen,\r\nno evidence of aqueous vapour is manifested upon the occasion of\r\nspectrum observations. Since, then, the effects of watery vapour are\r\nabsent, we are forced to conclude that the cause is absent also.\r\n\r\nThose parts of the moon which the ancient astronomers assumed, from\r\ntheir comparatively smooth and dusky appearance, to be seas, have long\r\nsince been discovered to be merely extensive regions of less reflective\r\nsurface material; for the telescope reveals to us irregularities and\r\nasperities covering well nigh the whole of them, which asperities could\r\nnot be seen if they were covered with water; unless, indeed, we admit\r\nthe possibility of seeing to the bottom of the water, not only\r\nperpendicularly, but obliquely. Some observers have noticed features\r\nthat have led them to suppose that water was at one time present upon\r\nthe moon, and has left its traces in the form of appearances of erosive\r\naction in some parts. But if water ever existed, where is it now? One\r\nwriter, it is true, has suggested as possible, that whatever air, and we\r\npresume he would include whatever water also, the moon may possess, is\r\nhidden away in sublunarean caves and hollows; but even if water existed\r\nin these places it must sometimes assume the vapoury form, and thus make\r\nits presence known.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel pointed out that if any moisture exists upon the moon,\r\nit must be in a continual state of migration from the illuminated or\r\nhot, to the unilluminated or cold side of the lunar globe. The\r\nalternations of temperature, from the heat produced by the unmitigated\r\nsunshine of 14 days’ duration, to the intensity of cold resulting from\r\nthe absence of any sunshine whatever for an equal period, must, he\r\nargued, produce an action similar to that of the _cryophorus_ in\r\ntransporting the lunar moisture from one hemisphere to the other. The\r\ncryophorus is a little instrument invented by the late Dr. Wollaston; it\r\nconsists of two bulbs of glass connected by a bent tube, in the manner\r\nshown in the annexed illustration, fig. 13. One of the bulbs, A, is\r\nhalf-filled with water, and, all air being exhausted, the instrument is\r\nhermetically sealed, leaving nothing within but the water and the\r\naqueous vapour which rises therefrom in the absence of atmospheric\r\npressure. When the empty bulb, B, is placed in a freezing mixture, a\r\nrapid condensation of this vapour takes place within it, and as a\r\nconsequence the water in the bulb A gives off more vapour. The\r\nabstraction of heat from the water, which is a natural consequence of\r\nthis evaporation, causes it to freeze into a solid mass of ice. Now upon\r\nthe moon the same phenomenon would occur did the material exist there to\r\nsupply it. In the accompanying diagram let A represent the illuminated\r\nor heated hemisphere of the moon, and B the dark or cold hemisphere; the\r\nformer being probably at a temperature of 300° above, and the latter\r\n200° below Fahrenheit’s zero. Upon the above principle, if moisture\r\nexisted upon A it would become vapourised, and the vapour would migrate\r\nover to B, and deposit itself there as hoarfrost; it would, therefore,\r\nmanifest itself to us while in the act of migrating by clouding or\r\ndimming the details about the boundary of the illuminated hemisphere.\r\nThe sun, rising upon any point upon the margin of the dark hemisphere,\r\nwould have to shine through a bed of moisture, and we may justly\r\nsuppose, if this were the case, that the tops of mountains catching the\r\nfirst beams of sunlight would be tinged with colour, or be lit up at\r\nfirst with but a faint illumination, just as we see in the case of\r\nterrestrial mountains whose summits catch the first, or receive the last\r\nbeams of the rising or setting sun. Nothing of this kind is, however,\r\nperceptible: when the solar rays tip the lofty peaks of lunar mountains,\r\nthese shine at once with brilliant light, quite as vivid as any of those\r\nparts that receive less horizontal illumination, or upon which the sun\r\nis almost perpendicularly shining.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence, then, that we have the means of obtaining, goes to\r\nprove that neither air nor water exist upon the moon. Two complicating\r\nelements affecting all questions relating to the geology of the\r\nterraqueous globe we inhabit may thus be dismissed from our minds while\r\nconsidering the physical features of the lunar surface. Fire on the one\r\nhand and water or the other, are the agents to which the configurations\r\nof the earth’s surface are referrable: the first of these produced the\r\nigneous rocks that form the veritable foundations of the earth, the\r\nsecond has given rise to the superstructure of deposits that constitute\r\nthe secondary and tertiary formations: were these last removed from the\r\nsurface of our planet, so as to lay bare its original igneous crust,\r\nthat crust, so far as reasoning can picture it to us, would probably not\r\ndiffer essentially from the visible surface of the moon. In considering\r\nthe causes that have given birth to the diversified features of that\r\nsurface, we may, therefore, ignore the influence of air and water action\r\nand confine our reasoning to igneous phenomena alone: our task in this\r\nmatter, it is hardly necessary to remark, is materially simplified\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now reached that stage of our subject at which it behoves us to\r\nrepair to the telescope for the purpose of examining and familiarising\r\nourselves with the various classes of detail that the lunar surface\r\npresents to our view.\r\n\r\nThat the moon is not a smooth sphere of matter is a fact that manifested\r\nitself to the earliest observers. The naked eye perceives on her face\r\nspots exhibiting marked differences of illumination. These variations of\r\nlight and shade, long before the invention of the telescope, induced the\r\nbelief that she possessed surface irregularities like those that\r\ndiversify the face of the earth, and from analogy it was inferred that\r\nseas and continents alternated upon the lunar globe. It was evident,\r\nfrom the persistence and invariability of the dusky markings, that they\r\nwere not due to atmospheric peculiarities, but were veritable variations\r\nin the character or disposition of the surface material. Fancy made\r\npictures of these unchangeable spots: untutored gazers detected in them\r\nthe indications of a human countenance, and perhaps the earliest map of\r\nthe moon was a rough reproduction of a man’s face, the eyes, nose and\r\nmouth representing the more salient spots discernible upon the lunar\r\ndisc. Others recognised in these spots the configuration of a human\r\nform, head, arms and legs complete, which a French superstition that\r\nlingers to the present day held to be the image of Judas Iscariot\r\ntransported to the moon in punishment for his treason. Again, an Indian\r\nnotion connects the lunar spots with a representation of a roebuck or a\r\nhare, and hence the Sanskrit names for the moon, _mrigadhara_, a\r\nroebuck-bearer, and _’sa’sabhrit_, a hare-bearer. Of these similitudes\r\nthe one which has the best pretensions to a rude accuracy is that first\r\nmentioned; for the resemblance of the full moon to a human countenance,\r\nwearing a painful or lugubrious expression, is very striking. Our\r\nillustration of the full moon (Plate III.) is derived from an actual\r\nphotograph;[4] the relative intensities of light and shade are hence\r\nsomewhat exaggerated; otherwise it represents the full moon very nearly\r\nas the naked eye sees it, and by gazing at the plate from a short\r\ndistance,[5] the well-known features will manifest themselves, while\r\nthey who choose may amuse themselves by arranging the markings in their\r\nimagination till they conform to the other appearances alluded to.\r\n\r\nWe may remark in passing that by one sect of ancient writers the moon\r\nwas supposed to be a kind of mirror, receiving the image of the earth\r\nand reflecting it back to terrestrial spectators. Humboldt affirmed that\r\nthis opinion had been preserved to his day as a popular belief among the\r\npeople of Asia Minor. He says, “I was once very much astonished to hear\r\na very well educated Persian from Ispahan, who certainly had never read\r\na Greek book, mention when I showed him the moon’s spots in a large\r\ntelescope in Paris, this hypothesis as a widely diffused belief in his\r\ncountry: ‘What we see in the moon,’ said the Persian, ‘is ourselves; it\r\nis the map of our earth.’” Quite as extravagant an idea, though perhaps\r\na more excusable one, was that held by some ancient philosophers, to the\r\neffect that the spots on the moon were the shadows of opaque bodies\r\nfloating in space between it and the sun.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n    FULL MOON.]\r\n\r\nAn observer watching the forms and positions of the lunar face-marks,\r\nfrom night to night and from lunation to lunation, cannot fail to notice\r\nthe circumstance that they undergo no easily perceptible change of\r\nposition with respect to the circular outline of the disc; that in fact\r\nthe face of the moon presented to our view is always the same, or very\r\nnearly so. If the moon had no orbital motion we should be led from the\r\nabove phenomenon to conclude that she had no axial motion, no movement\r\nof rotation; but when we consider the orbital motion in connection with\r\nthe permanence of aspect, we are driven to the conclusion—one, however,\r\nwhich superficial observers have some difficulty in recognising—that the\r\nmoon has an axial rotation equal in period to her orbital revolution.\r\nSince the moon makes the circuit of her orbit in twenty-seven days and\r\none-third (more exactly 27d. 7h. 43m. 11s.) it follows that this is the\r\ntime of her axial rotation, as referred to the stars, or as it would be\r\nmade out by an observer located at a fixed position in space outside the\r\nlunar orbit. But if referred to the sun this period appears different;\r\nbecause the moon while revolving round the earth is, with the earth,\r\ncirculating around the sun. Suppose the three bodies, moon, earth, and\r\nsun, to be in a line at a certain period of a lunation, as they are at\r\nfull moon: by the time the moon has completed her twenty-seven days’\r\njourney around the earth, the latter will have moved along twenty-seven\r\ndays’ march of its orbit, which is about twenty-seven degrees of\r\ncelestial longitude: the sun will apparently be that much distant from a\r\nstraight line passing through earth and moon, and the moon must\r\ntherefore move forward to overtake the sun before she can assume the\r\nfull phase again. She will take something over two days to do this;\r\nhence the solar period of her revolution becomes more than twenty-nine\r\ndays (to be exact, 29d. 12h. 44m. 2s. ·87). This is the length of a\r\nsolar day upon the moon—the interval from one sunrise to another at any\r\nspot upon the equator of our satellite, and the interval between\r\nsuccessive reappearances of the same phase to observers on the earth.\r\nThe physical cause of the coincidence of times of rotation and\r\nrevolution was touched upon in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the moon continuously presents to us the same\r\nhemisphere. This is generally true, but not entirely so. Galileo, by\r\nlong scrutiny, familiarised himself with every detail of the lunar-disc\r\nthat came within the limited grasp of his telescopes, and he recognised\r\nthe fact that according as the position of the moon varied in the sky,\r\nso the aspect of her face altered to a slight degree; that certain\r\nregions at the edge of her disc, alternately came in sight and receded\r\nfrom his view. He perceived, in fact, an _apparent_ rocking to and fro\r\nof the globe of the moon; a sort of balancing or _libratory_ motion.\r\nWhen the moon was near the horizon he could see spots upon her uppermost\r\nedge, which disappeared as she approached the zenith, or highest point\r\nof her nightly path; and as she neared this point, other spots, before\r\ninvisible, came into view, near to what had been her lower edge. Galileo\r\nwas not long in referring this phenomenon to its true cause. The centre\r\nof motion of the moon being the centre of the earth, it is clear that an\r\nobserver on the surface of the latter, looks down upon the rising moon\r\nas from an eminence, and thus he is enabled to see more or less over or\r\naround her. As the moon increases in altitude, the line of sight\r\ngradually becomes parallel to the line joining the observer and the\r\ncentre of the earth, and at length he looks her full in the face: he\r\nloses the full view and catches another side face view as she nears the\r\nhorizon in setting. This phenomenon, occurring as it does, with a daily\r\nperiod, is known as the _diurnal libration_.\r\n\r\nBut a kindred phenomenon presents itself in another period, and from\r\nanother cause. The moon rotates upon her axis at a speed that is\r\nrigorously uniform. But her orbital motion is not uniform, sometimes it\r\nis faster, and at other times slower than its average rate. Hence, the\r\nangle through which she moves along her orbit in a given time, now\r\nexceeds, and now falls short of the angle through which she turns upon\r\nher axis. Her visible hemisphere thus changes to an extent depending\r\nupon the difference between these orbital and axial angles, and the\r\napparent balancing thus produced is called the _libration in longitude_.\r\nThen there is a _libration in latitude_ due to the circumstance that the\r\naxis of the moon is not exactly perpendicular to the plane of her orbit;\r\nthe effect of this inclination being, that we sometimes see a little\r\nmore of the north than of the south polar regions of our satellite, and\r\n_vice versâ_.[6]\r\n\r\nThe extent of the moon’s librations, taking them all and in combination\r\ninto account, amounts to about seven degrees of arc of latitude or\r\nlongitude upon the moon, both in the north-south and east-west\r\ndirections. And taking into account the whole effect of them, we may\r\nconclude that our view of the moon’s surface, instead of being confined\r\nto one half, is extended really to about four-sevenths of the whole area\r\nof the lunar globe. The remaining three-sevenths must for ever remain a\r\n_terra incognita_ to the habitants of this earth, unless, indeed, from\r\nsome catastrophe which it would be wild fancy to anticipate, a period of\r\nrotation should be given to the moon different from that which it at\r\npresent possesses. Some highly fanciful theorists have speculated upon\r\nthe possible condition of the invisible hemisphere, and have propounded\r\nthe absurd notion that the opposite side of the moon is hollow, or that\r\nthe moon is a mere shell; others again have urged that the hidden half\r\nis more or less covered with water, and others again that it is peopled\r\nwith inhabitants. There is, however, no good reason for supposing that\r\nwhat we may call the back of the moon has a physical structure\r\nessentially different from the face presented towards us. So far as can\r\nbe judged from the peeps that libration enables us to obtain, the same\r\ncharacteristic features (though of course with different details)\r\nprevail over the whole lunar surface.\r\n\r\nThe speculative ideas held by the philosophers of the pre-telescopic\r\nage, touching the causes which produced the inequalities of light and\r\nshade upon the moon, received their _coup de grâce_ from the revelations\r\nof Galileo’s glasses. Our satellite was one of the earliest objects, if\r\nnot actually the first, upon which the Florentine turned his telescope;\r\nand he found that the inequalities upon her surface were due to\r\ndifferences in its configuration analogous to the continents and\r\nislands, and (as might then have been thought) the seas of our globe. He\r\ncould trace, even with his moderate means, the semblance of\r\nmountain-tops upon which the sun shone while their lower parts were in\r\nshadow, of hills that were brightly illuminated upon their sides towards\r\nthe sun, of brightly shining elevations, and deeply shadowed\r\ndepressions, of smooth plains, and regions of mountainous ruggedness. He\r\nsaw that the boundary of sunlight upon the moon was not a clearly\r\ndefined line, as it would be if the lunar globe were a smooth sphere, as\r\nthe Aristotelians had asserted, but that the terminator was uneven and\r\nbroken into an irregular outline. From these observations the Florentine\r\nastronomer concluded that the lunar world was covered not only with\r\nmountains like our globe, but with mountains whose heights far surpassed\r\nthose existing upon the earth, and whose forms were strangely limited to\r\ncircularity.\r\n\r\nGalileo’s best telescopes magnified only some thirty times, and the\r\nviews which he thus obtained, must have been similar to those exhibited\r\nby the smaller photographs of the moon produced in late years by Mr. De\r\nla Rue and now familiar to the scientific public. Of course there is in\r\nthe natural moon as viewed with a small telescope a vivid brilliancy\r\nwhich no art can imitate, and in photographs especially there is a\r\ntendency to exaggeration of the depths of shade in a lunar picture. This\r\narises from the circumstance that various regions of the moon do not\r\nimpress a chemically sensitized plate as they impress the retina of the\r\neye. Some portions, notably the so-called “seas” of the moon, which to\r\nthe eye appear but slightly duller than the brighter parts, give off so\r\nlittle _actinic_ light that they appear as nearly black patches upon a\r\nphotograph, and thus give an undue impression of the relative brightness\r\nof various parts of the lunar surface. Doubtless by sufficient exposure\r\nof the plate in the camera-telescope the dark patches might be rendered\r\nlighter, but in that case the more strongly illuminated portions, which\r\nafter all are those most desirable to be preserved, would be lost by the\r\neffect which photographers understand as “solarization.”\r\n\r\nIn speaking of a view of the moon with a magnifying power of thirty, it\r\nis necessary to bear in mind that the visible features will differ\r\nconsiderably with the diameter of the object-glass of the telescope to\r\nwhich this power is applied. The same details would not be seen alike\r\nwith the same power upon an object-glass of 10 inches diameter and one\r\nof 2 inches. The superior illumination of the image in the former case\r\nwould bring into view minute details that could not be perceived with\r\nthe smaller aperture. He who would for curiosity wish to see the moon,\r\nor any other object, as Galileo saw it, must use a telescope of the same\r\nsize and character in all respects as Galileo’s: it will not do to put\r\nhis magnifying power upon a larger telescope. With large telescopes, and\r\nlow powers used upon bright objects like the moon, there is a blinding\r\nflood of light which tends to contract the pupil of the eye and prevent\r\nthe passage of the whole of the pencil of rays coming through the\r\neye-piece. Although this last result may be productive of no\r\ninconvenience, it is clearly a waste of light, and it points to a rule\r\nthat the lowest power that a telescope should bear is that which gives a\r\npencil of light equal in diameter to the pupil of the eye under the\r\ncircumstances of brightness attendant upon the object viewed. In\r\nobserving faint objects this point assumes more importance, since it is\r\nthen necessary that all available light should enter the pupil. The\r\nthought suggests itself that an artificial enlargement of the pupil, as\r\nby a dose of belladonna, might be of assistance in searching for faint\r\nobjects, such as nebulæ and comets: but we prefer to leave the\r\nexperiment for those to try who pursue that branch of astronomical\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nA merely cursory examination of the moon with the low power to which we\r\nhave alluded is sufficient to show us the more salient features. In the\r\nfirst place we cannot help being struck with the immense preponderance\r\nof circular or craterform asperities, and with the general tendency to\r\ncircular shape which is apparent in nearly all the lunar surface\r\nmarkings; for even the larger regions known as the “seas” and the\r\nsmaller patches of the same character seem to repeat in their outlines\r\nthe round form of the craters. It is at the boundary of sunlight on the\r\nlunar globe that we see these craterform spots to the best advantage, as\r\nit is there that the rising or setting sun casts long shadows over the\r\nlunar landscape, and brings elevations and asperities into bold relief.\r\nThey vary greatly in size, some are so large as to bear an estimable\r\nproportion to the moon’s diameter, and the smallest are so minute as to\r\nneed the most powerful telescopes and the finest conditions of\r\natmosphere to perceive them. It is doubtful whether the smallest of them\r\nhave ever been seen, for there is no reason to doubt that there exist\r\ncountless numbers that are beyond the revealing powers of our finest\r\ntelescopes.\r\n\r\nFrom the great number and persistent character of these\r\ncircumvallations, Kepler was led to think that they were of artificial\r\nconstruction. He regarded them as pits excavated by the supposed\r\nhabitants of the moon to shelter themselves from the long and intense\r\naction of the sun. Had he known their real dimensions, of which we shall\r\nhave to speak when we come to describe them more in detail, he would\r\nhave hesitated in propounding such a hypothesis; nevertheless it was, to\r\na certain extent, justified by the regular and seemingly unnatural\r\nrecurrence of one particular form of structure, the like of which is,\r\ntoo, so seldom met with as a structural feature of the surface of our\r\nown globe.\r\n\r\nThe next most striking features, revealed by a low telescopic power upon\r\nthe moon, are the seemingly smooth plains that have the appearance of\r\ndusky spots, and that collectively cover a considerable portion—about\r\ntwo-thirds—of the entire disc. The larger of these spots retain the name\r\nof _seas_, the term having been given when they were supposed to be\r\nwatery expanses, and having been retained, possibly to avoid the\r\nconfusion inevitable from a change of name, after the existence of water\r\nupon the moon was disproved. Following the same order of nomenclature,\r\nthe smaller spots have received the appellations of _lakes_, _bays_ and\r\n_fens_. We see that many of these “seas” are partially surrounded by\r\nramparts or bulwarks which, under closer examination, and having regard\r\nto their real magnitude, resolve themselves into immense mountain\r\nchains. The general resemblance in form which the bulwarked plains thus\r\nexhibit to the circular craters of large size, would lead us to suppose\r\nthat the two classes of objects had the same formative origin, but when\r\nwe take into account the immense size of the former, and the process by\r\nwhich we infer the latter to have been developed, the supposition\r\nbecomes untenable.\r\n\r\nAnother of the prominent features which we notice as highly curious, and\r\nin some phases of the moon—at about the time of full—the most remarkable\r\nof all, are certain bright lines that appear to radiate from some of the\r\nmore conspicuous craters, and extend for hundreds of miles around. No\r\nselenological formations have so sorely puzzled observers as these\r\npeculiar streaks, and a great deal of fanciful theorizing has been\r\nbestowed upon them. As we are now only glancing at the moon, we do not\r\nenter upon explanations concerning them or any other class of details;\r\nall such will receive due consideration in their proper order in\r\nsucceeding chapters.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the classes of features observable upon the moon are\r\nnot great in number: they may be summed up as _craters_ and their\r\ncentral cones, _mountain chains_, with occasional isolated peaks,\r\n_smooth plains_, with more or less of irregularity of surface, and\r\n_bright radiating streaks_. But when we come to study with higher powers\r\nthe individual examples of each class we meet with considerable\r\ndiversity. This is especially the case with the craters, which appear\r\nunder very numerous variations of the one order of structure, viz., the\r\nring-form. A higher telescopic power shows us that not only do these\r\ncraters exist of all magnitudes within a limit of largeness, but\r\nseemingly with no limit of smallness, but that in their structure and\r\narrangement they present a great variety of points of difference. Some\r\nare seen to be considerably elevated above the surrounding surface,\r\nothers are basins hollowed out of that surface and with low surrounding\r\nramparts; some are merely like walled plains or amphitheatres with flat\r\nplateaux, while the majority have their lowest point of hollowness\r\nconsiderably below the general level of the surrounding surface; some\r\nare isolated upon the plains, others are aggregated into a thick crowd,\r\nand overlapping and intruding upon each other; some have elevated peaks\r\nor cones in their centres, and some are without these central cones,\r\nwhile the plateaux of others again contain several minute craters\r\ninstead; some have their ramparts whole and perfect, others have them\r\nbreached or malformed, and many have them divided into terraces,\r\nespecially on their inner sides.\r\n\r\nIn the plains, what with a low power appeared smooth as a water surface\r\nbecomes, under greater magnification, a rough and furrowed area, here\r\ngently undulated and there broken into ridges and declivities, with now\r\nand then deep rents or cracks extending for miles and spreading like\r\nriver-beds into numerous ramifications. Craters of all sizes and classes\r\nare scattered over the plains; these appear generally of a different\r\ntint to the surrounding surface, for the light reflected from the plains\r\nhas been observed to be slightly tinged with colour, The tint is not the\r\nsame in all cases: one large sea has a dingy greenish tinge, others are\r\nmerely grey and some others present a pale reddish hue. The cause of\r\nthis diversity of colour is mysterious; it has been supposed to indicate\r\nthe existence of vegetation of some sort; but this involves conditions\r\nthat we know do not exist.\r\n\r\nThe mountains, under higher magnification, do not present such diversity\r\nof formation as the craters, or at least the points of difference are\r\nnot so apparent; but they exhibit a plentiful variety of combinations.\r\nThere are a few perfectly isolated examples that cast long shadows over\r\nthe plains on which they stand like those of a towering cathedral in the\r\nrising or setting sun. Sometimes they are collected into groups, but\r\nmostly they are connected into stupendous chains. In one of the grandest\r\nof these chains, it has been estimated that a good telescope will show\r\n3000 mountains clustered together, without approach to symmetrical\r\norder. The scenery which they would present, could we get any other than\r\nthe “bird’s eye view” to which we are confined, must be imposing in the\r\nextreme, far exceeding in sublime grandeur anything that the Alps or the\r\nHimalayas offer; for while on the one hand the lunar mountains equal\r\nthose of the earth in altitude, the absence of an atmosphere, and\r\nconsequently of the effects produced thereby, must give rise to\r\nalternations of dazzling light and black depths of shade combining to\r\nform panoramas of wild scenery that, for want of a parallel on earth, we\r\nmay well call unearthly. But we are debarred the pleasure of actually\r\ncontemplating such pictures by the circumstance that we look _down_ upon\r\nthe mountain tops and into the valleys, so that the great height and\r\nclose aggregation of the peaks and hills are not so apparent. To compare\r\nthe lunar and terrestrial mountain scenery would be “to compare the\r\ndifferent views of a town seen from the car of a balloon, with the more\r\ninteresting prospects by a progress through the streets.” Some of the\r\npeculiarities of the lunar scenery we have, however, endeavoured to\r\nrealize in a subsequent Chapter.\r\n\r\nA high power gives us little more evidence than a low one upon the\r\nnature of the long bright streaks that radiate from some of the more\r\nconspicuous craters, but it enables us to see that those streaks do not\r\narise from any perceptible difference of level of the surface—that they\r\nhave no very definite outline, and that they do not present any sloping\r\nsides to catch more sunlight, and thus shine brighter, than the general\r\nsurface. Indeed, one great peculiarity of them is that they come out\r\nmost forcibly where the sun is shining perpendicularly upon them; hence\r\nthey are best seen where the moon is at full, and they are not visible\r\nat all at those regions upon which the sun is rising or setting. We also\r\nsee that they are not diverted by elevations in their path, as they\r\ntraverse in their course craters, mountains, and plains alike, giving a\r\nslight additional brightness to all objects over which they pass, but\r\nproducing no other effect upon them. To employ a commonplace simile,\r\nthey look as though, after the whole surface of the moon had assumed its\r\nfinal configuration, a vast brush charged with a whitish pigment had\r\nbeen drawn over the globe in straight lines radiating from a central\r\npoint, leaving its trail upon everything it touched, but obscuring\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the cause that produces this brightness of certain parts\r\nof the moon without reference to configuration of surface, this cause\r\nhas not been confined to the formation of the radiating lines, for we\r\nmeet with many isolated spots, streaks and patches of the same bright\r\ncharacter. Upon some of the plains there are small areas and lines of\r\nluminous matter possessing peculiarities similar to those of the\r\nradiating streaks, as regards visibility with the high sun, and\r\ninvisibility when the solar rays fall upon them horizontally. Some of\r\nthe craters also are surrounded by a kind of aureole of this highly\r\nreflective matter. A notable specimen is that called _Linné_, concerning\r\nwhich a great hue and cry about change of appearance and inferred\r\ncontinuance of volcanic action on the moon was raised some years ago.\r\nThis object is an insignificant little crater of about a mile or two in\r\ndiameter, in the centre of an ill-defined spot of the character referred\r\nto, and about eight or ten miles in diameter. With a low sun the crater\r\nalone is visible by its shadow; but as the luminary rises the shadow\r\nshortens and becomes all but invisible, and then the white spot shines\r\nforth. These alternations, complicated by variations of atmospheric\r\ncondition, and by the interpretations of different observers, gave rise\r\nto statements of somewhat exaggerated character to the effect that\r\nconsiderable changes, of the nature of volcanic eruptions, were in\r\nprogress in that particular region of the moon.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing remarks we have alluded somewhat indefinitely to high\r\npowers; and an enquiring but unastronomical reader may reasonably demand\r\nsome information upon this point. It might have been instructive to have\r\ncited the various details that may be said to come into view with\r\nprogressive increases of magnification. But this would be an all but\r\nimpossible task, on account of the varying conditions under which all\r\nastronomical observations must necessarily be made. When we come to\r\ndelicate tests, there are no standards of telescopic power and\r\ndefinition. Assuming the instrument to be of good size and high optical\r\ncharacter, there is yet a powerful influant of astronomical definition\r\nin the atmosphere and its variable state. Upon two-thirds of the clear\r\nnights of a year the finest telescopes cannot be used to their full\r\nadvantage, because the minute flutterings resulting from the passage of\r\nthe rays of light through moving strata of air of different densities\r\nare magnified just as the image in the telescope is magnified, till all\r\nminute details are blurred and confused, and only the grosser features\r\nare left visible. And supposing the telescope and atmosphere in good\r\nstate, there is still an important point, the state of the observer’s\r\neye, to be considered. After all it is the eye that sees, and the best\r\ntelescopic assistance to an untrained eye is of small avail. The eye is\r\nas susceptible of education and development as any other organ; a\r\nskilful and acute observer is to a mere casual gazer, what a watchmaker\r\nwould be to a ploughman, a miniature painter to a whitewasher. This fact\r\nis not generally recognized; no man would think of taking in hand an\r\nengraver’s burin, and expecting on the instant to use it like an adept,\r\nor of going to a smithy and without previous preparation trying to forge\r\na horse-shoe. Yet do folks enter observatories with uneducated eyes, and\r\nexpect at once to realize all the wonderful things that their minds have\r\npictured to themselves from the perusal of astronomical books. We have\r\nover and over again remarked the dissatisfaction which attends the first\r\nlooks of novices through a powerful telescope. They anticipate\r\nimmediately beholding wonders, and they are disappointed at finding how\r\nlittle they can see, and how far short the sight falls of what they had\r\nexpected. Courtesy at times leads them to express wonder and surprise,\r\nwhich it is easy to see is not really felt, but sometimes honesty\r\ncompels them to give expression to their disappointment. This arises\r\nfrom the simple fact that their eyes are not fit for the work which is\r\nfor the moment imposed upon them; they know not what to look for, or how\r\nto look for it. The first essay at telescopic gazing, like first essays\r\ngenerally, serves but to teach us our incapability.\r\n\r\nTo a tutored eye a great deal is visible with a comparatively low power,\r\nand practised observers strive to use magnifying powers as low as\r\npossible, so as to diminish, as far as may be, the evils arising from an\r\nuntranquil atmosphere. With a power so small as 30 or 40, many\r\nexceedingly delicate details on the moon are visible to an eye that is\r\nfamiliar with them under higher powers. With 200 we may say that every\r\nordinary detail will come out under favourable conditions; but when\r\nminute points of structure, mere nooks and corners as it were, are to be\r\nscrutinised, 300 may be used with advantage. Another hundred diameters\r\nalmost passes the practical limit. Unless the air be not merely fine,\r\nbut superfine, the details become “clothy” and tremulous; the extra\r\npoints brought out by the increased power are then only caught by\r\nmomentary glimpses, of which but a very few are obtained during a\r\nlengthy period of persistent scrutiny. We may set down 250 as the most\r\nuseful, and 350 the utmost effective power that can be employed upon the\r\nparticular work of which we are treating. Could every detail on the moon\r\nbe thoroughly and reliably represented as this amount of magnification\r\nshows it, the result would leave little to be wished for.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked by some, what is the absolute effect of such powers\r\nas those we have spoken of, in bringing the moon apparently nearer to\r\nour eyes? and what is the actual size of the smallest object visible\r\nunder the most favourable circumstances? A linear mile upon the moon\r\ncorresponds to an angular interval of 0·87 of a second; this refers to\r\nregions about the centre of the disc; near the circumference the\r\nforeshortening makes a difference, very great as the edge is approached.\r\nPerhaps the smallest angle that the eye can without assistance\r\nappreciate is half a minute; that is to say, an object that subtends to\r\nthe eye an arc of less than a half a minute can scarcely be seen.[7]\r\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, it follows that we must magnify\r\na spot a second in diameter upon the moon thirty times before we can see\r\nit; and since a second represents rather more than a mile, really about\r\n2000 yards, on the moon, as seen from the earth, the smallest object\r\nvisible with a power of 30 will be this number of yards in diameter or\r\nbreadth. To see an object 200 yards across, we should require to magnify\r\nit 300 times, and this would only bring it into view as a point; 20\r\nyards would require a power of 3000, and 1 yard 60,000 to effect the\r\nsame thing. Since, as we have said, the highest practicable power with\r\nour present telescopes, and at ordinary terrestrial elevations, is 350,\r\nor for an extreme say 400, it is evident that the minutest lunar object\r\nor detail of which we can perceive as a point must measure about 150\r\nyards: to see the form of an object, so as to discriminate whether it be\r\nround or square, it would require to be probably twice this size; for it\r\nmay be safely assumed that we cannot perceive the outline of an object\r\nwhose average breadth subtends a less angle than a minute.\r\n\r\nArago put this question into another shape:—The moon is distant from us\r\n237,000 miles (mean). A magnifying power of a thousand would show us the\r\nmoon as if she were distant 237 miles from the naked eye.\r\n\r\n   2000 would bring her within   118 miles.\r\n   4000    ”    ”    ”            59   ”\r\n   6000    ”    ”    ”            39   ”\r\n\r\nMont Blanc is visible to the naked eye from Lyons, at the distance of\r\nabout 100 miles; so that to see the mountains of the moon as Mont Blanc\r\nis seen from Lyons would require the impracticable power of 2500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                        TOPOGRAPHY OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to seek the reasons which prompted astronomers,\r\nsoon after the invention of the telescope, to map the surface features\r\nof the moon. They may have considered it desirable to record the\r\npositions of the spots upon her disc, for the purpose of facilitating\r\nobservations of the passage of the earth’s shadow over them in lunar\r\neclipses; or they may have been actuated by a desire to register\r\nappearances then existing, in order that if changes took place in after\r\nyears these might be readily detected. Scheiner was one of the earliest\r\nof lunar cartographers; he worked about the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury; but his delineations were very rough and exaggerated. Better\r\nmaps—the best of the time, according to an old authority—were engraved\r\nby one Mellan, about the years 1634 or 1635. At about the same epoch,\r\nLangreen and Hevelius were working upon the same subject. Langreen\r\nexecuted some thirty maps of portions of the moon, and introduced the\r\npractice of naming the spots after philosophers and eminent men.\r\nHevelius spent several years upon his task, the results of which he\r\npublished in a bulky volume containing some 50 maps of the moon in\r\nvarious phases, and accompanied by 500 pages of letter-press. He\r\nrejected Langreen’s system of nomenclature, and called the spots after\r\nthe seas and continents of the earth to which he conceived they bore\r\nresemblance. Riccioli, another selenographer, whose map was compiled\r\nfrom observations made by Grimaldi, restored Langreen’s nomenclature,\r\nbut he confined himself to the names of eminent astronomers, and his\r\nsystem has gained the adhesion of the map-makers of later times. Cassini\r\nprepared a large map from his own observations, and it was engraved\r\nabout the year 1692. It appears to have been regarded as a standard\r\nwork, for a reduced copy of it was repeatedly issued with the yearly\r\nvolumes of the _Connaissance des Temps_, (the “Nautical Almanac” of\r\nFrance) some time after its publication. These small copies have no\r\ngreat merit: the large copper plate of the original was, we are told by\r\nArago, who received the statement from Bouvard, sold to a brazier by a\r\ndirector of the French Government Printing-Office, who thought proper to\r\ndisembarrass the stores of that establishment, by ridding them of what\r\nhe considered lumber! La Hire, Mayer, and Lambert, followed during the\r\nsucceeding century, in this branch of astronomical delineation. At the\r\ncommencement of the present century, the subject was very earnestly\r\ntaken up by the indefatigable Schroeter, who, although he does not\r\nappear to have produced a complete map, produced a topograph of the moon\r\nin a large series of partial maps and drawings of special features.\r\nSchroeter was a fine observer, but his delineations show him to have\r\nbeen an indifferent draughtsman. Some of his drawings are but the rudest\r\nrepresentations of the objects he intended to depict; many of the bolder\r\nfeatures of conspicuous objects are scarcely recognizable in them. A bad\r\nartist is as likely to mislead posterity as a bad historian, and it\r\ncannot be surprising if observers of this or future generations,\r\naccepting Schroeter’s drawings as faithful representations, should infer\r\nfrom them remarkable changes in the lunar details. It is much to be\r\nregretted that Schroeter’s work should be thus depreciated. Lohrman of\r\nDresden, was the next cartographer of the moon; in 1824 he put forth a\r\nsmall but very excellent map of 15 inches diameter, and published a book\r\nof descriptive text, accompanied by sectional charts of particular\r\nareas. His work, however, was eclipsed by the great one which we owe to\r\nthe joint energy of MM. Beer and Maedler, and which represents a\r\nstupendous amount of observing work carried on during several years\r\nprior to 1836, the date of their publication. The long and patient\r\nlabour bestowed upon their map and upon the measures on which it\r\ndepends, deserve the highest praise which those conversant with the\r\nsubject can bestow, and it must be very long before their efforts can be\r\nsuperseded.\r\n\r\nBeer and Maedler’s map has a diameter of 37 inches: it represents the\r\nphase of the moon visible in the condition of mean libration. The\r\ndetails were charted by a careful process of triangulation. The disc was\r\nfirst divided into “triangles of the first order,” the points of which\r\n(conspicuous craters) were accurately laid down by reference to the\r\nedges of the disc: one hundred and seventy-six of these triangles,\r\nplotted accurately upon an orthographic projection of the hemisphere,\r\nformed the reliable basis for their charting work. From these a great\r\nnumber of “points of the second order” were laid down, by measuring\r\ntheir distance and angle of position with regard to points first\r\nestablished. The skeleton map thus obtained was filled up by drawings\r\nmade at the telescope: the diameters of the measureable craters being\r\ndetermined by the micrometer.\r\n\r\nBeer and Maedler also measured the heights of one thousand and\r\nninety-five lunar mountains and crater-summits: the resulting measures\r\nare given in a table contained in the comprehensive text-book which\r\naccompanies their map. These heights are found by one of two methods,\r\neither by measuring the length of the shadow which the object casts\r\nunder a known elevation of the sun above its horizon, or by measuring\r\nthe distance between the illuminated point of the mountain and the\r\n“terminator” in the following manner. In the annexed figure (Fig. 15)\r\nlet the circle represent the moon and M a mountain upon it: let S A be\r\nthe line of direction of the sun’s rays, passing the normal surface of\r\nthe moon at A and just tipping the mountain top. A will be the\r\nterminator, and there will be darkness between it and the star-like\r\nmountain summit M. The distance between A and M is measured: the\r\ndistance A B is known, for it is the moon’s radius. And since the line S\r\nM is a tangent to the circle the angle B A M is a right angle. We know\r\nthe length of its two sides AB, AM, and we can therefore by the known\r\nproperties of the right-angled triangle find the length of the\r\nhypothenuse BM: and since BM is made up of the radius BA plus the\r\nmountain height, we have only to subtract the moon’s radius from the\r\nascertained whole length of the hypothenuse and we have the height of\r\nthe mountain. MM. Beer and Maedler exhibited their measures in French\r\ntoises: in the heights we shall have occasion to quote, these have been\r\nturned into English feet, upon the assumption that the toise is equal to\r\n6·39 English feet. The nomenclature of lunar features adopted by Beer\r\nand Maedler is that introduced by Riccioli: mountains and features\r\nhitherto undistinguished were named by them after ancient and modern\r\nphilosophers, in continuance of Riccioli’s system, and occasionally\r\nafter terrestrial features. Some minute objects in the neighbourhood of\r\nlarge and named ones were included under the name of the large one and\r\ndistinguished by Greek or Roman letters.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n    PICTURE MAP OF THE MOON.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n    Skeleton Map of Moon\r\n    To Accompany Picture Map, Chap. VII]\r\n\r\nThe excellent map resulting from the arduous labours of these\r\nastronomers is simply a map: it does not pretend to be a picture. The\r\nasperities and depressions are symbolized by a conventional system of\r\nshading and no attempt is made to exhibit objects as they actually\r\nappear in the telescope. A casual observer comparing details on the map\r\nwith the same details on the moon itself would fail to identify or\r\nrecognize them except where the features are very conspicuous. Such an\r\nobserver would be struck by the shadows by which the lunar objects\r\nreveal themselves: he would get to know them mostly by their shadows,\r\nsince it is mainly by those that their forms are revealed to a\r\nterrestrial observer. But such a map as that under notice indicates no\r\nshadows, and objects have to be identified upon it rather by their\r\npositions with regard to one another or to the borders of the moon than\r\nby any notable features they actually present to view. This\r\ninconvenience occurred to us in our early use of Beer and Maedler’s\r\nchart, and we were induced to prepare for ourselves a map in which every\r\nobject is shown somewhat, if imperfectly, as it actually appears at some\r\nperiod of a lunation. This was done by copying Beer and Maedler’s\r\noutlines and filling them up by appropriate shading. To do justice to\r\nour task we enlarged our map to a diameter of six feet. Upon a circle of\r\nthis diameter the positions and dimensions of all objects were laid down\r\nfrom the German original. Then from our own observations we depicted the\r\ngeneral aspect of each object: and we so adjusted the shading that all\r\nobjects should be shown under about the same angle of illumination—a\r\ncondition which is never fulfilled upon the moon itself, but which we\r\nconsider ourselves justified in exhibiting for the purpose of conveying\r\na fair impression of how the various lunar objects actually appear at\r\nsome one or other part of a lunation.\r\n\r\nThe picture-map thus produced has been photographed to the size\r\nconvenient for this work: and in order to make it available for the\r\nidentification of such objects as we may have occasion to refer to, we\r\nhave placed around it a co-ordinate scale of arbitrary divisions by\r\nwhich any object can be found as by the latitude and longitude divisions\r\nupon a common geographical map. We have also prepared a skeleton map\r\nwhich includes the more conspicuous objects, and which faces the picture\r\nmap (Plates IV. and V.)

We have, however, thought that a few remarks upon\r\nthe salient features of a few of the most important may be acceptable in\r\nexplanation of our illustrative plates; and what we have to say of the\r\nfew may be taken as representative of the many.\r\n\r\n\r\n               COPERNICUS, 147—(49·8—107·0). Plate VIII.\r\n\r\nThis may deservedly be considered as one of the grandest and most\r\ninstructive of lunar craters. Although its vast diameter (46 miles) is\r\nexceeded by others, yet, taken as a whole, it forms one of the most\r\nimpressive and interesting objects of its class. Its situation, near the\r\ncentre of the lunar disc, renders all its wonderful details, as well as\r\nthose of its immediately surrounding objects, so conspicuous as to\r\nestablish it as a very favourite object. Its vast rampart rises to\r\nupwards of 12,000 feet above the level of the plateau, nearly in the\r\ncentre of which stands a magnificent group of cones, three of them\r\nattaining the height of upwards of 2400 feet.\r\n\r\nThe rampart is divided by concentric segmental terraced ridges, which\r\npresent every appearance of being enormous landslips, resulting from the\r\ncrushing of their over-loaded summits, which have slid down in vast\r\nsegments and scattered their débris on to the plateau. Corresponding\r\nvacancies in the rampart may be observed from whence these prodigious\r\nmasses have broken away. The same may be noticed, although in a somewhat\r\nmodified degree, around the exterior of the rampart. In order to\r\napproach a realization of the sublimity and grandeur of this magnificent\r\nexample of a lunar volcanic crater, our reader would do well to\r\nendeavour to fix his attention on its enormous magnitude and attempt to\r\nestablish in his mind’s eye a correct conception of the scale of its\r\ndetails as well as its general dimensions, which, as they so\r\nprodigiously transcend those of the largest terrestrial volcanic\r\ncraters, require that our ideas as to magnitude of such objects should\r\nbe, so to speak, educated upon a special standard. It is for this reason\r\nwe are anxious our reader, when examining our illustrations, should\r\nconstantly refer the objects represented in them to the scale of miles\r\nappended to each plate, otherwise a just and true conception of the\r\ngrandeur of the objects will escape him.\r\n\r\nCopernicus is specially interesting, as being evidently the result of a\r\nvast discharge of molten matter which has been ejected at the focus or\r\ncentre of disruption of an extensively upheaved portion of the lunar\r\ncrust. A careful examination of the crater and the district around it,\r\neven to the distance of more than 100 miles on every side, will supply\r\nunmistakable evidence of the vast extent and force of the original\r\ndisruption, manifested by a wonderfully complex reticulation of bright\r\nstreaks which diverge in every direction from the crater as their common\r\ncentre. These streaks do not appear on our plate, nor are they seen upon\r\nthe moon except at and near the full phase. They show conspicuously,\r\nhowever, by their united lustre on the full moon, Plate III. Every one\r\nof those bright streaks, we conceive, is a record of what was originally\r\na crack or chasm in the solid crust of the moon, resulting from some\r\nvastly powerful upheaving agency over the site of whose focus of energy\r\nCopernicus stands. The cracking of the crust must have been followed by\r\nthe ejection of subjacent molten matter up through the reticulated\r\ncracks; this, spreading somewhat on either side of them, has left these\r\nbright streaks as a visible record of the force and extent of the\r\nupheaval; while at the focus of disruption from whence the cracks\r\ndiverge, the grand outburst appears to have taken place, leaving\r\nCopernicus as its record and result.\r\n\r\nMany somewhat radial ridges or spurs may be observed leading away from\r\nthe exterior banks of the great rampart. These appear to be due to the\r\nmore free egress which the extruded matter would find near the focus of\r\ndisruption. The spur-ridges may be traced fining away for fully 100\r\nmiles on all sides, until they become such delicate objects as to\r\napproach invisibility. Several vast open chasms or cracks may be\r\nobserved around the exterior of the rampart. They appear to be due to\r\nsome action subsequent to the formation of the great crater—probably the\r\nresult of contraction on the cooling of the crust, or of a deep-seated\r\nupheaval long subsequent to that which resulted in the formation of\r\nCopernicus itself, as they intersect objects of evidently prior\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nUnder circumstances specially favourable for “fine vision,” for upwards\r\nof 70 miles on all sides around Copernicus, myriads of comparatively\r\nminute but perfectly-formed craters may be observed. The district on the\r\nsouth-east side is specially rich in these wonderfully thickly-scattered\r\ncraters, which we have reason to suppose stand over or upon the\r\nreticulated bright streaks; but, as the circumstances of illumination\r\nwhich are requisite to enable us to detect the minute craters are widely\r\nadverse to those which render the bright streaks visible, namely, nearly\r\nfull moon for the one and gibbous for the other, it is next to\r\nimpossible to establish the fact of coincidence of the sites of the two\r\nby actual simultaneous observation.\r\n\r\nAt the east side of the rampart, multitudes of these comparatively\r\nminute craters may also be detected, although not so closely crowded\r\ntogether as those on the west side; but among those on the east may be\r\nseen myriads of minute prominences roughening the surface; on close\r\nscrutiny these are seen to be small mounds of extruded matter which, not\r\nhaving been ejected with sufficient energy to cause the erupted material\r\nto assume the crater form around the vent of ejection, have simply\r\nassumed the mound form so well known to be the result of volcanic\r\nejection of moderate force.\r\n\r\nWere we to select a comparatively limited portion of the lunar surface\r\nabounding in the most unmistakable evidence of volcanic action in every\r\nvariety that can characterize its several phases, we could not choose\r\none yielding in all respects such instructive examples as Copernicus and\r\nits immediate surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                GASSENDI, 90—(59·7—123·3). Frontispiece.\r\n\r\nAn interesting crater about 54 miles diameter; the height of the most\r\nelevated portion of the surrounding wall from the plateau being about\r\n9600 feet. The centre is occupied by a group of conical mountains, three\r\nof which are most conspicuous objects and rise to nearly 7000 feet above\r\nthe level of the plateau. As in other similar cases, these central\r\nmountains are doubtless the result of the expiring effort of the\r\neruption which had formed the great circular wall of the crater. The\r\nplateau is traversed by several deep cracks or chasms nearly one mile\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nBoth the interior and exterior of the wall of the crater are terraced\r\nwith the usual segmental ridges or landslips. A remarkable detached\r\nportion of the interior bank is to be seen on the east side, while on\r\nthe west exterior of the wall may be seen an equally remarkable example\r\nof an outburst of lava subsequent to the formation of the wall or bank\r\nof the crater; it is of conical form and cannot fail to secure the\r\nattention of a careful observer.\r\n\r\nInterpolated on the north wall of the crater may be seen a crater of\r\nabout 18 miles diameter which has burst its bank in towards the great\r\ncrater, upon whose plateau the lava appears to have discharged itself.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Gassendi is diversified by a vast number of mounds\r\nand long ridges of exudated matter, and also traversed by enormous\r\nchasms and cracks, several of which exceed one mile wide and are fully\r\n100 miles in length, and, as is usual with such cracks, traverse plain\r\nand mountain alike, disregarding all surface inequalities.\r\n\r\nNumbers of small craters are scattered around; the whole forming an\r\ninteresting and instructive portion of the lunar surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n   EUDOXUS, 208 (29·7—88·0), and ARISTOTLE, 209 (30·0—84·6). Plate X.\r\n\r\nTwo gigantic craters, Eudoxus being nearly 35 miles in diameter and\r\nupwards of 11,000 feet deep, while Aristotle is about 48 miles in\r\ndiameter, and about 10,000 feet deep (measuring from the summit of the\r\nrampart to the plateau). These two magnificent craters present all the\r\ntrue volcanic characteristics in a remarkable degree. The outsides as\r\nwell as the insides of their vast surrounding walls or banks display on\r\nthe grandest scale the landslip feature, the result of the over-piling\r\nof the ejected material, and the consequent crushing down and crumbling\r\nof the substructure. The true eruptive character of the action which\r\nformed the craters is well evinced by the existence of the groups of\r\nconical mountains which occupy the centres of their circular plateaux,\r\nsince these conical mountains, there can be little doubt, stand over\r\nwhat were once the vents from whence the ejected matter of the craters\r\nwas discharged.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of these grand craters may be seen myriads of\r\ncomparatively minute ones (we use the expression “comparatively minute,”\r\nalthough most of them are fully a mile in diameter). So thickly are\r\nthese small craters crowded together, that counting them is totally out\r\nof the question; in our original notes we have termed them “Froth\r\ncraters” as the most characteristic description of their aspect.\r\n\r\nThe exterior banks of Aristotle are characterized by radial ridges or\r\nspurs: these are most probably the result of the flowing down of great\r\ncurrents of very fluid lava. To the east of the craters some very lofty\r\nmountains of exudation may be seen, and immediately beyond them an\r\nextensive district of smaller mountains of the same class, so thickly\r\ncrowded together as under favourable illumination to present a multitude\r\nof brilliant points of light contrasted by intervening deep shade. On\r\nthe west bank of Aristotle a very perfect crater may be seen, 27 miles\r\nin diameter, having all the usual characteristic features.\r\n\r\nAbout 40 miles to the east of Eudoxus there is a fine example of a crack\r\nor fissure extending fully 50 miles—30 miles through a plain, and the\r\nremaining 20 miles cutting through a group of very lofty mountains. This\r\ngreat crack is worthy of attention, as giving evidence of the\r\ndeep-seated nature of the force which occasioned it, inasmuch as it\r\ndisregards all surface impediments, traversing plain and group of\r\nmountains alike.\r\n\r\nThere are several other features in and around these two magnificent\r\ncraters well worthy of careful observation and scrutiny, all of them\r\nexcellent types of their respective classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                TRIESNEKER, 150 (35·5—109·8). Plate XI.\r\n\r\nA fine example of a normal lunar volcanic crater, having all the usual\r\ncharacteristic features in great perfection. Its diameter is about 20\r\nmiles, and it possesses a good example of the central cone and also of\r\ninterior terracing.\r\n\r\nThe most notable feature, however, in connection with this crater, and\r\non account of which we have chosen it as a subject for one of our\r\nillustrations, is the very remarkable display of chasms or cracks which\r\nmay be seen to the west side of it. Several of these great cracks\r\nobviously diverge from a small crater near the west external bank of the\r\ngreat one, and they subdivide or branch out, as they extend from the\r\napparent point of divergence, while they are crossed or intersected by\r\nothers. These cracks or chasms (for their width merits the latter\r\nappellation) are nearly one mile broad at the widest part, and after\r\nextending to fully 100 miles, taper away till they become invisible.\r\nAlthough they are not test objects of the highest order of difficulty,\r\nyet to see them with perfect distinctness requires an instrument of some\r\nperfection and all the conditions of good vision. When such are present,\r\na keen and practised eye will find many details to rivet its attention,\r\namong which are certain portions of the edges of these cracks or chasms\r\nwhich have fallen in and caused interruptions to their continuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n THEOPHILUS, 97 (22·3—120·0). CYRILLUS, 96 (23·5—121·3). CATHARINA, 95\r\n                        (24·7—124·0). Plate XII.\r\n\r\nThese three magnificent craters form a very conspicuous group near the\r\nmiddle of the south-east quarter of the lunar disc.\r\n\r\nTheir respective diameters and depths are as follows:—\r\n\r\nTheophilus, 64 miles diameter; depth of plateau from summit of crater\r\nwall, 16,000 feet; central cone, 5200 feet high.\r\n\r\nCyrillus, 60 miles diameter; depth of plateau from summit of crater\r\nwall, 15,000 feet; central cone, 5800 feet high.\r\n\r\nCatharina, 65 miles diameter; depth of plateau from summit of crater\r\nwall, 13,000 feet; centre of plateau occupied by a confused group of\r\nminor craters and débris.\r\n\r\nEach of these three grand craters is full of interesting details,\r\npresenting in every variety the characteristic features which so\r\nfascinate the attention of the careful observer of the moon’s wonderful\r\nsurface, and affording unmistakable evidence of the tremendous energy of\r\nthe volcanic forces which at some inconceivably remote period piled up\r\nsuch gigantic formations.\r\n\r\nTheophilus by its intrusion within the area of Cyrillus shows in a very\r\nstriking manner that it is of comparatively more recent formation than\r\nthe latter crater. There are many such examples in other parts of the\r\nlunar disc, but few of so very distinct and marked a character.\r\n\r\nThe flanks or exterior banks of Theophilus, especially those on the west\r\nside, are studded with apparently minute craters, all of which when\r\ncarefully scrutinized are found to be of the true volcanic type of\r\nstructure; and minute as they are, by comparison, they would to a\r\nbeholder close to them appear as very imposing objects; but so gigantic\r\nare the more notable craters in the neighbourhood, that we are apt to\r\noverlook what are in themselves really large objects. It is only by duly\r\ntraining the mind, as we have previously urged, so as ever to keep\r\nbefore us the vast scale on which the volcanic formations of the lunar\r\nsurface are displayed, that we can do them the justice which their\r\nintrinsic grandeur demands. We trust that our illustrations may in some\r\nmeasure tend to educate the mind’s eye, so as to derive to the full the\r\ntranquil enjoyment which results from the study of the manifestation of\r\none of the Creator’s most potent agencies in dealing with the materials\r\nof his worlds, namely, volcanic force. So rich in wonderful features and\r\ncharacteristic details is this magnificent group and its neighbourhood,\r\nthat a volume might be filled in the attempt to do justice, by\r\ndescription, to objects so full of suggestive subject for study.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THEBIT, 85—(40·8—126·8).\r\n\r\nA crater about 32 miles in diameter and about 9700 feet deep, devoid of\r\na central cone. It appears on the upper part and near the middle of\r\nPlate XIII. The plateau has five minute craters upon it. On the east\r\noutside are two small craters, the lesser of which, about 2·75 miles\r\ndiameter, has a central cone. We specially note this fact, because it is\r\nthe smallest crater but one in which we have detected a central cone: no\r\ndoubt, however, many smaller craters possess this unmistakable stamp of\r\ntrue volcanic origin, but so minute are the specks of light which the\r\ncentral cones of such very small craters reflect, that they fail to be\r\nvisible to us.\r\n\r\nEast of Thebit is a very remarkable straight cliff 60 miles long by\r\nabout 1000 feet high, called by some observers the “Railway,” and\r\napparently the result either of an upheaval or of a down-sinking of the\r\nsurface of the circular area across whose diameter it stretches.\r\n\r\nUnder moderate magnifying power, this cliff appears straight, but with\r\nhigher power and under favourable conditions, its face is seen to be\r\nserrated, and along the upper edge may be detected several very minute\r\ncraters. A more conspicuous small crater is seen at the north end of the\r\ncliff. To the east of the cliff nearly opposite the centre are two\r\ncraters, from the east side of the larger of which proceeds a fine crack\r\nparallel to the cliff and passing through a dome-shaped hill of low\r\neminence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PLATO, 210 (41·8—81·8). Plate XIV.\r\n\r\nThis crater, besides being a conspicuous object on account of its great\r\ndiameter, has many interesting details in and around it requiring a fine\r\ninstrument and favourable circumstances to render them distinctly\r\nvisible. The diameter of the crater is 70 miles; the surrounding wall or\r\nrampart varies in height from 4000 to upwards of 8000 feet, and is\r\nserrated with noble peaks which cast their black shadows across the\r\nplateau in a most picturesque manner, like the towers and spires of a\r\ngreat cathedral. Reference to our illustration will convey a very fair\r\nidea of this interesting appearance. On the north-east inside of the\r\ncircular wall or rampart may be observed a fine example of landslip, or\r\nsliding down of a considerable mass of the interior side of the crater’s\r\nwall. The landslip nature of this remarkable detail is clearly\r\nestablished by the fact of the bottom edge of the downslipped mass\r\nprojecting in towards the centre of the plateau to a considerable\r\nextent. Other smaller landslip features may be seen, but none on so\r\ngrand and striking a scale as the one referred to. A number of\r\nexceedingly minute craters may be detected on the surface of the\r\nplateau. The plateau itself is remarkable for its low reflective power,\r\nwhich causes it to look like a dingy spot when Plato is viewed with a\r\nsmall magnifying power. The exterior of the crater wall is remarkable\r\nfor the rugged character of its formation, and forms a great contrast in\r\nthat respect to the comparatively smooth unbroken surface of the\r\nplateau, which by the way is devoid of a central cone. The surrounding\r\nfeatures and objects indicated in our illustration are of the highest\r\ninterest, and a few of them demand special description.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE VALLEY OF THE ALPS (37·0—86·0). Plate XIV.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable object lays somewhat diagonally to the west of Plato;\r\nwhen seen with a low magnifying power (80 or 100), it appears as a rut\r\nor groove tapering towards each extremity. It measures upwards of 75\r\nmiles long by about six miles wide at the broadest part. When examined\r\nunder favourable circumstances, with a magnifying power of from 200 to\r\n300, it is seen to be a vast flat-bottomed valley bordered by gigantic\r\nmountains, some of which attain heights upwards of 10,000 feet; towards\r\nthe south-east of this remarkable valley, and on both sides of it, are\r\ngroups of isolated mountains, several of which are fully 8000 feet high.\r\nThis flat-bottomed valley, which has retained the integrity of its form\r\namid such disturbing forces as its immediate surroundings indicate, is\r\none of the many structural enigmas with which the lunar surface abounds.\r\nTo the north-west of the valley a vast number of isolated mounds or\r\nsmall mountains of exudation may be seen; so numerous are they as to\r\ndefy all attempts to count them with anything like exactness; and among\r\nthem, a power of 200 to 300 will enable an observer, under favourable\r\ncircumstances, to detect vast numbers of small but perfectly-formed\r\ncraters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PICO, 211 (41·9—87·3). Plate XIV.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most interesting examples of an isolated volcanic\r\n“mountain of exudation,” and it forms a very striking object when seen\r\nunder favourable circumstances. Its height is upwards of 8000 feet, and\r\nit is about three times as long at the base as it is broad. The summit\r\nis cleft into three peaks, as may be ascertained by the three-peaked\r\nshadow it casts on the plain. Five or six minute craters of very perfect\r\nform may be detected close to the base of this magnificent mountain.\r\nThere are several other isolated peaks or mountains of the same class\r\nwithin 30 or 40 miles of it which are well worthy of careful scrutiny,\r\nbut Pico is the master of the situation, and offers a glorious subject\r\nfor realizing a lunar day-dream in the mind’s eye, if we can only by an\r\neffort of imagination conceive its aspect under the fiercely brilliant\r\nsunshine by which it is illuminated, contrasted with the intensely black\r\nlunar heavens studded with stars shining with a steady brightness of\r\nwhich, by reason of _our_ atmosphere intervening, we can have no\r\nadequate conception save by the aid of a well-directed imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   TYCHO, 30 (43·0—142·3). Plate XVI.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent crater, which occupies the centre of the crowded group\r\nin our Plate, is 54 miles in diameter, and upwards of 16,000 feet deep,\r\nfrom the highest ridge of the rampart to the surface of the plateau,\r\nwhence rises a grand central cone 5000 feet high. It is one of the most\r\nconspicuous of all the lunar craters, not so much on account of its\r\ndimensions as from its occupying the great focus of disruption from\r\nwhence diverge those remarkable bright streaks, many of which may be\r\ntraced over 1000 miles of the moon’s surface, disregarding in their\r\ncourse all interposing obstacles. There is every reason to conclude that\r\nTycho is an instance of a vast disruptive action which rent the solid\r\ncrust of the moon into radiating fissures, which were subsequently\r\noccupied by extruded molten matter, whose superior luminosity marks the\r\ncourse of the cracks in all directions from the crater as their common\r\ncentre of divergence. So numerous are these bright streaks when examined\r\nby the aid of the telescope, and they give to this region of the moon’s\r\nsurface such an extra degree of luminosity, that, when viewed as a\r\nwhole, their locality can be distinctly seen at full moon by the\r\nunassisted eye as a bright patch of light on the southern portion of the\r\ndisc. (See Plate III.) The causative origin of the streaks is discussed\r\nand illustrated in Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nThe interior of this fine crater presents striking examples of the\r\nconcentric terrace-like formations that we have elsewhere assigned to\r\nvast landslip actions. Somewhat similar concentric terraces may be\r\nobserved in other lunar craters; some of these, however, appear to be\r\nthe results of some temporary modification of the ejective force, which\r\nhas caused the formation of more or less perfect inner ramparts: what we\r\nconceive to be true landslip terraces are always distinguished from\r\nthese by their more or less fragmentary character.\r\n\r\nOn reference to Plate III., showing the full moon, a very remarkable and\r\nspecial appearance will be observed in a dingy district or zone\r\nimmediately surrounding the exterior of the rampart of Tycho, and of\r\nwhich we venture to hazard what appears to us a rational explanation:\r\nnamely, that as Tycho may be considered to have acted as a sort of\r\nsafety-valve to the rending and ejective force which caused, in the\r\nfirst instance, the cracking of this vast portion of the moon’s\r\ncrust—the molten matter that appears to have been forced up through\r\nthese cracks, on finding a comparatively free exit by the vent of Tycho,\r\nso relieved the district immediately around him as to have thereby\r\nreduced, in amount, the exit of the molten matter, and so left a zone\r\ncomparatively free from the extruded lava which, according to our view\r\nof the subject, came up simultaneously through the innumerable fissures,\r\nand, spreading sideways along their courses, left everlasting records of\r\nthe original positions of the radiating cracks in the form of the bright\r\nstreaks which we now behold.\r\n\r\n\r\n               “WARGENTIN,” 26 (57·5—140·2). Plate XVII.\r\n\r\nThis object is quite unique of its kind—a crater about 53 miles across\r\nthat to all appearance has been filled to the brim with lava that has\r\nbeen left to consolidate. There are evidences of the remains of a\r\nrampart, especially on the south-west portion of the rim. The general\r\naspect of this extraordinary object has been not unaptly compared to a\r\n“thin cheese.” The terraced and rutted exterior of the rampart has all\r\nthe usual characteristic details of the true crater. The surface of the\r\nhigh plateau is marked by a few ridges branching from a point nearly in\r\nits centre, together with some other slight elevations and depressions;\r\nthese, however, can only be detected when the sun’s rays fall nearly\r\nparallel to the surface of the plateau.\r\n\r\nTo the north of this interesting object is the magnificent ring\r\nformation Schickard, whose vast diameter of 123 miles contrasts\r\nstrikingly with that of the sixteen small craters within his rampart,\r\nand equally so with a multitude of small craters scattered around. There\r\nare many objects of interest on the portion of the lunar surface\r\nincluded within our illustration, but as they are all of the usual type,\r\nwe shall not fatigue the attention of our readers by special\r\ndescriptions of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nARISTARCHUS, 176 (6·3—99·2), and HERODOTUS, 175 (63·2—99·6). Plate XVIII.\r\n\r\nThese two fine examples of lunar volcanic craters are conspicuously\r\nsituated in the north-east quarter of the moon’s disc. Aristarchus has a\r\ncircular rampart nearly 28 miles diameter, the summit of which is about\r\n7500 feet above the surface of the plateau, while its height above the\r\ngeneral surface of the moon is 2600 feet. A central cone having several\r\nsubordinate peaks completes the true volcanic character of this crater:\r\nits rampart banks, both outside and inside, have fine examples of the\r\nsegmental crescent-shaped ridges or landslips, which form so constant\r\nand characteristic a feature in the structure of lunar craters. Several\r\nvery notable cracks or chasms may be seen to the north of these two\r\ncraters. They are contorted in a very unusual and remarkable manner, the\r\nresult probably of the force which formed them having to encounter very\r\nvarying resistance near the surface.\r\n\r\nSome parts of these chasms gape to the width of two to three miles, and\r\nwhen closely scrutinized are seen to be here and there partly filled by\r\nmasses which have fallen inward from their sides. Several smaller\r\ncraters are scattered around, which, together with the great chasms and\r\nneighbouring ridges, give evidence of varied volcanic activity in this\r\nlocality. We must not omit to draw attention to the parallelism or\r\ngeneral similarity of “strike” in the ridges of extruded matter; this\r\nappearance has special interest in the eyes of geologists, and is well\r\nrepresented in our illustration.\r\n\r\nAristarchus is specially remarkable for the extraordinary capability\r\nwhich the material forming its interior and rampart banks has of\r\nreflecting light. Although there are many portions of the lunar surface\r\nwhich possess the same property, yet few so remarkably as in the case of\r\nAristarchus, which shines with such brightness, as compared with its\r\nimmediate surroundings, as to attract the attention of the most\r\nunpractized observer. Some have supposed this appearance to be due to\r\nactive volcanic discharge still lingering on the lunar surface, an idea\r\nin which, for reasons to be duly adduced, we have no faith. Copernicus,\r\nin the remarkable bright streaks which radiate from it, and Tycho also,\r\nas well as several other spots, are apparently composed of material very\r\nnearly as highly reflective as that of Aristarchus. But the comparative\r\nisolation of Aristarchus, as well as the extraordinary light-reflecting\r\nproperty of its material, renders it especially noticeable, so much so\r\nas to make it quite a conspicuous object when illuminated only by\r\nearth-light, when but a slender crescent of the lunar disc is\r\nilluminated, or when, as during a lunar eclipse, the disc of the moon is\r\nwithin the shadow of the earth, and is lighted only by the rays\r\nrefracted through the earth’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere are no features about Herodotus of any such speciality as to call\r\nfor remark, except it be the breach of the north side of its rampart by\r\nthe southern extremity of a very remarkable contorted crack or chasm,\r\nwhich to all appearance owes its existence to some great disruptive\r\naction subsequent to the formation of the crater.\r\n\r\n\r\n   WALTER, 48 (37·8—131·9), and adjacent Intrusive Craters. Plate XX.\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents a southern portion of the moon’s surface measuring\r\n170 by 230 miles. It includes upwards of 200 craters of all dimensions,\r\nfrom Walter, whose rampart measures nearly 70 miles across, down to\r\nthose of such small apparent diameter as to require a well practized eye\r\nto detect them. In the interior of the great crater Walter a remarkable\r\ngroup of small craters may be observed surrounding his central cone,\r\nwhich in this instance is not so perfectly in the centre of the rampart\r\nas is usually the case. The number of small craters which we have\r\nobserved within the rampart is 20, exclusive of those on the rampart\r\nitself. The entire group represented in the Plate suggests in a striking\r\nmanner the wild scenery which must characterize many portions of the\r\nlunar surface; the more so if we keep in mind the vast proportions of\r\nthe objects which they comprise, upon which point we may remark that the\r\nsmallest crater represented in this Plate is considerably larger than\r\nthat of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ARCHIMEDES, 191 (40·3—95·8), AUTOLYCUS, 189 (36·8—95·5), ARISTILLUS,\r\n             190 (37·0—93·3), and the APENNINES. Plate IX.\r\n\r\nThis group of three magnificent craters, together with their remarkable\r\nsurroundings, especially including the noble range of mountains termed\r\nthe Apennines, forms on the whole one of the most striking and\r\ninteresting portions of the lunar surface. If the reader is not\r\nacquainted with what the telescope can reveal as to the grandeur of the\r\neffect of sunrise on this very remarkable portion of the moon’s surface,\r\nhe should carefully inspect and study our illustration of it; and if he\r\nwill pay due regard to our previously repeated suggestion concerning the\r\nattached scale of miles, he will, should he have the good fortune to\r\nstudy the actual objects by the aid of a telescope, be well prepared to\r\nrealize and duly appreciate the magnificence of the scene which will be\r\npresented to his sight.\r\n\r\nWere we to attempt an adequate detail description of all the interesting\r\nfeatures comprised within our illustration, it would, of itself, fill a\r\ngoodly volume; as there is included within the space represented every\r\nvariety of feature which so interestingly characterizes the lunar\r\nsurface. All the more prominent details are types of their class; and\r\nare so favourably situated in respect to almost direct vision, as to\r\nrender their nature, forms, and altitudes above and depths below the\r\naverage surface of the moon most distinctly and impressively cognizable.\r\n\r\nArchimedes is the largest crater in the group; it has a diameter of\r\nupwards of 52 miles, measuring from summit to summit of its vast\r\ncircular rampart or crater wall, the average height of which, above the\r\nplateau, is about 4300 feet; but some parts of it rise considerably\r\nhigher, and, in consequence, cast steeple-like shadows across the\r\nplateau when the sun’s rays are intercepted by them at a low angle. The\r\nplateau of this grand crater is devoid of the usual central cone. Two\r\ncomparatively minute but beautifully-formed craters may be detected\r\nclose to the north-east interior side of the surrounding wall of the\r\ngreat crater. Both outside and inside of the crater wall may be seen\r\nmagnificent examples of the landslip subsidence of its overloaded banks;\r\nthese landslips form vast concentric segments of the outer and inner\r\ncircumference of the great circular rampart, and doubtless belong to its\r\nera of formation. Two very fine examples of cracks, or chasms, may be\r\nobserved proceeding from the opposite external sides of the crater, and\r\nextending upwards of 100 miles in each direction; these cracks, or\r\nchasms, are fully a mile wide at their commencement next the crater, and\r\nnarrow away to invisibility at their further extremity. Their course is\r\nconsiderably crooked, and in some parts they are partially filled by\r\nmasses of the material of their sides, which have fallen inward and\r\npartially choked them. The depths of these enormous chasms must be very\r\ngreat, as they probably owe their existence to some mighty upheaving\r\naction, which there is every reason to suppose originated at a profound\r\ndepth, since the general surface on each side of the crater does not\r\nappear to be disturbed as to altitude, which would have been the case\r\nhad the upheaving action been at a moderate depth beneath. We would\r\nventure to ascribe a depth of not less than ten miles as the most\r\nmoderate estimate of the profundity of these terrible chasms. If the\r\nreader would realize the scale of them, let him for a moment imagine\r\nhimself a traveller on the surface of the moon coming upon one of them,\r\nand finding his onward progress arrested by the sudden appearance of its\r\nvast black yawning depths; for by reason of the angle of his vision\r\nbeing almost parallel to the surface, no appearance of so profound a\r\nchasm would break upon his sight until he came comparatively close to\r\nits fearful edge. Our imaginary lunar traveller would have to make a\r\nvery long détour, ere he circumvented this terrible interruption to his\r\nprogress. If the reader will only endeavour to realize in his mind’s eye\r\nthe terrific grandeur of a chasm a mile wide and of such dark profundity\r\nas to be, to all appearance, fathomless—portions of its rugged sides\r\nfallen in wild confusion into the jaws of the tortuous abyss, and\r\ncatching here and there a ray of the sun sufficient only to render the\r\ndarkness of the chasm more impressive as to its profundity—he will, by\r\nso doing, learn to appreciate the romantic grandeur of this, one of the\r\nmany features which the study of the lunar surface presents to the\r\ncareful observer, and which exceed in sublimity the wildest efforts of\r\npoetic and romantic imagination. The contemplation of these views of the\r\nlunar world are, moreover, vastly enhanced by special circumstances\r\nwhich add greatly to the impressiveness of lunar scenery, such as the\r\nunchanging pitchy-black aspect of the heavens and the death-like silence\r\nwhich reigns unbroken there.\r\n\r\nThese digressions are, in some respects, a forestallment of what we have\r\nto say by-and-by, and so far they are out of place; but with the\r\nillustration to which the above remarks refer placed before the reader,\r\nthey may, in some respects, enhance the interest of its examination.\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of our illustration is occupied by the magnificent\r\nrange of volcanic mountains named after our Apennines, extending to a\r\nlength of upwards of 450 miles. This mountain group rises gradually from\r\na comparatively level surface towards the south-west, in the form of\r\ninnumerable comparatively small mountains of exudation, which increase\r\nin number and altitude towards the north-east, where they culminate and\r\nsuddenly terminate in a sublime range of peaks, whose altitude and\r\nrugged aspect must form one of the most terribly grand and romantic\r\nscenes which imagination can conceive. The north-east face of the range\r\nterminates abruptly in an almost vertical precipitous face, and over the\r\nplain beneath intense black steeple or spire-like shadows are cast, some\r\nof which at sunrise extend fully 90 miles, till they lose themselves in\r\nthe general shading due to the curvature of the lunar surface. Nothing\r\ncan exceed the sublimity of such a range of mountains, many of which\r\nrise to heights of 18,000 to 20,000 feet at one bound from the plane at\r\ntheir north-east base. The most favourable time to examine the details\r\nof this magnificent range is from about a day before first quarter to a\r\nday after, as it is then that the general structure of the range as well\r\nas the character of the contour of each member of the group can, from\r\nthe circumstances of illumination then obtaining, be most distinctly\r\ninferred.\r\n\r\nSeveral comparatively small perfectly-formed craters are seen\r\ninterspersed among the mountains, giving evidence of the truly volcanic\r\ncharacter of the surrounding region, which, as before said, comprises in\r\na comparatively limited space the most perfect and striking examples of\r\nnearly every class of lunar volcanic phenomena.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured on Plate XXIII. to give some idea of a landscape\r\nview of a small portion of this mountain range.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n    TERRESTRIAL AND LUNAR VOLCANIC AREAS COMPARED.\r\n    PORTION OF THE MOON’S SURFACE.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VESUVIUS AND NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NAPLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                           ON LUNAR CRATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we stated in our brief general description of the visible hemisphere\r\nof the moon, and as a cursory glance at our map and plates will have\r\nshown, the predominant features of the lunar surface are the circular or\r\namphitheatrical formations that, by their number, and from their almost\r\nunnatural uniformity of design, induced the belief among early observers\r\nthat they must have been of artificial origin. In proceeding now to\r\nexamine the details of our subject with more minuteness than before,\r\nthese annular formations claim the first share of our attention.\r\n\r\nBy general acceptation the term “crater” has been used to represent\r\nnearly all the circular hollows that we observe upon the moon; and\r\nwithout doubt the word in its literal sense, as indicating a _cup_ or\r\ncircular cavity, is so far aptly applied. But among geologists it has\r\nbeen employed in a more special sense to define the hollowing out that\r\nis found at the summit of some extinct, and the majority of active,\r\nvolcanoes. In this special sense it may be used by the student of the\r\nlunar surface, though in some, and indeed in the majority of cases, the\r\nlunar crater differs materially in its form with respect to its\r\nsurroundings from those on the earth; for while, as we have said, the\r\nterrestrial crater is generally a hollow on a mountain top with its flat\r\nbottom high above the level of the surrounding country, those upon the\r\nmoon have their lowest points depressed more or less deeply below the\r\ngeneral surface of the moon, the external height being frequently only a\r\nhalf or one-third of the internal depth. Yet are the lunar craters truly\r\nvolcanic; as Sir John Herschel has said, they offer the true volcanic\r\ncharacter _in its highest perfection_. We have upon the earth some few\r\ninstances in which the geological conditions which have determined the\r\nsurface-formation have been identical with those that have obtained upon\r\nthe moon; and as a result we have some terrestrial volcanic districts\r\nthat, could we view them under the same circumstances, would be\r\nidentical in character with what we see by telescopic aid upon our\r\nsatellite. The most remarkable case of this similarity is offered by a\r\ncertain tract of the volcanic area about Naples, known from classic\r\ntimes as the _Campi Phlegræi_, or burning fields, a name given to them\r\nin early days, either because they showed traces of ancient earth-fire,\r\nor because there were attached to the localities traditions concerning\r\nhot-springs and sulphurous exhalations, if not of actual fiery\r\neruptions. The resemblance of which we are speaking is here so close\r\nthat Professor Phillips, in his work on Vesuvius, which by the way\r\ncontains a historical description of the district in question, calls the\r\nmoon a grand Phlegreian field. How closely the ancient craters of this\r\nfamous spot resemble the generality of those upon the moon may be judged\r\nfrom Plate VI., in which representations of two areas, terrestrial and\r\nlunar, of the same extent, are exhibited side by side, the terrestrial\r\nregion being the volcanic neighbourhood of Naples, and the lunar a\r\nportion of the surface about the crater Theophilus.\r\n\r\nIn comparing these volcanic circles together, we are however brought\r\nface to face with a striking difference that exists between the lunar\r\nand terrestrial craters. This is the difference of magnitude. None of\r\nthose Plutonian amphitheatres included in the terrestrial area depicted\r\nexceed a mile in diameter, and few larger volcanic vents than these are\r\nknown upon the earth. Yet when we turn to the moon, and measure some of\r\nthe larger craters there, we are astonished to find them ranging from an\r\nalmost invisible minuteness to 74 miles in diameter. The same\r\ndisproportion exists between the depths of the two classes of craters.\r\nTo give an idea of relative dimensions, we would refer to our\r\nillustration of Copernicus[8] and its hundreds of comparatively minute\r\nsurrounding craters. Our terrestrial Vesuvius would be represented by\r\none of these last, which upon the plate measures about the twentieth of\r\nan inch in diameter! And this disproportion strikes us the more forcibly\r\nwhen we consider that the lunar globe has an area only one-thirteenth of\r\nthat of the earth. In view of this great apparent discrepancy it is not\r\nsurprising that many should have been incredulous as to the true\r\nvolcanic character of the lunar mountains, and have preferred to\r\ndesignate them by some “non-committal” term, as an American geologist\r\n(Professor Dana) has expressed it. But there is a feature in the\r\nmajority of the ring-mountains that, as we conceive, demonstrates\r\ncompletely the fact of volcanic force having been in full action, and\r\nthat seems to stamp the volcanic character upon the crater-forms. This\r\nspecial feature is the central cone, so well known as a characteristic\r\nof terrestrial volcanoes, accepted as the result of the last expiring\r\neffort of the eruptive force, and formed by the deposit, immediately\r\naround the volcanic orifice, of matter which there was not force enough\r\nto project to a greater distance. Upon the moon we have the central cone\r\nin small craters comparable to those on the earth, and we have it in\r\nprogressively larger examples, upon all scales, up to craters of 74\r\nmiles in diameter, as we have shown in Plate VII. Where, then, can we\r\ndraw the line? Where can we say the parallel action to that which placed\r\nVesuvius in or near the centre of the arc of Somma, or the cone figured\r\nin our sectional drawing of Vesuvius (Fig. 3) in the middle of its\r\npresent crater—where can we say that the action in question ceased to\r\nmanifest itself on the moon, seeing that there is no break in the\r\ncontinuity of the crater-and-cone system upon the moon anywhere between\r\ncraters of 1¾ miles and 74 miles in diameter? We have, it is true, many\r\nexamples of coneless craters, but these are of all sizes, down to the\r\nsmallest, and up to a largeness that _would_ almost seem to render\r\nuntenable the ejective explanation: of these we shall specially speak in\r\nturn, but for the present we will confine ourselves to the normal class\r\nof lunar craters, those that have central cones, and that are in all\r\nreasonable probability truly volcanic.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nAnd in the first place let us take a passing glance at the probable\r\nformative process of a terrestrial volcano. Rejecting the hypothesis of\r\nVon Buch, which geologists have on the whole found to be untenable, and\r\nwhich ascribes the formation of all mountains to the elevation of the\r\nearth’s crust by some thrusting power beneath, we are led to regard a\r\nvolcano as a pyramid of ejected matter, thrown out of and around an\r\norifice in the external solid shell of the earth by commotions\r\nengendered in its molten nucleus. What is the precise nature and source\r\nof the ejective force geologists have not perfectly agreed upon, but we\r\nmay conceive that highly expanded vapour, in all probability steam, is\r\nits primary cause. The escaping aperture may have been a weak place\r\nsince the foundations of the earth were laid, or it may have been formed\r\nby a local expansion of the nucleus in the act of cooling, upon the\r\nprinciple enunciated in our Third Chapter; or, again, the expansile\r\nvapour may have forced its own way through that point of the confining\r\nshell that offered it the least resistance. The vent once formed, the\r\nbuilding of the volcanic mountain commenced by the out-belching of the\r\nlava, ashes, and scoria, and the dispersion of these around the vent at\r\ndistances depending upon the energy with which they were projected. As\r\nthe action continued, the ejected matter would accumulate in the form of\r\na mound, through the centre of which communication would be maintained\r\nwith the source of the ejected materials and the seat of the explosive\r\nagency. The height to which the pile would rise must depend upon several\r\nconditions: upon the steady sustenance of the matter, and upon the form\r\nand weight of the component masses, which will determine the slope of\r\nthe mountain’s sides. Supposing the action to subside gradually, the\r\ntapering form will be continued upwards by the comparatively gentle\r\ndeposition of material around the orifice, and a perfect cone will\r\nresult of some such form as that represented below, which is the outline\r\nascribed by Professor Phillips to Vesuvius in pre-historic, or even\r\npre-traditional times, and which may be seen in its full integrity in\r\nthe cases of Etna, Teneriffe, Fussi-Yamma, the great volcanic mountain\r\nof Japan, and many others. The earliest recorded form of Vesuvius is\r\nthat of a truncated cone represented in Fig. 17, which shows its\r\ncondition, according to Strabo, in the century preceding the Christian\r\nEra.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE VII\r\n    DIAGRAM OF LUNAR CRATERS FORMING A SERIES RANGING FROM 1¾ MILES TO\r\n    78 MILES DIAMETER. ALL CONTAINING CENTRAL CONES.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nNow this form may have been assumed under two conditions. If, as\r\nPhillips has surmised, the mountain originally had a peaked summit with\r\nbut a small crater-orifice at the point, then we must ascribe its\r\ndecapitation to a subsequent eruption which in its violence carried away\r\nthe upper portion, either suddenly, or through a comparatively slow\r\nprocess of grinding away or widening out of the sides of the orifice by\r\nthe chafing or fluxing action of the out-going materials. But it is\r\nprobable that the mountain never had the perfect summit indicated in our\r\nfirst outline. The violent outburst that caused the great crater-opening\r\nof our second figure may have been but one paroxysmal phase of the\r\neruption that built the mountain: a sudden cessation of the eruptive\r\nforce when at its greatest intensity, and when the orifice was at its\r\nwidest, would leave matters in an opposite condition to that suggested\r\nas the result of a slow dying out of the action: instead of the peak we\r\nshould have a wide crater-mouth. It is of small consequence for our\r\npresent purpose whether the crater was contemporaneous with the\r\nprimitive formation of the mountain, or whether it was formed centuries\r\nafterwards by the blowing away of the mountain’s head; for upon the vast\r\nscale of geological time, intervals such as those between successive\r\nparoxysms of the same eruption, and those between successive eruptions,\r\nare scarcely to be discriminated, even though the first be days and the\r\nsecond centuries. We may remark that the widening of a crater by a\r\nsubsequent and probably more powerful eruption than that which\r\noriginally produced it is well established. We have only to glance at\r\nthe sketch, Fig. 18, of the outline of Vesuvius as it appeared between\r\nthe years A.D. 79 and 1631 to see how the old crater was enlarged by the\r\nterrible Pompeian eruption of the first-mentioned year. Here we have a\r\ncrater ground and blown away till its original diameter of a mile and\r\nthree-quarters has been increased to nearly three miles. Scrope had no\r\nhesitation in expressing his conviction that the external rings, such as\r\nthose of Santorin, St. Jago, St Helena, the Cirque of Teneriffe, the\r\nCurral of Madeira, the cliff range that surrounds the island of Bourbon,\r\nand others of similar form and structure, however wide the area they\r\nenclose, are truly the “basal wrecks” of volcanic mountains that have\r\nbeen blown into the air each by some eruption of peculiar paroxysmal\r\nviolence and persistence; and that the circular or elliptical basins\r\nwhich they wholly or in part surround are in all cases true craters of\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nWhen the violent outburst that produces a great crater in a volcanic\r\nmountain-top more or less completely subsides, the funnel or escaping\r\norifice becomes choked with débris. Still the vent strives to keep\r\nitself open, and now and then gives out a small delivery of cindery\r\nmatter, which, being piled around the vent, after the manner of its\r\ngreat prototype, forms the inner cone. This last may in its turn bear an\r\nopen crater upon its summit, and a still smaller cone may form within\r\n_it_. As the action further dies away, the molten lava, no longer\r\nseething and boiling, and spirting forth with the rest of the ejected\r\nmatter, wells upwards slowly, and cooling rapidly as it comes in contact\r\nwith the atmosphere, solidifies and forms a flat bottom or floor to the\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\nIt may happen that a subsequent eruption from the original vent will be\r\ncomparable in violence to the original one, and then the inner cone\r\nassumes a magnitude that renders it the principal feature of the\r\nmountain, and reduces the old crater to a secondary object. This has\r\nbeen the case with Vesuvius. During the eruption of 1631 the great cone\r\nwhich we now call Vesuvius was thrown up, and the ancient crater now\r\ndistinguished as Monte Somma became a subsidiary portion of the whole\r\nmountain. Then the appearance was that shown in Fig. 19, and which does\r\nnot differ greatly from that presented in the present day. The summit of\r\nthe Vesuvian cone, however, has been variously altered; it has been\r\nblown away, leaving a large crateral hollow, and it has rebuilt itself\r\nnearly upon its former model.\r\n\r\nWhen we transfer our attention to the volcanoes of the moon, we find\r\nourselves not quite so well favoured with means for studying the process\r\nof their formation; for the sight of the building up of a volcanic\r\nmountain such as man has been permitted to behold upon the earth has not\r\nbeen allowed to an observer of the moon. The volcanic activity,\r\nenfeebled though it now be, of which we are witnesses from time to time\r\non the earth, has altogether ceased upon our satellite, and left us only\r\nits effects as a clue to the means by which they were produced. If we in\r\nour time could have seen the actual throwing up of a lunar crater, our\r\ntask of description would have been simple; as it is we are compelled to\r\ninfer the constructive action from scrutiny of the finished structure.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely doubt that where a lunar crater bears general\r\nresemblance to a terrestrial crater, the process of formation has been\r\nnearly the same in the one case as in the other. Where variations\r\npresent themselves they may reasonably be ascribed to the difference of\r\nconditions pertaining to the two spheres. The greatest dissimilarity is\r\nin the point of dimensions; the projection of materials to 20 or more\r\nmiles distance from a volcanic vent appears almost incredible, until we\r\nrealize the full effect of the conditions which upon the moon are so\r\nfavourable to the dispersive action of an eruptive force. In the first\r\nplace, the force of gravity upon our satellite is only one-sixth of that\r\nto which bodies are subject upon the earth. Secondly, by reason of the\r\nsmall magnitude of the moon and its proportionally much larger surface\r\nin ratio to its magnitude, the rate at which it parted with its cosmical\r\nheat must have been much more rapid than in the case of the earth,\r\nespecially when enhanced by the absence of the heat-conserving power of\r\nan atmosphere of air or water vapour; and the disruptive and eruptive\r\naction and energy may be assumed to be greater in proportion to the more\r\nrapid rate of cooling; operating, too, as eruptive action would on\r\nmatter so much reduced in weight as it is on the surface of the moon, we\r\nthus find in combination conditions most favourable to the display of\r\nvolcanic action in the highest degree of violence. Moreover, as the\r\nejected material in its passage from the centre of discharge had not to\r\nencounter any atmospheric resistance, it was left free to continue the\r\nprimary impulse of its ejection without other than gravitative\r\ndiminution, and thus to deposit itself at distances from its source\r\nvastly greater than those of which we have examples on the earth.\r\n\r\nWe can of course only conjecture the source or nature of the moon’s\r\nvolcanic force. If geologists have had difficulty in assigning an origin\r\nto the power that threw up our earthly volcanoes, into whose craters\r\nthey can penetrate, whose processes they can watch, and whose material\r\nthey can analyze, how vastly more difficult must be the inquiry into the\r\nprimary source of the power that has been at work upon the moon, which\r\ncannot be virtually approached by the eye within a distance of six or\r\neight hundred miles, and the material of which we cannot handle to see\r\nif it be compacted by heat, or distended by vapours. Steam is the agent\r\nto which geologists have been accustomed to look for explanation of\r\nterrestrial volcanoes; the contact of water with the molten nucleus of\r\nour globe is accepted as a probable means whereby volcanic commotions\r\nare set up and ejective action is generated. But we are debarred from\r\nreferring to steam as an element of lunar geology, by reason of the\r\nabsence of water from the lunar globe. We might suppose that a small\r\nproportion of water once existed; but a small proportion would not\r\naccount for the immense display of volcanic action which the whole\r\nsurface exhibits. If we admitted a Neptunian origin to the disturbances\r\nof the moon’s crust, we should be compelled to suppose that water had\r\nexisted nearly in as great quantity, area for area, there as upon our\r\nglobe; but this we cannot reasonably do.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n    COPERNICUS.]\r\n\r\nAqueous vapour being denied us, we must look in other directions for an\r\nejective force. Of the nature of the lunar materials we can know\r\nnothing, and we might therefore assume anything; some have had recourse\r\nto the supposition of expansive vapours given off by some volatile\r\ncomponent of the said material while in a state of fusion, or generated\r\nby chemical combinations. Professor Dana refers to sulphur as probably\r\nan important element in the moon’s geology, suggesting this substance\r\nbecause of the part which it appears to play in the volcanic or igneous\r\noperations of our globe, and on account of its presence in cosmical\r\nmeteors that have come within range of our analysis. Any matter\r\nsublimated by heat in the substrata of the moon would be condensed upon\r\nreaching the cold surrounding space, and would be deposited in a state\r\nof fine powder, or otherwise in a solid form. Maedler has attributed the\r\nhighly reflective portions of some parts of the surface, such as the\r\nbright streams that radiate from some of the craters, Copernicus and\r\nTycho for instance, to the vitrification of the surface matter by\r\ngaseous currents. But in suppositions like these we must remember that\r\nthe probability of truth diminishes as the free ground for speculation\r\nwidens. It does not appear clear how expansive vapours could have lain\r\ndormant till the moon assumed a solid crust, as all such would doubtless\r\nmake their escape before any shell was formed, and at an epoch when\r\nthere was ample facility for their expansion.\r\n\r\nWhile we are not insensible of the value of an expansive vapour\r\nexplanation, if it could be based on anything beyond mere conjecture, we\r\nare disposed to attach greater weight to that afforded by the principle\r\nsketched in our third chapter, viz., of expansion upon solidification.\r\nWe gave, as we think, ample proof that molten matter of volcanic nature,\r\nwhen about passing to the solid state, increases its bulk to a\r\nconsiderable degree, and we suggested that the lunar globe at one period\r\nof its history must have been, what our earth is now, a solid shell\r\nencompassing a molten nucleus; and further, that this last, in\r\napproaching its solid condition, expanded and burst open or rent its\r\nconfining crust. At first sight it may seem that we are ascribing too\r\ngreat a degree of energy to the expansive force which molten substances\r\nexhibit in passing to the solid condition, seeing that in general such\r\nforces are slow and gradual in their action; but this anomaly disappears\r\nwhen we consider the vast bulk of the so expanding matter, and the\r\ncomparatively small amount that in its expansion it had to displace. It\r\nis true that there are individual mountains on the moon covering many\r\nsquare miles of surface, that as much as a thousand cubic miles of\r\nmaterial may have been thrown up at a single eruption; but what is this\r\ncompared to the entire bulk of the moon itself? A grain of mustard-seed\r\nupon a globe three feet in diameter represents the scale of the loftiest\r\nof terrestrial mountains; a similar grain upon a globe one foot in\r\ndiameter, would indicate the proportion of the largest upon the moon. A\r\nmodel of our satellite with the elevations to scale would show nothing\r\nmore than a little roughness, or superficial blistering. Turn for a\r\nmoment to our map (Plate IV.), upon which the shadows give information\r\nas to the heights of the various irregularities, and suppose it to\r\nrepresent the actual size of some sphere whose surface has been broken\r\nup by reactions of some kind of the interior upon the exterior—suppose\r\nit to have been a globe of fragile material filled with some viscous\r\nsubstance, and that this has expanded, cracked its shell, oozed out in\r\nthe process of solidification, and solidified: the irregularity of\r\nsurface which the small sphere, roughened by the out-leaking matter,\r\nwould present, would not be less than that exhibited in the map under\r\nnotice. When we say that a lunar crater has a diameter of 30 miles, we\r\nraise astonishment that such a structure could result from an eruption\r\nby the expansive force of solidifying matter; but when we reflect that\r\nthis diameter is less than the two-hundredth part of the circumference\r\nof the moon, we need have no difficulty in regarding the upheaval as the\r\nresult of a force slight in comparison to the bulk of the material\r\ngiving rise to it. We have upon the moon evidence of volcanic eruptions\r\nbeing the final result of most extensive dislocations of surface, such\r\nas could only be produced by some widely diffused uplifting force. We\r\nallude to the frequent occurrence of chains of craters lying in a nearly\r\nstraight line, and of craters situated at the converging point of\r\nvisible lines of surface disturbance. Our map will exhibit many examples\r\nof both cases. An examination of the upper portion (the southern\r\nhemisphere of the moon) will reveal abundant instances of the linear\r\narrangement, three, four, five or even more crateral circles will be\r\nfound to lie with their centres upon the same great-circle track,\r\nproving almost undoubtedly a connexion between them so far as the\r\noriginal disturbing force which produced them is concerned. Again, in\r\nthe craters Tycho (30), Copernicus (147), Kepler (146), and Proclus\r\n(162), we see instances of the situation of a volcanic outburst at an\r\nobvious focus of disturbance. These manifest an up-thrusting force\r\ncovering a large sub-surface area, and escaping at the point of least\r\nresistance. Such an extent of action almost precludes the gaseous\r\nexplanation, but it is compatible with the expansion on consolidation\r\ntheory, since it is reasonable to suppose that in the process of\r\nconsolidation the viscous nucleus would manifest its increase of bulk\r\nover considerable areas, disturbing the superimposed crust either in one\r\nlong crack, out of the wider opening parts of which the expanded\r\nmaterial would find its escape, or “starring” it with numerous cracks,\r\nfrom the converging point of which the confined matter would be ejected\r\nin greatest abundance and, if ejected there with great energy and\r\nviolence, would result in the formation of a volcanic crater.\r\n\r\nThe actual process by which a lunar crater would be formed would differ\r\nfrom that pertaining to a terrestrial crater only to the extent of the\r\ndifferent conditions of the two globes. We can scarcely accept Scrope’s\r\nterm “basal wrecks” (of volcanic mountains that have had the summits\r\nblown away) as applicable to the craters of the moon, for the reason\r\nthat the lunar globe does not offer us any instance of a mountain\r\ncomparable in extent to the great craters and whose summit has _not_\r\nbeen blown away. Scrope’s definition implies a double, or divided\r\nprocess of formation: first the building up of a vast conical hill and\r\nthen the decapitation and “evisceration” of it at some later period.\r\nThere are grounds for this inferred double action among the terrestrial\r\nvolcanoes, since both the perfect cone and its summitless counterpart\r\nare numerously exemplified. But upon the moon we have no perfect cone of\r\ngreat size, we have no exception whereby the rule can be proved. It is\r\nagainst probability, supposing every lunar crater to have once been a\r\nmountain, that in every case the mountain’s summit should have been\r\nblown away; and we are therefore compelled to consider that the moon’s\r\nvolcanic craters were formed by one continuous outburst, and that their\r\n“evisceration” was a part of the original formative process. We do not,\r\nhowever, include the central cone in this consideration: that may be\r\nreasonably ascribed to a secondary action or perhaps, better, to a\r\nweaker or modified phase of the original and only eruption.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n    THE LUNAR APENNINES, ARCHIMEDES &c., &c.]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances we conceive the upcasting and excavating of a\r\nnormal lunar crater to have been primarily caused by a local\r\nmanifestation of the force of expansion upon solidification of the\r\nsubsurface matter of the moon, resulting in the creation of a mere\r\n“star” or crack in and through the outermost and solid crust. As we\r\nshall have to rely upon diagrams to explain the more complicated\r\nfeatures, we give one of this elementary stage also as a commencement of\r\nthe series; and Fig. 20 therefore represents a probable section of the\r\nlunar surface at a point which was subsequently the location of a\r\ncrater. From the vent thus formed we conceive the pent-up matter to have\r\nfound its escape, not necessarily at a single outburst, but in all\r\nprobability in a paroxysmal manner, as volcanic action manifests itself\r\non our globe. The first outflow of molten material would probably\r\nproduce no more than a mere hill or tumescence as shewn sectionally in\r\nFig. 21; and if the ejective force were small this might increase to the\r\nmagnitude of a mountain by an exudative process to be alluded to\r\nhereafter. But if the ejective force were violent, either at the moment\r\nof the first outburst or at any subsequent paroxysm, an action\r\nrepresented in Fig. 22 would result: the unsupported edges or lips of\r\nthe vent-hole would be blown and ground or fluxed away, and a\r\nfunnel-formed cavity would be produced, the ejected matter (so much of\r\nit as in falling was not caught by the funnel) being deposited around\r\nthe hollow and forming an embryo circular mountain. The continuance of\r\nthis action would be accompanied by an enlargement of the conical cavity\r\nor crater, not only by the outward rush of the violently discharged\r\nmaterial, but also by the “sweating” or grinding action of such of it as\r\nin descending fell within the hollow. And at the same time that the\r\ncrater enlarged the rampart would extend its circumference, for it would\r\nbe formed of such material as did not fall back again into the crater.\r\nUpon this view of the crater-forming process we base the sketch, Fig.\r\n23, of the probable section of a lunar crater at one period of its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\nSo long as each succeeding paroxysm was greater than its predecessor,\r\nthis excavating of the hollow and widening of its mouth and mound would\r\nbe extended. But when a weaker outburst came, or when the energy of the\r\nlast eruption died away, a process of slow piling up of matter close\r\naround the vent would ensue. It is obvious that when the ejective force\r\ncould no longer exert itself to a great distance it must merely have\r\nlifted its burden to the relieving vent and dropped it in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. Even if the force were considerable, the effect, so long\r\nas it was insufficient to throw the ejecta beyond the rim of the crater,\r\nwould be to pile material in the lowermost part of the cavity; for what\r\nwas not cast over the edge would roll or flow down the inner slope and\r\naccumulate at the bottom. And as the eruption died away, it would add\r\nlittle by little to the heap, each expiring effort leaving the out-given\r\nmatter nearer the orifice, and thus building up the central cone that is\r\nso conspicuous a feature in terrestrial volcanoes, and which is also a\r\nmarked one in a very large proportion of the craters of the moon. This\r\nformation of the cone is pictorially described by Fig. 24.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\nIn the volcanoes of the earth we observe another action either\r\nconcurrent with or immediately subsequent to the erection or formation\r\nof the cone: this is the outflow or the welling forth of fluid lava,\r\nwhich in cooling forms the well-known plateau. We have this feature\r\ncopiously represented upon the moon and it is presumable that it has in\r\ngeneral been produced in a manner analogous to its counterparts upon the\r\nearth. We may conceive that the fluid matter was either spirted forth\r\nwith the solid or semisolid constituents of the cone, in which case it\r\nwould drain down and fill the bottom of the crater; or we may suppose\r\nthat it issued from the summit of the cone and ran down its sides, or\r\nthat, as we see upon the earth, it found its escape before reaching the\r\napex, by forcing its way through the basal parts. These actions are\r\nindicated hypothetically for the moon in Fig. 25; and the parallel\r\nphenomena for the earth are shewn by the actual case (represented in\r\nFig. 26 and on Plate I.) of Vesuvius as it was seen by one of the\r\nauthors in 1865, when the principal cone was vomiting forth ashes,\r\nstones, and red-hot lava, while a vent at the side emitted very fluid\r\nlava which was settling down and forming the plateau.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot, obviously, see upon the moon evidence of a cone\r\nactually overtopped by the rising lake of lava, yet it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose that such a condition of things actually\r\noccurred in many of those instances in which we observe craters without\r\ncentral cones, but with plateaux so smooth as to indicate previous\r\nfluidity or viscosity. From the state of things exhibited in Fig. 25 the\r\ntransition to that shewn in Fig. 27 is easily, and to our view\r\nreasonably, conceivable. We are in a manner led up to this idea by a\r\nreview of the various heights of central cones above their surrounding\r\nplateaux. For instance, in such examples as Tycho or Theophilus, we have\r\ncones high above the lava floor; in Copernicus, Arzachael and Alphonsus\r\nthey are comparatively lower; the lava in these and some other craters\r\ndoes not appear to have risen so high; while in Aristotle and Eudoxus\r\namong others, we have only traces of cones, and it is supposable that in\r\nthese cases the lava rose so high as nearly to overtop the central\r\ncones. Why should it not have risen so far as to overtop and therefore\r\nconceal some cones entirely? We offer this as at least a feasible\r\nexplanation of some coneless craters: it is not necessary to suppose\r\nthat it applies to all such, however: there may have been many craters,\r\nthe formation of which ceased so abruptly that no cone was produced,\r\nthough the welling forth of lava occurred from the vent, which may have\r\nbeen left fully open, as in Fig. 28, or so far choked as to stay the\r\negress of solid ejecta and yet allow the fluid material to ooze upwards\r\nthrough it, and so form a lake of molten lava which on consolidation\r\nbecame the plateau. As most of the examples of coneless craters exhibit\r\non careful examination minute craters on the surface of the otherwise\r\nsmooth plateaux, we may suppose that such minute craters are evidences\r\nof the upflow of lava which resulted in the plateaux.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n    ARISTOTLE & EUDOXUS.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\nWe have strong evidence in support of this up-flow of lava offered by\r\nthe case of the crater Wargentin, (No. 26, 57·5—140·2) situated near the\r\nsouth-east border of the disc, and of which we give a special plate.\r\n(Plate XVII.) It appears to be really a crater in which the lava has\r\nrisen almost to the point of overflowing, for the plateau is nearly\r\nlevel with the edge of the rampart. This edge appears to have been\r\nhigher on one side than the other, for on the portion nearest the centre\r\nof the visible disc we may, under favourable circumstances, detect a\r\nsegment of the basin’s brim rising above the smooth plateau as indicated\r\nin our illustration. Upon the opposite side there is no such feature\r\nvisible, the plateau forms a sharp table-like edge. It is just possible\r\nthat an actual overflow of lava took place at this part of the crater,\r\nbut from the unfavourable situation of this remarkable object it is\r\nimpossible to decide the point by observation. There is no other crater\r\nupon the visible hemisphere of the moon that exhibits this filled-up\r\ncondition; but, unique as it is, it is sufficient to justify our\r\nconclusion that the plateau-forming action upon the moon has been a\r\nflowing-up of fluid matter from below subsequent to the formation of the\r\ncrater-rampart, and not, as a casual glance at the great smooth-bottom\r\ncraters might lead us to suspect, a result of some sort of diluvial\r\ndeposit which has filled hollows and cavities and so brought up an even\r\nsurface. The elevated basin of Wargentin could not have been filled thus\r\nwhile the surrounding craters with ramparts equally or less high\r\nremained empty: its contained matter must have been supplied from\r\nwithin, we must conjecture by the upflow of lava from the orifice which\r\ngave forth the material to form the crateral rampart in the first\r\ninstance. We are free to conjecture that at some period of this\r\ntable-mountain’s formation it was a crater with a central cone, and that\r\nthe rising lava over-topped this last feature in the manner shewn by the\r\nabove figure (Fig. 29).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe question occurs whether other craters may not have been similarly\r\nfilled and have emptied themselves by the bursting of the wall under the\r\npressure of the accumulated lake of lava within. We know that this\r\nbreaching is a common phenomenon in the volcanoes of our globe; the\r\ndistrict of Auvergne furnishing us with many examples; and there are\r\nsome suspicious instances upon the moon. Copernicus exhibits signs of\r\nsuch disruption, as also does the smaller crater intruding upon the\r\ngreat circle of Gassendi. (See Frontispiece.) But the existence of such\r\ndischarging breaches implies the outpouring of a body of fluid or\r\nsemi-fluid material, comparable in cubical content to the capacity of\r\nthe crater, and of this we ought to see traces or evidence in the form\r\nof a bulky or extensive lava stream issuing from the breach. But\r\nalthough there are faint indications of once viscous material lying in\r\nthe direction that escaping fluid would take, we do not find anything of\r\nthe extent that we should expect from the mass of matter that would\r\nconstitute _a craterfull_. It is true that if the escaping fluid had\r\nbeen very limpid it might have spread over a large area and have formed\r\na stratum too thin to be detected. Such a degree of limpidity as would\r\nbe required to fulfil this condition we are hardly, however, justified\r\nin assuming.\r\n\r\nTo return to the subject of central cones. Although there are cases in\r\nwhich the simple condition of a single cone exists, yet in the majority\r\nwe see that the cone-forming process has been divided or interrupted,\r\nthe consequence being the production of a group of conical hills instead\r\nof a single one. Copernicus offers an example of this character, six,\r\nsome observers say seven, separate points of light, indicating as many\r\npeaks tipped with sunshine, having been seen when the greater part of\r\nthe crater has been buried in shadow. Erastothenes, Bulialdus,\r\nMaurolicus, Petavius, Langreen, and Gassendi, are a few among many\r\ninstances of craters possessing more than a central single cone. This\r\nmultiplication of peaks upon the moon doubtless arose from similar\r\ncauses to those which produce the same feature in terrestrial volcanoes.\r\nOur sketch of Vesuvius in 1865 (Fig. 26) shows the double cone and the\r\nprobable source of the secondary one in the diverted channel of the\r\nout-coming material. A very slight interruption in the first instance\r\nwould suffice to divert the stream and form another centre of action, or\r\na choking of the original vent would compel the issuing matter to find a\r\nless resisting thoroughfare into open space, and the process of\r\ncone-building would be continued from the new orifice, perhaps to be\r\nagain interrupted after a time and again driven in another direction. In\r\nthis manner, by repeated arrests and diversions of the ejecta, cone has\r\ngrown upon the side of cone, till, ere the force has entirely spent\r\nitself, a cluster of peaks has been produced. It may have been that this\r\naction has taken place after the formation of the plateau, in the manner\r\nindicated by Fig. 30; a spasmodic outburst of comparatively slight\r\nviolence having sought relief from the original vent, and the flowing\r\nmatter, finding the one orifice not sufficiently open to let it pass,\r\nhaving forced other exit through the plateau.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n    TRIESNECKER.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\nIn frequent instances we observe the state of things represented in Fig.\r\n31, in which the plateau is studded with few or many small craters. This\r\nis the case with Plato, with Arzachael, Hipparchus, Clavius (which\r\ncontains about 15 small internal craters), and many others. It is\r\nprobable that these subsidiary craters were produced by an after-action\r\nlike that which has produced duplicated cones, but in which the\r\nsecondary eruption has been of somewhat violent character, for it may\r\nalmost be regarded as an axiom that violent eruptions excavate craters\r\nand weak ones pile up cones. In the cases referred to it seems\r\nreasonable to suppose that the main vent has been the channel for an\r\nup-cast of material, but that at some depth below the surface this\r\nmaterial met with some obstruction or cause of diversion, and that it\r\ntook a course which brought it out far away from the cone upon the floor\r\nof the plateau. It might even be carried so far as to be upon the\r\nrampart, and it is no uncommon thing to see small craters in such a\r\nsituation, though when they appear at such a distance from the primary\r\nvent, it seems more reasonable to suppose that they do not belong to it\r\nbut have arisen from a subsequent and an independent action.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nWe find scarcely an instance of a small crater occurring just in the\r\ncentre of a large one, or taking the place of the cone. This is a\r\ncurious circumstance. Whenever we have any central feature in a great\r\ncrater, that feature is a cone. The tendency of this fact is to prove\r\nthat cones were produced by very weak efforts of this expiring force,\r\nfor had there been any strength in the last paroxysm it is presumable\r\nthat it would have blown out and left a crater. No very violent\r\neruptions have therefore taken place from the vents that were connected\r\nwith the great craters of the moon, nothing more powerful than could\r\nproduce a cone of exudation or a cinder-heap. And with regard to cones,\r\nit is noteworthy that whether they be single or multiple, they never\r\nrise so high as the circular ramparts of their respective craters. This\r\nsupports the inferred connexion between the crater origin and the cone\r\norigin, for supposing the two to have been independent, a supposition\r\nuntenable in view of the universality of the central position of the\r\ncone, it is scarcely conceivable that the mountains should have always\r\nbeen located within ramparts higher than themselves. The less height\r\nargues less power in the upcasting agency, and the diminished force may\r\nwell be considered as that which would almost of necessity precede the\r\nexpiration of the eruption.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a crater is met with that has a double rampart, and the\r\nconcentricity suggests that there have been two eruptions from the same\r\nvent: one powerful, which formed the exterior circle, and a second\r\nrather less powerful which has formed the interior circle. It is not,\r\nhowever evident that this duplication of the ring has always been due to\r\na double eruption. In many cases there is duplication of only a portion:\r\na terrace exhibits itself around a part of the circular range, sometimes\r\nupon the outside and sometimes upon the inside. These terraces are not\r\nlikely to have been formed by any freak of the eruption, and we are led\r\nto ascribe them in general to landslip phenomena. When, in the course of\r\na volcano’s formation, the piling-up of material about the vent has\r\ncontinued till the lower portions have been unable to support the upper,\r\nor when from any cause, the material composing the pile has lost its\r\ncohesiveness, the natural consequence has been a breaking away of a\r\nportion of the structure and its precipitation down the inclined sides\r\nof the crater. Vast segments of many of the lunar mountain-rings appear\r\nto have been thus dislodged from their original sites and cast down the\r\nflanks to form crescent ranges of volcanic rocks either within or\r\nwithout the circle. Nearly every one of our plates contains craters\r\nexhibiting this feature in more or less extensive degree. Sometimes the\r\nseparated portion has been very small in proportion to the circumference\r\nof the crater: Plato is an instance in which a comparatively small mass\r\nhas been detached. In other cases very large segments have slid down and\r\nlie in segmental masses on the plateaux or form terraces around the\r\nrampart. Aristarchus, Treisnecker and Copernicus exhibit this larger\r\nextent of dislocation.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that these landslips occurred long after the formation of\r\nthe craters that have been subject to them. They are probably\r\nattributable to recent disintegration of the lunar rocks, and we have a\r\npowerful cause for this in the alternations of temperature to which the\r\nlunar crust is exposed. We shall have occasion to revert to this subject\r\nby-and-bye; at present it must suffice to point out that the extremes of\r\ncold and heat, between which the lunar soil varies, are, with reasonable\r\nprobability, assumed to be on the one hand the temperature of space\r\n(which is supposed to be about 200° below zero), and, on the other hand,\r\na degree of heat equal to about twice that of boiling water. A range of\r\nat least 500° must work great changes in such heterogeneous materials as\r\nwe may conjecture those of the lunar crust to be, by the alternate\r\ncontractions and expansions which it must engender, and which must tend\r\nto enlarge existing fissures and create new ones, to grind contiguous\r\nsurfaces and to dislodge unstable masses. This cause of change, it is to\r\nbe remarked, is one which is still exerting itself.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases we have an entirely opposite interruption of the\r\nuniformity of a crater’s contour. Instead of the breaking away of the\r\nring in segments we see the entire circuit marked with deep ruts that\r\nrun down the flanks in a radial direction, giving us evidence of a\r\ndownward _streaming_ of semi-fluid matter, instead of a disruption of\r\nsolid masses. We cannot doubt that these ruts have been formed by lava\r\ncurrents, and they indicate a condition of ejected material different\r\nfrom that which existed in the cases where the landslip character is\r\nfound. In these last the ejecta appears to have been in the form of\r\nmasses of solidified or rapidly solidifying matter, which remained where\r\ndeposited for a time and then gave way from overloading or loss of\r\ncohesiveness, whereas the substances thrown out in the case of the\r\nrutted banks were probably mixed solid and fluid, the former remaining\r\nupon the flanks while the latter trickled away. Nothing so well\r\nrepresents, upon a small scale, this radial channelling as a heap of\r\nwetted sand left for a while for the water to drain off from it. The\r\nsolid grains in such a heap sustain its general mass-form, but the\r\nliquid in passing away cuts the surface into fissures running from the\r\nsummit to the base, and forms it into a model of a volcanic mountain\r\nwith every feature of peak, crag, and chasm reproduced, This similarity\r\nof effect leads us to suspect a parallelism of cause, and thus to the\r\ninference that the material which originally formed such a\r\ncrater-mountain as Aristillus (which is a most prominent example of this\r\nrutted character, and appears in Plate IX., side by side with a crater\r\nthat has its banks segmentally broken), must have been of the compound\r\nnature indicated; and that an action analogous to that which ruts a damp\r\nsand-heap, rutted also the banks of the lunar crater.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n    THEOPHILUS CYRILLUS & CATHARINA.\r\n    SUNSET ASPECT.]\r\n\r\nBefore passing from the subject of craters it behoves us to say a few\r\nwords upon the curious manner in which these formations are complicated\r\nby intermingling and superposition. Yet, upon this point, we may be\r\nbrief, for in the way of description our plates speak more forcibly than\r\nis possible by words. In particular we would refer to Plate XII., which\r\nrepresents the conspicuous group of craters of which the three largest\r\nmembers have been respectively named Theophilus, Cyrillus, and\r\nCatherina. But the area included in this plate is by no means an\r\nextraordinary one; there are regions about Tycho wherein the craters so\r\ncrowd and elbow each other that, in their intricate combinations, they\r\nalmost defy accurate depiction. Our map and Plate XVI. will serve to\r\ngive some idea of them. This intermingling of craters obviously shows\r\nthat all the lunar volcanoes were not simultaneously produced, but that\r\nafter one had been formed, an eruption occurred in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood and blew a portion of it away; or it may have been that\r\nthe same deep-seated vent at different times gave forth discharges of\r\nmaterial the courses of which were more or less diverted on their way to\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nWe have before alluded to the frequent occurrence of lines of craters\r\nupon the moon. In these lines the overlapping is frequently visible; it\r\nis seen in Plate XII. before referred to, where the ring mountains are\r\nlinked into a chain slightly curved, and upon the map, Plate IV., the\r\nnearly central craters Ptolemy and Alphonsus, the latter of which\r\noverlaps the former, are seen to form part of a line of craters marking\r\na connection of primary disturbance. An extensive crack suggests itself\r\nas a favourable cause for the production of this overlaying of craters,\r\nfor it would serve as a sort of “line of fire” from various points at\r\nwhich eruptions would burst forth, sometimes weak or far apart, when the\r\nresult would be lines of isolated craters, and sometimes near together,\r\nor powerful, when the consequence would be the intrusion of one upon the\r\nother, and the perfect production of the latest formed at the expense or\r\nto the detriment of those that had been formed previously. The linear\r\ngrouping of volcanoes upon the earth long ago struck observant minds.\r\nThe fable of the _Typhon_ lying under Sicily and the Phlegreian fields\r\nand disturbing the earth by its writhings, is a mythological attempt to\r\nexplain the particular case in that region.\r\n\r\nThe capricious manner in which these intrusions occur is very curious.\r\nVery commonly a small crater appears upon the very rampart of a greater\r\none, and a more diminutive one still will appear upon the rampart of the\r\nparasite. Stoeffler presents us with one example of this character,\r\nHipparchus with another, Maurolycus with a third, and these are but a\r\nfew cases of many. Here and there we observe several craters ranged in a\r\nline with their rims in one direction all perfect, and the whole\r\nappearing like a row of coins that have fallen from a heap. There is an\r\nexample near to Tycho which we reproduce in Plate XX. In this case one\r\nis led to conjecture that the ejective agency, after exerting itself in\r\none spot, travelled onward and renewed itself for a time; that it ceased\r\nafter forming crater number two, and again journeyed forward in the same\r\nline, recommencing action some miles further, and again subsiding; yet\r\nagain pushing forward and repeating its outburst, till it produced the\r\nfourth crater, when its power became expended. In each of these\r\nsuccessive eruptions the centre of discharge has been just outside the\r\ncrater last formed; and the close connexion of the members of the group,\r\ntogether with the fact of their nearly similar size, appears to indicate\r\na community of origin. For it seems feasible that as a general rule the\r\nsize of a crater may be taken as a measure of the depth of force that\r\ngave rise to the eruption producing it. This may not be true for\r\nparticular cases, but it will hold where a great number are collectively\r\nconsidered; for if we assume the existence of an average disturbing\r\nforce, it is apparently clear that it will manifest itself in disturbing\r\ngreater or less surface-areas in proportion as it acts from greater or\r\nless depths. Or, _mutatis mutandis_, if we assume an uniform depth for\r\nthe source of action, the greater or less surface disturbance will be a\r\nmeasure of greater or less eruptive intensity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable case of a vast number of craters, which,\r\nfrom their uniform dimensions, suggest the idea of community of\r\nsource-power or source-depth, is that offered by the region surrounding\r\nCopernicus, which, as will be seen by our plate of that object, is a\r\nvast Phlegreian field of diminutive craters. So countless are the minute\r\ncraters that a high magnifying power brings into view when atmospheric\r\ncircumstances are favourable, and so closely are they crowded together,\r\nthat the resulting appearance suggests the idea of froth, and we should\r\nbe disposed to christen this the “frothy region” of the moon, did not a\r\ndanger exist in the tendency to connect a name with a cause. The craters\r\nthat are here so abundant are doubtless the remains of true volcanoes\r\nanalogous to the parasitical cones that are to be found on several\r\nterrestrial mountains, and not such accidental formations as the\r\n_Hornitos_ described by Humboldt as abounding in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Mexican volcano, Jurillo, but which the traveller did not consider\r\nto be true cones of eruption.[9] Although upon our plate, and in\r\ncomparison with the great crater that is its chief feature, these\r\ncountless hollows appear so small as at first sight to appear\r\ninsignificant, we must remember that the minutest of them must be grand\r\nobjects, each probably equal in dimensions to Vesuvius. For since, as we\r\nhave shown in an early chapter, the smallest discernible telescopic\r\nobject must subtend an angle to our eye of about a second, and since\r\nthis angle extended to the moon represents a mile of its surface, it\r\nfollows that these tiny specks of shadow that besprinkle our picture,\r\nare in the reality craters of a mile diameter. This comparison may help\r\nthe conception of the stupendous magnitude of the moon’s volcanic\r\nfeatures; for it is a conception most difficult to realize. It is hard\r\nto bring the mind to grasp the fact that that hollow of Copernicus is\r\nfifty miles in diameter. We read of an army having encamped in the once\r\npeaceful crater of Vesuvius, and of one of the extinct volcanoes of the\r\n_Campi Phlegræi_ being used as a hunting preserve by an Italian king.\r\nThese facts give an idea of vastness to those who have not the good\r\nfortune to see the actual dimensions of a volcanic orifice themselves.\r\nBut it is almost impossible to conjure up a vision of what that\r\nfifty-mile crater would look like upon the moon itself; and for want of\r\na terrestrial object as a standard of comparison, our picture, and even\r\nthe telescopic view of the moon itself, fails to render the imagination\r\nany help. We may try to realize the vastness by considering that one of\r\nour average English counties could be contained within its ramparts, or\r\nby conceiving a mountainous amphitheatre whose opposite sides are as far\r\napart as the cathedrals of London and Canterbury, but even these\r\ncomparisons leave us unimpressed with the true majesty which the object\r\nwould present to a spectator upon the surface of our satellite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE FORMATION OF THE CENTRAL CONE. FINAL ACTION OF A\r\n    LUNAR VOLCANO.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XIII\r\n    ARZACHAEL, PTOLEMY, and the RAILWAY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n         ON THE GREAT RING-FORMATIONS NOT MANIFESTLY VOLCANIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our previous chapter we have given a reason for regarding as true\r\nvolcanic craters all those circular formations, of whatever size, that\r\nexhibit that distinctive feature _the central cone_. Between the\r\nsmallest crater with a cone that we can detect under the best telescopic\r\nconditions, namely, the companion to Hell, 1¾ mile diameter, and the\r\ngreat one called Petavius, 78 miles in diameter, we find no break in the\r\ncontinuity of the crater-cum-cone system that would justify us in saying\r\nthat on the one side the volcanic or eruptive cause ceased, and on the\r\nother side some other causative action began. But there are numerous\r\ncircular formations that surpass the magnitude of Petavius and its\r\npeers, but that have no central cone, and are, therefore, not so\r\nmanifestly volcanic as those which possess this feature. Our map will\r\nshow many striking examples of this class at a glance. We may in\r\nparticular refer _inter alia_ to Ptolemy near the centre of the moon, to\r\nGrimaldi (No. 125), Shickard (No. 28), Schiller (No. 24), and Clavius\r\n(No. 13), all of which exceed 100 miles in diameter. Even the great\r\n_Mare Crisium_, nearly 300 miles in diameter, appears to be a formation\r\nnot distinct from those which we have just named. These present little\r\nof the generic crater character in their appearance; and they have been\r\ndistinguished therefrom by the name of _Walled_ or _Ramparted Plains_.\r\nTheir actual origin is beyond our explanation, and in attempting to\r\naccount for them we must perforce allow considerable freedom to\r\nconjecture. They certainly, as Hooke suggested, present a “broken\r\nbubble”-like aspect; but one cannot reasonably imagine the existence of\r\nany form of mineral matter that would sustain itself in bubble form over\r\nareas of many hundreds of square miles. And if it were reasonable to\r\nsuppose the great rings to be the foundations of such vast volcanic\r\ndomes, we must conclude these to have broken when they could no longer\r\nsustain themselves, and in that case the surface beneath should be\r\nstrewed with _débris_, of which, however, we can find no trace.\r\nMoreover, we might fairly expect that some of the smaller domes would\r\nhave remained standing: we need hardly say that nothing of the kind\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe true circularity of these objects appears at first view a remarkable\r\nfeature. But it ceases to be so if we suppose them to have been produced\r\nby some very concentrated sublunar force of an upheaving nature, and if\r\nonly we admit the homogeneity of the moon’s crust. For if the crust be\r\nhomogeneous, then _any_ upheaving force, deeply seated beneath it, will\r\nexert itself _with equal effects at equal distances from the source_:\r\nthe lines of equal effect will obviously be radii of a sphere with the\r\nsource of the disturbance for its centre, and they will meet a surface\r\nover the source in a circle. This will be evident from Fig. 32, in which\r\na force is supposed to act at F below the surface s s s s. The matter\r\ncomposing s s being homogeneous, the action of F will be equal at equal\r\ndistances in all directions. The lines of equal force, F_ f_, F _f_,\r\nwill be of equal length, and they will form, so to speak, radii of a\r\nsphere of force. This sphere is cut by the plane at _s s s s_, and as\r\nthe intersection necessarily takes place everywhere at the extremity of\r\nthese radii, the figure of intersection is demonstrably a circle (shown\r\nin perspective as an ellipse in the figure). Thus we see that an intense\r\nbut extremely confined explosion, for instance, beneath the moon’s crust\r\nmust disturb a _circular_ area of its surface, if the intervening\r\nmaterial be homogeneous. If this be not homogeneous there would be,\r\nwhere it offered _less_ than the average resistance to the disturbance,\r\nan outward distortion of the circle; and an opposite interruption to\r\ncircularity if it offers _more_ than the average resistance. This\r\nassumed homogeneity may possibly be the explanation of the general\r\ncircularity of the lunar surface features, small and great.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\nWe confess to a difficulty in accounting for such a very local\r\ngeneration of a deep-seated force; and, granting its occurrence, we are\r\nunprepared with a satisfactory theory to explain the resultant effect of\r\nsuch a force in producing a raised ring at the limit of the circular\r\ndisturbance. We may indeed, suppose that a vast circular cake or conical\r\nfrustra would be temporarily upraised as in Fig. 33, and that upon its\r\nsubsidence a certain extrusion of subsurface matter would occur around\r\nthe line or zone of rupture as in Fig. 34. This supposition, however,\r\nimplies such a peculiarly cohesive condition of the matter of the\r\nuplifted cake, that it is doubtful whether it can be considered tenable.\r\nWe should expect any ordinary form of rocky matter subjected to such an\r\nupheaval to be fractured and distorted, especially when the original\r\ndisturbing force is greater in the centre than at the edge, as,\r\naccording to the above hypothesis, it would be; and in subsiding, the\r\nrocky plateau would thus retain some traces of its disturbance; but in\r\nthe circular areas upon the moon there is nothing to indicate that they\r\nhave been subjected to such dislocations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 35.

We give a slightly modified version\r\nof his sketch in Fig. 35, showing what would be the probable phenomena\r\nattending such an upheaval as regards the behaviour of the disturbed\r\nportion of the crust, and also that of the lava or semifluid matter\r\nbeneath: and, as will be seen by the sketch, a possible phase of the\r\nphenomena is the production of an elevated ridge or rampart at the\r\npoints of disruption _c c_; and where there is a ring of disruption, as\r\nby our hypothesis there would be, the ridge or rampart _c c_ would be a\r\ncircle. In this drawing we see the cracking and distortion to which the\r\nelevated area would be subjected, but of which, as previously remarked,\r\nthe circular areas of the moon present no trace of residual appearance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n    PLATO.]\r\n\r\nThose who have offered other explanations of these vast ring-formed\r\nmountain ranges, have been no more happy in their conjectures. M. Rozet,\r\nwho communicated a paper on selenology to the French Academy in 1846,\r\nput forth the following theory. He argued that during the formation of\r\nthe solid scoriaceous pelicules of the moon, circular or tourbillonic\r\nmovements were set up; and these, by throwing the scoria from the centre\r\nto the circumference, caused an accumulation thereof at the limit of the\r\ncirculation. He considered that this phenomenon continued during the\r\nwhole process of solidification, but that the amplitude of the whirlpool\r\ndiminished with the decreasing fluidity of the surface material.\r\nFurther, he suggested that when many vortices were formed, and the\r\ndistances of their centres, taken two and two, were less than the sums\r\nof their radii, there resulted closed spaces terminated by arcs of\r\ncircles; and when for any two centres the distance was greater than the\r\nsum of the radii of action, two separate and complete rings were formed.\r\nWe have only to remark on this, that we are at a loss to account for the\r\norigination of such vorticose movements, and M. Rozet is silent on the\r\npoint. If the great circles are to be referred to an original sea of\r\nmolten matter, it appears to us more feasible to consider that wherever\r\nwe see one of them there has been, at the centre of the ring, a great\r\noutflow of lava that has flooded the surrounding surface. Then, if from\r\nany cause, and it is not difficult to assign one, the outflow became\r\nintermittent, or spasmodic, or subject to sudden impulses, concentric\r\nwaves would be propagated over the pool and would throw up the scoria or\r\nthe solidifying lava in a circular bank at the limit of the fluid area.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis does not differ greatly from the _ebullition_ theory\r\nproposed by Professor Dana, the American geologist, to explain these\r\nformations. He considered that the lunar ring-mountains were formed by\r\nan action analogous to that which is exemplified on the earth in the\r\ncrater of Kilauea, in the Hawaiian islands. This crater is a large open\r\npit exceeding three miles in its longer diameter, and nearly a thousand\r\nfeet deep. It has clear bluff walls round a greater part of its circuit,\r\nwith an inner ledge or plain at their base, raised 340 feet above the\r\nbottom. This bottom is a plain of solid lavas, entirely open to day,\r\nwhich may be traversed with safety (we are quoting Professor Dana’s own\r\nstatement written in 1846, and therefore not correctly applying to the\r\npresent time): over it there are pools of boiling lava in active\r\nebullition, and one is more than a thousand feet in diameter. There are\r\nalso cones at times, from a few yards to two or three thousand feet in\r\ndiameter, and varying greatly in angle of inclination. The largest of\r\nthese cones have a circular pit or crater at the summit. The great pit\r\nitself is oblong, owing to its situation on a fissure, but the lakes\r\nupon its bottom are round, and in them, says Professor Dana, “the\r\ncircular or slightly elliptical form of the moon’s craters is\r\nexemplified to perfection.”\r\n\r\nNow Dana refers this great pit crater and its contained lava-lakes to\r\n“the fact that the action at Kilauea is simply _boiling_, owing to the\r\nextreme fluidity of the lavas. The gases or vapours which produce the\r\nstate of active ebullition escape freely in small bubbles, with little\r\ncommotion, like jets over boiling water; while at Vesuvius and other\r\nlike cones they collect in immense bubbles before they accumulate force\r\nenough to make their way through; and consequently the lavas in the\r\nlatter case are ejected with so much violence that they rise to a height\r\noften of many thousand feet and fall around in cinders. This action\r\nbuilds up the pointed mountain, while the simple boiling of Kilauea\r\nmakes no cinders and no cinder cones.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Dana continues, “If the fluidity of lavas, then, is sufficient\r\nfor this active ebullition, we may have boiling going on over an area of\r\nan indefinite extent; for the size of a boiling lake can have no limits\r\nexcept such as may arise from a deficiency of heat. The size of the\r\nlunar craters is therefore no mystery. Neither is their circular form\r\ndifficult of explanation; for a boiling pool necessarily, by its own\r\naction, extends itself circularly around its centre. The combination of\r\nmany circles, and the large sea-like areas are as readily\r\nunderstood.”[10]\r\n\r\nIn justice to Professor Dana it should be stated that he included in\r\nthis theory of formation all lunar craters, even those of small size and\r\npossessing central cones; and he put forth his views in opposition to\r\nthe eruptive theory which we have set forth, and which was briefly given\r\nto the world more than twenty-five years ago. As regards the smallest\r\ncraters with cones, we believe few geologists will refuse their\r\ncompliance with the supposition that they were formed as our\r\ncrater-bearing volcanoes were formed: and we have pointed out the\r\nlogical impossibility of assigning any limit of size beyond which the\r\neruptive action could not be said to hold good, so long as the central\r\ncone is present. But when we come to ring-mountains having no cones, and\r\nof such enormous size that we are compelled to hesitate in ascribing\r\nthem to ejective action, we are obliged to face the possibility of some\r\nother causation. And, failing an explanation of our own that satisfied\r\nus, we have alluded to the few hypotheses proffered by others, and of\r\nthese Professor Dana’s appears the most rational, since it is based upon\r\na parallel found on the earth. In citing it, however, we do necessarily\r\nnot endorse it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                       PEAKS AND MOUNTAIN RANGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lunar features next in order of conspicuity are the mountain ranges,\r\npeaks, and hill-chains, a class of eminences more in common with\r\nterrestrial formations than the craters and circular structures that\r\nhave engaged our notice in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nIn turning our attention to these features, we are at the outset struck\r\nwith the paucity on the lunar surface of extensive mountain systems as\r\ncompared with its richness in respect of crateral formations; and a\r\nfield of speculation is opened by the recognition of the remarkable\r\ncontrast which the moon thus presents to the earth, where mountain\r\nranges are the rule, and craters like the lunar ones are decidedly\r\nexceptional. Another conspicuous but inexplicable fact is that the most\r\nimportant ranges upon the moon occur in the northern half of the visible\r\nhemisphere, where the craters are fewest and the comparatively\r\nfeatureless districts termed “seas” are found. The finest range is that\r\nnamed after our Apennines and which is included in our illustrative\r\nPlate, No. IX. It extends for about 450 miles and has been estimated to\r\ncontain upwards of 3000 peaks, one of which—Mount Huyghens—attains the\r\naltitude of 18,000 feet. The Caucasus is another lunar range which\r\nappears like a diverted northward extension of the Apennines, and,\r\nalthough a far less imposing group than the last named, contains many\r\nlofty peaks, one of which approaches the altitude assigned to Mount\r\nHuyghens while several others range between 11,000 and 14,000 feet high.\r\nAnother considerable range is the Alps, situated between the Caucasus\r\nand the crater Plato, and reproduced on Plate XIV. It contains some 700\r\npeaked mountains and is remarkable for the immense valley, 80 miles long\r\nand about five broad, that cuts it with seemingly artificial\r\nstraightness; and that, were it not for the flatness of its bottom,\r\nmight set one speculating upon the probability of some extraneous body\r\nhaving rushed by the moon at an enormous velocity, gouging the surface\r\ntangentially at this point and cutting a channel through the impeding\r\nmass of mountains. There are other mountain ranges of less magnitude\r\nthan the foregoing; but those we have specified will suffice to\r\nillustrate our suggestions concerning this class of features.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n    MERCATOR & CAMPANUS.]\r\n\r\nWe remark, too, that there is a prevailing tendency of the ranges just\r\nmentioned to present their loftiest constituents in abrupt terminal\r\nlines, facing nearly the same direction, the reverse of that towards\r\nwhich they are carried by the moon’s rotation; and as they recede from\r\nthe high terminal line, the mountains gradually fall off in height, so\r\nthat in bulk the ranges present the “crag and tail” contour which\r\nindividual hills upon the earth so frequently exhibit.\r\n\r\nIsolated peaks are found in small numbers upon the moon; there are a few\r\nstriking examples of them nevertheless, and these are chiefly situated\r\nin the mountainous region just alluded to. Several are seen to the east\r\n(right hand) of the Alpine range depicted on Plate XIV. The best known\r\nof these is Pico, which rises abruptly from a generally smooth plain to\r\na height of 7000 feet. It may be recognized as the lower of the two long\r\nshadowing spots located almost centrally above the crater Plato in the\r\nillustration just mentioned. Above it, at an actual distance of 40\r\nmiles, there is another peak (unnamed) about 4000 feet high; and away to\r\nthe west, beyond the small crater joined by a hill-ridge to Plato, is a\r\nthird pyramidal mountain nearly as high as Pico.\r\n\r\nIt seems natural to regard the great mountain chains as agglomerations\r\nof those peaks of which we have isolated examples in Pico and its\r\ncompeers, and thus to consider that the formation of a mountain chain\r\nhas been a multiplication of the process that formed the single\r\npyramid-shaped eminences. At first thought it might appear that the\r\ngreat mountain ranges were produced by bodily upthrustings of the crust\r\nof the moon by some subsurface convulsions. But such an explanation\r\ncould hardly hold in relation to the isolated peaks, for it is\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to conceive that these abrupt mountains,\r\nalmost resembling a sugarloaf in steepness, could have been protruded en\r\nmasse through a smooth region of the crust. On the contrary it is quite\r\nconsistent with probability to suppose that they were built up by a slow\r\nprocess somewhat analogous to that to which we have ascribed the piling\r\nof the central cones of the great craters. We believe they may be\r\nregarded as true mountains of exudation, produced by the comparatively\r\ngentle oozing of lava from a small orifice and its solidification around\r\nit; the vent however remaining open and the summit or discharging\r\norifice continually rising with the growth of the mountain, as indicated\r\nin the annexed cut, Fig. 36. This process is well exemplified in the\r\ncase of a water fountain playing during a severe frost; the water as it\r\nfalls around the lips of the orifice freezes into a hillock of ice,\r\nthrough the centre of which, however, a vent for the fluid is preserved.\r\nAs the water trickles over the mound it is piled higher and higher by\r\naccumulating layers of ice, till at length a massive cone is formed\r\nwhose height will be determined by the force or “head” of the water.\r\nSubstitute lava for water and we have at once a formative process which\r\nmay very fairly be considered as that which has given rise to the\r\nisolated mountains of the moon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\nThere are upon the earth mountainous forms resembling the isolated peaks\r\nof the moon, and which have been explained by a similar theory to the\r\nabove. We reproduce a figure of one observed by Dana at Hawaii (Fig.\r\n37), and a sketch of another observed on the summit of the Volcano of\r\nBourbon, (Fig. 38); we also reproduce (Fig. 39) an ideal section of the\r\nlatter, given by Mr. Scrope, and showing the successive layers of lava\r\nwhich would be disposed by just such an action as that manifested in the\r\ncase of the freezing fountain; and we quote that author’s words in\r\nreference to this explanation of the formation of Etna and other\r\nvolcanic mountains. “On examining,” says Mr. Scrope,[11] “the structure\r\nof the mountain (Etna) we find its entire mass, so far as it is exposed\r\nto view by denudation or other causes (and one enormous cavity, the Val\r\nde Bove penetrates deeply into its very heart), to be composed of beds\r\nof lava-rock alternating more or less irregularly with layers of scoriæ,\r\nlapillo and ashes, almost precisely identical in mineral character, as\r\nwell as in general disposition, with those erupted by the volcano at\r\nknown dates within the historical period. Hence we are fully justified\r\nin believing the whole mountain to have been built up in the course of\r\nages in a similar manner by repeated intermittent eruptions. And the\r\nargument applies by the rules of analogy to all other volcanic\r\nmountains, though the history of their recent eruptions may not be so\r\nwell recorded, provided that their structure corresponds with, and can\r\nbe fairly explained by this mode of production. It is also further\r\napplicable, under the same reservation, to all mountains composed\r\nentirely, or for the most part, of volcanic rocks, even though they may\r\nnot have been in eruption within our time.”\r\n\r\nTo these illustrations furnished from Scrope’s work we add another,\r\ncopied from a photograph by Professor Piazzi Smyth, of a “blowing cone”\r\nat the base of Teneriffe (Fig. 40), which is but one of many that are to\r\nbe found on that mountain and which has been formed by a process similar\r\nto that we have been considering, but acting upon a comparatively small\r\nscale. Professor Smyth describes this cone as about 70 feet high and of\r\nparabolic figure, composed of hard lava and with an upper aperture still\r\nyawning, “whence the burning breath of fires beneath once issued in fury\r\nand with destruction.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XVI\r\n    TYCHO,\r\n    AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.]\r\n\r\nReverting now to the moon, we remark that, if the foregoing explanation\r\nof the isolated lunar peaks be tenable, it should hold equally for the\r\ngroups of them which we see in the lunar Apennines, Alps, Caucasus and\r\nother ranges of like character. There occur in some places intermediate\r\ngroups which link the one to the other. Just above the crater\r\nArchimedes, on Plate IX., for instance, we see several single peaks and\r\nsmall clumps of them leading by successive multiple-peak examples to\r\nwhat may be called chains of mountains like many that are included in\r\nthe contiguous Apennine system. And, in view of this connexion between\r\nthe single peaks and the mountain ranges formed of aggregations of such\r\npeaks, it seems to us reasonable to conclude that the latter were formed\r\nby the comparatively slow escape of lava through multitudinous openings\r\nin a weak part of the moon’s crust, rather than to suppose that the\r\ncrust itself has been bodily upheaved and retained in its disturbed\r\nposition. The high peaks that many mountains in such a chain exhibit\r\naccord better with the former than the latter explanation; for it is\r\ndifficult to imagine how such lofty eminences could be erected by an\r\nupheaval, and we must remember that the moon has none of the denuding\r\nelements which are at work upon the earth, weather-wearing its mountain\r\nforms into sharpness and steepness.[12]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 40.\r\n    SMALL VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN AT THE END OF A STREET AT TENERIFFE.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\nAnd we have ground for believing the mountain-forming process on the\r\nmoon to have been a comparatively gentle one, in the fact that the\r\nmountain systems appear in regions otherwise little disturbed, and where\r\ncraters, which have all the appearances of violent origin, are few and\r\nfar between. Evidently the mountain and crater-forming processes,\r\nalthough both due to extrusive action, were in some measure different,\r\nand it is reasonable to suppose that the difference was in degree of\r\nintensity; so that while a violent ejection of volcanic material would\r\ngive rise to a crater, a more gradual discharge would pile up a\r\nmountain. In this view craters are evidences of _eruptive_, and\r\nmountains of comparatively gentle _exudative_ action.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly speculate with any degree of safety upon the cause of this\r\nvarying intensity of volcanic discharge. We may ascribe it to variation\r\nof _depth_ of the initial disturbing force, or to suddenness of its\r\naction; or it may be that different degrees of fluidity of the lava have\r\nhad modifying effects; or on the other hand different qualities of the\r\ncrust-material; or yet again differences of period—the quieter\r\nextrusions having occurred at a time when the volcanic forces were dying\r\ndown. There is an alliance between lunar craters and mountains that goes\r\nfar to show that there has been no radical difference in their origins.\r\nFor instance, as we have previously pointed out, craters in some cases\r\nrun in linear groups, as if in those cases they had been formed along a\r\nline of disruption or of least resistance of the crust; and the mountain\r\nchains have a corresponding linear arrangement. Then we see craters and\r\nmountain chains disposed in what seem obviously the same arcs of\r\ndisturbance. Thus Copernicus (No. 147), Erastothenes (No. 168), and the\r\nApennines appear to belong to one continuous line of eruption; and it\r\nrequires no great stretch of imagination to suppose that the Caucasus,\r\nEudoxus (No. 208) and Aristotle (No. 209) form a continuation of the\r\nsame line. Then around the Mare Serenetatis we see mountainous ridges\r\nand craters alternating one with the other as though the exuding action\r\nthere, normally sufficient to produce the ridges, had at some points\r\nbecome forcible enough to produce a crater. Again, upon the very\r\nmountain ranges themselves, as for instance among the Apennines, we find\r\nsmall craters occurring. We see, too, that the great craters are in many\r\ncases surrounded by radiating systems of ridges which almost assume\r\nmountainous proportions, and which are doubtless exuded matter from\r\n“starred” cracks, the centres of which are occupied by the craters. The\r\nsame kind of ridges here and there occur apart from craters (see for\r\ninstance Plate XVIII., below Aristarchus and Herodotus) and sometimes\r\nthey occur in the neighbourhood of extensive cracks, to which they also\r\nseem allied. We must indeed regard a linear crack as the origin either\r\nof a ridge (if the exudation is slight) or of a mountain chain (if the\r\nexudation is more copious) or a string of craters (if the extrusion\r\nrises to eruptive violence). But the subject of cracks is important\r\nenough to be treated in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nWe alluded in Chap. III. to the phenomena of wrinkling or puckering as\r\nproductive of certain mountainous formations; and we pointed out the\r\nstriking similarity in character of configuration between a shrivelled\r\nskin and a terrestrial mountain region. We do not perceive upon the moon\r\nsuch a decided coincidence of appearances extending over any\r\nconsiderable portion of her surface; but there are numerous limited\r\nareas where we behold mountainous ridges which partake strongly of the\r\nwrinkle character; and in some cases it is difficult to decide whether\r\nthe puckering agency or the exudative agency just discussed has produced\r\nthe ridges. The district bordering upon Aristarchus and Herodotus, above\r\nreferred to, is of this doubtful character; and a similar district is\r\nthat contiguous to Triesnecker (Plate XI.) There are, however, abundant\r\nexamples of less prominent lines of elevation, which may, with more\r\nprobability, be ascribed to a veritable wrinkling or puckering action;\r\nthey are found over nearly the whole lunar surface, some of them\r\nstanding out in considerable relief, and some merely showing gentle\r\nlines of elevation, or giving the surface an undulating appearance. A\r\nclose examination of our picture-map (Plate IV.) will reveal very\r\nnumerous examples, especially in the south-east (right-hand-upper)\r\nquadrant. Some of these lines of tumescence are so slightly prominent\r\nthat we may suppose them to have been caused by the action indicated by\r\nFig. 6 (p. 28), while others, from their greater boldness, appear to\r\nindicate a formative action analogous to that represented by Fig. 9 (p.\r\n29).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: IDEAL SKETCH OF PICO AS IT WOULD PROBABLY APPEAR IF\r\n    SEEN BY A SPECTATOR LOCATED ON THE MOON.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n    WARGENTIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                     CRACKS AND RADIATING STREAKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto confined our attention to those reactions of the moon’s\r\nmolten interior upon its exterior which have been accompanied by\r\nconsiderable extrusions of sub-surface material in its molten or\r\nsemi-solid condition. We now pass to the consideration of some phenomena\r\nresulting in part from that reaction and in part from other effects of\r\ncooling, which have been accompanied by comparatively little ejection or\r\nupflow of molten matter, and in some cases by none at all. Of such the\r\nmost conspicuous examples are those bright streaks that are seen, under\r\ncertain conditions of illumination, to radiate in various directions\r\nfrom single craters, and some of the individual radial branches of which\r\nextend from four to seven hundred miles in a great arc on the moon’s\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThere are several prominent examples of these bright streak systems upon\r\nthe visible hemisphere of the moon; the focal craters of the most\r\nconspicuous are Tycho, Copernicus, Kepler, Aristarchus, Menelaus, and\r\nProclus. Generally these focal craters have ramparts and interiors\r\ndistinguished by the same peculiar bright or highly reflective material\r\nwhich shows itself with such remarkable brilliance, especially at full\r\nmoon: under other conditions of illumination they are not so strikingly\r\nvisible. At or nearly full moon the streaks are seen to traverse over\r\nplains, mountains, craters, and all asperities; holding their way\r\ntotally disregardful of every object that happens to lay in their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable bright streak system is that diverging from the\r\ngreat crater Tycho. The streaks that can be easily individualized in\r\nthis group number more than one hundred, while the courses of some of\r\nthem may be traced through upwards of six hundred miles from their\r\ncentre of divergence. Those around Copernicus, although less remarkable\r\nin regard to their extent than those diverging from Tycho, are\r\nnevertheless in many respects well deserving of careful examination:\r\nthey are so numerous as utterly to defy attempts to count them, while\r\ntheir intricate reticulation renders any endeavour to delineate their\r\narrangement equally hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these bright streaks are invariably found diverging from a\r\ncrater, impressively indicates a close relationship or community of\r\norigin between the two phenomena: they are obviously the result of one\r\nand the same causative action. It is no less clear that the actuating\r\ncause or prime agency must have been very deep-seated and of enormous\r\ndisruptive power to have operated over such vast areas as those through\r\nwhich many of the streaks extend. With a view to illustrate\r\nexperimentally what we conceive to have been the nature of this\r\nactuating cause, we have taken a glass globe and, having filled it with\r\nwater and hermetically sealed it, have plunged it into a warm bath: the\r\nenclosed water, expanding at a greater rate than the glass, exerts a\r\ndisruptive force on the interior surface of the latter, the consequence\r\nbeing that at the point of least resistance, the globe is rent by a vast\r\nnumber of cracks diverging in every direction from the focus of\r\ndisruption. The result is such a strikingly similar counterpart of the\r\ndiverging bright streak systems which we see proceeding from Tycho and\r\nthe other lunar craters before referred to, that it is impossible to\r\nresist the conclusion that the disruptive action which originated them\r\noperated in the same manner as in the case of our experimental\r\nillustration; the disruptive force in the case of the moon being that to\r\nwhich we have frequently referred as due to the expansion which precedes\r\nthe solidification of molten substances of volcanic character.\r\n\r\nOur illustration, Plate XIX., is a photograph from one of many glass\r\nglobes which we have cracked in the manner described: a careful\r\ncomparison between the arrangement of the divergent cracks represented\r\nin the photograph and those seen spreading from Tycho and other lunar\r\ncraters will, we trust, justify us in what we have stated as to the\r\nsimilarity of the causes which have produced such identical results.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figures will further illustrate our views upon the\r\ncausative origin of the bright streaks. The primary action rent the\r\nsolid crust of the moon and produced a system of radiating fissures\r\n(Fig. 42): these immediately afforded egress for the molten matter\r\nbeneath to make its appearance on the surface simultaneously along the\r\nentire course of every crack, and irrespective of all surface\r\ninequalities or irregularities whatever (Fig. 43). We conceive that the\r\nupflowing matter spread in both directions sideways and in this manner\r\nproduced streaks of very much greater width than the cracks or fissures\r\nup through which it made its way to the surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 42.\r\n    ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE RADIATING CRACKS WHICH PRECEDE THE FORMATION OF\r\n    THE BRIGHT STREAKS.]\r\n\r\nIn further elucidation of this part of our subject we may refer to a\r\nfamiliar but as we conceive cogent illustration of an analogous action\r\nin the behaviour of water beneath the ice of a frozen pond, which, on\r\nbeing fractured by some concentrated pressure, or by a blow, is well\r\nknown to “star” into radiating or diverging cracks, up through which the\r\nwater immediately issues, making its appearance on the surface of the\r\nice simultaneously along the entire course of every crack, and on\r\nreaching the surface, spreading on both sides to a width much exceeding\r\nthat of the crack itself.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 43.\r\n    ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE RADIATING BRIGHT STREAKS.]\r\n\r\nIf this familiar illustration be duly considered, we doubt not it will\r\nbe found to throw considerable light on the nature of those actions\r\nwhich have resulted in the bright streaks on the moon’s surface. Some\r\nhave attempted to explain the cause of these bright streaks by assigning\r\nthem to streams of lava, issuing from the crater at the centre of their\r\ndivergence and flowing over the surface, but we consider such an\r\nexplanation totally untenable, as any idea of lava, be it ever so fluid\r\nat its first issue from its source, flowing in streams of nearly equal\r\nwidth, through courses several hundred miles long, up hills, over\r\nmountains, and across plains, appears to us beyond all rational\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n    ARISTARCHUS & HERODOTUS.]\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to our explanation of the formation of these bright\r\nstreaks, that so far as our means of observation avail us, we fail to\r\ndetect any shadows from them or from such marginal edges as might be\r\nexpected to result from a sideway-spreading outflow of lava from the\r\ncracks which afforded it exit in the manner described. Were the edges of\r\nthese streaks terminated by cliff-like or craggy margins of such height\r\nas 30 or 40 feet, we might just be able at low angles of illumination\r\nand under the most favourable circumstances of vision, to detect some\r\nslight appearance of shadows; but so far as we are aware, no such\r\nshadows have been observed. We are led to suppose that the impossibility\r\nof detecting them is due not to their absence but to the height of the\r\nmargins being so moderate as not to cast any cognizable shadow, inasmuch\r\nas an abrupt craggy margin of 10 or 15 feet high would, under even the\r\nmost favourable circumstances, fail to render such visible to us.\r\nReference to our ideal section of one of these bright streaks (Fig. 45),\r\nwill show how thin their edges may be in relation to their spreading\r\nwidth.\r\n\r\nThe absence of cognizable shadows from the bright streaks has led some\r\nobservers to conclude that they have no elevation above the surface over\r\nwhich they traverse, and it has therefore been suggested that their\r\nexistence is due to possible vapours which may have issued through the\r\ncracks, and condensed in some sublimated or pulverulent form along their\r\ncourses, the condensed vapours in question forming a surface of high\r\nreflective properties. That metallic or mineral substances of some kinds\r\ndo deposit on condensation very white powders, or sublimates, we are\r\nquite ready to admit, and such explanation of the high luminosity of the\r\nbright streaks, and of the craters situated at the foci or centres of\r\ntheir divergence is by no means improbable, so far as concerns their\r\nmere brightness. But as we invariably find a crater occupying the centre\r\nof divergence, and such craters are possessed of all the characteristic\r\nfeatures and details which establish their true volcanic nature as the\r\nresults of energetic extrusions of lava and scoria, we cannot resist the\r\nconclusion that the material of the crater, and that of the bright\r\nstreaks diverging from it, are not only of a common origin, but are so\r\nfar identical that the only difference in the structure of the one as\r\ncompared with the other is due to the more copious egress of the\r\nextruded or erupted matter in the case of the crater, while the\r\nrestricted outflow or ejection of the matter up through the cracks would\r\ncause its dispersion to be so comparatively gentle as to flood the sides\r\nof the cracks and spread in a thin sheet more or less sideways\r\nsimultaneously along their courses. There are indeed evidences in the\r\nwider of the bright streaks of their being the result of the outflow of\r\nlava through _systems of cracks_ running parallel to each other, the\r\nconfluence of the lava issuing from which would naturally yield the\r\nappearance of one streak of great width. Some of those diverging from\r\nTycho are of this class; many other examples might be cited, among which\r\nwe may name the wide streaks proceeding from the crater Menelaus and\r\nalso those from Proclus. Some of these occupy widths upwards of 25\r\nmiles—amply sufficient to admit of many concurrent cracks with confluent\r\nlava outflows.\r\n\r\nWe are disposed to consider as related to the fore-mentioned radiating\r\nstreaks, the numerous, we may say the multitudinous, long and narrow\r\nchasms that have been sometimes called “canals” or “rills,” but which\r\nare so obviously _cracks_ or chasms, that it is desirable that this name\r\nshould be applied to them rather than one which may mislead by implying\r\nan aqueous theory of formation. These cracks, singly and in groups, are\r\nfound in great numbers in many parts of the moon’s surface. As a few of\r\nthe more conspicuous examples which our plates exhibit we may refer to\r\nthe remarkable group west of Treisnecker (Plate XI.), the principal\r\nmembers of which converge to or cross at a small crater, and thus point\r\nto a continuity of causation therewith analogous to the evident relation\r\nbetween the bright streaks and their focal craters. Less remarkable, but\r\nno less interesting, are those individual examples that appear in the\r\nregion north of (below) the Apennines (Plate IX.), and some of which by\r\ntheir parallelism of direction with the mountain-chain appear to point\r\nto a causative relation also. There is one long specimen, and several\r\nshorter in the immediate neighbourhood of Mercator and Campanus (Plate\r\nXV.); and another curious system of them, presenting suggestive\r\ncontortions, occurs in connection with the mountains Aristarchus and\r\nHerodotus (Plate XVIII.). Others, again, appear to be identified with\r\nthe radial excrescences about Copernicus (Plate VIII.). Capuanus,\r\nAgrippa, and Gassendi, among other craters, have more or less notable\r\ncracks in their vicinities.\r\n\r\nSome of these chasms are conspicuous enough to be seen with moderate\r\ntelescopic means, and from this maximum degree of visibility there are\r\nall grades downwards to those that require the highest optical powers\r\nand the best circumstances for their detection. The earlier\r\nselenographers detected but a few of them. Schroeter noted only 11;\r\nLohrman recorded 75 more; Beer and Maedler added 55 to the list, while\r\nSchmidt of Athens raised the known number to 425, of which he has\r\npublished a descriptive catalogue. We take it that this increase of\r\nsuccessive discoveries has been due to the progressive perfection of\r\ntelescopes, or, perhaps, to increased education, so to speak, of the\r\neye, since Schmidt’s telescope is a much smaller instrument than that\r\nused by Beer and Maedler, and is regarded by its owner as an inferior\r\none for its size. We doubt not that there are hundreds more of these\r\ncracks which more perfect instruments and still sharper eyes will bring\r\nto knowledge in the future.\r\n\r\nWhile these chasms have all lengths from 150 miles (which is about the\r\nextent of those near Treisnecker) down to a few miles, they appear to\r\nhave a less variable breadth, since we do not find many that at their\r\nmaximum openings exceed two miles across; about a mile or less is their\r\nusual width throughout the greater part of their length, and generally\r\nthey taper off to invisibility at their extremities, where they do not\r\nencounter and terminate at a crater or other asperity, which is,\r\nhowever, sometimes the case. Of their depth we can form no precise\r\nestimate, though from the sharpness of their edges we may conclude that\r\ntheir sides approach perpendicularity, and, therefore, that their depth\r\nis very great; we have elsewhere suggested ten miles as a possible\r\nprofundity. In a few cases, and under very favourable circumstances, we\r\nhave observed their generally black interiors to be interrupted here and\r\nthere with bright spots suggestive of fragments from the sides of the\r\ncracks having fallen into the opening.\r\n\r\nIn seeking an explanation of these cracks, two possible causes suggest\r\nthemselves. One is the expansion of subsurface matter, already suggested\r\nas explanatory of the bright streaks; the other, a contraction of the\r\ncrust by cooling. We doubt not that both causes have been at work, one\r\nperhaps enhancing the other. Where, as in the cases we have pointed out,\r\nthere are cracks which are so connected with craters as to imply\r\nrelationship, we may conclude that an upheaving or expansive force in\r\nthe sublunar molten matter has given rise to the cracks, and that the\r\ncentral craters have been formed simultaneously, by the release, with\r\nejective violence, of the matter from its confining crust. The nature of\r\nthe expansive force being assumed that of solidifying matter, the wide\r\nextent of some chasms indicates a deep location of that force. And depth\r\nin this matter implies lateness (in the scale of selenological time) of\r\noperation, since the central portions of the globe would be the last to\r\ncool. Now, we have evidence of comparative lateness afforded by the fact\r\nthat in many cases the cracks have passed through craters and other\r\nasperities which thus obviously existed before the cracking commenced;\r\nand thus, so far, the hypothesis of the expansion-cracking is supported\r\nby absolute fact.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that such an upheaving force as we are invoking,\r\nbeing transitory, would allow the distended surface to collapse again\r\nwhen it ceased to operate, and so close the cracks or chasms it\r\nproduced. But we consider it not improbable that in some cases, as a\r\nconsequence of the expansion of subsurface matter, an upflow thereof may\r\nhave partially filled the crack, and by solidifying have held it open;\r\nand it is rational to suppose that there have been various degrees of\r\nfilling and even of overflow—that in some cases the rising matter has\r\nnot nearly reached the edge of the crack, as in Fig. 44, while in others\r\nit has risen almost to the surface, and in some instances has actually\r\noverrun it and produced some sort of elevation along the line of the\r\ncrack, like that represented sectionally in Fig. 45. It is probable that\r\nsome of the slightly tumescent lines on the moon’s surface have been\r\nthus produced.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n    GLASS GLOBE CRACKED BY INTERNAL PRESSURE.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\nWe have suggested shrinkage as a possible explanation of some cracks. It\r\ncould hardly have been the direct cause of those compound ones which are\r\ndistinguished by focal craters, though it may have been a co-operative\r\ncause, since the contracting tendency of any area of the crust, by so to\r\nspeak weakening it, may have virtually increased the strength of an\r\nupheaving force and thus have aided and localized its action. We see,\r\nhowever, no reason why the inevitable ultimate contraction which must\r\nhave attended the cooling of the moon’s crust, even when all internal\r\nreactions upon it had ceased, should not have created a class of cracks\r\nwithout accompanying craters, while it would doubtless have a tendency\r\nto increase the length and width of those already existing from any\r\nother cause. Some of the more minute clefts, which presumably exist in\r\ngreater numbers than we yet know of, may doubtless be ascribed to this\r\neffect of cooling contraction. In this view we should have to regard\r\nsuch cracks as the latest of all lunar features. Whether the agency that\r\nproduced them is still at work—whether the cracks are on the increase—is\r\na question impossible of solution: for reasons to be presently adduced,\r\nwe incline to believe that all cosmical heat passed from the moon, and\r\ntherefore that it arrived at its present, and apparently final,\r\ncondition ages upon ages ago.\r\n\r\nBesides the ridges spoken of on p. 140, and regarded as cracks up\r\nthrough which matter has been extruded, there are numerous ridges of\r\ngreater or less extent, which we conceive are of the nature of wrinkles,\r\nand have been produced by tangential compression due to the collapse of\r\nthe moon’s crust upon the shrunken interior, as explained and\r\nillustrated in Chap. III. The distinguishing feature of the two classes\r\nof phenomena we consider to be the presence of a serrated summit in\r\nthose of the extruded class, while those produced by “wrinkling” action\r\nhave their summits comparatively free from serration or marked\r\nirregularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n COLOUR AND BRIGHTNESS OF LUNAR DETAILS: CHRONOLOGY OF FORMATIONS, AND\r\n                     FINALITY OF EXISTING FEATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the details of the lunar surface seem to us to be\r\ndevoid of colour. To the naked eye of ordinary sensitiveness the moon\r\nappears to possess a silvery whiteness: more critical judges of colour\r\nwould describe it as presenting a yellowish tinge. Sir John Herschel,\r\nduring his sojourn at the Cape of Good Hope, had frequent opportunities\r\nof comparing the moon’s lustre with that of the weathered sandstone\r\nsurface of Table Mountain, when the moon was setting behind it, and both\r\nwere illuminated under the same direction of sunlight; and he remarked\r\nthat the moon was at such times “scarcely distinguishable from the rock\r\nin apparent contact with it.” Although his observations had reference\r\nchiefly to brightness, it can hardly be doubted that similarity of\r\ncolour is also implied; for any difference in the tint of the two\r\nobjects would have precluded the use of the words “scarcely\r\ndistinguishable;” a difference of colour interfering with a comparison\r\nof lustre in such an observation, though it must be remembered that he\r\nobserved through a dense stratum of atmosphere. Viewed in the telescope,\r\nthe same general yellowish-white colour prevails over all the moon, with\r\na few exceptions offered by the so-called seas. The _Mare Crisium_,\r\n_Mare Serenetatis_, and _Mare Humorum_ have somewhat of a greenish tint;\r\nthe _Palus Somnii_ and the circular area of Lichtenberg incline to\r\nruddiness. These tints are, however, extremely faint, and it has been\r\nsuggested by Arago that they may be mere effects of contrast rather than\r\nactual colouration of the surface material. This, however, can hardly be\r\nthe case, since all the “seas” are not alike affected; those that are\r\nslightly coloured are, as we have said, some green and some red, and\r\ncontrast could scarcely produce such variations. The supposition of\r\nvegetation covering these great flats and giving them a local colour is\r\nin our view still more untenable, in the face of the arguments that we\r\nshall presently adduce against the possibility of vegetable life\r\nexisting upon the moon.\r\n\r\nIt appears to us more rational to consider the tints due to actual\r\ncolour of the material (presumably lava or some once fluid mineral\r\nsubstance) that has covered these areas; and it may well be conceived\r\nthat the variety of tint is due to different characters of material, or\r\neven various conditions of the same material coming from different\r\ndepths below the lunar surface; and we may reasonably suppose that the\r\nsame variously-coloured substances occur in the rougher regions of the\r\nlunar surface, but that they exist there in patches too small to be\r\nrecognized by us, or are “put out” by the brightness to which polyhedral\r\nreflexion gives rise.\r\n\r\nSeeing that volcanic action has had so large a share in giving to the\r\nmoon’s surface its structural character, analogy of the most legitimate\r\norder justifies us in concluding not only that the materials of that\r\nsurface are of kindred nature to those of the unquestionably volcanic\r\nportions of the earth, but also that the tints and colours that\r\ncharacterize terrestrial volcanic and Plutonian products have their\r\ncounterparts on the moon. Those who have seen the interior and\r\nsurroundings of a terrestrial volcano after a recent eruption, and\r\nbefore atmospheric agents have exercised their dimming influences, must\r\nhave been struck with the colours of the erupted materials themselves\r\nand the varied brilliant tints conferred on these materials by the\r\nsublimated vapours of metals and mineral substances which have been\r\ndeposited upon them. If, then, analogy is any guide in enabling us to\r\ninfer the appearance of the invisible from that which we know to be of\r\nkindred nature and which we have seen, we may justly conclude that were\r\nthe moon brought sufficiently near to us to exhibit the minute\r\ncharacteristics of its surface, we should behold the same bright and\r\nvaried colours in and around its craters that we behold in and about\r\nthose of the earth; and in all probability the coloured materials of\r\nlunar volcanoes would be more fresh and vivid than those of the earth by\r\nreason of the absence of those atmospheric elements which tend so\r\nrapidly to impair the brightness of coloured surfaces exposed to their\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nSituated as we are, however, as regards distance from the moon, we have\r\nno chance of perceiving these local colours in their smaller masses; but\r\nit is by no means improbable, as we have suggested, that the faint tints\r\nexhibited by the great plains are due to broad expanses of coloured\r\nvolcanic material.\r\n\r\nBut if we fail to perceive diversity of colour upon the lunar surface,\r\nwe are in a very different position in regard to diversity of brightness\r\nor variable light-reflective power of different districts and details.\r\nThis will be tolerably obvious to those casual observers who have\r\nremarked nothing more of the moon’s physiography than the resemblance to\r\na somewhat lugubrious human countenance which the full moon exhibits,\r\nand which is due to the accidental disposition of certain large and\r\nsmall areas of surface material which have less of the light-reflecting\r\nproperty than other portions; for since all parts seen by a terrestrial\r\nobserver may be said to be equally shone upon by the sun, it is clear\r\nthat apparently bright and shaded parts must be produced by differences\r\nin the nature of the surface as regards power of reflecting the light\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the telescope and survey the full disc of the moon with\r\neven a very moderate amount of optical aid, the meagre impression as to\r\nvariety of degree of brightness which the unassisted eye conveys is\r\nvastly extended and enhanced, for the surface is seen to be diversified\r\nby shades of brilliancy and dullness from almost glittering white to\r\nsombre grey: and this variety of shading is rendered much more striking\r\nby shielding the eye with a dusky glass from the excessive glare, which\r\ndrowns the details in a flood of light. Under these circumstances the\r\nvarieties of light and shade become almost bewildering, and defy the\r\npower of brush or pencil to reproduce them.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, realize an imperfect idea of this characteristic of the\r\nlunar surface by reference to the self-drawn portrait of the full moon\r\nupon Plate III. This is, in fact, a photograph taken from the full moon\r\nitself, and enlarged sufficiently to render conspicuous the spots and\r\nlarge and small regions that are strikingly bright in comparison with\r\nwhat may in this place be described as the “ground” of the disc. As an\r\nexample of a wide and irregularly extensive district of highly\r\nreflective material, the region of which Tycho is the central object, is\r\nvery remarkable. We may refer also to the bright “splashes” of which\r\nCopernicus and Kepler are the centres. So brilliant are these spots that\r\nthey can easily be detected by the unassisted eye about the time of full\r\nmoon. Still brighter but less conspicuous by its size is the crater\r\nAristarchus, which shines with specular brightness, and almost induces\r\nthe belief that its interior is composed of some vitreous-surfaced\r\nmatter: the highly reflective nature of this object has often caused it\r\nto become conspicuous when in the dark hemisphere of the moon,\r\nunilluminated by the sun, and lighted only by the light reflected from\r\nthe earth. At these times it appears so bright that it has been taken\r\nfor a volcano in actual eruption, and no small amount of popular\r\nmisconception at one time arose therefrom concerning the conditions of\r\nthe moon as respects existing volcanic activity—a misconception that\r\nstill clings to the minds of many.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the surface distinguished by deficiency of reflecting power\r\nare conspicuous enough. We may cite, however, as an example of a detail\r\nportion especially remarkable for its dingy aspect, the interior of the\r\ncrater Plato, which is one of the darkest spots (the darkest well\r\ndefined one) upon the hemisphere of the moon visible to us. For\r\nfacilitating reference to shades of luminosity, Schroeter and Lohrman\r\nassorted the variously reflective parts into 10 grades, commencing with\r\nthe darkest. Grades 1 to 3 comprised the various deep greys; 4 and 5 the\r\nlight greys; 6 and 7 white; and 8 to 10 brilliant white. The spots\r\nGrimaldi and Riccioli came under class 1 of this notation; Plato between\r\n1 and 2. The “seas” generally ranged from 2 to 3; the brightest\r\nmountainous portions mostly between degrees 4 and 6; the crater walls\r\nand the bright streaks came between these and the bright peaks, which\r\nfell under the 9th grade. The maximum brightness, the 10th grade, is\r\ninstanced only in the ease of Aristarchus and a point in Werner, though\r\nProclus nearly approaches it, as do many bright spots, chiefly the sites\r\nof minute craters, which make their appearance at the time of full moon.\r\n\r\nIn photographic pictures produced by the moon of itself, there is always\r\nan apparent exaggeration in the relation of light to dark portions of\r\nthe disc. The dusky parts look, upon the photograph, much darker than to\r\nthe eye directed to the moon itself, whether assisted or not by optical\r\nappliances. It may be that the real cause of this discrepancy is that\r\nthe eye fails to discover the actual difference upon the moon itself,\r\nbeing insensible to the higher degrees of brightness or not estimating\r\nthem at their proper brilliance with respect to parts less bright. On\r\nthe other hand, it is probable that the enhanced contrast in the\r\nphotograph is due to some peculiar condition of the darker surface\r\nmatter affecting its power of reflecting the actinic constituent of the\r\nrays that fall upon it.\r\n\r\nThe study of the varying brightness or reflective power of different\r\nregions and spots of the lunar disc leads us to the consideration of the\r\nrelative antiquity of the surface features; for it is hardly possible to\r\nregard these variations attentively without being impressed with the\r\nconviction that they have relation to some chronological order of\r\nformation. We cannot, in the first place, resist the conviction that the\r\nbrightest features were the latest formed; this strikes us as evident on\r\n_primâ facie_ grounds; but it becomes more clearly so when we remark\r\nthat the bright formations, as a rule, overlie the duller features. The\r\nelevated parts of the crust are brighter than the “seas” and other\r\nareas; and it is pretty clear that the former are newer than the latter,\r\nupon which they appear to be super-imposed, or through which they seem\r\nto have extruded.[13] The vast dusky plains are in every instance more\r\nor less sprinkled with spots and minute craters, and these last were\r\nobviously formed after the area that contains them. One is almost\r\ndisposed to place the order of formations in the order of relative\r\nbrightness, and so consider the dingiest parts the oldest and the\r\nbrightest spots and craters the newest features, though, in the absence\r\nof an atmosphere competent to impair the reflective power of the surface\r\nmaterials, we are unable to justify this classification by suggesting a\r\ncause for such a deterioration by time as the hypothesis pre-supposes.\r\n\r\nAs we have entered upon the question of relative age of the lunar\r\nfeatures, we may remark that there are evidences of various epochs of\r\nformation of particular classes of details, irrespective of their\r\ncondition in respect of brightness, or, as we may say, freshness of\r\nmaterial. As a rule, the large craters are older than the small ones.\r\nThis is proved by the fact that a large object of this class is never\r\nseen to interfere with or overlap a small one. Those of nearly equal\r\nsize are, however, seen to overlap one another as though several\r\neruptions of equal intensity had occurred from the same source at\r\ndifferent points. This is strikingly instanced in the group of craters\r\nsituated in the position 35-141 on our map, the order of formation of\r\neach of which is clearly apparent. The region about Tycho offers an\r\ninexhaustible field for study of these phenomena of overlapping or\r\ninterpolating craters, and it will be found, with very few exceptions,\r\nthat the smaller crater is the impinging or parasitical one, and must\r\ntherefore have been formed after the larger, upon which it intrudes or\r\nimpinges. There are frequent cases in which a large crater has had its\r\nrampart interrupted by a lesser one, and this again has been broken into\r\nby one still smaller; and instances may be found where a fourth crater\r\nsmaller than all has intruded itself upon the previous intruder. The\r\ngeneral tendency of these examples is to show that the craters\r\ndiminished in size as the moon’s volcanic energy subsided: that the\r\nlargest were produced in the throes of its early violence, and that the\r\nsmallest are the results of expiring efforts possibly impeded through\r\nthe deep-seatedness of the ejective source.\r\n\r\nAnother general fact of this chronological order is that the mountain\r\nchains are never seen to intrude upon formations of the crater order. We\r\ndo not anywhere find that a mountain chain runs absolutely into or\r\nthrough a crater; but, on the other hand, we do find that craters have\r\nformed on mountain chains. This leads unmistakably to the inference that\r\nthe craters were not formed _before_ their allied mountain chains; and\r\nwe might assume therefore that the mountains generally are the older\r\nformations, but that there is nothing to prove that the two classes of\r\nfeatures, where they intermingle, as in the Apennines and Caucasus, were\r\nnot erupted cotemporaneously.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XX.\r\n    OVERLAPPING CRATERS.]\r\n\r\nUpon the assumption that the latest ejected or extruded matter is that\r\nwhich is brightest, we should place the bright streaks among the more\r\nrecent features. Be this as it may, it is tolerably certain that the\r\ncracks, whose apparently close relation to the radiating streaks we have\r\nendeavoured to point out, are relatively of a very late formative\r\nperiod. We are indeed disposed to consider them as the most recent\r\nfeatures of all: the evidence in support of this consideration being the\r\nfact that they are sometimes found intersecting small craters that, from\r\nthe way in which they are cut through by the cracks, must have been _in\r\nsitu_ before the cracking agency came into operation. It is in\r\naccordance with our hypothesis of the moon’s transition from a fluid to\r\na solid body to consider that a cracking of the surface would be the\r\nlatest of all the phenomena produced by contraction in final cooling.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks naturally lead us to the question whether changes\r\nare still going on upon the surface of our satellite: whether there is\r\nstill left in it a spark of its volcanic activity, or whether that\r\nactivity has become totally extinct. We shall consider this question\r\nfrom the observational and theoretical point of view. First as regards\r\nobservations. This much may be affirmed indisputably—that no object or\r\ndetail visible to the earliest selenographers (whose period may be dated\r\n200 years back) has altered from the date of their maps to the present.\r\nWhen we pass from the bolder features to the more minute details we find\r\nourselves at a loss for materials for forming an inference; the only map\r\npretending to accuracy even of the larger among small objects being that\r\nof Beer and Maedler, which, truly admirable as it is, is not very safely\r\nto be relied upon for settling any question of alleged change, on\r\naccount of the conventional system adopted for exhibiting the forms of\r\nobjects, every object being mapped rather than drawn, and shown as it\r\nnever is or can be presented to view on the moon itself. This difficulty\r\nwould present itself if a question of change were ever raised upon the\r\nevidence of Beer and Maedler’s map: it may indeed have prevented such a\r\nquestion being raised, for certainly no one has hitherto been bold\r\nenough to assert that any portion or detail of the map fails to\r\nrepresent the actual state of the moon at the present time.\r\n\r\nIn default of published maps, we are thrown for evidence on this\r\nquestion upon observations and recollections of individual observers\r\nwhose familiarity with the lunar details extends over lengthy periods.\r\nSpeaking for ourselves, and upon the strength of close scrutinies\r\ncontinued with assiduity through the past thirty years, we may say that\r\nwe have never had the suspicion suggested to our eye of any actual\r\nchange whatever having taken place in any feature or minute detail of\r\nthe lunar surface; and our scrutinies have throughout been made with\r\nample optical means, mostly with a 20-inch reflector. This experience\r\nhas made us not unnaturally in some slight degree sceptical concerning\r\nthe changes alleged to have been detected by others. Those asserted by\r\nSchroeter and Gruithuisen were long ago rejected by Beer and Maedler,\r\nwho explained them, where the accuracy of the observer was not\r\nquestioned, by variations of illumination, a cause of illusory change\r\nwhich is not always sufficiently taken into account. A notable instance\r\nof this deception occurred a few years ago in the case of the minute\r\nbright crater _Linné_, which was for a considerable period declared,\r\nupon the strength of observations of very promiscuous character, to be\r\nvarying in form and dimensions almost daily, but the alleged constant\r\nchanges of which have since been tacitly regarded as due to varying\r\ncircumstances of illumination induced by combinations of libratory\r\neffects with the ordinary changes depending upon the direction of the\r\nsun’s rays as due to the age of the moon. This explanation does not,\r\nhowever, dispose of the question whether the crater under notice\r\nsuffered any actual change before the hue and cry was raised concerning\r\nit. Attention was first directed to it by Schmidt, of Athens, whose\r\npowers of observation are known to be remarkable, and whose labours upon\r\nthe moon are of such extent and minuteness as to claim for his\r\nassertions the most respectful consideration.[14] He affirmed in 1866\r\nthat the crater at that date presented an appearance decidedly different\r\nfrom that which it had had since 1841: that whereas it had been from the\r\nearlier epoch always easily seen as a very deep crater, in October 1866\r\nand thenceforward it presented only a white spot, with at most but a\r\nvery shallow aperture, very difficult to be detected. Schmidt is one of\r\nthe very few observers whose long familiarity with the moon entitles him\r\nto speak with confidence upon such a question as that before us upon the\r\nsole strength of his own experience; and this case is but an isolated\r\none, at least it is the only one he has brought forward. He is, however,\r\nstill firmly convinced that it is an instance of actual change, and not\r\nan illusion resulting from some peculiar condition of illumination of\r\nthe object. It should be added also on this side of the discussion that\r\nan English observer, the Rev. T. W. Webb, while apparently indisposed to\r\nconcede the supposition of any notable changes in the lunar features,\r\nhas yet found from his own observations that, after all due allowance\r\nfor differences of light and shade upon objects at different times,\r\nthere is still a “residuum of minute variations not thus disposed of”\r\nwhich seem to indicate that eruptive action in the moon has not yet\r\nentirely died out, though its manifestation at present is very limited\r\nin extent. It appears to us that, if evidence of continuing volcanic\r\naction is to be sought on the moon, the place to look for it is around\r\nthe circumference of the disc, where eruption from any marginal orifice\r\nwould manifest itself in the form of a protruding haziness, somewhat as\r\nillustrated to an exaggerated extent in the annexed cut.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\nThe theoretical view of the question, which we have now to consider, has\r\nled us, however, to the strong belief that no vestige of its former\r\nvolcanic activity lingers in the moon—that it assumed its final\r\ncondition an inconceivable number of ages ago, and that the high\r\ninterest which would attach to the close scrutiny of our satellite if it\r\n_were_ still the theatre of volcanic reactions cannot be hoped for. If\r\nit be just and allowable to assume that the earth and the moon were\r\ncondensed into planetary form at nearly the same epoch (and the only\r\nrational scheme of cosmogony justifies the assumption) then we may\r\ninstitute a comparison between the condition of the two bodies as\r\nrespects their volcanic age, using the one as a basis for inference\r\nconcerning the state of the other. We have reason to believe that the\r\nearth’s crust has nearly assumed its final state so far as volcanic\r\nreactions of its interior upon its exterior are concerned: we may affirm\r\nthat within the historical period no igneous convulsions of any\r\nconsiderable magnitude have occurred; and we may consider that the\r\nvolcanoes now active over the surface of the globe represent the last\r\nexpiring efforts of its eruptive force. Now in the earth we perceive\r\nseveral conditions wherefrom we may infer that it parted with its\r\ncosmical heat (and therefore with its prime source of volcanic agency)\r\nat a rate which will appear relatively very slow when we come to compare\r\nthe like conditions in the moon. We may, we think, take for granted that\r\nthe surface of a planetary body generally determines its _heat\r\ndispersing_ power, while its volume determines its _heat retaining_\r\npower. Given two spherical bodies of similar material but of unequal\r\nmagnitude and originally possessing the same degree of heat, the smaller\r\nbody will cool more rapidly than the larger, by reason of the greater\r\nproportion which the surface of the smaller sphere bears to its volume\r\nthan that of the larger sphere to its volume—this proportion depending\r\nupon the geometrical ratio which the surfaces of spheres bear to their\r\nvolumes, the contents of spheres being as the _cubes_ and the surfaces\r\nas the _squares_ of their diameters. The volume of the earth is 49 times\r\nas great as that of the moon, but its surface is only 13 times as great;\r\nthere is consequently in the earth a power of retaining its cosmical\r\nheat nearly four times as great as in the case of the moon; in other\r\nwords, the moon and earth being supposed at one time to have had an\r\nequally high temperature, the moon would cool down to a given low\r\ntemperature in about one fourth the time that the earth would require to\r\ncool to the same temperature. But the earth’s cosmical heat has without\r\ndoubt been considerably conserved by its vaporous atmosphere, and still\r\nmore by the ocean in its antecedent vaporous form. Yet notwithstanding\r\nall this, the earth’s surface has nearly assumed its final condition so\r\nfar as volcanic agencies are concerned: it has so far cooled as to be\r\nsubject to no considerable distortions or disruptions of its surface.\r\nWhat then must be the state of the moon, which, from its small volume\r\nand large proportionate area, parted with its heat at the above\r\ncomparatively rapid rate? The matter of the moon is, too, less dense\r\nthan the earth, and hence doubtless from this cause disposed to more\r\nrapid cooling; and it has no atmosphere or vaporous envelope to retard\r\nits radiating heat. We are driven thus to the conclusion that the moon’s\r\nloss of cosmical heat must have been so rapid as to have allowed its\r\nsurface to assume its final conformation ages on ages ago, and hence\r\nthat it is unreasonable and hopeless to look for evidence of change of\r\nany volcanic character still going on.\r\n\r\nWe conceive it possible, however, that minute changes of a non-volcanic\r\ncharacter may be proceeding in the moon, arising from the violent\r\nalternations of temperature to which the surface is exposed during a\r\nlunar day and night. The sun, as we know, pours down its heat\r\nunintermittingly for a period of fully 300 hours upon the lunar surface,\r\nand the experimental investigations of Lord Rosse, essentially confirmed\r\nby those of the French observer, Marie Davy, show that under this\r\npowerful insolation the surface becomes heated to a degree which is\r\nestimated at about 500° of Fahrenheit’s scale, the fusing point of tin\r\nor bismuth. This heat, however, is entirely radiated away during the\r\nequally long lunar night, and, as Sir John Herschel surmised, the\r\nsurface probably cools down again to a temperature as low as that of\r\ninterstellar space: this has been assumed as representing the absolute\r\nzero of temperature, which has been calculated from experiments to be\r\n250° below the zero of Fahrenheit’s scale. Now such a severe range of\r\nheat and cold can hardly be without effect upon some of the component\r\nmaterials of the lunar surface.[15] If there be any such materials as\r\nthe vitreous lavas that are found about our volcanoes, such as obsidian\r\nfor instance, they are doubtless cracked and shivered by these extreme\r\ntransitions of temperature; and this comparatively rapid succession of\r\nchanges continued through long ages would, we may suppose, result in a\r\ndisintegration of some parts of the surface and at length somewhat\r\nmodify the selenographic contour. It is, however, possible that the\r\nsurface matter is mainly composed of more crystalline and porous lavas,\r\nand these might withstand the fierce extremes like the “fire-brick” of\r\nmundane manufacture, to which in molecular structure they may be\r\nconsidered comparable. Lavas as a rule are (upon the earth) of this\r\nunvitreous nature, and if they are of like constitution on the moon,\r\nthere will be little reason to suspect changes from the cause we are\r\nconsidering. Where, however, the material, whatever its nature, is piled\r\nin more or less detached masses, there will doubtless be a grating and\r\nfracturing at the points of contact of one mass with another, produced\r\nby alternate expansions and contractions of the entire masses, which in\r\nthe long run of ages must bring about dislocations or dislodgments of\r\nmatter that might considerably affect the surface features from a close\r\npoint of view, but which can hardly be of sufficient magnitude to be\r\ndetected by a terrestrial observer whose best aids to vision give him no\r\nperception of minute configurations. And it must always be borne in mind\r\nthat changes can only be _proved_ by reference to previous observations\r\nand delineations of unquestionable accuracy.\r\n\r\nSpeaking by our own lights, from our own experience and reasoning, we\r\nare disposed to conclude that in all visible aspects the lunar surface\r\nis unchangeable, that in fact it arrived at its terminal condition\r\n_eons_ of ages ago, and that in the survey of its wonderful features,\r\neven in the smallest details, we are presented with the sight of objects\r\nof such transcendent antiquity as to render the oldest geological\r\nfeatures of the earth modern by comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n          THE MOON AS A WORLD: DAY AND NIGHT UPON ITS SURFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA wide interest, if not a deep one, attaches to the general question as\r\nto the existence of living beings, or at least the possibility of\r\norganic existence, on planetary bodies other than our own. The question\r\nhas been examined in all ages, by the lights of the science peculiar to\r\neach. With every important accession to our astronomical knowledge it\r\nhas been re-raised: every considerable discovery has given rise to some\r\nnew step or phase in the discussion, and in this way there has grown up\r\na somewhat extensive literature exclusively relating to mundane\r\nplurality. It will readily be understood that the moon, from its\r\nproximity to the earth, has from the first received a large, perhaps the\r\nlargest, share of attention from wanderers into this field of\r\nspeculation: and we might add greatly to the bulk of this volume by\r\nmerely reviewing some of the more curious and, in their way, instructive\r\nconjectures specially relating to the moon as a world—to imaginary\r\njourneys towards her, and to the beings conjectured to dwell upon and\r\nwithin her. This, however, we feel there is no occasion to do, for it is\r\nour purpose merely to point out the two or three almost conclusive\r\narguments against the possibility of any life, animal or vegetable,\r\nhaving existence on our satellite.\r\n\r\nWe well know what are the requisite conditions of life on the earth; and\r\nwe can go no further for grounds of inference; for if we were to start\r\nby assuming forms of life capable of existence under conditions widely\r\nand essentially different from those pertaining to our planet, there\r\nwould be no need for discussing our subject further: we could revel in\r\nconjectures, without a thought as to their extravagance. The only\r\nlegitimate phase of the question we can entertain is this:—can there be\r\non the moon any kind of living things analogous to any kind of living\r\nthings upon the earth? And this question, we think, admits only of a\r\nnegative answer. The lowest forms of vitality cannot exist without air,\r\nmoisture, and a moderate range of temperature. It may be true, as recent\r\nexperiments seem to show, that organic germs will retain their vitality\r\nwithout either of the first, and with exposure to intense cold and to a\r\nconsiderable degree of heat; and it is conceivable that the mere germs\r\nof life may be present on the moon.[16] But this is not the case with\r\nliving organisms themselves. We have, in Chapter V., specially devoted\r\nto the subject, cited the evidence from which we know that there can be\r\nat the most, no more air on the moon than is left in the receiver of an\r\nair-pump after the ordinary process of exhaustion. And with regard to\r\nmoisture, it could not exist in any but the vaporous state, and we know\r\nthat no appreciable amount of vapour can be discovered by any\r\nobservation (and some of them are crucial enough) that we are capable of\r\nmaking. We may suppose it just within the verge of possibility that some\r\nlow forms of vegetation might exist upon the moon with a paucity of air\r\nand moisture such as would be beyond even our most severe powers of\r\ndetection: but granting even this, we are met by the temperature\r\ndifficulty; for it is inconceivable that any plant-life could survive\r\nexposure first to a degree of cold vastly surpassing that of our arctic\r\nregions, and then in a short time (14 days) to a degree of heat capable\r\nof melting the more fusible metals—the total range being equal, as we\r\nhave elsewhere shown, to perhaps 600 or 700 degrees of our thermometric\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThe higher forms of vegetation could not reasonably be expected to exist\r\nunder conditions which the lower forms could not survive. And as regards\r\nthe possibility of the existence of animal life in any form or condition\r\non the lunar surface, the reasons we have adduced in reference to the\r\nnon-existence of vegetable life bear still more strongly against the\r\npossibility of the existence of the former. We know of no animal that\r\ncould live in what may be considered a vacuum and under such thermal\r\nconditions as we have indicated.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XXI.\r\n    NORMAL LUNAR CRATER.]\r\n\r\nAs to man, aëronautic experience teaches us that human life is\r\nendangered when the atmosphere is still sufficiently dense to support 12\r\ninches of mercury in the barometer tube; what then would be his\r\ncondition in a medium only sufficiently dense to sustain one-tenth of an\r\ninch of the barometric column? We have evidence from the most delicate\r\ntests that no atmosphere or vapour approaching even this degree of\r\nattenuation exists around the moon’s surface.\r\n\r\nTaking all these adverse conditions into consideration we are in every\r\nrespect justified in concluding that there is no possibility of animal\r\nor vegetable life existing on the moon, and that our satellite must\r\ntherefore be regarded as a barren world.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter this disquisition upon lunar uninhabitability it may appear\r\nsomewhat inconsistent for us to attempt a description of the scenery of\r\nthe moon and some other effects that would be visible to a spectator,\r\nand of which he would be otherwise sensible, during a day and a night\r\nupon her surface. But we can offer the sufficient apology that an\r\nimaginary sojourn of one complete lunar day and night upon the moon\r\naffords an opportunity of marshalling before our readers some phenomena\r\nthat are proper to be noticed in a work of this character, and that have\r\nnecessarily been passed over in the series of chapters on consecutive\r\nand special points that have gone before. It may be urged that, in\r\ndepicting the moon from such a standpoint as that now to be taken, we\r\nare describing scenes that never have been such in the literal sense of\r\nthe word, since no eye has ever beheld them. Still we have this\r\njustification—that we are invoking the conception of things that\r\nactually exist; and that we are not, like some imaginary voyagers to the\r\nmoon, indulging in mere flights of fancy. Although it is impossible for\r\na habitant of this earth fully to realise existence upon the moon, it is\r\nyet possible, indeed almost inevitable, for a thoughtful\r\ntelescopist—watching the moon night after night, observing the sun rise\r\nupon a lunar scene, and noting the course of effects that follow till it\r\nsets—it is almost inevitable, we say, for such an observer to identify\r\nhimself so far with the object of his scrutiny, as sometimes to become\r\nin thought a lunar being. Seated in silence and in solitude at a\r\npowerful telescope, abstracted from terrestrial influences, and gazing\r\nupon the revealed details of some strikingly characteristic region of\r\nthe moon, it requires but a small effort of the imagination to suppose\r\none’s self actually upon the lunar globe, viewing some distant landscape\r\nthereupon; and under these circumstances there is an irresistible\r\ntendency in the mind to pass beyond the actually _visible_, and to fill\r\nin with what it knows must exist those accessory features and phenomena\r\nthat are only hidden from us by distance and by our peculiar point of\r\nview. Where the material eye is baffled, the clairvoyance of reason and\r\nanalogy comes to its aid.\r\n\r\nLet us then endeavour to realize the strange consequences which the\r\nposition and conditions of the moon produce upon the aspect of a lunar\r\nlandscape in the course of a lunar day and night.\r\n\r\nThe moon’s day is a long one. From the time that the sun rises upon a\r\nscene[17] till it sets, a period of 304 hours elapses, and of course\r\ndouble this interval passes between one sunrise and the next. The\r\nconsequences of this slow march of the sun begin to show themselves from\r\nthe instant that he rises above the lunar horizon. Dawn, as we have it\r\non earth, can have no counterpart upon the moon. No atmosphere is there\r\nto reflect the solar beams while the luminary is yet out of actual\r\nsight, and only the glimmer of the zodiacal light heralds the approach\r\nof day. From the black horizon the sun suddenly darts his bright\r\nuntempered beams upon the mountain tops, crowning them with dazzling\r\nbrilliance while their flanks and valleys are yet in utter darkness.\r\nThere is no blending of the night into day. And yet there is a growth of\r\nillumination that in its early stages may be called a twilight, and\r\nwhich is caused by the slow rise of the sun. Upon the earth, in central\r\nlatitudes, the average time occupied by the sun in rising, from the\r\nfirst glint of his upper edge till the whole disc is in sight, is but\r\ntwo minutes and a quarter. Upon the moon, however, this time is extended\r\nto a few minutes short of an hour, and, therefore, during the first few\r\nminutes a dim light will be shed by the small visible chord of the solar\r\ndisc, and this will give a proportionately modified degree of\r\nillumination upon the prominent portion of the landscape, and impart to\r\nit something of the weird aspect which so strikes an observer of a total\r\nsolar eclipse on earth when the scene is lit by the thin crescent of the\r\nre-appearing sun. This impaired illumination constitutes the only dawn\r\nthat a lunar spectator could behold. And it must be of short duration;\r\nfor when, in the course of half an hour, the solar disc has risen half\r\ninto view the lighting would no doubt appear nearly as bright to the eye\r\nas when the entire disc of the sun is above the horizon. In this lunar\r\nsunrise, however, there is none of that gilding and glowing which makes\r\nthe phenomenon on earth so gorgeous. Those crimson sky-tints with which\r\nwe are familiar are due to the absorption of certain of the polychromous\r\nrays of light by our atmosphere. The blue and violet components of the\r\nsolar beams are intercepted by our envelope of vapour, and only the red\r\nportions are free to pass; while on the moon, as there is no atmosphere,\r\nthis selective absorption does not occur. If it did, an observer gazing\r\nfrom the earth upon the regions of the moon upon which the sun is just\r\nrising would see the surface tinted with rosy light. This, however, is\r\nnot the case; the faintest lunar features just catching the sun are seen\r\nsimply under white light diluted to a low degree of brightness. Only\r\nupon rare occasions is the lunar scenery suffused with coloured\r\nillumination, and these are when, as we shall presently have to\r\ndescribe, the solar rays reach the moon after traversing the earth’s\r\natmosphere during an eclipse of the sun.\r\n\r\nThis atmosphere of ours is the most influential element in beautifying\r\nour terrestrial scenery, and the absence of such an appendage from the\r\nmoon is the great modifying cause that affects lunar scenery as compared\r\nwith that of the earth. We are accustomed to the sun with its dazzling\r\nbrightness—overpowering though it be—subdued and softened by our\r\nvaporous screen. Upon the moon there is no such modification. The sun’s\r\nintrinsic brilliancy is undiminished, its apparent distance is\r\nshortened, and it gleams out in fierce splendour only to be realised,\r\nand then imperfectly, by the conception of a gigantic electric light a\r\nfew feet from the eye. And the brightness is rendered the more striking\r\nby the blackness of the surrounding sky. Since there is no atmosphere\r\nthere can be no sky-light, for there is nothing above the lunar world to\r\ndiffuse the solar beams; not a trace of that moisture which even in our\r\ntropical skies scatters some of the sun’s light and gives a certain\r\ndegree of opacity or blueness, deep though it be, to the heavens by day.\r\nUpon the moon, with no light-diffusing vapour, the sky must be as dark\r\nor even darker than that with which we are familiar upon the finest of\r\nmoonless nights. And this blackness prevails in the full blaze of the\r\nlunar noon-day sun. If the eye (upon the moon) could bear to gaze upon\r\nthe solar orb (which would be less possible than upon earth) or could it\r\nbe screened from the direct beams, as doubtless it could by intervening\r\nobjects, it would perceive the nebulous and other appendages which we\r\nknow as the corona, the zodiacal light, and the red solar protuberances:\r\nor if these appendages could not be viewed with the sun above the\r\nhorizon they would certainly be seen in glorious perfection when the\r\nluminary was about to rise or immediately after it had set.\r\n\r\nAnd, notwithstanding the sun’s presence, the planets and stars would be\r\nseen to shine more brilliantly than we see them on the clearest of\r\nnights; the constellations would have the same configurations, though\r\nthey would be differently situated with respect to the celestial pole\r\nabout which they would appear to turn, for the axis of rotation of the\r\nmoon is directed towards a point in the constellation Draco. The stars\r\nwould never twinkle or change colour as they appear to us to do, for\r\nscintillation or twinkling is a phenomenon of atmospheric origin, and\r\nthey would retain their full brightness, down even to the horizon, since\r\nthere would be no haze to diminish their light. The planets, and the\r\nbrighter stars at least, would be seen even when they were situated very\r\nnear to the sun. The planet Mercury, so seldom detected by terrestrial\r\ngazers, would be almost constantly in view during the lunar day,\r\nmanifesting his close attendance on the central luminary by making only\r\nshort excursions of about two (lunar) days’ length, first on one side\r\nand then on the other. Venus would be nearly as continuously visible,\r\nthough her wanderings would be more extensive on either side. The\r\nzodiacal light also, which in our English latitude and climate is but\r\nrarely seen and in more favourable climes appears only when the sun\r\nitself is hidden beneath the horizon, would upon the moon be seen as a\r\nconstant accompaniment to the luminary throughout his daily course\r\nacross the lunar sky. The other planets would appear generally as they\r\ndo to us on earth, but, never being lost in daylight, their courses\r\namong the stars could be traced with scarcely any interruption.\r\n\r\nOne planet, however, that adorns the sky of the lunar hemisphere which\r\nis turned towards us deserves special mention from the conspicuous and\r\nhighly interesting appearance it must present. We allude to the earth.\r\nTo nearly one-half of the moon (that which we never see) this imposing\r\nobject can never be visible; but to the half that faces us the\r\nterrestrial planet must appear almost fixed in the sky. A lunar\r\nspectator in (what is to us) the centre of the disc, or about the region\r\nnorth of the lunar mountains Ptolemy and Hipparchus, would have the\r\nearth in his zenith. From regions upon the moon a little out of what is\r\nto us the centre, a spectator would see the earth a little declining\r\nfrom the zenith, and this declination would increase as the regions\r\ncorresponding to the (to us) apparent edge of the moon were approached,\r\ntill at the actual edge it would be seen only upon the horizon. From the\r\nphenomena of libration (explained in Chap. VI.) the earth would appear\r\nfrom nearly all parts of the lunar hemisphere to which it is visible at\r\nall to describe a small circle in the sky. To an observer, however, upon\r\nthe (to us) marginal regions of the lunar globe, it would appear only\r\nduring a portion of the lunar day—being visible in fact only in that\r\npart of its small circular path which happened to lie above the\r\nobserver’s horizon: in some regions only a portion of the terrestrial\r\ndisc would make its brief appearance. From the lunar hemisphere beyond\r\nthis marginal line the earth can never be seen at all.\r\n\r\nThe lunar spectator whose situation enabled him to view the earth would\r\nsee it as a moon; and a glorious moon indeed it must be. Its diameter\r\nwould be four times as great as that of the moon itself as seen by us,\r\nand the area of its full disc 13 times as great. It would be seen to\r\npass through its phases, just as does our satellite, once in a lunar day\r\nor a terrestrial month, and during that cycle of phases, since 29 of our\r\ndays would be occupied by it, the axial rotation would bring all the\r\nfeatures of its surface configuration into view so many times in\r\nsuccession. But the greatest beauty of this noble moon would be seen\r\nduring the lunar night, in considering which we shall again allude to\r\nit; for when it is full-moon to the earth it is new-earth to the moon.\r\nAt lunar midnight this globe of ours is fully illuminated; as morning\r\nnears, the earth-moon wanes, its disc slowly passing through the gibbous\r\nphases until at sunrise it would be just half-illuminated. During the\r\nlong forenoon it assumes a crescent which narrows and narrows till at\r\nmidday the sun is in line with the earth and the latter is invisible,\r\nsave perhaps by a thin line of light marking its upper or lower edge,\r\naccordingly as the sun is apparently above or below it. In the lunar\r\nafternoon an illuminated crescent appears upon the opposite side of the\r\nterrestrial globe, and this widens and widens till it becomes a half\r\ndisc by lunar sunset and a full disc by lunar midnight.\r\n\r\nThe sun in his daily course passes at various distances, sometimes above\r\nand sometimes below, the nearly stationary earth. Obviously it will at\r\ntimes pass actually behind it, and then the lunar spectator would behold\r\nthe sublime spectacle of a total solar eclipse, and that under\r\ncircumstances which render the phenomenon far more imposing than its\r\ncounterpart can appear from the earth; for whereas, when we see the moon\r\neclipse the sun, the nearly similar (apparent) diameters of the two\r\nbodies renders the duration of totality extremely short—at most 7\r\nminutes—a lunar spectator, the earth appearing to him four times the\r\ndiameter of the sun, and he and the earth being relatively stationary,\r\nwould enjoy a view of the totality extending over several hours. During\r\nthe passage of the solar disc behind that of the earth, a beautiful\r\nsuccession of luminous phenomena would be observed to follow from the\r\nrefractions and dispersions which the sunbeams would suffer in passing\r\ntangentially through those parts of our atmospheric envelope which lie\r\nin their course; those, for instance, on the margin of the earth, as\r\nseen from the moon. As the sun passed behind the earth, the latter would\r\nbe encircled upon the in-going side with a beautiful line of golden\r\nlight, deepening in places to glowing crimson, due to the absorption,\r\nalready spoken of, of all but the red and orange rays of the sun’s light\r\nby the vapours of our atmosphere. As the eclipse proceeded and totality\r\ncame on, this ruddy glow would extend itself nearly, if not all, around\r\nthe black earth, and so bright would it be, that the whole lunar\r\nlandscape covered by the earth’s shadow would be illuminated with faint\r\ncrimson light,[18] save, perhaps, in some parts of the far distance,\r\nupon which the earth had not yet cast its shadow, or off which the\r\nshadow had passed. Although the crimson light would preponderate, it\r\nwould not appear bright and red alike all around the earth’s periphery.\r\nThe circle of light would be, in fact, _the ring of twilight_ round our\r\nglobe, and it would only appear red in those places where the atmosphere\r\nchanced to be in that condition favourable for producing what on earth\r\nwe know as red sunset and sunrise. We know that the sun, even in clear\r\nsky, does not always set and rise with the beautiful red glow, which may\r\nbe determined by merely local causes, and will therefore vary in\r\ndifferent parts of the earth. Now a lunar spectator watching the sun\r\neclipsed by the earth, would see, during totality and at a _coup d’œil_,\r\nevery point around our world upon which the sun is setting on one side\r\nand rising upon the other. To every part of the earth around what is\r\nthen the margin, as seen from the moon, the sun is upon the horizon,\r\nshining through a great thickness of atmosphere, reddening it, and being\r\nreddened by it wherever the vaporous conditions conduce to that\r\ncolouration. And at all parts where these conditions obtain, the lunar\r\neclipse-observer would see the ring of light around the black\r\nearth-globe brilliantly crimsoned; at other parts it would have other\r\nshades of red and yellow, and the whole effect would be to make the\r\ngrand earth-ball, hanging in the lunar sky, like a dark sphere in a\r\ncircle of glittering gold and rubies.\r\n\r\nDuring the early stages of the eclipse, this chaplet of\r\nbrilliant-coloured lights would be brightest upon the side of the\r\n_disappearing_ sun; at the time of central eclipse the radiance\r\n(supposing the sun to pass centrally behind the earth) would be equally\r\ndistributed, and during the later stages it would preponderate upon the\r\nside of the _reappearing_ sun. We have endeavoured to give a pictorial\r\nrealization of this phenomenon and of the effect of the eclipse upon the\r\nlunar landscape, but such a picture cannot but fall very, very far short\r\nof the reality. (See Plate XXII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now for a time let us turn attention from the lunar sky to the\r\nscenery of the lunar landscape. Let us, in imagination, take our stand\r\nhigh upon the eastern side of the rampart of one of the great craters.\r\nHeight, it must be remarked, is more essential on the moon to command\r\nextent of view than upon the earth, for on account of the comparative\r\nsmallness of the lunar sphere the dip of the horizon is very rapid. Such\r\nheight, however, would be attained without great exercise of muscular\r\npower, since equal amounts of climbing energy would, from the smallness\r\nof lunar gravity, take a man six times as high on the moon as on the\r\nearth. Let us choose, for instance, the hill-side of Copernicus. The day\r\nbegins by a sudden transition. The faint looming of objects under the\r\nunited illumination of the half-full earth and the zodiacal light is the\r\nlunar precursor of day-break. Suddenly the highest mountain peaks\r\nreceive the direct rays of a portion of the sun’s disc as it emerges\r\nfrom below the horizon. The brilliant lighting of these summits serves\r\nbut to increase, by contrast, the prevailing darkness, for they seem to\r\nfloat like islands of light in a sea of gloom. At a rate of motion\r\ntwenty-eight times slower than we are accustomed to, the light tardily\r\ncreeps down the mountain-sides, and in the course of about twelve hours\r\nthe whole of the circular rampart of the great crater below us, and\r\ntowards the east, shines out in brilliant light, unsoftened by a trace\r\nof mountain-mist. But on the opposite side, looking into the crater,\r\nnothing but blackness is to be seen. As hour succeeds hour, the sunbeams\r\nreach peak after peak of the circular rampart in slow succession, till\r\nat length the circle is complete and the vast crater-rim, 50 miles in\r\ndiameter, glistens like a silver-margined abyss of darkness. By-and-by,\r\nin the centre, appears a group of bright peaks or bosses. These are the\r\nnow illuminated summits of the central cones, and the development of the\r\ngreat mountain cluster they form henceforth becomes an imposing feature\r\nof the scene. From our high standpoint, and looking backwards to the\r\nsunny side of our cosmorama, we glance over a vast region of the wildest\r\nvolcanic desolation. Craters from five miles diameter downwards crowd\r\ntogether in countless numbers, so that the surface, as far as the eye\r\ncan reach, looks veritably frothed over with them. Nearer the base of\r\nthe rampart on which we stand, extensive mountain chains run to north\r\nand to south, casting long shadows towards us; and away to southward run\r\nseveral great chasms a mile wide and of appalling blackness and depth.\r\nNearer still, almost beneath us, crag rises on crag and precipice upon\r\nprecipice, mingled with craters and yawning pits, towering pinnacles of\r\nrock and piles of scoria and volcanic _débris_. But we behold no sign of\r\nexisting or vestige of past organic life. No heaths or mosses soften the\r\nsharp edges and hard surfaces: no tints of cryptogamous or lichenous\r\nvegetation give a complexion of life to the hard fire-worn countenance\r\nof the scene. The whole landscape, as far as the eye can reach, is a\r\nrealization of a fearful dream of desolation and lifelessness—not a\r\ndream of death, for that implies evidence of preexisting life, but a\r\nvision of a world upon which the light of life has never dawned.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XXII.\r\n    ASPECT OF AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN BY THE EARTH, AS IT WOULD APPEAR AS\r\n    SEEN FROM THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nLooking again, after some hours’ interval, into the great crateral\r\namphitheatre, we see that the rays of the morning sun have crept down\r\nthe distant side of the rampart, opposite to that on which we stand, and\r\nlighted up its vast landslipped terraces into a series of seeming\r\nhill-circles with all the rude and rugged features of a terrestrial\r\nmountain view, and none of the beauties save those of desolate grandeur.\r\nThe plateau of the crater is half in shadow 10,000 feet below, with its\r\ngrand group of cones, now fully in sight, rising from its centre.\r\nAlthough these last are twenty miles away and the base of the opposite\r\nrampart fully double that distance, we have no means of judging their\r\nremoteness, for in the absence of an atmosphere there can be no aërial\r\nperspective, and distant objects appear as brilliant and distinct as\r\nthose which are close to the observer. Not the brightness only, but the\r\nvarious colours also of the distant objects are preserved in their full\r\nintensity; for colour we may fairly assume there must be. Mineral\r\nchlorates and sublimates will give vivid tints to certain parts of the\r\nlandscape surface, and there must be all the more sombre colours which\r\nare common to mineral matters that have been subjected to fiery\r\ninfluence. All these tints will shine and glow with their greater or\r\nless intrinsic lustres, since they have not been deteriorated by\r\natmospheric agencies, and far and near they will appear clear alike,\r\nsince there is no aërial medium to veil them or tarnish their pristine\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\nIn the lunar landscape, in the line of sight, there are no means of\r\nestimating distances; only from an eminence, where the intervening\r\nground can be seen, is it possible to realize _magnitude_ in a lunar\r\ncosmorama and comprehend the dimensions of the objects it includes.\r\n\r\nAnd with no air there can be no diffusion of light. As a consequence, no\r\nillumination reaches those parts of the scene which do not receive the\r\ndirect solar rays, save the feeble amount reflected from contiguous\r\nilluminated objects, and a small quantity shed by the crescent earth.\r\nThe shadows have an awful blackness. As we stand upon our chosen point\r\nof observation, we see on the lighted side of the rampart almost\r\ndazzling brightness, while beneath us, on the side away from the sun,\r\nthere is a region many miles in area impenetrable to the sight, for\r\nthere is no object within it receiving sufficient light to render it\r\ndiscernible; and all around us, far and near, there is the violent\r\ncontrast between intense brightness of insolated parts and deep gloom of\r\nthose in equally intense shadow. The black though starlit sky helps the\r\nviolence of this contrast, for the bright mountains in the distance\r\naround us stand forth upon a background formed by the darkness of\r\ninterplanetary space. The visible effects of these conditions must be in\r\nevery sense unearthly and truly terrible. The hard, harsh glowing light\r\nand pitchy shadows; the absence of all the conditions that give\r\ntenderness to an earthly landscape; the black noonday sky, with the\r\nglaring sun ghastly in its brightness; the entire absence of vestiges of\r\nany life save that of the long since expired volcanoes—all these\r\nconspire to make up a scene of dreary, desolate grandeur that is\r\nscarcely conceivable by an earthly habitant, and that the description we\r\nhave attempted but insufficiently pourtrays.\r\n\r\nA legitimate extension of the imagination leads us to impressions of\r\nlunar conditions upon other senses than that of sight, to which we have\r\nhitherto confined our fancy. We are met at the outset with a difficulty\r\nin this extension; for it is impossible to conceive the sensations which\r\nthe absence of an atmosphere would produce upon the most important of\r\nour bodily functions. If we would attempt the task we must conjure up\r\nfeelings of suffocation, of which the thoughts are, however, too\r\nhorrible to be dwelt upon; we must therefore maintain the delusion that\r\nwe can exist without air, and attempt to realize some of the less\r\ndiscomforting effects of the absence of this medium. Most notable among\r\nthese are the untempered heat of the direct solar rays, and the\r\ninfluence thereof upon the surface material upon which we suppose\r\nourselves to stand. During a period of over three hundred hours the sun\r\npours down his beams with unmitigated ferocity upon a soil never\r\nsheltered by a cloud or cooled by a shower, till that soil is heated, as\r\nwe have shown, to a temperature equal nearly to that of melting lead;\r\nand this scorching influence is felt by everything upon which the sun\r\nshines on the lunar globe. But while regions directly insolated are thus\r\nheated, those parts turned from the sun would remain intensely cold, and\r\nthat scorching in sunshine and freezing in shade with which mountaineers\r\non the earth are familiar would be experienced in a terribly exaggerated\r\ndegree. Among the consequences, already alluded to, of the alternations\r\nof temperature to which the moon’s crust is thus exposed, are doubtless\r\nmore or less considerable expansions and contractions of the surface\r\nmaterial, and we may conceive that a cracking and crumbling of the more\r\nbrittle constituents would ensue, together with a grating of contiguous\r\nbut disconnected masses, and an occasional dislocation of them. We refer\r\nagain to these phenomena to remark that if an atmospheric medium existed\r\nthey would be attended with noisy manifestations. There are abundant\r\ncauses for grating and crackling sounds, and such are the only sources\r\nof noise upon the moon, where there is no life to raise a hum, no wind\r\nto murmur, no ocean to boom and foam, and no brook to plash. Yet even\r\nthese crust-cracking commotions, though they might be felt by the\r\nvibrations of the ground, would not manifest themselves audibly, for\r\nwithout air there can be no communication between the grating or\r\ncracking body and the nerves of hearing. Dead silence reigns on the\r\nmoon: a thousand cannons might be fired and a thousand drums beaten upon\r\nthat airless world, but no sound could come from them: lips might quiver\r\nand tongues essay to speak, but no action of theirs could break the\r\nutter silence of the lunar scene.\r\n\r\nAt a rate twenty-eight times slower than upon earth, the shadows shorten\r\ntill the sun attains his meridian height, and then, from the tropical\r\nregion upon which we have in imagination stood, nothing is to be seen on\r\nany side, save towards the black sky, but dazzling light. The relief of\r\nafternoon shadow comes but tardily, and the darkness drags its slow\r\nlength along the valleys and creeps sluggishly up the mountain-sides\r\ntill, in a hundred hours or more, the time of sunset approaches. This\r\nphenomenon is but daybreak reversed, and is unaccompanied by any of the\r\ngorgeous sky tints that make the kindred event so enrapturing on earth.\r\nThe sun declines towards the dark horizon without losing one jot of its\r\nbrilliancy, and darts the full intensity of its heat upon all it shines\r\non to the last. Its disc touches the horizon, and in half an hour dips\r\nhalf-way beneath it, its intrinsic brightness and colour remaining\r\nunchanged. The brief interval of twilight occurs, as in the morning,\r\nwhen only a small chord of the disc is visible, and the long shadows now\r\nsharpen as the area of light that casts them decreases. For a while the\r\nzodiacal light vies with the earth-moon high in the heavens in\r\nilluminating the scene; but in a few hours this solar appendage passes\r\nout of view, and our world becomes the queen of the lunar night.\r\n\r\nAt this sunset time the earth, nearly in the zenith of us, will be at\r\nits half-illuminated phase, and even then it will shed more light than\r\nwe receive upon the brightest of moonlight nights. As the night\r\nproceeds, the earth-phase will increase through the gibbous stages until\r\nat midnight it will be “full,” and our orb will be seen in its entire\r\nbeauty. It will perform at least one of its twenty-four-hourly rotations\r\nduring the time that it appears quite full, and the whole of its surface\r\nfeatures will in that time pass before the lunar spectator’s eye. At\r\ntimes the northern pole will be turned towards our view, at times the\r\nsouthern; and its polar ice-caps will appear as bright white spots,\r\nmarking its axis of rotation. If our lunar sojourn were prolonged we\r\nshould observe the northern ice-cap creep downwards to lower latitudes\r\n(during our winter) and retreat again (during our summer); and this\r\nvariation would be perceptible in a less degree at the southern pole, on\r\naccount of the watery area surrounding it. The seas would appear (so far\r\nas can be inferred) of pale blue-green tint; the continents\r\nparti-coloured: and the tinted spots would vary with the changing\r\nterrestrial seasons, as these are indicated by the positions and\r\nmagnitudes of the polar ice-caps. The permanent markings would be ever\r\nundergoing apparent modification by the variations of the white\r\ncloud-belts that encircle the terrestrial sphere. Of the nature of these\r\nvariations meteorological science is not as yet in a position to speak:\r\nit would indeed be vastly to the benefit of that science if a view of\r\nthe distribution of clouds and vapours over the earth’s surface, as\r\ncomprehensive as that we are imagining, could really be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt might happen at “full-earth,” that a black spot with a fainter\r\npenumbral fringe would appear on one side of the illuminated disc and\r\npass somewhat rapidly across it. This would occur when the moon passed\r\nexactly between the sun and the earth, and the shadow of the moon was\r\ncast upon the terrestrial disc. We need hardly say that these\r\nshadow-transits would occur upon those astronomically important\r\noccasions when an eclipse of the sun is beheld from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe other features of the sky during the long lunar night would not\r\ndiffer greatly from those to which we alluded in speaking of its day\r\naspects. The stars would be the more brightly visible, from the greater\r\npower of the eye-pupil to open in the absence of the glaring sun, and on\r\nthis account the milky-way would be very conspicuous and the brighter\r\nnebulæ would come into view. The constellations would mark the night by\r\ntheir positions, or the hours might be told off (in periods of\r\ntwenty-four each) by the successive reappearances of surface features on\r\ncertain parts of the terrestrial disc. The planets in opposition to the\r\nsun would now be seen, and a comet might appear to vary the monotony of\r\nthe long lunar night. But a meteor would never flash across the sky,\r\nthough dark meteoric particles and masses would continually bombard the\r\nlunar surface, sometimes singly, sometimes in showers. And these would\r\nfall with a compound force due to their initial velocity added to that\r\nof the moon’s attraction. As there is no atmosphere to consume the\r\nmeteors by frictional heat or break by its resistance the velocity of\r\ntheir descent, they must strike the moon with a force to which that of a\r\ncannon-ball striking a target is feeble indeed. A position on the moon\r\nwould be an unenviable stand-point from this cause alone.\r\n\r\nThe lunar landscape by night needs little description: it would be lit\r\nby the earth-moon sufficiently to allow salient features, even at a\r\ndistance, to be easily made out, for its moon (_i.e._ the earth) has\r\nthirteen times the light-reflecting area that our’s has. But the night\r\nillumination will change in intensity, since the earth-moon varies from\r\nhalf-full to full, and again to half-full, between sunset and the next\r\nsunrise. The direction of the light, and hence the positions of the\r\nshadows, will scarcely alter on account of the apparent fixity of the\r\nearth in the lunar sky. A slight degree of warmth might possibly be felt\r\nwith the reflected earth-light; but it would be insufficient to mollify\r\nthe intensity of the prevailing cold. The heat accumulated by the ground\r\nduring the three hundred hours’ sunshine radiates rapidly into space,\r\nthere being no atmospheric coat to retain it, and a cooling process\r\nensues that goes on till, all warmth having rapidly departed, the\r\npreviously parched soil assumes a temperature approaching that of\r\ncelestial space itself, and which has been, as we have stated, estimated\r\nat about 200° below the Fahrenheit zero. If moisture existed upon the\r\nmoon, its night-side would be bound in a grip of frost to which our\r\nArctic regions would be comparatively tropical. But since there is no\r\nwater, the aspect of the lunar scenery remains unmodified by effects of\r\nchanging temperature.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the most prominent effects that would manifest\r\nthemselves to the visual and other senses of a being transported to the\r\nmoon. The picture is not on the whole a pleasant one, but it is\r\ninstructive; and our rendering of it, imperfect though it be, may serve\r\nto suggest other inferences that cannot but add to the interest which\r\nalways attaches to the contemplation of natural scenes and phenomena\r\nfrom points of view different from those which we ordinarily occupy.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE XXIII.\r\n    GROUP of LUNAR MOUNTAINS. ideal lunar landscape.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n      THE MOON AS A SATELLITE: ITS RELATION TO THE EARTH AND MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the recondite functions of the moon considered as one of the\r\ninterdependent members of the solar family, into which it would be\r\nbeyond our purpose to inquire, there are certain means by which it\r\nsubserves human interests and ministers to the wants of civilized man to\r\nwhich we deem it desirable to call attention, especially as some of them\r\nare not so self-apparent as to have attracted popular attention.\r\n\r\nThe most generally appreciated because the most evident of the uses of\r\nthe moon is that of a luminary. Popular regard for it is usually\r\nconfined to its service in that character, and in that character poets\r\nand painters have never tired in their efforts to glorify it. And\r\nobviously this service as a “lesser light” is sufficiently prominent to\r\nexcite our warmest admiration. But moonlight is, from the very\r\nconditions of its production, of such a changeable and fugitive nature,\r\nand it affords after all so partial and imperfect an alleviation of\r\nnight’s darkness, that we are fain to regard the light-giving office of\r\nthe moon as one of secondary importance. Far more valuable to mankind in\r\ngeneral, so estimable as to lead us to place it foremost in our category\r\nof lunar offices, is the duty which the moon performs in the character\r\nof a sanitary agent. We can conceive no direful consequences that would\r\nfollow from a withdrawal of the moon’s mere light; but it is easy to\r\nimagine what highly dangerous results would ensue if the moon ceased to\r\nproduce the tides of the ocean. Motion and activity in the elements of\r\nthe terraqueous globe appear to be among the prime conditions in\r\ncreation. Rest and stagnation are fraught with mischief. While the sun\r\nkeeps the atmosphere in constant and healthy circulation through the\r\nagency of the winds, the moon performs an analogous service to the\r\nwaters of the sea and the rivers that flow into them. It is as the chief\r\nproducer of the tides—for we must not forget that the sun exercises\r\n_its_ tidal influences, though in much lesser degree—that we ought to\r\nplace the highest value on the services of the moon: but for its aid as\r\na mighty scavenger, our shores, where rivers terminate, would become\r\nstagnant deltas of fatal corruption. Twice (to speak generally) a day,\r\nhowever, the organic matter which rivers deposit in a decomposing state\r\nat their embouchures is swept away by the tidal wave; and thus, thanks\r\nto the moon, a source of direful pestilence is prevented from arising.\r\nRivers themselves are providentially cleansed by the same means, where\r\nthey are polluted by bordering towns and cities which, from the nature\r\nof things, are sure to arise on river banks; and it seems to be also in\r\nthe nature of things that the river traversing a city must become its\r\nmain sewer. The foul additions may be carried down by the stream in its\r\nnatural course towards the ocean, but where the river is large there\r\nwill be a decrease in velocity of the current near the mouth or where it\r\njoins the sea, thus causing partial stagnation and consequent deposition\r\nof the deleterient matters. All this, however, is removed, and its\r\ninconceivable evils are averted by our mighty and ever active “sanitary\r\ncommissioner,” the moon. We can scarcely doubt that a healthy influence\r\nof less obvious degree is exerted in the wide ocean itself; but,\r\nconsidering merely human interests, we cannot suppress the conviction\r\nthat man is more widely and immediately benefited by this purifying\r\noffice of the moon than by any other.\r\n\r\nBut the sanitary service is not the only one that the moon performs\r\nthrough the agency of the tides. There is the work of tidal transport to\r\nbe considered. Upon tidal rivers and on certain coasts, notwithstanding\r\nwind and the use of steam, a very large proportion of the heavy\r\nmerchandize is transported by that slow but powerful “tug” the\r\nflood-tide; and a similar service, for which, however, the moon is not\r\nto be entirely credited, is done by the down-flow of the ebb-tide. Large\r\nships and heavily-laden rafts and barges are quietly taken in tow by\r\nthis unobtrusive prime mover, and moved from the river’s mouth to the\r\nfar-up city, and from wharf to wharf along its banks; and a vast amount\r\nof mechanical work is thus gratuitously performed which, if it had to be\r\nprovided by artificial means, would represent an amount of money value\r\nwhich for such a city as London would have to be counted by thousands,\r\npossibly millions, of pounds yearly. For this service we owe the moon\r\nthe gratitude that we ought to feel for a direct pecuniary benefactor.\r\n\r\nIn the existing state of civilization and prosperity, we do not,\r\nhowever, utilize the power of the tides nearly to the extent of their\r\ncapabilities. Our coal mines, rich with “the light of other days”—for\r\ncoal was long ago declared by Stevenson to be “bottled sunshine”—at\r\npresent furnish us with so abundant a supply of power-generating\r\nmaterial that in our eagerness to use it upon all possible occasions we\r\nare losing sight, or putting out of mind, many other valuable prime\r\nmovers, and amongst them that of the rise and fall of the waters, which\r\ncan be immediately converted into any form of mechanical power by the\r\naid of tide-mills. Such mills may be found in existence here and there,\r\nbut for the present they are generally out-rivalled by the steam-engine\r\nwith all its conveniences and adaptabilities; and hence they have not\r\nshared the benefits of that inventive ingenuity which has achieved such\r\nwonders of mechanical appliance while steam has been in the ascendant.\r\nBut it must be remembered that in our extravagant use of coal we are\r\ndrawing from a bank into which nothing is being paid. We are consuming\r\nan exhaustive store, and the time must come when it will be needful to\r\nlook around in quest of “powers that may be.” Then an impetus may be\r\ngiven to the application of the tides to mechanical purposes as a prime\r\nmover.[19] For the people of the British Islands the problem would have\r\nan especial importance, viewing the extent of our seaboard and the\r\nnumber of our tidal rivers. The source of motion that offers itself is\r\nof almost incalculable extent. There is not merely the onward flowing\r\nmotion of streams to be utilized, but also the _lift_ of water, which,\r\nif small in extent, is stupendous in amount; and within certain limits\r\nit matters little to the mechanician whether the “foot-pounds” of work\r\nplaced at his disposal are in the form of a great mass lifted to a small\r\nheight or a small mass lifted to a great height. There is no reason\r\neither why the utilization of the tides should be confined to rivers.\r\nThe sea-side might well become the circle of manufacturing industry, and\r\nthe millions of tons of water lifted several feet twice daily on our\r\nshores might be converted, even by schemes already proposed, to furnish\r\nthe prime movement of thousands of factories. And we must not forget how\r\ncompletely modern science has demonstrated the inter-convertibility of\r\nall kinds of force, and thus opened the way for the introduction of\r\nsystems of transporting power that, in such a state of things as we are\r\nfor the moment considering, might be of immense benefit. Gravity, for\r\ninstance, can be converted into electricity; and electricity gives us\r\nthat wonderful power of transmitting _force_ without transmitting (or\r\neven moving) _matter_, which power we use in the telegraph, where we\r\ngenerate a force at one end of a wire and _use_ it to ring bells or\r\ndeflect needles at the other end, which may be thousands of miles away.\r\nWhat we do with the slight amount of force needful for telegraphy is\r\ncapable of being done with any greater amount. A tide-mill might convert\r\nits mechanical energy by an electro-magnetic engine, and in the form of\r\nelectricity its force could be conveyed inland by proper wires and there\r\nreconverted back to mechanical or moving power. True, there would be a\r\nconsiderable loss of power, but that power would cost nothing for its\r\nfirst production. Another means ready to hand for transporting power is\r\nby compressed air, which has already done good service; another is the\r\nsystem so admirably worked out by Sir W. Armstrong, of transmitting\r\nwater-power through the agency of an “accumulator,” now so generally\r\nused at our Docks and elsewhere, for working cranes and such other uses.\r\nAnd as the whole duty of the engineer is to _convert_ the forces of\r\nnature, there is a rich field open for his invention, and upon which he\r\nmay one day have to enter, in adapting the pulling force of the moon to\r\nhis fellow man’s mechanical wants through the intermediation of the\r\ntides.\r\n\r\nAnother of the high functions of the moon is that by which she subserves\r\nthe wants of the navigator, and enables him to track his course over the\r\npathless ocean. Of the two co-ordinates, Latitude and Longitude, that\r\nare needful to determine the position of a ship at sea (or of any\r\nstandpoint upon the earth’s surface) the first is easily found, inasmuch\r\nas it is always equal to the altitude of the celestial pole at the place\r\nof observation. But the determination of the longitude has always been a\r\ndifficult problem, and one upon which a vast amount of ingenuity has\r\nbeen expended. When it was first attacked it was soon discovered that\r\nthe moon was the object of all others by which it could be most\r\naccurately and, all things considered, most readily determined. We must\r\npremise that the longitude of one place from another is in effect the\r\ndifference between the local times at the two places, so that when we\r\nsay that a place or a ship is, for instance, seven hours, twenty-four\r\nminutes, ten seconds, west of Greenwich, we mean that the time-o’-day at\r\nthe place or ship is seven hours twenty-four minutes ten seconds earlier\r\nthan that at Greenwich. Hence, finding the longitude at sea or at any\r\nplace and moment means finding what time it is at Greenwich at that\r\nmoment. Of course this could be most easily done if we could set a\r\ntimekeeper at Greenwich and rely upon its keeping time during a long sea\r\nvoyage; and this plan appeared so feasible that our Government long ago\r\noffered a prize of £20,000 for a timekeeper which would perform to a\r\nstated degree of accuracy after a certain sea voyage. One John Harrison\r\ndid make such a timekeeper, that actually satisfied the conditions, and\r\nobtained the prize: and chronometers are now largely used for longitude,\r\ntheir construction having been brought to great perfection, especially\r\nin England, owing to a continuance (in a less liberal degree, however,)\r\nof Government inducement. But chronometers are not entirely to be relied\r\non, even where several are carried, which in other than Government ships\r\nis rarely the case: recourse must be had to the heavenly bodies for\r\ncheck upon the timekeeper. And the moon is, as we have said, the body\r\nthat best serves the requirements of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe lunar method for longitude amounts practically to this. The stars\r\nare fixed; the sun, moon, and planets move amongst them; the sun and\r\nplanets with very slow rates of apparent motion, the moon with a very\r\nrapid one. If, then, it be predicted that at a certain instant of\r\nGreenwich time the moon will be a certain distance from a fixed star,\r\nand if the mariner at sea observes _when_ the moon has that exact\r\ndistance, he will know the Greenwich time at the instant of his\r\nobservation.[20] The moon thus becomes to him as the hand of a\r\ntimepiece, whereof the stars are the hour and minute marks, the whole\r\nbeing, as it were, set to Greenwich time. Then if he knows (which he\r\ndoes by other observations easily obtained) the local time at his ship,\r\nhe can take the difference between the Greenwich time and his time,\r\nwhich difference is in fact his longitude from Greenwich. The requisite\r\npredictions of the distance of the moon from several fixed stars near\r\nher are given to the utmost exactness for every three hours of every day\r\nand night (when the moon can possibly be seen) in the navigator’s _vade\r\nmecum_, the “Nautical Almanac,” and from these given distances the\r\nnavigator can, by a simple process of differencing, obtain the distance,\r\nand hence the Greenwich time, for any intermediate instant at which he\r\nmay chance to make his observation. Whenever he can see the moon he can\r\nobtain Greenwich time. Of course the whole value of this method depends\r\nupon the exactitude of the predicted distances corresponding to the\r\ngiven Greenwich times. These distances are obtained by tables of the\r\nmoon’s motions, which must be found from observations. The motions in\r\nquestion are of an intricacy almost past comprehension, on account of\r\nthe disturbing forces to which the moon is subjected by the sun and\r\nplanets. The powers of the profoundest mathematicians, from Newton\r\ndownwards, have been severely exercised in efforts to group them into a\r\ntheory, and represent them by tables capable of furnishing the requisite\r\nexact predictions of lunar positions for nautical purposes. Accurate\r\nobservations of the moon’s place night after night have, from the dawn\r\nof this lunar method for longitude, been in urgent request by\r\nmathematicians for the purposes specified, and it was solely to procure\r\nthese observations that the Observatory at Greenwich was established,\r\nand mainly for their continued prosecution (and for the stellar\r\nobservations necessary for their utilization) that it is sustained. For\r\ntwo centuries the moon has been unremittingly observed at Greenwich, and\r\nthe tables at present used for making the “Nautical Almanac” (those\r\nformed by Prof. Hansen) depend upon the observations there obtained. The\r\nwork still goes on, for even now the degree of exactitude is not what is\r\ndesired, and astronomers are looking forward with some interest to new\r\nlunar tables which were left complete by the late M. Delaunay, formerly\r\nthe head of astronomy in France, based upon a theory which he evolved.\r\nThis use of the moon is the grandest of all in respect of the results to\r\nwhich it has led.\r\n\r\nThen, too, regarding the moon as a timekeeper, we must not forget the\r\nservice that it renders in furnishing a division of time intermediate\r\nbetween the day—which is measured by the earth’s rotation—and the year,\r\nwhich is defined by the earth’s orbital revolution. Notwithstanding the\r\nsurvival of lunar reckoning in our religious services, we, in our time\r\nand country, scarcely need a moon to mark our months; but we must not\r\nforget that with many ancient people the moon was, and with some is\r\nstill, the chief timekeeper, the calendars of such people being lunar\r\nones, and all their events being reckoned and dated by “moons.” To us,\r\nhowever, the moon is of great service in this department by enabling us\r\nto fix dates to many historical events, the times of occurrence of which\r\nare uncertain, by reason of defective records or by dependence upon such\r\nuncertain data as “lives of emperors,” years of this or that king’s\r\nreign, or generations of one or another family. The moon now and then\r\nclears up a mystery, or decides a disputed point in chronology, by\r\nfurnishing the accurate date of an ancient eclipse, which was a\r\nphenomenon that always inspired awe and secured for itself careful\r\nrecord. The chronologer is continually applying to the astronomer for\r\nthe date and place of visibility of some total eclipse, of which he has\r\nfound an imperfect record, veritable as to the fact, but dated only by\r\nreference to some year of a so-and-so’s reign, or by some battle or\r\nother historical occurrence. The eclipses that occurred near the time\r\nare then examined, and when one is found that tallies with recorded\r\nconditions in other respects (such as the time of day and the place of\r\nobservation), its indisputable date becomes a starting-point from which\r\nthe chronologer works backwards and forwards in safety. There is one\r\nfamous eclipse—that predicted by Thales six centuries before Christ,\r\nwhich put an end to the battle between the Medes and Lydians by the\r\nterror its darkness created in both armies—which is most intimately\r\nassociated with ancient chronology, and has been used to rectify a\r\nproximate date (the first year of Cyrus of Babylon) which forms the\r\nfoundation of all Scripture chronology. Sacred and profane history alike\r\nare continually receiving assistance from the accurate dates which the\r\nmoon, by having caused eclipses of the sun, enables the astronomer to\r\nfix beyond cavil or doubt.\r\n\r\nThe mention of eclipses reminds us, too, of the use which the moon has\r\nbeen in increasing, through them, our knowledge of the physical\r\ncondition of the sun. If the moon had never intervened to cut off the\r\nblinding glare of the solar disc, we should have been to this day left\r\nto assume that the sun is all-contained by the dazzling globe that we\r\nordinarily see. But, thanks to the moon’s intervention, we now know that\r\nthe sun is by no means the mere naked sphere we should have suspected.\r\nEclipses have taught us that it is surrounded by an envelope of glowing\r\ngases, and that it has a vast vaporous surrounding, beyond its glowing\r\natmosphere, which appears to be composed of matter streaming away from\r\nthe sun into surrounding space. With these discoveries still in their\r\ninfancy, it is impossible to foresee the knowledge to which they will\r\neventually lead, but they can hardly be barren of fruit, and whatever\r\nthey ultimately teach will be so much insight gained into the sublimest\r\nproblem that human science has before it—the determination of the source\r\nand maintaining power of the light and heat and vivifying agency of the\r\nsun. In according our thankful reflections to the moon for these\r\nrevelations, we must not forget that, should there be inhabitants upon\r\nour neighbouring worlds, Mercury, Venus, and Mars, which have no\r\nsatellites, they, the supposed inhabitants, can gain no such knowledge\r\nupon the surroundings of the ruler of the solar system. On the other\r\nhand, any rational being who may be supposed to dwell upon Saturn or\r\nJupiter, would, through the intervention of their numerous moons, have,\r\nin the latter case especially, far more abundant opportunities of\r\nacquiring the knowledge in question than we have.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a use of the moon which touches us, author and reader,\r\nvery closely. It has taught us of a world in a condition totally\r\ndifferent from our own; of a planet without water, without air, without\r\nthe essentials to life development, but rather with the conditions for\r\nlife destruction; a planet left by the Creator—for wise purposes that we\r\ncannot fully know—as it were but half-formed, with all the igneous\r\nfoundations fresh from the cosmical fire, and with its rough-cast\r\nsurface in its original state, its fire and mould-marks exposed to our\r\nview. From these we have essayed to resolve some of the processes of\r\nformation, and thus to learn something of the cosmical agencies that are\r\ncalled forth in the purely igneous era of a planet’s history. We trust\r\nthat we, on our part, have shown that the study of the moon may be a\r\nbenefit not merely to the astronomer, but to the geologist; for we\r\nbehold in it a mighty “medal of creation” doubtless formed of the same\r\nmaterial and struck with the same die that moulded our earth; but while\r\nthe dust of countless ages and the action of powerful disintegrating and\r\ndenuding elements have eroded and obliterated the earthly impression,\r\nthe superscriptions on the lunar surface have remained with their\r\npristine clearness unsullied, every vestige sharp and bright as when it\r\nleft the Almighty Maker’s hands. The moon serves no second-rate or\r\ninsignificant service when it teaches us of the variety of creative\r\ndesign in the worlds of our system, and exalts our estimation of this\r\npeopled globe of ours by showing us that all the planetary worlds have\r\n_not_ been deemed worthy to become the habitations of intelligent\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\n\r\nReflections upon the uses of the moon not unnaturally lead our thoughts\r\nto some matters that may be regarded as abuses. These mainly take the\r\nform of superstitions, erroneous beliefs in the moon’s influence over\r\nterrestrial conditions, and occasionally of erroneous ideas upon the\r\nmoon’s functions as a luminary. The first-mentioned are almost beneath\r\nnotice, for they include such mythical suspicions as that the moon\r\ninfluences human sanity and other affections of mind and body; that the\r\nmoon’s rays have a decomposing effect upon organic matter; that they\r\nproduce blindness by shining upon a sleeper’s eyes; that the moon\r\ndetermines the hours of human death, which is supposed to occur with the\r\nchange of the tide, etc. All such, having no foundation on fact, are put\r\nbeyond our consideration. The third matter we have mentioned may also be\r\ndismissed in a very few words. The erroneous ideas upon the moon’s\r\nfunctions as a luminary, to which we allude, are those which are\r\nmanifested by poets and painters, and even historians, who do not\r\nhesitate to bring the moon upon a scene in any form and at any time they\r\nplease without reference to actual lunar circumstances. It is no\r\nuncommon thing to see, in a picture representing an evening scene, a\r\nmoon introduced which can only be seen in the morning—a waning moon\r\ninstead of a waxing one; and astronomical critics have, indeed, caught\r\nartists so far tripping as to put a moon in a picture representing some\r\nevent that occurred upon a date when the moon was new, and therefore\r\ninvisible. Writers take the same liberties very frequently. A newspaper\r\ncorrespondent, during the Franco-Prussian war, described the full moon\r\nas shining upon a scene of desolation on a particular night, when really\r\nthere was no moon to be seen. One of the most flagrant cases of this\r\nkind, however, occurs in Wolfe’s ballad on “The death of Sir John\r\nMoore,” where it is written that the hero was buried “By the struggling\r\nmoonbeam’s misty light.” But the interment actually took place at a time\r\nwhen the moon was out of sight. We mention these abuses of the moon in\r\nthe hope of promoting a better observance of the moon’s luminary office.\r\nThey who wish to bring the moon upon a scene, not knowing _ipso facto_\r\nthat it was there, should first take the advice of Nick Bottom in the\r\n“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and make sure of their object by consulting\r\nan almanac.\r\n\r\nThe second of the specified abuses to which the moon is subject refers\r\nto its supposed influence on the weather; and in the extent to which it\r\ngoes this is one of the most deeply rooted of popular errors. That there\r\nis an infinitesimal influence exerted by the moon on our atmosphere will\r\nbe seen from the evidence we have to offer, but it is of a character and\r\nextent vastly different from what is commonly believed. The popular\r\nerror is shown in its most absurd form when the mere _aspect_ of the\r\nmoon, the mere transition from one phase of illumination to another, is\r\nasserted to be productive of a change of weather; as if the gradual\r\npassage from first quarter to second quarter, or from that to third,\r\ncould of itself upset an existing condition of the atmosphere; or as if\r\nthe conjunction of the moon with the sun could invert the order of the\r\nwinds, generate clouds, and pour down rains. A moment’s reasoning ought\r\nto show that the supposed cause and the observed effect have no\r\nnecessary connection. In our climate the weather may be said to change\r\nat least every three days, and the moon changes—to retain the popular\r\nterm—every seven days; so that the probability of a coincidence of these\r\nchanges is very great indeed: when it occurs, the moon is sure to be\r\ncredited with causing it. But a theory of this kind is of no use unless\r\nit can be shown to apply in every case; and, moreover, the change must\r\nalways be in the same direction: to suppose that the moon can turn a\r\nfine day to a wet one, and a wet day to a fine morrow indiscriminately,\r\nis to make our satellite blow hot and cold with the same mouth, and so\r\nto reduce the supposition to an absurdity. If any marked connection\r\nexisted between the state of the air and the aspect of the moon, it must\r\ninevitably have forced itself unsought upon the attention of\r\nmeteorologists. In the weekly return of Births, Deaths, and Marriages,\r\nissued by the Registrar-General, a table is given, showing all the\r\nmeteorological elements at Greenwich for every day of the year, and a\r\ncolumn is set apart for noting the changes and positions of the moon.\r\nThese reports extend backwards nearly a quarter of a century. Here,\r\nthen, is a repertory of data that ought to reveal at a glance any such\r\nconnection, and would certainly have done so had it existed. But no\r\nconstant relation between the moon columns and those containing the\r\ninstrument readings has ever been traced. Our meteorological\r\nobservatories furnish continuous and unbroken records of atmospheric\r\nvariations, extending over long series of years: these afford still more\r\nabundant means for testing the validity of the lunar hypothesis. The\r\ncollation has frequently been made for special points in the inquiry,\r\nand certainly _some_ connection has been found to obtain between certain\r\npositions of the moon in her orbit and certain instrumental averages;\r\nbut so small are the effects traceable to lunar influence, that they are\r\nalmost inappreciable among the grosser irregularities that arise from\r\nother and as yet unexplained causes.\r\n\r\nThe lunar influences upon our atmosphere most likely to be detected are\r\nthose of a tidal character, and those due to the radiation of the heat\r\nwhich the moon receives from the sun. The first would be shown by the\r\nbarometer, which may be called an “atmospheric tide gauge.” Some years\r\nago Sir Edward Sabine instituted a series of observations at St. Helena,\r\nto determine the variations of barometric indications from hour to hour\r\nof the lunar day. The greatest differences were found to occur between\r\nthe times when the moon was on the meridian, and when it was six hours\r\naway from the meridian; in other words, between atmospheric high tide\r\nand low tide. But the average of these differences amounted only to the\r\nfour-hundredth part of an inch on the instrument’s scale; a quantity\r\nthat no weather observer would heed, that none but the best barometers\r\nwould show, and that can have no perceptible effect on weather changes.\r\nThe distance of the moon from the earth varies, as is well known, in\r\nconsequence of the elliptical form of her orbit: this variation ought\r\nalso to produce an effect upon the instrument’s indications; but Colonel\r\nSabine’s analysis showed that it was next to insensible; the mean\r\nreading at apogee differing from that at perigee by only the\r\ntwo-thousandth part of an inch. Schubler, a German meteorologist, had\r\narrived at similarly negative results some years previously. Hence it\r\nappears that the great index of the weather is not sensibly affected by\r\nthe state of the moon: the conclusion to be drawn with regard to the\r\nweather itself is obvious enough. As regards the heat received from the\r\nmoon, we know, from the recent experiments of Lord Rosse in England, and\r\nMarie Davy in France, elsewhere alluded to, that a degree of warmth\r\nappreciable to the highly sensitive thermopile is exerted by the moon\r\nupon the earth near to the time of full moon, when the sun’s rays have\r\nbeen pouring their unmitigated heat upon the lunar surface continuously\r\nfor fourteen days. And as it is improbable that the whole of the heat\r\nsent earthwards from the moon reaches the earth’s surface, we must infer\r\nthat a considerable amount is absorbed in the higher atmosphere, and\r\ndoes work in evaporating the lighter clouds and thinning the denser\r\nones. The effect of this upon the earth is to facilitate the radiation\r\nof its heat into space, and so to cool the lower atmospheric strata. And\r\nthis effect has been shown to be a veritable one by an exhaustive\r\ntabulation of temperature records from various observatories, which was\r\nundertaken by Mr. Park Harrison. The general conclusion from these was,\r\nthat the temperature at the earth’s surface is lower by about 2½ degrees\r\nat moon’s last quarter than at first quarter; the paradoxical result\r\nbeing what would naturally follow from the foregoing consideration. The\r\ntendency of the full moon to clear the sky has been remarked by several\r\ndistinguished authorities, to wit, Sir John Herschel, Humboldt, and\r\nArago; and in general the clearing may be accepted as a meteorological\r\nfact, though in one case of close examination it has been negatived. It\r\ncannot be doubted that a full moon sometimes shows a night to be clear\r\nthat would in the absence of the moon be called cloudy.\r\n\r\nWhen close comparisons are made between the moon’s positions and records\r\nof rain-fall and wind-direction, dim indications of relation exhibit\r\nthemselves, which may be the feeble consequences of the change of\r\ntemperature just spoken of; but in every case where an effect has been\r\ntraced it has been of the most insignificant kind, and no apparent\r\nconnexion has been recognized between one effect and another. Certainly\r\nthere is nothing that can support the extensive popular belief in lunar\r\ninfluence on weather, and nothing that can modify the conviction that\r\nthis belief as at present maintained is an absurd delusion. Yet its\r\nacceptance is so general, and runs through such varied grades of\r\nsociety, that we have felt it our duty to dwell upon it to the extent\r\nthat we have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n                          CONCLUDING SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the conclusion of our subject, it appears to us\r\ndesirable that we should recall to the reader, by a rapid review, its\r\nsalient features.\r\n\r\nOur main object being to attempt what we conceived to be a rational\r\nexplanation of the surface details of the moon which should be in\r\naccordance with the generally received theory of planetary formation,\r\nand with the peculiar physical conditions of the lunar globe—the opening\r\nof our work was a summary of the nebular hypothesis as it was started by\r\nthe first Herschel and systemised by Laplace. Following these\r\nphilosophers we endeavoured to show how a chaotic mass of primordial\r\nmatter existing in space would, under the action of gravitation, become\r\ntransformed into a system of planetary bodies circulating about a common\r\ncentre of gravity; and further, how, in some cases, the circulating\r\nplanetary masses would themselves become sub-centres of satellitic\r\nsystems; our earth being one of these sub-centres with only one\r\nsatellitic attendant—to wit, the moon, the subject of our study.\r\n\r\nThe moon being thus considered as evolved from the parent nebulous mass,\r\nand existing as an isolated and compact body, we had next to consider\r\nwhat was the effect of the continued action of the gravitating force. By\r\nthe light of the beautiful “mechanical theory of heat” we argued that\r\nthis force, not being _destructible_, but being _convertible_, was\r\nturned into heat; and that whatever may have been the original condition\r\nof the parent nebulous mass, as regards temperature, its planetary\r\noffspring became elevated to an intense degree of heat as they assumed\r\nthe form of spheres under the influence of gravitation.\r\n\r\nThe incandescent sphere having attained its maximum degree of heat by\r\nthe total conversion thereinto of the gravitating force it embodied, we\r\nexplained how there must have ensued a dispersion of that heat by\r\nradiation into surrounding space, resulting in the cooling and\r\nconsequent solidification of the outermost stratum of the lunar sphere,\r\nand subsequently in the continuation of the cooling process downwards or\r\ninwards to the centre. And here we essayed to prove that in this second\r\nstage of the cooling process, when the crust was solid and the subjacent\r\nportion of the molten sphere was about to solidify, there would come\r\ninto operation a principle which appears to govern the behaviour of\r\ncertain fusible substances, and which may be concisely termed the\r\nprinciple of pre-solidifying expansion. We adduced several examples of\r\nthe manifestation of this principle, soliciting for it the careful\r\nconsideration of physicists and geologists, and looking to it as\r\nfurnishing the key to the mystery of volcanic action upon the moon,\r\nsince, without needing recourse to aqueous or gaseous sources of\r\neruptive power, it afforded a rationale of the ejection of the fluid and\r\nsemifluid matter of the moon through the solidified crust thereof, and\r\nalso of the dislocations of that crust, unattended by actual ejection of\r\nsubsurface matter, of which our satellite presents a variety of\r\nexamples, and which the earth also appears to have experienced at some\r\nperiod of its formative history.\r\n\r\nArrived at this stage of our subject we thought it needful to introduce\r\nsome pages of data and descriptive detail. Accordingly in one chapter we\r\ndiscussed the form, magnitude, weight, and density of the moon, and the\r\nforce of gravity at its surface: and the more soundly to fix these data\r\nin the mind, we devoted a few lines to explanation of the methods\r\nwhereby each has been ascertained. We then examined the question (so\r\nimportant to our subject) of the existence or non-existence of a lunar\r\natmosphere, giving the evidence, which may be regarded as conclusive, in\r\nproof of the absence of both air and water from the moon, and,\r\ntherefore, refuting the claim of these elements to be considered as\r\nsources or influants of the moon’s volcanic manifestations. A general\r\n_coup-d’œil_ of the lunar hemisphere facing the earth next engaged our\r\nattention, and we considered the aspect of the disc as it is viewed by\r\nthe naked eye and with telescopes of various powers. From this general\r\nsurvey we passed to the topography of the moon, tracing briefly the\r\nadmirable labours of those who have advanced this subject, and, by aid\r\nof picture and skeleton maps and a table of position co-ordinates,\r\nplacing it within the reader’s power to become more than sufficiently\r\nacquainted for the purposes of this work with the names and positions of\r\ndetail objects and features of interest. Special descriptions of\r\ninteresting and typical spots and regions were given in some few cases\r\nwhere such appeared to be called for.\r\n\r\nThese descriptive matters disposed of, we proceeded to discuss the\r\nvarious classes of surface features with a view to explaining the\r\nprecise actions which appear to us to have led to their formation.\r\nNaturally the craters first demanded our attention. We pointed out the\r\nreasons for regarding the great majority of the circular formations of\r\nthe moon as craters, as truly volcanic as those of which we have\r\nexamples, modified by obvious causes, upon the earth; and, tracing the\r\ncausative phenomena of terrestrial volcanoes, we showed how the\r\nexplanations which have been offered to account for them scarcely apply\r\nto those of the moon: and thus, driven to other hypotheses, we\r\nendeavoured to demonstrate the probability of the lunar craters having\r\nbeen produced by eruptive force, generated by that pre-solidifying\r\nexpansion of successive portions of the moon’s molten interior, which we\r\nenunciated in our third chapter. The precise course of phenomena which\r\nresulted in the production of a crater of the normal lunar type, with or\r\nwithout the significant central cone, were then illustrated by a series\r\nof step-by-step diagrams with accompanying descriptive paragraphs. And\r\nafter treating of craters of the normal type we pointed out and\r\nexplained some variations thereupon that are here and there to be met\r\nwith, and likewise those curious complications of arrangement which\r\nexhibit craters superimposed one upon another and intermingled in\r\nstrange confusion.\r\n\r\nFrom craters manifestly volcanic we passed to the consideration of those\r\ncircular formations which, from their vastness of size, scarcely admit\r\nof satisfactory explanation by a volcanic hypothesis. We summarized\r\nseveral proffered theories of their origin, and pointed out what we\r\nconsidered might be a possible key to the solution of the selenological\r\nenigma which they constitute, without, however, expressing ourselves\r\nentirely satisfied with the validity of our suggestion. The less\r\nmysterious features presented by peaks and mountain ranges were then\r\ndiscussed to the extent that we considered requisite, viewing their\r\ncomparatively simple character and the secondary position they occupy in\r\npoint of numerical importance upon the moon. At greater length we dealt\r\nwith the cracks and chasms and the allied phenomena of radiating\r\nstreaks, pointing out with regard to these latter the strikingly\r\nbeautiful correspondence in effect (and therefore presumably in cause)\r\nbetween them and crack-systems of a glass globe “starred” by an\r\nexpanding internal medium.\r\n\r\nThe more notable objects and features of the lunar surface being\r\ndisposed of, we had next to say a few words upon some residual\r\nphenomena, chiefly upon the colour of lunar surface details, and upon\r\ntheir various degrees of brightness or reflective power. And, inasmuch\r\nas varying brightness seemed to us to be related to varying antiquity,\r\nwe were thence led to the question of the chronology of selenological\r\nformations, and to the disputation upon the continuance of volcanic\r\naction upon the moon in recent years. We regarded this question from the\r\nobservational and the inferential points of view, and were led to the\r\nconclusion that the moon’s surface arrived at its terminal condition\r\nages ago, and that it is next to hopeless to look for evidence of\r\nexisting change.\r\n\r\nThus far our work dealt with the moon as a planetary body merely. It\r\noccurred to us, however, that we might add to the interest attaching to\r\nour satellite were we to regard it for a time as a world, and consider\r\nits conditions as respects fitness for habitation by beings like\r\nourselves. The arguments against the possibility of the moon being thus\r\nfitted for human creatures, or, indeed, for any high organism, were\r\ndecisive enough to require little enforcing. It appeared to us,\r\nnevertheless, that much might be learnt by imagining one’s self located\r\nupon the moon during a period embracing one lunar day (a month of our\r\nreckoning), with power to comprehend the peculiar circumstances and\r\nconditions of such a situation. We therefore attempted a description of\r\nan imaginary sojourn upon the moon, and pointed out some of the more\r\nstriking aspects and phenomena which we know by legitimate inference\r\nwould be there manifested. We trust, that while our modest efforts in\r\nthe chapter referring to this branch of our subject may prove in some\r\ndegree entertaining, they may be in a greater degree instructive,\r\ninasmuch as certain facts are brought into prominence which would not\r\nunnaturally be overlooked in contemplating the moon from the earth, the\r\nonly _real_ stand-point that is available to us.\r\n\r\nIn our final chapter we considered the moon as a satellite, and sought\r\nto enhance popular regard for it on account of certain high functions\r\nwhich it performs for man’s benefit on this earth; but which are in\r\ngreat risk of being overlooked. We showed that, notwithstanding the\r\nmoon’s occasionally useful service as a nocturnal luminary, it fills a\r\nfar higher office as a sanitary agent by cleansing the shores of our\r\nseas and rivers through the agency of the tides. We pointed out the vast\r\namount of absolutely mechanical work and commercial labour which the\r\nsame tidal agency executes in transporting merchandize up and down our\r\nrivers—an amount that, to take the port of London alone, represents a\r\nmoney value _per annum_ that may be reckoned in millions sterling,\r\nseeing that if our river was tideless all transport would have to be\r\ndone by manual or steam power. We then hinted at the stupendous\r\nreservoir of power that the tidal waters constitute, a form of power\r\nwhich has not as yet been sufficiently called into operation, but which\r\nmay be invoked by-and-by, when we have begun to feel more acutely the\r\nconsequences of our present prodigal use of the fuel that was stored up\r\nfor us by bountiful nature ages upon ages ago. The moon’s services to\r\nthe navigator, in affording him a ready means of finding his longitude\r\nat sea; to the chronologist and historian, as a timekeeper, counting\r\nperiods too vast for accurate reckoning by other means; to the\r\nastronomer and student of nature, in revealing certain wonderful\r\nsurroundings of the solar globe, which, but for the phenomena of\r\neclipses caused by the moon’s interposition, would never have been\r\nsuspected to exist—these were other functions that we dwelt upon, all\r\ntoo briefly for their deserts; and, lastly, we spoke of the moon as a\r\nmedal of creation fraught with instructive suggestions, which it has\r\nbeen our endeavour to bring to notice in the course of this work. And\r\nfrom uses we passed to abuses, directing attention to a few popular\r\nerrors and widespread illusions relating to lunar influence upon and in\r\nconnection with things terrestrial. This part of our work might have\r\nbeen considerably expanded, for, in truth, the moon has been a\r\nmisunderstood and misjudged body. Some justice we trust we have done to\r\nher: we have brought her face to the fireside; we have analysed her\r\nfeatures, and told of virtues that few of her admiring beholders\r\nconceived her to possess. We have traced out her history, fraught with\r\nwonderful interest, and doubtless typical of the history of other\r\nspheres that in countless numbers pervade the universe: and now, having\r\ndone our best to make all these points familiar, we commend the moon to\r\nstill further study and still more intimate acquaintance, confident that\r\nshe will repay all attentions, be they addressed to her as\r\n\r\n                   A PLANET, A WORLD, OR A SATELLITE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]The melting temperature of iron is 1500° Centigrade.\r\n\r\n[2]Mr. T. Heunter, Manager of the Iron-works of James Murray, Esq., of\r\n    Dalmellington, Ayrshire. Another authority (Mr. Snelus, of the West\r\n    Cumberland Iron Company), writes as follows: “I had a hole dug on\r\n    the ‘cinder-fall,’ and allowed the running slag to flow through it\r\n    so as to form a tolerably large pool and yet keep fluid. Any crust\r\n    that formed was skimmed off. A portion of the same slag was cooled,\r\n    and the solid lump thrown into the pool. It floated just at the\r\n    surface.” Mr. Snelus adds, by the way, that he tried “Bessemer-Pig”\r\n    in the same way, and that the solid pig sunk in the molten for a\r\n    minute and then _rose and floated_ just at the surface, with about\r\n    one-twentieth of its bulk above the level of the fluid.\r\n\r\n[3]Irradiation is an ocular phenomenon in virtue of which all strongly\r\n    illuminated objects appear to the eye to be larger than they really\r\n    are. The impression produced by light upon the retina appears to\r\n    extend itself around the focal image formed by the lenses of the\r\n    eye. It is from the effect of irradiation that a white disc on a\r\n    black ground looks larger than a black disc of the same size on a\r\n    white ground.\r\n\r\n[4]For the original photograph from which this plate was produced, and\r\n    for permission to reproduce it, we owe our acknowledgments to Warren\r\n    De la Rue and Joseph Beck, Esquires.\r\n\r\n[5]The proper distance for realising the conditions under which the moon\r\n    itself is seen will be that at which our disc is just covered by a\r\n    wafer about a quarter of an inch in diameter, held at arm’s length.\r\n    This will subtend an angle of about half a degree, which is nearly\r\n    the angular diameter of the moon.\r\n\r\n[6]The libratory movement has been taken advantage of, at the suggestion\r\n    of Sir Chas. Wheatstone, for producing stereoscopic photographs of\r\n    the moon. In the early days of stereoscopic photography the object\r\n    to be photographed was placed upon a kind of turn-table, and, after\r\n    a picture had been taken of it in one position, the table was turned\r\n    through a small angle for the taking of the second picture; the two\r\n    placed side by side then represented the object as it would have\r\n    been seen by two eyes widely separated, or whose visual rays\r\n    inclined at an angle equal to that through which the table was\r\n    turned; and when the pictures were viewed through a stereoscope,\r\n    they combined to produce the wonderful effect of solidity now\r\n    familiar to every one. The moon, by its librations, imitates the\r\n    turn-table movement; and, from a large number of photographs of her,\r\n    taken at different points of her orbit and at different seasons of\r\n    the year, it is possible to select two which, while they exhibit the\r\n    same phase of illumination, at the same time present the requisite\r\n    difference in the points of view from which they are taken to give\r\n    the effect of stereoscopicity when viewed binocularly. Mr. De la\r\n    Rue, the father of celestial photography, has been enabled to\r\n    produce several such pairs of pictures from the vast collection of\r\n    lunar photographs that he has accumulated. Any one of these pairs of\r\n    portraits, when stereoscopically combined, reproduces, to quote the\r\n    words of Sir John Herschel, “_the spherical_ form just as a giant\r\n    might see it whose stature were such that the interval between his\r\n    eyes should equal the distance between the place where the earth\r\n    stood when one view was taken, and that to which it would have to be\r\n    removed (our moon being fixed) to get the other. Nothing can surpass\r\n    the impression of _real corporeal form_ thus conveyed by some of\r\n    these pictures as taken by Mr. De la Rue with his powerful\r\n    reflector, the production of which (as a step in some sort taken by\r\n    man outside of the planet he inhabits) is one of the most remarkable\r\n    and unexpected triumphs of scientific art.”\r\n\r\n[7]This is a point of some uncertainty. Dr. Young stated (Lectures Vol.\r\n    II. p. 575) that “a minute is perhaps nearly the smallest interval\r\n    at which two objects can be distinguished, although a line\r\n    subtending only a tenth of a minute in breadth may sometimes be\r\n    perceived as a single object.”\r\n\r\n[8]Plate VIII.\r\n\r\n[9]“Cosmos,” Bohn’s Edition, Vol. V. p. 322.\r\n\r\n[10]_American Journal of Science, Second Series, Vol. II._\r\n\r\n[11]“Volcanoes,” page 155.\r\n\r\n[12]In reference to such prominences on the lunar surface as cast\r\n    steeple-like shadows, it is well to remark that we must not in all\r\n    cases infer, from the acute spire-like form of the shadow, that the\r\n    object which casts the shadow is of a similar sharp or spire-like\r\n    form, which the first impression would naturally lead us to suppose.\r\n    A comparatively blunt or rounded eminence will project a long and\r\n    pointed shadow when the rays of light fall on the object at a low\r\n    angle, and especially so when the shadow is projected on a convex\r\n    surface. We illustrate this with a copy of an actual photograph of\r\n    the shadow cast by half a pea, Fig. 41.\r\n\r\n[13]We meet a difficulty in reconciling this idea with the partial\r\n    craters of which we have a conspicuous example in Fracastorius, No.\r\n    78, of our Map, which seem to be partially sunk below the contiguous\r\n    surface. This looks as though the crater-rim belonged to an older\r\n    epoch than the plain from which it rises.\r\n\r\n[14]We are informed by a friend, who has lately visited Athens, that\r\n    Schmidt’s detail drawings of the Moon, comprising the work of forty\r\n    years, form a small library in themselves. The map embodying them is\r\n    so large (6 ft. 6 in. in diameter) and so full of detail that there\r\n    is small hope of its complete publication, unless there should be\r\n    such a wide extension of interest in the minute study of our\r\n    satellite as to justify the cost of reproducing it.\r\n\r\n[15]It is conceivable that the alleged changes in the crater Linné may\r\n    have been caused by a filling of the crater by some such crumbling\r\n    action as we are here contemplating.\r\n\r\n[16]Is it not conceivable that the protogerms of life pervade the whole\r\n    universe, and have been located upon every planetary body therein?\r\n    Sir William Thomson’s suggestion that life came to the earth upon a\r\n    seed-bearing meteor was weak, in so far that it shifted the locus of\r\n    life-generation from one planetary body to another. Is it not more\r\n    philosophical, more consistent with our conception of Creative\r\n    omnipotence and impartiality, to suppose that the protogerms of life\r\n    have been sown broadcast over all space, and that they have fallen\r\n    here upon a planet under conditions favourable to their development,\r\n    and have sprung into vitality when the fit circumstances have\r\n    arrived, and there upon a planet that is, and that may be for ever,\r\n    unfitted for their vivification?\r\n\r\n[17]Our remarks have general reference to a region of the moon near her\r\n    equator; near the poles some of the conditions we shall describe\r\n    would be somewhat modified.\r\n\r\n[18]We see this reddening during an eclipse of the moon (when the event\r\n    we are describing—an eclipse of the sun visible from the moon—really\r\n    takes place). The blood-red colour has often struck observers very\r\n    forcibly, and it has indeed been suggested that the appearance may\r\n    be the innocent and oft-repeated fulfilment of the prophetic\r\n    allusion to the moon being “turned into blood.”\r\n\r\n[19]About 100 years ago London was supplied with water chiefly by pumps\r\n    worked by tidal mills at London Bridge.\r\n\r\n[20]The sun and planets are comparatively useless for this object,\r\n    because of their slow movement among the stars; the change of their\r\n    positions from hour to hour is so small as to render uncertain the\r\n    Greenwich times deducible therefrom. Their use would be comparable\r\n    to taking the time from the hour-hand of a clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n             BRADBURY, AGNEW, & CO., PRINTERS, WHITEFRIARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       Albemarle Street,\r\n                                                       _December, 1873_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WORKS ON SCIENCE, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NATURALIST’S VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.
