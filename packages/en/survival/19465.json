In these cases the\r\noccasion for less completeness in the work must determine the extent to\r\nwhich the directions herein laid down are to be disregarded; but it is\r\nbelieved that, even in such cases, the principles on which those\r\ndirections are founded should be always borne in mind.\r\n\r\nNEWPORT, R.I., 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1 - A DRY SOIL.\r\nFig. 2 - A WET SOIL.\r\nFig. 3 - A DRAINED SOIL.\r\nFig. 4 - MAP OF LAND, WITH SWAMPS, ROCKS, SPRINGS AND TREES.

Sometimes it is the broad banner of standing water, or\r\ndark, wet streaks in plowed land, when all should be dry and of even\r\ncolor; sometimes only a fluttering rag of distress in curling corn, or\r\nwide-cracking clay, or feeble, spindling, shivering grain, which has\r\nsurvived a precarious winter, on the ice-stilts that have stretched its\r\ncrown above a wet soil; sometimes the quarantine flag of rank growth and\r\ndank miasmatic fogs.\r\n\r\nTo recognize these indications is the first office of the drainer; the\r\nsecond, to remove the causes from which they arise.\r\n\r\nIf a rule could be adopted which would cover the varied circumstances of\r\ndifferent soils, it would be somewhat as follows: All lands, of whatever\r\ntexture or kind, in which _the spaces between the particles of soil_ are\r\nfilled with water, (whether from rain or from springs,) within less than\r\nfour feet of the surface of the ground, except during and _immediately_\r\nafter heavy rains, require draining.\r\n\r\nOf course, the _particles_ of the soil cannot be made dry, nor should they\r\nbe; but, although they should be moist themselves, they should be\r\nsurrounded with air, not with water. To illustrate this: suppose that\r\nwater be poured into a barrel filled with chips of wood until it runs over\r\nat the top. The spaces between the chips will be filled with water, and\r\nthe chips themselves will absorb enough to become thoroughly wet;--this\r\nrepresents the worst condition of a wet soil. If an opening be made at the\r\nbottom of the barrel, the water which fills the spaces between the chips\r\nwill be drawn off, and its place will be taken by air, while the chips\r\nthemselves will remain wet from the water which they hold by absorption. A\r\ndrain at the bottom of a wet field draws away the water from the free\r\nspaces between its particles, and its place is taken by air, while the\r\nparticles hold, by attraction, the moisture necessary to a healthy\r\ncondition of the soil.\r\n\r\nThere are vast areas of land in this country which do not need draining.\r\nThe whole range of sands, gravels, light loams and moulds allow water to\r\npass freely through them, and are sufficiently drained by nature,\r\n_provided_, they are as open at the bottom as throughout the mass. A sieve\r\nfilled with gravel will drain perfectly; a basin filled with the same\r\ngravel will not drain at all. More than this, a sieve filled with the\r\nstiffest clay, if not \"puddled,\"(1) will drain completely, and so will\r\nheavy clay soils on porous and well drained subsoils. Money expended in\r\ndraining such lands as do not require the operation is, of course, wasted;\r\nand when there is doubt as to the requirement, tests should be made before\r\nthe outlay for so costly work is encountered.\r\n\r\nThere is, on the other hand, much land which only by thorough-draining can\r\nbe rendered profitable for cultivation, or healthful for residence, and\r\nvery much more, described as \"ordinarily dry land,\" which draining would\r\ngreatly improve in both productive value and salubrity.\r\n\r\n*The Surface Indications* of the necessity for draining are various. Those\r\nof actual swamps need no description; those of land in cultivation are\r\nmore or less evident at different seasons, and require more or less care\r\nin their examination, according to the circumstances under which they are\r\nmanifested.\r\n\r\nIf a plowed field show, over a part or the whole of its surface, a\r\nconstant appearance of dampness, indicating that, as fast as water is\r\ndried out from its upper parts, more is forced up from below, so that\r\nafter a rain it is much longer than other lands in assuming the light\r\ncolor of dry earth, it unmistakably needs draining.\r\n\r\nA pit, sunk to the depth of three or four feet in the earth, may collect\r\nwater at its bottom, shortly after a rain;--this is a sure sign of the need\r\nof draining.\r\n\r\nAll tests of the condition of land as to water,--such as trial pits,\r\netc.,--should be made, when practicable, during the wet spring weather, or\r\nat a time when the springs and brooks are running full. If there be much\r\nwater in the soil, even at such times, it needs draining.\r\n\r\nIf the water of heavy rains stands for some time on the surface, or if\r\nwater collects in the furrow while plowing, draining is necessary to bring\r\nthe land to its full fertility.\r\n\r\nOther indications may be observed in dry weather;--wide cracks in the soil\r\nare caused by the drying of clays, which, by previous soaking, have been\r\npasted together; the curling of corn often indicates that in its early\r\ngrowth it has been prevented, by a wet subsoil, from sending down its\r\nroots below the reach of the sun's heat, where it would find, even in the\r\ndryest weather, sufficient moisture for a healthy growth; any _severe_\r\neffect of drought, except on poor sands and gravels, may be presumed to\r\nresult from the same cause; and a certain wiryness of grass, together with\r\na mossy or mouldy appearance of the ground, also indicate excessive\r\nmoisture during some period of growth. The effects of drought are, of\r\ncourse, sometimes manifested on soils which do not require draining,--such\r\nas those poor gravels, which, from sheer poverty, do not enable plants to\r\nform vigorous and penetrating roots; but any soil of ordinary richness,\r\nwhich contains a fair amount of clay, will withstand even a severe\r\ndrought, without great injury to its crop, if it is thoroughly drained,\r\nand is kept loose at its surface.\r\n\r\nPoor crops are, when the cultivation of the soil is reasonably good,\r\ncaused either by inherent poverty of the land, or by too great moisture\r\nduring the season of early growth. Which of these causes has operated in a\r\nparticular case may be easily known. Manure will correct the difficulty in\r\nthe former case, but in the latter there is no real remedy short of such a\r\nsystem of drainage as will thoroughly relieve the soil of its surplus\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n*The Sources of the Water* in the soil are various. Either it falls\r\ndirectly upon the land as rain; rises into it from underlying springs; or\r\nreaches it through, or over, adjacent land.\r\n\r\nThe _rain water_ belongs to the field on which it falls, and it would be\r\nan advantage if it could all be made to pass down through the first three\r\nor four feet of the soil, and be removed from below. Every drop of it is\r\nfreighted with fertilizing matters washed out from the air, and in its\r\ndescent through the ground, these are given up for the use of plants; and\r\nit performs other important work among the vegetable and mineral parts of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThe _spring water_ does not belong to the field,--not a drop of it,--and it\r\nought not to be allowed to show itself within the reach of the roots of\r\nordinary plants. It has fallen on other land, and, presumably, has there\r\ndone its appointed work, and ought not to be allowed to convert our soil\r\ninto a mere outlet passage for its removal.\r\n\r\nThe _ooze water_,--that which soaks out from adjoining land,--is subject to\r\nall the objections which hold against spring water, and should be rigidly\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nBut the _surface water_ which comes over the surface of higher ground in\r\nthe vicinity, should be allowed every opportunity, which is consistent\r\nwith good husbandry, to work its slow course over our soil,--not to run in\r\nsuch streams as will cut away the surface, nor in such quantities as to\r\nmake the ground inconveniently wet, but to spread itself in beneficent\r\nirrigation, and to deposit the fertilizing matters which it contains, then\r\nto descend through a well-drained subsoil, to a free outlet.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever source the water comes, it cannot remain stagnant in any\r\nsoil without permanent injury to its fertility.\r\n\r\n*The Objection to too much Water in the Soil* will be understood from the\r\nfollowing explanation of the process of germination, (sprouting,) and\r\ngrowth. Other grave reasons why it is injurious will be treated in their\r\nproper order.\r\n\r\nThe first growth of the embryo plant, (in the seed,) is merely a change of\r\nform and position of the material which the seed itself contains. It\r\nrequires none of the elements of the soil, and would, under the same\r\nconditions, take place as well in moist saw-dust as in the richest mold.\r\nThe conditions required are, the exclusion of light; a certain degree of\r\nheat; and the presence of atmospheric air, and moisture. Any material\r\nwhich, without entirely excluding the air, will shade the seed from the\r\nlight, yield the necessary amount of moisture, and allow the accumulation\r\nof the requisite heat, will favor the chemical changes which, under these\r\ncircumstances, take place in the living seed. In proportion as the heat is\r\nreduced by the chilling effect of evaporation, and as atmospheric air is\r\nexcluded, will the germination of the seed be retarded; and, in case of\r\ncomplete saturation for a long time, absolute decay will ensue, and the\r\ngerm will die.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations, (Figures 1, 2 and 3,) from the \"Minutes of\r\nInformation\" on Drainage, submitted by the General Board of Health to the\r\nBritish Parliament in 1852, represent the different conditions of the soil\r\nas to moisture, and the effect of these conditions on the germination of\r\nseeds. The figures are thus explained by Dr. Madden, from whose lecture\r\nthey are taken:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Soil, examined mechanically, is found to consist entirely of\r\n    particles of all shapes and sizes, from stones and pebbles down to\r\n    the finest powder; and, on account of their extreme irregularity\r\n    of shape, they cannot lie so close to one another as to prevent\r\n    there being passages between them, owing to which circumstance\r\n    soil in the mass is always more or less _porous_. If, however, we\r\n    proceed to examine one of the smallest particles of which soil is\r\n    made up, we shall find that even this is not always solid, but is\r\n    much more frequently porous, like soil in the mass. A considerable\r\n    proportion of this finely-divided part of soil, _the impalpable\r\n    matter_, as it is generally called, is found, by the aid of the\r\n    microscope, to consist of _broken down vegetable tissue_, so that\r\n    when a small portion of the finest dust from a garden or field is\r\n    placed under the microscope, we have exhibited to us particles of\r\n    every variety of shape and structure, of which a certain part is\r\n    evidently of vegetable origin.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: Fig. 1 - A DRY SOIL.]\r\n\r\n                         Fig. 1 - A DRY SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"In these figures I have given a very rude representation of these\r\n    particles; and I must beg you particularly to remember that they\r\n    are not meant to represent by any means accurately what the\r\n    microscope exhibits, but are only designed to serve as a plan by\r\n    which to illustrate the mechanical properties of the soil. On\r\n    referring to Fig. 1, we perceive that there are two distinct\r\n    classes of pores,--first, the large ones, which exist _between_ the\r\n    particles of soil, and second, the very minute ones, which occur\r\n    in the particles themselves; and you will at the same time notice\r\n    that, whereas all the larger pores,--those between the particles of\r\n    soil,--communicate most freely with each other, so that they form\r\n    canals, the small pores, however freely they may communicate with\r\n    one another in the interior of the particle in which they occur,\r\n    have no direct connection with the pores of the surrounding\r\n    particles. Let us now, therefore, trace the effect of this\r\n    arrangement. In Fig. 1 we perceive that these canals and pores are\r\n    all empty, the soil being _perfectly dry_; and the canals\r\n    communicating freely at the surface with the surrounding\r\n    atmosphere, the whole will of course be filled with air. If in\r\n    this condition a seed be placed in the soil, at _a_, you at once\r\n    perceive that it is freely supplied with air, _but there is no\r\n    moisture_; therefore, when soil is _perfectly dry_, a seed cannot\r\n    grow.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Fig. 2 - A WET SOIL.]\r\n\r\n                             Fig. 2 - A WET SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Let us turn our attention now to Fig. 2. Here we perceive that\r\n    both the pores and canals are no longer represented white, but\r\n    black, this color being used to indicate water; in this instance,\r\n    therefore, water has taken the place of air, or, in other words,\r\n    the soil is _very wet_. If we observe our seed _a_ now, we find it\r\n    abundantly supplied with water, but _no air_. Here again,\r\n    therefore, germination cannot take place. It may be well to state\r\n    here that this can never occur _exactly_ in nature, because, water\r\n    having the power of dissolving air to a certain extent, the seed\r\n    _a_ in Fig. 2 is, in fact, supplied with a _certain_ amount of\r\n    this necessary substance; and, owing to this, germination does\r\n    take place, although by no means under such advantageous\r\n    circumstances as it would were the soil in a better condition.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Fig. 3 - A DRAINED SOIL.]\r\n\r\n                           Fig. 3 - A DRAINED SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"We pass on now to Fig. 3. Here we find a different state of\r\n    matters. The canals are open and freely supplied with air, while\r\n    the pores are filled with water; and, consequently, you perceive\r\n    that, while the seed _a_ has quite enough of air from the canals,\r\n    it can never be without moisture, as every particle of soil which\r\n    touches it is well supplied with this necessary ingredient. This,\r\n    then, is the proper condition of soil for germination, and in fact\r\n    for every period of the plant's development; and this condition\r\n    occurs when the soil is _moist_, but not _wet_,--that is to say,\r\n    when it has the color and appearance of being well watered, but\r\n    when it is still capable of being crumbled to pieces by the hands,\r\n    without any of its particles adhering together in the familiar\r\n    form of mud.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs plants grow under the same conditions, as to soil, that are necessary\r\nfor the germination of seeds, the foregoing explanation of the relation of\r\nwater to the particles of the soil is perfectly applicable to the whole\r\nperiod of vegetable growth. The soil, to the entire depth occupied by\r\nroots, which, with most cultivated plants is, in drained land, from two to\r\nfour feet, or even more, should be maintained, as nearly as possible, in\r\nthe condition represented in Fig. 3,--that is, the particles of soil should\r\nhold water by attraction, (absorption,) and the spaces between the\r\nparticles should be filled with air. Soils which require drainage are not\r\nin this condition. When they are not saturated with water, they are\r\ngenerally dried into lumps and clods, which are almost as impenetrable by\r\nroots as so many stones. The moisture which these clods contain is not\r\navailable to plants, and their surfaces are liable to be dried by the too\r\nfree circulation of air among the wide fissures between them. It is also\r\nworthy of incidental remark, that the cracking of heavy soils, shrinking\r\nby drought, is attended by the tearing asunder of the smaller roots which\r\nmay have penetrated them.\r\n\r\n*The Injurious Effects of Standing Water in the Subsoil* may be best\r\nexplained in connection with the description of a soil which needs\r\nunder-draining. It would be tedious, and superfluous, to attempt to detail\r\nthe various geological formations and conditions which make the soil\r\nunprofitably wet, and render draining necessary. Nor,--as this work is\r\nintended as a hand-book for practical use,--is it deemed advisable to\r\nintroduce the geological charts and sections, which are so often employed\r\nto illustrate the various sources of under-ground water; interesting as\r\nthey are to students of the theories of agriculture, and important as the\r\nstudy is, their consideration here would consume space, which it is\r\ndesired to devote only to the reasons for, and the practice of,\r\nthorough-draining.\r\n\r\nTo one writing in advocacy of improvements, of any kind, there is always a\r\ntemptation to throw a tub to the popular whale, and to suggest some\r\nmake-shift, by which a certain advantage may be obtained at half-price. It\r\nis proposed in this essay to resist that temptation, and to adhere to the\r\nrule that \"whatever is worth doing, is worth doing well,\" in the belief\r\nthat this rule applies in no other department of industry with more force\r\nthan in the draining of land, whether for agricultural or for sanitary\r\nimprovement. Therefore, it will not be recommended that draining be ever\r\nconfined to the wettest lands only; that, in the pursuance of a\r\npenny-wisdom, drains be constructed with stones, or brush, or boards; that\r\nthe antiquated horse-shoe tiles be used, because they cost less money; or\r\nthat it will, in any case, be economical to make only such drains as are\r\nnecessary to remove the water of large springs. The doctrine herein\r\nadvanced is, that, so far as draining is applied at all, it should be done\r\nin the most thorough and complete manner, and that it is better that, in\r\ncommencing this improvement, a single field be really well drained, than\r\nthat the whole farm be half drained.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are some farms which suffer from too much water, which\r\nare not worth draining at present; many more which, at the present price\r\nof frontier lands, are only worth relieving of the water which stands on\r\nthe surface; and not a few on which the quantity of stone to be removed\r\nsuggests the propriety of making wide ditches, in which to hide them,\r\n(using the ditches, incidentally, as drains). A hand-book of draining is\r\nnot needed by the owners of these farms; their operations are simple, and\r\nthey require no especial instruction for their performance. This work is\r\naddressed especially to those who occupy lands of sufficient value, from\r\ntheir proximity to market, to make it cheaper to cultivate well, than to\r\nbuy more land for the sake of getting a larger return from poor\r\ncultivation. Wherever Indian corn is worth fifty cents a bushel, on the\r\nfarm, it will pay to thoroughly drain every acre of land which needs\r\ndraining. If, from want of capital, this cannot be done at once, it is\r\nbest to first drain a portion of the farm, doing the work thoroughly well,\r\nand to apply the return from the improvement to its extension over other\r\nportions afterward.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the foregoing declaration of principles, it is left to the\r\nsagacity of the individual operator, to decide when the full effect\r\ndesired can be obtained, on particular lands, without applying the regular\r\nsystem of depth and distance, which has been found sufficient for the\r\nworst cases. The directions of this book will be confined to the treatment\r\nof land which demands thorough work.\r\n\r\nSuch land is that which, at some time during the period of vegetation,\r\ncontains stagnant water, at least in its sub-soil, within the reach of the\r\nroots of ordinary crops; in which there is not a free outlet _at the\r\nbottom_ for all the water which it receives from the heavens, from\r\nadjoining land, or from springs; and which is more or less in the\r\ncondition of standing in a great, water-tight box, with openings to let\r\nwater in, but with no means for its escape, except by evaporation at the\r\nsurface; or, having larger inlets than outlets, and being at times\r\n\"water-logged,\" at least in its lower parts. The subsoil, to a great\r\nextent, consists of clay or other compact material, which is not\r\n_impervious_, in the sense in which india-rubber is impervious, (else it\r\ncould not have become wet,) but which is sufficiently so to prevent the\r\nfree escape of water. The surface soil is of a lighter or more open\r\ncharacter, in consequence of the cultivation which it has received, or of\r\nthe decayed vegetable matter and the roots which it contains.\r\n\r\nIn such land the subsoil is wet,--almost constantly wet,--and the falling\r\nrain, finding only the surface soil in a condition to receive it, soon\r\nfills this, and often more than fills it, and stands on the surface. After\r\nthe rain, come wind and sun, to dry off the standing water,--to dry out the\r\nfree water in the surface soil, and to drink up the water of the subsoil,\r\nwhich is slowly drawn from below. If no spring, or ooze, keep up the\r\nsupply, and if no more rain fall, the subsoil may be dried to a\r\nconsiderable depth, cracking and gaping open, in wide fissures, as the\r\nclay loses its water of absorption, and shrinks. After the surface soil\r\nhas become sufficiently dry, the land may be plowed, seeds will germinate,\r\nand plants will grow. If there be not too much rain during the season, nor\r\ntoo little, the crop may be a fair one,--if the land be rich, a very good\r\none. It is not impossible, nor even very uncommon, for such soils to\r\nproduce largely, but they are always precarious. To the labor and expense\r\nof cultivation, which fairly earn a secure return, there is added the\r\nanxiety of chance; success is greatly dependent on the weather, and the\r\nweather may be bad: Heavy rains, after planting, may cause the seed to rot\r\nin the ground, or to germinate imperfectly; heavy rains during early\r\ngrowth may give an unnatural development, or a feeble character to the\r\nplants; later in the season, the want of sufficient rain may cause the\r\ncrop to be parched by drought, for its roots, disliking the clammy subsoil\r\nbelow, will have extended within only a few inches of the surface, and are\r\nsubject, almost, to the direct action of the sun's heat; in harvest time,\r\nbad weather may delay the gathering until the crop is greatly injured, and\r\nfall and spring work must often be put off because of wet.\r\n\r\nThe above is no fancy sketch. Every farmer who cultivates a retentive soil\r\nwill confess, that all of these inconveniences conspire, in the same\r\nseason, to lessen his returns, with very damaging frequency; and nothing\r\nis more common than for him to qualify his calculations with the proviso,\r\n\"if I have a good season.\" He prepares his ground, plants his seed,\r\ncultivates the crop, \"does his best,\"--thinks he does his best, that\r\nis,--and trusts to Providence to send him good weather. Such farming is\r\nattended with too much uncertainty,--with too much _luck_,--to be\r\nsatisfactory; yet, so long as the soil remains in its undrained condition,\r\nthe element of luck will continue to play a very important part in its\r\ncultivation, and bad luck will often play sad havoc with the year's\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nLand of this character is usually kept in grass, as long as it will bring\r\npaying crops, and is, not unfrequently, only available for pasture; but,\r\nboth for hay and for pasture, it is still subject to the drawback of the\r\nuncertainty of the seasons, and in the best seasons it produces far less\r\nthan it might if well drained.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this condition of the soil on the health of animals living\r\non it, and on the health of persons living near it, is extremely\r\nunfavorable; the discussion of this branch of the question, however, is\r\npostponed to a later chapter.\r\n\r\nThus far, there have been considered only the _effects_ of the undue\r\nmoisture in the soil. The manner in which these effects are produced will\r\nbe examined, in connection with the manner in which draining overcomes\r\nthem,--reducing to the lowest possible proportion, that uncertainty which\r\nalways attaches to human enterprises, and which is falsely supposed to\r\nbelong especially to the cultivation of the soil.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that the farmer believes, why should any one believe, in these\r\nmodern days, when the advancement of science has so simplified the\r\nindustrial processes of the world, and thrown its light into so many\r\ncorners, that the word \"mystery\" is hardly to be applied to any operation\r\nof nature, save to that which depends on the always mysterious Principle\r\nof Life,--when the effect of any combination of physical circumstances may\r\nbe foretold, with almost unerring certainty,--why should we believe that\r\nthe success of farming must, after all, depend mainly on chance? That an\r\nintelligent man should submit the success of his own patient efforts to\r\nthe operation of \"luck;\" that he should deliberately _bet_ his capital,\r\nhis toil, and his experience on having a good season, or a bad one,--this\r\nis not the least of the remaining mysteries. Some chance there must be in\r\nall things,--more in farming than in mechanics, no doubt; but it should be\r\nmade to take the smallest possible place in our calculations, by a careful\r\navoidance of every condition which may place our crops at the mercy of\r\nthat most uncertain of all things--the weather; and especially should this\r\nbe the case, when the very means for lessening the element of chance in\r\nour calculations are the best means for increasing our crops, even in the\r\nmost favorable weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. - HOW DRAINS ACT, AND HOW THEY AFFECT THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nFor reasons which will appear, in the course of this work, the only sort\r\nof drain to which reference is here made is that which consists of a\r\nconduit of burned clay, (tile,) placed at a considerable depth in the\r\nsubsoil, and enclosed in a compacted bed of the stiffest earth which can\r\nconveniently be found. Stone-drains, brush-drains, sod-drains, mole-plow\r\ntracks, and the various other devices for forming a conduit for the\r\nconveying away of the soakage-water of the land, are not without the\r\nsupport of such arguments as are based on the expediency of make-shifts,\r\nand are, perhaps, in rare cases, advisable to be used; but, for the\r\npurposes of permanent improvement, they are neither so good nor so\r\neconomical as tile-drains. The arguments of this book have reference to\r\nthe latter, (as the most perfect of all drains thus far invented,) though\r\nthey will apply, in a modified degree, to all underground conduits, so\r\nlong as they remain free from obstructions. Concerning stone-drains,\r\nattention may properly be called to the fact that, (contrary to the\r\ngeneral opinion of farmers,) they are very much more expensive than\r\ntile-drains. So great is the cost of cutting the ditches to the much\r\ngreater size required for stone than for tiles, of handling the stones, of\r\nplacing them properly in the ditches, and of covering them, after they are\r\nlaid, with a suitable barrier to the rattling down of loose earth among\r\nthem, that, as a mere question of first cost, it is far cheaper to buy\r\ntiles than to use stones, although these may lie on the surface of the\r\nfield, and only require to be placed in the trenches. In addition to this,\r\nthe great liability of stone-drains to become obstructed in a few years,\r\nand the certainty that tile-drains will, practically, last forever, are\r\nconclusive arguments in favor of the use of the latter. If the land is\r\nstony, it must be cleared; this is a proposition by itself, but if the\r\nsole object is to make drains, the best material should be used, and this\r\nmaterial is not stone.\r\n\r\nA well laid tile-drain has the following essential characteristics:--1. It\r\nhas a free outlet for the discharge of all water which may run through it.\r\n2. It has openings, at its joints, sufficient for the admission of all the\r\nwater which may rise to the level of its floor. 3. Its floor is laid on a\r\nwell regulated line of descent, so that its current may maintain a flow of\r\nuniform, or, at least, never decreasing rapidity, throughout its entire\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nLand which requires draining, is that which, at some time during the year,\r\n(either from an accumulation of the rains which fall upon it, from the\r\nlateral flow, or soakage, from adjoining land, from springs which open\r\nwithin it, or from a combination of two or all of these sources,) becomes\r\nfilled with water, that does not readily find a natural outlet, but\r\nremains until removed by evaporation. Every considerable addition to its\r\nwater wells up, and soaks its very surface; and that which is added after\r\nit is already brim full, must flow off over the surface, or lie in puddles\r\nupon it. Evaporation is a slow process, and it becomes more and more slow\r\nas the level of the water recedes from the surface, and is sheltered, by\r\nthe overlying earth, from the action of sun and wind. Therefore, at least\r\nduring the periods of spring and fall preparation of the land, during the\r\nearly growth of plants, and often even in midsummer, the\r\n_water-table_,--the top of the water of saturation,--is within a few inches\r\nof the surface, preventing the natural descent of roots, and, by reason of\r\nthe small space to receive fresh rains, causing an interruption of work\r\nfor some days after each storm.\r\n\r\nIf such land is properly furnished with tile-drains, (having a clear and\r\nsufficient outfall, offering sufficient means of entrance to the water\r\nwhich reaches them, and carrying it, by a uniform or increasing descent,\r\nto the outlet,) its water will be removed to nearly, or quite, the level\r\nof the floor of the drains, and its water-table will be at the distance of\r\nsome feet from the surface, leaving the spaces between the particles of\r\nall of the soil above it filled with air instead of water. The water below\r\nthe drains stands at a level, like any other water that is dammed up. Rain\r\nwater falling on the soil will descend by its own weight to this level,\r\nand the water will rise into the drains, as it would flow over a dam,\r\nuntil the proper level is again attained. Spring water entering from\r\nbelow, and water oozing from the adjoining land, will be removed in like\r\nmanner, and the usual condition of the soil, above the water-table, will\r\nbe that represented in Fig. 3, the condition which is best adapted to the\r\ngrowth of useful plants.\r\n\r\nIn the heaviest storms, some water will flow over the surface of even the\r\ndryest beach-sand; but, in a well drained soil the water of ordinary rains\r\nwill be at once absorbed, will slowly descend toward the water-table, and\r\nwill be removed by the drains, so rapidly, even in heavy clays, as to\r\nleave the ground fit for cultivation, and in a condition for steady\r\ngrowth, within a short time after the rain ceases. It has been estimated\r\nthat a drained soil has room between its particles for about one quarter\r\nof its bulk of water;--that is, four inches of drained soil contains free\r\nspace enough to receive a rain-fall one inch in depth, and, by the same\r\ntoken, four feet of drained soil can receive twelve inches of rain,---more\r\nthan is known to have ever fallen in twenty-four hours, since the deluge,\r\nand more than one quarter of the _annual_ rain-fall in the United States.\r\n\r\nAs was stated in the previous chapter, the water which reaches the soil\r\nmay be considered under two heads:\r\n\r\n1st--That which reaches its surface, whether directly by rain, or by the\r\nsurface flow of adjoining land.\r\n\r\n2d--That which reaches it below the surface, by springs and by soakage from\r\nthe lower portions of adjoining land.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is beneficial, because it contains fresh air, carbonic\r\nacid, ammonia, nitric acid, and heat, obtained from the atmosphere; and\r\nthe flowage water contains, in addition, some of the finer or more soluble\r\nparts of the land over which it has passed. The second, is only so much\r\ndead water, which has already given up, to other soil, all that ours could\r\nabsorb from it, and its effect is chilling and hurtful. This being the\r\ncase, the only interest we can have in it, is to keep it down from the\r\nsurface, and remove it as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe water of the first sort, on the other hand, should be arrested by\r\nevery device within our reach. If the land is steep, the furrows in\r\nplowing should be run horizontally along the hill, to prevent the escape\r\nof the water over the surface, and to allow it to descend readily into the\r\nground. Steep grass lands may have frequent, small, horizontal ditches for\r\nthe same purpose. If the soil is at all heavy, it should not, when wet, be\r\ntrampled by animals, lest it be puddled, and thus made less absorptive. If\r\nin cultivation, the surface should be kept loose and open, ready to\r\nreceive all of the rain and irrigation water that reaches it.\r\n\r\nIn descending through the soil, this water, in summer, gives up heat which\r\nit received from the air and from the heated surface of the ground, and\r\nthus raises the temperature of the lower soil. The fertilizing matters\r\nwhich it has obtained from the air,--carbonic acid, ammonia and nitric\r\nacid,--are extracted from it, and held for the use of growing plants. Its\r\nfresh air, and the air which follows the descent of the water-table,\r\ncarries oxygen to the organic and mineral parts of the soil, and hastens\r\nthe rust and decay by which these are prepared for the uses of vegetation.\r\nThe water itself supplies, by means of their power of absorption, the\r\nmoisture which is needed by the particles of the soil; and, having\r\nperformed its work, it goes down to the level of the water below, and,\r\nswelling the tide above the brink of the dam, sets the drains running,\r\nuntil it is all removed. In its descent through the ground, this water\r\nclears the passages through which it flows, leaving a better channel for\r\nthe water of future rains, so that, in time, the heaviest clays, which\r\nwill drain but imperfectly during the first one or two years, will pass\r\nwater, to a depth of four or five feet, almost as readily as the lighter\r\nloams.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine the drains to be closed up, leaving no outlet for the water,\r\nsave at the surface. This amounts to a raising of the dam to that height,\r\nand additions to the water will bring the water-table even with the top of\r\nthe soil. No provision being made for the removal of spring and soakage\r\nwater, this causes serious inconvenience, and even the rain-fall, finding\r\nno room in the soil for its reception, can only lie upon, or flow over,\r\nthe surface,--not yielding to the soil the fertilizing matters which it\r\ncontains, but, on the contrary, washing away some of its finer and looser\r\nparts. The particles of the soil, instead of being furnished, by\r\nabsorption, with a healthful amount of moisture, are made unduly wet; and\r\nthe spaces between them, being filled with water, no air can enter,\r\nwhereby the chemical processes by which the inert minerals, and the roots\r\nand manure, in the soil are prepared for the use of vegetation, are\r\ngreatly retarded.\r\n\r\nInstead of carrying the heat of the air, and of the surface of the ground,\r\nto the subsoil, the rain only adds so much to the amount of water to be\r\nevaporated, and increases, by so much, the chilling effect of evaporation.\r\n\r\nInstead of opening the spaces of the soil for the more free passage of\r\nwater and air, as is done by descending water, that which ascends by\r\nevaporation at the surface brings up soluble matters, which it leaves at\r\nthe point where it becomes a vapor, forming a crust that prevents the free\r\nentrance of air at those times when the soil is dry enough to afford it\r\nspace for circulation.\r\n\r\nInstead of crumbling to the fine condition of a loam, as it does, when\r\nwell drained, by the descent of water through it, heavy clay soil, being\r\nrapidly dried by evaporation, shrinks into hard masses, separated by wide\r\ncracks.\r\n\r\nIn short, in wet seasons, on such land, the crops will be greatly\r\nlessened, or entirely destroyed, and in dry seasons, cultivation will\r\nalways be much more laborious, more hurried, and less complete, than if it\r\nwere well drained.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing general statements, concerning the action of water in\r\ndrained, and in undrained land, and of the effects of its removal, by\r\ngravitation, and by evaporation, are based on facts which have been\r\ndeveloped by long practice, and on a rational application of well know\r\nprinciples of science. These facts and principles are worthy of\r\nexamination, and they are set forth below, somewhat at length, especially\r\nwith reference to _Absorption_ and _Filtration_; _Evaporation_;\r\n_Temperature_; _Drought_; _Porosity_ or _Mellowness;_ and _Chemical\r\nAction_.\r\n\r\nABSORPTION AND FILTRATION.--The process of under-draining is a process of\r\nabsorption and filtration, as distinguished from surface-flow and\r\nevaporation. The completeness with which the latter are prevented, and the\r\nformer promoted, is the measure of the completeness of the improvement. If\r\nwater lie on the surface of the ground until evaporated, or if it flow off\r\nover the surface, it will do harm; if it soak away through the soil, it\r\nwill do good. The rapidity and ease with which it is absorbed, and,\r\ntherefore, the extent to which under-draining is successful, depend on the\r\nphysical condition of the soil, and on the manner in which its texture is\r\naffected by the drying action of sun and wind, and by the downward passage\r\nof water through it.\r\n\r\nIn drying, all soils, except pure sands, shrink, and occupy less space\r\nthan when they are saturated with water. They shrink more or less,\r\naccording to their composition, as will be seen by the following table of\r\nresults obtained in the experiments of Schuebler:\r\n\r\n1,000 Parts of   Will Contract   1,000 Parts of   Will Contract\r\n                 Parts.                           Parts.\r\nStrong Limey     50.             Pure Clay        183.\r\nSoil\r\nHeavy Loam       60.             Peat             200.\r\nBrick Maker's    85.\r\nClay\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnson estimates that peat and heavy clay shrink one-fifth of\r\ntheir bulk.\r\n\r\nIf soil be dried suddenly, from a condition of extreme wetness, it will be\r\ndivided into large masses, or clods, separated by wide cracks. A\r\nsubsequent wetting of the clods, which is not sufficient to expand it to\r\nits former condition, will not entirely obliterate the cracks, and the\r\nnext drying will be followed by new fissures within the clods themselves;\r\nand a frequent repetition of this process will make the network of\r\nfissures finer and finer, until the whole mass of the soil is divided to a\r\npulverulent condition. This is the process which follows the complete\r\ndraining of such lands as contain large proportions of clay or of peat. It\r\nis retarded, in proportion to the amount of the free water in the soil\r\nwhich is evaporated from the surface, and in proportion to the trampling\r\nof the ground, when very wet. It is greatly facilitated by frost, and\r\nespecially by deep frost.\r\n\r\nThe fissures which are formed by this process are, in time, occupied by\r\nthe roots of plants, which remain and decay, when the crop has been\r\nremoved, and which prevent the soil from ever again closing on itself so\r\ncompletely as before their penetration; and each season's crop adds new\r\nroots to make the separation more complete and more universal; but it is\r\nonly after the water of saturation, which occupies the lower soil for so\r\nlarge a part of the year, has been removed by draining, that roots can\r\npenetrate to any considerable depth, and, in fact, the cracking of\r\nundrained soils, in drying, never extends beyond the separation into large\r\nmasses, because each heavy rain, by saturating the soil and expanding it\r\nto its full capacity, entirely obliterates the cracks and forms a solid\r\nmass, in which the operation has to be commenced anew with the next\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nMr. Gisborne, in his capital essay on \"Agricultural Drainage,\" which\r\nappeared in the _Quarterly Review_, No. CLXXI, says: \"We really thought\r\nthat no one was so ignorant as not to be aware that clay lands always\r\nshrink and crack with drought, and the stiffer the clay the greater the\r\nshrinking, as brickmakers well know. In the great drought, 36 years ago,\r\nwe saw in a very retentive soil in the Vale of Belvoir, cracks which it\r\nwas not very pleasant to ride among. This very summer, on land which, with\r\nreference to this very subject, the owner stated to be impervious, we put\r\na walking stick three feet into a sun-crack, without finding a bottom, and\r\nthe whole surface was what Mr. Parkes, not inappropriately, calls a\r\nnetwork of cracks. When heavy rain comes upon a soil in this state, of\r\ncourse the cracks fill, the clay imbibes the water, expands, and the\r\ncracks are abolished. But if there are four or five feet parallel drains\r\nin the land, the water passes at once into them and is carried off. In\r\nfact, when heavy rain falls upon clay lands in this cracked state, it\r\npasses off too quickly, without adequate filtration. Into the fissures of\r\nthe undrained soil the roots only penetrate to be perished by the cold and\r\nwet of the succeeding winter; but in the drained soil the roots follow the\r\nthreads of vegetable mold which have been washed into the cracks, and get\r\nan abiding tenure. Earth worms follow either the roots or the mold.\r\nPermanent schisms are established in the clay, and its whole character is\r\nchanged. An old farmer in a midland county began with 20-inch drains\r\nacross the hill, and, without ever reading a word, or, we believe,\r\nconversing with any one on the subject, poked his way, step by step, to\r\nfour or five feet drains, in the line of steepest descent. Showing us his\r\ndrains this spring, he said: 'They do better year by year; the water gets\r\na habit of coming to them '--a very correct statement of fact, though not a\r\nvery philosophical explanation.\"\r\n\r\nAlderman Mechi, of Tiptree Hall, says: \"Filtration may be too sudden, as\r\nis well enough shown by our hot sands and gravels; but I apprehend no one\r\nwill ever fear rendering strong clays too porous and manageable. The\r\nobject of draining is to impart to such soils the mellowness and dark\r\ncolor of self drained, rich and friable soil. That perfect drainage and\r\ncultivation will do this, is a well known fact. I know it in the case of\r\nmy own garden. How it does so I am not chemist enough to explain in\r\ndetail; but it is evident the effect is produced by the fibers of the\r\ngrowing crop intersecting every particle of the soil, which they never\r\ncould do before draining; these, with their excretions, decompose on\r\nremoval of the crop, and are acted on by the alternating air and water,\r\nwhich also decompose and change, in a degree, the inorganic substances of\r\nthe soil. Thereby drained land, which was, before, impervious to air and\r\nwater, and consequently unavailable to air and roots, to worms, or to\r\nvegetable or animal life, becomes, by drainage, populated by both, and is\r\na great chemical laboratory, as our own atmosphere is subject to all the\r\nchanges produced by animated nature.\"\r\n\r\nExperience proves that the descent of water through the soil renders it\r\nmore porous, so that it is easier for the water falling afterward to pass\r\ndown to the drains, but no very satisfactory reason for this has been\r\npresented, beyond that which is connected with the cracking of the soil.\r\nThe fact is well stated in the following extract from a letter to the\r\n_Country Gentleman_:\r\n\r\n\"A simple experiment will convince any farmer that the best means of\r\npermanently deepening and mellowing the soil is by thorough drainage, to\r\nafford a ready exit for all surplus moisture. Let him take in spring,\r\nwhile wet, a quantity of his hardest soil,--such as it is almost impossible\r\nto plow in summer,--such as presents a baked and brick-like character under\r\nthe influence of drought,--and place it in a box or barrel, open at the\r\nbottom, and frequently during the season let him saturate it with water.\r\nHe will find it gradually becoming more and more porous and\r\nfriable,--holding water less and less perfectly as the experiment proceeds,\r\nand in the end it will attain a state best suited to the growth of plants\r\nfrom its deep and mellow character.\"\r\n\r\nIt is equally a fact that the ascent of water in the soil, together with\r\nits evaporation at the surface, has the effect of making the soil\r\nimpervious to rains, and of covering the land with a crust of hard, dry\r\nearth, which forms a barrier to the free entrance of air. So far as the\r\nformation of crust is concerned, it is doubtless due to the fact that the\r\nwater in the soil holds in solution certain mineral matters, which it\r\ndeposits at the point of evaporation, the collection of these finely\r\ndivided matters serving to completely fill the spaces between the\r\nparticles of soil at the surface,--pasting them together, as it were. How\r\nfar below the surface this direct action extends, cannot be definitely\r\ndetermined; but the process being carried on for successive years,\r\naccumulating a quantity of these fine particles, each season, they are, by\r\ncultivation, and by the action of heavy showers falling at a time when the\r\nsoil is more or less dry, distributed through a certain depth, and\r\nordinarily, in all probability, are most largely deposited at the top of\r\nthe subsoil. It is found in practice that the first foot in depth of\r\nretentive soils is more retentive than that which lies below. If this\r\nopinion as to the cause of this greater imperviousness is correct, it will\r\nbe readily seen how water, descending to the drains, by carrying these\r\nsoluble and finer parts downward and distributing them more equally\r\nthrough the whole, should render the soil more porous.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the retention of water by the surface soil, often a very\r\nserious one, is the puddling which clayey lands undergo by working them,\r\nor feeding cattle upon them, when they are wet. This is always injurious.\r\nBy draining, land is made fit for working much earlier in the spring, and\r\nis sooner ready for pasturing after a rain, but, no matter how thoroughly\r\nthe draining has been done, if there is much clay in the soil, the effect\r\nof the improvement will be destroyed by plowing or trampling, while very\r\nwet; this impervious condition will be removed in time, of course, but\r\nwhile it lasts, it places us as completely at the mercy of the weather as\r\nwe were before a ditch was dug.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the use of the word _impervious_, it should be\r\nunderstood that it is not used in its strict sense, for no substance which\r\ncan be wetted by water is really impervious and the most retentive soil\r\nwill become wet. Gisborne states the case clearly when he says: \"Is your\r\nsubsoil moister after the rains of mid-winter, than it is after the\r\ndrought of mid-summer? If it is, it will drain.\"\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the rain-fall which will filtrate through the soil to\r\nthe level of the drains, varies with the composition of the soil, and with\r\nthe effect that the draining has had upon them.\r\n\r\nIn a very loose, gravelly, or sandy soil, which has a perfect outlet for\r\nwater below, all but the heaviest falls of rain will sink at once, while\r\non a heavy clay, no matter how well it is drained, the process of\r\nfiltration will be much more slow, and if the land be steeply inclined,\r\nsome of the water of ordinarily heavy rains must flow off over the\r\nsurface, unless, by horizontal plowing, or catch drains on the surface,\r\nits flow be retarded until it has time to enter the soil.\r\n\r\nThe power of drained soils to hold water, by absorption, is very great. A\r\ncubic foot of very dry soil, of favorable character, has been estimated to\r\nabsorb within its particles,--holding no free water, or water of\r\ndrainage,--about one-half its bulk of water; if this is true, the amount\r\nrequired to _moisten_ a dry soil, four feet deep, giving no excess to be\r\ndrained away, would amount to a rain fall of from 20 to 30 inches in\r\ndepth. If we consider, in addition to this, the amount of water drained\r\naway, we shall see that the soil has sufficient capacity for the reception\r\nof all the rain water that falls upon it.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the question of absorption and filtration, it is\r\ninteresting to investigate the movements of water in the ground. The\r\nnatural tendency of water, in the soil as well as out of it, is to descend\r\nperpendicularly toward the center of the earth. If it meet a flat layer of\r\ngravel lying upon clay, and having a free outlet, it will follow the\r\ncourse of the gravel,--laterally,--and find the outlet; if it meet water\r\nwhich is dammed up in the soil, and which has an outlet at a certain\r\nelevation, as at the floor of a drain, it will raise the general level of\r\nthe water, and force it out through the drain; if it meet water which has\r\nno outlet, it will raise its level until the soil is filled, or until it\r\naccumulates sufficient pressure, (head,) to force its way through the\r\nadjoining lands, or until it finds an outlet at the surface.\r\n\r\nThe first two cases named represent the condition which it is desirable to\r\nobtain, by either natural or artificial drainage; the third case is the\r\nonly one which makes drainage necessary. It is a fixed rule that water,\r\ndescending in the soil, will find the _lowest_ outlet to which there\r\nexists a channel through which it can flow, and that if, after heavy\r\nrains, it rise too near the surface of the ground, the proper remedy is to\r\ntap it at a lower level, and thus remove the water table to the proper\r\ndistance from the surface. This subject will be more fully treated in a\r\nfuture chapter, in considering the question of the depth, and the\r\nintervals, at which drains should be placed.\r\n\r\n*Evaporation.*--By evaporation is meant the process by which a liquid\r\nassumes the form of a gas or vapor, or \"dries up.\" Water, exposed to the\r\nair, is constantly undergoing this change. It is changed from the liquid\r\nform, and becomes a vapor in the air. Water in the form of vapor occupies\r\nnearly 2000 times the space that it filled as a liquid. As the vapor at\r\nthe time of its formation is of the same temperature with the water, and,\r\nfrom its highly expanded condition, requires a great _amount_ of heat to\r\nmaintain it as vapor, it follows that a given quantity of water contains,\r\nin the vapory form, many times as much heat as in the liquid form. This\r\nheat is taken from surrounding substances,--from the ground and from the\r\nair,--which are thereby made much cooler. For instance, if a shower moisten\r\nthe ground, on a hot summer day, the drying up of the water will cool both\r\nthe ground and the air. If we place a wet cloth on the head, and hasten\r\nthe evaporation of the water by fanning, we cool the head; if we wrap a\r\nwet napkin around a pitcher of water, and place it in a current of air,\r\nthe water in the pitcher is made cooler, by giving up its heat to the\r\nevaporating water of the napkin; when we sprinkle water on the floor of a\r\nroom, its evaporation cools the air of the room.\r\n\r\nSo great is the effect of evaporation, on the temperature of the soil,\r\nthat Dr. Madden found that the soil of a drained field, in which most of\r\nthe water was removed from below, was 6-1/2 deg. Far. warmer than a similar\r\nsoil undrained, from which the water had to be removed by evaporation.\r\nThis difference of 6-1/2 deg. is equal to a difference of elevation of 1,950\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nIt has been found, by experiments made in England, that the average\r\nevaporation of water from wet soils is equal to a depth of _two inches per\r\nmonth_, from May to August, inclusive; in America it must be very much\r\ngreater than this in the summer months, but this is surely enough for the\r\npurposes of illustration, as two inches of water, over an acre of land,\r\nwould weigh about _two hundred tons_. The amount of heat required to\r\nevaporate this is immense, and a very large part of it is taken from the\r\nsoil, which, thereby, becomes cooler, and less favorable for a rapid\r\ngrowth. It is usual to speak of heavy, wet lands as being \"cold,\" and it\r\nis now seen why they are so.\r\n\r\nIf none of the water which falls on a field is removed by drainage,\r\n(natural or artificial,) and if none runs off from the surface, the whole\r\nrain-fall of a year must be removed by evaporation, and the cooling of the\r\nsoil will be proportionately great. The more completely we withdraw this\r\nwater from the surface, and carry it off in underground drains, the more\r\ndo we reduce the amount to be removed by evaporation. In land which is\r\nwell drained, the amount evaporated, even in summer, will not be\r\nsufficient to so lower the temperature of the soil as to retard the growth\r\nof plants; the small amount dried out of the particles of the soil, (water\r\nof absorption,) will only keep it from being raised to too great a heat by\r\nthe mid-summer sun.\r\n\r\nAn idea of the amount of heat lost to the soil, in the evaporation of\r\nwater, may be formed from the fact that to evaporate, by artificial heat,\r\nthe amount of water contained in a rain-fall of two inches on an acre,\r\n(200 tons,) would require over 20 tons of coal. Of course a\r\nconsiderable--probably by far the larger,--part of the heat taken up in the\r\nprocess of evaporation is furnished by the air; but the amount abstracted\r\nfrom the soil is great, and is in direct proportion to the amount of water\r\nremoved by this process; hence, the more we remove by draining, the more\r\nheat we retain in the ground.\r\n\r\nThe season of growth is lengthened by draining, because, by avoiding the\r\ncooling effects of evaporation, germination is more rapid, and the young\r\nplant grows steadily from the start, instead of struggling against the\r\nretarding influence of a cold soil.\r\n\r\n*Temperature.*--The temperature of the soil has great effect on the\r\ngermination of seeds, the growth of plants, and the ripening of the crops.\r\n\r\nGisborne says: \"The evaporation of 1 lb. of water lowers the temperature\r\nof 100 lbs. of soil 10 deg.,--that is to say, that, if to 100 lbs. of soil,\r\nholding all the water it can by attraction, but containing no water of\r\ndrainage, is added 1 lb. of water which it has no means of discharging,\r\nexcept by evaporation, it will, by the time that it has so discharged it,\r\nbe 60 deg. colder than it would have been, if it had the power of discharging\r\nthis 1 lb. by filtration; or, more practically, that, if rain, entering in\r\nthe proportion of 1 lb. to 100 lbs. into a retentive soil, which is\r\nsaturated with water of attraction, is discharged by evaporation, it\r\nlowers the temperature of that soil 10 deg.. If the soil has the means of\r\ndischarging that 1 lb. of water by filtration, no effect is produced\r\nbeyond what is due to the relative temperatures of the rain and of the\r\nsoil.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been established by experiment that four times as much heat is\r\nrequired to evaporate a certain quantity of water, as to raise the same\r\nquantity from the freezing to the boiling point.\r\n\r\nIt is, probably, in consequence of this cooling effect of evaporation,\r\nthat wet lands are warmest when shaded, because, under this condition,\r\nevaporation is less active. Such lands, in cloudy weather, form an\r\nunnatural growth, such as results in the \"lodging\" of grain crops, from\r\nthe deficient strength of the straw which this growth produces.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather, the temperature of the lower soil is, of course, much\r\nlower than that of the air, and lower than that of the water of warm\r\nrains. If the soil is saturated with water, the water will, of course, be\r\nof an even temperature with the soil in which it lies, but if this be\r\ndrained off, warm air will enter from above, and give its heat to the\r\nsoil, while each rain, as it falls, will also carry its heat with it.\r\nFurthermore, the surface of the ground is sometimes excessively heated by\r\nthe summer sun, and the heat thus contained is carried down to the lower\r\nsoil by the descending water of rains, which thus cool the surface and\r\nwarm the subsoil, both beneficial.\r\n\r\nMr. Josiah Parkes, one of the leading draining engineers of England, has\r\nmade some experiments to test the extent to which draining affects the\r\ntemperature of the soil. The results of his observations are thus stated\r\nby Gisborne: \"Mr. Parkes gives the temperature on a Lancashire flat moss,\r\nbut they only commence 7 inches below the surface, and do not extend to\r\nmid-summer. At that period of the year the temperature, at 7 inches, never\r\nexceeded 66 deg., and was generally from 10 deg. to 15 deg. below the temperature of\r\nthe air in the shade, at 4 feet above the earth. Mr. Parkes' experiments\r\nwere made simultaneously, on a drained, and on an undrained portion of the\r\nmoss; and the result was, that, on a mean of 35 observations, the drained\r\nsoil at 7 inches in depth was 10 deg. warmer than the undrained, at the same\r\ndepth. The undrained soil never exceeded 47 deg., whereas, after a thunder\r\nstorm, the drained reached 66 deg. at 7 inches, and 48 deg. at 31 inches. Such\r\nwere the effects, at an early period of the year, on a black bog. They\r\nsuggest some idea of what they were, when, in July or August, thunder rain\r\nat 60 deg. or 70 deg. falls on a surface heated to 130 deg., and carries down with it,\r\ninto the greedy fissures of the earth, its augmented temperature. These\r\nadvantages, porous soils possess by nature, and retentive ones only\r\nacquire them by drainage.\"\r\n\r\nDrained land, being more open to atmospheric circulation, and having lost\r\nthe water which prevented the temperature of its lower portions from being\r\nso readily affected by the temperature of the air as it is when dry, will\r\nfreeze to a greater depth in winter and thaw out earlier in the spring.\r\nThe deep freezing has the effect to greatly pulverize the lower soil, thus\r\nbetter fitting it for the support of vegetation; and the earlier thawing\r\nmakes it earlier ready for spring work.\r\n\r\n*Drought.*--At first thought, it is not unnatural to suppose that draining\r\nwill increase the ill effect of too dry seasons, by removing water which\r\nmight keep the soil moist. Experience has proven, however, that the result\r\nis exactly the opposite of this. Lands which suffer most from drought are\r\nmost benefited by draining,--more in their greater ability to withstand\r\ndrought than in any other particular.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this action of draining become obvious, when its effects\r\non the character of the soil are examined. There is always the same amount\r\nof water in, and about, the surface of the earth. In winter there is more\r\nin the soil than in summer, while in summer, that which has been dried out\r\nof the soil exists in the atmosphere in the form of a _vapor_. It is held\r\nin the vapory form by _heat_, which may be regarded as _braces_ to keep it\r\ndistended. When vapor comes in contact with substances sufficiently colder\r\nthan itself, it gives up its heat,--thus losing its braces,--contracts,\r\nbecomes liquid water, and is deposited as dew.\r\n\r\nMany instances of this operation are familiar to all.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a cold pitcher in the summer robs the vapor in the air of\r\nits heat, and causes it to be deposited on its own surface,--of course the\r\nwater comes from the atmosphere, not through the wall of the pitcher; if\r\nwe breathe on a knife blade, it condenses, in the same manner, the\r\nmoisture of the breath, and becomes covered with a film of-water;\r\nstone-houses are damp in summer, because the inner surface of their walls,\r\nbeing cooler than the atmosphere, causes its moisture to be deposited in\r\nthe manner described;(2) nearly every night, in summer, the cold earth\r\nreceives moisture from the atmosphere in the form of dew; a single large\r\nhead of cabbage, which at night is very cold, often condenses water to the\r\namount of a gill or more.\r\n\r\nThe same operation takes place in the soil. When the air is allowed to\r\ncirculate among its lower and cooler, (because more shaded,) particles,\r\nthey receive moisture by the same process of condensation. Therefore,\r\nwhen, by the aid of under-drains, the lower soil becomes sufficiently\r\nloose and open, to allow a circulation of air, the deposit of atmospheric\r\nmoisture will keep it supplied with water, at a point easily accessible to\r\nthe roots of plants.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to satisfy ourselves that this is practically correct, we have\r\nonly to prepare two boxes of finely pulverized soil,--one three or four\r\ninches deep,--and the other fifteen or twenty inches deep, and place them\r\nin the sun, at midday, in summer. The thinner soil will soon be completely\r\ndried, while the deeper one, though it may have been previously dried in\r\nan oven, will soon accumulate a large amount of water on those particles\r\nwhich, being lower and better sheltered from the sun's heat than the\r\nparticles of the thin soil, are made cooler.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that even the most retentive soil,--the stiffest clay,--is made\r\nporous by the repeated passage of water from the surface to the level of\r\nthe drains, and that the ability to admit air, which plowing gives it, is\r\nmaintained for a much longer time than if it were usually saturated with\r\nwater which has no other means of escape than by evaporation at the\r\nsurface. The power of dry soils to absorb moisture from the air may be\r\nseen by an examination of the following table of results obtained by\r\nSchuebler, who exposed 1,000 grains of dried soil of the various kinds\r\nnamed to the action of the air:\r\n\r\nKind of Soil.       Amount of Water Absorbed\r\n                    in 24 Hours.\r\nCommon Soil         22 grains.\r\nLoamy Clay          26 grains.\r\nGarden Soil         45 grains.\r\nBrickmakers' Clay   30 grains.\r\n\r\nThe effect of draining in overcoming drought, by admitting atmospheric\r\nvapor will, of course, be very much increased if the land be thoroughly\r\nloosened by cultivation, and especially if the surface be kept in an open\r\nand mellow condition.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the moisture received from the air, as above described,\r\nwater is, in a porous soil, drawn up from the wetter subsoil below, by the\r\nsame attractive force which acts to wet the whole of a sponge of which\r\nonly the lower part touches the water;--as a hard, dry, compact sponge will\r\nabsorb water much less readily than one which is loose and open, so the\r\nhard clods, into which undrained clay is dried, drink up water much less\r\nfreely than they will do after draining shall have made them more friable.\r\n\r\nThe source of this underground moisture is the \"water table,\"--the level of\r\nthe soil below the influence of the drains,--and this should be so placed\r\nthat, while its water will easily rise to a point occupied by the feeding\r\nroots of the crop, it should yield as little as possible for evaporation\r\nat the surface.\r\n\r\nAnother source of moisture, in summer, is the deposit of dew on the\r\nsurface of the ground. The amount of this is very difficult to determine,\r\nand accurate American experiments on the subject are wanting. Of course\r\nthe amount of dew is greater here than in England, where Dr. Dalton, a\r\nskillful examiner of atmospheric phenomena, estimates the annual deposit\r\nof dew to equal a depth of five inches, or about one-fifth of the\r\nrain-fall. Water thus deposited on the soil is absorbed more or less\r\ncompletely, in proportion to the porosity of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which plants will be affected by drought depends, other\r\nthings being equal, on the depth to which they send their roots. If these\r\nlie near the surface, they will be parched by the heat of the sun. If they\r\nstrike deeply into the damper subsoil, the sun will have less effect on\r\nthe source from which they obtain their moisture. Nothing tends so much to\r\ndeep rooting, as the thorough draining of the soil. If the _free_ water be\r\nwithdrawn to a considerable distance from the surface, plants,--even\r\nwithout the valuable aid of deep and subsoil plowing,--will send their\r\nroots to great depths. Writers on this subject cite many instances in\r\nwhich the roots of ordinary crops \"not mere hairs, but strong fibres, as\r\nlarge as pack-thread,\" sink to the depth of 4, 6, and in some instances 12\r\nor 14 feet. Certain it is that, in a healthy, well aerated soil, any of\r\nthe plants ordinarily cultivated in the garden or field will send their\r\nroots far below the parched surface soil; but if the subsoil is wet, cold,\r\nand soggy, at the time when the young crop is laying out its plan of\r\nfuture action, it will perforce accommodate its roots to the limited space\r\nwhich the comparatively dry surface soil affords.\r\n\r\nIt is well known among those who attend the meetings of the Farmers' Club\r\nof the American Institute, in New York, that the farm of Professor Mapes,\r\nnear Newark, N.J., which maintains its wonderful fertility, year after\r\nyear, without reference to wet or dry weather, has been rendered almost\r\nabsolutely indifferent to the severest drought, by a course of cultivation\r\nwhich has been rendered possible only by under-draining. The lawns of the\r\nCentral Park, which are a marvel of freshness, when the lands about the\r\nPark are burned brown, owe their vigor mainly to the complete drainage of\r\nthe soil. What is true of these thoroughly cultivated lands, it is\r\npracticable to attain on all soils, which, from their compact condition,\r\nare now almost denuded of vegetation in dry seasons.\r\n\r\n*Porosity or Mellowness.*--An open and mellow condition of the soil is\r\nalways favorable for the growth of plants. They require heat, fresh air\r\nand moisture, to enable them to take up the materials on which they live,\r\nand by which they grow. We have seen that the heat of retentive soils is\r\nalmost directly proportionate to the completeness with which their free\r\nwater is removed by underground draining, and that, by reason of the\r\nincreased facility with which air and water circulate within them, their\r\nheat is more evenly distributed among all those parts of the soil which\r\nare occupied by roots. The word _moisture_, in this connection, is used in\r\ncontradistinction to _wetness_, and implies a condition of freshness and\r\ndampness,--not at all of saturation. In a saturated, a soaking-wet soil,\r\nevery space between the particles is filled with water to the entire\r\nexclusion of the atmosphere, and in such a soil only aquatic plants will\r\ngrow. In a _dry_ soil, on the other hand, when the earth is contracted\r\ninto clods and baked, almost as in an oven,--one of the most important\r\nconditions for growth being wanting,--nothing can thrive, save those plants\r\nwhich ask of the earth only an anchoring place, and seek their nourishment\r\nfrom the air. Both air plants and water plants have their wisely assigned\r\nplaces in the economy of nature, and nature provides them with ample space\r\nfor growth. Agriculture, however, is directed to the production of a class\r\nof plants very different from either of these,--to those which can only\r\ngrow to their greatest perfection in a soil combining, not one or two\r\nonly, but all three of the conditions named above. While they require\r\nheat, they cannot dispense with the moisture which too great heat removes;\r\nwhile they require moisture, they cannot abide the entire exclusion of\r\nair, nor the dissipation of heat which too much water causes. The interior\r\npart of the pellets of a well pulverized soil should contain all the water\r\nthat they can hold by their own absorptive power, just as the finer walls\r\nof a damp sponge hold it; while the spaces between these pellets, like the\r\npores of the sponge, should be filled with air.\r\n\r\nIn such a soil, roots can extend in any direction, and to considerable\r\ndepth, without being parched with thirst, or drowned in stagnant water,\r\nand, other things being equal, plants will grow to their greatest possible\r\nsize, and all their tissues will be of the best possible texture. On rich\r\nland, which is maintained in this condition of porosity and mellowness,\r\nagriculture will produce its best results, and will encounter the fewest\r\npossible chances of failure. Of course, there are not many such soils to\r\nbe found, and such absolute balance between warmth and moisture in the\r\nsoil cannot be maintained at all times, and under all circumstances, but\r\nthe more nearly it is maintained, the more nearly perfect will be the\r\nresults of cultivation.\r\n\r\n*Chemical Action in the Soil.*--Plants receive certain of their\r\nconstituents from the soil, through their roots. The raw materials from\r\nwhich these constituents are obtained are the minerals of the soil, the\r\nmanures which are artificially applied, water, and certain substances\r\nwhich are taken from the air by the absorptive action of the soil, or are\r\nbrought to it by rains, or by water flowing over the surface from other\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe mineral matters, which constitute the ashes of plants, when burned,\r\nare not mere accidental impurities which happen to be carried into their\r\nroots in solution in the water which supplies the sap, although they vary\r\nin character and proportion with each change in the mineral composition of\r\nthe soil. It is proven by chemical analysis, that the composition of the\r\nashes, not only of different species of plants, but of different parts of\r\nthe same plant, have distinctive characters,--some being rich in\r\nphosphates, and others in silex; some in potash, and others in lime,--and\r\nthat these characters are in a measure the same, in the same plants or\r\nparts of plants, without especial reference to the soil on which they\r\ngrow. The minerals which form the ashes of plants, constitute but a very\r\nsmall part of the soil, and they are very sparsely distributed throughout\r\nthe mass; existing in the interior of its particles, as well as upon their\r\nsurfaces. As roots cannot penetrate to the interior of pebbles and compact\r\nparticles of earth, in search of the food which they require, but can only\r\ntake that which is exposed on their surfaces, and, as the oxydizing effect\r\nof atmospheric air is useful in preparing the crude minerals for\r\nassimilation, as well as in decomposing the particles in which they are\r\nbound up,--a process which is allied to the _rusting_ of metals,--the more\r\nfreely atmospheric air is allowed, or induced, to circulate among the\r\ninner portions of the soil, the more readily are its fertilizing parts\r\nmade available for the use of roots. By no other process, is air made to\r\nenter so deeply, nor to circulate so readily in the soil, as by\r\nunder-draining, and the deep cultivation which under-draining facilitates.\r\n\r\nOf the manures which are applied to the land, those of a mineral character\r\nare affected by draining, in the same manner as the minerals which are\r\nnative to the soil; while organic, or animal and vegetable, manures,\r\n(especially when applied, as is usual, in an incompletely fermented\r\ncondition,) absolutely require fresh supplies of atmospheric air, to\r\ncontinue the decomposition which alone can prepare them for their proper\r\neffect on vegetation.\r\n\r\nIf kept saturated with water, so that the air is excluded, animal manures\r\nlie nearly inert, and vegetable matters decompose but\r\nincompletely,--yielding acids which are injurious to vegetation, and which\r\nwould not be formed in the presence of a sufficient supply of air. An\r\ninstance is cited by H. Wauer where sheep dung was preserved, for five\r\nyears, by excessive moisture, which kept it from the air. If the soil be\r\nsaturated with water in the spring, and, in summer, (by the compacting of\r\nits surface, which is caused by evaporation,) be closed against the\r\nentrance of air, manures will be but slowly decomposed, and will act but\r\nimperfectly on the crop,--if, on the other hand, a complete system of\r\ndrainage be adopted, manures, (and the roots which have been left in the\r\nground by the previous crop,) will be readily decomposed, and will\r\nexercise their full influence on the soil, and on the plants growing in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAgain, manures are more or less effective, in proportion as they are more\r\nor less thoroughly mixed with the soil. In an undrained, retentive soil,\r\nit is not often possible to attain that perfect _tilth_, which is best\r\nsuited for a proper admixture, and which is easily given after thorough\r\ndraining.\r\n\r\nThe soil must be regarded as the laboratory in which nature, during the\r\nseason of growth, is carrying on those hidden, but indispensable chemical\r\nseparations, combinations, and re-combinations, by which the earth is made\r\nto bear its fruits, and to sustain its myriad life. The chief demand of\r\nthis laboratory is for free ventilation. The raw material for the work is\r\nat hand,--as well in the wet soil as in the dry; but the door is sealed,\r\nthe damper is closed, and only a stray whiff of air can, now and then,\r\ngain entrance,--only enough to commence an analysis, or a combination,\r\nwhich is choked off when half complete, leaving food for sorrel, but\r\nmaking none for grass. We must throw open door and window, draw away the\r\nwater in which all is immersed, let in the air, with its all destroying,\r\nand, therefore, all re-creating oxygen, and leave the forces of nature's\r\nbeneficent chemistry free play, deep down in the ground. Then may we hope\r\nfor the full benefit of the fertilizing matters which our good soil\r\ncontains, and for the full effect of the manures which we add.\r\n\r\nWith our land thoroughly improved, as has been described, we may carry on\r\nthe operations of farming with as much certainty of success, and with as\r\ngreat immunity from the ill effects of unfavorable weather, as can be\r\nexpected in any business, whose results depend on such a variety of\r\ncircumstances. We shall have substituted certainty for chance, as far as\r\nit is in our power to do so, and shall have made farming an art, rather\r\nthan a venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. - HOW TO GO TO WORK TO LAY OUT A SYSTEM OF DRAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to lay out the drains; where to place the outlet; where to locate the\r\nmain collecting lines; how to arrange the laterals which are to take the\r\nwater from the soil and deliver it at the mains; how deep to go; at what\r\nintervals; what fall to give; and what sizes of tile to use,--these are all\r\nquestions of great importance to one who is about to drain land.\r\n\r\nOn the proper adjustment of these points, depend the _economy_ and\r\n_effectiveness_ of the work. Time and attention given to them, before\r\ncommencing actual operations, will prevent waste and avoid failure. Any\r\nperson of ordinary intelligence may qualify himself to lay out\r\nunder-drains and to superintend their construction,--but the knowledge\r\nwhich is required does not come by nature. Those who have not the time for\r\nthe necessary study and practice to make a plan for draining their land,\r\nwill find it economical to employ an engineer for the purpose. In this era\r\nof railroad building, there is hardly a county in America which has not a\r\npractical surveyor, who may easily qualify himself, by a study of the\r\nprinciples and directions herein set forth, to lay out an economical plan\r\nfor draining any ordinary agricultural land, to stake the lines, and to\r\ndetermine the grade of the drains, and the sizes of tile with which they\r\nshould be furnished.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Mr. Gisborne says: \"If we should give a stimulus to\r\namateur draining, we shall do a great deal of harm. We wish we could\r\npublish a list of the moneys which have been squandered in the last 40\r\nyears in amateur draining, either ineffectually or with very imperfect\r\nefficiency. Our own name would be inscribed in the list for a very\r\nrespectable sum. Every thoughtless squire supposes that, with the aid of\r\nhis ignorant bailiff, he can effect a perfect drainage of his estate; but\r\nthere is a worse man behind the squire and the bailiff,--the draining\r\nconjuror. * * * * * * These fellows never go direct about their work. If\r\nthey attack a spring, they try to circumvent it by some circuitous route.\r\nThey never can learn that nature shows you the weakest point, and that you\r\nshould assist her,--that _hit him straight in the eye_ is as good a maxim\r\nin draining as in pugilism. * * * * * * If you wish to drain, we recommend\r\nyou to take advice. We have disposed of the quack, but there is a faculty,\r\nnot numerous but extending, and whose extension appears to us to be\r\nindispensable to the satisfactory progress of improvements by draining,--a\r\nfaculty of draining engineers. If we wanted a profession for a lad who\r\nshowed any congenial talent, we would bring him up to be a draining\r\nengineer.\" He then proceeds to speak of his own experience in the matter,\r\nand shows that, after more than thirty years of intelligent practice, he\r\nemployed Mr. Josiah Parkes to lay out and superintend his work, and thus\r\neffected a saving, (after paying all professional charges,) of fully\r\ntwelve per cent. on the cost of the draining, which was, at the same time,\r\nbetter executed than any that he had previously done.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, in nearly all amateur draining, the unnecessary\r\nfrequency of the lateral drains; the extravagant size of the pipes used;\r\nand the number of useless angles which result from an unskillful\r\narrangement, would amount to an expense equal to ten times the cost of the\r\nproper superintendence, to say nothing of the imperfect manner in which\r\nthe work is executed. A common impression seems to prevail, that if a\r\n2-inch pipe is good, a 3-inch pipe must be better, and that, generally, if\r\ndraining is worth doing at all, it is worth overdoing; while the great\r\nimportance of having perfectly fitting connections is not readily\r\nperceived. The general result is, that most of the tile-draining in this\r\ncountry has been too expensive for economy, and too careless for lasting\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to give, in this chapter, as complete a description of the\r\npreliminary engineering of draining as can be concentrated within a few\r\npages, and a hope is entertained, that it will, at least, convey an idea\r\nof the importance of giving a full measure of thought and ingenuity to the\r\nmaturing of the _plan_, before the execution of the work is commenced.\r\n\"Farming upon paper\" has never been held in high repute, but draining upon\r\npaper is less a subject for objection. With a good map of the farm,\r\nshowing the comparative levels of outlet, hill, dale, and plain, and the\r\nsizes and boundaries of the different in closures, a profitable winter may\r\nbe passed,--with pencil and rubber,--in deciding on a plan which will do the\r\nrequired work with the least possible length of drain, and which will\r\nrequire the least possible extra deep cutting; and in so arranging the\r\nmain drains as to require the smallest possible amount of the larger and\r\nmore costly pipes; or, if only a part of the farm is to be drained during\r\nthe coming season, in so arranging the work that it will dovetail nicely\r\nwith future operations. A mistake in actual work is costly, and, (being\r\nburied under the ground,) is not easily detected, while errors in drawing\r\nupon paper are always obvious, and are remedied without cost.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of illustrating the various processes connected with the\r\nlaying out of a system of drainage, the mode of operating on a field of\r\nten acres will be detailed, in connection with a series of diagrams\r\nshowing the progress of the work.\r\n\r\n*A Map of the Land* is first made, from a careful survey. This should be\r\nplotted to a scale of 50 or 100 feet to the inch,(3) and should exhibit\r\nthe location of obstacles which may interfere with the regularity of the\r\ndrains,--such as large trees, rocks, etc., and the existing swamps, water\r\ncourses, springs, and open drains. (Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nThe next step is to locate the contour lines of the land, or the lines of\r\nequal elevation,--also called the _horizontal lines_,--which serve to show\r\nthe shape of the surface. To do this, stake off the field into squares of\r\n50 feet, by first running a base line through the center of the greatest\r\nlength of the field, marking it with stakes at intervals of 50 feet, then\r\nstake other lines, also at intervals of 50 feet, perpendicular to the base\r\nline, and then note the position of the stakes on the maps; next, by the\r\naid of an engineer's level and staff, ascertain the height, (above an\r\nimaginary plain below the lowest part of the field,) of the surface of the\r\nground at each stake, and note this elevation at its proper point on the\r\nmap. This gives a plot like Fig. 5. The best instrument with which to take\r\nthese levels, is the ordinary telescope-level used by railroad engineers,\r\nshown in Fig. 6, which has a telescope with cross hairs intersecting each\r\nother in the center of the line of sight, and a \"bubble\" placed exactly\r\nparallel to this line. The instrument, fixed on a tripod, and so adjusted\r\nthat it will turn to any point of the compass without disturbing the\r\nposition of the bubble, will, (as will its \"line of sight,\") revolve in a\r\nperfectly horizontal plane. It is so placed as to command a view of a\r\nconsiderable stretch of the field, and its height above the imaginary\r\nplane is measured, an attendant places next to one of the stakes a\r\nlevelling rod, (Fig. 7,) which is divided into feet and fractions of a\r\nfoot, and is furnished with a movable target, so painted that its center\r\npoint may be plainly seen. The attendant raises and lowers the target,\r\nuntil it comes exactly in the line of sight; its height on the rod denotes\r\nthe height of the instrument above the level of the ground at that stake,\r\nand, as the height of the instrument above the imaginary plane has been\r\nreached, by subtracting one elevation from the other, the operator\r\ndetermines the height of the ground at that stake above the imaginary\r\nplane,--which is called the \"_datum line_.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 4 - MAP OF LAND, WITH SWAMPS, ROCKS, SPRINGS AND\r\n   TREES. INTENDED TO REPRESENT A FIELD OF TEN ACRES BEFORE DRAINING.]\r\n\r\n Fig. 4 - MAP OF LAND, WITH SWAMPS, ROCKS, SPRINGS AND TREES. INTENDED TO\r\n             REPRESENT A FIELD OF TEN ACRES BEFORE DRAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5 - MAP WITH 50-FOOT SQUARES, AND CONTOUR LINES.]\r\n\r\n          Fig. 5 - MAP WITH 50-FOOT SQUARES, AND CONTOUR LINES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5 - MAP WITH 50-FOOT SQUARES, AND CONTOUR LINES.]\r\n\r\n                    Fig. 6 - LEVELLING INSTRUMENT.(4)\r\n\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Fig. 7 - LEVELLING ROD.]\r\n\r\n                           Fig. 7 - LEVELLING ROD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next operation is to trace, on the plan, lines following the same\r\nlevel, wherever the land is of the proper height for its surface to meet\r\nthem. For the purpose of illustrating this operation, lines at intervals\r\nof elevation of one foot are traced on the plan in Fig. 8. And these lines\r\nshow, with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes, the elevation and\r\nrate of inclination of all parts of the field,--where it is level or nearly\r\nso, where its rise is rapid, and where slight. As the land rises one foot\r\nfrom the position of one line to the position of the line next above it,\r\nwhere the distance from one line to the next is great, the land is more\r\nnearly level, and when it is short the inclination is steeper. For\r\ninstance, in the southwest corner of the plan, the land is nearly level to\r\nthe 2-foot line; it rises slowly to the center of the field, and to the\r\neastern side about one-fourth of the distance from the southern boundary,\r\nwhile an elevation coming down between these two valleys, and others\r\nskirting the west side of the former one and the southern side of the\r\nlatter, are indicated by the greater nearness of the lines. The points at\r\nwhich the contour lines cross the section lines are found in the following\r\nmanner: On the second line from the west side of the field we find the\r\nelevations of the 4th, 5th and 6th stakes from the southern boundary to be\r\n1.9, 3.3, and 5.1. The contour lines, representing points of elevation of\r\n2, 3, 4, and 5 feet above the _datum line_, will cross the 50-foot lines\r\nat their intersections, only where these intersections are marked in even\r\nfeet. When they are marked with fractions of a foot, the lines must be\r\nmade to cross at points between two intersections,--nearer to one or the\r\nother, according to their elevations,--thus between 1.9 and 3.3, the 2-foot\r\nand 3-foot contour lines must cross. The total difference of elevation,\r\nbetween the two points is 3.3--1.9=1.4; 10/14 of the space must be given to\r\nthe even foot between the lines, and the 2-foot line should be 1/14 of the\r\nspace above the point 1.9;--the 3-foot line will then come 3/14 below the\r\npoint 3.3. In the same manner, the line from 3.3 to 5.1 is divided into 18\r\nparts, of which 10 go to the space between the 4. and 5. lines, 7 are\r\nbetween 3.3 and the 4-foot line, and 1 between the 5-foot line and 5.1.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: Fig. 8 - MAP WITH CONTOUR LINES.]\r\n\r\n                     Fig. 8 - MAP WITH CONTOUR LINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these maps, made from observations taken in the field, we are\r\nprepared to lay down, on paper, our system of drainage, and to mature a\r\nplan which shall do the necessary work with the least expenditure of labor\r\nand material. The more thoroughly this plan is considered, the more\r\neconomical and effective will be the work. Having already obtained the\r\nneeded information, and having it all before us, we can determine exactly\r\nthe location and size of each drain, and arrange, before hand, for a rapid\r\nand satisfactory execution of the work. The only thing that may interfere\r\nwith the perfect application of the plan, is the presence of masses of\r\nunderground rock, within the depth to which the drains are to be laid.(5)\r\nWhere these are supposed to exist, soundings should be made, by driving a\r\n3/4-inch pointed iron rod to the rock, or to a depth of _five_ feet where\r\nthe rock falls away. By this means, measuring the distance from the\r\nsoundings to the ranges of the stakes, we can denote on the map the shape\r\nand depth of sunken rocks. The shaded spot on the east side of the map,\r\n(Fig. 8,) indicates a rock three feet from the surface, which will be\r\nassumed to have been explored by sounding.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it will be sufficient to have contour lines taken only at\r\nintervals of two feet, and, owing to the smallness of the scale on which\r\nthese maps are engraved, and to avoid complication in the finished plan,\r\nwhere so much else must be shown, each alternate line is omitted. Of\r\ncourse, where drains are at once staked out on the land, by a practiced\r\nengineer, no contour lines are taken, as by the aid of the level and rod\r\nfor the flatter portions, and by the eye alone for the steeper slopes, he\r\nwill be able at once to strike the proper locations and directions; but\r\nfor one of less experience, who desires to thoroughly mature his plan\r\nbefore commencing, they are indispensable; and their introduction here\r\nwill enable the novice to understand, more clearly than would otherwise be\r\npossible, the principles on which the plan should be made.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: Fig. 9 - WELL'S CLINOMETER.]\r\n\r\n                       Fig. 9 - WELL'S CLINOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor preliminary examinations, and for all purposes in which great accuracy\r\nis not required, the little instrument shown in Fig. 9,--\"Wells'\r\nClinometer,\"--is exceedingly simple and convenient. Its essential parts are\r\na flat side, or base, on which it stands, and a hollow disk just half\r\nfilled with some heavy liquid. The glass face of the disk is surrounded by\r\na graduated scale that marks the angle at which the surface of the liquid\r\nstands, with reference to the flat base. The line 0.----0. being parallel to\r\nthe base, when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is\r\nhorizontal; the line 90.----90. being perpendicular to the base, when the\r\nliquid stands on that line, the flat side is perpendicular or _plumb_. In\r\nlike manner, the intervening angles are marked, and, by the aid of the\r\nfollowing tables, the instrument indicates the rate of fall per hundred\r\nfeet of horizontal measurement, and per hundred feet measured upon the\r\nsloping line.(6)\r\n\r\nTable No. 1 shows the rise of the slope for 100 feet of the horizontal\r\nmeasurement. Example: If the horizontal distance is 100 feet, and the\r\nslope is at an angle of 15 deg., the rise will be 17-633/1000 feet.\r\n\r\nTable No. 2 shows the rise of the slope for 100 feet of its own length. If\r\nthe sloping line, (at an angle of 15 deg.,) is 100 feet long, it rises 25.882\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n TABLE No. 1.\r\nDEG.

Where, and at what depth, shall the outlet be placed?\r\n\r\n2. What shall be the location, the length and the depth of the main drain?\r\n\r\n3. What subsidiary mains,--or collecting drains,--shall connect the minor\r\nvalleys with the main?\r\n\r\n4. What may best be done to collect the water of large springs and carry\r\nit away?\r\n\r\n5. What provision is necessary to collect the water that flows over the\r\nsurface of out-cropping rock, or along springy lines on side hills or\r\nunder banks?\r\n\r\n6. What should be the depth, the distance apart, the direction, and the\r\nrate of _fall_, of the lateral drains?\r\n\r\n7. What kind and sizes of tile should be used to form the conduits?\r\n\r\n8. What provision should be made to prevent the obstruction of the drains,\r\nby an accumulation of silt or sand, which may enter the tiles immediately\r\nafter they are laid, and before the earth becomes compacted about them;\r\nand from the entrance of vermin?\r\n\r\n1. The outlet should be at the lowest point of the boundary, unless, (for\r\nsome especial reason which does not exist in the case under consideration,\r\nnor in any usual case,) it is necessary to seek some other than the\r\nnatural outfall; and it should be deep enough to take the water of the\r\nmain drain, and laid on a sufficient inclination for a free flow of the\r\nwater. It should, where sufficient fall can be obtained without too great\r\ncost, deliver this water over a step of at least a few inches in height,\r\nso that the action of the drain may be seen, and so that it may not be\r\nliable to be clogged by the accumulation of silt, (or mud,) in the open\r\nditch into which it flows.\r\n\r\n2. The main drain should, usually, be run as nearly in the lowest part of\r\nthe principal valley as is consistent with tolerable straightness. It is\r\nbetter to cut across the point of a hill, to the extent of increasing the\r\ndepth for a few rods, than to go a long distance out of the direct course\r\nto keep in the valley, both because of the cost of the large tile used in\r\nthe main, and of the loss of fall occasioned by the lengthening of the\r\nline. The main should be continued from the outlet to the point at which\r\nit is most convenient to collect the more remote sub-mains, which bring\r\ntogether the water of several sets of laterals. As is the case in the\r\ntract under consideration, the depth of the main is often restricted, in\r\nnearly level land, toward the upper end of the flat which lies next to the\r\noutlet, by the necessity for a fall and the difficulty which often exists\r\nin securing a sufficiently low outlet. In such case, the only rule is to\r\nmake it as deep as possible. When the fall is sufficient, it should be\r\nplaced at such depth as will allow the laterals and sub-mains which\r\ndischarge into it to enter at its top, and discharge above the level of\r\nthe water which flows through it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10 - STONE PIT TO CONNECT SPRING WITH DRAIN.]\r\n\r\n          Fig. 10 - STONE PIT TO CONNECT SPRING WITH DRAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Subsidiary mains, or _sub-mains_, connecting with the main drains,\r\nshould be run up the minor valleys of the land, skirting the bases of the\r\nhills. Where the valley is a flat one, with rising ground at each side,\r\nthere should be a sub-main, to receive the laterals from _each_ hill side.\r\nAs a general rule, it may be stated, that the collecting drain at the foot\r\nof a slope should be placed on the line which is first reached by the\r\nwater flowing directly down over its surface, before it commences its\r\nlateral movement down the valley; and it should, if possible, be so\r\narranged that it shall have a uniform descent for its whole distance. The\r\nproper arrangement of these collecting drains requires more skill and\r\nexperience than any other branch of the work, for on their disposition\r\ndepends, in a great measure, the economy and success of the undertaking.\r\n\r\n4. Where springs exist, there should be some provision made for collecting\r\ntheir water in pits filled with loose stone, gravel, brush or other\r\nrubbish, or furnished with several lengths of tile set on end, one above\r\nthe other, or with a barrel or other vessel; and a line of tile of proper\r\nsize should be run directly to a main, or sub-main drain. The manner of\r\ndoing this by means of a pit filled with stone is shown in Fig. 10. The\r\ncollection of spring water in a vertical tile basin is shown in Fig. 11.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11 - STONE AND TILE BASIN FOR SPRING WITH DRAIN.]\r\n\r\n            Fig. 11 - STONE AND TILE BASIN FOR SPRING WITH DRAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Where a ledge of shelving rock, of considerable size, occurs on land to\r\nbe drained, it is best to make some provision for collecting, at its base,\r\nthe water flowing over its surface, and taking it at once into the drains,\r\nso that it may not make the land near it unduly wet. To effect this, a\r\nditch should be dug along the base of the rock, and _quite down to it_,\r\nconsiderably deeper than the level of the proposed drainage; and this\r\nshould be filled with small stones to that level, with a line of tile laid\r\non top of the stones, a uniform bottom for the tile to rest upon being\r\nformed of cheap strips of board. The tile and stone should then be covered\r\nwith inverted sods, with wood shavings, or with other suitable material,\r\nwhich will prevent the entrance of earth, (from the covering of the\r\ndrain,) to choke them. The water, following down the surface of the rock,\r\nwill rise through the stone work and, entering the tile, will flow off.\r\nThis method may be used for springy hill sides.\r\n\r\n6. The points previously considered relate only to the collection of\r\nunusual quantities of water, (from springs and from rock surfaces,) and to\r\nthe removal from the land of what is thus collected, and of that which\r\nflows from the minor or lateral drains.\r\n\r\nThe _lateral drains_ themselves constitute the real drainage of the field,\r\nfor, although main lines take water from the land on each side, their\r\naction in this regard is not usually considered, in determining either\r\ntheir depth or their location, and they play an exceedingly small part in\r\nthe more simple form of drainage,--that in which a large tract of land, of\r\nperfectly uniform slope, is drained by parallel lines of equal length, all\r\ndischarging into a single main, running across the foot of the field. The\r\nland would be equally well drained, if the parallel lines were continued\r\nto an open ditch beyond its boundary,--the main tile drain is only adopted\r\nfor greater convenience and security. It will simplify the question if, in\r\ntreating the _theory_ of lateral drains, it be assumed that our field is\r\nof this uniform inclination, and admits of the use of long lines of\r\nparallel drains. In fact, it is best in practice to approximate as nearly\r\nas possible to this arrangement, because deviations from it, though always\r\nnecessary in broken land, are always more expensive, and present more\r\ncomplicated engineering problems. If all the land to be drained had a\r\nuniform fall, in a single direction, there would be but little need of\r\nengineering skill, beyond that which is required to establish the depth,\r\nfall, and distance apart, at which the drains should be laid. It is\r\nchiefly when the land pitches in different directions, and with varying\r\ninclination, that only a person skilled in the arrangement of drains, or\r\none who will give much consideration to the subject, can effect the\r\ngreatest economy by avoiding unnecessary complication, and secure the\r\ngreatest efficiency by adjusting the drains to the requirements of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAssuming the land to have an unbroken inclination, so as to require only\r\nparallel drains, it becomes important to know how these parallel drains,\r\n(corresponding to the _lateral drains_ of an irregular system,) should be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe history of land draining is a history of the gradual progress of an\r\nimprovement, from the accomplishment of a single purpose, to the\r\naccomplishment of several purposes, and most of the instruction which\r\nmodern agricultural writers have given concerning it, has shown too great\r\ndependence upon the teachings of their predecessors, who considered well\r\nthe single object which they sought to attain, but who had no conception\r\nthat draining was to be so generally valuable as it has become. The\r\neffort, (probably an unconscious one,) to make the theories of modern\r\nthorough-draining conform to those advanced by the early practitioners,\r\nseems to have diverted attention from some more recently developed\r\nprinciples, which are of much importance. For example, about a hundred\r\nyears ago, Joseph Elkington, of Warwickshire, discovered that, where land\r\nis made too wet by under-ground springs, a skillful tapping of\r\nthese,--drawing off their water through suitable conduits,--would greatly\r\nrelieve the land, and for many years the Elkington System of drainage,\r\nbeing a great improvement on every thing theretofore practiced, naturally\r\noccupied the attention of the agricultural world, and the Board of\r\nAgriculture appointed a Mr. Johnstone to study the process, and write a\r\ntreatise on the subject.\r\n\r\nCatch-water drains, made so as to intercept a flow of surface water, have\r\nbeen in use from immemorial time, and are described by the earliest\r\nwriters. Before the advent of the Draining Tile, covered drains were\r\nfurnished with stones, boards, brush, weeds, and various other rubbish,\r\nand their good effect, very properly, claimed the attention of all\r\nimprovers of wet land. When the tile first made its appearance in general\r\npractice, it was of what is called the \"horse-shoe\" form, and,--imperfect\r\nthough it was,--it was better than anything that had preceded it, and was\r\nreceived with high approval, wherever it became known. The general use of\r\nall these materials for making drains was confined to a system of\r\n_partial_ drainage, until the publication of a pamphlet, in 1833, by Mr.\r\nSmith, of Deanston, who advocated the drainage of the whole field, without\r\nreference to springs. From this plan, but with important modifications in\r\nmatters of detail, the modern system of tile draining has grown. Many able\r\nmen have aided its progress, and have helped to disseminate a knowledge of\r\nits processes and its effects, yet there are few books on draining, even\r\nthe most modern ones, which do not devote much attention to Elkington's\r\ndiscovery; to the various sorts of stone and brush drains; and to the\r\nmanufacture and use of horse-shoe tile;--not treating them as matters of\r\nantiquarian interest, but repeating the instructions for their\r\napplication, and allowing the reasoning on which their early use was\r\nbased, to influence, often to a damaging extent, their general\r\nconsideration of the modern practice of tile draining.\r\n\r\nThese processes are all of occasional use, even at this day, but they are\r\nbased on no fixed rules, and are so much a matter of traditional\r\nknowledge, with all farmers, that instruction concerning them is not\r\nneeded. The kind of draining which is now under consideration, has for its\r\nobject the complete removal of all of the surplus water that reaches the\r\nsoil, from whatever source, and the assimilation of all wet soils to a\r\nsomewhat uniform condition, as to the ease with which water passes through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere are instances, as has been shown, where a large spring, overflowing\r\na considerable area, or supplying the water of an annoying brook, ought to\r\nbe directly connected with the under-ground drainage, and its flow neatly\r\ncarried away; and, in other cases, the surface flow over large masses of\r\nrock should be given easy entrance into the tile; but, in all ordinary\r\nlands, whether swamps, springy hill sides, heavy clays, or light soils\r\nlying on retentive subsoil, all ground, in fact, which needs\r\nunder-draining at all, should be laid dry above the level to which it is\r\ndeemed best to place the drains;--not only secured against the wetting of\r\nsprings and soakage water, but rapidly relieved of the water of heavy\r\nrains. The water table, in short, should be lowered to the proper depth,\r\nand, by permanent outlets at that depth, be prevented from ever rising,\r\nfor any considerable time, to a higher level. This being accomplished, it\r\nis of no consequence to know whence the water comes, and Elkington's\r\nsystem need have no place in our calculations. As round pipes, with\r\ncollars, are far superior to the \"horse-shoe\" tiles, and are equally easy\r\nto obtain, it is not necessary to consider the manner in which these\r\nlatter should be used,--only to say that they ought not to be used at all.\r\n\r\nThe water which falls upon the surface is at once absorbed, settles\r\nthrough the ground, until it reaches a point where the soil is completely\r\nsaturated, and raises the general water level. When this level reaches the\r\nfloor of the drains, the water enters at the joints and is carried off.\r\nThat which passes down through the land lying between the drains, bears\r\ndown upon that which has already accumulated in the soil, and forces it to\r\nseek an outlet by rising into the drains.(7) For example, if a barrel,\r\nstanding on end, be filled with earth which is saturated with water, and\r\nits bung be removed, the water of saturation, (that is, all which is not\r\nheld by attraction _in_ the particles of earth,) will be removed from so\r\nmuch of the mass as lies above the bottom of the bung-hole. If a bucket of\r\nwater be now poured upon the top, it will not all run diagonally toward\r\nthe opening; it will trickle down to the level of the water remaining in\r\nthe barrel, and this level will rise and water will run off at the bottom\r\nof the orifice. In this manner, the water, even below the drainage level,\r\nis changed with each addition at the surface. In a barrel filled with\r\ncoarse pebbles, the water of saturation would maintain a nearly level\r\nsurface; if the material were more compact and retentive, a true level\r\nwould be attained only after a considerable time. Toward the end of the\r\nflow, the water would stand highest at the points furthest distant from\r\nthe outlet. So, in the land, after a drenching rain, the water is first\r\nremoved to the full depth, near the line of the drain, and that midway\r\nbetween two drains settles much more slowly, meeting more resistance from\r\nbelow, and, for a long time, will remain some inches higher than the floor\r\nof the drain. The usual condition of the soil, (except in very dry\r\nweather,) would be somewhat as represented in the accompanying cut, (Fig.\r\n12.)\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Fig. 12 - LINE OF SATURATION BETWEEN DRAINS.]\r\n\r\n               Fig. 12 - LINE OF SATURATION BETWEEN DRAINS.\r\n\r\n _YY are the draings. The curved line b is the line of saturation, which\r\n               has descended from a, and is approaching c._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo provide for this deviation of the line of saturation, in practice,\r\ndrains are placed deeper than would be necessary if the water sunk at once\r\nto the level of the drain floor, the depth of the drains being increased\r\nwith the increasing distance between them.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, every drop of water which falls on a field should sink\r\nstraight down to the level of the drains, and force a drop of water below\r\nthat level to rise into the drain and flow off. How exactly this is true\r\nin nature cannot be known, and is not material. Drains made in pursuance\r\nof this theory will be effective for any actual condition.\r\n\r\nThe _depth_ to which the water table should be withdrawn depends, not at\r\nall on the character of the soil, but on the requirements of the crops\r\nwhich are to be grown upon it, and these requirements are the same in all\r\nsoils,--consequently the depth should be the same in all.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, shall that depth be? The usual practice of the most\r\nexperienced drainers seems to have fixed four feet as about the proper\r\ndepth, and the arguments against anything less than this, as well as some\r\nreasons for supposing that to be sufficient, are so clearly stated by Mr.\r\nGisborne that it has been deemed best to quote his own words on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\"Take a flower-pot a foot deep, filled with dry soil. Place it in a saucer\r\ncontaining three inches of water. The first effect will be, that the water\r\nwill rise through the hole in the bottom of the pot till the water which\r\nfills the interstices between the soil is on a level with the water in the\r\nsaucer. This effect is by gravity. The upper surface of this water is our\r\nwater-table. From it water will ascend by attraction through the whole\r\nbody of soil till moisture is apparent at the surface. Put in your soil at\r\n60 deg., a reasonable summer heat for nine inches in depth, your water at 47 deg.,\r\nthe seven inches' temperature of Mr. Parke's undrained bog; the attracted\r\nwater will ascend at 47 deg., and will diligently occupy itself in attempting\r\nto reduce the 60 deg. soil to its own temperature. Moreover, no sooner will\r\nthe soil hold water of attraction, than evaporation will begin to carry it\r\noff, and will produce the cold consequent thereon. This evaporated water\r\nwill be replaced by water of attraction at 47 deg., and this double cooling\r\nprocess will go on till all the water in the water-table is exhausted.\r\nSupply water to the saucer as fast as it disappears, and then the process\r\nwill be perpetual. The system of saucer-watering is reprobated by every\r\nintelligent gardener; it is found by experience to chill vegetation;\r\nbesides which, scarcely any cultivated plant can dip its roots into\r\nstagnant water with impunity. Exactly the process which we have described\r\nin the flower-pot is constantly in operation on an undrained retentive\r\nsoil; the water-table may not be within nine inches of the surface, but in\r\nvery many instances it is within a foot or eighteen inches, at which level\r\nthe cold surplus oozes into some ditch or other superficial outlet. At\r\neighteen inches, attraction will, on the average of soils, act with\r\nconsiderable power. Here, then, you have two obnoxious principles at work,\r\nboth producing cold, and the one administering to the other. The obvious\r\nremedy is, to destroy their _united_ action; to break through their line\r\nof communication. Remove your water of attraction to such a depth that\r\nevaporation cannot act upon it, or but feebly. What is that depth? In\r\nascertaining this point we are not altogether without data. No doubt depth\r\ndiminishes the power of evaporation rapidly. Still, as water taken from a\r\n30-inch drain is almost invariably two or three degrees colder than water\r\ntaken from four feet, and as this latter is generally one or two degrees\r\ncolder than water from a contiguous well several feet below, we can hardly\r\navoid drawing the conclusion that the cold of evaporation has considerable\r\ninfluence at 30 inches, a much-diminished influence at four feet, and\r\nlittle or none below that depth. If the water-table is removed to the\r\ndepth of four feet, when we have allowed 18 inches of attraction, we shall\r\nstill have 30 inches of defence against evaporation; and we are inclined\r\nto believe that any prejudicial combined action of attraction and\r\nevaporation is thereby well guarded against. The facts stated seem to\r\nprove that less will not suffice.\r\n\r\n\"So much on the score of temperature; but this is not all. Do the roots of\r\nesculents wish to penetrate into the earth--at least, to the depth of some\r\nfeet? We believe that they do. We are sure of the brassica tribe, of\r\ngrass, and clover. All our experience and observation deny the doctrine\r\nthat roots only ramble when they are stinted of food; that six inches well\r\nmanured is quite enough, better than more. Ask the Jerseyman; he will show\r\nyou a parsnip as thick as your thigh, and as long as your leg, and will\r\ntell you of the advantages of 14 feet of dry soil. You will hear of\r\nparsnips whose roots descend to unsearchable depths. We will not appeal to\r\nthe Kentucky carrot, which was drawn out by its roots at the antipodes;\r\nbut Mr. Mechi's, if we remember right, was a dozen feet or more. Three\r\nyears ago, in a midland county, a field of good land, in good cultivation,\r\nand richly manured, produced a heavy crop of cabbages. In November of that\r\nyear we saw that field broken into in several places, and at the depth of\r\nfour feet the soil (a tenacious marl, fully stiff enough for brick-earth)\r\nwas occupied by the roots of cabbage, not sparingly--not mere capillae--but\r\nfibres of the size of small pack-thread. A farmer manures a field of four\r\nor five inches of free soil reposing on a retentive clay, and sows it with\r\nwheat. It comes up, and between the kernel and the manure, it looks well\r\nfor a time, but anon it sickens. An Irish child looks well for five or six\r\nyears, but after that time potato-feeding, and filth, and hardship, begin\r\nto tell. You ask what is amiss with the wheat, and you are told that when\r\nits roots reach the clay, they are poisoned. This field is then\r\nthorough-drained, deep, at least four feet. It receives again from the\r\ncultivator the previous treatment; the wheat comes up well, maintains\r\nthroughout a healthy aspect, and gives a good return. What has become of\r\nthe poison? We have been told that the rain water filtered through the\r\nsoil has taken it into solution or suspension, and has carried it off\r\nthrough the drains; and men who assume to be of authority put forward this\r\nas one of the advantages of draining. If we believed it, we could not\r\nadvocate draining. We really should not have the face to tell our readers\r\nthat water, passing through soils containing elements prejudicial to\r\nvegetation, would carry them off, but would leave those which are\r\nbeneficial behind. We cannot make our water so discriminating; the general\r\nmerit of water of deep drainage is, that it contains very little. Its\r\nperfection would be that it should contain nothing. We understand that\r\nexperiments are in progress which have ascertained that water, charged\r\nwith matters which are known to stimulate vegetation, when filtered\r\nthrough four feet of retentive soil, comes out pure. But to return to our\r\nwheat. In the first case, it shrinks before the cold of evaporation and\r\nthe cold of water of attraction, and it sickens because its feet are never\r\ndry; it suffers the usual maladies of cold and wet. In the second case,\r\nthe excess of cold by evaporation is withdrawn; the cold water of\r\nattraction is removed out of its way; the warm air from the surface,\r\nrushing in to supply the place of the water which the drains remove, and\r\nthe warm summer rains, bearing down with them the temperature which they\r\nhave acquired from the upper soil, carry a genial heat to its lowest\r\nroots. Health, vigorous growth, and early maturity are the natural\r\nconsequences. * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"The practice so derided and maligned referring to deep draining has\r\nadvanced with wonderful strides. We remember the days of 15 inches; then a\r\nstep to 20; a stride to 30; and the last (and probably final) jump to 50,\r\na few inches under or over. We have dabbled in them all, generally\r\nbelonging to the deep section of the day. We have used the words 'probably\r\nfinal,' because the first advances were experimental, and, though they\r\nwere justified by the results obtained, no one attempted to explain the\r\nprinciple on which benefit was derived from them. The principles on which\r\nthe now prevailing depth is founded, and which we believe to be true, go\r\nfar to show that we have attained all the advantages which can be derived\r\nfrom the removal of water in ordinary agriculture. We do not mean that,\r\neven in the most retentive soil, water would not get into drains which\r\nwere laid somewhat deeper; but to this there must be a not very distant\r\nlimit, because pure clay, lying below the depth at which wet and drought\r\napplied at surface would expand and contract it, would certainly part with\r\nits water very slowly. We find that, in coal mines and in deep quarries, a\r\nstratum of clay of only a few inches thick interposed between two strata\r\nof pervious stone will form an effectual bar to the passage of water;\r\nwhereas, if it lay within a few feet of the surface, it would, in a season\r\nof heat and drought become as pervious as a cullender. But when we have\r\ngot rid of the cold arising from the evaporation of free water, have given\r\na range of several feet to the roots of grass and cereals, and have\r\nenabled retentive land to filter through itself all the rain which falls\r\nupon its surface, we are not, in our present state of knowledge, aware of\r\nany advantage which would arise from further lowering the surface of water\r\nin agricultural land. Smith, of Deanston, first called prominent attention\r\nto the fertilizing effects of rain filtered through land, and to evils\r\nproduced by allowing it to flow off the surface. Any one will see how much\r\nmore effectually this benefit will be attained, and this evil avoided, by\r\na 4-foot than a 2-foot drainage. The latter can only prepare two feet of\r\nsoil for the reception and retention of rain, which two feet, being\r\nsaturated, will reject more, and the surplus must run off the surface,\r\ncarrying whatever it can find with it. A 4-foot drainage will be\r\nconstantly tending to have four feet of soil ready for the reception of\r\nrain, and it will take much more rain to saturate four feet than two.\r\nMoreover, as a gimlet-hole bored four feet from the surface of a barrel\r\nfilled with water will discharge much more in a given time than a similar\r\nhole bored at the depth of two feet, so will a 4-foot drain discharge in a\r\ngiven time much more water than a drain of two feet. One is acted on by a\r\n4-foot, and the other by a 2-foot pressure.\"\r\n\r\nIf any single fact connected with tile-drainage is established, beyond all\r\npossible doubt, it is that in the stiffest clay soils ever cultivated,\r\ndrains four feet deep will act effectually; the water will find its way to\r\nthem, more and more freely and completely, as the drying of successive\r\nyears, and the penetration and decay of the roots of successive crops,\r\nmodify the character of the land, and they will eventually be practically\r\nso porous that,--so far as the ease of drainage is concerned,--no\r\ndistinction need, in practice, be made between them and the less retentive\r\nloams. For a few years, the line of saturation between the drains, as\r\nshown in Fig. 11, may stand at all seasons considerably above the level of\r\nthe bottom of the tile, but it will recede year by year, until it will be\r\npractically level, except immediately after rains.\r\n\r\nMr. Josiah Parkes recommends drains to be laid\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_At a minimum depth of four feet_, designed with the two-fold\r\n    object of not only freeing the active soil from stagnant and\r\n    injurious water, but of converting the water falling on the\r\n    surface into an agent for fertilizing; no drainage being deemed\r\n    efficient that did not both remove the water falling on the\r\n    surface, and 'keep down the subterranean water at a depth\r\n    exceeding the power of capillary attraction to elevate it near the\r\n    surface.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlderman Mechi says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Ask nineteen farmers out of twenty, who hold strong clay land,\r\n    and they will tell you it is of no use placing deep four-foot\r\n    drains in such soils--the water cannot get in; a horse's foot-hole\r\n    (without an opening under it) will hold water like a basin; and so\r\n    on. Well, five minutes after, you tell the same farmers you\r\n    propose digging a cellar, well bricked, six or eight feet deep;\r\n    what is their remark? 'Oh! it's of no use your making an\r\n    underground cellar in our soil, you _can't keep the water_ OUT!'\r\n    Was there ever such an illustration of prejudice as this? What is\r\n    a drain pipe but a small cellar full of air? Then, again, common\r\n    sense tells us, you can't keep a light fluid under a heavy one.\r\n    You might as well try to keep a cork under water, as to try and\r\n    keep air under water. 'Oh! but then our soil isn't porous.' If\r\n    not, how can it hold water so readily? I am led to these\r\n    observations by the strong controversy I am having with some Essex\r\n    folks, who protest that I am mad, or foolish, for placing 1-inch\r\n    pipes, at four-foot depth, in strong clays. It is in vain I refer\r\n    to the numerous proofs of my soundness, brought forward by Mr.\r\n    Parkes, engineer to the Royal Agricultural Society, and confirmed\r\n    by Mr. Pusey. They still dispute it. It is in vain I tell them _I\r\n    cannot keep the rainwater out of_ socketed pipes, twelve feet\r\n    deep, that convey a spring to my farm yard. Let us try and\r\n    convince this large class of doubters; for it is of _national_\r\n    importance. Four feet of good porous clay would afford a far\r\n    better meal to some strong bean, or other tap roots, than the\r\n    usual six inches; and a saving of $4 to $5 per acre, in drainage,\r\n    is no trifle.\r\n\r\n    \"The shallow, or non-drainers, assume that tenacious subsoils are\r\n    impervious or non-absorbent. This is entirely an erroneous\r\n    assumption. If soils were impervious, how could they get wet?\r\n\r\n    \"I assert, and pledge my agricultural reputation for the fact,\r\n    that there are no earths or clays in this kingdom, be they ever so\r\n    tenacious, that will not readily receive, filter, and transmit\r\n    rain water to drains placed five or more feet deep.\r\n\r\n    \"A neighbor of mine drained twenty inches deep in strong clay; the\r\n    ground cracked widely; the contraction destroyed the tiles, and\r\n    the rains washed the surface soils into the cracks and choked the\r\n    drains. He has since abandoned shallow draining.\r\n\r\n    \"When I first began draining, I allowed myself to be overruled by\r\n    my obstinate man, Pearson, who insisted that, for top water, two\r\n    feet was a sufficient depth in a veiny soil. I allowed him to try\r\n    the experiment on two small fields; the result was, that nothing\r\n    prospered; and I am redraining those fields at _one-half_ the\r\n    cost, five and six feet deep, at intervals of 70 and 80 feet.\r\n\r\n    \"I found iron-sand rocks, strong clay, silt, iron, etc., and an\r\n    enormous quantity of water, all _below_ the 2-foot drains. This\r\n    accounted at once for the sudden check the crops always met with\r\n    in May, when they wanted to send their roots down, but could not,\r\n    without going into stagnant water.\"\r\n\r\n    \"There can be no doubt that it is the _depth_ of the drain which\r\n    regulates the escape of the surface water in a given time; regard\r\n    being had, as respects extreme distances, to the nature of the\r\n    soil, and a due capacity of the pipe. _The deeper the drain, even\r\n    in the strongest soils, the quicker the water escapes._ This is an\r\n    astounding but certain fact.\r\n\r\n    \"That deep and distant drains, where a sufficient fall can be\r\n    obtained, are by far the most profitable, by affording to the\r\n    roots of the plants a greater range for food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, where the soil is underlaid by rock, less than four feet from\r\nthe surface; and where an outlet at that depth cannot be obtained, we\r\nmust, per force, drain less deeply, but where there exists no such\r\nobstacle, drains should be laid at a _general_ depth of\r\nfour-feet,--general, not uniform, because the drain should have a uniform\r\ninclination, which the surface of the land rarely has.\r\n\r\n*The Distance between the Drains.*--Concerning this, there is less\r\nunanimity of opinion among engineers, than prevails with regard to the\r\nquestion of depth.\r\n\r\nIn tolerably porous soils, it is generally conceded that 40 or even 50\r\nfeet is sufficiently near for 4-foot drains, but, for the more retentive\r\nclays, all distances from 18 feet to 50 feet are recommended, though those\r\nwho belong to the more narrow school are, as a rule, extending the limit,\r\nas they see, in practice, the complete manner in which drains at wider\r\nintervals perform their work. A careful consideration of the experience of\r\nthe past twenty years, and of the arguments of writers on drainage, leads\r\nto the belief that there are few soils, which need draining at all, on\r\nwhich it will be safe to place 4-foot drains at much wider intervals than\r\n40 feet. In the lighter loams there are many instances of the successful\r\napplication of Professor Mapes' rule, that \"3-foot drains should be placed\r\n20 feet apart, and for each additional foot in depth the distance may be\r\ndoubled; for instance, 4-foot drains should be 40 feet apart, and 5-foot\r\ndrains 80 feet apart.\" But, with reference to the greater distance, (80\r\nfeet,) it is not to be recommended in stiff clays, for any depth of drain.\r\nWhere it is necessary, by reason of insufficient fall, or of underground\r\nrock, to go only three feet deep, the drains should be as near together as\r\n20 feet.\r\n\r\nAt first thought, it may seem akin to quackery to recommend a uniform\r\ndepth and distance, without reference to the character of the land to be\r\ndrained; and it is unquestionably true that an exact adaptation of the\r\nwork to the varying requirements of different soils would be beneficial,\r\nthough no system can be adopted which will make clay drain as freely as\r\nsand. The fact is, that the adjustment of the distances between drains is\r\nvery far from partaking of the nature of an exact science, and there is\r\nreally very little known, by any one, of the principles on which it should\r\nbe based, or of the manner in which the bearing of those principles, in\r\nany particular case, is affected by several circumstances which vary with\r\neach change of soil, inclination and exposure.\r\n\r\nIn the essays on drainage which have been thus far published, there is a\r\nvagueness in the arguments on this branch of the subject, which betrays a\r\nwant of definite conviction in the minds of the writers; and which tends\r\nquite as much to muddle as to enlighten the ideas of the reader. In so far\r\nas the directions are given, whether fortified by argument or not, they\r\nare clearly empirical, and are usually very much qualified by\r\nconsiderations which weigh with unequal force in different cases.\r\n\r\nIn laying out work, any skillful drainer will be guided, in deciding the\r\ndistance between the lines, by a judgment which has grown out of his\r\nformer experience; and which will enable him to adapt the work,\r\nmeasurably, to the requirements of the particular soil under\r\nconsideration; but he would probably find it impossible to so state the\r\nreasons for his decision, that they would be of any general value to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nProbably it will be a long time before rules on this subject, based on\r\nwell sustained _theory_, can be laid down with distinctness, and, in the\r\nmean time, we must be guided by the results of practice, and must confine\r\nourselves to a distance which repeated trial, in various soils, has proven\r\nto be safe for all agricultural land. In the drainage of the Central Park,\r\nafter a mature consideration of all that had been published on the\r\nsubject, and of a considerable previous observation and experience, it was\r\ndecided to adopt a general depth of four feet, and to adhere as closely as\r\npossible to a uniform distance of forty feet. No instance was known of a\r\nfailure to produce good results by draining at that distance, and several\r\ncases were recalled where drains at fifty and sixty feet had proved so\r\ninefficient that intermediate lines became necessary. After from seven to\r\nten years' trial, the Central Park drainage, by its results, has shown\r\nthat,--although some of the land is of a very retentive character,--this\r\ndistance is not too great; and it is adopted here for recommendation to\r\nall who have no especial reason for supposing that greater distances will\r\nbe fully effective in their more porous soils.\r\n\r\nAs has been before stated, drains at that distance, (or at any distance,)\r\nwill not remove all of the water of saturation from heavy clays so rapidly\r\nas from more porous soil; but, although, in some cases, the drainage may\r\nbe insufficient during the first year, and not absolutely perfect during\r\nthe second and third years, the increased porosity which drainage causes,\r\n(as the summer droughts make fissures in the earth, as decayed roots and\r\nother organic deposits make these fissures permanent, and as chemical\r\naction in the aerated soil changes its character,) will finally bring clay\r\nsoils to as perfect a condition as they are capable of attaining, and will\r\ninvariably render them excellent for cultivation.\r\n\r\n*The Direction of the Laterals* should be _right up and down the slope of\r\nthe land_, in the line of steepest descent. For a long time after the\r\ngeneral adoption of thorough-draining, there was much discussion of this\r\nsubject, and much variation in practice. The influence of the old rules\r\nfor making surface or \"catch-water\" drains lasted for a long time, and\r\nthere was a general tendency to make tile drains follow the same\r\ndirections. An important requirement of these was that they should not\r\ntake so steep an inclination as to have their bottoms cut out and their\r\nbanks undermined by the rapid flow of water, and that they should arrest\r\nand carry away the water flowing down over the surface of hill sides. The\r\narguments for the line of steepest descent were, however, so clear, and\r\ndrains laid on that line were so universally successful in practice, that\r\nit was long ago adopted by all,--save those novices who preferred to gain\r\ntheir education in draining in the expensive school of their own\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe more important reasons why this direction is the best are the\r\nfollowing: First, it is the quickest way to get the water off. Its natural\r\ntendency is to run straight down the hill, and nothing is gained by\r\ndiverting it from this course. Second, if the drain runs obliquely down\r\nthe hill, the water will be likely to run out at the joints of the tile\r\nand wet the ground below it; even if it do not, mainly, run past the drain\r\nfrom above into the land below, instead of being forced into the tile.\r\nThird, a drain lying obliquely across a hillside will not be able to draw\r\nthe water from below up the hill toward it, and the water of nearly the\r\nwhole interval will have to seek its outlet through the drain below it.\r\nFourth, drains running directly down the hill will tap any porous water\r\nbearing strata, which may crop out, at regular intervals, and will thus\r\nprevent the spewing out of the water at the surface, as it might do if\r\nonly oblique drains ran for a long distance just above or just below them.\r\nVery steep, and very springy hill sides, sometimes require very frequent\r\ndrains to catch the water which has a tendency to flow to the surface;\r\nthis, however, rarely occurs.\r\n\r\nIn laying out a plan for draining land of a broken surface, which inclines\r\nin different directions, it is impossible to make the drains follow the\r\nline of steepest descent, and at the same time to have them all parallel,\r\nand at uniform distances. In all such cases a compromise must be made\r\nbetween the two requirements. The more nearly the parallel arrangement can\r\nbe preserved, the less costly will the work be, while the more nearly we\r\nfollow the steepest slope of the ground, the more efficient will each\r\ndrain be. No rule for this adjustment can be given, but a careful study of\r\nthe plan of the ground, and of its contour lines, will aid in its\r\ndetermination. On all irregular ground it requires great skill to secure\r\nthe greatest efficiency consistent with economy.\r\n\r\nThe _fall_ required in well made tile drains is very much less than would\r\nbe supposed, by an inexperienced person, to be necessary. Wherever\r\npracticable, without too great cost, it is desirable to have a fall of one\r\nfoot in one hundred feet, but more than this in ordinary work is not\r\nespecially to be sought, although there is, of course, no objection to\r\nvery much greater inclination.\r\n\r\nOne half of that amount of fall, or six inches in one hundred feet, is\r\nquite sufficient, if the execution of the work is carefully attended to.\r\n\r\nThe least rate of fall which it is prudent to give to a drain, in using\r\nordinary tiles, is 2.5 in 1,000, or three inches in one hundred feet, and\r\neven this requires very careful work.(8) A fall of six inches in one\r\nhundred feet is recommended whenever it can be easily obtained--not as\r\nbeing more effective, but as requiring less precision, and consequently\r\nless expense.\r\n\r\n*Kinds and Sizes of Tiles.*--Agricultural drain-tiles are made of clay\r\nsimilar to that which is used for brick. When burned, they are from twelve\r\ninches to fourteen inches long, with an interior diameter of from one to\r\neight inches, and with a thickness of wall, (depending on the strength of\r\nthe clay, and the size of the bore,) of from one-quarter of an inch to\r\nmore than an inch. They are porous, to the extent of absorbing a certain\r\namount of water, but their porosity has nothing to do with their use for\r\ndrainage,--for this purpose they might as well be of glass. The water\r\nenters them, not through their walls, but at their joints, which cannot be\r\nmade so tight that they will not admit the very small amount of water that\r\nwill need to enter at each space. Gisborne says:\r\n\r\n\"If an acre of land be intersected with parallel drains twelve yards\r\napart, and if on that acre should fall the very unusual quantity of one\r\ninch of rain in twelve hours, in order that every drop of this rain may be\r\ndischarged by the drains in forty-eight hours from the commencement of the\r\nrain--(and in a less period that quantity neither will, not is it desirable\r\nthat it should, filter through an agricultural soil)--the interval between\r\ntwo pipes will be called upon to pass two-thirds of a tablespoonful of\r\nwater per minute, and no more. Inch pipes, lying at a small inclination,\r\nand running only half-full, will discharge more than double this quantity\r\nof water in forty-eight hours.\"\r\n\r\nTiles may be made of any desired form of section,--the usual forms are the\r\n\"horse-shoe,\" the \"sole,\" the \"double-sole,\" and the \"round.\" The latter\r\nmay be used with collars, and they constitute the \"pipes and collars,\"\r\nfrequently referred to in English books on drainage.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: Fig. 13 - HORSE-SHOE TILE.]\r\n\r\n                      Fig. 13 - HORSE-SHOE TILE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horse-shoe tiles_, Fig. 13, are condemned by all modern engineers. Mr.\r\nGisborne disposes of them by an argument of some length, the quotation of\r\nwhich in these pages is probably advisable, because they form so much\r\nbetter conduits than stones, and to that extent have been so successfully\r\nemployed, that they are still largely used in this country by \"amateurs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"We shall shock some and surprise many of our readers, when we\r\n    state confidently that, in average soils, and, still more, in\r\n    those which are inclined to be tender, horse shoe tiles form the\r\n    weakest and most failing conduit which has ever been used for a\r\n    deep drain. It is so, however; and a little thought, even if we\r\n    had no experience, will tell us that it must be so. A doggrel\r\n    song, quite destitute of humor, informs us that tiles of this sort\r\n    were used in 1760 at Grandesburg Hall, in Suffolk, by Mr. Charles\r\n    Lawrence, the owner of the estate. The earliest of which we had\r\n    experience were of large area and of weak form. Constant failures\r\n    resulted from their use, and the cause was investigated; many of\r\n    the tiles were found to be choked up with clay, and many to be\r\n    broken longitudinally through the crown. For the first evil, two\r\n    remedies were adopted; a sole of slate, of wood, or of its own\r\n    material, was sometimes placed under the tile, but the more usual\r\n    practice was to form them with club-feet. To meet the case of\r\n    longitudinal fracture, the tiles were reduced in size, and very\r\n    much thickened in proportion to their area. The first of these\r\n    remedies was founded on an entirely mistaken, and the second on no\r\n    conception at all of the cause of the evil to which they were\r\n    respectively applied. The idea was, that this tile, standing on\r\n    narrow feet, and pressed by the weight of the refilled soil, sank\r\n    into the floor of the drain; whereas, in fact, the floor of the\r\n    drain rose into the tile. Any one at all conversant with\r\n    collieries is aware that when a _strait_ work (which is a small\r\n    subterranean tunnel six feet high and four feet wide or\r\n    thereabouts) is driven in coal, the rising of the floor is a more\r\n    usual and far more inconvenient occurrence than the falling of the\r\n    roof: the weight of the two sides squeezes up the floor. We have\r\n    seen it formed into a very decided arch without fracture. Exactly\r\n    a similar operation takes place in the drain. No one had till\r\n    recently dreamed of forming a tile drain, the bottom of which a\r\n    man was not to approach personally within twenty inches or two\r\n    feet. To no one had it then occurred that width at the bottom of\r\n    the drain was a great evil. For the convenience of the operator\r\n    the drain was formed with nearly perpendicular sides, of a width\r\n    in which he could stand and work conveniently, shovel the bottom\r\n    level with his ordinary spade, and lay the tiles by his hand; the\r\n    result was a drain with nearly perpendicular sides, and a wide\r\n    bottom. No sort of clay, particularly when softened by water\r\n    standing on it or running over it, could fail to rise under such\r\n    circumstances; and the deeper the drain the greater the pressure\r\n    and the more certain the rising. A horse-shoe tile, which may be a\r\n    tolerable secure conduit in a drain of two feet, in one of four\r\n    feet becomes an almost certain failure. As to the longitudinal\r\n    fracture--not only is the tile subject to be broken by one of those\r\n    slips which are so troublesome in deep draining, and to which the\r\n    lightly-filled material, even when the drain is completed, offers\r\n    an imperfect resistance, but the constant pressure together of the\r\n    sides, even when it does not produce a fracture of the soil,\r\n    catches hold of the feet of the tile, and breaks it through the\r\n    crown. Consider the case of a drain formed in clay when dry, the\r\n    conduit a horse-shoe tile. When the clay expands with moisture, it\r\n    necessarily presses on the tile and breaks it through the crown,\r\n    its weakest part.(9) When the Regent's Park was first drained,\r\n    large conduits were in fashion, and they were made circular by\r\n    placing one horse-shoe tile upon another. It would be difficult to\r\n    invent a weaker conduit. On re-drainage, innumerable instances\r\n    were found in which the upper tile was broken through the crown,\r\n    and had dropped into the lower. Next came the D form, tile and\r\n    sole in one, and much reduced in size--a great advance; and when\r\n    some skillful operator had laid this tile bottom upwards we were\r\n    evidently on the eve of pipes. For the D tile a round pipe moulded\r\n    with a flat-bottomed solid sole is now generally substituted, and\r\n    is an improvement; but is not equal to pipes and collars, nor\r\n    generally cheaper than they are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: Fig. 14 - SOLE TILE.]\r\n\r\n                         Fig. 14 - SOLE TILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne chief objection to the _Sole-tiles_ is, that, in the drying which they\r\nundergo, preparatory to the burning, the upper side is contracted, by the\r\nmore rapid drying, and they often require to be trimmed off with a hatchet\r\nbefore they will form even tolerable joints; another is, that they cannot\r\nbe laid with collars, which form a joint so perfect and so secure, that\r\ntheir use, in the smaller drains, should be considered indispensable.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: Fig. 15 - DOUBLE-SOLE TILE.]\r\n\r\n                         Fig. 15 - DOUBLE-SOLE TILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _double-sole tiles_, which can be laid either side up give a much\r\nbetter joint, but they are so heavy as to make the cost of transporation\r\nconsiderably greater. They are also open to the grave objection that they\r\ncannot be fitted with collars.\r\n\r\nExperience, in both public and private works in this country, and the\r\ncumulative testimony of English and French engineers, have demonstrated\r\nthat the only tile which it is economical to use, is the _best_ that can\r\nbe found, and that the best,--much the best--thus far invented, is the\r\n\"pipe, or round tile, and collar,\"--and these are unhesitatingly\r\nrecommended for use in all cases. Round tiles of small sizes should not be\r\nlaid without collars, as the ability to use these constitutes their chief\r\nadvantage; holding them perfectly in place, preventing the rattling in of\r\nloose dirt in laying, and giving twice the space for the entrance of water\r\nat the joints. A chief advantage of the larger sizes is, that they may be\r\nlaid on any side and thus made to fit closely. The usual sizes of these\r\ntiles are 1-1/4 inches, 2-1/4 inches, and 3-1/2 inches in interior\r\ndiameter. Sections of the 2-1/4 inch make collars for the 1-1/4 inch, and\r\nsections of the 3-1/2 inch make collars for the 2-1/4 inch. The 3-1/2 inch\r\nsize does not need collars, as it is easily secured in place, and is only\r\nused where the flow of water would be sufficient to wash out the slight\r\nquantity of foreign matters that might enter at the joints.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16 - ROUND TILE AND COLLAR, AND THE SAME AS LAID.]\r\n\r\n            Fig. 16 - ROUND TILE AND COLLAR, AND THE SAME AS LAID.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The size of tile* to be used is a question of consequence. In England,\r\n1-inch pipes are frequently used, but 1-1/4 inch(10) are recommended for\r\nthe smallest drains. Beyond this limit, the proper size to select is, _the\r\nsmallest that can convey the water which will ordinarily reach it after a\r\nheavy rain_. The smaller the pipe, the more concentrated the flow, and,\r\nconsequently, the more thoroughly obstructions will be removed, and the\r\noccasional flushing of the pipe, when it is taxed, for a few hours, to its\r\nutmost capacity, will insure a thorough cleansing. No inconvenience can\r\nresult from the fact that, on rare occasions, the drain is unable, for a\r\nshort time, to discharge all the water that reaches it, and if collars are\r\nused, or if the clay be well packed about the pipes, there need be no fear\r\nof the tile being displaced by the pressure. An idea of the drying\r\ncapacity of a 1-1/4-inch tile may be gained from observing its _wetting_\r\ncapacity, by connecting a pipe of this size with a sufficient body of\r\nwater, at its surface, and discharging, over a level dry field, all the\r\nwater which it will carry. A 1-1/4-inch pipe will remove all the water\r\nwhich would fall on an acre of land in a very heavy rain, in 24\r\nhours,--much less time than the water would occupy in getting to the tile,\r\nin any soil which required draining; and tiles of this size are ample for\r\nthe draining of two acres. In like manner, 2-1/2-inch tile will suffice\r\nfor eight, and 3-1/2-inch tile for twenty acres. The foregoing estimates\r\nare, of course, made on the supposition that only the water which falls on\r\nthe land, (storm water,) is to be removed. For main drains, when greater\r\ncapacity is required, two tiles may be laid, (side by side,) or in such\r\ncases the larger sizes of sole tiles may be used, being somewhat cheaper.\r\nWhere the drains are laid 40 feet apart, about 1,000 tiles per acre will\r\nbe required, and, in estimating the quantity of tiles of the different\r\nsizes to be purchased, reference should be had to the following figures;\r\nthe first 2,000 feet of drains require a collecting drain of 2-1/4-inch\r\ntile, which will take the water from 7,000 feet; and for the outlet of\r\nfrom 7,000 to 20,000 feet 3-1/2-inch tile may be used. Collars, being more\r\nsubject to breakage, should be ordered in somewhat larger quantities.\r\n\r\nOf course, such guessing at what is required, which is especially\r\nuncertain if the surface of the ground is so irregular as to require much\r\ndeviation from regular parallel lines, is obviated by the careful\r\npreparation of a plan of the work, which enables us to measure,\r\nbeforehand, the length of drain requiring the different sizes of conduit,\r\nand, as tiles are usually made one or two inches more than a foot long, a\r\nthousand of them will lay a thousand feet,--leaving a sufficient allowance\r\nfor breakage, and for such slight deviations of the lines as may be\r\nnecessary to pass around those stones which are too large to remove. In\r\nvery stony ground, the length of lines is often materially increased, but\r\nin such ground, there is usually rock enough or such accumulations of\r\nboulders in some parts, to reduce the length of drain which it is possible\r\nto lay, at least as much as the deviations will increase it.\r\n\r\nIt is always best to make a contract for tile considerably in advance. The\r\nprices which are given in the advertisements of the makers, are those at\r\nwhich a single thousand,--or even a few hundred,--can be purchased, and very\r\nconsiderable reductions of price may be secured on large orders.\r\nEspecially is this the case if the land is so situated that the tile may\r\nbe purchased at either one of two tile works,--for the prices of all are\r\nextravagantly high, and manufacturers will submit to large discounts\r\nrather than lose an important order.\r\n\r\nIt is especially recommended, in making the contract, to stipulate that\r\nevery tile shall be hard-burned, and that those which will not give a\r\n_clear ring_ when struck with a metallic instrument, shall be rejected,\r\nand the cost of their transportation borne by the maker. The tiles used in\r\nthe Central Park drainage were all tested with the aid of a bit of steel\r\nwhich had, at one end, a cutting edge. With this instrument each tile was\r\n\"sounded,\" and its hardness was tested by scraping the square edge of the\r\nbore. If it did not \"ring\" when struck, or if the edge was easily cut, it\r\nwas rejected. From the first cargo there were many thrown out, but as soon\r\nas the maker saw that they were really inspected, he sent tile of good\r\nquality only. Care should also be taken that no _over-burned_ tile,--such\r\nas have been melted and warped, or very much contracted in size by too\r\ngreat heat,--be smuggled into the count.\r\n\r\nA little practice will enable an ordinary workman to throw out those which\r\nare imperfect, and, as a single tile which is so underdone that it will\r\nnot last, or which, from over-burning, has too small an orifice, may\r\ndestroy a long drain, or a whole system of drains, the inspection should\r\nbe thorough.\r\n\r\nThe collars should be examined with equal care. Concerning the use of\r\nthese, Gisborne says:\r\n\r\n\"To one advantage which is derived from the use of collars we have not yet\r\nadverted--the increased facility with which free water existing in the soil\r\ncan find entrance into the conduit. The collar for a 1-1/2-inch pipe has a\r\ncircumference of three inches. The whole space between the collar and the\r\npipe on each side of the collar is open, and affords no resistance to the\r\nentrance of water; while at the same time the superincumbent arch of the\r\ncollar protects the junction of two pipes from the intrusion of particles\r\nof soil. We confess to some original misgivings that a pipe resting only\r\non an inch at each end, and lying hollow, might prove weak and liable to\r\nfracture by weight pressing on it from above; but the fear was illusory.\r\nSmall particles of soil trickle down the sides of every drain, and the\r\nfirst flow of water will deposit them in the vacant space between the two\r\ncollars. The bottom, if at all soft, will also swell up into any vacancy.\r\nPractically, if you reopen a drain well laid with pipes and collars, you\r\nwill find them reposing in a beautiful nidus, which, when they are\r\ncarefully removed, looks exactly as if it had been moulded for them.\"\r\n\r\nThe cost of collars should not be considered an objection to their use;\r\nbecause, without collars it would not be safe, (as it is difficult to make\r\nthe orifices of two pieces come exactly opposite to each other,) to use\r\nless than 2-inch tiles, while, with collars, 1-1/4-inch are sufficient for\r\nthe same use, and, including the cost of collars, are hardly more\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nIt is usual, in all works on agricultural drainage, to insert tables and\r\nformulae for the guidance of those who are to determine the size of tile\r\nrequired to discharge the water of a certain area. The practice is not\r\nadopted here, for the reason that all such tables are without practical\r\nvalue. The smoothness and uniformity of the bore; the rate of fall; the\r\ndepth of the drain, and consequent \"head,\" or pressure, of the water; the\r\ndifferent effects of different soils in retarding the flow of the water to\r\nthe drain; the different degrees to which angles in the line of tile\r\naffect the flow; the degree of acceleration of the flow which is caused by\r\ngreater or less additions to the stream at the junction of branch drains;\r\nand other considerations, arising at every step of the calculation, render\r\nit impossible to apply delicate mathematical rules to work which is, at\r\nbest, rude and unmathematical in the extreme. In sewerage, and the water\r\nsupply of towns, such tables are useful,--though, even in the most perfect\r\nof these operations, engineers always make large allowances for\r\ncircumstances whose influence cannot be exactly measured,--but in land\r\ndrainage, the ordinary rules of hydraulics have to be considered in so\r\nmany different bearings, that the computations of the books are not at all\r\nreliable. For instance, Messrs. Shedd & Edson, of Boston, have prepared a\r\nseries of tables, based on Smeaton's experiments, for the different sizes\r\nof tile, laid at different inclinations, in which they state that\r\n1-1/2-inch tile, laid with a fall of one foot in a length of one hundred\r\nfeet, will discharge 12,054.81 gallons of water in 24 hours. This is equal\r\nto a rain-fall of over 350 inches per year on an acre of land. As the\r\naverage annual rain-fall in the United States is about 40 inches, at least\r\none-half of which is removed by evaporation, it would follow, from this\r\ntable, that a 1-1/2-inch pipe, with the above named fall, would serve for\r\nthe drainage of about 17 acres. But the calculation is again disturbed by\r\nthe fact that the rain-fall is not evenly distributed over all the days of\r\nthe year,--as much as six inches having been known to fall in a single 24\r\nhours, (amounting to about 150,000 gallons per acre,) and the removal of\r\nthis water in a single day would require a tile nearly five inches in\r\ndiameter, laid at the given fall, or a 3-inch tile laid at a fall of more\r\nthan 7-1/2 feet in 100 feet. But, again, so much water could not reach a\r\ndrain four feet from the surface, in so short a time, and the time\r\nrequired would depend very much on the character of the soil. Obviously,\r\nthen, these tables are worthless for our purpose. Experience has fully\r\nshown that the sizes which are recommended below are ample for practical\r\npurposes, and probably the areas to be drained by the given sizes might be\r\ngreatly increased, especially with reference to such soils as do not allow\r\nwater to percolate very freely through them.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject, attention is called to the following\r\nextract from the Author's Report on the Drainage, which accompanies the\r\n\"Third Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of the Central Park:\"\r\n\r\n\"In order to test the efficiency of the system of drainage employed on the\r\nPark, I have caused daily observations to be taken of the amount of water\r\ndischarged from the principal drain of 'the Green,' and have compared it\r\nwith the amount of rain-fall. A portion of the record of those\r\nobservations is herewith presented.\r\n\r\n\"In the column headed 'Rain-Fall,' the amount of water falling on one acre\r\nduring the entire storm, is given in gallons. This is computed from the\r\nrecord of a rain-gauge kept on the Park.\r\n\r\n\"Under the head of 'Discharge,' the number of gallons of water drained\r\nfrom one acre during 24 hours is given. This is computed from observations\r\ntaken, once a day or oftener, and supposes the discharge during the entire\r\nday to be the same as at the time of taking the observations. It is,\r\nconsequently, but approximately correct:\r\n\r\nDate.       Hour.         Rain-fall.   Discharge.   Remarks.\r\nJuly 13.    10     a.m.   49,916       184 galls.

The greatest recorded discharge in\r\n24 hours was (August 25th,) less than 100,000 gallons from the ten\r\nacres,--an amount of water which did not half fill the tile, but which,\r\naccording to the tables referred to, would have entirely filled it.\r\n\r\nIn view of all the information that can be gathered on the subject, the\r\nfollowing directions are given as perfectly reliable for drains four feet\r\nor more in depth, laid on a well regulated fall of even three inches in a\r\nhundred feet:\r\n\r\nFor   2 acres   1-1/4 inch pipes (with collars.)\r\n\r\nFor   8 acres   2-1/4 inch pipes (with collars.)\r\n\r\nFor  20 acres   3-1/2 inch pipes\r\n\r\nFor  40 acres 2 3-1/2 inch pipes or one 5-inch sole-tile.\r\n\r\nFor  50 acres       6 inch pipes sole-tile.\r\n\r\nFor 100 acres       8 inch pipes or two 6-inch sole-tiles.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that these drains will immediately remove all the\r\nwater of the heaviest storms, but they will always remove it fast enough\r\nfor all practical purposes, and, if the pipes are securely laid, the\r\ndrains will only be benefited by the occasional cleansing they will\r\nreceive when running \"more than full.\" In illustration of this statement,\r\nthe following is quoted from a paper communicated by Mr. Parkes to the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society of England in 1843:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thomas Hammond, of Penshurst, (Kent,) now uses no other size for the\r\nparallel drains than the inch tile in the table, (No. 5,) having commenced\r\nwith No. 4,(11) and it may be here stated, that the opinion of all the\r\nfarmers who have used them in the Weald, is that a bore of an inch area is\r\nabundantly large. A piece of 9 acres, now sown with wheat, was observed by\r\nthe writer, 36 hours after the termination of a rain which fell heavily\r\nand incessantly during 12 hours on the 7th of November. This field was\r\ndrained in March, 1842, to the depth of 30 to 36 inches, at a distance of\r\n24 feet asunder, the length of each drain being 235 yards.\r\n\r\n\"Each, drain emptied itself through a fence bank into a running stream in\r\na road below it; the discharge therefore was distinctly observable. Two or\r\nthree of the pipes had now ceased running; and, with the exception of one\r\nwhich tapped a small spring and gave a stream about the size of a tobacco\r\npipe, the run from the others did not exceed the size of a wheat straw.\r\nThe greatest flow had been observed by Mr. Hammond at no time to exceed\r\nhalf the bore of the pipes. The fall in this field is very great, and the\r\ndrains are laid in the direction of the fall, which has always been the\r\npractice in this district. The issuing water was transparently clear; and\r\nMr. Hammond states that he has never observed cloudiness, except for a\r\nshort time after very heavy flushes of rain, when the drains are quickly\r\ncleared of all sediment, in consequence of the velocity and force of the\r\nwater passing through so small a channel. Infiltration through the soil\r\nand into the pipes, must, in this case, be considered to have been\r\nperfect; and their observed action is the more determinate and valuable as\r\nregards time and effect, as the land was saturated with moisture previous\r\nto this particular fall of rain, and the pipes had ceased to run when it\r\ncommenced. This piece had, previous to its drainage, necessarily been\r\ncultivated in narrow stretches, with an open water furrow between them;\r\nbut it was now laid quite plain, by which one-eighth of the continuation\r\nof acreage has been saved. Not, however, being confident as to the soil\r\nhaving already become so porous as to dispense entirely with surface\r\ndrains, Mr. Hammond had drawn two long water furrows diagonally across the\r\nfield. On examining these, it appeared that very little water had flowed\r\nalong any part of them during these 12 hours of rain,--no water had escaped\r\nat their outfall; the entire body of rain had permeated the mass of the\r\nbed, and passed off through the inch pipes; no water perceptible on the\r\nsurface, which used to carry it throughout. The subsoil is a brick clay,\r\nbut it appears to crack very rapidly by shrinkage consequent to drainage.\"\r\n\r\n*Obstructions.*--The danger that drains will become obstructed, if not\r\nproperly laid out and properly made, is very great, and the cost of\r\nremoving the obstructions, (often requiring whole lines to be taken up,\r\nwashed, and relaid with the extra care that is required in working in old\r\nand soft lines,) is often greater than the original cost of the\r\nimprovement. Consequently, the possibility of tile drains becoming stopped\r\nup should be fully considered at the outset, and every precaution should\r\nbe taken to prevent so disastrous a result.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes of obstruction are _silt, vermin_, and _roots_.\r\n\r\n_Silt_ is earth which is washed into the tile with the water of the soil,\r\nand which, though it may be carried along in suspension in the water, when\r\nthe fall is good, will be deposited in the eddies and slack-water, which\r\noccur whenever there is a break in the fall, or a defect in the laying of\r\nthe tile.\r\n\r\n_Whenever it is possible to avoid it, no drain should have a decreasing\r\nrate of fall as it approaches its outlet._\r\n\r\nIf the first hundred feet from the upper end of the drain has a fall of\r\nthree inches, the next hundred feet should not have less than three\r\ninches, lest the diminished velocity cause silt, which required the speed\r\nwhich that fall gives for its removal, to be deposited and to choke the\r\ntile. This defect of grade is shown in Fig. 17. If the second hundred feet\r\nhas an inclination of _more_ than three inches, (Fig. 18,) the removal of\r\nsilt will be even better secured than if the fall continued at the\r\noriginal rate. Some silt will enter newly made drains, in spite of our\r\nutmost care, but the amount should be very slight, and if it is evenly\r\ndeposited throughout the whole length of the drain, (as it sometimes is\r\nwhen the rate of fall is very low,) it will do no especial harm; but it\r\nbecomes dangerous when it is accumulated within a short distance, by a\r\ndecreasing fall, or by a single badly laid tile, or imperfect joint,\r\nwhich, by arresting the flow, may cause as much mischief as a defective\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\nOwing to the general conformation of the ground, it is sometimes\r\nabsolutely necessary to adopt such a grade as is shown in Fig. 19,--even to\r\nthe extent of bringing the drain down a rapid slope, and continuing it\r\nwith the least possible fall through level ground. When such changes must\r\nbe made, they should be effected by angles, and not by curves. In\r\n_increasing_ the fall, curves in the grade are always advisable, in\r\n_decreasing_ it they are always objectionable, except when the decreased\r\nfall is still considerable,--say, at least 2 feet in 100 feet. The reason\r\nfor making an absolute angle at the point of depression is, that it\r\nenables us to catch the silt at that point in a silt basin, from which it\r\nmay be removed as occasion requires.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 19 - THREE PROFILES OF DRAINS, WITH DIFFERENT\r\n                              INCLINATIONS.]\r\n\r\n     Fig. 19 - THREE PROFILES OF DRAINS, WITH DIFFERENT INCLINATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Silt Basin_ is a chamber, below the grade of the drain, into which the\r\nwater flows, becomes comparatively quiet, and deposits its silt, instead\r\nof carrying it into the tile beyond. It may be large or small, in\r\nproportion to the amount of drain above, which it has to accommodate. For\r\na few hundred feet of the smallest tile, it may be only a 6-inch tile\r\nplaced on end and sunk so as to receive and discharge the water at its\r\ntop. For a large main, it may be a brick reservoir with a capacity of 2 or\r\n3 cubic feet. The position of a silt basin is shown in Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of silt which enters the drain depends very much on the soil.\r\nCompact clays yield very little, and wet, running sands, (quicksands,) a\r\ngreat deal. In a soil of the latter sort, or one having a layer of running\r\nsand at the level of the drain, the ditch should be excavated a little\r\nbelow the grade of the drain, and then filled to that level with a\r\nretentive clay, and rammed hard. In all cases when the tile is well laid,\r\n(especially if collars are used,) and a stiff earth is well packed around\r\nthe tile, silt will not enter the drain to an injurious extent, after a\r\nfew months' operation shall have removed the loose particles about the\r\njoints, and especially after a few very heavy rains, which, if the tiles\r\nare small, will sometimes wash them perfectly clean, although they may\r\nhave been half filled with dirt.\r\n\r\n_Vermin_,--field mice, moles, etc.,--sometimes make their nests in the tile\r\nand thus choke them, or, dying in them, stop them up with their carcases.\r\nTheir entrance should be prevented by placing a coarse wire cloth or\r\ngrating in front of the outlets, which afford the only openings for their\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\n_Roots._--The roots of many water-loving trees,--especially willows,--will\r\noften force their entrance into the joints of the tile and fill the whole\r\nbore with masses of fibre which entirely prevent the flow of water.\r\nCollars make it more difficult for them to enter, but even these are not a\r\nsure preventive. Gisborne says:\r\n\r\n\"My own experience as to roots, in connection with deep pipe draining, is\r\nas follows: I have never known roots to obstruct a pipe through which\r\nthere was not a perennial stream. The flow of water in summer and early\r\nautumn appears to furnish the attraction. I have never discovered that the\r\nroots of any esculent vegetable have obstructed a pipe. The trees which,\r\nby my own personal observation, I have found to be most dangerous, have\r\nbeen red willow, black Italian poplar, alder, ash, and broad-leaved elm. I\r\nhave many alders in close contiguity with important drains, and, though I\r\nhave never convicted one, I cannot doubt that they are dangerous. Oak, and\r\nblack and white thorns, I have not detected, nor do I suspect them. The\r\nguilty trees have in every instance been young and free growing; I have\r\nnever convicted an adult. These remarks apply solely to my own\r\nobservation, and may of course be much extended by that of other\r\nagriculturists. I know an instance in which a perennial spring of very\r\npure and (I believe) soft water is conveyed in socket pipes to a paper\r\nmill. Every junction of two pipes is carefully fortified with cement. The\r\nonly object of cover being protection from superficial injury and from\r\nfrost, the pipes are laid not far below the sod. Year by year these pipes\r\nare stopped by roots. Trees are very capricious in this matter. I was told\r\nby the late Sir R. Peel that he sacrificed two young elm trees in the park\r\nat Drayton Manor to a drain which had been repeatedly stopped by roots.\r\nThe stoppage was nevertheless repeated, and was then traced to an elm tree\r\nfar more distant than those which had been sacrificed. Early in the autumn\r\nof 1850 I completed the drainage of the upper part of a boggy valley,\r\nlying, with ramifications, at the foot of marly banks. The main drains\r\nconverge to a common outlet, to which are brought one 3-inch pipe and\r\nthree of 4 inches each. They lie side by side, and water flows perennially\r\nthrough each of them. Near to this outlet did grow a red willow. In\r\nFebruary, 1852, I found the water breaking out to the surface of the\r\nground about 10 yards above the outlet, and was at no loss for the cause,\r\nas the roots of the red willow showed themselves at the orifice of the\r\n3-inch and of two of the 4-inch pipes. On examination I found that a root\r\nhad entered a joint between two 3-inch pipes, and had traveled 5 yards to\r\nthe mouth of the drain, and 9 yards up the stream, forming a continuous\r\nlength of 14 yards. The root which first entered had attained about the\r\nsize of a lady's little finger; and its ramifications consisted of very\r\nfine and almost silky fibres, and would have cut up into half a dozen\r\ncomfortable boas. The drain was completely stopped. The pipes were not in\r\nany degree displaced. Roots from the same willow had passed over the\r\n3-inch pipes, and had entered and entirely stopped the first 4-inch drain,\r\nand had partially stopped the second. At a distance of about 50 yards a\r\nblack Italian poplar, which stood on a bank over a 4-inch drain, had\r\ncompletely stopped it with a bunch of roots. The whole of this had been\r\nthe work of less than 18 months, including the depth of two winters. A\r\n3-inch branch of the same system runs through a little group of black\r\npoplars. This drain conveys a full stream in plashes of wet, and some\r\nwater generally through the winter months, but has not a perennial flow. I\r\nhave perceived no indication that roots have interfered with this drain. I\r\ndraw no general conclusions from these few facts, but they may assist\r\nthose who have more extensive experience in drawing some, which may be of\r\nuse to drainers.\"\r\n\r\nHaving considered some of the principles on which our work should be\r\nbased, let us now return to the map of the field, and apply those\r\nprinciples in planning the work to be done to make it dry.\r\n\r\n*The Outlet* should evidently be placed at the present point of exit of\r\nthe brook which runs from the springs, collects the water of the open\r\nditches, and spreads over the flat in the southwest corner of the tract,\r\nconverting it into a swamp. Suppose that, by going some distance into the\r\nnext field, we can secure an outlet of 3 feet and 9 inches (3.75) below\r\nthe level of the swamp, and that we decide to allow 3 inches drop between\r\nthe bottom of the tile at that point, and the reduced level of the brook\r\nto secure the drain against the accumulation of sand, which might result\r\nfrom back water in time of heavy rain. This fixes the depth of drain at\r\nthe outlet at 3-1/2 (3.50) feet.\r\n\r\nAt that side of the swamp which lies nearest to the main depression of the\r\nup-land, (See Fig. 21,) is the proper place at which to collect the water\r\nfrom so much of the field as is now drained by the main brook, and at that\r\npoint it will be well to place a _silt basin_ or well, built up to the\r\nsurface, which may, at any time, be uncovered for an observation of the\r\nworking of the drains. The land between this point and the outlet is\r\nabsolutely level, requiring the necessary fall in the drain which connects\r\nthe two, to be gained by raising the upper end of it. As the distance is\r\nnearly 200 feet, and as it is advisable to give a fall at least\r\nfive-tenths of a foot per hundred feet to so important an outlet as this,\r\nthe drain at the silt basin may be fixed at only 2-1/2 feet. The basin\r\nbeing at the foot of a considerable rise in the ground, it will be easy,\r\nwithin a short distance above, to carry the drains which come to it to a\r\ndepth of 4 feet,--were this not the case, the fall between the basin and\r\nthe outlet would have to be very much reduced.\r\n\r\n*Main Drains.*--The valley through which the brook now runs is about 80\r\nfeet wide, with a decided rise in the land at each side. If one main drain\r\nwere laid in the center of it, all of the laterals coming to the main\r\nwould first run down a steep hillside, and then across a stretch of more\r\nlevel land, requiring the grade of each lateral to be broken at the foot\r\nof the hill, and provided with a silt basin to collect matters which might\r\nbe deposited when the fall becomes less rapid. Consequently, it is best to\r\nprovide two mains, or collecting drains, (_A_ and _C_,) one lying at the\r\nfoot of each hill, when they will receive the laterals at their greatest\r\nfall; but, as these are too far apart to completely drain the valley\r\nbetween them, and are located on land higher than the center of the\r\nvalley, a drain, (_B_,) should be run up, midway between them.\r\n\r\nThe collecting drain, _A_, will receive the laterals from the hill to the\r\nwest of it, as far up as the 10-foot contour line, and, above that\r\npoint,--running up a branch of the valley,--it will receive laterals from\r\nboth sides. The drain, _B_, may be continued above the dividing point of\r\nthe valley, and will act as one of the series of laterals. The drain, _C_,\r\nwill receive the laterals and sub-mains from the rising ground to the east\r\nof it, and from both sides of the minor valley which extends in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nMost of the valley which runs up from the easterly side of the swamp must\r\nbe drained independently by the drain _E_, which might be carried to the\r\nsilt basin, did not its continuation directly to the outlet offer a\r\nshorter course for the removal of its water. This drain will receive\r\nlaterals from the hill bordering the southeasterly side of the swamp, and,\r\nhigher up, from both sides of the valley in which it runs.\r\n\r\nIn laying out these main drains, more attention should be given to placing\r\nthem where they will best receive the water of the laterals, and on lines\r\nwhich offer a good and tolerably uniform descent, than to their use for\r\nthe immediate drainage of the land through which they pass. Afterward, in\r\nlaying out the laterals, the use of these lines as local drains should, of\r\ncourse, be duly considered.\r\n\r\n*The Lateral Drains* should next receive attention, and in their location\r\nand arrangement the following rules should be observed:\r\n\r\n1st. They should run down the steepest descent of the land.\r\n\r\n2d. They should be placed at intervals proportionate to their depth;--if 4\r\nfeet deep, at 40 feet intervals; if 3 feet deep, at 20 feet intervals.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Fig. 20 - MAP WITH DRAINS AND CONTOUR LINES.]\r\n\r\n               Fig. 20 - MAP WITH DRAINS AND CONTOUR LINES.\r\n\r\n\r\n3d. They should, as nearly as possible, run parallel to each other.\r\n\r\nOn land of perfectly uniform character, (all sloping in the same\r\ndirection,) all of these requirements may be complied with, but on\r\nirregular land it becomes constantly necessary to make a compromise\r\nbetween them. Drains running down the line of steepest descent cannot be\r\nparallel,--and, consequently, the intervals between them cannot be always\r\nthe same; those which are farther apart at one end than at the other\r\ncannot be always of a depth exactly proportionate to their intervals.\r\n\r\nIn the adjustment of the lines, so as to conform as nearly to these\r\nrequirements as the shape of the ground will allow, there is room for the\r\nexercise of much skill, and on such adjustment depend, in a great degree,\r\nthe success and economy of the work. Remembering that on the map, the line\r\nof steepest descent is exactly perpendicular to the contour lines of the\r\nland, it will be profitable to study carefully the system of drains first\r\nlaid out, erasing and making alterations wherever it is found possible to\r\nsimplify the arrangement.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, all _angles_ are, to a certain extent, wasteful,\r\nbecause, if two parallel drains will suffice to drain the land between\r\nthem, no better drainage will be effected by a third drain running across\r\nthat land. Furthermore, the angles are practically supplied with drains at\r\nless intervals than are required,--for instance, at _C 7 a_ on the map the\r\ntriangles included within the dotted line _x_, _y_, will be doubly\r\ndrained. So, also, if any point of a 4-foot drain will drain the land\r\nwithin 20 feet of it, the land included within the dotted line forming a\r\nsemi-circle about the point _C 14_, might drain into the end of the\r\nlateral, and it no more needs the action of the main drain than does that\r\nwhich lies between the laterals. Of course, angles and connecting lines\r\nare indispensable, except where the laterals can run independently across\r\nthe entire field, and discharge beyond it. The longer the laterals can be\r\nmade, and the more angles can be avoided, the more economical will the\r\narrangement be; and, until the arrangement of the lines has been made as\r\nnearly perfect as possible, the time of the drainer can be in no way so\r\nprofitably spent as in amending his plan.\r\n\r\nThe series of laterals which discharge through the mains _A_, _C_, _D_ and\r\n_E_, on the accompanying map, have been very carefully considered, and are\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of the reader, in illustration of what has\r\nbeen said above.\r\n\r\nAt one point, just above the middle of the east side of the field, the\r\nlaterals are placed at a general distance of 20 feet, because, as will be\r\nseen by reference to Fig. 4, a ledge of rock, underground, will prevent\r\ntheir being made more than 3 feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe line from _H_ to _I_, (Fig. 20,) at the north side of the field,\r\nconnecting the heads of the laterals, is to be a stone and tile drain,\r\nsuch as is described on page 60, intended to collect the water which\r\nfollows the surface of the rock. (See Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nThe swamp is to be drained by itself, by means of two series of laterals\r\ndischarging into the main lines _F_ and _G_, which discharge at the\r\noutlet, by the side of the main drain from the silt-basin. By this\r\narrangement, these laterals, especially at the north side of the swamp,\r\nbeing accurately laid, with very slight inclinations, can be placed more\r\ndeeply than if they ran in an east and west direction, and discharged into\r\nthe main, which has a greater inclination, and is only two and a half feet\r\ndeep at the basin. Being 3-1/2 (3.50) feet deep at the outlet, they may be\r\nmade fully 3 feet deep at their upper ends, and, being only 20 feet apart,\r\nthey will drain the land as well as is possible. The drains being now laid\r\nout, over the whole field, the next thing to be attended to is\r\n\r\n*The Ordering of the Tile.*--The main line from the outlet up to the\r\nsilt-basin, should be of 3-1/2-inch tiles, of which about 190 feet will be\r\nrequired. The main drain _A_ should be laid with 2-1/4-inch tiles to the\r\npoint marked _m_, near its upper end, as the lateral entering there\r\ncarries the water of a spring, which is supposed to fill a 1-1/4-inch\r\ntile. The length of this drain, from the silt-basin to that point is 575\r\nfeet. The main drain _C_ will require 2-1/4 inch tiles from the silt-basin\r\nto the junction with the lateral, which is marked _C_ 10, above which\r\npoint there is about 1,700 feet of drain discharging into it, a portion of\r\nwhich, being a stone-and-tile drain at the foot of a rock, may be supposed\r\nto receive more water than that which lies under the rest of the\r\nland;--distance 450 feet. The main drain _E_ requires 2-1/4-inch tiles from\r\nthe outlet to the point marked _o_, a distance of 380 feet. This tile\r\nwill, in addition to its other work, carry as much water from the spring,\r\non the line of its fourth lateral, as would fill a 1-1/4-inch pipe.(12)\r\n\r\nThe length of the main drains above the points indicated, and of all the\r\nlaterals, amounts to about 12,250 feet. These all require 1-1/4-inch\r\ntiles.\r\n\r\nAllowing about five per cent. for breakage, the order in round numbers,\r\nwill be as follows:(13)\r\n\r\n3-1/2-inch round tiles      200 feet.\r\n\r\n2-1/4-inch round tiles    1,500 feet.\r\n\r\n1-1/4-inch round tiles   13,000 feet.\r\n\r\n3-1/2-inch round tiles    1,600\r\n\r\n2-1/4-inch round tiles   13,250\r\n\r\nOrder, also, 25 6-inch sole-tiles, to be used in making small silt-basins.\r\n\r\nIt should be arranged to have the tiles all on the ground before the work\r\nof ditching commences, so that there may be no delay and consequent danger\r\nto the stability of the banks of the ditches, while waiting for them to\r\narrive. As has been before stated, it should be especially agreed with the\r\ntile-maker, at the time of making the contract, that every tile should be\r\nperfect;--of uniform shape, and neither too much nor too little burned.\r\n\r\n*Staking Out.*--Due consideration having been given to such preliminaries\r\nas are connected with the mapping of the ground, and the arrangement, on\r\npaper, of the drains to be made, the drainer may now return to his field,\r\nand, while awaiting the arrival of his tiles, make the necessary\r\npreparation for the work to be done. The first step is to fix certain\r\nprominent points, which will serve to connect the map with the field, by\r\nactual measurements, and this will very easily be done by the aid of the\r\nstakes which are still standing at the intersections of the 50-foot lines,\r\nwhich were used in the preliminary levelling.\r\n\r\nCommencing at the southwest corner of the field, and measuring toward the\r\neast a distance of 34 feet, set a pole to indicate the position of the\r\noutlet. Next, mark the center of the silt-basin at the proper point, which\r\nwill be found by measuring 184 feet up the western boundary, and thence\r\ntoward the east 96 feet, on a line parallel with the nearest row of\r\n50-foot stakes. Then, in like manner, fix the points _C1_, _C6_, _C9_,\r\n_C10_, and _C17_, and the angles of the other main lines, marking the\r\nstakes, when placed, to correspond with the same points on the map. Then\r\nstake the angles and the upper ends of the laterals, and mark these stakes\r\nto correspond with the map.\r\n\r\nIt will greatly facilitate this operation, if the plan of the drains which\r\nis used in the field, from which the horizontal lines should be omitted,\r\nhave the intersecting 50-foot lines drawn upon it, so that the\r\nmeasurements may be made from the nearest points of intersection.(14)\r\n\r\nHaving staked these guiding points of the drains, it is advisable to\r\nremove all of the 50-foot stakes, as these are of no further use, and\r\nwould only cause confusion. It will now be easy to set the remaining\r\nstakes,--placing one at every 50 feet of the laterals, and at the\r\nintersections of all the lines.\r\n\r\nA system for marking the stakes is indicated on the map, (in the _C_\r\nseries of drains,) which, to avoid the confusion which would result from\r\ntoo much detail on such a small scale, has been carried only to the extent\r\nnecessary for illustration. The stakes of the line _C_ are marked _C1_,\r\n_C2_, _C3_, etc. The stakes of the sub-main _C7_, are marked _C7a_, _C7b_,\r\n_C7c_, etc. The stakes of the lateral which enters this drain at _C7a_,\r\nare marked _C7a/1_, _C7a/2_, _C7a/3,_ etc. etc. This system, which\r\nconnects the lettering of each lateral with its own sub-main and main, is\r\nperfectly simple, and avoids the possibility of confusion. The position of\r\nthe stakes should all be lettered on the map, at the original drawing, and\r\nthe same designating marks put on the stakes in the field, as soon as set.\r\n\r\n_Grade Stakes_, (pegs about 8 or 10 inches long,) should be placed close\r\nat the sides of the marked stakes, and driven nearly their full length\r\ninto the ground. The tops of these stakes furnish fixed points of\r\nelevation from which to take the measurements, and to make the\r\ncomputations necessary to fix the depth of the drain at each stake. If the\r\nmeasurements were taken from the surface of the ground, a slight change of\r\nposition in placing the instrument, would often make a difference of some\r\ninches in the depth of the drain.\r\n\r\n*Taking the Levels.*--For accurate work, it is necessary to ascertain the\r\ncomparative levels of the tops of all of the grade stakes; or the distance\r\nof each one of them below an imaginary horizontal plane. This plane, (in\r\nwhich we use only such lines as are directly above the drains,) may be\r\ncalled the \"Datum Line.\" Its elevation should be such that it will be\r\nabove the highest part of the land, and, for convenience, it is fixed at\r\nthe elevation of the levelling instrument when it is so placed as to look\r\nover the highest part of the field.\r\n\r\n_Levelling Instruments_ are of various kinds. The best for the work in\r\nhand, is the common railroad level, which is shown in Fig. 6. This is\r\nsupported on three legs, which bring it to about the level of the eye. Its\r\nessential parts are a telescope, which has two cross-hairs intersecting\r\neach other in the line of sight, and which may be turned on its pivot\r\ntoward any point of the horizon; a bubble glass placed exactly parallel to\r\nthe line of sight, and firmly secured in its position so as to turn with\r\nthe telescope; and an apparatus for raising or depressing any side of the\r\ninstrument by means of set-screws. The instrument is firmly screwed to the\r\ntripod, and placed at a point convenient for looking over a considerable\r\npart of the highest land. By the use of the set-screws, the plane in which\r\nthe instrument revolves is brought to a level, so that in whatever\r\ndirection the instrument is pointed, the bubble will be in the center of\r\nthe glass. The line of sight, whichever way it is turned, is now in our\r\nimaginary plane. A convenient position for the instrument in the field\r\nunder consideration, would be at the point, east of the center, marked\r\n_K_, which is about 3 feet below the level of the highest part of the\r\nground. The telescope should stand about 5 feet above the surface of the\r\nground directly under it.\r\n\r\n_The Levelling-Rod_, (See Fig. 7,) is usually 12 feet long, is divided\r\ninto feet and hundredths of a foot, and has a movable target which may be\r\nplaced at any part of its entire length. This is carried by an attendant,\r\nwho holds it perpendicularly on the top of the grade-stake, while the\r\noperator, looking through the telescope, directs him to move the target up\r\nand down until its center is exactly in the line of sight. The attendant\r\nthen reads the elevation, and the operator records it as the distance\r\nbelow the _datum-line_ of the top of the grade-stake. For convenience, the\r\nletterings of the stakes should be systematically entered in a small field\r\nbook, before the work commences, and this should be accompanied by such a\r\nsketch of the plan as will serve as a guide to the location of the lines\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nThe following is the form of the field book for the main drain _C_, with\r\nthe levels recorded:\r\n\r\nLETTERING OF THE STAKE.

As the simplest means of\r\nillustrating the principle on which this work should be done, it will be\r\nconvenient to go through with the process with reference to the main drain\r\n_C_, of the plan under consideration. A profile of this line is shown in\r\nFig. 21, where the line is broken at stake No. 7, and continued in the\r\nlower section of the diagram. The topmost line, from \"Silt Basin\" to \"17,\"\r\nis the horizontal datum-line. The numbers above the vertical lines\r\nindicate the stakes; the figures in brackets between these, the number of\r\nfeet between the stakes; and the heavy figures at the left of the vertical\r\nlines, the recorded measurements of depth from the datum-line to the\r\nsurface of the ground, which is indicated by the irregular line next below\r\nthe datum-line. The vertical measurements are, of course, very much\r\nexaggerated, to make the profile more marked, but they are in the proper\r\nrelation to each other.\r\n\r\nThe depth at the silt-basin is fixed at 2-1/2 feet (2.50.) The rise is\r\nrapid to stake 3, very slight from there to stake 7, very rapid from there\r\nto stake 10, a little less rapid from there to stake 11, and still less\r\nrapid from there to stake 17.\r\n\r\nTo establish the grade by the profile alone, the proper course would be to\r\nfix the depth at the stakes at which the inclination is to be changed, to\r\ndraw straight lines between the points thus found, and then to measure the\r\nvertical distance from these lines to the line indicating the surface of\r\nthe ground at the different stakes; thus, fixing the depth at stake 3, at\r\n4 feet and 13 hundredths,(15) the line drawn from that point to the depth\r\nof 2.50, at the silt-basin, will be 3 feet and 62 hundredths (3.62) below\r\nstake 1, and 3 feet and 92 hundredths (3.92) below stake 2. At stake 7 it\r\nis necessary to go sufficiently deep to pass from 7 to 10, without coming\r\ntoo near the surface at 9, which is at the foot of a steep ascent. A line\r\ndrawn straight from 4.59 feet below stake 10 to 4.17 feet at stake 17,\r\nwould be unnecessarily deep at 11, 12, 13, and 14; and, consequently it is\r\nbetter to rise to 4.19 feet at 11. So far as this part of the drain is\r\nconcerned, it would be well to continue the same rise to 12, but, in doing\r\nso, we would come too near the surface at 13, 14, and 15; or must\r\nconsiderably depress the line at 16, which would either make a bad break\r\nin the fall at that point, or carry the drain too deep at 17.\r\n\r\nBy the arrangement adopted, the grade is broken at 3, 7, 10, and 11.\r\nBetween these points, it is a straight line, with the rate of fall\r\nindicated in the following table, which commences at the upper end of the\r\ndrain and proceeds toward its outlet:\r\n\r\nFROM STAKE,   TO STAKE,   DISTANCE.

To provide against this, a silt-basin must be placed\r\nat this point which will collect the silt and prevent its entrance into\r\nthe more nearly level tile below. The construction of this silt-basin is\r\nmore particularly described in the next chapter. From stake 7 to the main\r\nsilt-basin the fall is such that the drain will clear itself.\r\n\r\nThe drawing of regular profiles, for the more important drains, will be\r\nuseful for the purpose of making the beginner familiar with the method of\r\ngrading, and with the principles on which the grade and depth are\r\ncomputed; and sometimes, in passing over very irregular surfaces, this\r\nmethod will enable even a skilled drainer to hit upon the best adjustment\r\nin less time than by computation. Ordinarily, however, the form of\r\ncomputation given in the following table, which refers to the same drain,\r\n(_C_,) will be more expeditious, and its results are mathematically more\r\ncorrect.(16)\r\n\r\n                    Fall.

Enter the lettering of the stakes in the first column,\r\n    commencing at the lower end of the drain.\r\n\r\n    2d. Enter the distances between each two stakes in the second\r\n    column, placing the measurement on the line with the number of the\r\n    _upper_ stake of the two.\r\n\r\n    3d. In the next to the last column enter, on the line with each\r\n    stake, its depth below the datum-line, as recorded in the field\r\n    book of levels, (See page 105.)\r\n\r\n    4th. On the first line of the last column, place the depth of the\r\n    lower end of the drain, (this is established by the grade of the\r\n    main or other outlet at which it discharges.)\r\n\r\n    5th. Add this depth to the first number of the line next preceding\r\n    it, and enter the sum obtained on the first line of the fifth\r\n    column, as the depth of the _drain_ below the datum-line.\r\n\r\n    6th. Having reference to the grade of the surface, (as shown by\r\n    the figures in the sixth column,) as well as to any necessity for\r\n    placing the drain at certain depths at certain places, enter the\r\n    desired depth, _in pencil,_ in the last column, opposite the\r\n    stakes marking those places. Then add together this depth and the\r\n    corresponding surface measurement in the column next preceding,\r\n    and enter the sum, _in pencil_, in the fifth column, as the depth\r\n    from the datum-line to the desired position of the drain. (In the\r\n    example in hand, these points are at Nos. 3, 7, 10, 11, and 17.)\r\n\r\n    7th. Subtract the second amount in the fifth column from the first\r\n    amount for the total fall between the two points--in the example,\r\n    \"3\" from \"Silt-Basin.\" Divide this total fall, (in feet and\r\n    hundredths,) by one hundredth of the total number of feet between\r\n    them. The result will be the rate of fall per 100 feet, and this\r\n    should be entered, in the third column, opposite each of the\r\n    intermediate distances between the points.\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n\r\n    Depth of the Drain at   20.45 feet.\r\n    the Silt-Basin\r\n    Depth of the Drain at   16.98 feet.\r\n    the Stake No. 3\r\n                            ----\r\n    Difference              3.47  feet.\r\n    Distance between the    186.-- feet.\r\n    two\r\n\r\n    1.86)3.47(1.865 or 1.87\r\n\r\n                                                                 1 86\r\n                                                                   ----\r\n                                                                1 610\r\n                                                                1 488\r\n                                                                   ----\r\n                                                                1 220\r\n                                                                1 116\r\n                                                                   ----\r\n                                                                1 040\r\n                                                                  930\r\n                                                                   ----\r\n                                                                   110\r\n\r\n    8th. Multiply the numbers of the second column by those of the\r\n    third and divide the product by 100. The result will be the amount\r\n    of fall between the stakes, (fourth column.)--Example:\r\n    1.87x82=153/100=1.53.\r\n\r\n    9th. Subtract the first number of the fourth column from the first\r\n    number of the fifth column, (on the line above it,) and place the\r\n    remainder on the next line of the fifth column.--Example:\r\n    20.70-1.64= 19.06.\r\n\r\n    Then, from this new amount, subtract the second number of the\r\n    fourth column, for the next number of the fifth, and so on, until,\r\n    in place of the entry in pencil, (Stake 3,) we place the exact\r\n    result of the computation.\r\n\r\n    Proceed in like manner with the next interval,--3 to 7.\r\n\r\n    10th. Subtract the numbers in the sixth column from those in the\r\n    fifth, and the remainders will be the depths to be entered in the\r\n    last.\r\n\r\n    Under the head of \"Remarks,\" note any peculiarity of the drain\r\n    which may require attention in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main lines _A_, _D_, and _E_, and the drain _B_, should next be graded\r\non the plan set forth for _C_, and their laterals, all of which have\r\nconsiderable fall, and being all so steep as not to require silt-basins at\r\nany point,--can, by a very simple application of the foregoing principles,\r\nbe adjusted at the proper depths. In grading the stone and tile drain,\r\n(_H, I_,) it is only necessary to adopt the depth of the last stakes of\r\nthe laterals, with which it is connected, as it is immaterial in which\r\ndirection the water flows. The ends of this drain,--from H to the head of\r\nthe drain _C10_, and from _I_ to the head of _C17_,--should, of course,\r\nhave a decided fall toward the drains.\r\n\r\nThe laterals which are placed at intervals of 20 feet, over the\r\nunderground rock on the east side of the field, should be continued at a\r\ndepth of about 3 feet for nearly their whole length, dropping in a\r\ndistance of 8 or 10 feet at their lower ends to the top of the tile of the\r\nmain. The intervals between the lower ends of _C7c_, _C7d_, and _C7e_,\r\nbeing considerably more than 20 feet, the drains may be gradually\r\ndeepened, throughout their whole length from 3 feet at the upper ends to\r\nthe depth of the top of the main at the lower ends.\r\n\r\nThe main drains _F_ and _G_, being laid in flat land, their outlets being\r\nfixed at a depth of 3.50, (the floor of the main outlet,) and it being\r\nnecessary to have them as deep as possible throughout their entire length,\r\nshould be graded with great care on the least admissible fall. This, in\r\nordinary agricultural drainage, may be fixed at .25, or 3 inches, per 100\r\nfeet. Their laterals should commence with the top of their 1/4 tile even\r\nwith the top of the 2-1/2 collar of the main,--or .15 higher than the grade\r\nof the main,--and rise, at a uniform inclination of .25, to the upper end.\r\n\r\nHaving now computed the depth at which the tile is to lie, at each stake,\r\nand entered it on the map, we are ready to mark these depths on their\r\nrespective stakes in the field, when the preliminary engineering of the\r\nwork will be completed.\r\n\r\nIt has been deemed advisable in this chapter to consider the smallest\r\ndetails of the work of the draining engineer. Those who intend to drain in\r\nthe best manner will find such details important. Those who propose to do\r\ntheir work less thoroughly, may still be guided by the principles on which\r\nthey are based. Any person who will take the pains to mature the plans of\r\nhis work as closely as has been here recommended, will as a consequence\r\ncommence his operations in the field much more understandingly. The\r\nadvantage of having everything decided beforehand,--so that the workmen\r\nneed not be delayed for want of sufficient directions, and of making, on\r\nthe map, such alterations as would have appeared necessary in the field,\r\nthus saving the cost of cutting ditches in the wrong places, will well\r\nrepay the work of the evenings of a whole winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. - HOW TO MAKE THE DRAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing, now, precisely what is to be done; having the lines all staked\r\nout, and the stakes so marked as to be clearly designated; knowing the\r\nprecise depth at which the drain is to be laid, at every point; having the\r\nrequisite tiles on the ground, and thoroughly inspected, the operator is\r\nprepared to commence actual work.\r\n\r\nHe should determine how many men he will employ, and what tools they will\r\nrequire to work to advantage. It may be best that the work be done by two\r\nor three men, or it may be advisable to employ as many as can work without\r\ninterfering with each other. In most cases,--especially where there is much\r\nwater to contend with,--the latter course will be the most economical, as\r\nthe ditches will not be so liable to be injured by the softening of their\r\nbottoms, and the caving in of their sides.\r\n\r\n*The Tools Required* are a subsoil plow, two garden lines, spades,\r\nshovels, and picks; narrow finishing spades, a finishing scoop, a tile\r\npick, a scraper for filling the ditches, a heavy wooden maul for\r\ncompacting the bottom filling, half a dozen boning-rods, a measuring rod,\r\nand a plumb rod. These should all be on hand at the outset, so that no\r\ndelay in the work may result from the want of them.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: Fig. 22 - SET OF TOOLS.]\r\n\r\n                         Fig. 22 - SET OF TOOLS.\r\n\r\n   Flat Spades of various lengths and widths, Bill-necked Scoop (_A_);\r\n     Tile-layer (_B_); Pick-axe (_C_); and Scoop Spades, and Shovel.\r\n\r\n\r\nWriters on drainage, almost without exception, recommend the use of\r\nelaborate sets of tools which are intended for cutting very narrow\r\nditches,--only wide enough at the bottom to admit the tile, and not\r\nallowing the workmen to stand in the bottom of the ditch. A set of these\r\ntools is shown in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nPossibly there may be soils in which these implements, in the hands of men\r\nskilled in their use, could be employed with economy, but they are very\r\nrare, and it is not believed to be possible, under any circumstances, to\r\nregulate the bottom of the ditch so accurately as is advisable, unless the\r\nworkman can stand directly upon it, cutting it more smoothly than he could\r\nif the point of his tool were a foot or more below the level on which he\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, Mr. J. Bailey Denton, one of the first draining engineers\r\nof Great Britain, in a letter to Judge French, says:\r\n\r\n\"As to tools, it is the same with them as it is with the art of draining\r\nitself,--too much rule and too much drawing upon paper; all very right to\r\nbegin with, but very prejudicial to progress. I employ, as engineer to the\r\nGeneral Land Drainage Company, and on my private account, during the\r\ndrainage season, as many as 2,000 men, and it is an actual fact, that not\r\none of them uses the set of tools figured in print. I have frequently\r\npurchased a number of sets of the Birmingham tools, and sent them down on\r\nextensive works. The laborers would purchase a few of the smaller tools,\r\nsuch as Nos. 290, 291, and 301, figured in Morton's excellent Cyclopaedia\r\nof Agriculture, and would try them, and then order others of the country\r\nblacksmith, differing in several respects; less weighty and much less\r\ncostly, and moreover, much better as working tools. All I require of the\r\ncutters, is, that the bottom of the drain should be evenly cut, to fit the\r\nsize of the pipe. The rest of the work takes care of itself; for a good\r\nworkman will economize his labor for his own sake, by moving as little\r\nearth as practicable; thus, for instance, a first-class cutter, in clays,\r\nwill get down 4 feet with a 12-inch opening, _ordinarily_; if he wishes to\r\n_show off_, he will sacrifice his own comfort to appearance, and will do\r\nit with a 10-inch opening.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Central Park work, sets of these tools were procured, at\r\nconsiderable expense, and every effort was made to compel the men to use\r\nthem, but it was soon found that, even in the easiest digging, there was a\r\nreal economy in using, for the first 3 feet of the ditch, the common\r\nspade, pick, and shovel,--finishing the bottoms with the narrow spade and\r\nscoop hereafter described, and it is probable that the experience of that\r\nwork will be sustained by that of the country at large.\r\n\r\n*Marking the Lines.*--To lay a drain directly under the position of its\r\nstakes, would require that enough earth be left at each point to hold the\r\nstake, and that the ditch be tunneled under it. This is expensive and\r\nunnecessary. It is better to dig the ditches at one side of the lines of\r\nstakes, far enough away for the earth to hold them firmly in their places,\r\nbut near enough to allow measurements to be taken from the grade pegs. If\r\nthe ditch be placed always to the right, or always to the left, of the\r\nline, and at a uniform distance, the general plan will remain the same,\r\nand the lines will be near enough to those marked on the map to be easily\r\nfound at any future time. In fact, if it be known that the line of tiles\r\nis two feet to the right of the position indicated, it will only be\r\nnecessary, at any time, should it be desired to open an old drain, to\r\nmeasure two feet to the right of the surveyed position to strike the line\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nIn soils of ordinary tenacity, ditches 4 feet deep need not be more than\r\ntwenty (20) inches wide at the surface, and four (4) inches wide at the\r\nbottom. This will allow, in each side, a slope of eight (8) inches, which\r\nis sufficient except in very loose soils, and even these may be braced up,\r\nif inclined to cave in. There are cases where the soil contains so much\r\nrunning sand, and is so saturated with water, that no precautions will\r\navail to keep up the banks. Ditches in such ground will sometimes fall in,\r\nuntil the excavation reaches a width of 8 or 10 feet. Such instances,\r\nhowever, are very rare, and must be treated as the occasion suggests.\r\n\r\nOne of the garden lines should be set at a distance of about 6 inches from\r\nthe row of stakes, and the other at a further distance of 20 inches. If\r\nthe land is in grass, the position of these lines may be marked with a\r\nspade, and they may be removed at once; but, if it is arable land, it will\r\nbe best to leave the lines in position until the ditch is excavated to a\r\nsufficient depth to mark it clearly. Indeed, it will be well to at once\r\nremove all of the sod and surface soil, say to a depth of 6 inches,\r\n(throwing this on the same side with the stakes, and back of them.) The\r\nwhole force can be profitably employed in this work, until all of the\r\nditches to be dug are scored to this depth over the entire tract to be\r\ndrained, except in swamps which are still too wet for this work.\r\n\r\n*Water Courses.*--The brooks which carry the water from the springs should\r\nbe \"jumped\" in marking out the lines, as it is desirable that their water\r\nbe kept in separate channels, so far as possible, until the tiles are\r\nready to receive it, as, if allowed to run in the open ditches, it would\r\nundermine the banks and keep the bottom too soft for sound work.\r\n\r\nWith this object, commence at the southern boundary of our example tract,\r\n10 or 15 feet east of the point of outlet, and drive a straight,\r\ntemporary, shallow ditch to a point a little west of the intersection of\r\nthe main line _D_ with its first lateral; then carry it in a northwesterly\r\ndirection, crossing _C_ midway between the silt-basin and stake _C 1_, and\r\nthence into the present line of the brook, turning all of the water into\r\nthe ditch. A branch of this ditch may be run up between the lines _F_ and\r\n_G_ to receive the water from the spring which lies in that direction.\r\nThis arrangement will keep the water out of the way until the drains are\r\nready to take it.\r\n\r\n*The Outlet.*--The water being all discharged through the new temporary\r\nditch, the old brook, beyond the boundary, should be cleared out to the\r\nfinal level (3.75,) and an excavation made, just within the boundary,\r\nsufficient to receive the masonry which is to protect the outlet. A good\r\nform of outlet is shown in Fig. 23. It may be cheaply made by any farmer,\r\nespecially if he have good stone at hand;--if not, brick may be used, laid\r\non a solid foundation of stout planks, which, (being protected from the\r\nair and always saturated with water,) will last a very long time.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 23 - OUTLET, SECURED WITH MASONRY AND GRATING.]\r\n\r\n           Fig. 23 - OUTLET, SECURED WITH MASONRY AND GRATING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf made of stone, a solid floor, at least 2 feet square, should be placed\r\nat, or below, the level of the brook. If this consist of a single stone,\r\nit will be better than if of several smaller pieces. On this, place\r\nanother layer extending the whole width of the first, but reaching only\r\nfrom its inner edge to its center line, so as to leave a foot in width of\r\nthe bottom stone to receive the fall of the water. This second layer\r\nshould reach exactly the grade of the outlet (3.50) or a height of 3\r\ninches from the brook level. On the floor thus made, there should be laid\r\nthe tiles which are to constitute the outlets of the several drains;\r\n_i.e._, one 3-1/2-inch tile for the line from the silt-basin, two\r\n1-1/4-inch for the lines _F_ and _G_, and one 2-1/4-inch for the main line\r\n_E_. These tiles should lie close to each other and be firmly cemented\r\ntogether, so that no water can pass outside of them, and a rubble-work of\r\nstone may with advantage be carried up a foot above them. Stone work,\r\nwhich may be rough and uncemented, but should always be solid, may then be\r\nbuilt up at the sides, and covered with a secure coping of stone. A floor\r\nand sloping sides of stone work, jointed with the previously described\r\nwork, and well cemented, or laid in strong clay or mortar, may, with\r\nbenefit, be carried a few feet beyond the outlet. This will effectually\r\nprevent the undermining of the structure. After the entire drainage of the\r\nfield is finished, the earth above these sloping sides, and that back of\r\nthe coping, should be neatly sloped, and protected by sods. An iron\r\ngrating, fine enough to prevent the entrance of vermin, placed in front of\r\nthe tile, at a little distance from them,--and secured by a flat stone set\r\non edge and hollowed out, so as merely to allow the water to flow freely\r\nfrom the drains,--the stone being cemented in its place so as to allow no\r\nwater to pass under it,--will give a substantial and permanent finish to\r\nthe structure.\r\n\r\nAn outlet finished in this way, at an extra cost of a few dollars, will be\r\nmost satisfactory, as a lasting means of securing the weakest and most\r\nimportant part of the system of drains. When no precaution of this sort is\r\ntaken, the water frequently forces a passage under the tile for some\r\ndistance up the drains, undermining and displacing them, and so softening\r\nthe bottom that it will be difficult, in making repairs, to secure a solid\r\nfoundation for the work. Usually, repairs of this sort, aside from the\r\nannoyance attending them, will cost more than the amount required to make\r\nthe permanent outlet described above. As well constructed outlets are\r\nnecessarily rather expensive, as much of the land as possible should be\r\ndrained to each one that it is necessary to make, by laying main lines\r\nwhich will collect all of the water which can be brought to it.\r\n\r\n*The Main Silt-Basin.*--The silt-basin, at which the drains are collected,\r\nmay best be built before any drains are brought to it, and the work may\r\nproceed simultaneously with that at the outlet. It should be so placed\r\nthat its center will lie exactly under the stake which marks its position,\r\nbecause it will constitute one of the leading landmarks for the survey of\r\nthe drains.(17)\r\n\r\nBefore removing the stake and grade stake, mark their position by four\r\nstakes, set at a distance from it of 4 or 5 feet, in such positions that\r\ntwo lines, drawn from those which are opposite to each other, will\r\nintersect at the point indicated; and place near one of them a grade\r\nstake, driven to the exact level of the one to be removed. This being\r\ndone, dig a well, 4 feet in diameter, to a depth of 2-1/2 feet below the\r\ngrade of the outlet drain, (in the example under consideration this would\r\nbe 5 feet below the grade stake.) If much water collects in the hole,\r\nwiden it, in the direction of the outlet drain, sufficiently to give room\r\nfor baling out the water. Now build, in this well, a structure 2 feet in\r\ninterior diameter, such as is shown in Fig. 24, having its bottom 2 feet,\r\nin the clear, below the grade of the outlet, and carry its wall a little\r\nhigher than the general surface of the ground. At the proper height\r\ninsert, in the brick work, the necessary for tiles all incoming and\r\noutgoing drains; in this case, a 3-1/2-inch tile for the outlet,\r\n2-1/4-inch for the mains _A_ and _C_, and 1-1/4-inch for _B_ and _D_.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Fig. 24 - SILT-BASIN, BUILT TO THE SURFACE.]\r\n\r\n               Fig. 24 - SILT-BASIN, BUILT TO THE SURFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis basin being finished and covered with a flat stone or other suitable\r\nmaterial, connect it with the outlet by an open ditch, unless the bottom\r\nof the ditch, when laid open to the proper depth, be found to be of muck\r\nor quicksand. In such case, it will be best to lay the tile at once, and\r\ncover it in for the whole distance, as, on a soft bottom, it would be\r\ndifficult to lay it well when the full drainage of the field is flowing\r\nthrough the ditch. The tiles should be laid with all care, on a perfectly\r\nregulated fall,--using strips of board under them if the bottom is shaky or\r\nsoft,--as on this line depends the success of all the drains above it,\r\nwhich might be rendered useless by a single badly laid tile at this point,\r\nor by any other cause of obstruction to the flow.\r\n\r\nWhile the work is progressing in the field above, there will be a great\r\ndeal of muddy water and some sticks, grass, and other rubbish, running\r\nfrom the ditches above the basin, and care must be taken to prevent this\r\ndrain from becoming choked. A piece of wire cloth, or basket work, placed\r\nover the outlet in the basin, will keep out the coarser matters, and the\r\nmud which would accumulate in the tile may be removed by occasional\r\nflushing. This is done by crowding a tuft of grass,--or a bit of sod,--into\r\nthe lower end of the tile (at the outlet,) securing it there until the\r\nwater rises in the basin, and then removing it. The rush of water will be\r\nsufficient to wash the tile clean.\r\n\r\nThis plan is not without objections, and, as a rule, it is never well to\r\nlay any tiles at the lower end of a drain until all above it is finished;\r\nbut when a considerable outlet must be secured through soft land, which is\r\ninclined to cave in, and to get soft at the bottom, it will save labor to\r\nsecure the tile in place before much water reaches it, even though it\r\nrequire a daily flushing to keep it clean.\r\n\r\n*Opening the Ditches.*--Thus far it has been sought to secure a permanent\r\noutlet, and to connect it by a secure channel, with the silt-basin, which\r\nis to collect the water of the different series of drains. The next step\r\nis to lay open the ditches for these. It will be best to commence with the\r\nmain line _A_ and its laterals, as they will take most of the water which\r\nnow flows through the open brook, and prevent its interference with the\r\nrest of the work.\r\n\r\nThe first work is the opening of the ditches to a depth of about 3 feet,\r\nwhich may be best done with the common spade, pick, and shovel, except\r\nthat in ground which is tolerably free from stones, a subsoil plow will\r\noften take the place of the pick, with much saving of labor. It _may_ be\r\ndrawn by oxen working in a long yoke, which will allow them to walk one on\r\neach side of the ditch, but this is dangerous, as they are liable to\r\ndisturb the stakes, (especially the grade stakes,) and to break down the\r\nedges of the ditches. The best plan is to use a small subsoil plow, drawn\r\nby a single horse, or strong mule, trained to walk in the ditch. The beast\r\nwill soon learn to accommodate himself to his narrow quarters, and will\r\nwork easily in a ditch 2-1/2 feet deep, having a width of less than afoot\r\nat the bottom; of course there must be a way provided for him to come out\r\nat each end. Deeper than this there is no economy in using horse power,\r\nand even for this depth it will be necessary to use a plow having only one\r\nstilt.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: Fig. 25 - FINISHING SPADE.]\r\n\r\n                      Fig. 25 - FINISHING SPADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the main line is cut into the open brook, this should be furnished\r\nwith a wooden trough, which will carry the water across it, so that the\r\nditch shall receive only the filtration from the ground. Those laterals\r\nwest of the main line, which are crossed by the brook, had better not be\r\nopened at present,--not until the water of the spring is admitted to and\r\nremoved by the drain.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Fig. 26 - FINISHING SCOOP.]\r\n\r\n                          Fig. 26 - FINISHING SCOOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other laterals and the whole of the main line, having been cut to a\r\ndepth of 3 feet, take a finishing spade, (Fig. 25,) which is only 4 inches\r\nwide at its point, and dig to within 2 or 3 inches of the depth marked on\r\nthe stakes, making the bottom tolerably smooth, with the aid of the\r\nfinishing scoop, (Fig. 26,) and giving it as regular an inclination as can\r\nbe obtained by the eye alone.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: Fig. 27 - BRACING THE SIDES IN SOFT LAND.]\r\n\r\n              Fig. 27 - BRACING THE SIDES IN SOFT LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the ground is \"rotten,\" and the banks of the ditches incline to cave\r\nin, as is often the case in passing wet places, the earth which is thrown\r\nout in digging must be thrown back sufficiently far from the edge to\r\nprevent its weight from increasing the tendency; and the sides of the\r\nditch may be supported by bits of board braced apart as is shown in Fig.\r\n27.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: Fig. 28 - MEASURING STAFF.]\r\n\r\n                      Fig. 28 - MEASURING STAFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner of opening the ditches, which is described above, for the main\r\n_A_ and its laterals, will apply to the drains of the whole field and to\r\nall similar work.\r\n\r\n*Grading the Bottoms.*--The next step in the work is to grade the bottoms\r\nof the ditches, so as to afford a bed for the tiles on the exact lines\r\nwhich are indicated by the figures marked on the different stakes.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which this is to be done may be illustrated by describing\r\nthe work required for the line from *C10* to *C17*, (Fig. 20,) after it\r\nhas been opened, as described above, to within 2 or 3 inches of the final\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nA measuring rod, or square, such as is shown in Fig. 28,(18) is set at\r\n*C10*, so that the lower side of its arm is at the mark 4.59 on the staff,\r\n(or at a little less than 4.6 if it is divided only into feet and tenths,)\r\nand is held upright in the ditch, with its arm directly over the grade\r\nstake. The earth below it is removed, little by little, until it will\r\ntouch the top of the stake and the bottom of the ditch at the same time.\r\nIf the ground is soft, it should be cut out until a flat stone, a block of\r\nwood, or a piece of tile, or of brick, sunk in the bottom, will have its\r\nsurface at the exact point of measurement. This point is the bottom of the\r\nditch on which the collar of the tile is to lie at that stake. In the same\r\nmanner the depth is fixed at _C11_ (4.19,) and _C12_ (4.41,) as the rate\r\nof fall changes at each of these points, and at _C15_ (3.89,) and _C17_\r\n(4.17,) because (although the fall is uniform from _C12_ to _C17_,) the\r\ndistance is too great for accurate sighting.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: Fig. 29 - BONING ROD.]\r\n\r\n                            Fig. 29 - BONING ROD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving provided _boning-rods_, which are strips of board 7 feet long,\r\nhaving horizontal cross pieces at their upper ends, (see Fig. 29,) set\r\nthese perpendicularly on the spots which have been found by measurement to\r\nbe at the correct depth opposite stakes 10, 11, 12, 15, and 17, and fasten\r\neach in its place by wedging it between two strips of board laid across\r\nthe ditch, so as to clasp it, securing these in their places by laying\r\nstones or earth upon their ends.\r\n\r\nAs these boning-rods are all exactly 7 feet long, of course, a line\r\nsighted across their tops will be exactly 7 feet higher, at all points,\r\nthan the required grade of the ditch directly beneath it, and if a plumb\r\nrod, (similar to the boning-rod, but provided with a line and plummet,) be\r\nset perpendicularly on any point of the bottom of the drain, the relation\r\nof its cross piece to the line of sight across the tops of the boning-rods\r\nwill show whether the bottom of the ditch at that point is too high, or\r\ntoo low, or just right. The manner of sighting over two boning-rods and an\r\nintermediate plumb-rod, is shown in Fig. 31.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30 - POSITION OF WORKMAN AND USE OF FINISHING SCOOP.]\r\n\r\n        Fig. 30 - POSITION OF WORKMAN AND USE OF FINISHING SCOOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree persons are required to finish the bottom of the ditch; one to sight\r\nacross the tops of the boning-rods, one to hold the plumb-rod at different\r\npoints as the finishing progresses, and one in the ditch, (see Fig. 30,)\r\nprovided with the finishing spade and scoop,--and, in hard ground, with a\r\npick,--to cut down or fill up as the first man calls \"too high,\" or, \"too\r\nlow.\" An inch or two of filling maybe beaten sufficiently hard with the\r\nback of the scoop, but if several inches should be required, it should be\r\nwell rammed with the top of a pick, or other suitable instrument, as any\r\nsubsequent settling would disarrange the fall.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Fig. 31 - SIGHTING BY THE BONING-RODS.]\r\n\r\n                  Fig. 31 - SIGHTING BY THE BONING-RODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the lateral drains are to be laid first, they should be the first\r\ngraded, and as they are arranged to discharge into the tops of the mains,\r\ntheir water will still flow off, although the main ditches are not yet\r\nreduced to their final depth. After the laterals are laid and filled in,\r\nthe main should be graded, commencing at the upper end; the tiles being\r\nlaid and covered as fast as the bottom is made ready, so that it may not\r\nbe disturbed by the water of which the main carries so much more than the\r\nlaterals.\r\n\r\n*Tile-Laying.*--Gisborne says: \"It would be scarcely more absurd to set a\r\ncommon blacksmith to eye needles than to employ a common laborer to lay\r\npipes and collars.\" The work comes under the head of _skilled labor,_ and,\r\nwhile no very great exercise of judgment is required in its performance,\r\nthe little that is required is imperatively necessary, and the details of\r\nthe work should be deftly done. The whole previous outlay,--the survey and\r\nstaking of the field, the purchase of the tiles, the digging and grading\r\nof the ditches--has been undertaken that we may make the conduit of\r\nearthenware pipes which is now to be laid, and the whole may be rendered\r\nuseless by a want of care and completeness in the performance of this\r\nchief operation. This subject, (in connection with that of finishing the\r\nbottoms of the ditches,) is very clearly treated in Mr. Hoskyns' charming\r\nessay,(19) as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It was urged by Mr. Brunel, as a justification for more attention and\r\nexpense in the laying of the rails of the Great Western, than had been\r\never thought of upon previously constructed lines, that all the\r\nembankments and cuttings, and earthworks and stations, and law and\r\nparliamentary expenses--in fact, the whole of the outlay encountered in the\r\nformation of a railway, had for its main and ultimate object _a perfectly\r\nsmooth and level line of rail_; that to turn stingy at this point, just\r\nwhen you had arrived at the great ultimatum of the whole proceedings, viz:\r\nthe iron wheel-track, was a sort of saving which evinced a want of true\r\npreception of the great object of all the labor that had preceded it. It\r\nmay seem curious to our experiences, in these days, that such a doctrine\r\ncould ever have needed to be enforced by argument; yet no one will deem it\r\nwonderful who has personally witnessed the unaccountable and ever new\r\ndifficulty of getting proper attention paid to the leveling of the bottom\r\nof a drain, and the laying of the tiles in that continuous line, where one\r\nsingle depression or irregularity, by collecting the water at that spot,\r\nyear after year, tends toward the eventual stoppage of the whole drain,\r\nthrough two distinct causes, the softening of the foundation underneath\r\nthe sole, or tile flange, and the deposit of soil inside the tile from the\r\nwater collected at the spot, and standing there after the rest had run\r\noff. Every depression, however slight, is constantly doing this mischief\r\nin every drain where the fall is but trifling; and if to the two\r\nconsequences above mentioned, we may add the decomposition of the tile\r\nitself by the action of water long stagnant within it, we may deduce that\r\nevery tile-drain laid with these imperfections in the finishing of the\r\nbottom, has a tendency toward obliteration, out of all reasonable\r\nproportion with that of a well-burnt tile laid on a perfectly even\r\ninclination, which, humanly speaking, may be called a permanent thing. An\r\nopen ditch cut by the most skillful workman, in the summer, affords the\r\nbest illustration of this underground mischief. Nothing can look smoother\r\nand more even than the bottom, until that uncompromising test of accurate\r\nlevels, the water, makes its appearance: all on a sudden the whole scene\r\nis changed, the eye-accredited level vanishes as if some earthquake had\r\ntaken place: here, there is a gravelly _scour_, along which the stream\r\nrushes in a thousand little angry-looking ripples; there, it hangs and\r\nlooks as dull and heavy as if it had given up running at all, as a useless\r\nwaste of energy; in another place, a few dead leaves or sticks, or a\r\nmorsel of soil broken from the side, dams back the water for a\r\nconsiderable distance, occasioning a deposit of soil along the whole\r\nreach, greater in proportion to the quantity and the muddiness of the\r\nwater detained. All this shows the paramount importance of perfect\r\nevenness in the bed on which the tiles are laid. _The worst laid tile is\r\nthe measure of the goodness and permanence of the whole drain_, just as\r\nthe weakest link of a chain is the measure of its strength.\"\r\n\r\nThe simple laying of the smaller sizes of pipes and collars in the lateral\r\ndrains, is an easy matter. It requires care and precision in placing the\r\ncollar equally under the end of each pipe, (having the joint at the middle\r\nof the collar,) in having the ends of the pipes actually touch each other\r\nwithin the collars, and in brushing away any loose dirt which may have\r\nfallen on the spot on which the collar is to rest. The connection of the\r\nlaterals with the mains, the laying of the larger sizes of tiles so as to\r\nform a close joint, the wedging of these larger tiles firmly into their\r\nplaces, and the trimming which is necessary in going around sharp curves,\r\nand in putting in the shorter pieces which are needed to fill out the\r\nexact length of the drain, demand more skill and judgment than are often\r\nfound in the common ditcher. Still, any clever workman, who has a careful\r\nhabit, may easily be taught all that is necessary; and until he is\r\nthoroughly taught,--and not only knows how to do the work well, but, also,\r\nunderstands the importance of doing it well,--the proprietor should\r\ncarefully watch the laying of every piece.\r\n\r\n_Never have tiles laid by the rod, but always by the day._ \"The more\r\nhaste, the less speed,\" is a maxim which applies especially to\r\ntile-laying.\r\n\r\nIf the proprietor or the engineer does not overlook the laying of each\r\ntile as it is done, and probably he will not, he should carefully inspect\r\nevery piece before it is covered. It is well to walk along the ditches and\r\ntouch each tile with the end of a light rod, in such a way as to see\r\nwhether it is firm enough in its position not to be displaced by the earth\r\nwhich will fall upon it in filling the ditches.\r\n\r\nPreparatory to laying, the tiles should be placed along one side of the\r\nditch, near enough to be easily reached by a man standing in it. When\r\ncollars are to be used, one of these should be slipped over one end of\r\neach tile. The workman stands in the ditch, with his face toward its upper\r\nend. The first tile is laid with a collar on its lower end, and the collar\r\nis drawn one-half of its length forward, so as to receive the end of the\r\nnext tile. The upper end of the first tile is closed with a stone, or a\r\nbit of broken tile placed firmly against it. The next tile has its nose\r\nplaced into the projecting half of the collar of the first one, and its\r\nown collar is drawn forward to receive the end of the third, and thus to\r\nthe end of the drain, the workman walking backward as the work progresses.\r\nBy and by, when he comes to connect the lateral with the main, he may find\r\nthat a short piece of tile is needed to complete the length; this should\r\nnot be placed next to the tile of the main, where it is raised above the\r\nbottom of the ditch, but two or three lengths back, leaving the connection\r\nwith the main to be made with a tile of full length. If the piece to be\r\ninserted is only two or three inches long, it may be omitted, and the\r\nspace covered by using a whole 21/2-inch tile in place of the collar. In\r\nturning corners or sharp curves, the end of the tile may be chipped off,\r\nso as to be a little thinner on one side, which will allow it to be turned\r\nat a greater angle in the collar.\r\n\r\nIf the drain turns a right angle, it will be better to dig out the bottom\r\nof the ditch to a depth of about eight inches, and to set a 6-inch tile on\r\nend in the hole, perforating its sides, so as to admit the ends of the\r\npipes at the proper level. This 6-inch tile, (which acts as a small\r\nsilt-basin,) should stand on a board or on a flat stone, and its top\r\nshould be covered with a stone or with a couple of bricks. Wood will last\r\nalmost forever below the level of the drain, where it will always be\r\nsaturated with water, but in the drier earth above the tile, it is much\r\nmore liable to decay.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 32 - PICK FOR DRESSING AND PREFORATING TILE.]\r\n\r\n          Fig. 32 - PICK FOR DRESSING AND PREFORATING TILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trimming and perforating of the tile is done with a \"tile-pick,\" (Fig.\r\n32,) the hatchet end, tolerably sharp, being used for the trimming, and\r\nthe point, for making the holes. This is done by striking lightly around\r\nthe circumference of the hole until the center piece falls in, or can be\r\neasily knocked in. If the hole is irregular, and does not fit the tile\r\nnicely, the open space should be covered with bits of broken tile, to keep\r\nthe earth out.\r\n\r\nAs fast as the laterals are laid and inspected, they should be filled in\r\nto the depth of at least a foot, to protect the tiles from being broken by\r\nthe falling of stones or lumps of earth from the top, and from being\r\ndisplaced by water flowing in the ditch. Two or three feet of the lower\r\nend may be left uncovered until the connection with the main is finished.\r\n\r\nIn the main drains, when the tiles are of the size with which collars are\r\nused, the laying is done in the same manner. If it is necessary to use\r\n3-1/2-inch tiles, or any larger size, much more care must be given to the\r\nclosing of the joints. All tiles, in manufacture, dry more rapidly at the\r\ntop, which is more exposed to the air, than at the bottom, and they are,\r\ntherefore, contracted and made shorter at the top. This difference is most\r\napparent in the larger sizes. The large _round_ tiles, which can be laid\r\non any side, can easily be made to form a close joint, and they should be\r\nsecured in their proper position by stones or lumps of earth, wedged in\r\nbetween them and the sides of the ditch. The sole tiles must lie with the\r\nshortest sides up, and, usually, the space between two tiles, at the top,\r\nwill be from one-quarter to one-half of an inch. To remedy this defect,\r\nand form a joint which may he protected against the entrance of earth, the\r\nbottom should he trimmed off, so as to allow the tops to come closer\r\ntogether. Any opening, of less than a quarter of an inch, can he\r\nsatisfactorily covered,--more than that should not be allowed. In turning\r\ncorners, or in passing around curves, with large tiles, their ends must he\r\nbeveled off with the pick, so as to fit nicely in this position.\r\n\r\nThe best covering for the joints of tiles which are laid without collars,\r\nis a scrap of tin, bent so as to fit their shape,--scraps of leather, or\r\nbits of strong wood shavings, answer a very good purpose, though both of\r\nthese latter require to be held in place by putting a little earth over\r\ntheir ends as soon as laid on the tile. _Very small_ grass ropes drawn\r\nover the joints, (the ends being held down with stones or earth,) form a\r\nsatisfactory covering, but care should be taken that they be not too\r\nthick. A small handful of wood shavings, thrown over the joints, also\r\nanswers a good purpose. Care, however, should always be taken, in using\r\nany material which will decay readily, to have no more than is necessary\r\nto keep the earth out, lest, in its decay, it furnish material to be\r\ncarried into the tile and obstruct the flow. This precaution becomes less\r\nnecessary in the case of drains which always carry considerable streams of\r\nwater, but if they are at times sluggish in their flow, too much care\r\ncannot be given to keep them free of all possible causes of obstruction.\r\nAs nothing is gained by increasing the quantity of loose covering beyond\r\nwhat is needed to close the joints, and as such covering is only procured\r\nwith some trouble, there is no reason for its extravagant use.\r\n\r\nThere seems to remain in the minds of many writers on drainage a\r\nglimmering of the old fallacy that underdrains, like open drains, receive\r\ntheir water from above, and it is too commonly recommended that porous\r\nsubstances be placed above the tile. If, as is universally conceded, the\r\nwater rises into the tile from below, this is unnecessary. The practice of\r\ncovering the joints, and even covering the whole tile, (often to the depth\r\nof a foot,) with tan-bark, turf, coarse gravel, etc., is in no wise to be\r\ncommended; and, while the objections to it are not necessarily very grave\r\nin all cases, it always introduces an element of insecurity, and it is a\r\nwaste of money, if nothing worse.\r\n\r\nThe tile layer need not concern himself with the question, of affording\r\nentrance room for the water. Let him, so far as the rude materials at hand\r\nwill allow, make the joints perfectly tight, and when the water comes, it\r\nwill find ample flaws in his work, and he will have been a good workman if\r\nit do not find room to flow in a current, carrying particles of dirt with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn ditches in which water is running at the time of laying the tiles, the\r\nprocess should follow closely after the grading, and the stream may even\r\nbe dammed back, section after section, (a plugged tile being placed under\r\nthe dam, to be afterwards replaced by a free one,) and graded, laid and\r\ncovered before the water breaks in. There is one satisfaction in this kind\r\nof work,--that, while it is difficult to lay the drain so thoroughly well\r\nas in a dry ditch, the amount of water is sufficient to overcome any\r\nslight tendency to obstruction.\r\n\r\n*Connections.*--As has been before stated, lateral drains should always\r\nenter at the top of the main. Even in the most shallow work, the slightly\r\ndecreased depth of the lateral, which this arrangement requires, is well\r\ncompensated for by the free outlet which it secures.\r\n\r\nAfter the tile of the main, which is to receive a side drain, has been\r\nfitted to its place, and the point of junction marked, it should be taken\r\nup and perforated; then the end of the tile of the lateral should be so\r\ntrimmed as to fit the hole as accurately as may be, the large tile\r\nreplaced in its position, and the small one laid on it,--reaching over to\r\nthe floor of the lateral ditch. Then connect it with the lateral as\r\npreviously laid, fill up solidly the space under the tile which reaches\r\nover to the top of the main, (so that it cannot become disturbed in\r\nfilling,) and lay bits of tile, or other suitable covering, around the\r\nconnecting joint.(20)\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Fig. 33 - LATERAL DRAIN ENTERING AT TOP.]\r\n\r\n                   Fig. 33 - LATERAL DRAIN ENTERING AT TOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the main drain is laid with collars, it should be so arranged that,\r\nby substituting a full tile in the place of the collar,--leaving, within\r\nit, a space between the smaller pipes,--a connection can be made with this\r\nlarger tile, as is represented in Figures 33 and 34.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Fig. 34 - SECTIONAL VIEW OF JOINT.]\r\n\r\n                  Fig. 34 - SECTIONAL VIEW OF JOINT.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Silt-Basins* should be used at all points where a drain, after running\r\nfor any considerable distance at a certain rate of fall, changes to a less\r\nrapid fall,--unless, indeed, the diminished fall be still sufficiently\r\ngreat for the removal of silty matters, (say two feet or more in a\r\nhundred). They may be made in any manner which will secure a stoppage of\r\nthe direct current, and afford room below the floor of the tile for the\r\ndeposit of the silt which the water has carried in suspension; and they\r\nmay be of any suitable material;--even a sound flour barrel will serve a\r\npretty good purpose for many years. The most complete form of basin is\r\nthat represented in Figure 24.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: Fig. 35 - SQUARE BRICK SILT-BASIN.]\r\n\r\n                      Fig. 35 - SQUARE BRICK SILT-BASIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the object is only to afford room for the collection of the silt of a\r\nconsiderable length of drain, and it is not thought worth while to keep\r\nopen a communication with the surface, for purposes of inspection, a\r\nsquare box of brick work, (Fig. 35,) having a depth of one and a half or\r\ntwo feet below the floor of the drain,--tiles for the drains being built in\r\nthe walls, and the top covered with a broad stone,--will answer very well.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Fig. 36 - SILT-BASIN OF VITRIFIED PIPE.]\r\n\r\n                   Fig. 36 - SILT-BASIN OF VITRIFIED PIPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good sort of basin, to reach to the surface of the ground, may be made\r\nof large, vitrified drain pipes,--such as are used for town\r\nsewerage,--having a diameter of from six to twelve inches, according to the\r\nrequirements of the work. This basin is shown in Figure 36.\r\n\r\nFigure 37 represents a basin made of a 6-inch tile,--similar to that\r\ndescribed on page 130, for turning a short corner. A larger basin of the\r\nsame size, cheaper than if built of brick, may be made by using a large\r\nvitrified drain pipe in the place of the one shown in the cut. These\r\nvitrified pipes may be perforated in the manner described for the common\r\ntile.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: Fig. 37 - TILE SILT-BASIN.]\r\n\r\n                      Fig. 37 - TILE SILT-BASIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn laying the main line _C_, (Fig. 21,) an underground basin of brick\r\nwork, (Fig. 35,) or its equivalent, should be placed at stake 7, because\r\nat that point the water, which has been flowing on an inclination of 1.09,\r\n2.00 and 2.83 per 100, continues its course over the much less fall of\r\nonly 0.56 per 100.\r\n\r\nIf, among the tiles which have passed the inspection, there are some\r\nwhich, from over burning, are smaller than the average, they should be\r\nlaid at the upper ends of the laterals. The cardinal rule of the tile\r\nlayer should be _never to have a single tile in the finished drain of\r\nsmaller size, of more irregular shape, or less perfectly laid, than any\r\ntile above it_. If there is to be any difference in the quality of the\r\ndrain, at different points, let it grow better as it approaches the outlet\r\nand has a greater length above depending upon its action.\r\n\r\n*Covering the Tiles, and Filling-in the Ditches.*--The best material for\r\ncovering the tiles is that which will the most completely surround them,\r\nso as to hold them in their places; will be the least likely to have\r\npassages for the flow of _streams_ of water into the joints, and will\r\nafford the least silt to obstruct the drain. Clay is the best of all\r\navailable materials, because it is of the most uniform character\r\nthroughout its mass, and may be most perfectly compacted around the tiles.\r\nAs has been before stated, all matters which are subject to decay are\r\nobjectionable, because they will furnish fine matters to enter the joints,\r\nand by their decrease of bulk, may leave openings in the earth through\r\nwhich streams of muddy water may find their way into the tiles. Gravel is\r\nbad, and will remain bad until its spaces are filled with fine dirt\r\ndeposited by water, which, leaving only a part of its impurities here,\r\ncarries the rest into the drain. A gravelly loam, free from roots or other\r\norganic matter, if it is strong enough to be worked into a ball when wet,\r\nwill answer a very good purpose.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the earth which was thrown out from the bottom of the ditch,\r\nand which now lies at the top of the dirt heap, is the best to be returned\r\nabout the tiles, being first freed from any stones it may contain which\r\nare large enough to break or disturb the tiles in falling on to them.\r\n\r\nIf the bottom of the ditch consists of quicksand or other silty matters,\r\nclay or some other suitable earth should be sought in that which was\r\nexcavated from a less depth, or should be brought from another place. A\r\nthin layer of this having been placed in the bottom of the ditch when\r\ngrading, a slight covering of the same about the tiles will so encase them\r\nas to prevent the entrance of the more \"slippy\" soil.\r\n\r\nThe first covering of fine earth, free from stones and clods, should be\r\nsprinkled gently over the tiles, no full shovelfuls being thrown on to\r\nthem until they are covered at least six inches deep. When the filling has\r\nreached a height of from fifteen to twenty inches, the men may jump into\r\nthe ditch and tramp it down evenly and regularly, not treading too hard in\r\nany one place at first. When thus lightly compacted about the tile, so\r\nthat any further pressure cannot displace them, the filling should be\r\nrepeatedly rammed, (the more the better,) by two men standing astride the\r\nditch, facing each other, and working a maul, such as is shown in Figure\r\n38, and which may weigh from 80 to 100 pounds.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: Fig. 38 - MAUL FOR RAMMING.]\r\n\r\n                     Fig. 38 - MAUL FOR RAMMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose to whom this recommendation is new, will, doubtless, think it\r\nunwise. The only reply to their objection must be that others who shared\r\ntheir opinion, have, by long observation and experience, been convinced of\r\nits correctness. They may practically convince themselves of the value of\r\nthis sort of covering by a simple and inexpensive experiment: Take two\r\nlarge, water-tight hogsheads, bore through the side of each, a few inches\r\nfrom the bottom, a hole just large enough to admit a 1-1/4-inch tile;\r\ncover the bottom to the hight of the lower edge of the hole with strong,\r\nwet clay, beaten to a hard paste; on this, lay a line of pipes and\r\ncollars,--the inner end sealed with putty, and the tile which passes\r\nthrough the hole so wedged about with putty, that no water could pass out\r\nbetween it and the outside of the hole. Cover the tile in one hogshead\r\nwith loose gravel, and then fill it to the top with loose earth. Cover the\r\ntile in the other, twenty inches deep, with ordinary stiff clay, (not wet\r\nenough to _puddle_, but sufficiently moist to pack well,) and ram it\r\nthoroughly, so as to make sure that the tiles are completely clasped, and\r\nthat there is no crack nor crevice through which water can trickle, and\r\nthen fill this hogshead to the top with earth, of the same character with\r\nthat used in the other case. These hogsheads should stand where the water\r\nof a small roof, (as that of a hog-pen,) may be led into them, by an\r\narrangement which shall give an equal quantity to each;--this will give\r\nthem rather more than the simple rain-fall, but will leave them exposed to\r\nthe usual climatic changes of the season. A vessel, of a capacity of a\r\nquart or more, should be connected with each outlet, and covered from the\r\ndust,-- these will act as silt-basins. During the first few storms the\r\nwater will flow off much more freely from the first barrel; but, little by\r\nlittle, the second one, as the water finds its way through the clay, and\r\nas the occasional drying, and repeated filtration make it more porous,\r\nwill increase in its flow until it will, by the end of the season, or, at\r\nlatest, by the end of the second season, drain as well as the first, if,\r\nindeed, that be not by this time somewhat obstructed with silt. The amount\r\nof accumulation in the vessels at the outlet will show which process has\r\nbest kept back the silt, and the character of the deposit will show which\r\nwould most probably be carried off by the gentle flow of water in a nearly\r\nlevel drain.\r\n\r\nIt is no argument against this experiment that its results cannot be\r\ndetermined even in a year, for it is not pretended that drains laid in\r\ncompact clay will dry land so completely during the first month as those\r\nwhich give more free access to the water; only that they will do so in a\r\ncomparatively short time; and that, as drainage is a work for all time,\r\n(practically as lasting as the farm itself,) the importance of permanence\r\nand good working for long years to come, is out of all proportion to that\r\nof the temporary good results of one or two seasons, accompanied with\r\ndoubtful durability.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that _surface water_ will be more readily removed by\r\ndrains having porous filling. Even if this were true to any important\r\ndegree,--which it is not,--it would be an argument against the plan, for the\r\nremedy would be worse than the disease. If the water flow from the surface\r\ndown into the drain, it will not fail to carry dirt with it, and instead\r\nof the clear water, which alone should rise into the tiles from below, we\r\nshould have a trickling flow from above, muddy with wasted manure and\r\nsilty earth.\r\n\r\n_The remaining filling of the ditch_ is a matter of simple labor, and may\r\nbe done in whatever way may be most economical under the circumstances of\r\nthe work. If the amount to be filled is considerable, so that it is\r\ndesirable to use horse-power, the best way will be to use a scraper, such\r\nas is represented in Figure 39, which is a strongly ironed plank, 6 feet\r\nlong and 18 inches wide, sharp shod at one side, and supplied with handles\r\nat the other. It is propelled by means of the curved rods, which are\r\nattached to its under side by flexible joints. These rods are connected by\r\na chain which has links large enough to receive the hook of an ox-chain.\r\nThis scraper may be used for any straight-forward work by attaching the\r\npower to the middle of the chain. By moving the hook a few links to the\r\nright or left, it will act somewhat after the manner of the mould-board of\r\na plow, and will, if skillfully handled, shoot the filling rapidly into\r\nthe ditch.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Fig. 39 - BOARD SCRAPER FOR FILLING DITCHES.]\r\n\r\n               Fig. 39 - BOARD SCRAPER FOR FILLING DITCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the work is done by hand, mix the surface soil and turf with the\r\nsubsoil filling for the whole depth. If with a scraper, put the surface\r\nsoil at the bottom of the loose filling, and the subsoil at the top, as\r\nthis will be an imitation, for the limited area of the drains, of the\r\nprocess of \"trenching,\" which is used in garden cultivation.\r\n\r\nWhen the ditches are filled, they will be higher than the adjoining land,\r\nand it will be well to make them still more so by digging or plowing out a\r\nsmall trench at each side of the drain, throwing the earth against the\r\nmound, which will prevent surface water, (during heavy rains,) from\r\nrunning into the loose filling before it is sufficiently settled. A cross\r\nsection of a filled drain provided with these ditches is shown in Figure\r\n40.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 40 - CROSS-SECTION OF DITCH (FILLED), WITH FURROW\r\n                                AT EACH SIDE.]\r\n\r\n     Fig. 40 - CROSS-SECTION OF DITCH (FILLED), WITH FURROW AT EACH SIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that the silt-basins may be examined, and their accumulations of\r\nearth removed, during the early action of the drains, those parts of the\r\nditches which are above them may be left open, care being taken, by\r\ncutting surface ditches around them, to prevent the entrance of water from\r\nabove. During this time the covers of the basins should be kept on, and\r\nshould be covered with inverted sods to keep loose dirt from getting into\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n*Collecting the Water (C)f Springs.*--The lateral which connects with the\r\nmain drain, _A_, (Fig. 21,) at the point _m_, and which is to take the\r\nwater of the spring at the head of the brook, should not be opened until\r\nthe main has been completed and filled into the silt-basin,--the brook\r\nhaving, meantime, been carried over the other ditches in wooden troughs.\r\nThis lateral may now be made in the following way: Dig down to the tile of\r\nthe main, and carry the lateral ditch back, a distance of ten feet. In the\r\nbottom of this, place a wooden trough, at least six feet long, laid at\r\nsuch depth that its channel shall be on the exact grade required for\r\nlaying the tiles, and lay long straw, (held down by weights,) lengthwise\r\nwithin it. Make an opening in the tile of the main and connect the trough\r\nwith it. The straw will prevent any coarse particles of earth from being\r\ncarried into the tile, and the flow of the water will be sufficient to\r\ncarry on to the silt-basin any finer matters. Now open the ditch to and\r\nbeyond the spring, digging at least a foot below the grade in its\r\nimmediate vicinity, and filling to the exact grade with small stones,\r\nbroken bricks, or other suitable material. Lay the tiles from the upper\r\nend of the ditch across the stone work, and down to the wooden trough. Now\r\nspread a sufficient layer of wood shavings over the stone work to keep the\r\nearth from entering it, cover the tiles and fill in the ditch, as before\r\ndirected, and then remove the straw from the wooden trough and lay tiles\r\nin its place. In this way, the water of even a strong spring may be\r\ncarried into a finished drain without danger. In laying the tile which\r\ncrosses the stone work, it is well to use full 2-1/2-inch tiles in the\r\nplace of collars, leaving the joints of these, and of the 1-1/4-inch\r\ntiles, (which should join near the middle of the collar tile,) about a\r\nquarter of an inch open, to give free entrance to the water.\r\n\r\nThe stone and tile drain, _H, I_, is simply dug out to the surface of the\r\nrock, if this is not more than two feet below the grade of the upper ends\r\nof the laterals with which it connects, and then filled up with loose\r\nstones to the line of grade. If the stones are small, so as to form a good\r\nbottom for the tiles, they may be laid directly upon it; if not, a bottom\r\nfor them may be made of narrow strips of cheap boards. Before filling, the\r\ntiles and stone work should be covered with shavings, and the filling\r\nabove these should consist of a strong clay, which will remain in place\r\nafter the shavings rot away.\r\n\r\n*Amending the Map.*--When the tiles are laid, and before they are covered,\r\nall deviations of the lines, as in passing around large stones and other\r\nobstructions, which may have prevented the exact execution of the original\r\nplan, and the location and kind of each underground silt-basin should also\r\nbe carefully noted, so that they may be transferred to the map, for future\r\nreference, in the event of repairs becoming necessary. In a short time\r\nafter the work is finished, the surface of the field will show no trace of\r\nthe lines of drain, and it should be possible, in case of need, to find\r\nany point of the drains with precision, so that no labor will be lost in\r\ndigging for it. It is much cheaper to measure over the surface than to dig\r\nfour feet trenches through the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. - HOW TO TAKE CARE OF DRAINS AND DRAINED LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as tile drains are concerned, if they are once well laid, and if\r\nthe silt-basins have been emptied of silt until the water has ceased to\r\ndeposit it, they need no care nor attention, beyond an occasional cleaning\r\nof the outlet brook. Now and then, from the proximity of willows, or\r\nthrifty, young, water-loving trees, a drain will be obstructed by roots;\r\nor, during the first few years after the work is finished, some weak\r\npoint,--a badly laid tile, a loosely fitted connection between the lateral\r\nand a main, or an accumulation of silt coming from an undetected and\r\npersistent vein of quicksand,--will be developed, and repairs will have to\r\nbe made. Except for the slight danger from roots, which must always be\r\nguarded against to the extent of allowing no young trees of the dangerous\r\nclass to grow near a drain through which a _constant_ stream of water\r\nflows, it may be fairly assumed that drains which have been kept in order\r\nfor four or five years have passed the danger of interruption from any\r\ncause, and they may be considered entirely safe.\r\n\r\nA drain will often, for some months after it is laid, run muddy water\r\nafter rains. Sometimes the early deposit of silt will nearly fill the\r\ntile, and it will take the water of several storms to wash it out. If the\r\ntiles have been laid in packed clay, they cannot long receive silt from\r\nwithout, and that which makes the flow turbid, may be assumed to come from\r\nthe original deposit in the conduit. Examinations of newly laid drains\r\nhave developed many instances where tiles were at first half filled with\r\nsilt, and three months later were entirely clean. The muddiness of the\r\nflow indicates what the doctors call \"an effort of nature to relieve\r\nherself,\" and nature may be trusted to succeed, at least, until she\r\nabandons the effort. If we are sure that a drain has been well laid, we\r\nneed feel no anxiety because it fails to take the water from the ground so\r\ncompletely as it should do, until it settles into a flow of clear water\r\nafter the heaviest storms.\r\n\r\nIn the case of art actual stoppage, which will generally be indicated by\r\nthe \"bursting out\" of the drain, i.e., the wetting of the land as though\r\nthere were a spring under it, or as though its water had no underground\r\noutlet, (which is the fact,) it will be necessary to lay open the drain\r\nuntil the obstruction is found.\r\n\r\nIn this work, the real value of the map will be shown, by the facility\r\nwhich it offers for finding any point of any line of drains, and the exact\r\nlocality of the junctions with the mains, and of the silt-basins. In\r\nlaying out the plan on the ground, and in making his map, the surveyor\r\nwill have had recourse to two or more fixed points; one of them, in our\r\nexample, (fig. 21,) would probably be the center of the main silt-basin,\r\nand one, a drilled hole or other mark on the rock at the north side of the\r\nfield. By staking out on the ground the straight line connecting these two\r\npoints, and drawing a corresponding line on the map; we shall have a\r\n_base-line_, from which it will be easy, by perpendicular offsets, to\r\ndetermine on the ground any point upon the map. By laying a small square\r\non the map, with one of its edges coinciding with the base-line, and\r\nmoving it on this line until the other edge meets the desired point, we\r\nfix, at the angle of the square, the point on the base-line from which we\r\nare to measure the length of the offset. The next step is to find, (by the\r\nscale,) the distance of this point from the nearest end of the base-line,\r\nand from the point sought. Then measure off, in the field, the\r\ncorresponding distance on the base-line, and, from the point thus found,\r\nmeasure on a line perpendicular to the base line, the length of the\r\noffset; the point thus indicated will be the locality sought. In the same\r\nmanner, find another point on the same drain, to give the range on which\r\nto stake it out. From this line, the drains which run parallel to it, can\r\neasily be found, or it may be used as a base-line, from which to find, by\r\nmeasuring offsets, other points near it.\r\n\r\nThe object of this staking is, to find, in an inexpensive and easy way,\r\nthe precise position of the drains, for which it would be otherwise\r\nnecessary to grope in the dark, verifying our guesses by digging four-foot\r\ntrenches, at random.\r\n\r\nIf there is a silt-basin, or a junction a short distance below the point\r\nwhere the water shows itself, this will be the best place to dig. If it is\r\na silt-basin, we shall probably find that this has filled up with dirt,\r\nand has stopped the flow. In this case it should be cleaned out, and a\r\npoint of the drain ten feet below it examined. If this is found to be\r\nclear, a long slender stick may be pushed up as far as the basin and\r\nworked back and forth until the passage is cleared. Then replace the tile\r\nbelow, and try with the stick to clean the tiles above the basin, so as to\r\ntap the water above the obstruction. If this cannot be done, or if the\r\ndrain ten feet below is clogged, it will be necessary to uncover the tiles\r\nin both directions until an opening is found, and to take up and relay the\r\nwhole. If the wetting of the ground is sufficient to indicate that there\r\nis much water in the drain, only five or six tiles should be taken up at a\r\ntime, cleaned and relaid,--commencing at the lower end,--in order that, when\r\nthe water commences to flow, it may not disturb the bottom of the ditch\r\nfor the whole distance.\r\n\r\nIf the point opened is at a junction with the main, examine both the main\r\nand the lateral, to see which is stopped, and proceed with one or the\r\nother, as directed above. In doing this work, care should be taken to send\r\nas little muddy water as possible into the drain below, and to allow the\r\nleast possible disturbance of the bottom.\r\n\r\nIf silt-basins have been placed at those points at which the fall\r\ndiminishes, the obstruction will usually be found to occur at the outlets\r\nof these, from a piling up of the silt in front of them, and to extend\r\nonly a short distance below and above. It is not necessary to take up the\r\ntiles until they are found to be entirely clean, for, if they are only\r\none-half or one-third full, they will probably be washed clean by the rush\r\nof water, when that which is accumulated above is tapped. The work should\r\nbe done in settled fair weather, and the ditches should remain open until\r\nthe effect of the flow has been observed. If the tiles are made thoroughly\r\nclean by the time that the accumulated water has run off, say in 24 hours,\r\nthey may be covered up; if not, it may be necessary to remove them again,\r\nand clean them by hand. When the work is undertaken it should be\r\nthoroughly done, so that the expense of a new opening need not be again\r\nincurred.\r\n\r\nIt is worse than useless to substitute larger sizes of tiles for those\r\nwhich are taken up. The obstruction, if by silt, is the result of a too\r\nsluggish flow, and to enlarge the area of the conduit would only increase\r\nthe difficulty. If the tiles are too small to carry the full flow which\r\nfollows a heavy rain, they will be very unlikely to become choked, for the\r\nwater will then have sufficient force to wash them clean, while if they\r\nare much larger than necessary, a deposit of silt to one half of their\r\nheight will make a broad, flat bed for the stream, which will run with\r\nmuch less force, and will be more likely to increase the deposit.\r\n\r\nIf the drains are obstructed by the roots of willows, or other trees, the\r\nproprietor must decide whether he will sacrifice the trees or the drains;\r\nboth he cannot keep, unless he chooses to go to the expense of laying in\r\ncement all of the drains which carry constant streams, for a distance of\r\nat least 50 feet from the dangerous trees. The trouble from trees is\r\noccasionally very great, but its occurrence is too rare for general\r\nconsideration, and must be met in each case with such remedies as\r\ncircumstances suggest as the best.\r\n\r\nThe gratings over the outlets of silt-basins which open at the surface of\r\nthe ground, are sometimes, during the first year of the drainage,\r\nobstructed by a fungoid growth which collects on the cross bars. This\r\nshould be occasionally rubbed off. Its character is not very well\r\nunderstood, and it is rarely observed in old drains. The decomposition of\r\nthe grass bands which are used to cover the joints of the larger tiles may\r\nencourage its formation.\r\n\r\nIf the surface soil have a good proportion of sand, gravel, or organic\r\nmatter, so as to give it the consistency which is known as \"loamy,\" it\r\nwill bear any treatment which it may chance to receive in cultivation, or\r\nas pasture land; but if it be a decided clay soil, no amount of draining\r\nwill enable us to work it, or to turn cattle upon it when it is wet with\r\nrecent rains. It will much sooner become dry, because of the drainage, and\r\nmay much sooner be trodden upon without injury; but wet clay cannot be\r\nworked or walked over without being more or less _puddled_, and, thereby,\r\ninjured for a long time.\r\n\r\nNo matter how thoroughly heavy clay pasture lands may be under-drained,\r\nthe cattle should be removed from them when it rains, and kept off until\r\nthey are comparatively dry. Neglect of this precaution has probably led to\r\nmore disappointment as to the effects of drainage than any other\r\ncircumstances connected with it. The injury from this cause does not\r\nextend to a great depth, and in the Northern States it would always be\r\novercome by the frosts of a single winter; as has been before stated, it\r\nis confined to stiff clay soils, but as these are the soils which most\r\nneed draining, the warning given is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. - WHAT DRAINING COSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDraining is expensive work. This fact must be accepted as a very stubborn\r\none, by every man who proposes to undertake the improvement. There is no\r\nroyal road to tile-laying, and the beginner should count the cost at the\r\noutset. A good many acres of virgin land at the West might be bought for\r\nwhat must be paid to get an efficient system of drains laid under a single\r\nacre at home. Any man who stops at this point of the argument will\r\nprobably move West,--or do nothing.\r\n\r\nYet, it is susceptible of demonstration that, even at the West, in those\r\nlocalities where Indian Corn is worth as much as fifty cents per bushel at\r\nthe farm, it will pay to drain, in the best manner, all such land as is\r\ndescribed in the first chapter of this book as in need of draining.\r\nArguments to prove this need not be based at all on cheapness of the work;\r\nonly on its effects and its permanence.\r\n\r\nIn fact, so far as draining with tiles is concerned, cheapness is a\r\ndelusion and a snare, for the reason that it implies something less than\r\nthe best work, a compromise between excellence and inferiority. The moment\r\nthat we come down from the best standard, we introduce a new element into\r\nthe calculation. The sort of tile draining which it is the purpose of this\r\nwork to advocate is a system so complete in every particular, that it may\r\nbe considered as an absolutely permanent improvement. During the first\r\nyears of the working of the drains, they will require more or less\r\nattention, and some expense for repairs; but, in well constructed work,\r\nthese will be very slight, and will soon cease altogether. In proportion\r\nas we resort to cheap devices, which imply a neglect of important parts of\r\nthe work, and a want of thoroughness in the whole, the expense for repairs\r\nwill increase, and the duration of the usefulness of the drains will\r\ndiminish.\r\n\r\nDrains which are permanently well made, and which will, practically, last\r\nfor all time, may be regarded as a good investment, the increased crop of\r\neach year, paying a good interest on the money that they cost, and the\r\nmoney being still represented by the undiminished value of the\r\nimprovement. In such a case the draining of the land may be said to cost,\r\nnot $50 per acre,--but the interest on $50 each year. The original amount\r\nis well invested, and brings its yearly dividend as surely as though it\r\nwere represented by a five-twenty bond.\r\n\r\nWith badly constructed drains, on the other hand, the case is quite\r\ndifferent. In buying land which is subject to no loss in quantity or\r\nquality, the farmer considers, not so much the actual cost, as the\r\nrelation between the yearly interest on the cost, and the yearly profit on\r\nthe crop,--knowing that, a hundred years hence, the land will still be\r\nworth his money.\r\n\r\nBut if the land were bounded on one side by a river which yearly\r\nencroached some feet on its bank, leaving the field a little smaller after\r\neach freshet; or if, every spring, some rods square of its surface were\r\nsure to be covered three feet deep with stones and sand, so that the\r\nactual value of the property became every year less, the purchaser would\r\ncompare the yearly value of the crops, not only with the interest on the\r\nprice, but, in addition to this, with so much of the prime value as yearly\r\ndisappears with the destruction of the land.\r\n\r\nIt is exactly so with the question of the cost of drainage. If the work is\r\ninsecurely done, and is liable, in five years or in fifty, to become\r\nworthless; the increase of the crops resulting from it, must not only\r\ncover the yearly interest on the cost, but the yearly depreciation as\r\nwell. Therefore what may seem at the time of doing the work to be\r\ncheapness, is really the greatest extravagance. It is like building a\r\nbrick wall with clay for mortar. The bricks and the workmanship cost full\r\nprice, and the small saving on the mortar will topple the wall over in a\r\nfew years, while, if well cemented, it would have lasted for centuries.\r\nThe cutting and filling of the ditches, and the purchase and\r\ntransportation of the tiles, will cost the same in every case, and these\r\nconstitute the chief cost; if the proper care in grading, tile-laying and\r\ncovering, and in making outlets be stingily withheld,--saving, perhaps,\r\none-tenth of the expense,--what might have been a permanent improvement to\r\nthe land, may disappear, and the whole outlay be lost in ten years. A\r\nsaving of ten per cent. in the cost will have lost us the other ninety in\r\na short time.\r\n\r\nBut, while cheapness is to be shunned, economy is to be sought in every\r\nitem of the work of draining, and should be studied, by proprietor and\r\nengineer, from the first examination of the land, to the throwing of the\r\nlast shovelful of earth on to the filling of the ditch. There are few\r\noperations connected with the cultivation of the soil in which so much may\r\nbe imperceptibly lost through neglect, and carelessness about little\r\ndetails, as in tile-draining. In the original levelling of the ground, the\r\nadjustment of the lines, the establishing of the most judicious depth and\r\ninclination at each point of the drains, the disposition of surface\r\nstreams during the prosecution of the work, and in the width of the\r\nexcavation, the line which divides economy and wastefulness is extremely\r\nnarrow and the most constant vigilance, together with the best judgment\r\nand foresight, are needed to avoid unnecessary cost. In the laying and\r\ncovering of the tile, on the other hand, it is best to disregard a little\r\nslowness and unnecessary care on the part of the workmen, for the sake of\r\nthe most perfect security of the work.\r\n\r\n*Details of Cost.*--The items of the work of drainage may be classified as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Engineering and Superintendence.\r\n\r\n2. Digging the ditches.\r\n\r\n3. Grading the bottoms.\r\n\r\n4. Tile and tile-laying.\r\n\r\n5. Covering the tile and filling the ditches.\r\n\r\n6. Outlets and silt-basins.\r\n\r\n1. _Engineering and Superintendence._--It is not easy to say what would be\r\nthe proper charge for this item of the work. In England, the Commissioners\r\nunder the Drainage Acts of Parliament, and the Boards of Public Works, fix\r\nthe charge for engineering at $1.25 per acre. That is in a country when\r\nthe extent of lands undergoing the process of draining is very great,\r\nenabling one person to superintend large tracts in the same neighborhood\r\nat the same time, and with little or no outlay for travelling expenses. In\r\nthis country, where the improvement is, thus far, confined to small areas,\r\nwidely separated; and where there are comparatively few engineers who make\r\na specialty of the work, the charge for services is necessarily much\r\nhigher, and the amount expended in travelling much greater. In most cases,\r\nthe proprietor of the land must qualify himself to superintend his own\r\noperations, (with the aid of a country surveyor, or a railroad engineer in\r\nthe necessary instrumental work.) As draining becomes more general, the\r\ndemand for professional assistance will, without doubt, cause local\r\nengineers to turn their attention to the subject, and their services may\r\nbe more cheaply obtained. At present, it would probably not be prudent to\r\nestimate the cost of engineering and superintendence, including the time\r\nand skill of the proprietor, at less than $5 per acre, even where from 20\r\nto 50 acres are to be drained at once.\r\n\r\n2. _Digging the Ditches._--The labor required for the various operations\r\nconstitutes the principal item of cost in draining, and the price of labor\r\nis now so different in different localities, and so unsettled in all, that\r\nit is difficult to determine a rate which would be generally fair. It will\r\nbe assumed that the average wages of day laborers of the class employed in\r\ndigging ditches, is $1.50 per day, and the calculation will have to be\r\nchanged for different districts, in proportion to the deviation of the\r\nactual rate of wages from this amount. There is a considerable advantage\r\nin having the work done at some season, (as after the summer harvest, or\r\nlate in the fall,) when wages are comparatively low.\r\n\r\nThe cutting of the ditches should always be let by the rod. When working\r\nat day's work, the men will invariably open them wider than is necessary,\r\nfor the sake of the greater convenience of working, and the extra width\r\ncauses a corresponding waste of labor.\r\n\r\nA 4-foot ditch, in most soils, need be only 20 inches wide at the surface,\r\nand 4 inches at the bottom. This gives a mean width of 12 inches, and\r\nrequires the removal of nearly 2-1/2 cubic yards of earth for each rod of\r\nditch; but an increase to a mean width of 16 inches, (which day workmen\r\nwill usually reach, while piece workmen almost never will,) requires the\r\nremoval of 3-1/4 cubic yards to the rod. As the increased width is usually\r\nbelow the middle of the drain, the extra earth will all have to be raised\r\nfrom 2 to 4 feet, and the extra 3/4 yards will cost as much as a full yard\r\ntaken evenly from the whole side, from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nIn clay soils, free from stones or \"hard pan,\" but so stiff as to require\r\nconsiderable picking, ordinary workmen, after a little practice, will be\r\nable to dig 3-1/2 rods of ditch per day, to an average depth of\r\n3.80,--leaving from 2 to 3 inches of the bottom of 4-foot ditches to be\r\nfinished by the graders. This makes the cost of digging about 43 cents per\r\nrod. In loamy soil the cost will be a little less than this, and in very\r\nhard ground, a little more. In sandy and peaty soils, the cost will not be\r\nmore than 30 cents. Probably 43 cents would be a fair average for soils\r\nrequiring drainage, throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThis is about 17 cents for each yard of earth removed.\r\n\r\nIn soft ground, the caving in of the banks will require a much greater\r\nmean width than 12 inches to be thrown out, and, if the accident could not\r\nhave been prevented by ordinary care on the part of the workman, (using\r\nthe bracing boards shown in Fig. 28,) he should receive extra pay for the\r\nextra work. In passing around large stones it may also be necessary to\r\nincrease the width.\r\n\r\nThe following table will facilitate the calculations for such extra work:\r\n\r\n          CUBIC YARDS OF EXCAVATION IN DITCHES OF VARIOUS WIDTH.\r\n_Length of   12 _Inches   18 _Inches   24 _Inches   30 _Inches   36 _Inches\r\nDitch._      Wide._       Wide._       Wide._       Wide._       Wide._\r\n             Yds.

In stony land, the men\r\nshould be required to keep their work well closed up,--excavating to the\r\nfull depth as they go. Then, if they strike a stone too large to be taken\r\nout within the terms of their contract, they can skip a sufficient\r\ndistance to pass it, and the digging of the omitted part may be done by a\r\nfaithful day workman. This will usually be cheaper and more satisfactory\r\nthan to pay the contractors for extra work.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Fig. 41 - FOOT PICK.]\r\n\r\n                             Fig. 41 - FOOT PICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the amount of work that one man can do in a day, in different\r\nsoils, digging ditches 4 feet deep, French says: \"In the writer's own\r\nfield, where the pick was used to loosen the lower two feet of earth, the\r\nlabor of opening and _filling_ drains 4 feet deep, and of the mean width\r\nof 14 inches, all by hand labor, has been, in a mile of drains, being our\r\nfirst experiments, about one day's labor to 3 rods in length. The\r\nexcavated earth of such a drain measures not quite 3 cubic yards,\r\n(exactly, 2.85.)\" In a subsequent work, in a sandy soil, two men opened,\r\n_laid_, and _refilled_ 14 rods in one day;--the mean width being 12\r\ninches.(21)\r\n\r\n\"In the same season, the same men opened, _laid_, and _filled_ 70 rods of\r\n4-foot drain of the same mean width of 12 inches, in the worst kind of\r\nclay soil, where the pick was constantly used. It cost 35 days' labor to\r\ncomplete the job, being 50 cents _per_ rod for the labor alone.\" Or, under\r\nthe foregoing calculation of $1.50 per day, 75 cents per rod. These\r\nestimates, in common with nearly all that are published, are for the\r\nentire work of digging, grading, tile-laying, and refilling. Deducting the\r\ntime required for the other work, the result will be about as above\r\nestimated; for the rough excavation, 3 1/2-rods to the day's work,\r\ncosting, at $1.50 per day, 43 cents to the rod.\r\n\r\n_Grading_ is the removal of 2 or 3 inches in depth, and about 4 inches in\r\nwidth, of the soil at the bottom of the ditch. It is chiefly done with the\r\nfinishing scoop, which, (being made of two thin plates, one of iron and\r\none of steel, welded together, the iron wearing away and leaving the sharp\r\nsteel edge always prominent,) will work in a very hard clay without the\r\naid of the pick. Three men,--the one in the ditch being a skillful workman,\r\nand the others helping him when not sighting the rods,--will grade about\r\n100 rods per day, making the cost about 6 cents per rod. Until they\r\nacquire the skill to work thus rapidly, they should not be urged beyond\r\nwhat they can readily do in the best manner, as this operation, (which is\r\nthe preparing of the foundation for the tiles,) is probably the most\r\nimportant of the whole work of draining.\r\n\r\n_Tiles and Tile-Laying._--After allowing for breakage, it will take about\r\n16 tiles and 16 collars to lay a rod in length of drain. The cost of these\r\nwill, of course, be very much affected by the considerations of the\r\nnearness of the tile-kiln and the cost of transportation. They should, in\r\nno ordinary case, cost, delivered on the ground, more than $8 per thousand\r\nfor 1-1/4-inch tiles, and $4 per thousand for the collars, making a total\r\nof $12 for both, equal to about 19 cents per rod. The laying of the tiles,\r\nmay be set down at 2 cents per rod,--based on a skilled man laying 100 rods\r\ndaily, and receiving $2 per day.\r\n\r\n_Covering and filling_ will probably cost 10 cents per rod, (if the\r\nscraper, Fig. 39, can be successfully used for the rough filling, the cost\r\nwill be reduced considerably below this.)\r\n\r\nThe four items of the cost of making one rod of lateral drain are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nDigging the ditches    - - - .43\r\nGrading                - - - .06\r\nTiles and laying       - - - .21\r\nCovering and filling   - - - .10\r\n- - -.80 cts.\r\n\r\nIf the drains are placed at intervals of 40 feet, there are required 64\r\nrods to the acre,--this at 80 cents per rod will make the cost per\r\nacre,--for the above items,--$51.20.\r\n\r\nHow much should be allowed for main drains, outlets, and silt-basins, it\r\nis impossible to say, as, on irregular ground, no two fields will require\r\nthe same amount of this sort of work. On very even land, where the whole\r\nsurface, for hundreds of acres, slopes gradually in one or two directions,\r\nthe outlay for mains need not be more than two per cent. of the cost of\r\nthe laterals. This would allow laterals of a uniform length of 800 feet to\r\ndischarge into the main line, at intervals of 40 feet, if we do not\r\nconsider the trifling extra cost of the larger tiles. On less regular\r\nground, the cost of mains will often be considerably more than two per\r\ncent. of the cost of the laterals; but in some instances the increase of\r\nmain lines will be fully compensated for by the reduction in the length of\r\nthe laterals, which, owing to rocks, hills too steep to need drains at\r\nregular intervals, and porous, (gravelly,) streaks in the land, cannot be\r\nprofitably made to occupy the whole area so thoroughly.(22)\r\n\r\nProbably 7-1/2 per cent. of the cost of the laterals for mains, outlets,\r\nand silt-basins will be a fair average allowance.\r\n\r\nThis will bring the total cost of the work to about $60 per acre, made up\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nCost of the finished drains per acre  - - -  $51.20\r\n\r\n7-1/2 per cent. added for mains, etc. - - -    3.83\r\n\r\nEngineering and Superintendence       - - -    5.00\r\n\r\nOf course this is an arbitrary calculation, an estimate without a single\r\nascertained fact to go upon,--but it is as close as it can be made to what\r\nwould probably be the cost of the best work, on average ground, at the\r\npresent high prices of labor and material. Five years ago the same work\r\ncould have been done for from $40 to $45 per acre, and it will be again\r\ncheaper when wages fall, and when a greater demand for draining tiles\r\nshall have caused more competition in their manufacture. With a large\r\ngeneral demand, such as has existed in England for the last 20 years, they\r\nwould now be sold for one-half of their present price here, and the\r\nmanufacture would be more profitable.\r\n\r\nThere are many light lands on retentive subsoils, which could be drained,\r\nat present prices, for $50 or less per acre, and there are others, which\r\nare very hard to dig, on which thorough-draining could not now be done for\r\n$60.\r\n\r\nThe cost and the promise of the operation in each instance, must guide the\r\nland owner in deciding whether or not to undertake the improvement.\r\n\r\nIn doubtful cases, there is one compromise which may be safely made,--that\r\nis, to omit each alternate drain, and defer its construction until labor\r\nis cheaper.\r\n\r\nThis is doing half the work,--a very different thing from half-doing the\r\nwork. In such cases, the lines should be laid out as though they were to\r\nbe all done at once, and, finally, when the omitted drains are made, it\r\nshould be in pursuance of the original plan. Probably the drains which are\r\nlaid will produce more than one-half of the benefit that would result if\r\nthey were all laid, but they will rarely be satisfactory, except as a\r\ntemporary expedient, and the saving will be less than would at first seem\r\nlikely, for when the second drains are laid; the cultivation of the land\r\nmust be again interrupted; the draining force must be again brought\r\ntogether; the levels of the new lines must be taken, and connected with\r\nthose of the old ones; and great care must be taken, selecting the dryest\r\nweather for the work,--to admit very little, if any, muddy water into the\r\nold mains.\r\n\r\nThis practice of draining by installments is not recommended; it is only\r\nsuggested as an allowable expedient, when the cost of the complete work\r\ncould not be borne with out inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIf any staid and economical farmer is disposed to be alarmed at the cost\r\nof draining, he is respectfully reminded of the miles of expensive stone\r\nwalls and other fences, in New England and many other parts of the\r\ncountry, which often are a real detriment to the farms, occupying, with\r\ntheir accompanying bramble bushes and head lands, acres of valuable land,\r\nand causing great waste of time in turning at the ends of short furrows in\r\nplowing;--while they produce no benefit at all adequate to their cost and\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\nIt should also be considered that, just as the cost of fences is scarcely\r\nfelt by the farmer, being made when his teams and hands could not be\r\nprofitably employed in ordinary farming operations, so the cost of\r\ndraining will be reduced in proportion to the amount of the work which he\r\ncan \"do within himself,\"--without hiring men expressly for it. The estimate\r\nherein given is based on the supposition that men are hired for the work,\r\nat wages equal to $1.50 per day,--while draining would often furnish a\r\ngreat advantage to the farmer in giving employment to farm hands who are\r\npaid and subsisted by the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. - \"WILL IT PAY?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting with the basis of $60, as the cost of draining an acre of\r\nordinary farm land;--what is the prospect that the work will prove\r\nremunerative?\r\n\r\nIn all of the older States, farmers are glad to lend their surplus funds,\r\non bond and mortgage on their neighbors' farms, with interest at the rate\r\nof 7, and often 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that a little attention must be given each year to the\r\noutlets, and, to the silt-basins, as well, for the first few years, it\r\nwill be just to charge for the use of the capital 8-1/3 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis will make a yearly charge on the land, for the benefits resulting\r\nfrom such a system of draining as has been described, OF FIVE DOLLARS PER\r\nACRE.\r\n\r\n_Will it Pay?_--Will the benefits accruing, year after year,--in wet seasons\r\nand in dry,--with root crops and with grain,--with hay and with fruit,--in\r\nrotations of crops and in pasture,--be worth $5 an acre?\r\n\r\nOn this question depends the value of tile-draining as a _practical_\r\nimprovement, for if there is a self-evident proposition in agriculture, it\r\nis that what is not profitable, one year with another, is _not_ practical.\r\n\r\nTo counterbalance the charge of $5, as the yearly cost of the draining,\r\neach acre must produce, in addition to what it would have yielded without\r\nthe improvement:\r\n\r\n10    bushels of Corn    at   .50 per bushel.\r\n\r\n3     bushels of Wheat   at $1.66 per bushel.\r\n\r\n5     bushels of Rye     at  1.00  per bushel.\r\n\r\n12-1/2 bushels of Oats    at   .40 per bushel.\r\n\r\n10    bushels of  Potatoes at   .50 per bushel.\r\n\r\n6-2/3 bushels of  Barley   at   .75 per bushel.\r\n\r\n1,000 pounds  of  Hay      at 10.00 per  ton.\r\n\r\n50   pounds  of Cotton   at   .10  per pound.\r\n\r\n20   pounds  of  Tobacco  at   .25  per pound.\r\n\r\nSurely this is not a large increase,--not in a single case,--and the prices\r\nare generally less than may be expected for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe United States Census Report places the average crop of Indian Corn, in\r\nIndiana and Illinois, at 33 bushels per acre. In New York it was but 27\r\nbushels, and in Pennsylvania but 20 bushels. It would certainly be\r\naccounted extremely liberal to fix the average yield of such soils as need\r\ndraining, at 30 bushels per acre. It is extremely unlikely that they would\r\nyield this, in the average of seasons, with the constantly recurring\r\ninjury from backward springs, summer droughts, and early autumn frosts.\r\n\r\nHeavy, retentive soils, which are cold and late in the spring, subject to\r\nhard baking in midsummer, and to become cold and wet in the early fall,\r\nare the very ones which are best suited, when drained, to the growth of\r\nIndian Corn. They are \"strong\" and fertile,--and should be able to absorb,\r\nand to prepare for the use of plants, the manure which is applied to them,\r\nand the fertilizing matters which are brought to them by each storm;--but\r\nthey cannot properly exercise the functions of fertile soils, for the\r\nreason that they are strangled with water, chilled by evaporation, or\r\nbaked to almost brick-like hardness, during nearly the whole period of the\r\ngrowth and ripening of the crop. The manure which has been added to them,\r\nas well as their own chemical constituents, are prevented from undergoing\r\nthose changes which are necessary to prepare them for the uses of\r\nvegetation. The water of rains, finding the spaces in the soil already\r\noccupied by the water of previous rains, cannot enter to deposit the gases\r\nwhich it contains,--or, if the soil has been dried by evaporation under the\r\ninfluence of sun and wind, the surface is almost hermetically sealed, and\r\nthe water is only slowly soaked up, much of it running off over the\r\nsurface, or lying to be removed by the slow and chilling process of\r\nevaporation. In wet times and in dry, the air, with its heat, its oxygen,\r\nand its carbonic acid, (its universal solvent,) is forbidden to enter and\r\ndo its beneficent work. The benefit resulting from cultivating the surface\r\nof the ground is counteracted by the first unfavorable change of the\r\nweather; a single heavy rain, by saturating the soil, returning it to\r\nnearly its original condition of clammy compactness. In favorable seasons,\r\nthese difficulties are lessened, but man has no control over the seasons,\r\nand to-morrow may be as foul as to-day has been fair. A crop of corn on\r\nundrained, retentive ground, is subject to injury from disastrous changes\r\nof the weather, from planting until harvest. Even supposing that, in the\r\nmost favorable seasons, it would yield as largely as though the ground\r\nwere drained, it would lose enough in unfavorable seasons to reduce the\r\naverage more than ten (10) bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThe average crop, on such land, has been assumed to be 30 bushels per\r\nacre; it would be an estimate as moderate as this one is generous, to say\r\nthat, with the same cultivation and the same manure, the average crop,\r\nafter draining, would be 50 bushels, or an increase equal to twice as much\r\nas is needed to pay the draining charge. If the method of cultivation is\r\nimproved, by deep plowing, ample manuring, and thorough working,--all of\r\nwhich may be more profitably applied to drained than to undrained\r\nland,--the _average_ crop,--of a series of years,--will not be less than 60\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\nThe cost of extra harvesting will be more than repaid by the value of the\r\nextra fodder, and the increased cultivation and manuring are lasting\r\nbenefits, which can be charged, only in small part, to the current crop.\r\nTherefore, if it will pay to plow, plant, hoe and harvest for 30 bushels\r\nof corn, it will surely pay much better to double the crop at a yearly\r\nextra cost of $5, and, practically, it amounts to this;--the extra crop is\r\nnearly all clear gain.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of Wheat required to repay the annual charge for drainage is\r\nso small, that no argument is needed to show that any process which will\r\nsimply prevent \"throwing out\" in winter, and the failure of the plant in\r\nthe wetter parts of the field, will increase the product more than that\r\namount,--to say nothing of the general importance to this crop of having\r\nthe land in the most perfect condition, (in winter as well as in summer.)\r\n\r\nIt is stated that, since the general introduction of drainage in England,\r\n(within the past 25 years,) the wheat crop of that country has been more\r\nthan doubled. Of course, it does not necessarily follow that the amount\r\n_per acre_ has been doubled, large areas which were originally unfit for\r\nthe growth of this crop, having been, by draining, excellently fitted for\r\nits cultivation;--but there can be no doubt that its yield has been greatly\r\nincreased on all drained lands, nor that large areas, which, before being\r\ndrained, were able to produce fair crops only in the best seasons, are now\r\nmade very nearly independent of the weather.\r\n\r\nIt is not susceptible of demonstration, but it is undoubtedly true, that\r\nthose clay or other heavy soils, which are devoted to the growth of wheat\r\nin this country, would, if they were thoroughly under-drained, produce, on\r\nthe average of years, at least double their present crop.\r\n\r\nMr. John Johnston, a venerable Scotch farmer, who has long been a\r\nsuccessful cultivator in the Wheat region of Western New York,--and who was\r\nalmost the pioneer of tile-draining in America,--has laid over 50 miles of\r\ndrains within the last 30 years. His practice is described in Klippart's\r\nLand Drainage, from which work we quote the following:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Johnston says he never saw 100 acres in any one farm, but a portion\r\nof it would pay for draining. Mr. Johnston is no rich man who has carried\r\na favorite hobby without regard to cost or profit. He is a hardworking\r\nScotch farmer, who commenced a poor man, borrowed money to drain his land,\r\nhas gradually extended his operations, and is now reaping the benefits, in\r\nhaving crops of 40 bushels of wheat to the acre. He is a gray-haired\r\nNestor, who, after accumulating the experience of a long life, is now, at\r\n68 years of age, written to by strangers in every State of the Union for\r\ninformation, not only in drainage matters, but all cognate branches of\r\nfarming. He sits in his homestead, a veritable Humboldt in his way,\r\ndispensing information cheerfully through our agricultural papers and to\r\nprivate correspondents, of whom he has recorded 164 who applied to him\r\nlast year. His opinions are, therefore, worth more than those of a host of\r\ntheoretical men, who write without practice.\" * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Although his farm is mainly devoted to wheat, yet a considerable area of\r\nmeadow and some pasture has been retained. He now owns about 300 acres of\r\nland. The yield of wheat has been 40 bushels this year, and in former\r\nseasons, when his neighbors were reaping 8, 10, or 15 bushels, he has had\r\n30 and 40.\" * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Johnston says tile-draining pays for itself in two seasons, sometimes\r\nin one. Thus, in 1847, he bought a piece of 10 acres to get an outlet for\r\nhis drains. It was a perfect quagmire, covered with coarse aquatic\r\ngrasses, and so unfruitful that it would not give back the seed sown upon\r\nit. In 1848 a crop of corn was taken from it, which was measured and found\r\nto be _eighty bushels_ per acre, and as, because of the Irish famine, corn\r\nwas worth $1 per bushel that year, this crop paid not only all the expense\r\nof drainage, but the first cost of the land as well.\r\n\r\n\"Another piece of 20 acres, adjoining the farm of the late John Delafield,\r\nwas wet, and would never bring more than 10 bushels of corn per acre. This\r\nwas drained at a great cost, nearly $30 per acre. The first crop after\r\nthis was 83 bushels and some odd pounds per acre. It was weighed and\r\nmeasured by Mr. Delafield, and the County Society awarded a premium to Mr.\r\nJohnston. Eight acres and some rods of this land, at one side, averaged 94\r\nbushels, or the trifling increase of 84 bushels per acre over what it\r\nwould bear before those insignificant clay tiles were buried in the\r\nground. But this increase of crop is not the only profit of drainage; for\r\nMr. Johnston says that, on drained land, one half the usual quantity of\r\nmanure suffices to give maximum crops. It is not difficult to find a\r\nreason for this. When the soil is sodden with water, air can not enter to\r\nany extent, and hence oxygen can not eat off the surfaces of\r\nsoil-particles and prepare food for plants; thus the plant must in great\r\nmeasure depend on the manure for sustenance, and, of course, the more this\r\nis the case, the more manure must be applied to get good crops. This is\r\none reason, but there are others which we might adduce if one good one\r\nwere not sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Johnston says he never made money until he drained, and so convinced\r\nis he of the benefits accruing from the practice, that he would not\r\nhesitate,--as he did not when the result was much more uncertain than at\r\npresent,--to borrow money to drain. Drains well laid, endure, but unless a\r\nfarmer intends doing the job well, he had best leave it alone and grow\r\npoor, and move out West, and all that sort of thing. Occupiers of\r\napparently dry land are not safe in concluding that they need not go to\r\nthe expense of draining, for if they will but dig a three-foot ditch in\r\neven the driest soil, water will be found in the bottom at the end of\r\neight hours, and if it does come, then draining will pay for itself\r\nspeedily.\"\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the Rural New Yorker published a letter from one of its\r\ncorrespondents from which the following is extracted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I recollect calling upon a gentleman in the harvest field, when\r\n    something like the following conversation occurred:\r\n\r\n    'Your wheat, sir, looks very fine; how many acres have you in this\r\n    field?'\r\n\r\n    'In the neighborhood of eight, I judge.'\r\n\r\n    'Did you sow upon fallow?'\r\n\r\n    'No sir. We turned over green sward--sowed immediately upon the\r\n    sod, and dragged it thoroughly--and you see the yield will probably\r\n    be 25 bushels to the acre, where it is not too wet.'\r\n\r\n    'Yes sir, it is mostly very fine. I observed a thin strip through\r\n    it, but did not notice that it was wet.'\r\n\r\n    'Well, it is not _very_ wet. Sometimes after a rain, the water\r\n    runs across it, and in spring and fall it is just wet enough to\r\n    heave the wheat and kill it.'\r\n\r\n    I inquired whether a couple of good drains across the lot would\r\n    not render it dry.\r\n\r\n    'Perhaps so--but there is not over an acre that is killed out.'\r\n\r\n    'Have you made an estimate of the loss you annually sustain from\r\n    this wet place?'\r\n\r\n    'No, I had not thought much about it.'\r\n\r\n    'Would $30 be too high?'\r\n\r\n    'O yes, double.'\r\n\r\n    'Well, let's see; it cost you $3 to turn over the sward? Two\r\n    bushels of seed, $2; harrowing in, 75 cents; interest, taxes, and\r\n    fences, $5.25; 25 bushels of wheat lost, $25.'\r\n\r\n    'Deduct for harvesting----'\r\n\r\n    'No; the straw would pay for that.'\r\n\r\n    'Very well, all footed $36.'\r\n\r\n    'What will the wheat and straw on this acre be worth this year?'\r\n\r\n    'Nothing, as I shall not cut the ground over.'\r\n\r\n    'Then it appears that you have lost, in what you have actually\r\n    expended, and the wheat you would have harvested, had the ground\r\n    been dry, $36, a pretty large sum for one acre.'\r\n\r\n    'Yes I see,' said the farmer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Rye may be grown, with tolerable advantage, on lands which are less\r\nperfectly drained than is necessary for Wheat, there can be no doubt that\r\nan increase of more than the six and two-thirds bushels needed to make up\r\nthe drainage charge will be the result of the improvement.\r\n\r\nWhile Oats will thrive in soils which are too wet for many other crops,\r\nthe ability to plant early, which is secured by an early removal from the\r\nsoil of its surplus water, will ensure, one year with another, more than\r\ntwelve and a half bushels of increased product.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Potatoes, also, the early planting will be a great\r\nadvantage; and, while the cause of the potato-rot is not yet clearly\r\ndiscovered, it is generally conceded that, even if it does not result\r\ndirectly from too great wetness of the soil, its development is favored by\r\nthis condition, either from a direct action on the tubers, or from the\r\neffect in the air immediately about the plants, of the exhalations of a\r\nhumid soil.\r\n\r\nAn increase of from five to ten per cent. on a very ordinary crop of\r\npotatoes, will cover the drainage charge, and with facilities for\r\nmarketing, the higher price of the earlier yield is of much greater\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nBarley will not thrive in wet soil, and there is no question that drainage\r\nwould give it much more than the increased yield prescribed above.\r\n\r\nAs to hay, there are many wet, rich soils which produce very large crops\r\nof grass, and it is possible that drainage might not always cause them to\r\nyield a thousand pounds more of hay to the acre, but the _quality_ of the\r\nhay from the drained soil, would, of itself, more than compensate for the\r\ndrainage charge. The great benefit of the improvement, with reference to\r\nthis crop, however, lies in the fact that, although wet, grass lands,--and\r\nby \"wet\" is meant the condition of undrained, retentive clays, and heavy\r\nloams, or other soils requiring drainage,--in a very few years \"run out,\"\r\nor become occupied by semi-aquatic and other objectionable plants, to the\r\nexclusion of the proper grasses; the same lands, thoroughly drained, may\r\nbe kept in full yield of the finest hay plants, as long as the ground is\r\nproperly managed. It must, of course, be manured, from time to time, and\r\ncare should be taken to prevent the puddling of its surface, by men or\r\nanimals, while it is too wet from recent rain. With proper attention to\r\nthese points, it need not be broken up in a lifetime, and it may be relied\r\non to produce uniformly good crops, always equal to the best obtained\r\nbefore drainage.\r\n\r\nSo far as Cotton and Tobacco are concerned, there are not many instances\r\nrecorded of the systematic drainage of lands appropriated to their\r\ncultivation, but there is every reason to suppose that they will both be\r\nbenefitted by any operation which will have the effect of placing the soil\r\nin a better condition for the uses of all cultivated plants. The average\r\ncrop of tobacco is about 700 lbs., and that of cotton probably 250 lbs. An\r\naddition of one-fifth to the cotton crop, and of only one thirty-fifth to\r\nthe tobacco crop, would make the required increase.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the cotton crop, during the past season, (1866,) might have\r\nbeen entirely prevented, in many districts, by the thorough draining of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for drainage with reference to the above-named\r\nstaple crops, will apply with equal, if not greater force, to all garden\r\nand orchard culture. In fact, with the exception of osier willows, and\r\ncranberries, there is scarcely a cultivated plant which will not yield\r\nlarger and better crops on drained than on undrained land,--enough better,\r\nand enough larger, to pay much more than the interest on the cost of the\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nYet, this advantage of draining, is, by no means, the only one which is\r\nworthy of consideration. Since the object of cultivation is to produce\r\nremunerative crops, of course, the larger and better the crops, the more\r\ncompletely is the object attained;--and to this extent the greatest benefit\r\nresulting from draining, lies in the increased yield. But there is another\r\nadvantage,--a material and moral advantage,--which is equally to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nInstances of the profit resulting from under-draining, (coupled, as it\r\nalmost always is, with improved cultivation,) are frequently published,\r\nand it would be easy to fortify this chapter with hundreds of well\r\nauthenticated cases. It is, however, deemed sufficient to quote the\r\nfollowing, from an old number of one of the New York dailies:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Some years ago, the son of an English farmer came to the United\r\n    States, and let himself as a farm laborer, in New York State, on\r\n    the following conditions: Commencing work at the first of\r\n    September, he was to work ten hours a day for three years, and to\r\n    receive in payment a deed of a field containing twelve\r\n    acres--securing himself by an agreement, by which his employer was\r\n    put under bonds of $2,000 to fulfill his part of the contract;\r\n    also, during these three years, he was to have the control of the\r\n    field; to work it at his own expense, and to give his employer\r\n    one-half the proceeds. The field lay under the south side of a\r\n    hill, was of dark, heavy clay resting on a bluish-colored, solid\r\n    clay subsoil, and for many years previous, had not been known to\r\n    yield anything but a yellowish, hard, stunted vegetation.\r\n\r\n    \"The farmer thought the young man was a simpleton, and that he,\r\n    himself, was most wise and fortunate; but the former, nothing\r\n    daunted by this opinion, which he was not unconscious that the\r\n    latter entertained of him, immediately hired a set of laborers,\r\n    and set them to work in the field trenching, as earnestly as it\r\n    was well possible for men to labor. In the morning and evening,\r\n    before and after having worked his ten hours, as per agreement, he\r\n    worked with them, and continued to work in this way until, about\r\n    the middle of the following November, he had finished the laying\r\n    of nearly 5,000 yards of good tile under-drains. He then had the\r\n    field plowed deep and thoroughly, and the earth thrown up as much\r\n    as possible into ridges, and thus let it remain during the winter.\r\n    Next spring he had the field again plowed as before, then\r\n    cross-plowed and thoroughly pulverized with a heavy harrow, then\r\n    sowed it with oats and clover. The yield was excellent--nothing to\r\n    be compared to it had ever before been seen upon that field. Next\r\n    year it gave two crops of clover, of a rich dark green, and\r\n    enormously heavy and luxuriant; and the year following, after\r\n    being manured at an expense of some $7 an acre, nine acres of the\r\n    field yielded 936 bushels of corn, and 25 wagon loads of pumpkins;\r\n    while from the remaining three acres were taken 100 bushels of\r\n    potatoes--the return of this crop being upwards of $1,200. The time\r\n    had now come for the field to fall into the young man's\r\n    possession, and the farmer unhesitatingly offered him $1,500 to\r\n    relinquish his title to it; and when this was unhesitatingly\r\n    refused, he offered $2,000, which was accepted.\r\n\r\n    \"The young man's account stood thus\r\n\r\n    Half proceeds of oats     $165 00\r\n    and straw, first year\r\n    Half value of sheep       25 00\r\n    pasturage, first year\r\n    Half of first crops of    112 50\r\n    clover, first year\r\n    Half of second crops of   135 00\r\n    clover, including seed,\r\n    second year\r\n    Half of sheep             15 00\r\n    pasturage, second year\r\n    Half of crops of corn,    690 00\r\n    pumpkins and potatoes,\r\n    third year\r\n    Received from farmer,     2,000 00\r\n    for relinquishment of\r\n    title\r\n                              ------\r\n    Account Dr.               $3,142 50\r\n    To under-draining,        $325 00\r\n    labor and tiles\r\n    To labor and manure,      475 00\r\n    three seasons\r\n    To labor given to         576 00--1,376 00\r\n    farmer, $16 per month,\r\n    36 months\r\n                              ------\r\n    Balance in his favor      $1,766 50\r\n\r\n\r\nDraining makes the farmer, to a great extent, the master of his vocation.\r\nWith a sloppy, drenched, cold, uncongenial soil, which is saturated with\r\nevery rain, and takes days, and even weeks, to become sufficiently dry to\r\nwork upon, his efforts are constantly baffled by unfavorable weather, at\r\nthose times when it is most important that his work proceed without\r\ninterruption. Weeks are lost, at a season when they are all too short for\r\nthe work to be done. The ground must be hurriedly, and imperfectly\r\nprepared, and the seed is put in too late, often to rot in the over-soaked\r\nsoil, requiring the field to be planted again at a time which makes it\r\nextremely doubtful whether the crop will ripen before the frost destroys\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe necessary summer cultivation, between the rows, has to be done as the\r\nweather permits; and much more of it is required because of the baking of\r\nthe ground. The whole life of the farmer, in fact, becomes a constant\r\nstruggle with nature, and he fights always at a disadvantage. What he does\r\nby the work of days, is mainly undone by a single night's storm. Weeds\r\ngrow apace, and the land is too wet to admit of their being exterminated.\r\nBy the time that it is dry enough, other pressing work occupies the time;\r\nand if, finally, a day comes when they may be attacked, they offer ten\r\ntimes the resistance that they would have done a week earlier. The\r\noperations of the farm are carried on more expensively than if the ability\r\nto work constantly allowed a smaller force to be employed. The crops which\r\ngive such doubtful promise, require the same cultivation as though they\r\nwere certain to be remunerative, and the work can be done only with\r\nincreased labor, because of the bad condition of the soil.\r\n\r\nFrom force of tradition and of habit, the farmer accepts his fate and\r\nplods through his hard life, piously ascribing to the especial\r\ninterference of an inscrutable Providence, the trials which come of his\r\nown neglect to use the means of relief which Providence has placed within\r\nhis reach.\r\n\r\nTrouble enough he must have, at any rate, but not necessarily all that he\r\nnow has. It is not within the scope of the best laid drains to control\r\nstorm or sunshine,--but it is within their power to remove the water of the\r\nstorm, rapidly and sufficiently, and to allow the heat of the sunshine to\r\npenetrate the soil and do its hidden work. No human improvement can change\r\nany of the so-called \"phenomena\" of nature, or prevent the action of the\r\nleast of her laws; but their effects upon the soil and its crops may be\r\ngreatly modified, and that which, under certain circumstances, would have\r\ncaused inconvenience or loss, may, by a change of circumstances, be made\r\npositively beneficial.\r\n\r\nIn the practice of agriculture, which is pre-eminently an economic art,\r\ndraining will be prosecuted because of the pecuniary profit which it\r\npromises, and,--very properly,--it will not be pursued, to any considerable\r\nextent, where the money, which it costs, will not bring money in return.\r\nYet, in a larger view of the case, its collateral advantages are of even\r\ngreater moment than its mere profits. It is the foundation and the\r\ncommencement of the most intelligent farming. It opens the way for other\r\nimprovements, which, without it, would produce only doubtful or temporary\r\nbenefits; and it enables the farmer so to extend and enlarge his\r\noperations, with fair promise of success, as to raise his occupation from\r\na mere waiting upon the uncertain favors of nature, to an intelligent\r\nhandling of her forces, for the attainment of almost certain results.\r\n\r\nThe rude work of an unthinking farmer, who scratches the surface soil with\r\nhis plow, plants his seed, and trusts to the chances of a greater or less\r\nreturn, is unmitigated drudgery,--unworthy of an intelligent man; but he\r\nwho investigates all of the causes of success and failure in farming, and\r\nadapts every operation to the requirements of the circumstances under\r\nwhich he works; doing everything in his power that may tend to the\r\nproduction of the results which he desires, and, so far as possible,\r\navoiding everything that may interfere with his success,--leaving nothing\r\nto chance that can be secured, and securing all that chance may offer,--is\r\nengaged in the most ennobling, the most intelligent and the most\r\nprogressive of all industrial avocations.\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of retentive soils, drainage is the key to all\r\nimprovement, and its advantage is to be measured not simply by the effect\r\nwhich it directly produces in increasing production, but, in still greater\r\ndegree, by the extent to which it prepares the way for the successful\r\napplication of improved processes, makes the farmer independent of weather\r\nand season, and offers freer scope to intelligence in the direction of his\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. - HOW TO MAKE DRAINING TILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDraining tiles are made of burnt clay, like bricks and earthen-ware.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, the process is as follows:--The clay is mixed with sand,\r\nor other substances which give it the proper consistency, and is so wetted\r\nas to form a plastic mass, to which may be given any desired form, and\r\nwhich is sufficiently stiff to retain its shape. Properly prepared clay is\r\nforced through the aperture of a die of the shape of the outside of the\r\ntile, while a plug,--held by a support in the rear of the die,--projects\r\nthrough the aperture, and gives the form to the bore of the tile. The\r\nshape of the material of the tile, as it comes from the die, corresponds\r\nto the open space, between the plug and the edge of the aperture. The clay\r\nis forced out in a continuous pipe, which is cut to the desired length by\r\na wire, which is so thin as to pass through the mass without altering the\r\nshape of the pipe. The short lengths of pipe are dried in the air as\r\nthoroughly as they can be, and are then burned in a kiln, similar to that\r\nused for pottery.\r\n\r\n*Materials.*--The range of earths which may be used in the manufacture of\r\ntiles is considerable, though clay is the basis of all of them. The best\r\nis, probably, the clay which is almost invariably found at the bottom of\r\nmuck beds, as this is finer and more compact than that which is dug from\r\ndry land, and requires but little preparation. There is, also, a peculiar\r\nclay, found in some localities, which is almost like quick-sand in its\r\nnature, and which is excellent for tile-making,--requiring no freezing, or\r\nwashing to prepare it for the machine. As a general rule, any clay which\r\nwill make _good_ bricks will make tiles. When first taken from the ground,\r\nthese clays are not usually adhesive, but become so on being moistened and\r\nkneaded.\r\n\r\nIt is especially important that no limestone _pebbles_ be mixed with the\r\nclay, as the burning would change these to quicklime, which, in slaking,\r\nwould destroy the tiles. The presence of a limey earth, however, mixed\r\nthrough the mass, is a positive advantage, as in this intimate admixture,\r\nthe lime forms, under the heat of the kiln, a chemical combination with\r\nthe other ingredients; and, as it melts more readily than some of them, it\r\nhastens the burning and makes it more complete. What is known as _plastic\r\nclay_, (one of the purest of the native clays,) is too strong for\r\ntile-making, and must be \"tempered,\" by having other substances mixed with\r\nit, to give it a stiffer quality.\r\n\r\nThe clay which is best for brick-making, contains Silica, and Alumina in\r\nabout the following proportions:\r\n\r\nSilica ... 55 to 75 per cent.\r\n\r\nAlumina ... 35 to  25 per cent.\r\n\r\nVariable quantities of other materials are usually found in connection\r\nwith the clay, in its native condition. The most common of these are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nMagnesia     1 to 5 per cent.--sometimes 20 to 30 per cent.\r\n\r\nLime         0 to 19 per cent.\r\n\r\nPotash       0 to  5 per cent.\r\n\r\nOxyd of iron 0 to 19 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"These necessary elements give fusibility to earthenware, and, therefore,\r\nallow its constituent substances to combine in such a manner as to form a\r\nresisting body; and thus is performed with a temperature lower in\r\nproportion as the necessary elements are more abundant.\"(23)\r\n\r\nWhen the earth of the locality where tiles are to be made is not\r\nsufficiently strong for the purpose, and plastic clay can be cheaply\r\nobtained from a distance, a small quantity of this may be used to give\r\nstrength and tenacity to the native material.\r\n\r\nThe compound must always contain a proper proportion of clay and sand. If\r\ntoo little _clay_ is used, the mass will not be sufficiently tough to\r\nretain its compactness as it passes through the die of the tile machine;\r\nif too little _sand_, the moulded tiles will not be strong enough to bear\r\nhandling, and they will crack and warp in drying and burning. Within the\r\nproper limits, the richer earths may be moulded much thinner, and tiles\r\nmade from them may, consequently, be made lighter for transportation,\r\nwithout being too weak. The best materials for tempering stiff clays are\r\nsand, pounded brick or tile, or _scoria_, from smelting furnaces.\r\n\r\n*Preparation Of Earths.*--The clay from which tiles are to be made, should\r\nbe thrown out in the fall, (the upper and lower parts of the beds being\r\nwell mixed in the operation,) and made into heaps on the surface, not more\r\nthan about 3 feet square and 3 feet high. In this form, it is left exposed\r\nto the freezing and thawing of winter, which will aid very much in\r\nmodifying its character,--making it less lumpy and more easily workable.\r\nAny stones which may appear in the digging, should, of course, be removed,\r\nand most earths will be improved by being passed through a pair of heavy\r\niron rollers, before they are piled up for the winter. The rollers should\r\nbe made of cast iron, about 15 inches in diameter, and 30 inches long, and\r\nset as close together as they can be, and still be revolved by the power\r\nof two horses. The grinding, by means of these rollers, may add 50 cents\r\nper thousand to the cost of the tiles, but it will greatly improve their\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, the clay should be prepared for tempering, by the removal\r\nof such pebbles as it may still contain. The best way to do this is by\r\n\"washing,\" though, if there be only a few coarse pebbles, they may be\r\nremoved by building the clay into a solid cone 2 or 3 feet high, and then\r\nparing it off into thin slices with a long knife having a handle at each\r\nend. This paring will discover any pebbles larger than a pea that may have\r\nremained in the clay.\r\n\r\n_Washing_ is the process of mixing the clay with a considerable quantity\r\nof water, so as to form a thin paste, in which all stones and gravel will\r\nsink to the bottom; the liquid portion is then drawn off into shallow pits\r\nor vats, and allowed to settle, the clear water being finally removed by\r\npumping or by evaporation, according to the need for haste. For washing\r\nsmall quantities of clay, a common mortar bed, such as is used by masons,\r\nwill answer, if it be supplied with a gate for draining off the muddy\r\nwater after the gravel has settled; but, if the work is at all extensive,\r\na washing mill will be required. It may be made in the form of a circular\r\ntrough, with scrapers for mixing the clay and water attached to a circular\r\nhorse-sweep.\r\n\r\n\"Another convenient mixing machine may be constructed in the following\r\nmanner: Take a large hollow log, of suitable length, say five or six feet;\r\nhew out the inequalities with an adz, and close up the ends with pieces of\r\nstrong plank, into which bearing have been cut to support a revolving\r\nshaft. This shaft should be sufficiently thick to permit being transfixed\r\nwith wooden pins long enough to reach within an inch or two of the sides\r\nof the log or trough, and they should be so beveled as to form in their\r\naggregate shape an interrupted screw, having a direction toward that end\r\nof the box where the mixed clay is designed to pass out. In order to\r\neffect the mixing more thoroughly, these pins may be placed sufficiently\r\nfar apart to permit the interior of the box to be armed with other pins\r\nextending toward the center, between which they can easily move. The whole\r\nis placed either horizontally or vertically, and supplied with clay and\r\nwater in proper quantities, while the shaft is made to revolve by means of\r\na sweep, with horse power, running water or steam, as the case may be. The\r\nclay is put into the end farthest from the outlet, and is carried forward\r\nto it and mixed by the motion, and mutual action and re-action of the pins\r\nin the shaft and in the sides of the box. Iron pins may, of course, be\r\nsubstituted for the wooden ones, and have the advantage of greater\r\ndurability and of greater strength in proportion to their size, and the\r\nnumber may therefore be greater in a machine of any given length. The\r\nfluid mass of clay and water may be permitted to fall upon a sieve or\r\nriddle, of heavy wire, and afterward be received in a settling vat, of\r\nsuitable size and construction, to drain off the water and let the clay\r\ndry out sufficiently by subsequent evaporation. A machine of this\r\nconstruction may be made of such a size that it may be put in motion by\r\nhand, by means of a crank, and yet be capable of mixing, if properly\r\nsupplied, clay enough to mold 800 or 1000 pieces of drain pipe per\r\nday.\"(24)\r\n\r\nMr. Parkes, in a report to the Royal Agricultural Society of England, in\r\n1843, says:\r\n\r\n\"It is requisite that the clay be well washed and sieved before pugging,\r\nfor the manufacture of these tiles, or the operation of drawing them would\r\nbe greatly impeded, by having to remove stones from the small space\r\nsurrounding the die, which determines the thickness of the pipe. But it\r\nresults from this necessary washing, that the substance of the pipe is\r\nuniformly and extremely dense, which, consequently, gives it immense\r\nstrength, and ensures a durability which cannot belong to a more porous,\r\nthough thicker, tile.\r\n\r\n\"The clay is brought from the pug-mill so dry that, when squeezed through\r\nthe machine, not a drop of water exudes,--moisture is, indeed, scarcely\r\napparent on the surface of the raw pipe. Hence, the tiles undergo little\r\nor no change of figure while drying, which takes place very rapidly,\r\nbecause of their firm and slight substance.\"\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Fig. 42 - PUG-MILL.]\r\n\r\n                             Fig. 42 - PUG-MILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tempering._--After the fine clay is relieved of the water with which it\r\nwas washed, and has become tolerably dry, it should be mixed with the\r\nsand, or other tempering material, and passed through the _Pug-Mill_,\r\n(Fig. 42,) which will thoroughly mix its various ingredients, and work the\r\nwhole into a homogeneous mass, ready for the tile machine. The _pug-mill_\r\nis similar to that used in brick-yards, only, as the clay is worked much\r\nstiffer for tiles than for bricks, iron knives must be substituted for the\r\nwooden pins. These knives are so arranged as to cut the clay in every\r\npart, and, by being set at an angle, they force it downward toward the\r\noutlet gate at the bottom. The clay should be kept at the proper degree of\r\nmoisture from the time of tempering, and after passing through the\r\npug-mill it should be thoroughly beaten to drive out the air, and the\r\nbeaten mass should be kept covered with wet cloths to prevent drying.\r\n\r\n*Moulding the Tiles.*--Machines for moulding tiles are of various styles,\r\nwith much variation in the details of their construction, but they all act\r\non the same general principle;--that of forcing the clay through a\r\nring-shaped aperture in an iron plate, forming a continuous pipe, which is\r\ncarried off on an endless apron, or on rollers, and cut by wires into the\r\ndesired lengths. The plates with the ring-shaped apertures are called\r\n_dies_; the openings are of any desired form, corresponding to the\r\nexternal shape of the tiles; and the size and shape of the bore, is\r\ndetermined by the core or plug, which is held in the centers of the\r\napertures. The construction of the die plates, and the manner of fastening\r\nthe plugs, which determine the bore of the tiles, is shown in Fig. 43. The\r\nview taken is of the inside of the plate.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Fig. 43 - PLATE OF DIES.]\r\n\r\n                           Fig. 43 - PLATE OF DIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machine consists usually of a strong iron chest, with a hinged cover,\r\ninto which the clay is placed, having a piston moving in it, connected by\r\na rod or bar, having cog-teeth, with a cog-wheel, which is moved by horse\r\nor hand power, and drives the piston forward with steadiness, forcing the\r\nclay through the openings in the die-plate. The clay issues in continuous\r\nlines of pipe. The machines most in use in this country are connected\r\ndirectly with the pug-mill, and as the clay is pugged, it at once passes\r\ninto the box, and is pressed out as tiles. These machines are usually run\r\nby horse-power.\r\n\r\nMr. Barral, in his voluminous work on drainage,(25) describes, as follows,\r\na cheap hand machine which can be made by any country wheelwright, and\r\nwhich has a capacity of 3,000 tiles per day (Fig. 44):\r\n\r\n\"Imagine a simple, wooden box, divided into two compartments. In the rear\r\ncompartment there stands a vertical post, fastened with two iron bolts,\r\nhaving heads at one end, and nuts and screws at the other. The box is thus\r\nfixed to its support. We simply place this support on the ground and bind\r\nits upper part with a rope to a tree, a stake, or a post. The front\r\ncompartment is the reservoir for the clay, presenting at its front an\r\norifice, in which we fix the desired die with a simple bolt. A wooden\r\npiston, of which the rod is jointed with a lever, which works in a bolt at\r\nthe top of the supporting post, gives the necessary pressure. When the\r\nchest is full of clay, we bear down on the end of the lever, and the\r\nmoulded tiles run out on a table supplied with rollers. Raising the\r\npiston, it comes out of the box, which is again packed with clay. The\r\npiston is replaced in the box; pressure is again applied to the lever, and\r\nso on. When the line of tiles reaches the end of the table, we lower a\r\nframe on which brass wires are stretched, and cut it into the usual\r\nlengths.\"\r\n\r\n                    [Fig. 44 - CHEAP WOODEN MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n                     Fig. 44 - CHEAP WOODEN MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workmen must attend well to the degree of moisture of the clay which\r\nis put into the machine. It should be dry enough to show no undue moisture\r\non its surface as it comes out of the die-plate, and sufficiently moist\r\nnot to be crumbled in passing the edge of the mould. The clay for small\r\n(thin) tiles must, necessarily, be more moist than that which is to pass\r\nthrough a wider aperture; and for the latter there may, with advantage, be\r\nmore sand in the paste than would be practicable with the former.\r\n\r\nAfter the tiles are cut into lengths, they are removed by a set of\r\nmandrils, small enough to pass easily into them, such as are shown in Fig.\r\n45, (the number of fingers corresponding with  the number of rows of tiles\r\nmade by the machine,) and are placed on shelves made of narrow strips sawn\r\nfrom one-inch boards, laid with spaces between them to allow a free\r\ncirculation of air.\r\n\r\n         [Fig. 45 - MANDRIL FOR CARRYING TILES FROM MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n          Fig. 45 - MANDRIL FOR CARRYING TILES FROM MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Drying and Rolling.*--Care must be taken that freshly made tiles be not\r\ndried too rapidly. They should be sheltered from the sun and from strong\r\nwinds. Too rapid drying has the effect of warping them out of shape, and,\r\nsometimes, of cracking the clay. To provide against this injury, the\r\ndrying is done under sheds or other covering, and the side which is\r\nexposed to the prevailing winds is sometimes boarded up.\r\n\r\nFor the first drying, the tiles are placed in single layers on the\r\nshelves. When about half dried,--at which time they are usually warped more\r\nor less from their true shape,--it is well to _roll_ them. This is done by\r\npassing through them a smooth, round stick, (sufficiently smaller than the\r\nbore to enter it easily, and long enough to project five or six inches\r\nbeyond each end of the tile,) and,--holding one end of the stick in each\r\nhand,--rolling them carefully on a table. This operation should be\r\nperformed when the tiles are still moist enough not to be broken by the\r\nslight bending required to make them straight. After rolling, the tiles\r\nmay be piled up in close layers, some four or five feet high, (which will\r\nsecure them against further warping,) and left until they are dry enough\r\nfor burning,--that is, as dry as they can be made by exposure to the air.\r\n\r\n*Burning.*--Tiles are burned in kilns in which, by the effect of flame\r\nacting directly upon them, they are raised to a heat sufficient to melt\r\nsome of their more easily fusible ingredients, and give to them a\r\nstone-like hardness.\r\n\r\nKilns are of various construction and of various sizes. As this book is\r\nnot intended for the instruction of those who are engaged in the general\r\nmanufacture of tiles, only for those who may find it necessary to\r\nestablish local works, it will be sufficient to describe a temporary\r\nearthen kiln which may be cheaply built, and which will answer an\r\nexcellent purpose, where only 100,000 or 200,000 tiles per season will be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nDirections for its construction are set forth in a letter from Mr. T. Law\r\nHodges, of England, to the late Earl Spencer, published in the Journal of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society for the year 1843, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The form of the clay-kiln is circular, 11 feet in diameter, and 7 feet\r\nhigh. It is wholly built of damp, clayey earth, rammed firmly together,\r\nand plastered, inside and out, with loam (clay?). The earth to form the\r\nwalls is dug out around the base, leaving a circular trench about four\r\nfeet wide and as many deep, into which the fire-holes of the kiln open. If\r\nwood be the fuel used, three fire-holes will be sufficient; if coal, four\r\nwill be needed. About 1,200 common brick will be wanted to build these\r\nfire-holes and flues; if coal is used, rather fewer bricks will be wanted,\r\nbut, then, some iron bars are necessary,--six bars to each fire-hole.\r\n\r\n\"The earthen walls are four feet thick at the floor of the kiln, seven\r\nfeet high, and tapering to a thickness of two feet at the top; this will\r\ndetermine the slope of the exterior face of the kiln. The inside of the\r\nwall is carried up perpendicularly, and the loam plastering inside\r\nbecomes, after the first burning, like a brick wall. The kiln may be\r\nsafely erected in March, or whenever the danger of injury from frost is\r\nover. After the summer use of it, it must be protected, by faggots or\r\nlitter, against the wet and frost of winter. A kiln of these dimensions\r\nwill contain 32,500 1-1/4-inch tiles, * * * or 12,000 2-1/4-inch tiles. *\r\n* *\r\n\r\n\"In good weather, this kiln can be filled, burnt, and discharged once in\r\nevery fortnight, and fifteen kilns may be obtained in a good season,\r\nproducing 487,500 1-1/4-inch tiles, and in proportion for the other sizes.\r\n\r\n\"It requires 2 tons 5 cwt. of good coals to burn the above kiln, full of\r\ntiles.\"\r\n\r\n                          [Fig. 46 - CLAY-KILN.]\r\n\r\n                           Fig. 46 - CLAY-KILN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sectional view of this kiln is shown in Fig. 46, in which _C, C_\r\nrepresent sections of the outer trench; _A_, one of the three fire-holes;\r\nand _B, B_, sections of a circular passage inside of the wall, connected\r\nwith the fire-holes, and serving as a flue for the flames, which, at\r\nsuitable intervals, pass through openings into the floor of the kiln. The\r\nwhole structure should be covered with a roof of rough boards, placed high\r\nenough to be out of the reach of the fire. A door in the side of the kiln\r\nserves for putting in and removing the tiles, and is built up,\r\ntemporarily, with bricks or clay, during the burning. Mr. Hodges estimates\r\nthe cost of this kiln, all complete, at less than $25. Concerning its\r\nvalue, he wrote another letter in 1848, from which the following is\r\nextracted:\r\n\r\n\"The experience of four years that have elapsed since my letter to the\r\nlate Earl Spencer, published in the 5th volume of the proceedings of the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society, page 57, has thoroughly tested the merits of\r\nthe temporary clay-kilns for the burning of draining-pipes described in\r\nthat letter.\r\n\r\n\"I am well aware that there were persons, even among those who came to see\r\nit, who pronounced at once upon the construction and duration of the kiln\r\nas unworthy of attention. How far their expectations have been realized,\r\nand what value belongs to their judgment, the following short statement\r\nwill exhibit:\r\n\r\n\"The kiln, in question, was constructed, in 1844, at a cost of L5.\r\n\r\n\"It was used four times in that year, burning each time between 18,000 and\r\n19,000 draining pipes, of 1-3/4 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"In 1845, it was used nine times, or about once a fortnight, burning each\r\ntime the same quantity of nearly 19,000 pipes.\r\n\r\n\"In 1846, the same result.\r\n\r\n\"In 1847, it has been used twelve times, always burning the same quantity.\r\nIn the course of the last year a trifling repair in the bottom of the\r\nkiln, costing rather less than 10 shillings, was necessary, and this is\r\nthe only cost for repair since its erection. It is now as good as ever,\r\nand might be worked at least once a fortnight through the ensuing season.\r\n\r\n\"The result of this experiment of four years shows not only the practical\r\nvalue of this cheap kiln, but Mr. Hatcher, who superintends the brick and\r\ntile-yard at Benenden, where this kiln stands, expresses himself strongly\r\nin favor of this kiln, as always producing better and more evenly burned\r\npipes than either of his larger and better built brick-kilns can do.\"\r\n\r\nThe floor of the kiln is first covered with bricks, placed on end, at a\r\nlittle distance from each other, so as to allow the fire to pass between\r\nthem, and the tiles are placed _on end_ on these. This position will\r\nafford the best draft for the flames. After the kiln is packed full, the\r\ndoor-way is built up, and a slow fire is started,--only enough at first to\r\ncomplete the drying of the tiles, and to do this so slowly as not to warp\r\nthem out of shape. They will be thoroughly dry when the smoke from the top\r\nof the kiln loses its dark color and becomes transparent. When the fires\r\nare well started, the mouths of the fire-holes may be built up so as to\r\nleave only sufficient room to put in fresh fuel, and if the wind is high,\r\nthe fire-holes, on the side against which it blows, should be sheltered by\r\nsome sort of screen which will counteract its influence, and keep up an\r\neven heat on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe time required for burning will be from two days and a night to four\r\ndays and four nights, according to the dryness of the tiles, the state of\r\nthe weather, and the character of the fuel. The fires should be drawn when\r\nthe tiles in the hottest part of the kiln are burned to a \"ringing\"\r\nhardness. By leaving two or three holes in the door-way, which can be\r\nstopped with loose brick, a rod may be run in, from time to time, to take\r\nout specimen tiles from the hottest part of the kiln, which shall have\r\nbeen so placed as to be easily removed. The best plan, however,--the only\r\nprudent plan, in fact,--will be to employ an intelligent man who is\r\nthoroughly experienced in the burning of brick and pottery, and whose\r\njudgment in the management of the fires, and in the cooling off of the\r\nkiln, will save much of the waste that would result from inexperienced\r\nmanagement. After the burning is completed, from 40 to 60 hours must be\r\nallowed for the cooling of the kiln before it is opened. If the cold air\r\nis admitted while it is still very hot, the unequal contraction of the\r\nmaterial will cause the tiles to crack, and a large portion of them may be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIf any of the tiles are too much burned, they will be melted, and may\r\nstick together, or, at least, have their shape destroyed. Those which are\r\nnot sufficiently burned would not withstand the action of the water in the\r\nsoil, and should not be used. For the first of these accidents there is no\r\nremedy; for the latter, reburning will be necessary, and under-done tiles\r\nmay be left, (or replaced,) in the kiln in the position which they\r\noccupied at the first burning, and the second heat will probably prove\r\nsufficient. There is less danger of unequal burning in circular than in\r\nsquare kilns. Soft wood is better than hard, as making a better flame. It\r\nshould be split fine, and well seasoned.\r\n\r\n*Arrangement of the Tilery.*--Such a tilery as is described above should\r\nhave a drying shed from 60 to 80 feet long, and from 12 to 18 feet wide.\r\nThis shed may be built in the cheapest and roughest manner, the roof being\r\ncovered with felting, thatch, or hemlock boards, as economy may suggest.\r\nIt should have a tier of drying shelves, (made of slats rather than of\r\nboards,) running the whole length of each side. A narrow, wooden tram-way,\r\ndown the middle, to carry a car, by which the green tiles may be taken\r\nfrom the machine to the shelves, and the dry ones from the shelves to the\r\nkiln, will greatly lessen the cost of handling.\r\n\r\nThe pug-mill and tile-machine, as well as the clay pit and the\r\nwashing-mill, should be at one end of the shed, and the kiln at the other,\r\nso that, even in rainy weather, the work may proceed without interruption.\r\nA shed of the size named will be sufficient to dry as many tiles of\r\nassorted sizes as can be burned in the clay-kiln described above.\r\n\r\n*The Cost of Tiles.*--It would be impossible, at any time, to say what\r\nshould be the precise cost of tiles in a given locality, without knowing\r\nthe prices of labor and fuel; and in the present unsettled condition of\r\nthe currency, any estimate would necessarily be of little value. Mr.\r\nParker's estimated the cost of inch pipes in England at 6_s._, (about\r\n$1.50,) per thousand, when made on the estate where they were to be used,\r\nby a process similar to that described herein. Probably they could at no\r\ntime have been made for less than twice that cost in the United\r\nStates,--and they would now cost much more; though if the clay is dug out\r\nin the fall, when the regularly employed farm hands are short of work, and\r\nif the same men can cut and haul the wood during the winter, the hands\r\nhired especially for the tile making, during the summer season, (two men\r\nand two or three boys,) cannot, even at present rates of wages, bring the\r\ncost of the tiles to nearly the market prices. If there be only temporary\r\nuse for the machinery, it may be sold, when no longer needed, for a good\r\npercentage of its original cost, as, from the slow movement to which it is\r\nsubjected, it is not much worn by its work.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why tiles should cost more to make than bricks. A\r\ncommon brick contains clay enough to make four or five 1-1/4-inch tiles,\r\nand it will require about the same amount of fuel to burn this clay in one\r\nform as in the other. This advantage in favor of tiles is in a measure\r\noffset by the greater cost of handling them, and the greater liability to\r\nbreakage.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description of the different processes of the manufacture of\r\ndraining tiles has been given, in order that those who find it necessary,\r\nor desirable, to establish works to supply the needs of their immediate\r\nlocalities may commence their operations understandingly, and form an\r\napproximate opinion of the promise of success in the undertaking.\r\n\r\nProbably the most positive effect of the foregoing description, on the\r\nmind of any man who contemplates establishing a tilery, will be to cause\r\nhim to visit some successful manufactory, during the busy season, and\r\nexamine for himself the mode of operation. Certainly it would be unwise,\r\nwhen such a personal examination of the process is practicable, to rely\r\nentirely upon the aid of written descriptions; for, in any work like\r\ntile-making, where the selection, combination and preparation of the\r\nmaterials, the means of drying, and the economy and success of the burning\r\nmust depend on a variety of conditions and circumstances, which change\r\nwith every change of locality, it is impossible that written directions,\r\nhowever minute, should be a sufficient guide. Still, in the light of such\r\ndirections, one can form a much better idea of the bearing of the\r\ndifferent operations which he may witness, than he could possibly do if\r\nthe whole process were new to him.\r\n\r\nIf a personal examination of a successful tilery is impracticable, it will\r\nbe necessary to employ a practical brick-maker, or potter, to direct the\r\nconstruction and operation of the works, and in any case, this course is\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nIn any neighborhood where two or three hundred acres of land are to be\r\ndrained, if suitable earths can be readily obtained, it will be cheaper to\r\nestablish a tile-yard, than to haul the necessary tiles, in wagons, a\r\ndistance of ten or twenty miles. Then again, the prices demanded by the\r\nfew manufacturers, who now have almost a monopoly of the business, are\r\nexorbitantly high,--at least twice what it will cost to make the tiles at\r\nhome, with the cheap works described above, so that if the cost of\r\ntransportation on the quantity desired would be equal to the cost of\r\nestablishing the works, there will be a decided profit in the home\r\nmanufacture. Probably, also, a tile-yard, in a neighborhood where the\r\ngeneral character of the soil is such as to require drainage, will be of\r\nvalue after the object for which it was made has been accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhile setting forth the advantage to the farmer of everything which may\r\nprotect him against monopolies, whether in the matter of draining-tile, or\r\nof any other needful accessory of his business, or which will enable him\r\nto procure supplies without a ruinous outlay for transportation, it is by\r\nno means intended that every man shall become his own tile-maker.\r\n\r\nIn this branch of manufacture, as in every other, organized industry will\r\naccomplish results to which individual labor can never attain. A hundred\r\nyears ago, when our mill-made cloths came from England, and cost more than\r\nfarmers could afford to pay, they wore home-spun, which was neither so\r\nhandsome nor so good as the imported article; but, since that time, the\r\ngrowing population and the greater demand have caused cloth mills to be\r\nbuilt here, greater commercial facilities have placed foreign goods within\r\neasy reach, and the house loom has fallen into general disuse.\r\n\r\nAt present, the manufacture of draining tiles is confined to a few, widely\r\nseparated localities, and each manufacturer has, thus far, been able to\r\nfix his own scale of charges. These, and the cost of transportation to\r\ndistant points, make it difficult, if not impossible, for many farmers to\r\nprocure tiles at a cost low enough to justify their use. In such cases,\r\nsmall works, to supply local demand, may enable many persons to drain with\r\ntiles, who, otherwise, would find it impossible to procure them cheaply\r\nenough for economical use; and the extension of under-draining, causing a\r\nmore general acquaintance with its advantages, would create a sufficient\r\ndemand to induce an increase of the manufacture of tiles, and a consequent\r\nreduction of price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. - THE RECLAIMING OF SALT MARSHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Adjoining to it is Middle Moor, containing about 2,500 acres,\r\n    spoken of by Arthur Young as 'a watery desert,' growing sedge and\r\n    rushes, and inhabited by frogs and bitterns;--it is now fertile,\r\n    well cultivated, and profitable land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing extract, from an account of the Drainage of the Fens on the\r\neastern coast of England, is a text from which might be preached a sermon\r\nworthy of the attention of all who are interested in the vast areas of\r\nsalt marsh which form so large a part of our Atlantic coast, from Maine to\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of acres that might be cheaply reclaimed, and made\r\nour most valuable and most salubrious lands, are abandoned to the inroads\r\nof the sea;--fruitful only in malaria and musquitoes,--always a dreary\r\nwaste, and often a grave annoyance.\r\n\r\nA single tract, over 20,000 acres in extent, the center of which is not\r\nseven miles from the heart of New York City, skirts the Hackensack River,\r\nin New Jersey, serving as a barrier to intercourse between the town and\r\nthe country which lies beyond it, adding miles to the daily travel of the\r\nthousands whose business and pleasure require them to cross it, and\r\nconstituting a nuisance and an eyesore to all who see it, or come near it.\r\nHow long it will continue in this condition it is impossible to say, but\r\nthe experience of other countries has proved that, for an expense of not\r\nmore than fifty dollars per acre, this tract might be made better, for all\r\npurposes of cultivation, than the lands adjoining it, (many of which are\r\nworth, for market gardening, over one thousand dollars per acre,) and that\r\nit might afford profitable employment, and give homes, to all of the\r\nindustrious poor of the city. The work of reclaiming it would be child's\r\nplay, compared with the draining of the Harlaem Lake in Holland, where\r\nover 40,000 acres, submerged to an average depth of thirteen feet, have\r\nbeen pumped dry, and made to do their part toward the support of a dense\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe Hackensack meadows are only a conspicuous example of what exists over\r\na great extent of our whole seaboard;--virgin lands, replete with every\r\nelement of fertility, capable of producing enough food for the support of\r\nmillions of human beings, better located, for residence and for\r\nconvenience to markets, than the prairies of the Western States,--all\r\nallowed to remain worse than useless; while the poorer uplands near them\r\nare, in many places, teeming with a population whose lives are endangered,\r\nand whose comfort is sadly interfered with by the insects and the miasma\r\nwhich the marsh produces.\r\n\r\nThe inherent wealth of the land is locked up, and all of its bad effects\r\nare produced, by the water with which it is constantly soaked or\r\noverflowed. Let the waters of the sea be excluded, and a proper outlet for\r\nthe rain-fall and the upland wash be provided,--both of which objects may,\r\nin a great majority of cases, be economically accomplished,--and this land\r\nmay become the garden of the continent. Its fertility will attract a\r\npopulation, (especially in the vicinity of large towns,) which could no\r\nwhere else live so well nor so easily.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these salt marshes were formed may be understood from\r\nthe following account of the \"Great Level of the Fens\" of the eastern\r\ncoast of England, which is copied, (as is the paragraph at the head of\r\nthis chapter,) from the Prize Essay of Mr. John Algernon Clarke, written\r\nfor the Royal Agricultural Society in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe process is not, of course, always the same, nor are the exact\r\ninfluences, which made the English Fens, generally, operating in precisely\r\nthe same manner here, but the main principle is the same, and the lesson\r\ntaught by the improvement of the Fens is perfectly applicable in our case.\r\n\r\n\"This great level extends itself into the six counties of Cambridge,\r\nLincoln, Huntington, Northampton, Suffolk and Norfolk, being bounded by\r\nthe highlands of each. It is about seventy miles in length, and varies\r\nfrom twenty to forty miles in breadth, having an area of more than 680,000\r\nacres. Through this vast extent of flat country, there flow six large\r\nrivers, with their tributary streams; namely, the Ouse, the Cam, the Nene,\r\nthe Welland, the Glen, and the Witham.\r\n\r\n\"These were, originally, natural channels for conveying the upland waters\r\nto the sea, and whenever a heavier downfall of rain than usual occurred,\r\nand the swollen springs and rivulets caused the rivers to overflow, they\r\nmust necessarily have overflowed the land to a great extent.\r\n\r\n\"This, however, was not the principal cause of the inundation of the Fens:\r\nthese rivers were not allowed a free passage to the ocean, being thus made\r\nincapable of carrying off even the ordinary amount of upland water which,\r\nconsequently, flowed over the land. The obstruction was two-fold; first,\r\nthe outfalls became blocked up by the deposits of silt from the sea\r\nwaters, which accumulated to an amazing thickness. The well known\r\ninstances of boats found in 1635 eight feet below the Wisbeck River, and\r\nthe smith's forge and tools found at Skirbeck Shoals, near Boston, buried\r\nwith silt sixteen feet deep, show what an astonishing quantity of sediment\r\nformerly choked up the mouths of these great rivers. But the chief\r\nhindrance caused by the ocean, arose from the tide rushing twice every day\r\nfor a very great distance up these channels, driving back the fresh\r\nwaters, and overflowing with them, so that the whole level became deluged\r\nwith deep water, and was, in fact, one great bay.\r\n\r\n\"In considering the state of this region as it first attracted the\r\nenterprise of man to its improvement, we are to conceive a vast, wild\r\nmorass, with only small, detached portions of cultivated soil, or islands,\r\nraised above the general inundation; a most desolate picture when\r\ncontrasted with its present state of matchless fertility.\"\r\n\r\nSalt marshes are formed of the silty deposits of rivers and of the sea.\r\nThe former bring down vegetable mould and fine earth from the uplands, and\r\nthe latter contribute sea weeds and grasses, sand and shells, and millions\r\nof animalculae which, born for life in salt water only, die, and are\r\ndeposited with the other matters, at those points where, from admixture\r\nwith the fresh flow of the rivers, the water ceases to be suitable for\r\ntheir support. It is estimated that these animalculae alone are the chief\r\ncause of the obstructions at the mouths of the rivers of Holland, which\r\nretard their flow, and cause them to spread over the flat country\r\nadjoining their banks. It is less important, however, for the purposes of\r\nthis chapter, to consider the manner in which salt marshes are formed,\r\nthan to discuss the means by which they may be reclaimed and made\r\navailable for the uses of agriculture. The improvement may be conveniently\r\nconsidered under three heads:--\r\n\r\nFirst--The exclusion of the sea water.\r\n\r\nSecond--The removal of the causes of inundation from the upland.\r\n\r\nThird--The removal of the rain-fall and water of filtration.\r\n\r\n*The Exclusion of the Sea* is of the first importance, because not only\r\ndoes it saturate the land with water,--but this water, being salt, renders\r\nit unfertile for the plants of ordinary cultivation, and causes it to\r\nproduce others which are of little, or no value.\r\n\r\nThe only means by which the sea may be kept out is, by building such dykes\r\nor embankments as shut out the highest tides, and, on shores which are\r\nexposed to the action of the waves, will resist their force. Ordinarily,\r\nthe best, because the cheapest, material of which these embankments can be\r\nmade, is the soil of the marsh itself. This is rarely,--almost never,--a\r\npure peat, such as is found in upland swamps; it contains a large\r\nproportion of sand, blue clay, muscle mud, or other earthy deposits, which\r\ngive it great weight and tenacity, and render it excellent for forming the\r\nbody of the dyke. On lands which are overflowed to a considerable extent\r\nat each high tide, (twice a day,) it will be necessary to adopt more\r\nexpensive, and more effective measures, but on ordinary salt meadows,\r\nwhich are deeply covered only at the spring tides, (occurring every\r\nmonth,) the following plan will be found practical and economical.\r\n\r\n_Locating the line of the embankment_ far enough back from the edge of the\r\nmeadow to leave an ample flat outside of it to break the force of the\r\nwaves, if on the open coast, or to resist the inroads of the current if on\r\nthe bank of an estuary or a river,--say from ten to one hundred yards,\r\naccording to the danger of encroachment,--set a row of stakes parallel to\r\nthe general direction of the shore, to mark the outside line of the base\r\nof the dyke. Stake out the inside line at such distance as will give a\r\npitch or inclination to the slopes of one and a half to one on the\r\noutside, and of one to one on the inside, and will allow the necessary\r\nwidth at the top, which should be at least two feet higher than the level\r\nof the highest tide that is known ever to have occurred at that place. The\r\nwidth of the top should never be less than four feet, and in exposed\r\nlocalities it should be more. If a road will be needed around the land, it\r\nis best, if a heavy dyke is required, to make it wide enough to answer\r\nthis purpose, with still wider places, at intervals, to allow vehicles to\r\nturn or to pass each other. Ordinarily, however, especially if there be a\r\ngood stretch of flat meadow in front, the top of the dyke need not be more\r\nthan four feet wide. Supposing such a dyke to be contemplated where the\r\nwater has been known to rise two feet above the level of the meadows,\r\nrequiring an embankment four feet high, it will be necessary to allow for\r\nthe base a width of fourteen feet;--four feet for the width of the top, six\r\nfeet for the reach of the front slope, (1-1/2 to 1,) and four feet for the\r\nreach of the back slope, (1 to 1.)\r\n\r\nHaving staked out two parallel lines, fourteen feet apart, and erected, at\r\nintervals of twenty or thirty feet, frames made of rough strips of board\r\nof the exact shape of the section of the proposed embankment, the workmen\r\nmay remove the sod to a depth of six inches, laying it all on the outside\r\nof the position of the proposed embankment. The sod from the line of the\r\nditch, from which the earth for the embankment is to be taken, should also\r\nbe removed and placed with the other. This ditch should be always _inside_\r\nof the dyke, where it will never be exposed to the action of the sea. It\r\nshould be, at the surface, broader than the base of the dyke, and five\r\nfeet deep in the center, but its sides may slope from the surface of the\r\nground directly to the center line of the bottom. This is the best form to\r\ngive it, because, while it should be five feet deep, for future uses as a\r\ndrain, its bottom need have no width. The great width at the surface will\r\ngive such a pitch to the banks as to ensure their stability, and will\r\nyield a large amount of sod for the facing of the dyke. The edge of this\r\nditch should be some feet away from the inner line of the embankment,\r\nleaving it a firm support or shoulder at the original level of the ground,\r\nthe sod not being removed from the interval. The next step in the work\r\nshould be to throw, or wheel, the material from the ditch on to the place\r\nwhich has been stripped for the dyke, building it up so as to conform\r\nexactly to the profile frames, these remaining in their places, to\r\nindicate the filling necessary to make up for the settling of the\r\nmaterial, as the water drains out of it.\r\n\r\n                       [Fig. 47 - DYKE AND DITCH.]\r\n\r\n                        Fig. 47 - DYKE AND DITCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs fast as a permanent shape can be given to the outer face of the dyke,\r\nit should be finished by having the sod placed against it, being laid\r\nflatwise, one on top of another, (like stone work,) in the most solid\r\nmanner possible. This should be continued to the top of the slope, and the\r\nflat top of the dyke should also be sodded,--the sods on the top, and on\r\nthe slope, being firmly beaten to their places with the back of the spade\r\nor other suitable implement. This will sufficiently protect the exposed\r\nparts of the work against the action of any waves that may be formed on\r\nthe flat between the dyke and the deep water, while the inner slope and\r\nthe banks of the ditch, not being exposed to masses of moving water, will\r\nretain their shape and will soon be covered with a new growth.(26) A\r\nsectional view of the above described dyke and ditch is shown in the\r\naccompanying diagram, (Fig. 47.)\r\n\r\nIn all work of this character, it is important to regulate the amount of\r\nwork laid out to be done between the spring tides, to the laboring force\r\nemployed, so that no unfinished work will remain to be submerged and\r\ninjured. When the flood comes, it should find everything finished up and\r\nprotected against its ravages, so that no part of it need be done over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIf the land is crossed by creeks, the dyke should be finished off and\r\nsodded, a little back from each bank, and when the time comes for closing\r\nthe channel, sufficient force should be employed to complete the dam at a\r\nsingle tide, so that the returning flow shall not enter to wash away the\r\nmaterial which has been thrown in.\r\n\r\nIf, as is often the case, these creeks are not merely tidal estuaries, but\r\nreceive brooks or rivers from the upland, provision must be made, as will\r\nbe hereafter directed, for either diverting the upland flow, or for\r\nallowing it to pass out at low water, through valve gates or sluices. When\r\nthe dam has been made, the water behind it should never be allowed to rise\r\nto nearly the level of the full tide, and, as soon as possible, grass and\r\nwillows should be grown on the bank, to add to its strength by the binding\r\neffect of their roots.\r\n\r\nWhen the dyke is completed across the front of the whole flat,--from the\r\nhigh land on one side to the high land on the other, the creeks should be\r\nclosed, one after the other, commencing with the smallest, so that the\r\nexperience gained in their treatment may enable the force to work more\r\nadvantageously on those which carry more water.\r\n\r\nIf the flow of water in the creek is considerable, a row of strong stakes,\r\nor piles, should be firmly driven into the bottom mud, across the whole\r\nwidth of the channel, at intervals of not more than one or two feet, and\r\n_fascines_,--bundles of brush bound together,--should be made ready on the\r\nbanks, in sufficient quantity to close the spaces between the piles. These\r\nwill serve to prevent the washing away of the filling during construction.\r\nThe pile driving, and the preparation of the fascines may be done before\r\nthe closing of the channel with earth is commenced, and if upland clay or\r\ngravel, to be mixed with the local material, can be economically brought\r\nto the place by boats or wagons, it will be an advantage. Everything being\r\nin readiness, a sufficient force of laborers to finish the dam in six\r\nhours should commence the work a little before dead low-water, and, (with\r\nthe aid of wheelbarrows, if necessary,) throw the earth in rapidly\r\n_behind_ the row of stakes and fascines, giving the dam sufficient width\r\nto resist the pressure of the water from without, and keeping the work\r\nalways in advance of the rising of the tide, so that, during the whole\r\noperation, none of the filling shall be washed away by water flowing over\r\nits top.\r\n\r\nIf the creek has a sloping bottom, the work may be commenced earlier,--as\r\nsoon as the tide commences to recede,--and pushed out to the center of the\r\nchannel by the time the tide is out. When the dam is built, it will be\r\nbest to heavily sod, or otherwise protect its surface against the action\r\nof heavy rains, which would tend to wash it away and weaken it; and the\r\nbed of the creek should be filled in back of the dam for a distance of at\r\nleast fifty yards, to a height greater than that at which water will stand\r\nin the interior drains,--say to within three feet of the surface,--so that\r\nthere shall never be a body of water standing within that distance of the\r\ndam.\r\n\r\nThis is a necessary precaution against the attacks of muskrats, which are\r\nthe principal cause of the insecurity of all salt marsh embankments. It\r\nshould be a cardinal rule with all who are engaged in the construction of\r\nsuch works, never to allow two bodies of water, one on each side of the\r\nbank to be nearer than twenty-five yards of each other, and fifty yards\r\nwould be better. Muskrats do not bore through a bank, as is often\r\nsupposed, to make a passage from one body of water to another, (they would\r\nfind an easier road over the top); but they delight in any elevated mound\r\nin which they can make their homes above the water level and have its\r\nentrance beneath the surface, so that their land enemies cannot invade\r\nthem. When they enter for this purpose, only from one side of the dyke,\r\nthey will do no harm, but if another colony is, at the same time, boring\r\nin from the other side, there is great danger that their burrows will\r\nconnect, and thus form a channel for the admission of water, and destroy\r\nthe work. A disregard of this requirement has caused thousands of acres of\r\nsalt marsh that had been enclosed by dykes having a ditch on each side,\r\n(much the cheapest way to make them,) to be abandoned, and it has induced\r\nthe invention of various costly devices for the protection of embankments\r\nagainst these attacks.(27)\r\n\r\nWhen the creek or estuary to be cut off is very wide, the embankment may\r\nbe carried out, at leisure, from each side, until the channel is only wide\r\nenough to allow the passage of the tide without too great a rush of water\r\nagainst the unfinished ends of the work; but, even in these cases, there\r\nwill be economy in the use of fascines and piles from the first, or of\r\nstones if these can be readily procured. In wide streams, partial\r\nobstructions of the water course will sometimes induce the deposit of silt\r\nin such quantities as will greatly assist the work. No written description\r\nof a single process will suffice for the direction of those having charge\r\nof this most delicate of all drainage operations. Much must be left to the\r\ningenuity of the director of the work, who will have to avail himself of\r\nthe assistance of such favorable circumstances as may, in the case in\r\nhand, offer themselves.\r\n\r\nIf the barrier to be built will require a considerable outlay, it should\r\nbe placed in the hands of a competent engineer, and it will generally\r\ndemand the full measure of his skill and experience.\r\n\r\nThe work cannot be successful, unless the whole line of the water-front is\r\nprotected by a continuous bank, sufficiently high and strong in all of its\r\nparts to resist the action of the highest tides and the strongest waves to\r\nwhich it will be subjected. As it is always open to inspection, at each\r\nebb tide, and can always be approached for repair, it will be easy to keep\r\nit in good condition; and, if properly attended to, it will become more\r\nsolid and effective with age.\r\n\r\n*The removal of the causes of inundation from the upland* is often of\r\nalmost equal importance with the shutting out of the sea, since the amount\r\nof water brought down by rivers, brooks, and hill-side wash, is often more\r\nthan can be removed by any practicable means, by sluice gates, or pumps.\r\n\r\nIt will be quite enough for the capacity of these means of drainage, to\r\nremove the rain-water which falls on the flat land, and that which reaches\r\nit by under-ground springs and by infiltration,--its proper drainage-water\r\nin short,--without adding that which, coming from a higher level, may be\r\nmade to flow off by its own fall.\r\n\r\nCatch-water drains, near the foot of the upland, may be so arranged as to\r\nreceive the surface water of the hills and carry it off, always on a level\r\nabove that of the top of the embankment, and these drains may often be,\r\nwith advantage, enlarged to a sufficient capacity to carry the streams as\r\nwell. If the marsh is divided by an actual river, it may be best to embank\r\nit in two separate tracts; losing the margins, that have been recommended,\r\noutside of the dykes, and building the necessary additional length of\r\nthese, rather than to contend with a large body of water. But, frequently,\r\na very large marsh is traversed by a tortuous stream which occupies a\r\nlarge area, and which, although the tidal water which it contains gives it\r\nthe appearance of a river, is only the outlet of an insignificant stream,\r\nwhich might be carried along the edge of the upland in an ordinary\r\nmill-race. In such case it is better to divert the stream and reclaim the\r\nwhole area.\r\n\r\nWhen a stream is enclosed between dykes, its winding course should be made\r\nstraight in order that its water may be carried off as rapidly as\r\npossible, and the land which it occupies by its deviations, made available\r\nfor cultivation. In the loose, silty soil of a salt marsh, the stream may\r\nbe made to do most of the work of making its new bed, by constructing\r\ntemporary \"jetties,\" or other obstructions to its accustomed flow, which\r\nshall cause its current to deposit silt in its old channel, and to cut a\r\nnew one out of the opposite bank. In some instances it may be well to make\r\nan elevated canal, straight across the tract, by constructing banks high\r\nenough to confine the stream and deliver it over the top of the dyke; in\r\nothers it may be more expedient to carry the stream over, or through, the\r\nhill which bounds the marsh, and cause it to discharge through an\r\nadjoining valley. Improvements of this magnitude, which often affect the\r\ninterest of many owners, or of persons interested in the navigation of the\r\nold channel, or in mill privileges below the point at which the water\r\ncourse is to be diverted, will generally require legislative interference.\r\nBut they not seldom promise immense advantages for a comparatively small\r\noutlay.\r\n\r\nThe instance cited of the Hackensack Meadows, in New Jersey, is a case in\r\npoint. Its area is divided among many owners, and, while ninety-nine acres\r\nin every hundred are given up to muskrats, mosquitoes, coarse rushes and\r\nmalaria, the other one acre may belong to the owner of an adjacent farm\r\nwho values the salt hay which it yields him, and the title to the whole is\r\nvested in many individual proprietors, who could never be induced to unite\r\nin an improvement for the common benefit. Then again, thanks to the tide\r\nthat sets back in the Hackensack River, it is able to float an occasional\r\nvessel to the unimportant villages at the northern end of the meadows, and\r\nthe right of navigation can be interfered with only by governmental\r\naction. If the Hackensack River proper, that part of it which only serves\r\nas an outlet for the drainage of the high land north of the meadows, could\r\nbe diverted and carried through the hills to the Passaic; or confined\r\nwithin straight elevated banks and made to discharge at high water mark at\r\nthe line of the Philadelphia Rail-road;--the wash of the highlands, east\r\nand west of the meadows, being also carried off at this level,--the bridge\r\nof the railroad might be replaced by an earth embankment, less than a\r\nquarter of a mile in length, effecting a complete exclusion of the tidal\r\nflow from the whole tract.\r\n\r\nThis being done, a steam-pump, far less formidable than many which are in\r\nprofitable use in Europe for the same purpose, would empty, and keep\r\nempty, the present bed of the river, which would form a capital outlet for\r\nthe drainage of the whole area. Twenty thousand acres, of the most fertile\r\nland, would thus be added to the available area of the State, greatly\r\nincreasing its wealth, and inducing the settlement of thousands of\r\nindustrious inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAs the circumstances under which upland water reaches lands of the class\r\nunder consideration vary with every locality, no specific directions for\r\nthe treatment of individual cases can be given within the limits of this\r\nchapter; but the problem will rarely be a difficult one.\r\n\r\n*The removal of the rain-fall and water of filtration* is the next point\r\nto be considered.\r\n\r\nSo far as the drainage of the land, in detail, is concerned, it is only\r\nnecessary to say that it may be accomplished, as in the case of any other\r\nlevel land which, from the slight fall that can be allowed the drains,\r\nrequires close attention and great care in the adjustment of the grades.\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty is in providing an outlet for the drains. This can\r\nonly be done by artificial means, as the water must be removed from a\r\nlevel lower than high-water mark,--sometimes lower than low-water.\r\n\r\nIf it is only required that the outlet be at a point somewhat above the\r\nlevel of ordinary low-water, it will be sufficient to provide a sufficient\r\nreservoir, (usually a large open ditch,) to contain the drainage water\r\nthat is discharged while the tide stands above the floor of the outlet\r\nsluice-way, and to provide for its outflow while the level of the tide\r\nwater is below the point of discharge. This is done by means of sluices\r\nhaving self-acting valves, (or tide-gates,) opening outward, which will be\r\nclosed by the weight of the water when the tide rises against them, being\r\nopened again by the pressure of the water from within, as soon the tide\r\nfalls below the level of the water inside of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe gates and sluices may be of wood or iron,--square or round. The best\r\nwould be galvanized iron pipes and valves; but a square wooden trunk,\r\nclosed with a heavy oak gate that fits closely against its outer end, and\r\nmoves freely on its hinges, will answer capitally well, if carefully and\r\nstrongly made. If the gate is of wood, it will be well to have it lie in a\r\nslightly slanting position, so that its own weight will tend to keep it\r\nclosed when the tide first commences to rise above the floor, and might\r\ntrickle in, before it had acquired sufficient head to press the gate\r\nagainst the end of the trunk.\r\n\r\nAs this outlet has to remove, in a short time, all of the water that is\r\ndelivered by the drains and ditches during several hours, it should, of\r\ncourse, be considerably larger than would be required for a constantly\r\nflowing drain from the same area; but the immense gates,--large enough for\r\na canal lock,--which are sometimes used for the drainage of a few acres of\r\nmarsh, are absurd. Not only are they useless, they are really\r\nobjectionable, inasmuch as the greater extent of their joints increases\r\nthe risk of leakage at the time of high water.\r\n\r\nThe channel for the outflow of the water may sometimes, with advantage, be\r\nopen to the top of the dyke or dam,--a canal instead of a trunk; but this\r\nis rarely the better plan, and is only admissible where the discharge is\r\ninto a river or small bay, too small for the formation of high waves, as\r\nthese would be best received on the face of a well sodded, sloping bank.\r\n\r\nThe height, above absolute low water, at which the outlet should be\r\nplaced, will depend on the depth of the outlet of the land drain, and the\r\ndepth of storage room required to receive the drainage water during the\r\nhigher stages of the tide. Of course, it must not be higher than the floor\r\nof the land drain outlet, and, except for the purpose of affording storage\r\nroom, it need not be lower, although all the drainage will discharge, not\r\nonly while the tide water is below the bottom of the gate, but as long as\r\nit remains lower than the level of the water inside. It is well to place\r\nthe mouth of the trunk nearly as low as ordinary low-water mark. This will\r\nfrequently render it necessary to carry a covered drain, of wood or brick,\r\nthrough the mud, out as far as the tide usually recedes,--connected with\r\nthe valve gate at the outlet of the trunk, by a covered box which will\r\nkeep rubbish from obstructing it, or interfering with its action.\r\n\r\n_When the outlet of the land-drains is below low-water mark_, it is of\r\ncourse necessary to pump out the drainage water. This is done by steam or\r\nby wind, the latter being economical only for small tracts which will not\r\nbear the cost of a steam pump. Formerly, this work was done entirely by\r\nwindmills, but these afford only an uncertain power, and often cause the\r\nentire loss of crops which are ready for the harvest, by obstinately\r\nrefusing to work for days after a heavy rain has deluged the land. In\r\ngrass land they are tolerably reliable, and on _small_ tracts in\r\ncultivation, it is easy, by having a good proportion of open ditches, to\r\nafford storage room sufficient for general security; but in the reclaiming\r\nof large areas, (and it is with these that the work is most economical,)\r\nthe steam pump may be regarded as indispensable. It is fast superseding\r\nthe windmills which, a few years ago, were the sole dependence in Holland\r\nand on the English Fens. The magnitude of the pumping machinery on which\r\nthe agriculture of a large part of Holland depends, is astonishing.\r\n\r\nThere are such immense areas of salt marsh in the United States which may\r\nbe tolerably drained by the use of simple valve gates, discharging above\r\nlow-water mark, that it is not very important to consider the question of\r\npumping, except in cases where owners of small tracts, from which a\r\nsufficient tidal outlet could not be secured, (without the concurrence of\r\nadjoining proprietors who might refuse to unite in making the\r\nimprovement,) may find it advisable to erect small pumps for their own\r\nuse. In such cases, it would generally be most economical to use\r\nwind-power, especially if an accessory steam pump be provided for\r\noccasional use, in emergency. Certainly, the tidal drainage should first\r\nbe resorted to, for when the land has once been brought into cultivation,\r\nthe propriety of introducing steam pumps will become more apparent, and\r\nthe outlay will be made with more confidence of profitable return, and, in\r\nall cases, the tidal outlet should be depended on for the outflow of all\r\nwater above its level. It would be folly to raise water by expensive\r\nmeans, which can be removed, even periodically, by natural drainage.\r\n\r\nWhen pumps are used, their discharge pipes should pass through the\r\nembankment, and deliver the water at low-water mark, so that the engine\r\nmay have to operate only against the actual height of the tide water. If\r\nit delivered above high-water mark, it would work, even at low tide,\r\nagainst a constant head, equal to that of the highest tides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. - MALARIAL DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as remote agricultural districts are concerned, it is not probable\r\nthat the mere question of health would induce the undertaking of costly\r\ndrainage operations, although this consideration may operate, in\r\nconnection with the need for an improved condition of soil, as a strong\r\nargument in its favor. As a rule, \"the chills\" are accepted by farmers,\r\nespecially at the West, as one of the slight inconveniences attending\r\ntheir residence on rich lands; and it is not proposed, in this work, to\r\nurge the evils of this terrible disease, and of \"sun pain,\" or \"day\r\nneuralgia,\" as a reason for draining the immense prairies over which they\r\nprevail. The diseases exist,--to the incalculable detriment of the\r\npeople,--and thorough draining would remove them, and would doubtless bring\r\na large average return on the investment;--but the question is, after all,\r\none of capital; and the cost of such draining as would remove\r\nfever-and-ague from the bottom lands and prairies of the West, and from\r\nthe infected agricultural districts at the East, would be more than the\r\nagricultural capital of those districts could spare for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of cities and towns, however, where more wealth has\r\naccumulated, and where the number of persons subjected to the malarial\r\ninfluence is greater, there can be no question as to the propriety of\r\ndraining, even if nothing but improved health be the object.\r\n\r\nThen again, there are immense tracts near the large cities of this country\r\nwhich would be most desirable for residence, were it not that their\r\noccupancy, except with certain constant precautions, implies almost\r\ninevitable suffering from fever-and-ague, or neuralgia.\r\n\r\nVery few neighborhoods within thirty miles of the city of New York are\r\nentirely free from these scourges, whose influence has greatly retarded\r\ntheir occupation by those who are seeking country homes; while many, who\r\nhave braved the dangers of disease in these localities, have had sad cause\r\nto regret their temerity.\r\n\r\nProbably the most striking instance of the effect of malaria on the growth\r\nand settlement of suburban districts, is to be found on Staten Island.\r\nWithin five miles of the Battery; accessible by the most agreeable and\r\nbest managed ferry from the city; practically, nearer to Wall street than\r\nMurray Hill is; with most charming views of land and water; with a\r\nbeautifully diversified surface, and an excellent soil; and affording\r\ncapital opportunities for sea bathing, it should be, (were it not for its\r\nsanitary reputation, it inevitably would be,) one vast residence-park.\r\nExcept on its extreme northern end, and along its higher ridges, it\r\nhas,--and, unfortunately, it deserves,--a most unenviable reputation for\r\ninsalubrity. Here and there, on the southern slope also, there are favored\r\nplaces which are unaccountably free from the pest, but, as a rule, it is,\r\nduring the summer and autumn, unsafe to live there without having constant\r\nrecourse to preventive medication, or exercising unusual and inconvenient\r\nprecautions with regard to exposure to mid-day sun and evening dew. There\r\nare always to be found attractive residences, which are deserted by their\r\nowners, and are offered for sale at absurdly low prices. There are\r\nisolated instances of very thorough and very costly draining, which has\r\nfailed of effect, because so extensive a malarial region cannot be\r\nreclaimed by anything short of a systematic improvement of the whole.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that the thorough drainage of the low lands, valleys\r\nand ponds of the eastern end of the island, including two miles of the\r\nsouth shore, would at once add $5,000,000 to the market value of the real\r\nestate of that section. There can be no question that any radical\r\nimprovement in this respect would remove the only obstacle to the rapid\r\nsettlement of the island by those who wish to live in the country, yet\r\nneed to be near to the business portion of the city. The hope of such\r\nimprovement being made, however, seems as remote as ever,--although any one\r\nat all acquainted with the sources of miasm, in country neighborhoods, can\r\nreadily see the cause of the difficulty, and the means for its removal are\r\nas plainly suggested.\r\n\r\nStaten Island is, by no means, alone in this respect. All who know the\r\nhistory of the settlement of the other suburbs of New York are very well\r\naware that those places which are free from fever-and-ague and malarial\r\nneuralgia, are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nThe exact cause of fever-and-ague and other malarial diseases is unknown,\r\nbut it is demonstrated that, whatever the cause is, it is originated under\r\na combination of circumstances, one of which is undue moisture in the\r\nsoil. It is not necessary that land should be absolutely marshy to produce\r\nthe miasm, for this often arises on cold, springy uplands which are quite\r\nfree from deposits of muck. Thus far, the attention of scientific\r\ninvestigators, given to the consideration of the origin of malarial\r\ndiseases, has failed to discover any well established facts concerning it;\r\nbut there have been developed certain theories, which seem to be sustained\r\nby such knowledge as exists on the subject.\r\n\r\nDr. Bartlett, in his work on the Fevers of the United States, says:--\"The\r\nessential, efficient, producing cause of periodical fever,--the poison\r\nwhose action on the system gives rise to the disease,--is a substance or\r\nagent which has received the names of _malaria_, or _marsh miasm_. The\r\nnature and composition of this poison are wholly unknown to us. Like most\r\nother analogous agents, like the contagious principle of small-pox and of\r\ntyphus, and like the epidemic poison of scarletina and cholera, they are\r\ntoo subtle to be recognized by any of our senses, they are too fugitive to\r\nbe caught by any of our contrivances.\r\n\r\n\"As always happens in such cases and under similar circumstances, in the\r\nabsence of positive knowledge, we have been abundantly supplied with\r\nconjecture and speculation; what observation has failed to discover,\r\nhypothesis has endeavored and professed to supply. It is quite unnecessary\r\neven to enumerate the different substances to which malaria has been\r\nreferred. Amongst them are all of the chemical products and compounds\r\npossible in wet and marshy localities; moisture alone; the products of\r\nanimal and vegetable decomposition; and invisible living organisms. * * *\r\n* Inscrutable, however, as the intimate nature of the substances or agents\r\nmay be, there are some few of its laws and relations which are very well\r\nascertained. One of these consists in its connection with low, or wet, or\r\nmarshy localities. This connection is not invariable and exclusive, that\r\nis, there are marshy localities which are not malarious, and there are\r\nmalarious localities which are not marshy; but there is no doubt whatever\r\nthat it generally exists.\"\r\n\r\nIn a report to the United States Sanitary Commission, Dr. Metcalfe states,\r\nthat all hypotheses, even the most plausible, are entirely unsupported by\r\npositive knowledge, and he says:--\r\n\r\n\"This confession of ignorance still leaves us in possession of certain\r\nknowledge concerning malaria, from which much practical good may be\r\nderived.\r\n\r\n\"1st. It affects, by preference, low and moist localities.\r\n\r\n\"2d. It is almost never developed at a lower temperature than 60 deg.\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\"3d. Its evolution or active agency is checked by a temperature of 32 deg..\r\n\r\n\"4th. It is most abundant and most virulent as we approach the equator and\r\nthe sea-coast.\r\n\r\n\"5th. It has an affinity for dense foliage, which has the power of\r\naccumulating it, when lying in the course of winds blowing from malarious\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n\"6th. Forests, or even woods, have the power of obstructing and preventing\r\nits transmission, under these circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"7th. By atmospheric currents it is capable of being transported to\r\nconsiderable distances--probably as far as five miles.\r\n\r\n\"8th. It may be developed, in previously healthy places, by turning up the\r\nsoil; as in making excavations for foundations of houses, tracks for\r\nrailroads, and beds for canals.\r\n\r\n\"9th. In certain cases it seems to be attracted and absorbed by bodies of\r\nwater lying in the course of such winds as waft it from the miasmatic\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n\"10th. Experience alone can enable us to decide as to the presence or\r\nabsence of malaria, in any given locality.\r\n\r\n\"11th. In proportion as countries, previously malarious, are cleared up\r\nand thickly settled, periodical fevers disappear--in many instances to be\r\nreplaced by the typhoid or typhus.\"\r\n\r\nLa Roche, in a carefully prepared treatise on \"Pneumonia; its Supposed\r\nConnection with Autumnal Fevers,\" recites various theories concerning the\r\nmode of action of marsh miasm, and finds them insufficient to account for\r\nthe phenomena which they produce. He continues as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"All the above hypotheses failing to account for the effects in question,\r\nwe are naturally led to the admission that they are produced by the\r\nmorbific influence of some special agent; and when we take into\r\nconsideration all the circumstances attending the appearance of febrile\r\ndiseases, the circumscribed sphere of their prevalence, the suddenness of\r\ntheir attack, the character of their phenomena, etc., we may safely say\r\nthat there is nothing left but to attribute them to the action of some\r\npoison dissolved or suspended in the air of the infected locality; which\r\npoison, while doubtless requiring for its development and dissemination a\r\ncertain degree of heat, and terrestrial and atmospheric moisture, a\r\ncertain amount of nightly condensation after evaporation, and the presence\r\nof fermenting or decomposing materials, cannot be produced by either of\r\nthese agencies alone, and though indicated by the chemist, betrays its\r\npresence by producing on those exposed to its influence the peculiar\r\nmorbid changes characterizing fever.\"\r\n\r\nHe quotes the following from the Researches of Dr. Chadwick:--\r\n\r\n\"In considering the circumstances external to the residence, which affect\r\nthe sanitary condition of the population, the importance of a general\r\nland-drainage is developed by the inquiries as to the cause of the\r\nprevalent diseases, to be of a magnitude of which no conception had been\r\nformed at the commencement of the investigation. Its importance is\r\nmanifested by the severe consequences of its neglect in every part of the\r\ncountry, as well as by its advantages in the increasing salubrity and\r\nproductiveness wherever the drainage has been skillful and effectual.\"\r\n\r\nLa Roche calls attention to these facts:--That the acclimated residents of\r\na malarious locality, while they are less subject than strangers to active\r\nfever, show, in their physical and even in their mental organization,\r\nevident indications of the ill effects of living in a poisonous\r\natmosphere,--an evil which increases with successive generations, often\r\nresulting in a positive deterioration of the race; that the lower animals\r\nare affected, though in a less degree than man; that deposits of organic\r\nmatter which are entirely covered with water, (as at the bottom of a\r\npond,) are not productive of malaria; that this condition of saturation is\r\ninfinitely preferable to imperfect drainage; that swamps which are shaded\r\nfrom the sun's heat by trees, are not supposed to produce disease; and\r\nthat marshes which are exposed to constant winds are not especially\r\ndeleterious to persons living in their immediate vicinity,--while winds\r\nfrequently carry the emanations of miasmatic districts to points some\r\nmiles distant, where they produce their worst effects. This latter\r\nstatement is substantiated by the fact that houses situated some miles to\r\nthe leeward of low, wet lands, have been especially insalubrious until the\r\nwindows and doors on the side toward the source of the miasm were closed\r\nup, and openings made on the other side,--and thenceforth remained free\r\nfrom the disease, although other houses with openings on the exposed sides\r\ncontinued unhealthy.\r\n\r\nThe literature relating to periodical fevers contains nothing else so\r\ninteresting as the very ingenious article of Dr. J. H. Salisbury, on the\r\n\"Cause of Malarious Fevers,\" contributed to the \"American Journal of\r\nMedical Science,\" for January, 1866. Unfortunately, while there is no\r\nevidence to controvert the statements of this article, they do not seem to\r\nbe honored with the confidence of the profession,--not being regarded as\r\nsufficiently authenticated to form a basis for scientific deductions. Dr.\r\nSalisbury claims to have discovered the cause of malarial fever in the\r\nspores of a very low order of plant, which spores he claims to have\r\ninvariably detected in the saliva, and in the urine, of fever patients,\r\nand in those of no other persons, and which he collected on plates of\r\nglass suspended over all marshes and other lands of a malarious character,\r\nwhich he examined, and which he was never able to obtain from lands which\r\nwere not malarious. Starting from this point, he proceeds, (with\r\ncircumstantial statements that seem to the unprofessional mind to be\r\nsufficient,) to show that the plant producing these spores is always\r\nfound, in the form of a whitish, green, or brick-colored incrustation, on\r\nthe surface of fever producing lands; that the spores, when detached from\r\nthe parent plant, are carried in suspension _only in the moist exhalations\r\nof wet lands_, never rising higher, (usually from 35 to 60 feet,) nor\r\nbeing carried farther, than the humid air itself; that they most\r\naccumulate in the upper strata of the fogs, producing more disease on\r\nlands slightly elevated above the level of the marsh than at its very\r\nedge; that fever-and-ague are never to be found where this plant does not\r\ngrow; that it may be at once introduced into the healthiest locality by\r\ntransporting moist earth on which the incrustation is forming; that the\r\nplant, being introduced into the human system through the lungs, continues\r\nto grow there and causes disease; and that _quinia_ arrests its growth,\r\n(as it checks the multiplication of yeast plants in fermentation,) and\r\nthus suspends the action of the disease.\r\n\r\nProbably it would be impossible to prove that the foregoing theory is\r\ncorrect, though it is not improbable that it contains the germ from which\r\na fuller knowledge of the disease and its causes will be obtained. It is\r\nsufficient for the purposes of this work to say that, so far as Dr.\r\nSalisbury's opinion is valuable, it is,--like the opinion of all other\r\nwriters on the subject,--fully in favor of perfect drainage as the one\r\ngreat preventive of all malarial diseases.\r\n\r\n_The evidence of the effect of drainage_ in removing the cause of malarial\r\ndiseases is complete and conclusive. Instances of such improvement in this\r\ncountry are not rare, but they are much less numerous and less conspicuous\r\nhere than in England, where draining has been much more extensively\r\ncarried out, and where greater pains have been taken to collect testimony\r\nas to its effects.\r\n\r\nIf there is any fact well established by satisfactory experience, it is\r\nthat thorough and judicious draining will entirely remove the local source\r\nof the miasm which produces these diseases.\r\n\r\nThe voluminous reports of various Committees of the English Parliament,\r\nappointed to investigate sanitary questions, are replete with information\r\nconcerning experience throughout the whole country, bearing directly on\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nDr. Whitley, in his report to the Board of Health, (in 1864,) of an\r\nextended tour of observation, says of one town that he examined:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Nicholls, who has been forty years in practice here, and whom I was\r\nunable to see at the time of my visit, writes: Intermittent and remittent\r\nare greatly on the decline since the improved state of drainage of the\r\ntown and surrounding district, and more particularly marked is this\r\nalteration, since the introduction of the water-works in the place.\r\nAlthough we have occasional outbreaks of intermittent and remittent, with\r\nneuralgic attacks, they yield more speedily to remedies, and are not\r\nattended by so much enlargement of the liver or spleen as formerly, and\r\ndysentery is of rare occurrence.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Whitley sums up his case as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It would appear from the foregoing inquiry, that intermittent and\r\nremittent fevers, and their consequences, can no longer be regarded as\r\nseriously affecting the health of the population, in many of the\r\ndistricts, in which those diseases were formerly of a formidable\r\ncharacter. Thus, in Norfolk, Lincolnshire, and Cambridgeshire, counties in\r\nwhich these diseases were both frequent and severe, all the evidence,\r\nexcept that furnished by the Peterborough Infirmary, and, in a somewhat\r\nless degree, in Spaulding, tends to show that they are at the present\r\ntime, comparatively rare and mild in form.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe mentions similar results from his investigations in other parts of the\r\nkingdom, and says:--\r\n\r\n\"It may, therefore, be safely asserted as regards England generally,\r\nthat:--\r\n\r\n\"The diseases which have been made the subject of the present inquiry,\r\nhave been steadily decreasing, both in frequency and severity, for several\r\nyears, _and this decrease is attributed, in nearly every case, mainly to\r\none cause,--improved land drainage;_\" again:\r\n\r\n\"The change of local circumstances, unanimously declared to be the most\r\nimmediate in influencing the prevalence of malarious diseases, is land\r\ndrainage;\" and again:\r\n\r\n\"Except in a few cases in which medical men believed that these affections\r\nbegan to decline previously to the improved drainage of the places\r\nmentioned, the decrease in all of the districts where extensive drainage\r\nhas been carried out, was stated to have commenced about the same time,\r\nand was unhesitatingly attributed to that cause.\"\r\n\r\nA select Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to investigate the\r\ncondition and sanitary influence of the Thames marshes, reported their\r\nminutes of evidence, and their deductions therefrom, in 1854, The\r\nfollowing is extracted from their report:\r\n\r\n\"It appears from the evidence of highly intelligent and eminent gentlemen\r\nof the medical profession, residing in the neighborhood of the marshes on\r\nboth sides of the Thames below London Bridge, that the diseases prevalent\r\nin these districts are highly indicative of malarious influences,\r\nfever-and-ague being very prevalent; and that the sickness and mortality\r\nare greatest in those localities which adjoin imperfectly drained lands,\r\nand far exceed the usual average; and that ague and allied disorders\r\nfrequently extend to the high grounds in the vicinity. In those districts\r\nwhere a partial drainage has been effected, a corresponding improvement in\r\nthe health of the inhabitants is perceptible.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evidence given before the committee, Dr. P. Bossey testified that\r\nthe malaria from salt marshes varied in intensity, being most active in\r\nthe morning and in the Summer season. The marshes are sometimes covered by\r\na little fog, usually not more than three feet thick, which is of a very\r\noffensive odor, and detrimental to health. Away from the marshes, there is\r\na greater tendency to disease on the side toward which the prevailing\r\nwinds blow.\r\n\r\nDr. James Stewart testified that the effect of malaria was greatest when\r\nvery hot weather succeeds heavy rain or floods. He thought that malaria\r\ncould be carried _up_ a slope, but has never been known to descend, and\r\nthat, consequently, an intervening hill affords sufficient protection\r\nagainst marsh malaria. He had known cases where the edges of a river were\r\nhealthy and the uplands malarious.\r\n\r\nIn Santa Maura and Zante, where he had been stationed with the army, he\r\nhad observed that the edge of a marsh would be comparatively healthy,\r\nwhile the higher places in the vicinity were exceedingly unhealthy. He\r\nthought that there were a great many mixed diseases which began like ague\r\nand terminated very differently; those diseases would, no doubt, assume a\r\nvery different form if they were not produced by the marsh air; many\r\ndiseases are very difficult to treat, from being of a mixed character\r\nbeginning like marsh fevers and terminating like inflammatory fevers, or\r\ndiseases of the chest.\r\n\r\nDr. George Farr testified that rheumatism and tic-doloreux were very\r\ncommon among the ladies who live at the Woolwich Arsenal, near the Thames\r\nmarshes. Some of these cases were quite incurable, until the patients\r\nremoved to a purer atmosphere.\r\n\r\nW. H. Gall, M. D., thought that the extent to which malaria affected the\r\nhealth of London, must of course be very much a theoretical question; \"but\r\nit is very remarkable that diseases which are not distinctly miasmatic, do\r\nbecome much more severe in a miasmatic district. Influenzas, which\r\nprevailed in England in 1847, were very much more fatal in London and the\r\nsurrounding parts than they were in the country generally, and influenza\r\nand ague poisons are very nearly allied in their effects. Marsh miasms are\r\nconveyed, no doubt, a considerable distance. Sufficiently authentic cases\r\nare recorded to show that the influence of marsh miasm extends several\r\nmiles.\" Other physicians testify to the fact, that near the Thames\r\nmarshes, the prevalent diseases are all of them of an aguish type,\r\nintermittent and remittent, and that they are accompanied with much\r\ndysentery. Dr. John Manly said that, when he first went to Barking, he\r\nfound a great deal of ague, but since the draining, in a population of ten\r\nthousand, there are not half-a-dozen cases annually and but very little\r\nremittent.\r\n\r\nThe following Extract is taken from the testimony of Sir Culling Eardly,\r\nBart.:\r\n\r\n\"Chairman:--I believe you reside at Belvidere, in the parish of\r\nErith?--Yes.--Ch.: Close to these marshes?--Yes.--Ch.: Can you speak from your\r\nown knowledge, of the state of these marshes, with regard to public\r\nhealth?--Sir C.: I can speak of some of the results which have been\r\nproduced in the neighborhood, from the condition of the marshes; the\r\nneighborhood is in one continual state of ague. My own house is protected,\r\nfrom the height of its position, and a gentleman's house is less liable to\r\nthe influence of malaria than the houses of the lower classes. But even in\r\nmy house we are liable to ague; and to show the extraordinary manner in\r\nwhich the ague operates, in the basement story of this house where my\r\nmen-servants sleep, we have more than once had bad ague. In the attics of\r\nmy house, where my maid-servants sleep, we have never had it. Persons are\r\ndeterred from settling in the neighborhood by the aguish character of the\r\ncountry. Many persons, attracted by the beauty of the locality, wish to\r\ncome down and settle; but when they find the liability to ague, they are\r\ncompelled to give up their intention. I may mention that the village of\r\nErith itself, bears marks of the influence of malaria. It is more like one\r\nof the desolate towns of Italy, Ferrara, for instance, than a healthy,\r\nhappy, English village. I do not know whether it is known to the\r\ncommittee, that Erith is the village described in Dickens' _Household\r\nWords_, as Dumble-down-deary, and that it is a most graphic and correct\r\ndescription of the state of the place, attributable to the unhealthy\r\ncharacter of the locality.\"\r\n\r\nHe also stated that the ague is not confined to the marshes, but extends\r\nto the high lands near them.\r\n\r\nThe General Board of Health, of England, at the close of a voluminous\r\nreport, publish the following \"Conclusions as to the Drainage of Suburban\r\nLands:--\r\n\r\n\"1. Excess of moisture, even on lands not evidently wet, is a cause of\r\nfogs and damps.\r\n\r\n\"2. Dampness serves as a medium for the conveyance of any decomposing\r\nmatter that may be evolved, and adds to the injurious effects of such\r\nmatters in the air:--in other words the excess of moisture may be said to\r\nincrease or aggravate atmospheric impurities.\r\n\r\n\"3. The evaporation of the surplus moisture lowers the temperature,\r\nproduces chills, and creates or aggravates the sudden and injurious\r\nchanges or fluctuations by which health is injured.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing opinions as to the cause of malaria, and of the\r\nevidence as to the effect of draining in removing the unhealthy condition\r\nin which those causes originate, it is not too much to say that,--in\r\naddition to the capital effect of draining on the productive capacity of\r\nthe land,--the most beneficial sanitary results may be confidently expected\r\nfrom the extension of the practice, especially in such localities as are\r\nnow unsafe, or at least undesirable for residence.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the completeness and efficiency of the means for the\r\nremoval of surplus water from the soil:--in proportion, that is, to the\r\ndegree in which the improved tile drainage described in these pages is\r\nadopted,--will be the completeness of the removal of the causes of disease.\r\nSo far as the drying of malarious lands is concerned, it is only necessary\r\nto construct drains in precisely the same manner as for agricultural\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the waste of houses, and of other filth, will be considered\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. - HOUSE DRAINAGE AND TOWN SEWERAGE IN THEIR RELATIONS TO THE\r\nPUBLIC HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is extracted from a report made by the General Board of\r\nHealth to the British Parliament, concerning the administration of the\r\nPublic Health Act and the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Acts\r\nfrom 1848 to 1854.\r\n\r\n\"Where instances have been favorable for definite observation, as in broad\r\nblocks of buildings, the effects of sanitary improvement have been already\r\nmanifested to an extent greater than could have been anticipated, and than\r\ncan be readily credited by those who have not paid attention to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"In one favorable instance, that of between 600 and 700 persons of the\r\nworking class in the metropolis, during a period of three years, the\r\naverage rate of mortality has been reduced to between 13 and 14 in 1000.\r\nIn another instance, for a shorter period, among 500 persons, the\r\nmortality has been reduced as low as even 7 in 1000. The average rate of\r\nmortality for the whole metropolis being 23 in 1000.\r\n\r\n\"In another instance, the abolishing of cess-pools and their replacement\r\nby water-closets, together with the abolishing of brick drains and their\r\nreplacement by impermeable and self-cleansing stone-ware pipes, has been\r\nattended with an immediate and extraordinary reduction of mortality. Thus,\r\nin Lambeth Square, occupied by a superior class of operatives, in the\r\nreceipt of high wages, the deaths, which in ordinary times were above the\r\ngeneral average, or more than 30 in 1000, had risen to a rate of 55 in\r\n1000. By the abolishing of cess-pools, which were within the houses, and\r\nthe substitution of water-closets, and with the introduction of tubular,\r\nself-cleansing house-drains, the mortality has been reduced to 13 in 1000.\r\n\r\n\"The reduction of the mortality was effected precisely among the same\r\noccupants, without any change in their habits whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sewers are less important than the House-Drains and Water-Closets, and if\r\nnot carrying much water, may become cess-pools. In the case of the Square\r\njust referred to, when cess-pools and drains of deposit were removed\r\nwithout any alteration whatever in the adjacent sewers, fevers disappeared\r\nfrom house to house, as these receptacles were filled up, and the\r\nwater-closet apparatus substituted, merely in consequence of the removal\r\nof the decomposing matter from beneath the houses to a distant sewer of\r\ndeposit or open water course.\r\n\r\n\"If the mortality were at the same rate as in the model dwellings, or in\r\nthe improved dwellings in Lambeth Square, the annual deaths for the whole\r\nof the metropolis would be 25,000 less, and for the whole of England and\r\nWales 170,000 less than the actual deaths.\r\n\r\n\"If the reduced rate of mortality in these dwellings should continue, and\r\nthere appears to be no reason to suppose that it will not, the extension\r\nto all towns which have been affected, of the improvements which have been\r\napplied in these buildings, would raise the average age at death to about\r\nforty-eight instead of twenty-nine, the present average age at death of\r\nthe inhabitants of towns in all England and Wales.\"\r\n\r\nThe branch of the Art of Drainage which relates to the removal of the\r\nfecal and other refuse wastes of the population of towns, is quite\r\ndifferent from that which has been described in the preceding pages, as\r\napplicable to the agricultural and sanitary improvement of lands under\r\ncultivation, and of suburban districts. Still, the fact that town and\r\nhouse drainage affords a means for the preservation of valuable manures,\r\njustifies its discussion in an agricultural work, and \"draining for\r\nhealth\" would stop far short of completeness were no attention paid to the\r\nremoval of the cause of diseases, which are far more fatal than those that\r\noriginate in an undrained condition of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which these diseases, (of which typhoid fever is a type,)\r\nare prevented by sanitary drainage, is strikingly shown in the extract\r\nwhich commences this chapter. Since the experience to which this report\r\nrefers, it has been found that the most fatal epidemics of the lower\r\nportions of London originated in the choked condition of the street\r\nsewers, whose general character, as well as the plan of improvement\r\nadopted are described in the following \"Extracts from the Report of the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works,\" made in 1866.\r\n\r\n\"The main sewers discharged their whole contents direct into the Thames,\r\nthe majority of them capable of being emptied only at the time of low\r\nwater; consequently, as the tide rose, the outlets of the sewers were\r\nclosed, and the sewage was dammed back, and became stagnant; the sewage\r\nand impure waters were also constantly flowing from the higher grounds, in\r\nsome instances during 18 out of the 24 hours, and thus the thick and heavy\r\nsubstances were deposited, which had to be afterwards removed by the\r\ncostly process of hand labor. During long continued or copious falls of\r\nrain, more particularly when these occurred at the time of high water in\r\nthe river, the closed outlets not having sufficient storage capacity to\r\nreceive the increased volume of sewage, the houses and premises in the low\r\nlying districts, especially on the south side of the river, became flooded\r\nby the sewage rising through the house drains, and so continued until the\r\ntide had receded sufficiently to afford a vent for the pent-up waters,\r\nwhen the sewage flowed and deposited itself along the banks of the river,\r\nevolving gases of a foul and offensive character.\r\n\r\n\"This state of things had a most injurious effect upon the condition of\r\nthe Thames; for not only was the sewage carried up the river by the rising\r\ntide, at a time when the volume of pure water was at its minimum, and\r\nquite insufficient to dilute and disinfect it, but it was brought back\r\nagain into the heart of the metropolis, there to mix with each day's fresh\r\nsupply, until the gradual progress towards the sea of many day's\r\naccumulation could be plainly discerned; the result being that the portion\r\nof the river within the metropolitan district became scarcely less impure\r\nand offensive than the foulest of the sewers themselves. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"The Board, by the system they have adopted, have sought to abolish the\r\nevils which hitherto existed, by constructing new lines of sewers, laid in\r\na direction at right angles to that of the existing sewers, and a little\r\nbelow their levels, so as to intercept their contents and convey them to\r\nan outfall, on the north side of the Thames about 11-1/4 miles, and on the\r\nsouth side about 14 miles, below London Bridge. By this arrangement as\r\nlarge a proportion of the sewage as practicable is carried away by\r\ngravitation, and a constant discharge for the remainder is provided by\r\nmeans of pumping. At the outlets, the sewage is delivered into reservoirs\r\nsituate on the banks of the Thames, and placed at such levels as enable\r\nthem to discharge into the river at or about the time of high water. The\r\nsewage thus becomes not only at once diluted by the large volume of water\r\nin the river at the time of high water, but is also carried by the ebb 26\r\nmiles below London Bridge, and its return by the following flood-tide\r\nwithin the metropolitan area, is effectually prevented.\"\r\n\r\nThe details of this stupendous enterprise are of sufficient interest to\r\njustify the introduction here of the \"General Statistics of the Works\" as\r\nreported by the Board.\r\n\r\n\"A few statistics relative to the works may not prove uninteresting. The\r\nfirst portion of the works was commenced in January 1859, being about five\r\nmonths after the passing of the Act authorising their execution. There are\r\n82 miles of main intercepting sewers in London. In the construction of the\r\nworks 318,000,000 of bricks, and 880,000 cubic yards of concrete have been\r\nused, and 3,500,000 cubic yards of earth excavated. The cost, when\r\ncompleted, will have been about L4,200,000. The total pumping power\r\nemployed is 2,300 nominal horse power: and if the engines were at full\r\nwork, night and day, 44,000 tons of coals per annum would be used; but the\r\naverage consumption is estimated at 20,000 tons. The sewage to be\r\nintercepted by the works on the north side of the river, at present\r\namounts to 10,000,000 cubic feet, and on the south side 4,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet per day; but provision is made for an anticipated increase in these\r\nquantities, in addition to the rainfall, amounting to a total of\r\n63,000,000 cubic feet per day, which is equal to a lake of 482 acres,\r\nthree feet deep, or 15 times as large as the Serpentine in Hyde Park.\"\r\n\r\nA very large portion of the sewage has to be lifted thirty-six feet to the\r\noutfall sewer. The works on the north side of the Thames were formally\r\nopened, by the Prince of Wales, in April 1865.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that the immense amount of sewage, for which an escape has\r\nbeen thus provided, might be profitably employed in agriculture,\r\nadvertisements were inserted in the public journals asking for proposals\r\nfor carrying out such a scheme; and arrangements were subsequently made\r\nfor an extension of the works, by private enterprise, by the construction\r\nof a culvert nine and a half feet in diameter, and forty miles in length,\r\ncapable of carrying 12,000,000 cubic feet of sewage per day to the barren\r\nsands on the coast of Essex; the intention being to dispose of the liquid\r\nto farmers along the line, and to use the surplus for the fertilization of\r\n7000 acres, (to be subsequently increased,) which are to be reclaimed from\r\nthe sea by embankments and valve sluice-gates.\r\n\r\nThe estimated cost of this enterprise is about $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe work which has been done, and which is now in contemplation, in\r\nEngland, is suggestive of what might, with advantage, be adopted in the\r\nlarger cities in America. Especially in New York an improved means of\r\noutlet is desirable, and it is doubtful whether the high rate of mortality\r\nof that city will be materially reduced before effective measures are\r\ndevised for removing the vast accumulations of filth, which ebb and flow\r\nin many of the larger sewers, with each change of the tide; and which are\r\ndeposited between the piers along the river-sides.\r\n\r\nIt would be practicable to construct a main receiving sewer under the\r\nriver streets, skirting the city, from the vicinity of Bellevue Hospital\r\non the east side, passing near the outer edge of the Battery, and\r\ncontinuing to the high land near 60th street on the west side; having its\r\nwater level at least twenty feet below the level of the street, and\r\nreceiving all of the sewage which now flows into the river. At the\r\nBattery, this receiving sewer might be connected, by a tunnel, with the\r\nBrooklyn shore, its contents being carried to a convenient point south of\r\nFort Hamilton,--where their discharge, (by lifting steam pumps), into the\r\nwaters of the Lower Bay, would be attended with no inconvenience. The\r\nimprovement being carried out to this point, it would probably not be long\r\nbefore the advantages to result from the application of the sewage to the\r\nsandy soil on the south side of Long Island would be manifest.\r\n\r\nThe effect of such an improvement on the health of the city,--which is now\r\nin constant danger from the putrefying filth of the sewers, (these being\r\nlittle better than covered cess-pools under the streets,)--would, no doubt,\r\nequal the improvement that has resulted from similar work in London.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing relates only to the main outlets for town sewage. The\r\narterial drainage, (the lateral drains of the system,) which receives the\r\nwaste of the houses and the wash of the streets, is entirely dependent on\r\nthe outlet sewers, and can be effective only when these are so constructed\r\nas to afford a free outfall for the matters that it delivers to them. In\r\nmany towns, owing to high situation, or to a rapid inclination of surface,\r\nthe outfall is naturally so good as to require but little attention. In\r\nall cases, the manner of constructing the collecting drains is a matter of\r\ngreat importance, and in this work a radical change has been introduced\r\nwithin a few years past.\r\n\r\nFormerly, immense conduits of porous brick work, in all cases large enough\r\nto be entered to be cleansed, by hand labor, of their accumulated\r\ndeposits, were considered necessary for the accommodation of the smallest\r\ndischarge. The consequence of this was, that, especially in sewers\r\ncarrying but little water, the solid matters contained in the sewage were\r\ndeposited by the sluggish flow, frequently causing the entire obstruction\r\nof the passages. Such drains always required frequent and expensive\r\ncleansing by hand, and the decomposition of the filth which they contained\r\nproduced a most injurious effect on the health of persons living near\r\ntheir connections with the street. The foul liquids with which they were\r\nfilled, passing through their porous walls, impregnated the earth near\r\nthem, and sometimes reached to the cellars of adjacent houses, which were\r\nin consequence rendered extremely unhealthy. Many such sewers are now in\r\nexistence, and some such are still being constructed. Not only are they\r\nunsatisfactory, they are much more expensive in construction, and require\r\nmuch attention and labor for repairs, and cleansing, than do the\r\nstone-ware pipe sewers which are now universally adopted wherever measures\r\nare taken to investigate their comparative merits. An example of the\r\ndifference between the old and modern styles of sewers is found in the\r\ndrainage of the Westminster School buildings, etc., in London.\r\n\r\nThe new drainage conveys the house and surface drainage of about two acres\r\non which are fifteen large houses. The whole length of the drain is about\r\nthree thousand feet, and the entire outlet is through two nine inch pipes.\r\nThe drainage is perfectly removed, and the pipes are always clean, no foul\r\nmatters being deposited at any point. This drainage has been adopted as a\r\nsubstitute for an old system of sewerage of which the main was from 4 feet\r\nhigh, by 3 feet 6 inches wide, to 17 feet high and 6 or 7 feet wide. The\r\nhouses had cess-pools beneath them, which were filled with the\r\naccumulations of many years, while the sewers themselves were scarcely\r\nless offensive. This condition resulted in a severe epidemic fever of a\r\nvery fatal character.\r\n\r\nAn examination instituted to discover the cause of the epidemic resulted\r\nin the discovery of the facts set forth above, and there were removed from\r\nthe drains and cess-pools more than 550 loads of ordure. The evaporating\r\nsurface of this filth was more than 2000 square yards.\r\n\r\nSince the new drainage, not only has there been no recurrence of epidemic\r\nfever, but \"a greater improvement in the general health of the population\r\nhas succeeded than might be reasonably expected in a small block of\r\nhouses, amidst an ill-conditioned district, from which it cannot be\r\ncompletely isolated.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle which justifies the use of pipe sewers is precisely that\r\nwhich has been described in recommending small tiles for agricultural\r\ndrainage,--_to wit_: that the rapidity of a flow of water, and its power to\r\nremove obstacles, is in proportion to its depth as compared with its\r\nwidth. It has been found in practice, that a stream which wends its\r\nsluggish way along the bottom of a large brick culvert, when concentrated\r\nwithin the area of a small pipe of regular form, flows much more rapidly,\r\nand will carry away even whole bricks, and other substances which were an\r\nobstacle to its flow in the larger channel. As an experiment as to the\r\nefficacy of small pipes Mr. Hale, the surveyor, who was directed by the\r\nGeneral Board of Health of London to make the trial, laid a 12-inch pipe\r\nin the bottom of a sewer 5 feet and 6 inches high, and 3 feet and 6 inches\r\nwide. The area drained was about 44 acres. He found the velocity of the\r\nstream in the pipe to be four and a half times greater than that of the\r\nsame amount of water in the sewer. The pipe at no time accumulated silt,\r\nand the force of the water issuing from the end of the pipe kept the\r\nbottom of the sewer perfectly clear for the distance of 12 feet, beyond\r\nwhich point some bricks and stones were deposited, their quantity\r\nincreasing with the distance from the pipe. He caused sand, pieces of\r\nbricks, stones, mud, etc., to be put into the head of the pipe. These were\r\nall carried clear through the pipe, but were deposited in the sewer below\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt has been found by experiment that in a flat bottomed sewer, four feet\r\nwide, having a fall of eight inches in one hundred feet, a stream of water\r\none inch depth, runs very sluggishly, while the same water running through\r\na 12-inch pipe, laid on the same inclination, forms a rapid stream,\r\ncarrying away the heavy silt which was deposited in the broad sewer. As a\r\nconsequence of this, it has been found, where pipe sewers are used, even\r\non almost imperceptible inclinations, that silt is very rarely deposited,\r\nand the waste matters of house and street drainage are carried immediately\r\nto the outlet, instead of remaining to ferment and poison the atmosphere\r\nof the streets through which they pass. In the rare cases of obstruction\r\nwhich occur, the pipes are very readily cleansed by flushing, at a tithe\r\nof the cost of the constant hand-work required in brick sewers.\r\n\r\nFor the first six or seven hundred feet at the head of a sewer, a six inch\r\npipe will remove all of the house and street drainage, even during a heavy\r\nrain fall; and if the inclination is rapid, (say 6 inches to 100 feet,)\r\nthe acceleration of the flow, caused partly by the constant additions to\r\nthe water, pipes of this size may be used for considerably greater\r\ndistances. It has been found by actual trial that it is not necessary to\r\nincrease the size of the pipe sewer in exact proportion to the amount of\r\ndrainage that it has to convey, as each addition to the flow, where\r\ndrainage is admitted from street openings or from houses, accelerates the\r\nvelocity of the current, pipes discharging even eight times as much when\r\nreceived at intervals along the line as they would take from a full head\r\nat the upper end of the sewer.\r\n\r\nFor a district inhabited by 10,000 persons, a 12-inch pipe would afford a\r\nsufficient outlet, unless the amount of road drainage were unusually\r\nlarge, and for the largest sewers, pipes of more than 18 inches diameter\r\nare rarely used, these doing the work which, under the old system, was\r\nalloted to a sewer 6 feet high and 3 feet broad.\r\n\r\nOf course, the connections by which the drainage of roads is admitted to\r\nthese sewers, must be provided with ample silt-basins, which require\r\nfrequent cleaning out. In the construction of the sewers, man-holes, built\r\nto the surface, are placed at sufficient intervals, and at all points\r\nwhere the course of the sewer changes, so that a light placed at one of\r\nthese may be seen from the next one;--the contractor being required to lay\r\nthe sewer so that the light may be thus seen, a straight line both of\r\ninclination and direction is secured.\r\n\r\nThe rules which regulate the laying of land-drains apply with equal force\r\nin the making of sewers, that is no part of the pipe should be less\r\nperfect, either in material or construction, than that which lies above\r\nit; and where the inclination becomes less, in approaching the outlet,\r\nsilt-basins should be employed, unless the decreased fall is still rapid.\r\nThe essential point of difference is, that while land drains may be of\r\nporous material, and should have open joints for the admission of water,\r\nsewer pipes should be of impervious glazed earthen-ware, and their joints\r\nshould be securely cemented, to prevent the escape of the sewage, which it\r\nis their province to remove, not to distribute. Drains from houses, which\r\nneed not be more than 3 or 4 inches in diameter, should be of the same\r\nmaterial, and should discharge with considerable inclination into the\r\npipes, being connected with a curving branch, directing the fluid towards\r\nthe outlet.\r\n\r\nIn laying a sewer, it is customary to insert a pipe with a branch opposite\r\neach house, or probable site of a house.\r\n\r\nIt is important that, in towns not supplied with waterworks, measures be\r\ntaken to prevent the admission of too much solid matter in the drainage of\r\nhouses. Water being the motive power for the removal of the solid parts of\r\nthe sewage, unless there be a public supply which can be turned on at\r\npleasure, no house should deliver more solid matter than can be carried\r\naway by its refuse waters.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of houses is one of the chief objects of sewerage.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the cases cited above of the model lodging houses in\r\nLambeth Square, and of the buildings at Westminster, it may be well to\r\nrefer to a remarkable epidemic which broke out in the Maplewood Young\r\nLadies' Institute in Pittsfield, Mass., in 1864, which was of so violent\r\nand fatal a character as to elicit a special examination by a committee of\r\nphysicians. The family consisted, (pupils, servants, and all,) of one\r\nhundred and twelve persons. Of these, fifty-one were attacked with\r\nwell-defined typhoid fever during a period of less than three weeks. Of\r\nthis number thirteen died. The following is extracted from the report of\r\nthe committee:\r\n\r\n\"Of the 74 resident pupils heard from, 66 are reported as having had\r\nillness of some kind at the close of the school or soon after. This is a\r\nproportion of 33/37 or nearly 90 per cent. Of the same 74, fifty-one had\r\ntyphoid fever, or a proportion of nearly 69 per cent. If all the people in\r\nthe town, say 8000, had been affected in an equal proportion, more than\r\n7000 would have been ill during these few weeks, and about 5500 of them\r\nwould have had typhoid fever, and of these over 1375 would have died. If\r\nit would be a more just comparison to take the whole family at Maplewood\r\ninto the account, estimating the number at 112, fifty-six had typhoid\r\nfever, or 50 per cent., and of these fifty-six, sixteen died, or over 28.5\r\nper cent. These proportions applied to the whole population of 8000, would\r\ngive 4000 of typhoid fever in the same time; and of these 1140 would have\r\ndied. According to the testimony of the practising physicians of\r\nPittsfield, the number of cases of typhoid fever, during this period,\r\naside from those affected by the influences at Maplewood, was small, some\r\nphysicians not having had any, others had two or three.\" These cases\r\namounted to but eight, none of which terminated fatally.\r\n\r\nThe whole secret of this case was proven to have been the retention of the\r\nordure and waste matter from the kitchens and dormitories in privies and\r\nvaults, underneath or immediately adjoining the buildings, the odor from\r\nthese having been offensively perceptible, and under certain atmospheric\r\nconditions, having pervaded the whole house.\r\n\r\nThe committee say \"it would be impossible to bring this report within\r\nreasonable limits, were we to discuss the various questions connected with\r\nthe origin and propagation of typhoid fever, although various theoretical\r\nviews are held as to whether the poison producing the disease is generated\r\nin the bodies of the sick, and communicated from them to the well, or\r\nwhether it is generated in sources exterior to the bodies of fever\r\npatients, yet all authorities maintain that a peculiar poison is concerned\r\nin its production.\r\n\r\n\"Those who hold to the doctrine of contagion admit that, to give such\r\ncontagion efficacy in the production of wide spread results, filth or\r\ndecaying organic matter is essential; while those who sustain the theory\r\nof non-contagion--the production of the poison from sources without the\r\nbodies of the sick--contend that it has its entire origin in such filth--in\r\ndecomposing matter, especially in fermenting sewage, and decaying human\r\nexcreta.\r\n\r\n\"The injurious influence of decomposing azotised matter, in either\r\npredisposing to or exciting severe disease, and particularly typhoid\r\nfever, is universally admitted among high medical authorities.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee were of the opinion \"that the disease at Maplewood\r\nessentially originated in the state of the privies and drainage of the\r\nplace; the high temperature, and other peculiar atmospheric conditions\r\ndeveloping, in the organic material thus exposed, a peculiar poison, which\r\naccumulated in sufficient quantity to pervade the whole premises, and\r\noperated a sufficient length of time to produce disease in young and\r\nsusceptible persons. * * * * * *  To prevent the poison of typhoid fever\r\nwhen taken into the system, from producing its legitimate effects, except\r\nby natural agencies, would require as positive a miracle as to restore a\r\nsevered head, or arrest the course of the heavenly bodies in their\r\nspheres. * * * The lesson for all, for the future, is too obvious to need\r\nfurther pointing out; and the committee cannot doubt that they would\r\nhazard little in predicting that the wisdom obtained by this sad\r\nexperience, will be of value in the future management of this institution,\r\nand secure precautions which will forever prevent the recurrence of such a\r\ncalamity.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of all sanitary investigation indicate clearly the vital\r\nnecessity for the complete and speedy removal from human habitations of\r\nall matters which, by their decomposition, may tend to the production of\r\ndisease, and early measures should be taken by the authorities of all\r\ntowns, especially those which are at all compactly built, to secure this\r\nremoval. The means by which this is to be effected are to be found in such\r\na combination of water-supply and sewerage, as will furnish a constant and\r\ncopious supply of water to dissolve or hold in suspension the whole of the\r\nwaste matters, and will provide a channel through which they may be\r\ncarried away from the vicinity of residences. If means for the application\r\nof the sewage water to agricultural lands can be provided, a part if not\r\nthe whole of the cost of the works will be thus returned.\r\n\r\nConcerning the details of house drainage, it would be impossible to say\r\nmuch within the limits of this book. The construction of water-closets,\r\nsoil-pipes, sinks, etc., are too will be understood to need a special\r\ndescription here.\r\n\r\nThe principal point, (aside from the use of pipes instead of brick-sewers\r\nand brick house-drains,) is what is called in London the system of Back\r\nDrainage, where only principal main lines of sewers are laid under the\r\nstreets, all collecting sewers passing through the centres of the blocks\r\nin the rear of the houses. Pipes for water supply are disposed in the same\r\nmanner, as it is chiefly at the rears of houses that water is required,\r\nand that drainage is most necessary; and this adjustment saves the cost,\r\nthe annoyance and the loss of fall, which accompany the use of pipes\r\nrunning under the entire length of each house. Much tearing up of\r\npavements, expensive ditching in hard road-ways, and interference with\r\ntraffic is avoided, while very much less ditching and piping is necessary,\r\nand repairs are made with very little annoyance to the occupants of\r\nhouses. The accompanying diagrams, (Figs. 48-49,) illustrate the\r\ndifference between the old system of drainage with brick sewers under the\r\nstreets, and brick drains under the houses, and pipe sewers under main\r\nstreets and through the back yards of premises. A measurement of these two\r\nmethods will show that the lengths of the drains in the new system, are to\r\nthose of the old, as 1 to 2-1/4;--the fall of the house drains, (these\r\nhaving much less length,) would be 10 times more in the one case than in\r\nthe other;--the main sewers would have twice the fall, their area would be\r\nonly 1/30], and their cubic contents only 1/73.\r\n\r\n            [Fig. 48 - OLD STYLE HOUSE DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE.]\r\n\r\n             Fig. 48 - OLD STYLE HOUSE DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience in England has shown that if the whole cost of water supply and\r\npipe sewers is, with its interest, divided over a period of thirty\r\nyears,--so that at the end of that time it should all be repaid,--the annual\r\ncharge would not be greater than the cost of keeping house-drains and\r\ncess-pools pools clean. The General Board of Health state that \"the\r\nexpense of cleansing the brick house-drains and cess-pools for four or\r\nfive years, would pay the expense of properly constructed water-closets\r\nand pipe-drains, for the greater number of old premises.\"\r\n\r\n             [Fig. 49 - MODERN HOUSE DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE.]\r\n\r\n              Fig. 49 - MODERN HOUSE DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the reports of this body, which has added more than any other\r\norganization to the world's knowledge on these subjects, closes with the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"Conclusions obtained as to house drainage, and the sewerage and cleansing\r\nof the sites of towns.\"\r\n\r\n\"That no population living amidst impurities, arising from the putrid\r\nemanations from cess-pools, drains and sewers of deposit, can be healthy\r\nor free from the attacks of devastating epidemics.\r\n\r\n\"That as a primary condition of salubrity, no ordure and town refuse can\r\nbe permitted to remain beneath or near habitations.\r\n\r\n\"That by no means can remedial operations be so conveniently,\r\neconomically, inoffensively, and quickly effected as by the removal of all\r\nsuch refuse dissolved or suspended in water.\r\n\r\n\"That it has been subsequently proved by the operation of draining houses\r\nwith tubular drains, in upwards of 19,000 cases, and by the trial of more\r\nthan 200 miles of pipe sewers, that the practice of constructing large\r\nbrick or stone sewers for general town drainage, which detain matters\r\npassing into them in suspension in water, which accumulate deposit, and\r\nwhich are made large enough for men to enter them, and remove the deposit\r\nby hand labor, without reference to the area to be drained, has been in\r\nignorance, neglect or perversion of the above recited principles.\r\n\r\n\"That while sewers so constructed are productive of great injury to the\r\npublic health, by the diffusion into houses and streets of the noxious\r\nproducts of the decomposing matters contained in them, they are wasteful\r\nfrom the increased expense of their construction and repair, and from the\r\ncost of ineffectual efforts to keep them free from deposit.\r\n\r\n\"That the house-drains, made as they have heretofore been, of absorbent\r\nbrick or stone, besides detaining substances in suspension, accumulating\r\nfoul deposit, and being so permeable as to permit the escape of the liquid\r\nand gaseous matters, are also false in principle and wasteful in the\r\nexpense of construction, cleansing and repair.\r\n\r\n\"That it results from the experience developed in these inquiries, that\r\nimproved tubular house-drains and sewers of the proper sizes,\r\ninclinations, and material, detain and accumulate no deposit, emit no\r\noffensive smells, and require no additional supplies of water to keep them\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n\"That the offensive smells proceeding from any works intended for house or\r\ntown drainage, indicate the fact of the detention and decomposition of\r\nordure, and afford decisive evidence of mal-construction or of ignorant or\r\ndefective arrangement.\r\n\r\n\"That the method of removing refuse in suspension in water by properly\r\ncombined works, is much better than that of collecting it in pits or\r\ncess-pools near or underneath houses, emptying it by hand labor, and\r\nremoving it by carts.\r\n\r\n\"That it is important for the sake of economy, as well as for the health\r\nof the population, that the practice of the removal of refuse in\r\nsuspension in water, and by combined works, should be applied to all\r\nhouses, especially those occupied by the poorer classes.\"\r\n\r\nLater investigations of the subject have established two general\r\nconclusions applicable to the subject, namely, that:\r\n\r\n\"_In towns all offensive smells from the decomposition of animal and\r\nvegetable matter, indicate the generation and presence of the causes of\r\ninsalubrity and of preventable disease, at the same time that they prove\r\ndefective local administration;_ and correlatively, that:\r\n\r\n\"_In rural districts all continuous offensive smells from animal and\r\nvegetable decomposition, indicate preventable loss of fertilizing matter,\r\nloss of money, and bad husbandry._\"\r\n\r\nThe principles herein set forth, whether relating to sanitary improvement,\r\nto convenience and decency of living, or to the use of waste matters of\r\nhouses in agricultural improvement, are no less applicable in America than\r\nelsewhere; and the more general adoption of improved house drainage and\r\nsewerage, and of the use of sewage matters in agriculture, would add to\r\nthe health and prosperity of its people, and would indicate a great\r\nadvance in civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n      Absorption and Filtration, 26-39\r\n      Angles to be, as far as possible, avoided, 99\r\n\r\n      Baking of clay soils by evaporation, 30\r\n      Barley, 168\r\n      Bartlett, Dr., quotation from, 211\r\n      Base-line, 145\r\n      Boning-rods, (with illustrations), 125-126\r\n\r\n      Central Park, 74-86\r\n      Cess-pools, cause of epidemics, 237\r\n      Chadwick, Dr., quotation from, 213\r\n      Clay Soils, 75\r\n      Clay Soils, Baking of by Evaporation, 30\r\n      Clay Soils, Made mellow by draining, 29-30\r\n      Clay Soils, Shrinkage of, 28\r\n      Clinometer, (illustration), 56\r\n      Collars, 84\r\n      Connections, 132\r\n      Connections  (illustrations), 134\r\n      Corn, Indian, 162\r\n      Cost of draining, 150-153-158\r\n      Cotton, 169\r\n      Covering and filling, cost of, 157\r\n      Covering  for the joints of tiles, 132\r\n      Covering tiles, 136\r\n\r\n      Datum-line, 52-104\r\n      Denton, J.

FULLER.\r\n\r\n_Beautifully Illustrated._\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore had no work especially devoted to small fruits, and\r\ncertainly no treatises anywhere that give the information contained in\r\nthis. It is to the advantage of special works that the author can say all\r\nthat he has to say on any subject, and not be restricted as to space, as\r\nhe must be in those works that cover the culture of all fruits--great and\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThis book covers the whole ground of Propagating Small Fruits, their\r\nCulture, Varieties, Packing for Market, etc. While very full on the other\r\nfruits, the Currants and Raspberries have been more carefully elaborated\r\nthan ever before, and in this important part of his book, the author has\r\nhad the invaluable counsel of Charles Downing. The chapter on gathering\r\nand packing the fruit is a valuable one, and in it are figured all the\r\nbaskets and boxes now in common use. The book is very finely and\r\nthoroughly illustrated, and makes an admirable companion to the Grape\r\nCulturist, by the same author.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS:\r\n\r\nCHAP. I. BARBERRY.\r\nCHAP. II.

WARDER,\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT OHIO POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY; VICE-PRESIDENT AMERICAN POMOLOGICAL\r\nSOCIETY.\r\n\r\n293 ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nThis volume has about 750 pages, the first 375 of which are devoted to the\r\ndiscussion of the general subjects of propagation, nursery culture,\r\nselection and planting, cultivation of orchards, care of fruit, insects,\r\nand the like; the remainder is occupied with descriptions of apples. With\r\nthe richness of material at hand, the trouble was to decide what to leave\r\nout. It will be found that while the old and standard varieties are not\r\nneglected, the new and promising sorts, especially those of the South and\r\nWest, have prominence. A list of selections for different localities by\r\neminent orchardists is a valuable portion of the volume, while the\r\nAnalytical Index or _Catalogue Raisonne_, as the French would say, is the\r\nmost extended American fruit list ever published, and gives evidence of a\r\nfearful amount of labor.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nChapter    I.--INTRODUCTORY.\r\nChapter   II.--HISTORY OF THE APPLE.\r\nChapter  III.--PROPAGATION. - Buds and Cuttings--Grafting--Budding--The\r\nNursery.\r\nChapter   IV.--DWARFING.\r\nChapter    V.--DISEASES.\r\nChapter   VI.--THE SITE FOR AN ORCHARD.\r\nChapter  VII.--PREPARATION OF SOIL FOR AN ORCHARD.\r\nChapter VIII.--SELECTION AND PLANTING.\r\nChapter   IX.--CULTURE, Etc.\r\nChapter    X.--PHILOSOPHY OF PRUNING.\r\nChapter   XI.--THINNING.\r\nChapter  XII.--RIPENING AND PRESERVING FRUITS.\r\nChapter XIII and XIV.--INSECTS.\r\nChapter   XV.--CHARACTERS  OF  FRUITS  AND  THEIR VALUE--TERMS USED.\r\nChapter  XVI.--CLASSIFICATION. - Necessity for--Basis\r\nof--Characters--Shape--Its Regularity--Flavor--Color--Their several Values, etc.\r\nDescription of Apples.\r\nChapter XVII.--FRUIT LISTS--CATALOGUE AND INDEX OF FRUITS.\r\n\r\nSent Post-Paid.

In this work he has recorded this experience, and\r\ngiven, without reservation, the methods necessary to the profitable\r\nculture of the commercial or\r\n\r\nMARKET GARDEN.\r\n\r\nIt is a work for which there has long been a demand, and one which will\r\ncommend itself, not only to those who grow vegetables for sale, but to the\r\ncultivator of the\r\n\r\nFAMILY GARDEN,\r\n\r\nto whom it presents methods quite different from the old ones generally\r\npracticed. It is an ORIGINAL AND PURELY AMERICAN work, and not made up, as\r\nbooks on gardening too often are, by quotations from foreign authors.\r\n\r\nEvery thing is made perfectly plain, and the subject treated in all its\r\ndetails, from the selection of the soil to preparing the products for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nMen fitted for the Business of Gardening.\r\nThe Amount of Capital Required, and\r\nWorking Force per Acre.\r\nProfits of Market Gardening.\r\nLocation, Situation, and Laying Out.\r\nSoils, Drainage, and Preparation.\r\nManures, Implements.\r\nUses and Management of Cold Frames.\r\nFormation and Management of Hot-beds.\r\nForcing Pits or Green-houses.\r\nSeeds and Seed Raising.\r\nHow, When, and Where to Sow Seeds.\r\nTransplanting, Insects.\r\nPacking of Vegetables for Shipping.\r\nPreservation of Vegetables in Winter.\r\nVegetables, their Varieties and Cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter, the most valuable kinds are described, and the\r\nculture proper to each is given in detail.\r\n\r\nSent post-paid, price $1.50.\r\n\r\nORANGE JUDD & CO., 245 Broadway, New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL ANNUAL\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR 1870.\r\n\r\nA YEAR BOOK\r\n\r\nWANTED BY EVERY BODY.\r\n\r\nThis valuable Year Book has now reached its fourth number.

Puddled clay remains impervious as long as it is\r\n      saturated with water, and it does not entirely lose this quality\r\n      until it has been pulverized in a dry state.\r\n\r\n      A small proportion of clay is sufficient to injure the porousness of\r\n      the soil by puddling.--A clay subsoil is puddled by being plowed over\r\n      when too wet, and the injury is of considerable duration. Rain water\r\n      collected in hollows of stiff land, by the simple movement given it\r\n      by the wind, so puddles the surface that it holds the water while\r\n      the adjacent soil is dry and porous.\r\n\r\n      The term _puddling_ will often be used in this work, and the reader\r\n      will understand, from this explanation, the meaning with which it is\r\n      employed.\r\n\r\n    2 By leaving a space between the wall and the plastering, this\r\n      moisture is prevented from being an annoyance, and if the inclosed\r\n      space is not open from top to bottom, so as to allow a circulation\r\n      of air, but little vapor will come in contact with the wall, and but\r\n      an inconsiderable amount will be deposited.\r\n\r\n    3 The maps in this book are, for convenience, drawn to a scale of 160\r\n      feet to the inch.\r\n\r\n    4 The instrument from which this cut was taken, (as also Fig. 7) was\r\n      made by Messrs. Blunt & Nichols, Water st., N. Y.\r\n\r\n    5 The slight deviations caused by carrying the drains around large\r\n      stones, which are found in cutting the ditches, do not affect the\r\n      general arrangement of the lines.\r\n\r\n    6 The low price at which this instrument is sold, $1.50, places it\r\n      within the reach of all.\r\n\r\n    7 Except from quite near to the drain, it is not probable that the\r\n      water in the soil runs laterally towards it.\r\n\r\n    8 Some of the drains in the Central Park have a fall of only 1 in\r\n      1,000, and they work perfectly; but they are large mains, laid with\r\n      an amount of care, and with certain costly precautions, (including\r\n      precisely graded wooden floors,) which could hardly be expected in\r\n      private work.\r\n\r\n    9 The tile has been said, by great authorities, to be broken by\r\n      contraction, under some idea that the clay envelops the tile and\r\n      presses it when it contracts. That is nonsense. The contraction\r\n      would liberate the tile. Drive a stake into wet clay; and when the\r\n      clay is dry, observe whether it clasps the stake tighter or has\r\n      released it, and you will no longer have any doubt whether expansion\r\n      or contraction breaks the tile. Shrink is a better word than\r\n      contract.\r\n\r\n   10 Taking the difference of friction into consideration, 1-1/4 inch\r\n      pipes have fully twice the discharging capacity of 1-inch pipes.\r\n\r\n   11 No. 5 was one inch in diameter; No. 4, about 1-1/3 inches.\r\n\r\n   12 If the springs, when running at their greatest volume, be found to\r\n      require more than 1-1/4-inch tiles, due allowance must be made for\r\n      the increase.\r\n\r\n   13 Owing to the irregularity of the ground, and the necessity for\r\n      placing some of the drains at narrower intervals, the total length\r\n      of tile exceeds by nearly 50 per cent. what would be required if it\r\n      had a uniform slope, and required no collecting drains. It is much\r\n      greater than will be required in any ordinary case, as a very\r\n      irregular surface has been adopted here for purposes of\r\n      illustration.\r\n\r\n   14 The stakes used may be 18 inches long, and driven one-half of their\r\n      length into the ground. They should have one side sufficiently\r\n      smooth to be distinctly marked with red chalk.\r\n\r\n   15 The depth of 4.13, in Fig. 21, as well as the other depths at the\r\n      points at which the grade changes, happen to be those found by the\r\n      computation, as hereafter described, and they are used here for\r\n      illustration.\r\n\r\n   16 The figures in this table, as well as in the next preceding one, are\r\n      adopted for the published profile of drain _C_, Fig. 21, to avoid\r\n      confusion. In ordinary cases, the points which are fixed as the\r\n      basis of the computation are given in round numbers;--for instance,\r\n      the depth at _C3_ would be assumed to be 4.10 or 4.20, instead of\r\n      4.13. The fractions given in the table, and in Fig. 21, arise from\r\n      the fact that the decimals are not absolutely correct, being carried\r\n      out only for two figures.\r\n\r\n   17 The drains, which are removed a little to one side of the lines of\r\n      stakes, may be turned toward the basin from a distance of 3 or 4\r\n      feet.\r\n\r\n   18 The foot of the measuring rod should be shod with iron to prevent\r\n      its being worn to less than the proper length.\r\n\r\n   19 \"Talpa, or the Chronicles of a Clay Farm.\"\r\n\r\n   20 When chips of tile, or similar matters, are used to cover openings\r\n      in the tile-work, it is well to cover them at once with a mortar\r\n      made of wet clay, which will keep them in place until the ditches\r\n      are filled.\r\n\r\n   21 Surely such soil ought not to require thorough draining; where men\r\n      can go so easily, water ought to find its way alone.\r\n\r\n   22 The land shown in Fig. 21, is especially irregular, and, for the\r\n      purpose of illustrating the principles upon which the work should be\r\n      done, an effort has been made to make the work as complete as\r\n      possible in all particulars. In actual work on a field similar to\r\n      that, it would not probably be good economy to make all the drains\r\n      laid in the plan, but as deviations from the plan would depend on\r\n      conditions which cannot well be shown on such a small scale, they\r\n      are disregarded, and the system of drains is made as it would be if\r\n      it were all plain sailing.\r\n\r\n   23 Klippart's Land Drainage.\r\n\r\n   24 Klippart's Land Drainage.\r\n\r\n   25 Drainage des Terres Arables, Paris, 1856.\r\n\r\n   26 The ends of the work, while the operations are suspended during\r\n      spring tides, will need an extra protection of sods, but that lying\r\n      out of reach of the eddies that will be formed by the receding water\r\n      will not be materially affected.\r\n\r\n   27 The latest invention of this sort, is that of a series of cast iron\r\n      plates, set on edge, riveted together, and driven in to such a depth\r\n      as to reach from the top of the dyke to a point below low-water\r\n      mark. The best that can be said of this plan is, that its adoption\r\n      would do no harm. Unless the plates are driven deeply into the clay\r\n      underlying the permeable soil, (and this is sometimes very deep,)\r\n      they would not prevent the slight infiltration of water which could\r\n      pass under them as well as through any other part of the soil, and\r\n      unless the iron were very thick, the corrosive action of salt water\r\n      would soon so honeycomb it that the borers would easily penetrate\r\n      it; but the great objection to the use of these plates is, that they\r\n      would be very costly and ineffectual. A dyke, made as described\r\n      above, of the material of the locality, having a ditch only on the\r\n      inside, and being well sodded on its outer face, would be far\r\n      cheaper and better.",
