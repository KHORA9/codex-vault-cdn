His father and his grandfather before him were brewers, and the\r\nbusiness, in due course, descended to Mr. Joule and his elder brother,\r\nand by them was carried on with success till it was sold, in 1854.\r\nMr. Joule's grandfather came from Elton, in Derbyshire, settled near\r\nManchester, where he founded the business, and died at the age of\r\nfifty-four, in 1799. His father, one of a numerous family, married a\r\ndaughter of John Prescott of Wigan. They had five children, of\r\nwhom James Prescott Joule was the second, and of whom three were\r\nsons--Benjamin, the eldest, James, and John--and two daughters--Alice\r\nand Mary. Mr. Joule's mother died in 1836 at the age of forty-eight; and\r\nhis father, who was an invalid for many years before his death, died at\r\nthe age of seventy-four, in the year 1858.\r\n\r\nYoung Joule was a delicate child, and was not sent to school. His early\r\neducation was commenced by his mother's half sister, and was carried\r\non at his father's house, Broomhill, Pendlebury, by tutors till he was\r\nabout fifteen years of age. At fifteen he commenced working in the\r\nbrewery, which, as his father's health declined, fell entirely into the\r\nhands of his brother Benjamin and himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Joule obtained his first instruction in physical science from\r\nDalton, to whom his father sent the two brothers to learn chemistry.\r\nDalton, one of the most distinguished chemists of any age or country,\r\nwas then President of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society,\r\nand lived and received pupils in the rooms of the Society's house. Many\r\nof his most important memoirs were communicated to the Society, whose\r\n_Transactions_ are likewise enriched by a large number of communications\r\nfrom his distinguished pupil. Dalton's instruction to the two young men\r\ncommenced with arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. He then taught them\r\nnatural philosophy out of Cavallo's text-book, and afterward, but only\r\nfor a short time before his health gave way, in 1837, chemistry from his\r\nown \"New System of Chemical Philosophy.\" \"Profound, patient, intuitive,\"\r\nhis teaching must have had great influence on his pupils. We find Mr.\r\nJoule early at work on the molecular constitution of gases, following in\r\nthe footsteps of his illustrious master, whose own investigations on the\r\nconstitution of mixed gases, and on the behavior of vapors and gases\r\nunder heat, were among the most important of his day, and whose\r\nbrilliant discovery of the atomic theory revolutionized the science of\r\nchemistry and placed him at the head of the philosophical chemists of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES PRESCOTT JOULE.]\r\n\r\nUnder Dalton, Mr. Joule first became acquainted with physical apparatus;\r\nand the interest excited in his mind very soon began to produce fruit.\r\nAlmost immediately he commenced experimenting on his own account.\r\nObtaining a room in his father's house for the purpose, he began by\r\nconstructing a cylinder electric machine in a very primitive way. A\r\nglass tube served for the cylinder; a poker hung up by silk threads, as\r\nin the very oldest forms of electric machine, was the prime conductor;\r\nand for a Leyden jar he went back to the old historical jar of Cunaeus,\r\nand used a bottle half filled with water, standing in an outer vessel,\r\nwhich contained water also.\r\n\r\nEnlarging his stock of apparatus, chiefly by the work of his own hands,\r\nhe soon entered the ranks as an investigator, and original papers\r\nfollowed each other in quick succession. The Royal Society list now\r\ncontains, the titles of ninety-seven papers due to Joule, exclusive of\r\nover twenty very important papers detailing researches undertaken by him\r\nconjointly with Thomson, with Lyon Playfair, and with Scoresby.\r\n\r\nMr. Joule's first investigations were in the field of magnetism. In\r\n1838, at the age of nineteen, he constructed an electro-magnetic engine,\r\nwhich he described in Sturgeon's \"Annals of Electricity\" for January\r\nof that year. In the same year, and in the three years following, he\r\nconstructed other electro-magnetic machines and electro-magnets of novel\r\nforms; and experimenting with the new apparatus, he obtained results\r\nof great importance in the theory of electro-magnetism. In 1840 he\r\ndiscovered and determined the value of the limit to the magnetization\r\ncommunicable to soft iron by the electric current; showing for the case\r\nof an electro-magnet supporting weight, that when the exciting current\r\nis made stronger and stronger, the sustaining power tends to a certain\r\ndefinite limit, which, according to his estimate, amounts to about\r\n140 lb. per square inch of either of the attracting surfaces.\r\nHe investigated the relative values of solid iron cores for the\r\nelectro-magnetic machine, as compared with bundles of iron wire; and,\r\napplying the principles which he had discovered, he proceeded to the\r\nconstruction of electro-magnets of much greater lifting power than any\r\npreviously made, while he studied also the methods of modifying the\r\ndistribution of the force in the magnetic field.\r\n\r\nIn commencing these investigations he was met at the very outset, as he\r\ntells us, with \"the difficulty, if not impossibility, of understanding\r\nexperiments and comparing them with one another, which arises in general\r\nfrom incomplete descriptions of apparatus, and from the arbitrary and\r\nvague numbers which are used to characterize electric currents. Such a\r\npractice,\" he says, \"might be tolerated in the infancy of science; but\r\nin its present state of advancement greater precision and propriety are\r\nimperatively demanded. I have therefore determined,\" he continues,\r\n\"for my own part to abandon my old quantity numbers, and to express my\r\nresults on the basis of a unit which shall be at once scientific and\r\nconvenient.\"\r\n\r\nThe discovery by Faraday of the law of electro-chemical equivalents\r\nhad induced him to propose the voltameter as a measurer of electric\r\ncurrents, but the system proposed had not been used in the researches\r\nof any electrician, not excepting those of Faraday himself. Joule,\r\nrealizing for the first time the importance of having a system of\r\nelectric measurement which would make experimental results obtained\r\nat different times and under various circumstances comparable among\r\nthemselves, and perceiving at the same time the advantages of a system\r\nof electric measurement dependent on, or at any rate comparable with,\r\nthe chemical action producing the electric current, adopted as unit\r\nquantity of electricity the quantity required to decompose nine grains\r\nof water, 9 being the atomic weight of water, according to the chemical\r\nnomenclature then in use.\r\n\r\nHe had already made and described very important improvements in the\r\nconstruction of galvanometers, and he graduated his tangent galvanometer\r\nto correspond with the system of electric measurement he had adopted.\r\nThe electric currents used in his experiments were thenceforth measured\r\non the new system; and the numbers given in Joule's papers from 1840\r\ndownward are easily reducible to the modern absolute system of electric\r\nmeasurements, in the construction and general introduction of which\r\nhe himself took so prominent a part. It was in 1840, also, that after\r\nexperimenting on improvements in voltaic apparatus, he turned his\r\nattention to \"the heat evolved by metallic conductors of electricity and\r\nin the cells of a battery during electrolysis.\" In this paper, and those\r\nfollowing it in 1841 and 1842, he laid the foundation of a new province\r\nin physical science-electric and chemical thermodynamics-then totally\r\nunknown, but now wonderfully familiar, even to the roughest common sense\r\npractical electrician. With regard to the heat evolved by a metallic\r\nconductor carrying an electric current, he established what was already\r\nsupposed to be the law, namely, that \"the quantity of heat evolved by\r\nit [in a given time] is always proportional to the resistance which it\r\npresents, whatever may be the length, thickness, shape, or kind of the\r\nmetallic conductor,\" while he obtained the law, then unknown, that\r\nthe heat evolved is proportional to the _square_ of the quantity of\r\nelectricity passing in a given time. Corresponding laws were established\r\nfor the heat evolved by the current passing in the electrolytic cell,\r\nand likewise for the heat developed in the cells of the battery itself.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1840 he was already speculating on the transformation of\r\nchemical energy into heat. In the paper last referred to and in a short\r\nabstract in the _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, December, 1840, he\r\npoints out that the heat generated in a wire conveying a current of\r\nelectricity is a part of the heat of chemical combination of the\r\nmaterials used in the voltaic cell, and that the remainder, not the\r\nwhole heat of combination, is evolved within the cell in which the\r\nchemical action takes place. In papers given in 1841 and 1842, he pushes\r\nhis investigations further, and shows that the sum of the heat produced\r\nin all parts of the circuit during voltaic action is proportional to the\r\nchemical action that goes on in the voltaic pile, and again, that the\r\nquantities of heat which are evolved by the combustion of equivalents\r\nof bodies are proportional to the intensities of their affinities for\r\noxygen. Having proceeded thus far, he carried on the same train of\r\nreasoning and experiment till he was able to announce in January, 1843,\r\nthat the magneto-electric machine enables us to _convert mechanical\r\npower into heat_. Most of his spare time in the early part of the year\r\n1843 was devoted to making experiments necessary for the discovery of\r\nthe laws of the development of heat by magneto-electricity, and for the\r\ndefinite determination of the mechanical value of heat.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the British Association at Cork, on August 21, 1843,\r\nhe read his paper \"On the Calorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity,\r\nand on the Mechanical Value of Heat.\" The paper gives an account of an\r\nadmirable series of experiments, proving that _heat is generated_ (not\r\nmerely _transferred_ from some source) by the magneto-electric machine.\r\nThe investigation was pushed on for the purpose of finding whether a\r\n_constant ratio exists between the heat generated and the mechanical\r\npower_ used in its production. As the result of one set of\r\nmagneto-electric experiments, he finds 838 foot pounds to be the\r\nmechanical equivalent of the quantity of heat capable of increasing the\r\ntemperature of one pound of water by one degree of Fahrenheit's scale.\r\nThe paper is dated Broomhill, July, 1843, but a postscript, dated\r\nAugust, 1843, contains the following sentences:\r\n\r\n\"We shall be obliged to admit that Count Rumford was right in\r\nattributing the heat evolved by boring cannon to friction, and not (in\r\nany considerable degree) to any change in the capacity of the metal. I\r\nhave lately proved experimentally that _heat is evolved by the passage\r\nof water through narrow tubes_. My apparatus consisted of a piston\r\nperforated by a number of small holes, working in a cylindrical glass\r\njar containing about 7 lb. of water. I thus obtained one degree of heat\r\nper pound of water from a mechanical force capable of raising about 770\r\nlb. to the height of one foot, a result which will be allowed to be very\r\nstrongly confirmatory of our previous deductions. I shall lose no time\r\nin repeating and extending these experiments, being satisfied that the\r\ngrand agents of nature are, by the Creator's fiat, _indestructible_, and\r\nthat wherever mechanical force is expended, an exact equivalent of heat\r\nis _always_ obtained.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first determination of the dynamical equivalent of heat.\r\nOther naturalists and experimenters about the same time were attempting\r\nto compare the quantity of heat produced under certain circumstances\r\nwith the quantity of work expended in producing it; and results and\r\ndeductions (some of them very remarkable) were given by Séguin (1839),\r\nMayer (1842), Colding (1843), founded partly on experiment, and partly\r\non a kind of metaphysical reasoning. It was Joule, however, who first\r\ndefinitely proposed the problem of determining the relation between heat\r\nproduced and work done in any mechanical action, and solved the problem\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that Joule's discovery and the results of his\r\ninvestigation met with immediate attention or with ready acquiescence.\r\nThe problem occupied him almost continuously for many years; and in 1878\r\nhe gives in the _Philosophical Transactions_ the results of a fresh\r\ndetermination, according to which the quantity of work required to be\r\nexpended in order to raise the temperature of one pound of water weighed\r\nin vacuum from 60° to 61° Fahr., is 772.55 foot pounds of work at the\r\nsea level and in the latitude of Greenwich. His results of 1849 and 1878\r\nagree in a striking manner with those obtained by Hirn and with those\r\nderived from an elaborate series of experiments carried out by Prof.\r\nRowland, at the expense of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nHis experiments subsequent to 1843 on the dynamical equivalent of\r\nheat must be mentioned briefly. In that year his father removed from\r\nPendlebury to Oak Field, Whalley Range, on the south side of Manchester,\r\nand built for his son a convenient laboratory near to the house. It was\r\nat this time that he felt the pressing need of accurate thermometers;\r\nand while Regnault was doing the same thing in France, Mr. Joule\r\nproduced, with the assistance of Mr. Dancer, instrument maker, of\r\nManchester, the first English thermometers possessing such accuracy\r\nas the mercury-in-glass thermometer is capable of. Some of them were\r\nforwarded to Prof. Graham and to Prof. Lyon Playfair; and the production\r\nof these instruments was in itself a most important contribution to\r\nscientific equipment.\r\n\r\nAs the direct experiment of friction of a fluid is dependent on no\r\nhypothesis, and appears to be wholly unexceptionable, it was used by Mr.\r\nJoule repeatedly in modified forms. The stirring of mercury, of oil,\r\nand of water with a paddle, which was turned by a falling weight,\r\nwas compared, and solid friction, the friction of iron on iron under\r\nmercury, was tried; but the simple stirring of water seemed preferable\r\nto any, and was employed in all his later determinations.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Mr. Joule was married to Amelia, daughter of Mr. John Grimes,\r\nComptroller of Customs, Liverpool. His wife died early (1854), leaving\r\nhim one son and one daughter.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the British Association at Oxford, in this year, proved\r\nan interesting and important one. Here Joule read a fresh paper \"On the\r\nMechanical Equivalent of Heat.\" Of this meeting Sir William Thomson\r\nwrites as follows to the author of this notice:\r\n\r\n\"I made Joule's acquaintance at the Oxford meeting, and it quickly\r\nripened into a lifelong friendship.\r\n\r\n\"I heard his paper read in the section, and felt strongly impelled at\r\nfirst to rise and say that it must be wrong, because the true mechanical\r\nvalue of heat given, suppose in warm water, must, for small differences\r\nof temperature, be proportional to the square of its quantity. I knew\r\nfrom Carnot that this _must_ be true (and it _is_ true; only now I call\r\nit 'motivity,' to avoid clashing with Joule's 'mechanical value'). But\r\nas I listened on and on, I saw that (though Carnot had vitally important\r\ntruth, not to be abandoned) Joule had certainly a great truth and a\r\ngreat discovery, and a most important measurement to bring forward. So,\r\ninstead of rising, with my objection, to the meeting, I waited till it\r\nwas over, and said my say to Joule himself, at the end of the meeting.\r\nThis made my first introduction to him. After that I had a long talk\r\nover the whole matter at one of the _conversaziones_ of the Association,\r\nand we became fast friends from thenceforward. However, he did not tell\r\nme he was to be married in a week or so; but about a fortnight later I\r\nwas walking down from Chamounix to commence the tour of Mont Blanc, and\r\nwhom should I meet walking up but Joule, with a long thermometer in his\r\nhand, and a carriage with a lady in it not far off. He told me he had\r\nbeen married since we had parted at Oxford! and he was going to try for\r\nelevation of temperature in waterfalls. We trysted to meet a few days\r\nlater at Martigny, and look at the Cascade de Sallanches, to see if it\r\nmight answer. We found it too much broken into spray. His young wife, as\r\nlong as she lived, took complete interest in his scientific work, and\r\nboth she and he showed me the greatest kindness during my visits to them\r\nin Manchester for our experiments on the thermal effects of fluid in\r\nmotion, which we commenced a few years later\"\r\n\r\n\"Joule's paper at the Oxford meeting made a great sensation. Faraday was\r\nthere and was much struck with it, but did not enter fully into the new\r\nviews. It was many years after that before any of the scientific chiefs\r\nbegan to give their adhesion. It was not long after, when Stokes told me\r\nhe was inclined to be a Joulite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miller, or Graham, or both, were for years quite incredulous as to\r\nJoule's results, because they all depended on fractions of a degree of\r\ntemperature--sometimes very small fractions. His boldness in making such\r\nlarge conclusions from such very small observational effects is almost\r\nas noteworthy and admirable as his skill in extorting accuracy from\r\nthem. I remember distinctly at the Royal Society, I think it was either\r\nGraham or Miller, saying simply he did not believe Joule, because he had\r\nnothing but hundredths of a degree to prove his case by.\"\r\n\r\nThe friendship formed between Joule and Thomson in 1847 grew rapidly.\r\nA voluminous correspondence was kept up between them, and several\r\nimportant researches were undertaken by the two friends in common. Their\r\nfirst joint research was on the thermal effects experienced by air\r\nrushing through small apertures The results of this investigation give\r\nfor the first time an experimental basis for the hypothesis assumed\r\nwithout proof by Mayer as the foundation for an estimate of the\r\nnumerical relation between quantities of heat and mechanical work, and\r\nthey show that for permanent gases the hypothesis is very approximately\r\ntrue. Subsequently, Joule and Thomson undertook more comprehensive\r\ninvestigations on the thermal effects of fluids in motion, and on the\r\nheat acquired by bodies moving rapidly through the air. They found the\r\nheat generated by a body moving at one mile per second through the air\r\nsufficient to account for its ignition. The phenomena of \"shooting\r\nstars\" were explained by Mr. Joule in 1847 by the heat developed by\r\nbodies rushing into our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within the limits to which this sketch is necessarily\r\nconfined to speak in detail of the many researches undertaken by Mr.\r\nJoule on various physical subjects. Even of the most interesting of\r\nthese a very brief notice must suffice for the present.\r\n\r\nMolecular physics, as I have already remarked, early claimed his\r\nattention. Various papers on electrolysis of liquids, and on the\r\nconstitution of gases, have been the result. A very interesting paper\r\non \"Heat and the Constitution of Elastic Fluids\" was read before\r\nthe Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1848. In it he\r\ndeveloped Daniel Bernoulli's explanation of air pressure by the impact\r\nof the molecules of the gas on the sides of the vessel which contains\r\nit, and from very simple considerations he calculated the average\r\nvelocity of the particles requisite to produce ordinary atmospheric\r\npressure at different temperatures. The average velocity of the\r\nparticles of hydrogen at 32° F. he found to be 6,055 feet per second,\r\nthe velocities at various temperatures being proportional to the square\r\nroots of the numbers which express those temperatures on the absolute\r\nthermodynamic scale.\r\n\r\nHis contribution to the theory of the velocity of sound in air was\r\nlikewise of great importance, and is distinguished alike for the\r\nacuteness of his explanations of the existing causes of error in the\r\nwork of previous experimenters, and for the accuracy, so far as\r\nwas required for the purpose in hand, of his own experiments. His\r\ndetermination of the specific heat of air, pressure constant, and the\r\nspecific heat of air, volume constant, furnished the data necessary for\r\nmaking Laplace's theoretical velocity agree with the velocity of sound\r\nexperimentally determined. On the other hand, he was able to account\r\nfor most puzzling discrepancies, which appeared in attempted direct\r\ndeterminations of the differences between the two specific heats by\r\ncareful experimenters. He pointed out that in experiments in which air\r\nwas allowed to rush violently or _explode_ into a vacuum, there was a\r\nsource of loss of energy that no one had taken account of, namely,\r\nin the sound produced by the explosion. Hence in the most careful\r\nexperiments, where the vacuum was made as perfect as possible, and the\r\nexplosion correspondingly the more violent, the results were actually\r\nthe worst. With his explanations, the theory of the subject was rendered\r\nquite complete.\r\n\r\nSpace fails, or I should mention in detail Mr. Joule's experiments on\r\nmagnetism and electro-magnets, referred to at the commencement of this\r\nsketch. He discovered the now celebrated change of dimensions produced\r\nby the magnetization of soft iron by the current. The peculiar noise\r\nwhich accompanies the magnetization of an iron bar by the current,\r\nsometimes called the \"magnetic tick,\" was thus explained.\r\n\r\nMr. Joule's improvements in galvanometers have already been incidentally\r\nmentioned, and the construction by him of accurate thermometers has been\r\nreferred to. It should never be forgotten that _he first_ used small\r\nenough needles in tangent galvanometers to practically annul error from\r\nwant of uniformity of the magnetic field. Of other improvements and\r\nadditions to philosophical instruments may be mentioned a thermometer,\r\nunaffected by radiation, for measuring the temperature of the\r\natmosphere, an improved barometer, a mercurial vacuum pump, one of the\r\nvery first of the species which is now doing such valuable work, not\r\nonly in scientific laboratories, but in the manufacture of incandescent\r\nelectric lamps, and an apparatus for determining the earth's horizontal\r\nmagnetic force in absolute measure.\r\n\r\nHere this imperfect sketch must close. My limits are already passed. Mr.\r\nJoule has never been in any sense a public man; and, of those who know\r\nhis name as that of the discoverer who has given the experimental basis\r\nfor the grandest generalization in the whole of physical science, very\r\nfew have ever seen his face. Of his private character this is scarcely\r\nthe place to speak. Mr. Joule is still among us. May he long be spared\r\nto work for that cause to which he has given his life with heart-whole\r\ndevotion that has never been excelled.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1878, he received a letter from the Earl of Beaconsfield\r\nannouncing to him that Her Majesty the Queen had been pleased to grant\r\nhim a pension of £200 per annum. This recognition of his labors by his\r\ncountry was a subject of much gratification to Mr. Joule.\r\n\r\nMr. Joule received the Gold Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1852,\r\nthe Copley Gold Medal of the Royal Society in 1870, and the Albert Medal\r\nof the Society of Arts from the hand of the Prince of Wales in 1880.\r\n\r\nJ. T. BOTTOMLEY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK CANALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent adoption of the constitutional amendment abolishing tolls on\r\nthe canals of New York State has revived interest in these water ways.\r\nThe overwhelming majority by which the measure was passed shows, says\r\nthe _Glassware Reporter_, that the people are willing to bear the cost\r\nof their management by defraying from the public treasury all expenses\r\nincident to their operation. That the abolition of the toll system will\r\nbe a great gain to the State seems to be admitted by nearly everybody,\r\nand the measure met with but little opposition except from the railroad\r\ncorporations and their supporters.\r\n\r\nAt as early a date as the close of the Revolutionary War, Mr. Morris had\r\nsuggested the union of the great lakes with the Hudson River, and in\r\n1812 he again advocated it. De Witt Clinton, of New York, one of the\r\nmost, valuable men of his day, took up the idea, and brought the leading\r\nmen of his State to lend him their support in pushing it. To dig a\r\ncanal all the way from Albany to Lake Erie was a pretty formidable\r\nundertaking; the State of New York accordingly invited the Federal\r\ngovernment to assist in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe canal was as desirable on national grounds as on any other, but the\r\nproposition met with a rebuff, and the Empire State then resolved to\r\nbuild the canal herself. Surveyors were sent out to locate a line for\r\nit, and on July 4, 1817, ground was broken for the canal by De Witt\r\nClinton, who was then Governor of the State.\r\n\r\nThe main line, from Albany, on the Hudson, to Buffalo, on Lake Erie,\r\nmeasures 363 miles in length, and cost $7,143,789. The Champlain,\r\nOswego, Chemung, Cayuga, and Crooked Lake canals, and some others, join\r\nthe main line, and, including these branch lines, it measures 543 miles\r\nin length, and cost upward of $11,500,000. This canal was originally 40\r\nfeet in breadth at the water line, 28 feet at the bottom, and 4 feet in\r\ndepth. Its dimensions proved too small for the extensive trade which it\r\nhad to support, and the depth of water was increased to 7 feet, and the\r\nextreme breadth of the canal to 60 feet. There are 84 locks on the main\r\nline. These locks, originally 90 feet in length and 15 in breadth, and\r\nwith an average lift of 8 feet 2 inches, have since been much enlarged.\r\nThe total rise and fall is 692 feet. The towpath is elevated 4 feet\r\nabove the level of the water, and is 10 feet in breadth. At Lockport the\r\ncanal descends 60 feet by means of 5 locks excavated in solid rock, and\r\nafterward proceeds on a uniform level for a distance of 63 miles to the\r\nGenesee River, over which it is carried on an aqueduct having 9 arches\r\nof 50 feet span each. Eight and a half miles from this point it passes\r\nover the Cayuga marsh, on an embankment 2 miles in length, and in some\r\nplaces 70 feet in height. At Syracuse, the \"long level\" commences, which\r\nextends for a distance of 69½ miles to Frankfort, without an intervening\r\nlock. After leaving Frankfort, the canal crosses the river Mohawk, first\r\nby an aqueduct 748 feet in length, supported on 16 piers, elevated 25\r\nfeet above the surface of the river, and afterward by another aqueduct\r\n1,188 feet in length, and emerges into the Hudson at Albany.\r\n\r\nThis great work was finished in 1825, and its completion was the\r\noccasion of great public rejoicing. The same year that the Erie Canal\r\nwas begun, ground was broken for a canal from Lake Champlain to the\r\nHudson, sixty-three miles in length. This work was completed in 1823.\r\n\r\nThe construction of these two water ways was attended with the most\r\ninteresting consequences. Even before they were completed their value\r\nhad become clearly apparent. Boats were placed upon the Erie Canal as\r\nfast as the different levels were ready for use, and set to work in\r\nactive transportation. They were small affairs compared with those of\r\nthe present day, being about 50 or 60 tons burden, the modern canal boat\r\nbeing 180 or 200 tons. Small as they were, they reduced the cost of\r\ntransportation immediately to one-tenth what it had been before. A ton\r\nof freight by land from Buffalo to Albany cost at that time $100. When\r\nthe canal was open its entire length, the cost of freight fell from\r\nfifteen to twenty-five dollars a ton, according to the class of article\r\ncarried; and the time of transit from 20 to 8 days, Wheat at that time\r\nwas worth only $33 a ton in western New York, and it did not pay to send\r\nit by land to New York. When sent to market at all, it was floated down\r\nthe Susquehanna to Baltimore, as being the cheapest and best market.\r\nThe canal changed that. It now became possible to send to market a wide\r\nvariety of agricultural produce--fruit, grain, vegetables, etc.--which,\r\nbefore the canal was built, either had no value at all, or which could\r\nbe disposed of to no good advantage. It is claimed by the original\r\npromoters of the Erie Canal, who lived to see its beneficial effects\r\nexperienced by the people of the country, that their work, costing less\r\nthan $8.000,000 and paying its whole cost of construction in a very\r\nfew years, added $100,000,000 to the value of the farms of New York by\r\nopening up good and ready markets for their products. The canal had\r\nanother result. It made New York city the commercial metropolis of the\r\ncountry. An old letter, written by a resident of Newport, R. I., in that\r\nage, has lately been discovered, which speaks of New York city, and\r\nsays: \"If we do not look out, New York will get ahead of us.\" Newport\r\nwas then one of the principal seaports of the country; it had once been\r\nthe first. New York city certainly did \"get ahead of us\" after the Erie\r\nCanal was built. It got ahead of every other commercial city on the\r\ncoast. Freight, which had previously gone overland from Ohio and the\r\nWest to Pittsburg, and thence to Philadelphia, costing $120 a ton\r\nbetween the two cities named, now went to New York by way of the Hudson\r\nRiver and the Erie Canal and the lakes. Manufactures and groceries\r\nreturned to the West by the same route, and New York became a\r\nflourishing and growing emporium immediately. The Erie Canal was\r\nenlarged in 1835, so as to permit the passage of boats of 100 tons\r\nburden, and the result was a still further reduction of the cost of\r\nfreighting, expansion of traffic, and an increase of the general\r\nbenefits conferred by the canal. The Champlain Canal had an effect upon\r\nthe farms and towns lying along Lake Champlain, in Vermont and New York,\r\nkindred in character to that above described in respect to the Erie\r\nCanal. It brought into the market lands and produce which before had\r\nbeen worthless, and was a great blessing to all concerned.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the building of the Erie Canal was the wisest\r\nand most far-seeing enterprise of the age. It has left a permanent and\r\nindelible mark upon the face of the republic of the United States in the\r\ngreat communities it has directly assisted to build up at the West, and\r\nin the populous metropolis it created at the mouth of the Hudson River.\r\nNone of the canals which have been built to compete with it have yet\r\nsucceeded in regaining for their States what was lost to them when the\r\nErie Canal went into operation. This water route is still the most\r\nimportant artificial one of its class in the country, and is only\r\nequaled by the Welland Canal in Canada, which is its closest rival. Now\r\nthat it is free, it will retain its position as the most popular water\r\nroute to the sea from the great West. The Mississippi River will divert\r\nfrom it all the trade flowing to South America and Mexico; but for the\r\nnorthwest it will be the chief water highway to the ocean.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTRAU'S LOCOMOTIVE FOR ASCENDING STEEP GRADES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe borrow, from our contemporary _La Nature_, the annexed figure,\r\nillustrating an ingenious type of locomotive designed for equally\r\nefficient use on both level surfaces and heavy grades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTRAU'S LOCOMOTIVE FOR ASCENDING STEEP GRADES.]\r\n\r\nAs well known, all the engines employed on level roads are provided with\r\nlarge driving wheels, which, although they have a comparatively feeble\r\ntractive power, afford a high speed, while, on the contrary, those that\r\nare used for ascending heavy grades have small wheels that move slowly,\r\nbut possess, as an offset, a tractive power that enables them to\r\novercome the resistances of gravity.\r\n\r\nM. Cottrau's engine possesses the qualities of both these types, since\r\nit is provided with wheels of large and small diameter, that may be used\r\nat will. These two sets of wheels, as may be seen from the figure, are\r\narranged on the same driving axle. The large wheels are held apart\r\nthe width of the ordinary track, while the small wheels are placed\r\ninternally, or as in the case represented in the figure, externally.\r\nThese two sets of wheels, being fixed solidly to the same axle, revolve\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOn level surfaces the engine rests on the large wheels, which revolve\r\nin contact with the rails of the ordinary track, and it then runs with\r\ngreat speed, while the auxiliary wheels revolve to no purpose. On\r\nreaching an ascent, on the contrary, the engine meets with an elevated\r\ntrack external or internal to the ordinary one, and which engages with\r\nthe auxiliary wheels. The large wheels are then lifted off the ordinary\r\ntrack and revolve to no purpose. In both cases, the engine is placed\r\nunder conditions as advantageous as are those that are built especially\r\nfor the two types of roads. The idea appears to be a very ingenious one,\r\nand can certainly be carried out without disturbing the working of the\r\nlocomotive. In fact, the same number of piston strokes per minute may\r\nbe preserved in the two modes of running, so as to reduce the speed in\r\nascending, in proportion to the diameters of the wheels. There will thus\r\noccur the same consumption of steam. On another hand, there is nothing\r\nto prevent the boiler from keeping up the same production of steam, for\r\nit has been ascertained by experience, on the majority of railways, that\r\nthe speed of running has no influence on vaporization, and that the same\r\nfigures may be allowed for passenger as for freight locomotives.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of construction that will be met with in the\r\nengine under consideration will be connected with the placing of the\r\ndouble wheels, which will reduce the already limited space at one's\r\ndisposal, and with the necessity that there will be of strengthening all\r\nthe parts of the mechanism that are to be submitted to strain.\r\n\r\nThe installation of the auxiliary track will also prove a peculiarly\r\ndelicate matter; and, to prevent accidents, some means will have to be\r\ndevised that will permit the auxiliary wheels to engage with this\r\ntrack very gradually. Still, these difficulties are perhaps not\r\ninsurmountable, and if M. Cottrau's ingenious arrangement meets with\r\nfinal success in practice, it will find numerous applications.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACHMANN'S STEAM DRIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus shown in the annexed cuts is capable of effecting a\r\ncertain amount of saving in the fuel of a generator, and of securing a\r\nnormal operation in a steam engine. If occasion does not occur to blow\r\noff the motive cylinder frequently, the water that is carried over\r\nmechanically by the steam, or that is produced through condensation in\r\nthe pipes, accumulates therein and leaks through the joints of the cocks\r\nand valves. This is one of the causes that diminish the performance of\r\nthe motor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACHMANN'S STEAM DRIER. FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe steam drier under consideration has been devised by Mr. Bachmann\r\nfor the purpose of doing away with such inconveniences. When applied to\r\napparatus employed in heating, for cooking, for work in a vacuum, it may\r\nbe affixed to the pipe at the very place where the steam is utilized, so\r\nas to draw off all the water from the mixture.\r\n\r\nAs shown by the arrows in Fig 1, the steam enters through the orifice,\r\nD, along with the water that it carries, gives up the latter at P, and\r\nis completely dried at the exit, R. The partition, g, is so arranged\r\nas to diminish the section of the steam pipe, in order to increase the\r\neffect of the gravity that brings about the separation of the mixture.\r\nThe water that falls into the space, P, is exhausted either by means of\r\na discharge cock (Fig. 1), which gives passage to the liquid only, or\r\nby the aid of an automatic purge-cock (Figs. 2 and 3), the locating of\r\nwhich varies with the system employed. This arrangement is preferable\r\nto the other, since it permits of expelling the water deposited in the\r\nreceptacle, P, without necessitating any attention on the part of the\r\nengine-man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH.S. PARMELEE'S PATENT AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inventor says: \"The automatic sprinkler is a device for\r\nautomatically extinguishing fires through the release of water by means\r\nof the heat of the fire, the water escaping in a shower, which is thrown\r\nin all directions to a distance of from six to eight feet. The sprinkler\r\nis a light brass rose, about 1½ inches diameter and less than two inches\r\nhigh entire, the distributer being a revolving head fitted loosely to\r\nthe body of the fixed portion, which is made to screw into a half inch\r\ntube connection. The revolution of the distributer is effected by the\r\nresistance the water meets in escaping through slots cut at an angle\r\nin the head. The distribution of water has been found to be the most\r\nperfect from this arrangement. Now, this distributing head is covered\r\nover with a brass cap, which is soldered to the base beneath with an\r\nalloy which melts at from 155 to 160 degrees. No water can escape until\r\nthe cap is removed. The heat of an insignificant fire is sufficient to\r\neffect this, and we have the practical prevention of any serious damage\r\nor loss through the multiplication of the sprinkler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARMELEE'S PATENT AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER. FIG. 1.--Section\r\nof Sprinkler with Cap on.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed engravings represent the sprinkler at exact size for\r\none-half inch connection. Fig. 1 shows a section with the cap covering\r\nover the sprinkler, and soldered on to the base. Fig. 2 shows the\r\nsprinkler with the cap off, which, of course, leaves the water free to\r\nrun from the holes in fine spray in all directions. Fig. 1 shows the\r\nbase hollowed out so as to allow the heat to circulate in between the\r\npipe and the base of the sprinkler, thus allowing the heat to operate on\r\nthe _inside_ as well as on the outside of the sprinkler; thus, in case\r\nof fire, it is very quickly heated through sufficiently to melt the\r\nfusible solder. These sprinklers are all tested at 500 lb., consequently\r\nthey can never leak, and cannot possibly be opened, except by heat,\r\nby any one. As the entire sprinkler is covered by a heavy brass cap,\r\nsoldered on, it cannot by any means be injured, nor can the openings in\r\nthe revolving head ever become filled with dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARMELEE'S PATENT AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER. FIG.2--Sprinkler\r\nwith cap off.]\r\n\r\nIt is so simple as to be easily understood by any one. As soon as the\r\nsprinkler becomes heated to 155 degrees, the cap will become unsoldered,\r\nand will then immediately be blown entirely off by the force of the\r\nwater in the pipes and sprinkler. These caps cannot remain on after\r\nthe fusible metal melts, if there is the least force of water. A man's\r\nbreath is sufficient to blow them off.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement commences with one or more main supply pipes, either fed\r\nfrom a city water pipe or from a tank, as the situation will admit.\r\nIf desired, the tank need only be of sufficient size to feed a few\r\nsprinklers for a short time, and then dependence must be placed upon\r\na pump for a further supply of water, if necessary. The tank, however\r\nsmall, will insure the automatic and prompt working of the sprinklers\r\nand alarm, and by the time the tank shall become empty the pumps can\r\nbe got at work. It is most desirable, however, in all cases to have an\r\nabundant water supply without resorting to pumps, if it is possible.\r\n\r\nIn the main supply pipe or pipes is placed our patent alarm valve,\r\nwhich, as soon as there is any motion of the water in the pipe, opens,\r\nand moves a lever, which, by connecting with a steam whistle valve by\r\nmeans of a wire, will blow the whistle and will continue to do so until\r\neither the steam or the water is stopped. Tins constitutes the alarm,\r\nand is positive in its motion. No water can possibly flow from the line\r\nof pipes without opening this valve and blowing the whistle. We also put\r\nin an automatic alarm bell when desired.\r\n\r\nFrom the main pipe other pipes are run, generally lengthways of the\r\nbuilding, ten feet from each side and twenty feet apart. At every ten\r\nfeet on these pipes we place five feet of three-quarter inch pipe,\r\nreaching each side, at the end of which is placed the sprinkler in an\r\nelbow pointing toward the ceiling. This arrangement is as we place them\r\nin all cotton and woolen mills, but may be varied to suit different\r\nstyles of buildings.\r\n\r\nThe sprinkler is made of brass, and has a revolving head, with four\r\nslots, from which the water flies in a very fine and dense spray on\r\neverything, and filling the air very completely for a radius of seven or\r\neight feet all around; thus rendering the existence of any fire in that\r\nspace perfectly impossible; and as the sprinklers are only placed ten\r\nfeet apart, and a fire cannot start at a greater distance than from five\r\nto six feet from one or more of them, it is assured that all parts of a\r\nbuilding are fully protected.\r\n\r\nOver each one of these sprinklers is placed a brass cap, which fits\r\nclosely over and passes below the base, where it is soldered on with a\r\nfusible metal that melts as soon as it is heated to 155 degrees.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a fire starts in any part of a building, heat will be\r\ngenerated and immediately rise toward the ceiling, and the sprinkler\r\nnearest the fire will become heated in a very few moments to the\r\nrequired 155 degrees, when the cap will become loosened and will be\r\nforced off by the power of the water. The water will then be spread in\r\nfine spray on the ceiling over the fire, also directly on the fire and\r\nall around for a diameter of from fourteen to eighteen feet. This spray\r\nhas been fully tried, and it is found to be entirely sufficient to\r\nextinguish any fire within its reach which can be made of any ordinary\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cap on any sprinkler becomes loosened by the heat of a\r\nfire and is forced off, a current of water is produced in the main pipe\r\nwhere the alarm valve is placed, and as the passage through it is dosed,\r\nthe water cannot pass without opening the valve and thus moving the\r\nlever to which the steam whistle valve is attached; by this motion the\r\nwhistle valve is opened, and the whistle will blow until it is stopped\r\nby some one.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENT FOR DRAWING CONVERGING STRAIGHT LINES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Paper by Prof. Fr. Smigaglia, read at the reunion of the\r\nEngineers and Architects of Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LET A and B be two fixed points and A C and C B two straight lines\r\nconverging at C and moving in their plane so as to always remain based\r\non this point (Fig. 1). The geometrical place of the positions occupied\r\nby C is the circumference of the circle which passes through the three\r\npoints A, B, and C. Now let C F be a straight line passing through C. On\r\nprolonging it, it will meet the circumference A C B I at a point I. If\r\nthe system of three converging--lines takes a new position A C' F B,\r\nit is evident F' B' prolonged will pass through I, because the angles\r\n[alpha] and [beta] are invariable for any position whatever of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n2. In the particular case in which [alpha] = [beta] (Fig. 2), the point\r\nI is found at the extremity of the diameter, and, consequently, for a\r\ngiven distance A B, or for a given length C D, such point will be at its\r\nmaximum distance from C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n3. This granted, it is easy to construct an instrument suitable for\r\ndrawing converging lines which shall prove useful to all those who have\r\nto do with practical perspective. For this purpose it is only necessary\r\nto take three rulers united at C (Fig. 3), to rest the two A C and C B\r\nagainst two points or needles A and B, and to draw the lines with the\r\nruler C F, in placing the system (§ 1) in all positions possible. The\r\nthree rulers may be inclined in any way whatever toward each other, but\r\n(§ 2) it is preferable to take the case where [alpha] = [beta].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n4. Let us suppose that the instrument passes from the position I to\r\nposition III (Fig. 4). Then the ruler C A will come to occupy the\r\nposition B A, from the fact that the instrument, continuing to move in\r\nthe same direction, will roll around the point B. It is well, then, to\r\nmanage so that the system shall have another point of support. For that\r\nreason I prolong C B, take B C' = B C, draw C' I, and describe the\r\ncircumference--the geometrical place of the points C'. I take C' D = C'\r\nB and obtain at D the position of the fixed point at which the needle\r\nis inserted. In Fig. 4 are represented different positions of the\r\ninstrument; and it may be seen that all the points C C', and the centers\r\nO O', are found upon the circumferences that have their center at I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n5. The manipulation and use of the instrument are of the simplest\r\ncharacter. Being given any two straight converging lines whatever,\r\n[alpha] [beta] and [gamma] [delta] (Fig. 5), in order to trace all the\r\nothers I insert a needle at A and arrange the instrument as seen at S. I\r\ndraw A B and A B', and from there carry it to S' in such a way that the\r\nruler being on [gamma] [delta], one of the resting rulers passes through\r\nA. I draw the line C B which meets A B at the point B, the position\r\nsought for the second needle. In order to draw the straight lines which\r\nare under [alpha] [beta], it is only necessary to hold the needle A in\r\nplace and to fix one at B', making A B' = A B. In this case S\" indicates\r\none of the positions of the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n6. The point A was chosen arbitrarily, but it is evident that that of\r\nthe needles depends on its distance from the point of convergence. Thus,\r\non taking A' instead of A in the case of Fig. 3, they approach, while\r\nthe contrary happens on choosing the point A\". It is clear that the\r\ndifferent positions that a needle A may take are found on a straight\r\nline which runs to the point of meeting.\r\n\r\n7. If the instrument were jointed or hinged at C, that is to say, so\r\nthat we could at will modify the angle of the resting ruler, we might\r\nmake the position of the needles depend on such angle, and conversely.\r\n\r\n8. Being given the length C I (Fig. 6), to establish the position of the\r\nneedles so that all the lines outside of the sheet shall converge at I.\r\nTo do this, it is well to determine C D, and then to draw the straight\r\nline A D B perpendicular to C I, so as to have at A and B the points at\r\nwhich the needles must be placed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n                       ___      ___\r\n            ___        AD²      CD²\r\n  CD x DI = AD².

In order to avoid all calculation, we may proceed thus: If I wish to\r\narrange the instrument so that C I represents a given quantity (§ 8),\r\nI take (Fig. 7) the length Ci = CI/n, where n is any entire number\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nIn other terms, Ci is the reduction to the scale of CI.\r\n\r\nI describe the circumference C b i a, and arrange the instrument as seen\r\nin the figure, and measure the length C b.\r\n\r\nIt is visible that\r\n\r\n  C i     1     C b     C d\r\n ----- = --- = ----- = ------; then C B = n.C b   (5)\r\n  C I     n     C B     C D\r\n\r\n  CD = n.C d;   (6)\r\n\r\nand, consequently, the position of the needles which are found at A and\r\nB are determined.\r\n\r\n12. The question treated in § 10, then, is simply solved. In fact, on\r\ndescribing the circumference C b i a with any radius whatever, I shall\r\nhave\r\n\r\n       C B\r\n  n = -----;      (7)\r\n       c b\r\n\r\nand, consequently,\r\n\r\n  C I = n.C i     (8)\r\n\r\n13. As may be seen, the instrument composed of three firmly united\r\nrulers is the simplest of all and easy to use. Any one can construct it\r\nfor himself with a piece of cardboard, and give the angle 2 [alpha] the\r\nvalue that he thinks most suitable for each application. The greater\r\n2 [alpha] is, the shorter is the distance at which we should put the\r\nneedles for a given point of meeting.\r\n\r\n14 The jointed instrument may be constructed as shown in Figs 8, 9, and\r\n10. The three pieces, A. B, and C, united by a pivot, O, in which there\r\nis a small hole, are of brass or other metal. Rulers may be easily\r\nprocured of any length whatever. The instrument is Y-shaped. In the\r\nparticular case in which [alpha] = 180° it becomes T-shaped, and serves\r\nto draw parallel lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10]\r\n\r\n15. The instrument may be used likewise, as we have seen, to draw arcs\r\nof circles of the diameter C I or of the radius A O = r, whose center o\r\nfalls outside the paper. The pencil will be rested on C. We may operate\r\nas follows (Fig. 2): Being given the direction of the radii A O and B\r\nO, or, what amounts to the same thing, the tangents to the curve at the\r\ngiven points, A and B to be united, we draw the line A D and raise at\r\nits center the perpendicular D C, which, prolonged, passes necessarily\r\nthrough the center.

STRONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to properly understand the requirements of an effective\r\nfeed-water purifier, it will be necessary to understand something of the\r\ncharacter of the impurities of natural waters used for feeding\r\nboilers, and of the manner in which they become troublesome in causing\r\nincrustation or scale, as it is commonly called, in steam boilers. All\r\nnatural waters are known to contain more or less mineral matter, partly\r\nheld in solution and partly in mechanical suspension. These mineral\r\nimpurities are derived by contact of the water with the earth's surface,\r\nand by percolation through its soil and rocks. The substances taken\r\nup in solution by this process consist chiefly of the carbonates\r\nand sulphates of lime and magnesia, and the chloride of sodium. The\r\nmaterials carried in mechanical suspension are clay, sand, and vegetable\r\nmatter. There are many other saline ingredients in various natural\r\nwaters, but they exist in such minute quantities, and are generally so\r\nvery soluble, that their presence may safely be ignored in treating of\r\nthe utility of boiler waters.\r\n\r\nOf the above named salts, the carbonates of lime and magnesia are\r\nsoluble only when the water contains free carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nOur American rivers contain from 2 to 6 grains of saline matter to the\r\ngallon in solution, and a varying quantity--generally exceeding 10\r\ngrains to the gallon--in mechanical suspension. The waters of wells and\r\nsprings hold a smaller quantity in suspension, but generally carry a\r\nlarger percentage of dissolved salts in solution, varying from 10 to 650\r\ngrains to the gallon.\r\n\r\nWhen waters containing the carbonates of lime and magnesia in solution\r\nare boiled, the carbonic acid is driven off, and the salts, deprived of\r\ntheir solvent, are rapidly precipitated in fine crystalline particles,\r\nwhich adhere tenaciously to whatever surface they fall upon. With\r\nrespect to the sulphate of lime, the case is different. It is at best\r\nonly sparingly soluble in water, one part (by weight) of the salt\r\nrequiring nearly 500 parts of water to dissolve it. As the water\r\nevaporates in the boiler, however, a point is soon reached where\r\nsupersaturation occurs, as the water freshly fed into it constantly\r\nbrings fresh accessions of the salt; and when this point is reached,\r\nthe sulphate of lime is precipitated in the same form and with the same\r\ntenaciously adherent quality as the carbonates. There is, however,\r\na peculiar property possessed by this salt which facilitates its\r\nprecipitation, namely, that its solubility in water diminishes as the\r\ntemperature rises. This fact is of special interest, since, if properly\r\ntaken advantage of, it is possible to effect its almost complete removal\r\nfrom the feed-water of boilers,\r\n\r\nThere is little difference in the solubility of the sulphate of lime\r\nuntil the temperature has risen somewhat above 212° Fahr., when it\r\nrapidly diminishes, and finally, at nearly 300°, all of this salt,\r\nheld in solution at lower temperatures, will be precipitated when the\r\ntemperature has risen to that point. The following table[1] represents\r\nthe solubility of sulphate of lime in sea water at different\r\ntemperatures:\r\n\r\n  Temperature.

Cousté, _Annales des Mines_ V 69. _Recherches sur Vincrustation\r\ndes Chaudières a vapour_. Mr. Hugh Lee Pattison, of Newcastle-on-Tyne,\r\nat the meeting of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers of Great\r\nBritain, in August, 1880, remarked on this subject that \"The solubility\r\nof sulphate of lime in water diminishes as the temperature rises. At\r\nordinary temperatures pure water dissolves about 150 grains of sulphate\r\nof lime per gallon; but at a temperature of 250° Fahr., at which the\r\npressure of steam is equal to about 2 atmospheres, only about 40 grains\r\nper gallon are held in solution. At a pressure of 3 atmospheres, and\r\ntemperature of 302° Fahr., it is practically insoluble. The point\r\nof maximum solubility is about 95° Fahr. The presence of magnesium\r\nchloride, or of calcium chloride, in water, diminishes its power of\r\ndissolving sulphate of lime, while the presence of sodium chloride\r\nincreases that power. As an instance of the latter fact, we find a\r\nboiler works much cleaner which is fed alternately with fresh water and\r\nwith brackish water pumped from the Tyne when the tide is high than one\r\nwhich is fed with fresh water constantly.\"]\r\n\r\nThese figures hold substantially for fresh as well as for sea water, for\r\nthe sulphate of lime becomes wholly insoluble in sea water, or in soft\r\nwater, at temperatures comprised between 280° and 300° Fahr.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this that it is simply necessary to heat water up to a\r\ntemperature of 250° in order to effect the precipitation of four fifths\r\nof the sulphate of lime it may have contained, or to the temperature of\r\n290° in order to precipitate it entirely. The bearing of these facts on\r\nthe purification of feed-waters will appear further on. The explanation\r\noffered to account for the gradually increasing insolubility of sulphate\r\nof lime on heating, is, that the hydrate, in which condition it exists\r\nin solution, is partially decomposed, anhydrous calcic sulphate\r\nbeing formed, the dehydration becoming more and more complete as the\r\ntemperature rises. Sulphate of magnesia, chloride of sodium (common\r\nsalt), and all the other more soluble salts contained in natural waters\r\nare likewise precipitated by the process of supersaturation, but owing\r\nto their extreme solubility their precipitation will never be effected\r\nin boilers; all mechanically suspended matter tends naturally to\r\nsubside.\r\n\r\nWhere water containing such mineral and suspended matter is fed to a\r\nsteam boiler, there results a combined deposit, of which the carbonate\r\nof lime usually forms the greater part, and which remains more or less\r\nfirmly adherent to the inner surfaces of the boiler, undisturbed by the\r\nforce of the boiling currents. Gradually accumulating, it becomes harder\r\nand thicker, and, if permitted to accumulate, may at length attain such\r\nthickness as to prevent the proper heating of the water by any fire that\r\nmay be maintained in the furnace. Dr. Joseph G. Rogers, who has made\r\nboiler waters and incrustations a subject of careful study, declares\r\nthat the high heats necessary to heat water through thick scale will\r\nsometimes actually convert the scale into a species of glass, by\r\ncombining the sand, mechanically separated, with the alkaline salts. The\r\nsame authority has carefully estimated the non-conducting properties\r\nof such boiler incrustations. On this point he remarks that the evil\r\neffects of the scale are due to the fact that it is relatively a\r\nnonconductor of heat. As compared with iron, its conducting power is\r\nas 1 to 37½, consequently more fuel is required to heat water in an\r\nincrusted boiler than in the same boiler if clean. Rogers estimates that\r\na scale 1-16th of an inch thick will require the extra expenditure of\r\n15 per cent. more fuel, and this ratio increases as the scale grows\r\nthicker. Thus, when it is one-quarter of an inch thick, 60 per cent.\r\nmore fuel is needed; one-half inch, 112 per cent. more fuel, and so on.\r\n\r\nRogers very forcibly shows the evil consequences to the boiler from the\r\nexcessive heating required to raise steam in a badly incrusted boiler,\r\nby the following illustration: To raise steam to a pressure of 90 pounds\r\nthe water must be heated to about 320° Fahr. In a clean boiler of\r\none-quarter inch iron this may be done by heating the external surface\r\nof the shell to about 325° Fahr. If, now, one-half an inch of scale\r\nintervenes between the boiler shell and the water, such is its quality\r\nof resisting the passage of heat that it will be necessary to heat the\r\nfire surface to about 700°, almost to a low red heat, to effect the same\r\nresult. Now, the higher the temperature at which iron is kept the more\r\nrapidly it oxidizes, and at any heat above 600° it very soon becomes\r\ngranular and brittle, and is liable to bulge, crack, or otherwise give\r\nway to the internal pressure. This condition predisposes the boiler to\r\nexplosion and makes expensive repairs necessary. The presence of such\r\nscale, also, renders more difficult the raising, maintaining, and\r\nlowering of steam.\r\n\r\nThe nature of incrustation and the evils resulting therefrom having been\r\nstated, it now remains to consider the methods that have been devised\r\nto overcome them. These methods naturally resolve themselves into\r\ntwo kinds, chemical and mechanical. The chemical method has two\r\nmodifications; in one the design is to purify the water in large tanks\r\nor reservoirs, by the addition of certain substances which shall\r\nprecipitate all the scale-forming ingredients before the water is fed\r\ninto the boiler; in the other the chemical agent is fed into the boiler\r\nfrom time to time, and the object is to effect the precipitation of the\r\nsaline matter in such a manner that it will not form solid masses of\r\nadherent scale. Where chemical methods of purification are resorted to,\r\nthe latter plan is generally followed as being the least troublesome. Of\r\nthe many substances used for this purpose, however, some are measurably\r\nsuccessful; the majority of them are unsatisfactory or objectionable.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical methods are also very various. Picking, scraping,\r\ncleaning, etc., are very generally resorted to, but the scale is so\r\ntenacious that this only partially succeeds, and, as it necessitates\r\nstoppage of work, it is wasteful. In addition to this plan, a great\r\nvariety of mechanical contrivances for heating and purifying the\r\nfeed-water, by separating and intercepting the saline matter on its\r\npassage through the apparatus, have been devised. Many of these are of\r\ngreat utility and have come into very general use. In the Western States\r\nespecially, where the water in most localities is heavily charged\r\nwith lime, these mechanical purifiers have become quite indispensable\r\nwherever steam users are alive to the necessity of generating steam with\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nMost of these appliances, however, only partly fulfill their intended\r\npurposes. They consist essentially of a chamber through which the\r\nfeed-water is passed, and in which it is heated almost to the boiling\r\npoint by exhaust steam from the engine. According to the temperature\r\nto which the water is heated in this chamber, and the length of time\r\nrequired for its passage through the chamber, the carbonates are more or\r\nless completely precipitated, as likewise the matter held in mechanical\r\nsuspension. The precipitated matter subsides on shelves or elsewhere in\r\nthe chamber, from which it is removed from time to time. The sulphate\r\nof lime, however, and the other soluble salts, and in some cases also a\r\nportion of the carbonates that were not precipitated during the brief\r\ntime of passage through the heater, are passed on into the boiler.\r\n\r\nAppreciating this insufficiency of existing feed-water purifiers to\r\neffectually remove these dangerous saline impurities, the writer in\r\ndesigning the feed-water heater now to be described paid special\r\nattention to the separation of all matters, soluble and insoluble; and\r\nhe has succeeded in passing the water to the boilers quite free from any\r\nsubstance which would cause scaling or coherent deposit. His attention\r\nwas called more particularly to the necessity of extreme care in this\r\nrespect, through the great annoyance suffered by steam users in the\r\nCentral and Western States, where the water is heavily charged with\r\nlime. Very simple and even primitive boilers are here used; the most\r\nnecessary consideration being handiness in cleaning, and not the highest\r\nevaporative efficiency. These boilers are therefore very wasteful, only\r\nevaporating, when covered with lime scale, from two to three pounds of\r\nwater with one pound of the best coal, and requiring cleansing once\r\na week at the very least. The writer's interest being aroused, he\r\ndetermined, if possible, to remedy these inconveniences, and accordingly\r\nhe made a careful study of the subject, and examined all the heaters\r\nthen in the market. He found them all, without exception, insufficient\r\nto free the feed-water from the most dangerous of impurities, namely,\r\nthe sulphate and the carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nTaking the foregoing facts, well known to chemists and engineers, as the\r\nbasis of his operations, the writer perceived that all substances likely\r\nto give trouble by deposition would be precipitated at a temperature of\r\nabout 250° F.\r\n\r\nHis plan was, therefore, to make a feed-water heater in which the water\r\ncould be raised to that temperature before entering the boiler. Now, by\r\nusing the heat from the exhaust steam the water may be raised to between\r\n208° and 212° F. It has yet to be raised to 250° F.; and for this\r\npurpose the writer saw at once the advantage that would be attained by\r\nusing a coil of live steam from the boiler. This device does not cause\r\nany loss of steam, except the small loss due to radiation, since the\r\nwater in any case would have to be heated up to the temperature of the\r\nsteam on entering the boiler. By adopting this method, the chemical\r\nprecipitation, which would otherwise occur in the boiler, takes place\r\nin the heater; and it is only necessary now to provide a filter, which\r\nshall prevent anything passing that can possibly cause scale.\r\n\r\nHaving explained as briefly as possible the principles on which the\r\nsystem is founded, the writer will now describe the details of the\r\nheater itself.\r\n\r\nIn Figs. 1 and 2 are shown an elevation and a vertical section of\r\nthe heater. The cast-iron base, A, is divided into two parts by the\r\ndiaphragm, B. The exhaust steam enters at C, passes up the larger tubes,\r\nD, which are fastened into the upper shell of the casting, returns by\r\nthe smaller tubes, E, which are inside the others, and passes away by\r\nthe passage, F. The inner tube only serves for discharge. It will be\r\nseen at once that this arrangement, while securing great heating surface\r\nin a small space, at the same time leaves freedom for expansion and\r\ncontraction, without producing strains. The free area for passage of\r\nsteam is arranged to be one and a half times that of the exhaust pipe,\r\nso that there is no possible danger of back pressure. The wrought iron\r\nshell, G, connecting the stand, A, with the dome, H, is made strong\r\nenough to withstand the full boiler pressure. An ordinary casing, J,\r\nof wood or other material prevents loss by radiation of heat. The\r\ncold water from the pump passes into the heater through the injector\r\narrangement, K, and coming in contact with the tubes, D, is heated; it\r\nthen rises to the coil, L, which is supplied with steam from the boiler,\r\nand thus becomes further heated, attaining there a temperature of from\r\n250° to 270° F., according to the pressure in the boiler. This high\r\ntemperature causes the separation of the dissolved salts; and on the way\r\nto the boiler the water passes through the filter, M, becoming thereby\r\nfreed from all precipitated matter before passing away to the boiler at\r\nN. The purpose of the injector, K, and the pipe passing from O to K, is\r\nto cause a continual passage of air or steam from the upper part of the\r\ndome to the lower part of the heater, so that any precipitate carried up\r\nin froth may be again returned to the under side of the filter, in order\r\nmore effectually to separate it, before any chance occurs of its passing\r\ninto the boiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Elevation. FIG. 2.--Vertical Section]\r\n\r\nThe filter consists of wood charcoal in the lower half and bone black\r\nabove firmly held between two perforated plates, as shown. After the\r\nheater has been in use for from three to ten hours, according to the\r\nnature of the water used, it is necessary to blow out the heater, in\r\norder to clear the filter from deposit. To do this, the cock at R is\r\nopened, and the water is discharged by the pressure from the boiler. The\r\nsteam is allowed to pass through the heater for some little time, in\r\norder to clear the filter completely. After this operation, all is ready\r\nto commence work again. By this means the filter remains fit for use for\r\nmonths without change of the charcoal.\r\n\r\nWhere a jet condenser is used, either of two plans may be adopted. One\r\nplan takes the feed-water from the hot well and passes the exhaust from\r\nthe feed pumps through the heater, using at the same time an increased\r\namount of coil for the live steam. By this means a temperature of water\r\nis attained high enough to cause deposition, and at the same time to\r\nproduce decomposition of the oil brought over from the cylinders. The\r\nother plan places the heater in the line of exhaust from the engine to\r\nthe condenser, also using a larger amount of coil. Both these methods\r\nwork well. The writer sometimes uses the steam from the coil to work the\r\nfeed pump; or, if the heater stands high enough, it is only necessary\r\nto make a connection with the boiler, when the water formed by the\r\ncondensation of the steam runs back to the boiler, and thus the coil is\r\nkept constantly at the necessary temperature.\r\n\r\nIn adapting the heater to locomotives, we were met with the difficulty\r\nof want of space to put a heater sufficiently large to handle the\r\nextremely large amount of water evaporated on a locomotive worked up to\r\nits full capacity, being from 1,500 to 2,500 gallons per hour, or from\r\nfive hundred to one thousand h.p. We designed various forms of heaters\r\nand tried them, but have finally decided on the one shown in the\r\nengraving, Fig. 3, which consists of a lap welded tube, 13 inches\r\ninternal diameter, 12 feet long, with a cast-iron head which is divided\r\ninto two compartments or chambers by a diaphragm. Into this head are\r\nscrewed 60 tubes, one inch outside diameter and 12 feet long, which\r\nare of seamless brass. These are the heating tubes, within which\r\nare internal tubes for circulation only, which are screwed into the\r\ndiaphragm and extend to within a very short distance of the end of the\r\nheating tube. The exhaust steam for heating is taken equally from both\r\nsides of the locomotive by tapping a two-inch nipple with a cup shaped\r\nextension on it in such a way as to catch a portion of the exhaust\r\nwithout interfering with the free escape of the steam for the blast, and\r\nwithout any back pressure, as it relieves the back pressure as much as\r\nit condenses. The pipe from one side of the engine is connected with\r\nthe chamber into which the heating tubes are screwed, and is in direct\r\ncommunication with them. The pipe from the other side is connected with\r\nthe chamber into which the circulating tubes are screwed. The beat of\r\nthe exhaust, working, as it does, on the quarters, causes a constant\r\nsawing or backward and forward circulation of steam without any\r\ndischarge, and only the condensation is carried off.\r\n\r\nThe water is brought from the pump and discharged into the lower side of\r\nthe heater well forward, and passes around the heating tubes to the end,\r\nwhen it is discharged into a pipe that carries it forward, either direct\r\nto the check or into the purifier, which is located between the frames\r\nunder the boiler, and consists of a chamber in which are arranged a live\r\nsteam coil and a filter above the coil. The water coming in contact\r\nwith the coil, its temperature is increased from the temperature of the\r\nexhaust, 210°, to about 250° Fahr., which causes the separation of the\r\nlime salts as before described, and it then passes through the filter\r\nand direct to the boiler from above the filter, which is cleansed by\r\nblowing back through it as before described.\r\n\r\nOne of these heaters lately tested showed a saving in coal of 22 per\r\ncent, and an increase of evaporation of 1.09 pounds of water per pound\r\nof coal.--_Franklin Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTEVERDE'S STATUE OF ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis precious statue forms the noble figure that adorns the monument\r\nerected to the memory of the architect Carles Sada, who died in 1873.\r\nThis remarkable funereal monument is 20 feet high, the superior portion\r\nconsisting of a sarcophagus resting upon a level base.

If a town had sprung into existence in a far Western\r\nState with so much celerity, the phenomenon would not be considered\r\nremarkable, perhaps; but growths of this kind are not indigenous to the\r\nNew England of the present era. Gilbertville has probably outstripped\r\nall New England villages in the race of the past three years. It is only\r\none of the signs that old Maine is not dead yet.\r\n\r\nGilbert Brothers erected a saw mill here three years ago. A year later,\r\nthe Denison Paper Manufacturing Company, of Mechanic Falls, erected a\r\nbig pulp mill, which, also, the town voted to exempt from taxation for\r\nten years. The mills are valuable companions for each other. The pulp\r\nmill utilizes all the waste of the saw mill. A settlement was speedily\r\nbuilt by the operatives. Gilbertville now boasts of a post-office, a\r\nstore, several large boarding houses, a nice school house, and over 500\r\ninhabitants. The pulp mill employs seventy men. It runs night and day.\r\nIt manufactures monthly 350 cords of poplar and spruce into pulp. It\r\nconsumes monthly 500 cords of wood for fuel, 45 casks of soda ash,\r\nvalued at $45 per cask, nine car loads of lime, 24,000 pounds to the\r\ncar. It produces 1,000,000 pounds of wet fiber, valued at about $17,000,\r\nmonthly. The pay roll amounts to $3,500 per month.\r\n\r\nThe larger part of the stock used by the mill consists of poplar logs\r\nfloated down the Androscoggin and its tributaries. One thousand two\r\nhundred cords of poplar cut in four-foot lengths are piled about the\r\nmill; and a little further up the river are 5,000 cords more. The logs\r\nare hauled from the river and sawed into lengths by a donkey engine,\r\nwhich cuts about sixty cords per day, and pulls out fourteen logs at\r\na time. All the spruce slabs made by the saw mill are used with this\r\npoplar. The wood is fed to a wheel armed with many sharp knives. It\r\ndevours a cord of wood every fifteen minutes. The four-foot sticks are\r\nchewed into fine chips as rapidly as they can be thrust into the maw of\r\nthe chopper. They are carried directly from this machine to the top of\r\nthe mill by an endless belt with pockets attached. There are hatchways\r\nin the attic floor, which open upon rotary iron boilers. Into these\r\nboilers the chips are raked, and a solution of lime and soda ash is\r\npoured over them.\r\n\r\nThis bath destroys all the resinous matter in the wood, and after\r\ncooking five hours the chips are reduced to a mass of soft black pulp.\r\nEach rotary will contain two cords of chips. After the cooking, the pulp\r\nis dumped into iron tanks in the basement, where it is thoroughly washed\r\nwith streams of clean cold water. It is then pumped into a machine which\r\nrolls it into broad sheets. These sheets are folded, and condensed by\r\na hydraulic press of 200 tons pressure. This process reduces its bulk\r\nfifty per cent., and sends profuse jets of water flying out of it. The\r\nsoda ash, in which, mixed with lime and water, the chips are cooked, is\r\nreclaimed, and used over and over again. The liquor, after it has been\r\nused, is pumped into tanks on top of large brick furnaces. As it is\r\nheated, it thickens. It is brought nearer and nearer the fire until it\r\ncrystallizes, and finally burns into an ash. Eighty per cent. of the ash\r\nused is thus reclaimed. This process is an immense saving to the pulp\r\nmanufacturers. The work in the pulp mill is severe, and is slightly\r\ntinged with danger.\r\n\r\nThree thousand four hundred pounds of white ash to 2,100 pounds of lime\r\nare the proportions in which the liquor in each vat is mixed. One does\r\nnot envy the lot of the stout fellows who crawl into the great rotaries\r\nto stow away the chips. The hurry of business is so great that they\r\ncannot wait for these boilers to cool naturally, after they have cooked\r\none batch, before putting in another. So they have a fan pump, to which\r\nis attached a canvas hose, and with this blow cooling air currents into\r\nthe boiler, or \"rotary,\" as they call it. The rotary is subjected to an\r\nimmense pressure, and is very stoutly made of thick iron plates, bolted\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nDescribing the business as carried on at Mechanic Falls, the same paper\r\nsays: There are six of these mills on the three dams over which the\r\nLittle Androscoggin falls. These are the Eagle, the Star, the Diamond,\r\nthe Union, the pulp, and the super calendering mills. The Eagle and the\r\nStar mills run on book papers of various grades. The Union mill runs on\r\nnewspaper. The old Diamond mill now prepares pulp stock. The pulp mill\r\ndoes nothing but bleach the rag pulp and prepare for the machines in the\r\nother mills; while the super-calendering mill gives the paper an extra\r\nfinish when ordered. There is practically but one series of processes by\r\nwhich the paper is made in the various mills.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that America is not ragged enough to produce the\r\nrequisite amount of stock for its own paper mills. Nearly all the rags\r\nused by the Denison Mills (and by others in various parts of the country\r\nas well) are imported from the old countries. All the rags first go\r\nthrough the \"duster.\" This is a big cylindrical shell of coarse wire\r\nnetting. It is rapidly revolved, while a screw running through its\r\ncenter is turned in the opposite direction. Air currents are forced\r\nthrough it by a power fan. The rags are continuously fed into one end of\r\nthis shell, which is about ten feet long and four feet in diameter. The\r\nscrew forces them through the whole length of the shell, while they are\r\nkept buzzing around and subjected to breezes which blow thick clouds of\r\ndirt and dust out of them. The air of the room is thick with European\r\nand Asiatic earth. It is swept up in great rolls on the floor. The man\r\nwho operates the duster should have leather lungs.\r\n\r\nOverhead is a long room where thirty girls are busily sorting the rags\r\nfor the various grades of papers. That the dusting machine is no more\r\nperfect than a human machine is evinced by the murky atmosphere of this\r\nroom, by the particles that lodge in the throat of the visitor, and\r\nby the frequent coughing of the sorters. They protect their hair with\r\nturbans of veiling, occasionally decorated with a bit of bright color.\r\nThese turbans give the room the appearance of an industrious Turkish\r\nharem. Short, sharp scythe blades, like Turkish scimeters, gleam above\r\nall the girls' benches. When a sorter wishes to cut a rag, she pulls it\r\nacross the edge of this blade, and is not obliged to hunt for a pair of\r\nshears.\r\n\r\nCurious discoveries are frequently made in the rags. Old pockets,\r\ncontaining small sums of money, are occasionally found. A foreign coin\r\nvalued at about $3 was found a few days ago. In the paper stock, quaint\r\nand valuable old books or pictures are found often. One of the workmen\r\nhas a museum composed of curiosities found amid the rags and shreds of\r\npaper. Rev. Dr. Bolles, of Massachusetts, makes an annual pilgrimage\r\nto Mechanic Falls for the sake of the rare old pamphlets, books, and\r\nengravings that he may dig out.\r\n\r\nStuffed in hogsheads, the rags are lowered from this room through\r\na hatchway, and are given a red hot lime bath. They are placed in\r\nponderous cylinders of boiler iron, which revolve horizontally in great\r\ngears high above the floor. A mixture of lime and water, which has been\r\nprepared in large brick vats, is poured over them. An iron door, secured\r\nby huge bolts, is closed on them. The cylinder slowly turns around, and\r\nchurns the rags in the lime-juice twelve hours. This process is called\r\nbleaching. When the rags come out they are far from white, however. They\r\nare of a uniform dirty brown hue. But the colors have lost their gripe.\r\nWhen the rags shall have been submitted to the grinding and washing in\r\npure water, as we shall see them presently, they are easily whitened.\r\nThe lime bath is the purgatory of the paper stock.\r\n\r\nBefore we go any further, we must see what becomes of those soft\r\nand lop-sided bundles which are going into the mills. These contain\r\nchemically prepared wood fiber, a certain percentage of which is used\r\nin nearly all the papers made now. It gives the paper a greater body,\r\nalthough its fiber is not so strong as that made of rags. The pulp comes\r\ndown from Canton in soft brown sheets. These are at once bleached. The\r\nbrown fiber is placed in a bath of cold water and chlorate of lime.\r\nThere it quietly rests till a sediment settles at the bottom of the\r\ntank. At an opportune moment the workman pours in a copious libation\r\nof boiling water. This causes the escape of the chlorine gas, which\r\ndestroys all the color in the pulp. In half an hour it comes out, a mass\r\nof smoking fibers as white as a snow heap. The drainers into which it\r\ngoes are large pens with perforated tile floors. The pulp remains in the\r\ndrainers till it so dry it is handled with a pitchfork.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to look at the beating machines, which have to perform\r\na very important part in paper making. These are large iron tanks with\r\npowerful grinders revolving in them. Barrow loads of the brown rags are\r\ndumped into them, and clear cold water is poured in. The grinders are\r\nthen started. They chew the rags into fine bits. They keep the mass\r\nof rags and water circulating incessantly in the tanks. Clean water\r\nconstantly flows in and dirty water as constantly flows out. In the\r\ncourse of six hours the rags are reduced to a perfectly white pulpy\r\nmass. There is one mill, as we have said, devoted exclusively to the\r\nreduction of rags to this white pulp. It is dried in drainers such as we\r\nsaw a few moments ago filled with the wood fiber.\r\n\r\nThere are other beating machines just like these, which perform a\r\nslightly different service. Their function may be compared to that of an\r\napothecary's mortar or a cook's mixing dish. The white rag stock and the\r\nwhite wood fiber are mixed in these, in the required proportions.\r\nAt this stage, the pulp is adulterated with China clay, to give it\r\nsubstance and weight; here the sizing (composed of resin and sal soda)\r\nis put in; oil of vitriol, bluing, yellow ocher, and other chemicals are\r\nadded, to whiten or to tint the paper. These beaters are much like\r\nso many soup kettles. Upon the kind, number, and proportion of the\r\ningredients depends the nature of the product. The percentages of rag\r\npulp, wood pulp, clay, coloring, etc., used, depend upon the quality of\r\npaper ordered.\r\n\r\nAfter the final beating, the mixture descends into a large reservoir\r\ncalled the \"stuff chest,\" whence it is pumped to the paper machine. The\r\npulp is of the consistency of milk when it pours from the spout of\r\nthe pumps on the paper machine. The latter is a complicated series of\r\nrollers, belts, sieves, blankets, pumps, and gears, one hundred feet\r\nlong. To describe it or to understand a description of it would require\r\nthe vocabulary and the knowledge of a scientist. The milky pulp first\r\npasses over a belt of fine wire cloth, through which the water partly\r\ndrains. It is ingeniously made to glide over two perforated iron plates,\r\nunder which pumps are constantly sucking. You can plainly see the broad\r\nsheet of pulp lose its water and gain thickness as it goes over these\r\nplates. Broad, blanket-like belts of felt take it and carry it over and\r\nbetween large rolling cylinders filled with hot steam. These dry and\r\nharden it into a sheet which will support itself; and without the aid of\r\nblankets it winds among iron rolls, called calenders, which squeeze it\r\nand give it surface. It is wound upon revolving reels at the end of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nIf a better surface or gloss is required, it is carried to the super\r\ncalendering mill, where it is steamed and subjected to a long and\r\ncircuitous journey up and down tall stands of calenders upon calenders.\r\nThe paper is cut by machines having long, winding knives which revolve\r\nslowly and cut, on the scissors principle--no two points of the blade\r\nbearing on the paper with equal pressure at once. Girls pack the sheets\r\non the tables as they fall from the cutters, and throw out the damaged\r\nor dirtied sheets. A small black spot or hole or imperfection of any\r\nsort is sufficient to reject a sheet. In some orders fifty per cent. of\r\nthe sheets are thrown out. There is no waste, as the damaged paper is\r\nground into pulp again. Having been cut, the paper must be counted and\r\nfolded. Then it is packed into bundles for shipment. The young lady who\r\ndoes the counting and folding is the wonder of the mill. Giving the\r\nsheets a twist with one hand so as to spread open the edges, she gallops\r\nthe fingers of the other hand among them; and as quickly as you or I\r\ncould count three, she counts twenty-four and folds the quire. She takes\r\nfour sheets with a finger and goes her whole hand and one finger more;\r\nthus she gets twenty-four sheets. Long practice is required to do the\r\ncounting rapidly and accurately. Twenty-four sheets, no more and no\r\nless, are always found in her quires.\r\n\r\nPapers of different grades are made of different stock, but by the same\r\nprocess. Some paper stock is used. This must be bleached in lime and\r\nsoda ash. There are powerful steam engines in the mills for use when\r\nthe water is low. There are large furnaces and boilers which supply the\r\nsteam used in the processes.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Denison employ 175 hands at Mechanic Falls. Their pay roll\r\namounts to about $5,000 per month. The mills produce 350,000 pounds of\r\npaper per month and they ship several car-loads of prepared wood-pulp,\r\nin excess of that required for their own use, weekly. The annual value\r\nof their product is not far from $300,000. They use, for sundries,\r\neach month, 300 tons of coal, 100 casks of common lime, 250 gallons of\r\nburning-oil, 28,000 pounds of chlorate of lime, 3,700 pounds of soda\r\nash. 10,000 pounds of resin. 24,000 pounds of sal soda, 22,000 pounds of\r\noil of vitriol, 22,000 pounds of China clay, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT-MEAL BREAD AS A MEANS OF DIMINISHING TUBERCULAR DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy M. YATES, Hon. Sec. Bread Reform League, London.\r\n\r\nIt is well recognized that defective mineral nutrition is an important\r\nfactor in the production of rickets and bad teeth, but as its\r\ninfluence in predisposing toward tuberculous disease is not so clearly\r\nascertained, will you kindly allow public attention to be directed to\r\na statement which was discussed at the Social Science and Sanitary\r\nCongresses and which, if confirmed by further scientific research,\r\nindicates a simple means of diminishing consumption, which, as Dr.\r\nWilliam Fair, F.R.S., says, \"is the greatest, the most constant, and the\r\nmost dreadful of all the diseases that affect mankind.\" In \"Phosphates\r\nin Nutrition,\" by Mr. M.F. Anderson, it is stated that although the\r\nexternal appearances and general condition of a body when death has\r\noccurred from starvation are very similar to those presented in\r\ntuberculous disease, in starvation, \"from wasting of the tissues, caused\r\nby the combustion of their organic matter, there would be an apparent\r\n_increase_ in the percentage proportion of mineral matter; on the other\r\nhand, in tubercular disease, there would be a material _decrease_ in the\r\nmineral matter as compared with the general wasting.\" Analyses, made\r\nby Mr. Anderson, of the vascular tissues of patients who have died\r\nof consumption, scrofula, and allied diseases, show \"a very marked\r\ndeficiency in the quantity of inorganic matter entering into their\r\ncomposition; this deficiency is not confined to the organs or tissues\r\nwhich are apparently the seat of the disease, but in a greater or lesser\r\ndegree pervades the whole capillary system.\"\r\n\r\nThe observations of Dr. Marcet, F.R.S., show that in phthisis there is\r\na considerable reduction of the normal amount of phosphoric acid in the\r\npulmonary tissues; and it is very probable that there is a general drain\r\nof phosphoric acid from the system.\r\n\r\nThis loss may be caused by the expectoration and night-sweats, or it may\r\nalso be produced by defective mineral nutrition, either from deficient\r\nsupply in the food, or from non assimilation. But, whatever causes this\r\ndeficiency, it is universally acknowledged that it is essential the food\r\nshould contain a proper supply of the mineral elements. If the body is\r\nwell nourished, the resisting force of the system is raised. Professor\r\nKoch and others, who accept the germ theory of disease to its fullest\r\nextent, state that the minute organisms of tubercular disease do not\r\noccur in the tissues of healthy bodies, and that when introduced into a\r\nliving body their propagation and increase are greatly favored by a low\r\nstate of the general health.\r\n\r\nDr. Pavy, F.R.S., showed in his address on the \"Dietetics of Bread\" that\r\nin white flour, instead of obtaining the 23 parts of mineral matter\r\nto 100 parts of nitrogenous matter--which is the accepted ratio of\r\na standard diet--we should only get 4.20 parts of mineral matter.\r\nProfessor Church states that 1 lb. of white flour has only 49 grains of\r\nmineral matter, while 1 lb. of whole wheat meal has 119 grains. Whole\r\nwheat meal, besides containing other essential mineral elements,\r\nhas double the amount of lime, and nearly three times the amount of\r\nphosphoric acid; so that if defective mineral nutrition in any way\r\npredisposes to consumption, the adoption of wheat meal prepared in a\r\ndigestible and palatable form is of primary importance for those who are\r\nunable to obtain the phosphates from high-priced animal foods.\r\n\r\nWheat meal has also great advantages for those who are able to afford\r\nanimal food, for, as Dr. Pavy stated, \"It acts as a greater stimulant to\r\nthe digestive organs.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probably due to this stimulating property of wheat meal that\r\npeople who have adopted it find they can digest animal fat much better\r\nthan previously. If this is corroborated by general experience, it may\r\nbe of great benefit in aiding the system to resist tendencies toward\r\nconsumption and scrofula, for these diseases are generally accompanied\r\nby loss of the power of assimilating fat. It is believed that a\r\ndeficiency of oleaginous matter is a predisposing cause of tuberculous\r\ndisease. An important prophylactic, therefore, against such maladies,\r\nwould be a general increase in the use of butter and other fatty foods.\r\n\r\nThere is such good reason to believe that a low state of nutrition\r\nfavors the development of tuberculous disease, that parents cannot be\r\ntoo strongly urged to provide their children with a proper supply of\r\nhealthy, nourishing, and pure food (under which term must, of course, be\r\nincluded pure air and pure water), for by so doing they may often arrest\r\nconsumptive tendencies, and thus would be diminished the ravages of\r\nthat fatal disease which, when once established, is \"the despair of the\r\nphysician, and the terror of the public.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK FISH COMMISSION PONDS AT CALEDONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the New York State fish farm at Caledonia is 6,000,000\r\nfry a year. The recently issued report of the fish commissioners says\r\nthat this year the ponds will be worked to their full capacity.\r\n\r\nThe supply of spawn has been greater than could be hatched there, and\r\nsupplies were sent to responsible persons in every State in the Union to\r\nbe experimented with. At the date of issuing the report the supply of\r\nstock fish at the hatchery embraced, it was estimated, a thousand salmon\r\ntrout, of weights ranging from four to twelve pounds; ten thousand\r\nbrook trout, from half a pound to two pounds in weight; thirty thousand\r\nCalifornia mountain trout, weighing from a quarter of a pound to three\r\npounds; forty-seven hundred rainbow trout, of from a quarter of a\r\npound to two pounds' weight; and a large number of hybrids produced by\r\ncrossing and interbreeding of different members of the salmon tribe. In\r\nthis connection reference is made to the interesting fact that hybrids\r\nof the fish family are not barren. Spawners produced by crossing the\r\nmale brook trout with the female salmon trout cast 72,000 eggs last\r\nfall, which hatched as readily as the spawn of their progenitors. The\r\nvalue of the stock of breeding fish at the hatchery is estimated at\r\n$20,000.\r\n\r\nThe hatch of salmon trout this season was not far from 1,200,000, and\r\nthese will be distributed chiefly in the large lakes of the interior.\r\nAbout a million little brook trout were produced. The commission doubts\r\nwhether much benefit has resulted from attempting to stock small streams\r\nthat have once been good trout waters, but the temperature of which has\r\nbeen changed by cutting away the forest trees that overhung them. The\r\nbest results have been attained where the waters are of considerable\r\nextent, especially those in and bordering on the wilderness in the\r\nnorthern part of the State. The experiments with California trout, have\r\nbeen very successful, and it is found that the streams most suitable for\r\nthem, are the Hudson, Genesee, Mohawk, Moose, Black, and Beaver rivers,\r\nand the East and West Canada creeks. The commission hopes to hatch\r\n6,000,000 or 8,000,000 shad this season at a cost of about $1,000.\r\nConcerning German carp, the commissioners find that the water at\r\nCaledonia is too cold for this fish, but think that carp would do well\r\nin waters further south.\r\n\r\nThe commission awaits a more liberal appropriation of money before\r\nbeginning the work of hatching at the new State fish farm at Cold\r\nSpring, on the north side of Long Island, thirty miles out from\r\nBrooklyn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIOCENE MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrant Allen, an English evolutionist, gives this imaginary picture\r\nof our supposed ancestor: \"We may not unjustifiably picture him to\r\nourselves as a tall and hairy creature, more or less erect, but with a\r\nslouching gait, black faced and whiskered, with prominent, prognathous\r\nmuzza, and large, pointed canine teeth, those of each jaw fitted into\r\nan interspace in the opposite row. These teeth, as Mr. Darwin suggests,\r\nwere used in the combats of the males. His forehead was no doubt low and\r\nretreating, with bony bosses underlying the shaggy eyebrows, which\r\ngave him a fierce expression, something like that of the gorilla. But\r\nalready, in all likelihood, he had learned to walk habitually erect, and\r\nhad begun to develop a human pelvis, as well as to carry his head more\r\nstraight on his shoulders. That some such animal must have existed seems\r\nto me an inevitable corollary from the general principles of evolution\r\nand a natural inference from the analogy of other living genera.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOULIER'S TUBE-GAUGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs well known, the method by which glass barometer tubes are made gives\r\nthem variable calibers. Not only do the different tubes vary in size,\r\nbut even the same tube is apt to have different diameters throughout\r\nits length, and its sections are not always circular. Manufacturers\r\nof barometers often have need to know exactly the dimensions of the\r\nsections of these tubes, and to ascertain whether they are equal\r\nthroughout a certain length of tube, and this is especially necessary in\r\nthose instruments in which the surfaces of the sections of the reservoir\r\nand tube must bear a definite ratio to one another. Having ascertained\r\nthat no apparatus existed for measuring the caliber of these and\r\nanolagous tubes, and that manufacturers had been accustomed to make the\r\nmeasurements by roundabout methods, Colonel Goulier has been led to\r\ndevise a small apparatus for the purpose, and which is shown in the\r\naccompanying cuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOULIER'S TUBE GAUGE. (Plan and longitudinal and\r\ntranverse sections.)]\r\n\r\nThe extremity of a brass tube, T, 0.5 to 0.6 of a meter in length and\r\nsmaller in diameter than the tube to be gauged, is cut into four narrow\r\nstrips a few centimeters in length. The extremity of each of these\r\nstrips is bent toward the axis of the tube. Two of them, m and m',\r\nopposite each other are made very flexible, and carry, riveted to their\r\nextremities, two steel buttons, the heads of which, placed in the\r\ninterior, have the form of an obtuse quoin with rounded edge directed\r\nperpendicular to the tube's axis. The other extremities of these buttons\r\nare spherical and polished and serve as caliper points in the operation\r\nof measuring. These buttons are given a thickness such that when the\r\nedges of their heads are in contact, the external diameter of the tube\r\nexceeds the distance apart of the two calibrating points by more than\r\none millimeter. But such distance apart is increased within certain\r\nlimits by inserting between the buttons a German silver wedge, L,\r\ncarried by a rod, t, which traverses the entire tube, and which is\r\nmaneuvered by a head, B, fixed to its extremity. This rod carries a\r\nsmall screw, v, whose head slides in a groove, r, in the tube, so as\r\nto limit the travel of the wedge and prevent its rotation. Beneath the\r\nhead, B, the rod is filed so as to give it a plane surface for the\r\nreception of a divided scale. A corresponding slit in the top of the\r\ntube carries the index, I, of the scale. The principal divisions of the\r\nscale have been obtained experimentally, and traced opposite the index\r\nwhen the calibrating points were exactly 7, 8, 9 etc., millimeters\r\napart. As the angle of the wedge is about one tenth, the intervals\r\nbetween these divisions are about one centimeter. These intervals are\r\ndivided into ten parts, each of which corresponds to a variation in\r\ndistance of one tenth of a millimeter.\r\n\r\nTo calibrate a glass tube with this instrument, the tube is laid upon\r\nthe table, the gauge is inserted, and the buttons are introduced into\r\nthe section desired. The flat side of the head, B, being laid on the\r\ntable, arranges, as shown in the figure, the buttons perpendicular to\r\nit. Then the measuring wedge is introduced until a stoppage occurs\r\nthrough the contact of the buttons with the sides of the tube. Finally,\r\ntheir distance apart is read on the scale. Such distance apart will be\r\nthe measure of a diameter or a chord of the tube's section, according as\r\nthe buttons have been kept in the diametral plane or moved out of it. In\r\norder that the operator shall not be obliged to watch the position of\r\nthe line of calibrating buttons in obtaining the diameter, the following\r\narrangement has been devised: The sides of the measuring wedge are filed\r\noff to a certain angle, and the ends of the corresponding strips, d and\r\nd', are bent inward in the form of hooks, whose extremities always rest\r\non the faces of the directing wedges. The length of these hooks and the\r\nangle of the wedge are such that the distance apart of the rounded backs\r\nof the directing strips is everywhere less, by about one-thirtieth, than\r\nthat of the calibrating buttons. From this it will be seen that if the\r\nwedge be drawn back, and inserted again after the tube has been turned,\r\nwe shall measure the diameter that is actually vertical. It becomes\r\npossible, then, to determine the greatest and smallest diameters in a\r\nfew minutes; and, supposing the section elliptical, its area will be\r\nobtained by multiplying the product of these two diameters by pi/4.\r\n\r\nFrom the description here given it will be seen that Colonel Goulier's\r\napparatus is not only convenient to use, but also permits of obtaining\r\nas accurate results as are necessary. Two sizes of the instrument are\r\nmade, one for diameters of from 7 to 10.5 mm., and the other for those\r\nof from 10 to 15.5 mm. It is the former of these that is shown, of\r\nactual size, in the cuts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLDERING WITHOUT AN IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following method for soldering without the use of a soldering iron\r\nis given in the _Techniker_:\r\n\r\nThe parts to be joined are made to fit accurately, either by filing\r\nor on a lathe. The surfaces are moistened with the soldering fluid, a\r\nsmooth piece of tin foil laid on, and the pieces pressed together and\r\ntightly wired. The article is then heated over the fire or by means of\r\na lamp until the tin foil melts. In this way two pieces of brass can be\r\nsoldered together so nicely that the joint can scarcely be found.\r\n\r\nWith good soft solder, nearly all kinds of soldering can be done over\r\na lamp without the use of a \"copper.\" If several piaces have to\r\nbe soldered on the same piece, it is well to use solder of unlike\r\nfusibility. If the first piece is soldered with fine solder composed of\r\n2 parts of lead, 1 of tin, and 2 of bismuth, there is no danger of its\r\nmelting when another place near it is soldered with bismuth solder, made\r\nof 4 parts of lead, 4 of tin, and 1 of bismuth, for their melting points\r\ndiffer so much that the former will not melt when the latter does. Many\r\nsolders do not form any malleable compounds.\r\n\r\nIn soldering together brass, copper, or iron, hard solder must be\r\nemployed; for example, a solder made of equal parts of brass and silver\r\n(!). For iron, copper, or brass of high melting point, a good solder is\r\nobtained by rolling a silver coin out thin, for it furnishes a tenacious\r\ncompound, and one that is not too expensive, since silver stretches out\r\nwell. Borax is the best flux for hard soldering. It dissolves the oxides\r\nwhich form on the surface of the metal, and protects it from further\r\noxidation, so that the solder comes into actual contact with the\r\nsurfaces of the metal. For soft soldering, the well-known fluid, made by\r\nsaturating equal parts of water and hydrochloric acid with zinc, is to\r\nbe used. In using common solder rosin is the cheapest and best flux. It\r\nalso has this advantage, that it does not rust the article that it is\r\nused on.--_Deutsche Industrie Zeitung_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING COPPER ORES AT SPENCEVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a letter in the Grass Valley _Tidings_ we make the following\r\nextracts:\r\n\r\nThe Spenceville Copper Mining Company have 43 acres of copper-bearing\r\nground and 100 acres of adjoining land, which was bought for the timber.\r\nThere are a hoisting works, mill, roasting sheds, and leaching vats on\r\nthe ground, and they cover several acres.\r\n\r\nOn going around with Mr. Ellis, the first place we came to was the mine\r\nproper, which is simply an immense opening in the ground covering about\r\none half of an acre, and about 80 feet deep. It has an incline running\r\ndown into it, by which the ore is hoisted to the surface. Standing on\r\nthe brink of this opening and looking down, we could see the men at\r\nwork, some drilling, others filling and running the cars to the incline\r\nto be hoisted to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe ore is found in a sort of chloritic slate and iron pyrites which\r\nfollow the ledge all around. The ore itself is a fine-grained pyrite,\r\nwith a grayish color, and it is well suited by its sulphur and low\r\ncopper contents, as well as by its properties for heap roasting. In heap\r\nroasting, the ore is hand-broken by Chinamen into small lumps before\r\nbeing hoisted to the surface. From the landing on the surface it is run\r\nout on long tracks under sheds, dumped around a loose brick flue and on\r\na few sticks of wood formed in the shape of a V, which runs to the flues\r\nto give a draught. Layers of brush are put on at intervals through the\r\npile. The smaller lumps are placed in the core of the heap, the larger\r\nlumps thrown upon them, and 40 tons of tank residues thrown over all to\r\nexclude excess of air; 500 lb. of salt is then distributed through the\r\npile, and it is then set afire. After well alight the draught-holes are\r\nclosed up, and the pile is left to burn, which it does for six months.\r\nAt the expiration of that time the pile is broken into and sorted, the\r\nimperfectly roasted ore is returned to a fresh roast-heap, and the rest\r\ntrammed to the\r\n\r\n\r\nLEACH-VATS.\r\n\r\nThese are 50 in number, 10 having been recently added. The first 40 are\r\nfour feet by six feet and four feet deep, the remaining 10 twice as\r\nlarge. About two tons of burnt ore is put in the small vats (twice as\r\nmuch in the larger ones), half the vats being tilled at one time, and\r\nthen enough cold water is turned in to cover the ore. Steam is then\r\ninjected beneath the ore, thus boiling the water. After boiling for some\r\ntime, the steam is turned off and the water allowed to go cold. The\r\nwater, which after the boiling process turns to a dark red color, is\r\nthen drawn off. This water carries the copper in a state of solution.\r\nThe ore is then boiled a second time, after which the tank residues are\r\nthrown out and water kept sprinkling over them. This water collects the\r\ncopper still left in the residues, and is then run into a reservoir, and\r\nfrom the reservoirs still further on into settling tanks, previous to\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECIPITATION,\r\n\r\nand is then conducted through a system of boxes filled with scrap iron,\r\nthus precipitating the copper.\r\n\r\nThe richer copper liquors which have been drawn from the tanks fire not\r\nallowed to run in with that which comes from the dump heaps. This liquor\r\nis also run into settling tanks, and from them pumped into four large\r\nbarrels, mounted horizontally on friction rollers, to which a very slow\r\nmotion is given. These barrels are 18 feet long and six feet six inches\r\ndeep outside measure. They are built very strongly, and are water-tight.\r\nTen tons of scrap iron are always kept in each of these barrels, which\r\nare refilled six times daily, complete precipitation being effected in\r\nless than four hours. Each barrel is provided with two safety valves,\r\ninserted in the heads, which open automatically to allow the escape of\r\ngas and steam. The precipitation of the copper in the barrels forms\r\ncopper cement. This cement is discharged from the barrels on to screens\r\nwhich hold any lumps of scrap iron which may be discharged with the\r\ncement. It is then dried by steam, after which it is conveyed into\r\nanother tank, left to cool, and then placed in bags ready for shipment,\r\nas copper cement. The building in which the liquor is treated is the\r\nmill part of the property, from which they send out 42 tons monthly of\r\nan average of 85 per cent, of copper cement, this being the average\r\nyield of the mine.\r\n\r\nThere are 23 white men and 40 Chinamen employed at the mine and the\r\nmill. There are also several wood choppers, etc., on the company's\r\npay-roll. Eight months' supply of ore is always kept on hand, there\r\nnow being 12,000 tons roasting. The mine is now paying regular monthly\r\ndividends, and everything argues well for the continuance of the same.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM THOMSON'S PILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thomson pile, which is employed with success for putting in action\r\nthe siphon recorder, and which is utilized in a certain number of cases\r\nin which an energetic and constant current is needed, is made in two\r\nforms. We shall describe first the one used for demonstration. Each\r\nelement of this (Fig. 1) consists of a disk of copper placed at the\r\nbottom of a cylindrical glass vessel, and of a piece of zinc in the form\r\nof a grating placed at the upper part, near the surface of the solution.\r\nA glass tube is placed vertically in the solution, its lower extremity\r\nresting on the copper. Into this tube are thrown some crystals of\r\nsulphate of copper, which dissolve in the liquid, and form a solution of\r\na greater density than that of the zinc alone, and which, consequently,\r\ncannot reach the zinc by diffusion. In order to retard the phenomenon of\r\ndiffusion, a glass siphon containing a cotton wick is placed with one of\r\nits extremities midway between the copper and zinc, and the other in\r\na vessel outside the element, so that the liquid is sucked up slowly\r\nnearly to its center. The liquid is replaced by adding from the top\r\neither water or a weak solution of sulphate of zinc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE THOMSON PILE.(Type for demonstration.)]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the sulphate of copper that rises through the liquid\r\nby diffusion is carried off by the siphon before reaching the zinc, the\r\nlatter being thus surrounded with an almost pure solution of sulphate\r\nof copper having a slow motion from top to bottom. This renewal of the\r\nliquid is so much the more necessary in that the saturated solution of\r\nsulphate of copper has a density of 1.166, and the sulphate of zinc\r\none of 1.445, There would occur, then, a mixture through inversion of\r\ndensities if the solution were allowed to reach a too great amount of\r\nsaturation, did not the siphon prevent such a phenomenon by sucking up\r\nthe liquid into the part where the mixture tends to take place. The\r\nchemical action that produces the current is identical with that of the\r\nDaniell element.\r\n\r\nIn its application, this pile is considerably modified in form\r\nand arrangement. Each element (Fig 2) consists of a flat wooden\r\nhopper-shaped trough, about fifty centimeters square, lined with sheet\r\nlead to make it impervious. The bottom is covered with a sheet of copper\r\nand above this there is a zinc grate formed of closely set bars that\r\nallow the liquid to circulate. This grate is provided with a rim which\r\nserves to support a second similar element, and the latter a third,\r\nand soon until there are ten of the elements superposed to form series\r\nmounted for tension. The weight of the elements is sufficient to secure\r\na proper contact between the zinc and copper of the elements placed\r\nbeneath them, such contact being established by means of a band of\r\ncopper cut out of the sheet itself, and bent over the trough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE THOMSON PILE. (Siphon Recorder Type.)]\r\n\r\nOn account of the large dimensions of the elements, and the proximity\r\nof the two metals, a pile is obtained whose internal resistance is very\r\nfeeble, it being always less than a tenth of an ohm when the pile is\r\nin a good state, and the electromotive force being that of the Daniell\r\nelement--about 1 08 volts.\r\n\r\nSometimes the zinc is covered with a sheet of parchment which more\r\nthoroughly prevents a mixture of the liquids and a deposit of copper on\r\nthe zinc. But such a precaution is not indispensable, if care be taken\r\nto keep up the pile by taking out some of the solution of sulphate of\r\nzinc every day, and adding sulphate of copper in crystals. If the pile\r\nis to remain idle for some time, it is better to put it on a short\r\ncircuit in order to use up all the sulphate of copper, the disappearance\r\nof which will be ascertained by the loss of blue color in the liquid. In\r\ncurrent service, on the contrary, a disappearance of the blue color will\r\nindicate an insufficiency of the sulphate, and will be followed by a\r\nconsiderable reduction in the effects produced by the pile.\r\n\r\nThe great power of this pile, and its constancy, when it is properly\r\nkept up, constitute features that are indispensable for the proper\r\nworking of the siphon recorder--the application for which it was more\r\nespecially designed.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus has been also employed under some circumstances for\r\nproducing an electric light and charging accumulators; but such\r\napplications are without economic interest, seeing the enormous\r\nconsumption of sulphate of copper during the operation of the pile.\r\nThe use of the apparatus is only truly effective in cases where it is\r\nnecessary to have, before everything else, an energetic and exceedingly\r\nconstant current.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIEMENS' TELEMETER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut illustrates a telemeter which was exhibited at the\r\nParis Exhibition of Electricity, and which is particularly interesting\r\nfrom the fact that it is the first apparatus of this kind. It will be\r\nremembered that the object of a telemeter is to make known at any moment\r\nwhatever the distance of a movable object, and that, too, by a direct\r\nreading and without any calculation. In Mr. Siemens' apparatus the\r\nproblem is solved in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThe movable object (very often a vessel) is sighted from two different\r\nstations--two points of the coast, for example--by two different\r\nobservers. The sighting is done with two telescopes, A1 and A2, which\r\nthe observers revolve around a vertical axis by means of two winches, K1\r\nand K2, that gear with two trains of clockwork. There is thus constantly\r\nformed a large triangle, having for its apices the movable point sighted\r\nand the vertical axes, A1 and A2, of the two telescopes. On another\r\nhand, at a point situated between the two telescopes, there is a table,\r\nT T, that carries two alidades, a1v1, and a2v2, movable around their\r\nvertical axes, a1 and a2. The line, a1 a2, that joins these axes is\r\nparallel with that which joins the axes of the two telescopes; and the\r\nalidades are connected electrically with the telescopes by a system\r\nsuch that each alidade always moves parallel with the telescope that\r\ncorresponds to it. It follows from this that the small triangle that\r\nhas for apices, a1 a2, and the crossing point of the two alidades will\r\nalways be like the large triangle formed by the line that joins the\r\ntelescopes and the two lines of vision. If, then, we know the ratio of\r\na1, a2 to A1 A2, it will suffice to measure on one of the alidades the\r\ndistance from its axis to the point of crossing in order to know the\r\ndistance from the movable object to the axis of the corresponding\r\ntelescope. If the table, T T, be covered with a chart giving the space\r\nover which the ship is moving, so that a1 and a2 shall coincide with the\r\npoints which A1 and A2 represent, the crossing of the threads of the\r\nalidades will permit of following on the chart all the ship's movements.\r\nIn this way there maybe had a powerful auxiliary in coast defence; for\r\nall the points at which torpedoes have been sunk may be marked on the\r\nchart, and, as soon as the operator at the table finds, by the motion\r\nof the alidades, that the ship under observation is directly over a\r\ntorpedo, he will be able to fire the latter and blow the enemy up.\r\nDuring this time the two observers at A1 and A2 have only to keep their\r\ntelescopes directed upon the vessel that it has been agreed upon to\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIEMENS' ELECTRIC TELEMETER]\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a parallelism between the motion of the alidades and\r\nthat of the corresponding telescopes, the winch of each of the latter,\r\nwhile putting its instrument in motion, also sets in motion a Siemens\r\ndouble-T armature electromagnetic machine. One of the wires of the\r\narmature of this machine, connected to the frame, is always in\r\ncommunication with the ground at E1 (if we consider, for example, the\r\ntelescope to the left), and the other ends in a spring that alternately\r\ntouches two contacts. One of these contacts communicates with the\r\nwire, L1 and the other with the wire, L3, so that, when the machine is\r\nrevolving, the currents are sent alternately into L1 and L3. These two\r\nlatter wires end in a system of electro magnets, M1, provided with a\r\npolarized armature. The motions of the latter act, through an anchor\r\nescapement, upon a system of wheels. An axle, set in motion by the\r\nlatter, revolves one way or the other, according to the direction of the\r\ntelescope's motions. This axle is provided with an endless screw that\r\ngears with a toothed sector, and the latter controls the rotatory axis\r\nof the alidade. The elements of the toothed wheels and the number of\r\nrevolutions of the armature for a given displacement of the telescope\r\nbeing properly calculated, it will be seen that the alidade will be able\r\nto follow all the movements of the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to place one of the telescopes in a given position\r\n(its position of zero, for example), without acting on the alidade,\r\nit may be done by acting directly on the telescope itself without the\r\nintermedium of the winch. For such purpose it is necessary to interrupt\r\ncommunication with the mechanism by pressing on the button, q. If the\r\ntelescope be turned to one side or the other of its normal position,\r\nin making it describe an angle of 90°, it will abut against stops, and\r\nthese two positions will permit of determining the direction of the\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nThe alidades themselves are provided with a button which disengages the\r\ntoothed sector from the endless screw, and permits of their being\r\nturned to a mark made on the table. A regulating screw permits of this\r\noperation being performed very accurately. In what precedes, we have\r\nsupposed a case in which the movable point is viewed by two observers,\r\nand in which the table, T T, is stationed at a place distant from them.\r\nIn certain cases only two stations are employed. One of the telescopes\r\nis then placed over its alidade and moves with it; and the apparatus\r\nthus comprehends only a system of synchronous movements.\r\n\r\nThis telemeter was one of the first that was tried in our military\r\nports, and gave therein most satisfactory results. The maneuver of the\r\nwinch, however, requires a certain amount of stress, and in order that\r\nthe sending of the currents shall be regular, the operator must turn it\r\nvery uniformly. This is a slight difficulty that has led to the use\r\nof piles, instead of the magneto-electric machine, in the apparatus\r\nemployed in France. With such substitution there is need of nothing more\r\nthan a movable contact that requires no exertion, and that may be guided\r\nby the telescope itself.--_La Lumière Electrique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICS WITHOUT APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Experiment in Static Electricity_.--Take a pipe--a common clay one\r\ncosting one cent--and balance it carefully on the edge of a goblet, so\r\nthat it will oscillate freely at the least touch, like the beam of a\r\nscales. This being done, say to your audience: \"Here is a pipe placed\r\non the edge of a goblet; now the question is to make it fall without\r\ntouching it, without blowing against it, without touching the glass,\r\nwithout agitating the air with a fan, and without moving the supporting\r\ntable\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAY PIPE ATTRACTED BY AN ELECTRIFIED GOBLET.]\r\n\r\nThe problem thus proposed may be solved by means of electricity. Take a\r\ngoblet like the one that supports the pipe, and rub it briskly against\r\nyour coat sleeve, so as to electrify the glass through friction. Having\r\ndone this, bring the goblet to within about a centimeter of the pipe\r\nstem. The latter will then be seen to be strongly attracted, and will\r\nfollow the glass around and finally fall from its support.\r\n\r\nThis curious experiment is a pretty variation of the electric pendulum;\r\nand it shows that pipe-clay--a very bad conductor of electricity--favors\r\nvery well the attraction of an electrified body.\r\n\r\nTumblers or goblets are to be found in every house, and a clay pipe\r\nis easily procured anywhere. So it would be difficult to produce\r\nmanifestations of electricity more easily and at less expense than by\r\nthe means here described.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASCADE BATTERY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Lately read before the Society of Telegraph Engineers and\r\nElectricians.]\r\n\r\nBy F. HIGGINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battery which I have brought here to-night to introduce to your\r\nnotice is of the circulating kind, in which the alimentary fluid\r\nemployed passes from cell to cell by gravitation, and maintains the\r\naction of the battery as long as it continues to flow. It cannot,\r\nof course, compare with such abundant sources of electricity as\r\ndynamo-electric machines driven by steam power, but for purposes in\r\nwhich a current of somewhat greater volume and constancy than that\r\nfurnished by the ordinary voltaic batteries is required, it will, I\r\nbelieve, be found in some cases useful. A single fluid is employed, and\r\neach cell is provided with an overflow spout.\r\n\r\nThe cells are arranged upon steps, in order that the liquid may flow\r\nfrom the cell on the topmost step through each successive cell by\r\ngravitation [specimen cells were on the table before the audience] to\r\nthe reservoir at the bottom. The top and the bottom reservoirs are of\r\nequal capacity, and are fitted with taps. The topmost tap is used to\r\nregulate the flow of the solution, and the bottom one to draw it off. In\r\neach cell two carbon plates are suspended above a quantity of fragments\r\nof amalgamated zinc. The following is a sectional drawing of the\r\narrangement of the cell:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA copper wire passes down to the bottom of the cell and makes connection\r\nwith the mercury; this wire is covered with gutta-percha, except where\r\nimmersed in the mercury. The pores of the carbon plates are filled\r\nwith paraffin wax. This battery was first employed for the purpose of\r\nutilizing waste solution from bichromate batteries, a great quantity of\r\nwhich is thrown away before having been completely exhausted. This waste\r\nis unavoidable, in consequence of the impossibility of permitting such\r\nbatteries, when employed for telegraphic purposes, to run until complete\r\nexhaustion or reduction of the solutions has been effected; therefore\r\nsome valuable chemicals have to be sacrificed to insure constancy in\r\nworking. The fragments of zinc in this cell were also the remains of\r\namalgamated zinc plates from the bichromate batteries, and the mercury\r\nwhich is employed for securing good metallic connection is soon\r\naugmented by that remaining after the dissolution of the zinc. It will\r\ntherefore be seen that not only the solution, but also the zinc and\r\nmercury remnants of bichromate batteries are utilized, and at the same\r\ntime a considerable quantity of electricity is generated. The cells are\r\nseven inches deep and six inches wide, outside, and contain about a\r\nquart of solution in addition to the plates. The battery which I employ\r\nregularly, consisting of 18 cells, is at present working nine permanent\r\ncurrent Morse circuits, which previously required 250 telegraphic\r\nDaniell cells to produce the same effect, and is capable of working at\r\nleast ten times the number of circuits which I have mentioned; but as we\r\ndo not happen to have any more of such permanent current Morse circuits,\r\nwe are unable to make all the use possible of the capabilities of the\r\nbattery. The potential of one cell is from 1.9 to 2 volts with strong\r\nsolution, and the internal resistance varies from 0.108 to 0.170 of an\r\nohm with cells of the size described. In order to test the constancy of\r\nthe battery, a red heat was maintained in a platinum-iridium wire by the\r\ncurrent for six weeks, both day and night.\r\n\r\nThe absence or exhaustion of the zinc in any one cell in a battery is\r\nindicated by the appearance of a red insoluble chromic salt of mercury,\r\nin a finely divided state, floating in the faulty cell. It is then\r\nnecessary to drop in some pieces of zinc. The state of the zinc supply\r\nmay also be ascertained at any time by feeling about in the cells with a\r\nstick. When not required, the battery may be washed by simply charging\r\nthe top reservoir with water, and leaving it to circulate in the usual\r\nmanner, or the solution may be withdrawn from each cell by a siphon. A\r\nvery small flow of the solution is sufficient to maintain the required\r\ncurrent for telegraphic working, but if the flow be stopped altogether\r\nfor a few hours, no difference is observed in the current, although when\r\nthe current is required to be maintained in a conductor of a few ohms\r\nresistance, as in heating a platinum wire, it is necessary that the\r\ncirculation be maintained [heating a piece of platinum ribbon]. The\r\nbattery furnishing the current for producing the effect you now see is\r\nof five cells, and as that number is reduced down to two, you see a glow\r\nstill appears in the platinum. The platinum strip employed was 5 inches\r\nlong and 1/8 inch wide, its resistance being 0.42 ohm, cold. That gives\r\nan idea of the volume of current flowing. I have twelve electro magnets\r\nin printing instruments joined up on the table, and [joining up the\r\nbattery] you see that the two cells are sufficient to work them. The\r\ntwelve electro-magnets are being worked (by the two cells) in multiple\r\narc at the same time. The current from the cells which heated the\r\nplatinum wire is amply sufficient to magnetize a Thomson recorder. I\r\nhave maintained five inches of platinum ribbon in a red hot state for\r\ntwo hours, in order to make sure that the battery I was about to bring\r\nbefore you was in good order. The cost of working such a battery when\r\nwaste solution cannot be obtained, and it is necessary to use specially\r\nprepared bichromate solution, is about 2¼d. per cell per day, with a\r\ncurrent constantly active in a Thomson recorder circuit, or a resistance\r\nof 1½ ohms per cell; but if only occasionally used, the same quantity of\r\nsolution will last several weeks.\r\n\r\nA comparison of this with another form of constant battery, the Daniell,\r\nas used in telegraphy, shows that six of these cells, with a total\r\nelectromotive force of 12 volts and an internal resistance of 0.84 of\r\nan ohm, cannot be replaced by less than 71 batteries of 10 cells each,\r\nconnected in multiple arc, or for quantity. This result, however large\r\nit may appear, is considerably below that which may be obtained when\r\nworking telegraphic lines. A current of 0.02 weber, or ampere, will work\r\nan ordinary sounder or direct writing Morse circuit; the cascade battery\r\nis capable of working 100 such circuits at the same time, while the\r\ncombined resistance of that number of lines would not be below that in\r\nwhich it is found that the battery is constant in action.\r\n\r\nObjection may be made to the arrangement of the battery on the score of\r\nwaste of zinc by local action, because of the electro positive metal\r\nbeing exposed to the chromic liquid; but if the battery be out of action\r\nand the circulation stopped, the zinc amalgam is protected by the\r\nimmobility of the liquid and the formation of a dense layer of sulphate\r\nof zinc on its surface. When in action, that effect is neutralized from\r\nthe fact that carbon in chromic acid is more highly electro-negative\r\nthan the chromate of mercury formed upon the zinc amalgam, and which\r\nappears to be the cause of the dissolution of the zinc even when\r\namalgamated in the presence of chromic acid. The solution may be\r\nrepeatedly passed through the battery until the absence of the\r\ncharacteristic warmth of color of chromic acid indicates its complete\r\nexhaustion. During a description before the Society of thermo-electric\r\nbatteries some time ago, Mr. Preece mentioned that five of the\r\nthermopiles which were being tried at the Post-Office were doing the\r\nwork of 2,535 of the battery cells previously employed. Thirty of\r\nthe cascade cells would have about the same potential as five such\r\nthermopiles, but would supply three and a half times the current, and be\r\ncapable of doing the work of 8,872 cells if employed upon the universal\r\nbattery system in the same manner as the thermo batteries referred to.\r\n\r\nAlthough this battery will do all that is required for a Thomson\r\nrecorder or a similar instrument much more cheaply in this country than\r\nthe tray battery, and with half the number of cells, I do not think it\r\nwould be the case in distant countries, on account of the difficulty and\r\ncost of transport. A solid compound of chromic and sulphuric acids could\r\nbe manufactured which would overcome this difficulty, if permanent\r\nmagnetic fields for submarine telegraphic instruments continue to be\r\nproduced by electric vortices. In conclusion, and to enable comparisons\r\nto be made, I may mention that the work this battery is capable of\r\nperforming is 732,482 foot pounds, at a total cost of 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[FROM THE SCHOOL JOURNAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECTLY LOVELY PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Laura and Isabel, dressed very stylishly, both with hats on.\r\nEnter hand in hand.\r\n\r\n_Laura_. My dear Isabel, I was so afraid you would not come. I waited\r\nat that horrid station a full half hour for you. I went there early on\r\npurpose, so as to be sure not to miss you.\r\n\r\n_Isabel_. Oh, you sweet girl!\r\n\r\n_L_. Now, sit right down; you must be tired. Just lay your hat there on\r\nthe table, and we'll begin to visit right off. (_Both lay their hats on\r\nthe table and stand near by_.)\r\n\r\n_I_. And how have you been all the ages since we were together at\r\nBoston?\r\n\r\n_L_. Oh, well, dear; those were sweet old school days, weren't they. How\r\nare you enjoying yourself now? You wrote that you were taking lessons in\r\nphilosophy. Tell me how you like it. Is it real sweet?\r\n\r\n_I_ Oh, those I took in the winter were perfectly lovely! It was about\r\nscience, you know, and all of us just doled on science.\r\n\r\n_L_. It must have been nice. What was it about?\r\n\r\n_I_. It was about molecules as much as anything else, and molecules are\r\njust too awfully nice for anything. If there's anything I really enjoy,\r\nit's molecules.\r\n\r\n_L_. Oh, tell me about them, dear. What are molecules?\r\n\r\n_I_. They are little wee things, and it takes ever so many of them, you\r\nknow. They are so sweet! Do you know, there isn't anything but that's\r\ngot a molecule in it. And the professors are so lovely! They explained\r\neverything so beautifully.\r\n\r\n_L_. Oh, how I'd like to have been there!\r\n\r\n_I_. You'd have enjoyed it ever so much. They teach protoplasm, too,\r\nand if there's one thing that is too sweetly divine, it's protoplasm. I\r\nreally don't know which I like best, protoplasm or molecules.\r\n\r\n_L_. Tell me about protoplasm. I know I should adore it!\r\n\r\n_I_. 'Deed you would. It's just too sweet to live. You know it's about\r\nhow things get started, or something of that kind. You ought to have\r\nheard the professors tell about it. Oh. dear! (_Wipes her eyes with\r\nhandkerchief_) The first time he explained about protoplasm there wasn't\r\na dry eye in the room. We all named our hats after the professors. This\r\nis a Darwinian hat. You see the ribbon is drawn over the crown this way\r\n(_takes hat and illustrates_), and caught with a buckle and bunch of\r\nflowers. Then you turn up the side with a spray of forget me-nots.\r\n\r\n_L_. Oh, how utterly sweet! Do tell me some more of science. I adore it\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n_I_. Do you, dear? Well, I almost forgot about differentiation. I am\r\nreally and truly positively in love with differentiation. It's different\r\nfrom molecules and protoplasms, but it's every bit as nice. And our\r\nprofessor! You should hear him enthuse about it; he's perfectly bound up\r\nin it. This is a differentiation scarf--they've just come out. All\r\nthe girls wear them--just on account of the interest we take in\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\n_L_. What is it, anyway?\r\n\r\n_I_. Mull trimmed with Languedoc lace, but--\r\n\r\n_L_. I don't mean that--the other.\r\n\r\n_I_. Oh, differentiation! That's just sweet. It's got something to\r\ndo with species. And we learn all about ascidians, too. They are the\r\ndivinest things! If I only had an ascidian of my own! I wouldn't ask\r\nanything else in the world.\r\n\r\n_L_. What do they look like, dear? Did you ever see one?\r\n\r\n_I_. Oh, no; nobody ever did but the poor dear professors; but they're\r\nsomething like an oyster with a reticule hung on its belt. I think they\r\nare just _too_ lovely for anything.\r\n\r\n_L_. Did you learn anything else besides?\r\n\r\n_I_. Oh, yes. We studied common philosophy, and logic, and metaphysics,\r\nand a lot of those ordinary things, but the girls didn't care anything\r\nabout those. We were just in ecstasies over differentiations, and\r\nmolecules, and the professor, and protoplasms, and ascidians. I don't\r\nsee why they put in those common branches; we couldn't hardly endure\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_L_. (_Sighs_.) Do you believe they'll have a course like that next\r\nyear?\r\n\r\n_I_. I think may be they will.\r\n\r\n_L_. Dear me! There's the bell to dress for dinner. How I wish I could\r\nstudy those lovely things!\r\n\r\n_I_. You must ask your father if you can't spend the winter in Boston\r\nwith me. I'm sure there'll be another course of Parlor Philosophy next\r\nwinter. But how dreadful that we must stop talking about it now to dress\r\nfor dinner! You are going to have company, you said; what shall you\r\nwear, dear?\r\n\r\n_L_. Oh, almost anything. What shall you?\r\n\r\n(_Exeunt arm in arm_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSED DUTCH INTERNATIONAL COLONIAL AND GENERAL EXPORT EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amsterdam International Exhibition, the opening of which has been\r\nfixed for May 1, 1883, is now in way of realization. This exhibition\r\nwill present a special interest to all nations, and particularly to\r\ntheir export trade. Holland, which is one of the great colonial powers,\r\nproposes by means of this affair to organize a competition between the\r\nvarious colonizing nations, and to contribute thus to a knowledge of\r\nthe resources of foreign countries whose richness of soil is their\r\nfundamental power.\r\n\r\nThe executive committee includes the names of some of the most prominent\r\npersons of the Netherlands: M. Cordes, president; M. de Clercq,\r\ndelegate; M. Kappeyne van di Coppello, secretary; and M. Agostini,\r\ncommissary general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE DUTCH INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n   1. Exhibition Palace.\r\n   2. Netherlands Colonial Exhibition.\r\n   3.

A\r\nColonial exhibition. 2. A General Export exhibition. 3. A Retrospective\r\nexhibition of Fine Arts and of Arts applied to the Industries. 4.\r\nSpecial exhibitions. 5. Lectures and Scientific Reunions.\r\n\r\nThe colonial part forms the base of the exhibition, and will be devoted\r\nto a comparative study of the different systems of colonization\r\nand colonial agriculture, as well as of the manners and customs of\r\nultramarine peoples. In giving an exact idea of what has been done, it\r\nwill indicate what remains to be done from the standpoint of a general\r\ndevelopment of commerce and manufactures. Such is the programme of the\r\nfirst division.\r\n\r\nThe second division will include everything that relates to the export\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe third division will be reserved for works of art dating back from\r\nthe most remote ages.\r\n\r\nThe fourth division will be devoted to temporary exhibitions, such as\r\nthose of horticultural and agricultural products, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fifth division will constitute the intellectual part, so to speak,\r\nof the exhibition. It will be devoted to lectures, and to scientific\r\nmeetings for the discussion of questions relating to teaching, to the\r\narts, to the sciences, to hygiene, to international jurisprudence, and\r\nto political economy. Questions of colonial economy will naturally\r\noccupy the first rank.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, the programme of this grand scheme organized by the\r\nNetherlands government is a broad one; and, owing the experience\r\nacquired in recent universal exhibitions, especially that of Paris in\r\n1878, very happy results may be expected from it.\r\n\r\nAt present, we give an illustration showing the general plan of the\r\nexhibition. In future, in measure as the work proceeds, we shall be able\r\nto give further details.--_Le Genie Civil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW METHOD OF DETECTING DYES ON YARNS AND TISSUES.\r\n\r\nBy JULES JOFFRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reagents employed are a solution of caustic potassa in ten parts\r\nof water; hydrochloric acid diluted with an equal bulk of water, or\r\noccasionally concentrated; nitric acid, ammonia, ferric sulphate, and\r\na concentrated solution of tin crystals. The most convenient method of\r\noperating is to steep small portions of the cloth under examination in a\r\nlittle of the reagent placed at the bottom of a porcelain capsule. The\r\nbits are then laid on the edge of the capsule, when the changes of color\r\nwhich they have undergone may be conveniently observed. It is useful to\r\nsubmit to the same reagents simultaneously portions of cloth dyed in a\r\nknown manner with the wares which are suspected of having been used in\r\ndyeing the goods under examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED COLORS.\r\n\r\nBy the action of caustic potassa, the reds are divided into four groups:\r\n1, those which turn to a violet or blue; 2, those which turn brown;\r\n3, those which are changed to a light yellow or gray; 4, those which\r\nundergo little or no change.\r\n\r\nThe first group comprises madder, cochineal, orchil, alkanet, and\r\nmurexide. Madder reds are turned to an orange by hydrochloric acid,\r\nwhile the three next are not notably affected. Cochineal is turned by\r\nthe potassa to a violet-red, orchil to a violet-blue, and alkanet to a\r\ndecided blue. Lac-dye presents the same reactions as cochineal, but\r\nhas less brightness. Ammoniacal cochineal and carmine may likewise be\r\ndistinguished by the tone of the reds obtained.\r\n\r\nA characteristic of madder reds is that, after having been turned yellow\r\nby hydrochloric acid, they are rendered violet on treatment with milk\r\nof lime. A boiling soap-lye restores the original red, though somewhat\r\npaler. Artificial alizarine gives the same reaction. Turkey-reds,\r\nhowever, are quite unaffected by acid. Garancine and garanceux reds, if\r\ntreated first with hydrochloric acid and then with milk of lime, turn to\r\na dull blue.\r\n\r\nMadder dyes are sometimes slow in being turned to a violet by potassa,\r\nand this shade when produced is often brownish. They might thus be\r\nconfounded with the dyes of the fourth group, i.e., rosolic acid,\r\ncoralline, eosine, and coccine. None of these colors gives the\r\ncharacteristic reaction with milk of lime and boiling soap-lye. If\r\nplunged in milk of lime, they resume their rose or orange shades, while\r\nthe madder colors become violet. Murexide is turned, by potassa, gray\r\nin its light shades and violet in its dark ones. It might, then, be\r\nconfounded with orchil, but it is decolorized by hydrochloric acid,\r\nwhich leaves orchil a red. Moreover, it is turned greenish by stannous\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\nA special character of this dye (murexide) is the presence of mercury,\r\nthe salts of which serve as mordants for fixing it, and may be detected\r\nby the ordinary reagents.\r\n\r\nThe second group comprises merely sandal wood or sanders red, which\r\nturns to a brown. On boiling it with copperas it becomes violet, while\r\non boiling with potassium dichromate it changes to a yellowish brown.\r\n\r\nThe third group includes safflower, magenta, and murexide (light\r\nshades). If the action of the potassa is prolonged the (soft) red woods\r\nenter into this group. Safflower turns yellow by the action of potassa,\r\nand the original rose shade is not restored by washing with water.\r\nHydrochloric acid turns it immediately yellow. Citric acid has no\r\naction. Magenta is completely decolorized by potassa, but a prolonged\r\nwashing in water reproduces the original shade. This reaction is common\r\nto many aniline colors. These decolorations and recolorations are easily\r\nproduced in dark shades, while in very light shades they are less easily\r\nobserved, because there is always a certain loss of color. Stannous\r\nchloride turns magenta reds to a violet. Hydrochloric acid renders them\r\nyellowish brown (afterward greenish?). Water restores the purple red\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nThe fourth group comprises saffranine, azo-dinaphthyldiamine, rosolic\r\nacid, coralline, pure eosine and cosine modified by a salt of lead,\r\ncoccina, artificial ponceau, and red-wood.\r\n\r\nSaffranine is detected by the action of hydrochloric acid, which turns\r\nit to a beautiful blue; the red color is restored by washing in water.\r\nAzo-dinaphthyl diamine is recognized by its peculiar orange cast, and is\r\nturned by hydrochloric acid to a dull, dirty violet. Rosolic acid and\r\ncoralline, as well as eosine, are turned by hydrochloric acid to an\r\norange-yellow: the two former are distinguished from eosine by their\r\nshade, which inclines to a yellow. Potassa turns rosolic acid and\r\ncoralline from an orange-red to a bright red, while it produces no\r\nchange in eosine. If the action of potassa is prolonged, modified eosine\r\nis blackened in consequence of the decomposition of the wool, the\r\nsulphur of which forms lead sulphide. Coccine becomes of a light\r\nlemon-yellow on treatment with hydrochloric acid. Washing with water\r\nrestores the original shade. It affords the same reactions as eosine,\r\nbut its tone is more inclined to an orange.\r\n\r\nArtificial ponceau does not undergo any change on treatment with\r\nhydrochloric acid, and resists potash. Red wood shades are turned toward\r\na gooseberry-red by hydrochloric acid, especially if strong. This last\r\nreaction not being very distinct, red-wood shades might be mistaken\r\nfor those of artificial ponceau but for the superior brightness of the\r\nlatter. If the action of potassa is prolonged, the red-wood shades\r\nare decolorized, and a washing with water then bleaches the tissue.\r\nRocelline affords the same reactions as artificial ponceau, but if\r\nsteeped in a concentrated solution of stannous chloride it is in time\r\ncompletely discharged, which is not the case with artificial ponceau.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET COLORS.\r\n\r\nViolets are divided into two groups: those affected by potassa, and\r\nthose upon which it has no action. The first group embraces logwood,\r\norchil, alkanet, and aniline violets, including under the latter term\r\nPerkin's violet, (probably the original \"mauve\"), dahlia, Parme or\r\nmagenta violet, methyl, and Hofmann's violets. The action of potassa\r\ngives indications for each of these violets. Logwood violet is browned;\r\nthat of orchil, if slightly reddish, is turned to a blue-violet; that of\r\nalkanet is modified to a fine blue. Lastly, Perkin's mauve, dahlia, and\r\nmethyl violet become of a grayish brown, which may be re-converted into\r\na fine violet by washing in abundance of water. When the shades are\r\nvery heavy, this grayish brown is almost of a violet-brown, so that the\r\nviolets might seem to be unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe action of hydrochloric acid distinguishes these colors better still\r\nif the aid of ammonia is called in for two cases.\r\n\r\nThe acid turns logwood violet to a fine red, and equally reddens orchil\r\nviolet. But the two colors cannot be confounded, first, because the two\r\nviolet shades are very distinct, that of orchil being much the brighter;\r\nand secondly, because ammonia has no action on logwood violet, while it\r\nturns orchil violet, if at all reddish, to a blue shade. Hydrochloric\r\nacid, whether dilute or concentrated, is without action on alkanet\r\nviolet. If the acid is dilute, it is equally without action on Perkin's\r\nviolet and dahlia. If it is strong, it turns them blue, and even green\r\nif in excess. Hofmann's violet turns green even with dilute acid, but\r\nprolonged washing restores the original violet shade. Dahlia gives a\r\nmore blue shade than Perkin's mauve. The action of acid is equally\r\ncharacteristic for methyl violet. It becomes green, then yellow. Washing\r\nin water re-converts it first to a green, and then to a violet.\r\n\r\nThe second group includes madder violet, cochineal violet, and the\r\ncompound violet of cochineal and extract of indigo. These three dyes are\r\nthus distinguished: Hydrochloric acid turns the madder violet-orange,\r\nslightly brownish, or a light brown, and it affords the characteristic\r\nreaction of the madder colors described above under reds. Cochineal\r\nviolets are reddened. Sometimes they are decolorized, and become finally\r\nyellow, but do not pass through a brown stage.\r\n\r\nThe compound violet of cochineal and extract of indigo presents this\r\ncharacteristic reaction, that if boiled with very weak solution of\r\nsodium carbonate the liquid becomes blue, rather greenish, while the\r\ncloth becomes a vinous-red--_Moniteur Scientifique.--Chem. News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEVALET'S CONDENSO-PURIFIER FOR GAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condenso-purifier shown in the accompanying cut operates as\r\nfollows: Water is caused to flow over a metallic plate perforated with\r\ninnumerable holes of from one to three millimeters in diameter, and\r\nthen, under this disk, which is exactly horizontal, a current of gas is\r\nintroduced. Under these circumstances the liquid does not traverse the\r\nholes in the plate, but is supported by the gas coming in an opposite\r\ndirection. Provided that the gas has sufficient pressure, it bubbles up\r\nthrough the water and becomes so much the more divided in proportion as\r\nthe holes are smaller and more numerous.\r\n\r\nThe gas is washed by traversing the liquid, and freed from the tar and\r\ncoal-dust carried along with it; while, at the same time, the ammonia\r\nthat it contains dissolves in the water, and this, too, so much the\r\nbetter the colder the latter is. This apparatus, then, permits of\r\nobtaining two results: a mechanical one, consisting in the stoppage of\r\nthe solid matters, and a chemical one, consisting in the stoppage of the\r\nsoluble portions, such as ammonia, sulphureted hydrogen, and carbonic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--CONDENSO-PURIFIER FOR GAS. (Elevation.)]\r\n\r\nThe condenso-purifier consists of three perforated diaphragms, placed\r\none over the other in rectilinear cast-iron boxes. These diaphragms are\r\nmovable, and slide on projections running round the interior of the\r\nboxes. In each of the latter there is an overflow pipe, g, that runs to\r\nthe box or compartment below, and an unperforated plate, f, that slides\r\nover the diaphragm so as to cover or uncover as many of the holes as may\r\nbe necessary. A stream of common water runs in through the funnel, e,\r\nover the upper diaphragm, while the gas enters the apparatus through the\r\npipe, a, and afterward takes the direction shown by the arrows.\r\nReaching the level of the overflow, the water escapes, fills the lower\r\ncompartment, covers the middle diaphragm, then passes through the second\r\noverflow-pipe to cover the lower diaphragm, next runs through the\r\noverflow-pipe of the third diaphragm on to the bottom of the purifier,\r\nand lastly makes its exit, through a siphon. A pressure gauge, having an\r\ninlet for the gas above and below, serves for regulating the pressure\r\nabsorbed for each diaphragm, and which should vary between 0.01 and\r\n0.012 of a meter.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this purifier is visible when the operation is performed\r\nwith an apparatus made externally of glass. The gas is observed to enter\r\nin the form of smoke under the first diaphragm, and the water to become\r\ndiscolored and tarry. When the gas traverses the second diaphragm, it is\r\nobserved to issue from the water entirely colorless, while the latter\r\nbecomes slightly discolored, and finally, when it traverses the third\r\ndiaphragm, the water is left perfectly limpid.\r\n\r\nTwo diaphragms have been found sufficient to completely remove the solid\r\nparticles carried along by the gas, the third producing only a chemical\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus may replace two of the systems employed in gas works: (1)\r\nmechanical condensers, such as the systems of Pelouze & Audouin, and\r\nof Servier; and (2) scrubbers of different kinds and coke columns.\r\nNevertheless, it is well to retain the last named, if the gas works have\r\nthem, but to modify their work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--PLAN VIEW WITH BY-PASS.]\r\n\r\nThis purifier should always be placed directly after the condensers, and\r\nis to be supplied with a stream of pure water at the rate of 50 liters\r\nof water per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. Such water passes only once into\r\nthe purifier, and issues therefrom sufficiently rich in ammonia to be\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nIf there are coke columns in the works, they are placed after the\r\npurifier, filled with wood shavings or well washed gravel, and then\r\nsupplied with pure cold water in the proportion stated above. The water\r\nthat flows from the columns passes afterward into the condenso-purifier,\r\nwhere it becomes charged with ammonia, and removes from the gas the tar\r\nthat the latter has carried along, and then makes its exit and goes to\r\nthe decanting cistern.\r\n\r\nIn operating thus, all the remaining ammonia that might have escaped the\r\ncondenso-purifier is removed, and the result is obtained without pumps\r\nor motor, with apparatus that costs but little and does not occupy much\r\nspace. The advantages that are derived from this, as regards sulphate\r\nof ammonia, are important; for, on treating ammoniacal waters with\r\ncondensers, scarcely more than four to five kilogrammes of the sulphate\r\nare obtained per ton of coal distilled, while by washing the gas\r\nperfectly with the small quantity of water indicated, four to five\r\nkilogrammes more can be got per 1,000 kilogrammes of coal, or a total of\r\neight to ten kilogrammes per ton.\r\n\r\nWhen the gas is not washed sufficiently, almost all of the ammonia\r\ncondenses in the purifying material.\r\n\r\nThe pressure absorbed by the condenso purifier is from ten to twelve\r\nmillimeters per washing-diaphragm. In works that are not provided with\r\nan extractor, two diaphragms, or even a single one, are employed when it\r\nis desired simply to catch the tar.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus under consideration was employed in the St. Quentin\r\ngas works during the winter of 1881-1882, without giving rise to any\r\nobstruction; and, besides, it was found that by its use there might be\r\navoided all choking up of the pipes at the works and the city mains\r\nthrough naphthaline.\r\n\r\nIn cases of obstruction, it is very easy to take out the perforated\r\ndiaphragms; this being done by removing the bolts from the piece that\r\nholds the register, f, and then removing the diaphragm and putting in\r\nanother. This operation takes about ten minutes. The advantages of such\r\na mounting of the diaphragms is that it allows the gas manufacturer to\r\nemploy (and easily change) the number of perforations that he finds best\r\nsuited to his needs.\r\n\r\nThese apparatus are constructed for productions of from 1,000 to 100,000\r\ncubic meters of gas per twenty four hours.

W. BEDFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this query can be but one, namely, to inquire whether the\r\nwood creosote offered for sale is a pure article, or not; and if not,\r\nwhat is the impurity present?\r\n\r\nThe relative commercial value of the articles sold as coal tar creosote\r\nand wood creosote disposes of the question as to the latter being\r\npresent in the former article, and we are quite certain that the cheap\r\nvariety is nothing more or less than a phenol or carbolic acid. Wood\r\ncreosote, it has been frequently stated, is adulterated with coal tar\r\ncreosote, or phenol. The object of my experiments has been to prove the\r\nidentity of wood creosote and its freedom from phenol. The following\r\ntests are laid down in various works as conclusive evidence of its\r\npurity, and each has been fully tried with the several samples of wood\r\ncreosote to prove their identity and purity, and also with phenol, sold\r\nas commercial creosote or coal tar creosote, and for comparison with\r\nmixtures of the two, that even small percentages of admixture might be\r\nidentified, should such exist in the wood creosote of the market.\r\n\r\nThe following tests were used:\r\n\r\n1. Equal volumes of anhydrous glycerine and wood creosote make a turbid\r\nmixture, separating on standing. _Phenol dissolves_. If three volumes\r\nof water be added, the separation of the wood creosote is immediate.\r\n_Phenol remains in permanent solution_.\r\n\r\n2. One volume of wood creosote added to two volumes of glycerine; the\r\nformer is not dissolved, but separates on standing. _Phenol dissolves_.\r\n\r\n3. Three parts of a mixture containing 75 per cent, of glycerine and\r\n25 of water to 1 part of wood creosote show no increase of volume of\r\nglycerine, and wood creosote separates. _Phenol dissolves, and forms\r\na clear mixture_. Were any phenol present in the wood creosote, the\r\nincrease in the volume of the glycerine solution, if in a graduated\r\ntube, would distinctly indicate the percentage of phenol present.\r\n\r\n4. Solubility in benzine. Wood creosote entirely soluble. _Phenol is\r\ninsoluble_.\r\n\r\n5. A 1 per cent, solution of wood creosote. Take of this 10 cubic\r\ncentimeters, add 1 drop of a test solution of ferric chloride; an\r\nevanescent blue color is formed, passing quickly into a red color.\r\n_Phenol gives a permanent blue color_.\r\n\r\n6. Collodion or albumen with an equal bulk of wood creosote makes a\r\nperfect mixture without coagulation. _Phenol at once coagulates into a\r\nmore or less firm mass or clot_.\r\n\r\n7. Bromine solution with wood creosote gives a reddish brown\r\nprecipitate. _Phenol gives a white precipitate_.\r\n\r\nAll tests enumerated above were repeatedly tried with four samples of\r\nwood creosote sold as such; one a sample of Morson's, one of Merck's,\r\none evidently of German origin, but bearing the label and capsule of an\r\nAmerican manufacturer, and one of unknown origin, but sold as beech-wood\r\ncreosote (German), and each proved to be _pure wood creosote_.\r\n\r\nTwo samples of commercial creosote which, from the low cost, were known\r\nto be of coal tar origin gave the negative tests, showing that they were\r\nphenol.\r\n\r\nCorroborative experiments were made by mixing 10 to 20 per cent, of\r\nphenol with samples of the beechwood creosote, but in every case each of\r\nthe tests named showed the presence of the phenol.\r\n\r\nThe writer on other occasions applied single tests (the collodion test)\r\nto samples of beechwood creosote that he had an opportunity of procuring\r\nsmall specimens of, and satisfied himself that they were pure. The\r\nconclusion is that the wood creosote of the market of the present time\r\nis in abundant supply, is of unexceptionable quality, and reasonable in\r\nprice, so that there is no excuse for the substitution of the phenol\r\ncommonly sold for it. When it is directed for use for internal\r\nadministration (the medicinal effect being entirely dissimilar), wood\r\ncreosote only should be dispensed.\r\n\r\nThe general sales of creosote by the pharmacist are in small quantities\r\nas a toothache remedy, and phenol has the power of coagulating albumen,\r\nwhich effectually relieves the suffering. Wood creosote does not\r\ncoagulate albumen, and is, therefore, not as serviceable. This is,\r\nperhaps, the reason that it has become, in a great measure, supplanted\r\nin general sale by the coal tar creosote, to say nothing of the argument\r\nof a lower cost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDY FOR SICK HEADACHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgeon Major Roehring, of Amberg, reports, in No. 32 of the _Allg. Med.\r\nCentr. Zeit_., April 22, 1882, a case of headache of long standing,\r\nwhich he cured by salicylate of sodium, which confirms the observations\r\nof Dr. Oehlschlager, of Dantzig, who first contended that we possessed\r\nin salicylic acid one of the most reliable remedies for neuralgia. This\r\ncannot astonish us if we remember that the action of salicylic acid is,\r\nin more than one respect, and especially in its influence on the nervous\r\ncenters, analogous to quinine.\r\n\r\nWhile out with the troops on maneuver, Dr. Roehring was called to visit\r\nthe sixteen-year old son of a poor peasant family in a neighboring\r\nvillage. The boy, who gave all evidences of living under bad hygienic\r\nsurroundings, but who had shown himself very diligent at school, had\r\nbeen suffering, from his sixth year, several days every week from the\r\nmost intense headache, which had not been relieved by any of the many\r\nremedies tried for this purpose. A careful examination did not reveal\r\nany organic lesion or any cause for the pain, which seemed to be\r\nneuralgic in character, a purely nervous headache. Roehring had just\r\nbeen reading the observations of Oehlschlager, and knowing, from the\r\nnames of the physicians who had been already attending the poor boy,\r\nthat all the common remedies for neuralgia had been given a fair trial,\r\nthought this a good opportunity to test the virtue of salicylate of\r\nsodium. He gave the boy, who, in consequence of the severity of the\r\npain, was not able to leave his bed, ten grains of the remedy every\r\nthree hours, and was surprised to see the patient next day in his tent\r\nand with smiling face. The boy admitted that he for years had not been\r\nfeeling so well as he did then. The remedy was continued, but in less\r\nfrequent doses, for a few days longer; the headache did not return.\r\nSeveral months later Dr. Roehring wrote to the school-teacher of the\r\nboy, and was informed that the latter had, during all this time,\r\nbeen totally free of his former pain, that he was much brighter than\r\nformerly, and evidently enjoying the best of health.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to give the remedy a more extensive trial, and the\r\nmore so as we are only too often at a loss what to do in stubborn cases\r\nof so-called nervous headache.--_The Medical and Surgical Reporter_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNLIGHT AND SKYLIGHT AT HIGH ALTITUDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Southampton meeting of the British Association, Captain Abney\r\nread a paper in which he called attention to the fact that photographs\r\ntaken at high altitudes show skies that are nearly black by comparison\r\nwith bright objects projected against them, and he went on to show that\r\nthe higher above the sea level the observer went, the darker the sky\r\nreally is and the fainter the spectrum. In fact, the latter shows but\r\nlittle more than a band in the violet and ultraviolet at a height of\r\n8,500 feet, while at sea-level it shows nearly the whole photographic\r\nspectrum. The only reason of this must be particles of some reflecting\r\nmatter from which sunlight is reflected. The author refers this to\r\nwatery stuff, of which nine-tenths is left behind at the altitude at\r\nwhich be worked. He then showed that the brightness of the ultra-violet\r\nof direct sunlight increased enormously the higher the observer went,\r\nbut only to a certain point, for the spectrum suddenly terminated about\r\n2,940 wave-length. This abrupt absorption was due to extra-atmospheric\r\ncauses and perhaps to space. The increase in brightness of the\r\nultra-violet was such that the usually invisible rays, L, M, N, could be\r\ndistinctly seen, showing that the visibility of these rays depended\r\non the intensity of the radiation. The red and ultra-red part of the\r\nspectrum was also considered. He showed that the absorption lines were\r\npresent in undiminished force and number at this high altitude, thus\r\nplacing their origin to extra-atmospheric causes. The absorption from\r\natmospheric causes of radiant enemy in these parts he showed was due\r\nto \"water-stuff,\" which he hesitated to call aqueous vapor, since the\r\nbanded spectrum of water was present, and not lines. The B and A line he\r\nalso stated could not be claimed as telluric lines, much less as due to\r\naqueous vapor, but must originate between the sun and our atmosphere.\r\nThe author finally confirmed the presence of benzine and ethyl in the\r\nsame region. He had found their presence indicated in the spectrum at\r\nsea-level, and found their absorption lines with undiminished intensity\r\nat 8,500 feet. Thus, without much doubt, hydrocarbons must exist between\r\nour atmosphere and the sun, and, it may be, in space.\r\n\r\nProf. Langley, following Capt. Abney, observed: The very remarkable\r\npaper just read by Captain Abney has already brought information\r\nupon some points which the one I am about, by the courtesy of the\r\nAssociation, to present, leaves in doubt. It will be understood then\r\nthat the references here are to his published memoirs only, and not to\r\nwhat we have just heard.\r\n\r\nThe solar spectrum is so commonly composed to have been mapped with\r\ncompleteness, that the statement that much more than one-half its extent\r\nis not only unmapped but nearly unknown, may excite surprise. This\r\nstatement is, however, I think, quite within the truth, as to that\r\nalmost unexplored region discovered by the elder Herschel, which, lying\r\nbelow the red and invisible to the eye, is so compressed by the prism\r\nthat, though its aggregate heat effects have been studied through the\r\nthermopile, it is only by the recent researches of Capt. Abney that we\r\nhave any certain knowledge of the lines of absorption there, even in\r\npart. Though the last-named investigator has extended our knowledge of\r\nit to a point much beyond the lowest visible ray, there yet remains a\r\nstill remoter region, more extensive than the whole visible spectrum,\r\nthe study of which has been entered on at Alleghany, by means of the\r\nlinear bolometer.\r\n\r\nThe whole spectrum, visible and invisible, is powerfully affected by the\r\nselective absorption of our atmosphere and that of the sun; and we must\r\nfirst observe that could we get outside our earth's atmospheric shell,\r\nwe should see a second and very different spectrum, and could we\r\nafterward remove the solar atmosphere also, we should have yet a third,\r\ndifferent from either. The charts exhibited show:\r\n\r\n1st. The distribution of the solar energy as we receive it, at the\r\nearth's surface, throughout the entire invisible as well as visible\r\nportion, both on the prismatic and normal scales. This is what I have\r\nprincipally to speak of now, but this whole first research is but\r\nincidental to others upon the spectra before any absorption, which\r\nthough incomplete, I wish to briefly allude to later. The other curves\r\nthen indicate:\r\n\r\n2d. The distribution of energy before absorption by our own atmosphere.\r\n\r\n3d. This distribution at the photosphere of the sun. The extent of\r\nthe field, newly studied, is shown by this drawing [chart exhibited].\r\nBetween H in the extreme violet, and A in the furthest red, lies the\r\nvisible spectrum, with which we are familiar, its length being about\r\n4,000 of Angstrom's units. If, then, 4,000 represent the length of the\r\nvisible spectrum, the chart shows that the region below extends through\r\n24,000 more, and so much of this as lies below wave-length 12,000, I\r\nthink, is now mapped for the first time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--PRISMATIC SPECTRUM.]\r\n\r\nWe have to pi = 12,000 relatively complete photographs, published by\r\nCapt. Abney, but, except some very slight indications by Lamansky,\r\nDesains, and Mouton, no further guide.\r\n\r\nDeviations being proportionate to abscissae, and measured solar energies\r\nto ordinates, we have here (1) the distribution of energy in the\r\nprismatic, and (2) its distribution in the normal spectrum. The total\r\nenergy is in each case proportionate to the area of the curve (the two\r\nvery dissimilar curves inclosing the same area), and on each, if the\r\ntotal energy be roughly divided into four parts, one of these will\r\ncorrespond to the visible, and three to the invisible or ultra-red part.\r\nThe total energy at the ultra violet end is so small, then, as to be\r\nhere altogether negligible.\r\n\r\nWe observe that (owing to the distortion introduced by the prism) the\r\nmaximum ordinate representing the heat in the prismatic spectrum is, as\r\nobserved by Tyndall, below the red, while upon the normal scale this\r\nmaximum ordinate is found in the orange.\r\n\r\nI would next ask your attention to the fact that in either spectrum,\r\nbelow pi = 12,000 are most extraordinary depressions and interruptions\r\nof the energy, to which, as will be seen, the visible spectrum offers\r\nno parallel. As to the agent producing these great gaps, which so\r\nstrikingly interrupt the continuity of the curve, and, as you see,\r\nin one place, cut it completely into two, I have as yet obtained no\r\nconclusive evidence. Knowing the great absorption of water vapor in this\r\nlowest region, as we already do, from the observations of Tyndall, it\r\nwould, _a priori_, seem not unreasonable to look to it as the cause. On\r\nthe other hand, when I have continued observations from noon to sunset,\r\nmaking successive measures of each ordinate, as the sinking sun sent its\r\nrays through greater depths of absorbing atmosphere, I have not found\r\nthese gaps increasing as much as they apparently should, if due to a\r\nterrestrial cause, and so far as this evidence goes, they might be\r\nrather thought to be solar. But my own means of investigation are not so\r\nwell adapted to decide this important point as those of photography, to\r\nwhich we may yet be indebted for our final conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--NORMAL SPECTRUM. (At sea level.)]\r\n\r\nI am led, from a study of Capt. Abney's photographs of the region\r\nbetween pi = 8,000 and pi = 12,000, to think that these gaps are\r\nproduced by the aggregation of finer lines, which can best be\r\ndiscriminated by the camera, an instrument which, where it can be used\r\nat all, is far more sensitive than the bolometer; while the latter, I\r\nthink, has on the other hand some advantage in affording direct and\r\ntrustworthy measures of the amount of energy inhering in each ray.\r\n\r\nOne reason why the extent of this great region has been so singularly\r\nunderestimated, is the deceptively small space into which it appears to\r\nbe compressed by the distortion of the prism. To discriminate between\r\nthese crowded rays, I have been driven to the invention of a special\r\ninstrument. The bolometer, which I have here, is an instrument depending\r\nupon principles which I need not explain at length, since all present\r\nmay be presumed to be familiar with the success which has before\r\nattended their application in another field in the hands of the\r\nPresident of this Association.\r\n\r\nI may remark, however, that this special construction has involved very\r\nconsiderable difficulties and long labor. For the instrument here shown,\r\nplatinum has been rolled by Messrs. Tiffany, of New York, into sheets,\r\nwhich, as determined by the kindness of Professor Rood, reach the\r\nsurprising tenuity of less than one twenty-five-thousandth of an English\r\ninch (I have also iron rolled to one fifteen-thousandth inch), and from\r\nthis platinum a strip is cut one one-hundred-and-twenty-fifth of an inch\r\nwide. This minute strip, forming one arm of a Wheatstone's bridge, and\r\nthus perfectly shielded from air currents, is accurately centered by\r\nmeans of a compound microscope in this truly turned cylinder, and the\r\ncylinder itself is exactly directed by the arms of this Y.\r\n\r\nThe attached galvanometer responds readily to changes of temperature, of\r\nmuch less than one-ten-thousandth degree F. Since it is one and the same\r\nsolar energy whose manifestations we call \"light\" or \"heat,\" according\r\nto the medium which interprets them, what is \"light\" to the eye is\r\n\"heat\" to the bolometer, and what is seen as a dark line by the eye is\r\nfelt as a cold line by the sentient instrument. Accordingly, if lines\r\nanalogous to the dark \"Fraunhofer lines\" exist in this invisible region,\r\nthey will appear (if I may so speak) to the bolometer as cold bands, and\r\nthis hair-like strip of platina is moved along in the invisible part of\r\nthe spectrum till the galvanometer indicates the all but infinitesimal\r\nchange of temperature caused by its contact with such a \"cold band.\" The\r\nwhole work, it will be seen, is necessarily very slow; it is in fact a\r\nlong groping in the dark, and it demands extreme patience. A portion of\r\nits results are now before you.\r\n\r\nThe most tedious part of the whole process has been the determination of\r\nthe wave-lengths. It will be remembered that we have (except through the\r\nwork of Capt. Abney already cited, and perhaps of M. Mouton) no direct\r\nknowledge of the wave-lengths in the infra-red prismatic spectrum, but\r\nhave hitherto inferred them from formulas like the well-known one of\r\nCauchy's, all which known to me appear to be here found erroneous by the\r\ntest of direct experiment, at least in the case of the prism actually\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly aided in this part of the work by the remarkable\r\nconcave gratings lately constructed by Prof. Rowland, of Baltimore, one\r\nof which I have the pleasure of showing you. [Instrument exhibited.]\r\n\r\nThe spectra formed by this fall upon a screen in which is a fine slit,\r\nonly permitting nearly homogeneous rays to pass, and these, which may\r\ncontain the rays of as many as four overlapping spectra, are next passed\r\nthrough a rock-salt or glass prism placed with its refracting edge\r\nparallel to the grating lines. This sorts out the different narrow\r\nspectral images, without danger of overlapping, and after their passage\r\nthrough the prism we find them again, and fix their position by means of\r\nthe bolometer, which for this purpose is attached to a special kind of\r\nspectrometer, where its platinum thread replaces the reticule of the\r\nordinary telescope. This is very difficult work, especially in the\r\nlowermost spectrum, where I have spent over two weeks of consecutive\r\nlabor in fixing a single wave-length.\r\n\r\nThe final result is, I think, worth, the trouble, however, for, as you\r\nsee here, we are now able to fix with approximate precision and by\r\ndirect experiment, the wave-length of every prismatic spectral ray. The\r\nterminal ray of the solar spectrum, whose presence has been certainly\r\nfelt by the bolometer, has a wave-length of about 28,000 (or is nearly\r\ntwo octaves below the \"great A\" of Fraunhofer).\r\n\r\nSo far, it appears only that we have been measuring _heat_, but I\r\nhave called the curve that of solar \"energy,\" because by a series of\r\nindependent investigations, not here given, the selective absorption\r\nof the silver, the speculum-metal, the glass, and the lamp-black\r\n(the latter used on the bolometer-strip), forming the agents of\r\ninvestigation, has been separately allowed for. My study of lamp-black\r\nabsorption, I should add in qualification, is not quite complete. I have\r\nfound it quite transparent to certain infra-red rays, and it is very\r\npossible that there may be some faint radiations yet to be discovered\r\neven below those here indicated.\r\n\r\nIn view of the increased attention that is doubtless soon to be given\r\nto this most interesting but strangely neglected region, and which by\r\nphotography and other methods is certain to be fully mapped hereafter, I\r\ncan but consider this present work less as a survey than as a sketch of\r\nthis great new field, and it is as such only that I here present it.\r\n\r\nAll that has preceded is subordinate to the main research, on which I\r\nhave occupied the past two years at Alleghany, in comparing the spectra\r\nof the sun at high and low altitudes, but which I must here touch upon\r\nbriefly. By the generosity of a friend of the Alleghany Observatory, and\r\nby the aid of Gen. Hazen, Chief Signal Officer of the U S. Army, I was\r\nenabled last year to organize an expedition to Mount Whitney in South\r\nCalifornia, where the most important of these latter observations were\r\nrepeated at an altitude of 13,000 feet. Upon my return I made a special\r\ninvestigation upon the selective absorption of the sun's atmosphere,\r\nwith results which I can now only allude to.\r\n\r\nBy such observations, but by methods too elaborate for present\r\ndescription, we can pass from the curve of energy actually observed to\r\nthat which would be seen if the observer were stationed wholly above the\r\nearth's atmosphere, and freed from the effect of its absorption.\r\n\r\nThe salient and remarkable result is the growth of the blue end of the\r\nspectrum, and I would remark that, while it has been long known from\r\nthe researches of Lockyer, Crova, and others that certain rays of short\r\nwave-length were more absorbed than those of long, these charts show\r\n_how much_ separate each ray of the spectrum has grown, and bring, what\r\nseems to me, conclusive evidence of the shifting of the point of maximum\r\nenergy without the atmosphere toward the blue. Contrary to the accepted\r\nbelief, it appears here also that the absorption on the whole grows less\r\nand less, to the extreme infra-red extremity; and on the other hand,\r\nthat the energy before absorption was so enormously greater in the blue\r\nand violet, that the sun must have a decidedly bluish tint to the naked\r\neye, if we could rise above the earth's atmosphere to view it.\r\n\r\nBut even were we placed outside the earth's atmosphere, that surrounding\r\nthe sun itself would still remain, and exert absorption. By special\r\nmethods, not here detailed, we have at Alleghany compared the\r\nabsorption, at various depths, of the sun's own atmosphere for each\r\nspectral ray, and are hence enabled to show, with approximate truth, I\r\nthink for the first time, the original distribution of energy throughout\r\nthe visible and invisible spectrum at the fount of that energy, in the\r\nsun itself. There is a surprising similarity, you will notice, in the\r\ncharacter of the solar and telluric absorptions, and one which we could\r\nhardly have anticipated _a priori_.\r\n\r\nHere, too, violet has been absorbed enormously more than the green, and\r\nthe green than the red, and so on, the difference being so great, that\r\nif we were to calculate the thickness of the solar atmosphere on the\r\nhypothesis of a uniform transmission, we should obtain a very thick\r\natmosphere from the rate of absorption in the infra-red alone, and a\r\nvery thin one from that in the violet alone.\r\n\r\nBut the main result seems to be still this, that as we have seen in the\r\nearth's atmosphere, so we see in the sun's, an enormous and progressive\r\nincrease of the energy toward the shorter wave-lengths. This conclusion,\r\nwhich, I may be permitted to remark, I anticipated in a communication\r\npublished in the _Comptes Rendus_ of the Institute of France as long\r\nsince as 1875, is now fully confirmed, and I may mention that it is so\r\nalso by direct photometric methods, not here given.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we ask how the solar photosphere would appear to the eye,\r\ncould we see it without absorption, these figures appear to show\r\nconclusively that it would be _blue_. Not to rely on any assumption,\r\nhowever, we have, by various methods at Allegheny, reproduced this\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThus (to indicate roughly the principle used), taking three Maxwell's\r\ndisks, a red, green, and blue, so as to reproduce white, we note the\r\nthree corresponding ordinates at the earth's surface spectrum, and,\r\ncomparing these with the same ordinates in the curve giving the energy\r\nat the solar surface, we rearrange the disks, so as to give the\r\nproportion of red, green, and blue which would be seen _there_, and\r\nobtain by their revolution a tint which must approximately represent\r\nthat at the photosphere, and which is most similar to that of a blue\r\nnear Fraunhofer's \"F.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, then, is that, while all radiations emanate from the\r\nsolar surface, including red and infra-red, in greater degree than we\r\nreceive them, the blue end is so enormously greater in proportion that\r\nthe proper color of the sun, as seen at the photosphere is blue--not\r\nonly \"bluish,\" but positively and distinctly blue; a statement which I\r\nhave not ventured to make from any conjecture, or on any less cause than\r\non the sole ground of long continued experiments, which, commenced some\r\nseven years since, have within the past two years irresistibly tended to\r\nthe present conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe mass of observations on which it rests must be reserved for more\r\ndetailed publication elsewhere. At present, I can only thank the\r\nassociation for the courtesy which has given me the much prized\r\nopportunity of laying before them this indication of methods and\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINERALOGICAL LOCALITIES IN AND AROUND NEW YORK CITY, AND THE\r\nMINERALS OCCURRING THEREIN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Continued from SUPPLEMENTS 244 and 246.]\r\n\r\nBy NELSON H. DABTON.\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoboken.--The locality represented here is where the same serpentine\r\nthat we met on Staten Island crops out, and is known as Castle Hill. It\r\nis a prominent object in view when on the Hudson River, lying on Castle\r\nPoint just above the Stevens Institute and about a mile north of the\r\nferry from Barclay or Christopher Street, New York city. Upon it is the\r\nStevens estate, etc., which is ordinarily inaccessible, but below this\r\nand along the river walk, commencing at Fifth Street and to Twelfth,\r\nthere is an almost uninterrupted outcrop from two to thirty feet in\r\nthickness and plentifully interspersed with the veins of the minerals\r\nof the locality, which are very similar to those of Staten Island; the\r\nserpentine, however, presenting quite a different appearance, being of a\r\ndenser and more homogeneous structure and color, and not so brittle or\r\nlight colored as that of Staten Island, but of a pure green color. The\r\nveins of minerals are about a half an inch to--in the case of druses\r\nof magnesite, which penetrate the rock in all proportions and\r\ndirections--even six inches in thickness. They lie generally in a\r\nperpendicular position, but are frequently bent and contorted in every\r\ndirection. They are the more abundant where the rock is soft, as veins,\r\nbut included minerals are more plentiful in the harder rock. There is\r\nhardly any one point on the outcrop that may be said to be favored in\r\nabundance, but the veins of the brucites, dolomite, and magnesites are\r\nscattered at regular and short intervals, except perhaps the last, which\r\nis most plentiful at the north end of the walk.\r\n\r\n_Magnesite_.--This mineral, of which we obtained some fine specimens on\r\nStaten Island, occurs extremely plentifully here, constituting five or\r\nsix per cent. of a large proportion of the rock, and in every imaginable\r\ncondition, from a smooth, even, dark colored mass apparently devoid of\r\ncrystalline form, to druses of very small but beautiful crystals, which\r\nare obtained by selecting a vein with an opening say from a quarter to a\r\nhalf-inch between it and one or, if possible, both points of its contact\r\nwith the inclosing rock, and cutting away the massive magnesite and rock\r\naround it, when fine druses and masses or geodes may be generally found\r\nand carefully cut out. The crystals are generally less than a quarter of\r\nan inch long, and the selection of a cabinet specimen should be based\r\nmore upon their form of aggregation that the size of the crystals.\r\nNearly all the veins hold more or less of these masses through their\r\ntotal extent, but many have been removed, and consequently a careful\r\nsearch over the veins for the above indications, of which there are\r\nstill plenty undeveloped or but partly so, would well repay an hour\r\nor more of cutting into, by the specimens obtained. Patience is an\r\nexcellent and very necessary virtue in searching for pockets of\r\nminerals, and is even more necessary here among the multitudinous barren\r\nveins. One hint I might add, which is of final importance, and the\r\nignorance of which has so far preserved this old locality from\r\nexhaustion, is that every specimen of this kind in the serpentine, of\r\nany great uniqueness, is to be found within five feet from the upper or\r\nsurface end of the vein, which in this locality is inaccessible in the\r\nmore favored parts without a ladder or similar arrangement upon which\r\none may work to reach them. Here the veins will be found to be very far\r\ndisintegrated and cavernous, thus possessing the requisite conditions of\r\noccurrence (this is also true of Staten Island, but there more or less\r\ninaccessible) for this mineral and similar ones that occur in geodes or\r\ndrused incrustations, while it is just _vice versa_ for those occurring\r\nin closely packed veins, as brucite, soapstone, asbestos, etc., where\r\nthey occur in finer specimens, where they are the more compact, which is\r\ndeep underground. This is also partly true of the zeolites and granular\r\nlimestone species with included minerals. I do not think there is any\r\nrule, at least I have not observed it in an extended mineralogical\r\nexperience; but if they favor any part, it is undoubtedly the top, as\r\nin the granular limestone and granite; however, they generally fall\r\nsubordinate to the first principle, as they more frequently, in this\r\nformation, with the exception of chromic iron, occur not in the\r\nserpentine but in the veins therein contained; for instance, crystals\r\nof dolomite are found deeper in the rock as they occur in the denser\r\nsoapstone, which becomes so at a more or less considerable depth, with\r\nspinel, zircon, etc., of the granular limestone. They occur generally in\r\npockets within five feat from the surface, but they can hardly be called\r\nincluded minerals, as they are rather, as their mention suggests,\r\npockets, and adjacent or in contact with the intruded granite or\r\nmetamorphosed rock joining the formation at this point. This is\r\nseemingly at variance when we consider datholite, but when we do find it\r\nin pockets a hundred and fifty feet below the surface, in the Weehawken\r\ntunnel, it is not in the trap, but on the surface of what was a cleft\r\nor empty vein, since filled up with chlorite extending from the surface\r\ndown, while natrolite, etc., by the trap having clefts of such variable\r\nand often great depth, allowed the solution of the portion thus\r\ncontributed that infiltered from the surface easy access to the beds\r\nin which they lie, the mode of access being since filled with densely\r\npacked calcite, which was present in over-abundance. This is not\r\napplicable to serpentine, as the clefts are never of any great depth,\r\nand the five feet before mentioned are a proportionately great depth\r\nfrom the surface. As I mentioned in commencing this paper (Part I),\r\nevery part of the success of a trip lies in knowing where to find the\r\nminerals sought; and by close observation of these relations much more\r\ndirection may be obtained than by my trying to describe the exact point\r\nin a locality where I have obtained them or seen them. There is much\r\nmore satisfaction in finding rich pockets independently of direction,\r\nand by close observance of indications rather than chance, or by having\r\nthem pointed out; for the one that reads this, and goes ahead of you to\r\nthe spot, and either destroys the remainder by promiscuous cuttings, or\r\ncarries them off in bulk, as there are many who go to a locality, and\r\nwhat they cannot carry off they destroy, give you a disappointment in\r\nfinding nothing; consequently, I have considered that this digression\r\nfrom our subject in detail was pardonable, that one may be independent\r\nof the stated parts of the locality, and not too confidently rely on\r\nthem, as I am sometimes disappointed myself in localities and pockets\r\nthat I discover in spare time by finding that some one has been there\r\nbetween times, and carried off the remainder. The characteristics of\r\nmagnesite I have detailed under that head under Pavilion Hill, Staten\r\nIsland; but it may be well to repeat them briefly here. Form as above\r\ndescribed, from a white to darker dirty color. Specific gravity, 2.8-3;\r\nhardness, about 3.5. Before the blowpipe it is infusible, _and not\r\nreduced to quicklime_, which distinguishes it from dolomite, which it\r\nfrequently resembles in the latter's massive form, common here in veins.\r\nIt dissolves in acid readily with but little effervescence, which\r\nlittle, however, distinguishes it from brucite, which it sometimes\r\nresembles and which has a much lower-specific gravity when pure.\r\n\r\n_Dolomite_.--This mineral has been very common in this locality.\r\nIt differs, perhaps, as I have before explained, from magnesite in\r\ncontaining lime besides magnesia, and from calc spar by the _vice\r\nversa_. Much of the magnesite in this serpentine contains more or less\r\nlime, and is consequently in places almost pure dolomite, although\r\ncrystals are seldom to be found in this outcrop, it all occurring as\r\nveins about a half-inch thick and resembling somewhat the gurhofite\r\nof Staten Island, only that it is softer and less homogeneous in\r\nappearance. Its color is slightly tinged green, and specimens of it are\r\nnot peculiarly unique, but perhaps worth removing. Its characteristics\r\nare: first, its burning to quicklime before the blowpipe, distinguishing\r\nit from pure magnesite; second, its slow effervescence in acids. Besides\r\nthese, its specific gravity is 2.8, hardness, 8.5; from calcspar it\r\ncannot be distinguished except by chemical analysis, as the two species\r\nblend almost completely with every intermediate stage of composition\r\ninto either calc spar, or, what occurs in this locality, aragonite,\r\nsimilar in composition to it, or dolomite. The color of the last,\r\nhowever, is generally darker, and it cleaves less readily into its\r\ncrystalline form, which is similar to calc spar, and of which it is\r\nharder, 3.5 to 3 of calc spar.\r\n\r\n_Aragonite_.--This mineral, identical in composition with calc spar, but\r\nwhose crystalline form is entirely different, occurs in this locality in\r\nveins hardly recognizable from the magnesite or dolomite, and running\r\ninto dolomite. It is not abundant, and the veins are limited in extent;\r\nthe only distinguishment it has from the dolomite, practically, is its\r\nfibrous structure, the fibers being brittle and very coarse. If examined\r\nwith a powerful glass, they will be seen to be made up of modified long\r\nprisms. The specific gravity is over 2.9, hardness about 4, unless much\r\nweathered, when it becomes apparently less. There are some small veins\r\nat the north end of the walk, and in them excellent forms may be found\r\nby cutting into the veins.\r\n\r\n_Brucite_.--This mineral occurs here in fair abundance, it being one of\r\nthe principal localities for it in the United States, and where formerly\r\nextremely unique specimens were to be obtained. It has been pretty well\r\nexhausted, however, and the fine specimens are only to be obtained by\r\ndigging into the veins of it in the rock, which are quite abundant on\r\nthe south end of the walk, and, as I before noted, as deep as possible\r\nfrom the top of the veins, as it is a closely packed mineral not\r\noccurring in geodes, druses, etc. Two forms of it occur; the one,\r\nnemalite, is in fibers of a white to brown color resembling asbestos,\r\nbut the fibers are brittle, and hardly as fine as a typical asbestos. It\r\nis packed in masses resembling the brucite, from which it only differs\r\nin breaking into fibers instead of plates, as I have explained in my\r\ndescription of that species (see Part II). They are both readily soluble\r\nin acids, with effervescence, and infusible but crumble to powder before\r\nthe blowpipe, or at least become brittle; when rubbed in mass with a\r\npiece of iron, they phosphoresce with a yellow light; specific gravity,\r\n2.4, hardness, 1.5 to 2. Its ready solubility in acids without\r\neffervescence at once distinguishes it from any mineral that it may\r\nresemble. The specimens of nemalite may be more readily obtained than\r\nthe brucite but fine specimens of both may be obtained after finding a\r\nvein of it, by cutting away the rock, which is not hard to do, as it\r\nis in layers and masses packed together, and which maybe wedged out in\r\nlarge masses at a time with the cold chisel and hammer, perhaps at the\r\nrate of three or four cubic feet an hour for the first hour, and in\r\nrapidly decreasing rate as progress is made toward the unweathered rock\r\nand untouched brucite, etc.\r\n\r\n_Serpentine_.--Fair specimens of this may be obtained of a dark oil\r\ngreen color, but not translucent or peculiarly perfect forms. The\r\nvariety known as marmolite, which splits into thin leaves, is plentiful\r\nand often well worth removing.\r\n\r\n_Chromic Iron_.--Crystals of this are included in the denser rock\r\nin great abundance; they are very small, seldom over a few lines\r\nin diameter, of an iron black color, of a regular octahedral form;\r\nsometimes large crystals may be found in place or in the disintegrated\r\nloose rock. I have seen them a half inch in diameter, and a half dozen\r\nin a small mass, thus forming an excellent cabinet specimen. By finding\r\nout by observation where they are the thickest in the rock, and cutting\r\nin at this point, more or less fine crystals may be obtained. This is\r\nreadily found where they are so very abundant, near the equidistant\r\npoints of the walk, that no difficulty should be encountered in so\r\ndoing. These characteristics are interesting, and if large specimens\r\ncannot be obtained, any quantity of the small crystals may be split out,\r\nand, as a group, used for a representative at least. Before the blowpipe\r\nit is infusible, but if powdered, it slowly dissolves in the molten\r\nborax bead and yields a beautiful green globule. The specific gravity,\r\nwhich is generally unattainable, is about 4.5, and hardness 5 to 6. Its\r\npowder or small fragments are attracted by the magnet. A few small veins\r\nof this mineral are also to be found horizontally in the rock, and\r\nsmall masses may be obtained. They are very rare, however. I have seen\r\nnumerous agates from this locality, but have not found them there\r\nmyself. They may be looked for in the loose earth over the outcrop, or\r\nalong the wall of the river. Our next locality is Paterson, N. J., or\r\nrather in a trip first to West Paterson by the D.L. & W. Railroad,\r\nBoonton branch, then back to Paterson proper, which is but a short\r\ndistance, and then home by the Erie road, or, if an excursion ticket has\r\nbeen bought, on the D.L. & W, back from West Paterson. Garret Rock holds\r\nthe minerals of Paterson, and although they are few in number, are very\r\nunique. The first is phrenite. This beautiful mineral occurs in\r\ngeodes, or veins of them, near the surface of the basalt, which is the\r\ncharacteristic formation here, and lies on the red sandstone.\r\n\r\nThese veins are but two or three feet from the surface, and the ones\r\nfrom which the fine specimens are to be and have been obtained are\r\nexposed by the railroad cutting about a thousand feet north of the\r\nstation at West Paterson, and on the west side of the rails. Near or\r\nbelow the beds is a small pile of debris, prominent by being the only\r\none in the vicinity near the rails. In this loose rock and the veins\r\nwhich are by this description readily found and identified, they are\r\nabout three inches in thickness, and in some places widen out into\r\npockets even a foot in diameter They look like seams of a dark earth,\r\nwith blotches of white or green matter where they are weathered, but are\r\nfresher in appearance inside. The rock, in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nveins, is soft, and may be readily broken out with the hammer of, if\r\npossible, a pick bar, and thus some of these geode cavities broken into,\r\nand much finer specimens obtained than in the vein proper. Considerable\r\noccurs scattered about in the before-mentioned pile of loose rock and\r\ndebris, and if one does not prize it sufficiently to cut into the rock,\r\ntaking the chances of lucky find, plenty may be obtained thus; but as\r\nit has been pretty thoroughly picked over where loose, it is much more\r\nsatisfactory to obtain the fine specimens in place in the rock. When\r\nthe bed for the railroad was being cut here, many fine specimens were\r\nobtained by those in the vicinity, and the natives of the place have it\r\nin abundance, and it may be obtained from many of them for a trifle, if\r\none is not inclined to work it out. The mineral itself occurs in masses\r\nin the vein of a white, greenish white, or more or less dark green\r\ncolor. Sometimes yellowish crystals of it occur plentifully in short\r\nthick prisms, but the common form is that of round coralloid bunches,\r\nhaving a radiated structure within. Sometimes it is in masses made up\r\nof a structure resembling the leaves of a book slightly opened, and in\r\nnearly every shape and size. Crystals of the various forms may be well\r\nsecured, and also the different colors from the deep green to the blue\r\nwhite, always remembering that true, perfect crystals are of more value\r\nthan masses or attempted forms. The specific gravity is 2.8 to\r\n2.9, hardness nearly 7 before the blowpipe; it readily fuses after\r\nintumescing; it dissolves in hot acid without gelatinizing, leaving a\r\nflaky residue.\r\n\r\n_Datholite_.--This mineral is very abundant as inferior specimens, and\r\nfrequently very fine ones may be obtained. They occur all around Garret\r\nRock at the juncture of the basalt and red sandstone, in pockets, and as\r\nheavy druses. They are most abundant near the rock cuttings between West\r\nPaterson and Paterson, and may be cut out by patient labor. This is a\r\nlong known and somewhat noted locality for datholite, and no difficulty\r\nneed be experienced in obtaining plenty of fair specimens. Near them is\r\nthe red sandstone, lying under the basalt, and baked to a scoriaceous\r\ncinder. Upon this is a layer of datholite in the form of a crystalline\r\nplate, and over or above this, either in the basalt or hanging down into\r\ncavities in the sandstone, are the crystals or geodes of datholite. Old\r\nspots are generally exhausted, and consequently every new comer has to\r\nhunt up new pockets, but as this is readily done, I will not expend\r\nfurther comment on the matter. The datholite, as in other localities,\r\nconsists of groups of small colorless crystals. Hardness, about 5;\r\nspecific gravity, 3. Before the blowpipe it intumesces and melts to a\r\nglassy globule coloring the flame green, and forms a jelly when boiled\r\nwith the acids.\r\n\r\n_Pectolite_--This mineral is also quite abundant in places, the greater\r\npart occurring with or near the phrenite before mentioned, in small\r\nmasses generally more or less weathered, but in very fair specimens,\r\nwhich are about an inch in thickness. It is readily recognized by its\r\npeculiar appearance, which, I may again repeat, is in fibrous masses,\r\nthese fibers being set together in radiated forms, and are quite tough\r\nand flexible, of a white color, and readily fused to a globule before\r\nthe blowpipe.\r\n\r\n_Feldspar_.--This mineral occurs strewn over the hill from place to\r\nplace, and is peculiarly characterized by its lively flesh red color,\r\nquite different from the dull yellowish gray of that from Staten Island\r\nor Bergen Hill. Fine crystals of it are rather rare, but beautiful\r\nspecimens of broken groups may be obtained in loose debris around the\r\nhill and in its center. I have not been able to locate the vein or veins\r\nfrom which it has come, but persistent search will probably reveal it,\r\nor it may be stumbled upon by accident. Some of the residents of the\r\nvicinity have some fine specimens, and it is possible that they can\r\ndirect to a plentiful locality. However, some specimens are well worth\r\na thorough search, and possess considerable value as mineralogieal\r\nspecimens. The specific gravity of the mineral is 2.6, and it has a\r\nhardness of 6 before the blowpipe. It is with difficulty fused to a\r\nglobule, more or less transparent. It occurs undoubtedly in veins in the\r\nbasalt and near the surface of the outcrop As this locality has never\r\nbefore been mentioned as affording this species, it is fresh to the\r\namateur and other mineralogists, and there need be no difficulty in\r\nobtaining some fine specimens. Its brilliant color distinguishes it from\r\nother minerals of the locality.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some of the other zeolites as mentioned under Bergen\r\nHill occur here, but I have not been able to find them. The reason\r\nmay be that the rock is but little cut into, and consequently no new\r\nunaltered veins are exposed.\r\n\r\nCOPPER MINES, ARLINGTON, N. J.--A short distance north of this station,\r\non the New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad, and about nine miles from\r\nJersey City, is one of the cuttings into the deposits of copper which\r\npermeate many portions of the red sandstone of this and the allied\r\ndistricts in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and which have been so\r\nextensively worked further south at Somerville and New Brunswick, etc.\r\nThere are quite a variety of copper minerals occurring in these mines,\r\nand as they differ but little in anything but abundance, I will describe\r\nthis, the one nearest to New York City, as I promised in commencing\r\nthese papers. The locality of this mine may be readily found, as it is\r\nnear the old turnpike from Jersey City, along which the water-pipes or\r\naqueduct, are laid. By taking the road directly opposite to the station\r\nat Arlington, walking north to its end, which is a short distance, then\r\nturning to the left along the road, there crossing and turning north up\r\nthe next road joining this, until the turnpike is reached; this is then\r\nfollowed east for about a quarter-mile, passing occasional heaps in the\r\nroad of green earth, until the head of a descent is reached, when we\r\nturn off into the field to the left, and there find the mine near the\r\nheaps of greenish rocks and ore scattered about, a distance from the\r\nstation of about a mile and a half through a pleasing country. The\r\nentrance to the mine is to the right of the bank of white earth on the\r\nedge of, and in the east side of the hill; it is a tunnel more or less\r\ncaved in, running in under the heaps of rock for some distance. It will\r\nnot be necessary, even if it were safe, to venture into the mine, but\r\nall the specimens mentioned below may be obtained from the heaps of ore\r\nand rock outside, and in the outcrops in the east side of the hill, a\r\nlittle north of the mouth of the tunnel to the mine. The hammer and cold\r\nchisel will be necessary, and about three hours should be allowed to\r\nstay, taking the noon train from New York there, and the 5.09 P.M. train\r\nin return, or the 6.30 A.M. train from the city, and the 1.57 P.M. in\r\nreturn. This will give ample opportunity for the selection of specimens,\r\nand, if time is left, to visit the water works, etc.\r\n\r\n_Green Malachite_.--This is the prominent mineral of the locality, and\r\nis conspicuous by its rich green color on all the rocks and in the\r\noutcrops. Fine specimens of it form excellent cabinet specimens. It\r\nshould be in masses of good size, with a silky, divergent, fibrous\r\nstructure, quite hard, and of a pure oil green color, for this purpose.\r\nDrused crystals of it are also very beautiful and abundant, but very\r\nminute. As the greater part of it is but a sixteenth or eighth of an\r\ninch in thickness, it may require some searching to secure large masses\r\na quarter to a half-inch in thickness, but there was considerable, both\r\nin the rock, debris, and outcrop, remaining the last visit I made to the\r\nplace a few months ago. The mineral is so characterized by its color and\r\nsolubility in acid that a detailed description of it is unnecessary to\r\nserve to distinguish it. Its specific gravity is 4, and hardness about\r\n4. It decrepitates before the blowpipe, but when fused with some borax\r\nin a small hollow on a piece of wood charcoal, gives a globule of\r\ncopper. It readily dissolves in acids, with effervescence, as it is a\r\ncarbonate of copper.\r\n\r\n_Red Oxide of Copper_--This rather rare mineral is found in small\r\nquantities in this mine, or near it, in the debris or outcrop. Perfect\r\ncrystals, which are of a dodecahedral or octahedral form, are fairly\r\nabundant. They are difficult to distinguish, as they are generally\r\ncoated, or soiled at least, with malachite. The color proper is of\r\na brownish red, and the hardness about 4, although sometimes, it is\r\nearthy, with an apparent hardness not over 2. The crystals are generally\r\nabout a quarter of an inch to a half of an inch in diameter, and found\r\ninside the masses of malachite. When these are broken open, the red\r\ncopper oxide is readily distinguished, and may be separated or brought\r\ninto relief by carefully trimming away the malachite surrounding it as\r\nits gravity (6) is much greater than malachite. When a piece of the last\r\nis found which has a high gravity, it may be suspected and broken into,\r\nas this species is much more valuable and rarer than the malachite\r\nwhich is so abundant. It dissolves in acids like malachite, but without\r\neffervescence, if it be freed from that mineral, and acts the same\r\nbefore the blowpipe. Sometimes it may be found as an earthy substance,\r\nbut is difficult to distinguish from the red sandstone accompanyit,\r\nwhich both varieties resemble, but which, not being soluble in the\r\nacids, find having the blowpipe reactions, is thus characterized. This\r\nred oxide of copper does not form a particularly showy cabinet specimen,\r\nbut its rarity and value fully compensate for a search after it. I have\r\nfound considerable of it here, and seen some little of it in place\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\n_Chrysorolla_.--This mineral, very abundant in this locality, resembles\r\nmalachite, but has a much bluer, lighter color, without the fibrous\r\nstructure so often present in malachite, and seldom in masses, it only\r\noccurring as light druses and incrustations, some of which are very\r\nbeautiful, and make very fine cabinet specimens. Its hardness is less\r\nthan that of the other species, being under 3, and a specific gravity\r\nof only 2, but as it frequently occurs mixed with them, is difficult to\r\ndistinguish. It does not dissolve in nitric acid, although that takes\r\nthe characteristic green color of a solution of nitrate of copper,\r\nas from malachite or red oxide. This species is found all over this\r\nlocality, and a fine drused mass of it will form an excellent memento of\r\nthe trip.\r\n\r\n_Copper Glance_.--This mineral is quite abundant in places here, but\r\nfine crystals, even small, as it all is, are rare. That which I have\r\nseen has been embedded in the loose rock above the mine, about a quarter\r\ninch in diameter, and more or less disguised by a green coating of\r\nchrysocolla. The color of the mineral itself is a glistening grayish\r\nlead color, resembling chromite somewhat in appearance, but the crystals\r\nof an entirely different shape, being highly modified or indistinct\r\nrhombic prisms. The specific gravity is over 5, and the hardness 4.\r\nBefore the blowpipe on a piece of wood charcoal it gives off fumes of\r\nsulphur, fuses, boils, and finally leaves a globule of copper. In nitric\r\nacid it dissolves, but the sulphur in combination with it separates as\r\na white powder. A steel knife blade placed in this solution receives a\r\ncoating of copper known by its red color.\r\n\r\n_Erubescite_--This mineral occurs massive in the rock here with the\r\nother copper minerals, and is of a yellowish red color, more or less\r\ntarnished to a light brown on its surface, Before the blowpipe on\r\ncharcoal it fuses, burns, and affords a globule of copper and iron,\r\nwhich is attracted by the magnet. Its specific gravity is 5, hardness\r\n3. It resembles somewhat the red oxide, but the low gravity, inferior\r\nhardness, lighter color, and blowpipe reaction distinguish it. These\r\nare the only copper minerals likely to be found at this mine, and the\r\nfollowing table and note will show their characteristics:\r\n\r\nName.

Claypole's paper on the above insect, accepting the determination\r\nof the species as _Sericoris instrutana_, and mentioning the fact that\r\nthe work of _Proteoteras æsculana_ Riley upon maple and buckeye was very\r\nsimilar. A letter recently received from Mr. Claypole, prior to sending\r\nhis article to press, and some specimens which be had kindly submitted\r\nto us, permit of some corrections and definite statements. We have a\r\nsingle specimen in our collection, bred from a larva found feeding, in\r\n1873, on the blossoms of buckeye, and identical with Mr. Claypole's\r\nspecimens, which are in too poor condition for description or positive\r\ndetermination. With this material and with Mr Claypole's observations\r\nand our own notes, the following facts are established:\r\n\r\n1st. We have _Proteoteras æsculana_ boring in the terminal green twigs\r\nof both maple and buckeye, in Missouri, and often producing a swelling\r\nor pseudo-gall. Exceptionally it works in the leaf-stalk. It also feeds\r\non the samara of maple, as we reared the moth in June, 1881, from\r\nlarvæ infesting these winged seeds that had been collected by Mr. A.J.\r\nWethersby, of Cincinnati, O.\r\n\r\n2d. We have an allied species, boring in the leaf-stalk of buckeye,\r\nin Ohio, as observed by Mr. Claypole. It bears some resemblance\r\nto _Proteoteras æsculana_, but differs from it in the following\r\nparticulars, so far as can be ascertained from the poor material\r\nexamined: The primaries are shorter and more acuminate at apex.\r\nTheir general color is paler, with the dark markings less distinctly\r\nseparated. No distinct tufts of scales or knobs appear, and the\r\nocellated region is traversed by four or five dark longitudinal lines.\r\nIt would be difficult to distinguish it from a rubbed and faded specimen\r\nof _æsculana_, were it not for the form of the wing, on which, however,\r\none dare not count too confidently. It probably belongs to the same\r\ngenus, and we would propose for it the name of _claypoleana_. The\r\nlarva is distinguished from that of _æsculana_ by having the minute\r\ngranulations of the skin smooth, whereas in the latter each granule has\r\na minute sharp point.\r\n\r\n3d. _Sericoris instrutana_ is a totally different insect. Hence our\r\nprevious remarks as to the diversity of food-habit in this species have\r\nno force--_C.V.R._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDEFOLIATION OF OAK TREES BY DRYOCAMPA SENATORIA IN PERRY COUNTY,\r\nPA.--During the present autumn the woods and road-sides in this\r\nneighborhood (New Bloomfield) present a singular appearance in\r\nconsequence of the ravages of the black and yellow larva of the above\r\nspecies. It is more abundant, so I am informed, than it has ever been\r\nbefore. In some places hardly any trees of the two species to which its\r\nattack is here limited have escaped. These are the black or yellow oak\r\n(_Q. tinctoria_) with its variety (_coccinea_), the scarlet oak and, the\r\nscrub oak (_Q. ilicifolia_). These trees appear brown on the hill-sides\r\nfrom a distance, in consequence of being altogether stripped of\r\ntheir leaves. The sound of the falling frass from the thousands of\r\ncaterpillars resembles a shower of rain. They crawl in thousands over\r\nthe ground, ten or twelve being sometimes seen on a square yard. The\r\nsprings and pools are crowded with drowned specimens. They are equally\r\nabundant in all parts of the county which I have visited during the\r\npast week or two--the central and southeastern.--_E. W. Olaypole, New\r\nBloomfield, Pa_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEFFICACY OF CHALCID EGG-PARASITES.--Egg-parasites are among the most\r\nefficient destroyers of insects injurious to vegetation, since they kill\r\ntheir victim before it has begun to do any damage; but few persons are\r\naware of the vast numbers in which these tiny parasites occasionally\r\nappear. Owing to the abundance of one of them (_Trichogramma pretiosa_\r\nRiley), we have known the last brood of the cotton-worm to be\r\nannihilated, and Mr. H.G. Hubbard reported the same experience at\r\nCenterville, Fla. Miss Mary E. Murtfeldt has recently communicated to us\r\na similar experience with a species of the Proctotrupid genus Telenomus,\r\ninfesting the eggs of the notorious squash-bug (_Coreus tristis_). She\r\nwrites: \"The eggs of the Coreus have been very abundant on our squash\r\nand melon vines, but fully ninety per cent. of them thus far [August 2]\r\nhave been parasitized--the only thing that has saved the plants from\r\nutter destruction.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON THE BIOLOGY OF GONATOPUS PILOSUS Thoms--Professor Josef Mik, in the\r\nSeptember number of the _Wiener Entomologische Zeitung_ (pp. 215-221,\r\npl. iii), gives a most interesting account of the life history of the\r\ncurious Proctotrupid, _Gonatopus pilosus_ Thoms., which has not before\r\nbeen thoroughly understood. Ferris, in his \"Nouvelles excursions dans\r\nles grandes Landes,\" tells how, from cocoons of parasitic larvae on\r\n_Athysanus maritima_ (a Cicadellid) he bred _Gonatopus pedestris_, but\r\nthis he considered a secondary parasite, from the fact that it issued\r\nfrom an inner cocoon. It appears from the observations of Mik, however,\r\nthat it was in all probability a primary parasite, as with the species\r\nstudied by the latter (_G. pilosus_) the larva spins both an outer\r\nand an inner cocoon. The larva of _Gonatopus pilosus_ is an external\r\nparasite upon the Cicadellid _Deltocephalus xanthoneurus_ Fieb. The eggs\r\nare laid in June or July, and the larvae, attaching themselves at the\r\njunction of two abdominal segments, feed upon the juices of their host.\r\nBut one parasite is found upon a single Cicadellid, and it occasionally\r\nshifts its position from one part of the abdomen to another. Leaving its\r\nhost in September, it spins a delicate double cocoon in which it remains\r\nall winter in the larva state, transforming to pupa in May, and issuing\r\nas an imago in June.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the female in the genus Gonatopus is\r\nfurnished with a very remarkable modification of the claws of the front\r\ntarsi, which are very strongly developed, and differ somewhat in shape\r\nin the different species. It has usually been supposed that these claws\r\nwere for the purpose of grasping prey, but Professor Mik offers the more\r\nsatisfactory explanation that they are for the purpose of grasping the\r\nCicadellids, and holding them during the act of oviposition.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that there is in the collection of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture a specimen of _Amphiscepa bivittata_ Say,\r\nwhich bears, in the position described above, a parasitic larva similar\r\nto that described by Mik. It left its victim and spun a white cocoon,\r\nbut we failed to rear the imago. It is probably the larva of a\r\nGonatopus, and possibly that of the only described American species of\r\nthe genus, _Gonatopus contortulus_ Patton (_Can. Ent._, xi p. 64).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF OTIORHYNCHIDAE INJURIOUS TO CULTIVATED PLANTS--Of our\r\nnumerous species of this family, we know the development and earlier\r\nstages of only one species, viz, Fuller's rosebeetle (_Aramigus\r\nFulleri_[1]). A few other species have attracted attention by the injury\r\ncaused by them as perfect insects. They are as follows: _Epicoerus\r\nimbricatus_, a very general feeder; _Pachnoeus opalus_ and _Artipus\r\nfloridanus_, both injurious to the orange tree. Of a few other species\r\nwe know the food-plants: thus _Neoptochus adspersus_ feeds on oak;\r\n_Pachnoeus distans_ on oak and pine; _Brachystylus acutus_ is only\r\nfound on persimmon; _Aphrastus toeniatus_ lives on pawpaw (but not\r\nexclusively); _Eudiagogus pulcher_ and _rosenschoeldi_ defoliate the\r\ncoffee-weeds (_Cassia occidentalis_ and other species of the same\r\ngenus). Two very common species, _Pandeleteius hilaris_ and _Tanymecus\r\nconfertus_, appear to be polyphagous, without preference for any\r\nparticular plant. Very recently the habits of another species, _Anametis\r\ngrisea_ Horn, were brought to our knowledge by Mr. George P. Peffer, of\r\nPewaukee, Wis., who sent us specimens of the beetle accompanied by the\r\nfollowing communication: \"The larger curculio I send you is working\r\naround the roots of apple and pear trees, near the surface of the ground\r\nor around the union where grafts are set. I found fifteen of the larvae\r\non a small tree one and a half inches in diameter. The beetle seems to\r\nlay its eggs just where the bark commences to be soft, near or partly\r\nunder the ground. The larvae eat the bark only, but they are so numerous\r\nas to girdle the tree entirely in a short time.\"--_C. V. Riley_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vide Annual Report Department of Agriculture, 1878, p.\r\n257.]\r\n\r\nBOMBYLIID LARVAE DESTROYING LOCUST EGGS IN ASIA MINOR.--The eggs of\r\nlocusts in Cyprus and the Dardanelles, as we learn from the Proceedings\r\nof the London Entomological Society, are much infested with the\r\nparasitic larvae of _Bombyltidae_, though these were previously not\r\nknown to occur on the island. This fact shows that the habit which we\r\ndiscovered among some of our N. A. _Bombyliids_ recurs in other parts\r\nof the world, and we have little doubt that careful search among locust\r\neggs will also reveal the larval habits of some of the _Meloïdae_ in\r\nEurope and elsewhere. Indeed, notwithstanding the closest experiments\r\nof Jules Lichtenstein, which show that the larva of the Spanish\r\nblister-beetle of commerce will feed on honey, we imagine that its more\r\nnatural food will be found in future to be locust eggs. The particular\r\n_Bombyliid_ observed by Mr. Frank Calvert destroying locusts in the\r\nDardanelles is _Callostoma fascipennis_ Macq., and its larva and pupa\r\nvery closely resemble those of _Triodites mus_. which we have studied\r\nand figured (see Vol. XV., pl. vi.). We quote some of Mr. Calvert's\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\n\"On the 24th of April I examined the larvae in the ground; the only\r\nchange was a semi-transparent appearance which allowed of a movable\r\nblack spot to be seen in the body. On the 8th June about fifty per cent.\r\nof the larvae had cast a skin and assumed the pupal state in their\r\nlittle cells: the color yellowish-brown, darkening to gray in the more\r\nadvanced insect. About one per cent. of the cells, in which were two\r\nskins and an aperture to the surface, showed the perfect insect to have\r\nalready come out of them. A gray pupa I was holding in my hand suddenly\r\nburst its envelope, and in halt a minute on its legs stood a fly, thus\r\nidentifying the perfect insect.... I found the fly, now identified,\r\nsucking the nectar of flowers, especially of the pink scabious and\r\nthistle, plants common in the Troad. (Later on I counted as many as\r\nsixteen flies on a thistle-head.) The number of flies rapidly increased\r\ndaily until the 13th, when the ground appeared pitted all over with\r\nsmall holes from whence the parasite had issued. A few pupae were then\r\nstill to be found--a larva the rare exception. The pupal state thus\r\nseems to be of short duration. It was very interesting to watch the\r\nflies appearing above ground; first the head was pushed out; then, with\r\nrepeated efforts, the body followed; the whole operation was over in\r\ntwo or three minutes; the wings were expanded, but the colors did not\r\nbrighten until some time after. Occasionally a pupa could not cast\r\noff its envelope, and came wriggling out of the ground, when it was\r\nimmediately captured by ants. Unfortunate flies that could not detach\r\nthe covering membrane adhering to the abdomen, also fell a prey, as\r\nindeed many of the flies that could not get on their legs in time. The\r\nflies for the first time 13th June, were seen to pair, but this rarely.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPARROWS IN THE UNITED STATES.--EFFECT OF ACCLIMATION, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house sparrows were first brought to New York city in 1862. They\r\nmight have been introduced in consideration of the scientific usefulness\r\nof the experiment; but the importation was made solely in view of the\r\nbenefit to result from their immense consumption of larvae.\r\n\r\nI have long observed peculiarities in their acclimation which are hardly\r\nknown at all, and which must have a scientific importance. The subject\r\nmight also be worthy of general interest, so numerous and familiar have\r\nthe sparrows become all over our country.\r\n\r\nWalking on Fifth avenue, or in the parks of the city, during the\r\nbreeding season, one's attention is repeatedly attracted by the pitiful\r\nshrill call of a sparrow fallen on the pavement upon its first attempt\r\nat flight, or by the stronger note of a mother sparrow, sharply\r\nbewailing the fate of a little one, killed by the fall, or dispatched\r\nalive by the cat.\r\n\r\nShould we take and examine these little weaklings, we should find\r\ngenerally that they are at a period when they normally should have the\r\nstrength for flight, and we should also find that they are almost always\r\nof a lightish tint, some with head white, others with streaks and spots\r\nof white on the tail or back, and occasionally one is found entirely\r\nwhite, with red eyes--a complete albino. It is an accepted fact that the\r\ncity-sparrow is everywhere of a lighter color than that of the country.\r\nBut here the greater lightness exists in so many cases, to such\r\na degree, and particularly in female sparrows, that it should be\r\ndiscussed, at least in part, under the head of albinism.\r\n\r\nThat so many which lack the muscular strength in their wings should be\r\nso generally affected with albinism, is a significant fact to those\r\ninterested in this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nMany hold, with Darwin, that this extraordinary want of coloring matter,\r\noccasionally met with in all animals, is not to be regarded as an index\r\ndenoting an unhealthful condition of the animal. That it is so often\r\nunited in the young sparrow with physical inability, argues favorably\r\nfor those who bold a different view.\r\n\r\nIn my observations, what has struck me as a most curious fact, and what\r\nI have found to be generally ignored, is that this wide-spread albinism\r\nand general weakness of our acclimated house-sparrow are not found among\r\nits progenitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout several sojourns that I made in Europe. I searched for a\r\ntoken of the remarkable characteristics existing here, but I never\r\nsucceeded in finding one in England, France, or in Germany, nor have I\r\nmet an observer that has.\r\n\r\nThis albinism and weakness, existing simultaneously to such an extent in\r\nour young house-sparrows, are evidently the result of their acclimation.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that our now _numerous_ sparrows, being descended from\r\na _few_ European birds, and that, probably, continual and close\r\nreproduction among individuals of the same stock, as in the case of our\r\noriginal _few_ sparrows, has encouraged weakness in the race, can hardly\r\nserve as an explanation of this phenomenon, because the sparrow is so\r\nprolific that, after a few years, so many families had been formed that\r\nthe relation between them became very distant.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the greater proportion of albinism found in the young is\r\nobvious; the young sparrows affected with albinism, lacking usually the\r\nphysical strength to battle their way in life, meet death prematurely,\r\nand thus a very small proportion of the number is permitted to reach\r\nmaturity, while those that do owe it to some favoring circumstance. Many\r\nare picked up and cared for by the public; and among those to whom these\r\nsparrows generally owe such prolongation of life are the policemen in\r\nour public parks, who often bring these little waifs to their homes,\r\nkeeping some, and sending others out into the world, after caring for\r\nthem until they have acquired the sufficient strength. However, almost\r\nall of these albino-sparrows are picked up by the cat, and immediately\r\ndisposed of to the feline's physical benefit. They form such a prominent\r\ndiet among the cats near Washington Park, where I live, that, upon the\r\nremoval of some of our neighbors to the upper part of the city, it was\r\nnoticed that their cat became dissatisfied and lean, as sparrow-meat is\r\nnot to be found so extensively there, but it finally became resigned,\r\nfinding it possible to procure about three sparrows daily.\r\n\r\nAnd here attention should be called to the method employed by our cats\r\nto catch not only the weak, but fine, healthy sparrows as well; it ought\r\nperhaps to be looked upon as a mark of intellectual improvement, for\r\noriginally their attempts consisted chiefly in a very unsuccessful\r\ngiving chase to the flying bird, whereas the cats of to-day are skilled\r\nin a hundred adroit devices. It has often been a source of enjoyment to\r\nwatch their well-laid schemes and delicate maneuverings.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder then, with such dainty fare at his disposal, that the cat is\r\noften found to have become indifferent to rats, and even to mice?\r\n\r\nThere are several notable changes, no more desirable than the foregoing,\r\nwhich have been caused by the introduction of the house-sparrow. The\r\nonly positive benefit which occurs to me is that the measuring worm,\r\nwhich formerly infested all our vegetation, is now very nearly extinct\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the sparrows. A pair of these, during the\r\nbreeding-season, destroys four thousand larvae weekly.\r\n\r\nIn some places, complaints are made that their untidy nests mar the\r\nappearance of trees and walls.\r\n\r\nThe amount of havoc in our wheatfields created yearly by them is\r\nenormous. Their forwardness and activity have driven all other birds\r\nfrom where they have settled, so that the hairy caterpillars, which\r\nsparrows do not eat and which used to be extensively consumed by other\r\nbirds, are now greatly on the increase, probably the only creatures, at\r\npresent, enjoying the domestication of the sparrow in this country....\r\nI have also to remark that the sparrows here betray much less pugnacity\r\nthan in Europe.--E.M., M.D.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the _Chemical Review_ that recent analyses of the water\r\nfrom the _Holy Well_ at Mecca, which is so eagerly drunk by pilgrims,\r\nshow this water to be sewage, about ten times stronger than average\r\nLondon sewage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn looking over the excellent article of Professor S.

Haupt, in the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No. 360, on the subject of finding the\r\nmeridian, I discovered that one important step is not given, which,\r\nmight prove an embarrassment to a new beginner.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth paragraph, in the third column of page 5,748, he says:\r\n\"Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction, ... and the\r\nresult will be the latitude.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this result is only the true altitude of the\r\nstar. The _latitude_ is found by further increasing or diminishing this\r\naltitude by the polar distance of the star.\r\n\r\nThis paper will be of great value to engineers and surveyors, for the\r\nelementary works on surveying have not treated the subject clearly.\r\n\r\nH.
