Bellows,\r\n\r\n        THIS BOOK\r\n\r\n        IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this volume, the author has had in his mind the\r\nintention to delineate the progress of a boy whose education had been\r\nneglected, and whose moral attributes were of the lowest order, from\r\nvice and indifference to the development of a high moral and religious\r\nprinciple in the heart, which is the rule and guide of a pure and true\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe incidents which make up the story are introduced to illustrate the\r\nmoral status of the youth, at the beginning, and to develop the\r\ninfluences from which proceeded a gentle and Christian character.\r\nMollie, the captain's daughter, whose simple purity of life, whose\r\nfilial devotion to an erring parent, and whose trusting faith in the\r\nhour of adversity, won the love and respect of Noddy, was not the least\r\nof these influences. If the writer has not \"moralized,\" it was because\r\nthe true life, seen with the living eye, is better than any precept,\r\nhowever skilfully it may be dressed by the rhetorical genius of the\r\nmoralist.\r\n\r\nOnce more the author takes pleasure in acknowledging the kindness of his\r\nyoung friends, who have so favorably received his former works; and he\r\nhopes that \"WORK AND WIN,\" the fourth of the Woodville Stories, will\r\nhave as pleasant a welcome as its predecessors.\r\n\r\n                                              WILLIAM T.

I\r\nfound it, and she say you must wash out the boat-house every morning\r\nbefore nine o'clock. If you don't do it, I shall report you to her.\r\nThat's all I've got to say about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I calculate to wash out the boat-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've only half an hour to do it in, then. You've not only got to wash\r\nit out every morning, but you have got to do it before nine o'clock.\r\nThem's the orders. I always obey orders. If Miss Bertha should tell me\r\nto tie you up, and give you as big a licking as you deserve, I should do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't got any such orders, mind ye, Noddy; so we won't dispute\r\nabout that. Now, go and wash out the boat-house like a good boy, and\r\ndon't make any fuss about it.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy deliberated a few moments more. He evidently disliked the job, or\r\ndid not wish to do it at that particular time; but Miss Bertha's\r\ninfluence was all-powerful; and though he would have fought, tooth and\r\nnail, against anything like compulsion on the part of Ben, he could not\r\nresist the potent spell which the name of his young mistress cast upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Hang the old boat-house!\" exclaimed he, as he stamped his foot upon the\r\nground, and then slowly retraced his steps towards the boatman.\r\n\r\n\"Hang it, if you like, Noddy, but wash it out first,\" said Ben, with a\r\nsmile, as he observed the effect of the charm he had used to induce the\r\nwayward youth to do his duty.\r\n\r\n\"I wish the boat-house was burned up!\" added Noddy, petulantly.\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do. I wish it was a pile of ashes at this moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say so, Noddy. What would Miss Bertha think to hear you talk like\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can tell her, if you like,\" replied Noddy, as he rushed desperately\r\ninto the boat-house to do the disagreeable job.\r\n\r\nNoddy Newman was an orphan; and no one in the vicinity of Woodville even\r\nknew what his real name was. Two years before, Bertha Grant had taken\r\nthe most tender care of him, after an accident by which he had been\r\nseverely injured. Previous to that time he had been a vagabond, roaming\r\nabout the woods and the villages, sleeping in barns and out-buildings,\r\nand stealing his food when he could obtain it by no other means. Efforts\r\nhad been made to commit him to the poorhouse; but he had cunningly\r\navoided being captured, and retained his freedom until the accident\r\nplaced him under the influence of Bertha Grant, who had before vainly\r\nattempted to induce him to join her mission-school in the Glen.\r\n\r\nNoddy had been two years at Woodville. He was neither a servant nor a\r\nmember of the family, but occupied a half-way position, eating and\r\nsleeping with the men employed on the estate, but being the constant\r\ncompanion of Bertha, who was laboring to civilize and educate him. She\r\nhad been partially successful in her philanthropic labors; for Noddy\r\nknew how to behave himself with propriety, and could read and write with\r\ntolerable facility. But books and literature were not Noddy's _forte_,\r\nand he still retained an unhealthy relish for his early vagabond habits.\r\n\r\nLike a great many other boys,--even like some of those who have been\r\nbrought up judiciously and carefully,--Noddy was not very fond of work.\r\nHe was bold and impulsive, and had not yet acquired any fixed ideas in\r\nregard to the objects of life. Bertha Grant had obtained a powerful\r\ninfluence over him, to which he was solely indebted for all the progress\r\nhe had made in learning and the arts of civilized life. Wayward as he\r\nalways had been, and as he still was, there was a spirit in him upon\r\nwhich to build a hope that something might yet be made of him, though\r\nthis faith was in a great measure confined to Bertha and the old\r\nboatman.\r\n\r\nHe had a great many good qualities--enough, in the opinion of his gentle\r\ninstructress, to redeem him from his besetting sins, which were neither\r\nfew nor small. He was generous, which made him popular among those who\r\nwere under no moral responsibility for his future welfare. He was bold\r\nand daring, and never hesitated to do anything which the nerve or muscle\r\nof a boy of fourteen could achieve. His feats of strength and daring,\r\noften performed from mere bravado, won the admiration of the\r\nthoughtless, and Noddy was regarded as a \"character\" by people who only\r\nwanted to be amused.\r\n\r\nNoddy had reached an age when the future became an interesting problem\r\nto those who had labored to improve his manners and his morals. Mr.\r\nGrant had suggested to Bertha the propriety of having him bound as an\r\napprentice to some steady mechanic; and, at the time of our story, she\r\nand her father were in search of such a person. The subject of this kind\r\nsolicitude did not relish the idea of learning a trade, though he had\r\nnot positively rebelled at the disposition which it was proposed to make\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nHe had always lived near the river; and during his residence at\r\nWoodville he had been employed, so far as he could be employed at all,\r\nabout the boats. He was a kind of assistant to the boatman, though there\r\nwas no need of such an official on the premises. For his own good,\r\nrather than for the labor he performed, he was required to do certain\r\nwork about the boat-house, and in the boats when they were in use.\r\n\r\nWe could recite a great many scrapes, of which Noddy had been the hero,\r\nduring the two years of his stay at Woodville; but such a recital would\r\nhardly be profitable to our readers, especially as the young man's\r\nsubsequent career was not devoid of stirring incidents.\r\n\r\nNoddy drew a bucket of water at the pier, and carried it into the\r\nboat-house. Ben, satisfied now that the work was actually in progress,\r\nleft the pier, and walked up to the house to receive his morning\r\ninstructions. He was hardly out of sight before Miss Fanny Grant\r\npresented herself at the door.\r\n\r\nMiss Fanny was now a nice young lady of twelve. She was as different\r\nfrom her sister Bertha as she could be. She was proud, and rather\r\nwayward. Like some other young ladies we have somewhere read about, she\r\nwas very fond of having her own way, even when her own way had been\r\nproved to be uncomfortable and dangerous. But when we mention Miss\r\nFanny's faults, we do not wish to be understood that she had no virtues.\r\nIf she did wrong very often, she did right in the main, and had made a\r\ngreat deal of progress in learning to do wisely and well, and, what was\r\njust as good, in doing it after she had learned it.\r\n\r\nFanny Grant walked up to the boat-house with a very decided step, and it\r\nsoon appeared that she was not there by chance or accident; which leads\r\nus sorrowfully to remark, that in her wrongdoing she often found a ready\r\ncompanion and supporter in Noddy Newman. She was rather inclined to be a\r\nromp; and though she was not given to \"playing with the boys,\" the\r\nabsence of any suitable playmate sometimes led her to invite the\r\nhalf-reformed vagabond of Woodville to assist in her sport.\r\n\r\n\"You are a pretty fellow, Noddy Newman!\" said she, her pouting lips\r\ngiving an added emphasis to her reproachful remark. \"Why didn't you come\r\ndown to the Point, as you said you would?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I couldn't, Miss Fanny,\" growled Noddy. \"I had to wash out this\r\nconfounded boat-house, or be reported to Miss Bertha.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you do that after you got back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ben said I must do it before nine o'clock. I wanted to go down to the\r\nPoint, as I agreed, but you see I couldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I waited for you till I got tired out,\" pouted Fanny; but she neglected\r\nto add that five minutes on ordinary occasions were the full limit of\r\nher patience.\r\n\r\n\"Hang the old boat-house! I told Ben I wished it was burned up.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I; but come along, Noddy. We will go now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't go till I've washed out the boat-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if Ben comes down and finds the place hasn't been washed out, he\r\nwill tell Miss Bertha.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him tell her--who cares?\"\r\n\r\n\"She will talk to me for an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let her talk--talking won't kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to be talked to in that way by Miss Bertha.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fiddle-de-dee! You can tell her I wanted you,\" said Fanny, her eyes\r\nsnapping with earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell her what you wanted me for?\" asked Noddy, with a cunning\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you needn't tell her that. But come along, or I shall go\r\nwithout you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--you wouldn't do that, Miss Fanny. You couldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, won't you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go just as soon as I have done washing the boat-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plague on the boat-house!\" snapped Fanny. \"I wish it was burned up.\r\nWhat a nice fire it would make!--wouldn't it, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\nThe bright eyes of the wayward miss sparkled with delight as she thought\r\nof the blazing building; and while her more wayward companion described\r\nthe miseries which he daily endured in his regular work, she hardly\r\nlistened to him. She seemed to be plotting mischief; but if she was, she\r\ndid not make Noddy her confidant this time.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Noddy,\" said she, after a few moments' reflection, \"I will\r\npromise to make it all right with Bertha.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy dropped the broom with which he had begun to sweep up some chips\r\nand shavings Ben had made in repairing a boat-hook.\r\n\r\n\"If you will get me out of the scrape, I will go now,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I will; you may depend upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Ben, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has gone up to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you run down to the Point, and bring the boat up to the pier. I am\r\ntired, and don't want to walk down there again.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was entirely willing, and bounded off like a deer, for he had\r\nfully made up his mind to disobey orders, and his impulsive nature did\r\nnot permit him to consider the consequences. He was absent but a few\r\nmoments, and presently appeared rowing a small boat up the river. At the\r\npier he turned the boat, and backed her up to the landing steps.\r\n\r\n\"All ready, Miss Fanny!\" shouted the young boatman, for his companion in\r\nmischief was not in sight.\r\n\r\nStill she did not appear; and Noddy was about to go in search of her,\r\nwhen she came out of the boat-house, and ran down to the steps. Her face\r\nwas flushed, and she seemed to be very much agitated. Noddy was afraid,\r\nfrom her looks, that something had happened to spoil the anticipated\r\nsport of the morning; but she stepped into the boat, and told him, in\r\nhurried tones, to push off.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Miss Fanny?\" he asked, not a little startled by her\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, Noddy; pull away just as fast as ever you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we caught?\" said he, as he followed Fanny's direction.\r\n\r\n\"No; caught! no. Why don't you row faster, Noddy? You don't pull worth a\r\ncent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am pulling as hard as I can,\" replied he, unable to keep pace with\r\nher impatience.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't be seen here now for anything!\" exclaimed Fanny, earnestly,\r\nas she glanced back at the boat-house, with a look so uneasy that it\r\nalmost unmanned her resolute companion.\r\n\r\nNoddy pulled with all his might, and the light boat darted over the\r\nwaves with a speed which ought to have satisfied his nervous passenger.\r\nAs they reached the point of Van Alstine's Island, a dense smoke was\r\nseen to rise from the boat-house on the pier; and a few moments later,\r\nthe whole building was wrapped in flames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCUS AT WHITESTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that?\" exclaimed Noddy, as he stopped rowing, and gazed at\r\nthe flames which leaped madly up from the devoted building.\r\n\r\n\"I see it,\" replied Fanny, with even more agitation than was manifested\r\nby her companion.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand it,\" added Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"The boat-house is on fire, and will burn up in a few minutes more. I\r\nthink it is plain enough;\" and Fanny struggled to be calm and\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\n\"We must go back and see to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall do nothing of the kind. Pull away as hard as ever you can, or\r\nwe shall not get to Whitestone in season.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care about going to Whitestone now; I want to know what all\r\nthat means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you see what it means? The boat-house is on fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how did it catch afire? That's what bothers me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't bother yourself about it. My father owns the boat-house,\r\nand it isn't worth much.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that may be; but I want to know how it got afire.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall find out soon enough when we return.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want to know now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't know now; so pull away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have the credit of setting that fire,\" added Noddy, not a\r\nlittle disturbed by the anticipation.\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall. I told Ben I wished the boat-house would catch afire and\r\nburn up. Of course he will lay it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter if he does; Ben isn't everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he is 'most everybody, so far as Miss Bertha is concerned; and\r\nI'd rather tumbled overboard in December than have that fire happen just\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were not there when the fire broke out,\" said Fanny, with a strong\r\neffort to satisfy her boatman.\r\n\r\n\"That's the very reason why they will lay it to me. They will say I set\r\nthe boat-house afire, and then ran away on purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can say you were with me when the fire broke out, and that I know you\r\ndidn't do it,\" replied Fanny.\r\n\r\n\"That will do; but I would give all my old shoes to know how the fire\r\ntook, myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter how it took.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is matter, Miss Fanny. I want to know. There wasn't any fire in\r\nthe building when I left it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps somebody stopped there in a boat, and set it on fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they did; but I know very well they didn't,\" answered Noddy,\r\npositively. \"There hasn't been any boat near the pier since we left it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Ben left his pipe among those shavings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ben never did that. He would cut his head off sooner than do such a\r\nthing. He is as scared of fire as he is of the Flying Dutchman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say anything more about it. Now row over to Whitestone as quick\r\nas you can,\" added Fanny, petulantly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going over to Whitestone, after what has happened. I shouldn't\r\nhave a bit of fun if I went.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Noddy; then you may get out of the scrape as you can,\" said\r\nthe young lady, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"What scrape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they will accuse you of setting the boat-house afire; and you told\r\nBen you wished it was burned down.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't set it afire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I want to find out. That's what worries me; for I\r\ncan't see how it happened, unless it took fire from that bucket of water\r\nI left on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nFanny was too much disturbed by the conduct of her boatman, or by some\r\nother circumstance, to laugh at Noddy's joke; and the brilliant sally\r\nwas permitted to waste itself without an appreciative smile. She sat\r\nlooking at the angry flames as they devoured the building, while her\r\ncompanion vainly attempted to hit upon a satisfactory explanation of the\r\ncause of the fire. Noddy was perplexed; he was absolutely worried, not\r\nso much by the probable consequences to himself of the unfortunate\r\nevent, as by the cravings of his own curiosity. He did not see how it\r\nhappened; and if a potent juggler had performed a wonderful feat in his\r\npresence, he could not have been more exercised in mind to know how it\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nNoddy was neither a logician nor a philosopher; and therefore he was\r\nutterly unable to account for the origin of the fire. In vain he wasted\r\nhis intellectual powers in speculations; in vain he tried to remember\r\nsome exciting cause to which the calamity could be traced. Meanwhile,\r\nMiss Fanny was deliberating quite as diligently over another question;\r\nfor she apparently regarded the destruction of the boat-house as a small\r\naffair, and did not concern herself to know how it had been caused. But\r\nshe was very anxious to reach Whitestone before ten o'clock, and her\r\nrebellious boatman had intimated his intention not to carry out his part\r\nof the agreement.\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking about, Noddy?\" asked she, when both had\r\nmaintained silence for the full space of three minutes, which was a\r\nlonger period than either of them had ever before kept still while\r\nawake.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of that fire,\" replied Noddy, removing his gaze from the\r\nburning building, and fixing it upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to Whitestone, or not?\" continued she, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"No; I don't want to go to Whitestone, while all of them down there are\r\ntalking about me, and saying I set the boat-house afire.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will believe you did it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't, Miss Fanny. You know I didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I was with you; besides, you came out of the boat-house after I\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will row me over to Whitestone, I will say so; and I will tell\r\nthem I know you didn't do it.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy considered the matter for a moment, and, perhaps concluding that\r\nit was safer for him to keep on the right side of Miss Fanny, he\r\nsignified his acceptance of the terms by taking up his oars, and pulling\r\ntowards Whitestone. But he was not satisfied; he was as uneasy as a fish\r\nout of water; and nothing but the tyranny of the wayward young lady in\r\nthe boat would have induced him to flee from the trouble which was\r\nbrewing at Woodville. He had quite lost sight of the purpose which had\r\ninduced him to disobey Bertha's orders.\r\n\r\nOur young adventurers had not left Woodville without an object. There\r\nwas a circus at Whitestone--a travelling company which had advertised to\r\ngive three grand performances on that day. Miss Fanny wanted to go; but,\r\neither because her father was otherwise occupied, or because he did not\r\napprove of circuses, he had declined to go with her. Bertha did not\r\nwant to go, and also had an engagement.\r\n\r\nFanny had set her heart upon going; and she happened to be too wilful,\r\njust at that period, to submit to the disappointment to which her\r\nfather's convenience or his principles doomed her. Bertha had gone to\r\nthe city at an early hour in the morning to spend the day with a friend,\r\nand Fanny decided that she would go to the circus, in spite of all\r\nobstacles, and in the face of her father's implied prohibition. When she\r\nhad proceeded far enough to rebel, in her own heart, against the will of\r\nher father, the rest of the deed was easily accomplished.\r\n\r\nNoddy had never been to a circus; and when Fanny told him what it\r\nwas,--how men rode standing up on their horses; how they turned\r\nsomersets, and played all sorts of antics on the tight rope and the\r\nslack rope; and, above all, what funny things the clowns said and\r\ndid,--he was quite ready to do almost anything to procure so rare a\r\npleasure as witnessing such a performance must afford him. It did not\r\nrequire any persuasion to induce him to assist Fanny in her\r\ndisobedience. The only obstacle which had presented itself was his\r\nmorning work in the boat-house, which Bertha's departure for the city\r\nhad prevented him from doing at an earlier hour.\r\n\r\nTo prevent Ben from suspecting that they were on the water, in case they\r\nshould happen to be missed, he had borrowed a boat and placed it at the\r\nPoint, where they could embark without being seen, if Ben or any of the\r\nservants happened to be near the pier. The boatman, who made it his\r\nbusiness to see that Noddy did his work on time in the morning, did not\r\nneglect his duty on this occasion; and when Noddy started to meet Fanny\r\nat the appointed place, he had been called back, as described in the\r\nfirst chapter.\r\n\r\nAs he pulled towards Whitestone, he watched the flames that rose from\r\nthe boat-house; and he had, for the time, lost all his enthusiasm about\r\nthe circus. He could think only of the doubtful position in which his\r\nimpulsive words to the boatman placed him. Above all things,--and all\r\nhis doubts and fears culminated in this point,--what would Miss Bertha\r\nsay? He did not care what others said, except so far as their words went\r\nto convince his mistress of his guilt. What would she do to him?\r\n\r\nBut, after all had been said and done, he was not guilty. He had not set\r\nthe boat-house on fire, and he did not even know who had done the\r\nmalicious act. Noddy regarded this as a very happy thought; and while\r\nthe reflection had a place in his mind, he pulled the oars with\r\nredoubled vigor. Yet it was in vain for him to rely upon the voice of an\r\napproving conscience for peace in that hour of trouble. If he had not,\r\nat that moment, been engaged in an act of disobedience, he might have\r\nbeen easy. He had been strictly forbidden by Mr. Grant, and by Bertha,\r\never to take Fanny out in a boat without permission; and Miss Fanny had\r\nbeen as strictly forbidden to go with him, or with any of the servants,\r\nwithout the express consent, each time, of her father or of Bertha.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard, while doing wrong in one thing, to enjoy an approving\r\nconscience in another thing; and Noddy found it so in the present\r\ninstance. We do not mean to say that Noddy's conscience was of any great\r\naccount to him, or that the inward monitor caused his present\r\nuneasiness. He had a conscience, but his vagabond life had demoralized\r\nit in the first place, and it had not been sufficiently developed,\r\nduring his stay at Woodville, to abate very sensibly his anticipated\r\npleasure at the circus. His uneasiness was entirely selfish. He had got\r\ninto a scrape, whose probable consequences worried him more than his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nBy the time the runaways reached Whitestone, the boat-house was all\r\nburned up, and nothing but the curling smoke from the ruins visibly\r\nreminded the transgressors of the event which had disturbed them.\r\nSecuring the boat in a proper place, Noddy conducted the young lady to\r\nthe large tent in which the circus company performed, and which was more\r\nthan a mile from the river. Fanny gave him the money, and Noddy\r\npurchased two tickets, which admitted them to the interior of the tent.\r\n\r\nIf Noddy had been entirely at ease about the affair on the other side of\r\nthe river, no doubt he would have enjoyed the performance very much; but\r\nin the midst of the \"grand entree of all the horses and riders of the\r\ntroupe,\" the sorrowing face of Bertha Grant thrust itself between him\r\nand the horsemen, to obscure his vision and diminish the cheap glories\r\nof the gorgeous scene. When \"the most daring rider in the world\" danced\r\nabout, like a top, on the bare back of his \"fiery, untamed steed,\" Noddy\r\nwas enthusiastic, and would have given a York shilling for the\r\nprivilege of trying to do it himself.\r\n\r\nThe \"ground and lofty tumbling,\" with the exception of the spangled\r\ntunics of the performers, hardly came up to his expectations; and he was\r\nentirely satisfied that he could beat the best man among them at such\r\ngames. As the performance proceeded, he warmed up enough to forget the\r\nfire, and ceased to dread the rebuke of Bertha; but when all was\r\nover,--when the clown had made his last wry face, and the great American\r\nacrobat had achieved his last gyration, Bertha and the fire came back to\r\nhim with increased power. Moody and sullen, he walked down to the river\r\nwith Fanny, who, under ordinary circumstances, would have been too proud\r\nto walk through the streets of Whitestone with him. If he had been\r\nalone, it is quite probable that he would have taken to the woods, so\r\nmuch did he dread to return to Woodville.\r\n\r\nHe pushed off the boat, and for some time he pulled in silence, for Miss\r\nFanny now appeared to have her own peculiar trials. Her conscience\r\nseemed to have found a voice, and she did not speak till the boat had\r\nreached the lower end of Van Alstine's Island.\r\n\r\n\"The fire is all out now,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but I would give a thousand dollars to know how it caught,\" added\r\nNoddy.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" continued Fanny, looking down into the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Who did it?\" demanded Noddy, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I did it myself,\" answered Fanny, looking up into his face to note the\r\neffect of the astonishing confession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA MORAL QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoddy dropped his oars, and, with open mouth and staring eyes, gazed\r\nfixedly in silence at his gentle companion, who had so far outstripped\r\nhim in making mischief as to set fire to a building. It was too much for\r\nhim, and he found it impossible to comprehend the depravity of Miss\r\nFanny. He would not have dared to do such a thing himself, and it was\r\nimpossible to believe that she had done so tremendous a deed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" said he; and the words burst from him with\r\nexplosive force, as soon as he could find a tongue to express himself.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied Fanny, gazing at him with a kind of blank look, which\r\nwould have assured a more expert reader of the human face than Noddy\r\nNewman that she had come to a realizing sense of the magnitude of the\r\nmischief she had done.\r\n\r\n\"No, you didn't, Miss Fanny!\" exclaimed her incredulous friend. \"I know\r\nyou didn't do that; you couldn't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I did; I wouldn't say I did if I didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that beats me all to pieces!\" added Noddy, bending forward in his\r\nseat, and looking sharply into her face, in search of any indications\r\nthat she was making fun of him, or was engaged in perpetrating a joke.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was no indication of a want of seriousness on the part\r\nof the wayward young lady; on the contrary, she looked exceedingly\r\ntroubled. Noddy could not say a word, and he was busily occupied in\r\ntrying to get through his head the stupendous fact that Miss Fanny had\r\nbecome an incendiary; that she was wicked enough to set fire to her\r\nfather's building. It required a good deal of labor and study on the\r\npart of so poor a scholar as Noddy to comprehend the idea. He had always\r\nlooked upon Fanny as Bertha's sister. His devoted benefactress was an\r\nangel in his estimation, and it was as impossible for her to do anything\r\nwrong as it was for water to run up hill.\r\n\r\nIf Bertha was absolutely perfect,--as he measured human virtue,--it was\r\nimpossible that her sister should be very far below her standard. He\r\nknew that she was a little wild and wayward, but it was beyond his\r\ncomprehension that she should do anything that was really \"naughty.\"\r\nFanny's confession, when he realized that it was true, gave him a shock\r\nfrom which he did not soon recover. One of his oars had slipped\r\noverboard without his notice, and the other might have gone after it, if\r\nhis companion had not reminded him where he was, and what he ought to\r\ndo. Paddling the boat around with one oar, he recovered the other; but\r\nhe had no clear idea of the purpose for which such implements were\r\nintended, and he permitted the boat to drift with the tide, while he\r\ngave himself up to the consideration of the difficult and trying\r\nquestion which the conduct of Fanny imposed upon him.\r\n\r\nNoddy was not selfish; and if the generous vein of his nature had been\r\nwell balanced and fortified by the corresponding virtues, his character\r\nwould have soared to the region of the noble and grand in human nature.\r\nBut the generous in character is hardly worthy of respect, though it may\r\nchallenge the admiration of the thoughtless, unless it rests upon the\r\nsure foundation of moral principle. Noddy forgot his own trials in\r\nsympathizing with the unpleasant situation of his associate in\r\nwrongdoing, and his present thought was how he should get her out of the\r\nscrape. He was honestly willing to sacrifice himself for her sake. While\r\nhe was faithfully considering the question, in the dim light of his own\r\nmoral sense, Miss Fanny suddenly burst into tears, and cried with a\r\nviolence and an unction which were a severe trial to his nerves.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry, Fanny,\" said he; \"I'll get you out of the scrape.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to get out of it,\" sobbed she.\r\n\r\nNow, this was the most paradoxical reply which the little maiden could\r\npossibly have made, and Noddy was perplexed almost beyond the hope of\r\nredemption. What in the world was she crying about, if she did not wish\r\nto get out of the scrape? What could make her cry if it was not the fear\r\nof consequences--of punishment, and of the mean opinion which her\r\nfriends would have of her, when they found out that she was wicked\r\nenough to set a building on fire? Noddy asked no questions, for he could\r\nnot frame one which would cover so intricate a matter.\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly willing to be punished for what I have done,\" added\r\nFanny, to whose troubled heart speech was the only vent.\r\n\r\n\"What are you crying for?\" asked the bewildered Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Because--because I did it,\" replied she; and her choked utterance\r\nhardly permitted her to speak the words.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Miss Fanny, you are altogether ahead of my time; and I don't know\r\nwhat you mean. If you cry about it now, what did you do it for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I was wicked and naughty. If I had thought only a moment, I\r\nshouldn't have done it. I am so sorry I did it! I would give the world\r\nif I hadn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will they do to you?\" asked Noddy, whose fear of consequences had\r\nnot yet given place to a higher view of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what they do; I deserve the worst they can do. How shall I\r\nlook Bertha and my father in the face when I see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, hold your head right up, and look as bold as a lion--as bold as two\r\nlions, if the worst comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so, Noddy. You make me feel worse than I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the world ails you, Miss Fanny?\" demanded Noddy, grown\r\ndesperate by the perplexities of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"I am so sorry I did such a wicked thing! I shall go to Bertha and my\r\nfather, and tell them all about it, as soon as they come home,\" added\r\nFanny, as she wiped away her tears, and appeared to be much comforted by\r\nthe good resolution which was certainly the best one the circumstances\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to do that?\" exclaimed Noddy, astonished at the\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And get me into a scrape too! They won't let me off as easy as they do\r\nyou. I shall be sent off to learn to be a tinker, or a blacksmith.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't set the boat-house on fire, Noddy. It wasn't any of your\r\ndoings,\" said Fanny, somewhat disturbed by this new complication.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't have done it, if it hadn't been for me. I told you what I\r\nsaid to Ben--that I wished the boat-house was burned up; and that's what\r\nput it into your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you didn't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that; but I shall have to bear all the blame of it.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy's moral perceptions were strong enough to enable him to see that\r\nhe was not without fault in the matter; and he was opposed to Fanny's\r\nmaking the intended confession of her guilt.\r\n\r\n\"I will keep you out of trouble, Noddy,\" said she, kindly.\r\n\r\n\"You can't do it; when you own up, you will sink me to the bottom of the\r\nriver. Besides, you are a fool to do any such thing, Miss Fanny. What do\r\nyou want to say a word about it for? Ben will think some fellow landed\r\nfrom the river, and set the boat-house on fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must do it, Noddy,\" protested she. \"I shall not have a moment's peace\r\ntill I confess. I shall not dare to look father and Bertha in the face\r\nif I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't if you do. How are they going to know anything about it, if\r\nyou don't tell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they will lay it to you if I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter if they do; I didn't do it, and I can say so truly, and they\r\nwill believe me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall I feel all the time? I shall know who did it, if nobody\r\nelse does. I shall feel mean and guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't feel half so bad as you will when they look at you, and know\r\nall the time that you are guilty. If you are going to own up, I shall\r\nkeep out of the way. You won't see me at Woodville again in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Noddy?\" asked Fanny, startled by the strong words of\r\nher companion.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I mean. If you own up, they will say that I made you\r\ndo it; and I had enough sight rather bear the blame of setting the\r\nboat-house afire, than be told that I made you do it. I can dirty my own\r\nhands, but I don't like the idea of dirtying yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to leave Woodville, Noddy?\" asked Fanny, in a\r\nreproachful tone.\r\n\r\n\"If you own up, I shall not go back. I've been thinking of going ever\r\nsince they talked of making a tinker of me; so it will only be going a\r\nfew days sooner. I want to go to sea, and I don't want to be a tinker.\"\r\n\r\nFanny gazed into the water by the side of the boat, thinking of what her\r\ncompanion had said. She really did not think she ought to \"own up,\" on\r\nthe terms which Noddy mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"If you are sorry, and want to repent, you can do all that; and I will\r\ngive you my solemn promise to be as good as you are, Miss Fanny,\" said\r\nNoddy, satisfied that he had made an impression upon the mind of his\r\nwavering companion.\r\n\r\nHis advice seemed to be sensible. She was sorry she had done wrong; she\r\ncould repent in sorrow and silence, and never do wrong again. Her father\r\nand her sister would despise her if they knew she had done such a wicked\r\nand unladylike thing as to set the boat-house on fire. She could save\r\nall this pain and mortification, and repent just the same. Besides, she\r\ncould not take upon herself the responsibility of driving Noddy away\r\nfrom Woodville, for that would cause Bertha a great deal of pain and\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nFanny had not yet learned to do right though the heavens fall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I won't say anything about it, Noddy,\" said she, yielding to what\r\nseemed to her the force of circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Fanny. Now, you leave the whole thing to me, and I will\r\nmanage it so as to keep you out of trouble; and you can repent and be\r\nsorry just as much as you please,\" replied Noddy, as he began to row\r\nagain. \"There is nothing to be afraid of. Ben will never know that we\r\nhave been on the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I know it myself,\" said the conscience-stricken maiden.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you do; what of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I didn't know it myself, I should feel well enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a funny girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you ever feel that you have done wrong, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I do; but I don't make any such fuss about it as you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were not brought up by a kind father and a loving sister, who would\r\ngive anything rather than have you do wrong,\" said Fanny, beginning to\r\ncry again.\r\n\r\n\"There! don't cry any more; if you do, you will 'let the cat out of the\r\nbag.' I am going to land you here at the Glen. You can take a walk\r\nthere, and go home about one o'clock. Then you can tell the folks you\r\nhave been walking in the Glen; and it will be the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be just as much a lie as though I hadn't been there. It will be\r\none half the truth told to hide the other half.\"\r\n\r\nThis was rather beyond Noddy's moral philosophy, and he did not worry\r\nhimself to argue the point. He pulled up to the landing place at the\r\nGlen, where he had so often conveyed Bertha, and near the spot where he\r\nhad met with the accident which had placed him under her kindly care.\r\nFanny, with a heavy heart and a doubting mind, stepped on shore, and\r\nwalked up into the grove. She was burdened with grief for the wrong she\r\nhad done, and for half an hour she wandered about the beautiful spot,\r\ntrying to compose herself enough to appear before the people at the\r\nhouse. When it was too late, she wished she had not consented to Noddy's\r\nplan; but the fear of working a great wrong in driving him from the good\r\ninfluences to which he was subjected at Woodville, by doing right, and\r\nconfessing her error, was rather comforting, though it did not meet the\r\nwants of her case.\r\n\r\nIn season for dinner, she entered the house with her hand full of wild\r\nflowers, which grew only in the Glen. In the hall she met Mrs. Green,\r\nthe housekeeper, who looked at her flushed face, and then at the flowers\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n\"We have been wondering where you were, all the forenoon,\" said Mrs.\r\nGreen. \"I see you have been to the Glen by the flowers you have in your\r\nhand. Did you know the boat-house was burned up?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw the smoke of it,\" replied Fanny.\r\n\r\n\"It is the strangest thing that ever happened. No one can tell how it\r\ntook fire.\"\r\n\r\nFanny made no reply, and the housekeeper hastened away to attend to her\r\nduties. The poor girl was suffering all the tortures of remorse which a\r\nwrong act can awaken, and she went up to her room with the feeling that\r\nshe did not wish to see another soul for a month.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, Noddy Newman presented himself at the great house,\r\nladen with swamp pinks, whose fragrance filled the air, and seemed to\r\nexplain where he had been all the forenoon. With no little flourish, he\r\nrequested Mrs. Green to put them in the vases for Bertha's room; for his\r\nyoung mistress was very fond of the sweet blossoms. He appeared to be\r\nentirely satisfied with himself; and, with a branch of the pink in his\r\nhand, he left the house, and walked towards the servants' quarters,\r\nwhere, at his dinner, he met Ben, the boatman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNODDY'S CONFESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old boatman never did any thing as other people did it; and though\r\nNoddy had put on the best face he could assume to meet the shock of the\r\naccusation which he was confident would be brought against him, Ben said\r\nnot a word about the boat-house. He did not seem to be aware that it had\r\nbeen burned. He ate his dinner in his usual cheerful frame of mind, and\r\ntalked of swamp pinks, suggested by the branch which the young reprobate\r\nhad brought into the servants' hall.\r\n\r\nNoddy was more perplexed than he had been before that day. Why didn't\r\nthe old man \"pitch into him,\" and accuse him of kindling the fire? Why\r\ndidn't he get angry, as he did sometimes, and call him a young vagabond,\r\nand threaten to horsewhip him? Ben talked of the pinks, of the weather,\r\nthe crops, and the latest news; but he did not say a word about the\r\ndestruction of the boat-house, or Noddy's absence during the forenoon.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Noddy followed the old man down to the pier by the river\r\nin a state of anxiety which hardly permitted him to keep up the cheerful\r\nexpression he had assumed, and which he usually wore. They reached the\r\nsmouldering ruins of the building, but Ben took no notice of it, and did\r\nnot allude to the great event which had occurred. Noddy was inclined to\r\ndoubt whether the boat-house had been burned at all; and he would have\r\nrejected the fact, if the charred remains of the house had not been\r\nthere to attest it.\r\n\r\nBen hobbled down to the pier, and stepped on board the Greyhound, which\r\nhe had hauled up to the shore to enable him to make some repairs on the\r\nmainsail. Noddy followed him; but he grew more desperate at every step\r\nhe advanced, for the old man still most provokingly refused to say a\r\nsingle word about the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious!\" exclaimed Noddy, suddenly starting back in the utmost\r\nastonishment; for he had come to the conclusion, that if Ben would not\r\nspeak about the fire, he must.\r\n\r\nThe old boatman was still vicious, and refused even to notice his\r\nwell-managed exclamation. Noddy thought it was very obstinate of Ben not\r\nto say something, and offer him a chance, in the natural way, to prove\r\nhis innocence.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Ben, the boat-house is burned up!\" shouted Noddy, determined that\r\nthe old man should have no excuse for not speaking about the fire.\r\n\r\nBen did not even raise his eyes from the work on which he was engaged.\r\nHe was adjusting the palm on his hand, and in a moment began to sew as\r\nthough nothing had happened, and no one was present but himself. Noddy\r\nwas fully satisfied now that the boatman was carrying out the details of\r\nsome plot of his own.\r\n\r\n\"Ben!\" roared Noddy, at the top of his lungs, and still standing near\r\nthe ruins.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want, Noddy?\" demanded Ben, as good-naturedly as though\r\neverything had worked well during the day.\r\n\r\n\"The boat-house is burned up!\" screamed Noddy, apparently as much\r\nexcited as though he had just discovered the fact.\r\n\r\nBen made no reply, which was another evidence that he was engaged in\r\nworking out some deep-laid plot, perhaps to convict him of the crime,\r\nby some trick. Noddy was determined not to be convicted if he could\r\npossibly help it.\r\n\r\n\"Ben!\" shouted he again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Noddy, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you _know_ the boat-house was burned up?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer; and Noddy ran down to the place where the sail-boat\r\nwas hauled up. He tried to look excited and indignant, and perhaps he\r\nsucceeded; though, as the old man preserved his equanimity, he had no\r\nmeans of knowing what impression he had produced.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know the boat-house was burned up?\" repeated Noddy, opening his\r\neyes as though he had made a discovery of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied Ben, as indifferently as though it had been a matter of\r\nno consequence whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me about it?\" demanded Noddy, with becoming\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\"Because I decided that I wouldn't say a word about it to any person,\"\r\nanswered Ben.\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't anything to say about it; so you mustn't ask me any\r\nquestions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know how it caught afire?\" persisted Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"I've nothing to say on that subject.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was vexed and disheartened; but he felt that it would not be\r\nprudent to deny the charge of setting it on fire before he was accused,\r\nfor that would certainly convict him. The old man was playing a deep\r\ngame, and that annoyed him still more.\r\n\r\n\"So you won't say anything about it, Ben?\" added he, seating himself on\r\nthe pier.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't if I were you,\" continued Noddy, lightly.\r\n\r\nBen took no notice of this sinister remark, thus exhibiting a presence\r\nof mind which completely balked his assailant.\r\n\r\n\"I understand it all, Ben; and I don't blame you for not wanting to say\r\nanything about it. I suppose you will own up when Mr. Grant comes home\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be saucy, Noddy,\" said the old man, mildly.\r\n\r\n\"So you smoked your pipe among the shavings, and set the boat-house\r\nafire--did you, Ben? Well, I am sorry for you, you are generally so\r\ncareful; but I don't believe they will discharge you for it.\"\r\n\r\nBen was as calm and unruffled as a summer sea. Noddy knew that, under\r\nordinary circumstances, the boatman would have come down upon him like a\r\nnortheast gale, if he had dared to use such insulting language to him.\r\nHe tried him on every tack, but not a word could he obtain which\r\nbetrayed the opinion of the veteran, in regard to the origin of the\r\nfire. It was useless to resort to any more arts, and he gave up the\r\npoint in despair. All the afternoon he wandered about the estate, and\r\ncould think of nothing but the unhappy event of the morning. Fanny did\r\nnot show herself, and he had no opportunity for further consultation.\r\n\r\nAbout six o'clock Bertha returned with her father; and after tea they\r\nwalked down to the river. Fanny complained of a headache, and did not go\r\nwith them. It is more than probable that she was really afflicted, as\r\nshe said; for she had certainly suffered enough to make her head ache.\r\nOf course the first thing that attracted the attention of Mr. Grant and\r\nhis daughter was the pile of charred timbers that indicated the place\r\nwhere the boat-house had once stood.\r\n\r\n\"How did that happen?\" asked Mr. Grant of Ben, who was on the pier.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how it happened,\" replied the boatman, who had found his\r\ntongue now, and proceeded to give his employer all the particulars of\r\nthe destruction of the building, concluding with Noddy's energetic\r\nexclamation that he wished the boat-house was burned up.\r\n\r\n\"But did Noddy set the building on fire?\" asked Bertha, greatly pained\r\nto hear this charge against her pupil.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Miss Bertha. I went up to the house to get my morning\r\ninstructions, as I always do, and left Noddy at work washing up the\r\nboat-house. I found you had gone to the city, and I went right out of\r\nthe house, and was coming down here. I got in sight of the pier, and saw\r\nMiss Fanny come out of the boat-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fanny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I am sure it was her. I didn't mind where she went, for I happened\r\nto think the mainsail of the Greyhound wanted a little mending, and I\r\nwent over to my room after some needles. While I was in my chamber, one\r\nof the gardeners rushed up to tell me the boat-house was afire. I came\r\ndown, but 'twasn't no use; the building was most gone when I got here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you leave anything in the building in the shape of matches, or\r\nanything else?\" asked Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I never do that,\" replied the old man, with a blush.\r\n\r\n\"I know you are very careful, Ben. Then I suppose it was set on fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it was, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who do you suppose set it afire, Ben?\" said Bertha, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, miss, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it was Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Miss Bertha, I don't think it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who could it have been?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's more than I know. Here comes Noddy, and he can speak for\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy had come forward for this purpose when he saw Mr. Grant and Bertha\r\non the pier, and he had heard the last part of the conversation. He was\r\nnot a little astonished to hear Ben declare his belief that he was not\r\nguilty, for he had been fully satisfied that he should have all the\r\ncredit of the naughty transaction.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know how the fire caught, Noddy?\" said Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon it caught from a bucket of water I left there,\" replied Noddy,\r\nwho did not know what to say till he had felt his way a little.\r\n\r\n\"No trifling, Noddy!\" added Mr. Grant, though he could hardly keep from\r\nlaughing at the ridiculous answer.\r\n\r\n\"How should I know, sir, when Ben don't know? I tried to make him tell\r\nme how it caught, and he wouldn't say a word about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was best for me to keep still,\" said Ben.\r\n\r\n\"This is very strange,\" continued Mr. Grant. \"Who was the last person\r\nyou saw in the boat-house, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Fanny, sir. I saw her come out of it only a few moments before the\r\nfire broke out.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was appalled at this answer, for it indicated that Fanny was\r\nalready suspected of the deed.\r\n\r\n\"Of course Fanny would not do such a thing as set the boat-house on\r\nfire,\" said Bertha.\r\n\r\n\"Of course she wouldn't,\" added Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"What made you say you did not think Noddy set the fire, Ben?\" asked Mr.\r\nGrant.\r\n\r\n\"Because I think he had gone off somewhere before the fire, and that\r\nMiss Fanny was in the building after he was. Noddy was sculling off\r\nbefore he had done his work, and I called him back. That's when he\r\nwished the boat-house was burned down.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is pretty evident that the fire was set by Noddy or Fanny,\" said Mr.\r\nGrant; and he appeared to have no doubt as to which was the guilty one,\r\nfor he looked very sternly at the wayward boy before him.\r\n\r\n\"I think so, sir,\" added Ben.\r\n\r\n\"And you say that it was not Noddy?\" continued Mr. Grant, looking\r\nexceedingly troubled as he considered the alternative.\r\n\r\nThe boatman bowed his head in reply, as though his conclusion was so\r\nserious and solemn that he could not express it in words. Noddy looked\r\nfrom Ben to Mr. Grant, and from Mr. Grant to Ben again. It was plain\r\nenough what they meant, and he had not even been suspected of the crime.\r\nThe boatman had seen Fanny come out of the building just before the\r\nflames appeared, and all hope of charging the deed upon some vagabond\r\nfrom the river was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say, Ben, that you think Fanny set the boat-house on\r\nfire?\" demanded Mr. Grant, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see who else could have set it,\" added Ben, stoutly.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" interposed Noddy. \"I say she didn't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I did it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so!\" exclaimed Mr. Grant, greatly relieved by the confession.\r\n\r\nBen was confused and annoyed, and Noddy was rather pleased at the\r\nposition in which he had placed the old man, who, in his opinion, had\r\nnot treated him as well as usual.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you own it before?\" said Mr. Grant, \"and not allow an\r\ninnocent person to be suspected.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't like to,\" answered the culprit, with a smile, as though he was\r\nentirely satisfied with his own position.\r\n\r\n\"You must be taken care of.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to take care of myself, sir,\" said Noddy, with easy\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nThis remark was capable of so many interpretations that no one knew what\r\nit meant--whether Noddy intended to run away, or reform his vicious\r\nhabits. Bertha had never seen him look so self-possessed and impudent\r\nwhen he had done wrong, and she feared that all her labors for his moral\r\nimprovement had been wasted.\r\n\r\nSome further explanations followed, and Noddy was questioned till a\r\nsatisfactory theory in regard to the fire was agreed upon. The boy\r\ndeclared that he had visited the boat-house after Fanny left it, and\r\nthat she was walking towards the Glen when he kindled the fire. He made\r\nout a consistent story, and completely upset Ben's conclusions, and left\r\nthe veteran in a very confused and uncomfortable state of mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant declared that something must be done with the boy at once;\r\nthat if he was permitted to continue on the place, he might take a\r\nnotion to burn the house down. Poor Bertha could not gainsay her\r\nfather's conclusion, and, sad as it was, she was compelled to leave the\r\nculprit to whatever decision Mr. Grant might reach. For the present he\r\nwas ordered to his room, to which he submissively went, attended by\r\nBertha, though he was fully resolved not to be \"taken care of;\" for he\r\nunderstood this to mean a place in the workhouse or the penitentiary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSQUIRE WRIGGS AT WOODVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBertha was deeply pained at the reckless wrong which her _protege_ had\r\ndone, and more deeply by the cool indifference with which he carried\r\nhimself after his voluntary confession. There was little to hope for\r\nwhile he manifested not a single sign of contrition for the crime\r\ncommitted. He was truly sorry for the grief he had caused her; but for\r\nhis own sin he did not speak a word of regret.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I am to be a tinker now,\" said Noddy to her, with a smile,\r\nwhich looked absolutely awful to Bertha, for it was a token of depravity\r\nshe could not bear to look upon.\r\n\r\n\"I must leave you now, Noddy, for you are not good,\" replied Bertha,\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry you feel so bad about me, Miss Bertha,\" added Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would be sorry for yourself, instead of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am--sorry that you want to make a tinker of me;\" and Noddy used this\r\nword to express his contempt of any mechanical occupation.\r\n\r\nHe did not like to work. Patient, plodding labor, devoid of excitement,\r\nwas his aversion; though handling a boat, cleaning out a gutter on some\r\ndizzy height of the mansion, or cutting off a limb at the highest point\r\nof the tallest shade tree on the estate, was entirely to his taste, and\r\nhe did not regard anything as work which had a spice of danger or a\r\nthrill of excitement about it. He was not lazy, in the broad sense of\r\nthe word; there was not a more active and restless person on the estate\r\nthan himself. A shop, therefore, was a horror which he had no words to\r\ndescribe, and which he could never endure.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see you in some useful occupation, where you can earn your\r\nliving, and become a respectable man,\" said Bertha. \"Don't you want to\r\nbe a respectable man, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose I do; but I had rather be a vagabond than a respectable\r\ntinker.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must work, Noddy, if you would win a good name, and enough of this\r\nworld's goods to make you comfortable. Work and win; I give you this\r\nmotto for your guidance. My father told me to lock you up in your room.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may do that, Miss Bertha,\" laughed Noddy. \"I don't care how much\r\nyou lock me in. When I want to go out, I shall go. I shall work, and win\r\nmy freedom.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy thought this application of Bertha's motto was funny, and he had\r\nthe hardihood to laugh at it, till Bertha, hopeless of making any\r\nimpression on him at the present time, left the room, and locked the\r\ndoor behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Work and win!\" said Noddy. \"That's very pretty, and for Miss Bertha's\r\nsake I shall remember it; but I shan't work in any tinker's shop. I may\r\nas well take myself off, and go to work in my own way.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was tired, after the exertions of the day; and so deeply and truly\r\nrepentant was he for the wrong he had done, that he immediately went to\r\nsleep, though it was not yet dark. Neither the present nor the future\r\nseemed to give him any trouble; and if he could avoid the miseries of\r\nthe tinker's shop, as he was perfectly confident he could, he did not\r\nconcern himself about any of the prizes of life which are gained by\r\nhonest industry or patient well doing.\r\n\r\nWhen it was quite dark, and Noddy had slept about two hours, the\r\nspringing of the bolt in the lock of his door awoke him. He leaped to\r\nhis feet, and his first thought was, that something was to be done with\r\nhim for burning the boat-house. But the door opened, and, by the dim\r\nlight which came through the window, he recognized the slight form of\r\nFanny Grant.\r\n\r\n\"Noddy,\" said she, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Miss Fanny, have you come to let me out of jail?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I came to see you, and nobody knows I am here. You won't expose\r\nme--will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I won't; that isn't much like me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it isn't, Noddy. What did you say that you set the fire for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I thought that was the best way to settle the whole thing. Ben\r\nsaw you come out of the boat-house, and told your father he believed you\r\nset the building on fire. That was the meanest thing the old man ever\r\ndid. Why didn't he lay it to me, as he ought to have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he knew you didn't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That don't make any difference. He ought to have known better than tell\r\nyour father it was you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so sorry for what you have done!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you sorry for? It won't hurt me, any how; and it would be an\r\nawful thing for you. They were going to make a tinker of me before, and\r\nI suppose they will do it now--if they can. I wouldn't care a fig for it\r\nif Miss Bertha didn't feel so bad about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell her the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do it, Miss Fanny. That wouldn't help me a bit, and will\r\nspoil you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I must tell the truth. They don't suspect me even of going on the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better. They won't ask you any hard questions. Now, Miss\r\nFanny, don't you say a word; for if you do, it will make it all the\r\nworse for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, according to my notion, I did set the building afire. If I\r\nhadn't said what I did, you never would have thought of doing it. So I\r\nwas the fellow that did it, after all. That's the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you didn't set it afire, and you didn't mean to do any such thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be; but you wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been for me. It\r\nwas more my fault than it was yours; and I want you to leave the thing\r\njust where it is now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it would be mean for me to stand still, and see you bear all the\r\nblame.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be enough sight meaner for you to say anything about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do; for don't you see it is a good deal worse for me to put you up to\r\nsuch a thing than it was for me to do it myself? Your father would\r\nforgive me for setting the fire sooner than they would for making you do\r\nit. I'm bad enough already, and they know it; but if they think I make\r\nyou as bad as I am myself, they would put me in a worse place than a\r\ntinker's shop.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy's argument was too much for the feminine mind of Miss Fanny, and\r\nagain she abandoned the purpose she had fully resolved upon, and decided\r\nnot to confess her guilt. We must do her the justice to say, that she\r\ncame to this conclusion, not from any fear of personal consequences, but\r\nin order to save Noddy from the terrible reproach which would be cast\r\nupon him if she did confess. Already, in her heart and before God, she\r\nhad acknowledged her error, and was sorrowfully repenting her\r\nmisconduct. But she could not expose Noddy to any penalty which he did\r\nnot deserve. She knew that he did not mean to set the fire; that his\r\nwords were idle, petulant ones, which had no real meaning; and it would\r\nbe wrong to let her father and Bertha suppose that Noddy had instigated\r\nher to the criminal act.\r\n\r\nFanny had not yet learned that it is best to cleave unto the truth, and\r\nlet the consequences take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nShe yielded her own convictions to those of another, which no person\r\nshould ever do in questions of right and wrong.\r\n\r\nShe sacrificed her own faith in the simple truth, to another's faith in\r\npolicy, expediency.\r\n\r\nThe question was settled for the present, and Fanny crept back to her\r\nchamber, no easier in mind, no better satisfied with herself, than\r\nbefore. Noddy went to sleep again; but the only cloud he saw was the\r\ndispleasure of Bertha. He was simply conscious that he had got into a\r\nscrape. He had not burned the boat-house, and he did not feel guilty.\r\nHe had not intended to induce Fanny to do the deed, and he did not feel\r\nguilty of that. He was so generous that he wished to save her from the\r\nconsequences of her error, and the deception he used did not weigh very\r\nheavily on his conscience.\r\n\r\nHe regarded his situation as merely a \"scrape\" into which he had\r\naccidentally fallen, and his only business was to get out of it. These\r\nthoughts filled his mind when he awoke in the morning. He was too\r\nrestless to remain a quiet prisoner for any great length of time; and\r\nwhen he had dressed himself, he began to look about him for the means of\r\nmitigating his imprisonment, or bringing it to a conclusion, as the case\r\nmight require. The window would be available at night, but it was in\r\nfull view of the gardeners in the daytime, who would be likely to report\r\nany movement on his part. The door looked more hopeful.\r\n\r\nOne of the men brought his breakfast, and retired, locking the door\r\nbehind him. While he was eating it,--and his appetite did not seem to be\r\nat all impaired by the situation to which he had been reduced,--he saw\r\nMr. Grant on the lawn, talking with a stranger. His interest was at once\r\nexcited, and a closer examination assured him that the visitor was\r\nSquire Wriggs, of Whitestone. The discovery almost spoiled Noddy's\r\nappetite, for he knew that the squire was a lawyer, and had often been\r\nmixed up with cases of house-breaking, horse-stealing, robbery, and\r\nmurder; and he at once concluded that the legal gentleman's business\r\nrelated to him.\r\n\r\nHis ideas of lawyers were rather confused and indistinct. He knew they\r\nhad a great deal to do in the court-house, when men were sent to the\r\npenitentiary and the house of correction for various crimes. He watched\r\nthe squire and Mr. Grant, and he was fully satisfied in his own mind\r\nwhat they were talking about when the latter pointed to the window of\r\nhis chamber. He had eaten only half his breakfast, but he found it\r\nimpossible to take another mouthful, after he realized that he was the\r\nsubject of the conversation between Mr. Grant and the lawyer.\r\n\r\nIt seemed just as though all his friends, even Miss Bertha, had suddenly\r\ndeserted him. That conference on the lawn was simply a plot to take him\r\nto the court-house, and then send him to the penitentiary, the house of\r\ncorrection, or some other abominable place, even if it were no worse\r\nthan a tinker's shop. He was absolutely terrified at the prospect.\r\nAfter all his high hopes, and all his confidence in his supple limbs,\r\nthe judges, the lawyers, and the constables might fetter his muscles so\r\nthat he could not get away--so that he could not even run away to sea,\r\nwhich was his ultimate intention, whenever he could make up his mind to\r\nleave Miss Bertha.\r\n\r\nNoddy watched the two gentlemen on the lawn, and his breast was filled\r\nwith a storm of emotions. He pictured the horrors of the prison to which\r\nthey were about to send him, and his fancy made the prospect far worse\r\nthan the reality could possibly have been. Mr. Grant led the way towards\r\nthe building occupied by the servants. Noddy was desperate. Squire\r\nWriggs was the visible manifestation of jails, courts, constables, and\r\nother abominations, which were the sum of all that was terrible. He\r\ndecided at once not to wait for a visit from the awful personage, who\r\nwas evidently coming into the house to see him.\r\n\r\nHe raised the window a little, intending to throw it wide open, and leap\r\ndown upon the lawn, when his persecutor entered the door. There was not\r\na man or boy at Woodville who could catch him when he had the use of\r\nhis legs, and the world would then be open to him. But the gentlemen\r\npaused at the door, and Noddy listened as a criminal would wait to hear\r\nhis sentence from the stern judge.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty thousand dollars is a great deal of money for a boy like him,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Grant. \"Of course he must have a guardian.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are the best person in the world for that position,\" added\r\nSquire Wriggs.\r\n\r\n\"But he is a young reprobate, and something must be done with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; he must be taken care of at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid he will burn my house down, as he did the boat-house. My\r\ndaughter is interested in him; if it wasn't for her, I would send him to\r\nthe house of correction before I slept again.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you are his guardian, you can do what you think best for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be no easy matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will take the boy over to the court now, and then--\"\r\n\r\nNoddy did not hear any more, for the two gentlemen entered the house,\r\nand he heard their step on the stairs. But he did not want to know\r\nanything more. Squire Wriggs had distinctly said they would take him\r\nover to the court, and that was enough to satisfy him that his worst\r\nfears were to be realized. The talk about thirty thousand dollars, and\r\nthe guardian, was as unintelligible to him as though it had been in\r\nancient Greek, and he did not bestow a second thought upon it. The \"boy\r\nlike him,\" to whom thirty thousand dollars would be a great deal of\r\nmoney, meant some other person than himself. The court was Noddy's\r\npeculiar abomination; and when he heard the words, he clutched the sash\r\nof the window with convulsive energy.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant and Squire Wriggs passed into the house, and Noddy Newman\r\npassed out. To a gymnast of his wiry experience, the feat was not\r\nimpossible, or even very difficult. Swinging out of the window, he\r\nplaced his feet on the window-cap below, and then, stooping down, he got\r\nhold with his hands, and slipped down from his perch with about the same\r\nease with which a well-trained monkey would have accomplished the\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nHe was on the solid earth now, and with the feeling that the court-house\r\nand a whole regiment of constables were behind him, he took to his\r\nheels. A stiff-kneed gardener, who had observed his exit from the\r\nhouse, attempted to follow him; but he might as well have chased a\r\nnorthwest gale. Noddy reached the Glen, and no sound of pursuers could\r\nbe heard. The phantom court-house had been beaten in the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nNODDY'S ENGAGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Noddy reached the Glen, he had time to stop and think; and the\r\nconsequences of the sudden step he had taken came to his mind with\r\ntremendous force. He had fled from Miss Bertha, and all the comforts and\r\nluxuries which had surrounded him at Woodville. He was a vagabond again.\r\n\r\nIt was a great deal better to be a vagabond than it was to be an inmate\r\nof a prison, or even of a tinker's shop. He had committed no crime; the\r\nworst that could be said of him was, that he was a victim of\r\ncircumstances. It was unfortunate for him that he had used those\r\npetulant words, that he wished the boat-house was burned down, for they\r\nhad put the idea into Fanny's head. He did not mean to kindle the fire,\r\nbut he believed that he had been the cause of it, and that it was hardly\r\nfair to let the young lady suffer for what he had virtually done.\r\n\r\nHe was sorry to leave Woodville, and above all, sorry to be banished\r\nfrom the presence of Miss Bertha. But that had already been agreed upon,\r\nand he was only anticipating the event by taking himself off as he did.\r\nHe would rather have gone in a more honorable manner than running away\r\nlike a hunted dog; but he could not help that, and the very thought of\r\nthe horrible court-house was enough to drive him from the best home in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nHe walked up to a retired part of the Glen, where he could continue his\r\nretreat without being intercepted, if it became necessary, and sat down\r\non a rock to think of the future. He had no more idea what he should do\r\nwith himself, than he had when he was a wanderer before in these\r\nregions. Undoubtedly his ultimate purpose was to go to sea; but he was\r\nnot quite ready to depart. He cherished a hope that he might contrive to\r\nmeet Bertha in some of her walks, and say good-bye to her before he\r\ncommitted himself to his fortunes on the stormy ocean.\r\n\r\nWhile he was deliberating upon his prospects, a happy thought, as he\r\nregarded it, came to his mind. He could turn somersets, and cut more\r\ncapers than any man in the circus company which he had seen on the\r\npreceding day. With a little practice, he was satisfied that he could\r\nlearn to stand up on the back of a horse. A field of glory suddenly\r\nopened to his vision, and he could win the applause of admiring\r\nthousands by his daring feats. He had performed all sorts of gyrations\r\nfor the amusement of the idlers about Woodville, and he might now turn\r\nhis accomplishments to a useful purpose--indeed, make them pay for his\r\nfood and clothing.\r\n\r\nNoddy had no idea that circus performances were not entirely\r\nrespectable; and it seemed to him that his early training had exactly\r\nfitted him to shine in this peculiar sphere. It might not be decent\r\nbusiness for Mr. Grant and Bertha, but it was just the thing for him.\r\nWhitestone was a very large town, and the circus was still there. He had\r\nnot a moment to lose; and, under the impulse of his new resolution, he\r\nleft the Glen, intending to walk up the river to the ferry, a couple of\r\nmiles distant.\r\n\r\nNoddy went over the river, and reached the great tent of the circus\r\ncompany about one o'clock. He was rather disturbed by the fear that he\r\nmight meet Squire Wriggs, or some of the constables; but all his hopes\r\nwere now centred on the circus, and he could not avoid the risk of\r\nexposing himself. He boldly inquired for the \"head man\" of the\r\nestablishment; but this distinguished functionary was not on the\r\npremises at that time; he would be there in the course of half an hour.\r\n\r\nHe walked down to a shop, and having a small sum of money in his pocket,\r\nhe obtained something to eat. On his return to the tent, the head man\r\nwas pointed out to him. Noddy, as a general rule, was not troubled with\r\nbashfulness; and he walked resolutely up to the manager, and intimated\r\nto him that he should like to be engaged as a performer.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want, my boy?\" demanded the head man, who was quite\r\nconfident that he had mistaken the applicant's meaning, for it was\r\nhardly possible that a youth like him could be a circus performer.\r\n\r\n\"I want a place to perform, sir,\" repeated Noddy, who was entirely\r\nignorant of the technical terms belonging to the profession.\r\n\r\n\"To perform!\" laughed the manager, measuring him from head to foot with\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of business can you do, my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost anything, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I'm not much used to standing up on a horse, but I think I\r\ncould go it, after doing it a little while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you, indeed!\" sneered the man. \"Well, we don't want anybody that can\r\ndo almost any kind of business.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm used to this thing, sir,\" pleaded Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Used to it! I suppose you want a place as a bill-sticker, or to take\r\ncare of the horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I want to perform. If you will give me a chance to show what I\r\ncan do, I think you'll have me,\" persisted Noddy, not at all pleased\r\nwith the decided refusal he had received.\r\n\r\n\"Well, come in here,\" laughed the head man, who had no doubt that the\r\napplicant would soon be brought to grief.\r\n\r\nIt was almost time for the doors to be opened for the afternoon\r\nperformance, and the man conducted Noddy to the ring, where he saw a\r\nnumber of the riders and gymnasts, all dressed in their silks and\r\nspangles to appear before the public.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Whippleby, is a young man that wants an engagement,\" said the\r\nmanager to the man who had acted as ring-master when Noddy was present.\r\n\r\n\"What can he do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost everything; but he isn't much used to riding.\"\r\n\r\nWhippleby laughed, and the manager laughed; and it was quite evident,\r\neven to the aspirant for circus honors, that all present intended to\r\namuse themselves at his expense. But Noddy felt able to outdo most of\r\nthe circus people at their own profession, and he confidently expected\r\nto turn the laugh upon them before the game was ended.\r\n\r\n\"A versatile genius,\" said Whippleby.\r\n\r\n\"Just try him, and see what he can do,\" added the manager,\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my little man, what do you say to a little ground and lofty\r\ntumbling,\" said Whippleby, winking at the performers, who stood in a\r\ncircle around them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm at home in that,\" replied Noddy, throwing off his jacket.\r\n\r\n\"Good! You have got pluck enough, at any rate. Here, Nesmond, do\r\nsomething,\" said the ring-master to a wiry young man of the group.\r\n\r\nNesmond did what Noddy had seen him do the day before; he whirled over\r\nand over across the ring, like a hoop, striking his hands and feet\r\nalternately on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"There, youngster, do you see that?\" said Whippleby.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I see it,\" replied Noddy, unabashed by the work which was\r\nexpected of him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, let us see you do it.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy did it, and if anything, more rapidly and gracefully than the\r\nprofessional man. The men applauded, and Nesmond--\"the great American\r\nvaulter and tumbler\"--looked exceedingly disconcerted when he saw his\r\nwonderful act so easily imitated.\r\n\r\n\"Try it again, Nesmond,\" said Whippleby.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished athlete went on for half an hour, performing his\r\nantics; and Noddy repeated them, though he had never before attempted\r\nsome of them. Nesmond gave it up.\r\n\r\n\"Well, young man, you can do almost everything, but you are as clumsy\r\nand ungraceful as a bear about it. You need a little training on your\r\npositions, and you will make a first-class tumbler,\" said the manager.\r\n\r\nThe men had ceased to laugh, and even looked admiringly on the prodigy\r\nwho had so suddenly developed himself. Noddy felt that his fortune was\r\nalready made, and he was almost ready to snap his fingers at the\r\ncourt-house. Here was a chance for him to \"work and win,\" and it was\r\nentirely to his taste.\r\n\r\nThe manager then questioned him in regard to his family connections; but\r\nas Noddy had none, his answers were very brief. He had no father nor\r\nmother, and he had no home; he was no runaway, for there was no one\r\nliving who had any claim upon him. These answers were entirely\r\nsatisfactory to the head man.\r\n\r\n\"What salary do you expect?\" asked the manager, when he had assured\r\nhimself there was no one to interfere with any arrangement he might\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n\"What do you give?\" asked Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we give different salaries, depending on the men.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have seen what I can do--what will you give me? Talk right up, or I\r\nshall have nothing to do with it,\" added Noddy, borrowing an expression\r\nfrom a highly respectable horse jockey, who had a language of his own.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you your board and clothes, and your dresses for the first\r\nseason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of that sort for me,\" replied Noddy, promptly. \"I want to know\r\nhow much I am to have in hard cash.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; I'll give you five dollars a week, and you find yourself.\"\r\n\r\nFive dollars a week looked like a large salary to Noddy, though it was\r\nnot one-fourth of what the distinguished Mr. Nesmond received, and he\r\nimmediately closed the bargain.\r\n\r\n\"I'll put you on the bills for the next town we visit. What's your\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"Noddy Newman.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nThe embryo performer repeated his name.\r\n\r\n\"That won't do; you must have a better name than that. Arthur De\r\nForrest--how will that suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"First rate,\" replied Noddy, who was very accommodating in minor\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\"We show in Disbury to-morrow night, and you must be ready to do your\r\nbusiness then, Mr. De Forrest,\" added the manager. \"After the\r\nperformance this afternoon Mr. Whippleby will give you a few lessons.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where shall I get a dress?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will furnish you one, and take it out of your salary. You had better\r\nput it on when you practice, so as to get used to it.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was highly pleased with all these arrangements, and could not help\r\ncongratulating himself on the happy thought which had induced him to\r\njoin the circus. It was true, and he could not help noticing it, that\r\nthe men around him were not such people as Mr. Grant, and others whom he\r\nhad been in the habit of seeing at Woodville. All of them swore\r\nterribly; their breath smelt of liquor, and they talked the language of\r\na depravity to which Noddy, with all his waywardness, was a stranger.\r\nThere were boys no older than himself in the company, but they did not\r\nseem a whit less depraved than the older ones.\r\n\r\nThough the novice was not a young man of high aims and purposes, he was\r\nnot much pleased with his companions. He was what they termed \"green,\"\r\nand it was quite plain to him that there would be a fight before many\r\ndays had passed by, for he was too high-spirited to submit tamely to the\r\ninsults which were heaped upon him.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon performance, he stood at the gates of the ring,\r\nwhere the horses enter; and Mr. Whippleby sent him before the public for\r\nthe first time, to bring out a whip which had been left there.\r\n\r\n\"Noddy Newman!\" shouted a boy among the spectators.\r\n\r\nThe young athlete heard his name, and too late he remembered that he had\r\nexposed himself to the gaze of the constables, who might by this time be\r\nin search of him. During the rest of the afternoon he kept himself out\r\nof sight; but the mischief had already been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE RING-MASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the performance was over, Noddy, with the assistance of one of his\r\ncompanions, dressed himself in \"trunk and tights,\" and appeared in the\r\nring to take his first lesson in graceful movements. He could turn the\r\nsomersets, and go through with the other evolutions; but there was a\r\ncertain polish needed--so the ring-master said--to make them pass off\r\nwell. He was to assume a graceful position at the beginning and end of\r\neach act; he must recover himself without clumsiness; he must bow, and\r\nmake a flourish with his hands, when he had done a brilliant thing.\r\n\r\nNoddy had not much taste for this branch of the profession. He did not\r\nlike the bowing and the flourishing. If the feat itself did not please\r\nthe people, he could not win them by smirking. He was much pleased with\r\nhis costume, and this kept him good-natured, under the severe training\r\nof the ring-master, for a time. Mr. Whippleby was coarse and rough in\r\nhis manners. During the show he had been all grace and elegance, and did\r\nnot use any big words, but now he was as rough as a bear, and swore like\r\na pirate. He was just like a cat's paw,--he kept the sharp claws down\r\nwhile the dear people were present; but now he thrust them out.\r\n\r\nNoddy found the \"business\" was no joke. Mr. Whippleby did not so regard\r\nit, now that the training had commenced; and the novice found that he\r\nhad placed himself under a very tyrannical master. He made his bows and\r\nflourished his arms, with all the grace he could command for a time; but\r\nhe did not come up to his severe teacher's standard.\r\n\r\n\"Do that again,\" said Mr. Whippleby, with savage emphasis. \"Don't hurry\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy did it again, as slowly as he could; but he was apparently just as\r\nfar from perfection as before.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't do better than that, I'll put the whip around your legs!\"\r\nshouted the impatient ring-master. \"One of the mules could do it\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did it as well as I could,\" replied Noddy, rather tartly.\r\n\r\n\"You will do it better than that, or your legs will smart. Now do it\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy obeyed. He did not think the ring-master really intended to strike\r\nhim with the long whip he held in his hand, but supposed he was so much\r\nin the habit of threatening the clown with the lash, that he did it now\r\nfrom the force of habit. His last attempt did not satisfy Mr. Whippleby,\r\nwho stormed at him more furiously than before.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I have nothing better to do than waste my time over a\r\nblockhead like you? I haven't had my bitters yet. Now do it again; and\r\nif you fail this time you will catch it.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy turned his somerset; but he had hardly recovered himself before he\r\nreceived a smart cut from the whip in the tenderest part of his leg.\r\nThere was a young lion in the novice, and a blow from any man was more\r\nthan he could endure. He expressed his mind in regard to the outrage\r\nwith such freedom, that Mr. Whippleby lost his temper, if he ever had\r\nany to lose, and he began to lash the unfortunate youth in the most\r\nbrutal manner.\r\n\r\nNoddy, finding there was no satisfaction to be obtained by facing the\r\nring-master, fled from the spot, leaping up on the seats where the\r\nspectators sat. He was maddened to fury by the harsh treatment he had\r\nreceived; and thirsting for vengeance, he seized whatever missiles he\r\ncould find, and hurled them at his persecutor. His legs seemed to be on\r\nfire from the effects of the blows he had received. He rubbed them for a\r\nmoment, while he hurled the most bitter denunciations at the\r\nring-master.\r\n\r\n\"Now, come down, and try again,\" called Mr. Whippleby, who did not seem\r\nto be much disconcerted by what had taken place, when he had in some\r\nmeasure recovered his equanimity.\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't!\" replied Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got enough, Mr. Arthur De Forrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give _you_ enough before you get through.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this colloquy was going on, the manager appeared in the ring.\r\nWhippleby laughingly told him what had happened, and he seemed to be\r\nmuch amused by it; but the ring-master had certainly changed his tone at\r\nthe appearance of the \"head man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, my boy, come down, and let me see how well you do your business,\"\r\nsaid the manager.\r\n\r\n\"I've had enough of it,\" replied Noddy, as he returned to the ring.\r\n\"I'm not a horse, and I'm not going to be treated like one.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your initiation, my boy,\" said Whippleby. \"We always try new\r\nbeginners in that way, to find out what they are made of.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find out what I'm made of, if you hit me again with that\r\nwhip.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know now. You won't need any more, if you try to do what you are\r\ntold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to be whipped, whether I try or not,\" added Noddy,\r\ndoggedly.\r\n\r\n\"You shall not be whipped, my boy,\" said the manager. \"Now show me your\r\nground act.\"\r\n\r\nThe novice was about to comply,--for he had already come to the\r\nconclusion that the \"head man\" would protect him,--when he saw two men\r\nenter the tent. They did not belong to the company, and Noddy was quite\r\nsure he had often seen them in Whitestone.\r\n\r\n\"We don't allow visitors in here now,\" said the manager.\r\n\r\n\"We come on business. There is a boy here that we want to find,\" replied\r\none of the men.\r\n\r\n\"You must leave the tent,\" said the manager, rather sharply.\r\n\r\n\"I am a constable, and there is a boy about here that I want.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"They call him Noddy Newman.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my business,\" answered the constable, rudely. \"The boy came into\r\nthe ring this afternoon during the show, and I suppose he belongs to the\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the fellow!\" exclaimed the other constable, pointing to Noddy,\r\nwho was trying to take himself off without being noticed.\r\n\r\n\"That's Arthur De Forrest,\" interposed the manager.\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't; I've known him this five years,\" said the man who had\r\nrecognized the culprit.\r\n\r\nBoth of them walked towards Noddy, with the intention, apparently, of\r\nlaying violent hands on him; but the young gentleman in \"trunk and\r\ntights\" was not prepared to yield up his personal liberty, and he\r\nretreated.\r\n\r\nThe officers were in a position where they could stop him from leaving\r\nthe tent by either of the two entrances; and Noddy, finding his exit\r\nprevented, seized a rope which was hanging down by the centre-pole, and\r\nclimbed up out of the reach of his pursuers.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want of me?\" demanded the young athlete, as he perched\r\nhimself in a comfortable position on the \"slack-rope,\" which was\r\nsuspended to the pole.\r\n\r\n\"We shall not do you any harm, my boy,\" said one of the officers.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is good news for you; and you are wanted over at Squire Wriggs's\r\noffice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know ye! You want to take me to the court-house. You can't humbug\r\nme,\" said Noddy, fully confirmed in his suspicions by the conduct of the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"We won't hurt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to take me up.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we don't; we only want to take you up to Squire Wriggs's office.\r\nIt's all for your good.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't,\" replied Noddy. \"You can't cheat me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to cheat you. We are only sent to find you. We will not\r\narrest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know better. You can't fool me. I heard Squire Wriggs say he wanted\r\nto take me up to the court-house; and you don't catch me near no\r\ncourt-house. I know what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, my boy. Come down, and I will tell you all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I do, you let me know,\" replied Noddy, who felt so secure from\r\narrest in his present quarters that he expressed his mind with perfect\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\"We promise not to arrest you,\" persisted the constable who did the\r\ntalking. \"We have been looking for you all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may look another day, if you like,\" added the defiant refugee. \"You\r\nwant me for setting fire to the boat-house; but I am not to blame, if I\r\ndid do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know anything about the boat-house; Squire Wriggs has a lot of\r\nmoney for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't catch an old bird in any such trap as that,\" answered Noddy,\r\nshaking his head significantly.\r\n\r\nThe officers used all their powers of persuasion to induce him to come\r\ndown; but Noddy, satisfied that they had been sent by Squire Wriggs, was\r\nfully persuaded that they were trying to deceive him. The story about a\r\n\"lot of money\" for a poor boy like him, who had not a friend in the\r\nworld, was too absurd, in his estimation, to be entertained for a\r\nmoment. He had heard the squire speak to Mr. Grant about thirty thousand\r\ndollars; but such a sum was beyond his comprehension. He did not believe\r\nany man, not even the owner of Woodville, had so much money; and of\r\ncourse it was nothing to him.\r\n\r\nThe constables got out of patience at last; and though they showed no\r\nsigns of anger or malice, they exhibited an intention to catch him,\r\nwhich was much worse. One of them commenced the ascent of the pole in\r\nthe centre of the tent. The circus people, who seemed to be in full\r\nsympathy with Noddy, remained neutral, for the intruders were officers\r\nof the law, and it was not prudent to oppose them.\r\n\r\nNoddy perceived the object of his pursuers, and grasping one of the\r\ntent-ropes, he scrambled up to the very apex of the canvas structure,\r\nand crawled through the aperture around the pole. From this point he\r\nslid down to the short poles, and then dropped upon the ground, before\r\nthe man in the ring could pass round to the outside of the tent. Dodging\r\nunder the curtains, he reached the place which served as a\r\ndressing-room. Removing his \"trunks,\" he hurried on his clothes, and\r\nrushed out into the open air again.\r\n\r\nHis persecutors were not in sight, and he did not lose a moment in\r\nputting a safe distance between himself and them. Precisely as a\r\nwell-educated duck or other water-fowl would have done, he hastened to\r\nthe river, as his most natural element. He had made a complete circuit\r\nof the town in his flight. He did not dare to show himself to a living\r\nbeing; for it seemed to him just as though the whole country was after\r\nhim. When he reached the river, he sat down on the bank, exhausted by\r\nhis efforts and by the excitement of the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon I've got about circus enough,\" said he to himself,--for there\r\nwas no one else to whom he could say it. \"That Whippleby is worse than a\r\nheathen. I don't like any of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his legs, which were not yet done smarting; and the pain\r\nseemed to be an emphatic protest against circuses in general, and the\r\n\"Great Olympian Circus\" in particular. But whether he liked the circus\r\nor not, it was no longer safe for him to remain with the company. He had\r\ntaken \"French leave\" of the manager, and had cheated him out of the\r\ntights which enveloped his body from neck to heels. This thought\r\nreminded him that they did not feel at all comfortable, and he wished\r\nthe manager had his own again.\r\n\r\nHaving abandoned the circus profession in disgust, he wondered what he\r\nshould do next. It was useless for him to stay in the vicinity of\r\nWoodville; and the only safe plan for him to adopt was, to go away to\r\nsome other part of the country, or go to sea at once. He could not\r\ntolerate the idea of leaving without letting Bertha know where he was.\r\nThe officers were on his track, and he could not hope always to escape\r\nthem. The court-house was terrible, and prompt action was necessary.\r\n\r\nHe must have a sight of Bertha, even if he did not speak to her; and at\r\nthe risk of being captured, he determined to stay in the neighborhood of\r\nWoodville till the next morning. Near the place where he sat there was a\r\nskiff moored to the bank. He hauled it in, and took up the oars. He did\r\nnot mean to steal it, only to borrow it till the next morning. With this\r\ncomfortable reflection he cast off the painter, and pulled over to the\r\nother side of the river.\r\n\r\nIt was now quite late in the evening. He had not eaten any supper, and,\r\nlike other boys, he was always hungry at meal times. He wanted something\r\nto eat; and it occurred to him that there were generally some crackers\r\nand cheese in the locker of the Greyhound, and he rowed down to her\r\nmoorings. He found what he wanted there, and made a hearty supper. He\r\nwas satisfied then, and soon went to sleep in the stern-sheets of the\r\nsail-boat.\r\n\r\nFortunately for him he waked up about daylight, and was not seen by any\r\nof the early risers at Woodville. Appropriating the rest of the crackers\r\nand cheese for his breakfast, he got into the skiff and rowed up to the\r\nGlen, where he hoped, in the course of the forenoon, to see Bertha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nGOOD-BYE TO WOODVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBertha often walked to the Glen before breakfast, and Noddy expected to\r\nfind her there on the present occasion. As she did not appear, he\r\nfollowed the path toward Woodville, and actually reached the lawn which\r\nsurrounded the mansion before he thought of the danger he incurred. But\r\nit was breakfast time in the servants' quarters, and he was not seen.\r\n\r\nKeeping on the outskirts of the lawn, where he could make good his\r\nretreat in case of necessity, he walked nearly around to the pier, and\r\nwas so fortunate as to discover Bertha at the turn of a winding path,\r\nnear his route. The sight of her filled him with emotion, and brought to\r\nhis mind the remembrance of the many happy days he had spent in her\r\npresence. He could hardly restrain the tears which the thought of\r\nleaving the place brought to his eyes, though Noddy was not given to\r\nthe feminine custom of weeping.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Bertha,\" said he, as she approached the spot where he stood.\r\n\r\nShe started back with alarm; but he stepped forward from the concealment\r\nof the bushes, and with a smile of pleasure she recognized him.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Noddy, is that you?\" said she, walking towards the spot where he\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n\"It's me, Miss Bertha; but I suppose you don't want to see me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to see you. What did you go away for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they were going to put me in the court-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the court-house!\" exclaimed Bertha, who was better acquainted with\r\nlegal affairs than her pupil.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for setting the boat-house afire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think they intended to take you to the court-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I know they did. I have had two constables after me; but I got away\r\nfrom them. Besides, I heard Squire Wriggs say they were going to take me\r\nto the court-house. I heard him say so myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is so,\" said Bertha, musing. \"Squire Wriggs came to see\r\nfather yesterday morning. They went out together, and were speaking of\r\nyou as they left the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you didn't have anything to do with it,\" said Noddy, delighted\r\nto find that Bertha was not one of his persecutors.\r\n\r\nThen, with the utmost simplicity, and apparently with the feeling that\r\nhe was a persecuted youth, he told her everything that had occurred from\r\nthe time he first saw Mr. Grant and Squire Wriggs on the lawn.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what my father's plans are,\" said Bertha, sadly; \"but he\r\nthinks it is no longer safe to permit you to roam about the place. He is\r\nafraid you will set the house on fire, or do some other terrible thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I wouldn't, Miss Bertha,\" protested Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you do such a wicked thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you could, Noddy. That's only making a bad matter worse. Of course\r\nyou could help setting a building on fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't my fault, Miss Bertha,\" stammered he; \"I can't explain it\r\nnow--perhaps some time I may; and when you understand it, you won't\r\nthink so bad of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there is anything about it I don't know, why don't you tell me?\"\r\nadded Bertha, mystified by his strange remark.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say anything now. Please don't ask me anything about it, Miss\r\nBertha. I'm not half so much to blame as you think I am; but I set the\r\nfire, and they are after me for it. They have used all sorts of tricks\r\nto catch me; but I'm not going into any court-house, or any tinker's\r\nshop.\"\r\n\r\n\"What tricks do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"They said they had a lot of money for me, and that Squire Wriggs\r\nwouldn't do me any harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know anything about that. Father went over to Whitestone\r\nwith Squire Wriggs, after you ran away. He went over again last night,\r\nafter he came from the city, and I haven't seen him for more than a\r\nmoment since.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is going to send me to the court-house,\" said Noddy, fully satisfied\r\nthat Bertha knew nothing about the proceedings of her father. \"I am\r\ngoing to sea, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"To sea, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm going to work and win, as you told me, and when I come back I\r\nshall be respectable.\"\r\n\r\nBertha had her doubts on this point. She had almost lost all hope of her\r\n_protege_, and she did not think that a voyage in the forecastle of a\r\nship would be likely to improve his manners or his morals.\r\n\r\n\"I can't let you go, Noddy,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I must go; if I stay here they will put me in prison. You don't want to\r\nsee me put in prison, Bertha.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what can I do? The officers are after me this moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall have to tell my father that I have seen you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may do that; and you may tell him, too, that it won't be any use\r\nfor him to try to find me, for I shall keep out of the way. If they\r\ncatch me they will be smarter than I am,\" added Noddy, confidently.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see you again, Noddy, after I have talked with father about\r\nyou. I don't believe he intends to send you to prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he does. I come over here to see you before I went away. I\r\ncouldn't go without seeing you, or I shouldn't have come. I may never\r\nsee you again, for I shan't run any more risks after this.\"\r\n\r\nBertha said all she could to induce him to meet her again; but the\r\ncunning youth was afraid that some trap might be set to catch him, and\r\nhe assured her that this was positively his last appearance at Woodville\r\nfor the present. He was satisfied that Mr. Grant had taken the case into\r\nhis own hands, and that she could not save him if she would.\r\n\r\n\"Now, good-bye, Miss Bertha,\" said he, wiping a tear from his face.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, Noddy,\" pleaded she.\r\n\r\n\"I must.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't any clothes but those you have on, and you have no money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want any. I can get along very well. Won't you shake hands with\r\nme before I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I will,\" replied she, giving him her hand. \"You will not let\r\nme do anything for you now?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have done more than I deserve. Good-bye, Miss Bertha,\" said he,\r\npressing the hand he held.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Noddy,\" replied she. \"Good-bye, if you must go.\"\r\n\r\n\"There comes your father,\" exclaimed he, as he bounded off into the\r\ngrove with the speed of an antelope.\r\n\r\n\"Was that Noddy?\" asked Mr. Grant, as he joined Bertha a few minutes\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me he was here, Bertha?\"\r\n\r\n\"He came but a few moments ago. He came to bid me good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he going?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is going to sea. He says you intend to take him to the court-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is very unfortunate. A most remarkable event in regard to the boy\r\nhas occurred, which I haven't time to tell you about now. It is very\r\nimportant that I should find him at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you can catch him. He is very much afraid of being sent\r\nto prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had no intention of sending him to prison,\" laughed Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"But he heard Squire Wriggs say he must take him over to the court.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was for another matter--in a word, to have a guardian appointed,\r\nfor Noddy will be a rich man when he is of age.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noddy?\" exclaimed Bertha.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but I haven't a moment to spare. I have been at work on his\r\naffairs since yesterday morning. They are all right now; and all we want\r\nto enable us to complete the business is the presence of the boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow! He is terribly worked up at the idea of going to the\r\ncourt-house, or even to a tinker's shop, as he calls it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he is running away from his own fortune and happiness; and I must\r\nfind him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will, father,\" said Bertha, earnestly, as Mr. Grant hastened\r\naway to organize a pursuit of the refugee.\r\n\r\nAll the male servants on the place were summoned, and several started\r\noff in the direction in which Noddy had retreated. The boatman and\r\nothers were sent off in the boats; and the prospect was, that the\r\nfugitive would be captured within a few hours. As our story relates more\r\nespecially to the runaway himself, we shall follow him, and leave the\r\nwell-meaning people of Woodville to pursue their investigations alone.\r\n\r\nWhen Noddy discovered Mr. Grant, he was satisfied that the gentleman saw\r\nhim, for he quickened his pace, and walked towards the place where he\r\nstood holding Bertha's hand. He ran with all his might by the familiar\r\npaths till he reached the Glen. There were, at present, no signs of a\r\npursuit; but he was confident that it would not be delayed, and he did\r\nnot even stop to take breath. Rushing down to the water, he embarked in\r\nthe skiff, and rowed up the river, taking care to keep in shore, where\r\nhe could not be seen from below.\r\n\r\nAbove Van Alstine's Island, he crossed the river, and began to work his\r\nway down; but the white sails of the Greyhound were seen, with all the\r\nboats belonging to the estate, headed up stream. They were chasing him\r\nin earnest, and he saw that it was not safe to remain on the river.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where Mr. Grover lives?\" he asked of a ragged boy who was\r\nfishing on the bank of the river.\r\n\r\n\"Below Whitestone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you take this boat down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" replied the boy, glad of the job, and willing to do it without\r\nany compensation.\r\n\r\nNoddy had taken off the tights belonging to the circus company, and\r\nrolled them up in a bundle. In order to be as honest as Bertha had\r\ntaught him to be,--though he was not always so particular,--he engaged\r\nthe boy to leave them at the circus tent.\r\n\r\nThe boy got into the boat, and began his trip down the river. Noddy felt\r\nthat he had been honest, and he was rather proud of the record he was to\r\nleave behind him; for it did not once occur to him that borrowing the\r\nboat without leave was only a little better than stealing it, even if he\r\ndid return it.\r\n\r\nThe servants at Woodville and the constables at Whitestone were on his\r\ntrack, and he had no time to spare. Taking a road leading from the\r\nriver, he walked away from it as fast as he could. About three miles\r\ndistant, he found a road leading to the northward; and thinking it\r\nbetter to suffer by excess of prudence than by the want of it, he took\r\nthis direction, and pursued his journey till he was so tired he could go\r\nno farther.\r\n\r\nA farmer on the road gave him some dinner; and when he had rested\r\nhimself, he resumed his walk. At sunset he reached a large town on the\r\nriver, where he felt safe from pursuit until he saw the flaming\r\nhand-bills of the Great Olympian Circus, which was almost as bad as\r\nmeeting one of the constables, for these worthies would expect to find\r\nhim at the tent, and probably were on the watch for him.\r\n\r\nNoddy was too tired to walk any farther that day. He wanted to reach\r\nsome large seaport, like New York or Boston, where he could find a\r\nvessel bound on a foreign voyage. He was almost afraid to go to the\r\nformer city, for he had heard about the smart detectives they have\r\nthere, who catch any person guilty of crime, though they never saw him\r\nbefore. He had told Bertha that he intended to go to sea; and he was\r\nafraid that Mr. Grant would be on the watch for him, or set some of\r\nthese detectives to catch him, if he went there.\r\n\r\nIt was almost time for the steamers for Albany, which went up in the\r\nnight, to reach the town, and he determined to go on board of one, and\r\nproceed as far up the river as he could with the small sum of money in\r\nhis possession. He soon found the landing-place, and presently a steamer\r\ncame along.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you want to go, boy?\" asked one of the officers of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"I want to go to Albany; but I haven't money enough to pay my fare.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much money have you got?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-five cents. I will go as far as that will pay my fare.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will only be to the next landing-place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you give me some work to do, to pay my fare up to Albany?\"\r\n\r\nThe officer happened to be rather pleased with Noddy, and told him he\r\nmight stand by and help land the baggage at the stopping-places. He gave\r\nthe little wanderer some supper in the mess-room, after the boat got\r\noff, and Noddy was as grateful as though the man had given him a gold\r\nmine. When the steamer made another landing, he worked with all his\r\nmight, and was highly commended for his skill and activity.\r\n\r\nAnd so he passed the night, sleeping between the stoppages, and working\r\nlike a mule at every landing. In the morning the boat reached Albany,\r\nand the officer gave him his breakfast with the engineers. Noddy felt\r\nsafe from pursuit now; he went on shore, and walked about the city,\r\nthinking what he should do next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nAN ATTEMPT TO WORK AND WIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoston was two hundred miles distant, and Noddy was principally excited\r\nto know how he should get there, for he had decided to ship in that\r\ncity. It would take him a week to go on foot, and his funds were now\r\ncompletely exhausted, so that he could not pay his fare by railroad. If\r\nhe could neither ride nor walk, the question was narrowed down to a\r\npoint where it needed no further consideration.\r\n\r\n\"Here, boy, do you want a job?\" said a gentleman, coming out of a\r\ndwelling with a valise and a large bundle in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; thank you, sir,\" replied Noddy, springing forward, and taking\r\nthe heavier articles, without giving the gentleman the trouble to state\r\nwhat he wanted of him.\r\n\r\nThis incident seemed to solve the problem for him. He could remain in\r\nAlbany long enough to earn a sufficient sum of money to pay his fare to\r\nBoston. He followed the gentleman to the railroad station, and handed\r\nthe valise to the baggage-master. The gentleman gave him a quarter of a\r\ndollar for his services. It was a liberal return for the short time he\r\nhad been employed, and a few more such jobs as that would soon put him\r\nin funds.\r\n\r\nNoddy was sanguine now that he could earn money with entire ease, and\r\nall the difficulties which had beset him began to disappear. There was\r\nsomething exceedingly pleasant in the idea of being independent; of\r\nputting his hand into his pocket and always finding some money there\r\nwhich had been earned by his own labor. It was a novel sensation to him.\r\n\r\n\"Work and win!\" exclaimed he, as he walked out of the railroad station.\r\n\"I understand it all now, and I may thank Miss Bertha for the idea.\"\r\n\r\nIn the enthusiasm of the moment, he began to consider whether it would\r\nnot be better to remain on shore and amass a fortune, which he believed\r\ncould be done in a short time. He could carry bundles and valises till\r\nhe got money enough to buy a horse and wagon, when he could go into the\r\nbusiness on a more extensive scale. The road to fortune was open to him;\r\nall his trials and difficulties had suddenly vanished, and he had only\r\nto reach out his hand to pluck the golden harvest.\r\n\r\nThe rattling of a train which had just arrived disturbed this pleasant\r\ndream, and Noddy hastened back to secure the fruit of his brilliant\r\nresolution. There were plenty of gentlemen with bags and valises in\r\ntheir hands, but not a single one of them wanted any assistance; and\r\nsome of them answered his civil salutation with insult and harshness.\r\nThe experiment did not work so well as he had anticipated, for Noddy's\r\ngreat expectations led him to believe that he should make about half a\r\ndollar out of the arrival of this train, instead of which he did not\r\nmake a single cent.\r\n\r\n\"Work and win; but where are you going to get your work?\" said Noddy to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNo more trains were to arrive for some hours, and he posted himself in\r\nthe street, asking for a job whenever there was the least prospect of\r\nobtaining one. At noon, Noddy was hungry, and was obliged to spend half\r\nhis morning's earnings for a coarse dinner, for his circumstances did\r\nnot permit him to indulge in the luxury of roast beef and plum pudding.\r\nDuring the afternoon he lay in wait for a job at the railroad stations,\r\nand in the most public places of the city. But the sum of his earnings\r\nwas only five cents.\r\n\r\n\"Work and win!\" said he. \"Sum total of day's work, thirty cents; not\r\nenough to buy what I want to eat. It don't pay.\"\r\n\r\nIf work did not pay, stealing certainly would not; and we are happy to\r\nsay, Bertha Grant had done her duty by him so faithfully, that he did\r\nnot feel tempted to resort to any irregular means of obtaining a\r\nsubsistence. If work did not pay, it was only because he could not\r\nobtain it. He had not yet struck a productive vein. He had been a\r\nfishing a great many times; but when he had no success, he neither\r\nconcluded that fish were not good, nor that there were no fish in the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThere was a train to arrive, after dark, from New York city, and he\r\ndetermined to make one more effort to improve his fortunes. As the\r\npassengers came out of the station with small parcels of baggage in\r\ntheir hands, he offered his services to them. His heart almost leaped\r\nwith rapture when a gentleman handed him a small carpet-bag, and told\r\nhim to follow to the Delavan House. He took the bag, and then, to his\r\nhorror, he discovered that the gentleman was Mr. Grant!\r\n\r\nWhat had brought him to Albany? As Noddy's sphere of observation was\r\nconfined to the little world of his own affairs, he concluded that the\r\nowner of Woodville must be there for the purpose of arresting him.\r\nProbably some of those smart constables had traced him to the town where\r\nhe had embarked for Albany. Again the horrors of the court-house, the\r\njail, and the tinker's shop were present to his mind. He had taken the\r\nvalise, and was now following Mr. Grant to the hotel. It was dark at the\r\nplace where he had received the carpet-bag, otherwise he would have been\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nNoddy had no doubt in regard to the correctness of his conclusions; and\r\nhe could not help thinking that a great man, like Mr. Grant, was taking\r\na good deal of pains to capture a poor boy, like him. His arrest was a\r\nmatter of a great deal more consequence than he had supposed, which made\r\nit all the more necessary to his future peace and happiness that he\r\nshould escape. The bag tied him to his persecutor, or he would have run\r\naway as fast as he could. He could not carry off the baggage, for that\r\nwould subject him to another penalty, even if he had been dishonest\r\nenough to do such a thing. He decided to follow Mr. Grant to the hotel,\r\ndrop the bag, and run.\r\n\r\n\"Boy, do you know where the police office is?\" said Mr. Grant, suddenly\r\nturning round upon him.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied Noddy, whose natural boldness prompted him, when\r\nfairly cornered, to face the danger.\r\n\r\n\"What! Noddy?\" exclaimed Mr. Grant. \"I came to look for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"You were a foolish fellow to run away. I'm not going to hurt you;\r\nneither is anybody else.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was not a little astonished to find Mr. Grant, in his own homely\r\nterms, \"trying it on\" in this manner. It was not strange that the\r\nconstable, or even Squire Wriggs, should resort to deception to entrap\r\nhim; but he was not quite prepared for it from the upright proprietor of\r\nWoodville. If he was wanted \"bad enough\" to induce a gentleman of wealth\r\nand position to make a journey to Albany after him, it was the very best\r\nreason in the world why he should get out of the way as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\"How is Miss Bertha, sir?\" asked Noddy, who did not know what else to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\"She is quite well, and feels very badly now at your absence. You have\r\nmade a great mistake, Noddy,\" replied Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"Is Miss Fanny pretty well, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. We don't wish to injure you, or even to punish you, for\r\nsetting the boat-house on fire. The worst that I shall do will be to\r\nsend you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Ben any better than he was?\" continued Noddy, fully satisfied in his\r\nown mind in regard to the last remark.\r\n\r\n\"Ben is very well,\" said Mr. Grant, impatiently. \"Now, you will come\r\nwith me, Noddy, and not try to run away again.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is Mrs. Green and the rest of the folks?\" asked Noddy, fully\r\nresolved that even Mr. Grant should not \"pull wool over his eyes,\" as he\r\nquaintly expressed his view of this attempt to deceive him.\r\n\r\n\"She is well. Now come with me, Noddy. I will give you a good supper,\r\nand you shall have everything you need. Your circumstances have changed\r\nnow, and you will be a rich man when you are of age.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard from Mr. Richard lately, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind Richard, now. Come with me, Noddy. If you attempt to run\r\naway again, I shall be obliged to hand you over to a policeman.\"\r\n\r\nThat looked much more like it, in Noddy's opinion, and he had no doubt\r\nof Mr. Grant's entire sincerity in the last remark.\r\n\r\n\"I will follow you, sir,\" replied Noddy, though he did not intend to\r\ncontinue on this route much farther.\r\n\r\n\"You understand that I am your friend, Noddy, and that no harm shall\r\ncome to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; I understand that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come here now, and walk by my side. I don't want to call a policeman to\r\ntake charge of you.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy did not want him to do so either, and did not intend that he\r\nshould. He placed himself by the side of his powerful persecutor, as he\r\nstill regarded him, and they walked together towards the hotel. The\r\nyoung refugee was nervous and uneasy, and watched with the utmost\r\ndiligence for an opportunity to slip away. As they were crossing a\r\nstreet, a hack, approaching rapidly, caused Mr. Grant to quicken his\r\npace in order to avoid being run over. Noddy, burdened with the weight\r\nof the carpet-bag, did not keep up with him, and he was obliged to fall\r\nback to escape the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Here, boy, you take this bag, and follow the owner to the hotel, and he\r\nwill give you something,\" said Noddy to a ragged boy at the corner of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, he darted down the cross street, and made\r\nhis best time in the rush for liberty.\r\n\r\nThe boy, to whom Noddy had given the bag, ran over the street, and\r\nplaced himself behind Mr. Grant, whom he judged to be the owner of the\r\nbaggage.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the other boy?\" demanded Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"Gone down State Street to find ten cents he lost there,\" replied the\r\nwicked boy. \"I'll carry your bag, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want the boy! Which way did he go?\" said Mr. Grant, in hurried\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n\"Down there, sir. His mother'll lick him if he don't find the ten cents\r\nhe lost. I'll carry the bag.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Grant was unwilling to trust his property to the hands of such a\r\nboy, and he immediately reclaimed it.\r\n\r\n\"I want that boy!\" exclaimed Mr. Grant, in great agitation. \"Which way\r\ndid he go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down there,\" replied the ragged boy, pointing down a street in exactly\r\nthe opposite direction from that taken by the fugitive.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Grant was too wise a man to follow. He was in search of a\r\npoliceman just then. As these worthy functionaries are never at hand\r\nwhen they are wanted, of course he did not find one. He called a\r\ncarriage, and ordered the driver to convey him with all speed, and at\r\ndouble fare, to the police office. On his arrival, he immediately stated\r\nhis business, and in a few hours the whole police force of the city were\r\non the lookout for poor Noddy Newman.\r\n\r\nThe object of all this friendly solicitude was unconscious of the\r\ndecided steps taken by Mr. Grant; but he ran till he had placed a safe\r\ndistance between himself and his potent oppressor. He saw plenty of\r\npolicemen in his flight, but he paid no attention to them, nor even\r\nthought what a powerful combination they formed against a weak boy like\r\nhimself. He was satisfied, however, that he must leave the city; and\r\nwhen he was out of breath with running, he walked as nearly on a\r\nstraight course as the streets would permit, till he reached the\r\noutskirts of the city.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that heifer!\" shouted a man, who was chasing the animal.\r\n\r\nNoddy headed her off, and she darted away in another direction. Our\r\nrefugee was interested in the case at once; for he could not permit any\r\nhorned beast to circumvent him. He ran as though he had not run before\r\nthat evening, and brought the wayward animal up in a corner when the man\r\ncame to his assistance.\r\n\r\n\"You are a smart boy,\" said the drover.\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" puffed Noddy, modestly.\r\n\r\n\"If you haven't got nothin' better to do, I'll make it wuth your while\r\nto help drive these cattle down to the keers,\" added the man.\r\n\r\nAs Noddy had nothing better to do, he at once accepted the offer,\r\nwithout even stipulating the price. They started the heifer again, and\r\nshe concluded to join the drove which was in the adjoining street. It\r\nwas no easy matter to drive the animals, which were not accustomed to\r\nthe ways of the city, through the streets, and Noddy won a great deal of\r\ncredit for the vigor and agility with which he discharged his duty. They\r\nreached the ferry boat, and crossing, came to the \"keers,\" into which\r\nthe young drover assisted in loading the cattle.\r\n\r\nHis employer gave him a quarter of a dollar, which hardly came up to\r\nNoddy's expectations; for it seemed to him like working very hard, and\r\nwinning very little for it. The man asked him some questions about his\r\nhome. Noddy told as much of the truth as suited his purpose, and\r\nconcluded by saying he wanted to get to Boston, where he could find\r\nsomething to do.\r\n\r\n\"O, you want sunthin to do--do ye?\" replied the drover. \"Well, I'll give\r\nyou your victuals, and what clothes you want, to help me drive.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not exactly Noddy's idea of \"work and win,\" and he told the\r\ndrover he wanted to go to sea.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do. You may go down to Brighton, and help take\r\nkeer of the cattle in the keers, and I'll take keer of you on the way.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was more than satisfied with all these \"keers,\" and he promptly\r\naccepted the offer. In half an hour the train started, and he was on the\r\nway to Brighton, which is only a few miles from Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPOOR MOLLIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoddy's duty on the journey to Brighton was to assist in keeping the\r\ncattle on their feet. When the poor animals become weary, they are\r\ndisposed to lie down; but they are so closely packed that this is not\r\npossible for more than one or two in a car; and if one lies down he is\r\nliable to be trampled to death by the others. The persons in charge of\r\nthe cattle, therefore, are obliged to watch them, and keep them on their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe train occasionally stopped during the night, and was several times\r\ndelayed, so that it did not reach its destination till the middle of the\r\nfollowing forenoon. The drover provided him a hearty breakfast in the\r\nmorning, and Noddy was in no haste. The future was still nothing but a\r\nblank to him, and he was in no hurry to commence the battle of life.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at Brighton he assisted in driving the cattle to the\r\npens; and then, with half a dollar, which the drover gave him for his\r\nextra services, he started for Boston, whose spires he could even then\r\nsee in the distance. He reached the city, and from the Mill Dam--the\r\nlong bridge he had just crossed--he walked to the Common. Being quite\r\nworn out by two nights of hard work, and the long walk he had just\r\ntaken, he seated himself on one of the stone benches near the Frog Pond.\r\nIt was a warm and pleasant day, and he watched the sports of the happy\r\nchildren who were at play, until his eyelids grew heavy, and he hardly\r\nknew the State House from the Big Tree.\r\n\r\nFor a boy of his age he had undergone a severe experience. The exciting\r\ncircumstances which surrounded him had kept him wide awake until his\r\nphysical nature could endure no more. Leaving the seat he had occupied,\r\nhe sought out the quietest place he could find, and stretching himself\r\non the grass, went to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly sunset when he awoke; but he felt like a new being, ready\r\nnow to work and win at any business which might offer. He wandered about\r\nthe streets of the city for two hours, and then ate a hearty supper at a\r\nrestaurant. It was too late to do anything that night, and he asked a\r\npoliceman to tell him where he could sleep. The officer, finding he was\r\na friendless stranger, gave him a bed at the station-house.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he made his way to the wharves, and during the long day\r\nhe went from vessel to vessel in search of a berth as cabin-boy. He\r\nasked for this situation, because he had frequently heard the term; but\r\nhe was willing to accept any position he could obtain. No one wanted a\r\ncabin-boy, or so small a sailor as he was. Night came on again, with a\r\nhopeless prospect for the future; and poor Noddy began to question the\r\nwisdom of the course he had taken. A tinker's shop, with plenty to eat,\r\nand a place to sleep, was certainly much better than wandering about the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nHe could not help thinking of Woodville, and the pleasant room he had\r\noccupied in the servants' quarters; of the bountiful table at which he\r\nhad sat; and, above all, of the kindness and care which Miss Bertha had\r\nalways bestowed upon him. With all his heart he wished he was there; but\r\nwhen he thought of the court-house and the prison, he was more\r\nreconciled to his fate, and was determined to persevere in his efforts\r\nto obtain work.\r\n\r\nIt was the close of a long summer day. He had been wandering about the\r\nwharves at the north part of the city; and as the darkness came on, he\r\nwalked up Hanover Street in search of a policeman, who would give him\r\npermission to sleep another night in the station-house. As he did not\r\nreadily find one, he turned into another street. It made but little\r\ndifference to him where he went, for he had no destination, and he was\r\nas likely to find a policeman in one place as another.\r\n\r\nHe had gone but a short distance before he saw a crowd of ragged boys\r\npursuing and hooting at a drunken man who was leading a little girl ten\r\nor eleven years of age,--or rather, she was trying to lead him. Under\r\nordinary circumstances, we are afraid that Noddy would have joined the\r\nragamuffins and enjoyed the senseless sport as well as any of them; but\r\nhis own sorrows raised him above this meanness in the present instance,\r\nand he passed the boys without a particle of interest in the fun.\r\n\r\nHe was going by the drunken man and the little girl, when one of the\r\nboldest of the pursuers rushed up and gave the man a push, which caused\r\nhim to fall on the pavement. The young vagabonds raised a chorus of\r\nlaughter, and shouted with all their might. The little girl, who was\r\nevidently the drunkard's daughter, did not desert him. She bent over\r\nhim, and used all her feeble powers to assist him to his feet again.\r\n\r\n\"My poor father!\" sobbed she; and her heart seemed to be broken by the\r\ngrief and peril which surrounded her.\r\n\r\nThe tones with which these words were spoken touched the heart of Noddy;\r\nand without stopping to consider any troublesome questions, he sprang to\r\nthe assistance of the girl. The man was not utterly helpless; and with\r\nthe aid of Noddy and his daughter he got upon his feet again. At that\r\nmoment another of the unruly boys, emboldened by the feat of the first,\r\nrushed up and grasped the arm of the little girl, as if to pull her away\r\nfrom her father's support.\r\n\r\n\"Don't touch me! Don't touch me!\" pleaded the grief-stricken girl, in\r\ntones so full of sorrow that our wanderer could not resist them, if her\r\nvagabond persecutor could.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to her assistance, and with one vigorous and well-directed\r\nblow, he knocked the rude assailant halfway across the street, and left\r\nhim sprawling on the pavement. Noddy did not wait to see what the boy\r\nwould do next, but turned his attention to the poor girl, whose\r\nsituation, rather than that of her father, had awakened his sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"What is your father's name?\" asked Noddy, who proceeded as though he\r\nhad a sovereign remedy for the miseries of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Captain McClintock,\" sobbed the little girl, still clinging to her\r\nfather, with no sting of reproach in her words or her manner.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry, little girl; I will do what I can for you,\" said Noddy,\r\nwarmly. \"I can lick those boys, if I can't do anything more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" replied the afflicted daughter. \"If I can only get him down\r\nto the vessel, I shall be so glad!\"\r\n\r\n\"Want to fight?\" shouted the young ruffian, whom Noddy had upset, coming\r\nas near the party as he dared.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you fight, if you come near me again,\" replied the champion\r\nof the poor girl.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, if you want to fight,\" cried the little bully, who had not the\r\npluck to approach within twenty feet of his late assailant.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of boys still shouted, and some of them carried their\r\nhostility so far as to throw sticks and stones at the little party; but\r\nas long as they kept at a respectful distance, Noddy did not deem it\r\nwise to meddle with them, though he kept one eye on them, and stood\r\nready to punish those who ventured too near.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Captain McClintock,\" said he, as he attempted to lead the drunken\r\nfather, \"let's go on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heave ahead, my hearty!\" replied the captain, as he pressed forward,\r\nthough his steps were so uncertain that his two feeble supporters could\r\nhardly keep him on his feet.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable trio passed down Fleet Street, and, after many\r\ndifficulties and much \"rough weather,\" reached the head of the wharf,\r\nwhere the little girl said her father's vessel lay. They were still\r\nclosely followed by the merciless ragamuffins, who had pelted them with\r\nstones and sticks, until the patience of Noddy was severely tried.\r\n\r\n\"Come, my boy, now we'll--hic--now we'll go and--hic--go and take\r\nsomething 'fore we go on board,\" said the drunken captain, suddenly\r\ncoming to a dead halt in the middle of the street.\r\n\r\n\"O, no, father!\" cried the daughter; \"let us go on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something to take, Mollie, and you shall--hic--you shall have\r\nsome--hic--some soda water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want any, father. Do come on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a good girl, Mollie, and you shall--hic--you shall have some\r\ncake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to-night, father. We will get it in the morning,\" pleaded poor\r\nMollie, trembling with apprehension for the consequences which must\r\nfollow another glass of liquor.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Captain McClintock, let's go on board,\" said Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" demanded the inebriated man.\r\n\r\n\"I'm the best fellow out; and I want to see your vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see her, my boy. If you are--hic--the best fellow out, come\r\nand take something with me,\" stammered the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see the vessel first,\" replied Noddy, tugging away at the arm of\r\nthe drunken man.\r\n\r\n\"She's a very fine--hic--fine vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see her, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heave ahead, my jolly roebuck. I've got some of the best--hic--on board\r\nzever you tasted. Come along.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy and Mollie kept him going till they reached the part of the wharf\r\nwhere the captain's vessel was moored; and the end of their troubles\r\nseemed to be at hand, when the boys, aware that their sport was nearly\r\nover, became very bold and daring. They pressed forward, and began to\r\npush the drunken man, until they roused his anger to such a degree that\r\nhe positively refused to go on board till he chastised them as they\r\ndeserved. He had broken away from his feeble protectors, and in\r\nattempting to pursue them, had fallen flat upon the planks which covered\r\nthe wharf.\r\n\r\nMollie ran to his assistance; and as she did so, one of the boys pushed\r\nher over upon him. Noddy's blood was up in earnest, for the little\r\ngirl's suffering made her sacred in his eyes. He leaped upon the rude\r\nboy, bore him down, and pounded him till he yelled in mortal terror.\r\nSome of the boldest of the ragamuffins came to his relief when they\r\nrealized how hard it was going with him, and that he was in the hands of\r\nonly one small boy.\r\n\r\nNoddy was as quick as a flash in his movements, and he turned upon the\r\ncrowd, reckless of consequences. One or two of the boys showed fight;\r\nbut the young lion tipped them over before they could make up their\r\nminds how to attack him. The rest ran away. Noddy gave chase, and in\r\nhis furious wrath felt able to whip the whole of them. He pursued them\r\nonly a short distance; his sympathy for poor Mollie got the better even\r\nof his anger, and he hastened back to her side. As he turned, the\r\ncowardly boys turned also, and a storm of such missiles as the wharf\r\nafforded was hurled after him.\r\n\r\nBy this time two men from the vessel had come to the assistance of the\r\ncaptain, and raised him to his feet. He was still full of vengeance, and\r\nwanted to chastise the boys. The young ruffians followed Noddy down the\r\nwharf, and he was compelled, in self-defence, to turn upon them again,\r\nand in presence of the drunken man he punished a couple of them pretty\r\nseverely. One of the sailors came to his aid, and the foe was again\r\nvanquished. The appearance of a policeman at the head of the wharf now\r\nparalyzed their efforts, and they disbanded and scattered.\r\n\r\n\"You are a good fellow!\" exclaimed Captain McClintock, extending his\r\nhand to Noddy as he returned to the spot.\r\n\r\n\"The best fellow out,\" replied the little hero, facetiously, as he took\r\nthe offered hand.\r\n\r\n\"So you be! Now come on board, and--hic--and take something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, captain. I should like to go on board of your vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then, my jolly fellow,\" added the captain, as he reeled\r\ntowards the vessel. \"You are a smart little--hic--you are a smart little\r\nfellow. If you hadn't--hic--licked them boys, I should--hic.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy thought he did \"hic;\" but with the assistance of the sailors, the\r\ncaptain got on board, and went down into his cabin. His first movement\r\nwas to bring out a bottle of gin and a couple of glasses, into which he\r\npoured a quantity of the fiery liquor. He insisted that Noddy should\r\ndrink; but the boy had never tasted anything of the kind in his life;\r\nand from the lessons of Bertha and Ben he had acquired a certain horror\r\nof the cup, which had not been diminished by the incidents of the\r\nevening. He could not drink, and he could not refuse without making\r\ntrouble with his intoxicated host.\r\n\r\nBut Mollie saw his difficulty, and slyly substituted a glass of water\r\nfor the gin, which he drank. Captain McClintock was satisfied, and\r\novercome by his last potion, he soon sank back on the locker, and\r\ndropped asleep. With the assistance of the mate he was put into the\r\nberth in his state-room, to sleep off the effects of his debauch.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so grateful to you!\" exclaimed Mollie, when all her trials seemed\r\nto have ended.\r\n\r\n\"O, never mind me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no home?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you going to sleep to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anywhere I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you can sleep here.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was entirely willing, and one of the eight berths in the cabin was\r\nappropriated by the mate to his use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOONER ROEBUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" asked Mollie, when the arrangements for the night\r\nwere completed.\r\n\r\n\"Noddy Newman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noddy? What a queer name! That isn't your real name--is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I never knew any other.\"\r\n\r\nMollie was certainly a very pleasing young lady, and Noddy had become\r\nquite interested in her, as we always are in those to whom we are so\r\nfortunate as to render needed assistance. She had a pretty face, and her\r\ncurly hair might have challenged the envy of many a fair damsel who was\r\nwicked enough to cherish such a feeling. There was nothing rough or\r\ncoarse about her, and one would hardly have expected to find so\r\nlady-like a person in such a situation in life.\r\n\r\nWe make this statement in apology for the interest which Noddy took in\r\nthe little maiden. The service he had rendered her was quite sufficient\r\nto create a kindly feeling towards her; and then she was so pretty, so\r\nmodest, and so gentle, that his sympathy grew into admiration before she\r\nwent to her little state-room. Mollie asked him a great many questions\r\nabout his past life, and Noddy told her all he knew about himself--about\r\nBertha, Fanny, and others at Woodville. He did not tell her about the\r\naffair of the boat-house, though he determined to do so at some future\r\ntime, if he had the opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn return for all this information, Mollie told him that the schooner in\r\nwhich they then were was called the Roebuck; that she belonged to her\r\nfather, and that they were bound to the Sandwich Islands, where the\r\nvessel was to run as a packet between certain islands, whose names she\r\nhad forgotten. Captain McClintock belonged in the State of Maine, where\r\nMollie's mother had died two years before. Her father had some property,\r\nand learning that there was a good chance to improve his fortunes at the\r\nSandwich Islands, he had built the Roebuck for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAs these distant islands were to be his future home, he was to take his\r\nonly child with him, and he had fitted up a state-room in the cabin,\r\nnext to his own for her special use. Mollie told Noddy how much pleased\r\nshe was with all the arrangements, and how happy she had been on the\r\npassage to Boston, where the Roebuck was to pick up an assorted cargo\r\nfor the port of her destination. Then she wept when she thought of the\r\nterrible scenes through which she had just passed in the streets. She\r\nsaid her father did not often drink too much; that he was the very best\r\nfather in the whole world; and she hoped he never would get intoxicated\r\nagain as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nNoddy hoped so too; and when the little maiden had finished her story,\r\nhe thought she was almost equal to Miss Bertha; and he could not think\r\nof such a thing as parting with her in the morning, again to buffet the\r\nwaves of disappointment on shore.\r\n\r\n\"Does your father want a boy on board of the vessel?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Do you want to go with us?\" said Mollie, with a smile\r\nwhich spoke the pleasure the thought afforded her.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to go with you first-rate,\" replied Noddy. \"I want to do\r\nsomething, and earn some money for myself. I want to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you shall go with us!\" exclaimed Mollie. \"Out where we are going\r\nis a nice place to get rich. My father is going to get rich out there,\r\nand then we are coming home again.\"\r\n\r\nPoor child! She knew not what the future had in store for them.\r\n\r\nThe bells of the city rang for nine o'clock, and Mollie said she went to\r\nbed at this time.\r\n\r\n\"Can you read, Noddy?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, some.\"\r\n\r\n\"I always read my Testament before I go to bed; I promised my mother,\r\nyears ago, that I would; and I like to do it, too. I suppose you read\r\nyour Testament every night--don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes; that is, I did once,\" replied Noddy, in some confusion, for\r\nhe could not help recalling the teachings of Bertha on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will read it together. You would like to--wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I don't care if I do.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a want of enthusiasm on his part which was rather painful to\r\nthe little maiden; but she got the Testament, and when she had read a\r\nfew verses aloud, she passed the book to Noddy, who stumbled through his\r\nportion, and she then finished the chapter. She bade him good night, and\r\nretired to her state-room, leaving her new-made friend to meditate upon\r\nthe singular events of the evening.\r\n\r\nHe did not meditate a great while--he never did. His thoughts were\r\ndisposed to stray from one subject to another; and from the little\r\nmaiden, he found himself wondering whether Mr. Grant had finished\r\nsearching for him in Albany, and whether Miss Fanny had \"let the cat out\r\nof the bag\" yet. Noddy was too tired and sleepy to think a great while\r\nabout anything; and he turned into his berth, and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning Noddy was on his feet. He went on deck, and found\r\nthat the Roebuck was a beautiful vessel, almost handsome enough to be a\r\ngentleman's yacht. He went upon the wharf, where he could obtain a fair\r\nview of her bow, and he was sure she would make good time with a fair\r\nbreeze. When he had satisfied himself with the examination, he was more\r\nthan ever inclined to go out in her.\r\n\r\nWhen he went down into the cabin again, Mollie was there, setting the\r\ntable for breakfast. She looked as fair and as fresh as a country\r\nmaiden. She gave him a very friendly greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Do you do these things, Mollie?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"O, yes; I always work, and do what I can. I like to do something.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old are you, Mollie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eleven last May.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can't do this work when you are out at sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be seasick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never was sick, and I have been to sea a great deal with my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is the captain this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; I haven't seen him yet,\" replied she, looking very sad,\r\nas she thought of her kind father's infirmity.\r\n\r\nCaptain McClintock soon came out of his state-room. He looked pale and\r\nhaggard, and seemed to be thoroughly ashamed of himself for what he had\r\ndone the evening before, as he ought to have been. Mollie sprang to him,\r\nas he stepped out of his room, and kissed him as lovingly as though he\r\nhad never done a wrong thing in his life. He glanced at Noddy, as he\r\nentered the main cabin, and with a look of astonishment, as though his\r\nconnection with the events of the previous evening were a blank to him.\r\n\r\nThe captain did not say a word to Noddy, which made the boy feel as\r\nthough he was an intruder in the cabin; and when he had the opportunity,\r\nhe went on deck, leaving Mollie to say whatever the circumstances\r\nrequired in explanation of his presence.\r\n\r\n\"I will never do it again, Mollie,\" said the fond father, as he kissed\r\nhis daughter. \"I am very sorry, and you must forgive me, my child.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a penitent man, and felt how great was the wrong he had done the\r\npoor child. He had taken her out to walk, and to see the sights of the\r\ncity, and had become intoxicated. He remembered the whole scene, when\r\nthe boys had chased him; and to Mollie, whom he loved with all his\r\nheart, he was willing to own his fault, and to make her happy by\r\npromising never to do the wrong again.\r\n\r\nMollie then told him about her conversation with Noddy, and of the boy's\r\ndesire to go to sea with them. Captain McClintock remembered in part\r\nwhat the boy had done for them; and Mollie supplied what he had not\r\nseen, or had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes; we want a cabin-boy. I should have shipped one at home, if I\r\ncould have found the right one,\" replied the captain. \"You say he is a\r\ngood boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he is. He wants to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he know anything about a vessel? I want one who can go aloft, and\r\nshake out the top-gallant sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is used to boats and the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will see what he is good for, after breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will take him, for we have become fast friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he is good for anything, I will, Mollie. Call him down. Here comes\r\nthe doctor with the grub.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"doctor\" was the black cook of the Roebuck, who was now descending\r\nthe companion-way with the morning meal. Noddy was called, and Captain\r\nMcClintock spoke very kindly to him. He inquired particularly into his\r\nknowledge of vessels, and wanted to know whether he would be afraid to\r\ngo aloft. Noddy smiled, and thought he should not be afraid. He ate his\r\nbreakfast with a boy's appetite, and then the captain took him on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that fore-top-gallant yard?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I see it,\" replied Noddy, who had been thoroughly instructed\r\nin these matters by the old man-of-war's-man of Woodville, though he had\r\nno practical experience in seamanship, even on as large a scale as a\r\ntopsail schooner, which was the rig of the Roebuck.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my boy, that's a pretty high place. Should you dare to go up\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I should,\" answered Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see you do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I want to see what you are good for. If we can't make a sailor of\r\nyou, it won't be worth while to take you out to the Pacific. Let me see\r\nhow long it will take you to run up to that fore-top-gallant yard.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy started. Captain McClintock was evidently satisfied that it would\r\nmake the boy dizzy; and that, perhaps, if he had to do this kind of\r\nwork, he would not care to make a voyage. Mollie stood by her father's\r\nside, deeply interested in the experiment, and fearful that her heroic\r\nfriend would fail to meet her father's expectations, thus depriving her\r\nof a pleasant companion on her long voyage.\r\n\r\nThe candidate for a position on the Roebuck skipped lightly forward to\r\nthe fore-shrouds of the vessel, ran up, as chipper as a monkey, to the\r\nmast head, then up the fore-topmast rigging to the yard. Planting his\r\nfeet in the foot-ropes, he danced out to the port yard-arm. At this\r\npoint he astonished the spectators below by performing certain feats\r\nwhich he had seen at the Great Olympian Circus. Descending from the\r\nyard, he grasped the main-topmast stay, and ran over upon it to the\r\nmain-topmast, and then made his way to the deck by the main-topmast\r\nback-stay.\r\n\r\n\"You'll do, my boy!\" said the captain, emphatically. \"You will make a\r\nsmart sailor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I to go with you, sir?\" asked Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you give me?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a more difficult question; but the captain finally agreed to\r\ngive him eight dollars a month, and to advance money enough to buy him\r\nan outfit. Mollie actually danced about the deck with joy when the terms\r\nwere arranged, and it was certain that Noddy was to go on the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe boy's work had been carefully stated by the captain. He was to take\r\ncare of the cabin, wait upon the captain and his daughter at table, and\r\ndo duty forward when required. He was to have a berth in the cabin, and\r\nwas not to be in either watch, unless the vessel became short-handed.\r\n\r\n\"Now we shall be happy!\" exclaimed Mollie, who had already formed many\r\nplans for the long and lonely cruise.\r\n\r\n\"I think we shall. Do you know when we sail, Mollie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps to-day; perhaps not till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to write a letter to Miss Bertha before we go.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Noddy; never forget your friends. I will give you pen,\r\nink, and paper, by and by.\"\r\n\r\nIn the forenoon Captain McClintock took the young sailor ashore, and\r\npurchased for him a supply of clothing. Noddy always dressed like a\r\nsailor at Woodville. This was Ben's idea, and it was quite proper, as\r\nhis work was in the boats. His new garments were not strange to him,\r\ntherefore, though they were much coarser than those he wore.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the captain went on shore alone to do his business, and\r\nNoddy wrote his letter. About five o'clock he returned, and poor Mollie\r\nwas dreadfully grieved to find that he was partially intoxicated. He\r\nimmediately gave the order to get under way, and went down into the\r\ncabin, leaving the mate to haul the vessel out of the dock.\r\n\r\nNoddy made himself as useful as possible, and in a short time the\r\nRoebuck was clear of the wharf. The captain came on deck again, when\r\nthe jib was hoisted, and the sails began to draw. The voyage had\r\nactually commenced, and Noddy did not believe that Mr. Grant and the\r\nconstables would be able to catch him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE DRUNKEN CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lay aloft, and help shake out the fore-topsail,\" said the captain to\r\nNoddy, who was standing by the wheel-man, watching the movements of the\r\nvessel. \"Be lively! What are you staring at?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain's tones were stern and ugly. He had evidently taken another\r\nglass of gin since he came on board. He was sufficiently intoxicated to\r\nbe unreasonable, though he could walk straight, and understood perfectly\r\nwhat he was about. Noddy did not like the harsh tones in which the order\r\nwas given, and he did not move as lively as he would have done if the\r\nwords had been spoken pleasantly. He had not yet learned the duty of\r\nprompt obedience, be the tones what they may.\r\n\r\nHe went aloft, and helped the men who were at work on the topsail. As\r\nsoon as the sheets were hauled home, the captain hailed him from the\r\ndeck, and ordered him to shake out the fore-top-gallant sail. Noddy had\r\nmoved so leisurely before, that the command came spiced with a volley of\r\noaths; and the cabin-boy began to feel that he was getting something\r\nmore than he had bargained for. He shook out the sail, and when the yard\r\nhad been raised to its proper position, he went on deck again.\r\n\r\nThe Roebuck was dashing briskly along with a fresh southerly breeze; and\r\nif Noddy had not been troubled with a suspicion that something was\r\nwrong, he would have enjoyed the scene exceedingly. He had begun to fear\r\nthat Captain McClintock was a tyrant, and that he was doomed to undergo\r\nmany hardships before he saw his native land again.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be troubled, Noddy,\" said Mollie, in a low tone, as she placed\r\nherself by his side at the lee rail. \"My father isn't cross very often.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to be spoken to in that way,\" replied he, trying to banish\r\na certain ill feeling which was struggling for expression in his words\r\nand manner.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't mind that, Noddy. That's the way all sea captains speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed, Noddy. You must get used to it as quick as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" answered the cabin-boy; but he did not feel much like\r\ntrying; on the contrary, he was more disposed to manifest his\r\nopposition, even at the risk of a \"row,\" or even with the certain\r\nprospect of being worsted in the end.\r\n\r\nMollie, hoping that he would try, went aft again. She knew what her\r\nfather was when partially intoxicated, and she feared that one who was\r\nhigh-spirited enough to face a dozen boys of his own size and weight, as\r\nNoddy had done in the street, would not endure the harsh usage of one\r\nmade unreasonable by drinking. Some men are very cross and ugly when\r\nthey are partially intoxicated, and very silly and good-natured when\r\nthey are entirely steeped in the drunkard's cup. Such was Captain\r\nMcClintock. If he continued his potations up to a certain point, he\r\nwould pass from the crooked, cross-grained phase to that of the jolly,\r\nstupid, noisy debauchee. Entirely sober, he was entirely reasonable.\r\n\r\n\"Here, youngster!\" called the captain, as he stepped forward to the\r\nwaist, where Noddy was looking over the rail.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Noddy rather stiffly, and without turning his head.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear?\" yelled the captain, filled with passion at the contempt\r\nwith which he was treated by the boy.\r\n\r\n\"I hear,\" said Noddy, turning round as slowly as though he had a year in\r\nwhich to complete his revolution.\r\n\r\n\"Swab up that deck there; and if you don't move a little livelier than\r\nyou have yet, I'll try a rope's end to your legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't!\" retorted Noddy, sharply, for he could endure a whipping\r\nas easily as he could a threat.\r\n\r\n\"Won't I?\" cried the captain, as he seized a piece of rope from one of\r\nthe belaying pins. \"We'll see.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang upon the high-spirited boy, and began to beat him in the most\r\nunmerciful manner. Noddy attempted to get away from him, but the captain\r\nhad grasped him by the collar, and held on with an iron grip.\r\n\r\n\"Let me alone!\" roared Noddy. \"I'll knock your brains out if you don't\r\nlet me alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see!\" gasped Captain McClintock, furious with passion and with\r\ngin.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for him, he did see when it was too late; for Noddy had\r\nlaid hold of a wooden belaying pin, and aimed a blow with it at the\r\nhead of his merciless persecutor. He did not hit him on the head, but\r\nthe blow fell heavily on his shoulder, causing him to release his hold\r\nof the boy. Noddy, puffing like a grampus from the violence of the\r\nstruggle, rushed forward to the forecastle.\r\n\r\nThe captain ordered the sailors to stop him; but either because they\r\nwere not smart enough, or because they had no relish for the business,\r\nthey failed to catch him, and the culprit ran out on the bowsprit. The\r\nangry man followed him as far as the bowsprit bitts, but prudence\r\nforbade his going any farther.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, you young rascal!\" shouted the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" replied Noddy, as he perched himself on the bight of the\r\njib-stay.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, I say!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go overboard before I go any nearer to you. I'm not going to be\r\npounded for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll obey orders aboard this vessel,\" replied the captain, whose\r\npassion was somewhat moderated by the delay which kept him from his\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready to obey orders, and always have been,\" answered Noddy, who\r\nhad by this time begun to think of the consequences of his resistance.\r\n\r\n\"Will you swab up the deck, as I told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, sir; but I won't be whipped by no drunken man.\r\n\r\n\"Drunken man!\" repeated the captain. \"You shall be whipped for that, you\r\nimpudent young villain!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain mounted the heel of the bowsprit, and was making his way up\r\nto the point occupied by the refractory cabin-boy, when Mollie reached\r\nthe forecastle, and grasped her father in her little arms.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, father, don't!\" pleaded she.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, Mollie,\" said he, sternly. \"He is impudent and mutinous, and\r\nshall be brought to his senses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, father, do stop!\" cried Mollie, piteously.\r\n\r\nHe might as well stop, for by this time Noddy had mounted the jib-stay,\r\nand was halfway up to the mast head.\r\n\r\n\"He called me a drunken man, Mollie, and he shall suffer for it!\"\r\nreplied Captain McClintock, in tones so savage that the poor girl's\r\nblood was almost frozen by them.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, father!\" said she, earnestly, as he turned to move aft again.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, child.\"\r\n\r\n\"He spoke the truth,\" replied she, in a low tone, as her eyes filled\r\nwith tears, and she sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"The truth, Mollie!\" exclaimed her father, as though the words from that\r\nbeloved child had paralyzed him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father, you have been drinking again. You promised me last\r\nnight--you know what you promised me,\" said she, her utterance broken by\r\nthe violence of her emotions.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in silence for an instant; but his breast heaved under\r\nthe strong feelings which agitated him. That glance seemed to overcome\r\nhim; he dropped the rope's end, and, rushing aft, disappeared down the\r\ncompanion-way. Mollie followed him into the cabin, where she found him\r\nwith his head bent down upon the table, weeping like an infant.\r\n\r\nNoddy leisurely descended from his perch at the mast head, from which he\r\nhad witnessed this scene without hearing what was said; indeed, none of\r\nthe crew had heard Mollie's bitter words, for she had spoken them in an\r\nimpressive whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Well, youngster, you have got yourself into hot water,\" said the mate,\r\nwhen the boy reached the deck.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it,\" replied Noddy, who had begun to look doubtfully at\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't help it, you young monkey!\"\r\n\r\nNoddy was disposed at first to resent this highly improper language; but\r\none scrap at a time was quite enough, and he wisely concluded not to\r\nnotice the offensive remark.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not used to having any man speak to me in that kind of a way,\"\r\nadded Noddy, rather tamely.\r\n\r\n\"You are not in a drawing-room! Do you think the cap'n is going to take\r\nhis hat off to the cabin-boy?\" replied the mate, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't ask him to take his hat off to me. He spoke to me as if I was a\r\ndog.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way officers do speak to men, whether it is the right way or\r\nnot; and if you can't stand it, you've no business here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know they spoke in that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the fashion; and when man or boy insults an officer as you did\r\nthe captain, he always knocks him down; and serves him right too.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy regarded the mate as a very reasonable man, though he swore\r\nabominably, and did not speak in the gentlest tones to the men. He\r\nconcluded, therefore, that he had made a blunder, and he desired to get\r\nout of the scrape as fast as he could. The mate explained to him sundry\r\nthings, in the discipline of a ship, which he had not before understood.\r\nHe said that when sailors came on board of a vessel they expected more\r\nor less harsh words, and that it was highly impudent, to say the least,\r\nfor a man to retort, or even to be sulky.\r\n\r\n\"Captain McClintock is better than half of them,\" he added; \"and if the\r\nmen do their duty, they can get along very well with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he was drunk,\" said Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"That's none of your business. If he was, it was so much the more stupid\r\nin you to attempt to kick up a row with him.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy began to be of the same opinion himself; and an incipient\r\nresolution to be more careful in future was flitting through his mind,\r\nwhen he was summoned to the cabin by Mollie. He went below; the captain\r\nwas not there--he had retired to his state-room; and his daughter sat\r\nupon the locker, weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"How happy I expected to be! How unhappy I am!\" sobbed she. \"Noddy you\r\nhave made me feel very bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it; I didn't mean to make you feel bad,\" protested\r\nNoddy.\r\n\r\n\"My poor father!\" she exclaimed, as she thought again that the blame was\r\nnot the boy's alone.\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry for what I did. I never went to sea before, and I\r\ndidn't know the fashions. Where Is your father? Could I see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now; he has gone to his state-room. He will be better by and by.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to see him when he comes out. I will try and make it right with\r\nhim, for I know I was to blame,\" said Noddy, whose ideas were rapidly\r\nenlarging.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear you say so, Noddy,\" added Mollie, looking up into his\r\nface with such a sad expression that he would have done anything to\r\ncomfort her. \"Now go on deck; but promise me that you will not be\r\nimpudent to my father, whatever happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not, Mollie.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy went on deck. The Roebuck had passed out of the harbor. She was\r\nclose-hauled, and headed to the southeast. She was pitching\r\nconsiderably, which was a strange motion to the cabin-boy, whose\r\nnautical experience had been confined to the Hudson River. But there was\r\nsomething exhilarating in the scene, and if Noddy's mind had been easy,\r\nhe would have been delighted with the situation. The mate asked him some\r\nquestions about the captain, which led to a further discussion of the\r\nmatter of discipline on board a vessel.\r\n\r\n\"I want to do well, Mr. Watts,\" said Noddy. \"My best friend gave me the\r\nmotto, 'Work and Win;' and I want to do the very best I know how.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you have begun very well. If you are impudent to your\r\nofficers, I can assure you that you will work a great deal and win very\r\nlittle. Neither boy nor man can have all his own way in the world; and\r\non board ship you will have to submit to a great many little things that\r\ndon't suit you. The sooner you learn to do so with a good grace, the\r\nsooner you will be comfortable and contented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Watts, for your good advice, and I will try to follow\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" replied the mate, satisfied that Noddy was not a very\r\nbad boy, after all.\r\n\r\nNoddy was fully determined to be a good boy, to obey the officers\r\npromptly, and not to be impudent, even if they abused him. Captain\r\nMcClintock did not come on deck, or into the cabin, again that night. He\r\nhad probably drank until he was completely overcome, and the vessel was\r\nleft to the care of Mr. Watts, who was fortunately a good seaman and a\r\nskilful navigator. Noddy performed his duties, both on deck and in the\r\ncabin, with a zeal and fidelity which won the praise of the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Captain McClintock,\" said Noddy, when the master of the vessel came on\r\ndeck in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you want, youngster?\" replied the captain, in gruff and\r\nforbidding tones.\r\n\r\n\"I was wrong yesterday; I am very sorry for it, and I hope you will\r\nforgive me this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no light thing to be saucy to the captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will never do so again,\" added Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see; if you behave well, I'll pass it by, and say nothing more\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain did not speak as though he meant what he said. It was\r\nevident from his conduct during the forenoon, that he had not\r\nforgotten, if he had forgiven, Noddy's impudent speech. He addressed him\r\nrather harshly, and appeared not to like his presence.\r\n\r\nIn the forenoon the vessel passed Highland Light, and before night Noddy\r\nsaw the last of the land. There was a heavy blow in the afternoon, and\r\nthe Roebuck pitched terribly in the great seas. The cabin-boy began to\r\nexperience some new and singular sensations, and at eight bells in the\r\nevening he was so seasick that he could not hold up his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SHARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two days Noddy suffered severely from seasickness, and Mollie was\r\nfull of tenderness and sympathy. Captain McClintock still mocked the\r\npoor child's hopes, and still broke the promises which should have been\r\nsacred, for he was intoxicated each day. On the second, while Noddy was\r\nlying in his berth, the captain, rendered brutal by the last dram he had\r\ntaken, came out of his state-room, and halted near the sick boy.\r\n\r\n\"What are you in there for, you young sculpin?\" said he. \"Why are you\r\nnot on deck, attending to your duty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sick, sir,\" replied Noddy, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Sick! We don't want any skulking of that sort on board this vessel. You\r\nwant to shirk your duty. Turn out lively, and go on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is sick, father,\" said Mollie.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, Mollie. You will spoil the boy. Come, tumble out, youngster,\r\nor I shall bring down the rope's end,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\nThe daughter pleaded for her patient; but the father was ugly and\r\nunreasonable, and persisted in his purpose. Noddy did not feel able to\r\nmove. He was completely prostrated by the violence of his disagreeable\r\nmalady; and five minutes before, he would not have considered it\r\npossible for him to get out of his berth. He must do so now or be\r\nwhipped; for there was no more reason in the captain than there was in\r\nthe main-mast of the schooner. He was not able to make any resistance,\r\nif he had been so disposed.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard to be obliged to go on deck when he was sick,\r\nespecially as there was no need of his services there. He raised his\r\nhead, and sat upright in the berth. The movement seemed completely to\r\noverturn his stomach again. But what a chance this was, thought he, to\r\nshow poor Mollie that he was in earnest, and to convince her that he had\r\nreally reformed his manners. With a desperate struggle he leaped out of\r\nhis berth, and put on his jacket. The Roebuck was still pitching\r\nheavily, and it was almost impossible for him to keep on his feet. He\r\nhad hardly tasted food for two days, and was very weak from the effects\r\nof his sickness.\r\n\r\nHe crawled on deck as well as he was able, followed by Captain\r\nMcClintock, who regarded him with a look of malignant triumph. Poor\r\nNoddy felt like a martyr; but for Mollie's sake, he was determined to\r\nbear his sufferings with patience and resignation, and to obey the\r\ncaptain, even if he told him to jump overboard. He did what was almost\r\nas bad as this, for he ordered the sick boy to swab up the deck--an\r\nentirely useless operation, for the spray was breaking over the bow of\r\nthe Roebuck, and the water was rushing in torrents out of the lee\r\nscuppers. But Noddy, true to his resolution, obeyed the order, and\r\ndragged his weary body forward to perform his useless task. For half an\r\nhour he labored against nature and the elements, and of course\r\naccomplished nothing. It was all \"work\" and no \"win.\"\r\n\r\nA boy who had the resolution and courage to face a dozen angry fellows\r\nas large as himself, certainly ought not to lack the power to overcome\r\nthe single foe that beset him from within. Noddy was strong enough for\r\nthe occasion, even in his present weakly condition. It was hard work,\r\nbut the victory he won was a satisfactory reward.\r\n\r\nThe captain's vision was rather imperfect in his present state, and he\r\ntook it into his head that the foretop-gallant sail was straining the\r\ntopmast. Mr. Watts respectfully assured him the topmast was strong\r\nenough to stand the strain; but the master was set in his own opinion.\r\nApparently his view was adopted for the occasion, for he ordered Noddy\r\nto go aloft and furl the sail. Mollie protested when she heard this\r\norder, for she was afraid Noddy was so weak that he would fall from the\r\nyard. The cabin-boy, strong in the victory he had just won, did not even\r\nremonstrate against the order; but, with all the vigor he could command,\r\nhe went up the fore-rigging. He was surprised to find how much strength\r\nan earnest spirit lent to his weak body.\r\n\r\nThe pitching of the Roebuck rendered the execution of the order very\r\ndifficult to one unaccustomed to the violent motion of a vessel in a\r\nheavy sea; but in spite of all the trials which lay in his path, he\r\nfurled the sail. When he came down to the deck, the captain had gone\r\nbelow again, and the weary boy was permitted to rest from his severe\r\nlabors. Instead of being overcome by them, he actually felt better than\r\nwhen he had left his berth. The fresh air, and the conquest of the will\r\nover the feeble body, had almost wrought a miracle in his physical\r\nframe. The mate told him that what he had done was the best thing in the\r\nworld for seasickness; in fact, earnest exertion was the only remedy for\r\nthe troublesome complaint.\r\n\r\nAt supper-time Noddy took some tea and ate a couple of ship biscuits\r\nwith a good relish. He began to feel like a new person, and even to be\r\nmuch obliged to the captain for subjecting him to the tribulations which\r\nhad wrought his cure. The next morning he ate a hearty breakfast, and\r\nwent to his work with the feeling that \"oft from apparent ills our\r\nblessings rise.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain kept sober during the next five days, owing, it was believed\r\nby Noddy, to the influence of his daughter, who had the courage to speak\r\nthe truth to him. Shortly after the departure of the Roebuck, it had\r\nbeen ascertained that, from some impurity in the casks, the water on\r\nboard was not fit for use; and the captain decided to put into Barbadoes\r\nand procure a fresh supply. When the schooner took a pilot, on the\r\ntwelfth day out, it was found that the yellow fever was making terrible\r\nravages in the island; but the water was so bad on board that the\r\ncaptain decided to go into port and remain long enough to procure new\r\ncasks and a supply of water. If he had been entirely sober, he would\r\nundoubtedly have turned his bow at once from the infected island.\r\n\r\nThe Roebuck came to anchor, and the captain, regardless of his own\r\nsafety, went on shore to transact the business. The casks were\r\npurchased, but it was impossible to get them on board before the next\r\nmorning, and the vessel was compelled to remain at anchor over night.\r\nThe weather was excessively hot in the afternoon, but towards night a\r\ncool breeze came in from the sea, which was very refreshing; and Noddy\r\nand Mollie were on deck, enjoying its invigorating breath. The boat in\r\nwhich the captain had just returned lay at the accommodation ladder. The\r\nconfinement of twelve days on board the vessel had been rather irksome,\r\nand both of the young people would have been delighted to take a run on\r\nshore; but the terrible sickness there rendered such a luxury\r\nimpossible. They observed with interest everything that could be seen\r\nfrom the deck, especially the verdure-crowned hills, and the valleys\r\ngreen with the rich vegetation of the country.\r\n\r\nIf they could not go on shore, they could at least move about a little\r\nin the boat, which would be some relief from the monotony of their\r\nconfined home. They got into the boat with a warning from Mr. Watts not\r\nto go far from the schooner, and not to approach any other vessel, which\r\nmight have the yellow fever on board. Noddy sculled about on the smooth\r\nwater for a time, till it was nearly dark, and Mollie thought it was\r\ntime to return on board. As she spoke, she went forward and stood up in\r\nthe bow of the boat, ready to step upon the accommodation ladder.\r\n\r\n\"Noddy, do you see these great fishes in the water?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what they are?\" continued she, as she turned to receive the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nShe was accustomed to boats, and her familiarity with them made her as\r\nfearless as her companion.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw any like them before,\" replied Noddy, still sculling the\r\nboat towards the Roebuck.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think they are?\" added she, with one of those smiles which\r\nchildren wear when they are conscious of being wiser than their\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any idea what they are; but they look ugly enough to be\r\nsnakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen lots of them before, and I know what they are. I like you\r\nvery well, Noddy; and I ask you, as a particular favor, not to fall\r\noverboard,\" said she, with a smile, at what she regarded as a very\r\npretty joke.\r\n\r\n\"What are they, Mollie?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are sharks, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sharks!\" exclaimed the boy, who had heard Ben tell awful stories about\r\nthe voracity of these terrible creatures.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are sharks, and big ones, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Mollie. I don't like to see you stand up there. You might\r\nfall overboard,\" said Noddy, who actually shuddered as he recalled the\r\nfearful stories he had heard about these savage fish.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid. I'm just as safe here as I should be on board the\r\nRoebuck. I've seen sharks before, and got used to them. I like to watch\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the boat struck upon something in the water, which might\r\nhave been a log, or one of the ravenous monsters, whose back fins could\r\nbe seen above the water, as they lay in wait for their prey. It was some\r\nheavy body, and it instantly checked the progress of the boat, and the\r\nsudden stoppage precipitated the poor girl over the bow into the sea.\r\nNoddy's blood seemed to freeze in his veins as he realized the horrible\r\nsituation of Mollie in the water, surrounded by sharks. He expected to\r\nsee her fair form severed in twain by the fierce creatures. He could\r\nswim like a duck, and his first impulse was to leap overboard, and save\r\nthe poor girl or perish with her in the attempt.\r\n\r\nA shout from the schooner laden with the agony of mortal anguish saluted\r\nhis ears as Mollie struck the water. It was the voice of Captain\r\nMcClintock, who had come on deck, and had witnessed the fearful\r\ncatastrophe. The voice went to Noddy's soul. He saw the slight form of\r\nMollie as she rose to the surface, and began to struggle towards the\r\nboat. The cabin-boy sculled with all his might for an instant, which\r\nbrought the boat up to the spot; but he was horrified to see that she\r\nwas followed by a monstrous shark. Noddy seized the boat-hook, and\r\nsprang forward just as the greedy fish was turning over upon his side,\r\nwith open mouth, to snap up his prey.\r\n\r\nNoddy, aware that the decisive moment for action had come, and feeling,\r\nas by instinct, that a miscalculation on his part would be fatal to poor\r\nMollie, poised his weapon, and made a vigorous lunge at the savage fish.\r\nBy accident, rather than by design, the boat-hook struck the shark in\r\nthe eye; and with a fearful struggle he disappeared beneath the\r\nsurface. Grasping the extended arm of Mollie, he dragged her into the\r\nboat before another of the monsters could attack her.\r\n\r\n\"O, Noddy!\" gasped she, as she sank down upon the bottom of the boat,\r\novercome by terror, rather than by her exertions,--for she had been\r\nscarcely a moment in the water.\r\n\r\n\"You are safe now, Mollie. Don't be afraid,\" said Noddy, in soothing\r\ntones, though his own utterance was choked by the fearful emotions he\r\nhad endured.\r\n\r\n\"Our Father, who art in heaven, I thank thee that thou hast preserved my\r\nlife, and saved me from the terrible shark,\" said Mollie, as she clasped\r\nher hands and looked up to the sky.\r\n\r\nIt was a prayer from the heart, and the good Father seemed to be nearer\r\nto Noddy than ever before. He felt that some other hand than his own had\r\ndirected the weapon which had vanquished the shark.\r\n\r\n\"O, Noddy, you have saved me,\" cried Mollie, as she rose from her knees,\r\nupon which she had thrown herself before she uttered her simple but\r\ndevout prayer.\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad you are safe, Mollie! But was it me that saved you?\" asked\r\nNoddy, as he pointed up to the sky, with a sincere feeling that he had\r\nhad very little to do with her preservation, though he was so deeply\r\nimpressed by the event that he could not utter the sacred name of the\r\nPower which in that awful moment seemed to surround him, and to be in\r\nhis very heart.\r\n\r\n\"It was God who preserved me,\" said she, looking reverently upward\r\nagain; \"but he did it through you; and I may thank you, too, for what\r\nyou have done. O, Noddy, you have been my best earthly friend; for what\r\nwould my poor father have done if the shark had killed me?\"\r\n\r\nNoddy sculled towards the Roebuck, for he knew that Captain McClintock\r\nwas anxiously awaiting their return. When the boat touched the\r\naccommodation ladder, the anxious father sprang on board, not knowing\r\neven then that his daughter was entirely safe. He had seen Noddy draw\r\nher into the boat, but he feared she had lost a leg or an arm, for he\r\nwas aware that the harbor swarmed with the largest and fiercest of the\r\nmerciless \"sea-pirates.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor child!\" exclaimed he, as he clasped her in his arms, dreading\r\neven then to know the worst.\r\n\r\n\"Dear father!\" replied she.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were there any sharks out there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess there were!\" replied she, significantly.\r\n\r\n\"One of them had just heeled over to snap at her,\" added Noddy. \"I never\r\nwas so frightened in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven!\" gasped the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I gave myself up for lost,\" said Mollie, shuddering, as she recalled\r\nthat fearful moment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what prevented him from taking hold of you?\" asked Captain\r\nMcClintock, who had not been near enough to discern precisely what had\r\ntaken place in the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Noddy saved me, father. He jammed the boat-hook right into the shark's\r\nhead. In another instant the creature would have had me in his mouth. O,\r\nfather, it was such an awful death to think of--to be bitten by a\r\nshark!\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible!\" groaned the father. \"Noddy, your hand! You and I shall be\r\nfriends to the last day of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied the heroic boy, as he took the proffered hand.\r\n\"I did the best I could; but I was so scared! I was afraid the shark\r\nwould catch her in spite of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, Noddy! But come on board, and we will talk it over.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain McClintock handed Mollie, still dripping with water, to Mr.\r\nWatts, who had been an interested spectator of the touching scene in the\r\nboat; and she was borne to the cabin amid the congratulations of the\r\ncrew, with whom she was a great favorite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW FEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMollie went to her state-room, and changed her clothes; and she did not\r\ncome out till she had kneeled down and poured forth another prayer of\r\nthanksgiving for her safety from the horrible monster that would have\r\ndevoured her. Her father kissed her again, as she returned to the cabin.\r\nHe was as grateful as she was, and he took no pains to conceal the\r\nemotions which agitated him.\r\n\r\n\"Now tell me all about it, Mollie,\" said he. \"How happened you to fall\r\noverboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was careless, father. Noddy was persuading me to sit down at the\r\nmoment when I went overboard,\" replied she.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid of the sharks as soon as I knew what they were; and I was\r\nthinking what an awful thing it would be if she should fall overboard,\"\r\nadded Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"If I had minded you, Noddy, I shouldn't have been in danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe story was told by the two little adventurers, each correcting or\r\nhelping out the other, till the whole truth was obtained. It was evident\r\nto the captain and the mate, that Noddy had behaved with vigor and\r\ndecision, and that, if he had been less prompt and energetic, poor\r\nMollie must have become the victim of the ravenous shark.\r\n\r\n\"You have saved her life, Noddy; that's plain enough,\" said Captain\r\nMcClintock, as he rose and went to his state-room.\r\n\r\n\"You were smart, my boy, and you deserve a great deal of credit,\" added\r\nMr. Watts.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind that; I was too glad to get her out of the water to think\r\nof anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Noddy, you did good work that time, and you have won a great deal\r\nof honor by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall win something better than that, Noddy,\" said the captain, as\r\nhe returned to the cabin with a little bag in his hand. \"Here are ten\r\ngold pieces, my boy--one hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed Noddy the bright coins; but the little hero's face flushed,\r\nand he looked as discontented as though he had been robbed of the honor\r\nof his exploit.\r\n\r\n\"You shall win a hundred dollars by the operation,\" continued the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir, but I don't want any money for that,\" replied Noddy,\r\nwhose pride revolted at the idea, however tempting the money looked to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Take it, Noddy. You have done a good piece of work, and you ought to\r\nwin something for it,\" added the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to win any money for a job like that, Captain McClintock.\r\nI am already well paid for what I have done. I can't take any money for\r\nit. I feel too good already; and I am afraid if I take your gold I\r\nshould spoil it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are as proud as a lord, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure, if we had lost Miss Mollie, I should have missed her as much\r\nas anybody, except her father. I shouldn't feel right to be paid for\r\ndoing such a thing as knocking a shark in the head. I hated the monster\r\nbad enough to kill him, if he hadn't been going to do any mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you won't take this money, Noddy?\" continued the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather not, sir. I shouldn't feel right if I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I shouldn't feel right if you didn't. You don't quite understand\r\nthe case, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I do, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't. Let me tell you about it. You have done something which\r\nfills me with gratitude to you. I want to do something to express that\r\ngratitude. I don't know that I can do it in any other way just now than\r\nby making you a little present. I don't mean to pay you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No it don't look a bit like it. Do you think I value my daughter's life\r\nat no more than a hundred dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you do, captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I expected to pay you for what you have done, I should give you\r\nevery dollar I have in the world, and every dollar which my property\r\nwould bring if it were sold; and then I should feel that you had not\r\nhalf got your due.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care about any money, sir,\" persisted Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Let me make you a present, then. It would make me feel better to do\r\nsomething for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I would do anything to accommodate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take the money.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy took it very reluctantly, and felt just as though he was stealing\r\nit. Mr. Watts joined with the captain in arguing the matter, and he\r\nfinally felt a little better satisfied about it. When he realized that\r\nhe was the honest possessor of so large a sum, he felt like a rich man,\r\nand could not help thinking of the pleasure it would afford him to pour\r\nall these gold coins into Bertha's lap, and tell how he had won them.\r\n\r\nMollie had something to say about the matter, and of course she took her\r\nfather's side of the question; and the captain concluded the debate by\r\nassuring Noddy, if his daughter had to die, he would give more than a\r\nhundred dollars to save her from the maw of a shark, that she might die\r\nless horribly by drowning. On the whole, the cabin-boy was pretty well\r\nsatisfied that he had won the money honestly, and he carefully bestowed\r\nit with his clothing in his berth.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning Mr. Watts went on shore with a boat's crew, to\r\ncommence bringing off the water casks. It required the whole forenoon to\r\nremove the old casks, and stow the new ones in the hold. About eleven\r\no'clock the mate complained of a chilly sensation, and a pain in his\r\nback, which was followed up by a severe headache. He was soon compelled\r\nto leave his work, and take to his berth in the cabin. The next boat\r\nfrom the shore brought off a surgeon, who promptly pronounced the\r\ndisease the yellow fever.\r\n\r\nBefore the Roebuck could get off, two of the sailors were attacked by\r\nthe terrible malady. The only safety for the rest was in immediate\r\nflight; and the schooner got under way, and stood out to sea. The doctor\r\nhad left ample directions for the treatment of the disease, but the\r\nmedicines appeared to do no good. Mr. Watts was delirious before night.\r\nThe two men in the forecastle were no better, and the prospect on board\r\nthe vessel was as gloomy as it could be.\r\n\r\nMollie stood by the sufferer in the cabin, in spite of the protest of\r\nher father. She knew what the fever was; but she seemed to be endued\r\nwith a courage which was more than human. She nursed the sick man\r\ntenderly, and her simple prayer for his recovery ascended every hour\r\nduring the long night. One of the men forward died before morning, and\r\nwas committed to the deep by his terrified messmates, without even a\r\nform of prayer over his plague-stricken remains.\r\n\r\nTowards night, on the second day out of Barbadoes, Mr. Watts breathed\r\nhis last. By the light of the lanterns, his cold form was placed on a\r\nplank extended over the rail. Mollie would not permit him to be buried\r\nin his watery grave without a prayer, and Captain McClintock read one.\r\nMany tears were shed over him, as his body slid off into the sea. Noddy\r\nand Mollie wept bitterly, for they felt that they had lost a good\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThere was only one more patient on board, and he seemed to be improving;\r\nbut before the morning sun rose, red and glaring on the silent ocean,\r\nthere were three more. Captain McClintock was one of them. There was\r\nnone to take care of him but Mollie and Noddy; and both of them,\r\nregardless of the demands of their own bodies, kept vigil by his couch.\r\nMore faithful nurses a sick man never had. They applied the remedies\r\nwhich had been used before.\r\n\r\nOn the following day two more of the crew were committed to their ocean\r\ngraves, and despair reigned throughout the vessel. The captain grew\r\nworse every hour, and poor Mollie was often compelled to leave the\r\nbedside that he might not see her weeping over him. He soon became\r\ndelirious, and did not even know her.\r\n\r\n\"O, Noddy,\" exclaimed she, when she fully realized the situation of her\r\nfather, \"I shall soon be alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't give up, Mollie,\" replied the cabin-boy sadly.\r\n\r\n\"I have prayed till I fear my prayers are no longer heard,\" sobbed she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are, Mollie. Don't stop praying,\" said Noddy, who knew that\r\nthe poor girl had derived a great deal of hope and comfort from her\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\nHe had seen her kneel down when she was almost overcome by the horrors\r\nwhich surrounded them, and rise as calm and hopeful as though she had\r\nreceived a message direct from on high. Perhaps he had no real faith in\r\nher prayers, but he saw what strength she derived from them. Certainly\r\nthey had not warded off the pestilence, which was still seeking new\r\nvictims on board. But they were the life of Mollie's struggling\r\nexistence; and it was with the utmost sincerity that he had counselled\r\nher to continue them.\r\n\r\n\"My father will die!\" groaned the poor girl. \"Nothing can save him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he won't die. He isn't very bad yet, Mollie.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, he is. He does not speak to me; he does not know me.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is doing very well, Mollie. Don't give it up yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel that he will soon leave me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he won't, Mollie. I _know_ he will get well,\" said Noddy, with the\r\nmost determined emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel that he will. He isn't half so bad as Mr. Watts was. Cheer up,\r\nand he will be all right in a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"But think how terrible it would be for my poor father to die, away here\r\nin the middle of the ocean,\" continued Mollie, weeping most bitterly, as\r\nshe thought of the future.\r\n\r\n\"But he will not die; I am just as sure that he will get well, as I am\r\nthat I am alive now.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy had no reason whatever for this strong assertion, and he made it\r\nonly to comfort his friend. It was not made in vain, for the afflicted\r\ndaughter was willing to cling to any hope, however slight, and the\r\nconfident words of the boy made an impression upon her. The morrow came,\r\nand the captain was decidedly better; but from the forecastle came the\r\ngloomy report that two more of the men had been struck down by the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThere were but three seamen left who were able to do duty, and Mr.\r\nLincoln, the second mate, was nearly exhausted by watching and anxiety.\r\nFortunately, the weather had been fine, and the Roebuck had been under\r\nall sail, with a fair wind. Noddy had obtained a little sleep during the\r\nsecond night of the captain's illness, and he went on deck to report to\r\nthe mate for duty. He was competent to steer the vessel in a light\r\nbreeze, and he was permitted to relieve the man at the wheel.\r\n\r\nHe stood his trick of two hours, and then went below, to ascertain the\r\ncondition of the captain. As he descended the ladder, he discovered the\r\nform of Mollie extended on one of the lockers. Her face was flushed, and\r\nshe was breathing heavily. Noddy was appalled at this sight, for he knew\r\ntoo well what these indications meant.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Mollie?\" asked he, hardly able to speak the words\r\nfrom the violence of his emotion.\r\n\r\n\"It is my turn now, Noddy,\" replied she, in faint tones. \"Who will pray\r\nfor me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, Mollie; but what ails you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am burning up with heat, and perishing with cold. My back feels as if\r\nit was broken, and the pain darts up through my neck into my head. I\r\nknow very well what it means. You will take care of my poor\r\nfather--won't you, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I will. You must turn in, Mollie, and let me take care of\r\nyou, too,\" said he, trying to be as calm as the terrible situation\r\nrequired of him.\r\n\r\nHe assisted the stricken maiden to her state-room, and placed her in her\r\nberth. Taking from the medicine chest the now familiar remedy, he gave\r\nher the potion, and tenderly ministered to all her wants. She was very\r\nsick, for she had struggled with the destroying malady for hours before\r\nshe yielded to its insidious advances.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Noddy. I feel better now, and I shall soon be happy. Go now\r\nand see to my father; don't let him want for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not, Mollie; I will take first-rate care of him,\" answered\r\nNoddy, as he smoothed down the clothing around her neck.\r\n\r\n\"My father is the captain of the ship, you know,\" added she, with a\r\nsmile. \"He is a great man; bigger than any shark you ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nHer mind had begun to wander already; and her patient nurse could hardly\r\nkeep down his tears, as he gazed at her flushed cheeks, and smoothed\r\ndown the curls upon her neck. She was beautiful to him--too beautiful to\r\ndie there in mid ocean, with none but rude men to shed great tears over\r\nher silent form. How he wished that Bertha was there, to watch over that\r\nfrail little form, and ward off the grim tyrant that was struggling to\r\npossess it! She would not fear the pangs of the pestilence; she would be\r\nan angel in the little state-room, and bring down peace and hope, if not\r\nlife, to the lovely sufferer.\r\n\r\nNoddy felt as he had never felt before, not even when the dread monster\r\nof the deep had almost snapped up the slight form before him. All the\r\ngood lessons he had ever learned in his life came to him with a force\r\nthey had never possessed in the sunny hour of prosperity. He wanted to\r\npray. He felt the need of a strength not his own. Mollie could not pray\r\nnow. Her mind was darkened by the shadows of disease. He went out into\r\nthe cabin. It looked as cheerless, and cold, and gloomy, as the inside\r\nof a tomb. But God was there; and though Noddy could not speak the\r\nwords of his prayer, his heart breathed a spirit which the infinite\r\nFather could understand. He prayed, as he had promised the sick girl he\r\nwould, and the strength which prayer had given to her was given to him.\r\n\r\n\"Here is work for me,\" said he, as he approached the door of the\r\ncaptain's state-room. \"But I am able to do it. I will never give up this\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not know what he was to win by this work of love, amid trials and\r\ntribulation. He had struggled with the disposition to despond; he had\r\nworked like a hero to keep his spirits up; and that which he was called\r\nupon to do with his hands was small and trivial compared with that which\r\nwas done by his mind and heart. He had conquered fear and despair.\r\n\r\nThus prepared to battle with the giant ills which surrounded him, he\r\nentered Captain McClintock's room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE DEMON OF THE CUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Noddy?\" asked the captain, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. How do you feel, captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'm a little better. I wish you would ask Mollie to come in; I\r\nwant to see her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your head ache now, sir?\" asked Noddy, who did not like to tell\r\nhim that his daughter had just been taken with the fever.\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad as it did. Just speak to Mollie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are ever so much better, sir. You will be out in a day or\r\ntwo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; I'm certain you will,\" answered the boy, who knew that faith\r\nwas life in the present instance.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you think so. I certainly feel a great deal better,\" replied\r\nthe captain, as though he was already cheered by the inspiration of\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\"You must be careful, and keep still; and you will be all right in a\r\nweek, at the most.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so; for I couldn't help thinking, when I was taken down, what a\r\nbitter thing it would be to poor Mollie if I should die so far from home\r\nand friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have got over the worst of it now, captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Mollie out in the cabin?\" asked the sufferer, persistently returning\r\nto the subject near his heart.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; she is not, just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has she gone on deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she, Noddy?\" demanded he, earnestly, as he attempted to raise\r\nhimself up in his cot.\r\n\r\n\"Don't stir, captain; it will make you worse, if you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me where Mollie is at once, or I shall jump out of my berth. Is\r\nshe--is she--\"\r\n\r\n\"She is in her room, captain. Don't be worried about her,\" replied\r\nNoddy, who was afraid that the truth would have a bad effect upon the\r\ndevoted father. \"She laid down a little while ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she dead?\" gasped the captain, with a mighty effort to utter the\r\nappalling word.\r\n\r\n\"O, no, sir! She was taken sick a little while ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, mercy!\" groaned the sick man. \"I know it all now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use to deny it, sir. She has got the fever.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I lay here helpless!\"\r\n\r\n\"She said she felt a little better when I came out. I gave her the\r\nmedicine, and did everything for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will worry her to death, if you do, captain. She is more troubled\r\nabout you than she is about herself. If you lay still, so I can report\r\nthat you are doing well, it will be the best thing in the world for her.\r\nIt will do her more good than the medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her I am well, Noddy!\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't do to tell her too much; she won't believe anything, if I do,\"\r\nsaid Noddy, sorely troubled about the moral management of the cases.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her I am well, Noddy; and I will go and sit by her,\" replied the\r\nsufferer, who was no more able to get out of his bed than he was to cure\r\nthe fearful disease.\r\n\r\n\"I can't do anything, captain, if you don't keep still in your bed. She\r\nis a little out just now; but I think she will do very well, if you only\r\nlet her alone.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain McClintock was in an agony of suspense; but Noddy succeeded in\r\nconsoling him so that he promised to remain quietly in his bed. As\r\nphysician and nurse, as well as friend and comforter, the cabin-boy\r\nfound his hands full; but he had a heart big enough for the occasion;\r\nand all day and all night he went from one patient to another,\r\nministering to their wants with as much skill and judgment as though he\r\nhad been trained in a sick room.\r\n\r\nMollie grow worse as the hours wore heavily away; but this was to be\r\nexpected, and the patient nurse was not discouraged by the progressive\r\nindications of the disease. Towards morning the captain went to sleep;\r\nbut it required all the faithful boy's energies to keep Mollie in her\r\nbed, as she raved with the heated brain of the malady.\r\n\r\nIn the morning one of the seamen was reported out of danger, and the\r\nothers in a hopeful condition. Noddy was completely exhausted by his\r\nlabors and his solicitude. Mr. Lincoln saw that he could endure no more;\r\nand as he had obtained a few hours' sleep on deck during the night, he\r\ninsisted that the weary boy should have some rest, while he took care of\r\nthe sick. Noddy crawled into his berth, and not even his anxiety for\r\npoor Mollie could keep him awake any longer. He slept heavily, and the\r\nconsiderate mate did not wake him till dinner-time, when he sprang from\r\nhis berth and hastened to the couch of the sick girl.\r\n\r\nAnother day passed, and Mollie began to exhibit some hopeful symptoms.\r\nHer father was still improving. The patients in the forecastle were also\r\ngetting better. Noddy felt that no more of the Roebuck's people were to\r\nbe cast into the sea. Hope gave him new life. He was rested and\r\nrefreshed by the bright prospect quite as much as by the sleep which the\r\nkindness of Mr. Lincoln enabled him to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe schooner still sped on her course with favoring breezes; while\r\nNoddy, patient and hopeful, performed the various duties which the fell\r\ndisease imposed upon him. He had not regarded the danger of taking the\r\nfever himself. He had no thought now for any one but poor Mollie, who\r\nwas daily improving. One by one the crew, who had been stricken down\r\nwith the malady, returned to the deck; but it was a long time before\r\nthey were able to do their full measure of duty. In a week after Mollie\r\nwas taken sick, her father was able to sit a portion of the day by her\r\nside; and a few days later, she was able to sit up for a few moments.\r\n\r\nThe terrible scourge had wasted itself; but the chief mate and three of\r\nthe crew had fallen victims to the sad visitation. Yellow fever patients\r\nconvalesce very slowly; and it was a fortnight before Captain McClintock\r\nwas able to go on deck; but at the same time, Mollie, weak and\r\nattenuated by her sufferings, was helped up the ladder by her devoted\r\nfriend and nurse. The cloud had passed away from the vessel, and\r\neverybody on board was as happy as though disease and death had never\r\ninvaded those wooden walls. But the happiness was toned to the\r\ncircumstances. Hearts had been purified by suffering. Neither the\r\nofficers nor the men swore; they spoke to each other in gentle tones, as\r\nthough the tribulations through which they had passed had softened their\r\nhearts, and bound them together in a holier than earthly affection.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Watts and three sailors had died, the vessel was short-handed,\r\nbut not crippled; and the captain decided to prosecute his voyage\r\nwithout putting into any port for assistance. Mr. Lincoln was appointed\r\nchief mate, and a second mate was selected from the forecastle.\r\nEverything went along as before the storm burst upon the devoted vessel.\r\n\r\n\"How happy I am, Noddy!\" exclaimed Mollie, as they sat on deck one\r\nafternoon, when she had nearly recovered her strength. \"My father was\r\nsaved, and I am saved. How grateful I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I, Mollie,\" replied Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"And how much we both owe to you! Wasn't it strange you didn't take the\r\nfever?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you not afraid of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think anything about it, any way; but I feel just as though I\r\nhad gone through with the fever, or something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; everything looks odd and strange to me. I don't feel like\r\nthe same fellow.\"\r\n\r\nMollie persisted in her desire to know how the cabin-boy felt, and Noddy\r\nfound it exceedingly difficult to describe his feelings. Much of the\r\nreligious impressions which he had derived from the days of tribulation\r\nstill clung to him. His views of life and death had changed. Many of\r\nBertha's teachings, which he could not understand before, were very\r\nplain to him now. He did not believe it would be possible for him to do\r\nanything wrong again. Hopes and fears had been his incentives to duty\r\nbefore; principle had grown up in his soul now. The experience of years\r\nseemed to be crowded into the few short days when gloom and death\r\nreigned in the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe Roebuck sped on her way, generally favored with good weather and\r\nfair winds. She was a stanch vessel, and behaved well in the few storms\r\nshe encountered. She doubled Cape Horn without subjecting her crew to\r\nany severe hardships, and sped on her way to more genial climes. For\r\nseveral weeks after his recovery, Captain McClintock kept very steady,\r\nand Mollie hoped that the \"evil days\" had passed by. It was a vain hope;\r\nfor when the schooner entered the Pacific, his excesses were again\r\napparent. He went on from bad to worse, till he was sober hardly a\r\nsingle hour of the day. In vain did Mollie plead with him; in vain she\r\nreminded him of the time when they had both lain at death's door; in\r\nvain she assured him that she feared the bottle more than the fever. He\r\nwas infatuated by the demon of the cup, and seemed to have no moral\r\npower left.\r\n\r\nThe Roebuck was approaching the thick clusters of islands that stud the\r\nPacific; and it was important that the vessel should be skilfully\r\nnavigated. Mr. Lincoln was a good seaman, but he was not a navigator;\r\nthat is, he was not competent to find the latitude and longitude, and\r\nlay down the ship's position on the chart. The captain was seldom in\r\ncondition to make an observation, and the schooner was in peril of being\r\ndashed to pieces on the rocks. The mate was fully alive to the\r\ndifficulties of his position; and he told Mollie what must be the\r\nconsequences of her father's continued neglect. The sea in which they\r\nwere then sailing was full of islands and coral reefs. There were\r\nindications of a storm, and he could not save the vessel without knowing\r\nwhere she was.\r\n\r\n\"Noddy,\" said the troubled maiden, after Mr. Lincoln had explained the\r\nsituation to her, \"I want you to help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready,\" replied he, with his usual promptness.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to ruin. My poor father is in a terrible state, and I am\r\ngoing to do something.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall help me, but I will bear all the blame.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not do anything wrong, and I am willing to bear the blame\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that; we are going to do what's right, and we will not say a\r\nword about the blame. Now come with me,\" she continued, leading the way\r\nto the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"I am willing to do anything that is right, wherever the blame falls.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must save the vessel, for the mate says she is in great danger.\r\nThere is a storm coming, and Mr. Lincoln don't know where we are. Father\r\nhasn't taken an observation for four days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, are you going to take one?\" asked Noddy, who was rather\r\nbewildered by Mollie's statement of the perils of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\"No; but I intend that father shall to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the pantry door, and took from the shelf a bottle of gin.\r\n\r\n\"Take this, Noddy, and throw it overboard,\" said she, handing him the\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do that;\" and he went to the bull's eye, in Molli's state-room,\r\nand dropped it into the sea.\r\n\r\n\"That's only a part of the work,\" said she, as she opened one of the\r\nlockers in the cabin, which was stowed full of liquors.\r\n\r\nShe passed them out, two at a time, and Noddy dropped them all into the\r\nocean. Captain McClintock was lying in his state-room, in a helpless\r\nstate of intoxication, so that there was no fear of interruption from\r\nhim. Every bottle of wine, ale, and liquor which the cabin contained was\r\nthrown overboard. Noddy thought that the sharks, which swallow\r\neverything that falls overboard, would all get \"tight;\" but he hoped\r\nthey would break the bottles before they swallowed them. The work was\r\ndone, and everything which could intoxicate was gone; at least\r\neverything which Mollie and the cabin-boy could find. They did not tell\r\nMr. Lincoln what they had done, for they did not wish to make him a\r\nparty to the transaction.\r\n\r\nThey were satisfied with their work. The vessel would be saved if the\r\nstorm held off twelve hours longer. The captain rose early the next\r\nmorning, and Noddy, from his berth, saw him go to the pantry for his\r\nmorning dram. There was no bottle there. He went to the locker; there\r\nwas none there. He searched, without success, in all the lockers and\r\nberths of the cabin. While he was engaged in the search, Mollie, who had\r\nheard him, came out of her room.\r\n\r\nThe captain's hand shook, and his whole frame trembled from the effects\r\nof his long-inebriation. His nerves were shattered, and nothing but\r\nliquor could quiet them. Mollie could not help crying when she saw to\r\nwhat a state her father had been reduced. He was pale and haggard; and\r\nwhen he tried to raise a glass of water to his lips his trembling hand\r\nrefused its office, and he spilled it on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Where is all the liquor, Mollie?\" he asked, in shaken, hollow tones.\r\n\r\n\"I have thrown it all overboard,\" she replied, firmly.\r\n\r\nHe was too weak to be angry with her; and she proceeded to tell him what\r\nmust be the fate of the vessel, and of all on board, if he did not\r\nattend to his duty. He listened, and promised not to drink another drop;\r\nfor he knew then, even when his shattered reason held but partial sway,\r\nthat he would be the murderer of his daughter and of his crew, if the\r\nvessel was wrecked by his neglect. He meant to keep his promise; but the\r\ngnawing appetite, which he had fostered and cherished until it became a\r\ndemon, would not let him do so. In the forenoon, goaded by the insatiate\r\nthirst that beset him, he went into the hold, which could be entered\r\nfrom the cabin, and opened a case of liquors, forming part of the cargo.\r\nHe drank long and deep, and lay down upon the merchandise, that he might\r\nbe near this demon.\r\n\r\nTwelve o'clock came, and no observation could be taken. Mollie looked\r\nfor her father, and with Noddy's help she found him in the hold,\r\nsenseless in his inebriation. Mr. Lincoln was called down, and he was\r\nconveyed to his berth. The liquor was thrown overboard, but it was too\r\nlate; before dark the gale broke upon the Roebuck, and fear and\r\ntrembling were again in the vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nNIGHT AND STORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSudden and severe was the gale which came down upon the Roebuck, while\r\nher captain was besotted and helpless in his berth. Mr. Lincoln did all\r\nthat a skilful seaman could do, and while the wind and the waves were\r\nthe only perils against which the schooner had to contend, there was no\r\nserious alarm for her safety. The night had come, and the time had\r\npassed by when even Captain McClintock could do anything more than the\r\nmate.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had kept the \"dead reckoning\" as well as he could without\r\nany knowledge of the currents; and it was evident that the vessel was in\r\na perilous situation, and not far distant from the region of islands and\r\ncoral reefs. The first hours of the stormy night wore gloomily away, for\r\nnone knew at what moment the schooner might be dashed to pieces upon\r\nsome hidden rock.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain revived a little from the stupor of intoxication, he\r\nseemed not to heed the situation of the vessel. Taking the cabin\r\nlantern, he went into the hold again. His only thought seemed to be of\r\nthe liquor on which he lived. All the cases that Mollie and Noddy could\r\nfind had been thrown overboard; but the drunkard overhauled the cargo\r\ntill he found what he wanted, and taking a bottle of gin to his\r\nstate-room, he was soon as senseless as the fiery fluid could make him.\r\n\r\nMollie did all that she could do under these trying circumstances; she\r\nprayed that the good Father who had saved them before, would be with\r\nthem now; and she knew that the strong arm of Omnipotence could move far\r\nfrom them the perils with which they were surrounded. She felt better\r\nevery time she prayed. But the storm increased in fury, and she knew not\r\nthe purposes of the Infinite in regard to them.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid we shall never see the light of another day, Noddy,\" said\r\nshe, as the great seas struck with stunning force against the side of\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? We have been out in a worse gale than this,\" replied Noddy,\r\nwho felt that it was his peculiar office to keep hope alive in the\r\nheart of his gentle companion.\r\n\r\n\"But we may be in the midst of the rocks and shoals.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall do very well, Mollie. Don't give it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't give it up; but I am ready for anything. I want to be resigned\r\nto my fate whenever it comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so blue about it, Mollie. It will be all right with us in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard what Mr. Lincoln said, and you know we are in great danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know we are, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are; but for all that, the vessel will ride out the gale, and\r\nto-morrow you will laugh to think how scared you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not scared; I am ready to die. Promise me one thing, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything,\" answered he, promptly.\r\n\r\n\"You will not blame my father if the vessel is lost. He is insane; he\r\ncan't help what he does. He never did so before, and I know he don't\r\nmean to do wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he don't, and I won't blame him, whatever happens,\" replied\r\nhe, willing to comfort the poor girl in any way he could.\r\n\r\n\"I should not care so much if it didn't look as though it was all\r\nfather's fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be all right to-morrow. We will throw the rest of the liquor\r\noverboard. We will search through the hold, and not leave a single\r\nbottle of anything there. Then we shall be safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be too late then,\" sighed Mollie.\r\n\r\n\"No, it won't; the vessel will be saved. I _know_ it will,\" added Noddy,\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do; I am just as certain of it as I am of my own existence.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy had hardly uttered these confident words, before a tremendous\r\nshock threw them upon the cabin floor. It was followed by a terrible\r\ncrashing sound, as though every timber in the vessel had been rent and\r\nbroken; and they could hear the rush of waters, as the torrents poured\r\nin through the broken sides. Noddy, without stopping to think of the\r\nvain prophecy he had made, seized the light form of Mollie, and bore her\r\nto the deck. The sea was running riot there; the great waves swept over\r\nthe deck with a force which no human strength could resist, and Noddy\r\nwas compelled to retreat to the cabin again.\r\n\r\nThe lantern still swung from a deck beam, but the water had risen in the\r\ncabin so that his descent was prevented. The Roebuck had run upon a reef\r\nor shoal in such a manner that her bow was projected far out of the\r\nwater, while her stern was almost submerged in the waves. Noddy's quick\r\nperception enabled him to comprehend the position of the vessel, and he\r\nplaced his charge on the companion ladder, which was protected in a\r\nmeasure from the force of the sea by the hatch, closed on the top, and\r\nopen only on the front.\r\n\r\n\"My father!\" gasped Mollie. \"Save him, Noddy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try,\" replied Noddy. \"Hold on tight,\" added he, as a heavy\r\nvolume of water rolled down the companion-way.\r\n\r\n\"Save him, and don't mind me,\" groaned the poor girl, unselfish to the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nThe brave boy stepped down to the cabin floor, where the water was up to\r\nhis hips. Creeping on the top of the lockers, and holding on to the\r\nfront of the berths, he reached the door of the captain's state-room. In\r\nthis part of the vessel the water had risen nearly to the top of the\r\ndoor, and the berth in which the unfortunate inebriate lay was entirely\r\nbeneath its surface. He crawled into the room, and put his hand into the\r\nberth. The captain was not there.\r\n\r\nThe water was still rising, and Noddy had no doubt that the poor man had\r\nalready perished. The shock of the collision when the schooner struck,\r\nor the rising waters, had forced him from his position on the bed. The\r\nwater was over Noddy's head in the state-room; but the agony of Mollie\r\ninduced him to make a desperate effort to save her father. He dropped\r\ndown on the floor, and felt about with his feet, till he found the body.\r\nThe question was settled. Captain McClintock was dead. He was one of the\r\nfirst victims of his criminal neglect.\r\n\r\nIt was not safe to remain longer in the state-room, even if there had\r\nbeen any motive for doing so, and Noddy worked his way forward again as\r\nhe had come. He found Mollie still clinging to the ladder, suffering\r\neverything on account of her father, and nothing for herself.\r\n\r\n\"My poor father!\" said she, when she discovered her friend coming back\r\nwithout him. \"Where is he, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't do anything for him, Mollie,\" replied he.\r\n\r\n\"Is he lost?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is gone, Mollie; and it was all over with him before I got there.\r\nDon't cry. He is out of trouble now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor father,\" sobbed she. \"Couldn't you save him? Let me go and help\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"No use, Mollie,\" added Noddy, as he climbed up the ladder, and looked\r\nout through the aperture at the hatch.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure we can't do anything for him?\" she asked, in trembling\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, Mollie. He was dead when I opened the door of his room. I\r\nfound him on the floor, and had to go down over my head to find him. He\r\ndid not move or struggle, and I'm sure he is dead. I am sorry, but I\r\ncan't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, dear, dear!\" groaned she, in her anguish.\r\n\r\nShe heeded not the cracking timbers and the roaring sea. Her heart was\r\nwith the unfortunate man who lay cold and still beneath the invading\r\nwaters. She was ready to go with him to the home in the silent land.\r\n\r\n\"You hold on tight a little while, and I will go on deck, and see if I\r\ncan make out where we are,\" said Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"It matters little to me where we are. I shall soon be with my father,\"\r\nreplied Mollie.\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that. Your father is at rest now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I shall soon be at rest with him. Do you hear those terrible waves\r\nbeat against the vessel? They will break her in pieces in a few moments\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they will, and perhaps they won't. You mustn't give up, Mollie.\r\nIf I should lose you now, I shouldn't care what became of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been very good to me, Noddy; and I hope God will bless you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to save you if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot, Noddy, in this terrible storm. We are poor weak children,\r\nand we can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am bound to work and win. I shall not give it up yet, Mollie. We\r\nhave struck upon a rock or a shoal, and the land can't be a great ways\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such an awful sea! We could never reach the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can try--can't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Mr. Lincoln?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I have not heard a sound but the noise of the sea since\r\nthe vessel struck. I suppose he and the rest of the men were washed\r\noverboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"How horrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. They may have left in one of the boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any courage, Noddy. My poor father is gone, and I don't feel\r\nas though it made any difference what became of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so, Mollie. Save yourself for my sake, if you don't for your\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do?\" asked she, blankly, for the situation seemed utterly\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; I will see,\" replied Noddy, as he crawled through the\r\naperture, and reached the deck.\r\n\r\nA huge wave struck him as he rose upon his feet, and bore him down to\r\nthe lee side of the vessel; but he grasped the shrouds, and saved\r\nhimself from being hurled into the abyss of waters that boiled in the\r\nfury of the storm on both sides of the stranded schooner. He ran up the\r\nshrouds a short distance, and tried to penetrate the gloom of the night.\r\nHe could see nothing but the white froth on the waves, which beat on all\r\nsides. There was no land to be seen ahead, as he had expected, and it\r\nwas evident that the Roebuck had struck on a shoal, at some distance\r\nfrom any shore.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to walk forward on the deck, for the savage waves that\r\nbroke over the vessel would have carried him overboard. The sight\r\nsuggested the manner in which the men had so suddenly disappeared. They\r\nhad probably been swept away the moment the vessel struck. The rigging\r\nof the schooner was all standing, and Noddy decided to go forward to\r\nascertain if there was any comfortable position there for Mollie. He\r\nwent to the main-mast head, and, by the spring-stay, reached the\r\nfore-mast. Descending by the fore-shrouds, he reached the forecastle of\r\nthe schooner.\r\n\r\nThe bow had been thrown up so high on the shoal that the sea did not\r\nbreak over this part of the vessel with anything like the force it did\r\nfarther aft. The hatch was on the fore-scuttle, and it was possible that\r\nthe men had taken refuge in the forecastle. Removing the hatch, he\r\ncalled the names of Mr. Lincoln and others; but there was no response.\r\nHe then went down, and attempted to make his way aft through the hold.\r\nThis was impossible, and he was obliged to return by the way he had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\"My poor father!\" sighed Mollie, as Noddy reached the ladder to which\r\nshe was clinging; \"I shall never see you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Mollie. I want you to go with me now,\" said he, taking her by the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"Did you find any of the crew?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not a single one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor men!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid they are all drowned; but we may be saved if we only work.\r\nIf we stay here we shall certainly be lost. If the sea should carry off\r\nthe companion-hatch, we should be drowned out in spite of all we could\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must go forward.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible for me, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Save yourself, Noddy, if you can. I do not feel like doing anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall stay by you, and if you are lost I shall be lost with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will go with you, and do anything you say,\" said she, earnestly;\r\nfor when the life of another was at stake, she was willing to put forth\r\nany exertion.\r\n\r\n\"The vessel holds together first-rate, and if we stick by her till\r\nmorning, we may find some way to save ourselves. Don't give it up,\r\nMollie. Work and win; that's my motto, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready to work with you, Noddy, whether you win or not.\"\r\n\r\nThe persevering boy got a rope, which he made fast around the little\r\ngirl's body, and watching his time, at the intervals of the breaking\r\nwaves, he bore her to the main shrouds. She went up to the mast head\r\nwithout much difficulty, though the force of the wind was so great that\r\nNoddy had to hold on to her, to keep her from being blown from the\r\nropes.\r\n\r\nAt this point he made a sling for her on the spring-stay, in which she\r\nsat as a child does in a swing. It was adjusted to the big rope so that\r\nit would slip along, and permit her to hold on to the stay with her\r\nhands. The vessel seemed to be so wedged in the rocks or sand, on which\r\nshe had struck, that she did not roll, and the only obstacle to a safe\r\npassage from one mast to the other, was the violence of the gale. By\r\nNoddy's careful and skilful management, the transit was made in safety\r\nthrough the most imminent peril. The descent to the deck, forward, was\r\nmore easily accomplished, and the heroic youth soon had the pleasure of\r\nseeing his gentle charge safe, for the present, in the forecastle.\r\n\r\nHe had worked and won, so far. He was satisfied with the past, and\r\nhopeful of the future. Having conducted Mollie to a safe place, he\r\nturned his attention once more to the situation of the vessel. Looking\r\nover the bow, he discovered the dark, ragged rocks, rising a few feet\r\nabove the water, on which she had struck, but he could not see any\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE STORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roebuck had been built, under the direction of Captain McClintock,\r\nfor the voyage around Cape Horn. She was a new vessel, and of extra\r\nstrength, and she held together in spite of the hard thumping she\r\nreceived on the rocks. As she struck, a hole was knocked in her bottom;\r\nbut her bow had been forced so far up on the rocks that the water which\r\nshe made all settled aft.\r\n\r\nWith tender care Noddy had wrapped up his frail companion in a pea\r\njacket he found in the forecastle, and together they waited anxiously\r\nfor the morning light. The waves beat fiercely against the side of the\r\nvessel, pounded on the decks as they rolled over the bulwarks; and the\r\nsurvivors were in continual fear that each moment would witness the\r\ndestruction of their ark of safety. Noddy had made the best arrangements\r\nhe could for a speedy exit, in case the worst should be realized.\r\n\r\nWith the first signs of daylight Noddy was on deck endeavoring to obtain\r\na better knowledge of the location of the wreck. It seemed to him then\r\nthat the force of the gale had abated, though the sea was hardly less\r\nsavage than it had been during the night. As the day dawned, he\r\ndiscovered the outline of some dark object, apparently half a mile\r\ndistant. He watched this sombre pile till there was light enough to\r\nsatisfy him that it was an island.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Noddy,--forgetting, in the joy of this discovery, that\r\ndeath and destruction had reigned on board the Roebuck.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Mollie, hardly moved by the gladness of her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"Land ho!\" replied he, as he descended the ladder to the forecastle.\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\" said she, languidly, as though she did not feel much\r\ninterested in the announcement.\r\n\r\n\"Right over here, about half a mile off.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might as well be a thousand miles off; for we can never get there.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, we can. We have the boat on deck. I'm afraid you are\r\ndiscouraged, Mollie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help thinking of poor father,\" said she, bursting into tears\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNoddy comforted her as well as he could. He told her she ought not to\r\nrepine at the will of God, who had saved her, though he had permitted\r\nher father to be lost; that she ought to be grateful for her own\r\npreservation; and, what seemed to be the strongest argument to him, that\r\nweeping and \"taking on\" would do no good. He was but a poor comforter,\r\nand only repeated what he had often heard her say in the dark hours of\r\ntheir former tribulation. Her father was dead, and she could not help\r\nweeping. Whatever were his faults, and however great had been the error\r\nwhich had brought her to the present extremity, he was her father. In\r\nhis sober days he had loved her tenderly and devotedly; and it seemed\r\nlike sacrilege to her to dry the tears which so readily and so freely\r\nflowed. They were the natural tribute of affection from a child to a\r\nlost parent.\r\n\r\nNoddy did not dare to say all he believed, for he was convinced that the\r\ndeath of the captain was a blessing to himself and to his daughter. He\r\nwas so besotted by the demon that life could henceforth be only a misery\r\nto him, and a stumbling-block to her. It required no great faith for him\r\nto believe, in the present instance, that the good Father doeth all\r\nthings well.\r\n\r\nThe daylight came, and with it the hope of brighter hours. The clouds\r\nwere breaking away, and the winds subsided almost as suddenly as they\r\nhad risen. Still the waves broke fiercely over the wreck, and it was\r\nimpossible to take any steps towards reaching the land, whose green\r\nhills and bright valleys gladdened the heart of the storm-tossed\r\nsailor-boy. With an axe which he found in the forecastle, he knocked\r\naway a couple of the planks of the bulkhead which divided the seamen's\r\nquarters from the hold. He passed through, by moving a portion of the\r\nmiscellaneous cargo, to the cabin, where he obtained some water, some\r\nship bread, and boiled beef.\r\n\r\nPoor Mollie had no appetite; but to please her anxious friend, she ate\r\nhalf a biscuit. They passed the forenoon in the forecastle, talking of\r\nthe past and the future; but the thoughts of the bereaved daughter\r\ncontinually reverted to her father. She talked of him; of what he had\r\nbeen to her, and of the bright hopes which she had cherished of the\r\nfuture. She was positive she should never be happy again. After much\r\npersuasion, Noddy induced her to lie down in one of the bunks, and being\r\nthoroughly exhausted by anxiety and the loss of rest, she went to\r\nsleep, which gave her patient friend a great deal of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nShe slept, and Noddy went on deck again. The waves had now subsided, so\r\nthat he could go aft. He found that the jolly-boat was gone from the\r\nstern davits. At first he supposed it had been washed away by the heavy\r\nsea; but a further examination convinced him that it had been lowered by\r\nthe men. It was possible, if not probable, the crew had taken to the\r\nboat, and he might find them on the island, or a portion of them, for it\r\nwas hardly to be expected that the whole crew had escaped.\r\n\r\nFrom the deck he went below. He had anticipated that the fall of the\r\ntide would enable him to enter the state-room of the captain; but there\r\nwas no perceptible change in the height of the water. In this locality\r\nthe whole range of the tide was not more than a foot. There were many\r\nthings which might be of great value to Mollie, if they ever escaped\r\nfrom this region, and he was anxious to save them for her use. The\r\ncaptain had a considerable sum of money in gold and silver. The\r\ncabin-boy, knowing where it was, set himself at work to obtain it. He\r\nwas obliged to dive several times before he succeeded; but at last he\r\nbrought it up, and deposited it in the safest place he could find.\r\n\r\nOther articles of value were saved in the same manner, including the\r\ncaptain's chronometer and sextant, the sad neglect of which had caused\r\nthe terrible disaster. Towards night a change in the wind \"knocked down\"\r\nthe sea, and the waves no longer dashed against the shattered vessel.\r\nThe galley had been washed away; but the boat on deck, though thrown\r\nfrom the blocks, was still uninjured; and Noddy was sorely perplexed to\r\nfind a means of getting it overboard. It was too late, and he was too\r\ntired to accomplish anything that night.\r\n\r\nMollie was awake when he went to the forecastle again; and rest and\r\nrefreshment had made her more cheerful and more hopeful. She spoke with\r\ngreater interest of the future, and dwelt less mournfully on the sad\r\nevent which had made her an orphan. Noddy told her his plans for the\r\nmorrow; that he intended to launch the long-boat, and visit the island\r\nthe next day; that he would build a house for her; and that they would\r\nbe happy there till some passing whaler picked them up. The tired boy,\r\nnow secure of life, went to sleep. His fair companion wept again, as she\r\nthought of the pleasant days when her father had been a joy to every\r\nhour of her existence; but she, too, went to sleep, with none to watch\r\nover her but the good Father who had saved her in all the perils through\r\nwhich she had passed.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose clear and bright the next morning, and Noddy went on deck\r\nto prepare their simple breakfast. He had constructed a fireplace of\r\niron plates, and he boiled some water to make tea. Mollie soon joined\r\nhim; and sad as she still was, she insisted that the cooking was her\r\nduty. She performed it, while Noddy employed himself in devising some\r\nplan by which, with his feeble powers, he could hoist the heavy boat\r\ninto the water. The bulwarks had been partially stove on one side, and\r\nhe cleared away the wreck till there was nothing to obstruct the passage\r\nof the boat over the side.\r\n\r\nThey sat down on the deck to eat their breakfast; and during the meal\r\nNoddy was very quiet and thoughtful. Occasionally he cast his eyes up at\r\nthe rigging over their heads. Mollie could not help looking at him. She\r\nhad a great admiration for him; he had been so kind to her, and so brave\r\nand cheerful in the discharge of the duties which the awful catastrophe\r\nimposed upon him. Besides, he was her only friend--her only hope now.\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking about, Noddy?\" asked she, perplexed by his\r\nunusually meditative mood.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking how I should get the boat into the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't get it into the water. What can a small boy like you do with\r\na great boat like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can manage it somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't give it up, Mollie; our salvation depends on that boat. I found\r\nout something more, when I went aloft this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is another island off here to the northward, just as far as you\r\ncan see. We may wish to go there, and the boat would be wanted then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noddy, perhaps there are savages on those islands, who will kill us if\r\nwe go on shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two can play at that game,\" replied Noddy, in his confident tone.\r\n\r\n\"What could a boy like you do against a mob of Indians?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two or three pistols in the cabin, and I think I know how to\r\nuse them; at any rate I shall not be butchered, nor let you be, without\r\nshowing them what I am made of,\" answered Noddy, as he rose from the\r\nplanks, and turned his attention once more to the moving of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't shoot them--would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I could help it. I shouldn't want to shoot them; and I won't do\r\nit, if they behave themselves. But I must go to work on the boat now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me help you, Noddy, I am real strong, and I can do a great deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you when you can help me, Mollie, for I may need a little\r\nassistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you are going to do this job.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will show you in a moment,\" replied Noddy, as he ran up the main\r\nshrouds.\r\n\r\nHe carried a small hatchet in his belt, with which he detached the\r\nstarboard fore-brace from the mast. This was a rope, the end of which\r\nwas tied to the main-mast, and extended through a single sheaf-block at\r\nthe starboard fore-yard-arm. After passing through this block, the brace\r\nreturned to the main-mast, passed through another block, and led down\r\nupon the deck. There was another rope of the same kind on the port side\r\nof the vessel. They were used to swing round the yard, in order to place\r\nthe sail so that it would draw in the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen Noddy cut it loose, the brace dropped to the deck. It was now\r\nsimply a rope passing through a single block at the end of the yard. The\r\nlittle engineer made fast one end of the brace to the ring in the bow of\r\nthe boat. He then unhooked the peak halliards of the fore-sail, and\r\nattached them to the ring in the stern of the boat. Now, if he had had\r\nthe strength, he would have pulled on the yard-arm rope till he dragged\r\nthe bow out over the water; the stern line being intended merely to\r\nsteady the boat, if necessary, and keep it from jamming against the\r\nmast. When he had drawn the bow out as far as he could with the brace,\r\nhe meant to attach the same rope to the stern, and complete the job.\r\n\r\n\"That's all very pretty,\" said Mollie, who had carefully noticed all her\r\ncompanion's proceedings; \"but you and I can't hoist the boat up with\r\nthat rigging.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, Mollie,\" replied Noddy, wiping the perspiration from his\r\nbrow. \"I haven't done yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you won't make out, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall. Work and win; that's the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are working very hard, and I hope you will win.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know I made an improvement on Miss Bertha's maxim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! What?\"\r\n\r\n\"He that works shall win.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very encouraging; but it isn't always true.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is when you work in the right way,\" answered Noddy, as he took the\r\nend of the yard-arm rope, and, after passing it through a snatch-block,\r\nbegan to wind it around the barrel of the small capstan on the\r\nforecastle.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you haven't got the right way.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I haven't I shall try again, and keep trying till I do get it,\"\r\nreplied Noddy, as he handed Mollie the end of the rope which he had\r\nwound four times round the capstan. \"Do you think you can hold this\r\nrope and take in the slack?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid there will not be any to take in; but I can hold it, if\r\nthere is,\" said she, satirically, but without even a smile.\r\n\r\nNoddy inserted one of the capstan bars, and attempted to \"walk round;\"\r\nbut his feeble powers were not sufficient to move the boat a single\r\ninch. He tightened up the rope, and that was all he could accomplish.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid you could not stir it,\" said Mollie; but her tones were\r\nfull of sympathy for her companion in his disappointment.\r\n\r\nHe struggled in vain for a time; but it required a little more\r\nengineering to make the machinery move. Taking a \"gun-tackle purchase,\"\r\nor \"tackle and fall,\" as it is called on shore, he attached one hook to\r\nthe extreme end of the capstan bar, and the other to the rail. This\r\nadded power accomplished the work; and he made the capstan revolve with\r\nease, though the business went on very slowly. He was obliged to shift\r\nback the bar four times for every revolution of the barrel. But the boat\r\nmoved forward, and that was success. He persevered, and skill and labor\r\nfinally accomplished the difficult task. The boat floated in the water\r\nalongside the wreck. He had worked; he had won.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There, Mollie, what do you think now!\" exclaimed the youthful engineer,\r\nas he made fast the painter of the boat to a ring in the deck of the\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\n\"You have worked very hard, Noddy, but you have succeeded. You must be\r\nvery tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am tired, for I have done a hard day's work.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to rest now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I will. We are in no hurry, for we are very comfortable here,\r\nand storms don't come very often.\"\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when the work of getting out the boat was\r\nfinished. Noddy had labored very hard, and he was perfectly willing to\r\nrest during the remainder of the day. Mollie made some tea, and they had\r\nsupper at an early hour. It was a remarkably pleasant day, and the air\r\nwas as soft and balmy as a poet's dream. Both the young workers were\r\nvery much fatigued, and they sat upon the deck till dark.\r\n\r\n\"Where is my father now?\" asked Mollie, as she cast a nervous glance\r\ntowards the beautiful island which they hoped to reach on the following\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" repeated Noddy, surprised at the question, and not\r\nknowing what she meant.\r\n\r\n\"I mean his remains.\"\r\n\r\n\"In his state-room,\" answered Noddy, very reluctant to have the subject\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\"Will you do one thing more for me, Noddy?\" demanded she, earnestly and\r\nimpressively.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I will, Mollie.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be the last thing I shall ask you to do for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that, for I've always been ready to do everything you wished\r\nme to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you have, Noddy; and you work so hard that I don't feel like\r\nasking you to do any extra labor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do anything you wish, Mollie. You needn't be afraid to ask me,\r\neither. If you knew how much pleasure it gives me to work for you, I'm\r\nsure you would keep me busy all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to wear you out, and you may think this is useless work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I shall not, if you want it done.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you knew how sad it makes me feel to think of my poor father lying\r\nin the water there, you would understand me,\" added she, bursting into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you mean, Mollie, and it shall be done the first thing\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Noddy. You are so good and so kind! I hope I shall see Miss\r\nBertha, some time, and tell her what you have done for me,\" continued\r\nshe, wiping away her tears.\r\n\r\nThey retired to the forecastle soon after dark; and when Mollie had said\r\nher simple prayer for both of them, they lay down in the bunks, and were\r\nsoon asleep.\r\n\r\nNoddy's first work the next morning was to rig a mast and sail for the\r\nlong-boat. In this labor he was assisted by Mollie, who sewed diligently\r\non the sail all the forenoon. While she was thus engaged, Noddy, without\r\ntelling her what he was going to do, went into the cabin, carrying a\r\nboat-hook, and, with a feeling of awe amounting almost to superstitious\r\nterror, proceeded to fish up the body of Captain McClintock. He knew\r\njust where it lay, and had no difficulty in accomplishing the task. He\r\ndragged the remains out into the cabin, and floated the corpse in the\r\nwater to the foot of the ladder. It was an awful duty for him to\r\nperform; and when he saw the ghastly, bloated face, he was disposed to\r\nflee in terror from the spot.\r\n\r\nNoddy was strong for his years, or he could not have placed the body on\r\nthe locker, out of the reach of the water. He prepared the remains for\r\nburial precisely as those of Mr. Watts had been. The most difficult\r\npart of the task was yet to be performed--to get the corpse on deck, and\r\nlower it into the boat. He procured a long box in the hold, from which\r\nhe removed the merchandise, and found that it would answer the purpose\r\nof a coffin. By much hard lifting, and by resorting to various\r\nexpedients, he placed the remains in the box and nailed down the lid. He\r\nfelt easier now, for the face of the corpse no longer glared at him.\r\n\r\nWhen he had bent on the sail, and shipped the rudder, he contrived to\r\nset Mollie at work in the forecastle, where she could not see what he\r\nwas doing; for he thought his work must be revolting to her feelings,\r\nespecially as it would be very clumsily performed. Having put a sling on\r\nthe box, he rigged a purchase, and hoisted it out of the cabin. Then,\r\nwith suitable rigging, he lowered it into the boat, placing it across\r\nthe thwarts, amidships.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Mollie,\" said he, in a gentle, subdued tone, at the fore-scuttle.\r\n\r\n\"What, Noddy?\" asked she, impressed by his voice, and by his manner, as\r\nshe came up from below.\r\n\r\n\"We will go on shore now.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but we will return. The boat is ready, and I have done what you\r\nasked me to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father.\"\r\n\r\nShe was awed by his manner, and did not readily understand what he\r\nmeant. He pointed to the long box in the boat, and she comprehended the\r\nloving labor he had performed. She did not inquire how he had\r\naccomplished the task, and did not think of the difficulties which\r\nattended it. Noddy did not allude to them.\r\n\r\n\"I am ready, Noddy; but can you get me the prayer-book?\" said she, her\r\neyes filling with tears, as she prepared to perform the pious duty which\r\nthe exigencies of the occasion required of her.\r\n\r\nThe book was fortunately on a shelf to which the water had not risen,\r\nand he brought it up and gave it to her. He had before placed a pick and\r\nshovel, an axe, a couple of boards and some cords in the boat. He helped\r\nher to a seat in the stern-sheets, and shoved off. There was hardly a\r\nbreath of wind, and Noddy sculled the boat towards an opening in the\r\nreef, which was of coral, and surrounded the island. The afflicted\r\ndaughter gazed in silent grief at the box, and did not speak a word till\r\nthe boat entered a little inlet, which Noddy had chosen as a\r\nlanding-place.\r\n\r\nHe stepped on shore, and secured the boat to a bush which grew on the\r\nbank. Mollie followed him in silence, and selected a place for the\r\ngrave. It was at the foot of a cocoa palm. The spot was as beautiful as\r\nthe heart could desire for such a holy purpose; and Noddy commenced his\r\nwork. The soil was light and loose, and after much severe labor, he made\r\na grave about three feet deep. It would be impossible for him to lower\r\nthe box into the grave; and, from one end, he dug out an inclined plane,\r\ndown which he could roll the corpse to its final resting-place.\r\n\r\nIt required all his skill, strength, and ingenuity to disembark the box;\r\nbut this was finally accomplished, with such assistance as the weeping\r\ndaughter could render. The rude coffin was then moved on rollers to the\r\nfoot of the tree, and deposited in the grave. Mollie opened the book to\r\nthe funeral prayer, and handed it to her companion. Severe as the labor\r\nhe had performed had been, he regarded this as far more trying. He could\r\nnot refuse, when he saw the poor girl, weeping as though her heart would\r\nbreak, kneel down at the head of the grave. Fortunately he had read this\r\nprayer many times since it had been used at the obsequies of Mr. Watts,\r\nand it was familiar to him. Awed and impressed by the solemn task\r\nimposed upon him, he read the prayer in trembling, husky tones. But he\r\nwas more earnest and sincere than many who read the same service in\r\nChristian lands. It touched his own heart, and again the good Father\r\nseemed to be very near to him.\r\n\r\nThe reading was finished, and the loving girl, not content with what had\r\nbeen done, gathered wild flowers, rich and luxuriant in that sunny\r\nclime, and showered them, as a tribute of affection, on the rough\r\ncoffin. Noddy filled up the trench first, and then, amid the sobs of the\r\npoor child, covered all that remained of her father. With what art he\r\npossessed he arranged the green sods, as he had seen them in the\r\ngraveyard at Whitestone. Mollie covered the spot with flowers, and then\r\nseemed loath to leave the grave.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Noddy had trembled lest she should ask to look once\r\nmore on the face of the departed. He had been horrified at the sight\r\nhimself, and he knew that the distorted visage would haunt her dreams if\r\nshe was permitted to gaze upon it; but she did not ask to take that last\r\nlook. Though she said nothing about it, she seemed to feel,\r\ninstinctively, that the face was not that she had loved, which had\r\nsmiled upon her, and which was still present in her remembrance.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Mollie, it is almost dark, and we must go now,\" said he,\r\ntenderly, when he had waited some time for her.\r\n\r\n\"I am ready, Noddy; and you cannot tell how much better I feel now that\r\nmy poor father sleeps in a grave on the land--on the beautiful island!\"\r\nreplied she, as she followed him to the boat. \"You have been very kind\r\nto do what you have. It has cost you a whole day's labor.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the best day's work I have done, Mollie, if it makes you feel\r\nbetter,\" replied Noddy, as he hoisted the sail.\r\n\r\nThey did not reach the wreck till it was quite dark, for the wind was\r\nlight. Mollie was more cheerful than she had been since the vessel\r\nstruck. She had performed a religious duty, which was very consoling to\r\nher feelings in her affliction; and Noddy hoped that even her sadness\r\nwould wear away amid the active employments which would be required of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Noddy loaded the boat with provisions, and such useful\r\narticles as they would need most on the island, and in the middle of the\r\nforenoon they again sailed for the land. They entered the little inlet,\r\nand moored the boat in a convenient place, for it was decided that they\r\nshould explore the island before the goods were landed.\r\n\r\n\"We are real Robinson Crusoes now, Noddy,\" said Mollie, as they stepped\r\non shore.\r\n\r\n\"Who's he?\"\r\n\r\nShe told him who Crusoe was, and some of the main features of his\r\nresidence on the lonely island. She was surprised to learn that he had\r\nnever read the story.\r\n\r\n\"But we have everything we can possibly need, while Crusoe had scarcely\r\nanything. We have provisions enough in the vessel to last us a year,\"\r\nadded she.\r\n\r\n\"We shall do very well. I don't think we shall have to stay here long.\r\nThere are whale ships in all parts of the South Seas, and if they don't\r\ncome to us, we can go to them, for we have a first-rate boat.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked up the hill which rose from the little plain by the\r\nsea-side, where they found a small table-land. But it did not take them\r\nlong to explore the island, for it was hardly a mile in diameter.\r\nPortions of it were covered with trees, whose shape and foliage were new\r\nand strange to the visitors. No inhabitants dwelt in this little\r\nparadise; but the reason was soon apparent to Noddy; for, when Mollie\r\nwas thirsty, their search for water was unavailing. There was none on\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThis was an appalling discovery, and Noddy began to consider the\r\nsituation of the water casks on board the wreck. They returned to the\r\nboat, and having selected a suitable spot, the goods were landed, and\r\ncarefully secured under a sail-cloth brought off for the purpose. For\r\ntwo weeks Noddy labored diligently in bringing off the most serviceable\r\ngoods from the wreck. He had constructed a tent on shore, and they made\r\ntheir home on the island. For the present there was nothing but hard\r\nwork, for a storm might come and break up the schooner.\r\n\r\nNoddy rigged a series of pulleys, which enabled him to handle the water\r\ncasks with ease. Other heavy articles were managed in the same way.\r\nFarther up the inlet than his first landing-place he found a tree near\r\nthe shore, to which he attached his ropes and blocks, to hoist the\r\nbarrels out of the boat. We are sorry that our space does not permit a\r\nminute description of these contrivances, for many of them were very\r\ningenious. The labor was hard, and the progress often very slow; but\r\nNoddy enjoyed the fruit of his expedients, and was happy in each new\r\ntriumph he achieved. He had found a joy in work which did not exist in\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mollie, we must build a house,\" said he, when he had brought off\r\nsufficient supplies from the wreck.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can make a house, Noddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose you can. I think you can do anything you try to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have brought off all the boards I could get out of the wreck, and I\r\nam sure I can build a very nice house.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was immediately commenced. Near the spot selected for the\r\nmansion of the exiles there was a grove of small trees. The wood was\r\nlight and soft, and Noddy found that he could fell the trees with his\r\nsharp hatchet quickly and easily. Four posts, with a crotch in the top\r\nof each, were set in the ground, forming the corners of the house. The\r\nframe was secured with nails and with ropes. The sides and the roof were\r\nthen covered with the hibiscus from the grove. Noddy worked like a hero\r\nat his task, and Mollie watched him with the most intense interest; for\r\nhe would not permit her to perform any of the hard labor.\r\n\r\nThe frame was up, and covered, but the house was like a sieve. It was\r\nthe intention of the master builder to cover the roof with tough sods,\r\nand plaster up the crevices in the sides with mud. But Mollie thought\r\nthe fore-topsail of the schooner would be better than sods and mud,\r\nthough it was not half so romantic. They had whole casks of nails, small\r\nand large, and the sail was finally chosen, and securely nailed upon the\r\nroof and sides. A floor was made of the boards, and the house banked up\r\nso as to turn the water away from it when it rained. Two rooms, one for\r\neach of the exiles, were partitioned off with sail-cloth. A bunk was\r\nmade in each, which was supplied with a berth-sack and bed-clothes from\r\nthe schooner. Besides these two rooms, there was one apartment for\r\ngeneral purposes.\r\n\r\nThis important work occupied three weeks; but it was perfectly luxurious\r\nwhen completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE VISITORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house was finished, and the satisfaction which it afforded to the\r\nyoung exiles cannot be expressed in words. Noddy had exercised his\r\ningenuity in the construction of a fireplace, a chimney, and a table.\r\nThe stern-lights of the Roebuck furnished the windows of the principal\r\napartment; while single panes of glass, obtained from the assorted cargo\r\nof the vessel, admitted the light to the sleeping-rooms. They had\r\nknives, forks, spoons, dishes, and cooking utensils in abundance.\r\nEverything they wanted was at hand; and in this respect they differed\r\nfrom all the Crusoes of ancient and modern times.\r\n\r\nThe miscellaneous cargo of the schooner supplied the house with all the\r\ncomforts and many of the luxuries of civilization; and if Noddy had been\r\nfamiliar with the refinements of social life, he would probably have\r\nadded the \"modern improvements\" to the mansion. If the house had been an\r\nelegant residence on Fifth Avenue or Blackstone Square, the occupants\r\ncould not have enjoyed it more. Day after day Noddy added some new\r\nfeature of comfort, until he was as proud of the dwelling as though he\r\nhad been the architect of St. Peter's.\r\n\r\nThe work was done, and they had nothing to do but sit down under their\r\n\"own vine and fig-tree,\" and enjoy themselves. They had provisions and\r\nwater enough to last them six months. But Noddy had discovered that\r\nidleness was the sum of all miseries; and after he had thoroughly\r\nexplored the island, and amused himself for a few days among the\r\nnovelties of the place, he realized that work was a positive luxury.\r\nEven patient, plodding labor, without any excitement, was better than\r\ndoing nothing.\r\n\r\nThough there had been a storm, the Roebuck still held together; and the\r\nmost profitable employment that presented itself was bringing off the\r\nrest of the cargo from the wreck; and everything which it was possible\r\nfor him to move was transferred to the shore. He built a storehouse of\r\nsail-cloth, in which all the merchandise and provisions were carefully\r\nsecured, though it was not probable that any considerable portion of it\r\nwould ever be of any value to the islanders.\r\n\r\nNoddy had built a fence around the grave of Captain McClintock, and on a\r\nsmooth board had cut the name and age of the deceased. Every day Mollie\r\nvisited the spot, and placed fresh flowers on the green sod. The sharp\r\npangs of her great affliction had passed away, and she was cheerful, and\r\neven hopeful of the future, while she fondly cherished the memory of\r\nher father.\r\n\r\nThe islands which were just visible in the distance were a source of\r\ninterest and anxiety to the sailor-boy and his gentle companion. Noddy\r\nhad carefully examined them through the spy-glass a great many times;\r\nand once he had seen a large canoe, under sail, with a ponderous\r\n\"out-rigger\" to keep it from upsetting; but it did not come near the\r\nhome of the exiles. This proved that the other islands were inhabited,\r\nand he was in constant dread of a visit from the savages. He put all the\r\npistols he had found in the cabin in readiness for use, and practised\r\nfiring at a mark, that he might be able to defend himself and his fair\r\ncharge if occasion required. They did not come, and there were no signs\r\non the island that they ever visited it, and he hoped to avoid the\r\nnecessity of fighting them.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of fish in the waters which surrounded the island, and\r\nNoddy had no difficulty in catching as many of them as he wanted. There\r\nwere no animals to be seen, except a few sea-fowl. He killed one of\r\nthese, and roasted him for dinner one day; but the flesh was so strong\r\nand so fishy that salt pork and corned beef were considered better.\r\n\r\nA two months' residence on the island had accustomed both the boy and\r\nthe girl to the novelties of the situation; and though, as might be\r\nreasonably expected, they were anxious to return to the great world\r\nfrom which they had been banished, they were tolerably contented with\r\nthe life they led. Noddy was continually planning some new thing to add\r\nto the comfort of their daily life, and to provide supplies for the\r\nfuture. As in many large cities, a supply of pure water was a question,\r\nof momentous importance to him, and he early turned his attention to the\r\nsubject. He made spouts of canvas for the \"mansion\" and the storehouse,\r\nby which the water, when it rained, was conducted to barrels set in the\r\nground, so as to keep it cool. This expedient promised a plentiful\r\nsupply, for the rains were heavy and frequent, and the quality was much\r\nbetter than that of the water casks.\r\n\r\nWhen all the necessary work had been accomplished, and when the time at\r\nlast hung heavily on his hands, Noddy began to consider the\r\npracticability of a garden, to keep up the supply of peas, beans, and\r\npotatoes, of which a considerable quantity had been obtained from the\r\nwreck. Mollie was delighted with the idea of a \"farm,\" as she called it,\r\nand the ground was at once marked off. Noddy went to work; but the labor\r\nof digging up the soil, and preparing it for the seed, was very hard.\r\nThere was no excitement about this occupation, and the laborer\r\n\"punished\" himself very severely in performing it; but work had become a\r\nprinciple with him, and he persevered until an incident occurred which\r\nsuspended further operations on the garden, and gave him all the\r\nexcitement his nature craved.\r\n\r\n\"What's that, Noddy?\" said Mollie, one day, when he was industriously\r\nstriving to overcome his dislike to plodding labor.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" asked he, dropping his shovel, for the manner of his companion\r\nbetrayed no little alarm.\r\n\r\n\"On the water,\" replied she, pointing in the direction of the islands\r\nwhich had given them so much anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"It is a native canoe loaded with savages,\" said Noddy, hastening to the\r\nhouse for his spy-glass and pistols.\r\n\r\nHe examined the canoe long and attentively. It was only four or five\r\nmiles distant, and looked like quite a large boat.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming here,\" said Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"O, what shall we do?\" exclaimed the timid maiden, recalling all she\r\nknew about cannibals and fierce savages found on the South Sea Islands.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they will not come here,\" added Noddy; but it was more to cheer\r\nup his friend, than from any hope he cherished of avoiding the issue.\r\n\r\n\"I hope they will not. What do you think they will do to us, if they\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can manage them, Mollie. Don't be alarmed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many are there in the canoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"A dozen or fifteen, I should think,\" replied he, after he had again\r\nexamined the object with the glass.\r\n\r\n\"What can you do with so many as that?\" asked she, in despair.\r\n\r\n\"They are savages, you know; and they are afraid of powder. If I should\r\nshoot one of them, the rest would run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we hide?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do no good. They would certainly find us. The best way is to\r\nface the music.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they will steal all our things, Noddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't let them steal anything,\" said he, examining his pistol.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you won't have to shoot any of them. It would be awful to kill\r\nthe poor creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't fire if I can help it. They are all looking this way, and I'm\r\nsure they can see the house and the tent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" cried Mollie, who certainly felt that the end of all\r\nthings had come.\r\n\r\n\"We can do nothing; and we may as well take it easy. I can't tell what\r\nto do now; but I think I will go down and hide the boat, for they may\r\ncarry that off.\"\r\n\r\nMollie went with him to the inlet, and the boat was moved up among the\r\nbushes where the savages would not be likely to find it. The wind was\r\nlight, and the great canoe advanced but slowly. The men on board of her\r\nappeared to be watching the island with as much interest as its\r\noccupants regarded the approach of the intruders.\r\n\r\nOff the reef the big canoe came up into the wind, and the savages\r\nappeared to be debating what they should do next. They could see the\r\nremains of the wrecked schooner now; and the question appeared to be,\r\nwhether they should visit that or the shore. But she soon filled away\r\nagain, and passed through the opening in the reef. Noddy had three\r\npistols, all of which he put in his belt, and finished this hostile\r\narray by adding a huge butcher-knife to the collection. He looked\r\nformidable enough to fight a whole army; but he intended only to make a\r\nprudent display of force. Mollie thought it was rather ridiculous for a\r\nsmall boy like him to load himself down with so many weapons, which\r\ncould not avail him, if a conflict became necessary, against sixteen\r\nsavages, full grown, and accustomed to fighting. But Noddy was\r\ngeneral-in-chief of the forces, and she did not remonstrate any further\r\nthan to beg him to be prudent.\r\n\r\nThe canoe slowly approached the shore. Those in her seemed to be\r\nfamiliar with the land, for they steered directly up the little inlet\r\nwhich Noddy had chosen as his landing-place. The \"lord of the isle,\" as\r\nour sailor-boy felt himself to be, moved down to the shore, followed by\r\nMollie. The savages could now be distinctly seen. They were horribly\r\ntattooed, and they did not look very friendly. As the canoe touched the\r\nshore, they sprang to their feet, and Noddy's calculations were set at\r\nnought by the discovery that several were armed with guns.\r\n\r\nOne of them stepped on shore. There was a broad grin on his ugly face,\r\nwhich was intended for a conciliatory smile. The savage walked towards\r\nNoddy with his hand extended, and with his mouth stretched open from ear\r\nto ear, to denote the friendly nature of his mission. The boy took the\r\nhand, and tried to look as amiable as the visitor; but as his mouth was\r\nnot half so large, he probably met with only a partial success.\r\n\r\n\"Americals?\" said the savage, in tones so loud that poor Mollie was\r\nactually frightened by the sound.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a nasal voice, as a man does who has a cold in the head; but\r\nthe lord of the isle was surprised and pleased to hear even a single\r\nword of his mother tongue. He pointed impressively to the American flag,\r\nwhich had been hoisted on a pole, as he had seen Captain McClintock do\r\nwhen he had a slight difficulty with a custom-house officer at\r\nBarbadoes, and politely replied that he and Mollie were Americans.\r\n\r\n\"Big heap thigs,\" added the savage, pointing to the tent filled with\r\nstores and merchandise.\r\n\r\n\"They are mine,\" said Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Americals--yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Big wreck,\" said the visitor, pointing over to the schooner. \"Big lot\r\nmel ol the other islal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Americans?\" asked Noddy, clearly understanding the speaker, whose\r\nenunciation was principally defective in the substitution of l's for\r\nn's.\r\n\r\n\"Four Americals; big storm; come in boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that, Mollie?\" exclaimed Noddy. \"He says that four\r\nAmericans came to the other island in a boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must be some of the crew of the Roebuck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Big wreck; log time; fild it low,\" said the savage, pointing to the\r\nschooner again.\r\n\r\nThey had been looking for the wreck from which the four men had been\r\nsaved, but had not been able to find it before.\r\n\r\n\"Whale ship over there,\" added he. \"Take four mel off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she there now?\" asked Noddy, breathless with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Go sool--to-morrow--lext week.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not very definite; but the way to his native land seemed to be\r\nopen to him, and he listened with deep emotion to the welcome\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\"Can we go over there?\" asked Noddy, pointing to his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Go with we.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Big heap thigs,\" added the savage, pointing to the storehouse again.\r\n\"Walt to trade?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; what will you give for the lot?\" asked Noddy, facetiously.\r\n\r\n\"Big heap thigs,\" replied the man, not comprehending the wholesale\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIt was of no use to attempt to bargain with these people; they had no\r\nmoney, and they could help themselves to what they pleased. Noddy gave\r\nthem heavy articles enough to load their boat, for he felt that he had\r\nno further use for them, if there was a whale ship at the other island.\r\nHe questioned the savage very closely in regard to the vessel, and was\r\nsatisfied that he spoke the truth. The welcome intelligence that a\r\nportion of the Roebuck's crew had been saved, rendered the exiles the\r\nmore anxious to visit the island.\r\n\r\nThe savages all landed and gazed at Mollie with the utmost interest and\r\ncuriosity. Probably they had never before seen an American girl. But\r\nthey were respectful to her, and she soon ceased to be afraid of them.\r\nShe laughed with them, and soon became quite intimate with the whole\r\nparty. They treated her like a superior being; and certainly her pretty\r\nface and her gentle manners were quite enough to inspire them with such\r\nan idea.\r\n\r\nThe savages had loaded their goods into the canoe, and were ready to\r\nreturn. The man who spoke English offered them a passage in his craft;\r\nbut Noddy decided that it would be better and safer for them to go over\r\nin their own boat. He proceeded to secure all his valuables, including\r\nall his own money and that he had saved from the state-room of the\r\ncaptain, which he concealed about his clothes. The boat was well loaded\r\nwith such articles as he thought would be useful to Mollie, or would\r\nsell best when a chance offered. He had quite a cargo, and the savages\r\nbegan to be impatient before his preparations were completed.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus employed, Mollie gathered fresh flowers, and paid her\r\nlast visit, as she supposed, to the grave of her father. She wept there,\r\nas she thought of leaving him in that far-off, lonely island; but she\r\nwas consoled by the belief that her father's spirit dwelt in the happy\r\nland, where spring eternal ever reigns.\r\n\r\nThe boat was ready; she wiped away her tears, and stepped on board. Both\r\nof them felt sad at the thought of leaving the island; but home had\r\nhopes which reconciled them to the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nHOMEWARD BOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoddy shook out the sail of the boat, and pushing her off, followed the\r\ncanoe. Though the exiles had been on the island but little over two\r\nmonths, they had become much attached to their new home, and it was with\r\na feeling of sadness that they bade adieu to it. The house and other\r\nimprovements had cost Noddy so much hard labor that he was sorry to\r\nleave them before he had received the full benefit of all the comfort\r\nand luxury which they were capable of affording.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think we ought to live on the island for a year or so, after\r\nall the work we have done there?\" said Noddy, as the boat gathered\r\nheadway, and moved away from the shore.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I should be very happy there, if we had to stay,\" replied\r\nMollie, \"But I don't think I should care to remain just for the sake of\r\nliving in the house you built.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I; but it seems to me just as though I had done all the work for\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You worked very hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I enjoyed my work, for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think you did not win anything by it,\" added she, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that. I used to hate to work when I was at Woodville. I\r\ndon't think I do hate it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have won something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have won a great deal, when I look the matter over. I have\r\nlearned a great many things.\"\r\n\r\nNoddy had only a partial appreciation of what he had \"won,\" though he\r\nwas satisfied that his labor had not been wasted. He had been happy in\r\nthe occupation which the necessities of his situation demanded of him.\r\nMany a boy, wrecked as he had been, with no one but a weak and timid\r\ngirl to support him, would have done nothing but repine at his hard lot;\r\nwould have lived \"from hand to mouth\" during those two months, and made\r\nevery day a day of misery. Noddy had worked hard; but what had he won?\r\nWas his labor, now that he was to abandon the house, the cisterns, the\r\nstores, and the garden,--was it wasted?\r\n\r\nNoddy had won two months of happiness.\r\n\r\nHe had won a knowledge of his own powers, mental and physical.\r\n\r\nHe had won a valuable experience in adapting means to ends, which others\r\nmight be years in obtaining.\r\n\r\nHe had won a vast amount of useful information from the stubborn toil he\r\nhad performed.\r\n\r\nHe had won the victory over idleness and indifference, which had beset\r\nhim for years.\r\n\r\nHe had won a cheerful spirit, from the trials and difficulties he had\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nHe had won a lively faith in things higher than earth, from the gentle\r\nand loving heart that shared his exile, for whom, rather than for\r\nhimself, he had worked.\r\n\r\nHis labor was not lost. He had won more than could be computed. He had\r\nwon faith and hope, confidence in himself, an earnest purpose, which\r\nwere to go through life with him, and bless him to the end of his days,\r\nand through the endless ages of eternity. He had worked earnestly; he\r\nhad won untold riches.\r\n\r\nThe wind was tolerably fresh after the boats passed the reef, and in two\r\nhours they were near enough to a large island to enable the young\r\nvoyagers to see the objects on the shore. But they followed the canoe\r\nbeyond a point of the land; and, after a run of several miles more, they\r\nrounded another point, and discovered the tall masts of a ship, at\r\nanchor in a small bay.\r\n\r\n\"It may be many months before we can get home. This ship may have to\r\ncruise a year or two before she obtains her full cargo of oil.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we may find some way to get home. I have all the money I saved from\r\nthe vessel, and we can pay our passage home.\"\r\n\r\nThe money reminded the orphan girl of her father, and she mused upon the\r\npast. The boat sped on its way, and in a short time reached the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Noddy!\" shouted Mr. Lincoln, as the boat approached. \"And Mollie\r\ntoo!\"\r\n\r\nThe mate was overjoyed to see them, and to find that they had been saved\r\nfrom the wreck. He leaped into the boat, took Mollie in his arms, and\r\nkissed her as though she had been his own child. He grasped the hand of\r\nNoddy, and wrung it till the owner thought it would be crushed in his\r\ngrip.\r\n\r\n\"I was sure you were lost,\" said Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\"And we were sure you were lost,\" replied Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen? The cabin was full of water when we left the\r\nschooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't wait long, Mr. Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't wait long. The sea made a clean breach over the wreck. Only\r\nfour of us were saved; the rest were washed away, and we never saw\r\nanything more of them!\"\r\n\r\nNoddy and Mollie were conducted to the deck of the whale ship, where\r\nthey were warmly welcomed by the captain and his officers. The three\r\nsailors who had been saved from the wreck of the Roebuck were rejoiced\r\nto see them alive and well. In the presence of the large group gathered\r\naround himself and Mollie, Noddy told his story.\r\n\r\n\"Captain McClintock was lost, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Noddy, breaking through the crowd, for he did not like to\r\ntell the particulars of his death in poor Mollie's presence.\r\n\r\nAt a later hour he found an opportunity to inform his late shipmates of\r\nthe manner in which the corpse of the captain had been found, and of its\r\nburial on the island. In return, Mr. Lincoln told him that he had cast\r\noff the boat a moment after the schooner struck the reef. The men who\r\nhappened to be on the quarter-deck with him had been saved; the others\r\nwere not seen after the shock. With the greatest difficulty they had\r\nkept the boat right side up, for she was often full of water. For hours\r\nthey had drifted in the gale, and in the morning, when the storm\r\nsubsided, they had reached the island.\r\n\r\nThey had been kindly treated by natives, who were partially civilized by\r\ntheir intercourse with vessels visiting the island, and with which they\r\ncarried on commerce, exchanging the products of the island for guns,\r\nammunition, and other useful and ornamental articles. The savages knew\r\nthat, if they killed or injured any white men, the terrible ships of war\r\nwould visit them with the severest punishment.\r\n\r\n\"What ship is this?\" asked Noddy, when the past had been satisfactorily\r\nexplained by both parties.\r\n\r\n\"The Atlantic, of New Bedford,\" replied the mate. \"She is full of oil,\r\nand is homeward bound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Noddy. \"I suppose I have nothing further to do in this\r\npart of the world, and I may as well go in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"This hasn't been a very profitable cruise to me,\" added Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose there is no help for it; and I hope you will have\r\nbetter luck next time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't grumble; these things can't always be helped. We were lucky to\r\nescape with our lives, and we won't say a word about the wages we have\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you won't lose them,\" added Mollie; and there was a slight\r\nflush on her fair cheeks, for her pride and her filial affection were\r\ntouched by the reflection that these men had suffered from her father's\r\ninfirmity.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the whale ship was entirely willing to take the exiles as\r\npassengers; and Noddy told him he had saved a great many articles, which\r\nmight be of service to him. The next day, when the vessel had taken in\r\nher water, she sailed for the beautiful island. Outside the reef she lay\r\nto, and the boats were sent on shore to bring off such of the goods as\r\nwould be useful on the voyage.\r\n\r\nNoddy and Mollie had an opportunity to visit their island home once\r\nmore; and, while the former assisted the men in selecting and loading\r\nthe goods, the latter gathered fresh flowers, and for the last time\r\nstrewed them on the grave of her father.\r\n\r\nThe \"big heap thigs\" was very much reduced by the visit of the boats;\r\nbut there was still enough left to reward the natives who had befriended\r\nthe young islanders for the service they had rendered. According to the\r\ncaptain's estimate,--which was rather low,--he took about four hundred\r\ndollars' worth of goods from the island. Mollie, as her father's heir,\r\nwas the owner of the property, subject to Noddy's claim for salvage.\r\nWith Mr. Lincoln's aid the accounts were settled. Mollie insisted upon\r\npaying the mate and the three seamen their wages up to the time they\r\nwould reach their native land. This, with their own passage, consumed\r\nnearly the whole sum.\r\n\r\nBesides the property saved from the island, there were about sixteen\r\nhundred dollars in gold and silver, and the valuable nautical\r\ninstruments of Captain McClintock, making a total of over two thousand\r\ndollars. Though the disposition of this property was properly a subject\r\nfor the maritime courts to settle, Mr. Lincoln and the officers of the\r\nship talked it over, and decided that one half belonged to Mollie, in\r\nright of her father, and the other half to Noddy, as salvage,--which is\r\nthe part of property saved from a wrecked imperilled ship, awarded to\r\nthose who save it.\r\n\r\nNoddy at first positively objected to this decree, and refused to take a\r\ndollar from the poor orphan girl; but when the captain told him that a\r\ncourt would probably award him a larger share, and when Mollie almost\r\ncried because he refused, he consented to take it; but it was with a\r\ndetermination to have it applied to her use when he got home. The whale\r\nship filled away when the goods had been taken on board, and weeks and\r\nmonths she stood on her course, till the welcome shores of their native\r\nland gladdened the sight of the exiled children. Mollie had been a great\r\nfavorite with the officers and crew during the voyage, and many of them\r\nwere the wiser and the better for the gentle words she spoke to them.\r\nThe captain sold the nautical instruments, and the money was divided\r\naccording to the decision of the council and officers. Noddy was now the\r\npossessor of about twelve hundred dollars, which was almost a fortune to\r\na boy of twelve. It had been \"work and win\" to some purpose, in spite of\r\nthe disastrous conclusion of the voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE CLERGYMAN AND HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe captain of the whale ship very kindly took the young voyagers to his\r\nown house until their affairs were settled up. He had dealt fairly and\r\njustly by them in all things, and both were grateful to him for the\r\ninterest he had manifested in their welfare.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do now, Noddy?\" asked Mollie, after the\r\ninstruments had been sold and the proceeds paid over to them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to Woodville, now, to face the music,\" replied Noddy. \"I\r\nsuppose they will take me to the court-house; but I have made up my mind\r\nto submit to the penalty, whatever it may be, for setting the boat-house\r\nafire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fanny has told all about it before this time, you may be certain,\"\r\nadded Mollie, to whom he had related the story of the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I hope she has not; for I think I am the guilty one. She wouldn't have\r\nset the fire if it hadn't been for me. I am going to stand right up to\r\nit, and take the consequences, even if they send me to prison; but I\r\nhope they won't do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure they won't. But, Noddy, suppose Miss Fanny has not told the\r\ntruth yet. Will you still deceive your kind friends? You told me you had\r\nbeen made over new since you left Woodville, and I know you have. You\r\nsaid you meant to live a good life, and not lie, or steal, or get angry,\r\nor do anything that is bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I mean so, Mollie. I intend to stick to it. They won't know\r\nanything about that. They won't believe anything I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must believe you. I'll go with you, Noddy!\" exclaimed she, smiling\r\nat the happy thought. \"I will tell them all about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be jolly; and the sooner we go the better.\"\r\n\r\nTheir good friend the captain found a gentleman who was going to New\r\nYork, and they accompanied him, though Noddy felt abundantly able to\r\ntake care of himself and his fair charge. They arrived the next morning,\r\nand took an early train for Woodville.\r\n\r\nNoddy conducted Mollie down the road to the lawn in front of the house.\r\nHis heart bounded with emotion as he once more beheld the familiar\r\nscenes of the past. As he walked along he pointed out to his interested\r\ncompanion the various objects which were endeared to him by former\r\nassociations. He talked because he could not help it; for he was so\r\nagitated he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels. He\r\nheard a step on one of the side paths. He turned to see who it was, and\r\nBertha Grant rushed towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Noddy! It that you?\" cried she, grasping him with both hands. \"I\r\nam so glad to see you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better believe I'm glad to see you again,\" said he, trying to\r\nkeep from crying.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow actually broke down, he was so much affected by the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't expect to see you again for years, after the letter you wrote\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Been cast away, Miss Bertha, and lived two months on an island where\r\nnobody lived,\" blubbered Noddy.\r\n\r\n\"Who is this little girl with you? Is this Mollie, of whom you spoke in\r\nyour letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Bertha, that's Mollie; and she is the best girl in the world,\r\nexcept yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very glad to see you, Mollie,\" said Bertha, taking her hand, and\r\ngiving her a kind reception. \"Now, come into the house.\"\r\n\r\nBertha, finding Noddy so completely overcome by his emotions, refrained\r\nfrom asking him any more questions, though she was anxious to hear the\r\nsad story of the shipwreck. Mr. Grant had not yet gone to the city, and\r\nhe received the returned exiles as though they had been his own\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\"I've come back, Mr. Grant, to settle up old affairs, and you can send\r\nme to the court-house or the prison now. I did wrong, and I am willing\r\nto suffer for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told them all about it, Noddy,\" interrupted Miss Fanny,\r\nblushing. \"I couldn't stand it after you went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was my fault,\" said Noddy. \"I said so then, and I say so now.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't say anything about that until after breakfast. We are very\r\nglad you have come back; and we don't care about thinking of anything\r\nelse, at present,\" said Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was provided for the wanderer and his friend, and Mollie was\r\nsoon made quite at home by the kind attentions of Bertha and Fanny. When\r\nthe meal was ended, Noddy insisted upon \"settling up old affairs,\" as he\r\ncalled it. He declared that the blame ought to rest on him, and he was\r\nwilling to suffer. Mr. Grant said that he was satisfied. Fanny was to\r\nblame, and she had already been severely punished for her fault.\r\n\r\n\"You will not send poor Noddy to prison--will you?\" interposed Mollie.\r\n\"He is a good boy now. He saved my life, and took care of me for months.\r\nYou will find that he is not the same Noddy, he used to be. He is made\r\nover new.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that,\" replied Mr. Grant. \"But Noddy, did you really\r\nthink I intended to send you to jail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; what was the constable after me for, if not for that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a mistake, and I told you so in Albany. Didn't I say you would be\r\na rich man?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, sir; but I thought that was only to catch me. All of them said\r\nsomething of that sort. I knew I couldn't be a rich man, because my\r\nfather never had a cent to leave me. That's what they told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you had an uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never heard of him,\" replied Noddy, bewildered at the prospect before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Your father's only brother died in California more than a year ago. He\r\nhad no family; but an honest man who went with him knew where he came\r\nfrom; and Squire Wriggs has hunted up all the evidence, which fully\r\nproves that all your uncle's property, in the absence of other heirs,\r\nbelongs to you. He left over thirty thousand dollars, and it is all\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Noddy, utterly confounded by this intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"This sum, judiciously invested, will produce at least fifty thousand\r\nwhen you are of age. I have been appointed your guardian.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'm Noddy Newman after this,\" added the heir, in\r\nbreathless excitement.\r\n\r\n\"I know you are not,\" added Bertha, laughing. \"Your real name is Ogden\r\nNewman.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Ogden?\" said Noddy, amused at his new name.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose Noddy came from Ogden,\" said Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"If that's what's the matter, I don't see what you wanted to take me to\r\ncourt for.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you have come to years of discretion, you might have had the\r\nprivilege of naming your own guardian; and we were going to take you to\r\nthe court for that purpose. As you were not here to speak for yourself,\r\nI was appointed. If you are not satisfied, the proceedings can be\r\nreviewed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm satisfied first rate,\" laughed Noddy. \"But you said something about\r\nsending me off.\"\r\n\r\n\"My plan was to send you to the Tunbrook Military Institute, where\r\nRichard is, and make a man of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like that--perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"You gave me a great deal of trouble to find you; and I did not succeed,\r\nafter all,\" added Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know what you was after. If I had, I shouldn't have been in\r\nsuch a hurry. But I guess it was all for the best. I've been at work,\r\nMiss Bertha, since I went away,\" said Noddy, turning to his teacher and\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"Did you win?\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather think I did,\" replied he, depositing his twelve hundred\r\ndollars on the table. \"That's rather better than being a tinker, I\r\nreckon, Miss Bertha.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, if you had seen him work. He did things which a great man could not\r\nhave done,\" said Mollie, with enthusiasm. \"And he's real good, too.\r\nHe'll never do anything wrong again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must hear all about it now, Ogden,\" continued Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ogden; that's your name now.\"\r\n\r\nBetween Noddy and Mollie the story was told; and there was hardly a dry\r\neye in the room when the parts relating to the yellow fever and the\r\nfuneral of Captain McClintock were narrated. Noddy told the burden of\r\nthe story; but he was occasionally interrupted by Mollie, who wanted to\r\ntell how her friend watched over her and her father when they were sick\r\nwith the fever, and what kindness and consideration he had used in\r\nprocuring and burying the remains of her father. Noddy only told facts;\r\nshe supplied what she regarded as very important omissions.\r\n\r\nWhen the narrative was finished, Mr. Grant, and Bertha were willing to\r\nbelieve that Noddy had been made over new; that he had worked, morally\r\nas well as physically, and won, besides the treasure on the table, good\r\nprinciples enough to save him from the errors which formerly beset him;\r\nhad won a child's faith in God, and a man's confidence in himself. The\r\nwhole family were deeply interested in Mollie; they pitied and loved\r\nher; and as she had no near relatives, they insisted upon her remaining\r\nat Woodville.\r\n\r\n\"This is your money, Ogden, and I suppose I am to invest it with the\r\nrest of your property,\" said Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir;\" replied Noddy, promptly. \"You know how I got that money, and\r\nI don't think it belongs to me. Besides, I'm rich, and don't want it.\r\nMollie must have every dollar of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Noddy,\" exclaimed Mr. Grant. \"I approve of that with all my\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no, Noddy. You earned it all,\" said Mollie. \"One hundred dollars\r\nof it was yours before the wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care for that. Mr. Grant shall take care of the whole of it for\r\nyou, or you may take it, as you please.\"\r\n\r\nMollie was in the minority, and she had to yield the point; and Mr.\r\nGrant was instructed to invest all she had, being the entire net\r\nproceeds of what was saved from the wreck.\r\n\r\nAfter the story had been told, all the young people took a walk on the\r\nestate, during which Noddy saw Ben and the rest of the servants. The old\r\nman was delighted to meet him again, and the others were hardly less\r\nrejoiced. The boat-house had been rebuilt. It was winter, and every\r\ncraft belonging to the establishment was housed.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, Noddy, or Ogden, as he was now called, was sent to the\r\nTunbrook Institute; while Bertha found a faithful pupil, and Fanny a\r\ndevoted friend, in Mollie.\r\n\r\nThree months at Woodville convinced Mr. Grant and Bertha that the change\r\nin Noddy was radical and permanent. Though not now required to work, he\r\nwas constantly employed in some useful occupation. He was no longer an\r\nidler and a vagabond, but one of the most industrious, useful, and\r\nreliable persons on the estate.\r\n\r\nHe did not work with his hands only. There was a work for the mind and\r\nthe heart to do, and he labored as perseveringly and as successfully in\r\nthis field as in the other. At Tunbrook he was a hard student, and\r\ngraduated with the highest intellectual honors. From there he went to\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nThe influence of those scenes when the yellow fever was raging around\r\nhim, when the stormy ocean threatened to devour him, and perhaps more\r\nthan all others, when he stood at the open, grave of Captain McClintock,\r\nwas never obliterated from his mind. They colored his subsequent\r\nexistence; and when he came to choose a profession, he selected that of\r\na minister of the gospel.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Ogden Newman is not, and never will be, a brilliant preacher;\r\nbut he is a faithful and devoted \"shepherd of the sheep.\" The humble\r\nparish over whose moral and spiritual welfare he presides is not more\r\nrejoiced and comforted by his own ministrations than by the loving words\r\nand the pure example of the gentle being who now walks hand in hand with\r\nhim in the journey of life, cheered by his presence and upheld by his\r\nstrong arm, as she was in the days of the storm and the pestilence.\r\nMollie McClintock is Mrs. Ogden Newman; and as together they work,\r\ntogether they shall win.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.\r\n\r\nPage 15, \"fond\" changed to \"found\" (found a ready)\r\n\r\nPage 28, line of repeated text was deleted.
