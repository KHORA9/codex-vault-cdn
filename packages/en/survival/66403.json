There are several ways to enjoy the\r\nterraces—hike the boardwalks or drive the Upper Terrace Loop road, for\r\nexample. You may wish to drive to the Upper Terrace Loop, drop off\r\nmembers of your party, let them hike down the boardwalk and pick them up\r\nat the lower parking area. The maps in this pamphlet will help you\r\ndecide how you might best enjoy the terraces._\r\n\r\n_The Mammoth Terraces and Hot Springs were officially discovered by a\r\nU.S. Geological Survey party led by Dr. Ferdinand Hayden in 1871.\r\nHowever, some local knowledge of the Hot Spring Terraces and their\r\nactivity had existed previous to that time._\r\n\r\n_The Mammoth Hot Springs have interested people since the establishment\r\nof Yellowstone National Park, not only for their striking beauty but\r\nalso their changeability. These remarkable springs are noted for their\r\nrapid deposition, unpredictable shifts, and random rejuvenation. Here\r\nthe active forces of geology often make measurable changes from one day\r\nto the next, and it is possible that significant changes have occurred\r\nsince this booklet was printed._\r\n\r\n\r\n_INGREDIENTS FOR HOT SPRINGS ACTIVITY_\r\n\r\nHot water is the life of the terraces. Without it terrace growth ceases;\r\nthe formations weather gray and black, and begin to crumble. Typically\r\nthe many hot springs gush forth at random, flow a short way, then\r\ndisappear into a crack or fissure farther down slope.\r\n\r\nIn searching around the Mammoth area old dormant terrace mounds can be\r\nfound in several places. Although a frequent shifting seems to take\r\nplace, the records over the past several years indicate that the total\r\nflow of water has remained fairly constant at some 500 gallons per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nGround water is the source of the outflow at Mammoth Hot Springs. It is\r\nmostly seepage fed by rain and snow falling high on the slopes of\r\nTerrace Mountain and areas as far south as Norris Geyser Basin. This\r\ncold ground water is heated before it emerges to the surface by rising\r\nheat from the magma chamber which once fueled the violent volcanos of\r\nYellowstone’s past. See the diagram on the reverse of this leaflet. The\r\nwater temperature in these springs reaches the vicinity of 170 F (73 C.)\r\n\r\nYet still another ingredient is needed for growth of the terraces—that\r\nis, a basic building material. The raw material here is calcium\r\ncarbonate. It is abundant beneath Terrace Mountain as thick layers of\r\nsedimentary limestone. Related layers of limestone are visible as\r\noutcrops on the face of Mt. Everts across the narrow valley to the east.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Different temperature zones in the water channels\r\n    paint ribbons of algal color.]\r\n\r\nAs the ground water seeps slowly downward into the limestone it comes in\r\ncontact with hot gases rising from the magma chamber which are heavily\r\ncharged with carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon dioxide is readily\r\nabsorbed to form a carbonic acid solution. Ordinarily water can only\r\nslowly dissolve limestone, but the hot, acidic solution rapidly\r\ndissolves great quantities of it. Saturated with lime, the carbonated\r\nwater continues to seep along the rock layers until it gushes forth as\r\nthe Mammoth Hot Springs.\r\n\r\nOnce exposed to the open air some of the carbon dioxide escapes from the\r\nsolution, thus reducing the acidic level. As this happens, the lime, no\r\nlonger able to remain in solution, is deposited as travertine in the\r\nshape and form of a terrace.\r\n\r\nLooking at the terraces you can visualize the amount of limestone\r\nexcavated. Geologists estimate that the Mammoth Hot Springs water\r\ncarries more than two tons of dissolved limestone to the ground surface\r\neach day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHANGE ON THE MAMMOTH TERRACE_\r\n\r\nThe Mammoth Terraces are continuously changing. Had you visited the area\r\nin the 1930’s, you would have found Blue Spring, Cleopatra, and Angel\r\nTerraces to be the feature attractions. Today they stand as gray,\r\nlifeless ruins, and newly named springs have succeeded them. Throughout\r\nthe 1970’s Jupiter and Minerva Springs and parts of Highland Terrace\r\nhave flowed freely, building delicate and colorful terraces. These clear\r\npools, rimmed by scallops of algae-tinted travertine, have created\r\nspectacles known around the world for their beauty. The tiered pools\r\nform as a result of the peculiar way in which the carbon dioxide escapes\r\nfrom the cooling water. In tranquil pools evaporation is slow. Where\r\nwater is agitated the gas escapes quickly. At these points travertine is\r\ndeposited rapidly. The rim of deposition grows upward to form a higher\r\ndam, which further accents the two zones. The travertine rim continues\r\nto grow until water pressure bursts the dam. Then the process begins\r\nagain at a prominent riffle in the new channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_COLOR IN THE HOT SPRINGS_\r\n\r\nTravertine is deposited as a white mineral, yet whenever hot water\r\nglistens on its surface the formation is brilliant with color. The\r\noranges, yellows, greens and browns are from a great number of tiny\r\nliving bacteria and algae. Approximately sixty-five species of thermal\r\nalgae live in the waters of Mammoth Hot Springs and reflect varying\r\nconditions of such environmental factors as temperature, acidity,\r\nsunlight and carbon dioxide concentrations. White and bright yellow\r\nthermal bacteria predominate in the hottest section of the runoff\r\nchannels near the springs. Farther along where the water has cooled a\r\nbit, the orange, brown and green algaes are most abundant. Different\r\ncombinations of temperature and carbon dioxide paint mosaics of algal\r\ncolor across the terraces.\r\n\r\nMost of the color comes from the group known as the blue-green algae,\r\nwhich display more colors than their name suggests. These thermal algae\r\nare extremely primitive and have probably changed little from those\r\ngrowing in hot springs at the very dawn of life on earth. Amid any\r\nYellowstone thermal basin on a steamy day it is easy to imagine a\r\nvolcanic region on a primitive earth where hot spring waters bubbled up\r\nthrough colored strands of these same types of algae and bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _MAJOR FEATURES OF THE LOWER TERRACES_\r\n\r\n\r\n_OPAL TERRACE_\r\n\r\nOpal Spring flows at the base of Capitol Hill across the road from\r\nLiberty Cap. After years of dormancy, this spring became active in 1926\r\nand began depositing up to a foot of travertine per year. In 1947 a\r\ntennis court was removed to allow natural expansion of the terrace.\r\nFurther growth threatened the historic home next to Opal. Designed by\r\nRobert C. Reamer and built in 1908, the house is an example of Prairie\r\nStyle architecture. Among Reamer’s other designs are the Old Faithful\r\nInn and the Roosevelt Arch. Sandbags and an earthen wall today protect\r\nthe house. It is the mission of the National Park Service to protect\r\nboth historical and natural resources, which come in conflict at Opal\r\nTerrace. Should the spring be restrained or the historic house removed?\r\n\r\n\r\n_LIBERTY CAP_\r\n\r\nThis feature marks the north end of the Mammoth Hot Springs. It was\r\nnamed in 1871 by the Hayden Survey party because of its marked\r\nresemblance to the caps worn by colonial patriots during the\r\nRevolutionary War. It stands today as an extinct hot spring cone. Its\r\nouter surface has been cool and dry for many years and supports a plant\r\ncommunity much different from that found at the active hot springs. Near\r\nthe top are patches of orange lichen which are the pioneers at work\r\nbreaking the rock into soil, paving the way for other plants to follow\r\nat some future time. PLEASE STAY ON THE TRAIL as weathering has loosened\r\nrock fragments which may fall at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MINERVA SPRING_\r\n\r\nMinerva Spring is centrally located within the lower terrace group and\r\nis easily accessible by trail from the various parking areas. This\r\nspring is a favorite not only because of its wide range of bright\r\ncolors, but also for its ornate travertine formations. Since the 1890’s\r\nwhen the first records were kept on the activity of the Mammoth Hot\r\nSprings, Minerva has gone through a series of active and inactive\r\nperiods. For several years in the early 1900’s it was completely dry,\r\nbut by 1951 it was again reported that “Minerva is very active and\r\ncertainly it is the most beautiful spring.” During the 1970’s spring\r\nactivity has increased in some of the other features regenerating algae\r\nmats which now rival those found at Minerva.\r\n\r\n\r\n_JUPITER SPRING_\r\n\r\nJupiter Spring is situated just south of Minerva. It was named in the\r\n1880’s because of its imposing and towering formation. Jupiter was a\r\nRoman god of the elements: the thunderbolt was his sign and the rainbow\r\nhis messenger. If you listen quietly you may hear the hot water\r\nthundering down the terraces of this feature. The rainbow of algae\r\ncovering its terraces is obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _AUTO TOUR OF THE UPPER TERRACE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the Mammoth Terrace Drive is one and one-half miles\r\nsouth of the Mammoth Visitor Center on the road to Norris. This scenic\r\nauto tour winds for one and one-half miles among several active thermal\r\nsprings and has convenient parking pull-outs along the route where you\r\ncan stop and become better acquainted with the features. The drive is a\r\none-way loop road and due to several sharp turns it is necessary to\r\nexclude towing units, buses and motor homes in excess of 25 feet in\r\nlength. Remember that thin crust and very hot water make caution\r\nespecially important when you are near thermal features.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS AREA\r\n    Lower Terraces_]\r\n\r\n  CANARY SPRING\r\n  MAIN TERRACE\r\n  NEW BLUE SPRING\r\n  JUPITER TERRACE\r\n  NAIAD SPRING\r\n  MINERVA TERRACE\r\n  RESERVOIR SPRING\r\n  CAVERN SPRING\r\n  DEVIL’S THUMB\r\n  LIBERTY CAP\r\n  OPAL TERRACE\r\n    UPPER TERRACE DRIVE\r\n    NORRIS AND UPPER TERRACE DRIVE\r\n    MAMMOTH VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n_LOWER TERRACE OVERLOOK_\r\n\r\nThis viewpoint offers an excellent overview of the springs and pools of\r\nthe Lower Terraces. The large blue pool ahead and to the right is Canary\r\nSpring. The pools visible to the left are the New Blue Springs complex.\r\nThe names of these features suggest colors which are inconsistent with\r\nwhat we see today. The color of both features has changed from when they\r\nwere originally named. Changes in environmental conditions may account\r\nfor this: perhaps a change in water temperature.\r\n\r\nThe trail to the left goes around New Blue Spring and on down over the\r\nterraces to Minerva Spring. Near that point the trail branches to the\r\nright to Jupiter Spring and past Minerva itself, or left to Liberty Cap.\r\nBoth routes lead to parking areas along the lower road.\r\n\r\nBeyond the terraces the red-roofed buildings on the right are those of\r\nhistoric Fort Yellowstone, built and occupied by the U.S. Cavalry during\r\ntheir tour of duty here from 1886 to 1918.\r\n\r\nThe ecological community in this section of the upper terraces is worth\r\nnoting. The high content of decayed travertine produces a porous soil\r\nwhich dries out quickly. Consequently, vegetation is sparse and is\r\nlimited to those species which are tolerant of such conditions. Several\r\nvariations may be seen in the plant communities at other points along\r\nthe tour road. What environmental conditions can you detect that might\r\nbe influencing these differences?\r\n\r\n\r\n_NEW HIGHLAND SPRING_\r\n\r\nActivity began at New Highland Spring in 1952. The continuous heavy flow\r\nof mineral laden water has caused a very rapid development of this\r\nbeautiful terrace. Prior to that time a luxuriant growth of trees,\r\nshrubs and flowers covered this hillside. The tree skeletons being\r\nengulfed by travertine stand as monuments to the former conditions.\r\n\r\nTo the right of New Highland still stands a portion of dense vegetative\r\ncover growing on a north facing slope. Most noticeable upon close\r\ninspection is the amount of undergrowth, which includes a heavy growth\r\nof mosses. What soil and moisture conditions are reflected here? Why\r\nwould this area be so different?\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORANGE MOUND SPRING_\r\n\r\nThe bright orange of this formation is a clue to the temperature of its\r\nwater. Also, the rate of flow and the rate of deposition are very slow.\r\nIt could follow then that since we have no record of this spring ever\r\nbeing very active, this small mound could be considerably older than\r\nthose that are much larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BATH LAKE_\r\n\r\nJust ahead of you is a short but very steep hill. At the bottom of this\r\nhill on the right is Bath Lake, named by some of the local residents in\r\nthe 1880’s. Being a quiet pool, deposition of travertine is at a slow\r\nrate and the water remains highly mineralized with limestone. According\r\nto the old records Bath Lake was entirely dry in 1926 and remained that\r\nway until the 1959 earthquake. Although the name of this feature derives\r\nfrom the soldiers’ habit of swimming in it, we now know that this\r\nactivity damages the bacteria and algae which are part of what the park\r\nexists to preserve. Bathing in thermal features is also unsafe and\r\nunlawful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_WHITE ELEPHANT BACK TERRACE_\r\n\r\nThis long white ridge is unusual for a hot spring terrace and adds a\r\ntouch of fantasy to the area. Someone has said that it resembles a\r\nstring of circus elephants marching over the Mammoth Terraces. Take the\r\ntime to view it from different angles to see what you think!\r\n\r\nThe final section of the Upper Terrace Drive goes through a wooded area.\r\nMule deer are frequently seen here, especially during the late afternoon\r\nand evening.\r\n\r\nForest vegetation along this section is dense even though it a\r\nsouth-facing slope. The thermal features in this vicinity are old and\r\nhave been inactive for many years. This has allowed for a more complete\r\ndecomposition of the travertine and an accumulation of a heavier, richer\r\nsoil. Its moisture-holding properties far exceed those of the soil found\r\nat the Lower Terrace Overlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ANGEL TERRACE_\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the hill on the left are the ruins of Angel Terrace.\r\nVisitors during the 1920’s and 30’s saw it as a beautiful algae-tinted\r\nfeature. Today it is beginning to crumble and young pioneer plants are\r\ntaking root in the thin soil over its surface.\r\n\r\nAlteration and change are constantly occurring in the thermal basins and\r\nadd to the mystery of this fascinating land. They bring not destruction\r\nand loss, but rather new birth and gain. Who knows what interesting\r\nornate new features may develop by next year, or in five years. You are\r\nencouraged to return again and again to enjoy this ever-changing scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor your safety and the protection of the fragile features, PLEASE STAY\r\nON THE TRAILS. Pets are not permitted on the trails, for their\r\nprotection and yours.\r\n\r\n                       _EMERGENCY PHONE 344-7381_\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS AREA_ YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK]\r\n\r\n  WHITE ELEPHANT BACK TERRACE\r\n  BATH LAKE\r\n  ORANGE SPRING MOUND\r\n  NEW HIGHLAND SPRING\r\n  ANGEL TERRACE\r\n  CUPID SPRING\r\n  LOWER TERRACE OVERLOOK\r\n  NEW BLUE SPRINGS\r\n  CANARY SPRINGS\r\n  JUPITER SPRINGS\r\n  MINERVA SPRING\r\n  PALETTE SPRING\r\n  OPAL TERRACE\r\n  CAVERN SPRINGS\r\n  RESERVOIR SPRINGS\r\n  LIBERTY CAP\r\n    (ONE WAY)\r\n    NO TRAILERS OR BUSSES\r\n    NORRIS 21 MILES\r\n    TRAILS IN RED\r\n    PICNIC TABLES\r\n    BEAVER PONDS TRAIL (6 mile loop)\r\n    PHOTO SHOP\r\n    SERVICE STATION\r\n    GENERAL STORE\r\n    PHONE\r\n    RESTAURANT\r\n    MAMMOTH MOTOR INN AND CABINS\r\n    VISITOR CENTER\r\n    CHAPEL\r\n    TOWER ROOSEVELT 18 MILES\r\n    HORSE RENTAL\r\n    OLD ROAD TO GARDINER (ONE WAY, GRAVEL)\r\n    ICE VENDOR\r\n    POST OFFICE\r\n    CLINIC\r\n    ADMIN.
