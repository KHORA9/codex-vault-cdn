WILEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PREFACE TO VOLUME FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this volume I have endeavored to place in the hands of teachers and\r\nstudents of Agricultural Analysis, and of analysts generally, the\r\nprinciples which underlie the science and art of the analysis of soils\r\nand the best approved methods of conducting it.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of the work I have drawn freely on the results of\r\nexperience in all countries, but especially in the matter of the\r\nphysical examinations of soils, of this country. Science is not\r\ndelimited by geographic lines, but an author is not to be blamed in\r\nfirst considering favorably the work of the country in which he lives.\r\nIt is only when he can see nothing of good outside of its own boundaries\r\nthat he should be judged culpable. It has been my wish to give full\r\ncredit to those from whose work the subject-matter of this volume has\r\nbeen largely taken. If, in any case, there has been neglect in this\r\nmatter, it has not been due to any desire on my part to bear the honors\r\nwhich rightfully belong to another. With no wish to discriminate, where\r\nso many favors have been extended, especial acknowledgments should be\r\nmade to Messrs. Hilgard, Osborne, Whitney, and Merrill, for assistance\r\nin reading the manuscript of chapters relating to the origin of soils,\r\ntheir physical properties, and mechanical analysis. With the wish that\r\nthis volume may prove of benefit to the workers for whom it was written\r\nI offer it for their consideration.\r\n\r\n                                                            H.

Definitions.=—The term soil, in its broadest sense, is used to\r\ndesignate that portion of the surface of the earth which has resulted\r\nfrom the disintegration of rocks and the decay of plants and animals,\r\nand which is suited, under proper conditions of moisture and\r\ntemperature, to the growth of plants. It consists, therefore, chiefly of\r\nmineral substances, together with some products of organic life, and of\r\ncertain living organisms whose activity may influence vegetable growth\r\neither favorably or otherwise. The soil also holds varying quantities of\r\ngaseous matter and of water, which are important factors in its\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n=2. Origin Of Soil.=—Agriculturally considered, the soil proper is the\r\nolder and more thoroughly disintegrated superficial layer of the earth,\r\nwhich has been longest exposed to weathering and the influences of\r\norganic life. It is usually from six to twelve inches, but occasionally\r\nseveral feet in depth. The subsoil, which lies directly under this, is\r\nnot as a rule so thoroughly disintegrated, since it is protected in a\r\nmeasure by the overlying soil. It usually contains less organic matter\r\nthan the soil. There is a freer circulation of air in the soil than in\r\nthe subsoil, and the metallic elements usually exist therein as higher\r\noxids. There is usually a notable difference in color between the soil\r\nand subsoil, and frequently a very sharp color line separating the two.\r\n\r\nGeologically considered, the soil is that portion of the earth’s crust\r\nwhich has been more or less thoroughly disintegrated by weathering and\r\nother forces from the original rock formations, or from the sedimentary\r\nrocks, or from the unconsolidated sedimentary material. The soil has,\r\ntherefore, the same essential constitution as the general mass of the\r\nearth, except that this débris has been subjected to the solvent action\r\nof water and the influence of vegetable growth.\r\n\r\nPreliminary to the proper understanding of the methods of the analysis\r\nof soils, there should be some definite knowledge concerning the\r\ncomposition of the earth’s crust, so that the analyst may understand\r\nmore thoroughly the origin and nature of the material he has to deal\r\nwith, and thereby be better equipped for his work.\r\n\r\n=3. The Chemical Elements Present in the Soil.=—The chemical elements\r\npresent in the soil are naturally some or all of those which were\r\npresent in the original rocks. For analytical purposes relating to\r\nagriculture, it is not necessary to take into account the rare elements\r\nwhich may occur in the soil, but only those need be considered which are\r\npresent in some quantity and which enter as an important factor into\r\nplant growth. Of the whole number of chemical elements less than twenty\r\nare of any importance in soil analysis. These elements may be grouped\r\ninto two classes, the non-metals, and the metals as follows:\r\n\r\n                         Non-metals.  Metals.\r\n                         Oxygen,     Aluminum,\r\n                         Silicon,    Calcium,\r\n                         Carbon,     Magnesium,\r\n                         Sulfur,     Potassium,\r\n                         Hydrogen,   Sodium,\r\n                         Chlorin,    Iron,\r\n                         Phosphorus, Manganese,\r\n                         Nitrogen,   Barium.\r\n                         Fluorin,\r\n                         Boron.\r\n\r\n=4. Atomic Masses.=—For the purpose of facilitating the calculation of\r\nresults the latest revised table of atomic masses is given below. All\r\nthe known elements are included in this table for the convenience of\r\nanalysts who may have to study some of the rarer elements in the course\r\nof their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This table represents the latest and most trustworthy results reduced\r\n  to a uniform basis of comparison with oxygen = 16 as starting point of\r\n  the system. No decimal places representing large uncertainties are\r\n  used. When values vary, with equal probability on both sides, so far\r\n  as our present knowledge goes, as in the case of cadmium (111.8 and\r\n  112.2), the mean value is given in the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TABLE OF ATOMIC MASSES OF\r\n                             THE ELEMENTS.\r\n                        Revised by F.

Oxygen= exists in the free gaseous state in the atmosphere of which\r\nit constitutes about one-fifth by bulk, whilst in combination with other\r\nelements it forms nearly half the weight of the solid earth, and\r\neight-ninths by weight of water. It enters into combination with all the\r\nother elements, except fluorin, forming what are known as oxids, and\r\nwith many of the elements it unites in several proportions, forming\r\noxids of different composition. Combined with silicon, carbon, sulfur,\r\nand phosphorus, it forms an essential part of the silicates, carbonates,\r\nsulfates, and phosphates, most of which are very abundant and all of\r\nwhich are very widely distributed in the earth’s crust. In this form it\r\nis exceedingly stable and is rarely set free. With the exception of the\r\noxids of silicon these oxids seldom occur uncombined with the metals as\r\nconstituents of rocks or soils. The oxids of iron very commonly occur as\r\nsuch in rocks and soils, and play a very important part in organic life.\r\nThe several oxids of iron very frequently determine the color of soils;\r\nas the iron in a soil is more or less oxidized, or as it is exposed more\r\nor less to access of air, the color of the soil changes. These oxids of\r\niron also play an important part in the absorption capacities of soils\r\nfor moisture and other physical conditions of soils, and also in the\r\noxidation of organic matters in the soil. Many organic substances, and\r\neven the roots of growing plants when deprived of free access of air,\r\ncan readily secure oxygen from the iron oxid, thus reducing the iron to\r\na lower form of oxidation, the oxygen being used for the oxidation of\r\nthe organic matter or for the needs of the growing plant; while the\r\nlower oxid of iron can more readily take up oxygen of the air and again\r\nbe converted into a higher oxid, ready again to give up a part of its\r\noxygen and thus serve as a carrier.\r\n\r\n=6. Silicon= never occurs in the free state, but combined with oxygen it\r\nforms silica, which constitutes more than one-half of the earth’s crust.\r\nThe oxid of silicon occurs in the very common form of quartz, and\r\nlikewise, as silicate of alumina, lime or magnesia. Silicon forms an\r\nessential part of many minerals, such as the feldspars, amphiboles,\r\npyroxenes, and the micas, besides being an essential ingredient of many\r\nother minerals. Silica is relatively very slightly affected by the\r\nordinary forces concerned in the decay of rocks, and even after the\r\ncrystals of feldspars, micas, and other common minerals occurring in\r\nrocks have been disintegrated the silica remains as hard grains of sand,\r\nforming the bulk of most soils. By far the larger part of silicon in\r\nsoils is in the form of grains of quartz or silica. This form, however,\r\nis probably chemically inert in regard to plant growth, but it plays a\r\nvery important part in the physical structure of soils and in the\r\nphysical relation of soils to plant growth.\r\n\r\n=7. Carbon= as an elementary substance occurs as diamond and graphite\r\nand in an impure form as anthracite and bituminous coals. In peats and\r\nmucks carbon is the chief constituent. This substance is also contained\r\nin the organic matters of the soil known as humus, and the relation of\r\nthe carbon to nitrogen often throws important light upon the amount and\r\ncharacter of the nitrogenous matters. In composition with oxygen it\r\nforms the chief food of growing plants, the carbon of the carbon dioxid\r\nof the air being elaborated into the tissue of the plants and the oxygen\r\nreturned to the atmosphere. The content of carbon dioxid in the air is\r\nfrom three to five parts per thousand by volume. As carbonates this\r\nelement helps to form some of the most important ingredients of the\r\nearth’s crust, namely, limestones, marbles, dolomites, etc., and in an\r\norganic form it is found in the shells of the crustaceans. The\r\ncalcareous matter of the soil, that is, the carbonates of the earths\r\ntherein found, are of the highest importance from an agricultural point\r\nof view. The carbonates in the soil not only favor the process of\r\nconverting nitrogenous bodies into forms suitable for plant food, but\r\nalso exert a most potent influence on the physical state of the soil and\r\nits capacity for holding water and permitting its flow to and from the\r\nrootlets of the plant.\r\n\r\n=8. Sulfur= occurs in nature in both the free and combined state. In the\r\nfree state it is found in volcanic regions such as Sicily, Iceland, and\r\nthe western United States. Its usual form of occurrence is in\r\ncombination with the metals to form sulfids, or with oxygen and a metal\r\nto form sulfates. Sulfur and iron combine to form iron pyrites or iron\r\ndisulfid (FeS₂), while sulfur, oxygen, and calcium are found in gypsum,\r\nan important fertilizing compound.\r\n\r\nSulfur plays an important part in the nourishment of plants, being found\r\nin them both as sulfuric acid and in organic compounds. Methods for\r\nestimating the sulfur in both forms will be found in another part of\r\nthis manual.\r\n\r\n=9. Hydrogen= is a colorless, invisible gas, without taste or smell. It\r\noccurs free in small proportions in certain volcanic gases, and in\r\nnatural gas, but its most common form is in combination with oxygen as\r\nwater (H₂O), of which it forms 11.13 per cent by weight. It also occurs\r\nin combination with carbon to form the hydrocarbons, such as the mineral\r\noils (petroleum, etc.) and gases. Hydrogen is of no importance to\r\nagriculture in a free state, but water is the most important of all\r\nplant foods.\r\n\r\n=10. Chlorin= occurs free in nature only in limited amounts and in\r\nvolcanic vents. Its most common form is in combination with hydrogen,\r\nforming hydrochloric acid, or with the metals to form chlorids. It\r\ncombines with sodium to form sodium chlorid or common salt (NaCl), which\r\nis the most abundant mineral ingredient in sea water and which can\r\nusually be detected in rain and ordinary terrestrial waters. In this\r\nform, also, it exists as extensive beds of rock salt, which is mined for\r\ncommercial purposes.\r\n\r\nChlorin is found uniformly in plants and must be regarded as an\r\nessential constituent thereof. Common salt applied to a soil modifies\r\nits power of attracting and holding water.\r\n\r\n=11. Phosphorus= never occurs in nature in a free state but exists in\r\ncombination in greater or less quantities in all soils. Its combinations\r\nare also found in large deposits of minerals known as phosphorite and\r\napatite and as so-called pebble deposit and phosphate rock. Phosphorus\r\nin some sort of combination is one of the most essential elements in\r\nanimal and plant food. In animals its compounds form almost all of the\r\nmineral matter of the bones, and in plants they are the chief\r\nconstituents of the ash of seeds.\r\n\r\nThe mineral deposits of phosphorus, as well as bones, are chiefly\r\ntri-calcium phosphate, while the slag compound resulting from the basic\r\ntreatment of iron ores rich in phosphorus is a tetra-calcium salt.\r\n\r\nThe pebble deposits and some rock phosphates are supposed to be of\r\norganic origin, derived from the remains of marine, terrestrial, and\r\naerial animals.\r\n\r\nCereal crops remove about twenty pounds of phosphoric acid per acre from\r\nthe soil annually and grass crops about twelve pounds. The total\r\nphosphoric acid removed annually by the cereal and grass crops in the\r\nUnited States is nearly four billion pounds.\r\n\r\nGautier[1] calls attention to the fact that the oldest phosphates are\r\nmet with in the igneous rocks such as basalt, trachyte, etc., and even\r\nin granite and gneiss. It is from these inorganic sources, therefore,\r\nthat all phosphatic plant food must have been drawn. In the second order\r\nin age Gautier places the phosphates of hydro-mineral origin. This class\r\nnot only embraces the crystalline apatites but also those phosphates of\r\nlater formation formed from hot mineral waters in the jurassic,\r\ncretaceous, and tertiary deposits. These deposits are not directly\r\nsuited to nourish plants.\r\n\r\nThe third group of phosphates in order of age and assimilability\r\nembraces the true phosphorites containing generally some organic matter.\r\nThey are all of organic origin. In caves where animal remains are\r\ndeposited there is an accumulation of nitrates and phosphates.\r\n\r\nNot only do the bones of animals furnish phosphates but they are also\r\nformed in considerable quantities by the decomposition of substituted\r\nglycerids such as lecithin. The ammonia produced by the nitrification of\r\nthe albuminoid bodies combines with the free phosphoric acid thus\r\nproduced, forming ammonium or diammonium phosphates. The presence of\r\nammonium phosphates in guanos was first noticed by Chevreul more than\r\nhalf a century ago.\r\n\r\nIf such deposits overlay a pervious stratum of calcium carbonate, such\r\nas chalk, and are subject to leaching a double decomposition takes place\r\nas the lye percolates through the chalk. Acid calcium phosphate and\r\nammonium carbonate are produced. By further nitrification the latter\r\nbecomes finally converted into calcium nitrate. In like manner aluminum\r\nphosphates are formed by the action of decomposing organic matter on\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nDavidson,[2] explains the origin of the Florida phosphates by suggesting\r\nthat they arose chiefly through the influx of animals driven southward\r\nduring the glacial period. According to his supposition the waters of\r\nthe ocean, during the cenozoic period contained more phosphorus than at\r\nthe present time. The waters of the ocean over Florida were shallow and\r\nthe shell fish existing therein may have secreted phosphate as well as\r\ncarbonate of lime. This supposition is supported by an analysis of a\r\nshell of _lingula ovalis_, quoted by Dana, in which there were 85.79 per\r\ncent of lime phosphate. In these waters were also many fishes of all\r\nkinds and their débris served to increase the amount of phosphatic\r\nmaterial. As the land emerged from the sea came the great glacial epoch\r\ndriving all terrestrial animals southward. There was, therefore, a great\r\nmammal horde in the swamps and estuaries of Florida. The bones of these\r\nanimals contributed largely to the phosphatic deposits. In addition to\r\nthis, the shallow sea contained innumerable sharks, manatees, whales,\r\nand other inhabitants of tropical waters, and the remains of these\r\nanimals added to the phosphatic store.\r\n\r\nWhile these changes were taking place in the quaternary period, the\r\nFlorida Peninsula was gradually rising, and as soon as it reached a\r\nconsiderable height the process of denudation by the action of water\r\ncommenced. Then there was a subsidence and the peninsula again passed\r\nunder the sea and was covered with successive layers of sand. The\r\nlimestones during this process had been leached by rain water containing\r\nan excess of carbon dioxid. In this way the limestones were gradually\r\ndissolved while the insoluble phosphate of lime was left in suspension.\r\nDuring this time the bones of the animals before mentioned by their\r\ndecomposition added to the phosphate of lime present in the underlying\r\nstrata, while some were transformed into fossils of phosphate of lime\r\njust as they are found to-day in vast quantities.\r\n\r\nWyatt,[3] explains the phosphate deposits somewhat differently.\r\nAccording to him, during the miocene submergence there was deposited\r\nupon the upper eocene limestones, more especially in the cracks and\r\nfissures resulting from their drying up, a soft, finely disintegrated\r\ncalcareous sediment or mud. The estuaries formed during this period were\r\nswarming with animal and vegetable life, and from this organic life the\r\nphosphates were formed by decomposition and metamorphism due to the\r\ngases and acids with which the waters were charged.\r\n\r\nAfter the disappearance of the miocene sea there were great disturbances\r\nof the strata. Then followed the pliocene and tertiary periods and\r\nquaternary seas with their deposits and drifts of shells, sands, clays,\r\nmarls, bowlders, and other transported materials supervening in an era\r\nwhen there were great fluctuations of cold and heat.\r\n\r\nBy reason of these disturbances the masses of the phosphate deposits\r\nwhich had not been infiltrated in the limestones became broken up and\r\nmingled with the other débris and were thus deposited in various mounds\r\nor depressions. The general result of the forces which have been briefly\r\noutlined, was the formation of bowlders, phosphatic débris, etc. Wyatt\r\ntherefore classifies the deposits as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Original pockets or cavities in the limestone filled with hard and\r\nsoft rock phosphates and débris.\r\n\r\n2. Mounds or beaches, rolled up on the elevated points, and chiefly\r\nconsisting of huge bowlders of phosphate rock.\r\n\r\n3. Drift or disintegrated rock, covering immense areas, chiefly in Polk\r\nand Hillsboro counties, and underlying Peace River and its tributaries.\r\n\r\nDarton,[4] ascribes the phosphate beds of Florida to the transformation\r\nof guano. According to this author two processes of decomposition have\r\ntaken place. One of these is the more or less complete replacement of\r\nthe carbonate by the phosphate of lime. The other is a general\r\nstalactitic coating of phosphatic material. Darton further calls\r\nattention to the relation of the distribution of the phosphate deposits\r\nas affecting the theory of their origin, but does not find any peculiar\r\nsignificance in the restriction of these deposits to the western ridge\r\nof the Florida peninsula.\r\n\r\nAs this region evidently constituted a long narrow peninsula during\r\nearly miocene time it is a reasonably tentative hypothesis that during\r\nthis period guanos were deposited from which was derived the material\r\nfor the phosphatization of the limestone either at the same time or soon\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nDarton closes his paper by saying that the phosphate deposits in Florida\r\nwill require careful, detailed geologic exploration before their\r\nrelations and history will be fully understood.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. N. A. Pratt the rock or bowlder phosphate had its\r\nimmediate origin in animal life and to his view the phosphate bowlder is\r\na true fossil. He supposes the existence of some species in former times\r\nin which the shell excreted was chiefly phosphate of lime. The fossil\r\nbowlder, therefore, becomes the remains of a huge foraminifer which had\r\nidentical composition in its skeleton with true bone deposits or of\r\norganic matter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most complete exposition of the theory of the recovery of\r\nwaste phosphates, with especial reference to their deposit in Florida,\r\nhas been given by Eldridge.[5] He calls attention to the universal\r\npresence of phosphates in sea water and to the probability that in\r\nearlier times, as during the miocene and eocene geologic periods, the\r\nwaters of the ocean contained a great deal more phosphate in solution\r\nthan at the present time. He cites the observations of Bischof, which\r\nshow the solubility of different phosphates in waters saturated with\r\ncarbon dioxid. According to these observations apatite is the most\r\ninsoluble form of lime phosphate, while artificial basic phosphate is\r\nthe most soluble. Among the very soluble phosphates, however, are the\r\nbones of animals, both fresh and old. Burnt bones, however, are more\r\nsoluble than bones still containing organic matter. Not only are the\r\norganic phosphates extremely soluble in water saturated with carbon\r\ndioxid, but also in water which contains common salt or chlorid of\r\nammonium. The presence of large quantities of common salt in sea water\r\nwould, therefore, tend to increase its power of absorbing lime\r\nphosphates of organic origin. It is not at all incredible, therefore, to\r\nsuppose that at some remote period the waters of the ocean, as indicated\r\nby these theories, were much more highly charged with phosphates in\r\nsolution than at the present time.\r\n\r\nAccording to Eldridge, the formation of the hard-rock and soft\r\nphosphates may be ascribed to three periods: First, that in which the\r\nprimary rock was formed; second, that of secondary deposition in the\r\ncavities of the primary rock; third, that in which the deposits thus\r\nformed were broken up and the resulting fragments and comminuted\r\nmaterial were redeposited as they now occur.\r\n\r\n“The first of these stages began probably not later than the close of\r\nthe older miocene, and within the eocene area it may have begun much\r\nearlier. Whether the primary phosphate resulted from a superficial and\r\nheavy deposit of soluble guanos, covering the limestones, or from the\r\nconcentration of phosphate of lime already widely and uniformly\r\ndistributed throughout the mass of the original rock, or from both, is a\r\ndifficult question. In any event, the evidence indicates the effect of\r\nthe percolation of surface waters, highly charged with carbonic and\r\nearth acids, and thus enabled to carry down into the mass of the\r\nlimestone dissolved phosphate of lime, to be redeposited under\r\nconditions favorable to its separation. Such conditions might have been\r\nbrought about by the simple interchange of bases between the phosphate\r\nand carbonate of lime thus brought together, or by the lowering of the\r\nsolvent power of the waters through loss of carbonic acid. The latter\r\nwould happen whenever the acid was required for the solution of\r\nadditional carbonate of lime, or when, through aeration, it should\r\nescape from the water. The zone of phosphate deposition was evidently\r\none of double concentration, resulting from the removal of the soluble\r\ncarbonate thus raising the percentage of the less soluble phosphate, and\r\nfrom the acquirement of additional phosphate of lime from the overlying\r\nportions of the deposits.”\r\n\r\n“The thickness of the zone of phosphatization in the eocene area is\r\nunknown, but it is doubtful if it was over twenty feet. In the miocene\r\narea the depth has been proved from the phosphates _in situ_ to have\r\nbeen between six and twelve feet.”\r\n\r\nThe deposits of secondary origin, according to Eldridge, are due chiefly\r\nto sedimentation, although some of them may have been due to\r\nprecipitation from water. This secondary deposition was kept up for a\r\nlong period, until stopped by some climatic or geologic change. The\r\ndeposits of phosphates thus formed in the Florida peninsula are\r\nremarkably free from iron and aluminum, in comparison with many of the\r\nphosphates of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe third period in the genesis of the hard rock deposits embraces the\r\ntime of formation of the original deposits and their transportation and\r\nstorage as they are found at the present time. The geologic time at\r\nwhich this occurred is somewhat uncertain but it was probably during the\r\nlast submergence of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the peculiar formation of the Florida limestone must be\r\nconsidered. This limestone is extremely porous and therefore easily\r\npenetrated by the waters of percolation. A good illustration of this is\r\nseen on the southwestern and southern edges of Lake Okeechobee. In\r\nfollowing down the drainage canal which has been cut into the southwest\r\nshore of the lake the edge of the basin, which is composed of this\r\nporous material may be seen. The appearance of the limestone would\r\nindicate that large portions of it have already given way to the process\r\nof solution. The remaining portions are extremely friable, easily\r\ncrushed, and much of it can be removed by the ordinary dredging\r\nmachines. Such a limestone as this is peculiarly suited to the\r\naccumulation of phosphatic materials, due to the percolation of the\r\nwater containing them. The solution of the limestone and consequent\r\ndeposit of the phosphate of lime is easily understood when the character\r\nof this limestone is considered.\r\n\r\nShaler, as quoted by Eldridge in the work already referred to, refers to\r\nthis characteristic of the limestone and says that the best conditions\r\nfor the accumulation of valuable deposits of lime phosphate in residual\r\ndébris appear to occur where the phosphatic lime marls are of a rather\r\nsoft character; the separate beds having no such solidity as will resist\r\nthe percolation of water through innumerable incipient joints such as\r\ncommonly pervade stratified materials, even when they are of a very soft\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nEldridge is also of the opinion that the remains of birds are not\r\nsufficient to account for the whole of the phosphatic deposits in\r\nFlorida. He ascribes them to the joint action of the remains of birds,\r\nof land and marine animals and to the deposition of the phosphatic\r\nmaterials in the waters in the successive subsidences of the surface\r\nbelow the water line.\r\n\r\n=12. Nitrogen= as a mineral constituent of soils, is found chiefly in\r\nthe form of nitrates, but, owing to their solubility, they can not\r\naccumulate in soils exposed to heavy rain-falls. The gaseous nitrogen in\r\nthe soil is also of some importance, since it is in this material that\r\nthe anaerobic organisms which accumulate on the rootlets of some plants\r\nprobably act in the process of the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in a\r\nform accessible to plants. Nitrogen in the free state, it is believed,\r\nis not directly absorbed into the tissues of plants. It is necessary\r\nthat it be oxidized in some way to nitric acid before it can be\r\nassimilated. The importance of nitrogen as a plant food can not be too\r\nhighly estimated. It is as necessary to plant growth and development as\r\nwater, phosphoric acid, lime, and potash, and far more costly. While a\r\nlarge quantity of nitrogen exists in the air in an uncombined state, it\r\nis, nevertheless, one of the least abundant of the elements of high\r\nimportance in plant nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe conservation and increase of the stores of available nitrogen in the\r\nsoil is one of the chief problems occupying the attention of\r\nagricultural chemistry. Nitrogen, which is not immediately available for\r\nthe growth of plants, is conserved and restored by natural processes in\r\nvarious ways.\r\n\r\nThe waste nitrogen finds its way sooner or later to the sea, and is\r\nrestored therefrom in many forms. Sea-weeds of all kinds are rich in\r\nrecovered nitrogen. Many years ago Forchhammer[6] pointed out the\r\nagricultural value of certain fucoids. Many other chemists have\r\ncontributed important data in regard to the composition of these bodies.\r\n\r\nJenkins[7] has shown from the analyses of several varieties of sea-weeds\r\nthat in the green state they are quite equal in fertilizing value to\r\nstall manure, and are sold at the rate of five cents per bushel. These\r\ndata are fully corroborated by Goessmann.[8]\r\n\r\nWheeler and Hartwell[9] give the fullest and most systematic discussion\r\nwhich has been published of the agricultural value of sea-weeds.\r\nSea-weed was used as a fertilizer as early as the fourth century, and\r\nits importance for this purpose has been recognized more and more in\r\nmodern days, especially since chemical investigations have shown the\r\ngreat value of the food materials contained therein.\r\n\r\nTo show the commercial importance of sea-weed, it is only necessary to\r\ncall attention to the fact that in 1885 its value as a fertilizer in the\r\nState of Rhode Island was $65,044, while the value of all other\r\ncommercial fertilizers was $164,133. While sea-weed, in a sense, can\r\nonly be successfully applied to littoral agriculture, yet the extent of\r\nagricultural lands bordering on the sea is so great as to render its\r\ncommercial importance of the highest degree of interest.\r\n\r\nA large amount of nitrogen is also recovered from the sea in fishes. It\r\nis shown by Atwater[10] that the edible part of fishes has an unusually\r\nhigh percentage of protein. In round numbers, about seventy-five per\r\ncent of the water free edible parts of fish are composed of albuminoids.\r\nSome kinds of fish are taken chiefly for their oil and fertilizing\r\nvalue, as the menhaden. Squanto,[11] an American Indian, first taught\r\nthe early New England settlers the manurial value of fish.\r\n\r\nImmense quantities of waste nitrogen are further secured, both from sea\r\nand land, by the various genera of birds. The well-known habit of birds\r\nin congregating in rookeries during the night and at certain seasons of\r\nthe year tends to bring into a common receptacle the nitrogenous matters\r\nwhich they have gathered and which are deposited in their excrement and\r\nin the decay of their bodies. The feathers of birds are particularly\r\nrich in nitrogen, and the nitrogenous content of the flesh of fowls is\r\nalso high. The decay of remains of birds, especially if it take place\r\nlargely excluded from the leaching of water, tends to accumulate vast\r\ndeposits of nitrogenous matter. If the conditions in such deposits be\r\nfavorable to the processes of nitrification, the whole of the nitrogen,\r\nor at least the larger part of it, which has been collected in this\r\ndébris, becomes finally converted into nitric acid and is found combined\r\nwith appropriate bases as deposits of nitrates. The nitrates of the\r\nguano deposits and of the deposits in caves arise in this way. If these\r\ndeposits be subject to moderate leaching the nitrate may become\r\ninfiltered into the surrounding soil, making it very rich in this form\r\nof nitrogen. The bottoms and surrounding soils of caves are often found\r\nhighly impregnated with nitrates.\r\n\r\nWhile for our purpose, deposits of nitrates only are to be considered\r\nwhich are of sufficient value to bear transportation, yet much interest\r\nattaches to the formation of nitrates in the soil even when they are not\r\nof commercial importance.\r\n\r\nIn many of the soils of tropical regions not subject to heavy\r\nrain-falls, the accumulation of these nitrates is very great. Müntz and\r\nMarcano[12] have investigated many of these soils to which attention was\r\ncalled first by Humboldt and Boussingault. They state that these soils\r\nare incomparably more rich in nitrates than the most fertile soils of\r\nEurope. The samples which they examined were collected from different\r\nparts of Venezuela and from the valleys of the Orinoco as well as on the\r\nshore of the Sea of Antilles. The nitrated soils are very abundant in\r\nthis region of South America where they cover large surfaces. Their\r\ncomposition is variable, but in all of them carbonate and phosphate of\r\nlime are met with and organic nitrogenous material. The nitric acid is\r\nfound always combined with lime. In some of the soils as high as thirty\r\nper cent of nitrate of lime have been found. Nitrification of organic\r\nmaterial takes place very rapidly the year round in this tropical\r\nregion. These nitrated soils are everywhere abundant around caves, as\r\ndescribed by Humboldt, caves which serve as the refuge of birds and\r\nbats. The nitrogenous matters, which come from the decay of the remains\r\nof these animals, form true deposits of guano which is gradually spread\r\naround, and which, in contact with the limestone and with access of air,\r\nsuffers complete nitrification with the fixation of the nitric acid by\r\nthe lime.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of this guano are also due to the débris of insects,\r\nfragments of elytra, scales of the wings of butterflies, etc., which are\r\nbrought together in those places by the millions of cubic meters. The\r\nnitrification, which takes place in these deposits, has been found to\r\nextend its products to a distance of several kilometers through the\r\nsoil. In some places the quantity of the nitrate of lime is so great in\r\nthe soils that they are converted into a plastic paste by this\r\ndeliquescent salt.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Müntz and Marcano in regard to the nitrates of soils,\r\nespecially in the neighborhood of caves, is probably a correct one, but\r\nthere are many objections to accepting it to explain the great deposits\r\nof nitrate of soda which occur in many parts of Chile. Another point,\r\nwhich must be considered also, is this: That the processes of\r\nnitrification can not now be considered as going on with the same vigor\r\nas formerly. Some moisture is necessary to nitrification, inasmuch as\r\nthe nitrifying ferment does not act in perfectly dry soil, and in many\r\nlocalities in Chile where the nitrates are found it is too dry to\r\nsuppose that any active nitrification could now take place.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these nitrate deposits has long been known.[13] The old\r\nIndian laws originally prohibited the collection of the salt, but\r\nnevertheless it was secretly collected and sold. Up to the year 1821,\r\nsoda saltpeter was not known in Europe except as a laboratory product.\r\nAbout this time the naturalist, Mariano de Rivero, found on the Pacific\r\ncoast, in the Province of Tarapacá, immense new deposits of the salt.\r\nLater the salt was found in equal abundance in the Territory of\r\nAntofogasta and further to the south in the desert of Atacama, which\r\nforms the Department of Taltal.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the collection and export of saltpeter from Chile is\r\na business of great importance. The largest export which has ever taken\r\nplace in one year was in 1890, when the amount exported was 927,290,430\r\nkilograms; of this quantity 642,506,985 kilograms were sent to England\r\nand 86,124,870 kilograms to the United States. Since that time the\r\nimports of this salt into the United States have largely increased.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pissis[14] these deposits are of very ancient origin. This\r\ngeologist is of the opinion that the nitrate deposits are the result of\r\nthe decomposition of feldspathic rocks; the bases thus produced\r\ngradually becoming united with the nitric acid provided from the air.\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory of Nöllner[15] the deposits are of more modern\r\norigin and due to the decomposition of marine vegetation. Continuous\r\nsolution of soils, gives rise to the formation of great lakes of\r\nsaturated water, in which occurs the development of much marine\r\nvegetation. On the evaporation of this water, due to geologic isolation,\r\nthe decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter causes generation of\r\nnitric acid, which, coming in contact with the calcareous rocks, attacks\r\nthem, forming nitrate of calcium, which, in presence of sulfate of\r\nsodium, gives rise to a double decomposition into nitrate of sodium and\r\nsulfate of calcium.\r\n\r\nThe fact that iodin is found in greater or less quantity in Chile\r\nsaltpeter is one of the chief supports of this hypothesis of marine\r\norigin, inasmuch as iodin is always found in sea and not in terrestrial\r\nplants. Further than this, it must be taken into consideration that\r\nthese deposits of nitrate of soda contain neither shells nor fossils,\r\nnor do they contain any phosphate of lime. The theory, therefore, that\r\nthey were due to animal origin is scarcely tenable.\r\n\r\n=13. Boron= occurs chiefly in volcanic regions, but is much more widely\r\ndistributed in the soil than formerly believed. It is a regular\r\nconstituent of the ash of many plants,[16] and is, therefore, thought to\r\nbe a true plant food. It is one of the least abundant of the elements,\r\nnot occurring in sufficient quantity to find a place in the table\r\nshowing their relative abundance, which is to follow. Boracic acid is\r\nused to some extent as a preservative.\r\n\r\n=14. Fluorin= does not occur free in nature, but it exists chiefly in\r\ncombination with calcium, forming fluorspar, and traces of it are found\r\nin sea water. It occurs in bone, teeth, blood, and the milk of mammals.\r\nIt is the only element that does not combine with oxygen, and it can be\r\nisolated only with the greatest difficulty. Only very small traces of it\r\nare found ordinarily and it is usually not considered in the chemical\r\nanalysis of soils. Fluorin is found, however, in considerable quantities\r\nin certain phosphate deposits.\r\n\r\n=15. Aluminum= is, probably, next to oxygen and silicon, the most\r\nabundant element of the earth’s crust, of which it is estimated to form\r\nabout one-twelfth. It has never been found, in nature, in the free\r\nstate, but commonly occurs in combination with silicon and oxygen, in\r\nwhich form it is an abundant constituent of feldspar, mica, kaolin,\r\nclay, slate, and many other rocks and minerals.\r\n\r\nBy the weathering of feldspar, mica, and other minerals containing\r\naluminum, kaolin or true clay is formed, which is of the greatest\r\nimportance in the constitution of the soil. The compounds of aluminum\r\nare not so important as plant food as they are as the constituents of\r\nthe soil, forming a large part of its bulk, and modifying in the most\r\nprofound degree its physical properties. It is the custom of some\r\nauthors to use the word clay to designate the fine particles of soil\r\nwhich have in general the same relations to moisture and tilth as the\r\nparticles of weathered feldspar, etc. In a strict chemical sense,\r\nhowever, the term clay is applied only to the hydrated silicate of\r\nalumina formed as indicated above. The fertility of a soil is largely\r\ndependent on the quantity of clay which it contains, its relations to\r\nmoisture and amenability to culture being chiefly conditioned by its\r\nclay content. The determination of the percentage of clay in soils is an\r\noperation of the highest utility in forming an opinion of the value of a\r\nsoil on analytical data alone.\r\n\r\n=16. Calcium= is one of the commonest and most important elements of the\r\nearth’s crust, of which it has been estimated to compose about\r\none-sixteenth. It does not occur free in nature, but its most common\r\nform is in combination with carbon dioxid, forming the mineral calcite,\r\nmarble, and the very abundant limestone rocks. In this form it is\r\nslightly soluble in water containing carbon dioxid, and hence lime has\r\nbecome a universal component of all soils and is very generally found in\r\nnatural waters, in which it furnishes the chief ingredient necessary for\r\nthe formation of the shells and skeletons of the various tribes of\r\nmollusca and corals. In combination with sulfuric acid calcium forms the\r\nrock gypsum. Lime is not only a necessary plant food, but influences in\r\na marked degree the physical condition of the soil and the progress of\r\nnitrification. Many stiff clay soils are rendered porous and pulverulent\r\nby an application of lime, and thus made far more productive. On account\r\nof its great abundance and low price, it has not commanded the degree of\r\nattention from farmers and agricultural chemists which its merits\r\ndeserve. It forms an essential ingredient of plants and animals, in the\r\nlatter being collected chiefly in the bones, while in plants it is\r\nrather uniformly distributed throughout all the tissues.\r\n\r\n=17. Magnesium= occurs chiefly in combination with carbon dioxid or with\r\nlime and carbon dioxid in the mineral dolomite. It is intimately\r\nassociated with calcium and a trace of it is nearly always found where\r\nlime occurs in any considerable quantity. The bitter taste of sea water\r\nand some mineral waters is due to the presence of salts of magnesia. In\r\ncombination with silica it forms an essential part of such rocks as\r\nserpentine, soapstone, and talc. Magnesia is not of much importance as a\r\nplant food nor as a fertilizing material.\r\n\r\n=18. Potassium= combined with silica is an important element in many\r\nmineral silicates as, for instance, orthoclase. Granitic rocks usually\r\ncontain considerable quantities of potassium, and on their decomposition\r\nthis becomes available for plant food. In the form of chlorid, potassium\r\nis found in small quantities in sea water, and as a nitrate it forms the\r\nvaluable salt known as niter or saltpeter. Potassium, as is the case\r\nwith phosphorus, is universally distributed in soils, and forms one of\r\nthe great essential elements of plant food. Under the form of kainite\r\nand other minerals large quantities of potassium are used for\r\nfertilizing and for the manufacture of pure salts for commercial and\r\npharmaceutical purposes. The ordinary potassium salts are very soluble\r\nand for this reason they can not accumulate in large quantities in soils\r\nexposed to heavy rain-fall. In the form of carbonate, potassium forms\r\none of the chief ingredients of hard wood ashes, and in this form of\r\ncombination is especially valuable for fertilizing purposes. Potash\r\nsalts, being extremely soluble, are likely to be held longest in\r\nsolution. Some of them, are recovered in animal and vegetable life, but\r\nthe great mass of potash carried into the sea still remains unaccounted\r\nfor. The recovery of the waste of potash is chiefly secured by the\r\nisolation of sea waters containing large quantities of this salt and\r\ntheir subsequent evaporation. Such isolation of sea waters takes place\r\nby means of geologic changes in the level of the land and sea. In the\r\nraising of an area above the water level there is almost certain to be\r\nan enclosure, of greater or less extent, of the sea water in the form of\r\na lake. This enclosure may be complete or only partial, the enclosed\r\nwater area being still in communication with the main body of the sea by\r\nmeans of small estuaries. If this body of water be exposed to rapid\r\nevaporation, as was doubtless the case in past geologic ages, there will\r\nbe a continual influx of additional sea water through these estuaries to\r\ntake the place of that evaporated. The waters may thus become more and\r\nmore charged with saline constituents. Finally a point is reached in the\r\nevaporation when the less soluble of the saline constituents begin to be\r\ndeposited. In this way the various formations of mineral matter,\r\nproduced by the drying up of enclosed waters, take place.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive potash deposits known are those in the neighborhood\r\nof Stassfurt, in Germany. The following description probably represents\r\nthe method of formation of these deposits:[17]\r\n\r\n“The Stassfurt salt and potash deposits had their origin, thousands of\r\nyears ago, in a sea or ocean, the waters of which gradually receded,\r\nleaving near the coast, lakes which still retained communication with\r\nthe great ocean by means of small channels. In that part of Europe the\r\nclimate was then tropical, and the waters of these lakes rapidly\r\nevaporated but were constantly replenished through these small channels\r\nconnecting them with the main body. Decade after decade this continued,\r\nuntil by evaporation and crystallization, the various salts present in\r\nthe sea water were deposited in solid form. The less soluble material,\r\nsuch as sulfate of lime or ‘anhydrite,’ solidified first and formed the\r\nlowest stratum. Then came common rock salt with a slowly thickening\r\nlayer which ultimately reached 3000 feet, and is estimated to have been\r\n13,000 years in formation. This rock salt deposit is interspersed with\r\nlamellar deposits of ‘anhydrite,’ which gradually diminish towards the\r\ntop and are finally replaced by the mineral ‘polyhalite,’ which is\r\ncomposed of sulfate of lime, sulfate of potash, and sulfate of magnesia.\r\nThe situation in which this polyhalite predominates is called the\r\n‘polyhalite region’ and after it comes the ‘kieserite region,’ in which,\r\nbetween the rock salt strata, kieserite (sulfate of magnesia) is\r\nimbedded. Above the kieserite lies the ‘potash region,’ consisting\r\nmainly of deposits of carnallite, a mineral compound of muriate of\r\npotash and chlorid of magnesia. The carnallite deposit is from 50 to 130\r\nfeet thick and yields the most important of the crude potash salts and\r\nthat from which are manufactured most of the concentrated articles,\r\nincluding muriate of potash.”\r\n\r\n“Overlying this region is a layer of impervious clay which acts as a\r\nwater-tight roof to protect and preserve the very soluble potash and\r\nmagnesia salts, which, had it not been for the very protection of this\r\noverlying stratum, would have been long ages ago washed away and lost by\r\nthe action of the water percolating from above. Above this clay roof is\r\na stratum, of varying thickness of anhydrite, and still above this a\r\nsecond salt deposit, probably formed under more recent climatic and\r\natmospheric influences or possibly by chemical changes in dissolving and\r\nsubsequent precipitation. This salt deposit contains ninety-eight per\r\ncent (often more) of pure salt, a degree of purity rarely elsewhere\r\nfound. Finally, above this are strata of gypsum, tenacious clay, sand,\r\nand limestone, which crop out at the surface.”\r\n\r\n“The perpendicular distance from the lowest to the upper surface of the\r\nStassfurt salt deposits is about 5000 feet (a little less than a mile),\r\nwhile the horizontal extent of the bed is from the Harz Mountains to the\r\nElbe River in one direction, and from the city of Madgeburg to the town\r\nof Bernburg in the other.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Fuchs and DeLauny[18] the saline formation near Stassfurt\r\nis situated at the bottom of a vast triassic deposit surrounding\r\nMadgeburg. The quantity of sea water which was evaporated to produce\r\nsaline deposits of more than 500 meters in thickness must have been\r\nenormous and the rate of evaporation great. It appears that a\r\ntemperature of 100° would have been quite necessary, acting for a long\r\ntime, to produce this result.\r\n\r\nThese authors therefore admit that all the theories so far advanced to\r\nexplain the magnitude of these deposits are attended with certain\r\ndifficulties. What, for instance, could have caused a temperature of\r\n100°? The most reasonable source of this high temperature must be sought\r\nfor in the violent chemical action produced by the double decompositions\r\nof such vast quantities of salts of different kinds. There may also have\r\nbeen at the bottom of this basin some subterranean heat such as is found\r\nin certain localities where boric acid is deposited.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the explanation of the source of the heat it will be\r\nadmitted that at the end of the permian period there was thrown up to\r\nthe northeast of the present saline deposits a ridge extending from\r\nHelgoland to Westphalia. This dam established throughout the whole of\r\nNorth Germany saline lagoons in which evaporation was at once\r\nestablished, and these lagoons were constantly fed from the sea.\r\n\r\nThere was then deposited by evaporation, first of all a layer of gypsum\r\nand afterwards rock salt, covering with few exceptions the whole of the\r\narea of North Germany.\r\n\r\nBut around Stassfurt there occurred at this time geologic displacements,\r\nthe saline basin was permanently closed and then by continued\r\nevaporation the more deliquescent salts, such as polyhalite, kieserite,\r\nand carnallite, were deposited.\r\n\r\nThese theories account with sufficient ease for the deposition of the\r\nsaline masses, but do not explain why in those days the sea water was so\r\nrich in potash and why potash is not found in other localities where\r\nvast quantities of gypsum and common salt have been deposited. It may be\r\nthat the rocks composing the shores of these lagoons were exceptionally\r\nrich in potash and that this salt was, therefore, in a certain degree, a\r\nlocal contribution to the products of concentration.\r\n\r\n=19. Sodium= is never found free in nature, but its most common form is\r\nin combination with chlorin as common salt, an important ingredient of\r\nsea water. Combined with silica sodium is an important element in many\r\nsilicates. Sodium, although closely related to potassium chemically,\r\ncannot in any case be substituted therefor in plant nutrition. In\r\ncombination with nitrogen it forms soda or Chile saltpeter which is a\r\nvaluable fertilizer on account of its content of nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=20. Iron= is the most abundant of the heavy metals, and occurs in\r\nnature both free and combined with other elements. In the free state it\r\nis found only to a limited extent in basaltic rocks and meteorites, but\r\nin combination with oxygen it is one of the most widely diffused of\r\nmetals, and forms the coloring matter of a large number of rocks and\r\nminerals. In this form, too, it exists as the valuable ores of iron\r\nknown as magnetite and hematite. In combination with sulfur it forms the\r\nmineral pyrite, FeS₂. The yellow and red colors of soils are due chiefly\r\nto iron oxids. It is an important plant food, although not taken up in\r\nany great quantity by the tissues of plants.\r\n\r\n=21. Manganese=, next to iron, is the most abundant of the heavy metals.\r\nIt occurs in nature only in combination with oxygen, in which form it is\r\nassociated in minute quantities with iron in igneous rocks or in the\r\nforms known mineralogically as pyrolusite, psilomelane and wad. As the\r\nperoxid of manganese it occurs in concretionary forms scattered\r\nabundantly over the bottom of the deep sea. It is found in the ash of\r\nsome plants but is not believed to be an essential to plant growth.\r\n\r\n=22. Barium= occurs in nature combined with sulfuric acid, forming the\r\nmineral barite, or heavy spar, or with carbon dioxid forming the mineral\r\nwitherite. It is of small importance from an agricultural standpoint.\r\n\r\n=23. Relative Abundance of the More Important Chemical Elements.=—It\r\nwill be of interest to the agricultural analyst to know as nearly as\r\npossible the relative abundance of the more important chemical elements.\r\nThis subject has been carefully studied by Prof. F. W. Clarke in a paper\r\nread before the Philosophical Society of Washington.[19] The materials\r\nconsidered in these calculations are the atmosphere, the water, and the\r\nsolid crust of the earth to the depth of ten miles below the sea level.\r\nOf these materials the relative quantities of the three constituents\r\nnamed are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                         Per cent.\r\n      Atmosphere                                              0.03\r\n      Water                                                   7.08\r\n      Solid crust of the earth to the depth of ten miles     92.89\r\n\r\nAccording to these calculations the relative abundance of the important\r\nelements composing the atmosphere, the water of the ocean and the solid\r\ncrust of the earth to the depth given is as follows:\r\n\r\n                 Solid crust,      Ocean, seven per     Mean, including\r\n               ninety-three per          cent.               air.\r\n                     cent.\r\n Oxygen          47.29 per cent.     85.79 per cent.     49.98 per cent.\r\n Silicon         27.21   „   „               „   „       25.30   „   „\r\n Aluminum         7.81   „   „               „   „        7.26   „   „\r\n Iron             5.46   „   „               „   „        5.08   „   „\r\n Calcium          3.77   „   „        0.05   „   „        3.51   „   „\r\n Magnesium        2.68   „   „        0.14   „   „        2.50   „   „\r\n Sodium           2.36   „   „        1.14   „   „        2.28   „   „\r\n Potassium        2.40   „   „        0.04   „   „        2.23   „   „\r\n Hydrogen         0.21   „   „       10.67   „   „        0.94   „   „\r\n Titanium         0.33   „   „               „   „        0.30   „   „\r\n Carbon           0.22   „   „       0.002   „   „        0.21   „   „\r\n Chlorin          0.01   „   „      2.07 }   „   „        0.15   „   „\r\n Bromin                  „   „      0.008}   „   „       „         „\r\n Phosphorus       0.10   „   „               „   „        0.09   „   „\r\n Manganese        0.08   „   „               „   „        0.07   „   „\r\n Sulfur          0.03+   „   „        0.09   „   „       0.04+   „   „\r\n Barium           0.03   „   „               „   „        0.03   „   „\r\n Nitrogen                „   „               „   „        0.02   „   „\r\n Chromium         0.01   „   „               „   „        0.01   „   „\r\n                ——————             ———————              ——————\r\n                100.00   „   „     100.000   „   „      100.00   „   „\r\n\r\n=24. Fluorin= is not mentioned in this table but it is stated that its\r\nprobable percentage is 0.02 to 0.03 making it thus slightly more\r\nabundant than nitrogen.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief points of interest in connection with this table is\r\nthat the nitrogen which is regarded by most persons as one of the most\r\nabundant of the elements is almost the least abundant of those\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE MINERALS OCCURRING IN ROCKS.\r\n\r\n=25. The Soil=, as before stated, being comprised almost exclusively of\r\ndecayed rocks, its characteristics would naturally be determined by the\r\ncharacter of the minerals contained in the rocks.\r\n\r\nA rock may be composed of a single mineral or an aggregation of several\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nAccording to the authority of the National Museum[20] it may occur,\r\neither in the form of stratified beds, eruptive masses, sheets or dikes,\r\nor as veins and other chemical deposits of comparatively little\r\nimportance as regards size and extent. The mineral composition of rocks\r\nis greatly simplified by the wide range of conditions under which the\r\ncommonest minerals can be formed. Thus quartz, feldspar, mica, the\r\nminerals of the hornblende, or pyroxene group, can be formed from a mass\r\ncooling from a state of fusion; they may be crystallized from solution,\r\nor be formed from volatilized products. They are therefore the commonest\r\nof minerals and are rarely excluded from rocks of any class, since there\r\nis no process of rock formation which determines their absence.\r\n\r\nMost of the common minerals, like the feldspars, micas, hornblendes,\r\npyroxenes, and the alkaline carbonates possess the capacity of adapting\r\nthemselves to a very considerable range of compositions. In the\r\nfeldspars, for example, lime, soda, or potash may replace one another\r\nalmost indefinitely, and it is now commonly assumed that true species do\r\nnot exist, but all are but isomorphous admixtures passing into one\r\nanother by all gradations, and the names albite, oligoclase, anorthite,\r\netc., are to be used only as indicating convenient stopping and starting\r\npoints in the series. Hornblende or pyroxene, further, may be pure\r\nsilicate of lime and magnesia, or iron and manganese may partially\r\nreplace these substances. Lime carbonate may be pure, or magnesia may\r\nreplace the lime in any proportion.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations are sufficient to show the reason for the great\r\nsimplicity of rock masses as regards their chief mineral constituents.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the conditions of the origin of a rock mass, the\r\nprobabilities are that it will be formed essentially of one or more of a\r\nhalf a dozen minerals in some of their varieties.\r\n\r\nBut however great the adaptability of these few minerals may be they\r\nare, nevertheless, subject to very definite laws of chemical\r\nequivalence. There are elements which they cannot take into their\r\ncomposition, and there are circumstances which retard their formation\r\nwhile other minerals may be crystallizing. In a mass of rock of more or\r\nless accidental composition formed under these widely varying conditions\r\nit may, therefore, be expected that other minerals will form, in\r\nconsiderable numbers, but minute quantities. It is customary to speak of\r\nthose minerals which form the chief ingredients of any rock, and which\r\nmay be regarded as characteristic of any particular variety, as the\r\nessential constituents, while those which occur in but small quantities,\r\nand whose presence or absence does not fundamentally affect its\r\ncharacter, are called accessory constituents. The accessory mineral\r\nwhich predominates, and which is, as a rule, present in such quantities\r\nas to be recognizable by the unaided eye, is the characterizing\r\naccessory. Thus a biotite granite is a stone composed of the essential\r\nminerals quartz and potash feldspar, but in which the accessory mineral\r\nbiotite occurs in such quantities as to give a definite character to the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n=26. Classification Of Minerals.=—The minerals of rocks may also be\r\nconveniently divided into two groups, according as they are products of\r\nthe first consolidation of the mass or of subsequent changes. This is\r\nthe system here adopted. We thus have:\r\n\r\n(1) The original or primary constituents, those which formed upon its\r\nfirst consolidation. All the essential constituents are original, but on\r\nthe other hand all the original constituents are not essential. Thus, in\r\ngranite, quartz and orthoclase are both original and essential, while\r\nberyl and zircon or apatite, though original, are not essential.\r\n\r\n(2) The secondary constituents are those which result from changes in a\r\nrock subsequent to its first consolidation, changes which are due in\r\ngreat part to the chemical action of percolating water. Such are the\r\ncalcite, chalcedony, quartz, and zeolite deposits which form in the\r\ndruses and amygdaloidal cavities, of traps and other rocks.\r\n\r\nBelow is given a list of the more common, original and secondary\r\nminerals occurring in rocks. It will be observed that the same mineral\r\nmay, in certain cases, occur in both original and secondary forms. The\r\ntables following were prepared by Dr. George P. Merrill.\r\n\r\n                           ORIGINAL MINERALS.\r\n\r\n    1. Quartz, SiO₂.\r\n\r\n    2. The Feldspars:\r\n\r\n 2a. Orthoclase.

Types Of Rocks.=—Rocks may be divided in reference to their\r\nstructure into four types: First, crystalline; second, vitreous; third,\r\ncolloidal; fourth, fragmental.\r\n\r\nOf these classes there may be selected, as types of the first order,\r\ngranite and crystalline limestone.\r\n\r\nThe second class is typically represented by obsidian. Rocks of this\r\nkind are confined to a volcanic origin.\r\n\r\nThe third class of rocks is completely amorphous in its structure and is\r\nless common than the others. It is found only in rocks of chemical\r\norigin. Types of this class are the siliceous sinters, opals, flint\r\nnodules, and many serpentines.\r\n\r\nOf the fourth class of rocks, sandstone is typical, being comprised\r\nwholly of fragments of rocks pre-existing. The particles may be held\r\ntogether either by cohesion or by a cement composed of silica, iron\r\noxids, carbonate of lime or clayey matter.\r\n\r\n=28. The Microscopical Structure of Rocks.=—A great deal more light is\r\nthrown upon the nature of rock materials by microscopical study than by\r\ntheir study in bulk. The requisites for a microscopical study of rock\r\nare that the material should be cut into extremely thin laminae with\r\nparallel sides and polished so as to transmit the light freely. The\r\nstudy of the crystalline structure of the material is then conducted by\r\nmeans of a microscope furnished with polarizing and analyzing\r\nappliances. The light before passing through the mineral film is\r\npolarized by a Nicol prism. After passing through the film it is\r\nanalyzed by a second Nicol prism. In this way the crystalline structure\r\nof the rock as affecting polarized light is distinctly brought out. The\r\nthickness of the films examined should be from ¹⁄₅₀₀ to ¹⁄₆₀₀ of an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1. Microstructure of granite.\r\n  FIG. 2.

Microstructure of serpentine.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe method of rock study by thin microscopic sections is one of\r\ncomparatively recent origin. It is scarcely more than a dozen years\r\nsince the process was fairly adopted by mineralogists. The value of the\r\nmethod is based upon the fact that every crystalline mineral has certain\r\ndefinite optical properties. Therefore, when a crystalline mineral is\r\ndistorted or misshapen so as to be incapable of identification by the\r\nordinary method, it can be at once identified by its optical examination\r\nin the manner just described. In this way not only can one mineral be\r\ndistinguished from another, but the crystalline system to which it\r\nbelongs can be accurately pointed out. The value of the method is well\r\nsummed up by Merrill,[21] who says that it is not merely an aid in\r\ndetermining the mineralogical composition of a rock, but also, which is\r\noften much more important, its structure and the various changes which\r\nhave taken place in it since its first consolidation. Rocks are not the\r\ndefinite and unchangeable mineral compounds they were once considered,\r\nbut are rather ever varying aggregates of minerals which even in\r\nthemselves undergo structural and chemical changes almost without\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nAnother valuable result of such a study is illustrated by the discovery\r\nthat the structural features of a rock are not dependent upon its\r\nchemical composition or geologic age, but upon the conditions under\r\nwhich it cooled from the molten magma. Portions of the same rock may\r\nvary all the way from a wholly crystalline to a pure vitreous form.\r\n\r\nSome typical microstructures of crystalline rocks are shown in the\r\naccompanying figures 1–6.[22]\r\n\r\nAlthough this method of study has thus far been confined mainly to\r\ncrystalline rocks, its efficiency is by no means limited to them. The\r\nfragmental rocks and their decomposed débris to which the name soil is\r\ngiven are equally worthy of study by this method. Indeed, the full value\r\nof a chemical analysis of any rock or soil can not be ascertained unless\r\nsuch an analysis is accompanied by a microscopic examination. It is\r\ndesirable to know not merely what there is in any soil, but in what form\r\nthese compounds exist. To this latter question the chemical analysis as\r\nordinarily made will give no clew. In Germany a beginning has been made\r\nin this line of work, and American scientists are beginning to realize\r\nits importance. An outline of this method of analysis will be given in\r\nthe proper place.\r\n\r\n=29. Specific Gravity.=—Much information in regard to the properties of\r\na rock, or mineral constituent thereof, may be derived from its specific\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nThe internal structure of a rock may have much to do with its apparent\r\nspecific gravity. As an instance of this, it may be stated that an\r\nobsidian pumice will float upon water, buoyed up by the air contained in\r\nits vesicles, while a compact obsidian of the same composition will sink\r\nimmediately. A careful discrimination must, therefore, be made between\r\napparent and true specific gravity. In general it may be said that\r\ncrystalline rocks have a higher specific gravity than those of a\r\nvitreous nature. The specific gravity is, therefore, largely dependent\r\nupon chemical and crystallographic properties; for instance, among\r\nsiliceous rocks those which contain the largest amount of silica are the\r\nlightest, while those with a comparatively small amount, but rich in\r\niron, lime, and magnesia, are heaviest.\r\n\r\n=30. Chemical Composition of Rocks.=—Rocks are often classified with\r\nrespect to the chief mineral constituent which they contain. Rocks which\r\nare composed largely of lime are termed calcareous; of silica,\r\nsiliceous; of iron, ferruginous; and of clay, argillaceous. In respect\r\nof eruptive rocks, it is customary to speak of those which show above\r\nsixty per cent of silica as acidic, while those containing less than\r\nfifty per cent of silica and a correspondingly larger amount of iron,\r\nlime, and magnesia, are spoken of as basic. Illustrations of the\r\nclassification of rocks on the above principles are given below.[23]\r\n\r\n                            STRATIFIED ROCKS.\r\n ──────────────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n           Kind.           │   Specific   │        Composition.\r\n                           │   Gravity.   │\r\n ──────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Calcareous:               │              │\r\n   Compact limestone       │  2.6 to 2.8  │     Carbonate of lime.\r\n   Crystalline limestone   │      „       │              „\r\n                           │              │\r\n   Compact dolomite        │ 2.8 to 2.95  │    Carbonate of lime and\r\n                           │              │          magnesia.\r\n   Crystalline dolomite    │      „       │              „\r\n                           │              │\r\n Siliceous:                │              │\r\n   Gneiss                  │  2.6 to 2.7  │      Same as granite.\r\n   Siliceous sandstone     │     2.6      │       Mainly silica.\r\n   Schist                  │  2.6 to 2.8  │  60 to 80 per cent silica.\r\n                           │              │\r\n Argillaceous:             │              │\r\n   Clay slate (argillite)  │     2.5      │ Mainly silicate of alumina.\r\n ──────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n                           │              │\r\n                             ERUPTIVE ROCKS.\r\n ──────────────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n                           │   Specific   │      Per cent silica.\r\n                           │   Gravity.   │\r\n ──────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────\r\n Acidic Group:             │              │\r\n   Granite                 │ 2.58 to 2.73 │       77.65 to 62.90\r\n   Liparite                │ 2.53 to 2.70 │       76.06 to 67.61\r\n   Obsidian                │ 2.26 to 2.41 │       82.80 to 71.19\r\n   Obsidian pumice         │  Floats on   │       82.80 to 71.19\r\n                           │    water.    │\r\n                           │              │\r\n Intermediate Group:       │              │\r\n   Syenite                 │ 2.73 to 2.86 │       72.20 to 54.65\r\n   Trachyte                │ 2.70 to 2.80 │       64.00 to 60.00\r\n   Hyalotrachyte           │ 2.4  to 2.5  │       64.00 to 60.00\r\n   Andesite                │ 2.54 to 2.79 │       66.75 to 54.73\r\n                           │              │\r\n Basic Group:              │              │\r\n   Diabase                 │ 2.66 to 2.88 │       50.00 to 48.00\r\n   Basalt                  │ 2.90 to 3.10 │       50.59 to 40.74\r\n   Peridotite              │ 3.22 to 3.29 │       42.65 to 33.73\r\n   Peridotite (iron rich)  │     3.86     │            23.00\r\n   Peridotite (meteorite)  │     3.51     │            37.70\r\n ──────────────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n=31. Color Of Rocks.=—The color of rocks is determined chiefly by the\r\noxids of metals which they contain and the degree of oxidation of the\r\nmineral in each particular case. There are, however, many colors of\r\nrocks which seem to depend not upon any particular mineral ingredient\r\nwhich they contain, but upon some particular crystalline structure or\r\nphysical condition.\r\n\r\nThe chief coloring matters in minerals are those which form colored\r\nbases such as iron, manganese, chromium, etc. The yellow, brown, and red\r\ncolors, common to fragmental rocks, are due almost wholly to free oxids\r\nof iron. The gray, green, dull brown, and even black colors of\r\ncrystalline rocks are due to the presence of free iron oxids or to the\r\nprevalence of silicate mineral rich in iron, as augite, hornblende, or\r\nblack mica. Rarely copper and other metallic oxids than those of iron\r\nare present in sufficient abundance to impart their characteristic hues.\r\nAs a rule, a white or light-gray color denotes an absence of an\r\nappreciable amount of iron in any of its forms. The bluish and black\r\ncolors of many rocks, particularly the limestones and slates, are due to\r\nthe presence of carbonaceous matter.\r\n\r\nIn still other cases, and particularly the feldspar-bearing rocks, the\r\ncolor may be due in part to the physical condition of the feldspar.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the color of rocks is due so largely to metallic oxids, it\r\nis easy to see that they may undergo changes when exposed to weathering,\r\nor the degree of oxidation may change, and either, together with changes\r\nin the physical structure of the rock, may cause a distinct change in\r\ncolor. Luster is often considered in connection with color, and is due\r\nalmost exclusively to physical conditions.\r\n\r\n=32. Kinds of Rocks.=—The rocks which form any essential part of the\r\nearth’s crust are grouped under four main heads, the distinction being\r\nbased upon their origin and structure.[24] Each of the main divisions\r\nmay be subdivided into groups or families, the distinction being based\r\nmainly upon chemical composition, structure, and mode of occurrence. The\r\nfour chief families are:\r\n\r\nFirst, aqueous rocks, formed mainly through the agency of water as\r\nchemical precipitates or as sedimentary beds.\r\n\r\nSecond, aeolian rocks formed from wind-drifted materials.\r\n\r\nThird, metamorphic rocks, changed from their original condition through\r\ndynamic or chemical agencies, and which may have been partly of aqueous\r\nand partly of igneous origin.\r\n\r\nFourth, igneous or eruptive rocks, which have been brought up from below\r\nin a molten condition, and which owe their present structural\r\npeculiarities to variations in composition and conditions of\r\nsolidification.\r\n\r\n=33. Aqueous Rocks.=—Aqueous rocks may be divided into the following\r\ngeneral classes:\r\n\r\nFirst, rocks formed as chemical precipitates.\r\n\r\nSecond, rocks formed as sedimentary deposits and fragmental in\r\nstructure. The second class may again be subdivided into rocks formed by\r\nmechanical agencies and mainly of inorganic materials; and second, rocks\r\ncomposed mainly of the débris of plant and animal life.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first form of aqueous rocks, namely, those formed as\r\nchemical precipitates, it may be said that while their quantity is not\r\nlarge they are yet of considerable importance from an agricultural point\r\nof view. They embrace those substances which, having once been in a\r\ncondition of vapor or aqueous solution, have been deposited or\r\nprecipitated, either by cooling or by the evaporation of the liquor\r\nholding them in solution, or by coming in contact with chemical\r\nsubstances capable of precipitating them. The influence of water as a\r\nsolvent is perhaps not fully appreciated. Its solvent influence will be\r\nnoted particularly under the head of weathering or decay of rocks. Its\r\nimportance, however, in producing stratified rocks has been very great.\r\nWater, especially when under great pressure and at a high temperature,\r\nhas the power of dissolving many minerals. This power is often greatly\r\nincreased by the mineral matter previously in solution in the water or\r\nby the gases which it may contain. As an illustration of the latter\r\nproperty, the solvent action of water charged with carbon dioxid on\r\nlimestone may be cited.\r\n\r\nWhen mineral matters have been dissolved by the water in the ways\r\nmentioned and carried with the water beyond the condition where the\r\nsolution has taken place, new conditions are found favorable to the\r\nprecipitation of the dissolved matters. The water, which before may have\r\nbeen very hot, may reach a place where it cools, and being a\r\nsupersaturated solution, the excess of the material is thrown down as\r\nthe water cools.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the solution be due to the presence of carbon\r\ndioxid and the water reach a place where it is exposed to the air or\r\nwhere the pressure under which the abundance of the gas has been due is\r\ndiminished, the carbon dioxid will escape and the mineral matters which\r\nhave been dissolved thereby will be precipitated.\r\n\r\nThe incrustations which often appear round the mouth of springs and the\r\noccurrence of stalagmites and stalactites in caves are illustrations of\r\nthis action.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the formation of rocks as precipitates from a state of\r\nvapor we have scarcely any illustrations excepting in volcanic regions.\r\nRocky materials with which we are generally acquainted are practically\r\nnon-volatile at the highest temperature which can be secured on the\r\nearth’s surface, but it is possible that in the interior of the earth\r\nthe temperature may be so high as to maintain many substances in a state\r\nof vapor.\r\n\r\nThey may, in this case, become disassociated so that the compounds or\r\nelements exist distinctly in a vaporous condition. Such a vapor\r\ntransported to regions of diminished temperature would first of all on\r\ncooling permit a union of the chemical elements forming new compounds\r\nless volatile, which, of course, would be at once precipitated.\r\n\r\nThe rocks and minerals formed in this way which are of some agricultural\r\nimportance may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\nOxids, carbonates, silicates, sulfur, sulfids, sulfates, phosphates,\r\nchlorids, and hydrocarbon compounds, the most important from an\r\nagricultural point of view being the phosphates.\r\n\r\nThe second group of rocks, namely those formed as sedimentary deposits,\r\ndiffer from those just described in that they are comprised mainly of\r\nfragmental materials derived from the breaking down of pre-existing\r\nrocks. The formation of fragmental rocks includes, therefore, the same\r\nprocesses as are active in the formation of arable soil. They are\r\ndeposited from water, and are as a rule distinctly stratified.\r\n\r\nThrough the action of pressure and the heat thereby generated, or simply\r\nthrough the chemical action of percolating solutions, such rocks pass\r\nover into the crystalline sedimentary forms known as metamorphic. All\r\nmetamorphic rocks, however, are not of a sedimentary origin. For\r\ninstance, by pressure, heat, and the chemical changes thereby induced,\r\ngranite may be changed into gneiss and the latter would then be a\r\nmetamorphic rock.\r\n\r\nThis group of sedimentary rocks and of sedimentary material, either\r\nunchanged or metamorphosed, is of vast extent and includes materials of\r\nwidely varying chemical and mineralogical nature. They form by far the\r\ngreater portion of the present surface of the earth, even the mountain\r\nranges being composed mainly of this sedimentary material. Indeed, in\r\nthe whole of this country there is only a comparatively very small\r\nextent of igneous or irruptive rocks. They are of great importance from\r\na purely scientific, as well as agricultural standpoint, since they\r\ncontain the fossil records of past geologic ages. From them it is\r\npossible to study the variations in climate, the meteorological\r\nconditions in circumstances and periods far remote, and thus form some\r\nidea of the process by which the crust of the earth has been modified by\r\nnatural forces from its original form to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks may be divided, with sufficient accuracy for our\r\npurposes, into two great classes: First, rocks formed by mechanical\r\nagencies and mainly of inorganic materials. These are subdivided again\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n(a) The arenaceous group.\r\n\r\n(b) The argillaceous group.\r\n\r\n(c) The volcanic group.\r\n\r\nThe second class of sedimentary rocks is formed largely, or in part at\r\nleast, by mechanical agencies, but is comprised chiefly of the débris of\r\nplant and animal life. It may be subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) The siliceous group, such as infusorial earth.\r\n\r\n(b) The calcareous group, fossiliferous formations, limestone, etc.\r\n\r\n(c) The carbonaceous group, such as peat, lignite, coals, etc. The\r\ndifferent classes of rock described above are distinguished by special\r\nqualities represented largely by the name. The first division, the\r\narenaceous group, is composed mainly of the siliceous or coarsely\r\ngranular materials derived from the disintegration of older crystalline\r\nrocks, which have been rearranged in beds of varying thickness through\r\nthe mechanical agency of water. They are, in short, consolidated or\r\nunconsolidated beds of sand and gravel. In composition and texture they\r\nvary almost indefinitely. Many of them having suffered little during the\r\nprocess of disintegration and transportation are composed essentially of\r\nthe same materials as the rocks from which they were derived.\r\n\r\nThe sandstones, which are the type of these rocks, vary greatly in\r\nstructure as well as in composition, in some the grains being rounded\r\nwhile in others they are sharply angular.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic structure of sandstone is shown in figure 7.[24]\r\n\r\nThe material by which the individual grains of a sandstone are bound\r\ntogether is usually the material of some of the other classes. The\r\ncalcareous, ferruginous, and siliceous cements being the chief ones.\r\nThis cementing substance is deposited among the granules forming the\r\nsandstone by percolating water.\r\n\r\nThe colors of sandstone are dependent usually upon iron oxids.\r\nEspecially is this true of the red, brown, and yellow colors. In some of\r\nthe light grey varieties, the color is that of the minerals comprising\r\nthe stone. Some of the darker colored sandstones contain organic matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.\r\n\r\n  Microscopic Structure of Sandstone.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the argillaceous group are composed essentially of a\r\nhydrous silicate of alumina, which is the basis of common clay, and\r\nvarying amounts of free silica, oxids of iron and manganese, carbonates\r\nof lime and magnesia, and small quantities of organic matter. They may\r\nhave originated _in situ_ from the decomposition of feldspars or as\r\ndeposits of fine mud or silt at the bottom of large bodies of water. The\r\nolder formations of these rocks are known as shales, argillites, and\r\nslates and the fissile structure which enables this to be split into\r\nthin sheets is probably due to the conditions under which they have been\r\nformed and not to any properties of the clays themselves.\r\n\r\nOne of the purest forms of this rock is kaolin, which is almost a pure\r\nhydrous silicate of alumina formed from the decomposition of feldspathic\r\nrocks from which the alkalies, iron oxids and other soluble constituents\r\nhave been removed by water.\r\n\r\nUnder the volcanic group are included the materials ejected from\r\nvolcanic vents in a more or less finely comminuted condition and which\r\nthrough the drifting power of atmospheric currents may be scattered over\r\nmany miles of territory. Various names are applied to such products,\r\nnames dependent in large part upon their state of subdivision. Volcanic\r\ndust and sand, or ashes, includes the finer dust-like or sand-like\r\nmaterials, and lapilli, or rapilli the coarser. The general name tuff\r\nincludes the more or less compacted and stratified beds of this\r\nmaterial, while trass, peperino, and pozzuolano are local varietal names\r\ngiven to similar materials occurring in European volcanic regions.\r\n\r\nThe second division, namely sedimentary rocks composed of the débris of\r\nplant and animal life includes many forms of great agricultural\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe first subdivision of this group is the infusorial or diatomaceous\r\nearth. It forms a fine white or yellowish pulverulent rock composed\r\nmainly of minute shells, or tests of diatoms, and is often so soft and\r\npliable as to crumble readily between the thumb and fingers. According\r\nto Whitney the beds are of comparatively limited extent and for this\r\nreason are of little agricultural value, although the weathering of this\r\ndiatomaceous material gives rise to a light yellow clay forming very\r\nfertile agricultural lands.\r\n\r\nThe second subdivision of this group includes the rocks of a calcareous\r\nnature derived from animal life; that is to say, what are properly\r\ncalled limestones. They vary in color, structure, and texture almost\r\nindefinitely, and include all possible grades of materials from those\r\nwhich can be used only as a flux, or for lime burning, through ordinary\r\nbuilding materials to the finest marbles. These rocks are world-wide in\r\ntheir distribution and limited to no one particular geologic horizon,\r\nbut are found in stratified beds among rocks of all ages from the most\r\nancient to the most recent.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that their chief constituent, carbonate of lime, is\r\nsoluble in ordinary meteoric waters, the rocks have undergone extensive\r\ndecomposition, their lime being removed, while their less soluble\r\nconstituents or impurities remain to form soil. A single ton of residual\r\nsoil represents not infrequently a loss of 100 tons of original rock\r\nmatter. As this mass of lime carbonate is removed by solution the\r\nresidual soil settles, and as the limestone rocks are more soluble than\r\nthe adjacent rock formations limestone formations usually form valley\r\nlands with ridges on either side. Caves are frequently found in such\r\nformations. Furthermore, as the lime is almost all in the form of the\r\neasily soluble lime carbonate it can be very completely removed and the\r\nfertile “limestone soils” are often very deficient in lime and respond\r\nreadily to an application of burnt lime, which, not infrequently, is\r\nquarried from the same field. From an agricultural standpoint this group\r\nis of very great interest and importance.\r\n\r\nThe third subdivision of this group, namely, that of vegetable origin,\r\nincludes peat, lignite, coals, etc. Rocks of this group are made up of\r\nmore or less fragmental remains of plants. In many of them, as the peats\r\nand lignites, the traces of plant structure are still apparent. In\r\nothers, as the anthracite coals, these structures have been wholly\r\nobliterated by metamorphisms.\r\n\r\nPlants when decomposing on the surface of the ground give off their\r\ncarbon to the atmosphere in the shape of carbon dioxid gas leaving only\r\nthe strictly inorganic or mineral matter behind. When, however, they are\r\nprotected from the oxidizing influence of the air, by water or by other\r\nplant growth, decomposition is greatly retarded, and a large portion of\r\nthe carbonaceous and volatile matters is retained, and by this means\r\ntogether with pressure from the overlying mass, the material becomes\r\nslowly converted into coal. When this process goes on near the surface\r\nof the earth, and without much pressure, peat or muck is the product.\r\n\r\nThe fourth subdivision of this group, the phosphatic, forms a class of\r\nrocks limited in extent but of the greatest economic importance. Guano,\r\ncoprolites, and phosphatic rocks (the phosphorites) come under this\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n=34. Aeolian Rocks.=—This class of rocks is of less importance than the\r\nothers, either geologically or agriculturally. It is formed from\r\nmaterials drifted by the winds and this material has various degrees of\r\ncompactness. Usually the components of these drifts form rocks or\r\ndeposits of a friable texture and of a fragmental nature. The very\r\nextensive deposits of loess in China, forming their most fertile lands,\r\nare admitted now to have been formed in this way, but it is now\r\ngenerally admitted that similar deposits in this country are of\r\nsubaqueous origin.\r\n\r\nChief among these rocks, are the volcanic ashes which are often carried\r\nto a long distance by the wind before they are deposited and\r\nconsolidated into rock masses. Many loose soils may be carried to great\r\ndistances by the wind, the deposits forming new aggregates. This is\r\nparticularly the case in arid regions.\r\n\r\n=35. Metamorphic Rocks.=—This class of rocks includes all sedimentary or\r\neruptive rocks, which, after their deposition and agglomeration, have\r\nbeen changed in their nature through the action of heat, pressure, or by\r\nchemical means. Sometimes these changes are so complete that no\r\nindication of the character of the original rocks remains. At other\r\ntimes the changes may be found in all the stages of progress, so that\r\nthey can be traced from the original fragmental or irruptive to the\r\ncompletely metamorphosed deposit. This is especially true of rocks\r\ncontaining large quantities of lime. In those containing silica, the\r\nchanges are less readily traced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.\r\n\r\n  MICROSTRUCTURE OF CRYSTALLINE LIMESTONE.\r\n\r\n  (West Rutland, Vermont.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic rocks may be divided into two subclasses, namely,\r\nstratified or bedded, and foliated or schistose.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the first class are represented by the crystalline\r\nlimestones and dolomites. The microstructure of a crystalline limestone\r\nis shown in Fig. 8.[25] When lime and magnesia occur together in\r\ncombination with carbon dioxid, the substance is known as dolomite. The\r\nchemical nature of these rocks and their soil-forming properties are the\r\nsame as those of the ordinary, non-metamorphosed limestones and\r\ndolomites to which reference has already been made. The subject need\r\nnot, therefore, be further dwelt upon here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.\r\n\r\n  MICROSTRUCTURE OF GNEISS.\r\n\r\n  (West Andover, Massachusetts.)\r\n\r\n  At _a a_ are shown plagioclase crystals broken and rounded by the\r\n    sheering force producing the foliation.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe second variety of metamorphic rocks is represented by the gneisses\r\nand crystalline schists. Gneiss has essentially the same composition as\r\ngranite and can frequently hardly be distinguished from it, except by a\r\nmicroscopic study of its sections, and even thus it is sometimes\r\ndifficult to determine. Frequently a number of new minerals is formed in\r\nthe metamorphic changes. The microstructure of a gneiss is shown in Fig.\r\n9.[26] The schists include an extremely variable class of rocks, of\r\nwhich quartz is the prevailing constituent, and which, as a rule, are\r\ndeficient in potash and other important ingredients.\r\n\r\n=36. Rocks Formed Through Igneous Agencies, or Eruptive Rocks.=—This\r\ngroup includes all those rocks, which, having been at some time in a\r\nstate of igneous fusion, have been solidified into their present form by\r\na process of cooling. It may be stated, as a general principle, that the\r\ngreater the pressure under which a rock solidifies and the slower and\r\nmore gradual the cooling the more perfect will be found the crystalline\r\nstructure. Hence, it follows that the older and more deep-seated rocks\r\nwhich are forced up in the form of dikes, bosses, or intrusive sheets,\r\ninto the overlying masses, and which have become exposed only through\r\nerosion and removal of the overlying rocks, are the more highly\r\ncrystalline.\r\n\r\nThe eruptive rocks are divided into two main groups, _viz._:\r\n\r\n(a) Intrusive or plutonic rocks, and\r\n\r\n(b) Effusive or volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nAmong the more important of the first division of the plutonic form,\r\nfrom an agricultural point of view, are the granites. The essential\r\nconstituents of granite are quartz, potash feldspar, and plagioclase.\r\nOne or more minerals of the mica, amphibole or pyroxene groups are also\r\ncommonly present, and in microscopic proportions apatite and particles\r\nof magnetic iron. The more valuable constituents, from an agricultural\r\nstandpoint, are the minerals potash feldspar, and apatite, which furnish\r\nby their decomposition the essential potash and phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the granites, which have already been mentioned, the\r\ngroup includes the syenites, the nepheline syenites, the diorites, the\r\ngabbros, the diabases, the theralites, the peridotites, and the\r\npyroxenites.\r\n\r\nThe second group, the effusive or volcanic rocks, includes those igneous\r\nrocks, which, like the first group, have been forced up through the\r\noverlying rocks, but which were brought to the surface, flowing out as\r\nlavas. These, therefore, represent, in many cases, only the upper or\r\nsurface portions of the first group, differing from them structurally,\r\nbecause they have cooled under little pressure more rapidly, and hence\r\nare not so distinctly crystalline. These comprise the following groups:\r\n\r\n      (a) Quartz porphyries. (b) Liparites. (c) Quartz-free porphyries.\r\n        (d) Trachytes. (e) Phonolites. (f) Porphyrites. (g) Andesites.\r\n        (h) Melaphyrs and augite porphyrites. (i) Basalts. (j) Tephrites\r\n        and Basanites. (k) Picrite porphyrites. (l) Limburgites and\r\n        augitites. (m) Leucite rocks. (n) Nepheline rocks. (o) Melilite\r\n        rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is, in most cases, impossible to state which of the above classes is\r\nof most importance from an agricultural standpoint, since, in the\r\nprocess of soil formation, both chemical and physical processes are\r\ninvolved, whereby the character of the resultant soil is so modified as\r\nto but remotely resemble its parent rock. In most soils, the prevailing\r\nconstituent is but the least soluble one of the rock mass from which it\r\nwas derived. Thus a limestone soil may contain upwards of ninety per\r\ncent of silica and alumina, while the original limestone itself may not\r\nhave carried more than one or two per cent of these substances. Of\r\ncourse, if a rock mass contains none of the constituents essential to\r\nplant growth, its resultant soil must by itself alone be quite barren.\r\nIt does not absolutely follow, however, that those rocks containing the\r\nhighest percentages of valuable constituents will yield the most fertile\r\nsoils, since much depends on the manner in which they have been formed,\r\nthe amount of leaching, etc., they may have undergone. Nevertheless, the\r\nstudy of the composition of the rocks in their relation to soils, is an\r\nextremely interesting and by no means unimportant one.\r\n\r\nA comparative table of rock compositions is here given. It will be\r\nobserved that there is a considerable range of variation even among\r\nrocks of the same class, a fact due to the varying abundance of their\r\nmineral constituents. The figures given are not those of actual analyses\r\non any one particular rock, but are selected from a number of\r\ncomparatively typical cases; and, it is thought, fairly well represent\r\nthe composition of the class of rocks indicated.\r\n\r\n     COMPOSITION OF ROCKS.—THE FIGURES INDICATE PARTS PER HUNDRED.\r\n\r\n ──────────────────────┬────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────\r\n                       │ SiO₂.  │   Al₂O₃.   │   Fe₂O₃.   │  MgO.\r\n                       │        │            │    FeO.    │\r\n ──────────────────────┼────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────\r\n Granite               │        │            │            │\r\n Quartz poryhyries}    │ 63–78  │   10–15    │    2–3     │0.3–0.5\r\n Liparite              │        │            │            │\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Syenite               │        │            │            │\r\n Orthoclase porphyries}│ 55–73  │   12–16    │    5–7     │  2–6\r\n Trachyte              │        │            │            │\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Nepheline syenites}   │ 54–56  │   16–22    │    4–6     │0.4–0.88\r\n Phonolites            │        │            │            │\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Diorites              │        │            │            │\r\n Porphyrites}          │ 52–65  │   16–20    │    7–10    │  5–7\r\n Andesites             │        │            │            │\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Gabbros               │        │            │            │\r\n Norites}              │ 48–55  │   12–20    │    8–15    │  2–7\r\n Melaphyrs             │        │            │            │\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Theralites            │        │            │            │\r\n Tephrites}            │ 43–47  │   15–23    │    9–18    │  1–6\r\n Basanites             │        │            │            │\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Peridotites           │        │            │            │\r\n Picrite porphyrites}  │ 23–43  │    1–10    │   10–15    │ 15–45\r\n Limburgites           │        │            │            │\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Pyroxenites}          │ 50–55  │   0.5–4    │    4–10    │ 20–25\r\n Augitites             │        │            │            │\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Leucite rocks         │ 48–50  │   15–20    │    7–10    │  1–2\r\n                       │        │            │            │\r\n Nepheline rocks       │ 40–45  │    8–20    │   10–20    │  1–13\r\n ──────────────────────┴────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────\r\n\r\n ──────────────────────┬─────┬────────┬───────┬───────────\r\n                       │CaO. │  Na₂O. │  K₂O. │P₂O₅.\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n ──────────────────────┼─────┼────────┼───────┼───────────\r\n Granite               │     │        │       │\r\n Quartz poryhyries}    │ 1–2 │  2–3   │  4–5  │ 0.05–0.15\r\n Liparite              │     │        │       │\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Syenite               │     │        │       │\r\n Orthoclase porphyries}│ 3–5 │  2–6   │  4–7  │  trace.\r\n Trachyte              │     │        │       │\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Nepheline syenites}   │ 2–4 │  3–7   │  4–6  │   0.15\r\n Phonolites            │     │        │       │\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Diorites              │     │        │       │\r\n Porphyrites}          │ 5–7 │  2–4   │  1–2  │  0.1–0.3\r\n Andesites             │     │        │       │\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Gabbros               │     │        │       │\r\n Norites}              │6–10 │  2–4   │ 0.5–2 │ 0.1–0.33\r\n Melaphyrs             │     │        │       │\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Theralites            │     │        │       │\r\n Tephrites}            │6–10 │  5–7   │  2–4  │  trace.\r\n Basanites             │     │        │       │\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Peridotites           │     │        │       │\r\n Picrite porphyrites}  │ 1–4 │  0–4   │trace. │    0.0\r\n Limburgites           │     │        │       │\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Pyroxenites}          │8–15 │        │       │\r\n Augitites             │     │        │       │\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Leucite rocks         │5–10 │  3–5   │  5–7  │   0.5–2\r\n                       │     │        │       │\r\n Nepheline rocks       │4–10 │  4–8   │  1–3  │    0.2\r\n ──────────────────────┴─────┴────────┴───────┴───────────\r\n\r\n=37. Origin of Soils.=—The soils in which crops grow and which form the\r\nsubject of the analytical processes to be hereinafter described have\r\nbeen formed under the combined influences of rock decay and plant and\r\norganic growth. The mineral matters of soils have had their origin in\r\nthe decay of rocks, while the humic and other organic constituents have\r\nbeen derived from living bodies. It is not the object of this treatise\r\nto discuss in detail the processes of soil formation, but only to give\r\nsuch general outlines as may bear particularly on the proper conceptions\r\nof the principles of soil investigation.\r\n\r\n=38. The Decay of Rocks.=—The origin and composition of rocks are fully\r\nset forth in works on geology and mineralogy. Only a brief summary of\r\nthose points of interest to agriculture has been given in the preceding\r\npages. The soil analyst should be acquainted with these principles, but\r\nfor practical purposes he has only to understand the chief factors\r\nactive in securing the decay of rocks and in preparing the débris for\r\nplant growth.\r\n\r\nThe following outline is based on the generally accepted theories\r\nrespecting the formation of soils.[7]\r\n\r\nThe forces ordinarily concerned in the decay of rocks are:\r\n\r\n      1. Changes of temperature, including the ordinary daily and\r\n        monthly changes, and the conditions of freezing and thawing.\r\n\r\n      2. Moving water or ice.\r\n\r\n      3. Chemical action of water and air.\r\n\r\n      4. Influence of vegetable and animal life:\r\n\r\n      (a) Shades the rock or soil surface.\r\n\r\n      (b) Penetrates the rock or soil material with its roots, thus\r\n        admitting air.\r\n\r\n      (c) Solvent action of roots.\r\n\r\n      (d) Chemical action of decaying organic matter.\r\n\r\n      5. Earth worms.\r\n\r\n      6. Bacteria.\r\n\r\n=39. The Action of Freezing and Thawing.=—In those parts of a rock\r\nstratum exposed near the surface of the earth the processes of freezing\r\nand thawing have perhaps had considerable influence in rock decay. The\r\nexpansive force of freezing water is well known. Ice occupies a larger\r\nvolume than the water from which it was formed. The force with which\r\nthis expansion takes place is almost irresistible. The phenomenon of\r\nbursted water pipes which have been exposed to a freezing temperature is\r\nnot an uncommon one. While the increase in volume is not large, yet it\r\nis entirely sufficient to produce serious results. The way in which\r\nfreezing affects exposed rock is easily understood. The effect is\r\nunnoticeable if the rock be dry. If, on the other hand, it be saturated\r\nwith water, the disintegrating effect of a freeze must be of\r\nconsiderable magnitude. This effect becomes more pronounced if the\r\nintervals of freezing and thawing be of short duration. The whole\r\naffected portion of the rock may thus become thoroughly decayed. But\r\neven in the most favorable conditions this form of disintegration must\r\nbe confined to a thin superficial area. Even in very cold climates the\r\nfrost only penetrates a few feet below the surface, and therefore the\r\naction of ice cannot in any way be connected with those changes at great\r\ndepths, to which attention has already been called. Nevertheless,\r\ncertain building stones seem very sensitive to this sort of weathering,\r\nand the crumbling of the stone in the Houses of Parliament is due\r\nchiefly to this cause.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it appears that the action of ice in producing rock decay\r\nhas been somewhat overrated, although its power must not by any means be\r\ndenied. But on the other hand a freeze extending over a long time tends\r\nto preserve the rocks, and it therefore appears that the entire absence\r\nof frost would promote the process of rock decay.\r\n\r\nAt best it must be admitted that frost has affected the earth’s crust\r\nonly to an insignificant depth, but its influence in modifying the\r\narable part of the soil is of the utmost importance to agriculture.\r\n\r\n=40. The Action of Glaciers.=—The action of ice in soil formation is not\r\nconfined alone to the processes just described. At a period not very\r\nremote geologically, a great part of our Northern States was covered\r\nwith a vast field of moving ice. These seas of ice crept down upon us\r\nfrom more northern latitudes and swept before them every vestige of\r\nanimal and vegetable life. In their movement they leveled and destroyed\r\nthe crests of hills and filled the valleys with the débris. They crushed\r\nand comminuted the strata of rocks which opposed their flow and carried\r\nhuge boulders of granite hundreds of miles from their homes. On melting\r\nthey left vast moraines of rocks and pebbles which will mark for all\r\ntime the termini of these empires of ice. When the ice of these vast\r\nglaciers finally melted the surface which they had leveled presented the\r\nappearance of an extended plain. No estimate can be made of the enormous\r\nquantities of rock material which were ground to finest powder by these\r\nglaciers. This rock powder forms to-day no inconsiderable part of those\r\nfertile soils which are composed of glacial drift. The rich materials of\r\nthese soils probably bear a more intimate relation to the rocks from\r\nwhich they were formed than of any other kinds of soil in the world. The\r\nrocks were literally ground into a fine powder, and this powder was\r\nintimately mixed with the soils which had already been formed _in situ_.\r\nThe melting ice also left exposed to disintegrating forces large\r\nsurfaces of unprotected rocks in which decay would go on much more\r\nrapidly than when covered with the débris which protected them before\r\nthe advent of the ice. The area of glacial action extended over nearly\r\nall of New England and over the whole area of the northern tier of\r\nStates. It extended southward almost to the Ohio river, and in some\r\nplaces crossed it. The effect of the ice age in producing and modifying\r\nour soil must never be forgotten in a study of soil genesis. It is not a\r\npart of our purpose here to study the causes which produced the age of\r\nice. Even a brief reference to some of the more probable ones might be\r\nentirely out of place. Before the glacial period it is certain that a\r\ntropical climate extended almost, if not quite, to the North Pole. The\r\nfossil remains of tropical plants and animals which have been found in\r\nhigh northern latitudes are abundant proofs of this fact.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of Sterry Hunt,[27] rock decay has taken place largely in\r\npreglacial and pretertiary times. The decay of crystalline rocks is a\r\nprocess of great antiquity. It is also a universal phenomenon. The fact\r\nthat the rocks of the southern part of this country seem to be covered\r\nwith a deeper débris than those further north is probably due to the\r\nmechanical translation of the eroded particles towards the south. The\r\ndecay and softening of the material were processes necessarily preceding\r\nthe erosion by aqueous and glacial action.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that a climate may have existed in the earlier geologic\r\nages more favorable to the decay of rocks than that of the present time.\r\n\r\n=41. Progress of Decay as Affected by Latitude.=—Extensive\r\ninvestigations carried on along the Atlantic side of the country show\r\nwide differences in the rate of decay in the same kind of rocks in\r\ndifferent latitudes. In general, the progress of decay is more marked\r\ntoward the south. The same fact is observed in the great interior\r\nvalleys of the country; at least, everywhere except in the arid and\r\nsemi-arid regions. Wherever there is a deficiency of water the processes\r\nof decay have been arrested. Where the rock strata have been displaced\r\nfrom a horizontal position the progress of decay has been more rapid.\r\nThis is easily understood. The percolation of water is more easy as the\r\ndisplacement approaches a vertical position.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable example of this is seen in the rocks of North\r\nCarolina.[28] A kind of rock known as trap is found in layers called\r\ndikes in the Newark system of rocks in that State. These dikes have been\r\nso completely displaced from the horizontal position they at first\r\noccupied as to have an almost vertical dip. The edges thus exposed vary\r\nfrom a few feet to nearly 100 feet in thickness. The trap rock in those\r\nlocalities is composed almost exclusively of the mineral dolerite, which\r\nis so hard and elastic in a fresh state as to ring like a piece of metal\r\nwhen struck with a hammer. In building a railroad through this region\r\nthese dikes were in some places uncovered to a depth of forty feet and\r\nmore. At this depth they were found completely decomposed and with no\r\nindications of having reached the lower limit of disintegration. The\r\noriginal hard bluish dolerite has been transformed into a yellowish\r\nclay-like mass that can be molded in the fingers and cut like putty.\r\nSimilar geologic formations in New Jersey and further North do not\r\nexhibit anything like so great a degree of decomposition, thus\r\nillustrating in a marked degree the fact that freezing weather for a\r\npart of the year is a protection against rock decay. The ice of winter\r\nat least protects the rocks from surface infiltration, although it can\r\nnot stop the subterranean solution which must go on continuously.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, therefore, it appears that as the region of\r\nwinter frost is passed the decay of the rocks has been more rapid than\r\nin the North, because the chief disintegrating forces act more\r\nconstantly.\r\n\r\n=42. The Solvent Action of Water.=—The water of springs and wells is not\r\npure. It contains in solution mineral matters and often a trace of\r\norganic matter. The organic matter comes from contact with vegetable\r\nmatter and other organic materials near the surface of the earth. The\r\nmineral matter is derived from the solvent action of the water and its\r\ncontents on the soil and rocks.\r\n\r\nThe expressions “hard” and “soft” applied to water indicate that it has\r\nmuch or little mineral matter in suspension, as the case may be. When\r\nsurface and spring waters are collected into streams and rivers they\r\nstill contain in solution the greater part of the mineral matters which\r\nthey at first carried.\r\n\r\nWhen well or spring waters have more than forty grains of mineral matter\r\nper gallon they are not suitable for drinking waters. Mineral waters, so\r\ncalled, are those which carry large quantities of mineral matter, or\r\nwhich contain certain comparatively rare mineral substances which are\r\nvalued for their medicinal effects.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of spring, well, or river waters will always give some\r\nindication of the character of the rocks over which they have\r\npassed.[29] The vast quantities of mineral matters carried into oceans\r\nand seas are gradually deposited as the water is evaporated. If,\r\nhowever, these matters be very soluble, such as common salt, sulfate of\r\nmagnesia, etc., they become concentrated, as is seen with common salt in\r\nsea waters. In small bodies of waters, such as inland seas, which have\r\nno outlet, this concentration may proceed to a much greater extent than\r\nin the ocean. As an instance of this, it may be noted that the waters of\r\nthe Dead Sea and Great Salt Lake are impregnated to a far greater degree\r\nwith soluble salts than the water of the ocean. The solvent action of\r\nwater on rocks is greatly increased by the traces of organic or carbonic\r\nacids which it may contain. When surface water comes in contact with\r\nvegetable matter it may become partially charged with the organic acids\r\nwhich the growing vegetable may contain or decaying vegetable matter\r\nproduce. Such acids coming in contact with limestone under pressure will\r\nset free carbon dioxid. Water charged with carbon dioxid acts vigorously\r\non limestone and other mineral aggregates. If such solutions penetrate\r\ndeeply below the surface of the earth their activity as solvents may be\r\ngreatly increased by the higher temperature to which they are subjected.\r\nHence, all these forces combine to disintegrate the rocks, and through\r\nsuch agencies vast deposits of original and secondary rocks have been\r\ncompletely decomposed.\r\n\r\nThe gradual passing of the firm rock into an arable soil is beautifully\r\nshown in Fig. 10, a print from a negative taken by Mr. Geo. P. Merrill,\r\nnear Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 10.\r\n\r\n  View on the Broad Branch of Rock Creek, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n  The fresh but badly decomposed granitic rock is shown passing upward\r\n    into material more and more decomposed until it becomes sufficiently\r\n    pulverulent and soluble to support plant life. The roots showing in\r\n    the upper part of the picture formerly penetrated the decomposed\r\n    rock, but have been exposed through quarrying operations. Photograph\r\n    by George P. Merrill, 1891.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=43. Action Of Vegetable Life.=—The preliminary condition to vegetation\r\nis the formation of soil, but once started, vegetation aids greatly in\r\nthe decomposition of rocks. Some forms of vegetation, as the lichens,\r\nhave apparently the faculty of growing on the bare surface of rocks, but\r\nthe higher order requires at least a little soil. The vegetation acts by\r\nshading the surface and thus rendering the action of water more\r\neffective, by mechanically separating the rock particles by means of its\r\npenetrating roots and by the positive solvent action of the root juices.\r\nThe rootlets of plants in contact with limestone or marble dissolve\r\nlarge portions of these substances, and while their action on more\r\nrefractory rocks is slower, it must be of considerable importance. The\r\norganic matter introduced into the soil by vegetation also promotes\r\ndecay still further both directly and by the formation of acids of the\r\nhumic series. This matter also furnishes a considerable portion of\r\ncarbon dioxid which is carried by the water to assist in its solvent\r\naction.\r\n\r\n=44. Action of Earth-Worms.=—Of animal organisms those most active in\r\nthe formation of soil are earth-worms. The work of earth-worms has been\r\nexhaustively studied by Darwin.[30] The worms not only modify the soil\r\nby bringing to the surface portions of the subsoil, but also influence\r\nits physical state by making it more porous and pulverulent. According\r\nto Darwin the intestinal content of worms has an acid reaction, and this\r\nhas an effect on those portions of the soil passing through their\r\nalimentary canal. The acids, which are formed in the upper part of the\r\ndigestive canal are neutralized by the carbonate of lime secreted by the\r\ncalciferous glands of the worms thus neutralizing the free acid and\r\nchanging the reaction to alkaline in the lower part of the canal. There\r\nis a fair presumption that the acids of the worm are of a humic nature.\r\n\r\nThe worms further modify the composition of the soil by drawing leaves\r\nand other organic matter into their holes, and leaving therein a portion\r\nof such matter which is gradually converted into humus. Stockbridge[31]\r\ngives a striking illustration of this process due to an experiment by\r\nvon Hensen. Darwin estimates that about eleven tons of organic matter\r\nper acre are annually added to the soil in regions where worms abound. A\r\nconsiderable portion of the ammonia in the soil at any given time may\r\nalso be due to the action of worms, as much as 0.18 per cent of this\r\nsubstance having been found in their excrement. It is probable that\r\nnearly the whole of the vegetable matter in the soil passes sooner or\r\nlater through the alimentary canals of these ceaseless soil builders,\r\nand is converted into the form of humus.\r\n\r\n=45. Action of Bacteria.=—The intimate relations which have been found\r\nto subsist between certain minute organisms and the chemical reactions\r\nwhich take place in the soil is a sufficient excuse for noting the\r\neffect of other similar organisms in the formation of soils.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual forces active in decomposing rocks Müntz[32]\r\nhas described the effects of a nitrifying bacillus contributing to the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nAccording to him the bare rock usually furnishes a purely mineral\r\nenvironment where organisms cannot be developed unless they are able to\r\ndraw their nourishment directly from the air. Some nitrifying organisms\r\nbelong to this class. It has been shown that these bodies can be\r\ndeveloped by absorbing from the ambient atmosphere carbonate of ammonia\r\nand vapors of alcohol, the presence of which has been determined in the\r\nair. According to the observations of Winogradsky, they assimilate even\r\nthe carbon of the carbon dioxid just as vegetables do which contain\r\nchlorophyl. Thus even in the denuded rocks of high mountains the\r\nconditions for the development of all these inferior organisms exist. In\r\nexamining the particles produced by attrition, it is easily established\r\nthat they are uniformly covered by a layer of organic matter evidently\r\nformed by microscopic vegetations. Thus we see, in the very first\r\nproducts of attrition, appearing upon the rocky particles the\r\ncharacteristic element of vegetable soil, viz., humus, the proportion of\r\nwhich increases rapidly with the products of disaggregation collected at\r\nthe foot of declivities until finally they become covered with\r\nchlorophyliferous plants.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner the presence of nitrifying organisms has been noted\r\nupon rocky particles received in sterilized tubes, and cultivated in an\r\nappropriate environment where they soon produce nitrification. The naked\r\nrocks of the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Auvergnes and the Vosges, comprise\r\nmineralogical types of the most varied nature, _viz._, granite,\r\nporphyry, gneiss, micaschist volcanic rocks and limestones and all these\r\nhave shown themselves to be covered with the nitrifying ferment. It is\r\nknown that below a certain temperature these organisms are not active;\r\ntheir action upon the rock is, therefore, limited to the summer period.\r\nDuring the cold season their life is suspended but they do not perish,\r\ninasmuch as they have been found living and ready to resume all their\r\nactivity after an indefinite sleep on the ice of the glaciers where the\r\ntemperature is never elevated above zero.\r\n\r\nThe nitrifying ferment is exercised on a much larger scale in the normal\r\nconditions of the lower levels where the rock is covered with earth.\r\nThis activity is not limited to the mass of rock but is continued upon\r\nthe fragments of the most diverse size scattered through the soil and it\r\ngradually reduces them to a state of fine particles. It is therefore a\r\nphenomenon of the widest extension.\r\n\r\nThe action of these micro-organisms according to Müntz is not confined\r\nto the surface but extends to the most interior particles of the rocky\r\nmass. Where, however, there is nothing of a nitrogenous nature, to\r\nnitrify such an organism must live in a state of suspended animation.\r\n\r\nWhen the extreme minuteness of these phenomena is considered there may\r\nbe a tendency to despise their importance, but their continuity and\r\ntheir generality in the opinion of Müntz place them among the geologic\r\ncauses to which the crust of the earth owes a part of its actual\r\nphysiognomy and which particularly have contributed to the formation of\r\nthe deposits of the comminuted elements constituting arable soil.\r\n\r\nThe general action of nitrifying organisms in the soil, the nature of\r\nthese bodies, and the method of isolating and identifying them will be\r\nfully discussed in another part of this work.\r\n\r\n=46. Action of the Air.=—The air itself takes an active part in rock\r\ndecay. Wherever rocks are exposed to decay, there air is found or, at\r\nleast, the active principle of air, _viz._, oxygen. The air not only\r\npenetrates to a great depth in the earth, but is also carried to much\r\ngreater depths by water which always holds a greater or less quantity of\r\nair in solution. The oxygen of the air is thus brought into intimate\r\ncontact with the disintegrating materials and in a condition to assist\r\nwherever possible in the decomposing processes.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen acts vigorously on the lower oxids of iron, converting them\r\ninto peroxids, and thus tends to produce decay.\r\n\r\nThere are other constituents of rocks which oxygen affects injuriously\r\nand thus helps to their final breaking up. It is true that, as a rule,\r\nthe constituents of rocks are already oxidized to nearly as high a\r\ndegree as possible, and on these constituents of course the air would\r\nhave no effect. But on others, especially when helped by water with the\r\nother substances it carries in solution, the air may greatly help in the\r\nwork of destruction.\r\n\r\nIn a general view, the action of the air in soil formation may be\r\nregarded as of secondary importance, and to depend chiefly on the\r\noxidation of the lower to the higher basic forms. These processes, while\r\nthey seem of little value, have, nevertheless, been of considerable\r\nimportance in the production of that residue of rock disintegration\r\nwhich constitutes the soil.\r\n\r\n=47. Classification of Soils According to Deposition.=—In regard to\r\ntheir deposition soils are divided into five classes:\r\n\r\n1. Those which are formed from the decomposition of crystalline or\r\nsedimentary rocks or of unconsolidated sedimentary material _in situ_.\r\n\r\n2. Those which have been moved by water from the place of their original\r\nformation and deposited by subsidence (bottom lands, alluvial soils,\r\nlacustrine deposits, etc.).\r\n\r\n3. Those which have been deposited as débris from moving masses of ice\r\n(glacial drift).\r\n\r\n4. Soils formed from volcanic ashes or from materials moved by the wind\r\nand deposited in low places or in hills or ridges.\r\n\r\n5. Those formed chiefly from the decay of vegetable matter, (tule, peat,\r\nmuck).\r\n\r\n=48. Qualities of Soils.=—In respect of quality, soils have been\r\narbitrarily divided into many kinds. Some of the more important of these\r\ndivisions are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Sand._ Soils consisting almost exclusively of sand.\r\n\r\n2. _Sandy Loams._ Soils containing some humus and clay but an excess of\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n3. _Loams._ Soils inclining neither to sand nor clay and containing some\r\nconsiderable portions of vegetable mold, being very pulverulent and\r\neasily broken up into loose and porous masses.\r\n\r\n4. _Clays._ Stiff soils in which the silicate of alumina and other fine\r\nmineral particles are present in large quantity.\r\n\r\n5. _Marls._ Deposits containing an unusual proportion of carbonate of\r\nlime, with often some potash or phosphoric acid resulting from the\r\nremains of sea-animals and plants.\r\n\r\n6. _Alkaline._ Soils containing carbonate and sulfate of soda, or an\r\nexcess of these alkaline and other soluble mineral substances.\r\n\r\n7. _Adobe._ A fine grained porous earth of peculiar properties\r\nhereinafter described.\r\n\r\n8. _Vegetable._ Soils containing much vegetable débris in an advanced\r\nstate of decomposition. When such matter predominates or exists in large\r\nproportion in a soil the term tule, peat or muck is applied to it.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of numbers six, seven and eight these types of soil\r\nare so well-known as to require no further description for analytical\r\npurposes. The alkaline, adobe and vegetable soils on the contrary demand\r\nfurther study.\r\n\r\n=49. Alkaline Soils.=—The importance of a more extended notice of this\r\nclass of soils for analytical purposes is emphasized by their large\r\nextent in the United States.\r\n\r\nChiefly through the researches of Hilgard attention has been called to\r\nthe true character of these soils which are found throughout a large\r\npart of the Western United States and which are known by the common name\r\nof alkali. The following description of the origin of these soils is\r\ncompiled chiefly from Hilgard’s papers on this subject. Wherever the\r\nrain-fall is scanty, and especially where the rains do not come at any\r\none time with sufficient force to thoroughly saturate the soil and carry\r\ndown through the subsoil and off through the drainage waters the alkali\r\ncontained therein, favorable conditions exist for the production of the\r\nalkaline soil mentioned above. The peculiar characteristic of this soil\r\nis the efflorescence which occurs upon its surface and which is due to\r\nthe raising of soluble salts in the soil by the water rising through\r\ncapillary attraction and evaporating from the surface, leaving the salts\r\nas an efflorescence.\r\n\r\nSoils which contain a large amount of alkali are usually very rich in\r\nmineral plant food, and if the excess of soluble salt could be removed,\r\nthese lands under favorable conditions of moisture would produce large\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the alkali may be briefly described as follows: By the\r\ndecomposition of the native rocks, certain salts soluble in water are\r\nformed. These salts in the present matter are chiefly sodium and\r\npotassium sulfates, chlorids and carbonates. The salts of potash\r\ntogether with those of lime are more tenaciously held by the soil than\r\nthe soluble salts of soda, and the result of this natural affinity of\r\nthe soil for soluble potash, lime and magnesian salts is seen in the\r\nformation at the surface of the earth, by the process of evaporation\r\nabove described, of a crust of alkaline material which is chiefly\r\ncomposed of the soluble salts of soda. In countries which have a\r\nsufficient amount of rain-fall, these soluble salts are carried away\r\neither by the surface drainage or by the percolation of water through\r\nthe soil, and the sodium chlorid is accumulated in this way in the\r\nwaters of the ocean. But where a sufficient amount of rain-fall does not\r\noccur, these soluble salts carried down by each shower only to a certain\r\ndepth rise again on the evaporation of the water, reinforced by any\r\nadditional soluble material which may be found in the soil itself. The\r\nthree most important ingredients of the alkali of the lands referred to\r\nare sodium chlorid, sulfate, and carbonate. When the latter salt,\r\nnamely, sodium carbonate, is present in predominant quantity, it gives\r\nrise to what is popularly known as black alkali. This black color is due\r\nto the dark colored solution which sodium carbonate makes with the\r\norganic matters or humus of the soil. The black alkali is far more\r\ninjurious to growing vegetation than the white alkali composed chiefly\r\nof sodium sulfate and chlorid.\r\n\r\nThis black alkali has been very successfully treated by Hilgard[33] by\r\nthe application of gypsum which reacting with the sodium carbonate\r\nproduces calcium carbonate and sodium sulfate, thus converting the black\r\ninto the white alkali and adding an ingredient in the shape of lime\r\ncarbonate to stiff soils which tends to make them more pulverulent and\r\neasy of tillage.\r\n\r\nThis method of treatment, however, as can be easily seen, is only\r\npalliative, the whole amount of the alkaline substances being still left\r\nin the soil, only in a less injurious form.\r\n\r\nThe only perfect remedy for alkaline soils, as has been pointed out by\r\nHilgard, is in the introduction of underdrainage in connection with\r\nirrigation. The partial irrigation of alkaline soils, affording enough\r\nmoisture to carry the alkali down to and perhaps partially through the\r\nsubsoil, can produce only a temporary alleviation of the difficulties\r\nproduced by the alkali. Subsequent evaporation may thus increase the\r\namount of surface incrustation. For this reason in many cases the\r\npractice of irrigation without underdrainage may completely ruin an\r\notherwise fertile soil by slowly increasing the amount of alkali in the\r\nsoil by the total amount of the alkaline material added in the waters of\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nAs Hilgard has pointed out, if a soil can be practically freed from\r\nalkali by underdrainage connected with a thorough saturation by\r\nirrigation, it may be centuries before the alkali will accumulate in\r\nthat soil again when ordinary irrigation only is practiced. It may thus\r\nbecome possible to reclaim large extents of alkaline soil little by\r\nlittle by treating them with an excess of irrigation water in connection\r\nwith thorough underdrainage. The composition of the alkali on the\r\nsurface of the soil due to the causes above set forth is thoroughly\r\nillustrated by the analyses of Hilgard and Weber, which follow:\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING COMPOSITION OF ALKALI SALTS IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.\r\n\r\n ═════════════╤════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n              │               FRESNO COUNTY.\r\n ─────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n              │  Sections 13 and 24 T. 14 S.

Adobe Soils.=—In many parts of the arid regions of this country\r\nwhich can be recovered for agricultural purposes by irrigation the soil\r\nhas peculiar characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe name adobe as commonly used applies to both the sundried bricks of\r\nthe arid regions of the West and Southwest, and to the materials of\r\nwhich they are composed. The material is described by Russell[34] as a\r\nfine grained porous earth, varying in color through many shades of gray\r\nand yellow, which crumbles between the fingers, but separates most\r\nreadily in a vertical direction. The coherency of the material is so\r\ngreat that vertical scarps will stand for many years without forming a\r\nnoticeable talus slope.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._—The area over which adobe forms a large part of the\r\nsurface has not been accurately mapped, but enough is known to indicate\r\nthat it is essentially co-extensive with the more arid portions of this\r\ncountry. In a very general way it may be considered as being limited to\r\nthe region in which the mean annual rain-fall is less than twenty\r\ninches. It forms the surface over large portions of Colorado, New\r\nMexico, Western Texas, Arizona, Southern California, Nevada, Utah,\r\nSouthern Oregon, Southern Idaho, and Wyoming. Adobe occurs also in\r\nMexico and may there reach a greater development than in the United\r\nStates, but observations concerning it south of the Rio Grande are\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nIn the United States it occurs from near the sea-level in Arizona, and\r\neven below the sea-level in Southern California, up to an elevation of\r\nat least six or eight thousand feet, along the eastern border of the\r\nRocky Mountains, and in the elevated valleys of New Mexico, Colorado,\r\nand Wyoming. It occupies depressions of all sizes up to valleys having\r\nan area of hundreds of square miles. Although occurring throughout the\r\narid region, it can be studied to best advantage in the drainless and\r\nlakeless basins in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.\r\n\r\n_Composition._—When examined under the microscope, the adobe is seen to\r\nbe composed of irregular, unassorted flakes and grains, principally\r\nquartz, but fragments of other minerals are also present. An exhaustive\r\nmicroscopic study has not been made, but the samples examined from\r\nwidely-separated localities were very similar. The principal\r\ncharacteristics observed were the extreme angularity of the particles\r\ncomposing the deposit and the undecomposed condition of the various\r\nminerals entering into its composition. It is to be inferred from this\r\nthat the material was not exposed even to a very moderate degree of\r\nfriction, and had not undergone subaerial decay before being deposited.\r\nAdobe collected, at typical localities is so fine in texture that no\r\ngrit can be felt when it is rubbed between the fingers; in other\r\ninstances it contains angular rock fragments of appreciable size.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the material is illustrated by the following\r\nanalyses:\r\n\r\n                           ANALYSES OF ADOBE.\r\n\r\n                            BY L.

Vegetable Soils.=—The heavy soils whose origin has been described\r\nare essentially of a mineral nature. The quantity of organic matter in\r\nsuch soils may vary from a mere trace to a few per cent, but they never\r\nlose their mineral predominance. When a soil on the other hand is\r\ncomposed almost exclusively of vegetable mold it belongs to quite\r\nanother type. Such soils are called tule, peat or muck. In this country\r\nthere are thousands of acres of peat or muck soils; the largest\r\ncontiguous deposits being found in Southern Florida. The origin of these\r\nsoils is easily understood. Whenever rank vegetation grows in such a\r\nlocation as to secure for the organic matter formed a slow decay there\r\nis a tendency to the accumulation of vegetable mold in shallow water or\r\non marshy ground and where conditions are favorable to such\r\naccumulations. In Florida the muck soils have been accumulated about the\r\nmargins of lakes. During the rainy season the marshes bordering these\r\nare partly covered with water, but the vegetation is very luxuriant. The\r\nwater protects the vegetable matter from being destroyed by fire. It\r\ntherefore accumulates from year to year and is gradually compacted into\r\nquite a uniform mass of vegetable mold.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the muck is illustrated in the following table which\r\nshows the character of the layers at one, two and three feet in\r\ndepth:[35]\r\n\r\n             Carbon.        Hydrogen.       Nitrogen.       Volatile\r\n                                                             matter.\r\n 1 foot   57.67 per cent   4.48 per cent   2.24 per cent  90.60 per cent\r\n 2 feet   47.07    „       5.15    „       1.40    „      72.00    „\r\n 3 feet    8.52    „       0.53    „       0.31    „      15.00    „\r\n\r\nIn this sample, No. 3, the muck was only three feet deep, resting on\r\npure sand. As the bottom of the deposit is approached the admixture of\r\nsand becomes greater and the percentage of organic matter less.\r\n\r\nNo reliable estimate of the time which has been required to form these\r\ndeposits can be given, but in the Okeechobee region in Florida the\r\ndeposit of vegetable mold in some places exceeds ten feet in depth.\r\n\r\nThe purest muck or peat soils contain only small quantities of potash\r\nand phosphoric acid, and especially is this true of the Florida mucks\r\nwhich have been formed of vegetable growth containing very little\r\nmineral matter.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all probable that the flora now growing on any particular\r\narea of virgin peat contains all the plants that have contributed to its\r\nformation. The principal vegetable growths now going to make up the muck\r\nsoils of Florida are the following:\r\n\r\n                    Common names.    Botanical names.\r\n                  Saw grass         Cladium effusum\r\n                  Yellow pond lily  Nymphea flava\r\n                  Maiden cane grass Panicum Curtisii\r\n                  Alligator Wampee  Pontederia cordata\r\n                  Sedge             Cyperus  species\r\n                  Fern brake        Osmunda     „\r\n                  Mallow            Malva       „\r\n                  Broom sedge       Andropogon  „\r\n                  Arrow weed        Sagittaria  „\r\n\r\nThe above are only the plants growing in the greatest profusion and do\r\nnot include all which are now contributing to increase the store of\r\nvegetable débris.\r\n\r\n=52. Humus.=—The active principle of vegetable mold is called humus, a\r\nterm used to designate in general the products of the decomposition of\r\nvegetable matter as they are found in soils. In peat and muck are found\r\na mixture of humus with undecomposed or partially decomposed vegetation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kostytchoff[36] vegetable matter decays under the influence\r\nof molds and bacteria. Molds alone produce the dark colored matters\r\nwhich give soils rich in vegetable matter, their color. One chief\r\ncharacteristic of humus is its richness in nitrogen. Black Russian soil\r\ncontains from 4 to 6.65 per cent of nitrogen. This soil is estimated to\r\ncontain sixty million organisms per gram and much of the nitrogen which\r\nit holds must be in the form of proteids. The first development in\r\ndecaying vegetable matter is of bacteria and there is a tendency of the\r\ndecaying matter to become acid. This causes a decay of the bacteria and\r\nthe ammonia produced by this neutralizes the acid. The various kinds of\r\nmold grow when the reaction becomes neutral. Afterwards the bacteria and\r\nthe molds develop together. This statement of Kostytchoff is not a very\r\nsatisfactory explanation of even our limited knowledge of the\r\ndecomposition of organic matters in the soil. Ammonia and ammonia salts\r\nare formed not by the decay of some forms of bacteria but by the\r\nactivities of other forms. Warington found that in nitrification there\r\nwere three distinct forms of bacteria concerned in the final products of\r\nammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. Humus always contains easily\r\ndecomposable matter and consequently the rate of decay at any observed\r\nperiods is nearly the same. In humus which is produced above the\r\nwater-level Kostytchoff states that all trace of the vegetable structure\r\nis destroyed by the leaves being gnawed and passed through the bodies of\r\ncaterpillars and wire-worms. Under the water-level the vegetable\r\nstructure is preserved and peat results. The decay of humus is most\r\nrapid in drained and open soils. For this reason the presence of clay in\r\na soil promotes the accumulation of humus. Inferior organisms are the\r\nmeans of diffusing organic matter through the soil. The mycelia of fungi\r\ngrow on a dead root for instance, ramify laterally and thus carry\r\norganic matter outward and succeeding organisms extend this action and\r\nthe soil becomes darkened in proportion. Humic acid in black soil is\r\nalmost exclusively in combination with lime.\r\n\r\nA more common view of the difference between the formation of humus\r\nabove and below the water-level is that above the water-level there is a\r\nvery free access of air and even the harder parts of the leaf skeleton\r\ncan be oxidized through the agency of bacteria, while under the\r\nwater-level there is a very limited supply of air and this oxidation\r\ncannot proceed as rapidly. The harder parts of the leaf skeleton are\r\npreserved, and from the freer access of air humus is oxidized more\r\nreadily in drained and open soils, and accumulates in clay soils where\r\nthere is less circulation of air.\r\n\r\nThe real composition of humus is a matter which has never been\r\ndefinitely determined. Composed of many different but closely related\r\nsubstances it has been difficult to isolate and determine them.\r\n\r\nStockbridge[37] gives the following composition of the bodies which form\r\nthe larger part of humus:\r\n\r\n                         Ulmin and Ulmic Acid.\r\n       Carbon   67.1 per cent Corresponding to C₄₀H₂₈O₁₂ + H₂O.\r\n       Hydrogen  4.2    „                     „\r\n       Oxygen    8.7    „                     „\r\n\r\n                         Humin and Humic Acid.\r\n\r\n       Carbon   64.4 per cent Corresponding to C₂₁H₂₄_O₁₂ + 3H₂O\r\n       Hydrogen  4.3    „                     „\r\n       Oxygen   31.3    „                     „\r\n\r\n                             Crenic Acid.\r\n\r\n       Carbon   44.0 per cent     Corresponding to C₁₂H₁₂O₈?\r\n       Hydrogen  5.5    „                     „\r\n       Nitrogen  3.9    „                     „\r\n       Oxygen   46.6    „                     „\r\n\r\n                            Apocrenic Acid.\r\n\r\n       Carbon   34.4 per cent    Corresponding to C₂₄H₂₄O₁₂?\r\n       Hydrogen  3.5    „                     „\r\n       Nitrogen  3.0    „                     „\r\n       Oxygen   39.1    „                     „\r\n\r\nHe further states that there are, aside from these humus compounds,\r\nothers still less known and the action of which is not yet understood;\r\namong them xylic acid, C₂₄H₃₀O₁₇, saccharic acid, C₁₄H₁₈O₁₁, glucinic\r\nacid, C₁₂H₂₂O₁₂, besides a brown humus acid containing carbon, 65.8 per\r\ncent, and hydrogen, 6.25 per cent, and a black humus acid yielding\r\ncarbon, 71.5 per cent, and hydrogen, 5.8 per cent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mulder humic acid has the following composition, C₆₀H₅₄O₂₇,\r\nwhile Thenard[38] ascribes to it the formula, C₂₄H₁₀O₁₀.\r\n\r\nAt the present time we can only regard the various forms of humus bodies\r\nas mixtures of many substances mostly of an acid nature and resulting\r\nfrom a gradual decomposition of organic matter under conditions which\r\npartially exclude free access of oxygen.\r\n\r\nFor analytical purposes it is only necessary to separate these bodies by\r\nthe best approved processes. A further knowledge of their composition\r\ncan then be derived by determining the percentages of carbon dioxid and\r\nwater which they yield on combustion.\r\n\r\n=53. Soil and Subsoil.=—Many subdivisions have been made of the above\r\nvarieties of soil, but they have little value for analytical purposes.\r\nFor convenience in description for agricultural purposes, the soil,\r\nhowever, is further divided into soil and subsoil. In this sense the\r\nsoil comprises that portion of the surface of the ground, usually from\r\nfour to nine inches deep, containing most of the organic remains of\r\nplants and animals and in which air circulates more or less freely for\r\nthe proper humification of the organic matter, which usually gives a\r\ndarker color to the soil than to the subsoil. The subsoil proper lies\r\nbelow this, and has usually more characteristic properties, especially\r\nin respect of color and texture, as it has been less influenced by\r\nartificial conditions of cultivation and the remains of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe subsoil extends to an indefinite depth and is limited usually by\r\ndeposits of undecomposed or partly decomposed rock matter, or by layers\r\nof clay, sand or gravel.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, however, as the influence of the subsoil on growing crops is\r\nof little importance below the depth of eighteen inches the analysis of\r\nsamples from a greater depth has more of a geologic than agricultural\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nHilgard regards as subsoil whatever lies beneath the line of change, or\r\nbelow the minimum depth of six inches. But should the change of color\r\noccur at a greater depth than twelve inches, the soil specimen should\r\nnevertheless be taken to the depth of twelve inches only, which is the\r\nlimit of ordinary tillage; then another specimen from that depth down to\r\nthe line of change, and then the subsoil specimens beneath that line.\r\nThe depth to which the last should be taken will depend upon\r\ncircumstances. It is always desirable to know what constitutes the\r\nfoundation of a soil to the depth of three feet at least, since the\r\nquestion of drainage, resistance to drought, etc., will depend\r\nessentially upon the nature of the substratum. But in ordinary cases ten\r\nor twelve inches of subsoil will be sufficient. The sample should be\r\ntaken in other respects precisely like that of the surface soil, while\r\nthat of the material underlying this subsoil may be taken with less\r\nexactness, perhaps at some ditch or other easily accessible point, and\r\nshould not be broken up like the other specimens.\r\n\r\nIn the method of soil sampling adopted by the Royal Agricultural College\r\nof England, the soil is regarded as that portion of the surface of the\r\nground which is reached by ordinary tillage operations, generally being\r\nfrom six to nine inches deep; the subsoil is that portion which is\r\nordinarily not touched in plowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AUTHORITIES CITED IN PART FIRST.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Comptes rendus, Tome 110, p. 1271.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Wyatt, Phosphates of America, p. 66.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Engineering and Mining Journal, August 23, 1890.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  American Journal of Science, Vol. 41, February, 1891.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Preliminary Sketch of Florida Phosphates, Author’s edition, pp. 18, et\r\n  seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Journal für praktische Chemie, 1st series, Band 38, S. 388.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Annual Report Connecticut Experiment Station, 1890, p. 72.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Annual Report Massachusetts Experiment Station, 1887, p. 233.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin 21, Rhode Island Experiment Station, 1893.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Chemical Composition of Food-Fishes.

General Principles.=—It would be unwise to attempt to give any\r\nsingle method of taking soil samples as the only one to be practiced in\r\nall circumstances. In the methods which follow it is believed will be\r\nfound directions for every probable case. The particular method to be\r\nfollowed will in each case have to be determined by circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe sole object in taking a sample of soil should be to have it\r\nrepresentative of the type of soils to which it belongs. Every\r\nprecaution should be observed to have each sample measure up to that\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nThe physical and chemical analyses of soils are long and tedious\r\nprocesses and are entirely too costly to be applied to samples which\r\nrepresent nothing but themselves.\r\n\r\nThe particular place selected for taking the samples as well as the\r\nmethod employed are also largely determined by the point of view of the\r\ninvestigations. The collection of samples to illustrate the geologic or\r\nmineralogical relations of soils is quite a different matter from\r\ngathering portions to represent their agricultural possibilities. In a\r\ngiven area the sum of plant food in the soil would only be determined by\r\nthe analyses of samples from that particular field, while samples\r\nillustrating geologic relations could or should be taken at widely\r\ndistant points. Again the chemist is content with a sample of a few\r\ngrams in weight while the physicist would require a much larger\r\nquantity. Much popular ignorance exists respecting the importance of the\r\ncollection of soil samples. As an illustration of this may be cited a\r\nrecent instance in which a sample of soil was received by the author\r\nwith a request for a complete analysis and a statement of the kinds of\r\ncrops it was suited to grow. No data relating to the locality in which\r\nthe sample was taken accompanied this request. The sample itself, which\r\nweighed a little less than 3.6 grams, was not a soil at all in an\r\nagricultural sense but a highly ferruginous sand.\r\n\r\nThe collector of samples who understands the purpose for which he is\r\nworking will find among the approved methods which follow some one or\r\nsome combination of methods, by means of which his work can be made\r\nsuccessful. In these cases it is the collector rather than the method on\r\nwhich reliance must be placed to secure properly representative samples.\r\n\r\n=55. General Directions for Sampling.=—The locality having been selected\r\nwhich presents as nearly as possible the mean composition of the field a\r\nsquare hole is dug with a sharp spade to the depth of eighteen inches.\r\nThe walls of this hole should be smooth and perpendicular. The soil to\r\nthe depth of six to nine inches is then removed from the sides of the\r\nhole in a slice about four inches thick; or the sample of soil may be\r\ntaken to the depth indicated by a change of color. Any particles which\r\nfall into the bottom of the hole are carefully collected and added to\r\nthe parts adhering to the spade. The whole is thrown into a suitable\r\nvessel for removal to the laboratory. The sample of soil having been\r\nthus secured, the subsoil is taken in the same way. To insure uniformity\r\nin the samples, it is well to take several of them from the same field.\r\nWhere more than one sample is taken it is advisable to mix all the\r\nsub-samples in the field, remove large sticks, stones, roots, etc., and\r\ntake a general sample of from three to five kilograms. The character of\r\nthe débris, etc., removed should be carefully noted.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes desirable to take samples of the subsoil to a greater\r\ndepth than eighteen inches. A post-hole auger or large wood auger will\r\nbe found very useful for this purpose. It is rarely necessary to take\r\nsamples of subsoil to a greater depth than six feet. In taking samples\r\nthe geologic formation and the general topography of the field should be\r\nnoted, also the character of the previous crops, kind and amount of\r\nfertilizers employed, character of drainage and any other data of a\r\nnature to give a more accurate idea of the forces which have determined\r\nthe physical and chemical properties of the sample.\r\n\r\n=56. Method Of Hilgard.=—Hilgard[39] recommends that samples should not\r\nbe taken indiscriminately from any locality you may chance to be\r\ninterested in, but that you should consider what are the two or three\r\nchief varieties of soil which, with their intermixtures, make up the\r\ncultivable area of your region, and carefully sample these first of all.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, and whenever possible, samples should be taken only from\r\nspots that have not been cultivated, or are otherwise likely to have\r\nbeen changed from their original condition of virgin soils and not from\r\nground frequently trodden over such as roadsides, cattle paths, or small\r\npastures, squirrel holes, stumps, or even the foot of trees, or spots\r\nthat have been washed by rains or streams, so as to have experienced a\r\nnoticeable change, and not be a fair representative of their kind. He\r\nfurther suggests that the normal vegetation, trees, herbs, grass, etc.,\r\nshould be carefully observed and recorded, and spots showing unusual\r\ngrowth be avoided whether in kind or quality, as such are likely to have\r\nreceived some animal manure or other outside addition.\r\n\r\nSpecimens should be taken from more than one spot judged to be a fair\r\nrepresentative of the soil intended to be examined as an additional\r\nguarantee of a fair average.\r\n\r\nAfter selecting a proper spot pull up the plants growing on it, and\r\nscrape off the surface lightly with a sharp tool to remove half-decayed\r\nvegetable matter not forming part of the soil. Dig a vertical hole, like\r\na post-hole, at least 20 inches deep. Scrape the sides clean so as to\r\nsee at what depth the change of tint occurs which marks the downward\r\nlimit of the surface soil, and record it. Take at least half a bushel of\r\nthe earth above this limit, and on a cloth (jute bagging should not be\r\nused for this purpose, as its fibers, etc., become intermixed with the\r\nsoil) or paper break it up and mix thoroughly, and put up at least a\r\npint of it in a sack or package for examination. This specimen will,\r\nordinarily, constitute the soil. Should the change of color occur at a\r\nless depth than six inches the fact should be noted, but the specimen\r\ntaken to that depth nevertheless, since it is the least to which\r\nrational cultures can be supposed to reach.\r\n\r\nIn case the difference in the character of a shallow surface soil and\r\nits subsoil should be unusually great, as may be the case in tule or\r\nother alluvial lands or in rocky districts, a separate example of that\r\nsurface soil should be taken, besides the one to the depth of six\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of salty or alkali soils should, as a rule, be taken only\r\ntoward the end of the dry season, when they will contain the maximum\r\namount of the injurious ingredients which it may be necessary to\r\nneutralize.\r\n\r\nWhatever lies beneath the line of change, or below the minimum depth of\r\nsix inches, will constitute the subsoil. Should the change of color\r\noccur at a greater depth than twelve inches the soil specimen should\r\nnevertheless be taken to the depth of twelve inches only, which is the\r\nlimit of ordinary tillage; then another specimen from that depth down to\r\nthe line of change, and then the subsoil specimen beneath that line.\r\n\r\nHilgard justly calls attention to the fact that all peculiarities of the\r\nsoil and subsoil, their behavior in wet and dry seasons, their location,\r\nposition and every circumstance in fact, which can throw any light on\r\ntheir agricultural qualities or peculiarities should be carefully noted\r\nand the notes sent with the samples. Unless accompanied by such\r\ninformation, samples can not ordinarily be considered as justifying the\r\namount of labor involved in their examination.\r\n\r\n=57. Whitney=[40] suggests that a geologic map of the region to be\r\nsampled should always be at hand and that all samples should be rejected\r\nfrom spots showing local discrepancies, washings or other disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe kind of analyses to which a sample is to be subjected also largely\r\ndetermines the method to be pursued in selecting it: For instance, a\r\nsample to be used for determining the size of the particles therein, may\r\nbe taken in quite a different manner from that designed only for the\r\ndetermination of moisture.\r\n\r\n=58. In= the directions collated by Richards[41] and which have been\r\nlargely followed by the correspondents of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nit is recommended to select in a field, four or five places, at least,\r\nper acre, taking care that these places have an homogeneous aspect, and\r\nrepresent as far as possible the general character of the whole ground.\r\nIf the field, however, present notable differences, either in regard to\r\nits aspect or its fertility, the samples gathered from the different\r\nparts must be kept separate.\r\n\r\nThe sampling of arable soil should be made only after the raising of the\r\ncrop and before it has received any new manure. In other soils the\r\nsample should be taken only from spots that have not been cultivated.\r\n\r\n=59. In= the method of soil sampling adopted by the German Experiment\r\nStations[42] it is directed that the samples of soil should be taken\r\naccording to the extent of the surface to be sampled, in three, five,\r\nnine, twelve or more places at equal distances from each other. They\r\nshould be taken in perpendicular sections to the depth turned by the\r\nplow; and for some studies of the subsoil to a depth of sixty to ninety\r\ncentimeters. The single samples can be either examined separately or\r\ncarefully mixed and an average portion of the mixture taken.\r\n\r\n=60. Method of the Official French Commission.=—The official French\r\ncommission[43] emphasizes the fact that the sample of soil taken for\r\nanalysis, should represent a layer of equal thickness through the total\r\ndepth of its arable part. An analysis of the subsoil taken in the same\r\nway, will often be useful to complete the data of the soil study.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, according to this authority, it is necessary to determine\r\nthe point of view from which the sample is to be taken. If the object is\r\na general study, having for its aim the determination of the general\r\ncomposition of the soils of a definite geologic formation, the sample\r\nshould be taken in such a way that the different characteristics of the\r\nsoil alone should enter into consideration without paying any attention\r\nto its accidental components, which have been determined by local\r\ncauses, such as are produced by continued high cultivation, the\r\napplication of abundant fertilizers, or the practice of a particular\r\nline of agriculture. The samples of soil therefore, with such an object\r\nin view, should be taken on parts of the earth which are beyond the\r\nreach of the causes mentioned above and which tend to modify the nature\r\nof the primitive soil. In such a case it is the soil which has not been\r\nmodified, or better still, virgin soil, such as is found in the\r\nwoodlands and prairies, which should be taken for a sample, choosing\r\nthose places in which the geologic formation is most perfectly\r\ncharacterized. In such a case a soil taken in one spot corresponding to\r\nthe conditions before mentioned, would be the best for the purposes in\r\nview. The sample would thus represent a true type to be studied, not one\r\nof a mean composition got by taking samples from different localities\r\nand mixing them into a homogeneous parcel. This last method of\r\nproceeding could introduce into the sample earth modified by culture or\r\nby influences purely accidental. However, it would be wise, in a region\r\ncharacterized by the same geologic formation, to take a certain number\r\nof samples in different localities, and examine singly each one of them\r\nin order to be assured that there is a uniformity of composition in the\r\nwhole of the soils.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, it is the purpose of the investigation to furnish\r\ninformation to the cultivator concerning the fields which are worked, it\r\nis necessary to approach the problem from a different point of view. In\r\nthis case the earth which is under cultivation should be first of all\r\nconsidered with all the modifications which nature causes or practical\r\nculture has caused, in it. But it often happens that upon the same farm\r\nthe natural soil is variable, caused either by the washings from the\r\nadjacent soils, by the accumulation at certain points of deposits formed\r\nfrom standing water, or from other reasons. In such a case it would be\r\nnecessary to take samples from every part of the field which exhibited\r\nany variation from the general type, in order to get a complete mean\r\nsample of the whole. It is necessary to be on guard against making a\r\nmixture of these different lots which would neither represent the\r\ndifferent soils constituting the farm nor their mean composition. It\r\nwould be better to examine each of these samples alone and then from\r\nthose parts which appear to have a similar composition, to take a\r\ngeneral sample for the mean analysis.\r\n\r\nMost often it is necessary to confine our studies to the really\r\nimportant part of the farm the composition of which would have a\r\npractical interest. The aspect of the spontaneous vegetation in such a\r\ncase, will often serve as a guide to determine the parts of the farms\r\nwhich are similar in nature. The sample should represent the arable\r\nlayer, properly so-called, that is, that part of it which is stirred by\r\nthe agricultural implements in use and in which the root system of the\r\nplant takes its greatest development and which is the true reservoir of\r\nthe fertilizing materials.\r\n\r\nWhen a trench is dug in the soil it is easy to distinguish the arable\r\nlayer from the subsoil. In the first place, its color is different,\r\ngenerally being modified by vegetable débris which forms the supply of\r\nhumus. The depth of the arable layer is variable, but it is most\r\nfrequently between 200 and 300 millimeters. In the analysis the depth\r\nand layers should be indicated since the chemical composition of the\r\nearth varies according as the sample is taken to a greater or less\r\ndepth. As an example of this it may be said that the quantity of\r\nnitrogen decreases in general in proportion as the depth of the layer is\r\nincreased. The sample, therefore, should be limited exactly to the\r\narable layer of soil.\r\n\r\n=61. Caldwell=[44] advises that according to the purpose of the analysis\r\nsamples be taken:\r\n\r\n_a_, from one or from several spots in the field, in order to subject\r\neach sample to a separate analysis; or\r\n\r\n_b_, for an average representation of the soil of the whole field; in\r\nthis case, several portions of earth are taken from points distributed\r\nin a regular manner over the field, all of which are most carefully\r\nmixed together, and 4–6 kilograms of the mixture, free from any large\r\nstones, are preserved as the average sample.\r\n\r\nAn excavation in the soil 30–50 centimeters deep, or through to the\r\nsubsoil, and 30–50 centimeters square, with one side as nearly vertical\r\nas possible is made and a slice taken from this side of uniform\r\nthickness throughout, weighing 4–5 kilograms. If the subsoil is to be\r\nexamined, a sample of it should be taken out in the same manner as\r\ndirected for the upper soil, to the depth of about 60 centimeters.\r\n\r\nIf the character of the soil varies materially in different parts of the\r\nfield, samples from several spots should be analyzed separately.\r\n\r\nA small portion of the sample should be put at once in a well-stoppered\r\nbottle; the remainder may be allowed to become air-dried, by exposing it\r\nin a thin layer, in summer, to the common temperature in the shade, or,\r\nin winter, to that of a warm room, or a moderately warm drying-chamber,\r\nheated to 30°–40°; in either case it should be carefully protected from\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nAt the time of taking the sample of the soil, observations should be\r\nmade in regard to the following points:\r\n\r\n_a._ The geognostic origin of the soil.\r\n\r\n_b._ The nature of the underlying strata, to the depth of 1–2 meters, if\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n_c._ The meteorology of the locality, by consulting meteorological\r\nrecords, if possible; otherwise, by the general opinion of the\r\nneighborhood; in this connection, the height of the locality above the\r\nlevel of the sea should be noted also.\r\n\r\n_d._ The management and rotation of crops in previous years.\r\n\r\n_e._ The character of the customary manuring.\r\n\r\n_f._ The amount of the crops removed in the preceding year, and, if\r\npossible, the average amount of each of the more important crops yielded\r\nby the field.\r\n\r\n_g._ The practical judgment of neighboring farmers in regard to the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nCaldwel’s method is practically identical with that of Wolff[45] which\r\nwas one of the earliest of the systematic schemes for taking soil\r\nsamples.\r\n\r\n=62. Wahnschaffe=[46] insists on rather a fuller preliminary statement\r\nto accompany soil samples but gives essentially the method of Wolff with\r\nsome unimportant variations which add little to the value of the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n=63. Method Of Peligot.=—According to Peligot[47] the taking of samples\r\nof soil of which the physical and chemical properties are to be\r\ndetermined is a delicate operation.\r\n\r\nThese samples should represent as nearly as possible both the good and\r\nbad qualities of a soil.\r\n\r\nIn the field selected are chosen a certain number of places at least\r\nfour or five per hectare. The spots selected should have a homogeneous\r\nappearance—resembling as nearly as possible the general aspect of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nBy means of a spade a few kilograms of earth are removed to the depth of\r\nthe subsoil being careful to include in the sample no accidental\r\ndetritus which the upper part of the soil especially may contain.\r\n\r\nThe samples should be taken immediately after the crop is harvested and\r\nbefore any fresh fertilizer is applied. The samples are carefully mixed\r\nand placed in a glass bottle or flask.\r\n\r\nThe sample of subsoil is obtained in the same manner. If the field\r\npresents notable differences in surface or fertility all the samples\r\ntaken should be examined separately.\r\n\r\n=64. Method of Whitney.=[48]—An ordinary wood auger, 2½ inches in\r\ndiameter is so arranged as to admit of additions to the stem to enable\r\nthe operator to take samples at different depths. It may be fitted with\r\na short piece of gas pipe for a handle and the several pieces of which\r\nit is composed may be taken apart and carried in a knapsack.\r\n\r\nIn taking a soil sample the boring is continued until a change in color\r\nshows that the subsoil has been reached. The auger cuts a very clean\r\nsample save in excessively sandy soil. After the soil sample is secured\r\nthe hole is cleaned out and the sample of subsoil taken by the same\r\ninstrument. The soil is conveniently preserved in heavy cloth bags of\r\nwhich the usual size is 6 by 8½ inches. Where larger samples are\r\nrequired the size of the bag is correspondingly increased. Each bag is\r\nto be tagged or labeled to correspond with the entry in the note book.\r\n\r\nSamples to determine the amount of empty space in a soil are taken as\r\nfollows: The sampler is a piece of brass cylinder about nine inches long\r\nand about 1½ inches in diameter. A piece of clock spring is soldered in\r\none end and sharpened to give a good cutting edge. This arrangement\r\npermits the sample to pass into the cylinder without much friction. The\r\narea enclosed by the clock spring is accurately determined and a mark is\r\nplaced in the cylinder six inches from the cutting edge. The cylinder is\r\ndriven into the soil to a depth of six inches, a steel cap being used to\r\nprevent the hammer from injuring the cylinder. The earth is next removed\r\nfrom about the cylinder with a trowel, and the separated cylinder of\r\nearth is cut smoothly off by a sharp knife and removed together with its\r\nbrass envelope. The sample is taken to the laboratory in a cloth bag,\r\ndried and weighed.\r\n\r\n=65. Taking Samples for Moisture Determination.=—A number of brass tubes\r\nis provided nine inches long and ¾ inch in diameter and with a mark six\r\ninches from the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe tube is pushed down into the soil to the mark and the sample of soil\r\nremoved with the tube. There is but little danger of the sample dropping\r\nout of the tube even in sandy soils. When the tube is withdrawn each end\r\nis capped with a rubber finger tip making a perfectly air tight joint.\r\nThe tubes containing the samples can be kept several days with no fear\r\nof losing moisture. This method is especially useful in having samples\r\ntaken by observers in different localities who can enclose the tubes in\r\na cloth sack and send them to the laboratory by mail daily or at stated\r\nintervals. A tube of the size given holds about fifty grams of soil.\r\n\r\n=66. Taking Samples to Determine the Permeability of Soil to Water or\r\nAir.=—Whitney[49] determines the permeability of soil or subsoil to\r\nwater or air in the following manner:\r\n\r\nAn excavation two feet square and eighteen inches deep is made in the\r\nsoil. On one side of this hole the sample of soil or subsoil is taken by\r\nmeans of a narrow saw blade and a sharp carving knife. The sample of\r\nsoil taken should be two inches square and 3½ to 4 inches long.\r\n\r\nIt is placed in a brass cylinder three inches long and 3¼ inches in\r\ndiameter. The open space in the cylinder is filled with paraffin heated\r\njust to its melting point. As the paraffin cools the upper surface\r\nshould be kept stirred to prevent the mass when set from receding from\r\nthe square column of soil. Care must be taken to keep the paraffin from\r\nthe ends of the soil columns and these should be left, as far as\r\npossible in their natural condition.\r\n\r\nThe rate of percolation of the water may be determined at the time the\r\nsample is taken. For this purpose an additional section of brass tube\r\ntwo inches deep is secured to the one holding the sample by a rubber\r\nband. An iron rod is driven into the earth carrying a retort stand ring\r\nsupporting a funnel filled with fine gravel. The lower end of the soil\r\ncolumn in the brass cylinder is placed on this gravel. Water is next\r\ncarefully poured upon the top of the sample of soil being careful not to\r\ndisturb the surface. The surface of the sample may be protected with a\r\nlittle fine sand. The water should be poured on the paraffin thus\r\naffording an additional protection to the soil surface. When the water\r\nbegins to drop from the funnel a graduated glass is set under it and the\r\ntime required for a given volume to pass through under an initial\r\npressure of two inches is noted. The volume required represents one inch\r\nin depth over the four square inches of soil surface, _viz._: four cubic\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n=67. Sampling of Soil for Staple Crops.=—Some variations from the usual\r\nmethods are recommended by Whitney when the samples are taken from\r\nfields growing staple crops.\r\n\r\nThe immediate object of the work, for which these samples are desired,\r\nis to make a thorough study of the physical and chemical properties of a\r\nnumber of typical soils adapted to the different staple crops, such as\r\ngrass, wheat, truck, and the different types of tobacco. They should be\r\ntaken for a careful study of the texture of the soils, the relative\r\namount and arrangement of sand and clay, the relation of the soils to\r\nmoisture and heat, and the ease with which they can maintain a proper\r\nwater supply for the different staple crops under existing climatic and\r\ncultural conditions. The ultimate object of such a study is to see how\r\nthese conditions can be changed so as to make the soils more productive,\r\nand make them yield a better quality of crop, or to change the\r\nconditions in other soils, which differ from these, so that the culture\r\nof the different staple crops can be extended over wider areas by\r\nimproved methods of cultivation and manuring.\r\n\r\nThe soil selected for sampling for these investigations should be\r\ntypical, should represent fairly well a considerable area of land. It\r\nshould represent either the very best type of land for the staple crop\r\nor crops of the locality, or the very poorest lands for these same\r\ncrops. Both of these extremes are desired for contrast. For example, if\r\nthe staple crop of the locality is wheat or a certain type of tobacco,\r\nselect the soil best adapted to this staple crop, and another soil, if\r\npossible, in the same locality, representing considerable area of land\r\nupon which this staple crop cannot be successfully grown on account of\r\nthe inferior yield, quality, or the time of ripening of the crop. The\r\nsoil sampled should be, or should recently have been, under actual\r\ncultivation in the crop or crops best adapted to it, so that the real\r\nagricultural value of the land can be accurately known.\r\n\r\nThe samples should be taken inside the field, some distance away from\r\nfences, roads, or trees. If there are plants growing in the field, the\r\nsample should be taken about midway between two plants. The samples\r\nshould be taken where they will typify fairly well the average soil of\r\nthe field and of the large area of land which they are to represent.\r\n\r\nThe samples are taken in some one of the ways described herein. Each\r\nsample should be carefully labelled at the time of taking. The following\r\nblank form will be found convenient for this purpose:\r\n\r\n                         │Locality:\r\n LABORATORY No.:         │\r\n ────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n No. of sack:            │Description: (virgin or cultivated).\r\n                         │  (_a_) Natural herbage:\r\n                         │  (_b_) Crops best adapted to land (grass,\r\n                         │  wheat, tobacco, truck, barren).\r\n                         │                      „\r\n ------------------------│                      „\r\n Date:                   │                      „\r\n                         │                      „\r\n ------------------------│                      „\r\n Collector:              │                      „\r\n                         │                      „\r\n ------------------------│------------------------\r\n     Depth of sample:    │\r\n    (Soil or Subsoil?)   │Geologic formation:\r\n  ... in. to ... inches. │\r\n\r\n=68. Method of the Royal Agricultural Society.=[50]—Have a wooden box\r\nmade, six inches long and wide, and from nine to twelve inches deep,\r\naccording to the depth of soil and subsoil in the field. At one of the\r\nselected places mark out a space of twelve inches square; dig around it\r\nin a slanting direction a trench, so as to leave undisturbed a block of\r\nsoil, with its subsoil, from nine to twelve inches deep; trim this block\r\nto make it fit into the wooden box, invert the open box over it, press\r\ndown firmly, then pass a spade under the box and lift it up and gently\r\nturn it over.\r\n\r\nIn the case of very light, sandy, and porous soils, the wooden box may\r\nbe at once inverted over the soil and forced down by pressure, and then\r\ndug out.\r\n\r\nProceed in the same way for collecting the samples from all the selected\r\nplaces in the field, taking care that the subsoil is not mixed with the\r\nsurface soil. The former should be sampled separately.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the plot for the gathering of the sample, take care to have\r\nit lightly scraped so as to remove any débris which may be accidentally\r\nfound there.\r\n\r\nThe different samples thus procured are emptied on a clean, boarded\r\nsurface, and thoroughly mixed, so as to incorporate the different\r\nsamples of the same field together. The heap is then divided into four\r\ndivisions, and the opposite quarters are put aside, taking care to leave\r\nthe two remaining ones undisturbed; these are thoroughly mixed together,\r\nthe heap divided into quarters, and the opposite ones taken away as\r\nbefore. This operation of mixing, dividing into quarters and taking away\r\nthe opposite quarter is continued until a sample is left weighing about\r\nten or twelve pounds.\r\n\r\nThus is obtained the average sample of the soil. Of course where only a\r\nsingle sample is taken from the field this method of quartering is not\r\nresorted to, but the bottom of the box is nailed directly on and sent to\r\nthe laboratory, where the soil is to be analyzed.\r\n\r\n=69. Grandeau=[51] suggests that in taking soil samples there are two\r\ncases to be considered; first a homogeneous soil and second, a soil\r\nvariable in its appearance and composition. First, if the soil is\r\nhomogeneous, being of the same geologic formation it will be sufficient\r\nto take a mean sample in accordance with the following directions:\r\n\r\nThe field is first divided by diagonals or by transverse lines the\r\ndirection of which need not be fixed in advance but as inspection of the\r\nform and configuration of the field may indicate. In the ordinary\r\nconditions, of homogeniety (marly, granite, argillaceous or silicious\r\nsoils) it will be sufficient to select about five points per hectare\r\nfrom which the samples are to be taken. These points having been\r\ndetermined the surface is cleaned in such a way as to remove from it the\r\ndetritus which may accidentally cover it; such as dry leaves, fragments\r\nof wood, foreign bodies, etc. The surface having been prepared, (five to\r\nsix square meters) a hole is dug four-tenths of a meter long and as wide\r\nas the spade employed. The sides should be as nearly vertical as\r\npossible. As to depth it varies with the usage of the country in regard\r\nto tillage. The layer of arable earth is what in effect properly\r\nconstitutes the soil. It ought not to be mixed with any fragments of the\r\nsubsoil. When the hole is properly cleaned the samples are secured with\r\na spade from the sides of the excavations. About five kilograms are\r\ntaken. The soil is placed in a proper receptacle as it is removed from\r\nthe hole.\r\n\r\nThis operation is repeated on as many points as may be necessary to\r\nobtain a mean sample of the soil of the whole field.\r\n\r\nAll the samples are now collected on a table sufficiently large, and\r\nintimately mixed together. Two samples, each of about five kilograms,\r\nare then taken from the mixed material. One sample is immediately placed\r\nin bottles and carefully stoppered and sealed; the other is dried in the\r\nsun or on the hearth of a furnace. When sufficiently dry the second\r\nsample is also placed in bottles and well stoppered. While mixing the\r\nsamples, pebbles, etc., of the size of a nut and larger are removed, the\r\nweight of the rejected matter being determined. The nature of the\r\npebbles should also be noted; whether silicates, limestone, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sample of subsoil is taken in exactly the same manner, using the\r\nsame holes from which the samples of soil were taken. The nature, the\r\narrangement and the appearance of the strata will indicate the depth to\r\nwhich the subsoil should be taken. In general, a depth equal to that of\r\nthe sample of soil will be sufficient. The depth to which the roots of\r\ncultivated plants reach is also a good indication in taking a sample of\r\nthe subsoil. In forests the sample of subsoil should be taken from four\r\nto five-tenths of a meter below the surface.\r\n\r\nIf the soil in respect of its geologic formation, its fertility or its\r\nphysical aspect presents great differences, special samples should be\r\ntaken in each part in accordance with the directions given above.\r\n\r\n=70. Method of the Official Agricultural Chemists.=—In the directions\r\ngiven by the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists[52] it is\r\nstated that the soil selected should be as far as possible in its\r\nnatural condition, not modified by recent applications of manure, or\r\nchanged by the transporting action of water or wind. Surface\r\naccumulations of decaying leaves, etc., should be removed before taking\r\nthe sample.\r\n\r\nTo eliminate accidental variations in the soil, select specimens from\r\nfive or six places in the field which seem to be fair averages of the\r\nsoil, remove two or three pounds of the soil, taking it down to the\r\ndepth of nine or ten inches[53] so as to include the whole depth. Mix\r\nthese soils intimately, remove any stones, shake out all roots and\r\nforeign matter, and dry the soil until it-becomes friable.[54] Break\r\ndown any lumps in a mortar with a wooden pestle, but avoid pulverizing\r\nany mineral fragments; pass eight to ten pounds of the soil through a\r\nsieve, having circular perforations one twenty-fifth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, rejecting all pebbles and materials too coarse to pass through\r\nthe sieve. Once more mix intimately the sifted soil. Expose in thin\r\nlayers in a warm room till thoroughly air dry (or dry it in an air-bath\r\nat a temperature of 40°), place six to eight pounds in a clean bottle,\r\nwith label of locality and date, and cork the bottle containing the\r\nsoil, for analysis.\r\n\r\nThe soil is rapidly dried to arrest nitrification; it is not heated\r\nabove 40° lest there should be dissipation of ammonia compounds, or a\r\nchange in solubility. The normal limit to which the soil may be heated\r\nin place by the sun’s rays should not be exceeded in preparing a sample\r\nfor an agricultural chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nThe relative amount of fragments too coarse to pass through the sieve\r\nshould be made a matter of record. They are soil material, but not yet\r\nsoil, so far as agricultural purposes are concerned.\r\n\r\n=71. Method of Lawes.=—In a late method of sampling proposed by Sir J.\r\nB. Lawes[55] a steel frame ten by twelve inches, and nine inches deep\r\nopen at top and bottom is driven into the earth until its upper edge is\r\nlevel with the surface of the soil. All above-ground vegetation is then\r\ncut off as closely as possible with scissors. The soil within the frame\r\nis then removed exactly to the depth of the frame, and immediately\r\nweighed. It is then partially dried, and mechanically separated by a\r\nseries of sieves, all visible vegetable matter being at the same time\r\npicked out. The stones and roots and the remaining soil are thus\r\nseparated, and the determinations of dry matter, nitrogen, etc., are\r\nmade in the separated soil after being finely powdered. The loss of\r\nwater at each stage of preparation and on drying the samples as analyzed\r\nis also carefully determined. This method, which requires the soil to be\r\ntaken to an arbitrary depth of nine inches, could not be used when\r\nsamples of strictly arable soil are to be taken.\r\n\r\n=72. In taking= a sample by the French commission[56] method it is\r\nnecessary to remove from the surface, the living and dead vegetation\r\nwhich covers the soil. With a spade a square hole is then dug to the\r\ndepth of about 500 millimeters; in other words, to a depth considerably\r\nexceeding that of the arable layer. Afterwards on each of the four sides\r\nof the hole there is removed by the spade, a prismatic layer of the\r\narable portion of a thickness equal to its depth. The samples thus\r\nobtained are united together and carefully mixed for the purpose of\r\nforming a sample for analysis. If there are large stones they are\r\nremoved by hand and their proportion by weight determined.\r\n\r\nIn all cases it would prove useful to take a sample of the subsoil which\r\nis far from playing a secondary rôle. The rootlets bury themselves\r\ndeeply in it and seek there a part of their nourishment. The subsoil,\r\ntherefore, furnishes an important addition to the alimentation of the\r\nplants. For taking a sample of the subsoil a ditch is dug of sufficient\r\ndepth, say one meter, and the arable soil carefully removed from the top\r\nportion. Afterwards pieces are taken from the four sides of the hole at\r\nvariable depths, which should always be indicated, and which should\r\nextend in general, from six to eight-tenths of a meter below the arable\r\nsoil since it is demonstrated that the roots of nearly all plants go at\r\nleast to this depth. The analysis of the subsoil, however, is less\r\nimportant than that of the soil, properly so-called, because the\r\nagronomist does not act directly upon it and takes no thought of\r\nmodifying it and enriching it as he does the layer of arable soil. But\r\nthe composition of the subsoil is a source of information capable of\r\nexplaining certain cultural results and capable sometimes, of leading to\r\nthe correct way of improving the soil, as in cases where the subsoil can\r\nbe advantageously mixed with the superficial layer.\r\n\r\n=73. Wolff=[57] suggests that a hole thirty centimeters square be dug\r\nperpendicularly and a section from one of the sides taken for the\r\nsample. To the depth of thirty centimeters the sample shall be taken as\r\nsoil and to the additional depth of thirty centimeters as subsoil. The\r\nthickness of the section taken may vary according to the quantity of the\r\nsample desired. For analytical purposes, five kilograms will usually be\r\nsufficient. When culture experiments are also contemplated a larger\r\nquantity will be required.\r\n\r\n=74. Method of Wahnschaffe.=—The method of sampling advised by\r\nWahnschaffe[58] is but little different from that of Wolff already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nA square sample hole is dug with a spade having its sides perpendicular\r\nto the horizon. The soil which is removed is thrown on a cloth and\r\ncarefully mixed. From the whole mass a convenient amount is next removed\r\ncare being taken not to include any roots. In a similar manner it is\r\ndirected to proceed for the sample of subsoil. At first the subsoil\r\nshould be removed to a depth of two to three decimeters. The number and\r\ndepth of subsequent samples will depend chiefly upon the character of\r\nthe soil. Where samples are taken to the depth of two meters the use of\r\na post-hole auger is recommended.\r\n\r\nThe samples taken should not be too small. In general from two to three\r\nkilograms should remain after all preliminary sampling is finished.\r\n\r\n=75. Method of König.=—The directions given by König[59] for taking soil\r\nsamples are almost identical with those prescribed by Wahnschaffe and do\r\nnot require any further illustration.\r\n\r\n=76. Special Instruments Employed in Taking Samples.=—In general a sharp\r\nspade or post-hole auger is quite sufficient for all ordinary sampling\r\nbut for certain special purposes other apparatus may be used.\r\n\r\nThe instrument which is used by King[60] consists of a thin metal tube\r\nof a size and length suited to the special object in view, provided with\r\na point which enables it to cut a core of soil smaller than the internal\r\nbore of the tube and at the same time make a hole in the ground larger\r\nthan its outside diameter. Its construction is shown in figure 11, in\r\nwhich A B represent a soil tube intended to take samples down to a depth\r\nof four feet. A′ is a cross-section of the cutting end of the tube,\r\nwhich is made by soldering a heavy tin collar, about three inches wide,\r\nto the outside of a large tube allowing its lower end to project about\r\none-half an inch. Into this collar a second one is soldered with one\r\nedge projecting about one-quarter of an inch and the other abutting\r\ndirectly against the end of the soil tube. Still inside of this collar\r\nis a third about one-half an inch wide which projects beyond the second\r\nand forms the cutting edge of the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 11.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the head of the tube is shown at B′. It is formed by\r\nturning a flange on the upper end of the tube and then wrapping it\r\nclosely with thick wire for a distance of about three inches, the wire\r\nbeing securely fixed by soldering. The soil tube should be of as light\r\nweight as possible not to buckle when being forced into the ground, and\r\nthe cutting edge thin. The brass tubing used by gas fitters in covering\r\ntheir pipes has been found very satisfactory for ordinary sampling. With\r\na one inch soil tube four feet long it is possible to get a clear\r\ncontinuous sample of soil to that depth by simply forcing the tube into\r\nthe ground with the hand and withdrawing it, or the sample may be taken\r\nin sections of any intermediate length. Later in the season when the\r\nsoil becomes dryer it is necessary to use a heavy wooden mallet to force\r\nthe tube, and this should be done with light blows.\r\n\r\nThe closeness with which it is possible to duplicate the samples in\r\nweight by this method will be seen below, where from each of four\r\nlocalities three samples were taken from the surface to a depth of four\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nSHOWING VARIATIONS IN THE DRY WEIGHT OF TRIPLICATE SAMPLES OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n       ─────────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────\r\n                                │    A.    │    B.    │    C.\r\n       ─────────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n         I. Surface to four feet│716.6 gms.│715.5 gms.│710.3 gms.\r\n        II. Surface to four feet│715.4 gms.│687.1 gms.│731.2 gms.\r\n       III. Surface to four feet│654.0 gms.│688.3 gms.│709.0 gms.\r\n        IV. Surface to four feet│714.0 gms.│687.8 gms.│719.3 gms.\r\n\r\nThese four series of samples were taken at the four corners of a square\r\ntwelve feet on a side and serve to show how much samples may vary in\r\nthat distance. The large difference shown in III, A is due to the fact\r\nthat the soil tube penetrated a hole left by the decay of a rather large\r\nroot as shown by the bark in the sample.\r\n\r\n=77. Auger for Taking Samples.=—It has already been said that the\r\nordinary auger used for boring fence post-holes may be used to advantage\r\nin taking soil samples. Large wood augers can also be used to advantage\r\nfor the same purpose. For special purposes, however, other forms of\r\naugers may be used.\r\n\r\nNorwacki and Borchardt[61] have described a new auger for taking samples\r\nof soil for analytical purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 12.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn figure 12, A, B and C show the general exterior and interior form of\r\nthe instrument. The handle is hollow and made of iron gas pipe covered\r\nwith leather. On the inside of this, in the middle, is fixed a wooden\r\nplug a, which leaves two compartments, one in each end for holding the\r\nbrass plug bb,’ and the wicker lubricating wad cc.’ The stem of the\r\nauger a, is heavy and made of eight-sided steel and the under end is\r\nstrengthened with a heavy casting fitting into the auger guide g g. The\r\nend of the auger I I′ is triangular and hardened. The auger guide g g,\r\nis made out of a single piece of drawn steel tubing. Above it is\r\nstrengthened by a ring-shaped piece of iron or copper and its lower end\r\nis furnished with saw teeth as shown in K and is hardened. The fixing\r\nkey e, is bent in the form of a hook and can be passed through the two\r\nholes o o, of the auger stem and through the one hole o′ in the\r\nstrengthened part of the auger guide. It permits the auger guide to be\r\nfixed upon the auger stem in two different positions, higher and lower.\r\nOn one end it is cut squarely across and on the other provided with a\r\nconical hole drilled into it. It fits on the one hand exactly in the\r\nauger guide and on the other loosely plays in the cavity of the handle\r\nat b, designed to hold it when not in use. The cap d′ is made of heavy\r\nsheet brass and is fastened upon the end of the handle at c c′ after the\r\nmanner of a bayonet. The wicker cartridge is made of rolled and sewed\r\nwicker-work. At the upper end it is provided with a metallic button and\r\nbefore use it is saturated with paraffin oil. It fits on the one side\r\nfirmly in the auger guide and on the other in the cavity, of the handle\r\nc where it is kept when not in use. The union h is made of a brass tube\r\nwhich below is closed with a piece of solid brass upon the inside of\r\nwhich a hole is bored. In this hole rests the end of the auger stem when\r\nthe union is placed firmly upon the auger guide.\r\n\r\nThe auger is placed together as is shown in A B, the union h is taken\r\noff and it is driven with gentle blows, turning it back and forth, to\r\nthe proper depth into the soil. After the key is loosened the auger is\r\nlifted high enough so that the second hole appears and then it is fixed\r\nin position by the key. Then the boring is continued, turning the auger\r\nto the right, by which the auger, eating its way with its saw teeth,\r\npresses deeper into the ground and withdraws the material for analysis.\r\nAfter the auger guide has been filled through any desired length, say\r\nfive to ten centimeters with the sample of soil, the whole auger is\r\ndrawn out of the soil, the key removed, the auger stem withdrawn from\r\nthe auger guide, the apparatus opened by turning the bayonet fastening\r\nof the stopper on the handle, the brass plug placed in the end and then\r\nwith the smooth part forward, from above, it is allowed to fall into the\r\nauger guide until it reaches the soil. The auger stem is then put back,\r\nthe point of it fitting into the hole of the plug and the sample of soil\r\nshoved out of the auger guide. The auger guide is again fixed on the\r\nauger stem by the key and then the apparatus is ready for a second\r\noperation. When the borings cease the wicker cartridge is drawn out of\r\nthe handle and shoved, the soft end forward, from above, into the auger\r\nguide and the brass plug after it and pushed through with the auger\r\nstem. By this process the wicker cartridge gives up a sufficient amount\r\nof paraffin oil to completely grease the inside of the auger guide and\r\nto protect it from rust. After use the instrument should be cleaned on\r\nthe outside by means of a cloth, the plug and wicker wad replaced in\r\ntheir proper positions, the cap fixed on the handle and the union on the\r\npoint of the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe length of the whole apparatus may reach one meter or more; the\r\ninternal diameter sixteen millimeters. The apparatus weighs with a\r\nlength of one meter, together with all its belongings, about two\r\nkilograms. For the investigation of peat and muck soils as well as sand,\r\ninstead of the steel auger guide one of brass or copper can be used. For\r\nthis purpose the length of the apparatus may reach three to four meters.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with other apparatus which are used for taking samples, it\r\nappears without doubt that with the one just described a better and less\r\nmixed portion of the soil can be obtained at great depths. The apparatus\r\nis said to have many advantages over a similar one known as Fraenkel’s,\r\nand is much more easy to clean. The advantages of the apparatus are said\r\nto be the following: The farmer with this piece of apparatus in a short\r\ntime can go over his whole farm taking samples to the depth of ninety\r\ncentimeters since a single boring does not take more than one minute.\r\nGeologists and others interested in the soil at greater depths can use\r\nan apparatus three to four meters in length and obtain unmixed samples\r\nfrom these lower depths. These are also interesting from a bacteriologic\r\npoint of view. The entire apparatus is especially valuable for the\r\ninvestigation of the lower parts of peat and muck soils. The apparatus\r\nhas been tried in the collection of samples for the laboratory of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture and is too complicated to be recommended for\r\nordinary use. When however samples are to be taken at great depths as in\r\npeat soils it is highly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n=78. Soil Sampling= depends for its success more on the judgment and\r\nknowledge of the collector than on the method employed and the apparatus\r\nused. One skilled in the art and having correct knowledge of the purpose\r\nof the work will be able to get a fair sample with a splinter or a\r\njack-knife while another with the most elaborate outfit might fail\r\nentirely in collecting anything of representative value.\r\n\r\nThere are some special kinds of soil sampling, however, which cannot be\r\nleft to the method of the individual and it is believed that with the\r\ndescriptions given above nearly all purposes for which samples are\r\ndesired may be served.\r\n\r\nFor the study of nitrifying organisms, however, special precautions are\r\nrequired and these will be noted in a more appropriate place.\r\n\r\nIn taking samples for moisture determinations the method of Whitney is\r\nrecommended as the best. For the general physical and chemical\r\nanalytical work the standard methods are all essentially the same. The\r\nprinciples laid down by Hilgard will be found a sufficient guide in most\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 TREATMENT OF SAMPLE IN THE LABORATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=79. The Sample=, or mixed sample, taken by one of the methods above\r\ndescribed, is placed on a hard smooth board, broken up by gentle\r\npressure into as fine particles as possible and all pieces of stone and\r\ngravel carefully removed and weighed; all roots, particles of vegetable\r\nmatter, worms, etc., are also to be weighed and thrown out. This can be\r\ndone very well by using a sieve of from one to two millimeter mesh. Care\r\nshould be taken that the soil be made to pass through, which can be\r\naccomplished by subjecting the lumps to renewed pressure with a\r\nrubber-tipped pestle. In the above operation the soil should be dry\r\nenough to prevent sticking. The relative weights of the pebbles, roots,\r\netc., and the soil should be determined.\r\n\r\n=80. Order of Preliminary Examination.=—Hilgard[62] commences the\r\nexamination of a soil sample by washing about ten grams of it into a\r\nbeaker with a water current of definite velocity, stirring meanwhile\r\nactively the part carried into the vessel. The residue not carried by\r\nthe current is examined macro- and microscopically to determine the\r\nminerals which may be present, and the condition in which the fragments\r\nexist—whether sharp or rounded edges, etc.\r\n\r\nThis examination will give some general idea of the parent rocks from\r\nwhich the sample has been derived and of the distance the particles have\r\nbeen transported. Next follows the hand test, _viz._, rubbing the soil\r\nbetween the thumb and fingers first in the dry state and afterwards\r\nkneading it with water and observing its plasticity. Following this\r\nshould come a test of the relations of the sample to water, _viz._, its\r\ncapacity for absorbing and retaining moisture. Finally the separation of\r\nthe soil into particles of definite hydraulic value and a chemical\r\nexamination of the different classes of soil concludes the analytical\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n=81. Air Drying.=—The sifted soil should be thoroughly mixed and about\r\none kilogram spread on paper and left for several days exposed in a room\r\nwith free circulation of air and without artificial heat. The part of\r\nthe sample to be used for the determination of nitrates should be dried\r\nmore quickly as described in another place. The sample is then placed in\r\na clean, dry glass bottle, corked, sealed, and labeled. The label or\r\nnote book should indicate the locality where the sample was taken, the\r\nkind of soil, the number of places sampled, and other information\r\nnecessary to proper description and identification.\r\n\r\n=82. Caldwell=[63] directs that having taken the sample to the\r\nlaboratory, the stones and larger pebbles should be separated from the\r\nfiner parts by the hand, or by sifting with a very coarse sieve, and\r\nexamined with reference to their mineralogical character, weight and\r\nsize, making note, in this last respect, of the number that are as large\r\nas the fist or larger, the number as large as an egg, a walnut,\r\nhazel-nut, and pea, or give the percentage of each by weight.\r\n\r\nPulverize the air-dried soil in a mortar with a wooden pestle, and\r\nseparate the fine earth by a sieve with meshes three millimeters wide;\r\nthis sieve should have a tightly fitting cover of sheepskin stretched\r\nover a loop, and it should be covered in the same manner underneath, so\r\nthat no dust can escape during the process of sifting.\r\n\r\nWash the pebbles and vegetable fibers remaining on the sieve with water,\r\ndry and weigh the residue; the water with which this gravel was washed\r\nshould be evaporated to dryness at a temperature not exceeding 50°\r\ntowards the close of the evaporation, and the residue mixed with what\r\npassed through the dry sieve.\r\n\r\nThe sifted fine earth is reserved for all the processes hereinafter\r\ndescribed, and is kept in well-stoppered bottles, marked air-dried fine\r\nearth. The sieve mentioned above is too coarse for the more modern\r\nmethods of analysis.\r\n\r\n=83. Wolff=[64] directs that the air-dried earth (in summer dried in\r\nthin layers at room temperature, in winter in ovens at 30° to 50°) be\r\nfreed from all stones, the latter washed, dried, and weighed. The soil\r\nis next passed through a three millimeter mesh sieve, the residual\r\npebbles and fiber washed, dried and weighed. The fine earth passing the\r\nsieve is used for all subsequent examinations. It is air-dried at\r\nmoderate temperatures and preserved in stoppered glass vessels.\r\n\r\n=84. The French=[65] commission calls especial attention to the method\r\nof subsampling, and prescribes that the sample of earth which has been\r\ntaken in the manner indicated, and of which the weight should be greater\r\nas the material is less homogeneous should not be analyzed as a whole.\r\nIt should be divided into two parts. The first includes the finer\r\nparticles constituting the earth, properly so-called, with the elements\r\nwhich alone enter into play in vegetable nutrition and on which it is\r\nnecessary to carry out the analysis. The second embraces the coarser\r\nparticles to which only a superficial examination should be given and\r\nwhich may have a certain importance from a physical point of view but\r\nwhich cannot take any part from a chemical point of view, in the\r\nnutrition of plants. It is, however, useful to examine its mineralogical\r\nconstitution and to look for the useful elements such as lime, potash,\r\netc., which it may be able to furnish to the earth, and in proportion as\r\nit is decomposed, finer particles which may be useful in plant\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\nHow are we to distinguish between the fine and coarse elements? All\r\ngrades of fineness are observed in the soil, from the particles of\r\nhydrated silica so small that with the largest magnifying power of the\r\nmicroscope it is scarcely possible to distinguish them, up to grains of\r\nsand which are of palpable size and visible to the naked eye, and\r\nextending to pebbles of varying sizes. All intermediate stages are found\r\nbetween these and if it should be asked what is the precise limit at\r\nwhich it is necessary to stop in distinguishing the fine from the coarse\r\nelements of the soil, the answer is that this can only be determined by\r\na common understanding among analysts. In general, it may be said, that\r\nthe mark of distinction should be the separation which can be secured\r\nwith a sieve having ten meshes per centimeter.\r\n\r\n=85. Loose Soils.=—Having agreed upon a sieve of the above size, the\r\nprocess of separation in loose soils is as follows: The earth is exposed\r\nto the air and when the touch shows that it is sufficiently dry the\r\nconglomerated particles should be simply divided without breaking the\r\nrocky material which exists in a state of undivided fragments. There are\r\nsome special precautions to be taken. Rubbing in a mortar must be\r\nforbidden since it reduces the earth to particles which are unnatural in\r\nsize, by securing the breaking up of the fragments consisting of the\r\ndébris of rocks. When it is possible the earth should be rubbed simply\r\nin the hand and after having separated that which passes the sieve, the\r\nlarge particles which have not passed should be again rubbed with the\r\nhand, until all the particles which can be loosened by this simple\r\ntreatment have passed the sieve. The separation should be as complete as\r\npossible in order that a sample of the particles passing the sieve\r\nshould represent as nearly as possible, a correct sample of the fine\r\nparticles of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the pebbles, they should be washed with water upon the\r\nsieve in order to carry through the last of the particles of earth\r\nadhering to them. They are then dried and their weight taken. The fine\r\npart of the earth is also weighed. On an aliquot part, say 100 grams,\r\nthe moisture is determined and then by simple calculation the whole\r\nsample of the air-dry soil can be calculated to the dry state. The\r\nsample is then placed in a glass flask.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles are examined with a view of determining their mineralogical\r\nconstitution; as for instance, on being touched with a little\r\nhydrochloric acid it can be determined whether or not they are carbonate\r\nof lime. The nature of the rock from which they have been derived is\r\noften to be determined by a simple inspection.\r\n\r\n=86. Compact Soils.=—If the soils are not sufficiently loose to be\r\ntreated as before described, it is necessary to have recourse to other\r\nmeans of division, which should not, however, be sufficiently energetic\r\nto reduce the rocky elements to fine particles. For this purpose the\r\nearth may be broken by means of a wooden mallet, striking it lightly and\r\nseparating the fine elements from time to time by sifting. A wooden\r\nroller may also be used with a little pressure, for breaking up the\r\nparticles or a roller made out of a large glass bottle. These methods\r\nwill permit of a sufficiently fine division of the soil without breaking\r\nup any of the pebbles. Sometimes, however, a soil can not be broken up\r\nby such treatment. It is then necessary to have recourse to the\r\nfollowing process: The soil is thoroughly moistened and afterwards\r\nrubbed up with water. The paste which is thus formed, is poured upon the\r\nsieve and washed with a stream of water until all the fine particles are\r\nremoved. The wash water and the fine particles are left standing until\r\nthe silt is thoroughly deposited when the supernatant water is poured\r\noff and the deposited moist earth is transferred into a large dish and\r\ndried on a sand or water-bath. In this way a firm paste is formed which\r\ncan be worked up with the hand until rendered homogeneous and afterwards\r\nan aliquot portion be taken to determine moisture.\r\n\r\n=87. Method of Peligot.=—The method recommended by Peligot[66] for the\r\npreparatory treatment of the sample is essentially that already\r\ndescribed. The sample is at first dried in the air and then in an oven\r\nat 120°. When dry and friable 100 grams are placed in a mortar and\r\nrubbed with a wooden pestle. It is then passed through a sieve of ten\r\nmeshes per centimeter. The largest particles which remain in the sieve\r\nshould have about the dimensions of a pin’s head. The stones are\r\nseparated by hand. They should be shaken with water in order to detach\r\nany pulverulent particles adhering thereto. The turbid water resulting\r\nfrom this treatment is added to that which is used in separating the\r\nsand from the impalpable part of the soil.\r\n\r\n=88. Wahnschaffe= prescribes[67] in the further preparation of the\r\nsample for analysis that the coarse pieces up to the size of a walnut be\r\nseparated in the field where the sample is taken and their relative\r\nweight and mineralogical character determined. The soil sample is then\r\nto be placed in linen or strong paper bags and carefully labelled. In\r\norder to avoid any danger of loss of label the description or number of\r\nthe sample should be put on the cloth or paper directly.\r\n\r\nThe sample when brought to the laboratory should be spread out to dry,\r\nin a room free of dust. In the winter the room should be heated to the\r\nusual temperature. The air drying should continue until there is no\r\nsensible loss of weight. The samples then are to be placed in dry,\r\nglass-stoppered glass bottles where they are kept until ready for\r\nexamination. This method of keeping the samples avoids contact with\r\nammonia or acid fumes with which a laboratory is often contaminated.\r\n\r\n=89. The Swedish= chemists[68] direct that samples which are to be used\r\nfor chemical examination in the manner described below, are most\r\nconveniently brought to such a condition of looseness and humidity that\r\nthe soil feels moist when pressed between the fingers without, however,\r\nsticking to the skin. To prepare the sample in this manner, spread it in\r\na large porcelain dish or on a glass plate in a place where it is not\r\nreached by the laboratory atmosphere; stir it frequently till it assumes\r\nthe mentioned humidity (if the sample when sent is too dry, moisten it\r\nwith distilled water till its condition is as indicated); then pulverize\r\ncarefully between the fingers and finally sift through a sieve with five\r\nmillimeter holes. In this way free the sample from stones, undecayed\r\nroots and similar parts of plants, pieces of wood, and other matter\r\nstrange to the soil, which remain on the sieve; mix the sample carefully\r\nand put it into a glass bottle provided with a stopper well ground in;\r\nkeep it in a cool place. Samples prepared in this way will usually\r\ncontain 20–30 per cent moisture; boggy soils 60–80 per cent and peat\r\nsoils 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n=90. Petermann=[69] follows the method below in preparing samples of\r\nsoil for analysis.\r\n\r\nThe soil is gently broken up by a soft pestle and all débris if of\r\norganic nature, cut fine with scissors. About 2500 grams of this soil\r\nare passed through a one millimeter mesh sieve. The organic débris is\r\nremoved by forceps, washed free of adhering earth dried at 120° and\r\nweighed. The nature of the organic débris should be noted as carefully\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles and mineral débris not passing the sieve are worked in a\r\nlarge quantity of water by decantation. They are also dried at 120° and\r\nweighed. This débris is examined mineralogically and thus some idea of\r\nthe origin of the soil obtained.\r\n\r\n=91. The= various methods for the preliminary treatment as practiced by\r\nthe best authorities have been somewhat fully set forth in the foregoing\r\nrésumé. The common object of all these procedures is to get the soil\r\ninto a proper shape for further physical and chemical examination and to\r\ndetermine the comparative weights of foreign bodies contained therein.\r\n\r\nThe essential conditions to be observed are the proper sifting of the\r\nmaterial and avoidance of mechanical communition of the solid particles\r\ntoo large to pass the meshes of the sieve. If possible the material\r\nshould be passed through a sieve of one millimeter mesh. In cases where\r\nthis is impracticable a larger mesh may be used, but as small as will\r\nsecure the necessary separation. Before final chemical analysis a half\r\nmillimeter mesh sieve should be employed if the soil be of a nature\r\nwhich will permit its use. Over-heating of the sample should be avoided.\r\nRapid drying is advisable when the samples are to be examined for\r\nnitrates.\r\n\r\nThe method recommended by the French commissions seems well adapted to\r\nthe general treatment of samples, but the analyst must be guided by\r\ncircumstances in any particular soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   AUTHORITIES CITED IN PART SECOND.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin 38, pp. 61–2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Ms. communication to author.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin No. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  Landwirtschaftliche Versuchs-Stationen, Band 38, Ss. 309 et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Annales de la Science Agronomique, Tome 1, Part 2, p. 240.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Agricultural Chemical Analysis, p. 166.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Zeitschrift für analytische Chemie, Band 3, S. 87.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  Anleitung zur Wissenschaftlichen Bodenuntersuchung, S. 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Traité de Chimie Analytique, p. 149.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin 35, p. 108.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  Op. cit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin 10, p. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Analyse des Matières Agricoles, p. 131.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin 38, p. 200.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  This in some instances would include a part of the subsoil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  All soils do not become friable on drying.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, (2), Vol. 25, p. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Annales de la Science Agronomique, Tome 1, Part Second, pp. 240 et\r\n  seq.

The Soil as a Mass.=—The soil constituted as indicated in the\r\npreceding pages, is now brought to the analyst for investigation. The\r\nproperties with which he first becomes acquainted are those which\r\nimpress his senses as mass characteristics. There is a perception of\r\ncolor, consistence, weight and other features which the soil possesses\r\nas a whole. The several constituents of the soil must first be\r\nconsidered as molecular and mole aggregates. In other words, the soil in\r\nits natural state is a mechanical mixture of particles which must first\r\nbe considered as a whole. The physical properties of the soil,\r\ntherefore, should engage the attention of the analyst before he proceeds\r\nto the investigation of the properties of its several constituents as\r\nclassified by the relative size or hydraulic value of the particles of\r\nwhich they are composed, or to a chemical determination of the compounds\r\nor elements therein contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DETERMINATION OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.\r\n\r\n=93. Color.=—The color of a soil depends chiefly upon the proportion of\r\norganic matter and iron compounds which it contains and the state of\r\nsubdivision of its particles. When a soil contains a large amount of\r\norganic matter, especially when this organic matter is in an advanced\r\nstate of decay, it assumes more or less a black color when moist. This\r\nblack color is to be distinguished from the black alkali tint which is\r\nproduced by the action of carbonate of soda on organic matter. The\r\nnaturally black color of a soil containing a large amount of organic\r\nmatter depends, however, either upon the action of mineral matters upon\r\nthis organic matter, as in the case of the black alkali mentioned, or\r\nupon the blackish color of carbon resulting from the slow combustion of\r\nthe organic matter during the period of decay.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a large amount of ferric oxid in soil gives the\r\nwell-known red color so well-marked in the soils of southwestern\r\nKentucky and other portions of the United States. The preponderance of\r\nsand in a soil tends to produce a light yellow or whitish tint, while\r\ncertain kinds of clay have a bluish tint probably due to the presence of\r\nferrous salts. The influence of the color of the soil upon the color of\r\nthe vegetation is also well-marked, the black soils as a rule producing\r\na much deeper green tint of foliage than the light colored soils. This\r\neffect should not be attributed to color alone for as a matter of fact\r\nhighly colored soils are usually very close and very retentive of\r\nmoisture, which is one reason, probably, for their not being more highly\r\noxidized. Such soils will produce a more vigorous and ranker growth of\r\nvegetation, but it is the texture of the soil and the more moist\r\ncondition which it maintains, rather than the color, which produce the\r\ndeeper green tint of foliage.\r\n\r\nThe color of a soil is also used as an index of its fertility, the black\r\nand red soils being usually the most fertile.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to add here the probable reason as given by Whitney for\r\nthis, _viz._, that the deeper color shows that the oxids of iron and the\r\norganic compounds have less oxygen and indicate that the soils are quite\r\nretentive of moisture and rather tend to the exclusion of air, so that\r\npart of the oxygen of the iron compounds and of the organic matters has\r\nbeen used up in the oxidation processes within the soil. It is known,\r\nfor example, that wood oxidizes much more rapidly around a rusty nail\r\nthan where it is simply exposed to the air, the iron oxid acting as a\r\ncarrier between the oxygen of the air and the organic matter. In a sandy\r\nsoil, on the contrary, where there is usually less moisture and much\r\nfreer circulation of air, the iron compounds have more oxygen and\r\nusually have a light yellow color. If this sand is heated, however, with\r\nthe exclusion of air, and especially in the presence of organic matters,\r\npart of this oxygen will be given off and there will be the same red\r\ncolor as in the heavier clay soils. It is frequently noticed, also, in\r\ncompact clays that where air gains access through cracks or root-holes,\r\nthe color is altogether modified.\r\n\r\n=94. Determination of Color.=—There is no process which will give\r\nexperimentally and accurately the color of a soil sample. The changes\r\nwhich the color of a soil undergoes in passing from a saturated to an\r\nanhydrous state are well-marked. The analyst will have to be content\r\nwith giving as nearly as possible a description of the color of the\r\nsample when taken and the changes which it undergoes in air drying or on\r\nheating in a bath to 100°–110°, or in heating to redness with or without\r\nexclusion of the air. These changes in color will give some indication\r\nof the character of the organic and mineral matters present.\r\n\r\n=95. Odoriferous Matters in Soil.=—It is known that the soil emits a\r\npeculiar odor which is not disagreeable except when it has been recently\r\nwet, for instance, after a short rain. Several attempts have been made\r\nto discover the nature of this odor. These researches have established\r\nthe fact that the essential principle of this odor resides in an organic\r\ncompound of a neutral nature of the aromatic family and which is carried\r\nby the vapor of water after the manner of a body possessing a feeble\r\ntension. The odor is penetrating, almost piquant, and analogous to that\r\nof camphorated and quite distinct from other known substances. In regard\r\nto the quantity of this substance, it is extremely minute and can be\r\nregarded as being only a few millionths of a per cent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Berthelot and André[70] this new principle is neither an\r\nacid nor an alkali nor even a normal aldehyd. It is, in a concentrated\r\naqueous solution, precipitable by potassium carbonate with the\r\nproduction of a resinous substance. Heated with potash it develops a\r\nsharp odor similar to the aldehyde resin. It does not reduce the\r\nammoniacal nitrate of silver. Treated with potash and iodin it gives an\r\nabundant formation of iodoform, which, however, is a property common to\r\na great number of substances. For the qualitative and quantitative\r\nestimation of the odoriferous matter the following process is employed:\r\n\r\nAbout three kilograms of the soil are mixed with sand containing a small\r\namount of carbonate of lime and some humic substance; after having freed\r\nit from all organic débris which is visible, it is placed in a glass\r\nalembic. The soil should contain from ten to twelve per cent of water at\r\nleast. The alembic is placed in a sand bath and is kept at 60° for\r\nseveral hours. The water evaporated is condensed until about\r\nseventy-five cubic centimeters are distilled over. This distilled water\r\nis again rectified so as to obtain in all about twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters. The odoriferous matter appears to be nearly all contained\r\nin this twenty cubic centimeters. The liquid thus obtained shows an\r\nalkaline reaction; it contains some ammonia and reduces ammoniacal\r\nsilver nitrate. This last reaction is due to some pyridic alkali or\r\nanalogue thereof, and is cause for it to be distilled anew with a trace\r\nof sulfuric acid which gives a neutral liquor deprived of all reducing\r\naction but which preserves the odor peculiar to the soil. The twenty\r\ncubic centimeters obtained as before are subjected to two additional\r\ndistillations and in the final one only one cubic centimeter of liquid\r\nis distilled over.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar odor is intensified proportionately as the volume of the\r\nliquid is decreased. To this one cubic centimeter, is added some pure\r\ncrystallized potassium carbonate. The liquor is immediately troubled and\r\nsome hours are required for it to become clear again. Meanwhile there is\r\nformed upon its surface a resinous ring almost invisible, amounting at\r\nmost to from ten to twenty milligrams of a matter which has not been\r\nidentified with any known principle. The reactions described above,\r\nhowever, permit of its general character being known. This resinous\r\nmatter contains the odoriferous principle, the composition of which is\r\nnot yet definitely known.\r\n\r\n=96. Specific Gravity.=—The density of a soil depends on its\r\ncomposition, the fineness of its particles and upon the packing which it\r\nhas received. It has in other words an apparent and a real specific\r\ngravity. It is easy to see that a soil in good tilth would weigh less\r\nper cubic foot than one which had been pressed closely together, as in a\r\nroad or well-pastured field. Ordinary soils in good tilth have an\r\napparent specific gravity of about 1.2, and when entirely free from air,\r\na real specific gravity of about 2.5. If the apparent specific gravity\r\nof a soil sample were 1.2 and the air were removed, leaving a vacuum in\r\nthe interstices of the soil, the apparent specific gravity would not be\r\nsensibly increased. The figure 1.2 is the apparent specific gravity of a\r\nmixture of soil material which is about 2½ times heavier than water, and\r\nof an extremely small proportion by weight of air which is about 1000\r\ntimes lighter than water. The figure 2.5 is about the true specific\r\ngravity of the real soil material, and shows that this material is about\r\n2½ times heavier than an equal volume of water.\r\n\r\nThe weights of a cubic foot of different kinds of soil as given by\r\nSchübler[71] are as follows;\r\n\r\n                                         Pounds.\r\n                      Sand                    110\r\n                      Sand and clay            96\r\n                      Common arable soil 80 to 90\r\n                      Heavy clay               75\r\n                      Vegetable mold           78\r\n                      Peat               30 to 50\r\n\r\nIn general the specific gravity of soil decreases inversely as its\r\ncontent of humus.\r\n\r\n=97. Determination of Specific Gravity.=—The ordinary method of\r\nproceeding to determine the true specific gravity is by means of a\r\npyknometer. The pyknometer should have a capacity of from twenty-five to\r\nfifty cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nFrom ten to fifteen grams of earth dried to constant weight at 100° are\r\ntaken, boiled for a time with a few cubic centimeters of water to remove\r\nair and poured into the pyknometer. All soil particles are washed out of\r\nthe vessel in which the boiling took place into the pyknometer with\r\nfreshly boiled distilled water and after cooling to the temperature at\r\nwhich the calibration took place, the pyknometer is filled with\r\ndistilled water at the given temperature and weighed. If the soil\r\ncontain materials soluble in water, alcohol of definitely known specific\r\ngravity may be employed and the number thus obtained calculated to a\r\nwater basis.\r\n\r\nThe calculations when water is used are made as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                               Grams.\r\n   Weight of pyknometer                                       13.4789\r\n    „     „  pyknometer full of distilled water at 20°        62.8934\r\n    „     „  water in pyknometer                              49.4145\r\n    „     „  dry soil taken                                   10.0000\r\n    „     „  pyknometer + dry soil + filled with water at 20° 67.9834\r\n    „     „  soil and water                                   54.5045\r\n    „     „  water                                            44.5045\r\n    „     „  water displaced by ten grams soil                 4.9100\r\n\r\nThen specific gravity = 10.000 ÷ 4.9100 = 2.04.\r\n\r\n=98. Specific Gravity of Undried Soils.=—It is often desirable to\r\ndetermine the specific gravity of an undried portion of the soil. For\r\nthis purpose a portion of the sample is dried at 100° to determine its\r\npercentage of moisture. The specific gravity is then determined on a ten\r\ngram sample of the undried soil as just given. The actual weight of soil\r\ntaken is calculated from the percentage of moisture obtained in the\r\nfirst instance. In the case given if the percentage of moisture at 100°\r\nbe ten then the actual weight of dry soil taken is nine grams. This\r\nnumber is therefore used in making the calculations. In all statements\r\nof specific gravity taken in the manner described the temperature at\r\nwhich the pyknometer is calibrated should be stated and all weighings\r\nwhere water is involved made at that degree.\r\n\r\n=99. Volume of Soil.=—If it be desired to calculate the volume occupied\r\nby a soil it is easily done by dividing the weight of water displaced by\r\nthe weight of one cubic centimeter of water of the temperature at which\r\nthe determination took place.\r\n\r\nIn the case given one cubic centimeter of water at 20° weighs 0.998259.\r\nThen 4.9100 ÷ 0.998259 = 4.9186 cubic centimeters = volume occupied by\r\nten grams of dry soil excluding interstitial spaces between particles.\r\n\r\n=100. Volumetric Methods.=—The water displaced by a given weight of soil\r\nmay also be measured volumetrically by the method of Knop.[72]\r\n\r\nPlace 200 grams of the soil in a flask of from three to five hundred\r\ncubic centimeters capacity. Add a measured quantity of water, and shake\r\nthoroughly to eliminate air, and fill up to the mark from a burette. The\r\nquantity of water required to complete the volume subtracted from the\r\nnumber expressing the volume of the flask will give the volume of water\r\ndisplaced by the earth.\r\n\r\nAnother method consists in thoroughly shaking about thirty grams of the\r\nsoil in a graduated cylinder with fifty cubic centimeters of water\r\ncontaining a little ammonium chlorid and after twenty-four hours\r\nrecording the volume occupied by the whole. The increase in volume over\r\nfifty cubic centimeters shows the quantity of water displaced. This\r\nmethod may also be used to determine the volume occupied by a soil when\r\nsaturated with water. The above methods are only to be used when\r\napproximately correct results are all that are desired.\r\n\r\n=101. Apparent Specific Gravity.=—The apparent specific gravity of a\r\nsoil is obtained by dividing its volume, interstitial spaces included,\r\nby the weight of an equal volume of water.\r\n\r\nThe real and apparent specific gravities of six samples of soil are\r\ngiven below.[73]\r\n\r\n Real specific gravity   2.5445, 2.6315, 2.6508, 2.6400, 2.7325,  2.6603\r\n Apparent specific\r\n   gravity of air-dried\r\n   soil                  1.0940, 1.1710, 1.3570, 1.2810, 1.4060,  1.2730\r\n Apparent specific\r\n   gravity of soil dried\r\n   at 125°               1.0990, 1.1770, 1.3750, 1.2910, 1.4640,  1.2850\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that in computing the apparent specific gravity of a\r\nsoil dried at 125° the volume occupied by the water is assumed to occupy\r\nthe same space as if it existed in a free state. The volume of this\r\nwater is therefore to be subtracted from the contents of the flask\r\nbefore proceeding with the computations.\r\n\r\n=102. Determination of Apparent Specific Gravity.=—Place in small\r\nquantity portions of the air-dried sample properly prepared, into an\r\nopen glass cylinder, holding one liter, and about 170 millimeters high\r\n(if the height is exactly the mentioned one, the diameter of the\r\ncylinder will be 86.6 millimeters); pack the sample by striking the\r\nbottom of the cylinder hard against the palm of the hand after each new\r\nfilling; close the cylinder thus filled by a glass plate and weigh on a\r\nbalance sensitive to 0.1 gram; deduct the weight of the cylinder and\r\nglass plate, and the weight of one liter of soil in approximately\r\nsimilar conditions as it is found on the dry land prepared for\r\ncultivation, is thus ascertained. The weight of one liter of the soil in\r\ngrams multiplied by 2000 will give in kilograms the weight of the\r\nsurface soil from a hectare (2.47 acres) of the field from which the\r\nsample is taken when the depth of this is calculated at twenty\r\ncentimeters.[74]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     RELATION OF THE SOIL TO HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=103. Sources of Soil Heat.=—The heat of the soil comes from three\r\nsources, _viz._: solar heat, as the sun’s rays, heat of chemical and\r\nvital action within the soil, and the original heat of the earth’s\r\ninterior. The latter is sensibly a constant quantity, and of great value\r\nto plants. The heat of chemical and vital action is not great in amount\r\nexcept in a few special cases but is often, as in germination, of the\r\ngreatest importance to plant growth. The sun, therefore, remains the\r\ngreatest source of heat of practical importance in relation to the\r\nproduction of crops. Dark-colored soils, absorbing most and radiating\r\nthe fewest rays, must attain the highest temperature. Schübler’s\r\nclassical researches on soil temperatures, show that there is at times a\r\ndifference of over 7° in temperature between white and black soils, all\r\nother conditions being alike. Schübler’s researches, being made on dry\r\nsoils in the laboratory, do not, however, apply wholly to conditions in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n=104. Influence of Specific Heat.=—The heat which a soil receives and\r\nretains is largely due to the specific heat of the soil. The specific\r\nheat of a body is expressed by a number which shows the amount of heat\r\nnecessary to raise a given weight of the body 1° of temperature, as\r\ncompared with the amount necessary to raise the same weight of water 1°.\r\nThe specific heat of the soil is usually between 0.20 and 0.25, while\r\nthat of water taken as the standard is unity.\r\n\r\n=105. Influence of Moisture.=—The moisture of the soil possesses great\r\ninfluence on the soil temperature, so much so that a dry, light-colored\r\nsoil may attain a greater degree of warmth than a moist, dark-colored\r\none. The action of water in reducing soil temperature is easily\r\nexplained. In our latitude, we see the water in all its forms, solid,\r\nliquid, and gaseous, and we know that these forms are the direct result\r\nof temperature. The changing of water from the solid to the liquid or\r\ngaseous form is performed at the expense of heat; the more water\r\nevaporated from the soil the more heat must be used for the evaporation.\r\nTherefore, the more water contained in the soil at any given time the\r\nlower must be its temperature during subsequent exposure to sun heat\r\nbecause of the greater evaporation. The experiments of Liebenberg,\r\nPattner, Schübler and Dickenson have practically settled all the\r\nquestions of soil temperatures. The radiation of heat from the soil, and\r\nthe consequent cooling propensity of the latter, are directly\r\nproportional to the absorptive power of the soil. Two soils of like\r\nabsorptive power towards heat possess, as a rule, equal radiating power.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, it can be said the greater the heating capacity and\r\nconductivity of a soil the more readily and rapidly does it give off its\r\nheat and become cooled.\r\n\r\n=106. Absorption of Solar Heat.=—The quantity of heat absorbed from the\r\nsun by the earth is an important factor in the growth of vegetation. As\r\nhas been established in the physics of heat, a black surface, other\r\nthings being equal, will absorb a larger amount of heat than one of any\r\nother color; so, other things being equal in the physical and chemical\r\ncomposition of a soil, variations in the amount of organic matter\r\nproducing greater or less black coloration will affect the heat\r\nabsorption. Thus, black soils, in the conditions above mentioned, will\r\nabsorb more heat than lighter colored soils. As a result, the vegetation\r\nin such soils gets an earlier start in the Spring and matures more\r\nrapidly. As an illustration of this it may be noted that the black\r\nprairie soils of Iowa produce uniformly crops of maize which are matured\r\nbefore the early frosts, while crops grown on lighter soils much farther\r\nSouth often suffer injury from that source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DETERMINATION OF SPECIFIC HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=107. General Principles.=—The quantity of heat stored in any given\r\nweight of soil is capable of being measured and compared with the\r\nquantity stored in an equal weight of water at the same temperature. The\r\nease, however, with which disturbing influences operate during the\r\ndetermination makes the manipulation somewhat difficult. The specific\r\nheat of the containing vessels must be carefully determined. Fortunately\r\nthis has been done for most materials and the data thus obtained are\r\nrecorded in standard works on physics. The material operated on must be\r\nprotected from thermal influences from sources not controlled by the\r\nexperiment and even the heat of the operator’s body may often disturb\r\nthe conduct of the work. The general conditions which should control the\r\nexperiment as well as the details thereof are given in the following\r\nmethod which, however, the ingenious analyst may profitably simplify.\r\n\r\n=108. Method of Pfaundler.=—The process of estimating the specific heat\r\nof soils by the method of mixture, is essentially that of Regnault and\r\nis described as follows by Pfaundler[75].\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used is illustrated in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nA and A′ show the heating apparatus. It consists of a vessel of sheet\r\niron in which a test tube E is fixed by means of a cork. The test tube\r\nholds the soil whose specific heat is to be determined. The apparatus\r\ncontains water, which is brought to the boiling point by means of a\r\nlamp, and the excess of steam is conducted away, as indicated in the\r\nfigure, through one of the axes of the apparatus; the opposite axis is,\r\nof course, closed. It requires about thirty-five minutes boiling to\r\nbring the contents of the test tube to the temperature of the aqueous\r\nvapor. The exact temperature at which the water boils is determined by\r\nobserving the barometer at the time and consulting a table of the\r\nboiling temperature of water at different barometric pressures.\r\n\r\nThe calorimeter is shown in the figures B and B′. It consists of a\r\nwooden box closed on one side by a glass plate G and on the other to the\r\nheighth F by a small board on which a calorimeter of ordinary\r\nconstruction is placed. The cylinder of the calorimeter is seventy\r\nmillimeters high and forty-seven millimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 13.\r\n\r\n  REGNAULT’S APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF SOILS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis part of the apparatus is supported by triangular pieces of cork. A\r\ndelicate thermometer is fastened to the top of the box of the\r\ncalorimeter and the value of the degrees is so arranged that about\r\ntwelve of them correspond to about one degree C. The scale of the\r\ninstrument can be arbitrarily fixed and the temperature of any part of\r\nit determined by comparison with a delicately graduated thermometer.\r\n\r\nNear the thermometer in the calorimeter is a stirrer made of a very thin\r\ncopper disk with a bent rim. This stirrer is operated by means of a silk\r\ncord moved by appropriate machinery.\r\n\r\nThe reading of the thermometer is made through a glass plate and this\r\nshould be protected from the heat of the body of the observer by a paper\r\nscreen.\r\n\r\nThe test tube E is first filled with the substance, whose specific heat\r\nis to be determined, and weighed. It is then placed in the water bath\r\nuntil constant weight is reached. After constant weight has been\r\nobtained the apparatus is again dried and the exact weight of the\r\nmoisture lost thus determined. The test tube is then placed in the\r\napparatus A closed with a well-fitted cork, the top covered with cotton\r\nand heated in the aqueous vapor for about one hour. The heating\r\napparatus should be far removed from the calorimeter so that the\r\ntemperature of the latter cannot be influenced thereby. Meanwhile the\r\ncalorimeter is filled with water which has stood in the room for a long\r\ntime until it has acquired, as nearly as possible, the room temperature.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water is such that the water value of the whole of the\r\ncalorimeter together with the immersed portions of the thermometer and\r\nstirrer shall amount to exactly 100 grams. A few minutes before bringing\r\nthe substance into the calorimeter, the stirring apparatus is put in\r\nmotion and the temperature observations are commenced. These should be\r\nat intervals of twenty seconds and should be continued until ten\r\nobservations have been made. Meanwhile the height of the barometer is\r\nalso read. A few seconds before the tenth interval the apparatus A is\r\nbrought quickly to the calorimeter and its contents emptied into it at\r\nthe moment of the tenth interval. The apparatus A should be removed as\r\nquickly as possible after its contents are emptied.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of the substance and its thorough incorporation\r\nwith the water of the calorimeter by the stirring apparatus, the\r\nthermometer is again read, at intervals of twenty seconds, until its\r\nmaximum has been reached and as much longer thereafter as may be\r\nnecessary to show that an appreciable fall of temperature has taken\r\nplace. The test tube, in which the substance was heated is weighed and\r\nthe exact quantity of the added substance thus determined.\r\n\r\nIn order that the sample of soil may be easily removed from the test\r\ntube in which it is heated, it is best to have it molded into\r\nappropriate forms before being placed in the heating tube. This is\r\neasily accomplished by pressing it into molds of convenient shape and of\r\na size so that six or eight pieces (best of cylindrical shape) will be\r\nnecessary to give the quantity sufficient for the experiment. Since some\r\nsoils will not retain their shape after molding, the molds may be made\r\nof zinc foil whose water values in the calorimeter are previously\r\ndetermined and they can be placed with their contents in the calorimeter\r\nthus securing the total immersion of all the particles of soil in the\r\nwater. With very dusty materials, it is necessary that these little\r\ncylinders should be closed with pieces of foil at the ends in order to\r\nprevent the particles of dust from escaping and rising to the surface of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nAnother source of error consists in the solution of the soluble salts\r\nwhich the soil may contain. This is avoided by the use of turpentine\r\ninstead of water. If the cylinder containing the soil be made\r\nwater-tight, this danger from the solubility of the salts in water is\r\navoided. Another method of correcting these errors is in making a blank\r\nexperiment in which a quantity of the earth taken is kept at the\r\ntemperature of the water in the calorimeter until both are of the same\r\ntemperature. The earth is then mixed with the water and the change of\r\ntemperature produced noted. In this way the corrections made necessary\r\nby the solution of the salts in water and other causes are determined.\r\n\r\n=109. Method of Calculating Results.=—Let t represent the mean\r\ntemperature of the beginning period of the experiment, and v equal the\r\nloss in heat per interval. Let t′ and v′ represent the same values for\r\nthe end period. Let θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, etc., represent the temperature at the\r\nend of the first, second and third intervals of the middle period and θ₀\r\nthe temperature at the beginning of the middle period and θₙ the end\r\ntemperature of of the middle period. Let τ₁, τ₂, τ₃, ... τₙ, represent\r\nthe mean temperature of the single intervals; then τ₁ = (Θ₀ + Θ₁)/(2);\r\nτ₂ = (Θ₁ + Θ₂)/(2), and τₙ = (Θ_{n–1} + Θₙ)/(2). The constant C\r\nrepresents the correction which must be applied in order to determine\r\nthe true increase of temperature in the calorimetric system. The\r\nexpression θₙ − θ₀ + C represents the true temperature increase of the\r\ncalorimetric system which we may represent by Δθ and θₙ + C represents\r\nthe true maximum, that is, the end temperature, which by exclusion of\r\nexternal influences is reached. The correction C, as already indicated,\r\nis to be added to θₙ − θ₀ when it is positive and is to be subtracted\r\ntherefrom when it is negative. The numerical value of C is usually very\r\nsmall, and, in the experiments indicated, varied between zero and one\r\ndivision of the thermometer employed, that is it seldom exceeded one\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n=110. Illustration.=—The method of determining value of specific heat is\r\nbest illustrated by an example:\r\n\r\nIn one determination the water value of the calorimetric system,\r\nincluding stirrer and thermometer was 2.50 grams, the weight of water\r\nadded was 97.50 grams and the total water value of the system 100 grams.\r\nThe substance was dried at 100° and weighed in five envelopes:\r\n\r\n               Total weight                31.423 grams.\r\n               The envelopes alone weighed 10.654   „\r\n               Weight of the soil taken    20.769   „\r\n\r\nThe envelopes holding the soil were made of brass with zinc ends, the\r\nspecific heat of which is 0.0939 and the water value of the whole of the\r\nenvelopes was 1.0004 grams. Since, however, the ends were soldered on\r\nwith zinc the true water value was somewhat smaller being equal to\r\n0.8692 gram. The data of the observations were as follows:\r\n\r\n         Corrected height of barometer      699.6 millimeters.\r\n         Intervals between the observations    20 seconds.\r\n\r\n                  No. of        Temperature on the\r\n               Observations.  arbitrary scale of the\r\n                                   thermometer.\r\n First Period            { 0          162°.6\r\n       „                 {10          162°.9           = θ₀ (Moment of\r\n                                                         immersion.)\r\n\r\n Second Period           {11          185°.0\r\n       „                 {12          200°.0\r\n       „                 {13          206°.1\r\n       „                 {14          209°.5\r\n       „                 {15          210°.7\r\n       „                 {16          211°.3\r\n       „                 {17          211°.5             Differences.\r\n       „                 {18          211°.5                  0\r\n       „                 {19          211°.5                  0\r\n       „                 {20          211°.5                  0\r\n       „                 {21          211°.5                  0\r\n       „                 {22          211°.4                –0°.1\r\n                                                             = θₙ\r\n                                                            –0°.1\r\n                                                            –0°.1\r\n Third Period            {23          211°.3\r\n       „                 {24          211°.2                –0°.1\r\n       „                 {25          211°.1                –0°.1\r\n       „                 {26          211°.0                –0°.1\r\n       „                 {27          210°.9                –0°.1\r\n       „                 {28          210°.8                –0°.1\r\n       „                 {29          210°.6                –0°.2\r\n       „                 {30          210°.5                –0°.1\r\n\r\nFrom the twenty-second interval, the regular fall of temperature begins\r\nand 211°.4 is therefore taken as θₙ. The mean temperature of the\r\nbeginning period is therefore (162°.6 + 162°.9)/(2) = 162°.75 = t. The\r\nvalue of v is (162°.6 − 162°.9)/(10) = –0°.03. For the end period the\r\nvalue of t′ is (211°.4 + 210°.5)/(2) = 210°.95 and the value of v′ is\r\n(211.4 − 210.5)/(8) = + 0.11. Then the sum of the observations from\r\neleven to twenty-one inclusive = Σ′_{n–1}θ = 2280.1\r\n\r\n           (θ₀ + θₙ)/(2) =                         187.15\r\n           The sum =                              2467.25\r\n           nt =                                   1953.00\r\n           Difference                              514.25\r\n           This difference multiplied by v − v′ =    0.14\r\n           gives a product equal to                71.995\r\n           This product divided by t′ − t =         48.20\r\n           gives a quotient equal to                 1.49\r\n           nv =                                     –0.36\r\n           The sum =                                 1.13 = C\r\n\r\nThen Δθ = θₙ − θ₀ + C = 211°.4 − 162°.9 + 1°.13 = 49°.63. The true end\r\ntemperature = θₙ + C = 212°.53. The zero point of the thermometer =\r\n24°.70, and the actual rise of temperature = 187°.83. The rise of\r\ntemperature due to the proximity of the warming apparatus at the\r\nbeginning was found by experiment to be equal to 0°.1 of the division of\r\nthe scale. On comparing the thermometer used with a standard centigrade\r\nscale it was found that one division of the calorimetric thermometer was\r\nequal to 0°.0858. Converting these numbers into expressions of the\r\ncentigrade scale we have the following summary:\r\n\r\n The true rise of temperature, Δθ =                                4°.25\r\n The true end temperature, θₙ + C =                               16°.10\r\n The temperature of the steam, as determined by the height of the\r\n   barometer, was equal to                                        97°.70\r\n\r\nFrom these data the specific heat is calculated according to the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n    Σ = 1/20.769 × ((100 × 4.25)/(97.70 − 16.10) − 0.8692) = 0.2089.\r\n\r\nFrom this formula the following rule for calculating specific heat is\r\ndeduced:\r\n\r\nMultiply the water value of the calorimetric system by the true rise in\r\ntemperature in degrees Celsius and divide the product by the difference\r\nbetween the temperature of boiling water under the conditions of the\r\nexperiment and the true end temperature. From the quotient subtract the\r\nwater value of the envelopes holding the soil sample. Divide the\r\nremainder by the weight of soil taken.\r\n\r\n=111. Variations in Specific Heat.=—Different soils deport themselves\r\nvery differently in respect of specific heat. In a large number of soils\r\nexamined by Pfaundler, the specific heats were found to vary from 0.19\r\nto 0.51. The highest specific heat was observed in the case of a peaty\r\nsoil. Next to peaty soils came those soils which were highest in humus,\r\nand in general it was found that the specific heat varied directly with\r\nthe humus content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SOIL THERMOMETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=112. General Principles.=—The measurement of the temperature of the\r\nsoil at stated depths is often of use in analytical processes connected\r\nwith agricultural chemistry and physics. The general principles on which\r\nthe process rests, depend on bringing the bulb of the thermometer into\r\nas intimate contact as possible with the particles of soil at the depth\r\nrequired, disturbing as little as possible the normal state of the soil\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nIn the thermometer chiefly used for this purpose in this country, the\r\nstem is strong and carries the degrees figured on the glass. The whole\r\nis inclosed in a wooden case which is cut away to expose the face of the\r\nscale. The scale is about eleven inches long. The part which enters the\r\nsoil is of varying lengths, according to the depth at which the\r\ntemperature is desired.\r\n\r\n=113. Method of Procedure.=—An excellent method of determining soil\r\ntemperatures and of recording results is well illustrated by Frear.[76]\r\n\r\nThe thermometers are set in niches cut in a trench, the earth being\r\nafterwards carefully tamped about the bulbs to secure a good contact,\r\nthe trench being filled at the same time. The surface of the soil is\r\nfreed from vegetation and kept in good tilth.\r\n\r\nThe depths at which observations are made are at the surface and one,\r\nthree, six, twelve, and twenty-four inches. The soil tested was\r\nmoderately dark and loamy to a depth of seven inches and below that a\r\nstiff clay. Solid rock existed at from five to seven feet below the\r\nsurface. Readings were made three times a day.\r\n\r\n=114. Method of Stating Results.=—The individual readings of the\r\nthermometers should be entered at the time they are made. At the end of\r\neach month the mean of the readings should be determined, together with\r\nthe maxima and minima, and a comparison made between the mean readings\r\nof the temperature of the air and maxima and minima. As a sample of the\r\nmethod of stating these mean results the data are given for the month of\r\nMay, 1891, for the atmosphere, surface, and for the depths mentioned\r\nabove:\r\n\r\n                                 MAY.\r\n                                            T° Fahrenheit.\r\n             ATMOSPHERE.\r\n               Monthly mean                           57.1\r\n                 Maximum                              85.0\r\n                 Minimum                              31.0\r\n               Mean daily range                       22.5\r\n               Greatest daily range                   32.0\r\n               Least daily range                       8.0\r\n             SURFACE.\r\n               Monthly mean                           56.7\r\n             _Extremes._\r\n               Maximum (10th of month)                77.0\r\n               Minimum (5th)                          36.0\r\n               Mean maximum                           65.2\r\n               Mean minimum                           49.9\r\n             _Range._\r\n               Monthly                                41.0\r\n               Mean daily                             14.9\r\n               Greatest daily (19th)                  25.0\r\n               Least daily (21st)                      4.0\r\n             ONE INCH.\r\n               Monthly mean                           56.8\r\n             _Extremes._\r\n               Maximum (10th)                         74.5\r\n               Minimum (5th)                          36.5\r\n               Mean maximum                           62.9\r\n               Mean minimum                           49.5\r\n             _Range._\r\n               Monthly                                38.0\r\n               Mean daily                             11.9\r\n               Greatest daily (10 and 19)             20.0\r\n               Least daily (23rd)                      1.0\r\n             THREE INCHES.\r\n               Monthly mean                           56.7\r\n             _Extremes._\r\n               Maximum (31st)                         71.0\r\n               Minimum (6th)                          40.0\r\n               Mean maximum                           60.9\r\n               Mean minimum                           49.7\r\n             _Range._\r\n               Monthly                                31.0\r\n               Mean daily                              9.3\r\n               Greatest daily (19th)                  15.5\r\n               Least daily (23rd)                      1.5\r\n             SIX INCHES.\r\n               Monthly mean                           56.3\r\n             _Extremes._\r\n               Maximum (31st)                         66.0\r\n               Minimum (6th and 7th)                  43.0\r\n               Mean maximum                           56.7\r\n               Mean minimum                           53.2\r\n             _Range._\r\n               Monthly                                23.0\r\n               Mean daily                             4.65\r\n               Greatest daily (8 and 19)               8.5\r\n               Least Daily (5th)                       1.0\r\n             TWELVE INCHES.\r\n               Monthly mean                           55.6\r\n             _Extremes._\r\n               Maximum (31st)                         64.0\r\n               Minimum (6th and 7th)                  46.0\r\n               Mean maximum                           56.6\r\n               Mean minimum                           54.4\r\n             _Range._\r\n               Monthly                                18.0\r\n               Mean daily                             2.18\r\n               Greatest daily (8th)                    4.5\r\n               Least daily (3rd and 20th)              0.0\r\n             TWENTY-FOUR INCHES.\r\n               Monthly mean                           53.1\r\n             _Extremes._\r\n               Maximum (31st)                         58.0\r\n               Minimum (6th and 8th)                  48.0\r\n               Mean maximum                           53.4\r\n               Mean minimum                           52.8\r\n             _Range._\r\n               Monthly                                10.0\r\n               Mean daily                             0.48\r\n               Greatest daily (23rd)                   2.0\r\n               Least daily (on 12 days)                0.0\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14. SOIL THERMOMETER—Whitney and Marvin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=115. Method of Whitney and Marvin.=[77]—The thermometer devised by\r\nWhitney and Marvin is shown in Fig. 14. The principle on which this\r\nmodification depends is as follows:\r\n\r\nA mercurial thermometer of the ordinary construction is liable to give\r\nwrong indications of the temperature because it is difficult to\r\ndetermine the temperature of the column of mercury from the bulb to the\r\nsurface of the ground. To avoid this source of error the thermometer\r\nfigured was constructed.\r\n\r\nThe bulb of the thermometer is made quite small and a slender portion of\r\nthe stem extends into its spherical portion. The top portion of the\r\nthermometer stem does not differ in any essential respect from the stem\r\nof an ordinary thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe bulb is almost wholly filled with alcohol, which acts as the\r\nprincipal thermometric fluid and has the advantages of a high\r\ncoefficient of expansion. The thermometer bulb and the stem of the\r\nthermometer up to a point convenient for graduation, are filled with\r\nmercury. In the drawing the mercury is represented by the heavy black\r\nmarking in and just above the small bulb. The peculiar construction at\r\nthis point is for the purpose of retaining the mercury about the point\r\nof the slender capillary stem inside the bulb and preventing the\r\nentrance of alcohol into the stem when the thermometer is horizontal.\r\n\r\nIn order to register the maximum and minimum temperatures a short column\r\nof alcohol is placed in the upper portion of the stem, above the\r\nmercury, and within this are arranged two small steel indexes, so\r\nconstructed that they will not slide in the tube of their own weight,\r\nbut are easily pushed upward by the mercury column or pulled downward by\r\nthe top meniscus of the alcohol column. The indexes are set by means of\r\na small magnet, the one being drawn down upon the top of the mercurial\r\ncolumn and the other raised up against the meniscus of the alcohol\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the mercury carries its index upward, leaving it to register\r\nthe highest point reached, while the alcohol meniscus withdraws the\r\nother index and leaves it at a point representing the minimum\r\ntemperature. It remains only to mention that the graduations are fixed\r\nin the usual way, having reference only to the positions of the\r\nmercurial column. Beyond the highest point supposed to be reached by the\r\nmercury, say about 120°, the graduations are extended in an arbitrary\r\nmanner. The scale numbers represent temperatures by the mercurial column\r\nand are continued in regular sequence beyond the 120°. On this plan the\r\nreadings for minimum temperatures are on a purely arbitrary scale and\r\nare converted into true degrees of temperature by use of a table\r\nprepared for each thermometer, which table embodies as well all the\r\ncorrections for instrumental error.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the alcohol columns above the mercurial column and\r\nthe indexes are shown enlarged at one side of the illustration. The\r\nreadings of the maximum temperature are made from the bottom end of the\r\nindex next to the mercurial column. The minimum temperature is the\r\nreading of the top of the uppermost index. Thus in the figure the\r\nmaximum temperature indicated is 76.5°, and the minimum 125.7°, which,\r\nby reference to the table of correction for this thermometer, No. 10, is\r\nfound to be 53.3°.\r\n\r\nThe use of mercury in the stem of the thermometer not only admits of the\r\nuse of the index for registering the maximum temperature, but possesses\r\nthe additional advantage of reducing the error due to uncertain\r\ntemperature of the stem to about one-sixth what it would be if alcohol\r\nwere used. Moreover, if necessary, as in the case with thermometers for\r\ngreater depths than that figured, the ungraduated portion of the stem\r\ncan be made of very much finer bore than the graduated portion, the\r\neffect of which is to diminish the objectionable error to a\r\ncomparatively unimportant quantity.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to thermometers of this construction is the\r\nliability of alcohol getting from the bulb into the stem during the\r\nprocesses of construction, graduation and subsequent handling, and the\r\ndifficulty of safely shipping them.\r\n\r\nWhen once set up, however, there seems to be little or no possibility of\r\nderangement and the error common to mercurial thermometers due to rise\r\nof the freezing point with age does not apply owing to the high\r\ncoefficient of expansion of the alcohol used in the bulb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   APPLICATIONS OF SOIL THERMOMETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=116. Estimation of the Absorption of Heat by Soils.=—A cubical zinc\r\nbox, six centimeters square, is filled with the sifted air dried soil.\r\nThe box, one side of which is left open, is encased snugly in a wooden\r\ncover, exposing only the open end, and placed for a few hours in the\r\ndirect rays of the sun. The temperature is then taken at a given depth.\r\nThe box may be provided with thermometers at different depths, the bulbs\r\nthereof extending to the center. In this case the box should be covered\r\nwith thick felt instead of wood. The temperature of the layers of soils\r\nof different depths can thus be read off directly. The air temperature\r\ndirectly above the box should be accurately noted while the experiment\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\nAny other kind of box well protected against all heat save the direct\r\nsunlight on the open surface of the soil will answer as well as the one\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nTo determine the action of moist earth in similar conditions the soil\r\nmay be previously moistened; the per cent of moisture being determined\r\nin a separate portion of the soil or the amount of water added to the\r\nair-dried soil being noted.\r\n\r\n=117. Estimation of the Conductivity of Soils for Heat.=—The bulb of a\r\nthermometer is placed in the middle of a mass of fine earth which is\r\nthen exposed, best in a metallic box painted with lamp black, in a warm\r\nplace. The time required for the thermometer to reach a certain degree\r\nis noted. By reversing the experiment and placing the mass of earth\r\nheated to a given degree in a cool place the conductivity can be\r\ndetermined by the time required for the mercury in the thermometer to\r\nfall to any given point.\r\n\r\nThe experiment may also be made by packing the soil by gently jolting it\r\nin a glass tube six to eight centimeters in diameter. One end of the\r\ntube is closed with a piece of metal or fine wire gauze painted with\r\nlamp black and is exposed to the source of heat. The bulb of a\r\nthermometer is placed at a given distance from the end of the tube and\r\nthe time for the mercury to be affected observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    COHESION AND ADHESION OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=118. Behavior of Soil After Wetting.=—The deportment of a soil when\r\nthoroughly wet in respect of its physical state on drying out is a\r\nmatter of great practical concern to the agronomist. Some soils on\r\nbecoming dry fall into a pulverulent state and are easily brought into\r\nproper tilth; others become hard and tenacious, breaking into clods and\r\nresisting ordinary methods of pulverization. The physical laws which\r\ndetermine these conditions depend largely on the principles of\r\nflocculation soon to be described. The present task is to describe\r\nbriefly some of the methods of estimating the force of cohesion and\r\nadhesion.\r\n\r\n=119. General Method.=—The fine earth, air-dried, is mixed with enough\r\nwater to make a paste and molded into forms suitable for trial in a\r\nmachine for testing strength of cement, etc. The forms most used are\r\ncakes three to five centimeters in length and one to two centimeters\r\nthick. These are used for determining crushing power. For longitudinal\r\nadhesion the paste may be molded in prismatic or cylindrical shape.[78]\r\nThe prisms should show one to two centimeters in cross section or the\r\ncylinder be one to two centimeters in diameter. Before use they are to\r\nbe exposed for several days until thoroughly air-dried. The force\r\nrequired to separate or crush these prepared pieces will measure the\r\nadhesive or cohesive property of the sample. A great number of trials\r\nshould be made and the mean taken.\r\n\r\n=120. Method of Heinrich.=[79]—This process consists in mixing the\r\nair-dried earth with water until its aqueous content is fifty per cent\r\nof the highest water capacity determined by experiment. The sample is\r\nnext placed between two pieces of sheet iron of ten centimeters square,\r\neach of which in its middle point is provided with a hook. The thickness\r\nof the layer between the two pieces of iron should be about five to ten\r\ncentimeters. The exuding particles of soil are cut off with a knife. The\r\nupper piece of sheet iron is next suspended by a cord in such a way that\r\nthe iron piece occupies a horizontal position. A small basket is\r\nattached to the lower surface and sand added thereto, little by little,\r\nuntil the column of earth is separated. The sand basket and iron plate\r\nare weighed, and the total weight gives the power necessary to separate\r\na column of soil ten centimeters square in cross section. The iron\r\nplates may be roughened so that the adhesion thereto of the soil is\r\ngreater than its cohesive force.\r\n\r\n=121. Adhesion of Soil to Wood, Iron, Etc.=—The adhesive power of moist\r\nsoil for wood, iron, etc., is measured by Heinrich[80] in the following\r\nway: The soil is mixed with water, as above, until it contains just\r\nfifty per cent of its total water-holding content. It is then placed in\r\na large vessel and the upper surface made as smooth as possible. A plate\r\nof wood, iron, etc., of ten centimeters square is then pressed on the\r\nsurface until a complete contact is secured. This plate, by means of a\r\nhook and cord passing over a pulley, is then subjected to stress by\r\nweighting the cord which carries a basket for that purpose. The basket\r\nshould be of the same weight as the plate in contact with the soil. The\r\nweight added to the basket necessary to separate the plate from the soil\r\nis taken to represent the cohesive force. The author of the method\r\nappears to take no account of the pressure of the air on the plate\r\ncaused by the exclusion of the air from its under surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE ABSORPTIVE POWER OF SOILS FOR SALTS IN SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=122. General Principles.=[81]—It is a fact of every-day observation\r\nthat soils have a particular property of absorbing certain materials\r\nwith which they come in contact. If it were not for this property all\r\nour wells would soon become unwholesome from the reception of decayed\r\nanimal and vegetable matter carried to them in the drainage water from\r\nthe surface. It is also a well-known fact that burying dead bodies\r\nprevents the gaseous products of decomposition from reaching and\r\nvitiating the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBesides this well-known power of soils to absorb the decomposition\r\nproducts of animal and vegetable matter, they also possess a property\r\nwhich is of far greater importance in plant economy; that is, the power\r\nof withdrawing and retaining certain mineral constituents from their\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the sixteenth century mention is made by Lord Bacon of a\r\nprocess for obtaining pure water on the seashore by simply digging a\r\nhole in the sand and allowing it to fill with filtered sea water, which\r\nby this means is deprived of its salt. Although certain facts were\r\nobserved by some of the earlier writers in regard to soil absorption, no\r\nsystematic researches were conducted with a view of demonstrating the\r\nextent and cause of this power until within a comparatively few years.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Prof. Way published in the _Journal of the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety of England_, the results of a thorough and most excellent\r\ninvestigation of the subject. Since then many distinguished chemists,\r\nsuch as Henneberg, Stohmann, Peters, Heiden, Knop, Ullik, Pillitz,\r\nBiedermann, Tuxen, and others have given their attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n=123. Summary of Data.=—If a solution of a soluble sulfate, chloride or\r\nnitrate of an alkali or an alkaline-earth metal be placed in contact\r\nwith a soil, the result is that the soil takes up a part of the base but\r\nnone of the acid. This absorption of base is attended with the\r\nliberation of some other base from the soil which combines with the acid\r\nof the solution. Any alkali or alkaline earth base has the power of\r\nreplacing any other such base. However, if soluble phosphates and\r\nsilicates of these bases be placed in contact with the soil both the\r\nbase and the acid are removed from the solution.\r\n\r\nPeters[82] has shown that the amount of absorption depends upon the\r\nconcentration of the solution, the relation between the quantity of\r\nsolution and the soil and the kind of salt used. He treated 100 grams of\r\nearth with 250 cubic centimeters of solutions of different potash salts\r\nwith the following results:\r\n\r\n     Strength of solution.     ⅒ Normal.          ¹⁄₂₀ Normal.\r\n                                 Grams                Grams\r\n           Salt Used         K₂O absorbed.        K₂O absorbed.\r\n     KCl                         0.3124              0.1990\r\n     K₂SO₄                       0.3362              0.2098\r\n     K₂CO₃                       0.5747              0.3154\r\n\r\nBiedermann[83] proves that, for phosphoric acid at least, the absorption\r\nincreases with the temperature.\r\n\r\nIt has also been found that the amount of absorption depends upon the\r\ntime of contact between the soil and solution. Way found that the\r\nabsorption of ammonia was complete in half an hour, while Henneberg and\r\nStohmann[84] noticed that the phosphoric acid continued to be fixed\r\nafter the expiration of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIt is a very important fact that the absorption of a base is never\r\ncomplete; no matter how dilute the solution it will still carry a small\r\nportion of the base with it. Peters states that it requires about 28,000\r\nparts of water to remove one part of absorbed potash and Stohmann found\r\nthat it required about 10,000 parts of water to remove one part of\r\nabsorbed ammonia. With phosphoric acid, the resulting compound seems to\r\nbe much more insoluble.\r\n\r\nAccording to Tuxen[85] the presence of salts of soda and potash in\r\nsolution decreases the power of a soil to absorb ammonia compounds and\r\nthe presence of sodium salts decreases the power of a soil to absorb\r\npotash. On the other hand the presence of potassium compounds\r\nconsiderably increases the absorption of phosphoric acid. He further\r\naffirms that the compounds of potash, phosphoric acid, etc., formed in\r\nthe soil, are decidedly more soluble in sodium salts than in pure water.\r\n\r\n=124. Cause of Absorption.=—The withdrawing and fixing of phosphoric\r\nacid from solutions by the soil is not very difficult to understand as\r\nthis acid forms insoluble compounds of iron, lime, and magnesium, some\r\nor all of which are present in all soils. As to the absorption of the\r\nalkalies, the explanation is far more difficult as nearly all of their\r\nordinary compounds are readily soluble in water.\r\n\r\nAs lime is usually found combined with the acid part of an alkali salt,\r\nfrom which the base has been absorbed by the soil, it might naturally be\r\nsupposed that the absorptive power of the soil would depend upon the\r\namount of lime present. Way found, however, that the addition of chalk\r\nin no way influenced the absorption of ammonia by a soil which contained\r\nbut a small amount of lime. This fact was also confirmed by Knop[86] who\r\nfound that chalk exerted no influence on the absorption of ammonia\r\nsalts. These facts would seem to point to the conclusion that lime was\r\npresent in sufficient quantity in these experiments, or that it is not\r\nessential to the phenomena of absorption. However, as any alkali or\r\nalkaline-earth base can replace any other such base, the presence of\r\nlime in the filtrate is probably more of an accidental occurrence, owing\r\nto the comparatively large amount of that substance in most soils, than\r\na necessary condition, as any other base would doubtless answer in the\r\nabsence of lime.\r\n\r\n=125. Warington=[87] has shown that hydrated oxides of iron and\r\naluminum, and especially the former, are capable of absorbing potash and\r\nammonia, and as more or less of these hydrates exist in nearly all\r\nsoils, a part, at least, of absorptive phenomena is to be ascribed to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n=126. Way= tried to determine which of the constituents of a soil\r\nexercised chiefly the absorptive power. He passed a solution of ammonia\r\nthrough tubes containing pure sand and found that it came through\r\napparently unaltered from the first, while a soil treated in the same\r\nway removed the ammonia for a considerable time. He concluded from this\r\nthat the absorptive power does not exist in the sand. He next oxidized\r\nthe organic matter in a soil with nitric acid and then treated it with\r\nammonia in the same way. The first portions of the filtrate showed no\r\nammonia in any form, hence he concluded that organic matter is not\r\nessential to the act of absorption. He further showed that clay alone is\r\ncapable of causing absorption phenomena, by treating powdered clay\r\ntobacco pipes with ammonia.\r\n\r\nHaving shown that clay was the main constituent in a soil which caused\r\nthe absorption of alkalies, he tried next to trace out the particular\r\ncompound which caused the absorption. Having tried various natural\r\nsilicates he at last succeeded in producing a hydrated silicate of\r\naluminum and soda which exhibited displacement and absorptive properties\r\nvery similar to those shown by the soil.\r\n\r\nAs Way had succeeded in producing an artificial hydrated silicate\r\npossessing absorptive properties, Eichorn[88] thought of trying natural\r\nhydrated silicates or zeolites and found that they exhibited the same\r\npower as Way’s artificial preparation. It has also been shown by\r\nBiedermann,[89] Rautlenberg,[90] and Heiden[91] that the absorptive\r\npower bears a close relation to the amount of soluble silicates present.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts it is now generally accepted that the absorption\r\nof salts of the alkalies, accompanied by the change of base, is due\r\nchiefly to the presence of decomposed zeolite minerals in the soil.\r\n\r\nBesides the purely chemical absorption of salts by the soil, we have a\r\nphysical absorption of various substances similar to the action of\r\ncharcoal when used as a filter.\r\n\r\n=127. Conclusions of Armsby.=—The data connected with the absorption of\r\nbases by a soil have also been reviewed by Armsby.[92] He shows that the\r\nabsorption is accompanied by a chemical reaction between the salt whose\r\nbase is absorbed and some constituent of the soil, and this change seems\r\nto be due particularly to certain zeolitic silicates, although Liebig\r\nand others were disposed to credit this absorption largely to physical\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nKnop advances the idea that the soil has the power of disintegrating\r\nsalts in the presence of some substances like calcium carbonate which\r\ncan unite with the acid. In experiments made with hydrous silicates it\r\nwas shown that the absorption resembled in all cases like phenomena in\r\nthe soil; hence the supposition already advanced in regard to the\r\ninfluence of such silicates is doubtless true.\r\n\r\nIn respect of absorption in general, the following conclusions were\r\nreached:\r\n\r\n1. The absorption of combined bases by the soil consists in an exchange\r\nof bases between the salt and the hydrous silicates of the soil.\r\n\r\n2. This exchange, which is primarily chemical, is only partial, its\r\nextent varying\r\n\r\n(a) with the concentration of the solution, and\r\n\r\n(b) with the ratio between the volume of the solution and the quality of\r\nsoil used.\r\n\r\n3. The cause of these variations is probably the action of mass or the\r\ntendency of resulting compounds to re-form the original bodies, the\r\nabsorption actually found in any case marking the point where the two\r\nforces are in equilibrium.\r\n\r\n=128. Selective Absorption of Potash.=—As a rule more potash is absorbed\r\nfrom the sulfate than from the chlorid. This fact would seem to point to\r\nthe advisability of using sulfate as a fertilizer in preference to\r\nchlorid. However, as with the exception of nitrates, the absorptive\r\npower of a soil, for the salts used as fertilizers, is many times\r\ngreater than it is ever called upon to exert in fixing applied\r\nfertilizers, we need not trouble ourselves in regard to the absorption\r\nof phosphoric acid, potash or ammonia, in so far as the practical side\r\nof the matter is concerned. For example, an acre of soil to the depth of\r\nnine inches weighs about 900 tons. Now it has been found by Huston,[93]\r\nthat 100 parts of a soil experimented upon absorbed over 0.25 part of\r\nP₂O₅, hence 900 parts would absorb over 2.25 parts of P₂O₅; or an acre\r\nof this soil to the depth of nine inches would absorb over two and\r\none-fourth tons of phosphoric acid. 500 pounds per acre is a large\r\ndressing of a phosphatic fertilizer for field crops and 500 pounds of a\r\nhigh grade fertilizer would contain about 100 pounds of P₂O₅; hence the\r\npower of such a soil to absorb phosphoric acid is more than forty-five\r\ntimes as great as it is ever likely to be called upon to exert in fixing\r\nthe phosphoric acid added to it as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nHuston has further shown that an acre of soil nine inches deep will\r\nabsorb more than 2.7 tons of potash (K₂O) from potassium chlorid from\r\nwhich salt less potash is absorbed than from the sulfate. Now one-tenth\r\nton of potassium chlorid per acre would be a large dressing of potash,\r\nhence this soil possesses the power of absorbing more than twenty-seven\r\ntimes as much potash as is ever likely to be applied as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIn like manner it may be shown that the power of an acre of soil nine\r\ninches deep to absorb ammonia from ammonium sulfate is more than\r\nthirty-two times as great as it would be called upon to exert in fixing\r\nthe ammonia from a dressing of one-quarter ton of ammonium sulfate per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nWith sodium nitrate, however, there is no absorption; hence great care\r\nis necessary in the application of nitrogen as a nitrate, for, if it be\r\nput on in large quantities, at a season when the plant is not prepared\r\nto assimilate it, or during a period of heavy rains, there must\r\nunavoidably result loss from drainage. The best time to apply a nitrate\r\nis evidently during the active growing season.\r\n\r\n=129. Whitney=[94] places great emphasis on the surface area of soil\r\nparticles in respect to their power to absorb solutions of salts. The\r\napproximate surface area of a cubic foot of each of the different\r\ntypical soils of Maryland is as follows:\r\n\r\n                 Pine barrens       23,940 square feet.\r\n                 Truck lands        74,130   „      „\r\n                 Tobacco lands      84,850   „      „\r\n                 Wheat lands        94,540   „      „\r\n                 River terrace     106,260   „      „\r\n                 Limestone subsoil 202,600   „      „\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there are about 24,000 square feet of surface area\r\nin a cubic foot of the subsoil of the pine barrens, no less then 100,000\r\nsquare feet or two and three-tenths acres of surface area in a cubic\r\nfoot of the subsoil of the river terrace, and 200,000 square feet of\r\nsurface area in a cubic foot of the limestone subsoil.\r\n\r\nThese figures seem vast, but they are probably below rather than above\r\nthe true values, on account of the wide range of the diameters of the\r\nclay group. This great extent of surface and of surface attraction,\r\nwhich has been described as potential, gives the soil great power to\r\nabsorb moisture from the air, and to absorb and hold back mineral\r\nmatters from solution. A smooth surface of glass will attract and hold,\r\nby this surface attraction, an appreciable amount of moisture from the\r\nsurrounding air. A cubic foot of soil, having 100,000 square feet of\r\nsurface, should be able to attract and hold a considerably larger amount\r\nof moisture.\r\n\r\nIt might have been added that if the potential of the surface,\r\nseparating the solution from the soil, be greater than the potential in\r\nthe interior of the liquid mass, there will be a tendency to concentrate\r\nthe liquid on this surface of separation. It has been shown that certain\r\nfluids have greater density on a surface separating the fluid from a\r\nsolid. On the other hand, if the potential were low there might be no\r\ntendency for this concentration, and even the reverse conditions would\r\nprevail and the soluble substance could be readily washed out of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n=130. Removal of Organic Matters.=—It is probably largely due to this\r\nstraining power that organic matters are removed from solutions in\r\npercolating through the soil. Whitney[95] has observed that the organic\r\nmatter may be coagulated and precipitated from solution by the soil\r\nconstituents, and held in the soil in loose flocculent masses, while the\r\nliquid passes through nearly free of organic matter.\r\n\r\n=131. Importance of Soil Absorption.=—The importance of the absorptive\r\npower of the soil can hardly be overestimated. By means of this power\r\nthose mineral ingredients of plant food, of which most soils contain but\r\nlittle, are held too closely to allow of rapid loss by drainage, and\r\nstill sufficiently available to answer the needs of vegetation, provided\r\nthe store is large enough. The only important plant food liable to be\r\ndeficient in the soil which does not come under the influence of\r\nabsorption is nitrogen in the form of salts of nitric acid, and nature\r\nhas made a wide provision for this element by binding it in the form of\r\norganic bodies which nitrify but slowly, and by supplying each year a\r\nsmall quantity from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBy means of the absorptive power of soils the farmer, if he puts on an\r\nexcess of potash or phosphoric acid as a fertilizer, does not lose it\r\nbut is able to reap some benefits from it in the next and even in\r\nsucceeding crops. If it were not for this power the best method for\r\napplying fertilizers would be a much more complicated problem than it is\r\nat present; and it would be necessary to apply them at just the proper\r\nseason and in nicely regulated amounts to insure against loss.\r\n\r\n=132. Method of Determining Absorption of Chemical Salts.=—The soil\r\nwhich is to be used for this experiment should be treated as has been\r\nindicated and passed through a sieve the meshes of which do not exceed\r\nhalf a millimeter in size. From twenty-five to fifty grams of the fine\r\nearth may be used for each experiment.\r\n\r\nThe fine earth should be placed in a flask with 100 to 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the one-tenth to one-hundredth normal solution of the\r\nsubstance to be absorbed. The flask should be well shaken and allowed to\r\nstand with frequent shaking twenty-four to forty-eight hours at ordinary\r\ntemperatures. The whole is then to be thrown upon a folded filter and an\r\naliquot part of the filtrate taken for the estimation. The methods of\r\ndetermining the quantities of the substances used will be found in other\r\nparts of this manual. It is recommended to conduct a blank experiment\r\nwith water under the same conditions in order to determine the amount of\r\nthe material under consideration abstracted from the soil by the water\r\nalone. The difference in the strength of the solution as filtered from\r\nthe soil, corrected by the amount indicated by the blank experiment, and\r\nthe original solution will give the absorptive power of the soil for the\r\nparticular substance under consideration.\r\n\r\nIf it should be desired to determine the absorptive power of the soil\r\nfor all the ordinary chemical fertilizing materials at the same time, a\r\nlarger quantity of the sample should be taken corresponding to the\r\nincreased amount of the standard solutions used. About 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the mixed salt solution should be shaken with 125 grams\r\nof the earth and the process carried on in general as indicated above.\r\nThe absorption coefficient of an earth for any given salt according to\r\nFesca,[96] is the quantity of the absorbed material expressed in\r\nmilligrams calculated to a unit of 100 grams of the soil.\r\n\r\n=133. Method of Pillitz and Zalomanoff.=—It is recommended by Pillitz\r\nand Zalomanoff[25] to reject the old method, _viz._, shaking the soil\r\nwith the solution in a flask, and substitute the filtration method both\r\nbecause it gives a more natural process and because the results are more\r\nconstant. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 15.\r\n\r\n  ZALOMANOFF’S APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING ABSORPTION OF SALTS BY SOILS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTwo cylinders are placed vertically, one over the other. The lower\r\ncylinder is graduated in cubic centimeters, the upper cylinder is closed\r\nat each end by perforated rubber stoppers A and B through the openings\r\nof which the glass tubes _c_ and _d_ pass. Within the cylinder A the\r\nopening of the small tube _d_ is closed with a disk of Swedish filter\r\npaper. The lower part of the small tube is _d_ connected by means of a\r\nrubber tube carrying a pinch-cock C, with another small tube _e_ which\r\npasses through the stopper _f_. In carrying out the process the weighed\r\nquantity of soil is placed in the upper cylinder and afterwards the\r\nmeasured quantity of the solution, the whole thoroughly mixed and the\r\ncylinder closed. The valve C is then opened, a given quantity of the\r\nsolution, but not all, is made to drop into the lower cylinder and the\r\nvalve C is then closed. The liquid which has passed into the lower\r\ncylinder as well as that which remains in the upper cylinder, is\r\nthoroughly stirred and the quantity of the material remaining in both\r\nliquids determined and the absorbing power of the soil estimated from\r\ntheir difference. It does not appear that this method of estimation of\r\nthe absorption power possesses any special advantages over the old and\r\nfar simpler method of shaking in a flask.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 16.\r\n\r\n  MÜLLER’S APPARATUS TO SHOW ABSORPTION OF SALTS BY SOILS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=134. Method of Müller.=—The method of Müller[97] for illustrating\r\nabsorption is carried out by means of the apparatus shown in Fig. 16. A\r\nglass cylinder A about 750 centimeters long and four to five centimeters\r\nwide is closed at each end with rubber stoppers with a single\r\nperforation. The cylinder A is for the reception of the soil with which\r\nthe experiment is to be made. Before using, the lower part of it is\r\nfilled with glass pearls or broken glass and above this a layer of glass\r\nwool is placed about one centimeter thick. The object of this is to\r\nprevent the soil from passing into the small tube below. As soon as the\r\nsoil has all been placed in the cylinder A the upper part of the tube is\r\nalso filled with glass wool. The cylinder A is connected with the\r\npressure bottle B by means of a rubber tube and the small glass bulb\r\ntube shown in the figure. The bottle B should have a content of about\r\ntwo liters. It is filled with the standard solution of the material of\r\nwhich the absorption coefficient is to be determined. At _c_ the rubber\r\ntube is connected with a glass T one arm of which is provided with a\r\npiece of rubber tubing which can be closed by means of a pinch-cock. At\r\n_c_ a screw pinch-cock is placed which can be used to regulate the flow\r\nof the solution from B to A. By opening the pinch-cock at _e_ on the\r\nshort arm of the T piece, a sample of the original liquid can be taken\r\nand this can be compared with the part which runs to _b_. If it is\r\ndesired for instance, to show that potassium carbonate has been absorbed\r\nby the soil the two bulbs shown on the small glass tubes connecting with\r\nA can be filled with red litmus paper. This paper will at once be turned\r\nblue in the lower bulb while in the upper one it will retain its\r\noriginal color because the liquid in passing through the soil will have\r\nlost its alkaline reaction. The solutions used should be very dilute.\r\nThe apparatus is designed for lecture experiments and not for\r\nquantitative determinations.\r\n\r\n=135. Method of Knop.=—For rapid determination of the absorption\r\ncoefficient of the soil Knop’s method may be used.[98]\r\n\r\nThe fine earth which is employed is that which passes a sieve with\r\nmeshes of half a millimeter. From 50 to 100 grams of this soil are mixed\r\nwith from five to ten grams of powdered chalk and with about twice the\r\nweight of ammonium chlorid solution of known strength, _viz._, from 100\r\nto 200 cubic centimeters. The ammonia solution should be of such a\r\nconcentration that the ammonia by its decomposition for each cubic\r\ncentimeter of the liquid evolves exactly one cubic centimeter of\r\nnitrogen. This solution is prepared by dissolving in 208 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water one gram of ammonium chlorid. With frequent shaking\r\nthe solution is allowed to stand in contact with the soil for\r\nforty-eight hours. The whole is now allowed to settle and the\r\nsupernatant clear liquid is poured through a dry filter. From the\r\nfiltrate twenty to forty cubic centimeters are removed by a pipette, and\r\nevaporated to dryness in a small porcelain dish, with the addition of a\r\ndrop of pure hydrochloric acid. The ammonium chlorid remaining in the\r\nporcelain dish is washed with ten cubic centimeters of water into one of\r\nthe compartments of the evolution flask of the Knop-Wagner azotometer.\r\nIt is decomposed with fifty cubic centimeters of bromin lye and the\r\nnitrogen estimated volumetrically. The difference between the amount of\r\nnitrogen in this material and that of the original material will give\r\nthe amount of absorption exercised by the fine earth. This number,\r\nwithout any further calculation, can be taken as the coefficient of\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\n=136. Method of Huston.=—The salt solutions recommended by Huston[99]\r\nare sodium phosphate (Na₂HPO₄), potassium chlorid, potassium sulfate,\r\nammonium sulfate and sodium nitrate.\r\n\r\nThe solutions should be approximately tenth normal, the actual strength\r\nin each case being determined by analysis. The phosphorus is determined\r\nas magnesium pyrophosphate in the usual way, the potash as potassium\r\nplatinochlorid, the ammonia by collecting the distillate from soda in\r\nhalf normal hydrochloric acid and titrating with standard alkali, and\r\nthe nitrate by Warington’s modification of Schlösing’s method for gas\r\nanalysis. The details of these methods of determination will be given\r\nlater. One hundred grams of the sifted, air-dried soil are placed in a\r\nrubber stopped bottle and treated with 250 cubic centimeters of the\r\nsolution to be tested. The digestion is continued for forty-eight hours\r\nin each case, the bottles being thoroughly shaken at the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours. At the end of the treatment the solutions are\r\nfiltered and the salts determined in aliquot portions. The details of\r\nthis method are essentially those already described.\r\n\r\n=137.

Whether this fact is merely an\r\naccidental occurrence or is due to the law of combination by equivalents\r\ncould hardly be predicted from the single soil experimented upon; but\r\ntaking into consideration the possibility of difference in solubility of\r\nthe resulting compounds in the saline solutions used, and of other\r\nvarying conditions, the percentages are evidently not far enough apart\r\nto exclude the possibility of the bases uniting in equivalent\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n=138. Preparation of Salts for Absorption.=—The salts employed in the\r\nforegoing determinations are conveniently prepared, in fractional normal\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIn grams per liter the following quantities in grams are recommended,\r\n_viz._, 5.35 g NH₄Cl; 10.11 g KNO₃; 16.40 g Ca(NO₃)₂; 24.60 g MgSO₄ +\r\n7H₂O; 23.4 g CaH₄(PO₄)₂, etc.\r\n\r\nThe ammonium chlorid, potassium nitrate and magnesium sulfate can be\r\nweighed as chemically pure salts and the standard solution be directly\r\nmade up. Calcium nitrate is so hygroscopic that a stronger solution must\r\nbe made up, the calcium determined and the proper volume taken and\r\ndiluted to one liter.\r\n\r\nMonocalcium phosphate is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nA solution of sodium phosphate is treated with glacial acetic acid and\r\nprecipitated with a solution of calcium chlorid. It is then washed with\r\nwater until all chlorin is removed. The fresh precipitate is saturated\r\nwith pure, cold phosphoric acid of known strength. After filtering the\r\nsolution is placed in a warm room and left for two or three weeks until\r\ncrystallization takes place.\r\n\r\nThe crystals are pressed between blotting papers and finally dried over\r\nsulfuric acid and washed with water-free ether, and again dried. Since\r\nthis salt is decomposed in strong solutions it should be used only in\r\none hundredth normal strength, viz., 2.34 grams per liter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                POROSITY AND ITS RELATIONS TO MOISTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=139. Porosity.=—The porosity of a soil depends upon the state of\r\ndivisibility and arrangement of its particles, and upon the amount of\r\ninterstitial space within the soil. If a soil be cemented together into\r\na homogeneous mass, its porosity sinks to a minimum; if it be composed,\r\nhowever, of numerous fine particles, each preserving its own physical\r\ncondition, the porosity of the soil will rise to a maximum. The porosity\r\nof a soil may be judged very closely by the percentage of fine particles\r\nit yields by the process of silt analysis to be described further on. In\r\ngeneral, the more finely divided the particles of a soil, the greater\r\nits fertility. This arises from various causes; in the first place, such\r\na soil has a high capacity for absorbing moisture and holding it; thus\r\nthe dangers of excessive rain-falls are diminished, and the evil effects\r\nof prolonged drought mitigated. In the second place, a porous soil\r\npermits a freer circulation of the gases found in the soil. The\r\ninfluence of lime in securing the proper degree of porosity of a soil is\r\nvery great, especially in alluvial deposits and other stiff soils. It\r\nprevents the impaction which will necessarily follow in a soil which is\r\ntoo finely divided. In general, the porosity of the soil may be said to\r\ndepend on three factors, _viz._: 1. Upon the state of divisibility or\r\nthe number of particles per unit volume; 2. Upon the nature and\r\narrangement of these particles; 3. Upon how much interstitial space\r\nthere is in the soil.\r\n\r\n=140. Influence of Drainage.=—Good underdrainage increases the porosity\r\nof a soil by removing the excess of water during wet seasons and\r\nrendering the soil more suitable to capillary attraction which will\r\nsupply moisture during dry seasons. The influence of tile drainage on\r\nthe production of floods has been carefully studied by Kedzie,[100] who\r\nshows that surface ditching in conjunction with deforesting may increase\r\nfloods and contribute to droughts, and that tile-draining may increase\r\nflood at the break-up in spring, when the water accumulated in the\r\nsurface soil by the joint action of frost and soil capillarity during\r\nthe winter, and the surface accumulations in the form of snow are\r\nsuddenly set free by a rapid thaw.\r\n\r\nHe also points out that during the warm months tile-draining tends to\r\nprevent flood by enabling the soil to take up the excessive rain-fall\r\nand hold it in capillary form, keeping back the sudden flow that would\r\npass over the surface of the soil if not absorbed by it, and it\r\nmitigates summer drought by increased capacity of the soil to hold water\r\nin capillary form and to draw upon the subsoil water supply.\r\n\r\n=141. Soil Moisture.=—The capacity of a soil to absorb moisture and\r\nretain it depends on its porosity and is an important characteristic in\r\nrelation to its agricultural value.\r\n\r\nThe following general principles relating to soil moisture are adapted\r\nfrom Stockbridge:[101]\r\n\r\nDuring dry weather plants require a soil which is absorptive and\r\nretentive of atmospheric moisture. The amount of this retention is\r\ngenerally in direct ratio to two factors, _viz._, the amount of organic\r\nmatter and its state of division. The capillary water of the soil is\r\nvery closely related to its percolating power, since all waters in the\r\nsoil are governed in their movements by what is known as capillary\r\nforce. Liebenberg has shown that this movement may be either upwards or\r\ndownwards, according as the atmosphere is dry or supplies\r\nsoil-saturating rain. The water absorbed by the roots passes into the\r\nplant circulation, and the greater part is evaporated from the leaves.\r\nWhere the supply of water is insufficient, the plant wilts, and if the\r\nevaporation long continue in excess of the supply obtained from the\r\nsoil, the plant must die. The experiments of Hellriegel have shown that\r\nany soil can supply plants with all the water they need, and as fast as\r\nthey need it, so long as the moisture within the soil is not reduced\r\nbelow one-third of the whole amount that it can hold. The quantity of\r\nwater required and evaporated by different agricultural plants during\r\nthe period of growth has been found to be as follows:\r\n\r\n      One acre of wheat       exhales    409,832 pounds of water.\r\n       „   „   „  clover         „     1,096,234   „    „    „\r\n       „   „   „  sunflowers     „    12,585,994   „    „    „\r\n       „   „   „  cabbage        „     5,049,194   „    „    „\r\n       „   „   „  grape-vines    „       730,733   „    „    „\r\n       „   „   „  hops           „     4,445,021   „    „    „\r\n\r\nDietrich estimates the amount of water exhaled by the foliage of plants\r\nto be from 250 to 400 times the weight of dry organic matter formed\r\nduring the same time. Cultivation conserves soil moisture. It must be\r\nremembered that this water contains soil ingredients in solution.\r\nHoffmann has estimated that the quantity of matter dissolved from the\r\nsoil by water varies from 0.242 to 0.0205 per cent of the dried earth.\r\nThe experiments of Humphrey and Abbott have shown that about one-sixth\r\nof the total sediment of the Mississippi river is soluble in water.\r\n\r\n=142. Determination of the Porosity of the Soil.=—The porosity of the\r\nsoil is fixed by the relative volume of the solid particles as compared\r\nwith the interstitial space. It is most easily determined by dividing\r\nthe apparent by the real specific gravity.\r\n\r\nLet the real specific gravity of a soil be 2.5445 and the apparent\r\nspecific gravity of the same soil be 1.0990.\r\n\r\nThe porosity is then calculated according to the following ratios,\r\n_viz._:\r\n\r\n                        2.5445 : 1.099 = 100 : X\r\n\r\nWhence X = 43.2 = per cent volume occupied by the solid particles of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe per cent volume occupied by the interstitial space is therefore\r\n56.8.\r\n\r\n=143. Method of Whitney.=—The total volume of interstitial space within\r\nthe soil, in which water and air can enter, is best determined by\r\ncalculation from the specific gravity and the weight of a known volume\r\nof soil. To determine this in the soil in its natural position in the\r\nfield, a sample is taken in the following way: A brass tube, about two\r\ninches in diameter and nine inches long, has a clock spring securely\r\nsoldered into one end, and this end turned off in a lathe to give a good\r\ncutting edge of steel. The area enclosed by this steel edge is\r\naccurately determined, and a mark is placed on the side of the tube\r\nexactly six inches from the cutting edge. A steel cap fits on top of the\r\nbrass cylinder to receive the blows of a heavy hammer or wooden mallet.\r\nThe cylinder is driven into the ground until the six-inch mark is just\r\nlevel with the surface. The whole is then dug out, care being taken to\r\nslip a broad piece of steel under the cylinder before it is removed, so\r\nas to prevent the soil which it contains from falling out. The cylinder\r\nis then carefully laid over on its side, and the soil is cut off flush\r\nwith the cutting edge of steel. The soil is then removed from the\r\ncylinder, carried to the laboratory and properly dried and weighed. The\r\nobject of the steel inserted in one end of the cylinder is to reduce the\r\nfriction on the inside of the tube to a minimum, and thus prevent the\r\nsoil inside the cylinder being forced down below the level of the\r\nsurrounding earth. The volume of the soil removed with this sampler can\r\nreadily be determined by calculation, as the area of the end of the tube\r\nis known and the sample is six inches deep. In a sampler, such as\r\ndescribed here, this volume is about 300 cubic centimeters. From the\r\nweight of soil and the volume of the sample, the volume of interstitial\r\nspace may be found by the following formula:\r\n\r\n                        S = ([V − W/ω] × 100)/V\r\n\r\nS is the per cent by volume of interstitial space, V is the volume of\r\nthe tube in cubic centimeters, W is the weight of soil in grams, and ω\r\nis the specific gravity of the soil. The specific gravity can be\r\ndetermined for each soil, or the factor 2.65 can be used, which is\r\nsufficiently accurate for most work.\r\n\r\nThe per cent by volume of interstitial space in the undisturbed subsoil\r\nis found to range from about thirty-five for sandy land, to sixty-five\r\nor seventy for stiff clay lands.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of the amount of water an air-dried soil will\r\nhold, if all the space within it is completely filled with water, an\r\neight-inch straight argand lamp chimney, with a diameter of about two\r\ninches, can be conveniently used. A mark is placed on the side of the\r\ntube, six inches from one end, and the volume of the tube up to this\r\nmark is found by covering the end with a piece of thin rubber cloth, or\r\nby pressing the chimney down firmly on a glass plate, and making a\r\nwater-tight joint with paraffin or wax. Water is then poured into the\r\ntube up to the six-inch mark, and the weight or volume of water\r\ndetermined. The tube can then be dried, a piece of muslin tied tightly\r\nover the top and the whole then weighed. Soil is carefully poured in and\r\nthe tube gently tapped on a soft support until the soil is six inches\r\ndeep in the tube, and has the desired degree of compactness. The weight\r\nand volume of the soil can thus be determined, and the volume of the\r\ninterstitial space from the formula already given. This can also be\r\ndetermined directly by introducing water from above, or by immersing the\r\ncylinder of soil up to the six-inch mark in water, and allowing the\r\nwater to enter the soil from below. With such a short depth of soil,\r\nvery little water will flow out when the cylinder is suspended in the\r\nair. The amount which will flow out when the cylinder is thus suspended,\r\nwill depend both upon the texture and the depth of soil. It is\r\nimpossible, however, by this method, to completely remove the air or to\r\ncompletely fill the space within the soil with water; for as the water\r\nenters the soil, a considerable amount of air becomes entangled in the\r\ncapillary spaces, and this could not be removed except by boiling and\r\nvigorous stirring, which would altogether change the texture of the\r\nsoil. The amount of water held by the soil, or the amount of space\r\nwithin the soil into which water and air can enter, will evidently\r\ndepend upon the compactness of the soil, and this is best expressed in\r\nper cent by volume of space.\r\n\r\n=144. Capacity of the Fine Soil for Holding Moisture.=—The soil, as it\r\nis taken from the field, may have quite a different water coefficient\r\nfrom the same soil after it has been passed through a fine sieve or been\r\ndried at air temperatures or at 100° or 110°. The method of\r\ndetermination which depends upon adding excess of water to a given\r\nweight of fine earth, and afterwards eliminating the excess by\r\npercolation or filtration, is apt to give misleading results. If,\r\nhowever, the results are obtained by working on the same weight of soil,\r\nand in the same conditions, they may have value in a comparative way.\r\nThe comparison between soils must be made with equal weights, in like\r\napparatus and with the same manipulation, to have any value. These\r\ndeterminations, however, cannot have the same practical value as those\r\nmade in the samples in a natural condition as has just been described.\r\n\r\n=145. Method of Wolff Modified by Wahnschaffe.=[102]—A cylindrical zinc\r\ntube (Fig. 17), sixteen centimeters long and four centimeters internal\r\ndiameter, is used, the cubical capacity of which is 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is graduated by placing the moist linen disk on the gauze\r\nand tying a piece of rubber cloth over the bottom. Water is now poured\r\nin until the level is even with the gauze bottom. Add then exactly 200\r\ncubic centimeters of water, mark its surface on the zinc, throw out the\r\nwater, and file the zinc down to the mark.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the tube is closed with a fine nickel-wire gauze. Below\r\nthis a piece of zinc tubing, of the size of the main tube, is soldered;\r\npierced laterally with a number of holes.\r\n\r\nBefore using, the gauze bottom of the cylinder is covered with a moist,\r\nclose fitting linen disk, and the whole apparatus weighed. It is then\r\nfilled with the fine earth, little by little, jolting the cylinder on a\r\nsoft substance after each addition of soil to secure an even filling.\r\nWhen filled even full the whole is weighed, the increase in weight\r\ngiving the weight of soil taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 17.\r\n\r\n  CAPACITY OF THE FINE SOIL FOR HOLDING MOISTURE. METHOD OF WOLFF\r\n    MODIFIED BY WAHNSCHAFFE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA large number of cylinders can be filled at once and placed in a large\r\nglass crystallizing dish containing water and covered with a bell jar\r\n(Fig. 17). The water should cover the gauze bottoms of the cylinders to\r\nthe depth of five to ten millimeters. More water should be added from\r\ntime to time as absorption takes place. The cylinders should be left in\r\nthe water until when weighed at intervals of an hour no appreciable\r\nincrease in weight takes place. The temperature and barometer reading\r\nshould be noted in connection with each determination. With increasing\r\ntemperature the water coefficient is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe method of Wolff, as practiced in the laboratory of the Chemical\r\nDivision of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, has given very\r\nconcordant results.

The cylindrical soil column was divided into four\r\nequal parts and the moisture determined in each part. Beginning with the\r\ntop quarter the percentages of moisture were as follows:\r\n\r\n                     First  quarter  97.52 per cent\r\n                     Second    „    105.91  „   „\r\n                     Third     „    112.83  „   „\r\n                     Fourth    „    116.48  „   „\r\n\r\n=146. Method of Petermann.=[103]—The method of Wolff as practiced by the\r\nBelgian Experiment Station, at Gembloux, is essentially the same as\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\nPetermann recommends the use of tared cylinders twenty to twenty-five\r\ncentimeters long and six to eight centimeters in diameter. The cylinder\r\nis to be filled with the fine earth, little by little, with gentle\r\ntapping after each addition. The bottom of the cylinder is closed with a\r\nperforated rubber stopper on which is spread a moistened disk of linen.\r\nThe cylinder, thus prepared and filled, is weighed and afterwards placed\r\nin a vessel containing distilled water, to such a depth as to secure a\r\nwater level about two centimeters above the lower surface of the soil in\r\nthe cylinder. The level of the water is kept constant as the contents of\r\nthe cylinder are moistened by capillarity. When the earth appears to be\r\nthoroughly moistened, as can be told by the appearance of the upper\r\nsurface, maintain the contact with water for about five or six hours.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is then removed, the upper surface covered to avoid\r\nevaporation, allowed to drain for a few hours, wiped and weighed. The\r\ncylinder is again placed in water to see if any increase in weight takes\r\nplace. The weight of the fine earth and of the absorbed water being\r\nknown, the percentage of absorption is easily calculated.\r\n\r\n=147. Method of A. Mayer.=[104]—A glass tube, one and seven-tenths\r\ncentimeters in diameter, composed of two pieces, seventy-five\r\ncentimeters and twenty-five centimeters in length, is united by a piece\r\nof rubber tubing. The lower free end of the seventy-five centimeter\r\npiece is closed with a piece of linen. The tube is filled, with gentle\r\njolting, to the depth of one meter with fine earth, the earth column\r\nthus extending twenty-five centimeters above the point of union of the\r\ntwo pieces. Thus prepared, a quantity of water is poured into the upper\r\ntube sufficient to temporarily saturate the whole of the soil.\r\n\r\nDuring the sinking of the water in the tube there is thus effected a\r\nmoistening of the material before it is wholly filled with water. After\r\nwaiting until the water poured on top has disappeared the tube is\r\nseparated at the rubber tube connection and a sample of the moist soil\r\ntaken at that point. This is at once weighed and then dried at 100°. The\r\nloss in weight gives the water absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe number thus obtained is calculated to the standard by volume, by use\r\nof the number representing the apparent specific gravity of the fine\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nFor sand of different degrees of fineness the following numbers were\r\nfound:\r\n\r\n                 Degree of fineness       2   3    4\r\n                 Per cent water absorbed 7.0 13.7 44.6\r\n\r\nThe numbers thus obtained are taken to represent the absolute water\r\ncapacity of a mineral substance in powder.\r\n\r\nThe full water capacity, _i. e._, the power of holding water when the\r\npowder is immersed in water, the excess of which is then allowed to flow\r\naway is much greater than the absolute number.\r\n\r\nThis difference is shown in the following data:\r\n\r\n                            Quartz, size three.  Clay, size three.\r\n    Full water capacity           49.0 per cent       46.8 per cent\r\n    Absolute water capacity       13.7  „   „         24.5  „   „\r\n\r\nIn general the absolute is markedly inferior to the full water capacity.\r\nOnly in the finest dust do the two numbers approach each other.\r\n\r\n=148. Volumetric Determination.=—A convenient apparatus for this\r\ndetermination has been devised by Mr. J. L. Fuelling, of the Chemical\r\nDivision, Department of Agriculture. It is shown in Fig. 18.\r\n\r\nIt consists of an ordinary percolator the diameter of which decreases\r\nslightly towards the lower end, a thick-wall rubber tube and an ordinary\r\nburette, divided in tenths. A rubber stopper is fitted to the mouth of\r\nthe percolator and perforated twice—in the middle and at the side, the\r\nformer for a small tube provided with pinch-cock and the latter for the\r\nneck of a small funnel. The whole is supported on a convenient stand,\r\nthe clamp holding the percolator being placed above that supporting the\r\nburette, both clamps arranged to slide on the stand-rod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 18.\r\n\r\n  FUELLING’S APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe method is as follows:\r\n\r\nA mark is placed upon the projecting tube at the lower end of the\r\npercolator, and the tube at this point may be drawn out sufficiently to\r\ndecrease the width of meniscus to one-eighth inch. Into the percolator\r\nis first introduced a small disk of wire gauze or perforated porcelain,\r\nwith heavy wire pendant in the tube. Through the rubber stopper a small\r\nglass tube is passed and its lower end pressed firmly upon the wire or\r\nporcelain disk, its upper end being curved and supplied with a\r\npinch-cock. Into the percolator is now poured one inch of fine shot (No.\r\n20) and then one inch of fine sand which has been previously digested\r\nwith hydrochloric acid and well cleaned of dust by washing.\r\n\r\n_The zero._—After the shot and sand have been shaken even, the burette\r\nis filled with water and raised above the level of the sand, wetting the\r\npercolator for four inches of its length. The burette is lowered and the\r\nshot and sand bed allowed to drain by opening the pinch-cock of the\r\ninner tube. The burette is raised and the shot-sand flooded repeatedly\r\nuntil, by lowering the burette until the zero mark of the percolator\r\ntube is reached, a uniform reading on the burette is secured. Thus the\r\nshot-sand bed is completely charged with water. The water level is now\r\nmade zero on the percolator stem, the burette filled to its zero mark\r\nand the apparatus is prepared for introduction of the soil.\r\n\r\n_The Determination._—From 100 to 200 grams of soil, previously dried\r\nfree of moisture, are weighed, the burette raised until the water level\r\nis three inches above the sand, and the soil gently dropped through a\r\nfunnel into the water. When the soil has been introduced and wetted\r\ncompletely the water level is raised above the soil and allowed to\r\nremain thus two hours. The burette is then lowered and the water allowed\r\nto drain from the wetted soil. Four to six hours are usually given the\r\ndraining, the reading taken on the burette after establishing the zero\r\non the percolator stem, the volume of absorbed water thus ascertained\r\nand divided by the weight of soil multiplied by 100; the result\r\nexpresses the water absorbed per hundred of soil.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n Water required to saturate disk, etc.           0.50 cubic centimeter.\r\n Weight of air-dried soil taken                 20.00 grams.\r\n Moisture at 105° therein                       14.25 per cent.\r\n Weight water in soil                            2.85 grams.\r\n Reading of burette after saturation            10.75 cubic centimeters.\r\n Less water required for disk, etc               9.25     „        „\r\n Temperature                                   20°.00\r\n Weight of 9.25 cubic centimeters H₂O at 20°     9.22 grams.\r\n Total weight of water retained by soil         12.07         „\r\n Per cent water retained by soil                60.35 per cent.\r\n\r\nFor general analytical work the correction for variations in the weight\r\nof water for different temperatures is of no practical importance.\r\n\r\n=149. Accuracy of Results.=—A sample of soil from the beet sugar\r\nstation, in Nebraska, gave the following duplicate results:\r\n\r\n                   First trial  45.75 per cent water.\r\n                   Second trial 44.85  „   „     „\r\n\r\nMuck soils from Florida, containing varying proportions of sand, gave\r\nthe following numbers:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Soil number one, 144.85 per cent, and 145.43 per cent; soil number\r\n  two, 109.13 per cent, and 107.93 per cent; soil number three (very\r\n  sandy), 46.86 per cent, and 46.51 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=150. Method of Wollny.=[105]—A zinc tube, ninety centimeters long and\r\nfour centimeters internal diameter, carries at each end, at right angles\r\nto the axis, a flattened rim 1.5 centimeters broad. The lower end of the\r\ntube is closed with a strong piece of coarse linen. The soil to be\r\nexamined is then filled in little by little, with gentle tamping.\r\n\r\nOn the upper end two glass tubes are placed, each ten centimeters long\r\nand four centimeters internal diameter. These tubes are furnished at\r\neach end with cemented brass cylinders which are expanded to a circular,\r\nevenly ground rim, 1.5 centimeters wide, also at right angles to the\r\naxis of the main tube. These rims are greased and placed together, one\r\non the other, and held together by wooden clamps.\r\n\r\nThe glass tube in immediate connection with the zinc tube is also firmly\r\nfilled with the soil sample, while the second tube is only partly\r\nfilled, so that any settling which may take place in the soil on the\r\naddition of water may still find the first glass tube full of the\r\nsample.\r\n\r\nThe empty part of the upper glass tube is now filled with water and\r\nadditional quantities of water are added from time to time until the\r\nsoil is saturated. In order to be able to observe when this takes place\r\nthere is a slit at the lower end of the zinc tube which is closed with a\r\npiece of glass. This slit should be about two centimeters broad and ten\r\ncentimeters long. The lower end of the zinc tube is set on a glass plate\r\nto prevent evaporation.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the water shows itself at the lower end of the zinc tube, the\r\nexcess of water in the upper glass tube is at once removed by a pipette\r\nand a stopper inserted through which a glass tube passes drawn out into\r\na fine point above. The object of this is to avoid evaporation on the\r\nupper surface. The apparatus is then left at rest for thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this time the clamps are removed and the column of moist\r\nearth cut with a piece of platinum foil, and the two ends of the glass\r\ntube, next to the zinc tube, covered with glass plates. It is then\r\nweighed and the weight of moist earth determined by deducting the weight\r\nof the tube and its glass covers. The moist earth is carefully removed\r\nto a large porcelain dish and dried at 100°. Before weighing it is\r\nallowed to stand twenty-four hours in the air. The data obtained are\r\nused to calculate the water content to volume per cent.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the glass tubes should be determined by careful\r\ncalibration.\r\n\r\n=151. Method of Heinrich.=[106]—The soil to the depth turned by the plow\r\nis dug out and in the hole a lead vessel without bottom, twenty\r\ncentimeters in diameter and forty centimeters high, is placed. The soil\r\nis then thrown back around and outside the lead vessel until the latter\r\nappears buried in the fragments.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the soil is passed into the lead vessel, through a sieve\r\nhaving four meshes to the centimeter, using for this purpose enough\r\nwater to thoroughly moisten it. Care should be taken not to use enough\r\nwater to cause any separation of the fine from the coarse particles.\r\n\r\nBy this process all coarse stones, sticks, etc., are separated. In sandy\r\nsoils the flask is left for a few hours while in clay soils a much\r\nlonger time is necessary. When the excess of water has disappeared the\r\nlead cylinder is removed, and a piece cut out of the center of it placed\r\nin a weighed drying flask and dried at 100°.\r\n\r\n=152. Effect of Pressure on Water Capacity.=[107]—The increasing\r\ncapacity of soil to hold water developed by shaking or pressure, is\r\ndetermined by Henrici in the following way:\r\n\r\nInto a glass cylinder of twenty millimeters internal diameter are poured\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of water. A given quantity of soil is next\r\nadded, and after standing until thoroughly saturated, the residual water\r\nis measured by pouring off, or better, by graduations on the side of the\r\ntube. The increase in the volume of the clear water is also measured,\r\nafter shaking, in the same way. The data of a determination made as\r\nabove described follow:\r\n\r\n       Water in cylinder                    30 cubic centimeters.\r\n       Water and saturated soil             40   „        „\r\n       Volume of unsaturated soil = e =     10   „        „\r\n       Volume of saturated soil = e + w = 20.5   „        „\r\n       Water contained therein = w =      10.5   „        „\r\n\r\nBy repeated shaking the volume of e + w, the content of w therein, and\r\nthe relative values of e/w were found to be as follows:\r\n\r\n                Cubic        Cubic        Cubic        Cubic\r\n             centimeters. centimeters. centimeters. centimeters.\r\n       e + w         20.5         16.0         15.7         15.0\r\n           w         10.5          6.0          5.7          5.0\r\n       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n         w/e         1.05         0.60         0.57         0.50\r\n\r\nIf e′ represent the volume of the saturated soil then e′ = e + w, and\r\nthis gives the relation to the volume of dry earth represented by the\r\nequation e′/e = 1 + w/e. This indicates that the relative volume of the\r\nsaturated soil is equal to unity increased by the relative content of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n=153. Coefficient of Evaporation.=—At an ordinary room temperature in\r\nthe shade, samples of soil, if they are subjected to experiment in\r\ntolerably thin layers have nearly an equal coefficient of evaporation.\r\nThat is, the absolute quantity of water evaporated in a given time is\r\nalmost entirely conditioned upon the magnitude of the surface exposed\r\nand the temperature of the surrounding air. Only when exposed in\r\nconditions as nearly as possible natural in thin layers to the action of\r\nthe sunlight and shade do the soils show their peculiarities in respect\r\nof the evaporation of moisture. In order to see these peculiarities,\r\nsamples of soil which have been previously examined must be subjected to\r\nexamination at the same time with the soil whose properties are to be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe zinc box, before described, should be protected with a well fitting\r\ncover of thick paper, and the different samples of soil which are to be\r\ntested placed therein. This should now be placed in a wooden box, the\r\ntop of which is exactly even with the top of the zinc vessel. This box\r\ncontaining the vessel should be exposed to the sunlight. After\r\ntwenty-four hours the zinc boxes can be taken away from position and\r\ntheir loss in moisture determined, and these weighings, according to the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere, can be continued from fourteen days to\r\nthree weeks, the temperature of the air of course being carefully\r\ndetermined at each time. At first, all the different soils being\r\nsaturated with moisture, it will be observed that the loss of moisture\r\nis proportionately the same for all. Soon, however, the rapidity of the\r\nevaporation in the samples of soil rich in humus and clay will be\r\ndecreased as compared with the sandy soils, and in general, those which\r\npossess a high capillary power capable of bringing the moisture rapidly\r\nfrom the deeper layers to the surface. There soon comes a point when the\r\ndifference in evaporation is at its greatest; and then there will be a\r\ngradual diminution until the samples lose no further moisture. This\r\npoint, for the different soils, can be determined by frequent weighings\r\nof the vessel.\r\n\r\n=154. Determination of Capillary Attraction.=—Long glass tubes graduated\r\nin centimeters may be used for this determination, or plain tubes so\r\narranged as to admit of easy measurements with a rule. The tubes may be\r\nfrom one to two centimeters internal diameter and about one meter long.\r\nThe fine earth should be evenly filled in little by little, with gentle\r\njolting. The lower end of each tube, before filling, is closed with a\r\npiece of linen.\r\n\r\nThe tubes, after filling, are supported in an upright position by a\r\nframe AE, Fig. 19, in a vessel B containing water in which the linen\r\ncovered ends D dip to the depth of two centimeters. The height of the\r\nwater in the several tubes should be read or measured at stated\r\nintervals. The water contained in the supply vessel should be kept at a\r\nconstant height by a Mariotte bottle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 19.\r\n\r\n  APPARATUS TO SHOW CAPILLARY ATTRACTION OF SOILS FOR WATER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe observations may be discontinued after one hundred and twenty hours,\r\nbut even then the water will not have reached its maximum height.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended by some experimenters to cut the tubes, after the\r\nabove determination is completed, into pieces ten centimeters in length,\r\nand to determine the per cent of water in each portion.\r\n\r\n=155. Statement of Results.=—The following table illustrates a\r\nconvenient method of tabulating the observed data as given by\r\nKönig.[108]\r\n\r\n Number of sample              1    2    3    4    5    6\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n     Height of      24 hours. 27.3 38.0 16.7 36.4  8.0 28.8 centimeters.\r\n  moisture column\r\n      after:\r\n         „          48   „    35.9 50.8 24.5 49.2 11.9 40.5      „\r\n         „          72   „    41.5 59.5 30.0 57.9 15.2 49.1      „\r\n         „          96   „    44.4 66.2 33.5 63.8 17.5 55.2      „\r\n         „         120   „    46.7 70.0 36.3 68.5 19.2 60.5      „\r\n\r\n=156. Inverse Capillarity.=—In tubes filled with fine earth, as\r\ndescribed in paragraph =154=, water is quickly poured, the same quantity\r\ninto each tube of the same diameter, or such quantities in tubes of\r\ndifferent diameters as would form a water column of the same depth over\r\nthe surface of the sample. The rate at which the water column descends\r\nin each tube, the time of the disappearance of the water at the surface\r\nand the final depth to which it reaches, are the data to be entered.\r\n\r\n=157. Statement of Results.=—The points to be observed in the\r\ndetermination of inverse capillarity are the number of hours required\r\nfor the total absorption of a column of water of a given height, the\r\ndepth of the moisture column at that moment, and the total depth to\r\nwhich the moisture column finally reaches. The data of observations with\r\nsix samples with a water column four centimeters high are given by\r\nKönig[109] as follows:\r\n\r\n        Number of sample         1    2    3    4    5    6\r\n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Number of hours required for\r\n   water to disappear            4.3  1.8 10.3  3.0 21.0  4.3\r\n Depth of moisture at time of\r\n   disappearance of water       11.0 12.0 11.4 13.3 11.7 12.0 centimeters.\r\n Total depth of moisture        13.0 18.1 13.0 19.0 12.0 16.5      „\r\n\r\n=158. Determination of the Coefficient of Evaporation.=—The coefficient\r\nof evaporation is the number of milligrams of water evaporated from a\r\nsquare centimeter of soil surface in a given unit of time. It is evident\r\nthat this number will vary with the physical state of the soil, the\r\nvelocity of the wind, the saturation of the air with aqueous vapor and\r\nthe temperature. In all statements of analyses these factors should\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThe process may be carried on first (a) with soil samples kept\r\ncontinually saturated with water and (b) with samples in which the water\r\nis allowed to gradually dry out.\r\n\r\n_Method a._—The determination may be made in the shade or sunlight.\r\n\r\n_In the Shade._—A zinc cylinder (Z Fig. 20), fifteen centimeters in\r\ndiameter and 7.5 centimeters high, with a rim one centimeter wide and\r\none centimeter from top, is covered at one end with linen or cotton\r\ncloth and filled with fine earth, with gentle jolting, until even with\r\nthe top. It is then placed in a zinc holder H, into the circular opening\r\nof which it snugly fits as in A. This holder is twenty centimeters in\r\ndiameter and 7.5 centimeters deep. It has an opening at O through which\r\nwater can be added until it is filled so as to wet the bottom of Z when\r\nin place. As the water is absorbed by the soil more is added and, the\r\ntop being covered, the apparatus is allowed to stand for twenty-four\r\nhours. At the end of this time the soil in the zinc cylinder is\r\nsaturated with water to the fullest capillary extent.\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus, after putting a stopper in O, is now weighed on a\r\nlarge analytical balance and placed in an open room, with free-air\r\ncirculation, for twenty-four hours. At the end of this time it is again\r\nweighed and the loss of weight calculated to milligrams per square\r\ncentimeter. Where large and delicate balances can not be had, the\r\napparatus can be constructed on a smaller scale suitable for use with a\r\nbalance of the ordinary size.\r\n\r\n_In the Sunlight._—The apparatus described above is enclosed in a wooden\r\nbox having a circular opening the size of the soil-zinc cylinder. In the\r\ndetermination of the rate of evaporation, the apparatus, charged and\r\nweighed as above described, is exposed to the sun for a given period of\r\ntime, say one hour. On the second weighing the loss represents the water\r\nevaporated. The time of year, time of day, velocity of wind and\r\ntemperature, and degree of saturation of the air with aqueous vapor,\r\nshould be noted. The data obtained can then be calculated to milligrams\r\nof water per square centimeter of surface for the unit of time.\r\n\r\n_Method b._—As in method a the determination may be made in the shade or\r\nin the sunlight. The rate of evaporation is, in this method, a\r\ndiminishing one and depends largely on the reserve store of water in the\r\nsample at any given moment.\r\n\r\nThe same piece of apparatus may be used as in the determinations just\r\ndescribed. After charging the sample with moisture all excess of water\r\nin the outer zinc vessel is removed and the rate of evaporation\r\ndetermined by exposure in an open room or in the sunlight, as is done in\r\nthe operations already described.\r\n\r\n_Alternate Method._—The zinc cylinders used in determining saturation\r\ncoefficient, paragraph =145=, may also be employed in determining the\r\nrate of evaporation. Each cylinder should be wrapped with heavy paper or\r\nplaced in a thick cardboard receptacle, and all placed in a wooden box,\r\nthe cover of which is provided with circular perforations, just\r\nadmitting the tops of the cylinders, which should be flush with the\r\nupper surface of the cover.\r\n\r\nArranged in this way the cylinders previously weighed are exposed in the\r\nshade or to direct sunlight and reweighed after a stated interval. On\r\naccount of the small surface here exposed in comparison with the total\r\nquantity of soil and moisture it is recommended to weigh the cylinders\r\nonce only in twenty-four hours. The weighings may be continued for a\r\nfortnight or even a month.\r\n\r\nIn soils fully saturated with water the rate of evaporation is at first\r\nnearly the same on account of the surface being practically that of\r\nwater alone. As the evaporation continues, however, the rate changes\r\nmarkedly with the character of the soil.\r\n\r\n=159. Rapid Method of Wolff.=—In order to expose a larger surface to\r\nevaporation and to secure the results in a shorter period of time,\r\nWolff[110] fills square boxes, having wire-gauze bottoms, with fine\r\nearth, and after saturating with moisture weighs and suspends them in\r\nthe open air. The wire-gauze bottoms are previously covered with filter\r\npaper to prevent loss of soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 20.\r\n\r\n  APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING COEFFICIENT OF EVAPORATION.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=160. Estimation of Water Given up in a Water-Free Atmosphere.=—The\r\nair-dried sample, in quantities of from five to ten grams in a thin\r\nlayer on glass, is placed over a vessel containing strong sulfuric acid.\r\nIt is then placed on a ground glass plate and covered with a bell jar.\r\nThe sample is weighed at intervals of five days until the weight is\r\npractically constant.\r\n\r\nThis method is valuable in giving the actual hygroscopic power of a soil\r\ndepending on its structure alone.\r\n\r\n=161. Estimation of the Porosity of the Soil for the Passage of\r\nGases.=—Some further notion of the physical state of the soil known as\r\nporosity, may also be derived by a study of the rate at which it will\r\nadmit of the transmission of gases. A method for estimating this has\r\nbeen devised by Ammon.[111]\r\n\r\nAir is compressed in two gas holders by means of a column of water of\r\nproper height to give the pressure required.\r\n\r\nThe tubes through which the air passes out of the gas holders are each\r\nfurnished with a stop-cock and united with a glass tube having a side\r\ntube set in at right angles for carrying off the air.\r\n\r\nThe use of two holders makes it possible to carry on the experiment as\r\nlong as may be desired, one holder being filled with air while the other\r\nis emptying.\r\n\r\nThe common conducting tube is joined with a meter which is capable of\r\nmeasuring, to 0.01, the volume of air passing through it. The pressure\r\nis regulated by means of the stop-cocks. The air passing from the meter\r\nis received in a drying tube filled with calcium chlorid.\r\n\r\nFrom the drying tube the air enters a drying flask filled below with\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid and above with pumice stone saturated\r\ntherewith. Next the dried air passes through a worm, eight meters long,\r\nsurrounded with water at a given temperature. The dried air of known\r\ntemperature next enters the experimental tube. This tube is made of\r\nsheet zinc 125 centimeters in length and five centimeters in internal\r\ndiameter. It is placed in an upright position, and about six centimeters\r\nfrom its upper end carries a small tube at right angles to the main one\r\nfor connection with a water-filled manometer.\r\n\r\nThe upper and lower ends of the tube are closed with perforated rubber\r\nstoppers carrying tubes for the entrance and exit of the air.\r\n\r\nIn the inside of the zinc tube are found two close-fitting but movable\r\ndisks, of the finest brass wire gauze, between which the material to be\r\nexperimented upon is held.\r\n\r\nThe layer of fine soil is held between these disks and may be of such a\r\ndepth as is required for the proper progress of the experiment. With\r\nsoils of firm texture opposing a great resistance to the passage of the\r\nair the column of earth tested should be shorter than with light and\r\nvery permeable soils. The experimental tube is surrounded with a water\r\njacket, which may also be made of sheet zinc, carrying small tubes\r\ndirected upwards for holding thermometers. The water jacket should be\r\nkept at the same temperature as the air which is used in the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe process of filling the tube, the amount of pressure to be used and\r\nthe air and soil temperature, will naturally vary in different\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\nThe volume of air at a given pressure and temperature which passes a\r\ncolumn of soil of a given length in a unit of time will give the\r\ncoefficient of permeability.\r\n\r\n=162. Determination of Permeability in the Open Field.=—A method for\r\ndetermining the rate of transmission of a gas through the soil in the\r\nfield has been devised by Heinrich.[112]\r\n\r\nA box C (Fig. 21) is made of strong sheet iron and has an opening below,\r\nten centimeters square, and a height of about twenty centimeters. At\r\nexactly ten centimeters from the bottom, the box has a rim at right\r\nangles to its length so that it can be placed only ten centimeters deep\r\nin the soil. The box holds a volume of earth equal to 1,000 cubic\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 21.\r\n\r\n  METHOD OF HEINRICH.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe part of the box above ground is connected with the bottle B by a\r\nglass tube as indicated in the figure. The bottle B should have a\r\ncapacity of about ten liters. The air in B is forced out through C by\r\nwater running in from the supply A and the pressure in B is recorded by\r\nthe manometer D. The experiment should be tried on a soil thoroughly\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\nIn measuring the pressure in B the water pressure should be cut off by\r\nthe pinch-cock between A and B, and the pressure on the manometer\r\nobserved after the lapse of one to two minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              MOVEMENT OF WATER THROUGH SOILS: LYSIMETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=163. Porosity in Relation to Water Movement.=—The intimate relation\r\nwhich water movement in a soil bears to fertility makes highly important\r\nthe analytical study of this feature of porosity. A soil deficient in\r\nplant food, in so far as chemical analysis is concerned, will produce\r\nfar better crops when the flow of moisture is favorable than a highly\r\nfertile soil in which the water may be in deficiency or excess.\r\n\r\nAside from the actual rain-fall the texture of the soil, in other words\r\nits porosity, is the most important factor in determining the proper\r\nsupply of moisture to the rootlets of plants. Even where the rain-fall\r\nis little, a properly porous soil in contact with a moist subsoil will\r\nfurnish the moisture necessary to plant growth. This fact is well\r\nillustrated by the beet fields in Chino Valley, California. In this\r\nlocality most excellent crops of sugar beets are produced without\r\nirrigation and almost without rain.\r\n\r\n=164. Methods of Water Movement=—The translocation of soil water is\r\noccasioned in at least two ways; namely,\r\n\r\n1. By changing the porosity of a given stratum of soil.\r\n\r\n2. By changing the amount of water a given stratum contains.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment by King[113] illustrates a convenient method of\r\nstudying this movement of water:\r\n\r\nOn a rich fallow ground of light clay soil, underlaid at a depth of\r\neighteen inches by a medium-grained sand, water, to the amount of two\r\npounds per square foot on an area of eight by eight feet, was slowly\r\nadded with a sprinkler, samples of soil having been previously taken in\r\nsix-inch sections down to a depth of three feet. The samples were taken\r\nalong a diagonal of the square under experiment and one foot apart. The\r\nmiddle sample of the line being from the center of the area. The\r\nsampling and wetting occurred between one and three P. M., on July 22,\r\nand on the evening of the 23 a corresponding series of samples was taken\r\nalong a line parallel to the first but eight inches distant. The changes\r\nin the percentages of water in the soil are given in the following\r\ntable, showing the translocation of water in soil due to wetting the\r\nsurface:\r\n\r\n                   PER CENT OF WATER.

It\r\nwill be seen that while only two pounds of water to the square foot were\r\nadded to the surface, the upper six inches contained 2.87 pounds per\r\nsquare foot more than before the water was added, and the second six\r\ninches contained 0.199 pound more, and this too in the face of the fact\r\nthat the evaporation per square foot from a tray sitting on a pair of\r\nscales close by, was 0.428 pound during the interval under\r\nconsideration. Similar experiments were made by taking the samples of\r\nsoil at 5.30 P. M. in one-foot sections down to four feet, at four\r\nequally distant places along the diagonal of a square, six by six feet,\r\nand having the ground sprinkled. At the same time four similar sets of\r\nsamples were taken on lines vertical to each of the sides of the square\r\nbut four feet distant from them. The amount of water the soil contained\r\nwas then determined, and at 11.30 A. M., nineteen hours later, another\r\nseries of samples was taken at points about four inches distant from the\r\nlast and the amount of water determined with the result given below.\r\n\r\n        TRANSLATION OF WATER OCCASIONED BY WETTING THE SURFACE.\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n   Depth of   │\r\n   samples.   │                       WET AREA.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────────────╥───────────────────────────\r\n       „      │      Before wetting.      ║      After wetting.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────╫─────────────┬─────────────\r\n       „      │             │  Pounds of  ║             │  Pounds of\r\n              │ Per cent of │  water per  ║ Per cent of │  water per\r\n              │   water.    │ cubic foot. ║   water.    │ cubic foot.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────╫─────────────┼─────────────\r\n  0–12 inches │        16.86│        11.78║        20.15│        14.06\r\n 12–24  „     │        17.76│        15.79║        19.71│        17.52\r\n 24–36  „     │        16.76│        14.73║        17.72│        15.58\r\n 36–48  „     │        15.01│        14.03║        16.47│        15.40\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────╫─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Averages     │        16.59│        14.08║        18.51│        15.64\r\n              │             │             ║             │\r\n Total amount │             │             ║             │\r\n   of water   │             │        56.33║             │        62.56\r\n Amount of    │             │             ║             │\r\n   change     │             │             ║             │        +6.23\r\n ─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────╨─────────────┴─────────────\r\n\r\n ─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n   Depth of   │\r\n   samples.   │                     AREA NOT WET.\r\n ─────────────┼───────────────────────────╥───────────────────────────\r\n       „      │      First samples.       ║      Second samples.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────╫─────────────┬─────────────\r\n       „      │             │  Pounds of  ║             │  Pounds of\r\n              │ Per cent of │  water per  ║ Per cent of │  water per\r\n              │   water.    │ cubic foot. ║   water.    │ cubic foot.\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────╫─────────────┼─────────────\r\n  0–12 inches │        17.72│        12.38║        18.27│        12.75\r\n 12–24  „     │        19.18│        17.05║        19.94│        17.72\r\n 24–36  „     │        16.97│        14.92║        17.52│        15.40\r\n 36–48  „     │        15.49│        14.48║        15.16│        14.17\r\n ─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────╫─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Averages     │        17.34│        14.71║        17.71│        15.01\r\n              │             │             ║             │\r\n Total amount │             │             ║             │\r\n   of water   │             │        58.83║             │        60.04\r\n Amount of    │             │             ║             │\r\n   change     │             │             ║             │        +1.21\r\n ─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────╨─────────────┴─────────────\r\n\r\nThe above data show sufficiently well the method of investigation to be\r\npursued in studies of this kind.\r\n\r\n=165. Capillary Movement of Water.=—The method of investigation proposed\r\nby King[114] consists in taking samples of soil at intervals of one,\r\ntwo, three, or four feet in depth, and determining the amount of\r\nmoisture in each in connection with the amount of rain-fall during the\r\nperiod. The quantity of water contained in a given soil, at various\r\ndepths and on different dates, is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n    Depth in   Date.

Lateral Capillary Flow.=—To determine the lateral capillary flow\r\nof water in a soil the following method, used by King[115] may be\r\nemployed:\r\n\r\nA zinc lined tray, six by six feet in area and eight inches deep, is\r\nfilled with a soil well packed. In one corner of this tray a section of\r\nfive inches of unglazed drainage tile, having its lower end broken and\r\njagged, is set and the dirt well filled in round it. By means of a\r\nMariotte bottle water is constantly maintained in the bottom of this\r\ntile, three-quarters of an inch deep, so that it will flow laterally by\r\ncapillary action into the adjacent soil, the object being to determine\r\nthe extent and rate of capillary flow laterally.\r\n\r\nThe water content of the soil is determined at the time of starting the\r\nexperiment, on the circumferences of circles described with the tile as\r\na center, the distance between the circles being one foot. At stated\r\nperiods, usually at intervals of one day, the content of moisture is\r\nagain determined at the same points. The investigations show that the\r\nlateral movement of water in the soil is not rapid enough to extend much\r\nbeyond three feet in thirty-one days, for beyond that distance the soil\r\nwas found to be drier than at the beginning of the experiment. A record\r\nis to be kept of the amount of water delivered to the soil by weighing\r\nthe supply bottle at intervals, and the rates given at which the soil\r\ntakes up the water in grams per hour and pounds per day. Also the amount\r\nof flow per square foot of soil section together with the mean daily\r\nevaporation should be noted. The mean flow per foot of soil section is\r\ncomputed on the assumption that the outer face of the zone of completely\r\nsaturated soil is the delivering surface. In King’s work this point, as\r\nnearly as could be determined, was twelve inches from the corner of the\r\ntray and hence the figures at best can only be regarded as\r\napproximations. The method of stating results is shown in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n    SHOWING THE RATE OF LATERAL CAPILLARY FLOW OF WATER IN CLAY LOAM.\r\n\r\n   Date.

After twenty days the flow dropped again to the\r\nbeginning rate and then fell below, but remained quite constant during\r\nthe following nineteen days. For the sake of uniformity in units of\r\nmeasure the daily quantity of flow should be given in kilograms when the\r\nhourly flow is given in grams.\r\n\r\n=167. Causes of Water Movement in the Soil.=—The movement of water in a\r\nsoil as explained by Whitney[116] is due to two forces, _viz._,\r\ngravitation and surface tension.\r\n\r\nThe force of gravitation in a given locality is always uniform, both in\r\ndirection and magnitude per unit volume of water.\r\n\r\nSurface tension is the tendency of any exposed water surface to pull\r\nitself together. It may act in any direction, according to\r\ncircumstances, and may thus sometimes help and sometimes antagonize the\r\nforce of gravitation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of surface tension any particle of moisture tends\r\nto assume the smallest possible area. This tendency is a constant\r\ndefinite force per unit of surface at a given temperature. In the soil\r\nthis constant strain on the free surface of water particles serves, in a\r\nhigh degree, to move them from place to place, in harmony with the\r\nrequirements of the different portions of the field.\r\n\r\nWhen a soil is only slightly moist the water clings to its grains in the\r\nform of a thin film. When these soil particles are brought together the\r\nfilms of water surrounding them unite, one surface being in contact with\r\nthe soil particles and the other exposed to the air. If more water enter\r\nthe soil the film thickens until finally, when the point of saturation\r\nis reached, all the space between the soil particles becomes filled with\r\nwater, and surface tension within the soil is thus reduced to zero.\r\nGravity then alone acts on the water and with a maximum force.\r\n\r\nIn a cubic foot of ordinary soil the total surface of the soil particles\r\nwill be at least 50,000 square feet. It follows that when the soil is\r\nonly slightly moist the exposed water surface of the films surrounding\r\nthe soil particles approximates that of the particles themselves. If\r\nsuch a mass of slightly moist soil be brought in contact with a like\r\nmass saturated with water, the films of water at the point of contact\r\nwill begin to thicken in the nearly dry soil at the expense of the water\r\ncontent of the saturated mass. The water will thus be moved in any\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nDuring evaporation the surface tension near the surface of the soil is\r\nincreased, and water is thus drawn from below. In like manner, when rain\r\nfalls on a somewhat dry soil, the surface tension is diminished and the\r\ngreater surface tension below pulls the moisture down even when\r\ngravitation would not be sufficient for that purpose.\r\n\r\nCertain fertilizers have the faculty of modifying surface tension and\r\nthus change the power of the soil in its attraction for moisture. In\r\nthis way such fertilizers act favorably on plant growth, both by\r\nproviding plant food and by supplying needed moisture.\r\n\r\n=168. Surface Tension of Fertilizers.=—Whitney gives the following data\r\nin respect of the surface tension of aqueous solutions of some of the\r\nmore common fertilizing materials. It is expressed in gram meters per\r\nsquare meter, _i. e._, on a square meter of liquid surface there is\r\nsufficient energy to lift the given number of grams to the height of one\r\nmeter.\r\n\r\n           SURFACE TENSION OF VARIOUS FERTILIZING SOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n     Solution of—    Specific gravity.

Method of Estimating Surface Tension.=—The determination of\r\nsurface tension is made by measuring the rise of the liquid in a\r\ncapillary tube. A short piece of thermometer tubing is used, the\r\ndiameter of the bore being determined by careful microscopic\r\nmeasurements with a micrometer eyepiece. The diameter of the tube should\r\nbe about 0.5578 millimeter. The tube is very thoroughly cleaned after\r\neach observation, or set of observations, with a strong caustic potash\r\nsolution, and, after washing, is allowed to stand for some time in a\r\nsaturated solution of potassium bichromate in strong sulfuric acid. The\r\nheight of the rise in the capillary tube is measured with a\r\ncathetometer.\r\n\r\nThe following formula is used for the calculation of the results:\r\n\r\n                       T = (_h d_ ω)/(4 cos. _a_)\r\n\r\nWhere T is the surface tension, _d_ is the diameter of the tube in\r\ncentimeters; _h_ the height to which the liquid rises in the capillary\r\ntube in centimeters; ω is the specific gravity of the solution; and 4\r\ncos. _a_ refers to the angle of the liquid with the sides of the glass\r\ntube. For a tube of the size given above, 5° 24′ is the value of this\r\nedge angle. In regard to saline solutions, Quincke[117] says, that the\r\nedge angle appears to increase a little with augmenting concentration of\r\nthe saline solution, but otherwise to differ only inconsiderably from\r\nthe edge angle of pure water.\r\n\r\n=170. Effect of the Solutions on Surface Tension.=—The mineral\r\nfertilizers, as a rule, increase the surface tension of water, while\r\norganic matters in solution decrease it. But it must not be forgotten in\r\nthis connection that but little of the organic matter in the fertilizers\r\nemployed for the experiment passes into solution. Moreover, with these\r\nsubstances, the accuracy of the work is impaired somewhat by the\r\nincreased viscosity. In general, the results of the experiment are in\r\nharmony with the well-known effect of magnesium, sodium, and potassium\r\nchlorids, and sodium nitrate, to make the soil more moist in dry\r\nweather, and the opposite effect produced by the application of organic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n=171. Method of Preparing Soil Extracts.=—The soil extracts used in\r\ndetermining the surface tension, as given in the above table, are\r\nprepared as follows:\r\n\r\nTen grams of the soil are rubbed up with fifteen to twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of distilled water and allowed to stand for twenty-four\r\nhours with frequent stirring. Any fine particles not removable by a\r\nfilter are neglected, although they may give a turbid appearance to the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n=172. Lysimetry.=—The process of measuring the capacity of a soil to\r\npermit the passage of water and of collecting and determining the amount\r\nof flow and determining soluble matters therein is known as lysimetry.\r\nIn general, the rate at which water will pass through a soil depends on\r\nthe fineness and approximation of its particles. Water will pass through\r\ncoarse sand almost as rapidly as through a tube, while a fine clay may\r\nbe almost impervious. The study of the phenomena of filtration through\r\nsoil, and the methods of quantitatively estimating them, are therefore\r\nclosely related to porosity.\r\n\r\nTwo cases are to be considered, _viz._: First, percolation through\r\nsamples of soil prepared for analysis, and second, the passage of the\r\nwater through soil _in situ_, whether it be virgin or cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the rate of flow through a soil in laboratory\r\nsamples, gives valuable information in respect of its physical\r\nproperties, while the same determination made on the soil _in situ_, has\r\npractical relations to the supply of moisture, to growing plants, and\r\nthe waste of valuable plant food in the drainage waters. The\r\ndetermination of the rate of flow of water through a small sample,\r\ndisturbed as little as possible in its natural condition, is classed\r\nwith the first divisions of the work, inasmuch as the removal of a\r\nsample of soil from a field, and its transfer to the laboratory,\r\nsubjects it to artificial conditions, even if its texture be but little\r\ndisturbed by the removal.\r\n\r\n=173. Calculation of the Relative Rate of Flow of Water Through\r\nSoils.=—There will evidently be one space, or opening, into the soil for\r\nevery surface grain, as pointed out by Whitney,[118] and the approximate\r\nnumber of grains, or of openings, on a unit area of surface may be found\r\nby the following formula:\r\n\r\n                         N = (√((M × W)/(V))^⅔\r\n\r\nwhere N is the number of grains, or openings, on one square centimeter\r\nof surface, M is the approximate number of grains in one gram of soil, W\r\nis the weight of soil, V is the total volume of the soil grains and the\r\nempty space.\r\n\r\nIf the grains are assumed to be symmetrically arranged and the spaces\r\nbetween them cylindrical in form, the radii of the spaces can be found\r\nby the following formula:\r\n\r\n                           _r_ = √(V₁)/(πNL)\r\n\r\nwhere _r_ is the radius of a single space, V is the total volume of the\r\nempty space, N is the number of grains or spaces on one square\r\ncentimeter of surface, and L is the depth of the soil.\r\n\r\nIf the space within the soil is completely filled with water the\r\nrelative rate of flow of water through the soil will be according to the\r\nfourth power of the radius of a single space multiplied by the number of\r\nspaces on the unit area of surface, as shown by the following formula:\r\n\r\n                      T₁ = (N(_r_)⁴T)/(N₁(_r_₁)⁴)\r\n\r\nwhere N-N₁ are the numbers of spaces, and _r_-_r_₁ are the radii of\r\nsingle spaces in the respective soils, and T-T₁ the times required for a\r\nunit volume of water to flow through the soils under the same head or\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe space within the soil is rarely filled with water in agricultural\r\nlands, and the most favorable amount of water for the soil to hold, as\r\nHellriegel and others have shown, is from thirty to fifty per cent of\r\nthe total amount of water the soil can hold if all the space within it\r\nwere filled.\r\n\r\nIf the space within the soil be only partly filled with water, as in\r\nmost arable lands, the water will move in a thin film surrounding the\r\nsoil grains and according to the fourth power of the thickness of the\r\nfilm. The mean thickness of the film surrounding the soil grains may be\r\ntheoretically determined by the following formula, which is based on the\r\nconception that the film is cylindrical and of uniform size throughout:\r\n\r\n                   _t_ = _r_(1 − √(_s_)/(_s_ + _p_))\r\n\r\nwhere _s_ is the per cent by weight of water which the soil will hold\r\nwhen the empty space is filled with water, _p_ the per cent of water\r\nactually contained in the soil, _r_ the radius of a single space, and\r\n_t_ the mean thickness of the film surrounding the soil grains.\r\n\r\nThe relative rate of flow of water through the soils will then be\r\naccording to the following formula:\r\n\r\n                      T₁ = (N(_t_)⁴T)/(N₁(_t_)₁⁴))\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that these formulæ give only approximate and\r\ncomparative values for comparing one soil with another. The structure of\r\nthe soil is altogether too intricate to expect ever to obtain absolute\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nIf the observed rate of flow varies widely from the relative rate\r\ncalculated from the mechanical analysis, it will indicate a difference\r\nin the arrangement of the soil grains, or in the amount or condition of\r\nthe organic matter in the soils. In the older agricultural regions of\r\nthe United States, south of the influence of the glacial action, the\r\ngreat soil areas appear to have sensibly similar arrangements of the\r\nsoil grains, and sensibly uniform conditions of organic matter, save\r\nwhere these have been modified by local conditions.\r\n\r\n=174. Measurement of Rate of Percolation in a Soil Sample.=—In order to\r\nmeasure the power of the soil for permitting the passage of water, a\r\nbox, about twenty-five centimeters high and having a cross section of\r\nabout three centimeters square, is used. Below, this box has a\r\nfunnel-shaped end with a narrow outlet tube, which at its lower end is\r\nclosed with cotton, in such a way that a portion of the cotton extends\r\nthrough the stem of the funnel. A little coarse quartz sand is scattered\r\nover the cotton and afterwards the funnel part of the apparatus filled\r\nwith it. The sand and the cotton are saturated with water and the\r\napparatus weighed. The box is then filled with the fine sample of earth,\r\nwith light tapping, until the depth of earth has reached about sixteen\r\ncentimeters. The apparatus, after the addition of the air-dried earth,\r\nis again weighed to determine the amount of earth added, and the soil is\r\nthen saturated by the careful addition of water. After the excess of\r\nwater has run down the funnel, the total quantity of absorbed water is\r\ndetermined by reweighing the apparatus and the total water-holding power\r\nof the soil is determined. There is carefully added, without stirring up\r\nthe surface of the soil, a column of water eight centimeters high,\r\nmaking in all from sixty to seventy grams. The time is observed until\r\nthe water ceases to drip from the funnel. The dripping begins\r\nimmediately after the water is poured on and ceases as soon as the\r\nliquid on the surface of the soil has completely disappeared. On the\r\nrepetition of this operation a longer time for the passage of the water\r\nis almost always required than at the first time. The experiment,\r\ntherefore, must be tried three or four times and the mean taken.\r\n\r\n=175. Method of Welitschowsky.=[119]—The soil is placed in the vessel\r\n_a_, Fig. 22, which is cylindrical in shape and five centimeters in\r\ndiameter. The lower end of the cylinder is closed with a fine wire-gauze\r\ndisk and the upper end is provided with an enlargement for the reception\r\nof the tube _b_, which is connected to _a_ with a wide rubber band. The\r\nlower end of the tube _b_ is also closed with a wire-gauze disk. These\r\ntubes may be conveniently made of sheet zinc. The tube _b_ carries on\r\nthe side, at distances of ten centimeters, small tubes of fifteen\r\nmillimeters diameter. On the opposite side it is provided with a glass\r\ntube set into a side tube near the bottom for the purpose of showing the\r\nheight of the water. The side tube carrying the water meter is provided\r\nwith a stop-cock as shown in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 22.\r\n\r\n  METHOD OF WELITSCHOWSKY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn conducting the experiment, after the apparatus has been arranged as\r\ndescribed, the small lateral tubes are, with one exception, closed with\r\nstoppers. On the open one, _d_, a rubber tube is fixed for the purpose\r\nof removing the water. The required water pressure is secured by taking\r\nthe lateral opening corresponding to the pressure required. Water is\r\nintroduced into the apparatus slowly through the glass tube _f_.\r\n\r\nThe water rises to _d_ and then any excess flows off through _e_. By a\r\nproper regulation of the water supply the pressure is kept constant at\r\n_d_. The water flowing off through _a_ is collected by the funnel and\r\ndelivered to graduated flasks where its quantity can be measured for any\r\ngiven unit of time. Since the rate of flow at first shows variations,\r\nthe measurement should not be commenced until after the flow becomes\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nIn general, the experiments should last ten hours, and, beginning with a\r\nwater pressure of 100 centimeters, be repeated successively with\r\npressures of eighty, sixty, forty, and twenty, centimeters, etc. In\r\ncoarse soils, or with sand, one hour is long enough for the experiment.\r\n\r\n=176.

Clay (kaolin) and humus (peat) are almost impermeable for water, and\r\nfine quartz and limestone dust are also very impermeable.\r\n\r\n2. The permeability of a soil for water increases as the particles of\r\nthe soil increase in size, and when particles of different sizes are\r\nmixed together the permeability approaches that of the finer particles.\r\n\r\n3. The quantity of water passing through a given thickness of soil\r\nincreases with the water pressure but is not proportional thereto,\r\nincreasing less rapidly than the pressure.\r\n\r\n4. The quantity of water passing under a given pressure is inversely\r\nproportional to the thickness of the soil layer when the particles are\r\nvery fine and the pressure high.\r\n\r\n=177. Method of Whitney.=—To determine the permeability of the soil or\r\nsubsoil to water or air, in its natural position in the field, the\r\nfollowing method, due to Whitney, can be recommended:\r\n\r\nA hole should be dug, and the soil and subsoil on one side removed to\r\nthe depth at which the observation is to be made. A column of the soil\r\nor subsoil, two inches or more square, and four or five inches deep, is\r\nthen to be carved out with a broad bladed knife, or a small saw can be\r\nconveniently used for cutting this out. A glass or metal frame, a little\r\nlarger than the sample and three or four inches deep, is slipped over\r\nthe column of soil, and melted paraffin is run in slowly to fill up the\r\nspace between the soil and the frame. The soil is then struck off even\r\nwith the top and bottom of the frame, preferably with a saw, or at any\r\nrate taking care not to smooth it over with a knife, which would disturb\r\nthe surface and affect the rate of flow. The frame is then placed upon\r\nsome coarse sand or gravel, contained in a funnel, to prevent the soil\r\nfrom falling out and to provide good drainage for the water to pass\r\nthrough. Another similar frame can then be placed on top and secured by\r\na wide rubber band. A little coarse sand, which has been thoroughly\r\nwashed and dried, is then placed on the soil, and water carefully poured\r\non until it is level with the top of the frame. When the water begins to\r\ndrop from the funnel more water must be added to the top, so as to have\r\nthe initial depth of water over the soil the same in all the\r\nexperiments. A graduated glass is then pushed under the funnel, and the\r\ntime noted which is required for a quantity of water to pass through the\r\nsoil. The quantity usually taken for measurement is equivalent to one\r\ninch in depth over the soil surface. In taking the sample, root and\r\nworm-holes are to be avoided, and these are particularly troublesome in\r\nclay lands.\r\n\r\n=178. Measurement of Percolation through the Soil in Situ.=—If lateral\r\ntranslocation could be prevented, the measurement of the quantity of\r\nwater descending in the soil through a given area would be a matter of\r\nsimplicity. But to secure accurate results all lateral communication of\r\na given body of soil with adjacent portions must be cut off. Various\r\ndevices have been adopted to secure this result. An elaborate system of\r\nlysimetric measurements is illustrated by the apparatus erected by the\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station, of Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe plan and section of the apparatus are shown in Fig. 23.\r\n\r\nEach lysimeter box, when finished, resembles somewhat a hogshead with\r\none head out. The sides, however, are perfectly straight inside, having\r\na slight thickening in the center, on the outside, for making them\r\nstronger. The sides and bottom of the apparatus are constructed of oak\r\nand lined with sheet copper carefully soldered so as to be water-tight.\r\nSix inches above, and parallel to the bottom of each of the boxes, is a\r\nperforated copper tube, which extends entirely across the lysimeter, and\r\npassing through one of the sides connects the box with an underground\r\nvault in which the observations are taken. These tubes give an outlet to\r\nthe drainage water, as described further on. The lysimeters are made of\r\nany required depth, the two which are shown in section being three and\r\ntwo-thirds and six and two-thirds feet deep, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe following method is employed for filling them with soil: There are\r\nfirst placed in the bottom of each lysimeter six inches of fine sand,\r\nsifted and washed, which fills them up to the level of the drainage\r\ntubes. The lysimeters are then filled with fine, sifted surface soil, to\r\nthe depth of three and six feet, respectively, making a complete pair of\r\nlysimeters, and leaving two inches of the lysimeter boxes projecting\r\nabove the surface of the soil so that each one will receive exactly its\r\nproper share of the rain-fall.\r\n\r\nThe lysimeters of the other pair, which are the same size as the first,\r\nare filled in a different way. The lysimeters are first constructed and\r\nplaced over vertical columns of soil _in situ_, which are obtained by\r\ndigging away all the surrounding soil and leaving the columns standing.\r\nThe shorter lysimeter is sunk in this way to within two inches of its\r\nentire length. It is then tipped over carrying the column of soil with\r\nit. Six inches of the subsoil are then removed, when the drainage tube\r\nand sand are put in, as in the first pair, and the bottom of the tube\r\nsoldered in place. The lysimeter is thus filled with the natural soil in\r\nplace. The longer box is in the same way filled, as far as possible,\r\nwith the soil in place, but a gravelly nature of the soil may render it\r\nimpossible to do the filling with a single column unbroken, so the\r\ngravel and sand from the lower portion of the soil are to be filled in\r\nseparately. The drainage tube and bottom of sand are placed in the\r\nlonger lysimeter in the same way as in the shorter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 23.\r\n\r\n  GROUND PLAN AND VERTICAL SECTION OF LYSIMETERS AND VAULTS SHOWING\r\n    POSITION OF THE APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n  1, 1, 1, 1, Lysimeters.\r\n  2, 2, 2, 2, Receiving bottles.\r\n  3, 3, Supplying apparatus.\r\n  4, 4, Skylights.\r\n  5, 5, 5, 5, Wall of vault.\r\n  6, 6, Brick walls.\r\n  7, Entrance Steps.\r\n  8, Vault.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of placing sand at the bottom of each lysimeter is to offer\r\na porous stratum in which free water may collect and rise to the level\r\nof the perforated copper tube, which would prevent any further rise by\r\nconveying the surplus above into the vault as drainage water. The soil\r\nabove the tube will therefore be constantly drained and the sand below\r\nconstantly saturated, unless the water be drawn up by the capillary\r\naction of the soil as the result of evaporation from the surface.\r\n\r\nBy means of a proper arrangement within the vault, of a kind of\r\nMariotte’s bottle, the water may be caused to flow back through the\r\ndrainage tube into the lysimeter to take the place of that lost by\r\nevaporation, and thus maintain the level of free water just below the\r\ndrainage tube. The water flowing back to the lysimeter, and the amount\r\nof drainage water, are carefully measured by a system of graduated\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nThe lysimeters thus constructed represent tile-drained land; in one case\r\nthe tile being three feet below the surface and in the other six feet\r\nbelow. The drainage waters collected in the receiving bottles can be\r\nmeasured and analyzed from time to time, as occasion may require, to\r\ndetermine the amount of plant food which is removed.\r\n\r\n=179. Improved Method of Deherain.=[120]—Deherain’s earlier experiments\r\nwere made in pots containing about sixty kilos of soil. These vases\r\nserve very well for some kinds of plants, but there are other kinds\r\nwhich do not grow at all normally when their roots are imprisoned. For\r\ninstance, in pots, even of the largest size, wheat is always poor, beets\r\nirregular, maize never acquires its full development, and the\r\nconclusions which can be drawn from the experiments can not be\r\npredicated of the action of the plant under conditions entirely normal.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary therefore to carry on the work in an entirely different\r\nway, and to construct boxes so large as to make the conditions of growth\r\nentirely normal. The arrangement of these boxes is shown in Fig. 24.\r\n\r\nThey are placed in a large trench, two meters wide, one meter deep, and\r\nforty meters long. There are twenty boxes in this trench, the upper\r\nsurface of each containing four square meters area. The boxes are one\r\nmeter deep, and therefore can contain four cubic meters of soil. The\r\nsides and bottoms of the boxes are made of iron lattice work, covered\r\nwith a cement which renders them impervious to water.\r\n\r\nThe bottom inclines from the sides towards the middle, and from the back\r\nto the front, thus forming a gutter which permits of the easy collection\r\nof the drainage. The drainage water is conveyed, by means of a pipe and\r\na funnel, into a demijohn placed in the ditch in front of the apparatus,\r\nas shown in the figure. These receptacles stand in niches under the\r\nfront of the cases, and are separated by the brick foundations. Access\r\nto them is gained by means of the inclined plane shown in the figure,\r\nand this plane permits the demijohns in which the drainage water is\r\ncollected, to be removed with a wheelbarrow for the purpose of weighing.\r\nThis apparatus is especially suitable for a study of the distribution of\r\nthe nitrogen to the crop, the soil and the drainage waters. The loss in\r\ndrainage waters of potash and phosphoric acid is insignificant in\r\ncomparison with the loss in nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe cases having been placed in position they are filled with the\r\nnatural soil, which is taken to the depth of one meter, in such a way\r\nthat the relative positions of the soil and subsoil are not changed.\r\n\r\nWhile the soil is transferring to the cases it is carefully sampled in\r\norder to have a portion representing accurately the composition of both\r\nthe soil and subsoil. These samples are subjected to analysis and the\r\nquantities of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash contained therein\r\ncarefully noted.\r\n\r\nOne or two cases should be left without crop or fertilizer to determine\r\nthe relations of the soil and subsoil to the rain-fall. Three or four\r\ncases should be kept free of vegetation and receive treatment with\r\ndifferent fertilizer, in order to determine the influences of these on\r\nthe deportment of the soil to rain-fall. The rest of the cases should be\r\nseeded with plants representing the predominant field culture of the\r\nlocality, and some of them should be fertilized with the usual manures\r\nused in farm culture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 24.\r\n\r\n  DEHERAIN’S APPARATUS FOR COLLECTING DRAINAGE WATER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AUTHORITIES CITED IN PART THIRD.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  Comptes rendus, Tome 112, p. 598.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Stockbridge, Rocks and Soils, p. 153.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  Die Landwirtschaftlichen Versuchs-Stationen, Band 8, S. 40.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  König, Untersuchung Landwirtschaftlich und Gewerblich Wichtiger\r\n  Stoffe, S. 48.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Methods of Swedish Agricultural Chemists, translated for author by F.\r\n  W.

Relation of Flocculation to Mechanical Analysis.=—The tendency of\r\nthe fine particles of silt to form aggregates, which act as distinct\r\nparticles of matter, is the chief difficulty connected with the\r\nseparation of the soil into portions of equal hydraulic value by the\r\nsilt method of analysis. This tendency has been discussed fully by\r\nJohnson[121] and Hilgard.[122]\r\n\r\n=181. Illustration of Flocculation.=—A sediment, consisting of particles\r\nof a hydraulic value, equal to one millimeter per second, is introduced\r\ninto an ordinary conical elutriating tube placed vertically, in which\r\nthe current of water entering below performs all the stirring which the\r\nparticles receive.\r\n\r\nA current of water corresponding to a velocity below one millimeter per\r\nsecond will, of course, not carry any of the particles out at the top of\r\nthe cylindrical tube, but will keep them moving through the conical\r\nportion of the tube. If now the current be increased until its velocity\r\nis greater than one millimeter per second after having run at the slower\r\nvelocity for fifteen or twenty minutes, very little of the sediment will\r\npass over, although theoretically the whole of it should. Even at a\r\nvelocity of five millimeters per second, much of the sediment will\r\nremain in the tube. This, of course, is due to the coagulation of the\r\nparticles into molecular aggregates having a higher hydraulic value even\r\nthan five millimeters per second. These aggregates can be broken up by\r\nviolent stirring or moderate boiling, and the sediment reduced again to\r\nits proper value. The conclusions which Hilgard derives from a study of\r\nthe above phenomena are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The tendency to coagulation is, roughly, in an inverse ratio to the\r\nsize of the particles. With quartz grains it practically ceases when\r\ntheir diameter exceeds about two-tenths of a millimeter having a\r\nhydraulic value of eight millimeters per second. The size of the\r\naggregates formed follows practically the same law as above. Sediment of\r\n0.25 millimeter hydraulic value will sometimes form large masses like\r\nsnow-flakes on the sides of the elutriator tube.\r\n\r\n2. The degree of agitation which will resolve the aggregates into single\r\ngrains is inversely as the size of the particles; or, more properly\r\nperhaps, inversely as their hydraulic value.\r\n\r\n3. The tendency to flocculation varies inversely as the temperature. So\r\nmuch so is this the case that Hilgard at one time contemplated the use\r\nof water at the boiling point in the mechanical analysis of soils, in\r\nplace of mechanical stirring.\r\n\r\n4. The presence of alcohol, ether, and of caustic or carbonated\r\nalkalies, diminishes the tendency to flocculation, while the presence of\r\nacids and neutral salts increases it.\r\n\r\n5. As between sediments of equal hydraulic value, but different\r\ndensities, the tendency to flocculation seems to be greater with the\r\nless dense particles.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the mechanical actions which take place between the\r\nparticles, Hilgard considers them as irregular spheroids, each of which\r\ncan at best come in contact at three points with any other particle. The\r\ncause of aggregation cannot therefore be mere surface adhesion\r\nindependent of the liquid, and the particles being submerged there is no\r\nmeniscus to create an adhesive tension.\r\n\r\nSince experiment shows that the flocculative tendency is measurably\r\nincreased by the cohesion coefficient of the liquid, it seems necessary\r\nto assume that capillary films of the latter interposed between the\r\nsurfaces of solids create a considerable adhesive tension even in the\r\nabsence of a meniscus.\r\n\r\n=182. Effect of Potential of Surface Particles.=—Whitney suggests that\r\nthis is due to the potential of the surface particles of solids and\r\nliquids.[123] The potential of a single water particle is the work which\r\nwould be required to pull it away from the surrounding water particles\r\nand remove it beyond their sphere of attraction. For simplicity, it may\r\nbe described as the total force of attraction between a single particle\r\nand all other particles which surround it. With this definition, it will\r\nbe seen that the potential of a particle on an exposed surface of water\r\nis only one-half of the potential in the interior of the mass, as half\r\nof the particles which formerly surrounded and attracted it were removed\r\nwhen the other exposed surface of water was separated from it. A\r\nparticle on an exposed surface of water, being under a low potential,\r\nwill therefore tend to move toward the center of the mass where the\r\npotential, _i. e._, the total attraction, is greater, and the surface\r\nwill tend to contract so as to leave the fewest possible number of\r\nparticles on the surface. This is surface tension.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of air, there is a solid substance in contact with the\r\nwater, the potential will be greater than on an exposed surface of the\r\nliquid, for the much greater number of solid particles will have a\r\ngreater attraction for the water particles than the air particles had.\r\nThey may have so great an attraction that the water particle on this\r\nsurface, separating the solid and liquid, may be under greater potential\r\nthan prevails in the interior of the liquid mass. Then the surface will\r\ntend to expand as much as possible, for the particles in the interior of\r\nthe mass of liquid will try to get out on the surface. This is the\r\nreverse of surface tension. It is surface pressure, which may exist on a\r\nsurface separating a solid and liquid.\r\n\r\nMuddy water may remain turbid for an indefinite time, but if a trace of\r\nlime or salt be added to the water the grains of clay flocculate, that\r\nis, they come together in loose, light flocks, like curdled milk, and\r\nsettle quickly to the bottom, leaving the liquid above them clear.\r\nAmmonia and some other substances tend to prevent this and to keep the\r\ngrains apart if flocculation has already taken place.\r\n\r\nIf two small grains of clay, suspended in water, come close together\r\nthey may be attracted to each other or not, according to the potential\r\nof the water particles on the surface of the clay. If the potential of\r\nthe surface particle of water is less than that of the particle in the\r\ninterior of the mass of liquid, there will be surface tension, and the\r\ntwo grains will come together and be held with some force, as their\r\nclose contact will diminish the number of surface particles in the\r\nliquid. If, on the other hand, the potential of the particle on the\r\nsurface of the liquid is greater than of the particle in the interior of\r\nthe mass, the water surface around the grains will tend to enlarge, as\r\nthere will be greater attraction for the water particles there than in\r\nthe interior of the mass of liquid, and the grains of clay will not come\r\nclose together and will even be held apart, as their close contact would\r\ndiminish the number of surface particles in the liquid around them.\r\n\r\n=183. Influence of Surface Tension.=—Hilgard supposes that the surface\r\ntension which is assumed to exist between two liquid surfaces must exert\r\na corresponding influence between the surfaces of solids and liquids,\r\napart from any meniscal action.\r\n\r\nIt is then to be expected that the adhesion of the particles\r\nconstituting one of these floccules will be very materially increased\r\nwhenever the formation of menisci between them becomes possible by the\r\nremoval of the general liquid mass. Suppose one of the floccules to be\r\nstranded, it will, in the first place, remain immersed in a sensibly\r\nspherical drop of liquid. As this liquid evaporates, the spherical\r\nsurface will become pitted with menisci forming between the single\r\nprojecting particles, and as these menisci diminish their radius by\r\nstill further evaporation, the force with which they hold the particles\r\ntogether will increase until it reaches a maximum. As the evaporation\r\nprogresses beyond this point of maximum, the adhesion of the constituent\r\nparticles must diminish by reason of the disappearance of the smaller\r\nmenisci, and when finally the point is reached when liquid water ceases\r\nto exist between the surfaces, the slightest touch, or sometimes even\r\nthe weight of the particles themselves, will cause a complete\r\ndissolution of the floccule, which then flattens down into a pile of\r\nsingle granules.\r\n\r\nIn regard to natural deposits from water, Hilgard supposes that they are\r\nalways precipitated in a flocculated state. The particles of less than\r\ntwo-tenths millimeter diameter are carried down with those of a larger\r\ndiameter having much higher hydraulic value. Thus the deposition of a\r\npure clay can take place under only very exceptionable circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhitney, on the other hand, suggests that grains of sand and clay carry\r\ndown mechanically the particles of fine silt and clay as they settle in\r\na turbid liquid in a beaker; and it is often difficult to wash out a\r\ntrace of fine material from a large amount of coarse particles, for this\r\nreason, although there may be no trace whatever of flocculation.\r\n\r\n=184. Destruction of Floccules.=—The destruction of the natural\r\nfloccules is seen in the ordinary process of puddling earth or clay. It\r\nis also the result of violent agitation of water or of kneading or\r\nboiling, or, finally, to a certain extent, of freezing. All these\r\nagencies are employed by the workers in clay for the purpose of\r\nincreasing the plasticity which depends essentially upon the finest\r\npossible condition of the material to be worked. As an illustration of\r\nthis, Hilgard cites the fact that any clay or soil which is worked into\r\na plastic paste with water, and dried, will form a mass of almost stony\r\nhardness. If, however, to such a substance one-half per cent of caustic\r\nlime be added, a substance which possesses in an eminent degree the\r\nproperty of coagulating clay, the diminution of plasticity will be\r\nobvious at once, even when in a wet condition. If now the mass be dried,\r\nas in the previous case, it is easily pulverized. This is an\r\nillustration of the effect of lime upon stiff lands, rendering them more\r\nreadily pulverulent and tillable. The conversion of the lime into a\r\ncarbonate in the above experiment by passing bubbles of carbonic acid\r\nthrough the mass while still suspended in water does not restore the\r\noriginal plasticity, thus illustrating experimentally the fact known to\r\nall farmers that the effect of lime on stiff soil lasts for many years,\r\nalthough the whole of the lime in that time has been converted into\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\n=185. Practical Applications.=—The practical application of this is,\r\naccording to Hilgard, that the loosely flocculated aggregation of the\r\nsoil particles is what constitutes good tilth. For this reason the\r\nperfect rest of a soil, if it is protected from the tamping influence of\r\nrains and the tramping of cattle, may produce a condition of tilth which\r\ncannot be secured by any mechanical cultivation. As an illustration of\r\nthis, the pulverulent condition of virgin soils protected in a forest by\r\nthe heavy coating of leaves may be cited. On the contrary, as pointed\r\nout by Hilgard, there are some kinds of soil in which a condition of\r\nrest may produce the same effect as tamping. These are soils which\r\nconsist of siliceous silt without enough clay to maintain them in\r\nposition after drying. In such a case, the masses of floccules collapse\r\nby their own weight or by the least shaking, and fall closely together,\r\nproducing an impaction of the soil. This takes place in some river\r\nsediment soils in which the curious phenomenon is presented of injurious\r\neffects produced by plowing when too dry, which is the direct opposite\r\nof soils containing a sufficient amount of clay and which are injured by\r\nplowing too wet.\r\n\r\nIt is further observed that the longer a soil has been maintained in\r\ngood tilth, the less it is injured by wet plowing. This is doubtless,\r\naccording to Hilgard, due to the gradual cementation of the floccules by\r\nthe soil water which fixes them more or less permanently.\r\n\r\nWhitney believes that the arrangement of the grains, or the condition of\r\nflocculation in the soil, or the distance apart of the soil grains, is\r\ndetermined, to a large extent, by the potential on the surface of the\r\ngrains; and he suggests that by changing this the exceedingly fine\r\ngrains of silt and clay can be pulled together or can be pushed further\r\napart, and so alter the whole texture of the land.\r\n\r\nThe action of alkaline carbonates in preventing flocculation, and thus\r\nrendering tillage difficult or impossible, is pointed out by Hilgard in\r\nthe case of certain alkali soils of California. The soils which are\r\nimpregnated with alkaline carbonates are recognized by their extreme\r\ncompactness. The suggestion of Hilgard to use gypsum on such soils has\r\nbeen followed by the happiest results. This gypsum renders any\r\nphosphates present insoluble, and thus prevents loss by drainage, and\r\nyet leaves the plant food in a sufficiently fine state as to be\r\nperfectly available for vegetation.\r\n\r\n=186. Suspension of Clay in Water.=—The suspension of clay in water and\r\nthe methods of producing or retarding flocculation and precipitation\r\nhave also been studied by Durham.[124] His experiment is made as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nIn a number of tall glass jars fine clay is stirred with water, and the\r\nresults of precipitation watched. In all cases it will be noticed that\r\nthe clay rapidly separates into two portions, the greater part quickly\r\nsettling down to the bottom of the jars, and the smaller part remaining\r\nsuspended for a greater or less length of time.\r\n\r\nThe power which water possesses of sustaining clay is gradually\r\ndestroyed by the addition of an acid or salt; a very small quantity, for\r\ninstance, of sulfuric acid, is sufficient to precipitate the clay with\r\ngreat rapidity. In solutions of sulfuric acid and sodium chlorid of\r\nvarying strengths, suspended clay is precipitated in the order of the\r\nspecific gravity of the solutions, the densest solutions being the last\r\nto clear up. This may be due to the greater viscosity of the denser\r\nliquids.\r\n\r\nThe power which water possesses of sustaining clay is gradually\r\ndecreased by the addition of small quantities of certain salts and of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n=187. Effect of Chemical Action=—Brewer[125] emphasizes the importance\r\nof chemical action in the flocculation of clays. As expressed by him the\r\nchemical aspects of the phenomena of sedimentation have either been\r\nlightly considered or entirely ignored. Brewer is led to believe that\r\nthe action of clay thus suspended is analogous to that of a colloidal\r\nbody. Like a colloid, when diffused in water, the bulk of the mass is\r\nvery great, shrinking enormously on drying. He therefore concludes that\r\nclays probably exist in suspension as a series of hydrous silicates\r\nfeebly holding different proportions of water in combination and having\r\ndifferent properties so far as their behavior to water is concerned.\r\n\r\nSome of them he supposes swell up in water much as boiled starch does,\r\nand are diffusible in it with different degrees of facility, and that\r\nthe strata observed on long standing of jars of suspended clay represent\r\ndifferent members of this series of chemical compounds which hold their\r\ndifferent proportions of combined water very feebly and are stable under\r\na very limited range of conditions.\r\n\r\nThese compounds are probably destroyed or changed in the presence of\r\nacids, salts and various other substances, and are stable only under\r\ncertain conditions of temperature, those which exist at one temperature\r\nbeing destroyed or changed to other compounds at a different\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n=188. Theory of Barus.=—Brewer’s hypothesis, however, is not in harmony\r\nwith the demonstration of Barus, who proves that a given particle of\r\nclay has the same density in ether as in water.\r\n\r\nThe physical and mathematical aspects of sedimentation have also been\r\ncarefully studied by Barus.[126] The mathematical conditions of a fine\r\nparticle suspended in a liquid and free from the influences of\r\nflocculation are described by Barus in the following equations.\r\n\r\nIf P be the resistance encountered by a solid spherule of radius r,\r\nmoving through a viscous liquid at the rate x, and if k be the\r\nfrictional coefficient, then P = 6πkrx. Again, the effective part of the\r\nweight of the particle is P´ = ⁴⁄₃πr³ (ρ-ρ´)g, where g is the\r\nacceleration of gravity and ρ and ρ´ the density of solid particle and\r\nliquid, respectively. In case of uniform motion P = P´. Hence x = 2/9kr²\r\n(ρ-ρ´)g ... (1).\r\n\r\nIn any given case of thoroughly triturated material the particles vary\r\nin size from a very small to a relatively large value; but by far the\r\ngreater number approach a certain mean figure and dimension. An example\r\nof this condition of things may be formulated. To avoid mathematical\r\nentanglement let y = Ax^{³⁄₂}e^{-x²} ... (2) where y is the probable\r\noccurrence of the rate of subsidence x. If now the turbidity of the\r\nliquid (avoiding optical considerations) be defined as proportional to\r\nthe mass of solid material particles suspended in unit of volume of\r\nliquid, then the degree of turbidity which the given ydx particles add\r\nto the liquid is, _caeteris paribus_, proportional to r³ydx, where r is\r\nthe mean radius. Hence the turbidity, T, at the outset of the experiment\r\n(immediately after shaking), is T = T₀∫₀^∞r³ydx = T₀, where equations\r\n(1) and (2) have been incorporated.\r\n\r\nIf the plane at a depth d below the surface of the liquid be regarded,\r\nthen at a time after shaking the residual turbidity is\r\n\r\n  (3) ... T_{d} = T₀∫^{d/t}₀r³ydx = T₀(1 − (1 + (d²/t² × e^{-d²/t²}))\r\n\r\nThe equation describes the observed occurrences fairly well.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of stratification observed by Brewer are explained by\r\nBarus from the above formula: In proportion as the time of subsidence is\r\ngreater, the tube shows opacity at the bottom, shading off gradually\r\nupward, through translucency, into clearness at the top. If, instead of\r\nequation (2), there be introduced the condition of a more abrupt\r\nmaximum, if, in other words, the particles be very nearly of the same\r\nsize, then subsidence must take place in unbroken column capped by a\r\nplane surface which at the time zero coincided with the free surface of\r\nthe liquid. Again, suppose one-half of the particles of this column\r\ndiffer in some way uniformly from the other half. Then at the outset\r\nthere are two continuous columns coinciding, or, as it were,\r\ninterpenetrating throughout their extent. But the rate of subsidence of\r\nthese two columns is necessarily different, since the particles, each\r\nfor each, differ in density, radius and frictional qualities, by given\r\nfixed amounts. Hence the two surfaces of demarcation at the time zero\r\ncoincided with the free surface. In general, if there be n groups of\r\nparticles uniformly distributed, then at the time zero n continuous\r\ncolumns interpenetrate and coincide throughout their extent. At the time\r\nt, the free surface will be represented by n consecutive surfaces of\r\ndemarcation below it, each of which caps a column, the particles of\r\nwhich form a distinct group.\r\n\r\nFrom a further discussion of the mathematical condition under which the\r\nsubsidence of the particles takes place, Barus is of the opinion that\r\nDurham’s theory of suspension being only a lower limit of solution is\r\nrapidly gaining ground, yet without being attended with concise\r\nexperimental evidence which will account for the differences in the rate\r\nof subsidence. On the contrary, Brewer’s hypothesis of colloidal\r\nhydrates is more easily subjected to experimental proof. The test shows\r\nthat the particles retain their normal density, no matter how they are\r\nsuspended or circumstanced.\r\n\r\nFurther, in the explanation of the phenomenon of sedimentation, the\r\nfollowing principle may be regarded as determined; namely, if particles\r\nof a comminuted solid are shaken up in a liquid, the distribution of\r\nparts after shaking will tend to take place in such a way that the\r\npotential energy of the system of solid particles and liquid, at every\r\nstage of subsidence, is the minimum compatible with the given\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAccording to Barus it is necessary, in order to pass judgment on the\r\nvalidity of any of the given hypotheses, to have in hand better\r\nstatistics of the size of the particles relatively to the water\r\nmolecule, than are now available. Inasmuch as the particles in pure\r\nwater are individualized and granular, it is apparently at once\r\npermissible to infer the size of the particles from the observed rates\r\nof subsidence. His observations show that the said rate decreases in\r\nmarked degree with the turbidity of the mixture. Hence the known formulæ\r\nfor single particles are not rigorously applicable, though it cannot be\r\nasserted whether the cause of discrepancy is physical or mathematical in\r\nkind. It follows that special deductions must be made for the subsidence\r\nof stated groups of particles before an estimate of their mean size can\r\nfairly be obtained.\r\n\r\nRowland[127] reaches a closer approximation for the fall of a single\r\nparticle by showing that the liquid, even at a large distance from the\r\nparticle, is not at rest.\r\n\r\nIn the case of water, however, it is noticed that despite the large\r\nsurface energy of the liquid, subsidence takes place in such a way that\r\nfor a given mass of suspended sediment the surfaces of separation are a\r\nmaximum. On the other hand, in case of subsidence in ether or in salt\r\nsolutions, the solid particles behave much like the capillary spherules\r\nof a heavy liquid shaken up in a lighter liquid with which it does not\r\nmix. In other words, the tendency here is to reduce surfaces of\r\nseparation to the least possible value, large particles growing in mass\r\nand bulk mechanically at the expense of smaller particles; in other\r\nwords, exhibiting the phenomenon of flocculation.\r\n\r\n=189. Physical Explanation of Subsidence.=—Whitney[128] thinks that the\r\nphenomena of the suspension of clay in water may be explained on purely\r\nphysical principles, and that neither the partial solution nor hydration\r\nhypotheses are necessary, or will explain the suspension of clay in\r\nwater, for the solution, or hydrated substance, would still have a\r\nhigher specific gravity than the surrounding liquid. He calls attention\r\nin the first place to the fact, that in a turbid liquid, which has been\r\nstanding for weeks and which is only faintly opalescent, the grains in\r\nsuspension are still of measurable size, if properly stained as in\r\nbacteriological examinations and viewed through an oil emersion\r\nobjective. He gives a value of 0.0001 millimeter, as the lower limit of\r\nthe diameters of these particles of “clay,” which are usually met with\r\nin agricultural soils. He refers to the fact that fine dust and ashes,\r\nand even filings of metals, may remain in suspension in the air for days\r\nand even months in very apparent clouds, or haze, although they may be a\r\nthousand times heavier than the surrounding air. Particles of clay, no\r\nsmaller than the limits which have been assigned, should remain in\r\nsuspension in the much heavier fluid, water, for an indefinite time, for\r\nthe volume or weight of the particles (⁴⁄₃)(πr³) decreases so much more\r\nrapidly in proportion than the surface (4πr²), that there is,\r\nrelatively, a larger amount of surface area in these fine clay\r\nparticles, and a great deal of surface friction in their movement\r\nthrough a medium, and they would settle very slowly. Under ordinary\r\nconditions, however, the mean daily range of temperature is about twenty\r\ndegrees, the mean monthly range is fifty degrees, and the yearly range\r\n100° F., and the ordinary convection currents, induced by the normal\r\nchange of temperature, would be sufficient of itself to keep these fine\r\nparticles in suspension in the liquid for an indefinite time, as it is\r\nknown that currents of air keep fine particles of dust and ashes in\r\nsuspension. If the volume or weight of a fine gravel, having a diameter\r\nof one and five-tenth millimeters, be taken as unity, then for a\r\nparticle, having a diameter of 0.00255 millimeter, which is the mean\r\ndiameter for Whitney’s clay group, the volume decreases in the ratio\r\n1:0.000000004853, and the surface decreases only in the ratio\r\n1:0.000286.\r\n\r\n=190. Practical Applications.=—The action of mineral substances in\r\npromoting flocculence has been taken advantage of in later times in the\r\nconstruction of filters for purifying waters holding silt in solution.\r\nIn these filters the introduction of a small quantity of alum, or some\r\nsimilar substance, into the water usually precedes the mechanical\r\nseparation of the flocculent material. In the same way the action of\r\niron and other salts on sewage waters has been made use of in their\r\npurification and in the collection of the sewage material for\r\nfertilizing purposes.\r\n\r\n=191. Separation of the Soil Into Particles of Standard Size.=—The\r\nagronomic value of a soil depends largely on the relative size of the\r\nparticles composing it. The finer the particles, within a certain limit,\r\nthe better the soil. The size of the particles may be estimated in three\r\nways: (1) by passing through sieves of different degrees of fineness;\r\n(2) by allowing them to subside for a given time in water at rest; (3)\r\nby separating them in water moving at a given rate of speed. The first\r\nmethod is a crude one and is used to prepare in a rough way, the\r\nmaterial for the second and third processes.\r\n\r\n=192. Separation in a Sieve.=—The soil should be dry enough to avoid\r\nsticking to the fingers or to prevent agglutination into masses when\r\nsubjected to pressure. It should not, however, be too dry to prevent the\r\neasy separation of any agglutinated particles under the pressure of the\r\nthumb or of a rubber pestle.\r\n\r\nThe sieve should have circular holes punched in a sheet of metal of\r\nconvenient thickness to give it the requisite degree of strength. Sieves\r\nmade of wire gauze are not so desirable but it is difficult to get the\r\nfiner meshes as circular perforations. Such sieves cannot give a uniform\r\nproduct on account of the greater diagonal diameter of the meshes and\r\nthe ease with which the separating wires can be displaced. It is\r\nconvenient to have the sieves arranged _en batterie_; say in sets of\r\nthree. Such a set should have the holes in the three sieves of the\r\nfollowing dimensions; _viz._,\r\n\r\n                  1st sieve   2 millimeters diameter.\r\n                  2nd   „     1 millimeter      „\r\n                  3rd   „   0.5      „          „\r\n\r\nCoarser single sieves may be used to separate the fragments above two\r\nmillimeters diameter if such a further classification be desired. Each\r\nsieve fits into the next finer one and the separation of a sample into\r\nthree classes of particles may be effected by a single operation. In\r\nmost cases, however, it is better to conduct each operation separately\r\nin order to promote the passage of agglutinated particles by gentle\r\npressure with the thumb or with a rubber pestle. In no case should a\r\nhard pestle be used and the pressure should never be violent enough to\r\ndisintegrate mineral particles.\r\n\r\nThere is much difference of opinion concerning the smallest size of\r\nparticles which should be obtained by the sieve.\r\n\r\nMost analytical processes prescribe particles passing a sieve of one\r\nmillimeter mesh (¹⁄₂₅ inch). There is little doubt, however, of the fact\r\nthat a finer particle would be better fitted for subsequent analysis by\r\nthe hydraulic method.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose a sieve of 0.5 millimeter circular mesh is preferred.\r\n\r\n=193. Sifting with Water.=—In soils where the particles adhere firmly\r\nthe sifting should be done with the help of water. In such cases the\r\nsoil is gently rubbed with a soft steple or the finger in water. It is\r\nthen transferred to the sieve or battery of sieves which are held in the\r\nwater, and rubbed through each of the sieves successively until the\r\nseparation is complete. After the filtrate has stood for a few minutes\r\nthe supernatant muddy liquor is poured off, the part remaining on the\r\nsieve is added to it and the process repeated until only clean particles\r\nlarger than 0.5 millimeter are left on the sieve. These particles can be\r\ndried and weighed and entered on the note book as sand. The filtrate\r\nshould be evaporated to dryness at a gentle temperature and when\r\nsufficiently dry be rubbed up into a homogeneous mass by a rubber\r\npestle.\r\n\r\nThe sieve recommended by the Association of Official Agricultural\r\nChemists[129] for the preparation of fine earth for chemical analysis\r\nhas circular openings ¹⁄₂₅ inch (one millimeter) in diameter.\r\n\r\nWahnschaffe[130] directs that a sieve of two millimeters mesh be used in\r\npreparing the sample for silt analysis and that the residue after the\r\nsilt analysis is finished, which has not been carried over by a velocity\r\nof twenty-five millimeters per second, be separated in sieves of one\r\nmillimeter and 0.5 millimeter meshes respectively.\r\n\r\nHilgard objects to leaving this coarse material in the sample during the\r\nprocess of churn elutriation on account of the attrition which it exerts\r\nand therefore directs that it be separated by sieve analysis before the\r\nelutriation begins.\r\n\r\n=194. Method of the German Experiment Stations.=[131]—In the method\r\nrecommended for the German Agricultural Stations an attempt is made to\r\nsecure even a finer sieve separation than that already mentioned.\r\n\r\nSieves having the following dimensions are employed; sieve No. 1, square\r\nmeshes 0.09 millimeter in size, diagonal measure 0.11 millimeter; sieve\r\nNo. 2, square meshes 0.14 to 0.17 millimeter in diameter, diagonal\r\nmeasure 0.22 to 0.24 millimeter; sieve No. 3, square meshes 0.35 to 0.39\r\nmillimeter in diameter, diagonal measure 0.45 to 0.50 millimeter;\r\nfinally a series of sieves one, two and three millimeters circular\r\nperforations.\r\n\r\nFive hundred grams of the soil (in the Halle Station only 250) are\r\nplaced in a porcelain dish with about one liter of water and allowed to\r\nstand for some time with frequent stirring, on a water bath. After about\r\ntwo hours, when the soil is sufficiently softened so that with the help\r\nof a pestle it can be washed through the sieves, the process of sifting\r\nis undertaken in the following manner: Sieve No. 3 is placed over a dish\r\ncontaining water, the moistened soil placed therein and the sieve\r\ndepressed a few centimeters under the water and the soil stirred by\r\nmeans of a pestle until particles no longer pass through. After the\r\noperation is ended the residue in the sieve is washed with pure water\r\nand dried. The part passing the sieve is thoroughly stirred and then\r\nwashed with water into sieve No. 2 and treated as before. The product\r\nobtained in this way is brought into sieve No. 1 and carefully washed.\r\nAll the products remaining on each of the sieves are dried at 100° and\r\nweighed. The portion passing sieve No. 1 is either dried with its wash\r\nwater or estimated by loss by deducting from the total weight taken, the\r\nsum of the other weights obtained. If a more perfect separation of the\r\nfirst sieve residue be desired it can be obtained by passing it through\r\nsieves of the last series which may have meshes varying in size, _viz._:\r\none, two, or three millimeters in diameter. Each sieve of the same class\r\nshould have holes uniformly of the same size.\r\n\r\nThe sieve products are characterized as follows: The part passing a\r\nthree millimeter sieve is called fine earth, while the part remaining is\r\ncalled gravel. The fine earth is separated into the following products:\r\nThe part that passes through the three millimeters opening and is left\r\nby the two millimeters opening is called _steinkies_. The product from\r\nthe two millimeters opening and the residue from the one millimeter\r\nopening is called _grobkies_. The product from the one millimeter\r\nopening and the residue on the sieve No. 3 is called _feinkies_. The\r\nproduct from the sieve No. 3 and the residue from the sieve No. 2 is\r\ncalled coarse sand. The product from sieve No. 2 and the residue from\r\nsieve No. 1 is called fine sand. The product from sieve No. 1 is called\r\ndust. The dust can be further separated into sand, dust, and clay. For\r\nthe examination of the clay the Kühn silt cylinder as modified by\r\nWagner, is recommended. The cylinder has a diameter of eight centimeters\r\nand a height of thirty centimeters, and is furnished with a movable exit\r\ntube reaching to its bottom.\r\n\r\n=195. General Classification of the Soil by Sieve Analysis.=—The\r\nclassification recommended by the German chemists is satisfactory but\r\nthe following one is more simple. All pebbles, pieces of rock, etc.,\r\nshould first be separated by a two millimeters circular mesh sieve,\r\ndried at 105° and weighed. The result should be entered as pebbles and\r\ncoarse sand.\r\n\r\nThe finer sand may be separated with a sieve of one millimeter circular\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\nThe still finer sand is next separated with the sieve of 0.5 millimeter\r\ncircular openings as indicated above.\r\n\r\nThe sample may now be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Coarse pebbles, sticks, roots, etc., separated by hand.\r\n\r\n  2. Pebbles and coarse sand not passing a two millimeters sieve.\r\n\r\n  3. Sand not passing a one millimeter sieve.\r\n\r\n  4. Fine sand not passing a 0.5 millimeter sieve.\r\n\r\n  5. Fine earth passing a 0.5 millimeter sieve.\r\n\r\n=196. Classification of Orth.=[132]—As fine silt are reckoned those\r\nparticles which range from 0.02 to 0.05 millimeter; as fine sand the\r\ngroups from 0.05 to 0.2 millimeter; as medium sized sand those ranging\r\nfrom 0.2 to 0.5 millimeter and for large grained sand those particles\r\nranging from 0.5 to 2 millimeters in diameter. Particles over two\r\nmillimeters form the last classification.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SEPARATION OF THE EARTH PARTICLES BY A LIQUID.\r\n\r\n=197. Methods of Silt Analysis.=—The further classification of the\r\nparticles of a soil passing a fine sieve can best be effected by\r\nseparation in water. The velocity with which the current moves or with\r\nwhich the particles subside will cause a separation of the particles\r\ninto varying sizes. The slower the velocity the smaller the particles\r\nwhich are separated. There is, however, a large and important\r\nconstituent of a soil which remains suspended in water, or in a state of\r\nseeming solution. This suspended matter would still be carried over by a\r\ncurrent of water moving at a rate so slow as to make a subclassification\r\nof it impossible. This suspended matter passing off at a given velocity\r\nmay be classed as clay, and it consists in fact chiefly of the hydrated\r\nsilicate of alumina, or other particles of equal fineness. The laws\r\nwhich govern its deposit have already been discussed.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus which have been used for silt analysis may be grouped into\r\nfour classes.\r\n\r\n(1) Apparatus depending on the rate of descent of the particles of a\r\nsoil through water at rest. The apparatus for decanting from a cylinder\r\nor a beaker belong to this class.\r\n\r\n(2) Apparatus which determine the rate of flow by passing the liquid\r\nthrough a vessel of conical shape. The system of Nöbel is a good\r\nillustration of this kind of apparatus.\r\n\r\n(3) Apparatus in which the elutriating vessel is cylindrical and the\r\nrate of flow determined by a stop-cock or pressure feed apparatus. The\r\nsystem of Schöne represents this type.\r\n\r\n(4) Apparatus in which the above system is combined with a device for\r\nmechanically separating the particles and bringing them in a free state\r\ninto the elutriating current. The system of Hilgard is the type of this\r\nkind of apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn practice the use of cylindrical apparatus with or without mechanical\r\nstirring and the method by decantation have proved to be the most\r\nreliable and satisfactory procedures. Between the beaker and churn\r\nmethods, of separation there is little choice in regard to accuracy.\r\nWhich is the superior method, is a question on which the opinions of\r\nexperienced analysts are divided. The various processes will be\r\ndescribed in the order already mentioned.\r\n\r\n=198. Methods Depending on Subsidence of Soil Particles.=—The simplest\r\nmethod of effecting the further separation of the soil particles is\r\nwithout doubt that process which permits them to fall freely in a liquid\r\nsensibly at rest. The practical difficulties of this method consist in\r\nthe trouble of securing a perfect separation of the particles, in\r\npreventing flocculation after division and in avoiding currents in the\r\nliquid of separation.\r\n\r\nFor the separation of the soil particles for this method boiling and wet\r\npestling are the only means employed. The flocculation of the separated\r\nparticles may be partially prevented by adding a little ammonia to the\r\nwater employed. The author has also tried dilute alcohol as the\r\nseparating liquid but the results of this method are not yet\r\nsufficiently definite to find a place in this manual. Evidently the\r\npractical impossibility of avoiding convection currents prevents the use\r\nof water at a high temperature for this separation, although the\r\ntendency to flocculation almost disappears as the temperature approaches\r\n100°. The general method of avoiding the errors due to flocculation in\r\nthe subsidence method consists in repestling the deposited particles and\r\nthus subjecting them as often as may be necessary to resedimentation.\r\nThese principles are well set forth by Osborne,[133] who states that\r\nwhen a soil is completely suspended in water by vigorous agitation,\r\nparticles of all the sizes present are to be found throughout the entire\r\nmass of liquid. When subsidence takes place, the larger particles will\r\ngo down more rapidly than the smaller ones, but some of the small\r\nparticles that are near the bottom will be deposited sooner than some of\r\nthe larger ones which have a much greater distance to travel. Thus,\r\nindependently of the fact that the larger particles in their descent are\r\nsomewhat impeded by the smaller, the smaller being at the same time\r\nsomewhat hastened by the larger, the sediment that reaches the bottom at\r\nany moment is a more or less complex mixture of all the mechanical\r\nelements of the soil. The liquid, however, above this sediment at the\r\nsame moment will have completely deposited all particles exceeding\r\ncertain dimensions of hydraulic value, determined mainly by the time of\r\nsubsidence.\r\n\r\nIf now the aforesaid first sediment be suspended in pure water, and\r\nallowed to subside for the same time as before, the larger part of it\r\nwill be again deposited, but some will remain in suspension, consisting\r\nof a considerable part of the finer matter of the first sediment. By\r\npouring off these suspended particles with the water and agitating the\r\nsediment again with clear water as before, another portion of fine\r\nparticles will be suspended and may be decanted from it. On continuing\r\nthis process of repeated decantations it will soon be found that the\r\nsoil has been separated into two grades.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in this way a separation can be made, but it is\r\nperhaps not so clear that such a separation would be sharp enough for\r\nthe purposes of a mechanical soil analysis. If, for instance, the\r\nseparation is to be made at 0.05 millimeter diameter, it is evident that\r\nby repeated decantations all below 0.01 millimeter can be washed out of\r\nthat above 0.05 millimeter, but it may not appear so probable that all\r\nbelow 0.045 millimeter can be removed without removing some above 0.055\r\nmillimeter.\r\n\r\nSuch a result may be easily attained, however, if the following\r\nprinciple be adhered to:\r\n\r\nMake the duration of the subsidence such that the liquid decanted the\r\nfirst few times shall contain nothing larger than the desired diameter.\r\nThen decant into another vessel, timing the subsidence so that the\r\nsediment shall contain nothing smaller than the chosen diameter. This\r\ncan not be done without decanting much that is larger than the chosen\r\ndiameter, but the greater part of the particles greater and less than\r\nthe chosen diameter can be removed and an intermediate product obtained,\r\nthe diameters of whose particles are not very far from that desired.\r\n\r\nIf this intermediate portion be again subjected to the same process, two\r\nfractions may be separated from it, one containing particles larger than\r\nthe chosen diameter and another containing particles smaller than this\r\ndiameter, while a new intermediate product will remain which is less in\r\namount than that resulting from the first operation. By frequent\r\nrepetitions of this process this intermediate product can be reduced to\r\na very small amount of substance the particles of which have diameters\r\nlying close to the chosen limit and may then be divided between the two\r\nfractions.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the separation described by Osborne set forth with\r\nsufficient clearness the purposes to be achieved by the analysis. The\r\nchief methods of manipulation practiced will be found below.\r\n\r\n=199. Kühn’s Silt Cylinder.=—A simple form of apparatus for the\r\ndetermination of silt by the sedimentation process is the one described\r\nby Kühn.[134]\r\n\r\nThe cylinder should be about twenty-eight centimeters high with a\r\ndiameter of 8.5 centimeters. At the lower end of the cylinder five\r\ncentimeters from the bottom it carries a tube 1.5 centimeter in diameter\r\nfurnished with a pinch-cock and held in position by a rubber stopper.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the process thirty grams of sifted soil (two millimeters\r\nmesh sieve) are boiled with water for an hour and after cooling the soil\r\nand water are washed into the separating cylinder. The cylinder is then\r\nfilled with water with constant shaking.\r\n\r\nAfter standing for ten minutes the stop-cock is opened and the water\r\nwith its suspended matter allowed to flow into a porcelain dish.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is then again filled with water and the process is\r\ncontinued until the water drawn off is practically clear.\r\n\r\nThe fine particles having been separated in this way the next coarser\r\ngrade of particles is separated by repeating the process at intervals of\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\nBy these two operations it is considered that the clay is entirely\r\nremoved. The residue remaining in the cylinder is dried and weighed. The\r\nrelative proportions of clay and residue in the sample are thus\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe residue is then separated into two portions by sieves of one\r\nmillimeter and 0.5 millimeter mesh.\r\n\r\nThe soil is thus separated into the following parts:\r\n\r\n  1. By the first sifting coarse quartz larger than two millimeters\r\n       diameter.\r\n\r\n  2. Fine quartz two millimeters, to one millimeter diameter.\r\n\r\n  3. Coarse sand one millimeter, to 0.5 millimeter diameter.\r\n\r\n  4. Fine sand finer than 0.5 millimeter diameter.\r\n\r\n  5. Silt, clay, humus, etc., separated by the water.\r\n\r\n=200. Knop’s Silt Cylinder.=—The cylinder recommended by Knop[135] is\r\nessentially that of Kühn being furnished with four lateral tubes instead\r\nof one (Fig. 25).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 25.\r\n\r\n  KNOP’S SILT CYLINDER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sample of soil, twenty-five to thirty grams, after passing a two\r\nmillimeters mesh sieve, and long boiling, is washed through a series of\r\nsieves of the following diameters of mesh respectively; _viz._, one\r\nmillimeter, 0.5 millimeter, 0.25 millimeter, and 0.1 millimeter. The\r\npart which passes the finest sieve is placed in a Knop’s cylinder, the\r\ncylinder filled with water one decimeter above upper tube and well\r\nshaken. The cylinder is allowed to rest for five minutes when the upper\r\ncock is opened and the water drawn off. After five minutes more the next\r\ntube is opened and so on with equal intervals for the three upper tubes.\r\nThe operation is repeated with fresh water until the water drawn off is\r\nclear. Finally the lowest tube is opened and all the water poured off of\r\nthe sandy residue. The space between each tube is one decimeter. The\r\ndust remaining is dried and weighed and the weight of material carried\r\nover as silt determined by difference.\r\n\r\n=201. Siphon Silt Cylinder.=—Instead of the tubulated cylinder one\r\nfurnished with a siphon can be employed[136] (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\nIt should be about forty centimeters high and six centimeters internal\r\ndiameter. The cylinder first receives twenty-five to thirty grams of the\r\nwell boiled fine earth and then water until there is but a small space\r\nbetween it and the stopper when the latter is inserted.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is marked exactly 200 millimeters below the surface of the\r\nwater with a narrow strip of paper at _a_, stoppered, inverted and well\r\nshaken. The cylinder being again placed in normal position the soil\r\nparticles under the influence of gravity tend to sink with greater or\r\nless rapidity according to their size. The siphon _a b c_ is filled with\r\nwater, the cock at _c_ closed and the opened end _a_ placed in the\r\ncylinder A just at the mark 200 millimeters below the surface of the\r\nwater, and the water thus transferred to B when desired. If the\r\nsuspended matter is allowed to stand for 100 seconds the particles of\r\nmore than two millimeters hydraulic value will have fallen below the\r\nopen end of the siphon. If allowed to stand 1,000 seconds the silt value\r\nof the particles will be 0.2 millimeter per second. Whatever the number\r\nof seconds may be, the operation is continued until the water removed is\r\npractically clear. The open end of the siphon _a_ should be bent upwards\r\nso that no disturbing current may bring the particles below the line\r\ninto the liquid discharged into B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 26.\r\n\r\n  SIPHON CYLINDER FOR SILT ANALYSIS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile the results obtained by this method are satisfactory as compared\r\nwith other similar processes it cannot be highly recommended because of\r\nthe time and trouble required to get a complete separation and by reason\r\nof the difficulty of collecting the separated silt.\r\n\r\n=202. Wolff’s Method.=[137]—As modified by Wolff the Knop process is\r\nconducted as follows: Fifty grams of fine earth are boiled with water\r\nand then the entire mixture is passed through three sieves with openings\r\nof one millimeter, 0.5 millimeter, and 0.25 millimeter in diameter,\r\nrespectively. The finest part is mixed with water to a height of\r\neighteen centimeters in a bottle twenty centimeters high and having a\r\ncapacity of one liter and thoroughly agitated, after which it is left to\r\nrest, and finally the turbid liquid is drawn off with a siphon, the\r\nbottle refilled with water, agitated, and left to rest, and the process\r\nrepeated as long as the water carries any suspended matter after a\r\ndefinite time.\r\n\r\nWolff proposes for the first three periods of rest one hour, for the\r\nsecond three, a half an hour, for the third three, a quarter of an hour,\r\nand for the fourth three, five minutes.\r\n\r\n=203. Moore’s Modification of Knop’s Method.=[138]—The sample of soil is\r\nfirst passed through a sieve having round perforations three millimeters\r\nin diameter. The weight of the particles remaining on the sieve is then\r\ndetermined, and likewise that of the portion passing through, which is\r\nknown as fine earth. The last named portion constitutes the material for\r\nall subsequent operations of mechanical and chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nThirty grams of the fine earth are boiled rapidly with water until the\r\nlumps are disintegrated and clayey portions separated from the sand. The\r\nmaterial is then successively washed through perforated metal sieves,\r\nthe holes of which are respectively 1, 0.5, and 0.25 millimeter in\r\ndiameter. The portions retained on the sieves are severally dried,\r\nignited and weighed, and the finest portion, or that passing through the\r\n0.25 millimeter sieve, is then submitted to the following process of\r\nseparation:\r\n\r\nThe sediment and water passing through the 0.25 millimeter sieve are\r\nplaced in a glass cylinder fifty centimeters long and thirty-seven\r\nmillimeters in internal diameter. The cylinder is closed at the bottom\r\nand is provided with a lateral tube inserted six centimeters above the\r\nbottom. Three other lateral tubes are inserted at intervals of ten\r\ncentimeters above the first tube, and a ring is etched into the cylinder\r\nten centimeters above the uppermost tube. The lateral tubes are closed\r\nwith rubber tubes compressed by spring clips. The sediment being placed\r\nin the cylinder, water is added to the mark or ring, the cylinder closed\r\nwith a rubber stopper, and vigorously shaken until the contents are\r\nthoroughly mixed. It is then placed upright, the stopper removed, and\r\nafter standing undisturbed for five minutes the clip on the uppermost\r\ntube is opened and the water allowed to flow into a beaker. After five\r\nminutes further standing, the second clip is opened and the water drawn\r\noff into the same beaker; in the same manner the water is drawn off from\r\nthe other tubes at intervals of five minutes until the level of the\r\nlowest tube is reached. The cylinder is then refilled with water to the\r\nmark, thoroughly shaken after inserting the stopper and the water again\r\ndrawn off at intervals of five minutes, as before; the operation being\r\nrepeated until the water drawn off is almost free from turbidity. The\r\nsediment remaining in the cylinder from this process of washing by\r\nsubsidence is termed by Knop, fine sand, the material flowing off in\r\nsuspension in the wash waters, dust, and the process of separation by\r\nKnop’s original method ends here.\r\n\r\nIn order to remedy the imperfect separation into definite particles\r\nsecured by the above method, Moore proposes the following device:\r\n\r\nThe fine sand from the first series of subsidences is placed in a\r\nseparate vessel, the washings are allowed to remain undisturbed for\r\ntwelve hours, the turbid liquid decanted and the sediment returned to\r\nthe cylinder. Water is then added to the mark, the whole shaken, and the\r\nliquid drawn off at intervals of five minutes, as in the first series.\r\nThe sediment from this operation is placed in a separate beaker, the\r\nwashings returned to the cylinder, and again allowed to subside as\r\nbefore; the sediment from this second subsidence is added to that from\r\nthe preceding operation, and the washings again returned to the\r\ncylinder, the operation being repeated as long as any sediment can be\r\nobtained from renewed treatment of the washings; the final washings are\r\nthen placed in a separate vessel for subsequent microscopic\r\nmeasurements.\r\n\r\nThe collective sediments from the last series of operations are then\r\nreturned to the cylinder and allowed to subside with fresh additions of\r\nwater, as in the case of the first series; the fine sand thus obtained\r\nbeing added to that from the first series, and the washings being\r\ncollected in a large beaker. The latter are left at rest for twelve\r\nhours, and the sediment returned to the cylinder and treated as before\r\nuntil no further separation can be effected. The fine sand resulting\r\nfrom all of these operations is then dried, ignited and weighed; the\r\nweight of the portion removed by the washing being determined by\r\ndifference, as it is, owing to its excessively slow rate of subsidence,\r\nfound impracticable to collect it for direct weighing. The size of the\r\nparticles of fine sand is then determined by micrometric measurement.\r\nSimilar measurements are made on the material obtained by long\r\nsubsidence from the washings from the foregoing operations. The average\r\ndiameter of the largest particles should not exceed 0.01 millimeter.\r\n\r\n=204. Statement of Results.=—The results of the analyses on three soils\r\nfrom the localities indicated in the table, and the method of stating\r\nthem, are given in the following table:\r\n\r\n                                  New Milford, Clarksville,  Granville,\r\n                                   Conn., per   Tenn., per   N. C., per\r\n                                     cent.        cent.        cent.\r\n Particles larger in diameter             8.55         0.32         0.23\r\n   than 3.0 millimeters\r\n Particles of diameter from 3.0           4.96         0.45        15.04\r\n   millimeters to 1.0 millimeter\r\n Particles of diameter from 1.0           4.43         0.96        33.43\r\n   millimeter to 0.5 millimeter\r\n Particles of diameter from 0.5          11.86         1.25        18.82\r\n   millimeter to 0.25 millimeter\r\n Particles of diameter from 0.25         60.54        61.58        23.59\r\n   millimeter to 0.01 millimeter\r\n Particles smaller in diameter            9.66        35.44         8.89\r\n   than 0.01 millimeter\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n              Total                     100.00       100.00       100.00\r\n\r\n=205. Method of Bennigsen.=—The silt flasks recommended by\r\nBennigsen[139] are shown in Fig. 27.\r\n\r\nThe glass flask _b_ carries a long cylindrical neck _a_ the upper part\r\nof which is graduated in cubic centimeters. Ten grams of the fine soil\r\nare shaken with water in the flask, the neck of which is closed with a\r\nrubber stopper. The flask is then inverted bringing the soil and water\r\ninto the neck. The flask is hung up and sedimentation is assisted by\r\nimparting a pendulous motion to the neck for ten minutes. After an hour\r\nthe soil particles have separated into a coarse layer below and a fine\r\nlayer above. The relative volumes of the two layers are then read off in\r\ncubic centimeters. While this method may be useful in helping to form a\r\nspeedy judgment concerning the character of a soil it can lay no claim\r\nto being an accurate method of silt separation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 27.\r\n\r\n  BENNIGSEN’S SILT FLASKS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=206. Method of Gasparin.=—The method of Gasparin only gives a very\r\nprimitive separation of the various components of the earth according to\r\ntheir fineness. It is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nTen grams of sifted earth are put into a beaker, water is added and\r\nstrongly agitated; after five minutes the water is decanted into another\r\nvessel, the first vessel is filled anew with water, agitated, decanted,\r\nand this process is repeated until the liquid remains perfectly clear.\r\nOnly two portions are weighed, _i. e._, the pebbles which remain in the\r\nsieve and the coarse sand which remains in the beaker; while the\r\nargillaceous portion drawn off with the water is determined by the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n=207. The Italian Method.=—The following modification of Gasparin’s\r\nprocess is practiced by the Italian chemists:[140]\r\n\r\nTwenty grams of earth are passed through a sieve having openings of one\r\nmillimeter in diameter, then the sifted part is mixed with 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water in a 200 cubic centimeters beaker and left to rest\r\nfor some hours, then strongly agitated and after ten seconds the turbid\r\nliquid is poured into another vessel of half a liter capacity. This\r\nmanipulation is repeated until the liquid is clear.\r\n\r\nThe decanted liquid is thoroughly agitated, then left to stand until the\r\nmovement shall be completely arrested, after which the supernatant\r\nliquid is poured into another vessel holding two liters. To the residuum\r\nis added more water; it is agitated, decanted, and this process is\r\nrepeated until the water is no longer turbid.\r\n\r\n=208. Method of Osborne.=—In the foregoing paragraphs the methods of\r\nsilt separation by subsidence as practiced in different countries have\r\nbeen outlined. The good points of the various methods are combined in\r\nthe process as carried out by Osborne.[141] The details of this method\r\nwill be given with sufficient minuteness to make its practice possible\r\nby all analysts.\r\n\r\n_Selecting the Sample._—Several pounds of air-dried, fine earth are\r\nsecured by passing the soil through a sieve, the holes of which are\r\nthree millimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\n_Sifting._—Thirty grams of the above fine earth are stirred with 300 to\r\n400 cubic centimeters of water and then thrown successively upon sieves\r\nwith circular holes of 1, 0.5, and 0.25 millimeter diameter\r\nrespectively. By means of successive additions of water and the use of a\r\ncamel’s hair brush, all the fine material is made to pass through the\r\nsieves and these at the last are agitated under water in a shallow dish\r\nin such a way that the soil is immersed. The finest sieve should be well\r\nwet with water on its lower surface just before using. The finest\r\nparticles which render the water turbid are easily washed through. The\r\nturbid water is kept separated from the clear water which comes off with\r\nthe last portions that pass the sieves. The turbid water usually does\r\nnot amount to more than one liter.\r\n\r\n_Elutriation._—The elutriation should be carried on so as to secure\r\nthree grades of silt; the diameters of the particles ranging in the\r\nfirst grades from 0.25 to 0.05 millimeter, in the second grade from 0.05\r\nto 0.01 millimeter, and in the third grade from 0.01 millimeter to the\r\nimpalpable powder. The term sand is applied to the first grade, silt to\r\nthe second, and dust to the third. After the turbid liquid from the\r\nsifting has stood a short time it is decanted from the sediment and\r\nafter standing until a slight deposit is formed, is again decanted and\r\nthe sediment examined with a microscope. If sand be present, the\r\nsubsidence of the turbid liquid is continued until no more sand is\r\ndeposited. As the sand subsides rapidly there is no difficulty in\r\naltogether freeing the liquid first decanted from this grade of\r\nparticles. The sediment thus obtained contains all the sand, a part of\r\nthe dust and much silt. As only dust and the finest silt render the\r\nwater turbid the sediment is stirred a few times with a fresh quantity\r\nof water and decanted after standing long enough to let all the sand\r\nsettle. When the water decanted is free from turbidity, the last\r\nportions of the soil passing through the sieve with clear water are\r\nadded to the sediment and the decantations continued so as to remove\r\nmost of the silt. When no more silt can be easily removed from the\r\nsediment without decanting sand, the decantations are made into a\r\ndifferent vessel and the subsidences so timed as to remove as much of\r\nthe silt as possible. By using a little care, at least three-quarters of\r\nthe sand are thus obtained free from silt. The rest of the sand is mixed\r\nwith the greater part of the silt which has been decanted into the\r\nsecond vessel. The size of the smallest particles in this vessel is\r\ndetermined with the microscope, to make sure that its contents are free\r\nfrom dust as they usually will be if, after settling for a few moments,\r\nthey leave the water free from turbidity.\r\n\r\nThe soil is thus separated into three portions, one containing sand, one\r\nsand and silt, and the other silt, dust, and clay. The sand and silt are\r\nseparated from each other by repeating the subsidences and decantations\r\nin the manner just described.\r\n\r\nIn this way there is removed from the sediment, on the one hand, a\r\nportion of silt free from sand and dust, and on the other hand a portion\r\nof sand free from silt. Thus is obtained a second intermediate portion\r\nconsisting of sand and silt, but less in amount than the first and\r\ncontaining particles of diameters much more nearly approaching 0.05\r\nmillimeter. By repeating this process a few times, this intermediate\r\nportion will be reduced to particles whose diameters are very near 0.05\r\nmillimeter and which may be divided between sand and silt, according to\r\njudgment. The amount of this is usually very small. As soon as portions\r\nare separated, which the microscope shows to be pure sand or pure silt,\r\nthey are added to the chief portions of these grades already obtained.\r\n\r\nThe same process is applied to the separation of silt from dust. When\r\nall the silt has been removed from the dust and clay, the turbid water\r\ncontaining the dust and clay is set aside and allowed to settle in a\r\ncylindrical vessel for twenty-four hours. The vessel is filled to a\r\nheight of 200 millimeters. According to Hilgard, the separation of the\r\ndust from clay during a subsidence of twenty-four hours, will give\r\nresults of sufficient accuracy, although the clay then remaining\r\nsuspended will not be entirely free from measurable fine particles up to\r\n0.001 or 0.002 millimeter diameter.\r\n\r\nSmall beakers and small quantities of distilled water are used at first\r\nfor the decantations, as thus the duration of subsidence is less and\r\nmore decantations can be made in a given time than when larger\r\nquantities of water are employed. Beakers of about 100 cubic centimeters\r\ncapacity are convenient for the coarser grades, but it is necessary to\r\nuse larger vessels for the fine sediments from which turbid water\r\naccumulates that cannot be thrown away, as may be done with the clear\r\nwater, from which the coarse sediments settle out completely in a short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt is best to keep the amount of water as small as possible in working\r\nout the dust since loss is incurred in using too large quantities.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary in most cases to subject the various fractions\r\nobtained during elutriation, to careful kneading with a soft rubber\r\npestle so that the fine lumps of clay may be broken up and caused to\r\nremain suspended in the water. This treatment with the pestle should be\r\ndone in such a way as to avoid as far as possible all grinding of the\r\nparticles, the object being merely to pulverize the minute aggregations\r\nof clay and extremely fine particles which always form on drying a\r\nsample of soil after removing it from the ground.\r\n\r\n_Measurement of the Particles._—To determine the size of particles in\r\nsuspension, a small glass tube is applied to the surface of the liquid\r\nin such a way as to take up a single drop which is transferred to a\r\nglass slide. This drop will contain the smallest particles in the\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a sample of the coarsest particles the liquid is allowed to\r\nstand long enough to form a very slight sediment and a portion of this\r\nsediment is collected with a glass tube.\r\n\r\nTo determine the diameter of the particles in a sediment it is stirred\r\nvigorously with a little water and the pipette at once applied to the\r\nsurface of the water. On decanting the greater part of the sediment, the\r\nlarge particles remain at the bottom of the beaker and may be easily\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n_Time._—The time required to make the separations, above described, is\r\nabout two hours for each, so that an analysis including the sittings, is\r\nmade in five or six hours, exclusive of the time necessary for\r\ncollecting the dust and separating the clay, for which a subsidence of\r\ntwenty-four hours is allowed.\r\n\r\n_Weighing the Sediments._—The sediments are prepared for weighing by\r\nallowing them to subside completely, decanting the clear water as far as\r\npossible, rinsing them into a weighed platinum dish and igniting. The\r\ndish is cooled in a desiccator.\r\n\r\n_Effect of Boiling._—The analyses show a very decided increase in the\r\nparticles smaller than 0.01 millimeter diameter at the expense of\r\ncoarser particles as the result of boiling. The surfaces of the coarser\r\nparticles are seen to be polished and of a lighter color than those not\r\nboiled. The surfaces of the unboiled particles are coated with a film of\r\nfine material probably cemented to them by clay. When these coarse\r\nparticles which have not been boiled, are violently stirred with water\r\nfor a short time, no fine particles are detached from them; and a\r\ncareful examination under the microscope fails to reveal in any of the\r\nsediments more than an occasional grain exceeding the 0.05 millimeter\r\nlimit by so much as 0.01 millimeter, or the 0.01 limit by as much as\r\n0.005 millimeter. It would, therefore, appear that these small particles\r\nthus set free by long boiling are really a part of the larger ones and\r\nshould be treated as such in a mechanical analysis of these soils.\r\n\r\n=209. The French Method.=—The Schloesing method[142] as practiced by the\r\nFrench agricultural chemists[143] differs essentially from those already\r\ndescribed in attempting to first free the silt from carbonates and\r\norganic matter. It is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nOne kilogram of the soil previously dried in the air, is taken and\r\npassed through a sieve of which the meshes are five millimeters. The\r\nagglomerated particles of earth are broken up by the hand. The pebbles\r\nare also taken out and weighed. The pebbles are then treated with\r\nhydrochloric acid until all effervescence is over. The insoluble part is\r\ndried and again weighed. The difference in weight gives the quantity of\r\ncalcium carbonate contained on the external surface of the pebbles. The\r\nearth which passes the sieve of five millimeters mesh is next passed\r\nthrough a sieve having ten meshes to the centimeter. The masses on the\r\nsieve are broken up with the hand or with a pestle, in such a manner as\r\nto separate the fine agglomerated particles. The material which remains\r\nupon the sieve after being dried at 100°, is weighed. This gives the\r\ncoarse sand. This is treated with hydrochloric acid as were the pebbles\r\nbefore, washed and the residue dried and weighed. The difference in\r\nweight gives the quantity of calcium carbonate adhering to the surface\r\nof the coarse sand.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical analysis is continued with the matter which has passed\r\nthe sieve with ten meshes to the centimeter and which consists of the\r\nsoil, properly so-called. Ten grams of this are taken, dried at 100°\r\nuntil no further loss takes place and the moisture thus determined.\r\nAnother ten grams are taken and placed in a capsule with a flat bottom,\r\nand from nine to ten centimeters in diameter. This is moistened with a\r\nsmall quantity of water in such a way as to make a paste. This paste is\r\nrubbed with the finger in fifteen cubic centimeters of water. Ten\r\nseconds after the stirring is completed the supernatant liquid is poured\r\ninto a precipitating jar of about 250 cubic centimeters capacity, taking\r\ngreat care not to allow any particles to pass over which have been\r\ndeposited during that time. This operation is repeated in the same way\r\nwaiting about ten seconds each time before decanting, until the decanted\r\nliquor is almost perfectly clear. In this way the particles of different\r\nfineness are separated. The decanted portions contain the fine sand and\r\nclay. The remaining portion contains the sand and particles of medium\r\nfineness. This last part is dried, being kept at 100° until it has a\r\nconstant weight. It is afterwards treated with dilute nitric acid to\r\ndissolve the calcium carbonate. When the carbonate is abundant, it is\r\nsufficient to determine it by difference which is done by washing the\r\nmaterial, drying and weighing. But when the proportion of carbonate is\r\nvery small and in consequence when its exact determination acquires a\r\ngreater importance, it is better to determine the lime directly. For\r\nthis purpose the part soluble in dilute nitric acid is collected,\r\ntreated with ammonia and acetic acid and precipitated with ammonium\r\noxalate. Details of this operation will be given in another part of this\r\nmanual.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the matter which is insoluble in nitric acid, it is\r\ncomposed chiefly of silica or silicates, and sometimes also of vegetable\r\ndébris. The vegetable matter is determined by the incineration of the\r\nmaterial which has been previously dried. The loss of weight gives the\r\nproportion of vegetable or organic débris contained in the soil and of\r\ncombined water.\r\n\r\nThe portion which has been decanted, the volume of which should not\r\nexceed 500 cubic centimeters, is treated with nitric acid until\r\neffervescence ceases. It is then left to digest for some time, in order\r\nto permit the whole of the carbonate to dissolve. It is next thrown upon\r\na smooth filter about one decimeter in diameter. After filtration it is\r\nwashed to secure the complete elimination of the soluble lime salts. The\r\nlime is determined in the filtered liquid.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble portion contains the fine sand, the clay and humus bodies.\r\nIn order to separate the three elements the precipitate which was\r\nreceived upon the filter, is rubbed with water, the filter is broken and\r\nall its contents washed through. The volume of wash water is made up to\r\n200 cubic centimeters; two or three cubic centimeters of ammonia are\r\nadded and the whole left to digest for two or three hours. The volume of\r\nthe liquid is then made up to one liter with distilled water, vigorously\r\nshaking in such a way as to put all the matter in suspension. It is then\r\nleft to settle for twenty-four hours. At the end of this time the\r\nsupernatant liquid is decanted by the aid of a siphon. To the residue\r\nare added two cubic centimeters of ammonia and one liter of water. The\r\nmatter is again brought into suspension and allowed to settle for\r\ntwenty-four hours. The supernatant liquid is again decanted with a\r\nsiphon, and added to the liquid previously removed. For ordinary soils\r\ntwo decantations are generally sufficient but when the soils contain a\r\nlarge quantity of clay it is convenient to decant three or four times.\r\nBy an examination of the supernatant liquid it is easy to tell if the\r\nwashings have been sufficiently prolonged. The decanted liquors contain\r\nthe organic matter and that which it is convenient to call clay, which\r\nis constituted of very fine particles of sand and colloidal clay which\r\nplay, in arable soil, a rôle somewhat like that of cement.\r\n\r\nThese matters are estimated in the following manner: The liquor is first\r\ntreated with nitric acid and the clay and the humic matters are\r\nprecipitated together. They are collected upon a smooth filter one\r\ndecimeter in diameter and washed with water. By means of a washing\r\nbottle all the solid matters which have stuck to the sides of the filter\r\nare finally collected in the bottom of it. Since the last washings pass\r\nthe filter very slowly, they can be removed after the complete\r\ndeposition of the matter they contain, by means of a pipette. When all\r\nthe liquid is removed the filter is placed upon blotting paper, great\r\ncare being taken to avoid desiccation, having in view only the\r\nelimination of the excess of humidity. The folds in the filter are then\r\ncarefully smoothed out with the finger. The matter which has collected\r\nupon the filter is then removed completely with a washing bottle, placed\r\nin a dish and dried at 100° and weighed. After weighing, the mass is\r\nincinerated in a muffle in order to destroy the humic bodies. The\r\ndifference in weight before and after incineration, gives the total\r\nweight of the humic bodies and since the diminution in weight comprises\r\nnot only the weight of the humic bodies, but also the weight of the\r\ncombined water which is lost during the process of incineration, there\r\nshould be subtracted from the total loss of weight ten per cent of the\r\nweight of the residual mineral matter, which represents the water of\r\ncomposition of the hydrated silicate.\r\n\r\n=210. Statement of the Analysis.=—Schloesing in his original paper[144]\r\nrecommends that the analysis be commenced with 1,000 grams of soil. The\r\ndata of the analysis and the method of arrangement are illustrated by\r\nthe following example.\r\n\r\nThe physical examination of the earth having been completed as above,\r\nthe results can be tabulated as follows: taken, 1,000 grams of dry\r\nearth, digested in water, thoroughly worked by hand, sifted, and passed\r\nthrough the meshes of the sieve by a stream of water, the meshes having\r\na diameter of one millimeter.\r\n\r\n   Dry residue, fifty-five grams, contains Pebbles       │  21 grams.\r\n                      „                    Gravel        │  33   „\r\n                      „                    Organic débris│   1   „\r\n\r\n   Sifted earth by difference, 1000 − 55 =               │ 945   „\r\n                                                         │————\r\n                                                         │1000 grams.\r\n\r\nHumidity of the homogeneous paste, twenty-seven per cent.

In order that the liquid should\r\nbecome entirely freed from this sand it would be necessary to wait\r\nseveral weeks and even several months. Such a prolongation of the\r\nanalysis is evidently inadmissible. The period of twenty-four hours of\r\nrepose therefore has been adopted. This is merely conventional, in the\r\nsame way that the period of ten seconds adopted for the precipitation of\r\nthe gravel is conventional. But this convention is justified by the fact\r\nthat the substance which is called clay presents, when it has a proper\r\ndegree of humidity and cohesion, a plasticity entirely analogous to that\r\nproperty of natural clay. Moreover, as has already been said, that which\r\nis chiefly important in these analyses is the employment of processes\r\nalways comparable among themselves in their results and generally\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n=211. The Belgian Method.=—The method of estimating the percentage of\r\nsand and clay practiced at the Gembloux Station[145] is essentially that\r\nrecommended by Schloesing with a few minor modifications.\r\n\r\nWith the ball of the thumb or with the finger, 100 grams of fine earth\r\nare rubbed with water in a porcelain capsule or mortar with a capacity\r\nof about 250 cubic centimeters. The suspended particles are poured off\r\nwith the wash water and the process repeated five or six times, using in\r\nall about 200 cubic centimeters of water.\r\n\r\nThe water containing the sediment is rendered slightly acid\r\n(hydrochloric acid) adding the acid in minute particles with constant\r\nstirring for about an hour in order to dissolve all the carbonate and to\r\nseparate the organic acids from the bases with which they are combined.\r\n\r\nThe liquid is allowed to remain at rest for five or six hours and a part\r\nof the liquor decanted to remove any supernatant particles of organic\r\nmatter which may have passed the sieve in the original preparations of\r\nthe sample. Filter through a smooth filter about twelve centimeters in\r\ndiameter, wash until the chlorin has disappeared, and throw the filtrate\r\naway.\r\n\r\nBreak the filter paper over the vessel in which the soil was treated\r\nwith hydrochloric acid and wash all the contents of the filter into this\r\nvessel with as little water as possible (about 100 cubic centimeters),\r\nadd five cubic centimeters of strong ammonia water, allow to stand for\r\nthree hours, shaking from time to time and with distilled water make the\r\nvolume up to 250 cubic centimeters. Stir vigorously with a glass rod or\r\nspatula, take this out and wash any adhering particles back, leave at\r\nrest for twenty-four hours, siphon the turbid liquid into a two-liter\r\nvessel. Make the volume up again to 250 cubic centimeters and treat as\r\nabove described and repeat the operation until the water becomes clear\r\nafter standing for twenty-four hours. Usually eight or ten washings are\r\nnecessary. Wash the residual sand into a weighed dish, evaporate to\r\ndryness, ignite and weigh. The weight obtained divided by the weight of\r\nthe original sample gives the per cent of sand. The sand is separated by\r\nsieves of varying fineness into coarse, fine, and pulverulent sand.\r\n\r\nAdd to the ammoniacal liquor collected in the two-liter flask some\r\npowdered potassium chlorid (five grams per liter) to hasten the\r\ncoagulation and rapid deposit of the clay.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-four hours siphon the clear liquor, collect the deposited\r\nclay in a smaller vessel, allow to remain at rest and decant as much of\r\nthe clear liquor as possible. Pass through a plain tared filter about\r\nnine centimeters in diameter, dry at 150° and weigh the clay.\r\n\r\n=212. The Italian Method.=—Schloesing’s method as carried out by the\r\nItalian chemists[146] is as follows:\r\n\r\nA kilo of earth dried in the air is passed through a sieve the threads\r\nof which are separated a distance of five millimeters; and with this the\r\nsmall pebbles are separated.\r\n\r\nWith another sieve having spaces of one millimeter, the coarse sand is\r\nseparated. The pebbles and sand are dried, weighed, treated with\r\nhydrochloric acid and again weighed in order to find the quantity of\r\ncalcareous matter contained in them. In ten grams of this fine earth the\r\nhumidity is determined by drying at 100°.\r\n\r\nTen grams are mixed in a capsule with fifteen to twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of water and after eight to ten seconds the supernatant\r\nliquid is poured into a beaker having a capacity of 250 cubic\r\ncentimeters. The same operation is repeated until there are contained in\r\nthe beaker the fine sand and the clay, while the coarser sand remains in\r\nthe capsule.\r\n\r\nThis last is then dried and weighed and the quantity of calcium\r\ncarbonate determined by treating it with diluted nitric acid. By means\r\nof calcination the organic matter is determined. The liquid decanted in\r\nthe beaker, the volume of which must not surpass 200 to 250 cubic\r\ncentimeters, is treated with nitric acid, filtered after some time,\r\nwashed and the calcium is directly determined by precipitating the\r\nsolution with ammonium oxalate.\r\n\r\nThe part in the filter which contains the fine sand, the clay, and the\r\nhumus material is mixed with water to a volume of about 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters; there are then added to it two to three cubic centimeters\r\nof ammonia and after two or three hours it is diluted to a liter and\r\nstrongly agitated.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-four hours of rest it is decanted and the residuum is\r\ntreated a second time with diluted ammonia, decanting after twenty-four\r\nhours. Ordinarily these two treatments suffice, if, however, the earth\r\nis very argillaceous, this operation should be repeated three and even\r\nfour times.\r\n\r\nThe clay which is found in the liquid suspended in colloidal form\r\ncoagulates and is precipitated by adding thirty to forty cubic\r\ncentimeters of a saturated solution of potassium chlorid, while the\r\nhumus substance, under the influence of the ammonia remains dissolved.\r\n\r\nSestini found that the method of Schloesing was the only one which\r\nindicated exactly the quantity of clay in the soil. He modified this\r\nmethod by reducing the time of rest from twenty-four hours, as proposed\r\nby Schloesing, to only twelve hours, a reduction which in his opinion\r\ndoes not in the least impair the exactness of the method.\r\n\r\nSestini also proposes twelve treatments instead of six.\r\n\r\n\r\n        SEPARATION OF THE SOIL PARTICLES BY A LIQUID IN MOTION.\r\n\r\n=213. General Principles.=—The laws, already discussed, applying to the\r\nsubsidence of a solid particle in a liquid, are equally applicable to\r\nthe separation of the particle by imparting a motion to the liquid at a\r\ngiven rate. If a solid particle subside in a given liquid at the rate of\r\none millimeter per second it follows that this particle will remain at\r\nrest if the liquid be set in motion upward with a like velocity. If the\r\nvelocity be greater the particle will be carried upward and eventually\r\nout of the containing vessel. Such a particle is said to have a\r\nhydraulic value of one millimeter per second. If there be a perfect\r\nseparation of a soil into its constituent particles and no subsequent\r\nflocculation, all the particles of one millimeter hydraulic value and\r\nless will be separated by a current of the velocity mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe general principles on which the separation rests, therefore, are the\r\nsecuring of the proper granulation of the sample and the maintenance of\r\na fixed velocity of the current until the separation is finished. The\r\nseparation must be commenced with a period of subsidence so as to remove\r\nfirst of all the suspended clay or impalpable particles. The velocity\r\ncan then be increased in a certain fixed ratio to secure a separation\r\ninto particles of any required hydraulic value.\r\n\r\n=214. Nöbel’s Apparatus.=—One of the earliest methods of separating the\r\nsoil particles by a moving liquid is that of Nöbel.[147] The apparatus\r\nis shown in Fig. 28. The four separating vessels 1, 2, 3, 4 are of\r\nglass, pear shaped, and have a relative capacity of 1³, 2³, 3³, 4³, or 1\r\n: 8 : 27 : 64. No. 4 has an outlet tube leading to the beaker B, of such\r\na capacity as to allow the passage of just nine liters of water in forty\r\nminutes, constant pressure being maintained by means of a Mariotte’s\r\nbottle or of the constant level apparatus A, _a_, _b_, which is\r\nconnected with the main water supply through the tube _a_ by means of a\r\nrubber hose. The reservoir C should hold about ten liters. The sample of\r\nsoil to be separated should be previously boiled and passed through a\r\nsieve having circular openings one millimeter in diameter. The flask in\r\nwhich the sample is boiled is allowed to stand for some time when the\r\nmuddy supernatant liquid is poured into elutriator No. 2 and the\r\nremaining sediment washed into No. 1. No. 1 is filled with water by\r\nconnecting it with the water supply and opening the pinch-cock _p_. The\r\nwater is carefully admitted until the air is all driven out and Nos. 1\r\nand 2 connected. The cock _p_ is then opened and the vessels all filled,\r\nand the water allowed to run into B for forty minutes, the level being\r\nmaintained uniformly at A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 28.\r\n\r\n  NÖBEL’S ELUTRIATOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the water used, four liters are found in the elutriating vessels and\r\nnine liters in the receiving vessel No. 5. The apparatus is left\r\nstanding for an hour until the liquid in the elutriators is clear and\r\nthe portions in each vessel are received on weighed filters dried at\r\n125°, and the weight of each portion determined.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the loss on ignition of each part be also\r\ndetermined. The separated particles thus secured are classified as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Débris and gravel. No. 2. Coarse sand. No. 3. Fine sand. No. 4.\r\nClayey sand. No. 5. Finest parts or clay.\r\n\r\nAlthough the method of Nöbel has been much used, the results which it\r\ngives are entirely misleading. The convection currents produced in the\r\nconical vessels by the passing water and the flocculation of the soil\r\nparticles prevent any sharp separation into classes of distinct\r\nhydraulic value. The process may be useful for a qualitative test, but\r\nits chief claim to a place in this manual is in its historic interest\r\narising from its use in the first attempts at silt analysis.\r\n\r\n=215. Method of Dietrich.=[148]—The difficulties attending the silt\r\nseparation by the Nöbel method, led Dietrich to construct an apparatus\r\nin which the sides of the elutriating vessels were parallel, but these\r\nvessels, with the exception of the first, were not set in an upright\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 29.\r\n\r\n  DIETRICH’S ELUTRIATOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus (Fig. 29) consists of a series of cylindrical vessels\r\nconnected by rubber tubing.\r\n\r\nThe elutriators are of the following dimensions:\r\n\r\n\r\n  No. 1. Seventeen centimeters long, 2.8 centimeters in diameter,\r\n  position upright.\r\n\r\n  No. 2. Thirty-four centimeters long, four centimeters in diameter,\r\n  inclined 67°.5.\r\n\r\n  No. 3. Fifty-one centimeters long, 5.2 centimeters in diameter,\r\n  inclined 45°.\r\n\r\n  No. 4. Sixty-eight centimeters long, 6.4 centimeters in diameter,\r\n  inclined 22°.5.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rubber tubes passing from one vessel to the other are furnished with\r\npinch-cocks so that each one of the elutriating vessels can be shut off\r\nfrom the others and independently removed from the circuit.\r\n\r\nThe stream of water is made to pass through the apparatus under a\r\nconstant pressure of one meter.\r\n\r\nOnly the fine earth, boiled with water or hydrochloric acid, is to be\r\nplaced in the apparatus. The part coming through a sieve with a mesh\r\n0.67 millimeters is to be used and placed in No. 1. About thirty grams\r\nof soil, are employed for each elutriation. Before adding the soil, the\r\nair is completely removed from all parts of the apparatus by connecting\r\nit with the water supply and allowing it to be filled with water.\r\n\r\nThe rate of flow is controlled by the orifice of the last effluent tube\r\nand the analyst is directed to continue the operation until the effluent\r\nwater collected in the beaker glass (5) is clear. The particles then\r\nremaining in each of the vessels are collected separately.\r\n\r\nThe author of the method claims that in respect of likeness of particles\r\nthe results are especially gratifying and that duplicate analyses give\r\nresults fully comparable. The process, however, has not commended itself\r\nto analysts, but it marks a distinct progress toward the principles of\r\nlater investigators. Had each of the elutriating vessels been placed\r\nupright and the rate of flow determined, the apparatus of Dietrich would\r\nhave served, to a certain extent, for the more rigid investigations of\r\nhis successors.\r\n\r\n=216. Method of Masure.=—The sifted earth, from ten to fifteen grams, is\r\ncarefully mixed with 200 cubic centimeters of water. It is then\r\nintroduced into a doubly conical elutriator B, Fig. 30, of about 250\r\ncubic centimeters capacity. A current of distilled water is allowed to\r\nflow from a Mariotte’s bottle, A, which secures a regular and constant\r\nflow. The bottle A is joined to the elutriator B by means of a rubber\r\ntube and the vertical glass tube D, the top of which is expanded into a\r\nfunnel for the purpose of receiving the water from the Mariotte flask.\r\nThe current of water flowing upward through the elutriator B carries in\r\nsuspension the most finely divided particles of clay, and these are\r\ncollected with the emergent water in the receiver C. The sand and\r\ncoarser particles of clay remain in the elutriator. The water flows out\r\nby the tube F, the diameter of which should be less than that of D. When\r\nthe emergent water becomes limpid the operation is terminated. After the\r\napparatus is disconnected, the water is decanted from the sand in the\r\nelutriator, and the whole residue is weighed after drying for two hours\r\nat 110°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 30.\r\n\r\n  MASURE’S SILT APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fine soil collected in C may also be separated and weighed, for\r\ncontrol, after drying as above.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles and coarse sand separated by the sieves should also be\r\nweighed. By this process the soil is separated into four portions;\r\n_viz._,\r\n\r\n(1) Pebbles. (2) Coarse sand. (3) Fine sand and other materials not\r\ncarried off by the current of water. (4) Fine soil, carried into the\r\nreceiver C.\r\n\r\n=217. Method of Schöne.=—The method of Schöne[149] is based on the\r\ncombination of a cylindrical and conical separatory tube through which\r\nthe flow of water is regulated by a piezometer.\r\n\r\nIf, in the process of silt separation, the water move perpendicularly\r\nupward with a given velocity, _e.g._ = v the separation is dependent:\r\n\r\n(1) On the volume of the silt particles, (2) On their specific gravity,\r\nand, (3) On their state of disintegration.\r\n\r\nIf it be assumed that the silt particle is a sphere with a diameter = d,\r\nthen according to Newton’s law of gravity, the following formula would\r\nbe applied: d = v² ((3Z)/(4g (S − 1))).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 31.\r\n\r\n  SCHÖNE’S ELUTRIATOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the above formula Z = a coefficient which depends on the condition of\r\nthe surface against which the hydraulic pressure or resistance works, in\r\nthis case a sphere; g = the acceleration of gravity equivalent to 9.81\r\nmeter; and S = the specific gravity of the particle.\r\n\r\nThis expression signifies that in a given case, the velocity of the\r\ncurrent in the apparatus is just sufficient to counteract the tendency\r\nof a given particle to sink. All particles of a smaller diameter, in\r\nsuch a case, will be carried on by the current, while all of a greater\r\ndiameter would separate by sedimentation. These theoretical conditions\r\nare not met with in practice where silt particles of all shapes and\r\ndegrees of aggregation abound. These particles, whatever their shape,\r\nmay be said to have the same hydraulic value when carried by the same\r\ncurrent. It is necessary, therefore, to secure some uniform standard of\r\nexpression to assume a normal form of particle and a normal specific\r\ngravity. For the form, a sphere is evidently the normal which must be\r\nconsidered and for specific gravity that of quartz is taken; _viz._,\r\n2.65. The mean coefficient for Z may also be placed at 0.55, although\r\nslightly different values are ascribed to it. Substituting these values\r\nin the formula, it is reduced to the expression; d = v² × 0.0000255\r\nmillimeters. It can, therefore, be said that by this or that velocity of\r\nthe current, silt particles will be removed of this or that diameter, it\r\nbeing understood that all particles of equal hydraulic value to\r\nspherules of quartz of the given diameter are included in each class. In\r\norder to have the theoretical formula agree with the results of analysis\r\nit is necessary to modify it empirically to read d = v^{⁷⁄₁₁} × 0.0314\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\nThis formula is found to agree well with the results obtained for all\r\nvelocities between 0.1 millimeter and twelve millimeters per second, the\r\nordinary limits of silt separation.\r\n\r\n_The Apparatus._—The conic-cylindrical elutriating vessel A, B, C, D, E,\r\nF, G, Fig. 31, is of glass. The part B, C, is cylindrical, ten\r\ncentimeters in length and as nearly as possible five centimeters in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe conical part C, D, is fifty centimeters in length. Its inner\r\ndiameter at D must not be greater than five centimeters nor smaller than\r\nfour centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe bend, D, E, F, should have the same diameter; _viz._, four to five\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nThe part A, B, C, D, and D, E, F, G, may be made of separate parts and\r\njoined by a rubber tube.\r\n\r\n_Outflow Tube and Piezometer._—The outflow tube and piezometer, H, J, K,\r\nL, is constructed as shown in Fig. 32. It should be made of barometer\r\ntubing having an internal diameter of about three millimeters. The tube\r\nis bent at J at an angle of forty to forty-five degrees. The knee J must\r\nbe as acute as possible not to interfere with the inner diameter. The\r\nform and especially the magnitude of the outlet are of great importance.\r\nIt must be circular and nearly 1.5 millimeter in diameter. It must not\r\nbe larger than 1.67 millimeter nor smaller than 1.5 millimeter. The\r\nopening should be so made as to direct the stream of outflowing liquid\r\nin the direction shown by the arrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 32.\r\n\r\n  SCHÖNE’S ELUTRIATOR, OUTFLOW TUBE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe piezometer L, K is parallel to the arm H, J, of the delivery tube.\r\nIts graduation has its zero point in the center of the outlet K. It\r\ncommences with the one centimeter mark. From one to five centimeters it\r\nis divided into millimeters, from five to ten centimeters into\r\none-fourth centimeter, from ten to fifty centimeters into one-half\r\ncentimeter, and from fifty to 100 centimeters into centimeters. The\r\ndimensions given are those required for ordinary soils and for\r\nvelocities ranging from two-tenths millimeter to four millimeters per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nFor greater velocities, a delivery tube with a larger outlet must be\r\nused and the piezometer must be of greater internal diameter than\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 33.\r\n\r\n  SCHÖNE’S ELUTRIATOR, ARRANGEMENT OF APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Arrangement of the Apparatus._—The apparatus is conveniently mounted as\r\nshown in Fig. 33, giving front and side views of all parts of apparatus\r\nin position ready for use. When numerous analyses are to be made much\r\ntime is saved by having a number of apparatus arranged _en batterie_.\r\n\r\n_The Sieve._—The soil, before being subjected to elutriation, should be\r\npassed through a sieve of which the meshes are 0.2 millimeter square.\r\n\r\n_The Process._—To measure the diameter of the cylinder, two marks are\r\nmade with a diamond upon the glass which are distant from each other a\r\ncertain space, for instance, _h_ centimeters. The space between these\r\ntwo marks is filled with water exactly measured. Suppose that a cubic\r\ncentimeters were used, then the diameter is determined by the formula:\r\n\r\n                    D = √(4_a_)/(π_h_) centimeters.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine that the elutriating cylinder is strictly\r\ncomparable in all its parts this measurement should be made upon several\r\nparts thereof.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus should now be tested in regard to the quantity of liquid\r\nwhich it will deliver under a given pressure in the piezometer. By means\r\nof the stop-cock H the flow of water is so regulated that the outflow at\r\n_c_ can be measured at a given height of the water in the piezometer.\r\nSuppose that _a_ cubic centimeters of water flow in _t_ seconds, then\r\nthe quantity which would flow in one second is determined by the\r\nformula, Q = a/t cubic centimeters. Since according to the law of\r\nhydraulic outflow the quantities are proportional to the square root of\r\nthe height of the column it is easy to compute from any given height the\r\nquantity which will flow from any other one desired. For the retardation\r\ndue to capillary attraction, it is sufficient, in general, to take it in\r\na constant quantity; if this constant quantity be represented by C, the\r\nobserved height of the water in the piezometer by _h_, and the quantity\r\nof water flowing out by Q, the data required for any given velocity can\r\nbe calculated from the following proportion:\r\n\r\n                  √(_h_₁ − C) : √(_h_₂ − C) = Q₁ : Q₂.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to compute the magnitude of this constant C which is to\r\nbe subtracted. This is accomplished by measuring the quantity of water\r\nwhich flows out at two different heights of the column in the\r\npiezometer. From the foregoing proportion, the value of C is as follows:\r\n\r\n          C = (Q₁² _h_₂ − Q₂² _h_₁)/(Q₁²) − Q₂²) centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe value of C can be the more exactly determined as _h_₁ is greater and\r\n_h_₂ smaller. It is best to choose the lowest height from which an exact\r\nreading can be made; that is, by which the regular rise and fall of the\r\nlevel of the water in the piezometer (in consequence of the formation of\r\ndrops) just begins to disappear. This usually takes place when _h_₂ =\r\n1.5 centimeter to 1.7 centimeter. For the higher value _h_₁ it is best\r\nto take about 100 centimeters. Suppose, for example, the following\r\nresults are obtained:\r\n\r\n                                                           Height of\r\n                                                         column to be\r\n      Observed height.

The\r\ndiameter of this cylinder being D the equation is derived\r\n\r\n                     _v_ = Q(4)/(πD²) centimeters.\r\n\r\nSince the velocity in the elutriating cylinder v is directly as the\r\nquantity of water overflowing so is\r\n\r\n                 _v_ : _v_ₙ = √(_h_ − C) : √(_h_ₙ − C);\r\n\r\n                then _v_ₙ = √(_h_ₙ − C) (_v_)/(√(h − C))\r\n\r\n and _h_ₙ = _v_ₙ²((_h_ − C)/(_v_²) + C. The constant  (_h_ − C)/(_v_²)\r\n\r\nis obtained from the means of a number of estimations; for example as\r\nillustrated in the following data:\r\n\r\n                     Observed     Corresponding velocity\r\n                    quantity of   in elutriating cylinder      Constant.\r\n Observed height, outflow, cubic   of 4.489 centimeters         (_h_ −\r\n   centimeters.    centimeters.   diameter, millimeters.

The table will show at once\r\nunder what pressure of water the piezometer must be placed in order to\r\ngive the values; _viz._, 1.4, 2.8, 7.0, 15.0, 29.0, 53.0, and 83.0\r\ncentimeters respectively.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus described above, is adapted for velocities in the\r\nelutriating cylinder varying from two-tenths millimeter to four\r\nmillimeters per second. The largest silt particles which can be\r\nseparated by the velocities given above, have approximately a diameter\r\nof 0.08 millimeter. For the separation of larger particles a sieve can\r\ntake the place of the silt apparatus. If, however, it be desired to\r\nsubject larger particles to silt analysis, the dimensions of the\r\nelutriating cylinder and of the outlet of the delivery tube must be\r\nchanged accordingly.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Sample._—The conduct of silt analysis of natural soils\r\nmust, in certain cases, be preceded by a special treatment of the\r\nsample. If the latter be rich in humus the organic substance must\r\npreviously be separated as completely as possible. With sandy soils this\r\ncan be accomplished by ignition. With clayey soils, on the contrary, it\r\nis to be performed by boiling the soils at least one hour with water\r\nwhich contains from one to two per cent of free alkali. Soils which\r\ncontain lime must also be subjected to treatment with dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, and the hydrochloric acid must be as carefully\r\nremoved, as possible before the sample is subjected to elutriation;\r\nafterward follows the boiling of the sample in the ordinary way with\r\nwater. This, of course, can be omitted when it has already been treated\r\nwith boiling dilute alkali. It is also important to remove the larger\r\nparticles by a sieve before the elutriation begins. It is well to pass a\r\nsample through a sieve after it has been boiled, by which all particles\r\nof a larger diameter than 0.2 millimeter are removed. This will usually\r\nrequire about one liter of water and this water should be allowed to\r\nrest from one to two hours and poured off with the suspended material\r\nwhich it contains. Only what subsides should be brought into the\r\napparatus. In rinsing the sample as much water must be used as will fill\r\nthe apparatus up to its cylindrical portion.\r\n\r\nAfter the sample has been placed in the apparatus, the water is allowed\r\nslowly to enter, being careful to avoid reaching more than the lowest\r\nrequired velocity, until the outflow begins. The water then is so\r\nregulated by the stop-cock as to bring it to the desired height in the\r\npiezometer. This being accomplished, the different velocities which have\r\nbeen decided upon for separating the particles of silt are used one\r\nafter the other, as soon as all the silt which can be removed at each\r\ngiven velocity, has been secured. From three to five liters of water\r\nwill be required for the separation of each class of particles.\r\nSometimes the reading of the height of the water in the piezometer is\r\ndifficult; as, for instance, when foam or bubbles accumulate therein.\r\nThese bubbles can be removed by simply blowing into the tube, or\r\ndropping into it a little ether. The outflow of water can be received in\r\nvessels, beaker glasses, or cylinders, in which it is allowed to\r\nsubside. The finest particles which remain in suspension in the water\r\nare best determined by difference. If it be desired to weigh them\r\ndirectly, the water can be treated with ammonium bicarbonate until it\r\ncontains from one to two per cent thereof. The precipitation then takes\r\nplace in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe collection and weighing of silt particles are accomplished in the\r\nusual way. That which finally remains in the elutriating vessel is taken\r\nout after the end of the operation by closing the stop-cock, removing\r\nthe stoppers with the piezometer tube, pouring the contents of the\r\nelutriating vessel into a beaker glass and rinsing out carefully all\r\nadhering particles. Examples of the working of the apparatus follow:\r\n\r\nThe soil was taken from the Imperial Russian Agricultural Experimental\r\nInstitute at Gorki. It was a fine clay sand and was carefully treated\r\nwith hydrochloric acid.

Mayer’s Modification of Schöne’s Method.=—An improvement of\r\nSchöne’s apparatus in the direction of greater simplicity has been\r\ntested by Mayer[150] with satisfactory results:\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, (Fig. 34), consists of a glass vessel having a glass\r\nstop-cock at the bottom for admitting the water. For a distance of\r\ntwenty centimeters the sides of the tube are parallel and the diameter\r\nabout one centimeter. Next for a distance of fifty centimeters the tube\r\nis conical expanding at a regular rate until the internal diameter\r\nreaches five centimeters. For a distance of ten centimeters the vessel\r\nis again strictly cylindrical and it is in this cylindrical portion that\r\nthe separation of the different constituents takes place. The vessel is\r\nthen rapidly narrowed until it carries the stopper A two centimeters in\r\ndiameter. This stopper carries two glass tubes, one F bent downward to\r\nconduct the overflow into the receiving vessels, and one H for the\r\npurpose of regulating the rate of overflow by the height of the column\r\nof water therein. The orifice of the overflow tube F should be so\r\nregulated that with a pressure of five centimeters water in H, one liter\r\nshall pass over in ten minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 34.\r\n\r\n  SCHÖNE’S APPARATUS\r\n  FOR SILT\r\n  ANALYSIS,\r\n  MODIFIED\r\n  BY MAYER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the separation be conducted in an apparatus thus mounted and\r\ngraduated with a pressure of two centimeters in H all that portion of\r\nthe soil which can properly be called clay will pass over. The fine\r\nearth, that is, earth in which all coarse particles have been removed by\r\nproper sifting, is used in ten-gram lots for each experiment. The\r\nresidue, after the separation is complete, consists of pure sand or at\r\nleast pure sand mixed with humus. Before the fine earth is placed in the\r\napparatus, the calcium carbonate therein is removed with hydrochloric\r\nacid. The treatment with hydrochloric acid, however, is not to be\r\nrecommended in soil containing many undecomposed particles of calcium\r\ncarbonate or dolomite for then large additions to the silt output might\r\nbe made from these particles, which could not be regarded as coming from\r\nthe soil as it actually exists. For alluvial soil, however, previous\r\ntreatment with hydrochloric acid is recommended unconditionally.\r\n\r\n=219. Schöne’s Method as Practiced by Osborne.=—The apparatus used by\r\nOsborne[151] was obtained from Germany and was similar to that described\r\nby Schöne in his original paper, except that it was furnished with a\r\nsecond elutriating tube as suggested by Orth. The modification made by\r\nOrth consists, essentially, of a second elutriating tube with straight\r\nsides into which the bulk of the soil is introduced, only the final part\r\nbeing carried over into the Schöne’s tube proper. Water is supplied to\r\nthe apparatus under constant pressure by means of a Mariotte’s bottle.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary treatment recommended by Schöne is omitted, as these\r\nsteps have been shown to be undesirable, on account of affecting the\r\naccuracy of the results.\r\n\r\nTwenty grams of the air-dried soil are passed, under water, through a\r\nsieve of one-fourth millimeter mesh. That part of the soil which remains\r\nin suspension after being sifted is placed at once in the Schöne’s tube\r\nof the apparatus, the coarser portion being rinsed into the Orth tube.\r\nThe current is regulated so that the largest particles of quartz carried\r\noff have an average diameter of 0.01 millimeter. When all is carried off\r\nthat can be removed at this rate the current is increased until the\r\nlargest quartz grains passing off have a diameter of 0.05 millimeter.\r\n\r\nAs noticed by Hilgard with Schulze’s apparatus, secondary currents are\r\nformed during the process of elutriation which descend along the walls\r\nof the conical portion of the Schöne’s tube and some distance along the\r\nsides of the cylindrical portion. The tendency of these currents is to\r\nproduce globular aggregates of particles which fall to the bottom. They\r\nare broken up from time to time by increasing the velocity of the\r\ncurrent but even this method fails to disintegrate a considerable\r\nquantity of them.\r\n\r\n=220. Statement Of Results.=—Two samples of soil from the garden of the\r\nexperiment station analyzed by Schöne’s method gave the following\r\nproportions of sediment.\r\n\r\nIn the table the term clay is used to designate all that part of the\r\nsoil which has diameters less than 0.01 millimeter and which remains\r\nsuspended after twenty-four hours standing in water having a depth of\r\n200 millimeters.\r\n\r\n            SOIL, FROM GARDEN OF THE EXPERIMENT STATION.—NOT\r\n                                BOILED.\r\n               Analyses with the Schöne-Orth Elutriator.\r\n                                           _A._   _B._   _C._\r\n          Above 0.25 millimeter            48.82  48.82  48.82\r\n          0.25–0.05                        27.36  29.94  22.37\r\n          0.05–0.01 millimeter              8.63   6.07  13.70\r\n          0.01 millimeter and less depos.   7.36   7.31   7.20\r\n          Clay (by difference)              1.00   1.03   1.08\r\n          Loss on ignition                  6.83   6.83   6.83\r\n                                          —————— —————— ——————\r\n                                          100.00 100.00 100.00\r\n\r\nThe last column _C_ represents the average of three direct beaker\r\nelutriations according to the method of Osborne.\r\n\r\nThe differences which these figures show are found to be due to\r\nimperfect separation of the finer grades from the coarser and even when\r\nthe various fractions separated by the Schöne method are subjected to\r\nbeaker elutriation and the portions separated from them added to the\r\ngrades to which they properly belong the Schöne elutriator was found to\r\neffect far less exact separations than the beaker method.\r\n\r\nSamples of prairie soil from Mercer County, Ill., not boiled, were\r\nexamined by the two methods with the following results:\r\n\r\n                                         Schöne-Orth     Beaker\r\n                                         elutriation.   method.\r\n      Above 0.25 millimeter                      0.76         0.62\r\n      0.25–0.05 millimeter                      11.25         2.42\r\n      0.05–0.01 millimeter                      52.65        43.58\r\n      0.01 millimeter and less deposited        14.84        31.58\r\n      Clay                                       4.44         5.81\r\n      Loss on ignition                          14.49        14.49\r\n                                                —————        —————\r\n                                                98.43        98.50\r\n\r\nIn this case it is seen that Schöne’s method varies considerably from\r\nthe beaker method and if the beaker method be regarded as correct the\r\nSchöne method is evidently less reliable.\r\n\r\nIn the next table are given the data of the examination of brick clay\r\nfrom North Haven, Conn., by the two methods.\r\n\r\n                   BRICK CLAY FROM NORTH HAVEN, CONN.\r\n                             Schöne-Orth elutriation.

The Berlin-Schöne Method.=—Osborne has also made a study of the\r\nSchöne method as modified by the Bodenlaboratorium of Berlin. The\r\ndirections for the analysis by this laboratory method are as follows:\r\n\r\nFive hundred grams of the soil are sifted through a sieve with circular\r\nholes two millimeters in diameter. Of the earth passing the sieve from\r\n30 to 100 grams are boiled in water with constant stirring from one-half\r\nto one hour or longer, according to the character of the soil. The finer\r\nthe texture of the soil the smaller the quantity taken and the longer\r\nthe time of boiling. Treatment with acids or alkalies is not practiced.\r\n\r\nThe finer portion of the soil remaining suspended in the water, after\r\nboiling, is poured into the Schöne tube, the remaining coarse part is\r\nrinsed into the Orth tube. The clay, together with the finest sand, is\r\ncollected in a separate vessel, the water in which it is suspended is\r\nevaporated and the residue after drying in the air is weighed. The rest\r\nof the operation is carried out as previously described except that the\r\nproducts of elutriation are not ignited but weighed air dried, in order\r\nthat they may be further examined, chemically if desired. By proceeding\r\nin this manner the following results were obtained:\r\n\r\n              SOIL, FROM GARDEN OF THE EXPERIMENT STATION,\r\n                       BOILED FORTY-FIVE MINUTES.\r\n\r\n                Separations by the Berlin-Schöne method.\r\n\r\n                                       Air-dried.

On subjecting portions\r\nseparated by the Berlin-Schöne method to the beaker analysis additional\r\nseparations were secured. In the case of heavy loams the inability of\r\nthe Berlin-Schöne method to effect even a rough or approximate\r\nseparation of the several grades becomes very conspicuous.\r\n\r\n=222. Method of Hilgard.=—Two important principles lie at the foundation\r\nof this method; _viz._, 1, the use only of separating vessels of true\r\ncylindrical shape and 2, the employment of a mechanical stirrer to break\r\nup the floccules formed during the process of separation. The points in\r\nthe apparatus to be considered are uniformity of the cross section of\r\nthe elutriator at every point, exact perpendicularity of position,\r\ncareful control of the rate of flow and continuous operation of the\r\nmechanical stirrer. According to Hilgard’s observations the stirring due\r\nto the current of water alone is not sufficient to break up the\r\nfloccules unavoidably formed during the separation, while any\r\ninclination of the sides of the elutriating vessel from the\r\nperpendicular due either to a conical shape or false position favors in\r\nthe highest degree the formation of floccules due to reflex currents\r\nformed in the body of the liquid.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the idea suggested by Türschmidt of substituting\r\nfor the accidental and indefinite products usually appearing in the\r\nstatements of silt analyses sediments of known and definite hydraulic\r\nvalue a constant head of water is used, secured by means of a Mariotte’s\r\nbottle connecting with the tube delivering the current through a cock\r\nprovided with an arm moving on a graduated arc.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hilgard the separation of sediments by the method of\r\nsubsidence does not possess the analytical accuracy of the moving liquid\r\nmethod, especially when the latter is combined with mechanical stirring.\r\nThe subsidence method requires close and continuous attention and in the\r\ncase of fine sediments tending to flocculation the difficulties of the\r\nmethod are greatly increased. The views of Hilgard in respect of the\r\nlaboriousness of the subsidence method lose, however, some of their\r\nforce since the modifications of Osborne have come into use. The\r\nsimplicity and cheapness of the apparatus required for subsidence give\r\nit at the start many advantages over the more elaborate process with a\r\nchurn elutriator. For rigid scientific investigation, however, the\r\nmethod of Hilgard is commended as a standard of comparison in all cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 35. HILGARD’S CHURN ELUTRIATOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=223. The Elutriator.=—The instrument devised by Hilgard[152] for the\r\npurpose of breaking up these flocculent aggregates is shown in figure\r\n35, together with the simpler form, a Schöne’s elutriator, figure 36,\r\nwhich can serve for grain sizes above eight millimeters hydraulic value.\r\nThe latter is conveniently selected so as to have half the cross-section\r\nof the former, so that with the same position of the index lever the\r\nvelocity will be just doubled. The cylindrical glass tube, of about\r\nforty-five millimeters inside diameter at its mouth, and 290 to 300\r\nmillimeters high, has attached to its base a rotary churn consisting of\r\na brass cup, shaped like an egg with point down, so as to slope rather\r\nsteeply at base, and triply perforated; _viz._, at the bottom for\r\nconnection with the relay reservoir, and at the sides for the passage of\r\na horizontal axis bearing four grated wings. This axis, of course,\r\npasses through stuffing boxes, provided with good thick leather washers,\r\nsaturated with mutton tallow. These washers, if the axis runs true, will\r\nbear a million or more revolutions without material leakage. When a\r\nbeginning is noted additional washers may be slipped on without emptying\r\nthe instrument, until the analysis is finished. For the finest\r\nsediments, from five to six hundred revolutions per minute is a proper\r\nvelocity, which may be secured by clock work, turbine or electric power.\r\nThe driving pulley should not be directly connected with the axis, both\r\nbecause it is liable to cause leakage, and because it is necessary to be\r\nable to handle the elutriator quickly and independently. This is\r\naccomplished by the use of “dogs” on the pulley and churn axis. For the\r\ngrain sizes of one to eight millimeters hydraulic value lower velocities\r\nare sufficient; too low a velocity causes an indefinite duration of the\r\noperation and may be recognized by the increase of turbidity as the\r\nvelocity is increased.\r\n\r\nAs the whirling agitation caused by the rotation of the dasher would\r\ngradually communicate itself to the whole column of water and cause\r\nirregularities, a wire screen of 0.8 millimeter aperture is cemented to\r\nthe lower base of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe relay vessel should be a thick, conical test glass with foot; its\r\nobject is to serve as a reservoir for the heavy sediments not concerned\r\nat the velocity used in the elutriator tube, and whose presence in the\r\nlatter or in its base, the churn, would only cause abrasion of the\r\ngrains and changes of current velocity, such as occur in the apparatus\r\nof Schöne, and compel the current measurement of the water delivered. It\r\nis connected above with the churn by a brass tube about ten millimeters\r\nin clear diameter, so as to facilitate the descent of the superfluous\r\nsediments, which the operator, knowing the proportion of area between\r\nthe connecting tube and elutriator, can carry to any desired extent;\r\nthus avoiding the disturbance of the gauged current velocities, as well\r\nas all material abrasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 36.\r\n\r\n  IMPROVED SCHÖNE’S APPARATUS\r\n  WITH\r\n  RELAY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA glass delivery tube should extend quite half way down the sides of the\r\nrelay vessel, to insure a full stirring up of the coarse sediments when\r\nrequired. By means of a rubber hose, not less than twenty inches in\r\nlength, this delivery tube connects with the siphon carrying the water\r\nfrom near the bottom of the Mariotte’s bottle, a ten-gallon acid carboy.\r\nA stop-cock provided with a long, stiff index lever, moving on an\r\nempirically graduated arc, regulates the delivery of water through the\r\nsiphon. Knowing the area of the cross section of the elutriator tube,\r\nthe number of cubic centimeters of water which should pass through it in\r\none minute, at one millimeter velocity, is easily calculated, and from\r\nthis the lever positions corresponding to other velocities are quickly\r\ndetermined and marked on the graduated arc. The receiving bottle for the\r\nsediments, also shown in the figure, must be wide and tall, so as to\r\nallow the sediment to settle while the water flows from the top into the\r\nwaste pipe. The receiving funnel tube must dip nearly to the bottom of\r\nthe bottle. Thus arranged, the instrument works very satisfactorily, and\r\nby its aid soils and clays may readily be separated into sediments of\r\nany hydraulic value desired. But in order to insure correct and\r\nconcordant results, it is necessary to observe some precautions; _viz._,\r\n\r\n(1) The tube of the instrument must be as nearly cylindrical as possible\r\nand must be placed and maintained in a truly vertical position. A very\r\nslight variation from the vertical at once causes the formation of\r\nreturn currents, and hence of molecular aggregates on the lower side.\r\n\r\n(2) Sunshine, or the proximity of any other source of heat, must be\r\ncarefully excluded. The currents formed when the instrument is exposed\r\nto sunshine will vitiate the results.\r\n\r\n(3) The Mariotte’s bottle should be frequently cleansed, and the water\r\nused be as free from foreign matters as possible. For ordinary purposes\r\nit is scarcely necessary to use distilled water. The quantities used are\r\nso large as to render it difficult to maintain an adequate supply, and\r\nthe errors resulting from the use of any water fit for drinking purposes\r\nare too slight to be perceptible, so long as no considerable development\r\nof the animal and vegetable germs is allowed. Water containing the slimy\r\nfilaments of fungoid growths and moss protonema, algae, vorticellae,\r\netc., will not only cause errors by obstructing the stop-cock at low\r\nvelocities, but these organisms will cause a coalescence of sediments\r\nthat defies any ordinary churning, and completely vitiates the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n(4) The amount of sediment discharged at any time must not exceed that\r\nproducing a moderate turbidity. Whenever the discharge becomes so\r\ncopious as to render the moving column opaque, the sediments assume a\r\nmixed character, coarse grains being, apparently, upborne by the\r\nmultitude of light ones whose hydraulic value lies considerably below\r\nthe velocity used, while the churner also fails to resolve the molecular\r\naggregates which must be perpetually reforming where contact is so close\r\nand frequent. This difficulty is especially apt to occur when too large\r\na quantity of material has been used for analysis, or when one sediment\r\nconstitutes an unusually large portion of it. Within certain limits the\r\nsmaller the quantity employed the more concordant are the results.\r\nBetween ten and fifteen grams is the proper amount for an instrument of\r\nthe dimensions given above.\r\n\r\n=224. Preparation of the Sample.=[153]—In some cases simple sifting will\r\nbe sufficient to prepare the air-dried soil for the elutriator. In most\r\ncases, however, some mechanical aid must be invoked to secure particles\r\nof sufficient fineness. Nothing harder than a rubber pestle should be\r\nused and care must be taken not to break up any calcareous or\r\nferruginous masses which the particles of fine soil may contain. The use\r\nof water in this mechanical attrition should be avoided, if possible,\r\nbut in some heavy clay and adobe soils wetting becomes necessary. In\r\nthis case the parts separated by the sieve are collected separately and\r\nthe turbid mass removed by water and dried for further examination.\r\n\r\nA sieve of 0.5 millimeter mesh is recommended as the best because that\r\nis almost exactly the diameter of the particles passing off at the\r\nmaximum velocity of sixty-four millimeters per second to which the\r\nelutriator is adapted. The particles passing the 0.5 millimeter mesh are\r\ncalled fine earth.\r\n\r\n=225. Preparation by Boiling.=—The method of preparation by boiling may\r\nbe applied to all samples of fine earth. The fact pointed out by\r\nOsborne, that diffusibility of some clays is diminished by long boiling,\r\nrenders it important to restrict the time of this operation as much as\r\npossible. With most soils from eight to fifteen hours will be long\r\nenough, occasionally extending to even twenty-four hours. A thin\r\nlong-necked flask of about one-liter capacity should be used; filled\r\nthree-quarters full with distilled water and the sample of soil added.\r\nThe flask is supported over the lamp on a piece of wire gauze at an\r\nangle of 45°. It carries a cork with a long condensing tube. At first\r\nthe boiling goes on smoothly, but after a time violent bumping may\r\nsupervene, endangering the flask but promoting the object in view.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the flask are transferred to a beaker and diluted with\r\ndistilled water to one and a half liters, shaken and allowed to settle\r\nfor a time necessary to allow all particles of 0.25 millimeter hydraulic\r\nvalue to reach the bottom. The supernatant turbid liquid is decanted and\r\nthe process repeated with smaller quantities of water until no further\r\nturbidity is produced. The united decantations, of which there will be\r\nfrom four to eight liters, are well shaken and a proper time allowed for\r\nthe 0.25 millimeter hydraulic value sediments to fall. This last step is\r\nnecessary to remove any such sediments which may have been carried over\r\nmechanically in the first separation. The dilution being very great, a\r\nfairly perfect separation is thus secured and the sediments are then\r\nready for the elutriator.\r\n\r\n=226. Separation of Clay and Finest Silt.=—The property which pure clay\r\npossesses, of remaining suspended almost indefinitely in pure water,\r\naffords a ready means of separation from the silt particles of less than\r\n0.25 millimeter hydraulic value. But the finest silt particles subside\r\nso slowly that this method of separation is too long to become\r\npractically applicable to secure a perfect demarcation between the\r\nfinest silt and so-called colloidal clay.\r\n\r\nHilgard recommends the following procedure: The clay water from the\r\nprevious separation is placed in a cylindrical vessel of such a diameter\r\nas to allow the column of water to be 200 millimeters high where it is\r\nallowed to settle for twenty-four hours. When the clay is very abundant\r\na longer time may be allowed; _viz._, from forty to sixty hours. The\r\nline of separation between the dark silt below and the translucent clay\r\nabove is sharply defined. Finally the clay water is decanted and the\r\nremaining liquid poured off leaving the sediment as sharply defined as\r\npossible. The sediment is rubbed with a rubber pestle and a few drops of\r\nammonia water added. Distilled water is added, the beaker well shaken or\r\nstirred to break up the floccules that may have formed and subsidence\r\npermitted as before. This operation is repeated from six to nine times\r\nuntil the water remains quite clear after subsidence or the decanted\r\nturbid water fails to be precipitated by brine showing the suspended\r\nmatter to be fine silt and not clay.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the particles of silt thus obtained is from 0.001 to\r\n0.02 millimeter, and it is impossible to obtain it quite free from any\r\nadmixture with clay.\r\n\r\n=227. Estimation of the Colloidal Clay.=—The importance of the colloidal\r\nconstituent of the clay is such as to make its direct determination\r\ndesirable. The volume of the clay waters at this stage of the analysis\r\nmay amount to twenty liters. One method of determination consists in\r\nevaporating an aliquot portion and this method will yield good results\r\nif the sample be free from soluble salts and the quantity taken be not\r\ntoo small. At least 500 cubic centimeters should be used for this\r\npurpose. A better method consists in precipitating the clay by means of\r\na saline solution. A saturated solution of salt is recommended for this\r\npurpose of which fifty cubic centimeters are sufficient to precipitate\r\nthe clay from one liter of the clay water. The precipitation is hastened\r\nby heating. Each portion of the clay water should be precipitated as\r\nsoon as obtained, the total volume of the precipitate at the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours is thus reduced to a minimum. The clay water from the\r\nsucceeding separations of the same analysis can be mixed with the\r\nprecipitate which diffuses therein, thus promoting the precipitation of\r\nthe rest of the clay inasmuch as the separation takes place more readily\r\nwhere more clay is present. When all the clay is thus collected it can\r\nbe gathered on a tared filter and washed with weak brine. Pure water may\r\nnot be used because of the diffusibility of clay therein. After drying\r\nat 100° and weighing it is washed with a weak solution of ammonium\r\nchlorid until all sodium is removed. The filtrate is evaporated to\r\ndryness, ignited at low redness, and weighed. The weight of the sodium\r\nchlorid thus obtained plus the weight of the filter deducted from the\r\ntotal weight gives the weight of the clay precipitate. Whenever the clay\r\ncollected as above will not diffuse in water it may be washed with water\r\nand its weight directly obtained. An excess of iron in clay will usually\r\nallow of the above treatment.\r\n\r\n=228. Properties of Pure Clay.=—The percentage of pure clay as obtained\r\nby the procedure described is about seventy-five in the finest natural\r\nclays, forty-five in heavy clay soils, and fifteen in ordinary loamy\r\nsoils. When freshly precipitated by brine it is gelatinous resembling a\r\nmixed precipitate of iron and aluminum oxids. Its volume greatly\r\ncontracts on drying, clinging tenaciously to the filter, from which it\r\nmay be freed by moistening. On drying, it becomes hard, infriable, and\r\noften resonant. It usually possesses a dark brown tint due to iron oxid.\r\nUnder the action of water it swells up like glue, the more slowly as the\r\npercentage of iron is greater. In the dry state it adheres to the tongue\r\nwith great tenacity. According to Whitney the finest particles of\r\ncolloidal clay have a diameter of 0.0001 millimeter. With a magnifying\r\npower of 350 diameters, however, Hilgard states that no particles can be\r\ndiscerned.\r\n\r\n=229. Chemical Nature of the Fine Clay.=—The fine particles separated as\r\nabove consist essentially of hydrous aluminum silicate or kaolinite. It\r\ndoubtless contains, however, other colloids or hydrogels whose\r\nabsorptive powers are similar to those of clay. It appears also to\r\ncontain sometimes free aluminum hydroxid, and colloidal ferric hydroxid,\r\nand amorphous zeolitic compounds.\r\n\r\nWhile the most careful mechanical separation can give at best only\r\napproximately the really plastic kaolinite substance, yet it is far\r\ncloser than that attained by determination of total alumina with boiling\r\nsulfuric acid. By the latter treatment all the lime-kaolinite particles\r\nare decomposed and the method does not lead to even an approximate\r\nestimate of the soil’s plasticity.\r\n\r\n=230. Separation of the Fine Sediments.=—The sediments remaining after\r\nthe separation of the clay and fine silt are ready for separation in the\r\nchurn elutriator. The apparatus mounted, as already described, is\r\nbrought into use by beginning with a low velocity of the water in the\r\nupright tube. The rate of flow should be set at from 0.25 millimeter to\r\n0.50 millimeter per second, and the churn put in motion.\r\n\r\nWhen the elutriating tube is partly full of water the sediments should\r\nbe poured in from a small beaker which is perfectly cleaned by means of\r\na washing flask. The stopper and delivery tube of the elutriator are\r\nthen put in place. The rate of flow should be so regulated that the\r\nsediments shall have had a few seconds of subsidence before the water is\r\nwithin thirty millimeters of the top. At this point the required\r\nvelocity for the first sedimentation should be turned on; _viz._, 0.25\r\nmillimeter per second. At first the sediment passes off rapidly and the\r\nwater in the elutriator is distinctly turbid. This excess of turbidity\r\nceases in a few hours and then some attention is necessary in order to\r\ndetermine when the process is complete. In fact it never is completely\r\nfinished, but where no more than one milligram of silt comes off with\r\none liter of water it may be said to be practically done. The time\r\nrequired for the first operation varies from fifteen to ninety hours.\r\nDownward currents in the elutriator are likely to form in spite of all\r\nprecautions, and floccules of silt adhere to its walls. These should be\r\ndetached from time to time with a feather in order to bring them again\r\nin contact with the churn.\r\n\r\nHilgard has found that, practically, 0.25 millimeter per second is about\r\nthe lowest velocity available within reasonable limits of time, and that\r\nby successively doubling the velocities up to sixty-four millimeters a\r\ndesirable ascending series of sediments is obtained; provided always,\r\nthat a proper previous preparation has been given to the soil or clay.\r\nIt would seem that according to the prescription given above for the\r\npreliminary sedimentation, no sediment corresponding to 0.25 millimeter\r\nvelocity should remain with the coarser portion. That such is\r\nnevertheless always the case, often to a large percentage, emphasizes\r\nthe difficulty, or rather impossibility, of entirely preventing or\r\ndissolving the coalescence of these fine grain sizes by hand stirring,\r\nas in beaker elutriation. It is only by such energetic motion as is\r\nabove prescribed that this can be fully accomplished, and the delivery\r\nof 0.25 and 0.50 millimeter hydraulic value really exhausted.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to run off the upper third of the column at intervals of\r\nfifteen to twenty minutes by temporarily increasing the velocity. Recent\r\nsediments, river alluvium, etc., are more easily separated than soils of\r\nmore ancient formation. The second, third, etc., separations are\r\nnaturally accomplished in much less time than the first. The respective\r\nvelocities of the separations should be 0.25 millimeter, 0.50\r\nmillimeter, one millimeter, two millimeters, four millimeters, eight\r\nmillimeters, sixteen millimeters, thirty-two millimeters, and sixty-four\r\nmillimeters a second. Below a velocity of four millimeters a second the\r\nmechanical stirrer is indispensable. Above this velocity the current of\r\nwater in the conical base will be sufficient to bring the desired\r\nparticles into the ascending column. At this velocity also a smaller\r\nelutriating tube having one-half or one-quarter the cross-section of the\r\nfirst may be employed to hasten the operation and diminish the quantity\r\nof water required. The quantity of water required for a complete\r\nseparation is from 100 to 120 liters. Any soft water free of organic\r\nmatter may be used, but distilled water is best. Hard water should be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThe mean time required for the different separations is as follows: 0.25\r\nmillimeter hydraulic value, thirty-five hours; 0.50 millimeter hydraulic\r\nvalue, twenty hours; one millimeter hydraulic value, seven and a half\r\nhours; two to sixty-four millimeters hydraulic value, eight hours. With\r\nproper arrangements for night work, an analysis may be finished in three\r\nor four days not counting the time required for the previous separation\r\nof the clay.\r\n\r\n=231. Weighing the Sediments.=—The sediments should be dried at the same\r\ntemperature used for drying the soils. Hilgard dries both at 100°. Great\r\ncare should be used in weighing the exceedingly hygroscopic clay\r\nsediments. In the case of the sediment of 0.25 millimeter hydraulic\r\nvalue it is allowed to subside as much as possible and after removing\r\nthe supernatant water the residue, twenty-five to fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters, is evaporated in a platinum dish and weighed therein. The\r\nwater can be completely decanted from the other sediments, and they can\r\nbe dried and weighed without any unusual precautions.\r\n\r\nThe loss in the separation of clays and subsoils containing but little\r\norganic matter is usually from 1.5 to 2 per cent. This loss is partly\r\ndue to the fine silt which comes off during the whole of the process and\r\nwhich is lost in the decanted waters of the sediments of 0.25\r\nmillimeters hydraulic value and above. The procedures indicated above\r\nare not strictly applicable to soils rich in humus and other organic\r\nmatters, but the destruction of these matters by ignition leaves the\r\nresidual soil in a condition wholly unfit for sedimentary separation.\r\n\r\n=232. Classification of Results.=—A convenient method of stating the\r\nresults of an analysis may be seen from the following classification.\r\nThe percentage obtained for each of the classes is to be entered in the\r\ncolumn provided for that purpose.\r\n\r\n                No.    Names of Silt     Diameter of  Velocity of\r\n                          Classes.        grains in     current     Per\r\n                                         millimeters. millimeters  cent.\r\n                                                       hydraulic\r\n                                                         value.\r\n Sieves.         1.

Naturally the actual size of the particles\r\nmay vary in each class within the extreme limits of the diameter next\r\nabove and below. It is not easy to indicate in popular language\r\ndistinctions not popularly made but the grades of particles designated\r\nby the names grits, sand and silt, may serve, at least, to establish\r\nuniformity of expression. The term grits is thus applied to all grains\r\nabove one millimeter in diameter up to gravel. Below one millimeter down\r\nto 0.1 millimeter may be called sand and below that silt may designate\r\nthe particles down to an impalpable powder.\r\n\r\n=233. Influence of Size of Tube.=—The diameter of the elutriating tube\r\nexerts a sensible influence on the character of the sediments. The\r\nfriction against the sides of a small tube is comparatively greater than\r\nin a large tube. Strictly speaking, no class of sediments strictly\r\ncorresponds to the hydraulic value calculated from the cross section of\r\nthe tube and the quantity of water supplied thereto. The sediments\r\ncorrespond actually to higher velocities, due to the fact that the\r\nlateral friction causes a more rapid flow in the center of the water\r\ncolumn. This may be demonstrated by slightly diminishing the velocity\r\nwhile a sediment is copiously discharging. The turbid column then\r\nremains stationary while clear water is running off.\r\n\r\n=234. Statement of Results.=—A complete silt analysis of a soil,\r\nconducted by the method of Hilgard, depends largely for its practical\r\nvalue on an intelligible tabulation. The method of collating results is\r\nillustrated in the table of analyses of Mississippi soils shown on page\r\n237.\r\n\r\nThe character of the soils entering into the given analyses is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nNos. 248, 206, 209, 397, 219, belong to the end of the drift period.\r\n\r\nNo. 230 is one of the two chief varieties of soils occurring in what is\r\nknown as the flat-woods, a level surface bordering on the cretaceous\r\narea, having lower tertiary clays near the surface.\r\n\r\nNo. 165 is a light soil which occurs in the former in irregular strips\r\nand patches, is easily tilled, absorbs rain water readily, but is\r\nsubject to drought and does not hold manure.\r\n\r\n            SILT ANALYSES OF MISSISSIPPI SOILS AND SUBSOILS.\r\n\r\n

The soil is so light\r\nthat the finer particles of it are carried away by high winds.\r\n\r\nNos. 206 and 209 are typical of the soils producing the long-leaf pine.\r\nThis soil is much improved by an admixture of the subsoil No. 209, which\r\nenables it to hold manure.\r\n\r\nNo. 219 is a cotton upland soil of the best quality, found in Western\r\nMississippi and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nNo. 397 is the same soil of a second rate quality. These lands are\r\neasily washed into gullies on account of their lack of perviousness to\r\nwater. They also easily swell up in contact with water, and become\r\nthereby readily diffused. The denudations produced by heavy rains are\r\nrapidly destroying the lands covered by these soils.\r\n\r\nNo. 173 is a sedimentary or residual subsoil of the cretaceous prairies\r\nof Northeastern Mississippi, forming a stratum from three to seven feet\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nNo. 230 is a residual soil which is formed by the disintegration of the\r\nold tertiary clays. It yields good crops only in very favorable years,\r\nand is easily injured both by wet and dry seasons.\r\n\r\nNo. 246 is a soil of the same origin, but is more easily tilled than the\r\nforegoing, does not crack, but becomes very hard when dried slowly. Its\r\nsuperiority to the former soil as regards tillage consists in the\r\npresence of the large amount of iron and lime.\r\n\r\nNo. 196 is a typical heavy clay soil; is better suited for the potter\r\nthan the farmer. It cracks on drying, whence its popular name. On the\r\naccession of rain the edges of these cracks crumble and fall, until\r\nfinally the lumpy surface is produced which is locally known as hog\r\nwallows.\r\n\r\nNo. 390, the richest soil of the Yazoo Bottom, seems to have a physical\r\ncomposition like the preceding one. Its superiority is due not only to\r\nthe increased quantity of plant food which it contains, but to its\r\nproperty of crumbling on rapid drying. Even when plowed wet, on drying\r\neach clod crumbles into a loose pile resembling buck-shot; whence its\r\nname. It is strongly calcareous.\r\n\r\nAs comparative data, are added the soils 365, 377, and 395, representing\r\nalluvial deposits, and two deposits from the Delta of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n=235.

Osborne examined a\r\nsample of clay by his method after previous boiling for twenty-three\r\nhours. When the sediments were examined by the microscope they were\r\nfound to contain many aggregations of particles which broke into dust\r\nunder the pressure of the thin glass slide-cover. These sediments were\r\nthen gently crushed in the beaker with the help of a soft rubber stopper\r\nwith a glass rod for a handle, the grinding together of the particles\r\nbeing, as much as possible, avoided. This pestling was continued with\r\nclear water as long as it occasioned turbidity. Comparison of the\r\nanalyses shows that practically identical results were obtained on this\r\nsoil whether it was boiled or not and indicates that the sediments are\r\nreduced to their elements by gentle pestling alone. For such soils,\r\ntherefore, it is demonstrated that pestling is a much safer treatment\r\nthan boiling. The same remark may be applied to the fertile prairie soil\r\nof Mercer County, Illinois, where boiling proved quite insufficient and\r\nin which the pestling process proved completely successful. The general\r\nconclusions arrived at from the results obtained by Osborne are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. On sands and silts of pure quartz or similar resistant material\r\nHilgard’s method and beaker elutriation give practically identical\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n2. With coarse sands and silts upon whose grains finer matter has been\r\ncemented by silicates, etc., and with soils containing soft slaty\r\ndetritus, the churn elutriator with preliminary boiling may give results\r\ntoo low for the coarse and too high for the finer grades. In these cases\r\nbeaker elutriation with pestling yields more correct figures.\r\n\r\n3. Some loamy soils containing no large amount of clay or of extremely\r\nfine silt, as well as prairie soils rich in humus, cannot be suitably\r\ndisintegrated by twenty-four hours’ boiling, but are readily reduced by\r\npestling.\r\n\r\n4. Beaker elutriation preceded by sifting, gives results in five or six\r\nhours with use of two to three gallons of pure water, which, in churn\r\nelutriation, require several days and consume eight to ten gallons of\r\npure water.\r\n\r\n5. Hilgard found that practically 0.25 millimeter is about the lowest\r\nvelocity of water current per second available within reasonable limits\r\nof time in his elutriator. Such a current carries over particles up to\r\n0.015 millimeter diameter and hence the silts of less dimensions cannot\r\nbe conveniently separated by churn elutriation. In beaker elutriation\r\nthere is no difficulty in making good separations at 0.01 millimeter and\r\nat 0.005 millimeter.\r\n\r\n6. Beaker elutriation requires no tedious boiling or preliminary\r\ntreatment and with careful pestling of the sediments gives, we believe,\r\nas nearly as possible, a good separation of adhering particles and at\r\nevery stage of the process carries with it, in the constant use of the\r\nmicroscope, the means of testing the accuracy of its work and of\r\nobserving every visible peculiarity of the soil. It is not claimed that\r\npestling may not easily go too far, but in any case a good judgment may\r\nbe formed of its effects and of the extent to which it is desirable to\r\ncarry it.\r\n\r\n7. In beaker elutriation the flocculation of particles occasions little\r\ninconvenience and does not impair the accuracy of the results.\r\n\r\n=236. Comparison of the Osborne with the Schloesing\r\nMethod.=—Schloesing’s method has been compared by Osborne[155] with the\r\nbeaker method of elutriation with the following results:\r\n\r\n                          SCHLOESING’S METHOD.\r\n\r\n                                               Per cent.\r\n                Calcium carbonate                   4.20\r\n                Sand                               64.91\r\n                Clay                               22.65\r\n                Humus                               none\r\n                Loss on ignition                    6.60\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BY THE DIRECT BEAKER METHOD.\r\n\r\n                                               Per cent.\r\n                Above 0.25 millimeter diameter      1.02\r\n                0.25–0.05 millimeter diameter       0.76\r\n                0.05–0.01 millimeter diameter      20.95\r\n                Below 0.01 millimeter diameter     71.01\r\n                Loss on ignition                    6.60\r\n\r\nIt is seen by the above that there is little agreement between the\r\nresults of the two methods.\r\n\r\nWith the prairie soil from Mercer County, Ill., the following results\r\nwere obtained working on the original sample and the sand separated by\r\nthe Schloesing process:\r\n\r\n                         SCHLOESING’S METHOD.\r\n\r\n                                        Per cent.\r\n                      Calcium carbonate      0.88\r\n                      Humus                  1.57\r\n                      Loss at 150° C.        4.42\r\n                      Sand                  82.86\r\n                      Clay                   7.86\r\n                                            —————\r\n                                            97.59\r\n\r\n                             BEAKER METHOD.\r\n\r\n                                                         Original\r\n                                     Schloesing’s sand.    soil.\r\n                                     Dried at\r\n                                      150°C.,  Ignited,  Ignited,\r\n                                     per cent. per cent. per cent.\r\n      Above 0.25 millimeter diameter      0.12      0.10      0.92\r\n      0.25–0.05 millimeter diameter       3.58      3.55      2.89\r\n      0.05–0.01 millimeter diameter      42.69     41.87     42.86\r\n      0.01–0 millimeter diameter         23.66   20.47 }     31.44\r\n      Clay                               12.81   10.14 }\r\n      Clay                                                    7.40\r\n      Loss on ignition                              6.73     14.49\r\n                                         —————     —————    ——————\r\n                                         82.86     82.86    100.00\r\n\r\nOsborne says the above figures indicate that the treatment with acid has\r\ndisintegrated the particles of less than 0.01 millimeter diameter so\r\nthat one-third of this portion appears as clay, according to the Hilgard\r\nmethod of estimating clay, which is the one employed.\r\n\r\nAs to the humus it may be noted that loss in the analysis by\r\nSchloesing’s method; _viz._, 2.41 per cent, plus loss at 150° = 4.42 per\r\ncent, plus humus found = 1.57 per cent, plus carbon dioxid (⁴⁴⁄₅₆ of\r\n0.88 =) 0.69 per cent amounts to 9.09 per cent, while the loss on\r\nignition which represents humus, carbon dioxid and water is 14.49 Per\r\ncent. The 5.40 per cent difference must evidently be, for the most part,\r\nhumus which has escaped estimation by the Schloesing method, having been\r\ndistributed among the sand and clay.\r\n\r\n=237. The Mechanical Determination of Clay.=—Schloesing’s method for the\r\nseparation of the clay as stated by Osborne[156] is essentially one of\r\nsubsidence for twenty hours from a volume of from 200 to 250 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, but of no specified height. Hilgard’s conventional\r\nmethod requires the same time and a height of solution of 200\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\nSuch methods of separation assume, first, that most of the sand and,\r\nsecond, that little of the clay shall settle within the fixed time. That\r\nboth of these assumptions are fallacious, the following experiments\r\nshow. The clay obtained by twenty hours subsidence from thirty grams of\r\nbrick clay is suspended in four liters of distilled water and allowed to\r\nsettle out completely, which requires several days. The water is then\r\ndecanted so as to remove all soluble matters, the jar again filled with\r\ndistilled water, and the clay and fine sand allowed to settle again for\r\nseveral days. The upper three-quarters of the liquid are then decanted\r\nand made up to a volume of four liters, and this is allowed to stand\r\nseveral days, when a considerable sediment forms. A decantation is again\r\nmade as before. The operations are repeated until the clay water has\r\nbeen so far freed from the clay as to become opalescent; then it first\r\nceases to deposit any appreciable sediment. A microscopic examination of\r\nthe several sediments thus collected shows them all to contain particles\r\nof sand. It appears, therefore, that only after the liquid containing\r\nthe clay has become opalescent does it cease to deposit fine particles\r\nof sand as well as of clay.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the character of the true clay itself is so changed under\r\ncertain conditions that it loses the property of remaining in prolonged\r\nsuspension in water.\r\n\r\nA sample of clay which has been freed from particles of sand exceeding\r\n0.005 millimeter diameter is suspended in water and precipitated from it\r\nby freezing. It is then washed by decantation with alcohol and dried in\r\nthe air. A portion of this clay is shaken with water and allowed to\r\nstand a few hours, during which time the greater part of it has settled.\r\nAfter decanting the water and suspended clay and repeating this process\r\na few times, a very considerable part of the clay is left which will\r\nsubside completely through 100 millimeters in a few hours. After\r\nstanding under water for several months, only a small part of the clay\r\nhas regained the quality of prolonged suspension. It has been found,\r\nhowever, that if this clay be pestled, this quality of prolonged\r\nsuspension is restored to it to a very considerable degree.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that conventional methods depending on simple\r\nsubsidence can give no accurate results because the ever varying amounts\r\nof finest sand and clay in different soils yield variable mixtures of\r\nthe two when subjected to any simple course of treatment by elutriation\r\nand subsidence.\r\n\r\nThe method of persistent pestling and repeated subsidences and\r\ndecantations continued until no further separation can be effected,\r\nalthough extremely tedious, is the only one which has so far yielded\r\neven approximately good separations on any of the clayey soils examined\r\nby Osborne.\r\n\r\nA single subsidence of the clay water for twenty-four hours will free it\r\nfrom all particles of sand having a diameter greater than 0.005\r\nmillimeter, but in many cases a considerable amount of finer sand will\r\nremain in suspension for many hours or days.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the sediment formed during the twenty-four hours\r\nsubsidence will not be free from clay, as may be easily seen by\r\nsuspending it in water a second time and allowing it to stand again for\r\ntwenty-four hours. Both Hilgard and Schloesing direct attention to these\r\ndefects, but assume that they do not usually influence the results to a\r\nsufficient extent to deprive them of value. In many cases this is\r\nundoubtedly true, as, for example, in such soils as that from the garden\r\nof the Experiment Station, at New Haven, in which there is but little\r\nclay and fine sand; but in soils of the opposite character, as in the\r\nNorth Haven brick clay where exact separations are most desirable, a\r\nvery considerable error is thus inevitably encountered.\r\n\r\n=238. Effect of Boiling on the Texture of Clayey Soils.=—Most\r\ninvestigators who have worked upon mechanical soil analysis advise\r\nboiling with water in order to detach clay and sand from each other and\r\nmake a good separation of the several mechanical elements practicable or\r\npossible. In general, however, the instructions as to the time and\r\nmanner of boiling are rather indefinite, and no definite research as to\r\nthe effects of this treatment has been undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe practice of Hilgard, to boil twenty-four hours or even longer in\r\ncase of adhesive clays, according to Osborne[157] appears to be\r\nobjectionable in view of the dehydration and change of physical\r\nproperties known to occur in case of many hydroxids, especially those of\r\niron and aluminum, which may be present in the soil. It is a familiar\r\nfact that the hydroxids above named and many other amorphous substances\r\nwhen precipitated from cold solutions are more bulky and less easily\r\nwashed upon a filter than when thrown down hot. It is also well known\r\nthat their properties are considerably changed by warming or boiling\r\nwith water. Heating with water to boiling for some hours or days\r\ngradually converts the bulky brown-red ferric hydroxid, which when\r\nprecipitated cold and air-dried for eighteen days, contains thirty-eight\r\nper cent of water, into a much denser, bright red substance containing\r\nbut two per cent of water. St. Gilles has also observed the partial\r\ndehydration of aluminum hydroxid from Al₂O₃.5H₂O to Al₂O₃.2H₂O by\r\nprolonged boiling.\r\n\r\nThe hydrate of silica and the highly hydrated silicates are most\r\nprobably affected in a similar manner, and if such be the case, boiling\r\nwould evidently change the constitution of clay in a very essential\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe following experiments throw light on this subject:\r\n\r\nTen grams of North Haven brick clay were boiled continuously for nine\r\ndays with about 700 cubic centimeters of distilled water, in a glass\r\nflask of one liter capacity and furnished with a reflux condenser.\r\nFifteen grams were boiled in the same manner for eight and one-half\r\ndays. When the boiling was concluded, the soil was found to have assumed\r\na granular condition, the clay and fine sand being collected into a mass\r\nof small grains resembling coarse sand and settling rapidly. One portion\r\nthus boiled was elutriated by the beaker method, the other by Hilgard’s.\r\nThe pestle was not used on either of those portions as it was desired to\r\ndetermine simply the effect of prolonged boiling. The separations thus\r\naccomplished are here compared with the elutriations of the same soil\r\nboiled twenty-three hours and of the pestled but unboiled soil.\r\n\r\n                  Hilgard elutriation.

If ebullition for eight\r\nor nine days reduces clay from ten to two per cent, increasing the\r\n0.05–0.01 millimeter diameter grades by six per cent, it is evident that\r\nboiling for one day or a shorter time becomes a questionable treatment.\r\n\r\nFurther experiments[158] made by boiling clay in a platinum vessel with\r\na platinum condenser showed that this precipitation of the clay was\r\nlargely if not wholly due to the salts extracted from the soil.\r\n\r\nWhen the clay has once been converted into the granular condition,\r\nconsiderable difficulty is experienced in restoring it to the state in\r\nwhich it is capable of prolonged suspension in water.\r\n\r\nThe results of the studies herewith reported may be summed up as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. The Berlin-Schöne method of elutriation gives fairly correct\r\nseparations with sandy soils containing little clay or matters finer\r\nthan 0.01 millimeter diameter, but on soils of fine texture, as loams\r\nrich in humus and clays, it gives results which are grossly inaccurate,\r\nthe error on single grades amounting to from eight to fourteen per cent.\r\n\r\n2. In respect of rapidity, economy of time, and ease of operation, the\r\nSchöne elutriation has no advantage over the beaker method.\r\n\r\n3. Schloesing’s method on its mechanical side makes no satisfactory\r\nseparations, and the chemical treatment it employs is liable to alter\r\nseriously the texture of the soil.\r\n\r\n4. The determination of clay from a single subsidence from any\r\nconventional depth or volume of water, or for any conventional time, is\r\nnot a process certain to effect even a roughly approximate separation of\r\nthe finest quartz grains from true clay.\r\n\r\n5. Boiling with water must be rejected as a treatment preliminary to\r\nmechanical analysis, because it not only abrades and reduces the coarser\r\nsediments, but may dehydrate and coagulate the true clay and thus alter\r\nessentially the texture and grain of the soil.\r\n\r\n=239. General Conclusions.=—The methods of Hilgard and Osborne have been\r\ngiven in detail and largely in the descriptive language used by the\r\nauthors. The other methods of elutriation in use in other countries have\r\nalso been described. For practical use the methods of Hilgard and\r\nOsborne are to be preferred to all others. For simplicity and speed the\r\nOsborne method has the preference over the Hilgard. For rigid control of\r\nthe work the Hilgard method is to be preferred. The effect of long\r\nboiling on clay pointed out by Osborne would suggest that the boiling\r\nprocess preliminary to the Hilgard method be made as short as possible.\r\nIt would seem that the churn attrition in the Hilgard method might well\r\nbe regarded as a substitute for the soft pestling of the Osborne\r\nprocess, and any prolonged boiling in the former method might be safely\r\nomitted. When carefully carried out, the results of the Hilgard and\r\nOsborne method are fairly comparable.\r\n\r\n=240. Distribution of Soil Ingredients.=—The determination of the\r\ndistribution of the soil ingredients in the sediments obtained in silt\r\nanalysis is illustrated by the following table:[159]\r\n\r\n

the above analyses that the clay is by far the richest\r\nin mineral constituents, of all the ingredients separated in silt\r\nanalysis, the amount in the clay being more than twice that of all the\r\nothers combined. Its volatile matter is also the largest. The large\r\namount of soda, however, is probably in part due to the sodium chlorid\r\nused in the precipitation of the diffused clay. The following points in\r\nregard to the distribution of the different ingredients are instructive:\r\n\r\n1. The iron and alumina exist in almost identical relative proportions\r\nin each sediment, making it probable that they are in some way\r\ndefinitely correlated.\r\n\r\n2. Potash and magnesia also exist in almost the same quantities, and\r\ntheir ratio to each other in all the sediments being almost constant\r\nseems to indicate that they occur combined, perhaps in some zeolitic\r\nsilicate which may be a source of supply to plants.\r\n\r\n3. Manganese exists only in the clay, a mere trace being found in the\r\nnext sediment.\r\n\r\n4. The lime appears to have disappeared in the clay, having probably\r\nbeen largely dissolved in the form of carbonate by the large quantity of\r\nwater used in elutriation. Its increase in the coarser portions may be\r\nowing to its existence in a crystallized form not so readily soluble.\r\n\r\n5. In a summary of the ingredients, it is seen that there is a loss in\r\npotash, magnesia and lime in the sediments as compared with the original\r\nsoil; and this loss is doubtless due to the solution of these bodies in\r\nthe water of elutriation.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy fact shown in this table is the rapid decrease of\r\nacid-soluble matter in the coarser sediments; even what is dissolved\r\nfrom so fine a sediment as 1.0 millimeter hydraulic value, equal to a\r\ndiameter of 0.04 millimeter, is in this case a negligible quantity. This\r\nsuggests forcibly the inutility of introducing into chemical soil\r\nanalysis, grains of as large a size as will pass a sieve of one\r\nmillimeter aperture. The hydraulic value of these grains would be\r\nsomewhere between 150 and 200 millimeters per second. While the exact\r\nresults of the above analysis may not be applicable to all soils, yet\r\nthe range is so wide that the systematic exclusion from chemical\r\nanalysis of inert material, by means of preliminary mechanical\r\nseparation, seems likely to lead to important improvements in the\r\ninterpretation of the results.\r\n\r\n=241. Percentage of Silt Classes in Different Soils.=—The adaptation of\r\na soil to different crops depends largely on the sizes of the particles\r\ncomposing it and consequently on the relative percentages of the silt\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the mechanical analysis of some markedly\r\ndifferent types of subsoils:[160]\r\n\r\n  Diameter,   Conventional        Truck\r\n millimeters.    names.            and                   Grass\r\n                           Early  small                   and\r\n                           truck. fruit.

Description of the Soils.=—Number one represents the very early\r\ntruck lands of southern Maryland. It is a light yellow sand, belonging\r\nto the Columbia terrace formation. Under an intense system of\r\ncultivation and heavy manuring with organic matter, good crops of garden\r\nvegetables are produced which mature very early, at least ten days or\r\ntwo weeks before the crops from any other part of the state. Under the\r\nprevailing meteorological and cultural conditions this soil maintains\r\nabout five or six per cent of moisture, while a heavier wheat and grass\r\nsoil maintains from twelve to twenty per cent. The truck soil is so\r\nloose and open in texture that the rain-fall passes through it very\r\nreadily, and it is undoubtedly owing to this drier soil that the plant\r\nis forced to the early maturity which secures it from competition from\r\nother parts of the State and insures a good market price.\r\n\r\nNumber two represents the later truck and fruit lands of southern\r\nMaryland. These lands contain rather more clay than those just\r\ndescribed; they are somewhat heavier and closer in texture, and are\r\nrather more retentive of moisture. This land gives a larger yield per\r\nacre than the one just described, and in every way crops make a more\r\nvigorous growth and development, but the crop is about a week or ten\r\ndays later in maturing, and for this reason it brings a lower price in\r\nthe market. It is much better land than number one for small fruit and\r\npeaches. These lands are altogether too light in texture for the\r\nprofitable production of wheat, and it would cost altogether too much to\r\nimprove them so that even a moderate yield of wheat could be obtained.\r\n\r\nNumber three is a tobacco land of southern Maryland. The finest tobacco\r\nlands of this locality come between the truck and wheat lands in\r\ntexture, and contain from ten to twenty per cent of clay. The lighter\r\nthe texture of the soil and the less clay it contains, the less tobacco\r\nit will yield per acre, but the finer the texture of the leaf. The\r\ntobacco yields more per acre on the heavier wheat soils, but the leaf is\r\ncoarse and sappy and cures green and does not take on color. It brings a\r\nvery low price in the market and does not pay for cultivation. The crop\r\non the lighter lands is of much finer quality; there is a smaller yield\r\nper acre but the leaf takes on a fine color in curing, and brings a much\r\nbetter price per pound. Wheat is commonly raised on these tobacco lands\r\nto get advantage of the high manuring, and because the rotation is\r\nbetter for the land than where tobacco is grown continuously on the same\r\nsoil. The finest tobacco lands are, however, too light in texture for\r\nthe profitable production of wheat. These lands belong to the neocene\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nNumber four is a type of the wheat lands of southern Maryland. These\r\nlands represent soil of about the lightest texture upon which wheat can\r\nbe economically produced under the climatic conditions which there\r\nprevail. They contain from eighteen to twenty-five per cent of clay, and\r\nare much more retentive of moisture than the best tobacco lands. This\r\ntype is about the limit of profitable wheat production. These soils will\r\nmaintain about twelve per cent of water during the dry season. Garden\r\ntruck is so late in maturing on these lands that there is often a glut\r\nin the market when the crop matures, and the crops often do not pay the\r\ncost of transportation. The lands are too light in texture for a\r\npermanent grass sod. They belong to the neocene formation.\r\n\r\nNumber five represents the heavier wheat lands of southern Maryland,\r\nbelonging probably to a different horizon of the neocene formation and\r\ncontaining about thirty per cent of clay. This soil is much more\r\nretentive of moisture and produces very much larger crops of wheat than\r\nthe last sample. It is strong enough and sufficiently retentive of\r\nmoisture to make good grass lands. It is too close in texture and too\r\nretentive of moisture for the production of a high grade of tobacco, or\r\nto be profitable for market truck.\r\n\r\nNumber six is from a heavy limestone soil of lower Helderberg formation.\r\nIt is a strong and fertile wheat and grass land.\r\n\r\n=243. Interpretation of Silt Analysis.=—The primary conceptions upon\r\nwhich the interpretation of the mechanical analysis is based may be\r\nbriefly stated as follows:[161] The circulation of water in the soil is\r\ndue to gravity, or the weight of water, acting with a constant force to\r\npull the water downward, and also to surface tension, or the contracting\r\npower of the free surface of water (water-air surface), which tends to\r\nmove the water either up or down, or in any direction, according to\r\ncircumstances. There is a large amount of space between the grains in\r\nall soils in which water may be held, ranging from about thirty per cent\r\nin light sandy lands to sixty-five or seventy per cent in stiff clay\r\nsoils. The relative rate of movement of water through a given depth of\r\nsoil will depend upon how much space there is in the soil; upon how much\r\nthis space is divided up, _i. e._, upon how many grains there are per\r\nunit volume of soil; upon the arrangement of the grains of sand and\r\nclay; and upon how this skeleton structure is filled in and modified\r\nwith organic matter. It also appears that the ordinary manures and\r\nfertilizers change this surface tension, or pulling power of water; that\r\nthey also change the arrangement of the grains, and consequently the\r\ntexture or structure of the soil may be changed and the relation of the\r\nsoil to water, through the effect of the ordinary manures and\r\nfertilizers in causing flocculation or the reverse.\r\n\r\n=244. Number of Particles in a Given Weight of Soil.=—The approximate\r\nnumber of particles in the soil can be calculated from the results of\r\nthe mechanical analysis by the following formula:[162]\r\n\r\n                        (_a_/((π(_d_)³ω)/6)) ÷ A\r\n\r\nWhere _a_ is the weight of each group of particles, _d_ the mean\r\ndiameter of the particles in the several groups in centimeters, ω is the\r\nspecific gravity of the soil, and A is the total weight of soil. For the\r\nspecific gravity of ordinary soils, the constant 2.65 may be used.\r\n\r\nIn using the formula the per cents are expressed as grams. Thus, if\r\nthere were twenty per cent of silt, this would be taken as twenty grams,\r\nand if the results of the analysis added up ninety-seven per cent the\r\nwhole weight of soil would be taken as ninety-seven grams. The diameter\r\n_d_ is taken as the mean for the extreme diameters taken for any group,\r\nfor instance, for the silt this would be 0.003 centimeter, which is\r\nassumed to be the diameter of the particles in that group. This formula\r\ncan only give approximate values, as the number of separations in a silt\r\nanalysis must necessarily be small, amounting usually to not more than\r\neight or ten grades, on account of the time and labor required for\r\ncloser separations. There is relatively rather a wide range in the\r\ndiameters of grains within any one of these grades, and absolute values\r\ncould not be expected without a vast number of separations, so that all\r\nthe grains in each group would be almost exactly of the same size.\r\n\r\nThe clay group has relatively the widest limits, which is unfortunate,\r\nas this is the most important of all the groups on account of the\r\nexceedingly small size of the particles. The figure 0.0001 millimeter is\r\ntaken as the lowest limit of the diameter of the clay particles. These\r\nparticles have been heretofore assumed to be ultra-microscopic, but by\r\nthe use of a microscope of high power with oil-immersion objective and\r\nstaining fluids, it has been possible to define the clay particles in a\r\nturbid liquid which has stood so long as to be only faintly opalescent.\r\n\r\nPending more exact measurements, the figure 0.00255 millimeter has been\r\nused as the diameter of the average sized particle in the clay group.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the approximate number of grains per gram in\r\nthe different types of subsoils calculated from the mechanical analysis\r\nof the typical soils already given:\r\n\r\n         NUMBER OF PARTICLES OF EACH CLASS IN ONE GRAM OF SOIL.\r\n ─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────\r\n   Silt classes.  │      No. 1      │            No. 2│      No. 3\r\n Diameter (_d_) in│  Early truck.   │  Truck and small│    Tobacco.\r\n   centimeters.   │                 │           fruit.│\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n 0.15             │                0│                0│                3\r\n 0.075            │               85│               34│              102\r\n 0.0375           │            5,511│            4,011│            1,900\r\n 0.0175           │           37,230│           54,610│           11,890\r\n 0.0075           │          207,500│          199,700│          267,900\r\n 0.003            │        2,073,000│        1,355,000│        8,092,000\r\n 0.00075          │       38,210,000│       35,360,000│      140,900,000\r\n 0.000255         │    1,915,000,000│    3,918,000,000│    6,637,000,000\r\n                  │    —————————————│    —————————————│    —————————————\r\n                  │    1,955,000,000│    3,954,973,355│    6,786,273,795\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n   Silt classes.  │      No. 4      │      No. 5      │      No. 6\r\n Diameter (_d_) in│     Wheat.      │Grass and wheat. │   Limestone.\r\n   centimeters.   │                 │                 │\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n 0.15             │                0│                0│               12\r\n 0.075            │              726│                4│               60\r\n 0.0375           │            8,273│              181│              157\r\n 0.0175           │           32,340│            5,556│            1,456\r\n 0.0075           │          554,100│          202,600│          125,900\r\n 0.003            │        3,962,000│       10,670,000│        8,231,000\r\n 0.00075          │       73,990,000│      154,900,000│      199,900,000\r\n 0.000255         │   10,150,000,000│   14,570,000,000│   19,430,000,000\r\n                  │   ——————————————│   ——————————————│   ——————————————\r\n                  │   10,228,547,439│   14,735,778,341│   19,638,258,585\r\n ─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────\r\n\r\n=245. Estimation of the Surface Area of Soil Particles.=—The approximate\r\nextent of surface area of the soil grains in one gram of soil can be\r\ncalculated from the foregoing by the following formula:[163]\r\n\r\n                               π(_d_)²_n_\r\n\r\nin which _d_ is the mean of the diameters of any group in centimeters,\r\nand _n_ is the number of particles in the group.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the approximate extent of surface area of the\r\nparticles in one gram of soil calculated from the preceding table:\r\n\r\n APPROXIMATE EXTENT IN SQUARE CENTIMETERS, OF SURFACE AREA IN ONE GRAM\r\n                                OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n                                         Soil number.\r\n                               ————— —————— —————— —————— —————— ——————\r\n Diameter, millimeters.      1         2      3      4      5      6\r\n 1.5                             0.0    0.0    0.4    0.0    0.0    0.1\r\n 0.75                            1.8    0.6    1.8   12.8    0.1    0.1\r\n 0.375                          24.3   17.7    8.4   36.5   31.0    0.7\r\n 0.175                          35.8   52.6   11.4   31.1    5.3    1.4\r\n 0.075                          21.3   35.3   47.3   97.9   35.8   22.2\r\n 0.03                          218.8   38.3  228.9  112.0  301.4  232.7\r\n 0.0075                         67.4   62.5  248.9  130.8  273.5  353.4\r\n 0.00255                       390.8  800.5 1355.0 2072.0 2976.0 3965.0\r\n                               ————— —————— —————— —————— —————— ——————\r\n         Total                 760.2 1007.5 1902.1 2493.1 3593.1 4575.3\r\n\r\n=246.

Mineralogical Examination of the Particles of Soil Obtained by\r\nMechanical Analysis.=—The principal object of the mechanical analysis of\r\nsoils as has already been set forth is the separation of the soil into\r\nportions, the particles of which have the same hydraulic value. It is\r\nevident without illustration that particles of the same hydraulic value\r\ndo not necessarily have the same size. The rate of flow of a liquid\r\ncarrying certain definite particles does not imply that these particles\r\nare of the same dimensions. Of two particles of the same size and shape,\r\nthat one which has the lower specific gravity, will be carried off at\r\nthe lower rate of flow. At the end of the operation, therefore, the\r\nseveral portions of the soil obtained will be found composed of\r\nparticles of sizes varying within certain limits, and of these particles\r\nthe larger ones will tend to be composed of minerals of lower specific\r\ngravity, and the smaller ones of minerals of higher specific gravity. Of\r\nthe same mineral substance, the particles which are most irregular,\r\nexposing for a given weight the largest surface will be found to pass\r\nover at a lower velocity than those of a more nearly spherical shape.\r\nThe same law holds good for particles falling through a liquid at rest,\r\n_i. e._, the heavier and more spherical particles, weight for weight,\r\nwill sooner reach the bottom of the containing vessel. To complete the\r\nvalue of a mechanical analysis, it becomes necessary to submit the\r\nseveral portions of soil obtained not only to a chemical but also to a\r\nmineralogical examination. Only the outlines of the methods of examining\r\nsilt separates for mineral constituents can be given here and special\r\nworks in petrography must be consulted for greater details.[164]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the methods of separation and examination from a\r\nmineralogical point of view about to be described can only be applied to\r\nsilts of the largest size. The finer silts can not be separated into\r\nportions of different specific gravities by separating liquids of\r\nvarying densities on account of the slowness with which they subside,\r\nthus tending to adhere to the sides of the separating vessels and to\r\nform floccules which are not all composed of the same kind of mineral\r\nparticles. While, therefore, these processes are more appropriately\r\ndescribed in connection with the silts obtained by hydraulic\r\nelutriation, they can be applied with greater success to the fine\r\nparticles passing the different sieves used in the preparation of the\r\nsoil for analysis or to the finely pulverized soil as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe minerals which have contributed to soil formation, moreover, are\r\nbetter preserved in the larger silt particles and therefore more easily\r\nidentified. While the desirability of securing like determinations in\r\nthe finer silts is not to be denied, in the present state of the art the\r\nanalyst must be content with the examination of the larger particles.\r\n\r\n=248. Methods of Investigation.=—The chief points to be observed in the\r\nexamination of the fine particles of soil are the following: (1) the\r\nsize and shape of the particles; (2) measurement of crystal angles; (3)\r\nseparation into classes of approximately the same specific gravity; (4)\r\nseparation by means of the magnet; (5) determination of color and\r\ntransparency; (6) determination of refractive index; (7) examination\r\nwith polarized light; (8) examination after coloring; (9) chemical\r\nseparation. For many of the optical studies above noted, it is first\r\nnecessary to prepare thin laminae of the mineral particles and properly\r\nmount them for examination. For the purposes of this manual only those\r\nprocesses will be described which are essentially connected with a\r\nproper understanding of the nature of the soil particles. For the more\r\nelaborate methods of research the analyst will consult the standard\r\nworks on mineralogy and petrography.\r\n\r\n=249. Microscopical Examination.=—The direct examination of the silt\r\nparticles with the microscope should attend the progress of separation.\r\nUnless the particles obtained have the same general appearance, the\r\nseparation is not properly carried on. Especially is the microscope\r\nuseful to determine that the value of the silt separation is not\r\nimpaired by flocculation. Unless flocculation be practically prevented\r\nduring the separation of the finest particles, many of these will be\r\nleft as aggregates to be brought over subsequently with particles of far\r\ndifferent properties. No special directions are necessary in the use of\r\nthe microscope. The silt particles are removed with a few drops of water\r\nby means of a pipette, a drop of the liquid with the suspended particles\r\nis placed on the glass, covered and examined with a convenient\r\nmagnification. A micrometer scale should be employed in order that the\r\napproximate sizes of the particles may be determined. A _camera lucida_\r\nmay also be conveniently used for the purpose of delineating the form of\r\nparticles of peculiar interest.\r\n\r\n=250. Petrographic Microscope.=—Any good microscope furnished with\r\npolarizing apparatus may be used for the examination of the silt\r\nparticles and sections. For directions in manipulating microscopes the\r\nreader is referred to works on that subject. A special form of\r\nmicroscope for petrographic work is made by Bausch and Lomb of\r\nRochester. The stand of this instrument is shown in Fig. 37. The base,\r\nupright pillars and arm are made of japanned iron. The stage is made in\r\ntwo forms, first, plain revolving, having silvered graduates at right\r\nangles and second, a mechanical stage with silvered graduations on the\r\nedge with vernier and graduations for the rectangular movements. The\r\nmirror bar is adjustable and graduated and the mirror is of large size,\r\nplane and concave. The double chambered box in the main tube carries the\r\nupper Nicol prism (analyzer). The lower Nicol prism (polarizer) is\r\nmounted in a cylindrical box beneath the stage to which it is held by a\r\nswinging arm. It is adjustable also up or down and is provided with a\r\ncompound lens for securing converged polarized light. In revolving the\r\nprism a distinct click shows the position of the crossed Nicols.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 37.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=251. Form and Dimensions of the Particles.=—In order to study the\r\ncontour of the fine silt particles, it is well to suspend them in a\r\nliquid whose refractive index is markedly lower than that of the\r\nparticles themselves, and for this purpose pure water is commonly used.\r\nCare must be taken that not too many particles are found in the drop of\r\nwater which is to be placed on the object holder and protected with a\r\nthin, even glass. The tendency to flocculation in these fine particles\r\nwill make the study of their form difficult if they are allowed to come\r\ntoo close together. The size of the particles, or linear diameter, is to\r\nbe determined by means of an eye-micrometer. This consists of a glass\r\nplate on which a millimeter scale is engraved with a diamond, or\r\nphotographed. The millimeter scale is the one usually employed, each\r\nmillimeter being divided into tenths. On microscopes designed especially\r\nfor photographic work the micrometer is fastened to the eyepiece, and so\r\nadjusted as to read from left to right, or at right angles thereto.\r\nSometimes an eyepiece-micrometer has two scales at right angles so that\r\ndimensions may be read in two directions without change. With an\r\neyepiece-micrometer, not the dimensions of the object, but those of its\r\nmagnified image are read, and the degree of magnification being known,\r\nthe actual size of the object is easily calculated. The actual\r\nmeasurements may also be obtained by placing in the field of vision, a\r\nstage-micrometer and determining directly the relation between that and\r\nthe eyepiece-scale. If, for example, the stage-micrometer is ruled to\r\n0.01 millimeter, and the eye-micrometer to 0.1 millimeter, and one\r\ndivision of the stage-rule should cover three divisions of the eye-rule,\r\nthen the one division of the eye-micrometer would correspond to an\r\nactual linear distance of 0.0033 millimeter in the object. If the two\r\nlines of division in the two micrometers do not fall absolutely\r\ntogether, the calculation may be made as follows: suppose that six\r\ndivisions, 0.6 millimeter, in the eyepiece correspond to nearly five\r\ndivisions, 0.25 millimeter, in the stage piece. To get at the exact\r\ncomparison, take ninety-six divisions of the eye-scale and they will be\r\nfound to be somewhat longer than eighty-one and somewhat shorter than\r\neighty-two divisions of the stage-scale. It follows therefore that\r\n\r\n        one division of the eye-scale >0.008438 millimeter, and\r\n         „     „     „   „   „    „   <0.008541      „      ;\r\n\r\nand, hence, one division of the eye-scale corresponds almost exactly to\r\n0.008489 linear measure.\r\n\r\n=252. Illustrations of Silt Classes.=—In figure 38 are shown the\r\nrelative sizes and usual forms of a series of silt separates made by the\r\nOsborne beaker method. The photomicrographs were made by Dr. G. L.\r\nSpencer from specimens furnished by Prof. M. Whitney.\r\n\r\nThe soil represented by the separates is from a truck farm near Norfolk,\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe particles represented in each class are not all strictly within the\r\nlimits of size described. For instance, in the largest size (No. 1) are\r\ntwo particles at least which show a diameter of more than one\r\nmillimeter. The particles in general, however, are within the limits of\r\nthe class; _viz._, one-half to one millimeter, and this general\r\nobservation is true of all the classes. In the case of the finer\r\nparticles, especially of clay, the tendency to flocculation could not be\r\novercome in the preparation of the slides for the photographic\r\napparatus. The clay particles are so fine as to present but little more\r\nthan a haze at 150 diameters of magnification. The particles seen are\r\nclearly, in most cases, aggregates of the finer clay particles. The\r\nlarger particles show the rounded appearance due to attrition and\r\nweathering. It would have been more instructive to have had the\r\nparticles of the different classes all photographed on the same scale,\r\nbut this is manifestly impossible. The lowest power which shows any of\r\nthe clay particles to advantage is at least 150 diameters, and with the\r\nlarger particles such a magnification would have been impracticable.\r\n\r\n=253. Measurement of Crystal Angles.=—The fine silt particles rarely\r\nretain sufficient crystalline shape to permit of the measurement of\r\nangles and the determination of crystalline form thereby. The rolling\r\nand attrition to which the silt particles have been subjected have, in\r\nmost cases, given to the fragments rounded or irregular forms which\r\nrender, even in the largest silts, the measurement of angles impossible.\r\nFor the methods of mounting minute crystals and the measurement of\r\nmicroscopic angles, the analyst is referred to standard works on\r\nmineralogy and petrography.\r\n\r\n=254. Determination of the Refractive Index.=—For a study of the theory\r\nof refraction, works on optics should be consulted. The general\r\nprinciples of this phenomenon which concern the determination of the\r\nrefractive power of fine earth particles are as follows: if a\r\ntransparent solid particle is observed in the microscope imbedded in a\r\nmedium of approximately the same refractive power and color, its\r\noutlines will not be clearly defined, but the imbedded particle will\r\nshow in all of its extent the highest possible translucency. If,\r\ntherefore, the form or perimeter of the particle is to be studied with\r\nas much definiteness as possible, it should be held in a medium\r\ndiffering as widely from it as possible in refractive power. For\r\nminerals, water is usually the best immersion material. On the other\r\nhand, when the internal structure of the particles is the object of the\r\nexamination, it should be imbedded in oil, resin (Canada balsam), etc.,\r\nor in some of the liquids mentioned below.\r\n\r\nIf particles of different refractive powers and the same character of\r\nsurface be studied in the same medium, they will not all appear equally\r\nsmooth on the field of the microscope. Some of the surfaces will seem\r\nsmooth and even, others will appear rough and wrinkled. Those particles\r\nwhose refractive index is equal to or less than that of the liquid\r\nappear smooth, because all the emergent light therefrom can pass at once\r\ninto the environing medium. On the other hand, the surfaces of those\r\nparticles which have a higher refractive power than the medium will\r\nappear roughened, because, on account of the unavoidable irregularities\r\non the surface, many of the emergent rays of light must strike at the\r\ncritical angle and so suffer total reflection, and consequently those\r\nportions of the surface will be less illuminated, producing the\r\nphenomenon of apparent roughness above noted. In the case of any given\r\nparticle, liquids of increasing refractive power can be successively\r\napplied until the change in the appearance of the surface of the\r\nparticle is noticed. The refractive index of the liquid being known,\r\nthat of the particle is in this way approximately to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe following liquids, having the indexes mentioned, are commonly\r\nemployed:\r\n\r\n                      Substance.                       Refractive index.\r\n Water                                                             1.333\r\n Alcohol                                                           1.365\r\n Glycerol                                                          1.460\r\n Olive oil                                                         1.470\r\n Canada balsam                                                     1.540\r\n Oil of cinnamon                                                   1.580\r\n Oil of bitter almonds                                             1.600\r\n Oil of Cassia                                                     1.606\r\n Concentrated solution of potassium and mercuric iodid             1.733\r\n Concentrated solution of barium and mercuric iodid                1.775\r\n\r\nThe solution of potassium and mercuric iodid may also be used for all\r\nrefractive indexes from 1.733 to 1.334 by proper dilution with water.\r\n\r\nThe mineral particle may also be imbedded in Canada balsam and over it a\r\ndrop of a liquid of known refractive power placed. By a few trials one\r\nof the liquids will be found having practically the refractive index of\r\nthe particle under examination.\r\n\r\n=255. Examination with Polarized Light.=—The internal structure of a\r\nmineral particle can often be determined by its deportment with\r\npolarized light. The theory of polarization is fully set forth in works\r\non optics and will not be discussed here. The principle on which the\r\nutility of polarized light in the examination of soil particles rests is\r\nfound in the information it may give in respect of crystalline\r\nstructure. The structure of mineral particles which make up the bulk of\r\nan ordinary soil is, as a rule, so thoroughly disintegrated that all\r\ntrace of its original form is lost. Some particles may exist, however,\r\nin which there is no determinable element of shape and which yet possess\r\nan internal crystalline structure which the microscope with polarized\r\nlight may be able to reveal.\r\n\r\n=256. Staining Silt Particles.=—The finer silts and clays before\r\nmicroscopic examination should be colored or stained. The methods used\r\nin staining bacteria may be employed for the clay particles.\r\n\r\nEvaporation to dryness with a solution of magenta will often impart a\r\ncolor to the clay particles which is not removed by subsequent\r\nsuspension in water. The harder and larger silt particles are not easily\r\nstained, especially if they be firm and undecomposed. On the other hand,\r\nif the particles be broken and seamed, and well decomposed, the stain\r\nwill be taken up and held firmly in the capillary fissures. Valuable\r\nindications are thus obtained respecting the nature of the silt\r\nparticles. Particles of mica, chlorite and talc are easily distinguished\r\nin this way from the firmer and less decomposed quartz grains.\r\n\r\nThe staining of the particles after ignition and treatment with acids\r\ngives better results than the direct treatment. Particles of carbonate\r\nwhich are stained with difficulty before ignition take the stain easily\r\nafterwards on account of the decomposition produced by the loss of\r\ncarbon dioxid. This is the case also with particles containing water of\r\ncomposition or crystallization.\r\n\r\n=257. Cleavage of Soil Particles.=—A microscopic examination of the\r\ncleavage of soil particles may be useful in determining their mineral\r\norigin. The course followed by cleavage lines and their mutual position\r\nis dependent on the direction in which the separation of the mineral\r\nfragment takes place. The character of the microscopic fragments\r\nproduced by crushing a soil particle is determined primarily by the\r\nsystem of crystallization to which it belongs. Perhaps the most\r\ndistinguishing cleavage marks in soil particles will be found in\r\nfragments of mica and orthoclase. These characteristic forms are shown\r\nin Figs. 39 and 40. The first (Fig. 39) shows the pinacoidal cleavage in\r\na fragment of mica. Fig. 40 illustrates the appearance of the cleavage\r\nlines in a fragment of orthoclase. Figs. 41 and 42 show the\r\ncharacteristic cleavage lines in fragments of epidote and titanite.\r\n\r\n=258. Microchemical Examination of Silt.=—The methods of quantitative\r\nchemical examination of silts will be given in another part of this\r\nmanual. Certain qualitative and microchemical tests, however, are useful\r\nin identifying silt particles. For instance, any soluble iron mineral\r\nwill be detected, even in minute quantity, by the blue coloration of the\r\nsolution produced by the addition of potassium ferrocyanid. Manganese\r\nwill be revealed by fusion with soda and saltpeter on platinum foil, in\r\nthe oxidizing flame, producing the well-known green coloration due to\r\nthe sodium manganate formed.\r\n\r\nMore valuable indications of the character of the fragments examined are\r\nobtained by microchemical processes. The best method of decomposing the\r\nsilt particles for this purpose is by treatment with hydrofluosilicic\r\nacid. When the particles are composed of silicates, pure hydrofluoric\r\nacid is to be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe method of treatment is essentially that of Boricky.[165] The slide\r\nused is protected by a film of Canada balsam, and a few of the silt\r\nparticles are placed thereon, and fixed in place by slightly warming the\r\nbalsam. Each particle is then treated with a drop of hydrofluosilicic\r\nacid, care being taken not to let the drops flow together. The acid must\r\nbe pure, leaving no residue on evaporation. The acid should be prepared\r\nby the analyst from a mixture of barium fluorid, sulfuric acid and\r\nquartz powder, or the commercial article should be purified by\r\ndistillation before using. The acid should be kept in ceresin or\r\ngutta-percha bottles and must be applied with a ceresin or gutta-percha\r\nrod. Each particle should be as completely dissolved as possible by the\r\nacid, and the rate of solution may be hastened by gentle warming,\r\nprovided the heat is not great enough to remove the balsam and allow the\r\nacid to attack the glass. The bases present in the silt particles\r\ncrystallize on drying as fluosilicates. In case of a too rapid\r\ncrystallization, the mass may be dissolved in a drop of water or of very\r\ndilute hydrofluosilicic acid, and allowed to evaporate more slowly. Some\r\nfragments need more than one treatment with acid to secure complete\r\nsolution, and particles of mica may even resist repeated applications.\r\nIn such a case the decomposition may be made in a platinum crucible with\r\nhydrofluoric acid, adding afterwards an excess of hydrofluosilicic acid\r\nand evaporating to dryness. The crystals may then be dissolved in a\r\nlittle water and a drop of the solution allowed to crystallize on the\r\nslide.\r\n\r\n=259. Special Reactions.=—The number of microchemical reactions is very\r\ngreat, but there will be given here only some of the more important for\r\nsilt identification.\r\n\r\n_Sodium._—Sodium mineral fragments dissolved in hydrofluosilicic acid\r\nand dried give the combinations shown in Fig. 43. With sodium and\r\naluminum the forms shown in Figs. 44 and 45 are obtained. With an\r\nincreasing amount of lime in the mineral, the crystals tend to become\r\nlonger. For microscopic work it is not advisable to try to produce the\r\ntetrahedral crystals of the double uranium sodium acetate because the\r\ncommercial uranium acetate often contains sodium and even the pure\r\narticle will often take up sodium from the bottles.\r\n\r\n_Potassium._—Fragments containing potash give isotropic clear cubes, or\r\noctahedra of low refracting power, or combinations of these forms with\r\neach other and with rhombic dodecahedra. These crystals have the\r\ncomposition K₂SiF₆. Their forms are shown[166] in Figs. 46 and 47. In\r\ncase much sodium be present, the first crystals obtained may be strongly\r\ndouble refractive rhombohedra, but on dissolving in water and allowing\r\nto recrystallize, the normal forms will be obtained. If the crystals be\r\ndissolved in hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, and treated with platinum\r\nchlorid, the characteristic yellow octahedral crystals of K₂PtCl₆ will\r\nbe obtained. Ammonium and cesium compounds also give this reaction.\r\n\r\n_Lithium._—When fragments containing lithium are treated with the\r\nsolvent mentioned, monoclinic crystals are produced on drying. These\r\ncrystals dissolved in sulfuric acid and freed from calcium sulfate by\r\ntreatment with potassium carbonate give aggregates of lithium carbonate\r\nresembling a snowflake. At a high temperature lithium solutions treated\r\nwith sodium phosphate give spindle-shaped crystals of lithium phosphate.\r\nThe double lithium aluminum silicofluorid is shown in Fig. 48. The ease\r\nwith which traces of lithium may be detected by the spectroscope renders\r\nunnecessary any further description of its microchemical reactions.\r\n\r\n_Calcium._—Nearly all mineral particles, save quartz grains, contain\r\ncalcium. When these particles are dissolved by treatment with\r\nhydrofluosilicic acid, they form on drying hydrated monoclinic crystals\r\nof calcium silicofluorid (CaSiF₆ + 2H₂O). These crystals assume many\r\nforms, some of which are shown in Figs. 49 and 50. These crystals are\r\neasily decomposed by sulfuric acid, the well-known long prismatic\r\ncrystals of gypsum taking their place. On treatment of silt particles\r\ncontaining lime with hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids, only a part of the\r\nlime passes into solution if the content thereof be large. Where but\r\nlittle lime is present and the sulfuric acid is in large excess, all the\r\nlime passes into solution and the characteristic gypsum crystals appear\r\nas in Fig. 51.\r\n\r\n_Magnesium._—Rhombohedral crystals of magnesium silicofluorid separate\r\nfrom the solution of particles containing magnesium in hydrofluosilicic\r\nacid. They have the composition MgSiF₆6H₂O and their common forms are\r\nshown in Fig. 52. Quite characteristic also are the crystals of struvite\r\n(NH₄MgPO₄ + 6H₂O), which are produced in a very dilute solution of the\r\nmagnesium compound first obtained by carefully adding ammonium hydroxid\r\nand chlorid until a faint alkaline reaction is produced, and then\r\nplacing a drop of dilute sodium phosphate at the edge of the solution.\r\nThe crystals should be allowed to form slowly in the cold. Their form is\r\nshown in Fig. 54.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 38. PHOTOMICROGRAPHS OF SILT PARTICLES.\r\n]\r\n\r\n      No. Diameter in mm.     Name.      Magnification.

Ammonium phosphomolybdate crystals magnified 140 diameters.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Barium._—From solution of barium bearing minerals in hydrofluosilicic\r\nacid fragments, no characteristic crystals, are obtained. Treated with\r\nhydrofluoric and sulfuric acids the barium is left as sulfate. If this\r\nsalt be dissolved in boiling oil of vitriol and a drop of the solution\r\nplaced on the slide, a mixture of rectangular tablets and St. Andrew’s\r\ncross-shaped growths will be separated before any crystals of gypsum\r\nwhich may be present appear. When strontium is present, the barium\r\nsulfate residue obtained by treatment with hydrofluoric and sulfuric\r\nacids should be fused with sodium and potassium carbonate, washed with\r\nwater until the sulfuric acid is removed, the residue dissolved in\r\nhydrochloric or nitric acids, and the solution treated with potassium\r\nchromate. Pale yellow crystals of barium chromate are thus obtained,\r\nwhich resemble in form those secured by dissolving the barium sulfate in\r\noil of vitriol. Strontium is not precipitated by this treatment. If\r\npotassium ferrocyanid be used instead of barium chromate with the\r\nhydrochloric acid solution, crystals of barium potassium ferrocyanid are\r\nformed of a bright yellow color and rhombohedric shape.\r\n\r\n_Strontium._—From a hydrofluosilicic acid solution, strontium\r\ncrystallizes in columns or tablets of the monoclinic system as strontium\r\nsilicofluorid, SrSiF₆. On treating these with sulfuric acid, rhombic\r\nplates of strontium sulfate are formed, which serve to distinguish this\r\nelement from calcium. On treatment of the particles of the original\r\nmineral with hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids, the strontium remains in\r\nthe insoluble residue. When this residue is treated with boiling oil of\r\nvitriol, rhombic plates of celestine are separated. If the residues\r\nabove mentioned be dissolved by fusion with the alkaline carbonates,\r\nwashed with water, dissolved in hydrochloric acid and treated with\r\noxalic acid, octahedral crystals of strontium oxalate are formed.\r\n\r\n_Iron._—Mineral particles containing iron give crystals, when treated as\r\nis first described above, which are fully isomorphous with those\r\nobtained from magnesium. By moistening the crystalline mass with\r\npotassium ferrocyanid, the presence of iron is at once revealed by the\r\nblue coloration produced.\r\n\r\n_Aluminum._—No crystals containing aluminum are formed from the mineral\r\nparticles containing this substance when dissolved in the solvent\r\nalready mentioned. If, however, the gelatinous mass be dissolved in a\r\nlittle sulfuric acid and a fragment of a cesium salt added, beautiful\r\ncrystals of cesium alum are obtained, illustrated in Fig. 53.\r\n\r\n_Phosphorus._—When a mineral fragment containing phosphorus is treated\r\naccording to the usual analytical methods for securing the ammonium\r\nmagnesium phosphate, crystals are obtained of the form shown in Figs. 54\r\nand 55. A phosphatic fragment of silt may be identified when soluble by\r\ntreatment with nitric acid and ammonium molybdate. On slowly drying,\r\nrhombohedral crystals are produced, yellow by reflected, and green by\r\ntransmitted light. Their form is shown in Fig. 56.\r\n\r\n=260. Petrographic Examination of Silt Particles.=—The larger silt\r\nparticles and the minute fragments of minerals in the soil can best be\r\nstudied in thin sections. For this purpose the following plan, proposed\r\nby Thoulet, may be used. Mix the soil minerals in considerable\r\nproportion—Thoulet recommends ten per cent, but a greater percentage is\r\noften better—with zinc oxid and make into a paste with sodium silicate.\r\nThe paste should be worked to the consistence of putty and then rolled\r\ninto little tablets about one-eighth of an inch thick and an inch in\r\ndiameter. After drying a day or two without heating, the tablets become\r\nhard enough to mount and grind like rock sections. These tablets are\r\nmounted in Canada balsam on glass slides and ground as thin as possible\r\nwith fine emery on the turn-table or glass plate, as rock sections are\r\ntreated. As these tablets are not as strong as rock sections usually\r\nare, they require care in this treatment. Some of the grains also are\r\napt to be torn out in the process of grinding and to compensate for this\r\nloss a number of slides should be prepared with each lot of soil\r\nminerals. When this operation has been successful, the optical\r\nproperties of the various minerals can be studied as in rock sections.\r\n\r\nAs the iron oxid contained in the soils obscures the transparency of the\r\nminerals, it is well to treat a portion of the material under\r\nexamination with hot hydrochloric acid for a short time to remove this\r\noxid and then prepare slides with the cleansed material and compare\r\nresults with the untreated. As the acid will dissolve phosphates and\r\ncarbonates, and will partly or wholly decompose some other minerals, the\r\noperator must be guided by his judgment in its use.\r\n\r\n=261. Machine for Making Mineral Sections.=—A convenient apparatus for\r\nthis purpose has been described by Williams[167] and is represented in\r\nFig. 57. It is supported on a substantial table provided underneath with\r\nelectric batteries and a motor for driving the cutting disks seen on the\r\ntop. The table is three feet six inches square and two feet nine inches\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 57.\r\n\r\n  MACHINE FOR MAKING MINERAL SECTIONS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe grinding apparatus consists of two circular disks of solid copper,\r\nnine inches in diameter, and three-eighths inch thick, which may be used\r\nalternately as different grades of emery are required. They are attached\r\neither by a screw or square socket to a vertical iron spindle which\r\nrevolves smoothly in a conical bearing. The grinding disk is surrounded\r\nwhen in use by a large cylindrical pan of tin, which is not shown in the\r\ncut, which has an opening in its center to allow of the passage of the\r\nspindle.\r\n\r\nThe sawing apparatus consists of a horizontal countershaft placed on a\r\ndifferent part of the table and connected with the motor by a separate\r\nbelt. It carries at one end a vertical wheel of solid emery, and at the\r\nother an attachment, level-table and guide for the diamond-saw. A small\r\nwater-can with spout, not shown in the cut, is suspended over the edge\r\nof the table to keep the saw wet when it is in use.\r\n\r\nThe machine is very conveniently driven by a storage battery when street\r\ncircuits cannot be drawn on.\r\n\r\nFor the details of making mineral sections, the works on petrography may\r\nbe consulted.\r\n\r\n=262. Separation of Silt Particles by Specific Gravity Solutions.=—In\r\nsilt separates the specific gravity of the different mineral particles\r\npresent may vary from graphite (1.9–2.3) to hematite (5.2–5–3).\r\n\r\nThe following list gives the specific gravities of some of the more\r\ncommon minerals which may be met with in soils:\r\n\r\n                      Gypsum            2.31\r\n                      Albite            2.56–2.63\r\n                      Quartz            2.65\r\n                      Talc              2.74\r\n                      Chlorite          2.78\r\n                      Muscovite         2.85\r\n                      Calcite           2.5–2.78\r\n                      Dolomite          2.90\r\n                      Tourmaline        2.94–3.3\r\n                      Biotite           3.01\r\n                      Apatite           3.16\r\n                      Pyroxenes         3.22–3.5\r\n                      Epidote           3.39\r\n                      Titanium Minerals 3.48–4.75\r\n                      Iron oxids        5.2–5.3\r\n\r\nThe finest particles of silt are separated by gravity with great\r\ndifficulty, inasmuch as they tend to remain suspended in the solutions\r\nfor an indefinite period. With the coarser silts, however, useful data\r\nare often obtained by this method. The separation is preceded by\r\nextraction of the particles with hydrochloric acid to remove encrusted\r\nsoluble matter, and by ignition to destroy any traces of organic matter.\r\nThose mineral matters which are soluble in acid or are changed by\r\nignition must, of course, be sought for in separate portions of the\r\nsilt,\r\n\r\n=263. Thoulet’s Solution.=[168]—The standard solution is of such a\r\ndensity that particles of 2.65 specific gravity-will just float thereon,\r\nusing for this purpose a solution of about 2.7 specific gravity. The\r\nsolution from which the above standard is prepared is made as follows:\r\n\r\nOne part of potassium iodid is weighed and placed in a beaker and one\r\nand one-quarter part of mercuric iodid is placed on top of it. Then\r\nwater is added in the proportion of ten cubic centimeters to 100 grams\r\nof the mixture, and after some time (twelve to twenty-four hours), with\r\noccasional stirring, the salts will nearly completely dissolve. Filter\r\nfrom the undissolved residue and evaporate in a porcelain dish until\r\ncrystals form on the surface of the liquid. Allow to cool, pour off the\r\nliquid from the crystals and evaporate the liquid for another crop. The\r\nfirst solution, after cooling, has a specific gravity between 3.10 and\r\n3.20, the second a specific gravity of 3.28, practically the limit of\r\ndensity of the solution. The solution of 2.7 specific gravity and other\r\ndensities are made by cautiously adding a few drops of water at a time\r\nand ascertaining the specific gravity by the Westphal balance or other\r\nconvenient method.\r\n\r\nThe strong solution, according to Goldschmidt,[169] may be prepared\r\ndirectly by using potassium iodid and mercuric iodid in the ratio of 1 :\r\n1.24. Twenty-five cubic centimeters of water, 210 grams of potassium\r\niodid, and 280 grams of mercuric iodid afford a solution of 3.196\r\nspecific gravity at 15°, on which fluorspar fragments will float.\r\n\r\n=264. Klein’s Separating Liquid.=—A solution of cadmium borotungstate,\r\nof the composition 2H₂O,2CdO,B₂O₃,9WO₃ + 16H₂O, has been proposed by\r\nKlein[170] for separating silt particles. This salt is obtained by\r\ndissolving pure sodium tungstate in five times its weight of water,\r\nadding one and a half parts of boric acid and boiling until, complete\r\nsolution takes place. On cooling; the borax is separated in crystalline\r\nform. The mother-liquor after the removal of the crystals is carefully\r\nconcentrated by boiling. By stirring the cold solution, there is a\r\nfurther separation of sodium borate and polyborate. This operation is\r\ncontinued until glass will float on the mother-liquor. The salt in\r\nsolution then has the following composition: 4Na₂O,12WO₃,B₂O₃. To this\r\nboiling concentrated solution, is added a boiling saturated solution of\r\nbarium chlorid, in the proportion of one part of the chlorid to three\r\nparts of the original double tungstate. An abundant pulverulent\r\nprecipitate is formed, making the whole mass mushy. The mass is filtered\r\nunder pressure and well-washed with hot water. The residue is then\r\nsuspended in hot water containing one part in ten of hydrochloric acid\r\nof 1.18 specific gravity. It is then evaporated to dryness in the\r\npresence of an excess of hydrochloric acid and decomposed, by which\r\nprocess hydrated tungstic acid is separated. The boiling mass is taken\r\nup with water and the boiling continued for two hours with occasional\r\naddition of water to take the place of that evaporated, and the tungstic\r\nacid separated by filtration.\r\n\r\nFrom the solution, beautiful quadratic crystals separate having the\r\ncomposition 9WO₃,B₂O₃,2BaO₂H₂ + 18H₂O. These are purified by several\r\nrecrystallizations and freed from any scales of boric acid by washing\r\nwith alcohol. Any reducing action, revealed by a violet coloration of\r\nthe crystals, can be avoided by adding a few drops of nitric acid. From\r\na boiling solution of these crystals, the cadmium salt desired is\r\nobtained by treatment with the proper amount of cadmium sulfate solution\r\nto precipitate the barium. The barium sulfate is separated by\r\nfiltration. The cadmium borotungstate is soluble in less than ten parts\r\nby weight of water. From this solution it is obtained in pure form by\r\nevaporation under a vacuum, or by carefully concentrating on a\r\nwater-bath and cooling. A saturated solution of these crystals at 15°\r\nhas a bright yellow color and a specific gravity of 3.28.\r\n\r\nIf a dilute solution of the above salt be carefully evaporated on a\r\nwater-bath, any violet color which may be present disappears when the\r\nspecific gravity reaches 2.7. If the evaporation be continued until a\r\ncrystal of augite will float on the hot liquid, crystals may be obtained\r\non cooling which, dissolved in as little water as possible, make a\r\nsolution which will almost support olivine. If the two solutions be\r\nunited, the specific gravity of the mixture is 3.30–3.36. The highest\r\nattainable specific gravity; _viz._, 3.6, is produced by continuing the\r\nevaporation on a water-bath until the liquid will support olivine, and\r\nthen allowing to stand in a closed place for twenty-four hours. The\r\ncrystals of cadmium borotungstate thus obtained are freed as much as\r\npossible from the mother-liquor by drainage and then melted at about 75°\r\nin their own water of crystallization. A liquid is thus obtained on\r\nwhich spinel will float. The same concentration may also be obtained by\r\ncareful heating on a water-bath. At its highest specific gravity this\r\nsolution has an oily consistence and this renders its practical use in\r\nthe separation of fine particles somewhat restricted. By filtering the\r\nliquor when a crystalline crust begins to form during evaporation, a\r\ncold solution of 3.360–3.365 specific gravity is obtained which is found\r\npractically useful. It has a higher specific gravity than Thoulet’s\r\nmixture, is not injurious to any of the mineral particles, not even of\r\niron with which it is brought into contact, but the trouble of preparing\r\nit is far greater than that of the mixture of mercuric and potassium\r\niodids.\r\n\r\n=265. Rohrbach’s Solution.=—The solution of barium mercuric iodid\r\nrecommended by Rohrbach[171] for this purpose was originally prepared by\r\nSuchsin. The solution must be rapidly prepared on account of the\r\ntendency of the barium salt to decomposition. The solution is prepared\r\nby weighing rapidly 100 grams of barium and 130 grams of mercuric iodid,\r\nmixing the two salts well in a dry flask and adding twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of water. The mixture is raised to a temperature of\r\n150°–200° on an oil-bath. The formation and solution of the double salt\r\nare promoted by constant stirring.\r\n\r\nAfter solution, the liquor is boiled for a few minutes and then\r\nevaporated on a water-bath until it will bear a crystal of epidote. On\r\ncooling, a small quantity of a yellow double salt is separated by\r\ncrystallization and the resulting mother-liquor is dense enough to carry\r\na fragment of topaz. Inasmuch as the liquor is filtered with difficulty,\r\nthe clear mother-liquor should be separated by decantation after\r\nstanding for several days. This solution has the disadvantage of not\r\nbeing dilutable with water, the addition of which causes a separation of\r\nred mercuric iodid. Were this solution not so easily decomposed, it\r\nwould prove of high value in silt separation.\r\n\r\n=266. Braun’s Separating Liquid.=—In many respects the separatory\r\nsolution proposed by Braun[172] is superior to those already mentioned.\r\nIt is the commercial methylene iodid, CH₂I₂, which has at 16° a specific\r\ngravity of 3.32, at 5° of 3.35, and at 25° of 3.31. It is a strongly\r\nrefractive liquid having a refractive index of 1.7466 for the yellow\r\nray.\r\n\r\nAs a separating medium the liquid is open to two objections; _viz._,\r\nfirst, it cannot be diluted with water and, second, it turns brown on\r\nheating or on long exposure to the sunlight.\r\n\r\nWhen dilution is necessary, it should be accomplished with benzene or\r\nxylene. To bring the diluted liquor again to its maximum density, the\r\nbenzene must be removed by evaporation, which causes a considerable loss\r\nin the liquid. When this substance becomes opaque, the transparency may\r\nbe restored by removing the separated iodin by shaking with potash lye,\r\nwashing with pure water, drying by the addition of pieces of calcium\r\nchlorid and filtering. The same result may also be reached by freezing\r\nand separating the liquid portion. The frozen portion on melting will\r\nhave the density of the original liquid.\r\n\r\n=267. Method of Bréon.=—Instead of a solution of a salt, Bréon[173] has\r\nproposed to use salts in a fused state for separating mineral particles.\r\nLead and zinc chlorids may be used for this purpose in a melted state,\r\nhaving the specific gravities of 5.0 and 2.4, respectively. By mixing\r\nthe molten salts in different proportions, any desired specific gravity\r\nbetween the extremes mentioned may be secured. The fusion is\r\naccomplished at 400° in a test-tube. The silt is added gradually with\r\nconstant stirring until a sharp separation is secured between the\r\nsinking and floating particles. After cooling, the tube is broken, the\r\ntwo parts separated, and the silt recovered by dissolving the mixed\r\nsalts in hot water containing a little nitric acid. Only the coarser\r\nsilts can be separated by this method. Fused silver nitrate, melting\r\npoint 198°, specific gravity 4.1, has also been used for separation.\r\n\r\n=268. The Separation.=—Forty cubic centimeters of the solution in the\r\nThoulet process are placed in the separatory tube A, Fig. 58, together\r\nwith from one to two grams of the silt and the stopper F inserted. The\r\ntube G is connected with a vacuum apparatus by means of which any air\r\nparticles adhering to the mineral fragments are removed. The silt which\r\nsinks in the solution is removed after G has been disconnected by\r\nopening the cock C and sucking through B at I. The cock C is closed and\r\nthe separated particles washed into a beaker at H after opening D. Water\r\nis next added to the materials left in A in quantities previously\r\ndetermined to secure a given specific gravity and thus a second, a\r\nthird, etc., separation secured. An intimate mixture of the solutions in\r\nA can be effected by closing D, opening C, and blowing through B in such\r\na way that no liquid is allowed to pass through C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.\r\n\r\n  THOULET’S SEPARATING\r\n  APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water to be added in each case to secure a given\r\nspecific gravity is determined by the formula _v_₁ = (_v_(D − _d_))/(_d_\r\n− 1), in which _v_ is the volume of the solution, D its specific\r\ngravity, and _d_ and _v_₁ the specific gravity desired and volume of the\r\nwater to be added.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Let the specific gravity of the original solution be 3.2, its\r\nvolume thirty cubic centimeters, and the desired specific gravity of the\r\nnew solution 2.85.\r\n\r\nThen _v_₁ = (30(3.2 − 2.85))/(2.85 − 1) = 5.68.\r\n\r\nThe desired specific gravity is therefore secured by adding 5.68 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, which is easily accomplished by means of the\r\ngraduations on the tube.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rosenbusch,[174] the calculated specific gravity as made\r\nabove is not wholly reliable on account of the contraction which takes\r\nplace. An empirical process is rather to be commended which consists in\r\nintroducing a fragment of mineral of known or desired specific gravity\r\nand then adding water drop by drop until the fragment remains suspended\r\nin the mixture. Should too much water be added, the necessary increase\r\nin density can be secured by adding a little of the strong solution.\r\n\r\n=269. Method of Packard.=—A separatory funnel, according to\r\nPackard,[175] may be safely used to hold the solution while separation\r\nis going on. As the lighter minerals form the bulk of soils, the heavier\r\nconstituting only a small percentage, it is well to use a wide funnel\r\nholding as much as one-half liter for quantitative separations, because\r\na large quantity of soil, say 100 grams, is necessary from which to\r\nrecover the small quantity of heavy particles satisfactorily. The soil\r\nis introduced into the solution contained in the funnel, agitated,\r\nstirred with a glass rod, and allowed to stand some time. This operation\r\nmay be repeated as often as desired. Separation is not absolute by this\r\noperation, the heavy and light particles being sometimes so united that\r\nthey sink or float together according as one or the other preponderates.\r\nThere are also particles having so nearly the same specific gravity as\r\nthe solution that they remain indifferent to its action in any position.\r\nAfter separation has been effected, the heavy portion is drawn off\r\nthrough the stop-cock of the funnel and the lighter is skimmed off the\r\ntop. Both must be thoroughly washed from the adhering heavy solution for\r\nfurther examination with the microscope, and by chemical, microchemical,\r\nand blow-pipe tests. One who has familiarized himself with the\r\nappearance of minerals in minute fragments under the microscope, in\r\nordinary and polarized light, will be able to determine some minerals in\r\nthat way. But for certain identification it is necessary to ascertain\r\ntheir optical properties as is done in the case of the minerals in thin\r\nsections of rocks.\r\n\r\n_Illustration._—The following example from the work of Packard will\r\nserve to illustrate the results of separating a soil by the specific\r\ngravity method:\r\n\r\nOne hundred grams of soil, residual clay from the Trenton limestone,\r\nwere placed in the Thoulet’s solution contained in the large separatory\r\nfunnel. The heavy portion, after washing and drying, weighed 0.6886\r\ngram, or 0.69 per cent. Of this, the magnet removed 0.1635 gram, or 0.16\r\nper cent. This heavy material consisted of rounded yellowish and brown\r\ngrains up to twenty-five millimeters in diameter, mingled with lustrous\r\nangular black grains which were seen under the microscope to be cubes\r\nwith striated faces, cubes penetrating each other and aggregations of\r\ncubes. Combinations of cubes with octahedra and instances of the\r\npentagonal dodecahedron were also observed. These forms, characteristic\r\nof pyrites, were also seen in the fine sand obtained as a residue on\r\nelutriating the same soil. As these crystals dissolved in hydrochloric\r\nacid, giving a strong iron solution, they were regarded as pseudomorphs\r\nof iron oxid after pyrites. The yellowish grains on treatment with acid\r\nleft a grayish residue which contained some grains of quartz but was not\r\nwholly quartz. The lighter portion of the soil, over ninety-nine per\r\ncent, which floated in the Thoulet’s solution of 2.8 was next examined.\r\nIt was colored red by the iron oxid which coated and adhered to the\r\nother minerals. It contained all the quartz, the feldspars if present,\r\nand the other minerals whose specific gravity is less than 2.8. It was\r\nexamined by the microscope and found to consist largely of irregular\r\ngrains of a mineral which acted on polarized light, obscured somewhat by\r\nthe iron oxid, and was apparently quartz; and another mineral which was\r\nyellowish-brown in color and seemed to be dull and not transparent.\r\nBesides there was a large quantity of indistinguishable amorphous\r\nmaterial. To clean these minerals the material was treated with\r\nhydrochloric acid to remove the iron oxid and other matter soluble in\r\nacid, when the quartz grains appeared transparent and gave interference\r\ncolors in polarized light. But mingled with these were grains of the\r\nother mineral which now appeared grayish, dull, and without action on\r\npolarized light. The character of this mineral substance could only be\r\ndetermined by chemical analysis.\r\n\r\n=270. Harada’s Apparatus.=—Although it has been affirmed by some\r\nanalysts that in the subsidence of small particles it is advisable that\r\nthe containing vessels have parallel sides, yet in the method just\r\ngiven, and in those about to be described, good results are obtained in\r\na funnel or pear-shaped holder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 59.\r\n\r\n  HARADA’S APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the apparatus of Harada,[176] Fig. 59, the separating vessel _a_ is\r\nmade of thick glass furnished with a glass stopper above and a glass\r\nstop-cock _h_ below. The separating liquid and silt are placed in the\r\npear-shaped vessel _a_, the stopper inserted, and the whole well-shaken.\r\nAs soon as a ring of clear liquid is seen between the sinking and\r\nfloating silt, the lower end of the apparatus is brought near the bottom\r\nof a conical glass _b_, the cock _h_ opened and the heavy silt allowed\r\nto fall out. Very little of the liquor will flow out because of the air\r\npressure. Should an air bubble enter the apparatus and be held at the\r\nstop-cock, it should be made to ascend by gently tapping. When all the\r\nheavy silt has passed into the conical glass, the cock _h_ is closed and\r\nsome water poured over the solution and silt in _b_. The separatory\r\napparatus is now raised until the beveled end of it is in the water\r\nlayer, when the water at once rises to _h_ and thus washes all the silt\r\nparticles adhering to the glass into _b_. The liquid in _a_ may then be\r\ndiluted by inverting the apparatus, adding the required amount of water\r\nthrough _h_, again shaken after closing _h_, and another separation\r\nsecured as before.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is somewhat easier to manipulate than Thoulet’s but does\r\nnot admit of the same quantitative dilution of the separating liquid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 60 a. FIG. 60 b. FIG. 60 c.\r\n\r\n  BRÖGGER’S APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=271. Apparatus of Brögger.=—All silt separations in narrow tubes are\r\nopen to the objection of permitting more or less flocculation. Some of\r\nthe lighter particles are thus carried down by the heavier, and, on the\r\nother hand, some of the heavier float with the lighter. This disturbing\r\naction Brögger[177] seeks to avoid by the following device, Fig. 60, a,\r\nb, c. The length of the apparatus is forty-six centimeters, and its\r\ngreatest diameter 3.5 centimeters. The opening in the large stop-cock A\r\nis the same diameter as that of the apparatus at that point. The cubical\r\ncontent of the apparatus with A open and B closed is about seventy-five\r\ncubic centimeters. In conducting the separation the cock B is closed,\r\nthe separating liquid and silt introduced, A being open, the stopper K\r\ninserted and the whole well-shaken. In the first separation, the silt S,\r\nlying over B is contaminated with some of the lighter particles S′₂,\r\nwhile the lighter particles above A, S₂, are mixed with some of the\r\nheavier particles, S′₁. After closing A the apparatus is again\r\nwell-shaken and inverted as in Fig. 60 b. The two parts of the silt will\r\nnow undergo another separation as indicated. The apparatus is now\r\ncarefully inclined as in c, when the various grades of silt will flow in\r\nthe directions indicated by the arrows, but without mixing, passing each\r\nother on opposite sides of the apparatus. When the movement is complete,\r\nA is carefully opened, the apparatus still being held as in c, and the\r\nlight silt formerly between A and B will flow above A, while the heavy\r\nsilt above A will flow down and join the silt collected over B. This\r\noperation may be repeated until a perfect separation is effected.\r\nFinally B is opened and the heavy silt collected in a beaker, and the\r\nlighter silt then removed from the upper part of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 61.\r\n\r\n  APPARATUS OF WÜLFING.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=272. Method of Wülfing.=—A somewhat more convenient method of purifying\r\nthe silt segregates and freeing them of mechanically occluded particles\r\nof differing specific gravities has been proposed by Wülfing.[178] An\r\nelliptical ring of heavy glass tubing carries glass stop-cocks A and B,\r\nFig. 61, at the two extremities of the ellipse, each arm of which is\r\nprovided with a lateral glass-stoppered neck. The perforation in the\r\nstop-cocks has the same diameter as the sides of the ellipse. The\r\napparatus has an interior cubical content of about forty cubic\r\ncentimeters. Thirty cubic centimeters of the separating fluid are\r\nintroduced through one of the lateral apertures and brought to the same\r\nheight in the two arms by opening the cock B. The silt is then\r\nintroduced in equal quantities into each of the arms. The stoppers\r\nhaving been inserted, the whole is well-shaken. At the beginning of the\r\nseparation, the apparatus being held in position 1, the lighter soil\r\nabove and the heavier soil below are somewhat mixed by reason of\r\nflocculation and mechanical entanglement. At this point B is opened and\r\nthe apparatus placed in the inclined position 2. The heavier particles S\r\n+ l, on the right arm, are thus united with the same class of particles\r\nin the left arm making 2S + 2l. This operation is hastened by opening A\r\nand allowing the higher column of liquid in the right arm to pass into\r\nthe left. The liquid in the left arm is allowed to rise to A. After all\r\nof S + l in the right arm has passed into the left B is closed, the\r\napparatus then placed back in position 1 and inclined in the opposite\r\ndirection until L + s in the top of the left arm has been transferred to\r\nthe L + s in the top of the right, and the same quantity of liquid is\r\nfound in each arm. The operation is then repeated and this continued\r\nuntil all S + s is found in the bottom of the left arm and all L + l in\r\nthe top of the right arm.\r\n\r\n=273. Separation with a Magnet.=—Particles of magnetic iron oxid are\r\neasily separated from the fine soil particles by means of a magnet. A\r\nstrong bar or horseshoe magnet may be used. Electro-magnets are rarely\r\nnecessary except for the separation of particles of feeble magnetic\r\npower. Particles of iron which may be found would owe their origin to\r\nthe mortars in which the soil had been pulverized, or they might come\r\nfrom a recently crushed meteorite. Some minerals, as limonite, after\r\nignition are attracted by the magnet and it is advisable to subject a\r\npart of the sample to this treatment. The best method of separation\r\nconsists in spreading the particles evenly on paper and gradually\r\nbringing the magnetic particles to one side by moving the magnet\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\n=274. Color and Transparency.=—But little can be learned from the color\r\nand transparency of the smallest silt particles, but these properties in\r\nthe larger grains have considerable diagnostic value. Many minerals of\r\ndistinct color appear wholly colorless in petrographic sections or in\r\nsilt particles, as for instance, highly-colored quartz. On the other\r\nhand, even the smallest particle of chlorite will show its distinctive\r\ntint. The colors in some minerals are due to occluded matter not\r\nessential to their structure, and these foreign bodies would naturally\r\nescape when the crystal mass is reduced to an almost impalpable powder.\r\n\r\n=275. Value of Silt Analyses.=—As in the case of chemical analyses a\r\nsilt analysis of a soil which is not typical or representative has\r\nlittle value. On the other hand, a systematic separation of soils into\r\nclasses of particles can not fail to reveal a definite correspondence of\r\nmechanical composition to soil properties. The production of a crop is\r\nthe result of certain functions, chief among which are temperature,\r\nmoisture, and plant food. In a given soil the temperature is markedly\r\naffected by its physical state. It has been demonstrated in previous\r\nparagraphs that the circulation of moisture in the soil and its capacity\r\nto be held therein are chiefly functions of the state of aggregation of\r\nthe soil itself. The availability of plant food in a soil is not\r\nmeasured by its quantity alone, but rather by its state of subdivision.\r\nIt is not therefore a matter of surprise that the fertility of a soil is\r\nfound, _caetèris paribus_, to be commensurate to a certain limit with\r\nthe percentage of fine silt and clay which it contains. It is true that\r\ntwo soils quite different in fertility, may have approximately the same\r\nsilt percentages, but in such a case it is demonstrable that even in the\r\npoorer soil the measure of fertility is largely the percentage of fine\r\nparticles and not its actual content of plant food. In other words,\r\nalmost all soils, even the poorest, have still large quantities of plant\r\nfood, but these stores, owing to certain physical conditions, are not\r\naccessible to the rootlets of plants. An illustration of this is seen in\r\nthe use of concentrated fertilizers. It might seem absurd to suppose\r\nthat the addition of 100 pounds of sodium nitrate would prove useful to\r\na plat containing already many tons of nitrogen; but the nitrate is at\r\nonce available and its beneficial influences are easily seen.\r\n\r\nThe full value of silt analysis will only be appreciated when many\r\ntypical soils from widely separated areas are carefully studied in\r\nrespect of their chemical and physical constitution and the character of\r\nthe crops which they produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   AUTHORITIES CITED IN PART FOURTH.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  Annual Report, Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, 1887.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  American Journal of Science, March 1879, p. 205.\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin, No. 4, United States Weather Bureau, p. 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  Chemical News, Vol. 30, August 7, 1874, p. 57.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  American Journal of Science, Vol. 29, 1885, p. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  American Journal of Science, Vol. 37, (1889), p. 122.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  Proceedings National Academy of Science, Baltimore Meeting, 1892.\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  Manuscript communication to author.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  Division of Chemistry, Bulletin 38, p. 200.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  Anleitung zur Wissenschaftlichen Bodenuntersuchung, S. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  Die Landwirtschaftlichen Versuchs-Stationen, Band 38, Ss. 309, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, Band 15, S. 3025.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, Annual Report, 1886, pp.\r\n  141, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  König, Untersuchung Landwirtschaftlich und Gewerblich Wichtiger\r\n  Stoffe, S. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Wahnschaffe, Anleitung zur Wissenschaftlichen Bodenuntersuchung, S.\r\n  25.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  Vid. 15, S. 24.\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  König, op. cit. 14, S. 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  Tenth Census of the United States, Vol. 3, pp. 872–3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  Wahnschaffe, op. cit. 15, S. 26.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  Le Stazioni Sperimentali Agrarie Italiane, Vol. 17, pp. 672, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  Vid. 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  Encyclopedie Chimique, Tome 4, pp. 155, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  Annales de la Science Agronomique, 1891, Tome 1, Seconde Fasicule, pp.\r\n  250, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Vid. 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Petermann, L’Analyse du Sol., p. 15.\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  Vid. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  Zeitschrift für analytische Chemie, Band 3, Ss. 89, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  Zeitschrift für analytische Chemie, Band 5, Ss. 295, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin de la Société des Naturalistes de Moscou, Tome 40, pp. 324,\r\n  et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  Journal für Landwirtschaft, Band 38, Theil 2, S. 162.\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, Annual Report, 1887, pp.\r\n  145, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:\r\n\r\n  Division of Chemistry, Bulletin No. 38, pp. 60, et seq.

Relation of Soil Composition to Gases.=—The power of a soil for\r\noccluding gases rests primarily on its composition as determined by silt\r\nanalysis. The discussion of this part of the subject is so nearly\r\nrelated to that of the physical properties of the soil that it might\r\nproperly have been included in that part of the work. Since, however, we\r\ndeal in this part more with the determination of the gas constituents of\r\nthe soil, it was deemed preferable to place it after the silt analysis\r\nand as introductory to the general estimation by more strictly\r\nanalytical processes of the chemical constituents of the soil.\r\n\r\n=277. Occurrence of Carbon Dioxid.=—The amount of organic matter in the\r\nsoil, according to Wollny,[179] is no indication of the quantity of\r\ncarbon dioxid when the organic matter is in excess. The percentage of\r\ncarbon dioxid is only proportional to the amount of organic matter when\r\nthis is in small quantities. Large quantities of organic matter do\r\nincrease the amount of carbon dioxid, but the increase is not a\r\nproportional one, since a larger quantity of this gas in the air of a\r\nsoil reduces the activity of the organisms which produce oxidation.\r\nWater and temperature have a greater influence on the oxidation, and act\r\nin an opposite direction to that of the organic matter. The amount of\r\nfree gas in the soil affords no indication either of the intensity of\r\nthe action of oxidation or of the amount of organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe addition of liquid manure to the soil results in a reduction of the\r\ndecomposition of the organic matter when the quantity of the salts\r\ntherein contained is greater than that already present in the soil. But\r\nif the liquid manure is dilute, and the absorptive power of the soil for\r\nsalts is great, then the decomposition is promoted.\r\n\r\n=278. Absorption of Aqueous Vapor.=—The power of a soil to resist\r\ndrought depends largely upon its coefficient of absorption for aqueous\r\nvapor. Hilgard has shown[180] that at temperatures between 7° and 21°,\r\nthe amount of aqueous vapor absorbed by a thin layer of a clay or soil\r\nnot unusually rich in humus, in a saturated atmosphere, is sensibly\r\nconstant. In general, clay soils are more absorbent than sandy ones, yet\r\nthere is no direct connection between the amount of clay present and the\r\nabsorbent power of the soil. Evidently the hygroscopic coefficient is\r\nlargely controlled by the presence with the clay of the powdery\r\ningredients which determine its looseness of texture, and it is found\r\nthat the finer silts themselves possess a considerable absorbing power.\r\nAccording to Whitney this is largely dependent upon the extent of the\r\nsurface area of the soil grains and upon the size and arrangement of\r\nthese grains. Again, the presence of hydrated ferric oxid materially\r\ninfluences this power, so that the amount of iron present must always be\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\n=279. Methods of Study.=—The study of the deportment of a soil with\r\nvapors or gases may be divided into two general classes. The first\r\ndepends on the subjection of a sample of soil to the saturating\r\ninfluence of a given vapor or gas and measuring the amount thereof\r\nabsorbed, either directly by increase of weight, or by the diminution in\r\nthe amount of gas originally supplied. The maximum absorbent capacity of\r\na soil under given conditions for a gas or vapor is in this way\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nIn the second class the determination consists in accurately estimating\r\nthe amount of gas which is absorbed by a soil in natural conditions or\r\n_in situ_, thus giving the natural percentages of the gaseous\r\nconstituents of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the first case in general, the principle of the method depends upon\r\nthe exposure of the soil for a given time under given conditions, to an\r\natmosphere of the gas to be absorbed. The principle of the second class\r\nof determinations depends upon the extraction, usually by means of\r\nsuction, from a given mass of soil of the gaseous matters therein\r\ncontained. The general details of the methods of procedure for the first\r\nclass are found in the following directions for manipulation:\r\n\r\n=280. Determination of the Maximum Hygroscopic Coefficient.=—The fine\r\nearth, in Hilgard’s method, is exposed to an atmosphere saturated with\r\nmoisture for about twelve hours at the ordinary temperature (60° F.) of\r\nthe cellar in which the box should be kept. The soil is sifted in a\r\nlayer of about one millimeter thickness upon glazed paper, on a wooden\r\ntable, and placed in a small water-tight covered box, twelve by nine by\r\neight inches, in which there is about an inch of water; the interior\r\nsides and cover of the box should be lined with blotting paper, kept\r\nsaturated with water, to insure the saturation of the air.\r\n\r\nAir-dried soil yields results varying from day to day to the extent of\r\nas much as thirty to fifty per cent, nor have we any corrective formula\r\nthat would reduce such observations to absolute measure. Knop’s law,\r\nthat the absorption varies directly as the temperature, while applicable\r\nto low percentages of saturation, is wide of the truth when saturation\r\nis approached. The ordinary temperature of cellars will serve well in\r\nthese determinations without material correction.\r\n\r\nAfter eight to twelve hours the earth is transferred as quickly as\r\npossible, in the cellar, to a weighed drying tube and weighed. The tube\r\nis then placed in a paraffin bath; the temperature gradually raised to\r\n200° C. and kept there twenty to thirty minutes, a current of dry air\r\npassing continually through the tube. It is then weighed again and the\r\nloss in weight gives the hygroscopic moisture in saturated air.\r\n\r\nThe reason for adopting 200° C. as the temperature for drying instead of\r\n100° is that water will continue to come off from most soils at the\r\nlatter temperature for an indefinite time, a week or more, before an\r\napproach to constancy of weight is attained; and that up to 200° only an\r\narbitrary limit can be assigned for the expulsion of hygroscopic\r\nmoisture. Moreover, the great majority of soils, especially those poor\r\nin humus, will reabsorb moisture from a saturated atmosphere to the full\r\nextent of that driven off at 200° C.\r\n\r\n=281. Estimation of the Absorption Power of Soils for Aqueous\r\nVapors.=[181]—_Method A._—The fine earth, ten to twenty grams, is spread\r\nout on a surface of about twenty-five square centimeters, and left for\r\nseveral days with the observation of the temperature of the air and the\r\nloss of weight determined from time to time. This evaporation is\r\ncontinued until the weight remains practically constant. Afterwards by\r\ndrying the sample at 100° the amount of hygroscopic moisture is\r\ndetermined. A similar result can be reached if the sample is first dried\r\nat 100°, or over sulfuric acid at ordinary temperatures, and then the\r\nincrease in weight observed which the sample acquires on being exposed\r\nfor several days to the atmosphere under ordinary conditions. Soils with\r\nabout the same content of humus show variations in the power to absorb\r\naqueous vapors which are almost proportional to the amount of clay which\r\nthey contain. With the increase of humus substance, the power of the\r\nsoil for absorbing moisture is increased, so that a sandy soil which is\r\nrich in humus often will retain as much moisture in an air-dried state\r\nas a clay soil which is poor in humus. If the experiment is carried on\r\nby drying over sulfuric acid instead of at 100°, the sample should be\r\nleft from four to seven days in order that a constant weight may be\r\nreached. Even after this time the loss in weight is 0.2 to 1.5 per cent\r\nless than when the sample is dried at 100°.\r\n\r\n_Method B._—In order to determine the amount of aqueous vapor which a\r\nsoil will absorb in an atmosphere saturated with the vapor the following\r\nmethod is used:\r\n\r\nThe sample of air-dried soil in a flat dish of given surface; _viz._,\r\nabout twenty grams of soil to twenty-five square centimeters surface is\r\nplaced in a vessel over water without contact with the water, and the\r\nwhole of the apparatus is covered with a glass bell-jar. The sample is\r\nweighed at intervals of six or eight hours until no appreciable increase\r\nof weight is observed. An empty vessel of the same size and character as\r\nthat containing the soil is kept under the bell-jar, also in the same\r\nconditions, so that any increase in weight by the deposition of moisture\r\non this vessel may be determined. This increase in weight is to be\r\ndeducted from the total increase in weight of the vessel and the soil.\r\nSandy and loamy soils become saturated in this manner in the course of\r\nthe first twenty-four hours and remain after that unchanged in weight.\r\nVery clayey soils, and also those which are very rich in humus, require\r\na much longer time, three or four days even. In this case it is better\r\nto take a smaller sample of the soil; _viz._, ten grams. The temperature\r\nof the air within the glass vessel, of course, must be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n_Method C._—The same flat dish and the same quantity of soil as in the\r\nother methods are taken in this one. The sample is left out over night\r\nwhere it can be fully saturated with dew. The amount of dew which\r\nappears on the bushes should be noted and also the temperature of the\r\nair and the percentage of clouds in the sky. An experiment should also\r\nbe made on spots of earth which are entirely free from vegetation in\r\norder that the difference in the amount of water absorbed in places\r\npractically devoid of dew and in places where the dew is abundant may be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n_Method D._—Deeper flat dishes should be used for this determination so\r\nthat the depth of soil contained in them shall be from one to three, or\r\neven six centimeters. The sample of soil should be completely air-dried\r\nand in a state of fine subdivision. The vessels containing the soil\r\nshould be placed in a locality saturated with aqueous vapor or in the\r\nopen air during the night where they are subjected to the influence of\r\nthe cooling of the atmosphere and the deposition of dew. Note should be\r\nmade of the different amounts of moisture absorbed by the layers of\r\nearth of different thicknesses in a given time. Observation should also\r\nbe made of the depth to which the moisture sinks in the sample of soil\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\n=282. Estimation of the Absorption Power of the Soil for Oxygen and\r\nAtmospheric Air.=[182]—From fifty to one hundred grams of air-dried soil\r\nare placed in a glass vessel of about 500 cubic centimeters capacity,\r\nand the flask closed with a stopper after the addition of enough water\r\nto make the percentage of moisture in the soil about twenty. After from\r\neight to fourteen days the air contained in the vessel is analyzed for\r\noxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxid, with special reference to the\r\ndetermination of how much oxygen has disappeared and how much the carbon\r\ndioxid has been increased. As an alternative method, twenty-five grams\r\nof the soil may be moistened with tolerably concentrated potash lye in a\r\nsmall glass vessel, which is itself joined with air-tight connections to\r\nan azotometer in which a known volume of air is confined by quicksilver.\r\nThe glass vessel is frequently shaken during the progress of the\r\nexperiment. The diminution of the volume of air in the apparatus after\r\nfrom one to four days gives approximately the quantity of oxygen\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\n=283. General Method of Determining Absorption.=—This method, due to\r\nFreiherrn von Dobeneck,[183] is as follows: The soil, in a state of fine\r\npowder, is dried at 100° to 105° to a constant weight. It is then placed\r\nin an absorption tube of the following construction:\r\n\r\nThe absorption tube consists of a =ᥩ= shaped wide glass tube, both ends\r\nof which are supplied with small glass tubes sealed upon the end of the\r\n=ᥩ= tube, and those are furnished with tightly-ground glass stop-cocks.\r\nAbove these stop-cocks these small tubes are bent in opposite directions\r\nat right angles. On the bend of the =ᥩ= is sealed another tube which is\r\nfurnished with a ground glass stopper. Through this opening the =ᥩ= tube\r\ncan be filled with the sample of soil. When the tube is filled, the\r\nglass stopper inserted, and the two stop-cocks on the small tubes\r\nclosed, the contents of the tube are completely excluded from the\r\nexternal atmosphere. Many of these tubes can be used at once so as to\r\nhasten the progress of the work.\r\n\r\nThe tubes after being filled are placed in a drying oven with the\r\nstop-cocks open. The stop-cocks are then closed before the tubes are\r\nremoved, when they are placed in a desiccator for cooling preparatory to\r\nweighing. The weighed tubes are held in a tin box which can be placed in\r\na water-bath which is kept at a given temperature by means of a\r\nthermostat. The top of the tin box should be hinged and made of a thick\r\nnon-conducting material so as to prevent any rapid change of temperature\r\nwithin. On the inner side of the box a small thin-walled glass tube is\r\ncarried around four times. One end of this tube passes through an\r\nopening in the side of the box by means of which it can be connected\r\nwith the gas apparatus outside. The other end of it is connected\r\ndirectly with the absorption tubes.\r\n\r\nThe absorption tubes are so connected among themselves that when ammonia\r\nor carbon dioxid is employed the gas passes through one of the tubes\r\nbefore it can reach the next, and so on. For experiments with water-gas,\r\nhowever, that is, air charged with aqueous vapor, the arrangement must\r\nbe different. While in the case of ammonia and carbon dioxid the\r\ncomposition of the gas is not changed by passing through the samples of\r\nsoil, the case is quite different when air charged with aqueous vapor\r\npasses through. In the latter case the amount of aqueous vapor in the\r\nair would be notably lessened in passing from sample to sample on\r\naccount of the retention of a part of the aqueous vapor by the soil. In\r\nthis case, therefore, the saturated air, after it has passed through the\r\nglass tube around the inside of the box in order to reach the proper\r\ntemperature, is conducted into a receptacle of glass which has a number\r\nof connections equal to the number of absorption tubes so that the\r\nsaturated air can pass directly into each one of them.\r\n\r\nThe gases which are to be used for the experiments are prepared in\r\nproper apparatus and are forced through the samples of soil, either by\r\npressure as in the case of ammonia or carbon dioxid, or by means of\r\naspirators as in the case of air saturated with aqueous vapor.\r\n\r\nThe carbon dioxid employed is purified by passing over sodium carbonate\r\nand calcium chlorid.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia is prepared by the action of finely powdered lime on\r\nammonium chlorid, and is dried by passing over lime and sticks of\r\npotassium hydroxid.\r\n\r\nThe air which is to be saturated with aqueous vapor, in order to purify\r\nit from dust, carbon dioxid, and ammonia, is passed through two flasks\r\nin which are contained respectively, diluted sulfuric acid and potash\r\nlye. It is afterwards thoroughly saturated with aqueous vapor at the\r\ntemperature desired.\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of soil material may be employed as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Pure quartz sand.—Freed from all fine particles by subjection to\r\nsilt analysis, afterwards boiled with hydrochloric acid and washed with\r\nwater to free it from all clayey materials. The sand prepared in this\r\nway should be passed through different sieves in order to prepare it in\r\ndifferent states of fineness.\r\n\r\n(2) Quartz powder.—Prepared from pure quartz crystals by grinding in an\r\niron mortar.\r\n\r\n(3) Kaolin.—Material such as is used in the manufacture of the finest\r\nporcelain which, after being freed of all foreign matter, is rubbed to a\r\nfine powder in a porcelain mortar.\r\n\r\n(4) Humus.—Washed with ether and alcohol, boiled with hydrochloric acid,\r\nwashed, dried and reduced to a state of fine powder.\r\n\r\n(5) Iron oxid.\r\n\r\n(6) Calcium carbonate.—Precipitated, washed, and dried.\r\n\r\n(7) Soil mixtures.—Prepared artificially by mixing the kaolin, quartz,\r\nand humus, above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of gas absorbed by each of these materials is determined by\r\nfilling the tubes, as above mentioned, with the dried material. The\r\ncontent of each tube is previously determined by filling with mercury\r\nand weighing. Having determined the weight of the substance to the\r\nexclusion of the air contained within its pores, it is treated with the\r\ngas in the apparatus described above and weighed from time to time until\r\nno further increase of weight takes place.\r\n\r\nThe method of calculating the results is shown in the following scheme:\r\n\r\nV = content of the absorption tube obtained by filling with mercury and\r\nweighing.\r\n\r\nP′ = weight of the empty tube filled with air at 100°.\r\n\r\npl = weight of the air in the tube (pl = V × specific gravity of the air\r\nat 100°).\r\n\r\npt′ = weight of the tube (pt′ = P′ − pl).\r\n\r\nP² (second weighing) = weight of the tube filled with the substance with\r\nthe included air at 100°.\r\n\r\nv^s = volume of the substance calculated according to the formula\r\n\r\n            v^s = (P² − P′)/(s^s − specific gravity of air).\r\n\r\ns^s = specific gravity of the substance.\r\n\r\nvl = volume of the air in the flask filled with the substance (vl = V −\r\nv^s).\r\n\r\npl′ (weight of this included air) = vl × specific gravity.\r\n\r\np^s = weight of the substance (pl = p² − pt′ − pl)\r\n\r\nP³ = weight of the apparatus at the end of the experiment.\r\n\r\nsg = specific gravity of the gas employed for saturation.\r\n\r\npg (weight of the gas remaining over the substance) = vl × sg.\r\n\r\npa (weight of the absorbed gas) = P³ − pt′ − p^s − pg.\r\n\r\np^s gram of substance absorbs pa gram of the gas and 100 grams of\r\nsubstance would absorb (100 × pa)/(p^s) grams.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravities of the gases employed are calculated from the\r\ntables given by Landolt and Börnstein in “Physical and Chemical Tables,”\r\npage 5.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of the quartz sand employed was 2.639; of the\r\nquartz powder, 2.622; of the kaolin, 2.503; of the humus, 1.462; of the\r\niron hydroxid, 3.728; and of the calcium carbonate, 2.678.\r\n\r\nOne liter of ammonia, at a pressure of 760 millimeters of mercury and a\r\ntemperature of 0°, weighs 0.7616 gram; one liter of carbon dioxid,\r\n1.9781 grams; one liter of aqueous vapor, 0.8064 gram; and one liter of\r\ndried air, 1.2931 grams.\r\n\r\nAt a pressure of 720 millimeters, and at 20° temperature, a liter of air\r\nsaturated with aqueous vapor at 0° weighs 1.1383 grams; saturated at\r\n8.6°, 1.1362 grams; saturated at 10°, 1.1358 grams; saturated at 14°,\r\n1.1340 grams; saturated at 18.2°, 1.1330 grams; saturated at 20°, 1.1321\r\ngrams; saturated at 30°, 1.1313 grams.\r\n\r\nThe general results of the experiments are as follows:\r\n\r\n                            ABSORPTION AT 0°.\r\n\r\n                           Aqueous vapor     Ammonia.

We pass next to consider the\r\nquantities of gases or vapor soils _in situ_ may hold.\r\n\r\n=284. Method of Boussingault and Lewey.=[184]—This method is the oldest\r\nand most simple procedure for estimating the nature of the gases held in\r\na soil _in situ_.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of collecting the sample of gas from the soil a hole,\r\nthirty to forty centimeters in depth, is dug, and a tube placed in it in\r\na vertical position, having on its lower extremity a bulb perforated\r\nwith fine holes. The hole is filled and the earth closely packed around\r\nthe tube which is left for twenty-four hours. At the end of that time\r\nthe tube is slowly aspirated until a volume of gas approaching from five\r\nto ten liters is obtained.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Carbon Dioxid._—The carbon dioxid in the sample of gas is\r\nestimated by allowing it to bubble through a solution of barium\r\nhydroxid.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Oxygen._—The oxygen is estimated in a separate sample\r\nof the gas by means of potassium pyrogallate.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to this simple process is the uncertainty of being\r\nable to obtain an average sample of the occluded gas. In digging the\r\nhole and refilling, there must evidently be a considerable disturbance\r\nof the original distribution of the gas or vapor.\r\n\r\nThe methods of Pettenkofer[185] and Aubry[186] are essentially like that\r\njust described. Pettenkofer found the largest quantities of carbon\r\ndioxid in the earth gases in July, August, and September, and the\r\nsmallest quantities in the winter months.\r\n\r\nNo greater detail concerning these methods of the direct aspiration of\r\nthe air is considered necessary inasmuch as the methods about to be\r\ndescribed, while more elaborate, are superior in accuracy to the older\r\nmethods mentioned. In general, in these experiments, it is deemed\r\nsufficient to determine the carbon dioxid only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 62.\r\n\r\n  SCHLOESING’S SOIL-TUBE FOR COLLECTING GASES.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=285. Method of Schloesing.=—The apparatus used by Schloesing[187] in\r\nthe collection of the soil gases consists of a steel tube (Fig. 62) a\r\nlittle over one meter in length, ten millimeters in external diameter,\r\nand one and one-half to two millimeters in internal diameter. The end\r\nwhich penetrates the soil is made slightly conical for a distance of\r\ntwenty-five to thirty centimeters. By reason of the shape of the tube,\r\nwhen it is driven into the soil all connection between the orifice in\r\nthe point of the tube and the external air is prevented. The obstruction\r\nof the internal canal of the tube is prevented by introducing a thread\r\nof steel which penetrates the whole length of the tube. This thread,\r\nrepresented by A, B, C, D, is flush with the interior extremity of the\r\ntube at D. It extends for about three centimeters above the upper end of\r\nthe tube in order to be easily handled when it is to be removed.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of driving the tube into the soil its upper part is\r\ncovered with a cylindrical piece of steel, EF, in the interior of which\r\nare freely engaged H and A. This head piece rests upon a ring of steel,\r\nK. This ring is fastened solidly into the tube. On striking the piece EF\r\nthe tube and the steel wire in the center are driven together into the\r\nsoil. The tube is flattened at L and L′ in order to be embraced by the\r\nkey MM, the employment of which is necessary in order to revolve the\r\ntube around its axis when it is being driven into the soil. When the\r\ntube has been driven to the depth desired, the steel wire is withdrawn\r\nand it is immediately connected at H with the rubber tube N (Fig. 63)\r\nbelonging to the system PQT, and furnished with a pinch-cock X. The\r\nsystem PQT comprises the following elements: PQT made of a capillary\r\nglass tube in the form of a T. The lower end of the tube P is closed by\r\nthe larger glass tube O, sealing the end of P with a little mercury. O\r\nis held to P by the cork S, which is attached firmly enough to prevent O\r\nfrom dropping off, but is furnished with a canal in order to allow the\r\nair to flow in or out freely. This system is connected with the system\r\nUV by the rubber connection T. U is a glass vessel having the\r\nconstrictions as indicated in its stem above and below the bulb. V is a\r\nglass vessel of convenient size connected with U by the rubber tubing as\r\nindicated. The capacity of the cylindrical portion of U should be from\r\nfifteen to eighteen cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 63.\r\n\r\n  SCHLOESING’S APPARATUS FOR COLLECTING GASES FROM SOIL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo take a sample of soil gas, V is lifted above U. The air is driven\r\nfrom U and escapes through O, which acts as a true valve. When the\r\nmercury has completely filled U the pinch-cock X is opened and V\r\ndepressed gradually. The gas coming from the soil is thus collected in\r\nU. A few cubic centimeters of the soil gas are collected in this way,\r\nthe pinch-cock X is again closed and V is raised in order to drive the\r\nwhole of the contents of U again through O. In this way the whole of the\r\nair which the capillary vessel originally contained is removed and all\r\nparts of it remain filled with soil gas. Two or three operations, using\r\nfrom five to ten centimeters of soil gas in all, will be sufficient to\r\ncompletely free the apparatus from its original content of air. U is\r\nthen entirely filled by depressing V, and it is then hermetically sealed\r\nat the two constricted points by means of an alcohol lamp. The sealed\r\ntube can then be transported to the laboratory and its contents\r\nsubjected to eudiometric analysis.\r\n\r\nWithout displacing the tube from the soil, several samples of gas can be\r\ntaken from the same spot. A sufficient number of the bulbs V should be\r\nat hand to hold the required number of samples. Instead of submitting\r\nthe sample to eudiometric analysis it is usually sufficient to determine\r\nthe quantity of carbon dioxid which it contains, inasmuch as numerous\r\nexperiments have shown that in 100 parts of soil gas the oxygen and\r\ncarbon dioxid together constitute twenty-one parts. No appreciable trace\r\nof marsh gas, or other combustible gas, has yet been detected in\r\nordinary arable soils. These gases have only been found in special soils\r\nfrom marshes, in the neighborhood of gas wells, etc., and not in arable\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 64.\r\n\r\n  SCHLOESING’S APPARATUS FOR DETERMINATION OF CARBON DIOXID.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=286. Apparatus for Estimating the Carbon Dioxid.=—The apparatus used\r\nfor determining the carbon dioxid in Schloesing’s work consists of the\r\napparatus shown in Fig. 64. A represents a glass vessel surrounded by a\r\njacket of glass, full of water, and sealed on its lower part to the tube\r\nBC of about six millimeters internal diameter. On its upper part it is\r\nsealed to the capillary tube D. The tube BC is graduated from C in\r\nhundredths of the volume of DAC, which volume is about twelve cubic\r\ncentimeters. On its lower part it is connected by a rubber tube with a\r\nreservoir F which is capable of being raised or lowered. GHK are\r\ncapillary tubes connected together by the rubber tubes L and M, which\r\nare furnished with pinch-cocks. The tube G is connected to a vacuum by\r\nthe rubber tube N. The rubber tube should be of very small internal\r\ndiameter and from forty to fifty centimeters in length. To the tube H\r\nare sealed, at right angles, the branch D and another branch O. This\r\nlast dips into a little mercury which the tube P contains. It serves as\r\na valve, permitting the exit of the gases but not their entrance. The\r\ntube K carries some lines engraved on its inferior part and is sealed to\r\nthe system of the two bulbs Q and R. The bulb Q contains a concentrated\r\nsolution of potash. It carries a number of pieces of glass tubing for\r\nthe purpose of increasing the surface of the potash solution.\r\n\r\nAll the parts of the apparatus are fixed upon a rectangular board,\r\nnineteen centimeters broad by twenty centimeters long. This forms one of\r\nthe faces of a wooden box to which it is hinged and which serves for the\r\ntransportation of the apparatus in a vertical position. The graduation\r\nof the tube BC is recorded behind this tube upon a card fixed upon the\r\nboard. By means of these two graduations, the height of the mercury in\r\nthe tube BC is most easily read, even when the tube is not perfectly\r\nvertical. Each one of the pinch-cocks L and M, on its upper part is\r\nfixed in a sort of guard which prevents it from being displaced\r\nlaterally during the processes of the manipulation, thus avoiding all\r\ndanger of breakage.\r\n\r\nAfter the operation is finished a little air is sent into Q in such a\r\nmanner as to sensibly lower the level of the solution of potash, and the\r\nupper extremity of R is closed with a rubber stopper. Afterward, the\r\napparatus can be transported without any danger of the potash becoming\r\nengaged in the tube K and reaching the measuring tank A.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to the analysis, a stake is driven into the soil to which all\r\nof the apparatus can be fixed. At the side of the stake the apparatus\r\nfor taking the sample, already described, is driven into the soil and\r\nthis apparatus is connected by the tube N with the apparatus for\r\ndetermining the carbon dioxid. The pinch-cocks L and M being closed, F\r\nis lifted until the mercury which runs from it fills A and approaches D.\r\nDuring this time the air which the apparatus contains has been driven\r\nout through O. The tube NGD is freed from air by opening the pinch-cock\r\nL, lowering F and drawing into A the gas coming from the soil; afterward\r\nclosing L and driving out the gas through O. After two or three rinsings\r\nof this kind, which employ altogether only ten to twelve cubic\r\ncentimeters, the gas which is to be analyzed is sucked into A. For this\r\npurpose F is lowered until the mercury in the tube BC is very near C.\r\nThe pinch-cock L is closed and M opened. The reservoir F is displaced\r\nlittle by little by pressing lightly against the rectangular board in\r\norder to give it greater firmness in such a way as to fix the level of\r\nthe mercury exactly at C, and the line is noticed where the solution of\r\npotash in K stands. The gas contained in the apparatus is under a\r\npressure, the difference of which from the external pressure is\r\nrepresented by the column of the potash solution between the mark just\r\nnoticed and the level of the same solution in the bulb R. In order to\r\nabsorb the carbon dioxid, F is lifted until the mercury stands between D\r\nand E. The gas thus passes from A into Q. It gives up immediately its\r\ncarbon dioxid to the potash solution. It is then made to come again into\r\nA, and afterward a second time into Q in order to free it from the last\r\ntrace of dioxid. Finally it is made to return to A and F is kept at such\r\na height that the potash solution maintains in the tube K the same level\r\nas at the commencement of the operation. The gas is then at the same\r\npressure to which it was subjected before absorption. The level of the\r\nmercury is then read on BC. At the time the apparatus is used, the\r\nmeasuring tube A should be slightly moist. If it is not so, a small\r\nquantity of water should be introduced which is afterward rejected, but\r\nwhich leaves a sufficient quantity of moisture upon the internal walls\r\nof A. In this way the gas will always, before or after absorption of\r\ncarbon dioxid, be saturated with vapor of water, and the figure read in\r\nthe last place upon the tube BC represents the percentage of carbon\r\ndioxid in 100 parts of the gas extracted from the soil supposed to be\r\nsaturated with vapor at the temperature of the experiment.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the analysis, the temperature of the measuring\r\nflask, which is almost entirely surrounded with water, does not vary\r\nsensibly, but in a series of experiments which are executed at different\r\ntimes, the temperature of the measuring apparatus, which is that of the\r\nambient air, may change much. It may oscillate between 10° to 25°, and\r\nexceptionally between 0° and 30°, whence there are notable variations in\r\nthe tension of the vapor of the gas measured. If it should be desired to\r\ncalculate to 100 parts of dry gas the observations made at 30° upon 100\r\nparts of saturated gas, it would be necessary to increase the percentage\r\nof carbon dioxid by about ¹⁄₂₅ of its value. It is noticed that with the\r\napparatus described above, the gas upon which the estimation is really\r\nconducted comprises not only that which the measuring apparatus contains\r\nfrom E to C before the absorption of the carbon dioxid, but also the\r\nsmall quantity which remains in the capillary tube KME at the moment\r\nwhen closing the pinch-cock M, after the second rinsing, the gas from\r\nthe soil is aspired into EAC. On the other hand, there is left in the\r\nsame tube KME, when the final reading is made, some gas which belongs to\r\nthat which has been measured at the end. These two small gaseous\r\nportions which we consider in the tube KME to be sensibly equal, do not\r\ncontain any carbon dioxid and may be left out of consideration. That is\r\nwhy the volume of the measuring apparatus is limited to E and the\r\ngraduation of the tube BC is in hundredths of the volume comprised from\r\nE to C. In reality the two portions are not absolutely equal because the\r\ntwo successive levels of the potash solution, which limit them in the\r\ntube K, are not absolutely identical. These two levels can differ in\r\nsuch a manner as to correspond to a volume of about ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ of the\r\nmeasuring apparatus. Thus the estimation is really made upon a volume of\r\ngas which may be greater or less by ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ than the volume of EAC;\r\nwhence there might result an error of ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ in the estimation of the\r\ncarbon dioxid, an error which is wholly negligible.\r\n\r\nAs a result of numerous analyses it is concluded, first, that the oxygen\r\nexists normally in the atmosphere of soils in large proportion; second,\r\nvery probably the gaseous atmosphere of arable soils, to a depth of\r\nsixty centimeters, contains scarcely one per cent of carbon dioxid and\r\nabout twenty per cent of oxygen; third, the highest percentages of\r\ncarbon dioxid correspond to epochs of highest temperature and periods of\r\ngreatest calm; fourth, the proportion of carbon dioxid increases\r\nordinarily with the depth at which the samples are taken. This\r\ndisposition of the carbon dioxid would appear almost necessary, since\r\nnear the surface the internal atmosphere is almost constantly diluted by\r\nexternal air by virtue of diffusion. Fifth, from one epoch to another\r\nthe composition of the atmosphere of the soil can undergo considerable\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n=287. Determination of Diffusion of Carbon Dioxid in Soil.=—The method\r\nproposed by Hannén[188] is a convenient one to use in studying the rate\r\nof diffusion of carbon dioxid in soils. A large Woulff’s bottle with\r\nthree necks serves for the reception of the gas. The two smaller outer\r\nnecks of the bottle carry two glass tubes bent outwards and provided\r\nwith stop-cocks. One of these passes to near the bottom of the bottle\r\nand the other just through the stopper. The middle tubule of the bottle\r\nis of a size to give in section an area of about twenty-two square\r\ncentimeters. It is made with a heavy rim two centimeters wide and plane\r\nground. This rim carries a plane-ground glass plate with a circular\r\nperforation in one-half of it, of the size of the opening in the central\r\ntubule of the bottle. A glass cylinder, carrying a fine wire-gauze\r\ndiaphragm near the lower end, fits with a ground-glass edge air-tight,\r\nover this aperture, being held in position by a brass clamp. The\r\nground-glass plate moves air-tight between the cylinder and the bottle,\r\nso that the cylinder can be brought into connection with the bottle or\r\ncut off therefrom without in any way opening the bottle to the air. The\r\nplate and all ground movable surfaces should be well lubricated with\r\nvaseline.\r\n\r\nThe experiment is carried on as follows: The glass cylinder is filled\r\nwith the soil to be tested, closed above with a rubber stopper carrying\r\na gas tube, and then by moving the perforated-glass plate brought into\r\nconnection with the bottle. The side tube, with short arm inside the\r\nbottle, is then closed, and carbon dioxid introduced through the other\r\nlateral tube until the gas passing from the tube at the top of the\r\ncylinder is pure carbon dioxid.\r\n\r\nThe lateral tube is then closed and the bottle is placed in a water-bath\r\nand kept at a constant temperature of 20°. When the temperature within\r\nand without the apparatus is the same the reading of the barometer is\r\nmade, the stopper removed from the top of the cylinder, and the process\r\nof diffusion allowed to begin. After from six to ten hours the glass\r\nplate is moved so as to break the connection between the cylinder and\r\nbottle. The carbon dioxid remaining in the bottle is driven out by a\r\nstream of dry, pure air. The air is allowed to pass through the\r\napparatus for about ten hours. The carbon dioxid driven out is collected\r\nin an absorption apparatus and weighed. The absorption apparatus should\r\nconsist of a series of Geissler potash absorption bulbs and finally a\r\n=ᥩ= form soda-lime tube. In front of the absorption apparatus is placed\r\na drying bulb containing sulfuric acid. Inasmuch as the temperature and\r\npressure can be readily determined, the weight of carbon dioxid obtained\r\nis easily calculated to volume.\r\n\r\nThe weight of 1,000 cubic centimeters of carbon dioxid at 0° and 760\r\nmillimeters pressure is 1.96503 grams. Therefore one milligram is\r\nequivalent to 0.5089 cubic centimeter of the gas. The volume of the\r\nbottle should be carefully determined by calibration with water. The\r\nresults should be calculated to cubic centimeters per square centimeter\r\nof exposed surface in ten hours. The depth of the soil layer is\r\nconveniently taken at twenty centimeters.\r\n\r\n=288.

The weight of soil\r\nin the diffusion tube was 520 grams. The volume of gas, at 0° and 760\r\nmillimeters, before the diffusion began was 2549.4 cubic centimeters.\r\nThe volume of carbon dioxid under standard conditions remaining after\r\nten hours of diffusion was 1230.3 cubic centimeters. This volume is\r\ncalculated from the weight of carbon dioxid obtained in the potash\r\nbulbs, each milligram being equal to 0.5089 cubic centimeter of carbon\r\ndioxid. The volume of carbon dioxid diffused is therefore 2549.4 −\r\n1230.3 = 1319.1 cubic centimeters. The per cent of carbon dioxid\r\ndiffused is 1319.1 ÷ 2549.4 = 51.74. The volume of carbon dioxid\r\ndiffused for each square centimeter of cross section of the diffusion\r\ntube is 1319.1 ÷ 22 = 59.9 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe carbon dioxid should be passed long enough to secure complete\r\nexpulsion of the air before the determination is commenced.\r\n\r\n=289. General Conclusions.=—The general results of the experiments with\r\nthe diffusion apparatus to determine the effect of the physical\r\ncondition of the soil upon the rate of diffusion are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The diffusion of carbon dioxid through the soil is, at a constant\r\ntemperature, chiefly dependent upon the pores in the cross section of\r\nthe column of soil. Therefore, the absolute quantity of the diffused gas\r\nis greater the larger the total volume of the pores and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n2. Every diminution of the volume of the pores, whether secured by\r\npressure of the soil or by an increase in the moisture thereof, is\r\nfollowed by a decrease in the volume of diffused gas. The giving up of\r\nthe carbon dioxid present in the soil atmosphere to the upper atmosphere\r\nby the method of diffusion is therefore the less the finer the soil is,\r\nthe more compressed the soil particles are, and the larger the water\r\ncapacity of the sample and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n3. The quantity of diffused carbon dioxid is diminished according to the\r\nmeasure of compression to which the soil is subjected but is not\r\nstrictly proportional to the height of the soil layer.\r\n\r\n4. In soils in which rain water percolates slowly the diffusion of the\r\ncarbon dioxid on account of this property is depressed to a greater or\r\nless extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AUTHORITIES CITED IN PART FIFTH.\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of\r\n  Science, 1872, p. 328.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  Die Landwirtschaftlichen Versuchs-Stationen, 1889, S. 197.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  König, Untersuchung Landwirtschaftlich und Gewerblich Wichtiger\r\n  Stoffe, Ss. 64–66.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  König, op cit. supra.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  Forschungen auf dem Gebiete der Agricultur-Physik, Band 15, S. 190.\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  Annales de Chimie et de Physique, Tome 37, 1853; Encyclopedie\r\n  Chimique, Tome 4, p. 154.\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:\r\n\r\n  Zeitschrift für Biologie, Band 7, S. 395 and Band 9, S. 250.\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  Jahresbericht für Agriculturchemie, Band 1, S. 160.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 1891, Sixième Série, Tome 23, pp.\r\n  362, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  Op. cit. 5, 1892, Ss. 8, et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PART SIXTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n=290. Preliminary Considerations.=—The sample of soil intended for\r\nchemical analysis should consist of the fine earth which has passed at\r\nleast a one-millimeter mesh sieve and subsequently been completely\r\nair-dried. According to Petermann the air-drying of a soil should\r\ncontinue for about four days for an ordinary arable soil, and about six\r\ndays for one very rich in organic matter. With peat and muck soils I\r\nhave found that ten or twelve days with frequent stirring, even when in\r\nthin layers, are necessary to attain approximately a constant weight.\r\n\r\nThe soil is conveniently spread on a zinc or other metal sheet of\r\nsufficient area so that the layer will be only one or two centimeters in\r\nthickness. The weight before and after desiccation will give the\r\npercentage of moisture lost on air-drying, which, of course, will depend\r\nchiefly on the degree of saturation of the sample when taken and the\r\natmospheric conditions prevailing during drying.\r\n\r\nIf samples of soil are taken in very dry times it is often necessary to\r\nmoisten them with distilled water in order to prepare them properly for\r\nair-drying.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of hygroscopic water which the sample loses at 100°–105°\r\nshould be determined, and all subsequent calculations of the percentages\r\nof the various constituents be based on the water-free material. When a\r\nsoil which has been dried at 100°–105° to a constant weight is heated to\r\n140°–150° it loses additional weight not due to loss of water of\r\nconstitution. A part of this loss may be due to hygroscopic moisture\r\nwhich is not given off at 100°–105°, and a part may be hydrocarbons, or\r\nother easily volatile organic or inorganic bodies. Before estimating the\r\ntotal loss on ignition it is recommended by most chemists to dry at\r\n140°–150°. The samples of soil, however, intended for chemical\r\nexamination should never be dried beyond the point which is reached by\r\nexposure in thin layers at ordinary room temperatures. The state of\r\naggregation, degree of solubility, and general properties of a soil, may\r\nbe so changed by absolute desiccation as to render the subsequent\r\nresults of chemical investigation misleading. In the methods which\r\nfollow the actual processes employed have been given, which in some\r\ninstances transgress the general principle stated above, but in all\r\ncases standard and approved methods are given in detail, even if some of\r\ntheir provisions seem unnecessary or imperfect.\r\n\r\n=291. Order of Examination.=—First of all in a chemical study of the\r\nsoil should be determined, its reaction (with litmus), its water-holding\r\npower in the air-dried state (hygroscopicity), its content of combined\r\nwater (giving hydrous silicates of alumina), its organic matter (humus\r\nand organic nitrogen), its content of carbon dioxid (carbonates of the\r\nalkaline earths), and the part of it soluble in acids. A determination\r\nof these values gives the analyst a general view of the type of soil\r\nwith which he is engaged, and leads him to adopt such a method of more\r\nextended analysis as the circumstances of the case may demand.\r\n\r\nFor this reason those operations which relate to the above\r\ndeterminations are placed first in the processes to be performed, while\r\nthe estimation of the more particular ingredients of the soil is left\r\nfor subsequent elaboration.\r\n\r\nNext follows a description of the standard methods of estimating the\r\nmore important elements passing into solution on treatment of a soil\r\nsample with an acid. The method of treating the insoluble residue, and\r\nthe detection and estimation of rare or unimportant soil constituents,\r\ncloses the analytical study of the soils.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the determination of nitrogen as nitric or nitrous acid\r\nin the soil and drainage waters, it has been thought proper to collect\r\nall standard methods relating particularly thereto into one group, and\r\nthey will appear separate from the methods under nitrogen analysis in\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\nThe question of the utility of chemical soil analyses is one which has\r\nbeen the subject of vigorous discussion, a discussion which finds no\r\nproper place in a work of this character. Unless, however, intelligent\r\nsoil analysis be productive of some good it would be a thankless task to\r\ncollect and arrange the details of the processes employed. An accurate\r\ndetermination of the constituents of a soil may not enable the chemist\r\nto recommend a proper course of treatment, but it will help in many ways\r\nto develop a rational soil diagnosis which will permit the physician in\r\ncharge of the case, who last of all is the farmer, to follow a rational\r\ntreatment which in the end will be productive of good.\r\n\r\nThe analyst will find in the methods given all that are approved by\r\nbodies of official or affiliated chemists, or by individual experience,\r\nand among them some method may be found which, it is hoped, will be\r\nsuited, in the light of our present knowledge, to each case which may\r\narise.\r\n\r\n=292. Reaction of the Soil.=—In soils rich in decaying vegetable matter\r\nthe excess of acid is often great enough to produce a distinct acid\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, in arid regions the accumulation of salts near the\r\nsurface may produce the opposite effect.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the soil may be determined with a large number of\r\nindicators among which, for convenience, sensitive litmus paper, both\r\nred and blue, stand in the front rank. A sample of the soil, from\r\nfifteen to thirty grams, is mixed with water to a paste and allowed to\r\nsettle. The litmus paper is then dipped into the supernatant liquid.\r\n\r\n=293. Determination of Water in Soil.=—The following problems are\r\npresented:\r\n\r\n(a) _The Determination of Water in Fresh Samples taken in situ._—The\r\ncontent of water in this case varies with the date and amount of\r\nrain-fall, the capacity of the soil for holding water, the temperature\r\nand degree of saturation of the atmosphere, and many other conditions,\r\nall of which should be noted at the time the samples are taken.\r\n\r\n(b) _The Determination of Water in Air-Dried Samples._—In this case the\r\nsoil is allowed to remain in thin layers, and exposed to the air until\r\nit ceases to lose weight. The quantity of water left is dependent on the\r\ncapacity of the soil to hold hygroscopic water and to the temperature\r\nand degree of saturation of the air.\r\n\r\n(c) _The Determination of the Total Water by Ignition._—This process not\r\nonly gives the free and hygroscopic moisture, but also combined water\r\npresent in the hydrous silicates and otherwise. The estimation is\r\ncomplicated by the presence of carbonates and organic matter.\r\n\r\n=294. Determination of Water in Fresh Samples.=—This determination\r\nrequires that the sample, when taken in the field, should be so secured\r\nas to be weighed before any loss of moisture can take place. For this\r\npurpose it can be sealed up in tubes or bottles and preserved for\r\nexamination in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nAccording to Whitney, the relations of soils to moisture and heat are\r\nsuch prominent factors in the distribution and development of\r\nagricultural crops, that the determination of the actual moisture\r\ncontent of soils in the fields should be considered a necessary part of\r\nthe meteorological observations, and of far more importance, indeed, or\r\nhaving far more meaning to the agriculturist than the simple record of\r\nthe rain-fall.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the relation of the soil to moisture, uninfluenced\r\nby the varying conditions of cultivation and of the different size of\r\ncrop, he recommends that a small plot of ground be reserved at each\r\nstation, adjacent to the soil thermometers, where the samples may be\r\ntaken for the moisture determinations. No crops should be allowed to\r\ngrow on this area and the soil is not to be disturbed, except that weeds\r\nand grass are carefully removed by hand when necessary. Samples of the\r\nsoil should be taken every morning at 8 o’clock, by correspondents in\r\nthe principal soil formations from the different parts of the area under\r\nobservation, and sent by mail to the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe samples should be taken as described in paragraph =65=. The locality\r\nand date are written on a label attached to the tube. The tube contains\r\nabout sixty or seventy grams of soil, and the moisture determination is\r\nmade on this in the laboratory in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable to have this sample represent a depth of from six\r\nto nine inches, thus rejecting the surface three inches which are more\r\nliable to sudden and accidental changes. These tubes are very\r\ninexpensive, and a sufficient number should be purchased to keep each\r\nstation supplied. The sample represents a definite depth, and it does\r\nnot have to be subsampled or even transferred in the field. This record\r\nof the moisture of the soil will show the amount of moisture which the\r\ndifferent soils can maintain at the disposal of the plants, which,\r\ntogether with the temperature of the soil, is believed to be a most\r\nimportant factor in crop distribution and development.\r\n\r\n=295. Method of Berthelot and André.=—The estimation of the water\r\naccording to Berthelot and André[189] should be made under three forms;\r\n_viz._,\r\n\r\n1. Water eliminated spontaneously at ordinary temperatures.\r\n\r\n2. Water eliminated by drying to constant weight at 110°.\r\n\r\n3. Water eliminated at a red heat.\r\n\r\nThe water may be determined directly on a sample weighed at the time of\r\ntaking and afterwards dried in the open air, and finally, if necessary,\r\nin a desiccator. For a general idea the desiccation should be made on a\r\nsample of 100 grams, for exact work on ten grams. The dish in which the\r\ndrying takes place should be shallow, and during the time the sample\r\nshould be frequently stirred and thoroughly pulverized with a spatula\r\nwhich is weighed with the dish. The drying in the air should continue\r\nseveral days. The data obtained are not fixed since they depend on the\r\ntemperature and the degree of saturation of the air with aqueous vapor.\r\nThe variations due to these causes, however, are not very wide. The\r\nprocess may be regarded as practically finished when successive weights\r\nsensibly constant are obtained. In this state the soils contain very\r\nlittle water eliminable at 110°.\r\n\r\n=296. Estimation of Water Remaining after Air-Drying.=—The sifted sample\r\nis placed in quantities of five or ten grams in a flat-bottomed dish and\r\ndried at 110° to constant weight. This treatment not only removes the\r\nmoisture, but all matters volatile at that temperature.\r\n\r\nPetermann,[190] in the Agricultural Station, at Gembloux, practices\r\ndrying the sample to constant weight at 150°.\r\n\r\nIt is further recommended by Petermann to determine total volatile and\r\ncombustible matters by igniting to incipient redness, allowing to cool,\r\nmoistening with distilled water, and drying at 150°.\r\n\r\nThe German experiment stations[3] estimate hygroscopic moisture for\r\nanalytical calculations by drying to constant weight at 100°. In\r\ndetermining loss on ignition, however, the preliminary drying is made at\r\n140°, with the exception of peaty samples where so high a temperature is\r\nnot admissible.\r\n\r\nThe Official Agricultural Chemists[191] place five grams of air-dried\r\nsoil in a flat-bottomed and tared platinum dish; heat in an air-bath to\r\n110° for eight hours; cool in a desiccator, and weigh; repeat the\r\nheating, cooling, and weighing, at intervals of an hour till constant\r\nweight is found, and estimate the hygroscopic moisture by the loss of\r\nweight. Weigh rapidly to avoid absorption of moisture from the air.\r\n\r\nIn the German laboratories, according to König,[192] from ten to twenty\r\ngrams of the fine earth, properly prepared by air-drying and sifting,\r\nfor analysis, are heated at 100° to constant weight. For control, five\r\ngrams are placed in a desiccator over sulfuric acid for two or three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nWolff directs that a small portion of the well-mixed earth, for example,\r\ntwenty grams, be spread out on a flat zinc plate, and its changes in\r\nweight observed through several days. These observations are continued\r\nuntil the variations are so slight that the means can be determined with\r\nsufficient exactness from the last weighings. The soil is then dried at\r\n125° in a hot air-chamber. The loss in weight will give the mean\r\nhygroscopic moisture in the soil under the conditions in which the\r\nexperiment is made.\r\n\r\n=297. Drying in a Desiccator.=—The sample dried as indicated previously\r\nby the method of Berthelot and André is placed in a desiccator over\r\nsulfuric acid. It is better to have the sample traversed by a current of\r\nperfectly dry air, and in this case it should be placed in a tube, which\r\nis closed while weighing, to prevent absorption of moisture. Much time\r\nis also required for this operation, and it does not possess the\r\npractical value of the method of drying in the free air.\r\n\r\n=298. Water Set Free at 110°.=—This is determined by Berthelot and André\r\non a weight of five to ten grams of soil. The sample which has been\r\nemployed for the preceding determination may be used. While this is\r\ngoing on in an air-bath heated to 110°, about ten times as much soil\r\nshould be dried for the same time at the same temperature, and this\r\nshould be preserved in a well-stoppered flask. All subsequent\r\ndeterminations are to be made with the soil dried at 110°.\r\n\r\nThe loss of weight in a soil increases with the temperature to which it\r\nis exposed. The apparent quantity of water, therefore, determined at\r\n140° or 180° is always greater than that obtained at 110°. But when the\r\ntemperature exceeds 110° there is danger of decomposing organic bodies\r\nwith the loss of a part of their constituent elements. Carbon dioxid and\r\nammonia may also be lost, as well as acetic acid and other volatile\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n=299. Loss on Ignition.=—The loss on ignition represents any hygroscopic\r\nmoisture not removed by previous drying, all water in combination with\r\nmineral matters as water of constitution, all organic acids and\r\nammoniacal compounds, all organic matter when the ignition is continued\r\nuntil the carbon is burned away, all or nearly all of the carbon dioxid\r\npresent in carbonates, and, finally, some of the chlorids of the\r\nalkalies, if the temperature have been carried too high or been\r\ncontinued too long.\r\n\r\nThe loss of carbon dioxid in carbonates may be mostly restored by\r\nmoistening the ignited mass two or three times with ammonium carbonate,\r\nfollowed by gentle ignition for a few minutes to incipient redness, to\r\nremove excess of the reagent. The apportionment of the rest of the loss\r\njustly among the remaining volatile constituents of the original sample\r\nis a matter of some difficulty but may be approximately effected by the\r\nmethods to be submitted.\r\n\r\n=300. Determination of Loss on Ignition.=—_Method of the Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists._ The platinum crucible and five grams of soil\r\nused to determine the hygroscopic moisture may be employed to determine\r\nthe volatile matter. Heat the crucible and dry soil to low redness. The\r\nheating should be prolonged till all organic material is burned away,\r\nbut below the temperature at which alkaline chlorids volatilize. Moisten\r\nthe cold mass with a few drops of a saturated solution of ammonium\r\ncarbonate, dry, and heat to 150° to expel excess of ammonia. The loss in\r\nweight of the sample represents organic matter, water of combination,\r\nsalts of ammonia, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to Knop[193] the total loss on ignition is determined as\r\nfollows: About two grams of the fine earth are carefully ignited until\r\nall organic matter is consumed. The sample is then mixed with an equal\r\nvolume of finely powdered, pure oxalic acid, and again heated until all\r\nthe oxalic acid is decomposed. After cooling, the sample is weighed,\r\nagain mixed with oxalic acid, ignited, cooled, weighed, and the process\r\ncontinued until the weight is constant.\r\n\r\nThe method recommended by König consists in igniting about ten grams of\r\nthe fine earth at the lowest possible temperature until all the humus is\r\ndestroyed. Thereafter the sample is repeatedly moistened with a solution\r\nof ammonium carbonate and ignited after drying at 100°, until constant\r\nweight is obtained. In soils rich in carbonates some carbon dioxid may\r\nbe lost by the above process. For this a proper correction can be made\r\nby estimating the carbon dioxid in the sample, both before and after the\r\nexecution of the above described process.\r\n\r\nThe method described by Frühling as much used in the German\r\nlaboratories, consists in igniting ten grams of the fine earth,\r\npreviously dried at 140° in a crucible placed obliquely on its support\r\nand with the cover so adjusted over its mouth as to give a draft within\r\nthe body of the crucible. The ignition, at a gentle heat is continued\r\nuntil on stirring with a platinum wire no evidence of unconsumed carbon\r\nis found. The moistening with solution of ammonium carbonate, should not\r\ntake place until the contents of the crucible are cool. Subsequent\r\nignition, at a low heat for a short time, will remove the excess of\r\nammonium salt.\r\n\r\n=301. Method of Berthelot and André.=[194]—The earth dried at 110°\r\ncontains still a greater or less quantity of combined water. This is the\r\nwater united with alumina, silica and certain salts, but not the water\r\nof constitution belonging to organic bodies. The exact estimation of\r\nthis water offers many difficulties. The determination of loss obtained\r\nat a red heat embraces:\r\n\r\n(1) The water combined with zeolitic silicates, with alumina and with\r\norganic compounds.\r\n\r\n(2) The water produced by the combustion of the organic compounds.\r\n\r\n(3) The carbon dioxid resulting from the partial decomposition of the\r\ncalcium and magnesium carbonates.\r\n\r\n(4) The carbon burned and the nitrogen lost during ignition. The measure\r\nof the loss of weight in an earth heated to redness in contact with the\r\nair is not therefore, an exact process of estimating water or even\r\nvolatile matters.\r\n\r\nA better defined result is obtained in carefully burning a known weight\r\nof earth either in a current of free oxygen, or with lead chromate. The\r\nwater produced in such a combustion is secured in a =ᥩ= tube filled with\r\npumice stone saturated with sulfuric acid, the carbon dioxid being\r\nabsorbed afterwards in potash bulbs and by solid potash. The weight of\r\nearth burned is chosen so as to furnish a convenient weight of both\r\nwater and carbon dioxid. In general about five grams are sufficient.\r\nWhen the combustion is made with oxygen, the soil is contained in a boat\r\nand the products of the combustion are carried over a long column of\r\ncopper oxid heated to redness. The residue left in the boat is weighed\r\nat the end of the operation, and in this residue it is advisable to\r\ndetermine any undecomposed carbonate. Should the sample burn badly and\r\nbe mixed with carbonaceous matter at the end of the operation, it will\r\nbe necessary to substitute the lead chromate method. In this case, of\r\ncourse, the residue left after combustion is not weighed. Whichever\r\nmethod is employed gives a quantity of water originally combined with\r\nthe soil, plus the quantity arising from the combustion of the hydrogen\r\nof the organic matter. The details of the processes for organic\r\ncombustion, will be given in a subsequent part of this manual. It is not\r\npossible to divide the water between these two sources directly, but\r\nthis can be done by calculation, which gives results lying within the\r\nlimits of probability. The method follows:\r\n\r\nThe organic nitrogen, determined separately, by soda-lime, the method of\r\nKjeldahl, or volumetrically, is derived from proteid principles\r\nresembling albuminoids containing about one-sixteenth of their weight of\r\nnitrogen. The nitrates contained in the earth are in such feeble\r\nproportion, as to be negligible in this calculation. The total weight of\r\nthese nitrogenous principles in the soil is therefore easily calculated.\r\nThe carbon contained in the proteids is then calculated on a basis of 53\r\nper cent of their total weight, and the hydrogen on a basis of 7.2 per\r\ncent. From the weight of the total organic carbon (determined as\r\ndescribed further on) is subtracted the carbon present in the proteids.\r\nThe remainder corresponds to the organic carbon present as\r\ncarbohydrates, (ligneous principles) containing 44.4 per cent carbon and\r\n6.2 per cent hydrogen. By adding together the weight of the hydrogen\r\ncontained in the ligneous principles, and the hydrogen contained in the\r\nproteids, and multiplying the sum by 9, the weight of water formed by\r\nthe combustion of all the organic matter in the sample is obtained. This\r\nis subtracted from the weight of the total water obtained by direct\r\ndetermination as described above. The difference represents the weight\r\nof water combined with the silicates, etc., as well as with organic\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n=302. Method of Von Bemmelén.=[195]—According to the view of Von\r\nBemmelén, the soil contains colloidal humus and colloidal silicate,\r\nwhich complicate the determination of water. The colloids retain water\r\nin varying quantities, depending upon the following conditions:\r\n\r\n(1) Upon their composition and state of molecular equilibrium.\r\n\r\n(2) Upon the pressure of the aqueous vapor of the room.\r\n\r\n(3) Upon the temperature.\r\n\r\nAt each degree of temperature, the quantity of absorbed water which a\r\ncolloid can retain in a room saturated with aqueous vapor, is different.\r\nThe quantity of water which air-dried earth gives off at 100°, has\r\ntherefore, no special significance unless all conditions are known.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the estimation of the quantity of water which soils, in\r\ntheir natural condition, are capable of taking up and holding, at\r\nordinary temperatures, the estimation of the quantity of water which\r\nthey can take up in different temperatures in rooms saturated with\r\naqueous vapor should be of interest. It follows, therefore, that there\r\nis no special value in data obtained by drying earth at 100° or 110°.\r\nFor the purpose of comparison, he prefers to select that point at which\r\nthe soil is dried over sulfuric acid, the point at which the tension of\r\nthe water vapor in the earth, at a temperature of plus or minus 15°,\r\napproaches zero. The water which still remains in the earth under these\r\nconditions is characterized as firmly combined water.\r\n\r\nVon Bemmelén truly observes that only in soils which contain no\r\ncarbonates and no chlorids and sulfids, can the loss on ignition be\r\nregarded as the sum of the humus and water content. By moistening with\r\nammonium carbonate, the correction for lime or carbon dioxid cannot be\r\ncorrectly made as has been the custom up to the present time. In the\r\nfirst place, ignited magnesia, when it has lost its carbon dioxid, does\r\nnot take this up completely on moistening with ammonium carbonate; in\r\nthe second place, reactions with the chlorids may take place; and in the\r\nthird place, the lime which is in the humus will be converted into\r\ncalcium carbonate. Chlorids on ignition may be volatilized or oxidized.\r\nThe sulfuric acid formed from the sulfids, on ignition, can expel carbon\r\ndioxid; further than this the iron of pyrites takes up oxygen on\r\nignition. All these influences make the numbers obtained from loss on\r\nignition extremely variable.\r\n\r\nWith sea soils, Von Bemmelén has weighed the soil after the elementary\r\nanalysis and estimated, in addition to the carbon dioxid, both chlorin\r\nand sulfuric acid therein. The comparison of these estimations with\r\nthose of CO₂, Cl, SO₃ and S, made in the original soil, gave the\r\nnecessary corrections; _viz._, for the increase in the weight through\r\noxidation of sulfur and iron, and for the decrease in weight through the\r\nvolatilization of sodium chlorid, sulfur, and carbon dioxid. A trace of\r\nchlorin was evolved as ferric chlorid, nevertheless, the molecular\r\nweight of sodium chlorid, 58.5, is scarcely different from the\r\nequivalent quantity of ferric chlorid 54.1. For this reason the\r\nestimation of loss of water, on ignition, of sea soils is less exact\r\nthan that of soils which are free from carbonates and sulfids and which,\r\nas is usually the case with tillable soils, contain only small\r\nquantities of chlorids and sulfates.\r\n\r\n_The Strongly Combined Water._—Water which, at a temperature of plus or\r\nminus 15°, in a dry room, still remains in the soil, is chiefly combined\r\naccording to Von Bemmelén with the colloidal bodies therein. Its\r\nestimation, presents, naturally, difficulties and is not capable of any\r\ngreat exactness. The quantity of strongly combined water, on the one\r\nhand is determined from the difference between the loss on ignition and\r\nthe quantity of humus present, calculated from the content of carbon; on\r\nthe other hand, from the difference between the water obtained by\r\nelementary analysis and the water which corresponds to the calculated\r\nquantity of humus. If the hydrogen content of humus is correctly taken\r\nand no appreciable error is introduced through the factor 1.724, both of\r\nthese differences must agree. On the other hand the hydrogen content of\r\nthe humus can be computed from the difference between the water found\r\nand the calculated content of the firmly combined water.\r\n\r\nThe hydrogen content of humus bodies, dried at 100°, varies between four\r\nand five per cent. Eggertz has found the content from 4.3 to 6.6 per\r\ncent of hydrogen in thirteen soils which he first treated with dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid then extracted with ammonia or potash lye and\r\nprecipitated this alkaline extract with acid. The method of applying\r\nthese principles to soil analysis is indicated in the following scheme:\r\n\r\nA volcanic earth from Deli gave, on elementary analysis:\r\n\r\n                                                 Per cent.\r\n              Carbon                                  2.94\r\n              Water                                  14.78\r\n              Nitrogen                                0.28\r\n              Loss on ignition                       17.54\r\n\r\n                           FIRST CALCULATION.\r\n                                                 Per cent.\r\n              Loss on ignition                       17.54\r\n              Humus = carbon, 2.94 × 1.724 =          5.07\r\n              Difference = firmly combined water     12.47\r\n\r\nAssuming that a humus dried over sulfuric acid contains five per cent of\r\nhydrogen, the second calculation is made as follows.\r\n\r\n                          SECOND CALCULATION.\r\n\r\n              5.00 humus × 5 per cent = 0.25 per cent of\r\n              hydrogen in humus corresponding to 2.28 per\r\n              cent of water.\r\n\r\n                                                 Per cent.\r\n              Water found                            14.79\r\n              Difference = firmly combined water     12.51\r\n\r\n                           THIRD CALCULATION.\r\n\r\n                                                 Per cent.\r\n              Firmly combined water                  12.47\r\n              Water from the hydrogen in humus        2.28\r\n              Total water                            14.75\r\n              Found                                  14.79\r\n\r\nIn this way, in three other volcanic earths and in an ordinary alluvial\r\nclay from Rembang, there were found by analysis and by calculation the\r\nfollowing percentages of water:\r\n\r\n                                        1.    2.   3.   4.   5.\r\n        Percentage of water calculated 14.75 7.74 8.06 4.90 6.01\r\n           „      „    „    found      14.97 7.63 8.05 4.70 6.00\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when the calculation is made from sea-slime taken from\r\nunder the water a higher content of hydrogen must be assumed; _viz._,\r\nabout six per cent. In two samples of sea-slime calculated in this way\r\nthe following numbers were obtained:\r\n\r\n                Percentage of water calculated 8.61 3.71\r\n                   „      „    „    found      8.53 3.57\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, quite evident that the organic compounds of soil taken\r\nfrom under the sea-water are richer in hydrogen than those exposed to\r\nthe air or in cultivation.\r\n\r\n=303. General Conclusions.=—In the foregoing paragraphs have been\r\ncollected the most widely practiced methods of determining moisture in\r\nsoil in both a free and combined state. The following conclusions may\r\nserve to guide the analyst who endeavors to determine the water in any\r\nor all of its conditions:\r\n\r\n(1) In determining water in fresh samples the method of Whitney is\r\nsatisfactory. Although the samples taken by this method are small they\r\nmay be easily secured in great numbers over widely scattered areas, and\r\ncan be easily transported without change. These samples should be dried\r\nat 100° to 110° for rapid work, or where time can be spared may be\r\nair-dried.\r\n\r\n(2) For a simple determination of the water left in the soil after\r\nair-drying (hygroscopic water) the method of the Association of Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists may be followed. There is much difference of\r\nopinion in respect of the proper temperature at which this moisture is\r\nto be determined. Much here depends on the nature of the soil. An almost\r\npurely mineral soil may safely be dried at 140° or 150°. A peaty soil,\r\non the contrary, should not be exposed to a temperature above 100°. For\r\ngeneral purposes the temperature chosen by the official chemists is to\r\nbe recommended.\r\n\r\n(3) Water of composition can only be determined by ignition. As has been\r\nfully shown, this process not only eliminates the water, but also\r\ndestroys organic matter, decomposes carbonates and sulfids, and, to some\r\nextent, chlorids. Subsequent repeated treatment with ammonium carbonate\r\nmay restore the loss due to carbon dioxid, but in many cases not\r\nentirely. The water which comes from organic matter may be approximately\r\ncalculated from the humus content of the sample, but as will be seen\r\nfurther on the methods of estimating humus itself are only approximate.\r\nNevertheless, in distributing the losses on ignition properly to the\r\nseveral compounds of the soil there is no better method now known than\r\nthat of taking into consideration the humus content and carbonates\r\npresent. The principles of procedure established by Berthelot and André,\r\nand Von Bemmelén, are to be applied in all such cases, modified as\r\ncircumstances may arise according to the judgment of the analyst.\r\n\r\n=304. Estimation of the Organic Matter of the Soil.=—The organic matter\r\nin the soil may be divided into two classes. First, the undecayed roots\r\nand other remains of plant and animal life, and the living organisms\r\nexisting in the soil. The study of the organisms which are active in the\r\ncondition of plant growth will be the subject of a special chapter.\r\nSecond, the decayed or partially decayed remnants of organic matter in\r\nthe soil known as humus. Such matter may be present in only minute\r\ntraces, as in barren sand soils, or it may form the great mass of the\r\nsoil under examination, as in the case of peat, muck, and vegetable\r\nmold. It is with the investigation of the second class of matter that\r\nthe analyst has chiefly to do at present. The problems which are to be\r\nelucidated by the analytical study of such bodies are the following: (1)\r\nThe total quantity of such matter in the soil. (2) The determination of\r\nthe organic carbon and hydrogen therein. (3) The determination of total\r\nnitrogen. (4) The determination of the availability of the nitrogen for\r\nplant growth. (5) The estimation of the humic bodies (humus, humic acid,\r\nulmic acid, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe importance of humus in the promotion of plant growth is sufficient\r\nexcuse for the somewhat extended study of the principles which underlie\r\nthe analytical methods, and the methods themselves, which follow.\r\n\r\n=305. Total Quantity of Organic Matter.=—The total approximate quantity\r\nof organic matter in the soil can be determined by simple ignition, in\r\nthe manner noted in paragraphs =294= and =295=. The proper correction\r\nfor free and combined water being applied by the further copper oxid or\r\nlead chromate combustion of the sample, and for carbonates and volatile\r\nchlorids, the approximate total of the organic matter of all kinds is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n=306. Estimation of the Organic Carbon.=—To estimate the organic carbon\r\nin an earth the sample may be burned in a current of oxygen, or after\r\nmixing with lead chromate.\r\n\r\n_In a Current of Oxygen._—When burned in a current of oxygen the sample\r\nis held in a boat and the gases arising from the combustion directed\r\nover copper oxid at a red heat. The carbon thus disappears as carbon\r\ndioxid and is absorbed and weighed in the usual way.\r\n\r\n_With Lead Chromate._—The lead chromate employed should be previously\r\ntested since it often contains other compounds, especially lead acetate\r\nand nitrate, furnishing in the one case both carbon dioxid and water,\r\nand in the other hyponitric acid.\r\n\r\nFrom two to ten grams of earth are employed, according to its richness\r\nin organic matter. The total carbon dioxid is obtained in this process\r\nboth from carbonates and organic bodies. The water and carbon dioxid are\r\nsecured and weighed in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen method should be used in all cases possible. Although it does\r\nnot always give the whole of the carbon dioxid present as carbonates,\r\nthe rest can be easily estimated by treating the residue in the boat\r\nwith hydrochloric acid, in an apparatus for estimating that gas.\r\n\r\n_Calculation of Results._—The whole of the carbon dioxid is determined\r\neither by direct combustion with lead chromate, or by taking the sum of\r\nthe amounts by burning in a stream of oxygen and treating the residue in\r\na carbon dioxid apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe carbon dioxid contained in the original carbonates should be\r\ndetermined by direct treatment of the sample in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe carbon in organic compounds is determined by subtracting the carbon\r\npresent as carbonates from the total.\r\n\r\nFrom the organic carbon contained in the soil the humus is calculated by\r\nWolff on the supposition that it contains fifty-eight per cent of\r\ncarbon. It is, therefore, only necessary to multiply the percentage of\r\ncarbon found by 1.724, or the carbon dioxid found by 0.471, to determine\r\nthe quantity of humus in the dried soil.\r\n\r\n=307. Details of the Direct Estimation of Carbon in Soils by Various\r\nMethods.=—(1) _Oxidation by Chromic Acid._—The method of Wolff by\r\noxidation with chromic acid has been worked out in detail by Warington\r\nand Peake.[196] It consists in treating the soil with sulfuric acid and\r\npotassium bichromate, or by preference with a mixture of sulfuric and\r\nchromic acids, the carbon dioxid evolved being estimated in the usual\r\nway. This method is recommended by Fresenius as an alternative to a\r\ncombustion of the soil with copper oxid or lead chromate. It is\r\napparently the method which has been most generally employed in\r\nagricultural investigations.\r\n\r\nTen grams of the finely powdered soil are placed in a flask of about 250\r\ncubic centimeters capacity, provided with a caoutchouc stopper, through\r\nwhich pass two tubes, one for the supply of liquids, the other for the\r\ndelivery of gas. The soil is treated with twenty cubic centimeters of\r\nwater and thirty cubic centimeters of oil of vitriol; and the whole,\r\nafter being thoroughly mixed, is heated for a short time in a\r\nwater-bath, the object in view being the decomposition of any carbonates\r\nexisting in the soil. Air is next drawn through the flask to remove any\r\ncarbon dioxid which has been evolved. The stopper is next removed, and\r\ncoarsely powdered potassium bichromate introduced. In the case of a soil\r\ncontaining three per cent of carbon, six grams of bichromate will be\r\nfound sufficient, a portion remaining undissolved at the end of the\r\nexperiment. The stopper is then replaced, its supply-tube closed by a\r\nclamp, and the delivery-tube connected with a series of absorbents\r\ncontained in =ᥩ= tubes. The first of these tubes contains solid calcium\r\nchlorid; the second, fragments of glass moistened with oil of vitriol;\r\nthe third and fourth are nearly filled with soda-lime, a little calcium\r\nchlorid being placed on the top of the soda-lime at each extremity. The\r\nlast named tubes are for the absorption of carbon dioxid, and have been\r\npreviously weighed. The series is closed by a guard-tube containing\r\nsoda-lime, with calcium chlorid at the two ends.\r\n\r\nThe flask containing the soil and bichromate is now gradually heated in\r\na water-bath, the contents of the flask being from time to time mixed by\r\nagitation. A brisk reaction occurs, carbon dioxid being evolved in\r\nproportion as the soil is rich in organic matter. The temperature of the\r\nwater-bath is slowly raised to boiling as the action becomes weaker, and\r\nis maintained at that point till all action ceases. As bubbles of gas\r\nare slowly evolved for some time, it has been usual in these experiments\r\nto prolong the digestion for four or five hours. When the operation is\r\nconcluded the source of heat is removed, an aspirator is attached to the\r\nguard-tube at the end of the absorbent vessels, and air freed from\r\ncarbon dioxid is drawn through the flask and through the whole series of\r\n=ᥩ= tubes. The =ᥩ= tubes filled with soda-lime are finally weighed, the\r\nincrease in weight showing the amount of carbon dioxid produced. The\r\nobject of the calcium chlorid placed on the surface of the soda-lime is\r\nto retain the water which is freely given up when the soda-lime absorbs\r\ncarbon dioxid. The second =ᥩ= tube filled with soda-lime does not gain\r\nin weight till the first is nearly saturated; it thus serves to indicate\r\nwhen the first tube requires refilling. The same tubes may be used\r\nseveral times in succession.\r\n\r\nNo increase in the carbon dioxid evolved is obtained by substituting\r\nchromic acid for potassium bichromate.\r\n\r\nThe organic matter of the soil appears to the eye to be completely\r\ndestroyed by the digestion with sulfuric acid and potassium bichromate;\r\nthe residue of soil remaining in the flask when washed with water is\r\nperfectly white, or the dark particles, if any, are found to be\r\nunaltered by ignition, and therefore to be inorganic in their nature.\r\nUnder these circumstances considerable confidence has naturally been\r\nfelt in this method. The complete destruction of the humic matter of the\r\nsoil does not, however, necessarily imply that the carbon has been\r\nentirely converted into carbon dioxid as has been pointed out by\r\nWanklyn. According to his demonstration of the action of chromic acid on\r\norganic matter the oxidation frequently stops short of the production of\r\ncarbon dioxid. While oxidation with chromic acid apparently leads to a\r\ncomplete reaction when the carbon is in the form of graphite, it would\r\nprobably yield other products than carbon dioxid when the carbon exists\r\nas a carbohydrate. The doubt thus raised as to the correctness of the\r\nresults yielded by the chromate method makes it desirable to check the\r\nwork by the use of other methods for the determination of carbon. For\r\nthis purpose Warington and Peake recommend:\r\n\r\n(2) _Oxidation with Potassium Permanganate._—In the trials with this\r\nmethod ten grams of soil are digested in a closed flask with a measured\r\nquantity of solution of caustic potash containing five grams of potash\r\nfor each twenty cubic centimeters, and crystals of potassium\r\npermanganate. Seven grams of the permanganate are found to be sufficient\r\nfor a soil containing 3.3 per cent of carbon. The flask is heated for\r\nhalf an hour in boiling water, and then for one hour in a salt-bath. The\r\nflask during this digestion is connected with a small receiver\r\ncontaining a little potash solution, to preserve an atmosphere free from\r\ncarbon dioxid; distillation to a limited extent is allowed during the\r\ndigestion in the salt-bath.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the operation being completed a rubber stopper,\r\ncarrying a delivery and supply-tube, is fitted to the flask, which is\r\nthen connected with the system of =ᥩ= tubes already described. Dilute\r\nsulfuric acid is then poured down the supply-tube, a water-bath\r\nsurrounding the flask is brought to boiling, and maintained thus for one\r\nhour, after which air, free from carbon dioxid, is drawn through the\r\napparatus, the =ᥩ= tubes containing soda-lime being finally disconnected\r\nand weighed.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage of this method the carbon of the organic matter is\r\nconverted into carbonate, and probably also into potassium oxalate.[197]\r\nIn the second stage the oxalate is decomposed by the sulfuric acid and\r\npermanganate, and the carbon existing, both as oxalate and carbonate, is\r\nevolved as carbon dioxid, and absorbed by the weighed soda-lime tubes.\r\nBoth F. Schulze and Wanklyn have employed potassium permanganate for the\r\ndetermination of organic carbon, but they have preferred to calculate\r\nthe amount of carbon from the quantity of permanganate consumed, as,\r\nhowever, by so doing everything oxidizable by permanganate is reckoned\r\nas carbon, it seems better to make a direct determination of the carbon\r\ndioxid formed.\r\n\r\nFrom the amount of carbon dioxid found, is to be subtracted that\r\nexisting as carbonates in the soil, and in the solution of potash used.\r\nFor this purpose an experiment is made with the same quantities of soil\r\nand potash previously employed, but without permanganate, and the carbon\r\ndioxid obtained is deducted from that yielded in the experiment with\r\npermanganate. If the potash used contains organic matter two blank\r\nexperiments will be necessary, one with potash and permanganate, and one\r\nwith soil alone.\r\n\r\nA further difficulty arises from the presence of chlorids in the\r\nmaterials, which occasions an evolution of free chlorin when the\r\npermanganate solution is heated with sulfuric acid. This error occurs\r\nalso with the chromic acid method, but in that case the quantity of\r\nchlorid is merely that contained in the soil, which is usually very\r\nsmall; in the permanganate method we have also the chlorid present in\r\nthe caustic potash, and this is often considerable. Corrections for\r\nchlorin by blank experiments are unsatisfactory, the amount of chlorin\r\nwhich reaches the soda-lime tubes depending in part on the degree to\r\nwhich the calcium chlorid tube has become saturated with chlorin. It is\r\nbetter therefore to remove the chlorin in every experiment by the plan\r\nwhich Perkin has suggested, by inserting a tube containing silver foil,\r\nmaintained at a low red heat, between the flask and the absorbent =ᥩ=\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nThe amount of carbon dioxid yielded by oxidation with potassium\r\npermanganate is found to be considerably in excess of that obtained by\r\noxidation with chromic acid; to ascertain whether these higher results\r\nreally represented the whole of the carbon present in the soil, trials\r\nwere next made by actual combustion of the soil in oxygen.\r\n\r\n(3) _Combustion in Oxygen._—The most convenient mode of carrying out the\r\ncombustion of soil is to place the soil in a platinum boat, and ignite\r\nit in a current of oxygen in a combustion tube partly filled with cupric\r\noxid. A wide combustion tube is employed, about twenty inches long, and\r\ndrawn out at one end; the front of the tube is filled for eight inches\r\nwith coarse cupric oxid, the hind part is left empty to receive the\r\nplatinum boat. The drawn out end of the combustion tube is connected\r\nwith a series of absorbent =ᥩ= tubes, quite similar to those employed\r\nfor the estimation of carbon dioxid in the chromic acid method. Between\r\nthese absorbent vessels and the combustion tube is placed a three-bulbed\r\nGeissler tube filled with oil of vitriol. The oil of vitriol is quite\r\neffective in retaining nitrous fumes. The wide end of the combustion\r\ntube is connected with a gas-holder of oxygen; the oxygen gas is made to\r\npass through a =ᥩ= tube of soda-lime before entering the combustion\r\ntube, to remove any possible contamination of carbon dioxid.\r\n\r\nIn starting a combustion the part of the combustion tube containing the\r\ncupric oxid is brought to a red heat, and oxygen is passed for some time\r\nthrough the apparatus. Ten grams of soil, previously dried, are placed\r\nin a large platinum boat, which is next introduced at the wide end of\r\nthe combustion tube. The combustion is conducted in the usual manner, a\r\ncurrent of oxygen being maintained throughout the whole operation. It is\r\nvery useful to terminate the whole series of absorbent vessels with a\r\nglass tube dipping into water; the rate at which the gas is seen to\r\nbubble, serves as a guide to the supply of oxygen from the gas-holder,\r\nthe consumption of oxygen varying, of course, with different soils, and\r\nat different stages of the combustion. At the close of the combustion,\r\noxygen, or air freed from carbon dioxid, is passed for some time through\r\nthe apparatus to drive all carbon dioxid into the absorbent vessels. One\r\nexperiment can be followed by another as soon as the hind part of the\r\ncombustion tube has cooled sufficiently to admit a second platinum boat.\r\nThe same combustion tube can be employed for several days, if packed in\r\nthe usual manner in asbestos.\r\n\r\nThe presence of carbonates in the soil occasions some difficulty in\r\nworking the combustion method, as a part of this carbon dioxid will, of\r\ncourse, be given up on ignition, and be reckoned as carbon. The simplest\r\nmode of meeting this difficulty is to expel the carbon dioxid belonging\r\nto the carbonates before the combustion commences. The method of\r\nManning; namely, treatment with a strong solution of sulfurous acid, may\r\nbe employed for this purpose. The ten grams of soil taken for combustion\r\nare placed in a flat-bottomed basin, covered with a thin layer of\r\nsulfurous acid, and frequently stirred. After a time the action is\r\nassisted by a gentle heat. When the carbonates have been completely\r\ndecomposed the contents of the basin are evaporated to dryness on a\r\nwater-bath; the dry mass is then pulverized, and removed to the platinum\r\nboat for combustion in oxygen. For the action of the sulfurous acid to\r\nbe complete it is essential that the carbonates should be in very fine\r\npowder, since even chalk is but imperfectly attacked when present in\r\ncoarse particles.\r\n\r\n=308. Comparison of Methods.=—A considerable number of soils analyzed by\r\nthe chromic acid method and by the combustion, method, by Warington and\r\nPeake, with the assistance of Cathcart, shows the following comparisons:\r\n\r\n    PERCENTAGE OF CARBON FOUND BY TWO METHODS IN SOILS DRIED AT 100°.\r\n\r\n                  Chromic acid method.

The two\r\nsoils in question were treated with sulfurous acid before combustion,\r\nthe others not.\r\n\r\nAll the determinations by the chromic acid method were made by Mr. P. H.\r\nCathcart, with the exception of Nos. 9 and 12, which were executed by\r\nanother experimenter, and are seen to give distinctly lower results.\r\nExcluding these two analyses the relation of the carbon found by the two\r\nmethods is tolerably constant, the average being 79.9 of carbon found by\r\noxidation with chromic acid for 100 yielded by combustion in oxygen. The\r\nresults obtained by the chromic acid method thus appear to be very\r\nconsiderably below the truth.\r\n\r\nFour typical soils were analyzed by the permanganate, as well as by the\r\nchromic acid and combustion methods. The results obtained were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   PERCENTAGE OF CARBON FOUND BY THREE METHODS IN SOILS DRIED AT 100°.\r\n\r\n                                    Permanganate method.\r\n   Kind of              Chromic                              Yielded by\r\n    soil.                 acid                              permanganate\r\n             Combustion method.                             if carbon by\r\n              method.

In making this calculation they have taken as the amount of\r\ncarbon in the soil, that found by combustion in oxygen, and have assumed\r\nwith Schulze, Wolff, and Fresenius, that fifty-eight per cent of carbon\r\nwill be present in the organic matter of soils. The four soils were\r\nheated successively at 100°, 120°, and 150°, till they ceased to lose\r\nweight; the loss on ignition in each of these stages of dryness is shown\r\nin the following table:\r\n\r\n  PERCENTAGE LOSS ON IGNITION COMPARED WITH ORGANIC MATTER CALCULATED\r\n                             FROM CARBON.\r\n\r\n                                                            Organic\r\n                                                           matter at\r\n                                                          fifty-eight\r\n               Between 100°  Between 120°  Between 150°    per cent\r\n               and ignition. and ignition. and ignition.    carbon.\r\n Kind of soil.

The error of the\r\nignition method is least in soils rich in organic matter, as, for\r\ninstance, the old pasture soil in the above table. The error reaches its\r\nmaximum in the case of the clay subsoil, which contains very little\r\ncarbonaceous matter, but is naturally rich in hydrated silicates, which\r\npart with their water only at a very high temperature.\r\n\r\nThe above methods of Warington and Peake have been given in detail, and\r\nin almost the verbiage of the authors for the reason that the working\r\ndirections are clearly set forth, and may serve, therefore, as guides to\r\nthe previous methods where only general indications of manipulation have\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\n=309. Estimation of Organic Hydrogen.=—The estimation of the total\r\nhydrogen is made without difficulty either by burning the sample in a\r\ncurrent of oxygen or with lead chromate, and weighing the water\r\nproduced. This water comes from two sources, the pre-existing water and\r\norganic hydrogen. There is no direct method of distinguishing one from\r\nthe other. They may, however, be estimated indirectly. The method of\r\ncalculating the organic hydrogen has already been given (paragraph\r\n=299=). Experience shows that the hydrogen thus calculated is a little\r\ngreater than is necessary to form water with the whole of the oxygen\r\nfound in the organic matters.\r\n\r\n=310. Estimation of Organic Oxygen.=—The determination of this oxygen\r\ncannot be made directly. It is obtained by calculation, according to\r\nBerthelot and André,[198] from the oxygen in the proteid and ligneous\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nLet p represent the weight of the proteid bodies in a sample of soil.\r\n\r\nThen O = (p × 33.5)/(100)\r\n\r\nLet p′ = weight of ligneous bodies.\r\n\r\nThen O′ = (p′ × 49.4)/(100)\r\n\r\nThe total oxygen = O + O′.\r\n\r\nAn approximate result is thus obtained, very useful to have when account\r\nis taken of the oxidizing processes which go on in the soil during\r\nagricultural operations.\r\n\r\n=311. Estimation of Humus (Matière Noire).=—The original method of\r\ndetermining this substance is due to Grandeau.[199] It is carried on as\r\nfollows: Ten grams of the fine earth are mixed with coarse sand\r\npreviously washed with acids and ignited. The mixture is placed in a\r\nsmall funnel, the bottom of which is filled with fragments of glass or\r\nporcelain. The mass is moistened with ammonia diluted with an equal\r\nvolume of distilled water, and allowed to digest for three or four\r\nhours. The ammonia dissolves the dark matter without attacking the\r\nsilica. The ammoniacal solution is displaced by treating the mass with\r\npure water, or water to which some ammonia has been added, and the whole\r\nof the dark matter is thus obtained in a volume of twenty to fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of filtrate. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness in a\r\nweighed platinum dish, and the weight of residue is determined and the\r\npercentage of _matière noire_ calculated therefrom. The residue is\r\nincinerated, and when in sufficient quantity the phosphoric acid is\r\ndetermined in the ash. In soils poor in humus a larger quantity than ten\r\ngrams may be taken. If the soil be previously treated with hydrochloric\r\nacid, Grandeau recommends that the phosphoric acid be determined always\r\nin the ash of the dark matter.\r\n\r\nThe method has undergone various modifications and, as given by Hilgard,\r\nis now practiced as follows:\r\n\r\nAbout ten grams of soil are weighed into a prepared filter. The soil\r\nshould be covered with a piece of paper (a filter) so as to prevent it\r\nfrom packing when solvents are poured on it. It is now treated with\r\nhydrochloric acid from five-tenths per cent to one per cent strong\r\n(twenty-five and one-third cubic centimeters of strong acid and 808\r\ncubic centimeters of water) to dissolve the lime and magnesia which\r\nprevent the humus from dissolving in the ammonia. Treat with the acid\r\nuntil there is no reaction for lime; then wash out the acid with water\r\nto neutral reaction. Dissolve the humus with weak ammonia water,\r\nprepared by diluting common saturated ammonia water (178 cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonia to 422 cubic centimeters of water). Evaporate the\r\nhumus solution to dryness in a weighed platinum dish at 100°; weigh,\r\nthen ignite; the loss of weight gives the weight of humus.\r\n\r\nThe residue from ignition is carbonated with carbon dioxid, heated and\r\nweighed, thus giving the ash. It is then moistened with nitric acid and\r\nevaporated to dryness. The residue is treated with nitric acid and\r\nwater, allowed to stand a few hours, and the solution filtered from the\r\ninsoluble residue, which is ignited and weighed, giving the silica.\r\n\r\nThe soluble phosphoric acid is determined in the solution by the usual\r\nmethod, as magnesium pyrophosphate. It usually amounts to a fraction,\r\nvarying from one-half to as little as one-tenth of the total in the\r\nsoil. While the phosphoric acid so determined is manifestly more soluble\r\nand more available to vegetation than the rest of that found by\r\nextraction with stronger acid, it is clearly not as available as that\r\nwhich, when introduced in the form of superphosphates, exerts such\r\nstriking effects even though forming a much smaller percentage of the\r\nwhole soil. Nevertheless, very striking agreement with actual practice\r\nis often found in making this determination.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of humus by combustion, in any form, of the total organic\r\nmatter in the soil, gives results varying according to the season, and\r\nhaving no direct relation to the active humus of the soil. The same\r\nobjection lies against extraction with strong caustic lye.\r\n\r\n=312. Modification of Grandeau’s Method for Determining Humus in\r\nSoils.=—According to Huston and McBride[200] the function of the\r\nvegetable matter in the soil has long been a matter of contention among\r\nthose interested in the science of agriculture. Two factors have\r\ncontributed to the uncertainty existing in this matter: First, the very\r\ncomplex and varying nature of the compounds resulting from the\r\ndecomposition of vegetable matter in the soils; and second, the lack of\r\nuniformity in the methods of determining either the total amount of\r\norganic matter present in a soil, or the amount that has been so far\r\ndecomposed as to be of any immediate agricultural value. Prominent among\r\nthese methods are the methods in which a combustion is resorted to, the\r\nsubstance being either burned in air or in a combustion tube with some\r\nagent supplying oxygen. The loss on ignition is no measure of the amount\r\nof organic matter present since it is practically impossible to remove\r\nall the water from the soil previous to ignition, and neither of the\r\nmethods gives information regarding the extent of the decomposition of\r\nthe organic matter. Pure cellulose and the black matter of a fertile\r\nsoil are of very different agricultural value.\r\n\r\nDeterminations of carbon in soils by oxidation with chromic and sulfuric\r\nacid, and with alkaline permanganate have been used. The method with\r\nalkaline permanganate agrees fairly well with combustion with copper\r\noxid or lead chromate, but the chromic sulfuric acid method gives only\r\nabout eighty per cent of the carbon found by combustion processes.\r\nHowever valuable these processes may be for determining the total carbon\r\nin the soil, they furnish no information regarding the condition of the\r\ncarbonaceous soil constituents, and as the determination is really one\r\nof carbon, the organic matter must be calculated by using an arbitrary\r\nfactor. Generally the organic matter of the soil is considered to have\r\nfifty-eight per cent carbon; yet different values are given from forty\r\nto seventy-two per cent.\r\n\r\nThere is a general opinion that the black or dark brown material of the\r\nsoil, resulting from the decay of vegetable matter, has a much higher\r\nagricultural value than the undecomposed vegetable matter. No very sharp\r\ndividing line can be drawn, for changes in the soil are continually\r\ngoing on, and material may be found in almost every stage between pure\r\ncellulose and carbon dioxid. The character of the intermediate products\r\nwill vary according to the conditions of tillage and the supply of air\r\nand water.\r\n\r\nFor agricultural purposes some means of determining the amount of\r\ndecomposed matter is very desirable. Several solvents have been tried\r\nfor this purpose. The earlier attempts were made by treating the soil\r\nwith successive quantities of boiling half-saturated solution of sodium\r\ncarbonate until the soil appeared to yield no more coloring matter to\r\nthe solvent. The solutions were then united, rendered acid with HCl,\r\nwhich precipitated the humic acid, which was then washed, dried, and\r\nweighed. This was considered the more soluble portion of the humic acid.\r\nThe soil was afterward treated with caustic potash solution in the same\r\nmanner, and the humus thus extracted was called insoluble humus. This\r\nlast process was really more in the nature of manufacturing humus, for\r\nsawdust treated with caustic potash yields humic acid, and the inert\r\norganic matter in the soil was decomposed to some extent by the caustic\r\nalkali. Neither of the processes provided for the separation of the\r\nhumic acid from the lime, magnesia, alumina, and iron with which it is\r\nusually combined in the soil.\r\n\r\nIn case results of different workers are to be compared, it is of the\r\ngreatest importance that methods should be used that are of such a\r\nnature that errors resulting from difference of manipulation, and from\r\ndifficulty of reproducing duplicate work can be reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nHence, a simple modification of the Grandeau method has been tried which\r\nhas the advantage of keeping a definite amount of the soil in contact\r\nwith a definite volume of ammonia for a fixed time, the strength of the\r\nammonia remaining constant.\r\n\r\nThe process is as follows: The soil is washed with acid and water as\r\nusual. It is then washed into a 500 cubic centimeter cylinder with\r\nammonia, the cylinder closed and well shaken and allowed to remain for a\r\ndefinite time, usually thirty-six hours. The material is shaken at\r\nregular intervals. The cylinder is left inclined as much as possible\r\nwithout having the fluid touch the glass stopper, thus allowing the soil\r\nto settle on the side of the cylinder and exposing a very large surface\r\nto the action of the ammonia. During the last twelve hours the cylinder\r\nis placed in a vertical position to allow the soil to settle well before\r\ntaking out the aliquot part of the solution.\r\n\r\nThe process of washing the soil with hydrochloric acid, water and\r\nammonia, is very tedious when performed in the usual way with the\r\nwash-bottle. A simple automatic washing apparatus was devised by which a\r\nfixed volume of the washing fluid can be delivered at regular intervals,\r\ngiving ample time for the thorough draining between each addition of the\r\nfluid, and requiring no attention. By this apparatus work can be\r\ncontinued day and night. Instead of washing on the usual form of filter\r\npaper in funnels, it is preferable with this apparatus to hold the soils\r\non a disk of filter paper resting on a perforated porcelain disk in the\r\nbottom of the funnel. This removes the necessity of washing out the\r\nfilter papers, does not permit of the accumulation of humus on the edge\r\nof the filter paper when the Grandeau process is used, and insures that\r\nall the washing fluids pass through the soil and not around it. This\r\nform of apparatus reduces the labor to a minimum and permits many\r\ndeterminations to be carried on at once.\r\n\r\nThis form of apparatus was only lately devised and has only been used\r\nlong enough to test it and to show its advantages. The reported results\r\nwere obtained by the ordinary methods of washing.\r\n\r\nIn all the work reported, five grams were used, as the soils contained\r\nso much humus that this amount gave enough humus for good work in the\r\nfinal weighings. The results obtained so far appear in the following\r\ntables:\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE I.\r\n\r\n    COMPARISON OF METHOD OF GRANDEAU WITH HUSTON’S MODIFICATION AND OF\r\n INFLUENCE OF STRENGTH OF AMMONIA SOLUTION.

Summary of Results.=—1. The modified method gives much higher\r\nresults than the original method of Grandeau.\r\n\r\n2. In the Grandeau method marked irregularities follow a change in the\r\nstrength of the ammonia solution. These differences in results bear no\r\nrelation to the strength of the solution used. They seem to be errors\r\ndue to the difficulty of securing uniform and complete washing of the\r\nsoil by the ammonia solution.\r\n\r\nIn the modified method the change in the strength of the ammonia\r\nsolution makes practically no difference in the amount of humus\r\nextracted, except in the case of the peat soil where two per cent\r\nammonia failed to extract all the humus. But the results show no\r\nconsiderable increase when the strength is increased to over four per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n3. The factor of time has not been fully investigated, but the results\r\nso far obtained indicate that the time exerts less influence in the\r\nmodified than in the Grandeau method.\r\n\r\n4. Table III shows that considerable quantities of the peat soil are\r\nstill passing into solution in the Grandeau method at the end of ten\r\ndays. With ordinary soils this is not true; but in the case of soil No.\r\n5, a black soil, the solutions were colored at the end of a week. On the\r\npeat soil the modified method extracted from ten to fifty per cent more\r\nthan the Grandeau, and on the ordinary soil from two to three times as\r\nmuch humus.\r\n\r\n5. In comparing duplicate results by both methods it is found that with\r\nsoil No. 3, peat soil, the following differences appear calculated to\r\npercentage of the total amount involved in the determination:\r\n\r\n                          Per cent.

In the\r\nset of six special determinations made by both methods to test this\r\npoint and which are strictly comparable with each other, the maximum\r\nrange was by the modified method 7.8 per cent and by the Grandeau 8.3\r\nper cent of the total amount involved in the determination. From which\r\nit appears that the modified method is on the whole capable of yielding\r\nrather more concordant results than the Grandeau.\r\n\r\n=314. Estimation of Free Humic Acids.=—This process, due to Müntz[201]\r\nis essentially that of Huston and McBride. Twenty grams of the soil are\r\nreduced to a fine powder and saturated with fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nconcentrated ammonia and allowed to digest two or three days in a warm\r\nplace. The volume is then made up to one liter with water, well shaken,\r\nand set aside for one day in order to permit the subsidence of the solid\r\nmatter. At the end of this time 500 cubic centimeters of the supernatant\r\nliquor are taken and acidified with hydrochloric acid in order to\r\nprecipitate the humic bodies. The humus is collected on a filter, dried\r\nand weighed. It is then ignited and the weight of ash deducted from the\r\nfirst weight thus giving the actual weight of the humus obtained, free\r\nfrom mineral matter. This process gives the free humic acids. By\r\nprevious treatment of the sample with hydrochloric acid as in the\r\nprocess of Huston and McBride, the total humus is obtained. The\r\nestimation of the free humic acids is of importance in determining the\r\nquantity of lime or marl which should be added to acid lands.\r\n\r\n=315. Humus Method of Von Bemmelén.=[202]—Von Bemmelén obtains the\r\ncontent of humus by the multiplication of the content of carbon in the\r\nsoil by the factor of Wolff; _viz._, 1.724. The estimation of carbon,\r\nwater, and of the loss on ignition is conducted in combustion tubes in a\r\ncurrent of oxygen. The nitrogen estimation is carried on according to\r\nthe method of Dumas.\r\n\r\nIn soils containing calcium carbonate the carbon content is derived from\r\nthe carbon dioxid taken up by the potash bulbs during combustion (a);\r\nfrom other carbonates not decomposed on ignition and which are\r\nsubsequently determined in the residue by treatment with hydrochloric\r\nacid in a carbon dioxid apparatus, (b) and the total carbon dioxid\r\nderived from the carbonates in the soil (c).\r\n\r\nFor each estimation from three to five grams of the soil are taken,\r\nbecause with smaller quantities the errors of analysis too strongly\r\ninfluence the results. The carbon is then calculated according to the\r\nformula:\r\n\r\n                       Carbon = ³⁄₁₁ (a + b − c).\r\n\r\n_The Carbon Dioxid of Carbonates._—It is necessary to expel the carbon\r\ndioxid at ordinary temperatures, because on heating to boiling, carbon\r\ndioxid would be formed from the humus. In a flask, as small as possible,\r\nthe soil is treated at ordinary temperature, with dilute sulfuric or\r\ncitric acid, the escaping gas dried over sulfuric acid and taken up with\r\nsoda-lime. Behind the soda-lime is a small tube filled with pieces of\r\nglass and moistened with sulfuric acid, which retains any moisture taken\r\nout of the soda-lime. A stream of about one liter of air, free from\r\ncarbon dioxid, is sufficient to drive out all of the carbon dioxid when\r\nthe estimation is made at ordinary temperatures.\r\n\r\nA volcanic earth from Deli, which contained five per cent of humus,\r\ngave, at a temperature plus or minus 15°, 0.01 per cent CO₂. At boiling\r\ntemperature two analyses gave 0.54 and 0.56 CO₂. This soil contained no\r\ncarbonate, and the carbon dioxid found at the boiling temperature, must\r\nhave come from the humus substances under the influence of the dilute\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nA heavy clay containing 6.9 per cent of humus gave, at plus or minus\r\n15°, 3.60 per cent CO₂; at 100° without boiling, it gave an additional\r\n0.53 per cent, and with boiling an additional 0.11 per cent, or a total\r\nof 4.24 per cent CO₂. A light clay containing 3.2 per cent of humus,\r\ngave, at 15°, 5.09 per cent CO₂; at a boiling temperature an additional\r\n0.43 per cent, and by continued boiling an additional 0.27 per cent.\r\n\r\n=316. Estimation of Humus by the German Method.=—The German experiment\r\nstations follow the method of Loges,[203] depending on the oxidation of\r\nthe humic bodies with copper oxid after evaporation of the sample with\r\nphosphoric acid. The object of the preliminary evaporation is to set the\r\nhumic acids free in order that they may be better and more easily\r\noxidized than when burned in the combined state.\r\n\r\nThe sample of soil is placed in a Hoffmeister dish (Schälchen),\r\nmoistened with dilute phosphoric acid and evaporated to complete\r\ndryness. The dish and its contents are rubbed up with pulverized copper\r\noxid and placed in a combustion tube of sixty centimeters in length,\r\nopen at both ends. There is then placed in the tube, and held in place\r\nby asbestos plugs, granular copper oxid to a length of twenty\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nThe combustion tube is placed in a proper furnace and one end connected\r\nwith two washing-flasks, the first containing potash lye, and the other\r\na solution of barium hydroxid. These flasks are to free the aspirated\r\nair from carbon dioxid. The other end of the combustion tube is\r\nconnected with an appropriate apparatus for absorbing the carbon dioxid.\r\nLoges recommends the Pettenkofer absorption tube and a Fresenius drying\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nBetween the absorption apparatus and the aspirator, is also placed a\r\nwashing-flask containing barium hydroxid solution, serving to detect any\r\nunabsorbed carbon dioxid. The layer of granular copper oxid is first\r\nheated, the air being slowly aspirated through the apparatus meanwhile,\r\nbut not through the absorption bulbs. All the carbon dioxid is thus\r\nremoved from the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe absorption system being connected, the tube is heated slowly from\r\nthe front, backwards, and after the tube is well heated a slow current\r\nof air is drawn through and continued until the combustion is complete,\r\nwhich is usually in about three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nAfter the tube is cool the powdered copper oxid and residue of\r\ncombustion are removed, and for this reason the tube is stopped with a\r\ncork at both ends instead of being drawn out and sealed at one end. The\r\ntube can thus be refilled without disturbing the granular layer of\r\ncopper oxid.\r\n\r\nThe drying cylinder used between the combustion tube and the absorption\r\nsystem has its upper part filled with cotton to avoid the deleterious\r\neffects of the nitric oxid produced in the combustion. With this\r\narrangement the use of metallic copper in the combustion tube to reduce\r\nthe nitric oxid can be dispensed with, the moist cotton holding back the\r\nacid fumes. The per cent of humus is obtained by multiplying the per\r\ncent of carbon found by 1.724.\r\n\r\n=317. Method of Raulin for the Estimation of Humus.=[204]—The volumetric\r\nestimation of humus in soil by a solution of potassium permanganate\r\nwould be convenient and practical if the combustion of the organic\r\nmatter were complete, and if the browning of the liquor did not render\r\nthe end of the reaction uncertain. The process of Schmidt, modified as\r\nbelow, has given satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nIn a small flask, with flat bottom, containing about 250 cubic\r\ncentimeters, are introduced ten cubic centimeters of a solution of\r\nmanganese sulfate containing sixteen grams of the anhydrous salt per\r\nliter, and ten cubic centimeters of a ten per cent solution of potassium\r\npermanganate. The solution is heated for a few minutes, the liquor is\r\ndecolorized and manganese bronze is precipitated. One hundred cubic\r\ncentimeters of water are added, and four cubic centimeters of sulfuric\r\nacid containing 150 cubic centimeters of monohydrated acid per liter.\r\nThere is now added an exactly measured volume of the humic liquid\r\nproperly prepared, so that in oxidizing completely it destroys at most\r\nonly half of the manganese dioxid. The mixture is submitted to gentle\r\nebullition for eight hours, the water being kept at a constant volume.\r\nThe excess of manganese dioxid remaining is dissolved hot by a measured\r\nportion of decinormal oxalic acid in slight excess, and the excess of\r\noxalic acid is removed by a solution of potassium permanganate\r\ncontaining one gram per liter. The volume of oxalic acid not destroyed\r\nby manganese dioxid is calculated from the amount of permanganate\r\nconsumed. The volume of oxalic acid, which corresponds to the same\r\nquantity of dioxid as the introduced humus, is also calculated by taking\r\nthe difference between the volume of oxalic acid necessary to destroy\r\nall the dioxid formed by ten cubic centimeters of the ten per cent\r\npermanganate solution, and the volume of the oxalic acid which has\r\ndestroyed the dioxid remaining after the action of the humus. The first\r\nvolume of oxalic acid, that is to say, that which destroys the dioxid\r\nformed by ten cubic centimeters of ten per cent permanganate is\r\ndetermined in a preliminary titration.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the humic liquor, it is prepared by treating ten grams of\r\nearth with soda solution in the usual manner. It will be easy to\r\ncalculate the volume of the oxalic solution equivalent to the total\r\nvolume of the humic solution, of which a determined fraction has been\r\nassayed, and consequently the volume of oxalic solution equivalent to\r\nthe humus in ten grams of the dry earth. This number of cubic\r\ncentimeters of the decinormal oxalic solution multiplied by 0.8 will\r\nexpress in milligrams the weight of oxygen necessary to burn the humus\r\nfrom ten grams of dry earth. Humus not being a definite compound, but a\r\nresidue of complex organic matters partially oxidized, it will require\r\nas much more oxygen to complete the combustion as the previous oxidation\r\nhas been less pronounced. This weight of oxygen necessary to burn the\r\nhumus from ten grams of dry earth may serve to detect the total value as\r\nwell as the weight of the humus itself. However, if we wish to have\r\ndirectly the weight of the humus, resource can be had to a table which,\r\nwithout being rigorous, can be regarded as sufficiently exact when the\r\nvariability of the constitution of humus is taken into account.\r\n\r\n  Volume of decinormal oxalic acid      Corresponding humus, directly\r\n       for ten grams of earth.                   determined.\r\n         Cubic centimeters.

Pasturel’s Method.=—According to Pasturel[205] the process of\r\nRaulin does not furnish figures that are rigorously exact only with soil\r\nof which the humus contains forty-five per cent of carbon. When the\r\nrichness in organic carbon is less, the results of the estimation are\r\ntoo high. Pasturel modifies the process as follows:\r\n\r\n_Manganese Sulfate._—Dissolve sixteen grams of the pure anhydrous\r\nmanganese sulfate in distilled water and make the solution up to one\r\nliter.\r\n\r\n_Potassium Permanganate._—Make a solution of ten grams of potassium\r\npermanganate in one liter of water; 100 cubic centimeters of the liquor\r\njust mentioned are diluted to one liter and constitute the potassium\r\npermanganate solution one to ten.\r\n\r\n_Oxalic and Sulfuric Acids._—A solution of oxalic acid is prepared\r\ncontaining 6.3 grams of the acid in one liter of water, and a dilute\r\nsolution of sulfuric acid, by dissolving 150 grams of the monohydrated\r\nacid in one liter of water.\r\n\r\n_Humus Solution._—The solution of humus is prepared by the following\r\nprocess: Ten grams of fine earth are freed from all their carbonates by\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid. After washing, the filter is broken and the\r\ndirt is washed into a small flask. Not more than twenty or thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of water should be employed for this purpose. Twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of a liquor containing two grams of caustic soda are added,\r\nand the flask is placed upon a sand-bath and maintained at a boiling\r\ntemperature for six hours. It is then diluted with water, filtered and\r\nwashed as long as the waters are colored. The liquor is treated with\r\ndilute sulfuric acid until almost the whole of the soda is saturated. It\r\nis indispensable, however, to maintain a slight alkalinity in order that\r\nthe organic matter may rest totally dissolved. The precipitation of\r\nsilica which is almost always produced is without inconvenience.\r\nAfterward the volume is completed to 500 cubic centimeters and the humus\r\nsolution is then ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Humus._—Ten cubic centimeters of the manganese\r\nsulfate are placed in a flask and ten cubic centimeters of the\r\npermanganate added, and the whole is then slightly heated, and afterward\r\n100 cubic centimeters of water and four cubic centimeters of sulfuric\r\nacid are added. The humic liquor is now introduced in such proportion\r\nthat the humus which it contains dissolves at the greatest, a half of\r\nthe precipitated manganese and the rest of the process is continued as\r\ndescribed by Raulin.\r\n\r\n=319. Estimation of Carbonates in Arable Soil.=—The principle of the\r\ndetermination depends on the liberation of the carbon dioxid from its\r\ncompounds in the soil by acting on them with strong acid, and the\r\ndesiccation, absorption, and weighing of the evolved gas. Any of the\r\nordinary forms of apparatus for estimating carbon dioxid may be used in\r\nthis determination.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of Knorr[206] has been used with satisfaction for many\r\nyears in the laboratory of the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 65.\r\n\r\n  KNORR’S APPARATUS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF CARBON DIOXID.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a flask A, Fig. 65, in which the carbon dioxid\r\nin the soil is liberated. A condenser, D, fits by means of a\r\nground-glass joint into the neck of the flask in which the liberated\r\ngas, together with any air or aqueous vapor which may be carried\r\nforward, is cooled. This prevents any excess of vapor of water from\r\nentering the absorbing bulbs, which could easily happen at the end of\r\nthe experiments when the contents of A are raised to the boiling point.\r\nThe bulb B contains the acid, usually hydrochloric, which is employed\r\nfor decomposing the carbonates. It is provided with a guard bulb-tube,\r\nC, which serves to absorb any carbon dioxid which might enter the\r\napparatus with the air during aspiration at the close of the\r\ndetermination. The carbon dioxid is dried in the bulb-tube, E, in oil of\r\nvitriol, and absorbed in the potash solution in F. It is advisable to\r\naspirate a slow current of air through the apparatus by means of the\r\ntube G during the whole of the operation. The quantity of the sample to\r\nbe taken depends on its richness in carbonates. Many soils are so poor\r\nin carbonates as to render any attempt at exact determination nugatory.\r\nOn the other hand, a comparatively small sample of marls will be\r\nsufficient. A preliminary qualitative test will indicate, in a general\r\nway, the quantity of the sample to be taken. The sample of soil, five to\r\nfifty grams, having been transferred to A, which should be perfectly\r\ndry, is made into a batter with freshly boiled distilled water. When all\r\nthe parts of the apparatus are properly connected gas-tight, the cock\r\nbetween B and A is slowly opened and the hydrochloric (nitric) acid in B\r\nallowed to flow into A at such a rate as will secure a moderate\r\nevolution of gas.\r\n\r\nWhen the carbonate is entirely decomposed, a lamp is brought under A and\r\nits contents gradually raised to the boiling point. The aspiration of\r\nair, free from carbon dioxid, is meanwhile continued until all the\r\nliberated gas has been absorbed in F. Usually about fifteen minutes will\r\nbe sufficient to accomplish this purpose.\r\n\r\n=320. Bernard’s Calcimeter.=—For a rapid and approximately accurate\r\nmethod of determining the amount of carbonate in the soil, estimated as\r\ncalcium carbonate, Bernard makes use of the well-known method of the\r\nvolumetric estimation of carbon dioxid. The sample to be examined should\r\nnot be powdered in any way. The sample in a natural state, but well\r\nair-dried, is gently broken up by the fingers and passed through a sieve\r\nhaving ten meshes to the centimeter. Of the fine earth thus obtained,\r\none gram is taken, for the determination. If the percentage of carbonate\r\nin the soil exceeds fifty then only half a gram is taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 66.\r\n\r\n  BERNARD’S CALCIMETER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus employed is one well known. The small erlenmeyer C is\r\nfitted with a rubber stopper carrying an exit tube for the gas and a\r\nsmall thermometer. This flask is connected by means of a rubber tube and\r\nsmall glass tube to the measuring burette B. This burette is graduated\r\nfrom 0 to 100 cubic centimeters. Below, by means of a rubber tube, it is\r\nconnected with the open bulb A, which, by means of a cord about its\r\nneck, can be suspended by the hook as shown in the figure. The measuring\r\ntube is filled with water through A until the level of the liquid in B\r\nis slightly above the zero mark. Meanwhile the one gram of earth has\r\nbeen placed in C, together with the tube D three-fourths filled with an\r\nequal mixture of water and strong hydrochloric acid. The greatest care\r\nmust be taken that no part of the acid be spilled.\r\n\r\nThe rubber stopper is now forced into C until the level of the water in\r\nB is just at the zero mark. Grasping C in the right hand and A in the\r\nleft, the operator inclines C until the contents of D are emptied.\r\nMeanwhile as the gas is evolved, A is lowered at such a rate as to\r\nalways keep the level of the water in B and A on the same plane. In a\r\nfew moments the evolution of gas is complete, and the volume given off\r\nis read at once without correction. This volume multiplied by 0.4 gives\r\nthe percentage of carbonate in the sample examined. It is understood\r\nthat the determination is made at ordinary temperatures; _viz._, 17° to\r\n22°. Example:\r\n\r\n\r\n  One gram of a soil treated as above, gave of carbon dioxid\r\n  (uncorrected) 65 cubic centimeters. 65 × 0.4 = 26.00 = per cent\r\n  calcium carbonate in sample.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above method is useful in the classification of soils and in\r\ndetermining approximately the quantity of calcium carbonate which they\r\ncontain. The practical use of this method is of great value in\r\ndetermining the character of fertilizer to be applied. It is well to\r\nknow the percentage of carbonate in selecting mineral fertilizers.\r\n\r\n=321. Soils Deficient in Carbonates.=—When a soil contains but a small\r\nquantity of carbonates, Müller[207] has called attention to the fact\r\nthat the carbon dioxid absorbed by the water in which the soil is rubbed\r\nup may vitiate the result. Instead of water a titrated solution of\r\nsodium carbonate is employed. The apparatus is composed of a flask\r\ncontaining the mixture of the sodium carbonate and the soil on which the\r\nhydrochloric acid is to act. The hydrochloric acid is contained in a\r\nsmall tube, as in Scheibler’s apparatus. The gas is received in a rubber\r\ntube 1.5 meters long and three to four millimeters interior diameter,\r\nand connected with a burette, the open mouth of which dips into the\r\nwater of a cylinder of proper length. The volume of gas is read when the\r\nburette is raised or lowered in the cylinder until the liquid within and\r\nwithout stands at the same level.\r\n\r\nDuring the action of the acid on the carbonates the flask is constantly\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\nSeveral readings of the volume of gas are made, the evolution flask\r\nbeing vigorously shaken before each one. Finally, in order to allow for\r\nthe variations in temperature and pressure of the exterior air which may\r\ntake place between the beginning and the end of the reaction, a second\r\nflask containing air is placed by the side of the evolution flask and\r\ncommunicating with a narrow =ᥩ= tube half filled with water. Any\r\nvariations in the volume of the air in the flask will be shown by\r\nvariations in the height of the liquid in the two arms of the =ᥩ= tube,\r\nand the volume of the variation can be easily determined by having the\r\n=ᥩ= tube calibrated.\r\n\r\nIf now _a_ equals the volume per cent of carbon dioxid in the atmosphere\r\nof the evolution flask at the end of the reaction, _v_ the volume of gas\r\ndisengaged, and V the volume of the atmosphere in the evolution flask,\r\nthe per cent of carbon dioxid contained in a given length of the rubber\r\ntube will be equal to _a_/2. This arises from the fact that the first\r\ngas which passes into the rubber tube is composed solely of air, while\r\nthe last contains a per cent of carbon dioxid. By reason of the shaking\r\nof the flask the mean richness of the contents of the tube in carbon\r\ndioxid, will be sensibly _a_/2.\r\n\r\nFrom the above data the following equations are derived:\r\n\r\n1. _v__a_/2 + V_a_ = _v_.\r\n\r\n2. _a_ = _v_/(_v_/2 + V)\r\n\r\nIf the weight of the carbon dioxid dissolved in V′ cubic centimeters of\r\nthe liquid in the evolution flask be represented by _q_, the coefficient\r\nof the solubility of pure carbon dioxid in this liquid will be,\r\naccording to the law of the solubility of a gas, equal to _k_ =\r\n(_q_)/(V′_a_)\r\n\r\nThe volume of _k_ has been determined for various strengths of the\r\nsodium carbonate solution, using five cubic centimeters of hydrochloric\r\nacid containing 1.6 grams pure hydrochloric acid. For solutions\r\ndisengaging from five to fifty milligrams of carbon dioxid, the mean\r\nvalue of _k_ was found to be 1.8 milligrams in the absence of calcium\r\nchlorid. When calcium chlorid was present in quantities varying from\r\n0.03 to 0.07 gram per cubic centimeter of liquid in the evolution flask,\r\nthe value of _k_ was 1.4 milligrams.\r\n\r\nBy adopting, according to circumstances, the one or the other of the\r\nabove numbers and multiplying it by V_a_, as determined by experiment,\r\nresults are obtained differing only 0.2 to 0.3 milligram from those\r\nsecured by direct weighing of the evolved gas.\r\n\r\nDietrich[208] has called attention to the necessity of adding the volume\r\nof the dissolved gas to the measured volume in such determinations, and\r\nthis volume or weight is easily determined by the above formulas.\r\n\r\n=322. Belgian Method.=—The method pursued at the Gembloux Station[209]\r\nconsists in taking from five to fifty grams of the sample of soil,\r\naccording to its content in carbonate, rubbing it up in a porcelain dish\r\nwith distilled water in order to make a thin paste. The mass is worked\r\nto drive out all the air, the whole washed into a flask of 300 cubic\r\ncentimeters capacity, and the amount of carbon dioxid estimated by\r\nsetting free with an acid, and collecting the carbon dioxid evolved in\r\npotash bulbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DIGESTION OF SOILS WITH SOLVENTS.\r\n\r\n=323. General Considerations.=—There are two points in connection with\r\nthe determination of mineral matters in the soil which must always be\r\nkept in view; _viz._, first, the estimation of the total quantities of\r\nmaterial in the soil, and second, the study of those materials which are\r\nmore easily brought into solution and thus made available for the food\r\nof plants.\r\n\r\nIt is well understood that the soil particles do not give up entirely to\r\nthe plant the food materials which they contain. The practical value\r\ntherefore of an analysis of a soil depends more upon the exact\r\ndetermination of the plant food available than upon its total quantity.\r\nFrom a mineral and geological point of view, on the other hand, an idea\r\nof the total composition of the soil is the object to be attained.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of the available plant food, various solvents have\r\nbeen proposed, none of which, perhaps, imitates very accurately the\r\nnatural solvent action of organic life and moisture on the soil\r\nmaterials. A description of the standard methods of preparing soil\r\nextracts will be the subject of a few succeeding paragraphs.\r\n\r\n=324. Estimation of the Quantity of Materials Soluble in\r\nWater.=[210]—Five hundred grams of the air-dried soil are treated in a\r\nflask with 1,500 cubic centimeters of water, less the quantity of water\r\nalready contained in the air-dried soil, which is volatile at 125°. The\r\nmass is frequently shaken and, after seventy-two hours, 750 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the liquid filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to\r\ndryness in a platinum dish, dried at 120° and weighed. This is then\r\nincinerated and, after treatment with ammonium carbonate and gentle\r\nignition, is again weighed. The further examination of the residue for\r\nacids and bases is made by some of the methods hereafter described.\r\n\r\n=325. Treatment with Water Saturated with Carbon Dioxid.=—Two thousand\r\nfive hundred grams of the air-dried soil are treated with 8000 cubic\r\ncentimeters of distilled, and afterwards with 2000 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater, which have previously, at room temperature, been saturated with\r\ncarbon dioxid. The mixture is left in a closed flask for seven days,\r\nfrequently shaken, after which 7,500 cubic centimeters of the liquid are\r\nfiltered. The clear filtrate, after treatment with a little hydrochloric\r\nacid and a few drops of nitric acid, is evaporated to dryness. After the\r\nseparation of the silica the traces of iron, alumina, lime, sulfuric\r\nacid, magnesia, potash, and soda, are estimated in the liquid in the\r\nmanner hereinafter to be described. Phosphoric acid is always present in\r\nsuch a case, in such small quantities as to make its estimation\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n=326. Treatment with Water Containing Ammonium Chlorid.=—In the flask\r\ncontaining the residue from the last experiment; _viz._, the soil with\r\n2,500 cubic centimeters of liquid, are added 1,500 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater saturated with carbon dioxid, and 8,000 cubic centimeters of pure\r\nwater in which five grams of ammonium chlorid are dissolved. The mixture\r\nis then left for seven days, with frequent shaking, and 7,500 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the liquid are then filtered, and the substances\r\ndissolved, determined in the filtrate. In addition to the usual\r\nquantities of lime and magnesia, from two to four times as much alkali\r\nis dissolved by this treatment as is found in the solution from the\r\nwater containing carbon dioxid alone.\r\n\r\n=327. Treatment with Water Containing Acetic Acid.=—The acetic acid\r\nshould be of such a strength that after it has fully acted on the soil\r\nit should still contain twenty per cent of free acid. 1000 grams of the\r\nsoil dried at 100° are taken and the acid added in proper proportions\r\nand treated in the manner to be described for determining the solvent\r\naction of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n=328. Treatment with Citric Acid Solution.=—In ascertaining the\r\nquantities of soil materials soluble in a solution of citric acid,\r\nDyer[211] recommends the use of a carefully prepared citric acid\r\nsolution. The digestion is carried on as follows: Place in a flask or\r\nbottle, holding about three liters, 200 grams of air-dried soil and two\r\nliters of distilled water, in which are dissolved twenty grams of pure\r\ncitric acid. The soil is left, at room temperature, in contact with the\r\none per cent acid for seven days, with thorough shaking several times a\r\nday. At the end of the digestion the solution is filtered and 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate, corresponding to fifty grams of the soil,\r\nare taken for analysis for each ingredient to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe digestion in citric acid is especially recommended by Dyer because\r\nof its supposed near resemblance to the methods of solution of plant\r\nfood practiced by the rootlets of plants. It is evident, however, that\r\nthis process is in no sense an imitation of natural methods. The\r\nsolution is to be used exclusively for the estimation of potash and\r\nphosphoric acid. Dyer concludes, from a comparison of the action of a\r\nsolution of citric acid on soils of known fertility, that when as little\r\nas 0.01 per cent of phosphoric acid is dissolved from a soil by this\r\ntreatment it is justifiable to assume that it stands in immediate need\r\nof phosphatic manure. The methods used by Dyer to determine the\r\nphosphoric acid and potash in the citric acid solution will be given in\r\ntheir appropriate place.\r\n\r\n=329. Treatment with Hydrochloric Acid.=—The solutions of soils usually\r\nsubjected to chemical analysis are those obtained by long treatment with\r\nhot mineral acids, among which the most common is hydrochloric.\r\n\r\nIt has long been assumed by soil analysts, perhaps not with justness,\r\nthat such treatment removed from the soil, all those elements of plant\r\nfood which could possibly be available for the needs of the growing\r\ncrop. In this connection, however, the analyst must not forget that\r\nnature, in a series of years, with her own methods may easily accomplish\r\nwhat he in five days, even with the help of a hot mineral acid, may not\r\nbe able to secure. Since, however, this method of solution has been so\r\nlong practiced it is not the place here to throw doubt on its\r\neffectiveness without being able to suggest a better way. Of the mineral\r\nacids available no one possesses solvent powers for soils in a higher\r\ndegree than hydrochloric. A somewhat detailed description will therefore\r\nbe given of the methods of its use.\r\n\r\n=330. Strength of Acid to be Employed.=—The fact that hydrochloric acid\r\nof nearly constant strength; _viz._, specific gravity 1.115, equivalent\r\nto 22.9 per cent hydrochloric acid, may be obtained by distillation, led\r\nOwen to use acid of this density in his classic work on soil analysis.\r\nHilgard has lately reviewed the conditions of constant strength in the\r\nsolvent with results confirming the statements of Owen.[212] He\r\nevaporated on a steam-bath, to one-half its bulk, fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of hydrochloric acid, specific gravity 1.116, obtained by\r\nusing the distillate from a stronger acid after rejecting the first\r\nthird. The same operation was conducted with similar acid diluted with\r\nten per cent of water. The acid used contained 22.96 per cent\r\nhydrochloric acid. The residual acid contained 21.49 per cent\r\nhydrochloric acid. These results lead Hilgard to believe that the\r\nchanges arising from evaporation in hydrochloric acid during soil\r\ndigestion are insignificant, compared with those due to its action on\r\nthe soluble matters, and that evaporation during digestion is effective\r\nin maintaining a definite strength in the solvent. For this reason it is\r\ncontended that evaporation in a porcelain beaker covered by a\r\nwatch-glass is more effective in constancy of conditions than digestion\r\nin a closed flask under pressure.\r\n\r\n=331. Influence of Time of Digestion and Strength of Acid.=—Loughridge\r\nhas made an interesting study of the influence of the strength of acid\r\nand time of digestion on the extraction of soils.[213] The method of\r\npreparing the soil for the determination of the above points is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe soil, having been passed through the appropriate number of sieves to\r\nobtain the fine earth is pulverized with a wooden pestle and thoroughly\r\nmixed. The hygroscopic moisture is determined, after exposing it in a\r\nplace saturated with vapor, in a layer not exceeding one millimeter in\r\nthickness for twelve hours, and subsequently drying at 200° in a\r\nparaffin-bath. Of this dried substance, from two to three grams are used\r\nin the general analysis, the methods employed being in general those\r\nadopted by Peter.[214]\r\n\r\nThe quantities of materials dissolved by acids of different densities\r\nare shown below. The determinations were made by methods hereafter to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n                                      Specific gravity of\r\n                                             acid.\r\n                   Ingredients.        1.00  1.115  1.160\r\n             Insoluble residue         71.88  70.53  74.15\r\n             Soluble silica            11.38  12.30   9.42\r\n             Potash                     0.60   0.63   0.48\r\n             Soda                       0.13   0.09   0.35\r\n             Lime                       0.27   0.27   0.23\r\n             Magnesia                   0.45   0.45   0.45\r\n             Manganese oxid             0.06   0.06   0.06\r\n             Ferric oxid                5.15   5.11   5.04\r\n             Alumina                    6.84   8.09   6.22\r\n             Sulfuric acid              0.02   0.02   0.02\r\n             Volatile matter            3.14   3.14   3.14\r\n                                      —————— ——————  —————\r\n                      Total           100.02 100.69  99.29\r\n\r\n             Amount of soluble matter  24.00  27.02  22.27\r\n             „   „     „    bases      13.50  14.70  12.83\r\n\r\nFrom the above table it is seen that the strongest acid exerts the least\r\nsoluble effect upon the substances present in the soil, while the\r\ngreatest degree of solution was obtained by the acid of 1.115 specific\r\ngravity. This result indicates that while lime and magnesia are probably\r\npresent chiefly as carbonates, potash as well as alumina, and to some\r\nextent lime, are present as silicates, and for that reason are not as\r\nfully extracted by acid of low strength as by that of medium\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the influence of the time of digestion, the acid of\r\nspecific gravity 1.115 being used, the data obtained are given in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n                                    Number of days digested.\r\n            Ingredients.         1.     3.     4.     5.    10.\r\n\r\n      Insoluble residue         76.97  72.66  71.86  70.53  71.79\r\n      Soluble silica             8.60  11.18  11.64  12.30  10.96\r\n      Potash                     0.35   0.44   0.57   0.63   0.62\r\n      Soda                       0.06   0.06   0.03   0.09   0.28\r\n      Lime                       0.26   0.29   0.28   0.27   0.27\r\n      Magnesia                   0.42   0.44   0.47   0.45   0.44\r\n      Manganese oxid             0.04    .06   0.06   0.06   0.06\r\n      Ferric oxid                4.77   5.01   5.43   5.11   4.85\r\n      Alumina                    5.15   7.38   7.07   7.88   7.16\r\n      Phosphoric acid                                 0.21   0.21\r\n      Sulfuric acid              0.02   0.02   0.02   0.02   0.02\r\n      Volatile matter            3.14   3.14   3.14   3.14   3.14\r\n                                ————— —————— —————— ——————  —————\r\n               Total            99.63 100.68 100.55 100.69  99.80\r\n\r\n      Amount of soluble matter  19.67  24.88  25.57  27.02  24.87\r\n      „    „     „    bases     11.05  13.68  13.91  14.49  13.68\r\n\r\nFrom this table it appears that the amount of dissolved ingredients\r\nincreases up to the fifth day, the increase becoming, however, very slow\r\nas that limit is approached. It is also found that the ingredients\r\noffering the greatest resistance to this action are the same as those\r\nwhose amounts were sensibly affected by the strength of the acid;\r\nnamely, silica, potash, and alumina.\r\n\r\nIn regard to lime and magnesia, one day’s digestion not being sufficient\r\nfor full extraction, it is evident that they do not exist in the soil as\r\ncarbonates or hydric oxids only, as has been supposed, but also as\r\nsilicates. A comparison of the results of the five and ten days’\r\ndigestion shows that the solvent action of the acid has substantially\r\nceased at the end of five days, there being no further increase of the\r\namount of dissolved matter.\r\n\r\n=332. Digestion Vessels.=—Hilgard prescribes that the digestion of the\r\nsample of soil with acid be conducted in a small porcelain beaker\r\ncovered with a watch-glass.[215] Kedzie, however, prefers beakers of\r\nbohemian glass, and shows that hydrochloric acid attacks the porcelain\r\nwith greater energy than the glass.[216] Platinum would be the ideal\r\nmaterial for the digestive vessels, but its great cost would exclude its\r\ngeneral use. In most cases it will be found that the error introduced\r\ninto the analysis by the use of porcelain or bohemian glass beakers is\r\nquite small and not likely to affect the quantitative estimation of\r\nsoluble soil ingredients to any extent.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory some comparative tests made by Mr. W. D. Bigelow have\r\nshown that vessels of hard glass of special manufacture are less soluble\r\nin hot hydrochloric acid of 1.115 specific gravity than porcelain, thus\r\nconfirming the observation of Kedzie. Following are the data showing the\r\nweights of material dissolved in fifty hours:\r\n\r\n                Berlin porcelain          2.8 milligrams\r\n                Bohemian glass            1.7     „\r\n                Kaehler and Martini glass 1.2     „\r\n\r\nIn each case twenty-five cubic centimeters of the acid were used. The\r\nvessels all had approximately a capacity of 200 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n=333. Processes Employed—Hilgard’s Method.=—The sample of soil sifted\r\nthrough a 0.5 millimeter mesh sieve and thoroughly air-dried, is\r\nconveniently preserved in weighing tubes. The actual content of\r\nhygroscopic and combined moisture may be previously made on a separate\r\nsample of soil.\r\n\r\nIn determining the amount of material to be employed for the general\r\nanalysis regard must be had to the nature of the soil. This is necessary\r\nbecause of the impracticability of handling successfully such large\r\nprecipitates of alumina as would result from the employment of as much\r\nas five grams in the case of calcareous clay soils; while in the case of\r\nvery sandy soils even that quantity might require to be doubled in order\r\nto obtain weighable amounts of certain ingredients. For soils in which\r\nthe insoluble portion ranges from sixty to eighty per cent, two and a\r\nhalf to three grams are about the right measure for general analysis,\r\nwhile for the phosphoric acid determination not less than three grams\r\nshould be employed in any case. It has been alleged that larger\r\nquantities must be taken for analysis in order to secure average\r\nresults. It is difficult to see why this should be true for soils and\r\nnot for ores, in which the results affect directly the money value,\r\nwhile in the case of soils the interpretation of results allows much\r\nwider limits in the percentages. Correct sampling must be presupposed to\r\nmake any analysis useful; but with modern balances and methods it is\r\ndifficult to see why five grams should be employed instead of half that\r\namount, which in some cases is still too much for convenient\r\nmanipulation of certain precipitates.\r\n\r\nThe weighed quantity, usually of two to two and a half grams, is brought\r\ninto a small porcelain beaker, covered with a watch-glass, treated with\r\neight to ten times its bulk of hydrochloric acid of 1.115 specific\r\ngravity, and two or three drops of nitric acid, and digested for five\r\ndays over the laboratory steam-bath. At the end of this time it is\r\nevaporated to dryness, first on the water-bath and then on the\r\nsand-bath. By this treatment all the silica set free is rendered\r\ninsoluble.\r\n\r\n=334. Provisional Method of the Official Agricultural Chemists.=—Place\r\nten grams of the air-dried soil in a round bottom 150 to 200 cubic\r\ncentimeter bohemian flask, add 100 cubic centimeters of pure\r\nhydrochloric acid of specific gravity 1.115, insert the stopper, wire it\r\nsecurely, place in a steam-bath, and digest for thirty-six hours at the\r\ntemperature of boiling water. Pour the contents of the flask into a\r\nsmall beaker, wash with distilled water, add the washings to the\r\ncontents of the beaker and filter through a washed filter. The residue\r\nis the amount insoluble in hydrochloric acid. Add a few drops of nitric\r\nacid to the filtrate, and evaporate to dryness on the water-bath; take\r\nup with hot water and a few drops of hydrochloric acid, and again\r\nevaporate to complete dryness. Take up as before, and filter into a\r\nliter-flask, washing with hot water. Cool and make up to the mark. This\r\nis solution A. The residue represents the silica originally dissolved.\r\nIn comparing the two preceding methods it is found that the former;\r\n_viz._, digestion in flasks covered only with a watch-glass gives a\r\nlarger quantity of dissolved matter in five days than the digestion\r\nunder pressure does in thirty-six hours. In comparative tests in this\r\nlaboratory made by Mr. W. D. Bigelow the respective quantities of\r\nsoluble and insoluble matter obtained by the two methods in two soils\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n                              Soil No. 1.

The German Station Method.=—The method recommended by the German\r\nStations[217] is greatly different from that described above, both in\r\ntemperature and time of digestion. To one part of the soil are added two\r\nparts by volume of a twenty-five per cent hydrochloric acid solution,\r\nthe quantity being increased to correspond to any excess of carbonates.\r\nThe mixture is left for forty-eight hours with frequent shaking. As an\r\nalternate method, one part of soil is treated with two parts by volume\r\nof ten per cent hydrochloric acid, and heated on the water-bath, with\r\nfrequent shaking, for three hours.\r\n\r\nThe soluble materials are determined in the filtrate by some of the\r\nmethods usually employed.\r\n\r\n=336. The Gembloux Method.=—The method of making the acid extract of the\r\nsoil at the Gembloux Station does not differ greatly from some of those\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of air-dried material taken is such that it may weigh\r\nexactly 300 grams exclusive of the moisture which it contains. It is\r\ndried at 150° for at least six hours. The drying is necessary in order\r\nto obtain an extract in hydrochloric acid of exactly 1.18 specific\r\ngravity. The dry earth is placed in a flask of two or three liters\r\ncapacity to which one liter of hydrochloric acid of 1.18 specific\r\ngravity is added, being careful to take precautions to prevent frothing\r\nif much carbonate be present. The acid is allowed to act for twenty-four\r\nhours, it being frequently shaken meanwhile. After settling it is\r\ndecanted and filtered upon a double folded filter, the apex of which\r\nrests upon a small funnel covered with a plain filter of strong paper.\r\nFive hundred cubic centimeters of the filtrate are taken for the\r\nestimation, and in this filtrate are estimated the silica, phosphoric\r\nand sulfuric acids, potash, soda, iron, alumina, lime, and magnesia.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate is evaporated to dryness in a porcelain capsule, a few\r\ndrops of nitric acid added and the liquid kept well stirred. The residue\r\nshould be taken up with water, and if not perfectly bright a second and\r\neven a third evaporation with nitric acid should take place, until all\r\nthe organic matter is destroyed, which will be indicated by the clear\r\nyellow or reddish-yellow color of the liquid, caused by the iron oxid.\r\nAfter the last evaporation the material is dried in a drying oven one\r\nhour at 110°.\r\n\r\n=337. Treatment with Cold Hydrochloric Acid.=—According to the digestion\r\nmethod of Wolff[218] the soil sample is treated with cold concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid. The process is as follows:\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty grams of the soil dried at 100° are placed in a\r\nglass flask and treated with 1,500 cubic centimeters of hydrochloric\r\nacid of 1.15 specific gravity, corresponding to thirty per cent of\r\ngaseous hydrochloric acid. For every five per cent of calcium carbonate\r\nwhich the soil may contain, an additional fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nhydrochloric acid are added. With frequent stirring, the soil is left in\r\ncontact with the acid for forty-eight hours and then 1,000 cubic\r\ncentimeters of liquid, as clear as possible, are poured off, which\r\ncorresponds to 300 grams of the soil. After dilution with water it is\r\nfiltered and the filtrate treated with a few drops of nitric acid and\r\nevaporated to dryness. After the separation of the silica the solution\r\nis again made up with water to 1,000 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred cubic centimeters of this solution, corresponding to sixty\r\ngrams of the soil, are taken for the estimation of iron, alumina, lime,\r\nmanganese, and magnesia.\r\n\r\nFour hundred cubic centimeters of the solution, corresponding to 120\r\ngrams of the soil, are left for the estimation of sulfuric acid and\r\nalkalies. This method gives from five to six times less alkalies and a\r\nmuch smaller quantity of iron than the treatment with hot acid. In the\r\nuse of hot acid, therefore, Wolff reduces the quantity of soil acted on\r\nto 150 grams.\r\n\r\n=338. Treatment with Nitric Acid.=—For the purpose of estimating\r\nphosphoric acid Grandeau[219] directs that the soil be extracted with\r\nnitric acid. For this purpose 100 grams of the air-dried fine earth are\r\nplaced in a bohemian flask and treated cautiously with nitric acid in\r\nsmall quantities at a time. If the soil be calcareous in its nature it\r\nshould be previously moistened with water, and the acid so added as to\r\navoid undue effervescence, the flask being inclined during the\r\noperation. Sufficient acid is added to strongly saturate the sample and\r\nit is then digested on the sand-bath for two hours; or at least until\r\nthe organic matters are destroyed, which will be indicated by the\r\ncessation of evolution of nitrous vapors. When the supernatant liquid\r\nhas become clear it is decanted. The residue is washed with distilled\r\nwater and separated on a filter, and washed until the wash-water is\r\ncolorless. The decanted portion is united with the filtrate and the\r\nwhole made up to a volume of one liter. The determinations are made in\r\nportions of 200 cubic centimeters each.\r\n\r\n=339. Digestion with Hydrofluoric and Sulfuric Acids.=—When a complete\r\ndisintegration of the siliceous substances in soils is desired as in\r\nanalysis in bulk, the decomposition is easily accomplished by digestion\r\nwith the above named acids in a platinum dish. The fine earth is\r\nsaturated with a concentrated aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid to\r\nwhich a few drops of sulfuric acid are added. It is then digested until\r\nnearly dry. If any undecomposed particles remain, the treatment is\r\ncontinued until complete decomposition is secured. The silica is thus\r\nall volatilized as hydrofluosilicic acid and the bases pre-existing in\r\nthe soil are left as sulfates. This method of treatment is especially\r\nrecommended when it is desired to estimate the whole quantity of any of\r\nthe soil constituents with the exception of silica. The silica may,\r\nhowever, be determined in the distillate. Instead of using the solution\r\nof hydrofluoric acid, ammonium fluorid may be employed. In this process\r\nthe sample of earth reduced to an impalpable powder by grinding in an\r\nagate mortar is mixed with four or five times its weight of the ammonium\r\nfluorid in a platinum dish and thoroughly moistened with sulfuric acid\r\nand allowed to stand at room temperature for several hours. It is then\r\ngently heated until all fumes of hydrofluosilicic acid have been driven\r\noff, but is not raised to a red heat. If any undecomposed particles\r\nremain, the above treatment is repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n           DETERMINATION OF THE QUANTITY OF DISSOLVED MATTER.\r\n\r\n=340. Substances in Solution.=—By treatment with solvents as indicated\r\nin the preceding paragraphs, greater or less quantities of the original\r\nconstituents of soil are brought into solution. The total quantity of\r\ndissolved matters is determined by drying and weighing the insoluble\r\nresidue and the percentages of soluble and insoluble matters should be\r\nnoted; and each portion saved for further examination. In this country\r\nthe common practice of soil analysis is to digest the sample with\r\nhydrochloric acid. The following paragraphs, therefore, will be devoted\r\nto the general methods of determining the matters dissolved by that\r\ntreatment, leaving for later consideration the special methods of\r\nanalysis. The fundamental principle on which the treatment with\r\nhydrochloric acid rests is based on the belief that such treatment\r\npractically extracts from the soil all those elements which are likely\r\nto become, immediately or in the near future, available for plant food.\r\n\r\n=341. Provisional Methods of the Official Agricultural\r\nChemists.=[220]—(1) _The Analytical Operations_ are conducted with\r\nsolution A, paragraph =334=.\r\n\r\n(2) _Ferric Oxid, Alumina, and Phosphoric Acid._—To 100 or 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters, according to the probable amount of iron present, of the\r\nsolution A, add ammonium hydroxid to alkaline reaction to precipitate\r\nferric and aluminum oxids and phosphates. Expel the excess of ammonia by\r\nboiling, allow to settle, decant the clear solution through a filter;\r\nadd to the flask fifty cubic centimeters of hot distilled water, boil,\r\nsettle, and decant as before. After pouring off all the clear solution\r\npossible, dissolve the residue with a few drops of warm hydrochloric\r\nacid and add just enough ammonium hydroxid to precipitate the oxids.\r\nWash by decantation with fifty cubic centimeters of distilled water, and\r\nthen transfer all the precipitate to the filter and wash with hot\r\ndistilled water till the filtrate becomes free from chlorids. Save the\r\nfiltrate and washings which form solution B. Dry the filter and\r\nprecipitate at 110°, transfer the precipitate to a tared platinum\r\ncrucible, burn the filter and add the ash to the precipitate, heat the\r\nwhole red hot, cool in a desiccator, and weigh. The increase of weight,\r\nminus the ash of filter and the phosphoric acid (found in a separate\r\nprocess), represents the weight of the ferric and aluminum oxids.\r\n\r\n(3) _Ferric Oxid._—Precipitate 100 cubic centimeters of solution A, as\r\nunder (2), except that only one precipitation is made; wash with hot\r\nwater; dissolve in dilute sulfuric acid; reduce with zinc and estimate\r\nas ferrous oxid by a standard solution of potassium permanganate.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the potassium permanganate solution, dissolve 3.156 grams of\r\npure crystallized potassium permanganate in 1,000 cubic centimeters of\r\ndistilled water, and preserve in a glass-stoppered bottle, shielded from\r\nthe light. Standardize this solution with pure ferrous sulfate, ammonium\r\nferrous sulfate or oxalic acid.\r\n\r\n(4) _Alumina._—The calculated weight of ferric oxid deducted from that\r\nof ferric oxid and alumina with corrections for filter ash and\r\nphosphoric acid, will give the weight of alumina in two grams of\r\nair-dried soil.\r\n\r\n(5) _Phosphoric Acid._—This may be estimated in the above iron solution,\r\nif the soil is sufficiently rich, by the molybdate method, given under\r\nfertilizers; or if the quantity of soil represented in the iron solution\r\nis not sufficient, a fresh portion of solution A may be taken, and the\r\nphosphoric acid determined directly by the molybdate method.\r\n\r\n(6) _Manganese._—Concentrate the filtrate and washings (solution B) to\r\n200 cubic centimeters or less; add ammonium hydroxid to alkalinity; add\r\nbromin water and heat to boiling, keeping the beaker covered with a\r\nwatch-glass; as the bromin escapes, the beaker is allowed to cool\r\nsomewhat, ammonia and bromin water again added, and heated as before.\r\n\r\nThis process is continued until the manganese is completely\r\nprecipitated, which requires from thirty to sixty minutes, and the\r\nsolution filtered while still warm; the precipitate is washed, dried,\r\nignited and weighed; estimate as manganese protosesquioxid.\r\n\r\n(7) _Lime._—If no manganese is precipitated, add to solution B, or the\r\nfiltrate and washings from (6) twenty cubic centimeters of a strong\r\nsolution of ammonium chlorid and forty cubic centimeters of saturated\r\nsolution of ammonium oxalate to completely precipitate all the lime as\r\noxalate and convert the magnesia into soluble magnesium oxalate. Heat to\r\nboiling and let stand for six hours till the calcium oxalate settles\r\nclear, decant the clear solution on a filter, pour fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of hot distilled water on the precipitate and again decant\r\nthe clear solution on the filter, transfer the precipitate to the\r\nfilter, and wash it free from all traces of oxalates and chlorids. Dry\r\nand ignite the precipitate over the blast-lamp until it ceases to lose\r\nweight, weigh and estimate as calcium oxid; carefully moisten with\r\nsulfuric acid, heat the inclined covered crucible gently to avoid loss,\r\nthen intensely, and weigh as calcium sulfate.\r\n\r\n(8) _Magnesia._—Concentrate the filtrate and washings (from 7) to 200\r\ncubic centimeters, place in a half-liter erlenmeyer, add thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of a saturated solution of sodium phosphate and twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of concentrated ammonium hydroxid, cork the flask, and shake\r\nviolently at intervals of a few minutes till crystals form, then set the\r\nflask in a cool place for twelve hours. Filter the clear liquid through\r\na tared gooch, transfer the precipitate to the filter, and wash with\r\ndilute ammonium hydroxid (1 : 3) till the filtrate is free from\r\nphosphates; dry and ignite the crucible, at first gently and then\r\nintensely, to form magnesium pyrophosphate. The increase of weight ×\r\n0.36024 = MgO. By using an erlenmeyer free from scratches and marks, and\r\nshaking violently instead of stirring with a glass rod, the danger is\r\nalmost entirely avoided of crystals adhering to the sides of the vessel;\r\nbut if crystals do adhere they are readily removed by a rubber-tipped\r\nglass rod.\r\n\r\n(9) _Sulfuric Acid._—Evaporate 200 cubic centimeters of solution A (1)\r\nnearly to dryness on a water-bath to expel the excess of acid; then add\r\n100 cubic centimeters of distilled water, heat to boiling and add ten\r\ncubic centimeters of a solution of barium chlorid, and continue the\r\nboiling for five minutes. When the precipitate has settled, pour the\r\nclear liquid on a tared gooch, treat the precipitate with fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of boiling water, and transfer the precipitate to the filter\r\nand wash with boiling water till the filtrate is free from chlorids. Dry\r\nthe filter and ignite strongly. The increase in weight is barium\r\nsulfate, which multiplied by 0.34331 = SO₃ in two grams of air-dried\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n(10) _Potash and Soda._—To another portion of 200 cubic centimeters of\r\nsolution A, add barium chlorid in slight excess, and make alkaline with\r\nammonia to precipitate sulfuric and phosphoric acids, ferric oxid, etc.\r\nThen precipitate the calcium and barium by ammonium oxalate. Evaporate\r\nthe filtrate and washings to dryness, heat to a low red heat to\r\ndecompose oxalates and expel ammonia salts, dissolve in twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of distilled water, filter and wash the precipitate;\r\nadd to the filtrate and washings ten cubic centimeters of baryta water,\r\nand digest for an hour. Filter and wash the precipitate, add ammonium\r\ncarbonate to the filtrate to complete precipitation of baryta, filter\r\nand wash this precipitate. Evaporate the filtrate and washings in a\r\ntared platinum dish, gently ignite the residue to expel ammonia salts,\r\ncool and weigh. The increase of weight represents the potassium and\r\nsodium chlorids in two grams of air-dried soil.\r\n\r\n=342. Hilgard’s Methods.=[221]—(1) _Soluble Silica._— The acid filtrate\r\nobtained by the process given in paragraph =333= is employed for the\r\nfollowing determinations. After the solution obtained has been\r\nevaporated to dryness to render silica insoluble, it is moistened with\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid and two or three drops of nitric acid. The mass\r\nis warmed, and after allowing to stand for a few hours on a steam-bath\r\nis taken up with distilled water. After clearing, it is filtered from\r\nthe insoluble residue, which is strongly ignited and weighed. If the\r\nfiltrate should be turbid the insoluble residue which has gone through\r\nthe filter can be recovered in the iron and alumina determination.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble residue is next boiled for fifteen or twenty minutes in a\r\nconcentrated solution of sodium carbonate, to which a few drops of\r\ncaustic lye should then be added to prevent reprecipitation of the\r\ndissolved silica. The solution must be filtered hot. The difference\r\nbetween the weight of the total residue and that of undissolved sand and\r\nmineral powder is recorded as soluble silica, being the aggregate of\r\nthat set free by the acid treatment and that previously existing in the\r\nsoil. The latter, however, rarely reaches five per cent.\r\n\r\n(2) _Destruction of Organic Matter._—The acid filtrate from the total\r\ninsoluble residue is evaporated to a convenient bulk. In case the\r\nfiltrate should indicate by its color, the presence of any organic\r\nmatter, it should be oxidized by aqua regia, otherwise there will be\r\ndifficulty in separating alumina.\r\n\r\n(3) _Precipitation of Iron and Alumina._—The filtrate thus prepared is\r\nnow brought to boiling and treated sparingly with ammonia, whereby iron\r\nand alumina are precipitated. It is kept boiling until the excess of\r\nammonia is driven off, and then filtered hot. (Filtrate A.) The previous\r\naddition of ammonium chlorid is usually unnecessary. If the boiling is\r\ncontinued too long, filtration becomes very difficult and a part of the\r\nprecipitate may redissolve in washing. Filtration may be begun as soon\r\nas the nose fails to note the presence of free ammonia; test paper is\r\ntoo delicate. Failure to boil long enough involves the contamination of\r\nthe iron-alumina precipitate with lime and manganese.\r\n\r\n(4) _Estimation of Iron and Alumina._—The iron and alumina precipitate\r\nwith filter of (3) is dissolved in a mixture of about five cubic\r\ncentimeters of hydrochloric acid and twenty cubic centimeters of water.\r\nThen filter and make up to 150 cubic centimeters. Take fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters for the determination of iron and alumina together by\r\nprecipitation with ammonia, after oxidizing the organic matter (filter)\r\nwith aqua regia; also fifty cubic centimeters for iron alone; keep fifty\r\ncubic centimeters in reserve. Determine the iron by means of a standard\r\nsolution of potassium permanganate after reduction; this latter is done\r\nby evaporating the fifty cubic centimeters almost to dryness with strong\r\nsulfuric acid, adding water and transferring the solution to a flask,\r\nand then reducing by means of pure metallic zinc in the usual way. The\r\nalumina is then determined by difference. This method of determining the\r\ntwo oxids in their intermixture is in several respects more satisfactory\r\nthan the separation with alkaline lye, which, however, has served for\r\nmost determinations made, until within the last ten years. It is,\r\nhowever, much more liable to miscarry in unpracticed hands than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n(5) _Estimation of Lime._—The filtrate A from iron and alumina is\r\nacidified slightly with hydrochloric acid, and if too bulky is\r\nevaporated to about twenty-five cubic centimeters, unless the soil is a\r\nvery calcareous one, and the lime is precipitated from it by\r\nneutralizing with ammonia and adding ammonium oxalate. The precipitation\r\nof the lime should be done in the hot solution, as the precipitate\r\nsettles much more easily. It is allowed to stand for twelve hours, then\r\nfiltered (filtrate B), washed with cold water, and dried. By ignition\r\nthe lime precipitate is partially converted into the oxid. It is then\r\nheated with excess of powdered ammonium carbonate, moistened with water,\r\nand exposed to a gentle heat (50°–80°) until all the ammonia is\r\nexpelled. It is then dried below red heat and weighed as calcium\r\ncarbonate. When the amount of lime is at all considerable, the treatment\r\nwith ammonium carbonate must be repeated till a constant weight is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n(6) _Estimation of Sulfuric Arid._—The filtrate B from the calcium\r\noxalate is put into a bohemian flask, boiled down over the sand-bath,\r\nand the ammoniacal salts destroyed with aqua regia. From the flask it is\r\nremoved to a small beaker and evaporated to dryness with excess of\r\nnitric acid. This process usually occupies four to five hours. The\r\nresidue should be crystalline-granular; if white-opaque, ammonium\r\nnitrate remains and must be destroyed by hydrochloric acid. The dry\r\nresidue is now moistened with nitric acid, and the floccules of silica\r\nusually present separated by filtration from the filtrate, which should\r\nnot amount to more than ten or fifteen cubic centimeters; sulfur trioxid\r\nis then precipitated by treatment with a few drops of barium nitrate,\r\nboth the solution and the reagent being heated to boiling. If the\r\nquantity of sulfuric acid is large it may be filtered after the lapse of\r\nfour or five hours (filtrate C). If very small let it stand twelve\r\nhours. The precipitate is washed with boiling water, dried, ignited, and\r\nweighed. Care should be taken in adding the barium nitrate to use only\r\nthe least possible excess, because in such a small concentrated acid\r\nsolution the excess of barium nitrate may crystallize and will not\r\nreadily dissolve in hot water. Care must also be taken not to leave in\r\nthe beaker the large heavy crystals of barium sulfate, of which a few\r\nsometimes constitute the entire precipitate, rarely exceeding a few\r\nmilligrams. Should the ignited precipitate show an alkaline reaction on\r\nmoistening with water, it must be treated with a drop of hydrochloric\r\nacid, refiltered and weighed. The use of barium acetate involves\r\nunnecessary trouble in this determination.\r\n\r\n(7) _Estimation of Sodium and Potassium._—Filtrate C is now evaporated\r\nto dryness in a platinum dish; the residue is treated with an excess of\r\ncrystallized oxalic acid, moistened with water, and exposed to gentle\r\nheat. It is then strongly ignited to change the oxalates to carbonates.\r\nThis treatment with oxalic acid must be made in a vessel which can be\r\nkept well covered, otherwise there is danger of loss through spattering.\r\nAs little water as possible should be used, as otherwise loss from\r\nevolution of carbon dioxid is difficult to avoid. Spatters on the cover\r\nshould not be washed back into the basin until after the excess of\r\noxalic acid has been volatilized. The ignited mass should have a\r\nslightly blackish tinge to prove the conversion of the nitrates into\r\ncarbonates. White portions may be locally retreated with oxalic acid.\r\nThe ignited mass is treated with a small amount of water, which\r\ndissolves the alkaline carbonates and leaves the magnesium carbonate,\r\nmanganese protosesquioxid, and the excess of barium carbonate behind.\r\nThe alkalies are separated by filtration into a small platinum dish\r\n(filtrate D), and the residue is well but sparingly washed with water on\r\na small filter. When the filtrate exceeds ten cubic centimeters it may,\r\non evaporation, show so much turbidity from dissolved earthy carbonates\r\nas to render refiltration on a small filter necessary, since otherwise\r\nthe soda percentage will be found too large and magnesia too small. If,\r\non dissolving the ignited mass, the solution should appear greenish from\r\nthe formation of alkaline manganates, add a few drops of alcohol to\r\nreduce the manganese to insoluble dioxid. The residue of barium,\r\nmagnesium, and manganese compounds is treated on the filter with\r\nhydrochloric acid, and the platinum dish is washed with warm nitric acid\r\n(not hydrochloric, for the platinum dish may be attacked by chlorin from\r\nthe manganese oxid) dissolving any small traces of precipitate that may\r\nhave been left behind.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate D, which should not be more than ten or fifteen cubic\r\ncentimeters, containing the carbonates of the alkalies, is evaporated to\r\ndryness and gently fused, so as to render insoluble any magnesium\r\ncarbonate that may have gone through; then redissolved and filtered into\r\na small weighed platinum dish containing a few drops of dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, to change the carbonates into chlorids; evaporated to\r\ndryness, exposed to a gradually rising temperature (below red heat), by\r\nwhich the chlorids are thoroughly dried and freed from moisture, so as\r\nto prevent the decrepitation that would otherwise occur on ignition.\r\nThen, holding the platinum basin firmly by forceps grasping the clean\r\nedge, pass it carefully over a very low bunsen flame, so as to cause,\r\nsuccessively, every portion of the scaly or powdery residue to collapse,\r\nwithout fully fusing. There is thus no loss from volatilization, and no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining an accurate, constant weight. The weighed\r\nchlorids are washed by means of a little water into a small beaker or\r\nporcelain dish, treated with a sufficient quantity of platinum chlorid,\r\nand evaporated to dryness over the water-bath. The dried residue is\r\ntreated with a mixture of three parts absolute alcohol and one part\r\nether, leaving the potassium platinochlorid undissolved. This is put on\r\na filter, and washed with ether-alcohol. When dried, the precipitate and\r\nfilter are put into a small platinum crucible and exposed to a heat\r\nsufficiently intense to reduce the platinum chlorid to metallic platinum\r\nand to volatilize the greater part of the potassium chlorid. This is\r\neasily accomplished in a small crucible, which is roughened by being\r\nconstantly used for the same purpose (and no other), the spongy metal\r\ncausing a ready evolution of the gases. The reduced platinum is now\r\nfirst washed in the crucible with hot acidulated water, then with pure\r\nwater; then all moisture is driven off and it is weighed. From the\r\nweight of the platinum, is calculated the potassium chlorid and the oxid\r\ncorresponding; the difference between the weights of the total alkaline\r\nchlorids and potassium chlorid gives the sodium chlorid, from which may\r\nbe calculated the sodium oxid. When the heating of the platinum\r\nprecipitate has not been sufficient in time or intensity, instead of\r\nbeing in a solid spongy mass of the color of the crucible itself, small\r\nblack particles of metallic platinum will obstinately float on the\r\nsurface of the water in the crucible, and it becomes difficult to wash\r\nwithout loss.\r\n\r\n(8) _Estimation of Manganese._—The solution containing the magnesium and\r\nmanganese chlorids is freed from barium salts by hot precipitation with\r\nsulfuric acid, and the barium sulfate, after settling a few hours, is\r\nseparated by filtration. The filtrate is neutralized with ammonia, any\r\nresulting small precipitate (of iron) is filtered, and the manganese\r\nprecipitated with ammonium sulfid, let stand twelve hours and filtered\r\n(filtrate E); wash with cold water, dry, ignite, and weigh as manganese\r\nprotosesquioxid, Mn₃O₄. If preferred the manganese may be precipitated\r\nwith chlorin or bromin water as dioxid; but the process requires a\r\nrather longer time and may fail in inexpert hands more readily than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n(9) _Estimation of Magnesium._—The filtrate E from the manganese is now\r\nfreed from sulfur by acidulating with hydrochloric acid, evaporating, if\r\nnecessary, and filtering. From the filtrate the magnesia is precipitated\r\nby adding an equal bulk of ammonia water and then sodium phosphate.\r\nAfter standing at least twenty-four hours, the magnesium salt may be\r\nfiltered, washed with ammoniacal water, dried, ignited, and weighed as\r\nmagnesium pyrophosphate.\r\n\r\n=343. Examination of Acid Extract by the Methods of\r\nPetermann.=—_Estimation of the Silica._—The Gembloux method of\r\nestimating silica consists in taking up the dry extract obtained from\r\nthe treatment of the earth, in the manner described in paragraph =336=,\r\nwith water and a few drops of hydrochloric acid, heating for a short\r\ntime on a sand-bath to facilitate the solution, and filtering, washing,\r\ndrying, igniting, and weighing the residue obtained as silica.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Sulfuric Acid._—The method employed consists in\r\nheating the filtrate obtained in the estimation of silica for half an\r\nhour with a few drops of nitric acid and making the volume up to 500\r\ncubic centimeters. One hundred cubic centimeters of this are\r\nprecipitated with barium chlorid, diluted to double its volume, heated\r\nfor some time, the precipitate of barium sulfate collected and weighed,\r\nand the quantity of sulfuric acid calculated therefrom.\r\n\r\n_Potash and Soda._—Potash and soda are estimated at the Gembloux Station\r\nby heating the filtrate obtained in the estimation of the sulfuric acid\r\nand precipitating the excess of barium in the hot solution after the\r\naddition of ammonia by ammonium oxalate and carbonate. The whole is\r\nallowed to digest for six hours at a gentle heat and then allowed to\r\nremain at rest for twenty-four hours, filtered, washed, and the filtrate\r\nevaporated to dryness in a large platinum dish and the ammoniacal salts\r\ndriven off at a low temperature. At the end, the temperature is carried\r\na little higher until it reaches low redness. The residue is taken up by\r\ndistilled water, filtered into a weighed platinum dish, a few drops of\r\nhydrochloric acid added, evaporated, dried, heated with great care and\r\nthe sodium and potassium chlorids obtained weighed together. The\r\nrespective quantities of potash and soda in the earth are estimated in\r\nthe usual way by precipitating the potash with platinum chlorid.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Iron and Aluminum Oxids._—The iron and aluminum oxids\r\nare estimated by taking twenty-five cubic centimeters of the primitive\r\nsolution obtained with hydrochloric acid and adding ammonium carbonate\r\nalmost to complete neutralization, that is to say until the precipitate\r\nformed is just redissolved in the feeble excess of hydrochloric acid\r\nwhich remains. Dilute with distilled water and precipitate with a little\r\nexcess of ammonium acetate, and boil for a moment; after boiling, the\r\nbasic iron and aluminum acetate and the small quantity of iron and\r\naluminum phosphate present are easily deposited, and the supernatant\r\nliquid should be completely limpid and colorless. Wash the precipitate\r\nby decantation, boiling each time, filter, wash the filter with boiling\r\nwater to which a little ammonium acetate has been added, dry, ignite,\r\nand weigh. The material obtained consists of ferric oxid, aluminum oxid,\r\nand iron and aluminum phosphates. Deduct from the whole, the phosphoric\r\nacid determined in another portion. The residue will be the sum of the\r\niron and aluminum oxids.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Lime._—The filtrate from the portion used for the\r\nestimation of the iron and alumina is treated with ammonium oxalate. The\r\nmixture is kept at a low temperature for at least twelve hours, after\r\nwhich it is filtered, washed with hot water, dried, and ignited over a\r\nblast-lamp to constant weight and weighed as calcium oxid.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Magnesia._—For the estimation of the magnesia the\r\nfiltrate obtained in the estimation of lime is evaporated to dryness in\r\na platinum dish, the ammoniacal salts driven off, the residue taken up\r\nwith water slightly acidified with hydrochloric acid, filtered, the\r\nfiltrate saturated with ammonia and heated some time to the boiling\r\npoint to precipitate any traces of iron and alumina which may have\r\nremained in solution. Filter, wash, allow to cool and precipitate the\r\nmagnesia by the addition of sodium phosphate. It is then allowed to\r\nstand for twelve hours, collected on a filter, ignited, and weighed as\r\npyrophosphate, and the quantity of magnesia calculated from the weight\r\nof salt obtained.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Phosphoric Acid._—The phosphoric acid is estimated by\r\ntaking 100 cubic centimeters of the original solution obtained by the\r\ntreatment of the soil with hydrochloric acid and evaporating it to\r\ndryness on the water-bath. The residue is taken up with water to which a\r\nfew drops of nitric acid have been added and filtered. The total\r\nphosphoric acid is then obtained by precipitation with ammonium\r\nmolybdate in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=344. Analysis of the Insoluble Residue.=—The insoluble residue left\r\nafter digestion with hydrochloric acid is not without interest from an\r\nagricultural and analytical point of view. While it is true that the\r\nplant food, therein contained, is not immediately available, yet it must\r\nnot be forgotten that the method of the chemist may not fix a limit to\r\nnature’s method of collecting nutriment for plants. In however\r\nrefractory a state they may exist, it is possible that all nutritive\r\nelements may eventually become available for assimilation. For the\r\ncompletion of an estimate of the total nutritive power of a soil,\r\ntherefore a further examination of the insoluble residue should be made.\r\nThe methods of securing this are essentially those of making a bulk\r\nanalysis of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the method depends on the reduction of the sample to an\r\nimpalpable powder and the subsequent decomposition of the insoluble\r\nportions by treatment with hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids or by fusion\r\nwith the alkalies.\r\n\r\n=345. Method of Wolff for Treating Residue Insoluble in Hot Acid.=—The\r\nwell-washed residue is dried with the filter, then separated therefrom,\r\nthe filter burned and the ash weighed with the whole of the residue.\r\nAbout eight grams of the residue are ignited and serve for the\r\nestimation of the insoluble mineral matter. Another portion of ten grams\r\nof the dried, but not ignited, residue is boiled with a concentrated\r\nsolution of sodium carbonate with the addition of caustic soda, and the\r\nquantity of dissolved silicic acid estimated. A third portion of about\r\nfifteen grams is treated with about five times its weight of pure\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid, and is evaporated until the mass has taken\r\nthe form of a dry powder. After moistening with concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid the mass is boiled with water, filtered, and the\r\nfiltrate examined according to the ordinary methods for silicic acid,\r\nalumina, iron, lime, magnesia, and alkalies. The residue after treatment\r\nwith concentrated sulfuric acid is dried, but not ignited, and boiled\r\nwith a concentrated solution of sodium carbonate with the addition of a\r\nlittle caustic soda, filtered, heated, and the silicic acid separated\r\nfrom the solution. After thorough washing, the residue, after ignition,\r\nis weighed and represents the material insoluble in concentrated\r\nhydrochloric and sulfuric acids. The silicic acid found as before,\r\ntogether with the small quantity dissolved in the hydrochloric acid\r\nextract, gives, in connection with the alumina contained in the sulfuric\r\nacid extract, approximately the quantity of pure water-free clay\r\ncontained in the soil.\r\n\r\nIn six samples of soils of very different compositions which were\r\nexamined by the above process, it was found that the clay had the\r\nfollowing mean composition: Silicic acid, 55.1 to 61.5 per cent,\r\nalumina, 38.6 to 44.9 per cent; as a mean 58.05 per cent silicic acid\r\nand 41.95 per cent alumina.\r\n\r\nFinally, four or five grams of the residue, after treatment with\r\nsulfuric acid and sodium carbonate, are rubbed up in an agate mortar and\r\ncompletely separated into silt by water. The silt mass is dried, lightly\r\nignited, and three grams of it spread in a flat platinum dish moistened\r\nwith sulfuric acid, and subjected to the action of hydrofluoric acid in\r\na lead oven at 60°, until a complete decomposition of the material is\r\naccomplished. In the solution all the different bases can be determined.\r\n\r\n=346. Method of the Belgian Chemists.=—The method employed by\r\nPetermann[222] at the Gembloux Station in the examination of the part of\r\nthe soil insoluble in hydrochloric acid consists in washing the\r\ninsoluble portion by decantation with distilled water until all acid\r\nreaction is removed. Place the contents of the flask and of the filter\r\nin a porcelain dish and dry. After a careful mixing of the mass take out\r\nabout fifty grams and wash upon the filter until all reaction for\r\nchlorin has disappeared, dry, detach the mass from the filter, and\r\nincinerate. Place in a platinum crucible two grams of the ground and\r\nignited residue and mix it, using a platinum stirring rod, with twelve\r\ngrams of ammonium fluorid; heat slightly over a bunsen burner in a\r\nmuffle with a good draught and regulate the flame in such a way that the\r\noperation shall continue for about one hour. After complete\r\ndecomposition add about two cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid in such a\r\nway as to moisten completely the residue, drive off the sulfuric acid\r\ncarefully at a low red heat and take up the residue with water slightly\r\nacidulated with hydrochloric acid and wash the whole into a flask of 500\r\ncubic centimeters capacity. Oxidize by heating for an hour with nitric\r\nacid, make up to the mark and filter. The percentages of potash, soda,\r\nlime, magnesia, and the silicates are determined exactly as in the\r\nhydrochloric acid extract.\r\n\r\n=347. Bulk Analysis.=—It is frequently desirable to determine the total\r\ncomposition of a soil sample as well as the nature of that part of it\r\nsoluble in any of the solvents usually employed. The latest methods for\r\nthis purpose have been well studied by Packard[223] who finds that the\r\nvariations which occur between duplicates are probably due to the small\r\nquantities of material taken for analysis, it being difficult to obtain\r\naverage samples of a material which is not very finely powdered when\r\nsmall quantities are taken. Moreover, as it is likely to become of\r\nimportance to know whether the proportions of lime and magnesia vary by\r\nas much as one-tenth per cent, and such small variations are within the\r\nlimits of error of an analysis, and as the total proportion of lime and\r\nmagnesia in highly siliceous soils, probably does not exceed one-tenth\r\nper cent, it is deemed best to take a large quantity of soil for the\r\nbulk analysis in each case. The amount adopted for the highly siliceous\r\nsoils containing much quartz is ten grams. This quantity, taken after\r\nquartering down the entire sample, is ground to an impalpable powder and\r\nused for the determination of the lime, magnesia, and alkalies, the\r\nsilica, iron oxid, alumina, and loss on ignition, being determined in\r\none gram samples. The ten grams are decomposed by hydrofluoric and\r\nsulfuric acids in a large platinum dish, the solution evaporated, at\r\nfirst on the water-bath until all water is removed and then at a higher\r\ntemperature until all the free sulfuric acid is driven off, when the\r\nresidue is heated in a muffle at a low red heat for several hours. At\r\nthis temperature the sulfuric acid combined with the iron oxid and\r\nalumina is driven off, leaving the remaining sulfates unchanged and the\r\niron oxid and alumina are in the form of a powder of no great volume\r\nwhich is easily and quickly washed. This operation is usually successful\r\nat first but in some cases the decomposition is not complete as is shown\r\nby the appearance of a precipitate on adding ammonia to the filtrate\r\nfrom the aluminum and iron oxids. In such cases the precipitate is\r\ndissolved in hydrochloric acid, reprecipitated by ammonia and removed by\r\nfiltration. In the filtrate from the thoroughly washed aluminum and iron\r\noxids, lime is precipitated as oxalate and separated by filtration; the\r\nfiltrate is evaporated to dryness and the ammonia salts driven off by\r\nheat; the magnesia in the unfiltered watery extract of this residue is\r\nprecipitated by baryta water, which also removes the sulfuric acid with\r\nwhich the bases had been combined. In the filtrate from this precipitate\r\nbaryta is precipitated by ammonium carbonate and removed by filtration,\r\nleaving the alkalies to be determined in the usual way after conversion\r\ninto chlorids. The mixed precipitate of magnesia and barium sulfate is\r\ntreated with hydrochloric acid, filtered, the baryta present removed as\r\nsulfate, and the magnesia precipitated in the filtrate from the latter\r\nas phosphate. The advantages of this method are that the large quantity\r\nof material employed gives some assurance that an average sample has\r\nbeen operated on, and all the bases present in small proportions are\r\nestimated in the same sample. The objection to it is the time consumed\r\nboth in grinding the samples and in determining all the bases in one\r\nsolution. As a small quantity of material is generally used for\r\ndetermining the silica, iron oxid, alumina, and loss by ignition, and a\r\nlarger quantity for the remaining bases, slight differences in the\r\nunground samples are unavoidable, especially when the quartz grains are\r\nsomewhat large, it being practically impossible to take two small\r\nsamples of such a soil which would have the same number of quartz\r\ngrains. Consequently tedious grinding of large quantities of the soils\r\nfor the bulk analysis is necessary. This objection does not apply to the\r\nofficial analysis or assay of soils in which considerable quantities are\r\nextracted by acid and the solution analyzed, and silica is not\r\ndetermined. In any case, it may be said, when it becomes an object to\r\nknow whether a soil contains a total of 0.1 or 0.2 per cent of lime or\r\nmagnesia, of 0.7 or 0.5 per cent of potash, one analysis even of the\r\nlarge quantity of ten grams would be insufficient to decide the point,\r\nand at least the mean of two determinations should be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n         SPECIAL METHODS OF DETERMINATION OF SOIL CONSTITUENTS.\r\n\r\n=348. Preliminary Considerations.=—In the foregoing paragraphs the\r\ngeneral outline of the chemical methods of soil examination have been\r\ngiven. There are often occasions, however, which demand a special study\r\nof some particular soil constituent. It has been thought proper,\r\ntherefore, to add here some of the best approved methods of special\r\ndeterminations which have been approved in this and other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the main, the final determination of any particular element of the\r\nsoil, and its previous separation from accompanying elements, are based\r\non the general processes already given. The variations in many\r\ninstances, however, seem to require special mention.\r\n\r\n=349. Condition of Potash in Soils.=—Potash exists in the soil in very\r\ndifferent states. That part of it which is combined with the humus\r\nmaterial, or with the hydrated silicates, is easily set free from its\r\ncombinations and is to be regarded as the more assimilable portion.\r\n\r\nThe potash in the soil is found chiefly in combination with silicates,\r\nand particularly with the hydrated aluminum silicates, forming clay. As\r\nthe particles with which it is combined are found in a state of greater\r\nor less fineness, the potash itself is set free under the influences of\r\nthe agents which are active in the soil, with greater or less rapidity,\r\npassing into a form in which it can be utilized by plants. In silicates\r\nwhich are very finely divided, such as clay, the potash becomes active\r\nin a relatively short time, while in the débris of rocks in a less\r\nadvanced state of decomposition it may rest for an indefinite period in\r\nan inert state. The estimation of the potash which is assimilable in the\r\nclay is quite as important for agricultural purposes as to determine\r\nthat which may be present in the soil in firmer combination. Treating\r\nthe sample of soil with water does not furnish any useful information in\r\nregard to the potash which it contains. Indeed, the absorbing properties\r\nof the soil tend to prevent the elimination of the potash in this way,\r\neven when it is found in the soluble state. It is therefore, necessary\r\nto employ an acid to set the potash free, but variable results are\r\nobtained, according to the employment of acids of greater or less\r\nconcentration and for longer or shorter periods of contact.\r\n\r\n=350. Estimation of the Potash Soluble in Concentrated Acids.=—In the\r\nmethod of the French agricultural chemists[224] twenty grams of the\r\nearth are placed in a dish with a flat bottom, eleven centimeters in\r\ndiameter, and rubbed up with twenty to thirty cubic centimeters of\r\nwater. There is added carefully, and in small quantities, some nitric\r\nacid of 36° Baumé until all effervescence has ceased, the mass meanwhile\r\nbeing thoroughly stirred. When the carbonates have been decomposed,\r\nwhich can be told by the cessation of the effervescence, twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters more of the same acid are added. The dish is heated on the\r\nsand-bath for five hours, regulating the heating in such a way that\r\nthere still remains some acid at the end of the operation and the mass\r\nis not thoroughly dry. The acid mass is then taken up with hot water,\r\nfiltered, and washed with hot water until the amount of filtrate is\r\nabout 300 cubic centimeters. The filtrate should be received in a flask\r\nof about one liter capacity. The filtrate will contain the dissolved\r\npotash, soda, magnesia, lime, iron and aluminum oxids, and traces of\r\nsulfuric and phosphoric acids. For the elimination of the other\r\nsubstances, with the exception of potash, soda and magnesia, a few drops\r\nof barium nitrate are added, afterwards sufficient ammonia to render the\r\nsolution alkaline, and finally an excess of ammonium carbonate in powder\r\nadded in small portions. These materials are added successively and the\r\nwhole is left to stand for twenty-four hours. By this operation the\r\nsulfuric acid is separated in the form of barium sulfate; the iron and\r\naluminum oxids are precipitated, carrying down with them the phosphoric\r\nacid, and the lime is thrown down in the form of carbonate. The mass is\r\nnow filtered and washed several times with hot water. The filtrate\r\ncontains in addition to potash, soda, magnesia, and the ammoniacal salts\r\nwhich have been introduced. The ammonium salts are destroyed by adding\r\naqua regia and evaporating the liquid to a very small volume, as\r\ndescribed in the method for the estimation of magnesia. The mass is now\r\nevaporated in a porcelain dish with a flat bottom, of about seven\r\ncentimeters diameter, and an excess of perchloric acid added. The\r\nevaporation is carried to dryness on a sand-bath, and the heating\r\nprolonged until the last white fumes of perchloric acid are disengaged.\r\nThe mass is now left to cool. There are then added five cubic\r\ncentimeters of alcohol, of 90° strength. The mass is triturated by a\r\nstirring rod, the extremity of which is flattened, in such a manner as\r\nto reduce it all to an impalpable powder. It is then left to settle and\r\nthe supernatant liquid is decanted upon a small filter. The treatment\r\nwith alcohol of the kind, quantity, and strength described, is continued\r\nfour or five times. Afterwards, as there may still remain a trace of the\r\nsodium and magnesium perchlorates in the interior of the crystals of\r\npotassium perchlorate, there are added to the capsule in which all of\r\nthe alkaline residue has been collected, two or three cubic centimeters\r\nof water, and it is evaporated again to dryness and taken up twice with\r\nsmall quantities of alcohol. There are thus removed the traces of sodium\r\nand magnesium perchlorates. By means of a jet of boiling water the\r\nstirring rod and the filter, which contains the small quantities of\r\npotassium perchlorate, are washed, and the liquid passing through is\r\nreceived in the capsule which contains the larger part of the salt. It\r\nis then evaporated to dryness and weighed.\r\n\r\nWhen there is very little magnesia present, as is generally the case,\r\nthe estimation of the potash is made without any difficulty by the\r\nprocess just mentioned, but when the proportion of magnesia is high it\r\nis found useful to separate it before the transformation into\r\nperchlorates. The magnesia is separated by carbonating the residue as\r\nindicated in the method for the estimation of magnesia, by treatment\r\nwith oxalic acid and ignition. By extracting the carbonates formed with\r\nvery small quantities of water, and filtering, the alkalies are obtained\r\nfree from magnesia.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to test the purity of the potassium perchlorate formed\r\nwhich sometimes contains a little silica. For this purpose it is\r\ndissolved in boiling water, and any residue which remains is weighed,\r\nand that weight deducted from the total weight of perchlorate. By\r\nmultiplying the weight of potassium perchlorate found by the coefficient\r\n0.339, the quantity of potash contained in the twenty grams of earth\r\nsubmitted to analysis is obtained.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Potash Soluble in Cold, Dilute Acids._—(Method of\r\nSchloesing.) Introduce 100 grams of the soil into a one or one and a\r\nhalf liter flask with 600 to 800 cubic centimeters of water. A little\r\nnitric acid, of 30° Baumé, is added until the carbonate is decomposed\r\nand a slight acid reaction is obtained. Afterwards five cubic\r\ncentimeters of the same acid are added and it is left to digest for six\r\nhours, shaking every fifteen minutes. Instead of taking the whole of the\r\nwash-water for the examination, it is better to extract only a portion\r\nof it and so dispense with washing. This process is conducted in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\nThe weight P of the full flask having been determined, as much as\r\npossible of the solution, is decanted by means of a very small siphon,\r\nof which the flow is moderated by fixing a rubber tube with a pinch-cock\r\nto its lower extremity. After the decantation is complete, the flask is\r\nagain weighed, giving the weight of P′; the weight of liquid taken,\r\ntherefore, is equal to P − P′. To determine the total weight of the\r\nliquid, throw upon a filter the earthy residue insoluble in the acid,\r\nand after washing and drying it determine its weight _r_. The weight of\r\nthe empty dry flask _p_ is also determined. The total weight of the soil\r\nwill be, therefore, P − _r_ − _p_. The part of the liquid which was\r\nextracted from the flask, and upon which the analytical operation is to\r\nbe conducted is represented by the fraction (P − P′)/(P − _r_ − _p_).\r\nThis method avoids washing and evaporation which would be of very long\r\nduration. It rests upon the supposition that the solid matter from which\r\nthe liquor is separated has no affinity for the dissolved substances,\r\nand that the total of these substances has passed into the liquor, and\r\nthat the solution is homogeneous.\r\n\r\nIn the liquor first decanted as described before, the potash is\r\nestimated. This liquor contains in addition to potash, soda, lime,\r\nmagnesia, iron and aluminum oxids, as well as phosphoric, sulfuric, and\r\nhydrochloric acids. There is first added to it a little barium chlorid\r\nto precipitate the sulfuric acid. It is then heated to about 40° in a\r\nglass flask and some ammonium carbonate added in a solution containing\r\nan excess of ammonium hydroxid. By this process the lime and baryta are\r\nprecipitated in the form of carbonates; the alumina and iron as oxids,\r\nand the phosphoric acid in combination with the last two bases. The\r\nmagnesium carbonate is not precipitated because it is soluble in the\r\nammonium carbonate with which it forms a double salt.\r\n\r\nThe employment of a gentle heat favors the formation of the precipitate\r\nof calcium carbonate in a granular form which lends itself easily to\r\nfiltration. The contents of the flask are now thrown upon a filter and\r\nthe insoluble residue washed. The filtrate contains the potash, soda,\r\nmagnesia, ammonia, and nitric and hydrochloric acids. It is concentrated\r\nas rapidly as possible by heating in a flask, and afterwards the\r\nammoniacal salts are destroyed by weak aqua regia and the whole is then\r\ntransferred to a porcelain dish and evaporated to dryness. There is thus\r\nobtained a mixture of potassium, sodium, and magnesium nitrates, from\r\nwhich the potash is separated by means of perchloric acid in the manner\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Total Potash._—Beside the potash which can be\r\ndissolved by the boiling concentrated acids the soil contains potash\r\ncombined with silicates, which becomes useful for plant life with\r\nextreme slowness. It is often of great interest to estimate the total\r\npotash contained in a soil, that is to say, the reserve for the future.\r\nIn this case it is necessary to free entirely this base from its\r\ncombinations by means of hydrofluoric acid. The operation is conducted\r\nupon two grams of earth previously ignited and reduced to an impalpable\r\npowder. The decomposition is conducted in a platinum capsule by\r\nsprinkling the sample with a few cubic centimeters of hydrofluoric acid,\r\nor solution of ammonium fluorid, and adding a few drops of sulfuric\r\nacid. It is then evaporated to dryness and dissolved in boiling\r\nhydrochloric acid. The part which remains insoluble is treated a second\r\ntime by hydrofluoric and sulfuric and afterwards by hydrochloric acid.\r\nAll of the potash is thus brought into solution. The estimation of the\r\npotash, after having obtained it in a soluble state, is conducted in the\r\nmanner previously described.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Potash as Platinochlorid._—Instead of estimating the\r\npotash as perchlorate it can also be transformed into platinochlorid.\r\nThis process gives as good results as the preceding one but it is\r\nnecessary in all cases, to separate the magnesia. After having treated\r\nthe soil as indicated in the case of the estimation of the potash as\r\nperchlorate, the separation of the sulfuric and phosphoric acids, of\r\nalumina and iron, of magnesia, and the destruction of the ammoniacal\r\nsalts in the manner already described, there are finally left the\r\nalkalies potash and soda in the form of carbonates. These are\r\ntransformed into chlorids by adding hydrochloric acid; afterwards they\r\nare evaporated to dryness and the mixture of the two chlorids weighed in\r\norder to determine what quantity of platinum chlorid it is necessary to\r\nadd, in order that it be in excess. The quantity of chlorid to be added\r\nis calculated so as to be in sufficient quantity to saturate the whole\r\nof the chlorids weighed, whether they may be composed wholly of sodium\r\nor potassium. In this way there is a certainty of having an excess of\r\nplatinum. The solution of platinum chlorid used should contain in 100\r\ncubic centimeters seventeen grams of platinum. Each cubic centimeter of\r\nthis solution will be sufficient for a decigram of the sodium and\r\npotassium double chlorids. After the addition of the platinum chlorid\r\nthe mixture is evaporated in a capsule with a flat bottom, on a\r\nwater-bath. It is important that the temperature should not exceed 100°.\r\nIf the temperature should go above this there would be a tendency to\r\nform some platinum subchlorids insoluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation is continued until the contents of the dish are in a\r\npasty condition and form a rather solid mass on cooling. It is necessary\r\nto avoid a complete desiccation. After cooling, the residue is taken up\r\nby alcohol of 95° strength. It is allowed to digest with alcohol of this\r\nstrength for some time, after having been thoroughly mixed and shaken\r\ntherewith in order to obtain a complete precipitation of the\r\nplatinochlorid. This digestion should take place under a small bell-jar\r\nresting upon a piece of ground glass. The evaporation of the alcohol is\r\nthus prevented. The mass is then washed by means of alcohol of the same\r\nstrength and the liquors decanted upon a small filter placed within\r\nanother filter of identical weight, which serves as a tare for it on the\r\nbalance. The washing is prolonged until the filtrate becomes colorless.\r\nAll of the particles in the dish should be brought upon the filter by\r\nmeans of a hair-brush. The filters are now dried at a temperature not\r\nexceeding 95° and the platinochlorid received upon the interior filter\r\nis weighed. The precipitate may also be washed from the small filter\r\ninto the capsule in which it was formed by means of a jet of alcohol.\r\nThe alcohol is evaporated and the precipitate weighed in the capsule.\r\nThe weighing should be made rapidly on account of the hygroscopicity of\r\nthe material. The weight obtained multiplied by 0.193 gives the\r\ncorresponding quantity of potash in the soil.\r\n\r\n_Purification of the Oxalic Acid._—The commercial oxalic acid used in\r\nseparating the magnesia, often contains lime, magnesia, and potash. When\r\nthis reagent is used in a sufficiently large quantity in the estimation\r\nof the above substances, it is indispensable to free it entirely from\r\nthem. This is secured by submitting the oxalic acid to successive\r\nrecrystallizations which are obtained by dissolving it in warm water,\r\nfiltering and leaving to cool. The mother waters are thrown away. After\r\ntwo or three successive crystallizations the traces of potash and\r\nmagnesia have disappeared and the oxalic acid obtained after ignition\r\nleaves no trace of residue.\r\n\r\nThe purification may also be secured in the following manner: At a\r\ntemperature of 60° a saturated solution of oxalic acid is made; the\r\nliquid is decanted, carried to the boiling point and filtered. Five per\r\ncent of nitric acid are added and it is allowed to cool. The crystals\r\nwhich are deposited are collected upon a funnel in which a plug of\r\ncotton has been placed, and are washed with a little cold water.\r\n\r\n_Purity of the Ammonium Carbonate._—The ammonium carbonate employed\r\nshould not leave any residue whatever after volatilization. In general,\r\nit may be said of all the reagents employed in analyses and especially\r\nof those employed in large quantities, that it is indispensable to be\r\nsure that they contain no traces of the substances which are to be\r\nestimated. The acids, ammonia, etc., should always be examined with this\r\npoint in view.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Soda._—It is often of interest to estimate the soda\r\nin the soil, not that it is an element of any great fertility but rather\r\nbecause it is hurtful when in excess. It is determined in the residue\r\nobtained in the estimation of potash and is estimated by difference. The\r\nweight of the mixture of sodium and potassium chlorids being known when\r\nthe potash is determined, the weight of its chlorid is to be deducted\r\nfrom the weight of the two chlorids and thus the direct weight of the\r\nsodium chlorid is obtained.\r\n\r\nA better way is to make a direct estimation. The soda is found entirely\r\ndissolved in the alcoholic solution obtained by washing the potash salt\r\nas before described, for the separation of the potassium platinochlorid.\r\nThis alcoholic liquor is evaporated to dryness on a water-bath, in a\r\nbohemian flask of about 100 cubic centimeters capacity. The residue\r\nobtained consists of sodium platinochlorid and a little platinum\r\nchlorid. There is now fitted to the bohemian flask a cork stopper\r\ncarrying two tubes. The apparatus is placed upon a water-bath and kept\r\nat about 100°. Through the tube which reaches to the bottom of the\r\nbohemian flask, a current of pure hydrogen is passed. The hydrogen\r\npasses off through the second tube. The hydrogen completely reduces the\r\nsalts of platinum. In order that the decomposition may go on more\r\nrapidly a few drops of water are added. When the whole mass in the flask\r\nhas become black owing to the separation of the platinum, it is shaken,\r\nevaporated to dryness and hydrogen passed through a second time. This\r\noperation is repeated three or four times, being stopped when the water\r\nno longer shows a yellow color. There is then in the flask only a\r\nmixture of reduced platinum and sodium chlorid. No trace of sodium\r\nchlorid has been lost because the temperature has never exceeded 100°.\r\nThe sodium chlorid is dissolved by washing with water and filtered. The\r\nliquor, which must be absolutely colorless, is evaporated to dryness in\r\na platinum capsule and weighed. There is thus obtained the weight of the\r\nsodium chlorid. For verification, the sum of the weight of potassium\r\nchlorid calculated from the platinochlorid and the weight of the sodium\r\nchlorid should be equal to the initial weight of the mixture of the two\r\nchlorids.\r\n\r\n=351. Potash Methods of the German Experiment Stations.=[225]—_a._ To\r\none volume of air-dried fine earth which is obtained by sifting through\r\na three millimeter sieve, two volumes of twenty-five per cent\r\nhydrochloric acid are added, or more if the soil contains much\r\ncarbonate. The acid is allowed to act with frequent stirring for\r\nforty-eight hours at room temperature.\r\n\r\n_b._ To one volume of the soil, as above prepared, are added two volumes\r\nof hydrochloric acid and allowed to stand for three hours with frequent\r\nshaking, at the temperature of boiling water.\r\n\r\n_c._ (Halle method.) One hundred grams of the fine earth are treated\r\nwith 500 cubic centimeters of forty per cent hydrochloric acid, made up\r\nto one liter with water and allowed to stand for forty-eight hours with\r\nfrequent shaking. After filtering, a large aliquot part of the filtrate\r\nis evaporated for the estimation of the potash. The evaporated residue\r\nis washed into a half-liter flask in which the sulfuric acid is\r\nprecipitated with barium hydroxid the flask filled to the mark and an\r\naliquot part of the filtrate in a half-liter flask, treated with\r\nammonium carbonate, filtered and the potash estimated as platinochlorid\r\nby the usual method.\r\n\r\n=352. Method of Raulin for the Estimation of Potash in Soils.=[226]—The\r\nprocess rests upon the very feeble solubility in aqueous solution of\r\npotassium phosphomolybdate, while sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and\r\naluminum phosphomolybdates are more or less soluble. The process does\r\nnot require complicated separation and permits of the treatment of a\r\nsmall quantity of soil, since the weight of the phosphomolybdate\r\nobtained is equivalent to nineteen times that of the potash.\r\n\r\nThe reagent is prepared by dissolving 100 grams of crystallized ammonium\r\nmolybdate in as little water as possible and adding six and a half grams\r\nof neutral crystallized ammonium phosphate dissolved in a little water.\r\nAqua regia is now added cold and some ammonium phosphomolybdate is\r\nprecipitated. The mixture is heated, adding a little aqua regia from\r\ntime to time, until the solution of the precipitate is accomplished. The\r\nwhole is then evaporated to dryness, the final temperature of\r\nevaporation not being carried above 70°. Four hundred cubic centimeters\r\nof water are now added and five cubic centimeters of nitric acid, and\r\nthe contents of the dish heated and filtered. The reagent is then ready\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nThe liquid to be used for washing the potassium phosphomolybdate is\r\nprepared by dissolving twenty grams of sodium nitrate in one liter of\r\nwater, two cubic centimeters of pure nitric acid, and a mixture of about\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of the phosphomolybdic reagent and one and a\r\nhalf cubic centimeters of a solution of potassium nitrate containing\r\neighty grams per liter, slightly heated in order to saturate the liquid\r\nwith potassium phosphomolybdate. The solution is shaken, allowed to\r\nrest, and the liquid decanted.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of the solution in which the potash is to be\r\nestimated, a sample of soil is carefully weighed of such magnitude as to\r\ncontain about fifteen milligrams of anhydrous potash. The potash salts\r\nare dissolved by the usual processes and are separated from the largest\r\npart of the calcium, iron, and aluminum salts, and converted into\r\nnitrates. The solution is reduced to a volume of a few cubic centimeters\r\nand slightly acidulated with nitric acid. Four cubic centimeters of the\r\nphosphomolybdic reagent are added for every ten milligrams of anhydrous\r\npotash supposed to be present. The solution is evaporated to dryness at\r\n50° and immediately brought upon very small weighed filters, of which\r\neach one is double, by using sixty cubic centimeters of the washing\r\nliquor mentioned above. The tared filter is likewise washed with the\r\nsame liquid at 50° and weighed. The weight multiplied by 0.052 gives the\r\nanhydrous potash. This method for a direct precipitation of the potash\r\nsalts does not have the merits of the perchlorate process and both are\r\ninferior in accuracy to the usual platinochlorid procedure.\r\n\r\n=353. Russian Method for Estimating Potash in Soils.=[227]—Ten grams of\r\nthe soil are digested with 100 cubic centimeters of ten per cent\r\nhydrochloric acid on a steam-bath for twenty-four hours. After adding\r\nfive cubic centimeters of nitric acid to the filtrate it is evaporated\r\nto dryness, taken up with dilute hydrochloric acid, filtered, the\r\nfiltrate saturated with ammonia, the excess of ammonia driven off, again\r\nfiltered, and the lime separated by ammonium oxalate.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate is treated with a little barium chlorid for the removal of\r\nsulfuric acid and afterwards with ammonium carbonate in excess, and\r\ndigested for twenty-four hours. After filtering, the solution is\r\nevaporated in a platinum dish, the excess of ammonia driven off, the\r\nresidue taken up with water, filtered, treated with hydrochloric acid,\r\nevaporated to dryness, and ignited at low heat. The residue is again\r\ndissolved in water, filtered, and the potash precipitated with platinum\r\nchlorid and estimated in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=354. Potash Method of the Italian Stations.=[228]—The potash in the\r\nsoil should be determined in three forms; _viz._,\r\n\r\n1. Assimilable potash.\r\n\r\n2. Potash soluble in concentrated acid.\r\n\r\n3. Total potash.\r\n\r\nFor determination of the first, 100 grams of earth are put into a retort\r\nholding a liter and digested with dilute nitric acid.\r\n\r\nFor the analysis, an aliquot portion of the clear liquid is taken or\r\nweighed, and the determination of the potash is made by the common\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nFor an alternate method, from twenty to fifty grams of earth are put\r\ninto a retort of 500 cubic centimeters, moistened with water, and nitric\r\nacid is gradually added. After one or two hours there are added from 200\r\nto 300 cubic centimeters of water; the liquid is poured without\r\nfiltering into a retort and the residue washed by decantation.\r\n\r\nIn the liquid, after the elimination of the other substances with barium\r\nchlorid, ammonium carbonate, etc., the potash is determined by the\r\nordinary methods.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, by using warm concentrated acids, a portion of the\r\ninsoluble silica is decomposed, but this decomposition is always partial\r\nand the quantity of the potash extracted depends upon the temperature,\r\nupon the concentration, upon the duration of the action, and upon the\r\nnature of the acid.\r\n\r\nThe method of moistening twenty to fifty grams of earth with water and\r\nadding, thereto, concentrated nitric acid of 1.20 density, in such a\r\nmanner that the earth shall be completely saturated, may also be\r\nemployed. Then the temperature is kept at 100° during two hours. In the\r\nsolution, the potash is determined as usual.\r\n\r\nIn the third case the soil is to be decomposed by hydrofluoric and\r\nsulfuric acids, or by fusion with alkaline carbonates, and the total\r\npotash determined by one of the standard methods.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to adopt a general method for the determination of the\r\npotash the following points must be carefully considered:\r\n\r\n1. The quantity of the earth to be examined.\r\n\r\n2. The state of humidity or dryness of the same.\r\n\r\n3. The quantity, nature, and concentration of the acid.\r\n\r\n4. The quantity of the water.\r\n\r\n5. The duration of the treatment.\r\n\r\n=355. Method of J. Lawrence Smith for Potash.=—This method, designed\r\nespecially for mineral analysis, has been fully approved by the general\r\nexperience of analysts.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the method[229] depends upon the decomposition of\r\nsilicates on ignition with calcium carbonate and ammonium chlorid. The\r\nobject of this mixture is to bring into contact with the mineral,\r\ncaustic lime in a nascent state at a red heat, the caustic lime being\r\nsoluble to some extent in calcium chlorid at a high temperature. Pure\r\ncalcium carbonate, made by precipitation of marble, should be used.\r\n\r\nThe ammonium chlorid should be prepared by taking crystals of pure,\r\nsublimed sal ammoniac, dissolving in water, and filtering, and\r\nevaporating the solution until small crystals are deposited, the\r\nsolution being well-stirred until one-half or two-thirds of the whole\r\nhas crystallized. The mother-liquor is poured off while still hot, and\r\nthe crystals dried on an asbestos filter at ordinary room temperature.\r\n\r\nA special platinum crucible should be used in the Smith method, but the\r\ncommon crucible, especially if very deep, can be employed. The special\r\ncrucible is of about double the usual length. Smith recommends a\r\ncrucible ninety-five millimeters in length, diameter at top twenty-two\r\nmillimeters, at bottom sixteen millimeters, and weighing thirty-five to\r\nforty grams. The object of the long crucible is to have the part of the\r\nbottom containing the silicate subjected to a high heat, while the top\r\nof the crucible is at a much lower temperature, thus preventing the loss\r\nof alkalies by volatilization.\r\n\r\n_Method of Analysis._—The samples of soil or silicate containing the\r\nalkalies are well pulverized in an agate mortar, and from one-half to\r\none gram of the finely pulverized material taken for analysis. This is\r\ncarefully mixed with the same weight of finely powdered sal ammoniac and\r\nthe mineral and sal ammoniac rubbed well together in a mortar. Eight\r\nparts by weight of calcium carbonate are next added in three or four\r\nportions, and the whole intimately mixed after each addition. The\r\ncontents of the mortar are emptied on a piece of glazed paper and then\r\nintroduced into the crucible, which is tapped gently upon the table\r\nuntil the contents are well settled. It is then fixed in the furnace\r\nwhich is used for heating, and a small bunsen burner is placed beneath\r\nthe crucible, and the heat applied just about at the top of the mixture\r\nand gradually carried toward the lower part until the sal ammoniac is\r\ncompletely decomposed, which requires from four to five minutes. The\r\nheat is then applied by means of a blast-lamp and the crucible kept at a\r\nbright red heat for from forty to sixty minutes. The crucible is allowed\r\nto cool, the contents detached and placed in a platinum or porcelain\r\ndish of about 150 cubic centimeters capacity, and sixty to eighty cubic\r\ncentimeters of distilled water added. The solution of the flux may be\r\nhastened by heating the water to the boiling point. The crucible and its\r\ncover are also well washed with hot water until all matter adhering to\r\nthem is dissolved. After the slaking of the mass it is best to continue\r\nthe digestion with hot water for six or eight hours, although this is\r\nnot absolutely necessary. The contents of the crucible are filtered and\r\nwashed well with about 200 cubic centimeters of water. The filtrate\r\ncontains in solution all the alkalies of the mineral, or soil, together\r\nwith calcium chlorid and caustic lime. A solution of pure ammonium\r\ncarbonate containing about one and one-half grams of the pure salt is\r\nadded to the filtrate. This precipitates the lime as carbonate. The dish\r\ncontaining the material is placed on a water-bath and its contents\r\nevaporated to about forty cubic centimeters. Two additional drops of\r\nammonium carbonate are added, and a few drops of caustic ammonia, to\r\nprecipitate any lime which may be redissolved by the action of the\r\nammonium chlorid solution on the calcium carbonate. Filter on a small\r\nfilter and wash with as little water as possible and collect the\r\nfiltrate in a small beaker. The filtrate contains all the alkalies as\r\nchlorids, together with a little ammonium chlorid. Add a drop of\r\nammonium carbonate solution to be sure all the lime is precipitated,\r\nevaporate on a water-bath in a deep platinum dish, in which the alkalies\r\nare to be weighed. The dish should have from thirty to sixty cubic\r\ncentimeters capacity, and during the evaporation should never be more\r\nthan two-thirds filled. After the evaporation has been completed the\r\ndish is slowly heated and then gently ignited over a gas-flame to drive\r\noff any ammonium chlorid which may be present. During this process the\r\nplatinum dish may be covered with a thin piece of platinum to prevent\r\nany possible loss by the spitting of the salt after the ammonium chlorid\r\nhas been driven off. The heat should be gradually increased until it is\r\nbrought to a point a little below redness, leaving the cover off. The\r\nplatinum dish is again covered, and when sufficiently cooled placed on a\r\nbalance and weighed.\r\n\r\nIf lithium chlorid be present it is necessary to weigh it quickly as the\r\nsalt being very deliquescent takes up moisture rapidly. The alkalies may\r\nnow be separated in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIf the sample under examination contains magnesia the residue in the\r\ncapsule should be dissolved in a little water and sufficient pure\r\nlime-water added to render the solution alkaline. It should then be\r\nboiled and filtered. The magnesia will, in this way, be completely\r\nseparated from the alkalies. The solution which has passed through the\r\nfilter is treated with ammonium carbonate in the manner first described,\r\nand the process continued and completed as above mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf it be suspected that the whole of the alkalies have not been obtained\r\nby the first fusion, the residue upon the filter can be rubbed up in a\r\nmortar with an amount of ammonium chlorid equal to one-half the weight\r\nof the mineral, mixed with fresh portions of calcium carbonate and\r\ntreated exactly as in the first instance. Any trace of alkali remaining\r\nfrom the first fusion is thus recovered in the second one.\r\n\r\n_Method of Heating the Crucible._—The apparatus used by Smith for\r\nigniting the crucible is shown in Fig. 67. It consists of an iron\r\nfilter-stand HG, a clamp, ED, carrying the muffle NC, attached by the\r\nsupports AB, and heated by the lamp F. The muffle NC is a chimney of\r\nsheet iron, eight to nine centimeters long, ten centimeters high, the\r\nwidth at the bottom being about four centimeters on one side and three\r\ncentimeters on the other. It is made with the sides straight for about\r\nfour centimeters and then inclining toward the top so as to leave the\r\nopening at the top about one centimeter in width. A piece is cut out of\r\nthe front of the chimney of the width of the diameter of the hole in the\r\niron support and about four centimeters in length, being semi-circular\r\nat the top, fitting over the platinum crucible. Just above this part of\r\nthe chimney, is riveted a piece of sheet iron in the form of a flattened\r\nhook, N, which holds the chimney in place by being slipped over the top\r\nof the crucible support; it serves as a protection to the crucible\r\nagainst the cooling effects of the currents of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 67.\r\n\r\n  SMITH’S MUFFLE FOR DECOMPOSITION OF SILICATES.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=356. International Method for Assimilable and Total Potash.=—In the\r\nInternational Congress of Chemists held in Paris in 1889,[230] the\r\ndiscrimination between the assimilable and total potash was declared to\r\nbe of prime importance. Unfortunately no method is known by which the\r\npotash which is present in the soil in a state suited to the wants of\r\nplants can be determined with approximate accuracy. In general, that\r\nportion which is given up to weak acids may be assumed to be available.\r\nIn the treatment of soils with weak acid, as pointed out in the\r\nCongress, it is demonstrable that with a 0.05 to 0.1 per cent nitric\r\nacid solution, the quantity of potash which goes into solution increases\r\nby continued stirring of the mixture with the time of action of the acid\r\nup to a certain maximum which is reached in from three to four hours,\r\nand after that, it is not changed even when the strength of the acid\r\nmixture is increased to two per cent. From this time on, concentrated\r\nacids withdraw from the soil which has already been exhausted by the\r\nweak acid, a new quantity of potash. The soils which have been exhausted\r\nby concentrated acids yield also an additional quantity of potash when\r\nthey are treated with hydrofluoric acid, or melted with barium or sodium\r\ncarbonate. Potash, therefore, appears to exist in the soil in various\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nFirst. In the form of indecomposable silicates which have,\r\nagriculturally perhaps, very little interest.\r\n\r\nSecond. In the form of silicates which are more basic than those just\r\nmentioned. These silicates are attacked by strong acids and give up\r\nprobably every year a portion of their potash to vegetation.\r\n\r\nThird. In a form which is easily soluble in weak acids and consequently\r\ndirectly assimilable by plants.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that it would be of interest to chemists and\r\nagronomists to establish certain methods of investigation so as to be\r\nable to obtain comparative results, it was decided to adopt the original\r\nmethod recommended by Gasparin for the estimation of the potash\r\ndecomposable by concentrated acids. This method consists in the\r\ntreatment of the soil with boiling aqua regia until the sand which is\r\nnot decomposed, is white.\r\n\r\n_Determination of the Fineness of the Earth which is Used for\r\nAnalysis._—For the estimation of potash, the soil should be divided as\r\nfinely as possible, and passed through a sieve of thirty meshes to the\r\ncentimeter. The decomposition is then completed in two hours, while if a\r\nsieve of only ten perforations per centimeter is used, the acid must be\r\nallowed to work for twelve hours.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the potash after solution, is accomplished by any\r\nof the standard methods.\r\n\r\n=357. Method of Tatlock as Used by Dyer.=—Attention was called in\r\nparagraph =328= to the estimation of the total plant food in the soil by\r\nextraction of the sample with citric acid. Dyer first determines the\r\ntotal potash by Tatlock’s method which is as follows:\r\n\r\nTo determine potash ten grams of fine dry soil are treated with ten\r\ncubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid and evaporated to dryness on the\r\nwater-bath, the residue taken up with another ten cubic centimeters of\r\nacid, warmed, diluted with water, boiled, filtered, and washed. The\r\nfiltrate and washings are concentrated and gently incinerated to get rid\r\nof organic matter, and the residue redissolved in hydrochloric acid, and\r\nevaporated slowly with a considerable quantity of platinum chlorid. If\r\nthe evaporation be conducted slowly, the potassium platinochlorid\r\nsettles out well, despite the iron, aluminum, and calcium salts, and is\r\neasily washed with some more platinum chlorid solution, followed by\r\nalcohol. The application of this modification of the platinum chlorid\r\nprocess to solutions containing comparatively minute quantities of\r\npotash amid an overwhelming excess of iron, aluminum, and calcium salts\r\nis probably new to many chemists. It works admirably, and obviates the\r\nnecessity for removing iron, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, etc., with\r\nthe necessary use of ammonia, and the tedious processes of concentration\r\nand final volatilization of the ammonium salts; but, of course, the\r\nprocess cannot be employed if soda also is to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe potash, soluble in hydrochloric acid, having been thus determined,\r\nthe undissolved siliceous matter is incinerated, weighed, and finely\r\nground in an agate mortar. A weighed portion of it is then, as in the\r\nSmith method, mixed with a large bulk of pure calcium carbonate and a\r\nlittle ammonium chlorid and heated, beginning with a low temperature,\r\nrising slowly to bright redness. The mass is then boiled with water,\r\nwashed, incinerated, reground, mixed with some more ammonium chlorid,\r\nand again heated, boiled, and washed. The process is repeated and the\r\nfiltrates from all the treatments concentrated, the calcium being\r\nremoved as carbonate, and the potash determined in the filtrate, after\r\nevaporation and incineration at a low temperature, by means of platinum\r\nchlorid.\r\n\r\nFive hundred cubic centimeters of the citric acid solution of the soil,\r\nmade as described in paragraph =328=, corresponding to fifty grams of\r\nsoil, are evaporated to dryness in a platinum dish and ignited at a low\r\ntemperature. The residue is dissolved in hydrochloric acid filtered and\r\nwashed, and the filtrate again evaporated to dryness and treated again\r\nas just described. The potash is then determined as above.\r\n\r\n=358. Estimation of Total Alkalies and Alkaline Earths.=—To properly\r\ndetermine the exact amount of these substances in a sample of soil it is\r\nnecessary first to remove the silica. This is accomplished in the\r\nprocess of Berthelot and André[231] by intimately incorporating with the\r\nsample, in a state of very fine powder, four or five times its weight of\r\nammonium fluorid. The mixture, in a platinum dish, is moistened with\r\nstrong sulfuric acid and allowed to stand for a few hours. It is then\r\ngently heated until all fumes of hydrofluosilicic acid have disappeared,\r\nbut the mass is not raised to a red heat. If there is any doubt about\r\nthe complete decomposition of the silica the treatment is repeated.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the operation there remain only sulfates without excess of\r\nsulfuric acid. The sulfates likely to be present are of potash, soda,\r\nlime, magnesia, alumina, and iron. The separation of these bodies is\r\nconducted in the ordinary manner.\r\n\r\nFusing the soil with potash does not give reliable results but it can be\r\nused in certain cases for the rapid estimation of alumina and iron. In\r\nthis case after the separation of the silica in the ordinary way the\r\niron can be determined as ferric oxid.\r\n\r\nThe iron can also be directly determined by reducing to the ferrous\r\nstate and titrating with potassium permanganate.\r\n\r\n_Comparison of Fluorin Method with Common Methods._—To establish the\r\ndifference in the data obtained by the old and new processes samples of\r\nthe same earth were treated by Berthelot and André by different methods\r\nwith the following results:\r\n\r\n                 By the      By the cold     By the          By\r\n                 fluorin       dilute     concentrated  incineration\r\n                 method.    hydrochloric  hydrochloric       and\r\n                            acid method.  acid method.   subsequent\r\n                                                          treatment\r\n                                                        with boiling\r\n                                                        hydrochloric\r\n                                                        acid method.\r\n\r\n                  Per cent.

Boiling sulfuric acid might do a little better but would\r\nnot give correct results. Lime alone of the elements in the soil can be\r\ncorrectly determined by solution in boiling hydrochloric acid, a\r\ncircumstance due to the fact that lime is found chiefly as carbonate,\r\nsulfate, and phosphate in the soil, and these compounds are easily\r\nsoluble in hot hydrochloric acid with the exception of the sulfate. Even\r\nlime could not be thus determined in soils containing silicates rich in\r\nlime. The other mineral elements cannot be determined by the wet method.\r\nThis is due to the forms in which they occur, being mostly silicates of\r\ndifferent composition, with excess of silica.\r\n\r\nAs to the silicates they may be divided into two groups. The first of\r\nthese are the hydrated silicates, resembling the zeolites, capable of\r\nbeing completely decomposed by boiling acids. The first group of\r\nsilicates is doubtless of greater importance to vegetable life than the\r\nsecond since it would, doubtless, give up its alkalies with greater\r\nease. This distinction is, however, arbitrary. It is, in fact,\r\nimpossible to place on one side the soluble and on the other the\r\ninsoluble silicates. This distinction represents only the unequal\r\ndegrees in the speed of decomposition of the different silicates\r\ncontained in the primitive rocks under the influence of atmospheric\r\nagents, the soil being nothing more than the products of the\r\ndecomposition of these rocks with vegetable mold. The second group is\r\ninsoluble in acids.\r\n\r\nThat part of the silicates least decomposed at any given moment will be\r\nattacked more easily by acids, while that portion whose decomposition\r\nhas been pushed furthest will be more slowly attacked. The action of the\r\nacid will grow more feeble as the time of contact is prolonged, and\r\nafter a time a point is apparently reached where the results are nearly\r\nconstant. But it is evident that this distinction is purely conventional\r\nand bears no necessary or even probable connection with the quantity of\r\nalkali really assimilable by plants.\r\n\r\nVegetables, moreover, exert on a soil, for the extraction of its\r\nalkalies and other matters, chemical reactions peculiar to themselves,\r\naltogether distinct from the tardy action of atmospheric agents and\r\nstill more distinct from the rapid action of mineral acids.\r\n\r\nIt is well known with what energy, it ought to be said with what\r\nadmirable instinct, plants take from the soil the least traces of\r\nphosphorus, of sulfur, of potash, of iron, and other substances\r\nnecessary to their sustenance.\r\n\r\nThese specific actions of vegetables on the soil merit, in the highest\r\ndegree, the attention of analysts and agronomists. Their intervention\r\nplays a most important part in the restitution to the soil, by means of\r\ncomplementary fertilizers, the mineral elements removed by vegetable\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n=359. Estimation of Lime by the French Method.=—The quantity of lime\r\ncontained in the soil varies within wide limits. Sometimes this base is\r\nentirely absent to such a degree that it is even impossible to discover\r\nfeeble traces of it. Sometimes it composes almost the whole of the\r\nearthy mass. Lime is found in the soil principally in the state of\r\ncarbonate. It is also found combined with organic matter under the form\r\nof humates, with sulfuric acid, etc. It is customary to estimate the\r\nlime as a whole, without distinguishing between the different states in\r\nwhich it exists. The quantity of material which is used in the French\r\nmethod[232] varies in proportion to the amount of calcareous matter\r\ncontained in it. For a soil which contains a large amount of lime, one\r\nor two grams would be sufficient for the analysis. For a soil which is\r\npoor in calcareous matter ten or even twenty grams must be taken. The\r\nquantity of lime dissolved differs according to the strength of the\r\nacids employed and length of contact of the acid with the soil. The\r\ncalcium carbonate, the sulfate, the nitrate, and the humate rapidly pass\r\ninto solution when treated with acid as above, but this is not the case\r\nwith calcium silicates which are attacked much more slowly. Sometimes\r\nthe silicates give only an insignificant increase in the amount of lime,\r\nand in this case it is immaterial what process of solution is employed.\r\nFor simplicity it is best to adopt the method of solution in boiling\r\nconcentrated nitric acid, prolonging the boiling for a period of five\r\nhours. This method of operation is sufficient to bring into solution at\r\none treatment, not only the lime, but also the potash and magnesia.\r\nAfter having heated with acid for the necessary time there are added in\r\nthe capsule in which the solution took place ten cubic centimeters of\r\nnitric acid and fifty cubic centimeters of water. The mixture is heated,\r\ncollected upon a filter and the residue washed. To the filtrate, the\r\nvolume of which should be from 400 to 500 cubic centimeters, a\r\nsufficient quantity of ammonia is added to render it slightly alkaline.\r\nThere is formed a precipitate of alumina and of iron oxid containing\r\nphosphoric acid and also sometimes a trace of the lime combined with the\r\nsame acid. In order to keep the whole of the lime in solution it is\r\nnecessary to add a little acetic acid, about ten cubic centimeters more\r\nthan is necessary to neutralize the ammonia which has been added in\r\nexcess. If the liquid is turbid on account of the presence of the iron\r\nand aluminum phosphates it is necessary to filter it. There is\r\nafterwards added a slight excess of ammonium oxalate in solution, and\r\nthe whole is left for twenty-four hours in order that the calcium\r\noxalate may deposit. Indeed, the complete precipitation is not always\r\nimmediate, and especially in the presence of magnesia it takes place\r\nwith slowness. The calcium oxalate is collected upon a filter and washed\r\nwith hot water. To determine the quantity of the lime the best procedure\r\nconsists in transforming the oxalate into carbonate by a careful\r\nignition, and afterwards heating in a Schloesing or Leclerc furnace for\r\nfour or five minutes. The oxalate for this purpose should be contained\r\nin a covered platinum crucible. By this method the calcium carbonate is\r\ntransformed into calcium oxid, in which form it is weighed rapidly to\r\navoid absorption of moisture.\r\n\r\nIn laboratories which have no means of securing so high a temperature as\r\nis mentioned before, the lime may be weighed as sulfate. For this\r\npurpose the calcium oxalate is transformed into carbonate by ignition in\r\na platinum crucible. Afterwards it is treated with nitric acid until the\r\ncarbon dioxid is completely driven off. The platinum crucible is now\r\ncovered with a funnel which is afterwards washed in order to bring back\r\ninto the dish the small drops which have been projected in the process\r\nof boiling. An excess of sulfuric acid is added and evaporated to\r\ndryness on a sand-bath. Afterwards, in a muffle, the temperature is\r\ncarried to a feeble redness until the vapors of sulfuric acid are all\r\ndriven off. The lime is weighed in the form of sulfate, and the weight\r\nmultiplied by 0.412 gives the lime contained in the quantity of earth\r\nanalyzed.\r\n\r\nIn special researches in which it is desired to avoid attacking the\r\nsiliceous pebbles of the soil, the concentrated nitric acid is replaced\r\nby dilute nitric acid in slight excess, and heated for a few moments\r\nonly. The calcium carbonate is then dissolved with the other calcareous\r\nsalts not combined with silica in the rock products. The analysis is\r\ncontinued in other respects as just described.\r\n\r\n=360. Estimation of the Actual Calcium Carbonate.=—The lime which is\r\nfound in the state of carbonate plays one of the most important rôles in\r\nthe chemical phenomena which take place in the soil. It is often of\r\ngreat importance to determine it. The most certain process is to\r\nestimate the carbon dioxid which is disengaged from the carbonate under\r\nthe influence of an acid and to receive this gas in a jar graduated to\r\nmeasure it by volume. The flask recommended by the French Commission for\r\nthis purpose contains about 300 cubic centimeters. The neck of the flask\r\nis connected with a condensing tube of about one centimeter interior\r\ndiameter, which is cooled by a current of water.\r\n\r\nAccording to the presumed richness in calcium carbonate varying\r\nquantities of earth are taken for analysis, from as little as half a\r\ngram for soils which are rich in carbonate, up to five or even ten grams\r\nfor soils which are poor in carbonate. The apparatus is connected with a\r\nmercury pump for the purpose of exhausting the air as completely as\r\npossible therefrom. For this purpose the flask in which the carbonate is\r\ndisengaged is made in the shape of a tubulated retort. Through the\r\nopening into the retort, a narrow tube is introduced and connected with\r\na small funnel by means of a rubber tube supplied with a pinch-cock.\r\nWhen the retort has been connected with the mercury pump a slight vacuum\r\nis produced and the pinch-cock is opened and forty cubic centimeters of\r\ndistilled water allowed to enter. The pinch-cock is closed soon enough\r\nto retain a portion of the water in the funnel. The retort is then\r\nheated and a vacuum partially produced by means of the pump. When the\r\nflask is boiling, the steam drives out the air. A refrigerating jacket\r\nis connected with the tube leading from the retort to the pump by means\r\nof which the steam is condensed and falls back into the flask. After\r\nsome minutes of boiling, a vacuum is produced; the lamp is then taken\r\naway and a cylinder, graduated at 100 cubic centimeters and filled with\r\nmercury, is placed over the lower orifice of the pump, and there is\r\nintroduced into the apparatus, by the funnel above described, some\r\nhydrochloric acid in small quantities, but sufficient only to saturate\r\nthe whole of the carbonate in the sample of soil taken. Usually three or\r\nfour cubic centimeters will be sufficient. The acid should be added in\r\nsuch quantities as to prevent the production of any large amount of\r\nfoam. If frothing should be excessive a little oil can be added to the\r\nflask. The whole of the carbon dioxid produced in the reaction is\r\nwithdrawn by means of the mercury pump and collected in the graduated\r\njar. Towards the end of the operation the flask is heated anew in order\r\nto produce an ebullition which is continued for some time. The volume of\r\ngas collected is measured after making the proper corrections for\r\npressure and temperature. Afterwards the carbon dioxid which has been\r\nproduced is absorbed by two or three cubic centimeters of a solution of\r\npotash of 42° baumé. This potash is introduced into the graduated jar by\r\nmeans of a pipette bent into the form of a =ᥩ= in the lower portion. If\r\nthe whole of the gas is not absorbed the volume which remains is read,\r\nand this is subtracted from the original volume after having made the\r\nproper corrections for pressure and temperature. The difference gives\r\nthe quantity of carbon dioxid contained in the amount of earth employed.\r\nFrom this the actual weight of the calcium carbonate is computed. This\r\nofficial French method does not appear to possess any advantage in\r\naccuracy to the usual absorption method and is far more complicated.\r\n\r\n=361. Estimation of the Active Calcareous Matter in Soils.=—Like other\r\nsoil elements, the calcium carbonate exists in different degrees of\r\nfineness and availability in the soil. It must be admitted that the fine\r\nparticles play the most important rôle. The calcium carbonate, which\r\nexists in large fragments, presents only a circumscribed surface and\r\nremains almost inactive, although it is easily corroded by the rootlets\r\nof plants. It is possible to estimate in a rapid way, the quantity of\r\nfine carbonate in the soil, considering that in a time relatively short,\r\nfeeble acids act upon calcareous matter proportionally to the surface\r\nwhich it presents, and that it attacks, therefore, especially the finest\r\nparticles. By measuring the amount of carbon dioxid set free under the\r\naction of dilute acids it is possible to estimate the content of\r\navailable calcareous matter in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of Mondesir is used for this purpose by the French\r\nchemists. It is composed of a tubulated flask of about 600 cubic\r\ncentimeters capacity. The interior tubulature carries a manometer fixed\r\nby means of a stopper. This is formed of a rubber tube, terminated by a\r\nglass tube, whose extremity is united to a little rubber bag, very\r\nflexible, placed in the interior of the flask.\r\n\r\n_Graduation of the Apparatus._—If the apparatus is new it is necessary\r\nto begin by graduating it. The rubber bag is filled with water, the air\r\nbeing carefully excluded, in such a way that the level of the water\r\ncomes just a little above the bend in the tube. There are placed in the\r\nflask 125 cubic centimeters of water and it is shaken for a few seconds.\r\nThe flask and the manometer are then unstoppered and the level of the\r\nwater in the manometer is made to equal the level of the water in the\r\nflask. With a rubber ring the level of the water in the manometer tube\r\nis marked. The manometer is then stoppered. There are then added to the\r\nflask two-tenths gram of pure calcium carbonate. The flask is closed and\r\nshaken for a minute. There are then added, enclosed in a little piece of\r\nfilter paper, six-tenths of a gram of pulverized tartaric acid and the\r\nflask immediately closed and shaken several times. The manometer tube is\r\nthen uncorked and moved until the level of the water reaches the point\r\nmarked before. The difference in level after the height of the water\r\nremains constant is then read. The depression in the level observed,\r\ncorresponds to two-tenths gram of pure calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\n=362. Estimation of the Available Calcareous Matter in the Soil.=—There\r\nis introduced into the flask of the apparatus a quantity of soil varying\r\nin amount in accordance with the content of carbonate which it is\r\nsupposed to contain. There are added 125 cubic centimeters of water and\r\nthe flask is shaken for a minute. As in the test given before, the level\r\nof the water in the manometer is then made to correspond to that of the\r\nwater in the flask. The level in the manometer is marked as before with\r\na rubber band, and the manometer is then closed. There are then added,\r\ncontained in a piece of filter paper, two grams of pulverized tartaric\r\nacid and the operation is finished as described before. The amount of\r\ntartaric acid added, in general, should be three times as much as the\r\namount of calcium carbonate supposed to be contained in the earth. The\r\npressure in the manometer being proportional to the quantity of carbon\r\ndioxid disengaged, it is easy to calculate the quantity of calcium\r\ncarbonate in a state of fine division contained in the soil taken for\r\nthe test.\r\n\r\nIn order to fill the rubber bag it is necessary to put it in its proper\r\nplace in the apparatus. The flask is filled with water in order to\r\nflatten the rubber bag and expel the air from it. It is then closed with\r\na cork. Afterwards, with the aid of a small funnel and with a copper\r\nwire placed in the tube, the lower extremity of which descends just to\r\nthe elbow, the air in the tube is replaced by water. The operation is\r\nfinished by uncorking the flask and inclining it or shaking it after a\r\npartial vacuum has been established. It is useless to attempt to drive\r\noff the last particles of the air. The rubber bag should have a content\r\nof about double the volume of the whole of the interior of the\r\nmanometric tube. In the washing which is necessary between two\r\nsuccessive operations, it is well to fill the flask entirely with water\r\nin order to expel all the carbon dioxid which it may contain.\r\n\r\nThe same remark may be made of this method of determination as was made\r\nof the last one. In the present case, however, the operation is not\r\nquite so complicated. When the apparatus is once arranged, it will admit\r\nof rapid determinations.\r\n\r\n=363. Lime Method at the Riga Station.=—Ten grams of the non-ignited\r\nsample of the fine earth are digested with 100 cubic centimeters of ten\r\nper cent hydrochloric acid, in a 250 cubic centimeter erlenmeyer for\r\ntwenty-four hours on the steam-bath, with frequent shaking. The\r\nfiltrate, with washings after the addition of five cubic centimeters\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid, is evaporated to dryness in a porcelain dish\r\nand the residue taken up with dilute hydrochloric acid. After filtering,\r\nammonia is added in excess, the excess removed by evaporation, and the\r\nmass is again filtered. In the filtrate, the lime is thrown down with\r\nammonium oxalate, filtered, ignited, and weighed as calcium oxid.\r\n\r\nThe above method cannot give exact results chiefly because more or less\r\nlime may be carried down with the phosphoric acid. Also if manganese be\r\npresent it will be thrown down with the lime. These errors are\r\ncompensatory, but only by chance could the compensation lead to\r\nexactness. It would be better in all cases to remove the iron and\r\nalumina in such a way as would avoid loss of time.\r\n\r\n=364. Estimation of Assimilable Lime.=—In the determination of the total\r\nlime in soils or even of that part present as carbonate, it is not to be\r\nassumed that the quantity assimilable by plants is known; particles of\r\nlime minerals in soils are corroded only superficially by the rootlets\r\nof plants and any process which would attack only the superficies of the\r\nlime particles would thus more nearly resemble the activity of the\r\nsolvent forces of plant growth. Oxalic acid is a reagent of this kind,\r\nattacking only the surfaces of lime particles. Reverdin and de la Harpe\r\nguided by this fact have based a method for determining the amount of\r\nlime present in the soil in an available state on the solvent action of\r\noxalic acid.[233] After the total lime content has been determined,\r\ntwenty grams of the soil sample are covered with 200 cubic centimeters\r\nof a solution containing in molecular proportion a known quantity of\r\nsodium oxalate and carbonate. The mixture is digested on the water-bath\r\nfor one hour. By this treatment all lime minerals are converted\r\nsuperficially into oxalate while particles containing magnesia are not\r\naffected. After filtering and washing well, the filtrate and wash-waters\r\nare acidulated with hydrochloric acid. If any precipitate of organic\r\nmatter be produced separate it by filtration. Treat the filtrate with a\r\nslight excess of sodium acetate by which process the excess of\r\nhydrochloric acid is replaced with acetic after which the oxalic acid\r\nmay be separated by treatment with calcium chlorid and subsequently\r\ntitrated with potassium permanganate in presence of excess of sulfuric\r\nacid. The oxalic acid obtained, deducted from the quantity originally\r\npresent will give the amount consumed on the surfaces of the lime\r\nparticles and consequently the amount of lime corresponding thereto\r\nwhich may be considered as available for plant growth.\r\n\r\n=365. Method of the Halle Station for Lime.=[234]—a. _In Phosphates,\r\nLimestones, etc._—Four grams of the prepared substance are heated with\r\nfifty cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid and five cubic centimeters\r\nof nitric acid, in a porcelain dish on the water-bath to dryness, and\r\nleft for a few hours at 105° for the purpose of separating the silicic\r\nacid. The dry residue is moistened with hot water and a few drops of\r\nhydrochloric acid, and allowed to stand for some time with frequent\r\nstirring. The contents of the dish are then washed into a half-liter\r\nflask, filled up to the mark and the separated silicic acid removed by\r\nfiltration. If the silicic acid is not taken into account, the solution\r\ncan be made directly in a half-liter flask.\r\n\r\nAfter filtration, an aliquot part of the filtrate is neutralized in a\r\n500 or 250 cubic centimeter flask with ammonia, again acidified with a\r\nfew drops of hydrochloric acid and allowed to stand six hours at least,\r\nin the cold, with ammonium acetate. For each four grams of the substance\r\nfifty cubic centimeters of an ammonium acetate solution are used, made\r\nby dissolving in one liter of water 100 grams of ammonium acetate. If\r\nphosphoric acid is present in excess, iron and aluminum oxids are\r\nprecipitated completely as phosphates. If iron and aluminum oxids are in\r\nexcess, the excess must be precipitated by ammonia. If it is feared that\r\nin the subsequent precipitation of the lime by ammonium oxalate there\r\nmay be still some phosphoric acid in solution, before precipitation with\r\nammonium acetate the proper amount of ferric chlorid is added and the\r\niron is afterwards precipitated with ammonia. It is certain that in the\r\npresence of oxalic acid and phosphoric acid the lime is precipitated as\r\noxalate, but should it be feared that traces of calcium phosphate are\r\nprecipitated with the iron and aluminum phosphates the precipitate of\r\niron and aluminum phosphates may be dissolved in hydrochloric acid,\r\nneutralized with ammonia, again acidified and a second time precipitated\r\nwith ammonium acetate and the filtrate added to that first obtained.\r\n\r\nFor the further estimation the filtrates are united and a quantity\r\ncorresponding to a given part of the original sample, and being in\r\nvolume from fifty to one hundred cubic centimeters is made slightly acid\r\nwith acetic acid and while hot precipitated with dilute ammonium\r\noxalate. The filtrate must contain acetic acid since calcium oxalate is\r\nbest precipitated from a slightly acetic acid solution. The filtering of\r\nthe calcium oxalate should not take place until from six to twelve hours\r\nafter precipitation, and during this time it should stand in a warm\r\nplace. Filter paper of the best quality should be used for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe dried precipitate is brought into a platinum crucible together with\r\nthe filter; the filter is first incinerated over an ordinary bunsen and\r\nthe calcium oxalate converted into calcium oxid by ignition for fifteen\r\nminutes over the blast. It is then cooled in a well-closed desiccator\r\nand weighed as oxid. If in the precipitation of the iron and aluminum\r\nphosphates sodium acetate be employed instead of ammonium acetate, the\r\nprecipitation must take place hot and filtration also be accomplished on\r\na hot filter.\r\n\r\nb. _Estimation of Lime in Soils._—For the estimation of lime in soils\r\nthere may be used either the acid soil-extract, prepared as under the\r\ndirection for the estimation of potash, or twenty grams of the soil may\r\nbe treated with hydrochloric acid and a few drops of nitric acid, and\r\nevaporated to dryness in a porcelain dish and the silicic acid separated\r\nas described for the estimation of lime in phosphates and limestones. In\r\nthe case of soils, iron and aluminum oxids can be precipitated directly\r\nwith ammonia since the small quantity of phosphoric acid usually\r\ncontained in soils is not sufficient to influence in any way the\r\nestimation of the lime. For example suppose there is 0.10 per cent of\r\nphosphoric acid contained in a soil. In case the whole of this\r\nphosphoric acid is taken down with the lime it would only amount to\r\nabout 0.10 per cent of calcium oxid precipitated as phosphate. This\r\ncase, however, is very improbable since it is much more likely that the\r\niron and aluminum phosphates will be precipitated and the whole of the\r\nphosphoric acid be carried down with them instead of being precipitated\r\nwith the lime.\r\n\r\nThe precipitation of the lime and its subsequent treatment are to be\r\nconducted as just described.\r\n\r\n=366. Estimation of the Magnesia.=—Magnesia is a much more rare element\r\nin the soil than lime. It is usually necessary to operate upon\r\nconsiderable quantities of earth in order to determine the magnesia with\r\nany degree of precision. From ten to twenty grams of the soil are taken.\r\nThe decomposition is accomplished as in the case of lime. A few drops of\r\nbarium nitrate are added for the purpose of precipitating any sulfuric\r\nacid present. Some ammonia and ammonium carbonate are added to\r\nprecipitate the iron and aluminum oxids, the lime and the excess of\r\nbarium introduced, as well as the phosphoric acid. The operation is best\r\nconducted on a dilute solution having a volume of from 400 to 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters. The solution from which the lime has been precipitated,\r\ncontains with the magnesia, large quantities of ammoniacal salts which\r\nit is necessary to destroy. For this purpose the solution is\r\nconcentrated in a flask until its volume is about ten cubic centimeters.\r\nAbout ten cubic centimeters of nitric acid are added and the whole\r\nbrought to the boiling point. Afterwards a few drops of hydrochloric\r\nacid are added. Continuing the heating, hydrochloric acid is added in\r\nsmall portions and, from time to time, some nitric acid until the\r\nbubbles indicating the setting free of gaseous nitrogen, resulting from\r\nthe action of the nascent chlorin upon the ammonia, have completely\r\nceased to appear. The whole is then evaporated on a sand-bath in a\r\nporcelain dish in order to separate the silica. The residue is taken up\r\nby water containing a few drops of nitric acid. It is filtered and\r\nevaporated to dryness in a covered porcelain dish. Upon the residue four\r\nor five grams of oxalic acid, in a state of powder, are placed. A little\r\nwater is added in such a way that the moist mass covers entirely the\r\nmatter in the dish. In order to avoid all losses there is placed upon\r\nthe dish a funnel which serves as a cover. The dish is heated on a\r\nsand-bath, but when the film which is formed begins to break there are\r\nadded from time to time, a little more oxalic acid and water until there\r\nis no longer any disengagement of the vapor of nitric acid. Afterwards\r\nit is evaporated to dryness and the heat raised to a low redness. The\r\nmagnesia is found in a free state or mixed with alkalies. It is washed\r\nwith a small quantity of water and collected upon a very small filter\r\npaper. The filter paper is dried, burned, the ignition carried to\r\nredness and afterwards cooled and weighed. In order to test the purity\r\nof the magnesia it is transformed into sulfate by the addition of a few\r\ndrops of sulfuric acid. The excess of sulfuric acid is driven off by\r\nheating moderately by means of a gas-burner moving it in a circular\r\nmanner round the bottom of the capsule and lifting the cover from time\r\nto time in order to allow the vapors of sulfuric acid to escape. The\r\nweight of the magnesium sulfate should correspond to that of the\r\nmagnesia from which it was formed.\r\n\r\nMagnesia exists most often in the soil in the state of carbonate or\r\nsilicate. In this last state it is especially abundant in some soils,\r\nsuch as those which are derived from mica schists, serpentines, etc. In\r\ntreating earth of this last quality with concentrated, nitric acid there\r\nis dissolved also a notable part of the magnesia of the silicates. If,\r\nhowever, it is treated for some minutes only with dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid the amount of magnesia present as carbonate alone can be estimated\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n=367. Estimation of Magnesia in Soils.=—_Method of the Halle\r\nStation._—For the estimation of magnesia the sample of soil or\r\nfertilizer is brought into solution in the same way as is given for the\r\nestimation of lime. After the separation of the silicic acid, the iron\r\nand alumina are precipitated with sodium acetate. In the case of\r\nphosphoric fertilizers, ferric chlorid should first be added in order\r\nthat the excess of phosphoric acid shall be in all cases certainly\r\ncombined with the iron. After this the lime is separated as usual with\r\nammonium oxalate. After the precipitation of the lime, the magnesia is\r\nprecipitated in an ammoniacal solution with sodium phosphate and the\r\nammonium magnesium phosphate estimated exactly as in the case with the\r\nestimation of phosphoric acid, as magnesium pyrophosphate.\r\n\r\nA simpler method for the estimation of magnesia consists in\r\nprecipitating it as ammonium magnesium phosphate in the presence of a\r\nsolution of ammonium citrate, the other bases remaining in solution. In\r\nthis case the operation is carried on in an inverse way as described\r\nunder the estimation of phosphoric acid, the proper quantity of the acid\r\nsolution being neutralized with ammonia and after the addition of sodium\r\nphosphate, the required quantity of citrate solution added and a further\r\nexcess of ammonia supplied.\r\n\r\n=368. Estimation of Manganese.=—The estimation of manganese in the\r\npresence of Fe₂O₃, Al₂O₃, CaO, etc., presents peculiar difficulties. In\r\nordinary alluvial clays the quantity of manganese is proportionately\r\nsmall and its estimation may be neglected. In volcanic clays the\r\nquantity of manganese, in proportion to the lime and magnesia, is much\r\nlarger. The method used for estimating manganese is that of Carnot.[235]\r\nThe hydrochloric acid extract of the soil is evaporated to dryness and\r\nheated with potassium bisulfate in order to destroy the organic\r\nsubstance, the neutralized solution of the residue precipitated with\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of hydrogen peroxid solution and thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonia. The colorless filtrate gives, with nitric acid\r\nand bismuth peroxid, no trace of reaction for manganese. The\r\nprecipitate, washed by decantation, is carried into a carbon dioxid\r\napparatus and treated with oxalic acid and dilute sulfuric acid. From\r\nthe amount of carbon dioxid obtained, the quantity of manganese is\r\ncalculated on the supposition that the precipitate corresponds to the\r\nformula Mn₆O₁₁.\r\n\r\n=369. Estimation of the Manganese by the French Method.=—Manganese\r\nexists in all plants and its presence in small quantities seems\r\nnecessary to vegetation. The method of estimation adopted by the French\r\nCommission is the one proposed by Leclerc and is applicable even when\r\nthe base exists in small quantities.\r\n\r\nTwenty grams of the soil are taken and the organic matter destroyed by\r\nincineration. In a flask of 200 cubic centimeters capacity, are placed\r\nthirty cubic centimeters of water and, little by little, some\r\nhydrochloric acid for the purpose of decomposing the calcium carbonate.\r\nWhen effervescence has ceased ten cubic centimeters of the same acid are\r\nadded and boiled for half an hour, filtered, washed, and the wash-water\r\nand filtrate evaporated to dryness in a porcelain dish. Afterwards there\r\nare added twenty cubic centimeters of nitric acid of one and two-tenths\r\ndensity, and ten cubic centimeters of water. The liquor is boiled with\r\nconstant shaking. Afterwards there are thrown in, in two or three\r\nportions, ten grams of lead dioxid. The boiling is stopped just at the\r\nmoment when all the lead oxid is introduced into the liquor and the\r\nmixture is then shaken vigorously. The manganese is transformed by this\r\ntreatment into a highly oxygenized compound having a deep rose\r\ncoloration. It is transferred immediately afterwards to a graduated\r\ncylinder of 100 cubic centimeters capacity, with the wash-waters the\r\nvolume is completed to 100 cubic centimeters and it is vigorously\r\nstirred with a rod, flattened at its extremity, in order to obtain a\r\ncomplete homogeneity of the liquid. The stirring rod is withdrawn and\r\nthe liquid left to settle. At the end of some minutes the principal part\r\nof the liquid is clear, and it is decanted by means of a pipette\r\ngraduated at fifty cubic centimeters, and this quantity of the clear\r\nliquid is poured into a small glass precipitating jar to which is added\r\nimmediately, with constant stirring, a solution of mercurous nitrate\r\nfrom a graduated burette. The addition of the nitrate is arrested at the\r\nmoment when the rose color of the liquor disappears, and the volume of\r\nthe mercurous nitrate employed is read from the burette.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to determine the strength of the mercurous nitrate,\r\nthat is the quantity necessary to decolorize one milligram of manganese.\r\nFor this purpose dissolve by means of five cubic centimeters of\r\nhydrochloric acid 150 milligrams of manganese dioxid, which is prepared\r\nperfectly pure by means of precipitation. When the solution is complete\r\nevaporate to dryness, add one cubic centimeter of sulfuric acid and heat\r\non a sand-bath until white fumes of sulfuric acid appear. Redissolve in\r\nwater and make the volume up to 100 cubic centimeters. Each cubic\r\ncentimeter of this solution should contain one milligram of manganese.\r\nTake five cubic centimeters of this solution, equivalent to five\r\nmilligrams of manganese, treat in a capsule with twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric acid and ten cubic centimeters of water,\r\nafterwards add ten grams of lead dioxid, carrying on the operation\r\nexactly as described above. Fifty cubic centimeters, taken as before\r\ndescribed, are then decolorized by the solution of mercurous nitrate,\r\nand thus it is easy to calculate the quantity of manganese which\r\ncorresponds to one cubic centimeter of the mercurous nitrate employed.\r\nBy a simple proportion the quantity of manganese contained in the twenty\r\ngrams of earth to be analyzed is calculated.\r\n\r\nThe mercurous nitrate is prepared by dissolving five grams of\r\ncrystallized mercurous nitrate in one liter of water; it is allowed to\r\nrepose for some time and is preserved in a well-stoppered flask.\r\n\r\n=370. Estimation of Iron.=—Iron, in general, is quite abundant in the\r\nsoil where it is met with, principally in the state of anhydrous\r\nsesquioxid or the hydrated sesquioxid of silicates. Some soils, however,\r\nonly contain iron in small proportions and it can happen that the\r\nintroduction of iron as a fertilizing element may be useful. Plants\r\nassimilate iron only in small quantities, but it appears to be\r\nindispensable to their development and to the proper functional activity\r\nof their assimilating faculties. The method of estimation which is\r\nrecommended is based upon the decoloration of potassium permanganate by\r\niron in the ferrous state. The following description, based on the\r\nmethod proposed by the French Commission, will illustrate the process to\r\nbe followed.\r\n\r\nTen grams of the soil are ignited in a porcelain capsule until all\r\norganic matter is destroyed. The ignited mass is then introduced into a\r\nflask of 100 cubic centimeters capacity with thirty cubic centimeters of\r\nhydrochloric acid and fifteen cubic centimeters of water. It is boiled\r\nfor about half an hour. The iron oxid is dissolved and is found in\r\nsolution in the form of ferric chlorid. After filtering and washing, the\r\nvolume of the filtrate is reduced by evaporation to about twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters. The liquor is afterwards placed in a flask of from\r\n100 to 150 cubic centimeters capacity, which is closed by a stopper\r\ncarrying a tube furnished with a valve destined to prevent the\r\nre-entrance of the air. Ten cubic centimeters of dilute sulfuric acid\r\nare added from a mixture containing twenty cubic centimeters of strong\r\nacid and eighty cubic centimeters of water. Afterwards the iron is\r\nreduced to the ferrous state by introducing into the flask, in\r\nquantities of about five decigrams, metallic zinc and waiting after each\r\naddition until the portion last added is dissolved before adding\r\nanother. This addition of zinc is continued until the iron is all\r\nreduced. When this point is reached and the last portion of zinc added\r\nis dissolved, the contents of the flask are transferred rapidly to a\r\nprecipitating glass of about one liter capacity, in which there has been\r\nplaced a little lately boiled but cold water. The flask is washed\r\nseveral times with cold water, previously boiled, to remove from it all\r\ntraces of oxygen. The volume is made up to 500 cubic centimeters, and\r\nafterwards, without any loss of time, by means of a graduated burette\r\nand with constant stirring, a solution of potassium permanganate is\r\nadded which is stopped exactly at the moment when the liquor begins\r\ntaking on a light rose tint. The quantity of permanganate employed is\r\nread from the burette and is proportional to the amount of iron\r\ncontained in the soil. A blank operation is made for the purpose of\r\ndetecting traces of iron which the zinc may contain. If, as often\r\nhappens, the soil contains a large amount of iron it is advisable to use\r\nonly one gram of it for this operation. The aspect of the earth will\r\nindicate in general if it be very ferruginous.\r\n\r\n_Preparation and Standardization of the Permanganate Liquor._—In one\r\nliter of water are dissolved ten grams of crystallized potassium\r\npermanganate and the quantity of iron which corresponds to one cubic\r\ncentimeter of this liquor is determined. It may be well enough to remark\r\nthat this liquor does not remain constant and it is necessary to titrate\r\nit from time to time. For this purpose pure iron is taken. Piano wire\r\nmay be used, being almost pure iron. One-tenth of a gram of this wire is\r\ndissolved in a flask in the manner recommended for treating the soil and\r\nwith the same quantities of acid and water. When the solution is\r\ncomplete it is transferred to the flask to be estimated. It is made up\r\nto one liter and permanganate added, just as in the case before\r\nmentioned, until the rose color persists. There is thus determined the\r\nquantity of iron which corresponds to each cubic centimeter of the\r\npermanganate, and by a simple proportion, the quantity of iron contained\r\nin the soil analyzed is determined.\r\n\r\nThe Italian agricultural chemists proceed essentially in the same manner\r\nin determining the iron in soils, first igniting the sample and\r\nafterwards extracting the iron in the ferric state with boiling\r\nhydrochloric acid, reducing with hydrogen, and titrating with potassium\r\npermanganate.\r\n\r\nThe following are the reactions which take place:\r\n\r\nFe₂O₃ + 6HCl = Fe₂Cl₆ + 3H₂O.\r\n\r\nFe₂Cl₆ + 2H = 2FeCl₂ + 2HCl.\r\n\r\n10FeCl₂ + K₂Mn₂O₈ + 16HCl = 5Fe₂Cl₆ + 2KCl + 2MnCl₂ + 8H₂O.\r\n\r\nSulfuric may take the place of hydrochloric acid in the above reactions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 68.\r\n\r\n  APPARATUS BY SACHSSE AND BECKER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=371. Method of Sachsse and Becker.=[236]—Ferric oxid (not as silicate)\r\nin soils can be estimated by reducing with hydrogen, and measuring the\r\nhydrogen which is evolved by the action of the reduced iron on an acid.\r\nThe sample of soil is weighed in a platinum boat, the boat put into a\r\nwide glass tube and heated in a stream of dry hydrogen. While this is\r\ngoing on, water is boiled in the flask _A_ (see Fig. 68) from which the\r\nstopper has been removed, to drive out the air. When the reduction of\r\nthe ferric oxid is complete, the boat is slipped out of the tube into\r\nthe flask without interrupting the hydrogen evolution. In order to\r\naccomplish this without allowing the reduced iron to come in contact\r\nwith the air the flask is inclined, the end of the glass tube inserted\r\nuntil it is covered with water and the boat is then dropped beneath the\r\nwater. The flask is closed with a cork provided with a funnel tube, _B_,\r\nand a delivery tube _C_; the tap _a_ is opened, and tube _b_ connected\r\nwith a carbon dioxid apparatus from which the gas is passed into _A_\r\nuntil all the air is displaced. This point is determined by filling the\r\nburette _D_ with potash-lye by aspiration at _C_ and allowing the\r\nescaping gas from _C_ to enter the burette as indicated in the figure.\r\nAny residual gas in _D_ is removed by aspiration at _C_ and allowing the\r\npotash-lye in _e_ to enter in its place. The end of the tube _C_ is now\r\nplaced under the measuring tube _D_, and the clamp _f_ opened and the\r\ntap _a_ closed. The funnel is filled with dilute, boiled sulfuric acid,\r\nthe cork of _b_ replaced and connected with the carbon dioxid apparatus.\r\nThe burner under _A_ is lighted and acid let in. By continued boiling,\r\nall the hydrogen is driven into _D_, the carbon dioxid being absorbed.\r\nThe measuring tube is then placed in a tall cylinder of water, the\r\nvolume of gas read and reduced to 0° and 760 millimeters barometric\r\npressure. To be certain that all carbon dioxid is absorbed, some fresh\r\npotash-lye may be introduced into _D_ by carefully opening _d_. The iron\r\nis then computed from the volume and weight of the hydrogen by the\r\nformula (1) Fe + H₂SO₄ = 2H + FeSO₄.\r\n\r\nIf the substance analyzed contains iron silicates, these may be partly\r\ndecomposed with formation of ferrous sulfate, according to the reaction\r\n(2) 2Fe + Fe₂(SO₄)₃ = 3FeSO₄. This will redissolve a part of the\r\nmetallic iron and yield ferrous oxid. In this case the contents of the\r\nflask are cooled in an atmosphere of carbon dioxid, made up to 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters, of which 250 cubic centimeters are quickly filtered and\r\ntitrated with permanganate. In order to properly distribute the iron in\r\nharmony with its previously existing states the following computations\r\nmay be made:\r\n\r\n      Represent the ferrous oxid corresponding to formula (1) by x\r\n           and that                       „       „     „ (2) by z\r\n           and that found by titration with permanganate     by a.\r\n\r\nWe have then the equation x + z = a. Since seventy-two parts by weight\r\nof ferrous oxid formed by formula (1) are equivalent to two parts by\r\nweight of hydrogen, x parts of ferrous oxid would set free x/32 parts of\r\nhydrogen; and this corresponds to the hydrogen found in _D_; _viz._, b.\r\n\r\nIf a = ¹⁄₃₆ then by solving the equations: Z = a − 36b and X = 36b. The\r\nferrous oxid arising according to formula (2), however, is derived in\r\nsuch a way that only one-third of it corresponds to metallic iron. Then:\r\nX + (⅓)z = (⅓)a + 24b. For computing the total ferric oxid reduced by\r\nhydrogen there must, therefore, be added twenty-four parts by weight of\r\nhydrogen for one-third of the ferrous oxid found by titration with\r\npermanganate, and this quantity of ferrous calculated to ferric oxid.\r\nSome silicates, such as the micas, give ferrous oxid with hot dilute\r\nsulfuric acid. A correction for this is made by making one or more\r\ndeterminations without previously reducing with hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe method of procedure above described appears to be capable of giving\r\nin an easily attainable manner some valuable indications of the state in\r\nwhich iron exists in a soil. While plants do not use any notable\r\nquantity of iron during their growth nevertheless its physiological\r\nimportance is unquestioned. The chief points of difficulty to be\r\nconsidered are found in the changes which the iron may undergo even\r\nwhile heating in a stream of hydrogen, and the practical difficulties of\r\nobtaining carbon dioxid entirely free of air. The latter difficulty may\r\nbe overcome by making blank experiments with carbon dioxid alone and\r\nestimating the volume of residual gas. The total volume of hydrogen\r\nobtained is then to be diminished by the ascertained amount.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the second point it is known that both ferrous and ferric\r\noxids when ignited with hydrated silicates partly decompose and form new\r\nsilicates. Care should therefore be taken not to carry the temperature\r\ntoo high during the process of ignition.\r\n\r\n=372. Carnot’s Method for Estimating Phosphoric Acid in\r\nSoils.=—Carnot[237] proposes the following procedure for the estimation\r\nof phosphoric acid in soils. The principle of this method depends upon\r\nthe isolation of silica by the double precipitation of phosphomolybdate.\r\n\r\nTen grams of the sifted soil, dried at 100°, are charred if organic\r\nmatter be present. The charred mass is next moistened with water and\r\nafterwards with nitric acid, until the carbonates are decomposed.\r\nAfterwards the mass is digested with ten cubic centimeters of nitric\r\nacid for two hours at about 100°, with frequent stirring and the\r\naddition of fresh acid, from time to time, to replace that which has\r\nbeen evaporated. After filtering and washing with hot water the filtrate\r\nis evaporated to a volume of fifty cubic centimeters and treated with\r\nfive cubic centimeters of concentrated nitric acid and half a gram of\r\ncrystals of chromic acid. After covering the dish with a funnel to\r\nreturn condensed vapors its contents are heated to the boiling point for\r\nhalf an hour. At the end of this time five grams of ammonium nitrate are\r\nadded and afterwards fifty cubic centimeters of molybdate solution and\r\nthe mixture kept at a temperature of about 100° for an hour. The\r\nprecipitate obtained is washed twice by decantation with water\r\ncontaining one-fifth of its volume of ammonium molybdate solution. It is\r\nthen dissolved in thirty cubic centimeters of ammonia diluted with an\r\nequal bulk of warm water. The solution and the washings should measure\r\neighty cubic centimeters and the ammonia therein is neutralized with\r\nnitric acid, keeping the temperature below 40°. When the yellow\r\nprecipitate formed ceases to redissolve on stirring, a mixture of three\r\ncubic centimeters of pure nitric acid and five cubic centimeters of\r\nwater is added, together with the same quantity of molybdate solution.\r\nThe precipitate is brought upon a filter, washed first with water\r\ncontaining one per cent of nitric acid and finally with a little pure\r\nwater, and dried at 100° and weighed. The weight of the precipitate\r\nmultiplied by the factor 0.0373 gives the quantity of phosphoric acid.\r\nThe object of the second precipitation is to relieve the process of the\r\nnecessity of rendering the silica insoluble, as the presence of silica\r\nin the solution as above treated does not interfere with the complete\r\nprecipitation of the phosphate. This was proved by the author, by the\r\nintroduction of considerable quantities of sodium silicate and these\r\nwere found not to interfere with the accuracy of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe results are as accurate as those obtained by the methods of the\r\nconsulting committee of the agricultural stations. The coefficient\r\nemployed; _viz._, 0.0373, is not the same as that recommended by the\r\ncommittee; _viz._, 0.043. The committee, however, itself has recognized\r\nthe inaccuracy of the latter number. The composition of the compound\r\nobtained by double precipitation according to Carnot is\r\nP₂O₅24MoO₃3(NH₄)₂O + 3H₂O.\r\n\r\n=373. Method of the Halle Experiment Station.=—The available or easily\r\nsoluble phosphoric acid in soils is estimated by Maercker and Gerlach,\r\nas follows:[238]\r\n\r\nSixty grams of the air-dried soil as prepared for analysis, are placed\r\nin an erlenmeyer with 300 cubic centimeters of two per cent citric acid\r\nsolution and digested for twenty-four hours in the cold. It is necessary\r\nin this time to shake the flask four or five times and to put the\r\nstoppers in loosely in order to allow the escape of any evolved carbon\r\ndioxid. Of this mixture 200 cubic centimeters are filtered and\r\nevaporated in a 300 cubic centimeter dish to dryness. There remains, in\r\nmost cases, a sirupy-like mass from which even by strong heating the\r\nsilica is not completely separated. In order to reach this result the\r\nresidue is treated with twenty cubic centimeters of concentrated\r\nsulfuric and five cubic centimeters of fuming nitric acid and heated\r\nover a bunsen. As soon as the appearance of foam denotes the beginning\r\nof the reaction the lamp must be removed. With strong foaming and the\r\nevolution of red-brown vapors the citric acid is completely oxidized.\r\nAfter the reaction is ended the contents of the dish are heated for\r\nabout fifteen minutes over a small flame so that a continuous, yet not\r\ntoo violent evolution of sulfuric acid fumes takes place. After the\r\nsilicic acid and the greater part of the lime have been separated in\r\nthis way the contents of the dish are diluted with water, stirred with a\r\nglass rod, washed into a 200 cubic centimeter flask, cooled, filled up\r\nto the mark, and filtered. From the filtrate 100 cubic centimeters,\r\ncorresponding to twenty grams of the earth, are taken, made slightly\r\nalkaline with ammonia, acidified by a few drops of hydrochloric acid,\r\nand after cooling treated with fifty cubic centimeters of the citrate\r\nsolution and twenty-five cubic centimeters of the magnesia mixture. The\r\ncomplete separation of the precipitate requires about forty-eight hours\r\nand shaking of the precipitate is not necessary.\r\n\r\n=374. Estimation of total Phosphoric Acid in Soils.=—In the method used\r\nat the Halle Station[239] twenty-five grams of the soil sample are\r\nboiled with twenty cubic centimeters of nitric acid and fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of concentrated sulfuric acid for half an hour. With very\r\nclayey soils only half the quantity of the sample mentioned above is\r\nused in order to avoid the too great accumulation of soluble alumina.\r\nThe oxidation of the organic substances of the soils must be carried on\r\nat a moderate heat to avoid foaming. During the boiling, the flask is to\r\nbe often shaken to prevent the soil constituents from accumulating too\r\nfirmly at the bottom. The total volume is finally made up to 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nFor the estimation, 100 cubic centimeters of the solution, corresponding\r\nto five (or two and a half) grams of the soil, are taken. In order to\r\nnearly completely saturate the acid, the solution is treated with twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of twenty-four per cent ammonia, care being taken that\r\nthe precipitate of iron and alumina which is formed is again completely\r\ndissolved. The solution is cooled and treated with fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the citrate solution, and then with twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonia of above strength, and precipitated with the\r\nmagnesia mixture. The filtration of the precipitate should not be made\r\nfor at least forty-eight hours, during which time the flask should be\r\noften shaken to prevent the attachment of ammonium magnesium phosphate\r\nto its sides and bottom.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the citrate method for estimating phosphoric\r\nacid will be found in the chapter devoted to this subject under\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\n=375. French Method for Phosphoric Acid.=—Phosphoric acid is found in\r\nthe soil principally in combination with alumina and iron oxid, with\r\norganic matters, or with lime and magnesia. Whatever may be the state in\r\nwhich it is found all the phosphoric acid, with the exception of that\r\nwhich enters into the constitution of insoluble mineral particles, can\r\nbe brought into solution by acids and determined by some of the approved\r\nmethods. This method of solution, therefore, is capable of determining\r\nvery accurately the total proportion of phosphoric acid in the soil, but\r\nit is incapable of rendering account to us of the state in which the\r\nphosphorus is found and of its aptitude to be utilized by plants.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of soil phosphorus, as recommended by the French\r\nCommission, is carried on in the following way:[240] Twenty grams of the\r\nearth are submitted to ignition in a muffle heated to the temperature of\r\nredness but not higher. This calcination eliminates the organic\r\nmaterials, whose intervention in subsequent reactions might be able to\r\nprevent the precipitation of a part of the phosphoric acid. The calcined\r\nearth is placed in a capsule of about eleven centimeters diameter and\r\nsaturated with water. There is then added in small quantities, as long\r\nas effervescence is produced, nitric acid of 36° baumé. When the\r\neffervescence has ceased, after thorough shaking and the addition of a\r\nnew quantity of acid, it will be found that the whole of the calcium\r\ncarbonate in the soil has been decomposed. It is necessary then to\r\nproceed to the solution of the phosphoric acid by adding twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric acid and heating on the steam-bath for five hours,\r\nshaking from time to time, and avoiding complete desiccation. At the end\r\nof this time the whole of the phosphoric acid has entered into solution.\r\nIt is taken up by warm water, filtered, and the insoluble residue washed\r\nwith small quantities of boiling water. But from the solution obtained,\r\nwhich holds in addition to phosphoric acid, some oxid of iron, alumina,\r\nlime, magnesia, etc., it is necessary to separate the silica which has\r\npassed into solution. For this purpose the mass is evaporated to dryness\r\non a sand-bath, heating toward the end of the operation with precaution\r\nand not allowing the temperature to pass beyond 110°–120°. In these\r\nconditions there is obtained a magma which sometimes remains quite\r\nsirupy when the earth is very highly impregnated with calcium carbonate,\r\nbut in which the silica is insoluble. It is indispensable that it be\r\neliminated wholly because it would introduce grave errors into the\r\nresults, as will be seen later on. If the temperature be carried too\r\nhigh during the desiccation this silica would react upon the earthy\r\nsalts and alkaline earths forming silicates and it would be found\r\nultimately again in solution. The application of a too high temperature\r\nwould also render somewhat insoluble in nitric acid the iron and\r\naluminum oxids, and these would retain small quantities of phosphoric\r\nacid. The desiccation, therefore, requires to be conducted with great\r\nprecaution. When it is accomplished there are placed in the capsule five\r\ncubic centimeters of nitric acid and five cubic centimeters of water,\r\nand the whole heated on the sand-bath until the entire amount of iron\r\noxid is dissolved, that is to say, until there is no ferruginous deposit\r\npersisting in the liquid. The solution is then filtered and washed with\r\nsmall quantities of boiling water in such a way that the total volume of\r\nthe filtrate will not exceed twenty-five to thirty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters. Afterwards there are added twenty cubic centimeters of\r\nammonium nitromolybdate and the whole is left at rest for twelve hours\r\nat the ordinary temperature. At the end of this time the whole of the\r\nphosphoric acid is precipitated in the form of ammonium\r\nphosphomolybdate. In order to be certain that an excess of\r\nnitromolybdate has been used in the precipitation, which is\r\nindispensable to the total precipitation of the phosphoric acid, a few\r\ncubic centimeters of the filtrate are removed by means of a pipette and\r\nare mixed with their own volume of the ammonium nitromolybdate. If, at\r\nthe end of an hour or two, no precipitate is formed the operation can be\r\nregarded as terminated.\r\n\r\nIn order to collect and weigh the ammonium phosphomolybdate some\r\nprecautions are necessary. Two smooth filters are used, one of which\r\nserves as a counter-weight for the other on the balance. One of these\r\nfilters is placed within the other and the phosphomolybdate is collected\r\nupon the inner filter. The part of the phosphomolybdate adhering to the\r\nprecipitating jar is detached by the aid of a stirring rod, one of the\r\nends of which is covered with a piece of rubber tubing. The washing is\r\naccomplished with very small quantities of water containing five per\r\ncent of its volume of nitric acid. When all of the precipitate is\r\ncollected upon the filter and the washing is terminated a few drops of\r\nwater are thrown upon the upper borders of the filters; this is done to\r\ndisplace the acid liquor which has been used in washing. The filters are\r\nthen carried to the drying oven where they are dried at a temperature\r\nnot exceeding 90°. The application of a higher temperature would\r\ndecompose the ammonium phosphomolybdate and lead to results which would\r\nbe too low. After the drying is completed the two filters are separated\r\nand placed upon the arms of the balance and the increase in weight\r\ncorresponds to the ammonium phosphomolybdate. This, multiplied by the\r\ncoefficient 0.043, (see page 404) gives the quantity of phosphoric acid\r\ncontained in the weight of the soil which has been employed. The\r\nammonium phosphomolybdate is pure if all the silica has been eliminated,\r\nbut if a part of that has remained in solution it would furnish an\r\nammonium silicomolybdate whose weight would be added to that of the\r\nphosphomolybdate. The elimination of the silica, therefore, should be\r\nmade with the greatest care.\r\n\r\nDifferent processes have been proposed in order to determine the forms\r\nunder which phosphoric acid should be regarded as most assimilable.\r\nDeherain has proposed acetic acid as a solvent for this purpose. Other\r\nscientists, oxalic or citric acid, and the ammonium oxalate or citrate.\r\nThe solubility of phosphoric acid in these different reagents gives some\r\ninformation in regard to its state, but the relations which exist\r\nbetween this solubility and the assimilability of the acid have not yet\r\nbeen fixed.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Ammonium Nitromolybdate._—One hundred grams of\r\nmolybdic acid are dissolved in 400 grams of ammonia with a density of\r\nninety-five. The mixture is filtered, and the filtered liquor is\r\nreceived drop by drop in 1,500 grams of nitric acid of one and\r\ntwo-tenths density, constantly stirring. This mixture is left standing\r\nfor some days in an unexposed locality, during which time a deposit is\r\nformed. The clear part is decanted and used.\r\n\r\nThe above method of the French chemists unfortunately attempts to\r\ndetermine the phosphorus content of the soil by weighing the yellow\r\nprecipitate and using an empirical factor for the calculation, a factor\r\nwhich is probably too high.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that at this point it is far more accurate to\r\ncontinue the process by dissolving the yellow precipitate, and\r\nsubsequently obtaining the phosphoric acid in combination with ammonia\r\nand magnesia, or according to the process of Pemberton the content of\r\nphosphoric acid in the yellow precipitate might be determined by\r\ntitration. In regard to the latter method which will be given in full\r\nunder fertilizers, it may be said that it has been found quite accurate\r\nby several analysts, although it is difficult to see how a precipitate\r\nwhich is so variable in its constitution as to be estimated with little\r\nsafety by weight may yet be capable of rather exact determination by\r\ntitration.\r\n\r\n=376. Petermann’s Method for the Estimation of the Phosphoric Acid\r\nSoluble in Alkaline Ammonium Citrate.=[241]—From twenty-five to fifty\r\ngrams of the sample of soil are triturated with 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nalkaline ammonium citrate and placed in a flask of 250 cubic centimeters\r\ncapacity, and allowed to digest for one hour at a temperature of from\r\n35°–40°. After cooling, make up to the mark, filter, take 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate, evaporate to dryness on a sand-bath in a\r\nplatinum dish, heat lightly at first, and afterwards to a higher\r\ntemperature. Take up the residue of the incineration with water and\r\nabout two cubic centimeters of nitric acid, heat a few minutes gently,\r\nfilter into a bohemian flask and precipitate with fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonium molybdate solution, and estimate the phosphoric\r\nacid in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=377. Method of Dyer for Total and Assimilable Phosphoric Acid.=—For the\r\ndetermination of phosphoric acid, soluble in citric acid, secured as\r\ndescribed in paragraph =328=, 500 cubic centimeters of the filtrate\r\nobtained, corresponding to fifty grams of the soil, are evaporated to\r\ndryness in a platinum dish, gently ignited, extracted with hydrochloric\r\nacid, again evaporated, ignited and extracted, and the phosphoric acid\r\ndetermined as below in the method applied to the hydrochloric acid\r\nextract of the soil itself.\r\n\r\nThe total phosphoric acid is determined in each case in ten grains of\r\nthe dried soil and also in twenty-five grams, the mean of the two\r\nresults being taken. The numbers obtained in each case are, however, all\r\nbut identical, the difference in the duplicate percentages being in most\r\ncases only a small one in the third place of decimals.\r\n\r\nThe soil is incinerated and digested with hydrochloric acid, and\r\nevaporated to dryness, redigested with acid, filtered, and washed. The\r\nfiltrate and washings are concentrated to a small bulk, and treated, in\r\nthe cold, with excess of a solution of ammonium molybdate in nitric\r\nacid. After standing forty-eight hours, the liquor is decanted through a\r\nfilter, the precipitate washed several times by decantation, first with\r\ndilute acid, then with pure water in very small doses, and finally\r\ntransferred to the filter and washed free from excess of acid. The\r\nammonium phosphomolybdate is then dissolved in ammonia, evaporated to\r\ndryness in a platinum capsule, and dried to constant weight at 100°. The\r\nresidue contains three and one-half per cent of its weight of phosphoric\r\nacid. This is the method of Hehner; and for determining small quantities\r\nof phosphoric acid, such as occur in soils or in solutions of iron and\r\nsteel, is in the opinion of Dyer very much to be preferred to the\r\nold-fashioned method of conversion into magnesium ammonium phosphate.\r\nThe solubility of the yellow precipitate in the small quantity of\r\nwash-water used is in most cases negligible. As a matter of fact, the\r\nquantity of wash-water used in these analyses was found capable of\r\ndissolving only 0.005 gram of precipitate, of which only 0.00017 is\r\nphosphoric acid, making an error of 0.0017 per cent on the soil if ten\r\ngrams be used, or of only 0.0006 if twenty-five grams be used. In the\r\ncitric acid experiments the solution from fifty grams of soil is used,\r\nwhen the error due to solubility of precipitate shrinks to 0.0003 per\r\ncent. The correction for this solubility is, however, made in each case.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that the method of Hehner is not applicable if the\r\nmolybdic solution be added to a hot liquid, since, in that case, some\r\nmolybdic acid is sure to crystallize with the yellow precipitate.\r\nModerate and careful warming to about 35° hastens precipitation, but it\r\nis preferable, when speed is not a special object, to precipitate cold,\r\nand leave the beaker standing at the laboratory temperature over night,\r\nor longer if the quantity to be determined is very minute.\r\n\r\n=378. Methods of Berthelot and André.=—The phosphorus in the soil may be\r\nfound under three forms; _viz._,\r\n\r\n1. Phosphoric acid in phosphates.\r\n\r\n2. Phosphoric acid in ethers which alkalies decompose slowly and\r\noxidizing agents destroy with regeneration of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n3. Organic compounds or mineral compounds of phosphorus which are\r\nresolved by alkaline solutions with formation of phosphoric acid and\r\nwhich are not reduced to this state by the reagents employed in the wet\r\nway of decomposition except after a contact of indefinite length and\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, seen that the employment of oxidizing agents for the\r\nvaluation of phosphoric acid in soils and vegetables is not a very\r\nreliable procedure. The same is true after incineration by which more or\r\nless phosphorus may be lost or rendered insoluble in acids. The methods\r\nused by Berthelot and André for the estimation of these forms of\r\nphosphorus are as follows:[242]\r\n\r\n_Total Phosphorus._—The sample is at first oxidized by a current of air\r\nnear a red heat and the vapors are conducted over a column of sodium or\r\npotassium carbonate at the same temperature. The combustion is finished\r\nin a current of pure oxygen. All phosphorus compounds, even those which\r\nare volatile, are by this treatment converted into phosphoric acid. The\r\npart of the acid held by the carbonate is to be determined with the\r\nnon-volatile portions.\r\n\r\nA less certain method of oxidation consists in mixing the material with\r\npotassium nitrate and carefully throwing it little by little into a red\r\nhot platinum crucible.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Phosphoric Acid Pre-existing as Phosphates._—The\r\nsample is treated with a cold dilute acid incapable of exercising an\r\noxidizing or decomposing effect on the ethers. The dissolved acid is\r\nprecipitated and weighed in the usual way. The precipitate first\r\nobtained should be ignited and the phosphoric acid taken up and\r\nreprecipitated. This is necessary to remove any organic matter or silica\r\nwhich the first precipitate may contain.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Ethereal Phosphoric Acid._—The sample is boiled for some\r\ntime with a non-oxidizing acid or with a concentrated solution of\r\npotash. The phosphoric acid dissolved represents that which was present\r\nas phosphates and as ethers. From this, deduct that portion pre-existing\r\nas phosphates and the remainder represents the part derived from the\r\nethereal compounds.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Phosphorus in Organic Compounds and Special\r\nMinerals._—From the total phosphoric acid deduct that found as\r\nphosphates and ethers. The difference represents the quantity combined\r\nas noted in the caption. Illustration.\r\n\r\nA sample of soil contained:\r\n\r\n        Total phosphoric acid                    0.292 per cent.\r\n                                                 —————\r\n        Of this, pre-existing as phosphoric acid 0.109     „\r\n        As ethereal phosphoric acid              0.074     „\r\n        As organic phosphoric acid               0.109     „\r\n                                                 —————\r\n                          Sum                    0.292     „\r\n\r\n=379. Method Used at the Riga Station.=—In the method pursued at the\r\nexperimental station at Riga[243] the organic matter in the fine earth\r\nis first destroyed by igniting twenty-five grams in a muffle. The\r\nignited residue is placed in a 250 cubic centimeter erlenmeyer and\r\ndigested with 150 cubic centimeters of ten per cent hydrochloric acid.\r\nThe digestion is continued for forty-eight hours with frequent shaking.\r\nThe filtrate is evaporated to dryness in a porcelain dish to separate\r\nany dissolved silica. The residue is taken up with dilute hot nitric\r\nacid, filtered, and the phosphoric acid precipitated with ammonium\r\nmolybdate. The final weighing is made as magnesium pyrophosphate,\r\nfollowing the usual procedure in respect of precipitation and washing.\r\nExperiments show that approximately ninety-five per cent of the\r\nphosphoric acid are obtained by one extraction and five per cent by a\r\nsecond, conducted exactly as the first. Thoms draws the following\r\nconclusions from a long series of determinations:\r\n\r\n(1) For the simple purpose of determining the need of a soil for\r\nphosphorus fertilizer a single extraction with ten per cent hydrochloric\r\nacid is sufficient. The difference between the first and second\r\nextraction; _viz._, five to six per cent is too small to be of any value\r\nfrom a practical point of view.\r\n\r\n(2) A soil which has been ignited until organic matter is destroyed\r\ngives up to the hydrochloric acid solvent about fourteen per cent more\r\nphosphoric acid than a non-ignited sample would.\r\n\r\n(3) The mean temperature in the flask during extraction on a steam-bath\r\nis 74°.\r\n\r\n=380. Method of Hilgard.=[244]—The weighed quantity of soil (usually\r\nfrom three to five grams) is ignited in a platinum crucible, care being\r\ntaken to avoid all loss. The loss of weight after full ignition gives\r\nthe amount of chemically combined water and volatile and combustible\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe ignited soil is now removed to a porcelain or glass beaker, treated\r\nwith four or five times its bulk of strong nitric acid, digested for two\r\ndays, evaporated to dryness, first over the water-bath and then over the\r\nsand-bath, moistened with nitric acid, heated and treated with water.\r\nAfter standing a few hours on the water-bath it is filtered and the\r\nfiltrate is evaporated to a very small bulk (ten cubic centimeters) and\r\ntreated with about twice its bulk of the usual ammonium molybdate\r\nsolution, thus precipitating the phosphoric acid. After standing at\r\nleast twelve hours, first at a temperature of about 50°, it is filtered\r\nand washed with a solution of ammonium nitrate acidified with nitric\r\nacid. The washed precipitate is dissolved on the filter with dilute\r\nammonia water. After washing the filter carefully, the ammoniacal\r\nsolution is treated with magnesia mixture, by which the phosphoric acid\r\nis precipitated. After allowing it to stand twenty-four hours it is\r\nfiltered, washed in the usual way, dried, ignited, and weighed as\r\nmagnesium pyrophosphate, from which the phosphoric acid is calculated.\r\nWhen a gelatinous residue remains on the filter after dissolving the\r\nphosphomolybdate with ammonia it may consist either of silica not\r\nrendered fully insoluble in the first evaporation, or, more rarely, of\r\nalumina containing phosphate. It should be treated with strong nitric\r\nacid, and the filtrate with ammonium molybdate; any precipitate formed\r\nis, of course, added to the main quantity before precipitating with\r\nmagnesia solution.\r\n\r\n=381. Separation of Phosphoric Acid From Iron and Alumina.=—The\r\nfollowing methods are suggested by Wolff[245] for the complete\r\nseparation of the phosphoric acid from the iron and alumina in soil\r\nanalysis, where large quantities of these bases are found in solution:\r\n\r\n1. After the separation of the greater part of the iron and alumina the\r\nphosphoric acid is precipitated from the solution in nitric acid by\r\nmolybdic acid. The process is carried on as follows:\r\n\r\nThe acid extract is heated in a flask to boiling and the iron oxid\r\ncompletely reduced by the gradual addition of small particles of sodium\r\nsulfite. While still warm the free acid is neutralized with soda-lye,\r\nand ammonia added until the ferrous hydroxid and the aluminum hydroxid\r\nare completely separated. Acetic acid is now added in excess and until\r\nabout four-fifths of the whole precipitate have passed again into\r\nsolution. Then, after boiling for a moment, the whole is quickly\r\nfiltered through a large filter with a cover, and the contents of the\r\nfilter finally washed slightly. All the phosphoric acid is thus obtained\r\nin combination with some alumina and a very little iron. Nearly the\r\nwhole of the iron and the larger part of the alumina, by this\r\nprecipitation, are found in the filtrate and therefore cannot disturb\r\nthe estimation of phosphoric acid in succeeding portions. The filter is\r\nnow filled with boiling water and a little nitric acid added. The\r\nprecipitate is dissolved and received in a beaker. The precipitation of\r\nthe phosphoric acid is then accomplished by ammonium molybdate in the\r\npresence of nitric acid. After twenty-four hours all the phosphoric acid\r\nis thus precipitated and the precipitate is free from iron.\r\n\r\n2. By the method of Schulze[246] the iron is completely, and the\r\nalumina, with the exception of a small quantity, separated, and the\r\nprecipitation of the phosphoric acid is accomplished either by the\r\naddition of a small quantity of tartaric acid and afterwards magnesium\r\nsulfate, or directly by means of ammonium molybdate. The principle of\r\nthe separation depends on the fact that when the hydrochloric acid is\r\nnearly neutralized with soda or ammonia, and the solution boiled after\r\ntreatment with ammonium formate, the greater part of the alumina remains\r\nin solution. The precipitate is quickly filtered, washed with hot water,\r\ndried, taken from the filter and fused in a silver crucible with pure\r\ncaustic alkali, either soda or potash. On solution and boiling with\r\nwater, the iron is completely separated from the phosphoric acid, and\r\nfrom the small quantity of the alumina present the precipitation of the\r\nphosphoric acid can now be accomplished, either by saturation of the\r\nalkaline solution with hydrochloric acid and the direct addition of the\r\nmagnesia solution after the addition of a little tartaric acid and\r\nammonia, or after the addition of nitric acid by ammonium molybdate.\r\n\r\n=382. Estimation of Phosphoric Acid in Muck and Peat Soils.=—The amount\r\nof phosphoric acid obtained by extraction with hydrochloric or sulfuric\r\nacid is markedly less in these soils than that obtained after the\r\nincineration of the sample, as pointed out by Schmoeger.[247] This is\r\ndue to the fact that the phosphoric acid is ordinarily combined in the\r\nform of nuclein. Extraction of the soils with ether shows that it is not\r\npresent in the form of lecithin. The nuclein products, as is well known,\r\nare decomposed by heating in presence of a liquid at a high temperature\r\nfor some time. The heating can either take place in an autoclave or in\r\nsealed glass tubes. The method is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe sample of soil is thoroughly rubbed up in a mortar with water, and\r\nthen hydrochloric acid added until one gram of the water-free peat is\r\nsuspended in about ten cubic centimeters of twelve per cent hydrochloric\r\nacid. The sample is placed in a glass or porcelain vessel in an\r\nautoclave and heated to 140°–160° for ten hours. The phosphoric acid is\r\nthen determined in the extract in the usual way. The percentage of\r\nphosphoric acid determined in this way is found to correspond to the\r\namount determined by the incineration of the substance.\r\n\r\nThe total phosphoric acid is determined in peats by the incineration of\r\nthe sample and the estimation of the phosphoric acid in the ash. The\r\nphosphoric acid soluble in hydrochloric acid solution is determined by\r\nextracting a sample of the soil with twelve per cent hydrochloric acid\r\nin the usual way. The difference between this and the total is\r\ncalculated as phosphoric acid in organic compounds.\r\n\r\nOr the total phosphoric acid is determined by treating the soil with\r\ntwelve per cent hydrochloric acid, in the proportion of one gram of soil\r\nto ten cubic centimeters of the acid, and the solution is placed in an\r\nautoclave and heated for ten hours to 140°–160°, as above described. The\r\nphosphoric acid is then determined by the usual method. The difference\r\nbetween the total phosphoric acid as thus determined and the phosphoric\r\nacid soluble in hydrochloric acid is calculated as phosphoric acid in\r\norganic compounds.\r\n\r\n=383. Method of Goss.=—On account of the length of time required to\r\ndetermine the phosphoric acid in soils by the usual methods, Goss[248]\r\nhas proposed the following modification which in his hands has given\r\nsatisfactory results:\r\n\r\nWeigh ten grams of the air-dried soil, which has been sifted through a\r\none millimeter mesh sieve, and transfer to a pear-shaped, straight\r\nnecked, kjeldahl digestion flask, which has been marked to hold 250\r\ncubic centimeters. Add approximately seven-tenths gram of yellow\r\nmercuric oxid and twenty to thirty cubic centimeters of concentrated\r\nsulfuric acid, as for the determination of nitrogen. Twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of acid are nearly always sufficient, but in the case of\r\nunusually finely divided clay soils containing little or no sand it is\r\nnecessary to use thirty cubic centimeters to prevent caking of contents\r\nof flask. In doubtful cases twenty cubic centimeters of acid should\r\nfirst be added and at the end of five or ten minutes, if contents show a\r\ntendency to cake, ten cubic centimeters more should be introduced.\r\nThoroughly mix the contents of the flask by shaking, place on a suitable\r\nsupport over a burner, boil for one hour, cool, add about 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, five cubic centimeters of concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid, and two cubic centimeters of concentrated nitric\r\nacid, boil gently for two minutes to oxidize iron, cool, make up to\r\nvolume, and filter through a dry folded paper until perfectly clear. In\r\norder to secure a clear filtrate it will usually be found necessary to\r\npour the first portion of the filtrate back through the paper three or\r\nfour times. Transfer 100 cubic centimeters of the filtrate to an\r\nordinary flask of about 450 cubic centimeters capacity, add strong\r\nammonia until a permanent precipitate forms, then six or eight cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric acid to dissolve the precipitate, and boil until\r\nclear. In the case of many soils it is not absolutely necessary to\r\noxidize with hydrochloric and nitric acids, as a clear solution can be\r\nsecured at this point without further oxidation. In the case of some\r\nsoils, however, and especially in subsoils, the solution cannot be\r\ncleared up even by prolonged boiling with nitric acid, but if the\r\nsolution have been previously oxidized, a clear solution can be secured\r\nwithout any difficulty whatever. Remove the flask from the lamp and\r\nafter two minutes add seventy-five cubic centimeters of molybdate\r\nsolution, place the unstoppered flask in an open water-bath kept at a\r\ntemperature of 80° for fifteen minutes, shaking vigorously four or five\r\ntimes while in the bath; then remove, let stand ten minutes to allow\r\nprecipitate to settle, filter through a nine centimeter filter avoiding\r\ntoo strong a pressure at first, wash the flask and precipitate\r\nthoroughly with ammonium nitrate solution, place the flask in which the\r\nprecipitation was made under the funnel, shut off pump and close all\r\nvalves to filtering jar to form an air-cushion and prevent too rapid\r\nfiltration, fill paper two-thirds full of hot water, add a few cubic\r\ncentimeters of strong ammonia, aid solution, if necessary, by stirring\r\nprecipitate with a small glass rod.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by Hilgard, aluminum is sometimes carried down with the\r\nphosphoric acid upon precipitating with molybdate solution, in which\r\ncase some of the phosphoric acid will not be dissolved in the treatment\r\nwith ammonia. This will be indicated, first, by the appearance of a\r\nwhite precipitate upon dissolving the yellow precipitate in ammonia;\r\nand, second, by the difficulty experienced afterward in washing. If such\r\na precipitate be present in any appreciable quantity, proceed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nAfter washing out all the ammoniacal solution in the usual manner, place\r\na small beaker under the funnel, close all valves, fill the filter\r\none-third full of hot water, add the same amount of concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid, proceed as if dissolving phosphomolybdate in ammonia,\r\nand receive final solution and washings in flask used. As soon as the\r\nyellow precipitate is dissolved open the valve to filtering jar but do\r\nnot turn on the pump; after the solution has all passed through rinse\r\nthe filter once with a small amount of hot water; after the last portion\r\nhas passed through remove the flask and place a No. 1 lipped beaker\r\nunder the funnel and heat the solution in the flask to boiling. If the\r\nsolutions have not been oxidized, a blue color is sometimes present upon\r\ndissolving the yellow precipitate in ammonia. This can be discharged by\r\nboiling the ammoniacal solution for a minute or two and shaking at the\r\nsame time. Again pour the solution through the filter, avoiding use of\r\npump at first, otherwise loss from spattering is likely to ensue, wash\r\nout flask and filter with a small amount of hot water, (the total\r\nfiltrate should not exceed fifty cubic centimeters), add hydrochloric\r\nacid to contents of beaker while hot, until yellow color appears, then\r\nadd a few drops of ammonia until solution clears, cool, add fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of filtered magnesia mixture from a burette, a drop at a\r\ntime with constant stirring, let stand fifteen minutes, add twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of strong ammonia specific gravity nine-tenths, let stand\r\nover night, filter, wash precipitate with dilute ammonia, dry, ignite\r\nintensely over blast-lamp for ten minutes, cool in desiccator and weigh\r\nMg₂P₂O₇ secured.\r\n\r\n_Time of Digestion._—Experience has shown that very little phosphoric\r\nacid is extracted from the sample by digestion with sulfuric acid after\r\nthe first thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n_Time Required to Precipitate Phosphomolybdate._— When the yellow\r\nprecipitate is obtained according to the method of Goss practically the\r\nwhole of it will be thrown down in five minutes.\r\n\r\n_Agreement with Standard Methods._—Comparative tests of the Goss method\r\nagainst standard methods have shown that it gives almost identical\r\nresults with them. The variations were never more than 0.02 to 0.03 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nWhile this method has not been sufficiently tried to receive\r\nunconditional recommendation it possesses merits which entitle it to the\r\nattention of analysts.\r\n\r\n=384. Estimation of the Sulfuric Acid.=—Sulfuric acid is generally\r\npresent in small proportions in soils. Since the plants have need of\r\nsulfur it is proper to inquire into the presence of the compound which\r\nis its principal source. It is in combination with lime that sulfuric\r\nacid exists almost always. In addition to this there is also some sulfur\r\ncombined with the organic matter of the soil.\r\n\r\nBy digesting a soil for six hours with hot, concentrated nitric acid the\r\nsulfates are dissolved, and there is transformed into sulfuric acid an\r\nimportant part of the sulfur which is combined with the humic\r\nsubstances. The quantity of soil to be operated upon should be about\r\nfifty grams.\r\n\r\nAfter filtering and washing with hot water the filtered liquor is\r\ncollected, in the French Commission method,[249] in a flask and carried\r\nto boiling, and five cubic centimeters of a saturated solution of barium\r\nchlorid or sufficient to be in slight excess are added. The boiling is\r\ncontinued for some minutes and the flask is allowed to stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours. The filtrate is received upon a filter and washed\r\nwith boiling water. The filter is dried and incinerated, allowed to\r\ncool, and as there may have been a slight reduction of the sulfate a few\r\ndrops of nitric acid are added and a drop of sulfuric acid. It is now\r\nevaporated to dryness on a water-bath, heated to redness for a few\r\nmoments, cooled and weighed. The weight of the barium sulfate obtained\r\nmultiplied by 0.3433, gives the quantity of sulfuric acid obtained from\r\nthe fifty grams of soil.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to estimate only the sulfur which exists in the form of\r\nsulfate it is necessary to treat the soil with hydrochloric acid in a\r\nvery dilute state, heating for a few moments only and afterwards\r\nprecipitate by barium nitrate. If, on the other hand, it is desired to\r\nestimate the total sulfur which is sometimes of great interest, it is\r\nnecessary to employ the process of Berthelot and André.\r\n\r\n=385. Method of Berthelot and André.=—Sulfur may exist in the soil in\r\nthree forms; _viz._,\r\n\r\n1. Mineral compounds, consisting generally of sulfates and sometimes of\r\nsulfids.\r\n\r\n2. Sulfur, existing in ethereal compounds or their analogues, as in\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n3. Organic compounds containing sulfur.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Total Sulfur._—The principle on which this operation, as\r\ndescribed by Berthelot and André, rests is that already described for\r\nphosphorus; _viz._, oxidation in a current of oxygen and passing the\r\nvapors over a column of alkaline carbonate at or near a red heat.[250]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary methods of oxidation in the wet way give generally inexact\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Sulfur Pre-existing as Sulfates._—The sample is treated\r\nwith cold, dilute hydrochloric acid. The filtrate is treated with barium\r\nchlorid, the precipitate collected, dried, ignited, washed with a\r\nmixture of sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids to remove silica, and\r\nafterwards weighed as barium sulfate.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Sulfur as Sulfids._—The sample is distilled with dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, and the hydrogen sulfid produced is made to pass\r\nthrough an acidulated solution of copper sulfate in such a way as to\r\ntransform the sulfur in the hydrogen sulfid into a sulfid, which is\r\nafterwards collected and weighed in the usual way. The use of a titrated\r\nsolution of iodin is not advisable on account of the organic matter\r\nwhich may be present.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Sulfur in Ethereal Compounds._—These compounds can be\r\ndecomposed by boiling with a solution of potash or concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid. The resulting sulfuric acid is precipitated with\r\nbarium chlorid. Subtract from the sulfates thus obtained those\r\npre-existing as sulfates; the difference represents the sulfur present\r\nin ethers.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Sulfur in Other Organic Compounds._—This is estimated\r\nindirectly by subtracting from the total sulfur that present as\r\nsulfates, sulfids, and ethers.\r\n\r\n=386. Method of Von Bemmelén.=—As Von Bemmelén[251] observes, the\r\nestimation of sulfuric acid in soils presents a number of difficulties.\r\nA small part of it can be present as sulfate insoluble in water. In\r\naddition to this, there is always some sulfur in the organic bodies\r\npresent. If the soil is extracted with water then the sulfuric acid can\r\nbe estimated therein when only a trace of humus substance has gone into\r\nsolution. On the contrary, if there is much humus substance in solution,\r\nand also iron oxid, as is the case when the extraction is made with\r\nhydrochloric acid, then both of these must be removed, otherwise the\r\nestimation is very inexact. By fusing the residue of the solution with\r\nsodium carbonate and a little potassium nitrate the organic substance is\r\ndestroyed, and after treatment with water the iron oxid is separated. If\r\nany sulfur has been dissolved in the organic substance present, this is\r\nthen oxidized to sulfuric acid. The estimation of the sulfuric acid and\r\nof the sulfur, therefore, remains unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn a sample of clay from Java, which was rich in calcium carbonate, but\r\nwhich contained no basic iron sulfate, there was found the following\r\npercentages of sulfuric acid:\r\n\r\nExhausted in the cold with very weak hydrochloric acid, 0.04 per cent;\r\nthe residue treated in the cold with concentrated hydrochloric acid, the\r\nsolution evaporated and fused with sodium carbonate and potassium\r\nnitrate, 0.07 per cent; again, the residue treated with aqua regia to\r\noxidize the sulfur, the solution evaporated to dryness, fused with\r\nsodium carbonate and potassium nitrate, 0.14 per cent; in all 0.25\r\npercent. A sample of the same soil treated directly with aqua regia, and\r\nthen evaporated and fused as above, gave two-tenths per cent sulfuric\r\nacid. A sample of the same soil ignited in a crucible with sodium\r\ncarbonate and potassium nitrate gave 0.16 per cent of sulfuric acid. The\r\ndifference between 0.04 and 0.07 per cent can be attributed to the\r\nsulfur in the organic substance which was dissolved by the concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid; the quantity, however, is too small to draw any safe\r\nconclusion. Possibly it might have been that the very dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid did not dissolve all of the sulfate. The quantity of\r\nsulfur combined in the organic substance in the above soil may be\r\nderived from the following equation; _viz._, (0.2–0.07)/(80) × 32 = 0.05\r\nper cent of sulfur.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of the sulfur in a sample of soil from Deli was carried\r\non with still greater exactness by three different methods.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sodium carbonate\r\nemployed were measured or weighed, and the minute content of sulfuric\r\nacid therein estimated and subtracted from the final results. The\r\nmethods employed were as follows:\r\n\r\n(A) Extraction with water and afterwards with very dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n(B) Extraction with cold hydrochloric acid, one part to three of water.\r\n\r\n(C) Extraction with aqua regia.\r\n\r\n(D) Ignition with sodium carbonate and potassium nitrate.\r\n\r\n(F) Ignition in a combustion tube with sodium carbonate in a stream of\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\nThe percentages of sulfuric acid obtained by the different methods were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                          (A) 0.058 per cent.\r\n                          (B) 0.070  „    „\r\n                          (C) 0.140  „    „\r\n                          (D) 0.125  „    „\r\n                          (F) 0.106  „    „\r\n\r\n=387. Method of Wolff.=—In regard to the sulfuric acid Wolff calls\r\nattention to the fact that in soils which have been ignited, a larger\r\nquantity of this acid is found than in soils containing humus.[252]\r\nThis, doubtless, arises from the oxidation of the organic sulfur. The\r\nfollowing special method for determining the sulfuric acid is therefore\r\nproposed:\r\n\r\nFifty grams of fresh air-dried soil are placed in a platinum dish with a\r\nconcentrated solution of pure sodium nitrate. After drying, the heat is\r\nraised gradually to redness. In this way the complete ignition of the\r\nhumus present takes place. After cooling, the mass is diluted with\r\nhydrochloric acid, with the addition of a little nitric acid, and\r\nboiled. In the solution, the silicic acid is first separated and the\r\nsulfuric acid estimated in the usual way with barium sulfate.\r\n\r\n=388. Method of the Italian Chemists.=—The determination of the sulfuric\r\nacid is conducted as follows by the Italian chemists:[253] The soil is\r\ncompletely extracted by diluted hydrochloric acid and the sulfuric acid\r\nprecipitated in the solution with barium chlorid. If a soil is very rich\r\nin calcium sulfate it should first be treated with a warm solution of\r\nsodium carbonate to decompose the calcium sulfate, and the sulfuric acid\r\ndetermined in the solution after having added hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n=389. Estimation of the Chlorin.=—The estimation of the chlorin is of\r\ngreat importance in certain cases. When this element is lacking in the\r\nsoil, which, however, is rare, certain plants appear to suffer from its\r\nabsence. The quality of the forage plants in particular is influenced by\r\nit; but when the chlorids are too abundant, which is a frequent case,\r\nthey prevent or arrest completely the progress of vegetation. Salty\r\nsoils are, in general, completely sterile. In the proportion of one\r\npound in a thousand in the earth, sodium chlorid is to be regarded as\r\ninjurious. It is necessary, therefore, in analysis to take account of\r\ntwo cases; _viz._, those of soils poor in chlorids and those of soils\r\nrich in chlorids.\r\n\r\nFor soils poor in chlorids the French method directs that[254] 200 grams\r\nof the earth are to be washed on a filter with boiling water. The liquor\r\nis evaporated to dryness and gently heated to a temperature inferior to\r\nredness in order to destroy the organic matter. The residue is taken up\r\nby small quantities of water and to the filtered liquor the volume of\r\nwhich should not exceed forty to fifty cubic centimeters are added ten\r\ncubic centimeters of pure nitric acid and a sufficient quantity of\r\nsilver nitrate to produce a complete precipitation. The precipitate is\r\nvigorously shaken and allowed to stand for a few hours in a darkened\r\nlocality. The precipitate is collected upon a double filter and the\r\nsilver chlorid, after proper desiccation, is weighed.\r\n\r\nWhen the soil is rich in chlorids it is washed as has just been\r\ndescribed upon a filter. The wash-waters are made up to one liter and\r\nfifty cubic centimeters, equivalent to ten grams of the soil, are taken\r\nfor analysis. This quantity is treated exactly as described above.\r\n\r\n=390. Wolff’s Method of Estimating Chlorin in Soils.=[255]—Three hundred\r\ngrams of the soil are treated with 900 cubic centimeters of pure water\r\ncontaining a little nitric acid for forty-eight hours with frequent\r\nshaking. Four hundred and fifty cubic centimeters are then filtered and\r\nthe clear liquid evaporated to 200 cubic centimeters. The chlorin is\r\nthen precipitated with silver nitrate. The quantity obtained,\r\ncorresponds to that found in 150 grams of the air-dried soil.\r\n\r\nA second method, Mohr’s, is as follows: Fifty grams of the soil are\r\nplaced in a platinum dish and moistened with a concentrated solution of\r\npotassium nitrate, free from chlorin. The mass is evaporated to dryness\r\nand gradually heated to a red heat. After cooling it is moistened with\r\nwater and washed into a beaker and the solid mass quickly separated. The\r\nclear liquid is poured off and the residue again washed with water. The\r\nclear liquid obtained is saturated with acetic acid, carefully\r\nevaporated to dryness and after solution in water, filtration and the\r\naddition of a little nitric acid, the chlorin therein is precipitated by\r\na silver nitrate solution, and the precipitate collected and weighed as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n=391. Method of Petermann.=[256]—Chlorin in the soil is estimated at the\r\nGembloux station by digesting 1,000 grams of the sample with two liters\r\nof distilled water with frequent shaking for thirty-six hours. After\r\nallowing to stand for twelve hours with the addition of one gram of\r\npowdered magnesium sulfate to facilitate the deposition of suspended\r\nmatter one liter of liquid is siphoned and evaporated in a platinum dish\r\nwith the addition of a few drops of a solution of potassium carbonate\r\nfree from chlorin and nitric acid. The concentrated solution is\r\nfiltered, washed, and made up to 250 cubic centimeters. Take 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the solution add some nitric acid and precipitate the\r\nchlorin with silver nitrate. The rest of the solution is reserved for\r\nthe estimation of nitrate.\r\n\r\n=392. Estimation of Silicic Acid.=—_Direct Estimation._—The sample of\r\nsoil in the method of Berthelot and André[257] is mixed with two or\r\nthree times its weight of pure sodium carbonate and fused in a silver\r\ncrucible until complete decomposition has taken place. The residue is\r\ndissolved in water and dilute hydrochloric acid. The silicates are\r\ndecomposed by this treatment and the solution is evaporated to dryness\r\non the water-bath, and when dry slightly heated. The silicic acid\r\n(silica) is by this treatment rendered insoluble. It is collected on a\r\nfilter, washed, ignited, and weighed. The resulting compound should be\r\nmixed with ammonium fluorid and sulfuric acid, and after the\r\ndisappearance of the silica the residue should be dried and weighed. The\r\nloss in weight represents the true silica. The loss in weight should be\r\ncorrected by calculating the sulfates of the alkalies back to oxids.\r\nThis correction can be neglected when the work has been carefully done,\r\nand the washing of the original silica has been well performed.\r\n\r\n_Indirect Estimation._—The total silica may be estimated indirectly by\r\nsubtracting from the total weight of the sample the sum of the weights\r\nof the other constituents resulting from the separate estimation of each\r\nof them after decomposing the sample with hydrofluoric acid.\r\n\r\n=393. Simultaneous Estimation of Different Elements.=—The operations and\r\nprocesses for the estimation of each of the elements have been\r\ndescribed, but it is often best to carry on an operation in such a way\r\nas to gain time by making a single decomposition upon a quantity of soil\r\nof some considerable magnitude, and using the results of the solution\r\nfor the determination of the different substances. From the operations\r\nalready described it will be easy to make a combination of methods by\r\nwhich all or nearly all the important constituents in a soil may be\r\ndetermined in a single sample. Of the various methods proposed, that of\r\nthe commission of the French agricultural chemists may be taken as a\r\ntype.[258] In the case of the estimation of lime, potash, magnesia, and\r\nsulfuric acid, in which the operation is carried on in a soil which is\r\nnot incinerated, time may be saved by digesting a considerable quantity\r\nof the soil with concentrated nitric acid for a period of five hours. It\r\nis best to take 100 grams of the soil and increase proportionally the\r\nnitric acid. The filtrate, after washing, is made up to one liter and\r\nthoroughly shaken. From this amount of liquid, portions are taken\r\ncorresponding to the weights of soil upon which the operation for the\r\ndetermination of each of the constituents would be conducted. For\r\nexample, for the estimation of lime in the case of a very calcareous\r\nearth, ten cubic centimeters representing one gram of the original\r\nsample, in the case of a soil poor in carbonates 100 cubic centimeters\r\nrepresenting ten grams, and for the estimation of potash, magnesia, and\r\nsulfuric acid 200 cubic centimeters, representing twenty grams of the\r\nsoil, should be taken. This method avoids frequent weighings of the\r\nearth and separate treatments thereof by the acid.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the same portion of the solution, the different\r\nelements can be estimated. For example, for the estimation of the potash\r\nas has been indicated, in the place of precipitating as a whole the\r\nsulfuric acid, lime, etc., and of afterwards separating the magnesia in\r\nthe sole aim of eliminating these bodies, they can be collected\r\nseparately and weighed, thus securing at a single operation several\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\nAt the end, some barium chlorid is added and if the barium sulfate is\r\nthen collected and weighed, the estimation of the sulfuric acid is\r\neffected. To the filtrate there are afterwards added some ammonia and\r\nammonium carbonate to precipitate, at once, the excess of barium and the\r\niron and aluminum oxids, the lime and the phosphoric acid. This\r\nseparation being effected the filtrate contains still the magnesia and\r\nthe alkalies. The first can be separated by carbonation by means of\r\noxalic acid, collected, and weighed. Finally the potash itself can be\r\nestimated in the state of perchlorate. It has thus been possible in the\r\nsame suite of operations to estimate in a given quantity of the liquid,\r\nthe sulfuric acid, the magnesia, the lime, and the potash.\r\n\r\n=394. Estimation of Kaolin in Soils.=—True kaolin is a hydrated aluminum\r\nsilicate, having the formula H₄Al₂Si₂O₉. This substance is, even in\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid, almost completely insoluble. It\r\ncontains, theoretically, 13.94 per cent of water of combination. The\r\nfollowing methods, due to Sachsse and Becker,[259] can be used for its\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Water of Combination._—Heat from one to two grams of\r\nkaolin, dried at 100°, for half an hour in a covered platinum crucible\r\nto a temperature which shows an incipient red heat when the crucible is\r\npartly protected from the daylight with the hand. This treatment does\r\nnot quite give the whole of the water of combination but nearly all of\r\nit. A kaolin is changed by this treatment into a substance which is\r\neasily soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Kaolin in Impure Kaolins._—Mineral kaolin, or the\r\nkaolin obtained by silt analysis, is dried at 100° to constant weight.\r\nIt is then heated with strong hydrochloric acid until all the matters\r\nwhich will pass into solution have been dissolved. The residual kaolin\r\nis then washed thoroughly with water and ignited for half an hour at a\r\nlow red heat. The residual mass is a second time extracted with\r\nhydrochloric acid until silica no longer passes into solution. The\r\nsoluble silica is then estimated in the usual way and calculated to\r\nkaolin. The result will give the pure kaolin in the sample examined.\r\n\r\nThe estimation may also be made as follows: Two samples of the impure\r\nkaolin are taken and dried to constant weight at 100°. One is extracted\r\nwith hydrochloric acid in the manner described above and the amount of\r\nsilica determined. The second is treated directly by ignition to low\r\nredness for half an hour, dissolved in hydrochloric acid and the amount\r\nof silica determined. The difference in the two percentages of silica\r\ncorresponds to the silica equivalent to the pure kaolin.\r\n\r\n_Statement of Results._—It is convenient to incorporate the data\r\nobtained by the above methods with the complete mass analysis of the\r\nsilicate examined. In the sample given below the analysis was made on a\r\nclay silt obtained with a velocity of two-tenths millimeter per second.\r\n\r\nThe mass analysis gave the following data:\r\n\r\n                         Loss on ignition 10.04\r\n                         SiO₂             51.52\r\n                         Al₂O₃            17.93\r\n                         Fe₂O₃             7.42\r\n                         CaO               1.57\r\n                         MgO               6.27\r\n                         K₂O               4.1\r\n                         Na₂O              1.61\r\n\r\nThe loss on ignition was made up of the combined water and a trace of\r\nhumus. On gentle ignition only 7.52 per cent of water came off.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the non-ignited and the gently ignited silica by\r\nmeans of dilute hydrochloric acid, gave the following data:\r\n\r\n                              Non-ignited.

Introductory Considerations.=—The great economic and biologic\r\nvalue of nitrogen as a plant food renders its estimation in soils of\r\nespecial importance. It is necessary, first of all, to remember that the\r\nnitrogen present in soils may be found in three forms; _viz._, first, in\r\norganic compounds, second, as ammonia, and third, as nitric or nitrous\r\nacid. Further than this each of these classes of nitrogen may be\r\nsubdivided. The organic nitrogen may be in a form easily nitrified and\r\nrendered available for plant food, or it may be inert and resistant to\r\nnitrification, as in humus, or exist in an amid state. The ammoniacal\r\nnitrogen may exist in small quantities as gaseous ammonia, or be\r\ncombined with mineral or organic acids. As nitric or nitrous acid the\r\nnitrogen will be found combined with bases, or perhaps in minute\r\nquantities as free acid, in passing under the influence of the\r\nnitrifying ferment from the organic to the inorganic state. To the\r\nlatter state it must finally come before it is suited to absorption by\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIn general, far the largest part of soil nitrogen, excluding the\r\natmosphere diffused in the pores of the soil, is found in the organic\r\nstate and is derived from the débris of animal and vegetable life and\r\nfrom added fertilizers. As ammonia, the nitrogen can only be regarded as\r\nin a transition state, arising from the processes of decay, or\r\nincomplete nitrification. As nitric acid, it is found as a completed\r\nproduct of nitrification, or as the result of electrical action. The\r\nprocesses of nitrification and the isolation and determination of the\r\nnitrifying organisms will be considered in a special chapter of this\r\nmanual. By reason of the great solubility of the nitrates, and the\r\ninability of the soil to retain them, there can never be a great\r\naccumulation of nitric acid in the soil save in localities deficient in\r\nrain-fall or in specially protected spots, such as caves. The nitric\r\nacid, therefore, produced in the soil passes at once into growing\r\nvegetation, or is found eventually in the drainage waters.\r\n\r\nThe formation of ammonia in soil containing much vegetable matter is\r\nthought by Berthelot and André[260] to be due to the progressive\r\ndecomposition of amid principles under the influence of dilute acids or\r\nalkalies, either in the cold or at an elevated temperature. Soils of the\r\nabove description, of themselves, contain neither free ammonia nor\r\nammoniacal salts, and the ammonia which is found in the analysis of\r\nthese soils comes from the reaction above indicated. The ammonia which\r\ncomes from these soils, in place of what is given off to the surrounding\r\natmosphere, comes from the same class of decompositions, and these\r\ndecompositions, in this case, are effected by the water itself, and by\r\nthe alkaline carbonates of the soil. The amid principles which are thus\r\ndecomposed belong either to the class of amids proper, derived by the\r\ndisplacement of hydrogen in ammonia by acids, or to the class of\r\nalkalamids derived from nitrogenous bases, both volatile and fixed.\r\nAmong these alkalamids some are soluble in water and some insoluble, and\r\nthe decomposition of these last by acids or by alkalies may furnish\r\nbodies which themselves are either soluble or insoluble in water.\r\n\r\nTo determine the nature of the nitrogenous principles in a soil rather\r\nrich in humus, Berthelot and André applied the following treatment:\r\n\r\nA soil containing 19.1 grams of carbon and 1.67 grams of nitrogen per\r\nkilogram was first subjected to treatment, at room temperature, with a\r\nconcentrated solution of potash. By this treatment 17.4 per cent of the\r\nnitrogen content was set free under the form of ammonia. One-quarter of\r\nthis was obtained during the first three days; one-eighth during the\r\nnext three days. Afterward the action became much more feeble and was\r\ncontinued during forty days longer, and the evolution of the gas was\r\ndiminished almost proportionately to the time. It appears from the above\r\nobservations that the amid principles of the soil, decomposable by\r\npotash, belong to two distinct groups, which are broken up with very\r\nunequal velocities. The soil, treated on the water-bath for three hours\r\nat 100° with strong potash, showed the following behavior in respect of\r\nits nitrogenous constituents: Nitrogen eliminated in the form of\r\nammonia, sixteen per cent; nitrogen remaining in the part soluble in\r\npotash, ten per cent; nitrogen remaining in the part insoluble in\r\npotash, seventy-four per cent.\r\n\r\n_Treatment with Acid._—The nitrogenous compounds of the soil are also\r\ndecomposed by dilute acids, and often more rapidly than by the alkalies.\r\nThe method of treatment is substantially the same as that set forth\r\nabove. The decompositions effected either by alkalies or by acids tend\r\nin general to lower the molecular weights of the resulting products. The\r\nprolonged action of alkalies at the temperature of boiling water\r\nrendered soluble, after twenty-four hours of treatment, 93.6 per cent of\r\nthe organic nitrogen found in the vegetable mould. By treating the earth\r\nsuccessively with alkalies and acids 95.5 per cent of the total nitrogen\r\nwere decomposed. These experiments show how the insoluble nitrogen in\r\nhumic compounds can be gradually rendered assimilable. The action of\r\nvegetables is not assuredly identical with those which acids and\r\nalkalies exercise. However, both present certain degrees of comparison\r\nfrom the point of view of the mechanisms set in play by the earthy\r\ncarbonates and carbon dioxid, as well as by the acids formed by\r\nvegetation. The reactions which take place naturally, while they are not\r\nso violent as those produced in the laboratory, make up by their\r\nduration what they lack in intensity.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed study of the nature of the nitrogenous elements in\r\nsoil the following method of treatment, due to Berthelot and André, is\r\nrecommended:\r\n\r\n_Treatment of the Soil with Alkalies._—1. Reaction with cold, dilute\r\nsolution of potash. Take fifty grams of the sample, dried at 110°, and\r\nmix with a large excess of ten per cent potash solution and place under\r\na bell-jar containing standard sulfuric acid. The mixture is left for a\r\nlong time in order to secure as fully as possible the ammonia set free.\r\n\r\nExample: Fifty grams of a soil contained 0.0814 gram of nitrogen.\r\nTreated as above it gave the following quantities of nitrogen as\r\nammonia:\r\n\r\n                                 Nitrogen as Ammonia.\r\n                After  3 days        0.0034        gram.\r\n                  „    6  „          0.0054          „\r\n                  „   11  „          0.0065          „\r\n                  „   17  „          0.0078          „\r\n                  „   25  „          0.0093          „\r\n                  „   41  „          0.0107          „\r\n                  „   46  „          0.0141          „\r\n\r\nIt is seen that the action still continued after forty days. In the\r\nspace of forty days 17.4 per cent of the total nitrogen contained in the\r\nsoil had been converted into ammonia by dilute potash. According to the\r\nabove observations the amid principles transformed into ammonia under\r\nthe influence of dilute potash, exist in groups which are acted on with\r\nvery unequal rapidity.\r\n\r\n2. Reaction with hot dilute solution of potash. Take 200 grams of the\r\nsoil sample, mix with one and one-half liters of dilute potash solution\r\ncontaining fifty grams of potash. Place in a flask and heat on boiling\r\nwater-bath for six hours. The flask is furnished with a stopper and\r\ntubes, and a current of pure hydrogen is made to pass through the\r\nliquid, having the double object of preventing any oxidizing effect from\r\nthe air and of carrying away the ammonia which may be formed. The\r\nescaping hydrogen and ammonia are passed into a bulb apparatus\r\ncontaining titrated sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe sample of soil employed contained in 200 grams, 0.3256 gram of\r\nnitrogen. There was obtained at the end of six hours’ heating, 0.0366\r\ngram of nitrogen. In other words, 11.24 per cent of the total nitrogen\r\nin the sample appeared as ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Examination of Residue._—After the separation of the ammonia as above\r\ndescribed, pour the residue in the flask on a filter, wash with hot\r\nwater, and determine nitrogen in filtrate and in solid matter on the\r\nfilter by combustion with soda-lime. The filtrate is, of course, first\r\nevaporated to dryness after being neutralized with sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble part contained 0.041 gram of nitrogen, _i. e._, 12.84 per\r\ncent of the entire amount.\r\n\r\nThe soluble part contained 0.2411 gram of nitrogen, _i. e._, 74.05 per\r\ncent of the whole.\r\n\r\n_Summary of Data._—In the sample analyzed the following data were\r\nobtained:\r\n\r\n                                           Of the whole.\r\n           Nitrogen as ammonia                11.24 per cent.\r\n              „     in insoluble part         12.84  „    „\r\n              „      „  soluble part          74.05  „    „\r\n              „     not determined             1.87  „    „\r\n                                             ——————\r\n                    Sum                      100.00  „    „\r\n\r\nThe same experiment in which the heating on the water-bath was continued\r\nfor thirteen hours gave the following data:\r\n\r\n                                           Of the whole.\r\n           Nitrogen as ammonia                16.03 per cent.\r\n              „     in insoluble part          9.98  „    „\r\n              „      „  soluble part          74.01  „    „\r\n                                             ——————\r\n                    Sum                      100.00  „    „\r\n\r\n_Further Treatment of Matter Insoluble in Hot Dilute Potash._—A portion\r\nof the insoluble portion from the last experiment was treated for\r\nthirteen hours longer under the same conditions with dilute hot potash.\r\nThe soluble and insoluble portions were determined as already described.\r\nOf the nitrogen insoluble after thirteen hours, 64.21 per cent remained\r\ninsoluble after the second thirteen hours. This fact shows that slow and\r\nprogressive decomposition of the alkalamids in the soil occurs under the\r\ninfluence of hot dilute potash.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Matter Insoluble in Hot Dilute Potash with Hydrochloric\r\nAcid._—A part of the material insoluble in hot potash after thirteen\r\nhours is mixed with dilute hydrochloric acid, in such proportion as to\r\nhave one-fifth the weight of pure hydrochloric acid to the dry solid\r\nmatter. Heat in flask on a boiling water-bath for thirteen hours.\r\nDetermine the nitrogen in the insoluble residue.\r\n\r\n_Example_: In the case given it was found that 54.91 per cent of the\r\nnitrogen insoluble in dilute hot potash were dissolved by the hot\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThis fact shows that insoluble nitrogen compounds contained in the soil\r\nare dissolved by dilute acids even more readily than by dilute alkalies\r\nat the temperature of boiling water.\r\n\r\nSeveral reactions appear to take place simultaneously when potash is\r\nbrought into contact with the nitrogenous principles of arable earth.\r\nSome of these principles, during the first period of the action become\r\nsoluble and even form compounds which are not precipitable by acids.\r\nWhen, however, the action of the potash is prolonged, the dissolved\r\nbodies lose little by little a part of their nitrogen as ammonia or as\r\nsoluble alkalamids. They become thus changed either to compounds no\r\nlonger soluble in the potash, or to those insoluble in the solution when\r\nacidified. These compounds, it is true, contain nitrogen, but are poorer\r\nin this element and have a higher molecular weight, or, in other words,\r\nare condensation products. These last principles are not absolutely\r\nstable in the presence of potash, but are decomposed much more slowly\r\nthan the original principles from which they were derived.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that under the influence of alkalies on the\r\nnitrogenous principles of the soil there is a tendency to form two\r\nclasses of bodies, the one more soluble with a lower molecular weight,\r\nthe other less soluble with a higher molecular weight. The inverse\r\nrelation between solubility and condensation is in agreement with what\r\nis observed in similar reactions with organic bodies in general. It\r\ncertainly plays an important rôle in the transformations which an arable\r\nsoil undergoes, either through the mild influences of the air and\r\nnatural waters, or the more energetic action of vegetables themselves.\r\n\r\nThe methods of estimating nitric nitrogen will be made the theme of a\r\nspecial study in connection with the chapter on nitrification. There\r\nwill be considered first, therefore, the methods of determining organic\r\nand ammoniacal nitrogen with only such incidental treatment of the\r\nmethods for nitric nitrogen as the processes applicable to the other\r\nforms may contain.\r\n\r\n=396. Provisional Methods of the Association of Official Agricultural\r\nChemists.=[261]—The nitrogen compounds in the soil are usually placed in\r\nthree classes.\r\n\r\n1. The nitrogen combined with oxygen as nitrates, or nitrites, existing\r\nas soluble salts in the soil.\r\n\r\n2. The nitrogen combined with hydrogen as ammonia, or organic nitrogen\r\neasily convertible into ammonia. The ammonia may exist as salts, or may\r\nbe occluded by hydrated ferric or aluminum oxids and organic matter in\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n3. The inert nitrogen of the soil or the humus nitrogen.\r\n\r\n_Active Soil Nitrogen._—The material proposed for reducing the nitrates\r\nto ammonia, and at the same time to bring ammonia salts and organic\r\nnitrogen into a condition for separation by distillation, is sodium\r\namalgam. Liquid sodium amalgam may be readily prepared by placing 100\r\ncubic centimeters of mercury in a flask of half a liter capacity,\r\ncovering the warmed mercury with melted paraffin, and dropping into the\r\nflask at short intervals pieces of metallic sodium, the size of a large\r\npea (taking care that the violence of the reaction does not project the\r\ncontents from the flask), till 6.75 grams of sodium have combined with\r\nthe mercury. The amalgam contains one-half per cent of sodium and may be\r\npreserved indefinitely under the covering of paraffin. To estimate the\r\nactive soil nitrogen, weigh fifty grams of air-dried soil and place it\r\nin a clean mortar. Take 200 cubic centimeters of ammonia-free distilled\r\nwater, rub up the soil with a part of the water to a smooth paste,\r\ntransfer this to a flask of one liter capacity, washing the last traces\r\nof the soil into the flask with the rest of the water. Add twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of the liquid sodium amalgam and shake the flask so as\r\nto break the sodium amalgam into small globules distributed through the\r\nsoil. Insert a stopper with a valve and set aside in a cool place for\r\ntwenty-four hours. Pour into the flask fifty cubic centimeters of milk\r\nof lime, and distill, on a sand-bath, 100 cubic centimeters into a flask\r\ncontaining twenty cubic centimeters of decinormal sulfuric acid, and\r\ntitrate with decinormal soda solution, using dimethyl-orange as\r\nindicator. Estimate the nitrogen of the ammonia found as active soil\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nIf the ammonia produced is too small in amount to be readily estimated\r\nvolumetrically, determine the ammonia by nesslerizing the distillate.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Nitrates in the Soil._—When it is desired to estimate\r\nseparately the nitrates in the soil the following method may be used:\r\nEvaporate 100 cubic centimeters of the soil extract to dryness on the\r\nwater-bath, dissolve the soluble portion, of the residue in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonia-free distilled water, filtering out any insoluble\r\nresidue, place the solution in a flask and add ten cubic centimeters of\r\nliquid sodium amalgam, insert stopper with valve, set it aside to digest\r\nin a cool place for twenty-four hours, add fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nmilk of lime, distill and titrate as above, and estimate the nitrogen as\r\nN₂O₅.\r\n\r\nNesslerizing may be substituted for titration when the amount of\r\nnitrates is small.\r\n\r\nAn approximate estimation of the amount of nitrates will be of value in\r\ndetermining which method of estimation to use. This may be done by\r\nevaporating a measured quantity of the soil extract, say five cubic\r\ncentimeters, on a porcelain crucible cover on a steam-bath or radiator,\r\nhaving first dissolved a minute fragment of pure brucin sulfate in the\r\nsoil extract. When dry pour over the residue concentrated sulfuric acid,\r\nfree from nitrates, and observe the color reactions produced.\r\n\r\nIf the nitrate (reckoned as KNO₃) left upon evaporating the quantity of\r\nwater taken does not exceed the two-thousandth part of a milligram, only\r\na pink color will be developed by adding the sulfuric acid; with the\r\nthree-thousandth part of a milligram, a pink with faint reddish lines;\r\nwith the four-thousandth part, a reddish color; with the five-thousandth\r\npart, a red color.\r\n\r\nBy increasing or diminishing the amount of soil extract evaporated to\r\nsecure a color reaction of a certain intensity, an approximate estimate\r\nmay be made of the amount of nitrates present.\r\n\r\nBlank experiments to test the acid and the brucin sulfate will be\r\nrequired before confidence can be placed in such estimations.\r\n\r\n_Total Nitrogen of Soils._—The total nitrogen of soils may be determined\r\nby the usual combustion with soda-lime, but this process is often\r\nunsatisfactory because of the large amount of material required when the\r\norganic matter or humus is small in amount.\r\n\r\nA modification of the kjeldahl method is more easy to carry out and\r\ngives results equally satisfactory. Place twenty grams of soil in a\r\nkjeldahl flask, and add twenty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid (free\r\nfrom ammonia) holding in solution one gram of salicylic acid. If the\r\nsoil contain much lime or magnesia in the form of carbonate, enough more\r\nsulfuric acid must be added to secure a strongly acid condition of the\r\ncontents of the flask. Add gradually two grams of zinc dust, shaking the\r\ncontents of the flask to secure intimate mixture. Place the flask in a\r\nsand-bath and heat till the acid boils, and maintain the boiling for ten\r\nminutes. Add one gram of mercury and continue the boiling for one hour,\r\nadding ten cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid if the contents of the\r\nflask are likely to become solid. Cool the flask and wash out the\r\nsoluble materials with 200 cubic centimeters of pure water, leaving the\r\nheavy earthy materials. Rinse the residue with 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater, and add this to the first washings. Place this soluble acid\r\nextract in a liter digestion flask, add thirty-five cubic centimeters of\r\na solution of potassium sulfid, and shake the flask to secure intimate\r\nmixture of the contents. Introduce a few fragments of granulated zinc,\r\npour in seventy-five cubic centimeters of a saturated solution of\r\ncaustic soda, connect the flask with a condenser and distill 150 cubic\r\ncentimeters into a flask containing twenty cubic centimeters of acid,\r\nusing the same acid and alkali for titration used in the kjeldahl method\r\nunder fertilizers.\r\n\r\nEnter the nitrogen found in this operation as total soil nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the total soil nitrogen and the active soil\r\nnitrogen will express the inert nitrogen of the soil.\r\n\r\n=397. Hilgard’s Method.=[262]—The humus determination will, in the case\r\nof virgin soils, usually indicate approximately the store of nitrogen in\r\nthe soil, which must be gradually made available by nitrification.\r\nOrdinarily (outside of the arid regions) the determination of ammonia\r\nand nitrates present in the soil is of little interest for general\r\npurposes, since these factors will vary with the season and from day to\r\nday. Kedzie proposes to estimate the active soil nitrogen (ammonia plus\r\nnitrates and nitrites) by treatment of the whole soil with sodium\r\namalgam and distillation with lime. The objection to this process is\r\nthat the formation of ammonia by the reaction of the alkali and lime\r\nupon the humus amids would greatly exaggerate the active nitrogen and\r\nlead to a serious overestimate of the soil’s immediate resources.\r\n\r\nThe usual content of nitrogen in black soil-humus is from six to eight\r\nper cent in the regions of summer rains. From late determinations it\r\nwould seem that in the arid regions the usually small amount of humus\r\n(often less than two-tenths per cent) is materially compensated by a\r\nhigher nitrogen percentage. It thus becomes necessary to determine the\r\nhumus nitrogen directly; and this is easily done by substituting in the\r\ngrandeau process of humus extraction potash or soda-lye for ammonia\r\nwater, and determining the nitrogen by the kjeldahl method in the\r\nfiltrate.\r\n\r\nThe lye used should have the strength of four per cent in the case of\r\npotassium hydroxid, three per cent in that of sodium hydroxid. The black\r\nhumus filtrate is carefully neutralized with sulfuric acid, evaporated\r\nto a small bulk in a beaker or evaporating basin, and the reduced liquid\r\nfinally evaporated to dryness in the kjeldahl flask itself by means of a\r\ncurrent of air. The beaker or basin is washed either with some of the\r\nalkaline lye, or, after evaporation, with warm concentrated sulfuric\r\nacid, which is then used in the nitrogen determination in the usual way.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of nitrates in the soil it is, of course, usually\r\nnecessary to use large amounts of material, say not less than 100 grams,\r\nand, according to circumstances, five or more times that amount. In the\r\nevaporated solution the nitric acid is best determined by the reduction\r\nmethod, as ammonia.\r\n\r\nUsually the soil filtrate is clear and contains no appreciable amount of\r\norganic matter that would interfere with the determination; yet in the\r\ncase of alkaline soils (impregnated with sodium carbonate) a very dark\r\ncolored solution may be obtained. In that case the soil may\r\nadvantageously be mixed with a few per cent of powdered gypsum before\r\nleaching; or the gypsum may be used in the filtrate to discolor it by\r\nthe decomposition of sodium carbonate and the precipitation of calcium\r\nhumate. The evaporated filtrate can then be used for the nitrate\r\ndetermination by either the kjeldahl, griess, or the nessler process,\r\nwhich will, of course, include such portions of the ammoniacal salts as\r\nmay have been leached out.\r\n\r\nFor the separate determination of these and of the occluded ammonia,\r\nwhen desired, it is probably best to mix the wetted soil intimately with\r\nabout ten per cent of magnesium oxid and distill into titrated\r\nhydrochloric acid. For general purposes, however, this determination is\r\nusually of little interest.\r\n\r\n=398. Müller’s Modified Kjeldahl Method.=—Numerous difficulties, as\r\nstated by Müller,[263] have attended the attempts to apply the kjeldahl\r\nmethod for the estimation of nitrogen to samples of soil, and he has\r\nmodified the method to some extent and made comparisons of the quantity\r\nof nitrogen by this modified method and by the soda-lime method.\r\n\r\nThe principal difficulty encountered by him has been in the regular\r\nheating of the mixture of fuming sulfuric acid and soil. The particles\r\nof soil are deposited at the bottom of the flask and the result is that\r\nthe bottom layers become overheated, and, being poor conductors of heat,\r\nfail to transmit a sufficient quantity of heat to penetrate to the upper\r\nlayers of the liquid to complete the reaction. In order to avoid this\r\ndifficulty Müller heats his flask in a small stove formed with a\r\nstraight vertical cylinder of iron or copper, the upper end of which is\r\ncovered with a sheet of iron pierced with a hole which allows the neck\r\nof the flask to pass through, while the lower end is closed with a piece\r\nof sheet iron furnished on its upper surface with a layer of asbestos.\r\nThis cylinder of metal is surrounded with a second one, concentric with\r\nthe first through which passes a current of heated gases furnished by an\r\nordinary bunsen. By heating the flask in this stove or furnace an even\r\ndistribution of the heat is secured to all parts of the mixture, but the\r\nlittle drops of sulfuric acid, which are condensed on the cold part of\r\nthe neck, sometimes lead to the fracture of the glass as they run down\r\nthe sides of the flask to the hot portions. To prevent the reflux of\r\nthis condensed acid, which only needs to be done near the end of the\r\nreaction, when it is necessary to heat to a very high temperature, the\r\nneck of the flask is bent at the point immediately above its emergence\r\nat the upper surface of the furnace, and carried into a flask of about\r\nseventy-five cubic centimeters capacity, which will receive the drops of\r\nsulfuric acid condensed during the operation. The furnace has the\r\nfollowing dimensions; height, twelve centimeters; diameter of interior\r\ncylinder, five and one-half centimeters; diameter of exterior cylinder,\r\nseven and one-half centimeters.\r\n\r\nIt is supported on a triangle of large iron wire and is heated by an\r\nordinary bunsen, or by a concentric bunsen, according to the temperature\r\nwhich it is necessary to obtain. The proportions which should be\r\nobserved between the amount of earth employed and the sulfuric acid are\r\nabout as follows:\r\n\r\nOf the dry earth, fifteen grams; of the fuming sulfuric acid, thirty\r\ncubic centimeters. There should also be added to the mixture about\r\nthree-tenths of a gram of pure stearic acid, or better, benzoic acid.\r\nWhen the soil to be analyzed does not contain carbonate, the sulfuric\r\nacid should be added in two portions. At first add about twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the acid, and after shaking it, the other ten cubic\r\ncentimeters, running it in from a burette or a pipette in such a manner\r\nas to wash thoroughly the neck and sides of the flask. If the earth\r\ncontain carbonate, however, it is necessary to add the fuming acid in\r\nsmall portions of about five cubic centimeters at a time, waiting each\r\ntime until the disengagement of the gas caused by the previous addition\r\nhas ceased. A soil which contains from thirty to forty per cent of\r\ncalcium carbonate should be carefully treated in a porcelain capsule\r\nwith a slight excess of sulfuric acid, pure and dilute. The mixture is\r\nafterward to be evaporated to dryness upon a sand-bath and the residue\r\nheated in a drying oven to 110°. The mass is then pulverized, introduced\r\ninto the flask, treated with three-tenths of a gram of benzoic acid and\r\nthirty cubic centimeters of fuming sulfuric acid, and treated as\r\nindicated above. In all cases it is necessary to continue the heating\r\nuntil the contents of the flask are colorless.\r\n\r\nWith soils containing considerable quantities of iron, however, a slight\r\nred color will probably be observed which will not interfere with the\r\naccuracy of the tests.\r\n\r\nThe heating should at first be gentle and the temperature afterward\r\nelevated little by little, and finally the heat should be sufficiently\r\ngreat to distill about one and one-half cubic centimeters of sulfuric\r\nacid. The operation lasts from twelve to thirteen hours. As the reaction\r\nis terminated the cooled mass is taken up with water absolutely free\r\nfrom ammonia. It is filtered into a flask, and washed upon the filter\r\nuntil the volume of the filtered liquid is about 350 cubic centimeters.\r\nAfterward an excess of soda-lye, at 50° baumé is added, then a few\r\npieces of quartz to facilitate boiling. The flask is then connected with\r\na condenser, the liquid distilled and received in a conical flask closed\r\nby a cork having two holes, of which one permits the entrance of the end\r\nof the condenser, and the other a glass tube which is connected with a\r\nsmall flask containing water, the neck of the receiving flask being\r\ninclined toward the condenser to avoid the entrainment of any of the\r\nalkaline liquid which may be distilled. The receiving flask rests upon\r\ntwo or three pieces of sheet iron and is heated with an ordinary burner,\r\nand ebullition is perfectly regular. From 170 to 180 cubic centimeters\r\nof the liquid are distilled in from three and one-half to four hours.\r\nThe distilled liquid, treated with a few drops of litmus, is titrated by\r\na solution of sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, of which one cubic\r\ncentimeter corresponds to 0.001 cubic centimeter of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n=399. Modification of the Kjeldahl Method by Arnold and\r\nWedemeyer.=[264]—For the oxidizing liquid a mixture of three grams of\r\nbenzoic acid with forty cubic centimeters of H₂SO₄ is employed. After\r\nplacing in the digestion flask with the nitrogenous body the whole is\r\ngently shaken for a few minutes to prevent clotting. The temperature is\r\nthen raised until acid vapors begin to come off, when one gram of copper\r\nsulfate and one gram of mercuric oxid are added; and after ten to\r\nfifteen minutes, to avoid foaming, ten to twenty grams of potassium\r\nsulfate. The sublimate noticed on the walls of the flask is benzoic acid\r\nand does not interfere with the accuracy of the determination.\r\n\r\nThis method has given good results with the alkaline nitrates, the\r\nnitrates of barium, mercury, silver, lead, and with strychnia, ammonia,\r\npyridin, azobenzol, dinitrobenzol, and picric acid.\r\n\r\n=400. Prevention of Bumping During Distillation.=—Daffert has employed\r\nthe modified kjeldahl method, but found considerable difficulty in using\r\nthe same owing to the violent bumping of the liquid in the distillation.\r\nThis was especially the case where the sample contained a large\r\nproportion of sand. To overcome this annoyance and danger he devised the\r\nfollowing process:[265]\r\n\r\nFit into the mouth of a large-mouthed distillation flask a stopper\r\nhaving two perforations. Through one of the perforations pass the usual\r\ndistillation tube, through the other a similar tube connected with a\r\nsupply of steam. Bring the contents to a brisk boil, after which a small\r\ncurrent of steam is turned on, allowing the same to pass in a small\r\nstream throughout the distillation. By this means, not only is all\r\ndanger from bumping avoided, but the time required for the distillation\r\nshortened. By the old method it usually requires from fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes, whereas the former requires from six to ten minutes.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to filter all samples of soils having a large proportion\r\nof sand.\r\n\r\n=401. Determination of Organic Nitrogen by the Soda-Lime Method.=—In the\r\ndescription of the method following, the directions of the French\r\nCommission of Agricultural Chemists have been taken as the basis of the\r\nanalytical process.[266] This method is, in this country, almost\r\nsuperseded by the moist combustion process with sulfuric acid. By reason\r\nof its long use, however, and because it is still regarded as the best\r\nmethod by the agricultural chemists of France, Italy, and England, it\r\nmerits a full description. It is recommended also by Berthelot and\r\nAndré,[267] by the International Congress of Chemists, held in Paris in\r\n1889, by the Italian chemists, and by the official Belgian method,[268]\r\nin all cases where nitrates are not present in notable quantities.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen which is found in soils in the organic state is transformed\r\ninto ammonia when it is heated with soda-lime. This reaction is the base\r\nof the process of analysis which has so long been used for this class of\r\nbodies. The analytical process is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nA well-cleaned glass combustion tube, closed at one end, is used. The\r\nlength of the tube is from thirty-five to forty centimeters. It is\r\nfilled first to a depth of two centimeters with calcium oxalate;\r\nafterwards to a depth of five centimeters with soda-lime in small\r\nfragments; afterwards with the mixture to be analyzed; _viz._, of ten\r\ngrams of the sample of soil, or twenty grams if poor in nitrogen and\r\norganic matters, with soda-lime reduced to a coarse powder. This mixture\r\nshould occupy a length of about twenty centimeters in the tube. The soil\r\nand soda-lime are mixed in a mortar. Afterwards the mortar is rubbed\r\nwith small quantities of soda-lime, and this, together with the copper\r\nboat which has been used in introducing the mixture, is thoroughly\r\nwashed with the soda-lime, which is poured into the tube until it is\r\nfilled to within four centimeters of its open extremity. The open end of\r\nthe tube is then closed with a wad of asbestos packed sufficiently tight\r\nto prevent the carrying off of the soda-lime by the gas which may be\r\ngenerated during the combustion. The combustion should be commenced by\r\nheating the tube near the open extremity until it is red and carrying\r\nthe heat progressively towards the part containing the soil mixed with\r\nthe soda-lime. An ordinary gas combustion furnace should be used and the\r\nheat graduated in such a way that the bubbles of gas pass off regularly\r\nand not too rapidly. The gas is conducted into a bulb tube containing a\r\ndecinormal standard sulfuric acid colored with litmus. The combustion is\r\ncontinued until the whole of the organic material is decomposed, care\r\nbeing taken not to raise the combustion tube above a low redness in\r\norder to avoid its softening. At the end, however, the temperature of\r\nthe combustion tube should be raised to a bright red, and the part\r\ncontaining the calcium oxalate should be heated little by little for the\r\npurpose of evolving hydrogen, which is used to drive out the last traces\r\nof ammonia. After the combustion is completed, and the last traces of\r\nammonia driven out, the standard acid which has received the evolved\r\nammonia is removed, the tube leading to it washed, the wash-water\r\ncollected with the rest of the liquid and titrated with a standard\r\nsolution of lime-water, the strength of which has previously been\r\ndetermined against standard sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n=402. Preparation of the Standard Sulfuric Acid.=—The sulfuric acid to\r\nbe used in making the standard solutions should be previously boiled for\r\nhalf an hour in a platinum dish and allowed to cool in a desiccator. It\r\nshould contain 61.25 grams of sulfuric acid in one liter. It is\r\nrecommended that the flask which holds the sulfuric acid should be one\r\nwhich has been used for a long time for holding concentrated sulfuric\r\nacid, in order to avoid any action of the alkali in the glass upon the\r\nacid after its strength has been determined. The solution before\r\ndescribed is of such strength as to have each cubic centimeter\r\nequivalent to one milligram of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nFor the estimation of the nitrogen in the soil a tenth normal solution\r\nshould be used, which is prepared by taking 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\nnormal solution, described above, and diluting to one liter.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Lime-Water._—From 200 to 300 grams of slaked lime\r\nare placed in a closed flask of about five liters capacity. This is\r\nfilled with water and shaken frequently, and left to deposit the matter\r\nin suspension. The water which contains the saline particles which may\r\nhave been present in the lime is then poured off. Fresh water is then\r\npoured on and the flask shaken from time to time. To use this lime-water\r\nthe clear part of it is decanted into a flask, avoiding, as much as\r\npossible, access to the air. The flask is closed with a cork carrying\r\ntwo tubes drawn out and bent at a right angle. One of these serves for\r\npouring off the water and the other serves for the entrance of the air.\r\nThese two tubes are themselves closed by means of a rubber tube carrying\r\na pinch-cock. The strength of the lime-water is fixed by titration with\r\nthe decinormal standard sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Soda-Lime._—Six hundred grams of slaked lime in fine\r\npowder are saturated with 300 grams of caustic soda dissolved in 300\r\ncubic centimeters of water. The whole is rubbed into a paste and\r\nintroduced into a crucible which is heated to redness. The contents of\r\nthe crucible, still hot, are poured out, and rapidly reduced to\r\nfragments in a copper mortar in such a manner as to have the pieces\r\nabout the size of a pea, and without having too much finely powdered\r\nsoda-lime mixed with it. While the matter is still hot it is placed in a\r\nflask and well-stoppered. In order that this reagent should contain no\r\nnitrogen it is indispensable to use in its preparation materials which\r\ncontain no trace of nitrates.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Calcium Oxalate._—In a small copper vessel place 100\r\ngrams of oxalic acid and add gradually, bringing it to boiling, enough\r\nwater to dissolve it. Afterwards place in the solution small portions of\r\nslaked lime in a state of powder, constantly testing it until turmeric\r\npaper indicates that there is a little lime in excess. It is then\r\nevaporated, stirring vigorously on the open fire, and the evaporation is\r\nfinally finished on a steam-bath. The dried material is placed in a\r\nflask and well-stoppered. The oxalic acid which is used in this\r\npreparation should be free from every trace of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Litmus Solution._—Five grams of litmus are placed in\r\na flask with a flat bottom. Afterwards a few cubic centimeters of\r\nammonia are added, twenty five grams of crystallized sodium carbonate,\r\nand ten cubic centimeters of water. This mixture is left to digest for\r\nsometime, with frequent stirring, at a temperature of from 60°–80°. The\r\ndigestion is finished in about four or five days, during which time, at\r\nintervals, a few drops of ammonia are added, sufficient to maintain\r\nalways the ammoniacal odor. At the end of this time 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water are added and the digestion allowed to continue\r\nseveral days more, still maintaining the solution alkaline with ammonia.\r\nA slight excess of hydrochloric acid is added, and the matter which is\r\nprecipitated is received upon a filter where it is washed several times\r\nwith cold water and allowed to dry at a low temperature.\r\n\r\nFor use, from one to two grams of this dry precipitate are dissolved in\r\n100 cubic centimeters of alcohol, and there is thus obtained a litmus\r\nsolution of extreme sensibility.\r\n\r\n=403. Treatment of Soil Containing Nitrates.=—Nitrates exist in small\r\nquantities in all arable soils. When treated for nitrogen by the\r\nsoda-lime method above described, a part of the nitric nitrogen is\r\nchanged to the state of ammonia, while another part escapes estimation\r\naltogether, causing an error which it is important to point out. When\r\nthe soils contain only small quantities of nitrates this error is\r\ninsignificant and does not affect sensibly the results, but in the case\r\nof earths rich in nitrates it is necessary first to eliminate them\r\nbefore the determination of the nitrogen by the soda-lime method. The\r\noperation is carried on as follows:\r\n\r\nTwenty grams of the soil are washed on a small funnel, furnished with a\r\nplug of asbestos, with small quantities of pure water, in such a way as\r\nto cause thirty to forty cubic centimeters of water to pass through. The\r\nwhole of the nitrate is thus removed. The soil is now dried and\r\nsubmitted to analysis by the soda-lime method as just described. There\r\nare removed with the nitrate only small traces of organic nitrogen, too\r\nsmall to influence the results of the analysis. If, however, it is\r\ndesired to remove altogether this slight cause of error, evaporate the\r\nwash-waters, above described, to two or three cubic centimeters; add a\r\nfew drops of a concentrated solution of ferrous chlorid and as much\r\nhydrochloric acid, and boil some minutes in order to drive off, in the\r\nstate of nitrogen dioxid, all the nitric acid. The residue is evaporated\r\nto dryness and contains the traces of organic nitrogen. This is added to\r\nthe soil which is to be treated by the soda-lime method.\r\n\r\n=404. Müller’s Method.=—The determination of nitrogen in the soil by\r\nsoda-lime is carried on as follows by Müller:[269]\r\n\r\nFifteen grams of fine earth, dried and mixed with a little sugar, are\r\nmixed with thirty grams of soda-lime in powder. The bottom of the\r\ncombustion tube contains a little moist soda-lime, which is heated at\r\nthe end of the operation at the same time that a current of pure\r\nhydrogen is made to pass through it, and the temperature of the tube is\r\nraised, little by little, to a distinct redness. The contents of the\r\nreceiving bulbs are distilled, after the addition of water and soda, in\r\nthe same apparatus which served in the estimation of nitrogen, by the\r\nkjeldahl method; the determinations and titrations are made also under\r\nthe same conditions.\r\n\r\nBlank determinations are also made under the same conditions to\r\ndetermine the amount of correction to be made by the two methods.\r\nSoda-lime, heated with pure sugar, gave 0.0002 gram of nitrogen for a\r\ntotal weight of fifty-five grams of the soda-lime contained in the tube.\r\nThe fuming sulfuric acid gave 0.0011 cubic centimeters of ammoniacal\r\nnitrogen for the volume of thirty cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe numbers obtained by the kjeldahl method in general, are lower than\r\nthose obtained by the soda-lime method when no stearic or benzoic acid\r\nis used. The numbers obtained when stearic acid alone was used were\r\nsometimes inferior to those obtained by the soda-lime method. The\r\nnumbers obtained when benzoic acid is used are, in general, about the\r\nsame as those obtained by the soda-lime method.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the double distillation, outlined above, for the\r\nkjeldahl method, would not be necessary if due care were exercised in\r\nthe first distillation. This variation, therefore, seems to be\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn the soda-lime method, time would be saved by the reception of the\r\nammonia in standard acid, and its titration in the usual way, unless a\r\nfurther purification of the nitrogenous products of the combustion by\r\nthe final distillation be desired.\r\n\r\n=405. Volumetric Determination of the Nitrogen.=—Instead of separating\r\nthe nitrates, the total nitrogen in the soil can be determined directly\r\nby the classic method of Dumas, which consists in bringing the whole of\r\nthe nitrogen into a gaseous state and afterwards measuring its volume.\r\n\r\nThe following method illustrates the general principles of the\r\ndetermination:\r\n\r\nA glass combustion tube closed at one end, about one meter in length, is\r\nselected. In the bottom of this tube is placed some potassium\r\nbicarbonate in a crystalline form, in small pieces, filling the tube to\r\na distance of about twenty centimeters. Afterwards copper oxid is placed\r\nto the depth of ten centimeters and finally a mixture of from twenty to\r\nthirty grams of the earth with thirty to forty grams of copper oxid in a\r\nfine state of subdivision, and about ten grams of metallic copper\r\nobtained by reducing the copper oxid by hydrogen. Next the tube is\r\nfilled with copper oxid to a depth of from twenty to twenty-five\r\ncentimeters, and afterwards with reduced copper to the depth of at least\r\ntwenty-five centimeters, and after this another layer of copper oxid of\r\nabout five centimeters, and finally a plug of asbestos. The combustion\r\ntube is closed with a stopper carrying a glass tube of about ninety\r\ncentimeters in length, of which the extremity, bent into the form of a\r\n=ᥩ=, extends to a mercury trough. The glass combustion tube is\r\nsurrounded with brass gauze, except that part which contains the\r\npotassium bicarbonate. The beginning of the operation consists in\r\nheating the tube to decompose a part of the potassium bicarbonate, until\r\nthe whole of the apparatus is filled with carbon dioxid. In order to\r\ndetermine that the whole of the air has been expelled and that the\r\napparatus is entirely filled with carbon dioxid, a part of the gas which\r\nis disengaged, is received into a jar filled with mercury, in which a\r\nlittle potash-lye has been placed. If the gas is entirely absorbed by\r\nthe potash, so that there remain only unappreciable particles, the tube\r\ncan be regarded as completely free of air. When assurance is given that\r\nthe air is all out of the apparatus, a jar of about 300 cubic\r\ncentimeters capacity, filled with mercury and containing from thirty to\r\nforty cubic centimeters of a solution of potash of a density of 42°\r\nbaumé, is placed over the outlet tube. The combustion is commenced by\r\nheating the anterior part of the tube, avoiding the heating of the part\r\ncontaining the earth. When the first part of the tube has reached the\r\nred stage the part containing the earth is gradually heated in order to\r\nobtain a gentle evolution of gas. The temperature of the tube is carried\r\nto redness and the heating gradually carried back toward the closed\r\nextremity, but avoiding raising the temperature of the part containing\r\nthe potassium bicarbonate. The red heat is continued as long as bubbles\r\nof gas are discharged into the reservoir. When the evolution of gas has\r\nceased the apparatus is again filled with carbon dioxid for the purpose\r\nof driving out the last traces of nitrogen, by heating again the part of\r\nthe tube containing the potassium bicarbonate. The evolution of the\r\ncarbon dioxid should be maintained for about fifteen minutes. At the end\r\nof this time all the nitrogen will be found in the receiving jar.\r\nSometimes a small quantity of nitrogen dioxid is formed incidentally in\r\nthe operation. After waiting for a quarter of an hour, in order to\r\npermit all the carbon dioxid which may have escaped into the reservoir\r\nto be completely absorbed, the receiving jar is carried to a water-basin\r\nand the mercury allowed gradually to escape; its place being taken by\r\nthe water. The gas is then transferred into an azotometer where its\r\nvolume and temperature are read in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIn order to absorb any nitrogen dioxid which may be admixed with the\r\nnitrogen itself, a little crystal of ferrous sulfate is introduced. The\r\nreservoir containing the nitrogen is carried to the mercury trough, and\r\nthe water which it contains is nearly all run out in such a way as to be\r\nreplaced with mercury, great care being exercised to avoid any escape of\r\ngas. Afterwards there is introduced over the mercury a crystal of\r\nferrous sulfate and the azotometer is shaken until this crystal is\r\ndissolved by the water which it still contains. It is then allowed to\r\nremain for twenty hours. At the end of this time the nitrogen dioxid is\r\nabsorbed and the volume of the gas is again read as before. One-half\r\nonly of the total loss should be subtracted, since the volume of the\r\nnitrogen dioxid is twice the volume of the nitrogen itself. For the\r\npractice of this method, in connection with the use of a mercury pump,\r\nthe directions which will be given under fertilizers may be consulted.\r\n\r\n=406. Estimation of Ammonia.=—Ammonia exists ordinarily only in very\r\nsmall quantities in the soil, since it is incessantly transformed into\r\nnitrate or diffused in the air. Nevertheless, it is sometimes\r\ninteresting to determine its quantity.\r\n\r\nThe method of determining the ammonia in soils is one of extreme\r\ndelicacy on account of the small proportion therein, and the difficulty\r\nof expelling it without at the same time converting some of the organic\r\nnitrogen into ammoniacal compounds. The various methods employed for\r\nthis purpose may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Treatment of the soil with soda-lye in the cold, and the absorption\r\nof the ammonia given off by standard sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n2. The method of Boussingault, which consists in replacing the soda-lye\r\nwith magnesia and distilling the ammonia at a boiling temperature,\r\nabsorbing the distillate in a standard acid.\r\n\r\n3. A modification of the above method, due to Schloesing, which consists\r\nfirst in extracting the ammonia by hydrochloric acid and subjecting the\r\nextract to distillation with magnesia.\r\n\r\n4. The method of Knop consists in treating the soil in a closed cylinder\r\nwith soda-lye containing bromin. The ammonia set free by the lye is\r\ndecomposed in the presence of bromin into free nitrogen and hydrochloric\r\nacid. The nitrogen is collected and measured in an azotometer. The\r\nbrom-soda-lye is prepared by dissolving 100 grams of sodium hydroxid in\r\n1,200 cubic centimeters of water and adding twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of bromin.\r\n\r\n5. The process described under 4, as shown by Baumann,[270] does not\r\ngive accurate results and it has been modified by him as follows: Two\r\nhundred grams of soil are treated with 100 cubic centimeters of dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid (one part acid and four of water) free of ammonia; 300\r\ncubic centimeters of ammonia-free distilled water are added and the\r\nwhole digested for two hours with frequent stirring. If a soil contain\r\nmuch calcium carbonate larger quantities of acid must be used. Two\r\nhundred cubic centimeters of the filtrate are placed in an evolution\r\nflask, connected with an azotometer, with five grams of freshly burned\r\nmagnesia. The mixture is then oxidized as follows: Ozone is generated by\r\nadding three parts by weight of sulfuric acid to one part of dry and\r\npowdered potassium permanganate. A stream of air is drawn through the\r\nozone generator by an aspirator, and the ozone is conducted into a flask\r\ncontaining the hydrochloric acid extract of the soil and magnesia. The\r\noxidation is completed in about ten minutes. The mixture is then brought\r\ninto the evolution flask of the azotometer and the nitrogen set free and\r\nmeasured in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that if asparagin or glutamin be present in the soil\r\nthey are decomposed by the soda-lye and the results obtained are too\r\nhigh. It has been further proved that soils which contain a notable\r\nquantity of humus give, with soda-lye in the cold, a practically\r\ncontinuous evolution of ammonia. Moreover, soils which are rich in humus\r\nand which have been treated by distillation with magnesia give, on\r\nsubsequent treatment with soda-lye, considerable additional quantities\r\nof ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Comparison of Methods of Estimating Ammonia._—Baumann has determined\r\nthe ammonia-nitrogen in various soils by the soda-lime method;\r\ndistillation of the hydrochloric acid extract with magnesia, and the\r\nazotometric method modified as indicated above. These methods will be\r\ndesignated as 1, 2, 3, respectively in the following table.\r\n\r\n                                        METHOD.\r\n                                  1.      2.      3.\r\n                                Ammonia-nitrogen in one\r\n                                   kilogram of soil.\r\n                                 ——————  ——————  ——————\r\n                 No. of sample.

The Magnesia Distillation Process.=—If a sample of soil be\r\ndistilled directly with magnesia and water, there is danger on the one\r\nside of not extracting all the ammonia, by reason of the absorbing power\r\nof these bodies, and on the other, of transforming into ammonia the\r\nnitrogen of the organic matters. It is therefore preferable to separate\r\nthe ammonia from the soil in the form of chlorid, and to subject this\r\nextract to distillation.\r\n\r\nIn fifty grams of the soil the humidity is determined by drying at 100°\r\nuntil there is no further loss of weight. The quantity of moisture being\r\nknown, 200 grams of soil are taken and moistened with water, and then\r\nthere is added, in small portions, some dilute hydrochloric acid,\r\nshaking frequently until the whole of the calcium carbonate present is\r\ndecomposed. The liquor should remain acid at the end of the operation,\r\nbut without containing a notable excess of acidity. Knowing beforehand\r\nthe quantity of moisture contained in the 200 grams, water is added\r\nuntil the total quantity shall be equal to 500 cubic centimeters. The\r\nwhole is then shaken and allowed to repose, and filtered rapidly,\r\ncovering the funnel with a glass vessel and receiving the liquid which\r\nruns through in a flask with a narrow opening. Two hundred and fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of this liquor, or mixture, represent 100 grams of\r\nearth of known humidity. This quantity is introduced into a flask for\r\ndetermining the ammonia and five grams of calcined magnesia added.\r\nBefore commencing the distillation, assurance should be had that the\r\nmagnesia has completely saturated the acid in excess, and that the\r\nliquor is alkaline.\r\n\r\nIf, by chance, the liquor should be still acid it would be necessary to\r\nadd sufficient magnesia in order that the reaction should be manifestly\r\nalkaline. Afterwards the distillation is begun and the ammonia is\r\nreceived in an appropriate vessel containing one-tenth normal sulfuric\r\nacid and titrated in the usual way, or nesslerized.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the quantities of ammonia contained in the earth are\r\ngenerally very small it is necessary to be very particular in order to\r\navoid errors. The distilled water which is employed should be deprived\r\nof all traces of ammonia by prolonged ebullition, and the hydrochloric\r\nacid should be distilled in the presence of a little sulfuric acid. The\r\ntreatment with hydrochloric acid is for the purpose of destroying the\r\nabsorbing properties of the soil for ammonia, and to permit this last to\r\nenter into solution as chlorid. When there is need of very great\r\nprecision it is convenient to make a blank operation with the\r\nhydrochloric acid and water which are employed, in order to make a\r\ncorrection for the traces of ammonia which these reagents may contain.\r\n\r\n=408. Estimation of Ammoniacal and Amid Nitrogen by the Method of\r\nBerthelot and André.=[271]—Heat one hundred grams of earth for thirty\r\nhours on a steam-bath with about .500 cubic centimeters of dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid (fifteen grams of hydrochloric acid to 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water). At the end of this time throw the contents of the\r\nflask on a filter and wash with hot water until acid reaction has\r\nceased. Determine both the ammoniacal and amid nitrogen in the soluble,\r\nand the total nitrogen in the insoluble portion, the ammoniacal by\r\ndistillation with magnesia, and the amid and total with soda-lime.\r\n\r\n_Example._ A soil contained 0.1669 per cent total nitrogen. Of this\r\nthere were obtained:\r\n\r\n          As ammoniacal nitrogen                13.7 per cent\r\n          In the soluble part as amid nitrogen  56.2  „   „\r\n          In the insoluble part, total nitrogen 29.7  „   „\r\n                                                ————\r\n                           Sum                  99.6  „   „\r\n\r\n_Treatment of the Insoluble Portion._—Treat the part insoluble in\r\nhydrochloric acid with a three per cent solution of potash on a\r\nsteam-bath for thirty hours. Estimate the nitrogen remaining insoluble,\r\nfrom which the part dissolved can be determined by difference. The\r\npotash will dissolve usually about two-thirds of the remaining nitrogen.\r\n\r\nAbout ninety per cent of the total nitrogen present in an arable soil\r\nwill be rendered soluble by successive treatment with acid and alkali.\r\nThe reverse treatment will give practically the same result. It is\r\ntherefore immaterial, from an analytical standpoint, whether the acid or\r\nalkali be used first.\r\n\r\n=409. Estimation of Volatile Nitrogenous Compounds Emitted by Arable\r\nSoil.=—The following method, due to Berthelot and André,[272] may be\r\npracticed:\r\n\r\nPorcelain pots, containing one kilogram of soil, are placed under\r\nbell-jars of fifty liters capacity adjusted to glass dishes designed to\r\nreceive the waters of condensation.\r\n\r\nDuring the first period the pots are to be sprinkled from time to time,\r\nduring the duration of the experiment, through the upper tubulature, so\r\nas to prevent the soil from becoming dry. The water is partly condensed\r\non the sides of the bell-jar. It is removed each week through the\r\ninferior tubulature, treated with a little dilute sulfuric acid, and\r\npreserved for further study. A small vessel containing dilute sulfuric\r\nacid is placed near the porcelain pot for the purpose of collecting, as\r\nfar as possible, the evolved ammonia.\r\n\r\nDuring the second period the pots are not sprinkled, the soil becomes\r\ndry and there is no longer any condensation of water on the walls of the\r\nbell-jar. The two periods should include about five months, from May to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second period the following determinations are to be\r\nmade:\r\n\r\n1. The ammonia absorbed by the dilute sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n2. The ammonia set free by distillation with magnesia, such as may have\r\naccumulated in the condensed water.\r\n\r\n3. The organic nitrogen contained in the latter after elimination of the\r\nammonia. This is determined by adding a slight excess of acid,\r\nevaporation to dryness, and combustion with soda-lime, or by moist\r\ncombustion with sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n_Earth Employed._—One kilogram of sandy clay containing total nitrogen,\r\n0.09 gram. Nitrogen in sprinkling water, 0.000048 gram.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen in Exhaled Products._—\r\n\r\n                        FIRST PERIOD.

The\r\nnitrogen emitted under other forms than ammonia is, in every instance,\r\ngreatly superior in quantity, and this is the most important of the\r\nobserved phenomena. This is true at least with the kind of soil with\r\nwhich the experiment was made. With arable soil containing twenty times\r\nas much nitrogen as the soil described above this order is\r\nreversed,[273] the ammoniacal prevailing over the non-ammoniacal\r\nnitrogen volatilized.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena are doubtless greatly influenced in soil under culture\r\nby microbes, and the lowest orders of vegetation to which are doubtless\r\ndue the traces of non-ammoniacal volatile nitrogenous compounds, a sort\r\nof vegetable ptomaines.\r\n\r\n=410. General Conclusions.=—In the light of our present knowledge\r\nconcerning the methods of nitrogen determination in the soil in the form\r\nof organic compounds and ammonia, moist combustion with sulfuric acid is\r\nto be preferred to the older soda-lime process. For the nitrogen\r\ncombined as ammonia, the extraction of the sample with hydrochloric acid\r\nand subsequent distillation with an excess of freshly calcined magnesia,\r\nare recommended. For the study of the progressive decomposition of the\r\nnitrogenous compounds, the various processes devised by Berthelot and\r\nAndré are the best.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the nitric acid in the soil, the methods of studying the\r\nvarious nitrifying organisms, and of estimating the nitric acid\r\nproduced, will form the subject of the next part.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—At the Eleventh Annual Convention of the Association of Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists, held in Washington, August 23, 24 and 25, 1894,\r\nthe following process of soil extraction was adopted as the official\r\nmethod:\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Sample._—500 grams or more, of the air-dried soil,\r\nwhich may be either the original soil or that which has been passed\r\nthrough a sieve of coarser mesh, are sifted upon a sieve with circular\r\nopenings one-half millimeter in diameter, rubbing, if necessary, with a\r\nrubber pestle in a mortar, until the fine earth has been separated as\r\ncompletely as possible from the particles that are too coarse to pass\r\nthrough the sieve. The fine earths thoroughly mixed and preserved in a\r\ntightly stoppered bottle from which the portions for analysis are\r\nweighed out.\r\n\r\nThe coarse part is weighed and may be subjected to further examination,\r\n(as in _Bulletin 38, Div. of Chem._, pp. 65, 75 and 200.) It may\r\nsometimes be necessary to wash the soil through the one-half millimeter\r\nsieve with water, in which case proceed as directed on pp. 65 and 75 of\r\nthe above _Bulletin_. The use of water is to be avoided whenever\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Moisture._—Heat two to five grams of the air-dried\r\nsoil in a flat-bottomed, tared platinum dish; heat for five hours in a\r\nwater-oven kept briskly boiling; cover the dish, cool in a desiccator,\r\nand weigh.\r\n\r\nRepeat the heating, cooling, and weighing at intervals of two hours till\r\nconstant weight is found, and estimate the moisture by the loss of\r\nweight. Weigh rapidly to avoid absorption of moisture from the air. An\r\nair-bath must not be used in this determination.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Volatile Matter._—The platinum dish and soil used to\r\ndetermine moisture are used also to determine volatile matter. Heat the\r\ndish and dried soil to full redness until all organic matter is burned\r\naway. If the soil contain appreciable quantities of carbonates, the\r\ncontents of the dish, after cooling, are to be moistened with a few\r\ndrops of a saturated solution of ammonium carbonate, dried and heated to\r\ndull redness to expel ammonium salts, cooled in the desiccator and\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\nThe loss in weight represents the organic matter, water of combination,\r\nammonium salts, etc.\r\n\r\n_Extraction of Acid-Soluble Materials._—In the following scheme for soil\r\nanalysis it is intended to use the air-dried soil from the sample bottle\r\nfor each separate investigation. The determination of moisture, made\r\nonce for all on a separate portion of air-dried soil, will afford the\r\ndatum for calculating the results of analysis upon the soil dried at the\r\ntemperature of boiling water. It is not desirable to ignite the soil\r\nbefore analysis or to heat it so as to change its chemical properties.\r\n\r\nThe acid digestion is to be performed in a flask so arranged that the\r\nevaporation of acid shall be reduced to a minimum, but to take place\r\nunder atmospheric pressure and at the temperature of boiling water. Any\r\nflask resistant to acids is suitable, but it is not necessary to use a\r\ncondenser, as a simple bohemian glass tube eighteen inches in length\r\nwill answer the purpose of preventing loss of acid. Where it is not\r\ndesired to determine sulfur trioxid, an erlenmeyer fitted with a rubber\r\nstopper and hard glass tube will answer. The flask must be immersed in\r\nthe water-bath up to the neck or at least to the level of the acid and\r\nthe water must be kept boiling continuously during the digestion.\r\n\r\nIn the following scheme, ten grams of soil are taken, this being a\r\nconvenient quantity in most soils, in which the insoluble matter is\r\nabout eighty per cent. If desired, a larger quantity of such soil may be\r\ntaken, using a proportionately larger quantity of acid and making up the\r\nsoil solution to a proportionately larger volume. In very sandy soils,\r\nwhere the proportion of insoluble matter is ninety per cent or more,\r\ntwenty grams of soil are to be digested with 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nacid and the solution made up to 500 cubic centimeters or a larger\r\nquantity may be used, preserving the same proportions. It is very\r\nimportant that the analyst assure himself of the purity of all the\r\nreagents to be used in the analysis of soils before beginning the work.\r\n\r\n_Acid Digestion of the Soil._—Place ten grams of the air-dried soil in a\r\n150 to 200 cubic centimeter bohemian flask, add 100 cubic centimeters of\r\npure hydrochloric acid of specific gravity 1.115, insert the stopper\r\nwith condensing tube, place in a water or steam-bath and digest for ten\r\nhours continuously at the temperature of boiling water, shaking once\r\neach hour. Pour the clear liquid from the flask into a small beaker,\r\nwash the residue out of the flask with distilled water on a filter\r\nadding the washings to the contents of the beaker. The residue after\r\nwashing until free of acid, is to be dried and ignited as directed\r\nbelow. Add one or two cubic centimeters of nitric acid to the filtrate,\r\nand evaporate to dryness on the water-bath, finishing on a sand or\r\nair-bath to complete dryness; take up with hot water and a few cubic\r\ncentimeters of hydrochloric acid, and again evaporate to complete\r\ndryness. Take up as before, filter and wash thoroughly with cold water\r\nor with hot water slightly acidified at first with hydrochloric acid.\r\nCool and make up to 500 cubic centimeters. This is solution “A.” The\r\nresidue is to be added to the main residue and the whole ignited and\r\nweighed, giving the insoluble matter.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the various components of the solution remains\r\nessentially as described in the provisional methods of the Association\r\nwhich have already been given.\r\n\r\nIt is directed that all results of soil analysis be calculated on the\r\nbasis of the sample dried to constant weight at the temperature of\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AUTHORITIES CITED IN PART SIXTH.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  Annales de Chimie et de Physique, sixiéme serie, Tome 25, pp. 292, et\r\n  seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  L’Analyse du Sol, p. 14.\r\n\r\n3.

                           DRAINAGE WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=411. Introductory Considerations.=—The estimation of oxidized nitrogen\r\nin the soil would properly find a place in the preceding part; but on\r\naccount of the late progress in our knowledge of the source of this\r\nindispensable and costly plant food it has become necessary to give it\r\nespecial attention. The present part will, therefore, be devoted to a\r\nbrief statement of our present knowledge in respect of the origin of\r\noxidized nitrogen, a description of the nitrifying ferments and methods\r\nfor their isolation and determination and finally the most approved\r\nmethods of estimating the ammonia, nitrous, and nitric acids formed\r\nthereby both in the soil and the waters pertaining thereto or proceeding\r\ntherefrom. It is scarcely necessary to caution the reader not to\r\nconsider this part in any sense a treatise on the bacteria active in\r\nsoil chemistry. Its object is rather to place in the hands of the soil\r\nanalyst data which will enable him to intelligently study the soil\r\nphenomena depending on these organisms and to determine the extent and\r\ncharacter of their biological and chemical functions. These are matters\r\nwhich, up to the present time, have found no place in manuals dedicated\r\nto agricultural analysis.\r\n\r\n=412. Organic Nitrogen in the Soil.=—With the exception of the small\r\nquantities of nitric acid added to the soil directly by rain water, the\r\nwhole of the supply of this substance is derived from the products of\r\nthe oxidation of nitrogenous bodies. These products are either stored as\r\nthe results of past nitrification or are formed synchronously with their\r\nconsumption by the growing plant. Nitrogenous compounds are present as\r\norganic vegetable or animal remains and as humus. All vegetable and\r\nanimal material deposited in or on the soil contains more or less of\r\nthese proteid or nitrogenous matters while the amount of nitric acid\r\nsupplied in this way is probably represented entirely by the quantity in\r\nthe organism of the plant or animal and unabsorbed at the time of its\r\ndeath. In other words it is not demonstrated that nitrates or nitrites\r\nare in any sense a special product of plant growth save in the case of\r\nnitrifying organisms themselves which are supposed to be of a vegetable\r\nnature. Animal organisms do not in any sense assimilate nitric nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWith most plants, the quantity of proteid nitrogen which they can\r\ndeliver to the soil is in no case greater than the sum of organic and\r\nnitric nitrogen supplied in their food and they can therefore be\r\nregarded only as the carriers and conservers of this substance. On the\r\nother hand there are some plants notably those belonging to the\r\nleguminous family which permit of the development on their rootlets of\r\ncolonies of bacteria which have the faculty of rendering atmospheric\r\nnitrogen available for plant growth. Whether or not there exist plants\r\nother than the micro-organisms mentioned which are capable of directly\r\noxidizing and fixing atmospheric nitrogen is still an unanswered\r\nquestion. It is not probable, however, that the difficult task of\r\noxidizing atmospheric or free nitrogen would be accomplished in nature\r\nin only one way. In fact it has already been established that organisms\r\ndo exist which are capable of oxidizing free nitrogen in a manner wholly\r\nindependent of other plant life and to produce weighable quantities of\r\nnitric acid when developed in media of mineral matters and pure\r\ncarbohydrates to which free nitrogen has access. It is, therefore, fair\r\nto assume that the fixation of free nitrogen is a function of chemical\r\nactivity quite independent of ordinary plant life and that the\r\nleguminous plants take no further part in this process than that of\r\nproviding in their radical development a favorable nidus for the growth\r\nof the nitrifying organism.\r\n\r\nBy the action of denitrifying organisms a portion of the nitrogen of\r\nnitric acid is constantly restored to a free state, a far larger\r\nportion, perhaps, than is fixed in the atmosphere itself by the action\r\nof electricity. Were it not, therefore, for the activity of the\r\nnitrifying ferments the stores of nitrogen available for growing plants\r\nwould constantly become less. Instead of this being the case, however,\r\nit is probable that the contrary is true and that, by a wise system of\r\nagriculture, the total nitrogen at the disposal of plants may become\r\ngreater and greater in quantity.\r\n\r\n=413. Development of Nitric and Nitrous Acids in Soils.=—Owing to the\r\nsolubility of nitrates there can be but little accumulation of them in\r\nsoils in those countries where there is any considerable amount of\r\nrain-fall. On the other hand in arid regions there may be found\r\nextensive deposits of nitrates. The occurrence of a certain quantity of\r\nnitrates in the soil, however, is essential to the growth of plants.\r\nUntil within a few years little was known of the origin of nitric acid\r\nin the soil. The presence of nitrates in drainage waters was well\r\nestablished, likewise the consumption of nitric acid by the growing\r\nplant, but the method of its supply was unknown. In a general way it was\r\nsaid that the nitric acid came from electrical action and the oxidation\r\nof the albuminous bodies in the soil, but without specifying the manner\r\nin which this change takes place. The researches of Schloesing and\r\nMüntz, of Springer, Winogradsky, Frankland, Warington and others have\r\ndemonstrated the fact that this oxidation is caused by means of bacteria\r\nand that the nitrates formed can be consumed and destroyed by other\r\nspecies of this organism. In the one case the process has been called\r\nnitrification and in the other denitrification.[274]\r\n\r\nThe influence of these low organisms both in producing fertility in a\r\nsoil and maintaining it in a state of fertility is of the highest\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n=414. Conditions Necessary for Nitrification.=—In order to properly\r\nunderstand the reasons for many of the steps in investigating a soil for\r\nnitrifying organisms, it will be useful to state the general conditions\r\non which nitrification depends.\r\n\r\nThe nitrifying organism, like every other one, first of all feels the\r\nnecessity for food. In general, food which is given to microbes of all\r\nkinds consists of some organic matter together with the addition of\r\nmineral substances necessary to growth. These substances in general are\r\nphosphoric acid, potash, and lime. Of these articles of bacterial food\r\nphosphoric acid seems to be the most important. With the nitrifying\r\norganisms, however, it has been found that the organic matter can be\r\nomitted. In fact, as will be seen further on, the omission of organic\r\nmatter supplies the best condition for the proper isolation of the\r\norganisms. In other words some forms of the nitrifying organisms have\r\nthe property of subsisting wholly on mineral substances, _i. e._, are\r\ntrue vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe presence of oxygen is also necessary to the growth of the common\r\nnitro-organisms. In an atmosphere deprived of oxygen or in which the\r\noxygen is reduced to a very low percentage, the process of nitrification\r\nis retarded or stopped as the oxygen diminishes or disappears.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a base with which the nitrous or nitric acid formed may\r\nunite is also essential to the proper conduct of the process. For this\r\nreason the nitrification should take place in a solution which is feebly\r\nalkaline or in the presence of a base which can be easily decomposed so\r\nthat no acidity can take place. Calcium carbonate is a base well suited\r\nto favor the nitrifying process and its presence in a soil favors the\r\nrapid oxidation of proteid matter. The mistake must not be made,\r\nhowever, of supposing that an excess of alkali would favor\r\nnitrification. The contrary is true. A slight excess of alkali may\r\nprevent nitrification altogether when it is due to the common organisms\r\npresent in an arable soil. It may be that in soils charged with alkali a\r\ndifferent organism exists which is capable of exercising its functions\r\nwhen the alkali is in excess.\r\n\r\nThe temperature to which the nitrifying body is subjected is also a\r\nmatter of importance. The nitrifying organisms have the property of\r\nremaining active at lower temperatures than most bodies of their class.\r\nOn the contrary their action is retarded and destroyed by high\r\ntemperatures. The most favorable temperature for nitrification is about\r\nthat of blood heat; _viz._, 37°. At 50° the organism shows very little\r\nactivity and at 55° its activity ceases altogether. Nitrification,\r\nhowever, according to Warington, cannot be started in a solution if the\r\ninitial temperature is 40°.\r\n\r\nDesiccation has the same retarding influence on nitrification that a\r\nhigh temperature has. Even thoroughly air-drying a soil may destroy its\r\nnitrifying qualities.\r\n\r\nDarkness is also necessary to the proper progress of nitrification. In a\r\nstrong light, the activity of the organism is very much diminished or\r\ndestroyed altogether. A bright light like sunshine may even stop\r\nnitrification which has set in.\r\n\r\n=415. Effect of Potassium Salts on Rate of Nitrification.=—Dumont\r\nand Crochetelle have described some experiments to determine the\r\neffect of potassium salts alone and in combination with lime on\r\nnitrification.[275]\r\n\r\nSoil rich in vegetable mold (18.5 per cent of humus and 0.29 per cent of\r\nlime) was treated with varying amounts of potassium sulfate and\r\ncarbonate and kept for twenty days at 25°. In the untreated soil the\r\namount of nitric acid produced was twenty-five parts per million. When\r\npotassium carbonate was applied in quantities of from one-tenth to six\r\nper cent the amount of nitric acid increased from forty-seven parts per\r\nmillion to 438 parts when four and one-half per cent of the potassium\r\nsalt were used. Larger quantities caused a decrease in the amount of\r\nnitric acid produced. Very little effect, on the contrary, was produced\r\nby the action of potassium sulfate. When one-half per cent was employed\r\nthe quantity of nitric acid formed rose to fifty parts per million,\r\nwhile with quantities as high as five per cent it fell below the normal;\r\n_viz._, twenty-five parts per million.\r\n\r\nWhen calcium carbonate was added to the soil in conjunction with\r\npotassium sulfate there was a marked increase in the amount of nitrogen\r\noxidized. The activity of potassium sulfate in promoting nitrification\r\nis therefore increased by the presence of the calcium salt, potassium\r\ncarbonate and calcium sulfate being formed.\r\n\r\n=416. Production of Nitrous and Nitric Acids.=—In the following pages\r\nthe study of the methods of isolating the nitrous and nitric ferments\r\nwill be considered as one process, the final isolation of the two\r\nclasses of bodies being the result of their synchronous cultivation in\r\nappropriate media. The special process of the production of ammonia by\r\noxidation is not so well-known, and will therefore be described in\r\nbrief.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally conceded that the action of the nitrous organism is\r\nprecedent to that of the nitric, but the two processes go on so nearly\r\ntogether as to prevent the accumulation of any large quantities of the\r\nlower salt in the soil.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the formation of ammonia precedes that of nitrous acid is\r\nstill a subject for experimental demonstration. Chemically, both nitrous\r\nacid and ammonia may be produced by the reduction of nitric acid. In\r\nnature, the reverse of this process may be the customary method.\r\n\r\n=417. Production of Ammonia in the Soil by the Action of Microbes.=—It\r\nis highly probable that organic nitrogen in the soil in passing into the\r\nform of nitric acid exists at some period of the process in the form of\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\nMarchal has isolated and studied some of these ammonia-making\r\nbacteria.[276] Bacillus mycoides is the most active of these organisms.\r\nIt occurs constantly in surface soils and is present in the air and in\r\nnatural waters. In decomposing albumen it produces a strongly alkaline\r\nsolution due to ammonium carbonate. Organic carbon, during this process,\r\nis converted chiefly into carbon dioxid, but small quantities of formic,\r\npropionic, and butyric acids are also produced. Any organic sulfur which\r\nis present is converted into acid. No hydrogen or nitrogen is eliminated\r\nin a free state. While slight alkalinity is favorable to the development\r\nof this bacterium, yet it may be propagated in a feeble sulfuric acid\r\nsolution when the acid is less than one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe greatest activity of this organism is manifested at 30°. Below 5°\r\nand above 42° no ammonia is produced. The bacillus will not develop in\r\nan atmosphere of hydrogen or carbon dioxid, except in solutions of\r\norganic matter and nitrate. In addition to its action on egg albumen it\r\ndecomposes other proteid bodies as well as leucin, tyrosin, creatin, and\r\nasparagin. It, however, does not oxidize urea, nor does it develop in\r\nsolutions of ammonium salts and nitrates, except as mentioned above.\r\nWhen soluble carbohydrates are present, acids are formed. It is\r\nconcluded from these experiments that the final oxidation of organic\r\nnitrogenous matter is preceded by its conversion into ammonium\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\n=418. Summary of Statements.=—All nitrogenous matters which would be\r\nnaturally present in the soil may become subject to nitrification when\r\nthe proper conditions are supplied. Munro has also succeeded in\r\nnitrifying ethylamin, thiocyanates, and gelatin, urea, asparagin, and\r\nthe albuminoids of milk and rapeseed.\r\n\r\nThe products of nitrification are ammonia, nitrous or nitric acid,\r\ncarbon dioxid, and water. The ammonia and nitrous acid may not appear in\r\nsoils as the final products of nitrification, as the nitric organism\r\nattacks the latter at once and converts it into nitric acid. Nitrous\r\nacid and ammonia may also be produced in soils as one of the retrograde\r\nsteps in denitrification.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the conditions necessary for nitrification it may be said\r\nthat first, the proper material must be supplied; _viz._, an organic or\r\ninorganic nitrogenous compound capable of oxidation. In the second\r\nplace, the medium must be faintly alkaline, the temperature must not be\r\ntoo high, the nitrifying organisms must have abundant food, and the\r\nprocess must take place in the dark.\r\n\r\n=419. Order of Oxidation.=—It is quite definitely determined that\r\nactivity of the ammoniacal and nitrous organisms is the first step in\r\nthe process, since the nitric organism appears to have no power whatever\r\nto oxidize proteid compounds; while, on the other hand, the nitrous\r\norganism can not, in any case, complete the conversion of nitrous into\r\nnitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which permit certain organisms to oxidize free nitrogen\r\nhave not been definitely determined. The presence of such bodies in the\r\ntubercles attached to the rootlets of certain leguminous plants has been\r\nestablished. Lately, Winogradsky has isolated from the soil a nitrifying\r\norganism which is capable of converting free nitrogen into forms suited\r\nto nourish plant growth. This organism is cultivated in dextrose with\r\ncareful exclusion of all nitrogen, save that which exists in the air\r\ncarefully freed of every trace of ammonia or oxidized nitrogen.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the growth of this organism the sugar undergoes a\r\nbutyric fermentation, and nitrogen in an oxidized form is assimilated in\r\nan amount apparently equal to about one five-hundredth of the sugar\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\nThis result leads Warington[277] to remark that it is a fact of\r\nextraordinary interest, both to the physiologist and chemist, that a\r\nvegetable organism should be able to acquire from the air all the\r\nnitrogen it needs.\r\n\r\n=420. The Nitrification of Ammonia.=—The same organism which converts\r\norganic nitrogen into nitrous acid acts also on ammonia and its\r\ncompounds with a similar result. In fact, the formation of ammonia may\r\nbe regarded as one of the stages on the road from albuminoid to nitric\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nData have been collected by Schloesing on the nitrification of ammonia\r\ntaking place in arable soil, tending to show that this phenomenon is\r\naccomplished without appreciable loss of nitrogen in the gaseous\r\nstate.[278] This, however, does not hold good when the quantity of\r\nammonium carbonate introduced into the earth is largely increased. In\r\ntwo experiments, conducted by Schloesing, with a larger quantity of\r\nammonium carbonate, the loss of nitrogen was very notable. In certain\r\nconditions the production of nitrous acid may take place, and it is\r\ninteresting to know whether the appearance of nitrites has any influence\r\non the disengagement of free nitrogen. In order to determine this\r\nquestion a solution of calcium nitrite was prepared by decomposing\r\nsilver nitrite with calcium chlorid. From the results of the experiments\r\nmade it was seen that the nitrites were only the results of a retarded\r\nand partially incomplete nitrification. They are, moreover, thus an\r\nobstacle to the normal work of the nitrifying organisms. It is also\r\nestablished that when they are present a disengagement of gaseous\r\nnitrogen takes place, whether the nitrites are formed during the\r\nprogress of the experiment, or whether they were originally present.\r\nHowever, it is not best to say that the nitrites themselves have been\r\nthe cause of the disengagement of the nitrogen. It may happen that the\r\ndisengagement of the nitrogen and the presence of nitrites are simply\r\nsimultaneous and due to one and the same cause. The destruction of\r\nnitrates in the midst of reducing agents furnishes, according to the\r\nnature of these bodies and the circumstances, nitrous acid, nitrogen\r\ndioxid, nitrogen protoxid, free nitrogen, and even ammonia.\r\n\r\nThis destruction of nitrates and the appearance of oxids of nitrogen and\r\nof free nitrogen are more likely to be due to the presence of a separate\r\ndenitrifying ferment as pointed out by Springer than to have arisen in\r\nthe manner mentioned above by Schloesing. In the present state of our\r\nknowledge, moreover, we can hardly regard the presence of nitrites as an\r\nobstacle to complete nitrification. On the other hand, it seems to be\r\nwell established that the production of nitrites or ammonia is a\r\nnecessary step between organic nitrogen and nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=421. Occurrence of Nitrifying Organisms.=—According to the observations\r\nof Schloesing and Müntz the nitrifying organisms are widely\r\ndistributed.[279] Arable soil containing considerable humus seems to be\r\nthe medium in which they grow most freely and in which they accomplish\r\ntheir most important functions. Sewage waters are also rich in\r\nnitrifying ferments, and, in fact, all waters containing organic matter.\r\nThey are also found in running waters but not in great numbers. They\r\naffect chiefly the surface of bodies, and especially are found on the\r\nbottom of culture-flasks.\r\n\r\nThese authors have not found the nitrifying organisms in normal air.\r\nThey could not seed sterilized flasks by admitting air freely. The\r\nabsence of these ferments from the air is explained by reason of their\r\nsensitiveness to desiccation.\r\n\r\nThe method used by Schloesing and Müntz for the separation of the\r\norganism consisted in the preparation of original and subcultures in\r\nsterilized solutions containing nitrifiable matters. The proof of\r\nisolation was assumed when a given subculture contained only one kind of\r\norganism as seen with the microscope. The appearance of this organism,\r\nas described by the authors, was that of the later isolations by\r\nWarington and Winogradsky, but the method used could hardly now be\r\nregarded as decisive.\r\n\r\n=422. Determination of Nitrifying Power of Soils.=—In studying the\r\ndistribution of the nitrifying organisms in a soil the general method of\r\nprocedure is based on the production of nitrification in a convenient\r\nsolution by the organisms present in a given sample of soil. If the\r\nsolution seeded with the given portion of soil remain unaffected, it\r\nwill show that there were no nitrifying organisms present in the seed\r\nused. On the other hand, the vigor of the nitrifying process when once\r\nit is started, may be taken as an evidence of the number and activity of\r\nthe organisms in the soil, a sample of which was used for seed.\r\n\r\n=423. Composition of the Culture Medium.=—The solution recommended by\r\nWarington for the culture and isolation of the nitrifying ferments has\r\nthe following composition:\r\n\r\n   Ammonium chlorid                                   80 milligrams.\r\n   Sodium potassium tartrate                          80      „\r\n   Potassium phosphate                                40      „\r\n   Magnesium sulfate                                  20      „\r\n   calcium carbonate                           about 200      „\r\n   Pure bacteria-free water to make one liter.\r\n\r\n=424. Apparatus and Manipulation.=—The experiments are conducted in\r\nshort, wide-mouthed bottles. The initial volume of the solution in each\r\nbottle is 100 cubic centimeters, and the bottle should be of such size\r\nas to give a depth of liquid of from three to five centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe neck of the bottle is closed with a plug of cotton and this is\r\nprotected from dust by tying over it a cap of filter paper. Arranged in\r\nthis way, filtered air has free access to the solution. The bottle with\r\nthe solution thus protected is placed in a water-oven and kept near the\r\ntemperature of boiling water for six to eight hours to destroy any\r\norganisms present. When cool, the solution is ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe calcium carbonate used should be prepared by precipitation and added\r\nin a moist state. The calcium carbonate solution should be added after\r\nthe sterilization of the liquid, the precipitated carbonate being boiled\r\njust before it is added.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Seed._—The seed employed to start the nitrification\r\nshould be a small quantity of fresh soil, usually about one-tenth of a\r\ngram. If a previously nitrified solution be used for seed it should be\r\nthoroughly shaken and about one cubic centimeter of the solution removed\r\nfor seeding the new bottle.\r\n\r\nIn introducing the nitrifying liquor into the bottle the plug should be\r\nlifted slightly and a small pipette inserted by means of which the\r\nliquor is added. The operation should be carried on in a room perfectly\r\nfree from dust and to which no one but the operator has access. The\r\ngreatest care should be exercised to prevent any particles of matter\r\nentering the solution except that which is purposely added. In\r\nwithdrawing the liquor from the nitrifying solution cotton wool should\r\nbe pressed around the top of the pipette so that the entering air may be\r\nfiltered before admission to the interior of the bottle. The pipette\r\nwhich is used should be kept in boiling water until it is required for\r\nuse. After use it should be washed and replaced in boiling water until\r\nagain required.\r\n\r\nAfter seeding, the bottles should be placed in a dark cupboard and\r\nexposed to the ordinary temperature of the laboratory. If a higher or\r\nstated temperature be desired, the bottle should be placed in a metal\r\nbox the temperature of which can be regulated to any degree.\r\n\r\n_Test of the Commencement of Nitrification._—The beginning of the\r\nnitrification can be determined in a solution by testing it with\r\ndiphenylamin. One cubic centimeter of the solution withdrawn as above\r\nindicated, is placed in a small beaker, a drop of solution of\r\ndiphenylamin sulfate in sulfuric acid added, and then two cubic\r\ncentimeters of concentrated sulfuric acid and the contents of the beaker\r\nwell shaken. The development of a violet-blue color shows the presence\r\nof nitric or nitrous acid. This test will detect one part of nitric\r\nnitrogen in twenty million of water.\r\n\r\n_Determining the Progress of Nitrification._—The progress of\r\nnitrification is determined by repeated examinations for ammonia by\r\nnesslerizing, and for nitrous acid with metaphenylenediamin. Each\r\nexperiment is made with five cubic centimeters of the solution withdrawn\r\nas above indicated and placed in test-tubes, always of the same size.\r\nThe reaction with the nessler solution is then made by adding it in the\r\nusual way. The colorations are recorded as, trace, small, moderate,\r\nconsiderable, large, and abundant.\r\n\r\nIf the change produced by the organism consisted in the formation of\r\nnitrites only, the ammonia in the original solution would fall from\r\n_large_ to _trace_, while the nitrous acid would increase from _trace_\r\nto _large_. If the nitrification consisted in the production of nitrates\r\nonly, the ammonia would diminish without any corresponding production of\r\nnitrous acid. In mother solutions which contain ammonium carbonate\r\ninstead of sulfate, it should not be forgotten that the ammonia might\r\ngradually disappear owing to the volatilization of the carbonate without\r\nany corresponding production of free nitrites or nitrates. The complete\r\ndisappearance of the ammonia in the above experiments shows the\r\ncompletion of the process.\r\n\r\n=425. To Determine the Distribution of the Nitrifying Organism in the\r\nSoil.=—The principle on which the determination of the distribution of\r\nthe nitrifying organism in the soil depends, rests upon seeding the\r\ngrowth solutions with samples of soil taken at different depths and\r\ncarefully protected from the time of sampling until the time of seeding\r\nfrom any admixture of accidental organisms.\r\n\r\nThe method of Warington is the simplest and best to follow.[280] The\r\nsamples of soil are taken by digging a pit of convenient depth usually\r\nfrom eight to ten feet. A fresh surface is then cut on one of the sides\r\nof the pit at the spot selected for sampling. This surface is scraped\r\nwith a freshly ignited platinum spatula. The spatula should then be\r\nwashed, re-ignited, and cooled, and a small portion of the soil, at the\r\ndepth required, detached with the spatula and transferred at once into\r\none of the growth bottles already described.\r\n\r\nThe growth solution best suited for the purpose contains four cubic\r\ncentimeters of urine per liter. Each bottle should also contain some\r\nfreshly precipitated calcium carbonate. In sterilizing urine solutions\r\nthe calcium carbonate should be added before the heating instead of\r\nafterwards. The quantity of soil taken for each seeding should be about\r\none-tenth of a gram.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the cotton stopper has to be lifted to introduce the soil,\r\nopportunity is given for the entrance of any organisms floating in the\r\nair. Experience, however, has shown that air free from soil dust very\r\nseldom contains nitrifying organisms. The seeded bottles are placed in a\r\ndark cupboard of moderate temperature as already described.\r\n\r\n=426. Sterilized Urine Solution.=—The sterilized urine solution used for\r\nthe determination of the distribution of the nitrifying organisms in the\r\nsoil, is made by taking four cubic centimeters of healthy urine,\r\ndiluting to one liter, adding some freshly precipitated calcium\r\ncarbonate, stoppering with cotton wool and heating for several hours at\r\nthe boiling temperature of water.\r\n\r\nAs a result of Warington’s experiments it was shown that the nitrifying\r\norganism in the soil did not exist, at least in portions of one-tenth of\r\na gram, to a greater depth than eighteen inches. In only one case was\r\nnitrification produced from a sample of soil taken at a greater depth\r\nand this may have been due to the accidental introduction of organisms\r\nfrom other sources. It may be assumed that any long delay in the\r\ncommencement of nitrification under favorable conditions, implies the\r\npresence of a very limited quantity of organisms in the solution. Thus a\r\ncomparative study of the period of incubation and the progress of\r\nnitrification in solutions seeded with soils taken at different depths\r\nor at different places, becomes a fair index of the number and vitality\r\nof the nitrifying organisms contained therein.\r\n\r\n=427. Depth to Which Micro-Organisms are Found.=—Koch states that at the\r\ndepth of about one meter, the soil is nearly free from every kind of\r\nbacteria.[281] These observations have been corroborated by Pumpelly and\r\nSmyth who find that no infection of a bacterial nature is produced in a\r\nsterilized solution from samples of clay taken at the depth of nine feet\r\nbelow the surface.[282]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the nature of the experiments above described that\r\nthe nitrifying processes go on almost exclusively in those portions of\r\nthe soil which are subject to cultivation, while in the subsoil and\r\nbelow the processes of nitrification are either retarded or arrested.\r\nAny stores of nitrogenous matter, therefore, in an insoluble state,\r\nresting in the subsoil, are preserved from oxidation and consequent\r\nwaste until such time as they may be removed to near the surface.\r\n\r\n=428. Isolation of the Nitrous and Nitric Organisms in the Soil.=—The\r\naction of the organisms which produce nitrification either in form of\r\nnitrites or nitrates, having been thoroughly established, and the method\r\nof testing the soil therefor given, it remains to describe a method by\r\nmeans of which these organisms in the soil may be isolated and obtained\r\nin a state of purity. The difficulties attending this process are\r\nextremely great on account of the similarity of the two organisms. All\r\nearlier attempts to make pure cultures of the two separate organisms\r\nwere attended with but little success.\r\n\r\nAccording to Winogradsky the method of culture on gelatin so long\r\npracticed is not to be relied upon.[283] It is very difficult to\r\neliminate by this process the organisms which grow rapidly in gelatin\r\nand which mature their colonies in two or three days, but where they\r\nrequire eight or ten days to produce a colony the method is successful.\r\nIn fact, by the gelatin process as it was at first practiced, a good\r\ndeal was owing to chance, but sometimes by a happy accident a pure\r\nnitro-bacterium might be isolated.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was considered that a liquid could be regarded as sterile if\r\nit gave no growth upon gelatin. It has, however, now been demonstrated\r\nthat a liquid may contain large numbers of nitro-bacteria and still\r\nproduce no growth upon gelatin. However, for the organisms which\r\naccompany the nitro-bacteria in soils, it is regarded as certain that if\r\nno growth on gelatin is produced by them they are absent. Therefore in\r\nthe case of a solution which has been seeded with a soil, if it can be\r\nbrought to such a state as to produce no growth on gelatin, it may be\r\nsafely assumed that it contains no bacterial organisms save those which\r\nare capable of producing nitrites or nitrates. Therefore if such a\r\nsolution produce nitrification and at the same time no growth upon\r\ngelatin, it may be considered as a proof of the isolation of the\r\nnitro-organisms from all others.\r\n\r\nThis method was also worked out independently by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland.[284]\r\n\r\nWinogradsky says further he confesses that he has advanced these views\r\nonly provisionally and without being convinced of their infallibility.\r\nStrictly speaking, the proof of seeding gelatin is not sufficient alone\r\nbecause the absence of growth can not be regarded as the exclusive\r\nprivilege of the nitro-bacteria. Such might be the case sometimes for an\r\naccidental mixture of microbes, introduced with any given sample of soil\r\ninto the cultures, but the criterion is not absolute. Microbes, for\r\nexample, of a sulfurous or ferruginous nature may be cited, for which\r\nthe gelatin layer is not only unfavorable but even fatal. It may thus\r\nhappen that there may be eliminated from the solution all that will grow\r\nupon gelatin without freeing it from some special kinds of cultures,\r\nrefractory like the nitro-bacteria, but which might reappear if they\r\nshould be resown in some favorable nutritive solution. On account of\r\nthis fault in the process, Winogradsky has been impressed with the\r\nnecessity of bringing out a better method.\r\n\r\nIn using the gelatin media it is necessary to find the one that is\r\nsuited to nourish these organisms, which would evidently be the way\r\npromising the greatest success. This having been found, and those\r\norganisms which produce colonies being easily recognizable, a great step\r\ntowards the solution of the problem will have been made and the more so\r\nas the medium would be at the same time absolutely unfavorable to other\r\nforms of microbes. On account of the slow degree of development of the\r\nnitro-organisms, all others would probably have opportunity to grow and\r\nstrengthen to their exclusion, unless these interfering organisms could\r\nbe completely removed.\r\n\r\n=429. The Culture Solution.=—The culture-solution, first proposed by\r\nWinogradsky, had the following composition:\r\n\r\nTo ten grams of gelatin or one part of agar-agar in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water add potassium phosphate, one-tenth of a gram;\r\nmagnesium sulfate, five-hundredths of a gram; calcium chlorid, trace;\r\nand sodium carbonate, half a gram. The solution being sterilized in the\r\nusual way by heating, there are added to it a few cubic centimeters of a\r\nsterilized solution containing two-tenths per cent of ammonium sulfate.\r\nSuch a solution has been proved to be very favorable to nitro-organisms.\r\nNevertheless the experiments with such solutions gave no definite\r\nresults and they were abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe non-success of this method led Winogradsky to adopt a nitrifying\r\nsolution which absolutely excluded all organic substances. Instead of\r\nusing an animal or vegetable gelatinous substance he used one of a\r\nmineral nature, first proposed by Graham and Kühne.[285] Two of these\r\ngelatinous mineral substances were considered; _viz._, the aluminum\r\nhydroxid and the hydrate of silica. The latter was chosen.\r\n\r\n=430. Preparation of the Mineral Gelatinous Solution.=—The soluble glass\r\nwhich is found in commerce is generally of a thick, sirupy consistence.\r\nIt is first diluted with three times its volume of water. One hundred\r\ncubic centimeters of this liquid are poured with constant stirring into\r\nfifty cubic centimeters of dilute hydrochloric acid and the mixture\r\nplaced in a dialyzer. It is useless to employ a standard solution of\r\nsilica. All that is necessary is to submit to dialysis a liquid with an\r\nexcess of acid and sufficiently dilute not to be exposed to the danger\r\nof being spontaneously gelatinized in the dialyzer. The dialyzer is left\r\nfor one day in running water and two days in distilled water, often\r\nrenewed. The solution is then ready for use. This is the case when it is\r\nno longer rendered turbid on the addition of silver nitrate, showing\r\nthat the hydrochloric acid has been entirely extracted. The solution is\r\nthen to be sterilized by boiling, and preserved in a glass flask closed\r\nwith a plug of cotton.\r\n\r\nMore recent instructions by Winogradsky for preparing the gelatinous\r\nsilica recommend dialyzing the soluble glass after treatment with\r\nhydrochloric acid in a parchment tube.[286] The proportions of silicate\r\nand acid are 100 cubic centimeters of the silicate solution (1.06\r\nspecific gravity) and 100 cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid (1.1\r\nspecific gravity). With a dialyzing tube placed two days in running\r\nwater and one day in distilled water frequently changed it will be found\r\nthat the acid is completely removed. One hundred cubic centimeters of\r\nthe residual liquor giving no reaction for hydrochloric acid are\r\nconcentrated to twenty cubic centimeters. When cold there is added one\r\ncubic centimeter each of a solution of ammonium sulfate and of sodium\r\ncarbonate, together with corresponding quantities of the other nutrient\r\nsalts commonly employed. The ammonium sulfate should never exceed two to\r\ntwo and a half, and the sodium carbonate four parts per thousand. To the\r\nflask containing the above substances is added one drop of the\r\nseed-liquor, which may be a soil water or a drop from some previous\r\nculture. The flask is shaken and the mixture poured into a low circular\r\nglass dish which is covered by one slightly larger in diameter (Petri\r\ndouble dish). To the liquid in the dish is added a drop of a cold\r\nsaturated solution of common salt, and it is then stirred with a\r\nplatinum spatula. The addition of the salt greatly favors the setting of\r\nthe jelly. The jelly may set in from two to three hours, but a longer\r\ntime secures better results in the end.\r\n\r\nIn employing these preparations as seed, after the organisms have grown,\r\nit is absolutely necessary to use the isolated cellules and not the\r\naggregated masses (zoöglœæ). The latter are rarely free of foreign germs\r\nwhich adhere to their gelatinous envelope. Since the zoöglœæ can not be\r\nbroken up by any artificial means it is necessary to await their\r\nspontaneous disintegration in order to separate the mobile monads. The\r\nopalescence of the culture-liquid is a sure index of this separation.\r\n\r\nThe particles of mineral gelatin to be used as seed for nitrifying are\r\nbest taken as follows:\r\n\r\nA glass tube is drawn out immediately preceding the operation, until the\r\nend is as fine as a hair. The surface of the mineral gelatin is\r\nmagnified by means of a dissecting microscope magnifying 80 to 100, to\r\nthe proper degree and the preparation table is so arranged as to give a\r\nperfect support to the right hand which should hold the filament of\r\nglass. The smallest colony is then pricked with the needle and the end\r\nof the glass is broken and dropped into the flask which is to be seeded.\r\nThe seed is thus selected in as small a particle as may be desired, only\r\na few cells, but it can always be ascertained with certainty that some\r\nof the particles have been obtained by this operation.\r\n\r\nThe method of cultivation on mineral jelly is considered by Winogradsky\r\nan important resource in the study of the nitrifying organisms. It\r\nremoves the chief difficulties heretofore existing in discovering and\r\ncharacterizing these organisms among the innumerable micro-organisms of\r\nthe soil. The long series of cultures necessary to separate the\r\norganisms are rendered nugatory. By directly introducing a little of the\r\nearth into the silicic jelly the active organisms in nitrification can\r\nbe at once discovered. It is preferable, however, as indicated below, to\r\npreviously produce a nitrification in an aqueous solution by a trace of\r\nearth and to take from it the seed for impregnating the solid medium. In\r\norder to show at once a proof of its nitrifying character, it is only\r\nnecessary to take a small bit of the mineral jelly, the size of a grain\r\nof rye, and to throw it into a little sulfuric acid which has been\r\ntreated with diphenylamin. There is at once formed a blue spot equal in\r\nintensity to a saturated solution of anilin blue.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the growths which nitro-organisms make in a medium of the\r\nkind described, they are far from being so marked as are those produced\r\nby ordinary micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nA nitro-bacterium is not capable of the energy of growth which is\r\nrecognized for the greater number of microbes. The colonies contained in\r\nthe gelatin always remain small. The largest among them are just visible\r\nto the naked eye like white points. Along the striae, on the contrary,\r\nthere is formed quite a thick white crust. To the naked eye, in general,\r\nthere is nothing very characteristic in the formation of colonies in a\r\nmedium of this nature. But this impression changes altogether when the\r\nplacques are examined with a low magnifying power. The colonies,\r\nespecially those of the interior surface, reveal then an aspect so\r\ncurious as to be well remembered when once seen.\r\n\r\nThis mineral gelatin, as has already been noticed, is very unfavorable\r\nto the growth of microbes other than nitro-bacteria and becomes altered\r\nonly under the action of the air. If the placques be carefully preserved\r\nfrom desiccation the culture of these organisms can be continued for\r\nseveral weeks. Although they do not seem to increase, the colonies, as\r\nwell as the jelly, are still in a good condition at the end of that\r\ntime. Nevertheless the expectation that this medium would prevent the\r\nformation of any foreign organism has not been realized. Some of the\r\norganisms which accompany the nitro-bacteria in soil, also grow upon the\r\nsilicic jelly; but they do not form colonies, properly so-called, and\r\ntheir growth is extremely slow. They generally make their appearance\r\nbefore the nitro-bacteria and spread exclusively upon the surface in\r\nform of white spots, so transparent that without careful examination\r\nthey would not be discovered. Having reached a certain size the spots do\r\nnot change during entire weeks. This circumstance renders the operations\r\nof isolation somewhat delicate, but does not prevent them.\r\n\r\n=431. Preparation and Treatment of the Solution to be Nitrified.=—The\r\norganisms having been grown on the siliceous gelatin in the manner\r\ndescribed they are tested for their nitrifying power as follows:\r\n\r\nThe mineral solution which is to be nitrified with the above preparation\r\nis composed of ammonium sulfate, four-tenths gram; magnesium sulfate,\r\nhalf a gram; potassium phosphate, one-tenth gram; calcium chlorid,\r\ntrace; sodium carbonate, six-tenths to nine-tenths gram; and distilled\r\nwater, 100 cubic centimeters. The sulfates with the calcium chlorid on\r\nthe one hand, and the phosphate and carbonate on the other, are\r\ndissolved separately and the two solutions sterilized separately and\r\nmixed after cooling. The seeding is then done as described above.\r\n\r\n=432. Isolation of the Nitrous and Nitric Organisms.=—Instead of\r\nproceeding immediately to the isolation of special organisms in the\r\nsoil, the preliminary period of purification is prolonged by Winogradsky\r\nby allowing the free growth to take place of all the organisms which can\r\nbe maintained in the ordinary medium.[287]\r\n\r\nThe composition of the culture solution employed is as follows:\r\nDistilled water, 1,000 parts; potassium phosphate, one part; magnesium\r\nsulfate, half a part; calcium chlorid, trace. Each flask receives\r\nbesides this some magnesium carbonate, freshly washed with boiling water\r\nand added in slight excess.\r\n\r\nThe flasks thus charged are sterilized, and after sterilization there\r\nare added two cubic centimeters of a solution of two per cent of\r\nammonium sulfate, which, when added to fifteen or twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of liquid give from two to two and a half parts per\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThey are then seeded with soil. The reasons for this preliminary\r\ntreatment are as follows: First, all the observations upon the\r\nenfeeblement of the oxidizing power of these organisms have been made\r\nupon cultures seeded simply by the fresh soil, and in cultures derived\r\ntherefrom. In the second place, the existence of the two forms, one\r\nnitrous and the other nitric, prevents at once the isolation of a single\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nSamples of soil from Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and America, were\r\nused for seed for the experiments. First, the cultures were made by\r\nseeding with a small quantity of each of these samples of soil, and each\r\none of these cultures served as a point of departure for a series of\r\nsubcultures. The temperature of the cultures should be kept constantly\r\nat 30°.\r\n\r\nThe method of following the nitrification adopted by Winogradsky is\r\nessentially that of Warington, the percentage of ammonia remaining at\r\nany time being determined by nesslerizing. To detect the presence of\r\nnitric acid the nitrous acid is decomposed by boiling with ammonium\r\nchlorid in excess, or with urea, and then diphenylamin is used as a\r\nreagent. By treatment with ammonium chlorid and boiling, the ammonium\r\nnitrite is resolved into free nitrogen and water as indicated by the\r\nequation NH₄NO₂ = N₂ + 2H₂O. Or the total oxidized nitrogen may be\r\nestimated by the Schloesing method or by any of the standard methods\r\nhereafter given. The nitrous acid is then determined by potassium\r\npermanganate and the nitric acid by difference.\r\n\r\nA great difference is to be noted between freshly taken earth and that\r\nwhich has been kept for a long while, especially when sealed. With fresh\r\nearth taken near the surface a mere trace is sufficient to produce\r\nnitrification. With samples of earth which have been kept for a long\r\nwhile and thoroughly dried, several grams must be added in order to\r\nsecure perfect nitrification. The period of incubation with the samples\r\nof earth ranges from three to twenty days. The beginning of the\r\nphenomenon is revealed by the appearance of nitrous acid, of which the\r\nquantity is increased very rapidly, but in the end it disappears and is\r\ntransformed into nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=433. Statement of the Results.=—The method of stating the results of\r\nexamination of soils for nitrifying organisms is illustrated by the\r\nfollowing example:\r\n\r\nSoil from Zurich. The culture was seeded on the 11th of October, one\r\ngram of soil being taken. On the 20th of October the nitrous acid had\r\nreached its maximum of intensity and there was no ammonia left. On the\r\n29th of October the nitrous acid remained almost stationary and there\r\nwas hardly any nitric acid present. On the 1st of November the reaction\r\nfor nitrous acid began to decrease. On the 5th of November the reaction\r\nfor nitric acid was very intense. On the 11th of November the nitrous\r\nacid had all disappeared except a mere trace.\r\n\r\nThe above order of phenomena was observed with all the samples of soil\r\ntried, from which it is concluded with certainty that nitrifying\r\norganisms transplanted directly from their natural medium in the soil\r\ninto a liquid easily nitrifiable produce at once nitrous acid in\r\nabundance. The phenomenon of nitrification is divided into two periods\r\ntherefore, of which the first is devoted to the production of nitrites,\r\nand the second consists in the oxidation of the nitrites, and this does\r\nnot commence until the total disappearance of the ammonia. Occasionally\r\nthe formation and oxidation of the nitrites practically go on together,\r\nbut never equally, the oxidation of the nitrites being always sensibly\r\nbehind their formation.\r\n\r\n=434. Method for Subcultures.=—From the mother cultures described above,\r\nWinogradsky makes subcultures as follows:\r\n\r\nThe solution to be nitrified is prepared as in the mother cultures. The\r\nseeding is accomplished by adding a small quantity of the liquor of the\r\nmother culture after shaking. Subcultures can be made in this way to the\r\nseventh generation.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the oxidation of the nitrites the results may be entered\r\nas negative if they have not disappeared at the end of two months.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the process of oxidizing the nitrites is in\r\nprogress or not the total nitrous acid is estimated, and the process\r\nrepeated at the end of eight or ten days. Should there be no diminution\r\nof the nitrous acid within this time it may be considered that the\r\nfurther oxidizing action is not taking place.\r\n\r\n=435. Use of a Solid Medium.=—It may be justly claimed that the action\r\nof nitrifying organisms in a liquid is not to be compared with their\r\naction in a solid medium, such as a soil which is their natural habitat.\r\nIt might be, therefore, that the inability of the nitrous organism to\r\nproduce nitrates is due to the nature of the medium in which it is\r\ncultivated. Winogradsky in order to determine this question cultivated\r\nthe organism in a solid medium of two kinds, first a silicate gelatin\r\nimpregnated with an ammonium salt and second in sterilized earth. The\r\nsilicate jelly is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nMix a jelly of silica containing some ammonium sulfate with sterilized\r\nsoil. The seeding is done with one of the subcultures which no longer\r\nhas the power of producing nitrates.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the jelly the seeding is accomplished as follows:\r\n\r\nA minute drop of a culture liquid is taken with a capillary glass tube\r\nand applied in striae to different parts of the solid jelly; or a minute\r\ndrop of the culture liquid may be mixed with the jelly before\r\nsolidification. The Petri dishes in which these cultures are made can be\r\npreserved in a moist atmosphere and thus the desiccation be easily\r\nprevented for a long time. From time to time small pieces of the jelly\r\nas large as a pea can be taken and tested for the progress of\r\nnitrification.\r\n\r\n_Results._—The nitrous reaction, both in the prepared jelly and in\r\nsterilized soil, will appear in a few days. At the end of from seven to\r\ntwelve days it will have attained its maximum intensity and will then\r\nremain stationary indefinitely. Sterilized soil has no power to generate\r\nthe nitric from the nitrous ferment. The two organisms are, therefore,\r\nof different species.\r\n\r\nAfter a few generations the power of producing nitrates seems to be lost\r\nalthough the nitrous ferment may still be active. This suppression of\r\nthe power to oxidize the nitrites is not due to any pernicious influence\r\nof the culture-medium but to the condition of the successive solutions\r\nat the time of taking the seeding samples.\r\n\r\n=436. Microscopic Examination.=—A small particle of the deposit in\r\nthe culture-liquid is spread on a glass slide and dried. There is\r\nthen added a drop of very dilute perfectly transparent malachite\r\ngreen solution. Malachite green is Bittermandelölgrün, or\r\ntetramethyldiamidotriphenylcarbinol. Use the zinc chlorid double\r\nsalt or oxalate. In about half a minute it is washed and colored by\r\na very dilute solution of gentian violet which is left to act for\r\nsome time. The cells then appear distinctly colored on a colorless\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nIn examining in this way nitrous cultures under a moderate enlargement\r\nthere are seen particles of material covered with scattered groups and\r\nmassive zoöglœæ composed of cells which are, doubtless, identical.\r\n\r\nBy their round or roundish forms, by their relative size and especially\r\nby their numbers and uniformity they are at once distinguished from the\r\nother vegetations which are generally of a purely bacillus shape.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of some shreds of mycelium coming from some oidium in\r\nthe soil the microscope reveals nothing but the organisms described. The\r\nmicroscopic appearance[288] of the nitrous ferment is shown in Fig. 69.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Figure 69. (Upper figure.) Nitrous ferment prepared by Winogradsky\r\n    from soil from Cito.\r\n\r\n  Figure 70. (Lower figure.) Nitric ferment prepared by Winogradsky from\r\n    soil from Cito.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe general conclusions of Winogradsky are:\r\n\r\n1. Each soil possesses but one organism capable of oxidizing ammonia.\r\n\r\n2. Soils from one locality have always the same kind of nitrifying\r\nferment.\r\n\r\n3. Soils from different and distant countries contain nitrifying\r\norganisms which differ from one another in some respects so much so that\r\nit may be necessary to distinguish a few species or even genera in these\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n=437. Isolation of the Nitric Ferment in Soils.=—The principle of the\r\nseparation of this ferment as described by Winogradsky rests upon the\r\nfact that in culture solutions of a mineral nature free from ammonia the\r\nnitrous ferment will not grow, whereas if nitrite or nitrous acid be\r\npresent the nitric ferment will grow.[289] In a few generations,\r\ntherefore, the nitrous ferment will be entirely eliminated.\r\n\r\nSolution employed:\r\n\r\n                   Distilled water      1,000 grams.\r\n                   Potassium phosphate      1 gram.\r\n                   Magnesium sulfate      0.5   „\r\n                   Calcium chlorid     trace.\r\n                   Potassium nitrite     0.22 gram.\r\n\r\nTo culture-flasks containing 100 cubic centimeters of the above mixture\r\nafter sterilization about one-tenth gram of fresh soil is added. In\r\nfavorable conditions the nitrous acid will disappear in about fifteen\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nSubcultures are made by seeding fresh portions of the sterilized\r\nsolution with one or two cubic centimeters of the mother culture. The\r\noperation is continued until the nitrous ferment is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe organisms in the deposit in the culture-flasks are then subjected to\r\nmicroscopic examination in the manner already described for the nitrous\r\nferment; or proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n=438. Culture on Solid Media.=—Take a liquid which has been employed in\r\nthe culture of a nitrous ferment and evaporate to one third of its bulk.\r\nGelatinize the residue by adding double its volume of the silicic acid\r\nsolution prepared as already directed.\r\n\r\nThe jelly is placed in the glass vessels usually employed. The seeding\r\nmay be done with a few drops of a culture-liquid containing the nitric\r\nferment as obtained above. The first reaction will appear in from eight\r\nto ten days. In about forty-five days the nitrous acid in the jelly will\r\nhave entirely disappeared. Two classes of colonies are noticed under the\r\nmicroscope. The first to appear are small colonies which never extend\r\nbeneath the surface of the jelly. In cultures seeded with these colonies\r\nthere is no oxidation of nitrous acid. The second class of colonies\r\nextends into the interior of the jelly. They are much larger than the\r\nfirst, of a yellowish-gray color and not spherical but rather lenticular\r\nin shape. Cultures seeded with these colonies will lose their nitrous\r\nacid in about ten days or two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe growth of these organisms in a liquid scarcely merit the name of\r\ncultures. The naked eye can usually distinguish no form of vegetation.\r\nThe liquid remains clear, the surface is free from any film, no flocks\r\nare deposited. Colored and examined in the microscope the organisms\r\nfound are so puny as to make doubtful their oxidizing power. There is an\r\napparent contradiction between the powerful chemical action that these\r\norganisms can produce and their apparent deficiency in physical\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nThese organisms are best found by cultivating them in a very limpid\r\nsolution. The bottoms of the culture boxes will be found covered with an\r\nextremely tenuous gelatinous deposit communicating to the glass a feeble\r\ngrayish-blue tint. The culture bottle is inclined and the bottom\r\nscratched with a recently drawn-out capillary tube. The colonies rise in\r\nthe tube together with a little of the liquid. The colonies are dried,\r\nmounted, and colored as already described and when examined with the\r\nmicroscope are found to be composed exclusively of masses of an organism\r\nof extreme minuteness.\r\n\r\nThe organism remains attached so firmly to the bottom of the culture\r\nbottle that it can be washed several times with pure water without\r\ndanger of detachment and thus rendered more pure.\r\n\r\nIn old cultures which are sustained by new additions of nitrite an\r\nextremely transparent pellicle on the bottom of the flask can be\r\ndistinguished. By shaking the liquid some fragments may be detached and\r\nmade to float through the fluid. With a little care and patience these\r\nflocks can be captured, mounted, and colored. Since they show the nitric\r\norganism in its natural state their preparations are of the greatest\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe best preparations are made by coloring with malachite green and\r\ngentian violet and then coloring again hot with magenta. Afterwards the\r\npreparation is washed with warm water at 50°–60° which takes almost the\r\nwhole of the color from the gelatinous matter. The cells are then\r\nclearly presented colored a reddish violet on a rose background. These\r\norganisms[290] are shown in figure 70.\r\n\r\nThe figure shows the cells united by a gelatinous membrane and grouped\r\nin small dense masses composed often of a single layer of organisms. The\r\ncells are generally elongated, rarely regularly spherical or oval. Their\r\nmean length does not exceed half a micromillimeter and their thickness\r\nis from two to three times less.\r\n\r\nThe difference in form of the nitrous and nitric ferments is very marked\r\nand leaves no doubt of the existence of these two forms which are as\r\ndistinct as could be desired in microbic discrimination.\r\n\r\n=439. Dilution Method of Warington.=—The method pursued by Warington in\r\npreparing pure cultures of the nitrifying ferment is based on the\r\nwell-known principle of dilution which may be expressed as follows:[291]\r\nIn a liquid containing bacterial ferments dilution may be practiced\r\nuntil a drop of the liquid may be taken which will contain no more than\r\na single organism of any one kind. If now proper solutions be seeded\r\nwith single drops of this solution, some of them may give colonies of\r\npure cultures of any given organism. The solution to be nitrified\r\nemployed by Warington had the following composition:\r\n\r\n                   Water               1000    parts.\r\n                   Ammonium carbonate     0.25   „\r\n                   Ammonium chlorid       0.50   „\r\n                   Potassium phosphate    0.04   „\r\n                   Magnesium sulphate     0.02   „\r\n                   Calcium sulphate       0.02   „\r\n\r\nThe ammonium chlorid is added to prevent the precipitation of magnesium\r\nand calcium phosphates. The solution is kept in wide-mouthed, stoppered\r\nbottles to prevent the loss of ammonium carbonate, the bottles being\r\nonly half full. About 100 cubic centimeters are taken for each\r\nexperiment. These bottles are sterilized and seeded with fresh soil in\r\nthe ordinary way. They are then covered with paper caps and placed in a\r\ndark cupboard at a constant temperature of 22°.\r\n\r\n_Special Media._—A quantity of arable soil is exhausted of nitrates by\r\nwashing with cold water under pressure. The soil is then boiled with\r\nwater and filtered. The clear amber-colored solution obtained may be\r\nused instead of water in the above formula.\r\n\r\n_Solid Media._—(1) Ordinary ten per cent gelatin made with beef broth\r\nand peptone. (P)\r\n\r\n(2) A ten per cent urine solution solidified with six per cent of\r\ngelatin. (U)\r\n\r\n(3) A solution of one gram of asparagin, one-half gram sodium acetate,\r\none-half gram potassium phosphate, two-tenths gram magnesium sulfate,\r\ntwo-tenths gram calcium sulfate, and one liter of water solidified with\r\nsix per cent gelatin. (As)\r\n\r\nOther solid media may also be employed for the purpose of favoring, as\r\nmuch as possible, the growth of the nitrifying organisms.\r\n\r\nThe first culture in the ammonium carbonate solution given above, is\r\nalways made by seeding with a little unmanured arable soil. Subcultures\r\nare seeded from this mother culture by seeding new solutions with a few\r\ndrops of the original. In all cases tried by Warington the subcultures\r\nproduced only nitrous fermentation while the original cultures produced\r\nthe nitric fermentation.\r\n\r\n=440. Microscopic Examination.=—The microscopic examination of the\r\norganisms formed is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nThe cover glasses for microscopic objects are placed at the bottom of\r\nthe culture-flask, the cover glasses being previously sterilized. At the\r\nend of the nitrification the liquid is removed with a pipette and the\r\nflask containing the cover glasses dried at 35°. The cover glasses are\r\nthen removed and stained. The microscopic appearance of the organisms\r\nobtained by the previous cultures showed masses of corpuscles usually of\r\noval shape and having a length generally exceeding one micromillimeter.\r\nAn immersion objective giving a magnification of 800 diameters is\r\nsuitable for this work.\r\n\r\nOther forms of organisms are also met, the whole series being\r\ncharacterized as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The corpuscles already mentioned. Larger ones are frequently rough\r\nin outline resembling masses of siliceous sea-sand. The smaller oval\r\ncorpuscles are regular in form.\r\n\r\n(2) Some very small circular organisms often appearing as mere points\r\nand staining much more plainly than the preceding.\r\n\r\n(3) A few slender bacilli, staining faintly.\r\n\r\nAll the cultures obtained by the above method give abundant growth on\r\ngelatin.\r\n\r\n=441. Trials with the Dilution Method.=—One part of the third subculture\r\nin the ammonium carbonate solution described above, is mixed with 500\r\nparts of thoroughly boiled water and one drop from a sterilized\r\ncapillary tube is added to each of five bottles containing the\r\nsterilized ammonium carbonate solution. In Warington’s experiments one\r\nof the five bottles was found to have nitrified after forty-one days.\r\nAfter ninety-one days two more were nitrified. Two bottles did not\r\nnitrify at all. All three solutions which nitrified gave growths on\r\ngelatin. The growths took place more speedily on gelatin U and As than\r\non P.\r\n\r\nThe organisms obtained on gelatin were seeded in appropriate liquid\r\nmedia but no nitrification was obtained.\r\n\r\nA subculture from solution No. 2 of the first dilution mentioned above,\r\nwas diluted to one one-thousandth, one ten-thousandth, one\r\none-hundred-thousandth, and one one-millionth. Each of these dilutions\r\nwas used for seeding with five sterilized solutions of ammonium\r\ncarbonate, using the method of seeding above described. At the end of\r\n190 days not one of these solutions had nitrified.\r\n\r\nWarington supposed that the cause of failure in the method just\r\nmentioned might be due to the alkalinity of the ammonium carbonate.\r\nWhile this solution could be seeded in the ordinary way with fresh earth\r\nit might be that the faint alkalinity which it presented might prevent\r\nit altogether from action when the nitrifying agent was reduced to a few\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nHe therefore changed the solution to one of the following composition:\r\n\r\n                  Water               1,000    parts.\r\n                  Ammonium chlorid        0.02 part.\r\n                  Potassium phosphate     0.06   „\r\n                  Magnesium sulfate       0.03   „\r\n                  Calcium sulfate         0.03   „\r\n\r\nThe solution was divided in twenty stoppered bottles which were half\r\nfilled. The bottles were divided into four series, A, B, C, D, each one\r\nconsisting of five bottles, and these were respectively seeded with one\r\ndrop from dilutions to one one-thousandth, one ten-thousandth, one\r\none-hundred-thousandth, and one one-millionth of a second subculture of\r\nNo. 3 in the first dilution series.\r\n\r\nAfter 115 days, nitrification had occurred in ten of the bottles. The\r\nother ten did not nitrify at all. Each of the nitrifying solutions was\r\nspread on gelatin, P and U being employed. Growth took place far more\r\neasily on gelatin U than on gelatin P. Of the ten nitrified solutions\r\nthere were three which gave no growth on gelatin U, either when spread\r\non the surface or introduced into the substance of the jelly. There were\r\ntherefore secured nitrifying solutions which did not contain organisms\r\ncapable of growing on gelatin. The supposition is therefore fair that\r\nthey were pure nitrifying organisms. These fresh, pure organisms had the\r\nfaculty of converting ammonia into nitrous acid only and not into nitric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nWith the organisms thus prepared a number of solutions of potassium\r\nnitrite containing phosphates and other mineral ingredients were seeded.\r\nIn no case was any loss of nitrite found, which is proof that the\r\nsolution contained no organisms capable of oxidizing nitrous acid. The\r\norganisms prepared as above, have the power of nitrifying organic\r\nsubstances containing nitrogenous bodies.\r\n\r\nThe organism isolated as described and examined under the microscope is\r\nseen to contain two forms. The first one is nearly spherical in shape,\r\nthe corpuscles varying in size from mere points to a diameter of one\r\nmicromillimeter. The form is very striking and easily stained. The\r\nsecond form is oval-shaped and attains a length distinctly exceeding one\r\nmicromillimeter. Sometimes it is a regular oval and sometimes it is\r\negg-shaped. This form is stained less easily than the preceding or\r\nspherical form.\r\n\r\n=442. Method of Staining.=—The method of staining employed is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nA drop of the culture-liquid is placed on a glass slide and mixed with\r\nthe filtered stain by means of a wire. A cover glass is placed on the\r\ndrop and allowed to stand for half an hour. It is then pressed down on\r\nthe slide and the liquid which exudes wiped off and hollis glue run\r\naround the cover glass. In this way the organism is stained in its own\r\nculture-fluid and can be seen in its true form without any possibility\r\nof the destruction of its shape by drying. The plate is bright and clear\r\nthough colored.\r\n\r\nIf the preparation is to be mounted in balsam a drop of the culture is\r\ndried in the center of a cover glass. It is then placed for some minutes\r\nin dilute acetic acid to remove matter which would cause turbidity. The\r\ncover glass with its contents is then washed, dried, and stained for\r\nsome hours in methyl violet.\r\n\r\n=443. Classification of Nitrifying Organisms.=—The names proposed by\r\nWinogradsky for the various organisms are the following:\r\n\r\nFor the general group of microbes transforming ammonia into nitric acid,\r\n_Nitro-bacteria_.\r\n\r\nFor the nitrous ferments of the Old World\r\n\r\nGenus, _Nitrosomonas_:\r\n\r\n      Species, _Nitrosomonas europaea_.\r\n\r\n                        _Nitrosomonas javanensis._\r\n\r\nFor the nitrous microbes of the New World:\r\n\r\nGenus, _Nitrosococcus_.\r\n\r\n    Species, not determined.\r\n\r\nFor the nitric ferment:\r\n\r\nGenus, _Nitrobacter_.\r\n\r\n=444. Nitrification in Sterilized Soil.=—The process of nitrification in\r\nsterilized soil, when seeded with pure cultures, is determined as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Sample._—The fresh sample of arable soil is freed from\r\npebbles and vegetable débris and reduced to as fine a state of\r\nsubdivision as is possible in the fresh state. It is placed in\r\nquantities of about 800 grams in large crystallizing dishes.\r\n\r\nOne dish is set aside for use in the natural state, and the other,\r\nhermetically closed, is placed in a sterilizing apparatus and subjected\r\nto the action of steam for two and a half hours. This treatment is\r\nrepeated three times on as many successive days.\r\n\r\n_Seeding of Sample._—Each of the two dishes is moistened with fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of pure water containing 500 milligrams of ammonium\r\nsulfate. The sterilized portion is then seeded with a preparation of the\r\npure nitrous ferment, produced as before described. The seed is prepared\r\nby filtering a few cubic centimeters of the nitrous culture liquid\r\nthrough asbestos. The asbestos is well washed and then thrown into a\r\nflask containing a few cubic centimeters of sterilized water and well\r\nshaken. The water carrying the filaments of asbestos is poured drop by\r\ndrop on the surface of the soil in as many places as possible. The two\r\ndishes of soil are kept at an even temperature of 20° in a dark place.\r\nWinogradsky found that, treated in this way, the unsterilized soil\r\nproduced only nitrates, while the sterilized portions produced only\r\nnitrites.[292]\r\n\r\n=445. Variation of the Determinations.=—To vary the conditions of the\r\nexperiment Winogradsky uses twelve flasks of the erlenmeyer shape, four\r\nhaving bottoms twelve centimeters in diameter, and eight of them five\r\ncentimeters in diameter. In each of the four large flasks are placed 100\r\ngrams of fresh soil, and in each of the eight small flasks twenty-five\r\ngrams. The eight small flasks are designated a, b, c, d, and a′, b′, c′,\r\nd′, and the four large flasks A, B, C, D.\r\n\r\nThe flasks a, b, c, d, and a′, b′, c′, d′, are placed in a stove at 30°\r\nfor several days before use, while A, B, C, and D, are kept at 22°–23°\r\nfor the same length of time. The soil in the small flasks is, therefore,\r\nsomewhat drier than that in the large ones.\r\n\r\nThe flasks are treated as follows:\r\n\r\na, a′, A, contain the soil as prepared above for control.\r\n\r\nb, b′, B, are sterilized at 135° and seeded with a drop of the pure\r\nnitrous culture.\r\n\r\nc, c′, C, sterilized as above and seeded with a little of the\r\nunsterilized earth.\r\n\r\nd, d′, D, sterilized as above and seeded with pure nitrous and pure\r\nnitric cultures.\r\n\r\nAfter sterilization there was added to the small flasks two cubic\r\ncentimeters of a twenty per cent sterilized ammonium sulfate solution,\r\nand to the large ones six cubic centimeters. At the end of a month or\r\nsix weeks the contents of the flasks are thrown on a filter and washed\r\nwith cold water until a drop of the filtrate gives no blue color with\r\ndiphenylamin. The respective quantities of nitrite and nitrate are then\r\ndetermined in the filtrates by the usual processes, which will be fully\r\ndescribed further along.\r\n\r\n=446. Sterilization.=—One of the chief requisites for success in the\r\nbacteriological investigation of soils is found in the thoroughness of\r\nthe sterilizing processes. The value of cultures depends chiefly on the\r\ncare with which the introduction of foreign germs is prevented. In the\r\nfollowing description a mere outline of the method of sterilization is\r\npresented, while those who wish to study more carefully the details of\r\nthe process are referred to the standard works on bacteriology.\r\n\r\n=447. Sterilization of the Hands.=—It is important that the hands of the\r\noperator handling apparatus and materials for bacteriological work\r\nshould be sterilized. The sterilization may be accomplished in the\r\nfollowing way:\r\n\r\nThe nails should be cut short and thoroughly cleaned with soap and\r\nbrush. The hands are thoroughly washed in hot water with soap. After\r\nwashing in hot water the hands should be washed in alcohol and ether.\r\nThey are then dipped in the sterilizing solution.\r\n\r\nThis liquid may consist of a three per cent solution of carbolic acid,\r\nwhich is the one most commonly employed. A solution of corrosive\r\nsublimate, however, is perhaps the best disinfectant. It should contain\r\nfrom one to two parts of the crystallized salt to 1,000 parts of water.\r\nIt has lately been advised to use the sublimate in an acid solution.\r\nAcetic acid or citric acid may be employed, but hydrochloric acid is\r\nrecommended as the best, in a preparation of one-half part per 1,000.\r\nFor stronger solutions of sublimate containing more than a half per\r\ncent, equal quantities of common salt should be added. The solution\r\nshould be made with sterilized water.\r\n\r\nAfter dipping the hands in the sterilizing solution they should be dried\r\nwith a napkin taken directly from a sterilizing oven, where it has been\r\nkept for some time at the temperature of boiling water. Where only\r\nordinary work in bacteriology is contemplated this sterilization of the\r\nhands is not necessary. It is practiced chiefly in antiseptic surgery.\r\n\r\n=448. Sterilizing Apparatus.=—With platinum instruments the most\r\neffective and easiest way for sterilizing is to hold them in the flame\r\nof a bunsen until they are red hot. Steel and copper instruments can not\r\nbe treated in this way without injury. They are best sterilized by\r\nsubmitting them to dry heat in a drying oven at a temperature of\r\n150°–160° for two hours. Glass and porcelain apparatus can be sterilized\r\nbest in the same way.\r\n\r\nAll apparatus and materials employed should be used in a space as free\r\nas possible from dust, so that any germs which might be carried in the\r\ndust can be excluded from the apparatus in transferring it from one\r\nplace to another.\r\n\r\n=449. Methods of Applying Heat.=—Sterilization by means of heat may take\r\nplace in several ways.\r\n\r\n_First. Submitting the Materials to Dry Heat Without Pressure._—The\r\ntemperature in sterilization of this kind may vary from the temperature\r\nof boiling water at sea-level to 160° obtained by an oil-bath or by an\r\nair-oven.\r\n\r\n_Second. Sterilization in a Liquid Under Pressure._—This form of\r\nsterilization may be effected by sealing the liquid in a strong vessel\r\nand submitting it to the required temperature. If the temperature\r\nrequired be greater than that of boiling water the vessel can be\r\nimmersed in a solution of some mineral salt which will raise the\r\nboiling-point.\r\n\r\n_Third. Sterilization in Steam Under Pressure._—This method of\r\nsterilization consists in placing the body in a proper receptacle in\r\nvessels to which the steam can have access and then admitting steam from\r\na boiler at any required pressure. In the case of small apparatus, such\r\nas the autoclave, the steam can be generated in the apparatus itself.\r\nThe variety of apparatus used in the above method of sterilization is\r\nvery great, but all the forms of apparatus employed depend upon the\r\nprinciples indicated.\r\n\r\n=450. The Sterilizing Oven.=—The apparatus for sterilization by means of\r\nhot, dry air usually consists of a double-walled vessel made of\r\nsheet-iron, usually with a copper bottom. The apparatus is shown in Fig.\r\n71.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is controlled by means of a thermometer, T, and the\r\ngas-regulator, _R_. This is one of the ordinary gas-regulators by means\r\nof which the amount of gas supplied to the lamp is increased if the\r\ntemperature should fall, and diminished if it should rise above the\r\nrequired degree. The best form of the sterilizing ovens is provided with\r\na means for circulating the hot air so that the temperature may be made\r\nuniform throughout the mass. This can be accomplished by introducing a\r\nmechanical stirrer, or by the movement of the air itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 71. STERILIZING OVEN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBetween the walls of the vessel may be placed water, provided the\r\ntemperature of sterilization be that of boiling water. If it should\r\nrequire a higher temperature than boiling water, a solution of salt can\r\nbe added until the required temperature is reached, or the space between\r\nthe two walls may be left vacant and hot air made to circulate around\r\nthe oven.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the oven, except at the bottom where the lamp strikes\r\nthe copper surface, should be protected by thick layers of asbestos or\r\nother non-conducting material. To avoid danger of flying filaments, this\r\ncovering should be coated with some smooth paint which will leave an\r\neven surface not easily abraded.\r\n\r\n=451. Sterilization with Steam at High Pressure.=—The apparatus used for\r\nthis is commonly called an autoclave and is shown in Fig. 72.\r\n\r\nThe top is movable and held in place by the clamp, _a_, which is fixed\r\nby the screw worked by the lever, _b_. The vessel itself is\r\ndouble-jacketed and the pressure is obtained from water in the vessel\r\nheated by means of the lamp, _c_. The actual steam pressure is indicated\r\nby the index _d_. The safety-valve, _e_, allows any excess of steam to\r\nescape above the amount required for the maintenance of the pressure.\r\nThis, however, is best regulated by the lamp. The outer jacket permits\r\nthe heat from the lamp to circulate around the inner pressure vessel,\r\nand the holes near the top, _oo_, are for the escape of the heated\r\ngases. Enough water is placed in the bottom of the inner pressure vessel\r\nto supply all the aqueous vapor necessary to produce the required\r\npressure and still leave some water in excess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 72. AUTOCLAVE STERILIZER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe materials to be sterilized are held on the shelves of the stand and\r\nthe vessels may be of various kinds according to the nature of the\r\nmaterial to be sterilized. The vessels containing the material being\r\ncovered, the steam does not come in actual contact with it. At the end\r\nof the operation the safety-valve must not be opened to allow the escape\r\nof the steam, otherwise the remaining water would be rapidly converted\r\ninto vapor and would be projected over the materials on the shelves. The\r\nlamp should be extinguished and the apparatus allowed to cool. The\r\nautoclave is not only useful for sterilizing purposes but can be made of\r\ngeneral use in the laboratory where heat under pressure, as in the\r\nestimation of starch, etc., is required.\r\n\r\nThese two forms of apparatus are sufficient to illustrate the general\r\nprinciples of sterilization by hot air and steam. There are, however,\r\nmany variations of these forms designed for special use in certain kinds\r\nof work. For full descriptions of these, reference is made to catalogues\r\nof bacteriological apparatus.\r\n\r\n=452. Arnold’s Sterilizing Apparatus.=—A very simple and cheap steam\r\nsterilizer has been devised by Arnold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 73. ARNOLD’S STERILIZER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWater is poured into the pan or reservoir, B, Fig. 73, whence it passes\r\nthrough three small apertures into the shallow copper vessel, A. It is\r\nthere converted into steam by being heated with any convenient lamp, and\r\nrises through the funnel in the center to the sterilizing chamber. Here\r\nit accumulates under moderate pressure at a temperature of 100°. The\r\nexcess of steam escapes about the cover, becomes imprisoned under the\r\nhood, E, and serves to form a steam-jacket between the wall of the\r\nsterilizing chamber and the hood. As the steam is forced down from above\r\nand meets the air it condenses and drips back into the reservoir. Such\r\nan apparatus as this is better suited to commercial purposes, as the\r\nsterilizing of milk, than for scientific uses.\r\n\r\n=453. Thermostats for Culture Apparatus.=—It is important in the culture\r\nof micro-organisms that the temperature should be kept constant during\r\nthe entire time of growth. Inasmuch as some operations continue for as\r\nmuch as three months it is necessary to have special forms of apparatus\r\nby means of which a given temperature, during the time specified, can be\r\nmaintained. This is secured by means of an oven with an automatic\r\ntemperature regulator, practically built on the principle of the hot air\r\nsterilizing oven already described.\r\n\r\nThe essential principles of construction are, however, that the\r\nregulator for the temperature should be delicate and that the\r\nnon-conducting medium surrounding the apparatus should be as perfect as\r\npossible, so that the variations in temperature from changes in the\r\nexterior temperature, are reduced to a minimum. This delicacy is secured\r\nby introducing a drop of chloroform-ether into a confined space over the\r\nmercury of the regulating apparatus. The doors of the chamber are\r\ndouble, the interior one being of glass so that the exterior door can be\r\nopened for inspection of the progress of the bacterial growth without\r\nmaterially interfering with the interior temperature. A convenient form\r\nis shown in Fig. 74.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 74. LAUTENSCHLÄGER’S THERMOSTAT.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus figured, is oval in shape, although circular or other\r\nforms are equally as effective. The arrangement of the lamp, _a_,\r\nthermometers, _t t t_, and gas-regulator, _g_, and the double doors,\r\n_d d_, is shown in the engraving and does not require further\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe usual temperatures for cultures range from 22° to 35°, and the\r\napparatus once set at any temperature will remain fixed with extremely\r\nminute variations for an indefinite time. The apparatus possesses a heat\r\nzone which, by the arrangement of the regulator, is kept absolutely\r\nconstant. The space between the walls of the apparatus being filled with\r\nwater, the temperature is maintained even in every part. The apparatus,\r\nas constructed, is independent not only of the surrounding temperature\r\nwithin ordinary variations, but also of the pressure of the barometer.\r\nThree thermometers are employed to determine the temperature of the\r\nheating zone, the water space and the inner space. The arrangement of\r\nthe gas-regulator is of an especial kind, as mentioned above, by means\r\nof which the consumption of gas is reduced to a minimum. This apparatus\r\ncan be regulated to suit the character of the work.\r\n\r\n=454. Microscopic Apparatus Required.=—Any good microscope, capable of\r\naccurate observation, of high power, may be used for the bacteriological\r\nobservations necessary to soil analysis.\r\n\r\nPreference should be given to the patterns adapted to receive any\r\nadditional accessories which may be subsequently required for advanced\r\nwork. The stage, in addition to being fitted with a sliding bar, should\r\nhave a large circular or horseshoe opening to facilitate focusing\r\noperations. A mechanical stage is a desirable acquisition if really well\r\nmade, but a plain stage is preferable for many purposes. A rackwork,\r\ncentering sub-stage is essential for advanced work, and in the absence\r\nof the more complete form, there should at least be a fitting beneath\r\nthe stage to take the diaphragm and condenser. An iris diaphragm will be\r\nfound more useful than any other kind in practice, since the size of the\r\nopening can be increased very gradually at will.\r\n\r\nOne of the best lamps is known as the paraffin lamp and is fitted with a\r\nhalf-inch wick. This will give even more light than is actually\r\nrequired, and a steady flame, perfectly under control, may be obtained.\r\nFor the minute details to be observed in high-grade microscopic work,\r\nsuch as is required in the bacteriological examination of soils,\r\nreference must be had to the standard works on bacteriology and\r\nmicroscopy.\r\n\r\n=455. General Conclusions.=—The nitrogenous food of plants is provided\r\nin several ways; _viz._, (1) By the nitrogen brought to soil in rain and\r\nsnow. This nitrogen is chiefly in the form of ammonia and nitric acid.\r\nThe nitrogen gas in solution in rain water has no significance as a\r\nplant food. (2) By the action of certain anaerobic organisms herding in\r\nthe rootlets of leguminous plants, free nitrogen may be oxidized and put\r\ninto form for assimilation. (3) By the action of certain organisms on\r\nnitrogenous compounds pre-existing in the soil, ammonia, nitrous acid,\r\nand finally, nitric acid, are produced. It is believed that the plant\r\norganism, unaided by the activity of a micro-organism, is unable to\r\nassimilate nitrogen unless it be fully oxidized to nitric acid. (4)\r\nThere exist micro-organisms capable of acting directly on free nitrogen\r\nindependent of other plant growth, but the significance of this possible\r\nsource of plant food is, at the present time, unknown. (5) The\r\nmicro-organisms of importance to agriculture may be isolated and\r\ndeveloped to the exclusion of other organisms of a similar character.\r\nThis isolation is best accomplished in culture-media consisting\r\nessentially of a mineral gelatin to which is added only pure\r\ncarbohydrates and the necessary mineral nourishment. (6) The nitrifying\r\nferments consist probably of several species, of different geographic\r\ndistribution. Different types of soils probably have nitrifying\r\norganisms of different properties. This is illustrated by the fact that\r\nnitrification is accomplished in dry alkaline soils under conditions in\r\nwhich the ordinary nitrifying organisms would fail to develop. (7) The\r\nstudy of typical soils in respect of the kind, activity, and vigor of\r\ntheir nitrifying organisms has become as important a factor in soil\r\nanalysis as the usual determination of physical and chemical\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n          DETERMINATION OF NITRIC AND NITROUS ACIDS IN SOILS.\r\n\r\n=456. Classification of Methods.=—The minute quantities in which highly\r\noxidized nitrogen exists in soils render the operations of its\r\nquantitative estimation extremely delicate. On the other hand, the easy\r\nsolubility of these forms of combination and the absence of absorptive\r\npowers therefor, in the soil, render the separation of them from the\r\nsoil a matter of great ease. It is possible, therefore, to secure all\r\nthe nitrates and nitrites present in a large quantity of earth in a\r\nsolution which can be concentrated under proper precautions to a volume\r\nconvenient for manipulation. The method of this extraction is the same\r\nfor all the processes of determination. The methods of analysis suited\r\nto soil extracts, as a rule, may also be used in the determination of\r\nthe same compounds in rain, drainage, and sewage waters, and for the\r\nqualitative and quantitative control of the progress of nitrification.\r\nThe various processes employed may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The conversion of the nitrogen into the gaseous state and the\r\ndetermination of its volume directly. This is accomplished by combustion\r\nwith copper oxid and metallic copper.\r\n\r\n2. The conversion of the nitrogen into nitric oxid and the volumetric\r\ndetermination thereof. The decomposition of a nitrate with ferrous\r\nchlorid in the presence of free hydrochloric acid is an instance of this\r\ntype of methods.\r\n\r\n3. The oxidation of colored organic solutions and the consequent\r\ndisappearance of the characteristic color, or its change into a\r\ndifferent tint. The indigo and indigotin processes are examples of this\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n4. The production of color, in a colorless or practically colorless\r\nsolution, by the treatment thereof with the nitrate in presence of an\r\nacid which decomposes it with the liberation of oxidizing compounds. The\r\ndepth of color produced is compared with that formed by a known quantity\r\nof a pure nitrate solution until the two colorations are alike. The\r\nmethods depending on the use of carbazol or acid phenol sulfate\r\nillustrate this class of reactions.\r\n\r\n5. The conversion of the nitrogen into ammonia by moist combustion with\r\nsulfuric acid in the presence of certain organic compounds, _e. g._,\r\nsalicylic acid, and the collection of the ammonia in standard acid, the\r\nexcess of which, is determined by titration.\r\n\r\n6. The reduction of nitrates to ammonia by nascent hydrogen and the\r\nrecovery of the ammonia produced by distillation and collection in\r\nstandard acid.\r\n\r\n7. The reduction of nitrates by electrolytic action and the collection\r\nof the ammonia as above.\r\n\r\n8. The decomposition of nitrates with the quantitative evolution of a\r\ndifferent element, and the direct or indirect measurement of the evolved\r\nsubstance. The quantitative evolution of chlorin on treating a nitrate\r\nwith hydrochloric acid, the collection of the chlorin in potassium\r\niodid, and the determination of the iodin set free, form a process\r\nbelonging here.\r\n\r\n=457. Relative Merit of Methods.=—The processes mentioned in the\r\nclassifications embraced under numbers (1) and (5) of the preceding\r\nschedule are sufficiently described in the paragraphs devoted thereto,\r\nunder soil and fertilizers. In practice at the present time it is rare\r\nto determine the nitrogen in nitrates by the copper oxid method. The\r\nmore rapid and equally exact processes of colorimetric comparison or\r\nreduction by nascent hydrogen are in all respects to be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe indigo methods among the colorimetric processes are not so much in\r\nuse now as those which depend on the development of a color. Lawes and\r\nGilbert considered them far inferior to the Schloesing method. The\r\ndeveloped color methods are especially delicate and are to be preferred\r\nin all cases where the detection of the merest traces of nitrates is\r\ndesired. Where nitrates are present in considerable quantities the\r\nreduction method with nascent hydrogen is to be preferred over all\r\nothers. In all these cases the judgment of the analyst must be\r\nexercised. The particular method to be employed in any given case can\r\nnot be determined save by the intelligent discrimination of the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\n=458. The Extraction of Nitric Acid from the Soil.=—The easy solubility\r\nof nitric acid and of nitrates in water is taken advantage of in the\r\nseparation of these bodies from the soil. A convenient quantity, usually\r\nabout 1,000 grams of the fine soil, is taken for the extraction. Instead\r\nof freeing the soil entirely from water, it is better to determine the\r\namount of water in the air-dried or prepared sample, and base the\r\ncalculation on 1,000 grams of the water-free soil.\r\n\r\nAll samples of soil, when taken for the purpose of examining for\r\nnitrates, should be rapidly dried to prevent the process of\r\nnitrification from continuing after the sample is taken. For this\r\npurpose the soil should be placed in a thin layer in a warm place,\r\n50°–60°, until air-dried. It still contains in this case a little\r\nmoisture but not enough to permit nitrification to go on.\r\n\r\nOne thousand grams of soil prepared as above are treated with 2,000\r\ncubic centimeters of distilled water, free of nitric acid, and allowed\r\nto stand for forty-eight hours with frequent shaking. One thousand cubic\r\ncentimeters of the extract are then filtered, corresponding to 500 grams\r\nof the dry soil. A small quantity of pure sodium carbonate should be\r\nadded to the filtrate which is then evaporated on a water-bath to a\r\nvolume of about 100 cubic centimeters. Should a precipitate be formed\r\nduring evaporation it should be separated by filtration, the filter\r\nwashed thoroughly, and the filtrate again evaporated to a volume of 100\r\ncubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nIn taking a soil for the determination of nitrates, it is well to extend\r\nthe sampling to a considerable depth. If the sample be taken only to the\r\ndepth of nine inches, it should be in dry weather when the nitrates are\r\nnear the surface.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which a soil is dried has also an influence on the\r\nquality of nitric nitrogen remaining after desiccation.\r\n\r\nIf a wet soil be dried at 100°, the nitrates present will suffer partial\r\ndecomposition. This is probably due to deoxidation by organic matter\r\npresent. On the other hand, ordinary air-drying affords opportunity for\r\ncontinued nitrification, thus increasing the residuum of oxidized\r\nnitrogen. The above method is essentially that followed by Warington at\r\nRothamstead.\r\n\r\nThe method of drying practiced at Rothamstead, in order to secure\r\nresults as nearly accurate as possible is the following:[293]\r\n\r\nThe soil is broken up directly after it is taken from the field, and\r\nspread on trays in layers one inch deep. The trays are then placed in a\r\nroom at 55°. The drying is completed in twenty-four hours. After drying,\r\nstones and roots are removed, and the soil is finely powdered and placed\r\nin bottles.\r\n\r\nFor extracting the nitrates, a funnel is prepared by cutting off the\r\nbottom from a bottle four and a half inches in diameter. A nicely\r\nfitting disk of copper gauze is placed in the bottom of this funnel, and\r\nthis is covered with two filter papers, the upper one having a slightly\r\ngreater diameter than the lower. The paper is first moistened, and then\r\nfrom 200 to 500 grams of the dry powdered soil introduced. The funnel is\r\nconnected with the receiving flask of a filter pump, and pure water\r\npoured on the soil until it is thoroughly saturated. The water is then\r\nadded in small quantities. When the filtrate amounts to 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters the process may be discontinued, since all the nitrates in\r\nthe soil will be found in this part of the filtrate.\r\n\r\nThe extract obtained above is evaporated to convenient bulk for the\r\ndetermination of nitric nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE NITRIC OXID PROCESS.\r\n\r\n=459. Method of Schloesing.=—The processes for estimating nitrogen by\r\ncombustion with copper oxid and by moist combustion with sulfuric acid\r\nhave both been used for the determination of the quantity of nitrogen\r\nexisting in a highly oxidized state. These processes will be fully\r\ndiscussed under the head of fertilizers. In the case of soil extracts,\r\ndrainage waters, etc., it will be sufficient to discuss, for the\r\npresent, only those processes adapted especially to a quick and accurate\r\nestimation of oxidized nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the method of Schloesing depends on the decomposition\r\nof nitrates in the presence of a ferrous salt and a strong mineral\r\nacid.[294] The nitrogen in the process appears as nitric oxid, the\r\nvolume of which may be directly measured, or it may be converted into\r\nnitric acid and titrated by an alkali.\r\n\r\nThe typical reactions which take place are represented in the following\r\nequation:\r\n\r\n6FeCl₂ + 2KNO₃ + 8HCl = 3Fe₂Cl₆ + 2KCl + 4H₂O + 2NO.\r\n\r\n=460. Schloesing’s Modified Method.=—The Schloesing method as now\r\npracticed by the French chemists is conducted in the apparatus shown in\r\nFig. 75.[295] The carbon dioxid is generated by the action of the\r\nhydrochloric acid in F on the fragments of marble in A. After passing\r\nthe wash-bottle the gas enters the small tubulated retort, C, which\r\ncontains the nitrate in solution. For ordinary soils 100 grams are\r\nplaced in an extraction flask, plugged with cotton, and a layer of the\r\nsame material is placed over the soil for the purpose of securing an\r\neven distribution of the extracting liquid. This liquid is distilled\r\nwater containing in each liter one gram of calcium chlorid. The purpose\r\nof using the calcium chlorid is to prevent the soil from becoming\r\ncompacted which would render the extraction of the nitrate difficult.\r\nThe extracting liquid is allowed to fall drop by drop from a mariotte\r\nbottle until the filtrate amounts to 500 cubic centimeters. This volume\r\nis concentrated on a sand-bath until it is reduced to ten or fifteen\r\ncubic centimeters when it is transferred to a flat-bottomed dish and the\r\nevaporation finished over steam, care being taken not to allow the\r\ntemperature to exceed 100°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 75. SCHLOESING’S APPARATUS FOR NITRIC ACID.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother and more rapid method for dissolving the nitrate, may also be\r\npracticed. In a flask holding about one liter, place 220 grams of the\r\nsoil and 660 cubic centimeters of distilled water and shake vigorously,\r\nor enough water to make 660 cubic centimeters together with the moisture\r\nremaining in the air-dried sample taken. All the nitrates pass into\r\nsolution. Throw the contents of the flask into a filter and take 600\r\ncubic centimeters of the filtrate which will contain all the nitrates in\r\n200 grams of the sample taken. This filtrate is evaporated as described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIn the flat dish containing the dried nitrates, pour three or four cubic\r\ncentimeters of ferrous chlorid solution and stir with a small glass rod\r\nuntil complete solution of the nitrate takes place. By means of a small\r\nfunnel the solution is poured into C, and the capsule and funnel are\r\nwell rinsed with two cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid. The washing\r\nis repeated three times as above described, and once with one cubic\r\ncentimeter of water, which is added cautiously so as to form a layer\r\nover the surface of the heavier liquid. The tubulated flask is then\r\nconnected with the carbon dioxid apparatus, previously freed from air,\r\nand the gas allowed to flow evenly until the whole of the apparatus is\r\ncompletely air-free. The other details of the method are essentially the\r\nsame as those adopted by the Commission of French Agricultural Chemists\r\nwhich will be given below.\r\n\r\n=461. The French Agricultural Method.=—The Schloesing method as\r\npracticed by the French agricultural chemists is very slightly different\r\nfrom the procedure just described.[296] The process with soils is\r\ncarried on as follows:\r\n\r\nFive hundred grams of the soil are taken and introduced into a flask of\r\nabout two liters capacity and shaken thoroughly with a liter of\r\ndistilled water. The whole of the nitrates of the soil is thus passed\r\ninto solution. The solution is filtered and 400 cubic centimeters of the\r\nfiltrate are taken, which correspond to 200 grams of the soil. This\r\nliquid is evaporated in a flask, adding a fragment of paraffin to\r\nprevent foaming, until its volume is reduced to fifteen or twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters. It is afterwards transferred through a filter into a\r\ncapsule with a flat bottom in which the evaporation is finished on a\r\nsteam-bath, taking care that the temperature does not exceed 100°. An\r\nimportant precaution is, not to allow the contact of the water with the\r\nsoil to be too prolonged, to avoid the reduction of the nitrates which\r\ncould take place under the influence of the denitrifying organisms which\r\nare developed with so great a rapidity in moist earth. The apparatus in\r\nwhich the transformation of the nitrates into nitric oxid takes place is\r\nessentially that already described (Fig. 75). The carbon dioxid\r\ngenerator is connected by means of a rubber tube and a small wash-bottle\r\nto the small retort in which the reaction takes place, and from which\r\nthe exit tube leads to a mercury trough. The gas which is disengaged is\r\nreceived under a jar drawn out to a fine point in its upper part, which\r\ncarries about fifteen cubic centimeters of potash solution containing\r\ntwo parts of water to one of potash.\r\n\r\nThe operation is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nInto the small capsule which contains the dried matter, three or four\r\ncubic centimeters of ferrous chlorid are poured. By means of a stirring\r\nrod the residue sticking to the sides of the capsule is detached with\r\ncare and all the matter is thus collected in the bottom. By means of a\r\nsmall funnel the contents of the capsule are introduced into the retort.\r\nAbout two cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid are used for washing\r\nout the materials and this acid is also introduced into the retort. The\r\nwashing with hydrochloric acid is repeated three or four times, and\r\nfinally the apparatus is washed with one cubic centimeter of water,\r\nwhich is also poured in by the small funnel with great care, so that\r\nthis water may form a layer over the surface of the liquid. The\r\napparatus is now connected and filled completely with carbon dioxid.\r\nSince it is necessary that this gas should be completely free of air,\r\nthe flask, which generates it, is first filled with the acidulated water\r\nfrom the acid flask, and the air is thus almost totally displaced by the\r\nliquid. The evolution of carbon dioxid gas which follows, completely\r\nfrees the apparatus from air. When this is accomplished the retort is\r\nconnected with the rest of the apparatus and the gas allowed to pass for\r\nabout two minutes until the air is completely driven out of all the\r\nconnections. The current is arrested for a moment by pinching the rubber\r\ntube which conducts the carbon dioxid into the retort, and the vessel\r\nwhich is to receive the gas is then placed over the delivery-tube, this\r\nvessel being filled with mercury and a strong solution of potash. The\r\ncommunication between the retort and the carbon dioxid flask is broken\r\nand the flask is heated slightly by means of a small lamp. The first\r\nbubbles of gas evolved should be entirely absorbed by the potash. This\r\nwill be an indication of the complete absence of the air. When the\r\nliquid is in a state of ebullition the nitrogen dioxid is set free. The\r\nboiling is regulated in such a way that the evolution is regular and the\r\nliquid of the retort may not, by a too violent boiling, pass into the\r\nreceiver. The boiling is continued until the larger part of the liquid\r\nis distilled and only three or four cubic centimeters remain in the\r\nretort. At this time a few bubbles of carbon dioxid are allowed to flow\r\nthrough in order to cause to pass into the receiver the last traces of\r\nnitric oxid. The gas received is left for some minutes in contact with\r\nthe potash.\r\n\r\nAfterward in a small flask, G, the neck of which is drawn out to a fine\r\npoint, and carrying a bulb-tube, H, and a piece of rubber tubing, there\r\nare boiled twenty-five or thirty cubic centimeters of water for five or\r\nsix minutes in order to drive all the air out of the flask, and while\r\nthe boiling is continued the rubber tubing is fastened to the drawn-out\r\npart of the jar containing the nitric oxid. Within the rubber tubing the\r\ndrawn-out point is broken and the vapor of water is forced into the jar\r\nand drives before it the solution of potash which has filled the\r\ncapillary part of the drawn-out tube. As soon as the point is broken,\r\nthe boiling of the flask is stopped and by its cooling the nitric oxid\r\npasses into it. It is necessary to press the rubber tubing with the\r\nfingers in order that the passage of the gas into the flask be not too\r\nrapid. As the solution of potash rises in the bell-jar which contains\r\nthe nitric oxid near to the point where the rubber tubing covers its\r\ndrawn-out portion, the fingers are removed and a clamp put in their\r\nplace. There still remains a little nitric oxid in the flask and to\r\ndrive this out it is necessary to introduce five or six cubic\r\ncentimeters of pure hydrogen, which are allowed to pass over into the\r\nreceiving flask, by releasing the clamp in the same way as the nitric\r\noxid. The hydrogen being introduced in successive portions, finally\r\ncarries all the nitric oxid into the flask without allowing any of the\r\npotash to enter.\r\n\r\nThe flask containing the nitric oxid is now connected with a reservoir\r\nof oxygen. The oxygen is allowed to enter, bubble by bubble, by means of\r\ncooling the flask by immersion in water. The transformation of nitric\r\noxid into nitric acid is not entirely complete for twenty-four hours. It\r\nis necessary, therefore, to wait that long after the introduction of the\r\noxygen before determining the amount of nitric acid produced.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the flask are placed in a titration-jar, the flask being\r\nwashed two or three times and a few drops of tincture of litmus being\r\nadded. The nitric acid is then determined by a standard solution of\r\ncalcium hydroxid or some other standard alkali. From the titration the\r\ncontent of nitric acid is calculated.\r\n\r\nThe French Committee further suggests that this method may be modified\r\nin the way of making it more rapid by collecting the nitric acid in a\r\ngraduated tube filled with mercury and containing some potash. The\r\nvolume of the gas is determined and the pressure of the barometer and\r\nthe temperature observed, and the usual calculations made to reduce the\r\nvolume to zero and to a pressure of 760 millimeters of mercury. Each\r\ncubic centimeter of nitric oxid thus measured corresponds to 2.417\r\nmilligrams of nitric acid. The presence of organic matter does not\r\ninterfere with the determination of nitric acid by either of the methods\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\n=462. Modification of Warington.=—The method of procedure and\r\ndescription of apparatus used, as employed by Warington, are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe vessel in which the reaction takes place is a small tubulated\r\nreceiver, A (Fig. 76), about four centimeters in diameter, mounted and\r\nconnected as shown in the illustration. The delivery-tube dips into a\r\njar of mercury in a trough containing the same liquid. The long supply\r\nfunnel-tube _a_ is of small bore, holding in all only one-half cubic\r\ncentimeter. The connecting tube F, carrying a clamp, is also of small\r\ndiameter and serves to connect the apparatus with a supply of carbon\r\ndioxid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 76. WARINGTON’S APPARATUS FOR NITRIC ACID.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn practice, the supply-tube _a_ is first filled with strong\r\nhydrochloric acid and carbon dioxid passed through the apparatus until\r\nthe air is all expelled. This is indicated when a portion of the gas\r\ncollected over the mercury, is entirely absorbed by caustic alkali.\r\n\r\nAt this point the current of carbon dioxid is stopped by the clamp C,\r\nand a bath of calcium chlorid, B, heated to 140° is brought under the\r\nbulb A, until the latter is half immersed therein. The temperature of\r\nthe bath is maintained by a lamp. By allowing a few drops of\r\nhydrochloric acid to enter the receiver, the carbon dioxid is almost\r\nwholly expelled. The end of the delivery-tube is then connected with the\r\ntube, T, filled with mercury, and the apparatus is ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate, in which the nitric acid is to be determined, in a dry\r\nstate, is dissolved in two cubic centimeters of the ferrous chlorid\r\nsolution (one gram of iron in ten cubic centimeters), one cubic\r\ncentimeter of strong hydrochloric acid is added, and the whole is then\r\nintroduced into the receiver through the supply-tube, being followed by\r\nsuccessive rinsings with hydrochloric acid, each rinsing not exceeding\r\none-half cubic centimeter. The contents of the receiver are, in a few\r\nmoments, boiled to dryness; a little carbon dioxid is admitted before\r\ndryness is reached, and again afterwards to drive over all remains of\r\nnitric oxid. In the recovered gas the carbon dioxid is first absorbed by\r\ncaustic potash, and afterwards the nitric oxid by ferrous chlorid. All\r\nmeasurements of the gas are made in Frankland’s modification of\r\nRegnault’s apparatus. The carbon dioxid should be as free as possible\r\nfrom oxygen. The carbon dioxid generator is formed of two vessels, the\r\nlower one consisting of a bottle with a tubule in the side near the\r\nbottom; this bottle is supported in an inverted position and contains\r\nthe marble from which the gas is generated. The upper vessel consists of\r\na similar bottle standing upright and containing the hydrochloric acid\r\nrequired to act on the marble. The two vessels are connected by a glass\r\ntube passing from the side tubule of the upper vessel to the inverted\r\nmouth of the lower vessel. The acid from the upper vessel thus enters\r\nbelow the marble. Carbon dioxid is generated and removed at pleasure by\r\nopening a stop-cock attached to the side tubule of the lower vessel thus\r\nallowing hydrochloric acid to descend and come in contact with the\r\nmarble. A good Kipp’s generator of any approved form may also be used\r\ninstead of the simple apparatus, above described.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of marble used are previously boiled in water in a strong\r\nflask. After boiling has proceeded for some time, a rubber stopper is\r\nfixed in the neck of the flask and the flame removed. Boiling will then\r\ncontinue for some time in a partial vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloric acid is also well boiled and has dissolved in it a\r\nmoderate quantity of cuprous chlorid. As soon as the acid has been\r\nplaced in the upper reservoir, it is covered by a layer of oil. The\r\napparatus being thus charged is at once set in active work by opening\r\nthe stop-cock of the marble reservoir; the acid descends, enters the\r\nmarble reservoir, and the carbon dioxid produced drives out the air. As\r\nthe acid reservoir is kept on a higher level than the marble reservoir,\r\nthe latter is always under internal pressure, and leakage of air from\r\nwithout, into the apparatus, cannot occur.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the cuprous chlorid in the hydrochloric acid not only\r\ninsures the removal of dissolved oxygen, but affords an indication to\r\nthe eye of the maintenance of this condition. While the acid remains of\r\nan olive tint, oxygen is absent; but should the color change to a\r\nblue-green, more cuprous chlorid must be added. All the reagents\r\nemployed should be previously boiled.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure absolute freedom from air, the following\r\nmodifications on the above process have been adopted by Warington: The\r\napparatus having been mounted as described, the funnel-tube attached to\r\nthe bulb retort is filled with water, and the apparatus connected with\r\nthe carbon dioxid generator. Carbon dioxid is then passed through the\r\napparatus until a moderate stream of bubbles rises in the mercury\r\ntrough. The stop-cock is left in this position, and the admission of gas\r\nis controlled by the pinch-cock. The bath of calcium chlorid is so\r\nadjusted as to cause the bulb retort to be almost entirely submerged,\r\nand the temperature of the bath is kept at 130° to 140°. Small\r\nquantities of water are next admitted into the bulb and expelled as\r\nsteam in the current of carbon dioxid, the supply of this gas being shut\r\noff before the evaporation is entirely completed, so as to leave as\r\nlittle carbon dioxid as possible in the apparatus. Previous to very\r\ndelicate experiments it is advisable to introduce through the\r\nfunnel-tube a small quantity of potassium nitrate, ferrous chlorid, and\r\nhydrochloric acid, rinsing the tube with the latter reagent. Any trace\r\nof oxygen remaining in the apparatus is then consumed by the nitric oxid\r\nformed; and after boiling to dryness and driving out the nitric acid\r\nwith carbon dioxid, the apparatus is in a perfect condition for a\r\nquantitative experiment.\r\n\r\n=463. Preparation of the Materials to be Analyzed.=—According to\r\nWarington, soil extracts may be used without other preparation than\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nVegetable juices which coagulate when heated, require to be boiled and\r\nfiltered or else evaporated to a thin sirup, treated with alcohol, and\r\nfiltered. A clear solution being thus obtained, it is concentrated over\r\na water-bath to a minimum volume in a beaker of small size. As soon as\r\ncool, it is mixed with one cubic centimeter of a cold saturated solution\r\nof ferrous chlorid and one cubic centimeter of hydrochloric acid, both\r\nreagents having been boiled and cooled immediately before use.\r\n\r\nIn mixing with the reagents, care must be taken that bubbles of air are\r\nnot entangled, which is apt to occur with viscid extracts.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of ferrous chlorid mentioned is amply sufficient for most\r\nsoil extracts, but it is well to use two cubic centimeters in the first\r\nexperiment, the presence of a considerable excess of ferrous chlorid in\r\nthe retort being thus insured. With bulky vegetable extracts more\r\nferrous chlorid should be employed. To the sirup from twenty grams of\r\nmangel-wurzel sap, five cubic centimeters of ferrous chlorid and two\r\ncubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid are usually added.\r\n\r\n=464. Measurement of the Gas.=—The measurement of the gas was for some\r\ntime conducted by the use of concentrated potash for absorbing the\r\ncarbon dioxid, and ferrous chlorid for absorbing the nitric oxid. The\r\nuse of the ferrous chlorid, however, was found to introduce a source of\r\nerror. The treatment of the gas with oxygen and pyrogallol over potash\r\nhas therefore been substituted by Warington for its absorption by\r\nferrous chlorid.\r\n\r\nThe chief source of error attending the oxygen process lies in the small\r\nquantity of carbon monoxid produced during the absorption with\r\npyrogallol; this error becomes negligible if the oxygen be only used in\r\nsmall excess. The amount of oxygen employed can be regulated by the use\r\nof Bischof’s gas delivery-tube. This may be made of a test-tube having a\r\nsmall perforation half an inch from the mouth. The tube is partly filled\r\nwith oxygen over mercury, and its mouth is then closed by a finely\r\nperforated stopper made from a piece of wide tube and fitted tightly\r\ninto the test-tube by means of a covering of rubber. When this tube is\r\ninclined, the side perforation being downwards, the oxygen is discharged\r\nin small bubbles from the perforated stopper, while mercury enters\r\nthrough the opening. Using this tube, the supply of oxygen is perfectly\r\nunder control and can be stopped as soon as a fresh bubble ceases to\r\nproduce a red tinge on entering. Warington concludes his description by\r\nstating that in the reaction proposed by Schloesing the analyst has a\r\nmeans of determining a very small quantity of nitric acid with\r\nconsiderable accuracy, even in the presence of organic matter; but to\r\naccomplish this, the various simplifications consisting in the omission\r\nof the stream of carbon dioxid, and the collection of the gas over\r\ncaustic soda must be abandoned, and special precautions must be taken to\r\nexclude all traces of oxygen from the apparatus.\r\n\r\n=465. Spiegel’s Modification.=—Spiegel noticed inaccuracies in the\r\nresults of the ferrous chlorid method of estimating nitric acid when\r\ncarbon dioxid is used, which sometimes amounted to three per cent of the\r\nnitric acid present in the sample. The following suggestions are made by\r\nhim for the improvement of the process:[297]\r\n\r\nAs regards the use of carbon dioxid in the operation, the first\r\ndifficulty consists in obtaining it entirely free from air. By the use\r\nof small pieces of marble, which, before being placed in the Kipp\r\napparatus, are kept for a long while in boiling water, a product is\r\nobtained which, after thirty minutes of moderate evolution, leaves only\r\na trace of unabsorbed gas in contact with potash-lye. The apparatus used\r\nis illustrated in Fig. 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 77. SPIEGEL’S APPARATUS FOR NITRIC ACID.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA is a round flask of about 150 cubic centimeters capacity, furnished\r\nwith a well-fitting rubber stopper provided with two holes, one for the\r\nentrance of the funnel-tube B and the other for the delivery-tube C. The\r\ntube B ends about two centimeters above the bottom of A and carries a\r\nbulb-shaped funnel at its top capable of holding about fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters. The gas-tube D is ground into the bulb of B as shown in the\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nAfter the flask had been filled with the solution to be examined, carbon\r\ndioxid is conducted through D and the flask is heated to boiling until\r\nthe gas which escapes through C no longer contains any air. The\r\nmeasuring tube is brought over the end of the delivery-tube C, in the\r\nusual manner, but not shown in the figure. In the funnel of B are placed\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of previously prepared and boiled ferrous\r\nchlorid solution and this liquid is allowed to flow partly into A by\r\nlifting slightly the gas-tube, D. About forty cubic centimeters of\r\nconcentrated, boiled hydrochloric acid are afterwards added to it in the\r\nsame way. As soon as the liquid in the flask A is again boiling, the\r\nstream of carbon dioxid is shut off and allowed to flow again only\r\ntowards the end of the operation, when the contents of the flask are\r\nreduced almost to dryness. As will be seen from the above directions no\r\nunboiled liquids of any kind are to be used as reagents in the apparatus\r\ndescribed. If the flask A were made much smaller the efficiency of this\r\napparatus would be increased. It appears to have few, if any, advantages\r\nover Warington’s process.\r\n\r\n=466. Schulze-Tiemann Method.=—The modification of Schulze-Tiemann in\r\nthe ferrous salt method consists chiefly in the omission of the use of\r\ncarbon dioxid, and in the simplified form of apparatus, which permits\r\nrapid work and gives, also, according to some authorities, very exact\r\nand reliable results.[298] The extract, representing 500 grams of the\r\nfine soil, is reduced by evaporation to 100 cubic centimeters and placed\r\nin a glass flask, _A_ (Fig. 78), of 500 cubic centimeters capacity. The\r\nflask is closed with a rubber stopper, carrying two bent glass tubes\r\nwhich pass through it. The tube _a b c_ is drawn out into a point at _a_\r\nand reaches about two centimeters below the surface of the rubber\r\nstopper. The tube _e f g_ passes just to the lower surface of the rubber\r\nstopper. The two tubes mentioned are connected, by means of rubber tubes\r\nand pinch-cocks, with the tubes _d_ and _h_. The pinch-cocks at _c_ and\r\n_g_ must be capable of closing the tubes air-tight. The end of the tube\r\n_g h_ passes into a crystallizing dish, _B_, and is bent upward to a\r\npoint passing two to three centimeters into the measuring tube _C_. The\r\npoint within the tube is covered with a piece of rubber tubing. The\r\nmeasuring tube _C_ is divided into tenths of a cubic centimeter, and\r\ntogether with the crystallizing dish _B_, is filled with a ten per cent\r\nsolution of boiled soda-lye, which is obtained by dissolving 12.9 parts\r\nof sodium hydroxid in 100 parts of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 78. SCHULZE-TIEMANN’S NITRIC ACID APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe liquid which is to be examined for nitric acid, the pinch-cocks\r\nbeing opened and the tube _g h_ not dipping into the crystallizing dish,\r\nis boiled for one hour in order to drive the air out of the flask _A_.\r\nThe end of the tube _e f g h_ is then brought into the crystallizing\r\ndish containing the sodium hydroxid solution so that the steam escaping\r\nfrom the flask _A_, escapes partly through the tube _b c d_, and partly\r\nthrough the tube _f g h_, not allowing, however, the bubbles to enter\r\nthe measuring tube _C_. To determine whether the air is all expelled,\r\nthe pinch-cock at _g_ is closed and the soda-lye will thereupon rise to\r\n_g_ in case no air interferes. It is best to close the tube at _g_ first\r\nwith the thumb and finger and then the rise of the soda-lye to that\r\npoint can be determined by the impulse felt. The tube is then firmly\r\nclosed by means of the pinch-cock _g_. The rest of the steam is allowed\r\nto escape through the tube _a b c d_, and the evaporation is continued\r\nuntil the contents of the flask are evaporated to about ten cubic\r\ncentimeters. The flask into which the tube _c d_ dips, is filled with\r\nfreshly boiled water. The lamp is removed from the flask _A_, the\r\npinch-cock is closed, whereupon the tube _c d_ becomes filled with the\r\nfreshly boiled water. The measuring tube _C_, filled with freshly boiled\r\nsoda-lye is closed with the thumb and brought into the dish _B_, care\r\nbeing taken that no bubble of air enters. It is placed over the end of\r\nthe tube _g h_.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the external air will now flatten the rubber tubes at\r\n_c_ and _g_. The flask at the end of _c d_ holding freshly boiled water\r\nis then replaced with one filled with a nearly saturated solution of\r\nferrous chlorid containing some hydrochloric acid. The flask containing\r\nthe ferrous chlorid solution should be graduated so that the amount\r\nwhich is sucked into the flask _A_ can be determined. The pinch-cock _c_\r\nis opened and from fifteen to twenty cubic centimeters of the ferrous\r\nchlorid solution allowed to flow into _A_. The end of the tube _c d_ is\r\nthen placed in another flask containing strong hydrochloric acid, and\r\nthe latter allowed to flow into the tube in small quantities at a time\r\nuntil all the ferrous chlorid is washed out of the tube _b c d_ into\r\n_A_. At the point _b_ there is sometimes formed a little bubble of\r\nhydrochloric acid in the state of gas, which by heating the flask _A_\r\ncompletely disappears.\r\n\r\nThe flask _A_ is next warmed gently until the rubber tubes at the\r\npinch-cocks begin to assume their normal condition. The pinch-cock at\r\n_g_ is now replaced by the thumb and finger, and as soon as the pressure\r\nwithin the flask _A_ is somewhat stronger, caused by the nitric oxid gas\r\nevolved from the mixture, it is allowed to pass through the tube\r\n_e f g h_ and escape into the measuring cylinder _C_. By a manipulation\r\nof the finger and thumb at _g_, it is possible to prevent regurgitation\r\nof the sodium hydroxid into _A_, and at the same time to relieve the\r\npressure of the nitric oxid in _A_, which would be difficult to do by\r\nmeans of the pinch-cock alone.\r\n\r\nThe boiling of the liquid is continued until there is no longer any\r\nincrease of the volume of gas in the measuring cylinder _C_. After the\r\nend of the operation the tube _g h_ is removed from the dish _B_ and the\r\nmeasuring tube _C_ is closed by means of the thumb while its end is\r\nstill beneath the surface of the soda-lye, and it is shaken until all\r\ntraces of any hydrochloric acid, which may have escaped absorption, are\r\nremoved. It is then placed in a large glass cylinder filled with water\r\nat the temperature at which the volume of gas is to be read. After being\r\nkept at this constant temperature for about half an hour the volume of\r\nthe nitric oxid can be read. For this purpose the measuring cylinder _C_\r\nis sunk into the water of the large cylinder until the level of the\r\nliquids within and without the tube is the same. The usual correction\r\nfor pressure of the atmosphere, as determined by the barometer, and for\r\nthe tension of the aqueous vapor at the temperature at which the reading\r\nis made, is applied. The correction is made by means of the following\r\nformula:\r\n\r\n              V′ = (V × 273 × (B − f)) ÷ ((273 + t) × 760)\r\n\r\nIn this formula V′ denotes the volume of the gas at the temperature of\r\nzero, and at 760 millimeters barometric pressure; V the volume of the\r\ngas as read at the barometric pressure observed, B, and the temperature\r\nobserved, _t_, while _f_ denotes the tension of the aqueous vapor in\r\nmillimeters of mercury pressure at the observed temperature _t_. The\r\ntension of the aqueous vapor at temperatures from zero to 26°, expressed\r\nin millimeters of mercury, is given in the following table:\r\n\r\n                          ─────┬─────────────\r\n                          Temp.│ Tension in\r\n                            °  │mm. mercury.\r\n                          ─────┼─────────────\r\n                              0│          4.6\r\n                              1│          4.9\r\n                              2│          5.3\r\n                              3│          5.7\r\n                              4│          6.1\r\n                              5│          6.5\r\n                              6│          6.9\r\n                              7│          7.4\r\n                              8│          8.0\r\n                              9│          8.5\r\n                             10│          9.1\r\n                             11│          9.7\r\n                             12│         10.4\r\n                             13│         11.1\r\n                             14│         11.9\r\n                             15│         12.7\r\n                             16│         13.5\r\n                             17│         14.4\r\n                             18│         15.3\r\n                             19│         16.3\r\n                             20│         17.4\r\n                             21│         18.5\r\n                             22│         19.6\r\n                             23│         20.9\r\n                             24│         22.2\r\n                             25│         23.5\r\n                             26│         25.0\r\n                          ─────┴─────────────\r\n\r\nFrom the gas volume reduced by the above formula the nitric acid is\r\ncalculated as follows:\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of nitric oxid weighs at 0° and 760 millimeters\r\nbarometric pressure 1.343 milligrams.\r\n\r\nSince two molecules of NO (molecular weight sixty) correspond to one\r\nmolecule of N₂O₅ (108) we have the following equation: 60 : 108 = 1.343\r\n: x. Whence x = 2.417 milligrams, the weight of nitric acid\r\ncorresponding to one cubic centimeter of nitric oxid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 79. DE KONICK’S APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 80. END OF DELIVERY-TUBE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=467. DeKonick’s Modification of Schloesing’s Method.=—This modification\r\nconsists in an arrangement of the gas delivery-tube, whereby the\r\nregurgitation of the water in the measuring burette into the evolution\r\nflask is prevented by a device for sealing the delivery-tube with\r\nmercury.[299] The apparatus is arranged as shown in Fig. 79. The flask\r\nin which the decomposition takes place is provided with a long neck,\r\ninto which a side tube is sealed and bent upwards, carrying a small\r\nfunnel attached to it by rubber tubing. The piece of rubber tubing\r\ncarries a pinch-cock, by means of which the solution containing the\r\nnitrate and hydrochloric acid can be introduced into the flask. The\r\nsmall gas delivery-tube is arranged as shown in the figure, and carries\r\nat the end next the burette a device shown in Fig. 80. The cork\r\nrepresented in this device has radial notches cut in it, so as to permit\r\nof a free communication between the water in the burette and in the\r\npneumatic trough. The open end of the burette, when the apparatus is\r\nmounted ready for use, rests on the notched surface of the cork, and the\r\nend of the delivery-tube is placed in the crystallizing dish resting on\r\nthe bottom of the pneumatic trough.\r\n\r\nThe end of the delivery-tube, as indicated, has fused onto it a vertical\r\ntube open at both ends and six to seven centimeters in length, and\r\ncarrying the notched cork already described. The crystallizing dish in\r\nthe bottom of the pneumatic trough is filled with mercury until the\r\npoint of union of the delivery-tube with the vertical end is sealed to\r\nthe depth of a few millimeters. As the gas is evolved it bubbles up\r\nthrough the mercury into the measuring tube and the displaced water\r\npasses out through the notches in the cork. Should any back pressure\r\nsupervene the mercury at once rises in the delivery-tube which is of\r\nsuch a length as to prevent its entrance into the flask. The operation\r\ncan then be carried on with absolute safety.\r\n\r\nTo make an estimation there are placed in the flask about forty cubic\r\ncentimeters of ferrous chlorid solution containing about 200 grams of\r\niron to the liter, and also an equal volume of hydrochloric acid of one\r\nand one-tenth specific gravity. The side tube is also filled up to the\r\nfunnel with the acid. The contents of the flask are boiled until all air\r\nis expelled, which can be determined by holding a test-tube filled with\r\nwater over the end of the delivery-tube. The solution containing the\r\nnitrate is next placed in the funnel, the pinch-cock opened and the\r\nliquid allowed to run into the flask by means of the partial vacuum\r\nproduced by stopping the boiling and allowing the mercury to rise in the\r\ndelivery-tube. All the solution is washed into the flask by successive\r\nrinsings of the funnel with hydrochloric acid, being careful to allow no\r\nbubble of air to enter. The contents of the flask are again raised to\r\nthe boiling-point and the nitric oxid evolved collected in the\r\nnitrometer. The solution examined should contain enough nitrate to\r\nafford from sixty to eighty cubic centimeters of gas. Without refilling\r\nthe flask, from eight to nine determinations can be made by regenerating\r\nthe ferrous chlorid by treatment with zinc chlorid. Care must be\r\nexercised not to add the zinc chlorid in excess, otherwise ammonia and\r\nnot nitric oxid will be produced. The side tube and funnel must also be\r\ncarefully freed from zinc chlorid by washing with hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n=468. Schmidt’s Process.=—In the case of a water, or the aqueous extract\r\nof a soil, according to the content of nitric acid, from fifty to one\r\nhundred cubic centimeters are evaporated to thirty cubic centimeters,\r\nand the residue sucked into the generating flask of the apparatus, Fig.\r\n81, and, with the rinsings with distilled water, evaporated again to\r\nfrom twenty to thirty cubic centimeters, and the flask then connected,\r\nas shown in the figure, to a Schliff measuring apparatus, B.[300] This\r\napparatus is previously filled to _i_ with mercury, and the bulb _g_\r\nconnected with _k_ by a rubber tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 81. SCHMIDT’S APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is then filled with a twenty per cent, previously boiled\r\nand still warm, caustic soda solution until the bulb _g_ is partially\r\nfilled when raised a little above the cock _h_. Then _h_ is closed and\r\n_g_ held, by an appropriate support, on about the same level with _h_.\r\nThe cock at _b_ is then closed and _e_ opened. Meanwhile the ebullition\r\nin the flask is continued, and the air bubbles rising in the Schliff\r\napparatus are removed, from time to time, by carefully opening _h_ and\r\nraising _g_. When bubbles no longer come over, the cock at _e_ is closed\r\nand at _b_ opened, and the steam issuing at _a_ is conducted through a\r\nmixture of ferrous chlorid and strong hydrochloric acid to free it, as\r\nfar as possible, from air. When the contents of the flask have been\r\nevaporated to about five cubic centimeters, _b_ is closed and the lamp\r\nat once removed.\r\n\r\nBy carefully opening _b_ about ten cubic centimeters of a mixture of\r\nferrous chlorid and hydrochloric acid are allowed to enter the flask,\r\nwhen _b_ is closed and the flask slowly heated until the positive\r\npressure is restored. The pinch-cock _e_ is then opened and the contents\r\nof the flask evaporated nearly to dryness. The cock _e_ is again closed\r\nand the flame removed. Another quantity (fifteen cubic centimeters) of\r\nferrous chlorid and hydrochloric acid solution is sucked into the flask\r\nand the process of distillation repeated, whereby the whole of the\r\nnitric oxid is collected in _h_. The nitric oxid evolved is measured in\r\nthe usual way and calculated to nitric acid, one cubic centimeter of\r\nnitrogen dioxid being equal to 2.417 milligrams of nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=469. Merits of the Ferrous Chlorid Process.=—The possibility of an\r\naccurate determination of nitrates; by decomposition with a ferrous salt\r\nin presence of an excess of acid, has been established by many years of\r\nexperience and by the testimony of many analysts. The method is\r\napplicable especially where the quantity of nitrate is not too small and\r\nwhen organic matter is present. In the case of minute quantities of\r\nnitrate, however, the process is inapplicable and must give way to some\r\nof the colorimetric methods to be hereafter described.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the apparatus modern practice has led to the preference of\r\nthat form which does not require the use of carbon dioxid for displacing\r\nthe air. Steam appears to be quite as effective as carbon dioxid and is\r\nmuch more easily employed. That form of apparatus should be used which\r\nis the simplest in construction and has the least cubical content.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of the evolved gas is most simply made by collecting\r\nover lye in an azotometer, reading the volume, noting the reading of the\r\nbarometer and thermometer and then reducing to standard conditions of\r\npressure and temperature by the customary calculations. Where a very\r\nstrong lye is used the tension of the aqueous vapor may be neglected.\r\nWhile every analyst should have a thorough knowledge of the ferrous\r\nchlorid method and the principles on which it is based it can not be\r\ncompared in simplicity to the later methods with pure nitrates which are\r\nbased on the conversion of the nitric acid into ammonia by the action of\r\nnascent hydrogen. In accuracy, moreover, it does not appear to have any\r\nmarked advantage over the reduction methods.\r\n\r\n=470. Mercury and Sulfuric Acid Method.=—This simple and accurate method\r\nof determining nitric acid in the absence of organic matter is known as\r\nthe Crum-Frankland process.[301]\r\n\r\nThe method rests on the principle of converting nitric acid into nitric\r\noxid by the action of mercury in the presence of sulfuric acid. The\r\noperation as at first described is conducted in a glass jar eight inches\r\nlong by one and a half inches in diameter filled with mercury and\r\ninverted in a trough containing the same liquid. The nitrate to be\r\nexamined, in a solid form, is passed into the tube together with three\r\ncubic centimeters of water and five of sulfuric acid. With occasional\r\nshaking, two hours are allowed for the disengagement of the gas, which\r\nis then measured.\r\n\r\n=471. Warington’s Modification.=—A graduated shaking tube is employed\r\nwhich allows the nitrate solution and oil of vitriol to be brought to a\r\ndefinite volume. The nitrate solution, with rinsings, is always two\r\ncubic centimeters and enough sulfuric acid is added to increase the\r\nvolume to five cubic centimeters. The sulfuric acid should give no gas\r\nwhen shaken with distilled water. Any gas given off in the apparatus\r\nbefore shaking, is not expelled but is included in the final result. The\r\npersistent froth sometimes noticed where some kinds of organic matter\r\nare present, is reduced by the addition of a few drops of hot water\r\nthrough the stop-cock of the apparatus. The nitric oxid is finally\r\nmeasured in Frankland’s modification of Regnault’s apparatus.\r\n\r\nThis method, accurate for pure nitrates, unfortunately fails in the\r\npresence of any considerable amount of organic matter.\r\n\r\nAccording to Warington’s observations the presence of chlorids is no\r\nhindrance to the accurate determination of both nitric and nitrous acids\r\nby the mercury method. This simplifies the operation as carried on by\r\nFrankland who directs that any chlorin present, be removed before the\r\ndetermination of the nitric acid is commenced.\r\n\r\n=472. Noyes’ Method.=—In the analyses made by Noyes for the National\r\nBoard of Health, the Crum-Frankland method was employed.[302] The\r\napparatus used was essentially that which is now known as Lunge’s\r\nnitrometer and it will be described in the next paragraph. No correction\r\nis made by Noyes for the tension of aqueous vapor in the measurement of\r\nthe nitric oxid because of the moderate dilution of the sulfuric acid by\r\nthe liquid holding the nitric compounds in solution. The chlorin was not\r\nremoved from the dry residue of the evaporated water as its presence in\r\nmoderate quantity does not interfere with the accuracy of the process.\r\nIn order to obtain the amount of nitrogen in the form of nitrates, the\r\ntotal volume of nitric oxid must be diminished by that due to nitrites\r\npresent, which must be determined in a separate analysis. The method of\r\nmanipulation is given in the following paragraph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 82. LUNGE’S NITROMETER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=473. Lunge’s Nitrometer.=—The apparatus employed by Noyes, in a\r\nsomewhat more elaborate form, is known as Lunge’s nitrometer.[303] This\r\napparatus is shown in Fig. 82. It consists of a burette, _a_, divided\r\ninto one-fifth cubic centimeters. At its upper end it is expanded into a\r\ncup-shaped funnel attached by a three-way glass stop-cock. Below, the\r\nburette is joined to a plain tube, _b_, of similar size, by means of\r\nrubber tubing. The apparatus is first filled with mercury through the\r\ntube _b_, the stop-cock being so adjusted as to allow the mercury to\r\nfill the cup at the top of _a_. The cock is then turned until the\r\nmercury in the cup flows out through the side tube carrying the rubber\r\ntube and clamp. The three-way cock is closed, and the solution\r\ncontaining the nitrate placed in the cup. By lowering the tube _b_ and\r\nopening the cock the liquid is carefully passed into _a_, being careful\r\nto close the cock before all the liquid has passed out of the cup. By\r\nrepeated rinsings with pure concentrated sulfuric acid, every particle\r\nof the nitric compound is finally introduced into _a_, together with a\r\nlarge excess of sulfuric acid. The total volume of the introduced liquid\r\nshould not exceed ten cubic centimeters. The mixture of the mercury,\r\nnitric compound, and sulfuric acid is effected by detaching _a_ from its\r\nsupport, compressing the rubber connection between _a_ and _b_, placing\r\n_a_ nearly in a horizontal position, and quickly bringing it into a\r\nvertical position with vigorous shaking.\r\n\r\nAfter about five minutes the reaction is complete, and the level of the\r\nliquids in the two tubes is so adjusted as to compensate for the\r\ndifference in specific gravity between the acid mixture in _a_ and the\r\nmercury in _b_; in other words, the mercury column in _b_ should stand\r\nabove the mercury column in _a_ one-seventh of the length of the acid\r\nmixture in _a_. This secures atmospheric pressure on the nitric oxid\r\nwhich has been collected in _a_. The measured volume of nitric oxid\r\nshould be reduced to 0° and 760 millimeters barometric pressure. Each\r\ncubic centimeter of nitric oxid thus obtained corresponds to 1.343\r\nmilligrams NO; 2.417 milligrams N₂O₅; 4.521 milligrams KNO₃; 1.701\r\nmilligrams N₂O₃; 2.820 milligrams HNO₃; and 3.805 milligrams NaNO₃.\r\n\r\n=474. Lunge’s Improved Apparatus.=—Lunge has lately improved his\r\napparatus for generating and measuring gases and extended its\r\napplicability.[304] The part of it designed to measure the volume of a\r\ngas is the same in all cases. For generating the gas, the apparatus\r\nvaries according to the character of the substance under examination.\r\n\r\nThe measuring apparatus is shown in Fig. 83. It is composed essentially\r\nof three tubes, conveniently mounted on a wooden holder with a box base\r\nfor securing any spilled mercury. The support is not shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThe tubes A, B, C, are mutually connected by means of a three-way tube\r\nand rubber tubing with very thick walls to safely hold the mercury\r\nwithout expansion. In the middle of the measuring tube A, is found a\r\nbulb of seventy cubic centimeters capacity. Above and below the bulb the\r\ntube is divided into tenths of a cubic centimeter, and its diameter is\r\nsuch, _viz._, 11.3 millimeters, that each cubic centimeter occupies a\r\nlength of one centimeter. The upper end of A is closed with a glass cock\r\nwith two oblique perforations, by means of which communication can be\r\nestablished at will, either through _e_ with the apparatus for\r\ngenerating the gas, or through _d_ with the absorption apparatus, or the\r\nopening be completely closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE. 83.\r\n\r\n  LUNGE’S IMPROVED APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe volume of air under the observed conditions which would measure\r\nexactly 100 cubic centimeters at 0° and 760 millimeters pressure of\r\nmercury, is calculated by the formula\r\n\r\n               V = (100(273 + _t_)760)/(273(_b_ − _f_));\r\n\r\nwhere _t_ equals observed temperature, _b_ the barometric pressure less\r\nthe correction noted above and _f_ the tension of the vapor of water\r\nunder existing conditions. For example:\r\n\r\n                       Let the temperature be 18°\r\n                       Barometric reading     755\r\n                       Correction for _t_       2\r\n                       Corrected barometer    753\r\n                       Vapor of water tension  16\r\n\r\n          Then V = (100(273 + 18)760)/(273(753 − 16)) = 109.9.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that 109.9 cubic centimeters of air would occupy a volume\r\nof 100 cubic centimeters when subjected to standard conditions.\r\n\r\nThe tubes A, B, and C are filled with mercury of which about two and a\r\nhalf kilograms will be required. By means of the leveling tube B, the\r\nstopper in C being opened, the mercury in C is brought exactly to 109.9\r\ncubic centimeters. The stopper in C is then closed, mercury poured into\r\nD, which is then closed with a rubber stopper, carrying a small glass\r\ntube as indicated in the figure.\r\n\r\nThe leveling tube B serves to regulate the pressure on the gas in A and\r\nthis is secured by depressing or elevating it as the case may require.\r\n\r\nThe tube for reducing the volume to standard conditions of temperature\r\nand pressure, _viz._, 0° and 760 millimeters of mercury, is shown in C.\r\nIn its narrow part which has the same internal diameter as A it is\r\ngraduated into tenths of a cubic centimeter. The upper end of C is\r\nfurnished with a heavy glass neck D surmounted by a glass cup. In the\r\nneck is placed a ground-glass stopper, carrying a groove below, which\r\ncorresponds to a similar groove above in the side of the neck whereby\r\ncommunication can be established at will between the interior of C and\r\nthe exterior. The joint is also sealed by pouring mercury into D as is\r\nshown in the figure. When the stopper is well ground and greased the\r\nreduction tube may be raised or lowered as much as may be necessary\r\nwithout any danger of escape or entrance of gas. To determine the\r\nposition of the reduction tube C the reading of the barometer and\r\nthermometer at room temperature is taken. From the reading of the\r\nbarometer subtract one millimeter if the temperature be below 12°, two\r\nmillimeters at a temperature from 12° to 19°, three from 20° to 25°, and\r\nfour above 25°.\r\n\r\nWhen a gas has been introduced into the measuring tube A it is brought\r\nto the volume which it would assume under standard conditions by\r\nadjusting the tube C in such a way as to bring the level of mercury in C\r\nand A to the same point and the level of the mercury in C is exactly at\r\n100 cubic centimeters. The gas in A is then at the volume which it would\r\noccupy under standard conditions and this volume can be directly read.\r\nThis adjustment is secured by moving the tubes B and C up or down. If\r\ngases are to be measured wet, a drop of water should be put on the side\r\nof the upper part of C, and, if dry, of sulfuric acid, before the\r\nadjustment for temperature and pressure.\r\n\r\n=475. Method of Manipulation.=—By the action of mercury in the presence\r\nof sulfuric acid, the nitrogen in nitrates, nitrites, nitrosulfates,\r\nnitroses, nitrocellulose, nitroglycerol, and the greater number of\r\nexplosives, may be obtained and measured as nitric oxid. The nitrogen\r\ncompounds are decomposed in the apparatus shown in Fig. 84.\r\n\r\nTo make an analysis, the apparatus is filled with mercury, through F,\r\nuntil the two openings in the cock and _i_ are entirely occupied with\r\nthat liquid. The cock _h_ is then closed, and the nitrogen compound, in\r\nsolution, introduced through _g_, care being taken that no air enters\r\n_g_ when F is depressed and _h_ opened to admit the sample. The funnel\r\n_g_ is washed several times with a few drops of sulfuric acid, which are\r\nsuccessively introduced into G. The total liquid introduced should not\r\nexceed ten to fifteen cubic centimeters, of which the greater part\r\nshould be sulfuric acid. The rubber tube connecting G and F is carefully\r\nclosed with a clamp and G violently shaken for a few minutes until no\r\nfurther evolution of nitric oxid takes place. In shaking, the apparatus\r\nshould be so held as to prevent the escape of the mercury from the small\r\ntube _i_ by keeping it closed with the finger or drawing over it a\r\nrubber cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 84.\r\n\r\n  LUNGE’S ANALYTIC APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter the evolution of the gas has ceased, the tube _e_, Fig. 83, is\r\nbrought into contact with _i_, Fig. 84, and the two are joined by a\r\ntight-fitting piece of rubber tubing in such a way as to exclude any\r\nparticle of air. The tube F, Fig. 84, is lifted and B and C, Fig. 83,\r\ndepressed. On carefully opening the cocks _h_ and _b_ and bringing _i_\r\nand _e_ into union, the gas is passed from G into A. When all the gas\r\nhas entered A and the acid mixture from G has reached _b_ the latter is\r\nclosed, and also _h_. The apparatus G is disconnected and removed. The\r\ngas in A is then reduced to normal conditions by manipulating the\r\nreduction tube C in the manner already described.\r\n\r\nThe gas in A is measured dry by reason of having been generated in\r\npresence of rather strong sulfuric acid. Consequently, for this\r\noperation the adjustment of the volume of gas in C should be made in\r\ncontact with a drop of strong sulfuric acid. In order to make the\r\nreadings, a quantity of material must be taken which will give less than\r\nthirty or from 100 to 140 cubic centimeters of nitric oxid.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of the different compounds of nitric acid corresponding\r\nto the number of cubic centimeters of nitric oxid, measured under\r\nstandard conditions, are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                                         CORRESPONDING TO\r\n                             ————————————  ————————————  ————————————\r\n     Cubic       Weight in      N₂O₃ in       HNO₃ in      NaNO₃ in\r\n  centimeters   milligrams.   milligrams.   milligrams.   milligrams.\r\n    of NO.\r\n       1               1.343         1.701         2.820         3.805\r\n       2               2.682         3.402         5.640         7.610\r\n       3               4.029         5.103         8.460        11.415\r\n       4               5.372         6.804        11.280        15.220\r\n       5               6.715         8.506        14.100        19.025\r\n       6               8.058        10.206        16.920        22.830\r\n       7               9.401        11.907        19.740        26.635\r\n       8              10.744        13.608        22.560        30.440\r\n       9              12.087        15.309        25.380        34.245\r\n\r\n=476. Utility of the Method.=—Where it is desirable that the nitric oxid\r\nmethod be used, and at the same time heating be avoided, the\r\ndecomposition of a nitrate by means of metallic mercury and sulfuric\r\nacid affords a convenient and accurate procedure. But, as a rule, there\r\nis no objection to the application of the lamp, and in such cases the\r\nmercury method appears to have no advantage over the ferrous chlorid\r\nprocess. Nevertheless, in the hands of a skilled worker the results are\r\nreliable, and the process is a quicker one, on the whole, than by\r\ndistillation with ferrous chlorid and hydrochloric acid. This method,\r\nhowever, can not be recommended as in any way superior to the reduction\r\nmethods to be hereinafter described.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ESTIMATION OF NITRIC ACID BY OXIDATION OF A COLORED SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n=477. Method of Boussingault.=—The process for the estimation of nitric\r\nacid by the decoloration of a solution of indigo is due originally to\r\nBoussingault.[305] In this method the extract, obtained by washing\r\nslowly 200 grams of soil until the filtrate amounts to 300 cubic\r\ncentimeters, is evaporated until its volume is no greater than two or\r\nthree cubic centimeters, and it is transferred to a test-tube, with\r\nwashings, and again evaporated in the tube until the volume is not\r\ngreater than that last mentioned. A few drops of solution of indigo are\r\nadded, and then two cubic centimeters of pure hydrochloric acid; the\r\nwhole is then heated. As the color of the indigo disappears more is\r\nadded. When the color ceases to fade, the liquid in the test-tube is\r\nconcentrated by boiling. If concentration fail to destroy the blue or\r\ngreen color, another one-half cubic centimeter of hydrochloric acid is\r\nintroduced. The reaction is completed when neither concentration nor\r\nfresh addition of hydrochloric acid destroys the excess of indigo\r\npresent. The color produced by a small excess of indigo is a bright\r\nsap-green; this tint is the final reaction sought. The small excess of\r\nindigo necessary to produce a green color is deducted in every\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nWhen more than mere traces of organic matter are present, Boussingault\r\nadvises that the nitric acid be first separated by distillation and then\r\nreduced by the indigo solution. For this purpose the concentrated\r\nsolution of the nitrate, two or three cubic centimeters, is placed in a\r\nsmall tubulated retort with two grams of manganese dioxid in fine\r\npowder. The retort is next half filled with fragments of broken glass,\r\nover which is poured one cubic centimeter of concentrated sulfuric acid.\r\nThe retort is heated carefully by means of a small flame, which is kept\r\nin motion so as to successively come in contact with all parts of the\r\nbottom of the retort. The distillate is received in a graduated\r\ntest-tube which is kept cool. The distillation is continued until the\r\nvapors of sulfuric acid begin to appear. The apparatus is allowed to\r\ncool, the stopper of the retort removed, two cubic centimeters of water\r\nintroduced, and the distillation again made until fumes of sulfuric acid\r\nare again seen. The distillation with water is made twice in order to\r\nremove every trace of nitric acid from the retort. The distillate is\r\nneutralized with a solution of potassium hydroxid and concentrated to\r\ntwo cubic centimeters, and the nitric acid estimated in the manner\r\nalready described. The manganese dioxid used should be previously well\r\nwashed and the sulfuric must be free of nitric acid.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Indigo Solution._—Fifty grams of indigo in fine\r\npowder are digested for twenty-four hours, at 40°, in a liter of\r\ndistilled water. The water is then poured off and replaced with a fresh\r\nsupply. After the second decantation the residue is treated with 750\r\ncubic centimeters of equal parts of water and pure concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid and boiled for an hour. After cooling, the undissolved\r\nportion is collected on a filter and washed at first with hot, and\r\nafterwards with cold water, until the filtrate is no longer colored and\r\nis free of acid. The dried residue is treated with ether under a\r\nbell-jar, or in a continuous extraction apparatus, until the ether is\r\nonly of a faint blue tint. The fifty grams of indigo at first taken will\r\ngive about twenty-five grams of the purified article, which, however,\r\nwill still leave a little ash on combustion.\r\n\r\n_Solution in Sulfuric Acid._—Five grams of the purified indigo are\r\nplaced in a flask having a ground-glass stopper, treated with\r\ntwenty-five grams of fuming sulfuric acid, and allowed to digest two or\r\nthree days at a temperature of from 50° to 60°. From seventy to 200\r\ndrops of the solution thus made are placed in 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater for use in the process.\r\n\r\n_Standardization of the Indigo Solution._—The solution as prepared above\r\nis standardized by a solution of one gram of pure potassium nitrate in\r\n1,000 cubic centimeters of distilled water. The oxidation of the indigo\r\nsolution is accomplished as described above. For this strength of\r\nstandard nitrate solution two cubic centimeters are taken corresponding\r\nto two milligrams of potassium nitrate. The indigo solution for this\r\nstrength should have only twenty drops of the sulfuric acid solution of\r\nindigo to 100 cubic centimeters of water. If twenty grams of potassium\r\nnitrate are taken for 1,000 cubic centimeters of the standard solution\r\nthen 200 drops of the sulfindigotic acid should be used to 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water.\r\n\r\n=478. Method of Marx.=—As usually practiced, the indigo method is\r\nconducted according to the variation described by Marx.[306] There are\r\nrequired for the process the following reagents and apparatus:\r\n\r\n_a._ A solution of pure potassium nitrate containing 1.8724 grams per\r\nliter. One cubic centimeter of the solution is equivalent to one\r\nmilligram of nitric anhydrid (N₂O₅).\r\n\r\n_b._ A solution of the best indigo carmine in water which should be\r\napproximately standardized by solution in the manner described\r\nhereafter, and then diluted so that six to eight cubic centimeters equal\r\none milligram of nitric acid.\r\n\r\n_c._ Chemically pure sulfuric acid of specific gravity 1.842, perfectly\r\nfree from sulfurous and arsenious acids and nitrogen oxids.\r\n\r\n_d._ Several thin flasks of about 200 cubic centimeters capacity.\r\n\r\n_e._ A small cylindrical measure holding fifty cubic centimeters and\r\ndivided into cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n_f._ A Mohr’s burette divided into tenths of a cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\n_g._ A twenty-five cubic centimeter pipette or another burette.\r\n\r\n_h._ A five cubic centimeter pipette divided into cubic centimeters or\r\nhalf cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n_i._ A measuring flask of 250 cubic centimeters capacity.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Trial._—Twenty-five cubic centimeters of the sample are\r\ntransferred to a flask; the fifty cubic centimeter measure is filled\r\nwith sulfuric acid and the burette with indigo solution. The sulfuric\r\nacid is added to the sample all at once, shaken for a moment, and the\r\nindigo run in as quickly as possible with shaking until a permanent\r\ngreenish tint is produced. If the sample do not require more than twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of indigo solution of the above strength, it can be\r\ntitrated directly, otherwise it must be diluted with a proper quantity\r\nof pure water, and subjected again to the preliminary trial.\r\n\r\n_The Actual Titration._—(1) Twenty-five cubic centimeters of the sample\r\nproperly diluted if necessary, are measured and poured into a flask, and\r\nas much indigo as was used in the preliminary trial, is added; a\r\nquantity of sulfuric acid, equal in volume to the liquid in the flask,\r\nis added all at once, the mixture shaken, and indigo solution run in\r\nquickly out of the burette until the liquid remains permanently of a\r\ngreenish tint.\r\n\r\n(2) The last experiment is repeated as often as may be necessary adding\r\nto the water at first half a cubic centimeter less indigo than the total\r\nquantity used previously, afterwards proceeding as in (1) until the\r\nfinal test shows too little indigo used.\r\n\r\n(3) From the rough titration of the indigo, calculate the amount of\r\npotassium nitrate solution corresponding with the indigo solution used\r\nin (2), multiply the result by ten, transfer this quantity of the\r\nstandard nitrate solution to a 250 cubic centimeter flask, fill with\r\npure water to the mark, and titrate twenty-five cubic centimeters of\r\nthis fluid with indigo as in (2). If the quantity of indigo solution\r\nused is nearly the same as that required in (2), its exact value may be\r\ncalculated, but if it is not, another nitrate solution may be made up in\r\nthe 250 cubic centimeter flask, more closely resembling the sample in\r\nstrength, and the titration with the indigo solution must be repeated.\r\n\r\n(4) If the water contain any considerable amount of organic matter, it\r\nmust first be destroyed by potassium permanganate. In this case, the\r\nestimation of the organic matter and nitric acid may be conveniently\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nThe use of permanganate in the above case is likely to introduce an\r\nerror as has been shown by Warington. The method therefore can not be\r\nrecommended in the presence of organic matter.\r\n\r\n=479. Method of Warington.=—The modification of the indigo method as\r\nused by Warington, applicable only in absence of organic matter, is the\r\none chiefly employed in England.[307]\r\n\r\nInstead of the ordinary indigo of commerce, indigotin is used. The\r\nnormal solution of the coloring matter is made of such a strength as to\r\nbe equivalent to a solution of potassium nitrate containing 0.14 gram of\r\nnitrogen per liter. Where large quantities of the coloring matter are to\r\nbe used it is advisable to prepare it about four times the strength\r\ngiven above and then dilute it as required. Four grams of sublimed\r\nindigotin will furnish more than two liters of the color solution.\r\n\r\nThe solution is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nFour grams of indigotin are digested for a few hours with five times\r\nthat weight of Nordhausen sulfuric acid, diluted with water, filtered,\r\nand made up to a volume of two liters. The strength of the indigotin\r\nsolution is determined with a solution of potassium nitrate of the\r\nstrength mentioned above. The process is performed as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom ten to twenty cubic centimeters of the standard nitrate solution\r\nare placed in a wide-mouthed flask of about 150 cubic centimeters\r\ncapacity. A portion of the indigotin solution is next added, such as\r\nwill be deemed sufficient for the process, and the whole is well mixed.\r\nStrong sulfuric acid is next measured out from a burette into a\r\ntest-tube, in volume equal to the united volumes of the nitrate solution\r\nand indigotin. The whole of the sulfuric acid is then poured as quickly\r\nas possible, into the solution in the flask and rapidly mixed, and the\r\nflask transferred to a calcium chlorid bath, the temperature of which\r\nshould be maintained at 140°. It is essential to the success of the\r\noperation that the sulfuric acid should be mixed with the greatest\r\nrapidity. It should be poured in at once and the whole well shaken\r\nwithout waiting for the test-tube containing the acid, to drain. The\r\nflask should be covered by a watch-glass while it is held in the bath.\r\nAs soon as the larger part of the indigotin is oxidized the flask in the\r\nbath should be gently rotated. With very weak solutions of nitrate it\r\nmay be necessary sometimes to keep the flask in the bath for five\r\nminutes. When the indigo color is quickly discharged it shows the\r\npresence of nitric acid in considerable excess and a considerably larger\r\nquantity of indigo must be taken in the next experiment. The experiments\r\nare continued until just the quantity of indigo necessary to consume the\r\nnitric acid is taken, the amount of indigo being in very slight excess,\r\nnot exceeding one-tenth cubic centimeter of the indigo solution used.\r\nThe tint produced by the small excess of indigo remaining is best seen\r\nby filling the flask with water. On substances of approximately known\r\nstrength about four experiments are usually necessary to determine the\r\namount of indigo to be taken, but with unknown substances a larger\r\nnumber may be necessary.\r\n\r\nUsually in determinations of this kind it is directed to use double the\r\nvolume of sulfuric acid mentioned above. In this case not only is the\r\nquantity of indigo oxidized much greater than with a smaller portion of\r\nacid, but the prejudicial effect of organic matter is also greater than\r\nwhen the smaller quantity of acid is employed.\r\n\r\nAn indigo solution standardized as above is strictly to be used for a\r\nsolution of nitrate of the strength employed during the standardization.\r\nThe quantity of indigo oxidized in proportion to the nitric acid present\r\ndiminishes as the nitrate solution becomes more dilute. Instead of\r\ndetermining this during each series of experiments it may be estimated\r\nonce for all and a table of corrections used.\r\n\r\nThe following table is based upon experimental determinations:\r\n\r\n Strength of  Indigo   Difference   Nitrogen    Difference   Difference\r\n    niter    required,  between   corresponding between the    in the\r\n  solution     cubic   amounts of to one cubic   nitrogen     nitrogen\r\n    used.     centi-    indigo,   centimeter of   values,   values for a\r\n              meters.    cubic    indigo, gram.    gram.     difference\r\n                         centi-                             of one cubic\r\n                        meters.                             centi- meter\r\n                                                               in the\r\n                                                             amount of\r\n                                                              indigo,\r\n                                                               gram.\r\n ⁸⁄₆₄ Normal     10.00              0.000035000\r\n ⁷⁄₆₄   „         8.71       1.29   0.000035161 0.000000161  0.000000125\r\n ⁶⁄₆₄   „         7.43       1.28   0.000035330 0.000000169  0.000000132\r\n ⁵⁄₆₄   „         6.14       1.29   0.000035627 0.000000298  0.000000231\r\n ⁴⁄₆₄   „         4.86       1.28   0.000036008 0.000000381  0.000000298\r\n ³⁄₆₄   „         3.57       1.29   0.000036763 0.000000756  0.000000586\r\n ²⁄₆₄   „         2.29       1.28   0.000038209 0.000001445  0.000001129\r\n ¹⁄₆₄   „         1.00       1.29   0.000043750 0.000005541  0.000004295\r\n\r\nThe table is used as follows:\r\n\r\nSuppose that twenty cubic centimeters of water under examination have\r\nrequired 5.36 cubic centimeters of indigo solution for the oxidation of\r\nthe nitric acid contained therein. By inspection of the table it is seen\r\nthat this number is five-tenths cubic centimeter above the nearest\r\nquantity given; _viz._, 4.86 cubic centimeters. From the last column in\r\nthe table it is found that the correction for five-tenths cubic\r\ncentimeter of indigo solution is 0.000000149 cubic centimeter, being\r\nhalf that for the one cubic centimeter given in the table. This is to be\r\nsubtracted from the unit value in nitrogen given in the first “gram”\r\ncolumn of the table; _viz._, 0.000036008. It is thus seen that the 5.86\r\ncubic centimeters of indigo solution are equivalent to 0.000035859 gram\r\nof nitrogen per cubic centimeter. The water under examination,\r\ntherefore, contains nine and six-tenths parts of nitrogen as nitric acid\r\nper million.\r\n\r\nAttention must also be paid in standardizing indigo solutions to the\r\ninitial temperature of the solutions. A rise in the initial temperature\r\nwill be attended by a diminution in the quantity of indigo oxidized.\r\nExperiments with a room temperature of 10° and a room temperature of\r\n20°, being the initial temperatures of the experiments, showed that at\r\nthe higher temperature the amount of indigo consumed was about five per\r\ncent less when the strong solutions of nitrate were employed. The indigo\r\nsolution should, therefore, be standardized at the same temperature at\r\nwhich the determinations are made.\r\n\r\nIf twenty cubic centimeters of the standard nitrate solution employed be\r\nused in setting the indigo solution, this standard will enable the\r\noperator to determine nitric acid up to 17.5 parts of nitrogen per\r\nmillion in water or soil extracts.\r\n\r\nThe presence of an abundance of chlorids in the water under examination\r\ntends to diminish the content of nitric acid found, and also tends to\r\nintroduce an error, which is sometimes of a plus and sometimes of a\r\nminus quantity, according to the strength of the nitric acid present.\r\nThe reaction is shortened in weak solutions by the presence of chlorids,\r\nand the quantity of indigo consumed is consequently increased. The error\r\nintroduced by chlorids is usually of an insignificant nature.\r\n\r\nOn account of the interference of organic matters with the reaction of\r\nindigo it is not of much use in the examination of nitrates washed out\r\nof soils, although in some cases the results may be quite accurate. This\r\nmethod must, therefore, be considered as applicable, in general, to\r\nwaters or soil extracts which contain little or no organic matter.\r\n\r\nIn analytical work pertaining particularly to agriculture, the use of\r\nthe indigo method for determining nitric acid has been largely employed,\r\nboth in the analyses of soil extracts and drainage and irrigation\r\nwaters. The method, however, can hardly survive as an important one in\r\nsuch work in competition with more modern and speedy processes of\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n       DETERMINATION OF NITRIC NITROGEN BY REDUCTION TO AMMONIA.\r\n\r\n=480. Classification of Methods.=—When nitrogen is present in a highly\r\noxidized state, _e. g._, as nitric acid, it may be quickly and\r\naccurately estimated by reduction to ammonia. This action is effected by\r\nthe reducing power of nascent hydrogen, and this substance may be\r\nsecured in the active state by the action of an acid or alkali on a\r\nmetal, or by means of an electric current. The processes depending on\r\nthe use of a finely divided metal in the presence of an acid or alkali\r\nhave come into general use within a few years, and are now employed\r\ngenerally instead of the more elaborate estimations depending on the use\r\nof copper oxid or indigo.\r\n\r\nThe typical reaction which takes place in all cases is represented by\r\nthe following equation:\r\n\r\n                       2HNO₃ + 8H₂ = 2NH₃ + 6H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe method will be considered under three heads; _viz._, 1. Reduction in\r\nan alkaline solution; 2. Reduction in an acid solution; 3. Reduction by\r\nmeans of an electric current.\r\n\r\nIn the first class of processes the reduction and distillation may go on\r\ntogether. In the second class the reduction is accomplished first and\r\nthe distillation effected afterwards, with the addition of an alkali. In\r\nthe third class of operations the reduction is accomplished by means of\r\nan electric current and the ammonia subsequently obtained by\r\ndistillation, or determined by nesslerizing. These processes may be\r\napplied to rain and drainage waters, and to soil extracts. On account of\r\nthe ease with which the analyses are accomplished, the short time\r\nrequired and the accuracy of the results, the reduction methods for\r\nnitrates have already commended themselves to analysts, and are quite\r\nlikely to supersede all others for practical use where weighable\r\nquantities of nitrates are present. For the minute traces of nitrates\r\nfound in rain and drainage waters, and in some soil extracts, the\r\nreduction method may also be applied, but in these cases the ammonia\r\nwhich is formed must be determined by colorimetry (nesslerizing) and not\r\nby distillation. The processes about to be described are especially\r\napplicable to the examination of soils and waters rich in nitrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    REDUCTION IN ALKALINE SOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n=481. Provisional Method of the Association of Official Agricultural\r\nChemists.=[308]—\r\n\r\n_Extraction of the Nitrates._—Place one kilogram of the dried soil,\r\ncalculated to water-free substance, on a percolator of glass or tin.\r\nMoisten the soil thoroughly with pure distilled water, and allow to\r\nstand for half an hour. Add fresh portions of pure distilled water until\r\nthe filtrate secured amounts to one liter. If the first filtrate be\r\ncloudy before use it may be refiltered.\r\n\r\n_Qualitative Test for Nitrates._—Evaporate five cubic centimeters of the\r\nsoil extract in a porcelain crucible, having first dissolved a small\r\nquantity of pure brucin sulfate therein. When dry, add to the residue a\r\ndrop of concentrated sulfuric acid free of nitrates. If the nitrate\r\ncalculated as potassium nitrate does not exceed the two-thousandth part\r\nof a milligram only a pink color will be developed; with the\r\nthree-thousandth part of a milligram a pink color with reddish lines;\r\nwith the four-thousandth part of a milligram a reddish color; with the\r\nfive-thousandth part of a milligram a distinct red color.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of the Nitrates._—Evaporate 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\nsoil extract to dryness on a steam-bath. Dissolve the soluble portions\r\nof the residue in 100 cubic centimeters of ammonia-free distilled water,\r\nfiltering out any insoluble residue. Place the solution in a flask, add\r\nten cubic centimeters of sodium amalgam, stopper the flask with a valve\r\nwhich will permit the escape of hydrogen, and allow to stand in a cool\r\nroom for twenty-four hours. Add fifty cubic centimeters of milk of lime\r\nand titrate the ammonia produced by distillation, with standard acid and\r\nestimate as nitrogen pentoxid. Where the amount of ammonia is small,\r\nnesslerizing may be substituted for titration.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Sodium Amalgam._—Place 100 cubic centimeters of mercury\r\nin a flask of half a liter capacity; warm until paraffin will remain\r\nmelted over the surface; drop successively in the paraffin-covered\r\nmercury, pieces of metallic sodium of the size of a pea until 6.75 grams\r\nhave united with the mercury. The amalgam contains then 0.5 per cent of\r\nmetallic sodium and may be preserved indefinitely under the covering of\r\nparaffin.\r\n\r\n=482. Method of the Experiment Station at Möckern.=[309]—The principle\r\nof this reaction is based on the reducing action exercised by nascent\r\nhydrogen on a nitrate, the hydrogen being generated by the action of\r\nsoda-lye on a mixture of zinc dust and finely divided iron.\r\n\r\nTen grams of nitrate are dissolved in 500 cubic centimeters of water. Of\r\nthis solution twenty-five cubic centimeters, corresponding to one-half\r\ngram, are placed in a distillation flask of about 400 cubic centimeters\r\ncapacity, 120 cubic centimeters of water added, and about five grams of\r\nwell-washed and dried zinc dust and an equal weight of reduced iron. To\r\nthe solution are added eighty cubic centimeters of soda-lye of 32° B.\r\nThe flask is then connected with the condensing apparatus and the\r\ndistillation carried on synchronously with the reduction, the ammonia\r\nbeing collected in twenty cubic centimeters of titrated sulfuric acid.\r\nThe distillation is continued from one to two hours, or until 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters have been distilled, and the remaining sulfuric acid is\r\ntitrated in the usual way. Soil extracts and sewage waters should be\r\nconcentrated until they have approximately the proportion of nitrates\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\n=483. Method of Devarda.=—The inconvenience due to slow action and other\r\ncauses, arising from the use of pure metals in the reduction of nitrates\r\nto ammonia, has been overcome, to some extent, by Devarda, by use of an\r\nalloy, in a state of fine powder, consisting of aluminum, copper, and\r\nzinc.[310] The alloy consists of forty-five per cent of aluminum, fifty\r\nper cent of copper, and five per cent of zinc. In dissolving, the copper\r\nis left in a finely divided state, which is a great help in distillation\r\nin preventing bumping.\r\n\r\nThe analytical process is carried out as follows: The solution\r\ncontaining the nitrate, in quantity equivalent to about one-half gram of\r\npotassium nitrate, is placed in a flask having a capacity of about one\r\nliter, and diluted with sixty cubic centimeters of water and five cubic\r\ncentimeters of alcohol, and then forty cubic centimeters of caustic\r\npotash solution added of specific gravity one and three-tenths. From two\r\nto two and one-half grams of the alloy, described above, are introduced,\r\nand the flask attached to a condenser with a receiver containing\r\nstandard acid. The connection between the flask and the condenser is\r\nmade by means of a tube having on the limb next the flask a bulb filled\r\nwith glass beads to prevent the contents of the flask splashing over\r\ninto the receiver, and on the other limb another bulb to prevent the\r\nacid in the receiver finding its way into the distillation flask, should\r\nregurgitation occur. When the flask has been thus connected with the\r\ncondenser it is gently heated for half an hour, at the end of which time\r\nthe evolution of hydrogen will have slackened or ceased, and then the\r\ndistillation is begun, at first cautiously, until the zinc of the alloy\r\nhas completely dissolved, and then more vigorously, the time necessary\r\nbeing about twenty minutes from the time when the contents of the flask\r\nbegin to boil. The distillate is caught in standard acid and the ammonia\r\ndetermined by backward titration in the ordinary way. It is to be noted\r\nthat the strength of the alkali used is of importance, as if it be too\r\nstrong, the action on the alloy is unduly vigorous at the beginning of\r\nthe operation, and if too weak, the contents of the flask have to be\r\nheated overmuch, the result in both cases being the formation of a fine\r\nspray of caustic solution, which is very difficult to stop, even with\r\ncomplicated washing attachments to the distilling flask. The test\r\nanalyses on pure nitrates are satisfactory. This method has been used\r\nwith satisfaction in the laboratory of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nbut does not appear to have any special advantage over the process of\r\nUlsch, to be described further on.\r\n\r\n=484. Variation of Stoklassa.=—Stoklassa has subjected the method of\r\nDevarda to a comparative test with the following methods:[311]\r\n\r\n1. Wagner’s Schloesing-Grandeau method.\r\n\r\n2. Lunge’s nitrometer method.\r\n\r\n3. Stutzer’s method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 85. STOKLASSA’S NITRIC ACID APPARATUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe reduction takes place in a copper erlenmeyer, A, Fig. 85, in which,\r\nin addition to the solution containing the nitrate, are placed 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, forty cubic centimeters of potassium hydroxid\r\nsolution of 33° B., five cubic centimeters of alcohol, and finally two\r\nand one-half grams of the finely powdered Devarda alloy. The distillate\r\npasses through a tube, B, filled with glass pearls and into the\r\ncondenser D, through the bulbs, C C′.\r\n\r\nAfter the flask is connected with the distilling apparatus, it is gently\r\nwarmed and the reduction is ended in about twenty minutes. The ammonia\r\nwhich is formed is then distilled into E, containing the standard acid,\r\nS, requiring about twenty minutes more. The comparative results given,\r\nshow that the Devarda method is equally as accurate as any of the other\r\nmethods mentioned, giving practically theoretical results.\r\n\r\nIn so far, however, as speed of an analysis, is concerned the first\r\nplace is awarded to the Lunge nitrometer method, with which a complete\r\nanalysis can be made in from thirty to forty minutes. In the second\r\nrank, so far as speed is concerned, the Devarda method is recommended.\r\nAll the methods give accurate results.\r\n\r\n=485. Method of Sievert.=[312]—Two grams of potassium or sodium nitrate\r\nare dissolved and made up to 1,000 cubic centimeters. Fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the solution are placed in a 600 cubic centimeter flask\r\nand diluted with fifty cubic centimeters of water, and from eighteen to\r\ntwenty grams of caustic alkali added. After the alkali is dissolved,\r\nseventy-five cubic centimeters of ninety-six per cent alcohol are added\r\nand a few pieces of bone-black to prevent foaming. From ten to fifteen\r\ngrams of zinc or iron dust are then added to the flask which is closed\r\nand connected with a =ᥩ= tube holding about 200 cubic centimeters, which\r\ncontains about ten cubic centimeters of normal sulfuric acid. This =ᥩ=\r\ntube is kept cool by being immersed in water. The whole mixture is now\r\nallowed to stand for three or four hours and then the alcohol is\r\ndistilled slowly and the ammonia formed by the reduction of the nitrates\r\nis carried over with it. The distillation lasts for about two hours. The\r\ncontents of the =ᥩ= tube are carefully rinsed into a dish and the excess\r\nof sulfuric acid titrated with one-fourth normal soda-lye.\r\n\r\nFor soil extracts and substances containing unknown quantities of nitric\r\nacid, a preliminary test will indicate approximately the amount thereof,\r\nand this will be an indication for the quantity to be used in the\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nThe method of Stutzer differs from the foregoing in the substitution of\r\naluminum dust instead of iron or zinc.[313] The reducing power of\r\naluminum, however, varies greatly according to the method in which the\r\nmetal has been prepared. Pure aluminum prepared by the electric method,\r\nreduces the nitric acid much less vigorously than the metal prepared by\r\nthe older methods of fusion with sodium. For this reason the method of\r\nStutzer is not to be preferred to that of Sievert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     REDUCTION IN AN ACID SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n=486. Variation of the Sodium Amalgam Process.=—This method is described\r\nby Monnier and Auriol.[314]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 86. VARIATION OF THE SODIUM AMALGAM PROCESS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the operation depends on the reduction of the dissolved\r\nnitrate by titrated sodium amalgam in presence of an acid, and the\r\nestimation of the quantity of nitric acid present from the deficit in\r\nthe volume of hydrogen. The apparatus employed is conveniently mounted\r\nas shown in Fig. 86. The brass vessel A is movable by means of the cord\r\non the pulley B, in such a way as to be fixed at any required altitude.\r\nIt is filled with water and connected by a rubber tube to the cooling\r\ntube D. Within the cooling tube there is a graduated cylinder open at\r\nits lower end. Its upper end is connected directly with the apparatus C.\r\nThe cooling tube D has a small side tube, _c_, near its upper end, by\r\nmeans of which the air can enter or escape when the position of A is\r\nchanged. The apparatus C, in which the reaction takes place, is a glass\r\ncylinder. Its upper end is continuous with the =⟙= tube provided with\r\nthe stop-cocks _a_ and _b_. One arm of the =⟙= permits connection with\r\nthe graduated measuring tube by means of a rubber union. The lower end\r\nof C is closed with a large hollow ground-glass stopper, carrying a\r\nsmall receptacle within, so that it forms two separate water-tight\r\ncompartments, open at the top.\r\n\r\nThe sodium amalgam is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nIn a clay crucible are heated 400 grams of mercury, and, little by\r\nlittle, with constant stirring, four grams of dry sodium are added. When\r\ncold, the amalgam is placed in a burette, having a ground-glass stopper,\r\nand covered with petroleum. The strength of the amalgam is established\r\nin the following manner. A small glass thimble, ground even at the top,\r\nis filled with the amalgam and struck off even with a ground-glass\r\nstraight edge. In this way the same quantity of amalgam is taken for\r\neach test. This measured portion of the amalgam is placed in the inner\r\nvessel of the glass stopper to C. Ten cubic centimeters of water,\r\ncontaining sixty centigrams of tartaric acid, are placed on the outer\r\nring of the glass stopper, which is then inserted, well oiled, in C,\r\nclosing it air- and water-tight. The tartaric acid solution also carries\r\na piece of litmus paper, so that its constant acidity may be insured.\r\nThe vessel A is then fixed in a position which brings the water in the\r\ngraduated burette and tube D exactly to the 0 mark. The cock _a_ is next\r\nclosed, _b_ opened, and C is inverted until all the amalgam is poured\r\ninto the solution of tartaric acid. The evolved hydrogen mixed with the\r\nair contained in the apparatus, is passed into the graduated burette.\r\nAfter fifteen minutes, the reaction is ended. The water level within and\r\nwithout the graduated tube is restored and the volume of gas evolved\r\nnoted and reduced by the usual tables to 0° and 760 millimeters pressure\r\nof the barometer.\r\n\r\nAn amalgam prepared as above will give about three cubic centimeters of\r\nhydrogen for each gram. The thimble should hold from twelve to fifteen\r\ngrams.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of nitric acid should be made in a solution containing\r\nabout one-tenth per cent of nitrate. Ten cubic centimeters are taken, to\r\nwhich six-tenths gram of tartaric acid is added, and placed in the outer\r\npart of the glass stopper. The rest of the process is conducted exactly\r\nas described above. The deficit in hydrogen is calculated to nitrogen\r\npentoxid.\r\n\r\nThe reduction by sodium amalgam is not so convenient a form of\r\nestimating nitric acid as many of the other forms of using nascent\r\nhydrogen. As practiced by calculating from the deficit of hydrogen,\r\nhowever, it has some advantages by reason of the fact that no heating is\r\nrequired. The presence of organic neutral bodies, or even those of an\r\nacid nature, like humus, does not, therefore, interfere with the work.\r\nLikewise, mineral bodies in solution, which are not reduced by nascent\r\nhydrogen, do not interfere with the accuracy of the reaction.\r\n\r\n=487. Method of Schmitt.=—In the method of Schmitt forty cubic\r\ncentimeters of glacial acetic acid are placed in a flask of 600 cubic\r\ncentimeters content, and fifteen grams of a mixture of zinc and iron\r\ndust added.[315] To this a quantity of the solution containing the\r\nnitrate, representing about half a gram of the pure nitrate, is added\r\nwith constant shaking, in portions which do not evolve hydrogen too\r\nrapidly. After about fifteen minutes when the evolution of nitrogen has\r\nsomewhat diminished, an additional fifteen grams of the metal dust are\r\nadded. If the contents of the flask should become thick they can be\r\ndiluted with thirty cubic centimeters of water. The reduction is\r\ncomplete in from thirty to forty minutes. The contents of the flask are\r\nnow saturated with enough soda-lye not only to neutralize the excess of\r\nacetic acid, but to keep the zinc hydroxid also in solution. For this\r\npurpose about 200 cubic centimeters of soda-lye of 1.25 specific gravity\r\nare necessary. The ammonia is obtained by distillation into standard\r\nacid in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=488. Method of Ulsch.=—In practice the method of Ulsch has come into\r\ngeneral use.[316]\r\n\r\nFor the determination of nitrogen by this method half a gram of\r\nsaltpeter or four-tenths gram of sodium nitrate is taken and dissolved\r\nin twenty five cubic centimeters of water, in a flask with a content of\r\nabout 600 cubic centimeters. Five grams of iron reduced by hydrogen, and\r\nten cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid diluted with two volumes of water\r\nare then added to the flask. To avoid mechanical losses during the\r\nevolution of hydrogen a pear-shaped glass stopper is hung in the neck of\r\nthe flask. After the first violent evolution of hydrogen has passed, the\r\nflask is slowly heated until in about four minutes it is brought to a\r\ngentle boil. The boiling is continued for about six minutes when the\r\nreduction is complete. About fifty cubic centimeters of water are then\r\nadded; also an excess of soda-lye and a few particles of zinc and the\r\nammonia is distilled and collected in standard acid in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe method of Ulsch can also be applied, according to Fricke, to the\r\nanalysis of nitrates contained in drinking and drainage waters, and it\r\nis regarded by him as one of the best methods to be employed in such\r\ninvestigations.[317]\r\n\r\nThe method of Ulsch in this laboratory has given entirely satisfactory\r\nresults, and is generally used in preference to other methods in cases\r\nwhere a considerable quantity of nitrates is present. It is based on the\r\nfollowing reactions:\r\n\r\n                     2KNO₃ + H₂SO₄ = K₂SO₄ + 2HNO₃\r\n                     2HNO₃ + 8H₂ = 2NH₃ + 6H₂O\r\n                     2NH₃ + H₂SO₄ = (NH₄)₂SO₄.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   REDUCTION BY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT.\r\n\r\n=489. Method of Williams-Warington.=—From the losses which naturally\r\noccur during the evaporation of water, even with all the precautions\r\nnoted, Warington was led to try some method for the determination of\r\nnitrates and nitrites in waters without previous concentration.[318] The\r\nreduction of these bodies by the copper-zinc couple formed the basis of\r\nthese experiments, and they resulted in the following method of\r\nmanipulation, which is based on a process devised by Williams.[319]\r\n\r\nThe method consists in boiling rapidly one liter of the rain water in a\r\nretort, with a little magnesia previously raised to a low red heat and\r\nthen washed, until 250 cubic centimeters have distilled over. The\r\nresidue is then made up to 800 cubic centimeters, transferred to a\r\nwide-mouthed, stoppered bottle supplied with strips of copper and zinc\r\nforming electric couples, and set aside, at a constant temperature of\r\nfrom 21°–24°, for three days. A measured portion of the solution is then\r\ndistilled, and the ammonia determined in the distillate by nesslerizing.\r\n\r\nThis plan has two advantages: First, the ammonia, as well as the\r\nnitrogen as nitrates and nitrites, can be determined in the course of\r\nthe same operation and in the same sample of water. For this purpose it\r\nis only necessary to fit the retort to an efficient condenser and to\r\nremove all ammonia from the apparatus by boiling distilled water in the\r\nretort before introducing the rain water. The distillate of 250 cubic\r\ncentimeters from the rain water, as described above, is well mixed and\r\nthe ammonia determined, in from twenty-five to one hundred cubic\r\ncentimeters thereof, diluted to 150 cubic centimeters with ammonia-free\r\nwater. Second, the nitrogen, as nitrates and nitrites, is determined\r\ndirectly and alone; the error of the determination is as small as\r\nnesslerizing admits of, since it is possible, if necessary, to distill\r\n600 cubic centimeters of the boiled rain water corresponding to 750\r\ncubic centimeters of the original, and thus obtain a full amount of\r\nammonia for determination, even when the rain water has been poor in\r\nnitrates.\r\n\r\nThe determination of nitric nitrogen, in a given sample, by the above\r\nmethod gave a mean quantity of product of 0.162 part per million, while\r\nthe determination, in the same lot of samples, by the modified\r\nSchloesing method gave 0.125 part per million. This result confirms the\r\nsupposition that in the complete evaporation necessary to the\r\nmanipulation of the Schloesing method there is a loss of nitrogen. The\r\namount of nitrogen as nitrates and nitrites in the rain water at\r\nRothamstead, for the twelve months ending April 1, 1888, was found, by\r\nthe Schloesing method, to be 0.614 pound per acre, the total rain-fall\r\nbeing 21.96 inches. For the year ending April 1, 1889, by the\r\ncopper-zinc method, it amounted to 0.917 pound per acre, the total\r\nrain-fall being 29.27 inches.\r\n\r\nThe amounts found in other localities are quite different from the\r\nabove, as for instance, the mean of seven stations in Germany for\r\nthirteen years, beginning in 1864, showed 10.18 pounds of nitrogen per\r\nacre. The average amount for ten years at the observatory of Mont\r\nSauris, near Paris, showed 12.36 pounds of nitrogen per acre. The\r\naverage for three years at Lincoln, as determined by Professor G. Gray,\r\nshows one and six-tenths pounds of nitrogen per acre per annum. At\r\nTokio, in Japan, Kellner found, for one year, 1.02 pounds per acre.\r\n\r\n=490. Determination of the Ammonia.=—The method used at Rothamstead is\r\nto make one determination of ammonia in the whole of the distillate\r\nobtained, the strength of which is regulated by varying the amount\r\nintroduced into the retort, so that it shall be equal to about two cubic\r\ncentimeters of the standard ammonia solution. A 150 cubic centimeter\r\ncylinder is first filled with the rain water, and fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of nessler reagent added. The depth of tint indicates what\r\nquantity of rain water will be required for distillation. This having\r\nbeen determined, the appropriate volume of the rain water, provided it\r\ndo not exceed 600 cubic centimeters, is placed in the retort described\r\nabove, and the distillation continued until the 150 cubic centimeter\r\ncylinder is filled. The titration is made in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=491. Preparation of the Copper-Zinc Couple.=—For 800 cubic centimeters\r\nof boiled rain water, prepared as described, six strips of zinc foil,\r\nfour inches long by one and a quarter inches wide, are taken and bent at\r\nright angles along their center to obtain stiffness. The couple is\r\ncleansed and coated by washing in a series of five beakers containing,\r\nrespectively, dilute solution of sodium hydroxid, very dilute sulfuric\r\nacid, a three per cent solution of copper sulfate, ordinary distilled\r\nwater, and distilled water free from ammonia. Through these five beakers\r\nthe zinc foil is successively passed. It is rinsed both after the alkali\r\nand the acid. But after the copper has been deposited, the strips are\r\nsimply drained and carefully placed in the distilled water, it being\r\ndifficult to rinse without removing the copper. The couples should be\r\nentirely submerged when placed in the rain water. The strips should\r\nremain in the copper sulfate solution long enough to be well covered\r\nwith copper.\r\n\r\n=492. Substitution of an Aluminum-Mercury Couple for\r\nCopper-Zinc.=—Ormandy and Cohen have proposed to use an aluminum-mercury\r\ncouple for the copper-zinc in the process described above.[320]\r\n\r\nThis couple acts more quickly than the copper-zinc, and the results are\r\nequally as accurate. Nitrites are reduced in about one hour by this\r\napparatus, while the zinc-copper couple of Gladstone and Tribe requires\r\nabout six times as long. Aluminum foil, free of grease, should be used.\r\nThe foil should be heated over a bunsen just before amalgamation. The\r\nclean, very thin foil is coated with mercury by shaking with a\r\nconcentrated solution of mercuric chlorid. It should be prepared\r\nimmediately before use.\r\n\r\nThe amalgamated foil is introduced into the sample of water to be\r\nanalyzed, and left until all the aluminum is converted into oxid. The\r\npresence of the oxid favors the prevention of bumping during the\r\nsubsequent distillation. The distilled ammonia, collected in dilute\r\nacid, is determined by nesslerizing, the free ammonia in the sample\r\nhaving been previously determined. The increase in ammonia is due to\r\nnitrates or nitrites reduced by the couple.\r\n\r\n\r\n           IODOMETRIC ESTIMATION OF NITRIC ACID IN NITRATES.\r\n\r\n=493. Method of De Koninck and Nihoul.=—This process is applicable only\r\nin the absence of organic bodies and other reducing agents.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which it rests, as applied by McGowan, is as\r\nfollows:[321]\r\n\r\nWhen a fairly concentrated solution of a nitrate is warmed with an\r\nexcess of pure, strong hydrochloric acid, the nitrate is completely\r\ndecomposed, and the production of nitrosyl chlorid and chlorin is\r\nquantitative. The reaction, as shown by Tilden, is represented by the\r\nfollowing equation:[322]\r\n\r\n                    HNO₃ + 3HCl = NOCl + Cl₂ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\nOne molecule of nitric acid thus yields two atoms of chlorin and one\r\nmolecule of nitrosyl chlorid capable of setting free three atoms of\r\niodin. The iodin can be estimated in the usual manner by titration with\r\nsodium thiosulfate. The nitrosyl chlorid is decomposed by the potassium\r\niodid, nitric oxid escaping.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus employed is shown in Fig. 87.\r\n\r\nA is a small, round-bottomed flask, into the neck of which a glass\r\nstopper, _x_, is accurately ground (with fine emery and oil). The\r\ncapacity of the bulb is about forty-six cubic centimeters, and the\r\nlength of the neck, from _x_ to _y_, ninety millimeters. The first\r\ncondenser is a simple tube, slightly enlarged at the foot into two small\r\nbulbs.[323] The length from _a_ to _b_ is 300 millimeters, from _b_ to\r\n_c_ 180 millimeters, and from _e_ to _f_ thirty millimeters. The\r\ncapacity of the bulb B is twenty-five cubic centimeters, and the total\r\ncapacity of the two bulbs and tube, up to the top of C, forty-one cubic\r\ncentimeters. This condenser is immersed, up to the level of _c_, in a\r\nbeaker full of water. D is a geissler bulb apparatus, E is a calcium\r\nchlorid tube, filled with broken glass, which acts as a tower and _g_ is\r\na small funnel, attached by rubber and clip to the branch =⟙= tube _h_.\r\nBetween the =⟙= tube _i_ and the wash-bottle for the carbon dioxid is\r\nplaced a short piece of glass tubing, _s_, containing a strip of filter\r\npaper, slightly moistened with iodid of starch solution. This tube _s_\r\nis really hardly necessary, as no chlorin escapes backwards if a\r\nmoderate current of carbon dioxid is kept passing, but it serves as a\r\ncheck. A glance at the joints _o_, _p_, and _q_, which are of narrow\r\nindia-rubber tubing, is sufficient to show that, by using this\r\narrangement, practically no rubber is exposed to the action of the\r\nchlorin. The tiny piece of rubber tubing at the joint _o_ may be done\r\naway with, the narrower tube there being accurately ground into the\r\nwider one; this makes the condensing apparatus practically perfect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 87. MCGOWAN’S APPARATUS FOR THE IODOMETRIC ESTIMATION OF NITRIC\r\n    ACID.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe actual operation is performed in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThe evolution flask is washed and thoroughly dried, and the nitrate\r\n(say, about 0.25 gram of potassium nitrate) is tapped into it from the\r\nweighing tube. Two cubic centimeters of water are now added, and the\r\nbulb is gently warmed, so as to bring the nitrate into solution, after\r\nwhich the stopper of the flask is firmly inserted. About fifteen cubic\r\ncentimeters of a solution of potassium iodid (one in four) are run into\r\nthe first condensing tube, any iodid adhering to the upper portion of\r\nthe tube being washed down with a little water, and five cubic\r\ncentimeters of the same solution, mixed with eight to ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, are sucked into the geissler bulbs whilst the\r\nglass in the tower E is also thoroughly moistened with the iodid. The\r\ngeissler bulbs should be so arranged that gas only bubbles through the\r\nlast of them, the liquid in the others remaining quiescent.\r\n\r\nAll the joints having been made tight the carbon dioxid is turned on\r\nbriskly and passed through the apparatus until a small tubeful collected\r\nat _l_, over caustic potash solution, shows that no appreciable amount\r\nof air is left in it. The small outlet tube _l_, is now replaced by a\r\ncalcium chlorid tube, filled with broken glass which has been moistened\r\nwith the above-mentioned iodid solution, and closed by a cork through\r\nwhich an outlet tube passes, the object of this trap tube being to\r\nprevent any air getting back into the apparatus. The brisk current of\r\ncarbon dioxid is continued for a minute or two longer, so as to\r\npractically expel all the air from this last tube. The stream of gas is\r\nnow stopped for an instant, and about fifteen cubic centimeters of pure\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid, free from chlorin, run into A through\r\nthe funnel _g_ (into the tube of which it is well to have run a few\r\ndrops of water before beginning to expel the air from the apparatus),\r\nand A is shaken so as to mix its contents thoroughly. A slow current of\r\ncarbon dioxid is now again turned on (one to two bubbles through the\r\nwash-bottle per second), and A is gently warmed over a burner. It is a\r\ndistinct advantage that the reaction does not begin until the mixed\r\nsolutions are warmed, when the liquid becomes orange-colored, the color\r\nagain disappearing after the nitrosyl chlorid and chlorin have been\r\nexpelled. The warming should be very gentle at first in order to make\r\nsure of the conversion of all the nitric acid, and also because the\r\nfirst escaping vapors are relatively very rich in chlorin; afterwards\r\nthe liquid in A is briskly boiled. A very little practice enables the\r\noperator to judge as to the proper rate of warming. When the volume of\r\nliquid in A has been reduced to about seven cubic centimeters (by which\r\ntime it is again colorless) the stream of carbon dioxid is slightly\r\nquickened and the apparatus allowed to cool a little. The burner is now\r\nset aside for a few minutes, and two cubic centimeters more of\r\nhydrochloric acid, previously warmed in a test-tube, run in gently\r\nthrough _g_; there is no fear either of the iodid solution running back,\r\nor of any bubbles of air escaping through _y_ if this is done carefully.\r\nThis is a precautionary measure, in case a trace of the liberated\r\nchlorin might have lodged in the comparatively cool liquid in the tube\r\n_h_. The carbon dioxid is once more turned on slowly and the liquid in A\r\nis boiled again until it is reduced to about five cubic centimeters. It\r\nis now only necessary to allow the apparatus to cool, passing carbon\r\ndioxid all the time, after which the contents of the condensers are\r\ntransferred to a flask and titrated with thiosulfate. At the end of a\r\nproperly conducted experiment, the glass in the upper part of tower E\r\nshould be quite colorless and there should be only a mere trace of iodin\r\nshowing in the lower part of the tower, while the liquid in the last\r\nbulb of the geissler apparatus ought to be pale yellow. During the\r\noperation, the stopper of A and the various joints can be tested from\r\ntime to time by means of a piece of iodid of starch paper, and before\r\ndisjointing it is well to test the escaping gas (say at _m_) in the same\r\nway, to make sure that all nitric oxid has been thoroughly expelled.\r\n\r\nThe method is capable of giving accurate results, but it can not be\r\npreferred to the reduction or colorimetric processes.\r\n\r\n=494. Method of Gooch and Gruener.=—The principle on which this method\r\nrests depends on the decomposition of a nitrate in presence of a hot\r\nsaturated solution of manganous chlorid and hydrochloric acid in an\r\natmosphere of carbon dioxid.[324] The products of decomposition are\r\npassed into a solution of potassium iodid and the liberated iodin is\r\ntitrated with standard sodium thiosulfate. The products of the reaction\r\nare chlorin, nitric oxid, and possibly nitrosyl chlorid, and under\r\nproper precautions the iodin set free is quantitively proportional to\r\nthe weight of nitrate decomposed. The manganous mixture is acted on\r\nslowly at ordinary temperatures, but on heating, the nitrate is\r\ndecomposed with the formation of a higher manganese chlorid and nitric\r\noxid. When the heat is continued a sufficient length of time the chlorin\r\nfrom the higher chlorids is evolved and only manganous chlorid remains.\r\nDuring the heating the color of the solution passes from green to black\r\nand at the end the green color is restored. The apparatus employed is\r\nshown in Fig. 88.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 88. APPARATUS OF GOOCH AND GRUENER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA plain pipette bent as is shown in the figure serves as the generating\r\nflask and for the attachment on the one hand to the carbon dioxid\r\napparatus and on the other to the system of absorption bulbs for\r\ncontaining the potassium iodid. The latter should be glass, sealed to\r\nthe evolution bulb of the pipette to prevent the action of the evolved\r\ngases on organic materials. The point of the potassium iodid apparatus\r\nis drawn out so as to be pushed well into the second receiver, being\r\nheld in place by a piece of rubber tubing. The third tube acts simply as\r\na trap to exclude the air from the absorption apparatus. The first\r\nreceiver contains in solution three grams, the second two, and the third\r\none gram of potassium iodid. During the reaction the first receiver is\r\nkept cool by immersion in water. Before connecting the apparatus with\r\nthe carbon dioxid generator the solution of manganous chlorid and\r\nafterwards the nitrate solution are drawn into the bulb of the pipette\r\nby gentle suction. After connecting the apparatus the current of carbon\r\ndioxid is started and kept up until all the air is expelled. Heat is\r\nthen applied to the bulb of the pipette and the distillation continued\r\nuntil all the liquid has passed over. At the end of the reaction the\r\ncontents of the receivers are united by disconnecting the apparatus from\r\nthe carbon dioxid generator and passing water through the pipette. The\r\nintroduction of the manganous chlorid into the mixture does not\r\ninterfere with the titration of the iodin. This is accomplished in the\r\nusual way with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator. The\r\nquantity of material used should contain about the amount of nitric acid\r\nthat is found in two-tenths of a gram of potassium nitrate. This method,\r\nso similar to the preceding, is somewhat less complex, and, to that\r\nextent, preferable to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n         ESTIMATION OF NITRIC ACID BY COLORIMETRIC COMPARISON.\r\n\r\n=495. Delicacy of the Method.=—The remarkable delicacy of those methods\r\nof chemical analysis, which depend on the production of a pronounced\r\ncolor, which can be compared with that produced by a known quantity of a\r\ngiven substance, has been long illustrated by the nesslerizing process\r\nfor the estimation of ammonia. By such methods minute qualities of\r\nsubstances can be quantitively determined with great accuracy, when they\r\nwould escape all effort for their estimation by gravimetric methods.\r\nProcesses based on this principle are, therefore, peculiarly applicable\r\nto the detection and estimation of oxidized nitrogen in waters and soil\r\nextracts, whether they be present as nitric, nitrous, or ammoniacal\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nIn the following paragraphs will be given with sufficient detail for the\r\nneeds of the analyst, the principles and practice of the colorimetric\r\ncomparison methods which have been approved as best by the experience of\r\nanalysts. These methods are applicable especially to cases in which only\r\nminute quantities of the substances looked for are present, and where\r\ncelerity of determination is especially desirable. They are, therefore,\r\nof especial value in the analysis of rain, drainage, and irrigation\r\nwaters, and of soil extracts poor in oxidized nitrogen.\r\n\r\n=496. Hooker’s Method.=—The quantitive action depends upon the deep\r\ngreen coloration given by nitric acid, when dissolved in sulfuric acid\r\nand carbazol.[325] Other oxidizing bodies, such as iron, chlorin,\r\nbromin, chromic acid, etc., give the same reaction, but not in such a\r\nprominent manner. Such bodies with the exception of chlorin and iron,\r\nare not often found in waters. In the application of the process, iron,\r\nif present in quantities greater than one-tenth part per one hundred\r\nthousand, must be removed. Chlorids also, even when present in very\r\nsmall quantities, interfere with the delicacy of the reaction and must\r\nbe removed. Easily destructible organic matter tends to lower the\r\nresult, but not materially, unless present in large excess. Calcium\r\ncarbonate and sulfate, soda, and other alkalies, in the quantities in\r\nwhich they are usually present in water, do not affect the result. The\r\nfollowing reagents are required:\r\n\r\n  1. Concentrated sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n  2. An acetic acid solution of carbazol; diphenylimid, (C₆H₄\\/C₆H₄/\r\n       NH.)\r\n\r\n  3. A sulfuric acid solution of carbazol.\r\n\r\n  4. Standard solutions of potassium nitrate.\r\n\r\n  5. A solution of aluminum sulfate.\r\n\r\n  6. A solution of silver sulfate.\r\n\r\n1. The sulfuric acid, used for all purposes in the process, should be\r\nentirely free from nitrogen oxids. It may be readily tested by\r\ndissolving in it a small quantity of carbazol. If the solution be at\r\nfirst golden-yellow or brown, the acid is sufficiently pure; if it be\r\ngreen or greenish, another and better sample must be taken. It is\r\nessential also that the specific gravity of the acid be fully 1.84, and\r\nit is well to ascertain that this is really the case.\r\n\r\n2. The acetic acid solution of carbazol is prepared by dissolving\r\nsix-tenths gram in about ninety cubic centimeters of strongest acetic\r\nacid, by the aid of gentle heat. It is allowed to cool, and is then made\r\nup to 100 cubic centimeters by the further addition of acetic acid. The\r\nexact strength of this solution, is of no material importance to the\r\nsuccess of the process, and the above proportions have been selected\r\nprincipally because they are convenient. The solution will remain\r\nunchanged for several months. The use of this solution merely\r\nfacilitates the preparation of that next described, which will not keep,\r\nand has, consequently, to be freshly prepared for each series of\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\n3. The sulfuric acid solution of carbazol is easily made in a few\r\nseconds, but it is advisable to allow it to stand from one and one-half\r\nto two hours before using. It is prepared by rapidly adding fifteen\r\ncubic centimeters of sulfuric acid, to one cubic centimeter of the\r\nabove-described acetic acid solution. This quantity usually suffices for\r\nfrom two to three nitrate estimations. When freshly prepared it is\r\ngolden-yellow or brown; it changes gradually, however, and in the course\r\nof one and one-half or two hours it becomes olive-green. This change is\r\nprobably due to traces of oxidizing agents, which occur in the sulfuric\r\nand acetic acids, and which, although not present in sufficient quantity\r\nto act immediately, gradually bring about the reaction described. The\r\ngreenish color does not interfere with the process, as might at first be\r\nsupposed; on the contrary, the solution is not sensitive to small\r\nquantities of nitric acid until it has undergone the change to\r\nolive-green, and it is for this reason, that it should be prepared about\r\ntwo hours before required for use. This solution may be thoroughly\r\ndepended on for six hours after preparation. The intensities of color\r\nproduced by the more concentrated solutions of nitrates after this time,\r\ngradually approach each other and become ultimately the same.\r\n\r\n4. The standard solutions of potassium nitrate are very readily\r\nprepared. The solutions which are to be compared directly with the\r\nwaters examined, may be prepared as required, but if many determinations\r\nare to be made with a variety of waters, it will be found best to\r\nprepare a complete series, differing from each other by 0.02 part\r\nnitrogen in 100,000. This series may include solutions containing\r\nquantities of nitrogen in 100,000 parts, represented by all the odd\r\nnumbers from 0.03 up to 0.39. It will be found convenient to prepare\r\nthem in quantities of 100 cubic centimeters at a time, from a stock\r\nsolution of potassium nitrate which contains 0.00001 gram nitrogen, or\r\n0.000045 nitric acid in one cubic centimeter. Each cubic centimeter of\r\nthis solution, when diluted to 100 cubic centimeters, represents 0.01\r\nnitrogen in 100,000, and consequently if it is desired to make a\r\nsolution containing 0.35 part nitrogen in 100,000, thirty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters are taken and made up to 100 cubic centimeters, and so on.\r\nThe solution of potassium nitrate (b) is best prepared from a stronger\r\none (a) containing 0.0001 gram nitrogen to the cubic centimeter, or\r\n0.7214 gram potassium nitrate to the liter; 100 cubic centimeters of (a)\r\nmade up to one liter give the solution (b). It is obvious that the\r\nseries of solutions, above described, could be made directly from (a),\r\nbut by first making (b), greater accuracy is secured.\r\n\r\n5. For purposes which will be presently described, a solution of\r\naluminum sulfate is required, containing five grams to the liter. The\r\nsalt used must be free from chlorin and iron; and the solution should\r\ngive no reaction when tested with carbazol.\r\n\r\n6. The solution of silver sulfate is required for the removal of chlorin\r\nfrom the water or soil extract to be examined. It is prepared by\r\ndissolving 4.3943 grams of the salt in pure distilled water and making\r\nup to one liter. The sulfate is preferably obtained by dissolving\r\nmetallic silver in pure sulfuric acid. The solution should be tested\r\nwith carbazol in the same way as will be presently described for water;\r\nif perfectly pure, no reaction will be obtained. As silver sulfate is\r\noften prepared by precipitation from the nitrate, it is very apt to\r\ncontain nitric acid, and consequently, if the source of the salt be\r\nunknown, this test should on no account be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe analytical process is carried on as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo cubic centimeters of the water are carefully delivered by means of a\r\npipette into the bottom of a test-tube; four cubic centimeters of\r\nsulfuric acid are added, and the solution thoroughly mixed by the help\r\nof a glass rod. The test-tube is then immersed in cold water, and when\r\nwell cooled, one cubic centimeter of the sulfuric acid solution of\r\ncarbazol is added, and the whole again mixed as before. The intensity of\r\nthe color is now observed, and a little experience enables a fairly good\r\nopinion to be formed of the quantity of nitric acid present. Suppose\r\nthat the water be roughly estimated to contain about 0.15 part nitrogen\r\nper 100,000; in such a case solutions of potassium nitrate containing\r\n0.11, 0.15, 0.19 part nitrogen are selected from the series. Two cubic\r\ncentimeters are taken from each, and treated, side by side, with a fresh\r\nquantity of the water, precisely as described for the preliminary\r\nexperiment, the various operations being performed as nearly\r\nsimultaneously as possible with each of the samples, and under precisely\r\nsimilar conditions. Two or three minutes after the carbazol has been\r\nadded, the intensity of the color of each is observed. If that given by\r\nthe water is matched by any of the standard solutions, the estimation is\r\nat an end. Similarly, if it falls between two of these, the mean may be\r\ntaken as representing the nitrogen present in cases in which great\r\naccuracy is not required. If this be done, the maximum error will be\r\n0.02 part nitrogen, or 0.09 part nitric acid per 100,000. If greater\r\nexactness be required, or it be found that the color given by the water\r\nis either darker or lighter than that given by all the standard\r\nsolutions, a new trial must be made. In such a case the water must be\r\nagain tested simultaneously with the solutions with which it is to be\r\ncompared. This is rendered necessary principally for the reason that the\r\nshade of the solutions to which the carbazol has been added is apt to\r\nchange on standing. Hence it is desirable that the water, and the\r\nstandard potassium nitrate with which it is to be compared, should have\r\nthe carbazol added at as nearly the same time as possible. When finally\r\nthe color falls between that given by any two consecutive members of the\r\nstandard potassium nitrate series, the estimation may be considered at\r\nan end, and the mean of these solutions taken as representing the\r\nnitrogen present.\r\n\r\nThe greatest neatness should be observed in all steps of the analysis.\r\nThe quantity of water operated upon is so small that if the greatest\r\ncare be not exercised throughout, sources of error may be readily\r\nintroduced. The test-tubes should be rinsed out with nitrate-free water\r\nbefore being used and then dried. The tint should be determined by\r\nlooking through the tube and not through the length of the column of\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Nitrites._—If the quantity of nitrous acid in the water is\r\nknown a correction can be applied for nitrates by deducting one-fifth of\r\nthe number found for nitrites when estimated as nitrates.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Iron._—Although ferrous salts give no reaction with\r\ncarbazol, nitrates are apt to be overestimated in their presence. Oh the\r\nother hand, ferric compounds, like other oxidizing agents, may give a\r\ncharacteristic green color with carbazol. In all cases when iron is\r\npresent in any considerable quantity it is best to remove it by\r\nrendering the water slightly alkaline, evaporating to dryness, and\r\nredissolving the soluble residue until the solution reaches the original\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Chlorids._—The presence of chlorids furnishes by far the\r\nmost serious source of error in the process by intensifying the action\r\nof the nitric acid. If, however, nitrates be absent chlorids give no\r\nreaction with carbazol. The chlorids are removed by a standard silver\r\nsulfate solution, the quantity of chlorids present having been first\r\ndetermined by a standard silver nitrate solution. For this purpose an\r\nordinary sugar flask can be employed marked at 100 and 110 cubic\r\ncentimeters. This flask is filled to the 100 cubic centimeter mark with\r\nthe water to be examined; the necessary quantity of silver sulfate is\r\nadded and then two cubic centimeters of the solution of aluminum\r\nsulfate, previously described, and the contents of the flask brought up\r\nto 110 cubic centimeters by the addition of pure distilled water. The\r\nwhole is shaken up and filtered, the first portion of the filtrate being\r\nrejected. The aluminum sulfate by reacting with the carbonates usually\r\npresent in the water and producing the precipitation of alumina,\r\nfacilitates the removal of the precipitated silver chlorid.\r\n\r\nThe above-described method on account of its delicacy is not well suited\r\nto aqueous solutions of soils except where the quantity of nitric\r\nnitrogen present is extremely minute.\r\n\r\nHooker also first suggested the use of diphenylamin for detecting the\r\npresence of nitrates,[326] a method afterwards worked out by\r\nSpiegel.[327]\r\n\r\nIn the variation of the method as practiced by Rideal the standard\r\npotassium nitrate and the pure sulfuric acid mentioned below are\r\nrequired, and in addition, the following reagents:[328]\r\n\r\n(a) Silver sulfate solution containing 4.3945 grams per liter.\r\n\r\n(b) Aluminum sulfate solution free from chlorids and iron, five grams\r\nper liter.\r\n\r\n(c) Carbazol solution; six-tenths gram carbazol dissolved in glacial\r\nacetic acid and made up to 100 cubic centimeters with the glacial acid.\r\nFor use, one cubic centimeter of this solution is withdrawn by a pipette\r\nand mixed with fifteen cubic centimeters of pure redistilled sulfuric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThe process is carried out as follows: To 100 cubic centimeters of water\r\nthe amount of chlorin which has been previously ascertained is removed\r\nby the silver sulfate solution. Two cubic centimeters of the aluminum\r\nsulfate are added and the whole made up to a convenient volume, say\r\nabout 110 cubic centimeters. The liquid is filtered and two cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate taken for an estimation of nitrates. To the\r\ntwo cubic centimeters are added four cubic centimeters of concentrated\r\nsulfuric acid and the mixture cooled.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of the carbazol solution in sulfuric acid is added\r\nand a bright green color appears in a few moments, if nitrates are\r\npresent. Comparison is made with solutions of standard potassium\r\nnitrate.\r\n\r\n=497. Phenylsulfuric Acid Method.=—Rideal also proposes a variation of\r\nthe method described by Hooker, which consists in the substitution of\r\nphenylsulfuric acid for carbazol.[329]\r\n\r\nThe solutions required are:\r\n\r\n(a) A standard solution of potassium nitrate containing 0.7215 gram of\r\nthe pure crystallized salt in a liter of water.\r\n\r\n(b) Phenylsulfuric acid, (acid phenyl sulfate,) prepared by dissolving\r\nfifteen grams of pure crystallized phenol in 92.5 cubic centimeters of\r\npure, redistilled sulfuric acid free from nitrates and diluted with\r\nseven and one-half cubic centimeters of water.\r\n\r\nThe process is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nA known volume of water, from twenty-five to one hundred cubic\r\ncentimeters, according to its richness in nitrates, is evaporated to\r\ndryness in a porcelain dish, one cubic centimeter of phenylsulfuric acid\r\nadded then one cubic centimeter of pure water and three drops of strong\r\nsulfuric acid and the mixture gently warmed. A yellow color shows the\r\npresence of nitrates. Dilute to about twenty-five cubic centimeters with\r\nwater and add ammonia in slight excess. Pour into a narrow nessler tube\r\nand add the washings and make up to 100 cubic centimeters. Imitate the\r\ncolor of the solution with the standard potassium nitrate treated with\r\nthe same reagents.\r\n\r\nThe phenylsulfuric acid should be prepared some time before use, as the\r\nfresh solution imparts a greenish tint to the yellow of the ammonium\r\npicrate formed.\r\n\r\n=498. Variation of Leffmann and Beam.=—The phenyl sulfate process, as\r\ndescribed by Leffmann and Beam, is conducted as follows:[330]\r\n\r\n_Solutions Required._—_Acid phenyl sulfate_: 18.5 cubic centimeters of\r\nstrong sulfuric acid are added to one and one-half cubic centimeters of\r\nwater and three grams of pure phenol. Preserve in a tightly-stoppered\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n_Standard potassium nitrate_: 0.722 gram of potassium nitrate,\r\npreviously heated to a temperature just sufficient to fuse it, is\r\ndissolved in water, and the solution made up to 1000 cubic centimeters.\r\nOne cubic centimeter of this solution will contain 0.0001 gram of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n_Analytical Process._—A measured volume of the water is evaporated just\r\nto dryness in a platinum or porcelain basin. One cubic centimeter of the\r\nacid phenyl sulfate is added and thoroughly mixed with the residue by\r\nmeans of a glass rod. One cubic centimeter of water, and three drops of\r\nstrong sulfuric acid are added, and the dish gently warmed. The liquid\r\nis then diluted with about twenty-five cubic centimeters of water,\r\nammonium hydroxid added in excess, and the solution made up to 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nThe reactions are:\r\n\r\n     Acid phenyl sulfate.            Trinitrophenol (picric acid).\r\n HC₆H₅SO₄ + 3HNO₃             = HC₆H₂(NO₂)₃O + H₂SO₄ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\n                                           Ammonium picrate.\r\n HC₆H₂(NO₂)₃O + NH₄HO         = NH₄C₆H₂(NO₂)₃O + H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe ammonium picrate imparts to the solution a yellow color, the\r\nintensity of which is proportional to the amount present.\r\n\r\nFive cubic centimeters of the standard solution of potassium nitrate are\r\nsimilarly evaporated in a platinum dish, treated as above, and made up\r\nto 100 cubic centimeters. The color produced is compared to that given\r\nby the water, and one or the other of the solutions diluted until the\r\ntints of the two agree. The comparative volumes of the liquids furnish\r\nthe necessary data for determining the amount of nitrate present, as the\r\nfollowing example will show:\r\n\r\nFive cubic centimeters of standard nitrate are treated as above, and\r\nmade up to 100 cubic centimeters, representing 0.0005 gram nitrogen.\r\n\r\nSuppose 100 cubic centimeters of water similarly treated are found to\r\nrequire dilution to 150 cubic centimeters before the tint will match\r\nthat of the standard; then\r\n\r\n                      100 : 150 :: 0.005 : 0.0075\r\n\r\n_i. e._, the water contains seven and one-half milligrams of nitrogen as\r\nnitrate per liter.\r\n\r\nThe ammonium picrate solution keeps very well, especially in the dark. A\r\ngood plan, therefore, is to make up a standard solution equivalent to,\r\nsay, ten milligrams of nitrogen as nitrate per liter, to which the color\r\nobtained from the water may be directly compared.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by this method are quite accurate. Care should be\r\ntaken that the same quantity of acid phenyl sulfate be used for the\r\nwater and for the comparison liquid, otherwise different tints instead\r\nof depths of tints are produced.\r\n\r\nWith subsoil and other waters probably containing much nitrates, ten\r\ncubic centimeters of the sample will be sufficient for the test, but\r\nwith river and spring waters, twenty-five to one hundred cubic\r\ncentimeters may be used. When the organic matter is sufficient to color\r\nthe residue, it will be well to purify the water by addition of alum and\r\nsubsequent filtration, before evaporating. The method may also be used\r\nto determine small quantities of nitrates in aqueous extracts of soils\r\nwhen the quantity is too small for estimation by the ferrous chlorid or\r\nreduction processes.\r\n\r\n=499. Variation of Johnson.=—The ammonium picrate method has given very\r\nsatisfactory results as practiced by Johnson, who varies the process as\r\ndescribed below.[331]\r\n\r\nThe standard solution of potassium nitrate is prepared by dissolving\r\n0.7215 gram of the pure salt in a liter of distilled water. Dilute 100\r\ncubic centimeters of this solution to one liter with distilled water.\r\nTen cubic centimeters of this dilute solution contain nitrogen\r\nequivalent to one part as nitrates in 100,000.\r\n\r\n_The Solution of Acid Phenyl Sulfate._—This is prepared by pouring two\r\nparts by measure of pure crystallized phenol liquefied by hot water into\r\nfive parts by measure of pure concentrated sulfuric acid and digesting\r\nthe whole in the water-bath for eight hours. After cooling, add one and\r\none-half volumes of distilled water and one-half volume strong\r\nhydrochloric acid to each volume of the above mixture.\r\n\r\nThe analytical processes are carried on as follows: Ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of the water under examination and ten cubic centimeters of\r\nthe standard potassium nitrate are placed in small beakers and put near\r\nthe edge of a hot plate. When nearly evaporated they are put on the top\r\nof the water-bath and left there until completely dry. The residue, in\r\neach case, is then treated with one cubic centimeter of the acid phenyl\r\nsulfate and the beakers placed on the top of the water-bath. In good\r\nwater, a red color ought not to appear for about ten minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter standing about fifteen minutes, the beakers are removed, the\r\ncontents of each washed successively into 100 cubic centimeter flasks,\r\nabout twenty cubic centimeters of 0.96 per cent. ammonia added, and the\r\n100 cubic centimeters made up by the addition of water and the yellow\r\nliquid transferred to the nessler glass and the tints appropriately\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\n=500. Estimation of Nitric in Presence of Nitrous Acid.=—The detection\r\nof nitrous in presence of nitric acid can be accomplished by the method\r\nproposed by Griess, as described further on, through the development of\r\nazocolors, with metaphenylenediamin and other bodies, which are not\r\nproduced under similar conditions by nitric acid. The detection and\r\nestimation of nitric in the presence of nitrous acid, however, is not so\r\neasy. Lunge and Lwoff propose brucin for this purpose, which, contrary\r\nto most authorities, does not give the red-yellow color with nitrous\r\nacid.[332] The reagent is prepared by dissolving two-tenths gram of\r\nbrucin in 100 cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid, pure and concentrated.\r\nIt is almost impossible to prepare a sulfuric acid which does not give a\r\ntrace of color with brucin; but with the purest acids this trace may be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nA solution of nitrate is also prepared containing 0.01 milligram of\r\nnitrogen as nitric acid in one cubic centimeter. It is made by\r\ndissolving 0.0721 gram of pure potassium nitrate in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of distilled water, and diluting ten cubic centimeters\r\nthereof with pure concentrated sulfuric acid to 100 cubic centimeters.\r\nBoth solutions are conveniently preserved in burettes with glass\r\nstop-cocks. The liquid to be tested for nitric acid should be mixed with\r\nsulfuric acid in such a way that the mixture will have a specific\r\ngravity of one and seven-tenths. If the liquid to be tested is water,\r\nthis concentration is reached by adding three times its volume of the\r\nstrong acid. For the comparison of colors, cylinders of colorless glass\r\nare employed, marked at fifty cubic centimeters. They should be about\r\ntwenty-four centimeters high and extend about ten centimeters above the\r\nmark. There is placed in the cylinder one cubic centimeter of the\r\nsolution of nitrate in sulfuric acid, and the same quantity of the\r\nbrucin mixture, and it is filled to the mark with pure sulfuric acid.\r\nThe contents of the cylinder are poured into a flask and warmed at from\r\n70°–80°, until the final yellow tint is secured, and then poured into\r\nthe cylinder again. The liquid to be tested is treated in exactly the\r\nsame way. The tints are then equalized by pouring out a part of the\r\ncontents of the deeper colored cylinder, taking account of the volume,\r\nand filling up with pure concentrated sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the content of nitric acid in the liquid under\r\nexamination can be compared directly with the solution of potassium\r\nnitrate of known strength. The coloration is distinctly produced with\r\n0.01 milligram in fifty cubic centimeters of liquid, at least\r\nthree-fourths of which must be sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n=501. Piccini Process.=—The method proposed by Piccini may also be\r\nused.[333]\r\n\r\nAbout five cubic centimeters of the nitrite solution are placed in a\r\nsmall beaker, some pure urea dissolved therein and a few drops of\r\nsulfuric acid, and then held in boiling water for three minutes. The\r\nnitrous acid is thus completely destroyed. Ammonium chlorid may be\r\nsubstituted for urea. The reaction is given on page 478. The nitric acid\r\npresent is then determined by diphenylamin or other suitable reagents.\r\nDiphenylamin reacts both with nitrous and nitric acids, producing a\r\nviolet tint. Warington calls attention to a slight difference, however,\r\nin its deportment with these two acids. When the solution of the reagent\r\nis not too strong a drop of it produces but little turbidity when added\r\nto water or to a solution containing nitric acid. When, however, nitrous\r\nacid is present, a cream-colored turbidity is produced. The violet color\r\nalso appears at once on adding sulfuric acid when a nitrite is present,\r\nwhile in the case of nitrates, more sulfuric acid is required, except\r\nwhen the solution is very strong. In this connection, it must not be\r\nforgotten that in heating nitrites with urea or ammonium chlorid in the\r\npresence of a slight excess of sulfuric acid a trace of nitric acid may\r\nbe formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n         ESTIMATION OF NITROUS ACID BY COLORIMETRIC COMPARISON.\r\n\r\n=502. Application of the Method.=—The most minute traces of nitrous acid\r\nmay be detected by colorimetric methods and the determination of the\r\nquantity present may be approximated with great exactness by comparison\r\nwith a solution of a nitrite of known strength. Especially in following\r\nthe progress of nitrification is this method, in some of its forms, of\r\nessential importance. In delicacy and celerity it has the same\r\nadvantages as the colorimetric methods for the determination of nitric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n=503. Metaphenylenediamin Method.=—This process depends upon the\r\ndevelopment of a yellow color in water containing nitrous acid on the\r\naddition of a reagent containing metaphenylenediamin; m-C₆H₄(NH₂)₂. This\r\nvariety of the phenylenediamins is readily obtained from common\r\ndinitrobenzene. It melts at 63° and boils at 287°. In order to preserve\r\nthe reagent in shape for use it should be prepared in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nDissolve two grams of the chlorid in ten cubic centimeters of ammonia,\r\nand place the solution in a glass-stoppered flask. To this solution are\r\nadded five grams of powdered animal-black, and the whole vigorously\r\nshaken. After allowing to settle, the shaking is repeated at intervals\r\nof an hour, three or four times, and the flask then allowed to remain at\r\nrest for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe supernatant liquid is generally sufficiently decolorized by this\r\ntreatment. If not, the shaking and subsidence must be repeated until a\r\ncompletely colorless liquid is obtained. The solution can be kept,\r\nindefinitely, in contact with the animal-black. Aqueous and alcoholic\r\nsolutions of the salt can not be kept.\r\n\r\nThe test is applied by mixing five drops of the reagent with five cubic\r\ncentimeters of sulfuric acid. The mixture must be colorless. To the\r\nmixture add 100 cubic centimeters of the water to be tested, and heat on\r\nthe water-bath for five minutes. A yellow coloration indicates the\r\npresence of nitrous acid.\r\n\r\nThe metaphenylenediamin test is fairly satisfactory in perfectly\r\ncolorless waters and aqueous extracts. Many waters and soil extracts,\r\nhowever, have a yellowish tint, and this interferes in a marked way with\r\na proper judgment of the yellow triaminazobenzol developed in the\r\napplication of the above test.\r\n\r\nThe decoloration of such waters by means of sodium carbonate or hydroxid\r\nand alum, is a matter of some difficulty and not wholly without action\r\non the nitrites which may be present. The method, therefore, is inferior\r\nto the one next described.\r\n\r\n=504. Sulfanilic Acid and Naphthylamin Test for Nitrous Acid.=—A very\r\ndelicate test for the presence of nitrous acid, first described by\r\nGriess, is the coloration produced thereby in an acid solution of\r\nsulfanilic acid and naphthylamin.[334]\r\n\r\nSulfuric or acetic acid may be used as the acidifying agent, preferably\r\nthe latter. The solutions are prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Dissolve one-half gram of sulfanilic acid in 150 cubic centimeters\r\nof dilute acetic acid.\r\n\r\n(2) Boil one-tenth gram of naphthylamin with twenty cubic centimeters of\r\nwater, decant the colorless solution from the residue and acidify it\r\nwith 150 cubic centimeters of dilute acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe two solutions may at once be mixed and preserved in a well-stoppered\r\nflask. The action of light on the mixture is not hurtful, but air should\r\nbe carefully excluded because of the traces of nitrous acid which it may\r\ncontain. Whenever the mixed solutions show a red tint it is an\r\nindication that they have absorbed some nitrous acid. The red color may\r\nbe discharged and the solution again fitted for use by the introduction\r\nof a little zinc dust, and shaking.\r\n\r\nThe water, or aqueous solution of a soil, to be tested for nitrites, in\r\nportions of about twenty cubic centimeters, is treated with a few cubic\r\ncentimeters of the mixed reagent and warmed to 70°–80°. If nitrous acid,\r\nin the proportion of one part to one million be present, the red color\r\nwill appear in a few minutes. If the content of nitrous acid be greater,\r\n_e. g._, one part in one thousand, only a yellow color will be produced,\r\nunless a greater quantity of the reagent be used.\r\n\r\nLeffmann and Beam recommend the following method of conducting the\r\ndeterminations.[335]\r\n\r\nSolutions required:\r\n\r\n_Naphthylammonium Chlorid._—Saturated solution in water free from\r\nnitrites. It should be colorless; a small quantity of animal charcoal\r\nallowed to remain in the bottle will keep it in this condition.\r\n\r\n_Paraamidobenzene Sulfonic Acid (Sulfanilic Acid)._—Saturated solution\r\nin water, free from nitrites.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochloric Acid._—Twenty-five cubic centimeters of concentrated pure\r\nhydrochloric acid added to seventy-five cubic centimeters of water, free\r\nfrom nitrites.\r\n\r\n_Standard Sodium Nitrite._—0.275 gram pure silver nitrite is dissolved\r\nin pure water, and a dilute solution of pure sodium chlorid added until\r\nthe precipitate ceases to form. It is then diluted with pure water to\r\n250 cubic centimeters and allowed to stand until clear. For use, ten\r\ncubic centimeters of this solution are diluted to 100. It is to be kept\r\nin the dark.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of the dilute solution is equivalent to 0.00001\r\ngram of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe silver nitrite is prepared in the following manner: A hot\r\nconcentrated solution of silver nitrate is added to a concentrated\r\nsolution of the purest sodium or potassium nitrite available, filtered\r\nwhile hot and allowed to cool. The silver nitrite will separate in fine\r\nneedle-like crystals, which are freed from the mother-liquor by\r\nfiltration with the aid of a filter pump. The crystals are dissolved in\r\nthe smallest possible quantity of hot water, allowed to cool and\r\ncrystallize, and again separated by means of the pump. They are then\r\nthoroughly dried in the water-bath, and preserved in a tightly-stoppered\r\nbottle away from the light. Their purity may be tested by heating a\r\nweighed quantity to redness in a tared, porcelain crucible and noting\r\nthe weight of the metallic silver. One hundred and fifty-four parts of\r\nsilver nitrite leave a residue of 108 parts of silver.\r\n\r\n_Analytical Process._—One hundred cubic centimeters of the water are\r\nplaced in one of the color-comparison cylinders, the measuring vessel\r\nand cylinder having previously been rinsed with the water to be tested.\r\nBy means of a pipette, one cubic centimeter each of the solutions of\r\nsulfanilic acid, dilute hydrochloric acid, and naphthylammonium chlorid\r\nis dropped into the water in the order named. It is convenient to have\r\nthree pipettes for this test, and to use them for no other purpose. In\r\nany case the pipette must be rinsed out thoroughly with nitrite-free\r\nwater each time before using, as nitrites, in quantity sufficient to\r\ngive a distinct reaction, may be taken up from the air.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of the standard nitrite solution is placed in\r\nanother clean cylinder, made up with nitrite-free water to 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters and treated with the reagents, as above.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of nitrites a pink color is produced, which, in dilute\r\nsolutions, may require half an hour for complete development. At the end\r\nof this time the two solutions are compared, the colors equalized by\r\ndiluting the darker, and the calculation made as explained under the\r\nestimation of nitrates.\r\n\r\nThe following are the reactions:\r\n\r\n    Paraamidobenzene        Nitrous acid.         Paradiazobenzene sulfonic acid.\r\n     sulfonic acid.\r\n      C₆H₄NH₂HSO₃ +             HNO₂         =           C₆H₄N₂SO₃ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\n                          Naphthylammonium     Azoalphaamidonaphthalene parazobenzene\r\n                              chlorid.                     sulfonic acid.\r\n       C₆H₄N₂SO₃ +           C₁₀H₇NH₃Cl      =      C₁₀H₆(NH₂)NNC₆H₄HSO₃ + HCl.\r\n\r\nThe last named body gives the color to the liquid.\r\n\r\nThe method pursued by Tanner, in the preparation of the reagent, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nSulfanilic acid is prepared by mixing thirty grams of anilin slowly,\r\nwith sixty grams of fuming sulfuric acid, in a porcelain dish. The\r\nbrown, sirupy liquid formed is carefully heated until quite dark in\r\ncolor, and until the evolution of sulfurous fumes is noticed. After\r\ncooling, the thick, semi-fluid mass is poured into half a liter of cold\r\nwater and allowed to stand for some hours. The liquid portion is then\r\ndecanted from the nearly black undissolved crystalline mass. To the\r\nresidue half a liter of hot water is added and allowed to stand until\r\ncold, and the liquid again decanted. The undissolved portion is then\r\ntreated with one liter of hot water and filtered. The filtrate is\r\ntreated with animal charcoal to decolorize it, and allowed to stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours and again filtered, the filtrate diluted to 1,500\r\ncubic centimeters and used as required. This solution tends to turn pink\r\non keeping, and thus its color interferes with the delicacy of the test,\r\nand a small amount of animal-char is kept in a small bottle containing\r\nthe portion for immediate use, and this bottle is filled, from time to\r\ntime, from the larger one.\r\n\r\nThe solution of naphthylamin hydrochlorate is made with one gram of the\r\nsalt dissolved in 100 cubic centimeters of water. The solution is to be\r\noccasionally filtered, and not more than 100 cubic centimeters should be\r\nprepared at a time.\r\n\r\nThe analytical operations are carried on as follows:\r\n\r\nA standard solution of pure potassium nitrite, made from the silver salt\r\nin distilled water perfectly free from nitrites, is placed in a\r\ncolor-glass, similar to those used in the nessler reaction, together\r\nwith a second glass containing the water to be tested. These glasses\r\nshould be marked to hold 100 cubic centimeters at the same depth. To\r\neach of the tubes a few drops of pure hydrochloric acid are added and\r\ntwo cubic centimeters of the sulfanilic solution. Afterwards, to each\r\ntube are added two cubic centimeters of the solution of naphthylamin\r\nhydrochlorate, and it is allowed to stand for twenty minutes, at the end\r\nof which time the color should be fully developed. Each tube is covered\r\nby a piece of glass in order to prevent access of air. It is unnecessary\r\nto add that the standard solutions of nitrite of different strength\r\nshould be employed until the one is found which resembles, as nearly as\r\npossible, the color developed in the sample of water under examination.\r\n\r\n=505. Lunge and Lwoff’s Process for Nitrous Acid.=—The reaction of\r\nnitrous acid with α naphthylamin, first described by Griess, may be made\r\nreliable, quantitatively, by proceeding as below:[336]\r\n\r\nBoil 0.100 gram of pure white α naphthylamin for fifteen minutes with\r\n100 cubic centimeters of water, add five cubic centimeters of glacial\r\nacetic acid, or its equivalent of dilute acid, and afterwards one gram\r\nof sulfanilic acid dissolved in 100 cubic centimeters of hot water. The\r\nmixture is kept in a well-closed flask. A slight red tint in the mixture\r\nis of no significance, inasmuch as this completely disappears when one\r\npart of it is mixed with fifty parts of the liquid to be examined. If\r\nthe coloration be very strong it can be removed by adding a little zinc\r\ndust. One cubic centimeter of this reagent will give a distinct\r\ncoloration with 0.001 milligram of nitrous nitrogen in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water.\r\n\r\nThe analysis is conducted in cylinders of white glass marked at fifty\r\ncubic centimeters. One cubic centimeter of the above reagent is placed\r\nin each of two cylinders with forty cubic centimeters of water and five\r\ngrams of solid sodium acetate. In one of the cylinders is placed one\r\ncubic centimeter of a normal solution of a nitrite prepared by\r\ndissolving 0.0493 gram of pure sodium nitrite corresponding to ten\r\nmilligrams of nitrogen in 100 cubic centimeters of water, and adding ten\r\ncubic centimeters of this solution to ninety cubic centimeters of pure\r\nsulfuric acid. This secures a normal solution of nitrosylsulfuric acid,\r\nof which each cubic centimeter corresponds to 0.01 milligram of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nIn the other cylinder is placed one cubic centimeter of the solution to\r\nbe examined, and the contents of both cylinders are well mixed so that\r\nthe nitrous acid in a nascent state may act on the reagent. The colors\r\nare compared after any convenient period, but, as a rule, after five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe chief improvement made by Lunge and Lwoff on the method of Griess is\r\nin keeping the reagent in a mixed state ready for use, by means of which\r\nany nitrous impurities in the components thereof are surely indicated.\r\nIts advantage over the method of Ilosvay[337] consists in using the\r\ncomparative normal nitrite solution as nitrosylsulfuric acid, in which\r\nstate it is much more stable.\r\n\r\n=506. Estimation of Nitrous Acid with Starch as Indicator.=—The method\r\nof procedure, depending on the blue color produced in a solution of\r\nstarch in presence of a nitrite and zinc iodid when treated with\r\nsulfuric acid, is not of wide application on account of the interference\r\nproduced by organic matter. The soil extract or water is treated in a\r\ntest-tube, with a few drops of starch solution and some zinc iodid, to\r\nwhich is added some sulfuric acid. The decomposition of the nitrite is\r\nattended with the setting free of an equivalent amount of iodin which\r\ngives a blue coloration to the starch solution. The depth of the tint is\r\nimitated by treating a standard solution of nitrite in a similar way\r\nuntil the proper quantity is found, which gives at once the proportion\r\nof nitrite in the sample examined. This process, however, is scarcely\r\nmore than a qualitative one.\r\n\r\n=507. Estimation of Nitrites by the Method of Chabrier.=—In order to\r\nmake the estimation of the evolved nitrous acid more definite by the\r\niodin method, Chabrier has elaborated a plan for titrating it with a\r\nreducing agent.[338]\r\n\r\nThe substance chosen for this purpose is sodium hyposulfite. In point of\r\nfact, it is not the nitrous acid which is attacked by the hyposulfite,\r\nbut the equivalent amount of free iodin representing it. In the case of\r\na soil where the quantity of nitrites is usually very small, it is well\r\nto take as much as one kilogram. The extraction should be made rapidly,\r\nwith water, free of nitrites, in order to avoid any reducing action on\r\nthe nitrates which may be present. In the case of water, from five to\r\nten liters should be evaporated to a small volume. The concentration\r\nshould take place in a large flask, rather than in an open dish, in\r\norder to avoid any possibility of the absorption of nitrites produced by\r\ncombustion. When the volume has been reduced to about 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters it is transferred to a small flask and the concentration\r\ncontinued until only ten or fifteen cubic centimeters are left. The\r\nresidue is filtered into a woulff bottle, F, Fig. 89, of about 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters capacity.\r\n\r\nOne of the side tubulures carries a burette, B, containing five per cent\r\nsulfuric acid, the other one filled with a hyposulfite solution of known\r\nstrength. The middle tubule serves to introduce a glass tube through\r\nwhich carbon dioxid or illuminating gas passes for the purpose of\r\ndriving out the air from the solution and the flask. If carbon dioxid be\r\nused it should be generated by the action of sulfuric acid on marble.\r\nThe cork holding this is furnished with a slot or valve to permit the\r\nexit of the air and the excess of the gas.\r\n\r\nBefore inserting the middle stopper, a few cubic centimeters of\r\npotassium iodid solution and a few drops of thin starch paste are added,\r\nthe potassium salt being always used in excess of the nitrite supposed\r\nto be present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 89. METHOD OF CHABRIER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter the air has all been expelled from the flask the analytical\r\nprocess is commenced, the carbon dioxid current being slowly continued.\r\nAt first, a few drops of the dilute sulfuric acid are allowed to flow\r\ninto the flask. As soon as the liquid is colored blue a sufficient\r\nquantity of the thiosulfate solution is added to discharge the color.\r\nThe successive addition of acid and thiosulfate is continued until\r\nanother portion of the acid fails to develop the blue color, thus\r\nindicating that all the nitrite has been decomposed. From the volume of\r\nthiosulfate used the quantity of nitrite is calculated.\r\n\r\n_The Thiosulfate Solution._—The thiosulfate solution is conveniently\r\nprepared, when a large number of analyses is to be made, by dissolving\r\ntwenty-five grams of pure crystallized sodium thiosulfate in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water and diluting any convenient part thereof to 100 or\r\n1,000 cubic centimeters, according to the supposed strength of nitrite\r\nsolution under examination.\r\n\r\nFor fixing the strength of the solution dissolve 3 348 grams of pure\r\niodin in a solution of potassium iodid and make the volume up to one\r\nliter. Each cubic centimeter of this solution corresponds to one\r\nmilligram of nitrous acid. A given volume of the iodin solution is\r\ntitrated against the thiosulfate, but it is best not to add the starch\r\npaste until the greater part of the iodin has been removed. The starch\r\npaste is then added and the titration continued until the blue color has\r\nbeen discharged. Ten cubic centimeters of the iodin solution is a\r\nconvenient quantity for the titration and the thiosulfate should be\r\ndiluted by adding to ten cubic centimeters of the solution mentioned\r\nabove, 990 cubic centimeters of water. Each liter of this dilute\r\nsolution contains two and a half grams of the sodium thiosulphate.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Let us suppose that it has required 21.3 cubic centimeters of\r\nthiosulfate to absorb ten cubic centimeters of the iodin solution;\r\nfurther that ten liters of water have been evaporated and titrated as\r\ndescribed above, and that the volume of thiosulfate employed was 13.8\r\ncubic centimeters. From this is derived the following formula: (13.8 ×\r\n10)/(21.3) = 6.48 milligrams of nitrous acid; or 0.648 milligram per\r\nliter.\r\n\r\n=508. Estimation of Nitrous Acid By Coloration of Solution of Ferrous\r\nSalt.=—This method, due to Picini is based on the production of the\r\nwell-known brown color formed by the action of nitric oxid on a ferrous\r\nsalt.[339] The nitrite is decomposed by heating with acetic acid while\r\nnitrates thus treated do not develop the reaction. The tint produced is\r\nimitated as above by testing against a standard solution of nitrite.\r\nFerrous chlorid is to be preferred to other ferrous salts for the above\r\npurpose. The process should be carried on in solutions free of air.\r\n\r\n=509. Estimation of Nitrous Acid By Decomposition with Potassium\r\nFerrocyanid.=—The method of Schaeffer was first described in 1851, but\r\nlittle attention has been paid to it since. The method has lately been\r\nbrought into notice again by Deventer.[340]\r\n\r\nThe reaction depends upon the decomposition of nitrous acid by potassium\r\nferrocyanid in the presence of acetic acid with the formation of\r\npotassium ferricyanid and acetate, and nitric oxid. The reaction is\r\nexpressed by the following equation:\r\n\r\n                       2K₄FeCy₆ + 2HNO₂ + 2C₂H₄O₂\r\n                  = K₆Fe₂Cy₁₂ + 2KC₂H₃O₂ + 2NO + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 90.\r\n\r\n  SCHAEFFER’S NITROUS ACID METHOD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA eudiometer with a glass stop-cock is arranged as shown in Fig. 90. The\r\nlower part of the eudiometer is closed with a rubber stopper carrying a\r\nglass tube which ends in the pan _f_ as shown at _e_. The eudiometer is\r\nfilled to the stop-cock with a solution of potassium ferrocyanid of\r\nabout fourteen per cent strength. The dish _f_ is also filled up to the\r\nheight indicated in the figure with the same solution. The solution of\r\nnitrite is used in such quantities that the nitric oxid evolved will\r\noccupy a space of about twenty cubic centimeters. The whole eudiometer\r\nshould contain about fifty-seven cubic centimeters. The nitrite solution\r\nis added to the eudiometer by means of a funnel, _a_. The vessel\r\ncontaining it is washed out with a little water and then with acetic\r\nacid and finally with a few cubic centimeters of strong potassium\r\nferrocyanid solution. The last fluid flows through the solution of\r\nnitrite and acetic acid and thus mixes it with the solution already in\r\nthe eudiometer. The liquids reacting on each other float together on the\r\nstrong ferrocyanid solution and each one of them is at once pressed\r\ndownward by the gases which are evolved. When the evolution of gas\r\nbecomes slower the apparatus should be shaken for about twenty minutes,\r\nmoving it back and forth without taking the bottom of it out of the\r\ndish. When there is no longer any evolution of gas, water is added\r\nthrough a slowly, until the heavy potassium ferrocyanid solution is\r\nalmost completely driven out of the eudiometer. The opening of the tube\r\nat _e_ is then closed with the thumb, the apparatus is taken out of the\r\ndish, shaken for some time in a vertical direction and again placed in\r\nthe dish. Water of any required temperature is now allowed to flow\r\nthrough the jacket, _g_, _h_, until the temperature is constant, when\r\nthe volume of nitric oxid is read. The whole experiment can be performed\r\nin less than an hour. Operating in this way, at the end there is in the\r\neudiometer a liquid which is not very different from water and one whose\r\ncoefficient of solubility for nitric oxid is practically the same as\r\nthat of water. The gas volume read is to be corrected for temperature,\r\npressure, tension of the aqueous vapor, height of the water column in\r\nthe eudiometer, and, after the end of the calculation, five per cent of\r\nthe volume of water remaining in the eudiometer is to be added to the\r\nvolume of gas obtained. This is to compensate for the volume of the gas\r\nabsorbed by the water. The method gives good quantitive results.\r\n\r\n=510. Method of Collecting Samples of Rain Water for\r\nAnalysis.=—Warington collects rain water in a large leaden gauge having\r\nan area of 0.001 of an acre.[341] Of the daily collection of rain, dew,\r\nand snow water, an aliquot part amounting to a gallon for each inch of\r\nprecipitation is placed in a carboy; at the end of each month the\r\ncontents of the carboy are mixed, and a sample taken for analysis. In\r\nthe carboy receiving the rain for nitric acid estimation a little\r\nmercuric chlorid is placed each month with the view of preventing any\r\nchange of ammonia into nitric acid. It may be doubted, however, if this\r\nprecaution is necessary, as the rain water thus collected always\r\ncontains a very appreciable amount of lead; and experiments have shown\r\nthat on the whole, rain water more frequently gains than loses ammonia\r\nby keeping.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Sample._—The method first employed by Warington was\r\nto concentrate ten pounds of the rain water in a retort, a little\r\nmagnesia being used to decompose any ammonium nitrite or nitrate\r\npresent. Concentration by evaporation in the open air, and especially\r\nover gas, results in a distinct addition to nitrites present. When\r\nconcentrated to a small bulk, the water is filtered and evaporated to\r\ndryness in a very small beaker. The nitrogen as nitrates and nitrites is\r\nthen determined by means of the methods already described.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF FREE AND ALBUMINOID AMMONIA IN RAIN AND DRAINAGE WATERS\r\n                           AND SOIL EXTRACTS.\r\n\r\n=511. Nessler Process.=—The quantities of free ammonia in rain and most\r\ndrainage waters are minute, but may reach considerable magnitude in some\r\nsewages. By reason of these minute proportions, gravi- and volumetric\r\nmethods are not suitable for its quantitive determination. Recourse is\r\ntherefore had to the delicate colorimetric reaction first proposed by\r\nNessler. This reaction is based on the yellowish-brown coloration\r\nproduced by ammonia in a solution of mercuric iodid in potassium iodid.\r\nThe coloration is due to the formation of oxydimercuric ammonium iodid,\r\nNH₂Hg₂OI, and takes place between the molecule of free ammonia and the\r\nmercuric iodid dissolved in the alkaline potassium iodid as represented\r\nby the following equation:\r\n\r\n                   Hg—O—Hg—I              Hg\r\n                /                        /  \\\r\n              O              + 2H₂N = 2O       NH₂I + H₂O\r\n                \\                        \\   /\r\n                   Hg—O—Hg—I              HG\r\n\r\n_Nessler Reagent._—Dissolve thirty-five grams of potassium iodid in 100\r\ncubic centimeters of water. Add to this solution gradually a solution of\r\nseventeen grams of mercuric chlorid in 300 cubic centimeters of water\r\nuntil a permanent precipitate of mercuric iodid is formed. Add now\r\nenough of a twenty per cent solution of sodium hydroxid to make 1000\r\ncubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe mixed solutions, at room temperature, are treated with additional\r\nmercuric chlorid until the precipitate formed, after thorough stirring,\r\nremains undissolved. This precipitate is then allowed to subside, and\r\nwhen the supernatant liquid is perfectly clear, it is decanted or\r\nfiltered through asbestos and kept in a well-stoppered bottle in a dark\r\nplace. The part in use should be transferred to a smaller bottle as\r\nrequired. The solution should be made for a few days before using, since\r\nits delicacy is increased by keeping. The nessler reagent should show a\r\nfaint yellow tint. If colorless it is not delicate, and shows the\r\naddition of an insufficient quantity of mercuric chlorid. When properly\r\nprepared, two cubic centimeters of the reagent poured into fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of water containing 0.05 milligram of ammonia will at once\r\ndevelop a yellowish-brown tint.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Ammonia-Free Water._—To pure distilled water add pure,\r\nrecently-ignited sodium carbonate, from one to two grams per one liter,\r\nand distill. When one-fourth of the whole has passed over, the\r\ndistillate may be regarded as free from ammonia; fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof the following distillate should give no reaction with the nessler\r\nreagent. The distillation should be continued until the residual volume\r\nin the retort is about one-fourth of the original, and the distillate\r\nfree of ammonia is carefully preserved in close glass-stoppered bottles\r\npreviously washed with ammonia-free water. Pure water, free of ammonia\r\nmay also be obtained by distilling with sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n_Comparative Solution of Ammonium Chlorid containing 0.00001 gram\r\nAmmonia in one cubic centimeter._—Dissolve 3.15 grams H₄NCl in\r\nammonia-free water and make the volume up to one liter. Take ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of the above solution and dilute to 1000 with water, free\r\nfrom ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Solution containing 0.00001 gram Nitrogen in one cubic\r\ncentimeter._—Dissolve 3.82 grams H₄NCl in water, free from ammonia and\r\ndilute with same to 1000 cubic centimeters. Dilute ten cubic centimeters\r\nof the above solution to 1000.\r\n\r\n_The Distillation._—Any kind of suitable retort or flask connected with\r\na good condenser may be used. The capacity of the retort should be from\r\n700 to 1,000 cubic centimeters. The retort and condenser preferred by\r\nLeffmann and Beam are shown in Fig. 91. Any good lamp may be used in\r\nwhich the flame is under complete control. The gauze burner shown in the\r\nfigure is easily controlled and distributes the heat evenly over the\r\nsurface of the retort thus diminishing the danger of fracture. The\r\napparatus having been previously rinsed with distilled water receives\r\n500 cubic centimeters of the liquid to be tested for ammonia, together\r\nwith a few pieces of recently ignited pumice stone to prevent bumping\r\nand five cubic centimeters of the twenty percent sodium carbonate\r\nsolution to render its contents alkaline. The water is raised to the\r\nboiling-point and with gentle ebullition fifty cubic centimeters of\r\ndistillate collected. The distillate is conveniently collected in a\r\ncolor-comparison cylinder of thin white glass and flat bottom, about two\r\nand a half centimeters in diameter, and marked at fifty and one hundred\r\ncubic centimeters. Two cubic centimeters of the nessler reagent are\r\nadded and if ammonia be present a yellowish-brown color will be\r\ndeveloped, the intensity of which is matched by taking portions of the\r\nammonium chlorid solution, diluting to fifty cubic centimeters with pure\r\nwater and treating with the same quantity of the nessler reagent. The\r\nprocess is repeated until a distillate is obtained which gives no\r\nreaction for ammonia. The sum of the quantities obtained in the several\r\ndistillates gives the total amount of ammonia in the 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the water taken. In most cases practically all the\r\nammonia is obtained in three or four portions of the distillate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 91. RETORT FOR DISTILLING AMMONIA.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Albuminoid Ammonia._—The residue from the process just described is\r\nemployed for the purpose of determining the albuminoid ammonia. Two\r\nhundred grams of potassium hydroxid and eight grams of potassium\r\npermanganate are dissolved in 1,000 parts of distilled water. Fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of the solution are placed in a porcelain dish with\r\n100 cubic centimeters of distilled water and evaporated to fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters. This liquid is placed in the retort and the distillation\r\nresumed and continued until an ammonia-free distillate is obtained. The\r\ntotal albuminoid ammonia is determined by taking the sum of the\r\nquantities in the several distillates.\r\n\r\n=512. Nessler Reagent of Ilosvay.=—To secure greater delicacy in\r\nnesslerizing, Ilosvay uses a reagent prepared as follows:[342]\r\n\r\nDissolve two grams of potassium iodid in five cubic centimeters of\r\nwater, heat the solution gently, and add three grams of mercuric iodid.\r\nAfter the solution is cooled, add an additional portion of three grams\r\nof the mercury salt, and then twenty cubic centimeters of water, and\r\nwait until the precipitation is complete. After filtering, there are\r\nadded to the filtrate from twenty to thirty cubic centimeters of a\r\ntwenty per cent solution of potassium hydroxid. Only the limpid\r\nsupernatant liquid is used in the analytical work. With this reagent,\r\nIlosvay has been able to detect 0.02 milligram of ammonia in 110 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   AUTHORITIES CITED IN PART SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nFootnote 274:\r\n\r\n  Comptes rendus, Tome 84, pp. 301, et seq.

Further Examination of Waters.=—Having described in the preceding\r\npart the approved methods of determining the oxidized nitrogen in waters\r\nand soil extracts there remains to be considered the examination of\r\nwaters for other substances of importance to agriculture. Rain waters\r\nadd practically nothing to the soil but nitric acid and ammonia, and,\r\ntherefore, demand no further discussion here. In drainage and sewage\r\nwaters, in addition to the oxidized nitrogen, there may be sufficient\r\nquantities of phosphoric acid and potash to make their further analysis\r\nof interest. But by far the most practical point to be considered is in\r\nthe case of waters used for irrigation purposes where the continued\r\naddition to the soil of mineral matters may eventually convert fertile\r\nfields into barren wastes. In irrigated lands there is practically no\r\ndrainage and the whole of the water is removed by superficial\r\nevaporation. It is easily seen how these mineral matters tend to\r\naccumulate in that part of the soil in which the rootlets of plants seek\r\ntheir nourishment.\r\n\r\n=514. Estimation of Total Solid Matter.=—The total solid contents of a\r\nsample of water are determined by evaporating a known volume or weight\r\nto dryness and weighing the residue. For comparative purposes a given\r\nvolume of water may be taken if the solid contents do not exceed four\r\ngrams in a United States gallon. The water should be measured at a\r\ntemperature of about 15°.5. Where the content of mineral matter is\r\ngreater it is best to weigh the water and calculate the solid contents\r\nto parts per one hundred thousand. For practical purposes in the United\r\nStates it is customary to state the content of solid matter in grains\r\nper gallon. Since, however, the gallon has so many different values it\r\nis always necessary to indicate what particular measure is meant.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary spring and well waters the volume to be used is conveniently\r\ntaken at 100 cubic centimeters. To avoid calculation a volume in cubic\r\ncentimeters corresponding to some decimal part of a gallon in grains may\r\nbe taken and the weight in milligrams will then be equivalent to the\r\ngrains per gallon. Thus in the imperial gallon which contains 70,000\r\ngrains of distilled water at 15°.5, seventy cubic centimeters may be\r\ntaken. If the residue weigh twenty-five milligrams the water contains\r\ntwenty-five grains of solid matter per gallon. The United States gallon\r\nat 15°.5 contains 58,304 grains of distilled water. In this case 58.3\r\ncubic centimeters should be used, or double this amount and the weight\r\nin milligrams be divided by two.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation may be made in a platinum, porcelain, or aluminum dish,\r\npreferably with a flat bottom; The dish does not need to hold the whole\r\nvolume at once, but the water may be added from time to time as the\r\nevaporation continues. The dish, however, should, as a rule, hold not\r\nless than 100 cubic centimeters. The evaporation is best conducted over\r\na steam-bath, and after the complete disappearance of the liquid the\r\nheating should be continued until the residue is perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nIn the case of mineral waters highly impregnated with inorganic salts, a\r\nsmaller volume or weight may be taken, and greater care must be\r\nexercised in drying the residue. For the purpose of qualitively\r\ndetermining the percentage of special ingredients, quantities of the\r\nwater should be taken inversely corresponding to the content of the\r\ningredient desired. In general, it will not be necessary to evaporate\r\nthe sample to complete dryness, but only to concentrate it to a volume\r\nconvenient for the application of the analytical process. Where a\r\ncomplete quantitive analysis of the solid residue is desired, a\r\nsufficient quantity of the water is evaporated to give a weighable\r\namount of the least abundant ingredient. The total solid content of the\r\nwater having been previously determined, the actual weight or volume of\r\nthe water taken to obtain the above residue is of no importance.\r\n\r\n=515. Estimation of the Chlorin.=—The chlorin in the solid residue from\r\na sample of water may be determined directly by dissolving the soluble\r\nsalts in distilled water, to which enough nitric acid is added to\r\npreserve the solution slightly acid. After filtering and washing, silver\r\nchlorid is added, little by little, with constant shaking until a\r\nfurther addition of the reagent produces no further precipitate. The\r\nbeaker or flask should be placed in a dark place, on a shaking apparatus\r\nwhich is kept in motion until the precipitate has entirely settled in a\r\ngranular state. The silver chlorid is then collected on a gooch, washed\r\nfree of all soluble matter, dried at 150° and weighed. If the\r\nprecipitate be ignited to incipient fusion, a porcelain gooch should be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nA more convenient method is to determine the chlorin directly in the\r\nwater, or, where the quantity is too minute, after proper concentration,\r\nvolumetrically by means of a titrated solution of silver nitrate, using\r\npotassium chromate as indicator. As soon as the chlorin has all united\r\nwith the silver, any additional quantity of the silver nitrate will form\r\nred silver chromate, the permanent appearance of which indicates the end\r\nof the reaction. This process is especially applicable to water, which\r\nin a neutral state contains no other acids capable of precipitating\r\nsilver. The chromate indicator does not work well in an acid solution.\r\n\r\n=516. Solutions Employed.=—A quantity of pure silver nitrate, about five\r\ngrams, is dissolved in pure water and made up to a volume of one liter.\r\nFor determining the actual strength of the solution, 0.824 gram of pure\r\nsodium chlorid is dissolved in water and the volume made up to half a\r\nliter. Twenty-five cubic centimeters of this solution are placed in a\r\nporcelain dish, and a few drops of the solution of potassium chromate\r\nadded. The silver nitrate solution is allowed to flow into the porcelain\r\ndish from a burette graduated to tenths of a cubic centimeter. The red\r\ncolor produced as each drop falls, disappears on stirring as long as\r\nthere is any undecomposed chlorid. Finally a point is reached when the\r\nred color becomes permanent, a single drop in excess of the silver\r\nnitrate being sufficient to impart a faint red tint to the contents of\r\nthe dish.\r\n\r\nThe solution of potassium chromate is prepared by dissolving five grams\r\nof the salt in 100 cubic centimeters of water. Silver nitrate solution\r\nis added until a permanent red precipitate is produced, which is removed\r\nby filtration, and the filtrate is employed as the indicator as above\r\ndescribed. Water with any considerable quantity of chlorin can be\r\ntreated directly with the reagents; when the percentage of chlorin is\r\nlow, previous concentration to a convenient volume is advisable.\r\n\r\nIn waters containing bromids and iodids these halogens would be included\r\nwith the chlorin estimated as above. For agricultural purposes such\r\nwaters have little importance. In the case of soluble carbonates capable\r\nof precipitating silver this action can be prevented by acidifying the\r\nwater with nitric acid and afterwards removing the excess of acid with\r\nprecipitated calcium carbonate. In this reaction McElroy recommends the\r\nuse of Congo paper, which is not affected by the carbon dioxid but is\r\nturned blue as soon as an excess of nitric acid is added. After the\r\naddition of the calcium carbonate the mixture should be boiled to expel\r\ncarbon dioxid.[343]\r\n\r\nIrrigation waters from natural sources or derived from sewage rarely\r\ncontain enough chlorin to make their use objectionable. On the other\r\nhand, when water is obtained for this purpose from artesian wells it may\r\noften contain a quantity of chlorin which will eventually do more harm\r\nto the arable soil than the water will do good.\r\n\r\n=517. Carbon Dioxid.=—Free carbon dioxid in water has no significance in\r\nrespect of its use for irrigation purposes. Such waters, however, are\r\nusually of a highly mineral nature and thus are justly open to suspicion\r\nwhen used for farm animals and on the field. The presence of free carbon\r\ndioxid as has already been pointed out in paragraph =42=, gives to\r\nwater, one of its chief sources of power as an agent for dissolving\r\nrocks and ultimately forming soil. The estimation of the total free\r\ncarbon dioxid in a sample of water issuing from a spring or well is a\r\nmatter of some delicacy by reason of the tendency of this gas to escape\r\nas soon as the water reaches the open air and is relieved from the\r\nnatural pressure to which it has been subjected. The actual quantity of\r\nthe gas remaining in solution at any given time is determined as\r\nfollows: 100 cubic centimeters of the water are placed in a flask with\r\nthree cubic centimeters of a saturated solution of calcium and two of\r\nammonium chlorid. To this mixture is added forty-five cubic centimeters\r\nof a titrated solution of calcium hydroxid. The flask is stoppered, well\r\nshaken, and set aside for twelve hours to allow the complete separation\r\nof the calcium carbonate formed.\r\n\r\nWhen the supernatant liquid is perfectly clear an aliquot part thereof,\r\nfrom fifty to one hundred cubic centimeters, is removed and titrated\r\nwith decinormal acid with phenacetolin or lacmoid as an indicator. From\r\nthe quantity of calcium hydroxid remaining unprecipitated the amount\r\nwhich has been converted into carbonate can be determined by difference.\r\nThe difference between the quantity of calcium hydroxid originally\r\npresent in the solution and that remaining after the above treatment\r\nmultiplied by the factor 0.0022 will give the weight of carbon dioxid\r\npresent in the water in a free state or in excess of that present as\r\nnormal carbonates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     UNUSUAL CONSTITUENTS OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n=518. Boric Acid.=—Boron, while not regarded as an essential plant food,\r\nis yet found quite uniformly in the ashes of a large number of plants.\r\nIt may, therefore, be of some interest to the agricultural analyst to\r\ndetermine the amount of it which may be present in a soil extract or\r\nmineral water. For this purpose the following method due to Gooch may be\r\nemployed.[344] To one liter of the water supposed to contain boric acid\r\nadd enough sodium carbonate to produce distinct alkalinity. After\r\nevaporation to dryness acidify the residue with hydrochloric acid, apply\r\na piece of turmeric paper and dry at a moderate heat. The usual\r\nbrown-red tint will reveal the presence of boric acid.\r\n\r\nThe quantitive estimation of the acid is accomplished as follows: One or\r\nmore liters of the water rendered alkaline as above are evaporated to\r\ndryness. With the aid of as small a quantity as possible of acetic acid\r\nthe dry residue is transferred to a distillation flask and condenser\r\narranged as shown in Fig. 92. About one gram of recently ignited pure\r\nlime, cooled in a desiccator and weighed accurately, is introduced into\r\nthe flask at the bottom of the condenser and slaked by a few cubic\r\ncentimeters of water. When the flask is attached, the terminal tube of\r\nthe condensing apparatus should dip into the lime-water in the flask.\r\nThe heating-bath is partly filled with paraffin at a temperature of\r\nabout 120°. The paraffin-bath is raised so that the entire bulb of the\r\nflask is immersed therein and the distillation continued until all the\r\nliquid has been distilled. The bath is removed and after cooling\r\nsomewhat, ten cubic centimeters of methyl alcohol are introduced by\r\nmeans of the stoppered funnel-tube and the process of distillation\r\nrepeated. This operation with methyl alcohol is repeated five times. The\r\nboric acid passes off with the distillate and is found in the flask\r\nbelow the condenser as calcium borate. The contents of the distillation\r\nflask are evaporated to dryness and ignited conveniently in the same\r\ncrucible in which the lime was burned. The increase in weight represents\r\nthe quantity of boric anhydrid, B₂O₂ obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 92. GOOCH’S APPARATUS FOR BORIC ACID.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=519. Method Of Moissan.=—The principle of the method of Gooch, which\r\nhas just been described, is applied by Moissan in a slightly modified\r\nmanner.[345]\r\n\r\nIn this method the generating flask is made smaller than in the Gooch\r\napparatus, and the funnel at the top is oval and provided with a\r\nground-glass stopper. It is closed at the bottom with a glass stop-cock,\r\nand the slender funnel-tube enters through a rubber stopper and ends\r\nabout the middle of the bulb of the flask. The delivery-tube is longer\r\nthan in Fig. 91, and is bent upward at its middle part in the form of an\r\nobtuse angle. The receiving flask is connected with the condenser by\r\nmeans of a tube-shaped funnel, which prevents any regurgitation into the\r\ngenerating flask. The receiving flask also has attached to it a\r\nthree-bulb potash absorption tube, through which all vapors escaping\r\nfrom the receiving flask must pass. The bulbs contain a five per cent\r\nsolution of ammonia. The receiving flask should be placed in a\r\ncrystallizing dish and kept surrounded with ice-water.\r\n\r\nThe boron which is to be estimated should be in the form of boric acid.\r\nThis can readily be accomplished by treating the residue to be analyzed\r\nwith nitric acid in a sealed tube. The mixture is introduced into the\r\ngenerating flask, washing with a little nitric acid, and evaporated to\r\ndryness. The heat is removed, and, by means of the funnel, ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of methyl alcohol added, and distillation is renewed. This\r\noperation with methyl alcohol is repeated four times, taking care to\r\ndistill to dryness in each case before the addition of a fresh quantity\r\nof alcohol. Afterwards, there is introduced into the apparatus one cubic\r\ncentimeter each of distilled water and nitric acid and the distillation\r\nagain carried to dryness. The treatment with methyl alcohol, as\r\ndescribed above, is then repeated three times. To determine whether all\r\nthe boric acid have passed over, the receiving flask at the bottom of\r\nthe condenser is disconnected and a drop of the alcohol taken from the\r\nend of the condensing tube by means of a filament of filter paper. On\r\nburning, the flame should not show any trace of green. In case a green\r\ncolor is observed, the distillation with nitric acid and methyl alcohol\r\nmust be repeated.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia in the potash bulbs serves to arrest any of the vapors\r\ncarrying boric acid which might escape from the receiving flask. The\r\ncontents of the bulbs are to be mixed with the liquid in the receiving\r\ndish, and the whole poured onto a known weight of recently ignited\r\ncalcium oxid contained in a platinum dish, and the mixture briskly\r\nstirred. If the liquid be very acid the platinum dish should be kept in\r\nice-water to prevent heating. After fifteen minutes the liquid usually\r\nbecomes alkaline, and it is then evaporated at a temperature below the\r\nboiling-point of methyl alcohol (66°). The mass, after the methyl\r\nalcohol has disappeared, is dried at a gradually increasing temperature,\r\nand finally, the dish is ignited over a blast, at first covered and\r\nafterwards open. The dish is covered and weighed and again ignited until\r\nconstant weight is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe lime used should be specially prepared by igniting calcium nitrate\r\nincompletely, and reigniting a portion of this to constant weight just\r\nbefore beginning each analysis. The calcium oxid is then obtained in a\r\nperfectly fresh state. It should be employed in considerable excess, for\r\neach half gram of boric acid at least eight grams of the lime. The\r\noperation is tedious but the results are quite accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SPECIAL TREATMENT OF MUCK SOILS.\r\n\r\n=520. General Considerations.=—Deposits of muck which are to be used as\r\nsoil for cultural purposes, or marsh lands, containing large quantities\r\nof organic matter, require a special treatment in addition to the\r\ngeneral principles of examination illustrated in the previous pages.\r\nThese soils, essentially of an organic origin, do not permit of the same\r\ntreatment either chemical or physical as is practiced with soils of a\r\nmineral nature. For instance, it would be useless to attempt a silt\r\nanalysis with organic soils, and the extraction of them with\r\nhydrochloric acid for the purpose of determining the materials passing\r\ninto solution would prove of little utility. The object of the\r\nexamination is not only to obtain knowledge of the ultimate constitution\r\nof the sample, but also, and this is the practical point, to gain some\r\nidea of its stores of plant food and of the proper steps necessary to\r\nsecure a supply of the deficient nutrients. The final analytical\r\nprocesses for the estimation of the constituents of a muck or vegetable\r\nsoil are the same as those already given, but the preliminary treatment\r\nis radically different.\r\n\r\n=521. Sampling.=—First of all the geologic and meterologic conditions of\r\nthe muck formations must be determined as nearly as possible. It is fair\r\nto presume that these formations are of comparatively recent origin, in\r\nfact that they are still in progress. The geologic formation in the\r\nvicinity of the deposit should be noted. Information should be given in\r\nrespect of the character of the water, whether running or stagnant,\r\nfresh, salt, or brackish, and changes of level to which it is subject,\r\nshould be noted. It should be particularly stated whether the vegetable\r\ngrowth contributing to the formation be subject to frost or freezing.\r\nThe character of the growth is to be carefully noted, and observation\r\nmade of any changes in vegetation due to drainage preparatory to\r\ncultivation. It is to the original vegetation that the chief vegetable\r\naccretions in the muck must be accredited. In all cases, for purposes of\r\ncomparison, some samples must be taken from parts of the field which\r\nhave not been under cultivation or fertilization. The original\r\nproperties of the muck can thus be determined and compared with the\r\nportions which have been changed under cultivation. If the vegetation in\r\ndifferent parts of the field vary it is an indication that the muck is\r\nnot homogeneous, and in such cases all the different kinds must be\r\nseparately sampled. Any alluvial deposit should be carefully separated\r\nfrom the muck found _in situ_, for the two layers are radically\r\ndifferent in nature.\r\n\r\nThe sampling should be made by digging a pit, if possible to the bottom\r\nof the muck formation, and taking the samples at depths of one foot from\r\none or all of the sides. The samples from sections of even depth are to\r\nbe mixed and about five kilograms of the well-mixed sample preserved.\r\nBlocks of the unbroken and unshattered material should also be taken\r\nfrom each section for the purpose of determining permeability to water\r\nand air. All living vegetable matter should be as fully as possible\r\nremoved before the sampling begins. The nature of the subsoil must be\r\nobserved, and it should be stated whether it be sand, clay, limestone,\r\netc. Fresh samples should be taken at various depths for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the content of moisture in the manner described in paragraph\r\n=65=. The tubes used are made sharp at the end to be inserted in the\r\nsoil, and so arranged as to cut cylinders of soil a trifle smaller than\r\ntheir interior diameter. By this means the sample slips easily into its\r\nplace. The same care and judgment must be used in taking these samples\r\nas are required in the case of common soils.\r\n\r\n_Illustration._—Samples of muck soil taken at Runnymede, Florida.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Formation. Littoral fresh-water lacustrine deposits, varying from\r\na few inches to four feet in depth, and from a few feet to half a mile\r\nin width.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Vegetation before drainage. Saw grass (_Cladium Mariscus_ or\r\neffusum).\r\n\r\n(_c_) Principal present vegetation (see pages 59–60).\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Kinds of Soil._—The muck shows two distinct colors, black and\r\nbrown. The vegetation, however, seems to be the same in both cases. The\r\nblack muck has the appearance of being more thoroughly decomposed.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Geologic Formation._—This portion of the Florida peninsula is\r\ncovered generally with sand due to marine submergence during recent\r\ngeologic periods. The forest growth is pine. The drainage from the pine\r\nland is towards the muck deposits. The pine land lies from four to ten\r\nfeet higher than the surface of the muck and is much less subject to\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n=522. Water Content.=—The capacity of a muck soil for retaining water is\r\nvery great. In a moist state these soils are heavy and apparently quite\r\nfirm. When dry they are light and fluffy and unsuited to hold the\r\nrootlets of plants. Saturated to their greatest capacity they hold\r\nconsiderably more than their own weight of water. Attention has already\r\nbeen called to the danger of drying such samples at a high temperature.\r\nAs in most cases of drying exposure at the temperature of boiling water\r\nuntil a constant weight is obtained is a perfectly safe way. It is hard\r\nto say what comes off in addition to water at a higher temperature. All\r\nthat comes off even at the temperature of boiling water is not water.\r\n\r\nThe method of determination usually employed in this laboratory is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nFrom four to five grams of the material are spread as evenly as possible\r\nover the flat bottom of a circular aluminum dish, about seven\r\ncentimeters in diameter. The dish is exposed for three hours at the\r\ntemperature of boiling water and then kept for two hours in an air-bath\r\nat 110°. At the end of this time constant weight is obtained. Additional\r\ndrying at 110° for five hours, usually gives no further loss of volatile\r\nmatter. The dish should be covered during weighing on account of the\r\nhygroscopicity of the residue. When well sampled the dry matter thus\r\nobtained serves as the basis of calculation for the general analytical\r\ndata.\r\n\r\n_Results._—Samples of muck soil taken in brass tubes in March during the\r\ndry season had the following contents of moisture:\r\n\r\n                                    Matter volatile at 110°, per cent.\r\n Taken near the surface                                          61.60\r\n   „   one foot  below  the surface                              84.35\r\n   „   two feet    „     „     „                                 81.52\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the normal content of moisture in such a soil\r\nduring the dry season, exclusive of the top layer, is about eighty per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n=523. Organic Carbon and Hydrogen.=—The organic carbon and hydrogen in\r\nmuck soils are determined on the carefully dried sample by combustion\r\nwith copper oxid. This process gives not only the quantities of these\r\nbodies combined as humus, but also those in a less advanced state of\r\ndecomposition and present as fatty bodies or resins. The method employed\r\nis given on pages 319–20.\r\n\r\n_Results._—The data obtained on a sample of muck soil from Florida are\r\nas follow:\r\n\r\n                             Per cent. carbon. Per cent. hydrogen.\r\n     One   foot from surface             57.67                4.48\r\n     Two   feet  „      „                47.07                5.15\r\n     Three  „    „      „                 8.52                0.53\r\n\r\nThe last sample was largely mixed with sand, the muck at the point when\r\nit was taken not being quite three feet deep.\r\n\r\n=524. Total Volatile and Organic Matter and Ash.=—The ignition of the\r\nsample should be very carefully conducted at the lowest possible\r\ntemperature. About five grams of the air-dried sample or double that\r\namount of the moist sample should be taken. In the latter case the\r\ncalculations should be made on the basis of the dry material. The\r\nignition should be continued with frequent stirring with a platinum wire\r\nuntil all organic matter is destroyed. At the same time in a large dish\r\none or more kilograms of the sample should be ignited in order to secure\r\nan ash for analysis. The ash should be quickly weighed to avoid\r\nabsorption of moisture.\r\n\r\n=525. Sulfur.=—The sulfur present in muck is combined either in an\r\norganic form or with iron. It may be estimated by the method of\r\nFleischer.[346]\r\n\r\nFrom five to ten grams of the sample are ignited carefully in a hard\r\nglass tube in a stream of air or better of oxygen. The sulfur compounds\r\nescape as sulfuric or sulfurous acid.\r\n\r\nThe combustion is carried on in the apparatus shown in Fig. 93.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIGURE 93. APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING SULFUR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe end of the tube A, next to B, is lightly stopped with a plug of\r\nglass wool, the substance introduced and held in place by a second plug\r\nof glass wool next to C. A is connected to the working flask C,\r\ncontaining water, as is shown in the illustration. The chief object of\r\nthe flask is to control the rate of aspiration of the air or oxygen. A\r\nis also connected with the bulb-tube B, as shown in the figure. B\r\ncontains potash-lye, free of sulfur. On the top of B is placed a drying\r\ntube filled with glass pearls, moistened with potash-lye. This is\r\nconnected with the aspirator by a small bulb-tube bent at right angles,\r\nas indicated. The bulb of this tube contains a little neutral litmus\r\nsolution, which must suffer no change of color during the progress of\r\nthis analysis. The tube, thus arranged, is placed in a combustion\r\nfurnace and gradually heated to redness, beginning with the part next to\r\nB. A moderate stream of air or oxygen is passed through the tube during\r\nthe operation. Any product of the combustion collecting in the tube\r\nbefore reaching B, is driven into B by careful heating. At the end of\r\nthe combustion the contents of B are acidified with hydrochloric acid,\r\nand treated with bromin to convert the sulfurous into sulfuric acid. The\r\nexcess of bromin is afterwards removed by boiling, and the sulfuric acid\r\nprecipitated by barium chlorid and estimated in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe total sulfuric acid having thus been determined, the sample is\r\nextracted with water and the sulfuric acid estimated in the residue.\r\n\r\nThe sulfuric acid in a muck which is injurious to vegetation is\r\nclassified by Fleischer, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Free sulfuric acid. (The residue which is obtained by calculation as\r\nsulfates of the bases in the water extract.)\r\n\r\n(2) The sulfuric acid contained as copperas (calculated from the iron\r\noxid content of the aqueous extract).\r\n\r\n(3) Sulfuric acid arising from the oxidation of pyrites (calculated from\r\nthe sulfuric acid obtained by treatment of the water-extracted sample).\r\n\r\nA better idea of the distribution of the sulfur in the sample can be\r\nobtained by estimating it according to the method given in paragraph\r\n=385=.\r\n\r\n=526. Phosphoric Acid.=—The method for determining the phosphorus in\r\nmuck is given in paragraph =382=. The process given in =378= may also be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe method of extraction with hydrochloric acid is wholly unreliable as\r\na means of determining the available phosphoric acid in muck.\r\n\r\nThere are some vegetable soils which contain so much iron and lime that\r\nthe whole of the acid ordinarily used would be consumed thereby. This\r\nfact has been clearly pointed out by Wiklund in determining the\r\nphosphoric acid in a large number of peaty soils.[347] His experiments,\r\nwere made with acid of only four per cent strength. In some cases,\r\nhowever, it may be found useful to determine the quantity of phosphoric\r\nacid which can be extracted with hydrochloric acid, and afterwards to\r\nseparate the humus and determine the content of phosphoric acid therein.\r\n\r\n=527. Humus.=—In this laboratory the humus is estimated by the method of\r\nHuston and McBride, as given in paragraph =312=. In samples so rich in\r\norganic matter the method of Grandeau does not give as good results.\r\n\r\nOften more than half the weight of the dry substance is soluble in\r\nammonia after treatment with acid. The nitrogen in the original sample\r\nand the separated humus should be estimated by moist combustion with\r\nsulfuric acid in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n=528. The Mineral Contents of Humus.=—The material obtained by\r\nprecipitating the alkaline extract of a vegetable earth with an acid\r\ndoes not consist alone of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. The\r\ncomplex molecules which make up this mixture contain certain quantities\r\nof iron, sulfur, and phosphorus in an organic state. These bodies are\r\nleft as inorganic compounds on ignition, provided there is enough of\r\nbase present to combine with all the acid elements. Much of the sulfur\r\nand phosphorus, however, in these compounds might be lost by simple\r\nignition. In such cases moist oxidation of these bodies must be\r\npracticed, or the gases of combustion passed over bodies capable of\r\nabsorbing the oxidized materials in order to detect and determine them.\r\nThe proper methods of accomplishing this have already been pointed out\r\nfor vegetable soils, and the same processes are applicable in the case\r\nof extracted and precipitated humus.\r\n\r\nAnother proof that both phosphorus and sulfur are present in humus in an\r\norganic state is found in the fact pointed out by Eggertz and Nilson,\r\nthat the ash of muck soils is always richer in sulfuric and phosphoric\r\nacids than the solution obtained therefrom by hydrochloric acid.[348]\r\n\r\nIn a sample of muck examined by them there was found in the ash 1.46 per\r\ncent SO₃, and in the acid extract only 0.05 per cent SO₃; and in the ash\r\n0.3 per cent P₂O₅, while in the extract only 0.04 per cent P₂O₅.\r\n\r\n=529. Combustion of the Humus.=—The percentage composition of the\r\nextracted humus can be determined, after drying to constant weight, by\r\ncombustion with copper oxid. There is little use in trying to assign\r\ndefinite chemical formulas to any of the components of the complex which\r\nwe call humus. Some of the supposed formulas have been given on pages 61\r\nand 62.\r\n\r\n=530. Ether Extract.=—Most peaty soils, when very dry, are not easily\r\nmoistened with water. This is due to a superficial coating of fatty or\r\nresinous bodies which prevents the water from reaching the muck\r\nparticles. In such cases water will pass between the particles and\r\npercolate to a considerable depth, but without wetting. This oily matter\r\ncan be removed by treating the dry material with ether in any approved\r\nextraction apparatus. For the separation of the more purely fatty\r\nbodies, light petroleum may be used, while the total of such matters is\r\nextractable with sulfuric ether. The extracted bodies should be examined\r\nto determine their nature, whether fatty, resinous, or of other\r\nmaterials soluble in ether. The quantity of this material in some muck\r\nsoils is remarkably high. In a Florida muck, examined in this\r\nlaboratory, 18.95 per cent in the air-dried substance, which contained\r\nstill 41.83 per cent of water, or about 32.5 per cent of the water-free\r\nmaterial were found to be soluble in ether.\r\n\r\nThe color of the ether extract may be almost black, showing the\r\nextraction of a part of the humus or coloring matter in the muck. This\r\nextractive coloring matter may also be a partial oxidation product of\r\nthe original chlorophyl of the plant.\r\n\r\n=531. Further Examination of the Ether Extract.=—The ether extract\r\nshould be first treated with petroleum ether, unless this substance be\r\nused first in extraction. Afterwards, it is to be exhausted with strong\r\nalcohol, and the quantities of material soluble in the three reagents\r\nseparately determined.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen is further to be determined in the several extracts, and,\r\nfor control, in the residue of the muck.\r\n\r\nThe method of procedure practiced in this laboratory is to first extract\r\nthe sample with petroleum ether, which will yield any free fat acids,\r\nfats, or oils, waxes, and possibly some resinous matter. A weighed\r\nportion of the sample, about two grams, is extracted quantitively by one\r\nof the methods which will be described in the second volume of this\r\nmanual.\r\n\r\nFrom two to five kilograms of the sample are then extracted in bulk for\r\nthe purpose of securing a sufficient quantity of the material to use for\r\nfurther analysis.[349]\r\n\r\nIn each case the petroleum is followed by pure ether, and in this way\r\nthe chlorophyl, resins, etc., are obtained. This extract is examined\r\nalso for its several proximate constituents.[350]\r\n\r\nThe treatment with ether is followed by extraction with absolute alcohol\r\nfor the removal of tannins and other glucosides, resins insoluble in\r\nether, etc., and the extract subjected to the usual examination.[351]\r\nInstead of absolute alcohol a spirit of ninety-five per cent strength,\r\nor even of eighty per cent, may be used. The final residue should be\r\nsubjected to the usual determination for nitrogen, volatile matter, ash,\r\netc., in the manner already described. The large amount of resinous and\r\nother matters soluble in petroleum and ether, which is found in the\r\nFlorida muck soils, is probably due to the proximity of pine forests,\r\nthe débris of which, sooner or later, find their way to these littoral\r\ndeposits. Considerable portions of organic humic acids and even humus\r\nitself, may also be removed by ether and alcohol and in every case\r\nnitrogen should be determined in these extracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      RARE CONSTITUENTS OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n=532. Estimation of Copper.=—The natural occurrence of copper in many\r\nvegetables has acquired additional significance by reason of its\r\nrelation to added copper in canned peas and other preserves. Formerly,\r\ncopper was not regarded, in any sense, as a plant food. Even now it can\r\nscarcely be considered as more than an accidental and non-essential\r\nconstituent of vegetable matter. It is by no means certain, however,\r\nthat copper may not be, in some sense, in organic combination, as\r\nphosphorus and sulfur often are. It is said, also, to be found in\r\ncertain animal organisms, notably in the oyster. In the estimation of\r\ncopper in soils, there is first made a hydrochloric acid solution of the\r\nsample. The solution is treated with well-washed hydrogen sulfid until\r\nwell saturated. The precipitate is collected at once on a gooch, and\r\nwashed with water containing the precipitating reagent. The filtrate is\r\ndried, gently ignited or roasted, and dissolved in aqua regia. After\r\nevaporating to dryness on a steam-bath, water and hydrochloric acid are\r\nadded, and the copper reprecipitated in the manner described above.\r\n\r\nIf zinc be present in the sample the solution should be made very\r\nstrongly acid with hydrochloric before the treatment with hydrogen\r\nsulfid, otherwise some zinc may be carried down with the copper.[352] If\r\nlead be present it is also precipitated with the copper and can be\r\nseparated as described below. In the filtrate from the solution in\r\nnitric acid after the second precipitation the copper is precipitated as\r\nhydroxid by potash, collected in a porcelain gooch, dried, ignited, and\r\nweighed as CuO. Or the copper may be secured as sulfate and estimated\r\nelectrolytically in the manner described in volume second for the\r\ngravimetric estimation of sugar.\r\n\r\n=533. Estimation of Lead.=—If the soil contain lead this metal will be\r\nthrown down with the copper as sulfid in the manner described above. In\r\nthis case the mixed sulfids are dissolved in nitric acid, diluted with\r\nwater, filtered, and washed. The filtrate is treated with sulfuric acid\r\nin considerable excess, and evaporated until all the nitric acid has\r\npassed off and the sulfuric acid begins to escape. After cooling, water\r\nis added and the lead sulfate collected on a porcelain gooch and washed\r\nwith water containing sulfuric acid. Finally it is washed with alcohol,\r\ndried, ignited, and the lead weighed as PbSO₄.\r\n\r\n=534. Estimation of Zinc.=—If zinc be present in the hydrochloric acid\r\nextract of a soil it may be estimated as carbonate after freeing it\r\ncarefully of iron. The principal part of the iron should first be\r\nseparated in the usual way by sodium acetate. In the warm solution (acid\r\nwith acetic) the zinc is precipitated by hydrogen sulfid in excess. The\r\nbeaker in which the precipitation takes place should be left covered in\r\na warm place at least twelve hours. After collecting the zinc sulfid on\r\na filter it is washed with water saturated with hydrogen sulfid. In\r\norder to free the zinc from every trace of iron it is better to dissolve\r\nthe precipitate in hot dilute hydrochloric acid and reprecipitate as\r\nabove, and, after boiling with some potassium chlorate, saturate it with\r\nammonia. Any remaining trace of iron is precipitated as ferric hydroxid\r\nwhile the zinc remains in solution. The ferric hydroxid is separated by\r\nfiltration and the filtrate, after acidifying with acetic, is treated\r\nwith hydrogen sulfid as above. The zinc sulfid is dissolved again in hot\r\nhydrochloric acid, oxidized with potassium chlorate, the acid almost\r\nneutralized with soda and the zinc precipitated as carbonate with the\r\nsodium salt. After precipitation, the contents of the beaker are boiled\r\nuntil all free carbon dioxid is expelled, the carbonate collected on a\r\nfilter, washed with hot water, dried, ignited, and weighed as ZnO.\r\n\r\n=535. Estimation of Boron.=—Boron has been found in the ashes of many\r\nplants and agricultural products. Whether or not it be an essential or\r\nonly accidental constituent of plants has not been determined. Its\r\noccurrence in the soil, nevertheless, is a matter which the agricultural\r\nchemist can not overlook. The boron should be dissolved from the soil by\r\ngently heating with dilute nitric acid followed by washing with hot\r\nwater. Boiling should be avoided on account of the volatility of boric\r\nacid. In the solution thus obtained, concentrated on a bath at a\r\nmoderate temperature to a convenient volume, the boron is to be\r\nestimated by the method given in paragraphs =518= and =519=.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   AUTHORITIES CITED IN PART EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  Bulletin 13, Chemical Division, Department of Agriculture, p. 1021.\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n
