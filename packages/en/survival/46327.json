Y., _January 12, 1915_\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable Board of Control of the New York Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation_:\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript copy\r\nfor Part II of the 33d Annual Report of this Station. This contribution\r\nis the fourth monograph on the fruits of New York State, prepared under\r\nyour direction by the Horticulturist of this institution and his\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nThe cherry, which this manuscript discusses, is undoubtedly most widely\r\ngrown of the tree-fruits of the State; for within easy reach of every\r\nrural housewife--in orchard or garden, along roadside or lane--the \"pie\r\ncherry\" will be found; and many a lawn, even in village or city, is\r\ngraced by the stately trees which bear the delicious Yellow Spanish or\r\nBlack Tartarian. In many parts of the State, also, cherry growing is an\r\nindustry of much commercial importance, with orchards exceeded in value\r\nby those of the apple and peach alone.\r\n\r\nBecause of its widespread popularity and commercial importance the\r\ncherry well merits treatment in this place in the series of monographs.\r\nIt is hoped and believed that the growers and lovers of the fruit will\r\nappreciate and utilize to good advantage the result here presented of\r\nyears of painstaking work by the authors. The discussions are based not\r\nalone on Station experience with hundreds of the thousand or more\r\nvarieties described, but as well upon the collected observations of many\r\ncherry growers and the expressed judgments of the leading pomologists\r\nwho have been interested in this fruit.\r\n\r\n  W. H. JORDAN,\r\n\r\n  _Director_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth of the monographs on the fruits of temperate North\r\nAmerica published by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station. The\r\nnature and purposes of these treatises have been set forth in the\r\nprefaces of preceding volumes, but a summary of the purposes, with\r\nneeded emphasis on several, is given for the convenience of all readers\r\nand the enlightenment of those who may not have the first three books.\r\n\r\n_The Cherries of New York_ contains an historical account of cultivated\r\ncherries, the botany of this fruit, a statement of its present economic\r\nstatus in America, descriptions of all known varieties of cherries, the\r\nsynonymy and bibliography of the species and varieties, and biographical\r\nsketches of the persons who have contributed materially to cherry\r\nculture in America. The most important varieties are illustrated in\r\ncolors. Everything that was thought would be helpful in breeding\r\ncherries has been included, and special search has been made for such\r\nmaterial. So, too, whatever was thought to be of interest to students of\r\necology and of plant distribution has been added.\r\n\r\nIn the monographs on grapes and plums it was necessary to devote much\r\nspace to the botanical relationship of these fruits since each contains\r\nmore than a score of species under cultivation, some of which are\r\nscarcely known and most of which are extremely variable. The botany of\r\ncultivated cherries is comparatively simple and has been made plain by\r\nbotanical writers. Yet the contemplation of the several species from a\r\nhorticultural standpoint adds something, we believe, to the botany of\r\ncherries, especially as concerns the forms of the Sweet Cherry and the\r\nSour Cherry which have been variously treated by botanists.\r\n\r\nAs compared with their congeners, especially the plums, the economic\r\nspecies of cherries are remarkably well delimited, showing far less\r\nresponsiveness to environment and having seemingly less inherent\r\nvariation, so that there need be little confusion in botanical\r\nclassification. On the other hand varieties are so similar that it is\r\nonly with the greatest difficulty that closely related sorts are\r\ndistinguished and there is great confusion in the synonymy, the chief\r\ntask of the present work being to distinguish the true names from the\r\nsynonyms of the varieties described.\r\n\r\nIn _The Cherries of New York_, as in the preceding fruit books from\r\nthis Station, effort has been made to give as accurately as possible\r\nthe region in which the species and varieties grow best and to set forth\r\nfully the local prejudices of the fruits. Such knowledge cannot but be\r\nof value in determining the factors which govern the distribution of\r\nplants. The establishment of community relationships and description of\r\nplant communities now constitute an important part of botany on the one\r\nside and of geography on the other. No phenomena give better expression\r\nof the climate and the soil of a region than plant communities. When\r\nmonographs of several of the fruits of temperate North America shall\r\nhave been completed, with statements of likes and dislikes of the fruits\r\nand their varieties as to climate and soil, material should be available\r\nto establish plant communities from which can be drawn valuable\r\ngeneralizations.\r\n\r\nAll, howsoever interested in pomology, are dependent upon descriptions\r\nof fruits. A well-made description of a fruit, to one mentally equipped\r\nto interpret it, is second only, in the study of pomology, to having the\r\nfruit itself. With but few exceptions the descriptions of the major\r\nvarieties are made first hand from cherries growing on the Station\r\ngrounds, though in many cases fruits from different localities have been\r\ncompared with those home-grown.\r\n\r\nSince there are fewer varieties of cherries than of plums, it has been\r\npossible to describe and illustrate a greater proportion of the sorts\r\nunder cultivation than in the book on plums, yet a selection has had to\r\nbe made of the worthiest of the many kinds. The choice of sorts for full\r\ndescriptions and color-plates has been determined: (1) By the present\r\nvalue of the variety; (2) the probable value if the variety be a\r\nnovelty; (3) by the value of the data to the cherry breeder; (4) because\r\nof historical value--to show what the trend of cherry evolution has\r\nbeen; (5) to show the relationships of species and varieties. The\r\nvarieties not illustrated nor fully described are divided into two\r\nfurther groups in accordance with the same considerations.\r\n\r\nIn botanical nomenclature the code adopted by the International\r\nBotanical Congress, held at Vienna in 1905, has been used. In the use of\r\nhorticultural names we have followed somewhat closely the rules of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society, though in many cases strict observance of\r\nthese rules, poor at best, would have added to rather than lessened the\r\nconfusion in horticultural nomenclature and, therefore, they have been\r\nhonored in the breach rather than in the observance.\r\n\r\nThe references given are those that have been of use in ascertaining the\r\nhistory, the economic status, or the description of the variety that\r\nfollows--no more, no fewer. These constitute a very small proportion of\r\nthe references that have been read--a tremendous task involving two or\r\nthree years' work for several persons.\r\n\r\nSo, too, it has been a herculean task to search out the synonyms of\r\ncherries. French, German, English and American books on pomology\r\noverflow with such synonyms and all in a state of \"confusion worse\r\nconfounded.\" An enormous amount of work has been done in trying to bring\r\norder out of this confusion. Many of the synonyms of varieties have been\r\ngiven in times past because of adaptations to local environment. Such\r\nnaming of ecologic forms is not an unmixed evil, since it draws\r\nattention to variable varieties and characters which otherwise might be\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nUnder the ferment of Mendelian and De Vriesian ideas we seem to be at\r\nthe beginning of an era of great improvement of plants. There have never\r\nbeen well-directed efforts to improve fruits, yet something has been\r\ndone with all. Now, when there is an onrush of new discoveries in\r\nplant-breeding, seems to be a particularly opportune time to tell all\r\nthat can be learned about how cherries have been brought from their wild\r\nstate to their present perfection. This we try to do in giving the\r\norigin and history of varieties, especially as to parentage and manner\r\nof origin, though such information is scant and very fragmentary.\r\n\r\nAs in the previous fruit books some prominence is given in foot-notes to\r\nbiography. A knowledge of the career of those who have been giants in\r\ntheir day in the development of any industry is most helpful to the best\r\nunderstanding, indeed, is almost indispensable to the fullest\r\ncomprehension, of the industry. The short foot-notes, it is hoped, will\r\nserve to give some conception of what the master builders in pomology\r\nwere like in training, character, and methods of work. From the\r\nreception which these sketches in former fruit books have received, the\r\nwriters feel that the considerable expenditure of time and thought that\r\nthese biographical notices have required is amply justified and that the\r\neffort to give credit due and some small honor to the promoters of\r\npomology has been well worth while.\r\n\r\nFor aid in the preparation of _The Cherries of New York_ I am especially\r\nindebted to those whose names appear on the title page, to my associate,\r\nMr. R. D. Anthony, for reading proof; to the Station editor, Mr. F. H.\r\nHall, who has had charge of the proof reading; to Zeese-Wilkinson\r\nCompany, New York City, who have had an especially difficult task in\r\nmaking the color-plates and who have done the work well; and to the J.\r\nB. Lyon Company, Albany, New York, for their painstaking work in\r\nprinting the book.\r\n\r\n  U. P.

KINDRED\r\n\r\nThe genus Prunus plays a very important part in horticulture. It\r\nfurnishes, in temperate climates, the stone-fruits, plants of ancient\r\nand modern agriculture of which there are a score or more commonly\r\ncultivated and at least as many more sparingly grown for their edible\r\nfruits. Of these stone-fruits the species of cherries rank with those of\r\nthe plum and the peach in commercial importance while the several\r\nbotanical groups of the apricot and almond are less important, but\r\nhardly less well-known, members of this notable genus. Prunus is of\r\ninterest, too, because the history of its edible species follows step by\r\nstep the history of agriculture. The domestication of its fruits from\r\nwild progenitors, most of which are still subjects of common\r\nobservation, illustrates well the influences and conditions under which\r\nplants have generally been brought into domestication. The genus is also\r\nof more than ordinary note because the number of its economic species is\r\nbeing increased almost yearly by new-found treasures from North America\r\nand Asia, not varieties but species, which promise under future\r\ndomestication still further to enrich horticulture.\r\n\r\nThe plum and the peach surpass the cherry in diversity of flavor, aroma,\r\ntexture, color, form and size, characters which make fruits pleasant to\r\nthe palate and beautiful to the eye; but the cherry, perhaps, plays a\r\nmore important part than the plum or the peach in domestic economy. It\r\nhas fewer prejudices as to soil and climate, hence is much more widely\r\ndistributed and is more easily grown, being better represented in the\r\norchards and gardens in the regions where the three fruits grow. The\r\ncherry, too, fruits more quickly after planting, ripens earlier in the\r\nseason and its varieties are more regular in bearing and usually more\r\nfruitful--characters that greatly commend it to fruit-growing people.\r\nProbably it is the most popular of all fruits for the garden, dooryard,\r\nroadside and small orchard. All in all, while adorning a somewhat\r\nhumbler place in pomology, it is more generally useful than the showier\r\nand more delicate plum and peach.\r\n\r\nThough placed by most botanists in the same genus, each of the\r\nstone-fruits constitutes a natural group so distinct that neither\r\nbotanist nor fruit-grower could possibly take one for another as the\r\ntrees and fruits of the different groups are called to mind. But there\r\nare outstanding forms which seem to establish connections between the\r\nmany species and the several groups of fruits and through these\r\noutliers the characters are so confounded in attempting to separate\r\nspecies that it becomes quickly apparent that there are few distinct\r\nlines of cleavage within the genus. For several centuries systematists\r\nhave disputed as to whether the stone-fruits fall most naturally into\r\none, two, or three genera--indeed have not been able to agree as to\r\nwhether some species are plums or cherries, or others apricots or\r\nplums. Hybridization between the cultivated divisions of the\r\ngenus--unquestionably it has taken place in nature as well--has added\r\nto the perplexities of classification. Accepting, then, for the\r\npresent at least, the very artificial classification which, rather\r\nparadoxically, places in one genus a number of fruits commonly thought\r\nof as quite distinct, let us briefly note the characters which best\r\ndistinguish cherries from their congeners.\r\n\r\nThe cherry is nearest of kin to the plum. These two are roughly\r\nseparated from the other cultivated members of the genus to which they\r\nbelong by bearing their fruits on stems in fascicles while the others\r\nare practically stemless and are solitary or borne in pairs. The fruits\r\nof plums and cherries are globular or oblong, succulent and smooth or\r\nnearly so. Peaches, apricots, nectarines and almonds are more sulcate\r\nthan plums and cherries and the almond has a drier flesh, splitting at\r\nmaturity to liberate the stone; and, with the exception of nectarines\r\nand a few varieties of apricots, all are very pubescent. The stones of\r\ncherries and plums are smooth, or nearly so, while those of the other\r\nfruits are sculptured and pitted, though those of the apricot are often\r\nsomewhat plum-like.\r\n\r\nCherries are separated from plums by their smaller size and distinctive\r\ncolor of skin, juice and flesh; by the texture and distinct flavor of\r\nthe flesh; by growth in corymbose rather than umbelliferous fascicles;\r\nby the more globular stone; and by the arrangement of the leaves in the\r\nbud. Leaves of the plum are usually convolute, or rolled up, in the bud,\r\nwhile those of the cherry are conduplicate, or folded lengthwise along\r\nthe midrib.\r\n\r\nWe have been discussing the cherries of common cultivation--the Sweet\r\nCherry and Sour Cherry of the orchards, the fascicled cherries to which\r\nthe botanists give the group name, Cerasus. But there is another group,\r\nthe Padus cherries, well worthy of brief mention. The most noteworthy\r\nrepresentatives of Padus are the bird cherry (_Prunus padus_) of the Old\r\nWorld and the choke cherry (_Prunus virginiana_) of the New World. These\r\nPadus cherries are distinguished botanically in having their flowers\r\nborne in racemes, that is, in long clusters of which those nearest the\r\nbase of the shoot open first--rather than in the short-clustered\r\nfascicles of the Cerasus group. The cherries are small and almost or\r\nquite black. The Padus cherries are but sparingly cultivated but\r\nundoubtedly they are capable of some improvement under more thorough\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF CULTIVATED CHERRIES\r\n\r\nThe cherry is one of the most commonly cultivated of all fruits and the\r\nmany varieties of its several forms encircle the globe in the North\r\nTemperate Zone and are being rapidly disseminated throughout the\r\ntemperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere. For centuries it has been,\r\nas we shall see in the history of the species, one of the most valuable\r\nfruit-producing trees of Europe and Asia--an inhabitant of nearly every\r\norchard and garden as well as a common roadside tree in temperate\r\nclimates in both continents. From Europe, as a center of distribution,\r\nthe cherry has played an important part in the orcharding in temperate\r\nregions of other continents. In North America varieties of the cherry\r\nare grown from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island on the north, to the\r\nGulf of California, Texas and Florida on the south, yielding fruit in a\r\ngreater diversity of soils and climates in Canada and the States of the\r\nUnion than any other tree-fruit.\r\n\r\nThe Sour Cherry is very cosmopolitan, thriving in many soils; is able to\r\nwithstand heat, cold and great atmospheric dryness, if the soil contain\r\nmoisture; and, though it responds to good care, it grows under neglect\r\nbetter than any other tree-fruit. The Sour Cherry, too, is rather less\r\ninviting to insects and fungi than most other stone-fruits, being\r\npractically immune to the dreaded San José scale. On the other hand the\r\nSweet Cherry is very fastidious as to soils, is lacking in hardiness to\r\nboth heat and cold and is prey to many insects and subject to all the\r\nills to which stone-fruits are heir; it is grown at its best in but few\r\nand comparatively limited areas, though these are very widely\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF THE CHERRY\r\n\r\nThe cherry is a delectable early-summer fruit, especially grateful\r\nas a refreshing dessert and much valued in cookery, when fresh,\r\ncanned, preserved or dried, for the making of pies, tarts, sauces\r\nand confections. During the last few years, in America at least, the\r\nconsumption of cherries has been enormously increased by the fashion\r\nof adding preserved cherries, as much for ornament as to give flavor,\r\nto many drinks and ices. The great bulk of the cherry crop now grown\r\nin America for commercial purposes is canned, the industry being more\r\nor less specialized in a few fruit regions. The demand for cherries\r\nfor canning seems to be increasing greatly but unfortunately it calls\r\nfor but few varieties, the Montmorency being the sort sought for among\r\nthe Sour Cherries, while the hard-fleshed varieties of the Bigarreau\r\ntype are in greatest demand among the Sweet Cherries.\r\n\r\nThe cherry, while a very common fruit in nearly all agricultural\r\nregions of America, does not hold the place in American markets as\r\na fresh fruit that it does in the towns and cities of Europe. The\r\ngreat abundance of strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries,\r\ndewberries, blackberries, as well as early varieties of tree fruits,\r\nmakes keener here than abroad the competition in the fruit markets\r\nduring cherry time. The fact, too, that market fruits in America\r\nare shipped long distances, for which the cherry is not well\r\nadapted, helps to explain the relatively small regard in which this\r\nfruit has been held for commercial purposes in the fresh state. In\r\nrecent years, however, both Sweet Cherries and Sour Cherries, the\r\nformer in particular, have been sent to the markets in far greater\r\nabundance, the impetus to their market value being due to a better\r\nproduct--better varieties, hence greater demand--and to greatly\r\nimproved facilities for shipping and holding for sale.\r\n\r\nIn Europe several liqueurs are very commonly made from cherries both\r\nfor home and commercial uses. Such is not the case in America, where,\r\nexcept in very limited quantities in which unfermented cherry juices\r\nare used in the home, this fruit is not used in liqueur-making. In\r\nsome of the countries of Europe, wine is made from the juice; a\r\nspirit, kirschwasser,[1] is distilled from the fermented pulp as an\r\narticle for both home and commerce; and ratafias and cordials are\r\nvery generally flavored with cherries. In the Austrian province of\r\nDalmatia a liqueur or cordial called maraschino[2] is made by a secret\r\nprocess of fermentation and distillation. This liqueur is imported in\r\nAmerica in considerable quantities to flavor preservatives in which\r\nthe home-grown cherries are prepared for use in various drinks and\r\nconfections. No attempts have been made to grow the Marasca cherry\r\non a commercial scale in America but undoubtedly it could be grown\r\nand, with the process of making maraschino discovered, an important\r\nuse would be developed for cherries--all the more to be desired since\r\nthe foreign maraschino is now grossly adulterated and imitated in\r\nthis country. Both the fruits and seeds of cherries, especially of\r\nthe Mahaleb, are steeped in spirits for food, drink and medicinal\r\npurposes. An oil used in making perfumes for scenting soaps and\r\nconfectionery is also extracted from the seeds of the Mahaleb because\r\nof which use this species is often called the \"Perfumed Cherry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old herbals and pomologies much is made of the value of\r\ncherries for medicinal purposes. The fruit was supposed to be a\r\nsovereign remedy for various ailments of the digestive tract as\r\nwell as for nervous disorders and epilepsy. The astringent leaves\r\nand bark, or extracts from them, were much used by the ancients in\r\nmedicine and are still more or less employed both as home remedies\r\nand in the practice of medicine as mild tonics and sedatives. One of\r\nthe active chemicals of the leaf, seed and bark is hydrocyanic acid\r\nto which is largely due the peculiar odor of these structures. A gum\r\nis secreted from the trunks of cherry trees, known in commerce as\r\ncerasin, which has some use in medicine and in various trades as well,\r\nespecially as a substitute and as an adulterant of gum arabic.\r\n\r\nAt least three cultivated cherry trees produce wood of considerable\r\nvalue. The wood of the cherry is hard, close-grained, solid, durable,\r\na handsome pale red, or brown tinged with red. _Prunus avium_, the\r\nSweet Cherry, furnishes a wood which, if sufficient care be taken to\r\nseason it, is of much value in cabinet-making and for the manufacture\r\nof musical instruments. _Prunus mahaleb_ is a much smaller tree than\r\nthe former but its wood, as much as there is of it, is even more\r\nvaluable, being very hard and fragrant and dark enough in color to\r\ntake on a beautiful mahogany-like polish. In France the wood of\r\nthe Mahaleb cherry is held in high esteem, under the name _Bois\r\nde St. Lucie_, in cabinet-making and for toys, canes, handles and\r\nespecially for the making of tobacco pipes. In Japan the wood of\r\n_Prunus pseudocerasus_ is said to be in great demand for engraving\r\nand in making the blocks used in printing cloth and wall-paper. In\r\nAmerica the wood of the orchard species of cherries is seldom used for\r\ndomestic purposes, that of the wild species being so much more cheaply\r\nobtainable and serving all purposes quite as well.\r\n\r\nTo people who know it only for its fruit, the cherry does not appear\r\nparticularly desirable as an ornamental. But wild and cultivated\r\ncherries furnish many beautiful trees in a genus peculiar for the\r\nbeauty of its species. The color and abundance of the flowers, fruits\r\nand leaves of the cultivated cherries and the fact that they are\r\nprolific of forms with double flowers, weeping, fastigiate or other\r\nornamental habits, make the several species of this plant valuable as\r\nornamentals. Besides, they are vigorous and rapid in growth, hardy,\r\neasy of culture, comparatively free from pests and adapted to a great\r\ndiversity of soils and climates. Both the ornamental and the edible\r\ncherries are very beautiful in spring when abundantly covered with\r\nflowers, which usually open with the unfolding leaves, as well as\r\nthroughout the summer when overspread with lustrous green foliage and\r\nmost of them are quite as conspicuously beautiful in the autumn when\r\nthe leaves turn from green to light and dark tints of red. All will\r\nagree that a cherry tree in full fruit is a most beautiful object. In\r\nthe winter when the leaves have fallen, some of the trees, especially\r\nof the ornamental varieties, are very graceful and beautiful, others\r\nare often picturesque, and even the somewhat stiff and formal Sweet\r\nCherries are attractive plants in the garden or along the roadside.\r\n\r\nVery acceptable jellies, sauces and preserves are made from several\r\nof the wild cherries in the Padus group. The peasantry of the Eastern\r\nHemisphere have in times of need found them important foods as have\r\nalso the American Indians at all times. The fruits of some of the\r\nspecies of Padus are quite commonly used in flavoring liqueurs and on\r\nboth continents are sometimes fermented and distilled into a liqueur\r\nsimilar to kirschwasser. The bark of different parts of the trees of\r\nthis group is valuable in medicine--at least is largely used. The\r\ntrees of several species form handsome ornamentals and some of them\r\nare in commerce for the purpose. _Prunus serotina_, one of the group,\r\nbecause of the strength of its wood and the beautiful satiny polish\r\nwhich its surface is capable of receiving, is a valuable timber tree\r\nof American forests. For the products of the members of this group,\r\nas just set forth, the domestication of some of the species of Padus\r\nmight well be pushed.\r\n\r\n    [1] Kirschwasser as a commercial article is made chiefly on the\r\n    upper Rhine from the wild black Sweet Cherry (_Prunus avium_). In\r\n    its manufacture, fruit--flesh and kernels--is mashed into a pulp\r\n    which is allowed to ferment. By distillation from this fermented\r\n    pulp a colorless liqueur is obtained.\r\n\r\n    [2] Maraschino is a liqueur, or cordial, made from the fruit and\r\n    leaves of the small, sour, black Marasca cherry. The product\r\n    comes chiefly from Zara, the capital of the Austrian province\r\n    of Dalmatia, where it has been made and exported for over 200\r\n    years. Such accounts of the process of making maraschino as have\r\n    become public seem to agree that the liqueur is a distillation\r\n    of a compote made from the fruit and young leaves. When ripe\r\n    the cherries are picked early in the morning and sent at once\r\n    to the distillery where the stones are extracted by machinery.\r\n    The leaves are cut, pressed and added to the fruit with sugar\r\n    and alcohol. This mixture is allowed to ferment for six months\r\n    or thereabouts and from it is then distilled maraschino. It is\r\n    then stored in cellars for three years before being placed on the\r\n    markets. In both Europe and America there are many imitations of\r\n    the maraschino liqueur in which neither fruit nor foliage of the\r\n    Marasca nor any other cherry has any part.\r\n\r\n    According to the Dalmatians all attempts to improve the Marasca\r\n    cherry by culture have failed. They say, too, that it will not\r\n    thrive elsewhere than in Dalmatia. Under culture, the fruits and\r\n    leaves lose their distinctive aroma and taste as they do on any\r\n    but the native soil of the variety. The poorer, sparser and more\r\n    rocky the ferruginous soil, the wilder the tree, the smaller and\r\n    sourer the cherries, the better the maraschino liqueur--so the\r\n    present makers say.\r\n\r\n    Since considerable quantities of cherries are put up in America\r\n    in maraschino, or its imitation, and the manufacture of such\r\n    products is a growing industry, the following ruling by the Board\r\n    of Food and Drug Inspection of the United States Department of\r\n    Agriculture, taken from Food Inspection Decision 141, is of\r\n    interest to growers, canners and users of cherries:\r\n\r\n    \"In considering the products prepared from the large light-colored\r\n    cherry of the Napoleon Bigarreau, or Royal Anne type, which\r\n    are artificially colored and flavored and put up in a sugar\r\n    sirup, flavored with various materials, the Board has reached\r\n    the conclusion that this product is not properly entitled to be\r\n    called 'Maraschino Cherries,' or 'Cherries in Maraschino.' If,\r\n    however, these cherries are packed in a sirup, flavored with\r\n    maraschino alone, it is the opinion of the Board that they would\r\n    not be misbranded, if labeled 'Cherries, Maraschino Flavor,' or\r\n    'Maraschino Flavored Cherries.' If these cherries are packed in\r\n    maraschino liqueur there would be no objection to the phrase\r\n    'Cherries in Maraschino.' When these artificially colored cherries\r\n    are put up in a sirup flavored in imitation of maraschino, even\r\n    though the flavoring may consist in part of maraschino, it would\r\n    not be proper to use the word 'Maraschino' in connection with\r\n    the product unless preceded by the word 'Imitation.' They may,\r\n    however, be labeled to show that they are a preserved cherry,\r\n    artificially colored and flavored.\r\n\r\n    \"The presence of artificial coloring or flavoring matter, of any\r\n    substitute for cane sugar, and the presence and amount of benzoate\r\n    of soda, when used in these products must be plainly stated upon\r\n    the label in the manner provided in Food Inspection Decisions Nos.\r\n    52 and 104.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE CHERRY\r\n\r\nDespite the important part they have played in orcharding since the\r\ndomestication of fruits in temperate zones, as shown by their history\r\nand their present popularity, pomological writers have singularly\r\nneglected cherries. There are relatively few European books devoted\r\nto them and in America, while there are treatises on all others of\r\nthe common tree-fruits, the cherry alone seems not to have inspired\r\nsome pomologist to print a book. Neither are the discussions in\r\ngeneral pomologies as full and accurate as for other fruits. The\r\nreason for this neglect is that the cherry, until the last decade\r\nor two, has scarcely been a fruit of commerce, having been grown\r\nalmost entirely for home use or at most for the local market. As a\r\nresult of this neglect of the cherry by students of pomology, we have\r\nno authoritative nor serviceable system of classification of the\r\nvarieties of cherries and the nomenclature of this fruit is in an\r\nappalling state of confusion, as a glance at the synonymy of some of\r\nthe older varieties discussed in _The Cherries of New York_ will show.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMELIORATION OF THE CHERRY\r\n\r\nThe amelioration of the cherry has been in progress almost since\r\nthe dawn of civilization, yet few men have directed their efforts\r\ntoward the improvement of this fruit. The histories of the varieties\r\ndescribed in _The Cherries of New York_ show that nearly all of them\r\nhave come from chance seedlings. Possibly there has been little\r\ninterest in improving cherries because this fruit is comparatively\r\nimmutable in its characters.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that there are a great number of varieties,\r\n1,145 being described in _The Cherries of New York_, this of all\r\nstone-fruits is most fixed in its characters. The differences between\r\ntree and fruit in the many varieties are less marked than in the\r\nother fruits of Prunus and the varieties come more nearly true to\r\nseed. Though probably domesticated as long ago as any other of the\r\ntree-fruits, the cherry is now most of all like its wild progenitors.\r\nThe plum is very closely related to the cherry but it has varied\r\nin nature and under cultivation much more than the cherry and in\r\naccordance with different environments has developed more marked\r\ndifferences in its species to endure the conditions brought about by\r\nthe topographical and climatic changes through which the earth has\r\npassed. Under domestication more than twice as many orchard varieties\r\nof the plum have come into being as of the cherry. In spite of this\r\nstability, there are ample rewards in breeding cherries to those\r\nwho will put in practice rightly directed efforts to improve this\r\nfruit--a statement substantiated by the histories of some of the\r\nbest varieties, described later in this text, which were originated\r\nthrough what was passing as current coin in plant-breeding before the\r\nfar better methods of the present time, brought about by Mendel's\r\ndiscovery, came into being.\r\n\r\nThe cherry, as the histories of its many diverse kinds show, has been\r\nimproved only through new varieties. There is no evidence, whatever,\r\nto show that any one of the several hundred cherries described in this\r\ntext has been improved by selection as a cumulative process, or, on\r\nthe other hand, that any one of them has cumulatively degenerated.\r\nOf varieties cultivated for their fruits there are no records of\r\nmutations either from the seed or from bud, though of the ornamental\r\ncherries not a few have arisen as bud-mutations, as, for example, the\r\nseveral double-flowered cherries and those of weeping or fastigiate\r\nhabit of growth and the many sorts with abnormally colored foliage.\r\nSince improvement depends upon the bringing into being of new cherries\r\nit becomes highly important to know how the varieties we are dealing\r\nwith in _The Cherries of New York_ have come into existence. The\r\nfollowing is a summary of their manner of origin:--\r\n\r\nNo case is recorded in _The Cherries of New York_ of a variety known\r\nto have come from self-fertilized seed.\r\n\r\nThe seed parent is given for 61 varieties. The statements as to seed\r\nparents are probably accurate, for a man planting cherry seeds would\r\nrecord the name of the seed parent correctly if he knew it.\r\n\r\nThe seed and pollen parents of twenty of the cherries described in\r\nthis work are given. Sixteen of these are hybrids originating with\r\nProfessor N. E. Hansen of South Dakota, leaving but four sorts the\r\nparents of which were known before the recent work of Professor Hansen.\r\n\r\nNo cherry cultivated for its fruit is reported to have come from a\r\nsport or a bud-mutation.\r\n\r\nCherries arising from seed sown without knowledge of either parent\r\nor from natural seedlings are put down as chance seedlings; of these\r\nthere are 147.\r\n\r\nThe origin of 917 of the varieties here described is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe total number of cherries under discussion is 1,145.\r\n\r\nTo improve the cherry the breeder must know the material with which he\r\nis working. The following is a brief discussion of the characters of\r\nthis fruit to be found in the technical descriptions of species and\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE AND FRUIT CHARACTERS OF THE CHERRY\r\n\r\nSpecies of cherries have very characteristic trees. The merest\r\nglance at the tree enables one to tell the Sweet Cherry, _Prunus\r\navium_, from the Sour Cherry, _Prunus cerasus_. The first named is\r\nthe larger of the two, especially reaching a greater height, is\r\npyramidal in shape, with branches erect and bearing much less foliage\r\nthan the Sour Cherry. The Sweet Cherry often lives for a century or\r\nmore--the Sour Cherry attains but the three score years and ten of\r\nman. _Prunus cerasus_ is easily distinguished from _Prunus avium_ by\r\nits comparatively low, roundish and never pyramidal head. So, too,\r\nmany of the varieties of either of these two species are readily\r\ntold in the orchard by the size or habit of the plant. Other species\r\nare either shrubby or tree-like and their varieties may often be\r\nidentified from the spaciousness or dwarfness of its trees. Size\r\nis rather more variable than other gross characters because of the\r\ninfluence of environment--food, moisture, light, isolation, pests\r\nand the like--yet size in a plant, or in the parts of a plant, is\r\na very reliable character when proper allowances have been made for\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nHabit of growth, unlike size, varies but little with changing\r\nconditions and thus becomes a most important means of distinguishing\r\nspecies and varieties and not infrequently sets the seal and sign of\r\ndesirability for an orchard cherry. More than any other character,\r\nhabit of growth gives what is called \"aspect\" to a cherry tree. Thus,\r\na species or a variety may be upright, spreading, round-topped,\r\ndrooping or weeping in habit of growth; the head may be open or dense\r\nand may be formed by a central shaft with several whorls of branches\r\nor by three or four trunk-like stems each with its scaffolding\r\nbranches. The trees may grow rapidly or slowly and may be long-lived\r\nor short-lived. The trunks may be short and stocky, or long and\r\nslender, straight or crooked, gnarled or smooth, these characters\r\noften determining whether a cherry is manageable or unmanageable in\r\nthe orchard.\r\n\r\nThe degree of hardiness is a very important diagnostic character\r\nfor groups of cherries and often wholly indicates their value for\r\nagriculture. Thus, the varieties of _Prunus avium_ are but little\r\nhardier than the peach while those of _Prunus cerasus_ are as hardy\r\nor hardier than the apple. The range of varieties as to hardiness\r\nfalls within that of the species and it is interesting to note that\r\nin Europe, where the wild _Prunus avium_ is very common, in the many\r\ncenturies since the fruit has been under domestication, a cultivated\r\nvariety hardier than the wild Sweet Cherry has not been developed.\r\nCherries are designated in the technical descriptions as hardy,\r\nhalf-hardy and tender.\r\n\r\nProductiveness, age of bearing, and regularity of bearing are\r\ndistinctive and valuable characters of orchard cherries but not\r\nof wild cherries. The care given the tree greatly influences\r\nfruitfulness, yet the quantity of fruit produced is often a helpful\r\nmeans of identifying a variety and is a character that must always\r\nbe considered by the plant-breeder. Age of bearing and regularity\r\nof bearing are most important characters with the pome fruits, the\r\napple, in particular, but while worth considering with the drupes are\r\nof relatively little value, all drupaceous fruits coming in bearing\r\nat about the same time for the species and all bearing regularly, as\r\na rule, unless interfered with by some outside agency preventing the\r\nsetting or causing the dropping of fruit.\r\n\r\nImmunity and susceptibility to diseases and insects are valuable\r\ntaxonomic characters of both species and varieties of cultivated\r\ncherries. Thus, the varieties of _Prunus cerasus_ are very\r\nsusceptible to black knot (_Plowrightia morbosa_), while those of\r\n_Prunus avium_ are almost immune. On the other hand, _Prunus avium_\r\nis an inviting prey to San José scale (_Aspidiotus perniciosus_),\r\nwhile _Prunus cerasus_ is but little injured, indeed, seldom attacked;\r\n_Prunus mahaleb_ appears to be almost wholly immune to the powdery\r\nmildew (_Podosphaera oxyacanthae_), while _Prunus avium_ and _Prunus\r\ncerasus_ are much attacked, though Wood, a variety of _Prunus\r\navium_, is almost immune. The English Morello, a variety of _Prunus\r\ncerasus_, is very subject to leaf spot (_Cylindrosporium padi_), while\r\nMontmorency, of the same species, is nearly immune. These examples\r\ncan be multiplied many times by references to the discussions of\r\nvarieties, and represent only observations on the grounds and in the\r\nneighborhood of this Station. They serve to show the great importance,\r\nto the fruit-grower, the plant-breeder and the systematist, of natural\r\nresistance to disease and insects.\r\n\r\nBoth the outer and the inner bark have considerable value in\r\ndetermining species but are of little importance in identifying\r\nvarieties and have no economic value to the fruit-grower and hence\r\nbut little to the breeder. Smoothness, color, thickness and manner\r\nof exfoliation are the attributes of the outer bark to be noted,\r\nwhile the color of the inner bark is the only determinant and that\r\nrelatively unimportant. In young trees the bark of the cherry of all\r\nspecies is smooth, glossy or even brilliant; but later it becomes\r\nuneven, scaly and dull, usually ash-gray but varying in all of these\r\ncharacters to an extent well worth noting for taxonomic purposes.\r\nCherries, in common with most trees, have a lighter colored bark in\r\ncold than in warm regions, and in dry than in wet areas.\r\n\r\nBranches and branchlets are very characteristic in both species\r\nand varieties. The length, thickness, direction, rigidity and the\r\nbranching angle are valuable determining characters and very stable\r\nones, changing but little even with marked variations of soil and\r\nclimate. Thus, a Sweet Cherry tree can be told from a tree of the Sour\r\nCherry, or the English Morello can be distinguished from Montmorency\r\nby branch characters as far as the outlines of the trees are\r\ndiscernible. Few cherries bear spines but all are more or less spurred\r\nand these spurs are quite characteristic even in varieties. With the\r\nbranchlets the length of the internodes should be considered and their\r\ndirection, whether straight or zigzag; also color, smoothness, amount\r\nof pubescence, size and appearance of the lenticels, the presence\r\nof excrescences, are all to be noted in careful study though all\r\nare more or less variable, pubescence especially so, this character\r\nbeing too often relied upon in descriptions by European botanists and\r\npomologists.\r\n\r\nLeaf-buds vary greatly in different species in size, shape, color of\r\nthe buds and of their outer and inner scales and in the outline of the\r\nscales. The angle at which the bud stands out from the branchlet is of\r\nsome taxonomic value. Vernation, or the disposition of the leaf-blade\r\nin the bud, is a fine mark of distinction in separating the cherry\r\nfrom other stone-fruits and while all cherry leaves are supposed to\r\nbe conduplicate, that is, folded by the midrib so that the two halves\r\nare face to face, yet there are slight but important differences in\r\nthe conduplication of the leaves in both species and varieties. The\r\nmanner of bearing buds--whether single, in pairs, or in rosettes--must\r\nbe taken into account, with species at least, and differences in shape\r\nand position of leaf and fruit-buds must be noted.\r\n\r\nLeaves in their season are very evident and either collectively or\r\nindividually are valuable determinants of species and varieties.\r\nFruit-growers take little note of leaves, however, though they should\r\nbe taken into practical account, since their size and number often\r\nindicate the degree of vigor. The variability of leaves is usually\r\nwithin limits easily set and occurs most often in young plants,\r\nin extremes of soil and climate, and on very succulent growths or\r\nwater-sprouts. Leaf-size is the most variable character of this\r\norgan but is yet dependable in separating several species, as, for\r\nexample, _Prunus avium_ from _Prunus cerasus_, the leaves being very\r\nmuch larger in the former than in the latter species. Leaf-forms are\r\nvery constant in species and varieties, hence especially valuable in\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nMuch care has been taken to illustrate accurately the size and form of\r\ncherry leaves in the color-plates in this text but it is impossible to\r\nreproduce by color-printing the tints of the leaves, though these are\r\nquite constant in both species and varieties.\r\n\r\nOther characters of leaves taken into account in describing cherries\r\nare thickness, roughness, and pubescence, all of which are somewhat\r\nvariable, being greatly influenced by climate and soil. Quite too much\r\nstress is laid upon the value of pubescence on leaves in determining\r\ngroups, unless comparisons can be made between plants growing in\r\nthe same habitat. Possibly more important than any other part of\r\nthe leaf-blade, in the study of species at least, is the margin.\r\nThis in the cherry is always serrated and often sub-serrated. These\r\nserrations are best studied at the middle of the sides of the leaves,\r\nthose at the base and apex often being crowded or wanting.\r\n\r\nThe petiole may be used to good advantage in distinguishing both\r\nspecies and varieties. Thus, in consequence of the great length and\r\nslenderness of the petiole of leaves of Sweet Cherries, the leaves\r\nare always more or less drooping, while those of the Sour Cherry are\r\nusually erect by reason of the petiole being short and strong. The\r\ncolor of the petiole is said by some to be correlated with that of\r\nthe fruit--a statement that needs verification. The pubescence of the\r\npetiole must be noted.\r\n\r\nThe position, size, shape and color of the glands on cherry leaves\r\nmust be noted as they are fairly constant guides. They are usually\r\non the petiole at the base of the leaf but are sometimes on the leaf\r\nitself. The glands are commonly given as globular or reniform in shape\r\nbut there are often intermediate forms the shape of which is hard to\r\nclassify.\r\n\r\nStipules in this plant have considerable taxonomic value, having\r\nsome distinguishing marks not possessed by the leaves. Cherry leaves\r\nspringing from dormant leaf-buds have very small stipules, sometimes\r\nso minute as hardly to be seen, but on the current year's growth the\r\nstipules are larger, being largest at the tip of the branchlet. There\r\nis considerable difference in the size of these organs in varieties\r\nof the same species. Stipules of the cherry are nearly always borne\r\nin pairs. The small stipules, appearing with the first leaves, drop,\r\nat this Station, about the middle of June while those accompanying\r\nthe later leaves on the wood growth of the current year remain until\r\nin July, there being a difference in varieties as to how long they\r\nremain. All stipules are deeply toothed and bear glands of varying\r\ncolor and shape on the serrations, the characters of both serrations\r\nand glands offering some distinguishing marks for species and\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of cherries are very characteristic, as a study of the\r\ncolor-plates of blossoms will show, furnishing a wholly distinctive\r\nmark of species and helping to distinguish varieties. The flowers\r\nare hermaphrodites and are borne in more or less dense, corymbose\r\nclusters. Individual flowers in species and varieties vary in size,\r\nshape, color and odor. The peduncles are long or short, as the case\r\nmay be; the corolla furnishes distinctions in size, shape and color\r\nof petals; the calyces are chiefly distinguished by their glands and\r\nthe amount and character of the pubescence; while stamens and pistils\r\noffer differences in size, color of their different parts and in the\r\nnumber of stamens. In plums the reproductive organs differ greatly in\r\nability to perform their functions, some varieties being self-sterile.\r\nIn New York there seem to be no marked differences in fecundity in\r\ncherries nor are there so frequently the malformations of reproductive\r\norgans which are found in plums. The season of flowering is a fine\r\nmark of distinction between species and varieties, a fact well brought\r\nout by the chart on pages 80-81.\r\n\r\nOf all organs, the fruit of the cherry is most responsive to\r\nchanged conditions and hence most variable, yet the fruits furnish\r\nvery valuable taxonomic characters in both botany and pomology. In\r\npomology, in particular, the fruits must be closely studied. Size,\r\nshape, color, bloom, stem, cavity, apex, suture and skin are the\r\noutward characters of which note must be made; while the color, aroma,\r\nflavor and texture of the flesh are usually very characteristic. Both\r\nspecies and varieties are well distinguished by the time of ripening\r\nthough there is much variation in ripening dates. The keeping quality\r\nis scarcely taken into account with cherries but varies a great\r\ndeal, chiefly in accordance with firmness of the flesh. The flesh\r\nof cherries, as in all drupaceous fruits, clings to the stone or is\r\nwholly or partly free--a character of interest both to the systematist\r\nand to the fruit-grower. The color of the juice, whether colorless\r\nor red, is a plain and certain dividing line in both species and\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe pits of cherries are rather more lacking in distinction than in\r\nother stone-fruits, plums for example, yet they must be accounted of\r\nconsiderable value in determination and for this reason have been\r\nincluded in all of the color-plates of varieties. Cherry-pits from\r\nindividual trees are almost lacking in differences except in size but\r\nbetween species and varieties show many distinctions not only in size\r\nbut in shape, surfaces, grooves and ridges, in the ends and more or\r\nless in the seeds within. Cherries of any variety grown on poor soils\r\nor in incongenial climates tend to have large stones and little flesh,\r\nwhile the pits are smaller and there is more flesh with the opposite\r\nextremes in environment. As will be pointed out in the discussion of\r\nthe group of cherries known as the Dukes, many varieties have pits\r\nwith shrunken and abortive seeds coming, as we think, from the hybrid\r\norigin of these cherries.\r\n\r\nThe several pages given to the discussion of the characters of\r\ncherries are in preparation for a proper understanding of the\r\nclassifications and descriptions of species and varieties. We are\r\nnow ready for the classification of the species of cherries which\r\ncontribute or may contribute forms for cultivation either for their\r\nfruits or as stocks upon which to grow edible cherries. The following\r\nis a brief conspectus of the edible species of Prunus followed by a\r\nfuller conspectus of the sub-genus Cerasus to which cherries belong.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CLASSIFICATION OF CULTIVATED CHERRIES\r\n\r\nThe genus Prunus is variously delimited and divided by systematic\r\nbotanists. A simple, and from a horticultural point of view, a very\r\nsatisfactory classification, is to put almonds and peaches in one\r\nsub-genus (Amygdalus), cherries in a second (Cerasus), plums and\r\napricots in a third (Euprunus), and to place the racemose cherries and\r\ncherry-laurels, usually considered in Prunus, in another genus, Padus.\r\nIn this division of Prunus into three sub-genera we may assign to each\r\nthe following characters.\r\n\r\n     A. Leaves convolute, _i. e._, rolled in the bud (showing best in\r\n            the opening buds).[3]\r\n\r\n                _Euprunus._ Plums and apricots.\r\n\r\n   A.A. Leaves conduplicate, _i. e._, folded lengthwise along the midrib\r\n       in the bud.\r\n\r\n         B. Fruit more or less dry and hirsute; if juicy or glabrous the\r\n            blossoms appear long before the opening of the leaves;\r\n            fruits without stems.\r\n\r\n                _Amygdalus._ Almonds and peaches.\r\n\r\n       B.B. Fruit always juicy and usually glabrous; blooms appearing\r\n            with the leaves.\r\n\r\n                _Cerasus._ Cherries.\r\n\r\nOf these several divisions we are here concerned only with Cerasus, to\r\nwhich belong all fascicled cherries, the racemose, or Padus, cherries as\r\nyet having little or no value as esculents. The genus Prunus is from\r\nyear to year being enlarged by the discovery of new species, the\r\nadditions to Cerasus in particular being numerous. Thus, a decade ago,\r\nbotanists placed in this sub-genus, at the outside, not more than a\r\nscore of species but Koehne, the most recent monographer of Cerasus,\r\ndescribes 119 species. Of Koehne's species at least a dozen are more or\r\nless cultivated for their fruits and a score or more are grown as\r\nornamentals.\r\n\r\nThe following species are listed by Koehne:[4]\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF CHERRIES\r\n\r\n  Div.

Southwestern Persia.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of these cherries is most interesting.[5]\r\nFrom North America come but five species of cherries but two of which,\r\n_Prunus besseyi_ and _Prunus pumila_, furnish food and these two as yet\r\nare but sparingly grown; all five, however, are more or less used as\r\nstocks.\r\n\r\nGreene[6] has described, in addition to the five accepted ones, eleven\r\nnew species of true cherries from the far west of the type of _Prunus\r\nemarginata_, some of which at least have furnished food to the Indians,\r\nminers and trappers and may have horticultural possibilities for the\r\ndesert regions in which they are found either for fruit or as stocks.\r\n\r\nFrom the western portion of the Old World, including all of Europe,\r\nnorthern Africa, Asia Minor, Persia, Turkestan and Afghanistan come 14\r\nspecies. From this region, though the number of species as compared with\r\nEast Asia is small, we have all of the cultivated esculent cherries, if\r\npossibly _Prunus tomentosa_ be excepted. Though nearly all of the\r\nspecies of this large territory are found--possibly all originated\r\nthere--in the southeastern part of Europe and the adjoining southwestern\r\npart of Asia, yet they seem, with one or two exceptions, to be quite\r\ndistinct from the species of the eastern half of the Old World--the\r\nHimalaya Mountains separating the two regions. It is probable that when\r\nwest central Asia has been as well explored botanically as the east\r\ncentral part of the continent, many new species will be added to Prunus\r\nand its sub-genus Cerasus.\r\n\r\nIt is in the eastern half of the Old World that the cherry flora is\r\nrichest. More than 100 of the 119 species of Cerasus recognized by\r\nKoehne are found in the Himalaya Mountains and the region to the east\r\nincluding Japan and the Kuril Islands. Yet out of all of this wealth of\r\nraw material only _Prunus tomentosa_ has been truly domesticated as an\r\nesculent though possibly a score of these species are well-known\r\nornamentals. Of the 100 eastern Asiatic species about 75 belong to\r\nChina--the remainder to Formosa, Siam and Japan with its islands.\r\nHappily these Chinese cherries are being introduced, but a few at a\r\ntime, it is true, to Europe and America and it can hardly be otherwise\r\nthan that they will enrich horticulture as they are domesticated,\r\nhybridized or used as a consort upon which to grow the cherries now\r\nknown to cultivation. In particular, it may be expected that cherries\r\nfor the cold north and the bleak plains of our continent will be evolved\r\nfrom the Asiatic species better suited to these regions than the\r\ncultivated cherries we now grow.\r\n\r\nThe number and diversity of the species of cherries which this brief\r\nreview of Cerasus shows to exist suggest that our cultivated cherry\r\nflora is but begun. There can be no question but that others of these\r\nspecies than the few that have been domesticated will yield to\r\nimprovement under cultivation and furnish refreshing fruits. It is just\r\nas certain that new types, as valuable perhaps as the hybrid Dukes we\r\nnow have, can be produced through hybridization. In North America, we\r\nhave no satisfactory stock for cultivated Sweet and Sour Cherries. Both\r\nof the stocks now commonly used, the Mazzard and the Mahaleb, as we\r\nshall see, have weaknesses that unfit them for general use. Surely out\r\nof the great number of forms we have just listed a better stock than\r\neither of the two named can be found. No doubt, too, many of these new\r\nspecies, even though they do not furnish food, will prove valuable\r\ntimber or ornamental trees.\r\n\r\nWe are ready now for a more detailed discussion of the cultivated\r\nspecies of cherries.\r\n\r\n    [3] The leaves are conduplicate in vernation in a few species of\r\n    American plums; these species are intermediate between plums and\r\n    cherries.\r\n\r\n    [4] The species are given as classified by Koehne, _Plantae\r\n    Wilsonianae_ Pt. =2=:237-271. 1912. The liberty has been taken of\r\n    changing the form of Koehne's citations to conform to that used\r\n    at this Station. For the sake of brevity some of the citations\r\n    of the original author have been omitted. Space does not permit\r\n    the publication of Koehne's system of classification. This may be\r\n    found in _Plantae Wilsonianae_ Pt. =2=:226-237. 1912.\r\n\r\n    Conservative botanists will hardly accept all of Koehne's species,\r\n    in describing which the author tells us he labored under the\r\n    difficulty of paucity of material and that as more material comes\r\n    to hand there must, therefore, be revisions. These species are\r\n    provisionally accepted in _The Cherries of New York_ under the\r\n    belief that botany and horticulture are best served by giving\r\n    names freely so that all forms to which reference may need to be\r\n    made may thus be better identified.\r\n\r\n    The botanical student of Cerasus is referred to Schneider's\r\n    comprehensive discussion of Prunus in his _Handbuch der\r\n    Laubholzkunde_ =1=:589-637. 1906 and =2=:973-993; also Koehne's\r\n    monographs of Cerasus, Sargent, C. S., _Plantae Wilsonianae_ Pt.\r\n    =2=:197-271. 1912. Profitable though it might be, space does not\r\n    permit in _The Cherries of New York_ a botanical discussion of\r\n    other than the species cultivated for their fruits.\r\n\r\n    [5] Koehne has presented the results of a careful study of the\r\n    distribution of cherries in _Mitt.

Yet the names given are scarcely a tithe of those that have been\r\ndiscarded or superseded for a whole or a part of this species by\r\nbotanists. Happily, there is no language in which there is a\r\npossibility of confusing the Sour Cherry with the other two or three\r\nspecies of cultivated cherries if the common names be used. That men,\r\nlearned or unlearned, speaking in their mother tongues distinguish\r\nspecies of cherries so readily by their common names, is ample excuse\r\nfor not attempting to give in a pomological work all of the Latin names\r\nof the Sour Cherry that have been used by the many men who have at one\r\ntime or another attempted to classify the plants in Prunus. Those here\r\npublished are from botanists who have contributed most to the knowledge\r\nof the species.\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_ is the Sour Cherry, or Pie Cherry, of many\r\nlanguages--grown and esteemed in temperate climates the world over and\r\nprobably the most widely distributed of all tree fruits. The species\r\nis found truly wild, as we have set forth in detail in the following\r\nchapter, in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe. It is a frequent\r\nescape from cultivation, multiplying from seed distributed by birds\r\nor human agencies or growing from suckers which spring so freely from\r\nthe roots as to make the species unfit for a stock in orchard work.\r\nThe number of cultivated varieties of _Prunus cerasus_ listed in _The\r\nCherries of New York_ is 270. Sour Cherries cultivated for their fruits\r\nconstitute two distinct groups, each of which is again divided into\r\nmany varieties. The two groups vary more or less in both tree and\r\nfruit but have a constant difference only in a single, very easily\r\ndistinguished character--the juice in the fruits of one is red, in the\r\nother it is colorless.\r\n\r\nThe cherries with colorless juice are the Amarelles, from the Latin for\r\nbitter, a term probably first used by the Germans but now in general use\r\nwherever these cherries are grown, though the English often designate\r\nthem as Kentish cherries and the French as Cerisier Commun. These\r\nAmarelles are pale red fruits, more or less flattened at the ends.\r\nDespite the derivation of the name Amarelle, they have less bitterness\r\nthan the other group of varieties of the Sour Cherry. They are also less\r\nacid than the darker colored cherries and are therefore more suitable\r\nfor eating out of hand while the dark colored cherries are almost\r\nexclusively culinary fruits. The common representatives of this group\r\nare Early Richmond, Montmorency and the various cherries to which the\r\nword Amarelle is affixed, as the King Amarelle and the Späte Amarelle.\r\n\r\nThe second group, varieties with reddish juice and usually with very\r\ndark fruits which are more spherical or cordate in shape than the\r\nAmarelles, comprises the Morellos of several languages or the Griottes\r\nof [Illustration: _PRUNUS CERASUS_ (MORELLO GROUP)] the French. The\r\nfirst of these terms has reference to the color, the word Morello coming\r\nfrom the Italian meaning blackish while Griotte, from the French,\r\nprobably is derived through agriotte from aigre, meaning sharp, in\r\nreference to the acidity of these cherries. Weichsel is the German group\r\nname for these cherries, rather less commonly used than the other two\r\nterms. The trees of the Morello-like varieties are usually smaller,\r\nbushier and more compact than those of the Amarelles. The branches, as a\r\nrule, are more horizontal, often drooping, are less regularly arranged\r\nand are more slender. The leaves, in typical varieties, are smaller,\r\nthinner, a darker green and are pendant while those of the Amarelles are\r\neither inclined to be upright or horizontal; the leaves are also toothed\r\nless deeply and more regularly. These differences in the leaves are well\r\nshown in the color-plates of the varieties of the two groups. There are\r\ndifferences, also, in the inflorescence and the floral organs in the\r\nextreme types but these disappear in the varieties that connect the two\r\nforms. The typical varieties of this group are English Morello, Ostheim,\r\nOlivet, Brusseler Braune, Vladimir and Riga.\r\n\r\nAttempts to give precise distinctions between the fruits and trees of\r\nthe two groups fail because the varieties constituting them hybridize\r\nfreely making it impossible, with the more or less blended characters,\r\nto classify accurately. The group name indicates but little more than\r\nwhether the cherries have a colored or a colorless juice--a distinction\r\nwell worth while for the fruit-grower.\r\n\r\nEhrhart called Sour Cherries with colorless juice _Prunus acida_ and\r\nthose with dark colored juice _Prunus austera_. To some extent botanists\r\nhave followed Ehrhart's designations. Linnaeus thought the two groups\r\nsufficiently distinct to be botanical varieties of the species and\r\ndenominated the cherry with colorless juice _Prunus cerasus caproniana_\r\nand the one with colored juice _Prunus cerasus austera_.\r\n\r\nA third division of the species is the Marasca cherry from which is made\r\nmaraschino, a distilled liqueur much used in Europe as a drink and in\r\nEurope and America in the manufacture of maraschino cherries. The\r\nMarasca cherry is a native of the province of Dalmatia, Austria, where\r\nthe trees grow wild and are now sparingly cultivated. In 1831 Host gave\r\nthis form the name _Cerasus marasca_ and a year later Reichenbach\r\ndescribed it as _Prunus marasca_. Botanists now very generally include\r\nit in the species under discussion and Schneider[7] makes it a botanical\r\nvariety, _Prunus cerasus marasca_, a disposition which we believe to be\r\nthe best. The Marasca cherries differ from the other cultivated forms\r\nchiefly in the greater vigor of the trees, relatively finer serrations\r\nof the leaves, longer stipules and a more compact inflorescence. The\r\nfruits are much smaller than in the common Sour Cherries, are deep red\r\nor almost black in color and have intensely red flesh and juice. The\r\ncherries are very acid with a bitter taste that gives flavor to the\r\nmaraschino made from them.\r\n\r\nBesides these divisions of the species cultivated for their fruits\r\nbotanists describe several botanical forms which either have no\r\nhorticultural value or are cultivated exclusively as ornamentals. It is\r\nnot necessary to discuss these in a pomological work. Of these botanical\r\nderivatives of _Prunus cerasus_, Schneider enumerates nine and three\r\nhybrids between this and other species.[8]\r\n\r\n    [7] Schneider, C. K. _Handb.

In the wild state it is\r\nvariously called Mazzard, Bird, Wild, Crab and the Gean cherry. It is\r\nnot as hardy a species as _Prunus cerasus_ and is, therefore, less\r\ngenerally grown but still is a favorite orchard, dooryard and roadside\r\nplant in all mid-temperate regions. It refuses to grow, however, in the\r\nwarmest and coldest parts of the temperate zones. Wherever the species\r\nthrives as an orchard plant it is to be found growing spontaneously\r\nalong fences and roadsides and in open woods from seeds distributed by\r\nbirds. The fruits of these wild Sweet Cherries are usually small and the\r\nflesh thin and dry, often unpalatable; but, on the other hand, trees are\r\nsometimes found as escapes from cultivation which rival in their\r\nproducts the orchard-grown cherries. It is from reverted seedlings that\r\nthe description of the species herewith given has been made. The number\r\nof cultivated varieties of _Prunus avium_ listed in _The Cherries of New\r\nYork_ is 549.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of the species and its history as a cultivated plant are\r\ngiven in the following chapter. A further point of horticultural\r\ninterest as regards its habitat is that wherever found truly wild, as in\r\nits original home in southern and central Europe and Asia Minor, it is\r\nto be found in moderately dry, calcareous soils and seldom in the shade,\r\npreferring always warm, sunny sites, as gravelly or stony hillsides.\r\nThese predilections cling to the species in its cultivated varieties.\r\n_Prunus avium_ differs from _Prunus cerasus_ in an important\r\nhorticultural character as the two species grow spontaneously--the\r\nformer suckers from the root little or not at all, making it a suitable\r\nplant for a stock in orchard work, while the latter suckers so much as\r\nto make it unfit for use as a stock.\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ is variously divided by botanists and pomologists.\r\nWhatever distinct forms of the species may exist in the wild state, they\r\nare now interminably confused by hybridization under cultivation. It is\r\nimpossible to divide the species into botanical varieties from the\r\ncharacters of the horticultural varieties, as many botanists have\r\nattempted to do. The species can be roughly divided into two pomological\r\ngroups, the distinguishing character being the texture of the flesh.\r\n\r\nSweet Cherries with soft, tender flesh form one group known by\r\npomologists under the French group name Guigne or the English Gean.\r\nThese are also the Heart cherries of common parlance. These soft-fruited\r\ncherries may again be divided into dark colored varieties with reddish\r\njuice and light colored sorts with colorless juice. Typical light\r\ncolored Geans are Coe, Ida, Elton and Waterloo; dark colored ones are\r\nBlack Tartarian, Early Purple and Eagle. It is to this group of cherries\r\nthat Linnaeus gave the varietal name _Juliana_ and De Candolle the\r\nspecific name _Cerasus Juliana_.\r\n\r\nThe second group is distinguished by the firm, breaking flesh of the\r\nfruits--the Bigarreaus of several languages, the name originally having\r\nreference to the diverse colors of the fruits. This group is further\r\ndivisible in accordance with color of fruit and juice into black\r\nBigarreaus and light Bigarreaus. Chief of the black cherries falling\r\ninto this division are Windsor, Schmidt and Mezel; of the light ones,\r\nwhich are much more numerous, Yellow Spanish and Napoleon are\r\nrepresentative sorts. Linnaeus called these hard-fleshed cherries\r\n_Prunus avium duracina_; De Candolle called them _Cerasus duracina_; K.\r\nKoch, _Prunus avium decumana_; and Roemer, _Cerasus bigarella_.\r\n\r\nBesides these two orchard forms of _Prunus avium_ several other\r\nhorticultural forms, quite as distinct or even more so, are grown as\r\nornamentals, some of which are listed as distinct species or as\r\nbotanical varieties of _Prunus avium_. To add to the confusion, a number\r\nof Latinized garden names are more or less commonly applied to these\r\nornamental Sweet Cherries. Schneider,[9] in revising the genus Prunus,\r\nnames four botanical forms of _Prunus avium_ and two natural hybrids\r\nwith other species.\r\n\r\n    [9] Schneider, C. K. _Handb. Laubh._ =1=:1906; =2=:1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNUS AVIUM × PRUNUS CERASUS\r\n\r\nThe Duke cherries, long placed by most pomologists and botanists in a\r\nbotanical variety of _Prunus avium_, are unquestionably hybrids between\r\nthe Sweet Cherry and the Sour Cherry. A study of the characters of the\r\nvarieties of the Duke cherries shows all gradations between _Prunus\r\ncerasus_ and _Prunus avium_, though, in the main, they resemble the\r\nlatter more than the former, differing from the Sweet Cherries most\r\nnoticeably in having an acid flesh. Sterility is a common attribute of\r\nhybridism. In this respect the Dukes behave like most hybrids. In\r\nseveral Duke cherries all of the seeds collected at this Station are\r\nsterile; in others, most of them are sterile and in none are the seeds\r\nas fertile as in varieties known to be pure bred as to species. So, too,\r\nshrunken pollen grains indicate hybridity. A study of the pollen of the\r\nDuke cherries shows many grains, the greater proportion, to be abnormal,\r\na condition not found in the pollen of varieties true to species. May\r\nDuke, Reine Hortense and Late Duke are the leading hybrid varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUNUS AVIUM × PRUNUS CERASUS (REINE HORTENSE)]\r\n\r\nThere are dark colored Duke cherries with reddish juice and light\r\ncolored sorts with uncolored juice, just as in the two parent species.\r\nMay Duke is a typical variety with colored juice while Reine Hortense is\r\nprobably the best-known cherry among these hybrids with uncolored juice.\r\nAbout 65 of the cherries listed in _The Cherries of New York_ are\r\n\"Dukes,\" or hybrids between the Sweet and the Sour Cherry.\r\n\r\nThe name Duke comes from the variety May Duke which is a corruption of\r\nMédoc, a district in the department of Geronde, France, from whence this\r\nvariety came. The cherries of this group are known as Dukes only in\r\nEngland; in France the name Royale is similarly used.\r\n\r\nThese hybrid cherries have been placed in a distinct botanical group by\r\nseveral botanists. They constitute the _Cerasus regalis_ Poiteau and\r\nTurpin (_Traite des Arb. Fruit_. 123); the _Cerasus bigarella regalis_\r\nRoemer (_Syn.

Wild or cultivated, the Mahaleb is a shallow-rooted plant, a fact\r\nthat must be taken into consideration in its use as a stock. _Prunus\r\nmahaleb_ is a common escape from cultivation in eastern North America\r\nespecially about the nursery centers of central New York.\r\n\r\nThe Mahaleb, or St. Lucie cherry, is of no importance to fruit-growers\r\nfor its fruit but as a consort with nearly all of the Sweet and Sour\r\nCherries now being propagated in North America it becomes of prime\r\nimportance and so receives botanical consideration here. According to\r\nSchneider, in the reference cited, there are several spontaneous forms\r\nof _Prunus mahaleb_ and also several horticultural varieties grown as\r\nornamentals. None of these, wild or cultivated, are of interest to\r\nfruit-growers, unless, perchance some one of them should prove to be a\r\nbetter stock upon which to work orchard cherries. Mahaleb stocks are\r\nusually grown as seedlings but may also be propagated from root\r\ncuttings.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the Mahaleb tree is of value in cabinet making, possessing\r\namong other good qualities a pleasant and lasting odor.

It\r\nhas been introduced into cultivation in many widely separated places in\r\nNorth America and appears to be promising for cold regions, both bud and\r\nwood withstanding perfectly the most rigorous climates of the United\r\nStates. As it grows in America it is a bush and never a true tree. It is\r\na twiggy, close-jointed plant, usually with many stems springing from\r\nthe ground and these bearing branches quite to the base. Frequently\r\nthese low-growing branches bend to the ground and take root forming new\r\nplants. The bushes are thickly clothed with leaves densely tomentose on\r\nthe underside, in this respect and in shape, as well, very unlike the\r\nfoliage of common cultivated cherries. The flowers appear in great\r\nabundance with the leaves, making a handsome ornamental; they are white,\r\nbecoming rose-colored as they fall away. The fruit ripens in mid-season\r\nfor cherries, setting profusely from the many blossoms. The cherries are\r\na half-inch in diameter, bright currant-red, covered with inconspicuous\r\nhairs and contain a stone of medium size. They are pleasantly acid, very\r\njuicy and withal a decided addition to cultivated cherries. _Prunus\r\ntomentosa_ seems a most promising plant for domestication and of\r\nparticular merit for small gardens and cold regions.\r\n\r\nKoehne, in his list of cherries, names ten botanical varieties of\r\n_Prunus tomentosa_. From this the species seems to be most variable and\r\nunder cultivation would probably break up into many forms some of which\r\nmight prove superior to the type species. Koehne's botanical varieties\r\nare given under the species on page 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNUS PUMILA Linnaeus.\r\n\r\n    1. Linnaeus _Mant. Pl._ 75. 1768. 2. Bailey _Cor. Bul. Ex.

In\r\nparticular it is common on the sand dunes of the Great Lakes. Everywhere\r\nin the wild state it grows in light sands suggesting its use in arid\r\nsoils and especially on poor soils in cold climates.\r\n\r\nAs yet there seem to be no named varieties of this cherry known to\r\nfruit-growers, its nearly related species, _Prunus besseyi_, offering\r\ngreater opportunities to both the fruit-grower and the experimenter.\r\nBoth the plants and fruits are so variable, the size, color and quality\r\nof the crop on some plants being quite attractive, that it is certain an\r\nopportunity to domesticate a worthy native plant is being overlooked.\r\nThe species ought to have value, too, as a stock on which to work other\r\ncherries for sandy soils, dwarf trees and exacting climates.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNUS CUNEATA Rafinesque.\r\n\r\n    1.

In its natural range it undoubtedly runs into\r\nthat of _Prunus pumila_ to the east, and Waugh, in the reference given,\r\nholds that the two species grade into each other and he, therefore,\r\nmakes this a variety of the eastern species. Certainly _Prunus pumila_\r\nand _Prunus besseyi_ are as distinct as are many other of the more or\r\nless indefinite species of this genus--few, indeed, are the species of\r\nPrunus that do not have outliers which overlap other types and, as we\r\nshall see, there are hybrids between this and species of other cherries,\r\nplums and even peaches and apricots, showing that the lines of\r\ndemarcation between the members of this genus are difficult to define.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Prunus besseyi_ has received attention from horticulturists\r\nless than a quarter-century it has aroused much interest, best\r\nindicated by the fact that now a considerable number of varieties of\r\nthe species are under cultivation and there are more than a score of\r\nhybrids disseminated in which it is one of the parents. Indians,\r\ntrappers and early settlers have long used the wild fruit under the name\r\nof Western Sand Cherry, Bessey's Cherry and Rocky Mountain Cherry. Among\r\npioneers this cherry was held in high esteem for sauces, pies and\r\npreserves and, where there was a dearth of cultivated cherries, was\r\neaten with relish out of hand. The flesh is tender, juicy and, while\r\nastringent as commonly found, plants bearing aromatic and very palatable\r\ncherries are often found growing wild while some of the domesticated\r\nplants bear very well-flavored fruits. All speak of the Sand Cherry as\r\nwonderful in productiveness and as having remarkable capacity to\r\nwithstand the vicissitudes of the exacting climate in which it grows. A\r\nvaluable asset of _Prunus besseyi_ is its great variability. Fruit from\r\ndifferent plants varies in size, color and flavor suggesting that, under\r\ncultivation, amelioration will proceed rapidly. The plants of this\r\nspecies root freely from layers or root-cuttings and are therefore\r\neasily propagated and multiplied.\r\n\r\nBut it is in its hybrids that this western cherry has proved most\r\nvaluable in horticulture. There are now hybrids under cultivation\r\nbetween this species and the Sand plum (_Prunus augustifolia watsoni_),\r\nthe Hortulana plum (_Prunus hortulana_), the Simonii plum (_Prunus\r\nsimonii_), the Japanese plum (_Prunus triflora_), the American plum\r\n(_Prunus americana_), the Cherry plum (_Prunus cerasifera_), the Sweet\r\nCherry (_Prunus avium_), the peach (_Prunus persica_), the apricots\r\n_(Prunus armeniaca_ and _Prunus mume_), and the common plum _(Prunus\r\ndomestica_). It would almost seem that this species is the \"go-between\"\r\nof the many and varied types of the genus Prunus. It is true that few of\r\nthese hybrids yet shine as orchard plants but, given time, it seems\r\ncertain that some will prove valuable in general horticulture and that\r\nmany will be grown in the special horticulture of the northern\r\nMississippi Valley and the adjoining plains to the west. Credit must be\r\ngiven to Professor N. E. Hansen of the South Dakota Experiment Station\r\nfor most of our present knowledge of hybridism between this and other\r\nspecies.[10]\r\n\r\nIn his work with this species Hansen has also found that _Prunus\r\nbesseyi_ makes a very good stock for peaches, apricots, Japanese and\r\nnative plums and that, while it does not so readily consort with the\r\ntrue cherries, yet it can be used as a stock for them. On the other\r\nhand larger fruits of the Sand Cherry can be grown when it is budded on\r\nstocks of the Americana.\r\n\r\n    [10] See bulletins 87 (1904), 88 (1904), 108 (1908) and 130 (1911)\r\n    from the South Dakota Experiment Station, Brookings, S. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR SPECIES\r\n\r\nBesides these well-recognized species of cultivated cherries there are\r\nseveral others that play a much less conspicuous part in horticulture.\r\n_Prunus fruticosa_ Pallas, the Dwarf Cherry of Europe, is much\r\ncultivated, more especially its botanical variety _pendula_, as an\r\nornamental and somewhat for its fruit. According to Wilson,[11] _Prunus\r\ninvolucrata_ Koehne is grown for its fruit in the gardens of China; the\r\nfruits, he says, are \"small and lacking in flavour.\" The fruits of\r\n_Prunus emarginata_ Walpers are eaten by the Indians on the Pacific\r\nCoast and the early settlers used the species as a stock for orchard\r\ncherries. _Prunus jacquemontii_ Hooker, the Dwarf Cherry of Afghanistan\r\nand Tibet, is occasionally in culture for its fruit and as a park plant;\r\nso also is another dwarf cherry from southwestern Asia, _Prunus incana_\r\nSteven. _Prunus pseudocerasus_ Lindley, the Flowering Cherry of Japan,\r\nis a well-known ornamental the world over and in Japan is used as a\r\nstock for orchard cherries for which purpose, as we have suggested in\r\nthe discussion of stocks, it ought to be tried in America.\r\n\r\n    [11] Wilson, E. H. _A Naturalist in Western China_ =2=:27. 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF CULTIVATED CHERRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT USE OF CHERRIES\r\n\r\nHistory casts no direct light upon the period when the cherry first came\r\nunder cultivation. Undoubtedly primitive men in all parts of the North\r\nTemperate Zone enlivened their scanty fruit fare with wild cherries.\r\nCultivated cherries, we know, had their origin in the Old World. But\r\nhistory tells us nothing of the period when Europe and Asia were\r\nunbroken forests inhabitated by savages who eked out a precarious\r\nsubsistence by the pursuit of the chase and from meagre harvests of wild\r\ngrains, fruits and vegetables. On these continents agriculture and rude\r\ncivilization began in ages immemorial and cultivated plants diversified,\r\nenriched and adorned the landscapes long before the first written\r\nrecords. Our knowledge of how wild cherries have been remodeled into the\r\norchard and garden varieties of today--of what the methods and\r\nprocesses of domestication have been--is, therefore, doubtful and\r\nlimited, for the mind and hand of man had been deeply impressed upon the\r\ncherry long before the faint traditions which have been transmitted to\r\nour day could possibly have arisen.\r\n\r\nThe history of the cherry, then, goes back to primitive man. Direct\r\nproof of the ancient use of cherries is furnished by the finding of\r\ncherry-pits of several species in the deposits of Swiss lake-dwellings,\r\nin the mounds and cliff-caves of prehistoric inhabitants of America and\r\nin the ancient rubbish-heaps of Scandinavian countries. There are but\r\nfew regions in which cultivated cherries are grown in which the\r\ninhabitants in times of stress, or by choice in times of plenty, do not\r\nnow use as food wild cherries, some species of which grow in abundance\r\nand under the most varied conditions, almost from the Arctic Circle to\r\nwithin a few degrees of the Tropic of Cancer in a belt encircling the\r\nglobe. It is probable that all of the wild species which have furnished\r\nfruit to the aborigines or to the modern inhabitants of a region have\r\nbeen sparingly cultivated--at the very least if they possessed any\r\nconsiderable food value they have been more or less widely distributed\r\nby the hand of man. But, curiously enough, out of the score or more of\r\nspecies of which the fruit is used as food as the plants grow wild, but\r\ntwo may be said to be truly domesticated. These are the Sour, or Pie\r\nCherry, _Prunus cerasus_, and the Sweet Cherry, _Prunus avium_, with\r\nthe histories of which we are now to be concerned.\r\n\r\nPliny is generally accredited as the first historian of the cherry.\r\nNearly eighteen and a half centuries ago he gave an account of the\r\ncherries of Rome with the statement that Lucullus, the Roman soldier and\r\ngourmet, had brought them to Rome 65 years before Christ[12] from the\r\nregion of the Black Sea. This particular in the account proves to be a\r\ngood illustration of the adage that old errors strike root deeply.\r\nThough disproved beyond all question of doubt time and time again by\r\nbotanists and historians, Pliny's inadvertence is still everywhere\r\ncurrent in text-books, pomologies and cyclopaedias--a mis-statement\r\nstarted, repeated and perpetuated from medieval days when to be printed\r\nin Pliny was sufficient proof. That Lucullus brought to Italy a cherry\r\nand one which the Romans did not know there is no reason to doubt, but\r\nother cherries there must have been, not only wild but cultivated, of\r\n_Prunus cerasus_ at least and probably of _Prunus avium_, and in\r\ncomparative abundance long before Lucullus, returning from the war in\r\nPontus with Mithridates, brought to Rome a cherry. With this brief\r\nmention of Pliny's inaccuracy, we pass to more substantial facts in the\r\nhistory of the cherry.\r\n\r\nThe domestication of one or the other of the two generally cultivated\r\nspecies of cherries followed step by step the changes from savagery to\r\ncivilization in the countries of Europe and of western Asia. For, as one\r\nsorts the accumulated stores of botanical and historical evidence, it\r\nbecomes quickly apparent that both the Sweet and the Sour Cherry now\r\ngrow wild and long have done so in the region named and that, from the\r\ntime tillage of plants was first practiced in the Old World, this fruit\r\nhas been under cultivation, feeble, obscure, and interrupted by war and\r\nchase though its cultivation may have been. Certainly the history of the\r\ncherry is as old as that of agriculture in the southern European\r\ncountries and is interwritten with it.\r\n\r\nIn beginning the history of a cultivated plant the first step is to\r\nascertain where it grows spontaneously--where it may be found unplanted\r\nand unattended by man. This is the task now before us for _Prunus\r\ncerasus_ and _Prunus avium_, discussing them in the order named.\r\n\r\n    [12] See quotation on page 45.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF CULTIVATED CHERRIES\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_, of which the Montmorency is the commonest\r\nrepresentative in America, is now to be found wild wherever Sour\r\nCherries are much grown, for it is a favorite food of many birds which\r\nquickly scatter its seeds from centers of cultivation. Nearly all of the\r\nbotanies of temperate regions in which agriculture is carried on name\r\nthis cherry as an escape from cultivation into woods and hedgerows and\r\nalong roadsides. The Sour Cherry, then, is now to be found truly wild in\r\nmany parts of several continents. It is not so easy to say where the\r\nhabitat and what the condition before the species was cultivated. But\r\nbotany, archaeology, history and philology indicate that the original\r\nhabitat of the Sour Cherry is southeastern Europe and the nearby\r\ncountries in Asia.\r\n\r\nAfter saying that this cherry has been found wild in the forests of Asia\r\nMinor, the plains of Macedonia, on Mount Olympus and in neighboring\r\nterritories, De Candolle, however, limits its habitat to the region\r\n\"from the Caspian Sea to the environments of Constantinople.\"[13] But as\r\na wild plant this cherry must have spread over a far greater area. Even\r\nthe broadest boundaries of the habitat of _Prunus cerasus_ as set by De\r\nCandolle show over-caution. Thus, the Marasca cherry, a botanical\r\nvariety of _Prunus cerasus_, is most certainly wild in the Province of\r\nDalmatia on the Adriatic Sea in Austria; so, too, it is certain that\r\nthis species is feral as far away from De Candolle's center of\r\ndistribution as northern Austria and southern Germany and has been so\r\nfor untold ages. It is safe to say that the original source of the Sour\r\nCherry was the territory lying between Switzerland and the Adriatic Sea\r\non the west and the Caspian Sea and probably somewhat farther north on\r\nthe east. That is, our savage forefathers must have found this cherry in\r\nthe region thus outlined, probably in a much more extended territory,\r\ninto which it was brought in more or less remote times by agencies other\r\nthan human from De Candolle's smaller area of origin.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to define the geographic range of the wild Sweet Cherry.\r\nBotanists very generally agree that _Prunus avium_ as a wild plant\r\ninhabits all of the mainland of Europe in which the cultivated varieties\r\nof the species can be grown--that is, most of the continent south of\r\nSweden, and may be found wild well into southern Russia. The species is\r\nreported sparingly wild in northern Africa and is a very common wild\r\nplant in southern Asia as far east as northern India. It must not be\r\nthought that the plant is everywhere abundant in the great area outlined\r\nas its habitat. To the contrary, the Sweet Cherry is an uncommon wild\r\nplant in Spain, Italy and other parts of southern Europe. All\r\nauthorities agree that the region of greatest communal intensity for\r\n_Prunus avium_ is between the Caspian and Black Seas and south of these\r\nbodies of water. It might suffice to say that from about these seas the\r\nSweet Cherry came--that here grew the trunk from which branches were\r\nspread into other lands by birds and animals carrying the seeds from\r\nplace to place. The most important fact to be established, however, is\r\nthat this cherry has long grown spontaneously over a widely extended\r\nterritory and may, therefore, have been domesticated in several widely\r\nseparated regions.\r\n\r\n    [13] De Candolle, _Origin of Cultivated Plants_ 207. 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHERRY IN GREECE; THE FIRST RECORD OF CULTURE AND THE NAME\r\n\r\nHaving established the habitats of the two cultivated cherries we may\r\nnext ask when and where their cultivation began. The domestication of\r\nplants probably began in China--certainly Chinese agriculture long\r\nantedates that of any other nation now in existence of which we have\r\nrecords. Agriculture in China, historians roughly approximate, goes back\r\n4,000 years. But while the Chinese have many other species of cherry, as\r\nwe have seen, some of which may be said to be partially domesticated,\r\n_Prunus cerasus_ and _Prunus avium_ are not found wild in China and were\r\nonly in recent years introduced there as cultivated plants. Neither does\r\nthe cherry of our civilization seem to have been known in the second\r\ngreat agricultural region of the world--Egypt and the extreme southwest\r\nof Asia. At least there are no words for the cherry in the languages of\r\nthe peoples of that region and cherry pits have not been found with the\r\nremains of other plants in the tombs and ruins of Egypt, Assyria and\r\nBabylon. Nor does the cherry seem to have been cultivated in India until\r\ncomparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nThese very brief and general statements show that cherries were not\r\ncultivated in the first agricultural civilizations and serve to fix the\r\ntime and the place of the domestication of the cherry a little more\r\ndefinitely. Records of cherries as cultivated plants begin, so far as\r\nthe researches of botanical historians now show, with Greek civilization\r\nthough it is probable, for several reasons, that some cultivated\r\ncherries came to Greece from Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus, to whom Linnaeus gave the title \"Father of Botany,\"\r\nwriting about 300 years before the Christian era in his _History of\r\nPlants_, is, according to botanical historians, the first of the Greek\r\nwriters to mention the cherry. His statement is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The cherry is a peculiar tree, of large size, some attaining the height\r\nof twenty-four cubits, rather thick, so that they may measure two cubits\r\nin circumference at the base. The leaf is like that of the mespilus,\r\nrather firm and broader, the color of the foliage such that the tree may\r\nbe distinguished from others at a good distance. The bark, by its color,\r\nsmoothness and thickness, is like that of tilia. The flower [meaning,\r\nthe cluster of flowers] is white, resembling that of the pear and\r\nmespilus, consisting of small [separate] flowers. The fruit is red,\r\nsimilar to that of diospyros [but what his diospyros was no one knows]\r\nof the size of a faba [perhaps nelumbo seed], which is hard, but the\r\ncherry is soft. The tree grows in the same situations as tilia; by\r\nstreams.\"[14]\r\n\r\nFrom this passage we gather that the cherry Theophrastus knew was the\r\nSweet Cherry, _Prunus avium_; the description shows it to be the same\r\nlarge, tall tree now naturalized in open woods and along roadsides in\r\nmany parts of the United States. From the fact that Theophrastus\r\ndescribes the tree and the bark in more detail than the fruit we may\r\nassume that the cherry was more esteemed in ancient Greece as a\r\ntimber-tree than as a fruit-tree. Curiously enough the name the Greeks\r\nat this time used for the Sweet Cherry is now applied to _Prunus\r\ncerasus_, the Sour Cherry.\r\n\r\n\"Kerasos\" was the Sweet Cherry in ancient Greece and from kerasos came\r\n_cerasus_, used by many botanists as the name of the genus. That the\r\nSweet Cherry should by the use of _avium_ be denominated the \"bird\r\ncherry\" is clear since birds show much discrimination between cherries,\r\nbut why the Sour Cherry should be given the specific name _cerasus_,\r\nfirst applied to the Sweet Cherry, is not apparent.\r\n\r\nPages are written in the old pomologies and botanical histories as to\r\nthe origin of the word _cerasus_. Pliny's statement that Lucullus called\r\nthe cherry _cerasus_ from the town from which he obtained it, Kerasun in\r\nPontus, on the Black Sea, is, in the light of all who have since looked\r\ninto the matter, a misconception. To the contrary, commentators now\r\nagree that the town received its name from the cherry which grows most\r\nabundantly in the forests in that part of Asia Minor. The name,\r\naccording to all authorities, is very ancient--a linguistic proof of the\r\nantiquity of the cherry.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the cherry comes into literature first from Greece in the\r\nwritings of Theophrastus. There can be but little doubt, however, but\r\nthat it had been cultivated for centuries before Theophrastus wrote.\r\nWhether one or both of the two cherries were domesticated by the Greeks,\r\nbeginning with their civilization, or whether cultivated cherries came\r\nto Greece from Asia Minor, is not now known. It is very probable that\r\nsome of the several varieties grown in Greece came under cultivation\r\nthrough domestication of wild plants; others were introduced from\r\nregions farther east.\r\n\r\n    [14] Theophrastus, Book III, Chap. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEET CHERRY POSSIBLY THE PARENT OF THE SOUR CHERRY\r\n\r\nA digression may be permitted here to state a hypothesis suggested by De\r\nCandolle[15] which should interest both fruit-growers and\r\nplant-breeders. De Candolle, while considering the two species of\r\ncultivated cherries to be now quite distinct, suggests that, since they\r\ndiffer essentially but little in their characters and since their\r\noriginal habitats were in the same region, it is probable that one\r\nspecies came from the other. He surmises, since _Prunus avium_ is the\r\ncommoner in the original home, is generally the more vigorous of the\r\ntwo, has spread much farther and probably at a much earlier date from\r\nthe primal habitation in Asia Minor than _Prunus cerasus_, that the\r\nlatter, the Sour Cherry, is derived from the Sweet Cherry. In the future\r\nbreeding of cherries confirmatory evidence of such a relationship may be\r\nobtained though, should none be found, the negation should go for naught\r\nand the supposition can only remain an interesting and plausible\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n    [15] De Candolle, Alphonse _Origin of Cultivated Plants_ 210. 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHERRY IN ITALY\r\n\r\nPliny attempts to give the first full account of cultivated cherries\r\nand, even though among his statements are several inaccuracies, yet he\r\nmay be said to have made a very good beginning of a flora of cultivated\r\ncherries for he names and describes ten varieties. The fact that there\r\nwere as many as ten cherries in Italy at the time Pliny wrote, less than\r\na century after the return of Lucullus from Pontus, is strong evidence\r\nthat the cherry in Italy antedates Lucullus. Besides, it is hardly\r\nprobable that Pliny knew and described all of the cherries to be found\r\nin the whole of his country. But even if these ten comprise the entire\r\nnumber, those who know how extremely difficult it is to introduce new\r\nplants in a country with the facilities we have in our day, will doubt\r\nthat all of the cherries in Pliny's account could have been introduced\r\nin Italy 1900 years ago and have come under general cultivation, as\r\naccording to Pliny they had, within the short space of a century. The\r\nfollowing quotation, then, must be taken as an account of the cherries\r\ngrown in Italy in the first century after Christ with little weight\r\ngiven to the historical evidence presented.[16]\r\n\r\n\"The cherry did not exist in Italy before the period of the victory\r\ngained over Mithridates by L. Lucullus, in the year of the City 680. He\r\nwas the first to introduce this tree from Pontus, and now, in the course\r\nof one hundred and twenty years, it has travelled beyond the Ocean, and\r\narrived in Britannia even. The cherry, as we have already stated, in\r\nspite of every care, has been found impossible to rear in Egypt. Of this\r\nfruit, that known as the \"Apronian\" is the reddest variety, the Lutatian\r\nbeing the blackest, and the Caecilian perfectly round. The Junian cherry\r\nhas an agreeable flavour, but only, so to say, when eaten beneath the\r\ntree, as they are so remarkably delicate that they will not bear\r\ncarrying. The highest rank, however, has been awarded to the Duracinus\r\nvariety, known in Campania as the \"Plinian\" cherry, and in Belgica to\r\nthe Lusitanian cherry, as also to one that grows on the banks of the\r\nRhenus. This last kind has a third colour, being a mixture of black,\r\nred, and green, and has always the appearance of being just on the turn\r\nto ripening. It is less than five years since the kind known as the\r\n\"laurel-cherry\" was introduced, of a bitter but not unpleasant flavour,\r\nthe produce of a graft upon the laurel. The Macedonian cherry grows on a\r\ntree that is very small, and rarely exceeds three cubits in height;\r\nwhile the chamaecerasus is still smaller, being but a mere shrub. The\r\ncherry is one of the first trees to recompense the cultivator with its\r\nyearly growth; it loves cold localities and a site exposed to the north.\r\nThe fruits are sometimes dried in the sun, and preserved, like olives,\r\nin casks.\"\r\n\r\nHow are the cherries described in the passage from Pliny related to\r\nthose of modern culture? A score or more of commentators have tried to\r\ntell but when the comments are compared Pliny's disorder becomes\r\nconfusion worse confounded. Here, as in his historical statements, Pliny\r\nseems to have prepared the ground for a fine crop of misunderstandings.\r\nThe speculations as to what particular cherry each of the descriptions\r\nfits quickly show the futility of specification. A few generalizations\r\nonly are warranted.\r\n\r\nThus, if we assume, as most commentators do, that Apronian, the first\r\nof Pliny's varieties, was named after Apronius, a Roman praetor of\r\nPliny's day, there is nothing to indicate the character of the cherry\r\nexcept the word \"reddest\" which means but little for it is no more\r\npossible to distinguish cherries by redness than by its blackness to\r\ntell a pot from a kettle.\r\n\r\nIt is as impossible to distinguish the second variety as the first. The\r\nname given is Lutatian, the variety having been dedicated, as all\r\ncommentators agree, to Lutatius Catulus, a contemporary of Lucullus,\r\nrevered by Romans for having rebuilt the capitol after it had been\r\ndestroyed by fire. It is described as \"being the blackest\" but whether\r\n_Prunus avium_ or _Prunus cerasus_, sweet or sour, who can tell?\r\n\r\nThe third variety is called the Caecilian cherry, which we are told is\r\n\"perfectly round\"--a character possessed in like degree by many\r\ncherries. The name, on the authority of Latin scholars, commemorates the\r\nCaecilius family, rich and powerful Romans, friends of Lucullus at the\r\ntime he was promoting cherry culture.\r\n\r\nWe may be a little more certain of the identity of the fourth cherry,\r\ncalled the Junian, and said to have been possessed of \"an agreeable\r\nflavor but only, so to say, when eaten beneath the tree, as they are so\r\nremarkably delicate that they will not bear carrying.\" Whether the name\r\nwas given in honor of the Roman Republican, Junius Brutus, who died 42\r\nA. D. or from Junius, the month of their ripening, cannot be said. The\r\ndescription, as practically all agree, fits very well the French Guigne\r\nor English Gean group of cherries. It is probable that \"Guigne\" is a\r\nperversion of \"Junian.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be little question as to the cherry Pliny next describes, \"the\r\nDuracinus variety\" which he says has been awarded \"highest rank\" and to\r\nwhich he paid the compliment of giving it his own name, for he tells us\r\nthat it is \"known in Campania as the Plinian cherry.\" This hard-fleshed\r\ncherry of delectable quality can be no other than a Bigarreau--some\r\nprotean Napoleon, Yellow Spanish, Windsor or the older Oxheart and\r\nElkhorn.\r\n\r\nThe sixth cherry is the Lusitanian, which, if the translations read\r\naright, the Belgians rank highest. Ancient Lusitania is modern Portugal\r\nand the Lusitanian cherry may be the Griotte of Portugal grown from time\r\nimmemorial in that country. The identity of the variety is not so\r\nimportant in this passage as is the connection that Pliny establishes in\r\ncherry culture at this early time between Portugal, Italy and Belgium.\r\nBy such tokens does our author cast doubt upon his statement that\r\nLucullus had but yesterday, as it were, brought the cherry from Pontus.\r\n\r\nThe seventh cherry is one \"that grows on the banks of the Rhenus\"\r\n(Rhine), further described as \"being a mixture of black, red and green,\"\r\nand of having \"always the appearance of being just on the turn to\r\nripening.\" It is useless to add another guess to those of the many\r\ncommentators as to what this tri-colored cherry from the banks of the\r\nRhine may be.\r\n\r\nThe eighth description, that of the \"laurel-cherry,\" applies to a graft\r\nand not to a variety. Of it, Pliny says, \"It is less than five years\r\nsince the kind known as the laurel-cherry was introduced, of a bitter,\r\nbut not unpleasant flavor, the produce of a graft upon the laurel.\" It\r\nis barely possible that a cherry could be made to grow on a laurel five\r\nyears but it is extremely doubtful, as all modern horticulturists who\r\nhave tried it say, and it is impossible to have such a graft bear fruit.\r\nPliny was misinformed.\r\n\r\nThe ninth and tenth of Pliny's cherries, the Macedonian and the\r\nChamaecerasus, are probably one and the same, since but one cherry that\r\ncould possibly answer to the descriptions given could have been in Italy\r\nat the time Pliny wrote. The cherry described, then, was almost beyond\r\ndoubt _Prunus fruticosa_ Pallas, a synonym of which is _Prunus\r\nchamaecerasus_ Jacquin, perpetuating the name used by Pliny. This is the\r\nEuropean Dwarf Cherry, or Ground Cherry, which is now and was probably\r\nthen a wild plant in parts of Italy and which is very well described by\r\n\"a tree that is very small, and rarely exceeds three cubits in height.\"\r\n\r\nWe have accredited Pliny with having first described cherries in Italy\r\nand discredited his account of their introduction in his own country,\r\nbut chiefly on inferential evidence. Just a few words of direct proof\r\nthat the cherry was long in cultivation by the Romans before Lucullus\r\nand we have done with the introduction of the cherry into Italy and have\r\nfilled another gap between Theophrastus and our own times. Marcus\r\nTerentius Varro (B. C. 117-27), one of the illustrious scholars of\r\nancient Rome, sometimes called the father of Roman learning, in his\r\neightieth year, as he tells us in his first chapter, wrote a book on\r\nfarming--one, which, by the way, may be read with profit by modern\r\nfarmers.[17] In book 1, chapter XXXIX, he tells when to graft cherries,\r\ndiscussing the process not as if it or the cherry were new or little\r\nknown but as if the cherry were as commonplace as the other\r\nagricultural crops of the times. Varro effectually disproves Pliny to\r\nwhose mis-statement we have given so much space only because for nearly\r\n2000 years it has been generally accepted as the truth.\r\n\r\nThe gaps in the history of the cherry are long. Athenaeus,[18]\r\nTertullian,[19] Ammianus,[20] and St. Jerome,[21] Roman writers of the\r\nThird and Fourth Centuries, mention cherries but chiefly to repeat and\r\nperpetuate Pliny's errors. It was not until the Sixteenth Century--a\r\nlapse of 1400 years--that an attempt was again made to describe in full\r\ncultivated cherries. Sometime in this century, Matthiolus (1487-1577), a\r\nTuscan and one of the eminent naturalists not only of Italy but of the\r\nworld in the Middle Ages, in translating and annotating the medical\r\nworks of the Greek writer Dioscorides, made a list of the fruit-trees\r\nthen grown in Italy. As the second descriptive list of cherries this\r\ncontribution of Matthiolus might be worth reprinting were it not, as in\r\nPliny, that but few of his varieties can be certainly made out. He does,\r\nhowever, make a number of additions to Pliny's list but space does not\r\npermit a consideration of these; especially since Gerarde, writing less\r\nthan a century later in English, so well amplifies Matthiolus that we\r\nshall print his account.\r\n\r\n    [16] Bostock and Riley _Nat. History of Pliny_ =3=:322. 1855.\r\n\r\n    [17] A very good translation of Varro on farming is one by Lloyd\r\n    Starr-Best, published by G. Bell & Sons, London. 1912.\r\n\r\n    [18] Athenaeus _Dipnosophistæ_ Book II, Chap. XXXIV-V.\r\n\r\n    [19] Tertullian _Apologeticum_ Chap.

XVI.\r\n\r\n    [21] St. Jerome _Epistulae_ Book I, Letter XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRIES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nPliny mentions the cherry as growing in several countries and, by\r\nreading between lines, we may assume that cultivated cherries were\r\ndistributed throughout all parts of Europe where agriculture was\r\npracticed, by Christ's time or shortly thereafter. Pliny speaks of the\r\ncherry in some connection with England, Germany, Belgium and Portugal.\r\nSurely we may assume that the cherry was being grown at the same time in\r\nat least the countries in Europe which are between or border on those\r\nnamed. But from Pliny to the Sixteenth Century the current of progress\r\nin cherry culture was immeasurably slow. In the intervening 1600 years\r\nnot a score of new cherries were brought under cultivation. Attention\r\nwas probably given during these dark ages to this and to all fruits as\r\nspecies and as divisions of species which came nearly or quite true to\r\nseed. It was only in the refinements of horticulture and botany brought\r\nabout by the herbalists that true horticultural varieties came into\r\ncommon cultivation.\r\n\r\nThus, the first of the German herbals, the _Herbarius_, printed at Mainz\r\nin 1491, does not describe or even name varieties of cherries but groups\r\nthem in the two species as Sweets and Sours, the statement running:[22]\r\n\"The cherries are some sweet, some sour, like the wild apple; the sours\r\nbring to the stomach gas and make the mouth fresh (frisch), those too\r\nsweet or too sour are of little use.\" A wood-cut in this old herbal\r\nillustrates a Sour Cherry.\r\n\r\nAccording to Müller,[23] not until 1569 did the Germans attempt to give\r\nnames to varieties, when, in a medical herbal, the _Gart der\r\nGesundheit_, cherries were roughly divided into four groups: (1) The\r\nAmarellen, sour, dark red cherries with long stems. (2) The\r\nWeichselkirschen, red cherries with white juice and short stems. (3) The\r\nSüsskirschen, red or black Sweet Cherries with long stems. (4) \"Beside\r\nthese yet more\" distinguished by their shape and the province in which\r\nthey are grown. Not until well into the Eighteenth Century do the\r\nGermans seem to have given names to more than a few of the most distinct\r\nvarieties of cherries. Yet the cherry was more largely cultivated in\r\nGermany, one, two, or three centuries ago, as it is now, than in any\r\nother European country. This, one readily gleans from what has been\r\nwritten on cherries in different countries and from the acknowledgments\r\nof foreign pomologists to those of Germany for most of what has been\r\nprinted regarding cherries. Not only has the cherry been a favorite\r\norchard plant in Germany but since the Sixteenth Century it has been\r\nlargely planted along the public roads.\r\n\r\nOf cherries on the continent, for this brief history, nothing more need\r\nbe said. Most of the varieties that have been imported from Europe to\r\nAmerica have come from England and we must, therefore, devote rather\r\nmore attention to the history of the cherry in England than in other\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\n    [22] Quoted from Müller, Hugo M. _Obstzüchter_ =8=:3. 1910.\r\n\r\n    [23] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRIES IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nCultivated cherries came to England with the Romans. _Prunus avium_ is\r\nindigenous in Great Britain but probably no care worthy the name\r\ncultivation was given these wild trees by the ancient Britons. Pliny\r\nstates that the cherry was carried from Rome to Britain before the\r\nmiddle of the First Century--meaning probably some improved variety. In\r\nno part of the world does the cherry take more kindly to the soil than\r\nin England and no doubt this fruit became firmly established in Kent,\r\nwhere the Romans settled, before the downfall of the southern invaders.\r\nWith the expulsion of the Romans and the subsequent influx of\r\nbarbarians, agriculture, especially gardening and fruit-growing, became\r\nalmost a lost art but still it is not probable that the cherry was\r\nwholly lost to cultivation during the Teutonic invasions of Britain.\r\n\r\nFruit-growing could not have greatly prospered, however, in the\r\ncenturies of strife with the barbarians which succeeded Roman rule in\r\nEngland; and a revival of cherry culture did not take place until the\r\nreintroduction of Christianity and the establishment of monasteries\r\nwhere, undisturbed by wars, the monks became notable horticulturists.\r\nThey not only had opportunity in the comparative peace in which their\r\nlives were cast to grow fruit but many of them were men of superior\r\nintelligence and skill and from intercourse with the continental\r\ncountries learned what plants were worth growing and how to grow\r\nthem--the monasteries were the experiment stations of the times.\r\nUndoubtedly the monks in bringing to England treasures from the\r\ncontinent did not forget fruits and among them cherries.\r\n\r\nPassing by a considerable number of references which could be cited to\r\nshow that cherries of one kind and another were cultivated in Britain\r\nfrom at least as early a date as the Ninth Century, we come to the\r\ndiscussion of this fruit by the herbalists of the Sixteenth and\r\nSeventeenth Centuries. Of the three great English herbalists, Turner\r\npublished his work in 1538; Gerarde's, printed in 1596, was revised and\r\ngreatly improved by Johnson in 1633; Parkinson's _Paradisi in Sole\r\nParadisus Terrestris_, or Park-in-Suns Earthly Paradise--the author\r\nevidently a punster--was published in 1629. All of these contain as full\r\nbotanical and pomological discussions of cherries as knowledge then\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, by those unacquainted with the plant-lore of the\r\ntimes, that the cherry received consideration only from the pens of\r\nTurner, Gerarde, and Parkinson. During the time covered by the lives of\r\nthese three men a score or more of books were written in English on\r\nbotany and pomology in which accounts were given of the cherry, all\r\nshowing the esteem in which this fruit was held in England during and\r\nbefore the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Space permits comments on the\r\naccount of the cherry given by but one of these Elizabethan herbalists,\r\nand of the several Gerarde's seems best suited to our purpose.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen Gerarde because he treats the cherry more fully than do\r\nthe other writers of the period and because he was a compiler and a\r\ntranslator, having, as he quaintly says, \"perused divers Herbals set\r\nfourth in other languages;\" thus from Gerarde we obtain a conception of\r\ncherries growing on the continent as well as those growing in England.\r\nStudents of the English herbals say that Gerarde translated, copied and\r\nadapted from Matthiolus, whose book we have noted, but more particularly\r\nfrom Dodoens who in 1554 published in Antwerp _A History of Plants_.\r\nThese two worthies, in turn, had borrowed very freely from still more\r\nancient writers--Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Columella and others. As\r\nmight be suspected, errors centuries old were passed down, yet each new\r\ntranslation or compilation contains much added information and is far\r\nfreer from error. In particular, Gerarde seems to have been a wise\r\ncompiler and adapter and to have combined a large measure of first-hand\r\npractical knowledge with his borrowings from others. This is especially\r\ntrue of what he writes concerning cherries, a fruit with which he seems\r\nto have been very familiar.\r\n\r\nThe following is Gerarde's account, with interpolations by the author:\r\n\r\n    \"The ancient Herbalists have set down four kinds of Cherry trees;\r\n    the first is great and wild, the second tame or of the garden, the\r\n    third hath sour fruit, the fourth is that which is called in Latin\r\n    Chamaecerasus, or the dwarfe Cherry tree. The later writers have\r\n    found divers sorts more, some bringing forth great fruit, others\r\n    lesser; some with white fruit, some with blacke, others of the\r\n    colour of black bloud, varying infinitely according to the clymat\r\n    and country where they grow.\"\r\n\r\nThe four cherries which Gerarde says the \"ancient herbalists have set\r\ndown\" are, it is easy to see: first, the wild _Prunus avium_; second,\r\ncultivated sweet varieties of _Prunus avium_; third, the sour _Prunus\r\ncerasus_; fourth, the Dwarf Cherry, _Prunus fruticosa_.\r\n\r\n    \"The English Cherry tree groweth to a high and great tree, the\r\n    body whereof is of a mean bignesse, which is parted above into\r\n    very many boughes, with a barke somewhat smooth, of a brown\r\n    crimson colour, tough and pliable; the substance or timber is\r\n    also brown in the middle, and the outer part is somewhat white:\r\n    the leaves be great, broad, long, set with veins or nerves, and\r\n    sleightly nicked about the edges: the floures are white, of a mean\r\n    bigness, consisting of five leaves, and having certain threds in\r\n    the middle of the like colour. The Cherries be round, hanging\r\n    upon long stems or footstalks, with a stone in the middest which\r\n    is covered with a pulp or soft meat; the kernell thereof is not\r\n    unpleasant to the taste, though somewhat bitter.\"\r\n\r\nThis is _Prunus avium_, which is very generally wild in Britain--the\r\nGean of the English.\r\n\r\n    \"The Flanders Cherry tree differeth not from our English Cherry\r\n    tree in Stature or form of leaves or floures, the only difference\r\n    is, that this tree brings forth his fruit sooner and greater than\r\n    the other, wherefore it may be called in Latine, _Cerasus praecox,\r\n    sive Belgica_.\"\r\n\r\nA cherry which \"brings forth his fruit sooner and greater than the\r\nother\" can be no other than one of the early varieties of the Sweet\r\nCherry.\r\n\r\n    \"The Spanish Cherry tree groweth up to the height of our common\r\n    Cherry tree, the wood or timber is soft and loose, covered with a\r\n    whitish scaly barke, the branches are knotty, greater and fuller\r\n    of substance than any other Cherry tree; the leaves are likewise\r\n    greater and longer than any of the rest, in shape like those of\r\n    the Chestnut tree: the floures are like the others in form, but\r\n    whiter of colour; the fruit is greater and longer than any, white\r\n    for the most part all over, except those that stand in the hottest\r\n    place where the sun hath some reflexion against a wall: they are\r\n    also white within, and of a pleasant taste.\"\r\n\r\nWe have in this description a very good pen picture of Yellow Spanish,\r\none of the Bigarreaus, of which there must have been several in common\r\ncultivation in Gerarde's time.\r\n\r\n    \"The Gascoin Cherry tree groweth very like to the Spanish Cherry\r\n    tree in stature, flours and leaves: it differeth in that it\r\n    bringeth forth very great Cherries, long, sharp pointed, with a\r\n    certain hollownesse upon one side, and spotted here and there with\r\n    certain prickles of purple color as smal as sand. The taste is\r\n    most pleasant, and excelleth in beauty.\"\r\n\r\nGascoin, sometimes \"Gaskin\" in England, is a corruption of Gascoigne, a\r\nname applied by the French to cherries produced in Gascony and said to\r\nhave been brought to England by Joan of Kent when her husband, the Black\r\nPrince, was commanding in Guienne and Gascony. The variety is a very\r\ngood Sweet Cherry, no doubt the one described in this text under the\r\nname Bleeding Heart.\r\n\r\n    \"The late ripe Cherry tree groweth up like unto our wild English\r\n    Cherry tree, with the like leaves, branches and floures, saving\r\n    that they are sometimes once doubled; the fruit is small,\r\n    round, and of a darke bloudy colour when they be ripe, which\r\n    the Frenchmen gather with their stalkes, and hang them up in\r\n    their houses in bunches or handfulls against Winter, which the\r\n    Physitions do give unto their patients in hot and burning fevers,\r\n    being first steeped in a little warme water, that causeth them to\r\n    swell and plumpe as full and fresh as when they did grow upon the\r\n    tree.\r\n\r\n    \"The Cluster Cherry tree differeth not from the last described\r\n    either in leaves, branches, or stature: the floures are also like,\r\n    but never commeth any one of them to be double. The fruit is\r\n    round, red when they be ripe, and many growing upon one stem or\r\n    foot-stalke in clusters, like as the Grapes do. The taste is not\r\n    unpleasant although somewhat soure.\"\r\n\r\nThese two cherries, one sees at once, are varieties of _Prunus cerasus_.\r\nThe first, Gerarde identifies for us on a succeeding page as the\r\nMorello. He says of it: \"The late ripe cherries which the Frenchmen\r\nkeepe dried against the winter, and are by them called Morelle, and wee\r\nafter the same name call them Morell Cherries.\r\n\r\n    \"This Cherrie-tree with double floures growes up unto a small\r\n    tree, not unlike to the common Cherrie-tree in each respect,\r\n    saving that the floures are somewhat double, that is to say, three\r\n    or foure times double; after which commeth fruit (though in small\r\n    quantitie) like the other common Cherry.\r\n\r\n    \"The double floured Cherry-tree growes up like unto an hedge bush,\r\n    but not so great nor high as any of the others, the leaves and\r\n    branches differ not from the rest of the Cherry-tree. The floures\r\n    hereof are exceeding double, as are the flours of Marigolds,\r\n    but of a white colour, and smelling somewhat like the Hawthorne\r\n    floures; after which come seldome or never any fruit, although\r\n    some Authors have said that it beareth sometimes fruit, which my\r\n    selfe have not at any time seen; notwithstanding the tree hath\r\n    growne in my Garden many yeeres, and that in an excellent good\r\n    place by a bricke wall, where it hath the reflection of the South\r\n    Sunne, fit for a tree that is not willing to beare fruit in our\r\n    cold climat.\"\r\n\r\nThese two are double-flowered cherries, several of which seem to have\r\nbeen grown as ornamentals. Both belong to _Prunus cerasus_ and as we\r\ngather rather better elsewhere than here, both are of the Amarelle type\r\nof tree.\r\n\r\n    \"The Birds Cherry-tree, or the blacke Cherry-tree, that bringeth\r\n    forth very much fruit upon one branch (which better may be\r\n    understood by sight of the figure, than by words) springeth up\r\n    like an Hedge tree of small stature, it groweth in the wilde woods\r\n    of Kent, and are there used for stockes to graft other Cherries\r\n    upon, of better tast, and more profit, as especially those called\r\n    the Flanders Cherries: this wilde tree growes very plentifully\r\n    in the North of England, especially at a place called Heggdale,\r\n    neere unto Rosgill in Westmerland, and in divers other places\r\n    about Crosbie Ravenswaith, and there called Hegberrie-tree: it\r\n    groweth likewise in Martome Parke, foure miles from Blackeburne,\r\n    and in Harward neere thereunto; in Lancashire almost in every\r\n    hedge; the leaves and branches differ not from those of the\r\n    wilde Cherry-tree: the floures grow alongst the small branches,\r\n    consisting of five small white leaves, with some greenish and\r\n    yellow thrums in the middle: after which come the fruit, greene at\r\n    the first, blacke when they be ripe, and of the bignesse of Sloes;\r\n    of an harsh and unpleasant taste.\r\n\r\n    \"The other birds Cherry-tree differeth not from the former in any\r\n    respect, but in the colour of the berries; for as they are blacke;\r\n    so on the contrary, these are red when they be ripe, wherein they\r\n    differ.\"\r\n\r\nThe cherries described in these two paragraphs, one black and one red,\r\n\"that bringeth forth very much fruit upon one branch\" and \"groweth in\r\nthe wilde woods\" and \"of an harsh and unpleasant taste\" are of course\r\nthe _Prunus padus_ of Britain and most of Europe--not a true cherry but\r\nthe racemose Bird Cherry, or Choke Cherry.\r\n\r\n    \"The common blacke Cherry-tree growes up in some places to\r\n    great stature: there is no difference between it and our common\r\n    Cherry-tree, saving that the fruit hereof is very little in\r\n    respect of other Cherries, and of a blacke colour.\"\r\n\r\nThis must be some wild Gean or Mazzard.\r\n\r\n    \"The dwarfe Cherry-tree groweth very seldome to the height of\r\n    three cubits: the trunke or body small, covered with a darke\r\n    coloured blacke: whereupon do grow very limber and pliant twiggie\r\n    branches: the leaves are very small, not much unlike to those of\r\n    the Privite bush: the floures are small and white: after which\r\n    come Cherries of a deepe red colour when they be ripe, of taste\r\n    somewhat sharpe, but not greatly unpleasant: the branches laid\r\n    downe in the earth, quickely take root, whereby it is greatly\r\n    increased.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have _Prunus fruticosa_ very well described.\r\n\r\n    \"My selfe with divers others have sundry other sorts in our\r\n    gardens, one called the Hart Cherry, the greater and the lesser;\r\n    one of the great bignesse, and most pleasant in taste, which we\r\n    call _Luke Wardes_ Cherry, because he was the first that brought\r\n    the same out of Italy; another we have called the Naples Cherry,\r\n    because it was first brought into these parts from Naples: the\r\n    fruit is very great, sharpe pointed, somewhat like a man's heart\r\n    in shape, of a pleasant taste, and of a deepe blackish colour when\r\n    it is ripe, as it were of the colour of dried bloud.\"\r\n\r\nGerarde's Hart is probably one of the Heart cherries, while \"Luke Wardes\r\nCherry\" is one of the oldest named Sweet Cherries known in England,\r\nhaving been mentioned by Parkinson and other of the herbalists as well\r\nas in this list.\r\n\r\n    \"We have another that bringeth forth Cherries also very great,\r\n    bigger than any Flanders Cherrie, of the colour of Jet, or\r\n    burnished horn, and of a most pleasant taste, as witnesseth\r\n    Mr. Bull, the Queenes Majesties Clockmaker, who did taste of the\r\n    fruit (the tree bearing onely one cherry, which he did eat; but my\r\n    selfe never tasted of it) at the impression hereof. We have also\r\n    another, called the Agriot Cherry, of a reasonable good taste.\r\n    Another we have with fruit of a dun colour, tending to a watchet.\r\n    We have one of the Dwarfe Cherries, that bringeth forth fruit as\r\n    great as most of our Flanders Cherries, whereas the common sort\r\n    hath very small Cherries, and those of an harsh taste. These and\r\n    many sorts more we have in our London gardens, whereof to write\r\n    particularly would greatly enlarge our volume, and to small\r\n    purpose: therefore, what hath beene said shall suffice. I must\r\n    here (as I have formerly done, in Peares, Apples, and other such\r\n    fruites) refer you to my two friends, Mr. _John Parkinson_, and\r\n    Mr. _John Millen_, the one to furnish you with the history, and\r\n    the other with the things themselves, if you desire them.\"\r\n\r\nOne can only roughly surmise as to what the cherries mentioned in this\r\nparagraph are with the exception of the Agriot which is, if the synonymy\r\nof several European pomologists be correct, the Griotte Commune, a sort\r\nsupposed to have been brought from Syria by the crusaders and to have\r\nbeen recorded under the last name in France as early as 1485.\r\n\r\nThe end of the Seventeenth Century saw a great revival of agriculture in\r\nall of its branches on the continent; in England the revival began with\r\nthe fall of the commonwealth. From this time the progress of cherry\r\nculture has been so rapid and so great that it would be an endless task\r\nto give even a cursory view of it--a task unnecessary, too, for\r\nsucceeding the herbalists a great number of botanies, pomologies and\r\nworks on agriculture were published to many of which reference is still\r\neasy. Moreover, the histories of varieties in this text carry us back\r\nquite to the beginning of the Eighteenth Century.\r\n\r\nThere now remains for the history of the cherry but to sketch its\r\nintroduction and culture in North America, an undertaking that can be\r\ndone briefly and to the point, for the data are abundant, recent and\r\nreliable. Here, too, accounts of the origin of varieties and the\r\ndevelopment of the cherry may be looked for in the chapters which\r\ncomprise the main part of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRIES IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nThe cherry was one of the first fruits planted in the fields cleared and\r\nenriched by our hardy American ancestry. From Canada to Florida the\r\ncolonists, though of several nationalities and those from one nation\r\noften representing several quite distinct classes, were forced alike to\r\nturn at once to the cultivation of the soil as a means of subsistence.\r\nAnd while in all of the colonies the early settlers must have been\r\nbusily engaged in the cultivation of cereals for the staff of life, in\r\nthe South in growing cotton and tobacco for money and for purposes of\r\nbarter, in the North in harvesting forest and fish products for\r\nbartering; yet the historians of the colonies notice so often and\r\ndescribe so fully and with such warmth of feeling the vegetables,\r\nflowers and fruits in the orchards and gardens of the New World that it\r\nis certain that the ground was tilled not only as a means of subsistence\r\nbut because the tillers loved the luxuries of the land.\r\n\r\nWhat fruit better adapted to the uses of colonists than the cherry? It\r\npossesses in a high degree, especially the Sour Cherry, the power of\r\nadaptation to new environment and thrives under a greater variety of\r\nconditions than any other of our fruits unless it be the apple, which it\r\nat least equals in this respect. The cherry is easily propagated; it\r\ncomes in bearing early and bears regularly; of all fruits it requires\r\nleast care--gives the greatest returns under neglect; and the product is\r\ndelectable and adapted to many purposes. We shall expect, then, in\r\nexamining the early records of fruit-growing in America to find the\r\ncherry one of the first planted and one of the most widely disseminated\r\nof fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRIES PLANTED BY THE FRENCH IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nWhile written records are lacking, the plantations of old trees and the\r\ndevelopment of cherry culture indicate that the French early planted\r\ncherries in Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island and in the\r\nearly settlements on the St. Lawrence River. The cherry is a favorite\r\nfruit of the French and the venerable trees that survived on the sites\r\nof their settlements when the English came into possession of Canada are\r\nproof sufficient that the émigrés from Provence or Normandy, fruit\r\ndistricts of France from which many French settlers came, brought with\r\nthem seeds of the cherry with those of other fruits. Peter Kalm in his\r\n_Travels into North America_ in 1771,[24] records the very general\r\nculture of all the hardy fruits in Canada and leaves the impression that\r\nsuch had been the case from the first settlements.\r\n\r\n    [24] Kalm, Peter _Travels into North America_ 1771.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRIES IN NEW ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe cherry came to New England with the first settlers. This we are told\r\nin all the records of early New England in which the conditions of the\r\ncountry are described and of it we have confirmatory proof in many\r\nenormous cherry trees, Sweet and Sour, both about ancient habitations\r\nand as escapes from cultivation in woods, fields and fence rows, all\r\npointing to the early cultivation of this fruit. The early records are\r\nvery specific. Thus, to quote a few out of an embarrassment of\r\nreferences: Francis Higginson writing in 1629, after naming the several\r\nother fruits then under cultivation in Massachusetts, notes that the Red\r\nKentish is the only cherry cultivated.[25] In the same year, the 16th of\r\nMarch, 1629, a memorandum of the Massachusetts Company shows that\r\n\"Stones of all sorts of fruites, as peaches, plums, filberts, cherries,\r\npear, aple, quince kernells\" were to be sent to New England.[26]\r\n\r\nThese seeds, provided by the home company with forethought of the need\r\nof orchards in the colony, evidently produced fruit trees sufficient to\r\nsupply both hunger and thirst; for John Josselyn, who made voyages to\r\nNew England in 1638, 1639 and 1663, writing of \"New England's Rarities\r\nDiscovered,\" says:[27] \"Our fruit Trees prosper abundantly, Apple-trees,\r\nPear-trees, Quince-trees, Cherry-trees, Plum-trees, Barberry-trees. I\r\nhave observed with admiration, that the Kernels sown or the Succors\r\nplanted produce as fair and good fruit, without grafting, as the tree\r\nfrom whence they were taken: the Countrey is replenished with fair and\r\nlarge Orchards. It was affirmed by one Mr. Woolcut (a magistrate in\r\nConnecticut Colony) at the Captains Messe (of which I was) aboard the\r\nShip I came home in, that he made Five hundred Hogsheads of Syder out of\r\nhis own Orchard in one year. Syder is very plentiful in the Countrey,\r\nordinarily sold for ten shillings a Hogshead.\r\n\r\n\"The Quinces, Cherries, Damsons, set the Dames a work, Marmalad and\r\npreserved Damsons are to be met with in every house. It was not long\r\nbefore I left the Countrey that I made Cherry wine, and so may others,\r\nfor there are good store of them both red and black. Their fruit trees\r\nare subject to two diseases, the Meazels, which is when they are burned\r\nand scorched with the Sun, and lowsiness, when the woodpeckers jab holes\r\nin their bark: the way to cure them when they are lowsie is to bore a\r\nhole in the main root with an Augur, and pour in a quantity of Brandie\r\nor Rhum, and then stop it up with a pin made of the same Tree.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as 1641, a nursery had been started in Massachusetts and was\r\nselling among other trees those of the cherry. Troublesome pests had\r\nmade their appearance, too, as may be seen from the following letter,\r\nprobably from the first American nurseryman. The letter is written by\r\nGeorge Fenwith of Saybrook, Connecticut, under date of May 6, 1641,[28]\r\nto Governor John Winthrop, Jr.\r\n\r\n    \"I haue receaued the trees yow sent me, for which I hartily thanke\r\n    yow. If I had any thing heare that could pleasure yow, yow should\r\n    frely command it. I am prettie well storred with chirrie & peach\r\n    trees, & did hope I had had a good nurserie of aples, of the aples\r\n    yow sent me last yeare, but the wormes have in a manner distroyed\r\n    them all as they came vp. I pray informe me if yow know any way to\r\n    preuent the like mischiefe for the future.\"\r\n\r\nThese early plantations of cherries in New England were undoubtedly\r\ngrown from seed; for buds, cions and trees could not have been imported\r\nunless the latter were brought over potted out as was not commonly done\r\nuntil a century and a half later--at least, the records make mention of\r\nseeds and not of trees as was the case just before and after the\r\nRevolutionary War. A statement left by one of the Chief Justices of\r\nMassachusetts, Paul Dudley, living at Roxbury, at as late a date as\r\n1726, indicates that varieties were few. In a paper in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_[29] on agricultural conditions in\r\nMassachusetts, among many other interesting things, Justice Dudley says:\r\n\r\n    \"Our apples are without doubt as good as those of England, and\r\n    much fairer to look to, and so are the pears, but we have not got\r\n    all the sorts. Our peaches do rather excel those of England, and\r\n    then we have not the trouble or expence of walls for them; for our\r\n    peach trees are all standards, and I have had in my own garden\r\n    seven or eight hundred fine peaches of the Rare-ripes, growing at\r\n    a time on one tree. Our people, of late years, have run so much\r\n    upon orchards, that in a village near Boston, consisting of about\r\n    forty families, they made near three thousand barrels of cyder.\r\n    This was in the year 1721. And in another town of two hundred\r\n    families, in the same year I am credibly informed they made near\r\n    ten thousand barrels. Our peach trees are large and fruitful, and\r\n    bear commonly in three years from the stone. Our common cherries\r\n    are not so good as the Kentish cherries of England, and we have no\r\n    Dukes or Heart cherries, unless in two or three gardens.\"\r\n\r\n    [25] _Mass. Hist. Soc.

The early Dutch settlers in New York were transient\r\ntraders and not home makers. Actual settlement with homes in view did\r\nnot begin until after the historical bargain in which thrifty Peter\r\nMinuit had acquired Manhattan Island for $24.00 and the country became\r\nNew Amsterdam. But troublesome times followed under the rule of Minuit,\r\nWouter Van Twiller and Kieft, quarrels and actual war, or the fear of\r\nit, with colonists to the north and south as well as with the savages,\r\npreventing the planting of orchards and farms until in 1647 when the\r\nreins of government were taken in hand by Peter Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\nGovernor Stuyvesant was a farmer as well as a soldier and there is\r\nsomething in history and much in tradition of the Bowery Farm, which\r\nflourished on the site of the present Bowery in New York. This farm was\r\nplanted and tended by \"Peter, the Headstrong\" when he was not disputing\r\nwith his burgomasters, watching the Yankees and fighting Swedes and\r\nIndians. The orchards and gardens, according to all accounts, were\r\nremarkably fine and were kept in a high state of cultivation. Stuyvesant\r\nfounded the farm during the stormy times of his governorship but did not\r\nlive on it until the English took possession of New Amsterdam in 1664\r\nwhen he retired to the land and devoted the eighteen remaining years of\r\nhis life to agriculture. From the neighboring colonies and from abroad\r\nhe brought many fruits, flowers, farm and truck crops. Fruits came to\r\nhim also from Holland and were disseminated from his orchard up the\r\nHudson.\r\n\r\nThe cherry was one of the fruits much grown by the Dutch. It would be\r\nwearisome and would serve little purpose even to attempt a cursory\r\nreview of the literature of colonial days in New York showing the spread\r\nand the extent of fruit culture by the Dutch. Travel up the Hudson and\r\nits branches was easy and within a century after the settlement of New\r\nYork by the Dutch, cherries were not only cultivated by the whites,\r\naccording to the records of travelers, naturalists and missionaries, but\r\nwere rudely tilled by the Indians.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after its introduction in New York, the cherry, in\r\ncommon with other fruits, was grown as a species--varieties and budded\r\nor grafted trees were probably not known. Fruit-growing as an industry\r\nbegan in New York and in America, with the establishment of a nursery\r\nat Flushing, Long Island, in 1730, by Robert Prince, founder of the\r\nnursery which afterwards became the famous Linnæan Botanic Garden. At\r\nwhat date this nursery began to offer named cherries for sale cannot be\r\nsaid but advertisements appearing in 1767, 1774 and 1794 show that\r\nbudded or grafted named cherries were being offered for sale by the\r\nPrinces. In 1804, William Prince, third proprietor of the famous\r\nFlushing nursery, prepared a list of the named cherries then under\r\ncultivation in America for Willich's _Domestic Encyclopaedia_, an\r\nEnglish work which was being edited and made \"applicable to the present\r\nsituation of the United States\" by Dr. James Mease. The following is\r\nPrince's list:[30]\r\n\r\n\"May Duke, ripe in May and June: long stem, round and red, an excellent\r\ncherry, and bears well.\r\n\r\nBlack Heart, ripe in June: a fine cherry.\r\n\r\nWhite Heart (or Sugar Cherry) ripe in June: white and red.\r\n\r\nBleeding Heart, ripe in June; a very large cherry of a long form and\r\ndark colour; it has a pleasant taste.\r\n\r\nOx Heart, ripe in June: a large, firm, fine cherry.\r\n\r\nSpanish Heart, ripe in June.\r\n\r\nCarnation, ripe in July, it takes its name from its colour, being red\r\nand white, a large round cherry, but not very sweet.\r\n\r\nAmber, ripe in July.\r\n\r\nRed Heart, do.\r\n\r\nLate Duke, do.\r\n\r\nCluster, planted more for ornament, or curiosity than any other purpose.\r\n\r\nDouble Blossoms, ripe in July.\r\n\r\nHoney Cherry, do. small sweet cherry.\r\n\r\nKentish cherry, ripe in July.\r\n\r\nMazarine, do.\r\n\r\nMorello, do. and August; a red, acid cherry, the best for preserving,\r\nand for making cherry-brandy.\r\n\r\nEarly Richmond Cherry. This fruit originated near Richmond in Virginia,\r\nand is the earliest cherry in America, and valuable on that account; it\r\nis the size of a May Duke, and resembles it in form.\r\n\r\nRed Bigereau, a very fine cherry, ripe in July, of a heart shape.\r\n\r\nWhite Bigereau, ripe in July and August: remarkably firm, heart shaped.\r\n\r\nLarge Double Flowering Cherry. This tree produces no fruit but makes a\r\nhandsome appearance in the spring, when it is covered with clusters of\r\ndouble flowers as large as the cinnamon rose; it differs from the\r\ncommon double flowering cherry which never forms a large tree, and has\r\nsmall pointed leaves.\r\n\r\nThe three last were imported from Bordeaux in 1798.\r\n\r\nSmall Morello Cherry, called also Salem Cherry, because it came\r\noriginally from Salem County, N. J., is cultivated by Mr. Cooper of that\r\nstate, who values it highly. The fruit has a lively acid taste. The tree\r\nproduces abundantly, and is the least subject to worms of any cherry\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nMr. C. says that the Bleeding Heart suits a sandy soil, but that the\r\nMay-duke will not flourish in it.\"\r\n\r\n     [30] Willich _Domestic Encyclopaedia_ 105. 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRIES IN THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting but hardly of sufficient profit to trace further\r\nthe history of cultivated cherries in the states of the Atlantic\r\nseaboard. References to the cherry abound in the colonial records of\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware but they bring out no facts\r\ndiffering materially from those abstracted from the records of the\r\nnorthern colonies. The Quakers and the Swedes in the states watered by\r\nthe Delaware and the English in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina,\r\nall early grew cherries as one of the easiest fruits to propagate and\r\ncultivate.\r\n\r\nSpace can be spared for but two brief quotations to show the condition\r\nof cherry culture in the South in Colonial days. The first is from\r\nBruce's Economic History of Virginia.[31]\r\n\r\n    \"In the closing years of the seventeenth century, there were few\r\n    plantations in Virginia which did not possess orchards of apple\r\n    and peach trees, pear, plum, apricot and quince.[32] The number\r\n    of trees was often very large. The orchard of Robert Hide of\r\n    York[33] contained three hundred peach and three hundred apple\r\n    trees. There were twenty-five hundred apple trees in the orchard\r\n    of Colonel Fitzhugh.[34] Each species of fruit was represented by\r\n    many varieties; thus, of the apple, there were mains, pippins,\r\n    russentens, costards, marigolds, kings, magitens and bachelors;\r\n    of the pear, bergamy and warden. The quince was greater in size,\r\n    but less acidulated than the English quince; on the other hand,\r\n    the apricot and plum were inferior in quality to the English, not\r\n    ripening in the same perfection.[35] Cherries grew in notable\r\n    abundance. So great was the productive capacity of the peach\r\n    that some of the landowners planted orchards of the tree for\r\n    the mere purpose of using the fruit to fatten their hogs;[36] on\r\n    some plantations, as many as forty bushels are said to have been\r\n    knocked down to the swine in the course of a single season.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThe second quotation is from Lawson's History of Carolina.[38]\r\n\r\n    \"We have the common, red and black cherry, which bear well. I\r\n    never saw any grafted in this country, the common excepted, which\r\n    was grafted on an indian plum stock, and bore well. This is a good\r\n    way, because our common cherry trees are very apt to put scions\r\n    all around the tree for a great distance, which must needs be\r\n    prejudicial to the tree and fruit. Not only our cherries are apt\r\n    to do so, but our apples and most other fruit trees, which may\r\n    chiefly be imputed to the negligence and unskillfulness of the\r\n    gardner. Our cherries are ripe a month sooner than in Virginia.\"\r\n\r\n    [31] Bruce _Economic History of Virginia_ =1=:468. 1895.\r\n\r\n    [32] Glover _Philo. Trans. Royal Soc._ 1676-1678, vols.

(Reprint of 1860.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRIES IN THE MIDDLE WEST\r\n\r\nAt a surprisingly early date the cherry, with the apple, peach, pear and\r\nplum, was being grown far inland in the New World. Southeastern Michigan\r\nwas settled in 1701 at Detroit and within a half-century settlements had\r\nbeen made at Vincennes, Indiana; Kaskaskia and Cahokia, Illinois; and at\r\nSaint Louis and several other points in Missouri. The orchards and\r\ngardens of the early French settlers in these states live in the\r\ntraditions of all the settlements; but much more substantial evidence\r\nwas to be found a century ago, and in the case of the apple and pear may\r\nstill be found, in the venerable trees of all the tree-fruit in and\r\nabout these old French posts. \"The homes of these pioneers,\" so good an\r\nauthority as Parkman tells us, \"were generally placed in gardens\r\nsurrounded by fruit trees of apples, pears, cherries and peaches.\" Were\r\nproof lacking of these early plantations, it might be assumed that\r\npeople so fond of horticulture as the French would not long be unmindful\r\nof the value to themselves and their posterity of plantations of fruit\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRIES ON THE PACIFIC COAST\r\n\r\nThe history of the cherry in America is not complete without some\r\nmention of its introduction, culture and the development of new\r\nvarieties on the Pacific coast. Indeed, it is not too much to say that\r\nat no time nor at any place in its whole history has the cherry made\r\ngreater advancement than during the last half-century in Oregon,\r\nCalifornia and Washington--naming the states in order of their\r\ncontribution to cherry culture.\r\n\r\nAt about the time the colonies were beginning their struggle with the\r\nmother country for independence, Franciscan monks were establishing\r\nmissions in California. To these they brought seeds of fruits, grains,\r\nflowers and vegetables, as several historians of the missions tell us,\r\nand as the trees found by Americans a few decades later make certain as\r\nregards fruits. It is probable that by the close of the Revolutionary\r\nwar all subtropical and temperate fruits of Europe were to be found\r\ncultivated in the missions of California. Among these, in an enumeration\r\nof the products of the missions, the cherry is listed by E. S.\r\nCapson.[39] From its introduction at approximately the close of the\r\nEighteenth Century, the cherry continued to be cultivated, at times more\r\nor less sparsely to be sure, until, by conquest in the war with Mexico,\r\nCalifornia passed into the possession of the United States. A new era in\r\nhorticulture began in California soon after the influx of gold-seekers\r\nin 1849, some of whom, noting the opportunities of fruit-growing, at\r\nonce began the importation of seeds and plants.\r\n\r\nModern fruit-growing on the Pacific Coast, however, began in Oregon. The\r\nCalifornia Argonauts of '49 were much too busily engaged in digging gold\r\nto think of getting it indirectly by tilling the soil, whereas the men\r\nwho were then crossing the plains from Missouri or sailing around the\r\nHorn from New England to Oregon were home-makers and true tillers of the\r\nsoil. These early Oregonians were the forerunners in the zeal and\r\nenterprise which have made horticulture on this coast the marvel of\r\nmodern agriculture. But one of the several early horticulturists of\r\nOregon can be mentioned here, he deserving special mention by virtue of\r\nhis work with cherries.\r\n\r\nUntil 1847 the few cultivated fruits to be found in Oregon were\r\nseedlings mostly grown by employees of the Hudson Bay Fur Company. In\r\nthat year there was a notable importation of cultivated fruits across\r\nthe plains--a venture which quickly proved pregnant with results in\r\nfruit harvests which have not ceased and give promise long to continue.\r\nHenderson Lewelling crossed the plains from Henry County, Iowa, and\r\nbrought with him a choice selection of grafted fruits. These he\r\ntransported in boxes of soil which he hauled in a wagon drawn by oxen.\r\nArriving in Oregon late in the fall of 1847 he found that he had 300\r\ntrees alive which he planted at what is now Milwaukee, a few miles south\r\nof Portland on the east side of the Willamette River. Later, seeds were\r\nbrought for stocks, though for the cherry the wild species, _Prunus\r\nemarginata_ and _Prunus virginiana_, were used and very successfully,\r\nuntil Mazzard and Mahaleb seeds could be obtained. In this travelling\r\nnursery, Lewelling brought to Oregon cherries of the Bigarreau, the\r\nEnglish Morello and probably of several other types. The label of one of\r\nthe cherries was lost and this unknown was renamed Royal Ann.\r\nUnfortunately, it was one of the best known of all cherries that for the\r\ntime being lost its identity--the Napoleon, which probably has been\r\ncultivated for three centuries and since 1820 has borne the name of the\r\ngreat General. With dogged perseverance the West Coast fruit-growers\r\ncontinue the name \"Royal Ann\" to the great confusion of systematic\r\npomology.\r\n\r\nBut of chief import to cherry culture were the subsequent operations in\r\nthe Lewelling nursery at Milwaukee. Lacking proper stocks, Seth\r\nLewelling, who had succeeded Henderson in the nursery business, grew a\r\ngreat many cherries from seeds. From these he afterward selected and\r\ndisseminated varieties that have made Oregon famous not only for what\r\nare probably the finest sweet cherries in the world but for a long list\r\nof new and desirable varieties--as Republican, Lincoln, Willamette\r\nSeedling and Bing. We call to mind no greater success in bringing into\r\nbeing new fruits from a few lots of seedlings than in the case of\r\nLewelling and his cherries. Lewelling's work stimulated others to breed\r\ncherries and among many seedlings that have since been named in the\r\nNorthwest the Lambert and Oregon are well worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nThe facts of time and place in the beginning of cherry culture which we\r\nhave tried to set forth in this chapter have, we think, some historical\r\nand narrative interest. Yet, the main value of the facts are not in\r\nhistory and story. Rather, at least so we hope they will be interpreted,\r\nthese brief records show what the crude material was out of which our\r\npresent cultivated cherry flora has been developed; what the steps were\r\nin the domestication and development of the cherry; what economic\r\npurposes they have served; and who the peoples are and what the methods\r\nwere in bringing the cherry to its present state of development. In a\r\nword, the chapter will not have served the purpose for which it is\r\nmainly intended if it does not furnish facts and inspirations toward the\r\nfurther evolution of the cherry.\r\n\r\n    [39] _History of California_ 111. 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nCHERRY CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the cherry industry in the United States is not\r\ngenerally appreciated. This is because cherries are very largely grown\r\nin small home plantations and the product is either consumed at home and\r\nin local markets, or is sent to canning factories and is therefore\r\ndisposed of without the display attending the production and marketing\r\nof fruits sold in the general market. The following figures from the\r\nlast census show the importance of the industry. There were in 1909,\r\naccording to the census taken in 1910, 11,822,044 bearing cherry trees\r\nin the United States and 5,621,660 trees not of bearing age. The bearing\r\ntrees bore 4,126,099 bushels of fruit valued at $7,231,160. When this,\r\nthe thirteenth census, was taken, the cherry ranked fifth in commercial\r\nvalue among orchard fruits, being surpassed in the order named by the\r\napple, peach, plum and pear.\r\n\r\nThe yield of fruit was 43.6 per centum greater in 1909 than in 1899.\r\nThis high percentage of increase has been brought about in several ways.\r\nThe recent development of rapid transportation, refrigerator service and\r\nof marketing facilities has greatly stimulated the culture of this as of\r\nall other fruits in the United States. An increased demand for canned\r\nand preserved cherries has sprung up so that cherries are much more used\r\nnow than formerly, the trade in preserved cherries for confections and\r\nvarious drinks in particular having greatly increased. Lastly, better\r\ncare of orchards and better means of combating insects and fungi have\r\nincreased the yields during the last decade.\r\n\r\nCherries are grown in greater or less quantities in every state in the\r\nUnion but commercially the industry is confined to a few states having\r\nespecial advantages in climate, soil and markets. In but six states,\r\naccording to the last census, was the value of the cherry crop more than\r\na half-million dollars, the states being: California $951,654,\r\nPennsylvania $909,975, Ohio $657,406, Michigan $590,829, New York\r\n$544,508, Indiana $508,516. In New York in particular, recent plantings\r\nof this fruit have been so great that at this writing, July, 1914, the\r\nfigures given for this State could be increased by a quarter at the very\r\nleast, and no doubt they could be largely increased also for California\r\nand Michigan. The great growth of the canning industry is most largely\r\nresponsible for the large plantings of cherries in recent years in\r\nregions especially suited to this fruit.\r\n\r\nIn the several states named, the cherry industry is further localized.\r\nThus, in the 61 counties in New York, the cherry is grown largely in but\r\n12, the number of trees in each of these being: Columbia 78,526, Niagara\r\n61,786, Monroe 49,831, Ontario 36,394, Wayne 35,385, Erie 29,483,\r\nOnondaga 25,932, Seneca 27,063, Chautauqua 24,483, Steuben 15,412,\r\nOrleans 14,682 and Cayuga 14,319. If the figures just given, the total\r\nnumber being 413,296, are compared with the number of trees in the\r\nState, 674,000, it will be seen that the industry is quite localized,\r\ntwo-thirds of the cherries being grown in 12 of the 61 counties, though\r\nthe fact is brought out in the census that cherries are grown on 59,408\r\nfarms in New York, showing that this fruit is much grown for home use.\r\nFurther figures of interest as regards New York are that the cherry crop\r\nin 1909 amounted to 271,597 bushels which sold for $544,508. The\r\nplantings in the State cover in the neighborhood of 9,500 acres.\r\n\r\nA canvass of the leading cherry-growers and nurserymen in the United\r\nStates shows that, in all parts of the country excepting California,\r\nOregon and Washington, Sour Cherries are much more commonly grown than\r\nSweet Cherries. In New York at least 90 per cent of the cherry trees are\r\nof sour varieties and this proportion will hold for the region east of\r\nthe Rockies. The leading commercial varieties of Sour Cherries, in order\r\nnamed, are Montmorency, Early Richmond and English Morello. No other\r\nvariety is nearly as commonly grown as is even the least well known of\r\nthese three. No one of the Duke cherries is mentioned as of commercial\r\nimportance, but May Duke, Late Duke and Reine Hortense are frequently\r\ngrown in home plantations.\r\n\r\nGrowers of Sweet Cherries are not nearly as closely in accord as to the\r\nbest varieties as are those who grow sour sorts. The most popular Sweet\r\nCherries in the East seem to be Windsor, Black Tartarian, Napoleon and\r\nWood with a very insistent statement of the few who have tried it that\r\nSchmidt is better than any of these for the market. On the Pacific Coast\r\nhonors go to Napoleon, which the Westerners continue to call Royal Ann\r\ndespite the fact that it has been cultivated for three centuries and had\r\nbeen called Napoleon for nearly a half-century before Lewelling took it\r\nto Oregon in 1847. Other popular sorts on the Pacific seaboard are Bing,\r\nLambert and Republican--all western productions.\r\n\r\nRather more important than the information obtained from growers of\r\ncherry trees as to varieties was that as to the stocks on which\r\ncherries are grown in America. This brings us to a discussion of the\r\nwhole subject of stocks for cherries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCKS FOR CHERRIES\r\n\r\nCherries have been grown in America for over 200 years and for 50 years\r\nthe crop has been important commercially. Yet despite the extent and the\r\nimportance of the industry and the years it has been in existence,\r\ncuriously enough so fundamental a question as the best stock upon which\r\nto grow cherries has not yet been settled; indeed, though cherries\r\nbehave markedly different on the several stocks, interest as to which is\r\nthe best seems but recently to have been aroused. Now there is a rather\r\nwarm controversy as to which is the better of the two leading stocks,\r\nthe Mazzard or the Mahaleb.\r\n\r\nFruit-growers on one side hold that the Mazzard is the best stock for\r\nall orchard varieties of this fruit while nurserymen controvert this\r\nview and say that the Mahaleb is at least a fit stock for sweet sorts\r\nand is the best one for Sour Cherries, and, moreover, that it is now\r\nimpossible to grow cherries on Mazzard roots at prices that\r\nfruit-growers are willing to pay. Since no systematic attempts seem to\r\nhave been made to determine the peculiarities and values of these two\r\nand other cherry stocks both sides dispute without many facts.\r\nMeanwhile, a fine crop of misunderstandings has grown up about the whole\r\nmatter of cherry stocks. It is worth while to attempt to clear up some\r\nof the misunderstandings. The first step toward this end is to describe\r\nand give the botanical and horticultural relationships of the Mazzard\r\nand Mahaleb cherries to orchard cherries.\r\n\r\nThe Mazzard, as we have seen, is a common name, of uncertain origin, of\r\nthe wild Sweet Cherry, _Prunus avium_, from which has come all\r\ncultivated Sweet Cherries. It is important to recall that the trees of\r\nthe Mazzard reach a height of thirty or forty feet and the trunk often\r\nattains a diameter of eighteen or twenty inches. Other characters to be\r\nkept in mind are that the Mazzard lacks hardiness to cold but grows\r\nvigorously and is usually healthy, though susceptible to several fungi,\r\none of which, the shot-hole fungus, _Cylindrosporium padi_, makes it a\r\nmost difficult plant to grow in the nursery. Trees and fruit coming from\r\nthe Mazzard used as a stock are very uniform, a fact easy to ascertain\r\nin New York where this stock has been largely used for nearly a century.\r\nThe Mazzard is almost always grown from seed for stocks though suckers\r\nare occasionally used--a poor practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS AVIUM_ (MAZZARD)]\r\n\r\nThe Mazzard, or at least the Sweet Cherry, has probably been more or\r\nless used as a stock since the earliest cultivation of this fruit. The\r\nGreeks and Romans practiced budding and grafting centuries before\r\nChrist's time and when the cherry came to them as a domesticated fruit,\r\nat least three or four centuries before Christ, they undoubtedly made\r\nuse of budding and grafting[40] to maintain varieties and in the case of\r\nthe Sour Cherry, if they had it, and they probably did, to avoid the\r\nsuckers that spring from the roots of the trees. The literature of\r\nfruit-growing is scant and fragmentary during the Middle Ages but\r\nbeginning with the herbals in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries\r\nthere are many treatises on fruits and botany and in several of these\r\nthe use of the wild Sweet Cherry, the Mazzard, is mentioned.[41]\r\n\r\nIn America the Mazzard as a stock probably came into use soon after the\r\nestablishment of Prince's nursery at Flushing, Long Island, about 1730,\r\nbudding and grafting seeming to have been little practiced in the New\r\nWorld before the founding of this nursery.[42] The use of the Mazzard as\r\na stock is mentioned probably for the first in Coxe's _Fruit Trees_,[43]\r\nthe second American treatise on fruits, published in 1817, and again in\r\nThacher's _American Orchardist_, published in 1822.[44] Both authors, as\r\nthe foot-notes show, speak of the use of this stock as if it were in\r\ncommon use in American nurseries. Neither mentions the Mahaleb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS AVIUM_ (MAZZARD)]\r\n\r\nThe Mahaleb, _Prunus mahaleb_, it will be remembered from the\r\ndescription previously given, is a bush or bush-like cherry, sometimes\r\nbut not often attaining the height and port of a tree. The top is thick,\r\nwith rather slender ramifying branches bearing small, green, smooth,\r\nglossy leaves, which resemble those of the apricot more than they do the\r\nleaves of either species of orchard cherries. The fruits are at first\r\ngreen, then yellowish, turning to red and at full maturity are shining,\r\nblack and so hard, bitter and astringent as to be scarcely edible. This\r\nbrief description of _Prunus mahaleb_ shows that it is quite distinct\r\nfrom either our commonly cultivated Sweet Cherry, _Prunus avium_, or the\r\nSour Cherry, _Prunus cerasus_, differing from either much more than the\r\ntwo edible species differ from each other. It is quite as far removed\r\nfrom the Sweet or the Sour Cherry botanically as the apple is from the\r\npear, the quince, or the thorn and if anything more distantly related\r\nthan orchard cherries are to plums. One would expect the wood structure\r\nof the Mahaleb to differ from that of Sweet or Sour Cherries very\r\nmaterially and that even if the union proved in budding or grafting\r\nwholly normal that there would be some difficulty in the proper passage\r\nof nutritive solutions between stock and cion. This cherry, as we have\r\nseen, is propagated almost entirely from seed though it may easily be\r\ngrown from layers, cuttings and suckers. The American supply of Mahaleb\r\nstock comes from France.\r\n\r\nThe Mahaleb seems to have come into use as a stock for other cherries\r\nin France having been first mentioned for this purpose by Duhamel du\r\nMonceau in his _Traite des Arbres Fruitiers_ in 1768.[45]\r\n\r\nMiller in his _Gardener's Dictionary_, 1754, describes the Mahaleb\r\ncherry and says it was \"Cultivated in 1714 by the Duchess of Beaufort.\"\r\nThis seems to be the first mention of its culture in England though\r\nGerarde in _The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes_ describes it.\r\nNeither mentions its use as a stock. In fact, it seems not to have been\r\nmentioned as a stock in England until 1824 when Loudon in the\r\n_Encyclopedia of Gardening_ speaks of it as \"the most effectual dwarfing\r\nstock.\"[46]\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the middle of the Nineteenth Century that the\r\nMahaleb came into use in America, none of the horticultural writers in\r\nthe first half of the last century, as Cobbett, 1803; McMahon, 1806;\r\nCoxe, 1817; Thacher, 1822; Prince, 1828; Kenrick, 1833; Manning, 1838;\r\nThomas, 1846; Floy, 1846, nor Cole, 1849, having mentioned the Mahaleb\r\nthough nearly all speak of the Mazzard as the stock upon which cherries\r\nare budded. Downing, in 1845, makes first mention of the Mahaleb as a\r\nstock in the New World;[47] Thomas in his second edition, 1851,\r\nrecommends it as a stock to dwarf cherries;[48] Barry, 1852, says that\r\nMahaleb stock is imported from Europe;[49] while Elliott, in 1854, also\r\nspeaks of it as a dwarfing stock.[50] From this date on the Mahaleb is\r\nmentioned in all American works on pomology in which stocks for cherries\r\nare discussed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS MAHALEB_]\r\n\r\nPains have been taken to show the exact date the Mahaleb began to be\r\nused as a stock in America. The quotations show that this was about\r\n1850. They show, too, that at first and for a long time its only use was\r\nas a dwarfing stock. But now the Mahaleb has almost wholly superseded\r\nthe Mazzard as a stock for all Sweet and Sour Cherries. Not many\r\ncherries were propagated on the new stock until after 1860 when its use,\r\nif we may judge from the accounts of fruit-growing, began to be general\r\nand it grew so rapidly in favor that by 1880 it was more popular than\r\nthe Mazzard and in another decade had almost wholly taken the place of\r\nthe latter. Probably 95 per centum of the cherries grown in this country\r\nare budded on the Mahaleb. Why has the Mahaleb supplanted the Mazzard?\r\nThis is the question that immediately comes to mind and to the\r\ndiscussion of which we proceed.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that it is much easier to grow cherry trees on\r\nMahaleb stock in the nursery than on Mazzard and that usually a better\r\nlooking tree can be delivered to the fruit-grower on the first-named\r\nstock. Seedlings of both stocks are imported from Europe and those of\r\nthe Mahaleb are usually cheaper. These reasons are sufficient for the\r\nexclusive use of Mahaleb by nurserymen, and, were it certain that the\r\nMahaleb is the best stock for the fruit-grower, all hands might\r\nforthwith renounce the Mazzard. In what respects is it easier to grow\r\ncherries on the Mahaleb in the nursery than on the Mazzard?\r\n\r\nAll know that the Sweet Cherry is a little difficult to grow--is\r\ncapricious as to soils, climates, cultivation and pruning, and as to\r\ndiseases and insects. The Mazzard now used for stocks has the faults of\r\nthe species to which it belongs. The Mahaleb, on the other hand, is\r\nadapted to a greater diversity of soils; is hardier to either heat or\r\ncold; less particular about cultivation; will stand more cutting in the\r\nnursery if pruning be necessary; is less susceptible to aphids which in\r\nmany parts of the United States trouble cherries in the nursery row;\r\nand, more to the point than all else, in New York at least, is not\r\nnearly as badly infested with the shot-hole fungus, _Cylindrosporium\r\npadi_, which often ruins plantations of Mazzard stock. Mahaleb stock,\r\ntoo, is more easily \"worked\" than the Mazzard both in the actual work of\r\nbudding and in having a longer season for this nursery operation.\r\nCherries on Mahaleb ripen their wood earlier than those on Mazzard and\r\nmay thus be dug earlier in the fall.\r\n\r\nNurserymen and fruit-growers alike agree to this statement of the\r\nsuperior merits of the Mahaleb as a nursery plant. The facts set forth\r\nare matters of common observation--so well known that it is not\r\nnecessary to verify them experimentally. A half-century of experience in\r\nAmerica on many soils, in many climates and under widely varied\r\nconditions has demonstrated that it is easier to grow cherries in the\r\nnursery on the Mahaleb than on the Mazzard stock.\r\n\r\nFrom experience in the orchard, fruit-growers have established several\r\nfacts as to the relative value of Mazzard and Mahaleb stocks from their\r\nstandpoint. These are:\r\n\r\n1. Cherries on Mahaleb are hardier to cold than those on Mazzard stocks.\r\nThis hardiness is due, in part at least, to the fact that cherry wood on\r\nMahaleb ripens sooner than on Mazzard. This superior hardiness of the\r\nMahaleb is evident in the nursery-row as well as in the orchard and is a\r\nmatter of great importance in northern nursery regions. In this\r\nconnection it should be said that the Mahaleb is not as hardy as might\r\nbe wished and that there are, as we shall later show, still hardier\r\nstocks.\r\n\r\n2. There is no question but that the Mahaleb is a dwarfing stock. It\r\ncame into use and in Europe continues to serve almost the sole purpose\r\nof dwarfing varieties worked upon it. This retarding effect is not fully\r\nrealized by American cherry-growers because for the first few years the\r\ndiminution in size is not apparent and even at the close of a decade the\r\ndifference in size is not as marked as it would be between standard and\r\ndwarf apples or pears of the same age.\r\n\r\n3. Cherry-growers who have tried both stocks agree that most varieties\r\ncome in bearing earlier on Mahaleb than on Mazzard stocks. From the\r\nknown effects of dwarfing on other fruit trees this would be expected.\r\n\r\n4. The size of the cherries is the same on trees grown on the two\r\nstocks. The claim is made that apples and pears are a little larger on\r\ndwarf trees and that when peaches and plums are dwarfed the fruit is\r\nsmaller. No one seems to have seen or to have thought that there are\r\ndifferences in the size of cherries grown on Mazzard or Mahaleb stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS AVIUM_ (MAZZARD)]\r\n\r\n5. Better unions are made with Mazzard than with the Mahaleb.\r\nThis would be expected because of the close relationship of the Mazzard\r\nto orchard cherries.\r\n\r\n6. The Mahaleb is probably the more cosmopolitan stock--will thrive\r\non a greater diversity of soils than the Mazzard stock. In particular it\r\nis somewhat better adapted to sandy, light, stony, and arid soils that are\r\nnot well adapted to growing cherries. Its root system is much nearer\r\nthe surface of the ground and it is, therefore, better adapted to shallow\r\nsoils than the Mazzard.\r\n\r\n7. Though the evidence is somewhat conflicting on this point it is\r\nprobable that cherries on Mazzard live longer than on Mahaleb. It may be\r\nthat the frequent statements to this effect arise from the knowledge\r\nthat dwarf fruit-trees are generally shorter lived than standard trees\r\nsince there seem to be no records of actual comparisons.\r\n\r\n8. Lastly, in climates where the cherry can be grown with reasonable\r\ncertainty and in soils to which this fruit is adapted, varieties on\r\nMazzard are more productive and profitable than on the Mahaleb stock.\r\nThis seems to be the concensus of opinion among growers in the great\r\ncherry regions of California, Oregon, Washington, Michigan and New York.\r\n\r\nSeveral other stocks have been more or less successfully used for\r\ncherries and a great number have never been tried that might make good\r\nstocks. In a country as diversified as ours and in a state as variable in\r\nsoil and climate as New York and with the manifold varieties of Sweet\r\nand Sour Cherries, it is almost certain that under some conditions there\r\nare stocks more desirable than either Mazzard or Mahaleb. The resources\r\nof the cherry-grower in this direction are so great that in this account\r\nwe can but briefly outline them, describing but a few of the many stocks\r\nthat might be used.\r\n\r\nIn the colder parts of New York and of the United States, undoubtedly\r\nseedlings of Russian cherries would make hardy and in most other\r\nrespects very desirable stocks. These Russian cherries, too, as a rule,\r\ncome nearly or quite true to seed, making very good orchard plants on\r\ntheir own roots. Some of them, if not most of them, sprout rather\r\nbadly--not so serious a fault as one might think, especially in a\r\ncultivated orchard. For budding over to other varieties only sour sorts\r\nshould be used, taking for trial such varieties as Bessarabian,\r\nBrusseler Braune, Double Natte, George Glass, Lutovka, Early Morello,\r\nOstheim and Vladimir. Probably most of these would dwarf standard\r\nvarieties more or less but in no case is it to be supposed that they\r\nwould have the dwarfing effect of Mahaleb. In the North Mississippi\r\nValley some of these, especially of the Ostheim or Morello type, have\r\nbeen very successfully used as stocks.\r\n\r\nThe small, wild, red cherry locally known as the Bird, Pin and as\r\nthe Pigeon Cherry, _Prunus pennsylvanica_, found from the Atlantic to\r\nthe eastern slopes of the Coast Range on the Pacific in northern United\r\nStates and southern Canada, is often used as a hardy stock. The writer\r\nhas seen it so used in northern Michigan but from his observation can\r\nrecommend it only for cold regions and as a makeshift since it dwarfs\r\nstandard varieties and usually suckers badly. W. T. Macoun, Ottawa,\r\nCanada, Dominion Horticulturist, states that this stock is commonly\r\nused in the colder parts of Canada and with good results. This cherry\r\nis not as distantly related to orchard varieties as the Mahaleb and unites\r\nwith Sour Cherries at least as readily as does the Mahaleb.\r\n\r\nIn the West and Northwest the Sand Cherry, _Prunus pumila_, is used\r\nvery successfully in cold, dry regions as a stock for Sour Cherries. The\r\nfollowing is a very good account of its behavior from the pen of the late\r\nProfessor J. L. Budd, a pioneer cherry grower in the Middle West.[51]\r\n\r\n    \"Those who have seen acres of the Sandy Cherry in the northwest\r\n    loaded with fruit have not been ready to believe it a good stock\r\n    for the cherry on account of its sprawling bushy habits of growth.\r\n    But those who have watched its growth when young under culture on\r\n    rich soil can comprehend the fact that it is as easy to work as\r\n    the Mahaleb. As with the Mahaleb the seedlings grown in seed bed\r\n    will be large enough to set in nursery row the next spring, and\r\n    of good size for August budding. To illustrate its rapidity and\r\n    uprightness of growth I will state that we rooted a few cuttings\r\n    in plant house last winter. When set in nursery they had made a\r\n    show of growth of from two to four inches, yet at budding time,\r\n    the middle of August, they were fully as large, stocky and upright\r\n    as the Mahalebs, and in all respects in as perfect condition for\r\n    budding.\r\n\r\n    \"This hardiest of all cherries is very closely related to our\r\n    garden cherries, so nearly indeed that our botanists long ago\r\n    decided that valuable crosses on it might be made.\r\n\r\n    \"As yet its use for stocks is somewhat experimental, but we\r\n    can say positively that it united well with our hardy sorts in\r\n    budding, and it does not dwarf the sorts worked upon it to a\r\n    greater extent during the first five years of growth than does the\r\n    Mahaleb.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS MAHALEB_]\r\n\r\nThere are records of the Choke Cherry, _Prunus virginiana_,[52] and of\r\nthe Rum, or wild Black Cherry, _Prunus serotina_, having been used as\r\nstocks but these long-bunch, or racemose, cherries are so distantly\r\nrelated to the short-bunch, or fascicled, orchard cherries that it would\r\nseem that their use would be desirable only under great stress.\r\n\r\nIn Japan a horticultural variety of _Prunus pseudocerasus_ is used as a\r\nstock. Of this cherry for this purpose, Professor Yugo Hoshino of the\r\nTohoku Imperial University at Sapporo, Japan, writes as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"You wish to know about the cherry stocks used in this country. It\r\n    is very rare to use our common wild cherry as a stock for European\r\n    cherries. In Hokkaido (Yozo Island), we commonly use the seedlings\r\n    of European Sweet and Sour Cherries as stocks. But in the northern\r\n    part of Japan proper (Main Island), it is a common practice to\r\n    graft European cherries on a special kind of our cherry. This\r\n    cherry has particular characters which fit it for propagation;\r\n    namely, it roots very easily either from cuttings or by layering\r\n    (mound). Its botanical position is not certain, but it is probable\r\n    that it is a cultural variety of Pseudocerasus, especially bred\r\n    for stock purposes. It is grown by nurserymen only and called\r\n    Dai-Sakura. (_Dai_ means stock: _Sakura_ means cherry.) It has a\r\n    somewhat dwarfing influence on cions and hastens their fruiting\r\n    age.\"\r\n\r\nThis stock ought to be tried in America if, indeed, it is not already\r\nunder cultivation from introductions made by the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of many cherries that have been or might be tried as\r\nstocks for orchard varieties. There are many species of cherries more\r\nclosely related to the cultivated edible sorts than the Mahaleb. Many of\r\nthe cherries from Asia, not now known to growers, will eventually find\r\ntheir way to America; a few have already been introduced by the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture; some of them can undoubtedly be used\r\nas stocks and from them we may hope to find a better stock than either\r\nthe Mazzard or Mahaleb.\r\n\r\nCherries are now grown almost wholly as budded trees but they can be\r\nmore or less readily root-grafted, depending upon the variety. Under\r\nsome circumstances it might be profitable to propagate them by grafting.\r\nUsually it is necessary to use a whole root and to graft at the crown of\r\nthe stock. Budd recommends this practice for Iowa, using Mazzard stock\r\nbut with the expectation that the cion will take root and eventually the\r\ntree will stand on its own roots.[53] We cannot believe, however, that\r\ngrafting can ever take the place of budding as a nursery practice or\r\nthat it can be profitably used except in very exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nBuds in propagating are usually taken from nursery stock, a practice of\r\ndecades, and there is no wearing out of varieties. Old varieties have\r\nlost none of the characters accredited to them a century, or several\r\ncenturies, ago by pomological writers. Nor does it seem to matter, in\r\nrespect to trueness to type, whether the buds be taken from a vigorous,\r\nyoung stripling, a mature tree in the heyday of life or some\r\nstruggling, lichen-covered ancient--all alike reproduce the variety. The\r\nhypothesis that fruit-trees degenerate or, on the other hand, that they\r\nmay be improved by bud-selection, finds no substantiation in this fruit.\r\nThere seems to be no limit to the number of times its varieties can be\r\npropagated true to type from buds.\r\n\r\n    [40] Varro (B. C. 117-27), as we have seen on page 47, tells\r\n    when to graft cherries and discusses the process as if grafting\r\n    cherries were a common operation.\r\n\r\n    [41] In _The Country-Man's New Art of Planting and Grafting_,\r\n    written by Leonard Mascall, 1652, the writer says, \"Sower Cherries\r\n    ... will grow of stones, but better it shall be to take of the\r\n    small Cions which do come from the roots; then plant them.\r\n\r\n    \"Ye must have respect unto the Healme Cherry, [a sweet cherry of\r\n    the time] which is graft on the wild Gomire [Mazzard] which is\r\n    another kind of great Cherry, and whether you do prune them or\r\n    not, it is not materiall; for they dure a long time.\"\r\n\r\n    R. A. Austen, in his _Treatise of Fruit Trees_, 1653, writes,\r\n    \"Concerning Stocks fit for Cherry-trees, I account the black\r\n    Cherry stock (Mazzard) the best to graft any kind of Cherry upon.\r\n    Yet some say the red Cherry stock is best for May-Cherries. But\r\n    the black Cherry stocks are goodly straight Plants full of sap and\r\n    become greater trees than the red Cherry trees.\"\r\n\r\n    John Reid, _The Scots Gard'ner_, 1683, writes, \"Dwarfe Cherries\r\n    on the Morella, or on the common Red Cherrie. Or on that Red geen\r\n    which is more Dwarffish than the black.\"\r\n\r\n    John Lawrence, _The Clergyman's Recreation_, 1714, declared that,\r\n    \"Black Cherries (Mazzard) are the only Stocks, whereon to raise\r\n    all, the several sorts of Cherries.\"\r\n\r\n    [42] \"The practice of grafting and inoculating in America is but\r\n    of modern date. It was introduced by Mr. _Prince_, a native of\r\n    New York, who erected a Nursery in its neighborhood about forty\r\n    years ago. But since the late American revolution, others have\r\n    been instituted in this and some other parts of the United States.\r\n    Mr. _Livingston_ has lately established one, not far from the city\r\n    of New York, which can vie with some of the most celebrated ones\r\n    in Europe. May he, and others, who have undertaken in that useful\r\n    branch of business, meet with encouragement and success. Nothing\r\n    in the extensive field of Horticulture can afford more agreeable\r\n    amusement or yield more solid satisfaction and advantage.\" Forsyth\r\n    on _Fruit Trees_, Albany, N. Y., =1803=:278.\r\n\r\n    [43] \"The cherry is propagated by budding and ingrafting--from\r\n    its disposition to throw out gum from wounds in the vessels of\r\n    the bark, the former mode is most generally adopted. The heart\r\n    cherries do not succeed well on any but the black Mazard stocks,\r\n    but round or duke cherries do as well on Morello stocks, which are\r\n    often preferred from their being less liable to the cracks in the\r\n    bark, from frost and sun on the southwest side; this injury may\r\n    be almost effectually prevented by planting on the east side of\r\n    board fences or buildings, or by fixing an upright board on the\r\n    southwest side of each tree in open situations.\r\n\r\n    \"The best stocks are raised from stones planted in the nursery.\r\n    Stocks raised from suckers of old trees, will always generate\r\n    suckers, which are injurious and very troublesome in gardens:\r\n    diseases of old or worn out varieties, are likewise perpetuated by\r\n    the use of suckers for stocks.\" Coxe _Fruit Trees_ =1817=:253.\r\n\r\n    [44] \"The cultivated cherry, when reared from the seed, is much\r\n    disposed to deviate from the variety of the original fruit, and,\r\n    of course, they are propagated by budding or grafting on cherry\r\n    stocks: budding is most generally preferred, as the tree is less\r\n    apt to suffer from oozing of the gum than when grafted. The stocks\r\n    are obtained by planting the seeds in a nursery, and the seedlings\r\n    are afterwards transplanted. Those kinds which are called heart\r\n    cherries are said to succeed best on the black mazard stock;\r\n    but for the round kind, the Morello stocks are preferred, on\r\n    account of their being the least subject to worms, or to cracks\r\n    in the bark, from frost and heat of the sun.\" Thacher _American\r\n    Orchardist_ =1822=:212.\r\n\r\n    [45] \"So the good species and their varieties are perpetuated and\r\n    multiplied by grafting upon the Merisier, upon the Cerisier with\r\n    round fruit, and upon the Cerisier de Sainte-Lucie [Mahaleb].\r\n    All the Cerisiers succeed well upon the Merisier and it is the\r\n    only subject which is suited to the high-headed trees. It has\r\n    the advantage of not sending forth any or very few suckers. The\r\n    Cerisier de Sainte-Lucie has the same advantage. It receives very\r\n    well the graft of all species of cherries and adapts itself to the\r\n    worst soils.\" Duhamel _Traite des Arbres Fruitiers_ =1=:197. 1768.\r\n\r\n    [46] \"Varieties of the cherry are continued by grafting or budding\r\n    on stocks of the black or wild red cherries, which are strong\r\n    shooters, and of a longer duration than any of the garden kinds.\r\n    Some graft on the Morello for the purpose of dwarfing the tree,\r\n    and rendering it more prolific; but the most effectual dwarfing\r\n    stock is the mahaleb, which, however, will not succeed in the\r\n    generality of soils in Britain. Dubreuil of Rouen recommends the\r\n    wild cherry for clayey and light soils, and the mahaleb for soils\r\n    of a light, sandy or chalky nature. The stones of the cultivated\r\n    cherry are commonly, but improperly, substituted for those of the\r\n    wild sort, as being more easily procured.\" Loudon _Enc. of Gard._\r\n    =1824=:924.\r\n\r\n    [47] \"When dwarf trees are required, the _Morello_ seedlings are\r\n    used as stocks; or when very dwarf trees are wished the Perfumed\r\n    Cherry, (Cerasus Mahaleb) is employed; but as standards are almost\r\n    universally preferred, these are seldom seen here. Dwarfs in the\r\n    nursery must be headed back the second year, in order to form\r\n    lateral shoots near the ground.\" Downing _Fruit Trees of America_\r\n    =1845=:164.\r\n\r\n    [48] \"The stocks used for this purpose (to dwarf cherries) are\r\n    the \"Perfumed Cherry\" or _Prunus Mahaleb_, which also possesses\r\n    the advantage of flourishing on heavy clay ground.

Fruit Cult._\r\n    =1849=:351.\r\n\r\n    [49] \"The principal stocks used for the cherry are the _mazzard_\r\n    for standard orchard trees, and the mahaleb for garden pyramids\r\n    and dwarfs.\r\n\r\n    \"The _Mahaleb_ (Cerasus mahaleb) is a small tree with glossy, deep\r\n    green foliage.

It is considerably cultivated in many parts of\r\n    Europe, as an ornamental lawn tree. There are very few bearing\r\n    trees in this country yet; consequently nearly all the stocks used\r\n    are imported, or grown from imported seeds.\" Barry _The Fruit\r\n    Garden_ =1851=:115, 117.\r\n\r\n    [50] \"_Dwarf Trees._--Are produced by propagating the Sweet or\r\n    Duke varieties on the Mahaleb, or Morello roots.

Book_ =1854=:185.\r\n\r\n    [51] _Iowa Sta. Bul._ =10=:425. 1890.\r\n\r\n    [52] _Prunus virginiana_ was used as a stock in Oregon in 1850 as\r\n    there were no other stocks available. The union was very good but\r\n    the stock was condemned because of suckering. Seth Lewelling _N.\r\n    W. Horticulturist_ Nov. 1887.\r\n\r\n    [53] \"I will here say that one year with another we succeed as\r\n    well in grafting on Mazzard roots as we do with pear on pear\r\n    roots, and nearly as well as with apple on apple roots. In some\r\n    cases since the appearance of the graft-box fungus our success\r\n    has been more complete with the cherry than with the apple. This\r\n    success is due to careful compliance with two main guiding rules,\r\n    founded on the nature of cherry wood: (1) Keep the scions dry\r\n    until used. If given an opportunity they will absorb water enough\r\n    to start the buds and form a callus at the base. In this condition\r\n    they will fail to unite with the root. (2) After grafting, pack in\r\n    boxes with sand or moss and store in a root cave, kept uniformly\r\n    cool by opening at night and keeping closed during the day. If\r\n    the buds start prior to the time of planting in nursery they will\r\n    usually fail to grow. It may prove useful to add, that the sprouts\r\n    from deeply set trees on Mazzard root will always be true to the\r\n    varieties planted, and the surface roots can be utilized for root\r\n    cuttings, as noted on a future page.\" _Ia. Sta. Bul._ =10=:424.\r\n    1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY CLIMATES AND CHERRY SOILS\r\n\r\nClimate and soil have been the chief determinants of location for\r\ncherry-growing in New York. Both Sweet Cherries and Sour Cherries are\r\nprofoundly influenced by the natural environment in which they are\r\ngrown--Sweet Cherries rather more so than any other fruit, either\r\nclimate or soil dictating whether they may or may not be grown.\r\n\r\nThe Sour Cherry is at home in a great variety of climates, the vagaries\r\nof weather affecting it but little. It is probably the hardiest to cold,\r\nin some of its varieties at least, of all our tree fruits, thriving\r\nalmost to the Arctic Circle and from there southward, in some of its\r\nforms, quite to the limits of the Temperate Zone. The blossoming season\r\nis relatively late so that fruit-setting is seldom prevented by spring\r\nfrosts. Yet, even with this hardy fruit, it is necessary to take thought\r\nof heat and cold in growing commercial crops; for spring frosts may\r\nwither the bloom or summer heat and wind blast the crop if the orchard\r\nsite be not well selected as regards local weather.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Cherry, on the other hand, must be coddled in every turn of\r\nthe season, in climatic requirements being particularly sensitive to\r\nheat and cold. This cherry stands with the peach in not being able to\r\nsurvive temperatures much below zero and in suffering greatly from\r\nspring frosts because of early blooming. It is even more susceptible to\r\nheat than the peach, and especially cannot endure long-continued heat,\r\nboth fruit and foliage suffering. The Sweet Cherry is at its best in a\r\nwarm, sunny, genial, equable climate. The Duke cherries, hybrids between\r\nthe Sweet and the Sour species, in the matter of hardiness are midway\r\nbetween the hardy Sours and the tender Sweets though this is but a very\r\ngeneral statement applying to the group as a whole and not to individual\r\nvarieties. Some of these withstand cold and heat well while others are\r\ntender in either extreme.\r\n\r\nCherries are more at the mercy of moisture than of temperature\r\nconditions. Continued rain at blossoming time will almost surely prevent\r\na proper setting of fruit; and the cherries crack, and brown-rot becomes\r\nexceedingly aggressive if there is wet weather in harvest time. Late\r\nsummer rainfall to supply moisture to the trees is a matter of small\r\nconcern to the cherry-grower, for growth begins early and the crop is\r\noff the trees before summer droughts usually begin. Where irrigation is\r\npracticed water for the cherry is safely supplied at most seasons of the\r\nyear except when harvest is in swing at which time the cherries will\r\nswell and crack if there be too much water.\r\n\r\nAs with all fruits the direction, temperature and humidity of winds are\r\nfactors which decree whether or not cherries can be grown profitably\r\neither in a locality or a region. A pocket in the hills filled with dead\r\nair or a wind-swept highland would be unsatisfactory extremes; for, in\r\nthe first case, fungi, especially the dreaded brown-rot, would take too\r\ngreat toll, and, in the second, blossoms would be blasted or foliage\r\nfrazzled and the fruit whipped. The harsh, drying winds of winter, too,\r\nwould be disastrous to Sweet Cherry culture and if extreme, as on the\r\nGreat Plains, wood and buds of Sour Cherries would suffer. Artificial\r\nwind-breaks have not been found profitable in the hilly and wooded East,\r\nentailing too many disadvantages, but if cherries be planted at all in\r\nthe prairies of the Middle West, some protection from the winds must\r\nusually be provided.\r\n\r\nThe two species from which cultivated cherries come grow with proper\r\nvigor in quite different soils. The Sour Cherry and most of its hybrid\r\noffspring, the Dukes, may be made to grow in almost any arable soil, but\r\nthe Sweet Cherry is fastidious--to be pleased only by particular soils.\r\n\r\nSour Cherry orchards in New York most excel on strong, even-tempered,\r\nloamy soils, naturally or artificially well drained yet retentive of\r\nmoisture. There is possibly a shade of difference in favor of clay loams\r\nand some thriving plantations may be found on stiff clays having good\r\ndepth and good drainage. Wet, sticky clays underlaid with a cold, clammy\r\nsubsoil--a combination all too common in Central New York--furnish\r\nconditions which defy the best of care and culture.\r\n\r\nSweet Cherry orchards are found excelling on lighter, and less fertile\r\nsoils than those we have described for the grosser feeding Sours.\r\nGrowers of Sweet Cherries conceive a perfect soil for this fruit to be a\r\nnaturally dry, warm, deep, free-working, gravelly or sandy loam. If the\r\nsoil is not naturally dry, it must be made so by artificial drainage,\r\nfor this fruit is most impatient of too much moisture or a root-run\r\nrestricted by water. In Sweet Cherry soils, as will be surmised, it is\r\ndifficult to supply humus yet this must be done either by cover crops or\r\nby manure to make the soil sufficiently retentive of moisture. Sweet\r\nCherries can be grown on other soils than those under discussion but,\r\nfor a large, firm, finely finished product for the markets, only the\r\nsoils described are suitable.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of soil and climate, as we have briefly defined them,\r\nthat favor cherry culture are to be found in several parts of New York.\r\nBriefly we may name and describe the cherry regions of the State as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe undulating, maritime plains of Long Island, covered with a thick\r\ndeposit of sand, are very well adapted to cherries where the soil is\r\nrich enough to come under the plow. The genial climate, with its rather\r\nheavy rainfall, is precisely that in which the cherry thrives, the\r\nregion falling short in the poorness of the soil--a fault easily\r\nremedied, where there is good bottom, by manuring. Despite the fact that\r\noccasional trees and plantations show that this fruit thrives on Long\r\nIsland the cherry is not much grown here, the industry needing some\r\nleader to show the way.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Hudson from where the river leaves the mountains on\r\nthe north to its entrance into the highlands of its lower stretch is\r\nadmirably adapted to cherry-growing, both climate and soil meeting the\r\nrequirements of this fruit. In parts of the valley the industry has been\r\ndeveloped, Columbia County taking first place among the counties of the\r\nState, with its 78,526 trees in 1909. The product of this region goes\r\nchiefly to the great city market near at hand. Unfortunately the\r\nstandard of cultivation is low in the Hudson Valley and the handling\r\nand marketing of the crop is also on a lower level than westward in the\r\nState. The cherry harvest is earlier here than elsewhere in New York, if\r\nwe except the small crop of Long Island, an advantage, for prices\r\nusually fall rather than stiffen as the season advances.\r\n\r\nThe great basin in which lie the Central Lakes of New York is far famed\r\nfor its Sour Cherry industry, the product going largely to canneries.\r\nSome Sweet Cherries are grown--more and more are being planted--about\r\nthese lakes; but the rich, heavy soils which mostly prevail hereabouts\r\nare more fit for varieties of the Sour Cherry; though the equable\r\nclimate makes almost certain the Sweet Cherry crop on soils suited to\r\nits culture. Here, as elsewhere in the State, the acreage at this\r\nwriting is greatly on the increase though it is doubtful if the advance\r\nwill much longer weather the present depression in prices. All through\r\nthis region, as in that to the north, the Sweet Cherry grows wild,\r\nthriving like the Biblical bay--seemingly a sheer gift of the soil and,\r\nlike other gifts, generally neglected.\r\n\r\nThe high plain along the shore of Lake Ontario from the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver to the Niagara River, extending from the lake on the north from\r\nten to fifteen miles inland, is the region of greatest possibilities for\r\nthe cherry in New York. The climate of this great stretch of territory\r\nis nearly perfect for this fruit and the soils are sufficiently\r\ndiversified to furnish a suitable habitat for any of the many varieties\r\nof either Sweet or Sour cherries. In the past there have been so many\r\nups and downs in the cherry industry that fruit-growers in this favored\r\nbelt have given more attention to other fruits but for the last decade,\r\nuntil the recent downward turn in the cherry market, the plantings have\r\nbeen greatly increased, both Sweet and Sour cherries finding favor.\r\n\r\nNot unlike the Ontario shore in climate, but quite unlike it in its\r\nsoils, is the shore of Lake Erie, the most westward topographical\r\ndivision of New York in which cherries are grown. The mainstay of this\r\nregion is the grape, but, in seeking for a more diversified agriculture,\r\nSour Cherry culture was introduced some twenty years ago and has become\r\na thriving industry with prospects of continued growth. Here, as is so\r\noften the case in agriculture, credit must be given to some one leader\r\nfor the development of a crop and the cherry orchards that dot the\r\nlandscape for miles about the home of the late John Spencer speak\r\neloquently of his leadership in this region.\r\n\r\nA necessary accompaniment to a discussion of climate is a statement of\r\nthe dates of blooming of the various sorts of cherries; for often,\r\nthrough selection with reference to this life event of the plant,\r\ninjurious climatal influences may be escaped at blooming-time. In the\r\naccompanying table averages of the blooming dates of varieties of\r\ncherries for the years just past, 1912 to 1914, are given.\r\n\r\nIn making use of these dates, consideration must be given to the\r\nenvironment of the orchards at Geneva. The latitude of the Smith\r\nAstronomical Observatory, a quarter of a mile from the Station orchards,\r\nis 42° 52' 46.2\"; the altitude of the orchards is from five hundred to\r\nfive hundred and twenty-five feet above the sea level. The soil is a\r\nstiff and rather cold clay; the orchards lie about a mile west of Seneca\r\nLake, a body of water forty miles in length and from one to three and\r\none-half miles in width and more than six hundred feet deep. The lake\r\nhas frozen over but a few times since the region was settled, over a\r\nhundred years ago, and has a very beneficial influence on the adjacent\r\ncountry in lessening the cold of winter and the heat of summer and in\r\npreventing early blooming.\r\n\r\nThe dates are those of full bloom. They were taken from trees grown\r\nunder normal conditions as to pruning, distance apart, and as to all\r\nother factors which might influence the blooming period. An inspection\r\nof the table shows that there is a variation of several days between the\r\ntime of full bloom of the different varieties of the same species. These\r\ndifferences can be utilized in selecting sorts to avoid injury from\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n  TABLE SHOWING BLOOMING DATES AND SEASON OF RIPENING\r\n\r\n

------------------+--------------------------------------+-----+------+----\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLLINATION OF CHERRIES\r\n\r\nWe cannot complain in New York of much uncertainty in the setting of the\r\ncherry crop. Late spring frosts occasionally catch the blossoms of Sweet\r\nvarieties but seldom those of the Sour sorts. Cold weather, especially\r\nif accompanied by wet weather, not unfrequently cuts short the cherry\r\ncrop by preventing proper setting. There is, however, no general\r\ncomplaint of poor crops through self-sterility. In fact from the\r\nbehavior of perfectly isolated trees in all parts of the State it would\r\nbe premised that the cherry is most nearly self-fertile of all\r\ntree-fruits.\r\n\r\nYet there may be orchards or seasons in which cross-pollination cuts a\r\nfigure, for Gardner[54], of the Oregon Station, found in experiments\r\ncarried on by him in various parts of Oregon that many varieties of\r\nSweet Cherries in the Pacific Coast environment are self-sterile. The\r\nwork seems to have been very carefully done and the conclusions are\r\nworth reprinting in full, bearing in mind that they would be much\r\nmodified under New York conditions. Gardener found:\r\n\r\n    \"1. All the varieties of the Sweet Cherry tested are self-sterile.\r\n    This self-sterility is in no case due to a lack of germinability\r\n    of the pollen produced. On the other hand, the pollen of each\r\n    of the varieties studied is capable of producing a set of fruit\r\n    on the variety or varieties with which it is inter-fertile. The\r\n    list includes Bing, Black Republican, Black Tartarian, Coe, Early\r\n    Purple, Elton, Knight, Lambert, Major Francis, May Duke, Napoleon,\r\n    Rockport, Waterhouse, Willamette, Windsor, Wood.\r\n\r\n    \"2. Certain of these varieties--Bing, Lambert, and Napoleon are\r\n    mentioned especially--are inter-sterile. Mixed plantings of\r\n    these three varieties cannot be expected to set fruit unless the\r\n    trees are within the range of influence of some other variety or\r\n    varieties that are inter-fertile with them.\r\n\r\n    \"3. Among those studied, Black Republican, Black Tartarian, and\r\n    Waterhouse seem to be the most efficient pollenizers for this\r\n    group of varieties.\r\n\r\n    \"4. Other good pollenizers that may be mentioned are: Elton, Wood,\r\n    Coe, Major Francis, Early Purple. These, however, proved somewhat\r\n    variable in their pollenizing abilities.\r\n\r\n    \"5. _Some_ of the seedling trees found in and about cherry\r\n    orchards are efficient pollenizers for the three varieties--Bing,\r\n    Lambert, Napoleon. Probably _many_ of these seedling trees are\r\n    efficient pollenizers, though the value of any particular seedling\r\n    can be determined only by experiment or very careful observation.\r\n\r\n    \"6. At least some members of the Duke group of cherries are\r\n    capable of pollinating some of the Bigarreaus.\r\n\r\n    \"7. At least some of the varieties of the Sour Cherry (P. cerasus)\r\n    are capable of pollinating some of the Bigarreaus.\r\n\r\n    \"8. Inter-sterility of Sweet Cherry varieties is apparently not\r\n    correlated with their closeness of relationship.\r\n\r\n    \"9. The ability of a variety of cherry to set fruit is\r\n    not entirely dependent upon the kind of pollen available.\r\n    Environmental factors are important.\"\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if New York cherry-growers will need to pay much\r\nattention to cross-pollination but, in case cherry trees are not setting\r\nfull crops, and for no other apparent reason, the fertility of the\r\nblossoms may well receive attention. Should varieties be found\r\nself-sterile, sorts must be chosen which come into blossom at the same\r\ntime, in which case the preceding table shows the sorts which bloom\r\ntogether or nearly enough so to make cross-pollination possible.\r\n\r\n    [54] Gardner, V. R. Pollination of the Sweet Cherry, _Ore. Sta.\r\n    Bul_. =116=:36. 1913\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY ORCHARDS AND THEIR CARE\r\n\r\nIt is patent to the eye of every passer-by that cherry trees are\r\ncommonly set too thickly in most of the orchards in New York. While\r\nclose planting is a universal fault, the amount of room differs greatly\r\nin different cherry centers, depending mostly upon the custom in the\r\ncommunity, though, as all confess, it should depend upon the variety and\r\nthe soil. The very erroneous notion seems to have prevailed in setting\r\nthe plantations now reaching maturity that a large return could be\r\nskimmed from a small area by close setting, Sour Cherries often being\r\nput only twelve feet apart each way and Sweet Cherries, considering\r\ntheir great size, even closer, at sixteen feet. Experienced growers now\r\nput such dwarf kinds as the Morellos at from sixteen to eighteen, the\r\nMontmorencies and their kind at eighteen to twenty-two; and the large\r\ngrowing Sweet Cherries at from twenty-four to thirty feet.\r\n\r\nCherries are usually planted two years from the bud. Spring is the\r\nseason for setting, though the hardy Sour sorts might often be set\r\nadvantageously in late autumn. The losses at setting time are greater\r\nwith the cherry than with any other fruit, old hands in fruit-growing\r\nlosing trees as well as beginners. An experiment at the Station shows\r\nthat these losses are greatly mitigated by a change in the usual method\r\nof transplanting. The custom is to shorten-in all branches of\r\ntransplanted fruit-trees but this, with the cherry in particular,\r\nremoves the largest and presumably the best nourished buds--certainly\r\nthose from which would soonest develop the leaves so necessary to\r\nsustain the breath of life in the young plant and to give it a start. In\r\nthe experiment at this Station it was found that, if the top of the\r\nyoung tree was reduced by thinning the branches instead of cutting all\r\nback, a much larger proportion of the trees would strike root and live\r\nthrough our parching summers.\r\n\r\nCherry trees in the past have been headed three or four feet above the\r\nground but in new plantations they are now usually started lower--at\r\nhalf of the above distances. Two forms of top are in vogue, the\r\nspire-shape and the vase-shape. Sour Cherries are almost universally\r\ngrown with closed centers but some growers prefer the form of the vase\r\nfor Sweet varieties, though the majority hold to trees with central\r\ntrunks and many subsidiary branches. Little pruning is done in cherry\r\norchards after the first two or three years, by which time the sapling\r\nhas been shaped. Subsequent pruning consists in removing dead, injured\r\nor crowded branches and an occasional superfluous one. Heading-in finds\r\nlittle favor with experienced growers. These few statements indicate\r\nthat the cherry, as now grown, is pruned but little, and that that\r\nlittle must be done very carefully, the pruning knife in the hands of a\r\ncareless man being, with this fruit, \"a sword in the hands of a child.\"\r\n\r\nThe general tuning-up in the cultivation of fruits during the past\r\nquarter-century has had its influence on cherry culture. Commercial\r\norchards are no longer kept in sod and the clean, purposeful cultivation\r\nthat has taken the place of grass has doubled the output of cherries,\r\ntree for tree, throughout the State, the difference in yield being\r\nespecially noticeable in seasons when drought lies heavy on the land.\r\nCultivation, as practiced by the best growers, consists of plowing the\r\nland in the spring and then frequently stirring the soil until the first\r\nof August, at which time a cover-crop is sown. If the soil is light, and\r\ntherefore hungry and thirsty, the plowing should be done early and the\r\ncultivator kept constantly at work until cherry-picking. Cherry orchards\r\noften, without apparent cause, have an indefinable air of malaise--look\r\ndingy and unhappy--such require almost week-to-week cultivation to tide\r\nthem over their period of indisposition.\r\n\r\nGrain, as well as grass, is discountenanced in cherry orchards, but\r\ncultivated truck and farm crops in young plantations, or, under some\r\nconditions, small fruits, are looked upon as permissible and often pay\r\nfor the keep of the young trees until they come into profitable\r\nbearing. Cover-crops are in common vogue in cherry orchards in New York\r\nand, since with this fruit they can be sown earlier in the season, are\r\nused to better advantage than in other orchards to furnish a full supply\r\nof humus and to provide nitrogen. Brown-rot, an annual scourge in most\r\ncherry orchards, takes less toll from trees cultivated and\r\ncover-cropped, these operations covering the mummied fruits and keeping\r\nthe spores they carry from coming to light and life.\r\n\r\nCherry growers as a rule are not now using fertilizers for their crops.\r\nIt would seem that this is not doing duty by the land; but it must be\r\nremembered that the cherry grows vigorously and that over-feeding may\r\nstimulate the growth too much, laying the orchard open not only to\r\nunfruitfulness but to winter injury of bud and tree. Among those who use\r\nfertilizers there is little accord as to what fertilizing compounds are\r\nbest or as to what the results have been. There is common agreement,\r\nhowever, that Sour Cherries respond more generally to fertilizers than\r\nthe Sweet sorts. Until there are carefully carried out fertilizer\r\nexperiments with this fruit the vexatious problems of fertilization\r\ncannot be solved. Nitrate of soda seems to be a great rejuvenator in\r\norchards laid down to grass. Whatever the cause, when leaves lack color\r\nand hang limp, this fertilizer is a sovereign tonic. Heavy dressings of\r\nstable manure are much used in grassed-over orchards, as they are, also,\r\nin such as have had none or but scant crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMERCIAL STATUS OF CHERRY-GROWING IN NEW YORK\r\n\r\nCherry growing is a specialist's business in which, under the best of\r\nconditions, there are more ups and downs than with other fruits. Because\r\nof the great profits that have come to a few in the years just past many\r\ngrowers have been drawn into the business in a small way or have planted\r\nan acreage beyond their means to manage. The inevitable depression that\r\nfollows over-planting is, at this writing, at hand and spells ruin to\r\nsome and disgust and discouragement in the industry to others. Perhaps\r\nno fruit can better be left to men of reserve capital than the cherry,\r\nand even with men of substance cherry-growing should largely be\r\nincidental to the culture of other fruits--an industry to fit in to keep\r\nland, labor and machinery employed.\r\n\r\nCherry trees begin to bear in the climate of New York when set from\r\nthree to five years. The varieties of _Prunus cerasus_ first produce\r\nprofitable crops but, at from six to eight years from setting, both\r\nSweet and Sour sorts are in full swing as money-making crops. The\r\nlimits of profitable age are not set by the life of the tree but,\r\nrather, by its size. Thus, cherry trees of either of the species\r\ncommonly cultivated are not infrequently centenarians but the profitable\r\nage of an orchard is not often more than from thirty to forty years.\r\nAfter this time the trees become large and the expense of caring for\r\nthem and of picking the fruit becomes so great as to prevent profits.\r\nMoreover, disease, injuries and inevitable accidents will have thinned\r\nthe ranks of trees until the orchard is below profit-making.\r\n\r\nCherry-picking begins in New York about the first of July, following the\r\nrush in harvesting strawberries, and lasts, if the orchard contains both\r\nSweet and Sour varieties, from four to six weeks. Workers may in this\r\nway fill in a gap between small-fruits and other tree-fruits and the\r\ncrop becomes one in which the grower may often take small profits to\r\nkeep his help employed; though, in the long run, if the more or less\r\nfrequent depressions can be weathered, the cherry may prove as\r\nprofitable as other fruits.\r\n\r\nThe problem of labor is a most vexatious one under present conditions,\r\nit being impossible to obtain casual men laborers for cherry-picking and\r\nwomen and children are unsatisfactory, since the fruit must be carefully\r\npicked or both cherries and trees suffer. The problem is solved,\r\nunsatisfactorily in most cases, in various ways by different growers.\r\nMost of the crop is now picked by children in the teens under the eyes\r\nof men or women supervisors. In picking for the market the stem is left\r\non and only the stem is touched by the fingers. Cherries for canning\r\nfactories are less laboriously picked. The picking package is usually an\r\neight-pound basket. The rate paid is one cent per pound. Pickers earn\r\n$1.50 to $2.00 per day in good seasons. Close watch is kept on pickers\r\nto prevent the breaking off of fruit-spurs, thereby destroying the\r\nsucceeding year's crop, varieties fruiting in clusters suffering\r\nespecially from carelessness in this respect. Cherries are picked a few\r\ndays before full ripeness.\r\n\r\nCherries are sent to canneries in various packages but chiefly in\r\nhalf-bushel baskets or paper-lined bushel crates, the container being\r\noften supplied by the cannery. The six- and eight-pound baskets are the\r\nfavored receptacles for Sour Cherries in city markets but the Sweet\r\nsorts are rather oftener sent in four-pound baskets and still more\r\nfrequently in quart boxes. In the larger packages not much effort is\r\nmade to make the fruit attractive but in the smaller ones, stemless and\r\nbruised cherries are thrown out and the package filled, stem down, with\r\nthe best fruits. In fancy grades all of the fruit in the box is layered.\r\nThe demands of the market, of course, determine the package and the\r\nmanner of packing. Cherries are seldom stored longer than a few days at\r\nmost in common storage and a week or two weeks in cold storage.\r\n\r\nThere is a marked difference in the shipping and keeping qualities of\r\nvarieties of cherries, the sorts that keep longest and ship best, quite\r\nat the expense of quality, having the call of the markets. Undoubtedly\r\nthis must remain so, though it is to be desired that local markets, at\r\nleast, be supplied with the best, irrespective of handling qualities. A\r\nfurther factor that prevents the placing of choicely good cherries in\r\ndistant markets at all times is brown-rot, to be discussed later, which\r\nmore often attacks the juicy and usually the best-flavored varieties,\r\noftentimes ruining the pack on the way to market--one of the most\r\ndiscouraging events incidental to cherry-growing.\r\n\r\nMarketing machinery for cherries is at present very costly, inadequate\r\nand frequently sadly out of gear. The fruit passes first from the grower\r\nto a local buyer who ships to a center of consumption, transportation\r\ncompanies taking heavy toll on the way. Jobbers or commission companies,\r\nwho in some cases receive the fruit direct from the grower, then\r\ndistribute the crop to retailers in the consuming centers. Lastly, the\r\nretailer parcels out the quantities and the qualities demanded by the\r\nhousewife. The whole business of selling the crop is speculative and the\r\ngrower is fortunate to receive half of what the consumer pays and not\r\ninfrequently has all of his pains for nothing or may even be forced to\r\ndip into his pocket for transportation. The perishableness of the\r\nproduct and the present defects of distribution go far to make the crop\r\nthe hazardous one it is but all look forward to better times coming\r\nunder an improved system of marketing.\r\n\r\nUp to the present, it must be said, but little effort has been made in\r\nNew York to ship far and to develop a trade in cherries other than at\r\nthe canneries. The canners have until the last year or two taken the\r\ncream of the crop but with recent greatly increased plantings are now\r\nover-supplied. The average grower, possessing a mixture of mental\r\ninertia and business caution, has not sought other sources for the\r\nsurplus fruit. Bolder and more energetic spirits are now developing new\r\nmarkets and opening up those to which other tree-fruits more generally\r\ngo so that the present over-production may prove a blessing in disguise.\r\nThe greatly increased demand, for Sour Cherries in particular, brought\r\nabout by the development of markets in 1913-14, are most hopeful signs\r\nfor the future of the cherry industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY DISEASES\r\n\r\nCherries, without preventive or remedial intervention, are at the mercy\r\nof two or three fungus diseases and sometimes several others are\r\nvirulent, depending upon locality, season, weather and variety. One of\r\nthese diseases, brown-rot, in spite of the great advances in plant\r\npathology of recent years, is almost beyond the control of preventive or\r\nremedial measures. Happily, all the others yield better to treatment.\r\n\r\nBrown-rot[55] (_Sclerotinia fructigena_ (Persoon) Schroeter), sometimes\r\nknown as fruit-mold or ripe-rot, very frequently attacks flowers and\r\nshoots but is most conspicuous on the ripe or ripening cherries where\r\nits presence is quickly detected by a dark discoloration of the skin\r\nwhich is afterwards partly or wholly covered with pustule-like\r\naggregations of gray spores. The decayed fruits usually fall to the\r\nground but sometimes hang to the tree, becoming shriveled mummies, each\r\nmummy being a storehouse of fungus threads and spores from which\r\ninfestation spreads to the next crop. The disease, in some seasons, like\r\na withering blight, attacks twigs, flowers and leaves early in the\r\nspring doing great damage to the young growth and often wholly\r\npreventing the setting of fruit. The rot spreads with surprising\r\nrapidity on the fruits in warm, damp weather either before the fruit is\r\npicked or in baskets while being shipped or stored. Preventive remedies\r\nhave so far met with but indifferent success; probably the best method\r\nof control is to destroy the mummy-like fruits and all other sources of\r\ninfection either by picking them from the trees, or much better by\r\nplowing them under deeply. Varieties of cherries show various degrees of\r\nsusceptibility to brown-rot. All Sweet Cherries are more subject to the\r\ndisease than the Sour sorts. But with either of the two species there\r\nare great variations in the susceptibility of the varietal hosts--a\r\nmatter specially noted in a later chapter in the discussion of\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nAnother serious disease of the cherry, and probably the most striking\r\none in appearance, is the black-knot[56] (_Plowrightia morbosa_\r\n(Schweinitz) Saccardo), characterized by wart-like excrescences on\r\nshoots and branches. Black-knot looks more like the work of an insect\r\nthan a fungus and was long supposed to be such even by those who were\r\nstudying the trouble. The knots begin to form early in the summer and\r\nare of characteristic color and texture--dark green, soft and velvety,\r\nbut in the fall, as the fungus ripens, the color changes to coal-black\r\nand the knots become hard and more or less brittle. The excrescences\r\nusually form on one side of a twig or branch so that death seldom\r\nfollows quickly. The disease attacks both wild and cultivated plants in\r\nevery part of this continent where cherries are grown but is epidemic\r\nonly in the East, the cherry regions of the West being practically free\r\nfrom the disease. Up to the present time the fungus has not been found\r\nelsewhere than in America. Happily, black-knot may be controlled by\r\ncutting out the diseased wood. To completely eradicate the fungus, if it\r\nis especially virulent, however, the orchard must be gone over several\r\ntimes during a season. In New York the removal of black-knot is ordered\r\nby law, the results showing that when the law is obeyed, especially if\r\nthere be hearty co-operation among growers, eradication is usually\r\npossible. Sweet Cherries are much less attacked by black-knot than the\r\nSour sorts but the differences in immunity between varieties in either\r\nof the two species are not very marked--at least such is the case on the\r\ngrounds of this Station where the disease is always present and is often\r\nvery prevalent.\r\n\r\n_Exoascus cerasi_ Fuckel[57] is the cause of a very striking deformity\r\nof the cherry in Europe, both _Prunus avium_ and _Prunus cerasus_ being\r\nattacked. The disease has been reported in America but has not yet\r\nbecome virulent. The fungus attacks the branches, causing a clustering\r\nof the twigs in the form of a broom, giving it the name witches' broom.\r\nThe leaves on the diseased twigs usually take on a crinkled shape and a\r\nreddish color. The malady may be readily prevented by the destruction of\r\naffected branches.\r\n\r\nIn common with other species of Prunus the foliage of cherries\r\nis attacked by several fungi which produce diseased spots on\r\nthe leaves, the dead areas usually dropping out leaving holes as\r\nif punctured by shot. Thus we have \"shot-hole fungus,\" \"leaf-spot\"\r\nand \"leaf-blight\" as effects of these diseases. Three fungi are in the\r\nmain responsible for these leaf troubles; these are _Cylindrosporium\r\npadi_ Karsten,[58] _Mycosphærella cerasella_ Aderhold[59] and\r\n_Cercospora circumscissa_[60] Saccardo. The ravages of these fungi are\r\nprevented by the proper use of bordeaux mixture and lime and sulphur,\r\nremedies which, however, must be used with some care to avoid spray\r\ninjury. With these, as with other fungi, cultivation has a salutary\r\neffect as it destroys diseased leaves which harbor the fungi during\r\ntheir resting period.\r\n\r\nCherry leaves are often covered with a grayish powder which in severe\r\ncases causes them to curl and crinkle and sometimes to drop. This\r\npowdery substance consists of the spore-bearing organs of a mildew[61]\r\n(_Podosphæra oxyacanthæ_ De Bary). Powdery mildew is much more common on\r\nnursery stock than on fruiting trees and in New York is a serious pest\r\non young cherry trees. In the nursery, injury may be prevented by the\r\nuse of copper sprays or lime and sulphur, either of which is also an\r\nefficient preventive in the orchard but the mildew is seldom prevalent\r\nenough on orchard plants to require treatment.\r\n\r\nWherever cherries are grown in either the nursery or orchard, crown\r\ngall[62] (_Bacterium tumefaciens_ Smith and Townsend) has obtained a\r\nfooting. In the North at least, it seldom greatly injures old trees, but\r\nif the galls girdle a nursery plant serious injury results. Therefore,\r\nbadly infected young trees showing galls should not be planted. However,\r\nbut little harm is liable to result under most conditions. When infected\r\nplants have been planted it has been found that galls vary greatly in\r\nduration, sometimes disappearing within a year or two and at other times\r\npersisting indefinitely. The tumor-like structures are usually at the\r\ncollar of the plant and vary from the size of a pea to that of a man's\r\nfist, forming at maturity rough, knotty, dark-colored masses. Neither\r\nprevention nor cure has been discovered, though it is known that soils\r\nmay be inoculated with the disease from infected stock and that,\r\ntherefore, diseased trees should not be planted in soils virgin to the\r\ngalls. It is probable that there are differences in the susceptibility\r\nof Sweet and Sour cherries to the fungus and that the varieties of the\r\ntwo species vary in their resistance but as yet no one seems to have\r\nreported on the differences in susceptibility of cherries to the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-rust[63] (_Puccinia pruni-spinosæ_ Persoon) of stone-fruits,\r\noccurring rarely on the fruit, sometimes attacks cultivated cherries and\r\nis a rather common disease of the wild _Prunus serotina_. This rust is\r\ntroublesome only, however, in warm, moist climates. It is most apparent\r\nin the fall and is easily recognized through its numerous rust-colored\r\nsori on the underside of the leaves. Defoliation takes place in severe\r\ninfestations. Either bordeaux mixture or lime and sulphur may be used as\r\na preventive.\r\n\r\nOld cherry trees are often attacked by a fleshy fungus or\r\n\"toadstool\"[64] (_Polyporus sulphureus_ (Bulliard) Fries). This fungus\r\nis said to be world-wide in its distribution and to occur upon a large\r\nvariety of trees. It is very striking in appearance, the clusters\r\nappearing during late summer or early autumn in large, shelving\r\nbranches, the sporophores fleshy and of cheese-like consistency when\r\nyoung but becoming hard and woody with age. At first the \"toadstools\"\r\nare all yellow but later only the under surfaces are yellow while the\r\nupper surface is orange-red. The plants are more or less odoriferous,\r\nthe odor increasing with age. Happily, the fungus is not very virulent\r\nbut is often the cause of decay in the tree-trunk--the brown-rot of the\r\nwood of this and other orchard and forest plants. In localities where\r\nthe fungus thrives it may usually be controlled by covering all wounds\r\nwith tar or other antiseptic materials.\r\n\r\nAt least two other fleshy fungi have been found injuring cherries. These\r\nare _Clitocybe parasitica_ Wilcox[65] and _Armillaria mellea_ Vahl.,[66]\r\nthe latter the honey agaric, more or less abundant in both Europe and\r\nAmerica. Both are associated with and are probably a cause of the\r\nroot-rot of the cherry and other orchard fruits. Neither is a common\r\nenough pest in this country, however, to receive extensive description\r\nin texts on diseases of plants. Control measures are different in\r\nlocalities where fungi occur, consisting in the main of getting rid of\r\nstumps and roots in orchard lands and planting to field crops before\r\nusing for orchard purposes. Infected trees should be removed or isolated\r\nby trenching about them.\r\n\r\nAll stone-fruits suffer more or less from an excessive flow of gum. The\r\nname gummosis[67] is generally applied to these troubles. Gumming is\r\nmuch more prevalent in the far West than in the East but is to be found\r\nwherever stone-fruits are grown. This excessive gumming is a secondary\r\neffect of injuries caused by fungi, bacteria, insects, frost, sunscald,\r\nand mechanical agencies. There is a good deal of difference in the\r\nsusceptibilities of varieties and species to this trouble, the Sweet\r\nCherry suffering much more than the Sour sorts and varieties of other\r\nspecies having hard wood suffering less than those having softer wood.\r\nThere is less gummosis, too, on trees in soils favoring the maturity of\r\nwood; under conditions where sun and frost are not injurious; and,\r\nobviously, in orchards where by good care the primary causes of the\r\ndiseases are kept out.\r\n\r\nA number of diseases of the trunk arise from mechanical injuries from\r\nwind, sun, frost and hail. Few, indeed, are the fruit-growers whose\r\ntrees are not occasionally damaged in one way or another in the\r\nvicissitudes of a trying climate. Very often these mechanical injuries\r\nare followed by fungal parasites or insects so as to make it difficult\r\nto distinguish the primary from the secondary trouble. There is a wide\r\ndifference in the susceptibility of _Prunus avium_ and _Prunus cerasus_\r\nto such injuries, the Sweet Cherry, with its softer wood, being much\r\nmore easily injured by any and all stresses of weather than the Sour\r\nCherry. In the main the elements cannot be combated but low heading of\r\nthe trees is a preventive from sunscald, at least, and sometimes may\r\nhave a favorable effect in preventing wind and frost injuries.\r\n\r\n    [55] Smith, E.

Entomologists list about 40 species of insects\r\nattacking cherries and about as many more occasionally attack the\r\nvarieties of one or the other of the two cultivated species. The\r\nmajority of these pests came with the tree from its habitat over the sea\r\nbut several have come from the wild cherries of this continent.\r\n\r\nOf the pests peculiar to the cherry alone, possibly the cherry fruit\r\nmaggot[68] (_Rhagoletis cingulata_ Loew) is, the country over, as\r\ntroublesome as any. The adult insect is a small fly with barred wings\r\nwhich lays eggs under the skin of the cherry in mid-summer. From these\r\neggs small, whitish maggots about one-third of an inch long hatch and\r\neat out a cavity in the ripening fruit. These maggots when full grown\r\npupate in the ground and remain there until the following season. The\r\nonly effective preventive or remedial measure to take against the pest\r\nin large orchards is to spray with a sweetened arsenical, but in small\r\nplantations chickens are fairly effective in scratching up and eating\r\nthe pupating maggots.\r\n\r\nThe cherry fruit maggot is probably responsible for most of the \"wormy\"\r\ncherries in New York but the plum curculio is also a cause of \"wormy\"\r\nfruits and in some seasons is a most formidable pest. This curculio[69]\r\n(_Conotrachelus nenuphar_ Herbst) is a rough, grayish snout-beetle\r\nsomewhat less than a quarter of an inch in length, so familiar an insect\r\nas scarcely to need further description. The female beetle pierces the\r\nskin of the young cherries and places an egg in the puncture. About this\r\ncavity she gouges out a crescent-shaped trench, this cut or sting being\r\na most discouraging sign to the cherry-grower, for he well knows that\r\nfrom the eggs come, within a week or two, white and footless grubs which\r\nburrow to the stone and make \"wormy fruit.\" Some of the infested\r\ncherries drop but many remain eventually to distract the housewife and\r\nthose who eat cherries out of hand. Jarring the beetles from the trees,\r\na method employed by plum-growers, is quite too expensive and\r\nineffective for the cherry-grower and poisoning with an arsenate is the\r\nonly practical means of combating the pest. Rubbish and vegetation offer\r\nhiding places for the insects and, therefore, cultivated orchards are\r\nfreer from curculio than those laid down to grass. There are no\r\ncurculio-proof cherries but, as with plums, the thin-skinned varieties\r\nare damaged most by the insect.\r\n\r\nThe grub of the plum curculio is easily distinguished from the cherry\r\nfruit maggot. This \"worm\" is the larva of a beetle, a true grub,\r\nfootless and with a brownish, horny head while the cherry fruit maggot,\r\nthe larva of a two-winged insect, is a true maggot like that which comes\r\nfrom the common house-fly and hardly to be distinguished from the apple\r\nmaggot. It is important to be able to distinguish in wormy cherries the\r\ngrub of the curculio from the cherry fruit maggot in order to know and\r\nunderstand the nature of the two enemies in combating them.\r\n\r\nAnother pest of this fruit is the cherry leaf-beetle (_Galerucella\r\ncavicollis_ Le Conte) the larvae of which sometimes do much damage to\r\ncherry foliage. The adult insect is an oval, reddish beetle about\r\none-fourth of an inch long with black legs and antennae. Both the adult\r\nand the larvae feed on the leaves and do much damage if abundant.\r\nUsually there are two broods, the insect pupating in the ground.\r\nFortunately the pest is easily controlled with the arsenical sprays.\r\n\r\nThe cherry scale (_Aspidiotus forbesi_ Johnson) is commonly found on\r\nthis fruit and occasionally on others as well. To the unaided eye it is\r\nvery similar to the well-known San José scale, differing chiefly in\r\nbeing lighter in color. The remedy is the same as for the San José\r\nscale, which we next discuss.\r\n\r\nThe dreaded San José scale[70] (_Aspidiotus perniciosus_ Comstock) is\r\nrather less harmful to cherries than to other tree-fruits and yet is\r\nsometimes a serious pest on Sweet Cherries. Sour Cherries are almost\r\nimmune. The insect is now so well known in all fruit-growing regions\r\nthat it needs no description. It is usually first recognized by its\r\nwork, evidence of its presence being dead or dying twigs--oftentimes the\r\nwhole tree is moribund. Examination shows the twigs or trees to be\r\ncovered with myriads of minute scales, the size of a small pin-head,\r\nwhich give the infested bark a scurfy, ashy look. If the bark be cut or\r\nscraped a reddish discoloration is found. Leaves and fruit as well as\r\nbark are infested, the insidious pest, however, usually first gaining a\r\nfoothold on the trunks or a large branch. Cherry-growers, in common with\r\nall fruit-growers, find the lime and sulphur solution the most effective\r\nspray in combating this insect.\r\n\r\nSeveral other scale insects feed on the cherries and, now and then,\r\nbecome pestiferous; among these the following may be named: The European\r\nfruit lecanium[71] (_Lecanium corni_ Bouché) occasionally does a great\r\ndeal of damage in New York and now and then destroys the whole crop in\r\nan orchard. The winter treatment for San José scale is used to control\r\nthis pest, but usually such treatment is supplemented by a summer spray\r\nabout July first with such contact sprays as whale oil soap and kerosene\r\nemulsion. The fruit pulvinaria (_Pulvinaria amygdali_ Cockerell), the\r\nmealy bug (_Pseudococcus longispinus_ Targioni), the scurfy scale\r\n(_Chionaspis furfura_ Fitch), the West Indian peach scale (_Aulacaspis\r\npentagona_ Targioni), the Putnam scale (_Aspidiotus ancylus_ Putnam),\r\nthe walnut scale (_Aspidiotus juglans-regiæ_ Comstock), Howard's scale\r\n(_Aspidiotus howardii_ Cockerell), the European fruit scale (_Aspidiotus\r\nostreæformis_ Curtis), the red scale of California (_Chrysomphalus\r\naurantii_ Maskell), the oyster-shell scale (_Lepidosaphes ulmi_\r\nLinnaeus), and the soft scale (_Coccus hesperidum_ Linnaeus), are all\r\nmore or less common.\r\n\r\nSeveral borers occasionally infest cherry trees of which the peach\r\nborer[72] (_Sanninoidea exitiosa_ Say.) is the most troublesome. Larvae\r\nof the peach borer are frequently found in both Sweet and Sour Cherries,\r\nmore particularly in Sweet Cherries, in eastern orchards. Fortunately\r\nthis pest is not as rife with the cherry as with peaches and plums. Its\r\nwork may be prevented by thorough cultivation, by mounding the trees\r\nand, according to some, by the use of a covering of tar or of obnoxious\r\nor poisonous washes. Usually preventive measures are not effective,\r\nhowever, and the borer must be destroyed--best done by digging it out\r\nwith a knife and wire. Since the pest is easily discovered through the\r\nexudation of gum mixed with sawdust or excreta, close to the surface or\r\njust beneath the ground, its presence can be detected in time to prevent\r\nits doing much damage. The lesser peach borer[73] (_Sesia pictipes_\r\nGrote & Robinson) often attacks old or weakened cherry trees, working in\r\nthe growing tissues of the trunk anywhere from the ground to the main\r\nbranches. The worm is much like the common peach borer, known by all,\r\nbut is smaller, rarely reaching the length of four-fifths of an inch\r\nwhen full grown. The flat-headed apple tree borer[74] (_Chrysobothris\r\nfemorata_ Fabricius) is a common pest in wild cherries and sometimes\r\nseriously attacks the cultivated species. It is treated as is the peach\r\nborer.\r\n\r\nThe shot-hole borer[75] (_Eccoptogaster rugulosus_ Ratzeburg), though\r\nseldom injuring healthy trees, is very often a serious menace in old or\r\ndecrepit cherry trees. It may be looked upon, however, as an effect\r\nrather than a cause. The peach bark-beetle[76] (_Phlæotribus liminaris_\r\nHarris) is very similar in its work to the shot-hole borer and like it\r\nattacks only diseased and decrepit trees.\r\n\r\nAll cherry-growers are familiar with the small, dark green, slimy slugs\r\nwhich feed on the surface of the leaves of the cherry, possibly more\r\ncommon on the foliage of pears, eating out the soft tissues and leaving\r\nbut the skeleton of the leaf. If the slugs are numerous the tree may be\r\ndefoliated or if the leaves remain the foliage looks as if scorched. The\r\nadult of this slug is a sawfly (_Caliroa_ (_Eriocampoides_) _cerasi_\r\nLinnaeus) which lays its eggs within the tissue of the leaves. Despite\r\nthe fact that it is easily destroyed by any of the arsenical sprays or\r\nby dusting with lime this slug everywhere does much damage to cherries.\r\n\r\nWild cherries suffer severely from the tent caterpillar[77] (_Malacosoma\r\namericana_ Fabricius) and occasionally cultivated trees are attacked.\r\nThe arsenical sprays are fatal to the pest. The spring canker-worm[78]\r\n(_Paleacrita vernata_ Peck) and the fall canker-worm[79] (_Alsophila\r\npometaria_ Harris), the white-marked tussock moth (_Hemerocampa\r\nleucostigma_ Smith and Abbot), the rusty tussock moth (_Hemerocampa\r\nantiqua_ Linnaeus), and the definite-marked tussock moth (_Hemerocampa\r\ndefinita_ Packard) are all occasional cherry pests and all succumb to\r\npoisonous sprays. The two now notorious European pests recently\r\nintroduced into America, gypsy moth (_Porthetria dispar_ Linnaeus) and\r\nthe browntail moth (_Euproctis chrysorrhæa_ Linnaeus), attack cherry\r\ntrees in common with other deciduous trees and may often do considerable\r\ndamage. Sometimes, but not often, the buds of the cherry are attacked by\r\nthe bud-moth (_Spilonota_ (_Tmetocera_) _ocellana_ Schiffermüller), the\r\ncaterpillars of which bind the young leaves together as they expand so\r\nthat small, dead, brown clusters of foliage are to be seen here and\r\nthere where the pests are at work. Spraying with arsenicals is effective\r\nif done just as the buds begin to open.\r\n\r\nIn sandy soils the cherry is sometimes attacked by hordes of the common\r\nrose-chafer (_Macrodactylus subspinosus_ Fabricius), leaves, flowers and\r\neven the fruit suffering from the pest. It is a difficult insect to\r\ncontrol but a spray of arsenate of lead with molasses is fairly\r\neffective. It is important to know that the insect does not often breed\r\nin ground kept in clean cultivation.\r\n\r\n    [68] Slingerland, M. V. _Bul. Cor. Ag. Ex. Sta._ =172=: 1899.\r\n\r\n    [69] Riley, C.

We do not know of its having been\r\ntried elsewhere in the East than on our grounds and here we find it, in\r\ncompetition with practically all of the varieties of its class, one of\r\nthe best of the Dukes. At this Station it does so well that we described\r\nit, in the reference given, as one of the noteworthy fruits in our\r\ncollection. The trees are large, vigorous, hardy, fruitful and very free\r\nfrom fungus diseases. The cherries are large, dark red, of most\r\nexcellent quality, combining the flavor of the Dukes with a firmer and\r\nyet tenderer flesh than the Montmorency. The high quality, handsome\r\nappearance and good shipping qualities of the fruit, combined with the\r\nsplendid characters of the tree, ought to make Abbesse d'Oignies a very\r\ngood commercial variety.\r\n\r\nThis cherry probably originated in Belgium about the middle of the\r\nNineteenth Century. At least it was first listed in Belgian nursery\r\ncatalogs in 1854. It is now a greater or less favorite wherever cherries\r\nare grown in the Old World, Professor Budd having found it, as we have\r\nsaid, in 1883, in Russia and immediately transported it to America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABBESSE d'OIGNIES]\r\n\r\n    Tree characteristically large and vigorous, upright-spreading,\r\n    round-topped but with drooping branchlets, hardy, productive;\r\n    trunk stocky, with shaggy bark; branches thick, smooth, ash-gray\r\n    over reddish-brown, with many lenticels; branchlets short, with\r\n    short internodes, brownish, roughened by transverse wrinkles and\r\n    by numerous conspicuous, small, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves two and one-half inches wide, five and one-half inches\r\n    long, folded upward, obovate, thick; upper surface glossy, dark\r\n    green; lower surface light green, slightly pubescent, distinctly\r\n    ribbed by the larger veins; apex taper-pointed, base acute; margin\r\n    with small, black glands, coarsely and doubly serrate; petiole\r\n    one and one-quarter inches long, thick, lightly tinged with red,\r\n    grooved, with one or two small, globose, reddish-orange glands.\r\n\r\n    Buds rather long, pointed, free, arranged often in elongated\r\n    clusters at the ends of long spurs; leaf-scars very prominent;\r\n    season of bloom medium, averaging five days in length; flowers\r\n    white, one and three-sixteenths inches across; borne in dense\r\n    clusters at the ends of long spurs or spur-like branches, well\r\n    distributed, varying from one to three; pedicels one-half inch\r\n    long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube reddish, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes tinged red, long, narrow, somewhat\r\n    acuminate, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish-oval, entire, nearly sessile, with a broad, shallow notch\r\n    at the apex; filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late; three-fourths inch long, seven-eighths inch thick,\r\n    roundish-oblate, slightly compressed; cavity of medium depth,\r\n    wide, regular; suture a line; apex roundish, slightly depressed;\r\n    color dark red; dots numerous, small, light russet, conspicuous;\r\n    stem slender, one and one-half inches long, adhering to the fruit;\r\n    skin tough; flesh yellowish-white, with colorless juice, slightly\r\n    stringy, tender and soft, sprightly subacid; of very good quality;\r\n    stone free, about three-eighths inch in diameter, roundish,\r\n    turgid, slightly pointed, with smooth surfaces; ridged along the\r\n    ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCH DUKE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

The concensus of opinion of those who\r\nhave known the true fruit of this name is that either May Duke or Late\r\nDuke is better. We give it prominence only because of its worthy past\r\nand that it may be better distinguished from May Duke with which it is\r\noften confused. As compared with the last-named variety it is two weeks\r\nlater; the tree is more vigorous but not as productive; and the\r\nbranches are larger, more divergent and more pendulous. The cherries\r\nare not as well flavored but are larger and have a shorter stalk.\r\n\r\nThis old English variety was first mentioned by Parkinson in _Paradisus\r\nTerrestris_, 1629. For many years previous to the middle of the last\r\ncentury the true Arch Duke cherry was very scarce and was often confused\r\nwith other varieties, some writers asserting that it was the May Duke;\r\nothers, the Late Duke. In 1847, however, the true Arch Duke cherry was\r\ndiscovered in the nurseries of Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England,\r\nhaving been grown there, according to Mr. Rivers, by his ancestors for\r\nnearly a century. It was then found that the fruit was quite unlike that\r\nof either May Duke or Late Duke, though the habit of the tree was\r\nsimilar. It is not known when Arch Duke was introduced into America but\r\nthe American Pomological Society placed it upon its fruit list in 1871.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCH DUKE]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, vigorous, somewhat upright, hardy,\r\n    productive; trunk stocky, smooth; branches slender, long, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown, marked with considerable scarf-skin, with numerous,\r\n    rather large lenticels; branchlets of medium length, curved, with\r\n    short internodes, brown mottled with ash-gray, smooth, glabrous,\r\n    with few small, slightly raised, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, about two inches wide, three inches long, folded\r\n    upward, short-oval to obovate, of medium thickness; upper surface\r\n    dark green; lower surface light green, very slightly pubescent;\r\n    apex acutely pointed; margin finely and doubly serrate, glandular;\r\n    petiole one inch long, tinged with dull red, slender, with one or\r\n    two, rarely three small, globose, brownish glands at the base of\r\n    the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, conical, plump, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds or in clusters of variable size; leaf-scars rather\r\n    prominent; season of bloom medium; flowers white, one and\r\n    one-sixteenth inches across; borne in clusters of twos and threes;\r\n    pedicels three-fourths inch long, rather slender, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube with a faint tinge of red, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes with a trace of red, of medium length and breadth,\r\n    acute, serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish, entire, nearly sessile, the apex entire or with a\r\n    shallow, wide notch; anthers yellowish; filaments three-sixteenths\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; one and one-eighth inches in\r\n    diameter, obtuse-cordate, slightly compressed, flattened at the\r\n    extremities; cavity of medium depth, narrow, somewhat obtuse;\r\n    suture distinct; apex flattened or depressed; color light red\r\n    becoming dark red or almost black at full maturity; dots numerous,\r\n    of medium size, russet, rather inconspicuous; stem slender, one\r\n    and one-half inches long, rather stout at its point of insertion\r\n    in the fruit, adherent to the fruit; skin moderately thick; flesh\r\n    light to dark red, firm, crisp, slightly astringent at first,\r\n    becoming a very pleasant subacid at full maturity, juicy, good\r\n    to very good in quality; stone semi-clinging, seven-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, three-eighths inch wide, oval, compressed, with smooth\r\n    surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALDWIN\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Kan.

The Early Richmond bud was in some manner broken off and the\r\nsprout, springing from the stock, was allowed to grow and first fruited\r\nin 1891. On the grounds of this Station Baldwin trees which came fairly\r\ndirect from the originator turned out to be Olivet. The published\r\ndescriptions that can be found are so scant and fragmentary that we\r\ncannot make out whether the variety is really distinct or, as in the\r\ncase of our trees, is Olivet renamed. The variety has been rather widely\r\ndisseminated in the Middle West but has not shown much merit either for\r\nhome or for commercial orchards in the rather lengthy probationary\r\nperiod it has had in the East. The American Pomological Society added\r\nBaldwin to its fruit list in 1909.

If the variety could be obtained it\r\nmight be worth growing for breeding work because of its earliness and\r\ngreat productiveness. At one time this variety was rather largely grown\r\nin central and western New York and specimens of it must yet remain in\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\nFrom the latter part of the Eighteenth Century, when we first find an\r\naccount of this variety in Kraft's _Pomona Austriaca_, to the last of\r\nthe Nineteenth, writers have described Baumann May under many different\r\nnames. From all accounts it originated toward the latter part of the\r\nEighteenth Century, in Germany. From Germany it was introduced into\r\nAlsace where F. J. Baumann, a nurseryman at Bollweiler, grew it in his\r\nnursery under the name Bigarreau Baumann and disseminated it throughout\r\nthe French provinces. The cherry was received in America, with several\r\nothers, by Colonel M. P. Wilder of Boston, Massachusetts, from Messrs.\r\nBaumann, about the year 1838. The American Pomological Society listed\r\nthe variety, in 1862, in its fruit catalog as Bauman's May but dropped\r\nit again in 1871. The following description is a compilation:\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, somewhat spreading, regular in form, compact, very\r\n    productive; branches stocky, nearly horizontal but often curved\r\n    downward; branchlets with short internodes, reddish-brown nearly\r\n    covered with silver-gray scarf-skin; leaves medium to large, dark\r\n    green, ovate-oblong, coarsely and deeply serrate; petiole rather\r\n    short, with two large, reniform glands near the base of the leaf;\r\n    buds large, ovate; flowers of medium size, opening very early.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very early; medium to rather small, ovate-cordate,\r\n    angular, irregular in outline; color dark red becoming nearly\r\n    black when fully ripe; stem one and three-quarters inches long,\r\n    rather thick; flesh purplish-red, with abundant juice, soft and\r\n    tender, sweet, well flavored; of good quality; stone medium in\r\n    size, roundish-ovate.\r\n\r\n\r\nBESSARABIAN\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

It is very\r\nhardy and is said to thrive even under neglect--standing as much abuse\r\nas a forest tree. As compared with standard commercial cherries of the\r\nEast the fruit is distinctly inferior in size and quality, being hardly\r\nfit to eat out of hand, and is sour and astringent even when cooked. The\r\ntrees, though hardy and healthy, are dwarfish and not productive because\r\nof the smallness of the cherries. It is an early cherry but the fruit\r\nhangs long. The variety is said to root well from cuttings, which, if\r\ntrue, might make it worth while trying as a stock. Bessarabian is a\r\nvariant of English Morello, the fruit of which sort greatly excels it\r\nwherever the trees can be equally well grown.\r\n\r\nThis variety was brought to America from Russia about 1883, by Professor\r\nJ. L. Budd of Ames, Iowa, who believed it to belong to a race of\r\ncherries originally found in central Asia.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright, becoming somewhat spreading,\r\n    compact, healthy, unproductive, very hardy; branches somewhat\r\n    drooping, long, slender; leaves abundant, medium to small, oval,\r\n    coarsely serrate, dark green, broad, flat; glands few, usually on\r\n    the stalk at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures medium early, remaining on the tree a long time\r\n    in good condition; medium in size, roundish-oblate to cordate,\r\n    irregular, bright red becoming dark red; stem long, varying\r\n    from one and three-fourths to two inches in length, slender,\r\n    curved; skin tender; flesh light to dark red, with abundant\r\n    colored juice, variable in firmness, sprightly subacid becoming\r\n    milder when fully ripe; fair in quality; stone variable in size,\r\n    roundish-oval, semi-clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGARREAU PÉLISSIER\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Soc.

It was introduced a few years later by M. Auguste\r\nPélissier, a nurseryman at Château-Renard, Bouches-du-Rhône, France.\r\nAlthough not yet well established even in France, this cherry is\r\nconsidered promising for market, because of its firm flesh, handsome\r\nappearance, high quality and good tree-characters. It is included among\r\nthe major varieties in _The Cherries of New York_ that the attention of\r\nAmerican cherry-growers may be called to it. As yet it seems not to have\r\nbeen tried in this country. The following description is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree upright, vigorous, very productive; branches rather long,\r\n    large, bearing large, oval leaves; flowers large, semi-open;\r\n    blooming season early.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures from early June to the last of June; large or very\r\n    large, obtuse-cordate, slightly depressed at the apex, with a\r\n    shallow yet distinct suture; stem short, thick; skin rather thick,\r\n    firm, yellowish almost entirely overspread with vivid red which\r\n    becomes darker at maturity but often showing streaks of clear red;\r\n    flesh fine-grained, firm, juicy, red with streaks of white, sweet,\r\n    aromatic; quality good to very good; stone of medium size, oval,\r\n    with a pronounced suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nBING\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

But few Sweet Cherries equal it in size and\r\nattractiveness and none surpass it in quality, so that it may be said to\r\nbe as good as any of the dessert cherries. It is, too, a very good\r\nshipping fruit, ranking with the best of the Bigarreaus, to which group\r\nit belongs, as a cherry for distant markets. Another quality commending\r\nthe variety is that it hangs well on the trees and the crop ripens at\r\none time so that the harvest consists of but one picking. While many\r\ncherry-growers speak well of the trees, unfortunately we cannot do so\r\nfrom their behavior on the grounds of this Station. They have not been\r\nas vigorous, as healthy or as productive as cherry trees should be in a\r\ncommercial variety of first rank. The cause, however, may be in the\r\nlocation rather than in the variety, for in an orchard but a few miles\r\ndistant Bing does much better than on these grounds. The variety, though\r\ncomparatively new, is no longer on probation. It has a niche in the\r\ncherry flora of the country, deserving a place in the collection of\r\nevery amateur by virtue of its splendid fruit. When it is happy in soil\r\nand climate, Bing is bound to be one of the leading commercial cherries.\r\n\r\nSeth Lewelling of Milwaukee, Oregon, the originator of several of our\r\nfinest cherries, grew Bing from the seed of Republican in 1875. The\r\nvariety was named after a Chinese workman. In 1899 the American\r\nPomological Society placed the variety on its fruit list.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, erect becoming upright-spreading, rather\r\n    open, productive; trunk and branches thick, smooth; branches\r\n    brownish with numerous, small lenticels; branchlets thick, long,\r\n    with long internodes, greenish-brown, smooth, pubescent, with\r\n    small, raised, conspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves abundant, large, folded upward, ovate to obovate of medium\r\n    thickness; upper surface dark green, smooth; lower surface light\r\n    green, pubescent; apex abruptly pointed, or acute, base abrupt;\r\n    margin slightly serrate, glandular; petiole long, pubescent,\r\n    thickish, tinged red, with from one to three large, reniform,\r\n    reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season or later; very large, one inch in\r\n    diameter, broadly cordate, somewhat compressed, slightly angular;\r\n    cavity deep, of medium width, abrupt, regular; suture a dark\r\n    line; apex roundish or slightly depressed; color very dark red,\r\n    almost black; dots small, russet, inconspicuous; stem variable\r\n    in thickness, one and one-fourth inches long; skin of medium\r\n    thickness, tough, adherent to the pulp; flesh purplish-red with\r\n    dark purple juice, rather coarse, firm, very meaty, brittle,\r\n    sweet; of very good quality; stone semi-free, large, ovate to\r\n    oval, blunt, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK GUIGNE\r\n\r\n    _Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Pom.

It\r\nundoubtedly originated in France and in that part of the country later\r\nconquered by the Germans, though Mas, in his _Pomologie Générale_,\r\nmentioned it as probably of German origin. In the time of Louis XIII\r\nthis variety was known as the Guigne Noire Commune and was cultivated\r\nquite extensively in France and northern Italy. It was esteemed both for\r\nits earliness and its fine quality and was known as Guigne Guindoulle by\r\nthe peasants of central France and by the Tuscans in Italy as Corbini\r\nbecause of the color of its skin. Black Guigne, Black Heart, and Early\r\nPurple, which, while similar in many characters, are entirely distinct,\r\nhave been badly confused by both French and German writers and it is\r\nonly with the greatest difficulty that the three can be separated. While\r\nthis cherry was formerly considered of worth in Continental Europe, it\r\nis scarcely recognized there now and was probably never brought to\r\nAmerica. The following description is compiled from European\r\nfruit-books:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BING]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, round-topped, spreading, irregular in outline,\r\n    productive; branches long, large, straight, brownish, mottled with\r\n    gray scarf-skin; internodes long and unequal; leaves large, oval\r\n    or oblong, acuminate; margin irregularly serrate; petiole long,\r\n    slender, with large glands; blooming season late; flowers small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the last of June to the middle of July, usually\r\n    attached in pairs but sometimes in threes; medium to large in\r\n    size, obtuse-cordate; color bright reddish-black changing to deep\r\n    purple; suture indistinct; stem slender, inserted in a deep,\r\n    broad cavity; skin thin, tender; flesh dark purple, with abundant\r\n    colored juice, half-tender, somewhat stringy, sweet yet sprightly,\r\n    pleasantly flavored; quality good; stone small, oval.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK HAWK\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Horticulturist_ =6=:360, 361 fig. 1851. =2.= _Am.

According to the older pomologists\r\nit was unsurpassed for eating out of hand but was only mediocre in all\r\nother characters of either fruit or tree. In particular it was surpassed\r\nin many ways by the better-known Eagle which fills about the same place\r\nin cherry culture. The variety was very popular in southern Ohio about\r\nCincinnati where many trees may still be found and where it is still\r\nmore or less planted. Possibly because of the excellent quality of the\r\nfruit, the amateur might well try a tree or two. The description is\r\ncompiled.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk originated with Professor J. P. Kirtland of Cleveland, Ohio,\r\nsometime previous to 1845. It is one of the best of the many seedlings\r\nfruited by him. The American Pomological Society in 1854 named this sort\r\nas one of the promising new fruits and it still remains on the\r\nfruit-list of this organization.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, round-topped, resembling Yellow\r\n    Spanish in habit, productive, healthy; branches stout, smooth,\r\n    dark reddish-brown, straight; branchlets slender, with short\r\n    internodes.\r\n\r\n    Leaves large, folded upward, obovate, rather thick; upper surface\r\n    dark green; lower surface pale green; apex abruptly pointed;\r\n    margin coarsely and deeply serrate; petiole short, stout, bright\r\n    red, with two or more orange-red, reniform glands.\r\n\r\n    Buds of medium size, rather short, free; flowers small or medium\r\n    in size; pedicels long, very slender; calyx-lobes straight, finely\r\n    serrate, obtuse; petals roundish, broadly and deeply notched at\r\n    the tip.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures about the middle of June, a few days later than\r\n    Black Tartarian; medium to large, obtuse-cordate, surface uneven,\r\n    sides compressed; cavity deep, broad, abrupt, nearly regular;\r\n    color glossy, dark purplish-black changing to almost black\r\n    at complete maturity; stem usually thick but often variable,\r\n    of medium length; skin thick, adhering to the pulp; flesh\r\n    purplish-black, tender, with abundant colored juice, aromatic,\r\n    well flavored, sweet; of very good quality; stone of medium size,\r\n    with uneven surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK HEART\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Rea _Flora_ 205. 1676. =2.= Prince _Pom.

Prince, in 1832, said that it was\r\nmore widely cultivated in the United States than any other variety and\r\nDowning, in 1845, said Black Heart was then better known than any other\r\ncherry in the country. While neither of these two statements would hold\r\nfor Black Heart now, it having long since passed its heyday of\r\npopularity, it is still, because of the fruitfulness of the tree and the\r\nhigh quality and beauty of the fruit, a variety of much merit. Black\r\nHeart fails in the commercial fruit growing of nowadays, as compared\r\nwith the cherry culture of the fruit connoisseurs of a generation ago,\r\nbecause it does not meet market demands, failing to do so through two\r\ndefects: it does not ship well and when brown-rot is rife it quickly\r\nsuccumbs to this fungus. It is, too, now difficult to obtain the variety\r\ntrue to name, the trees at this Station, as an example, in several\r\nattempts, turning out untrue, which forces the use of a compiled\r\ndescription in this text.\r\n\r\nThis cherry was mentioned by John Rea in 1676 but there can be no doubt\r\nbut that it originated many years previous to this date. Probably it is\r\nthe cherry mentioned by Robert Dodonée, a naturalist of Malines,\r\nBelgium, in 1552. When or by whom it was introduced to America is not\r\nknown but it was being grown here very early in the Nineteenth Century\r\nand ever since has been considered a valuable variety for general\r\nplanting. Nearly every nurseryman throughout the United States lists\r\nBlack Heart, a fact attesting its popularity. The American Pomological\r\nSociety placed Black Heart on its catalog of fruits in 1862, a place\r\nwhich it has since retained.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, very vigorous, tall, wide-spreading, productive;\r\n    branches stout, brownish, mingled with yellow, mottled with gray\r\n    scarf-skin; lenticels numerous, small.\r\n\r\n    Leaves very large, oblong, waved, acuminate, nearly flat; upper\r\n    surface dark green; margin deeply and coarsely serrate; petiole of\r\n    medium length, lightly tinged with red, with greenish glands.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, oval, pointed; season of bloom early or very early;\r\n    flowers medium in size; petals roundish, imbricated.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early, season long; large, obtuse-cordate, somewhat\r\n    compressed; cavity broad; suture deep; surface somewhat irregular;\r\n    color dark purple becoming black; stem one and three-fourths\r\n    inches long, slender; skin slightly shrivelled; flesh dark\r\n    red, firm to very firm becoming tender at full maturity, with\r\n    abundant colored juice, sweet; good in quality; stone large,\r\n    roundish-ovate; dorsal suture deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK TARTARIAN\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Truchsess-Heim _Kirschensort._ 130-132. 1819. =2.= _Pom.\r\n    Mag._ =1=:44, Pl. 1828. =3.= _Lond.

Cat._ 26. 1909.\r\n\r\nBlack Tartarian is probably the favorite dooryard and roadside Sweet\r\nCherry in New York and ranks second or third among commercial cherries\r\nin the State, as it probably does for the whole region east of the\r\nMississippi. It is known by all who grow or eat cherries. The\r\npreeminently meritorious characters which give it so high a place in\r\ncherry culture are: first, and most important, the elasticity of its\r\nconstitution whereby it adapts itself to widely different soils and\r\nclimates; second, the fruitfulness, healthfulness and robustness of the\r\ntrees which also bear regularly, live to an old age and grow to a\r\nprodigious size, oftentimes attaining a diameter of two feet; third,\r\nthis variety is comparatively free from the worst of cherry diseases,\r\nbrown-rot; lastly, the cherries, though not as large as some similar\r\nsorts, are tempting to the eye through their rotund form and glossy\r\nblack color and are a delight to the palate, the handsome purplish-red\r\nflesh being firm and crisp, yet juicy, with a sweet, rich flavor which\r\nall agree gives the quality the rank of \"very good to best.\" It is a\r\nvirile variety and from it have come several promising seedlings and it\r\nis one of the parents of a number of cross-bred cherries. Black\r\nTartarian is earlier than most of the Sweet Cherries with which it must\r\ncompete--under most conditions a help in marketing. Unfortunately it is\r\na little too soft to handle well in harvesting and marketing or to hold\r\nits shape as a canned product. Its small size is also against it for the\r\ncanner's trade. The several defects noted prevent Black Tartarian from\r\ntaking first rank in commercial orchards but for the home plantation it\r\nis one of the best.\r\n\r\nBlack Tartarian came originally from Russia. It was introduced into\r\nEngland in 1794 from Circassia, by Hugh Ronalds of Brentford, Middlesex,\r\nas Ronald's Large Black Heart. Two years later, John Fraser introduced a\r\nvariety, a native of Crimea, which he purchased in St. Petersburg, as\r\nFraser's Black Tartarian. This turned out to be the same as the cherry\r\nfrom Circassia. Some go farther back and say that Black Tartarian was\r\ncarried to Russia from Spain, thence to England. It owes its\r\nintroduction into this country to William Prince of Flushing, Long\r\nIsland, probably in the early part of the Nineteenth Century. It was\r\nrecognized in 1848 and placed on the schedule of fruits at the National\r\nConvention of Fruit Growers which later became the present American\r\nPomological Society. The variety still retains a place among the\r\nrecommended cherries but under the name Tartarian. The variety quickly\r\nbecame popular in America, finding a place in every orchard and in the\r\nlists of all nurserymen. Some nurserymen claim to have superior strains\r\nof the old variety; as, Green's Tartarian and Black Tartarian Improved.\r\nComparisons show no differences. Black Russian, listed by some firms, is\r\nprobably Black Tartarian as it is used many times as a synonym by\r\nforeign writers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK TARTARIAN]\r\n\r\n    Tree characteristically large, vigorous, upright, vasiform,\r\n    productive; trunk of medium thickness, smooth; branches smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown, slightly overspread with ash-gray, with large\r\n    lenticels; branchlets rather long, brown almost entirely\r\n    overspread with ash-gray, smooth, glabrous, with inconspicuous,\r\n    slightly raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, five and one-half inches long, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, obovate to elliptical, thin; upper\r\n    surface dark green, rugose; lower surface light green, slightly\r\n    pubescent; apex acute, base abrupt; margin varies from serrate to\r\n    crenate; petiole two inches long, thick, tinged with red, with\r\n    a few hairs, with from one to three reniform, reddish glands of\r\n    medium size usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds pointed or obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds, or in small clusters on spurs of variable length; leaf-scars\r\n    very prominent; season of bloom medium; flowers white, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches across, borne in scattering well-distributed\r\n    clusters in twos and threes; pedicels one inch long, slender,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube faintly tinged with red,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes with a trace of red, long,\r\n    broad, obtuse, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish, entire, with short, blunt claws; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments nearly one-half inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; less than one inch in diameter, cordate,\r\n    compressed; cavity intermediate in depth and width, flaring;\r\n    suture indistinct; apex pointed and slightly depressed; color\r\n    purplish-black; dots numerous, small, russet, obscure; stem\r\n    slender, one and one-half inches long, adherent to the fruit; skin\r\n    thin, separating readily from the pulp; flesh purplish-red, with\r\n    dark colored juice, firm, meaty, crisp, pleasant flavored, mild,\r\n    sweet; of very good quality; stone free, ovate, slightly flattened\r\n    and oblique, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING HEART\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Rea _Flora_ 205. 1676. =2.= Forsyth _Treat.

It is only of historical interest now and this chiefly because\r\nit has been the parent of many sorts of present worth. According to the\r\nold writers it took highest rank in the cherry lists of a century and\r\nmore ago by virtue of its high quality and handsome appearance, the name\r\nbeing indicative of color and form. So far as can be made out at this\r\nlate date the variety has been grown but little or not at all in\r\nAmerica, the description here given coming from old pomologies.\r\n\r\nThis, like the preceding sort, is a cherry of several names, having been\r\nmentioned first by Parkinson in 1629 as the Gascoign Cherry. In England\r\nthree different names have been applied to this variety, Gascoigne, Red\r\nHeart and Bleeding Heart. At least there seems to be little doubt that\r\nthe Bleeding Heart and Red Heart listed by John Rea in 1676 were the\r\nGascoign of Parkinson and Gerarde.\r\n\r\n    Tree of largest size, very vigorous, not very productive; branches\r\n    numerous, large, long, diverging, brownish-red, mottled with gray\r\n    scarf-skin; leaves very large, oblong, acuminate; margin crenate;\r\n    petiole thick, long, reddish, with well-developed glands; blooming\r\n    season early.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the latter half of July; usually in pairs, large,\r\n    elongated heart-shaped, with pointed apex; color bright red\r\n    changing to dark red, somewhat mottled; stem two inches long,\r\n    slender; flesh reddish, rather tender although firm, with abundant\r\n    juice, highly flavored, sweetish; good in quality; stone large,\r\n    oblong.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOURGUEIL\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    _Cerise de Bourgueil._ =1.= Mortillet _Le Cerisier_ =2=:205. 1866.\r\n\r\n    _Montmorency de Bourgueil._ =2.= Mas _Le Verger_ =8=:123, 124,\r\n    fig. 60. 1866-73. =3.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =5:=364, 365 fig. 1877.\r\n\r\nBourgueil is a variant form of Montmorency hardly differing enough in\r\nfruit from Large Montmorency to be distinguished from it and yet since\r\nit seems to be more productive than the last-named sort it is possibly\r\nworth adding to the cherry flora of the country. The variety, it must be\r\nremembered, is still on probation, but if trees true to name can be\r\nobtained it is worth planting in small numbers where growers want a\r\ncherry of the Montmorency type.\r\n\r\nThis variety was found by a Doctor Bretonneau about 1844 in Bourgueil,\r\nIndre-et-Loire, France. It is known by the name of the finder as well as\r\nthat of the locality in which it originated and through having the same\r\nplace of origin is often confused with Cerise Rouge Pale. The United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture received this variety in 1905 from\r\nFerdinand Jamin, Bourg-la-Reine, Seine, France, and in turn forwarded it\r\nto this Station where it has been fruiting for the past few seasons.\r\nNurserymen do not as yet offer it for sale and it is doubtful if it is\r\nknown in more than a few places in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOURGUEIL]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright-spreading, vasiform, productive; branches\r\n    slender, smooth, reddish-brown partly covered with ash-gray, with\r\n    numerous lenticels; branchlets slender, long, brown, with some\r\n    ash-gray, smooth, with numerous inconspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, four inches long, two inches wide, folded upward,\r\n    obovate to ovate, thick; upper surface dark green, smooth; lower\r\n    surface light green, pubescent along the veins; apex and base\r\n    variable in shape; margin doubly crenate; petiole one inch long,\r\n    thick, with a dull tinge of red, pubescent, with none or with from\r\n    one to three globose, yellow or brownish glands on the base of the\r\n    blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, variable in shape, plump, free, arranged singly\r\n    as lateral buds and on short spurs in clusters variable in size;\r\n    leaf-scars prominent; season of bloom late; flowers white, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches across; borne in scattering, well-distributed\r\n    clusters, usually in threes; pedicels short, one-half inch\r\n    long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube faintly tinged with red,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes with a trace of red, broad,\r\n    serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals crinkled,\r\n    roundish, entire, sessile, with apex entire; filaments one-fourth\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; three-fourths inch long, one inch\r\n    wide, nearly oblate, somewhat compressed; cavity deep, wide,\r\n    medium flaring, regular; suture indistinct; apex roundish to\r\n    flattened; color bright red; dots small, russet, inconspicuous;\r\n    stem stout, one and one-eighth inches long, adherent to the fruit;\r\n    skin tender, free; flesh yellowish-white with colorless juice,\r\n    tender and melting, sprightly, sour; of good quality; stone free,\r\n    large, roundish-ovate, pointed, with smooth surfaces, tinged with\r\n    red, with a prominent ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELER BRAUNE\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    1.

The trees are uncertain in bearing; the cherries are\r\nsmall, sour, and astringent; and, worse than the faults named, the crop\r\nripens very unevenly. It is of the English Morello type but in New York,\r\nat least, is far inferior to this well-known sort. Brusseler Braune has\r\nbeen much advertised for cold climates but there are many better\r\ncherries that stand cold nearly or quite as well and are better in both\r\ntree and fruit characters and, in particular, that will not vex the\r\nsouls of growers by ripening so unevenly. The variety has two marked\r\npeculiarities: the leaves on the two-year-old wood are very small and\r\nthe fruit-stems bear a small leaflet at their base. These leaflets on\r\nthe fruit-stem would have to be removed in marketing the crop--another\r\nserious defect.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Brusseler Braune originated in Holland but there is nothing\r\ndefinite as to the time though Truchsess, a German, writes of having\r\nreceived it in 1785 as Brüsselsche Bruyn. The synonyms of this variety\r\nare more or less confused with those of English Morello. This cherry was\r\nbrought to America in 1883 by the late J. L. Budd with several other\r\nvarieties. In the collection of trees sent out from the original\r\nimportation, of which this was one, or from trees budded from them, were\r\nGriotte du Nord, Large Long Late, Shadow Amarelle, Lutovka, George\r\nGlass, Orel No. 27, or Gibb, and Bessarabian. Unfortunately the\r\nvarieties were badly mixed and much confusion has resulted. It is not\r\nimpossible that the first three are synonyms but the Lutovka, George\r\nGlass, Bessarabian and possibly the Gibb are distinct varieties. In\r\n1895, this Station recommended a new cherry for trial for home and\r\nmarket and distributed buds throughout the state under the name Lutovka.\r\nLater it was found that an error had been made regarding the trees sent\r\nus as Lutovka, they being the Brusseler Braune. The American Pomological\r\nSociety added Brusseler Braune to its fruit catalog list in 1899 but\r\ndropped it in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRUSSELER BRAUNE]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright-spreading but with drooping\r\n    branchlets, dense, round-topped, unproductive; trunk and branches\r\n    smooth, stout; branches brownish, overspread with ash-gray,\r\n    with numerous small lenticels; branchlets slender, with short\r\n    internodes, nearly covered with ash-gray, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    small, lightly raised, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves three and one-half inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, obovate, thick, grooved along the\r\n    midrib; upper surface very dark, dull green; lower surface light\r\n    green, pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base acute; margin finely\r\n    and doubly serrate; petiole one and one-eighth inches long, tinged\r\n    with dull, dark red, grooved along the upper surface, with from\r\n    one to four small, globose, yellowish-green glands.\r\n\r\n    Buds pointed, plump, free, arranged as lateral buds and in\r\n    clusters on scattering, short spurs; leaf-scars prominent; season\r\n    of bloom late; flowers one inch across, white; borne in scattering\r\n    clusters in threes and fours; pedicels one and one-eighth inches\r\n    long, slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube furrowed, tinted\r\n    with red, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes with a trace of red,\r\n    acuminate, serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed;\r\n    petals oval to obovate, entire, nearly sessile, with a shallow,\r\n    wide notch at the apex; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; nearly one inch in diameter, although\r\n    variable in size, roundish-cordate, slightly compressed; cavity\r\n    of medium depth, narrow, abrupt; suture very shallow, indistinct;\r\n    apex roundish, with a small depression at the center; color light\r\n    red changing to dark red as the season advances; dots numerous,\r\n    small, dark russet, inconspicuous; stem two and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, with small leaflets at the base, strongly adherent to the\r\n    fruit; skin thin, tender, separates readily from the pulp; flesh\r\n    dark red, with dark colored juice, tender and melting, somewhat\r\n    astringent, sour; of fair quality; stone nearly free when fully\r\n    mature, fifteen-thirty-seconds inch long, roundish-oval, rather\r\n    plump, blunt-pointed; surfaces smooth; ventral suture slightly\r\n    enlarged near the base.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUNTE AMARELLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    1.

It is not attractive enough in\r\nappearance, good enough in quality, or certain and fruitful enough in\r\nbearing to compete with other Amarelles, to which group this variety\r\nbelongs. Its saving grace is extreme hardiness of tree, though vigor and\r\nhealth help make it somewhat desirable in cold, prairie regions of the\r\nMid-West where cherry growing is more or less precarious. There has been\r\nmuch uncertainty as to the true variety and we have had to discard the\r\ntrees on the Station grounds and compile a description.\r\n\r\nThis variety probably originated in Germany in the latter part of the\r\nEighteenth Century. Truchsess, a German, in 1819, called the cherry\r\nBunte Amarelle because of its variegated color before full maturity. The\r\nvariety was introduced from Poland to America sometime previous to 1885\r\nand has usually gone under the name of Amarelle Bunte. From all accounts\r\nProfessor J. L. Budd of Ames, Iowa, the authority on these hardy\r\ncherries during his time, had two different cherries under the name\r\nAmarelle Bunte; for in his report at the Iowa Horticultural Society in\r\n1885, he mentioned a variety under that name as being a large, dark\r\npurple and nearly sweet sort which could not have been the true Bunte\r\nAmarelle of Truchsess. Budd and Hansen in 1903 described a variety\r\nwhich agrees very closely with the true variety of Truchsess which we\r\nherewith describe.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright, hardy; foliage large, coarse.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the second week in June; medium to large, roundish,\r\n    flattened at the base; cavity variable in depth; suture shallow,\r\n    indistinct; apex depressed; color yellow overspread with light\r\n    red; stem green, straight, rather slender, one and one-half to\r\n    two inches long; flesh slightly colored, juicy, firm but tender,\r\n    pleasantly subacid; very good in quality; stone variable in size,\r\n    broad.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA ADVANCE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    1.

It is usually\r\ndescribed as a cherry of \"large size\" but on the grounds of this Station\r\nthe cherries run small, as they are occasionally reported elsewhere to\r\ndo, suggesting that the variety requires good care and a choice cherry\r\nsoil for a finely finished product. On these grounds the variety seems\r\nto be preeminently free from fungus diseases but the robin and other\r\nbirds take greater toll from it than from almost any other cherry,\r\nbeginning their harvest long before the fruit is fit for human fare.\r\nCalifornia Advance might well be planted in a small way for a local\r\nmarket in New York, or a tree or two for home use, but it has no place\r\nin large numbers in this State.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Advance came from a seed of Early Purple sown by W. H.\r\nChapman of Napa, California, the seedling being saved because the\r\ncherries were larger and ripened earlier than those of its parent. It\r\nhas sometimes been confused with the Chapman cherry, of somewhat similar\r\ncharacteristics, which also originated in Napa, but the two are quite\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense, productive; trunk\r\n    and branches stout, smooth; branchlets of medium thickness,\r\n    brownish-bronze partly covered with ash-gray, glabrous; leaves\r\n    numerous, five and one-half inches long, two and one-half inches\r\n    wide, long-obovate to elliptical, thin, medium green, slightly\r\n    rugose; margin serrate, glandular; petiole nearly two inches long,\r\n    slender, tinged with red, pubescent along the upper side and with\r\n    a shallow groove, with from two to four large, reniform, reddish\r\n    glands, usually on the stalk; buds large, obtuse or pointed,\r\n    plump, arranged singly as lateral buds or in clusters of variable\r\n    size on numerous short spurs; leaf-scars prominent; season of\r\n    bloom early; flowers one and one-eighth inches across; pistil\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens very early, season averaging eleven days; about\r\n    three-fourths inch in diameter, roundish-cordate, compressed;\r\n    color purplish-black; stem of medium thickness, often one\r\n    and one-half inches long, adherent to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    tender, separates from the pulp; flesh reddish, with dark red\r\n    juice, meaty, tender, mild, sweet; of very good quality; stone\r\n    semi-clinging, three-eighths inch by eleven-thirty-seconds inch in\r\n    size, roundish-oval, compressed, oblique, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNATION\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Rea _Flora_ 205. 1676. =2.= Langley _Pomona_ 86, Pl. 16 fig.\r\n    3. 1729. =3.= Forsyth _Treat.

It is one of the\r\nAmarelles, similar to Montmorency except in color in which character it\r\nis more pleasing than the better-known sort. The stone separates from\r\nthe pulp very readily leaving the flesh unusually bright and clean.\r\nBecause of their sprightly refreshing flavor, the cherries are pleasing\r\nto the palate, as well as attractive to the eye. Unfortunately the trees\r\nare but moderately vigorous and fruitful and these qualities count so\r\nheavily against it as a commercial cherry that Carnation cannot be more\r\nthan a fruit for amateurs unless under exceptional conditions. For a\r\nhome plantation, however, it would be hard to name a better cherry of\r\nits kind.\r\n\r\nCarnation is another of the choicely good, old cherries, being first\r\nmentioned by John Rea in 1676 and later by Langley in 1729. Having been\r\ncultivated for so long and disseminated among so many growers who kept\r\nmeagre records in early days, this sort became badly confused with other\r\nvarieties, especially with the \"Cerisier à gros fruit rouge-pale,\"\r\nmentioned by Duhamel in 1768. How old the variety truly is or where it\r\noriginated cannot be said. Carnation seems to have been first mentioned\r\nin America by William Coxe in 1817 and a few years later it was growing\r\non the grounds of William Prince, Flushing, New York. Since that time it\r\nhas been quite widely disseminated throughout the United States but is\r\ngrown less extensively now than formerly. The American Pomological\r\nSociety, in 1862, placed Carnation on its list of recommended fruits\r\nwhere it still holds a place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARNATION]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, spreading, becoming drooping, not\r\n    very productive; trunk intermediate in thickness; branches\r\n    reddish-brown overspread with ash-gray, with numerous lenticels\r\n    variable in size; branchlets brown or ash-gray, smooth, with\r\n    numerous conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves very numerous, four inches long, two inches wide, folded\r\n    upward, oval to obovate, thin; upper surface dark green,\r\n    roughened; lower surface dull, light green, thinly pubescent; apex\r\n    acute; margin finely and doubly serrate, glandular; petiole two\r\n    inches long, slender, dull red on the upper surface, with one or\r\n    two large, reniform, reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds, or in small clusters on numerous, short spurs; season of\r\n    bloom late; flowers white, one and one-fourth inches across;\r\n    borne in scattered clusters in twos and threes; pedicels one inch\r\n    long, of medium thickness, glabrous, green; calyx-tube light\r\n    reddish-green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes tinged with\r\n    red, of medium length, broad, acute, glabrous within and without,\r\n    reflexed; petals roundish-oval, entire, with short, broad claws,\r\n    the apex notched; filaments in four series, the longest averaging\r\n    one-half inch in length; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season or later; three-fourths of an inch\r\n    long, one inch in thickness, roundish-oblate, compressed; cavity\r\n    deep, abrupt; suture indistinct; apex flattened or with a deep\r\n    depression; color medium to dark red; dots numerous, small,\r\n    russet, inconspicuous; stem one and one-half inches long, adherent\r\n    to the fruit; skin tender, separating readily from the pulp;\r\n    flesh yellowish-white, with abundant colorless juice, tender and\r\n    melting, sprightly; of very good quality; stone free, nearly\r\n    one-half inch in diameter, roundish, blunt, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTENNIAL\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Cat._ 24. 1899.\r\n\r\nIn California, Centennial is passing from the period of probation to one\r\nof general acceptance as a standard variety. Unfortunately it has not\r\nbeen well tested in the East but trees growing in a commercial orchard\r\nat Geneva show the variety to be a close competitor, in this instance at\r\nleast, with its parent, Napoleon, the mainstay of Sweet Cherry growers\r\nin New York. In some respects it quite surpasses Napoleon. It is larger,\r\nsweeter and better flavored and has a smaller pit. The trees fall short\r\nof those of its well-known parent, however, in being less fruitful. Even\r\nmore serious defects are, in the orchard under observation, that\r\nCentennial cracks and is less successful in resisting brown-rot than\r\nNapoleon though it surpasses many other well-known sorts in these\r\nrespects. The two varieties under comparison may be further\r\ndistinguished by the more oblate fruits of Centennial, by a more\r\nmottled color and by the pits which are longer and more pointed in the\r\nnewer variety. Centennial is recommended for home orchards and\r\nexperimentally for commercial plantations.\r\n\r\nCentennial is a seedling of Napoleon grown by Henry Chapman, Napa,\r\nCalifornia. It came in fruit in 1876 but was not introduced until 1885,\r\nLeonard Coates of Napa, California, being the introducer. Despite its\r\nmany merits, Centennial did not win a place on the fruit list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society until 1899.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, productive;\r\n    trunk thick, roughish; branches stout, smooth, brownish, with\r\n    many large lenticels; branchlets thick, with internodes of medium\r\n    length.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, large, flattened, long-oval to obovate, thick;\r\n    upper surface dark green, rugose; lower surface pale green, thinly\r\n    pubescent; apex taper-pointed; margin coarsely serrate, with small\r\n    and inconspicuous glands; petiole one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    pubescent, tinged with red, with from two to four large, reniform,\r\n    greenish-red, flattened glands, usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds or in small clusters on short spurs; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent; blooming season about the middle of May; flowers one\r\n    and one-fourth inches across, usually arranged in twos and threes;\r\n    pedicels variable in length averaging one and one-eighth inches,\r\n    slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube faintly tinged with red,\r\n    obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes long, acute, glabrous on both\r\n    surfaces, reflexed; petals oval, entire, tapering to short, narrow\r\n    claws, with a slightly crenate apex; anthers greenish; filaments\r\n    one-eighth inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil glabrous,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the last week in June, length of season rather\r\n    short; very large, short-cordate, compressed; cavity deep, wide;\r\n    suture distinct, broad, shallow; apex roundish or slightly\r\n    depressed; color amber-yellow, speckled and overlaid with crimson;\r\n    dots whitish, inconspicuous; stem thick, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches long, adherent to the pulp; skin thin, tender, cracks\r\n    badly, adherent to the pulp; flesh whitish, with colorless juice,\r\n    meaty, crackling, sprightly, sweet; of very good quality; stone\r\n    semi-clinging, three-eighths inch in length, eleven-thirty-seconds\r\n    inch in width, ovate, plump, oblique, with smooth surfaces; ridged\r\n    on the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOISY\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    _Cerisier à Fruit Ambré, à Fruit Blanc._ =1.= Duhamel _Trait.

In it are delicately combined the richness of the\r\nSweet Cherry and the sprightliness of the Sour Cherry. Unfortunately,\r\nwhile it bears early and regularly, the trees are seldom fruitful. As an\r\noffset to unfruitfulness, however, the trees are vigorous, hardy and\r\nhealthy. The cherries keep and stand the wear and tear of marketing as\r\nwell as those of any other Duke. Its qualities all commend it for the\r\nhome orchard and for a local market. In particular it may be recommended\r\nfor cold climates where a true Sweet Cherry is not quite hardy, this\r\nhybrid being nearly as hardy as the other parent, the Sour Cherry.\r\nUnfortunately suitable specimens of this beautiful cherry could not be\r\nobtained for a color-plate and the description has had to be compiled in\r\npart.\r\n\r\nDuhamel describes two amber-colored cherries, one of which is listed by\r\nLeroy as Belle de Choisy. The Cerise Blanche, or Cerise Ambrée (Grosse),\r\naccording to Leroy, was cultivated in Central France as early as 1628\r\nand in 1667 Merlet wrote of it as the most curious and rare of all\r\ncherries. Kenrick, _American Orchardist_, 1832, lists a variety, Ambrée,\r\nwhich according to Floy-Lindley's and Duhamel's descriptions must be\r\nChoisy. Some writers, however, say that Choisy was first grown by M.\r\nGondouin, a gardener for Louis XV, in 1760, at the village of Choisy\r\nnear Paris. The American Pomological Society, in its report for 1852,\r\nmentioned this variety as having promise and ten years later listed it\r\nin the Society's fruit catalog where it has since remained.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, somewhat open, hardy, but\r\n    moderately productive; branches thick, of a clear grayish color\r\n    with brownish-red tips; lenticels very numerous, large, roundish.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, very broad, obovate, rather abruptly pointed;\r\n    upper surface shining dark green, deeply and regularly serrate to\r\n    rather dentate.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, thick, conical, clear brown somewhat covered with\r\n    gray; season of bloom rather early; flowers white, large,\r\n    numerous, borne in large clusters; petioles short, scarcely an\r\n    inch in length; petals broadly round, edges dentate; calyx-lobes\r\n    short, large; pistil longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in some localities just before May Duke, in others\r\n    just after that variety, ordinarily ripe, however, at the end of\r\n    June; usually attached in pairs, large, roundish to somewhat oval,\r\n    flattened toward the base; cavity shallow, wide; suture shallow,\r\n    indistinct; apex depressed; color attractive bright red mottled\r\n    with yellow and amber; stem thick at the base, one and one-half\r\n    to two inches long, generally forking at about one-half inch\r\n    from the base; skin thin, somewhat firm, semi-transparent showing\r\n    the netted texture of the pulp beneath; flesh pale amber, with\r\n    abundant colorless juice, tender, melting, sweet, pleasant flavor;\r\n    very good in quality; stone medium to small, roundish, pointed at\r\n    the apex; dorsal suture indistinct; surfaces nearly smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVELAND\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    1. _Horticulturist_ =2=:60 fig. 1847-48. 2.

The\r\ncherries closely resemble Rockport in size, color, shape and flavor, are\r\nin no way better than that somewhat mediocre sort and are even more\r\nsubject to brown-rot. It ripens with Black Tartarian and can never\r\ncompete in orchard or market with that sort. Possibly Cleveland has too\r\nmuch merit to be wholly neglected yet it certainly is not worth planting\r\nin New York unless in a locality where it does exceptionally well and\r\nwhen an early cherry of its kind is wanted.\r\n\r\nCleveland is said by its introducer, Professor J. P. Kirtland, to be a\r\nseedling from Yellow Spanish. Its close similarity to Rockport suggests\r\nthat it may have come from a pit of that variety. It was brought out in\r\n1842 but was not adopted by the American Pomological Society for its\r\nfruit list until 1862. Despite rapidly passing popularity it is still on\r\nthis list.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, open, very\r\n    productive; trunk of medium diameter and smoothness; branches\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown partly overspread with ash-gray, with many\r\n    small lenticels; branchlets slender, brown partly overspread with\r\n    ash-gray, smooth, with numerous small, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, five inches long, two and one-half inches wide,\r\n    folded upward, obovate to long-elliptical, thin; upper surface\r\n    medium green, slightly rugose; lower surface light green, lightly\r\n    pubescent; apex acute, base abrupt; margin coarsely and doubly\r\n    serrate, glandular; petiole often two inches long, reddish, rather\r\n    slender, hairy, grooved, glandless or with from one to four\r\n    reniform, reddish glands, usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds or in clusters of variable size on rather short\r\n    spurs; leaf-scars prominent; flowers white, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches across; borne in scattered clusters, usually in twos;\r\n    pedicels three-fourths inch long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube\r\n    green, tinged with red, light green within, broadly campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes tinged with red, broad, acute, glabrous\r\n    within and without, reflexed; petals roundish, entire, with\r\n    short, broad claws, notched and crinkled at the apex; filaments in\r\n    four series, the longest averaging one-half inch in length; pistil\r\n    glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; about three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\n    cordate, compressed, cavity wide, flaring, irregular; suture\r\n    shallow, indistinct; apex somewhat obtusely-pointed; color light\r\n    red overspreading yellow; dots numerous, small, yellowish,\r\n    obscure; stem slender, one and one-half inches long, adherent to\r\n    the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating readily from the pulp;\r\n    flesh light yellow, with colorless juice, tender and melting,\r\n    sweet; of good quality; stone clinging, large, one-half inch long,\r\n    oval, flattened at the base, plump, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUSTER\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    1.

The pistils vary from one to a dozen,\r\nsetting from one to five perfect fruits in the cluster or from eight to\r\ntwelve as the trees become older. The variety is little known in America\r\nbut is well known in Europe, having first been described by Daléchamp in\r\n1586, according to Leroy. Its origin is uncertain. Parkinson speaks of\r\nit as Flanders Cluster, in 1629, and as it was cultivated in Germany\r\nbefore 1613 and nearly as soon in Switzerland it may be assumed that\r\neither South Germany or Flanders is its native home. It appears under\r\nseveral names in European fruit books, the terms trochet, bouquet,\r\nbuschel, and trauben all signifying that the fruits are borne in\r\nclusters and usually referring to this variety. The Cerisier à Trochet\r\nof Duhamel is probably a distinct variety. The fruit has little value\r\nand is cultivated chiefly as a curiosity. The following description is\r\ncompiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree small and bushy, moderately vigorous, dense, productive;\r\n    branches numerous, long, slender, somewhat curved, drooping and\r\n    often breaking under a load of fruit; internodes long; leaves\r\n    small, oblong, acuminate; margin doubly serrate; petiole thick,\r\n    short, rigid, with small, roundish, conspicuous glands; blooming\r\n    season late; flowers small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the last of June, attached in twos or threes, with\r\n    from two to eight fruits per cluster; variable in size, roundish,\r\n    flattened at the extremities; suture prominent; color clear red\r\n    becoming darker at maturity; skin tough, transparent; stem long,\r\n    inserted in a deep cavity; flesh nearly white, transparent, with\r\n    abundant juice which is usually uncolored but sometimes tinged\r\n    red, very tender, sour, yet agreeable; quality fair; stone small,\r\n    roundish, compressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    1. _Am.

This is the first of\r\nthe light-colored cherries to ripen and is a splendid fruit in quality\r\nand appearance. The color-plate shows this variety very well--possibly\r\ntoo well, since one of its defects is variability in color, the variant\r\nusually being very light colored and not as attractive as the type. A\r\nsecond defect is that the fruit runs rather small. The tree-characters\r\nare in the main very good. The variety can be distinguished, as a rule,\r\nby the large, spreading tree and to a lesser extent by its hardiness,\r\nvigor, healthfulness and fruitfulness. Coe is worthy of a place in every\r\nhome plantation, in orchards for local markets and in favored localities\r\nas an early cherry for the general market.\r\n\r\nCurtis Coe of Middletown, Connecticut, grew this variety early in the\r\nNineteenth Century from a pit of what he supposed to be Ox Heart. The\r\nAmerican Pomological Society included Coe in its list of recommended\r\nfruits in 1856.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open, very productive;\r\n    trunk stocky, shaggy; branches thick, smooth, dark reddish-brown\r\n    overlaid with ash-gray, with many raised lenticels; branchlets\r\n    stout, short, brown nearly covered with gray, smooth, glabrous,\r\n    with numerous small, conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, four and one-fourth inches long, two\r\n    and one-fourth inches wide, folded upward or flattened,\r\n    long-elliptical to obovate, thin; upper surface medium green;\r\n    lower surface light green, thinly pubescent; apex acute, base\r\n    abrupt; margin coarsely serrate, with small, black glands;\r\n    petiole one and three-fourths inches long, thick, tinged with\r\n    red, grooved, hairy, with from one to three large, reniform,\r\n    greenish-yellow or reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long, conical, plump, free, in clusters on spurs\r\n    variable in length; leaf-scars very prominent; season of bloom\r\n    intermediate; flowers one and one-fourth inches across, white;\r\n    borne in dense clusters, thickly distributed over the tree in twos\r\n    and threes; pedicels one inch long, slender, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube green, broadly campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    tinged with red, broad, obtuse, glabrous within and without,\r\n    reflexed; petals roundish, entire, with a shallow notch at the\r\n    apex; filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; nearly one inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-cordate, slightly compressed; cavity regular, abrupt;\r\n    suture indistinct; apex blunt-pointed or slightly depressed;\r\n    color pale amber faintly mottled with red; dots small, light\r\n    yellow, inconspicuous; stem slender, one and one-half inches long,\r\n    adherent to the fruit; skin thin, of medium toughness, separating\r\n    from the pulp; flesh pale yellow, with colorless juice, tender,\r\n    meaty, mild, sweet; good to very good in quality; stone semi-free\r\n    or free, one-half inch long, less than one-half inch wide,\r\n    roundish, somewhat flattened, blunt, with smooth surfaces; ridged\r\n    along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIKEMAN\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    1. _Del. Sta. Bul._ =35=:16, 17 fig. 1897.\r\n\r\nDikeman has some merit as a very late Sweet Cherry but here its\r\nusefulness ends. The cherries are too small and the pits too large for\r\nthis variety to have great worth. The tree is somewhat remarkable for\r\nits spreading habit and stout branches. Plant-breeders seeking for a\r\nvery late sort might well choose Dikeman as a parent.\r\n\r\nTwo very similar cherries, with a variation in the spelling, pass under\r\nthis name. Late in the Eighteenth Century there appeared a cherry on the\r\nDyckman farm near New York City. Some thought it to be identical with\r\nBlack Tartarian; others said it was distinct and called it Dyckman. It\r\nwas never more than of local note. Some few years ago the late S. D.\r\nWillard of Geneva introduced the Dikeman cherry from the farm of George\r\nB. Dikeman, Oceana County, Michigan. This variety often goes under the\r\nname Dykeman but from the information at hand we feel certain that\r\nDikeman is the correct spelling. On our grounds this variety and Black\r\nTartarian, although similar, are two distinct sorts, the Dikeman being\r\nlater, firmer and a clingstone.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, broadly-spreading, open-topped, productive;\r\n    trunk and branches thick, smooth; branches reddish-brown covered\r\n    with ash-gray, with numerous lenticels which are variable in size;\r\n    branchlets short, brown, partly covered with ash-gray, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with inconspicuous, slightly raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, four and one-half inches long, two and one-fourth\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, obovate to long-elliptical, thin;\r\n    upper surface medium green, slightly rugose; lower surface light\r\n    green, faintly pubescent; apex acute, base abrupt; margin coarsely\r\n    and doubly serrate; petiole about one and one-half inches long,\r\n    tinged with red, with a few hairs, with from one to four reniform,\r\n    reddish glands, usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds or in clusters variable in size on short spurs; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent; season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches across; borne in scattering clusters, in\r\n    ones, twos or threes; pedicels one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube tinged with red, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes with reddish tinge, broad, acute, glabrous\r\n    within and without, reflexed; petals roundish, entire, nearly\r\n    sessile, with a shallow notch at the apex; filaments one-half inch\r\n    long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; about three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\n    cordate; cavity wide, flaring; suture shallow, indistinct; apex\r\n    slightly pointed, with a small depression at the center; color\r\n    purplish-black; dots numerous, small, dark russet, inconspicuous;\r\n    stem slender, one and one-fourth inches long, adherent to the\r\n    fruit; skin thin, tender, adherent to the pulp; flesh dark red,\r\n    with dark colored juice, very meaty, crisp, mild, somewhat\r\n    aromatic, sweet; of good quality; stone clinging, longer than\r\n    wide, ovate, flattened, with smooth surfaces, somewhat marked with\r\n    a reddish tinge.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE GLASS\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    1.

Bul._ =73=:70. 1903.\r\n\r\nDouble Glass is a Duke, a hybrid more nearly resembling the Sweet Cherry\r\nthan the Sour Cherry. The trees grow remarkably well in nursery and\r\norchard and their behavior so pleased growers when the variety was\r\nbrought to notice that it became for a time quite the vogue. But the\r\ntrees turned out to be unproductive and the cherries so mediocre that\r\nthe variety rapidly passed through its heyday of popularity. The fruits\r\nare curiously marked, the suture being so deep as to make them appear\r\ndouble--hence the name. The variety has no value where sweet sorts are\r\nhardy but possibly might find a niche somewhere in regions where a more\r\ntender Sweet Cherry cannot be grown.\r\n\r\nThis variety, of ancient and unknown origin, dates back at least to 1792\r\nwhen Truchsess received it from Christ under the names Grosse\r\nFrühkirsche and Englische Erzherzogskirsche, both of which were\r\nincorrect, the first because it was not characteristic since the fruit\r\ndid not ripen early, and the second because it denoted a class of\r\ndark-fleshed cherries. In France, Double Glass has long been cultivated\r\nunder the name Amarelle Double de Verre. The variety was brought to\r\nAmerica from Russia in 1883 by Professor J. L. Budd. While grown for a\r\ntime in the Central States it was never highly regarded and has now\r\nnearly passed from cultivation. The following description is a\r\ncompilation:\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading becoming divergent with\r\n    age, usually hardy, rather unproductive; branchlets thick,\r\n    reddish-brown; leaves healthy, small to medium, ovate, with\r\n    serrated margins; buds large, prominent.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the latter part of June; usually large,\r\n    roundish-oblate, with a very deep suture; color light red becoming\r\n    much darker at maturity; stem long, thick; skin thin, tough,\r\n    translucent; flesh yellowish, with abundant uncolored juice, firm,\r\n    tender, sprightly; good in quality; stone medium in size, roundish.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE NATTE\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    1.

Cultural tests soon demonstrated, however, that\r\nmost of the varieties were comparatively worthless; Double Natte is one\r\nof these. It is a very mediocre cherry of the Morello group in nowise\r\nequal to English Morello except when earliness is a prime requisite,\r\nthis sort being one of the earliest of the Morellos. In flavor it is\r\nequal to English Morello but is no better. At Geneva the trees are\r\nseldom very fruitful. From the eulogistic reports of its behavior in the\r\nMiddle West it would seem that it was better adapted to Iowa, for\r\ninstance, than for New York.\r\n\r\nThis variety was first mentioned by Knoop, the Dutch pomologist, in\r\n1771--origin not given. Some years ago Professor J. L. Budd also\r\nimported from Russia a cherry under the name Riga No. 18. This cherry\r\nhas been grown as a separate variety under the name Riga but the\r\ndescriptions of it are all identical with those of Double Natte and\r\nthere can be no doubt but that they are one and the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE NATTE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, somewhat\r\n    vasiform, productive; trunk and branches smooth; branches brown\r\n    nearly covered with ash-gray, with a few large lenticels;\r\n    branchlets long, with short internodes, brown partly covered with\r\n    ash-gray, smooth, with a few very large, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and three-eighths inches long, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, folded upward, short-obovate, thick,\r\n    stiff; upper surface glossy, slightly rugose; lower surface pale\r\n    green, thinly pubescent; apex sharp-pointed, tapering toward the\r\n    base; margin coarsely serrate, glandular; petiole thick, dull red,\r\n    grooved on the upper surface, nearly one inch long, glandless or\r\n    with one or two small glands at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds conical or pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds and in small clusters on spurs; leaf-scars inconspicuous;\r\n    season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches across; borne in scattering clusters in twos and threes;\r\n    pedicels one inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube\r\n    with a faint reddish tinge, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    tinged red, long, acute, glabrous within and without, reflexed;\r\n    petals obovate, entire, tapering to short, narrow claws, with a\r\n    broad but shallow notch at the apex; filaments about one-fourth\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\n    cordate to conical, compressed; cavity somewhat abrupt, regular;\r\n    suture deep, distinct, often extending entirely around the fruit;\r\n    apex depressed; color dark red; dots numerous, small, brownish,\r\n    obscure; stem slender, one and three-fourths inches long, adheres\r\n    strongly to the fruit; skin thin, tough, separating readily from\r\n    the pulp; flesh dark red, with reddish juice, tender and melting,\r\n    sprightly, sour; good to very good in quality; stone nearly free,\r\n    longer than wide, nearly round, slightly flattened, with smooth\r\n    surfaces; somewhat ridged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNER\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kenrick _Am.

Several defects keep\r\nit from being of any considerable worth; it thrives only in the choicest\r\nsoils; the trees are often unhealthy as well as lacking in vigor; the\r\nflesh is thin and the stone is large; and, though the cherries set\r\nabundantly, the yield is small because the fruits are small. So, while\r\nthe variety is almost indispensable in a home orchard, ripening after\r\nalmost all of the dessert cherries have gone, Downer has small place in\r\na commercial plantation. It should be said further in its favor,\r\nhowever, as a commercial fruit, that it stands harvesting and shipping\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nDowner takes the name of Samuel Downer, Dorchester, Massachusetts, who\r\ngrew it some time before 1832 when it first found a place in pomological\r\nworks. It was included by the American Pomological Society in its\r\nschedule of fruits in 1848 as Downer's Late. It now appears as Downer\r\nwith Downer's Late Red as a synonym in accordance with the rules of the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOWNER]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, productive;\r\n    trunk thick, with shaggy bark; branches thick, roughened, dark\r\n    brown overspread with dark gray, with numerous large lenticels;\r\n    branchlets slender, long, brown partly covered with ash-gray,\r\n    smooth, with inconspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three inches long, one and three-fourths inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, obovate, rather stiff; upper surface dark\r\n    green; lower surface light green, hairy along the veins; apex\r\n    acute, base abrupt; margin doubly serrate, glandular; petiole one\r\n    inch long, thick, dark red, grooved, glandless or with from one to\r\n    three large, globose or reniform glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, except the terminals which are large, pointed, plump,\r\n    free, arranged singly as lateral buds, or in small clusters\r\n    on short spurs; leaf-scars prominent; flowers white, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches across; borne in thin clusters in ones and in\r\n    twos; pedicels variable in length often one inch long, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-tube faintly tinged with red, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes tinged with red, acuminate, glabrous within and\r\n    without, reflexed; petals roundish, entire, somewhat sessile, with\r\n    a shallow notch at the apex; pistil glabrous, nearly equal to the\r\n    stamens in length, often defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures among the latest; three-fourths of an inch in\r\n    diameter, roundish-cordate, slightly compressed; cavity very\r\n    shallow, flaring; suture obscure; apex variable in shape usually\r\n    somewhat pointed; color light to dark red frequently showing an\r\n    amber background on the shaded side; dots numerous, small, russet,\r\n    inconspicuous; stem one and three-fourths inches long, adherent\r\n    to the fruit; skin tough, separating from the pulp; flesh pale\r\n    yellow, with colorless juice, somewhat stringy, tender, with soft\r\n    flesh, mild and pleasant, sweet when fully ripe; good to very\r\n    good in quality; stone large, free, ovate, flattened, with smooth\r\n    surfaces; somewhat ridged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYEHOUSE\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Horticulturist_ =25=:176, 177. 1870. =2.= Downing _Fr.

Early Richmond is the standard early cherry yet\r\nDyehouse is a week earlier, just as attractive in appearance and equally\r\nwell flavored. It is near of kin to Early Richmond but the two may be\r\ndistinguished by the difference in time of ripening and by its brighter,\r\nclearer color, greater opaqueness, more highly colored juice and\r\nslightly smaller size. Possibly this cherry would supersede the\r\nbetter-known Early Richmond were it not for the defect in size and for\r\nthe further faults of being less productive and more capricious to\r\nenvironment, as it fails to thrive in localities where the older sort\r\nis quite at home. It is a worthy rival of Early Richmond, however, and\r\nought to be grown both for home and commercial purposes far more than it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nTo H. T. Harris of Stamford, Kentucky, belongs the honor of introducing\r\nthis well-known cherry. Although its parentage is unknown, it is almost\r\ncertain that a Mr. Dyehouse, Lincoln County, Kentucky, raised the tree\r\nfrom a pit sixty or more years ago. At the time of its introduction its\r\ncharacteristics were not clearly drawn and many believed it to be the\r\nEarly Richmond. In time, however, differences were shown, as we have set\r\nforth in the preceding paragraph. It was added to the fruit list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society in 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYEHOUSE]\r\n\r\n    Tree small, vigorous, spreading, with drooping branchlets, dense,\r\n    round-topped, productive; trunk and branches slightly roughened;\r\n    branches reddish-brown covered with dark ash-gray, with large,\r\n    elongated, raised lenticels; branchlets slender, willowy, variable\r\n    in length, brown overspread with ash-gray, smooth, with a few\r\n    small, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three inches long, one and one-half inches wide,\r\n    slightly folded upward, obovate to long-oval; upper surface\r\n    very dark green, smooth; lower surface light green, with a few\r\n    hairs along the midrib; apex acute, base variable in shape;\r\n    margin finely serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole one-half\r\n    inch long, tinged with dull red, with a few hairs along the\r\n    grooved upper surface, with from one to three small, globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly and in\r\n    clusters on short spurs; leaf-scars prominent; season of bloom\r\n    intermediate; flowers one inch across, white; borne in dense\r\n    but well-distributed clusters, usually at the ends of spur-like\r\n    branches, in twos, threes or fours; pedicels one and one-half\r\n    inches long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes tinged with red, serrate, glabrous within\r\n    and without, reflexed; petals roundish-obovate, entire, almost\r\n    sessile, with entire apex; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, nearly equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; more than one-half inch in diameter,\r\n    oblate, slightly compressed; cavity of medium depth, narrow,\r\n    abrupt, regular; suture indistinct; apex flattened, with a small\r\n    depression at the center; color dark red; dots numerous, small,\r\n    obscure; stem one inch long, adhering to the pulp; skin thin,\r\n    tough; flesh light yellowish-white, with pinkish juice, tender,\r\n    sprightly, tart; of very good quality; stone nearly free, ovate,\r\n    slightly flattened, with smooth surfaces; somewhat ridged along\r\n    the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAGLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

Were this choicely good cherry\r\nlarger in size, it would still be a prime favorite with growers for in\r\nmany respects it is one of the best varieties of its species. Its flavor\r\nis excellent; the trees are usually fruitful; it ripens at a good time\r\nin the cherry season, just after Black Tartarian; the cherries are less\r\nliable to crack than many of its rivals; and the trees are as hardy,\r\nhealthy and vigorous as those of any Sweet Cherry. Some complain that\r\nthe trees do not bear well at first but are productive only with age.\r\nBut, after all, it is its high quality that gives Eagle so much merit\r\nthat it ought not to be forgotten--makes it worth a place in every home\r\norchard and commends it highly to commercial growers of cherries who\r\nwant a finely finished product for either local or general market. The\r\nfruit-stems of this variety are characteristically long.\r\n\r\nEagle was grown about 1806 by Sir Thomas Andrew Knight at Downton\r\nCastle, Wiltshire, England, by fertilizing the Bigarreau of the old\r\nwriters, our Yellow Spanish, with pollen of the May Duke. The\r\ncorrectness of the parentage as given has been questioned because of its\r\ninherited characteristics. But if the May Duke is a hybrid between a\r\nSweet and a Sour, a pure Sweet offspring is not an impossibility. In\r\n1823, Honorable John Lowell of Massachusetts received Eagle from Knight.\r\nPrince mentioned this cherry in his _Treatise of Horticulture_, 1828,\r\nbut the exact date of its introduction into New York is unknown. In 1848\r\nit was placed on the list of fruits adopted by the National Convention\r\nof Fruit Growers and since then it has been retained on the fruit list\r\nof the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAGLE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense, unproductive at\r\n    first but improving with age; trunk and branches thick, smooth;\r\n    branches reddish-brown partly covered with ash-gray, with numerous\r\n    small lenticels; branchlets thick, brownish partly covered with\r\n    light ash-gray, the surface slightly ribbed and with small,\r\n    raised, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, five inches long, two and one-half inches wide,\r\n    folded upward, long, obovate to elliptical, thin; upper surface\r\n    dark green, rugose; lower surface light green, thinly pubescent;\r\n    apex variable in shape; margin coarsely and doubly serrate, with\r\n    dark glands; petiole nearly two inches long, tinged with red,\r\n    with a few hairs, with from two to four reniform, brownish glands\r\n    usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, conical or pointed, plump, free, arranged singly\r\n    as lateral buds and in clusters on spurs of medium length;\r\n    leaf-scars prominent; season of bloom medium; flowers white, one\r\n    and one-eighth inches across; borne in scattered clusters in twos\r\n    and threes; pedicels one inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green faintly tinged with red, campanulate; calyx-lobes\r\n    with a trace of red, obtuse, glabrous within and without,\r\n    reflexed; petals irregular-oval, crenate, with short, blunt claws\r\n    and with a crenate apex; anthers yellowish; filaments one-fourth\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; nearly one inch in diameter, oblate,\r\n    somewhat cordate, compressed; cavity regular, flaring; suture a\r\n    faint groove; apex pointed or slightly depressed; color dark red\r\n    almost black; dots small, russet, medium in number, obscure; stem\r\n    slender, two inches long; skin thin, tender; flesh dark red, with\r\n    wine-colored juice, meaty, tender, crisp, pleasant flavored, mild,\r\n    sweet; very good to best in quality; stone free except along the\r\n    ventral suture, rather small, ovate, slightly flattened, blunt,\r\n    with smooth surfaces; ridged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY MAY\r\n\r\n_Prunus fruticosa_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Langley _Pomona_ 86, Pl. 17 fig. 2. 1729. =2.= Prince _Pom.\r\n    Man._ =2=:131. 1832. =3.= Downing _Fr.

It is a true\r\ndwarf variety, the trees seldom attaining a height of more than six or\r\nseven feet. Both tree and branches are very flexible so that Early May\r\nis well adapted to the wall-training of European countries. It has\r\nfurther value in its earliness, being the earliest of all cherries. It\r\nis doubtful whether the variety can now be obtained in America but it\r\nought to be reintroduced both for the fruit and because it is a handsome\r\nornamental. Early May has several characters to recommend it to\r\nplant-breeders. The description herewith given is compiled from European\r\nfruit-books.\r\n\r\nPliny in his _Natural History_ mentions the Macedonian and the\r\nChamaecerasus cherries, both of which we now believe to have been\r\n_Prunus fruticosa_, the European Dwarf Cherry. Early May, according to\r\nEuropean botanists, is a variety of this dwarf species and may be the\r\nidentical cherry that Pliny described. Following Pliny it was mentioned\r\nby Estienne, a Frenchman, in 1540, by Knoop, the Dutch pomologist, in\r\n1771, by Parkinson, the English herbalist, in 1629, and, as the\r\nreferences show, by most pomologists since. The names May and Early May\r\nhave been applied to several varieties, and especially in the West to\r\nthe Early Richmond but all are distinct and ought not to be confused\r\nwith this, the true variety.\r\n\r\n    Tree very small, rather weak; branches numerous, slender, somewhat\r\n    curved, flexible, branchlets slender, pendant; leaves abundant,\r\n    very small, obovate or oblong, acuminate; margin irregularly and\r\n    deeply serrate; petiole short, slender, without glands; blooming\r\n    season very early; flowers small; petals oval.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very early, usually attached in pairs; small,\r\n    roundish, slightly flattened; suture indistinct; color bright red\r\n    becoming dark red at full maturity; stem one inch long, slender,\r\n    set in a small, regular cavity; skin thin; flesh yellowish-white,\r\n    sometimes tinged red under the skin, tender, juicy, brisk but\r\n    pleasant subacid; quality fair; stone very small, roundish.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY MORELLO\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Del.

Bul._ =73=:68, 77 fig. 17. 1903.\r\n\r\nThis, which we think is the true Early Morello, is worthy an extended\r\ndescription in _The Cherries of New York_ chiefly because there are\r\nseveral cherries of this name. The confusion results in much vexation to\r\ncherry-growers in the West where, only, these cherries have been\r\nplanted. The full description should make clear at least the character\r\nof the variety which is being grown at this Station as Early Morello.\r\nAbout all that can be said of the variety as it grows here is that the\r\ntrees are hardy, healthy, vigorous, fruitful and regular in bearing. The\r\ncherries show the variety to be of the Amarelle group but are such as to\r\nmake it far inferior to Montmorency and other well-known Amarelles. The\r\nname is misleading, as the variety has little in common, in tree or\r\nfruit, with the true Morellos.\r\n\r\nThe cherry described here as Early Morello was introduced by Professor\r\nJ. L. Budd from Orel, Russia, as Orel No. 23. It has proved very\r\nproductive and hardy throughout the West and resembles Early Richmond,\r\nthough smaller, a trifle darker, less acid and a week later. A\r\ndark-fleshed variety from Erfurt, Prussia, was sent out from Rosedale,\r\nKansas, where it is known as Early Morello. This, and one by D. U. Reed,\r\nBlue Springs, Nebraska, appear to be very similar to the Northwest, or\r\nWier No. 29.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, very productive;\r\n    trunk rather thick, shaggy; branches with numerous large\r\n    lenticels; branchlets slender, short; leaves two and three-fourths\r\n    inches long, one and one-half inches wide, thick, stiff, dark\r\n    green, rather glossy, smooth; margin finely and doubly serrate,\r\n    with small, dark glands; petiole glandless or with from one to\r\n    three small, globose, brown or yellowish glands variable in\r\n    position; buds small, short, obtuse, in small clusters at the ends\r\n    of slender, branchlike spurs; leaf-scars prominent; season of\r\n    bloom late; flowers one inch across; pistil equal to or slightly\r\n    longer than the stamens, sometimes defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; about three-fourths of an inch in\r\n    diameter, oblate, compressed; color attractive dark red; stem one\r\n    inch long, adhering to the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating\r\n    from the pulp; flesh light yellow, with pinkish juice, tender and\r\n    melting, sprightly, tart; of very good quality; stone free, ovate,\r\n    flattened, slightly pointed, with smooth surfaces, somewhat tinged\r\n    with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY PURPLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Book_ 195 fig. 1854.\r\n\r\nEarly Purple is a valuable cherry on account of its earliness, its\r\nattractive color and high quality. The trees bear well and regularly\r\nafter having become established in the orchard. The variety has the\r\nreputation of being a poor grower in the nursery and as a young tree in\r\nthe orchard but with age it takes on vigor and at all times is as\r\nhealthy as those of any Sweet Cherry. More than most cherries, this\r\nvariety responds to good care and a choice cherry soil--a warm,\r\nfree-working loam being best. A rather unusual and serious defect of\r\nthis variety is that the fruit-spurs are easily broken during picking\r\nand the crop of the next season thereby cut short. Another fault is that\r\nit is the favorite food of the robin where this, the worst of all cherry\r\npests, abounds. The cherries of this variety do not attain their rich\r\npurple color until full maturity is reached. Hogg, the English\r\npomologist, maintains that Early Purple does better on the Mahaleb than\r\non the Mazzard stock. No home collection should be without this variety\r\nand it can often be profitably grown as an early cherry for the local\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nEarly Purple is the Early Purple Guigne of most fruit-books, the name\r\nhaving been shortened by the American Pomological Society, though, since\r\nthe variety goes back to the Early Purple of Ray in 1688, the name here\r\nused has the right of precedence. As to what the origin and history of\r\nthe variety were before Ray mentioned it, we can find no record. Early\r\nPurple was brought to America over a hundred years ago. According to\r\nElliott, eastern growers received it directly from England, while in the\r\nWest it was brought over by a party of German emigrants, under the name\r\n\"German May Duke\" and as such it is still much grown in localities in\r\nthe Central West. In 1852, the American Pomological Society listed Early\r\nPurple as one of the promising new fruits and later, in 1856, it was\r\ngiven a place, which it has since retained, on the Society's catalog of\r\nfruits recommended for general cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY PURPLE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, very\r\n    productive; trunk thick, smooth; branches smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    partly covered with ash-gray, with large lenticels; branchlets\r\n    short, brown partly covered with ash-gray, roughened, with a few\r\n    small, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, four inches long, one and three-fourths inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, oval to obovate, thin; upper surface dark\r\n    green, rugose; lower surface light green, very lightly pubescent;\r\n    apex and base acute; margin finely serrate, with small, dark\r\n    colored glands; petiole one and three-fourths inches long,\r\n    slender, tinged with red, with few hairs, with two or three small,\r\n    globose, reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds variable in size and shape, rather long, plump, free,\r\n    arranged singly as lateral buds and in small clusters on spurs\r\n    variable in length; season of bloom early; flowers white, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches across; borne in scattering clusters, usually in\r\n    twos; pedicels characteristically long, often one and one-fourth\r\n    inches, slender, glabrous; calyx-tube with a faint tinge of red,\r\n    campanulate; calyx-lobes tinged with red, long, acute, serrate,\r\n    glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals broadly oval,\r\n    serrate, with short, blunt claws and a shallow, notched apex;\r\n    filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very early; one inch in diameter, cordate, slightly\r\n    compressed; cavity regular; suture a faint line; apex pointed;\r\n    color purplish-black; dots numerous, small, grayish, obscure; stem\r\n    tinged with red, slender, nearly two inches long, adhering to the\r\n    fruit; skin thin, tender, separating readily from the pulp; flesh\r\n    dark reddish-purple, with dark colored juice, tender, melting,\r\n    mild, sweet; of very good quality; stone free except along the\r\n    ventral suture, rather large, broadly oval, compressed near the\r\n    apex, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY RICHMOND\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Thacher _Am.

It is not a remarkable variety in its\r\nfruit-characters, the cherries being but medium in size, mediocre in\r\nquality and not handsomer than other Amarelles with which it belongs. It\r\nis, however, a very good culinary fruit and when well ripened may be\r\neaten out of hand with relish by those who like the refreshing acidity\r\nof a Sour Cherry. Though not in nearly as great demand for canning as\r\nMontmorency it still makes a very good canned product, being used more\r\nthan it otherwise would be to prolong the canning season because of its\r\nearliness. Before cherries were largely canned for the markets, Early\r\nRichmond was much used in making dried cherries, the product, rightly\r\ncured, making a delicious sweetmeat which would keep for several months.\r\nThe cherries are remarkable for the tenacity with which the stone clings\r\nto the stem. It is the tree in which the Early Richmond particularly\r\nsurpasses. It thrives in varied soils and climates from the St. Lawrence\r\nto the Carolinas and from the Atlantic to the Pacific--possibly the most\r\ncosmopolitan of all cherries--and everywhere vigorous, healthy and\r\nfruitful. For the many purposes for which it may be used and because of\r\nthe characters of the tree, Early Richmond is indispensable in every\r\nhome and commercial orchard for an early cherry. After Montmorency it is\r\nmore largely grown than any other cherry, Sweet or Sour, in New York.\r\n\r\nEarly Richmond is the old Kentish of English writers, confused more or\r\nless with the different Montmorencies. Whether or not this variety was\r\nintroduced into Kent, England, by the Romans and became thus early the\r\nKentish or whether it came from Flanders or Holland where it was called\r\nCerise de Volger, is not now certain. Probably, however, it is one of\r\nthe many seedlings of the Cerise Commune, as are the Montmorencies, and\r\nwas first known as Cerisier Hâtif. Early in the Sixteenth Century the\r\ngardener of Henry VIII made extensive plantings in Kent with trees\r\nsupposed to have come from Flanders, and Parkinson, in 1629, mentions a\r\nvariety as Flanders which was probably this cherry. The variety, soon\r\nknown by many English writers as Kentish, was confused by the French who\r\nseem to have had two Kentish cherries. In English nurseries Kentish was\r\nsoon confused with Montmorency. In this way the terms Kentish, Flanders,\r\nFlemish and Montmorency came into use for this sort. It was early\r\nbrought to America where it became known as Early Richmond but even here\r\nit has several names. The belief that it originated at Richmond,\r\nVirginia, was due to the fact that William Prince secured his first\r\ntrees from that source. By whom the variety was introduced into this\r\ncountry is unknown, although Thacher speaks of it as early as 1822. In\r\nthe South it became known as Virginia May, while in the West it has been\r\ncalled Early May. The variety appeared on the fruit list of the American\r\nPomological Society as Kentish in 1862 but in 1871 the name was changed\r\nto Early Richmond. It is listed by all prominent nurseries in this\r\ncountry as Richmond or Early Richmond while in England it is still known\r\nas Kentish. The French cherry, often spoken of as \"the common French\r\ncherry,\" introduced into the lower St. Lawrence region, is very similar\r\nto Early Richmond. This strain, propagated from seed or sprouts, seems\r\nto be somewhat hardier than Early Richmond and varies slightly from it\r\nin size and quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY RICHMOND]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense,\r\n    round-topped, productive; trunk and branches smooth; branches\r\n    reddish-brown lightly overspread with dull gray, with numerous\r\n    lenticels; branchlets slender, long, grayish, smooth, with\r\n    numerous small, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and one-half inches long, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, folded upward, obovate, thick;\r\n    upper surface dark green, smooth; lower surface pale green;\r\n    apex variable in shape, base abrupt; margin finely and doubly\r\n    serrate, glandular; petiole glandless or with one or two globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, obtuse, very plump, free, arranged singly and\r\n    in clusters on very short spurs; blooms appearing in mid-season;\r\n    flowers one and one-fourth inches across, white; borne in\r\n    scattering clusters, usually in twos and threes; pedicels\r\n    five-eighths inch long, glabrous; calyx-tube green or faintly\r\n    tinged with red, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes with a trace of\r\n    red, obtuse, serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed;\r\n    petals roundish, entire, sessile, with a shallow, wide notch at\r\n    the apex; filaments over one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; three-fourths inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oblate, compressed; cavity abrupt, regular; suture\r\n    indistinct; apex roundish or flattened, with a slight depression\r\n    at the center; color light red changing to dark red; dots\r\n    numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, one inch\r\n    long, adherent to the fruit; skin thin, rather tough, separating\r\n    from the pulp; flesh pale yellow, with light pinkish juice,\r\n    stringy, tender and melting, sprightly, pleasant flavored; good to\r\n    very good in quality; stone free, small, roundish-ovate, slightly\r\n    pointed, with smooth surfaces; somewhat roughened along the\r\n    ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nELKHORN\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Pom.

It was valued by\r\nthe old pomologists because of the large size of the fruit, the firm\r\nflesh, late ripening, rich flavor, and because it hangs well on the tree\r\nlong after maturity. But it fails in competition with other Bigarreaus\r\nin bearing cherries quite variable in size, in the diminishing size of\r\nthe fruit as the trees attain age and more than all else in being but\r\nmoderately productive. The bark of the trunk and main branches is so\r\nheavily overspread with gray as to make this a distinguishing mark. The\r\nfruit, too, is distinct in appearance by reason of the irregular surface\r\nof the skin. The variety possesses no characters, as it usually grows,\r\nto make it worth planting either for home or market.\r\n\r\nThe history of this old cherry was almost hopelessly confused by the\r\nearly horticulturists by the vast number of names they used for it, many\r\nof which belonged to other varieties. Elkhorn is supposed to have been\r\nraised by John Tradescant, gardener to Charles I of England, under the\r\nname Tradescant's Black Heart. Of this cherry, John Parkinson in 1629\r\nsays: \"John Tradescantes Cherrie is most usually sold by our Nursery\r\nGardiners, for the Archdukes cherrie, because they have more plenty\r\nthereof, and will better be increased, and because it is so faire and\r\ngood a cherrie that it may be obtruded without much discontent: it is a\r\nreasonably good bearer, a faire great berrie, deepe coloured, and a\r\nlittle pointed.\" It is not known when or how Elkhorn got to America.\r\nThe first cherry-grower in this country to mention it was William\r\nPrince, in 1832, who says that his father noticed the variety growing in\r\na garden next to a hotel in Maryland about 1797 and brought cions of it\r\nto New York afterwards propagating and selling it under the name Elkhorn\r\ngiven to the cherry by the hotel proprietor. Elkhorn was at one time\r\nvery popular and well disseminated throughout the United States and is\r\nsold now by a large number of nurserymen either under the name\r\nTradescant's Black Heart or as Elkhorn. In 1862, the American\r\nPomological Society listed in its fruit catalog Tradescant's Black Heart\r\nbut dropped it in 1877. In 1899 this Society placed the variety in its\r\ncatalog under the name Elkhorn and it still remains on its list of\r\nrecommended fruits. From its history it is apparent that this cherry is\r\nrightly called Tradescant or Black Heart or by some combination of these\r\nterms but Elkhorn has been adopted by the American Pomological Society,\r\nis everywhere in common use on this continent and is so distinctive that\r\nwe choose for this text the newer name.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, very vigorous, upright, open-topped, moderately\r\n    productive; trunk stocky, smooth; branches stout, smooth, with\r\n    numerous small lenticels, reddish-brown heavily overspread with\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets thick.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and three-fourths inches long, two and\r\n    one-fourth inches wide, short-oval to obovate, thin; upper surface\r\n    medium green, roughish; lower surface dull, light green, lightly\r\n    pubescent; apex acute; margin coarsely serrate, glandular; petiole\r\n    with from one to three raised glands of medium size, variable in\r\n    shape, usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in late mid-season; three-fourths of an inch in\r\n    diameter, cordate to conical, slightly compressed; cavity deep,\r\n    wide, flaring; suture indistinct; apex roundish or pointed,\r\n    with a slight depression at the center; color purplish-black;\r\n    dots numerous, small, dark russet, inconspicuous; stem one and\r\n    three-eighths inches long, adhering to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    tender, adhering somewhat to the pulp; flesh a characteristically\r\n    dark purplish-red, with very dark colored juice, meaty, firm,\r\n    crisp, mild, sweet; of good quality; stone semi-free, ovate,\r\n    flattened, slightly pointed, with smooth surfaces, tinged with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nELTON\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

The variety is distinguished by the\r\nform, color, flesh and flavor of its fruit. The cherries are\r\noblong-heart-shaped--possibly too much drawn out for best appearance and\r\noften too oblique; the color, very well shown in the color-plate, is\r\nmost attractive and makes up for any defect in shape--a dark red mottled\r\nwith amber, very bright, clear and glossy; the flesh, a little too soft\r\nto ship well, is delicate and most pleasing to the palate; the flavor is\r\npeculiarly rich and luscious being hardly surpassed by that of any other\r\ncherry. The trees may be as readily told as the fruit, by the unusually\r\ndark red color of the petioles of the leaves. The branches are stout and\r\nbear the crop thickly placed close to the wood and in prodigious\r\nquantities. Unfortunately it has a fault which in America, at least,\r\nmakes it almost unfit for a commercial plantation. Brown-rot, the\r\nscourge of the Sweet Cherry, attacks this variety more aggressively than\r\nalmost any other sort and for this reason, while its merits can hardly\r\nbe too highly spoken of, Elton must remain for most part a variety for\r\nthe home orchard. The tree, perfect in most respects, is a little tender\r\nto cold. Leroy, the French pomologist, thinks it does better on Mahaleb\r\nthan on the Mazzard stock.\r\n\r\nThis is another cherry from Thomas Andrew Knight, the great English\r\npomologist. Knight fruited it first about 1806, the tree coming from a\r\npit of Yellow Spanish, the paternal parent being White Heart. From the\r\nfirst it took a high place in English and continental pomology as it did\r\nalso in America upon being brought here in 1823. The variety is\r\neverywhere known and grown in America and is for sale by many\r\nnurserymen. Elton was one of the fruits to receive attention at the\r\nfirst meeting of the American Pomological Society in 1848, and in 1852\r\nwas put on the list of recommended fruits where it still remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELTON]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, very\r\n    productive; trunk thick, smooth; branches smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    covered with ash-gray, with small lenticels; branchlets long,\r\n    brown partly covered with ash-gray, smooth, with inconspicuous,\r\n    raised lenticels, intermediate in number and size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, five and one-half inches long, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, long-obovate to elliptical, thin;\r\n    upper surface dark green, rugose; lower surface light green,\r\n    thinly pubescent; apex acute, base abrupt; margin doubly serrate,\r\n    with small, dark glands; petiole two inches long, heavily tinged\r\n    with red, with a few scattering hairs along the upper surface,\r\n    with from two to four reniform or globose, reddish-brown glands on\r\n    the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds and on very short spurs variable in size; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent; mid-season in blooming; flowers one and one-half\r\n    inches across, white; borne in twos and threes; pedicels one inch\r\n    long, slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes tinged with red, long, broad, acute,\r\n    serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals roundish,\r\n    entire, nearly sessile, with a shallow notch at the apex;\r\n    filaments about one-half inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; about one inch long, three-fourths inch wide,\r\n    cordate to conical, somewhat compressed and oblique; cavity rather\r\n    abrupt, regular; suture indistinct; apex distinctly pointed; color\r\n    dark red with an amber tinge, faintly mottled; dots numerous,\r\n    small, light yellow, obscure; stem slender, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches long; skin thin, tender, separating from the pulp; flesh\r\n    white with a tinge of yellow, with colorless juice, slightly\r\n    stringy, tender, very mild, sweet; of good quality; stone free\r\n    except along the ventral suture, one-half inch long, long-ovate,\r\n    slightly flattened, with smooth surfaces; somewhat ridged along\r\n    the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPRESS EUGENIE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

Cat._ 22. 1883.\r\n\r\nThis old French cherry, for many years largely advertised and widely\r\nsold in America, does not thrive in the New World as well as the reports\r\nsay it does in the Old World. The two faults that condemn it, as it\r\ngrows here, are that the cherries ripen very unevenly making several\r\npickings necessary and the trees are so small that, though loaded with\r\nfruit, the total yield is not large. Lesser faults are that the cherries\r\nare not uniform in shape and are borne thickly in close clusters so that\r\nwhen brown-rot is rife this variety suffers greatly. The short stem,\r\ntoo, prevents easy picking. To offset these faults Empress Eugenie has\r\nto its credit the reputation of being about the most refreshing and\r\ndelicious Duke. In a home plantation where the unevenness in ripening\r\ncan be utilized to prolong the season and where dwarfness may not be\r\nundesirable, Empress Eugenie may well find a place.\r\n\r\nThis cherry appeared in 1845 as a chance seedling on the grounds of M.\r\nVarenne at Belleville, near Paris, France. It first fruited about 1850\r\nand four years later the Horticultural Society of Paris placed it, under\r\nthe name Impératrice Eugenie, on its list of recommended fruits. M. A.\r\nGontier, a nurseryman at Fontenay-aux-Roses introduced it to commerce\r\nin 1855. Empress Eugenie soon became quite generally disseminated\r\nthroughout Europe and was considered nearly as good as May Duke, with\r\nwhich it has occasionally been confused. It must have been brought to\r\nAmerica towards the beginning of the last quarter of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury and here it gradually became widely distributed until today it\r\nis found in all the leading cherry plantations and is propagated by a\r\nlarge number of nurserymen throughout the United States. The American\r\nPomological Society added this cherry to its fruit catalog list in 1877\r\nunder the name Empress Eugenie. In 1883 this name was shortened to\r\nEugenie under which term it has since appeared in the Society's catalog.\r\nIn _The Cherries of New York_ we have not adopted the shortened name as,\r\nby such a change, all trace is lost of the person after whom the cherry\r\nwas christened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMPRESS EUGENIE]\r\n\r\n    Tree small, not very vigorous, upright, becoming round-topped,\r\n    very productive; trunk slender, roughish; branches slender, much\r\n    roughened, reddish-brown partly covered with ash-gray, with\r\n    numerous small lenticels; branchlets with short internodes, brown\r\n    slightly covered with ash-gray, smooth except for the numerous\r\n    small, conspicuous, much-raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and one-half inches long, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, folded upward, obovate, thick; upper\r\n    surface dark green, slightly rugose; lower surface light green,\r\n    thinly pubescent; apex abruptly pointed, base variable in\r\n    shape; margin doubly serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    three-fourths of an inch long, tinged with red, with a few hairs\r\n    along the upper surface, glandless or with one or two small,\r\n    globose, greenish-yellow or reddish glands, usually at the base of\r\n    the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral buds and on\r\n    long or short spurs, in clusters variable in size; leaf-scars\r\n    obscure; blooming in mid-season; flowers one and one-fourth inches\r\n    across, white; borne in very dense clusters, in threes and fours;\r\n    pedicels one inch long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube with a\r\n    faint tinge of red, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes with a trace\r\n    of red, acute, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish, entire, with short but distinct claws; apex nearly\r\n    entire; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-conic to oblate-conic, compressed; cavity narrow; suture\r\n    very shallow, indistinct; apex flattened or depressed; color\r\n    dark red; dots numerous, small, dark russet, obscure; stem one\r\n    and one-fourth inches long, adherent to the fruit; skin tough,\r\n    separating from the pulp; flesh pale red, with pinkish juice,\r\n    tender, meaty, sprightly, pleasant flavored, tart; of good\r\n    quality; stone semi-clinging, small, ovate, flattened, somewhat\r\n    oblique, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH MORELLO\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

It\r\nis not a table fruit and can hardly be eaten out of hand until it loses\r\nsome of its astringency and acidity by thorough ripening. In any way the\r\ncherries are prepared by cooking, however, it is one of the best,\r\nculinary processes giving the fruits a rich, dark wine color, very\r\nattractive in appearance, and a most pleasant, sprightly, aromatic\r\nflavor. The fruit is handsome in appearance, bears harvesting and\r\nshipping well, is resistant to brown-rot and hangs long on the trees\r\nafter ripening, often until the last of August if robins can be kept\r\naway. Once seen, one may always know the trees. They are small,\r\nround-headed, with branches that distinctly droop. To be sufficiently\r\nproductive an English Morello orchard must be closely set; for, though\r\nthe trees are vigorous and productive for their size, they are too dwarf\r\nto yield heavily. The trees are hardy but not always healthy and are not\r\nadapted to as great a diversity of soils as might be wished. The variety\r\ndistinctly fails in its tree-characters. The demand for English Morello\r\nhas recently decreased and it is doubtful if it ever regains its\r\npopularity of a decade ago. There is a place for a late cherry which\r\nEnglish Morello now fills but not sufficiently well.\r\n\r\nAll of the early pomologists describe a Morello or a Morella but no one\r\nof them definitely gives its place of origin. The concensus of opinion\r\nis that it originated in either Holland or Germany from whence it was\r\nintroduced into England and later into France. The early German writers\r\nlisted a Grosse Lange Lothkirsche which is English Morello. Preceding\r\nthem, Duhamel described the Grosse Cerise à Ratafia \"as one praised for\r\nconfitures and preserving,\" which is probably this cherry. Leroy\r\nbelieved English Morello to be the cherry that Mortillet brought to\r\nParis from Holland calling it Griotte du Nord though he thought the\r\nvariety had been grown in France for many years previous but under\r\nanother name. It is possible that the term Du Nord originated through\r\nits being widely grown as an espalier demanding a northern exposure,\r\nrather than as some have thought, because it came from northern Germany.\r\nIn 1862 English Morello was put on the fruit list of the American\r\nPomological Society where it still remains. Wragg is thought to be\r\nidentical with this cherry by some and, if not, it differs but little.\r\nNorthern Griotte and Grosse Lange Lothkirsche, introduced by Budd from\r\nRussia, are English Morello. Morris, or Colorado Morello, put out by\r\nJohn Morris of Golden, Colorado, once thought to be distinct, is also\r\nEnglish Morello.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH MORELLO]\r\n\r\n    Tree small, upright-spreading, with drooping branchlets,\r\n    dense-topped, productive; trunk slender, rough; branches slender,\r\n    smooth, dark brown overlaid with dark ash-gray, with numerous\r\n    small lenticels; branchlets slender, willowy, with short\r\n    internodes, brownish, smooth, with numerous conspicuous, small,\r\n    slightly raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, two and three-fourths inches long, one and\r\n    one-half inches wide, folded upward, obovate to oval; upper\r\n    surface dark green, smooth; lower surface light green; apex acute,\r\n    base variable in shape; margin finely serrate, with small, dark\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, tinged with dull red, grooved,\r\n    with from one to three small, globose or reniform, greenish-yellow\r\n    glands at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds; leaf-scars obscure; season of bloom late; flowers one inch\r\n    across, white; borne in scattering clusters in twos and threes;\r\n    pedicels nearly one inch long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube with\r\n    a faint tinge of red, somewhat campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    with a trace of red, obtuse, serrate, glabrous within and without,\r\n    reflexed; petals distinctly veined, roundish, crenate, sessile,\r\n    with crenate apex; filaments one-fourth of an inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; about three-fourths of an inch in\r\n    diameter, sometimes running larger, roundish-cordate, slightly\r\n    compressed; cavity shallow, narrow, flaring, regular; suture a\r\n    shallow groove; apex roundish, with a small depression at the\r\n    center; color very dark red becoming almost black; dots numerous,\r\n    small, dark russet, conspicuous; stem slender, one inch long,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating from the\r\n    pulp; flesh dark red, with dark colored juice, tender and melting,\r\n    sprightly, tart; of good quality; stone free, small, ovate,\r\n    slightly flattened and pointed, with smooth surfaces, slightly\r\n    tinged with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORENCE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

The fruit hangs on the tree in edible condition an almost\r\nphenomenal length of time which has given rise to much divergence of\r\nopinion as to its season, some pomologists rating it as early, others as\r\nmid-season and still others as late. At Geneva the trees of this variety\r\nare not as healthful, vigorous or as fruitful as those of Yellow\r\nSpanish, with which it must compete, nor are the cherries quite as fine\r\nin appearance or quality.\r\n\r\nThis variety was found in Florence, Italy, early in the Nineteenth\r\nCentury by John Houblon, who took it to England from whence it was\r\nbrought to America. It found a place in 1885 on the fruit list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society where it remained until 1891, when it was\r\ndiscarded, with quite sufficient reason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLORENCE]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright, open-topped, productive; trunk and\r\n    branches thick, smooth; branches reddish-brown partly overspread\r\n    with ash-gray, with numerous lenticels; branchlets thick, long,\r\n    brown partly covered with ash-gray, smooth, with inconspicuous,\r\n    raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, variable in size, averaging four and one-fourth\r\n    inches long, two and one-fourth inches wide, folded upward,\r\n    long-oval to obovate, thin; upper surface rather dark green,\r\n    rugose; lower surface dull light green, thinly pubescent; apex\r\n    acute, base abrupt; margin coarsely and doubly serrate, glandular;\r\n    petiole one and three-fourths inches long, thick, pubescent, dull\r\n    red, with from two to four large, reniform, reddish glands on the\r\n    stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds pointed, plump, free, arranged as lateral buds and grouped\r\n    in large clusters on numerous short spurs; season of bloom\r\n    intermediate; flowers one and one-fourth inches across, white;\r\n    borne in dense clusters in twos and threes; pedicels three-fourths\r\n    of an inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes greenish, acute, glabrous within\r\n    and without, reflexed; petals broad-obovate to oval, entire, with\r\n    very short, blunt claws, distinctly notched at the apex; filaments\r\n    nearly one-half inch long; pistil glabrous, usually shorter than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; one inch in diameter, cordate, compressed;\r\n    cavity deep, wide; suture very shallow; apex somewhat pointed;\r\n    color reddish over an amber background, marked with indistinct,\r\n    whitish spots and streaks; dots numerous, small, whitish,\r\n    inconspicuous; stem one and one-half inches long, adherent to the\r\n    fruit; skin thin, separating from the pulp; flesh yellowish-white,\r\n    with colorless juice, tender, meaty, crisp, sprightly, sweet; of\r\n    very good quality; stone clinging, cordate, flattened, blunt, with\r\n    roughish surfaces; enlarged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE GLASS\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mich.

It is of the Amarelle group and cannot compete\r\nwith the many good varieties of its kinship, as the Early Richmond or\r\nthe several Montmorencies. Its season is between Early Richmond and\r\nMontmorency. As compared with the last-named variety, the standard Sour\r\nCherry, the fruit of George Glass is smaller, sourer, less attractive in\r\nappearance and the trees are far less fruitful. Possibly the trees are\r\nmore hardy, this character commending it for the colder parts of the\r\nMississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this variety is uncertain but it is supposed to have been\r\nintroduced into Iowa by immigrants from northeastern Germany. In\r\nAmerican collections it has often been confused with Brusseler Braune\r\nand Bessarabian and by some is declared to be identical with the latter\r\nsort. It is supposed to be a cross between a Duke and a Morello cherry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE GLASS]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, rather open, hardy,\r\n    appears unproductive; trunk thick; branches thick, roughened,\r\n    with numerous conspicuous, raised lenticels; leaves numerous,\r\n    four inches long, two inches wide, obovate, thick, stiff, dark\r\n    green; petiole three-fourths of an inch long, tinged with red,\r\n    with a few hairs along the upper surface, with one or two small,\r\n    globose, reddish-orange glands, usually at the base of the blade;\r\n    buds intermediate in size and length; leaf-scars prominent; season\r\n    of bloom intermediate; flowers one and one-fourth inches across;\r\n    borne in dense clusters.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; three-fourths of an inch long,\r\n    one inch wide, oblate, compressed; cavity deep; color light\r\n    red changing to dark red; stem one and one-eighth inches long,\r\n    adherent to the fruit; skin separating from the pulp; flesh\r\n    yellowish-white, with abundant colorless juice, stringy, tender\r\n    and melting, rather mild for a sour cherry; good to very good in\r\n    quality; stone free, roundish or slightly oblate, plump, blunt,\r\n    with smooth surfaces; ventral suture prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEART-SHAPED WEICHSEL\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Truchsess-Heim _Kirschensort_. 573-577. 1819. =2.= Dochnahl\r\n    _Führ.

The fruit is scarcely edible until dead\r\nripe and even then is too puckering to eat out of hand with relish. The\r\ncherries are very attractive, being large for the kind, heart-shaped,\r\nof a handsome, clear, glossy dark purple color and very uniform in all\r\ncharacters. The tree is conspicuous because of its symmetrical shape,\r\nlarge size, round head and its many branches and branchlets. The leaves\r\nare characteristically small, as are the flowers, which are further\r\ndistinguished by very narrow petals. The tree is hardy and productive\r\nand quite worth a place on a lawn as an ornamental if not in the garden\r\nfor its fruit. The variety has several characters to commend it to\r\nplant-breeders.\r\n\r\nThis variety came to light in written records in the early part of the\r\nNineteenth Century in German fruit-books under the name Saure\r\nHerzkirsche or Herzkirschweichsel and was highly recommended for its\r\nfine flavor. Professor J. L. Budd of Iowa, in one of his European trips,\r\nwas impressed with its symmetrical habit of growth and its abundant\r\nfoliage where he found it growing in eastern Europe as a lawn tree. He\r\nincluded it among his importations but it has not proved valuable in the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    unproductive; branches rather slender, smooth except for the\r\n    large, conspicuous lenticels; branchlets slender, long; leaves\r\n    numerous, two and three-fourths inches long, one and three-eighths\r\n    inches wide, obovate to oval, thin, dark green, smooth; petiole\r\n    over one-half inch long, tinged with red, with from one to three\r\n    small, globose, greenish-yellow or brownish glands at the base of\r\n    the blade; buds intermediate in size and length, usually obtuse;\r\n    season of bloom late; flowers one inch across; borne in scattered\r\n    clusters; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil slightly shorter\r\n    than the stamens, often defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; about three-fourths of an inch in\r\n    diameter, roundish-conic, slightly compressed; color very dark,\r\n    dull red; stem slender, one and one-fourth inches long, adhering\r\n    to the fruit; skin thin, tough; flesh very dark red, with dark\r\n    wine-colored juice, tender, rather meaty, very astringent, sour;\r\n    of poor quality; stone nearly free, small, ovate, flattened,\r\n    pointed, with roughish and colored surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILDESHEIM\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Pom.

The cherry mentioned by Duhamel, in 1768, as\r\na late Guigne with red fruit, otherwise known as Guigne de Fer, can be\r\nno other than Hildesheim. The exact origin of the variety has never been\r\nknown, though it is supposed to have sprung up in the neighborhood of\r\nHildesheim, Prussia. It was brought to America early in the Nineteenth\r\nCentury, probably by William Prince. With it came some of the numerous\r\nforeign names. It seems certain that Late Red Guigne mentioned by Prince\r\nwas Hildesheim. Ripening late and being small and of rather undesirable\r\ntexture, Hildesheim did not meet with much favor in America, never being\r\nwidely disseminated, and has long since passed from cultivation. This\r\nvariety, under the name Belle Agathe, was propagated in Belgium by M.\r\nThiery about 1852 and for some time was supposed to be a separate sort.\r\nThe following description is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, upright, hardy, an annual bearer,\r\n    unproductive while young producing good crops later; branches\r\n    thick, large, long, straight; leaves numerous, of medium size,\r\n    oval or elongated-oval, acuminate; margin finely and regularly\r\n    serrate; petiole slender, rather short, tinged red, with large,\r\n    flattened glands; blooming season early.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late, usually attached in fives but sometimes\r\n    in threes and fours; small to medium, roundish-cordate, flattened\r\n    on one side, somewhat irregular; color yellowish, mottled and\r\n    marbled with dark red; stem two inches long, slender, somewhat\r\n    curved; skin thick; flesh pale yellow, slightly tinged with red at\r\n    the pit, firm, somewhat stringy, rather dry, with uncolored juice,\r\n    pleasant flavored, sweet; quality good; stone medium to large,\r\n    with reddish surface, long, compressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDA\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

Cat._ 26. 1909.\r\n\r\nIda is a handsome, large, light red cherry resembling Napoleon in\r\nshape and Rockport in color, but differing from both in having soft\r\nflesh which places it among the Hearts rather than the Bigarreaus.\r\nBecause of beauty of the fruit, earliness and good tree-characters,\r\nIda promises to become a rather general favorite in home orchards\r\nthough it falls short of several others of its near of kin in flavor\r\nand flesh-characters. It can never take a high place among commercial\r\nkinds because the cherries are too soft to handle well, show bruises\r\nplainly, are somewhat susceptible to brown-rot and come when better\r\ncherries are plentiful. The trees are vigorous, hardy and bear full\r\ncrops regularly and in various environments. The variety is readily\r\ntold by the upright habit of growth and by the large lenticels on\r\ntrunk and branches. Ida has been very well tried as a commercial\r\nvariety in this State but in the ups and downs of the industry has not\r\nheld its own with other sorts and can be recommended only for home\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nE. H. Cocklin of Shepherdstown, Pennsylvania, grew this variety as a\r\nseedling of Cocklin's Favorite, another of his cherries. The cherry\r\nwas named after his daughter, Ida. It seems to have proved worthy of\r\ngeneral culture, as it is now listed by many nurserymen. The American\r\nPomological Society placed Ida on its fruit list in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IDA]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright, open-topped, somewhat vasiform,\r\n    very productive; trunk stout; branches very stocky, smooth, light\r\n    ash-gray over brown, with large, much-raised lenticels; branchlets\r\n    very stout, short, brown partly covered with ash-gray, roughish,\r\n    with a few raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and one-half inches long, two and one-half inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, elliptical to obovate, thin; upper surface\r\n    dark green, smooth; lower surface light green, pubescent along\r\n    the midrib and larger veins; apex taper-pointed, base acute;\r\n    margin doubly crenate, with small, black glands; petiole two and\r\n    one-fourth inches long, thick, tinged with red, somewhat hairy\r\n    along the grooved upper surface, usually with two large, reniform,\r\n    reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds and in dense clusters on numerous short spurs, also with\r\n    many small, round, lateral leaf-buds on the secondary growth;\r\n    leaf-scars not prominent; blooming in mid-season; flowers white,\r\n    one and one-fourth inches across; borne in clusters usually\r\n    in twos; pedicels three-fourths of an inch long, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, whitish within, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes with a tinge of red, acute, reflexed; petals roundish,\r\n    entire, dentate at the apex, nearly sessile; filaments nearly\r\n    one-half inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\n    cordate, slightly compressed; cavity deep, flaring, regular;\r\n    suture a distinct line; apex variable in shape; color amber\r\n    overspread with light red, mottled; dots numerous, rather large,\r\n    yellowish, somewhat conspicuous; stem one and one-half inches\r\n    long; skin thin, separating readily from the pulp; flesh whitish,\r\n    with colorless juice, tender and melting, mild, sweet; of good\r\n    quality; stone free or semi-free, roundish, slightly flattened,\r\n    blunt, with smooth surfaces; with distinct ridges along the\r\n    ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFREY DUKE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium × Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

Leroy\r\nmentions a Royale cherry which was introduced from England to France\r\nabout 1730 and was first grown by M. le Normand in the garden of Louis\r\nXV. The name Royale was first used by the French about 1735 from the\r\nfact that it was grown in the royal gardens and since that time this\r\nname has clung to the variety in most of the French plantations.\r\nAccording to English writers, the variety was brought to notice in\r\nEngland by Jeffrey, proprietor of the Brompton Nursery at Brompton\r\nPark, England, and from that time it was known as Jeffrey's Duke.\r\nEnglish pomologists maintain that Jeffrey renamed the old Cherry Duke\r\nof England, giving it his name. Jeffrey Duke appeared on the American\r\nPomological Society's fruit catalog list in 1862 but was dropped in\r\n1871. It is doubtful if the variety can now be found in America. The\r\nfollowing description is compiled from the authors given in the\r\nreferences:\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, very upright, unusually compact,\r\n    slow-growing, productive; branches very numerous, stocky,\r\n    straight, thickly set with fruit-spurs; internodes short;\r\n    branchlets very short; buds closely set; leaves numerous, medium\r\n    in size, oval or obovate, acuminate; margin finely and irregularly\r\n    serrate; petiole short, slender, with small, flattened or globose\r\n    glands; blooming season late; flowers small, very open.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season, usually attached in pairs; medium\r\n    in size, roundish, slightly flattened at the apex and base;\r\n    suture a well-marked line; color lively red becoming dark red\r\n    or almost black when fully ripe; stem slender, inserted in a\r\n    moderately broad, deep cavity; skin thin; flesh firm but tender,\r\n    yellowish-amber, with abundant colored juice, slightly stringy,\r\n    highly flavored; good in quality; stone small, roundish, tinged\r\n    with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING AMARELLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Christ Wörterb._ 293. 1802. =2.= Truchsess-Heim\r\n    _Kirschensort_. 610-615. 1819. =3.= Liegel _Syst.

It is of the Early Richmond type, differing from this\r\nstandard Amarelle in bearing fruit a little earlier, lighter in color\r\nand with a longer stem. The fault which all but condemns the variety\r\nas a commercial cherry is the small size of the fruit, the cherries\r\nrunning smaller than those of Early Richmond which, in its turn, is\r\nrather too small. The tree is very like that of Early Richmond--quite\r\nas vigorous and productive, the same in size and shape and, if\r\nanything, a little more hardy. The variety is told from afar in\r\nblossoming-time by the peculiar distribution of the flower-clusters,\r\nwhich are numerous and dense but always separated by several inches or\r\na foot of bare wood. King Amarelle can never displace Early Richmond\r\nbut might be tried where a somewhat hardier cherry is wanted or it\r\nmight be planted as a substitute where the better-known sort fails.\r\n\r\nThis variety, of old and uncertain origin, sprang up in France about\r\nthe same time as the Montmorencies and became confused with them. In\r\nboth fruit and tree-characters, however, King Amarelle is very\r\ndifferent from the Montmorencies, being more like Early May but\r\nripening later and making a larger tree. The cultivation of King\r\nAmarelle never became extended in Europe because of the inferior\r\nquality of the fruit and poor tree-characters. Professor J. L. Budd\r\nbrought the variety to America from Russia about 1883. The Royal\r\nAmarelle, grown on the Canadian Experiment Station grounds in 1900, is\r\nundoubtedly King Amarelle. The American Pomological Society placed it\r\non its list of recommended fruits in 1909.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    very productive; trunk roughish; branches rather slender, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown overlaid with dark ash-gray; branchlets slender,\r\n    of medium length, with short internodes, brown partly covered\r\n    with ash-gray, smooth, with numerous conspicuous, small, raised\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves three and one-half inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, obovate, somewhat glossy, thick; upper\r\n    surface dark green, rugose; lower surface light green, with a\r\n    few scattering hairs; apex acute, base abrupt; margin finely and\r\n    doubly serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole one inch long,\r\n    somewhat slender, lightly tinged with red, with a few hairs on the\r\n    grooved upper surface and with from one to three small, globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, obtuse, very free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds and in clusters on few, short spurs; leaf-scars prominent;\r\n    season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches across; borne in dense clusters usually in threes; pedicels\r\n    over one-half inch long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube with\r\n    a tinge of red, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes faintly tinged\r\n    with red, acute, serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed;\r\n    petals somewhat obovate, entire, with an entire apex; filaments\r\n    one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in\r\n    length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; three-fourths inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oblate, compressed; cavity regular, somewhat abrupt;\r\n    suture indistinct; apex roundish or flattened; color bright red;\r\n    dots numerous, small, light russet, rather conspicuous; stem one\r\n    inch long, adhering to the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating\r\n    from the pulp; flesh pale yellow, with colorless juice, tender and\r\n    melting, sprightly; fair to good in quality; stone free, ovate,\r\n    somewhat flattened, pointed, with smooth surfaces, faintly tinged\r\n    with red; ridged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIRTLAND\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

The fruit, too, as may\r\nbe seen from the color-plate, is handsome, the cherries resembling the\r\nwell-known Napoleon but being a little darker in color. The flesh is\r\nfirm and meaty and stands handling well and also resists the brown-rot\r\nas well as any other cherry. With these splendid qualities of fruit,\r\nKirtland would long ago have been one of the standard commercial\r\ncherries were its tree-characters better. Wherever tried, the\r\ncomplaint comes that the trees lack vigor and can be grown\r\nsuccessfully only on choice cherry soils and under the best of care.\r\nWith these faults the variety can be recommended only for home\r\norchards and for local markets where there is demand for a very early\r\nBigarreau, since this variety ripens before most other cherries of its\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nKirtland was grown in 1842 by Professor J. P. Kirtland of Cleveland,\r\nOhio, and ranks foremost in quality and appearance of all the\r\nseedlings raised by this well-known cherry-breeder. The American\r\nPomological Society, in 1852, mentioned this sort as deserving of\r\nfurther trial and, in 1854, listed it among the varieties of promising\r\nfruits. Elliott, in his _Fruit Book_, noted this cherry under the name\r\nKirtland's Mary, in honor of Professor Kirtland's daughter, and\r\nclassed it as a variety worthy of general cultivation. Hogg, in 1866,\r\ndropped the name Kirtland and listed it as Mary, while in the\r\n_American Pomological Society's Special Report_ for 1905 it is called\r\nKirtland. According to the rules of pomological nomenclature, Hogg was\r\ncorrect in holding the name Mary but, since there is another Mary and\r\nno worthy sort bearing the name of so eminent a horticulturist as\r\nProfessor Kirtland, this Station follows the American Pomological\r\nSociety in the use of Kirtland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KIRTLAND]\r\n\r\n    Tree small, rather weak, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    productive; trunk and branches slender, smooth; branches\r\n    reddish-brown partly overspread with ash-gray, with numerous\r\n    lenticels; branchlets thick, brown almost entirely overspread with\r\n    ash-gray, smooth except for the longitudinal, conspicuous, raised\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five inches long, two and one-fourth inches wide, folded\r\n    upward, elliptical to obovate, thin; upper surface medium green,\r\n    somewhat glossy, smooth; lower surface light green, thinly\r\n    pubescent; apex acute, base abrupt; margin doubly serrate, with\r\n    small, dark glands; petiole one and three-fourths inches long,\r\n    slender, tinged with red, lightly pubescent along the upper side,\r\n    with two or three reniform, reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral buds or\r\n    on numerous, very short spurs in clusters variable in size;\r\n    leaf-scars prominent; blooming in mid-season; flowers white, one\r\n    and one-fourth inches across; borne in dense clusters; pedicels\r\n    one inch long, pubescent, reddish-green; calyx-tube tinged with\r\n    red, light green within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    reddish, obtuse, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish-oval, entire, with short, broad claws and a notched\r\n    apex; filaments in four series, the longest one-half inch; pistil\r\n    glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\n    cordate, compressed; cavity wide, flaring; suture a more or less\r\n    distinct line; apex roundish or pointed, with a small depression\r\n    at the center; color amber overspread with bright red; dots\r\n    numerous, small, grayish, conspicuous; stem one and three-fourths\r\n    inches long, adhering to the fruit; skin tough; flesh whitish,\r\n    with colorless juice, tender, meaty, with a pleasant and\r\n    refreshing flavor; very good to best in quality; stone free,\r\n    small, roundish-ovate, with smooth surfaces; ridged along the\r\n    ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNIGHT\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Possibly Knight is to be\r\nfound in dooryards and home gardens in Eastern United States as often as\r\nany other Sweet Cherry with the exception of Black Tartarian. The\r\ncharacters which give it popularity are excellent quality, handsome\r\nappearance because of its glossy, dark purple color and uniformity in\r\ncolor, shape and size, and its earliness, it being the earliest good\r\nSweet Cherry. Unfortunately, even in the best soil and under the most\r\npainstaking treatment, the cherries run small, a defect for American\r\nmarkets. The small size also leads to comparatively low yields even\r\nthough the fruits are often borne in prodigious numbers. Knight, in\r\nsize, color and flavor, is much like Black Tartarian but the cherries\r\nare smaller and ripen earlier. As the trees grow on the grounds of this\r\nStation they are about all that could be desired in a Sweet Cherry. The\r\ntrees are characteristically marked by smooth bark which is dotted with\r\nlarge lenticels. There are now better sweet varieties than Knight for\r\nmost purposes but still this old variety has too many merits, especially\r\nfor home grounds, to be wholly forgotten.\r\n\r\nKnight comes from a seed of May Duke crossed with Yellow Spanish by T.\r\nA. Knight, Downton Castle, Wiltshire, England, about 1810. The new\r\nvariety sprang into prominence almost immediately, being mentioned by\r\nFrench, German and English writers. Knight is still one of the\r\nwell-recognized sorts in Europe and America and has appeared\r\ncontinuously on the fruit list of the American Pomological Society since\r\n1848. Mathieu has included several synonyms under this head which we\r\nquestion as we believe they belong to the Guigne Noir Hâtive, a distinct\r\nvariety though very similar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KNIGHT]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright-spreading, open-topped, very\r\n    productive; trunk stocky, variable in smoothness; branches smooth,\r\n    light reddish-brown nearly overspread with ash-gray, with small\r\n    lenticels; branchlets thick, brown lightly covered with ash-gray,\r\n    variable in smoothness, with small, raised, inconspicuous\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, five and one-half inches long, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, obovate to long-oval, thin; upper\r\n    surface dark green, rugose; lower surface light green, thinly\r\n    pubescent; apex and base variable in shape; margin doubly serrate,\r\n    with small, dark glands; petiole two inches long, slender, tinged\r\n    with red, with a shallow groove and with few hairs, with two or\r\n    three large, reniform, reddish glands, usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds long, conical or pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds and in small clusters on spurs variable in length;\r\n    leaf-scars prominent; season of bloom intermediate; flowers white,\r\n    one and one-fourth inches across; borne in dense clusters, usually\r\n    in twos; pedicels one inch long, slender, glabrous; calyx-tube\r\n    green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes lightly tinged with red,\r\n    long, acute, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals oval,\r\n    entire, deeply notched at the apex; filaments nearly one-half inch\r\n    long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; three-fourths of an inch in diameter, cordate\r\n    to conical; cavity wide, rather abrupt; suture indistinct; apex\r\n    flattened, with a small depression at the center; color dark\r\n    reddish-black, obscurely mottled; dots numerous, small, russet,\r\n    obscure; stem slender, one and one-half inches long, adhering well\r\n    to the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating from the pulp; flesh\r\n    dark red, with dark colored juice, tender, meaty, mild, sweet; of\r\n    good quality; stone free except along the ventral suture, small,\r\n    roundish-ovate, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMBERT\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

From these\r\nStates, more particularly Oregon, several meritorious cherries have been\r\nadded to pomology. One of the best of these is Lambert, now a standard\r\nsort in its native State but still on probation in Eastern America.\r\nLambert is a Bigarreau, a seedling of Napoleon by Black Heart, and a\r\nworthy rival of its parents in most respects and superior in some. In\r\nappearance, Lambert is more like its male than its female parent, having\r\nmuch the same shape and color, but it is larger, more rotund, smoother,\r\nclearer and brighter--one of the handsomest of the dark-colored Sweets.\r\nThe flesh and flavor leave little to be desired; the flesh is\r\npurplish-red marbled with lighter red, firm, meaty and juicy, with a\r\nsweet, rich flavor that at the first taste one marks very good. The tree\r\nis strong, vigorous, healthy and usually fruitful and regular in\r\nbearing. The fruit sets in great, loose clusters--often a dozen or more\r\ncherries to the fruit-spur. The leaves are remarkably large and dark\r\ngreen, the foliage betokening the vigor of the variety. Lambert is well\r\nworthy thorough testing for either home or market wherever the Sweet\r\nCherry can be grown.\r\n\r\nLambert originated as a seedling under a Napoleon tree which was planted\r\nby the late Henderson Lewelling[80] about 1848 in the orchard of J. H.\r\nLambert, Milwaukee, Oregon. This seedling, supposed to have been a cross\r\nbetween Napoleon and Black Heart, was grafted to May Duke and later\r\ntransplanted. About 1880, the top died and a sprout from the seedling\r\nstock formed a new top. Mr. Lambert gave the new variety his name and in\r\n1895 turned over his stock to the Oregon Horticultural Society with the\r\nexclusive right to propagate. The variety was placed on the fruit list\r\nof the American Pomological Society in 1899 where it still remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMBERT]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large in size and vigor, upright-spreading, very\r\n    productive; branches smooth, dull reddish-brown, with numerous\r\n    small lenticels; branchlets thick, long, dark reddish-brown nearly\r\n    covered with ash-gray, smooth, glabrous, with a few inconspicuous\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves four and one-fourth inches long, two and one-half inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, oval to obovate, thin; upper surface medium\r\n    green, smooth; lower surface light green, lightly pubescent; apex\r\n    acute, base abrupt; margin doubly serrate, glandular; petiole one\r\n    and one-half inches long, dull red, glandless, or with from one to\r\n    three rather small, globose, reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, pointed or conical, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds or in small clusters on short spurs; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent; season of bloom intermediate, short; flowers one and\r\n    one-fourth inches across, white; borne usually in twos; pedicels\r\n    three-fourths of an inch long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube\r\n    green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes long, broad, obtuse,\r\n    finely serrate; petals roundish, entire, with short claws and with\r\n    dentate apex; filaments one-half inch long; pistil glabrous, equal\r\n    to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; one inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-cordate, compressed; cavity rather deep, slightly\r\n    flaring; suture shallow, often a mere line; apex roundish,\r\n    depressed at the center; color very dark red changing to\r\n    reddish-black; dots numerous, small, russet, obscure; stem tinged\r\n    with red, slender, one and one-fourth inches long, adherent to\r\n    the fruit; skin thin, adhering to the pulp; flesh dark red, with\r\n    scant dark red juice, meaty, firm, pleasant flavored, sweet; of\r\n    very good quality; stone clinging, large, wide, ovate, flattened,\r\n    blunt, oblique, with smooth surfaces; prominently ridged along the\r\n    ventral suture.\r\n\r\n    [80] Little is known of the early life of Seth and Henderson\r\n    Lewelling. They were of Welsh ancestry and both were born in\r\n    Salem, North Carolina, Henderson on the 25th of April, 1809, and\r\n    Seth on the 6th day of March, 1819. Henderson died in California\r\n    December 28th, 1878, while Seth died in Milwaukee, continued:\r\n    Oregon, February 21st, 1897. When the boys were still very young\r\n    their parents moved from North Carolina to Ohio and founded the\r\n    town of Salem in Ross County; later they moved to Indiana where\r\n    their father established a nursery and became one of the pioneer\r\n    fruit-growers of what was then the West and here again they\r\n    founded a town of Salem. We next hear of Henderson Lewelling\r\n    in Salem, Henry County, Iowa, the town of his naming, with the\r\n    statement that in 1837 he planted a small nursery of 35 varieties\r\n    of apples and some peach, plum and cherry trees.\r\n\r\n    The history of the Lewellings now becomes more definite for we\r\n    have it from Seth Lewelling[81] (we spell the name as does he\r\n    and not \"Luelling\" as do many in writing of him) that in March,\r\n    1847, Henderson Lewelling planted an assortment of apples, pears,\r\n    peaches, plums and cherries and loaded them into two wagons and\r\n    started to Oregon. This traveling nursery was on the road from\r\n    March to November and one can imagine the labor of watering and\r\n    caring for the trees in this trip across mountains and plains.\r\n    Henderson Lewelling formed a partnership with William Meek under\r\n    the firm name of Meek & Lewelling, Milwaukee, Oregon. Seth joined\r\n    his brother in the fall of 1850 bringing with him from the East\r\n    a considerable quantity of fruit seed. For the next few years\r\n    their nursery operations were on a large scale, over 100,000\r\n    grafts being planted in 1853. From time to time they made new\r\n    importations of plants and fruit seeds from the East. Seth says\r\n    that his brother quit the business and moved to California in\r\n    1853 and we hear no more of him until his death in 1878. In 1857,\r\n    the partnership between Meek and Seth Lewelling was dissolved\r\n    leaving the latter the owner of the Milwaukee nurseries. It was\r\n    in 1860 that Seth Lewelling raised his first seedling cherry,\r\n    the Republican, called by him Black Republican, which was sold\r\n    to George Walling of Oswego and Mr. Hanson of East Portland,\r\n    the proceeds bringing Lewelling $500. Mr. Lewelling counts the\r\n    Republican and Bing cherries and the Golden Prune as his most\r\n    notable contributions to pomology.\r\n\r\n    The Lewellings are types of fruit-breeders who have done noble\r\n    work for pomology in the settlement of all our states--men of\r\n    for indomitable courage and will who have bred and grown fruits\r\n    throughout their lives in spite of every adversity. Few other men\r\n    labored longer and more devotedly to improve the cherry than Seth\r\n    Lewelling.\r\n\r\n    [81] _Oregon St. Bd. Hort. An.

Were it not that\r\nthe true Montmorency is so much more fruitful than this larger-fruited\r\noffshoot of the same race of Amarelle cherries, Large Montmorency would\r\nbe a leading commercial Sour Cherry, for it is equal to the\r\nsmaller-fruited strain in all other characters with the advantage of\r\nsize. The relationship between this and the other Montmorencies is\r\napparent but Large Montmorency is easily distinguished by several marked\r\ncharacters from the common Montmorency, known by all, with which it is\r\nmost often confused. Its fruits are more often borne singly, are larger,\r\nhave a shorter, thicker stem, are more oblate and ripen a little\r\nearlier. The trees are more upright, with stouter branches and are far\r\nless fruitful. The flesh-characters of the two kinds are much the\r\nsame--excellent in both, the flavor being particularly refreshing to\r\nthose who like the acidity of the Sour Cherry. Large Montmorency has\r\nbeen tried and found so wanting in productiveness that it can rarely be\r\nrecommended as a commercial variety but it is much too good a fruit to\r\nbe wholly lost and should be grown by connoisseurs who want a large,\r\nfinely flavored Sour Cherry.\r\n\r\nThis variety has been much confused with other cherries, particularly\r\nMontmorency, Early Richmond and Short Stem Montmorency. Bradley, in\r\n1739, mentioned a Flemish cherry which undoubtedly was the Large\r\nMontmorency of today, for the name Flemish has rather commonly been\r\napplied to this sort since Bradley's time. There is no doubt but that\r\nLarge Montmorency sprang up about the same time as the true Montmorency,\r\nin the Montmorency Valley in France. It may have been a seedling of the\r\nCerise Hâtive, afterwards known as Early Richmond, though some writers\r\nare of the opinion that the Montmorencies and Cerise Hâtive were all\r\nseedlings of the old Cerise Commune. At any rate, there have come to be\r\nat least three distinct types of Montmorency: the true Montmorency with\r\nlong stems and moderate-sized fruit, called Montmorency à Longue Queue\r\nor, in America, Montmorency Ordinaire; the Large Montmorency with its\r\nlarge fruit and shorter, thicker stems, commonly known by the French and\r\nGerman writers as Montmorency à Gros Fruit, Gros Gobet, Grosse\r\nGlaskirsche von Montmorency and sometimes as Montmorency à Courte Queue;\r\nand the Short-Stem Montmorency, often called Montmorency à Courte Queue\r\nand sometimes Gros Gobet. Large Montmorency has often been sold for\r\nMontmorency, or for Early Richmond, hence the three varieties are more\r\nor less confused. Large Montmorency probably came to America about the\r\nsame time as Montmorency and Early Richmond, early in the Nineteenth\r\nCentury. In 1875, Ellwanger & Barry, Rochester, New York, disseminated\r\nthis sort quite extensively but later it proved too unproductive for\r\ncommercial use. It was soon replaced by the true Montmorency but often\r\nthe names were interchanged and large forms of the Montmorency were\r\nthought to be this variety. The unproductiveness of this cherry has been\r\nconsistently mentioned by nearly every writer from Duhamel's time to the\r\npresent. Large Montmorency was added to the American Pomological\r\nSociety's catalog list of fruits in 1885 as Montmorency Large but in\r\n1899 this name was changed to Large Montmorency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE MONTMORENCY]\r\n\r\n    Tree rather large, vigorous, upright, vasiform, unproductive;\r\n    trunk thick, roughened; branches stocky, nearly smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown overspread with dark ash-gray, with numerous\r\n    large, raised, conspicuous lenticels; branchlets thick, short,\r\n    brown tinged with bronze, smooth except for the large, numerous\r\n    yellowish, conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and one-half inches long, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, folded upward, broad-oval to obovate,\r\n    thick, stiff; upper surface dark green, slightly rugose; apex\r\n    acute, base variable in shape; margin serrate, glandular; petiole\r\n    one inch long, tinged with dull red, glandless or with from one to\r\n    three globose, yellow or brownish glands, usually at the base of\r\n    the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds usually pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral buds\r\n    and in small clusters on short spurs; leaf-scars prominent; season\r\n    of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one inch across; borne in\r\n    scattering clusters, usually in threes; pedicels five-eighths\r\n    inch long, glabrous, green; calyx-tube tinged with red, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes with a trace of red, long, broad, acute,\r\n    serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals obovate,\r\n    entire or slightly crenate, sessile, with a crenate apex;\r\n    filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to or\r\n    longer than the stamens, often defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\n    oblate, compressed; cavity wide, flaring; suture shallow; apex\r\n    flattened or depressed; color dark red; dots numerous, small,\r\n    russet, somewhat conspicuous; stem thick, one inch long, adhering\r\n    fairly well to the fruit; skin thick, separating from the pulp;\r\n    flesh whitish, showing distinctly the fibers in the pulp, with\r\n    abundant colorless or slightly tinged juice, tender and melting,\r\n    sprightly, pleasant flavored, tart; of very good quality; stone\r\n    free, roundish, plump, with smooth surfaces, tinged with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE DUKE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Pom.

The size, color, flavor and season of the fruit\r\nall commend it, as do the vigor, health and fruitfulness of the trees.\r\nThe cherries are not quite as sweet as those of May Duke, a little more\r\nmarbled in color of skin and ripen through a longer season. The trees\r\nare readily told from those of the earlier Duke, being more open and\r\nspreading, scanter of foliage, with slender branches and with fruit more\r\nthickly clustered along the branchlets. Ripening in a season when hybrid\r\nvarieties are gone or rapidly going, Late Duke is a valuable acquisition\r\nin the home orchard and for nearby markets to which tender-fleshed\r\nvarieties can be shipped. If those who want late cherries will plant\r\nthis variety on a northern slope, against a northern wall or where in\r\nany way shaded or in a cool soil, these delicious cherries can be had\r\nuntil well toward August. The tree is hardy and its blossoming-time is\r\nlate so that the variety is well adapted to northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this variety is unknown. In 1797, Christ mentions \"a true\r\nEnglish cherry\" which is probably Late Duke. At least Oberdieck, in\r\n1861, states that the true English cherry is identical with the Late\r\nDuke, or Anglaise Tardive. In 1823, Late Duke was introduced into\r\nEngland by the London Horticultural Society from M. Vilmorin, of Paris,\r\nunder the name Anglaise Tardive. Though the French name of this variety\r\nseems to indicate an English origin, the old English writers were not\r\naware of any cherry of this kind being in existence in England previous\r\nto its introduction by the Horticultural Society. Because of the close\r\nresemblance of Late Duke to May Duke it has often been confused with\r\nthat sort and by some writers was supposed to be a late strain of May\r\nDuke. The American Pomological Society listed Late Duke in its fruit\r\ncatalog in 1862.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATE DUKE]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright-spreading, becoming spreading at\r\n    maturity, open-topped, productive; trunk and branches slender;\r\n    branches brown overlaid with dark ash-gray, with numerous small\r\n    lenticels; branchlets slender, short, reddish-brown, with ash-gray\r\n    scarf-skin, with numerous conspicuous, small, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three inches long, one and three-fourths inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, obovate, thick; upper surface very dark\r\n    green, smooth; lower surface light green, with a few scattering\r\n    hairs; apex abruptly pointed; margin doubly crenate, with small,\r\n    dark glands; petiole one inch long, lightly tinged with red,\r\n    grooved and somewhat hairy on the upper surface, glandless or with\r\n    one or two small, reniform, greenish glands, usually at the base\r\n    of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, obtuse or conical, plump, free, arranged singly\r\n    and in clusters; leaf-scars prominent; season of bloom late;\r\n    flowers white, one inch across; borne in numerous, dense clusters,\r\n    in twos, threes and fours; pedicels one inch long, slender,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish, campanulate; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, obtuse, serrate, reflexed; petals roundish, entire, almost\r\n    sessile; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; one inch in diameter, blunt-cordate,\r\n    somewhat compressed; cavity wide; suture shallow; color dark\r\n    red; stem slender, one and one-half inches to two inches long,\r\n    deeply inserted; flesh amber-colored, with abundant juice, tender,\r\n    rich, sprightly subacid; stone semi-clinging, medium to large,\r\n    roundish-ovate, compressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE KENTISH\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

Though but little\r\nimprovement on the wild _Prunus cerasus_, the trees were so hardy,\r\nvigorous, healthy and productive that any who had a bit of spare land\r\ncould have cherries. This, therefore, became preeminently the \"pie\r\ncherry\" of New England and the North Atlantic States. The trees are\r\nlong-lived and even so late as a generation ago Downing says that this\r\nvariety is \"better known among us than any other acid cherry, especially\r\nabundant on the Hudson and near New York.\" The variety is never planted\r\nnow, having long since been superseded by better sorts, Early Richmond\r\nand Montmorency in particular, but it is still to be found as old trees\r\nor self-sown near where a tree of the variety formerly stood.\r\n\r\nLate Kentish and Early Richmond, the latter the Kentish of some authors,\r\nare much confused. Late Kentish is the old Pie Cherry of Colonial times.\r\nIt is a seedling sort belonging to America, having been planted along\r\nfences and roadsides in the earliest times. This cherry is mentioned by\r\nthe Pilgrims in 1620 and this and the May Duke were listed as market\r\nvarieties in Massachusetts. Many believe it to be a seedling of Early\r\nRichmond, sometimes, as we have seen, called Kentish, but this variety\r\nbeing two weeks later, received the name Late Kentish. The name was put\r\non the fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1873. The\r\nfollowing description is a compilation:\r\n\r\n    Tree small, bears annually, very productive, hardy.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures about two weeks after Early Richmond; medium or\r\n    below in size, roundish, flattened; stem one inch to one and\r\n    one-half inches in length, stout, straight; color deep, lively\r\n    red; flesh light colored, with abundant colorless juice, very\r\n    tender, sour, remaining quite acid even when fully ripe; stone\r\n    does not adhere to the stalk.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITHAUER\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

The variety is too poor in quality to be\r\nworth planting where the better but less hardy cherries will grow. We\r\ngreatly doubt whether it is worthy a place in the recommended list of\r\nfruits of the American Pomological Society. It is included here only\r\nbecause of the prominence given it by a place in the fruit list named.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the varieties imported from Russia by Professor J. L.\r\nBudd of Iowa, who reported that it was much grown in southwest Russia\r\nfor drying and in making cherry wine. As tested in various parts of this\r\ncountry Lithauer has proved of little value except in the extreme north.\r\nThe American Pomological Society, in 1909, listed this sort in its\r\ncatalog of recommended fruits for northern fruit regions. The following\r\ndescription is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, tall, weeping, hardy.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures from the middle to the last of July; small,\r\n    roundish, slightly oblate; stem long, averaging one and one-half\r\n    inches, slender; color dark purplish-red becoming almost black at\r\n    maturity; skin thick, tough; flesh dark red, with reddish juice,\r\n    firm, meaty, quite acid or bitter even when fully ripe; poor in\r\n    quality; stone variable in size, roundish.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUIS PHILIPPE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Elliott _Fr.

If the description and color-plates of this variety and\r\nOlivet be compared it will be found that the two cherries are nearly\r\nidentical. They differ only in season of ripening and in minor\r\ntree-characters which may be best summarized by the statement that this\r\ncherry has in the tree more of the aspect of a Morello than has Olivet.\r\nIt may be suspected that one or the other of the two varieties on our\r\ngrounds is misnamed but the descriptions of all who have described the\r\ntwo show that they are very similar, if not identical. The history of\r\nLouis Philippe, long known in America but little or not at all known in\r\nEurope, throws some light on the question of its distinctness from\r\nOlivet, the origin of which is known, inasmuch as Louis Philippe seems\r\nto be the older of the two. The value of the two varieties to\r\ncherry-growers is the same and is indicated in the discussion of Olivet.\r\n\r\nElliott,[82] the American pomologist, imported Louis Philippe from\r\nFrance in 1846 but the cherry does not seem to have been known at that\r\ntime in Europe and it is possible that Elliott gave it its name. For the\r\nfirst few years the variety was not given the recognition it deserved\r\nbut, in 1862, it was recognized by the American Pomological Society by a\r\nplace on its list of recommended fruits which it still holds under the\r\nname, Philippe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS PHILLIPE]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped; trunk and branches\r\n    intermediate in thickness; branches with numerous very large,\r\n    elongated, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, four and one-half inches long, two and one-eighth\r\n    inches wide, oval to obovate, thick, leathery; upper surface dark,\r\n    shiny green, smooth; lower surface olive-green, with a large,\r\n    prominent midrib; apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate, with\r\n    reddish-brown glands; petiole one inch long, usually with one or\r\n    two large, globose, yellowish-red, glands, variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flowers one and one-fourth inches across, white, well distributed,\r\n    mostly in threes; pedicels one inch long, thick, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes broad,\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals slightly\r\n    obovate, entire, broad, slightly notched at the apex; stamens\r\n    one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, equal in length to the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season or later; nearly one inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-ovate; cavity abrupt; suture very shallow to a mere line;\r\n    apex flattened, depressed; color very dark red; dots numerous,\r\n    unusually small, obscure; stem one and one-fourth inches to one\r\n    and one-half inches long, adhering well to the fruit; flesh light\r\n    red, with much wine-colored juice, fine-grained, tender and\r\n    melting, sour at first, becoming pleasantly tart at full maturity;\r\n    good in quality; stone separates readily from the flesh, small,\r\n    roundish-ovate, plump; ventral suture grooved; dorsal suture with\r\n    a small ridge.\r\n\r\n    [82] Elliott's _American Fruit Growers Guide_, published in\r\n    1858 and dedicated to Professor Jared P. Kirtland, was one of\r\n    the notable pomological books of its day. Cherry growers, in\r\n    particular, owe Elliott a debt of gratitude for the publicity that\r\n    he gave to Kirtland's cherries, having described in his book 20\r\n    of the sorts originated by Professor Kirtland. Beside his fruit\r\n    book he published _Popular Deciduous and Evergreen Trees_ (1868),\r\n    _Handbook for Fruit-growers_ (1876) and _Handbook of Practical\r\n    Landscape Gardening_ (1877). He also served pomologists well for\r\n    many years, at various times, from 1850 to 1873, as the secretary\r\n    of the American Pomological Society. Franklin Reuben Elliott\r\n    was born in Guilford, Connecticut, April 27, 1817. We know,\r\n    from complimentary speeches, accepted by Elliott, that he was a\r\n    descendant of John Eliot, \"The Apostle of the Indians.\" As a young\r\n    man he engaged with a brother in New York as an importer of dry\r\n    goods, the firm being rated at half a million dollars. Financial\r\n    ruin came through a disastrous fire and, in 1836, Elliott went to\r\n    Newburgh and was employed by A. J. Downing from whom he imbibed\r\n    his knowledge and much of his love for pomology and horticulture.\r\n    A roving disposition and dissipated habits led him to leave\r\n    Downing for a position with a relative near Cincinnati who was\r\n    a market-gardener. A ready pen seems from this time on to have\r\n    been his chief means of livelihood for we find him successively\r\n    in Cleveland, Ohio, and St. Louis, Missouri, in newspaper work;\r\n    after a few years in each place he wandered to Washington where he\r\n    was employed in the Agricultural Department of the Patent Office\r\n    illustrating American fruits. From his hand in the Patent Office\r\n    reports and from his fruit book, came some of the most accurate\r\n    and beautiful representations of the fruits of this continent.\r\n    It is probable that while in Washington he began work on his\r\n    _Fruit Growers Guide_, the time for which, he tells us in his\r\n    preface, took ten years. Social infirmities seem to have cost him\r\n    his position in Washington and his last employment was with the\r\n    _Cleveland Herald_, after which comes the record of his death\r\n    and burial in a pauper's grave January 10, 1878. One of the most\r\n    brilliant pomologists of his time, his career seems again and\r\n    again to have been checked by the weaknesses of his life; even so,\r\n    he rendered horticulture valuable services for which we must give\r\n    him gratitude and honor.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUTOVKA\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

Sta.\r\n    Bul._ =73=:189. 1897.\r\n\r\nFor a time Lutovka and Galopin were listed as two distinct varieties.\r\nUnquestionably they are the same despite the seeming difference in\r\norigin. All we know of Galopin is that it was said to have been\r\noriginated by a nurseryman in Belgium whose name it bears. The Lutovka\r\nwas introduced into this country by J. L. Budd of Iowa, in 1883, and,\r\naccording to the introducer, was well known in Poland and Silesia as a\r\nroadside tree. Nothing is said of it in foreign literature. As was the\r\ncase with many of Budd's importations, this variety did not stand the\r\ntest of culture. It is a shy bearer and is now seldom recommended,\r\nalthough it was placed on the list of desirable fruits of the American\r\nPomological Society in 1897 where it still remains. The variety has no\r\nvalue in New York. In 1895, this Station sent out buds which they had\r\nbeen led to believe were the Lutovka and which they later found to be\r\nBrusseler Braune. The following description is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree large, upright, slightly spreading; leaves large, ovate,\r\n    leathery, produced from short spurs along the main branches.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens the forepart of July; medium to above in size,\r\n    roundish-oblate; suture often a line, sometimes lacking; stem\r\n    short, stout, set in a large, deep cavity; skin dark, clear red,\r\n    thin, tough, translucent; flesh colorless, meaty, juicy, slightly\r\n    acid; quality good; pit large, roundish, free.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYONS\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    _Bigarreau de Lyon._ =1.= _Mag.

Though\r\ngrown for nearly a century in Europe it seems never to have been well\r\ntried in America probably because it has not been considered\r\nparticularly valuable in the Old World. From its behavior at this\r\nStation it appears to deserve extensive trial as an extra early market\r\ncherry for dessert purposes, as it is one of the few tender-fleshed\r\ncherries that give promise of standing handling for distant markets.\r\nThough commonly classed as a hard-fleshed Bigarreau it is really an\r\nintermediate between the firm-of-flesh cherries and the soft-fleshed\r\nHearts. In the tree it is a typical Bigarreau. Besides being one of the\r\nearliest of the Heart-like cherries it is one of the largest, handsomest\r\nand best flavored. Unfortunately, because of an accident, we cannot show\r\na color-plate of this splendid cherry. On these grounds the\r\ntree-characters are about all that could be desired, though we are\r\nmaking allowance for a slight lack of productiveness in the young tree\r\nwhich is one of the faults commonly attributed to Lyons by European\r\nwriters; however, all agree that the trees become fruitful with age. The\r\nblossoms of this variety are conspicuously large and showy, with pistils\r\nunusual in being longer than the stamens. The merits of Lyons have been\r\nso pronounced in the several years we have watched it that we feel quite\r\nwarranted in recommending it for both home and commercial orchards.\r\n\r\nAbout 1822, M. Jaboulay, a nurseryman at Oullins, near Lyons, France,\r\ngrafted over a number of seedling cherries which had sprung up on his\r\ngrounds. Five years later, having decided to dig out the trees, he was\r\nattracted by the superb growth made by one of them upon which the graft\r\nhad not started and ordered the tree to be saved. This tree produced a\r\nfull crop of exceedingly large and attractive fruit which matured far in\r\nadvance of other varieties. Jaboulay decided to save all the grafts for\r\npropagation the succeeding year but found upon going to the tree the\r\nfollowing spring that the wood had been stolen. About five years later\r\nM. Riviére, also a nurseryman at Oullins, placed upon the market at\r\nLyons a very early cherry which he called Bigarreau Anglaise but which\r\nwas recognized as the same as the one found by Jaboulay. Thus have come\r\nthe several names given in the synonyms. Lyons has never been much grown\r\nin this country. Lewis B. Eaton of Buffalo, New York, in importing\r\ncherry trees from France in 1841 and 1842, found among them one without\r\na label which turned out to be Bigarreau de Lyon, later the Lyons. Trees\r\nof this variety were received for testing at this Station from the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture under the name Hâtive de Lyons.\r\nThese, as grown here, have proved identical in both tree and fruit\r\ncharacters with the many descriptions of Bigarreau Jaboulay, or\r\nBigarreau de Lyon.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, a rapid grower, upright-spreading; branches\r\n    straggling, reddish-brown; branchlets thick, long, with\r\n    long internodes, grayish-brown, with numerous rather large,\r\n    conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, variable in size, averaging five and one-half\r\n    inches long, two and one-half inches wide, folded upward,\r\n    long-elliptical to obovate, thin; upper surface dark green,\r\n    smooth; lower surface light green, with few hairs; apex distinctly\r\n    elongated, base abrupt; margin coarsely serrate, with small, dark\r\n    glands; petiole often two inches long, thickish, pubescent on the\r\n    upper surface, glandless or with from one to six large, reniform,\r\n    reddish glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long, conical, free, arranged singly as lateral buds\r\n    and in small, scattering clusters; leaf-scars obscure; season\r\n    of bloom intermediate; flowers large, often one and one-half\r\n    inches across, white; borne in dense clusters, in twos and\r\n    threes; pedicels one inch long, glabrous, green with a trace of\r\n    red; calyx-tube distinctly reddish, somewhat obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes strongly tinged with red, broad, acute, glabrous\r\n    within and without, reflexed; petals obovate, entire, tapering\r\n    to distinct but short claws; apex entire or with a shallow, wide\r\n    notch; filaments five-sixteenths of an inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    equal to or longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; one inch in diameter, cordate, compressed;\r\n    cavity flaring; suture shallow, or a mere line, often extending\r\n    around the fruit; apex roundish or pointed; color very dark red;\r\n    dots numerous, small, russet; stem thick, one and one-half inches\r\n    long; skin thin, rather tender, separating from the pulp; flesh\r\n    reddish, with dark colored juice, meaty, sprightly, sweet; of\r\n    very good quality; stone semi-clinging, large, ovate, plump, with\r\n    smooth surfaces; ridged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNIFIQUE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium × Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

It has failed as a\r\ncommercial cherry because the crop ripens very unevenly, there being\r\nsometimes green and fully ripe cherries on the tree at the same time,\r\nthough the season is usually given as very late. This is one of the\r\nlightest in color of the hybrid Dukes, the Sour Cherry parent very\r\nevidently having been an Amarelle--a conclusion to which both fruit and\r\ntree point. The quality is usually counted as very good though it is too\r\nacid to be a first-rate dessert cherry for some. The trees are very\r\nvigorous and usually are fruitful. Magnifique has been grown so long\r\nthat its place in the orchard would seem to have been fixed by\r\nexperience; yet it might be made more than a cherry for the home orchard\r\nif some commercial grower would plant it in a shaded place and a cool\r\nsoil and thereby retard ripening time until other cherries were gone.\r\n\r\nThis valuable cherry was brought to notice in 1795 by Chatenay,\r\nsurnamed Magnifique, a nurseryman near Paris. It seems, at first, to\r\nhave been quite commonly called Belle de Chatenay but Belle de\r\nMagnifique became the commoner appellation ending in America at least\r\nwith the universal name \"Belle Magnifique.\" The variety was introduced\r\ninto America from France sometime before 1830, by General H. A. S.\r\nDearborn, Boston, Massachusetts, President of the Massachusetts\r\nHorticultural Society. The cherry is typically a Duke sort and is so\r\nlisted by most writers, though Downing in 1845 placed it with the\r\nMorello cherries. Magnifique was placed upon the fruit list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society in 1852 where it has since remained.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense, productive; trunk\r\n    and branches stocky, brown overlaid with dark gray; branchlets\r\n    with many, small conspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and one-half inches long, two inches wide,\r\n    obovate to oval, thickish; upper surface dark green, slightly\r\n    rugose; lower surface finely pubescent; apex abruptly pointed,\r\n    base variable in shape; margin finely serrate, with small, dark\r\n    glands; petiole one inch long, tinged with dull red, grooved on\r\n    the upper surface and with a few hairs, glandless or with one or\r\n    two small, reniform, greenish glands usually at the base of the\r\n    leaf.\r\n\r\n    Buds obtuse or conical, plump, free, arranged as lateral buds\r\n    or in rather dense clusters on short spurs; leaf-scars obscure;\r\n    season of bloom late; flowers white, one inch across, wide open;\r\n    borne in dense clusters on short spurs, usually in threes or\r\n    fours; pedicels one inch long, slender, glabrous, light green;\r\n    calyx-tube greenish, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes broadly\r\n    and shallowly dentate, glabrous within and without, reflexed;\r\n    petals obovate, entire, with very short claws, indented at the\r\n    apex; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; nearly one inch in diameter, cordate; cavity\r\n    rather deep; suture very shallow; color pale red changing to\r\n    bright red; dots numerous, small, russet, conspicuous; stem one\r\n    and one-fourth inches long; skin thick, tough, adherent to the\r\n    pulp; flesh whitish, with abundant colorless juice, fine-grained,\r\n    meaty but tender, pleasantly tart, sprightly; very good in\r\n    quality; stone free, small, oval, plump, slightly pointed, with\r\n    smooth surfaces; slightly notched near the base of the ventral\r\n    suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY DUKE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Bradley Gard._ 211. 1739. =2.= Duhamel _Trait.

There are several reasons why it has attained and\r\nholds its popularity. It is finely flavored, especially when prepared\r\nfor the table, and even before ripe; it is also delicious to eat out\r\nof hand if the cherries are dead ripe, when it is one of the best of the\r\nsubacid cherries; while one of the earliest of its class, it may be left\r\nto hang for a month or six weeks, becoming daily sweeter and more\r\naromatic; few or no cherries thrive in greater variations of soil and\r\nclimates, this fact accounting in greatest measure for its world-wide\r\ndistribution in temperate regions; despite its tender flesh, it ships\r\nwell though it is grown only for local markets since its long period of\r\nripening makes necessary several pickings--a fatal defect for a canning\r\ncherry or one for the general trade; lastly, the trees are as fruitful\r\nas any, and are hardy, vigorous and healthy. The fruit is remarkably\r\nwell distributed in dense clusters on trees characteristically upright\r\nand vasiform and bearing a heavy canopy of dark green, luxuriant\r\nfoliage. May Duke fills a particular place in the cherry orchard as a\r\nfruit for the local market and hundreds of new-comers have not been able\r\nto supplant it. The fact that it has lost none of its pristine vigor,\r\nhealth and productiveness in the two hundred and more years it has been\r\nknown contradicts the idea that varieties of fruit degenerate or wear\r\nout with age. When we pass in review all of the varieties of cherries,\r\nall characters and purposes considered, May Duke remains one of the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nThis variety seems to have been first mentioned by Ray in 1688. May Duke\r\nis supposed by some English writers to have originated in a district in\r\nFrance known as Médoc and the name to have been derived from the place.\r\nWhen this cherry first received attention, the old style of reckoning\r\ntime was in vogue and the 11th of June was the last day of May. It may,\r\ntherefore, be presumed that the variety derived its name from its season\r\nof ripening rather than from a corruption of Médoc. A few years ago\r\nProfessor J. L. Budd of Iowa imported from Russia several cherries among\r\nwhich was one called Esel Kirsche. Later this cherry was distributed by\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture. As grown on the grounds of\r\nthis Station, Esel Kirsche has proved to be May Duke. In Ohio the two\r\ncould not be distinguished and with this evidence we have listed Esel\r\nKirsche as a synonym of May Duke. In 1832, William Prince mentioned May\r\nDuke as being among the first of the cherries introduced to America from\r\nEurope. From the references to this variety in the horticultural\r\nliterature and in the nursery catalogs throughout the United States we\r\nmay say that it is one of the most widely distributed and best-known\r\ncherries in the country. The American Pomological Society placed May\r\nDuke on its fruit catalog list in 1848.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAY DUKE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, upright becoming somewhat vasiform and spreading with\r\n    age, open-topped, very productive; trunk of medium thickness,\r\n    somewhat shaggy; branches smooth or roughish, reddish-brown partly\r\n    covered with ash-gray, with numerous lenticels variable in size;\r\n    branchlets short, brown partly covered with light gray, smooth,\r\n    with small, inconspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and one-half inches long, two inches wide,\r\n    folded upward, obovate; upper surface very dark green, rugose;\r\n    lower surface thinly pubescent; apex abruptly pointed, base acute;\r\n    margin finely serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole one inch\r\n    long, slender, tinged with red, grooved, glandless or with one or\r\n    two small, globose, brownish glands, usually at the base of the\r\n    blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds obtuse, plump, free, in large clusters on short spurs;\r\n    leaf-scars prominent; season of bloom intermediate; flowers white,\r\n    one and one-fourth inches across; borne in dense clusters, in twos\r\n    and threes; pedicels one inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube with a tinge of red, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    with a trace of red, rather long, narrow, acuminate, glabrous\r\n    within and without, reflexed; petals broad-oval, entire, nearly\r\n    sessile; apex crenate; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early, although variable in habit; three-fourths\r\n    of an inch in diameter, cordate to conical, compressed; cavity\r\n    abrupt, regular; suture indistinct; apex roundish, with a small\r\n    depression at the center; color light changing to dark red at full\r\n    maturity; dots numerous, russet, obscure; stem slender, one and\r\n    one-half inches long, adhering strongly to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    tender, separating from the pulp; flesh medium to dark red, with\r\n    pinkish juice, tender and melting, sprightly subacid, pleasant\r\n    flavored; of very good quality; stone nearly free, small, roundish\r\n    to elliptical, with smooth surfaces; slightly ridged along the\r\n    ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCER\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

The trees are not sufficiently fruitful,\r\nthe cherries are too small, the flavor in none too good and the fruit is\r\nnot at all resistant to brown-rot--four fatal defects for a commercial\r\ncherry.\r\n\r\nThis variety is reported to have sprung from a pit of a Mazzard tree and\r\nwas introduced several years ago by Black & Son of Hightstown, New\r\nJersey.

Though on the recommended list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society and frequently spoken of in the pomological\r\nworks of the day and offered by some nurserymen, we have not been able\r\nto find many trees of this variety now growing in New York. We glean\r\nfrom the literature that Mezel pleased the eye more than the palate and\r\nthat the trees, while vigorous and healthy, were not productive. At any\r\nrate after a decade or two of much advertising and what would seem to\r\nhave been a very thorough trial, Mezel failed to receive very general\r\napprobation from cherry-growers and has now almost passed from\r\ncultivation. Contrary to the general behavior of the variety in New\r\nYork, the tree and fruit from which the accompanying description was\r\nmade have so many merits that one can well wish that the variety will\r\nnot wholly pass out of cultivation.\r\n\r\nThis variety was found at Mezel, Puy-de-Dôme, France, by M. Ligier\r\nsometime prior to 1846 when it was brought to notice. Even so, it had\r\ngrown in a vineyard at that place for thirty years and was only made\r\npublic after an excursion of several members of a horticultural society\r\nto the vineyard. It was immediately heralded as a coming variety and\r\ngrafts were distributed. Great Bigarreau, which made its appearance a\r\nfew years later, is here included as a synonym though many writers list\r\nit as a distinct sort. Bigarreau Monstrueux, first listed in the London\r\nHorticultural Society catalog for 1831, is held by many pomologists to\r\nbe identical with Mezel which, if true, casts some doubt on the\r\ngenerally accepted history of the variety. Mezel appeared on the fruit\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society in 1862 but was discarded in\r\n1869; it was replaced in 1883 and is still on the list though it is\r\nscarcely known in any part of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEZEL]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, variable in\r\n    productiveness; trunk stocky, nearly smooth; branches thick,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown partly overspread with dark ash-gray,\r\n    with lenticels medium in number and size; branchlets of average\r\n    thickness, variable in length, with internodes of medium length,\r\n    brown partly covered with ash-gray, smooth, glabrous, with small,\r\n    inconspicuous, raised lenticels medium in number.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, five inches long, often two and one-half inches\r\n    wide, long-oval, thin; upper surface dark green, strongly rugose\r\n    giving a crumpled appearance; lower surface dull, light green,\r\n    with slight pubescence; apex varies from abrupt to taper-pointed,\r\n    base abrupt; margin glandular, coarsely serrate; petiole long,\r\n    averaging one and one-half inches, slender, tinged with red, with\r\n    from one to four reniform glands of medium size on the petiole.\r\n\r\n    Buds intermediate in size and length, plump, pointed, arranged\r\n    singly as lateral buds or in clusters of various sizes on both\r\n    long and short spurs; leaf-scars prominent; season of bloom\r\n    intermediate; flowers one and seven-sixteenths inches across, well\r\n    distributed in scattering clusters in twos and threes; pedicels\r\n    one and one-eighth inches long, medium in thickness, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube with a slight tinge of red, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes long, medium in width, acute, slightly\r\n    serrate, glabrous within and without; petals somewhat obovate,\r\n    crenate, nearly sessile, with a very shallow notch at the apex;\r\n    anthers yellow; filaments shorter than the petals; pistil\r\n    glabrous, shorter than the stamens, often defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; large, seven-eighths inch long,\r\n    thirteen-sixteenths inch wide, cordate, compressed, the surface\r\n    markedly irregular and broken into ridges; cavity very deep,\r\n    wide, irregular, abrupt; suture variable, shallow to very deep\r\n    and wide and at times double; apex blunt-pointed, usually not\r\n    depressed; color attractive purplish-black; dots numerous, very\r\n    small, somewhat russet, obscure; stem medium in thickness, long,\r\n    averaging two and one-eighth inches, adheres well to the fruit;\r\n    skin medium in thickness, rather tender but not inclined to crack,\r\n    adheres slightly to the pulp; flesh purplish-red, with abundant\r\n    dark red juice, tender, meaty, mild, very pleasant, sweet; very\r\n    good to best in quality; stone clinging, large, strongly ovate,\r\n    with slightly roughish surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTMORENCY\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Duhamel _Trait.

No one\r\nquestions its supremacy. Probably half of the cherry trees in New York,\r\nSweet or Sour, are Montmorencies and at least three-fourths of all the\r\ntrees of the Sour Cherry are of this variety. It leads in the demands\r\nfor this fruit in the markets, for the cannery and for home use as a\r\nculinary cherry. Several characters give it first place. It is surpassed\r\nby no other Sour Cherry, in New York at least, in vigor, health and\r\nproductiveness of tree. In the last character, in particular, it is\r\nsupreme. Year in and year out, Montmorency trees are fruitful. Possibly,\r\ntoo, no other Sour Cherry is adapted to a greater diversity of soils\r\nthan Montmorency, which, with capacity to stand heat and cold, makes the\r\nvariety suitable to wide variations in environment. The cherries are in\r\nno way remarkable--not much above the average for an Amarelle in size,\r\nappearance or quality, in all of these characters being much inferior to\r\nLarge Montmorency. The fruit has the advantage of being presentable in\r\nappearance and fit for culinary purposes several days before it is fully\r\nripe and this adds to the value of the variety for the market. Brown-rot\r\ntakes less toll from this cherry than of others of its kind probably\r\nbecause of relatively firm flesh and thick skin. These characters, also,\r\nmake the fruit stand handling well in harvesting, shipping and on the\r\nmarkets. The preserved product, whether canned at home or commercially,\r\nis attractive in appearance and very good. Montmorency is not a dessert\r\ncherry but for those who like Sour Cherries it may be eaten out of hand\r\nwith relish when it is fully matured. Some maintain that the variety\r\nfalls short in the size of the tree, which is seldom more than medium,\r\nbut the head is spreading and much-branched and the fruit is borne in\r\nclusters thickly scattered throughout the whole head so that the total\r\nyield from a tree is greater than would be thought from its size. For\r\nany and all purposes to which Sour Cherries are put Montmorency may be\r\nrecommended as the best in its season.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately several quite distinct cherries bear the name Montmorency\r\nand it has been most difficult to separate them in pomological\r\nliterature. To make matters worse, all of them have been much confused\r\nwith other varieties, Early Richmond in particular. The different\r\nMontmorencies and Early Richmond originated in the Montmorency Valley,\r\nFrance, several centuries ago, at least before the Seventeenth Century,\r\nprobably as seedlings of Cerise Hâtive or of Cerise Commune. These\r\nMontmorency cherries differ from each other principally in their stems\r\nand fruit, one having long stems and moderate-sized, regular fruit; one\r\nshorter stems and larger fruit; and the third, very short, thick stems\r\nand oblate, irregular fruit showing a distinct suture. The first cherry\r\nhas been generally known, particularly among the French, as Montmorency\r\nà Longue Queue or sometimes Cerise de Montmorency. This is the\r\nMontmorency of this sketch. Duhamel, in 1768, was the first writer to\r\nmention this cherry directly and according to his statement it was then\r\nesteemed around Paris, being superior in productiveness to the Large\r\nMontmorency.\r\n\r\nMontmorency early found its way into England, where it soon became\r\nconfused with its probable parent, the French Cerise Hâtive or the\r\nEnglish Kentish. In a short time it had replaced Kentish in many\r\nnurseries and came to be called Kentish in much of the literature of the\r\ntime. Just when Montmorency was introduced to this country is not known\r\nbut it has been cultivated here under various names for many years.\r\nWilliam Prince spoke of it in 1832 as the Long Stem Montmorency and it\r\nhas long and commonly been known here as Montmorency Ordinaire.\r\nMontmorency is to be found in nearly every nursery in the United States\r\nunder various names, some nurserymen using the French name, others the\r\nEnglish, while still others are selling the variety as Large\r\nMontmorency. Many supposed strains have been given new names but it is\r\ndoubtful if any distinct strains of this cherry exist. The American\r\nPomological Society added Montmorency to its fruit catalog list in\r\n1897 using the qualifying term Ordinaire which was dropped in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTMORENCY]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, with the lower branches\r\n    inclined to droop, round-topped, productive; trunk and branches\r\n    smooth; branches reddish-brown tinged with light ash-gray, with a\r\n    few lenticels of medium size; branchlets slender, reddish-brown\r\n    partly overspread with ash-gray, smooth, with a few small,\r\n    inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves three inches long, one and one-half inches wide, folded\r\n    upwards or flattened, oval to obovate, leathery; upper surface\r\n    dark green, smooth; lower surface pale green, with a few\r\n    scattering hairs; apex and base variable in shape; margin doubly\r\n    crenate, glandular; petiole one inch long, tinged with dull red,\r\n    glandless or with from one to three small, globose, brownish or\r\n    yellowish glands, usually at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly or in clusters on short\r\n    spurs; leaf-scars obscure; season of bloom intermediate; flowers\r\n    white, one and one-fourth inches across; borne in scattered\r\n    clusters in twos and threes; pedicels one inch long, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes tinged\r\n    with red, broad, serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed;\r\n    petals roundish to obovate, crenate, with short, blunt claws and\r\n    shallow, crenate apex; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, equal to or slightly longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oblate, slightly compressed; cavity abrupt; suture very\r\n    shallow; apex roundish; color light to rather dark red; dots\r\n    numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous; stem thick, usually with\r\n    a faint tinge of red, one inch long, adhering well to the fruit;\r\n    skin thin, tender, separating from the pulp; flesh pale yellow,\r\n    with a reddish tinge, with abundant light pink juice, tender and\r\n    melting, sprightly, tart; of very good quality; stone free, small,\r\n    roundish-ovate, flattened, pointed, with smooth surfaces which are\r\n    tinged with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

It takes its place by\r\nvirtue of the large size, handsome appearance and high quality of the\r\nfruit and the phenomenal productiveness of the trees. The accompanying\r\nplate shows well the large size and beautiful color of the\r\ncherries--unsurpassed in either character by any other Bigarreau and\r\npossibly by any other cherry. The flavor is rich and sweet which, with\r\nthe abundant juice and firm, crackling flesh, makes this a most\r\ndelicious and refreshing cherry for dessert and, with the great size and\r\nattractive color, gives it preference over all other Sweet Cherries for\r\nculinary purposes. In particular, cherry-canners find that Napoleon\r\nmakes a finely finished product. The cherries carry well and keep long\r\nand are, therefore, well thought of by fruit-dealers. Besides being very\r\nproductive, the trees come in bearing early and are as vigorous, hardy\r\nand healthy as those of any other Sweet Cherry. They may usually be\r\nknown by their upright growth and large, sturdy limbs. Napoleon,\r\nhowever, is not without its faults. The cherries crack badly in wet\r\nweather and the variety can be grown with certainty only in the dry\r\nsummer climate of the Pacific Coast, where, especially in Oregon and\r\nWashington, it reaches truly wonderful perfection. In the East, too,\r\nNapoleon is more susceptible to brown-rot than several of its rivals.\r\nPossibly the greatest fault, however, is in the tree, which is very\r\nfastidious as to soils, thriving only in choice cherry land and in a\r\ncongenial cherry climate. Despite these rather serious faults,\r\ncherry-growers agree that Napoleon takes first place among Sweet\r\nCherries for both home and commercial plantings.\r\n\r\nNapoleon is of unknown origin. Early in the Eighteenth Century it was\r\ngrown by the Germans, French, Dutch and English, proof that it is a very\r\nold variety. Leroy believes that it was described by Merlet in 1667 but\r\nunder another name. The great number of synonyms in several languages\r\ngives some idea of the countries in which the variety has been grown\r\nas well as the esteem in which it has been held. There are several\r\naccounts as to when the cherry was given the name Napoleon. Probably the\r\nbest authenticated is that in which it is held that Parmentier, a\r\nBelgian, gave the cherry the name of the famous emperor in 1820. When\r\nthe variety was taken to England, where at that time Napoleon was not in\r\ngood repute, the name of his conqueror, Wellington, was substituted but\r\nseems to have been little used. As if not content with the score or more\r\nof European names, cherry-growers in America have added at least two\r\nmore. In many parts of the country it is locally called the Ox Heart. On\r\nthe Pacific Coast it is grown and sold by nurserymen and fruit-growers\r\nalike as Royal Ann, a name given it by its introducer, Seth Lewelling,\r\nof Milwaukee, Oregon, who lost the label bearing the old name in taking\r\nit across the Continent in early days and gave it a new name. With\r\nincomprehensible persistency Western horticulturists maintain this\r\nsynonym to the confusion of horticultural nomenclature. The American\r\nPomological Society placed Napoleon on its fruit list in 1862, it having\r\nbeen grown in America for at least 40 years before receiving this honor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPOLEON]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, very\r\n    productive; trunk thick, shaggy; branches thick, roughened by the\r\n    lenticels, dull brown overlaid with ash-gray, with numerous large,\r\n    raised lenticels; branchlets thick, long, light brown overspread\r\n    with gray, smooth, with a few inconspicuous, small lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, five and three-fourths inches long, two and\r\n    one-half inches wide, folded upward, elliptical to obovate; upper\r\n    surface dark green, rugose; lower surface light green, somewhat\r\n    pubescent; apex acute, base variable in shape; margin doubly\r\n    serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole one and one-fourth\r\n    inches long, thick, tinged with dull red, hairy along the upper\r\n    surface, with from one to three large, reniform, reddish-orange\r\n    glands, usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds variable in size, conical, free, arranged singly or in thin\r\n    clusters from lateral buds and from spurs; leaf-scars prominent;\r\n    season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one and one-half\r\n    inches across; borne in scattering clusters in ones or in twos;\r\n    pedicels variable in length, averaging one inch long, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    tinged with red, long, rather narrow, acuminate, serrate,\r\n    reflexed; petals oval, entire, dentate at the apex, with short,\r\n    narrow claws; filaments one-half inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    shorter than the stamens, often defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; over one inch in diameter, conical\r\n    to long-cordate, compressed; cavity deep, wide, flaring; suture a\r\n    distinct line; apex much pointed; color, varying shades of bright\r\n    red over a yellowish background, distinctly mottled; dots obscure;\r\n    stem slender, more than one inch long, adherent to the fruit; skin\r\n    thin, rather adherent; flesh whitish, with a faint yellow tinge,\r\n    with colorless juice, tender, meaty, crisp, mild, the flavor\r\n    improving as the season advances, sweet; good to very good in\r\n    quality; stone semi-clinging, small, ovate, flattened, pointed,\r\n    with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOUVELLE ROYALE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Flor. & Pom._ 72, Pl. 1862. =2.= _Gard.

In\r\nparticular, it would be commended by its product, the trees not making\r\nas good a showing as the fruit. The cherries are distinguished by their\r\nlarge size, dark red color, glossy surface, good quality, lateness in\r\nmaturity and, even more particularly, sweetness, keeping in mind that\r\nthe variety is a hybrid and not a true Sweet Cherry. The shape, too,\r\noffers a distinguishing character, the fruits being more oblate than in\r\nany other Duke. The long, stout stem is still another characteristic.\r\nUnfortunately the tree, while satisfactory in all other respects, is\r\nunproductive--a fatal fault in these days of commercial fruit-growing.\r\nNouvelle Royale is not widely known in America and may well be given\r\ntrial by those who want a late Duke.\r\n\r\nThis variety is supposed from its fruit- and tree-characters to be a\r\nhybrid between Early Richmond and May Duke but where, how and when it\r\ncame to light is not known. Downing, in 1869, mentions the Nouvelle\r\nRoyale as having recently been introduced into this country and it was\r\nnoted in the Report of the American Pomological Society for 1875 but has\r\nnever received a place upon the Society's fruit catalog list.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOUVELLE ROYALE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright, compact, moderately productive;\r\n    trunk of medium size; branches upright, thickish; branchlets\r\n    slender, long, brown partly covered with ash-gray, with very\r\n    numerous conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and one-half inches long, two inches wide,\r\n    folded upward, obovate; upper surface dark green, glossy, rugose;\r\n    lower surface light green, lightly pubescent; apex abruptly\r\n    pointed, base acute; margin finely and doubly serrate, glandular;\r\n    petiole one and one-fourth inches long, slender, tinged with dull\r\n    red, grooved and with few hairs along the upper surface, glandless\r\n    or with from one to four globose, greenish-yellow or reddish\r\n    glands variable in size usually at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds and on short spurs in clusters variable in size; leaf-scars\r\n    obscure; season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one inch\r\n    across; borne in dense clusters in threes and fours; pedicels\r\n    three-fourths of an inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube with a tinge of red, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    somewhat reddish, broad, acute, serrate, glabrous within and\r\n    without, reflexed; petals roundish, entire, nearly sessile, apex\r\n    entire; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, longer\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; nearly one inch in diameter, oblate,\r\n    strongly compressed; cavity deep, narrow, abrupt; suture shallow;\r\n    apex flattened or slightly depressed; color dark red; dots\r\n    numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous; stem one and three-fourths\r\n    inches long, adherent to the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating\r\n    from the pulp; flesh pale yellowish or with a tinge of red, with\r\n    light pink juice, slightly stringy, tender and melting, pleasantly\r\n    flavored, mildly tart; of very good quality; stone free,\r\n    roundish-oval, plump, blunt, oblique, with smooth surfaces often\r\n    tinged with red, with small ridges radiating from the base.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVET\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium × Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

The fruit, on the grounds of this Station,\r\nshows many characteristics of the Morellos while the tree appears to be\r\na Duke, suggesting that it is a hybrid between trees of the two groups.\r\nThe fruit, eaten out of hand, would be rated as a very good Morello or a\r\nsubacid and somewhat mediocre Duke, a fruit hardly good enough for\r\ndessert and not as good as some of the sourer cherries for culinary\r\npurposes. It is one of the earliest of the Morello-like cherries and\r\nthis may give it a place in the cherry flora of the country. The trees\r\nare large and vigorous and their much-branched, round tops would seem to\r\ngive the maximum amount of bearing surface, but, unfortunately, the\r\ncherries do not set abundantly. On the grounds of this Station the\r\nvariety is not fruitful, this being its chief defect. In other parts of\r\nthe country, however, it is reported to be either very productive or\r\nmoderately so. The descriptions of this cherry as given by American\r\nexperiment stations and nurserymen show plainly that there are several\r\ndistinct sorts passing under the name Olivet in this country.\r\n\r\nOlivet, of comparatively recent origin, was found at Olivet, Loire,\r\nFrance. American nurserymen introduced this variety sometime previous to\r\n1877, for in that year the _Gardener's Monthly_ mentioned the cherry as\r\nbeing \"a valuable Duke sort filling an unoccupied place among the list\r\nof early cherries in central New York.\" Olivet was entered on the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society's catalog list of fruits in 1881 where it\r\nis still retained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVET]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, round-topped,\r\n    unproductive; trunk thickish, rather rough; branches thick,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown partly overspread with ash-gray, with\r\n    numerous small lenticels; branchlets short, brown partly\r\n    overspread with ash-gray, smooth, with numerous raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and one-half inches long, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, folded upward, obovate to oval, thin;\r\n    upper surface dark green, smooth; lower surface light green,\r\n    glossy, with a few scattering hairs; apex acute; margin doubly\r\n    serrate, glandular; petiole one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    greenish, glandless or with one or two globose, brownish glands\r\n    variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Buds usually pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral buds\r\n    and in small clusters on short spurs; leaf-scars prominent; season\r\n    of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one inch across; borne in\r\n    dense clusters, usually in threes; pedicels one-half inch long,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube with a tinge of red, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes with a trace of red, long, of medium width,\r\n    acute, serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals\r\n    oval to slightly obovate, entire, nearly sessile; apex entire;\r\n    filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; nearly one inch in diameter, roundish\r\n    to slightly oblate, somewhat compressed; cavity abrupt, regular;\r\n    suture a line; apex roundish, with a small depression at the\r\n    center; color bright red; dots russet, obscure; stem thickish,\r\n    one and one-fourth inches long, adhering well to the fruit; skin\r\n    tough, separating from the pulp; flesh light red, with abundant\r\n    light red or wine-colored juice, tender and melting, sprightly,\r\n    astringent, tart; of fairly good quality; stone free, small,\r\n    roundish, slightly flattened, somewhat pointed at the apex, with\r\n    smooth surfaces; somewhat ridged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTHEIM\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Christ _Obstbäume_ 159. 1791. =2.= Christ _Handb._ 676. 1797.\r\n    =3.= Truchsess-Heim _Kirschensort_. 512-517. 1819. =4.= Prince\r\n    _Pom.

It is one of the Morellos and falls far short of the best of its\r\ngroup, the cherries being too small and of but mediocre quality. The\r\ntrees are typical Morellos, round-headed, with slender, drooping\r\nbranches and branchlets and very dark green foliage. The fruit is borne\r\ntoward the ends of short branches which are not well distributed over\r\nthe main branches, leaving much bare wood. Like all Morellos the fruit\r\nhangs long after maturity and since the ripening season is late the\r\nvariety may be worth growing because of its lateness; as it may, also,\r\nin cold climates because of great hardiness. The trees on their own\r\nroots throw up many suckers which are often used in propagation. The\r\nvariety has the reputation, too, of coming true to name from seeds.\r\n\r\nOstheim is a native of Spain and not of Germany as many have supposed.\r\nThe trees were found in the region of the Sierra Morena Mountains,\r\nSpain, and were taken to Germany by a Dr. Klinghammer after the Wars of\r\nthe Succession, 1701-1713. The cherry took the name Ostheim from the\r\nGerman town of that name where it was widely grown. The variety, being\r\neasily propagated, spread throughout Germany and soon became one of the\r\nbest-known cherries. Later, the name seems to have come to be a class\r\nterm for all cherries similar to the original Ostheim. The names\r\nOstheim, Ostheimer, Griotte Ostheim and Ostheimer Weichsel are used\r\ninterchangeably by foreign writers for this variety. American writers,\r\nhowever, have given these names to two very similar but distinct\r\nvarieties. Ostheim was brought to the United States by William Robert\r\nPrince of the Linnean Botanical Gardens early in the Nineteenth Century.\r\nIt has proved very satisfactory in some sections of the West and Canada,\r\nwhile in the East it is but a mediocre variety at best. At different\r\ntimes either buds or trees of so-called Ostheims have been imported to\r\nthis country which have turned out not to be the true variety. What\r\nthese sorts really are will remain uncertain until the several forms can\r\nbe brought together and compared. Professor Budd imported a variety in\r\n1883, which since has become known as Ostheim, carrying Griotte\r\nd'Ostheim as a synonym. Whether or not this is the old variety or a\r\ndistinct strain of the Ostheim class we are unable to say. The Cerise\r\nd'Ostheim received by this Station has proved identical with this\r\nvariety. Ostheim was first listed by the American Pomological Society in\r\n1899. A cherry known as Minnesota Ostheim, introduced into Minnesota\r\nfrom Germany, is now recognized as a distinct sort. The variety as it is\r\nknown in Kansas and Missouri is often called the German Ostheimer though\r\nsome believe this to be different from the true sort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSTHEIM]\r\n\r\n    Tree below medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading,\r\n    with drooping branchlets, dense, very productive; trunk\r\n    smooth; branches rather slender, smooth, dark ash-gray partly\r\n    overspreading reddish-brown, with small, raised lenticels;\r\n    branchlets slender, willowy, long, brown partly overspread with\r\n    ash-gray, smooth, glabrous, with small, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves very numerous, three and one-fourth inches long, one and\r\n    one-half inches wide, folded upward, obovate to oval; upper\r\n    surface very dark green, smooth; lower surface pale green, with a\r\n    few scattering hairs; apex taper-pointed, base variable in shape;\r\n    margin finely serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole slender,\r\n    one-half inch long, short, tinged with dull red, grooved, with\r\n    a few scattering hairs, with from one to three small, globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, usually obtuse, plump, free, arranged as\r\n    lateral buds and in small clusters on short spurs; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent; season of bloom medium; flowers one inch across,\r\n    white; borne in scattering clusters, in twos and threes; pedicels\r\n    five-eighths of an inch long, rather slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green with a faint tinge of red, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes with a trace of red, rather long, serrate, glabrous\r\n    within and without, reflexed; petals obovate, entire, nearly\r\n    sessile, apex entire; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, nearly equal in length to the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; nearly three-fourths of an inch in\r\n    diameter, roundish to slightly oblate, compressed; cavity very\r\n    shallow and narrow, flaring; suture indistinct; apex roundish with\r\n    a small depression at the center; color very dark red approaching\r\n    black; dots numerous, small, dark russet, inconspicuous; stem\r\n    slender, one and one-fourth inches long, but slightly adherent to\r\n    the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating readily from the pulp;\r\n    flesh dark red, with much very dark colored juice, tender and\r\n    melting, sprightly, tart, losing its astringency when fully ripe;\r\n    of fair quality; stone free, nearly one-half inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oblate, somewhat pointed, with smooth surfaces slightly\r\n    stained with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nOX HEART\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Miller _Gard.

In America the name is\r\nmost often given to the light-fleshed cherries, such as Yellow Spanish,\r\nNapoleon or White Bigarreau. At one time, however, the name was applied\r\nto a distinct variety known throughout England, Germany and America,\r\nbeing first mentioned by Miller, an Englishman, in 1734. Coxe, in 1817,\r\nwas the first American writer to list the variety but it never became\r\npopular in the New World. Ox Heart appeared among the fruits rejected by\r\nthe American Pomological Society in 1858 and from then on it gradually\r\ngave way to better varieties. The synonyms of the true Ox Heart are\r\nbadly confused not only with other dark-fleshed varieties but with those\r\nof the Yellow Spanish type. As some of these varieties are merely listed\r\nwhile others have but a meager description, it is impossible to separate\r\nor group them with any degree of certainty. In the 1909 catalog of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society there appears an Ox Heart of American\r\norigin and of recent introduction, known in the West as Major Francis.\r\nThere are also in several nursery catalogs a \"white-fleshed Ox Heart.\"\r\nWhat this variety is we are unable to say. The following is a\r\ndescription of Ox Heart compiled from European fruit books:\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in vigor, round-topped, spherical, productive;\r\n    branches somewhat curved; internodes of medium length; leaves\r\n    obovate, obtusely pointed, margin finely serrate; petiole short,\r\n    rather slender, flexible, tinged red, with two reniform glands;\r\n    flowers small; petals irregularly elliptical.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the last of June or early in July; medium to large,\r\n    cordate, pointed, sides unevenly compressed; color lively red\r\n    changing to intense purple or nearly black; stem of medium length\r\n    and thickness, usually tinged red, inserted in a broad, deep\r\n    cavity; skin tough; flesh dark red, with abundant colored juice,\r\n    half-tender but firmer than most Hearts, sweet though slightly\r\n    bitter before complete maturity; quality good; stone medium in\r\n    size, broadly cordate, adhering to the flesh along the ventral\r\n    suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nREINE HORTENSE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium X Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gen.

Several qualities fit it\r\nadmirably for home and somewhat for commercial plantations. To begin\r\nwith, it is most excellent in quality, its flavor being a commingling of\r\nthe refreshing acidity of the Sour Cherry and the richness of the Sweet\r\nCherry, though to some there may be a little too much acidity for a\r\nfirst-class dessert fruit. The cherries are also handsome--large, round,\r\nbright, glossy red with a shade of amber and very uniform in size, color\r\nand shape. The fruit is especially attractive on the tree as it hangs on\r\nlong stems in twos and threes thickly scattered and never much\r\nclustered. Unfortunately the fruit does not stand handling in harvesting\r\nand marketing quite as well as that of some other Dukes and is a little\r\ntoo susceptible to brown-rot for a good commercial cherry. The chief\r\nfaults of the variety, however, are in the trees rather than in the\r\nfruit. The trees are but of medium size, are not as productive as some\r\nothers of the hybrid sorts, are at their best only in choice cherry\r\nsoils and demand good care. In Europe, Reine Hortense is much used as a\r\ndwarf and for training on walls. It would seem that its merits and\r\nfaults, as it grows in America, are such as fit it preeminently well\r\nonly for the amateur.\r\n\r\nOf the several accounts of the origin of Reine Hortense the one giving\r\nFrance as its home and Larose as its originator is here accepted as\r\nauthentic. M. Larose of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Seine, a gardener of the\r\nimperial court, grew the original tree early in the Nineteenth Century\r\nfrom a seed of the Cerise Larose, a seedling of his introduction. Soon\r\nafter the first mention of this variety, about 1841, there appeared the\r\nLouis XVIII, Morestin, Guigne de Petit-Brie and several others. The\r\nvariety was seemingly rechristened by every nurseryman who got hold of\r\nit. At one time the name Monstreuse de Bavay was acceptable to many, it\r\nhaving been given to the variety by a Mr. Bavay of Vilvorde, Brabant,\r\nBelgium, about 1826. The theory that Reine Hortense comes true to seed\r\nand therefore has several strains has been discredited. The American\r\nPomological Society recognized Reine Hortense in 1856, only a few years\r\nafter being introduced into this country, by placing it on the\r\nrecommended fruit list. In 1909, the Society shortened the name from\r\nReine Hortense to Hortense but in this text we prefer to use the full\r\nname, thereby indicating clearly the person for whom the cherry was\r\nchristened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REINE HORTENSE]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright-spreading, productive; trunk shaggy;\r\n    branches smooth, dark reddish-brown covered with ash-gray, with\r\n    a few large lenticels; branchlets rather slender, with short\r\n    internodes, brown partly overspread with ash-gray, smooth, with\r\n    inconspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, four and one-half inches long, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval to obovate, thin; upper surface\r\n    dark green, rugose; lower surface light green, pubescent along\r\n    the midrib; apex taper-pointed, base abrupt; margin coarsely\r\n    serrate, with dark glands; petiole one inch long, tinged with red,\r\n    pubescent along the grooved upper surface, with none or with from\r\n    one to four small, globose, greenish-yellow or brownish glands,\r\n    usually at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long-pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\n    buds and in small clusters on few long spurs; blooms appearing\r\n    in mid-season; flowers white, one and one-fourth inches across;\r\n    borne in dense clusters usually in threes; pedicels one inch long,\r\n    slender, glabrous; calyx-tube with a tinge of red, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes long, acuminate, glabrous within and\r\n    without, reflexed; petals roundish, entire, sessile, with entire\r\n    apex; filaments one-fourth of an inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; nearly one inch in diameter,\r\n    oblong-conic to obtuse-conic, compressed; cavity somewhat shallow,\r\n    narrow, abrupt, often lipped; suture indistinct; apex roundish\r\n    with a small depression at the center; color amber-red; dots\r\n    numerous, light russet, conspicuous; stem tortuous, slender, one\r\n    and one-half inches long, adherent to the fruit; skin tender,\r\n    separating from the pulp; flesh pale yellow, with colorless juice,\r\n    tender and melting, sprightly subacid; of very good quality; stone\r\n    free, rather large, oblong to oval, flattened, blunt, with smooth\r\n    surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Judged\r\nby the palate, Republican is one of the best of the Bigarreaus. The\r\ncherries are rich and sweet in flavor, firm of flesh and with an\r\nabundance of refreshing juice. Judged by the eye, too, it holds its own\r\nwith the best of its class, the fruit having a pleasing rotundness of\r\nshape and a beautiful dark red, almost black, glossy color. In size the\r\nvariety very often falls short; for, though often given as one of the\r\nlargest, it turns out to be, in many orchards, but of medium size and\r\nsometimes is small. Here seems to be its fatal defect. It is exceedingly\r\ncapricious as to soils, failing wholly or in part in all but the very\r\nchoicest cherry environments. The trees are large, spreading and\r\nvigorous but on the grounds of this Station are more susceptible to the\r\nshot-hole fungus than any other Sweet Cherry. It has been reported to be\r\nvery subject to this disease at the Washington Station also. The failure\r\nof this cherry to meet the demands of commercial cherry-growers during a\r\nprobationary period of nearly a half a century means that it is, at\r\nmost, of but local value.\r\n\r\nThis variety, known under two other names, Black Republican and\r\nLewelling, originated about the middle of the Nineteenth Century in the\r\norchard of Seth Lewelling, Milwaukee, Oregon. In traveling across the\r\ncontinent in 1849, Mr. Lewelling took with him to Oregon, Bigarreau,\r\nMorello and Mahaleb cherries and from seeds of one of the Bigarreaus\r\nsprang several seedlings, among them one which was named Black\r\nRepublican. The parentage of the sort is not known though it was thought\r\nto be a cross between Napoleon and Black Tartarian, having sprung up\r\nnear these two trees. Some cherry-growers and nurserymen describe a\r\ncherry which they call Lewelling but in every case the descriptions\r\nagree very closely with Republican. Many list the two names separately\r\nas designating two distinct varieties of diverse origin. Of these, some\r\nhave supposed Republican to be a seedling of Eagle originating in 1860.\r\nThe American Pomological Society for many years listed Black Republican\r\nalone beginning in its catalog of 1875 but in 1909 the catalog contained\r\nthe two names, Republican and Lewelling. Inasmuch as the consensus of\r\nopinion is that both names apply to a single cherry this Station has\r\ndecided to list Republican only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPUBLICAN]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, very\r\n    productive; trunk thick, somewhat shaggy; branches stout,\r\n    roughened, brown covered with ash-gray, with large, raised\r\n    lenticels; branchlets stout, with long internodes, brown nearly\r\n    overspread with ash-gray, smooth except near the base, with a few\r\n    small, raised, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, five inches long, two and five-eighths inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, obovate to oval, thin; upper surface dark\r\n    green, smooth; lower surface slightly hairy; apex acute, base\r\n    abrupt; margin coarsely and doubly serrate, glandular; petiole one\r\n    and one-fourth inches long, thick, tinged with dull red, with two\r\n    or three large, reniform, light green or reddish glands on the\r\n    stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds pointed or obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly on the\r\n    branchlets, or in small clusters on spurs of medium length;\r\n    season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one and one-half\r\n    inches across; borne in scattering clusters in ones and\r\n    twos; pedicels variable in length, averaging one inch long,\r\n    characteristically thick, glabrous; calyx-tube tinged with red,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes variable in width, tinged\r\n    with red, long-obovate to acute, finely serrate, glabrous within\r\n    and without, reflexed; petals obovate, entire, with short, blunt\r\n    claws, with shallow, notched apex; filaments five-sixteenths of an\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length, often\r\n    defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; about one inch in diameter, wide, variable\r\n    in shape, cordate or roundish-cordate, compressed, with angular\r\n    and uneven surfaces; cavity deep, wide, flaring; suture a shallow\r\n    groove, often extending around the fruit; apex with a small\r\n    depression at the center; color purplish-black; dots numerous,\r\n    small, dark russet, inconspicuous; stem thick, one and one-eighth\r\n    inches long, adherent to the fruit; skin thin; flesh purplish-red,\r\n    with dark colored juice, tender, meaty, crisp, mild, sweet or with\r\n    slight astringency before fully mature; of good quality; stone\r\n    semi-free, small, ovate, flattened, rather blunt, with smooth\r\n    surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCKPORT\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Horticulturist_ =2=:59 fig., 60. 1847-48. =2.= Elliott _Fr.\r\n    Book_ 201, 202 fig. 1854. =3.= Hooper _W.

It is more\r\neasily characterized by its faults than its merits. Compared with the\r\nwell-known Yellow Spanish, of which it is a seedling and to which it is\r\nsimilar, the cherries are smaller and the pits are larger than those of\r\nthe parent variety,--quite too large for the amount of pulp. Worst of\r\nthe faults of the variety is, however, that the cherries are not\r\nsufficiently firm of flesh to withstand harvesting, shipping and the\r\nattacks of the brown-rot fungus. To offset the defects of the fruit the\r\nflesh is rich, sweet and tender, making it, all in all, as good as any\r\nother Sweet Cherry for dessert. The trees, too, are very satisfactory,\r\nbeing large, vigorous and very fruitful, though with the reputation of\r\nrequiring good soil and the best of care, of lacking a little in\r\nhardiness to cold, and of having the period of maturing the crop more or\r\nless changed by soil and culture. Rockport has been, and is, more or\r\nless popular in New York but it can be recommended only for a home\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nRockport is another of Professor Kirtland's introductions, having been\r\nraised by him at Cleveland, Ohio, about 1842, from a seed of Yellow\r\nSpanish. It soon won a place, in 1862, on the fruit list of the American\r\nPomological Society where it still remains. It is mentioned by several\r\nforeign authors and many American nurserymen offer it for sale. Swedish\r\nis given as a synonym of Rockport by Hooper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCKPORT]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright, very productive; trunk somewhat\r\n    slender, roughish; branches smooth, reddish-brown, with numerous\r\n    small lenticels; branchlets stout, variable in length, with long\r\n    internodes, brown almost entirely overspread with ash-gray,\r\n    smooth, with conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three and one-half inches long, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, folded upward, long-oval to obovate;\r\n    upper surface dark green, somewhat rugose; lower surface\r\n    dull, light green, pubescent along the veins; apex acute to\r\n    taper-pointed, base abrupt; margin coarsely serrate, glandular;\r\n    petiole two inches long, tinged with red, with a few hairs on the\r\n    upper surface, glandless or with from one to four large, reniform,\r\n    reddish glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly and in\r\n    clusters from lateral buds and short spurs; leaf-scars prominent;\r\n    season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches across; borne in clusters usually in twos; pedicels one\r\n    inch long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes acute, glabrous within and without,\r\n    reflexed; petals roundish, entire, dentate at the apex, nearly\r\n    sessile; filaments nearly one-half inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    shorter than the stamens, often defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; one inch in diameter, cordate to conical,\r\n    compressed; cavity shallow, wide, flaring, regular; suture a\r\n    distinct line; apex roundish, with a small depression at the\r\n    center; color bright red over an amber-yellow background, mottled;\r\n    dots very numerous, small, light yellowish, somewhat conspicuous;\r\n    stem one and one-half inches long, adhering well to the fruit;\r\n    skin thin, tender; flesh pale yellowish-white, with colorless\r\n    juice, tender, somewhat melting, aromatic, mild, sweet; good\r\n    to very good in quality; stone free, ovate, plump, with smooth\r\n    surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL DUKE\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_ × _Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mag.

It\r\nis so nearly like these two sorts, except in season, and so similar to\r\nArch Duke, as well, that there is much difficulty in getting the variety\r\ntrue to name. It is more often taken for May Duke than for the other\r\nkinds named but it differs from this well-known sort in being a little\r\nlater in season, and the cherries are larger, a little lighter in color,\r\ndo not hang as thickly, being scattered along the branches, often\r\nsingly, and are more oblate. The trees are markedly upright and the\r\nfoliage is very dense. None of the Dukes are popular in America for\r\nmarket fruits and this is no exception though, among all, Royal Duke is\r\nas good as any--pleasantly flavored, juicy, refreshing and very good.\r\nThe trees, too, are very satisfactory. The variety has a place in home\r\norchards and for local markets. The French say that the tree makes a\r\nvery weak growth budded on the Mahaleb and that it should be worked on\r\nthe Mazzard, which is generally true of all Dukes. The buyer will have\r\ndifficulty in getting the true Royal Duke in America.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this variety is unknown but the Royale d'Angleterre,\r\nmentioned by Christ in 1791, was probably the variety now known as Royal\r\nDuke, although the description is too meager to be certain. According to\r\nThompson, Royal Duke was one of the varieties formerly cultivated in\r\nEngland under the names Late Duke, Arch Duke, or Late Arch Duke and was\r\nprobably introduced by the London Horticultural Society from France\r\nunder the name of Anglaise Tardive. When or by whom this variety was\r\nintroduced into America is not known but according to Downing it was\r\nvery rarely found here in the first half of the Nineteenth Century.\r\nThe American Pomological Society placed Royal Duke upon its catalog list\r\nof recommended fruits in 1871.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL DUKE]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright, vasiform, unproductive\r\n    at this Station; trunk slender, roughish; branches stocky, with\r\n    roughened surface, dark reddish-brown covered with ash-gray, with\r\n    lenticels of medium number and size; branchlets stout, long, brown\r\n    partly overspread with ash-gray, smooth except for the lenticels\r\n    which are inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, variable in size, averaging four and one-half\r\n    inches long, two inches wide, folded upward, oval to obovate;\r\n    upper surface dark green, slightly rugose; lower surface medium\r\n    green, pubescent along the midrib; apex abruptly pointed, base\r\n    acute; margin serrate or crenate; petiole variable in length,\r\n    often one and one-half inches long, not uniform in thickness,\r\n    tinged with red, glandless or with one or two small, reniform,\r\n    greenish-yellow or reddish glands, usually at the base of the\r\n    blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds rather small, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds and in very dense clusters on numerous short spurs;\r\n    leaf-scars obscure; time of bloom mid-season; flowers white,\r\n    one inch across; borne in very dense clusters, closely grouped\r\n    in fours and fives; pedicels over one-half inch long, glabrous,\r\n    green; calyx-tube green or with a tinge of red, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes with a trace of red, acute, serrate, glabrous within\r\n    and without, reflexed; petals roundish, entire, sessile, apex\r\n    entire; filaments nearly one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; three-fourths inch in diameter, oblate,\r\n    compressed; cavity rather narrow, abrupt, regular; suture a mere\r\n    line; apex flattened or depressed; color bright red becoming\r\n    darker at maturity; dots few, small, obscure; stem one and\r\n    one-half inches long, adhering to the fruit; skin thin, rather\r\n    tough, separating from the pulp; flesh pale yellowish-white with\r\n    tinge of red, pinkish juice, tender, sprightly, pleasantly acid;\r\n    good to very good in quality; stone semi-free, small, ovate,\r\n    slightly flattened, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHMIDT\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Dochnahl _Führ.

Yet in New York, at least, it is not\r\nreceiving the attention that it deserves from commercial cherry-growers,\r\nbeing relegated to the rear of ten or a dozen kinds when it should be in\r\nthe front rank. Indeed, about Geneva, where many Sweet Cherries are\r\ngrown, while not the leading market variety, it is one of the best. The\r\ncharacters which entitle it to a high place as a money-maker are: large\r\nsize, being unsurpassed in this respect by any other black cherry in\r\nthis region; its round, plump form and glossy, black color which tempt\r\nthe eye; crisp, firm, juicy flesh and sweet, rich flavor, delicious to\r\nthe taste; dark ruby-red color under the skin which makes it as pleasing\r\ninwardly as outwardly; freedom from brown-rot, in this respect excelling\r\nany other market sort; and a vigorous, healthy, productive tree. The\r\ntree is further characterized by its abundant, large leaves of dark,\r\nluxuriant green. The fruit is often picked before it is ripe, at which\r\ntime it is dark red and not black. There is a good deal of enthusiasm in\r\nNew York over several new Sweet Cherries from the Pacific Coast but in\r\nthis vicinity none of these is equal to Schmidt.\r\n\r\nSchmidt is a seedling of Festfleischige Schwarze Knorpelkirsche and was\r\nraised by Herr Schmidt, Forester at Casekow, Prussia, Germany, about\r\n1841. It was introduced into England by Thomas Rivers of Sawbridgeworth\r\nand eventually found its way to America but how and when is not known.\r\nSchmidt appeared on the fruit list of the American Pomological Society\r\nin 1897 but only for two years when for some reason it was dropped. In\r\n1909, a Smith was listed, with Smith's Bigarreau as a synonym.\r\nBudd-Hansen in the publication of 1903 also mentioned a Smith which is\r\nprobably Schmidt. We are inclined to hold to the German spelling,\r\nSchmidt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHMIDT]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, productive;\r\n    trunk and branches stocky, smooth; branches dull reddish-brown\r\n    covered with ash-gray, with numerous lenticels; branchlets thick,\r\n    short, smooth, with rather conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, six inches long, three inches wide, folded\r\n    upward, obovate; upper surface light green, smooth; lower surface\r\n    pale green, pubescent along the midrib and larger veins; apex\r\n    acute, base abrupt; margin serrate, glandular; petiole one and\r\n    one-half inches long, thick, dull red, with a narrow, deep groove\r\n    along the upper surface, glandless or with one or two large,\r\n    reniform, reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long, obtuse to conical, plump, free, arranged singly\r\n    as lateral buds and in numerous small clusters; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent; time of blooming mid-season; flowers white, one and\r\n    one-half inches across; borne in scattering clusters in twos and\r\n    threes; pedicels one inch long, thick, glabrous; calyx-tube green\r\n    or with a tinge of red, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes long,\r\n    broad, acute, serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed;\r\n    petals oval, crenate, with short, narrow claws; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; one inch in diameter, cordate,\r\n    compressed, often slightly oblique; cavity deep, wide, flaring;\r\n    suture indistinct; apex bluntly pointed; color purplish-black;\r\n    dots numerous, small, dark russet, obscure; stem slender, one\r\n    and one-half inches long, strongly adherent to the fruit; skin\r\n    tough, separating from the pulp; flesh purplish-red, with dark\r\n    colored juice, very meaty, crisp, firm, mild, sweet; of good\r\n    quality; stone semi-clinging, ovate, slightly oblique, with smooth\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT-STEM MONTMORENCY\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Christ. _Handb._ 679. 1797. =2.= _Prince Pom.

Of these closely related strains, all of which\r\nprobably originated about the same time in Montmorency Valley, France,\r\nMontmorency is by far the most important and the one now grown\r\ncommercially in all parts of the country. Large Montmorency, while quite\r\nsimilar to Montmorency, is much less grown because of its\r\nunproductiveness, although in quality it is quite equal or perhaps\r\nsuperior to Montmorency. Short-Stem Montmorency, under discussion here,\r\nvaries considerably both in tree and fruit from either of the other two,\r\nalthough it is frequently taken for Large Montmorency. The tree is\r\nsmaller and more drooping but usually very productive. The fruit,\r\nsimilar in size to Large Montmorency, differs from it by being more\r\noblate and irregular, and in having a very deep, wide suture which\r\nbecomes an indistinct line towards the apex. The skin seldom becomes as\r\ndark red even at perfect maturity. The flavor is more sprightly but its\r\nquality is not as high. All three varieties have long lists of synonyms,\r\nmany of which have been used for each of the three sorts. Many writers\r\nbelieve that only two distinct strains of Montmorency exist and that\r\nShort-Stem Montmorency is identical with Large Montmorency. The variety\r\nis little grown in North America and is not as worthy for any purpose as\r\neither of the other two better-known sorts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHORT-STEM MONTMORENCY]\r\n\r\n    Tree upright-spreading, round-topped, productive; trunk shaggy;\r\n    branches roughish, reddish-brown covered with ash-gray, with\r\n    numerous lenticels; branchlets slender, long, brown partly\r\n    overspread with ash-gray, smooth, with conspicuous, numerous,\r\n    small, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, variable in size, averaging four inches long,\r\n    one and three-fourths inches wide, long-oval to obovate, thick;\r\n    upper surface dark green, smooth; lower surface medium green, with\r\n    a prominent midrib; apex taper-pointed, base acute; margin doubly\r\n    crenate, glandular; petiole one inch long, tinged with dull red,\r\n    variable in thickness, lightly pubescent, glandless or with from\r\n    one to three large, raised, reniform glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, variable in shape, free, arranged as lateral\r\n    buds and on few, if any, spurs; leaf-scars obscure; season of\r\n    bloom late; flowers white, one inch across; borne in a few\r\n    scattering clusters, variable in number of flowers per cluster;\r\n    pedicels one-half inch long, thick, greenish; calyx-tube green\r\n    or with a tinge of red, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes with\r\n    a trace of red, obtuse, serrate, glabrous within and without,\r\n    reflexed; petals roundish-oval, crenate, sessile, with a\r\n    distinctly notched apex; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, equal to the stamens in length, often defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; over three-fourths of an inch in\r\n    diameter, decidedly oblate, irregular in outline, slightly\r\n    compressed; cavity deep, wide, irregular, flaring; suture very\r\n    deep near the stem but shallow at the apex which is flattened or\r\n    depressed; color light to dark red; dots numerous, small, russet,\r\n    inconspicuous; stem very thick, less than three-fourths of an\r\n    inch long, adhering strongly to the fruit; skin rather tender,\r\n    separating from the pulp; flesh pale yellow, with colorless juice,\r\n    tender and melting, sprightly, sour; of fair quality; stone\r\n    clinging along the ventral suture, small, roundish, plump, blunt,\r\n    with smooth surfaces, faintly tinged with red; ventral suture very\r\n    prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKLANKA\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

The cherries of Sklanka have the\r\nlight-colored skin and juice of the Amarelles while the dwarfish,\r\nround-topped trees with pendant branches and abundant, small leaves are\r\ntypical of the Morellos. The variety is in no way remarkable unless it\r\nbe in hardiness, the pomologists of the colder parts of the Mississippi\r\nValley holding that it is one of the hardiest of cherries. The fruit is\r\nnot on a par with that of a score of other Amarelles and the trees, in\r\nNew York at least, are too small and unproductive to be worth planting.\r\nThe cherry has value, then, only where hardiness is a prime requisite.\r\n\r\nSklanka was imported to this country from Russia in 1883 by Professor J.\r\nL. Budd of Ames, Iowa. Its parentage and origin are uncertain. It does\r\nnot seem to have been grown in continental Europe outside of Russia but\r\nin certain sections of that country it is reported as being one of the\r\nhardiest and most productive of the Sour Cherries. As grown in our\r\nNorthern Central States it has proved one of the hardiest of all\r\nvarieties but has not, as yet, gained much reputation commercially even\r\nin these cold regions.

The name \"honey\" which appears in\r\nseveral of the synonyms is indicative of the flavor of the fruit. The\r\ncherries are quite too small and the pits altogether too large for a\r\ncommercial product. The tree is upright-spreading, with numerous thick\r\nbranches over which the cherries are rather thickly scattered in ones,\r\ntwos and threes and never in clusters. The fruit-stems are\r\ncharacteristically long and slender. Though of the Bigarreau group the\r\nflesh is too tender to well withstand harvesting, shipping and the\r\nbrown-rot.\r\n\r\nThis cherry was introduced by Edward Sparhawk, for whom it was named, of\r\nBrighton, Massachusetts. The variety has been known under a number of\r\ndifferent names, the number being no measure of its merit, however, for\r\nit has never been extensively cultivated. The American Pomological\r\nSociety placed it in its fruit catalog list of recommended varieties in\r\n1862 but dropped it in 1871 and for many years but little attention has\r\nbeen given it.

Several\r\nreferences from the Middle West mention Späte Amarelle as very promising\r\nbut in New York, where such sorts as Early Richmond and the\r\nMontmorencies thrive, it is unpromising for any purpose. The cherries\r\nare quite too poor in quality, being very sour, and the trees too\r\nunproductive to make the variety even a poor rival of a score or more of\r\nAmarelles and Dukes with which it would have to compete in this State.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this cherry is unknown but according to Truchsess it was\r\nsent out from Hanover as Späte Morelle in 1785. In 1797, Christ mentions\r\na cherry under this name the description of which agrees with that of\r\nSpäte Amarelle. Lauche states that Truchsess received the variety from\r\nHanover under the name Späte Morelle and later changed the name to Späte\r\nAmarelle. This cherry was grown in the Paris National Nursery under the\r\nname Cerise Amarelle Tardive and at one time was commonly grown in\r\ngardens in France. In the spring of 1883, Professor J. L. Budd of Iowa\r\nbrought to America a large number of cherries from central and eastern\r\nEurope. Somehow there was confusion in the description of these imported\r\ncherries and two kinds were described under the name Späte Amarelle, one\r\na light-fleshed sort, the other with red flesh and colored juice. The\r\ntrue variety has light flesh and juice and a pleasant, acid flavor and\r\nis probably identical with the old French sort, Cerise Amarelle Tardive.\r\nThe cherry sometimes called Späte Morello can be no other than the Späte\r\nAmarelle.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright-spreading, round-topped,\r\n    rather unproductive; trunk stocky, somewhat shaggy; branches\r\n    smooth, dark brown overspread by ash-gray, with numerous lenticels\r\n    variable in size; branchlets slender, rather short, brown nearly\r\n    covered with ash-gray, smooth, with slightly raised, inconspicuous\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, small, folded upward, oval to somewhat obovate,\r\n    rather stiff; upper surface dark green, smooth; lower surface\r\n    medium green, pubescent only on the midrib and larger veins; apex\r\n    acute, base variable in shape; margin finely serrate, glandular;\r\n    petiole greenish or with a slight bronze tinge, glandless or with\r\n    from one to four small, globose, brown or yellowish glands usually\r\n    at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral buds\r\n    and in clusters on long or short spurs; leaf-scars prominent;\r\n    season of bloom late; flowers one inch across, white; borne in\r\n    scattered clusters, usually in threes; pedicels three-fourths of\r\n    an inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green with\r\n    a tinge of red, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes with a trace of\r\n    red, rather narrow, acute, serrate, glabrous within and without,\r\n    reflexed; petals broad-oval, entire, slightly crenate at the apex;\r\n    filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to or\r\n    longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; one-half inch long, oblate, slightly\r\n    compressed; cavity shallow, narrow; suture indistinct; apex\r\n    roundish or depressed; color dark red; dots numerous, very small,\r\n    obscure; stem slender, one and one-half inches long; skin thin,\r\n    tender; flesh light red, with light colored juice, tender, tart;\r\n    of good quality; stone free, roundish, flattened, with smooth\r\n    surfaces; distinctly ridged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUDA\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

The trees of Suda in general aspect are more upright and\r\nthe stems of the cherries longer and more slender than those of English\r\nMorello, being but an inch in length in the one variety and an inch and\r\nthree-fourths in the other. The trees on the grounds of this Station are\r\nnot as productive as those of English Morello. The cherries, if\r\nanything, are not as high in quality as those of the older and probably\r\nthe parent variety. It is doubtful if there is a place for Suda in the\r\ncherry industry of New York.\r\n\r\nThis cherry originated in the garden of a Captain Suda, Louisiana,\r\nMissouri, about 1880. The American Pomological Society listed Suda in\r\nits fruit catalog of 1899 as Suda Hardy but in 1909 shortened the name\r\nto Suda, a change which has generally been accepted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUDA]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, rather unproductive; branches slender, with\r\n    numerous small lenticels; branchlets slender, long; leaves\r\n    numerous, four inches long, two and one-fourth inches wide,\r\n    obovate to oval, dull, dark green; margin doubly serrate,\r\n    with dark glands; petiole one inch long, of medium thickness,\r\n    tinged with dull red, glandless or with one or two reniform,\r\n    yellowish-brown glands usually at the base of the blade; buds\r\n    small, short, obtuse, arranged singly as lateral buds and on but\r\n    very few, if any, spurs; season of bloom late; flowers white, one\r\n    inch across; filaments one-fourth inch long; pistil shorter than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; three-fourths inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-cordate, slightly compressed; cavity flaring; suture\r\n    indistinct; color dark purplish-red; stem slender, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches long, adherent to the fruit; skin separating\r\n    from the pulp; flesh dark red, with dark colored juice, tender,\r\n    somewhat meaty, sprightly, astringent, very sour; poor in quality;\r\n    stone free or nearly so, ovate, slightly pointed, with smooth\r\n    surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMME\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

On the\r\ngrounds of this Station the trees of Timme are even more productive\r\nthan those of Early Richmond, one of the most fruitful of all cherries,\r\nbut the greater fruitfulness of the tree hardly offsets the smaller size\r\nof the cherries. It is doubtful if this new strain can displace the\r\nolder Early Richmond, which is well established in the favor of\r\ncherry-growers everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis variety is supposed to have been brought to America from Germany by\r\na Mr. Timme of Omaha, Nebraska. It is of some local importance in Iowa\r\nand Nebraska but as yet has not been widely distributed in America.\r\nPossibly it will be found in time that it is some old German variety\r\nrenamed. It was placed on the fruit list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIMME]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, rather vigorous, upright-spreading,\r\n    open-topped, healthy; trunk and branches thick, with numerous\r\n    large lenticels; branchlets slender, long, willowy; leaves three\r\n    and one-half inches long, one and five-eighths inches wide, ovate\r\n    to obovate, thick, stiff, leathery, dark green; margin finely\r\n    serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-fourths\r\n    of an inch in length, with one or two large, globose glands\r\n    variable in position; flowers one inch across, in dense clusters.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures medium early; over one-half inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oblate; color light red becoming dark red at full\r\n    maturity; stem one inch long; flesh yellowish-white, with abundant\r\n    pinkish juice, tender and melting, pleasant flavored, sprightly;\r\n    good in quality; stone semi-clinging, roundish-ovate, plump;\r\n    prominently ridged along the ventral suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUSSAINT\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Duhamel Trait.

Instead of bearing\r\nblossoms normally this variety sends out small branches from the buds.\r\nIn the axis of the first four leaves are borne the buds destined to\r\nproduce similar branches the following spring. As the branches elongate\r\nthese buds remain dormant but others are borne which produce flowers in\r\numbel-like clusters of two or three. The trees begin blooming three or\r\nfour weeks later than other cherries and new buds and flowers appear\r\ncontinually until August or thereabouts. The tree, too, is most striking\r\nin appearance, being dwarfish in stature, thickly set with pendant\r\nbranchlets and, all in all, attractive enough to make it a rather\r\nhandsome ornamental. The cherries are of little or no value, being quite\r\ntoo acid to eat out of hand but furnishing very late fruit which may be\r\nused for culinary purposes. The description given is compiled.\r\n\r\nThe history of the variety is uncertain. Leroy says that it was\r\nmentioned by Daléchamp, a French writer, as early as 1586. Duhamel seems\r\nto have been the first pomologist to describe it which he did in 1768\r\nunder the name Cerisier de la Toussaint. The variety is well known in\r\nEurope, being widely distributed in Austria, Germany, Belgium, France\r\nand England, pomologists and nurserymen in all these countries seeming\r\nto be well acquainted with it. There are no records of its culture in\r\nAmerica, although Prince and Elliott describe it from European fruit\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, hardy, moderately productive; branches slender,\r\n    numerous, pendant.\r\n\r\n    Fruit small, flattened on the ends and sides; stem long; color\r\n    clear red, darker on maturing, rather transparent; flesh white\r\n    somewhat red at the center, with reddish juice; flavor, if mature,\r\n    sour, though not excellent; stone large, long, clings to the flesh\r\n    more than to the stem. The fruit borne in October never reaches\r\n    maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVLADIMIR\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia. Hort. Soc. Rpt._ 84, 85. 1882. =2.= _Am. Pom. Soc.

The cherries are large, very similar in\r\nsize and appearance to those of English Morello; the pit is small, the\r\nskin very thin and separating readily from the pulp. The variety is\r\nfurther characterized by the very dark red flesh and dark colored juice\r\nwhich is too astringent and sour to eat out of hand but does very well\r\nfor culinary purposes. The tree is much like that of English Morello but\r\nis far more dwarfish and not as productive, these being fatal faults for\r\ncommercial planting in New York. It falls short of English Morello in\r\nanother respect--the fruit ripens very unevenly. Vladimir has the\r\nreputation of being one of the hardiest of all cherries. It is said to\r\ncome true from seed and does better on its own roots than on either\r\nMazzard or Mahaleb. The Russians, according to Budd, succeed best with\r\nit when it is propagated from sprouts and allowed to form a bushy plant\r\nwith several stems, the oldest of which are cut from time to time.\r\nThere seems to be little in the variety to commend it for either home or\r\ncommercial plantings in New York.\r\n\r\nVladimir is a generic name for a group of varieties grown in Russia,\r\nprincipally in the province of Vladimir east of Moscow. Most of these\r\ncherries are large, black fruits with highly colored juice and good\r\nquality, much valued for market use in their native country. Professor\r\nJ. L. Budd imported a number of these Vladimir cherries from Orel in\r\nCentral Russia and grew them at the Experiment Station grounds in Iowa,\r\ngiving to each a seedling number as a distinguishing characteristic.\r\nOne, Orel No. 25, was selected as being superior in many respects to the\r\nothers and was finally named Vladimir. This variety, typical of these\r\nRussian cherries, has been considerably propagated and is generally\r\ndistributed throughout this country. The American Pomological Society\r\nadded Vladimir to its list of recommended fruits in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VLADIMIR]\r\n\r\n    Tree dwarfish, round-topped, very hardy, productive; trunk medium\r\n    or below in size; branches willowy, drooping, reddish-brown\r\n    slightly overspread with ash-gray; branchlets slender, long,\r\n    smooth, with a few small, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, three inches long, one and three-fourths inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, oval, thick; upper surface dull, dark green,\r\n    smooth; lower surface light green, with a few scattering hairs;\r\n    apex acute, base slightly abrupt; margin finely serrate, with dark\r\n    colored glands; petiole one-half inch long, tinged with red, with\r\n    a few scattering hairs along the stalk, glandless or with from one\r\n    to four small, reniform, greenish-yellow glands at the base of the\r\n    blade.\r\n\r\n    Buds small, short, very obtuse, plump, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds and in small clusters on small spurs; leaf-scars\r\n    obscure; season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches across; borne in scattering clusters in twos,\r\n    threes and fours; pedicels three-fourths of an inch long, rather\r\n    slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube with a tinge of red,\r\n    somewhat obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes reddish, broad, obtuse,\r\n    serrate, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals roundish or\r\n    slightly obovate, irregularly crenate, with short, blunt claws,\r\n    apex entire; filaments over one-fourth inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; three-eighths of an inch long,\r\n    seven-eighths of an inch wide, roundish-cordate, slightly\r\n    compressed; cavity rather shallow; suture a line; apex roundish;\r\n    color dark red almost black at full maturity; dots numerous,\r\n    small, russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, one and one-half\r\n    inches or more in length, adherent to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    separating from the pulp; flesh dark red, with very dark colored\r\n    juice, slightly stringy, melting, sprightly, astringent, sour; of\r\n    fair quality; stone semi-clinging, rather large, long-ovate to\r\n    oval, with smooth surfaces, tinged with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERLOO\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium × (Prunus avium × Prunus cerasus)_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

It is an interesting cherry resembling the Bigarreaus in tree\r\nand leaf-characters while the flowers are more like those of the Dukes,\r\nthe fruit, too, taking on more the aspect of the Dukes than of the Sweet\r\nCherry. The variety has long since passed from general cultivation in\r\nthe United States and can now be found only in collections or as an\r\noccasional dooryard tree.\r\n\r\nThis cherry was raised early in the Nineteenth Century by T. A. Knight,\r\nDownton Castle, Wiltshire, England, and first fruited in 1815, shortly\r\nafter the Battle of Waterloo, hence its name. It was supposed to be a\r\ncross between Yellow Spanish and May Duke. The variety was brought to\r\nthis country by Honorable John Lowell of Newton, Massachusetts, though\r\nit was described by Prince in 1828 from European fruit books. The\r\nfollowing description is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, thrifty, rather irregular and spreading,\r\n    productive; branchlets thick, stocky, grayish; leaves large,\r\n    drooping, wavy; margin slightly serrate; flowers large; stamens\r\n    shorter than the pistil.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the last of June or early in July; large,\r\n    obtuse-cordate, broad at the base, convex on one side, flattened\r\n    on the other; stem one and one-half to two inches in length,\r\n    slender; color dark purplish-red becoming nearly black at\r\n    maturity; skin thin; flesh purplish-red becoming darker next\r\n    to the stone, firm but tender, juicy, fine flavored, sweet;\r\n    good in quality; stone separating readily from the pulp, small,\r\n    roundish-ovate, compressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE BIGARREAU\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Thacher _Am.

Rivers, the English pomologist,\r\nbelieved it to have come originally from Russia. It is reputed to have\r\nbeen brought to America from France by Chancellor Livingston of\r\nRevolutionary fame. Thacher, in 1822, described the variety first under\r\nits present name. The variety, as the synonymy shows, has been grown\r\nunder many names both in America and Europe. In 1845, according to\r\nDowning, this cherry was common in the neighborhood of New York and\r\nPhiladelphia but since Downing's time no one seems to have mentioned it.\r\nThe variety is usually spoken of in the United States as neither hardy\r\nnor productive. The fruit books describe it as follows:\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, spreading, very tender, unproductive; leaves\r\n    narrow, waved.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures the last of June or early in July; large to very\r\n    large, heart-shaped, somewhat pointed; color yellowish-white with\r\n    a bright red cheek, mottled; flesh very firm, breaking, pleasantly\r\n    flavored, sweet; very good in quality; stone separating readily\r\n    from the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE HEART\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Bradley _Gard._ 211. 1739. =2.= Downing _Fr.

Bunyard and\r\nThomas, in the reference given, speak of it as one of the best and most\r\nprofitable cherries grown in the famous Kent cherry orchards. Early\r\nAmerican horticulturists describe it but it seems not to have been\r\nwidely grown in America and has probably long since passed from\r\ncultivation. It failed, according to Elliott, because it was a \"variable\r\nand uncertain bearer\" and while an early cherry \"not early enough to\r\ncompete with many new varieties.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Heart seems to have been mentioned first by Miller in 1734. A\r\nlittle later it is found to be described in both Germany and France,\r\nindicating that it must have been known and widely distributed before\r\nthe time given. It seems to have been brought to America before the War\r\nof the Revolution and to have been grown in this country under the\r\nseveral different names which are given in the list of synonyms. The\r\nfollowing description is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, somewhat erect, very healthy, rather\r\n    productive; branches stocky, somewhat angular, with large,\r\n    roundish, light colored lenticels; internodes of unequal length;\r\n    leaves medium in size, oval or obovate, sharply pointed; margin\r\n    finely serrate; petiole short, slender, tipped with two reniform,\r\n    orange-red glands; flowers medium in size; petals obovate.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early in June; rather small, roundish-cordate,\r\n    often one-sided, with a distinct suture; color whitish-yellow,\r\n    tinged and speckled with pale red in the sun; stem long, slender,\r\n    inserted in a wide, shallow cavity; skin firm; flesh light\r\n    colored, firm, half-tender, breaking, juicy, sugary, pleasant;\r\n    first quality; stone rather large, roundish-oval, with a pointed\r\n    apex.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDSOR\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

Both fruit and trees\r\ndeserve the approbation of cherry-growers. In color the cherries meet\r\nthe market demand, buyers preferring a dark-colored Sweet Cherry. None\r\nwould find fault with the appearance of Windsor. The flesh is firm and\r\nthe product stands harvesting and shipping well and at a season of the\r\nyear when brown-rot is usually rife this variety is fairly free from\r\nthis scourge of the Sweet Cherry. The quality is from good to very good,\r\nequaled but not surpassed by others of its class. But it is in its\r\ntree-characters that the superiority of Windsor is best shown. The trees\r\nhave the reputation of being the hardiest of the Bigarreaus and of\r\nthriving in many soils. They are usually fruitful. To offset these\r\nmerits, the trees have two or three rather serious faults. Thus, they do\r\nnot come in bearing early; they are tall and upright in growth, being\r\nalmost fastigiate, making it difficult to harvest the crop; and the load\r\nof fruit is too much clustered. Cherry-growers agree that the worst of\r\nall pests of this fruit is the robin and that the Windsor, for some\r\nreason or other, is the freest of its kind from this and other thieving\r\nbirds. From the behavior of the variety in New York, we can heartily\r\njoin with practically all who are growing this variety in recommending\r\nit as a late, market Sweet Cherry.\r\n\r\nWindsor originated in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century on the\r\nfarm of James Dougall, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and was introduced to\r\nfruit-growers in 1881 by Ellwanger & Barry, Rochester, New York. It has\r\nbeen planted extensively in many sections of this country for both\r\nhome and market use and is now offered for sale by a large number of\r\nnurserymen. The American Pomological Society added Windsor to its fruit\r\ncatalog list in 1885 and the variety still holds a place there. Though\r\nrather widely known in the United States the commercial culture of this\r\nvariety is almost wholly confined to New York. It seems as yet not to\r\nhave found its way to Europe, a fact to be regretted, for its many good\r\nqualities would soon make it known in the Old World where the Sweet\r\nCherry is better grown and more appreciated than in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINDSOR]\r\n\r\nTree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, very productive;\r\ntrunk thick, shaggy; branches stocky, very smooth, brown nearly\r\noverspread with ash-gray, with large lenticels; branchlets thick,\r\nrather short, brown overspread with light ash-gray, smooth, with few\r\nsmall, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\nLeaves four inches long, two inches wide, folded upward, obovate to\r\noval, thin; upper surface dark green, slightly rugose; lower surface\r\nlight green, pubescent; margin doubly crenate, glandular; petiole one\r\nand one-fourth inches long, tinged with dull red, with from one to\r\nthree globose, reddish glands of medium size on the stalk.\r\n\r\nBuds conical or pointed, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral\r\nbuds and in very numerous clusters variable in size, on short spurs;\r\nleaf-scars somewhat prominent; season of bloom intermediate; flowers\r\nwhite, one and one-fourth inches across; borne in scattering clusters,\r\nin ones and twos; pedicels one inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\ncalyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes greenish or with\r\na tinge of red, acute, glabrous within and without, reflexed; petals\r\nbroad-oval, slightly crenate, with short, blunt claws; filaments\r\nfive-sixteenths of an inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the\r\nstamens.\r\n\r\nFruit matures in late mid-season; three-fourths of an inch in\r\ndiameter, slightly oblong to conical, compressed; cavity deep, wide,\r\nflaring; suture a line; apex roundish, with a depression at the\r\ncenter; color very dark red becoming almost black; dots numerous,\r\nsmall, russet, obscure; stem slender, one and one-fourth inches\r\nlong, adherent to the fruit; skin thin, adhering to the pulp; flesh\r\nlight red, with reddish juice, tender, meaty, crisp, mild, sweet;\r\ngood to very good in quality; stone semi-free, ovate, flattened,\r\nblunt-pointed, with smooth surfaces; ventral suture rather prominent\r\nnear the apex.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

The trees are a little tender to cold, are not quite\r\nproductive enough to make the variety profitable and are, too, somewhat\r\nfastidious as to soils. To offset these defects, they are vigorous and\r\nhealthy and bear early. But the chief fault of the cherry from the\r\ncherry-grower's standpoint is to be found in the fruit. The flesh is\r\nsoft and the cherries will not stand handling in harvesting and shipping\r\nand are very susceptible to brown-rot and crack badly in wet weather.\r\nWood has special merit in the home collection, however, because of its\r\nearliness, its beautiful appearance and delicious flavor. It is one of\r\nthe first of the Sweet Cherries, is large and, as the color-plate shows,\r\nis a beautiful yellowish-white tinted with shades of crimson, with\r\nconspicuous russet dots--a beautiful fruit. The flesh separates readily\r\nfrom the skin, is tender, juicy, with an abundance of colorless juice\r\nand a flavor that has given it the reputation, wherever grown in\r\nAmerica, of being one of the best in quality. It would be hard to name\r\nanother cherry better suited for small plantations and it is to be hoped\r\nthat it will long be kept in the gardens of connoisseurs of good fruit.\r\n\r\nWood is one of the best of Professor J. P. Kirtland's[83] seedlings. It\r\nwas raised by him in 1842 at Cleveland, Ohio, and named in honor of\r\nReuben Wood, at one time Governor of Ohio. In 1856, it was added to the\r\nfruit list of the American Pomological Society where it still remains,\r\nbeing changed in 1909 to Wood with Governor Wood as a synonym. Its\r\npopularity is shown in the United States by the fact that practically\r\nevery nurseryman in this country lists this variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOD]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright-spreading, open, productive; trunk stout;\r\n    branches thick, smooth, dull reddish-brown covered with ash-gray,\r\n    with a few small lenticels; branchlets thick, reddish-brown\r\n    slightly overspread with ash-gray, smooth, glabrous, with a few\r\n    inconspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous, four and one-half inches long, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, obovate, thin; upper surface light\r\n    green, smooth; lower surface dull green, lightly pubescent; apex\r\n    acute, base abrupt; margin coarsely and doubly serrate, glandular;\r\n    petiole one and one-half inches long, slender, tinged with dull\r\n    red, with from one to three reniform, reddish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Buds large, long, pointed, very plump, free, arranged singly as\r\n    lateral buds or in small clusters on short spurs; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent; season of bloom intermediate; flowers one inch\r\n    across, arranged in twos and threes; pedicels one inch long,\r\n    slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube tinged with red, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes reddish, long, acute, glabrous on both\r\n    surfaces, reflexed; petals roundish, crenate, with short, blunt\r\n    claws; anthers yellowish; filaments one-eighth inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, equal to the stamens in length, sometimes defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; nearly one inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-cordate, compressed; cavity of medium depth, wide,\r\n    flaring; suture variable in depth, distinct, wide; apex roundish;\r\n    color shades of crimson on a yellowish-white background; dots\r\n    numerous, small, light russet, somewhat conspicuous, especially\r\n    just before maturity; stem slender, one and one-half inches long,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating from\r\n    the pulp; flesh whitish, with colorless juice, tender, meaty,\r\n    mild, sweet; very good in quality; stone clinging, rather large,\r\n    roundish, blunt, with smooth surfaces; with a broad, ventral\r\n    suture.\r\n\r\n    [83] Jared P. Kirtland, M. D., though now less well known than\r\n    some of his contemporaries, was one of the great pomologists of\r\n    his time and a man of notable achievements in other branches\r\n    of natural history as well. Professor Kirtland was born at\r\n    Wallingford, Connecticut, November 10, 1793, and died at East\r\n    Rockport, near Cleveland, Ohio, December 11, 1877. For sixty\r\n    years of a long life his avocation was the production of new\r\n    varieties of fruits and flowers and, though a half century has\r\n    passed since he ceased active work, the results of his labors\r\n    are yet to be found in the gardens and orchards of the whole\r\n    country. In pomology he gave special attention to breeding grapes,\r\n    raspberries, pears and cherries. He achieved success, too, as a\r\n    hybridizer of peonies and in the introduction of rare foreign\r\n    magnolias. Professor Kirtland is given credit as being the first\r\n    horticulturist successfully to bud and graft magnolias, an\r\n    achievement which has made possible their cultivation under many\r\n    conditions and to a degree of excellence that otherwise could\r\n    not be obtained. He was the founder of the Cleveland Society of\r\n    Natural History and was for many years its president. He was\r\n    a member of the American Philosophical Society, the highest\r\n    recognition for scientific work to be obtained in his time in this\r\n    country. He served as professor in several medical schools and\r\n    filled other places of honor and trust. From his boyhood we are\r\n    told that he was interested in natural history and was intimately\r\n    acquainted with the plants and animals of Ohio, having special\r\n    knowledge of birds and fishes, the propagation of the latter being\r\n    one of his hobbies. In pomology we owe him most for the many new\r\n    cherries he has given us, thirty varieties described in _The\r\n    Cherries of New York_ having come from his breeding grounds. Among\r\n    these are Wood, Pontiac, Powhatan, Tecumseh, Osceola, Kirtland and\r\n    Red Jacket, sorts scarcely surpassed for high quality and grown\r\n    commonly in America and to some extent wherever Sweet Cherries\r\n    will thrive. His 84 years seem to have been well ordered, given\r\n    almost wholly for the good of the public, and his name should be\r\n    cherished by pomologists among those who have done most for fruits\r\n    and fruit-growing on this continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRAGG\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasus_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

Trees on\r\nthe grounds of this Station are identical with English Morello but it\r\nmay be that here, and occasionally elsewhere, the older sort has been\r\nsubstituted for Wragg. In Iowa, where the new variety is most largely\r\ngrown, pomologists claim that it is distinct and that it is an\r\nimprovement on English Morello. Professor J. L. Budd, an authority on\r\nRussian cherries, believed that this sort is distinct and of Russian\r\norigin having, according to him, been brought to America by Ellwanger &\r\nBarry of Rochester, New York, in an importation of Russian trees.\r\nCaptain C. L. Watrous of Des Moines, Iowa, another prominent pomologist\r\nof that State, was of the opinion that Wragg came to light on the\r\ngrounds of J. Wragg, Waukee, Iowa, as a sprout from another tree.\r\nColonel G. B. Brackett, pomologist of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, who visited Mr. Wragg's place some years ago and compared\r\nthe new cherry with the English Morello, could find no distinguishing\r\ncharacters between the two. On the other hand, Mr. Wragg insisted that\r\nthey were distinct. The American Pomological Society calls Wragg and\r\nEnglish Morello the same. Those who believe that the two are distinct\r\nsay that the fruit of Wragg is larger, the trees hardier and that the\r\ncherries ripen a little later than those of English Morello. With the\r\ninformation now at hand it is impossible to say here whether or not\r\nWragg is distinct. A compiled description taken from the text describing\r\nthis cherry is so unsatisfactory that we offer none and refer the reader\r\nto that of English Morello from which it differs but little, if at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW SPANISH\r\n\r\n_Prunus avium_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Miller _Gard.

Even yet in tree-characters it is hardly equaled, surpassing\r\nWindsor, which has a notable tree, in several respects and falling short\r\nof it only in hardiness. The trees are large,--perhaps the largest of\r\nall the varieties of _Prunus avium_,--having an upright-spreading top\r\nwhich gives a large bearing surface and forms a canopy of splendid\r\nfoliage. The trees are vigorous, bear abundantly and regularly and come\r\nin bearing young, with the crop well distributed and not in clusters as\r\nis the case and the fault of Windsor. Unfortunately, the cherries,\r\nthough very good in most characters, do not come up to the trees in\r\npoints of superiority. They are rather smaller than those of Napoleon,\r\nthe greatest competitor of Yellow Spanish, and are more subject to\r\nattacks of brown-rot than several others of the Bigarreaus. As may be\r\nseen by comparing the color-plates, however, Yellow Spanish is rather\r\nthe handsomer of the two cherries, the crimson color being more evenly\r\ndistributed and the skin not having the mottled appearance of Napoleon.\r\nIn quality Yellow Spanish is the better of the two, having tenderer\r\nflesh and a sweeter and richer flavor. Yellow Spanish is notable in the\r\nnursery for its strong, upright growth and its large leaves, the leaves\r\nof no other cherry attaining so great a size. In blossoming time the\r\nvariety may be distinguished by the whiteness of the blossoms as they\r\nopen and a reddish tint as they drop. It is a mid-season cherry,\r\nripening after Wood and a few days before Napoleon. Despite the great\r\nage of the variety it still remains one of the best, furnishing proof,\r\nby the way, that varieties of cherries do not degenerate with age. In\r\nNew York Yellow Spanish cannot be spared from either home or commercial\r\nplantings.\r\n\r\nYellow Spanish is so old and so widely disseminated that its origin can\r\nonly be conjectured. From the name we naturally infer a Spanish nativity\r\nand yet it is almost equally well known as Bigarreau, a word of French\r\nderivation. Under the last name French pomologists believe that they\r\ntrace its history to the First Century of the Christian Era as the\r\nvariety described by Pliny under the name Cerasum Duracinum. The Germans\r\nand Austrians certainly knew this variety in the Eighteenth Century and\r\nprobably much earlier, an inference to be drawn from the references\r\ngiven. Parkinson, the English herbalist, described a cherry in 1629\r\nwhich he called the Biguarre Cherrie which later came to be known as the\r\nBigarreau or Graffion by English writers and which we now know to be\r\nYellow Spanish. Seven years later Gerarde described a Spanish cherry the\r\ndescription of which is not unlike our Yellow Spanish. Miller and\r\nForsyth, English writers, also at an early date described a Spanish\r\ncherry which may be the fruit of this discussion.\r\n\r\nFortunately we are well informed as to the history of Yellow Spanish in\r\nAmerica. Prince, one of the most accurate of American pomologists, in\r\n1832, gave the following historical account of the Graffion, or Yellow\r\nSpanish: \"This tree was imported from London by the father of the\r\nauthor, in the year 1802, under the name Yellow Spanish, and one of the\r\noriginal trees is now growing in his garden, where it produces\r\nabundantly, and there is little doubt that from his stock have\r\noriginated most of the trees of this kind now in our country, as he has\r\ntaken much pains to recommend it.\" Why Prince and other Americans came\r\nto call the variety introduced by the elder Prince of Europe as Yellow\r\nSpanish, as Bigarreau and Graffion, does not appear unless the younger\r\nPrince wanted to make the name in this country conform to that in most\r\ncommon usage in England at the time. Besides the names already given,\r\nYellow Spanish has been rather widely grown in America as Ox Heart and\r\nWhite Caroon. This variety was placed on the recommended list of the\r\nNational Congress of Fruit Growers, which afterwards became the American\r\nPomological Society, in 1848, under the name Bigarreau. The name was\r\nchanged in 1897 to Yellow Spanish and it now appears on the list of that\r\norganization as Spanish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW SPANISH]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large and vigorous, upright-spreading, rather\r\n    open-topped, productive; trunk thick, of medium smoothness;\r\n    branches stocky, reddish-brown covered with ash-gray, smooth\r\n    except for the numerous large lenticels; branchlets short, brown\r\n    nearly overspread with ash-gray, smooth, with small, slightly\r\n    raised, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous five and one-half inches long, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, obovate to elliptical; upper surface\r\n    dark green, nearly smooth, grooved along the midrib; lower\r\n    surface light green, lightly pubescent; apex acute, base variable\r\n    in shape; margin coarsely and doubly serrate, with small, dark\r\n    glands; petiole one and three-fourths inches long, thick, heavily\r\n    tinged with dull red, grooved along the upper surface, with from\r\n    one to four large, reniform, reddish-yellow glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Buds conical, plump, free, arranged singly or in small clusters\r\n    as lateral buds and from short spurs; leaf-scars prominent;\r\n    season of bloom intermediate; flowers white, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches across; borne in well-distributed clusters, in twos and in\r\n    threes; pedicels about one inch long, glabrous, green; calyx-tube\r\n    greenish, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes acute, reflexed; petals\r\n    oval, entire, strongly dentate at the apex, tapering to short,\r\n    blunt claws; filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; one inch or over in diameter,\r\n    cordate, compressed; cavity deep, wide, flaring; suture a mere\r\n    line; apex roundish, not depressed; color bright amber-yellow\r\n    with a reddish blush, slightly mottled; dots numerous, small,\r\n    light russet, obscure; stem one and one-half inches long, adherent\r\n    to the fruit; skin thin, tough, separating from the pulp; flesh\r\n    whitish, with colorless juice, tender, meaty, crisp, aromatic,\r\n    sprightly, sweet; very good to best in quality; stone free, ovate,\r\n    slightly flattened, oblique, with smooth surfaces; with two small,\r\n    blunt ridges along the ventral suture near the apex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR VARIETIES OF CHERRIES\r\n\r\n\r\n=À Coeur Hâtive.= _P. avium._ =1.= Mas _Pom.

It appeared on the\r\nfruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1899 and in 1909\r\nMorello Hâtive was given as a synonym. This variety, however, is of the\r\nAmarelle type while Morello Hâtive is a true Morello.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Amarelle mit Weissem Stempelpunct.= _P. cerasus._ =1.= Truchsess-Heim\r\n_Kirschensort_. 655, 656. 1819. =2.= Dochnahl _Führ.

We feel sure, however, that it\r\nis a distinct variety. Fruit large, roundish-cordate, truncate at the\r\nbase; suture shallow; stem long; cavity wide, shallow; skin glossy, pale\r\nyellow washed with carmine in the sun; flesh firm, fibrous, sweet, with\r\na sourness that disappears if allowed to remain on the tree; quality\r\ngood; stone oval, slightly flattened at the base; ripens the first of\r\nJuly in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n=American Amber.= _P. avium._ =1.= Kenrick _Am.

It held a place on the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society's list of fruits from 1862 until 1869. It\r\nresembles American Heart but differs in being a tender-fleshed fruit of\r\nregular outline. Tree productive; fruit hanging in bunches for a long\r\ntime without rotting. Fruit borne in threes or fours, hangs well, of\r\nmedium size, roundish-cordate often nearly round; stem long, slender,\r\ninserted in a slight, narrow cavity; skin very thin, smooth, glossy,\r\nclear, light amber becoming mottled and overspread with clear bright\r\nred; flesh amber, tender, sprightly, juicy, usually of only fair\r\nquality; pit large; season the last of June to the middle of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n=American Heart=. _P. avium._ =1.= _Mag.

This variety, introduced by\r\nThomas Rivers & Son, Sawbridgeworth, England, should not be confused\r\nwith an older French sort often known by the same name but of a\r\nreddish-brown color. Tree moderate in growth; fruit glossy, black,\r\nround, of medium size, produced in clusters; flesh charcoal-black, very\r\nrich in flavor.\r\n\r\n=Anstad.= _P. avium._ =1.= _Ont. Fr. Gr. Assoc.

The tree came\r\ninto bearing about 1840. In 1841, fruits were exhibited from trees\r\nintroduced into American collections from Italy as New Large Black\r\nBigarreau, and were thought by several people to be the Black Bigarreau\r\nof Savoy. Until 1857, all writers held these two varieties to be\r\ndistinct but Downing then declared them to be the same and on his\r\nauthority we combine the two. Tree vigorous, handsome; fruit large,\r\nregular, cordate, slightly obtuse; stem long, rather stout, set in a\r\nnarrow, even cavity; skin smooth, not very glossy, nearly black when\r\nmature; flesh dark purplish-red, firm, juicy, sweet, rich, slightly\r\nadherent to the stone; pit rather large; ripens the middle of July.\r\n\r\n=Black Hungarian Gean.= _P. avium._ =1.= _Lond.

He is doubtful whether it existed\r\nbefore the Eighteenth Century; Duhamel was the first to describe it in\r\n1768. The tree resembles the Cluster cherry and is probably but a\r\nvariation of the Cerise Commune type. Tree small; fruit generally\r\nattached in threes, of medium size, globular, compressed at the stem;\r\ncavity rather deep; apex small, somewhat prominent; stem of medium size,\r\nunequal in length; skin transparent, clear red, deeper when mature;\r\nflesh tender, white, juicy, sugary, strongly acidulated; stone medium in\r\nsize, roundish, turgid; ripens the middle of June.

This cherry\r\nwas introduced into America by Prince of Flushing, New York, and was\r\nthought by him to be the most suitable species to furnish stocks for\r\ndwarf trees. At best the variety reaches a height of from three to four\r\nfeet with branches very numerous, forming a dense shrub.

Tree vigorous, erect, productive; fruit borne in threes, medium in\r\nsize, obtuse-cordate, slightly compressed; suture wide; stem long,\r\nslender, set in a straight, deep cavity; skin firm, medium thick,\r\nchanging from lively red to reddish-brown; flesh yellowish, tender,\r\ncracking, with uncolored juice, sweet, aromatic; pit large for the\r\nfruit; season early.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Black Bigarreau.= _P. avium._ =1.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 69, 80.\r\n1866. =2.= Mortillet _Le Cerisier_ =2=:302. 1866.\r\n\r\nFruit large, distinctly heart-shaped; stem long; color jet black; flesh\r\ndark purple, firm, rich, sweet; excellent; season the last of June and\r\nthe first of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Eugene.= Species? =1.= _Ill.

Early May should not be\r\nconfused with a European cherry of the same name formerly grown upon the\r\ncontinent but now seldom seen.

As grown at the Geneva Station it is smaller\r\nand no better than Napoleon. Tree vigorous, hardy, healthy, unproductive\r\non the Station grounds. Fruit large, roundish-cordate, slightly\r\nflattened, with irregular surfaces; cavity deep; suture a line; stem of\r\nmedium thickness and length, adhering to the fruit; skin rather thin, of\r\nmedium toughness, adhering to the pulp, amber covered with light red,\r\nsometimes spotted; flesh whitish, juicy, stringy, tender, somewhat\r\nmeaty, crisp, sprightly, sweet; quality good; stone clinging, roundish,\r\nplump; ripens in mid-season.\r\n\r\n    [86] Oregon has given to pomology two notable breeders of cherries,\r\n    Seth Lewelling and C. E. Hoskins, the subject of this sketch.\r\n    Cyrus Edwin Hoskins was born on a farm in Clinton County, Ohio,\r\n    July 3, 1842, and there he grew to manhood. Almost at the first\r\n    call for men to defend the Union in the Civil War, Mr. Hoskins\r\n    responded and joined the 13th Ohio regiment, serving until the\r\n    close of the war. Returning to Ohio, he gave attention to fruit\r\n    culture, testing many varieties of several fruits and producing\r\n    some new grapes and berries. In 1877 Mr. Hoskins moved to Newberg,\r\n    Yamhill County, Oregon, settling on new land and thus becoming a\r\n    pioneer in the Northwest. His first pomological venture in Oregon\r\n    was in growing prunes, his orchard of this fruit being one of\r\n    the first, and he is credited with having built one of the first\r\n    evaporators for the curing of prunes in America. For some years he\r\n    maintained his prune ranch and evaporator, developing a product\r\n    that gave him the highest reputation in prune markets and made him\r\n    one of the leading authorities on this fruit in the United States.\r\n    Early in his orchard work in Oregon Mr. Hoskins began to produce\r\n    new varieties of cherries and soon offered for sale a number of\r\n    promising seedlings of which Vesta, Lake, Occident, Stryker and\r\n    Hoskins were most worthy. Unfortunately, ill health in the family\r\n    compelled Mr. Hoskins to move from Yamhill County, to which place,\r\n    after having spent several years in Jackson County, Oregon, and in\r\n    the Hawaiian Islands, he returned with the expectation of taking\r\n    up his work in breeding cherries and prunes, but his death, August\r\n    18, 1908, occurred before his work had been again well begun. The\r\n    Pacific Northwest owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Hoskins for the\r\n    spendid part he played in developing the fruit industry of that\r\n    region and pomologists the country over owe him much for his labors\r\n    in breeding cherries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hubbard.= _P. cerasus._ =1.= _Ill.

This variety,\r\nlisted by Prince, although much like Toussaint, has branches more\r\npendant than those of other weeping cherries. The Weeping or Pendulous\r\nMorello of Fish is included here. The head in this variety seldom\r\nexceeds four or five feet in diameter, and the slender branches droop on\r\nall sides until they trail on the ground; the fruit is of medium size\r\nand when fully ripe is of a pleasant acid flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Weeping Black Bigarreau.= _P. avium._ =1.= _Flor. & Pom._ 16. 1879.\r\n\r\n_Trauerknorpelkirsche._ =2.= Dochnahl _Führ.

He spent his life in\r\n    the place of his birth, dying January 18, 1885. His parents were\r\n    natives of Lexington, Massachusetts, who shortly before the birth\r\n    of Charles Downing, the eldest son, came to Newburgh, the father\r\n    establishing a shop for the manufacture of wagons, a business\r\n    which he soon abandoned to become a nurseryman. Here, in the first\r\n    successful nursery established in the region, were trained Charles\r\n    and Andrew Downing, receiving under the careful guidance of the\r\n    father a knowledge of the business and of fruits which with later\r\n    self instruction made them the most distinguished pomologists of\r\n    their day. With the death of the father in 1822, before Charles\r\n    had obtained his majority, the responsibility of conducting the\r\n    business and the support of the family devolved upon him. Andrew\r\n    J., the younger brother, in 1834, at the age of 19, united with\r\n    Charles in the management of the nursery business under the firm\r\n    name of C. & A. J. Downing, a partnership which lasted only until\r\n    1839. Charles continued in the nursery business for many years\r\n    during which time he became the foremost pomologist in the United\r\n    States and eventually, about 1850, sold his holdings to devote\r\n    himself to the study of varieties of fruits and the revision of\r\n    the _Fruits and Fruit Trees of America._ This great pomological\r\n    book was projected and published by Andrew but most of the work of\r\n    the book as it is now known was done by Charles in revising the\r\n    original and adding to its many editions. It is and has long been,\r\n    as all know, the highest authority on American fruits. Naturally\r\n    of an inquiring turn of mind Charles Downing studied closely the\r\n    qualities of the varieties that came under his observation and\r\n    seldom described without the fruit in hand. His variety orchard is\r\n    said to have contained at one time 1,800 varieties of apples and\r\n    1,000 pears with lesser numbers of the other fruits. A few trees of\r\n    this wonderful collection still stand. Charles Downing was one of\r\n    the most modest and retiring of men, in his younger days delighting\r\n    in the things of which his brother wrote and seldom putting pen\r\n    to paper until after his brother's death when he became a regular\r\n    contributor to horticultural publications over the signature \"C.\r\n    D.\" He was never known to make a public speech. He earned his high\r\n    distinction in American pomology by his accurate and conscientious\r\n    descriptions and discussions of varieties of fruits.\r\n\r\n    [85] Andrew Jackson Downing was born in Newburgh on the Hudson,\r\n    the town in which he always lived and which he loved, October 30,\r\n    1815. He perished while trying to save other passengers in the\r\n    burning of the steamer _Henry Clay_ on the Hudson River, July 28,\r\n    1852, at the age of 37. Andrew Downing's education was largely\r\n    acquired from self instruction although he attended the schools\r\n    of his native town and the academy in the adjoining village of\r\n    Montgomery. His father, a nurseryman, whose work was mentioned\r\n    in the sketch of Charles Downing, elder brother of Andrew, gave\r\n    the younger son every opportunity to cultivate an early developed\r\n    taste for horticulture, botany and the natural sciences. When but a\r\n    youth he joined his brother Charles as partner in a nursery firm, a\r\n    relationship maintained for but a few years and which he severed to\r\n    begin a career as a writer on landscape gardening and pomological\r\n    subjects. His first publication was a _Treatise on the Theory and\r\n    Practice of Landscape Gardening adapted to North America, with a\r\n    view to the Improvement of Country Residences, with Remarks on\r\n    Rural Architecture_, a book published in 1841, the author being but\r\n    26 years of age. The work passed into instant popularity and is the\r\n    word of authority which has told thousands of Americans what to do\r\n    to make their grounds beautiful. Within a few months so great was\r\n    the success of the first venture that in response to the demand\r\n    he published his _Cottage Residences, a_ companion book which was\r\n    received with equal favor, thus giving Andrew Downing first rank\r\n    as an authority on rural art. In 1845 the _Fruits and Fruit Trees\r\n    of America_, then and now the chief pomological authority of this\r\n    continent, was printed simultaneously in London and New York, a\r\n    second edition coming out in 1850. In 1846 Andrew Downing became\r\n    the founder and editor of the _Horticulturist_, which he continued\r\n    to publish until his death. In 1849 he wrote _Additional Notes and\r\n    Hints about Building in the Country_, published in Wightwick's\r\n    _Hints to Young Architects._ The summer of 1850 was spent in\r\n    England in the study of landscape gardening and rural architecture\r\n    from the result of which came his _Architecture of Country Houses._\r\n    His last work was the editing of Mrs. Loudon's _Landscape Gardening\r\n    for Ladies_ though _Rural Essays_ appeared after his death as a\r\n    collection of his writings with a memoir by George William Curtis\r\n    and a _Letter to his Friends_ by Frederika Bremer. He was employed\r\n    in planting the public grounds of the Capitol, the White House and\r\n    the Smithsonian Institution at Washington when he met his untimely\r\n    death. Downing is the creator of American landscape gardening\r\n    and shares with his brother Charles the honor of being the most\r\n    distinguished pomologist of the country. In the epoch-making\r\n    _Fruits and Fruit Trees of America_ Andrew Downing was the real\r\n    genius, Charles Downing the conscientious and painstaking student\r\n    who worked out the details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY AND REFERENCES, WITH ABBREVIATIONS USED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe list of books which follows contains all American pomological works\r\nin which the cherry is discussed at any length.
