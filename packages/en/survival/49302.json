At the present time the largest acreage is found in The western\r\nNorth-Central States and in the Mountain States.\r\n\r\nSweet clover is adapted to a wider range of climatic conditions than\r\nany of the true clovers, and possibly alfalfa.\r\n\r\nSweet clover will grow on practically all soil types to be found in\r\nthis country, provided the soil is not acid and is well inoculated.\r\n\r\nSweet clover is more drought resistant than alfalfa or red clover. It\r\nis quite resistant to alkali.\r\n\r\nThe lime requirement of sweet clover is as high as that of red clover\r\nor alfalfa. Maximum growth is obtained only on soils that are not acid.\r\n\r\nSweet clover usually will respond to applications of fertilizers and\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nIn the move humid sections of the country good stands usually are\r\nobtained by seeding with a nurse crop.\r\n\r\nOnly seed which germinates 75 per cent or more should be sown in the\r\nspring of the year unless the rate of seeding is increased to make up\r\nfor poor germination.\r\n\r\nSweet clover does best when seeded on a well-firmed seed bed which has\r\nonly sufficient loose soil on the surface to cover the seed.\r\n\r\nIt is very essential that inoculation be provided in some form if\r\nsuccess is to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe large number of failures in obtaining a stand of sweet clover\r\nare due primarily to acid soils, lack of inoculation, and seed which\r\ngerminates poorly.\r\n\r\nSpring seedings in general are satisfactory, but in the South excellent\r\nstands are obtained from midwinter seedings also Fall seedings are\r\nusually successful south of the latitude of southern Ohio.\r\n\r\nA Farmers' Bulletin (No. 820) on the utilization of sweet clover for\r\npasture, hay, and as a green-manure is about to be issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER: GROWING THE CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Page.\r\n\r\n  Introduction                           3\r\n\r\n  Species of sweet clover                4\r\n    White sweet clover                   5\r\n    Biennial yellow sweet clover         8\r\n    Annual yellow sweet clover           9\r\n    Other species of sweet clover        9\r\n\r\n  History                               10\r\n\r\n  Distribution                          10\r\n\r\n  Climatic adaptations                  12\r\n\r\n  Requirements for obtaining a stand    12\r\n    Soils suitable for sweet clover     13\r\n    Resistance to alkali                13\r\n    Need of lime on acid soils          14\r\n    Fertilizers                         17\r\n    Use of a nurse crop                 18\r\n    Choice of seed                      19\r\n    Preparation of the seed bed         21\r\n\r\n  Seeding                               22\r\n    Hulled sweet-clover seed            23\r\n    Unhulled sweet-clover seed          24\r\n    Rate of seeding                     25\r\n    Methods of seeding                  25\r\n\r\n  Inoculation                           27\r\n    The soil-transfer method            28\r\n    The pure-culture method             29\r\n\r\n  Treatment of the stand                30\r\n    Treatment the first season          30\r\n    Treatment the second season         32\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover in mixtures              32\r\n\r\n  Eradication of sweet clover           33\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet clover is an important forage crop in many regions. Although\r\none of the oldest of known plants, not until very recently has it\r\nbeen considered seriously as a forage plant in this country. The\r\nprincipal causes for not utilizing this crop were its aggressiveness\r\non uncultivated land in many localities, the tendency of the stems to\r\nbecome woody as they mature, and the refusal of stock to eat sweet\r\nclover before they had become accustomed to the bitter taste. Another\r\nreason was the fact that until recently red clover could be grown in\r\nthe eastern half of the United States without difficulty. In northern\r\nKentucky the continuous growing of tobacco or of tobacco and wheat\r\nimpoverished the soil to such an extent that crops no longer could be\r\ngrown successfully. Upon the abandoned farms in this section sweet\r\nclover was introduced as a honey plant. Owing to the remarkable yields\r\nof tobacco that were obtained on such farms after sweet clover had been\r\ngrown for a few years the acreage of this plant increased very rapidly.\r\nFor a number of years sweet clover has been grown on the Selma chalk\r\n(rotten-limestone) soils of Alabama and Mississippi as a soil-improving\r\ncrop. At the present time it is being cultivated in practically every\r\nState, and the acreage is increasing very rapidly.\r\n\r\nAfter it had been demonstrated that sweet clover would grow\r\nsuccessfully on soils too depleted for other crops, many experiments\r\nwere conducted to determine its value as forage. It was found that\r\nit was not only a valuable soil-improving crop, but that it made an\r\nexcellent pasture and hay plant, quite palatable and rich in protein.\r\n\r\nWhite sweet clover comprises a very large percentage of the acreage\r\nseeded to sweet clover at the present time. On this account this\r\nspecies ordinarily is referred to simply as \"sweat clover.\" The yellow\r\nbiennial species is designated as yellow sweet clover, and the annual\r\nyellow species as bitter clover, sour clover, or annual yellow sweet\r\nclover. This usage has been adopted in this bulletin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Seeds and seed pods of three species of\r\nMelilotus and seeds of alfalfa: 1. White sweet clover; 2, biennial\r\nyellow sweet clover; 3, annual yellow sweet clover, or sour clover; 4,\r\nalfalfa. The small figures in each drawing show the natural size of the\r\nseed. The venation and shape of the seed pods are important characters\r\nin distinguishing the different species of sweet clover.]\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of sweet clover should be preceded by a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the requirements for obtaining a stand. It can not be\r\ngrown successfully on all soils, as many assume from seeing it growing\r\nin uncultivated places. Neither will it thrive in many sections of the\r\ncountry without careful preparation of the seed bed. Sweet clover will\r\nnot grow successfully in acid soils unless lime is applied, but it\r\nwill make a good growth in soils too low in humus to grow red clover,\r\nprovided the soil is neutral or alkaline.\r\n\r\nSweet clover is an excellent plant to precede alfalfa, as the large\r\nroots do much toward breaking up and aerating the subsoil. Contrary to\r\nthe belief of many, it will not inoculate the soil for alfalfa unless\r\ninoculation is applied to the sweet clover. If, however, the soil\r\ncontains but few inoculating germs, the sweet clover will serve as a\r\nmedium to inoculate it thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of species of sweet clover are found throughout the world, and\r\nmost of them are native to temperate Europe and Asia as far east as\r\nTibet.\r\n\r\nWhite sweet clover,[1] yellow biennial sweet clover,[2] and yellow\r\nannual sweet clover[3] are the only species which have given sufficient\r\npromise as forage and green-manure crops in this country to warrant\r\ngrowing them under cultivation.\r\n\r\n[1] _Melilotus alba_ Dear.\r\n\r\n[2] _Melilotus officinalis_ (L.) Lam.\r\n\r\n[3] _Melilotus indica_ (L.) All.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the average person to distinguish between the\r\ndifferent species of sweet clover from an examination of the seeds\r\nor seed pods only. The differences are indicated in figure 1. Where\r\nthere is a question as to the identity of a sample of seed it should\r\nbe sent to a State agricultural experiment station or to one of the\r\nseed laboratories of the United States Department of Agriculture for\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nWhite sweet clover (fig. 2) is ordinarily referred to as melilotus\r\nor meliot in the South and merely as sweet clover in other portions\r\nof the country. When soil conditions are favorable for germination,\r\nsweet-clover seedlings will appear from one to two weeks after seeding.\r\nOn account of the biennial nature of the plants, they do not seem\r\nto make much growth above ground the first month or six weeks after\r\ngermination, but during this time they are developing root systems\r\nrapidly and thus becoming established, so to be able to withstand\r\nadverse conditions. Plants which have made no more than 2 inches of top\r\ngrowth very often have produced roots 6 inches or more in length (fig.\r\n3). The tap-root continues to develop rapidly throughout the growing\r\nseason the first year, and by autumn often reaches a length of 24 to 36\r\ninches and a diameter of three-fourths to 1 inch at the crown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--A branch of white sweet clover, showing the\r\nlong, loose racemes which bear white flowers.]\r\n\r\nAfter the root system becomes established the plants produce an\r\nupright, branching, leafy growth, which under ideal growing conditions\r\nmay reach a height of 48 inches the first season, but more often 18 to\r\n30 inches. A large quantity of reserve food is stored in the tap-root\r\nthe first season; this reserve food enables the plants to make a rapid\r\nand vigorous growth early the following spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--White sweet-clover plants collected from a plat\r\nsix weeks from the date of seeding. An extensive root system such as is\r\nshown here is often developed before much growth is made above ground.]\r\n\r\nToward the end of the growing season of the first year a number of\r\nbuds, which serve to produce the second year's growth (fig. 4), are\r\nformed on the crowns of the plants. After these buds are formed the\r\nplants may be clipped quite close to the ground, as the buds are not\r\ndeveloped until the plants have made sufficient growth to live through\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\nDuring the second season sweet clover makes a rapid, erect, stemmy,\r\nbranching growth from 5 to 10 feet in height, the plants producing\r\nonly a moderate number of leaves, which drop as the seed matures. A\r\nlarge number of loose racemes bearing white flowers (see fig. 2) are\r\nproduced during the flowering period, which usually lasts from three to\r\nfive weeks.\r\n\r\nBefore sweet clover has made a growth of 12 to 18 inches it closely\r\nresembles alfalfa. The plants may be distinguished from alfalfa by the\r\nabsence of pubescence on the under side of the leaves and by their\r\nbitter taste. When they are in bloom they may be identified easily\r\nby their long, loose racemes of white flowers and their open, coarse\r\ngrowth. Unlike alfalfa, the seeds are ordinarily found singly in the\r\npods. Two seeds may occasionally be found, and very rarely three, in a\r\nsingle pod.\r\n\r\nSTRAINS OF WHITE SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nA number of different strains of white sweet clover are to be found in\r\nthe average field, but most of them are not as marked or as conspicuous\r\nas the different strains of red clover. The principal differences\r\nbetween strains of sweet clover are in leafiness, habit of growth, and\r\ndate of blooming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Buds produced on the crown of a sweet-clover\r\nplant at the end of the first season's growth. These buds will produce\r\nthe first crop the second season.]\r\n\r\nOccasional plants are especially heavy seed producers and bear many\r\npods containing more than one seed. Other plants bloom earlier than\r\nthe average date for white sweet clover, and it may be possible by\r\nselecting such strains to find one which matures early enough to\r\nproduce two crops a season at high altitudes in the northern sections\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nFields of an exceptionally early blooming strain were found in\r\nIllinois, Iowa, and North Dakota in the summer of 1916. The plants\r\nwere different in type of growth from the ordinary white sweet clover,\r\nbeing most conspicuous from the fact that they were in bloom during\r\nthe first week of June, which is at least three weeks earlier than the\r\nordinary species should bloom in these localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Root of white sweet clover (on the left)\r\nand of biennial yellow sweet clover (on the right). These roots were\r\ncollected on October 28, 1915, at Arlington, Va., from adjacent plats\r\nseeded to cuts and sweet clover on April 10, 1915. Note the difference\r\nin the size of the roots. Tubercles are present on the right-hand side\r\nof each root.]\r\n\r\nAn annual white-flowered sweet clover was found in several localities\r\nin the fall of 1916. The seed which produced these plants was grown\r\nin Alabama. These plants resembled _Melilotus alba_ in most respects\r\nexcept that they were strictly annual. They flowered and matured\r\nseed abundantly in South Dakota and North Dakota. It has not been\r\ndetermined whether this is a distinct species or merely an annual\r\nstrain of the species mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIENNIAL YELLOW SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nBiennial yellow sweet clover ordinarily is referred to in the seed\r\ntrade and among farmers in regions where it is grown simply as yellow\r\nsweet clover. The plants of this species are somewhat more decumbent\r\nthe first year, and ordinarily with more deeply notched leaves than the\r\nwhite-flowering species. Yellow sweet clover usually grows from 3 to 5\r\nfeet in height. This plant blooms from 10 to 14 days earlier than the\r\nwhite species, and for this reason it is advisable to sow seed of both\r\nplants when they are to be used for bee pasturage. On account of the\r\nfiner stems of yellow sweet clover it is preferred in some localities\r\nfor hay, but since it does not produce as much forage as white sweet\r\nclover and there is much less demand for the seed, it constitutes only\r\na very small percentage of the total acreage. The much larger root\r\ngrowth of the white species, as illustrated in figure 5, is desirable\r\nbecause of the additional quantity of hummus added to the soil.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the yellow species may usually be distinguished from those\r\nof other species, as some of them are slightly mottled with purple. The\r\nshape of the calyx, which is generally present on unhulled seed, and\r\nthe venation of the seed pods also distinguish it. (See fig, 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL YELLOW SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nAnnual yellow sweet clover, more commonly known as sour clover or\r\nbitter clover, is found chiefly in the South and Southwest. This plant\r\nis considered a noxious weed in grain fields throughout the Southwest.\r\nIt is claimed that the flavor of the seed which is imparted to wheat\r\ncan not be removed. Bakers decidedly object to this flavor, stating\r\nthat it injures bread. Sour clover is grown rather extensively as a\r\ngreen-manure crop in orchards in portions of Arizona and southern\r\nCalifornia and when properly handled in these regions it has given\r\nprofitable results. As the seed is obtained from the screenings of\r\nwheat, it is offered on the market at a very low price. Occasionally it\r\nis sold for the yellow biennial sweet clover. Seed of this plant should\r\nnot be sown in any part of the United States except the extreme South\r\nor Southwest, and then only as a green hay manure crop. Where it is\r\ndesired to plant sweet clover for pasturage or for the biennial white\r\nor biennial yellow species should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SPECIES OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nThirteen species of sweet clover have been tested by the Office of\r\nForage-Crop Investigations to determine their economic value. With\r\nthe exception of white sweet clover, yellow biennial sweet clover, and\r\nyellow annual sweet clover, but four species in the somewhat limited\r\ntests have given sufficiently good results to merit special attention,\r\nand none have so far proved superior to white sweet clover, which is\r\nnow extensively grown in many States.\r\n\r\nA species of Trigonella[4] is often referred to as blue-flowered\r\nmelilotus or blue-flowered sweet clover. While this plant is closely\r\nrelated to the plants belonging to the genus Melilotus, it does not\r\nbelong to this genus and therefore should not be called sweet clover.\r\nIt is an erect, quite leafy, very fragrant annual, which produces a\r\nfair growth. It may prove of value as a green-manure crop or as a catch\r\ncrop under certain conditions, but at the present time it is not to be\r\nrecommended where sweet clover can be grown successfully. In most tests\r\nTrigonella has produced less forage than the better species of sweet\r\nclover.\r\n\r\n[4] _Trigonella caerulea_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet clover has been used as a honey plant and for forage and\r\ngreen-manure for more than 2,000 years in the Mediterranean region,\r\nalthough it has never been considered of much importance.\r\n\r\nThe first authentic report of sweet clover in the United States was\r\nin 1739, when Gronovius stated in his Flora Virginica that it was\r\ncollected by Clayton. Cutler reported its presence in New England\r\nas early as 1785, and Pursh in 1814 stated in his Flora Americæ\r\nSeptentrionulis that it is found on the gravelly shores of rivers from\r\nPennsylvania to Virginia. Elliott reported the presence of yellow\r\nbiennial sweet clover in his Sketch of the Botany of South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia in 1824, and Beck found the species _Melilotus leucantha_[5] in\r\nthe Northern States in 1833.\r\n\r\n[5] Undoubtedly meaning _Melilotus alba_.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Prof. Tutwiller, of Green Springs Academy, Ala., received a\r\nsmall quantity of white sweet-clover seed from the secretary to the\r\nUnited States consul in Chile. Part of this seed was planted by a young\r\nman named Stendwick on his father's plantation on the prairie limestone\r\nbelt, where it flourished. This plantation later became the property\r\nof J. T. Collins who, realizing the value of this plant, sold seed to\r\npersons in many States. Not until recently has sweet clover been grown\r\nto any extent as a cultivated crop in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile sweet clover is to be found growing in many countries and on all\r\nthe continents of the world, it is native to temperate Europe and Asia\r\nas far east as Tibet. It is grown to a limited extent in England,\r\nwhile in the eastern part of Scotland a small quantity is considered\r\nvaluable in hay on account of its agreeable odor. The famous Cruyere\r\ncheese of Switzerland owes its flavor to yellow sweet clover. In\r\nGermany it has given very good results when used as a green-manure,\r\nwhile in parts of Russian Poland and Austria-Hungary it is grown as\r\na green-manure, pasturage, and hay crop on poor soils. This plant is\r\nused for forage and as a soil-improving crop in the central provinces\r\nof India, while sour clover, commonly referred to as _Melilotus\r\nparviflora_, is credited with furnishing 75 per cent of the feed for\r\nthe cattle of King Island, Tasmania, which produce the best beef and\r\nbutter sold on the Tasmania market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Outline map of the United States, showing the\r\nlocalities where sweet clover is grown for forage or for green-manure.\r\nEach dot or circle indicates a county where 50 acres or more is grown\r\nunder cultivation. The solid dots represent white or yellow sweet\r\nclover; the circles represent annual yellow sweet clover.]\r\n\r\nAt the present time sweet clover is grown rather extensively as a field\r\ncrop in the limestone regions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky,\r\nin northern Illinois, and throughout the western North-Central and\r\nMountain States (fig. 6): in fact, it is grown as a cultivated crop to\r\nsome extent in nearly every State in the Union. Comparatively little\r\nsweet-clover seed is sown in the Atlantic Coast States, since there\r\nthe soils are for the most part acid, and heavy applications of lime\r\nwill be necessary before sweet clover can be grown successfully. It\r\nis questionable whether this plant will ever be of much importance in\r\nthe South Atlantic States, as cowpeas, soy beans, and crimson clover\r\nwill make a fair growth on those soils in their present condition.\r\nThe acreage of sweet clover probably will increase in the New\r\nEngland States, where it should prove of value as pasturage and as a\r\nsoil-improving crop on soils where red clover no longer can be grown.\r\nSweet clover grows abundantly in the limestone regions of northwestern\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nA much larger acreage of sweet clover is grown in northern Illinois\r\nthan in any other of the eastern North-Central States. The conditions\r\nin the western North-Central States and in the Mountain States appear\r\nto be particularly adapted to this crop. It is in that part of the\r\ncountry that the largest acreage is found, and, with the exception\r\nof the limestone regions of the South, that the least difficulty is\r\nexperienced in obtaining a stand.\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the Mountain and Pacific Coast States, especially\r\nUtah, where it has not been tested carefully or where red clover or\r\nalfalfa can be grown successfully, sweet clover is looked upon as a\r\nweed. It may rightly be considered a weed in the irrigated regions of\r\nthe West and Northwest, where it grows luxuriantly on ditch Banks.\r\nThe dissemination of this plant in all parts of the country has been\r\nhastened by beekeepers who have seeded it in waste places for the\r\nproduction of honey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATIC ADAPTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet clover is adapted to a wider range of climatic conditions than\r\nany of the true clovers and possibly alfalfa; in fact, it may be grown\r\nsuccessfully in any portion of the United States except, perhaps,\r\nFlorida, and in Florida trials with biennial yellow sweet clover,\r\nannual sweet clover, and _Melilotus suaveolens_ have been successful.\r\nApparently neither the high temperatures of the South nor the cold\r\nwinters of the North severely affect the plants, provided there is\r\nsufficient moisture in the soil. Comparatively little winterkilling\r\nis experienced in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and North Dakota when the\r\nseed is sown in close drills or broadcasted. Although approximately 50\r\nper cent of the sweet clover seeded in rows 3 feet apart at Moccasin,\r\nMont., was killed by the unusually severe winter of 1915-16, no\r\nwinterkilling was noted in plats seeded in close drills.\r\n\r\nSweet clover thrives in the more humid parts of the country, as well\r\nas in the semiarid regions where the rainfall is but three-fifths of\r\nthat required for the normal growth of such crops as red clover and\r\ntimothy. In the semiarid regions of the West sweet clover has proved to\r\nbe somewhat more drought resistant than alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING A STAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requirements for obtaining a stand of sweet clover are somewhat\r\nexacting. It is for this reason that so many failures have been\r\nexperienced. It must not be assumed, because sweet clover is found\r\ngrowing luxuriantly in many waste places and on uncultivated land, that\r\na stand may be obtained by planting it at any time of the year, in any\r\nmanner, and under all conditions. Throughout the eastern and southern\r\nportions of the country, with the exception of a few regions rich in\r\nlimestone, much care must be used in the preparation of the seed bed,\r\nthe selection of seed, and the manner of seeding if success is to be\r\nexpected. For this reason it is necessary to understand fully the\r\nrequirements for obtaining and maintaining a successful stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS SUITABLE FOR SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nSweet clover thrives on the adobe and granitic soils of the Pacific\r\ncoast; upon the gumbo, hardpan, prairie, and sandy soils of the western\r\nNorth-Central States; and upon the heavy clay, loam, limestone,\r\nand sandy soils of the South and East. In fact, it has been grown\r\nsuccessfully on all the principal soil types of the United States where\r\nthe soils were not acid and were well inoculated. It grows luxuriantly\r\non the Selma chalk (rotten-limestone) soils of Alabama and upon soils\r\nrich in calcium carbonate in many parts of the country where the\r\nlack of nitrogen and humus has caused large numbers of farms to be\r\nabandoned. The plants thrive on newly exposed heavy clay soils and\r\nupon steep embankments where little else will grow. Sweet clover is\r\nmore tolerant of poor drainage, overflow, and seepage conditions than\r\nalfalfa. In irrigated sections, especially where the reservoir system\r\nis in use, large bodies of land are likely to become useless for the\r\ngrowth of alfalfa because of the rising of the water table. On such\r\nareas sweet clover will make a vigorous growth. However, maximum growth\r\nis to be expected only on well-drained soil.\r\n\r\nSweet clover will do well on many soils which are not fertile enough\r\nto grow red clover or alfalfa, and it is on these soils that it will\r\nprove most valuable. Like many other plants, it makes its best growth\r\non fertile soils rich in calcium carbonate, although it will make\r\nsufficient growth on poor soils which are not acid to warrant planting\r\nit on them. Many hilly pastures may profitably be seeded to sweet\r\nclover. It will not only make a valuable addition to the forage of\r\nthese pastures but will improve the soil so that grasses will grow more\r\nabundantly. Some of the best pastures in the Middle West are composed\r\nof bluegrass, timothy, and sweet clover.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESISTANCE TO ALKALI.\r\n\r\nSweet clover grows successfully on soils in the West which apparently\r\nare too alkaline for grains or alfalfa. The Wyoming Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station reports that it has obtained good yields of sweet\r\nclover on seepage land which is so strongly alkaline that no other\r\nplants except some of the native grasses will survive, while the\r\nCalifornia Agricultural Experiment Station found that sweet clover will\r\nwithstand alkali to a remarkable degree. Prof. F. S. Harris, agronomist\r\nof the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station at Logan, claims that it is\r\none of the most alkali-resistant crops grown in Utah, and that in and\r\n1913 and 1914 quite an industry developed in some parts of that State\r\nin growing sweet clover for hay and seed on land too alkaline for other\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a circular letter on the culture of sweet clover,\r\napproximately 100 county agents and extensive growers of this crop\r\nlocated in many parts of the West state that this plant is one of the\r\nmost alkali-resistant plants grown in their respective districts. In\r\nCrook County, Oreg., a good stand was obtained from April seeding in\r\n1915 on a 20-acre demonstration field of sandy loam bottom land so\r\nstrongly alkaline from black alkali that only salt grass was growing on\r\nit before it was planted to sweet clover. This field pastured from 18\r\nto 28 head of calves, cows, and horses from June 1 to October 1 without\r\nbeing irrigated. Sweet clover generally will grow on soils where salt\r\ngrass[6] will survive, and it is very much superior to this grass as\r\npasture. After the drainage of water-logged land on which there is a\r\nsurface accumulation of alkali, it is the common practice in parts of\r\nUtah to grow sweet clover for several years before planting alfalfa. It\r\nis often stated that alkali land will grow less tolerant crops after\r\nsweet clover has been grown on it for a few years. The long roots\r\nwill open up the subsoil and cause better drainage, thereby affording\r\nan excellent means for removing the salts from the soil, as they are\r\nreadily soluble in water.\r\n\r\n[6] _Distichlis spicata_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEED OF LIME ON ACID SOILS.\r\n\r\nSweet clover, like many other legumes, requires a soil containing\r\nan abundance of limestone if a maximum growth is to be expected.\r\nThroughout the world it makes a luxuriant growth only on calcareous\r\nsoils. On the black prairie limestone soils of Alabama and Mississippi\r\nit grows luxuriantly, although in this region it is very seldom found\r\non the outcroppings of red clay, which are acid. The distribution\r\ncorresponds sharply with the line of demarcation between the black\r\nprairie soils and other soil types. In some places sweet clover makes a\r\nvigorous growth on the Selma chalk (rotten-limestone) soils, while none\r\nis to be found on red post-oak clay but a few yards away; yet sweet\r\nclover will grow on the red post-oak clay after the soil has received\r\nan application of lime. It will thrive on the bald lime-rock spots\r\nand rotten-limestone hills of Mississippi, which are so barren that\r\npractically no other plants will survive. Thus it appears that lime is\r\nessential for the maximum growth of sweet clover in this Region.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the exceptional growth of sweet clover in north-central\r\nKentucky is undoubtedly the fact that these soils contain an abundant\r\nsupply of limestone. The Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nstates that this area is the only portion of the State where sweet\r\nclover is being grown with general success without applying lime.\r\n\r\nSoils on which sweet clover is aggressive are almost invariably\r\nalkaline or but slightly acid. This plant is often found in valleys of\r\nstreams in localities where the soils are supposedly acid, but such\r\nstreams generally have their origin in limestone areas or flow through\r\nlimestone regions, and calcium carbonate is thus deposited in these\r\nvalleys during flood periods with the sedimentary deposits from flood\r\nwaters. Sweet clover often appears in deep cuts along highways or\r\nrailroads in localities where the soil is known to be acid and where\r\nsweet clover has not previously grown. In many of these cuts the acid\r\nsoil has been removed and neutral or alkaline subsoil exposed, or\r\nlimestone has been used in ballasting or road making and the dust has\r\nblown on the exposed soil. It is a very common occurrence to find sweet\r\nclover making an abundant growth along macadamized roads from which the\r\nwind has scattered the finely pulverized limestone.\r\n\r\nAn application of burnt lime or finely ground limestone has made the\r\ndifference between success and failure in most experiments which have\r\nthus far been conducted on decidedly acid soils. (Fig. 7.)\r\n\r\nA number of sweet-clover experiments were performed on acid soils and\r\non adjacent plats or fields of the same type of soil that had received\r\napplications of limestone varying from 1 to 4 tons to the acre. There\r\nwas a marked difference in the stands obtained and in the growth of the\r\nplants on the limed and unlimed areas. In some cases the difference in\r\ngrowth was so marked that the last round of the lime spreader could be\r\ndistinguished at some distance from the plats. The stands were much\r\nheavier on the limed areas and the plants made from two to three times\r\nmore growth than those on the unlimed plats. Yields of hay were doubled\r\non soils that received only sufficient limestone to neutralize the\r\nacids in the surface soil, although the yields were further increased\r\nwhen more limestone was added.\r\n\r\nMr. W. E. Watkins, county agent of Allen County, Kans., made counts of\r\nthe number of plants which winterkilled during the winter of 1914-15\r\non given areas of limed and unlimed soil. It was found that from 15\r\nto 35 per cent more plants winterkilled on the unlimed soil than on\r\nthe limed areas. That portion of the unlimed field on which the fewest\r\nplants winterkilled was found to have the lowest lime requirement.\r\nOn the unlimed areas with a low lime requirement 15 per cent more\r\nplants winterkilled than on the limed areas; on those with a high lime\r\nrequirement the increase in winterkilling was 33 per cent. In the fall\r\nof 1914 the hay cut from the limed areas exceeded that from the areas\r\nwith a low lime requirement by 600 pounds per acre and exceeded that\r\nfrom the areas of high lime requirement by 4,000 pounds per acre. In\r\nJuly, 1915, the increase in hay yield on the limed areas over that from\r\nthe areas with a low and with a high lime requirement was 2,300 and\r\n9,400 pounds per acre, respectively. The area of high lime requirement\r\nreturned a small yield in 1914 and no hay in 1915.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that sweet clover is as sensitive to soil acidity\r\nas red clover or alfalfa, a large percentage of the acreage thus far\r\nseeded in the eastern half of the United States has been composed of\r\nacid soils, and this soil acidity undoubtedly is responsible for a very\r\nlarge percentage of the failures with sweet clover in this section.\r\nWhere sweet clover is to be sown on acid soils a sufficient quantity of\r\nlime should first be applied to at least neutralize the fields in the\r\nsoil to a depth of 6 inches. An application of 1 ton of burnt lime or\r\n2 tons of finely ground limestone will usually be sufficient for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Sweet-clover plants, showing the effect of lime\r\nupon their growth. The plants at the left represent the average growth\r\non the unlimed portion of a field; the plants at the right show the\r\naverage growth on the limed part of the same field.]\r\n\r\nFields have been noted where sweet clover was making a fair growth\r\non apparently acid soils. Such fields usually are rich in humus or\r\nphosphorus and are exceptional cases rather than the rule.\r\n\r\nSoil types which have slightly acid surface soils and alkaline subsoils\r\nwill grow sweet clover successfully, provided the acid soil is not more\r\nthan 6 to 12 inches in depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that sweet clover thrives on the barren Selma\r\nchalk (rotten-limestone) hills of Alabama and Mississippi and grows\r\nabundantly on worn-out, abandoned land in north-central Kentucky, it\r\nis often assumed that it will grow on soils too depleted in plant\r\nfood to produce other crops. These regions represent soils which have\r\nbecome exhausted primarily in nitrogen and humus as the result of\r\ncontinuous cropping with nonleguminous plants. Some of these soils\r\ncontain sufficient phosphorus and potassium for fair crop production,\r\nalthough this supply may be in such a condition that it will not\r\nbecome available fast enough to supply the needs of most crops. Sweet\r\nclover, like all legumes, has the power to extract nitrogen from the\r\natmosphere, and on account of its extensive root system it is able to\r\nobtain phosphorus and potassium from a larger area than most plants.\r\nThe large roots not only add a quantity of humus and nitrogen to the\r\nsoil but they also open it up to a considerable depth, thus providing\r\nbetter aeration and improving its physical condition. Improved physical\r\ncondition causes the bacterial flora to increase and thereby indirectly\r\ncauses a larger quantity of unavailable phosphorus and potassium to be\r\nmade available for plant use.\r\n\r\nOn soils which are known to be low in phosphorus or potassium an\r\napplication of fertilizer containing the necessary element should be\r\nmade when sweet clover is sown without a nurse crop. However, when\r\nit is sown with a nurse crop or in the late summer or early fall on\r\ngrain stubble, the residues left in the soil from fertilizers applied\r\nto the nurse crop will, under ordinary conditions, be sufficient for\r\nthe plants. That sweet clover will respond readily to applications of\r\nphosphorus on soils low in this element has been well demonstrated by\r\nthe farmers of Livingston County, Ill. In this county finely ground\r\nrock phosphate was applied to a portion of a number of fields at the\r\nrate of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds per acre. The phosphate was thoroughly\r\nincorporated with the soil just before seeding oats and sweet clover.\r\nIn the growth of sweet clover there was a marked difference the\r\nfollowing year between the treated and untreated portions of the\r\nfields. Those portions of the fields which received an application of\r\nphosphate not only contained many more plants on a given area, but the\r\nvigor and growth of the plants were most marked. On June 1 the plants\r\non the treated areas were 12 to 15 inches taller than those on the\r\nuntreated parts of the fields. This difference in the thickness of\r\nstand and the height of plants was so striking that the last round of\r\nthe phosphate spreader was plainly distinguishable.\r\n\r\nYields of sweet-clover hay have been increased as much as 2 tons per\r\nacre from applications of barnyard manure. Such an increased yield\r\nwould be equal approximately to 8 tons of green-manure. Some people\r\nmay consider it poor farm practice to apply manure to such crops as\r\nsweet clover, but it is very probable that the cumulative effect of the\r\nincreased yields of the following crops, especially on soils low in\r\norganic matter, will be greater than if the manure is applied to other\r\ncrops. Heavy applications of manure to the preceding crop should also\r\ngreatly benefit sweet clover.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF A NURSE CROP.\r\n\r\nIf sweet clover is to become an important crop throughout the\r\nNorth-Central States it must necessarily be seeded with grain. Good\r\nsuccess has been obtained by seeding sweet clover in the spring on\r\nwinter grain or with spring grain on soil that was inoculated and not\r\nacid. Seed may be broadcasted in the early spring on winter grain when\r\nthe ground is in a honeycombed condition, or it may be sown later when\r\nthe ground may be cultivated. A large acreage of sweet clover is sown\r\nin the western North-Central States and in Illinois in the spring with\r\noats, barley, or wheat as a nurse crop. Early varieties of oats and\r\nspring wheat have given somewhat better results in portions of the\r\nNorthwest than barley. In Illinois oats are used almost entirely. Only\r\na few fields were noted where flax had been used as a nurse crop, but\r\nin these fields it was successful. In wet seasons the sweet clover may\r\nmake a growth sufficiently large to interfere seriously with harvesting\r\nthe flax. On this account this combination should be tested thoroughly\r\nin an experimental way before being recommended for general field\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nIn those sections of the country where the moisture supply is limited,\r\nsweet clover should be sown without a nurse crop. Failure to obtain a\r\nstand is more likely to occur when the seed is sown with grain than\r\nwhen it is sown alone, because during dry weather, which is likely to\r\noccur when the grain is maturing, the supply of moisture in the soil is\r\napt to be insufficient for both crops. When this condition prevails the\r\nclover will suffer badly and in some cases be killed. When sweet clover\r\nis sown with a nurse crop it is strongly recommended that the grain be\r\nseeded at not more than two-thirds the usual rate. This will give the\r\nsweet clover a much better chance than when a full seeding is made.\r\nWhen severe droughts occur it may be necessary to cut the grain for hay\r\nif the stand is to be saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF SEED.\r\n\r\nOn account of the low germination of much of the sweet-clover seed\r\noffered for sale it is very important that seed be tested for\r\ngermination before planting. Low germination usually is due to the\r\nfact that many of the seeds remain hard after they have been in\r\nthe germinator or soil for a month or more. The seed coats of hard\r\nsweet-clover seeds become permeable to water very slowly, if at all, in\r\nstorage. The germination of such seeds is greatly increased, however,\r\nwhen they are subjected for a time to alternating temperatures, such as\r\nfreezing and thawing. It is on this account that unhulled seed, which\r\ngerminates poorly in the laboratory, often will produce good stands\r\nwhen sown during the winter. When sweet clover is to be sown in the\r\nspring it is very important that only hulled seed which germinates\r\n75 per cent or more be sown. As explained later under the heading\r\n\"Seeding,\" unhulled seed which has a low germination should be used for\r\nseeding only during the winter months, so that there will be sufficient\r\ntime for the alternating temperatures of winter and early spring to\r\ncause it to germinate during favorable weather.\r\n\r\nHulled seed usually germinates much better than unhulled seed, as is\r\nshown in Table I.\r\n\r\nTable I.--_Germination and hard seed content of samples of\r\nsweet-clover seed, hulled, and unhulled, from different sources._\r\n\r\n                                Average percentage of--\r\n                   Number of\r\n  Description.      samples.

The low\r\ngermination of the southern-grown seed is probably due to the fact that\r\na very large percentage of it is flailed out and sown in the hull.\r\nNorthern-grown seed generally is thrashed with either a grain separator\r\nor a clover huller. Imported seed always is hulled. In hulling seed the\r\nrasps or concaves of the machines scratch the seed coats sufficiently\r\nto permit water to penetrate them, so that the germination is greatly\r\nincreased. Apparently there is no reason why southern-grown seed when\r\nit is properly hulled should not germinate as well as northern-grown\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nSince the Ames scarifying machine (fig. 8)[7] has been placed on the\r\nmarket, it is possible to buy scarified seed. This machine is so\r\nconstructed that the seed is forced through a conveyor, part of which\r\nis covered with sandpaper. When the seed comes in contact with the\r\nsandpaper it is scratched, so that water will penetrate the seed coats.\r\nWhen this machine is run properly the germination of seed is greatly\r\nincreased, but when carelessly operated germination may be lessened, as\r\nmany of the seeds may be broken.\r\n\r\n[7] This machine was invented by Prof. H. D. Hughes, of the Iowa State\r\nCollege at Ames. A United States patent covering this device has been\r\nissued and dedicated to the free use of the public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Ames hulling and scarifying machine.]\r\n\r\nThe retarded germination of sweet-clover seed may be overcome by\r\nsoaking it in commercial concentrated sulphuric acid for 20 minutes.\r\nIt should then be washed quickly, using running water if possible, as\r\nsulphuric acid becomes very hot when mixed with small proportions of\r\nwater. A great deal of water therefore is necessary in order to lessen\r\nthe danger of burning. The seed should be dried quickly by spreading\r\nit out on a floor or canvas, and it should be stirred at intervals.\r\nUnhulled seed should never be treated with sulphuric acid. When only a\r\nsmall quantity of sulphuric acid comes in contact with the hulls a very\r\nhigh temperature will result and the seed will be killed. The treatment\r\nof seed with sulphuric acid for seeding on a field scale is not to be\r\nrecommended, in view of the fact that as good or better results may be\r\nobtained by using scarified seed.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that seed of the desired species be obtained.\r\nMany lots of sweet-clover seed offered for sale on the market consist\r\nof mixtures of the yellow and white species, and many samples also are\r\nadulterated with alfalfa. Seed which is simply labeled sweet clover\r\nshould never be purchased, as seed so labeled may be any one of the\r\nseveral varieties offered for sale. It is always best to state the\r\nspecific kind of seed ordered and then submit a sample to either your\r\nState Agricultural experiment Station or one of the seed laboratories\r\nof the United States Department of Agriculture[8] for identification\r\nbefore purchasing.\r\n\r\n[8] Samples of seed may be submitted for analysis or identification to\r\nthe Seed Laboratory of the United States Department of Agriculture at\r\nWashington, D. C., or to any of the following laboratories maintained\r\nthrough the cooperation of the Department: Branch Seed-Testing\r\nLaboratory, Agricultural Experiment Station, Columbia, Mo.; Branch\r\nSeed-Testing Laboratory, Agricultural Experiment Station, Baton Rouge,\r\nla.; Branch Seed-Testing Laboratory, Oregon Agricultural College,\r\nCorvallis, Oreg.; Branch Seed-Testing Laboratory, Purdue University, La\r\nFayette, Ind.; Branch Seed-Testing Laboratory, California Agricultural\r\nStation, Berkeley, Cal.\r\n\r\nThe Seed Laboratory of the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nduring the winter of 1915-16 obtained 172 trade samples of sweet-clover\r\nseed and, as may be seen from Table II, many of the samples were not\r\ntrue to name.\r\n\r\nTable II.--_Trade samples received in response to requests for\r\nwhite sweet clover seed._\r\n\r\n  Key to Columns\r\n    [A] White sweet clover.\r\n    [B] Biennial yellow sweet clover.\r\n    [C] White and biennial yellow sweet clover.\r\n    [D] Annual yellow sweet clover.\r\n\r\n                           Number of    Seed when tested\r\n  Seed labeled--            samples.      found to be--    Alfalfa and--\r\n                                       [A]  [B]  [C]  [D]  [A]  [B]  [C]\r\n  White flowering sweet\r\n    clover, white sweet\r\n    clover, or Holhara\r\n    clover, or _Melilotus\r\n    alba_.                     147     91   10   28   --    13    1    4\r\n  Sweet clover                  22      6    4    2    5     5   --   --\r\n    Not labeled                  3      1   --   --    2    --   --   --\r\n                              ----   ---- ---- ---- ----  ---- ---- ----\r\n      Total                    172     98   14   30    7    18    1    4\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF THE SEED BED.\r\n\r\nSweet clover requires a well-settled and firm seed bed, with just\r\nsufficient loose soil on the surface to permit the seed to be well\r\ncovered. When the seed is sown in the spring on winter grain the\r\nseed bed usually is in good condition. At this season of the year the\r\nseed may be sown, so that it will be covered by freezing and thawing\r\nweather. It may be sown also when the ground is in condition to\r\ncultivate and then may be harrowed or drilled in. When the seed is sown\r\nwith spring grain the seed bed is not as firm as it should be for the\r\nprompt germination and establishment of the young clover plants. If\r\nsown in this manner the soil should be worked into a fine condition and\r\nfirmed as much as possible. It is good practice to roll the ground with\r\na corrugated roller after seeding. Better stands are usually obtained\r\nby seeding on fields that have been disked and harrowed than on those\r\nthat have been plowed.\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover is seeded without a nurse crop it should not be sown\r\non freshly plowed land which has had no opportunity to settle. The land\r\npreferably should be plowed several months before the seed is to be\r\nsown, and then worked at intervals with soil packers or harrows. Double\r\ndisking and harrowing just previous to seeding are to be strongly\r\nrecommended in preference to plowing at this time.\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover is to be seeded in the fall on grain stubble, the\r\nground should be disked and worked into good condition as soon as the\r\ngrain can be removed. If the seed is sown immediately the field should\r\nbe rolled after seeding.\r\n\r\nFall-plowed ground ordinarily makes an ideal seed bed for spring\r\nseeding. Soil which has been previously planted to a cultivated crop,\r\nsuch as corn, is usually put in sufficiently good condition for\r\nsweet clover by disking. Good success has been attained by merely\r\nbroadcasting the seed on sandy soil and scratching it in with a harrow.\r\nSuch a seed bed appears to be ideal when the seed can be covered\r\nsufficiently to insure plenty of moisture. It must be remembered that\r\nyoung sweet-clover plants are not drought resistant and that every\r\nprecaution should be taken in seasons of drought or on laud which\r\ndrought affects badly to so prepare the seed bed that the largest\r\nquantity of moisture will be conserved.\r\n\r\nExcellent stands have been obtained at times by double-disking native\r\nprairie sod and either covering the seed with a harrow or sowing it\r\nwith a drill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper time to seed sweet clover should be determined by the\r\ngermination of the seed, the climatic conditions of the region, and\r\nthe condition of the seed bed at the time of sowing. When growing\r\nunder natural conditions, seed which has lain in the ground over\r\nwinter germinates in sufficient quantity during the following spring\r\nto produce a stand. It is therefore assumed that since this seed has\r\npassed the winter on or in the ground and has produced a good stand\r\nthe following spring, sweet clover may be sown at any time of the year\r\nand a satisfactory stand obtained. Little is thought of the enormous\r\nnumber of seeds which shatter from a single plant and fall on an area\r\nnot exceeding 5 or 6 feet in diameter. Single plants have produced as\r\nmany as 350,000 seeds (the approximate number in 1½ pounds), or about\r\n10,000 seeds for each square foot of ground covered. It matters little\r\nhow many of these seeds germinate in the fall they mature or during the\r\nfollowing winter, when the seedlings will be killed by freezing, for\r\nthere will be enough viable seeds left in the ground to germinate when\r\nconditions are favorable in the spring. Conditions are very different\r\nwhen sweet clover is sown on cultivated soil at the rate of 5 to 20\r\npounds of seed to the acre--25 to 100 seeds to the square foot. When\r\nthis quantity is sown, it is necessary that it be planted at such a\r\ntime that the greatest number of seeds will germinate and produce\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\nHULLED SWEET-CLOVER SEED.\r\n\r\nHulled seed makes up a large percentage of the sweet-clover seed sown.\r\nThe germination of hulled seed varies considerably, although ordinarily\r\nit is higher than that of unhulled seed. Seeding experiments conducted\r\nat Arlington, Va., with seed which germinated 80 per cent show clearly\r\nthat seed which germinates well should not be sown during the winter\r\nmonths in those sections of the country where midwinter thaws are\r\nlikely to occur, and especially in sections south of the latitude of\r\nsouthern Ohio. In these experiments seed was sown during each month\r\nof the winter. Good stands were obtained only on those plats which\r\nwere sown in the latter part of February and during March and April.\r\nAt least 75 per cent of the seed sown during November, December, and\r\nJanuary germinated on warm days during winter thaws and was killed\r\nby later cold weather. Notwithstanding the fact that sweet-clover\r\nseedlings will endure fairly low temperatures, seed germinating more\r\nthan 50 per cent should not be sown during the winter months, and\r\npreferably not more than a week previous to the average date for the\r\nlast severe freeze.\r\n\r\nNo data have been secured on winter seeding in those portions of the\r\nUnited States where open winters do not occur. It is probable that in\r\nthose sections the winters are sufficiently cold to prevent germination\r\nbefore spring. Good results may be obtained by winter seeding, but as\r\nusually no trouble is experienced in those sections in obtaining a\r\nstand by seeding as soon as the soil can be worked in the spring, it\r\nis strongly recommended that seeding be done with hulled seed, which\r\ngerminates well at this time of the year.\r\n\r\nMany excellent stands have been obtained by seeding late in the spring,\r\nbut in most sections seeding at this time is not as certain to produce\r\na good stand as earlier seeding. Late spring seeding may be preferable\r\nwhen the ground is weedy and the clover is to be seeded without nurse\r\ncrop. Under these circumstances a crop of weeds may be destroyed before\r\nseeding.\r\n\r\nVery good success has been obtained in the Southern and Central States,\r\nand in some of the Northern States, by seeding sweet clover in the\r\nlate summer or early autumn. When there is sufficient moisture in the\r\nsoil for germination and when good seed is used, better stands have\r\nbeen obtained by seeding about eight weeks before severe frosts are\r\nto be expected than from spring sowing. This is particularly true in\r\nregions where late spring droughts or severe summer droughts are likely\r\nto occur. Seeding at this time may be done after an early crop has\r\nbeen harvested and when weeds are not likely to be troublesome. Plants\r\nfrom fall seeding mature from 10 days to two weeks later the following\r\nseason than plants from spring sowing of the same year. The later time\r\nof maturing is an advantage, in that the plants will be ready to cut\r\nduring better haying weather. The root growth is not as large from fall\r\nseeding as from spring seeding, and therefore not quite as much humus\r\nis added to the soil. Late fall seedings are very likely to be injured\r\nfrom heaving on wet clay soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNHULLED SWEET-CLOVER SEED.\r\n\r\nUnhulled sweet-clover seed is sown principally in Kentucky, Alabama,\r\nand Mississippi. On the limestone soils of regions, which appear to be\r\nnaturally adapted to sweet clover, very good results are obtained by\r\nusing unhulled seed. It is not because southern-grown unhulled seed\r\ngerminates better than northern-grown unhulled seed that better stands\r\nare obtained in the South from it, but it is mainly because southern\r\nfarmers better understand the somewhat exacting conditions necessary\r\nfor obtaining a stand with this kind of seed. Unhulled sweet clover\r\ncontains a large percentage of hard seeds which will not germinate\r\nuntil they have been in the soil for some time and have been subjected\r\nto varying temperatures.\r\n\r\nSeeding experiments have been conducted at Arlington, Va., where\r\nunhulled seed which contained 90 per cent of hard seed was sown during\r\neach month of the winter. Good stands were obtained on those plats\r\nseeded at the rate of 24 pounds (3 pecks) of seed to the acre during\r\nDecember and January, and fair stands on the plats seeded at this rate\r\nin February. Later seedings failed to produce a stand.\r\n\r\nA large percentage of the unhulled seed sown in the South is seeded\r\nduring January and the first part of February. Good stands are seldom\r\nobtained from unhulled seed south of the latitude of Washington, D. C.,\r\nwhen the seed is sown later than the middle of February.\r\n\r\nThe use of unhulled seed has usually been attended with failure in\r\nthe northern portion of the United States, although occasionally good\r\nstands have been obtained the following spring from late fall seeding.\r\nThis failure is in part due to the fact that the seed has been sown\r\nin the spring and at a tine when only seed germinating well should\r\nbe used. When unhulled seed is to be sown north of the latitude of\r\nWashington, D. C., it should be sown not later than February 15, and\r\npreferably earlier. Observations show that fairly good stands may be\r\nobtained by seeding during the winter, but care should be taken not to\r\nsow seed earlier than necessary on land which is subject to washing.\r\nFarmers should have no trouble in purchasing hulled seed, and therefore\r\nit is recommended that only hulled seed which germinates well be sown.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATE OF SEEDING.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which sweet clover should be seeded varies with the\r\ngermination of the seed, the condition of the seed bed, the climatic\r\nconditions of the region, and the method of seeding. Throughout the\r\nhumid sections of the eastern United States sweet clover ordinarily is\r\nseeded at the rate of 15 to 20 pounds of hulled seed to the acre. From\r\n12 to 15 pounds should be ample where the seed bed is in good condition\r\nand the seed germinates 75 per cent or more. In Illinois, the western\r\nNorth-Central States, the Mountain States, and the Pacific Coast States\r\ngood stands are generally obtained by sowing 10 to 12 pounds of hulled\r\nseed to the acre. In eastern Washington it is claimed that from 5 to 8\r\npounds to the acre are sufficient for good stands.\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover is grown under irrigation, 8 to 10 pounds of hulled\r\nseed usually are sufficient, and from 2 to 4 pounds per acre are enough\r\nwhen seeded in rows from 2 to 4 feet apart. Of unhulled seed 3 to 6\r\npecks (24 to 48 pounds) or 20 pounds of hulled seed are usually sown in\r\nthe South for pasturage or hay. In any region at least 10 pounds more\r\nof the unhulled than of hulled seed should be sown to an acre. Unless\r\nannual yellow sweet-clover seed is thoroughly cleaned it should be sown\r\nat the rate of 25 to 30 pounds to the acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF SEEDING.\r\n\r\nThe methods used for seeding red clover or alfalfa in any particular\r\nregion will be suitable for seeding sweet clover. Good results have\r\nbeen obtained by broadcasting the seed on winter grain in the spring\r\nwhen the ground is in a honeycombed condition. Perhaps a better method\r\nis to wait until the ground can be worked and then to broadcast and\r\ncover the seed with a harrow or to sow it with a drill. Unhulled seed\r\nis usually broadcasted, since it is necessary to sow it before the\r\nground is in condition to be worked. Unless the hulls have been rubbed\r\nsmooth, some difficulty may be experienced in seeding it evenly with a\r\ndrill.\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover is to be sown with spring-seeded grain or when it is\r\nto lie sown without a nurse crop it may be drilled in or sown broadcast\r\nand covered with a harrow. Better stands are generally obtained with a\r\nsmaller quantity of seed when it is sown with the drill than when it is\r\nbroadcasted on honeycombed ground. When the seed is sown at the time\r\nthe grain is planted, the grass-seeder attachment of the drill commonly\r\nis used. In some sections the end-gate seeder is used almost entirely.\r\nWhen the seed is sown by either of these methods it may be seeded alone\r\nor mixed with the grain. When only the clover seed is sown with a\r\ndrill, the alfalfa and clover seed drills are to be preferred.\r\n\r\nSweet-clover seed may be mixed with some inert substance of\r\napproximately the same size and weight and sown with an ordinary grain\r\ndrill. Finely cracked corn, cracked wheat, or coarse bran often are\r\nused for this purpose. When one portion of sweet clover is mixed with\r\ntwo portions of a filler find the drill is set to sow one-half bushel\r\nof wheat, it will usually sow from 15 to 20 pounds of sweet clover\r\nto the acre. As this quantity will vary with the different types of\r\ndrills, it is necessary to test each drill, so that the seed may be\r\nmixed with the filler in such proportions that the desired quantity\r\nwill be sown. The drill may be tested by blocking it up, so that\r\nthe geared wheel is off the ground, and this wheel may be turned a\r\nsufficient number of times to establish a definite portion of an acre.\r\nThe seed that runs through can then be weighed and the rate per acre\r\ndetermined. The rate may be determined more accurately by plugging up\r\nthe grain tubes or by tying a small sack on each tube and pulling the\r\ndrill for a specific distance over the field to be sown. The jar of the\r\ndrill will cause it to drop more seed than when it is blocked up and\r\nrun by hand.\r\n\r\nIt is often desired to seed sweet clover on land which can not be\r\ncultivated. When sown on such land it is recommended that unhulled\r\nseed or seed that contains a large percentage of hard seed be used and\r\nthat it be broadcasted during the winter. The subsequent freezing and\r\nthawing will cover many of the seeds and cause them to germinate. It\r\nis a good plan to scatter in deep gulleys mature plants that have not\r\nshattered all their seed. The branches of these plants will help to\r\nhold the seed in place until it germinates and the young plants become\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nSeed may be scattered on native prairie ground in the late winter, but\r\nunless it is trampled into the ground by live stock disappointing\r\nresults are likely to be obtained at first. Fair results have been\r\nsecured by planting seed with disk drills on prairie sod after it had\r\nbeen double-disked in the early spring. This method should be used in\r\npreference to broadcasting the seed and depending on cattle to trample\r\nit in. Mr. George Hummer, of Prairie Point, Miss., reports good success\r\nin his locality by simply broadcasting 1 peck of unhulled seed on\r\nBermuda-grass sod not later than January 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINOCULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcepting soil acidity, lack of inoculation probably is responsible\r\nfor more failures with sweet clover than any other one cause. When\r\nsweet-clover plants are not inoculated they must depend upon the\r\navailable nitrogen in the soil for their supply, and as the crop is\r\ngrown for the most part on soils low in nitrogen the plants can not be\r\nexpected to make more than a small growth. (Fig. 9.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--White sweet clover at Arlington, Va., showing\r\nthe effect of inoculation upon their growth. The plants at the left\r\nrepresent the average growth on the inoculated plats; those at the\r\nright the average growth on the plats not inoculated. The plats had\r\nbeen previously limed and were seeded on the same date.]\r\n\r\nArny and Thatcher, at the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station,\r\nobtained 10 times as much dry matter in the tops and seven times as\r\nmuch in the roots of sweet-clover plants which had been grown on\r\nthoroughly inoculated soil as from plants Which had been grown on soil\r\nnot inoculated. Moreover, the plants grown on the inoculated soil\r\ncontained 117 pounds more nitrogen to the acre than those grown on the\r\nuninoculated soil.\r\n\r\nExperiments in many other sections of the country, and especially in\r\nthe northeastern quarter of the United States, where but little sweet\r\nclover or alfalfa has thus far been grown, show that inoculation\r\nis very essential to success. Ordinarily it is not necessary to\r\ninoculate sweet clover when it is to be planted on land where alfalfa,\r\nbur-clover, or black medic thrives, because the same strain of\r\ninoculating germs inoculates all of these plants. However, when this\r\ncloser is to be planted on land where none of the plants inoculated\r\nby this strain of the organism have been grown, inoculation should be\r\nprovided. In localities where sweet clover or other plants inoculated\r\nby the same strain of bacteria thrive, the early growth has at times\r\nbeen made much more vigorous by inoculating the soil or seed thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIt is not safe to assume that a certain piece of soil is inoculated\r\nbecause any one of the plants inoculated by the same strain of the\r\norganism is growing or has been grown on other fields in the same\r\nvicinity. Many fields have come under observation where sweet clover\r\nwas a failure because the plants were not inoculated, when plats or\r\nfields of alfalfa growing near by were abundantly inoculated.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of inoculating sweet clover, any one of which\r\nwhen properly applied should give good results.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL-TRANSFER METHOD.\r\n\r\nThe soil-transfer method of inoculation consists in scattering over the\r\nfield to be seeded 200 to 400 pounds to the acre of soil collected from\r\nsweet-clover, alfalfa, or bur-clover fields where the healthy plants\r\nshow an abundance of tubercles on the roots. It is strongly recommended\r\nthat this soil be scattered on a cloudy day or in the early morning or\r\nin the evening and immediately harrowed or disked into the ground, as\r\nthe sun's rays are very injurious to the inoculating germs. It is a\r\ngood plan for the person scattering the soil to walk directly in front\r\nof the harrow. When this practice is followed little harm can be done\r\nby the light. To facilitate even scattering, the soil may be mixed\r\nthoroughly with two or three times its weight of other soil, preferably\r\nfrom the field where the sweet clover is to be sown. Soil used for\r\ninoculating sweet clover does not necessarily have to be scattered\r\non the land just previous to sowing the seed. It may be scattered a\r\nfew months or a year in advance of the time the sweet clover is to be\r\nseeded and be just as effective as if it were scattered at a later\r\ntime. In general, where sweet clover is to be seeded in the spring on\r\nwinter grain, the inoculation should be applied before the grain is\r\nsown.\r\n\r\nGood success has been obtained by drying in a dark place soil\r\ncontaining the inoculating germs, sifting it, and running it through\r\nthe fertilizer compartment of a grain drill. When this method is\r\nemployed it is not necessary to use as much soil as when it is\r\nscattered broadcast.\r\n\r\nA comparatively new method which has given successful results calls\r\nfor dampening each bushel of seed and spreading it on a cloth, paper,\r\nor cement floor, where half a gallon of throughly inoculated soil from\r\nsweet-clover or alfalfa plants may be sifted over it. Some people\r\nprefer to add a trace of glue or sugar to water, so that more of the\r\nsoil will adhere to the seed, although some soil will remain on the\r\nseed if the glue or sugar is not used. When only this quantity of soil\r\nis used it should be collected from around the roots of sweet-clover\r\nplants which are abundantly inoculated. Such soil may be collected\r\nin the fall and kept until spring in a cool, dry, dark place with\r\nno injury to the inoculating organisms. Seed treated in this manner\r\nshould be kept in the dark and should be sown as soon as possible after\r\ntreating.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PURE-CULTURE METHOD.\r\n\r\nThe pure-culture method has the advantage of greater case of\r\ntransportation and freedom from danger of introducing harmful pests\r\nupon the farm. Inoculation by pure cultures may be carried out in\r\neither of two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) A bottle of pure culture of the proper kind of bacteria is opened\r\nand the culture mixed with a convenient quantity of water; this diluted\r\nculture now is mixed thoroughly with a considerable quantity of soil,\r\npreferably from the field where the legume is to be sown; the treated\r\nsoil is then distributed in the same manner as when inoculation is made\r\nby the soil-transfer method.\r\n\r\n(2) A pure culture of the proper kind of bacteria should be applied\r\nto the seeds in such a way that they will all be moistened. The seed\r\nshould then be permitted to dry in a shady or dark place and should be\r\nplanted as soon as possible after it is dry. Drying may be facilitated\r\nby adding dry, sifted soil, preferably from the field where the seed is\r\nto be sown. Inoculating organisms very often die within a week after\r\nthe seed is inoculated. It is highly desirable, therefore that the\r\ninoculation be made the day the seed is sown. Inoculated seed never\r\nshould be dried in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked whether it is advisable to inoculate seed\r\nwith pure-culture method and sow it on honeycombed ground in the\r\nspring. No experiments have thus far been completed to determine the\r\nadvisability of this procedure. Some inoculation would probably result\r\nfrom this practice, because the bacteria on that portion of the seed\r\nnext to the ground would be protected from the sunlight and would in\r\na short time under ordinary conditions be covered by the freezing and\r\nthawing of the soil. While it is hardly possible to obtain as complete\r\ninoculation by this practice as by other methods, it is to be preferred\r\nto no inoculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE STAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner in which a stand of sweet clover is handled should depend\r\nsomewhat upon the method and date of seeding and the purpose for which\r\nit is sown. Climatic conditions should also be taken into consideration\r\nand the handling of the crop governed accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT THE FIRST SEASON.\r\n\r\nThe most serious objection to seeding sweet clover in the spring\r\nwithout a nurse crop is weeds. In many sections of the country seeds\r\nwill take as much water from the soil and make as much or more shade\r\nthan a crop of grain. In spite of the fact that sweet clover will\r\nwithstand more adverse conditions than red clover or alfalfa, a heavy\r\ngrowth of weeds will greatly retard the growth of the plants and in\r\nsome cases kill most of them. (Fig. 10.) On plats sown in April without\r\na nurse crop at Arlington, Va., it was necessary to mow weeds five\r\ntimes during the summer of 1915 in order to keep them partly checked.\r\nWhere it is necessary to mow a field so many times the plants are not\r\nonly checked or killed, but as much time is required for this work as\r\nwould be necessary to harvest a crop of grain. This trouble may be\r\novercome in part by pasturing the sweet clover the first season, but\r\neven then during wet weather it may be necessary to cut the weeds at\r\nleast once before the plants become well enough established to turn\r\nlive stock on the field. The plants should at no time be clipped closer\r\nthan 5 inches from the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter a field of sweet clover has become well established, it may\r\nbe pastured throughout the summer and fall. Close grazing should be\r\navoided during the summer, or the plants may be killed, but they may\r\nbe pastured fairly close to the ground in the autumn, as it does not\r\nappear as necessary to provide a winter covering as is the case with\r\nred clover. Close pasturing or clipping late in the fall has had a\r\nmarked effect on the growth of the plants the following spring on some\r\nfields and no apparent effect on the stand and growth of the plants\r\non other fields. A portion of a field in Livingston County, Ill., was\r\nclipped close to the ground in the late fall of 1915. On June 1, 1916,\r\nthe stand was somewhat heavier on the unclipped part of the field.\r\nMore noticeable than the thickness of the stand was the fact that the\r\nplants on the unclipped portion were 8 to 10 inches higher than those\r\non the clipped area. It is reasonable to believe that plants going into\r\nthe winter with no protection are more likely to be injured than those\r\nhaving some protection.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many fields in different parts of the country have\r\nbeen closely clipped or pastured in the late fall with no noticeable\r\ninjury. Because of the value of the hay or pasturage in the late summer\r\nand autumn of the year of seeding, it is strongly recommended that the\r\nfirst year's growth be utilized. If the field be cut for hay it is\r\nwell to leave a 4-inch or 5-inch stubble, as this will serve to catch\r\ndrifting snow during the winter, thereby adding to the protection\r\nagainst winterkilling. If the field is not pastured the first season\r\nand weeds are not troublesome, a cutting of hay may be made when growth\r\nceases in the fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--White sweet-clover plant (at the left),\r\nshowing the effect of a heavy growth of weeds. Had the weeds not been\r\npresent the plant at the left should have been larger than the one\r\nat the right, as the seed was sown two weeks earlier and the other\r\nconditions for growth were ideal. Four-fifths of the plants on the plat\r\nwhich had a heavy growth of weeds were entirely killed.]\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover is seeded with grain, moisture conditions should\r\nserve to determine whether the grain should be permitted to ripen or\r\nbe cut for hay. When untimely droughts appear the plants may be killed\r\nif the grain is not cut as early as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the South and in some sections of the Eastern and North-Central\r\nStates where the soil contains an abundance of limestone and is well\r\ninoculated, a cutting of hay may usually be obtained after a grain\r\ncrop has been harvested. In other sections of the North in only\r\nexceptionally favorable weather will more than pasturage be obtained\r\nafter the grain is cut.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT THE SECOND SEASON.\r\n\r\nOne of the special advantages of sweet clover is that it produces good\r\npasturage somewhat earlier in the spring than most forage crops. In\r\nthe North, with the exception of the extreme northern portion of the\r\nUnited States, it will furnish a cutting of hay in June or excellent\r\npasturage until that time and a crop of hay or seed in late summer. In\r\nthe South two cuttings of hay and a seed crop may be harvested. After\r\nmaturing seed the plants die. It is a common practice in many sections\r\nto pasture the crop until about June 10, when the stock is removed and\r\nthe plants are permitted to mature seed. If the plants have not been\r\ngrazed closely they should be clipped at this time, so that the seed\r\ncrop will ripen more evenly. Sweet clover may be pastured during the\r\nentire second season's growth, provided sufficient stock is kept on the\r\nfield to prevent the growth from becoming woody. If the plants become\r\ncoarse the pasture may be clipped, leaving an 8-inch stubble, so as to\r\ninduce a new growth which will be more palatable. If it is desired to\r\nhave the pasture reseed itself stock should be removed at least eight\r\nweeks before heavy frosts are expected, or only sufficient stock should\r\nbe permitted to remain on the pasture to keep some of the plants in\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER IN MIXTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery little sweet clover thus far has been grown in mixtures with other\r\ncrops. A few farmers have sown red clover and sweet clover together,\r\nbut such a mixture has no advantage over sweet clover seeded alone\r\nfor hay, as sweet clover should be cut at least two Weeks before the\r\nred clover is ready to harvest. Sweet clover is being seeded to some\r\nextent on native prairie sod in the Northwest, where it is claimed it\r\nadds greatly to the value of the native grasses for pasturage. A thin\r\nseeding of sweet clover is often desired in bluegrass pastures on this\r\naccount. One of the best pastures in eastern Iowa consists of a mixture\r\nof bluegrass, timothy, and sweet clover. The Mississippi Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station recommends a mixture of Johnson grass and sweet\r\nclover. In this mixture the first cutting will consist of almost pure\r\nsweet clover, while the second and third cutting's will be a mixture\r\nof those plants. A number of southern farmer have had good success in\r\nseeding sweet clover on Bermuda-grass sod.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station has obtained excellent\r\nresults from a mixture of Dwarf Essex rape and sweet clover, and also\r\nby the addition of soy beans to this mixture. It was found that by\r\nseeding 6 pounds of rape and 10 pounds of sweet clover per acre an\r\nabundance of nutritious pasturage was produced and that pigs preferred\r\nthis mixture to alfalfa. When soy beans were added it was seeded at\r\nthe rate of 1 bushel of soy beans, 6 pounds of Dwarf Essex rape, and\r\n18 pounds of sweet clover. The soy beans were drilled by themselves,\r\nand the rape and sweet clover were mixed and seeded with a press drill.\r\nBrood sows made a gain of from three-fourths to 1 pound a day during\r\nJuly on this mixture without additional feed and gave unusual evidence\r\nof thrift and vigor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--A cornfield, showing the effect of fall and\r\nspring plowing in killing sweet clover that had made but one year's\r\ngrowth. The portion of the field at the left was plowed in the autumn,\r\nwhile that at the right was plowed the following spring, after the\r\nplants had started growth. The corn is 4 inches high.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERADICATION OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome farmers hesitate to plant sweet clover on their farms for fear\r\nthey will have difficulty in eradicating it when the fields are planted\r\nto other crops. The results obtained annually by hundreds of farmers\r\nare sufficient proof that there is no foundation for such fear; in\r\nfact, farmers are experiencing much difficulty in cutting the first\r\ncrop the second season so high that the plants will not be killed. The\r\nnew crop of sweet clover, unlike that of red clover and alfalfa, must\r\ncome from the buds left on the stubble, so when the plants are cut\r\nbelow these buds they will be killed. As sweet clover is a biennial,\r\nthe plants die as soon as the seed crop is produced.\r\n\r\nWhen the first year's growth of sweet clover is to be turned under\r\nfor green-manure it is recommended that the field be plowed after the\r\nplants have made some growth the following spring rather than in the\r\nfall of the year of seeding. When the first year's growth is plowed\r\nunder the same fall many of the plants will not be entirely covered,\r\nand these will made a vigorous growth the following spring. When the\r\nplowing is delayed until the plants have made some growth the following\r\nspring no trouble will be experienced in eradicating them.
