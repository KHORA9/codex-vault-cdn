Here and there with the aid\r\nof capable guides a few have been introduced into the sphere of that\r\nwide and fascinating knowledge of Nature which has been so rapidly\r\naccumulated during this and the latter part of the last century. It is a\r\nfull treasure house constantly being enriched, but unfortunately the few\r\nwho have been initiated have soon acquired a technical language and\r\nhabit, so that their knowledge and new acquisitions are communicated to\r\nbut few. The public at large, not having the language nor an interpreter\r\nat hand, has come almost at once to a barrier which few have the time or\r\npatience to surmount.\r\n\r\nLatterly it has become clear that the largest progress cannot be made if\r\nthe knowledge of any branch of Science is confined to a few only. The\r\nmost rapid advances have been made where many men are interested and\r\nenthusiastic. In no science should there be a difficult barrier between\r\nthe amateur and the professional student. All Nature is equally open for\r\neveryone to study, and there should never be created obstacles as by the\r\nuse of terminology not easily acquired by anyone. Of late these barriers\r\nhave been in part broken down and competent students have written guides\r\nwhich anyone can follow, and soon begin to know the plants, trees,\r\nbirds, insects, etc. So far no one has attempted to make the study of\r\nminerals and rocks so direct and simple that everyone can get a start.\r\nMost books on minerals, and practically all those on rocks are written\r\nfor school courses, and to say the least chill any enthusiasm which is\r\nnaturally aroused by the finding of interesting looking rocks or\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this book is first of all to provide a means of\r\nidentifying minerals and rocks by such methods as are practical without\r\nelaborate equipment or previous training: and second to suggest the\r\nconditions under which the various minerals and rocks were formed, so\r\nthat, at the first contact, one may get a conception of the events which\r\nhave anteceded the mineral or rock which has been found. For this\r\npurpose keys have been worked out for determining the rocks and minerals\r\nby such obvious features as color, hardness, etc. Each mineral or rock\r\nis introduced by a summary of its characters, then the features by which\r\nit may be distinguished from any other similar mineral are given, after\r\nwhich its mode of origin and its meanings are considered. For those\r\ninterested in the composition of the minerals, it is given in chemical\r\nsymbols with each mineral. Most classifications of minerals are based on\r\nthe composition, all the sulphides, carbonates, etc., being grouped\r\ntogether, but in this book, because the popular interest and commercial\r\nuses are primarily in the metal present, the minerals are grouped in\r\neach case about the chief metal, all the minerals of iron being grouped\r\ntogether, for instance.\r\n\r\nA few minerals and rocks which are not strictly common have been\r\nincluded such as gems and meteorites; the gems because they are of\r\nintense interest to their owners and are often simply perfect examples\r\nof a fairly common mineral; and such forms as meteorites because it is\r\nimportant that, if one should run across one, it should be recognized,\r\nand so not lost to the world.\r\n\r\nThe book is freely illustrated, those minerals in which color is\r\nimportant for identification being illustrated in colors, and those\r\nwhich are black, or in which the color is not a determining factor, are\r\nshown in either photographic or outline figures.\r\n\r\nIn the introductory chapter there are explanations of the terms used in\r\ndescribing minerals, and of the systems in which they are grouped. A\r\nknowledge of the systems may not be a necessity, but it is a great help\r\nin determining minerals, and is very important in understanding why the\r\nindividual minerals take the varied forms which are characteristic of\r\nthem. These systems will be better understood after a few minerals have\r\nbeen gathered and examined.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped the book will help those who have already some knowledge of\r\nrocks and minerals, and especially that it will tempt many to begin an\r\nacquaintance with the rocks and minerals which are all about them, and\r\nare the foundation on which our material progress is built. Rocks and\r\nminerals have some advantages over most objects which are collected in\r\nthat they neither require special preparation before they can be kept,\r\nnor do they deteriorate with time.\r\n\r\nThe author will appreciate corrections or suggestions as to better\r\npresentation of the material in this book.\r\n\r\n                                                                F.

Because the whole\r\nworld is made of rocks and minerals. They are the foundations on which\r\nwe build. From them we draw all our metals, and the extent to which we\r\nutilize our minerals is a measure of the advance of our civilization.\r\nFragments of rock are the soil from which, by way of the plants, we draw\r\nour food, and ultimately our life. The rocks make wild or gentle\r\nscenery, one at least of the sources of pleasure. Knowledge of rocks and\r\nminerals is then knowledge of fundamentals, of ultimate sources. Between\r\nfinding the raw materials and their present uses there are usually many\r\nsteps (so many that we forget that the beginning and end are united), as\r\nfor instance in your watch. It is made of gold, brass, steel, agate,\r\nglass, and perhaps has luminous radium paint on the hands. It is a long\r\nway from finding and mining gold, chalcopyrite, hematite, carnotite,\r\netc., through the raw materials, gold, copper, iron, etc., to the\r\nfinished watch, but the minerals are the foundations of the watch; and\r\nit took centuries to find them and learn one by one how to use them,\r\nfrom the gold 10,000 years ago down to the radium within the last fifty\r\nyears. Then too there is joy in going out into Nature’s wild and raw\r\nplaces, joy in being on the foundations of the earth, joy in the\r\nscenery, in the beauty of the minerals themselves.\r\n\r\nBut why collect the rocks and minerals? First because this is the way to\r\nknow them. Both mineral and rocks require careful examination in order\r\nto see all those fine points by which they are distinguished. It is\r\noften necessary to compare one with another to get in mind the\r\ndifferences of form, color, streak, though with increasing familiarity\r\nthese characteristics are recognized at first sight. It is the repeated\r\nexamination which makes a rock tell the story of the country from which\r\nit came. Our first attempts to read the story give us only the most\r\ngeneral facts. Nature’s book, written in the rocks, has to be read\r\nclosely, often between the lines. Until we are used to the characters in\r\nwhich the words are written, we read slowly. When they look at Nature’s\r\nbook, always open, most people do not read; for they do not know their\r\nletters. Every mineral is a letter, every rock a word, and we learn to\r\nread as we learn the minerals and rocks, and every time we go over them\r\nwe get more facts coming out. The place where a rock or mineral occurs\r\nis of course the relation between them, and is involved in reading the\r\nstory. No one today is a perfect reader. We are all learning to see more\r\nin the rocks day by day. So it is important to have the rocks and\r\nminerals where they can be handled and repeatedly examined, where we can\r\nturn to them in our leisure moments. Don’t stop when you have learned\r\nthe name of a mineral or rock. You need more. See what it means.\r\nSecondly, minerals have beauties of form, color, and structure, and they\r\ndo not fade. They will be as perfect in ten years as when found. We are\r\nall naturally crows, and love to gather the objects which interest us.\r\nIt is not a bad habit, and only needs directing. Cultivate it. Have a\r\nhobby, and minerals and rocks are a good one; for they are like\r\ntreasures in Heaven which “neither moth nor rust doth corrupt.” Not only\r\nwill they give you pleasure, but they will be a constructive education,\r\ntraining the eye to see, and the mind to think straight. No one ever\r\nregretted the time and effort spent in collecting either minerals or\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCollecting\r\n\r\nIn order to make a collection valuable two or three rules must be\r\nobserved. In the case of rocks, collect large enough samples so that\r\nthey will be characteristic, and clear in their make-up. The standard\r\nsize for rocks is 3 × 4 inches on top and one to two inches thick\r\naccording to the nature of the rock. Tiny fragments do not give the\r\ncharacter of the rock as well, and they are all the time getting into\r\nconfusion. Every specimen should be labeled, with at least its name and\r\nthe exact locality from which it came. Composition, structural features,\r\nassociations, and classification may be added, the more the better; for\r\neach item adds to the information and interest of the specimen. One may\r\nmake his own labels or have printed blanks, and may put as much care and\r\nart into the labels as desired, the more the better. One thing is very\r\nimportant and that is to have a number on the label with a corresponding\r\none on the specimen, so that in case they should get separated, they may\r\nbe readily brought together, even by one who is not familiar with the\r\nindividual specimens. Lastly, give your collection as good a place as\r\npossible, either in drawers, boxes or in a case. The specimens are worth\r\nbeing kept in order and where they can be readily seen and compared.\r\nNature is systematic, and there is a reason for the order in which rocks\r\nand minerals are taken up. It is desirable either that this order, or\r\nsome one of the orders of Nature appear in the collection. In this book\r\nthe metals are the basis of classification, all those minerals primarily\r\nrelated to one of the metals being grouped together.\r\n\r\nIn collecting minerals, the size of the specimens can not be so\r\nregularly followed, but it should be followed when collecting\r\nnon-crystalline minerals, and when possible. Crystals however are chosen\r\nfrom a variety of points of view, as perfection of form, color, examples\r\nof cleavage, twinning, etc.; so that in many cases smaller or larger\r\nexamples must appear in the collection. It is always desirable that as\r\nmany variations of a rock or mineral as possible should appear in the\r\ncollection, and in many cases examples of the matrix from which the\r\ncrystals came. When crystals are tiny, it is well to place them in\r\nvials, that they may not be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere\r\n\r\nWhere shall we start in making a collection? Near home. Get the local\r\nminerals and rocks first, and then range as widely as possible. The best\r\nplaces are bare and exposed rocks, especially where fresh and\r\nun-weathered surfaces are available. Quarries and where there has been\r\nblasting along roads offer fine opportunities. Fissures and cavities in\r\nthe rocks are especially likely to have fine crystals, and in all\r\nlocalities continued search will reveal a surprising number of different\r\nminerals. The greatest variety occur in metamorphic rocks, or where\r\nigneous rocks come in contact with other rocks, but even the sedimentary\r\nrocks have a goodly range of minerals. All through the glaciated regions\r\nof the northern United States lie scattered boulders brought from afar,\r\nwhich will yield a surprising number of minerals and variety of rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nEquipment\r\n\r\nOne may start with a very simple equipment, a geologist’s or stone\r\nmason’s hammer which can be obtained at any hardware store, being\r\nsufficient for field work. Rocks should be broken, so as to show fresh\r\nsurfaces and to get below the disintegrating effects of weathering. At\r\nhome one should have a streak plate (a piece of unglazed porcelain), a\r\nset of hardness minerals (see page 20), and a small bottle each of\r\nhydrochloric and nitric acid. A pocket lens is useful in order to see\r\nmore clearly the form of small minerals. These things can be purchased\r\nof any Naturalist’s Supply Co., like Ward’s Natural Science\r\nEstablishment, P.O. 24, Beachwood Sta., Rochester, N. Y., or the\r\nKny-Scheerer Corp., 483 First Ave., New York City. Success depends upon\r\na quick eye, and persistent hunting. When traveling, opportunities are\r\noffered at frequent intervals to see and get new specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy Your Collection\r\n\r\nBe sure and see the meaning in each rock and mineral. The history of the\r\ncountry is revealed in its rocks and minerals. Note whether the rocks\r\nare horizontal or folded, whether they change character from place to\r\nplace, or vertically. In going over a piece of country you may locate an\r\nancient mountain system now leveled, by noting a series of metamorphic\r\nrocks, with a central core of granite, the roots of former mountains.\r\nDon’t be afraid to draw conclusions from what you see. Later, when the\r\nopportunity offers, look up the region in the geological folio,\r\nbulletin, or map of that section, and check up your findings. These\r\ngeological folios and bulletins, of which there is one for nearly every\r\nregion, are a great help to collectors in suggesting where to look for\r\nvarious rocks and minerals. Write to the Director of the U. S.\r\nGeological Survey, Washington, D. C., for a catalogue of the\r\npublications of the United States Survey, or find out from him what are\r\nthe maps or folios for the region in which you are interested. These U.\r\nS. publications cost but little. When opportunity presents itself, visit\r\nother collections. In them you will see some of the minerals or rocks\r\nwhich have puzzled you, and there is nothing quite so satisfactory as\r\nseeing the rocks or minerals themselves. No description can always be so\r\nconvincing. Then too you will get suggestions as to localities that you\r\ncan visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature\r\n\r\nAs your collection grows, if you find you have special interest in one\r\nor another branch of the field, you can get books giving more details in\r\nthat line; and at the back of this book will be found a list of such\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                ON THE FORMS AND PROPERTIES OF MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks\r\n\r\nAll we know of the earth by direct observation is confined to less than\r\nfour miles depth; though by projecting downward the layers of rock that\r\ncome to the surface, we may fairly assume a knowledge of the structure\r\ndown to six or eight miles depth. This outer portion is often referred\r\nto as the “crust of the earth,” but the idea that the deeper portions\r\nare molten is no longer held. This outer portion is made of rocks, and a\r\nrock may be defined as, _a mass of material, loose or solid, which makes\r\nup an integral part of the earth_, as granite, limestone, or sand. The\r\nrocks (except glassy igneous ones) are aggregates of one or more\r\nminerals; either in their original form like the quartz, feldspar and\r\nmica of granite, or in a secondary grouping, resulting from the units\r\nhaving been dislodged from their primary position and regrouped a second\r\ntime, as in sandstone or clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinerals\r\n\r\nSince the rocks are aggregates of minerals, it is best to take up the\r\nminerals first. A mineral may be defined as _a natural inorganic\r\nsubstance of definite chemical composition_. It is usually solid,\r\ngenerally has crystalline structure, and may or may not be bounded by\r\ncrystal faces. _A crystal is a mineral, bounded by symmetrically grouped\r\nfaces, which have definite relationships to a set of imaginary lines\r\ncalled axes._ There are between 1100 and 1200 minerals, of which 30 are\r\nso frequently present, and so dominant in making up the rocks, that they\r\nare termed _rock-forming minerals_. About 150 more occur frequently\r\nenough so that they can be termed common minerals, and one may expect to\r\nfind a fairly large proportion of them. Some of these are abundant in\r\none part of the country and rare in others, but this book is written to\r\ncover the United States, and so all those which have a fair abundance\r\nare included, though some will only be found in the west and others\r\nmostly in the east. Then there are some more minerals which are really\r\nrare, but which are cherished because of their beauty of color, and are\r\nused as gems. These are mentioned, and many of the gems are simply clear\r\nand beautiful examples of minerals, which in dark or cloudy forms are\r\nmuch more common. If one finds any of these rare minerals which are not\r\nmentioned in this book, he must turn to one of the larger mineralogies\r\nmentioned in the literature list to determine them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrystal Structure\r\n\r\nA crystal is a mass of molecules, all of the same composition. A\r\nmolecule in its turn is made up of atoms, and each atom is a unit mass\r\nof an element. Thus the calcite molecule is made up of one unit or atom\r\nof calcium, one of carbon, and three of oxygen (CaCO₃). These atoms are\r\nheld together by an attraction, and make a molecule, and for the study\r\nof minerals the molecule is the unit. The mineral, calcite, is a mass of\r\nmolecules all like the one above, and each molecule so small as to be\r\ninvisible even with the aid of the most powerful microscope. When\r\ncalcite is in crystal form, the molecules, like ranks of soldiers, are\r\narranged each in its place, each at a definite distance from the other.\r\nWhile each molecule may vibrate or wiggle within certain limits it does\r\nnot leave its place. (The comparison with soldiers is a good one for the\r\nmolecules of one layer, but it must be remembered that in a crystal\r\nthere are also like spacings and ranks up and down as well.) As long as\r\nthe molecules remain in fixed ranks, up and down, forward and back, and\r\nsideways, the crystal is perfect. Calcite may be heated until it melts\r\nand becomes liquid. Then the molecules leave their definite arrangement\r\nand move about in all sorts of directions, like the soldiers after ranks\r\nhave broken. So long as the molecules are thus free to move about but\r\nkeep together, the substance is a liquid. There are cases when the\r\nmolecules in this disorder take fixed positions without falling into\r\nranks. Such minerals are non-crystalline and usually appear glassy. If\r\nstill greater heat is applied to the mineral in liquid form, a point is\r\nreached (the vapor point), above which the molecules go flying away from\r\neach (like soldiers in a panic), each seeking to get as far from the\r\nother as possible, so only a container will prevent their dissipation.\r\nWhen in this condition a mineral is gaseous. When cooled, the reverse\r\norder obtains. The molecules of gas gather into a miscellaneous mob or\r\nliquid: and if this is further cooled (but not too suddenly), they fall\r\ninto ranks and make a crystal. This may be illustrated with water. When\r\nabove 212° F. it is steam (molecules wildly dissipated); when between\r\n212° and 32° it is water (molecules close to each other, but milling\r\nlike a herd of cattle); and when below 32° it is ice, the molecules\r\nranged in perfect order, rank on rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrystal Systems\r\n\r\nWith all the possible forms that crystals can and do take, there are six\r\nsystems of arrangement. First there is the case where ranks, files, and\r\nvertical rows are all equal, and now to be scientific, instead of\r\ntalking about ranks, files, etc., we use the term axes to express these\r\nideas; the files or arrangements from front to back, being called the _a\r\naxis_, the ranks, or side to side arrangement the _b axis_, and the\r\nvertical arrangement the _c axis_. (See Plate 1.) These axes are\r\nimaginary lines, but they represent real forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsometric system\r\n\r\nWhen the axes are all equal and at right angles to each other, a crystal\r\nis said to be in the isometric system. The cube is the basal form and\r\neach side is known as a face. The ends of the axes come to the middle of\r\nthe cube faces. The essential feature of this system is that whatever\r\nhappens to one axis must happen to all, which is another way of saying\r\nthat all the axes are equal. If we think of the cube as having the\r\ncorners cut off, we would have a new face on each of the eight corners,\r\nin addition to the six cube faces. Then if each of these new faces were\r\nenlarged until they met and obliterated the cube faces, an eight-sided\r\nfigure, the octahedron, would result. In this the axes would ran to the\r\ncorners. Another modification of the cube would be to bevel each of its\r\ntwelve edges, making twelve new faces in addition to the six cube faces.\r\nIf we think of these new faces being developed until they meet and\r\nobliterate the cube faces, there will result a twelve-sided figure, the\r\ndodecahedron. And the 24 edges of the dodecahedron could be beveled to\r\nmake a 24-sided figure, and so on. Of course in Nature the corners are\r\nnot cut, nor the edges beveled, but as a result of the interaction of\r\nthe forces expressed by the axes and the distribution of the molecules,\r\nthe molecules arrange themselves in a cube, octahedron, dodecahedron or\r\ncombination of these basal forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrystal formation\r\n\r\nCrystals are formed in liquids as they cool or evaporate and can no\r\nlonger hold the minerals in solution. Crystals start about a center or\r\nnucleus, and molecule by molecule, the orderly arrangement is increased\r\nand the crystal grows, there being no size which is characteristic. If\r\nfree in the liquid the crystal grows perfectly on all sides, but if\r\ncrystals are growing side by side, there comes a time when they\r\ninterfere with each other. Then the free faces continue to grow and the\r\norderly internal arrangement is maintained, though externally there is\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n\r\nTetragonal system\r\n\r\nIn the second or tetragonal system one axis (the c axis) is different\r\nfrom the other two, but all three are still at right angles with each\r\nother. This is saying scientifically that the lines of force are greater\r\nor less in one direction than in the other two, but they act at right\r\nangles to each other. The a and the b axes are equal and anything that\r\nhappens to one of these two must happen to the other, but need not\r\nhappen to the c axis. Thinking of the molecules that arrange themselves\r\nunder this system of forces, it is clear that the simplest form will be\r\na square prism, _i.e._, front to back, and from side to side the numbers\r\nof molecules will be equal, but up and down there will be a greater or\r\nlesser number. If the eight corners of this prism were cut, and these\r\ncorner faces increased in size until they met, the resulting octahedron\r\nwould be longer (or shorter) from top to bottom than from side to side\r\nor front to back, but the measurement from front to back would be equal\r\nto the one from side to side. In this system we may have the vertical\r\nedges of the prism beveled, and not have to bevel the horizontal ones,\r\nor we may bevel the horizontal edges and not the vertical ones. There is\r\nno dodecahedron in this system or in any other system than the\r\nisometric. The forms in this tetrahedral system are really a combination\r\nof the four sides of the square prism with such modifications as equally\r\naffect them all, with two ends which may be flat, or pyramidal, or\r\nmodified pyramidal faces.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthorhombic system\r\n\r\nThe third system has all three axes unequal, but all three are still at\r\nright angles with each other. This is saying that the lines of force in\r\nthe crystals are all at right angles to each other but of unequal value.\r\nThe faces in this case are all in pairs. What happens at one end of an\r\naxis must happen at the opposite end, but does not need to happen at the\r\nends of any of the other axes. We are dealing with pairs of faces (one\r\nat either end of an axis), and if three such pairs are combined in the\r\nsimplest manner, the resulting figure will be a rectangular prism. If we\r\ncut the eight corners of this prism and enlarge the faces until they\r\nmeet, the result is an octahedron, in which the distance from top to\r\nbottom, from side to side, or from front to back is not the same in any\r\ntwo cases. (See Plate 2.) In this system if a face is made by beveling\r\none edge of the prism there must be a corresponding face on the edge\r\ndiagonally opposite, but there does not have to be one on any of the\r\nother edges. However if a corner is cut, that face affects all the axes\r\nand so all the corners must be cut. A great many crystals occur in this\r\nsystem, and some of them which are prismatic in shape may give trouble,\r\nfor it is not uncommon for the vertical edges of the prism to be so\r\nbeveled, that two of the original prism faces are obliterated, and the\r\ntwo remaining faces added to the four new faces make a six-sided prism,\r\nwhich at first glance seems to belong to the hexagonal system. (See\r\nPlate 3, fig. 3.) Close examination however will show that, instead of\r\nall the prism faces being alike, as would be necessary for the hexagonal\r\nsystem, they are really in pairs, and one pair at least will be\r\ndistinguished in some way, such as being striated, pitted, or duller.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonoclinic system\r\n\r\nThe fourth system has all the axes unequal, the a axis and the b axis at\r\nright angles to each other, but the c axis is inclined to the a axis,\r\nmeeting it at some other than a right angle. The monoclinic system is\r\nlike the orthorhombic system except that it leans, or is askew, in one\r\ndirection. The result is that the faces at the ends of the b axis are\r\nrhombohedral, while the others are rectangular. As in the foregoing\r\nsystem, the faces are in pairs at opposite ends of the axes; and as in\r\nthe orthorhombic system, a face may occur on one edge and only have to\r\nbe repeated on the edge diagonally opposite. The simplest form in this\r\nsystem will be made by combining the three pairs of faces at the\r\nopposite ends of the axes, which gives a prism, which is rectangular in\r\ncross section, but leans backward (or forward) if placed on end. As in\r\nall the systems, if a corner is cut, all must be cut; and if these\r\ncorner faces are extended to meet each other, an octahedron results, in\r\nwhich, as in the prism, no two axes are equal. If this octahedron is\r\nproperly orientated (_i.e._ with the a and b axes horizontal), it will\r\nlean forward or backward. Many minerals belong to this system; and, as\r\nin the orthorhombic system, it is not uncommon to have the vertical\r\nedges so beveled that two of the prism faces are obliterated, and the\r\nremaining two prism faces with the four new faces make a six-sided\r\nprism, which seems hexagonal. (See plate 3, figure 3.) However, such a\r\npseudo-hexagonal prism may be recognized by at least one pair of the\r\nfaces having distinguishing marks (striæ, pits, or dullness), instead of\r\nall being just alike.\r\n\r\n\r\nTriclinic system\r\n\r\nThe fifth or triclinic system has all the axes unequal, and no two of\r\nthem intersect at right angles. As in the two preceding systems the\r\nfaces occur in pairs at the opposite ends of the axes. This is the most\r\ndifficult system in which to orientate a crystal, but fortunately only a\r\nfew crystals occur in this system, such as the feldspars.\r\n\r\n\r\nHexagonal system\r\n\r\nLastly there is a group of crystals which have four axes, one vertical,\r\nand three in the horizontal plane which intersect each other at angles\r\nof 60°, all these three being equal to each other, but different from\r\nthe vertical axis. The simplest form in this system is the six-sided\r\nprism. If one corner of this prism is cut all must be, and if these\r\ncorner faces are extended to meet each other, a double-six-sided pyramid\r\nresults. In this system if one of the vertical edges of the prism is\r\nbeveled, all must be, but the horizontal edges need not be; or the\r\nhorizontal edges may be beveled and the vertical ones not. The ends as\r\nthey are related to the c axis may be developed independently of the\r\nprism, and so the prism may be simply truncated by a flat end, or have\r\npyramids on either end.\r\n\r\n\r\nHemihedral forms\r\n\r\nIn this system it is quite common to have forms which result from the\r\ndevelopment of each alternate face of either the prism or the double\r\npyramid. In the case of the prism, if every alternate face is developed\r\n(and the others omitted) a three-sided prism results, as in tourmaline.\r\nIn the case of the double pyramid if the three alternate faces above are\r\nunited with the three alternate faces below, a six-sided figure is\r\nformed, which is known as the rhombohedron, as all the faces are\r\nrhombohedral in out-line and all equal. These forms in which only half\r\nthe faces are developed are known as hemihedral forms. The same sort of\r\nthing may happen in the isometric system in the case of the octahedron,\r\nand also in the case of the octahedron of other systems. When half the\r\nfaces of the octahedron are developed, two above unite with two below\r\nand make a four-sided figure, known as a tetrahedron. (See plate 10.)\r\nWhile tetrahedrons may occur in any of the first five systems they are\r\nnot common outside the isometric system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwinning\r\n\r\nAnother modification of the simple forms which will be met occasionally\r\nis twinning. By this is meant two crystals growing together as though\r\nplaced side by side on some one of the faces, and then revolved until\r\nthe two axes which would normally be parallel are at some definite angle\r\nwith each other, 60°, or 180° which is commoner. The surface of contact\r\nbetween the two crystals is called the _composition face_, and as no\r\nmore material can be added on that face the crystals continue to grow\r\ndeveloping the other faces, and we find faces in contact with each other\r\nwhich should be at the opposite end or other side of the crystals. This\r\ncontact of faces which should not come in contact, and the presence of\r\nreentrant angles are indications of twinning. In some minerals the\r\ntwinning may be repeated time and again, and if the twinning is on one\r\nof the end faces a branching structure results, as in frost and snow\r\ncrystals, or the multiple twinning may be of crystals growing side by\r\nside when the final form will approximate a series of thin sheets placed\r\nside by side as in some feldspars. The peculiar forms characteristic of\r\nindividual minerals are taken up under the respective minerals.\r\n\r\nOther important properties of minerals are hardness, cleavage, specific\r\ngravity, streak, luster, and color.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardness\r\n\r\nHardness may be defined as the mineral’s resistance to abrasion or\r\nscratching. It is measured by comparing a mineral with Moh’s scale, a\r\nset of ten minerals arranged in the order of increasing hardness, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1 talc\r\n  2 gypsum\r\n  3 calcite\r\n  4 fluorite\r\n  5 apatite\r\n  6 feldspar\r\n  7 quartz\r\n  8 topaz\r\n  9 corundum\r\n  10 diamond\r\n\r\nA set for measuring hardness may be purchased from any dealer in mineral\r\nsupplies. For rough determination, as in the field, the following\r\nobjects have the hardness indicated; the finger nail 2¼, a penny 3, a\r\nknife blade about 5.5, and glass not over 6. In testing, a mineral is\r\nharder than the one it will scratch, and softer than the one by which it\r\nis scratched. For instance, if a mineral will scratch calcite and is\r\nscratched by fluorite, it is between 3 and 4 in hardness, say 3.5. When\r\ntwo samples mutually scratch each other they are of equal hardness. Care\r\nmust be used in determining hardness, especially with the harder\r\nminerals; for often, when testing a mineral, the softer one will leave a\r\nstreak of powder on the harder one, which is not a scratch. One should\r\nalways rub the mark to make sure it is really a groove made by\r\nscratching.\r\n\r\n\r\nCleavage\r\n\r\nCleavage is the tendency, characteristic of most minerals, and due to\r\nthe arrangement of their molecules, to cleave or break along definite\r\nplanes. The cleavage of any mineral is not irregular or indefinite, but\r\ncharacteristic for each mineral, and always parallel to possible or\r\nactual faces on the crystal, and always so described. For instance\r\ngalena has three cleavages, all equally good, and parallel to the cube\r\nfaces; so it is said to have cubic cleavage. In the same way fluorite\r\nhas octahedral cleavage, and calcite rhombic cleavage. In some minerals\r\ncleavage is well developed in one plane, and less developed in other\r\nplanes, or it may be lacking altogether. The varying degrees of\r\nperfection by which a mineral cleaves are expressed as, perfect or\r\nimperfect, distinct or indistinct, good or poor, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of a mineral is its weight compared with the weight\r\nof an equal volume of water, and is therefore the expression of how many\r\ntimes as heavy as water the mineral is. For instance the specific\r\ngravity of pyrite is 5.1, which is saying it is 5.1 times as heavy as\r\nwater. In a pure mineral the specific gravity is constant, and an\r\nimportant factor in making final determinations. As ordinarily obtained,\r\na piece of pure mineral is weighed in air, which value may be called x.\r\nIt is then immersed in water and again weighed, and this value is called\r\ny. The difference between the weight in air and that in water is the\r\nweight of an equal volume of water. Then we have the following formula:\r\n\r\n                     specific gravity = (x)/(x-y).\r\n\r\nVarious balances have been devised for making these measurements, but\r\nany balance which will weigh small objects accurately, may be adapted to\r\nspecific gravity work, by hanging a small pan under the regular weighing\r\npan. When using this balance, care is taken to see that the lower pan is\r\nalways submerged in water, even while the mineral is being weighed in\r\nair, so that when weighed in water in the lower pan, the weight of this\r\nlower pan has already been considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nStreak\r\n\r\nBy streak is meant the color of the mineral when powdered. For some\r\nminerals, especially metallic ores, it is of great importance, for it\r\nremains constant, though the color of the surface of the mineral changes\r\nmaterially. It is most readily determined by rubbing a corner of the\r\nmineral on a piece of unglazed porcelain. Small plates, known as “streak\r\nplates” are made for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuster\r\n\r\nThe luster of a mineral is the appearance of its surface by reflected\r\nlight, and it is an important aid in determining many minerals. Two\r\ntypes of luster are recognized; metallic, the luster of metals, most\r\nsulphides and some oxides, all of which are opaque on their thin edges;\r\nand non-metallic, the luster of minerals which are more or less\r\ntransparent on their thin edges, and most of which are light colored.\r\nThe common non-metallic lusters are; vitreous, the luster of glass;\r\nresinous, the appearance of resin; greasy, oily appearance; pearly, the\r\nappearance of mother-of-pearl; silky, like silk due to the fibrous\r\nstructure; adamantine, brilliant like a diamond; and dull, as is chalk.\r\n\r\n\r\nColor\r\n\r\nWhen used with caution color is of the utmost importance in determining\r\nminerals, especially in making rapid determinations. In metallic\r\nminerals it is constant and dependable; but in the non-metallic minerals\r\nit may vary, due to the presence of small amounts of impurities which\r\nact as pigments. Color depends on chemical composition, and when not\r\ninfluenced by impurities is termed _natural_; but when the color is due\r\nto some inclosed impurity it is termed _exotic_. In this latter case\r\ncaution must be used in making determinations. Many minerals are\r\nprimarily colorless, but take on exotic colors as a result of the\r\npresence of small quantities of impurities; for instance, pure corundum\r\nis colorless, but with a trace of iron oxide present becomes red, and is\r\ncalled the ruby, or with a trace of cobalt becomes blue and is called\r\nsapphire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n

                       The Gold Group\r\n\r\nGold was undoubtedly the first metal to be used by primitive man; for,\r\noccurring as it did in the stream beds, its bright color quickly\r\nattracted the eye, and it was so soft, that it was easily worked into\r\nvarious shapes, which, because they did not tarnish, became permanent\r\nornaments. The metal is associated with the very earliest civilizations,\r\nbeing found in such ancient tombs as those at Kertsch in Crimea and in\r\nnorthern Africa and Asia Minor. It was used in the cloisonné work of\r\nEgypt 3000 years B.C. In America the Indians, especially to the south,\r\nwere using it long before the continent was discovered.\r\n\r\nOf all the metals gold is the most malleable, and its ductility is\r\nremarkable, for a piece of a grain’s weight (less than the size of a pin\r\nhead) can be drawn out into a wire 500 feet long; and it can be beaten\r\ninto a thin leaf as thin as ¹/₂₅₀₀₀₀ of an inch in thickness, and thus a\r\nbit, weighing only a grain, can thus be spread over 56 square inches.\r\n\r\nIt forms very few compounds, but has a considerable tendency to make\r\nalloys (_i.e._, mixtures with other metals without the resulting\r\ncompound losing its metallic character). In Nature gold is never\r\nentirely pure, but is an alloy, usually with silver, there being from a\r\nfraction of 1% up to 30% of the silver with the gold, the more silver in\r\nthe alloy, the paler the color of the gold. Australian gold is the\r\npurest, having but about .3% of silver in it, while Californian gold has\r\naround 10% and Hungarian gold runs as high as 30% of silver. Another\r\nalloy fairly abundant in Nature is that with tellurium, such as\r\n_calaverite_ (AuTe₂) which is a pale brassy yellow, similar to pyrite,\r\nbut with the hardness of but 2.5. Another combination includes gold,\r\nsilver and tellurium, _sylvanite_, (AuAgTe₄) a silvery white mineral\r\nwith a hardness of but 2. Such combinations are known as tellurides and\r\nthe calaverite is mined as a source of gold at Cripple Creek, Colo.,\r\nwhile the sylvanite is one of the important ores of gold in South\r\nAfrica. Occasionally gold is also found alloyed with platinum, copper,\r\niron, etc. Jewelers make several alloys, “red gold” being 3 parts gold\r\nand 1 of copper, “green gold” being the same proportions of gold and\r\nsilver, and “blue gold” being the combination of gold and iron. Our gold\r\ncoins are alloys, nine parts gold and one of copper, to give them\r\ngreater durability. Most of the gold recovered from nature is found\r\nnative, _i.e._, the pure metal, or with some alloy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGold\r\nAu\r\nPl. 5\r\n\r\nUsually non-crystalline, but occasionally showing cube or octahedral\r\nfaces of the isometric system; hardness 2.5; specific gravity 19.3;\r\ncolor golden yellow; luster metallic; opaque.\r\n\r\nGold is mostly found as the metal and is readily recognized by its\r\ncolor, considerable weight, hardness, malleability, and the fact that it\r\ndoes not tarnish. It usually occurs in quartz veins in fine to thick\r\nthreads, scales or grains, and occasionally in larger masses termed\r\n“nuggets.” It is insoluble in most liquids so that when weathered from\r\nits original sites, it was often washed down into stream beds, to be\r\nfound later in the sands or gravels, or even in the sea beaches. When\r\nthus found it is termed “placer gold,” and its recovery is placer\r\nmining. Most of the original discoveries of gold have been in these\r\nplacer deposits; and from them it has been traced back to the ledges\r\nfrom which it originally weathered. In the placer deposits the size of\r\nthe particles varies from fine “dust” up to large nuggets, the largest\r\nfound in California weighing 161 pounds; but the largest one found in\r\nthe world was the “Welcome Nugget,” found in Australia, and weighing 248\r\npounds. When gold was discovered in California in 1848, this became the\r\nchief source for the world, but later this distinction went to\r\nAustralia, and now belongs to South Africa, which today yields over half\r\nthe annual supply.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate source of gold is from the lighter colored igneous rocks,\r\nlike granites, syenites, and diorites, throughout which it is diffused\r\nin quantities too small to be either visible or worth while to extract.\r\nIt becomes available only when it has been dissolved out by percolating\r\nwaters and segregated in fissures or veins, either in or leading from\r\nthese igneous rocks. Generally this transfer of gold has taken place\r\nwhen the rocks were at high temperatures, and by the aid of water (and\r\nperhaps other solvents) which was also at high temperatures. The\r\npresence of gold in sandstones, limestones, etc., is secondary, as is\r\nalso its presence in sea water, in which there is reported to be nearly\r\na grain (about five cents worth) in every ton of water. Beside the\r\ndirect recovery of gold from gold mining, a great deal is obtained from\r\nits association with iron, copper, silver, lead and zinc sulphides, in\r\nwhich it is included in particles too fine to be visible, but in\r\nquantities large enough to be separated from the other metals after they\r\nare smelted.\r\n\r\nIn the United States gold is found in the Cordilleran region from\r\nCalifornia to Alaska, in Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, the Black\r\nHills of South Dakota, and in small quantities in the metamorphosed\r\nslates of North and South Carolina, Georgia, and in Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Silver Group\r\n\r\nThough much commoner than gold, silver did not attract the eye of man as\r\nearly, probably because it tarnishes when exposed to air or any other\r\nagent having sulphur compounds in it, and a black film of silver\r\nsulphide covers the surface. Its first use was for ornaments, and some\r\nof these found in the ruins of ancient Troy indicate its use as early as\r\n2500 B.C. A thousand years later it was being used to make basins, vases\r\nand other vessels.\r\n\r\nSilver is next to gold in malleability and ductility, so that a grain of\r\nsilver can be drawn out into a wire 400 feet long, or beaten into leaves\r\n¹/₁₀₀₀₀₀ of an inch in thickness. As a conductor of electricity it is\r\nunsurpassed, being rated at 100% while copper rates 93%. Silver is also\r\nlike gold in the freedom with which it alloys with other metals, such as\r\ngold, copper, iron, platinum, etc. All our silver coins, tableware,\r\netc., have some copper alloyed with the silver to give it greater\r\nhardness and durability.\r\n\r\nUnlike gold, silver freely enters into compounds with the non-metals,\r\nwhich is the reason that it is not found primarily in its native state,\r\nbut usually as a sulphide. Its ultimate source is in the igneous rocks,\r\nfew granites or lavas, on analysis, failing to show at least traces of\r\nsilver. Before it is available as an ore, or mineral, it has been\r\ndissolved from the original magma, and segregated in fissures or veins,\r\nalong with such minerals, as quartz, fluorite, calcite, etc. This seems\r\nto have taken place while the igneous rocks were still hot, and by the\r\nagency of vapors and liquids which were also hot. The presence of silver\r\nin sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, or even in sea water, is\r\nsecondary.\r\n\r\nThe primary deposition of silver is usually in the form of sulphides,\r\nthe commoner of which are, argentite or silver sulphide, pyrargyrite or\r\nsilver and antimony sulphide, and prousite, or silver and arsenic\r\nsulphide. Its occurrence as native silver, or the chloride, cerargyrite,\r\nis secondary and due to the reactions which have taken place when\r\nsulphide deposits have been subjected to weathering agents.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces about 25% of the world’s supply, Mexico some\r\n35%. It is especially found along the Cordilleran ranges of both North\r\nand South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nSilver\r\nAg\r\nPl. 6\r\n\r\nUsually non-crystalline, but occasionally showing cube or octahedron\r\nfaces of the isometric system; hardness 2.5; specific gravity 10.5;\r\ncolor silvery white; luster metallic; opaque.\r\n\r\nWhen found in its native state silver is usually in wirey, flakey, or\r\nmossy masses; but sometimes masses of considerable size occur, the most\r\nfamous being an 800 pound nugget found in Peru, and another of 500\r\npounds weight found at Konsberg, Norway, and now preserved in\r\nCopenhagen. When exposed to the air the surface soon tarnishes and takes\r\non a black color which must be scraped off to see the real color.\r\n\r\nLike gold, silver is usually found associated with other metals, like\r\niron, copper, lead and zinc; and much of the silver recovered is\r\nobtained in connection with the mining, especially of copper and lead.\r\nSome lead ores have so much silver in them that they are better worth\r\nmining for the silver; galena, for instance, under such circumstances\r\nbeing termed argentiferous galena. Native silver is a secondary mineral,\r\nhaving been formed by the reduction of some one of its sulphides by\r\nwater, carrying various elements which had a greater affinity for the\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\nSilver is found along with copper in the Lake Superior region, and in\r\nIdaho, Nevada, and California.\r\n\r\n\r\nArgentite\r\nAgS\r\nPl. 6\r\n_silver glance_\r\n\r\nUsually in irregular masses, but sometimes in cubes; hardness 2.5;\r\nspecific gravity 7.3; color and streak lead gray; luster metallic;\r\nopaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nArgentite, the simple sulphide of silver, is the chief source from which\r\nsilver is obtained. It looks like galena, and has the same hardness,\r\nstreak and specific gravity, but can be distinguished by the galena\r\nhaving a very perfect cubic cleavage while the argentite has no\r\ncleavage. Argentite is easily cut with a knife (sectile). It is usually\r\nfound in irregular masses, but sometimes in cubes which make very choice\r\ncabinet specimens; and is associated with such other minerals as galena,\r\nsphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, fluorite, quartz, and calcite.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in fissures and veins all through the Cordilleran regions,\r\nespecially in California, Colorado, Nevada (Comstock Lode), Arizona\r\n(Silver King Mine) and about the shores of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyrargyrite\r\nAg₃SbS₃\r\nPl. 7\r\n_ruby silver_ or _dark red silver_\r\n\r\nUsually occurs in irregular masses; hardness 2.5; specific gravity 5.8;\r\ncolor dark red to black; streak purplish red; luster metallic to\r\nadamantine; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nPyrargyrite, the sulphide of silver and antimony, is distinguished by\r\nits dark red color and the purplish streak. It may look like prousite,\r\nbut is easily distinguished from the latter which has a scarlet streak.\r\nIt also at times looks like hematite and cinnabar, but the hematite has\r\na hardness of 6, and the latter has the bright red color throughout,\r\nwhile pyrargyrite turns black when exposed to the light, so that the\r\ncharacteristic red color will be seen only on fresh surfaces. The\r\ncharacteristic red color can only be kept on the mineral if it is\r\nconstantly protected from the light.\r\n\r\nSometimes pyrargyrite occurs in crystals and these belong to the\r\nhexagonal system, and are prisms with low faces on the ends, as on plate\r\n7, and the mineral is peculiar in that the faces on the opposite ends\r\nare unlike.\r\n\r\nPyrargyrite is found mostly in fissures and veins of quartz, fluorite,\r\ncalcite, etc., and associated with pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, etc. It\r\nis fairly common in Colorado in Gunnison and Ouray counties, in Nevada,\r\nNew Mexico, Arizona, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nProusite\r\nAg₃ AsS₃\r\nPl. 7\r\n_light red_\r\n_silver_\r\n\r\nUsually occurs in irregular masses; hardness 2.5; specific gravity 5.6;\r\ncolor scarlet to vermilion; streak the same; luster adamantine;\r\ntransparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nIn general this mineral is very like pyrargyrite, but has the scarlet\r\ncolor and streak which are entirely characteristic. It is likely to have\r\nthe surface tarnished black, which happens on exposure to light, so that\r\nit is essential to be sure that fresh surfaces are being examined.\r\nOccasionally it is found in crystals, of the same type as the preceding\r\nmineral. It is generally found associated with pyrargyrite.\r\n\r\n\r\nCerargyrite\r\nAgCl\r\n_horn silver_\r\n\r\nUsually found in irregular masses or incrustations; hardness 1 to 1½;\r\nspecific gravity 5.5; color pearly gray, grayish green to colorless, but\r\nturning violet brown on exposure to light; luster resinous; transparent\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is usually found in thin seams or waxy incrustations, but\r\nit may occur in crystals in which case they are cubes. It is very soft\r\nand easily cut with a knife, which with its tendency to turn\r\nviolet-brown on exposure to light, makes it easy to identify.\r\nCerargyrite is a secondary mineral, resulting from the action of\r\nchlorine-bearing water on some one of the sulphides of silver. It is\r\nfound in the upper portions of mines, especially those in arid regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Copper Group\r\n\r\nAfter gold the next metal to be utilized was copper. About 4000 B.C. our\r\nearly forefathers found that by heating certain rocks, they obtained a\r\nmetal which could be pounded, ground and carved into useful shapes.\r\nCuriously enough the rocks which had the copper also had some tin in\r\nthem, so that this first-found copper was not pure, but had from five to\r\nten per cent of tin in it, making the resulting metal harder, and what\r\nwe call bronze. It was some thousands of years later before they\r\ndistinguished the copper as a pure metal, but it worked and made good\r\ntools. The newly found metal was not as ornamental as gold; but, because\r\nit could be made into tools, it had a tremendous influence on man’s\r\ndevelopment. As the bronze tools began to take the place of the stone\r\nimplements, the “Age of Bronze” was ushered in. In America the Indians\r\nin the Lake Superior region found native copper weathered out of the\r\nrocks and later mined it, and they too pounded it into knives, axes,\r\nneedles, and ornaments, but probably never learned to melt it and mold\r\ntheir tools. At any rate they were not as far advanced in using this\r\nmetal when Columbus landed as were the southern Europeans 6500 years\r\nearlier. Since the use of iron became general, copper has not held such\r\na dominant place, but it still is “the red metal” which holds the second\r\nmost important place.\r\n\r\nIt is malleable and ductile, though not equal to gold or silver in these\r\nrespects. It is a good conductor of electricity and a very large amount\r\nof copper is used in electrical manufacture, roofing, wire, etc. It\r\nalloys with other metals; ten parts copper and one of tin being bronze,\r\nten of copper and one of zinc is brass, and copper with aluminum is\r\naluminum bronze.\r\n\r\nLike silver and gold, copper is widely diffused through the igneous\r\nrocks, but before it is available, it must be leached out by solvents\r\nand concentrated in veins, fissures, or definite parts of the lavas or\r\ngranites. The primary ores are those which, while the igneous rock was\r\nstill hot, were carried by hot vapors and liquids into the fissures and\r\nthere deposited, mostly as sulphides. There is a long list of these, but\r\nin this country, the following are the commoner ones; chalcocite the\r\nsulphide of copper, chalcopyrite the sulphide of copper and iron,\r\nbornite another combination of copper, iron and sulphur, and\r\ntetrahedrite copper and antimony sulphide. When these primary ores are\r\nnear enough to the surface to come in contact with waters carrying\r\noxygen, carbon dioxide or silica in solution, they may give up their\r\nsulphur and take some one of these new elements and we have such forms\r\nas cuprite, the oxide of copper, malachite and azurite, carbonates of\r\ncopper, or chrysocolla, the silicate of copper. Native copper is also a\r\nsecondary deposit laid down in its present state by a combination of\r\ncircumstances which deprived it of its original sulphur. In general\r\ncopper mining can not be profitably carried on for ores with anything\r\nless than a half of one percent in them; and the use of such low grade\r\nores has only been possible for a few years, as the result of inventing\r\nmost delicate processes in the smelting.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces about a quarter of the world’s supply of\r\ncopper, with Chile ranking second with about 17%.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopper\r\nCu\r\nPl. 8\r\n\r\nUsually in irregular masses; hardness 2.5; specific gravity 8.9; color\r\ncopper red; luster metallic; opaque. Native copper, easily determined by\r\nits color and hardness, is generally found in irregular grains, sheets,\r\nor masses, on which may sometimes be detected traces of a cube or an\r\noctahedral face, showing that it belongs to the isometric system. The\r\nmost famous locality is the Upper Peninsula of Michigan which may be\r\ntaken as typical. Here, long before it was known historically, the\r\nIndians found and dug out copper to make knives, awls, and ornaments.\r\n\r\nIn this region, beds of lava alternate with sandstones and\r\nconglomerates. The copper was originally in the lavas, but has been\r\ndissolved out, and now fills cracks and gas cavities in the lavas, and\r\nalso the spaces between the pebbles of the conglomerate. This locality\r\nhas been very famous both because of the quantity mined, and also\r\nbecause of the strikingly large masses sometimes found. Today but little\r\nof the ore runs above 2 percent copper, and it is mined if it has as\r\nlittle as ½ of one percent.\r\n\r\nWhile nowhere near as abundant, native copper occurs in the same way in\r\ncavities and cracks in the trap rocks of New Jersey, and along the south\r\nshore of the Bay of Fundy. It is also known from Oregon, the White River\r\nregion of Alaska, and in Arctic Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalcopyrite\r\nCuFeS₂\r\nPl. 8\r\n_copper pyrites_ or _yellow copper ore_\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals of irregular masses; hardness 4; specific gravity\r\n4.2; color bronze yellow; streak greenish black; luster metallic; opaque\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nChalcopyrite resembles pyrite, but its color is a more golden yellow,\r\nand its surface tarnishes with iridescent colors. Then too the hardness\r\nof chalcopyrite is but 4 as compared with 6 for pyrite. When in crystals\r\nthis mineral belongs to the tetrahedral system as the c axis is but .985\r\nin length as compared with I for the two other axes. This difference is\r\nso little that, to the eye, the octahedron appears to belong to the\r\nisometric system. Chalcopyrite occurs in octahedrons and tetrahedrons\r\n(as on plate 8), the latter being the form where but half of the\r\noctahedral faces are developed. However by far the most frequent mode of\r\noccurrence is in irregular masses.\r\n\r\nThis is the most important primary ore of copper, and is widely\r\ndistributed, being found either in lavas, or in veins, or in fissures\r\nconnected with igneous rocks. Apparently the deposits were made, either\r\nat the time of eruptive disturbances or shortly afterward, from vapors\r\nor hot solutions carrying the copper sulphides (and other sulphides)\r\nfrom the molten igneous rocks. Chalcopyrite is usually associated with\r\npyrite, galena, sphalerite and chalcocite, as well as quartz, fluorite\r\nand calcite. It is found in all the New England States, in New York, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nMissouri, and all the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast States.\r\n\r\n\r\nBornite\r\nCu₃FeS₃\r\n_purple copper ore_\r\n\r\nOccurs in granular or compact masses; hardness 3; specific gravity, 5;\r\ncolor bronze-brown with a bluish tarnish; streak gray-black; luster\r\nmetallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nBornite is also known as erubescite, blushing ore, variegated copper,\r\npeacock copper, etc., all of which names refer to the highly iridescent\r\ntarnish which fresh faces soon take on when exposed to the air. Though\r\nusually in masses, it is sometimes found in rough cubes of the isometric\r\nsystem. In this country it is not abundant enough to be used as an ore,\r\nbut is likely to be found with other ores like chalcopyrite or\r\nchalcocite. In the east it has been found at Bristol, Conn., and near\r\nWilkesbarre, Penn., while in the west it may be expected to occur\r\nwherever other sulphide minerals of copper are found.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalcocite\r\nCu₂S\r\nPl. 9\r\n_copper glance_\r\n\r\nOccurs in fine grained compact masses; hardness 2.5; specific gravity\r\n5.7; color dark leaden gray; streak black; luster metallic; opaque on\r\nthin edges.\r\n\r\nChalcocite is one of the important ores of copper, especially in Arizona\r\nand the Butte District of Montana. It resembles argentite in color and\r\ngeneral appearance, but is readily distinguished by being brittle and\r\nhaving a tendency to tarnish to bluish or greenish colors on fresh\r\nsurfaces. Occasionally it occurs in crystals which are in the\r\northorhombic system; but the edges of the prism are so beveled that\r\nthere are six sides and the prism resembles a hexagonal prism (see page\r\n16).\r\n\r\nIn the Butte, Mont., district, the most important copper region in the\r\nUnited States, fully 50% of the ore is chalcocite, which is a derivative\r\nof the originally deposited chalcopyrite, the latter having lost its\r\niron. In the veins of this district chalcopyrite, bournite,\r\ntetrahedrite, and several other copper minerals not described in this\r\nbook, occur all together, and with them also gold, silver and arsenic\r\nminerals. The gold amounts to about 2¼ cents per pound of copper, and\r\nthe silver is in somewhat less quantity. These veins were first opened\r\nto get the silver ores, which were the more important ones down to a\r\ndepth of 200 to 400 feet. Below these depths the copper became much more\r\nimportant. It was the weathering which had removed a large part of the\r\ncopper minerals in the upper levels of the veins, but had left a large\r\npart of the silver. Chalcocite is also important in most of the Utah and\r\nArizona mines.\r\n\r\nIn the east it has been found at Bristol, Simsbury and Cheshire, Conn.,\r\nand in the west it is found in all the Cordilleran States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTetrahedrite\r\nCu₃SbS₃\r\nPl. 9 & 10\r\n_gray copper ore_\r\n\r\nOccurs in irregular masses and in tetrahedrons of the isometric system;\r\nhardness 3.5; specific gravity 4.7; streak dark brown; luster metallic;\r\nopaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nIn its crystalline form the tetrahedrite occurs in tetrahedrons, which\r\ngenerally have faces formed by beveling the edges and by cutting the\r\ncorners, as in the two figures of plate 10. Chalcopyrite may also occur\r\nin tetrahedrons, but its golden yellow color is entirely different from\r\nthe gray-black of the tetrahedrite. When in masses the hardness and the\r\nstreak which is dark brown, are very characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn England and Bolivia tetrahedrite is an important ore of copper, but\r\nin this country it is simply a copper mineral which is widely\r\ndistributed, and associated with most of the mining enterprises, but is\r\nin no case the important ore. It has been found sparingly through the\r\nNew England States, at the Kellogg Mines in Arkansas, and abundantly in\r\nColorado, Montana, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuprite\r\nCu₂O\r\nPl. 9 & 10\r\n_red copper ore_\r\n\r\nOccurs in isometric cubes, octahedrons, and dodecahedrons, or in masses;\r\nhardness 3.5; specific gravity 6; color dark brownish-red; streak\r\nbrownish-red; luster metallic; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhen in crystals cuprite is easily determined, but when in masses its\r\nfresh surfaces may suggest prousite, but the streak and hardness are\r\nquite different in the two cases. Sometimes its color suggests hematite,\r\nbut the latter has the hardness of 6. When found it is often coated with\r\na thin film of green, which is malachite.\r\n\r\nExcept when found as native copper, the ore which contains the greatest\r\npercentage of copper is cuprite with 88.8% of copper. It is likely to\r\noccur in any of the deposits of copper ore, where they are in arid\r\nclimates and above the level of the underground water, and is very\r\nfrequently associated with malachite and azurite. In the Bisbee,\r\nArizona, district cuprite is one of the important ores.\r\n\r\nBesides the normal occurrence described above, cuprite may be found in\r\ntwo other varieties; one where the crystals have grown side by side and\r\nso only the ends have been free for continuous additions of the mineral,\r\nwhich has resulted in a fibrous mass known as “plush copper ore” or\r\nchalcotrichite; the other an earthy mixture of limonite and cuprite,\r\nwhich is brick red in color, and termed “tile ore.”\r\n\r\nCuprite is found sparingly in New England, more abundantly at such\r\nplaces as Summerville and Flemington, N. J., Cornwall, Penn., in the\r\nLake Superior region, and fairly abundantly in the Cordilleran States.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalachite\r\nCuCO₃·Cu(OH)₂\r\nPl. 11\r\n\r\nUsually occurs in nodular or incrusting masses; hardness 3.5; specific\r\ngravity 4; color green; streak a lighter green; luster adamantine, silky\r\nor dull; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThe vivid green of malachite is usually enough to determine it at once,\r\nbut one may be sure by trying a drop of acid on it, in which case it\r\neffervesces as is characteristic of so many carbonates, but this is the\r\nonly carbonate which is vivid green. Generally the malachite is in\r\nirregular masses, but crystals are occasionally found. These are\r\nextremely small and needle-like, and belong to the monoclinic system. In\r\nthe Ural Mountains there is a locality where these crystals grow in\r\nfibrous masses, usually radiating from the center. Malachite in such\r\nnodules has a silky luster. These rare nodules have furnished the rulers\r\nof Russia with a unique and much prized material for making royal gifts.\r\nIn European museums and palaces one finds many objects carved from this\r\nform of malachite, and marked as gifts of the czars of Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the United States malachite is widely distributed, appearing as green\r\nstreaks and stains where copper minerals have been exposed to the air.\r\nIt is the green tarnish which appears on bronze and copper when exposed\r\nto the weather. It is found in large quantities in New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, etc. The\r\nBisbee mine in Arizona is the place that has furnished museums with so\r\nmany of the handsome specimens of malachite associated with azurite.\r\nThese are the most striking specimens for the vividness of their colors\r\nthat appear in any collections.\r\n\r\nMalachite has been known since about 4000 B.C., the Egyptians having\r\nmines where they obtained it between the Suez and Mt. Sinai. In those\r\nearly days it was particularly a child’s charm, protecting the wearer\r\nfrom evil spirits. It is still used as a stone of lesser value in making\r\nsome sorts of jewelry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAzurite\r\n2CuCO₃·Cu(OH)₂\r\nPl. 11\r\n\r\nOccurs as short prismatic or tabular crystals of the monoclinic system;\r\nhardness 4; specific gravity 3.8; color azure blue; streak lighter blue;\r\nluster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nAzurite is another very striking mineral fully characterized by its\r\ncolor and streak. Like malachite it effervesces in acid. It is very near\r\nto malachite in composition, and by increasing its water content, can\r\nand freely does change to the green mineral; so that few specimens of\r\nazurite are without traces of malachite. It is found in the same places\r\nas malachite, but is not as abundant in the east.\r\n\r\nAzurite with the accompanying malachite is cut and polished to make\r\nsemi-precious stones for some forms of jewelry.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysocolla\r\nCuSiO₃·2H₂O\r\n\r\nNever occurs in crystals, but in seams and incrustations; hardness 2-4;\r\nspecific gravity 2.1; color bluish-green; streak white; luster vitreous;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis rather rare mineral often appears in opal- or enamel-like\r\nincrustations, and its color is variable ranging from the typical\r\nbluish-green to sky-blue or even turquoise blue. This is a mineral\r\nresulting from the action of silica bearing waters, coming in contact\r\nwith most any of the copper minerals, and is found accompanying cuprite,\r\nmalachite, azurite, etc. It is never in large enough quantities to be\r\nused as an ore, but its striking color attracts attention and it can be\r\nfound fairly frequently, especially in the west.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Iron Group\r\n\r\nPure iron is a chemical curiosity which looks very much like silver. As\r\nobtained from its ores, or as it occurs in Nature, iron always has some\r\nimpurities with it, such as carbon, silicon, sulphur and phosphorus, and\r\nthese are highest in the crudest iron such as “pig-iron.” Its\r\nmalleability and ductility are only a little less than for gold and\r\nsilver, and so it has a wide range of qualities for use by man. It is\r\nonly rarely found native in minute grains in some of the dark lavas.\r\nThere is however one remarkable exception to this statement, in that on\r\nDisco Island, Greenland, there is a basaltic rock, from which are\r\nweathered great boulders of native iron up to 20 tons in weight. This\r\niron is very like that occurring in meteorites, and probably came from\r\ngreat depths in the earth’s interior. The specific gravity of iron is\r\n7.8. It makes up around 5% of the crust of the earth, and probably\r\noccurs in much larger percentages in the interior of the earth.\r\n\r\nIron was discovered by man later than gold or silver or copper, about\r\n1000 B.C.; but once found it was so much more abundant than any of these\r\nthat it soon dominated over copper, and from Roman times to the present\r\nhas been the basis of progress in civilization, and these times are well\r\ncalled “the iron age.”\r\n\r\nIron unites freely with the non-metals, and occurs as sulphides, oxides,\r\ncarbonates, etc., and is also present as a secondary metal in that great\r\ngroup of minerals known as the silicates (see page 97). It alloys with a\r\nwide range of other metals, every combination altering the properties of\r\nthe iron, and thus making it useful in a still greater range of\r\nmanufacture. The introduction of ¼ to 2½% of carbon into iron makes\r\nsteel, which is harder (in proportion to the amount of carbon) and\r\nstronger than the pure iron.\r\n\r\nIron compounds are among the most numerous and important of the colors\r\nin Nature’s paint box, limonite furnishing the browns which color the\r\nsoil and so many of the rocks, hematite giving the red color to other\r\nabundant rocks, and magnetite often coloring igneous rocks black, while\r\nthe chlorophyll which gives the green color to plants is an iron\r\ncompound, as is also the hemoglobin which gives the red to our blood.\r\n\r\nIron is present in all igneous rocks, and secondarily in the sedimentary\r\nand metamorphic rocks. It is soluble in water, and so is being\r\nconstantly transferred from place to place, and changes from one\r\ncompound to another, according to the circumstances in which it is\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nThe primary forms are pyrite, magnetite and the silicates. When in\r\nweathered rocks the iron is changed to limonite, siderite or hydrated\r\nsilicates. Hematite is an intermediate oxide from which the water\r\ncontained in limonite has been driven off by moderate heat or bacterial\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimonite\r\n2Fe₂O₃·3H₂O\r\nPl. 12\r\n\r\nNever crystalline, occurs in mammillary, botryoidal and stalactitic\r\nforms, or in fibrous, compact, oolitic, nodular or earthly masses;\r\nhardness 5.5; specific gravity 3.8; color yellow-brown to black; streak\r\nyellow-brown; luster metallic to dull; opaque.\r\n\r\nLimonite is a very common mineral, the color, streak and hardness\r\nidentifying it readily. Iron rust is its most familiar form. When\r\npowdered it is the ochre yellow used in paints. Being so universally\r\ndistributed, it is to be expected it will occur in a variety of ways.\r\nFirst, there is the fibrous type found lining cavities, in geodes, or\r\nhanging in stalactites in caves. This has a silky luster, an opalescent,\r\nglazed or black surface, and is in mammillated or botryoidal masses.\r\nSecond, it may occur in compact masses in veins, where it was deposited\r\nby waters; which, circulating through the adjacent rocks, gathered it\r\nfrom the rocks, and, on reaching the open seams, gave it up again.\r\nThird, it may occur in beds on the bottom of ponds, where it was\r\ndeposited by waters which gathered it as they flowed over the surface of\r\nthe country rocks. Measurements in Sweden show that it may accumulate in\r\nsuch places as much as six inches in the course of twenty years. In\r\nponds and swamps, the decaying vegetation forms organic compounds, which\r\ncause the precipitation of the iron from the water, as it is brought in\r\nby the streams. This sort of iron in the bottom of ponds or swamps is\r\nalso known as “bog iron.” Another form in which limonite may occur in\r\nponds, lakes, or even the sea, is in oolitic masses. In this case the\r\niron forms in tiny balls, with perhaps a grain of sand at the center,\r\nand one coat of iron after another formed around it, like the layers of\r\nan onion. If the resulting balls are tiny this is called oolitic (like\r\nfish eggs), but if the balls are larger it is pisolitic (like peas).\r\nBacteria probably have a good deal to do with the precipitation of\r\nlimonite in this manner. Fourth, limonite occurs in earthy masses,\r\nusually mixed with impurities like clay and sand, which are the residue\r\nleft behind, where limestones have been dissolved by weathering. The\r\nfifth mode of occurrence is known as gossan, or “the iron hat,” which is\r\na mass of limonite capping a vein of some sulphide mineral, like pyrite,\r\nchalcopyrite or pyrrhotite, which has been exposed to weathering; and in\r\nthese minerals the sulphur has been removed, leaving a mass of limonite\r\nover the vein. This is particularly common in the west. Limonite is\r\nquite easily fusible and so was probably the first ore from which early\r\nman extracted iron.\r\n\r\nLimonite is iron oxide, with 3 molecules of water of crystallization (or\r\nconstitution) associated with every 2 molecules of the oxide. If\r\nlimonite is moderately heated the water is driven out and the resulting\r\ncompound is hematite, the same oxide, but without the water. In this\r\ncase and many other similar cases, as gypsum, opal, etc., we have two or\r\nmore minerals resulting from the presence or absence of water in the\r\nmineral. The water molecules have a definite place in the arrangement of\r\nmolecules which determines the structure of the mineral. Sometimes the\r\nwater is driven out at a temperature around 212 F., in which case it is\r\ncalled, water of crystallization, but in other cases as gypsum, a\r\nconsiderably higher temperature is required to drive out the water, and\r\nthen it is called, water of constitution. In all cases the removal of\r\nthe water changes the arrangement of molecules and a new mineral\r\nresults, with characteristics of its own.\r\n\r\nIn this case limonite is only one of a series of minerals which have the\r\nFe₂O₃ molecule as a basis, and that incorporate more or less water into\r\ntheir molecular construction as follows:\r\n\r\n  Turgite               2Fe₂O₃·H₂O\r\n  Goethite              Fe₂O₃·H₂O\r\n  Limonite              2Fe₂O₃·3H₂O\r\n  Xanthosiderite        Fe₂O₃·2H₂O\r\n  Limonite              Fe₂O₃·3H₂O\r\n\r\nOf these goethite is crystalline, the others non-crystalline. They may\r\noccur pure or in all sorts of mixtures, the mixtures usually being\r\nlumped under limonite. The limonite is far the commonest of the series,\r\ngoethite is fairly common, but the others are rare as pure minerals.\r\n\r\nLimonite is found in all parts of all states and in every country.\r\nThough so common, it is by no means an important source of iron today,\r\nonly about one percent of the iron mined in this country coming from\r\nthis source, though in Germany, Sweden and Scotland it is relatively\r\nmuch more important.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoethite\r\nFe₂O₃·H₂O\r\nPl. 12\r\n\r\nOccurs in lustrous brown to black orthorhombic prisms, usually\r\nterminated by low pyramids; hardness 5; specific gravity 4; color brown\r\nto black; streak brownish-yellow; luster imperfect adamantine; opaque.\r\n\r\nGoethite, named for the poet Goethe, who was interested in mineralogy,\r\nis much less abundant than limonite or hematite, but occurs with them,\r\nwhen they are in veins. Its usual form is an orthorhombic prism with the\r\nedges beveled, and a low pyramid on either end. The crystals usually\r\ngrow in clusters, making a fibrous mass, often radiated, in which case\r\nit is known as “needle iron stone”; or the prisms may be so short as to\r\nbe almost scales; when, because of the yellowish-red color, it is called\r\n“ruby mica”. It is found in many states, including Connecticut,\r\nMichigan, Colorado, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHematite\r\nFe₂O₃\r\nPl. 13 & 14\r\n_specular iron_\r\n\r\nOccurs in compact, mammillary, botryoidal, or stalactitic masses of dark\r\nred to black color, or in earthy masses of bright to dark red; hardness\r\n6; specific gravity 5.2; color ochre red to black; streak cherry red to\r\ndark red; luster metallic, vitreous, or dull; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nHematite is readily distinguished from other red minerals by its\r\nhardness and streak. It may occur in crystals, which belong to the\r\nhexagonal system, and are usually hemihedral forms of the double\r\npyramid, or rhombohedrons. These rhombohedrons usually have the edges\r\nbeveled, as in Pl. 13, A; or are tabular in form as a result of the\r\nbeveling of two of the opposite edges to such an extent that a form like\r\nPl. 13 B results. However the usual occurrence is in non-crystalline\r\nmasses, which represent transformations from limonite by the loss of\r\nwater of crystallization on the part of the limonite. In such cases we\r\nhave fibrous, oolitic or compact masses, according to the form in which\r\nthe limonite occurred. The transformation from limonite into hematite\r\ninvolves some heat to drive out the water of crystallization, but\r\nnothing like what is involved in metamorphism.\r\n\r\nHematite is the source of 90% of the iron mined in this country. Part of\r\nit comes from the famous Clinton iron ore, a layer a foot or more in\r\nthickness; starting in New York State, and extending all down the\r\nAppalachian Mountains to Alabama, where it is ten or more feet thick and\r\nthe basis of the Birmingham iron industries. Then there are tremendous\r\ndeposits of earthy to compact hematite, probably derived from limonite,\r\naround the west end of Lake Superior. This latter region yields today\r\naround 75% of the iron for this country.\r\n\r\nLoose earthy masses of hematite are often known as “ochre red,” and were\r\nused by the Indians for war paint. Today the same sort of material is\r\nobtained by powdering hematite and using it for red paint. The red color\r\nin great stretches of rock is due to the presence of small amounts of\r\nhematite, acting as cementing material. The red of the ruby, garnet,\r\nspinel, and the pink of feldspars and calcite are due to traces of\r\nhematite.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is very common and found in every state.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnetite\r\nFe₃O₄\r\nPl. 14\r\n_Magnetic iron ore_\r\n\r\nOccurs in masses or in isometric octahedrons or dodecahedrons; hardness\r\n6; specific gravity 5.8; color black; streak black; luster metallic;\r\nopaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nMagnetite is another important ore of iron, and is peculiar in being\r\nstrongly magnetic; its name being derived, according to Pliny, from that\r\nof the shepherd Magnes, who found his iron pointed staff attracted by\r\nthe mineral when he was wandering on Mount Ida. This magnetic property\r\nhas been repeatedly used to locate beds of magnetite, and is very\r\nhelpful in separating magnetite from the “black sands,” of which it so\r\noften forms a part. These sands however generally have magnetite with so\r\nmuch titanium in it that they are unfit for smelting.\r\n\r\nMagnetite is found in association with igneous or metamorphic rocks, and\r\noften represents limonite or hematite which has been altered as the\r\nresult of high temperatures. Some of it, in the igneous rocks\r\nespecially, was undoubtedly in the molten magma and has crystallized out\r\nfrom the magma while it was still hot. It is the form of iron always\r\nindicative of former high temperatures. It is an ore mineral for about\r\n3% of the iron in this country, but in Scandinavia and some other\r\ncountries, it plays a leading role as the source of iron.\r\n\r\nIt is found in the Adirondack Mountains, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nArkansas, North Carolina, New Mexico, and California.\r\n\r\n\r\nSiderite\r\nFeCO₃\r\nPl. 13 & 14\r\n_Spathic iron_\r\n\r\nOccurs in fibrous botryoidal masses or rhombohedral crystals, sometimes\r\nwith curved faces; hardness 3.5; specific gravity 3.8; color gray-brown;\r\nstreak white; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nLike hematite this mineral belongs to the hexagonal system, and\r\ncrystallizes in hemihedral form, making the rhombohedron. Its faces are\r\noften curved, which is rare in minerals, only a few forms like this and\r\ndolomite having other than plane faces. When siderite crystals grow in\r\nclusters, the crowding often results in growth on one face only, making\r\na mass of fibrous character, and in such cases the surface of the mass\r\nis botryoidal in contour. The mineral is likely to oxidize, losing its\r\ngray-brown color, and becoming limonite. In the United States it is\r\nscarcely ever used as an ore for iron, but in Germany and England a\r\ngreat deal of iron is smelted from this mineral.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, throughout the\r\nAppalachian Mountains, and also in Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyrite\r\nFeS₂\r\nPl. 15 & 16\r\n_iron pyrites_\r\n\r\nOccurs as cubes, octahedrons and pyritohedrons, or in compact masses,\r\nscales or grains; hardness 6; specific gravity 5.1; color brassy yellow;\r\nstreak greenish-black; luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the commonest of all minerals. It is found in all kinds\r\nof rocks, with all kinds of associations, in all parts of the world. Its\r\ncrystals are isometric, and cubes and octahedrons are abundant. The\r\npyritohedron is also a common form, and characteristic of this mineral.\r\nIt is a hemihedral form derived from a 24-sided form, _i.e._ the cube\r\nwith four faces on each side. On this 24-sided form each alternate face\r\nhas developed and the others have disappeared, resulting in a 12-sided\r\nform, known as the pyritohedron, which differs from the dodecahedron in\r\nthat each of its faces is five-sided instead of rhomboidal. When in\r\ncrystals pyrite can not be easily confused with any other mineral; but\r\nwhen in masses it is often mistaken for gold, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite\r\nor marcasite. From the first two, the color should be sufficient to\r\ndistinguish it, for they are golden yellow. Pyrrhotite is bronze yellow,\r\nand marcasite is paler yellow. Then too in hardness pyrite is much\r\nharder than any of these minerals except marcasite. This last is the one\r\nwhich is most likely to cause real difficulty. Its lighter color, and\r\nthe fact that it usually comes in fibrous masses are the best\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\nIn spite of being so abundant pyrite is scarcely ever used as an ore for\r\niron, because the sulphur makes the metal “short,” or brittle, and the\r\nsulphur is not easily gotten entirely out of the iron; but pyrite is\r\nused largely in the manufacture of sulphuric acid, so important to many\r\nof our industries.\r\n\r\nOther sulphides are commonly mixed with pyrite, such as chalcopyrite,\r\narsenopyrite, argentite, etc.; but the most important impurity is gold,\r\nwhich is often scattered through the pyrite in invisible particles, and\r\nsometimes in quantities enough to make it worth while to smelt it for\r\nthe gold.\r\n\r\nPyrite is particularly the form in which the sulphur compounds of iron\r\nappear in rocks which have been highly heated, and is to be expected in\r\nmetamorphic rocks and also igneous rocks, especially in fissures and\r\nveins leading from the igneous rocks. It may occur in sedimentary rocks,\r\nbut in these last it is usually marcasite.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcasite\r\nFeS₂\r\nPl. 15\r\n_white pyrite_\r\n\r\nOccurs in orthorhombic crystals, usually grouped to make fibrous or\r\nradiating masses, or non-crystalline in masses; hardness 6; specific\r\ngravity 4.8; color pale brassy-yellow; streak greenish-gray; luster\r\nmetallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nMarcasite has the same chemical composition, as pyrite, and looks like\r\nit, but is lighter colored and usually occurs in fibrous masses. It is\r\nthe commoner form in limestones and shales, while pyrite is more likely\r\nto occur in igneous and metamorphic rocks. It seems probable that\r\nmarcasite is due to a more hasty precipitation from cold solutions,\r\nwhile pyrite is deposited more slowly from hot solutions.\r\n\r\nIsolated crystals of marcasite are rare; but, if formed, they belong to\r\nthe orthorhombic system. Usually some form of twinning is present, and\r\nbecause of the multiple character of the twinning, marcasite crystals\r\nusually show a ragged outline, with reentrant angles. It is most\r\nabundant in radiated masses, which appear fibrous on the broken\r\nsurfaces. It decomposes easily, taking oxygen from the air and forming,\r\neven in museum cases, a white efflorescence or “flower,” which is iron\r\nsulphate or melanterite. In moist air it takes water and decomposes to\r\nsulphuric acid which may change the surrounding limestone to gypsum.\r\nMarcasite is found wherever limestones and shales are the country rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyrrhotite\r\nFe₁₁S₁₂\r\n_Magnetic pyrites_\r\n\r\nOccurs in masses; hardness 4; specific gravity 4.6; color bronze; streak\r\ngrayish-black; luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nTabular crystals are known, but are very rare. They belong to the\r\nhexagonal system. This form is easily distinguished from the other\r\nyellow minerals by being magnetic. It is by no means as abundant as the\r\ntwo preceding sulphides of iron, but does occur fairly frequently in\r\nveins in igneous rocks, and less frequently in limestones, large\r\nquantities of sulphuric acid being made from a deposit in limestone at\r\nDucktown, Tenn. It will be found in most states. When associated with\r\nnickel it is an important source for the latter mineral, as at Sudbury,\r\nCanada. Pyrrhotite is very like a substance found in meteorites, known\r\nas troilite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Lead Group\r\n\r\nAfter learning how to get iron from the rocks by rude smelting methods,\r\nthe early peoples tried heating various rocks, and some time around 500\r\nB.C. stumbled upon lead, which is rather easily separated from its ores.\r\nThis metal was used through Roman times to make pipes, gutters, etc.\r\n\r\nLead is a soft metal, fairly malleable, but with little ductility, and\r\nstill less tensile strength. Though one of the commoner metals, it does\r\nnot occur as pure metal in Nature. It is diffused in minute quantities\r\nthrough the igneous rocks, and also is found in the sedimentary rocks\r\nand in the sea water. Its minerals are few, galena, the sulphide of\r\nlead, being the commonest, and at the same time the form in which lead\r\nis primarily deposited. Galena may also represent a secondary\r\ndeposition. The other minerals, cerrusite, anglesite, and pyromorphite\r\nare results of modification of the galena when it lies near enough to\r\nthe surface to be acted on by weathering agents, like water and air.\r\nLead minerals are usually associated with zinc minerals, there being but\r\nfew places where the minerals of the one group occur without the other.\r\nMost lead when first smelted from its ore, contains a greater or less\r\namount of silver in it, sometimes enough so that the lead ore is better\r\nworth working for the silver than for the lead.\r\n\r\nLead is used in making pipes, gutters, bullets, etc., and in its oxide\r\nforms in the manufacture of paints and glass. Eighty-three parts of lead\r\nwith 17 parts of antimony make type metal. Lead and tin alloy to make\r\nsolder. Lead and tin with small amounts of copper, zinc and antimony\r\nmake pewter. The United States produce about 20% of the world’s supply\r\nof this metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nGalena\r\nPbS\r\nPl. 17\r\n_lead glance_\r\n\r\nOccurs in cubes or cleavable masses; hardness 2.5; specific gravity 7.5;\r\ncolor lead-gray; streak lead-gray; luster metallic; opaque.\r\n\r\nWhile there is quite a group of lead-gray minerals, galena is easily\r\nidentified by its cleavage, which is perfect in three directions\r\nparallel to the cube faces. Even a moderate blow of the hammer will\r\nshatter a mass of galena into small cubic pieces. The crystals often\r\nhave the corners cut by octahedral faces, and occasionally the edges are\r\nbeveled by dodecahedral faces. It is not uncommon to find crystals of\r\nlarge size, several inches across. If galena has 1 to 2% of bismuth as\r\nan impurity, curiously enough, the cleavage changes to octahedral, but\r\nthis is a rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nGalena may occur as a primary mineral in veins associated with igneous\r\nintrusions, or in irregular masses in metamorphic rocks; but it is more\r\noften found in irregular masses in limestones, where the limestone has\r\nbeen dissolved, and the cavities thus formed, filled with secondary\r\ndeposits of galena. It also occurs at the contact between igneous rocks\r\nand the adjacent rock, whatever this may be. Sometimes it is found in\r\nresidual clays.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important lead deposits are the Cœur d’Alene district in\r\nIdaho, where galena with a high percentage of silver is mined; the\r\nLeadville, Colo., district where lead, silver and gold occur together in\r\nveins; the Joplin, Mo., district, where lead and zinc ores occur\r\ntogether in irregular masses in limestones; and the Wisconsin district\r\nof similar character.\r\n\r\nWhen found galena is usually associated with sphalerite, argentite\r\nchalcopyrite, pyrite and calcite. It will be found in every state.\r\n\r\n\r\nCerrusite\r\nPbCO₃\r\nPl. 18\r\n_White lead ore_\r\n\r\nOccurs in fibrous or compact masses, or in orthorhombic crystals,\r\nusually on galena; hardness 3.5; specific gravity 6.5; colorless; streak\r\nwhite; luster adamantine; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhile the crystals of this mineral simulate hexagonal, they are actually\r\northorhombic, the simple form being an octahedron with two of its edges\r\nbeveled, making double six-sided pyramids (see Pl. 18 A.) Usually prism\r\nfaces are present. Twinning is common, both the simple contact sort, as\r\nshown on Plate 18 B, and also the sort in which three crystals have\r\ngrown through each other, so as to make a six-rayed crystal. The\r\nconsiderable weight, and the fact that it effervesces in acid serve to\r\nidentify cerrusite. When pure it is colorless, but impurities cause it\r\nto appear white, gray or grayish-black, and sometimes it has a tinge of\r\nblue or green.\r\n\r\nIt is likely to occur wherever galena is found, as a secondary mineral\r\nderived from the galena. In this country it is not used as an ore, for,\r\nas in the Leadville district, veins which have cerrusite near the\r\nsurface change at moderate depths, and galena takes the place of the\r\ncerrusite. It is found all down the Appalachian Mountains, and in all\r\nthe Cordilleran States. Especially fine specimens have come from the\r\nCœur d’Alene district in Idaho.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnglesite\r\nPbSO₄\r\nPl. 18\r\n\r\nOccurs in grains and masses, or in tabular and prismatic orthorhombic\r\ncrystals; hardness 3; specific gravity 6.3; colorless; luster\r\nadamantine; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nTwo modes of occurrence are characteristic, one in cavities in galena,\r\nthe other in concentric layers around a nucleus of galena. In the former\r\ncase fine crystals are developed, in the latter the mineral is in\r\nmasses. The crystals look like those of barite, but are soluble in\r\nnitric acid while the barite is insoluble. Sometimes the crystals are\r\nprismatic with pyramidal faces instead of the tabular form.\r\n\r\nIt is found in the lead mines associated with galena, and in this\r\ncountry is not used as an ore for lead, but in Mexico and Australia it\r\nis abundant enough to be mined as an ore. Exposed to water which has\r\ncarbon dioxide in it, and most surface waters have some, it readily\r\nchanges to cerrusite. It is found in Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas,\r\nColorado, and Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyromorphite\r\nPb₅Cl(PO₄)₃\r\nPl. 17\r\n_Green lead ore_\r\n\r\nOccurs in small barrel-shaped hexagonal crystals, and in fibrous or\r\nearthly masses; hardness 3.5; specific gravity 7; color green to brown;\r\nluster resinous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nPyromorphite is found in the upper levels of lead mines, and is formed\r\nby the decomposition of galena. Its green color (sometimes shading off\r\ntoward brown), considerable weight and resinous luster, serve to\r\ndistinguish this mineral. The crystal form is that of a simple hexagonal\r\nprism, with the ends truncated. It is found in Phœnixville, Penn.,\r\nMissouri, Wisconsin, Colorado, New Mexico, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Zinc Group\r\n\r\nZinc and copper made the brass of early Roman times; but even then, zinc\r\nwas not known as a separate metal, the brass being made by smelting\r\nrocks in which both zinc and copper occurred, the zinc never being\r\nisolated until much later. Some time in the later Roman times it seems\r\nto have been obtained separately, but then and all down through the\r\nMiddle Ages zinc and bismuth were confused. Our earliest record of zinc\r\nbeing smelted, as we know it today, was about 1730 in England. In those\r\nearlier days, the product, zinc, or bismuth, or both together, were\r\nknown as “spelter,” and this name has clung to zinc in mining and\r\ncommercial circles; so that today, if one looks for quotations in the\r\nnewspaper, he often finds zinc under the head of spelter.\r\n\r\nZinc, like lead, is diffused in small quantities through all the igneous\r\nrocks. In places it is segregated in fissures or veins leading from the\r\nigneous rocks, along the contact between igneous rocks and either\r\nsedimentary or metamorphic rocks, in limestones where solution cavities\r\nhave been formed and later filled with zinc minerals, and as a residue\r\nwhere limestones have been weathered away. In all these places it is\r\nclosely associated with lead.\r\n\r\nThe sulphide, sphalerite, is the primary mineral, and the other\r\nminerals, like zincite, smithsonite, calamine, willemite, franklinite,\r\netc., are secondary, resulting from modifications of the original\r\nsphalerite. In connection with zinc minerals the region of Franklin\r\nFurnace, N. J., is especially interesting, for at that place are found\r\ntwo large metamorphosed deposits containing a wide range of zinc\r\nminerals, several of which are not found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nZinc is soft and malleable, but is only slightly ductile, and has little\r\ntensile strength. It alloys with several metals, and in this form is\r\nmost useful today; three parts of copper to one of zinc making brass;\r\nfour or more parts of copper and one of zinc, making “gold foil”; copper\r\nand zinc (a little more zinc than copper) making “white metal”; three\r\nparts of copper to one of zinc and one of nickel making German silver;\r\netc. Zinc is also used in large quantities in galvanizing iron, sheets\r\nof iron being dipped into melted zinc and thus thinly coated. It is also\r\nused in batteries and a wide range of chemical industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSphalerite\r\nZnS\r\nPl. 19 & 20\r\n_zinc blende, black jack_\r\n\r\nOccurs in grains, in fibrous or layered masses, or in isometric\r\ncrystals; hardness 3.5; specific gravity 4; color yellow-brown to almost\r\nblack; streak light yellow to brownish; luster resinous to adamantine;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhen in crystals sphalerite occurs most commonly either in dodecahedrons\r\nor in tetrahedrons (hemihedral forms of the isometric octahedron). The\r\ncleavage is fairly good and parallel to the faces of the dodecahedron.\r\nThe difficulty usually is to get large enough crystalline masses to see\r\nthis cleavage clearly, but by examining the angles between the faces of\r\ncleavage pieces they will be found to be the same as those on a\r\ndodecahedron. When the mineral is pure, it has the color of resin, but\r\nsometimes it is reddish to red-brown, and then it is called “ruby zinc,”\r\nmore often it is dark brown due to the presence of iron as an impurity.\r\nThis is what the miners call “black-jack.” The presence of iron also\r\ntends to make the streak darker. The hardness, streak and cleavage will\r\nusually determine this mineral readily.\r\n\r\nSphalerite is the primary ore of zinc and is usually found in fissures\r\nand veins leading from masses of igneous rocks, or along the surface of\r\ncontact where igneous rocks like granite or lavas come against such\r\nmetamorphic rocks as gneisses, schists, or crystalline limestones. In\r\nthe region of Joplin, Mo., however, the sphalerite is of secondary\r\ncharacter, having been gathered by waters circulating through the\r\nlimestones, and deposited in them in irregular pockets. This Joplin\r\ndistrict has produced more zinc than any other in the world. The United\r\nStates annually produces about 25% of the world’s supply of this metal.\r\n\r\nSphalerite is always associated with galena, and such other minerals as\r\nargentite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, fluorite, quartz, calcite and barite,\r\nare very apt to be present. It will be found in almost every state,\r\nespecially in fissures and veins, and less frequently in cavities in\r\nlimestones.\r\n\r\n\r\nZincite\r\nZnO\r\nPl. 19 & 20\r\n_red zinc ore_\r\n\r\nUsually occurs massive, but may be found in crystals; hardness 4;\r\nspecific gravity 5.6; color deep red; streak orange; luster\r\nsubadamantine; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhen in crystals zincite forms in hexagonal prisms with hexagonal\r\npyramids on the ends. This is rather rare, most of the zincite being\r\nfound in massive form. The cleavage is parallel to the prism faces and\r\nperfect. The deep red color and orange streak are wholly characteristic.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is so common at Franklin Furnace, N. J., as to be an\r\nimportant ore, but it is very seldom found elsewhere. This district, as\r\nmentioned before, is a peculiar one for zinc minerals. The zinc beds are\r\nin a metamorphosed limestone, and into this are intruded numerous dikes\r\nof granite. Probably the zinc was originally present in the bed of\r\nlimestone as smithsonite, calamine and other secondary minerals of zinc.\r\nWhen intruded by the hot granite the smithsonite (carbonate) may well\r\nhave been altered to the oxide, zincite; while the calamine (hydrous\r\nsilicate) became the simple silicate, willemite.\r\n\r\n\r\nWillemite\r\nZnSiO₄\r\nPl. 20\r\n\r\nOccurs in masses or in crystals; hardness 5.5; specific gravity 4.1;\r\ncolor pale yellow when pure; luster resinous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWillemite is another of the minerals which are distinctively\r\ncharacteristic of Franklin Furnace, and found elsewhere very rarely. It\r\nis so common there as to be one of the principal ores, and mostly occurs\r\nin irregular masses, but is also found in crystals. These are hexagonal\r\nprisms, with a three-sided (rhombohedral) pyramid on the ends. The color\r\nwhen pure is whitish or greenish-yellow, but with small amounts of\r\nimpurities it may be flesh-red, grayish-white or yellowish-brown. When\r\nin crystals it is easily determined; but when massive it looks like\r\ncalamine, and can only be distinguished by placing a bit of the mineral\r\nin a closed tube and heating it, in which case calamine will give off\r\nwater vapor, while willemite will not.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is one of those resulting from metamorphic alteration and\r\nis derived from calamine, when the latter loses its water of\r\ncrystallization. It is common at Franklin Furnace, N. J., and also found\r\noccasionally elsewhere, as at Salida, Colo., and in Socorro Co., New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalamine\r\nZn₂(OH)₂·SiO₃\r\n\r\nOccurs as crystalline linings in cavities, or as botryoidal or\r\nstalactitic masses; hardness 5; specific gravity 3.4; colorless to\r\nwhite; luster vitreous.\r\n\r\nCalamine resembles both smithsonite and willemite when in\r\nnon-crystalline masses. From the smithsonite it is easily separated by\r\nthe fact that in nitric acid the smithsonite effervesces and the\r\ncalamine does not. From willemite it is harder to distinguish, but a\r\npiece may be placed in a closed tube and heated. If it is calamine water\r\nvapor will be given off, if willemite nothing happens. When calamine\r\noccurs in crystals these are orthorhombic and mostly tabular, and the\r\ncrystals are peculiar in that the two ends are terminated differently.\r\n\r\nBoth this and smithsonite are secondary minerals and usually occur\r\ntogether when zinc is found in limestones. It is abundant at Franklin\r\nFurnace and Sterling Hill, N. J., and also found at Phœnixville, Penn.,\r\nin Wythe Co., Va., and Granby, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmithsonite\r\nZnCO₃\r\nPl. 21\r\n_Dry bone_\r\n\r\nUsually occurs as incrustations, grains, earthy or compact masses, and\r\nas crystals; hardness 5; specific gravity 4.4; color white, yellow,\r\ngreenish or bluish; streak white; luster vitreous; transparent on thin\r\nedges.\r\n\r\nWhen pure this mineral is colorless, but, as it occurs, it is usually\r\nwhite, or tinged with some shade of yellow, green, or blue, but in all\r\ncases its streak is white. The crystals are rhombohedrons often with\r\nedges beveled or corners cut by other faces. It resembles calamine and\r\nwillemite, but is readily separated from either of these by the acid\r\ntest, for smithsonite effervesces when acid is placed on it.\r\n\r\nNext to sphalerite, smithsonite is the commonest of the zinc minerals.\r\nIt is a secondary mineral, resulting from the action of lime-charged\r\nwater acting on sphalerite, and so is likely to be found wherever zinc\r\nminerals occur in a limestone region. In the Wisconsin-Illinois-Iowa\r\ndistrict it serves as a minor ore of zinc, and is termed here “dry\r\nbone.” It is also found in the Missouri and Arkansas districts, and in\r\nEurope is an important ore for zinc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklinite\r\n(ZnMn)Fe₂O₄\r\nPl. 21\r\n\r\nOccurs in compact grains or masses, and in isometric octahedrons;\r\nhardness 6; specific gravity 5; color black; streak reddish-brown;\r\nluster metallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis is a mineral peculiar to the Franklin Furnace region, from which it\r\ngets its name. It looks like magnetite, but its reddish-brown streak and\r\nlack of magnetism distinguish it. When it occurs in octahedrons, the\r\nedges are rounded, while those of magnetite are sharp. It is a complex\r\nand variable oxide of zinc, iron and manganese, which has resulted from\r\nthe metamorphism of the beds in which it occurred probably being\r\noriginally something quite different.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Manganese Group\r\n\r\nThough manganese was known in the mineral pyrolusite in early times, it\r\nwas then thought to be magnetite or magnetic iron ore. It was not until\r\n1774 that it was isolated and recognized as a distinct element.\r\n\r\nManganese is one of the lesser elements in the crust of the earth,\r\nmaking less than .07 of one percent, but as an alloy with other metals,\r\nespecially iron, it has attained a considerable importance to man. It is\r\nused chiefly with iron, 20% of manganese making the alloy, spiegeleisen,\r\na combination which occurs in Nature in Germany, and from 20% to 80%\r\nmaking ferromanganese. These alloys are in great demand because they\r\nmake an especially tough steel essential in the manufacture of\r\nmunitions. The sources for manganese are the oxide ores, manganite,\r\npyrolusite and psilomelane, which have been formed as secondary\r\nminerals, as a result of the weathering of silicates which carry\r\nmanganese. They occur widely enough, but throughout the United States\r\nthe deposits are small, and this is one of the elements in which this\r\ncountry is not self-sufficient. The largest producer of manganese is\r\nRussia; however she consumes almost all of her output at home, and our\r\nsupply comes from the next largest producers, India, the Union of South\r\nAfrica, and the Gold Coast. A shift in trade may be expected when\r\nBrazil’s recently discovered ore body in Matto Grosso is brought into\r\nfull production. Besides being used as an alloy, manganese is employed\r\nin making paints and dyes, for clearing glass, and for some types of\r\nelectric batteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyrolusite\r\nMnO₂\r\n\r\nOccurs in earthy or fibrous masses; hardness 1-2; specific gravity 4.8;\r\ncolor black; streak black; luster dull; opaque.\r\n\r\nPyrolusite occurs in soft masses and incrustations, usually leaving a\r\nsooty mark on the fingers. Sometimes it seems to be in crystals, but\r\nthese are pseudomorphs which have the form of manganite, from which the\r\npyrolusite has formed as a result of the water having been driven from\r\nthe manganite. Frequently pyromorphite and manganite will be found\r\ntogether, and in some cases the outer part of a mass or crystal will be\r\npyrolusite, while the center is still manganite. Psilomelane is another\r\noxide of manganese with water and may appear very like pyrolusite, but\r\nboth manganite and psilomelane have much greater hardness than does\r\npyrolusite. If there is difficulty in deciding about pyrolusite, it may\r\nbe placed in a closed tube and heated. It will not be affected by the\r\nheat, while, under the same circumstances, both manganite and\r\npsilomelane will give off water vapor.\r\n\r\nPyrolusite usually occurs in black streaks or pockets in residual clays\r\nwhich have formed as a result of the decomposition of limestones. It may\r\nalso occur in dendritic forms in seams and crevices (see manganite). It\r\nis found in Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia, Arkansas, Colorado,\r\nCalifornia, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsilomelane\r\nMnO₂·H₂O\r\n\r\nOccurs in compact botryoidal or stalactitic masses; hardness 5-6;\r\nspecific gravity 4.2; color black; streak brownish-black; luster\r\nmetallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nPsilomelane is very like pyrolusite, and often occurs with it. It is\r\ndistinguished by its greater hardness, and the fact, that when heated in\r\na closed tube, it gives off water vapor. From manganite it is more\r\neasily distinguished, for it never occurs in crystals, while the\r\nmanganite is usually crystalline. This and pyrolusite are the principal\r\nores of manganese.\r\n\r\nWad is an impure form of psilomelane, having some iron oxide mixed with\r\nthe manganese oxide, usually limonite; or the impurity may take the form\r\nof a copper, cobalt, lithium or barium oxide.\r\n\r\nPsilomelane is found at Brandon, Vt., in Arkansas, Colorado, California,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nManganite\r\nMn₂O₃·H₂O\r\nPl. 22\r\n\r\nOccurs in prismatic crystals, or in columnar or fibrous masses; hardness\r\n4; specific gravity 4.4; color steel gray; streak reddish-black; luster\r\nsubmetallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis is the form taken by manganese oxide when it crystallizes in the\r\npresence of moisture, and pyrolusite frequently changes to manganite\r\nwhen exposed to moisture. The crystals are orthorhombic prisms, with\r\nstriated sides and the ends truncated. These prisms usually occur in\r\nbundles and give the mineral a fibrous appearance. Manganite is not hard\r\nto identify, the striations on the crystals and the streak being very\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nIn seams and tiny crevices this mineral, and often pyrolusite, grows in\r\na branching manner, resembling tree-like or “mossy” masses. This is\r\ntermed dendritic, and the growths of manganese minerals are called\r\ndendrites. One of the most curious of these is when the “mossy” growth\r\nis inclosed in chalcedony, making the so-called _moss agate_. These moss\r\nagates are abundant through the Rocky Mountains and are frequently cut\r\nfor semi-precious stones. The finest ones however come from India and\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nManganite is found in the Lake Superior region, Colorado, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nRhodochrosite\r\nMnCO₃\r\n\r\nOccurs in compact cleavable masses; hardness 4; specific gravity 3.5;\r\ncolor rose to dark red; streak white; luster vitreous; translucent on\r\nthin edges.\r\n\r\nThis usually occurs in pink to red masses which cleave readily parallel\r\nto the faces of the rhombohedron. When it is found in crystals, which\r\nare rare, these too are rhombohedrons. It is usually found in veins as a\r\ngangue mineral with copper, silver or zinc ores. Its beautiful color and\r\nthe fact that it effervesces in acid serve to distinguish this mineral.\r\nIt is found at Branchville, Conn., at Franklin Furnace, N. J., and in\r\nveins with silver in Colorado, Nevada, and Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Aluminum Group\r\n\r\nThough aluminum is one of the most abundant of all the metals, making\r\nsome 8% of the crust of the earth, its union with other elements is so\r\nfirm, that only recently have methods been found for getting the metal\r\nfree. It was first isolated in 1846, but up to 1890 the extraction of\r\naluminum was so expensive, that it could not be widely used. About that\r\ntime electrical processes were applied to its extraction, and since then\r\nthe price has steadily dropped, until now it is under $.20 per pound. It\r\nis very malleable, and ductile, and has high tensile strength. Exposed\r\nto the air, water or ordinary gases, it does not tarnish; and it is very\r\nlight, an equal bulk weighing about a third as much as iron. The\r\ncombination of lightness and strength, and the fact that it is a good\r\nconductor of electricity, have made it available for a wide range of\r\nuses, such as electrical apparatus, delicate instruments, boats,\r\naeroplanes, and domestic utensils.\r\n\r\nIt is an essential component of all the important rocks, except\r\nsandstone and limestone, and combines to a greater or less degree in a\r\nhost of minerals. Though present in clays, shales, argillites,\r\nfeldspars, and micas, it is only from bauxite that it has been\r\nsuccessfully extracted. Aside from the small number of simple compounds\r\nof aluminum grouped here, it also takes a part in the make-up of a large\r\nseries of minerals termed silicates, treated a little further on in this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nIt alloys with other metals, especially copper. The union of copper and\r\na small amount of aluminum makes aluminum-bronze, which looks like gold\r\nand is used for watch chains, pencil-cases, etc., and also for the\r\nantifriction bearings of heavy machinery. A small amount added to steel\r\nprevents air holes and cracks in casting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorundum\r\nAl₂O₃\r\nPl. 23\r\n\r\nOccurs in cleavable masses or in hexagonal crystals; hardness 9;\r\nspecific gravity 4; colorless, red, yellow, blue, or gray; luster\r\nvitreous to adamantine; translucent to transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nCorundum is readily recognized by its hardness, second only to that of\r\nthe diamond. The crystals may be simple six-sided prisms, hexagonal\r\npyramids or combinations of the two. The cleavage is usually described\r\nas parting, for it is by no means perfect, but when it is recognizable\r\nit is parallel to the faces of a rhombohedron, and cleavage pieces may\r\nappear almost cubic.\r\n\r\nWhen in clear and perfect crystals this mineral is one of the most\r\nhighly prized of all the gems. Clear and colorless it is known as the\r\n“_Oriental white sapphire_”; when tinged with blue it is the _sapphire_;\r\nwhen colored yellow, the “_Oriental topaz_”; when green, the “_Oriental\r\nemerald_”; when purple, the “_Oriental amethyst_” and when red, the\r\n_ruby_. Sapphires range from colorless to deep blue, the value depending\r\non the shade of the blue, and increasing as the color deepens. The\r\nOriental topaz can easily be confused with the true topaz, which is a\r\nmuch commoner and less valuable gem, but can be distinguished by the\r\nhardness, topaz having a hardness of but 8. The name emerald is applied\r\nto several green gems, mostly to beryl, which is not so hard and is the\r\ntrue emerald. The Oriental emeralds have a value about the same as\r\ndiamonds. Rubies of clear and deep color are the rarest of all gems,\r\nranging in value about three times as high as diamonds of equal size.\r\nThe most sought-for shade is the so-called “pigeon-blood red,” and the\r\nvalue of a stone of this sort is almost dependent on the whim of the\r\nbuyer. The best of the rubies come from granites or metamorphosed\r\nlimestones in Burma; the best sapphires from Ceylon, though both of\r\nthese, and some of the other corundums of gem quality, have been found\r\nin North Carolina and Montana.\r\n\r\nAround these stones, which have been used so long among the Hindus,\r\nPersians, Jews, Egyptians, and Christians, a wealth of lore has been\r\nwoven. The sapphire was Saturn’s stone, and a talisman to attract Divine\r\nfavor. Where tradition makes the stone on which the ten commandments\r\nwere written the sapphire, it is probable that, what was really meant,\r\nis lapis lazuli, as is also the case when sapphires are mentioned as\r\nbuilding stones for the celestial gates. The ruby in ancient lore is\r\ntermed “lord of stones,” “gem of gems” etc., and so protected its wearer\r\nthat he was safe from injury in peace or war.\r\n\r\nWhen corundum is colored brown by impurities of iron, it is termed\r\n_corundum_, when black by greater quantities of iron, it is _emery_.\r\nThese varieties are far the commonest form in which corundum occurs, and\r\nwhen ground to finer or coarser powder make the commercial emery. Emery\r\nis likely to be found in sands, making so-called “black sands,” where it\r\nhas accumulated as a result of the weathering to bits corundum-bearing\r\nrocks. In some one of its forms, corundum is found in Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, and all down the Appalachian\r\nMountains, also in Colorado, Montana, California, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nBauxite\r\nAl₂O₃·2H₂O\r\n\r\nOccurs in grains, or oolitic or clay-like masses; hardness 1-3; specific\r\ngravity 2.5; color white to yellowish-white or reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nBauxite never comes in crystals, but is usually in earthy masses, which\r\nhave resulted from the decomposition of granitic or volcanic rocks, in\r\ncircumstances where hot alkaline waters were present. This explanation\r\nseems to apply especially to the deposits in France, which were first\r\nthe chief source of the bauxite, and may be applicable to those in\r\nGeorgia and Alabama. Some of the other deposits, however, do not seem to\r\nhave had any hot water available, and the deposit appears more like\r\nsimple decomposition of the underlying rocks by alkaline waters.\r\n\r\nIn many cases bauxite resembles limonite in being a mixture of two or\r\nmore aluminum oxides with water of crystallization, such as Al₂O₃·H₂O,\r\nAl₂O₃·2H₂O and Al₂O₃·3H₂O. This is particularly true of the bauxite\r\nwhich resulted from the decomposition of rocks by surface water.\r\n\r\nBauxite is the ore from which aluminum is obtained. The deposits are not\r\nlarge, but the United States has its share of them. It is found in\r\nAlabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee, and California.\r\n\r\n\r\nCryolite\r\nNa₃AlF₆\r\n_Ice stone_\r\n\r\nOccurs in pseudo-cubic crystals or massive; hardness 2.5; specific\r\ngravity 3; color white; luster vitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nCryolite is a relatively soft mineral, colorless to white as snow; for\r\nwhich reason, and partly also because it comes mostly from Greenland it\r\nis called “ice stone.” It is really monoclinic but the inclination of\r\nthe c axis is so slight, that, unless examined carefully, the crystals\r\nappear to be cubic. Until about 1900 great quantities of this mineral\r\nwere shipped from West Greenland, and from them the metal aluminum was\r\nextracted. When bauxite was discovered, it was found to be considerably\r\ncheaper to make the aluminum from that mineral, and now cryolite is no\r\nlonger sought. Aside from its occurrence in Greenland some cryolite is\r\nfound in Colorado, near Pike’s Peak.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Arsenic Group\r\n\r\nThe metal, arsenic, is a dark steel gray in color, when the surface is\r\nfresh, but it soon tarnishes. It is very brittle and easily powdered\r\nunder the hammer, and its only use as a metal, is for an alloy with lead\r\nin making shot. Its compounds find a wider use. The white powder called\r\n“arsenic” is arsenous acid, and is used mostly in making poisons, which\r\nfortunately are easily detected in animal tissues. Copper arsenate,\r\n(_Scheele’s green_) is a pigment used in making green paint, and\r\nformerly in the green colors of wall paper. A combination of arsenous\r\nacid, copper oxide and acetic acid is the well known _Paris Green_, so\r\nmuch used for an insecticide. Beside these uses, arsenic serves a large\r\nnumber of other purposes, as in making glass and enamel, embalming\r\nfluids, and various medicines.\r\n\r\nCuriously arsenic plays a double part, acting part of the time as a\r\nmetal, as in the two following minerals, and part of the time as a\r\nnon-metal, as in cobaltite, niccolite, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nArsenopyrite\r\nFeAsS\r\nPl. 24\r\n\r\nOccurs in well formed crystals, grains, or masses; hardness 5.5;\r\nspecific gravity 6; color silver-white; streak black; luster metallic;\r\nopaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhen in crystals, they are usually short prisms of the orthorhombic\r\nsystem, either end being terminated with a low roof. Though usually\r\ndescribed as silver-white in color, there is always a brassy cast to the\r\ncolor. Its appearance is much like cobaltite and smaltite, but it can be\r\neasily distinguished from both these by putting a piece in nitric acid.\r\nThe arsenopyrite will not materially change the color of the fluid, but\r\nthe other two turn it rose-red, and all give off the smell of sulphur.\r\nIt looks sometimes like marcasite, but that is yellower, and has the\r\nfibrous structure, not found in arsenopyrite.\r\n\r\nIt is found in veins or in metamorphic rocks, associated with argentite,\r\ngalena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and pyrite. It is distinctly a mineral\r\nformed by deposition from hot vapors or hot water rising from either\r\nlavas, or in the course of metamorphism.\r\n\r\nIt is found in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New\r\nYork, New Jersey, California, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nRealgar\r\nAsS\r\nPl. 24\r\n\r\nOccurs in incrustations or scattered grains; hardness 1.5 to 2; specific\r\ngravity 3.5; color orange; streak orange; luster resinous; opaque on\r\nthin edges.\r\n\r\nCrystals are very rare, but when found are short monoclinic prisms. The\r\ncolor is aurora-red, changing to orange as soon as it is exposed to the\r\nair. This and the streak are entirely characteristic. It is a mineral\r\nassociated with hot vapors or hot waters, and is found about volcanoes,\r\nas deposits from the hot water of the geysers in Norris Basin,\r\nYellowstone Park, and in veins, associated with barite, stibnite,\r\nquartz, etc., as in Massachusetts, Utah, California, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrpiment\r\nAs₂S₃\r\n\r\nOccurs as incrustations or powdery masses; hardness 1 to 2; specific\r\ngravity 3.5; color lemon yellow; streak yellow; luster resinous.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is very like realgar in its physical properties, and likely\r\nto occur with it. It gives the lemon yellow color to the basins about\r\nhot springs, as in the Yellowstone Park, and about volcanoes. It also\r\ncomes in veins with realgar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Molybdenum\r\n\r\nMolybdenum is a rare metal, silvery-white in color, brittle and very\r\ndifficult to fuse. It is used mostly as an alloy of steel, to make\r\ncertain grades of tool steel. The world’s greatest supply is obtained\r\nfrom Climax, Colorado, where the principal ore mineral is molybdenite.\r\n\r\n\r\nMolybdenite\r\nMoS₂\r\n\r\nOccurs in scales or scaly masses, occasionally in tabular hexagonal\r\ncrystals; hardness 1.5; specific gravity 4.7; color lead-gray; streak\r\nbluish-gray; luster metallic; opaque.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is the chief source for the metal molybdenum. Its extreme\r\nsoftness and greasy feel will distinguish it at once from any other\r\nmineral except graphite, which has much the same qualities, but its\r\nscaly character and the more bluish tinge in streak and color will\r\ndistinguish these two.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in granites, gneisses, and metamorphic rocks in Colorado, New\r\nMexico, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Antimony\r\n\r\nAntimony is another hard, brittle metal, of bluish-white color. Exposed\r\nto the air at ordinary temperatures it does not tarnish; and this\r\ncombined with its hardness make it useful for such alloys as Britannia\r\nmetal, type metal, and pewter. Only one of its minerals, stibnite, is\r\ncommon enough for mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nStibnite\r\nSb₂S₃\r\nPl. 25\r\n_gray antimony_\r\n\r\nOccurs in prismatic or needle-like crystals; hardness 2; specific\r\ngravity 4.5; color lead-gray; streak lead-gray; luster metallic; opaque.\r\n\r\nThe crystals of stibnite are orthorhombic and usually elongated, the\r\nsides striated and the ends with low pyramids on them. Sometimes the\r\nlong crystals are curved or even twisted. There is a well-developed\r\ncleavage parallel to face b in the figure. While the color is similar to\r\nthat of galena, the form and cleavage are so different that stibnite is\r\neasily determined.\r\n\r\nThe ancients used stibnite to color their eyebrows, now it is the source\r\nfor the metal antimony. Hungary and Japan are famous for the fine large\r\ncrystals they produce; but moderate sized crystals may be found in this\r\ncountry. It occurs in veins along with pyrite, galena, cinnabar, and\r\nrealgar, with quartz, calcite or barite as gangue minerals.\r\n\r\nStibnite has been found in Arkansas, California, Nevada, and Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Nickel Group\r\n\r\nNickel as a metal is silvery-white in color, rather hard, and does not\r\ntarnish when exposed to the air. When pure it is malleable and fairly\r\nductile. It is highly useful for plating other metals to protect their\r\nsurfaces. Alloyed with steel, it makes a product of extreme hardness.\r\nCopper, zinc, and nickel make the well known German silver.\r\n\r\nNickel has a fairly large range of minerals, but they do not occur with\r\nany abundance in the United States, so that we have to import most all\r\nof our nickel. In the earlier days New Caledonia produced most of the\r\nworld’s supply, but recently since the finding of large nickel deposits\r\nnear Sudbury, Canada, this locality has not only outstripped New\r\nCaledonia, but now produces four-fifths of the world’s supply. In this\r\ncountry but two nickel minerals will be found at all common.\r\n\r\n\r\nNiccolite\r\nNiAs\r\nPl. 25\r\n_copper nickel_\r\n\r\nOccurs in masses; hardness 5.5; specific gravity 7.4; color pale\r\ncoppery-yellow; streak pale brownish-black; luster metallic; opaque on\r\nthin edges.\r\n\r\nNiccolite is very seldom in crystals, but if they do occur they are\r\nhexagonal. The mineral looks a little like smaltite, but in case there\r\nis any question of the determination, dissolve a piece in nitric acid,\r\nand if niccolite, it will color the solution green.\r\n\r\nNiccolite is usually associated with copper and silver ores, and in this\r\ncountry has been found at Chatham, Conn., and Silver Cliff, Colo. It may\r\nbe associated with pentlandite, a sulphide of iron and nickel, which is\r\nsimilar in appearance, but not so hard, and occurs in small grains\r\nthroughout dark lavas. The particles of pentlandite are however so\r\nsmall, that they are seldom noticeable, but at Sudbury, Canada, this is\r\nthe chief ore of nickel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMillerite\r\nNiS\r\n_capillary pyrites_\r\n\r\nOccurs in needle-like or fibrous crystals; hardness 3.5; specific\r\ngravity 5.5; color brass-yellow; streak greenish black; luster metallic;\r\nopaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous crystals of millerite belong to the orthorhombic system. The\r\ncolor and streak suggest pyrite, but the crystals are long and slender,\r\nwhile pyrite is in cubes, octahedrons, etc. If there is any doubt of the\r\nidentity of this form, place a piece in nitric acid, and if it is\r\nmillerite, it will color the acid green.\r\n\r\nIt may occur in veins associated with cobalt and silver minerals, or as\r\na secondary mineral as at Gap Mine, Penn., or in cavities in sedimentary\r\nrocks. In the last case it usually is in needle-like crystals growing\r\nthrough calcite crystals, as at St. Louis, Mo., Keokuk, Iowa, and\r\nAntwerp, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Cobalt Group\r\n\r\nAs a metal, cobalt is hard, brittle, and of a grayish color, tinged with\r\nred. It was not recognized as a separate element until 1735, and even\r\ntoday is one of the minor metals. Cobalt, chromium and a little tungsten\r\nmake the alloy stellite, which has come into large use in making\r\nhigh-speed tools. The oxide of cobalt (CoO) is “smalt,” used to give the\r\nblue color to porcelain, pottery, glass, tiles, etc. Invisible ink is\r\nmade by diluting cobalt chloride in a large quantity of water. This\r\nsolution is a faint pink color and practically invisible on paper, but\r\nif heated it loses water and turns blue in color, and is perfectly\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nCobalt is another of the metals, of which the United States does not\r\nhave an adequate supply. Sweden, Norway and India were the chief sources\r\nof supply until cobalt was found near the town of Cobalt in Ontario,\r\nCanada, and now this district furnishes 90% of the world’s supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nCobaltite\r\nCoAsS\r\nPl. 26\r\n_cobalt glance_\r\n\r\nUsually crystalline in cubes, pyritohedrons or octahedrons; hardness\r\n5.5; specific gravity 6.1; color reddish silver-white; streak\r\ngrayish-black; luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nIn color cobaltite may appear very like arsenopyrite, especially if the\r\nreddish tinge is not strong, in which case the mineral can be definitely\r\ndetermined by putting a piece in nitric acid. If it is cobaltite the\r\nsolution will be colored rose-red, if arsenopyrite there will be no\r\nchange of color. The forms of the crystals are the same as those of\r\npyrite, but the color will easily distinguish cobaltite from pyrite.\r\nThis pink color is characteristically present either in or about cobalt\r\nminerals, being sometimes called “cobalt bloom.” It is a\r\ncobalt-arsenic-oxide with water of crystallization (Co₃As₂O₈·8H₂O),\r\nwhich results from the exposure of cobalt and arsenic minerals to air\r\nand moisture. It is the pink color on the figures of both cobaltite and\r\nsmaltite. In Sweden, Norway and India, this is the chief ore for cobalt,\r\nbut in the United States it is rather rare, but is found in Oregon, and\r\nat Cobalt, Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmaltite\r\n(CoNi)As₂\r\nPl. 26\r\n_gray cobalt ore_\r\n\r\nUsually occurs in masses; hardness 5.5; specific gravity 6.2; color\r\ntin-white to steel-gray; streak grayish-black; luster metallic; opaque\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhile very like cobaltite, smaltite is almost never found in crystals,\r\nbut when crystals are found, they are cubes. The color is tin-white but\r\nthere is usually a pink tinge visible due to the presence of small\r\namounts of “cobalt bloom.” If in any doubt about the determination of\r\nthis mineral, put a piece in nitric acid. If it colors the acid\r\nrose-pink, and is non-crystalline it is pretty surely smaltite; if the\r\nacid is not affected it is arsenopyrite.\r\n\r\nSmaltite is found in Kentucky, Missouri, Colorado, Idaho, California,\r\nand at Cobalt in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Chromium\r\n\r\nThis metal gets its name in recognition of the many colors (_chroma_\r\n“color”), in which its compounds appear. Chromic oxide is a vivid green,\r\nused to color porcelains, pottery, tiles, etc., and also as a substitute\r\nfor the arsenical greens formerly used in wall-paper. The chromate of\r\nlead is the pigment, well known to artists as “chrome yellow,” and the\r\nbichromate of potassium is bright red. The metal is obtained in at least\r\ntwo different forms; one hard, brittle and so resistant to heat as to be\r\ninfusible at temperatures which would volatilize platinum; the other as\r\na powder which burns brightly if heated in air. While used in paints,\r\ndyes, etc., its greatest importance is for the making of ferro-chrome\r\nsteel, which is used where resistance to sudden shock is required, as in\r\narmor plate, automobile springs, ball bearings, etc. With tungsten and\r\ncobalt it makes the alloy, stellite, as noted above.\r\n\r\nChromium was used in relatively small quantities before the first world\r\nwar, and we imported our supplies from Turkey, India, New Caledonia, and\r\nRhodesia. During the last war we started a large-scale development of\r\nlow-grade ores in Montana, and can now supply all of our needs from this\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n\r\nChromite\r\nFeCr₂O₄\r\n_chromic iron_\r\n\r\nOccurs in grains, masses, or isometric octahedrons; hardness 5.5;\r\nspecific gravity 4.4; color black; streak dark-brown; luster\r\nsubmetallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nIn form, color and streak chromite resembles magnetite and franklinite.\r\nFrom the magnetite it is distinguished by being non-magnetic; from the\r\nfranklinite, by being insoluble in hydrochloric acid, while the\r\nfranklinite is soluble. Chromite furnishes practically all the chromium\r\nused in the arts and manufactures. It is a mineral associated with high\r\ntemperatures, and therefore found in dark lavas, serpentine, and\r\nolivine. It occurs in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Montana,\r\nOregon, Wyoming, and California.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Tungsten\r\n\r\nThis element is obtained either as a heavy dark-gray metal, which is\r\nvery hard and difficult to fuse, or as a dark-gray powder. It is used as\r\nan alloy with iron, one part of tungsten to nine of steel, to make the\r\nferrotungsten, which has extraordinary hardness, and is used mostly for\r\nhigh-speed tools. Tungsten is also one of the three metals (cobalt,\r\nchromium and tungsten) which are alloyed together to make stellite. Some\r\nof the tungsten supply is also used to make the films in incandescent\r\nlamps, and in some of the chemical industries. It has but one important\r\nore, wolframite, and this is found in the United States in but small\r\nquantities; so that we ordinarily have to import the greater part of\r\nwhat we use. During the last war, under the stimulus of high prices and\r\nthe urge of necessity, we did find and produce substantial quantities of\r\ntungsten. China is the world’s largest producer of tungsten ore with\r\nBurma second, and the United States a poor third.\r\n\r\n\r\nWolframite\r\n(FeMn)WO₄\r\n\r\nOccurs in monoclinic crystals or in crystalline masses; hardness 5.5;\r\nspecific gravity 7.4; color dark-brown to black; streak nearly black;\r\nluster submetallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nIf in crystals the form will serve to distinguish this mineral from\r\ncassiterite and ilmenite, the two which it most resembles; but if it is\r\nmassive the only sure way to decide is to put a piece in strong\r\nsulphuric acid; if it dissolves and throws down a yellow precipitate\r\n(tungstic acid) it is wolframite.\r\n\r\nLike the two other minerals mentioned above it occurs in veins in\r\nigneous rocks, being associated with high temperatures. As it is almost\r\ninsoluble in water, like cassiterite and ilmenite, it is likely to occur\r\nwith them in the sands which are the result of the disintegration of the\r\nrocks which carried the minerals; and so a large part of the supply\r\ntoday comes from placer deposits.\r\n\r\nIt is found in Connecticut, North Carolina, Missouri, Colorado, and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Radium, Uranium and Vanadium\r\n\r\nThese three metals are all rare and occur together. Radium, discovered\r\nin 1898, is a heavy metal which has proved very useful because of its\r\nradio-activity, that is, its power of giving off or radiating tiny\r\nparticles of matter known as _X-rays_, part of which are charged with\r\npositive electricity, and part of them with negative electricity. The\r\nability of these rays to pass through other substances has made possible\r\nphotographing the denser substances within those less dense, as the\r\nbones within the flesh, or metal within leather or wood, etc. The rays\r\nhave proved of great value medicinally, and are also used to make\r\nobjects luminous in the dark. These X-rays are also used in the study of\r\nthe ultimate structure of matter, as it can be thus obtained in such\r\nsmall units.\r\n\r\nUranium is another element which is radio-active and can be used for\r\nmany of the same purposes as radium.\r\n\r\nVanadium, the third of these associated metals, and the commonest of the\r\ngroup, is not radio-active. It is a silvery-white metal, mostly used as\r\nan alloy with steel to give it great hardness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarnotite\r\nK₂O·2U₂O₃·V₂O₅·3H₂O\r\nPl. 27\r\n\r\nOccurs in earthy masses; color yellow.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is included here, not because it is common, but because it\r\nis of such great interest. It is the chief source of supply in the\r\nUnited States of radium, uranium and vanadium. It is a lemon-yellow\r\nearth or powder, which looks a little like orpiment. It is however found\r\nin a sandstone, instead of where hot waters have deposed minerals. From\r\na ton of this ore about 10 pounds of uranium oxide, 55 pounds of\r\nvanadium and ¹/₁₀₀₀th of a gram of radium are obtained. Carnotite is\r\nfound in south-west Colorado and south-east Utah, and on Carrizo\r\nMountain on the line between Arizona and New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Mercury\r\n\r\nMercury, or quicksilver, is the only metal which is liquid at ordinary\r\ntemperatures. It is silvery-white in color, with a striking metallic\r\nluster, and at the low temperature of 662° F., boils and changes to a\r\ncolorless vapor. Mercury alloys with certain metals, these alloys being\r\nknown as amalgams. In this way it is especially useful for the recovery\r\nof gold and silver, the mercury being added to crushed ore, the gold or\r\nsilver uniting with the mercury in a liquid amalgam, which is then drawn\r\noff and heated to a temperature above 662° F., at which temperature the\r\nmercury volatilizes and is recovered, while the gold or silver remains\r\nbehind. Mercury also forms a solid amalgam with tin which is used to\r\ncoat glass, the high metallic luster making the most effective looking\r\nglass. It is also used in medicines (calomel, corrosive sublimate,\r\netc.), for scientific instruments (thermometers, barometers, etc.), in\r\ncosmetics, in paints for ship bottoms, etc.\r\n\r\nThough there are some 25 minerals of mercury, only one is common or\r\nimportant as a source of the metal, cinnabar. The United States is\r\nself-sufficient as far as mercury is concerned, producing just about as\r\nmuch as it uses. The leading producers are Spain, Austria, Italy, and\r\nthe United States. Commercially mercury is quoted as quicksilver, and in\r\nflasks of 75 pounds each.\r\n\r\n\r\nCinnabar\r\nHgS\r\nPl. 27\r\n\r\nOccurs in massive or earthy form, or in minute crystals in cavities;\r\nhardness 2.5; specific gravity 8; color scarlet to dark red; streak\r\nvermilion; luster adamantine; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThe bright-red color and the streak are usually enough to identify this\r\nmineral at once, but some of the darker varieties resemble hematite or\r\nzincite in appearance, but both these have much greater hardness. When\r\nin crystals they are tiny hexagonal prisms with pyramids on the end.\r\nCinnabar is usually found in or near metamorphic or igneous rocks,\r\neither in veins leading from the igneous rocks, or in metamorphic rocks,\r\nor it may occur disseminated through metamorphic rocks. It is associated\r\nwith quartz or calcite, and may occur with other sulphides like pyrite,\r\ngalena, argentite, etc. It is most abundant in California, but is also\r\nfound in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas, and\r\nMontana.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Tin\r\n\r\nTin has been known since early Roman times, and the mines at Cornwall,\r\nEngland, were worked from that time all through down to the present, but\r\nnow they are becoming of minor importance as they approach exhaustion.\r\nThe metal is silvery-white, does not easily tarnish, is malleable, but\r\nhas little ductility and little tensile strength. Tin is mostly used in\r\nmaking tin plate, a thin sheet of steel covered with tin, the tin being\r\nonly 1 to 2% of the total weight. This tin plate is mostly made into tin\r\ncans, and used as containers for food. Some tin is used in making\r\nsolder, tin-foil, tubes for paste, vaseline, etc., and around 1000 tons\r\nper year for weighting silk. This “weighting” makes the silk heavier by\r\nabout 25% and gives it a “rustle,” which, while much in evidence, is\r\nreally indicative that the silk is not pure. The United States produces\r\nvery little tin, most of the world’s supply coming from the Malay\r\nPeninsula, Dutch East Indies, China, and Bolivia, with small amounts\r\nfrom several other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCassiterite\r\nSnO₂\r\nPl. 28\r\n_tin stone_\r\n\r\nOccurs in tetragonal crystals, massive, or in grains and pebbles;\r\nhardness 6.5; specific gravity 7; color black or dark-brown; streak\r\ngray; luster adamantine; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThe crystals are short prisms with pyramidal ends. Twinning is common.\r\nCassiterite also occurs in fibrous masses, and when it is weathered from\r\nits original location, is so insoluble and hard, that it remains as\r\ngrains and pebbles, making placer-deposits, from which today three\r\nquarters of the supply is obtained. If pure, the crystals would be\r\ncolorless, but impurities of iron and titanium give it the dark-brown to\r\nblack color. Cassiterite may appear very like rutile, the crystalline\r\nforms being identical, but the reddish tinge of color in the rutile will\r\nseparate the two.\r\n\r\nCassiterite is one of those minerals which result from deposition at\r\nvery high temperatures, probably from vapors, and is found in the veins\r\nin igneous rocks, such as light-colored granites, gneisses, syenites,\r\netc. While not mined in this country it is found in small quantities in\r\nMaine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Virginia, Alabama, Wyoming,\r\nMontana, and California.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Titanium\r\n\r\nTitanium, as a metal, is a heavy, gray, iron-like powder, which is\r\nchiefly useful as an alloy with iron, giving it toughness, and\r\npreventing bubbles and cracks in casting. It is not as rare as some\r\nother metals which have found a wider use.\r\n\r\n\r\nRutile\r\nTiO₂\r\nPl. 28\r\n\r\nOccurs in tetragonal crystals, and in grains; hardness 6.5; specific\r\ngravity 4.2; color red to reddish-brown; streak yellowish-brown; luster\r\nmetallic to adamantine; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nRutile usually occurs in crystals, which are either short and stout, or\r\nin needle-like crystals. Twinning is common. In form and general\r\nappearance it resembles cassiterite, but the reddish color, and the\r\nyellowish-brown streak will distinguish the rutile. It is found in\r\nsimilar rocks, granites, gneisses, syenites, and mica-schists, the two\r\nminerals cassiterite and rutile often occurring together. This is also\r\ntrue of the grains, which have been weathered out and are found in sands\r\nand gravels of placer deposits. It is found in small quantities in all\r\nthe New England States, New York, and all down the Appalachian\r\nMountains, especially at Graves Mountain, Ga., and in Arkansas and\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\n\r\nIlmenite\r\nFeTiO₃\r\n\r\nOccurs in granular masses, as black sand, or as tabular hexagonal\r\ncrystals; hardness 5-6; specific gravity 4.7; color black; streak\r\nbrownish-red to black; luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhen ilmenite occurs in crystals they are tabular and resemble hematite\r\nin its darker varieties, but the streak readily distinguishes the two.\r\nIn masses it looks like magnetite, but the lack of magnetism serves to\r\ndistinguish these two minerals. It is very likely to be associated with\r\ncassiterite, rutile, or magnetite in grains which have weathered out of\r\nthe original rock, and have resisted solution and wear. Sands with a\r\nlarge amount of the above mentioned minerals are termed “black sands,”\r\nsome of which are important for one or another of these minerals.\r\n\r\nIlmenite is a mineral formed at high temperatures, and probably often\r\ndeposited from hot vapors. It is found in granites, syenites, and\r\ngneisses. Among the better known localities are Orange, N. Y.,\r\nLitchfield, Conn., Florida, California, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Platinum\r\n\r\nThis metal is steel-gray in color, very malleable and ductile, almost\r\ninfusible and resists the action of acids. It is one of the “noble”\r\nmetals, much rarer than gold, and so has become popular for jewelry. It\r\nis also used in the manufacture of sulphuric-acid, in nitrogen-fixation\r\nplants, for chemical utensils, in the electrical industries, and in\r\ndentistry. Platinum in its occurrence is associated with the certain\r\nother equally rare elements, like iridium, palladium and osmium. Its use\r\nhas increased rapidly of late, but the supply has not kept up with the\r\ndemand, so that, whereas in 1906 platinum and gold were about equally\r\nvaluable, now the platinum brings about five times as much as the gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlatinum\r\nPt\r\n\r\nOccurs in grains or nuggets; hardness 4.5; specific gravity 19 (21 if\r\npure); color steel-gray; luster metallic; opaque.\r\n\r\nThis rare metal is mostly found in placer-deposits, often with gold. It\r\ncomes originally from dark igneous rocks, like peridotite, pyroxenite,\r\netc., and platinum is found to be associated with the nickel ores of\r\nSudbury, Canada. While formerly 90% of the world’s supply of platinum\r\ncame from placer mines in the Ural Mountains, today more than half is\r\nproduced in Canada and about a fifth in Russia. In the United States it\r\nis found in California, Oregon, Nevada, and Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Magnesium Group\r\n\r\nMagnesium is a silvery-white metal, easily tarnished by exposure to\r\nmoist air. Because of its light weight, less than twice the weight of\r\nwater, and strength, it is being substituted for aluminum, especially in\r\nairplanes, where the question of weight is crucial. It is also used in\r\nautomobile and ship production and other machine industries, and in the\r\nmanufacture of flares and incendiary bombs. Magnesium is obtained\r\nchiefly from magnesite, dolomite, and in the United States as a result\r\nof a recently developed process, from sea water. Magnesium has a\r\nconsiderable number of minerals, of which three are taken up here and\r\nseveral more under the head of silicates, where both magnesium and\r\nsilicon are combined in a mineral.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpinel\r\nMgAlO₄\r\nPl. 29\r\n\r\nOccurs mostly as isometric octahedrons; hardness 8; specific gravity\r\n3.5; color, red, yellow, green, or black; streak white; luster vitreous;\r\ntransparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather rare mineral, but, when in clear crystals is considered\r\none of the gems. It was early confused with corundum, and the red\r\nvariety called ruby, as it was found in the same gem-bearing sands in\r\nCeylon, Burma, and Siam. However the form of the isometric octahedron as\r\ncompared with the hexagonal prism of the corundum, together with the\r\nlesser hardness are sufficient to distinguish the two easily. The\r\ncrystals are usually octahedrons, but may have the corners cut or the\r\nedges beveled. Twins are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe standard color is a clear deep-red, and such a spinel is known in\r\nthe gem trade as a _spinel-ruby_. If the color is rose-red, it is a\r\n_Balas ruby_; if orange, it is _rubicelle_, if of a violet tinge,\r\n_almandine_. When small quantities of other elements replace the\r\nmagnesium, the color is greatly changed. For example a little iron\r\npresent gives the crystals a dark-green to black color, and the spinel\r\nis known as _ceylonite_. If there is both iron and chromium present, the\r\ncolor becomes yellowish or greenish-brown, and this variety is\r\n_picotite_. When the impurities are iron and copper, the color becomes\r\ngrass-green, and it is called _chlorospinel_. A form, in which the\r\nmagnesium is completely replaced by iron, is black in color and termed\r\n_hercynite_, and occurs fairly abundantly in Westchester Co., N. Y. From\r\nAmity, N. Y., to Andover, N. J., there is a belt of granular limestone\r\nin which spinel of all colors is found. St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., is also\r\na rich locality. Bolton, Mass., Newton, Sterling, and Sparta, N. J.,\r\nNorth Carolina, Alabama, and California all yield spinel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnesite\r\nMgCO₃\r\n\r\nOccurs in cleavable or compact porcelain-like masses; hardness 4;\r\nspecific gravity 3.1; color white to gray; luster vitreous; translucent\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nMagnesite is white and brittle, and cleaves perfectly parallel to the\r\nfaces of the rhombohedron, but it seldom occurs in crystals. It will\r\neffervesce in warm hydrochloric acid and has some resemblance to\r\ncalcite, but can be distinguished by the greater hardness. It is still\r\nmore like dolomite, both having the same color and cleavage, both\r\neffervescing in warm hydrochloric acid; but the magnesite has half a\r\npoint greater hardness and the porcelainous appearance. Magnesite is\r\nused in toilet preparations, paper making, and mixed with asbestos, as a\r\ncovering for heating pipes.\r\n\r\nMagnesite is found in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, and in large\r\ndeposits in California and Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nDolomite\r\n(MgCa)CO₃\r\nPl. 19 & 29\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals, or in cleavable or granular masses; hardness 3.5;\r\nspecific gravity 2.8; color white to pink or gray; streak white; luster\r\nvitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nDolomite crystallizes in the hexagonal system, in rhombohedrons\r\n(hemihedral form), which are more or less modified by faces on the\r\ncorners or edges. The cleavage is parallel to the rhombohedron, and it\r\nwill effervesce in warm hydrochloric acid. Sometimes the crystal faces\r\nare curved, and when this is the case, dolomite is easily determined.\r\nUsually however dolomite resembles both calcite and magnesite. From the\r\ncalcite it is distinguished by the greater hardness, and from magnesite\r\nby lesser hardness and not being porcelainous in appearance. Some of the\r\ncommoner forms are shown on Plate 29, crystals like C being found\r\nembedded in anhydrite and gypsum.\r\n\r\nMagnesium is a common element and is likely to be present wherever lime\r\nis being deposited, so dolomite crystals are common, and much of the\r\nlimestone is dolomitic.\r\n\r\nIt may be found in almost any limestone section of the country. Some of\r\nthe finest crystals of dolomite however come from Roxbury, Vt.,\r\nSmithfield, R. I., Hoboken, N. J., Lockport, Rochester, and Niagara\r\nFalls, N. Y., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Silicon, Silica and the Silicates\r\n\r\nSilicon is one of the non-metallic elements, and does not occur as such\r\nin Nature. When isolated it is either a dark-brown powder, or steel-gray\r\ncrystals. However silicon is next to oxygen in its importance in making\r\nthe crust of the earth. Forty-seven per cent of the surface rocks are\r\ncomposed of oxygen, and 28% of silicon, the latter appearing in a host\r\nof minerals. The oxide of silicon is termed silica (SiO₂), its crystal\r\nform being quartz, the commonest of all minerals. In non-crystalline\r\nform silica is also widely distributed, as chalcedony and opal, even\r\nappearing in the tissues of animals and plants, as in the feathers of\r\nbirds, the shells of certain Protozoa (Radiolaria), the spicules of\r\nsponges; and in plants, as the shells of diatoms, and in the stalks of\r\ngrasses, especially cereals and bamboo. Silica in the form of sand is\r\nwidely used in making glass, porcelain, china, etc., and in the various\r\ncements.\r\n\r\nThen there are a considerable number of acids of silicon, which do not\r\noccur in Nature, but their salts do, and make a host of minerals, which\r\nare known as the silicates, such as mica, feldspar, hornblende, etc.\r\nEither as quartz, or as silicates, silicon is represented in most all\r\nthe igneous and metamorphic rocks and in many of the sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuartz\r\nSiO₂\r\nPl. 30\r\n\r\nOccurs as hexagonal crystals, or in grains or masses; hardness 7;\r\nspecific gravity 2.65; colorless when pure; luster vitreous; transparent\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nQuartz is not hard to identify. Its hardness and the crystal-form\r\nseparate it from most all other minerals. It is the most common mineral,\r\nmaking 12% of the earth’s crust. The usual crystal form is a hexagonal\r\nprism with the sides horizontally striated, and a six-sided pyramid on\r\none or both ends. This six-sided pyramid is really two rhombohedrons, a\r\nright-handed one and a left-handed one, so that the alternate faces of\r\nthe pyramid may show peculiarities, for instance three may be large and\r\nthree small, as in Fig. B, Plate 30, or the alternate ones may be duller\r\nor etched in some manner. The crystals are clear and when pure\r\ncolorless, but there is a tendency for some slight impurity to color\r\nthem almost any hue.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect double-ended crystals form only where growth is\r\npossible in all directions, as in clay. In cavities and caves there is\r\nan opportunity for the crystals to grow in toward the open spaces, and\r\nin such places, one finds fine large crystals; the Alps, Brazil, Japan,\r\nand Madagascar being especially famous localities. The largest quartz\r\ncrystal on record is one 25 feet in circumference which came from\r\nMadagascar. In this country the caves at Little Rock, Ark., have\r\nfurnished some very fine large crystals. Smaller, but very clear\r\ncrystals, come from about Herkimer, N. Y. Some of these have been used\r\nas “Rhine-stones” and as cheap imitations of diamonds. Clear quartz is\r\nbeautiful enough to be a gem, but it is too common to interest people as\r\njewelry, however many objects of art have been carved from it. One of\r\nthese took the form of crystal balls, which, through the Middle Ages\r\nparticularly, developed into a form of mysticism. The gazing into the\r\ncrystal ball was supposed to give some people supernatural vision. It\r\nseems to be a form of hypnotism, gazing at the bright reflecting surface\r\ntiring the eye, and making possible visions, which are subjective rather\r\nthan anything external.\r\n\r\nSilica is slightly soluble in water, especially when it is alkaline; so\r\nthat most river-, lake-, and sea-waters have some silica in solution,\r\nand are carrying it from one place to another. The waters, which\r\npercolate through the rocks, carry even more, and when they come out\r\ninto open spaces, they give up some of the silica, making crystals\r\nlining these openings, whether fissures or cavities. Not infrequently\r\nthese silica-bearing waters dissolve out some other crystal, and then\r\ndeposit in its place silica, thus making a crystal which has the form of\r\nwhat was dissolved, rather than that of quartz. Such a form is known as\r\na pseudomorph.\r\n\r\nWhen molten masses of igneous rock were cooling the quartz crystals had\r\ntheir faces interfered with as they grew, and we have resulting\r\ncrystalline quartz, simply filling in the spaces between the other\r\ncrystals, such as feldspar and mica, in the granite. Quartz is a large\r\ncomponent in many igneous rocks, also in metamorphic rocks, and certain\r\nsedimentary rocks like sandstone are almost wholly made up of quartz\r\ngrains. Quartz is also the gangue mineral in many veins. In this case it\r\nseems to have been deposited from hot water or vapors, as they rose from\r\ncooling magmas. With it are associated all sorts of metallic ores as has\r\nbeen suggested.\r\n\r\nQuartz has been largely used to make imitations of other much rarer\r\nminerals, sometimes in its crystalline form to imitate the diamond, at\r\nother times ground and made into a “paste,” which is colored to imitate\r\nother gems. This paste is a mixture of about 4 parts of quartz, 5 parts\r\nof red lead and 1 part of potassium carbonate, melted and cooled slowly.\r\nIt is clear and has a brilliant luster like the diamond. If some\r\ncoloring matter is put into it it can be used for rubies, sapphires,\r\netc. When there is any reason to think that this is being used, it is\r\neasily detected by being so much softer than any of the true gems, and\r\neven than true quartz. Quartz will scratch glass readily, but this\r\nimitation has only the hardness of very soft glass, or about 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Varieties of Quartz\r\n\r\nRock crystal is the term applied to quartz when it is clear and\r\ncolorless.\r\n\r\nMilky quartz is the milky variety, the whiteness being due to\r\nimperfections in the crystallization, such as cracks, bubbles, etc.\r\n\r\nSmoky quartz is the cloudy brown-colored variety, which results from the\r\npresence of small quantities of organic matter (hydrocarbons) in the\r\nquartz. If the color is so dark as to be almost black it is termed\r\nmorion. In the above cases the color will disappear if the stone is\r\nheated. Pebbles of smoky quartz from Cairngorm, Scotland, have been so\r\nwidely used as semiprecious stones that they have come to be known as\r\ncairngorms.\r\n\r\nCitrine, or false topaz, is a clear yellow variety, the color again due\r\nto the presence of organic matter. It is distinguished from true topaz\r\nby the lesser hardness, this having the hardness of 7, while true topaz\r\nhas a hardness of 8.\r\n\r\nAmethyst is quartz with a violet color, due to the presence of small\r\nquantities of manganese. To be suitable for cutting into gems, the color\r\nmust be deep or the small pieces will appear almost colorless. It is\r\nwidely used today as a semiprecious stone in jewelry; and in the\r\nfifteenth century it had the traditional virtue of making the wearer\r\nsober-minded, whether he had taken too freely of wine, or was over\r\nexcited by love-passion.\r\n\r\nRose quartz gets its pale-red color from the presence of a small amount\r\nof titanium. It is widely distributed, but is more abundant in the Black\r\nHills of South Dakota.\r\n\r\nAventurine is quartz which has inclosed tiny scales of mica or hematite\r\ngiving it a spangled appearance.\r\n\r\nPrase is a green quartz, the color being due to the inclusion of fibrous\r\ncrystals of green actinolite.\r\n\r\nCat’s Eye is a quartz which has inclosed silky fibers of asbestos. When\r\nthis is cut parallel to the fibers, the effect is opalescent. The colors\r\nare greenish, yellowish-gray, and brown. This form, however, is not to\r\nbe confused with the true or Oriental Cat’s Eye, which is chrysoberyl\r\nand has the hardness of 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalcedony\r\nSiO₂\r\n\r\nNon-crystalline, occurring in botryoidal, stalactitic or concretionary\r\nmasses; hardness, 7; specific gravity, 2.65; color white when pure;\r\nluster waxy; translucent to transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the crystalline form, silica is freely deposited in an\r\namorphous or cryptocrystalline form which has the same properties as\r\nquartz, except the crystal faces. This is called chalcedony, and it\r\noccurs in seams, cavities and free surfaces. When the surface of a\r\nchalcedony deposit is free it has a waxy luster. It is generally very\r\nbrittle and breaks in a peculiar splintery manner. Like quartz it also\r\nhas a great many varieties, according to the impurities present. Its\r\nwide distribution, hardness, and the manner in which it can be chipped\r\nhave made this a most important stone in the history of the development\r\nof civilization. The early men first broke it into rough tools, such as\r\nknives, axes, spear points, etc., and used these as cutting tools, of\r\none sort or another, because they held their edge better than most\r\nstones. We apply, to the people who used only these chipped stones as\r\ntools, the term “_Men of the Old Stone Age_,” or the period is termed\r\nthe _Palæolithic Age_. Later men learned how to grind the edge to a\r\nsmoother outline, and this much shorter period is termed the _Neolithic\r\nAge_. The use of flints for the first tools is world-wide, and the\r\nAmerican Indian when discovered was still using chalcedony in its\r\nrough-hewn state.\r\n\r\n      “There the ancient Arrow-maker\r\n  Made his arrow heads of sandstone,\r\n  Arrow heads of chalcedony,\r\n  Arrow heads of flint and jasper,\r\n  Smoothed and sharpened at the edges,\r\n  Hard and polished, keen and costly.”\r\n\r\nChalcedony is the proper term to use when the color is white to\r\ntranslucent, in which case the surfaces are usually botryoidal and waxy.\r\n\r\nCarnelian is chalcedony which is clear red in color and translucent.\r\nThis is one of the first stones used for ornamental purposes and for\r\nengraving. Carnelians with figures engraved on them were used by the\r\nEgyptians, Assyrians and The Children of Israel, at least 2000 B.C.; and\r\nthe Egyptian scarabs of the fifth or sixth century B.C., were often\r\ncarved from this variety of chalcedony, as well as from jasper and\r\nagates.\r\n\r\nThe brownish varieties are termed _sard_.\r\n\r\nChrysoprase is an apple-green variety of chalcedony the color being due\r\nto the presence of nickel oxide. This is by no means as common as most\r\nof the varieties of chalcedony, and was long prized as a gem.\r\n\r\nPlasma is chalcedony with a leek- to emerald-green color, and the same\r\nstone when it has small red spots of jasper in it is termed\r\n_blood-stone_, or _heliotrope_. These red spots are said by tradition to\r\nbe drops of the blood of Christ.\r\n\r\nJasper is a deep red chalcedony, the color being due to hematite, which\r\nis so abundant as to make it opaque. A brown variety colored by limonite\r\nis also called jasper, and even green jaspers are found. In all cases\r\nthe opaque character is common.\r\n\r\nFlint is an impure brown chalcedony, usually forming concretions. The\r\ncolor is due to organic matter. Flint is mostly found in limestone or\r\nchalk, and the concretions are the result of the small particles of\r\nsilica scattered through the rock being dissolved, and then\r\nreprecipitated about some organic center. Generally the silica was\r\nobtained by the dissolution of small fossils, like the shells of diatoms\r\nor sponge spicules.\r\n\r\nHornstone and Chert are simply impure varieties of flint, brown in\r\ncolor, and with a splintery fracture.\r\n\r\nAgate, Plate 32, is a banded or cloudy chalcedony which has formed in a\r\ncavity, the layers of different color representing deposition from\r\nwater, carrying first silica with one impurity, then later, silica with\r\nanother impurity. Gradually the cavity has been thus filled with silica;\r\nand when the mass is freed by the weathering away of the surrounding\r\nrock, these banded masses are found. Sometimes the manner of deposition\r\nhas changed, and while the outer part of the cavity was filled with\r\nchalcedony, the central part will contain quartz crystals. On account of\r\nthe beauty of the colors, and the unusual way in which they may be\r\ndeveloped, agates are widely used for semiprecious jewelry and objects\r\nof art, and this has been true since ancient times, the name itself\r\ncoming from the River Achates in Sicily. The center for cutting and\r\npolishing agates is at Oberstein, Germany, where this work has been\r\ncarried on since the middle of the fifteenth century. In spite of the\r\nmany fine natural colors in agates, they are sometimes artificially\r\ncolored, in many cases by methods which are kept as “trade secrets.” The\r\ncolor seldom penetrates far; so that even slight chipping reveals\r\nwhether an inferior agate has been taken and colored up, or whether the\r\nstone is natural. Moss agates are chalcedony which has inclosed\r\ndendritic masses of some one of the manganese compounds as shown under\r\nmanganite, p. 73.\r\n\r\nOnyx is a variety of agate where the bands are alternately black and\r\nwhite; while sardonyx is agate with red or brown bands alternating with\r\nthe white. Such agates as these are especially desirable for cameo work,\r\nwhere the figure is carved in the chalcedony of one color, and the other\r\ncolor makes the background.\r\n\r\nSilicified or _agatized wood_ is a form of chalcedony, where silica has\r\nreplaced wood, molecule by molecule; so that in good specimens, all the\r\nstructure of the wood is still retained, and when thin sections are made\r\nit can be studied under the microscope almost as well as modern wood.\r\nThis takes place under water, usually, if not always, in fresh water.\r\nSuch fossilized wood is widely distributed in the western United States,\r\nthe most famous cases being the Fossil Forest of Arizona, now a National\r\nReservation, and the fossil trees in the Yellowstone National Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpal\r\nSiO₂·H₂O\r\nPl. 33\r\n\r\nNon-crystalline, massive, stalactitic or nodular; hardness, 6; specific\r\ngravity 2; all colors; luster vitreous, resinous, or pearly; transparent\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nOpal differs from chalcedony in having water, usually about 10%,\r\nincorporated in its structure. This is water of crystallization, and not\r\nfirmly held; so that, if opal is heated in a closed tube to above 100\r\nC., it is given off as a vapor. Opal is distinguished from chalcedony by\r\nits lesser hardness, and the resinous to pearly luster. It forms in\r\ncavities, in layers often of extreme thinness.\r\n\r\nOpal is originally the product of the dissolution of silicate minerals\r\nin hot acid waters, the resulting gelatinous silica, when it is\r\ndeposited and hardened, becoming the opal. There are many varieties,\r\nsome of them highly prized as gems in spite of the moderate hardness and\r\nopacity of the mineral. Gem-quality opal gets its opalescent character\r\nfrom the successive deposition of thin films of opal, the light\r\npenetrating and being reflected from different films. This breaks up the\r\nwhite light and causes the play of colors which is the charm of this\r\ngem.\r\n\r\nPrecious opal, in which the play of colors is finest, comes mostly from\r\nHungary, Mexico, and Queensland. The opal was a favorite stone from\r\nbefore Roman times, and in its early history was a charm against the\r\n“evil eye.” During the nineteenth century for some reason it came to be\r\nconsidered an unlucky stone.\r\n\r\nFire opal is a hyacinth-red to honey-yellow variety, which has a\r\nfire-like play of color, and is found in Mexico and Honduras.\r\n\r\nCommon opal does not have the play of color, but comes in a variety of\r\ncolors; is waxy or greasy in luster; and occurs mostly as fillings of\r\nseams or cavities, especially those in igneous rocks, like the steam\r\nholes in lavas, etc. It is found in Cornwall, Penn., in Colorado,\r\nCalifornia, etc.\r\n\r\nOpal-agate is a variety in which there are color bands, and it is widely\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nOpalized wood is formed in exactly the same manner as agatized wood,\r\nmuch of the fossil wood called silicified being really opalized.\r\n\r\nSiliceous sinter is the porous mass of opal which is so frequently\r\ndeposited about hot springs and geysers. It is readily recognized by its\r\nporous character.\r\n\r\nThe shells of the diatoms, which are microscopic plants, are made of\r\nopal; and while they are so small, there is certainly no other plant so\r\nabundant or omnipresent, living as it does in every pool, lake, or sea\r\nby the millions. These shells are very indestructible so that they\r\naccumulate at the bottom of ponds, bogs, and sea-bottoms, making at\r\ntimes extensive deposits. This material in quantities is termed\r\ndiatomaceous earth, or tripolite (from Tripoli where it was first used\r\ncommercially). It is used as a polishing powder for metals, marble,\r\nglasses, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Feldspars\r\n\r\nThe term feldspar is a family name for a large variety of very common\r\nminerals, which altogether make up nearly 60% of the crust of the earth,\r\nbeing the predominant part of granites, gneisses, and lavas. In\r\ncomposition they are silicates of aluminum, together with potassium,\r\nsodium and calcium, and their mixtures. They may be tabulated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1. KAlSi₃O₈, _orthoclase_, the silicate of aluminum and potassium.\r\n  2. NaAlSi₃O₈, _albite_, the silicate of aluminum and sodium.\r\n  3. CaAlSi₂O₈, _anorthite_, the silicate of aluminum and calcium.\r\n  4. Mixtures of 1 and 2 are _alkalic feldspar_.\r\n  5. Mixtures of 2 and 3 are _plagioclase feldspar_.\r\n\r\nOrthoclase is monoclinic, but the rest of the feldspars are triclinic.\r\nIf crystals are available they may be short and stout, or tabular and\r\nthin, but as the feldspars are mostly components of the igneous rocks,\r\nwhere perfect crystals have not had a chance to grow, they are mostly\r\ndetermined by their hardness and cleavage. The hardness of all the\r\nfeldspars is 6 or very close to it.\r\n\r\nThey all have three planes of cleavage, two of which are good and\r\nintersect either at 90° as in orthoclase, or at about 86° as in the\r\nplagioclase series; while the third cleavage plane is imperfect. In\r\nfigure 1, Plate 34, a and b are the two perfect cleavages, while c is\r\nthe imperfect one. Breaking into such cleavage masses as the one\r\nillustrated is characteristic of feldspar. The specific gravity ranges\r\nfrom 2.55 to 2.75. The luster is vitreous, and the color white, ranging\r\nto various shades of gray and pink, and, sometimes in recent lavas,\r\ncolorless.\r\n\r\nTwinning is very common and helps to distinguish orthoclase from the\r\nplagioclase feldspars. In orthoclase the twins are simple, that is, only\r\ntwo crystals growing together, and are united on one of the faces, as if\r\none of them had been revolved 180° with the other; or, while related to\r\neach other as in the preceding case, they may seem to grow through each\r\nother. On plate 34 are three orthoclase crystals showing this simple\r\ntype of twinning. The first (A) is a simple crystal; the second (B)\r\nshows the simplest type of twinning where the left-hand crystal has\r\nrevolved 180° on the p face, and the end is composed, half of the upper\r\nend of one crystal, and half of the lower end of the adjacent crystal.\r\nThe presence of reëntrant angles calls attention to the twinning. The\r\nthird figure (C) is a case of intergrowing crystals.\r\n\r\nIn the plagioclase feldspars twinning is multiple, a large number of\r\ncrystals, each thin, sometimes as thin as paper, growing side by side,\r\nthe first one in normal position, the next at 180° with it, the third\r\nrevolved 180° to the second and thus parallel to the first, and so on.\r\nThe result is first of all a striated appearance, and second that, as\r\nplagioclase crystals have their prism faces intersecting at 86°, there\r\nis a series of low roofs and valleys, which are best seen by holding the\r\npiece of feldspar so the light reflects from a cleavage face, when it\r\nwill appear striated; then by tilting it about 8 degrees a second set of\r\nreflections, also appearing striated, will appear. The light was first\r\nreflected from one side of the roofs, and in the second case from the\r\nother side. Figure D, Pl. 34, is a diagram showing the relation of the\r\nindividual crystals in a multiple twinned piece of plagioclase, in which\r\nthe crystals are represented as rather large. Plate 35, under\r\nlabradorite, shows a photograph of a cleavage piece, on which is readily\r\nseen the striation which is characteristic of the plagioclase feldspars.\r\n\r\nMixtures of albite and anorthite occur in bewildering numbers, one or\r\nthe other predominating, and each mixture being uniform throughout the\r\ncrystal and in the whole mass; so each combination is a mineral, each\r\nwith its special properties; but the different plagioclase feldspars are\r\nso similar in appearance, that by the naked eye it is impossible to\r\nseparate the closely related ones. This can be done under the microscope\r\nby studying the angles at which light is cut off, and also by chemical\r\nanalyses. For our purposes six types will suffice to illustrate the\r\ngroup, and their composition may be indicated as follows.\r\n\r\nAlbite is albite with up to 15% of anorthite mixed with it.\r\n\r\nOligoclase is albite with from 15-25% of anorthite mixed with it.\r\n\r\nAndesite is albite with from 25-50% of anorthite mixed with it.\r\n\r\nLabradorite is anorthite with from 25-50% of albite mixed with it.\r\n\r\nBytownite is anorthite with from 15-25% of albite mixed with it.\r\n\r\nAnorthite is anorthite with up to 15% of albite mixed with it.\r\n\r\nThe best method for distinguishing these feldspars of the plagioclase\r\ngroup is to measure the angle between the two perfect cleavage faces,\r\nand even this requires careful measurement. The angles between these\r\nfaces are as follows:\r\n\r\n               Orthoclase            90°\r\n               Microcline            89° 30′\r\n               Oligoclase            86° 32′\r\n               Andesite              86° 14′\r\n               Labradorite           86° 14′\r\n               Bytownite             86° 14′\r\n               Anorthite             86° 50′\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthoclase\r\nKAlSi₃O₈\r\n\r\nOccurs in granites, syenites, gneisses and light-colored lavas;\r\nhardness, 6; specific gravity, 2.57; color white to gray or pink;\r\ncleavage in two directions perfect and at 90°, in the third direction\r\nimperfect; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nOrthoclase is monoclinic, and when formed in cavities develops as\r\ncrystals, but it is usually a constituent of igneous rocks, in which\r\ncase the crystals have not had the opportunity to develop the crystal\r\nfaces, and the orthoclase is in grains or irregular masses; and the best\r\nway of determining the mineral is the cleavage, the two perfect cleavage\r\nplanes intersecting at right angles. Twinning is frequent but of the\r\nsimple type, only two crystals being united, similar to either B or C on\r\nplate 34.\r\n\r\nIt is found in granites, gneisses or lavas, wherever they occur, being\r\nespecially characteristic of the granites of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrocline\r\nKAlSi₃O₈\r\nPl. 35\r\n\r\nOccurs in granites and gneisses as crystals or irregular masses;\r\nhardness, 6; specific gravity, 2.56; color white to gray, pink, or\r\ngreenish; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nMicrocline has the same composition as orthoclase, but is in the\r\ntriclinic system, the c axis being inclined a half degree away from a\r\nright angle with the b axis. This is best seen in the cleavage pieces,\r\nthe two perfect cleavage planes meeting at 89° 30′, and this is the only\r\ntest for determining this mineral by the unaided eye. Pike’s Peak is the\r\nbest known locality for microcline, and there it occurs in fine large\r\ncrystals of greenish color, which are known as _Amazon stone_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbite\r\nNaAlSi₃O₈\r\n\r\nOccurs in small crystals, or more often in lamellar masses in granites\r\nor in seams in metamorphic rocks; hardness, 6; specific gravity, 2.62;\r\ncolor white to gray; luster vitreous.\r\n\r\nAlbite may occur in simple crystals, in which case the two perfect\r\ncleavage planes meet at an angle of 86° 24′. However, it is much more\r\nfrequently found twinned in the multiple manner, the individual crystals\r\noften being as thin as paper. This gives rise to a fine striation on the\r\nend of a crystal, or on the surface made by the imperfect cleavage\r\nplane. Where the crystals are extremely thin, the surface may have a\r\npearly luster. Albite types of granite often inclose secondary minerals,\r\nthat are prized as gems, such as topaz, tourmaline, and beryl.\r\n\r\nIt is found at Paris, Me., Chesterfield, Mass., Acworth, N. H., Essex\r\nCo., N. Y., Unionville, Penn., and in Virginia, and throughout the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nOligoclase\r\n(NaCa)AlSi₃O₈\r\n\r\nGenerally found in cleavable masses in granites and lavas, rarely in\r\ncrystals; hardness, 6; specific gravity, 2.65; color white, greenish or\r\npink; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nOligoclase is a plagioclase feldspar and is distinguished by its two\r\nperfect cleavage planes meeting at an angle of 86° 32′, but otherwise it\r\nis very like albite. Crystals are not common, and it occurs mostly in\r\nmasses, making one of the components of granite or lava.\r\n\r\nIt is found in St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., Danbury and Haddam, Conn.,\r\nChester, Mass., Unionville, Penn., Bakersville, N. C., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabradorite\r\n(NaCa)AlSi₃O₈\r\nPl. 35\r\n\r\nUsually found in cleavable masses in granites and lavas; hardness, 6;\r\nspecific gravity, 2.71; color gray or white, often with a play of\r\ncolors; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nLabradorite is distinguished by having the two perfect cleavage planes\r\nmeet at 86° 14′. The iridescent play of color is also very\r\ncharacteristic and is generally present. It is due to the inclusion of\r\nminute impurities. This feldspar is usually associated with granites or\r\nlavas in which the dark minerals predominate. It gets its name from\r\nbeing the feldspar of the granites of Labrador, and is also found in the\r\ngranites of the central part of the Adirondack Mountains and the Wichita\r\nMountains of Arkansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Pyroxene Group\r\n\r\nThe minerals of this group are generally associated with feldspars, and\r\nmake the dark-colored component of granites, gneisses and lavas. This is\r\nespecially true of those which have some iron in the crystal. Pyroxenes\r\nare salts of metasilicic acid (H₂SiO₃), in which the hydrogen (H) has\r\nbeen replaced by calcium, magnesium, iron, etc. The commoner minerals\r\nare orthorhombic or monoclinic, and all agree in their crystal habit,\r\nbeing short stout prisms, with the vertical edges so beveled that a\r\ncross section is eight-sided. The cleavage is good in two directions,\r\nparallel to the beveling faces (m in figure b, Plate 36), and they\r\nintersect at an angle of 87°. This is very characteristic, and if one\r\nhas a crystal broken across, it is easy to see and measure this angle of\r\nintersection. These pyroxenes have the same chemical composition as the\r\ncorresponding series of amphiboles, but the two are distinguished by\r\nseveral features. Pyroxenes are short and stout crystals, while\r\namphiboles are long and either blade- or needle-like; pyroxenes are\r\neight-sided in cross section, while amphiboles are six-sided; in\r\npyroxenes the cleavage planes intersect at 87°, while in amphiboles they\r\nintersect at 55°. The minerals of this group are most frequently one of\r\nthe components of a lava or granite, and are less frequently associated\r\nwith metamorphic rocks. Three are common; enstatite, hypersthene, and\r\naugite.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnstatite\r\nMgSiO₃\r\n\r\nUsually occurs in lamellar or fibrous-lamellar masses in dark lavas;\r\nhardness, 5.5; specific gravity, 3.3; color gray, bronze or brown;\r\nluster vitreous, translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nEnstatite rarely occurs in crystals, but when it does they are\r\northorhombic. Usually it is in irregular masses with the cleavage\r\nangles, typical of pyroxene. The color is light, that is gray or\r\nbrownish, and the streak white or nearly so. In most respects it is\r\nsimilar to hypersthene, which has the same composition, except that a\r\nlarge part of the magnesium is replaced by iron, and there are all sorts\r\nof gradations between the two minerals. When some iron takes the place\r\nof magnesium, the color darkens to, or towards bronze, until when about\r\na third of the magnesium is so replaced, and the color is fully bronze,\r\nthis variety is called _bronzite_. Bronzite is present in some of the\r\ndark lavas like gabbro and peridotite. Enstatite is found in the\r\nAdirondack Mountains, at Brewster and Edwards, N. Y., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypersthene\r\n(MgFe)SiO₃\r\n\r\nOccurs in cleavable masses in dark lavas; hardness, 5.5; specific\r\ngravity, 3.4; color dark-brown or greenish-brown; luster vitreous;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nHypersthene is a pyroxene in which magnesium and iron are present in\r\nabout equal quantities. It is similar to enstatite, except that the\r\ncolor is darker, and the streak gray or brownish-gray in color. These\r\ntwo minerals grade into each other, so that there are cases where it is\r\nsimply a matter of preference as to which name should be given to the\r\nmineral. This form is associated with dark lavas, of the gabbro or\r\nperidotite type, in such places as the Adirondack Mountains, Mount\r\nShasta in California, Buffalo Peaks, Colo., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugite\r\nCaMg(SiO₃)₂, MgAlSiO₆ + Fe₂O₃\r\nPl. 36\r\n\r\nUsually occurs in short stout monoclinic crystals; hardness, 5.5;\r\nspecific gravity, 3.3; color dark-green to black; luster vitreous;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nAugite is a complex pyroxene having some iron and aluminum always\r\npresent in it, but the amount not a fixed quantity. It is by far the\r\ncommonest of the pyroxenes and has a wide distribution, both in the\r\nsorts of lavas in which it appears, and in the world. It is commonly the\r\ndark component of such lavas, as gabbros and peridotites, and also is\r\ncommon in metamorphic rocks, especially impure crystalline limestones.\r\nIt is found at Raymond and Mumford, Me., Thetford, Vt., Canaan, Conn.,\r\nin Westchester, Orange, Lewis and St. Lawrence Counties of N. Y., in\r\nChester Co., Penn., at Ducktown, Tenn., Templeton, Canada, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Amphibole Group\r\n\r\nThe amphiboles are a group of minerals made up of the same chemical\r\nelements as the pyroxenes, but with the molecular arrangement different,\r\nwhich appears in the forms of the crystals. The commoner ones are all\r\nmonoclinic but contrast with the pyroxenes as follows. Amphiboles are\r\nlong and slender crystals, while pyroxenes are short and stout;\r\namphiboles are six-sided, while pyroxenes are eight-sided; amphiboles\r\nhave the two perfect cleavages intersecting at 55° and 125°, while those\r\nof pyroxene intersect at 87° and 93°. With the above in mind it is easy\r\nto place the minerals in their proper group, but inside the group it is\r\nnot always so easy to distinguish one from another. This group is\r\nassociated rather with metamorphic rocks than with igneous rocks, with\r\nwhich the pyroxenes are mostly associated. The three commoner minerals\r\nof the group are tremolite, actinolite, and hornblende.\r\n\r\n\r\nTremolite\r\n(CaMg)₃(SiO₃)₄\r\nPl. 37\r\n\r\nOccurs in long prismatic crystals or in columnar or fibrous masses;\r\nhardness 5.5; specific gravity, 3; color white to gray; luster vitreous;\r\ntransparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThe long prismatic crystals of tremolite occur especially where\r\ndolomitic limestones have been altered by metamorphism. Sometimes these\r\ncrystals grow side by side, making fibrous masses, where the long\r\nslender crystals can be picked apart with the fingers, and yet are\r\nflexible, and tough enough so that they can be felted together. This is\r\ntermed asbestos, which, because it is infusible and a poor conductor of\r\nheat, is much used to make insulators, fire-proof shingles, and all\r\nsorts of fireproof materials. The varieties in which the crystals are\r\nfiner and silky in appearance, like the one illustrated on Plate 38 are\r\ntermed _amianthus_. There are other minerals, such as actinolite and\r\nserpentine, which occur in the same manner, and are also called\r\nasbestos, the serpentine variety being just now the most important\r\ncommercially.\r\n\r\nTremolite is found at Lee, Mass., Canaan, Conn., Byram, N. J., in\r\nGeorgia, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nActinolite\r\n(CaMgFe)₃(SiO₃)₄\r\n\r\nOccurs in radiating crystals, or in fibrous masses; hardness, 5.5;\r\nspecific gravity 3; color pale- to dark-green; luster vitreous;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nExcept for its green color, this mineral is very like tremolite. The\r\ndifference between the two is due to the small amount of iron in the\r\nactinolite. It is usually found in schists, and the radiating character\r\nof the crystal groups is enough to determine the mineral, if it is\r\nalready clear that it is one of the amphiboles. Occasionally it occurs\r\nwith the crystals parallel to each other, making one of the forms of\r\nasbestos.\r\n\r\nActinolite is found at Warwick, Edenville, and Amity in Orange Co., N.\r\nY., at Franklin and Newton, N. J., Mineral Hill and Unionville, Penn.,\r\nBare Hills, Md., Willis Mt., Va., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHornblende\r\n(CaMgFe)₃(SiO₃)₄CaMgAl₂(SiO₄)₃\r\nPl. 37\r\n\r\nOccurs in well-defined crystals, in grains and in masses; hardness, 5.5;\r\nspecific gravity 3.2; color black, dark-green, or dark-brown; luster\r\nvitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nIn composition hornblende corresponds to augite, but occurs in long\r\nslender, six-sided crystals with cleavage planes intersecting at 55°, so\r\nthat it is a typical amphibole. It occurs in a very wide range of rocks,\r\nsuch as granite, syenite, diabase, and gabbro; and in such metamorphic\r\nrocks as schists and gneisses; and sometimes igneous rocks are made up\r\nalmost entirely of hornblende, when they are known as amphibolites or\r\nhornblendite. It is found all through the New England States, down along\r\nthe Piedmont Plateau, through the Blue Ridge Mountains, and in many of\r\nthe western mountainous areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               The Garnet Group\r\n\r\nThe garnets are a series of double silicates, which occur with\r\nsurprisingly uniform characters. They are all isometric, and occur\r\neither as dodecahedrons, or as the 24-sided figure (the trapezohedron),\r\nwhich is formed by the beveling of the edges of the dodecahedron, and\r\ndeveloping these new faces to the exclusion of the dodecahedron faces.\r\nCombinations of the dodecahedron and trapezohedron (36 faces) may occur.\r\nAll the garnets have a hardness of 7 to 7.5, and the specific gravity\r\nruns from 3.2 to 4.3, according to the composition. In size they run\r\nfrom as small as a grain of sand up to as large as a boy’s marble, and\r\noccasionally even to four inches in diameter. The color varies with the\r\ncomposition, from colorless to yellow, red, violet, or green. There is\r\nno cleavage, and the luster is always vitreous.\r\n\r\nGarnets are usually accessory minerals, found in metamorphic rocks,\r\nthough they are sometimes also present in granites and lavas. They are\r\nalways segregations which have taken place in the presence of high\r\ntemperatures. When clear and perfect several of the garnets are used as\r\ngems. On the other hand some of the common garnets occur in such\r\nquantities that they are crushed and used as abrasives, for such work as\r\ndental polishes, or for leather and wood polishing.\r\n\r\nThe following is the composition of some of the commoner garnets.\r\n\r\n  Ca₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃    = grossularite\r\n  Mg₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃    = pyrope\r\n  Fe₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃    = almandite\r\n  Mn₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃    = spessartite\r\n  Ca₃Fe₂(SiO₄)₃    = andradite\r\n  Ca₃Cr₂(SiO₄)₃    = uvarovite\r\n\r\nGrossularite is chiefly found in crystalline limestones, which have\r\nresulted either from contact with lavas, or from general metamorphism of\r\nimpure limestones. These garnets are colorless to white, or more often\r\nshades of yellow, orange, pink, green or brown, according to traces of\r\nimpurity which they may contain. The cinnamon-colored variety from\r\nCeylon is termed _cinnamon stone_, and is a fairly popular gem.\r\n\r\nPyrope is a deep-red color and when perfect is highly prized as a gem.\r\nIt is found in dark-colored igneous rocks, like lavas, or serpentines.\r\nSome of the finest come from South Africa, where they are found in\r\ncompany with the diamond.\r\n\r\nAlmandite is dark-red to brown in color, the brownish-cast\r\ndistinguishing it from pyrope. It is one of the garnets known as “common\r\ngarnet.” In some cases it is clear and deep colored enough to be used as\r\na gem, but mostly it is muddy in appearance. The name almandite comes\r\nfrom Alabanda, a city of the ancient district of Caria, Asia Minor,\r\nwhence garnets were traded to ancient Rome. The finest garnets “Sirian\r\ngarnets” came from the city of “Sirian” in Lower Burma, and were\r\nsupposed to have been found near there, but careful investigation shows\r\nthat no garnets occurred near there, and this town was therefore, even\r\nat that early time, a distributing point for garnets, found probably\r\nfurther to the east. The “Sirian” garnet had a violet cast and now the\r\nterm is used to indicate a type of garnet, rather than a locality.\r\n\r\nSpessartite is dark-hyacinth-red, or red with a violet-tinge, and is one\r\nof the less-common garnets. It is usually found in granites. The finest\r\ngarnets of the type come from Amelia Court House, Va., which has yielded\r\nsome ranging from one up to a hundred carats.\r\n\r\nAndradite is another garnet which is termed “common garnet.” It is red\r\nin color, but with a yellowish-cast which distinguishes it from\r\nalmandite, but these two are not easy to separate. It is found mostly in\r\nmetamorphosed limestones. One variety is black in color and called\r\n_malanite_. It is found in lavas. The common yellowish-red garnets are\r\nfound through New England and the Piedmont Plateau.\r\n\r\nUvarovite is a rare garnet of emerald-green color, found in association\r\nwith chromium ores.\r\n\r\nThe number of localities for garnets is so great that a list would\r\nsuggest most of the regions where metamorphic rocks occur, as all over\r\nNew England, throughout the Piedmont Plateau, the Rocky Mountains, etc.\r\nCertain fine clear garnets, found in Montana, northeastern Arizona, and\r\nnorthwestern New Mexico are sold under the trade name of “Montana,\r\nArizona or New Mexico rubies.” These are of fine quality and are mostly\r\ncollected by the Indians from the ant hills and scorpion’s nests of\r\nthose regions.\r\n\r\nGarnets are among the earliest stones mentioned in ancient languages, as\r\nwould be expected from the way these hard and beautiful crystals weather\r\nout of the much softer metamorphic rocks, like schists. In the past\r\nthey, with most any other translucent red stone, were included under the\r\nname _carbuncle_. This, however, is not the name of any mineral, but\r\nrefers rather to a mode of cutting, _en cabochon_ or with a convex\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Glucinum\r\n\r\nGlucinum is a rare metal, silvery-white in color, malleable, and melting\r\nat a fairly low temperature. It is found in the mineral beryl, from\r\nwhich has come the alternative name _beryllium_. The name comes from the\r\nsweet taste of its salts. Except for beryl its minerals are rare, and\r\nthe metal has found but few uses for man.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeryl\r\nGl₃Al₂(SiO₃)₆\r\nPl. 39\r\n\r\nOccurs in hexagonal crystals in granites, gneisses and mica schists;\r\nhardness, 7.5; specific gravity, 2.7; color usually some tint of green;\r\nluster vitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhen this mineral occurs in coarse hexagonal prisms, with or without\r\nfaces on the ends, it is known as beryl; when the crystals are clear and\r\nperfect and of a dark-green color, they are of gem value and are termed\r\n_emerald_; when of a light-green color, they are _aquamarine_; and when\r\nbright-yellow in color, they are the _golden beryl_. There is little\r\ndifficulty in determining beryl, for only apatite occurs in such\r\ncrystals, and is green, and this latter mineral has a hardness of only\r\n5. There is an imperfect basal cleavage.\r\n\r\nOrdinary beryl is fairly common in granites of the pegmatite sort, and\r\nless common in gneisses and mica-schists. This type often furnishes\r\ncrystals of large size, up to two and three feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nBeryl which is free from cracks and inclosures, so it can be used as a\r\ngem, is so rare, that the emerald has a value above that of the diamond,\r\nand second only to the ruby. It is one of the gems with a long history,\r\nhaving been quarried on the west coast of the Red Sea at least 1650 B.C.\r\nby the Egyptians. To early people it had a power to quicken the prophet\r\ninstinct and made the wearer see more clearly. The Spanish\r\nconquistadores found fine emeralds among the treasures of both Mexico\r\nand Peru. In the United States, Stony Point, N. C., was a notable\r\nlocality for these gems, but now seems to have been exhausted. The name\r\nemerald has been applied to many other green stones, usually with some\r\ngeographical modification, as “Oriental emerald” which is green\r\ncorundum, “Brazilian emerald” which is tourmaline, etc.\r\n\r\nGiant beryls have been found at Acworth and Grafton, N. H., and at\r\nRoyalston, Mass. Localities for ordinary beryl are Albany, Norway,\r\nBethel, Hebron, Paris, and Topsham, Me., Barre, Goshen and Chesterfield,\r\nMass., New Milford and Branchville, Conn., Chester and Mineral Hill,\r\nPenn., Stony Point, N. C., and many other localities in the\r\nAppalachians; also Mount Antero, Colo., and in the Black Hills of South\r\nDakota.\r\n\r\n\r\nSodalite\r\nNa₄Al₃Cl(SiO₄)₃\r\n\r\nOccurs in irregular masses, sometimes in dodecahedrons; hardness, 5.5-6;\r\nspecific gravity, 2.3; color deep-blue to colorless; streak white;\r\nluster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis striking mineral, with its deep-blue to azure color, is not easily\r\nconfused with any other. It is characteristic of soda-rich igneous rocks\r\nsuch as syenite and some lavas. In this country it is found at\r\nLitchfield, Me., and Salem, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nZircon\r\nZrSiO₄\r\nPl. 39\r\n\r\nUsually occurs in tetrahedral crystals in igneous rocks; hardness, 7.5;\r\nspecific gravity, 4.7; color brown; luster vitreous; translucent on thin\r\nedges.\r\n\r\nZircon, the mineral of the rare earth element zirconium, nearly always\r\noccurs in light-colored igneous rocks, like syenite. It may occur in\r\nschists or gneisses, but in these rocks the crystals are of microscopic\r\nsize. Because of their great hardness and insolubility, zircon crystals\r\nresist weathering and are often found, along with gold, cassiterite, or\r\nmagnetite, in sands which have resulted from the disintegration of\r\nsyenite rocks.\r\n\r\nZircon refracts and disperses light to a degree second only to the\r\ndiamond, so that clear crystals are sought as gems. They are often\r\ncalled “Matura diamonds” because of their abundance at Matura, Ceylon.\r\nWhen the crystals are colorless or smoky they are termed _jargons_ or\r\n_jargoons_; when of a red-orange hue, they are _hyacinth_ or _jacinth_.\r\nMost of the zircon of gem-quality comes from Ceylon, where it is picked\r\nup as rolled-pebbles from the beds of brooks.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable American locality for zircon is near Green River, in\r\nHenderson Co., N. C., where it is found abundantly in a decomposed\r\npegmatite dike, from which many tons have been obtained. It is also\r\nfound at Moriah, Warwick, Amity and Diana, N. Y., at Franklin Furnace,\r\nand Trenton, N. J., in the gold-bearing sands of California, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCyanite\r\nAl₂SiO₅\r\nPl. 40\r\n\r\nOccurs in long blade-like crystals in gneisses and schists; hardness, 7\r\nat right angles to the length, and 4.5 parallel to the length; specific\r\ngravity, 3.6; color blue; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThere are only a few blue minerals, and the way in which cyanite occurs\r\nin long thin blade-like crystals is entirely characteristic. If more is\r\nstill wanted to determine this mineral, its unique character in having\r\nthe great hardness 7 when scratched parallel to the length, and only 4.5\r\nwhen scratched crossways, will settle any doubts.\r\n\r\nThe mineral _sillimanite_ has the same composition as cyanite, but is\r\nfibrous in habit and has the hardness 6.5. If cyanite is heated to 1350°\r\nC. it changes its character and becomes sillimanite.\r\n\r\nCyanite is found as an accessory mineral in metamorphic rocks, such as\r\ngneiss and schist, at Chesterfield, Mass., Litchfield and Oxford, Conn.,\r\nin Chester Co., Penn., in North Carolina, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                The Mica Group\r\n\r\nThe micas are very common minerals, easily recognized by their very\r\nperfect basal cleavage, as a result of which thin sheets, often less\r\nthan a thousandth of an inch in thickness, readily split off. These are\r\ntough and elastic, which distinguishes mica from the chlorite group in\r\nwhich there is similar basal cleavage, but the sheets are not elastic.\r\n\r\nMicas are complex silicates of aluminum, with potassium, iron, lithium,\r\nmagnesium and hydrogen. They are one of the principle components of many\r\ngranites, gneisses, and schists. This mineral is always crystalline,\r\nbeing in the monoclinic system, but occurring in six-sided prisms. The\r\ncleavage is so dominant a character that the crystal form is usually\r\noverlooked, as it is seldom requisite in determining this mineral. The\r\nsize of the sheets of mica depend on the size of the crystals, the\r\nlarger sheets expressing great slowness in cooling from the original\r\nmagmas. Sometimes the crystals may be two or even three feet in\r\ndiameter. The hardness is not great, ranging between 2 and 3. The\r\nspecific gravity lies between 2.7 and 3.2. The color varies according to\r\nthe composition, from silvery-white, through gray, pink, and green to\r\nblack. The luster is vitreous to pearly, sometimes gleaming in the\r\ndarker-colored varieties. The commoner types of mica are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Muscovite, H₂KAl₃(SiO₄)₃ or potash mica.\r\n  Lepidolite, LiK(Al₂OH·F)Al(SiO₃)₃ or lithia mica.\r\n  Biotite, (HK)₂(MgFe)₂Al₂(SiO₄)₃ or iron mica.\r\n  Phlogopite, H₂KMg₃Al(SiO₈)₃ or magnesia mica.\r\n\r\nMuscovite is colorless, silvery-white, gray or sometimes pale-green or\r\nbrown. It gets its name from Moscow where it was early used for window\r\npanes, and it is still used for stove and furnace doors, as well as in\r\nelectric work, for a lubricant, etc.\r\n\r\nThe best crystals occur in granites, in the coarse varieties of which\r\nlarge crystals may be obtained. It is found also as small scales in\r\ngneisses and schists, and when weathered from its original rocks it may\r\nbe present in sandstones and shales. Muscovite is always in its origin\r\nan elementary component of deep-seated igneous rocks, like granite; but\r\nis never a component of extruded lavas. _Sericite_ is muscovite which\r\nhas been secondarily produced by the alteration of other minerals into\r\nmuscovite, as when feldspar, cyanite, topaz, etc., have been modified by\r\nthe presence of heat and hot vapors, when near lavas that have come in\r\ncontact with other rocks. Muscovite is very resistant to alteration by\r\nweathering, but when it does change, the greater part of it becomes\r\nkaolin. It is found at Acworth and Grafton, N. H., in plates, sometimes\r\na yard across at Paris, Me., Chesterfield and Goshen, Mass., Portland\r\nand Middletown, Conn., at Warwick, Edenville, etc., N. Y., and all down\r\nthe Appalachian Mts., also in the Rocky Mts., the Cascade Range, etc.\r\n\r\nLepidolite is pink or lilac in color and occurs in scaly masses, mostly\r\nin granites. It does not come in large crystals. Lepidolite is found at\r\nParis and Hebron, Me., Middletown, Conn., Pala, Calif., etc.\r\n\r\nBiotite is dark-brown or black mica. Like muscovite it is very common,\r\nmaking one of the chief components of granites, gneisses and schists;\r\nand, unlike muscovite, it may occur in extrusive lavas, like trachyte,\r\nandesite, and basalt. It resists weathering much less than muscovite, so\r\nthat, when the rocks of which it is a component disintegrate, biotite is\r\nusually altered to kaolin and other compounds. It is likely to occur in\r\ngood-sized crystals, especially at Topsam, Me., Moriah, N. Y., Easton,\r\nPenn., etc.\r\n\r\nPhlogopite is pale-brown, often coppery in color, and is most likely to\r\noccur in serpentines, or crystalline limestones or dolomites, often in\r\nfine crystals, of good size. While one of the less abundant micas, this\r\nis found at Gouverneur, Edwards, and Warwick, N. Y., Newton, N. J., and\r\nBurgess, Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopaz\r\nAl₂F₂SiO₄\r\nPl. 41\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals mostly; hardness, 8; specific gravity, 3.5; colorless\r\nto pale-yellow; luster vitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nTopaz may be colorless, but is more often some shade of yellow, and at\r\ntimes brown or even blue. Its hardness is characteristic, there being\r\nbut few minerals as hard, and it is used to represent the hardness 8 in\r\nthe Moh’s scale. The crystals are orthorhombic prisms, with the edges of\r\nthe prism beveled and often striated. The ends of crystals usually\r\nterminate with a basal plane, parallel to which there is good cleavage.\r\nBetween this basal plane and the prism faces there are usually several\r\nsets of small faces as indicated on Plate 41.\r\n\r\nThis mineral, as is also true of most minerals containing fluorine, is\r\none of those which have crystallized out from hot vapors, escaping from\r\nigneous magmas. It is associated with such minerals, as tourmaline,\r\nberyl, fluorite, and cassiterite, and occurs mostly in cavities or\r\nseams, in or near granites.\r\n\r\nOrdinary topaz, which means crystals that are imperfect by reason of\r\ntiny cracks and impurities is not very rare, but crystals which are\r\nperfect and clear in color are considered gems. Most of the gem-topaz is\r\nsome shade of yellow, but may be brown or blue, never, however, pink, as\r\nis often seen in jewelry. The “pinking” is artificial, and done by\r\npacking yellow or brown topaz in magnesia, asbestos, or lime, and then\r\nheating it slowly to red heat, after which it is cooled slowly. If\r\nunderheated the color is salmon, if overheated all color disappears.\r\nTopaz has been a gem for centuries, the earliest records coming from\r\nEgypt. The name comes from _topazios_, meaning to seek, because the\r\nearliest known locality, from which it was gathered, was a little island\r\nof that name in the Red Sea, and this island was often surrounded by fog\r\nand hard for those early mariners to find. Here by mandate of the\r\nEgyptian kings the inhabitants had to collect topazes, and deliver them\r\nto the gem-cutters of Egypt for polishing.\r\n\r\nSeveral yellow stones are called topaz, as the “Oriental topaz” which is\r\ncorundum and more valuable than topaz itself; and several varieties of\r\nyellow quartz, which go under such names as “Saxon,” “Scotch,”\r\n“Spanish,” and “smoky” topaz. When topaz occurs colorless as in Siberia,\r\nthe Ural Mountains, and in the state of Minas Geraes, Brazil, in all of\r\nwhich places it is found as pebbles in brooks, it goes under the name of\r\n“slave’s diamonds.” Brazil is today the chief source of gem-quality\r\ntopaz.\r\n\r\nOrdinary topaz is found in this country at Trumbull, Conn., Crowder’s\r\nMt., N. C., Thomas Mts., Utah, in Colorado, Missouri, and California,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nStaurolite\r\nFeAl₅OH(SiO₆)₂\r\nPl. 41\r\n\r\nOccurs in orthorhombic crystals; hardness, 7.5; specific gravity, 3.7;\r\ncolor brown; luster resinous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis mineral occurs about equally abundantly in simple crystals similar\r\nto the outline on Plate 41, and in twins which have grown through each\r\nother either at 90° or at 60°. The color is either brown or\r\nreddish-brown. In all cases it is an accessory mineral, occurring in\r\nmetamorphic rocks, usually schists, though less frequently in slates and\r\ngneisses.\r\n\r\nFrom the seventeenth century on, it has been used as a baptismal stone,\r\nand worn as a charm, legends stating that it fell from the heavens. Fine\r\ncrystals have been found in Patrick County, Va., and there is in this\r\nregion the legend, that when the fairies heard of the crucifixion of\r\nChrist, they wept and their tears falling crystallized in the form of\r\ncrosses, such as the one shown on Plate 41.\r\n\r\nStaurolite is found in the schists of New England as at Windham, Me., or\r\nChesterfield, Mass., and all down the east side of the Appalachian\r\nMountains to Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlivine\r\n(MgFe)₂SiO₄\r\n_Peridot_ or _Chrysolite_\r\n\r\nOccurs in grains and irregular masses in dark lavas; hardness 6.5 to 7;\r\nspecific gravity 3.3; color bottle- to olive-green; luster vitreous;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nOlivine rarely occurs in crystals, but when it does they belong to the\r\northorhombic system. The dark-green grains or masses are recognized by\r\nthe color, considerable hardness and indistinct cleavage. Serpentine may\r\nhave a similar color, but its hardness is only 4. In hydrochloric acid\r\nolivine decomposes to a gelatinous mass.\r\n\r\nOlivine is typically one of the constituents of the dark lavas, like\r\nbasalt, gabbro, or peridotite. It is also a common mineral in\r\nmeteorites. Olivine, in the presence of water, alters to other minerals,\r\nespecially serpentine, with great facility.\r\n\r\nIt occurs fairly widely wherever the dark lavas are present, as in the\r\nWhite Mountains of N. H., in Loudoun Co., Va., in Lancaster Co., Penn.,\r\nand in many localities in the Rocky Mountains and Cascade Range.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpidote\r\nCa₂(AlOH)(AlFe₂)(SiO₄)₃\r\nPl. 42\r\n\r\nOccurs in grains or columnar masses; hardness, 6.5; specific gravity\r\n3.4; color green, usually a pistachio or yellow-green; luster vitreous;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nRarely epidote occurs in crystals, which belong to the monoclinic\r\nsystem, and may be either short like the diagrams on plate 42 or long\r\nand needle-like. The color and hardness will suffice to determine this\r\nmineral, as almost no other has the peculiar yellowish-green color which\r\nis characteristic of this form.\r\n\r\nEpidote occurs primarily in metamorphic rocks at or near the contact\r\nwith igneous rocks; or it may be a secondary mineral resulting from the\r\nweathering of granites, especially along seams. It sometimes occurs with\r\nhornblende in highly folded schists, as in New York City. It is often a\r\nmineral which has resulted from the alteration of other minerals, as\r\npyroxene, amphibole, biotite, or even feldspars.\r\n\r\nIt is found at Chester and Athol, Mass., Haddam, Conn., Amity, Munroe\r\nand Warwick, N.Y., East Branch, Penn., in the Lake Superior region, in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTourmaline\r\n(FeCrNaKLi)₄Mg₁₂B₆Al₁₆H₈Si₁₂O₆₃\r\nPl. 42 & frontispiece\r\n\r\nOccurs in three-sided prismatic crystals; hardness, 7; specific gravity,\r\n3.1; colorless, red, green, brown, or black; luster vitreous;\r\ntransparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nTourmaline is readily distinguished from other minerals, as it always\r\noccurs in long to short prisms, which are three-sided in cross section.\r\nThere is also a tendency for the sides to be curved as seen on the end\r\nview of D, Pl. 42. Frequently the vertical edges of the prism are\r\nbeveled with one, two or three faces, grouped about each of the three\r\noriginal edges, and there are often striations on the prism faces. The\r\nends are terminated by a low rhombohedron and again there may be a host\r\nof modifying faces on the edges and corners of the end. The common\r\nvarieties are brown or black in color, but occasionally there may occur\r\ngreen, red, yellow or almost any color. When the crystals are perfect,\r\nthat is free from impurities and without tiny cracks, tourmaline becomes\r\na gem of popularity and value.\r\n\r\nTourmaline is very complex in composition and may vary considerably, the\r\nsodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, and iron being either more or\r\nless abundant or even lacking. The color is to some extent dependent on\r\nthe proportions of these elements present, the dark varieties having\r\nmore iron, and the light colored tourmalines lacking it. This mineral is\r\none of those which form from superheated vapors, escaping from molten\r\nmagmas. It will therefore occur in veins, often associated with copper\r\nminerals, in crystalline limestones, or in cavities in granites, where\r\nit is associated with such minerals, as beryl, apatite, fluorite, topaz,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIf heated tourmaline crystals develop electricity, with the effect of\r\nmaking one end a positive and the other a negative pole, and then will\r\nattract bits of straw, ashes, etc. It was first introduced into Europe\r\nabout 1703 from India, and its vogue as a gem has greatly increased\r\nsince it was found on Mount Mica near Paris, Me. This Paris, Me.,\r\nlocality was discovered by two boys, amateur mineralogists, Elijah L.\r\nHamlin and Ezekiel Holmes, who in 1820 were returning home from a trip\r\nhunting for minerals, when, at the root of a tree, they discovered some\r\ngleaming green substance. It proved to be gem-quality tourmaline. A snow\r\nstorm that night buried their “claim,” but next spring it was visited\r\nand several fine crystals found. Later this locality was systematically\r\nworked, and over $50,000 worth of tourmaline taken from the pegmatite\r\nseam in the granite, which lay under the crystals found on the surface.\r\nThe figure in the frontispiece is one of the crystals from there.\r\n\r\nWell known localities are Paris and Hebron, Me., Goshen and\r\nChesterfield, Mass., Acworth and Grafton, N. H., Haddam and Munroe,\r\nConn., Edenville and Port Henry, N. Y., Jefferson Co., Colo., San Diego\r\nCo., Calif., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nKaolinite\r\nH₄Al₂Si₂O₉\r\n_Kaolin_\r\n\r\nUsually found in whitish clay-like masses; hardness, 2; specific\r\ngravity, 2.6; color white to grayish or yellowish; luster dull.\r\n\r\nKaolinite does not generally occur in crystals, though crystals of\r\nmicroscopic size and monoclinic forms have been found. It is a secondary\r\nmineral resulting from the decomposition by weathering of feldspars, the\r\ncalcium, potassium or sodium having been replaced by water. When found\r\nin place it is generally white or nearly white, and is characterized by\r\nits greasy feel.\r\n\r\nAs granites or other feldspar-bearing rocks are weathered away, the\r\nkaolin is washed out by water, and with other fine material is carried\r\ndown into lakes or the sea, where it settles to the bottom and is known\r\nas clay. Clay is kaolin with more or less impurities.\r\n\r\nPure kaolin is used for the manufacture of china and white porcelain\r\nware; but when it is impure, especially when it has iron in it, baking\r\ncauses the product to turn red or brown, so that it is only suitable for\r\nmaking tile, bricks, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is found almost anywhere that feldspar rocks are, or have been,\r\nexposed to weathering.\r\n\r\n\r\nTalc\r\nH₂Mg₃(SiO₃)₄\r\n\r\nOccurs in scales, or in fibrous, scaly or compact masses; hardness, 1;\r\nspecific gravity, 2.7; color white, gray or pale-green; luster pearly;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is as soft as any, only graphite and molybdenite being of\r\nthe same hardness, but both these latter two have a black streak, while\r\nthe streak of talc is white. The greasy feel is also characteristic.\r\nTalc is very seldom found in crystals, but if they are found, they will\r\nappear like flakes and have a hexagonal cross section, though in reality\r\nthey belong to the monoclinic system.\r\n\r\nTalc is a secondary mineral which usually results from the exposure of\r\nmagnesium silicates, such as pyroxenes or amphiboles, to moisture. In\r\nthis case, in-as-much as the original rocks were metamorphic in origin,\r\nthe talc therefrom will occur in old metamorphic regions. Some talc is\r\nalso formed by the action of silica-bearing waters on dolomite. This is\r\nlikely to be the case near the contact between dolomite and igneous\r\nrocks. Talc is closely related to serpentine and likely to be found in\r\nthe same regions.\r\n\r\nTalc has come to have a considerable use. Some of it is compact and then\r\ncalled soapstone, and this was used by the ancient Chinese to make\r\nimages and ornaments; and our North American Indians used it to make\r\nlarge pots, to serve as containers for liquids. Some of these pots have\r\nbeen carved out with great skill, so as to be fairly light in proportion\r\nto what they would hold. Pipes and images were also carved from\r\nsoapstone. Today we still cut soapstone into slabs to make mantels,\r\nlaundry tubs and sinks. The scaly and fibrous varieties are ground, and\r\nused in making paper, paint, roofing, rubber, soap, crayons, toilet\r\npowders, etc. The United States produce and use over half the world’s\r\nproduction, our industries requiring over 100,000 tons of talc a year.\r\nOf this 38% goes into paper, 23% into paint, 18% into roofing, and so on\r\ndown to toilet powder which uses 2½%, or 2,500 tons a year.\r\n\r\nTalc is found in metamorphosed regions, that is in New England, all down\r\nthe east side of the Appalachian Mts., in the Rocky Mts., and the\r\nCascade Ranges, with a large number of local occurrences. New York State\r\nis the leading producer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpentine\r\nH₄Mg₃Si₂O₉\r\nPl. 43\r\n\r\nOccurs in compact, granular or fibrous masses; hardness, 3; specific\r\ngravity, 2.6; color green; luster greasy; translucent on thin edges.\r\nSerpentine is never in crystals. Its color and hardness serve to\r\ndistinguish it. Like talc it is a secondary mineral resulting from the\r\nalteration, in the presence of moisture, of pyroxenes, amphiboles, and\r\nespecially, olivine. As these are often in metamorphic rocks, the\r\nserpentine is likely to be associated with metamorphic rocks. Some\r\nserpentine is also the result of the action of silica-bearing water on\r\ndolomite, and this is likely to occur in areas of sedimentary rocks. The\r\nfibrous variety of serpentine, _chrysolite_, usually occurs in seams or\r\nveins, and when the fibers are long, it is used as asbestos. This form\r\nof asbestos is the one most used commercially today, as there are\r\nremarkably large deposits of it in the Province of Quebec, which provide\r\nthe major part of the world supply. In the United States it is also\r\nfound in California and Arizona but only in moderate quantities.\r\n\r\nMassive serpentine is used in considerable quantities as an ornamental\r\nstone, the green color varied with streaks and blotches of white, yellow\r\nand red, due to various impurities, making it very effective. It is,\r\nhowever, only suitable for interior work as the weather quickly spoils\r\nthe polished surface. This is further discussed under serpentine rock,\r\npage 245.\r\n\r\nSerpentine is found at Newfane, Vt., Newburyport, Mass., Brewster,\r\nAntwerp, etc., N. Y., Hoboken, N. J., in Pennsylvania, Maryland, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nChlorite\r\nH₈(MgFe)₅Al₂(SiO₆)₃\r\nPl. 43\r\n\r\nOccurs in monoclinic crystals of six-sided outline, or in scaly flakes\r\nor masses; hardness, 2; specific gravity 2.8; color green; luster pearly\r\non cleavage faces; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nChlorite is a family name, covering a series of closely related\r\nminerals, so similar in appearance that they are best considered under\r\nthis common name. In many respects they resemble mica, in the shape of\r\nthe crystals and the remarkable basal cleavage. At first glance it is\r\neasy to confuse the two, but chlorite scales are not elastic, and when\r\nbent, stay bent, instead of snapping back like mica. In fact they look\r\nlike more or less rotted micas. This is more than appearance, for\r\nchlorites form as a result of the alteration of micas in the presence of\r\nmoisture. They are then secondary, and will be found where mica-rocks\r\nhave been weathered, as in granites and schists.\r\n\r\nThey may be expected anywhere that micas have been long exposed, as in\r\nNew England, the Rocky Mountains, or the Sierra Nevada or Cascade\r\nRanges. Special localities are Brewster, N. Y., Unionville and Texas,\r\nPenn., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Zeolites\r\n\r\nThe zeolites are a group of white minerals, with a pearly luster, light\r\nweight, and easy solubility in acids; which, because their contained\r\nwater is lightly held, readily boil before the blowpipe. They are all\r\nsecondary minerals, which result from the decomposition of feldspars,\r\nwhen exposed to weathering. They are almost universally found in seams\r\nand cavities of disintegrating lavas. From a group of a dozen or so,\r\nthree are common enough to be considered here. They may be found by\r\nwatching such places, as where trap rock is being quarried for road\r\nmaterial, or being blasted for any reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalcite\r\nNa₃Al₂Si₄O₁₃ + 2H₂O\r\nPl. 44\r\n\r\nOccurs as trapezohedrons in seams and cavities in lavas; hardness, 5.5;\r\nspecific gravity, 2.2; colorless, white or pink; luster vitreous;\r\ntransparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nAnalcite usually occurs in the 24-sided form, known as a trapezohedron,\r\nas illustrated in figure A, Pl. 44; but it may also occur in cubes with\r\nthe three faces of the trapezohedron on each corner. Small crystals are\r\noften colorless, but the larger ones are either white or pink, and are\r\nopaque. While the form is the same as that of garnets, the color, lesser\r\nhardness, and the occurrence in lavas will serve to distinguish this\r\nmineral. If placed in hydrochloric acid analcite dissolves to a\r\ngelatinous mass.\r\n\r\nIt is always found in seams and cavities in lavas, as at Bergen Hill and\r\nWeehawken, N. J., Westfield, Mass., in the Lake Superior region, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatrolite\r\nNa₂Al₂Si₃O₁₀ + 2H₂O\r\nPlate 44\r\n\r\nOccurs as bristling crystals in seams and cavities in lavas; hardness,\r\n5.5; specific gravity, 2.2; colorless; luster vitreous; transparent on\r\nthin edges.\r\n\r\nNatrolite occurs as beautiful bristling tufts of needle-like crystals,\r\neach crystal an orthorhombic prism with a very low pyramid on the end.\r\nThis mineral is so easily fusible that it can be melted in a candle\r\nflame, giving to the flame the characteristic yellow color due to\r\nsodium. In hydrochloric acid it dissolves to a gelatinous mass. It is\r\nalways a secondary mineral in cavities and seams in disintegrating\r\nlavas, and the tuft-like manner of growth is so characteristic, that\r\nonce seen, it will always be recognized.\r\n\r\nNatrolite is found at Weehawken and Bergen Hill, N. J., at Westfield,\r\nMass., in the Lake Superior region, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nStilbite\r\nH₄(CaNa₂)Al₂(SiO₃)₆ + 4H₂O\r\nPl. 44\r\n\r\nUsually occurs in sheaf-like bundles of fibrous crystals; hardness, 5.5;\r\nspecific gravity 2.2; colorless to white, yellow or brown; luster\r\nvitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nStilbite crystals are really monoclinic, but on account of almost\r\nuniversal twinning, appear as if orthorhombic. Like the two foregoing\r\nminerals, stilbite is found in the seams and cavities of disintegrating\r\nlavas. It is readily recognized by its habit of forming in sheaf-like\r\nbundles of fibrous crystals. It may also, but more rarely, occur in\r\nradiating masses. In hydrochloric acid it is completely dissolved. It is\r\nfound in lavas, at Weehawken and Bergen Hill, N. J., in the Lake\r\nSuperior region, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Calcium\r\n\r\nCalcium is one of the most abundant of metals, but never occurs as such\r\nin nature, nor is it used as a metal by man. In its metallic form it is\r\nyellowish-white, and intermediate between lead and gold in hardness.\r\nExposed to air it soon tarnishes by oxidation, and in water rapidly\r\ndecomposes the water, forming the oxide. However, it has a great\r\naffinity for other elements, and makes a large number of minerals, the\r\nmost important of which are calcite, aragonite, gypsum and fluorite,\r\nwhile it is an essential component of some garnets, anorthite, epidote,\r\namphibole and pyroxene. It is very widely distributed as limestone, and\r\nis found in solution in most all natural waters, and in the shells and\r\nbones of many animals and some plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalcite\r\nCaCO₃\r\nPl. 45\r\n\r\nOccurs in well defined crystals in incrustations, and in stalactitic,\r\noolitic, and granular masses; hardness, 3; specific gravity 2.7;\r\ncolorless to white, or when impure, yellow, brown, green, red or blue;\r\nluster vitreous to dull; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nNext to quartz, calcite is the most abundant of all minerals, and occurs\r\nin an almost endless variety of forms, over 300 having been described.\r\nIt belongs to the hemihedral section of the hexagonal system, the form\r\nof the crystals being all sorts of variations of the rhombohedron, and\r\ncombinations of left and right handed rhombohedrons. The cleavage is\r\nentirely uniform, in three directions, parallel to the faces of the\r\nrhombohedron, and at an angle of 74° 55′ with each other. Crystals may\r\noccur in the form characteristic of the cleavage, but not often. The\r\ncommonest forms are a more or less elongated scalenohedron, made by\r\ncombining right and left handed rhombohedrons, so that the resulting\r\npyramid is six-sided, as in figure C, Plate 45. Such a scalenohedron may\r\nbe combined with other forms in a great variety of ways. The six-sided\r\nprism with the ends terminated by one or more sets of rhombohedral faces\r\nis also fairly common. Twinning occurs occasionally.\r\n\r\nThe quickest way to determine calcite is by the hardness (3), combined\r\nwith the fact that it effervesces, when hydrochloric acid is dropped\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of this mineral is its marked property of\r\ndeflecting light rays, so that a line or object placed behind a piece of\r\nclear calcite appears double. It was with pieces of calcite from Iceland\r\nthat this was first seen; so that large transparent crystals of calcite\r\nare still called _Iceland spar_; and such calcite is used to make the\r\nNichol’s prisms for microscopes, which are so useful in the study of\r\nminerals. This power of refracting light is present in all minerals, but\r\nnot to such a marked degree as in calcite. The elongated scalenohedrons\r\nof calcite are often called “dog-toothed spar” from a fancied\r\nresemblance between them and the dog’s tooth.\r\n\r\nCalcite is present in solution in the water of the sea and most streams,\r\nfrom which it is withdrawn by many animals and some plants, to make\r\ntheir shells, and bones. The foraminifera, some sponges, the\r\nechinoderms, corals and molluscs all draw large quantities from the\r\nwater in which they live, and build more or less permanent structures\r\nfrom it. These shells when they fall to the bottom, or after being\r\nbroken to bits, accumulate on the bottom and make limestone, which is\r\nwidely distributed over the country. This same limestone, when\r\nmetamorphosed and crystalline, is marble.\r\n\r\nCalcite then is readily soluble in water, and streams flowing along\r\ncrevices and fissures in limestone dissolve out great cavities or caves,\r\nlike the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky. Other water, percolating through the\r\nlimestone, comes to these cavities saturated with lime in solution and\r\ndrips from the roofs and walls; then as part of the water evaporates, it\r\ndeposits part of its lime in icicle-like masses, hanging from the roof.\r\nSuch masses of non-crystalline calcite are called _stalactites_. Below\r\non the floor of the cave, conical masses are built up in the same manner\r\nwhere the dripping water falls on the floor. These are _stalagmites_. In\r\nthese limestone caves and in smaller cavities many of the most beautiful\r\ncrystals grow. Somewhat similarly, when hot water from deep springs\r\ncomes to the surface, it cools and can not carry as much lime, and so\r\naround the spring is laid down layer after layer of non-crystalline\r\ncalcite making a mass known as _travertine_. Sometimes this is colored\r\nby iron or other impurities and a banded effect results. Such travertine\r\nas the “Suisun marble” from California, “California onyx,” “Mexican\r\nonyx,” and “satin spar” all belong to this class.\r\n\r\nThe coral animals, especially in tropical waters precipitate an enormous\r\namount of lime, until whole reefs are built of lime in this\r\nnon-crystalline form. In places it is hundreds of feet thick and\r\nhundreds of miles in extent. Some of this coral has become popular for\r\npersonal adornment. This is particularly a small, fine-grained variety,\r\n_Corallum rubrum_, which lives almost exclusively in the Mediterranean\r\nSea. This coral is red in color, varying all the way from a deep red to\r\nwhite. It grows in small masses, three pounds being a good sized mass,\r\nin water 60 to 100 feet deep, requires some ten years to develop a\r\nfull-sized mass. The making of this into beads and ornaments is an\r\nItalian industry. The demand is growing, while at the same time the\r\nsupply is diminishing, and search is being widely made for more such\r\ncoral, but up to the present time with little success. This precious\r\ncoral is much worn as a protection against the “evil eye” and is widely\r\nimitated, apparently with as much protection to the wearer. When coral\r\nbeads are offered cheap, they are probably something else, red gypsum\r\nbeing much used. This and all imitations can be readily detected by\r\ntrying a drop of acid in the bead. Coral will effervesce, but gypsum and\r\nother substitutes will not.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the shells of most molluscs is made of lime, but the\r\nmother-of-pearl layer inside is usually aragonite. The chalk of the\r\ncliffs on either side of the English channel is lime, and composed of\r\nthe shells of single celled animals. See p. 213. When lime is deposited\r\nin loose porous masses, as around grass, etc., and below hot springs,\r\nthis mass is termed _calcareous tufa_.\r\n\r\nCalcite will be found almost everywhere, some of the localities for the\r\nfinest crystals being Antwerp and Lockport, N. Y., Middletown, Conn.,\r\nthe caves of Kentucky, Warsaw, Ill., Joplin, Mo., Hazel Green, Wis.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAragonite\r\nCaCO₃\r\nPl. 46\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals, in columnar or fibrous masses, or incrustations;\r\nhardness, 3.5; specific gravity, 2.9; colorless, white or amber; luster\r\nvitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nAragonite has the same chemical composition as calcite, but it\r\ncrystallizes in the orthorhombic system, either in simple forms like A\r\non Plate 46, or twinned, so as to make forms which seem hexagonal. When\r\nin simple crystals its form easily distinguishes it from calcite and\r\ndolomite, but when twinned it appears much like either of these two\r\nminerals. From calcite it can then be distinguished by its greater\r\nhardness and the fact that it has cleavage in one direction only, and\r\nthat imperfect. The cleavage is the only easy method of distinguishing\r\nit from dolomite. However, aragonite is most always easily distinguished\r\nby its habits, for it generally forms long slender crystals, which\r\nappear more like fibers than crystals. Neither calcite nor dolomite is\r\nat all fibrous.\r\n\r\nAragonite is much less abundant than calcite, and has resulted, either\r\nfrom deposition from hot waters, or from waters having sulphates in\r\nsolution as well as lime. Much of the travertine, and many stalagmites\r\nand stalactites are composed of aragonites, forming as outlined under\r\ncalcite. The mother-of-pearl layer in the shells of bivalves is\r\ngenerally aragonite. The pearly luster of this layer is due to its being\r\nformed by the successive deposition of one thin layer upon another; so\r\nthat light falling on the mother-of-pearl, penetrates, part of it to one\r\nlayer and part to another, and is then reflected. Certain molluscs have\r\nthis layer composed of especially thin layers, one, the _Unios_ or\r\nfreshwater clams, the other, the “pearl oysters” or _Aviculidæ_, these\r\nlatter, however, being only distantly related to the edible oysters. In\r\nthe cases, where molluscs of either of these two families are of large\r\nsize, large pieces of mother-of-pearl can be recovered, and are used for\r\nbuttons, handles, and various ornamental objects. A further peculiarity\r\nof these same molluscs is the formation of pearls in the sheet of flesh,\r\nlining the shells. The pearls are round or rounded concretions of\r\naragonite. At the center there is a grain of sand, or more often a tiny\r\ndead parasite. Either was an irritant to the mollusc, and to be rid of\r\nit, a layer of aragonite was secreted around it. Then as the mollusc\r\ncontinued to grow and secrete layers for its shell, it also added each\r\ntime another layer around the sand-grain or parasite, until in time a\r\npearl of noticeable, and then of considerable size resulted. These have\r\nall the pearly luster of the mother-of-pearl in a sphere which tends to\r\nmake the luster even more marked.\r\n\r\nPearls were in use as ornaments in China some twenty-three centuries\r\nbefore Christ, and in India over 500 B.C. They were very highly prized\r\nby the Romans and since their times the rulers of India have shown a\r\nremarkable fondness for them. Today the finest come from the Gulf of\r\nPersia and the Red Sea, while still others are found about Australia and\r\nin the Caribbean Sea. In the United States not a few are collected every\r\nyear from the fresh water clams, some of them beautifully tinted with\r\npink or yellow.\r\n\r\nAragonite is found widely, as at Haddam, Conn., Edenville, N. Y.,\r\nHoboken, N. J., New Garden, Penn., Warsaw, Ill., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnhydrite\r\nCaSO₄\r\nPl. 46\r\n\r\nOccurs in cleavable or granular masses, rarely in crystals; hardness,\r\n3-3.5; specific gravity, 2.9; color white, gray, bluish or reddish;\r\nluster pearly on cleavage faces; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nWhen anhydrite occurs in crystals, they are orthorhombic, like the\r\ndiagram on Plate 46. Usually, however, it is found in beds or layers,\r\nwhich were deposited by the evaporation of sea water, and so it is\r\nassociated with salt. Anhydrite has three cleavage planes which are at\r\nright angles to one another, which produce rectangular or cube-like\r\nforms. Mostly anhydrite is associated with gypsum, from which it differs\r\nby its greater hardness, pseudo-cubic cleavage, and the fact that\r\nanhydrite is not readily soluble in acid, while gypsum is. Chemically it\r\ndiffers from gypsum in not having water of crystallization, which gypsum\r\ndoes have. The anhydrite is likely to occur as veins and irregular\r\nmasses in beds of gypsum. Calcium sulphate is precipitated from sea\r\nwater when 37% of the water has been evaporated, and it may be deposited\r\neither as anhydrite or as gypsum, the factors, which decide as to which\r\nof these two minerals it will be, being as yet unknown. After\r\ndeposition, if exposed to moisture, the anhydrite may change to gypsum,\r\nirregular masses often remaining unchanged.\r\n\r\nIt is found in salt mines in Elsworth Co., Kan., in limestone cavities\r\nat Lockport, N. Y., in veins in Shasta Co., Calif., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nGypsum\r\nCaSO₄ + 2H₂O\r\nPl. 47\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals, in cleavable masses, or in fibrous masses; hardness,\r\n2; specific gravity, 2.3; colorless, white, amber, gray, or pink; luster\r\nvitreous, silky or pearly; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nGypsum crystals are monoclinic as seen on Plate 47, the perfect ones\r\nusually occurring in clay, as at Oxford, O., or in cavities; while\r\ncrystals of less perfect outline, but with fine cleavages, are found in\r\nUtah, Kansas, and Colorado. The cleavage is very perfect in one\r\ndirection, making it possible to strip off thin sheets almost like mica,\r\nand less perfect in two other directions, which appear on the smooth\r\nsurface of the first cleavage as lines intersecting at 66° 14′. Twinning\r\nis also common in such a way, that the two united crystals make forms\r\nsimilar to arrowheads. These cleavages and the twinning show nicely in\r\nthe photograph of gypsum on Plate 47.\r\n\r\nGypsum is distinguished from anhydrite by its lesser hardness, its\r\ncleavage and by being soluble in acids.\r\n\r\nMost gypsum occurs in beds or granular masses which were deposited from\r\nevaporating sea-water, coming down when 37% of the water was lost. Such\r\nbeds are often very extensive and are quarried as a source of gypsum to\r\nmake plaster of Paris, stucco, neat plaster, Keene’s cement, plaster and\r\nwall board, partition tiles, etc. The use of the gypsum for plaster of\r\nParis and all these other uses is based on its affinity for water of\r\ncrystallization. The gypsum is first heated to about 400° C., which\r\ndrives off the water of crystallization, and causes it to crumble to a\r\npowder, which is the plaster of Paris. When water is added, it is taken\r\nup and the powder “sets,” or recrystallizes back to gypsum. This simple\r\nreaction has made it very useful, for making moulds, casts, hard finish\r\non walls, as stucco, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the granular type of gypsum is fine grained, it is known as\r\n_alabaster_, which is used for carving vases, statuettes, ornaments,\r\netc. The fibrous variety is called _satin spar_, and is sometimes used\r\nfor cheap jewelry and ornaments, but it is very soft and quickly wears\r\nout. At Niagara Falls there is a considerable trade in objects carved\r\nfrom this satin spar, tourists buying them on the assumption that the\r\nmineral is native and comes from under the falls. Most of it, however,\r\ncomes from Wales, the small amount of gypsum of that region being mostly\r\ngranular.\r\n\r\nGypsum is found all across the United States, as in New York, Michigan,\r\nVirginia, Ohio, Alabama, South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,\r\nCalifornia, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Strontium Group\r\n\r\nStrontium is a pale-yellow metal, ductile and malleable, but oxidizing\r\nquickly when exposed to the air. It does not occur in its native state\r\nin Nature, but always as some compound, usually either the carbonate or\r\nsulphate. It resembles barium, but differs in giving to the flame a\r\nbrilliant red color, on which account the compounds of strontium are\r\nused mostly in making red fire in fireworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrontianite\r\nSrCO₃\r\n\r\nOccurs in needle-like crystals, or in columnar or fibrous masses;\r\nhardness, 3.5-4; specific gravity, 3.6; color white, pale-green or pale\r\nshades of yellow; luster vitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nStrontianite is orthorhombic, but appears as if hexagonal, since its\r\ngeneral habit is to have three twin crystals grow together in such a way\r\nas to make a six-sided double pyramid. In this it is very like\r\nwitherite, both these minerals appearing externally much alike. They can\r\nbe readily distinguished, however, by holding a piece in the flame. If\r\nit gives a red color to the flame it is strontianite, if green, it is\r\nwitherite. It effervesces readily in hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nStrontianite is found in veins and cavities in limestone, where it has\r\nbeen deposited after being leached from the limestone by percolating\r\nwaters. Though known at several localities it is not now being mined in\r\nthis country, what we use being imported mostly from Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is found at Schoharie, Chaumont Bay and Theresa, N. Y., in Mifflin\r\nCo., Penn., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCelestite\r\nSrSO₄\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals, cleavable masses and fibrous; hardness, 3; specific\r\ngravity, 3.9; colorless, white, pale-blue, or reddish; luster vitreous;\r\ntransparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nCelestite, the sulphate of strontium, is very like barite in external\r\nappearance and habit. It is orthorhombic and occurs in tabular crystals.\r\nIts cleavage is perfect on the basal plane, and imperfect in one other\r\ndirection. The ready way of distinguishing celestite from barite is to\r\nhold a piece in the flame. If it is celestite it will color the flame\r\nred, if barite, green.\r\n\r\nCelestite is mostly found in veins or cavities in limestone, where it\r\nhas been deposited by percolating waters, after having been leached from\r\nthe limestone. Some years ago an important deposit of celestite was\r\nfound on Strontian Island in Lake Erie, but that was soon worked out and\r\nnow no veins are being worked in this country. It is also found at\r\nChaumont Bay, Schoharie and Lockport, N. Y., in Kansas, Texas, West\r\nVirginia, Tennessee, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Barium Group\r\n\r\nBarium is another metal which does not occur in its native state in\r\nNature. It has only been isolated as a yellow powder, which, exposed to\r\nair or water, soon changes to one of the oxides. Both barium and its\r\ncompounds are peculiar in causing a green color, whenever exposed to the\r\nflame. Two of its compounds are fairly abundant, the sulphate, barite,\r\nand the carbonate, witherite. The former is the more abundant and has\r\ncome to be fairly widely used, something over 100,000 tons being\r\nannually consumed in the United States, to make the body in flat finish\r\npaints for interior work and light colors, for a filler in rubber goods,\r\nlinoleum, oil cloth, glazed paper, and for a wide range of chemical\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarite\r\nBaSO₄\r\nPl. 48\r\n_heavy spar_\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals or in lamellar, nodular or granular masses; hardness\r\n3; specific gravity, 4.5; colorless, white or almost any color; luster\r\nvitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nBarite occurs in orthorhombic crystals, which are tabular in form, and\r\nusually have the edges beveled, as in figure A, Plate 48. There is\r\ncleavage in three directions, a rather perfect basal cleavage, and two\r\nless perfect cleavages, which are at right angles to the basal cleavage\r\nplane, and intersect each other at 78°.\r\n\r\nThe tabular form, the cleavage, the heavy weight, and the fact that a\r\npiece of barite put into the flame colors it green, all serve to\r\ndistinguish this mineral.\r\n\r\nBarite is a secondary mineral of aqueous origin, which has been\r\ndeposited in veins and cavities in igneous, metamorphic, or sometimes\r\nsedimentary rocks. It is most likely to occur in veins in igneous or\r\nmetamorphic rocks, the barium having been dissolved from certain\r\nfeldspars and micas by percolating water, and then redeposited in the\r\nfissures, as the water came into them. If in sedimentary rocks, the\r\nbarite veins are usually in limestones. Barite is quite likely to be a\r\ngangue mineral for the ores of lead.\r\n\r\nIt is found at Hatfield and Leverett, Mass., Cheshire, Conn., Pillar\r\nPoint, N. Y., Cartersville, Ga., in Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Illinois, Wisconsin,\r\nNevada, California, Alaska, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWitherite\r\nBaCO₃\r\nPl. 48\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals, or in granular or columnar masses; hardness, 3.5;\r\nspecific gravity, 4.3; color white to gray; luster vitreous; translucent\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nWitherite is not an abundant mineral. Its crystals are really\r\northorhombic, but they are usually twinned, three crystals growing\r\nthrough each other in such a manner that the resulting crystal appears\r\nlike a six-sided double pyramid, similar to the one figured on Plate 48.\r\nThe commonest mode of occurrence is in compact masses. Witherite\r\neffervesces when cold acid is dropped upon it, which, with its heavy\r\nweight, and the green color it gives to the flame, serves to distinguish\r\nthe mineral. It is used for medicines, in chemical industries, and a\r\nconsiderable amount is made into rat poisons. The chief locality for\r\nwitherite is in northern England, but in this country it is found along\r\nwith barite, especially at Lexington, Ky., and in Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Carbon\r\n\r\nCarbon is an element widely distributed in nature, occasionally\r\nappearing in its elementary form, as graphite or the diamond, but much\r\nmore important in its compounds. Small quantities are present in the air\r\nas carbon dioxide, CO₂, immense quantities occurring in the carbonate\r\nminerals, which have been considered under their respective metallic\r\nsalts, as calcite, malachite, siderite, cerrusite, smithsonite,\r\nwitherite, etc., and still other large quantities being represented in\r\norganic compounds, which occur as rocks under the heads of petroleum,\r\ncoal, etc. The occurrence of limestones, graphite, coal or petroleum is\r\nalways indicative of the activity of living organisms, and in some cases\r\nis the only indication of life in the earlier rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGraphite\r\nC\r\n_Plumbago_\r\n\r\nOccurs in hexagonal scales or flakes, in layered masses, or earthy\r\nlumps; hardness, 1; specific gravity, 2.1; color black or steel-gray;\r\nstreak gray; luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.\r\n\r\nLike the diamond graphite is pure carbon, but in this case it is in\r\nnon-crystalline form. It occurs in both igneous and metamorphic rocks.\r\nIn the former case it is either in flakes in the rock, or in veins, and\r\nhas been derived directly from the molten magmas, having either\r\nprecipitated in the hardening granite or lava, or having been carried\r\ninto the fissures and there precipitated to make the veins of graphite.\r\nIn either case the graphite probably represents organic deposits which\r\nhave been melted into the igneous magma at the time of its formation.\r\nGraphite may also occur in metamorphic rocks, beds of coal or other\r\norganic deposits being altered by the heat. Such beds are often of\r\nconsiderable extent and economic importance.\r\n\r\nThe extreme softness, greasy feel, and the dark-gray streak readily\r\ndistinguish graphite.\r\n\r\nIt is widely used in making crucibles and furnace linings for foundries,\r\nlead pencils, paint, lubricating powders, etc.\r\n\r\nGraphite is found at Brandon, Vt., Sturbridge, Mass., Ashford, Conn., in\r\nEssex, Warren and Washington Cos., N. Y., Clay, Chilton and Coosa Cos.,\r\nAla., Raton, N. M., Dillon, Mont., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiamond\r\nC\r\n\r\nOccurs in octahedral crystals; hardness, 10; specific gravity, 3.5;\r\ncolorless to yellow, brown, blue, etc., luster adamantine; transparent\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nLike graphite the diamond is pure carbon, but in this case in crystal\r\nform. It is the hardest of all minerals, and as brilliant as any; so\r\nthat in spite of being by no means the rarest, it may easily be\r\nconsidered the most popular of all gems. Tiny diamonds have been made\r\nartificially under great heat and pressure; so that this mineral is\r\nthought of as forming in Nature in dark igneous lavas at great depths.\r\nThe diamond has good cleavage parallel to the octahedron faces, and, in\r\nspite of some traditions to the contrary, is brittle.\r\n\r\nThere are not many diamond localities, the most famous being the\r\nKimberley district of South Africa, which produces many times as many\r\ndiamonds as all the others put together, though all the time some are\r\nbeing found in Borneo and Brazil. A very few have been found in the\r\nUnited States, only one locality however yielding them in the original\r\nmatrix. That is at Murfreesboro, Ark., where they are mined in a\r\ndisintegrating peridotite (a dark lava, mostly peridot), which has been\r\nextruded through the sedimentary rocks of that region. This matrix is\r\nsimilar to the “blue earth,” the matrix of the diamonds of South Africa,\r\nwhich occurs in “pipes,” representing the necks of ancient volcanoes.\r\nThe American diamonds are of small size, averaging considerably less\r\nthan a third of a carat in weight, which does not allow great value to\r\nthe individual diamonds.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, especially large diamonds have been found in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, the largest being the Cullinan diamond,\r\nfound at the Premier Diamond Mine of South Africa. It weighed 3025\r\ncarats or about a pound and a quarter, and was valued at over\r\n$3,000,000. It was presented to King Edward VII, who had it cut into 11\r\nbrilliants, four of which are larger than any other diamond yet found.\r\nOther famous diamonds, like the Kohinoor, 106 carats, found in India in\r\n1304; the Regent, 136 carats, also found in India; the Orloff, 193\r\ncarats, set in the eye of an Indian idol; the South Star, 125 carats,\r\nthe largest ever found in Brazil; the blue Hope, etc., have in many\r\ncases romantic and interesting stories woven about them.\r\n\r\nThough for ages diamonds have been highly prized gems, it is only in\r\ncomparatively recent times that cutting and polishing have been resorted\r\nto, for the purpose of enhancing their brilliancy. This is done by\r\ngrinding reflecting faces on the original stone, by the aid of discs of\r\niron or tin in which diamond dust has been embedded. Diamond chips and\r\ncloudy or imperfect diamonds are used for making tools for cutting\r\nglass, rock drills, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Phosphorus\r\n\r\nThe element phosphorus at ordinary temperatures is an almost colorless,\r\nfaintly yellow, solid substance of glistening appearance and waxy\r\nconsistency. In Nature it does not occur pure, but always as one of its\r\ncompounds. It is of great importance to man for it is one of the\r\nessentials for plant growth and also for the higher animals, being\r\nrequired for the bones and to some extent for nervous tissue. Originally\r\nit is found in all the igneous rocks. Some of the phosphorus is removed\r\nby solution and carried to other regions and to the sea. From this\r\ndistribution it comes into the sedimentary rocks, and, when they are\r\naltered by heat, into the metamorphic rocks. Thus it has a wide, though\r\nby no means even, distribution. The soils formed by disintegration of\r\nthese rocks probably all have some phosphorus in them; but where there\r\nis vigorous plant growth, it soon tends to become exhausted, and must be\r\nrenewed. For this reason the use of phosphates has become of prime\r\nimportance in Agriculture. The possession of beds of rock carrying\r\nphosphorus has come to be of international importance. The United States\r\nis particularly fortunate in this respect, and produces over 25% of the\r\nworld’s supply of phosphates. Most all the phosphorus is recovered\r\neither from phosphate minerals, the most important of which is apatite,\r\nor from the non-crystalline and impure mixtures of phosphate minerals\r\nand other substances, discussed under phosphate rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nApatite\r\nCa₅F(PO₄)₃\r\nPl. 49\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals, concretionary nodules, or in bedded masses;\r\nhardness, 5; specific gravity, 3.2; color reddish-brown or green, rarely\r\nwhite or colorless; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nApatite occurs in hexagonal prisms, usually with the ends truncated by a\r\nbasal plane, and with one or more sets of pyramidal faces between the\r\nprism and the basal plane. Crystals range in size from tiny to over a\r\nfoot in diameter. There is but one cleavage and that is basal. The\r\ncrystal form, cleavage, and hardness will easily determine this mineral.\r\nApatite is usually associated with igneous or highly metamorphic rocks,\r\nsuch as granites, gneisses, and crystalline limestones. While the\r\nphosphoric acid of apatite is highly desirable for use in fertilizers,\r\nthe crystals do not occur in sufficient abundance to make them\r\ncommercially available, and non-crystalline phosphate rocks are resorted\r\nto for this purpose.\r\n\r\nCrystals of apatite are found at Norwich and Bolton, Mass., Rossie and\r\nEdenville, N. Y., Suckasunny and Hurdstown, N. J., Leiperville, Penn.,\r\nWilmington, Del., etc. Templeton, Canada, is perhaps the best known\r\nlocality for fine apatite.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurquois\r\nH₅[Al(OH)₂]Cu(OH)(PO₄)₄\r\n\r\nOccurs in seams and incrustations; hardness, 6; specific gravity, 2.7;\r\ncolor bluish-green; streak blue; luster waxy; translucent to opaque on\r\nthin edges.\r\n\r\nIn this country this complex phosphate of aluminum and copper is found\r\nin streaks and patches in volcanic rocks, but in Persia comes from\r\nmetamorphic rocks. To the Persians it was a magical stone, protecting\r\nthe wearer from injuries, and among the Pueblo Indians it was regarded\r\nas of religious value in warding off evil. The best turquois comes from\r\nPersia, but it has been found at several points in the United States, as\r\nin Los Cerrillos and Burro Mts., N. M., in Mohave Co., Ariz., San\r\nBernardino Co., Cal., in Nevada and Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Fluorine\r\n\r\nAt ordinary temperatures the element fluorine is a colorless gas, which\r\nwas not obtained pure until 1888, because it could not be contained in\r\nvessels of glass, gold, platinum, etc. At that time it was made and kept\r\nin a vessel composed of an alloy of platinum and iridium. Its most\r\nimportant compound is hydrofluoric acid, a fuming liquid, which is\r\nmostly used to etch or dissolve glass. It occurs in several minerals,\r\nlike tourmaline, turquois, etc., but the only one used to obtain the\r\nhydrofluoric acid is fluorite.\r\n\r\n\r\nFluorite\r\nCaF₂\r\nPl. 50\r\n_Fluor spar_\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals and cleavable masses; hardness, 4; specific gravity,\r\n3.2; colorless or some shade of violet, green, yellow, or rose; luster\r\nvitreous; transparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nFluorite usually occurs in beautiful cubic crystals, often with the\r\nedges and corners beveled by smaller faces, and occasionally in twins,\r\nwhich seem to have grown through each other. There is perfect cleavage\r\nparallel to each of the octahedral faces, which often, as in the\r\nillustration on Plate 50, show as cracks cutting off the corners.\r\n\r\nSince fluorite loses weight and color on heating, it is concluded that\r\nthe colors are due to the presence of hydrocarbon compounds. The red and\r\nthe green fluorite when heated to above 212° F. become phosphorescent,\r\nas may be seen if they are thus heated and exposed to the light, then\r\ntaken into the dark.\r\n\r\nFluorite is quite commonly the gangue mineral associated with metallic\r\nores, and is also likely to occur with topaz, apatite, etc. It is\r\ngenerally in such places that it seems to have been deposited from hot\r\nvapors, rising from igneous magmas.\r\n\r\nIt is the only mineral at all common from which fluorine can be\r\nobtained, and is used for making hydrofluoric acid, and other chemical\r\ncompounds of this element. It is, however, of much greater importance as\r\na flux in reducing iron, silver, lead and copper ores. In the industries\r\nit finds a place, being used to make apochromatic lenses, cheap jewelry,\r\nand for the electrodes in flaming arc lamps.\r\n\r\nFluorite is widely distributed, some of the better known localities\r\nbeing Trumbull and Plymouth, Conn., Rossie and Muscalonge Lake, N. Y.,\r\nGallatin Co., Ill., Thunder Bay, Lake Superior, Missouri, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalite\r\nNaCl\r\nPl. 50\r\n_Salt_\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals, and in cleavable and granular masses; hardness, 2.5;\r\nspecific gravity, 2.1; colorless to white; luster vitreous; transparent\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nHalite is common salt, occurring in cubic crystals, with perfect cubic\r\ncleavage. Its form, hardness, taste, and solubility in water make it\r\neasy to determine.\r\n\r\nHalite is the most abundant salt in sea water, making about 2.5% out of\r\nthe total of 3.5% of solids in solution. It is also a prominent, when\r\nnot the leading, salt in solution in the waters of inland lakes, like\r\nGreat Salt Lake, or the Dead Sea, there being 20% of halite in the\r\nformer and 8% in the latter, though the total of solid in solution in\r\nthe water of the Dead Sea is greater than that in Great Salt Lake.\r\n\r\nThe great salt deposits are mostly the result of the evaporation of the\r\nwater of arms or isolated portions of former oceans; the salt, gypsum,\r\netc., left by the drying sea, having been buried beneath later\r\nsediments. Other bodies of salt represent the disappearance of ancient\r\nlakes. There are also the curious “salt domes” of Louisiana and Texas,\r\nwhich are immense, roughly circular, subterranean masses of salt\r\nextending to as yet unknown depths which are thought to have been formed\r\nby masses of salt from some deep source bed pushing their way upward\r\nthrough the overlying formations by plastic flowage. As the upthrust\r\ntook place the sediments were arched into domes. Some of these domes are\r\ntoday important sources of rock salt.\r\n\r\nThere are extensive beds of salt under parts of New York, Michigan,\r\nOhio, Oklahoma, Kansas, etc., which are mostly worked by drilling wells\r\ninto the salt layer, then introducing hot water to dissolve the salt.\r\nThe brine thus formed is pumped to the surface, and the salt recovered\r\nby evaporation in pans. During the process, skeleton crystals of salt\r\nwith concave faces may form, but in Nature the crystals are uniformly\r\nsolid cubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoracite\r\nMg₇Cl₂B₁₆O₃₀\r\n\r\nOccurs in small crystals or granular masses; hardness of crystals, 7; of\r\nthe masses, 4.5; specific gravity 3; colorless to white; luster\r\nvitreous; transparent to translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nSmall crystals, associated with salt and gypsum, occur in the beds and\r\nincrustations, which result from the drying up of alkaline lakes,\r\nespecially in Nevada and southern California. The crystals are\r\northorhombic, but appear like perfect cubes, with the edges beveled and\r\npart of the corners cut. They are not easily dissolved in water, but\r\nquickly go into solution in hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nColemanite\r\nCa₂B₆O₁₁ + 5H₂O\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals or compact masses; hardness, 4.5; specific gravity,\r\n2.4; colorless to white; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThe crystals when they occur, are monoclinic; but usually colemanite is\r\na bedded deposit, which has resulted from the drying up of a saline\r\nlake. It was first found in Death Valley, Cal., in 1882, then near\r\nDaggett, Cal., and since then in several similar locations in Nevada and\r\nOregon. The deposits are of all grades of purity, the colemanite being\r\nmixed with varying quantities of mud. Today this mineral is the chief\r\nsource of borax, which is used in medicines, cosmetics, colored glazes,\r\nenamel, and as a preservative.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorax\r\nNaB₄O₇ + 10H₂O\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals or in powdery incrustations; hardness, 2; specific\r\ngravity, 1.7; colorless to white; luster vitreous; translucent on thin\r\nedges.\r\n\r\nThe crystals are tiny and monoclinic, this mineral being usually\r\nobtained by the evaporation of the saline waters of such lakes as Clear\r\nand Borax Lakes in southern California, or from the muds of salt\r\nmarshes, like Searles Borax Marsh in California. Originally most of our\r\nborax came from a large saline lake in Tibet, but now most of it is\r\nobtained from colemanite. Borax is soluble in water, giving it a\r\nsweetish taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nSulphur\r\nS\r\nPl. 51\r\n\r\nOccurs in crystals, incrustations or compact masses; hardness, 2;\r\nspecific gravity, 2; color yellow; streak yellow; luster resinous;\r\ntranslucent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nAside from the numerous compounds, such as the sulphides of the metals\r\nlike pyrite, galena, sphalerite, etc., and the sulphates, like gypsum,\r\nbarite, anglesite, etc., sulphur occurs in its elemental form in Nature.\r\nIn this case it may be in crystals, which are orthorhombic and usually\r\noccur as octahedrons, with the upper and lower ends truncated, either by\r\na basal plane, or by a lower octahedron, or by both. Incrustations and\r\ncompact masses are, however, much the commoner mode of occurrence. The\r\nincrustations are found mostly about volcanic regions, where the sulphur\r\nhas risen from the molten lavas as a sublimate, and on cooling has been\r\ndeposited in crevices or on the adjacent surfaces. Irregular masses of\r\nsulphur are often found where sulphide minerals, like pyrite or galena\r\nhave been decomposed in such a way as to leave the sulphur behind. The\r\nextensive beds of sulphur are usually associated with gypsum, and are\r\nthought to be the result of water, containing bituminous matter, so\r\nacting on gypsum as to remove the calcium and oxygen as lime, and leave\r\nthe sulphur. Finally many waters carry sulphates in solution, from which\r\nthe sulphur may be precipitated by certain sulphur bacteria, making thus\r\nincrustations on the bottom of ponds or lakes.\r\n\r\nSulphur is used for making matches, gunpowder, fireworks, insecticides,\r\nin medicine, vulcanizing rubber, etc. It is widely distributed, however,\r\nmost of the present world’s production is from deposits associated with\r\nthe “salt domes” of Texas and Louisiana. A “caprock” of gypsum and\r\nanhydrite overlies many of these which often contains elemental sulphur.\r\nWells are drilled into this, and the sulphur is melted by the\r\nintroduction of hot steam. This melted sulphur is then pumped to the\r\nsurface and run into molds.\r\n\r\nSome of the best known localities are Sulphurdale, Utah, Cody and\r\nThermopolis, Wyo., Santa Barbara Co., Cal., Humboldt Co., Nev., and\r\nabout the hot springs of the Yellowstone Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nIce\r\nH₂O\r\nPl. 51\r\n_water_\r\n\r\nOccurs solid as ice, snow and frost, or liquid as water; hardness, 2;\r\nspecific gravity, .92; colorless to white; luster adamantine;\r\ntransparent on thin edges.\r\n\r\nThough we seldom think of ice, and its liquid form, water, as a mineral,\r\nstill it is one, and perhaps the most important of all minerals, as well\r\nas the most common. Ice melts at 32° F. and vaporizes at 212° F., being\r\nthen termed steam. Because it is so common and liquid at ordinary\r\ntemperatures it acts as a solvent for a host of other minerals, and is\r\ntherefore the agent by which they are transported from place to place\r\nand redeposited in veins and beds.\r\n\r\nNot only does water act as a transportation agent for minerals in\r\nsolution, but is also the agent of erosion and weathering. Water\r\nvaporizes slowly when exposed to the air at all temperatures above\r\nfreezing, and so it is slowly rising from the surface of the sea or\r\nlakes or moist ground into the air, where it would accumulate until the\r\nair was saturated, if the air would only keep still and at a uniform\r\ntemperature. The air will hold a given amount of water vapor, which is,\r\nfor example, 17 grams per cubic meter when the temperature is 68° F.,\r\nbut at 59° F. it will hold only 12½ grams, or at 50° F. only 9 grams.\r\nThus the air is more or less completely saturated at higher\r\ntemperatures, and when the temperature is lowered the air can not hold\r\nall it has taken up, and it is precipitated in dew, rain or snow, most\r\noften as rain. When the rain falls it mechanically carries away, and\r\nmore or less slowly transports to other places particles of rock, being\r\nthus the agent of erosion; and when it is slowed down, as on entering\r\nthe quiet water of a lake or the sea, it drops the mechanically carried\r\nsediment and makes sedimentary deposits.\r\n\r\nAnother very important and unique feature of water is that on freezing\r\nit expands about ¹/₁₁th of its former bulk, so that, as a result, ice\r\nfloats, and also wherever water in crevices is frozen, the crevices are\r\nenlarged. In locations where this freezing and melting take place\r\nrepeatedly throughout a year, there the breaking up of rocks is rapid.\r\n\r\nThis is hardly the place to take up a complete discussion of water, but\r\nits action as a solvent, mechanically, and in freezing, melting, and\r\nvaporizing is the basis of a large part of the study of geology.\r\n\r\nWhen water crystallizes, as in forming ice, it is in the hexagonal\r\nsystem. It tends to twinning and a snow-flake is made up of a large\r\nnumber of twinned crystals, each diverging from the other at 60°. When\r\nice is formed in the air or on the surface of water it forms these\r\ncomplex and beautiful multiple twins, of which but a couple are\r\nsuggested here. Beneath the surface the hexagonal crystals grow downward\r\ninto the water, parallel to each other, making a fibrous structure,\r\nwhich is very apparent when ice is “rotten,” which is the time at which\r\nthe surfaces of the prisms are separating, because the molecules leave\r\nthe crystal in the reverse order to which they united with it. Frost in\r\nmarshy or spongy ground will often show this fibrous growth beautifully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                               THE ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking a rock is an essential part of the crust of the earth,\r\nand includes loose material, like sand, mud, or volcanic ashes, as well\r\nas compact and solid masses, like sandstone and granite. Rocks are\r\naggregates of minerals, either several minerals grouped together, as are\r\nmica, quartz and feldspar to make granite, or large quantities of a\r\nsingle mineral, like quartz grains to make sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe rocks are most conveniently classified according to their mode of\r\norigin, into three main groups, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.\r\nThe igneous rocks are those which have solidified from a molten magma,\r\nlike lavas, granites, etc. The sedimentary rocks are those which\r\nrepresent accumulations of fragments or grains, derived from various\r\nsources, usually the weathering of other rocks, and deposited by such\r\nagents as water, wind and organisms. Metamorphic rocks are those which\r\nwere originally either igneous or sedimentary, but have been altered by\r\nthe actions of heat, pressure and water, so that the primary character\r\nhas been changed, often to such an extent as to be obscured.\r\n\r\nRocks once formed in any of the above ways are being constantly altered\r\nin character by the various processes of nature. Those exposed on the\r\nsurface are weathered to pieces, and the fragments are transported by\r\nwind or water to accumulate elsewhere as sedimentary rocks. Those buried\r\ndeep beneath the surface are affected by the high temperature and\r\npressure of the depths of the earth and thus metamorphosed. For instance\r\na granite exposed on the surface is slowly weathered, some parts being\r\ncarried away in solution by the rain water, others less soluble\r\nremaining as grains of quartz, mica or kaolin. These are transported by\r\nwater and sorted, the finer kaolin being carried to still and deep\r\nwater, the quartz and mica accumulating in some lowland as sand. This\r\nsand will in time be cemented to a sandstone, later slowly buried\r\nbeneath the surface. If buried deep it will feel the effect of the\r\ninterior temperature, which increases as one goes down at the rate of\r\none degree F. for every 50 feet. If this should be in a region where\r\nfolding and mountain-making takes place, the material under the folds\r\nwould be melted (because of the relief from pressure which would permit\r\nthe high temperature to act freely) and become igneous rock, either\r\ncoming to the surface as lava, or remaining below the surface and making\r\na granite or similar rock; while the sedimentary material not melted but\r\nnear enough to the molten material to be affected, would be\r\nmetamorphosed, in this case to a quartzite. Much of the interest and\r\nprofit in studying rocks, will come from the understanding which they\r\nwill give as to the history of that particular part of the earth’s crust\r\nwhere they are found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Igneous Rocks\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks are those which have formed from material that has been\r\nmelted, which involves temperatures around 1300° C.; or, if there is\r\nwater in the original material, temperatures as low as 800° C. will\r\nsuffice. Considering the increase of temperature to be a degree for\r\nevery 50 feet downward, this involves the rocks having been at depths of\r\n5 to 10 miles below the surface. While at such depths the temperature\r\nmust be high enough to melt rocks, the great pressure of the overlying\r\nrocks seems to keep them solid; for we know that the center of the earth\r\nis solid, as is shown by a variety of observations, such as the rate at\r\nwhich earthquake waves are transmitted through the earth, the lack of\r\ntidal effects, etc. However, there is every reason to believe that if\r\nthe pressure is removed from the rocks which are five to ten miles below\r\nthe surface, there is heat enough at those depths to melt them. When the\r\ncrust of the earth is folded, as when mountain ranges are formed, the\r\nareas under the arches or upward folds are relieved of pressure. Then\r\nthose rocks, which are under the arches and are relieved, become molten.\r\nThe molten magma may well up and fill the space beneath the arch where\r\nit would cool again very slowly; or, if there is fissuring during the\r\nfolding, some of the molten material may be forced out through the\r\nfissures and pour out over the surface as lava. Another area in which\r\npressures may be locally relieved is in the region of faulting, where\r\nthe crust of the earth is broken into blocks, between which there are\r\nreadjustments, some being tipped one way, some another, some uplifted.\r\nHere again there would be areas of relieved pressure and molten magmas\r\nwould form, some of them solidifying in place, others rising to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe molten material is termed the magma, and when it reaches the\r\nsurface, great quantities of water vapor and other gases escape: or\r\nthese gases may even escape from magmas which do not reach the surface,\r\nrising through fissures. As these hot vapors pass through the fissures,\r\nthey are cooled, and may deposit part or all of their dissolved\r\ncompounds in the fissure, making veins. Lava is the magma minus the\r\nvapors. Magmas vary greatly from place to place, indicating that they\r\nare formed locally and do not come from any general interior reservoir,\r\nas has sometimes been suggested.\r\n\r\nWhen the molten magmas escape to the surface, they are termed extrusive,\r\nand as they spread out in a layer this is termed a sheet. This rise and\r\noverflow may be quiet, and from time to time one outpouring may follow\r\nanother making sheet after sheet. Or after one outpouring, the pressure\r\nbelow may cease for a time and allow the lava to solidify and make a cap\r\nor cover over the opening. Before more lava can rise, this cover must be\r\nremoved. This usually happens in an explosive manner, the lava below,\r\nwith the increasing pressure exerted by its expanding gases, finally\r\nexerting enough pressure, so that the cover is broken, or shattered and\r\nthrown in thousands of fragments into the air, as happened at Mt. Pelée\r\non the Island of Martinique in 1902. The fragments thrown into the air\r\nare often termed volcanic ashes, though this is not a good word for\r\nthem, for they have not been burned.\r\n\r\nIn case the molten magmas under the relieved areas do not reach the\r\nsurface they are termed intrusive. Such magmas may remain in the space\r\nunder a mountain fold, or be forced in fissures part way to the surface.\r\nWhen the magma is forced into more or less vertical cracks and there\r\nsolidifies, and these are exposed by erosion, they are termed dikes.\r\nSometimes the magmas have risen part way to the surface and then pushed\r\ntheir way between two horizontal layers of rock and there hardened, in\r\nwhich case they are termed sills, when uncovered. The Palisades along\r\nthe Hudson River are the exposed edge of a sill. Again the molten magmas\r\nmay well up and spread between two horizontal layers, but come faster\r\nthan they can spread horizontally, and then the magma takes the form of\r\na half sphere, and the overlying layers of rock are domed up over it.\r\nSuch a mass is termed a laccolith. In all these cases the mass of\r\nigneous rock is only discovered when the overlying rocks have been\r\neroded off. The great mass of molten magma under the arches of mountain\r\nranges simply cools slowly into a granitic type of rock. These masses\r\nare exposed when the thousands of feet of overlying rock are eroded off.\r\nWhen these masses are exposed, if of but a few miles in extent, they are\r\ncalled stocks, but, if of many miles in length and breadth, they are\r\nbatholiths, and are very characteristic of the heart of mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nIn all the above cases the exterior of the molten mass cools first, and\r\nforms a shell around the rest. The shell determines the size of the\r\nmass. As the cooling continues into the interior, it also solidifies,\r\nand as all rocks shrink on cooling, cracks develop, separating the mass\r\ninto smaller pieces. There is usually no regularity about these cracks\r\nand the mass is divided into blocks from six inches to three feet in\r\ndiameter. However, in some cases, especially in sills and laccoliths\r\nwhere the cooling is slower, the shrinkage may be marked by a regular\r\nsystem of cracks which bound the rock into more or less regular\r\nhexagonal columns. The Palisades and the Devil’s Tower in Wyoming (See\r\nPlate 52) show this structure. The Devil’s Tower is the remnant of a\r\nlaccolith, all except the central core of which has been eroded away.\r\nAll of the above terms have nothing to do with composition, but refer\r\nentirely to the manner of occurrence.\r\n\r\nWhile the igneous rocks are classified according to their composition,\r\nthe rate at which they cooled has much to do with their texture, and\r\ncertain names apply to the texture. For instance when the molten lava\r\ncools very rapidly, there is no time for the formation of crystals, and\r\nthe resulting rock is glassy or non-crystalline. If the cooling is slow\r\nas in large bodies, crystals have time to form and grow to considerable\r\nsize as in granites. Between these all grades may occur; and one\r\nclassification of igneous rocks expresses their rate of cooling, in such\r\nterms as the following.\r\n\r\nGlassy—lavas which have cooled so quickly that they are without distinct\r\ncrystallization, such as obsidian, pitchstone, etc.\r\n\r\nDense or felsitic—lavas which have cooled less rapidly, so that crystals\r\nhave formed, but in which the crystals are too small to be identified by\r\nthe unaided eye, such as felsite or basalt.\r\n\r\nPorphyritic—magmas from which, in solidifying, one mineral has\r\ncrystallized out first and the crystals have grown to considerable size,\r\nwhile the rest have remained small.\r\n\r\nGranitoid—magmas which have solidified slowly, so that all the minerals\r\nhave crystallized completely, and the component crystals are large\r\nenough to be recognized readily, as in granite.\r\n\r\nFragmental—a term applied to the fragments which have resulted from\r\nexplosive eruptions of igneous rocks. These fragments may be loose or\r\nconsolidated. Volcanic ashes are typical.\r\n\r\nPorous—a term applied to the lava near the upper surface, which is\r\nfilled with gas cavities, such as pumice.\r\n\r\nAmygdoloidal—is the term applied to porous lavas, when the cavities have\r\nbeen filled by other minerals, such as calcite or some of the zeolites.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining a rock, first decide whether it is igneous, sedimentary\r\nor metamorphic. The igneous character is recognized by its being either\r\nglassy, or composed of masses of crystals irregularly arranged, there\r\nbeing neither layering nor bedding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CLASSIFICATION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\n   Texture                         Excess of light colored minerals                                   Excess of dark colored minerals\r\n\r\n Glassy       obsidian, perlite, pumice, pitchstone                                       scorias, trachylyte, basalt-obsidian\r\n\r\n                      Feldspar orthoclase                                Feldspar Plagioclase                                 No feldspar\r\n              Mica and/or hornblende and/or augite         Mica and/or hornblende               with pyroxene          augite and/or hornblende\r\n                                                                                                                              and/or mica\r\n                   +quartz            -quartz           +quartz            -quartz           +olivine      -olivine   +olivine       -olivine\r\n\r\n Dense        rhyolite           trachite           dacite (felsite)  andesite (felsite)  basalt                                 augitite or\r\n                                                                                                                                 hornblendite\r\n Porphyritic  rhyolite-porphyry  trachite-porphyry  dacite-porphyry   andesite-porphyry   basalt-porphyry                        augitite-porphyry\r\n Granitoid    granite            syenite            quartz-diorite    diorite             olivine-gabbro   gabbro    peridotite  pyroxenite\r\n Fragmental   rhyolite, tuff     trachite, tuff     Dacite, tuff or   andesite tuff or    Basalt tuffs and breccias\r\n              or breccia         or breccia         breccia           breccia\r\n\r\nWhen it is located as igneous, turn to the key on page 177 and decide as\r\nto which type of texture is present. If glassy, the color, luster and\r\ntype of construction will place it. If the rock is crystalline, first\r\ndecide whether feldspar is present, and if present, what type: then\r\ndetermine the dark mineral, and lastly whether quartz or olivine is\r\npresent. In dense rocks the presence of quartz may be determined by\r\ntrying the hardness, for none of the other constituents of igneous rocks\r\nhave so great hardness. For example, if it is found that a rock is\r\ncomposed of orthoclase hornblende and quartz, and the texture is\r\ngranitoid, it is granite: or if the rock is plagioclase feldspar and\r\npyroxene of any sort, it is gabbro, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nGranite\r\nPl. 53\r\n\r\nThe combination of orthoclase feldspar (or microcline), quartz, and\r\neither mica, hornblende or augite is termed granite, if the texture is\r\ncoarse enough so the individual minerals can be recognized with the\r\nunaided eye. The rock is light-colored because the feldspar and quartz\r\ndominate. Accessory minerals may be present such as apatite, zircon,\r\nberyl or magnetite. Varieties of granite are distinguished according to\r\nthe dark mineral present. When this is muscovite, it is a\r\n_muscovite-granite_; when it is biotite, a _biotite-granite_; if it is\r\nhornblende, a _hornblende-granite_; etc. The size of crystals in granite\r\nvaries widely. When they are as small as ¹/₁₂ of an inch in diameter, it\r\nis termed fine grained; from ¹/₁₂ to ¼ of an inch, it is medium-grained;\r\nwhen larger, it is coarse-grained. In some cases the crystals may be\r\nover a foot in diameter which is known as _giant granite_.\r\n\r\nOriginally granite was a great mass of molten magma, which has cooled\r\nvery slowly, having been intruded or thrust up in great stocks or\r\nbatholiths beneath overlying rocks, which acted as a blanket to prevent\r\nrapid cooling. These overlying rocks, in their turn, have been acted\r\nupon by the heat and metamorphosed. Granite is particularly likely to\r\nhave been formed under mountain folds; so that, after the mountains have\r\nbeen more or less completely eroded away, the great masses of granite\r\nhave come to the surface to mark the axes of the ranges; and even after\r\nthe mountains have been wholly worn away, the granite remains to mark\r\nthe sites on which they stood.\r\n\r\nIn the granite mass itself, there are often veins and dikes, which\r\nprobably resulted from the shrinkage of the cooling granite, and they\r\nare filled with a different and usually coarser granite known as\r\npegmatite. This pegmatite formed from the residual magmatic material, so\r\nthat as some of the elements had already crystallized out, the granite\r\nin these dikes is of different composition. The extreme coarseness of\r\nthese pegmatites seems to be due to the character of the mineralizing\r\nagents left in the dikes. In some of these pegmatites the feldspar and\r\nquartz are so intergrown, that when broken along the cleavage surface of\r\nthe feldspar, the quartz appears like cuneiform characters, and this\r\nvariety has been given the name _graphic granite_ (See Plate 53).\r\n\r\nWhen granite is exposed to weathering, the feldspar is the first mineral\r\nto be decomposed, altering eventually into carbonates, quartz and\r\nkaolin. The dark minerals are only slightly less susceptible and they\r\nbreak down into carbonates, iron oxides and kaolin. The original quartz\r\nremains unchanged. Of these products the carbonates, some of the iron\r\noxide and a little of the quartz are carried away in solution. The\r\nkaolin and some of the iron oxide is in fine particles and they are\r\ncarried by the water until it comes to the lakes or the sea. The quartz\r\nis left in coarser grains, which are more slowly transported, and\r\ndeposited in coarser or finer sand and gravel beds.\r\n\r\nGranites are widely used for building stone, because they can be worked\r\nreadily in all directions, and have great strength and beauty. The color\r\ndepends largely on the color of the feldspar, which may be white or\r\npink, in which case the granite will be gray to pink.\r\n\r\nGranites occur throughout New England, the Piedmont Plateau, the Lake\r\nSuperior Region, the Black Hills, Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyenite\r\nPl. 54\r\n\r\nThe combination of orthoclase and either mica, hornblende, or augite is\r\nsyenite, the texture being coarse enough so that the individual minerals\r\ncan be distinguished by the unaided eye. It differs from granite in the\r\nabsence of quartz. Syenite is a light-colored rock with the feldspar\r\npredominating. Minerals like apatite, zircon, or magnetite may occur in\r\nit, as accessory minerals. The foregoing would be an ideal syenite, but\r\nusually there is some plagioclase feldspar also present. If this occurs\r\nin such quantities as to nearly equal the orthoclase feldspar, the rock\r\nis termed a _monzonite_; if it predominates, the rock becomes a diorite.\r\nThe presence of quartz would make this rock into a granite. Such a\r\ncompound rock has its type form, and when the proportions of the\r\ncomponent minerals are changed, it grades into other types.\r\n\r\nLike the granite, syenite is an intrusive rock, which occurs in stocks\r\nand batholiths along the axes of present or past mountain ranges. The\r\noriginal magma welled up under the mountain folds, where it cooled\r\nslowly, metamorphosing the adjacent rocks. Like granite it has only been\r\nexposed after a long period of erosion has removed the overlying layers\r\nof rock.\r\n\r\nSyenites are not as abundant as granites, but they occur in the White\r\nMountains, near Little Rock, Ark., in Custer Co., Colo., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuartz-Diorite\r\n\r\nThe combination of plagioclase feldspar, quartz and either mica or\r\nhornblende makes quartz-diorite, sometimes called _tonalite_. The above\r\nwould be the typical quartz-diorite, but there is usually some\r\northoclase present, which if it equals the plagioclase feldspar in\r\namount makes this into a monzonite; or if it dominates, it makes the\r\nrock a granite. Quartz-diorite is darker colored than the two preceding\r\nrocks, the dark minerals being about as abundant as the light-colored\r\nones, such as feldspar and quartz. For this reason the weight is also\r\nsomewhat greater.\r\n\r\nLike the others this is an intrusive rock, occurring in stocks and\r\nbatholiths, and indicative of great molten masses thrust up under\r\nmountain folds, and only exposed after the overlying rocks have been\r\nweathered away. It is by no means an abundant type of rock, but occurs\r\nat Belchertown, Mass., Peekskill, N. Y., in the Yellowstone Park, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiorite\r\n\r\nPlagioclase feldspar with hornblende or mica, or with both, is known as\r\ndiorite. It is distinguished from quartz-diorite by the absence of\r\nquartz. There is generally some augite in it, but if this should be\r\nequal to, or exceed the hornblende, the rock is then a gabbro. There may\r\nalso be a small amount of orthoclase present, without taking this rock\r\nout of the diorite class, but if the orthoclase feldspar becomes\r\ndominant, then the rock is a syenite. Thus there is gradation into other\r\ngroups in all directions. Apatite, magnetite, zircon, and titanite often\r\noccur in small quantities as accessory minerals. Generally the\r\nhornblende is in excess of the feldspar, so that the rock is a\r\ndark-colored one.\r\n\r\nDiorites occur in much the same manner as granites, being in stocks,\r\nbatholiths or dikes, and are often associated with granites and gabbros.\r\nThey are great intruded masses, associated with mountain making, and\r\nlike the preceding rocks, cooled far below the surface, and have been\r\nexposed only after great thicknesses of overlying rocks have been\r\nweathered away.\r\n\r\nPeekskill, N. Y., the Sudbury nickel district in Canada, Mt. Davidson\r\nabove the Comstock Lode in Nevada, etc., are typical localities for\r\nfinding diorite.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlivine-Gabbro\r\n\r\nThe combination of plagioclase feldspar with augite (or any of the\r\npyroxenes) and olivine makes olivine-gabbro. The feldspar is usually one\r\nof those with considerable calcium in it, like labradorite; and as the\r\ndark minerals predominate, the rock is dark-colored. It is an intrusive\r\nrock, usually in dikes or stocks, where it solidified far below the\r\nsurface, and was only exposed after the overlying rocks were weathered\r\noff. It is by no means an abundant type of rock, but is found in the\r\nLake Superior Region, and near Birch Lake, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\nGabbro\r\nPl. 54\r\n\r\nPlagioclase feldspar with any one of the pyroxenes, most commonly\r\naugite, is gabbro. There is a wide range in the relative proportions of\r\nthe two minerals making gabbro. At one extreme are rocks made entirely,\r\nor almost entirely, of plagioclase feldspar, which are known as\r\nanorthosites, and occur in parts of the higher mountains of the\r\nAdirondacks like Mt. Marcy, in several places in eastern Canada, etc.\r\nThen there are the typical gabbros where the feldspar and augite are\r\nmore or less equally represented. At the other extreme come those\r\ngabbros in which the pyroxene predominates, in the most marked cases the\r\nfeldspar being entirely lacking, and the rock being termed a pyroxenite.\r\nWhen the pyroxene of a gabbro is either enstatite or hyposthene (usually\r\nthe latter) the gabbro is often called norite. Magnetite, biotite, and\r\nhornblende may occur in small quantities as accessory minerals.\r\n\r\nGabbro is a common intrusive rock, occurring in stocks, batholiths, and\r\ndikes, and often varies considerably in different parts of the mass.\r\nLike granite the mass solidified far below the surface, under some\r\nmountain fold, and has only been exposed as the result of weathering\r\naway the layers of overlying rock. Gabbros appear much like diorites,\r\nbut are distinguished by the fact that the dark mineral is one of the\r\npyroxenes, instead of an amphibole or a mica. They are widely\r\ndistributed, being found in the White Mountains, near Peekskill, N. Y.,\r\nBaltimore, Md., about Lake Superior, in Wyoming, the Rocky Mts., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeridotite\r\n\r\nA rock made up of olivine and augite (or any of the pyroxenes) is\r\nperidotite. As it contains no feldspar, and both augite and olivine are\r\ndark-green to black in color, these rocks are always dark green to black\r\nin color and of considerable weight. They are usually rather coarsely\r\ncrystalline. Peridotite is usually associated with gabbro, making dikes\r\nwhich lead from the main gabbro mass. Less frequently it occurs\r\nindependently, making up an intrusive mass. Hornblende and mica may be\r\npresent in small quantities, as accessory minerals.\r\n\r\nIn general these are rather rare rocks, making dikes connected with\r\nstocks or batholiths of gabbro. Peridotite is found near Baltimore, Md.,\r\nin Custer Co., Colo., in Kentucky, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyroxenite\r\n\r\nThis represents the extreme among coarsely crystalline igneous rocks, a\r\nwhole mass made up of one mineral, and that some one of the pyroxene\r\ngroup. If the mineral can be exactly determined, the rock may be still\r\nmore definitely named. For instance if it is all augite, then the rock\r\nwould be called augitite. Like the preceding rocks, pyroxenite is an\r\nintrusive rock, usually found in dikes, which are connected with gabbro,\r\nand it represents the segregation of one mineral out of the gabbro, and\r\nits solidification at one point. Hornblende, magnetite and pyrrhotite\r\nmay be present as accessory minerals. This is not a common rock, but it\r\nillustrates the fact that all possible combinations do occur, if the\r\ncircumstances have warranted it. It is found near Baltimore, Md.,\r\nWebster, N. C., and in Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\nRhyolite\r\n\r\nThis is a combination of orthoclase feldspar, quartz, and either\r\nhornblende, mica or augite in which the crystals are of such small size\r\nthat they can not be identified with the naked eye. In composition it\r\ncorresponds to granite, but it is much finer in texture. It differs from\r\ntrachite by having quartz while the latter has none. This can usually be\r\ndetermined by trying the hardness as none of the other minerals are as\r\nhard as 7. It is much harder to distinguish it from dacite which differs\r\nonly in having plagioclase feldspar in place of the orthoclase, and only\r\nthe microscope will enable one to make this distinction. Where the\r\ndistinction cannot be made these light-colored lavas are often called\r\nfelsite.\r\n\r\nRhyolite is usually an extrusive lava, occurring in sheets, but\r\nsometimes it is intrusive, occurring in sills, dikes, and laccoliths. In\r\nall these cases the lava has solidified so rapidly, that the crystals\r\nare tiny, and only the general effect of a crystalline structure is\r\ndistinguishable. Rhyolites may occur with porphyritic structure, in\r\nwhich case the presence of the larger feldspar crystals will help to\r\ndistinguish whether they are orthoclase or not, making the determination\r\neasier. The color of rhyolites is green, red or gray, always a decided\r\nlight shade.\r\n\r\nRhyolites are abundant in the western states, as in the Black Hills, the\r\nYellowstone Park, Colorado, Nevada, California, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrachite\r\n\r\nThe combination of orthoclase feldspar with mica, hornblende or augite\r\nis termed trachite, if the texture is dense. It is usually an extrusive\r\nlava of light color (green, red or gray), and corresponds in composition\r\nto syenite. It can be distinguished from rhyolite by having no quartz,\r\nand so nothing to show a hardness above 5.5; but it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish it from andesite, which differs only in having plagioclase\r\nfeldspar in place of orthoclase. It sometimes occurs with a porphyritic\r\nstructure, in which case the feldspar crystals are usually large enough\r\nto be distinguished.\r\n\r\nTrachites are not abundant in America, but some are found in the Black\r\nHills of South Dakota, in Custer Co., Colo., and in Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\nDacite\r\n\r\nThe union of plagioclase feldspar, quartz, and either hornblende or mica\r\nis termed dacite, if the texture is dense. It is an extrusive lava,\r\noccurring mostly in sheets and dikes. It corresponds in composition to\r\nquartz-diorite. As the texture is dense it is difficult to distinguish\r\ndacite from rhyolite, for both have quartz and differ only in the\r\ncharacter of the feldspar, so it is quite common to use the term felsite\r\nwhich does not distinguish between the two, and only states that the\r\nrock is dense, light-colored and extrusive. When, as often occurs, the\r\ntexture is porphyritic, and the feldspars are the large crystals, then\r\nexact determination is fairly easy.\r\n\r\nDacites are rather common, occurring on McClelland Peak, Nev., in the\r\nEureka district, Nev., on Lassen’s Peak, Calif., Sepulchre Mt. in the\r\nYellowstone Park, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndesite\r\n\r\nThe union of plagioclase feldspar with mica, hornblende or augite, makes\r\nandesite if the texture is dense. The lack of quartz, and so no mineral\r\nwhich has a hardness of over 5.5, makes it possible to distinguish\r\nandesite from dacite or rhyolite, but it is hard to distinguish this\r\nrock from trachite, which differs only on having orthoclase feldspar in\r\nplace of plagioclase. When the texture is porphyritic and the feldspars\r\nare the large crystals, then it is easy to make the distinction.\r\nAndesite gets its name from being the characteristic lava of the Andes\r\nMountains, and is the commonest of all the extruded, light-colored\r\nlavas, being the lava of hundreds of flows throughout the western United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe union of plagioclase feldspar and biotite is the commonest type.\r\nPlagioclase with hornblende or augite is less common, and, when they do\r\noccur, they are usually distinguished as _hornblende-andesite_ or\r\n_augite-andesite_. Magnetite, apatite and zircon may be present as\r\naccessory minerals.\r\n\r\nThe lavas of Mt. Hood, Shasta, Rainier and others of the volcanic peaks\r\nof the Cascade Range, those at Eureka and Comstock in Nevada, in the\r\nYellowstone National Park, and the porphyries of many peaks in Colorado,\r\nlike the Henry Mts., etc., which are exposed laccolithic intrusions, are\r\nall andesites, as are many more.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasalt\r\n\r\nThe combination of plagioclase feldspar with olivine and augite (or any\r\nother pyroxene) makes a heavy, dark-colored, black to dark-brown rock\r\nwhich, if its texture is dense or porphyritic, is termed basalt. This\r\nusually has more or less magnetite in it as an accessory mineral, indeed\r\nthe magnetite may be so abundant as to be a component part of the rock.\r\nThis magnetite makes trouble for anyone trying to use a compass on or\r\nabout basalt rocks. These are extrusive or intrusive rocks and\r\ncorrespond in composition to gabbro.\r\n\r\nBasalts are among the commonest of igneous rocks, and are popularly\r\ndesignated “_trap_,” much used as a road ballast on account of its\r\ntoughness, which is largely due to its dense texture. The coast of New\r\nEngland is seamed with dikes of basalt, and through the Adirondack and\r\nWhite Mountains there are a host of these dikes. The crests of such\r\nmountains, as the Holyoke Range, the Tom Range, the Talcott Mts., East\r\nand West Rocks at New Haven, etc., are all basalt sheets. The Palisades,\r\nFirst Wachung and Second Wachung Mountains of New Jersey are sills of\r\nbasalt. The Lake Superior region is crisscrossed with basalt dikes. That\r\ngreatest of all lava fields the Columbia Plateau, covering over 200,000\r\nsquare miles on the Snake and Columbia Rivers in Oregon, Washington and\r\nIdaho, is all basalt. So it goes all down through Nevada, New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPorphyry\r\nPl. 55\r\n\r\nThis is a term which properly refers to texture alone, indicating a\r\nlava, which has cooled in such a manner that one mineral has\r\ncrystallized out of the magma first and developed to a larger size,\r\nwhile the mass of the material formed tiny crystals in which the larger\r\nones are embedded. The large crystals are technically known as\r\n_phenocrysts_. The surrounding mass of tiny crystals is termed the\r\n_matrix_. This porphyritic structure is especially characteristic of\r\nlavas which have been extruded in large masses, and of intruded lavas in\r\nsuch places as sills and laccoliths.\r\n\r\nThe term porphyry today has the above precise meaning. It is a much\r\nabused word, and has had all sorts of meanings. In the past it was first\r\nused to refer to lavas in general, then it came to be applied to lavas\r\nwhich had been erupted before Tertiary times, that is to all ancient\r\nlava sheets. This idea soon proved incorrect, lavas being of the same\r\ncomposition whether ancient or recent. In the West the word is often\r\ncolloquially used today to designate almost every kind of igneous rock\r\noccurring in sheets or dikes, if in any way connected with ore deposits.\r\n\r\nWhen the composition of a rock with porphyritic textures can be\r\ndetermined, the name due to the composition is coupled with that due to\r\ntexture, making such terms as _trachite-porphyry_, _basalt-porphyry_,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuff\r\n\r\nTuff, a term not to be confused with tufa on page 215, is the name used\r\nto designate the finer fragmental ejecta of volcanic eruptions, which\r\nare also often referred to as “volcanic ash,” but the word, ash, conveys\r\nthe false impression that the rock is a remnant of something burned, and\r\nis therefore not a good term. When first ejected, tuff is loose\r\nmaterial, but it is usually soon cemented to make a more or less firm\r\nmass of rock, for which the term, tuff, is still retained. In some\r\ncases, while still loose, it is carried by streams to a distance and\r\ndeposited in more or less sorted and layered beds: and the finer tuff is\r\noften carried by the winds and laid down, at a considerable distance\r\nfrom its source, in so called “ash beds.” In both these cases,\r\nsedimentary characteristics have been added to the tuff, and layering\r\nwhich is characteristic of sedimentary deposits, is present. These\r\ntransported tuff beds are really sedimentary, but as there is little\r\nchange in the material, they are referred to here and not again. These\r\ntuff beds are not at all uncommon in the sedimentary deposits of\r\nTertiary age in the Rocky Mountain region. The coarser material of\r\nvolcanic eruptions usually goes under the head of breccia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreccia\r\n\r\nThis term is used to describe the coarse fragmental ejecta of volcanic\r\neruptions. It is also used, in the section under sedimentary rocks, in a\r\nbroad sense to include all angular unworn fragmental material, whether\r\nof igneous or sedimentary origin. For this reason, when dealing with\r\nigneous rocks, it is usual to designate the fragments according to their\r\ncomposition, making such terms as _trachite-breccia_,\r\n_rhyolite-breccia_, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile still loose (and also even when cemented into beds of rock), it is\r\ncustomary to designate the smaller fragments, from the size of a grain\r\nof wheat up to an inch or two in diameter, as _lapilli_; the larger\r\nfragments, from two inches up to a foot or so in diameter, as _bombs_;\r\nand the largest masses, often tons in weight, as _volcanic blocks_.\r\n\r\n\r\nObsidian\r\nPl. 55\r\n\r\nLavas, which have cooled so quickly that crystals have not had time to\r\nform, have a glassy appearance, and are termed obsidian. If the color is\r\ndark, due to the presence of large amounts of those elements which make\r\ndark minerals, this lava is termed _basalt-obsidian_. Obsidian is\r\ncharacterized by its glassy texture, a hardness around 6, and by\r\nbreaking with a conchoidal fracture, so called because the surface is\r\nmarked by a series of concentric ridges, something like the lines of\r\ngrowth on a shell. Obsidians vary greatly in color, but are usually red\r\nor green to black, and translucent on thin edges. While glassy, all the\r\nobsidians contain embryonic crystals, which appear like dust particles\r\nfloating in the glassy matrix, or there may even be a few larger\r\ncrystals present, which are often arranged in flow lines. Most all large\r\nmasses of obsidian have streaks or layers of stony material in them\r\nwhere crystallization has set in, in a limited way.\r\n\r\nNear the upper surface, obsidians usually have gas cavities scattered\r\nthrough them, and these may be small and few, or large and numerous.\r\nIndeed the cavities may be so numerous as to dominate and give the rock\r\na frothy appearance. In this case, if the cavities are small and more or\r\nless uniform, the rock is called _pumice_; if they are larger it is\r\n_scoria_. If, as often happens when the lava is ancient and has been\r\nburied beneath other rocks, the cavities have been filled with some\r\nsecondary mineral, then the lava is called an _amygdoloid_.\r\n\r\nObsidian is found in many localities, especially where there are recent\r\nvolcanoes, the most famous places being the obsidian cliffs in the\r\nYellowstone Park, those near Mono Lake in California, and many other\r\nlocalities in the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevadas, and the Cascade\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nPitchstone\r\n\r\nThis is very like obsidian in appearance, but differs in that the glassy\r\nmaterial contains from five to ten per cent of water in its composition,\r\nthe most obvious effect of which is to make the luster resinous, instead\r\nof vitreous, as is characteristic of obsidian. The colors are commonly\r\nred, green or brown. Pitchstone is associated with recent volcanoes, and\r\nsome fine specimens have come from Silver Cliffs, Colo., and various\r\nparts of New Mexico and Nevada.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerlite\r\n_pearlstone_\r\n\r\nPerlite is a glassy lava, containing two to four per cent of water,\r\nwhich, on cooling, has cracked into numerous rounded masses, with a\r\nconcentric structure, reminding one of the layers of an onion.\r\n\r\n\r\nScoria\r\n\r\nWhile lava is cooling, there is a constant escape of gases, mostly\r\nsteam, and as these rise through the molten mass they make cavities,\r\nnear the upper surface, that portion on top often becoming frothy. If\r\nthis solidifies quickly so that the gas cavities are preserved it is\r\nscoria. When the gas cavities are small and uniformly distributed, the\r\nrock is called pumice, and often used as a scouring agent. When the\r\ncavities are large and irregular the term scoria is generally used.\r\nMolten lavas may form various structures, according to the conditions\r\nunder which they cool, dripping through cracks or from the roof of\r\ncaves, which often form where the molten lava escapes from a hardened\r\nshell, and making stalactites, stalagmites, etc. The very thin lava of\r\nthe Hawaiian volcanoes may even be blown by the wind into fine threads,\r\nknown as “Pele’s hair.”\r\n\r\nThe presence of the gas cavities is so characteristic of the upper\r\nsurface of lavas which have been extruded; that, where one is dealing\r\nwith older lavas, now buried beneath other rocks, this fact helps to\r\ndetermine whether the mass is a sheet, rather than a sill; for, in the\r\ncase of the sill, the lava was forced between layers of sedimentary\r\nrocks, and the burden of the overlying rocks did not permit the escape\r\nof steam and therefore the upper surface of sills does not have the\r\nscoriaceous structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmygdoloid\r\nPl. 56\r\n\r\nWhen the upper surface of a lava is filled with steam holes, and this\r\nlava has been buried beneath other rocks, the seeping waters slowly\r\nbring such minerals as quartz, calcite and zeolites and fill the\r\ncavities. Such a rock is known as an amygdoloid. It is often confused\r\nwith porphyry; but, if examined closely, it will be seen that the\r\noutlines of the gas cavities are rounded, while the outlines of a\r\ncrystal, like a phenocryst, are always angular. This will be clear if\r\nthe amygdoloid on Plate 56 is compared with the porphyry on Plate 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Sedimentary Rocks\r\n\r\nTo this class belong all those rocks which have been laid down by water\r\nor wind, or are the results of organic depositions. They include loose\r\nmaterial like sand or day, and also the same materials, when cemented\r\ninto more or less solid rocks, like sandstone or shale. So long as the\r\nmaterial has not been altered from what it was when laid down, the rock\r\nis termed sedimentary.\r\n\r\nIn general the material of which these rocks are composed comes from the\r\nweathering and disintegration of other rocks. This does not apply to the\r\norganic deposits, for each type of which there is a peculiar mode of\r\nformation. To illustrate the typical formation of sedimentary rocks, we\r\nmay look at the fate of a granite when exposed. At once the surface is\r\nattacked by changes of temperature, frost and rain. The various minerals\r\nof the granite expand and contract with every change of temperature, but\r\neach component mineral has a different coefficient of expansion under\r\nheat, so that minute cracks are quickly formed between the minerals.\r\nWater gets into these cracks and begins to dissolve the minerals.\r\nFeldspar is the most easily attacked, part of it being dissolved and\r\ncarried away, a small part changing to quartz, and by far the largest\r\npart changing to kaolin. The dark mineral is also attacked and partly\r\ndissolved, and partly changed to kaolin and iron oxides. The quartz\r\nresists solution almost completely. Of these products the kaolin and\r\niron oxides are carried far away and deposited in still water. The\r\nquartz and perhaps some of the dark mineral are heavier and carried more\r\nslowly, being deposited as sand. This happens to granite everywhere, but\r\nin the regions where there is frost the action is greatly hastened; for\r\nwater gets into the cracks and expands every time it freezes and thus\r\nwidens the cracks rapidly, which greatly facilitates the entrance and\r\nmovement of water in the rock. In a similar way any original rock will\r\nbe disintegrated, and the residue, after the soluble part has been\r\ncarried away, becomes sand or clay or mud.\r\n\r\nParticles of quartz, kaolin, and lime, separately, or mixed, loose or\r\nmore or less cemented, with accompanying impurities, make up the great\r\nbulk of the sedimentary rocks. They are usually arranged in layers, of\r\nvarying thickness, as they were laid down by water or the wind. In the\r\nsame way layered accumulations which are either products of plants or\r\nanimals, or parts of the plants or animals, are considered sedimentary,\r\nas for instance, coal, chalk, petroleum, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 A Classification of Sedimentary Rocks\r\n\r\n  Inorganic origin:\r\n    1.

Phosphates from animals              guano, phosphate rock, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTalus\r\n\r\nWhere weathering is very active, especially on or below steep mountain\r\nslopes, a mass of loose, angular fragments accumulates. This material is\r\ntermed talus, a term which refers only to the physical character of the\r\nmaterial, and not at all to its composition. If weathering continues\r\nthese fragments will be further broken up into one of the finer grained\r\nrocks, which the water can carry away and deposit elsewhere. There is\r\nlittle or no layering in talus. If the talus is not carried away but is\r\ncemented where it was formed, the resulting mass is termed breccia, but\r\nthis is not very commonly the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreccia\r\nPl. 58\r\n\r\nThe term breccia is used to cover all those rocks which are composed of\r\nangular fragments, of any composition, and above sand in size, when they\r\nare cemented into a solid mass, by any sort of cementing agent. Here the\r\nterm is used in its broad sense, as compared with the way it was used\r\nunder igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nBreccias may result from the cementing of talus, but more often the\r\nbreaking up of the material into angular fragments was due to other\r\ncauses, such as crushing along a fault plane, or in the movements\r\ninvolved in mountain making. In such cases the breccia is of limited\r\nextent, but may occur repeatedly in the same neighborhood. Limestone,\r\nwhich has been crushed and then recemented, often makes a rock which\r\ntakes a good polish and is used in several localities as an ornamental\r\nstone in place of marble, in fact often goes in trade circles under the\r\nname of “marble.” The breccia figured on Plate 58 is such a limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil\r\n\r\nOver most of the earth’s surface there is a covering of rock waste, the\r\nproduct of weathering, some of which is unassorted, and some of it\r\nsorted by water or wind. This is all termed soil. It is an ever-moving\r\ncover resulting from the decomposition of the underlying rocks, to which\r\nhave been added in places layers of rock waste brought from afar by the\r\nstreams. Some soils are rock waste which had been carried clear to the\r\nocean and deposited on the floor of the sea, and is now above sea level,\r\nbecause the floor of the sea has been elevated. Inasmuch as the\r\nunderlying rocks vary in composition, and as there are areas of\r\ntransported material, it is clear that the composition of soils must\r\nvary from place to place, both as to composition and texture.\r\n\r\nSoils range from the finest, composed mostly of clay, to coarse ones,\r\ncomposed of sand, gravel or even boulders. Clay, the finest grained\r\nsoil, is composed of particles only about ¹/₁₀₀₀th of a millimeter in\r\ndiameter, of which it would take 720,000 billion particles to make a\r\ngram’s weight. Ordinary soils however have about 2 to 5 million\r\nparticles to the gram.\r\n\r\nThe average specific gravity of soil with the usual amount of humus in\r\nit is from 2.55 to 2.75. In this case however the specific gravity is of\r\nless importance than is the volume weight. A cubic foot of water weighs\r\n62½ pounds, that of soil from 75 to 80 pounds, the extremes being 30 lb.\r\nfor peaty soil and 110 lb. for calcareous sand. The terms “heavy” and\r\n“light,” used in agriculture do not refer to the volume weight, for clay\r\nwhich is actually relatively light (70-75 lb. per cubic foot) is classed\r\nas a “heavy” soil; while sand, of much greater actual weight, is classed\r\nas a “light” soil. These terms as used in agriculture refer to the ease\r\nwith which the soils are worked, and to their penetrability by plant\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nSoil is usually divided into an upper darker-colored layer, termed loam,\r\nand into a lower, lighter-colored layer, termed subsoil. The presence of\r\nhumus, resulting from the decomposition of plant and animal remains is\r\nthe factor which darkens the color and distinguishes the loam; so that\r\nloam is a complex of inorganic rock particles plus more or less humus,\r\ncolloid compounds, bacteria, living plants and animals. The subsoil is\r\nmainly rock particles. The distinctions between these two layers break\r\ndown in arid soils, and often also in swampy regions.\r\n\r\nIt is this layer of soil on which the water of every rain and flood\r\nworks, picking part of it up and carrying it along, step by step, to the\r\nsea. Though the amount moved on any one day is small, the sum of all the\r\nsoil transported is enormous, a large river carrying annual incredible\r\namounts. For instance the Mississippi annually deposits in the Gulf of\r\nMexico 476,900,000 metric tons (2204 lb. to the metric ton), of which\r\nabout a third is in solution. At this rate it takes about 7000 to 9000\r\nyears to remove a foot from over the whole drainage basin. This is\r\nconsiderably slower than is the case of some other rivers. While on the\r\none hand soil is being continuously carried away from the surface, on\r\nthe other hand it is being constantly renewed from below, by the\r\nweathering action of water, air and temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nGravel\r\n\r\nGravel is a mass of loose fragments of rock, which have been rounded by\r\nwater and deposited with little or no sorting, so that larger and\r\nsmaller pebbles and sand all occur together. It is the deposit laid down\r\nby comparatively fast water in inland lakes or along the storm-beaten\r\nshores of the sea. Where a swift stream enters quiet water, as where it\r\nempties into a lake, there it quickly drops its coarse material as\r\ngravel, usually thus building a delta. Gravel also occurs in stream\r\nbeds, where for any reason the rate of flow is checked. During the\r\nrecent glacial period, the ice sheet brought down great masses of\r\nunsorted material, which was deposited as till, or in moraines. Much of\r\nthis was then picked up by the running water and moved longer or shorter\r\ndistances, so that, all over the glaciated country of the northern and\r\neastern United States, there are unusually large numbers of gravel\r\ndeposits. Gravels are all water laid, and usually show more or less\r\nclearly the bedded or stratified structure.\r\n\r\nThe size of the component pebbles of gravel ranges from great boulders\r\nto fine sand, and the finer gravels grade into the coarser sands, the\r\nline between gravel and sand being drawn at about the size of a pea, the\r\ncoarser being gravel, the finer sand.\r\n\r\nGravel is widely used as ballast for railroads and in making highways,\r\nbecause of its tendence to pack well, while the hard pebbles resist\r\nwear. It is also widely used in concrete work, bonding in well with the\r\ncement, and making it go from three to five times as far.\r\n\r\n\r\nConglomerate\r\nPl. 58\r\n\r\nConglomerates are composed of rounded pebbles and sand of varying sizes,\r\ncemented together into a solid rock. The pebbles may run up to boulders\r\nin size, but they have all been more or less rounded by water, and\r\ntransported some distance. The pebbles may all be of the same\r\ncomposition, or may represent a variety of rocks. When the pebbles are\r\nall, or most all, of one sort, the resulting conglomerate is termed a\r\n_quartz-conglomerate_, a _limestone-conglomerate_, a\r\n_gneiss-conglomerate_, etc. So too the cementing material varies in\r\nkind, silica, calcite and iron oxide being the commonest. The color will\r\ndepend on both the component pebbles and the cement, sometimes one\r\ndominating, sometimes the other. There are some of the quartz- and\r\nlimestone-conglomerates which can be cut and polished to make very\r\nhandsome stone.\r\n\r\nConglomerates represent consolidated gravels, and always indicate an\r\naqueous origin, quite often the delta of an ancient stream, or the\r\ninvasion of the sea over the land; so they have become of importance to\r\ngeologists in interpreting past events.\r\n\r\n\r\nSand\r\n\r\nSand is a mass of small rock particles, from the size of a pea down to\r\n¹/₅₀₀ of an inch in diameter. The material may be any sort of rock, or a\r\nmixture of two or more kinds. Sand may be the result of the\r\ndisintegration of older rocks at the point where it is now found, in\r\nwhich case the grains have the shapes they had in the original rock; but\r\nmore often the sand grains have been transported greater or lesser\r\ndistances, and in the process have been more or less rounded.\r\n\r\nThose sands, which lie where they were formed are called _residual_, and\r\nsuch sand is usually composed of a mixture of angular grains, some\r\nharder and others softer, such as quartz, feldspar, mica and hornblende,\r\nall mixed together. Where the sand has been transported, only the more\r\nresistant minerals have remained, such as quartz, magnetite,\r\ncassiderite, etc.; with which there are at times rarer minerals, such as\r\ngold, platinum, garnets or topaz. Such sands are known as\r\n_gold-bearing_, _topaz-bearing_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sands from different localities differ greatly. The streams gather\r\nthe rock particles, and sort them according to the size, which the water\r\nflowing at any given rate can carry. When the water is slowed down, it\r\ndrops all the particles above the size which the new rate of speed can\r\nhandle. The grains of sand from the bed of a stream are usually more or\r\nless angular. The further they are carried, the more they are knocked\r\ntogether and rounded; so that after being carried to the sea, and then\r\nthrown up on the beaches, they have been well rounded, especially the\r\nlarger grains. As the air is less viscid than the water, sand which is\r\ntransported by the wind, is even more rounded; so that desert sands show\r\nthe most complete rounding, indeed are even polished; and this is true\r\neven of the smaller grains. It is the wind-blown, or desert sands, which\r\nflow so evenly in an hourglass. Between the angular residual sands and\r\nthe polished desert sands, there are of course all grades. Glacial sands\r\nare angular or “sharp” almost to the degree characteristic of residual\r\nsands; and lake-shore sands are between river sands and sea sands in the\r\ndegree of rounding.\r\n\r\nSands made of particles of lime, _calcareous sands_, are less resistant\r\nto wear than are those of quartz. In regions where the water is “soft”\r\n(free from lime), they do not last long, as they are dissolved; but in a\r\nlimestone region where the water is “hard” (saturated with lime), the\r\ngrains are not so quickly dissolved and may accumulate into beds of\r\ngreat thickness, as in Florida. Along some shores of the ocean, there\r\noccur “green sands,” which are ordinary quartz sands mixed with the dark\r\ngreen mineral glauconite, which is a potassium iron silicate, forming on\r\nthe ocean bottom as a result of the action of decaying animal matter on\r\niron-bearing clays and potassium-bearing silicates, like feldspar. This\r\nis particularly characteristic of some of the sands along the coast of\r\nNew Jersey.\r\n\r\nIn places, especially in the beds of rivers, there occur “quicksands.”\r\nThis is a deposit of fine sand, mixed with a considerable amount of\r\nclay, and saturated with water; so that it will not support the weight\r\nof a man or an animal. Much that goes under the name of quicksand is a\r\nfluid mud, covered with a thin layer of sand.\r\n\r\nSand is used for a wide variety of commercial purposes, and under these\r\nconditions gets various trade names; for instance “glass sand” is a\r\npure, colorless to white, quartz sand, which is used as one of the\r\ncomponents in making glass. It must be free from impurities, as these\r\ncolor the glass, and much of the sand used for this purpose is quartz,\r\ncrushed to a fine sand-like condition. “Moulding sand” is a rather\r\nfine-grained quartz sand, with a small but very definite admixture of\r\nclay, and this is used to make the moulds for castings in foundries.\r\n“Polishing sand” is one composed of angular fragments of quartz, usually\r\nfrom stream beds or glacial deposits, or even crushed quartz, and is\r\nused for cutting and polishing marble, for sandpaper, and for polishing\r\nwood and softer stones. There are many other special uses, like\r\nbuilding, ballast, filters, furnaces, etc., in which quartz sand is\r\nused, being screened if necessary to get the right sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSandstone\r\n\r\nWhen sand of any sort is cemented so as to make a solid rock, it is\r\ntermed sandstone, which varies widely according to the size, color and\r\ncomposition of the grains, and also with the sort and amount of the\r\ncement. When the size of the grains is larger than that of a pea,\r\nsandstone grades into conglomerate; when smaller than ¹/₅₀₀th of an\r\ninch, especially if mixed with clay, it grades into shale. There are all\r\ngrades of firmness, due to the amount and kind of cement, ranging from\r\nthose which have little or no cement, but are compact as a result of the\r\npressure of the overlying rocks, to those in which the cement has filled\r\nall the pore spaces. In general there is a considerable amount of space\r\nbetween the grains of sand; so that a sandstone will absorb large\r\namounts of water, up to 25% of its bulk. In moist climates where it\r\nfreezes, this makes many sandstones unsuitable for use as building\r\nstones, as they are likely to spale, or chip off, as is seen in the\r\n“brown stone” so much used in New York City.\r\n\r\nSandstones are usually bedded rocks and are relatively easy to quarry,\r\nand most of them are not so firmly cemented, but that they can be\r\nreadily worked or cut into shape by the stone cutter; and so, certain\r\nsandstones are very popular for building stone or for trimming on\r\nbuildings, where they are not too much exposed to the weather.\r\n\r\nSandstone gets a variety of names according to the cement.\r\n\r\nSiliceous sandstone is cemented with silica and usually very hard.\r\n\r\nCalcareous sandstone is cemented with lime and usually rather soft.\r\n\r\nFerruginous sandstone is cemented with one of the iron oxides.\r\n\r\nArgillaceous sandstone is held together with clay impurities, and is\r\nusually both soft and of undesirable color.\r\n\r\nAccording to their composition there is also a number of varieties.\r\n\r\nArkose is a sandstone composed of quartz and feldspar grains, usually\r\nderived from the disintegration of granite and not transported far.\r\n\r\nGraywacke is a sandstone composed of quartz, feldspar, and some other\r\nmineral, like hornblende-augite, etc., also derived from the\r\ndisintegration of granites and not transported far.\r\n\r\nGrit is a term applied to a coarse sandstone, composed of angular quartz\r\nfragments, and used to a considerable extent for millstones.\r\n\r\nFlagstone is a thin bedded sandstone, often with mica, which splits\r\neasily and uniformly along the bedding planes; so that it can be\r\nquarried in large slabs. It was widely used for sidewalks before the\r\nadvent of concrete.\r\n\r\nFreestone is a thick-bedded sandstone, not over hard, so called, because\r\nit can be worked freely and equally well in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nClay\r\n\r\nClay is a term used to describe a mass of fine particles, the most\r\nprominent property of which is plasticity when wet. Clays range from\r\nmasses of pure kaolin to masses of kaolin and related minerals mixed\r\nwith as much as 60% of impurities, which may be sand, lime, iron oxides,\r\netc. The particles of a fine clay range around ¹/₁₀₀₀ of a millimeter in\r\ndiameter, while the impurities may be, and usually are, of larger size,\r\nup to the size of sand grains.\r\n\r\nAll clays are of secondary origin, the result of weathering, especially\r\nof feldspars, though clays may also result from the weathering of\r\nserpentines, gabbros, etc. In some cases after the weathering of\r\nfeldspar or limestones, the clay may remain just where it was formed, as\r\na residual deposit; but, being so fine-grained, it is usually\r\ntransported by rain water or by the wind and deposited somewhere else as\r\na sedimentary bed. The quiet waters of a lake are favorable places for\r\nsuch deposits, and many clay beds represent former lake bottoms. Impure\r\nclays are often laid down on the flood plains of sluggish streams. In\r\nfresh water the settling of the clay is a very slow process, requiring\r\ndays, or when very fine, weeks, before the water wholly clears. In salt\r\nwater, however, the clay sort of coagulates, the particles gathering\r\ntogether in tiny balls, which settle rapidly, so that the water is soon\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nAccording to their mode of origin clays are classified as residual,\r\nsedimentary, marine, swamp, lake, flood-plain, eolian, etc. But when\r\ntheir uses are considered a very different classification is made, based\r\nmostly on their composition, and we speak of China clays or kaolins,\r\nfire or refractory clays, paving-brick clays, sewer-pipe, stone-ware,\r\nbrick, gumbo and slip clays.\r\n\r\nThe kaolin or china clays are residual clays, usually resulting from the\r\ndecomposition of pegmatite dikes. They must be white when burned, free\r\nfrom iron oxides, and fairly plastic. A good deal of china clay is made\r\nby crushing feldspar.\r\n\r\nBall clays are sedimentary clays which remain white when burned, are\r\nusually very plastic, and free from iron oxides. They are mostly used in\r\nthe making of various sorts of china.\r\n\r\nFire clays may or may not have iron oxides in them, but they must be\r\nfree or nearly free from fluxing materials, such as lime, magnesia and\r\nthe alkalies (sodium and potassium compounds). They may be more or less\r\nplastic, the essential quality being their ability to withstand high\r\ntemperatures without fusing. Silica (as sand) tends to diminish the\r\nrefractory quality; so that a clay otherwise suitable, if it has sand in\r\nit, becomes at best a second grade fire clay. In coal mining sections it\r\nis customary to term those beds of clay either above or below the coal,\r\n“fire clay”; but this is an unfortunate designation, for though some of\r\nthem are true fire clays, the most of them are not.\r\n\r\nStone-ware clays are those with considerable sand and up to five per\r\ncent of fluxing materials. They must be plastic enough to be readily\r\nworked, and then burn to a dense body at comparatively low temperatures.\r\n\r\nSewer-pipe clays must be plastic, and carry a considerable amount of\r\nfluxing material, as the surface of the pipe is expected to vitrify in\r\nthe burning.\r\n\r\nBrick clays are low grade clays and vary greatly in composition. The\r\nmain requisites are that they mould easily and bake hard at relatively\r\nlow temperatures with as little warping and cracking as possible. As\r\nmost clays shrink both in the air drying and in the baking, sand is\r\nadded when the clay is being mixed. The color is mostly due to the\r\npresence of iron impurities. If there are iron oxides and little or no\r\nlime, the brick bakes to a red color, but if there is an excess of lime\r\nover the iron oxides, it bakes to a cream or buff color, which on\r\nvitrifying turns green.\r\n\r\nPaving-brick clays range from surface clays, to semirefractory clays,\r\nshale being often used. The essential component is enough fluxing\r\nmaterial, so that the bricks shall begin to vitrify, or fuse, at not too\r\nhigh temperatures.\r\n\r\nSlip clays are those with a high percentage of fluxing material; so\r\nthat, when baked at moderate temperatures, the surface fuses into a\r\nglassy brown or green glaze.\r\n\r\nAdobe is an impure calcareous clay, widely used in the western United\r\nStates for making sun-dried bricks.\r\n\r\nGumbo is a term applied to fine-grained plastic clays which shrink too\r\nmuch in the burning to be useful in manufactures. They can be burned to\r\nmake an excellent ballast for railroads and highways. They are\r\nespecially abundant in the Middle Western States.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoess\r\n\r\nThis is the name given to a fine grained homogeneous clay-like material,\r\nwhich is a mixture of clay, fine angular fragments of sand, flakes of\r\nmica and more or less calcareous matter. It is usually without\r\nstratification, and cleaves vertically, so that, when eroded, it forms\r\nsteep cliffs. Loess covers great areas in the Mississippi Valley, in the\r\nRhine Valley, and in North Central China. By some it is thought to be an\r\naccumulation of dust in those regions where the prevailing winds were of\r\ndiminished velocity and where the grass or other vegetation has served\r\nto catch and hold the material; by others it is thought of as a river\r\nand lake deposit; and by still others it is thought to be due to the\r\ncombination of the two modes, wind and flood. The writer inclines to the\r\nfirst view expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nShale\r\nPl. 59\r\n\r\nWhen pure or impure clays, or loess, are consolidated, they are all\r\ngrouped under the name shale. It usually possesses a layered or\r\nstratified structure, which makes it possible to split it into thin\r\nlayers. Of all the sedimentary rocks shale is the commonest, and it may\r\noccur in all the places where clay could occur, but the most widely\r\ndistributed shale is that which made the sea bottom of former times and\r\nis more or less calcareous, like the piece on Plate 59, in which bits of\r\nshells are still visible. Shale has the same wide variation in\r\ncomposition as has clay, the various types being designated according to\r\nthe impurity which is present, as:\r\n\r\n_argillaceous shale_, made mostly of clay,\r\n\r\n_arenaceous shale_, shale with more or less sand as an impurity,\r\n\r\n_calcareous shale_, or one with more or less lime as an impurity,\r\n\r\n_ferruginous shale_, or one with iron compounds as impurities,\r\n\r\n_bituminous shale_, or one colored black by the presence of organic\r\nmatter, remains of either plants or animals.\r\n\r\nWhile of no value as building material, shale may be ground or crushed,\r\nand used as a substitute for any corresponding clay, and thus many\r\nmanufacturers use shale in making fire-clay products, bricks, tile, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarl\r\n\r\nWhere limestones or shells of any sort have been pulverized, and mixed\r\nwith more or less impurities, especially clay, the resulting\r\nunconsolidated mass is known as marl. It is usually associated with\r\nmarine formations, and is the finer débris which has settled on the\r\nocean bottom well out from shore, that is out beyond the sandy and mud\r\ndeposits. Finding it therefore usually indicates a sea bottom recently\r\nelevated. It is very characteristic of the southern coastal states, from\r\nMaryland all along to Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimestone\r\n\r\nAny mass of marl, or aggregate of calcareous shells, corals, etc., which\r\nhas become consolidated is known as limestone. It may, and usually does,\r\nhave a wide range of impurities, chief of which are clay, sand, iron\r\noxides, and bituminous matter, like plant or animal remains. Pure\r\nlimestone is white, but due to impurities it ranges through grays,\r\ngreens, browns, to black, and even red, but this last is rarer. It is\r\neasily identified by the presence of calcium carbonate, which\r\neffervesces in hydrochloric acid. It most often represents deposits in\r\nfairly deep water on ocean bottoms of the past, but there is also a wide\r\nrange of limestones which were formed in fresh water.\r\n\r\nLimestone is often burned at temperatures just above 900° C, at which\r\npoint carbon dioxide goes off as a gas, and leaves calcium oxide, or\r\nlime. When this is mixed with water it makes calcium hydroxide, or\r\nslaked lime, which is mixed with sand to give it body, and is used as\r\nmortar. When exposed to the air, the slaked lime gives up water, and\r\ntakes back from the air carbon dioxide, and again becomes calcium\r\ncarbonate with its original hardness. Limestone is also used as one of\r\nthe elements in all cements. It is also considerably used as a building\r\nstone, which, however, suffers in moist climates from the solution of\r\nits lime by rains, but has stood up very well in dry climates.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of limestone are mostly distinguished according to their\r\nmode of origin, some of them being as follows.\r\n\r\nBog Lime is a white calcareous powdery deposit on the bottom of ponds in\r\nlimestone regions, a deposit precipitated from solution by the action of\r\nthe plants inhabiting the ponds.\r\n\r\nCoquina (Plate 59) is the rock formed by the rather loose consolidation\r\nof shells and shell fragments. It is particularly characteristic of\r\ntropical regions, and is very abundant near St. Augustine, Fla., in\r\nwhich region it was, and still is, cut into blocks and used for building\r\nstone. In that mild climate it has stood very well.\r\n\r\nChalk (Plate 60) is a soft fine-grained limestone, formed in the ocean\r\nby the accumulation of myriads of the tiny shells of Foramenifera, which\r\nare single celled animals, living either a floating life near the\r\nsurface of the sea, or a creeping life on the bottom. Chalk is composed\r\nmostly of the shells of floating Foramenifera, which when the animals\r\ndied, settled to the bottom and there accumulated, mostly at depths of\r\n600 feet or more. When the mass of unconsolidated shells is dredged up\r\nfrom depths of 50 to 2000 fathoms, it is known as _Foramenifera ooze_.\r\nChalk beds are then indications of an uplifted sea bottom. When\r\nconsolidated, if pure or nearly so, it makes a white chalk, and the beds\r\nmay be of considerable thickness, as is the case of the famous cliffs\r\nnear Dover on either side of the English Channel. One of Huxley’s most\r\nfamous lectures is the one on chalk, found in his _Essays and Lay\r\nSermons_.\r\n\r\nCoral Rock is made by the cementation of fragments of corals. The\r\nbinding material, as in most stones, is lime; and this sort of rock is\r\nassociated with coral reefs of either the past or the present. One of\r\nthe best illustrations of this being the “Dolomite Mountains” in Tyrol.\r\nCoral rock, like coquina, has been cut into blocks and used as building\r\nstone, as in Bermuda.\r\n\r\nEncrinal Limestone (Plate 60) is a rock made by the cementation of\r\nfragments of the skeleton of crinoids. These animals belong to the\r\ngroup, echinoderms, and are now extinct except for a few so called\r\n“sea-lilies.” They were animals with a central mouth surrounded by long,\r\njointed, flexible arms in multiples of five, and below this a small body\r\ninclosed in calcareous plates, all at the top of a long jointed stem.\r\nThey lived in the sea and in the earlier geological times must have been\r\nvery abundant; for their remains are so common in places as to make\r\nwhole layers of limestone.\r\n\r\nHydraulic Limestone is a fine-grained, compact, yellowish limestone with\r\nfrom 13 to 17% of sand, and some clay; which, when it is burned at a\r\ntemperature a little higher than that used in burning lime, makes a\r\nproduct, that, while not as strong as Portland cement, still like it\r\nsets under water.\r\n\r\nLithographic Limestone is a very fine-grained, compact limestone with\r\nclay impurities, the finest of the grain making it usable for making the\r\nstone plates used in lithographic printing. On slabs of this limestone\r\nfigures are drawn in reverse with a special crayon. Then the slab is\r\ntreated with acid, those parts which are not protected by the drawing\r\nbeing etched away, while the points protected by the drawing remain in\r\nlow relief. From this slab figures can then be printed.\r\n\r\nTravertine is a general name, applied to calcareous deposits from fresh\r\nwater lakes or streams, and has been precipitated either as a result of\r\ncooling or evaporation. Some travertines are porous, while others are\r\ndense; some are white, while others are colored, often beautifully, by\r\nimpurities in the water.\r\n\r\nPorous deposits of travertine, when made on grass or other like\r\nsubstances, are known as tufa or _calc sinter_. Such masses are common\r\naround Caledonia, N. Y., Mammoth Hot Springs in the Yellowstone Park,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOnyx marble is a dense travertine, usually formed as a result of the\r\ndeposition of lime from the water of springs. It is often banded, due to\r\nthe presence of impurities in the water at one time, and their absence\r\nat other times.\r\n\r\n\r\nTill\r\n\r\nTill is an unconsolidated mass of boulders, pebbles, sand and fine clay,\r\nthe unsorted material left behind by glaciers when they melted. The\r\nboulders and pebbles, while they show some wear, are not rounded like\r\nthose that have been transported by streams, but have a more or less\r\nangular shape; and some of them are polished or striated on one side,\r\nwhere, while frozen in the ice, they were rubbed along the bottom.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent geological events in America was the extension of\r\nthe ice sheet, now covering Greenland, down over north and northeastern\r\nNorth America, until it extended as far south as northern New Jersey,\r\nthe Ohio River and the Missouri River, and as far west as the Rocky\r\nMountains, but not over the Great Basin, the Cascade Ranges or Alaska.\r\nThis great mass of ice, thousands of feet thick, moved from two centers,\r\none either side of Hudson Bay, scraping up the loose soil, and grinding\r\noff the exposed surfaces of the underlying rock. All this material it\r\ncarried southward, until the melting along its lower margin equaled the\r\nrate at which it advanced. When the melting was faster than the advance\r\nthe glacial sheet retreated. At the southern limit of the advance this\r\ndébris was dropped, either making long ridges (moraines) or while the\r\nice was retreating, thicker or thinner sheets. This deposited débris is\r\ntill.\r\n\r\nThe soil, and especially the subsoil, in all the regions formerly\r\ncovered by the ice sheet, is made up very largely of this till; which,\r\nwhere it is undisturbed is often called “hardpan.” When till is mixed\r\nwith humus it becomes loam. This mixture of material, varying all the\r\nway from the fine powdered products of the ice grinding to the great\r\nboulder it picked up and carried south, is characteristic of this or any\r\nother glaciated country. When this section of country was settled, the\r\nboulders and stone were a hindrance to cultivation, and were picked up\r\nand piled into stone walls, which are one of the first features to\r\nstrike the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nTillite\r\n\r\nWhen till is consolidated into solid rock, it is known as tillite. In\r\nseveral cases it has been found buried far beneath the more recent\r\nsedimentary rocks; testifying that there were other glacial periods\r\nbeside the last one which furnished the till.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Coal Series\r\n\r\nDisregarding minor constituents, the plants are largely made up of\r\ncellulose, which is a combination of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,\r\n(C₆H₁₀O₅). If this is heated in the air, where there is plenty of\r\noxygen, it disintegrates, or burns, making carbon dioxide and water; but\r\nif the heating is done where the oxygen is excluded, as in a kiln, the\r\nhydrogen and oxygen will be driven off and the carbon will remain behind\r\nas charcoal. In Nature similar reactions go on, but more slowly.\r\nVegetable matter, exposed to the air, disintegrates into carbon dioxide\r\nand water, and there is no solid residue. However, if the vegetable\r\nmatter is under water, which excludes the air more or less completely\r\nincluding the oxygen in it, then disintegration still takes place, but\r\nthe products formed are water, (H₂O) marsh gas (CH₄), and some carbon\r\ndioxide (CO₂), but a considerable part of the carbon remains behind and\r\naccumulates.\r\n\r\nThus in bogs, swamps and ponds, where dead vegetation, especially that\r\ngrowing in the water, piles up, the oxidation is incomplete; so that\r\nthere gradually accumulates on the bottom a layer of brown to black mud,\r\nknown as _peat_. More plant remains are constantly being added, and the\r\nlayer may increase to several feet in thickness. The decomposition is\r\nincomplete and some oxygen and hydrogen remain, but the carbon is in a\r\nconstantly increasing ratio and in proportion far above that in\r\ncellulose. In the cold northern climates sphagnum moss is the most\r\nefficient peat producing plant, but in temperate and tropical climates\r\nthe moss is replaced by the leaves, twigs, trunks, etc., of trees,\r\nbushes, and vines.\r\n\r\nIf these peat beds are buried beneath a layer or layers of sediment,\r\nespecially clay, the peat is sealed up and oxidation stops almost\r\nentirely. With the pressure of the superincumbent beds, the peat becomes\r\nmore and more compact, and changes to a dark-brown or black color. It is\r\nthen known as _lignite_. If this lignite is buried still deeper, with\r\nconsequently more pressure and more time, it changes into the still\r\ndenser black _bituminous coal_. This is as far as it will go unless some\r\nnew agent is added to the forces already working.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the series of changes forming coal is associated with\r\nmountain making. In case the layers of rock containing beds of coal are\r\nfolded, and that presupposes at least a moderate increase in heat, the\r\nbituminous coal is altered to _anthracite_, which is still denser, and\r\nso hard that it breaks with a conchoidal fracture. Alteration may be\r\ncarried a step still farther, in case the rocks between which lie beds\r\nof coal are effected by such high temperatures as accompany\r\nmetamorphism. Then all the associated hydrogen, oxygen and moisture are\r\ndriven off, and only the carbon remains, which is then known as\r\n_graphite_. All steps between the stages especially designated occur.\r\nThe following represent steps only in the series of changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeat\r\n\r\nPeat is a mass of unconsolidated vegetable matter, which has accumulated\r\nunder water, and in which the original plant remains are still, at least\r\nin part, discernible. It contains a large amount of water, so that\r\nbefore it can be used as a fuel, it is cut out in blocks, which are\r\npiled up and left for a time to dry before using. It burns with a long\r\nflame and considerable smoke. This country is so well supplied with\r\nother fuels, that so far peat has been but little used.\r\n\r\n\r\nLignite\r\n_brown coal_\r\n\r\nLignite is more compact than peat, and is found buried to some depth\r\nunder layers of clay or sandstone. It is dark brown to black in color,\r\nand still retains pretty clear traces of the plants from which it was\r\nderived. It also usually contains a considerable amount of moisture, and\r\nwhen this is dried out, it tends to crumble badly, so that it is\r\nundesirable to handle it much, or to ship it far, before using. It has a\r\nfair fuel value and is fairly widely used; but it is very desirable that\r\nsome method be found, by which lignite could be treated to obtain its\r\nby-products, and at the same time make it more compact, so it would not\r\ncrumble with the handling incident to using it in furnaces. There are\r\nextensive lignite deposits in this country in North and South Dakota,\r\nMontana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\nBituminous Coal\r\n_soft coal_\r\n\r\nThis type of coal is compact, black in color, and breaks readily, but\r\ndoes not crumble as badly as lignite. It contains considerable water,\r\nand still has some hydrogen and oxygen compounds in it. Bituminous coal\r\nis the product of plant remains which have been preserved for long\r\nperiods, (millions of years), sealed from the air by the overlying beds\r\nof rock. The pressure has made it compact, and nearly all traces of the\r\noriginal plants have disappeared.\r\n\r\nBituminous coal is our most abundant fuel, occurring the world over in\r\nseams from less than an inch in thickness to some over fifteen feet\r\nthick. The United States is peculiarly fortunate in the abundant and\r\neasily accessible deposits of this type of coal, in Pennsylvania, West\r\nVirginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa,\r\nMissouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, Utah, and Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe volatile constituents, hydrogen and oxygen compounds, of bituminous\r\ncoal may be driven off by heating the coal in closed ovens, and the\r\nresidual mass is known as _coke_, almost pure carbon. This is\r\ndistillation, and the ovens in which this is done, without trying to\r\nsave the volatile products, are called bee-hive ovens, while the more\r\nmodern ovens which save the by-products are called by-products ovens. A\r\nton of bituminous coal treated in the typical by-products oven, will\r\nyield on the average 1410 lb. of coke, 7.1 gallons of tar, 18.9 pounds\r\nof ammonia sulphate, etc., 2.4 gallons of light oils, 10440 cubic feet\r\nof illuminating gas, about half of this last being used to furnish the\r\nheat for the distillation. The coal-tar dye industry is built on the tar\r\nthus produced. Toluol, benzol, etc., come from the light oils; and half\r\nthe gas produced is available for household illumination, etc. Coke is\r\ndemanded, as it is a superior fuel for melting iron ores, iron and\r\nsteel, and is made regardless of whether the by-products are used. The\r\ncoke thus produced is hard, clean, and vesicular; but for some reason as\r\nyet unknown, by no means all bituminous coal will produce a coke which\r\nhas this porous structure. These latter are known as “non-coking,” and\r\nare of little use to the steel industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannel Coal\r\n\r\nThis is a compact variety of non-coking bituminous coal, with a dull\r\nluster and a conchoidal fracture. It contains the largest proportion of\r\nvolatile hydrocarbon compounds of any variety of coal; so that when the\r\nsupply of petroleum and natural gas gives out, this will be one of the\r\nimportant sources of obtaining substitutes. Cannel coals occur in Ohio,\r\nIndiana, and eastern Kentucky. This cannel coal owes its peculiar fatty\r\nnature to the material from which it is derived, it being supposed to\r\nhave resulted from the accumulation of the spores of lycopod trees, and\r\ntheir conversion to jelly-like masses by bacteria in the fresh-water\r\nmarshes of those ancient days.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthracite\r\n_hard coal_\r\n\r\nAnthracite coal is hard, black, has a luster, and breaks with a\r\nconchoidal fracture. It contains but a low percentage of volatile\r\nmatter, and so burns with a short flame, and less smoke, than is the\r\ncase with the other coals. It is always associated with folded rocks,\r\nand appears to have been formed as a result of the combined pressure and\r\nthe higher temperatures, which accompanied mountain making. Still the\r\ntemperature was not high enough to metamorphose the adjacent rocks. Most\r\nof our anthracite comes from northeastern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbonite\r\n\r\nCarbonite is natural coke. It occurs in coal seams which have been cut\r\nby dikes or intrusions of igneous rocks, the coal having been thus coked\r\nby natural processes. It is not vesicular like artificial coke, for\r\nwhich reason it is not useful as a fuel. Some carbonite is found in the\r\nCerillos coal field of New Mexico, in Colorado, and Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nJet\r\n\r\nJet is a dense variety of lignite, a fossil wood of black color, which\r\ntakes a high polish and cuts easily into various ornamental shapes. It\r\nhas been used for ornaments since early ancient times, beads of jet\r\nbeing found in the early bronze period in England, the supply probably\r\ncoming from the Yorkshire coast, whence the principal supply comes even\r\nto the present day. In Switzerland and Belgium it was used still\r\nearlier, even as far back as the Palæolithic age. Jet seems then to have\r\nhad a talismanic value, and to have been worn to protect the owner.\r\nAbout 700 A.D. crosses and rosaries began to be made of jet, the custom\r\nstarting at Whitby Abbey, the material being obtained nearby, so that it\r\ncame to be known as “Whitby jet,” and in the eighteenth century became\r\nvery popular. In recent times it has been used mostly as jewelry\r\nsuitable for mourning.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmber\r\nPl. 61\r\n\r\nAmber is a gum which oozed from coniferous trees and was petrified. It\r\nis associated with lignite beds of middle Tertiary age. It is usually\r\npale-yellow in color, but at times has a reddish or brownish tinge, and\r\nis more or less transparent. It occurs in rounded irregular lumps, up to\r\nten pounds in weight, though most pieces are smaller; and is mostly\r\npicked up along certain coasts where it is washed ashore by the waves.\r\nSince the earliest records amber has been cast up on the shores of the\r\nBaltic, and it was used by peoples as early as in the stone age for\r\nornaments and amulets. It has been found among the remains of the cave\r\ndwellers of Switzerland, in Assyrian and Egyptian ruins of prehistoric\r\nage, and in Mycenæ in the prehistoric graves of the Greeks, the first\r\nrecorded reference to it being in Homer, and the Greek name for amber\r\nbeing _elektron_ from which our word electricity comes. All these finds\r\nwere of Baltic amber which was doubtless gathered and traded by those\r\nearly men. Even down to the present many men make their living, riding\r\nalong the shore at low tide and hunting for the amber washed ashore by\r\nthe waves. As early as 1860 the German geologists concluded that the\r\nsource of the amber must be lignite beds outcropping beneath the sea\r\nlevel, and started mining for the amber with fair success, so that today\r\ntwo types of Baltic amber are distinguished, “sea stone” which is washed\r\nashore, and “mine stone” taken from the mines. Beside the Baltic\r\nlocality, it is found along the shores of the Adriatic, Sicily, France,\r\nChina, and occasionally of North America.\r\n\r\nSome pieces of amber are found with insects inclosed and preserved\r\nalmost as perfectly as if collected yesterday. They were apparently\r\nentangled in the gum while still viscid and completely embedded, before\r\nfossilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Petroleum Series\r\n\r\nCertain sedimentary rocks contain larger or smaller quantities of\r\nnatural gas, petroleum, mineral tar and asphalt. These are compounds of\r\ncarbon and hydrogen, or hydrocarbons, and range from gases to solids,\r\neach being a mixture of two or more hydrocarbon compounds. The crude\r\npetroleum may have either a paraffin base or an asphalt base: in the\r\nformer case, when the gas, gasoline, kerosene, etc., have been removed\r\nby distillation, the solid residue will be paraffin, as in most of the\r\nPennsylvania crude oils; while in the latter case, the solid residue\r\nwill be an asphalt, as in most of the California and Texas crude oils.\r\nIn the case of the paraffin series all the compounds belong to the\r\nparaffin group, while the asphalt is due to the presence, in addition to\r\nthe paraffin group, of some of the benzine series of hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nPetroleum is found in sands and shales, which were originally deposited\r\non ancient sea bottoms, the shales generally being the real source of\r\nthe petroleum. The oil was once the fatty portion of animal bodies\r\n(perhaps to some extent of plant bodies), and was separated during\r\ndecomposition as a result of bacterial activity. Oil thus produced is in\r\ntiny droplets, which have a great affinity for clay. After being freed\r\nby the bacteria, the oil droplets in muddy water attach themselves to\r\nparticles of clay, and as the clay settles the oil is carried down with\r\nit, the two eventually making a bituminous shale. In clear water, or in\r\nwater which is in motion, the oil droplets rise to the surface and\r\neventually distill into the air.\r\n\r\nThe oil, or petroleum, may stay diffused through the shales, in which\r\ncase we have _oil-bearing shales_, with sometimes as much as 20% of oil.\r\nWere there but ¹/₁₀₀₀ of a per cent of oil in a layer of shale 1500 feet\r\nthick, this would amount to 750,000 barrels per square mile which is\r\nequal to a rich production from wells. When the oil in shale amounts to\r\nthree per cent or more, it is commercially usable. There are large\r\nstretches of petroleum-bearing rocks in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\nIndiana, and all the way out to the Pacific coast, some of them with oil\r\nso abundant, that a blow of the hammer will cause them to smell of\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\nIn case these oil-bearing shales have been heavily overburdened and\r\ncompressed, the petroleum may have been more or less completely pressed\r\nout of them. Then the droplets uniting have formed a liquid, which has\r\nmoved out from the shale, and gone wherever it could find open spaces.\r\nSandstones have frequently offered their pore space, and as it filled,\r\nhave been thus saturated with petroleum. If the sandstones were open to\r\nthe air, or if fissures extended from them to the surface, the oil has\r\nescaped to the surface and evaporated into the air. But in those cases\r\nwhere the sandstone (or other permeable rocks) was covered by an\r\nimpervious layer, like a dense shale or clay, the oil was confined below\r\nthe covering layer of rock. Crude oil is lighter than water; so that\r\nwhen natural gas, petroleum and water were all present in the rocks, the\r\ngas lies on top, the petroleum next, and the water underneath. With this\r\nin mind it is easy to see, that in slightly folded or undulating layers\r\nof rock, the gas and petroleum would be caught under upraised folds and\r\ndomes. This is the basis of prospecting for oil.\r\n\r\nIf petroleum-bearing layers are depressed far enough beneath the surface\r\nto be affected by the high temperatures of the earth’s interior, or have\r\nbeen near volcanic activity, of course the petroleum has been distilled\r\nby natural processes, and at most only the residues, like paraffin or\r\nasphalt, have remained. For this reason it is impossible to find\r\npetroleum in igneous or metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural gas\r\n\r\nNatural gas is the lightest portion of crude oil, and consists mostly of\r\nmarsh gas (“fire damp,” CH₄) together with other light hydrocarbons,\r\nlike ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and some carbon dioxide and\r\nmonoxide. It is colorless, odorless, and burns with a luminous flame.\r\nMixed with air it is explosive. It is found in sedimentary rocks, mostly\r\nsandstones, either with or without petroleum. Usually it is under\r\nconsiderable pressure, and escapes with great force wherever a hole\r\npermits. In time the gas all escapes through the hole or well, and then\r\nthe well “runs out.” If petroleum is present under the natural gas, the\r\nhole may become an “oil well,” from which petroleum may be pumped, until\r\nit in turn is exhausted. The end of an oil supply is usually indicated\r\nby the appearance of water in the well. Natural gas is mostly associated\r\nwith oil districts, as in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Texas,\r\nCalifornia, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetroleum Crude Oil\r\nPl. 61\r\n\r\nPetroleum is a mixture of paraffin compounds all the way from the gases,\r\nthrough gasoline, kerosene, lubricating oils, and vasoline to paraffin.\r\nIn some of the crude oils there is also an admixture of compounds from\r\nthe benzine series, in which case, when all the volatile compounds have\r\nbeen distilled off, an asphalt remains. The different components of\r\npetroleum may be separated out by heating the crude oil in closed tanks,\r\nand drawing off the various substances at the proper temperatures.\r\n\r\nPetroleum occurs in sedimentary rocks of marine origin, usually rocks\r\nwhich also contain the shells of some of the animals, the soft parts of\r\nwhich made the oil. To have been preserved the millions of years since\r\nthe petroleum was first formed, the oil-bearing layers must have been\r\ncovered by some impervious layer of rock, beneath the domes and\r\nanticlines of which the oil has lain ever since. When such a dome or\r\nanticlinal fold is perforated by a well, the released oil flows to the\r\nsurface with a greater or less rush, according to the pressure. Wells\r\nmay keep flowing for 20 years, sometimes more, sometimes much less.\r\nThose which flow with the greatest pressure usually are relatively short\r\nlived, at times lasting only a year or two. When this easily obtained\r\noil is exhausted, there is an even greater supply to be obtained by the\r\ndistillation of the bituminous shales. Petroleum never occurs in igneous\r\nor metamorphic rocks, but is found in either sandstones or shales, in\r\nplaces favorable for accumulation, all across that great stretch of\r\nancient sea bottoms, extending from the Appalachian Mountains to the\r\nRocky Mountains, and in the Great Basin between the Rocky Mountains and\r\nthe Sierra Nevada Range, and also to the west of the Sierras.\r\n\r\n\r\nBitumen\r\n\r\nWhere petroleum has escaped through pores in the rocks, or by way of\r\nfissures, and has come to the surface of the earth, the lighter\r\ncomponents, thus exposed to the air, have vaporized and escaped, leaving\r\nbehind a more or less solid residue, which is known as bitumen. If the\r\nescape was through a fissure, the bitumen may have accumulated in the\r\nfissure until it was filled, making vein bitumen. Or the escape may have\r\nbeen so rapid that the petroleum formed a pool or lake from the surface\r\nof which evaporation took place. In time such a pool will give off the\r\ngases and volatile compounds, only a residue remaining to make a pitch\r\nlake, like the one at Rancho Le Brea near Los Angeles, or an asphalt\r\nlake like the one on the island of Trinidad. On account of their varying\r\nhardness and composition, some of these bitumens have received special\r\nnames; as:\r\n\r\nAlbertite, a black bitumen with a brilliant luster on broken surfaces, a\r\nhardness between 1 and 2, and a specific gravity a shade over 1.\r\n\r\nGrahamite, a black bitumen, which is brittle, but has a dull luster, a\r\nhardness of 2, and a specific gravity of 1.15.\r\n\r\nGilsonite or Uintaite, a black bitumen with a brilliant luster and a\r\nconchoidal fracture, a hardness of 2 to 2½, and a specific gravity of\r\n1.06.\r\n\r\nMalta is a semi-liquid viscid natural bitumen, which has a considerable\r\ndistribution in California.\r\n\r\nThe above varieties of bitumen look a good deal like coal, but are\r\neasily distinguished by their lightness (weight about half that of\r\ncoal), and the fact that with only moderate heat they melt, and become a\r\nthick liquid like tar.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuano\r\n\r\nGuano is the accumulation of the excrement of birds (or of other animals\r\nlike bats) on areas so dry that, though soluble, it is not leached and\r\nwashed away. It may also contain some of the bones and mummified\r\ncarcasses of the birds which died on the spot. The greatest of these\r\ndeposits are on several small islands, just off the west coast of Peru,\r\nand now “farmed” by the Peruvian government. In this country there are\r\nno true guano beds, except a few accumulations of bat guano in certain\r\ncaves of Kentucky and Texas, but these are not large enough to become of\r\ncommercial importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhosphate Rock\r\n\r\nPhosphate rock is one composed chiefly of calcium phosphate along with\r\nvarious impurities, such as clay and lime. It occurs in beds, irregular\r\nmasses, or as concretionary nodules in limestone or sand.\r\n\r\nThe bedded varieties are in the older sedimentary rocks, in which the\r\nphosphate runs from a small percentage up to as high as 85%. Ultimately\r\nthe phosphate came from either animal excrement, or from bacterial\r\ndecomposition of animal carcasses and bones. In all the beds it seems to\r\nbe true that in the first instance the phosphate was laid down as a\r\ndisseminated deposit in marine beds, usually limestones. Later by the\r\naction of water leaching through the rocks, the phosphate was dissolved,\r\nand then redeposited elsewhere in a more concentrated form. This may be\r\neither in the underlying sandstones, but is more often in limestones,\r\nreplacing the original lime.\r\n\r\nIn these secondary deposits, if the phosphate has been laid down in\r\ncavities, the resulting phosphate will be in nodular masses. In the case\r\nof the Florida and Carolina deposits, these nodules have been freed from\r\ntheir matrix and washed along the river beds, remaining as pebbles in\r\nthe river sands. The bed deposits are mostly in Kentucky and Idaho. The\r\ncommercial use for such phosphate rocks is of course the making of\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiatomaceous Earth\r\nPl. 62\r\n\r\nDiatoms are tiny single-celled plants living in uncounted millions in\r\nthe fresh and salt water. Each diatom builds around itself two shells\r\nwhich fit into each other like the cover and box of a pill-box, and each\r\nshell is marvelously ornamented. The shells are composed of silica of\r\nthe opal type. In size the diatoms range from ¹/₅₀₀₀ of an inch in\r\ndiameter up to the size of a pin head, and they live in such numbers\r\nthat ordinary surface waters have hundreds of them to the quart, and\r\nwhere they are flourishing up to 250,000 in a quart. When the plants\r\ndie, or in order to reproduce abandon the shells, these shells fall to\r\nthe bottom of the pond or the sea, and there accumulate, often making a\r\nlayer from a few inches thick up to hundreds of feet in extreme cases.\r\nIf unconsolidated, this mass of tiny shells is known as diatomaceous\r\nearth; but if they are consolidated it is called tripolite, so named\r\nbecause the first of them used commercially came from Tripoli.\r\n\r\nAs the shells are tiny and uniform in size and have a hardness of 6, the\r\ndiatomaceous earth is used to make a great variety of polishes, scouring\r\nsoaps, tooth paste, as a filler in certain kinds of paper, in making\r\nwaterglass, as an absorbent for nitroglycerine, and as packing in\r\ninsulating compounds, where asbestos would otherwise be used.\r\n\r\nDeposits of freshwater diatoms are found all over the United States,\r\nusually in thin layers of limited extent, especially in Massachusetts,\r\nNew York, Michigan, etc. The marine deposits of diatoms are on a much\r\nlarger scale, there being beds of diatoms in Anne Arundel, Calvert and\r\nCharles Counties, Md., up to 25 or 30 feet in thickness. In Santa\r\nBarbara County, Cal., there is one bed 2400 feet thick and another 4700\r\nfeet thick, beside many other smaller ones. The enormous former wealth\r\nof life indicated by these great deposits may be suggested, when it is\r\nremembered that it takes about 120,000,000 to make an ounce in weight.\r\nThey reproduce on an average about once in five days, so that from a\r\nsingle diatom the offspring possible under favorable conditions would\r\namount to over 16,000,000 in four months or over 60 tons in a year. Of\r\nsuch an order is the potential increase of animals or plants, no matter\r\nhow small, if the rate of reproduction is high.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Metamorphic Rocks\r\n\r\nEither a sedimentary or an igneous rock, which has been altered by the\r\ncombined activities of heat, pressure and chemical action, becomes a\r\nmetamorphic rock. The process is essentially one, during which the\r\nlayers of rock come under the influence of such temperatures as are\r\nassociated with the formation of granite or lavas. Such material as is\r\nactually melted becomes igneous rock, but adjacent to the masses\r\nactually melted are other rocks which do not melt but, according to the\r\ntemperature, are more or less changed, and these are the metamorphic\r\nrocks. At a distance from the molten masses the changes are minor, but\r\nclose to the molten magmas extensive changes take place. Though not\r\nactually melted the rock near the heat center may be softened, usually\r\nis, in which case pebbles and grains or even crystals become soft and\r\nplastic, and, as a result of the great pressure, are flattened, giving\r\nthe rock, when it cools again, a striated appearance. At these high\r\ntemperatures the water in the rock and also some other substances\r\nvaporize, and the hot steam and vapor are active agents in making a\r\ngreat many chemical changes. In some cases material like clay is changed\r\ninto micas, or chlorite, etc.; in other cases the elements of a mineral\r\nwill be segregated and large crystals will appear scattered through the\r\nmetamorphic rock, such as garnets, staurolites, etc.\r\n\r\nIf one studies a layer of rock both near and far from the molten mass,\r\nall grades of change will appear. For example, at a distance a\r\nconglomerate maybe unaltered; somewhat nearer the molten mass, the heat\r\nand steam may have softened (but not melted) the pebbles and then the\r\npressure has flattened them as though they were dough; and nearest the\r\nmolten mass, the outlines of the pebbles are lost, only a layered effect\r\nremaining, and many of the materials have changed into new minerals,\r\nlike mica, garnets, etc., but still the layered effect is preserved.\r\n\r\nOne of the effects of heat and pressure is to flatten the component\r\nparticles of the rock, so that it tends to split in a direction at right\r\nangles to the direction of the pressure, just as particles of flour are\r\nsoftened and flattened under the pressure of the roller; and then when\r\nthe crust is baked it splits or cleaves at right angles to the direction\r\nin which the pressure was exerted by the roller. This tendency to split\r\nis not to be confused with either the layering, characteristic of\r\nsedimentary rocks, nor the cleavage characteristic of minerals. It has\r\nnothing to do with the way the particles were originally deposited, nor\r\nwith their cleavage; but is due to the pressure, and resembles the pie\r\ncrust splitting, being irregular and flaky. This is designated\r\n_schistosity_ if irregular and _slaty cleavage_ if regular. Schistosity\r\nrefers to the flaky manner of splitting into thin scales as in mica\r\nschists. Slaty cleavage is more regular, this being due to the fact that\r\nthe material of which slate is made is small particles of clay of\r\nuniform size.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic rocks are generally more or less folded, as they are\r\nalways associated with mountain making. These major folds are of large\r\nsize, from a hundred feet across to several miles from one side to the\r\nother. Such folds may also occur in sedimentary rocks or even in igneous\r\nrocks and simply express the great lines of yielding, or movement of the\r\ncrust of the earth. In addition to this there is minor folding or\r\ncontorting which is characteristic of metamorphic rocks only. When the\r\nrocks were heated by their nearness to the molten igneous magmas, they\r\nmust expand, but being overburdened by thick layers of other rocks,\r\nthere is no opportunity for yielding vertically, so the layers crumple,\r\nmaking minor folds from a fraction of an inch to a few feet across. Such\r\ncrumpling, which is so very conspicuous especially where there are bands\r\nof quartzite in the rock, is entirely characteristic of metamorphic\r\nrocks. It is seen on hosts of the rocks about New York City, all over\r\nNew England, and in any other metamorphic region. Plate 63 is a\r\nphotograph of such a crumpled rock which has been smoothed by the\r\nglacial ice.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic rocks are the most difficult of all the rocks to\r\ndetermine and understand, because the amount of change through which\r\nthey have gone is greatest, but for this same reason they offer the most\r\ninterest, for the agents which caused the changes are of the most\r\ndramatic type of any that occur in Nature. From one place to another a\r\nsingle layer of metamorphic rock changes according to the greater or\r\nless heat to which it was subjected, making a series of related rocks of\r\nthe same composition but with varied amount of alteration. For this\r\nreason in naming metamorphic rocks, a type is named, and from that there\r\nwill be gradations in one or more directions, both according to\r\ncomposition, and according to amount of heat involved. If it is possible\r\nto follow a given layer of metamorphic rock from one place to another\r\nthis is of great interest; for by this means, many variations in the\r\ntype will be found, both those resulting from a different amount of\r\nheat, and those due to the local changes in the composition of the\r\noriginal rock.\r\n\r\nOne further consideration has to be kept in mind. When a rock is\r\nmetamorphosed the high temperatures either drive off all water, or the\r\nwater may be used up in the making of some of the complex minerals. When\r\nsuch a metamorphic rock later comes near the surface and is exposed to\r\nthe presence of ground water, and that leaching down from the surface\r\ninto the rocks, several of the minerals formed at high temperatures will\r\ntake up this water and make new minerals such as serpentine, chlorite,\r\netc. They are always associated with metamorphic rocks, and have been\r\nmetamorphic rocks, but since then have become hydrated, forming minerals\r\nnot at all characteristic of high temperature.\r\n\r\nThe following shows the relation of the sedimentary and igneous rocks to\r\ntheir metamorphic equivalents.\r\n\r\n    _Loose sediment_       _Consolidated sediment_          _Metamorphic\r\n                                                            equivalent_\r\n\r\n  gravel                conglomerate                    gneiss\r\n  sand (quartz)         sandstone                       quartzite\r\n  mud (sand and clay)   shale                           schist\r\n  clay                  shale                           slate or phyllite\r\n  marl                  limestone                       marble\r\n  peat                  bituminous coal                 anthracite to\r\n                                                        graphite\r\n                        coarse igneous rocks such as    gneiss\r\n                        granite, syenite, etc.\r\n                        fine igneous rocks such as      schist\r\n                        trachite, rhyolite, etc.\r\n\r\nIn working out the past history of any given region, much of it is done\r\non the basis of this series of equivalents. The finding of limestone,\r\nfor instance, indicates that the given area was at one time under the\r\nsea to a considerable depth, that is from 100 to 1000 feet, but not\r\nocean-bottom depths which run in tens of thousands of feet. Marble\r\nindicates the same thing, and so one can go on through all these types\r\nof rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nGneiss\r\nPl. 64\r\n\r\nGneiss is an old word used by the Saxon miners, and is often very\r\nloosely used. Here it is used in its structural sense, and a gneiss may\r\nbe defined as: a banded metamorphic rock, derived either from a\r\nsedimentary or an igneous rock, and is composed of feldspar, quartz, and\r\nmica or hornblende, and is coarse enough, so that the constituent\r\nminerals can be determined by the eye. It corresponds to a granite, or\r\nsome sedimentary rock like gravel or conglomerate.\r\n\r\nDue to the action of pressure, all the gneisses are banded, and the\r\noriginal constituent particles or crystals are distorted. The lines of\r\nbanding may be long or short, straight, curved or contorted. When the\r\nbanding is not conspicuous, the gneiss tends toward a granite. When the\r\nbanding is thin and the structure appears flaky, the gneiss tends toward\r\na schist. The color varies according to the constituent minerals, from\r\nnearly white, through red, gray, brown, or green to nearly black. Plate\r\n64 shows one gneiss which is in a less advanced stage, the pebbles being\r\nsimply flattened and the matrix partly altered to micaceous minerals,\r\nand a second gneiss which is so far advanced that the original\r\nconstituents are all altered to other minerals and only the banded\r\nstructure remains. This latter type would have required but little more\r\nheat to have completed the melting and changed this to a granite.\r\n\r\nGneisses are very compact and have little or no pore space in them. They\r\nare hard and strong and resist weathering well, so that they are widely\r\nused as building stone: but they are not as good as granite for this\r\npurpose, as they split more readily in one direction and can not\r\ntherefore be worked so uniformly as can granite.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of gneiss, based either on their origin,\r\ncomposition, or their structure, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Granite-gneiss is one derived by metamorphism from granite.\r\n  Syenite-gneiss is one derived by metamorphism from syenite.\r\n  Diorite-gneiss is one derived by metamorphism from diorite.\r\n  Gabbro-gneiss is one derived by metamorphism from gabbro.\r\n  Biotite-gneiss is one composed of quartz, feldspar and biotite.\r\n  Muscovite-gneiss is one composed of quartz, feldspar and muscovite.\r\n  Hornblende-gneiss is one composed of quartz, feldspar and hornblende.\r\n  Banded-gneiss is one in which the banded structure shows clearly.\r\n  Foliated-gneiss is one in which there is thin irregular layering.\r\n  Augen-gneiss is one which has concretionary lumps scattered through\r\n          it.\r\n\r\nGneisses have a wide distribution over all New England, most of Canada,\r\nthe Piedmont Plateau, the Lake Superior region, the Rocky Mountains, the\r\nSierra Nevada and the Cascade Ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuartzite\r\n\r\nQuartzite is metamorphosed sand or sandstone, and frequently grades into\r\none or the other. It is a hard compact crystalline rock, which breaks\r\nwith a splintery or conchoidal fracture. It is distinguished from\r\nsandstone by the almost complete lack of pore spaces, its greater\r\nhardness and by its crystalline structure. In practice it may be\r\ndistinguished by the fact that a sandstone in breaking separates between\r\nthe grains of sand, while a quartzite breaks through the grains.\r\n\r\nSome quartzites are almost pure quartz, but others contain impurities of\r\nclay, lime or iron, which were in the original sandstone. These alter in\r\nthe metamorphism to such accessory minerals as feldspar, mica, cyanite,\r\nmagnetite, hematite, calcite, graphite, etc. The color of quartzite when\r\npure is white, but may be altered to red, yellow, or green by the\r\npresence of these accessory minerals.\r\n\r\nOn account of the difficulty of working the quartzites, they are not\r\nmuch used in building, though they are very durable. When crushed they\r\noften make excellent road ballast, or filling for concrete work. The\r\npure varieties are sometimes ground and used in the manufacture of\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nAccording to the accessory mineral, the following varieties may be\r\ndistinguished; chloritic-quartzite, micaceous-quartzite,\r\nfeldspathic-quartzite, etc.\r\n\r\nQuartzites are common in the New England, the Piedmont Plateau, and Lake\r\nSuperior metamorphic regions, and also in many western localities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchist\r\nPl. 65\r\n\r\nSchist is a loosely used term, but is used here in its structural sense.\r\nIt includes those metamorphic rocks which are foliated or composed of\r\nthin scaly layers, all more or less alike. The principle minerals are\r\nrecognizable with the naked eye. In general schists lack feldspar, but\r\nthere are some special cases in which it may be present. Quartz is an\r\nabundant component of schists; and with it there will be one or more\r\nminerals of the following groups: mica, chlorite, talc, amphibole or\r\npyroxene. Frequently there are also accessory minerals present, like\r\ngarnet, staurolite, tourmaline, pyrite, magnetite, etc.\r\n\r\nAll schists have the schistose structure, and split in one direction\r\nwith a more or less smooth, though often irregular, surface. At right\r\nangles to this surface they break with greater or less difficulty and\r\nwith a frayed edge. As they get coarser, the schists may grade into\r\ngneisses, losing their scaly structure: while on the other side, as the\r\nconstituent minerals become finer and so small as to be difficult of\r\nrecognition, schists may grade into slates.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of schist are based on the mineral associated with the\r\nquartz; as mica-schist, chlorite-schist, hornblende-schist, talc-schist,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe color also is due to the constituent minerals other than quartz and\r\nranges widely, mica-schists being white to brown or nearly black,\r\nchlorite-schists some shade of green, hornblende-schists from dark green\r\nto black, talc-schists white, pale-green, yellowish or gray, etc.\r\n\r\nSchists are found all over the same regions as gneisses and quartzites,\r\n_i.e._, New England (especially good exposures of schist being seen\r\nabout New York City), the Lake Superior region, Rocky Mountains, etc.\r\nBeside these regions where it occurs native, there are boulders of\r\nschist all over the glaciated areas of eastern and northern United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlate\r\n\r\nSlate is a metamorphic rock which will split into thin or thick sheets,\r\nand is composed of grains so fine as to be indistinguishable to the\r\nunaided eye. The cleavage is the result of pressure during metamorphism,\r\nand has nothing to do with the bedding or stratification of the\r\nsedimentary rock from which it was derived. The original bedding planes\r\nmay appear as streaks, often more or less plicated, and running at any\r\nangle with the cleavage. If these bedding streaks are abundant or very\r\nmarked, they may make a slate unsuitable for commercial uses. The slaty\r\ncleavage may be very perfect and smooth so that the rock splits into\r\nfine sheets, in which case it is often used for roofing slate; but by\r\nfar the greater part of the slates have a cleavage which is not smooth\r\nor perfect enough so that they can be so used. Slates are the\r\nmetamorphic equivalents of shales and muds, and represent the effect of\r\ngreat pressure but with less heat than is associated with schists or\r\nphyllite, and consequently with less alteration of the original mineral\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nThe color ranges from gray through red, green and purple to black. The\r\ngrays and black are due to the presence of more or less carbonaceous\r\nmaterial in the original rock, the carbon compounds having changed to\r\ngraphite. The reds and purple are due to the presence of iron oxides,\r\nand the green to the presence of chlorite.\r\n\r\nWhile the particles of slate are so small as to be indistinguishable to\r\nthe unaided eye, the use of thin sections under the microscope shows\r\nthat slate is composed mostly of quartz and mica, with a wide range of\r\naccessory minerals, like chlorite, feldspar, magnetite, hematite,\r\npyrite, calcite, graphite, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to their chief constituents slates may be distinguished as\r\nargillaceous-slate or _argillite_, bituminous-slate, calcareous-slate,\r\nsiliceous-slate, etc.\r\n\r\nSlate will be found here and there in the metamorphic areas of New\r\nEngland, the Piedmont Plateau, the Lake Superior region, and in many\r\nplaces in the west.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhyllite\r\nPl. 66\r\n\r\nPhyllite is a thinly cleavable, finely micaceous rock of uniform\r\ncomposition, which is intermediate between slate and mica schist. In\r\nthis case the flakes of mica are large enough to be distinguishable to\r\nthe eye, but most of the rest of the material can only be identified\r\nwith the aid of a microscope. It is mostly quartz and sericite. Phyllite\r\nrepresents a degree of metamorphism greater than for slate, but less\r\nthan for schist; and it may grade into either of these other rocks.\r\nGarnets, pyrite, etc., may be present as accessory minerals. The color\r\nranges from nearly white to black, and it is likely to occur in the same\r\nplaces as do slates.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarble\r\nPl. 66\r\n\r\nThis is a broad term, and includes all those rocks composed essentially\r\nof calcium carbonate (limestones) or its mixture with magnesium\r\ncarbonate (dolomite), which are crystalline, or of granular structure,\r\nas a result of metamorphism. It takes less heat to metamorphose a\r\nlimestone, and for this reason the marbles have a more crystalline\r\nstructure than most metamorphic rocks; and they do not have the tendency\r\nto split or cleave which is so characteristic of most metamorphic rocks.\r\nIt is only when there is a large amount of mica present that the typical\r\nschistosity appears. Commercially the term marble is used to include\r\ntrue marble and also those limestones which will take a high polish; but\r\nin this book, and geologically speaking, no rock is a marble unless it\r\nhas crystalline structure.\r\n\r\nMarbles range widely in color according to their impurities. Pure marble\r\nis white. Carbonaceous material in the antecedent limestone is changed\r\nto graphite in the metamorphic process, and makes the marble black, but\r\nappears usually in streaks or spots, rather than in any uniform color.\r\nAn all black “marble” is usually a limestone. The presence of iron\r\ncolors the marble red or pink. Chlorite makes it green, etc.\r\n\r\nVarious accessory minerals are common in marbles, such as mica,\r\npyroxene, amphibole, grossularite among the garnets, magnetite, spinel,\r\npyrite, etc., through a long list.\r\n\r\nBecause it cuts readily in all directions and takes a high polish,\r\nmarble is widely used as a building stone. In the moist climate of the\r\nUnited States it suffers in being soluble in rain water when used on the\r\noutside of a building: but for interior decoration it furnishes some of\r\nthe finest effects.\r\n\r\nThe largest marble quarries are developed in Vermont, Massachusetts, New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Alabama, Colorado, California, and\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteatite\r\n_Soapstone_\r\n\r\nSteatite is a rock composed essentially of talc, which is associated\r\nwith more or less impurities, such as mica, tremolite, enstatite,\r\nquartz, magnetite, etc. It is found in and with metamorphic rocks, and\r\nis a rock which has been modified by hydration from a metamorphic\r\npredecessor. It was probably first a tremolite or enstatite schist, in\r\nwhich, after the metamorphic rock came into the zone where ground water\r\nexists, the tremolite or enstatite was altered to talc, the impurities\r\nremaining much as they were in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt is bluish-gray to green in color, often soft enough to cut with a\r\nknife, and has a greasy feel. It is very resistant to heat and acids;\r\nfor which reasons it has proved very useful commercially in making\r\nhearthstones, laundry tubs, and fire backs; and, when powdered, in\r\nmaking certain lubricants. The Indians, in the days before Columbus,\r\ntook advantage of the ease with which it is cut, to make from it large\r\npots for holding liquids, which are today among the greatest treasures\r\nin collections of Indian relics. They also carved pipe-bowls and various\r\nornaments and amulets from soapstone.\r\n\r\nIt is found in Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpentine\r\nPl. 67\r\n\r\nPure serpentine is the hydrated silicate of magnesium, as described\r\namong the minerals on page 138. Serpentine rock is serpentine with more\r\nor less impurities, such as pyroxene, amphibole, olivine, magnetite,\r\nchromite, calcite, magnesite, etc. It often also contains mica and such\r\ngarnets as pyrope, as accessory minerals. Serpentine, like steatite,\r\nalways occurs in and with metamorphic rocks, and was originally a\r\nmetamorphic rock, but has since been changed by the hydration of its\r\nsilicates, when it came into the zone in which ground water is present.\r\nIn the first instance it was some sort of shale, clay and dolomite,\r\nwhich was metamorphosed to an amphibole or pyroxene schist. When this\r\nwas exposed to the action of ground water, the amphibole or pyroxene\r\nminerals were changed to serpentine, resulting in a rock composed mostly\r\nof serpentine, but retaining the impurities which were in the\r\nmetamorphic rock, and perhaps adding to them such amphiboles and\r\npyroxenes as were not altered during the hydration process. The above is\r\nthe commonest type of serpentine rock. It can and sometimes has been\r\nformed in a similar way from an igneous predecessor, by the hydration of\r\nits silicate minerals. In this latter case the serpentine would not be a\r\nmodified metamorphic rock, but a modified igneous one. It is a case\r\nwhere such a rock as a diorite or a gabbro is exposed to ground water\r\nand the pyroxene present altered to serpentine. A serpentine formed in\r\nthis way would be a very impure one.\r\n\r\nSerpentine rock is used as an ornamental stone for interior decoration,\r\nbecause it takes a high polish and has pleasing colors, various shades\r\nof green. It is however decidedly soft and will stand very little\r\nexposure to weather, and it is also filled with seams which make it\r\ndifficult to get out large slabs.\r\n\r\nSerpentine rock occurs fairly commonly in the metamorphic belt of New\r\nEngland and the Piedmont Plateau, and in some of the western states,\r\nespecially California, Oregon, and Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nOphiolite\r\n_Ophicalcite_\r\n\r\nThis name is given to marbles which are streaked and spotted with\r\nserpentine. They are a mixture of green serpentine and a white or nearly\r\nwhite calcite, magnesite or dolomite in variable proportions.\r\n\r\nOphicalcite occurs in and with metamorphic rocks, and represents an\r\nimpure limestone which has been metamorphised, the lime becoming marble,\r\nand the impurities becoming such silicates as pyroxene, amphibole, or\r\nolivine. This metamorphic rock has then come into the zone of\r\nground-water and the silicate minerals have been changed by hydration to\r\nserpentine. Ophicalcite is then a metamorphic rock, in which secondary\r\nchemical changes have since taken place. It may have a wide range of\r\naccessory minerals present, such as magnetite, chromite, pyrope among\r\nthe garnets, olivine, etc. Verde antique is a trade name for one of the\r\nophiolites.\r\n\r\nWhile not abundant, ophicalcite is in good demand as an ornamental stone\r\nfor interior work; for it takes a high polish, and is beautiful; but, on\r\nthe other hand, it will not stand exposure to the weather for the\r\ncalcite is soluble, and there are numerous seams and cracks in it making\r\nit difficult to obtain large slabs.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in Quebec, Canada, in the Green Mountains of Vermont, and in\r\nthe Adirondack Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                          MISCELLANEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few rocks which do not fit into any of the three groups\r\ndescribed, such as concretions, geodes, meteorites, etc., and they are\r\ngathered together here. There is also one type of rock, which really\r\nbelongs among the minerals, but is likely not to be so recognized at\r\nfirst glance, and that is the material filling veins. These last are\r\nsometimes designated “vein rocks,” but are really massive deposits of\r\none, two or more minerals, and should be referred to the minerals when\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Concretions\r\n\r\nIn the sedimentary rocks there frequently occur inclusions of a nature\r\ndifferent from the surrounding rock. In shape they are usually rounded,\r\nnodular, spherical, discoidal, ovate, flattened, elongated or\r\nring-shaped, or combinations of the foregoing, making often curious and\r\nfantastic forms. In size they range from a fraction of an inch in\r\ndiameter to several feet through. When broken, they may show a nucleus,\r\naround which more or less concentric layers have formed, or neither\r\nnucleus nor concentric structure may be visible. The layered structure\r\nof the surrounding rock in some cases continues right through the\r\nnodular mass. These structures are called concretions, and their\r\nformation in all cases is at least due to similar reactions.\r\n\r\nIn general the concretions differ from the surrounding rock in\r\ncomposition, but are usually composed of some one of its impurities, of\r\nlime in the clays or silica in limestones, of iron oxide in sandstone,\r\netc. They seem to have originated as a result of the solution of the\r\nminor mineral, and then its redeposition around some center or nucleus.\r\nIn many cases the nucleus is organic, such as a leaf, a shell, a bone,\r\netc., so that when the concretion is split, in its center will be found\r\nthe perfect imprint of the leaf, or the shell of a mollusk, or a bone of\r\na higher animal, sometimes a whole skeleton. Again the nucleus may be\r\ninorganic like a grain of sand; and in still other cases no nucleus can\r\nbe found, though there was probably one in the beginning. What has\r\nhappened is somewhat like the case of accessory minerals in igneous and\r\nmetamorphic rocks. A layer of sediment was laid down, including in it,\r\nhere and there, something foreign to the run of the rock. Later when the\r\nwater leaches through this rock, impregnated with lime for instance, it\r\ncomes to the point where a leaf is decomposing. The products of the leaf\r\ndecomposition are different from what is already present in solution,\r\nand may precipitate some of the lime in that neighborhood. As long as\r\nleaf decomposition continues the precipitation in that region will\r\ncontinue and increase the size of the concretion. This sort of action\r\naccounts for many of the concretions, especially those about organic\r\nremains. In some other cases where there is no nucleus, as the flint in\r\nchalk, what has taken place is that the small amounts of silica in the\r\nlime have been dissolved, and then around some center has constantly\r\nbeen added more and more non-crystalline silica until a mass of flint\r\nhas accumulated. There may be a considerable variety of ways to account\r\nfor different concretions, but in all cases solutions of one mineral\r\nhave come in contact with solutions of a different kind, and\r\nprecipitation about a center has resulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nClay stones\r\nPl. 68\r\n\r\nOf all the concretions these are perhaps the commonest, being found in\r\nthe clays of all types and in many regions. They are made of lime and\r\nprecipitated around some nucleus of foreign matter. The shapes vary\r\nwidely, usually discs, flattened ovals or even rings, in most all cases\r\nhowever flattened. This is indicative of the water moving though the\r\nclay more freely in some layers than others. Often clay stones occur so\r\nabundantly that two or more have grown together making fantastic shapes,\r\nsometimes resembling animals, and all sorts of fancied but unrelated\r\nobjects. As the clay stones have grown the clay has not been pushed\r\naside, but has been incorporated within the concretion; so that when a\r\nconcretion is dissolved in acid, it yields not only the lime, which is\r\nits reason for being, but also a large amount of clay.\r\n\r\nClaystones are found in clays most anywhere, usually occurring in\r\ncertain layers and being absent from others.\r\n\r\n\r\nLime concretions\r\n\r\nThese are found mostly in shales which carry a high percentage of clay\r\nas impurities, and are characteristic of the older geological\r\nformations, especially ancient sea bottoms. They are likely to have as a\r\nnucleus some shell, fish bone, or a leaf, which when the concretion is\r\nsplit, reveals a wonderfully preserved portion of an animal or a plant,\r\nwhich was buried millions of years ago. The lime concretion is closely\r\nrelated to the claystone, and is really a claystone which has been\r\nburied so long that the surrounding matrix has changed to a shale\r\ninstead of remaining clay.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous localities for these lime concretions is Mazon\r\nCreek, Illinois, where thousands of these concretions have been picked\r\nup and split to study the organic remains included. The commonest\r\nobjects found are fern leaves, like the one on Plate 68. But about once\r\nin a thousand times they inclose a spider or insect, and once in ten\r\nthousand times the skeleton of an amphibian, which is of especial\r\ninterest, as here have been thus found the remains of the very earliest\r\nof the land animals. These remains were inclosed in these concretions\r\nduring the coal age, probably 50,000,000 years ago, and once inclosed\r\nall the hard parts have been as well preserved after that long interval,\r\nas they were immediately after being inclosed in the concretion. Lime\r\nconcretions range from less than an inch in diameter to several feet\r\nthrough. They are not confined to shales, but sometimes occur in\r\nsandstones, in this case also usually having as a nucleus either a\r\nshell, or the bone, or bones, of some animal.\r\n\r\nThey are likely to be found anywhere in the limestone belt, from the\r\nAppalachian Mountains to the Rocky Mountains, or in the Great Basin, or\r\non the Pacific Coast. Often they have been mistaken for turtles and\r\nother objects. A good many of the cases where the head or body of\r\nanimals “petrified with all the flesh” are reported, it is one of these\r\nconcretions which has a shape sufficiently like the part described, for\r\nthe imagination to construct the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSepteria\r\nPl. 69\r\n\r\nSepteria are lime concretions, which, after they had formed, have shrunk\r\nand developed a series of cracks running through them in all sorts of\r\ndirections, and since then the cracks have been filled with various\r\nminerals, such as calcite, dolomite, and siderite. These make a series\r\nof veins which intersect the concretion, in a sort of network. Septeria\r\nare mostly of considerable size, ranging from six inches in diameter to\r\nseveral feet through. They are characteristic of the shales of ancient\r\nsea bottoms, especially those of Devonian age in New York, and\r\nPennsylvania, and those of Cretaceous age in Wyoming, Montana and the\r\nDakotas.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlint concretions\r\n\r\nThe silica in limestones is often segregated into nodular masses of\r\nvarying sizes, to make concretions of flint. Such masses have grown in\r\nthe limestone, and, while growing, have either pushed away, or dissolved\r\nthe adjacent limestone, so that the flint nodule is pure silica. They\r\nare especially characteristic of the chalk beds, and of ancient\r\nlimestones which formed on the floor of the sea, like the Helderberg\r\nLimestone of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, etc. When thin sections are\r\ncut through these flints, and examined under the microscope, many\r\nremnants of the shells of plants and animals are still recognizable. A\r\nnucleus is seldom found, but in some cases there is a fossil in the\r\nnodule about which the concretion doubtless formed. The spicules of\r\nsponges, shells of diatoms, and of radiolarians seem to have contributed\r\nmost of the material from which flint concretions are formed. In\r\naddition to the silica there are frequently inclosed in these nodules\r\nthe horny jaws of various sea worms, and a host of spiny balls the\r\nrelationships of which are still unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSandstone concretions\r\n\r\nThere are two types of sandstone concretions, first those which are\r\ncemented with lime, and second those cemented with iron oxide. The\r\nconcretions bound by lime are especially characteristic of sandstones\r\nwhich were laid down as river deposits, either in the channels or on the\r\nflood plains, and also the sandy deposits resulting from wind\r\ndeposition. In these cases the concretions will mostly be found to have\r\nformed around some organic nucleus, most frequently about a bone, or\r\ngroup of bones, of some ancient animal. In this country they are mostly\r\nfound in the arid and semiarid sections of the West, where the present\r\nday wind erosion exposes the harder parts of bluffs, etc.\r\n\r\nThe second type of sandstone concretion is the one in which the cement\r\nis most often limonite, less often hematite. These concretions are less\r\ndense than the lime ones, and in some cases the limonite is only\r\nprecipitated at a distance from the nucleus, which has resulted in the\r\nformation of a hollow shell, filled with loose sand. This is especially\r\ncharacteristic of certain concretions, found in a gravel or coarse sand\r\nin the region of Middletown, Del.\r\n\r\n\r\nOolites\r\n\r\nIn large bodies of water like the sea and some larger lakes we find\r\nconcretions which have formed, or are still forming, about tiny grains\r\nof sand, which are still being moved about by the waves and currents. In\r\nsuch cases not only are great masses of concretions formed but they have\r\nvery clearly marked the concentric layering, which shows that they have\r\nincreased in size, sometimes more rapidly and sometimes more slowly.\r\nWhere great masses of such concretions have formed the resulting rock\r\nappears like a great mass of small eggs, whence the term oolite. The\r\ncement may be any one of several substances, but lime, silica, and\r\nhematite are perhaps the most common. Here and there are found larger or\r\nsmaller masses of this oolite. In some cases it would appear that the\r\nmaterial was precipitated by the action of bacteria. Such for instance\r\nis probably the origin of the Clinton iron ore, a bed of oolitic\r\nhematite, extending from New York State all down the Appalachian\r\nMountains to Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\nPisolite\r\nPl. 69\r\n\r\nWhen the concretions, formed in exactly the same manner as in the case\r\nof oolite, are of a size bigger than a pea, then the rock is known as\r\npisolite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Other Concretions\r\n\r\nThough less abundant concretion may form from still other substances.\r\nHematite has been mentioned, and when concretions are made of this\r\nmaterial, either they have been deposited by bacteria, or were formed as\r\nlimonite and the water of crystallization of this latter mineral driven\r\noff.\r\n\r\nManganese concretions are found on the floor of the ocean at maximum\r\ndepths, and brought to the surface by dredging.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Geodes\r\n\r\nGeodes are nodules, which, when broken open, are found to be hollow and\r\nthe cavity lined with one or more minerals. They represent a special\r\ncase of minerals in a cave. There was in the first place a cavity in the\r\nsurrounding rock, usually of sand or clay. As the water leached through\r\nthe surrounding rock, it became saturated with one or more minerals and\r\nthen coming into the cavity, deposited the minerals, either as crystals,\r\nor as a non-crystalline mass, lining the cavity. Thus the inside is\r\noften a beautiful cluster of bristling crystals, or it may be simply\r\nlayer on layer of chalcedony of any color. Before this process had gone\r\nso far as to completely fill the cavity, erosion had dislodged the mass,\r\nand it has been found. One usually recognizes that it is a geode by the\r\nfact that it is far too light to be a solid rock, and then it may be\r\ncarefully broken. They are characteristic of certain formations; so that\r\nhaving accidentally broken the first one, others can be carefully opened\r\nto display the beauty of the interior. The geode illustrated on Plate 70\r\nis lined with quartz crystals, but near by were found many others, some\r\nof which had chalcedony and some jasper as a lining. Such crystallined\r\nnodules are usually called geodes so long as they occur in a softer\r\nmatrix so that they are easily dislodged, and until they reach a size of\r\nthree or four feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Pebbles\r\n\r\nWhen picked up either from brook beds, sea beaches, or the open plain,\r\nthere are few forms of rock which tell a story of the past more\r\ncompletely than do pebbles; and any one, who enjoys reading a story\r\nwritten in form, structure and composition, will find in pebbles one of\r\nthe most satisfying and at the same time testing exercises. The story\r\nmay be complex or simple according to what has happened to the parent\r\nrock, and to that is added what happened since the pebble left the ledge\r\nwhere it was a part of a great mass. One must not forget to take into\r\nconsideration where the pebble was found and the character of its\r\nassociates. This sort of exercise is recommended to all interested in\r\nrocks. It will yield something upon first trying, and more on prolonged\r\nstudy; and the fullness with which it is done will test one’s knowledge\r\nof the meaning of rocks as nothing else will do. As a sample of this\r\nsort of exercise let us take the two pebbles illustrated on Plate 71.\r\n\r\nThe upper one is a common quartz pebble picked up in a New England brook\r\nbed. Such pebbles are common all over the country formerly covered by\r\nthe glacial ice sheet. It is crystalline quartz, but the individual\r\ncrystals are not distinguishable, and such quartz is typical as the\r\nfilling of veins. It therefore goes back to a time when the rocks were\r\nfissured, probably in connection with the folding accompanying mountain\r\nmaking far to the north in Canada. Into the fissures thus formed seeped\r\nthe water which had been leaching through the adjacent rocks, and it was\r\nsaturated with silica which it had dissolved from those rocks. In the\r\nopen fissure the quartz was deposited as crystals, which grew finally\r\nfilling the fissure and crowding each other so that all the faces were\r\nobliterated. The quartz vein was complete, but it must have been far\r\nbelow the surface of the ground. Time must have passed, thousands of\r\nyears of it, until, in the weathering away of the mountain system, the\r\nmany feet of overlying rock were removed and this vein was brought to\r\nthe surface. As the quartz is harder than the adjacent rocks, the vein\r\nsoon projected as a ledge. The effect of changes of temperature in\r\nalternately expanding and contracting the rocks developed cracks, into\r\nwhich water worked its way, and then the breaking was hastened by the\r\nexpansion which takes place when water freezes, and in exposed regions\r\nis so effective, because the freezing and thawing are so often repeated.\r\nFinally an angular fragment of quartz was dislodged and lay on the\r\nsurface, resistant to the solvent power of the rain. In this case this\r\nhappened just before the advance of the great ice sheet. When that came\r\nto the place where the fragment lay, it was picked up along with all\r\nother loose material and partly shoved in front of, but probably mostly\r\ncarried frozen in the ice, and journeyed one, two, three hundred,\r\nperhaps a thousand miles. This took many years for the ice moved only a\r\nfew feet a day. Finally however it came to the point where the ice\r\nmelted as fast as it advanced, and our quartz fragment was dropped at\r\nthe front of the ice sheet along with other great masses of till. Here\r\nthere was abundant water, partly from the melting of the ice, and partly\r\nfrom the storms which must develop where there are such contrasts in\r\ntemperature, as there would be over the ice, on one hand, and over the\r\nbare land in front of the ice on the other hand. A torrent picked up our\r\nfragment and started it on a second journey, banging against other\r\nstones as it rolled along down the stream bed, every time it struck\r\nanother stone bruising the corners which soon became rounded. Thus from\r\ntime to time during high water the quartz fragment, becoming rounder\r\nevery time it moved, journeyed down stream, until it came to the point\r\nwhere the stream emptied into a lake. Here the current was checked and\r\nthe stone dropped to the bottom along with other larger stones to make\r\nthe delta at the mouth of the stream. There it lay as long as the lake\r\nexisted, and would be lying now, but that in New England a tilting\r\nmovement of the land tipped the north end of the lake up and the water\r\nall ran out. Then the stream began to flow over its own delta and in\r\ntime of freshet tore a channel down through the old delta carrying the\r\npebble still further down, until it came to the level stretch which\r\nrepresented the old lake’s bottom and there it dropped the pebble in its\r\nbed. And there it was found and picked up to become the pebble which\r\ntold the above story of its life, and to repeat it as often as anyone\r\nwill look at it with a seeing eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second pebble is quite a different one. It was picked up in a gravel\r\nbank along a railroad cut, just at the foot of Mt. Toby in\r\nMassachussetts, and the writer has used it many times to test his\r\nstudents, to see if they could read the story which it tells.\r\n\r\nIt consists of two sorts of rock, the one, angular fragments of a\r\nhornblende schist, the other, a fine-grained granite filling all the\r\nspaces between the fragments of schist, even in cracks less than a\r\nquarter of an inch wide. The schist is the older rock and in its first\r\nappearance represents a deposit of mud (clay and sand) on the floor of\r\nthe ocean, well out from the shore, and somewhere off to the east of Mt.\r\nToby, perhaps ten miles, perhaps more, from the place where it was\r\nfound. This was back in early Palæozoic times, millions of years ago.\r\n\r\nThis deposit was buried by further layers of sediment on the sea bottom\r\nand cemented into a shale. Then during a mountain making period the\r\nregion was folded, and the sediments were altered by the combined\r\npressure and heat, our layer of rock becoming a hornblende schist. After\r\nthat happened considerable time must have passed, but just how much is\r\nnot indicated by the pebble, before another period of disturbance took\r\nplace, during which this deep seated schist was faulted, and shattered\r\nto fragments along the line of breaking. This accounts for the angular\r\nfragments. Then into the fissure thus formed was pressed a molten magma,\r\nwhich while liquid enough to flow and be squeezed into every opening\r\ncould not have been very hot; for not even the corners of the schist\r\nfragments are melted or altered, so as to appear any different from the\r\nmass of the schist. The molten magma cooled rather slowly, making a\r\nfine-grained granite. This must all have taken place far below the\r\nsurface, or the magma would have cooled into a felsite or dense lava.\r\n\r\nAgain a long time must have elapsed, while the rock overlying our piece\r\nwas eroded away, so it could come to the surface. Just about the time it\r\ndid come to the surface, the Connecticut Valley was formed by a great\r\nblock, 95 miles long by fifteen to twenty miles wide, dropping down six\r\nor eight thousand feet (probably not all at once but by one or two\r\nhundred feet at a time) between two north and south faults. This took\r\nplace in the Triassic Period. Of course the streams then began to wash\r\nsand and stones of all sizes into the hole. Our pebble was one of these.\r\nWhile still an angular fragment, lying perhaps ten miles east of the\r\nConnecticut Valley, a stream started it moving, and as it rolled along\r\nthe brook bed, it was battered and rounded to its present shape, and\r\nfinally tumbled over a waterfall to the bottom of the great hole, which\r\nhad been formed as described above. Here with other stones it formed\r\npart of a coarse gravel, coarsest near the sides of the hole, and finer\r\ntoward the middle; for the material was further distributed in the\r\nbottom of the valley. Our stone stayed pretty near the side and was soon\r\nburied beneath hundreds of feet of similar material. The leaching water\r\ndissolved enough iron rust so that this acted on the lower layers as a\r\ncement and bound the whole mass into a conglomerate.\r\n\r\nHere for some millions of years our pebble rested, while above it was\r\npiled sand and gravel and a couple of sheets of lava, until the hole was\r\nfilled, and our pebble was near the bottom of the mass. Later movements\r\nof the land raised the whole region, fully six thousand feet, and\r\nerosion went on for other millions of years. The conglomerate and\r\nsandstone wore away faster than the metamorphosed rocks on either side\r\nof the filled valley, so that a new valley, the present Connecticut\r\nValley, came into existence.\r\n\r\nWhen our pebble finally came near to the surface on the side of Mt. Toby\r\n(a mound of conglomerate which somehow was protected and wore down a\r\nlittle less rapidly than the conglomerate on either side of it), it was\r\njust about the time of the glacial period. The great ice sheet went over\r\nthe mountain removing all the loose material and some more of the solid\r\nconglomerate. This brought our pebble to the surface, but too late to be\r\nmoved by the ice. However as soon as the ice left the Mt. Toby region,\r\nthe rains fell, and in the further weathering of the conglomerate, the\r\ncement holding our pebble in place was dissolved and it was freed. At\r\nonce a tiny brook started it rolling down the side of the mountain, a\r\nbrook so small that when the pebble reached the foot of the slope it did\r\nnot have power to carry it further. Here there gathered a fan-shaped\r\nmound of such pebbles, known as an alluvial fan. It rested here not over\r\na couple of thousand years, when the Central Vermont R. R. cut a groove\r\nthrough the fan, using the material for ballast, and here the pebble was\r\nfound and brought home.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Meteorites\r\n\r\nMeteorites can hardly be called common, but there is always a chance of\r\nfinding one, and their interest is so great, that none should escape\r\nbecause unrecognized.\r\n\r\nMeteorites are visitors to the earth from space, and they bring to us\r\nknowledge of the composition of planets and solar systems, other than\r\nour own. It is of interest to note, that while they have brought to us\r\nsome combinations of elements which do not occur in the earth, still\r\nthey have not brought any element with which we were not already\r\nfamiliar. They are popularly known as “falling” or “shooting stars,”\r\nthough of course they are not stars, but only small masses of matter\r\nwhich are entirely invisible until they come inside our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn space there are many small (compared with the size of the earth)\r\nchunks of matter, each pursuing its solitary way around the sun, or\r\nwandering through space along paths entirely unrelated to the sun. From\r\ntime to time one of these passes near enough to the earth, so as to be\r\ninfluenced by its attraction, and then comes rushing toward it at\r\ntremendous speed, 20 to 30 miles per second. As soon as it comes into\r\nthe atmosphere, even the very attenuated atmosphere, a couple of hundred\r\nmiles above the surface, friction heats the surface of the meteor until\r\nit glows, and by that light we see the so-called shooting star, often\r\nwith a trail of luminous matter streaming out behind. Of course in using\r\nthis term “shooting star,” we understand the meteor is no star, for they\r\nare bodies as big as our sun, shining at distances billions of miles\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAs the meteor rushes through the atmosphere it may all burn up, no large\r\nfragment reaching the earth’s surface. The luminous matter streaming out\r\nbehind is material which has melted and dripped off the main mass. As\r\nthis oxidizes and cools, that part which did not become gaseous will\r\nfinally fall to the earth as fine dust. When however a meteor actually\r\nfalls to the earth, its surface is still hot, though probably there has\r\nnot been time enough for much heat to be transmitted to the interior. At\r\nany rate they do not show any alteration due to this cause. On landing\r\nand sometimes before they land meteors break into two or more pieces.\r\nWhen found the surface always shows the effects of the heat generated by\r\nthe friction of passing through the air, the surface being smoothed, and\r\ncovered with stream lines and melted out pits and hollows, and the outer\r\nsurface consisting of a thin crust, making an appearance, which once\r\nseen, can hardly be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of meteorites, those made wholly or largely of iron\r\nwith some nickel, and appearing like great chunks of iron, and those\r\nwhich are stony and resemble a granite boulder. In collections the first\r\nsort, _i.e._ iron meteorites, are most abundantly represented, because\r\nmost easily recognized when found. They consist of masses of iron and\r\nnickel with small amounts of other elements, ranging in size from the\r\nCape York meteorite, which fell in northern Greenland in 1894 and was\r\nlater brought by Peary to the American Museum, and weighs some 36 tons,\r\ndown to small grains as small as a grain of wheat. The largest one which\r\nhas fallen in the United States was the Willamette meteorite weighing\r\nsome 15 tons, and falling 19 miles south of Portland, Oregon. These and\r\nall iron meteorites have the iron in crystalline form which is readily\r\nseen if the meteorite is cut, and the surface thus made polished, then\r\netched with acid, which is put on and quickly washed off. Every\r\nmeteorite has its particular pattern, as illustrated on Plate 72, and by\r\nthese patterns can be identified. Meteorites have a high value and are\r\neagerly sought by certain large institutions and collectors. Since the\r\ncrystalline structure is so characteristic of each fall, when a new\r\nmeteorite is found, it is usually cut in two, and one part retained by\r\nthe finder or some institution; while the other part is cut into small\r\npieces, an inch or two on a side and a quarter of an inch thick, but\r\neach large enough to show the characteristic pattern. These are\r\ndistributed largely by sale to other collectors. Thus a great meteorite\r\ncollection consists of a few large meteorites and a great many small\r\nportions of other meteorites.\r\n\r\nThe second type of meteorite is the stony meteorite. Where meteorites\r\nhave been located as they fell and recovered, the majority of them were\r\nof this type, so that probably more than half of the meteorites which\r\nfall are of the stony type. However when the stony meteorite is exposed\r\nto weathering it takes only a very short time before the surface is\r\neroded off and then such a meteorite looks like any other boulder and\r\nprobably most of them fail to be recognized, and so have been lost.\r\nBecause they have so much greater variety, they are in many ways of\r\ngreater interest than the iron type.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that every one have his eye out for meteorites, and when\r\nfound it is desirable that the fact should be reported to some one of\r\nthe great institutions which collect them, such as the National Museum\r\nin Washington, or the American Museum in New York. Each one should be on\r\nrecord even if it is desired to keep it in a private collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Fossils\r\n\r\nIn the sedimentary rocks one is apt to find remains of some of the\r\nanimals and plants that lived at the time the rock was forming. While\r\nthe soft parts of animals decompose rapidly, shells and bones are likely\r\nto be buried in the sediments, and if the conditions have been\r\nfavorable, these remains may be preserved more or less perfectly. All\r\nthrough the millions of years that sedimentary rocks have been forming\r\nin the sea, in lakes, on river flood plains and in wind swept deserts,\r\nthere was an abundance of life, as much as there is today; and our\r\nknowledge of that life is derived from these buried fossil remains, so\r\nthat fossils have a great historic interest.\r\n\r\nHowever as there have lived and died several times as many different\r\nkinds of animals as live today, the study of fossils becomes a separate\r\nsubject, which cannot be treated in this book. Should any collector of\r\nrocks and minerals come upon fossils, he is opening a new field, and it\r\nwill be necessary to turn to other sources for their identification.\r\nGeneral books on this subject are scarce, but one or two are given in\r\nthe literature list.\r\n\r\n\r\n   A List of the Elements, the Abbreviations Used for Them, and Their\r\n Atomic Weight, Which Is Approximately the
