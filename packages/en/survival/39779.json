A Yearling Graft      91\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little book has grown out of an attempt to teach the principles and\r\nmethods of grape training to college students. I have found such\r\nteaching to be exceedingly difficult and unsatisfactory. It is\r\nimpossible to firmly impress the lessons by mere lectures. The student\r\nmust apprehend the principles slowly and by his own effort. He must have\r\ntime to thoroughly assimilate them before he attempts to apply them. I\r\ntherefore cast about for books which I could put before my class, but I\r\nat once found that there are very few succinct accounts of the subjects\r\nof grape pruning and training, and that none of our books portray the\r\nmethods which are most largely practised in the large grape regions of\r\nthe east. My only recourse, therefore, was to put my own notes into\r\nshape for print, and this I have now done. And inasmuch as all\r\ngrape-growers are students, I hope that the simple account will find a\r\nuse beyond the classroom.\r\n\r\nThis lack of adequate accounts of grape training at first astonished me,\r\nbut is not strange after all. It must be remembered that the cultivation\r\nof the native grape is of very recent origin. There are many men who can\r\nremember its beginning in a commercial way. It seldom occurs to the\r\nyounger generation, which is familiar with the great vineyards in many\r\nstates, that the Concord is yet scarcely forty years old, and that all\r\ngrape growing in eastern America is yet in an experimental stage.\r\nProgress has been so rapid in recent years that the new methods outstrip\r\nthe books. The old horizontal arm spur system, which is still the chief\r\nmethod in the books, has evolved itself into a high renewal training,\r\nwhich is widely used but which has not found its way into the manuals.\r\nThe Kniffin type has outgrown its long period of incubation, and is now\r\ntaking an assured place in vineyard management. So two great types,\r\nopposed in method, are now contending for supremacy, and they will\r\nprobably form the basis of all future developments. This evolution of\r\nAmerican grape training is one of the most unique and signal\r\ndevelopments of our modern horticulture, and its very recent departure\r\nfrom the early doubts and trials is a fresh illustration of the youth\r\nand virility of all horticultural pursuits in North America.\r\n\r\nThis development of our grape training should form the subject of a\r\nhistorical inquiry. I have not attempted such in this little hand-book.\r\nI have omitted all reference to the many early methods, which were in\r\nmost cases transportations or modifications of European practices, for\r\ntheir value is now chiefly historical and their insertion here would\r\nonly confuse the reader. I have attempted nothing more than a plain\r\naccount of the methods now in use; in fact, I am aware that I have not\r\naccomplished even this much, for there are various methods which I have\r\nnot mentioned. But these omitted forms are mostly of local use or\r\nadaptation, and they are usually only modifications of the main types\r\nhere explained. It is impossible to describe all the variations in grape\r\ntraining in a book of pocket size; neither is it necessary. Nearly\r\nevery grower who has given grape raising careful attention has\r\nintroduced into his own vineyard some modifications which he thinks are\r\nof special value to him. There are various curious and instructive old\r\nbooks to which the reader can go if he desires to know the history and\r\nevolution of grape training in America. He will find that we have now\r\npassed through the long and costly experiment with European systems. And\r\nwe have also outgrown the gross or long-wood styles, and now prune close\r\nwith the expectation of obtaining superior and definite results.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to rely upon my own resources in the preparation of\r\nthis book. All the manuscript has been read by three persons--by George\r\nC. Snow, Penn Yan, N. Y., William D. Barns, Middle Hope, N. Y., and L.\r\nC. Corbett, my assistant in the Cornell Experiment Station. Mr. Snow is\r\na grower in the lake region of western New York, and employs the High\r\nRenewal system; Mr. Barns is a grower in the Hudson River valley, and\r\npractices the Kniffin system; while Mr. Corbett has been a student of\r\nall the systems and has practiced two or three of them in commercial\r\nplantations. These persons have made many suggestions of which I have\r\nbeen glad to avail myself, and to them very much of the value of the\r\nbook is to be attributed.\r\n\r\n     L. H. BAILEY,\r\n\r\n     ITHACA, N. Y., _Feb. 1, 1893_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Adlum, of the District of Columbia, appears to have been the first\r\nperson to systematically undertake the cultivation and amelioration of\r\nthe native grapes. His method of training, as described in 1823, is as\r\nfollows: One shoot is allowed to grow the first year, and this is cut\r\nback to two buds the first fall. The second year two shoots are allowed\r\nto grow, and they are tied to \"two stakes fixed down to the side of each\r\nplant, about five or six feet high;\" in the fall each cane is cut back\r\nto three or four buds. In the third spring, these two short canes are\r\nspread apart \"so as to make an angle of about forty-five degrees with\r\nthe stem,\" and are tied to stakes; this season about two shoots are\r\nallowed to grow from each branch, making four in all, and in the fall\r\nthe outside ones are cut back to three or four buds and the inner ones\r\nto two. These outside shoots are to bear the fruit the fourth year, and\r\nthe inside ones give rise to renewal canes. These two outer canes or\r\nbranches are secured to two stakes set about sixteen inches upon either\r\nside of the vine, and the shoots are tied up to the stakes, as they\r\ngrow. The renewal shoots from the inside stubs are tied to a third stake\r\nset near the root of the vine. The outside branches are to be cut away\r\nentirely at the end of the fourth year. This is an ingenious renewal\r\npost system, and it is easy to see how the Horizontal Arm and High\r\nRenewal systems may have sprung from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN GRAPE TRAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION--PRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning and training the grape are perplexed questions, even to those\r\nwho have spent a lifetime in grape growing. The perplexity arises from\r\nseveral diverse sources, as the early effort to transplant European\r\nmethods, the fact that many systems present almost equally good results\r\nfor particular purposes and varieties, and the failure to comprehend the\r\nfundamental principles of the operations.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient condemnation of European methods when applied in\r\neastern America, to say that the American grapes are distinct species\r\nfrom the European grapes, and that they are consequently different in\r\nhabit. This fact does not appear to have been apprehended clearly by the\r\nearly American grape-growers, even after the native varieties had begun\r\nto gain prominence. American viticulture, aside from that upon the\r\nPacific slope which is concerned with the European grape, is an industry\r\nof very recent development. It was little more than a century ago that\r\nthe first American variety gained favor, and so late as 1823 that the\r\nfirst definite attempt was made, in Adlum's \"Memoir on the Cultivation\r\nof the Vine in America,\" to record the merits of native grapes for\r\npurposes of cultivation. Even Adlum's book was largely given to a\r\ndiscussion of European varieties and practices. In 1846 \"Thomas' Fruit\r\nCulturist\" mentioned only six \"American hardy varieties,\" and all of\r\nthese, save the Catawba, are practically not in cultivation at the\r\npresent time. The Concord appeared in 1853. American grape training is,\r\ntherefore, a very recent development, and we are only now outgrowing the\r\ninfluence of the practices early imported from Europe. The first decided\r\nepoch in the evolution of our grape training was the appearance of\r\nFuller's \"Grape Culturist,\" in 1864; for while the system which he\r\ndepicted and which yet often bears his name, was but a modification of\r\nsome European methods and had been outlined by earlier American writers,\r\nit was at that time placed clearly and cogently before the public and\r\nbecame an accepted practice. The fundamental principles of pruning are\r\nalike for both European and American grapes, but the details of pruning\r\nand training must be greatly modified for different species. We must\r\nunderstand at the outset that American species of grapes demand an\r\nAmerican system of treatment.\r\n\r\nThe great diversity of opinion which exists amongst the best grape\r\ngrowers concerning the advantages of different systems of training is\r\nproof that many systems have merit, and that no one system is better\r\nthan others for all purposes. The grower must recognize the fact that\r\nthe most important factor in determining the merits of any system of\r\ntraining is the habit of the vine--as its vigor, rate of growth, normal\r\nsize, relative size and abundance of leaves, and season and character of\r\nfruit. Nearly every variety differs from others in habit in some\r\nparticular, and it therefore requires different treatment in some\r\nimportant detail. Varieties may thrive equally well upon the same\r\ngeneral system of training, but require minor modifications; so it comes\r\nthat no hard and fast lines can be laid down, either for any system or\r\nany variety. One system differs from another in some one main principle\r\nor idea, but the modifications of all may meet and blend. If two men\r\npractice the Kniffin system, therefore, this fact does not indicate that\r\nthey prune and train their vines exactly alike. It is impossible to\r\nconstruct rules for grape training; it is, therefore, important that we\r\nunderstand thoroughly the philosophy of pruning and training, both in\r\ngeneral and in the different systems which are now most popular. These\r\npoints we shall now consider.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING.\r\n\r\nPruning and training are terms which are often confounded when speaking\r\nof the grape, but they represent distinct operations. Pruning refers to\r\nsuch removal of branches as shall insure better and larger fruit upon\r\nthe remaining portions. Training refers to the disposition of the\r\ndifferent parts of the vine. It is true that different methods of\r\ntraining demand different styles of pruning, but the modification in\r\npruning is only such as shall adapt it to the external shape and size of\r\nthe vine, and does not in any way affect the principle upon which it\r\nrests. Pruning is a necessity, and, in essence, there is but one method;\r\ntraining is largely a convenience, and there are as many methods as\r\nthere are fancies among grape growers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. GRAPE SHOOT.]\r\n\r\nAll intelligent pruning of the grape rests upon the fact that _the fruit\r\nis borne in a few clusters near the base of the growing shoots of the\r\nseason, and which spring from wood of last year's growth_. It may be\r\nsaid here that a growing, leafy branch of the grape vine is called a\r\n_shoot_; a ripened shoot is called a _cane_; a branch or trunk two or\r\nmore years old is called an _arm_. Fig. 1 is a shoot as it appears in\r\nthe northern states in June. The whole shoot has grown within a month,\r\nfrom a bud. As it grew, flower clusters appeared and these are to bear\r\nthe grapes. Flowering is now over, but the shoot will continue to grow,\r\nperhaps to the length of ten or twenty feet. At picking time, therefore,\r\nthe grapes all hang near the lower end or base of the shoots or new\r\ncanes, as in fig. 2. Each bud upon the old cane, therefore, produces a\r\nnew cane, which may bear fruit as well as leaves. At the close of the\r\nseason, this long ripened shoot or cane has produced a bud every foot or\r\nless, from which new fruit-bearing shoots are to spring next year. But\r\nif all these buds were allowed to remain, the vine would be overtaxed\r\nwith fruit the coming year and the crop would be a failure. The cane is,\r\ntherefore, cut off until it bears only as many buds as experience has\r\ntaught us the vine should carry. The cane may be cut back to five or ten\r\nbuds, and perhaps some of these buds will be removed, or \"rubbed off,\"\r\nnext spring if the young growth seems to be too thick, or if the plant\r\nis weak. Each shoot will bear, on an average, two or three clusters.\r\nSome shoots will bear no clusters. From one to six of the old canes,\r\neach bearing from five to ten buds, are left each spring. The number of\r\nclusters which a vine can carry well depends upon the variety, the age\r\nand size of the vine, the style of the training, and the soil and\r\ncultivation. Experience is the only guide. A strong vine of Concord,\r\nwhich is a prolific variety, trained upon any of the ordinary systems\r\nand set nine or ten feet apart each way, will usually carry from thirty\r\nto sixty clusters. The clusters will weigh from a fourth to a half pound\r\neach. Twelve or fifteen pounds of marketable grapes is a fair or average\r\ncrop for such a Concord vine, and twenty-five pounds is a very heavy\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. THE BEARING WOOD.]\r\n\r\nThe pruning of the grape vine, therefore, is essentially a thinning\r\nprocess. In the winter pruning, all the canes of the last season's\r\ngrowth are cut away except from two to six, which are left to make the\r\nfruit and wood of the next year; and each of these remaining canes is\r\nheaded back to from three to ten buds. The number and length of the\r\ncanes which are left after the pruning depend upon the style of training\r\nwhich is practiced. A vine which may completely cover a trellis in the\r\nfall, will be cut back so severely that a novice will fear that the\r\nplant is ruined. But the operator bears in mind the fact that the grape,\r\nunlike the apple, pear and peach, does not bear distinct fruit-buds in\r\nthe fall, but buds which produce both fruit and wood the following\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3. DIAGRAM.]\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose, therefore, that we have pruned our vine in the fall\r\nof 1891 to two canes, each bearing ten buds. We will call these canes A\r\nand B, respectively. (Fig. 3.) In 1892, therefore, twenty shoots grow\r\nfrom them, and each of these shoots or new canes branches, or produces\r\nlaterals. We will call these new canes of 1892, A 1, A 2, A 3, B 1, B 2,\r\nand so on. Each of the new canes bears at the base about two clusters of\r\ngrapes, giving a total yield of about forty clusters. These clusters\r\nstand opposite the leaves, as seen in fig. 1. In the axil of each leaf a\r\nbud is formed which will produce a cane, and perhaps fruit, in 1893. If\r\neach of these new canes, A 1, A 2, etc., produce ten buds--which is a\r\nmoderate number--the vine would go into the winter of 1892-3 with 200\r\nbuds for the next year's growth and crop; but these buds should be\r\nreduced to about twenty, as they were in the fall of 1891. That is,\r\nevery year we go back again to the same number of buds, and the top of\r\nthe vine gets no larger from year to year. We must, therefore, cut back\r\nagain to two canes. We cut back each of the original canes, A and B, to\r\none new cane. That is, we leave only A 1 and B 1, cutting off A 2, A 3,\r\netc., and B 2, B 3, etc. This brings the vine back to very nearly its\r\ncondition in the fall of 1891; but the new canes, A 1 and B 1, which are\r\nnow to become the main canes by being bent down horizontally, were borne\r\nat some distance--say three or four inches--from the base of the\r\noriginal canes, A and B, so that the permanent part of the vine is\r\nconstantly lengthening itself. This annually lengthening portion is\r\ncalled a _spur_. Spurs are rarely or never made in this exact position,\r\nhowever, although this diagrammatic sketch illustrates clearly the\r\nmethod of their formation. The common method of spurring is that\r\nconnected with the horizontal arm system of training, in which the canes\r\nA and B are allowed to become permanent arms, and the upright canes, A\r\n1, A 2, B 1, B 2, B 3, etc., are cut back to within two or three buds of\r\nthe arms each year. The cane A 1, for instance, is cut back in the fall\r\nof 1892 to two or three buds, and in 1893 two or three canes will grow\r\nfrom this stub. In the fall of 1893 only one cane is left after the\r\npruning, and this one is cut back to two or three buds; and so on. So\r\nthe spur grows higher every year, although every effort is made to keep\r\nit short, both by reducing the number of buds to one or two and by\r\nendeavoring to bring out a cane lower down on the spur every few years.\r\nFig. 4 shows a short spur of two years' standing. The horizontal portion\r\nshows the permanent arm. The first upright portion is the remains of the\r\nfirst-year cane and the upper portion is the second-year cane after it\r\nis cut back in the fall. In this instance, the cane is cut back to one\r\nfruiting bud, _b_, the small buds, _a a_, being rubbed out. There are\r\nserious objections to spurs in any position. They become hard and\r\ncomparatively lifeless after a time, it is often difficult to replace\r\nthem by healthy fresh wood, and the bearing portion of the vine is\r\nconstantly receding from the main trunk. The bearing wood should spring\r\nfrom near the central portions of the vine, or be kept \"near the head,\"\r\nas the grape-growers say. In order to do this, it is customary to allow\r\ntwo canes to grow out each year back of the canes A 1 and B 1, or from\r\nthe head of the vine; these canes may be designated C and D. (Fig. 3.)\r\nThese canes, C and D, are grown during 1892--when they may bear fruit\r\nlike other canes--for the sole purpose of forming the basis of the\r\nbearing top in 1893, while all the old top, A and B, with the secondary\r\ncanes, A 1, A 2, B 1, B 2, B 3, etc., is cut entirely away. Here, then,\r\nare two distinct methods of forming the bearing top for the succeeding\r\nyear: either from _spurs_, which are the remains of the previous top; or\r\nfrom _renewals_, which are taken each year from the old wood near the\r\nhead of the vine, or even from the ground. Renewals from the ground are\r\nnow little used, however, for they seldom give a sufficient crop unless\r\nthey are headed in the first fall and are allowed to bear the second\r\nyear. It should be borne in mind that the spur and renewal methods refer\r\nentirely to pruning, not to training, for either one can be used in any\r\nsystem of training. Spur pruning, however, is growing in disfavor\r\namongst commercial grape-growers, and the renewal is more or less used\r\nin all systems of training.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. SPUR.]\r\n\r\nFig. 5 illustrates a renewal pruning. This engraving shows the head of a\r\nvine seven years old, and upon which two canes are allowed to remain\r\nafter each annual pruning. The portion extending from _b_ to _f_ and _d_\r\nis the base of the bearing cane of 1892. In the winter of 1892-3, this\r\ncane is cut off at _d_, and the new cane, _e_, is left to make the\r\nbearing wood of 1893. Another cane sprung from _f_, but it was too weak\r\nto leave for fruiting. It was, therefore, cut away. The old stub, _b_,\r\n_f_, _d_, will be cut away a year hence, in the winter of 1893-4. In the\r\nmeantime, a renewal cane will have grown from the stub _c_, which is\r\nleft for that purpose, and the old cane, _b d_, will be cut off just\r\nbeyond it, between _c_ and _f_. In this way, the bearing wood is kept\r\nclose to the head of the vine. The wound _a_ shows where an old stub\r\nwas cut away this winter, 1892-3, while _b_ shows where one was cut off\r\nthe previous winter. A scar upon the back of the head, which does not\r\nshow in the illustration, marks the spot where a stub was cut away two\r\nyears ago, in the winter of 1890-1. This method of pruning can be kept\r\nup almost indefinitely, and if care is exercised in keeping the stubs\r\nshort, the head will not enlarge out of proportion to the growth of the\r\nstock or trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5. RENEWAL PRUNING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pruning Young Vines._--The time required after planting to get the vine\r\nonto the wires or trellis varies with the strength of the vine when set,\r\nthe variety, the soil and cultivation, and the system of training; but,\r\nas a rule, the training begins the second or third year, previous to\r\nwhich time the vine is pruned, not trained. Two-year-old vines are most\r\npopular for planting, although in the strong varieties, like Concord and\r\nNiagara, well-grown yearling vines are probably as good, if not better.\r\nThe strong-growing kinds are commonly set from eight to ten feet apart\r\nin the row, and the rows eight or nine feet apart. Delawares and other\r\nsmall vines may be set closer, although eight feet is preferable. When\r\nset, the vine is cut back to two or three buds. During the first year,\r\nthe young canes are usually allowed to lie upon the ground at will, as\r\nseen in fig. 6. In the fall or winter, all the canes but one are cut\r\noff, and this one is cut back to two or three buds. The vine is,\r\ntherefore, no larger at the expiration of a year's growth than it was\r\nwhen planted; but in the meantime the plant has become thoroughly\r\nestablished in the soil, and the second year's growth should be strong\r\nenough to form the basis for the permanent trunk or arm. If, however,\r\nthe second year's growth is weak, it may be cut back as before, and the\r\nthird season's growth used for the trunk. On the other hand, the growth\r\nof the first year is sometimes carried onto the wires to form the\r\npermanent trunk and arms, but it is only with extra strong vines in good\r\nsoil that this practice is admissible. From this point, the treatment\r\nof the vine is discussed under training.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6. A NEWLY SET VINEYARD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_When to Prune._--Grape vines may be pruned at any time during the\r\nwinter. It is the practice among most grape-growers in the north to\r\nprune as time permits from November to late in February, or even early\r\nMarch. The sap flows very freely from cuts made in spring and early\r\nsummer, causing the phenomenon known as \"bleeding,\" or in Europe as\r\n\"weeping,\" and in order to prevent this loss, pruning is stopped six\r\nweeks or more before the time at which the buds usually swell. It is yet\r\na moot point if this bleeding injures the vine, but it is a safe\r\npractice to prune early. The vine is cut off an inch or two beyond the\r\nlast bud which it is desired to leave, in order to avoid injury to the\r\nbud from the drying out of the end of the cane.\r\n\r\nThe pruning is done with small hand pruning-shears. The canes are often\r\nallowed to remain tied to the wires until the pruning is accomplished,\r\nalthough it is the practice with most growers who use the Kniffin system\r\nto cut the strings before pruning. The removal of the severed canes is\r\nknown as \"stripping.\" In large vineyards, the pruner sometimes leaves\r\nthe stripping to boys or other cheap labor. The stripping may be done at\r\nany time after the pruning is performed until spring. It must be done\r\nbefore the growth starts on the remaining portions of the vine, however,\r\nto avoid injury to the young buds when tearing the vines off the\r\ntrellis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summer Pruning._--There is much discussion as to the advisability of\r\nsummer pruning. It is essential to the understanding of the question\r\nthat the grower bear in mind that this summer pruning is of two\r\nkinds--the removal or \"breaking out\" of the superfluous shoots, and\r\nheading-in or \"stopping\" the main canes to keep them within limits. The\r\nsuperfluous shoots are such as spring from small, weak buds or those\r\nwhich break from the old arms or trunk of the vine. Shoots which start\r\nfrom the very base of the old cane are usually weak and should be\r\nremoved. Buds in this position are shown at _a a_, in fig. 4. The\r\nsecondary or axillary branches, which often start from the base of the\r\nseason's shoots, should be removed or broken out. These superfluous\r\nshoots are pulled off from time to time as they appear, or the buds may\r\nbe rubbed off before the shoots begin to grow.\r\n\r\nThe heading-in of the main canes, while desirable for the purpose of\r\nkeeping the vine within bounds, is apt to cause a growth of laterals\r\nwhich choke up the vine and which do not mature, and in those styles of\r\ntraining in which very little wood is allowed to grow, the practice may\r\nprevent the development of a sufficient amount of leaf surface to\r\nproperly sustain the vine. Vines are often weakened by summer pruning.\r\nThese dangers can be overcome by careful attention, however, especially\r\nby heading-in very lightly and by doing it as late in the season as\r\npossible, when new lateral growth does not start readily. The necessity\r\nof much heading-in has been largely obviated in late years by the\r\nadoption of high or drooping systems of training, and by setting the\r\nvines far apart. The strong varieties, like Concord, Brighton and\r\nNiagara, should be set ten feet apart in the row, especially if grown\r\nupon the Kniffin system. Catawba, being a very upright grower and\r\nespecially well adapted to upright training, may be set eight feet\r\napart, and Delawares are often set as close as six or eight feet. It is\r\ndoubtful, however, if any variety should be set less than eight feet\r\napart for trellis culture. In Virginia and southward, where the growth\r\nis large because of the long seasons, vines are often set more than ten\r\nfeet apart. In the South, the rows should run north and south, that the\r\nfruit may be shaded from midday sun. The only summer heading-in now\r\ngenerally recommended is the clipping of the tips when they fall over\r\nand begin to touch the ground. This clipping is often done with a sickle\r\nor sharp corn-cutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objects of Pruning._--The objects of pruning the grape, as of other\r\nfruits, are five:\r\n\r\n  1. To produce larger and better fruit.\r\n\r\n  2. To maintain or augment the vigor of the vine.\r\n\r\n  3. To keep the vine within manageable limits.\r\n\r\n  4. To facilitate cultivation.\r\n\r\n  5. To facilitate spraying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PREPARATIONS FOR TRAINING--THE TRELLIS--TYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining the grape vine is practiced for the purpose of keeping the vine\r\nin convenient shape and to allow each cluster to receive its full amount\r\nof space and light. A well trained vine is easily cultivated and\r\nsprayed, and the grapes are readily harvested, and it is only upon such\r\nvines that the best and fairest fruit is uniformly produced. Some kind\r\nof training is essential, for a vine will not often bear good fruit when\r\nit lies upon the ground. In essence, there are three general types or\r\nstyles of training, which may be designated as the upright, drooping and\r\nhorizontal, these terms designating the direction of the bearing shoots.\r\nThe upright systems carry two or more canes or arms along a low\r\nhorizontal wire, or sometimes obliquely across a trellis from below\r\nupwards, and the shoots are tied up as they grow to the wires above. The\r\nhorizontal systems carry up a perpendicular cane or arm, or sometimes\r\ntwo or more, from which the shoots are carried out horizontally and are\r\ntied to perpendicular wires or posts. The drooping systems, represented\r\nin the Kniffin and post-training, carry the canes or arms upon a high\r\nhorizontal wire or trellis and allow the shoots to hang without tying.\r\nTo one or another of these types all the systems of American\r\ngrape-training can be referred.\r\n\r\nThere is no system of training which is best for all purposes and all\r\nvarieties. The strong-growing varieties more readily adapt themselves to\r\nthe high drooping systems than the weaker varieties, although the\r\nDelaware is often trained on a comparatively low Kniffin with good\r\neffect. The high or drooping systems are of comparatively recent date,\r\nand their particular advantages are the saving of labor in summer tying,\r\ncheapness of the trellis, and the facility with which the ground can be\r\ncultivated without endangering the branches of the vine. The upright\r\ntraining distributes the bearing wood more evenly upon the vine and is\r\nthought, therefore, to insure more uniform fruit, it keeps the top near\r\nthe root, which is sometimes thought to be an advantage, and it is\r\nbetter suited to the stature of the small-growing varieties. There is,\r\nperhaps, a greater temptation to neglect the vines in the drooping\r\nsystems than in the others, because the shoots need no tying and do not,\r\ntherefore, demand frequent attention; while in the upright systems the\r\nshoots soon become broken or displaced if not watched. For very large\r\nareas, or circumstances in which the best of care cannot be given the\r\nvineyard, the Kniffin or drooping systems are perhaps always to be\r\nrecommended. Yet the Kniffin profits as much from diligence and skill as\r\nthe other systems; but it will give better results than the others\r\nunder partial neglect. The strong varieties, especially those making\r\nlong and drooping canes, are well adapted to the Kniffin styles; but the\r\nsmaller sorts, and those stronger sorts which, like Catawba, make an\r\nupright and stocky growth, are usually trained upon the upright systems.\r\nBut the merits of both systems are so various and even so little\r\nunderstood, that it is impossible to recommend either one unqualifiedly.\r\nThe advantages in either case are often little more than matters of\r\npersonal opinion. It should be said, however, that the Kniffin or\r\ndrooping systems are gaining in favor rapidly, and are evidently\r\ndestined to overthrow much of the older upright training. This fact does\r\nnot indicate, however, that the upright system is to be entirety\r\nsuperseded, but rather that it must be confined to those varieties and\r\nconditions for which it is best adapted. The two systems will\r\nundoubtedly supplement each other. The horizontal systems are\r\noccasionally used for choice varieties, but they are little known.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Making the Trellis._--The fall or winter following the planting of the\r\nvineyard, the trellis is begun if the upright systems are used; but this\r\noperation is usually delayed a year longer in the Kniffin systems, and\r\nstakes are commonly used, or at least recommended, during the second\r\nseason. In the South the trellis is made the first year. The style of\r\ntrellis will depend upon the style of training, but the main features\r\nare the same for all. Strong posts of some durable timber, as cedar,\r\nlocust or oak, are placed at such distance apart that two vines can be\r\nset between each two. If the vines are set nine feet apart, the posts\r\nmaybe eighteen or twenty feet apart, and a vine will then stand four or\r\nfive feet from each post. If the posts in the row are eighteen feet\r\napart and the rows eight feet apart, about 330 posts will be required to\r\nthe acre. Except in very hard and stony lands, the posts are driven with\r\na heavy maul, although many people prefer to set the end posts in holes,\r\nthinking that they endure the strain better. In all loose soils,\r\nhowever, posts can be made as firm by driving as by setting with a\r\nspade. All posts should be as firm as possible, in order to hold up the\r\nheavy loads of vines and fruit. In setting posts on hillsides, it is a\r\ncommon practice to lean them slightly uphill, for there is always a\r\ntendency for the posts to tilt down the slope. For the Kniffin systems,\r\nespecially for the strong-growing grapes, the posts must stand six or\r\nsix and one-half feet high when set, but a foot less will usually be\r\nsufficient for the upright and horizontal systems. The posts should\r\nstand higher at first than is necessary for the support of the wires,\r\nfor they will need to be driven down occasionally as they become loose.\r\nThe end posts of each row should be well braced, as shown in several of\r\nthe illustrations in this volume.\r\n\r\nThe wire ordinarily used is No. 12, except for the top wire in the\r\nKniffin training, which is usually No. 10, as the greater part of the\r\nweight is then upon the top wire. No. 9 is sometimes used, but it is\r\nheavier than necessary. No. 14 is occasionally used for the middle and\r\nupper rows in the upright systems, but it is not strong enough. The\r\nfollowing figures show the sizes and weights of these and similar iron\r\nand steel wires:\r\n\r\n  No.    Diameter in inches.    Weight of 100 feet.

Of No. 12\r\nwire, about 160 pounds is required per acre for a single run on rows\r\neight feet apart, and about 500 pounds for three runs. The cost of No.\r\n12 wire per acre, for three runs, therefore, is about $15.\r\n\r\nThe wire is secured to the intermediate posts by staples driven in\r\nfirmly so that the wire will not pull through readily of its own weight,\r\nbut still loosely enough to allow of the tightening of the wires. In\r\nother words, the head of the staple should not quite touch the wire.\r\nGrape staples are of three lengths, about an inch, inch and a quarter,\r\nand an inch and a half respectively. The shortest length is little\r\nused. The medium length is used for hard-wood posts and the longest for\r\nsoft posts, like chestnut and cedar. These staples cost five cents per\r\npound usually, and a pound of the medium length contains from 90 to 100\r\nof the No. 10 wire size. An acre, for three wires, will therefore\r\nrequire, for this size, about nine or ten pounds of staples. In windy\r\nregions, the wires should be placed upon the windward side of the posts.\r\n\r\nThere are various devices for securing the wire to the end posts, but\r\nthe commonest method is to wind them about the post once and secure them\r\nwith a staple, or twist the end of the wire back upon itself, forming a\r\nloop. The wires should be drawn taut to prevent sagging with the weight\r\nof fruit and leaves. In order to allow for the contraction of the wires\r\nin winter, some growers loosen the wires after harvest and others\r\nprovide some device which will relieve the strain. The Yeoman's Patent\r\nGrape-Vine Trellis is a simple and effective lever-contrivance attached\r\nto each wire, and which is operated to loosen the wires in fall and to\r\ntighten them in spring. The end post is sometimes provided upon the back\r\nwith a square-headed pin which works tightly in an inch and a half augur\r\nhole and about which the end of the wire is wound. A square-headed iron\r\nwrench operates the pin, while the tension of the wire around the side\r\nof the post keeps the pin from slipping. This device is not durable,\r\nhowever. An ingenious man can easily contrive some device for relieving\r\nthe tension, if he should think it necessary. As a matter of practice,\r\nhowever, the wires soon stretch and sag enough with the burden of fruit\r\nand vines to take up the winter contraction, and most growers do not\r\nrelease the wires in fall. It will be found necessary, in fact, to\r\ntighten the wires and to straighten up the posts from year to year, as\r\nthey become loose. It is always a profitable labor to tamp the ground\r\nfirmly about all the posts every spring. The wires should always be kept\r\ntight during the growing season to prevent the whipping of the vines by\r\nwind. This is especially important in white grapes, which are discolored\r\nby the rubbing of leaves and twigs. Unless the vines are very strong it\r\nwill be necessary to stretch only one wire the first winter.\r\n\r\nTrellises are often made of slats, as shown in Fig. 18, but these are\r\nalways less durable than the wire trellises and more expensive to keep\r\nin repair; and in the older portions of the country, where timber is\r\ndear, they are also more expensive at the outset. They catch the wind,\r\nand, not being held together by continuous strands, are likely to blow\r\ndown in sections. Fuller particulars concerning the styles of trellis\r\nare given in the discussions of the different systems of training.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tying._--Probably the best material for tying the canes and shoots to\r\nthe trellis is raffia. This is a bast-like material which comes in\r\nskeins and which can be bought of seedsmen and nurserymen for about 20\r\ncents a pound. A pound will suffice to tie a quarter of an acre of\r\nupright training throughout the season. Raffia is obtained from the\r\nstrippings of an oriental palm (_Raphia Ruffia_). Wool-twine is also\r\nstill largely used for tying, but it is not so cheap and handy as\r\nraffia, and it usually has to be cut when the trellis is stripped at the\r\nwinter pruning, while the raffia breaks with a quick pull of the vine.\r\nSome complain that the raffia is not strong enough to hold the vine\r\nduring the season, but it can easily be doubled. Osier willows are much\r\nused for tying up the canes in the spring, and also for summer tying,\r\nespecially in the nursery regions where the slender trimmings of the\r\ncultivated osier willows are easily procured. Wild willows are often\r\nused if they can be obtained handily. These willows are tied up in a\r\nsmall bundle, which is held upon the back above the hips by a cord\r\npassed about the body. The butts project under the right hand, if the\r\nperson is right-handed, and the strands are pulled out as needed. The\r\nbutt is first used, the tie being made with a twist and tuck, the strand\r\nis then cut off with a knife, and the twig is operated in like manner\r\nuntil it is used up. When wool-twine is used, the ball is often held in\r\nfront of the workman by a cord which is tied about it and then passed\r\nabout the waist. The ball is unwound from the inside, and it will hold\r\nits shape until the end becomes so short that it will easily drag upon\r\nthe ground. Some workmen carry the ball in a bag, after the manner of\r\ncarrying seed-corn. Raffia is not so easily carried in the field as the\r\nwool-twine or the willow, and this fact interferes with its popularity.\r\nGreen rye-straw, cut directly from the field, is much used for tying the\r\nshoots in summer. Small wire, about two-thirds the size of broom-wire,\r\nis used occasionally for tying up the canes in spring, but it must be\r\nused with care or it will injure the vine. Corn-husks are also employed\r\nfor this purpose when they can be secured. Bass-bark is sometimes used\r\nfor tying, but in most of the grape regions it is difficult to secure,\r\nand it has no advantage over raffia.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the canes be tied up early in spring, for the\r\nbuds are easily broken after they begin to swell. These canes are tied\r\nrather firmly to the wires to hold them steady; but the growing shoots,\r\nwhich are tied during the summer, are fastened more loosely, to allow of\r\nthe necessary increase in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Drawing of grapes)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE UPRIGHT SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upright systems are the oldest and best known of the styles of\r\nAmerican grape training. They consist, essentially, in carrying out two\r\nhorizontal canes, or sometimes arms, upon a low wire and training the\r\nshoots from them vertically upwards. These shoots are tied to the upper\r\nwires as they grow. This type was first clearly and forcibly described\r\nin detail by A. S. Fuller, in his \"Grape Culturist,\" in 1864, and it\r\nbecame known as the Fuller system, although it was practiced many years\r\nprevious to this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Arm Spur System._--There are two types or styles of this\r\nupright system. The older type and the one described in the books, is\r\nknown as the Horizontal Arm Spur training. In this method, the two\r\nhorizontal branches are permanent, or, in other words, they are true\r\narms. The canes are cut back each fall to upright spurs upon these arms,\r\nas explained on page 15 (fig. 4.) Two shoots are often allowed to grow\r\nfrom each of these spurs, as shown in fig. 7. These spurs become\r\novergrown and weak after a few years, and they are renewed from new\r\nshoots which spring from near their base or from the arm itself.\r\nSometimes the whole arm is renewed from the head of the vine, or even\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7. HORIZONTAL ARM SPUR TRAINING.]\r\n\r\nThe number of these upright canes and their distance apart upon these\r\npermanent arms depend upon the variety, the strength of the vine and\r\nsoil and the fancy of the grower. From twelve to twenty inches apart\r\nupon the arm is the common distance. If a vine is strong enough to carry\r\nfive canes and the vines are eight feet apart, then the canes are\r\ndistributed at intervals of about twenty inches. Some very strong vines\r\nof vigorous varieties will carry eight canes upon the two arms\r\ntogether, and in this case the canes stand about a foot apart. In the\r\nfall or winter, the cane is cut away and the strongest new cane which\r\nsprings from its base is left for the bearing wood of the following\r\nyear. This new cane is itself headed in to the height of the trellis;\r\nthat is, if the uppermost and lowermost wires are 34 inches apart--as\r\nthey are in the Brocton vineyards of western New York, where this system\r\nis largely used--this new cane is shortened in to 34 inches long. Upon\r\nthis length of cane there will be about seven good buds in the common\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8. HORIZONTAL ARM. (Diagram.)]\r\n\r\nA modification of this horizontal arm system is shown in fig. 9. It is\r\nused about Forestville, in Chautauqua county, New York. The arms in this\r\ncase are very short, and canes are taken out only at two or three\r\nplaces. The picture shows a vine in which two canes are taken from the\r\nend of each arm, making four canes for the bearing top of the vine.\r\nThese canes are cut back to spurs in the fall, as explained in the above\r\nparagraph. Sometimes one or two other canes are taken out of these arms\r\nnearer the main trunk. The advantages urged for this style of training\r\nare the stronger growth which is insured by so few canes, and the small\r\namount of old or permanent wood which is left to each vine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9. SHORT ARM SPUR TRAINING.]\r\n\r\nThe horizontal arm training is less popular than it was twenty years\r\nago. It has serious faults, especially in the persistence of the old\r\nspurs, and probably will eventually give place to other systems. Aside\r\nfrom the spur pruning, the system is much like the following, which is a\r\nmodification to allow of a renewal pruning and to which the reader is\r\nreferred for further details. This modification, which may be called the\r\nHigh Renewal, and which is one of the most serviceable of any of the\r\nstyles of training, although it has never been fully described, we shall\r\nnow consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The High Renewal_, or upright training which is now very extensively\r\nemployed in the lake regions of New York and elsewhere, starts the head\r\nor branches of the vine from eighteen to thirty inches from the ground.\r\nThe ideal height for most varieties is probably about two feet to the\r\nfirst wire, although thirty inches is better than eighteen. If the vines\r\nare lower than two feet, they are liable to be injured by the plow or\r\ncultivator, the earth is dashed against the clusters by heavy rains, and\r\nif the shoots become loose they strike the ground and the grapes are\r\nsoon soiled. A single trunk or arm is carried up to the required height,\r\nor if good branches happen to form lower down, two main canes are\r\ncarried from this point up to the required distance to meet the lower\r\nwire, so that the trunk becomes Y-shaped, as seen in figs. 10, 16 and\r\n17. In fact, vineyardists usually prefer to have this head or crotch a\r\nfew inches below the lowest wire, to facilitate the spreading and\r\nplacing of the canes. The trellis for the upright systems nearly always\r\ncomprises three wires, although only two are sometimes used for the\r\nsmaller growing varieties, and very rarely four are used for the\r\nstrongest kinds, although this number is unnecessary. The lowest wire is\r\nstretched at eighteen, twenty-four or thirty inches from the ground, and\r\nthe two upper ones are placed at distances of eighteen or twenty inches\r\napart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10. THE SECOND SEASON OF UPRIGHT TRAINING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11. MAKING THE T-HEAD.]\r\n\r\nThe second season after planting should see the vine tied to the first\r\nwire. Fig. 10 is a photograph taken in July, 1892, of a Concord vine\r\nwhich was set in the spring of 1891. In the fall of 1891 the vine was\r\ncut back to three or four buds, and in the spring of 1892 two of these\r\nbuds were allowed to make canes. These two canes are now tied to the\r\nwire, which was stretched in the spring of 1892. In this case, the\r\nbranches start near the surface of the ground. Sometimes only a single\r\nstrong shoot grows, and in order to secure the two branches it is broken\r\nover where it passes the wire, and is usually tied to a stake to afford\r\nsupport. Fig. 11 shows this operation. A bud will develop at the bend or\r\nbreak, from which a cane can be trained in the opposite direction from\r\nthe original portion, and the T-head is secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12. THE THIRD SEASON OF HIGH RENEWAL.--CONCORD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13. HIGH RENEWAL, BEFORE PRUNING.--CATAWBA.]\r\n\r\nThe close of the second season after planting, therefore, will usually\r\nfind the vine with two good canes extending in opposite directions and\r\ntied to the wire. The pruning at that time will consist in cutting off\r\nthe ends of these canes back to firm and strong wood, which will leave\r\nthem bearing from five to eight buds. The third season, shoots will grow\r\nupright from these buds and will be tied to the second wire, which has\r\nnow been supplied. Late in the third season the vine should have much\r\nthe appearance of that shown in fig. 12. The third wire is usually added\r\nto the trellis at the close of the second season, at the same time that\r\nthe second wire is put on; but occasionally this is delayed until the\r\nclose of the third season. Some of the upright shoots may bear a few\r\ngrapes this third season, but unless the vines are very strong the\r\nflower clusters should be removed; and a three-year-old vine should\r\nnever be allowed to bear heavily. It must be remembered, however, that\r\nboth these horizontal canes, with all their mass of herbage, are to be\r\ncut away in the fall or winter of the third year. Some provision must\r\nhave been made, therefore, for the top for the fourth year. It will be\r\nrecalled that in discussing the renewal pruning (page 16, fig. 5), it\r\nwas found that two or more shoots are allowed to grow each year to form\r\nthe basis of the top the following year. In fig. 12 three or four such\r\nshoots can be seen springing from the Y-shaped portion in the center of\r\nthe vine. These shoots or canes are to be bent down to the lowest wire\r\nnext spring, and the bearing shoots will arise from them. This process\r\nwill be seen at a glance from figs. 13, 14 and 15. The first shows a\r\nfull grown old vine, trained on three wires. Fig. 14 shows the same vine\r\nwhen pruned. Two long canes, with six or eight buds each, are left to\r\nform the top of the following year. The two stubs from which the renewal\r\ncanes are to grow for the second year's top are seen in the center. In\r\nthe fall of the next year, therefore, these two outside canes will be\r\ncut away to the base of these renewal stubs; and the renewal canes, in\r\nthe meantime, will have made a year's growth. These renewal stubs in\r\nthis picture are really spurs, as will be seen; that is, they contain\r\ntwo ages of wood. It is the purpose, however, to remove these stubs or\r\nspurs every two or three years at most, and to bring new canes\r\ndirectly from the old wood or head. If possible, the renewal cane is\r\nbrought from a new place on the old wood every year in order to avoid a\r\nspur. Such was the case in the vine shown in fig. 5, page 19. Fig. 15\r\nshows the same vine tied down to the lowest wire. Two ties have been\r\nmade upon each cane. Fig. 16 shows a vine in which four canes have been\r\nleft to form the top for the following year. The stubs for the renewals\r\ncan be seen in the Y. It is customary to leave more than two canes,\r\noccasionally, in strong-growing varieties like Concord. Sometimes four\r\nand occasionally six are left. If four canes are left, two may be tied\r\ntogether in each direction upon the bottom wire. If six are used, the\r\ntwo extra ones should be tied along the second wire, parallel with the\r\nlowest ones. These extra canes are sometimes tied obliquely across the\r\ntrellis, but this practice should be discouraged, for the usual tendency\r\nof the vine is to make its greatest growth at the top, and the lower\r\nbuds may fail to bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14. HIGH RENEWAL, PRUNED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15. HIGH RENEWAL, PRUNED AND TIED.]\r\n\r\nThe ideal length of the two canes varies with different varieties and\r\nthe distance apart at which the vines are set. Very strong kinds, like\r\nConcord and Niagara, can carry ten or twelve buds on each cane,\r\nespecially if the vines are set more than eight feet apart. Fig. 17\r\nshows half of a Concord vine in which about ten buds were left on each\r\ncane. These strong sorts can often carry forty or fifty buds to the vine\r\nto advantage, but when this number is left the canes should be four, as\r\nexplained in the last paragraph. In Delaware and other weak-growing\r\nvarieties, twenty or twenty-five buds to the vine should be the maximum\r\nand only two canes should be left. In short-jointed varieties, the canes\r\nare usually cut to the desired length--four to six feet--even if too\r\ngreat a number of buds is left, but the shoots which spring from these\r\nextra buds are broken out soon after they start. A Delaware vine which\r\nhas made an unusually short or weak growth will require fewer buds to be\r\nleft for next year's top than a neighboring vine of the same variety\r\nwhich has made a strong growth. The Catawba, which is a short but very\r\nstiff grower, is usually cut back to six or eight buds, as seen in figs.\r\n13, 14 and 15. The grower soon learns to adjust the pruning to the\r\ncharacter of the vine without effort. He has in his mind a certain ideal\r\ncrop of grapes, perhaps about so many bunches, and he leaves enough buds\r\nto produce this amount, allowing, perhaps, ten per cent. of the buds for\r\naccidents and barren shoots. He knows, too, that the canes should always\r\nbe cut back to firm, well-ripened wood. It should be said that mere\r\nsize of cane does not indicate its value as a fruit-bearing branch.\r\nHard, smooth wood of medium size usually gives better results than the\r\nvery large and softer canes which are sometimes produced on soils rich\r\nin nitrogenous manures. This large and overgrown wood is known as a\r\n\"bull cane.\" A cane does not attain its full growth the first year, but\r\nwill increase in diameter during the second season. The tying therefore,\r\nshould be sufficiently loose or elastic to allow of growth, although it\r\nshould be firm enough to hold the cane constantly in place. The cane\r\nshould not be hung from the wire, but tied close to it, provision being\r\nmade for the swelling of the wood to twice its diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16. HIGH RENEWAL WITH FOUR CANES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17. HIGH RENEWAL COMPLETE.--CONCORD.]\r\n\r\nThe shoots are tied to the second wire soon after they pass it, or have\r\nattained firmness enough to allow of tying, and the same shoots are tied\r\nagain to the top wire. All the shoots do not grow with equal rapidity,\r\nand the vineyard must be gone over more than twice if the shoots are\r\nkept properly tied. Perhaps four times over the vineyard will be all\r\nthat is necessary for careful summer tying. Many vineyardists tie only\r\nonce or twice, but this neglect should be discouraged. This tying is\r\nmostly done with green rye straw or raffia. A piece of straw about ten\r\ninches long is used for each tie, it usually being wrapped but once\r\nabout the shoot. The knot is made with a twist and tuck. If raffia is\r\nused, a common string-knot is made. When the shoots reach the top of\r\nthe trellis, they are usually allowed to take care of themselves. The\r\nCatawba shoots stand nearly erect above the top wire and ordinarily need\r\nno attention. The long-growing varieties will be likely to drag the\r\nshoots upon the ground before the close of the season. If these tips\r\ninterfere with the cultivation, they may be clipped off with a sickle or\r\ncorn-cutter, although this practice should be delayed as long as\r\npossible to prevent the growth of laterals (see page 21). It is probably\r\nbetter to avoid cutting entirely. Some growers wind or tie the longest\r\nshoots upon the top wire, as seen in fig. 17. It is probably best, as a\r\nrule, to allow the shoots to hang over naturally, and to clip them only\r\nwhen they seriously interfere with the work of the hoe and cultivator.\r\nThe treatment for slat trellises, as shown in fig. 18, is the same as on\r\nwire trellises, except that longer strings must be used in tying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18. A SLAT TRELLIS, WITH UPRIGHT TRAINING.]\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that nearly or quite all the fruit in the High Renewal is\r\nborne between the first and second wires, at the bottom of the trellis.\r\nIf the lower wire is twenty-four or thirty inches high, this fruit will\r\nhang at the most convenient height for picking. The fruit trays are set\r\nupon the ground, and both hands are free. The fruit is also protected\r\nfrom the hot suns and from frost; and if the shoots are properly tied,\r\nthe clusters are not shaken roughly by the wind. It is, of course,\r\ndesirable that all the clusters should be fully exposed to light and\r\nair, and all superfluous shoots should, therefore, be pulled off, as\r\nalready explained (page 21). In rare cases it may also be necessary, for\r\nthis purpose, to prune the canes which droop over from the top of the\r\ntrellis.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years, the old top or head of the vine becomes more or less\r\nweak and it should be renewed from the root. The thrifty vineyardist\r\nanticipates this circumstance, and now and then allows a thrifty shoot\r\nwhich may spring from the ground to remain. This shoot is treated very\r\nmuch like a young vine, and the head is formed during the second year\r\n(page 16, bottom). If it should make a strong growth during the first\r\nyear and develop stout laterals, it may be cut back only to the lowest\r\nwire the first fall; but in other cases, it should be cut back to two or\r\nthree buds, from one of which a strong and permanent shoot is taken the\r\nsecond year. When this new top comes into bearing, the old trunk is cut\r\noff at the surface of the ground, or below if possible. A top will\r\nretain its vigor for six or eight years under ordinary treatment, and\r\nsometimes much longer. These tops are renewed from time to time as\r\noccasion permits or demands, and any vineyard which has been bearing a\r\nnumber of years will nearly always have a few vines in process of\r\nrenewal. The reader should not receive the impression, however, that the\r\nlife or vitality of a vine is necessarily limited. Vines often continue\r\nto bear for twenty years or more without renewal; but the head after a\r\ntime comes to be large and rough and crooked, and often weakened by\r\nscars, and better results are likely to be obtained if a new, clean vine\r\ntakes its place.\r\n\r\nThe High Renewal is extensively used in the lake region of Western New\r\nYork, for all varieties. It is particularly well adapted to Delaware,\r\nCatawba, and other weak or short varieties. When systematically pursued,\r\nit gives fruit of the highest excellence. This High Renewal training,\r\nlike all the low upright systems, allows the vines to be laid down\r\neasily in winter, which is an important consideration in many parts of\r\nCanada and in the colder northern states.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fan Training._--A system much used a few years ago and still sometimes\r\nseen, is one which renews back nearly to the ground each year, and\r\ncarries the fruiting canes up in a fan-shaped manner. This system has\r\nthe advantages of dispensing with much of the old wood, or trunk, and\r\nfacilitating laying down the vine in winter in cold climates. On the\r\nother hand, it has the disadvantages of bearing the fruit too\r\nlow--unless the lower clusters are removed--and making a vine of\r\ninconvenient shape for tying. It is little used at present. Fig. 19\r\nshows a vine pruned for fan-training, although it is by no means an\r\nideal vine. This vine has not been properly renewed, but bears long,\r\ncrooked spurs, from which the canes spring. One of these spurs will be\r\nseen to extend beyond the lower wire. The spurs should be kept very\r\nshort, and they should be entirely removed every two or three years, as\r\nexplained in the above discussion of the High Renewal training.\r\n\r\nThe shoots are allowed to take their natural course, being tied to any\r\nwire near which they chance to grow, finally lopping over the top wire.\r\nSometimes the canes are bent down and tied horizontally to the wires,\r\nand this is probably the better practice. Two canes may be tied in each\r\ndirection on the lower wire, or the two inner canes may be tied down to\r\nthe second wire. In either case, the vine is essentially like the High\r\nRenewal, except that the trunk is shorter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19. FAN TRAINING, AFTER PRUNING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE DROOPING SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1845 William T. Cornell planted a vineyard in the Hudson River\r\nValley. A neighbor, William Kniffin, was a stone mason with a few acres\r\nof land to which he devoted his attention during the leisure seasons of\r\nhis trade. Cornell induced Kniffin to plant a few grapes. He planted the\r\nIsabella, and succeeding beyond his expectations, the plantation was\r\nincreased into a respectable vineyard and Kniffin came to be regarded as\r\na local authority upon grape culture. Those were the pioneer days in\r\ncommercial grape growing in North America, and there were no undisputed\r\nmaxims of cultivation and training. If any system of close training and\r\npruning was employed, it was probably the old horizontal arm spur\r\nsystem, or something like it. One day a large limb broke from an\r\napple-tree and fell upon a grape-vine, tearing off some of the canes and\r\ncrushing the vine into a singular shape. The vine was thought to be\r\nruined, but it was left until the fruit could be gathered. But as the\r\nfruit matured, its large size and handsome appearance attracted\r\nattention. It was the best fruit in the vineyard! Mr. Kniffin was an\r\nobservant man, and he inquired into the cause of the excellent fruit.\r\nHe noticed that the vine had been pruned and that the best canes stood\r\nout horizontally. From this suggestion he developed the four-cane system\r\nof training which now bears his name. A year or two later, in 1854, the\r\nsystem had attracted the attention of those of his neighbors who\r\ncultivated grapes, and thereafter it spread throughout the Hudson\r\nvalley, where it is to-day, with various modifications, the chief method\r\nof grape training. Its merits have become known beyond its original\r\nvalley, and it is now spreading more rapidly than any other system. The\r\nground upon which the old Isabellas grew is now occupied by Concords,\r\nwhich are as vigorous and productive as those grown upon newer soils.\r\nWilliam Kniffin died at his home in Clintondale, Ulster county, New\r\nYork, June 13, 1876, at fifty-seven years of age. The portrait is from a\r\nphotograph which was taken two or three years before his death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20. WILLIAM KNIFFIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The True or Four-Cane Kniffin System._--Figure 21 shows the true\r\nKniffin system, very nearly as practiced by its originator. A single\r\nstem or trunk is carried directly to the top wire, and two canes are\r\ntaken out from side spurs at each wire. Mr. Kniffin believed in short\r\ncanes, and cut them back to about six buds on both wires. But most\r\ngrowers now prefer to leave the upper canes longer than the lower ones,\r\nas seen in illustration. The bearing shoots are allowed to hang at will,\r\nso that no summer tying is necessary; this is the distinguishing mark of\r\nthe various Kniffin systems. The main trunk is tied to each wire, and\r\nthe canes are tied to the wires in spring. This system possesses the\r\ngreat advantage, therefore, of requiring little labor during the busy\r\ndays of the growing season; and the vines are easily cultivated, and if\r\nthe rows are nine or ten feet apart, currants or other bush-fruits can\r\nbe grown between. The system is especially adapted to the strong\r\nvarieties of grapes. For further comparisons of the merits of different\r\nsystems of training, the reader should consult Chapter II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21. THE TRUE KNIFFIN TRAINING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22. NO. 21 WHEN PRUNED.]\r\n\r\nThe pruning of the Kniffin vine consists in cutting off all the wood\r\nsave a single cane from each spur. Fig. 22 illustrates the process. This\r\nis the same vine which is shown with the full amount of wood on in fig.\r\n21. The drooping shoots shown in that illustration bore the grapes of\r\n1892; and now, in the winter of 1892-93, they are all to be cut away,\r\nwith the horizontal old canes from which they grew, save only the four\r\ncanes which hang nearest the main trunk. Fig. 22 shows the vine after it\r\nhad been pruned. It is not obligatory that the canes which are left\r\nafter the pruning should be those nearest the trunk, for it may happen\r\nthat these may be weak; but, other things being equal, these canes are\r\npreferable because their selection keeps the old spurs short. The\r\ncareful grower will take pains to remove the weak shoots which start\r\nfrom this point, in order that a strong cane may be obtained. It is\r\ndesirable that these side spurs be removed entirely every three or four\r\nyears, a new cane being brought out again from the main body or trunk.\r\nThere is little expectation, however, that there shall be such a\r\ncomplete renewal pruning as that practiced in the High Renewal, which we\r\ndiscussed in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the drooping canes in fig. 22 are shorter than they\r\nwere originally, as shown in fig. 21. They have been cut back. The\r\nlength at which these canes shall be left is a moot point. Much depends\r\nupon the variety, the distance between the wires, the strength of the\r\nsoil, and other factors. Nearly all growers now agree that the upper\r\ncanes should be longer than the lower ones, although equal canes are\r\nstill used in some places. In strong varieties, like Worden, each of the\r\nupper canes may bear ten buds and each of the lower ones five. This\r\ngives thirty buds to the vine. Some growers prefer to leave twelve buds\r\nabove and only four below.\r\n\r\nThese four pruned canes are generally allowed to hang during winter, but\r\nare tied onto the wires before the buds swell in spring. They are\r\nstretched out horizontally and secured to the wire by one or two ties\r\nupon each cane. The shoots which spring from these horizontal canes\r\nstand upright or oblique at first but they soon fall over with the\r\nweight of foliage and fruit. If they touch the ground, the ends may be\r\nclipped off with a sickle, corn-cutter or scythe, although this is not\r\nalways done, and is not necessary unless the canes interfere with\r\ncultivation. There is no summer-pinching nor pruning, although the\r\nsuperfluous shoots should be broken out, as in other systems. (See page\r\n23).\r\n\r\nOnly two wires are used in the true Kniffin trellis. The end posts are\r\nusually set in holes, rather than driven, to render them solid, and they\r\nshould always be well braced. The intermediate posts are driven, and\r\nthey usually stand between every alternate vine, or twenty feet apart if\r\nthe vines are ten feet apart--which is a common distance for the most\r\nvigorous varieties. For the strong-growing varieties, the top wire is\r\nplaced from five and one-half to six feet above the ground. Five feet\r\nnine inches is a popular height. The posts will heave sufficiently to\r\nbring the height to six feet, although it is best to \"tap\" the posts\r\nevery spring with a maul in order to drive them back and make them firm.\r\nThe lower wire is usually placed at three and one-half feet. Delawares,\r\nif trained Kniffin, should not stand above five feet four inches, or at\r\nmost five feet six inches. Strong vines on good soil are often put onto\r\nthe trellis the second year, although it is a commoner practice,\r\nperhaps, to stake them the second season, as already explained (page\r\n27), and put them on the wires the third season. The year following the\r\ntying to the trellis, the vine should bear a partial crop. The vine is\r\nusually carried directly to the top wire the first season of training,\r\nalthough it is the practice of some growers, especially outside the\r\nHudson valley, to stop the trunk at the lower wire the first year of\r\npermanent training, and to carry it to the top wire the following year.\r\n\r\nYields from good Kniffin vines will average fully as high and perhaps\r\nhigher than from other species of training. W. D. Barns, of Orange\r\ncounty, New York, has had an annual average of twenty-six pounds of\r\nConcords to the vine for nine years, 1,550 vines being considered in the\r\ncalculation. While the Delaware is not so well suited to the Kniffin\r\nsystem as stronger varieties, it can nevertheless be trained in this\r\nmanner with success, as the following average yields obtained by Mr.\r\nBarns from 200 vines set in 1881 will show:\r\n\r\n  1886            8-1/2  pounds to the vine.\r\n  1887           11-3/4     \"    \"  \"    \"\r\n  1888            8         \"    \"  \"    \"\r\n  1889            9-1/2     \"    \"  \"    \"\r\n  1890            7         \"    \"  \"    \"\r\n  1891           16         \"    \"  \"    \"\r\n  1892           13         \"    \"  \"    \"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modifications of the Four-Cane Kniffin._--Various modifications of this\r\noriginal four-cane Kniffin are in use. The Kniffin idea is often\r\ncarelessly applied to a rack trellis. In such cases, several canes were\r\nallowed to grow where only two should have been left. Fig. 23 is a\r\ncommon but poor style of Kniffin used in some of the large new\r\nvineyards of western New York. It differs from the type in the training\r\nof the young wood. These shoots, instead of being allowed to hang at\r\nwill, are carried out horizontally and either tied to the wire or\r\ntwisted around it. The advantage urged for this modification is the\r\nlittle injury done by wind, but, as a matter of practice, it affords\r\nless protection than the true drooping Kniffin, for in the latter the\r\nshoots from the upper cane soon cling to the lower wire, and the shoots\r\nfrom both tiers of canes protect each other below the lower wire. There\r\nare three serious disadvantages to this holding up of the shoots,--it\r\nmakes unnecessary labor, the canes are likely to make wood or \"bull\r\ncanes\" (see page 50) at the expense of fruit, and the fruit is bunched\r\ntogether on the vines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23. A POOR TYPE OF KNIFFIN.]\r\n\r\nAnother common modification of the four-cane Kniffin is that shown in\r\nfig. 24, in which a crotch or Y is made in the trunk. This crotch is\r\nused in the belief that the necessary sap supply is thereby more readily\r\ndeflected into the lower arms than by the system of side spurring on a\r\nstraight or continuous trunk. This is probably a fallacy, and may have\r\narisen from the attempt to grow as heavy canes on the lower wire as on\r\nthe upper one. Nevertheless, this modification is in common use in\r\nwestern New York and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24. THE Y-TRUNK KNIFFIN.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to leave an equal number of buds on both wires, the\r\nDouble Kniffin will probably be found most satisfactory. Two distinct\r\ntrunks are brought from the root, each supplying a single wire only. The\r\ntrunks are tied together to hold them in place. This system, under the\r\nname of Improved Kniffin, is just coming into notice in restricted\r\nportions of the Hudson valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Two-Cane Kniffin, or Umbrella System._--Inasmuch as the greater\r\npart of the fruit in the Four-Cane Kniffin is born upon the upper wire,\r\nthe question arises if it would not be better to dispense with the\r\nlower canes and cut the upper ones longer. This is now done to a\r\nconsiderable extent, especially in the Hudson valley. Fig. 25 explains\r\nthe operation. This shows a pruned vine. The trunk is tied to the lower\r\nwire to steady it, and two canes, each bearing from nine to fifteen\r\nbuds, are left upon the upper wire. These canes are tied to the upper\r\nwire and they are then bent down, hoop-like, to the lower wire, where\r\nthe ends are tied. In some instances, the lower wire is dispensed with,\r\nbut this is not advisable. This wire holds the vine in place against the\r\nwinds and prevents the too violent whipping of the hanging shoots.\r\nDuring the growing season, renewal canes are taken from the spurs in\r\nexactly the same manner as in the ordinary Kniffin. This species of\r\ntraining reduces the amount of leaf-surface to a minimum, and every\r\nprecaution must be taken to insure a healthy leaf-growth. This system\r\nof training will probably not allow of the successful girdling of the\r\nvine for the purpose of hastening the maturity and augmenting the size\r\nof the fruit. Yet heavy crops can be obtained from it, if liberal\r\nfertilizing and good cultivation are employed, and the fruit is nearly\r\nalways first-class. A Concord vine trained in this manner produced in\r\n1892 eighty clusters of first quality grapes, weighing forty pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25. UMBRELLA TRAINING.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of Umbrella training is shown in fig. 26, before pruning.\r\nHere five main canes were allowed to grow, instead of two. Except in\r\nvery strong vines, this top is too heavy, and it is probably never so\r\ngood as the other (fig. 25), if the highest results are desired; but for\r\nthe grower who does not care to insure high cultivation it is probably a\r\nsafer system than the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 26. A POOR UMBRELLA SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Low, or One-Wire Kniffin._--A modification of this Umbrella system\r\nis sometimes used, in which the trellis is only three or four feet high\r\nand comprises but a single wire. A cane of ten or a dozen buds is tied\r\nout in each direction, and the shoots are allowed to hang in essentially\r\nthe same manner as in the True or High Kniffin system. The advantages\r\nurged for this system are the protection of the grapes from wind, the\r\nlarge size of the fruit due to the small amount of bearing wood, the\r\nease of laying down the vines, the readiness with which the top can be\r\nrenewed from the root as occasion demands, and the cheapness of the\r\ntrellis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Six-Cane Kniffin._--There are many old vineyards in eastern New\r\nYork which are trained upon a six-cane or three-wire system. The general\r\npruning and management of these vines do not differ from that of the\r\ncommon Kniffin. Very strong varieties which can carry an abundance of\r\nwood, may be profitable upon this style of training, but it cannot be\r\nrecommended. A Concord vineyard over thirty years old, comprising 295\r\nvines, trained in this fashion, is still thrifty and productive. Twice\r\nit has produced crops of six tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 27. EIGHT-CANE KNIFFIN. (Diagram.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eight-Cane Kniffin._--Eight and even ten canes are sometimes left upon\r\na single trunk, and are trained out horizontally or somewhat obliquely,\r\nas shown in the accompanying diagram (fig. 27). Unless these canes are\r\ncut back to four or five buds each, the vine carries too much wood and\r\nfruit. This system allows of close planting, but the trellis is too\r\nexpensive. The trunk soon becomes overgrown with spurs, and it is likely\r\nto become prematurely weak. This style is very rarely used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 28. OVERHEAD KNIFFIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 29. OVERHEAD KNIFFIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Overhead, or Arbor Kniffin._--A curious modification of the Kniffin is\r\nemployed somewhat on the Hudson, particularly by Sands Haviland at\r\nMarlboro'. The vines are carried up on a kind of overhead arbor, as\r\nshown in figs. 28, 29 and 30. The trellis is six feet above the ground,\r\nand is composed of three horizontal wires lying in the same plane. The\r\ncentral wire runs from post to post, and one upon either side is\r\nattached to the end of a three-foot cross-bar, as represented in fig.\r\n28. The rows are nine feet apart, and the vines and posts twelve feet\r\napart in the row. Contiguous rows are braced by a connecting-pole, as in\r\nfig. 29. The trunk of the vine ends in a T-shaped head, which is well\r\ndisplayed in the vine at the extreme right in the foreground in fig. 30.\r\nFrom this T-head, five canes are carried out from spurs. It was formerly\r\nthe practice to carry out six canes, one in each direction upon each\r\nwire, but this was found to supply too much wood. Now two canes are\r\ncarried in one direction and three in the other; and the positions of\r\nthese sets are alternated each year, if possible. The canes which are\r\nleft after the winter pruning are tied along the wires in spring, as in\r\nthe Kniffin, and the shoots hang over the wires. The chief advantage of\r\nthis training is that it allows of the growing of bush-fruits between\r\nthe rows, as seen in fig. 29. It is also said that the clusters hang so\r\nfree that the bloom is not injured by the twigs or leaves, and the fruit\r\nis protected from sun and frost. Every post must be large and firmly\r\nset, however, adding much to the cost of the trellis. Several styles\r\nsimilar to this are in use, one of the best being the Crittenden system,\r\nof Michigan. In this system, the trellis is low, not exceeding four or\r\nfive feet, and the vines cover a flat-topped platform two or three feet\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30. OVERHEAD KNIFFIN, BEFORE PRUNING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cross-Wire System._--Another high Kniffin training, and which is\r\nalso confined to the vicinity of Marlboro', New York, is the Cross-Wire,\r\nrepresented in figs. 31 and 32. Small posts are set eight feet apart\r\neach way, and a single wire runs from the top of post to post--six and\r\none-half feet from the ground--in each direction, forming a check-row\r\nsystem of overhead wires. The grape-vine is set at the foot of the\r\nstake, to which the trunk is tied for support. Four canes are taken from\r\nspurs on the head of the trunk, one for each of the radiating wires.\r\nThese canes are cut to three and one-half or four feet in length, and\r\nthe bearing shoots droop as they grow. Fig. 31 shows this training as it\r\nappears some time after the leaves start in spring. Later in the season\r\nthe whole vineyard becomes a great arbor, and a person standing at a\r\ndistance sees an almost impenetrable mass of herbage, as in fig. 32.\r\nThis system appears to have little merit, and will always remain local\r\nin application. It possesses the advantage of economy in construction of\r\nthe trellis, for very slender posts are used, even at the ends of the\r\nrows. The end posts are either braced by a pole or anchored by a wire\r\ntaken from the top and secured to a stake or stone eight or ten feet\r\nbeyond, outside the vineyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 31. CROSS-WIRE TRAINING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 32. CROSS-WIRE TRAINING. OUTSIDE VIEW.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Renewal Kniffin._--It is an easy matter to adapt the Kniffin principle\r\nof free hanging shoots to a true renewal method of pruning. There are a\r\nfew modifications in use in which the wood is annually renewed to near\r\nthe ground. The trellises comprise either two or three wires, and are\r\nmade in the same manner as for the upright systems, as the High Renewal.\r\nAt the annual pruning only one cane is left. This comprises twelve or\r\nfifteen buds, and is tied up diagonally across the trellis, the point or\r\nend of the cane usually being bent downward somewhat, in order to check\r\nthe strong growth from the uppermost parts. The shoots hang from this\r\ncane, and they may be pinched back when they reach the ground. In the\r\nmeantime a strong shoot is taken out from the opposite side of the\r\nhead--which usually stands a foot or less from the ground--to make the\r\nbearing wood of the next year; and this new cane will be tied in an\r\nopposite direction on the trellis from the present bearing cane, and the\r\nnext renewal shoot will be taken from the other side of the head, or the\r\nside from which the present bearing wood sprung; so that the bearing top\r\nof the vine is alternated in either direction upon the trellis. This\r\nsystem, and similar ones, allow of laying down the vines easily in\r\nwinter, and insure excellent fruit because the amount of bearing wood\r\nis small; but the crop is not large enough to satisfy most demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Munson System._--An unique system of training, upon the Kniffin\r\nprinciple, has been devised by T. V. Munson, of Denison, Texas, a\r\nwell-known authority upon grapes. Two posts are set in the same hole,\r\ntheir tops diverging. A wire is stretched along the top of these posts\r\nand a third one is hung between them on cross-wires. The trunk of the\r\nvine, or its head, is secured to this middle lower wire and the shoots\r\nlop over the side wires. The growth, therefore, makes a V-shaped or\r\ntrough-like mass of herbage. Fig. 33 is an end view of this trellis,\r\nshowing the short wire connecting the posts and which also holds the\r\nmiddle trellis-wire at the point of the V. Fig. 34 is a side view of the\r\ntrellis. The bearing canes, two or four, in number, which are left after\r\nthe annual pruning, are tied along this middle wire. The main trunk\r\nforks just under the middle wire, as seen at the left in fig. 34. A head\r\nis formed at this place not unlike like that which characterizes the\r\nHigh Renewal, for this system also employs renewal pruning. The trellis\r\nstands six feet high. The shoots stand upright at first, but soon fall\r\ndown and are supported by the side wires. The following account of this\r\nsystem of training is written for this occasion by Mr. Munson:\r\n\r\n\"After the vines have flowered, the bearing laterals have their tips\r\npinched off, and that is all the summer pruning the vine gets, except to\r\nrub off all eyes that start on the body below the crotch. Two to four\r\nshoots, according to strength of vine, are started from the forks or\r\ncrotch and allowed to bear no fruit, but are trained along over the\r\nlower central wire for renewal canes. When pruning time arrives, the\r\nentire bearing cane of the present year, with all its laterals, is cut\r\naway at a point near where the young renewal shoots have started, and\r\nthese shoots are shortened back, according to strength of vine; some,\r\nsuch as Herbemont, being able at four years to fill four shoots six or\r\neight feet long with fine fruit, while Delaware could not well carry\r\nover three or four feet each way of one shoot only. The different\r\nvarieties are set at various distances apart, according as they are\r\nstrong or weak growers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 33. MUNSON TRAINING. END VIEW.]\r\n\r\n\"Thus the trellis and system of pruning are reduced to the simplest\r\nform. A few cuts to each vine cover all the pruning, and a few ties\r\ncomplete the task. A novice can soon learn to do the work well. The\r\ntrunk or main stem is secured to the middle lower wire, along which all\r\nbearing canes are tied after pruning, and from which the young laterals\r\nwhich produce the crop are to spring. These laterals strike the two\r\nouter wires, soon clinging to them with their tendrils, and are safe\r\nfrom destruction, while the fruit is thrown in the best possible\r\nposition for spraying and gathering, and is still shaded with the canopy\r\nof leaves. I have now used this trellis five years upon ten acres of\r\nmixed vines, and I am more pleased with it every year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 34. MUNSON TRAINING. SIDE VIEW.]\r\n\r\n\"The following advantages are secured by this system:\r\n\r\n\"1. The natural habit of the vine is maintained, which is a canopy to\r\nshade the roots and body of vine and the fruit, without smothering.\r\n\r\n\"2. New wood, formed by sap which has never passed through bearing wood,\r\nis secured for the next crop--a very important matter.\r\n\r\n\"3. Simplicity and convenience of trellis, allowing free passage in any\r\ndirection through the vineyard; circulation of air without danger of\r\nbreaking tender shoots; ease of pruning, spraying, cultivation,\r\nharvesting.\r\n\r\n\"4. Perfect control in pruning of amount of crop to suit capacity of\r\nvine.\r\n\r\n\"5. Long canes for bearing, which agrees exactly with the nature of\r\nnearly all our American species far better than short spurs.\r\n\r\n\"6. Ease of laying down in winter. The vine being pruned and not tied,\r\nstanding away from posts, can be bent down to one side between the rows,\r\nand earth thrown upon it, and can be quickly raised and tied in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\"7. Cheapness of construction and ease of removing trellis material and\r\nusing it again.\r\n\r\n\"8. Durability of both trellis and vineyard.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Drawing of grapes)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Training._--There are very few types of horizontal shoot\r\ntraining now in use. The best is probably that shown in fig. 35. This\r\nparticular vine is a Delaware, to which this training is well adapted.\r\nIt will be noticed that this picture represents the end of a trellis,\r\nand the diagonal stick seen near the ground is a brace for the end post.\r\nTwo wires run from post to post, one about two and one-half feet above\r\nthe ground and the other five and one-half feet high. The posts are set\r\nat the ordinary distance of 16 or 18 feet apart. The vines are set six\r\nor eight feet apart, if Delawares. A strong stake is driven in the\r\nground behind each vine, standing as high as the top of the trellis when\r\nset. The permanent trunk or head of the vine stands about a foot high.\r\nThe vine is renewed back to the top of this trunk every year. One cane\r\nis left at each pruning, which, when tied up to the stake, is as high as\r\nthe trellis. From this perpendicular cane, the bearing shoots are\r\ncarried out horizontally. About six of these shoots are allowed to grow\r\nupon either side of the cane. As the shoots grow, they are tied to\r\nperpendicular slats which are fastened on the wires. These slats do not\r\ntouch the ground. Two slats are provided upon either side, making four\r\nto a vine. They stand a foot or fifteen inches apart. The clusters hang\r\nfree from the horizontal shoots. If the shoots grow too long, they are\r\npinched in when they have passed the second slat. While these shoots are\r\ncovering the trellis, another shoot is taken out from the head or trunk\r\nof the vine and, without being allowed to fruit, is tied up along the\r\ncentral stake. This shoot is to form the top next year, for all the\r\npresent vine is to be entirely cut away at the winter's pruning. So the\r\nvine starts every spring with but a single cane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 35. HORIZONTAL TRAINING.]\r\n\r\nExcellent results are obtained from the slender growing varieties by\r\nthis method of training, but it is too expensive in trellis and in labor\r\nof tying to make it generally practicable. Delaware, however, thrives\r\nremarkably well when trained in this fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Post Training._--There are various methods of training to posts, all of\r\nwhich possess two advantages--the saving of the expense of trellis and\r\nallowing of cultivation both ways. But they also have grave\r\ndisadvantages, especially in the thickness of the head of foliage which\r\nharbors rot and mildew and prevents successful spraying, and hinders the\r\nfruit from coloring and ripening well. These faults are so serious that\r\npost training is now little used for the American grapes. The saving in\r\ncost of trellis is not great, for more posts are required to the acre\r\nthan in the trellis systems, and they do not endure long when standing\r\nalone with the whole weight of the vines thrown upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 36. LOW POST TRAINING.]\r\n\r\nThere are various methods of pruning for the stake training, but nearly\r\nall of them agree in pruning to side spurs upon a permanent upright arm\r\nwhich stands the full height of the vine. There may be one or two sets\r\nof these spurs. We might suppose the Kniffin vine, shown in fig. 22, to\r\nbe tied to a post instead of stretched on a trellis; in that event,\r\nthe four canes would hang at will, or they might be wrapped about the\r\npost, the shoots hanging out unsupported in all directions. The post\r\nsystems are essentially Kniffin in principle, for the shoots hang free.\r\nIn low styles of post training, the permanent head of the vine may be\r\nonly three or four feet high. This head will have a ring of spurs on it,\r\nand at the annual pruning three to five canes with from six to ten buds\r\neach are left. Fig. 36 is a view in such a post vineyard.\r\n\r\nThe main trunk is usually tied permanently to the post. The canes left\r\nafter pruning are variously disposed. Sometimes they are bent upwards\r\nand tied to the post above the head of the vine, but they are oftenest\r\neither wound loosely about the post, or are allowed to hang loose. Two\r\ntrunks are frequently used to each post, both coming from the ground\r\nfrom a common root. These are wound about the post in opposite\r\ndirections, one outside the other, and if the outside one is secured at\r\nthe top by a small nail driven through it, or by a cord, no other tying\r\nwill be necessary. Sometimes two or three posts are set at distances of\r\none foot or more apart, and the vines are wrapped about them, but this\r\nonly augments the size and depth of the mass of foliage. Now and then\r\none sees a careful post training, in which but little wood is left and\r\nvigorous breaking out of shoots practiced, which gives excellent\r\nresults; but on the whole, it cannot be recommended. The European post\r\nand stake systems or modifications of them, are yet occasionally\r\nrecommended for American vines, but under general conditions, especially\r\nin commercial grape growing, they rarely succeed long. One of the latest\r\nrecommendations of any of these types is that of the single pole system\r\nof the Upper Rhine Valley, by A. F. Hofer, of Iowa, in a little treatise\r\npublished in 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arbors._--Arbors and bowers are usually formed with little reference to\r\npruning and training. The first object is to secure shade and seclusion,\r\nand these are conditions which may seriously interfere with the\r\nproduction of fine grapes. As a rule, too much wood must be allowed to\r\ngrow, and the soil about arbors is rarely ever cultivated. Still, fair\r\nresults in fruit can be obtained if the operator makes a diligent use of\r\nthe pruning shears. It is usually best to carry one main or permanent\r\ntrunk up to the top or center of the arbor. Along this trunk at\r\nintervals of two feet or less, spurs may be left to which the wood is\r\nrenewed each year. If the vines stand six feet apart about the\r\narbor--which is a satisfactory distance--one cane three feet long may be\r\nleft on each spur when the pruning is done. The shoots which spring from\r\nthese canes will soon cover up the intermediate spaces. At the close of\r\nthe season, this entire cane with its laterals is cut away at the spur,\r\nand another three-foot cane--which grew during the season--is left in\r\nits place. This pruning is essentially that of the Kniffin vine in fig.\r\n22. Imagine this vine, with as many joints or tiers as necessary, laid\r\nupon the arbor. The canes are tied out horizontally to the slats instead\r\nof being tied on wires. This same system--running up a long trunk and\r\ncutting in to side spurs--will apply equally well to tall walls and\r\nfences which it is desired to cover. Undoubtedly a better plan, so far\r\nas yield and quality of fruit is concerned, is to renew back nearly to\r\nthe root, bringing up a strong new cane, or perhaps two or three every\r\nyear, and cutting the old ones off; but as the vines are desired for\r\nshade one does not care to wait until midsummer for the vines to reach\r\nand cover the top of the arbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remodeling Old Vines._--Old and neglected tops can rarely be remodeled\r\nto advantage. If the vine is still vigorous, it will probably pay to\r\ngrow an entirely new top by taking out a cane from the root. If the old\r\ntop is cut back severely for a year or two, this new cane will make a\r\nvigorous growth, and it can be treated essentially like a new or young\r\nvine. If it is very strong and ripens up well, it can be left long\r\nenough the first fall to make the permanent trunk; but if it is rather\r\nweak and soft, it should be cut back in the fall or winter to two or\r\nthree buds, from one of which the permanent trunk is to be grown the\r\nsecond season. Thereafter, the instructions which are given in the\r\npreceding pages for the various systems, will apply to the new vine.\r\nThe old trunk should be cut away as soon as the new one is permanently\r\ntied to the wires, that is, at the close of either the first or second\r\nseason of the new trunk. Care must be exercised to rub off all sprouts\r\nwhich spring from the old root or stump. If this stump can be cut back\r\ninto the ground and covered with earth, better results may be expected.\r\nOld vines treated in this manner often make good plants, but if the\r\nvines are weak and the soil is poor, the trouble will scarcely pay for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThese old vines can be remodeled easily by means of grafting. Cut off\r\nthe trunk five or six inches below the surface of the ground, leaving an\r\ninch or two of straight wood above the roots. Into this stub insert two\r\ncions exactly as for cleft-grafting the apple. Cions of two or three\r\nbuds, of firm wood the size of a lead-pencil, should be inserted. The\r\ntop bud should stand above the ground. The cleft will need no tying nor\r\nwax, although it is well to place a bit of waxed cloth or other material\r\nover the wound to keep the soil out of it. Fill the earth tightly about\r\nit. Fig. 37 shows the first year's growth from two cions of Niagara set\r\nin a Red Wyoming root. Great care must be taken in any pruning which is\r\ndone this first year, or the cions may be loosened. If the young shoots\r\nare tied to a stake there will be less danger from wind and careless\r\nworkmen. In the vine shown in the illustration, no pruning nor rubbing\r\nout was done, but the vine would have been in better shape for\r\ntraining if only one or two shoots had been allowed to grow. Such a vine\r\nas this can be carried onto the trellis next year; or it may be cut back\r\nto three or four buds, one of which is allowed to make the permanent\r\ntrunk next year, like a two-year set vine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 37. A YEARLING GRAFT.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired, however, to keep the old top, it will be best to cut\r\nback the annual growth heavily at the winter pruning. The amount of wood\r\nwhich shall be left must be determined by the vigor of the plant and the\r\nvariety, but three or four canes of six to ten buds each may be left at\r\nsuitable places. During the next season a strong shoot from the base of\r\neach cane may be allowed to grow, which shall form the wood of the\r\nfollowing season, while all the present cane is cut away at the end of\r\nthe year. So the bearing wood is renewed each year, as in the regular\r\nsystems of training. Much skill and experience are often required to\r\nproperly rejuvenate an old vine; and in very many cases the vine is not\r\nworth the trouble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Drawing of grapes}]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Page\r\n\r\n  Adlum, quoted, 10\r\n\r\n  Arbor Kniffin, 72\r\n\r\n  Arbors, 88\r\n\r\n  Arm, defined, 13\r\n\r\n\r\n  Barns, W.

H. BAILEY. A complete handbook of Propagation\r\nand Pollination of Plants. _Profusely illustrated._ This valuable little\r\nmanual has been compiled with great pains. The author has had unusual\r\nfacilities for its preparation, having been aided by many experts. The\r\nbook is absolutely devoid of theory and speculation. It has nothing to\r\ndo with plant physiology or abstruse reasoning about plant growth. It\r\nsimply tells, plainly and briefly, what every one who sows a seed, makes\r\na cutting, sets a graft, or crosses a flower wants to know. It is\r\nentirely new and original in method and matter. The cuts number 107, and\r\nare made expressly for it, direct from nature. The book treats all kinds\r\nof cultivated plants, fruits, vegetables, greenhouse plants, hardy\r\nherbs, ornamental trees, shrubs and forest trees.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS:\r\n\r\nI.--SEEDAGE. On Propagation by Seed.\r\n\r\nII.--SEPARATION.\r\n\r\nIII.--LAYERAGE. Propagation by Layering.\r\n\r\nIV.--CUTTAGE. Propagation by Cuttings.\r\n\r\nV.--GRAFTAGE.--Including Grafting, Budding, Inarching, etc.\r\n\r\nVI.--NURSERY LIST.--This is the great feature of the book. It is an\r\nalphabetical list of all kinds of plants, with a short statement telling\r\nwhich of the operations described in the first five chapters are\r\nemployed in propagating them. _Over 2,000 entries_ are made in the list.\r\nThe following entries will give an idea of the method:\r\n\r\n=Acer= (MAPLE). _Sapindaceae._ Stocks are grown from stratified seeds,\r\nwhich should be sown an inch or two deep; or some species, as _A.\r\ndasycarpum_, come readily if seeds are sown as soon as ripe. Some\r\ncultural varieties are layered, but better plants are obtained by\r\ngrafting. Varieties of native species are worked upon common or native\r\nstocks. The Japanese sorts are winter-worked upon imported _A.\r\npolymorphum_ stocks, either by whip or veneer grafting. Maples can also\r\nbe budded in summer, and they grow readily from cuttings of both ripe\r\nand soft wood.\r\n\r\n=Phyllocactus, Phyllocereus, Disocactus= (LEAF CACTUS). _Cacteae._ Fresh\r\nseeds grow readily. Sow in rather sandy soil which is well drained, and\r\napply water as for common seeds. When the seedlings appear, remove to a\r\nlight position. Cuttings from mature shoots, three to six inches in\r\nlength, root readily in sharp sand. Give a temperature of about 60 deg., and\r\napply only sufficient water to keep from flagging. If the cuttings are\r\nvery juicy they may be laid on dry sand for several days before\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\nVII.--POLLINATION.\r\n\r\nPrice, in Library Style, cloth, wide margins, $1 Pocket Style, paper,\r\nnarrow margins, 50 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODIFICATION OF PLANTS BY CLIMATE.--By A.
