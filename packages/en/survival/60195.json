TABER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOSTON:\r\n  GEO. H. ELLIS, 141 FRANKLIN STREET.\r\n  1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1896.\r\n  BY C. A. M. TABER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GEO. H. ELLIS, PRINTER, 141 FRANKLIN STREET, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe explanations given in the following pages, in which I have sought\r\nto show the manner in which an ice age is being brought about, is an\r\nextension of a treatise on “The Cause of Warm and Frigid Periods,”\r\nwhich I published in a small edition in 1894. And, from the small\r\nnumber of copies circulated, only a few came to the hands of persons\r\nparticularly interested in such matter. Yet there were instances of\r\nits having proved of special interest to persons celebrated for their\r\ngeological attainments, and also to instructors in physical geography.\r\nBesides, it received considerate notice in some of the leading reviews.\r\nBeing thus somewhat encouraged, and thinking that the subject was too\r\nimportant to be neglected, I have given it further study during the\r\nlast year, and meanwhile have obtained additional information from\r\nrecent discoveries which has served to corroborate my views. Hence I\r\nhave been able to be more explicit in my explanations in the present\r\nvolume than in my earlier writings. Still, while acting as a pioneer in\r\nthe matter, it will be seen that I have only attempted to expose the\r\nmain outlines, as my age and failing health will not permit me to enter\r\ninto the voluminous details necessary for a full explanation. In order\r\nto show why my attention has been turned to the great climatic changes\r\nwhich have taken place during past ages, and now threaten the future, I\r\nwill repeat the introduction of my earlier publication, wherein I wrote\r\nthat “the reason why I have undertaken to explain the causes which have\r\nbrought about the warm and cold epochs is because of my being unable\r\nto harmonize the several theories that have been published with the\r\ngeneral mode of action which nature pursues to-day. Having in the early\r\npart of my life been employed for a score of years in the whaling\r\nservice, during which time my sea voyages were passed in cruising over\r\nthe North and South Atlantic, and over the Indian Ocean, from latitudes\r\nnorth of the equator to the southern shores of Kerguelen Land, and\r\nalong the seas of Southern Australia, I also, in my searching, cruised\r\nover the Pacific Ocean from the icy seas south of Cape Horn to the\r\nnorthern latitudes of Alaska, and, from New Zealand in the Western\r\nPacific to the numerous islands in the tropical zone. And it may be\r\nsaid that among the chief things to be learned on such voyages was the\r\ndirection of the prevailing winds and surface currents of the sea. Thus\r\nthe impressions then received were in mind when, in after years, I had\r\nmy attention drawn to the several theories advanced for explaining the\r\ncauses which produced the warm and frigid epochs. But, so far as my\r\nmarine experience goes, such theories have not harmonized with nature’s\r\nmode of operating at this age of the world. Therefore, I have conceived\r\nviews which, to my mind, are more agreeable to the simple operations of\r\nnature of which I have long been witness. Consequently, I have written\r\nseveral short essays on climatic changes since 1880, and also letters\r\nrelating to the same subject, which have been published in _Science_\r\nand _Scientific American_. But the space allowed for the introduction of\r\nsuch matter was necessarily too limited for so wide an explanation as\r\nthe subject required. The views then advanced I have again repeated,\r\nwith the addition of several facts pertaining to physical geography,\r\nwhich, so far as I know, have never before been published.”\r\n\r\n  WAKEFIELD, MASS., U.S.A.\r\n        June, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n    CAUSE OF COLD AND MILD PERIODS,                                 9–36\r\n\r\n    Traces of ancient glaciers in temperate zones, 9;\r\n        prevailing winds the main cause of the circulation of\r\n        the ocean waters between the tropical and temperate\r\n        zones, 10;

for it is\r\nreported that ice-sheets have left unmistakable marks of having overrun\r\nthe greater part of the lands lying between the arctic seas and the\r\nlatitude of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nIn Asia evidences of glacial action have been noticed from Northern\r\nSiberia to the mountains of Syria.\r\n\r\nThe great glaciers of Himalaya have in times past attained gigantic\r\nproportions. In Northern China huge bowlders are found scattered over\r\nthe valleys, and a long distance from the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe southern hemisphere, in proportion to the extent of its land\r\nsurface, shows ample traces of former ice action. From the latitude of\r\n38° south to the southern extremity of the western continent there is\r\nsaid to be the clearest evidence of former glacial action in numerous\r\nbowlders scattered over the land.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of the South Pacific, from the Island of Chiloe to\r\nCape Horn, the coast is fringed with deep fiords, which appear to be\r\nchannelled out by ice, like the fiords of Norway and Greenland. And at\r\nthis date the mountains of that southern region are covered with snow,\r\nand the glaciers which flow down the valleys are said to reach the\r\ntide-water as far north as the latitude of 47° south. The glaciers of\r\nNew Zealand, now of Alpine proportions, during the ice age descended\r\nto the sea, and channelled the deep fiords on its south-western coast;\r\nand certain traces of glacial action have been observed in Southern\r\nAustralia, and also in the province of Natal, South Africa.\r\n\r\nKerguelen Land is pierced with deep, narrow fiords, which have the\r\nappearance of having been the work of ancient glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe lands south of the antarctic circle are to-day supposed to be\r\ncovered by an ice-sheet, of which the great ice barrier surrounding\r\nthat region furnishes ample proof.\r\n\r\nWhile impressed with the above reports of the work of ancient\r\nglaciers, in connection with my own observations along the shores of\r\nthe several oceans, I have been led to seek for the physical causes\r\nwhich brought about the great climatic changes of past geological\r\nages. And, while having the subject under consideration, I have had my\r\nattention directed to the manner in which the great prevailing winds in\r\nconnection with continental lands are able to move the heated surface\r\nwaters of the tropical oceans into the colder zones, and also transfer\r\nthe cold waters of the higher latitudes into the tropical zones.\r\n\r\nAnd it is through this grand movement of the ocean waters that we are\r\nenabled to account for the difference in the temperature of places now\r\nlying in the same parallels of latitude.\r\n\r\nThe natural methods for conveying tropical heat into the higher\r\nlatitudes, and also for excluding it therefrom, are so simple and\r\nefficient that on due consideration we are able to conceive how epochs\r\npossessing mild climates have been succeeded by periods of frigidity.\r\n\r\nIt has been admitted by several writers on climatic changes that,\r\nshould the tropical surface waters of the ocean be moved into the\r\nhigh latitudes in large volume, thus adding their warmth to the heat\r\nimparted by the sun, such combined heat would cause a mild climate.\r\nAnd it has been estimated that the amount of equatorial heat moved\r\ninto the temperate and polar regions of the northern hemisphere by\r\nthe Gulf Stream alone is equal to one-fourth of all the heat received\r\nfrom the sun by the North Atlantic from the tropic of Cancer to the\r\narctic circle. Still, it appears to me, while viewing the subject from\r\na marine standpoint, that the explainers of climatic changes have never\r\nfully comprehended the manner in which the surface waters of the ocean\r\nare moved from the tropics into the high latitudes, and returned from\r\nthe high latitudes to the tropics. Consequently, they have neglected\r\nnecessary and efficient natural agents in their explanatory theories,\r\nand with much learning and ingenuity have laboriously sought to show\r\nhow great changes of climate could be brought about through other\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nBut when we notice the simple methods employed by nature to-day for\r\ntransferring the heat of the tropics into the higher latitudes, and\r\nalso the manner of excluding such heat therefrom, they appear to afford\r\nan explanation for the great changes of climate which have taken place\r\nduring past ages; for it appears that the natural manner of proceeding\r\nby which heat is moved from the torrid zone into the high latitudes\r\nsufficient to cause a mild climate is through the ocean currents which\r\nare constantly set in motion by the great prevailing winds of the\r\nglobe. These winds, as is well known, blow mostly from the east toward\r\nthe west in the tropics, and from the west toward the east in the high\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\nThis counter-movement of the winds, in connection with a continent\r\nextending both northward and southward from the equator over many\r\ndegrees of latitude, such as obtains on the western continent, is\r\nabundantly able to create extensive depressions and elevations on\r\nthe ocean’s surface, and thus cause vast streams of water to move by\r\ngravity from the high sea-levels to the low sea-levels; and in this\r\nway the tropical waters have been moved during past ages, and to a\r\nconsiderable extent are now moved far into the northern and southern\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThis transfer of the ocean waters is the main cause of a temperate\r\nclimate being enjoyed by countries situated in the high latitudes at\r\nthis age.\r\n\r\nBut, in order that the tropical currents should be able to flow into\r\nthe high latitudes, in quantities sufficient to cause all lands and\r\nseas situated in such latitudes to enjoy a mild climate, it would be\r\nnecessary that the land should extend unbroken, or nearly so, from\r\nthe arctic to the antarctic circles. Thus, with a continent of such\r\nvast extent, the westerly winds would blow the surface waters of the\r\nocean away from the eastern shores in the high latitudes, and so cause\r\nextensive low sea-levels; while the easterly winds of the torrid zone\r\nwould heap the surface waters of the ocean against the eastern tropical\r\nshores of the continent. Consequently, the warm waters of the tropical\r\nhigh sea-level would be moved by gravity to the low sea-levels of the\r\nhigh latitudes, even to the arctic and antarctic regions, and thus\r\nafford them a mild climate. In this way we account for the mild climate\r\nenjoyed on lands and seas within the high latitudes during the warm\r\nepochs anterior to the glacial periods.\r\n\r\nAs the western continent is the only land that extends unbroken from\r\nthe equator to the cold latitudes of both hemispheres, thus affording\r\nan opportunity for the prevailing winds to move the tropical waters\r\ninto the high latitudes, I will call attention to that portion of the\r\ncontinent which extends far southward into the southern ocean, where\r\nthe winds and ocean currents have the greatest range and power to\r\naffect the climate on different parts of the globe. Here we see South\r\nAmerica separated from the antarctic continent by a wide channel of\r\ndeep water, where the westerly winds blow with great force. The space\r\nnow covered by this interesting channel, owing to its being situated in\r\nthe high southern latitudes, must have been occupied by a channel of\r\ncomparatively small capacity, or else an isthmus of low land uniting\r\nthe southern portion of South America with the antarctic continent\r\nduring the warm epochs when the beds of the ancient seas of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere contained a considerable portion of the water now\r\nswelling the southern ocean.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the obstructions which separated the Pacific Ocean from\r\nthe South Atlantic furnished opportunity for the westerly winds to\r\nforce the surface waters of the sea away from the leeward side of such\r\nobstructions, causing a vast low sea-level, sufficient to attract the\r\ntropical waters heaped against Brazil by the trade winds into the\r\nsouthern seas in adequate quantity to cause a mild climate throughout\r\nthe antarctic regions through long periods of time.\r\n\r\nRecent discoveries have proved that these high southern latitudes have\r\nbeen subject to great changes of climate. According to the reports\r\nfrom the Dundee whalers, while searching for seal in the icy seas that\r\nsurround the South Shetlands, they met with the Norwegian ship “Jason,”\r\nCaptain Larsen, who had traced the eastern shore of Graham Land to 68°\r\nsouth latitude, noting two active volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe same mariner brought from Seymour Island fossil shells and\r\nconiferous wood of the Tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nThese furnish sufficient evidence to show that a warmer climate once\r\nprevailed there.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the glacial age the obstructions which separated\r\nthe South Pacific from the South Atlantic had become deeply submerged\r\nby the sea, which may have been caused by a tendency of the ocean’s\r\nwaters to move southward or by a comparative small movement in the\r\nearth’s crust. But, on account of the stability of the crust of the\r\nearth during times so late as the glacial epochs, the submergence of\r\nthis southern region was probably owing to the movement of the ocean’s\r\nwaters from the northern hemisphere into the southern hemisphere,\r\nwhich appears to have been brought about mostly through the agency of\r\nthe great prevailing winds; for it seems to have happened that the\r\nprevailing winds on account of the disposition of the lands and seas\r\nwere able to move more of the ocean waters southward than they moved\r\nnorthward during the age preceding the glacial periods. The waters\r\nthus slowly and gradually forced into the high southern latitudes\r\nmust have deprived the northern hemisphere of their heaviness, and\r\nadded their weight to the southern hemisphere. Therefore, the waters\r\nmoved southward could not all be returned to the seas of the northern\r\nhemisphere by gravity, for the reason that the earth’s centre of\r\nattraction would change in accordance with the weight of water moved\r\nfrom the northern hemisphere into the southern. It will thus be seen\r\nthat, while the northern seas were drained or became shallow, the\r\naugmented southern oceans deeply submerged the region south of Cape\r\nHorn, thus widely separating the western continent from the antarctic\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nAlthough the south-east trade winds on the eastern sides of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans extend further northward than the\r\nnorth-east trade winds extend southward, owing to the heated tropical\r\nshores north of the equator being more extensive than such lands\r\nsouth of the equator, still, on account of the general weakness of\r\nthe south-east trade winds at the equator, and also because of the\r\nobstructing northern lands, they have during remote times, and at this\r\nage, been largely prevented from impelling the surface waters of the\r\nsea into the northern latitudes in opposition to the brisk north-east\r\ntrades. Furthermore, on account of the widening of the oceans as they\r\nextend southward, the surface currents setting in the latter direction\r\nhave more broad and easy passages than the great currents setting\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the great currents setting southward on the western sides\r\nof the oceans south of the equator are also much assisted during the\r\nsouthern summer months by the strong north-east monsoons which prevail\r\nalong the east coast of equatorial Africa and the east coast of South\r\nAmerica as far as the latitude of 30° south.\r\n\r\nThe South African current is impelled northward by the trade winds down\r\nthe south-western coast of Africa; but it is debarred from entering\r\nthe northern latitudes by the Guinea currents, and so turned away into\r\nthe south equatorial current which flows into the Brazilian stream.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream is much obstructed in its northern movement by the\r\nnarrow Florida channel and the opposing arctic currents, and also\r\nby the trend of the North American coast eastward; while its return\r\ncurrent on the eastern side of the Atlantic has a much less obstructed\r\npassage in its southern movement, and, while on its way past the Azores\r\nand Madeira Islands, is largely assisted by the prevailing winds.\r\n\r\nThe Brazil current, with the impelling force of a strong north-east\r\nmonsoon during the summer season, has no obstruction whatever in its\r\nsouthern passage until it meets with an offshoot from the great drift\r\ncurrent of the southern ocean.\r\n\r\nAnd the same favorable conditions are obtained by the great currents\r\nsetting southward on the western sides of the South Pacific while on\r\ntheir way to the low sea-levels east of Southern Australia and New\r\nZealand. That portion of the equatorial stream of the Pacific which\r\ncontinues west across the Indian Ocean finds no open passage to the\r\nnorthern seas. Consequently, it turns south along the east coast of\r\nAfrica into the southern seas.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this current, in connection with the great currents setting\r\nsouthward east of Australia, offsets the great Humboldt current setting\r\nnorth along the coast of Peru.\r\n\r\nIn the North Pacific the Japanese current setting northward is\r\nobstructed by the narrowing of the ocean; while its return current\r\non the American side has a constantly widening ocean on its passage\r\nsouthward, and also favorable winds to impel the surface waters toward\r\nthe equator. Still, with all the facilities above mentioned for the\r\nmovement of the ocean waters into the southern latitudes, it is\r\nprobable that since the shallow seas of the northern hemisphere were\r\ndrained, or much diminished, the prevailing winds have not possessed\r\nsufficient force to further augment the southern seas, because of the\r\nsuperior weight of the land in the northern hemisphere compared with\r\nthe lands south of the equator.\r\n\r\nIt will appear to those who attribute the rotation of the earth as\r\nbeing the main cause of ocean currents that I am too much given\r\nover to the wind theory. But I have reason to believe, as Dr. Croll\r\nhas asserted, that “the winds are the principal cause of the ocean\r\ncurrents, and are not due to the trade winds alone, but to the general\r\nimpulse of the prevailing winds of the globe.”\r\n\r\nDr. Croll also declares that “all of the principal currents of the\r\nglobe are moving in the exact direction which they ought to move,\r\nassuming the winds to be the sole impelling cause.”\r\n\r\nThose who think that the rotation of the earth is the real cause of\r\nthe movement of the great surface currents of the sea should explain\r\nin some reasonable way why the Agulhas current turns west into the\r\nAtlantic from the Mozambique stream, and why the Guinea current turns\r\nto the east from the main tropical current of the North Atlantic; for\r\nit seems that these two great currents move in direct opposition to the\r\nrotation theory, while at the same time many things go to show that\r\nthey receive their motion from the winds. This view of the question\r\nwill receive further attention in succeeding pages.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of some writers that a difference of temperature\r\nand density between the waters of the polar latitudes and the torrid\r\nzone is the principal cause of the movement of the surface waters of\r\nthe ocean from the equatorial latitudes toward the polar seas, and\r\nso returned in under-currents; and this is a favorable factor for\r\nassisting the winds on some parts of the sea, especially in aiding the\r\nBrazil current in moving the surface waters from the high sea-levels\r\nabreast Brazil, and the equatorial calm belt of the Atlantic into the\r\nsouthern ocean, and also for favoring the surface currents setting\r\nsouthward on the western sides of the South Pacific and Indian Oceans.\r\n\r\nYet, whatever gravitating force it may possess for assisting the\r\nabove-named currents, it would also act against the impelling force of\r\nthe trade winds, while they were drifting the surface waters northward\r\ntoward the equator on the eastern sides of the several oceans, and also\r\nto retard the returning surface currents, while being drifted by the\r\nwinds southward on the eastern sides of the North Atlantic and North\r\nPacific. Therefore, while it would seem to favor the winds in their\r\nwork on the one hand, it would act as an opposing agent on other parts\r\nof the ocean. Still, the difference of temperature between the tropical\r\nand antarctic seas probably does act in opposition to the wide and\r\nbrisk trade winds on the eastern sides of the great oceans south of the\r\nequator, and so prevents their impelling the surface waters northward\r\nto a great extent; and this seems to be one great cause of there being\r\nless surface water moved northward than southward over the greatest\r\noceans of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the difference of density caused by the difference\r\nof temperature between the polar seas and the equatorial oceans made\r\nunder-currents to flow from the polar latitudes, and meet in the\r\nequatorial seas, can only be carried on in the Atlantic Ocean, and in a\r\ncomparatively less perfect way in the Pacific Ocean, and not at all in\r\nthe Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe North Atlantic being open to the Arctic Ocean, a portion of the\r\nGulf Stream waters that enter it from the north-west of Europe do sink\r\nand return southward in under-currents; and the cold waters which pass\r\ndown the east and west coast of Greenland also sink under the Gulf\r\nStream while on their southern movement. The meeting of these arctic\r\ncurrents with the cold under-currents from the antarctic seas in the\r\ntropical zone is probably one cause of their cold waters rising near\r\nthe surface of the sea in the torrid latitudes of the Atlantic; and\r\nthe same conditions probably obtain in a somewhat less degree in the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nYet it appears that the cold waters of the Antarctic occupy the largest\r\nspace in the tropical zone, even in the North Atlantic. Dr. Carpenter,\r\nin his lectures on Ocean Currents, speaks of meeting with antarctic\r\nwater so far north as the latitudes of the West India Islands; and\r\nhe also says that all of the Pacific Ocean at its depths is supplied\r\nfrom the Antarctic Ocean, as are the cold under-waters of the tropical\r\nIndian Ocean, which extend over twenty degrees north of the equator.\r\n\r\nThus, from what we can learn of the antarctic under-currents, they seem\r\nto show that they are not wholly attracted northward on account of\r\nthe difference of temperature between the antarctic and the tropical\r\noceans, but partly because of more surface water being moved southward\r\nby the prevailing winds than they are able to move northward.\r\n\r\nAnd it appears that, if through the winds, combined with the difference\r\nof temperature between the antarctic seas and the equatorial waters,\r\nand also because of the oceans widening toward the south, more surface\r\nwater is being carried southward than northward, the waters of the\r\nunder-currents so caused must rise toward the surface in the latitudes\r\nfrom which they were first removed. Having called attention to the\r\nfact that the prevailing winds are not able at this date to augment\r\nthe southern ocean waters from the scanty northern seas, because of\r\nthe preponderance of northern lands, still there is reason to believe\r\nthat even now, owing to the form of continents and oceans, and the\r\nattraction of the tropical surface waters into the Antarctic Ocean\r\nbecause of the difference of density between the warm and cold seas,\r\nthe prevailing winds of this age are able to force more of the surface\r\nwaters of the sea southward than they force northward; but, owing to\r\nthe superior weight of the land in the northern hemisphere, the surplus\r\nsurface water forced into the southern seas is returned by gravity\r\nafter being cooled by the antarctic ice, and so adding to the deep\r\nunder-currents which flow with a sluggish movement over the bottom of\r\nthe sea into the tropical and northern temperate latitudes. And in this\r\nway the northern oceans are maintained at their present sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe cold under-currents are probably assisted in their northern\r\nmovement by whatever difference there may be in the density of the\r\nantarctic waters over the bottom waters of the equatorial seas. But,\r\nas such currents extend into the northern tropical latitudes of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, it seems that the winds are the main cause of the\r\nunder-currents which carry so much antarctic cold into the northern\r\ntropical seas, because the winds have forced an undue proportion\r\nof ocean surface water southward, to be attracted northward in\r\nunder-currents by the preponderating northern lands.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding the superior weight of land in the northern\r\nhemisphere, it appears that there have been periods when there was\r\nsomewhat more water in the oceans of the southern hemisphere than now;\r\nfor it is reported that a portion of the low lands of Australia show\r\ntraces of having been submerged during late geological times.\r\n\r\nThis may have happened through an increased weight in the antarctic\r\nglaciers, which have in past ages, and probably may in future epochs,\r\ncause more of the ocean waters to be attracted southward than now\r\nobtains. But it is probable that an increase of southern ice would be\r\nlargely counterbalanced by the accumulation of ice on northern lands.\r\n\r\nYet it appears certain that since the Tertiary epoch the waters of\r\nvast shallow seas have been moved from the northern hemisphere into\r\nthe southern. The dry beds of the ancient northern seas encourage this\r\nopinion, while the comparatively small area of southern lands serves to\r\nsupport such views.\r\n\r\nStill, during the ages prior to the glacial periods, while the low\r\nlands of the northern hemisphere were covered by the sea, the wide\r\nshoal channels which submerged the lower portion of North America\r\nafforded convenient passages for the surface waters of the ocean in\r\ntheir northern movement, and so prevented the oceans of the southern\r\nhemisphere from gaining undue preponderance.\r\n\r\nHence long geological ages passed away before the winds were able\r\nto force more of the ocean waters southward than they could move\r\nnorthward, and thus augment the southern ocean from the waters of the\r\nnorthern seas. But the slow growth of such immense marine deposits\r\nin the shallow seas as are found in the Florida Peninsula and other\r\nportions of that region was at length sufficient to greatly obstruct\r\nthe passage of the Gulf currents in their northern movement, and thus\r\ncause conditions which enabled the winds to force more of the ocean\r\nwaters southward than they could move northward after the close of the\r\nTertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred R. Wallace says in “Island Life” that the seas in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere during the Tertiary period covered a much larger\r\narea than now, and extended across Central Europe and portions of\r\nWestern Asia, and the Arctic Ocean was enlarged.\r\n\r\nAs it is not likely that any portion of the waters of the sea have been\r\nabsorbed by the earth during the late epochs in the world’s history,\r\ntherefore the ocean waters have not diminished except during cold\r\nperiods, when the water evaporated from the sea was converted into ice,\r\nand, eventually, again returned to the sea.\r\n\r\nThus it necessarily follows that, when the seas of the northern\r\nhemisphere contained a much larger portion of the waters of the globe\r\nthan at this age, the seas of the southern hemisphere must have\r\ncontained proportionally less. Consequently, during such times a\r\nportion of the shoal seas of the high southern latitudes must have been\r\ndry land. Therefore, this must have been the condition of the shallow\r\nsea basins in the region of Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace also says that “many peculiarities in the distribution of\r\nplants and some groups of animals in the southern hemisphere render it\r\nalmost certain that there has sometimes been a greater extension of\r\nantarctic lands during Tertiary times.”\r\n\r\nAnd he also asserts that the great ocean basins have not changed, and\r\nthat the form of continents has been permanent. It will thus be seen\r\nthat it was through the movement of the ocean’s waters southward that\r\nthe low lands south of Cape Horn were covered with water previous to\r\nthe frigid periods, and so caused the wide separation between the\r\nwestern continent and the antarctic lands.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Horn channel thus enlarged, the continuous mildness of the\r\nhigh southern latitudes which possessed the earlier ages came to an\r\nend, and gave place to alternate epochs of frigid and mild weather.\r\nFor it appears that it is owing to the creation or enlargement of the\r\nCape Horn channel that it is possible for frigid periods to be brought\r\nabout, for the reason that its enlarged space of water prevents the\r\nwesterly winds from maintaining a great low sea-level in the higher\r\nlatitudes of the southern ocean; for, whenever the capacity of the Cape\r\nHorn channel is enlarged, the westerly winds, instead of maintaining a\r\nlow sea-level on the South Atlantic, employ their force in impelling\r\nthe surface water of the southern seas around the globe. And this work\r\nthe strong westerly winds of the high southern latitudes have always\r\naccomplished whenever the Cape Horn channel was widely open, and this\r\nis what the winds are doing at this date.\r\n\r\nTherefore, such waters of the torrid zone as are moved southward from\r\ntheir high sea-level, caused by the trade winds abreast the Brazilian\r\ncoast, are largely turned away from the high southern latitudes. It is\r\ntrue, even with an enlarged Cape Horn channel, they can always flow\r\nalong the South American coast to an inferior low sea-level, caused by\r\nthe westerly winds blowing the surface waters of the sea away from the\r\ncoast of Argentine and Patagonia; but on gaining that region they meet\r\nthe cold ice-bearing currents which turn away east of Cape Horn from\r\nthe great southern drift current to gain the same low sea-level which\r\nattracts the Brazil water. Consequently, the ice-bearing currents from\r\nthe south, which branch off from the great southern drift current, are\r\nable to largely turn away the warm Brazil current from the higher\r\nsouthern latitudes; and, furthermore, the great southern drift current\r\nwhich passes through the Cape Horn channel, and so onward around the\r\nglobe, also partly turns away the Mozambique current as well as the\r\nEast Australian current, and so largely prevents their waters from\r\nwarming the southern seas.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is evident that, whenever the Cape Horn channel obtains\r\nsufficient capacity to give an independent circulation to the southern\r\nocean, the conditions are favorable for the increase of cold in the\r\nsouthern latitudes. For it is because of the large exclusion of the\r\ntropical waters from the southern seas that ice-sheets have been\r\nable to form in early periods and in later epochs on the antarctic\r\nlands, and store away the annual frosts for thousands of years, and\r\nat the same time furnish icebergs sufficient to chill the waters of\r\nthe southern temperate oceans, and consequently make cold such of the\r\nsurface waters of the sea as are forced into the southern latitudes by\r\nthe winds in surface currents, and so returned to warmer seas in cold\r\nunder-currents, and thus with such frigid combinations bring about cold\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThus it appears, as I have previously shown, that it is owing partly\r\nto there being more of the surface waters of the sea forced southward\r\nby the prevailing winds than they impel northward that the cold\r\nunder-currents are maintained; but it also requires an independent\r\ncirculation of the southern ocean, such as I have pointed out, to cool\r\nits surface waters before they can sink and form cold under-currents.\r\n\r\nAnd there is reason to believe that such cold under-currents are more\r\nefficient in lowering the temperature of the temperate and tropical\r\noceans than even the icebergs which such under-currents move into the\r\ntemperate seas. And, when it is considered that the cold antarctic\r\nunder-currents fill the depths of the Pacific and Indian Oceans in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and also largely the tropical depths of the North\r\nAtlantic, I am led to believe that the frigid conditions of the ice\r\nage were concurrent in the northern and southern hemispheres. The main\r\nreasons for such belief I will explain in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing explanations, showing how frigid periods are\r\nbrought about through the independent circulation of the southern ocean\r\nsurface waters, it is evident that, whenever through a slow natural\r\nprocess the Cape Horn channel is closed, a great change is wrought in\r\nthe circulation of the southern ocean.\r\n\r\nFor instead of the westerly winds blowing the surface waters of the\r\nsouthern seas constantly around the globe, and so turning away and\r\npreventing the entrance of the tropical currents into the high southern\r\nlatitudes, the strong westerly winds, whenever the Cape Horn channel\r\nis closed or greatly obstructed, would blow the surface waters away\r\nfrom the Atlantic side of the closed channel, and so cause a great low\r\nsea-level, sufficient to attract the ocean waters of the tropical high\r\nsea-level abreast Brazil well into the southern seas. Therefore, it is\r\nimportant to trace nature’s slow methods of closing the wide Cape Horn\r\nchannel at the perfection of an ice age.\r\n\r\nIn my previous explanations on the subject I have thought that, should\r\nthe southern seas have remained at or near the same sea-level as now,\r\nthrough an ice period brought about in the manner I have described,\r\nice-sheets would accumulate on the antarctic continent, and also on the\r\nsouthern lands of South America, sufficient to flow out into the sea\r\nand close the Cape Horn channel.\r\n\r\nBut further consideration shows the impossibility of the southern seas\r\nhaving maintained their present sea-level during the growth of frigid\r\nepochs which have left such ample traces of glaciers having extended\r\nwidely over the lands of the high latitudes of both the northern and\r\nsouthern hemispheres. For it appears that the larger areas of land in\r\nthe northern latitudes, embracing wide continents and large islands,\r\nmust, during the growth of a frigid age, have increased the spread of\r\nglaciers many times greater in extent than could be obtained on the\r\nsmaller lands of the high latitudes of the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nFor it is evident that the water evaporated from the sea and deposited\r\nin snow on the large continents and islands of the high northern\r\nlatitudes during the growth of an ice period would, while thus\r\ndiminishing the ocean waters, greatly increase the weight of northern\r\nlands. Therefore, the waters of the diminishing seas of the southern\r\nlatitudes would be attracted into the northern oceans in opposition to\r\nthe prevailing winds.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the Cape Horn channel would be too much reduced at\r\nthe perfection of an ice age to afford an independent circulation for\r\nthe southern ocean, even without being filled by glaciers to the extent\r\nI have pointed out in previous essays. Still, to whatever dimensions\r\nthe Cape Horn channel might be reduced at the perfection of a frigid\r\nperiod, the enlarged shores bordering its diminished waters would be\r\ncovered by heavy glaciers that would flow into the shrunken strait, and\r\nso close it effectually. Thus the reduction of the Cape Horn channel\r\nduring the advance of an ice age seems, on close consideration, to be a\r\nsimple operation of nature, which in the normal course of events must\r\nhave taken place.\r\n\r\nAs the closing of the Cape Horn channel has been considered by\r\nreviewers the weak and questionable point in preventing my views from\r\ngaining acceptance, it becomes necessary to be explicit concerning the\r\nmanner in which the Cape Horn channel has in past ages been obstructed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the charts prepared by John James Wild, the middle portion\r\nof the strait is represented as being over a thousand fathoms in depth;\r\nbut, as far as I know, its true soundings have never been determined.\r\nThe deep portion of the mid-channel is described as being narrow\r\nwhen compared with its whole breadth from Cape Horn to the antarctic\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nAnd, when it is considered, with the growth of an ice age, how much of\r\nthe ocean waters would be stored in the vast ice-sheets of the northern\r\nhemisphere, and consequently because of their weight a large portion of\r\nthe diminished southern oceans would be attracted into the northern\r\nseas, it seems that the bottom of the shoaler waters of the Cape Horn\r\nchannel, which now comprise so large a portion of its breadth, would be\r\nraised above the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe one-hundred-fathom depth south of Cape Horn, now supposed to extend\r\nfrom longitude 70° west to 55° west, and southward to the latitude of\r\n57°, would be a land supporting heavy glaciers for six hundred miles\r\nalong the north side of the reduced channel during the advanced growth\r\nof a frigid age; and the same conditions would be obtained in the\r\nvicinity of the South Shetland. And when, in addition, we contemplate\r\nthe great snow-fall of that region, and the consequent gathering of\r\nglaciers which would occur on the widened shores of the lessened\r\nchannel, and the certainty of their flowing into the diminished strait,\r\ntogether with the immense icebergs of such an age grounding in the\r\nshoaled waters, it seems that the complete obstruction of the reduced\r\nchannel would be accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhile contemplating the conditions that would obtain while the Cape\r\nHorn channel was being reduced, it will be seen that the independent\r\ncirculation of the icy southern ocean would be carried on to a\r\nconsiderable extent even after the narrowing strait was no longer\r\nable to afford space for wide drift currents, for the reason of the\r\nstrong current that would be caused on account of the high ocean-level\r\nmaintained by the westerly winds on the Pacific side of the diminishing\r\nchannel, and the great low sea-level that would take place on its\r\nAtlantic side.\r\n\r\nStill, as previously shown, it seems that during an advanced stage of\r\nthe frigid epoch, the heavy glaciers from the enlarged northern and\r\nsouthern shores of the shrunken channel, together with the ponderous\r\nicebergs, blocking its waters, the closing process would at last be\r\nspeedy and effective.\r\n\r\nAnd on further consideration it might be said that a channel of much\r\nless width and depth would not have been of sufficient capacity to\r\nhave caused ice periods so wide-spread as those that have left their\r\ntraces on the continents and islands of the globe, for the reason\r\nthat the independent circulation of the southern ocean would not have\r\nbeen sufficiently complete and long continued to have brought such\r\nworld-wide cold periods to perfection.\r\n\r\nWith the Cape Horn channel closed, as above explained, there would be,\r\nas I have asserted, a great change wrought in the circulation of the\r\nsouthern ocean; for instead of the westerly winds blowing its surface\r\nwaters constantly around the globe, and so turning away and preventing\r\nthe entrance of tropical currents into the higher latitudes, the strong\r\nprevailing westerly winds would blow the surface waters of the sea from\r\nthe Atlantic side of the closed Cape Horn channel, and so cause a great\r\nlow sea-level, sufficient to attract the ocean waters of the tropical\r\nhigh sea-level abreast Brazil well into the southern seas.\r\n\r\nThe winds of the southern westerly wind-belt being stronger in that\r\nregion than on any other portion of the globe, consequently they are\r\nable to do nearly as much work while drifting surface water as the belt\r\nof westerly wind of greater width on other parts of the southern seas.\r\nThus a person who has had a long experience with the forcible westerly\r\nwinds of the southern ocean can well understand their ability for\r\ndisturbing the ocean waters in the latitudes of the Cape Horn channel.\r\n\r\nThe drift currents of this region are moved by the winds and waves\r\nfrom one to four miles an hour. Therefore, with the Cape Horn channel\r\nclosed, there is nothing more certain than that the westerly winds\r\nwould be able to cause a vast low sea-level on the Atlantic side of\r\nthe closed Cape Horn strait, and that the waters of the high tropical\r\nsea-level abreast Brazil would be attracted to its wide depression, as\r\nshown on map No. 1.\r\n\r\nThe tropical waters thus attracted far southward would be cooler\r\nthan the tropical waters of to-day, owing to the great amount of\r\ncold imparted to the ocean by the numerous icebergs of a frigid age.\r\nStill, they would begin the slow process of raising the temperature\r\nof the southern ocean, and would in time carry sufficient heat into\r\nthe southern regions to melt the ice from all southern lands; for, in\r\naddition to the Brazil currents, the waters of the high sea-level of\r\nthe tropical Indian Ocean which pass southward down the Mozambique\r\nchannel would reach a much higher latitude than during periods when the\r\nCape Horn channel was open.\r\n\r\nThe ice periods of the northern and southern hemispheres being\r\nconcurrent, a condition which I shall explain in another chapter, makes\r\nit obvious that during the melting of the glaciers from the antarctic\r\ncontinent and other southern lands the depleted Cape Horn channel\r\ncould not gain sufficient capacity to give an independent circulation\r\nto the southern ocean during the melting of the southern ice-sheets,\r\non account of the diminishing heaviness of the antarctic ice and the\r\ngreater weight of the extensive glaciers and augmented seas of the\r\nnorthern latitudes. Consequently, it seems that the southern seas would\r\ncontinue in a lessened state while the glaciers were being melted from\r\nthe northern hemisphere, as was the case during the melting of the ice\r\nfrom the southern hemisphere; and, furthermore, during such times the\r\nglaciers which overrun all the low lands and shoal waters of the Cape\r\nHorn region would, on account of their position being to the windward\r\nof the tropical currents, be the last great mass of ice to melt from\r\nthe southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it seems that the Cape Horn channel would continue closed\r\nor greatly obstructed while the glaciers were being melted from the\r\nlands of both hemispheres. Thus at length a mild climate would extend\r\nover the globe, and so remain until the prevailing winds slowly forced\r\nthe surface waters of the sea into the southern ocean in the manner\r\nexplained in previous pages, thus filling the Cape Horn channel to its\r\npresent capacity, and again restoring the independent circulation of\r\nthe southern ocean.\r\n\r\nWhile contemplating the conditions that would obtain during the melting\r\nof the ice from the antarctic lands, it will be seen that the tropical\r\nwaters attracted to the great low sea-level to the leeward of the\r\nclosed Cape Horn channel would eventually enter the great bight of\r\nthe antarctic continent to the eastward of Graham Land, where Captain\r\nWeddell sailed to the latitude of 74° south. This deep gulf, owing to\r\nits situation, would receive the full impact of the southern movement\r\nof the tropical currents; and, as the warm waters spread over the\r\nwide sea-level, the westerly winds would convert them into a drift\r\ncurrent, and under such conditions would be driven along the shores\r\nof the antarctic continent, past the South Indian and Pacific Oceans,\r\nand eventually, after undergoing a cooling process from the long icy\r\npassage, be forced against the Pacific side of the closed Cape Horn\r\nchannel and the western Patagonian coast.\r\n\r\nWhile regarding the circulation of the sea during an ice age, it may\r\nbe said that the ocean’s being composed of brine was the cause of its\r\nwaters being able to circulate in frigid latitudes where fresh water\r\nwould congeal. Consequently, this is one of the reasons why successive\r\nperiods of frigidity and mildness have been brought about; for with an\r\nocean of fresh water, repeated epochs of cold and warmth could not have\r\noccurred, because a sea composed of fresh water would have congealed\r\nwhile circulating in the high latitudes during a frigid age. Therefore,\r\nit required a sea of brine to maintain a liquid state during the low\r\ntemperature of an ice period.\r\n\r\nFor, while the cold of a glacial age increased, the saltness of the sea\r\nincreased also, because of the great amount of fresh water evaporated\r\nfrom the ocean, and stored in ice-sheets on the great continents and\r\nislands of the globe. Thus the briny sea was maintained in a liquid\r\nstate, while washing vast ice-fields and glaciated shores and floating\r\nthe numerous icebergs of a freezing age. The cold which radiated\r\nfrom such ice-bound seas must have been severe; but meanwhile the\r\nevaporation from the ocean was much reduced, while the saltness and\r\ncoldness of the sea increased, and so prevented the ice of a glacial\r\nperiod from gaining invincible proportions before the independent\r\ncirculation of the southern ocean was arrested. Therefore, the\r\nremaining warmth of the tropical waters after gaining free access to\r\nthe antarctic latitudes was able to overcome the accumulated cold of\r\nthat frigid region.\r\n\r\nAt this date the observant navigators who have visited the antarctic\r\nseas report that the surface currents above the latitude of Cape Horn,\r\nwhile being drifted eastward by the prevailing westerly winds, also set\r\ntoward the antarctic ice cliffs, as shown on map No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this southerly set of the surface currents becomes\r\nnoticeable above the latitude of 55° south is because the tropical\r\ncurrents which set southward from the torrid latitudes on the western\r\nsides of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, although largely\r\nturned away from the high latitudes by the westerly winds and drift\r\ncurrents, are also able to send sufficient water into the great\r\nbelt of westerly winds to furnish water for the deep under-currents\r\nsetting northward from the antarctic shores. Thus the surface waters\r\nmoving from the north in order to gain the higher latitudes, after\r\nentering the westerly wind-belt, are moved in drift currents by the\r\nimpelling winds easterly over many degrees of longitude, and also at\r\nthe same time slowly southward among the cooling icebergs, because of\r\nthe attraction caused by the difference of temperature and density\r\nbetween the northern drift waters and the icy seas of the antarctic ice\r\nbarrier. Consequently, the gradual movement of the surface waters of\r\nthe westerly wind-belt southward before entering the higher latitudes\r\nis not generally apparent; for it is after they enter latitudes where\r\nthe globe becomes much reduced in circumference that their southern\r\nmovement in the contracted seas becomes more noticeable. The impact of\r\nthis southerly current, which finds its outlet in deep under-currents,\r\nand retards somewhat the increase of ice on the southern continent at\r\nthis date, also largely prevents the small icebergs and field-ice from\r\nfloating northward, away from the antarctic ice barrier; for it is such\r\nlarge icebergs as penetrate the deep under-currents that are the best\r\nable to move into the more temperate latitudes.\r\n\r\nFrom the above explanations it will be seen that the impact of surface\r\nwater against the antarctic ice barrier when the Cape Horn channel\r\nwas closed would greatly assist the tropical waters attracted to the\r\ngreat low sea-level to the leeward of the obstructed strait to wash the\r\nantarctic shores while being drifted eastward by the westerly winds\r\nover the southern ocean against the Patagonian coast and the Pacific\r\nside of the closed channel, and there causing a high sea-level. This\r\nmovement of the winds and currents encircling the antarctic continent\r\nis shown on map No. 1.\r\n\r\nThe vast, high sea-level caused by the westerly winds drifting the\r\nsurface waters against the Patagonian coast would obtain a much higher\r\nplain, were it not that so much of the water of the great drift current\r\nwas required to feed the antarctic under-current which constantly sets\r\nnorthward from the antarctic shores; yet it would be sufficient to\r\ngreatly increase the volume of the Humboldt current, which would flow\r\nin the same direction it now flows, down the South American coast to\r\nthe equatorial latitudes, where it would become the main source of the\r\ngreat equatorial stream, and thus offset the increased southward flow\r\nof the equatorial waters through the Brazil and Mozambique streams.\r\n\r\nThe equatorial stream, with its increased volume, would also move, as\r\nit moves to-day, across the Pacific; and, on gaining the western side,\r\nafter sending off large streams to the northern and southern latitudes,\r\nit would pass through the East India passages into the Indian Ocean,\r\nwhere it would be drifted westward by the trade winds and cause a high\r\nsea-level abreast the east coast of Africa, and so become the source\r\nof the great Mozambique current, which would flow southward along the\r\neast coast of Africa, and, with the Cape Horn channel closed, would\r\ngain a much higher latitude than it would with the channel open. At\r\nthis age, when the continuation of this great equatorial stream gains\r\nthe latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, its waters are largely turned\r\neastward by the great drift current of the southern ocean.\r\n\r\nStill, a considerable portion of its waters turns toward the west,\r\nforming the Agulhas current, which flows around the Cape of Good Hope\r\ninto the Atlantic, where it mingles with the cooler currents which\r\nbranch off from the great southern drift current; and so, in connection\r\nwith the latter, it is attracted to the low sea-level caused by the\r\nsouth-east trade winds abreast the south-western coast of Africa,\r\nand from thence moved as a drift current by the trade winds to the\r\nequatorial Atlantic and coast of Brazil. Thus it will be seen that the\r\nAgulhas current, even with the Cape Horn channel in possession of its\r\npresent wide capacity, serves to retard somewhat the advance of a cold\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Agulhas current at this date also partly serves to replenish the\r\nwater which is forced from the South Atlantic by strong westerly winds\r\ninto the Southern Indian and Southern Pacific Oceans. For it appears\r\nthat more water is now removed by such winds from the South Atlantic\r\nthan enters it from the South Pacific, even through the enlarged Cape\r\nHorn channel of this date; and this fact seems to favor an impression\r\nthat a portion of this enlarged channel existed prior to the glacial\r\nperiods, but with its waters so much reduced as to be unable to give\r\nthe southern ocean an independent circulation sufficient to exclude the\r\ntropical currents from reaching the high southern latitudes in adequate\r\nvolume to maintain a mild climate in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nFor previous to the glacial age, with little or no ice gathered on\r\nthe antarctic lands, it seems that a strait possessing one-half the\r\ncapacity of the Cape Horn channel of the present age could not prevent\r\nthe Brazil current and the Agulhas stream from flowing into the\r\nsouthern ocean in quantities sufficient to make it impossible for\r\nglaciers to form on southern lands.\r\n\r\nThus it is probable that a reduced channel separated the western\r\ncontinent from the antarctic lands even in the mild eras previous to\r\nthe glacial epochs.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Horn channel, at the present age, with a capacity sufficient\r\nto largely maintain an independent circulation for the southern ocean,\r\nis still only one-third of the breadth of the westerly wind-belt of the\r\nsouthern seas. Therefore, the drift currents do not all pass through\r\nit from the Pacific into the Atlantic. Consequently, a considerable\r\nportion of the drifted water turns northward west of Cape Horn, and so\r\nforms the Humboldt current.\r\n\r\nThe Agulhas stream, which even now assists in replenishing the South\r\nAtlantic with tropical water, would, during the perfection of a glacial\r\nperiod, with the Cape channel closed, be a much stronger stream than\r\nit now obtains with the Cape channel possessing its present enlarged\r\ncapacity, for the reason that the South Atlantic waters would continue\r\nas now to be forced eastward by the westerly winds, while they could\r\nnot be replenished, as they are to-day, directly from the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the waters of the South Atlantic Ocean would be\r\ncorrespondingly reduced.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions alone would greatly increase the volume of the Agulhas\r\nstream at the culmination of a frigid age. Therefore, the work of\r\nsubduing a frigid period in the southern hemisphere after the Cape Horn\r\nchannel was closed would not rest on the Brazil current alone, but also\r\non the great equatorial stream of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\r\n\r\nYet during such frigid times the sources of the equatorial stream would\r\nbe greatly chilled by its two great feeders, the Humboldt current and\r\nthe returning Japanese current, both of which flow down from the high\r\nlatitudes and meet in the equatorial latitudes on the eastern side of\r\nthe Pacific, thus cooling the source of the great equatorial current.\r\n\r\nBut this latter stream, while on its long western passage across\r\nthe Pacific and Indian Oceans, beneath a torrid sun, with only\r\none cold feeder from the south which approaches it along the west\r\nside of Australia, would, on its long tropical journey, be able to\r\nobtain considerable warmth, even during an ice period, to supply the\r\nMozambique and Agulhas streams, and so greatly assist the Atlantic\r\nwaters in bringing about a mild period. Still, the process of subduing\r\nthe cold of the southern latitudes would be slow, even with the Cape\r\nHorn channel closed, because of the vast collection of ice burdening\r\nthe sea and land.\r\n\r\nYet there were conditions that were naturally brought about to favor\r\nthe process of returning warmth; for it appears that, when the southern\r\nocean was made shallow because of a considerable portion of its waters\r\nhaving been moved into the northern hemisphere, it will be seen that\r\nthe conditions were more favorable for the westerly winds to create\r\ndrift currents than would be the case on deeper seas. Therefore,\r\nthe high and low sea-levels caused by such winds would be greater\r\non a shallow ocean than would occur on deeper waters. Thus the low\r\nsea-levels of the shallow southern sea would have strong attraction\r\nfor tropical surface waters, and so increase the thickness of its warm\r\ndrift currents, and at the same time its lessened depths would have\r\nless capacity for the storage of cold water to reduce the temperature\r\nof the under-waters of the tropical zone.\r\n\r\nAnd, furthermore, when the southern ocean was shallow, New Zealand\r\nacquired a longer extension of land to the north and south.\r\nConsequently, the enlarged low sea-level on its eastern side attracted\r\nmore tropical water into the southern latitudes than now.\r\n\r\nSo, according to the conditions I have pointed out, the ice-sheets\r\nwould at length melt away, and a long period of mildness would succeed\r\non account of the length of time it would require after the ice\r\ndisappeared from the earth for the prevailing winds to move the surface\r\nwaters of the augmented northern seas into the southern ocean, and\r\nagain restore its independent circulation, and so, after a considerable\r\nlapse of time, bring about the geographical and climatic conditions\r\nexisting at the present date, which can be seen on map No. 2, which\r\nshows that a cold period has already made considerable advance in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, the southern continent and islands being covered\r\nwith glaciers, and the prevalence of icebergs as far north as the\r\nlatitude of 35° south.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when we consider that the independent circulation of the\r\nsouthern ocean is caused by the westerly winds blowing its surface\r\nwaters constantly around the globe through the open Cape Horn channel,\r\nand so largely preventing the tropical currents from entering the\r\nhigh southern latitudes, and how, in consequence, the cold is slowly\r\non the increase through the constant accumulation of ice on the lands\r\nand in seas of the southern latitudes, it appears that a frigid age\r\nis slowly progressing in the southern hemisphere. For it seems that\r\ncontinental ice-sheets should not only be able to retain their freezing\r\ntemperature, but also the mean of the low temperature in which they\r\nwere formed, for a considerable length of time, and so impart their\r\nextreme coldness in the shape of icebergs into such seas as border on\r\nthe glaciated lands.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved at Point Barrow that strata of ice and gravel can\r\nmaintain a wintry temperature through the summer months. Captain\r\nG. B. Borden, keeper of the refuge station in that region, states\r\nthat Lieutenant Ray, of the Signal Service, excavated through ice and\r\ngravel to a depth of forty-one feet, and that the lower portion of the\r\nexcavation maintains a temperature 15° Fahrenheit above zero the year\r\naround. Therefore, with the probability of southern glaciers obtaining\r\na temperature of over 15° Fahrenheit below the freezing point, we\r\ncan well realize the frigidity imparted to the southern oceans while\r\nmelting numerous immense icebergs, and consequently will conclude that\r\nthe temperature of the southern latitudes is gradually lowering.\r\n\r\nThe icebergs of the antarctic seas would not move northward into the\r\ntemperature latitudes so readily as they now do, were it not that the\r\ngeneral southward set of the southern ocean currents were interrupted\r\nby the movement of northerly surface currents in the longitudes of\r\nthe low sea-levels, caused by the westerly winds drifting the surface\r\nwaters of the sea from the eastern coasts of Southern South America and\r\nNew Zealand. For it is owing to the low sea-levels thus created, in\r\nconnection with the deep under-currents which set northward from the\r\nice cliffs of the antarctic lands, that many icebergs are enabled to\r\nmove into the temperate latitudes, especially to seas north-east of the\r\nFalkland Islands.\r\n\r\nOn other portions of the southern ocean above the latitude of 55° south\r\nthe surface waters, while being drifted eastward by the strong westerly\r\nwinds, also set toward the antarctic shores, and so furnish water for\r\nthe cold under-currents which set northward from that frigid region.\r\nThus from such parts of the coast only the largest bergs, which require\r\na deep sea to float them, are moved by the under-currents into the\r\ntemperate latitudes. Therefore, it happens that, while an ice period\r\nprogresses, and the antarctic icebergs increase in size, the more\r\nreadily the cold, deep under-currents force them into the temperate\r\nzone, in opposition to the winds and surface currents.\r\n\r\nThe icebergs, after gaining the temperate latitudes, are moved more\r\nor less eastward by the westerly winds and drift currents, and so are\r\nscattered over the southern temperate oceans, where the melting bergs\r\nimpart whatever coldness they were able to store up while forming in\r\nthe antarctic regions.\r\n\r\nThe low sea-levels caused by the westerly winds to the leeward of New\r\nZealand and to the leeward of Argentine, not only cause the ice-bearing\r\ncurrents to set northward, but they also cause the tropical currents to\r\nmake considerable inroads into the high southern latitudes. This is the\r\nreason why the lands are less burdened with ice on the antarctic shores\r\nopposite Cape Horn than on other parts of that glaciated continent.\r\n\r\nThe tropical currents which turn southward east of New Zealand largely\r\nmingle their waters with the great southern drift current, and so\r\nare carried through the Cape Horn channel. Owing to this cause, the\r\nantarctic lands abreast Cape Horn are less burdened with ice than other\r\nportions of the antarctic shores.\r\n\r\nThus, were it not for this penetration of warm waters southward, the\r\nantarctic coasts south of Cape Horn, because of the great snow-fall of\r\nthat region, would obtain heavier glaciers than other portions of the\r\nsouthern continent. But the time is slowly coming when, with a lower\r\ntemperature, the ice-sheets on the lands in the vicinity of the South\r\nShetlands will attain greater thickness than the glaciers on other\r\nshores of the antarctic continent.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that, when the several agents for producing\r\nand distributing cold in the southern latitudes are taken into\r\nconsideration, the immense and continuous storage of ice on the\r\nsouthern lands, which adds to the wide-spread fleet of icebergs that\r\nfloat the southern temperate seas, and also the vast movement of\r\ncold antarctic water into the temperate and tropical oceans in deep\r\nunder-currents, combined with the increasing coldness of the westerly\r\nwinds, are now slowly bringing about in the southern hemisphere a\r\nperiod of frigidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHOW ICE PERIODS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ARE BROUGHT ABOUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA large number of geologists are of the opinion that during the whole\r\nof the Tertiary period the climate of the northern temperate and arctic\r\nlatitudes was uniformly warm, without a trace of intervening frigid\r\nperiods. I have before explained why the climate was made warm in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere during the Tertiary epoch, and how on the closing\r\nof that age, and subsequently, a considerable portion of the ocean\r\nwaters had moved from the northern hemisphere into the southern.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the northern seas during Tertiary times covered a much\r\nlarger area than have obtained during periods following that mild\r\nepoch. So, when the low lands of Europe were submerged, the Baltic,\r\nCaspian, and other neighboring seas, now land-locked, were a portion of\r\nan enlarged Atlantic. Consequently, the westerly winds blew over a much\r\nwider North Atlantic than during the later periods.\r\n\r\nThus the high sea-level caused by such winds on its European side was\r\ngreater than has since been obtained with the Atlantic of less breadth.\r\nThis high sea-level, composed largely of drift water from the ancient\r\nGulf Stream, had convenient access to the enlarged Arctic Ocean, which\r\nthen covered the low plains of Northern Europe and Siberia. And owing\r\nto the trend of elevated lands north-eastward, which then formed the\r\nsouthern shores of the Arctic Ocean in those regions, the warm waters\r\nof the high sea-level of the Eastern North Atlantic found an easy\r\npassage into the arctic seas; for, while they moved over the European\r\nand Siberian seas to the north-east, they had the assistance of the\r\nwesterly winds well into the arctic seas, from which position they\r\nwere attracted across the Arctic Ocean to the low sea-level abreast\r\nLabrador and Davis Strait.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream of Tertiary times comprised a much larger area than it\r\nnow obtains; for with Florida and a large portion of the Gulf States\r\nsubmerged, and a wide, shallow sea covering the Mississippi valley\r\nand the Great Lake region, the tropical waters of the enlarged Gulf\r\nof Mexico moved from their vast high sea-level to the low sea-level\r\nabreast British America and Labrador, without being confined to the\r\nnarrow Florida channel. Thus with an enlarged Gulf Stream in possession\r\nof a wide and clear passage leading northward, in connection with a\r\nmild period in the southern hemisphere, giving warmth to the southern\r\noceans, the resources of the ancient Gulf currents for warming the\r\nnorthern regions were so ample and inexhaustive they were fully able to\r\nmaintain a mild climate on the shores of the European seas, and also on\r\nthe shores bordering the Arctic Ocean, during the Tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Humboldt current, which had its rise in the mild\r\nsouthern seas of that age, mingled its warmth with the equatorial\r\ncurrent of the Pacific, which in turn gave its warmth to the Japanese\r\ncurrent. Therefore, the latter stream under such conditions was\r\ncompetent to maintain a mild climate on the North Pacific coasts.\r\n\r\nThe origin of a cold period in the northern hemisphere was largely\r\nowing to the changed condition of the northern oceans following the\r\nclose of the Tertiary epoch. The movement of the ocean waters into the\r\nsouthern hemisphere lessened the area of the Arctic and North Atlantic\r\nOceans, and brought them to their present reduced limits, and also\r\ndiminished the volume of the Gulf currents.\r\n\r\nThis great geographical change, in connection with a cold period\r\nprogressing in the southern hemisphere, and so increasing the coldness\r\nof the Japanese current, and the cold antarctic currents, previously\r\nexplained, which set northward on the bottom of the sea through the\r\ntorrid latitudes even into the North Pacific and North Atlantic\r\nOceans, were altogether sufficient to cause conditions favorable for\r\nthe advancement of a cold period in northern latitudes. Besides, with\r\nreduced northern oceans and a diminished Gulf current, conditions were\r\nfavorable for an independent circulation of the arctic waters, such as\r\nis being carried out at the present time. Hence an explanation of the\r\nmovements of the ocean waters of to-day will explain the conditions\r\nwhich caused the northern ice periods in times past, as well as\r\nthose to come in a future age. Although the conditions are such that\r\nthe independent circulation of the arctic waters cannot be so well\r\nperformed as the independent circulation of the southern ocean, still\r\nthe open arctic channels are able to prevent the tropical Gulf Stream\r\nwater from largely entering the higher northern latitudes. For it is\r\ncertain that the prevailing westerly winds blow the surface waters of\r\nthe North Atlantic away from the eastern shores of North America from\r\nGeorgia to Labrador.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the low sea-level thus caused attracts the waters of\r\nthe Arctic Ocean southward through Baffin’s Bay and Davis Strait, and\r\nlikewise down the east coast of Greenland, thus surrounding that large\r\nisland with an arctic temperature, and so causing it to become a land\r\nof glaciers, which are constantly launching icebergs into the sea to\r\ncool the waters of the northern oceans. The tropical waters of the high\r\nsea-level of the Gulf of Mexico also seek the low sea-level abreast the\r\nAmerican coast, thus causing the Gulf Stream. This great ocean current,\r\nbeing the main conveyer of tropical heat into the high latitudes of\r\nthe North Atlantic, calls for particular notice. The great gravity\r\ncurrents, of which the Gulf Stream is one of the most conspicuous, are\r\nmoved by small gradients.\r\n\r\nHence the gradient which causes the Gulf Stream waters to move out\r\nof the Florida passage is small. The levellings which have been made\r\nplace the surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico as being about one\r\nmetre higher than the Atlantic abreast New York, the pressure of the\r\nhigher Gulf waters toward the low level of the Atlantic being nearly\r\nequal in the narrow Florida channel from the surface to the bottom of\r\nthe stream. Therefore, according to descriptions given by Commander\r\nBartlett, the warm stream moves like a river over the hard level floor\r\nof the channel; but to the northward of the Bahamas, abreast Cape\r\nHatteras, the stream spreads out in fanlike form, and flows over a bed\r\nof cold water of great depth.\r\n\r\nA bed of cold water is found to cover the bottom of all the deep oceans\r\nthat are accessible to the antarctic seas, through which the cold water\r\nis mostly supplied, as I have before pointed out.\r\n\r\nBut the cold water which underruns the Gulf Stream is probably\r\nfurnished by the arctic waters which move down Davis Strait and the\r\neast coast of Greenland. The Gulf Stream, as it widens and becomes more\r\nshallow, is, through its exposure to the westerly winds, gradually\r\nconverted into a drift current; and in this way its surface waters are\r\nforced over abreast the shores of Western Europe, where it imparts its\r\nwarmth to a wide region, and also causes a high sea-level. A portion\r\nof the waters of this high sea-level turn southward to replenish the\r\nwaters which have been moved by the trade winds from the eastern\r\ntropical North Atlantic over into the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico,\r\nwhile its northern and smaller portion mingles with the Arctic Ocean\r\nwaters north of Europe. These latter waters, having escaped from the\r\nwesterly wind-belt, and acquired a high sea-level, and also made cool\r\non mingling with the icy arctic seas, lose a part of their bulk on\r\nbecoming chilled by sinking and returning in under-currents to the seas\r\nfrom which they were forced by the south-westerly winds; while the\r\nlarger remaining surface waters set across the Arctic Ocean over to\r\nthe northern coast of Greenland, and so down the east and west coasts\r\nof that large island to the low sea-level abreast the American coast,\r\nwhere the cold waters not only crowd the Gulf Stream from the shore,\r\nbut they also sink under it, and form the vast bed of cold water over\r\nwhich the Gulf currents flow. This cold underflow of water southward\r\nprobably joins the deep antarctic currents south and south-east of the\r\nBermuda Islands, and returns to the tropical latitudes a portion of the\r\nwater that is carried into the Arctic Ocean by the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nThere are times during the late summer and early fall months when the\r\narctic channels are considerably obstructed by icebergs, and the low\r\nsea-level of Davis Strait and Baffin’s Bay, with the assistance of\r\noccasional south-east winds, is able to attract the temperate waters\r\nof the Atlantic as far north as the Arctic Circle. Also from the same\r\ncause the icy waters which flow down the east coast of Greenland are\r\nattracted along its southern and south-western shores into Davis Strait.\r\n\r\nYet at the same time the icy waters which flow from Smith’s Sound and\r\nother arctic channels move in a counter-current down the westerly\r\nside of Baffin’s Bay and Davis Strait, and so carry the icebergs and\r\nfield-ice past Labrador and Newfoundland well on to the borders of the\r\nGulf Stream. And, according to Lieutenant Maury, the westerly gales of\r\nthe winter months force the temperate waters of the Atlantic, which\r\npertain to the Gulf Stream, several degrees away from the south-east\r\ncoast of Greenland. Therefore, during such seasons the surface waters\r\nof the returned arctic currents, which flow down the east coast of\r\nGreenland and Davis Strait, are drifted past Southern Greenland and\r\nIceland, and so onward into the arctic seas, north of Europe. Thus the\r\narctic waters maintain an independent circulation sufficient to largely\r\nexclude the Gulf Stream from the arctic seas, and surround Greenland\r\nwith an arctic temperature; and it is on this account glaciers have\r\nformed on Greenland and other arctic shores, and such glaciers are\r\nprobably increasing, as every iceberg launched from the frigid lands\r\nand floated to the lower latitudes lowers somewhat the temperature\r\nof the North Atlantic, and so causes conditions favorable for larger\r\naccumulations of ice on the arctic shores.\r\n\r\nYet it is probable that an ice period extending over the northern\r\ntemperate zone could not be perfected by this process alone, should the\r\ntropical and southern oceans maintain their present temperature. But,\r\nwith the assistance of a frigid period in the southern hemisphere to\r\ncool the ocean waters, and thus lower the temperature of all tropical\r\ncurrents, including the Gulf Stream and Japan currents, an ice age\r\ncould be brought about in the northern hemisphere equal in intensity to\r\nthe glacial periods of the past.\r\n\r\nAnd, when we know that a considerable portion of the heat carried into\r\nthe northern latitudes by tropical streams is largely derived through\r\nthe mingling of the waters of such currents with the warm waters of\r\nthe southern tropical oceans, it is evident that the ice periods of\r\nthe northern and southern hemispheres were concurrent; although the\r\nculmination of the northern frigid period would be somewhat later\r\nthan the perfected southern ice age, on account of the northern seas\r\nrequiring the assistance of the cold oceans of the southern hemisphere\r\nto perfect a northern ice age.\r\n\r\nThe small area of the northern seas, compared with the southern oceans,\r\nand the wide mingling of the ocean waters of the hemispheres, make it\r\nevident that the comparatively scanty northern seas could not bring\r\nabout or maintain either a frigid or mild period in opposition to the\r\nsuperior oceans of the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nOn the consummation of an ice period in the northern hemisphere heavy\r\nglaciers covered the larger portion of its continents and islands,\r\nwhich added so much weight to the northern lands as to attract the\r\nwaters of the southern oceans into the northern latitudes, as I have\r\nbefore explained.\r\n\r\nThus, when the ice was mostly melted from the lands of the southern\r\nhemisphere, the heavy ice-sheets that remained on the extensive\r\nnorthern lands would still continue to attract the warm waters of the\r\nsouthern seas into the northern oceans; and in this way the Japanese\r\nand Gulf currents would gain a higher temperature and greater volume,\r\nand thus add to their ability for melting the northern glaciers\r\nwherever they were able to flow, and so hasten the growth of a mild era\r\nin the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nAnd it seems reasonable to suppose that there was more water in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere on the ending of its ice period than at this age;\r\nyet it appears that it was returned to the southern hemisphere during\r\na short period by the prevailing winds in the manner which I have\r\npreviously explained.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there are but few traces of such flowage to be found in the\r\nglacial drift, especially with the scarcity of marine life after the\r\nrigor of a frigid age.\r\n\r\nAn article in _Science_, July 5, 1895, written by Agnes Crane, states\r\nthat Professor Joseph Prestwich has recently contributed a suggestive\r\nmemoir on this subject to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety. It treats of the evidence of a submergence of Western Europe\r\nand the Mediterranean coasts at the close of the glacial period; and in\r\na previous paper communicated to the Geological Society of London, in\r\n1892, the author gave evidence, deduced from personal observation, of\r\nthe submergence of the south of England not less than a thousand feet,\r\nat the close of the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nSince that time the flood of water which flowed all of the low lands\r\nof the high northern latitudes has been returned to the southern seas,\r\nbecause of the force of the prevailing winds in connection with the\r\ngreat oceans which open so widely toward the south, the force of the\r\nwinds being assisted through the attraction caused by the difference\r\nof temperature in the surface waters of the vast southern temperate\r\noceans and the antarctic seas, and in this manner bringing about the\r\ngeographical conditions of to-day which favor the return of another ice\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIt is said by those who attribute the great currents of the ocean to\r\nthe rotation of the earth that the winds have little to do in causing\r\nsuch currents as the Gulf Stream. But my impression is that the\r\nsouthern portion of the Gulf Stream waters, after being drifted by\r\nwesterly winds over abreast Europe, are attracted to the low sea-level\r\nin the vicinity of the Canary Islands, to be moved by the trade winds\r\ntoward the equatorial calm belt and the West India Islands. And during\r\nmy many months’ cruising over these seas I have had my attention\r\ndirected to the singular action of the surface waters, while being\r\nimpelled by the trade winds toward the West India sea; for during the\r\nfirst fifteen hundred miles of their passage they are moved by the\r\nprevailing easterly winds without much apparent resistance or unusual\r\ndisturbance. But on nearing the longitude of Cape St. Roque, and\r\nhaving acquired a high sea-level from which there is no easy or wide\r\noutlet, the impelled surface waters begin to rebel against the forceful\r\nwinds, and cause a remarkable commotion in the shape of tide-rips and\r\nwhite-capped ripples, which extend from the equator in a northerly\r\ndirection to the latitude of about 19° north, thus crossing the central\r\nportion of the north-east trade-wind belt, with a breadth of over three\r\nhundred miles, as shown on map No. 2.\r\n\r\nThis disturbed region where the winds and waters conflict is the\r\nprobable fountain-head of the Gulf Stream. The reason why the surface\r\nwaters of this disturbed portion of the Atlantic do not flow peacefully\r\nalong through the West India passages into the Caribbean Sea and Gulf\r\nof Mexico is because of their narrow outlet at the Florida channel. For\r\nit is mainly through this narrow channel that the vast waters of the\r\ntropical high sea-level are attracted to the low ocean-level of the\r\nWestern North Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThus it seems that the great fountain-head of the Gulf Stream is\r\nsituated between the wide tide-rips and the Caribbean Islands. The\r\nwaters from this high ocean-level enter the Caribbean Sea mainly\r\nthrough the several passages south of Guadeloupe; while the northern\r\nportion of the raised waters set mostly toward the north-west, and so\r\nunite with the eastern portion of the Gulf currents after they enter\r\nthe Atlantic. Still, the great high sea-level which presses against\r\nthe Windward Islands, being somewhat higher than the Caribbean Sea,\r\nforces its waters through the island passages in quantities sufficient\r\nto supply the Gulf Stream; and there are times when the winds are so\r\nstrong and favorable that all of the passages east of Cuba conduct\r\nwater into the Caribbean Sea, the cold under-waters entering the deeper\r\nchannels as well as the warm surface waters. Yet the currents setting\r\nthrough these numerous channels are subject to fluctuations, and so\r\nalso is the Gulf Stream which they supply.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the high sea-level south of Guadeloupe receives\r\nconsiderable assistance as a feeder for the Gulf Stream through being\r\nconnected on the south by the great high sea-level abreast Brazil and\r\nthe great high sea-level of the equatorial calm belt. The latter high\r\nlevel is caused by the trade winds, which generally blow briskly down\r\nthe coast of Sahara, and also further off shore, and ending south of\r\nthe Cape Verde Islands somewhat abruptly in the equatorial calm belt.\r\n\r\nThe south-east trades which blow over the Eastern and Middle South\r\nAtlantic terminate on the southern side of the calm region. Therefore,\r\nthe two trade winds impel the surface waters of the tropical Atlantic\r\nfrom opposite directions directly toward the calm belt, and so raise\r\nits waters above the common level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThis is the opinion of the writers of the South Atlantic Directory.\r\nStill, it is probable that the high ocean-level of the calm belt is\r\nbut slightly raised above the common level of the sea, on account of\r\nthe trade winds having to contend against the tendency of the warm\r\ntropical surface waters to move toward the polar latitudes. The calm\r\nbelt expanse which extends from Africa, where it attains its greatest\r\nwidth, gradually narrows as it extends westward to the longitude of\r\nCape St. Roque, where it attains its highest sea-level, on account of\r\nthe borders of its narrowing space being impelled westward by the trade\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the waters of this high ocean-level is mostly toward\r\nthe west, forming a portion of the equatorial current of the Atlantic.\r\nThe reason of its western movement is on account of its raised waters\r\nbeing able to supply a portion of the Gulf Stream with water which is\r\nsent off in a westerly current along the South American coast, west of\r\nCape St. Roque into the Caribbean Sea; while, on the other hand, it\r\njoins with the great high sea-level abreast Brazil, and so unites with\r\nits great southern current. The gradient of the high sea-level of the\r\ncalm belt on its southern side probably extends south of the equator,\r\non account of the south-east trades being weak in latitudes near the\r\nequator; while on the north side the north-east trades generally blow\r\nbrisk and end more abruptly, so producing a gradient of less width than\r\nthat of the South Atlantic side.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the seas of the high northern latitudes gain\r\nan undue proportion of the tropical Atlantic waters, because of the\r\nsouth-east trades extending north of the equator, on account of such\r\nwinds being weak, and the waters of the high sea-level of the Western\r\nNorth Atlantic having narrow and otherwise obstructed passages leading\r\nto its northern seas. Yet the high sea-level of the equatorial calm\r\nbelt is always ready, whenever a favorable grade is formed by a monsoon\r\nor otherwise, to run off its surplus water obtained by winds and rain;\r\nand I have noticed, while cruising in these seas, that it happens at\r\ntimes during the northern winter months when the north-westerly gales\r\ndrive the surface waters of the North-western Atlantic toward the\r\ntropical zone, and at the same time a strong north-east monsoon is\r\nprevailing along the southern coast of Brazil, the westerly currents\r\nsetting past the Amazon River are reversed, and set to the south-east,\r\nwhile such conditions last.\r\n\r\nFor, when the summer solstice is in the south, and the north-east\r\nmonsoon moves southward along the coast of Brazil, much equatorial\r\nwater moves off in that direction; and during the same season the\r\ncooled Sahara has an outward flow of air toward the south, which\r\nmoves more or less water from the coast of Guinea, which is easily\r\naccomplished, because the warm surface waters of that coast are\r\ninclined to join with the south equatorial stream. Consequently, the\r\nwaters move from their high sea-level north of Cape Palmas, and so form\r\nthe Guinea current.\r\n\r\nThe high sea-level of the equatorial calm belt of the Atlantic contains\r\na large portion of the conserved heat of the tropical Atlantic, which\r\nat this age sends off a somewhat limited supply of warm water to\r\nthe Gulf Stream, and also to the Brazil current. But, whenever the\r\nCape Horn channel is closed or much obstructed, so causing a great\r\nlow sea-level in the Southern Atlantic, the tropical waters heaped\r\nagainst Brazil, and the raised waters of the great calm region being\r\none continuous high sea-level, would mostly be attracted to the vast\r\nlow sea-level of the southern ocean. Hence it will be seen how large a\r\nportion of the conserved heat of the tropical Atlantic would be used to\r\nwarm the high southern latitudes during a warm period in the southern\r\nhemisphere, and at the same time the head-waters of the Gulf Stream\r\nwould obtain the same height as now. For we now see much of the force\r\nof the north-east trade winds lost, while maintaining so large a high\r\nsea-level to the windward of the West India Islands, which is probably\r\ncapable of supplying a stream of double the capacity of the gulf\r\ncurrent which passes through the Florida channel.\r\n\r\nAnd it appears, while viewing the vast reservoirs of warm water\r\napparently gathered by trade winds to subdue the cold of the high\r\nlatitudes, that much of the energy of such winds is now lost to the\r\nworld, while maintaining a vast and pent-up high sea-level which has\r\na difficult outlet to the northern seas, and no strongly attractive\r\nlow sea-level to move its waters into the oceans of the high southern\r\nlatitudes. The wide waters which are banked up to the windward of\r\nthe West India Islands, and cause the wide tide-rips, set mostly\r\nto the westward into the Caribbean Sea through the passages south\r\nof Guadeloupe, while the northern portion of the raised waters set\r\nmostly toward the north, and thus form the eastern boundary of the\r\nGulf Stream, and comprise the inner circle of the great current that\r\nencircles the Sargasso Sea.\r\n\r\nI have been informed by an old Barbuda fisherman that “the weeds which\r\nfloat on the surface of the Sargasso Sea grow in large quantities\r\non the bottom of the shoal waters to the north and eastward of that\r\nisland and Antigua.” Consequently, the currents of that region carry\r\nsuch weeds as become detached from their places of growth into the\r\nhigher latitudes, where the westerly winds in the winter season drift\r\nthem eastward south of Bermuda, until finally the central area of\r\ntheir gathering, where the most dense collection of weeds is found, is\r\nsituated near the tropic of Cancer, and about 55° west longitude, as\r\nshown on map No. 2.\r\n\r\nThis position is also the centre of the great circular currents which\r\nencompass the Sargasso Sea. The comparatively few weeds which enter\r\nthe Gulf Stream abreast Florida are currented to the northward of\r\nthe Bermuda Islands, and from thence drifted by the westerly winds\r\nto the south-west of the Azores before entering the trade-wind belt.\r\nThe weeds, on their long drift from their native shoals, hold their\r\nfreshness, and continue to grow while floating on the sea for a\r\nconsiderable time, but at length lose their renovating properties, and\r\nin certain areas of the sea acquire an appearance of age and decay.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream, and such other tropical waters as are attracted\r\nnorthward to the low sea-level abreast the North American coast, pass\r\ninto the westerly wind-belt, and so gradually become drift currents,\r\nwhile being forced by the winds over to the European side of the ocean,\r\nas we have previously shown.\r\n\r\nThe vast movement of the North Atlantic waters encircling the great\r\nSargasso Sea has often been pointed out by writers on the subject. But\r\nthe central and most dense portion of the vast sea of weeds has always\r\nbeen placed on the charts several degrees of longitude east of its true\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIt is fifteen years since I wrote of the Gulf Stream and arctic\r\ncurrents as being attracted to a low sea-level caused by the westerly\r\nwinds. But, as far as I know, writers on the Atlantic currents have\r\nhad nothing to say of the great low sea-level caused by the westerly\r\nwinds blowing the surface waters of the North Atlantic away from the\r\neastern coast of North America, from Georgia to Newfoundland, and thus\r\nattracting the arctic and Gulf Stream waters in opposite directions,\r\nfifteen hundred miles along the North American coast. For, were it\r\nnot for this low sea-level, the Gulf Stream would not be able to move\r\nso far northward as it now flows, but would spread out, were there no\r\nunevenness in the sea-level of the Atlantic, and become a drift current\r\nfar south of its present northern limits. The United States government\r\nhas caused surveys to be made of the Gulf Stream, and the interesting\r\ndiscoveries thus obtained have all been laid before the public. Still,\r\nsuch surveys cover but a portion of the whole round of the vast\r\nmovement of the Gulf Stream water, and do not refer to the vast high\r\nsea-level of the calm belt as being one of its feeders, or to the wide\r\ndisturbance of the surface waters of the tropical North Atlantic in\r\ntheir conflict with the trade winds, while being forced to the vast\r\nhigh sea-level of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, and so giving\r\nhead to the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nThus from the foregoing explanations it will be seen that the ability\r\nof the prevailing winds to move the surface waters of the ocean away\r\nfrom the weather shores of continents over against the opposite leeward\r\nshores in the different wind-belts of the globe, and so cause both high\r\nand low sea-levels, is the main reason why there is an interchange of\r\nsurface water between the tropical and colder zones sufficient to carry\r\nheat from the tropics to the cooler regions, and thus largely affect\r\nthe temperature of the higher latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe unmistakable traces of cold periods having occurred in both\r\nhemispheres have given rise to an ingenious astronomical theory to\r\naccount for their origin. According to this theory the ice periods\r\nin the two hemispheres were consecutive; and it is admitted by its\r\nsupporters that, should it be shown that the frigid periods in the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres were concurrent, the astronomical\r\ndoctrine would have to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a person who is acquainted with the great surface\r\ncurrents of the several oceans to conceive how a mild period could be\r\nmaintained in the northern hemisphere with a frigid period existing\r\nin the southern hemisphere. A frigid period in the latter hemisphere\r\nnecessitates a cold temperature for the superior oceans of the globe\r\nsouth of the equator. With this vast area of water reduced to a\r\nchilling temperature, it seems impossible for the inferior waters of\r\nthe northern latitudes to maintain sufficient warmth to favor a mild\r\nperiod in the northern hemisphere, especially with both hemispheres\r\nreceiving an equal annual amount of the sun’s rays. The great Humboldt\r\ncurrent, having its rise in the southern ocean west of Cape Horn,\r\nwould during a southern frigid period greatly lower the temperature\r\nof the vast equatorial stream in the Pacific Ocean. Consequently, the\r\nJapanese stream, which branches off from the equatorial current into\r\nthe North Pacific, would be cooled to such a degree that it would be\r\nunable to maintain the mild climate on the shores of the North Pacific\r\nwhich extensive lands now enjoy. Furthermore, during a cold period in\r\nthe southern hemisphere the temperature of the Gulf Stream would also\r\nbe greatly lowered by the great South-eastern Atlantic return current,\r\nwhich is caused by the south-east trade winds impelling the surface\r\nwaters of that region into the equatorial latitudes, such waters\r\nbeing replenished from the common level of the southern ocean, and so\r\nmingling the cool waters of that sea with the equatorial waters of the\r\nAtlantic during a frigid period in the southern latitudes. And it may\r\nbe said that during such times the frigid Antarctic Ocean would send\r\nits cold under-currents to cool the inferior northern oceans. Even\r\nto-day the northern and southern hemispheres, through the intermingling\r\nof the waters of the northern and southern oceans, largely maintain\r\na like temperature in their temperate zones. Therefore, when we\r\nconsider the certain traces of ice-sheets having formed on South\r\nAfrica and Southern Australia, and to have overrun South America above\r\nthe latitude of 40° south, thus strewing the oceans of the southern\r\ntemperate zone with ice that are now largely free from it, it seems\r\nthat the maintenance of warm oceans in the northern hemisphere during\r\nthe time of a frigid period in the southern hemisphere would be\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this statement more plain, I will again refer to the\r\nimportance of the great Humboldt current for cooling the waters of\r\nthe North Pacific during the perfection of a southern ice age. For\r\nduring such times the ocean strewed with ice west of Cape Horn, where\r\nthe Humboldt current takes its rise, would impart its coldness to the\r\nHumboldt stream, while it was floating icebergs toward the equator. The\r\nequatorial current of the Pacific being a continuation of the Humboldt\r\nstream, its waters would partake of its coldness. The Japanese current,\r\nbeing a large offshoot from the equatorial stream, would also possess a\r\nlower temperature than it obtains at this age. Yet at this date, with\r\nthe southern ice-sheets confined to the antarctic lands, it does not\r\npossess heat sufficient to prevent glaciers from flowing down to the\r\ntide-water from mountains in Alaska.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Japanese stream could not maintain a mild climate on\r\nthe North Pacific coasts while a cold period was being completed in the\r\nsouthern hemispheres. Therefore, under the conditions above set forth\r\nthe support of a mild period in the northern hemisphere during the\r\nexistence of a frigid period in the southern hemisphere could not be\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been explained, it will be seen that the growth of an\r\nice period is necessarily slow, especially in its early stage, and also\r\nthat the storage of ice is carried on in both hemispheres at the same\r\ntime; but I will call further attention to the southern hemisphere,\r\nbecause it possesses greater resources than the northern for the\r\nproduction of an ice age.\r\n\r\nThe independent circulation of the southern ocean waters, as before\r\nshown, turns away the tropical currents, and thus largely prevents\r\ntheir warm waters from entering the high southern latitudes.\r\nConsequently, the heat from the sun’s rays, and all other sources of\r\nheat included, are not sufficient to prevent ice from gathering on\r\nlands within the antarctic circle. This increasing storage of ice is\r\nonly another name for the accumulation and spreading of cold, and so\r\nthe increasing chillness goes on. The snow falls, and thus adds to the\r\nextension and thickness of the ice-sheets; and at the same time the\r\nspreading snow-fields reflect the heat received from the sun’s rays\r\ninto space, while the cold is retained and increased in the growing\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nThe spreading ice-sheets having covered the land are able to flow into\r\nthe surrounding seas, where their outer edges become detached and form\r\nicebergs, which float out to sea, and so scatter over the adjoining\r\noceans. Thus their coldness is mingled with and largely preserved by\r\nthe sea, while the surface water, which is carried into the southern\r\nlatitudes from the northern oceans by the prevailing winds, and also\r\nsuch surface waters as are attracted into the antarctic seas because\r\nof the difference of temperature of the antarctic waters and the\r\nmore northern seas, are on gaining the frigid latitudes made cool,\r\nand returned to the more northern seas in cold under-currents, and\r\nso chilling the vast under-waters of the great oceans of the globe,\r\nand eventually their wide surface waters also; and so the coldness\r\nincreases until the ice-sheets which at first formed on polar lands are\r\nenabled to spread slowly toward the equatorial regions so long as the\r\nindependent circulation of the southern ocean is maintained.\r\n\r\nBut at length the depth of the great southern ocean is diminished\r\nbecause of the water evaporated from its surface, and precipitated in\r\nthe shape of hail and snow over the vast continents and islands of the\r\nhigh northern latitudes, thus adding sufficient weight to the northern\r\nlands to attract the waters of the southern seas and still further\r\nlessen their depth. Thus during such times the Cape Horn channel is so\r\nreduced as to be obstructed by the heavy glaciers and icebergs of an\r\nice age.\r\n\r\nConsequently, a great change is wrought in the circulation of the\r\nsouthern seas. For, when the Cape Horn channel is closed, the westerly\r\nwinds employ their strength to force the ocean’s surface waters away\r\nfrom the glaciers which have filled the diminished channel. This\r\npotent action of the winds necessarily creates a great low sea-level\r\non the Atlantic side of the obstructed strait, sufficient to attract\r\nthe tropical waters heaped against Brazil by the trade winds, and the\r\nwaters of the high sea-level of the equatorial calm belt, and also the\r\nequatorial waters which set along the east coast of Africa, well into\r\nthe southern seas.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the conditions for the circulation of the\r\ntropical ocean waters have met with a great change.\r\n\r\nBut the temperature of the waters has been lowered by the coldness of a\r\nfrigid period; and, consequently, their capability for conveying heat\r\nto the high latitudes has largely diminished. Therefore, their first\r\ninroads in the higher latitudes make small impression on the icy seas,\r\nso the early process for melting ice is exceedingly slow. But the icy\r\nsouthern ocean, deprived of its independent circulation, in the course\r\nof time yields to the warming invasion of the tropical waters, whose\r\nwide and increasing spread is eventually able to bring about a mild\r\nperiod, according to the natural methods which I have explained in the\r\npreceding pages.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be said that a mild period succeeding a glacial age gained\r\nsufficient warmth to melt the ice-sheets from all lands excepting the\r\nhighest mountains. For it is probable that there are lands situated in\r\nthe antarctic circle sufficiently elevated even during late Tertiary\r\ntimes to have been above the snow-line. Therefore, the glaciers on\r\nsuch lands could not have melted away during mild periods succeeding\r\nan ice age. For, as has been explained, a portion of the waters of the\r\nsouthern seas had moved into the northern hemisphere. Consequently, the\r\nantarctic lands were raised higher above the sea-level than at this\r\nage. Hence the area of lofty land was increased above the snow-line.\r\nAnd, according to Dr. James Croll’s estimate, the ice-sheet at the\r\nsouth pole is at this age several miles in thickness. Therefore, its\r\nupper surface is above the line of perpetual snow, and could not be\r\nmelted away during the warm eras succeeding glacial periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE SPREAD OF GLACIERS DURING COLD EPOCHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have before explained that the conditions are such that the cold\r\nperiods of the northern and southern hemispheres were concurrent.\r\nThrough this cause, while the glacial epoch was being perfected, the\r\nice followed down the mountain ranges of both hemispheres; and, while\r\ngathering on the lands of the temperate latitudes, it also spread\r\nover a portion of the tropical zone. It is reported that traces of\r\nancient glaciers are found in India, and also in Central America and\r\nin tropical South America. In fact, the denudation caused by ancient\r\nglaciers on the elevated lands of the tropics are too well defined to\r\nbe attributed to any process of weathering, while Alpine plants of the\r\nsame species are found near the summits of mountains in the tropics as\r\nwell as in the high latitudes of both hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThis fact goes to show that a portion of the lowlands of the tropical\r\nzone have experienced a temperature favorable for the growth of Alpine\r\nplants. And, judging from the tropical islands I have visited, situated\r\nin the cold currents which flow down the eastern sides of the oceans\r\nfrom the high latitudes, I think they show strong traces of having\r\nduring some remote period been subject to the action of glaciers. The\r\nisland of St. Helena, situated in the southern tropical Atlantic, has\r\nthe appearance of having been heavily iced during a frigid age. Its\r\nsteep ravines, which deepen as they approach the sea, recall to the\r\nsouthern voyager the ice-worn islands of the high latitudes. It seems\r\nimprobable that these deep ravines which penetrate the hard volcanic\r\nrock, on their short course to the sea, could have been caused by their\r\nscanty brooklets.\r\n\r\nThe bowlders scattered over the island are not in harmony with the\r\nweathering process, while the obliteration of its craters seems to\r\npoint to a more rapid process of erosion than could be attributed to\r\nweathering.\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz, in his “General Sketch of the Expedition of the\r\n‘Albatross,’” states that the Galapagos Islands are of volcanic origin,\r\nand that their age does not reach beyond the earliest Tertiary period;\r\nand his report seems to favor the impression of their having undergone\r\ndenudation sufficient to slough off large portions of the rims of the\r\nolder craters, and also the eastern face of Wenman Island. On Hood’s\r\nIsland, at the time of my visit, its crater had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe highest portion of the island, which was the probable site of\r\nits ancient crater, showed no trace of its former existence; yet at\r\nthe foot of this low mountain, on its southern side, I saw a large\r\ncollection of loose bowlders, composed of hard volcanic rock, which\r\nwere mostly free from soil and other débris, and easily moved from\r\ntheir places, while the spaces afforded by the loose piles of dark\r\nbasaltic rocks afforded a secure retreat for numerous owls and lizards.\r\nBeyond the rocky piles to the southward a horizontal area of land was\r\nstrewn with bowlders to the sea, which was some two miles distant from\r\nthe higher land. The bowlders which covered the plain were somewhat\r\nsmaller than those at the foot of the mountain, as none of the former\r\nwere more than three or four feet in their longest measurement.\r\n\r\nThey seem to have been formed from thin strata of lava, which were\r\nbroken in pieces from pressure, such as the action of ice could\r\nperform. In fact, the crowded and angular and somewhat worn blocks\r\nof lava presented a different appearance from stones thrown from the\r\ncrater of a volcano, while no such bowlders are found among the recent\r\nvolcanic eruptions on the islands.\r\n\r\nThe plain so thickly strewn with bowlders, and partly shaded by a tall\r\ngrowth of shrubs, fell off abruptly at the seaside, forming a steep\r\ncliff some two hundred feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe rocky floor at the foot of the cliff received such débris as fell\r\nfrom the sea-washed land; yet it contained few bowlders, they having\r\nbeen washed away by the waves soon after falling.\r\n\r\nAt one place a steep, dry ravine penetrated the land from the seashore,\r\nwhich was dangerous to cross on account of the loose stones resting\r\non its sides. Two or three miles further west, on the level land\r\nbordering the sea, a large rookery of albatross were brooding their\r\neggs and chicklings. The land on the south side of Albemarle, near the\r\nsea, consists of débris from the eroded high lands; and, judging from\r\nthe crumbling cliffs by the sea, it seems that the land at one time\r\nextended further seaward.\r\n\r\nBesides the excessive denudation which appears to have taken place on\r\nportions of these bowlder-strewn lands, we have other unmistakable\r\ntestimony of their having formerly possessed a frigid temperature. The\r\ncharacteristic Alpine flora of these islands points to a time when they\r\nwere exposed to a cold climate. Furthermore, rookeries of seal and\r\nalbatross, which naturally belong to shores situated in cold latitudes,\r\nstill exist on these equatorial islands; and, when we consider the\r\nfavorable position of the Galapagos for the reception of cold during a\r\nfrigid period, we can well account for the lingering signs which point\r\nto their former cold climate.\r\n\r\nDuring the perfection of an ice period the western shore of South\r\nAmerica was covered with an ice-sheet from the summits of its mountain\r\nrange to the sea, extending northward as far as the latitude of 38°\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThis vast ice-sheet, situated in a region of great snow-fall, was\r\nconstantly sending icebergs into the sea, where they were borne\r\nnorthward by the cold Humboldt current directly toward the Galapagos\r\nIslands; while, on the other hand, in the northern latitudes, in\r\nregions of great snow-fall, such as Alaska and British America,\r\nnumerous icebergs were launched into the ocean, to be currented\r\nsouthward to the Galapagos seas. Thus during the frigid epoch the\r\nequatorial waters surrounding the Galapagos group was one of the\r\ngreatest gathering places for floating ice to be found on the globe.\r\n\r\nAnd here the frigidity stored up in the glaciers of the higher\r\nlatitudes was set free, thus chilling the waters as well as the\r\natmosphere of that region. The Alpine flora of the American coast\r\nmountains was probably carried by floating ice to the Galapagos, while\r\nits rookeries of albatross and seal date back to a cold period. And\r\nit seems that these cold-weather animals, with the assistance of the\r\ncool Humboldt current, may be able to preserve their rookeries at the\r\nequator until the advent of another ice period. In connection with the\r\nevidences of a cold climate having possessed the Galapagos, there are\r\nample traces of ice-sheets having flowed over a large portion of the\r\nhigh lands of tropical America, and in some places the ice may have\r\nflowed down to the sea, especially where the large rivers now empty;\r\nand it is said that masses of clay, mixed with sub-angular stones, have\r\nbeen found in Brazil, which goes to prove the glaciation of portions of\r\nthat tropical land during a remote age. Professor Louis J. R. Agassiz,\r\nduring his research in the Amazon valley, found bowlders resting near\r\nthe summits of the low hills of that region, which he attributed to\r\nthe action of ice. The spread of glaciers on southern continents and\r\nislands is shown on map No. 1.\r\n\r\nIn _Science_, Nov. 17, 1893, Mr. J. Crawford published a summary of\r\nhis discoveries in Nicaragua, during ten months of nearly continuous\r\nexploration since August, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe author of this report says: “The numerous eroded mountain\r\nridges and lateral terminal moraines of that tropical region give\r\nunquestionable evidences of the former existence of a glacial epoch,\r\nwhich covered an area of several thousand square miles in Nicaragua\r\nwith glacial ice. The ice-sheet covered a large part of the existing\r\nnarrow divide of land (containing about 48,000 square miles) between\r\nthe Pacific and Caribbean Sea.” And it is likely that other large areas\r\nof tropical America were glaciated at the same time, especially in\r\nregions of great precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe island of Cuba, during a portion of the ice age, probably\r\nsupported heavy glaciers, and obtained an average temperature as low\r\nas South-western New Zealand at this age. According to the description\r\ngiven by J. W. Spencer, of the Cuban land, great valleys have been\r\nexcavated, the lower portion of which are now fiords, reaching in one\r\ncase at least to seven thousand feet in depth before gaining the sea\r\nbeyond. Thus, while keeping in view the glacial condition of Central\r\nAmerica during the frigid period, it seems that the great Cuban\r\nexcavations were partly the work of glaciers of the same cold epoch.*\r\nJudging from such reliable statements, it is probable that the climate\r\nof tropical America during the frigid age was somewhat colder than\r\nobtained in the tropical regions of the eastern continent, owing to\r\nthe wide connection of the Atlantic with the Arctic Ocean as well as\r\nwith the antarctic seas, and because of its shores possessing a larger\r\narea of glaciated lands in proportion to its size than the Pacific and\r\nIndian Oceans, and also owing to the tropical Atlantic containing so\r\nsmall a portion of the world’s waters which lie within the torrid zone,\r\nand its equatorial current being separated by continental lands from\r\nthe great equatorial stream of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\r\n\r\n        *The meeting of the British Association for the Advancement\r\n    of Science, September, 1895, was reported in _Science_ of\r\n    October 18, where mention is made of an interesting paper by\r\n    Mr. R. B. White, on “The Glacial Age of Tropical America,” in\r\n    which he described a number of apparently glacial deposits in\r\n    the Republic of Colombia, almost under the equator. He spoke\r\n    of moraines forming veritable mountains, immense thicknesses\r\n    of bowlder clay, breccias, cement beds, sand, gravels, and\r\n    clays, beds of loess, valleys scooped, grooved, and terraced,\r\n    monstrous erratics, and traces of great avalanches.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the tropical Atlantic waters must have been reduced to a\r\nlower temperature during a frigid age than the tropical waters of the\r\nIndian Ocean or the western part of the tropical Pacific, as a large\r\nportion of the great equatorial current of the latter oceans, during\r\nits western movement, was exposed to the rays of a tropical sun for a\r\nmuch longer time, after being replenished by the cold waters of the\r\nhigh latitudes, than the tropical currents of the Atlantic; and it\r\nis probable that, on account of tropical America possessing a colder\r\nclimate than the tropical lands of the eastern continent during the\r\nfrigid epoch, the cold of the western continent was more destructive\r\nto its fauna and flora than was the case in the tropical regions of\r\nthe eastern continent. Professor Wright, in his valuable work on “The\r\nIce Age of North America,” gives a good description of the “flight\r\nof plants and animals during the glacial epoch,” and also of the\r\nextermination of many superior species because of the frigid climate.\r\n\r\nThe high lands of tropical Africa, above the altitude of three thousand\r\nfeet, and situated in places of great precipitation, were probably\r\ncovered with snow and ice during the glacial age. Travellers have\r\nreported that islands composed partly of granite bowlders are found\r\nin the lakes at the head-waters of the Nile. But the glaciers that\r\ninvaded the tropical latitudes were of short duration compared with the\r\nice-sheets that burdened the lands of the temperate zones. Besides,\r\nsuch tropical ice as flowed to the low lands was so near a melting\r\ncondition that it made small impression on the rocks; but on steep\r\nmountain slopes, where the movement of the ice was comparatively rapid,\r\nit possessed considerable eroding power. The climate of the tropical\r\nzone on both continents during the perfection of an ice period was so\r\ncold that such animals as could not endure a low temperature retreated\r\ninto the warmest regions of the equatorial latitudes, while many\r\nspecies who failed to reach such places perished. And especially was\r\nthis the case with the pre-glacial fauna of the western continent. Mr.\r\nW. B. M. Davidson, in his treatise on Florida phosphates, says: “The\r\ngreat mammal hordes of the glacial epoch were driven into Florida in\r\ntheir flight southward for life and warmth, and there perished because\r\nof the deadly cold which ever moved southward. The Florida waters\r\ngrew so icy cold, fishes, reptiles, and mammoth animals died, and\r\nadded their frames and teeth to the valley of bones now found in that\r\nsouthern region.”\r\n\r\nSuch species of the tropical fauna of the ocean as survived the ice age\r\ncould have existed only in torrid seas with small connection with the\r\ncold oceans during the frigid epochs. For, with the diminished oceans\r\nof a cold period, it seems that the conditions were favorable for the\r\nmaintenance of such seas in the region of the East India Islands.\r\n\r\nSuch parts of Southern Europe and Northern Africa as bordered on the\r\nMediterranean Sea probably possessed a milder climate during the ice\r\nage than regions in the same latitudes on the Atlantic coast, for the\r\nreason that the North Atlantic was proportionally a greater receptacle\r\nfor icebergs which were launched into it from the numerous glaciers of\r\nNorth-eastern America, Greenland, Iceland, and North-western Europe\r\nthan the great inland sea obtained from its less frigid shores. And it\r\nmay have happened that during such times the tropical waters of the\r\nIndian Ocean had some connection with the Mediterranean through the\r\nRed Sea and Suez, and so during portions of the year the waters of the\r\ntropical Indian Ocean were forced by the periodical winds into the\r\ninland sea. It is the opinion of several writers that man, along with\r\nother species of animal life, existed previous to the glacial period;\r\nfor, since the seas and lands of the globe were chilled, the conditions\r\nseem to have been less favorable for the spontaneous generation of\r\nanimate bodies than during the previous warm ages. Therefore, it\r\nappears that the generative ages should be ascribed to the long genial\r\neras prior to the glacial epochs. For it is probable that the lower\r\nparts of the ocean, which now possess a low temperature even in the\r\ntropical latitudes, were, during the warm eras, wholly composed of warm\r\nwater, because the surface waters of the antarctic seas of that age,\r\nwhich supply the great under-currents of the ocean, would possess a\r\nhigh temperature; and it is probable that the temperature of a large\r\nportion of the seas of the torrid zone was for a long time maintained\r\nat blood heat. For it should be considered that the waters which moved\r\nfrom the torrid seas, after making their journey through the warm\r\nregions of the high latitudes, would on their return to the tropics\r\nretain a large portion of the heat they acquired in the torrid zone\r\nbefore making their journey to the mild polar regions.\r\n\r\nAnd, when we reflect how the heat of the sun’s rays was conserved by\r\nthe ocean waters, and that their circulation during such times was\r\nalmost wholly performed by the winds, as the difference of temperature\r\nbetween the polar latitudes and the equator was small, it appears\r\nthat during the eras previous to the glacial age the oceans must have\r\nobtained a higher temperature than possessed by the warmest seas of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nAccording to the discoveries of Professor Wright and others, ancient\r\nstone implements have been found beneath the glacial drift, as well\r\nas the bones of animals whose descendants are now living, which goes\r\nto prove that man, with other species of fauna which now inhabit the\r\nearth, existed anterior to the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nAnd on consideration it seems unreasonable to suppose that any of the\r\nsuperior species of animals could have been brought into existence\r\nsince the waters and lands of the earth were chilled by the cold of\r\na glacial age. And it appears that many species of animals which\r\nare known to have survived the cold periods were indebted for such\r\nsurvivals to the slow process through which a frigid period is brought\r\nabout, thus affording time for evolutionary inurement to the slow\r\nincrease of cold which at length perfects a glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nThe inurement to cold acquired by animals during the glacial age is\r\nstill an attribute possessed by many species of fauna to-day. For, when\r\na warm climate took possession of the tropical zone, it was deserted\r\nby a large portion of the animals that found refuge there during the\r\nglacial age.\r\n\r\nThus, while the seas and shores of the cooler latitudes swarm with\r\nanimate bodies, the torrid latitudes seem comparatively lonely to the\r\nvoyagers on the tropical oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIERS OF THE TEMPERATE ZONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving asserted that during the culmination of a frigid period the\r\nice-sheets spread over a portion of the lands of the tropical zone,\r\nI will give my views, with those of several writers, on the spread\r\nof ice-sheets within the now temperate latitudes; and meanwhile I\r\nwill repeat a portion of my former essays on the subject. Professor\r\nHitchcock, in his lectures on the early history of North America,\r\nsays that “the history opens with igneous agency in the ascendant,\r\naqueous and organic forces become conspicuous later on, and ice has\r\nput on the finishing touches to the terrestrial contours.” But there\r\nappear to be various opinions held by geologists respecting the changes\r\nbrought about on the earth’s surface during the glacial period. Some\r\nthink that glaciers have never been an important geological agent,\r\nwhile others assert that during the glacial epoch heavy ice-sheets\r\ncovered the elevated portions of Western North America as far south\r\nas the thirty-sixth parallel of latitude, and Eastern North America\r\nwas overspread with ice-sheets, which attained a depth of five or six\r\nthousand feet, and were able to move their débris over wide lands of\r\nlittle declivity toward the sea, their immense deposits forming the\r\nlands of Cape Cod, and also the islands of Nantucket and Martha’s\r\nVineyard.\r\n\r\nBut it is now said that this implied magnitude of the glacial deposits\r\non the lands skirting the New England coast is without foundation,\r\nsince the larger bulk of these islands consists of upturned Cretaceous\r\nand Tertiary strata, which are only thinly covered with glacial débris,\r\nsuch as bowlders, gravel, clay, and sand, from the eroded shores of the\r\nmainland of New England. But it appears that the dislocated and folded\r\ncretaceous strata which underlie the glacial drift of Nantucket and\r\nMartha’s Vineyard were during an early period deposited on the bottom\r\nof a shallow sea, which then covered the Vineyard Sound, Buzzard’s Bay,\r\nand their surrounding lowlands. Thus the ice-sheets of the frigid age\r\nwhich moved over New England displaced the yielding stratified deposits\r\nof the shallow sea, and forced them southward in a disturbed condition\r\nto the position which they now occupy.\r\n\r\nStill, it is apparent that only a small portion of the glacial drift is\r\nfound on these islands, which, according to appearances, must have been\r\neroded and moved southward from the rocky lands of New England during\r\nthe ice age; but there is sufficient to show that large quantities\r\nof such débris were carried over the islands into the Atlantic. And,\r\njudging from the eroded rocky New England lands, there must have been\r\nsufficient glacial drift moved over Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard\r\ninto the ocean beyond to far exceed in bulk the deranged Tertiary and\r\nCretaceous deposits which now form so large a portion of the islands.\r\n\r\nFor, when we look over lands bearing traces of the ice age, where\r\nthe glaciers did not move their drift into the sea, so the terminal\r\nmoraines of such glaciers can be better estimated, we can realize the\r\ngreat work that has been performed by the ice-sheet that overran New\r\nEngland during a frigid age.\r\n\r\nProfessor James Geikie states, in his discussion on the glacial\r\ndeposits of Northern Italy, that the deposits from Alpine glaciers of a\r\nfrigid period “rise out of the plains of Piedmont as steep hills to a\r\nheight of fifteen hundred feet, and in one place to nearly two thousand\r\nfeet. Measured along its outer circumference, this great morainic mass\r\nis found to have a frontage of fifty miles, while the plain which it\r\nencloses extends some fifteen miles from Andrate southward.” And it\r\nis reported that there are found on the southern flank of the Jura\r\nnumerous scattered bowlders, all of which have been carried from the\r\nAlps across the intervening plains, and left where they now rest. Many\r\ncontain thousands of cubic feet, and not a few are quite as large as\r\ncottages.\r\n\r\nSuch blocks are found on the Jura, at a height of no less than two\r\nthousand feet above the Lake of Neuchâtel. The Jura Mountains being\r\nformed of limestone, it is easy to distinguish the débris deposited\r\nby Alpine glaciers; and, from what I can learn of extensive glacial\r\nwork, it appears that intervening plains, lakes, and sounds are so\r\noften found separating the source of ancient glaciers from their\r\ndeposits that their existence becomes almost necessary to represent\r\nthe general outlines of disturbance performed during an ice period. In\r\nconsideration of such facts and the foregoing statements of reliable\r\nobservers, I am prompted to offer my views on glacial work performed on\r\na portion of the Pacific shores of North America, which seems to me to\r\nbe much more extensive than hitherto supposed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney describes the coast mountains of California as being\r\nmade up of great disturbances, which have been brought about within\r\ngeologically recent times; and this statement I found to be so obvious\r\nin my travels over that region that it appears to me that the coast\r\nranges originated in a different manner from the older Sierras. The\r\nwestern sides of the latter mountains everywhere show the great eroding\r\npower of ancient glaciers; and, when I considered their favorable\r\nposition for the accumulation of snow during a glacial period, I was\r\nled to seek for the glacial deposits adequate to represent the great\r\ngathering of ice which an age of frigid temperature would produce.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed to me that such deposits could not be found in the\r\nfoot-hills of the Sierras, which contain the moraine of inferior\r\nice-sheets that terminated at the base of the mountains.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions I came to the conclusion that during the earlier\r\nice period the immense glaciers which must have formed on the western\r\nslopes of the Sierra range moved their gigantic accumulation of débris\r\nso far seaward as to form the range of hills now existing next the\r\ncoast line, and perhaps the islands abreast the Santa Barbara coast,\r\nthe Contra Costa, or eastern range, being formed during a subsequent\r\nice period, in the same manner as the hills next the coast line.\r\n\r\nStill, it may be that neither of the coast ranges was the work of a\r\nsingle cold epoch; but the western range must necessarily have been the\r\nearliest deposit. Although the coast ranges differ from the Sierras\r\nin their make up, yet it does not disagree with the glacial origin\r\nof the former inferior mountains, from the fact that the ice-sheets,\r\nwhile moving their bulk westward, displaced the deposits of such bays,\r\nlakes, rivers, and marshes as lay abreast of the Sierra slopes. The\r\nadvancing ice-sheets, thousands of feet in depth, moving from a lofty\r\nand steep incline, pressed and ploughed below the somewhat superficial\r\ncretaceous and alluvial strata which lay in their course. The disturbed\r\nstrata, while forced along in confused heaps in front of the ice, were\r\namassed in ridges sufficient to form the hills of the coast ranges.\r\nThe bowlders found imbedded in several of the coast hills must have\r\nbeen moved by the ice from the Sierras on account of the coast ranges\r\nnot having a rocky core of sufficient firmness to give shape to such\r\nbowlders. Moreover, the temperature of the Pacific waters would not be\r\nfavorable for glaciers to form on the coast ranges, with the ice-sheets\r\nof the Sierras terminating at the foot-hills.\r\n\r\nThe Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys are now covered by recent river\r\ndeposits. Therefore, the glacial drift which should be traced from the\r\nSierras to the coast ranges is concealed.\r\n\r\nYet the abraded appearance of exposed solid rocks at the base of the\r\nfoot-hills, and also the scattered bowlders which gradually disappear\r\nbeneath the diluvial deposits of the plains, indicate that the Sierra\r\nice-sheets could not have ended at the foot-hills, but must have moved\r\nfurther westward, while gathering immense accumulations in their front,\r\nsufficient to form the coast hills, the débris thus amassed being able\r\nto arrest the further movement of the ice seaward.\r\n\r\nThe coast ranges in several places have been subject to igneous action,\r\nwhich may have been brought about through heat generated from pressure\r\nexerted on the interior masses after the ice had melted away, the heat\r\nthus produced being sufficient to cause outbursts of lava, where the\r\nnature of the material favored combustion. The low plains, lakes, and\r\nbays which separate the Sierras from the coast hills are in a position\r\nsimilar to the shallow sounds which separate Nantucket, Martha’s\r\nVineyard, and Long Island from the inferior slopes of the mountains of\r\nNew England. Therefore, while agreeing with glacialists, who believe\r\nthat great geological changes have been wrought by ice-sheets in Italy\r\nand New England, it appears to me that the ancient glaciers of the\r\nSierra Nevada have accomplished more extensive work, owing to the\r\nSierras being situated in a more favorable position to receive the\r\nhumidity of the ocean.\r\n\r\nHence, with a low temperature, vast quantities of snow must have\r\ncollected on their lofty sides; and at the same time their great\r\nheight and declivity would cause the ice to move down their steeps\r\nwith greater force than the glaciers which passed over New England.\r\nWriters who have given the subject considerable study think that the\r\ndeep valleys of the Sierra Nevada were produced by disruptive rather\r\nthan erosive agencies. This conclusion has been formed from the lack\r\nof large accumulations of débris about their lower extremities, which\r\nwould not be the case if such valleys were the result of glacial\r\nerosion. But, should the coast ranges be attributed to glacial action,\r\nas has been stated, we can well account for the débris that should\r\naccumulate from the erosion of the deep valleys.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that could prevent the ice from gathering on the Sierra\r\nNevada range during an ice period in greater masses than on any\r\nmountains in the northern hemisphere would be the lack of cold; for,\r\nwith a low temperature, the fall of snow would be enormous. This is\r\nshown by the great snow-fall during the short mild winters of to-day.\r\nTherefore, with ice-sheets covering a large portion of the lands of\r\nthe high northern latitudes, and with the Japanese current which\r\ntempers the north Pacific waters made cold in the manner described\r\nin the foregoing pages, and while the sea along the north-west coast\r\nof America was strewn with icebergs launched from Alaska and British\r\nColumbia, it seems that California must also have obtained a frigid\r\nclimate during the ice age. Therefore, on account of its exposure to\r\nthe ocean winds, and the consequent heavy snow-fall, the accumulation\r\nof ice on its lands must have been immense. For, when it is considered\r\nthat the glaciers of North America extended southward even into the\r\ntorrid zone sufficient to cover a large portion of Central America,\r\nit is unreasonable to suppose that any portion of California could\r\nescape being covered by heavy ice-sheets during the glacial epoch. The\r\ncomparatively scant fall of rain and snow over Greenland is known to\r\nform ice-sheets hundreds of feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what must have been the depth of ice over the high lands of\r\nthe Pacific coast north of California at the culmination of a frigid\r\nperiod? The descriptions given by Dr. Dawson and others, of glacial\r\nphenomena along that coast, favor the impression that an immense\r\nice-sheet at one time deeply covered the whole region from the top of\r\nthe mountain range to the ocean.\r\n\r\nThus all the deep channels were filled and all the islands deeply\r\noverrun with ice, while the immense bergs launched from the shore\r\nand carried by the winds and currents southward were probably not\r\nmelted until they reached the tropical latitudes. Thus, when the\r\nwhole circulation of the Pacific waters are taken into account, it\r\nwill be seen that their temperature during the ice age must have been\r\nconsiderably lowered. The movement of ice-sheets on the Pacific slope\r\nwas probably local in character, and not connected with the movement of\r\nice on the eastern sides of the mountains.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have seen of the vast territory lying between the Sierra\r\nNevada and the Rocky Mountains it appears that it obtained much heavier\r\nice-fields than generally supposed. Professor Geikie in his lectures\r\nsays of this region that during the glacial age, “in the Second\r\nColorado Canyon, the sides were completely glaciated from bottom to\r\ntop. These walls are from 800 to 1,000 feet high, and at the thickest\r\npoint the glacier was 1,700 feet thick”; and he says that “the country\r\naround Salt Lake was covered with ice, for the rocks about there show\r\nthe action of ice, and that the bones of the musk-ox are found there.”\r\nThis vast area of ancient ice, although subject to little movement in\r\nits interior basin, still, in whatever movement it may have had, must\r\nhave found its main outlet through the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.\r\n\r\nFor in no other way can we account for the erosive forces necessary to\r\nexcavate that immense chasm. Not even the mighty torrent that carried\r\noff the waters of the melting ice-sheets that covered the interior\r\nportion of the continent could accomplish work of such magnitude.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Geikie’s observations the Second Colorado Canyon\r\nwas filled with glaciers during the ice age. Therefore, it seems that\r\nthese glaciers must have flowed down into the Grand Canyon, and there\r\nunited with glaciers flowing from more northern regions.\r\n\r\nAn account of a collecting expedition to Lower California by G. Eison,\r\nin 1895, describes ancient moraines at the extremity of the peninsula\r\nas being prominent, large, and steep. This region lies under the tropic\r\nof Cancer, and 8° south of the mouth of the Colorado River where\r\nit empties into the Gulf of California. Hence it appears that the\r\ntemperature of that portion of North America during the ice age was\r\nfavorable for the great glacier of the Colorado Canyon to have flowed\r\ninto the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nThe wide, shallow basins of Utah and Nevada were filled with the water\r\nfrom the melting ice-sheet on the breaking up of the ice period,\r\nand the lakes so caused remained for a considerable time after the\r\ndisappearance of the ice. But, owing to the great evaporation and light\r\nrain-fall of that region, the lakes gradually shrank away, the filling\r\nand emptying of the lake basins being governed by the cold and mild\r\nepochs.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerate deposits in the Appalachian district of North America\r\nare known as occurring on a large scale. Professor Shaler is inclined\r\nto attribute them to glacial action, because he knows of no other force\r\nthat could bring together such masses of pebbles from a wide-spread\r\nsurface. In Eastern Kentucky and East Tennessee these deposits are\r\nfound to be several hundred feet in thickness. Such accumulations of\r\napparent glacial origin are to be found from New Brunswick to Alabama.\r\n\r\nHence it seems that the ice during a frigid period followed down the\r\nAlleghany range even so far south as Georgia and Alabama; and for a\r\ntime, when the ice attained its greatest spread, it flowed over the\r\ncentral portion of the Gulf States. For how else can we account for the\r\nclay mixed with gravel and pebbles and stony fragments being spread\r\nbroadcast over that region?\r\n\r\nI know that such statements do not agree with the views of glacialists\r\nwho have written on the subject, and have drawn the glacial boundary\r\nfrom seven to ten degrees further north, where a line of bowlders with\r\nother glacial débris is plainly traced. Still, it appears to me that a\r\nline of bowlders deposited by an ice-sheet spreading over a continent\r\nand across many degrees of latitude cannot be compared to the moraines\r\nof inferior mountain glaciers of the temperate latitudes of the present\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAn ice-sheet moving from a high latitude to a lower would, while in the\r\ncolder latitude, freeze firmly to the rocky ledges, and hold them so\r\nstrong in its frigid grasp as to break off the weaker portions of the\r\nrocks, and drag them toward a milder region, as far as the freezing\r\ngrip of the ice-sheet would permit; but, on gaining lower and milder\r\nlatitudes, the holding and dragging power of the ice would be lost on\r\naccount of the increased warmth of the earth over which the glacier\r\nmust pass, and also because of the ice-sheet having lost a portion of\r\nthe low temperature acquired in the higher latitudes. Therefore, on\r\nsuch lines the bowlders would be released, while the ice-sheet would\r\nstill move on, although largely deprived of its eroding power.\r\n\r\nThis is the probable reason why a line of glacial débris, largely\r\ncomposed of bowlders, is found to extend across the Middle and Western\r\nStates, and so generally supposed to be the glacial boundary of a\r\nfrigid period. But there is no reason to suppose that an ice-sheet,\r\nalthough deprived of its eroding power, was arrested in its southern\r\nmovement on the line of its stony débris, because there could be no\r\nsudden change of temperature in a particular latitude on the eastern\r\nlands of North America to cause an abrupt ending of the ice-sheets.\r\nAnd there appears to be nothing to hinder the ice from gathering and\r\nflowing over lands warm enough to loosen its implements of erosion;\r\nfor there is much to show that the ice-sheets flowed much further\r\nsouthward, even into the middle portion of the Gulf States, and there\r\nspread the clay mixed with gravel and pebbles, with now and then a\r\nbowlder, over the land. The scattered bowlders, found in numerous\r\ninstances many miles south of the bowlder line, were so deeply imbedded\r\nin the ice-sheet that they could not be dropped on the usual releasing\r\nground. The ice-sheet, when deprived of its rocky, eroding implements,\r\nwould, while flowing over the land, leave few or no imprints on the\r\nrocks; but it would probably move and spread a large amount of clay,\r\ngravel, pebbles, and sand over its wide course, especially if the ice\r\nmoved from a region abounding with such material.\r\n\r\nShould we place the glacial boundary on the line of the rocky débris,\r\nhow could we account for the glaciated stones found on the hills and\r\nplains situated far southward of the bowlder-strewn regions of the\r\nMiddle and Western States? The clay mixed with gravel and sand, and\r\nspread so broadcast over a large portion of Georgia and even into\r\nNorthern Florida, makes it appear that the ice of a cold period must\r\nhave covered that southern region.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it seems to have been through the great abrasion which only\r\nice-sheets could perform that the sands of the Florida peninsula were\r\nproduced; for on examination they seem to have resulted from the\r\nabrasion and weathering of crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nThe worn remnants of such rocks are now found in the southern\r\nAppalachian range. In fact, the hills and mountains of that region at\r\nthe present time are supposed to be a small remnant of the ancient\r\nhighlands. Thus, on consideration, it appears that the sands caused by\r\nthe action of glaciers were, on the disappearance of ice-sheets, blown\r\nby the strong north-west winds toward the Florida peninsula as fast\r\nas the receding waters of the ocean which flowed the lowlands on the\r\nbreaking up of the ice age would permit; and in this way the sand was\r\nspread over the lowland region, which was largely composed of coral\r\nsea shells and other marine matter. And it seems that the sand must\r\nhave been blown over large areas in Florida soon after the ending of\r\nthe frigid period, because the sand, in order to be moved by the winds,\r\nmust have spread over a country nearly destitute of vegetation; and\r\nsuch would be the condition of that region during times which succeeded\r\nthe ice period and the subsequent brief flowage of the lowlands on the\r\nending of the frigid age, which would not be the case if such sands\r\nresulted entirely from water erosion and weathering, because with\r\nsuch a state of things the country would be covered with forests and\r\ngrasses, which would prevent the sand from being moved by the winds to\r\nany great extent.\r\n\r\nThis goes to show that the region of the Gulf States was so much\r\naffected by the cold of the glacial period, together with the\r\nsubmergence of the lowlands at its close, its flora and also its\r\nanimals were exterminated; for how else can we account for the abundant\r\nfossil remains of animals now found buried in the Florida sands? It\r\nappears also that, when Florida was being covered with drifting sands,\r\nmany of the lake basins now formed did not exist, as the wind-blown\r\nsand could not have crossed a continuous chain of lakes like the St.\r\nJohn’s River; and it is an easy matter to-day to trace the beds of the\r\nancient lakes that prevented the sands from drifting over certain lands\r\nnow nearly destitute of it. And it is probable that the sea flowed the\r\nlowest lands during the period when the winds were drifting the greater\r\nportion of the sands over the peninsula. Therefore, regions which\r\nembrace the Everglades and portions of the Indian River territory are\r\nquite free from heavy sand deposits, and so also are the extensive flat\r\nwoods of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nSince the sands blew over the ancient desert of Florida, many lake\r\nbasins have been formed because of the sinking of the ground. This\r\nsinking of the ground is a common occurrence in limestone regions,\r\nwhere a great amount of material is moved in solution, leaving caverns\r\nwhose roofs often fall in. The great amount of sand blown upon Florida\r\ncaused the marine strata to give way in the weaker places under its\r\nburden. The sinks thus formed, probably of frequent occurrence at one\r\ntime, have now nearly ceased. Still, there are depressions to be seen\r\nto-day where the tops of large pine-trees, which grew on dry, sandy\r\nland, are barely above the surface of the water which partly fills\r\nthe basins so recently formed. Yet I would not assert that all of the\r\ndepressions where Florida lakes exist were caused by the sinking of the\r\nground; for the winds may have caused shallow basins in the sand, where\r\nthe decayed vegetation has formed mud sufficient to hold the water\r\nwhich now partly fills such basins.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of Florida sands can be seen to good advantage when\r\nexposed to a strong, dry north-west wind, where the ground happens\r\nto be destitute of vegetation. An observer can then realize what the\r\nresult would be, should the whole land be deprived of vegetation and\r\nlaid bare to the action of the winds.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, not only would the winds be much stronger than\r\nnow, but the air near the ground would be filled with sand, moving like\r\ndrifting snow in a Dakota blizzard. And, furthermore, it is probable\r\nthat the rainfall was very light while Florida was void of vegetation;\r\nand, even if shallow basins were formed, there would be a lack of rain\r\nto supply them with water.\r\n\r\nThe wide plains west of the Mississippi River, extending southward into\r\nTexas, during the frigid period must have been covered with a sheet\r\nof ice and snow. And it is probable that it was not wholly a product\r\nof more northern latitudes, but was mostly produced by the snow which\r\nfell on the plains during the long winters of that period, which could\r\nnot be melted away during the cold summers of an ice age, when it is\r\nconsidered that an ice-sheet, with a temperature sufficiently low as to\r\ncarry glacial drift, covered the lands of Missouri as far as latitude\r\n38° south; and it may have been through the pressure from an ice-sheet\r\nin its south-eastern movement that we are to account for the numerous\r\nore-bearing faulting fissures traversing the limestone strata.\r\n\r\nThe ice-sheet was also the probable cause of the erosion of the\r\nhorizontal bedded stones, yet it appears that the ice did not greatly\r\nchange the contour of the ground; for it is well known that glaciers\r\ndo move over lands that are not frozen to the ice without causing much\r\ndisturbance, especially where the gradient is small, and this was the\r\nprobable condition of the Western plains during the ice age. Thus it\r\nseems that whatever disturbance this region has undergone could be\r\npartly attributed to ice-sheets without the presence of bowlder drift,\r\nbecause the temperature and texture of the ground in the limestone\r\nregion were unfavorable for such accumulations; yet it may be owing to\r\nthe action of ice that minerals once diffused are now found collected\r\nin fissures. The deep valleys through which the large rivers now pass\r\non their way toward the sea were once filled with glaciers which flowed\r\ninto them from their tributaries. Thus the deep trenches of the plains\r\nare largely the work of glaciers. It is generally supposed that the\r\ndriftless region of Wisconsin was free from ice during the frigid\r\nperiod. But it seems impossible for this region to have escaped being\r\ncovered by ice and snow, with the great lakes filled with glaciers, and\r\nthe regions on all sides of the driftless area covered with ice.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this territory escaped the drift from the north was on\r\naccount of the hindrance which the drift-bearing ice-sheet encountered\r\nin the deep basin of Lake Superior. In this great depression the\r\nice-sheet from the north was relieved of bowlders and other glacial\r\ndrift, as well as obstructed in its southern movement.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the snow and ice which gathered on the driftless region had\r\nlittle movement in any direction, while the temperature and consistency\r\nof the ground under the ice were not favorable for the production\r\nof bowlder drift; and, when we consider that the Mississippi valley\r\nwas deprived of great sources of warmth during the culmination of a\r\nglacial period, we are forced to the conclusion that its wide lands\r\nwere also covered with snow and ice.\r\n\r\nThe tropical waters of the North Atlantic were so much chilled by the\r\nfloating icebergs of North-eastern America, Greenland, Iceland, and\r\nNorthern Europe that the Caribbean Sea, its warmest reservoir, was\r\nreduced to a temperature so low that the easterly winds which blew over\r\nits waters were unable to prevent ice-sheets from gathering on Eastern\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\nTherefore, during such frigid times it appears that, with the waters of\r\nthe Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico reduced to a low temperature, it\r\nwas impossible for the great Mississippi valley to escape glaciation,\r\nwhile being surrounded by cold seas and glaciated lands which extended\r\neven into the tropical latitudes. The broad, level lands of British\r\nAmerica and Siberia during the ice age must have been thickly covered\r\nby the snow which fell on the deeply frozen plains, besides the large\r\namount of snow that the cold westerly winds must have drifted over\r\ntheir icy surface from lands of greater snow-fall on their western\r\nborders. This snow during such freezing times could not be melted away.\r\n\r\nThe great ice-sheets thus formed over wide, level lands could have\r\nbut little motion in any direction, certainly not sufficient to cause\r\nglacial drift of much magnitude; yet the ice-sheet, at one stage of\r\nits existence, probably served to widen and deepen the channels of the\r\ngreat rivers which empty into the Arctic Ocean from these vast regions,\r\nand the glacial débris from such erosion was deposited in the arctic\r\nseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THEORIES ADVANCED FOR EXPLAINING ICE PERIODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 12, 1891, Professor Geikie made his presidential address before\r\nthe Edinburgh Geological Society, the subject being “Supposed Causes of\r\nthe Glacial Period.”\r\n\r\nMany of his views advanced in this lecture were so much in accordance\r\nwith my own that I am induced to repeat them. He said that the glacial\r\nperiod was a general phenomenon due to some widely acting cause, and\r\nthat where we now have the greatest rain-fall the greatest snow-fall\r\ntook place, and that the Pleistocene period was characterized by great\r\noscillations of climate, extremely cold and very genial conditions\r\nalternating. He also said that in glacial and post-glacial times\r\nchanges in the relative level of the land and sea had taken place, and\r\nany suggested explanation which did not fully account for these various\r\nclimatic and geographical conditions could not be satisfactory. And,\r\nwhile examining the earth-movement hypothesis, he pointed out that in\r\nthe first place there was not the least evidence of great continental\r\nelevations and depressions in the northern hemisphere, such as the\r\nhypothesis postulated. Next he showed that, even if the diserrated\r\nearth-movements were admitted, they would not account for the phenomena.\r\n\r\nSuch changes, no doubt, would profoundly affect the maritime regions of\r\nNorth America and Europe; but they would not bring about the conditions\r\nthat obtained at the climax of the ice age.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the earth-movement hypothesis was this: it did not\r\naccount for interglacial conditions. The advocates of that hypothesis\r\nimagined that these conditions would supervene when the highly elevated\r\nnorthern regions were depressed to their present level. But these\r\nwere the conditions that obtained at the present time; and yet in\r\nspite of them the climate was neither so equable nor so genial as that\r\nwhich obtained in interglacial times and during the mild stage of the\r\nnecessary post-glacial period.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he said that the earth-movement hypothesis should be\r\nrejected, not only because it was highly improbable that such\r\nwonderfully rhythmic elevations and depressions of northern lands could\r\nhave taken place, but chiefly because it did not explain the conditions\r\nof the glacial periods and interglacial times.\r\n\r\nStill, Professor Geikie says that in glacial and in post-glacial times\r\nchanges in the relative level of the land and sea had taken place; and\r\nit is reasonable to suppose that such changes were obtained in the high\r\nlatitudes of both hemispheres during the breaking up of the last ice\r\nage.\r\n\r\nWe have previously pointed out that much of the ice of the glacial\r\nperiod in the southern hemisphere was melted away, and its waters\r\nwarmed sufficiently to assist the Gulf Stream and Japanese current to\r\nbring about a mild period in the northern hemisphere; for without such\r\nassistance they would be unable to disperse the vast ice-sheets of the\r\nnorthern latitudes.\r\n\r\nStill, the attraction of the southern ocean waters into the northern\r\nseas must have commenced as soon as the growing ice-sheets of the large\r\ncontinents and islands of the high northern latitudes surpassed the\r\ngrowth and weight of the glaciers on the smaller lands of the southern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nHence the attraction of the ocean waters northward overcomes the force\r\nof the prevailing winds from moving an undue portion of the ocean’s\r\nsurface waters southward. Consequently, the movement of water from the\r\nsouthern seas into the northern latitudes continued so long as the\r\nvast northern ice-sheets increased in weight greater than the glaciers\r\nof the southern hemisphere. Therefore, at the perfection of a frigid\r\nage straits and channels situated so far southward as the Magellan and\r\nCape Horn channels were much diminished in width and depth or entirely\r\ndeprived of their waters. Through this cause such reduced channels were\r\nreadily filled with glaciers in a region of great snow-fall. The depth\r\nof water on the submerged northern lands at the close of the glacial\r\nperiod is not known.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Dawson, in the township of Montague in Ontario\r\nthe skeleton of a whale was found in post-glacial deposits 440 feet\r\nabove tide-water, and marine shells are known to occur on Montreal\r\nmountain at an elevation of 520 feet above the ocean; and it is said\r\nthat there are traces of submergence of over one thousand feet in the\r\nhigher latitudes, including the islands of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAccording to the researches of Dr. J. W. Spencer, one great sheet of\r\nwater covered most of the great lake region about the close of the\r\nice age; and the lower strands of these inland seas are known to be\r\nconnected with old marine shore lines. The probable reason why so few\r\nsea-shells collected on the glacial drift during such times was because\r\nof so much marine life having been exterminated in the high northern\r\nlatitudes during the frigid age. Therefore, the sea, in the short\r\nperiod of northern submergence, left but few traces on the glacial\r\ndrift it once flowed.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that, if the ocean waters were attracted northward\r\nthrough the preponderance of northern ice-sheets, they not only\r\nassisted in melting the northern ice, but also served to greatly reduce\r\nthe waters in the Cape Horn channel, and so largely prevented the\r\nindependent circulation of the southern ocean, thus furthering a mild\r\nclimate in the southern hemisphere until the prevailing winds, after\r\nthe northern ice-sheets were melted, were able to move more of the\r\nocean waters southward than they could move northward, owing to the\r\nocean currents setting southward being less obstructed than the lesser\r\ncurrents setting northward. This tendency of the ocean waters to move\r\nsouthward I have before explained in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nBut I will say in addition that, on further consideration, it seems\r\nthat one of the main causes of the waters of the augmented northern\r\noceans moving southward so soon after the melting of the ice from\r\nthe northern lands was on account of so much water being attracted\r\nsouthward to the great low sea-level east of Cape Horn. This vast low\r\nsea-level remained a great area of attraction for the northern seas\r\nuntil so much northern water was moved into the southern ocean as to\r\nreduce the seas of the northern hemisphere and augment the southern\r\nocean sufficiently to enlarge the Cape Horn channel, thus causing\r\nthe extinction of the vast low sea-level that furnished such great\r\nattraction for the waters of the more northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nIf the earth-movement hypothesis, so wholly rejected by Professor\r\nGeikie, fails to explain the cause or causes of a northern ice age, it\r\nseems to be still more inadequate for explaining the occurrence of ice\r\nperiods extending over both hemispheres. For it is not probable that\r\nportions of continents and large islands rose above the snow-line in\r\nboth temperate zones during the same period of time, and then again\r\nobtained their present level with the occurrence of a mild era.\r\n\r\nThose who maintain that the continents of North America and Europe\r\nrose to great elevations during the ice age, in order to prove their\r\nassertions, point to the fiords which indent the eastern and western\r\ncoasts of North America, and also to the fiords of Norway, as having\r\nbeen eroded by streams of ice that flowed along the bottom of such\r\ngorges when they were above the sea.\r\n\r\nBut it appears that such erosion could be performed by heavy glaciers\r\nwith the lands at their present level. A glacier three thousand feet\r\nthick would fill and press heavily on the bottom of a gorge fifteen\r\nhundred feet in depth. Therefore, should the bottom of a fiord sink\r\nhundreds of feet below the sea-level, a glacier several thousand feet\r\nthick flowing through and over it into a sea of much greater depth, the\r\nerosion at the bottom of the sunken channel would be greater than on\r\nthe land above the sea, where the ice possessed less weight.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is not necessary that lands pierced by deep fiords\r\nshould have acquired a higher level during the ice age than they now\r\nmaintain. And it is probable that on the antarctic continent ice\r\nerosion may be going on at much greater depths below the sea-level than\r\nthe deepest channels in the high northern latitudes. For it is likely\r\nthat the temperature of a glacier is so low in such frigid regions\r\nthat it holds firmly in its freezing grasp such bowlders as may become\r\ndetached from the rocks, thus giving it great erosive power.\r\n\r\nBut this great eroding ability could not be maintained by glaciers in\r\nthe lower latitudes, where a higher temperature would largely deprive\r\nthe ice of its abrading properties except on the steep slopes of\r\nmountainous lands.\r\n\r\nThere are deposits of ice on the North American coast bordering the\r\narctic shores, and also on Northern Siberia, that are supposed to have\r\nexisted since the last frigid period, and are likely to be preserved\r\ninto a future cold age, which now appears to have made considerable\r\nprogress on Greenland and other ice-clad arctic shores on account of\r\nthe independent circulation of the Arctic Ocean waters, which largely\r\nexcludes the Gulf Stream from the polar seas; and it is for this reason\r\nthat the glaciers on the elevated lands of Iceland are being enlarged\r\nand rapidly advancing. Yet, notwithstanding the gathering of ice\r\nand increasing coldness of lands largely removed from the warm Gulf\r\ncurrents, there are still mountain regions where glaciers may have been\r\npreserved through post-glacial times, although directly to the leeward\r\nand under the influence of the Gulf Stream and Japanese currents.\r\nThese glaciers are situated in the Alpine districts of Europe and on\r\nthe mountain ranges of Alaska. It would appear that, were the climate\r\ngrowing gradually colder in the northern temperate zones, such glaciers\r\nshould be increasing in size.\r\n\r\nYet it is said that such is not always the case. This is probably\r\nowing to their being subject to the genial influence of the tropical\r\ncurrents. For, although the climate of Europe and Alaska may have been\r\nslowly growing colder for centuries, still the slow shrinkage of these\r\nonce immense glaciers may still be going on, although at a much slower\r\nrate than formerly, even if the tender plants of these latitudes,\r\nbecause of the growing coldness, have gradually moved southward.\r\n\r\nAs to the Alpine glaciers, M. Forel reports from data he has collected\r\nthat there have been several enlargements and diminutions during the\r\nlast century. And since 1875 enlargements have taken place, their\r\nshrinkage being caused by warm and dry weather, while their enlargement\r\nwas brought about during cold and rainy seasons. The glaciers of\r\nAlaska cannot attain much extension until the waters of the great\r\nJapanese stream acquire a lower temperature. There is at this date a\r\nsmall current setting down through the eastern side of Bering Strait,\r\nbearing field-ice in the spring season down to Anadyr Gulf. The Okhotsk\r\nSea in the spring season furnishes considerable field-ice to cool the\r\nnorth Pacific waters, and the wintry winds which sweep down from the\r\nhigh lands of Northern Asia also serve to chill the Pacific seas; but\r\nall such sources of cold combined at this age have but little general\r\neffect on the vast Japanese current, which still has warmth sufficient\r\nto prevent the increase of glaciers on Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis great ocean stream in its impact against the shores of Oregon\r\ncauses a high sea-level, which is mostly turned southward by the\r\nprevailing north-west winds. Still, a comparatively small stream\r\nsets along the shore of the Alaska Gulf, and also through the island\r\npassages toward a slight low sea-level, to the leeward of the Alaska\r\npeninsula; and it is probable that this current which warms these\r\nin-shore waters is favored by the difference of temperature and density\r\nbetween the waters abreast Oregon and the Gulf of Alaska, and it may be\r\nowing to the same cause that a small stream is sent along the eastern\r\nshore of Bering Strait into the deep portions of the Arctic Ocean. Thus\r\nbecause of the warm waters that proceed from the great Japanese current\r\nthe glaciers of Alaska are prevented from increasing their bulk.\r\n\r\nThe only way to furnish the Japanese stream with colder water, and\r\nso cause glaciers to increase on the north-west coast of America, is\r\nthrough the great Humboldt current, which has its rise in the southern\r\nocean west of Patagonia and the Cape Horn channel, where a moderate but\r\nvast high sea-level is formed on account of the great drift current of\r\nthe southern ocean being somewhat obstructed on its passage through the\r\nCape Horn channel, which is about one-third the breadth of the westerly\r\nwind-belt.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the northern portion of the waters of the high sea-level\r\nso caused are attracted northward to the low sea-level abreast Peru,\r\nfrom whence they are moved by the south-east trade winds as a drift\r\ncurrent to the equatorial latitudes, thus meeting and mingling with the\r\nreturning Japanese current abreast Central America, and so giving head\r\nto the great equatorial stream which moves westward over the Pacific\r\nOcean, partly impelled by the trade winds, and, on gaining the western\r\nside of the ocean, sends off from a moderate high sea-level a large\r\nstream to the low sea-level caused by the westerly winds abreast Japan,\r\nfrom whence it is drifted by the same winds over to the north-west\r\ncoast of America, thus forming the great Japanese current.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the temperature of the Humboldt current, being governed by\r\nthe temperature of the southern ocean from which it takes its rise, is\r\ncooling at a slow rate through the enlargement of ice-sheets in the\r\nantarctic regions, while the increase of glaciers on Patagonia will\r\nin time greatly add to its coolness, and so lower the temperature of\r\nthe equatorial current from which the Japanese current branches, the\r\nlatter current being made cooler through the increase of coldness of\r\nthe former streams. Therefore, the temperature of Alaska, which is\r\ngoverned by the Japanese current, will slowly acquire a colder climate;\r\nand, consequently, its glaciers will increase in size sufficient to\r\nlaunch icebergs into the Pacific to be currented southward, and so\r\nstill further lower the temperature of the Eastern Pacific waters,\r\nand consequently the equatorial current from which the Japanese stream\r\nbranches, and so eventually, under the above conditions, cause heavy\r\nice-sheets to spread widely over the north-west coast of North America.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above explanations how an increase of cold\r\nin the southern hemisphere is necessary to cause a wider spread of\r\nice-sheets on lands in the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nEspecially is this the case to promote the gathering of glaciers on the\r\nwest coast of North America. The great equatorial current while on its\r\nway to the Indian Ocean not only sends off the Japanese stream, but\r\nalso the East Australian current, which is like the Japanese current,\r\nhaving its temperature lowered in proportion as the equatorial stream\r\nis cooled. Therefore, the southern ocean is slowly being deprived of\r\nequatorial heat from this source.\r\n\r\nI have explained how the increasing coldness of the superior oceans of\r\nthe southern hemisphere affects more or less the temperature of the\r\nGulf Stream, which meanwhile is only able to enter a small portion\r\nof its waters into the Arctic Ocean after undergoing a long cooling\r\nprocess as a drift current; and, while thus mingling with the arctic\r\nwaters, it is not able to prevent the gathering of ice-sheets on\r\nGreenland, where glaciers are launching bergs to float southward as far\r\nas the latitude of 40° north. Consequently, the northern seas are now\r\nbeing cooled as well as the seas of the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nYet this cooling process is so slow there is a lack of data to\r\nshow that the temperature of the high latitudes is lowering. Our\r\nthermometrical observations are of such recent date they cannot be used\r\nto determine climatic changes which requires centuries to bring about.\r\nStill, it is generally known that the climate of Northern Europe has\r\nbeen accused of growing colder. The vine no longer flourishes on the\r\nshores of Bristol Channel or in Flanders or Brittany; and vineyards\r\nare no longer planted on the elevated shores of France where they\r\nflourished three hundred years ago. Arago did not refuse to believe\r\nthat the laws regulating the temperature of Western Europe had notably\r\naltered. This is proved, he said, by the general retrogradation of the\r\nvineyards southward.\r\n\r\nThe recent deadly freezing of the orange groves of Florida makes it\r\nuncertain whether the cultivation of the orange can again be successful\r\nin the counties where during this generation it has been very\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nTravellers visiting Iceland say that the old accounts of its prosperity\r\nseem strange to those who now visit its shores; and it is narrated in\r\nthe Sagas that in early times sheep could shift for themselves during\r\nwinter, and that there were large forests and that corn ripened.\r\nSeveral years ago a correspondent of the _Spectator_, writing from\r\nNorthern Russia where the Volga is locked with ice for six months in\r\nthe year, stated that “the people were beginning to show increased\r\nresentment at the climate, and that there was reason to believe that\r\nthe northern government of Russia would be abandoned to the desert. The\r\npeople silently glide south by the tens of thousands every year, so the\r\nlife of Russia was concentrating in the south.”\r\n\r\nIt is now the opinion of travellers in arctic lands that the\r\ninhabitants of the Esquimaux regions are decreasing, as are also the\r\ninhabitants of Northern Siberia.\r\n\r\nA writer in the North China _Herald_, of Shanghai, says that “the\r\nclimate of Asia is becoming colder than it formerly was, and its\r\ntropical animals and plants are retreating southward at a slow rate.\r\nIn the time of Confucius elephants were in use on the Yangtse River.\r\nA hundred and fifty years after this Mencius speaks of the tiger, the\r\nleopard, the rhinoceros, and the elephant as being in many parts of\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n“It is also said that the ferocious alligator, that formerly infested\r\nthe rivers of South China, has retreated southward.\r\n\r\n“The flora of the country is also affected by the increasing coldness\r\nof the climate. The bamboo is not found in the forests of North China,\r\nwhere it grew naturally two thousand years ago, but is still grown in\r\nPekin, with the aid of good shelter, as a sort of garden plant only.”\r\n\r\nA letter from Hong Kong, published in the London _Standard_, reports\r\nthat on the 15th of January, 1893, the temperature of Hong Kong, a\r\ntropical seaport of China, was below freezing for three days, and was\r\ncolder than ever before known. The rocks and also vegetation were\r\ncovered with a coating of ice. The thermometer at times stood at 23°\r\nand 26° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nI have previously explained how the slow increasing coldness of the\r\nnorthern temperate zone is also being carried out in the southern\r\nhemisphere. The meteorological records for the lofty table lands of\r\nEcuador, although very incomplete, furnish strong evidence to show that\r\nthe mean temperature of that region is gradually lowering.\r\n\r\nObservations made by Boussingault at Quito in 1831, compared with those\r\nfrom 1878 to 1881, showed a decrease from 15.2° Centigrade to 13.27°\r\nCentigrade.\r\n\r\nRecords made by Hall from 1825 to 1827 give averages of 16.1°\r\nCentigrade, 15.52° Centigrade, and 15.6° Centigrade. This decrease\r\nholds good for all points in the inter-Andean region where records have\r\nbeen kept.\r\n\r\nYet we know that the falling temperature in the northern temperate\r\nlatitudes is not brought about by a yearly increase of cold, because,\r\nwhen the arctic channels are somewhat obstructed with icebergs, the\r\nmovement of arctic waters through them is lessened; and, therefore,\r\nduring such times the Gulf Stream, meeting with less opposition from\r\narctic currents while flowing northward, is able to move a larger\r\nvolume of its waters into the arctic seas, thus warming their waters\r\nsufficiently in a few seasons to clear the obstructed channels, and\r\nalso somewhat soften for several successive years the temperature of\r\nsuch lands as border on the seas of that region.\r\n\r\nAnd in this way we account for the mild seasons which at times follow\r\nthose of lower temperature in high northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nBut, when the detained icebergs are set adrift, and currented into the\r\ntemperate North Atlantic, the heat consumed while melting such numerous\r\nbodies of ice is able to more than overcome the warmth gained during\r\nthe temporary detention of ice in the northern seas. Thus, under such\r\nconsiderations, it appears that the conditions are favorable for the\r\ngrowth of glaciers in the high northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out the manner in which the superior oceans in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere are obtaining a lower temperature, and how\r\nthey impart their coldness to the tropical currents, and in this\r\nway slowly cool the waters of all oceans. Thus it appears that the\r\nnorthern temperate zone, with all other parts of the earth, is slowly\r\napproaching a cold epoch.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers on climatic changes have expressed their views as to\r\nthe number of glacial and mild periods that have been perfected since\r\nthe conditions have been favorable for their appearance on the globe.\r\nAccording to my views, while considering the reasons for the occurrence\r\nof the great glacial periods which have left such extensive traces on\r\nthe land, it seems certain that two very cold epochs have possessed\r\nthe earth, separated by a warm period; and, possibly, other preceding\r\ncold epochs of less intensity have possessed the high latitudes, with\r\nintervening periods of mildness. But the earlier cold periods, if they\r\never existed, were comparatively short, because the Cape Horn channel\r\nduring such times possessed less capacity than in the later periods,\r\nand, therefore, was more easily and quickly obstructed by the natural\r\nmethods previously explained.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the independent circulation of the southern ocean was\r\nsooner arrested than during the later epoch, when the channel had\r\nbecome enlarged by erosion from heavy glaciers and icebergs; and\r\nmeanwhile the same conditions may have governed the arctic channels\r\nwhich give an independent circulation to the arctic waters which\r\nsurround Greenland, and thus, in connection with cold epochs in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, have caused periods of cold of small intensity to\r\noccur in the high northern latitudes, and it may happen in the future\r\nthat more ice periods will be perfected than the one now progressing.\r\n\r\nStill, it is well to bear in mind that the Cape Horn channel, which\r\nis the real cause of glacial periods having occurred in both the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres, in the manner previously explained,\r\nis being made wider and deeper during each succeeding ice age. For\r\nthis reason the latest cold epoch will require a longer continuance\r\nof cold to obstruct the channel than the cold period preceding.\r\nTherefore, it appears that the time will come when there will be such\r\ngreat accumulations of ice stored on the land and in the sea before\r\nthe enlarged Cape Horn channel can be closed that, when it is closed,\r\nthere will not be sufficient warmth remaining in the tropical seas to\r\nunite with the sun’s rays to subdue the intense cold stored in the\r\nimmense gatherings of ice. And thus the earth, which began its career\r\nwith a warm temperature, and so continued for long ages, will finally\r\nterminate in an endless glacial age.\r\n\r\nThe statements made by General Cowell in _Science_ of Nov. 25, 1892, in\r\nreference to the alleged discovery of the second rotation of the earth\r\nby Major-general Drayson, represents the discovery as affording a new\r\nsolution for the cause or causes of an ice age.\r\n\r\nThe second rotation as defined consists in the pole of the heavens\r\ndescribing a circle around a point which is ascertained to be\r\nsituated six degrees distant from the pole of the ecliptic. And it\r\nis asserted that by a knowledge of the second rotation it is proved\r\nthat a variation of twelve degrees in the extent of the arctic circle\r\nand the tropics occurred not later than 13,500 B.C., “the tropics\r\nvarying in distance from the equator from the minimum of 23° 25′\r\n47″ to the maximum of 35° 25′ 47″, thus extending the torrid zone\r\nduring its widest expansion from Cape Hatteras to the river Plate....\r\nIt is calculated that at this date we are about 403 years distant\r\nfrom the time when the pole of the heavens in its revolution, the\r\npole of the ecliptic and that of the second rotation, will be in\r\nthe same colure,--that is, in the year 2,295 A.D.; and then the\r\nleast differences in temperature between summer and winter will be\r\nexperienced. From that time forward this difference will increase, and\r\nabout 6,000 years later, or about the year 8,300 A.D., the earth will\r\nenter the next glacial period, and attain its greatest severity about\r\nthe year 18,136 of our era.” General Cowell does not state how the\r\nwidening of the tropical zone, as above set forth, would bring about\r\na glacial period. The winters of the temperate zones would evidently\r\nbe colder than now; but, on the other hand, the summers would be\r\nproportionally warmer, while the westerly winds above the latitudes of\r\n40° would prevail the same as now.\r\n\r\nTherefore, their general effect on the surface waters of the ocean\r\nin the high latitudes would not be changed with such an extension of\r\nthe tropical zone, neither would the trade winds change their general\r\ndirection with a wider torrid zone; yet the boundaries of the trade\r\nwinds and also the westerly winds would be more shifting according to\r\nthe declination of the sun, such winds being governed as now by the\r\nposition of the sun during the summer and winter solstice. Yet the\r\nnatural process for moving tropical water into the high latitudes, or\r\nexcluding it therefrom, would not be greatly changed.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the expansion of the torrid zone to the latitudes named\r\nby General Drayson would not affect the climate of the hemispheres\r\nsufficiently to cause a frigid epoch. On the contrary, the summer\r\nmonsoons, which now blow from the north-east, along the shores of\r\nEastern Africa, and also along the coast of Southern Brazil, would be\r\nmuch stronger with a vertical sun in midsummer as far south as river\r\nPlate, thus forcing the surface waters of the tropical oceans into the\r\nhigher latitudes with greater facility than at this age.\r\n\r\nMoreover, according to the statements of General Cowell, the present\r\nperiod of mildness should be on the increase, and obtain perfection\r\nin the year 2,295, or about 400 years hence; while, on the contrary,\r\naccording to the explanations we have given in the preceding pages,\r\nthere is much to show that an ice age is advancing, and has made\r\nconsiderable progress in the high latitudes of both hemispheres.\r\nFurthermore, if the second rotation, as claimed by General Cowell,\r\nis able to perfect a glacial period at regular intervals of 31,600\r\nyears, it seems that traces of frigid epochs should not be confined to\r\nlate geological records, as there appear to be little or no traces of\r\nglacial work prior to the Quaternary or Post-tertiary periods.\r\n\r\nIt appears that explanations so far given, which depend on the\r\nastronomical theory to account for the ice age, are not in harmony with\r\nwell-known geographical facts. The explainers neglect the attention due\r\nto the great prevailing winds which since the earlier geological ages\r\nhave, in connection with continents, moved the surface waters of the\r\nocean from torrid latitudes to colder zones, and from the colder zones\r\nto the warmer latitudes.\r\n\r\nThis exchange of ocean waters between the zones is as old as the\r\ncontinents which shape their courses. The important change wrought in\r\nthe ocean currents sufficient to have caused the glacial age which\r\nended the early warm epochs was brought about through the action of the\r\nprevailing winds, which, in connection with the form of continents,\r\nbecame able to move the ocean waters from the northern hemisphere into\r\nthe southern sufficient to submerge the low lands of the southern\r\nhemisphere, causing a great diversion of the tropical currents from\r\nthe high southern latitudes, such as I have pointed out in preceding\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nThose writers who believe that ocean currents have been the cause of\r\ngreat climatic changes have suggested that the existence of an ancient\r\nchannel through the isthmus of Panama would have caused a frigid period\r\non lands bordering on the northern shores of the Atlantic by turning\r\nthe head-waters of the Gulf Stream into the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz thinks that such a channel existed during some remote\r\ngeological age, judging from the semblance of the fauna pertaining to\r\nthe Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nYet it may be said that an open channel through Central America would\r\nhave connected two high sea-levels.\r\n\r\nFor this reason there would be little or no exchange of water between\r\nthe Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe high sea-level on the Pacific side is caused by the prevailing\r\nnorth-west winds which blow down the North American coast past\r\nCalifornia as far south as Central America; while, on the other hand,\r\nthe south-east trade winds impel the surface waters of the South\r\nPacific along the coast of Peru down to the equator, and so onward 5°\r\nto 8° north latitude. Thus the space between the ending of the two\r\nocean winds obtains a high sea-level, corresponding to the high level\r\nof the Caribbean Sea. This has been proved from levellings for the\r\nNicaragua ship canal.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Atlantic waters would not run into the Pacific Ocean,\r\neven if a channel opened through Central America.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Gulf Stream has never been turned away from the North\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nWriters, while seeking a cause for the mild climate of ages preceding\r\nthe glacial epochs, have thought that during such times channels\r\nopening through Asia from the Indian Ocean by the way of the Persian\r\nGulf into the arctic seas would be the means of furnishing the Arctic\r\nOcean with warm water. But it is evident that such a movement of water\r\ncould not be brought about, because the winds would not be favorable\r\nfor it. For, when we reflect that the prevailing winds would blow in\r\nthe same direction as now, and that the seas of Eastern Europe and\r\nWestern Asia were enlarged during the warm epochs, it seems that they\r\nwould obtain high levels superior to the high level seas of the Indian\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nBesides, we should consider that there is a continuous range of high\r\nland separating the Persian Gulf from the northern seas, which probably\r\nexisted anterior to the ice age. Still, during later periods, while\r\nthe ice-sheets were being melted from the northern hemisphere and also\r\non the ending of the last ice age, the Isthmus of Suez was submerged,\r\nas were all other low lands in that latitude; but it is probable that\r\nthe waters of the high sea-level of the Indian Ocean abreast tropical\r\nAfrica did not flow largely into the Mediterranean Sea for the reason\r\nthat the enlarged European seas, being within the westerly wind-belt,\r\nmaintained a high sea-level, while at the same time the high level\r\ntropical Indian Ocean waters were strongly attracted into the southern\r\noceans through the Mozambique and Agulhas currents in the manner I\r\nhave previously explained. Yet the waters of the high sea-level of the\r\nsouthern European seas must have been strongly attracted to the low\r\nsea-level abreast the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nWhile considering the causes which brought about the glacial periods,\r\nit is well to reflect that the natural mode of action which could have\r\nproduced a frigid age was as extensive as the surface of the globe;\r\nand, therefore, any geographical change that would affect only a\r\ncomparatively small portion of the earth cannot serve to account for\r\nages of warmth which extended over the globe, or for glacial epochs\r\nwhich were separated by warm periods of time, which seem to have\r\naffected all lands and seas.\r\n\r\nAnd it appears from the geographical explanations given in preceding\r\npages of the general movements of the winds and currents of the sea how\r\nimpossible it is for heat to be conveyed to the antarctic latitudes\r\nsufficient to prevent the growth of glaciers on their lands while the\r\nCape Horn channel is in possession of its present capacity.\r\n\r\nFor, as has been shown, this channel furnishes opportunity for the\r\nwesterly winds to impel the surface waters of the great southern ocean\r\nconstantly around the globe, and so largely turns away the tropical\r\ncurrents from the high southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nConsequently, there seems to be no method yet devised through nature’s\r\nmode of action that can carry sufficient heat into the antarctic\r\nlatitudes to melt the ice-sheets from the southern continent, or even\r\narrest their growth, while the Cape Horn channel maintains its present\r\nwidth and depth.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the increase of glaciers and icebergs will slowly continue\r\nuntil a glacial epoch is perfected.\r\n\r\nAnd it seems that this arrangement for bringing about a frigid age\r\nmade slower progress in its early stage than at this date, owing to\r\nthere having been a lack of glacial ice in the polar regions to produce\r\nicebergs for cooling the ocean waters. But the independent circulation\r\nof the great southern ocean, after turning away the tropical currents\r\nfrom the high southern latitudes for thousands of years, did at length\r\ncause glaciers to form on the antarctic lands, which have been slowly,\r\nbut constantly increasing; and, consequently, the cooling of the ocean\r\nhas been accelerated proportionate to the increase of ice-sheets.\r\nTherefore, with the cooling process so well advanced as it now appears\r\nto be, it seems that more than half of the time required to bring a\r\nfrigid age to perfection has been expended since ice-sheets began to\r\ngather on the antarctic shores. For, when we realise how the facilities\r\nfor making ice have advanced through the increase of glaciers in both\r\nhemispheres, and how large a portion of the ocean waters have been\r\ncooled below a temperate or tropical temperature even in the torrid\r\nlatitudes where the warm upper waters of the ocean have been reduced\r\nto a comparatively thin stratum when compared to the vast bulk of the\r\ncooled under-waters, it appears that the cold will increase at a faster\r\nrate for the next thousand years than was the case during the last ten\r\ncenturies. Therefore, the climate will be less favorable for plants and\r\nanimals existing on lands in the high latitudes for the next thousand\r\nyears than during the ten centuries preceding; and, when we take into\r\nconsideration the accelerative growth of a frigid epoch, it seems that\r\nthe increasing cold will in a few thousand years drive the greater\r\nportion of both plants and animals from the now temperate latitudes to\r\nmaintain an existence in the tropical zone, where a large part of the\r\nexisting species of such life must have taken refuge during the last\r\nice period.\r\n\r\nAnd, from what can be learned from the relics of man’s prehistoric\r\nlife, it seems to point to the lands of the tropical latitudes as\r\nhaving been his home during the frigid ages; and, because of his long\r\nundisturbed residence in favored portions of the tropics, he there\r\nattained his earliest civilization. For it appears that the tropical\r\nzone was not only less burdened with ice in glacial times than the\r\nhigher latitudes of the globe, but was also more exempt from the\r\ngreat flooding of lands which obtained in the more northern latitudes\r\nthrough the shifting of the ocean waters, from causes set forth in the\r\npreceding pages. Yet it may be said that the low lands of the tropical\r\nzone south of the equator during cold epochs were much more extensive\r\nthan at this age, on account of the shrinkage of the sea, because of\r\nthe great amount of water evaporated from its surface, and stored in\r\nice-sheets on the great continents and islands. Hence the reefs and\r\nshallows which surround such tropical islands as include the Seychelles\r\nArchipelago, and also the extensive banks covered with shoal water\r\nin that portion of the Indian Ocean, were during the glacial period\r\nelevated above the surface of the sea, possessing a climate favorable\r\nfor vegetable and animal life. But, owing to the great rain-fall of\r\nthat region, it is probable that the highest lands were glaciated,\r\nas it is reported that granite bowlders still rest on the mountain\r\nslopes of the highest island. The numerous islands and shoals of the\r\nsouth-western tropical Pacific must also have afforded wide land areas,\r\nwith a temperate climate, owing to their having been situated on one of\r\nthe warmest regions of the earth during the ice age.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is probable that these tropical lands afforded space for\r\nnumerous lagoons which had little connection with the surrounding\r\noceans, and consequently were able to maintain, in their secluded\r\nshallow basins, a warmer temperature than obtained in the open seas;\r\nand at the same time, owing to the great rainfall in such tropical\r\nportions of the Indian and Pacific regions, the waters of the lagoons\r\nwere rendered less salt than the briny depths of the shrunken oceans\r\nof a cold period. Hence because of such conditions the fauna of the\r\ntropical seas were preserved from the destructive rigor which beset the\r\nearth during the frigid epochs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in the original book; otherwise they\r\nwere not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced quotation\r\nmarks were remedied when the change was obvious, and otherwise left\r\nunbalanced.",
