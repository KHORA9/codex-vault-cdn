Have\r\nyou forgotten?  You went with your little round head close clipped till\r\nall the scar places showed white and you came back with a mat of\r\nsunbleached hair, your face and hands and legs brown as a nut.\r\n\r\nProbably you treasure recollections of those boyhood days when a raw\r\nfield turnip, peeled with a \"toad-stabber,\" was mighty good eatin'.\r\nYou remember the cows and chickens, the horses, pigs and sheep, the old\r\ncorn-crib where generally you could scare up a chipmunk, the gnarled\r\nold orchard--the Eastern rail-fenced farm of a hundred-acres-or-so.\r\nYou remember Wilson's Emporium at the Corners where you went for the\r\nmail--the place where the overalled legs of the whole community drummed\r\nidly against the cracker boxes and where dried prunes, acquired with\r\ndue caution, furnished the juvenile substitute for a chew of tobacco!\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you did not know even this much about country life--you of\r\nthe Big Cities.  To you, it may be, the Farmer has been little more\r\nthan the caricatures of the theatres.  You have seen him wearing blue\r\njeans or a long linen duster in \"The Old Homestead,\" wiping his eyes\r\nwith a big red bandana from his hip pocket.  You have seen him dance\r\neccentric steps in wrinkled cowhide boots, his hands beneath flapping\r\ncoat-tails, his chewing jaws constantly moving \"the little bunch of\r\nspinach on his chin!\"  You have heard him fiddle away like two-sixty at\r\n\"Pop Goes the Weasel!\"  You have grinned while he sang through his nose\r\nabout the great big hat with the great big brim, \"All Ba-ound Ra-ound\r\nWith a Woolen String!\"\r\n\r\nYes, and you used to read about the Farmer, too--Will Carleton's farm\r\nballads and legends; Riley's fine verses about the frost on the pumpkin\r\nand \"Little Orphant Annie\" and \"Over the Hill to the Poorhouse!\"  And\r\nwhen Cousin Letty took you to the Harvest Home Supper and Grand\r\nEntertainment in the Town Hall you may have heard the village choir\r\nwail: \"Oh, _Shall_ We Mortgage the Farm?\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps even yet, now that you are man grown--business or professional\r\nman of the great cities--perhaps even yet, although you long have\r\nstudied the market reports and faithfully have read the papers every\r\nday--perhaps that first impression of what a farmer was like still\r\nlingers in a more or less modified way.  So that to you pretty much of\r\nan \"Old Hayseed\" he remains.  Thus, while you have been busy with other\r\nthings, the New Farmer has come striding along until he has \"arrived in\r\nour midst\" and to you he is a stranger.\r\n\r\nRemember the old shiny black mohair sofa and the wheezy, yellow-keyed\r\nmelodeon or the little roller hand-organ that used to play \"Old\r\nHundred\"?  They have given place to new styles of furniture, upright\r\npianos and cabinet gramophones.  Coffin-handles and wax flowers are not\r\nframed in walnut and hung in the Farmer's front parlor any more; you\r\nwill find the grotesque crayon portrait superseded by photo\r\nenlargements and the up-to-date kodak.  The automobile has widened the\r\ncircle of the Farmer's neighbors and friends, while the telephone has\r\nwiped distance from the map.\r\n\r\nIn the modern farm kitchen hot and cold water gushes from bright nickel\r\ntaps into a clean white enamel sink, thanks to the pneumatic water\r\nsupply system.  The house and other farm buildings are lighted by\r\nelectricity and perhaps the little farm power plant manages to operate\r\nsome machinery--to drive the washing machine, the cream separator, the\r\nchurn and the fodder-cutter or tanning-mill.  There is also a little\r\nblacksmith shop and a carpenter shop where repairs can be attended to\r\nwithout delay.  True, all these desirable conveniences may not be\r\npossessed generally as yet; but the Farmer has seen them working on the\r\nmodel farmstead exhibited by the Government at the Big Fair or in the\r\nFarm Mechanics car of the Better Farming Special Trains that have\r\ntoured the country, and he dreams about them.\r\n\r\nMore scientific methods of agriculture have been adopted.  The Farmer\r\nhas learned what may be accomplished by crop rotations and new methods\r\nof cultivation.  He has learned to analyze the soil and grow upon his\r\nland those crops for which it is best suited.  If he keeps a dairy herd\r\nhe tests each cow and knows exactly how her yield is progressing so\r\nthat it is impossible for her to \"beat her board bill.\"  No longer is\r\nit even considered good form to chop the head off the old rooster; the\r\nFarmer sticks him scientifically, painlessly, instantaneously dressing\r\nhim for market in the manner that commands the highest price.  So with\r\nthe butter, the eggs and all the rest of the farm products.\r\n\r\nDo you wonder that the great evolution of farming methods should lead\r\nto advanced thought upon the issues of the day?  In the living room the\r\nFamily Bible remains in its old place of honor, perhaps with the\r\ncrocheted mat still doing duty; but it is not now almost the only book\r\nin the house.  There is likely to be a sectional bookcase, filled with\r\nsolid volumes on all manner of practical and economic subjects--these\r\nas well as the best literature, the latest magazines and two or three\r\ncurrent newspapers.\r\n\r\nYes, a whole flock of tin roosters have rusted away on top of the barn\r\nsince the Farmer first began to consider himself the Rag Doll of\r\nCommerce and to seek adjustments.  It is the privilege of rag dolls to\r\nsurvive a lot of abuse; long after wax has melted and sawdust run the\r\nfaithful things are still on hand.  And along about crop time the\r\nFarmer finds himself attracting a little attention.\r\n\r\nThat is because this business of backbone farming is the backbone of\r\nBusiness In General.  As long as money is circulating freely Business\r\nIn General, being merely an exchange in values, wears a clean shirt and\r\nthe latest cravat.  But let some foreign substance clog the trade\r\nchannels and at once everything tightens up and squeezes everybody.\r\n\r\nDay by day the great mass of the toilers in the cities go to work\r\nwithout attempting to understand the fluctuations of supply and demand.\r\nThey are but cogs on the rim, dependent for their little revolutions\r\nupon the power which drives the machinery.  That power being Money\r\nValue, any wastage must be replaced by the creation of new wealth.  So\r\nmen turn to the soil for salvation--to the greatest manufacturing\r\nconcern in the world, Nature Unlimited.  This is the plant of which the\r\nFarmer is General Manager.\r\n\r\nOn state occasions, therefore, it has been the custom in the past to\r\ncall him \"the backbone of his country\"--its \"bone and sinew.\"  Without\r\nhim, as it were, the Commercial Fabric could not sit up in its High\r\nChair and eat its bread and milk.  Such fine speeches have been\r\napplauded loudly in the cities, too frequently without due\r\nthought--without it occurring to anyone, apparently, that perhaps the\r\nFarmer might prefer to be looked upon rather as an ordinary\r\nhard-working human being, entitled as such to \"a square deal.\"\r\n\r\nBut all these years times have been changing.  Gradually Agriculture\r\nhas been assuming its proper place in the scheme of things.  It is\r\nrecognized now that successful farming is a business--a profession, if\r\nyou like--requiring lifelong study, foresight, common sense, close\r\napplication; that it carries with it all the satisfaction of honest\r\nwork well done, all the dignity of practical learning, all the comforts\r\nof modern invention, all the wider benefits of clean living and right\r\nthinking in God's sunny places.\r\n\r\nAnd with his increasing self-respect the New Farmer is learning to\r\ncommand his rights, not merely to ask and accept what crumbs may fall.\r\nHe is learning that these are the days of Organization, of Co-Operation\r\namong units for the benefit of the Whole; that by pooling his resources\r\nhe is able to reach the Common Objective with the least waste of effort.\r\n\r\nHe has become a power in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese pages record a story of the Western Canadian farmer's upward\r\nstruggle with market conditions--a story of the organized Grain\r\nGrowers.  No attempt is made to set forth the full details of the whole\r\nFarmer's Movement in Western Canada in all its ramifications; for the\r\nspace limits of a single volume do not permit a task so ambitious.\r\n\r\nThe writer has endeavored merely to gather an authentic record of the\r\nearlier activities of the Grain Growers' Associations in the three\r\nPrairie Provinces--why and how they came to be organized, with what the\r\nfarmers had to contend and something of their remarkable achievements\r\nin co-operative marketing during the past decade.  It is a tale of\r\nstrife, limned by high lights and some shadows.  It is a record worthy\r\nof preservation and one which otherwise would pass in some of its\r\ndetails with the fading memories of the pathfinders.\r\n\r\nIf from these pages the reader is able to glean something of interest,\r\nsomething to broaden--be it ever so slightly--his understanding of the\r\nWestern Canadian farmers' past viewpoint and present outlook, the\r\nundertaking will have found its justification and the long journeys and\r\nmany interviews their reward.\r\n\r\nFor, under the alchemy of the Great War, many things are changing and\r\nin the wonderful days of reconstruction that lie ahead the Farmer is\r\ndestined to play an upstanding part in the new greatness of our\r\ncountry.  Because of this it behooves the humblest citizen of us to\r\nseek better understanding, to meet half way the hand of fellowship\r\nwhich he extends for a new conception of national life.\r\n\r\nThe writer is grateful to those farmers, grain men, government\r\nofficials and others who have assisted him so kindly in gathering and\r\nverifying his material.  Indebtedness is acknowledged also to sundry\r\nDominion Government records, to the researches of Herbert N. Casson and\r\nto the press and various Provincial Departments of Agriculture for the\r\nuse of their files.\r\n\r\nH.M.\r\n\r\nWINNIPEG, March 1st, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP FURROWS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE MAN ON THE QU'APPELLE TRAIL\r\n\r\n  Among the lonely lakes I go no more,\r\n    For she who made their beauty is not there;\r\n  The paleface rears his tepee on the shore\r\n    And says the vale is fairest of the fair.\r\n  Full many years have vanished since, but still\r\n    The voyageurs beside the camp-fire tell\r\n  How, when the moon-rise tips the distant hill,\r\n    They hear strange voices through the silence swell.\r\n          --_E. Pauline Johnson._\r\n            _The Legend of Qu'Appelle._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the rimming skyline, and beyond, the wheatlands of Assiniboia[1]\r\nspread endlessly in the sunshine.  It was early October in the year\r\n1901--one of those clear bright days which contribute enchantment to\r\nthat season of spun gold when harvest bounties are garnered on the\r\nCanadian prairies.  Everywhere was the gleam of new yellow stubble.  In\r\nserried ranks the wheat stocks stretched, dwindling to mere specks,\r\nmerging as they lost identity in distance.  Here and there stripes of\r\nplowed land elongated, the rich black freshly turned earth in sharp\r\ncontrast to the prevailing gold, while in a tremendous deep blue arch\r\noverhead an unclouded sky swept to cup the circumference of vision.\r\nMany miles away, yet amazingly distinct in the rarefied air, the smoke\r\nof threshers hung in funnelled smudges above the horizon--like the\r\nblack smoke of steamers, hull down, at sea.\r\n\r\nOn this particular autumn afternoon a certain black dot might have been\r\nobserved, so lost in the immensity of landscape that it appeared to be\r\nstationary.  It was well out upon the trail that wound northward from\r\nIndian Head into the country of the Fishing Lakes--the trail that\r\nforked also eastward to dip through the valley of the Qu'Appelle at\r\nBlackwood before striking north and east across the Kenlis plain\r\ntowards the Pheasant Hills.  In reality the well kept team which drew\r\nthe big grain wagon was swinging steadily ahead at a smart pace; for\r\ntheir load of supplies, the heaviest item of which was a new plow, was\r\ncomparatively light, they were homeward bound and the going in the\r\nearlier stages of the long journey was smooth.\r\n\r\nThe driver sat hunched in his seat, reins sagging.  He was a man of\r\npowerful physique, his skin deep coppered by long exposure to prairie\r\nwinds and sun.  In repose the face that was shadowed by the wide felt\r\nhat would have appeared somewhat deceptive in its placidity owing to\r\nthe fact that the strong jaw and firm mouth were partly hidden by a\r\nheavy moustache and a thick, black beard, trimmed short.\r\n\r\nJust now it was evident that the big farmer's mood was far from\r\npleasant.  Forearm on knee, he had surrendered completely to his\r\nthoughts.  His fists clenched spasmodically and there was an angry\r\nglint in his eyes.  Occasionally he shook his head as if the matter in\r\nmind were almost too hopeless for consideration.  A sudden surge of\r\nresentment made him lash his booted leg with the ends of the lines.\r\n\r\n\"Confound them!\" he muttered aloud.\r\n\r\nHe had just delivered his first load of the season's new wheat.  Three\r\nnights before, by lantern light, he had backed his horses to the wagon\r\nand hauled it twenty-five miles to the railway at Indian Head.  His\r\nstay there had not been conducive to peace of mind.\r\n\r\nTo reach the rails with a heavy load in favorable weather was simple\r\nenough; it merely required time.  But many such trips would be\r\nnecessary before his crop was marketed.  Some of the farmers from\r\nbeyond the Qu'Appelle would be hauling all winter; it was in winter\r\nthat the haul was long and cruel.  Starting at one, two or three\r\no'clock in the morning, it would be impossible to forecast the weather\r\nwith any degree of accuracy, so that often they would be overtaken by\r\nblizzards.  At such times the lack of stopping-places and shelter in\r\nthe sparsely settled reaches of the trail encompassed the journey with\r\nrisks every whit as real as pioneer perils of marauding Indians or\r\ntrailing wolf-packs.\r\n\r\nSnow and wind, however, had no place in the thoughts of the lonely\r\nfarmer at the moment.  Such things he had been used to ever since he\r\nfirst homesteaded; this long haul with the products of his toil he had\r\nbeen making for many years.  What immediately concerned him was the\r\ndiscouraging prospect of another wheat blockade instead of any\r\nimprovement in conditions which had become unbearable.  With the\r\ncountry as full of wheat as it was this year it required no great gift\r\nof prophecy to foretell what would happen.\r\n\r\nIt was happening already.  The railway people were ignoring completely\r\nthe car-distribution clauses of the Grain Act and thereby playing in\r\nwith the elevator interests, so that the farmers were going to be just\r\nwhere they were before--at the mercy of the buyers, their legitimate\r\nprofits filched by excessive dockage, low grades, depressed prices,\r\nexorbitant storage charges, even short weights in some cases.  All this\r\nin spite of the strong agitation which had led to Government action, in\r\nspite of the Royal Commission which had investigated the farmers'\r\nclaims and had recommended the Grain Act, in spite of the legislation\r\non the statutes!  Law or no law, the farmer was still to be preyed\r\nupon, apparently, without a single weapon left with which----\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the man in the broad-brimmed hat grew grave.  Scoff as he\r\nmight among the men of the district when the serious ones voiced their\r\nfears to him, his own thoughts always came back to those fears.  From\r\nthe Red River Valley to the foothills long-smouldering indignation was\r\nglowing like a streak of fire in the prairie grass; a spark or two more\r\nand nothing could stop the conflagration that would sweep the plains\r\ncountry.  If the law were to fail these red-blooded and long-suffering\r\nhomesteaders there would be final weapons alright--real weapons!  It\r\nwas no use shutting one's eyes to the danger.  Some fool would do\r\nsomething rash, and with the farmers already inflamed and embittered,\r\nthere was no telling what desperate things might be attempted.\r\n\r\nThat was the fear which stirred and perplexed the solitary traveller;\r\nfor he had heard things that afternoon--seen things that he did not\r\nlike but could not ignore.  He recognized an undercurrent of feeling, a\r\nsilence more ominous than all the heated talk, and that was where the\r\ndanger lay.  Something would have to be done, and that soon.  But what?\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was he that beyond an occasional flip of the reins or a\r\nword to the horses he paid no heed to his surroundings.  A huge\r\njack-rabbit sprang up, almost from beneath the noses of the team, and\r\nwent flying off in great leaps over the stubble.  A covey of prairie\r\nchicken, fat and fit, whirred into the air and rocketed away.  But he\r\nscarcely saw them.  Had he looked up he might have noticed a horseman\r\nloping down a cross trail with the evident intention of heading off the\r\nwagon.  But the rider had pounded almost within hailing distance before\r\nthe other was aware of his approach.\r\n\r\nIt was Bob McNair of the \"Two-Bar Ranch,\" as he insisted upon calling\r\nhis wheat farm.  He waved an oil-spattered Stetson and came into the\r\ntrail with a rush, pulling up the wiry broncho with a suddenness that\r\nwould have unseated one less accustomed than McNair, former corporal,\r\nRoyal North-West Mounted Police.\r\n\r\n\"Howdy, W. R.  Thought 'twas your outfit.  Good job I aint a Blackfoot\r\non the warpath,\" he laughed.  \"I'd sure 'a' had your scalp sneaked\r\nbefore you could draw a bead!\"  He swung alongside, stepped into the\r\nwagon, looped the bridle-rein over the handle of the new plow and,\r\nclimbing forward, shook hands heartily and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"You're looking fit, Bob,\" welcomed the other with evident pleasure.\r\n\"What brings you over this way?  Everything going alright?\"\r\n\r\n\"So-so,\" nodded McNair.  \"Been over Sintaluta to see about gettin' a\r\ncar, among other things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you got it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure!  Oh, sure I got it--got it still to get!\" and McNair burst into\r\na flow of language that did even him justice.  More or less vehement at\r\nall times, the one-time corporal exhibited so much vigor in his remarks\r\nthat his good-natured auditor had to laugh.  \"I ain't tryin' to be\r\nfunny!\" finished McNair.  \"I mean every dashed word of it, Motherwell.\r\nIf I don't get some of it out o' my system I'll bust to bits, that's\r\nwhat.  Say, I met Sibbold.  He told me some of you fellows was meetin'\r\nover at the Head to-day.  What about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, Johnny Millar got a few of us together to talk things over.\r\nLot of talk alright.  Some of the boys were feeling pretty hot, I can\r\ntell you!  But I can't see that anything came of it except some\r\nresolutions--the usual sort, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!  I was hopin' it meant action of some kind.\"  The ex-rancher\r\nwas silent for a moment.  Then his right fist went into his left palm\r\nwith a smack.  \"The only kind o' resolution that'll get anythin' is\r\nmade o' lead and fits in a rifle breech!  And I want to tell you, old\r\nman, if there ain't some pretty quick right-about-facin' in certain\r\nquarters, I'll be dashed if I ain't for it!  An' I won't be standin'\r\nalone, either!\" he added grimly.\r\n\r\nW. R. Motherwell[2] glanced sharply at the tense face.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk nonsense!\" he reproved quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't talkin' nonsense.  Not on your life!  If I am, then I reckon I\r\nknow a hundred or so hard-headed farmers who're doin' the identical\r\nsame.  An' if I know that many in my territory, W. R., how many d'you\r\nsuppose there are if we take in Manitoba and clean through to the\r\nmountains?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then all I've got to say is: there are more and bigger fools in the\r\ncountry than I had any idea of.\"\r\n\r\n\"What d'you mean, talkin' like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I've got to say to you, McNair,\" retorted the big\r\nfarmer with heat.  \"What do _you_ mean, talking like that?  If you're\r\nserious in what you say----\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I was, didn't I?\" snapped the other.\r\n\r\n\"Then you ought to be tied up on the Two-Bar and muzzled, for you're\r\nplumb mad, McNair!  It's just that kind of firebrand talk that's\r\nhurting our cause.  The farmers have got enough enemies now, God knows,\r\nwithout making a lot of new ones.  Doggone your hide, Mac, what're you\r\ntrying to do?--Stir up another rebellion like that of '85?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it's necessary--you bet I am!\" he brazened.\r\n\r\n\"You, of all men!\"\r\n\r\n\"An' why not me?  Just because I've worn the Queen's uniform, eh?\r\nWell, let me tell you, sir, I belonged to a body of men who stood for\r\nBritish justice an' a square deal to even the meanest Injun in the\r\nTerritories.\"  The ex-mounted policeman spoke with pride.  \"We'd never\r\nhave handled the beggars if it hadn't been for that.  Even the Injuns\r\nwere men enough to recognize justice, an' that's more'n these\r\ncommercial blood-suckers to-day can do!  If our case was in the hands\r\nof the Force it'd rest on its merits an' us grain growers'd get\r\njustice.  Instead, where is it?--in the hands of a pussy-footed,\r\nhifalutin' bunch o' political windbags in the East who don't care a\r\ndamn about us hayseeds out West!  An' what's more----\"\r\n\r\n\"The Royal Mounted stood for law and order, Bob; but you'd class\r\nyourself with the half-breeds, would you?  Have another little\r\nrebellion like that of '85 with all the----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not like '85,\" interrupted the rancher.  \"No, sir, this one'll be\r\nbloodless; but it'll knock the spots off the 'breeds' little shindig\r\nall the samee!\"\r\n\r\n\"You spoke of rifles, McNair.  Guns go off,\" interpolated the other\r\nsententiously.  \"What'n the mischief do you expect to gain by that sort\r\nof thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hearing, by Jingo!  That's more'n all your letters to the papers an'\r\nyour meetin's an' resolutions have got us.  We'll show 'em we mean\r\nbusiness----\"\r\n\r\n\"Rot!  How did we get the Royal Commission except by those letters and\r\nmeetings?  That put the Manitoba Grain Act on the statutes, didn't it?\r\nMean to say we're no farther ahead?  We've got the whole grain trade\r\nunder control and supervision----\"\r\n\r\n\"Like ducks you have!\" The former rancher threw back his head and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"We've got the privilege of loading our wheat direct on cars through\r\nthe flat warehouses or any other way we like----\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the good o' that if a man can't get a car when he wants it?\"\r\ndemanded McNair impatiently.  \"The elevator gang 've organized to grab\r\neverything in sight.  I know it.  You know it.  Everybody knows it, by\r\nheaven!  So what's the use o' talkin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to be fair, though.  The elevator people have put a lot of\r\nmoney--Say, why can't we organize, too?\" suggested Motherwell with a\r\nflash of inspiration.  \"We haven't tried that yet.  That's\r\nconstitutional.  That's what the livestock breeders have done,\" he said\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nMcNair shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, Bill, it's too late for that sort o' thing,\" he objected.\r\n\"Unless you mean organizin' to fight--\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"With guns, if necessary?\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly not to shoot anybody.  The showin' mebbe'll turn the trick.\r\nNow, look here.  My idea is that if a bunch of us fellows got together\r\non the quiet some night an' seized a few elevators--Say, wouldn't it\r\nbring things to a head so quick we'd get action?  The law's there, but\r\nthese fellows are deliberately breakin' it an' we got to show 'em----\"\r\n\r\n\"The action you'd get would be the wrong kind, Mac,\" protested W. R.\r\nMotherwell emphatically.  \"You'd land in jail!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't see it that way,\" persisted McNair.  \"Wouldn't give a\r\ncontinental if I did so long's it woke a few people up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you you're on the wrong trail unless you want to get it where\r\nthe chicken got the axe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doggone it, man!  Ain't that where we're gettin' it _now_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereas with the right kind of organization----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't believe it,\" grunted McNair, starting to climb back to his\r\nhorse.  \"The time for any more o' these here granny tea-parties is past\r\nto my way o' thinkin' an' if we can't agree on it, we'd better shut up\r\nbefore we get mad.\"  He vaulted easily into the saddle.  \"But I'll tell\r\nyou one thing, W. R.--there's the sweetest little flare-up you ever saw\r\non its way.  I was talkin' the other day to Ed. Partridge, the Railton\r\nboys, Al. Quigley, Billy Bonner and some more----\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll bet they gave you a lot of sound advice, Mac!\" laughed\r\nMotherwell confidently.\r\n\r\n\"That's alright,\" resented McNair, the tan of his cheek deepening a\r\ntrifle.  \"They're a pretty sore bunch an' a fellow from down Turtle\r\nMountain way in Manitoba told me----\"\r\n\r\n\"That the mud-turtle and the jack-rabbit finally agreed that slow and\r\nsteady----\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!  You're sure hopeless,\" grinned the owner of the Two-Bar, giving\r\nhis horse the rein.\r\n\r\n\"Hope_ful_,\" corrected W. R. Motherwell with a laugh.  \"Tell Wilson, if\r\nyou see him, that Peter Dayman and I are expecting him over next week,\r\nwill you?  And I say, Mac, don't kill too many before you get home!\" he\r\ncalled in final jocularity.\r\n\r\nThe flying horseman waved his hat and his \"S'long\" came back faintly.\r\nThe other watched till horse and rider lost themselves among the\r\ndistant wheat stocks.  The twinkle died out of his eyes as he watched.\r\n\r\nSo McNair was another of them, eh?  After all, that was only to be\r\nexpected of an old Indian fighter and cow-puncher like him.  Poor Bob!\r\nHe had his reputation to sustain among the newcomers--hard rider, hard\r\nfighter, hard drinker; to do it under the changed conditions naturally\r\nrequired some hard talking on occasion.  While Mac had become civilized\r\nenough to keep one foot in a cowhide boot planted in the practical\r\npresent, the other foot was still moccasined and loath to forget the\r\ndays of war-paint and whiskey-traders, feathers and fears.  Over the\r\ncrudities and hardships, the dirt and poverty, the years between had\r\nhung a kindly curtain of glamor; so that McNair with his big soft\r\nkerchiefs, his ranger's hat, his cow-puncher's saddle and trappings and\r\nhis \"Two-Bar\" brand was a figure to crane an Eastern neck.\r\n\r\nLikeable enough chap--too much of a man to be treated as a joke to his\r\nface, but by no means to be taken seriously--not on most occasions.  In\r\nthe present instance, with feeling running as high as it was in some\r\nquarters, that crazy idea of seizing a few elevators at the point of a\r\ngun--!  What in heaven's name would they do with them after they got\r\nthem?  Nevertheless, McNair might find rattle-brained listeners enough\r\nto cause a heap of trouble.  There were always a few fellows ready for\r\nexcitement; they might go in for the fun of it, then before they knew\r\nit the thing would curdle over night like a pan of milk in a\r\nthunder-storm.\r\n\r\n\"He's just darn fool enough to try some funny work,\" muttered the\r\nanxious driver of the grain wagon.  \"Jailing him only makes a hero of\r\nhim and that's the kind of thing the beggar glories in.  The\r\nson-of-a-gun!\"\r\n\r\nOne by one throughout the afternoon the miles crept tediously beneath\r\nthe wagon.  The sun which had steeped the stubble in gold all day had\r\nturned the sky and was poising for its nightly dip below the horizon by\r\nthe time the long misty blue line of the Qu'Appelle hills began to\r\ncreep from the prairie.  When the lone traveller at last could count\r\nthe deep shadowy coulees the sun had disappeared, but the riot of\r\nafter-fires still burned brightly in the west.  He had passed his own\r\nplace hours before, but had stopped there only for a change of horses\r\nand a brief rest; a parcel and an important message which he wished to\r\ndeliver in person at Fort Qu'Appelle without delay was extending his\r\nday's journey.\r\n\r\nSix hundred feet below the level of the plain the grassy slopes of the\r\nQu'Appelle Valley bowled to the blue lakes.  Hugging the water's edge,\r\nthe buildings of the romantic old fort scattered in the twilight.  The\r\nwinding trail stood out like a white thread that reached down the\r\nvalley towards the Catholic Mission of Lebret.\r\n\r\nBefore heading into the steep descent the farmer from over Abernethy\r\nway slipped on his heavy cardigan jacket; for behind the rim of the\r\nhills the sunset fires were dying and already the coolness of the\r\nOctober night was making itself felt.  At the mouth of a coulee he\r\nspoke to a solitary Indian, standing motionless before a camp fire.\r\nThe appetizing odor of roasting wild fowl reminded him that he was more\r\nthan ready for the \"bite to eat\" which he would enjoy with the good\r\nFather Hugonard at the Indian Mission--he of the dark, gentle eyes, the\r\nquick understanding, the quiet tones.  There would be much to talk\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nSo it proved.  The hour was growing late when finally he bade good-bye\r\nto his pleasant host and resumed his journey in the starlight,\r\nrefreshed and encouraged.  For here in the seclusion of this peaceful\r\nvalley, since the days of the great buffalo herds, Father Hugonard had\r\nministered to the Indians, starved with them, worked patiently with\r\nthem through many seasons of flowers and snows.  Nevertheless, out of\r\nmany discouragements and privations had this sterling man retained an\r\nabiding faith in the triumph of righteousness in all things.\r\n\r\nIn the quiet beauty of the wonderful October night was little place for\r\nthe anxious thoughts of the day.  Bitterness of spirit, the bickerings\r\nof men, commercial Oppression and injustice--these were things far\r\nremoved from the planets of the Ages that sparkled like jewels in the\r\nvault of Night.  A vagrant breeze whispered in the valley sedges to the\r\nplacid lake.  High in the air, invisible, migrating _wavies_ winged\r\ninto the south, the distant gabble of their passing falling weirdly\r\nearthward.\r\n\r\nThe trail began to ascend sharply.  Off to the right the sky was\r\ngrowing rapidly lighter behind a distant hill and presently a lop of\r\nyellow moon crept slowly over the edge and rose into the air like a\r\nbroken chalice, chasing the shadows to their retreats.\r\n\r\nAs he watched it the driver of the grain wagon recalled again the old\r\nIndian legend that haunted this valley and had given it its name--how,\r\nlong ago, a young Indian chieftain was paddling his canoe through these\r\nwaters on his way to win a bride when suddenly above \"the night wind's\r\nmelancholy song\" he heard a voice calling him through the twilight.\r\n\"Qu'appelle?  Qu'appelle?\" he answered in French.  \"Who calls?\"  But\r\nonly his own voice came back in echoes while the gloom of night\r\ndeepened and a wan moon rose silently behind the distant hill.  Then\r\nwhen he reached the Indian encampment it was only to see the death\r\nfires lighted on the shore, to hear the wail of women and to learn that\r\njust before her lips had closed forever, his beloved had called for\r\nhim--just at the moon-rise.  Thus, ever since, the Indians claimed,\r\nstrange spirit voices spoke through the lone valley at every rising of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nThrilled by the beauty of the valley scene, misty in the moonlight, the\r\nbig farmer half unconsciously drew rein and listened.  All he could\r\nhear at first was the impatient stamp of his horses' feet, the mouthing\r\nof the bits as the animals tossed their heads restlessly, the clink of\r\nthe trace-chains; but presently he sensed a subdued undertone of night\r\nnoises that wafted mysteriously over the silver water.  It was nothing\r\nthat could be recognized definitely; rather was it an impression of\r\nstrangely merged minor sounds that grew upon him as imagination was\r\ngiven play under the influence of time and place.  It was easy to\r\nsupply interpretations of that faint medley, even while one knew that\r\nit was merely the murmur of night airs in the dry grasses, the whisper\r\nof the water-edges, the stirring of restless water-fowl in the dying\r\nreeds.\r\n\r\nThe man who had ridden all day with his thoughts began unconsciously to\r\napply other meanings to the sound, to people the night with dim faces\r\nand shapes that came trooping over the edge of the tablelands\r\nabove--toil-bent figures of old pioneer farmers, care-worn faces of\r\nwomen and bright eager faces of little children who were holding out\r\ntheir hands trustfully to the future.  There seemed to be a\r\nnever-ending procession--faces that were apathetic from repeated\r\ndisappointments, faces that scowled threateningly, brave faces tense\r\nwith determination and sad faces on which was written the story of\r\nstruggle hidden within many a lonely wind-buffeted shack on the great\r\nbosom of the prairie.\r\n\r\nWas it, then, that all the years of toil and hardship were to come to\r\nnaught for this great company of honest workers, these brave pioneer\r\nmen and women of the soil?  Was all their striving forward to find them\r\nmerely marking time, shouldered into the backwater while the currents\r\nof organized commercialism swept away their opportunities?  Were not\r\nthese producers of the world's bread themselves to partake of the\r\nfruits of their labor?\r\n\r\nYes!  Surely the answer was _Yes_!  It was their Right.  Wrong could\r\nnot endure forever in the face of Right; else were the world a poor\r\nplace, Life itself a failure, the mystic beauty of God's calm night a\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\nThe man from Abernethy roused himself.  It would be nearly dawn before\r\nhis team would reach their home stalls.  He whistled to the horses and\r\nthey plunged into the black shadows of the coulee up which the trail\r\nrose in steep ascent from the valley.  When they emerged into the\r\nmoonlight he drew rein for a moment.\r\n\r\nSomewhere back in a forgotten arroyo a coyote yapped lonesomely.\r\nAround through the night were flung the distant glow-dots of the\r\nburning straw piles, and as he filled his lungs with the fresh sweet\r\nair the hope of better days warmed the heart of the belated traveller.\r\nThe Hand which set the orbits of the universe created the laws of Truth\r\nand Justice and these never could be gainsaid.  Everything would come\r\nout aright if only men were steadfast in faith and duty.\r\n\r\nHe gave the horses their heads and they were off once more through the\r\ncool night upon the wheatland sea that was bounded only by far purple\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, Western Canada, were not\r\ncreated until 1906.  Prior to that the entire country west of the\r\nProvince of Manitoba was known as the North-West Territories, of which\r\nthe District of Assiniboia was a part, the part which subsequently\r\nformed the southern portion of the Province of Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\n[2] Hon. W. R. Motherwell, Minister of Agriculture, Province of\r\nSaskatchewan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA CALL TO ARMS\r\n\r\nAnd my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one\r\ngathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth.--_Isaiah_\r\n10:14.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor five thousand years Man has grown wheat for food.  Archaeologists\r\nhave found it buried with the mummies of Egypt; the pictured stones of\r\nthe Pyramids record it.  But it was the food of princes, not of\r\npeasants--of the aristocracy, not of the people; for no man could\r\nharvest enough of it with his sickle to create a supply which would\r\nplace it within the reach of the poor.  While century after century[1]\r\nhas passed since wheat was first recognized as the premier nourishment\r\nfor the human body, it is only of recent times that it has become the\r\nfood of the nations.\r\n\r\nThe swift development of grain growing into the world's greatest\r\nindustry goes back for a small beginning to 1831.  It was in that year\r\nthat a young American-born farm boy of Irish-Scotch extraction was\r\njeered and laughed at as he attempted to cut wheat with the first crude\r\nreaper; but out of Cyrus Hall McCormick's invention soon grew the\r\nwonderful harvesting machinery which made possible the production of\r\nwheat for export.  Close on heel the railways and water-carriers began\r\ncompeting for the transportation of the grain, the railways pushing\r\neagerly in every direction where new wheat lands could be tapped.  In\r\n1856 wheat was leaving Chicago for Europe and four years later grain\r\nvessels from California were rounding Cape Horn.  The nine years that\r\nfollowed saw the conquest of the vast prairies of the American West\r\nwhich were crossed by the hissing, iron monsters that stampeded the\r\nfrightened bison, out-ran the wild horses and out-stayed the lurking\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the railways pushed back the frontier than wheat began to\r\ntrickle steadily upon the market, to flow with increased volume, then\r\nto pour in by train-loads.  Sacks were discarded for quicker shipment\r\nin bulk; barns and warehouses filled and spilled till adequate storage\r\nfacilities became the vital problem and, the need mothering invention,\r\nF. H. Peavey came forward with an idea--an endless chain of metal cups\r\nfor elevating grain.  From this the huge modern elevator evolved to\r\ntake its place as the grain's own particular storehouse.  With the\r\nestablishment of exchanges for conducting international buying and\r\nselling the universalizing of wheat was complete.\r\n\r\nThese things had come to pass while that great region which is now\r\nWestern Canada was still known as a Great Lone Land.  Pioneer settlers,\r\nhowever, were beginning to venture westward to the newly organized\r\nProvince of Manitoba and beyond.  The nearest railroad was at St. Paul,\r\nMinnesota, from which point a \"prairie schooner\" trail led north for\r\n450 miles to Winnipeg at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine\r\nrivers; the alternative to this overland tented-wagon route was a\r\ntedious trip by Red River steamer.  It was not until 1878 that a\r\nrailway was built north into Manitoba from St. Paul; but it was\r\nfollowed shortly after by the projection of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway, which reached Vancouver in 1886.\r\n\r\nThen began what has been called the greatest wheat-rush ever known.\r\nLand, land without end, to be had for the asking--rich land that would\r\ngrow wheat, forty bushels to the acre, millions of acres of it!\r\nFabulous tales, winging east and south, brought settlers pouring into\r\nthe new country.  They came to grow wheat and they grew it, the finest\r\nwheat in the world.  They grew it in ever increasing volume.\r\n\r\nSuccessful operation of new railroads--even ordinary railroads--is not\r\nall glistening varnish and bright new signal flags.  The Canadian\r\nPacific was no ordinary railway.  It was a young giant, reaching for\r\nthe western skyline with temerity, and it knew Trouble as it knew sun\r\nand wind and snow.  The very grain which was its life-blood gorged the\r\nembryo system till it choked.  The few elevators and other facilities\r\nprovided could not begin to handle the crop, even of 1887, the heavy\r\nyield upsetting all calculations.  The season for harvesting and\r\nmarketing being necessarily short, the railroad became the focus of a\r\nsudden belch of wheat; it required to be rushed to the head of the\r\nlakes in a race with the advancing cold which threatened to congeal the\r\nharbor waters about the anxiously waiting grain boats before they could\r\nclear.  With every wheel turning night and day no ordinary rolling\r\nstock could cope with the demands; for the grain was coming in over the\r\ntrails to the shipping points faster than it could be hauled out and\r\nthe railroad was in a fix for storage accommodation.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that such seasonal rushes would be a permanent\r\ncondition in Western Canada, vital but unavoidable; so the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway Company cast about for alleviations.  They hit upon the\r\nplan of increasing storage facilities rapidly by announcing that the\r\nCompany would make special concessions to anyone who would build\r\nelevators along the line with a capacity of not less than 26,000\r\nbushels and equipped with cleaning machinery, steam or gasoline\r\npower--in short, \"standard\" elevators.  The special inducement offered\r\nwas nothing more nor less than an agreement that at points where such\r\nelevators were erected the railway company would not allow cars to be\r\nloaded with grain through flat warehouses, direct from farmers'\r\nvehicles or in any other way than through such elevators; the only\r\n\"condition\" was that the elevator owners would furnish storage and\r\nshipping facilities, of course, for those wishing to store or ship\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nAt once the noise of hammer and saw resounded along the right-of-way.\r\nPersons and corporations whose business it was to mill grain, to buy\r\nand export it, were quick to take advantage of the opportunity; for the\r\nprotection offered by the railway meant that here was shipping control\r\nof the grain handed out on a silver platter, garnished with all the\r\ndelectable prospects of satisfying the keenest money hunger.\r\n\r\nOn all sides protests arose from the few owners of ordinary warehouses\r\nwho found their buildings useless, once the overtopping elevator went\r\nup alongside--from small buyers who found themselves being driven out\r\nof the market with the flat warehouses.  But these voices were drowned\r\nin the swish of grain in the chutes and the staccato of the elevator\r\nengines--lost in the larger exigencies of the wheat.  The railway\r\ncompany held to their promises and the tall grain boxes reared their\r\ncastor tops against the sky in increasing clusters.\r\n\r\nTo operate a standard elevator at a country point with profit it was\r\nconsidered necessary in the early days to fill it three times in a\r\nseason unless the owner proposed to deal in grain himself and make a\r\nbuyer's profit in addition to handling grain for others.  The cost of\r\nbuilding and operating the class of elevator demanded by the railway\r\ncompany was partly responsible for this.  Before long the number of\r\nelevators in Manitoba and the North-West Territories increased till it\r\nwas impossible for all of them to obtain the three fillings per season\r\neven had their owners been inclined to perform merely a handling\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nBut those who had taken up the railway's offer with such avidity and\r\nhad invested large sums of shareholders' capital in building the\r\nelevator accommodation were mostly shrewd grain dealers whose primary\r\nobject was to buy and sell.  These interested corporations were not\r\nconstructing elevators in order to admire their silhouettes against the\r\nbeautiful prairie sunsets!  In every corner of the earth the Dollar\r\nAlmighty, or its equivalent, was being stalked by all sorts and\r\nconditions of men, some of whom chased it noisily and openly while\r\nothers hunted with their boots in one hand.  Properly enough, the grain\r\nmen were out for all that their investment could earn and for all the\r\nwheat which they could buy at one price and sell at another.  That was\r\ntheir business, just as it was the business of the railway company to\r\ntransport the grain at a freight rate which would net a profit, just as\r\nit was the farmer's business--\r\n\r\nBut to the farmer it seemed that he had no business!  He merely grew\r\nthe grain.  Apparently a farmer was a pair of pants, a shirt and a\r\nslouch hat that sat on a wagon-load of wheat, drove it up the incline\r\ninto the elevator and rattled away again for another load!  To farm was\r\nan occupation easily parsed--subjunctive mood, past tense, passive\r\nvoice!  The farmer was third person, singular!  He came and went in\r\nsingle file like an Indian or a Chinaman--John Doe, Yon Yonson and\r\nJohann X (his mark)--every kind of Johnny on no spot but his own!  As\r\nsoon as his grain was dumped each of him went back to the land among\r\nthe dumb animals where the pomp and vanity of this wicked world would\r\nnot interfere with preparations for next year's crop!\r\n\r\nWheat was bought upon the grading system--so much per bushel for this\r\ngrade, so much for that, according to the fluctuations of supply and\r\ndemand upon the world's markets.  But the average farmer at that time\r\nknew little or nothing about what went on in the great exchanges of the\r\ncities; there was no means of learning the intricacies of the grain\r\nbusiness and many farmers even did not know what a grain exchange was.\r\nAll such a man knew was that his wheat was graded and he received a\r\ncertain price for it.\r\n\r\nThe railway company's refusal to furnish cars for loading direct from\r\nthe farmer's wagon compelled the shipper to sell to the elevator\r\noperator for whatever price he could get, accepting whatever weights\r\nthe operator allowed and whatever \"dockage\" he chose to decree.  The\r\nlatter represented that portion of the farmer's delivery which was\r\nsupposed to come through the cleaning sieves as waste material such as\r\ndirt, weed seeds, broken wheat kernels, etc.  To determine the\r\npercentage of dockage in any given load of wheat the ordinary human\r\nbeing would require to weigh and clean a pound of it at least; but so\r\nexpert were many of the elevator operators of those days that they had\r\nno trouble at all in arriving at the dockage by a single glance.  Nor\r\nwere they disconcerted by the fact that the country was new and grain\r\nfrequently came from the thresher in a remarkably clean condition.\r\n\r\nWith everything thus fallow for seeds of discord the Big Trouble was\r\nnot long in making itself manifest.  All over the country the Bumping\r\nof the Bumpkins apparently became the favorite pastime of elevator men.\r\nCertain persons with most of their calluses on the inside cracked the\r\nwhip and the three-ring circus began.  Excessive dockage, short\r\nweights, depressed prices!  The farmers grew more and more bitter as\r\ntime passed.  To begin with, they resented being compelled by the\r\nrailway to deal with the elevators; it was a violation of that liberty\r\nwhich they had a right to enjoy as British citizens.  The grain was\r\ntheirs to sell where they liked, and when on top of the refusal to let\r\nthem do it came this bleeding of their crops, their indignation was\r\nfanned to white heat.\r\n\r\nIt was useless for the farmers to build elevators of their own; for\r\nthese had to conform to the requirements of the railway and, as already\r\nstated, it was impossible to run them profitably without making a\r\nbuyer's profit in addition to the commission for handling and storage.\r\nThe farmers were not buyers but sellers of grain and with very few\r\nexceptions, where conditions were specially favorable, the farmers'\r\nelevators that were attempted were soon in difficulties.\r\n\r\nLeading farmers began to write strong letters to the newspapers and it\r\nwas not long before the agitation became so widespread that it reached\r\nthe floor of Parliament.  Mr. James M. Douglas, member for East\r\nAssiniboia, during two successive sessions introduced Bills to regulate\r\nthe shipping and transportation of grain in Manitoba and the North-West\r\nTerritories and these were discussed in the House of Commons.  A\r\nSpecial Committee of the House was appointed finally to investigate the\r\nmerits of the case and as considerable difference of opinion was\r\nexpressed as to the actual facts, the appointment of a Royal Commission\r\nto make a full and impartial investigation of the whole subject in the\r\npublic interest was recommended.\r\n\r\nThis Royal Commission accordingly was appointed on October 7th, 1899,\r\nand consisted of three Manitoba farmers--W. F. Sirett, of Glendale;\r\nWilliam Lothian, of Pipestone, and Charles C. Castle, of Foxton--with\r\nHis Honor E. J. Senkler, of St. Catharines, Ontario, as Chairman;\r\nCharles N. Bell, of Winnipeg, acted as Secretary.  Owing to the illness\r\nand death of Judge Senkler, Albert Elswood Richards (afterwards the\r\nlate Hon. Mr. Justice Richards, of Winnipeg), succeeded as Chairman in\r\nFebruary, 1900.\r\n\r\nSittings were held at many places throughout Manitoba and the\r\nNorth-West Territories and much evidence was taken as to the grievances\r\ncomplained of, these being mainly: (1) That vendors of grain were being\r\nsubjected to unfair and excessive dockage at the time of sale; (2) That\r\ndoubt existed as to the fairness of the weights allowed or used by\r\nowners of elevators; (3) That the owners of elevators enjoyed a\r\nmonopoly in the purchase of grain by refusing to permit the erection of\r\nflat warehouses where standard elevators were situated and were thus\r\nable to keep prices of grain below true value to their own benefit and\r\nthe disadvantage of the public generally as well as others who were\r\nspecially interested in the grain trade.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the railway companies had hastened to announce that they\r\nwould furnish cars to farmers who wished to ship direct and do their\r\nown loading.  This concession, made in 1898-9, resulted in somewhat\r\nbetter prices and better treatment from the elevator operators.  But\r\nfarmers who lived more than four or five miles from the shipping points\r\ncould not draw in their grain fast enough to load a car within the time\r\nallowed by the railway; so that the situation, so far as these farmers\r\nwere concerned, remained practically unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1900, the Royal Commission made a complete report.  They had\r\ndone their work thoroughly.  They found that so long as any farmer was\r\nhampered in shipping to terminal markets himself he would be more or\r\nless at the mercy of elevator operators and that the only proper relief\r\nfrom the possibility of undue dockage and price depression was to be\r\nfound in the utmost freedom of shipping and selling.  To this end they\r\nconsidered that the railroads should be compelled by law to furnish\r\nfarmers with cars for shipping their own grain and that flat warehouses\r\nshould be allowed so that the farmer could have a bin in which to\r\naccumulate a carload of grain, if he so wished.  This, the\r\ncommissioners thought, should be the farmer's legal right rather than\r\nhis privilege.  Loading platforms for the free use of shippers were\r\nalso recommended.\r\n\r\nIt was the further opinion of the Commission that the law should compel\r\nelevator and warehouse owners to guarantee the grades and weights of a\r\nfarmer's grain and to do this the adoption of a uniform grain ticket\r\nsystem was suggested.  At the same time, the commissioners pointed out,\r\nthese guarantees might lead to such careful grading and docking by the\r\nelevator operator as might appear to the farmer to be undergrading or\r\noverdocking; so that the farmer's right to load direct on cars was a\r\nnecessary supplementary protection.\r\n\r\nThe annual shortage of cars during the rush season following harvest\r\nwas found to be a direct cause of depression in prices.  When cars were\r\nnot available for immediate shipments the grain soon piled up on the\r\nelevator companies who were thereby forced to miss the cheaper\r\ntransportation by boat from the head of the lakes or assume the risk of\r\ncarrying over the grain until the following spring; in buying,\r\ntherefore, they naturally allowed a wide margin to cover all possible\r\ncontingencies.  Increase of transportation facilities during October\r\nand November accordingly was imperative.\r\n\r\nWith no rules to regulate the grain trade except those laid down by the\r\nrailways and the elevator owners, the need was great for definite\r\nlegislation similar to that which obtained in the State of Minnesota\r\nand, as a result of the Royal Commission's recommendations, the\r\nManitoba Grain Act was placed upon the statutes and became operative in\r\n1900.  To supervise the carrying out of the law in connection with the\r\ngrain trade a Warehouse Commissioner was appointed, Mr. C. C. Castle\r\nwho acted on the Royal Commission being selected for this responsible\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nA sigh of relief went up from many intelligent farmers who had begun to\r\nworry over the conditions developing; for they looked upon the Manitoba\r\nGrain Act as a sort of Magna Charta.  With the grain trade under\r\nofficial control and supervision along the lines laid down by the Royal\r\nCommission, they felt that everything would be alright now.  It was\r\nlike calling in a policeman to investigate suspicious noises in the\r\nhouse; like welcoming the doctor's arrival upon an occasion of sudden\r\nand severe illness.  Unfortunately, the patient's alarming symptoms\r\nsometimes continue; sometimes the thief makes a clean get-away; King\r\nJohn had no sooner left Runnymede than he proceeded to ignore the Great\r\nCharter and plan new and heavier scutages upon the people!\r\n\r\nUp till now the elevator owners had been operating with nothing more\r\ndefinite than a fellowship of interests to hold them together; but upon\r\nappearance of the Grain Act they proceeded to organize the North West\r\nElevator Association, afterwards called the North West Grain Dealers'\r\nAssociation.  By agreeing on the prices which they would pay for wheat\r\nout in the country and by pooling receipts the members of such an\r\norganization, the farmers suspected, would be in a position to strangle\r\ncompetition in buying.\r\n\r\nThe new Act was aiming point blank at these very things by affording\r\nthe farmer an opportunity of loading his grain direct into cars through\r\nflat warehouses, if he chose, and shipping where he liked.  But because\r\nmany farmers did not know with just what the new weapon was loaded or\r\nhow to pull the trigger, the railways and elevators merely stepped up\r\nand smilingly brushed the whole thing aside as something which were\r\nbetter hanging on a high peg out of harm's way.\r\n\r\nThe crop of 1900 being comparatively light, the ignoring of the\r\ncar-distribution clauses of the Act did not obtrude as brazenly as it\r\ndid the year following.  But when grain began to pour in to the\r\nshipping points in 1901 and the farmers found the railway unheeding\r\ntheir requests for cars their disgust and disappointment were as\r\ncomplete as their anger was swift.  It was the rankling disappointment\r\nof men whose rights have been officially decreed only to be\r\nunofficially annulled; it was the hot anger of a slap in the face--the\r\nanger that makes men fight with every ounce of their strength.\r\n\r\nThe quick welling of it planted anxiety in the minds of such\r\nlevel-headed farmers as W. R. Motherwell and Peter Dayman, of\r\nAbernethy; Williams, of Balcarres; Snow, of Wolseley; Sibbold and\r\nMillar, of Indian Head.  While the two latter were riding into town\r\nwith wheat one day John Sibbold suggested to John Millar that, as\r\nsecretary of the local Agricultural Society, it might be a good thing\r\nif he called a meeting to talk things over.  It was the high state of\r\nfeeling manifested at this meeting which furnished W. R. Motherwell\r\nwith food for thought on the lonely Qu'Appelle trail.  And it was the\r\nidea that it might be advisable to hold similar mass meetings\r\nthroughout the country that brought Peter Dayman driving over to the\r\nMotherwell place, not long after, to discuss it.\r\n\r\nThese two men had been friends and neighbors since 1883.  Each of them\r\nfelt that the time had come for definite action of some kind and they\r\nspent the greater part of the day in talking over the situation in\r\nsearch of the most practical plan of campaign.  There was little use in\r\nthe farmers attempting to organize in defence of their own interests\r\nunless the effort were absolutely united and along broader lines than\r\nthose of any previous farmers' organization.  Politics, they both\r\nagreed, would have to be kept out of the movement at all costs or it\r\nwould land on the rocks of defeat in the same way that the Farmers'\r\nUnion and Patrons of Industry had been wrecked.\r\n\r\nIt was in the middle eighties when the West was settled but sparsely\r\nthat the farmers had attempted to improve their lot by the formation of\r\n\"Farmers' Unions.\"  The movement had had a brief and not very brilliant\r\ncareer and as the offspring of this attempt at organization some\r\nprogressives with headquarters at Brandon, Manitoba, had tried to enter\r\nthe grain trade as an open company.  When one of the chief officers of\r\nthis concern defected in an attempt to get rich the failure dragged\r\ndown the earnest promoters to deep financial losses.\r\n\r\nAgain in the early nineties the farmers had rebelled at their pioneer\r\nhardships by organizing the \"Patrons of Industry,\" a movement which had\r\ngained strength and for a while looked healthy.  It had got strong\r\nenough to elect friends to the Legislature and was sowing good seed\r\nwhen again temptation appeared, centred in the lure of commercial\r\nsuccess and politics.  Some of the chief officers began to misuse the\r\norganization for selfish ends and away went the whole thing.\r\n\r\nThere was no use in repeating these defeats.  Couldn't some way be\r\ndevised of sidestepping such pitfalls?  The great weakness of the\r\nfarmers was their individual independence; if they could be taught to\r\nstand together for their common interests there was hope that something\r\nmight be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe sitting-room clock ticked away the hours unheeded as these two\r\nfar-sighted and conscientious farmers lost themselves in earnest\r\ndiscussion.  The lamps were lighted, but still they planned.\r\n\r\nFinally W. R. Motherwell reached across the table for a pad of\r\nnote-paper and drafted the call to arms--a letter which summoned the\r\nmen of Wolseley, Sintaluta and Indian Head, of Qu'Appelle, Wideawake\r\nand other places to gather for _action_.  There and then copies were\r\nwritten out for every leading farmer within reach, and in order that no\r\npolitical significance might be attached to the call, both men signed\r\nthe letters.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter Dayman drove away from the Motherwell place that night\r\nperhaps he scarcely realized that he carried in his pocket the fate of\r\nthe farmers of Western Canada.  Neither he, W. R. Motherwell, nor any\r\nother man could have foretold the bitter struggles which those letters\r\nwere destined to unleash--the stirring events that were impending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wheat was first grown in Canada in 1606 at Port Royal (now\r\nAnnapolis) in Nova Scotia, where Champlain and Pourtincourt built a\r\nfort and established a small colony.  A plot of ground was made ready\r\nand wheat planted.  \"It grew under the snow,\" said Pourtincourt, \"and\r\nin the following midsummer it was harvested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SHOT IS FIRED\r\n\r\nLet us have faith that Right makes Might, and in that faith let us dare\r\nto do our duty as we understand it.--_Abraham Lincoln_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth of December, 1901, was a memorable day in the little\r\nprairie town of Indian Head.  Strangers from East and West had begun to\r\narrive the night before and early in the day the accommodations were\r\ntaxed to the limit while the livery stables were overflowing with the\r\nteams of farmers from every direction.  All forenoon the trails were\r\ndotted with incoming sleighs and the groups which began to congregate\r\non Main Street grew rapidly in size and number.  The shop-keepers had\r\nstayed up half the night to put the final touches to their holiday\r\ndecorations and make their final preparations for the promised rush of\r\nChristmas buying.\r\n\r\nMany prominent men would grace the town with their presence before\r\nnightfall.  The Premier of the North-West Territories, Hon. F. W. G.\r\nHaultain, would be on hand, as well as Hon. G. H. V. Bulyea and Senator\r\nWilliam D. Perley; coming to meet them here would be Premier R. P.\r\nRoblin and other gentlemen of Manitoba.  Certain boundary matters,\r\ninvolving the addition of a part of Assiniboia to the Province of\r\nManitoba, were to be discussed at a public meeting in the Town Hall at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Motherwell and Dayman had chosen their date well, many farmers\r\nhaving planned already to be at Indian Head on the 18th.  The grain\r\ngrowers' meeting was announced for the afternoon and so keen was the\r\ninterest that when order was called the chairman faced between sixty\r\nand seventy-five farmers, as well as a number of public men, instead of\r\nthe dozen-or-so whom W. R. Motherwell had ventured to expect.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was December out of doors, the temperature of that meeting\r\nwas about one hundred in the shade!  As the discussion expanded feeling\r\nran high.  Farmer after farmer got to his feet and told the facts as he\r\nknew them, his own personal experiences and those of his neighbors.\r\nThere was no denying the evidence that it was full time the farmers\r\nbestirred themselves.\r\n\r\nW. R. Motherwell and Peter Dayman spoke earnestly in favor of immediate\r\norganization along strong, sane lines.  The farmer was always referred\r\nto as the most independent man on earth, and so he was; but it was\r\nindividual independence only.  He had come lumbering into the country\r\nbehind his own oxen with his family and all his worldly goods in his\r\nown wagon; had built a roof over their heads with his own hands.  Alone\r\non the prairie, he had sweated and wrestled with the problem of getting\r\nenough to eat.  One of the very first things the pioneer learned was to\r\nstand on his own two feet--to do things by himself.  His isolation, the\r\nobstacles he had overcome by his own planning, the hardships he had\r\nendured and survived--these were the excuses for his assertiveness, his\r\nindividualism, his hostility to the restrictions of organization.  He\r\nwas a horse for work; but it was an effort for him to do team work\r\nbecause he was not used to it.\r\n\r\nThis was the big barrier which would have to be surmounted in the\r\nbeginning if battle were to be waged successfully against present\r\noppressive conditions.  The right kind of organization was the key that\r\nwould unlock a happier future.  The farmer was as much a producer as\r\nany manufacturer who made finished articles out of raw material; but\r\nhis was the only business in which full energies were expended upon\r\nproduction of goods to sell while the marketing end was left for the\r\n\"other fellow\" to organize.  That was why he was obliged to do as he\r\nwas told, take what was given him or haul his wheat home and eat it\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLike all such meetings, it was not without its few pails of cold water.\r\nThese were emptied by some who hinted dark things about \"political\r\nreasons,\" and it was easy to make the trite statement that history\r\nrepeats itself and to predict that the formation of such a farmers'\r\nassociation as was proposed would be riding only for the same fall\r\nwhich had overtaken former attempts.  The enthusiasm refused to be\r\ndampened and it broke out in unmistakable accents when without waste of\r\nwords Angus McKay nominated W. R. Motherwell as provisional President\r\nof the \"Territorial Grain Growers' Association.\"  John Millar as\r\nprovisional Secretary and a board of directors[1] were quickly chosen.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over and Senator William D. Perley rose slowly to his\r\nfeet, it was to deliver a parting message of confidence that the\r\nfarmers were taking the right step in the right manner.  There were few\r\nmen who could be listened to with greater respect than the elderly\r\nSenator and as the silence of his audience deepened it was almost as if\r\nthe white-haired gentleman's dignified words were prophetic.  He had\r\nbeen familiar with a somewhat similar movement in New Brunswick, he\r\nsaid, and back there by the Atlantic this movement was still very much\r\nalive and doing good work.  Long after those who were present at this\r\nmeeting had passed away, it was his prediction that this newborn\r\norganization of prairie farmers would be living still, still expanding\r\nand still performing a useful service to the farmers generally.\r\n\r\nThe meeting adjourned with the general feeling that at last matters\r\nwere advancing beyond mere talk.  The sixth of January was set as the\r\ndate for a second meeting to draft a constitution and prepare a\r\ndefinite plan of campaign.  Emphasis was laid upon the importance of a\r\ngood attendance; but when the date arrived the leaders of the new\r\nmovement were disappointed to find that, including themselves, there\r\nwere just eleven farmers present.  While this did not look very\r\npromising, they proceeded with their plans and it is a tribute to the\r\ncareful thought expended at that time that the constitution then framed\r\nhas stood the test of many years, even much of the exact phraseology\r\nremaining to-day.  The idea of having local associations scattered\r\nthroughout the country, each with its own officers, governed by a\r\ncentral organization with its special officers, was adopted from the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nAmong those present was C. W. Peterson, Deputy Commissioner of\r\nAgriculture for the North-West Territories.  He freely offered his\r\nservices in the capacity of secretary; but the offer was turned down so\r\nflat and so quickly that it was breath-taking.  The incident reflected\r\nvery vividly the jealousy with which the farmers were guarding the new\r\nmovement rather than any depreciation of the Deputy Commissioner's\r\nability; every man of them was on the alert to deflect the thinnest\r\npolitical wedge, imagined or otherwise, that might come along.  They\r\nwould trust nobody with an official connection and the appointment of\r\nJohn Millar, who was one of themselves, was confirmed without loss of\r\ntime.  There was no salary attached to any office, of course; nobody\r\nthought of salaries.  The farmers who knew the feel of spare cash in\r\nthose days were seventh sons of seventh sons.\r\n\r\nWinter and all as it was, the leaders of the young organization did not\r\nlet the snow pack under their feet.  No sooner were the preliminaries\r\nover than they set about preparing for the first convention of the\r\nAssociation by hitching up and travelling the country, organizing local\r\nassociations.  W. R. Motherwell, John Millar and Matt. Snow, of\r\nWolseley, tucked the robes around them and jingled away in different\r\ndirections.  Wherever they went they were listened to eagerly and the\r\nresulting action was instantaneous.  The movement took hold of the\r\nfarmers like wildfire; so that by February thirty-eight local grain\r\ngrowers' associations had been formed, each sending enthusiastic\r\ndelegates to the first Annual Convention, which was held at Indian Head\r\nin February, 1902.\r\n\r\nAll that summer, pacing the rapidly growing wheat, the Territorial\r\nGrain Growers' Association spread and took root till by harvest time it\r\nwas standing everywhere in the field, a thrifty and full-headed\r\nchampion of farmers' rights, lacking only the ripening of experience.\r\nThere had been as yet no particular opportunity to demonstrate its\r\nusefulness in dollars and cents; but with the approach of the fall and\r\nmarket season the whole organization grew tense with expectancy.  There\r\nseemed little reason to believe that the railway people would do other\r\nthan attempt to continue their old methods of distributing cars where\r\nand when they chose and to disregard, as before, those provisions of\r\nthe Grain Act which aimed to protect the farmer in getting his fair\r\nshare of cars in which to load direct.\r\n\r\nThus it soon turned out.  The officers of the Association at once\r\nwarned the Canadian Pacific Railway Company that if they persisted in\r\nsuch practice the farmers would be compelled to take legal action\r\nagainst them.  It looked so much like the attack of a toddling child\r\nagainst a man full grown that the big fellow laughed good-naturedly.\r\nWho, pray, were the \"Territorial Grain Growers' Association\"?\r\n\r\n\"We represent the farmers of Western Canada,\" retorted the unabashed\r\nofficers of the little organization \"and we want what the law allows us\r\nas our right.  What's more, we propose to get it!\"\r\n\r\nThat was about the message which W. R. Motherwell and Peter Dayman went\r\ndown to Winnipeg to deliver in person to the Canadian Pacific Railway\r\nCompany.  The official whom they interviewed manipulated the necessary\r\nlevers to start the matter on its way through the \"proper channels\"\r\ntowards that \"serious consideration\" into which all good politicians\r\nand corporation officials take everything that comes unexpectedly\r\nbefore them.  W. R. Motherwell could not wait for the unfolding of this\r\nhardy perennial and left Peter Dayman at Winnipeg to follow up\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nWhen the latter got back home he brought with him a bagful of promises.\r\nThe practical improvement in the situation which was to support these\r\npromises, however, evidently got wrapped up in somebody else's order\r\nand delivered to another address.  As soon as the Association were\r\nsatisfied that relief was not to be forthcoming they promptly filled\r\nout a standard form of information and complaint and notified the\r\nrailway that they were going to take legal action at Sintaluta against\r\nthe Company's station agent; if no results were forthcoming there, they\r\nassured the Company, they would take action against every railway agent\r\nin the Territories who was guilty of distributing cars contrary to the\r\nprovisions of the Grain Act.  The complaint went before Mr. C. C.\r\nCastle, the official Warehouse Commissioner; the information was laid\r\nbefore Magistrate H. O. Partridge at Sintaluta.\r\n\r\nAll over the country the newspapers began to devote valuable space to\r\nthe impending trial.  It was talked about in bar-rooms and\r\nbarber-shops.  Some anti-railroaders declared at once that the farmers\r\nhadn't a minute's chance to win against the C. P. R.  The news\r\npercolated eastward, its significance getting lighter till it became\r\nmerely: \"a bunch of fool hayseeds out West in some kind of trouble with\r\nthe C. P. R.--cows run over, or something.\"  At Ottawa, however, were\r\nthose who saw handwriting on the wall and they awaited the outcome with\r\nconsiderable interest.  Several public men, especially from Regina,\r\nmade ready to be in actual attendance at the preliminary trial.\r\n\r\nThe farmers were out in force, for they realized the importance of this\r\ntest case.  It was not the agent at Sintaluta they were fighting, but\r\nthe railway itself; it was not this specific instance of unjust car\r\ndistribution that would be settled, but all other like infringements\r\nalong the line.  The very efficacy of the Grain Act itself was\r\nchallenged.\r\n\r\nTwo hours before the Magistrate's Court sat to consider the case, J. A.\r\nM. Aikins (now Sir James Aikins, Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba), who\r\nwas there as the legal representative of the C. P. R., tapped the\r\nPresident of the farmers' Association on the elbow.\r\n\r\n\"Let's make a real case of it while we're at it,\" he smiled, and\r\nproceeded to suggest that instead of laying information against the\r\nrailway company on two charges, the Association should charge them also\r\nwith violating some five or six other sections of the Act.  \"Then we'll\r\nhave a decision on them, too, you see.  For the purpose of this case\r\nthe Company will plead guilty to the offences.  What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do it, W. R.!  Not on your life, Mister!\"\r\n\r\nThe farmers within earshot crowded about the two.  They suspected\r\ntrickery in such a last-minute suggestion; either the railway people\r\nwere very sure they had the case in their pocket or they were up to\r\nsome smooth dodge, you bet!\r\n\r\nPresident Motherwell shook his head dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"How can we change the information on such short notice?\" he objected.\r\n\"It would mean risking an adjournment of the court.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what they're after!  Stick to him, Motherwell!\"\r\n\r\nBut it did seem very advisable to have the meaning of those other\r\ndoubtful sections of the Act cleared up, and as C. P. R. counsel went\r\nmore fully into the matter the desirability of it for both sides became\r\neven more apparent.\r\n\r\n\"Tell you what we'll do, Mr. Aikins,\" said W. R. Motherwell, finally\r\nturning to him after consulting the others, \"if you'll give your\r\npledged word before this assembled crowd of farmers that you won't take\r\nany technical advantage of the change you've suggested us making in the\r\ninformation--by raising objections when court opens, I mean--why, we'll\r\nmake the change.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" agreed Mr. Aikins without hesitation, and in solemn\r\nsilence he and the President of the Association shook hands.\r\n\r\nThis alteration in the information made the issue even more\r\nfar-reaching and it was a tense moment for the farmers who packed the\r\nlittle court room when the Magistrate opened proceedings and on behalf\r\nof the Warehouse Commissioner, Mr. T. Q. Mathers (now Chief Justice\r\nMathers, of Winnipeg), rose to his feet for argument.  After the\r\nevidence was complete and the Magistrate at last handed down his\r\ndecision--fifty dollars fine and costs, to be paid by the\r\ndefendant--the victorious grain growers were jubilant and especially\r\nwere the officers of the young Association proud of the outcome.\r\n\r\nThe case was carried to the Supreme Court by the Railway Company, which\r\nmade every effort to have the decision of the lower court reversed.\r\nWhen the appeal case came to trial, much to the disgust and chagrin of\r\nthe railway authorities and the corresponding elation of the farmers,\r\nthe Magistrate's decision was sustained.  At once the newspapers all\r\nover the country were full of it.  Oracles of bar-room and barber-shop\r\nnodded their heads wisely; hadn't they said that even the C. P. R.\r\ncouldn't win against organized farmers, backed up by the law of the\r\nland?  Away East the news was magnified till it became: \"The farmers\r\nout West have licked the C. P. R. in court and are threatening to tear\r\nup the tracks!\"  At Ottawa Members of Parliament dug into Hansard to\r\nsee if they had said anything when the Manitoba Grain Act was passed.\r\n\r\nEmpty cars began to roll into Western sidings and they were not all\r\nspotted to suit the elevators but were for farmers who had signified a\r\ndesire to load direct.  It was unnecessary to carry out the threat of\r\nproceeding against every delinquent railway agent in the Territories;\r\nfor the delinquencies were no longer deliberate.  The book in which by\r\nturn the orders for cars were listed began to be a more honest record\r\nof precedence in distribution, as all good car-order books should be.\r\n\r\nFor the railway authorities were men of wide experience and ability,\r\nwho knew when they were defeated and how to accept such defeat\r\ngracefully.  It meant merely that the time had come to recognize the\r\nfact that there was a man inside the soil-grimed shirt.  The farmer had\r\nwon his spurs.  While the railway people did not like the action of the\r\nAssociation in hauling them into court, in all fairness they were ready\r\nto admit that they had received full warning before such drastic action\r\nwas taken.\r\n\r\nIf the railway officials began to regard the farmer in a new light, the\r\nlatter on his part began to appreciate somewhat more fully the task\r\nwhich faced these energetic men in successfully handling the giant\r\norganization for which they assumed responsibility.  After the tilt,\r\ntherefore, instead of the leaders of the grain growers and the railway\r\nlooking at each other with less friendly eyes, their relations became\r\nmore kindly as each began to entertain for the other a greater respect.\r\n\r\nBest of all, applications were beginning to pour in upon the Secretary\r\nof the Territorial Grain Growers' Association--applications from\r\nfarmers everywhere for admission to the organization.  Skeptics who had\r\nbeen holding out now enrolled with their local association and, as fast\r\nas they could be handled, new locals were being formed.\r\n\r\nAnd at this very time, over in the hotel at Sintaluta, a grain grower\r\nof great ability and discernment was warning an interested group of\r\nfarmers against the dangers of over-confidence.\r\n\r\n\"At present we are but pygmies attacking giants,\" declared E. A.\r\nPartridge.  \"Giants may compete with giants, pygmies with pygmies, but\r\npygmies with giants, never.  We are not denizens of a hamlet but\r\ncitizens of a world and we are facing the interlocking financial,\r\ncommercial and industrial interests of a thousand million people.  If\r\nwe are to create a fighting force by co-operation of the workers to\r\nmeet the giants created by the commercial co-operation of the owners,\r\nwe have scarcely started.  If we seek permanent improvement in our\r\nfinancial position and thereby an increase of comfort, opportunity and\r\nsense of security in our lives and the lives of our families, the fight\r\nwill be long and hard.\r\n\r\n\"And we are going to need every man we can muster.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix--Par. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\"THAT MAN PARTRIDGE!\"\r\n\r\nAny man can work when every stroke of his hand brings down the fruit\r\nrattling from the tree to the ground; but to labor in season and out of\r\nseason, under every discouragement, by the power of faith . . . that\r\nrequires a heroism which is transcendent.  And no man, I think, ever\r\nputs the plow into the furrow and does not look back, and sows good\r\nseed therein, that a harvest does not follow.--_Henry Ward Beecher_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a handy place to live, that little tar-paper shanty around which\r\nthe prairie wind whooed and whiffed with such disdain.  So small was it\r\nthat it was possible to wash oneself, dress oneself and get breakfast\r\nwithout getting out of bed.  On the wall was a shelf which did duty as\r\na table.  There were also a little box stove and some odds and ends.\r\nWhen the roof leaked, which was every time it rained, it was necessary\r\nto put pans on the bed to catch the drip.\r\n\r\nBut it was better than the tent in which E. A. Partridge and his\r\nbrother slept through their first star-strewn winter nights on the open\r\nprairie--more pretentious than the tent and assuredly not so cold.  The\r\ntwo boys were proud of it, even though they were fresh from\r\ncivilization--from Simcoe County, Ontario, where holly-hocks topped the\r\nfences of old-fashioned flower gardens in summer and the houses had\r\nshingles on top to keep out the weather, and where there were no\r\ncoyotes to howl lonesomely at night, where--Well, never mind.  Those\r\nhouses belonged to other people; the shanty was theirs.  All around\r\nstretched acres and acres of snow; but there was land under that\r\nsnow--rich, new land--and that was theirs, too, by right of\r\nhomesteading.\r\n\r\nIt was about Christmas time in 1883 when E. A. Partridge was\r\ntwenty-one.  The place was near Sintaluta, District of Assiniboia,\r\nNorth-West Territories, and homesteading there in the days before the\r\nRebellion was no feather bed for those who tackled it.  A piece of\r\nactual money was a thing to take out and look at every little while, to\r\nshow to one's friends and talk about.\r\n\r\nSeason after season the half starved agricultural pathfinders lost\r\ntheir hard-earned crops by drouth and what was not burned out by the\r\nsun was eaten by ubiquitous gophers.  The drouth was due, no doubt, to\r\nthe frequent prairie fires which swept the country; these found birth\r\nin the camp-fire coals left by ignorant or careless settlers on their\r\nway in.  Under the rays of the summer sun the blackened ground became\r\nso hot that from it ascended a column of scorching air which interfered\r\nwith the condensation of vapor preceding the falling of rain.  Clouds\r\nwould bank up above the prairie horizon, eagerly watched by anxious\r\nhomesteaders; but over the burned area the clouds seemed to thin out\r\nwithout a drop falling upon the parching crops.\r\n\r\nForty-three acres, sown to wheat, was the first crop which the\r\nPartridge brothers put in.  The total yield was seven bushels, obtained\r\nfrom around the edges of a slough!\r\n\r\nOne by one discouraged settlers gathered together their few belongings\r\nand sought fresh trails.  Lone men trudged by, pack on back, silent and\r\ngrim.  Swearing at his horses, wheels squealing for axle-grease, tin\r\npans rattling and flashing in the hot morning sun, a settler with a\r\nfamily stopped one day to ask questions of the two young men.  He was\r\non his way--somewhere--no place in particular.\r\n\r\n\"I tell ye, boys, this country ain't no place fer a white man,\" he\r\nvolunteered.  \"When y'ain't freezin' ye're burnin' up, an' that's what\r\nhappens in hell!\"  He spat a stream of tobacco juice over the wagon\r\nwheel and clawed his beard, his brown face twisted quizzically.  \"God\r\nA'mighty ain't nowheres near here!  He didn't come this fur\r\nWest--stopped down to Rat Portage![1]  Well, anyways, good luck to ye\r\nboth; but ef ye don't git it, young fellers, don't ye go blamin' me, by\r\nJupiter!\"  He cracked his whip.  \"Come up out o' that, ye God-forsaken\r\nold skates!\"  And, mud-caked wheels screeching, tin pans banging and\r\nglaring, he jolted back to the trail that led away in distance to No\r\nPlace In Particular.\r\n\r\nBut along with some others who confessed to being poor walkers, the\r\nPartridge boys stuck right where they were.  They set about the\r\nbuilding of a more permanent and comfortable shack--a sod house this\r\ntime.  It took more than seven thousand sods, one foot by three, three\r\ninches thick; but when it was finished it was a precocious raindrop or\r\na mendacious wind that could find its way in.\r\n\r\nAbout thirteen miles distant was a little mud schoolhouse, and one day\r\nE. A. Partridge was asked to go over and teach in it.  It was known\r\nthat back East, besides working on his father's farm, he had taught\r\nschool for awhile.  Learning was a truant for the younger generation on\r\nthe prairies at that time, there being only a few private schools\r\nscattered here and there.  Though it was not much of an opportunity for\r\nanything but something to do, the offer was accepted, and every\r\nmorning, after sucking a couple of eggs for a breakfast, E. A.\r\nPartridge took to loping across the prairie on a \"Shag\" pony.\r\n\r\nBut the little school put an idea into his head.  He wondered if it\r\nmight be worth while starting a private school of his own, and in 1885\r\nhe thought the Broadview locality offered profitable prospects.  He\r\ndecided to go down there and look over the situation.\r\n\r\nBy this time the occupants of the sod house numbered four--three\r\nPartridge brothers and a friend.  The problem of fitting out the\r\nschool-teacher for his Broadview trip so that he would create the\r\nnecessary impression among strangers was one which called for\r\ncorrugated brows.  The solution of it was not to be found in any of the\r\nteacher's few text-books; it quite upset Euclid's idea that things\r\nwhich were equal to the same thing were equal to one another--when it\r\ncame to finding enough parts to make a respectable whole!  For among\r\nthe four bachelors was not one whole suit of clothes sufficiently\r\npresentable for social events.  Everything was rough and ready in those\r\ndays and in spite of the hardships the friendly pioneer settlers had\r\nsome good times together; but the sod house quartette had never been\r\nseen at any of these gatherings--not all four at one time!  Three of\r\nthem were always so busy with this or that work that they had to stay\r\nhome, you know; it would have been embarrassing to admit that it was\r\nonly by pooling their clothes they could take turns in exhibiting a\r\nneighborly spirit.  As it was, there was often a secret fear of\r\nexhibiting even more--an anxiety which led the visitor to keep the wall\r\nat his back like a man expecting general excitement to break loose at\r\nany moment!\r\n\r\nOn reaching Broadview the prospects for the new school looked bright,\r\nso the hopeful pedagogue sent back word to the sod house to this effect.\r\n\r\n\"And don't you fellows forget to send my linen,\" he wrote jokingly.\r\n\"Make the trunk heavy, too.  I don't know how long it will have to\r\nrepresent my credit!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the trunk arrived it was so heavy that it took two men to carry it\r\ninto the hotel.  When in the secrecy of his own room E. A. Partridge\r\nventured to look inside he found his few books, a pair of \"jumper\"\r\nsocks--and a lot of stones!  Also there was an old duster with a piece\r\nof paper pinned to it, advising: \"Here's your linen!\"\r\n\r\nThe Broadview school did not last long for the reason that the second\r\nNorth-West Rebellion broke out that year and the teacher joined the\r\nYorkton Rangers.  Fifty cents a day and grub was an alluring prospect;\r\nmany a poor homesteader would have joined the ranks on active service\r\nfor the grub alone, especially when the time of his absence was being\r\nallowed by the Government to apply on the term set for homestead duties\r\nbefore he could come into full possession of his land.  Many farmers\r\nearned money, also, teaming supplies from the railway north to\r\nBattleford and Prince Albert.\r\n\r\nIn common with his fellow grain growers, the five years that followed\r\nwere years of continuous struggle for E. A. Partridge.  The railway\r\ncame and the country commenced to settle quickly.  The days of prairie\r\nfires that ran amuck gave way to thriving crops; but at thirty and\r\nforty cents per bushel the thriving of those who sowed them was another\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThis man with the snappy blue eyes and caustic tongue was among the\r\nfirst to foresee \"the rising colossus,\" the shadow of which was\r\ncreeping slowly across the farmer's path, and he watched the \"brewing\r\nmenace\" with growing concern.  With every ounce of his tremendous\r\nenergy he resented the encroachment of Capital upon the liberties of\r\nLabor.  Being of the people and temperamentally a democrat, he had a\r\ngreat yearning for the reorganization of society in the general\r\ninterest.  His championship in this direction earned him the reputation\r\nin some quarters of being full of \"fads,\" a visionary.  But his\r\nneighbors, who had toiled and suffered beside him through the years,\r\nknew \"Ed.\" Partridge, man to man, and held him in high regard; they\r\nadmired him for his human qualities, respected him for his abilities,\r\nand wondered at his theories.  On occasion they, too, shook their heads\r\ndoubtfully.  They could not know the big part in their emancipation\r\nwhich this friend and neighbor of theirs was destined to play through\r\nmany days of crisis.  Not yet had the talley begun.\r\n\r\nBut events even now slowly were shaping.  With the winning of their\r\nfirst clash the farmers' movement was achieving momentum.  In the\r\nlatter part of December, 1902, down in the town of Virden, Manitoba, a\r\ncommittee was appointed at a meeting of the Virden Agricultural\r\nSociety, to arrange a district meeting for the purpose of organizing\r\nthe first Grain Growers' Association in Manitoba.  As soon as the date\r\nwas set J. W. Scallion wrote to W. R. Motherwell, urgently asking him\r\nto assist in the organization.  Although roads and weather were rough,\r\nthe President of the Territorial Grain Growers' Association at\r\nconsiderable inconvenience went down to Virden, taking with him Matt.\r\nSnow and copies of the constitution and by-laws upon which the\r\nTerritorial Association was founded, With this assistance a strong\r\nlocal association was formed at Virden on January 9th, 1903, with\r\ncapable officers[2] and a first-year membership of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nThe same difficulties that faced the farmers farther West were being\r\nexperienced in Manitoba and the newspapers were full of protesting\r\nletters from country points.  As President of the Virden Grain Growers'\r\nAssociation, J. W. Scallion wrote letters to every place where\r\ncomplaints were being voiced and urged organization.  At every\r\nopportunity it was advocated through the press that from the eastern\r\nboundary of Manitoba to the Rocky Mountains the farmers should organize\r\nthemselves for self-defence against oppression, present or possible, by\r\n\"the interests.\"  In about six weeks over fifteen local associations\r\nhad been formed in Manitoba and Virden began calling for a Provincial\r\nassociation.  Accordingly, on March 3rd and 4th, 1903, the Manitoba\r\ngrain growers held their first convention at Brandon with one hundred\r\ndelegates present, representing twenty-six local associations.  Great\r\nenthusiasm marked the event and the officers[3] chosen were all men of\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nThe members of the parent organization watched the rapid expansion on\r\nall sides with sparkling eyes.  Their own second annual convention at\r\nIndian Head revealed considerable progress and the promise of greater\r\nthings to come.  On the invitation of the delegates from the Regina\r\ndistrict it was decided to hold the third annual convention at the\r\ncapital and the rousing gathering which met there in due course was\r\nproductive of such stimulus and publicity that its effect was felt long\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nAt every convention the farmers found some additional weak spot in the\r\nGrain Act and suggested remedial legislation.  Records are lacking to\r\nshow in what order the various changes came; but step by step the\r\nfarmers were gaining their rights.  It all seemed so wonderful--to get\r\ntogether thus and frame requests of the Government at Ottawa, to find\r\ntheir very wording incorporated in the Act.  The farmers scarcely had\r\ndared to think of such a thing before.  To them the ear of a government\r\nwas a delicate organism beyond reach, attuned to the acoustics of High\r\nPlaces only; that it was an ear to hear, an ear to the ground to catch\r\nthe voice of the people was a discovery.  At any rate when W. R.\r\nMotherwell and J. B. Gillespie, of the Territories, D. W. McCuaig and\r\nR. C. Henders, of Manitoba, went to Ottawa for the first time they were\r\nreceived with every consideration and many of their requests on behalf\r\nof the farmers granted.\r\n\r\nWith such recognition and the recurring evidence of advantageous\r\nresults the jeering grins of a certain section of the onlooking public\r\nbegan to sober down to a less disrespectful mien.  Those who talked\r\nglibly at first of the other farmers' organizations which they had seen\r\ngo to pieces became less free with their forebodings.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the farmers began to press for something more than the proper\r\ndistribution of cars and the freedom of shipment.  They were\r\ndissatisfied with the grading system and the re-inspection machinery.\r\nSome of them claimed that the grading system did not classify wheat\r\naccording to its milling value.  Some wanted a change in the\r\nGovernment's staff at the office of the Chief Grain Inspector where the\r\nofficial grading was done.  Some wanted a sample market; some didn't.\r\nThe farmers were about evenly divided.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture for the Territories commissioned\r\nProfessor Robert Harcourt, Chemist of the Ontario Agricultural College,\r\nto conduct tests as to the comparative values of the different grades\r\nof wheat.  E. A. Partridge, of Sintaluta, and A. A. Perley, of\r\nWolseley, undertook to secure eight-bushel samples of the various\r\ngrades from their districts.  These were carefully sacked and shipped\r\nto the Chief Grain Inspector at Winnipeg, where he graded them and\r\nforwarded them to Professor Harcourt, sealed in such a way that any\r\ntampering with the shipment would be detected readily.\r\n\r\nThese samples were all of 1903 crop.  There had been a bad snowstorm in\r\nSeptember of that year and much wheat had been standing in stook.  The\r\nfarmers believed that the grain was not frozen or injured in any way\r\nand that they were defrauded to some extent in the grading of their\r\nwheat.  The samples represented all grades from \"No. 1 Hard\" to \"Feed.\"\r\nThey were milled with exceptional care to prevent mixing of the various\r\nlots and the flours obtained were put through three different baking\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion reached was that there did not appear to be much\r\ndifference in the value of the different grades of wheat.  Even the\r\n\"Feed\" sample proved by no means useless for bread-making purposes,\r\neither in yield or quality; the only thing that rendered it less\r\navailable for bakers' use was its darker color.  All who saw the loaves\r\nwere surprised at the quality of this bread.\r\n\r\nThe tests on these 1903 samples confirmed the farmers in their opinion\r\nthat on 1903 wheat the spread in price between No. 1 Hard and No. 4 was\r\nnot in harmony with the milling quality.  From No. 1 Hard the amount of\r\nflour obtained was 70.8 per cent. as against 68 per cent. from the No.\r\n4 grade.  The large percentage of stook-frozen grain that went into the\r\nlower grades because it was technically debarred from the higher ones\r\nno doubt raised the milling value, it was thought, of all the grades\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture for the Territories therefore decided to\r\nrepeat the tests with 1904 wheat.  The samples with which Professor\r\nHarcourt was furnished represented the grain just as it was sold by the\r\nfarmer and graded either at the elevator or by the Chief Grain\r\nInspector; it was not a composite sample of the commercial grades.  The\r\nsecond tests practically confirmed the work done the previous year.\r\nThe milling, chemical and baking tests failed to show very wide\r\ndifferences in the composition and milling value of the grades\r\nsubmitted.  The conclusion reached was that the difference in\r\ncomposition and milling value was nearly as great between samples of\r\nany one grade as between the various grades.\r\n\r\nThe farmers began to feel that it would be a good thing to have a\r\nrepresentative at Winnipeg to watch the grading of their cars and to\r\nlook after their interests generally.  The Department of Agriculture\r\nfor the Territories was asked by the Sintaluta grain growers to appoint\r\na man and W. H. Gaddes was commissioned to act for two weeks.  Then the\r\nfarmers began to wonder if they could not send down a man of their own;\r\nat one of their meetings the question was put and those present\r\nsubscribed five dollars apiece for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that on the 7th of January, 1905, there stepped from\r\nthe train at the C. P. R. depot in Winnipeg a man who looked no\r\ndifferent from any one of a dozen other farmers who daily reached the\r\ncity, tanned of cheek and bright of eye.  But his business in town was\r\nof a very special nature.  In his pocket was a hundred dollars and the\r\ngrip in his hand was packed for a month's stay.\r\n\r\nIt was a month of \"cold shoulders\" and patronizing manners for E. A.\r\nPartridge.  No band music was played in his honor, no festive board was\r\nspread, nor was he taken around and shown the sights of the city.  On\r\nthe contrary, he was made to feel like a spy in the camp of an enemy;\r\nfor he found himself entirely without status, the grain dealers\r\nrecognizing him merely as a farmers' representative, whatever that was.\r\nEven at the office of the Chief Grain Inspector he was looked upon as a\r\nman who was meddling with something which he wasn't supposed to know\r\nanything about.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Chief Inspector himself gave him information at times\r\nand there were one or two others who took the trouble to explain some\r\nthings about which he asked questions.  Among the latter was a grain\r\nman by the name of Tom Coulter.  For the most part, however, the\r\npresence of the \"farmers' representative\" at Winnipeg was looked upon\r\nas a joke; so that information as to the grain business became for him\r\nlargely a still hunt.  He visited offices, listened to how interviews\r\nwere conducted over the telephone and picked up whatever loose ends he\r\ncould find to follow up.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that fellow, anyway?\" asked a grain man who had just got back\r\nto the city.  He jerked his thumb over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, him!\" laughed his partner as he saw who was indicated.  \"Only that\r\ngazabo from Sintaluta who's been nosing around lately.  Some hayseeds\r\nout the line sent him down here to learn the grain business.  They\r\nbelieve that all wheat's No. 1 Hard, all grain buyers are thieves, and\r\nthat hell's to be divided equally between the railways and the milling\r\ncompanies!\"\r\n\r\n\"So that's the guy, eh?--that's that man Partridge!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The new name of Rat Portage is Kenora (Ontario).\r\n\r\n[2] See Appendix--Par. 2.\r\n\r\n[3] See Appendix--Par. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\"THE HOUSE WITH THE CLOSED SHUTTERS\"\r\n\r\nKnock, knock, knock!  Who's there, i' the name of Beelzebub?  Here's a\r\nfarmer . . .--_Macbeth_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen wheat ceased to be grown for local needs and overflowed upon the\r\nmarkets of the world, becoming a factor in finance, arenas where its\r\ndestiny was decided were established in the large centres of trade.  In\r\nthese basins of commerce the never-ending flow concentrated and wheeled\r\nfor a short space before in re-directed currents it rolled on its way\r\nto ocean ports.  Here, according to the novelists, frantic men were\r\nsucked into the golden eddies, their cries strangled and their fate\r\nforgotten even as they were engulfed by the Leviathan with which they\r\nadventured; or they emerged with eyes bloodshot, voices gone and\r\nclothes torn, successful speculators of a day.  Perhaps the general\r\nreader is more familiar with these mad scenes of \"The Pit,\" as the\r\ntrading floor is called, than with the steadily turning marketing\r\nmachinery of which they are but a penumbra.\r\n\r\nThe modern grain exchange is much more than a mere roulette wheel for\r\nthe speculator.  Its real purpose is to provide a centre for the\r\nlegitimate trader.  It is a great information bureau of world\r\nhappenings where every item of news concerning the wheat in any way is\r\ngathered and classified--drouth, rain, frost, rust, locusts, hail,\r\nHessian fly, monsoon or chinch bug.  In every corner of the earth where\r\nthe wheat streams take their rise, from green blade to brown head the\r\nprogress of the crop is recorded and the prospects forecasted--on the\r\nsteppes of Russia, the pampas of the Argentine, the valley of the San\r\nJoaquin, the prairies of Western Canada and the Dakotas, the fields of\r\nIndia, Iowa, Illinois and Kansas.  Good news, bad news, the movements\r\nof ships, the prices on the corn exchanges of London and Liverpool, at\r\nChicago, on the bourses of Paris, Antwerp and Amsterdam--all are\r\nlisted.  With such a Timepiece of International Exchange ticking out\r\nthe doings of nations, both buyer and seller can know what prices will\r\ngovern their dealings.  In office or farmhouse an ear to a telephone is\r\nall that is necessary.\r\n\r\nA grain exchange, then, is the market-place where grain dealers meet to\r\nsecure information and maintain regulations for the prompt performance\r\nof contracts.  The exchange organization does not deal in grain, but\r\nhas for its sole purpose the protection of those who do and the\r\nfacilitating of transactions; in other words, it is on the ground to\r\nsee that the grain trade is carried on in an honest and capable manner\r\nand to punish offenders against proper business ethics and established\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nIts membership is composed of grain dealers doing business in the\r\nexchange's territory--milling companies, exporting companies, line\r\nelevator companies as well as independent dealers and \"commission men.\"\r\nBesides seeking a supply of wheat to keep their mills busy for the\r\nseason, the milling companies sell wheat.  It is the business of the\r\nexporters to make shipment to other countries.  Wheat is sold to\r\nexporters and millers by the elevator companies, who are interested in\r\nrunning as much grain as possible through their elevators at country\r\npoints.  The chief business of independent dealers is to handle wheat\r\nthat stands \"on track,\" ready for shipment, either buying outright from\r\nthe farmer or handling it for him on a commission basis.\r\n\r\nThe \"commission man\" is in an especially good position to do a\r\nclean-cut business.  He assumes no burden of large capital investment\r\nand operating expense, as do the elevator companies.  His chief need is\r\na line of credit at a bank and from this he pays advances to his\r\nclients, his security being the bills of lading of wheat consigned to\r\nhim.  He does not need to buy or sell on his own account and, unlike\r\nthe exporter, he does not have to risk changes in freight rates or in\r\nprices or make deliveries by given dates.  As for the satisfactory\r\nmilling quality of the crop--that is something for the miller to worry\r\nover.  In order to do business it is necessary only for the commission\r\nman to be a member of the exchange and to obey its rules.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Winnipeg has been known as the greatest primary wheat\r\nmarket in the world.  That means that a greater volume of new wheat,\r\ndirect from the producer, passes through the Winnipeg market than\r\nanywhere else, not even excepting Chicago where the first grain\r\nexchange to reach international development was established in 1848.\r\nThe Winnipeg market is fed by the vast wheat area of Western Canada and\r\nfrequently between two and three million bushels of wheat go through\r\nWinnipeg in a single day.  During the rush season sixty or seventy cars\r\nof wheat leave Winnipeg for the East every twenty minutes of every\r\ntwenty-four hours.  The freight boats on the lakes load 460,000 bushels\r\nin three-and-a-half hours.[1]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that nowhere else in the world is a great\r\npublic grain market like the Winnipeg market found located four hundred\r\nmiles away from the storage point where grain dealt in is kept for sale\r\ndelivery.  Geographically Fort William and Port Arthur at the head of\r\nthe great lakes water route would provide the natural delivery point\r\nfor Western grain which has been routed eastward[2] and there the\r\nlocation of the exchange might be looked for logically.  It so happens,\r\nhowever, that the eastern edge of the vast grain fields lies four\r\nhundred miles west of the twin harbors, the country between not being\r\nadapted for farming, and to avoid the delay of mail transit and to\r\noperate the trading effectively it was necessary to locate the exchange\r\nat Winnipeg, the great metropolitan railway centre where the incoming\r\ngrain concentrated.\r\n\r\nIn Western Canada the grain is stored in bulk by grades, thereby\r\ncheapening handling cost.  Unlike most countries--which sell grain on\r\nsample--Western Canadian grain has been sold by grade.  The inspection\r\nand grading of wheat, therefore, is a very important factor in the\r\ngrain trade of Canada and is in full charge of Dominion Government\r\nofficials.  Upon their verdict depends the price per bushel which will\r\nbe paid for any shipment of grain, market quotations varying for\r\ndifferent grades; whether stored, sold at home or sold abroad their\r\ncertificate of grade brands that particular wheat throughout.  The huge\r\nriver of grain flows in upon them unceasingly; at times the inspectors\r\nhave to work at top speed to avoid being engulfed.  The variety of\r\nNature's response to the growing conditions in changing seasons must\r\nnot confuse them from year to year; but with sharpened senses and sound\r\njudgment they must steer a sure course through the multiplicity of\r\ngrades and grade subdivisions.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughness of the system adopted by the Grain Inspection\r\nDepartment is shown by description of the work done at Winnipeg.\r\nOffices and staffs in charge of deputy inspectors are maintained in the\r\ndifferent railway yards.  They work in shifts night and day; for during\r\nthe mad seventy-or-so days in which the Western crop stampedes for the\r\nlakefront there is no let-up to the in-rolling wheat-bins which come\r\nswaying and grinding in over the rails like beads on a string--the\r\nendless rosary of harvest thanksgiving.  Wheat samples must be obtained\r\nfrom each car and no train can be moved until a placard has been placed\r\nat the end of it, reading: \"Grain Inspectors have finished this train.\"\r\nA fifty-car train can be sampled in about an hour and a half, which is\r\ncomfortable time for a change of engines and crews.\r\n\r\nThe sampling gangs work with all the precision of gun crews--each man\r\nwith a particular thing to do.  One goes down the train, opening car\r\ndoors and leaving an empty sample bag in each car.  Running up a short\r\nladder, the sampler climbs over the top of the inner door, which\r\nextends above the \"load line\"; the standard sampler which he uses is a\r\ncylindrical brass rod, so constructed that when it is \"stabbed\" to the\r\nbottom of the car the grain which fills it is a correct sample of wheat\r\nat every depth.  Seven such samples are procured from different\r\nsections of the car, and the track foreman, standing on a ladder,\r\nwatches these poured onto a cloth with an eye to detecting evidence of\r\n\"plugging\" with an inferior quality of grain; these seven samples\r\nhaving been mixed thoroughly, a canvas bag is filled from the result\r\nand the two-and-one-half pounds which it will hold become the official\r\nsample.  The rest of the mixture is dumped back and the car resealed.\r\n\r\nThe foreman has filled out a sample ticket with car number, date, load\r\nline, initials of sampler and any other notations necessary--such as\r\nleakages, etc.  His own name is stamped on the back of the ticket,\r\nwhich goes into the sample sack.  Copies of the way bills with full\r\ninformation as to all cars, shipping points, consignees or advisees and\r\ndestinations are obtained from the railway yard office and these,\r\ntogether with the samples, are sent twice a day to the Chief Grain\r\nInspector's office at the Grain Exchange.\r\n\r\nHere the samples are inspected and graded in a room with special\r\nlighting facilities.  The grading is done only in broad daylight.  The\r\nquality of the grain, its condition and the admixtures are determined\r\nrespectively by judgment of hand and eye, by elaborate mechanical\r\nmoisture tests and by a sieving and weighing process.  The whole sample\r\nis examined closely for color, plumpness, weight, etc., in order to fix\r\nits grade as No. 1 Hard, No. 1 Northern, 2 Northern, 3 Northern; 1 Hard\r\nand 1 Northern must weigh at least sixty pounds, 2 Northern fifty-eight\r\npounds, and so on.  Grades below these are set by the Grain Standards\r\nBoard.  Damp or wet grain is marked \"No Grade,\" which means that it is\r\nconsidered unfit for storing and therefore has a lower market value.\r\nGrain which is heated or bin-burnt is \"condemned.\"  If it is unsound,\r\nmusty, dirty, smutty, sprouted or badly mixed with other grain, etc.,\r\nit is \"rejected.\"  Grain which, because of weather or other conditions,\r\ncannot be included in the grades provided by statute is given a\r\n\"commercial grade.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that here is work requiring great nicety of\r\njudgment and that long experience is necessary to enable the grader to\r\nreach his decisions quickly and accurately.  When the grading is\r\ncompleted the sample is placed in a small tin box and filed\r\nsystematically; it is supposed to remain thus stored until there is no\r\nlonger the possibility of a demand for re-inspection and finally the\r\nsamples are sacked and sold to the miller with the highest bid, the\r\nmoney being paid to the Dominion Government.\r\n\r\nGrade certificates, bearing the Chief Grain Inspector's signature, are\r\nissued for each shipment and sent at once to the elevator company,\r\nmiller or commission agent to whom the car is consigned.  These grade\r\ncertificates, together with the weight certificate and the bill of\r\nlading, make the grain negotiable on the market; the dealer does not\r\nsee the actual grain, merely handling these papers.\r\n\r\nIf dissatisfaction with grade or dockage arises, the owner of the grain\r\nor his agent can obtain re-inspection at the office of the Chief Grain\r\nInspector free of charge, and, if still dissatisfied, appeal can be\r\nmade to the Survey Board.  This is a board of twelve men; the governing\r\nrules and regulations are established by the Grain Commission.  Six\r\nmembers are recommended by the Winnipeg Board of Trade and two each by\r\nthe Minister of Agriculture in each of the three prairie provinces.[3]\r\nThe verdict of the Survey Board is final.\r\n\r\nNow, back in 1905 the machinery for moving the crop upon its way was\r\nlittle understood by the average Western Canadian farmer.  The wheels\r\nwent around, gave a click and away went his wheat; but in approaching\r\nit all with the idea of understanding everything he was in the position\r\nof the small boy examining the works of a watch to see how it told the\r\ntime.  He felt that he ought to understand what went on down at\r\nWinnipeg; for of course where there were so many rules and regulations\r\nto be broken there must be \"funny work.\"  It was the natural suspicion\r\nof the man who lived much to himself in the quiet spaces, who could not\r\nbelieve that grain dealers could be honest and build palatial\r\nresidences in Winnipeg while his own toil in producing the grain was\r\nrewarded with a living only.  It looked as if the roost was being\r\nrobbed and with his newborn initiative he wanted to find out how it was\r\ndone and who was doing it.\r\n\r\nThe satisfactory manner in which things are conducted in the grain\r\ntrade to-day is the result of long experience and gradual improvement\r\nof conditions.  It must be remembered that in the earlier days the\r\ntrade was not so well organized for efficiency and in 1905 when E. A.\r\nPartridge began to probe for \"plugging\" he had a big job on his hands,\r\nespecially in view of the fact that he was treated for the most part as\r\na meddler who was not entitled to reliable information.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of reaching a conclusion--one by approaching it\r\nlogically on facts laid down; the other by jumping to it across a\r\nyawning lack of detail.  At the end of his month of investigation the\r\nfarmer's scout had a regular rag-bag of material out of which to\r\nfashion a patchwork report.  A grain man might have condemned it as a\r\n\"crazy quilt\" because bits of high color obtruded inharmoniously.  But\r\nif here and there an end was short or a bit of information on the bias,\r\nit was because the \"Farmers' Representative\" had not been treated with\r\nsufficient frankness.  He had to make the best of the materials allowed\r\nhim and his natural tendency to bright-colored metaphor may have been\r\nquickened.  He hit out straight from the shoulder in all sincerity at\r\nconditions as they appeared to him.\r\n\r\nHe thought he saw five companies controlling the exporting business,\r\nand also their margin of profit, so that they were able to keep out\r\nsmaller dealers who might have the temerity and the necessary capital\r\nto try exporting on their own account.  He saw the smaller dealers in\r\nturn stem-winding their prices by those of the exporters, controlling\r\nthe prices paid for street and track wheat throughout the country;\r\nthereby, he reasoned, it became possible to set special prices at any\r\ngiven point by the simple expedient of wiring the necessary\r\ninstructions to the operator at that point to pinch independent\r\ncompetition.  He saw elevator companies cutting their charges at\r\ncertain points to kill off competition from \"farmers' elevators\" which\r\nsold to independent dealers.  All this he was sure he saw.\r\n\r\nThe sampling appeared to be carried on in a systematic and satisfactory\r\nmanner.  The grading, too, appeared to be uniform enough as regarded\r\nthe standard grades; but in the item of color there seemed just cause\r\nfor complaint.  Lack of color, a trifling number of imperfectly formed\r\nkernels or the suspicion of a wrinkle on the bran apparently doomed a\r\nsample to low grade no matter how heavy and flinty the wheat might be.\r\n\r\nThis seemed scarcely fair to Partridge, who bore in mind that the sunny\r\nseasons of past years had been succeeded by cloudier ones, the dry\r\nautumns by wet ones and that with stacking discontinued and much of the\r\nfarmers' wheat left long in stock, bleaching was bound to follow.  So\r\nthat if the Chief Grain Inspector were a \"crank on color,\" he should\r\nremember that beauty was only skin deep.\r\n\r\nThe fracture and microscopic and weighing tests seemed to be the only\r\nreasonable tests which could be applied quickly; the milling test was\r\nthe only one which was absolutely correct.  Any rapid eye test which\r\npretended to determine whether there was sixty-one per cent. or\r\nfifty-nine per cent. of Red Fife wheat in a given sample struck the\r\nFarmers' Representative as farcical; yet this was sufficient to make\r\nthe difference of a grade and sometimes a difference of seven cents per\r\nbushel in the price obtained.\r\n\r\nThe whim of the Inspector likewise decided how many lean berries in a\r\nplump sample would disqualify it for \"plump\" classification and how\r\nmany mature or defective berries among sound wheat, would disqualify it\r\nfrom being classed as \"sound.\"  With a single concocted sample as a\r\nbasis of judgment Partridge considered that the grading of the lower\r\ngrades often was very unjust to the producer, especially to the owners\r\nof plump frosted wheat; the process of concocting the basic sample was\r\nvery interesting; but the result was \"a nightmare.\"\r\n\r\nW. H. Gaddes, who had preceded him to Winnipeg, agreed with him in\r\nthis.  Also, Mr. Gaddes denounced the Survey Board at that time as\r\nunsatisfactory in its composition, open to suspicion in its findings\r\nand in practice--so far as outsiders' wheat was concerned--simply a\r\nmachine to register confirmation of the Inspector's previous grading.\r\n\r\nIt was Partridge's belief that \"many a fraud perpetrated in a line\r\nelevator\" was added to the \"iniquities\" of the Inspector, in whose\r\npersonal integrity he had every confidence.  For this reason he was\r\ninclined to be lenient with the hard-working and conscientious\r\nofficials of the Government.  Nevertheless, it appeared wise that a\r\nfarmers' special agent be maintained permanently at Winnipeg to\r\nsafeguard the interests of the farmers, especially if certain powers\r\nwere allotted to him under the Inspection Act.\r\n\r\nIn making his report to the Territorial Grain Growers' Association\r\nPartridge went into the whole situation as he saw it and particularly\r\nwas he outspoken in regard to \"that House with the Closed Shutters,\" as\r\nhe called the Winnipeg Grain and Produce Exchange.  In fact, his gas\r\nattack upon the Exchange was ablaze with the fires of hostility.\r\n\r\nAnd for the use of his reckless language Partridge was to be called to\r\naccount in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although only about ten per cent. of the arable area in Western\r\nCanada is under cultivation there are already 3,500 country elevators.\r\nTerminal elevators at the head of the lakes with a storage capacity of\r\nforty-four million bushels and interior Government terminals with ten\r\nand one-half million bushels capacity are overflowing already.  Wheat\r\nexports of Canada have increased from 2,284,702 bushels in 1867 to\r\n157,745,469 bushels in 1916.  Per capita Canada has more railway\r\nmileage than any country in the world.\r\n\r\n[2] In early days nearly all grain was routed eastward via Winnipeg;\r\nbut with the development of the grain trade and the opening of the\r\nPanama Canal some Western Canadian grain travels west and south.\r\nFacilities for inspection and grading have been established at Calgary,\r\nSuperior, Duluth, Saskatoon, Moose Jaw, Medicine Hat and Vancouver.\r\n\r\n[3] In 1905 three members of the Survey Board were recommended by the\r\nWinnipeg Board of Trade and three each by the respective Departments of\r\nAgriculture in the three Prairie Provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nON A CARD IN THE WINDOW OF WILSON'S OLD STORE\r\n\r\n            . . . Is it vain to hope\r\n  The sons of such a land will climb and grope\r\n  Along the undiscovered ways of life,\r\n  And neither seek nor be found shunning strife,\r\n  But ever, beckoned by a high ideal,\r\n  Press onward, upward, till they make it real;\r\n  With feet sure planted on their native sod,\r\n  And will and aspirations linked with God?\r\n          --Robert J. C. Stead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeas grow.  The particular idea which now began to occupy the thoughts\r\nof E. A. Partridge to the exclusion of everything else was a big idea\r\nto begin with; but it kept on growing so rapidly that it soon became an\r\nobsession.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn't the farmers themselves form a company to undertake the\r\nmarketing of their own wheat?  That was the idea.  If a thousand\r\nfarmers got together in control of ten million bushels of wheat and\r\nsold through a single accredited agency, they would be in the same\r\nposition exactly as a single person who owned ten million bushels.  If\r\nthe owner of ten thousand bushels was able to make a better bargain\r\nthan the owner of one thousand, what about the owner of ten million\r\nbushels?\r\n\r\n\"Would the owner of ten million bushels peddle his wheat by the\r\nwagonload at the local shipping point or by the carload in Winnipeg?\"\r\nmused Partridge.  \"Would he pay one hundred thousand dollars to a\r\ncommission man to sell his wheat, with perhaps a nice rake-off to an\r\nexporter, who turns it over at a profit by selling it to a British\r\ndealer, who blends it and makes a good living by selling the blend to a\r\nBritish miller?\"\r\n\r\nHis pencil travelled swiftly on the back of an envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Would he pay one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars to the line\r\nelevator and stand a dockage of one hundred thousand bushels in\r\naddition?  Would he pay the terminal elevator seventy-five thousand\r\ndollars' worth of screenings?  Would he pay two and one-half million\r\ndollars for transportation when 'by a little method known to large\r\nexporters' he could save one and a quarter million dollars out of this\r\nitem?\r\n\r\n\"You just bet he wouldn't!\" concluded this man Partridge.  \"And\r\nsupposing we had ten thousand farmers in one company and each farmer\r\nproduced, on an average, five thousand bushels of wheat--that would put\r\nthe company in control of the sale of _fifty_ million bushels, not ten!\r\nWhy, there's the answer to the whole blame thing--so simple we've been\r\nstepping right over it!\"\r\n\r\nPools, mergers, combines, trusts and monopolies were but various forms\r\nof the same co-operative principle acting within narrow limits to the\r\nbenefit of the co-operatives and the prejudices of the outsiders.  The\r\nremedy lay not in legislative penalties against co-operation but in the\r\npractice of co-operation on a large scale by the people.  That would\r\nprovide the most powerful weapon of defence against financial\r\nbuccaneering.  Universally employed, it would bring about an industrial\r\nmillennium!\r\n\r\nBut this was dreaming, of course.  None knew better than E. A.\r\nPartridge that if even a small part of it was to come true, there lay\r\nimmediately ahead a great educational campaign.  Ignorance and\r\nsuspicion would require to be routed.  It would be difficult to\r\nconvince some farmers that his motives were unselfish.  Others would be\r\nopposed to the idea of a farmers' trading company in the belief that it\r\nwould wreck the Association.  \"We must keep our organization\r\nnon-partizan, non-political and non-trading\" had been the slogan from\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted by the difficulties which loomed in the foreground,\r\nPartridge obtained permission from his Territorial associates to tell\r\nthe central Manitoba Grain Growers' Association the result of his\r\ninvestigations at Winnipeg.  The Manitoba convention was about to be\r\nheld at Brandon and on his way back home he remained over to address\r\nthe delegates.  They listened carefully to what he had to say; but when\r\nhe began to urge the necessity of the farmers themselves going into\r\ntrading in grain his fire and enthusiasm caused more excitement where\r\nhe was standing on the platform than in the audience.  The best he\r\ncould do by his earnestness was to create sufficient interest for a\r\ncommittee[1] to be appointed with instructions to investigate the\r\npossibilities of the scheme and report at the next annual convention of\r\nthe Manitoba Grain Growers' Association.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Sintaluta, however, he succeeded in stirring up his\r\nneighbors to the proper pitch of enthusiasm.  They knew him at\r\nSintaluta, listened to him seriously, and the leaders of the little\r\ncommunity shook hands on the idea of organizing, in the form of a joint\r\nstock company, \"a scheme for the co-operative marketing of grain by\r\nfarmers.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he made his report of the Winnipeg investigations at the annual\r\nconvention of the Territorial Grain Growers' Association at Moose Jaw\r\nhe found that while the principle which he advocated was favorably\r\nreceived--just as it had been in Manitoba--many farmers drew back\r\ndistrustfully from the idea of \"going into business.\"  Their experience\r\nwith business in the past had not been of a nature to instill\r\nconfidence in such a venture and if the enterprise failed, they feared\r\nit would discredit the Association.  There was a strong prejudice\r\nagainst any Association director or officer being closely identified\r\nwith such a propaganda.\r\n\r\nBack to Sintaluta went E. A. Partridge.  A public meeting was called to\r\ndiscuss the situation.  It was to be held in the Town Hall on January\r\n27th (1906) and in preparation for it a preliminary meeting was held in\r\nthe sitting-room of the hotel and a committee[2] appointed to prepare a\r\nsynopsis of what was to be done.\r\n\r\nThis synopsis was presented to the thirty farmers who gathered in the\r\nTown Hall and a lengthy resolution was passed unanimously, setting\r\nforth the aims and objects of the prospective trading company.\r\nEverybody present undertook to subscribe for shares.\r\n\r\nJustification for what they were attempting was found in \"the\r\nwidespread discontent existing among the grain growers of the West with\r\nconditions governing the marketing of their grain.\"  It was pointed out\r\nalso that the isolation of farmers from each other, their distance from\r\nthe secondary and ultimate markets and their ignorance of the details\r\nof the grain business--that these things rendered them individually\r\nliable to suffer grave injustices, even without their knowledge and\r\ncertainly without hope of remedy by individual efforts.  The scientific\r\nselling of wheat was just as important to the farmer as the scientific\r\ngrowing of it and this scientific knowledge could be obtained only by\r\nactually engaging in the business at some important commercial centre\r\nwhere the methods of successful operators could be studied.\r\n\r\nThere was every reason to believe that a scheme which limited its\r\nactivities at first to acquiring a seat on the Grain Exchange and doing\r\na straight commission business, or at most a commission and\r\ntrack-buying business--that such a co-operative scheme stood an\r\nexcellent chance of success.  Without much financial risk, it should\r\nprove immediately profitable, afford protection from crooked practices\r\nand at the same time the shareholders could gain an insight into the\r\nwhole grain business and thereby equip themselves for greater\r\nenterprises; it would not be long before they would be in a position to\r\ndeal intelligently with their problems and pertaining legislation.\r\nBesides all this there was the possible piling up of a surplus revenue,\r\nover and above dividends, which could be turned to good account in\r\nuncovering conditions in Eastern Canadian and European markets and\r\nlearning the best ways to meet those conditions.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the grain growers of Sintaluta, Saskatchewan, went on\r\nrecord at this meeting in the little Town Hall as heartily recommending\r\nthe formation of a joint stock company which was to be composed wholly\r\nof farmers and to be known as \"The Grain Growers' Grain Company,\r\nLimited,\" with shares at twenty-five dollars each.  It was stipulated\r\nthat no one person could hold more than four shares, that even these\r\nwere not to be transferable except by vote at annual meeting, and that\r\nno man could have more than one vote at annual meetings.  With this\r\nsingle far-sighted stroke the possibility of control passing into the\r\nhands of any clique was removed.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the plans set forth a committee[3] was named to take\r\ncharge of the preliminary organization work until relieved by the\r\nelection of a provisional directorate at an organization meeting which\r\nit was hoped to hold at Brandon the following March.  This committee\r\nwas authorized to conduct a campaign for subscriptions in the meantime,\r\nprinted receipts to be issued for the same.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scheme to which the farmers of Sintaluta subscribed to a\r\nman.  Two hundred shares at Sintaluta to begin with and Sintaluta only\r\none point in the West!  The Committee went to work with enthusiasm.\r\nTen dollars was spent in printing a prospectus.  E. A. Partridge got a\r\ncard and blocked out on it: GRAIN GROWERS' GRAIN COMPANY.  This he hung\r\nin the window of Wilson's old store at Sintaluta, where a dollar was\r\npaid for the use of a desk.  Here in the evenings would assemble\r\nWilliam Hall, Al Quigley, William Bonner and E. A. Partridge to send\r\nout circulars and keep the pot boiling till enough funds were on hand\r\nto let Quigley out canvassing on board wages.\r\n\r\nOn February 28th the Manitoba Grain Growers' Association held their\r\n1906 convention and as chairman of the committee appointed the year\r\nbefore to report upon the matter, E. A. Partridge again urged the\r\nadvisability of establishing a company to handle the farmers' grain.\r\nBy this time the plan had taken more definite shape and he pressed the\r\nclaims of the proposed commission company with such logic and eloquence\r\nthat besides having the committee's report adopted by the Association\r\nunanimously, he secured the interest of quite a few delegates.  There\r\nwas, nevertheless, much adverse criticism, not a little apathy and some\r\nlevity.\r\n\r\n\"Let's hold a meeting of our own,\" suggested someone.  The word was\r\npassed for all who were interested to meet in the council chamber of\r\nthe Brandon Town Hall.  Between twenty and thirty farmers attended this\r\nmeeting and the plans of the Sintaluta men for a co-operative trading\r\ncompany were approved.  It was decided to meet at the Leland Hotel in\r\nWinnipeg some time in March or April to formulate plans for an active\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nFor two days those in attendance at this second meeting discussed the\r\ndetails of the undertaking.  A great many different views were\r\nexpressed, not all of them favorable.  There were those who objected to\r\nthe chosen name of the prospective company as being a handicap upon the\r\nAssociation movement in case the venture failed.  The Sintaluta\r\nprovisional directorate was allowed to stand and the canvassing\r\ncommittee was enlarged to include a number of Manitoba men who were to\r\ntake the field for a stock canvass.\r\n\r\nThat stock-selling campaign will dodder through to the Final Memory of\r\nthose who took part in it.  The man who stood on the street-corner and\r\noffered ten-dollar gold-pieces for a dollar had no harder task.  Blood\r\nfrom stones!  Milk from dry cows!  Although ten per cent. on each share\r\nwas all the cash that was asked apparently some farmers were so hard up\r\nthat if yarn were selling at five cents per mile, they couldn't buy\r\nenough of it to make a pair of mitts for a doodlebug!\r\n\r\n\"If you take four shares,\" admitted Al Quigley at his meetings, \"I\r\ncan't guarantee that you're not losing four times $2.50, which is ten\r\ndollars.  But you lose that much when you draw a load of wheat up to\r\nthe elevator anyway,\" he argued.  \"You might just as well let another\r\nten go to see what's become of the first ten!\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh!\" grunted a skeptical farmer after one of E. A. Partridge's\r\nmeetings.  \"This here thing's just a scheme for Partridge to feather\r\nhis nest!  You bet he didn't get any o' my money,\" he bragged.  \"Did he\r\nget you, Pete?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, Ben, an' I'll tell you why.  This thing'll probably go bust;\r\nbut I put a hundred into it.  Supposin' I put a hundred in a horse an'\r\nhe dies on me.  Same thing, ain't it?  I got to have horses to do\r\nfarmin' an' I just go an' buy another one.  I figure it's worth takin'\r\na hundred-dollar chance on this thing to try her out.\"\r\n\r\nUp in the northern part of Manitoba was one man who was meeting with\r\npretty fair success.  His name was Kennedy and his friends who knew him\r\nbest called him \"Honest John.\"  His plan was simple--to start talking,\r\ntalk for awhile, then keep right on talking.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Kennedy, if $2.50 will stop you talking, here it is!\r\nWe're sleepy!\"\r\n\r\nThen he would stop talking.\r\n\r\nOne by one the original canvassers dropped out of the field till almost\r\nthe only one left besides E. A. Partridge was this hard-talking\r\nenthusiast up in the Swan River country who wound himself up for the\r\nnight and tired them out--but got the money!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix--Par. 4.\r\n\r\n[2] See Appendix--Par. 5.\r\n\r\n[3] See Appendix--Par. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA FIGHT FOR LIFE!\r\n\r\n  My dear little Demus! you'll find it is true,\r\n  He behaves like a wretch and a villain to you . . .\r\n          --Aristophanes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of John Kennedy to keep everlastingly at it.  He\r\nwas used to hard things to do.  In this life some men seem to get\r\nrather more than their share of tacks in the boots and crumbs in bed!\r\nBut every time Fate knocked him down he just picked himself up again.\r\nAlways he got up and went at it once more--patiently, conscientiously,\r\nsmiling.  Even Fate cannot beat a man like that and John Kennedy was a\r\nhard fighter in a quiet way who did not know how to quit.\r\n\r\nWith four younger brothers and an equal number of younger sisters to\r\ncrowd up to the home table down there on the farm near Beaverton,\r\nOntario County, Ontario, it was advisable for the eldest son to work\r\nout as a farm boy.  He was thirteen years old when he first hired out\r\nto a farmer for the summer and he was to receive twenty-four dollars\r\nfor the season.  But the farmer had a hard time that year and at the\r\nend of the summer--\r\n\r\n\"John,\" said the poor fellow with ill-concealed embarrassment, \"I--I'm\r\nafraid I can't pay you that money.  But you know that big flock of\r\nsheep down in the back pasture?  Well, tell you what we'll do.  Over at\r\nBeaverton I've got an uncle who's a tailor.  I can give you a suit of\r\nfull cloth of homespun and call it square,\" and though the boy wanted\r\nthe money for fifty things he had to take the homespun suit.\r\n\r\nThree or four hobble-de-hoy years of it on the farms of the\r\nneighborhood and young Kennedy literally took to the woods and drove\r\nthe rivers in Muskoka and Michigan as a lumberjack till he was a chunk\r\nof whalebone in a red flannel shirt and corked boots and could pull the\r\nwhiskers out of a wild-cat!  With varying success he fought the battle\r\nof life and learned that many things glitter besides gold and that the\r\nfour-leafed clover in this life after all is a square deal between men.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of E. A. Partridge at the convention of the Manitoba Grain\r\nGrowers in 1906 therefore found John Kennedy feeling responsive.  He\r\nknew the unjust position in which the farmers were placed; for he was a\r\nfarmer himself--up in the Swan River Valley--and he was a delegate from\r\nthe Swan River Grain Growers' Association.  The idea of forming a\r\nfarmers' commission company for handling the farmers' grain sounded\r\nlike a very satisfactory solution of a very unsatisfactory state of\r\naffairs and he threw himself whole-heartedly into the campaign to sell\r\nenough stock to obtain a charter.\r\n\r\nUp in the newer part of the country, which was his own particular\r\nterritory, he found the farmers ready enough to listen; for they had\r\nsuffered up there from the evils at which the new movement was aiming.\r\nHe found also that the most interested members of his audiences were\r\nmen who could least afford to lose any money.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made to discredit the whole proposition as a political\r\nmove of the Conservative Party.  Throughout the Swan River district,\r\nthe Dauphin district and all the way down to Neepawa the rumor spread\r\nahead of the meetings; so that the speakers were asked many pertinent\r\nand impertinent questions, J. W. Robson, a Swan River farmer who was at\r\nthat time a Conservative Member of the Manitoba Legislature, was giving\r\nhis services free as a speaker on behalf of the proposed company; John\r\nKennedy was known to be a political supporter of J. W. Robson.  One and\r\none make two; two and two sometimes make a fairly large-sized political\r\nrumor.  But Mr. Robson was a ready and convincing speaker who was known\r\nto be a farmer first and last and Mr. Kennedy attributes the practical\r\nresults obtained as due largely to Mr. Robson's logic and sincerity.\r\n\r\nAlong in June Kennedy received a telegram from Winnipeg that startled\r\nhim.  It contained the first intimation that difficulties were arising\r\nat Ottawa to prevent the proposed farmers' company from getting their\r\ncharter.  Taking the first train, he found on his arrival at Winnipeg\r\nthat Francis Graham and W. A. Robinson, the two committeemen who met\r\nhim, had not yet notified E. A. Partridge.  A wire was despatched at\r\nonce to Sintaluta and the Chairman joined them by first train.  For two\r\ndays the Board wrestled with this unexpected difficulty which\r\nthreatened to annihilate the company before it got started.\r\n\r\nThe application of the Organization Committee for a charter was refused\r\non the ground that the shares of a company with a capital of $250,000\r\ncould not be less than $100 each.  Their solicitor tried in vain to\r\ninduce the Department to change its views, all canvassing to sell stock\r\nbeing discontinued by the Committee in the meantime.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let 'em keep their charter if they want to,\" said Kennedy\r\nfinally.  \"This discussion's not getting us anywhere and if we can't\r\nget a Dominion charter, why we can't get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess you're right, John.  We might as well quit and go on home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who said anything about quitting?\"  Kennedy brought down his big fist\r\non the table with a thump.  \"We'll get a Manitoba charter.  That's what\r\nI mean.\"\r\n\r\nThe others shook their heads.  A Provincial charter would be useless\r\nfor what they were proposing to do, they contended.  Kennedy disagreed\r\nso emphatically that he refused to stop arguing about it till at last\r\nhe and John Spencer were delegated to see the Manitoba authorities.  In\r\nthe course of a few days the arrangements for a Provincial charter were\r\ncomplete, and the Committee turned its attention to selling enough\r\nstock to be ready for business by the middle of the following month.\r\n\r\nBy this time the harvest season was so near at hand that prompt action\r\nwas necessary if they were to do any business that fall.  Under the\r\nManitoba charter the company could open for business with a provisional\r\ndirectorate and as five members of the original committee were in\r\nWinnipeg and available for quick action, it was decided to go ahead as\r\nit would be impossible to hold a representative general meeting of the\r\nshareholders before harvest and it was advisable in the interests of\r\nthe subscribers to take advantage of the opportunity to do business in\r\nthe meantime.\r\n\r\nProvisional organization therefore was undertaken during the week of\r\nthe Winnipeg Industrial Exhibition, in a tent on the Fair grounds, and\r\nJuly 26th was set as the date.  When space was sought for the erection\r\nof their sixteen-foot tent, however, they found themselves classed with\r\nthe \"Sunflower Belles\" and \"Katzenjammer Castle\" and it was only after\r\nthe payment of fifty dollars that permission was granted for the\r\nerection of the tent.  Here to the accompaniment of a raucous medley of\r\nsounds--the beating of tom-toms, the ballyhooing of the sideshows, the\r\nracket of the machinery exhibits and the cries of the peanut and\r\nlemonade vendors--the farmers' trading company was organized with\r\nprovisional officers[1] and directorate in legal shape to start the\r\nwheels in motion as a joint stock company.\r\n\r\nBut before actual business could begin a manager must be located who\r\nknew all the ins and outs and ups and downs of the grain business; also\r\na seat upon the Winnipeg Grain Exchange must be purchased before the\r\nfarmers could enter the arena as dealers in grain.  None of the\r\nofficers of the young company which was about to try its wings\r\noverlooked the fact that nothing could be more foolhardy than for\r\nfarmers like themselves, direct from the green pastures, to attempt the\r\nplunge they were about to take without proper guidance as to the depth\r\nof the water and the set of the currents.  They knew they were\r\nembarking in a most intricate and difficult business and with so much\r\nat stake on behalf of the whole farming population of Western Canada it\r\nwas necessary to place the helm in the hands of somebody who could\r\npilot them through the shoals.  At best it promised to be a stormy\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nAbout the only man in sight for the position was Thomas Coulter, of the\r\nIndependent Grain Company.  He had treated E. A. Partridge with more\r\nconsideration as the \"Farmers' Representative\" than most of the other\r\ngrain men and there was a possibility that he might be persuaded to\r\ntake the offer seriously.  But on approaching him, Mr. Coulter did not\r\nbecome excited over the prospect of managing a farmers' company in the\r\ngrain business; even he was not inclined to take too seriously the\r\neffort of the farmers to do their own trading.  How long would the\r\nfarmers stand behind the company in the face of the competition that\r\nwould be brought to bear?  That was the question that bulged right out\r\nin front; for, as everybody knew, farmers never had been able to hang\r\ntogether very long when it came down to a matter of dollars and cents\r\nin their individual pockets.  Finally, however, he agreed that there\r\nmight be a fighting chance and accepted the management.\r\n\r\nSo far so good.  But what about the seat on the Grain Exchange?  The\r\nprice of it was $2,500.  One thousand shares of the company's stock had\r\nbeen disposed of with ten per cent. paid up and from the $2,500 thus\r\nrealized the expenses of organization had to be met, the charter paid\r\nfor, the legal fee and expenses at Ottawa in connection with the effort\r\nto secure a Dominion charter, office rent, printing bills and what not.\r\n\r\n\"Which leaves us about $1,000 to buy a $2,500 seat and finance our\r\nfirst business operations,\" said John Spencer with the look of a\r\nworried Secretary-Treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to issue a twenty per cent. call on subscribed stock,\"\r\nadmitted the President reluctantly.  \"In the meantime I'll have to see\r\nif some of the boys out at Sintaluta will go security for the fifteen\r\nhundred.  Thank heaven, these fellows down here think we're a hilarious\r\njoke!  The only chance we've got to get through the fence with this\r\nthing is for them to keep right on laughing at us till we get our toes\r\nin the sand!\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Sintaluta, explaining the situation, and five of E. A.\r\nPartridge's friends[2] at once responded by going to the bank with\r\ntheir personal notes for the amount needed.\r\n\r\n\"With support like that we're going to win, boys,\" cried the President\r\nproudly when the bank notified them that the money was available.\r\n\r\nFinancial arrangements were established with the Bank of British North\r\nAmerica and when a room had been rented on the top floor of the old\r\nTribune building and circulars sent broadcast among the farmers,\r\nsoliciting grain, the wheels began to turn.\r\n\r\nThe little office was opened for business on September 5th (1906).  It\r\nwas so small that even two or three people got in each other's way,\r\nthough all they were doing was to watch the mails anxiously for the\r\nfirst indications as to whether the farmers would stand behind the big\r\nidea that was now put to the test.  Then came the bill of lading for\r\nthe first carload of grain consigned to the new company, followed\r\nquickly by the second, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth--two at a time,\r\nthree, ten, fifteen per day!  Every foot of space in the little office\r\nwas a busy spot and the lone typewriter clickety-clacked on the\r\nsecond-hand table with cheerful disregard of lunch hours.  By the end\r\nof the month the weekly receipts had risen to one hundred cars of grain.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary to move to a larger office and accommodation was\r\nobtained in the Henderson Block.  At the present rate, a whole floor\r\nwould be needed soon.\r\n\r\nOver at the Grain Exchange some men were talking seriously.  They were\r\ntalking about E. A. Partridge and they were not laughing.  The\r\nSecretary of the Exchange was instructed to write a letter.\r\n\r\nPartridge hit the desk so hard that the paper-knife with which he had\r\nsliced open that letter hopped to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"They're after us already!\" he exploded.\r\n\r\nIt looked that way.  The Company's seat on the Grain Exchange was held\r\nin the name of the President and the letter summoned him to appear\r\nbefore the Council of the Exchange to answer to a charge of having\r\nsinned against the honor and \"diginity\" of that institution and of\r\nviolating its rules.  A short time before the young company had issued\r\na circular setting forth their intention of dividing co-operatively\r\nwhatever profits were earned; in other words, the man sending the\r\nlarger amount of grain would receive the larger profits.  This, the\r\nExchange claimed, was a violation of the strict rules of the Grain\r\nExchange and would have to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"You are virtually splitting the commission with the shipper,\" claimed\r\nthe Exchange, \"and we can't allow that for a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's up to you to prove I'm guilty, not up to me to come here and\r\ncommit myself,\" argued Partridge.  \"If you can find any profits that\r\nhave been distributed co-operatively by the Grain Growers' Grain\r\nCompany, go ahead.  Nor have I sinned against your 'diginity'!\" he\r\nadded, sarcastically taking advantage of the stenographer's error in\r\nspelling.  \"For that matter, you've been digging into me ever since I\r\ncame on here!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't do any more business with our members till you change your\r\nways,\" declared the Exchange and forthwith, on October 25th, notice was\r\nposted to all Exchange members that any of them found dealing with the\r\nfarmers' company would be penalized themselves.\r\n\r\nExpelled from trading privileges!  Practically boycotted!  It was a\r\nstraight punch on the nose that threatened to put the young\r\norganization out of business for the final count.  Membership in the\r\nExchange was absolutely imperative if the farmers were to be in a\r\nposition to sell grain to exporters; they were not strong enough yet to\r\nexport direct to Old Country markets and all the exporters through whom\r\nthey were compelled to deal were members of the Exchange.\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing's just a pretext!\" cried Partridge vehemently.  \"We\r\nhaven't got any by-law regarding distribution of profits\r\nco-operatively; the only thing they've got to go on is that circular.\r\nThey're beginning to get scared of us and they see a chance to put us\r\nout of business.\"\r\n\r\nIf this were the object, it looked as if it might be achieved in short\r\norder.  The grain was pouring in steadily by the carload and with no\r\nbuyer daring to deal with them in face of the mandate from the\r\nExchange, of which they were all members, the new company was in a\r\nquandary to dispose of the incoming grain on a falling market.  The\r\nonly thing they could do was to wait until they had sufficient of any\r\ngrade to make a shipment of from 8,000 to 10,000 bushels of that grade\r\nand try to place it somewhere in the East.  The Manager was sent east\r\nhurriedly to see what connections he could establish while his office\r\nassistant mailed letter after letter to eastern points in an endeavor\r\nto work several contracts.\r\n\r\nThe farmers who shipped their grain to the new company were expecting\r\nto receive seventy-five per cent. of an advance from the bank on their\r\nbills of lading and a prompt remittance of the balance when the\r\nInspection Certificate and Outturn were in the hands of the Company.\r\nWith the grain piling up on their company day by day, it was not long\r\nbefore the overdraft at the bank began to assume alarming proportions.\r\n\r\nLuckily the Assistant Manager succeeded in making several sales in the\r\nEast, which eased away from the crisis which was shaping.  It was quite\r\npatent that it would have been suicide for the young trading\r\norganization to notify the farmers to stop sending in business.  They\r\ndare not do that.\r\n\r\nIn desperation the President and Vice-President went to the Manitoba\r\nGovernment and laid their case in full before the cabinet.  Premier R.\r\nP. Roblin (now Sir Rodmond Roblin) was very much surprised to learn the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\"The Government certainly cannot countenance any such action on the\r\npart of the grain dealers,\" he declared emphatically.  \"We cannot allow\r\nthem to boycott a company composed of farmers who have as much right to\r\nsell grain as any other body of men.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Government set a time limit within which the Exchange\r\nhad the option of removing the ban against the farmers' company or of\r\nlosing their Provincial charter.  In the meantime, however, this did\r\nnot obtain restoration of trading privileges, without which the\r\nfarmers' company could not do business with Exchange members except by\r\npaying them the full commission of one cent per bushel.\r\n\r\nThe situation, therefore, was approaching a crisis rapidly.  The\r\ncompany was fortunate in having the friendship of their local bank\r\nmanager; but even he could not go on forever making advances on\r\nconsigned grain and there was some suspicion that letters were reaching\r\nthe head office of the bank in Montreal, advising that the quicker this\r\nparticular account was closed out the better off the bank would be.\r\n\r\nThen one morning the local manager called on the Executive and his face\r\nwas grave.\r\n\r\n\"This is not the first time I've heard from the Head Office about this\r\naccount, as you know,\" he began at once, \"but I'm afraid it's the last\r\ncall, gentlemen.\"  He handed a letter to the President.  \"As you see, I\r\nam instructed to close out your account at once unless further security\r\nis forthcoming.  I'm sorry; for I believe you've merely run into hard\r\nluck in getting squared away.  But--I'm not the bank, you understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want us to do?  What can we do?\" asked Partridge\r\nanxiously.  \"This thing will straighten out, Mr. Machaffie.  We're\r\ngetting the business.  You know that.  We're going to get back our\r\ntrading privileges and everything will be alright.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker shook his head slowly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, gentlemen.  But do you know what your overdraft amounts to\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred and fifty-six thousand dollars,\" murmured the\r\nSecretary-Treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before coming here I've been to see the Scottish Co-Operative\r\nWholesale Society about taking some of your wheat.  Fisher is ready to\r\nhelp you out if he finds he's not overstepping the rules of the\r\nExchange.  I may be able to carry you along for a short time if you\r\nthree gentlemen, the Executive of your company, will give the bank your\r\npersonal bond without limit as to the amount.  I have even gone so far\r\nas to draw up the document for signature, if it meets with your\r\napproval.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about that, Kennedy?  Spencer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess we've got to do it,\" nodded Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like it,\" agreed Spencer.\r\n\r\n\"Then--down she goes!\" decided Partridge, dipping his pen in the ink.\r\nThe others signed after him.\r\n\r\n\"That means we three go down with the ship,\" he remarked quietly after\r\nthe door had closed upon the bank manager.  \"I appreciate you two\r\nfellows signing that thing.\"  He got up and shook hands with each of\r\nthem in turn.  \"If bad gets worse and we go to smash----\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't get worse and we're not going to smash,\" reassured the others.\r\n\r\nBut that remained to be seen.  Although placing grain in the East was\r\nrobbing them of profits, it was the best that could be done to tide\r\nthings over.  The three active officials were on the anxious seat from\r\nmorning till night.  It had got down now to a question of meeting each\r\nday's events as they came and frequently the lights blazed in the\r\nlittle office till two and three in the morning while the provisional\r\nofficers raked the situation from every angle in an endeavor to\r\nforecast the next day's difficulties and to prepare for them.\r\n\r\nFor three months the overdraft at the bank had averaged $275,000, due\r\nalmost entirely to the conditions resulting from the action of the\r\nExchange.  It was useless to worry over the amount of interest which\r\nthis accommodation was costing and the profits which might have been\r\nrolled up had things been different; the real worry was to keep going\r\nat any cost.  For, as the bank manager had intimated, the whole thing\r\nwas just hard luck rather than any unsoundness in the business.  It was\r\na fine paradox that the more pronounced the success of the idea itself\r\nbecame, the greater grew the danger of complete failure because of the\r\npredicament!  Death by wheat!  An ironical fate indeed for a grain\r\ncompany!\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, the farmers' company discovered that their original\r\nidea of distributing their profits co-operatively--as embodied in the\r\ncircular to which the Exchange had objected--was contrary to the\r\nprovisions of the Manitoba Joint Stock Companies' Act under which they\r\nheld their charter.  Therefore the co-operative idea in connection with\r\nprofits was formally dropped by the Grain Growers' Grain Company.  This\r\nhad been done at a directors' meeting on December 22nd (1906), when a\r\nresolution had been passed, cancelling the proposal contained in the\r\nobjectionable circular.[3]  But although the Exchange had been notified\r\nimmediately and repeated applications for reinstatement had been made,\r\nthe farmers' company was still struggling along in the throes of their\r\ndilemma--proof positive, concluded the farmers, that the Grain Exchange\r\nhad used the co-operative suggestion as a mere pretext to oust the\r\nCompany from the field altogether.\r\n\r\nIn piled the wheat, car after car of it!  A considerable portion of it\r\nhad been bought on track and farmers who had consigned their grain were\r\nanxious, naturally, to have it disposed of without delay.  With prices\r\ngoing down and navigation on the point of closing, the best hopes of\r\nthe management became centred in getting a big shipment away to Buffalo\r\nby boat.  That would enable them to escape a big item in storage\r\ncharges and to place the grain in line for export at rates considerably\r\nbelow the all-rail figures.\r\n\r\n\"With those bills of lading in the bank, we've no control of them and\r\nthe bank can do just about as it likes,\" reviewed the President one\r\nnight.  \"If they should come down on us to sell our wheat inside of\r\nforty-eight hours--we're goners, boys!  All that those fellows over at\r\nthe Exchange have got to do is to shove down the market thirty points\r\nand our name is _mud_!  The loss to the farmers who've shipped us their\r\ngrain will kill this movement and every one like it in the West for all\r\ntime to come.  This company will be as dead as a doornail and so will\r\nwe financially as its bonded backers.\"\r\n\r\nKennedy was running a finger tentatively down the window-pane.  It left\r\na streak in the forming frost.\r\n\r\n\"What I want to know is, how long ought it to take to load up this\r\nwhole boatload we're trying to move?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, about seventeen hours or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how long have they been at it already?  Five days, ain't it?  And\r\nshe's not away yet!  What d'you suppose that means?\" he snapped.  He\r\nbegan to throw things into a grip.  He made for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Where'n the mischief are you going, John?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fort William--can just make the train if I hustle.  The _J. P. Walsh_\r\ngets out of that harbor with that wheat of ours, by Hickory!--if she\r\nhas to be chopped out with an axe!\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later a telegram reached the little office:\r\n\r\n_S.S. J. P. Walsh_ cleared to-day for Buffalo.  Three hundred and ten\r\nthousand bushels.  Last boat out.  KENNEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix--Par. 7.\r\n\r\n[2] See Appendix--Par. 8.\r\n\r\n[3] This resolution was confirmed at a meeting of the shareholders,\r\nFebruary 5th, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA KNOCK ON THE DOOR\r\n\r\nEvery man is worth just as much as the things are worth about which he\r\nis concerned.--_Marcus Aurelius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat big shipment to Buffalo, along with several others which were\r\nplaced in the East with the market recovering, relieved the situation\r\ngreatly.  Also, the Scottish Co-Operative Wholesale Society's Winnipeg\r\noffice decided to stand by the farmers' co-operative marketing venture\r\nand risked disapproval to buy some of the young company's wheat; not\r\nonly that, but the farmers' company was allowed the regular commission\r\nof one cent per bushel on the purchase and the cheque paid in to the\r\nbank amounted to $58,298.  This friendly co-operation the farmers were\r\nnot quick to forget and they still speak of it with gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt began to look as if the struggling farmers' agency might worry\r\nthrough the winter after all.  The strain of the past few months had\r\ntold upon the men at the head of the young organization and especially\r\nupon the provisional President, who felt keenly the responsibilities of\r\nhis office.  Of a sensitive, high-strung temperament, E. A. Partridge\r\nsuffered reaction to such a degree that at times he became almost\r\ndespondent.\r\n\r\nHe began to talk of resigning.  He felt that he had done quite a lot in\r\ngetting things under way and that the hard fight which the farmers\r\nwould have to wage before the trading company was established\r\npermanently would be carried on more successfully by a younger man.  So\r\nfrequently had his motives been questioned by suspicious farmers at\r\norganization meetings that he thought it would be better for the\r\ncompany if he occupied a less prominent place in the conduct of its\r\naffairs.  The idea seemed to be prevalent that the organizers were\r\nenthusiastic for direct financial reasons.  \"Those fellows are talking\r\nfor what they are going to get out of it,\" was an open accusation at\r\ntimes--a misconception so unjust that on several occasions Partridge\r\nhad refuted it by pledging to resign from the presidency as soon as the\r\ncompany was on its feet.\r\n\r\n\"You men keep saying how much I've got out of this,\" he reproved in\r\ndisheartened tones.  \"Gentlemen, I'll admit that I've got a little\r\nsilver out of this.  But it isn't in my pocket; it's in my hair!\"\r\n\r\nPartridge had no respect for a \"quitter,\" however.  He did not propose\r\nto take it easy until the farmers' agency did get into proper running\r\norder.  Although his associates tried to dissuade him altogether from\r\nthe course he had planned, the best he would promise was to remain at\r\nhis post until the first annual meeting.\r\n\r\nImmediately preceding the annual convention of the Manitoba Grain\r\nGrowers' Association at Brandon in February a general meeting of Grain\r\nGrowers' Grain Company shareholders was held with about two hundred\r\nrepresented.  Until now the company had been operating under a\r\nprovisional directorate only and it was the purpose of the meeting to\r\ncomplete organization.  Since opening for business the shareholders had\r\npractically doubled in number and over 1,500,000 bushels of farmers'\r\ngrain had been handled by their own agency, its ability to dispose of\r\nwheat at good figures being demonstrated in spite of deprivation of\r\ntrading privileges on the Exchange.  Putting a conservative estimate\r\nupon the holdings of the farmers' venture into co-operative marketing,\r\nits paid-up capital remained intact, its organization expenses\r\npaid--including the membership on the Grain Exchange--and there still\r\nwas left a respectable margin of profit.  To this showing the\r\nshareholders responded by electing the provisional directorate as\r\ndirectors for the balance of the year, adding two[1] to their number,\r\nwhile the same officers were left in charge.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the directorate it was pointed out that it might be\r\nbetter to have the trading company's directorate independent of the\r\nAssociation's directorate.  The suggestion came from a tall young man\r\nwho had a habit of thinking before he spoke and it was but one of many\r\npractical ideas which he had thrown out at the meeting.\r\n\r\n\"That young chap, Crerar, of Russell--makings of an able man there,\r\nEd,\" commented the re-elected Vice-president later.  \"Know anything\r\nabout him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know his father better than I do him,\" nodded the President\r\nthoughtfully.  \"I met his father in the old Patron movement years ago.\r\nI've got a great respect for his attitude of mind towards moral and\r\neconomic questions.  I like that young man's views, Kennedy; he seems\r\nto have a grasp of what this movement could accomplish--of the aims\r\nthat might be served beyond the commercial side of it.  In short, he\r\nseems to be somewhat of a student of economics and he has the\r\neducation--used to be a school-teacher, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember when I went up to Russell, during their Fair in October, to\r\ntell them what the Exchange was trying to do to us?  Well, he was at\r\nthe meeting and came over to my room at the hotel afterward,\" remarked\r\nKennedy.  \"That's how interested he was.  We had quite a talk over the\r\nwhole situation.  Told me he had an arrangement to buy grain for Graves\r\n& Reilly, besides running the Farmers' Elevator at Russell, and he\r\noffered to ship us all the grain that wasn't consigned to his firm.\r\nWe've got quite a few carloads from him during the season.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there were only a few more elevator operators like him!\" sighed\r\nPartridge.  \"When I was up there last July, selling stock, only eight\r\nmen turned out,\" he recalled.  \"Crerar was one of them.  I sold four\r\nshares.  Crerar bought one.  Say, he'd be a good man to have on the\r\nnext directorate.  How would it be if I wrote him a letter about it?\"\r\n\r\nBut \"Alex.\" Crerar laid that letter aside and promptly forgot it; he\r\ndid not take it seriously enough to answer it.  If there was anything\r\nhe could do to help along a thing in which he believed as thoroughly as\r\nhe believed in the grain growers' movement and the farmers' agency he\r\nwas more than willing to do it; but executive offices, he felt, were\r\nfor older and more experienced men than he.\r\n\r\nAs manager of an elevator in his home town, as buyer for a grain firm\r\nand as a farmer himself he had had opportunities for studying the\r\nsituation from many angles.  From the first he had followed the\r\norganization of the farmers with much interest and sympathy.  He could\r\nnot forget his own early experiences in marketing grain when the\r\nelevators offered him fifty-nine cents per bushel, nineteen cents under\r\nthe price at the terminal at the time.  The freight rate on his No. 1\r\nNorthern wheat he knew to be only nine cents per bushel and when he was\r\ndocked a bushel and a half to a load of fifty bushels on top of it all\r\nhe had been aroused to protest.\r\n\r\nA protest from young Crerar was no mild and bashful affair, either.  It\r\nwas big-fisted with vigor.  But when, with characteristic spirit, he\r\nhad pointed out the injustice of the price offered and the dockage\r\ntaken--the elevator man, quite calmly, had told him to go to the devil!\r\n\r\n\"There's no use going to the other elevators, for you're all alike,\"\r\nsaid young Crerar hotly.\r\n\r\n\"Then take your damned grain home again!\" grinned the elevator operator\r\ninsolently.\r\n\r\nSo the young farmer was compelled to sell his first wheat for what he\r\ncould get.  He was prepared to pay three cents per bushel on the\r\nspread, that being a reasonable charge; but although plenty of cars\r\nwere available at the time, the spread cost him ten cents, a direct\r\nloss of seven cents per bushel.  Besides this he was forced to see\r\nbetween twenty-five and thirty bushels out of every thousand\r\nappropriated for dockage, no matter how clean the wheat might be.  That\r\nwas in 1902.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to forget that kind of treatment.  And when, later on,\r\nyoung Crerar accepted an offer of $75 per month to manage a Farmers'\r\nElevator at Russell he bore his own experience in mind and extended\r\nevery possible consideration to the farmers who came to him.  The\r\nelevator company, as a company, did not buy grain; but as\r\nrepresentative of Graves & Reilly, a Winnipeg firm, he bought odd lots\r\nand for this service received an extra fifty dollars per month.\r\n\r\nFinancially, it was better than teaching school.  He had made ten\r\ndollars the first summer he taught school and to earn it he had walked\r\nthree miles and a half each morning after milking the cows at home,\r\narriving at the school soaking wet with dew from wading in the long\r\nprairie grass.  And even at that, the trustees had wanted a \"cheaper\"\r\nteacher!  A woman, they thought, might do it cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe young schoolmaster objected so earnestly, however, that the\r\nargument was dropped.  He needed this money to assist in a plan for\r\nattending the Collegiate at Portage la Prairie.  He taught the school\r\nso well that after studying Latin at Manitoba College in 1899, the\r\ntrustees were glad to get him back the following year at a salary of\r\n$35 per month.\r\n\r\nBut milking cows at home night and morning and teaching school in\r\nbetween was not an exciting life at best for a young fellow ambitious\r\nto go farming.  So at last he acquired a quarter-section of Hudson Bay\r\nCompany land near Russell and took to \"baching it\" in a little frame\r\nshack.\r\n\r\nIn the fall some lumber was required for buildings and it so happened\r\nthat along came an old chap with a proposition to put in a portable\r\nsawmill on a timber limit up in the Riding Mountains nearby.  The old\r\nman meant business alright; he had the engine within ten miles of its\r\ndestination before he was overtaken and the whole machine seized for\r\ndebt.  It looked as if the thousands of logs which the residents of the\r\ndistrict had taken out for the expected mill had been piled up to no\r\npurpose.  Crerar, however, succeeded in making a deal for the engine\r\nand, with a couple of partners, began sawing up logs.  The little\r\nsawmill proved so useful that he ran it for four winters.  When finally\r\nit was burned down no attempt was made to rebuild.  Its owner was\r\nentering wider fields of activity.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting Partridge and Kennedy his interest in the affairs of the\r\nfarmers' little trading concern was quickened.  He was much impressed\r\nwith the fact that here were men so devoted to an idea--so profound in\r\ntheir belief that it was the right idea--that its advancement was their\r\nfirst and only thought at all times.  Alex. Crerar liked that.  If a\r\nthing were worth attempting at all, it was worth every concentration of\r\neffort.  What these men were trying to accomplish appealed to him as a\r\nbig thing, a bigger thing than most of the farmers yet realized, and it\r\ndeserved all the help he could give it.  The little agency was in the\r\nthick of a fight against tremendous odds and that, too, had its appeal;\r\nfor to a natural born fighter the odds meant merely a bigger fight, a\r\nbigger triumph.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the young man lost no opportunity to boost things along.\r\nHe was able to consign many carloads of grain in a season.  If an idea\r\noccurred to him that he thought might be of service he sat down and\r\nwrote a letter, offering the suggestion on the chance that it might\r\nprove useful to the Executive.  He did everything he could to build up\r\nthe Company's business in the Russell district and when he returned\r\nhome from the shareholders' organization meeting he kept right on\r\nsending in business, offering helpful suggestions and saying a good\r\nword when possible.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by and it became more apparent that they would wind\r\nup their first year's business satisfactorily, E. A. Partridge decided\r\ndefinitely that he would not accept another term as President.  There\r\nwere several good men available to succeed him; but he could not get it\r\nout of his head that the one man for the tasks ahead was the young\r\nfellow up at Russell.  When he went there in June to speak at a Grain\r\nGrowers' picnic he drew Crerar aside for an hour's chat, found out why\r\nhe had not answered the letter suggesting that he play a more active\r\npart, and liked him all the better for his modesty.\r\n\r\nWithout saying anything of what he had in mind he returned to Winnipeg\r\nand sent the Vice-President to Russell to size up the situation\r\nquietly.  When Kennedy got back he agreed with the President's choice\r\nof a successor.\r\n\r\nThe Company was holding its first annual meeting on July 16th and care\r\nwas taken that the unsuspecting Crerar was on hand.  The Vice-president\r\nbutton-holed him, explaining that he was wanted on the Board of\r\nDirectors and in spite of his protest the President himself nominated\r\nhim and he was elected promptly.\r\n\r\nBut when at the directors' meeting that night the President told the\r\nBoard that he had been looking around for a young man to take charge\r\nand that T. A. Crerar was the man--when everybody present nodded\r\napproval, the man from Russell was speechless.  If they had asked him\r\nto pack his grip and leave at once for Japan to interview the Mikado,\r\nhe could not have been more completely surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Why, gentlemen\" he objected, \"I don't know anything about managing\r\nthis company!  I could not undertake it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the next order of business?\" asked E. A. Partridge.\r\n\r\nThe shareholders were almost as much surprised as the newcomer himself\r\nwhen the name of the new president was announced.  Many of them had\r\nnever heard of T. A. Crerar.  Had the young president-elect been able\r\nto see what lay ahead of him--\r\n\r\nBut, fortunately or unfortunately, that is one thing which is denied to\r\nevery human being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix--Par. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE GRAIN EXCHANGE AGAIN\r\n\r\n\"How many tables, Janet, are there in the Law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir, I canna just be certain; but I think there's ane in the\r\nforeroom, ane in the back room an' anither upstairs.\"\r\n            --_Scotch Wit and Humor (Howe)_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the elevator faction of the Winnipeg Grain and Produce\r\nExchange, apparently to choke to death the Grain Growers' Grain\r\nCompany, had awakened the farmers of the West to a fuller realization\r\nof the trading company's importance to the whole farmers' movement.\r\nThe Grain Growers of the three prairie provinces had been watching\r\nthings closely and they did not propose to let matters take their\r\ncourse unchallenged.  A second Royal Commission had been appointed by\r\nthe Dominion Government in 1906, under the chairmanship of John Millar,\r\nIndian Head, Saskatchewan, to probe conditions in the grain trade and\r\nthe farmers felt that certain evidence which had been taken by this\r\nCommission at Winnipeg justified their claims that they were the\r\nvictims of a combine.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of November (1906) the President of the Manitoba\r\nGrain Growers' Association, D. W. McCuaig, laid formal charges against\r\nthree members of the Winnipeg Grain and Produce Exchange--charges of\r\nconspiring in restraint of trade--and when these gentlemen appeared in\r\nthe Police Court it was evident that the Exchange intended to fight the\r\ncase every inch of the way.  The farmers discovered that the legal\r\ntalent of Winnipeg had been cornered; for of the twenty lawyers to whom\r\ntheir solicitor, R. A. Bonnar, K.C., could turn for assistance in the\r\nprosecution every one appeared to have been retained by the defendants.\r\nThe case involved such wide investigation that such assistance was\r\nimperative and finally the Grain Growers secured the services of\r\nex-Premier F. W. G. Haultain,[1] of Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary hearing in the Police Court proved to be most\r\ninteresting and at times developed considerable heat among the battling\r\nlegal lights.  The defendants and their friends were so confident that\r\ncommitment for trial would not be forthcoming at all that when the\r\nMagistrate decided that he was justified in so ordering, the grain men\r\nwere shocked somewhat rudely out of their complacency.\r\n\r\nFollowing up this preliminary victory, the Manitoba Grain Growers\r\nturned to the Manitoba Government and demanded that the charter under\r\nwhich the Grain Exchange operated be amended in certain particulars.\r\nThe deputation from the Grain Growers met the Committee on Agriculture,\r\nthe House being in session, and asked that the powers of the charter be\r\nlimited so that business would be conducted on an equitable basis\r\nbetween buyer and producer.  They asked that the Exchange be allowed to\r\nset no limit as to the number of persons who might enjoy its\r\nprivileges, the question of the reputability of such persons to be\r\ndecided by a majority of the members and that a seat purchased for the\r\nuse of any firm or corporation should entitle that firm to the\r\nprivileges of the Exchange even though registration of membership was\r\nunder the name of an individual; also that the right to membership\r\nshould include the right to delegate the trading powers to anyone in\r\nthe employ of the firm or corporation.\r\n\r\nThe Grain Growers also asked that arbitrary interference with the\r\nbusiness methods employed by individual firms or corporations and\r\ninquisitional inquiry into such be prohibited; also that the penalties\r\nand disabilities against those breaking the common rules and the\r\nmaximum-price rule be abolished; that the right to define the\r\neligibility of a person as an employee or fix a limit to salary in any\r\nway be denied; also that the expulsion of no member should be\r\nconsidered final until assented to by the Minister of Agriculture and\r\nthat all by-laws should receive the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nin Council before becoming legal and binding.\r\n\r\nThe farmers asked that the Government have full access to the minute\r\nbooks, papers and accounts of the Grain Exchange and that provision be\r\nmade for the public to have free access to a gallery overlooking the\r\ntrading room during the sessions of the Exchange so that the\r\ntransactions occurring might be observed and the prices disseminated\r\nthrough the public press.  They further wished to see gambling in\r\nfutures made a criminal offence.\r\n\r\nRoderick McKenzie, Secretary of the Manitoba Association, told how the\r\nexisting Grain Exchange had about three hundred members, of whom one\r\nhundred were active and fifty-seven of these active members represented\r\nthe elevator interests.  He said that the interests of the fifty-seven\r\nwere looked after by twelve elevator men in the Exchange and that these\r\ntwelve men agreed so well that they allowed one of their number to send\r\nout the price which should be paid for wheat for the day.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Agriculture promised to consider the requests and\r\nlater, when they met to do so, members of the Grain Exchange attended\r\nin force to present their side of the case.  They claimed that a great\r\ndeal of the trouble existing between the producer and the Grain\r\nExchange was due to misconception of the Exchange's methods of action.\r\nThe Exchange was only a factor in the grain business and under their\r\ncharter they were allowed to make by-laws and regulations, these being\r\nnecessary in such an intricate business as handling grain.\r\n\r\nThe wiring of prices to country points was done by the North-West Grain\r\nDealers' Association, which had nothing to do with the Exchange but was\r\na distinct and separate organization for the purpose of running\r\nelevators at country points as cheaply as possible.  The highest\r\npossible prices were quoted and the plan was merely to avoid duplicate\r\nwiring.\r\n\r\nThe grain men claimed that it was impossible to handle the wheat of the\r\ncountry unless futures were allowed while to carry on its business\r\nproperly the Exchange must have the power to say who should be members\r\nand otherwise to regulate its business.  If the producer was getting\r\nfull value for his wheat why should the Grain Exchange be interfered\r\nwith?\r\n\r\nThe Exchange was willing that its membership should be extended.  Their\r\nbooks always would be open to Government inspection in future and they\r\nwould also repeal the rule regarding track-buyers' salaries.  The press\r\nwas already admitted and it would be found that when the new building\r\nwhich the Exchange was erecting was completed there would be a gallery\r\nfor the use of the public during trading hours.\r\n\r\nIf the Legislature were to amend the charter, declared the Exchange's\r\nspokesman, the Exchange would demand that the charter be cancelled _in\r\ntoto_ and a receiver appointed to distribute the assets.  The Exchange\r\nwas tired of being branded thieves and robbers and they should be let\r\nalone to do their business.  If this were not satisfactory, then they\r\nwished to be put out of business altogether.\r\n\r\nThe Grain Growers protested that it was not their desire to have the\r\ncharter cancelled.  They were not blind to the usefulness of the\r\nExchange if it were properly managed and all they asked was that this\r\norganization be compelled to do what was right.  The reason the\r\nExchange had admitted the Grain Growers' Grain Company, the farmers\r\nclaimed, was so that they could have it under discipline, being afraid\r\nof a combination of farmers in the interests of the producer.  The\r\nfarmers had lost confidence in the manipulations of the Exchange and\r\nwanted official protection.\r\n\r\nThe question of declaring deals in futures to be a criminal offence was\r\noutside provincial jurisdiction and the farmers withdrew that part of\r\nthe request.  They wished everything else to stand, however.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a recommendation was made that a conference be held\r\nbetween the Government, the Grain Growers, the Exchange, reeves of\r\nmunicipalities, bankers, railroads, etc., for discussion of everything\r\npertaining to the handling of wheat, including amendments to the Grain\r\nExchange charter.  The idea appealed to the Premier and before the\r\nCommittee he pledged that the resolutions passed at the proposed\r\nconference would be converted into legislation.\r\n\r\nAfter adopting the Agricultural Committee's report the Government did\r\nnot act independently regarding the suggested charter amendments, as\r\nthe farmers had hoped they would; instead, the whole thing was shelved,\r\npending the suggested conference.  When this conference was held in the\r\nlatter part of February, however, the Government was duly impressed by\r\nthe earnestness of the Grain Growers.  Many strong speeches were made,\r\nincluding one powerful arraignment by J. W. Scallion, of Virden, whose\r\nenergetic leadership had earned him the title: \"Father of all the Grain\r\nGrowers.\"  The Government promised to amend the Exchange charter at the\r\nnext session of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the Manitoba Grain Growers' Association was putting a\r\nnew face upon the struggle of the Grain Growers' Grain Company for the\r\nrestoration of their trading privileges on the floor of the Exchange.\r\nIt demonstrated that the farmers could act in concert if occasion arose\r\nand that the Grain Growers' Associations were in accord with the\r\nprinciples for which the farmers' trading company was fighting.  When,\r\ntherefore, the Manitoba Association took a hand in the matter by\r\nofficially urging the Manitoba Government to assist in restoring the\r\nCompany to its former position on the Exchange in order that it could\r\nenjoy the rights of the seat for which it had paid, the Government was\r\nforced to take action.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if a Minister of the Crown in Manitoba ever had been\r\ncalled upon to make a more remarkable official statement than that\r\nwhich now appeared in print in connection with this matter.  In the\r\nabsence of Hon. R. P. Roblin it became the duty of the Acting-Premier\r\nto make it.  Hon. Robert Rogers, then Minister of Public Works in the\r\nManitoba Government, was the official head of the Government in the\r\nPremier's absence and in the _Winnipeg Telegram_ of April 4th, 1907,\r\nthe statement appeared as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The action of the Council of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange in refusing\r\ntrading privileges to the Grain Growers' Grain Company is regarded by\r\nthe Government as an arbitrary exercise of the powers conferred upon\r\nthem (the Exchange) through their charter from the Legislative Assembly\r\nof Manitoba, and unless remedied by the Exchange, the Government will\r\ncall the Legislature together during the present month for the purpose\r\nof remedying the conditions by Legislative amendments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 15th the farmers' trading company was admitted once more to\r\nthe full privileges of their seat on the Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe case against the three members of the Grain Exchange, who had been\r\nindicted under Section 498 of the Criminal Code, came to trial in the\r\nAssize Court a week later, on April 22nd, before Judge Phippen.  It was\r\nnow a matter for Crown prosecution and under direction of the\r\nAttorney-General, R. A. Bonnar, K.C., proceeded vigorously.  The Grain\r\nGrowers claimed that the Exchange had rules and regulations which had\r\nbeen carried out in restraint of trade and that in combination with the\r\nNorth-West Grain Dealers' Association there had been a practice of\r\nrestricting the price to be paid for grain to certain daily figures,\r\nsent out by the parties conspiring.\r\n\r\nAlso, they expected to show that there had been a combine in existence\r\nbetween the elevator companies so that there was no competition in the\r\nbuying of grain at certain points while there was an agreement that\r\nonly a certain amount of street wheat would be received at the various\r\nelevators, the whole thing amounting to the restriction of wheat buying\r\nwithin certain limits fixed by the combination of the buyers who\r\nbelonged to the combine--this to the consequent barring out of the\r\nsmall buyer from the trade.  The latter, the Grain Growers argued, was\r\nprevented from buying by the rule which called for the payment of a\r\nsalary to track buyers and prohibited the hiring of men on commission;\r\nthere were points where the quantity of grain offered for sale was too\r\nlimited to justify the payment of a fifty-dollar salary to the buyer.\r\n\r\nAnother point of complaint was that the Grain Exchange membership was\r\nrestricted to three hundred, the members having agreed among themselves\r\nthat no more seats be added although all present seats were sold and\r\nmany more might be sold to eligible citizens.\r\n\r\nAlso, claimed the prosecution, there was a practical boycott of\r\nexpelled members in that the members of the Exchange were forbidden to\r\ndeal with expelled members; it was practically impossible to do\r\nbusiness in grain in Western Canada unless connected with the Grain\r\nExchange, one firm having experienced this difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe rule which barred the purchasing of grain on track during the hours\r\nof trading on the Exchange was, they would endeavor to show, an act in\r\nrestraint of trade and the three men under indictment, the prosecution\r\nhoped to prove, had been active in the enactment of the alleged illegal\r\nby-laws of the Grain Exchange.\r\n\r\nPrior to the enactment of these obnoxious laws of the Exchange the\r\nfarmers had been sought by the buyers, whereas since the rules had been\r\nestablished the farmer must seek the purchaser.  While the prices given\r\nout were fixed by the Grain Exchange in what was claimed to be open\r\ncompetition, the prosecution intended to show that it was a gambling\r\ntransaction pure and simple, the price-fixing being nothing more than\r\nthe guess of the men who acted for their own gain.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted for a month, during which time a great many witnesses\r\nwere examined--grain men and farmers--and the whole grain trade\r\nreviewed.  The array of legal talent for the defence was very imposing\r\nand the case attracted much attention because, aside from its interest\r\nto the grain trade and the farming population, it promised to test the\r\nparticular and somewhat obscure section of the Criminal Code under\r\nwhich the indictment was laid.  At one stage of the proceedings the\r\ntension in court became so high and witnesses so unwilling that upon\r\nreproval by the court regarding his examination, leading counsel for\r\nthe Grain Growers picked up his bag and walked out in protest, willing\r\nto risk punishment for the breach of etiquette rather than remain.\r\nAfter the Grain Growers' executive and counsel had conferred with the\r\nGovernment, however, the Grain Growers' counsel was prevailed upon to\r\nresume the case.\r\n\r\nThe finding of the court did not come as much of a surprise; for it was\r\napparent before the trial ended that the section of the Code was\r\nconsidered ambiguous by the presiding Judge.  The latter held that all\r\nrestraints suggested by the evidence were agreed to, whether\r\njustifiably or not, as business regulations and before finding the\r\ndefendants guilty these restraints must appear to be \"undue,\" according\r\nto his reading of the section.  It was necessary to respect the right\r\nof a particular trade or business or of a particular class of traders\r\nto protect their property by regulations and agreements so long as the\r\npublic interests were not thereby \"unduly\" impaired; to the Judge's\r\nmind there was no question that the public had not been _unduly_\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the case the Judge held that the gravamen of the whole\r\ncharge hung upon the Commission Rule of the Exchange--that one cent\r\ncommission per bushel should be made in handling grain; so that the\r\nprice paid would be the price at the terminal (Fort William) less the\r\nfreight and one cent per bushel commission, neither more nor less.\r\nWitnesses agreed that this was the lowest profit on which the business\r\ncould live.  Fort William prices were the highest the world's markets\r\ncould justify.  Owing to the presence in the statute of the word,\r\n\"unduly,\" therefore, the Judge could not find the defendants guilty.\r\n\r\nThe Grain Growers were much dissatisfied with the decision; for they\r\nbelieved that they had adduced evidence to support their case and did\r\nnot relish losing it on a technicality.  Appeal was made, therefore;\r\nbut the appeal court upheld the judgment of the assize court.\r\n\r\nApparently, deduced the farmers, this meant that men could conspire to\r\ncreate monopolies by driving all competitors out of business so long as\r\nthey did not do it out of pure malice--so long as they justified it on\r\nthe grounds of \"personal interest\"--so long as the things they did were\r\nnot \"malicious restraints, unconnected with any business relations of\r\nthe accused!\"  In other words, if men merely conspired to advance their\r\nown business interests they committed no offence under the then\r\nexisting law; to be liable to punishment they must be actuated by\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\nSo that all the turmoil and talk, court proceedings and conferences,\r\ndeputations and denunciations, evidence and evasions--all the\r\nexcitement of the past few months practically left conditions just\r\nwhere they were.  For the amendments to the Grain Exchange charter\r\nwould not materialize till the Legislature met again next year.\r\n\r\nBut there was one spot where the clouds had rifted and the light shone\r\nthrough.  The Grain Growers' Grain Company had won back its place on\r\nthe Exchange.  More and more the farmers began to pin their faith to\r\ntheir little fighting trading company \"at the front.\"  It appeared to\r\nbe the concentration point for the fire of enemy guns.  In all\r\nprobability hostilities would break out anew, but the men in charge\r\nwere good men--loyal and determined; they could be relied upon to take\r\na full-sized whack at every difficulty which raised its head.\r\n\r\nThe first of these to threaten was on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Now Chief Justice Haultain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPRINTERS' INK\r\n\r\nThe fewer the voices on the side of truth, the more distinct and strong\r\nmust be your own.--_Channing_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the farmers saw it, there was no reason in the world why the bank\r\nshould do what it did.  The Company had closed its first year with net\r\nprofits sufficient to declare a seven per cent. cash dividend and the\r\nprofits would have been augmented greatly had it not been for the heavy\r\ninterest payments which accrued on the unusual overdrafts imposed by\r\nspecial conditions.  In spite of their extremely limited resources and\r\nthe handicaps forced upon them, the volume of business transacted had\r\nexceeded $1,700,000 during the first ten months that the farmers had\r\nbeen in business; their paid-up capital had been approximately eleven\r\nthousand dollars of which over seven thousand had been required for\r\norganization outlay.  The number of shareholders had nearly doubled\r\nduring the ten months and everything was pointing to rapid advancement.\r\nThe Company had been a good customer of the bank, which had received\r\nabout $10,000 in interest.  The security offered for their line of\r\ncredit was unquestioned.\r\n\r\nYet the new directors had scarcely settled into place for the\r\napproaching busy season before, without warning, the bank notified them\r\nthat they wished to close out the account.\r\n\r\nWhen men set themselves up in business they expect to have to compete\r\nfor their share of trade.  The farmers did not expect to find their\r\npath lined with other grain dealers cheering them forward and waving\r\ntheir hats.  They expected competition of the keenest.  What they could\r\nnot anticipate, however, was the lengths to which the fight might go or\r\nthe methods that might be adopted to put their Agency out of business\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nHitherto the grain grower had been in the background when it came to\r\nmarketing and handling grain.  He was away out in the country\r\nsomewhere--busy plowing, busy seeding, busy harvesting, busy\r\nsomething-or-other.  He was a Farm Hand who so \"tuckered himself out\"\r\nduring daylight that he was glad to pry off his wrinkled boots and lie\r\ndown when it got dark in order to yank them on again, when the rooster\r\ncrowed at dawn, for the purpose of \"tuckering himself out\" all over\r\nagain.  It was true that without him there would have been no grain to\r\nhandle; equally true that without the grain dealers the farmer would\r\nhave been in difficulty if he tried to hunt up individual consumers to\r\nbuy his wheat.  The farmer interfering in the established grain trade\r\nwas something new and it was not to be supposed that when the surprise\r\nof it wore off things were not liable to happen.\r\n\r\nThe farmer was quick to infer that the action of the bank in cutting\r\noff the trading company's credit without apparent cause was another\r\nmove of the opposing forces.  It was so palpably a vital spot at which\r\nto strike.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, the threatening cloud evaporated almost as soon as\r\nit appeared.  The manager, W. H. Machaffie, resigned and assumed the\r\nmanagement of another bank.  He was a far-sighted financier, Mr.\r\nMachaffie, and almost the first account he sought for the Home Bank was\r\nthat of the Grain Growers' Grain Company.  The Home Bank was new in the\r\nWest and in the East it had been an old loan company without big\r\ncapitalistic interests, its funds being derived mostly from small\r\ndepositors; but while at that time it was not among the wealthiest\r\nbanking institutions of the country, it was quite able to supply full\r\ncredit facilities.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for the farmers' company and the young bank to get\r\ntogether to mutual advantage was too good to be overlooked.  Under the\r\nbanking laws of Canada valuable special privileges are granted in view\r\nof the important part which the banks play in the country's\r\ndevelopment.  Government returns indicate that the greater part of the\r\nbusiness done by banks is carried on upon their deposits.  If the\r\nworking people and the farmers, as is generally accepted, form the\r\nmajority of these depositors of money in banks, then were not many\r\nloans which went to monopolistic interests being used against the very\r\npeople who furnished the money?  If the farmers could acquire stock in\r\na bank of their own, would they not be in a position to finance their\r\nown requirements rather than those of corporations which might be\r\nobtaining unreasonable profits from the people at large?  Such an\r\ninvestment would be safe and productive at the same time that it\r\nstrengthened the farmers' hands in their effort to do their own trading.\r\n\r\nWith all this in view the directors of the Grain Growers' Grain Company\r\nmade a heavy investment in Home Bank stock and were appointed sole\r\nbrokers to sell a large block of the bank's stock to Western farmers,\r\nworking men and merchants.  On the sale of this they were to receive a\r\ncommission which would, they expected, be enough to cover the expense\r\nof placing the stock.  As the business expanded the Company would be\r\nassured of an extended line of credit as it was needed.\r\n\r\nAnd the business certainly was expanding.  Although the prospects for\r\nthe new crop were not as bright as they had been the year before, a\r\nsubstantial increase in the amount of grain they would handle--owing to\r\nthe increase in the number of shareholders--was anticipated by the\r\nmanagement.  They were not prepared, however, for the heavy volume that\r\npoured in upon them when the crop began to move; it was double that of\r\ntheir first season and the office staff was hard pressed to keep pace\r\nwith the rising work.  There now seemed no reason to believe that the\r\nsuccess of the farmers' venture was any longer in doubt so far as the\r\ncommercial side of it was concerned.\r\n\r\nBut the President and directors had in mind a much broader objective.\r\nIt was not enough that the farmer should receive a few more cents per\r\nbushel for his grain.\r\n\r\n\"We must bear clearly in mind,\" warned T. A. Crerar, \"that there are\r\nstill those interests who would delight in nothing more than in our\r\nfailure and destruction.  A great many improvements require yet to be\r\nmade in our system of handling grain.  The struggle for the bringing\r\nabout of those reforms is not by any means accomplished.  As a great\r\nclass of farmers, composing the most important factor in the progress\r\nand development of our country, we must learn the lesson that we must\r\norganize and work together to secure those legislative and economic\r\nreforms necessary to well-being.  In the day of our prosperity we must\r\nnot forget that there are yet many wrongs to be righted and that true\r\nhappiness and success in life cannot be measured by the wealth we\r\nacquire.  In the mad, debasing struggle for material riches and\r\npleasure, which is so characteristic of our age, we often neglect and\r\nlet go to decay the finer and higher side of our nature and lose\r\nthereby that power of sympathy with our fellows which finds expression\r\nin lending them a helping hand and in helping in every good work which\r\ntends to increase human happiness and lessen human misery.  In keeping\r\nthis in view we keep in mind that high ideal which will make our\r\norganization not alone a material success but also a factor in changing\r\nthose conditions which now tend to stifle the best that is in humanity.\"\r\n\r\nAn important step towards the upholding of these ideals was now taken\r\nby the directors.  The President and the Vice-President happened to be\r\nin a little printshop one day, looking over the proof of a pamphlet\r\nwhich the Company was about to issue, when the former picked up a\r\nlittle school journal which was just off the press for the Teachers'\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\"Why can't we get out a little journal like that?\" he wondered.  \"It\r\nwould be a great help to our whole movement.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Company was approached by a Winnipeg farm paper\r\nwhich devoted a page to the doings of the grain growers.\r\n\r\n\"If you'll help us to get subscriptions amongst the farmers,\" said the\r\npublisher, \"we'll devote more space still to the doings of the grain\r\ngrowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should we build up another man's paper for him?\" argued the\r\nPresident.  \"Why can't we get out a journal for ourselves?\"\r\n\r\nThe idea grew more insistent the longer it was entertained, and\r\nalthough at first E. A. Partridge, who was on the directorate, was\r\nopposed to such a venture, he finally agreed that it would be of untold\r\nassistance to the farmers if they had a paper of their own to voice\r\ntheir ideals.  The logical editor for the new undertaking was E. A.\r\nPartridge, of course, and accordingly he began to gather material for\r\nthe first issue of a paper, to be called the _Grain Growers' Guide_.\r\n\r\nPartridge had a few ideas of his own that had lived with him for a long\r\ntime.  On occasion he had introduced some of them to his friends with\r\ncharacteristic eloquence and the eloquence of E. A. Partridge on a\r\nfavorite theme was something worth listening to; also, he gave his\r\nauditors much to think about and sometimes got completely beyond their\r\ndepth.  It was then that some of them were forced to shake their heads\r\nat theories which appeared to them to be so idealistic that their\r\npractical consummation belonged to a future generation.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this new paper it was Partridge's idea to issue it\r\nas a weekly and as the official organ of the grain growers' trading\r\ncompany instead of the grain growers' movement as a whole.  He thought,\r\ntoo, that it would be advisable to join hands with _The Voice_, which\r\nwas the organ of the Labor unions.  The President and the other\r\nofficers could not agree that any of these was wise at the start; it\r\nwould be better, they thought, to creep before trying to walk, to issue\r\nthe paper as a monthly at first and to have it the official organ of\r\nthe Grain Growers' Associations rather than the trading company alone.\r\n\r\nThis failure of his associates to see the wisdom of his plan to\r\namalgamate with the organ of the Labor unions was a great\r\ndisappointment to Partridge; for he had been working towards this\r\nconsummation for some time, devoutly wished it and considered the time\r\nopportune for such a move.  He believed it to be of vital importance to\r\n\"the Cause\" and its future.  In October he had met with an unfortunate\r\naccident, having fallen from his binder and so injured his foot in the\r\nmachinery that amputation was necessary; he was in no condition to\r\nundertake new and arduous duties in organizing a publishing proposition\r\nas he was still suffering greatly from his injury.  On the verge of a\r\nnervous breakdown, it required only the upsetting of the plans he had\r\ncherished to make him give up altogether and he resigned the editorship\r\nof the new magazine after getting out the first number.\r\n\r\n\"I'm too irritable to get along with anybody in an office,\" he\r\ndeclared.  \"I know I'm impatient and all that, boys.  You'd better send\r\nfor McKenzie to come in from Brandon and edit the paper.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion of his editorial successor seemed to the others to be a\r\ngood one; for Roderick McKenzie had been Secretary of the Manitoba\r\nGrain Growers' Association from the first and had been a prime mover in\r\nits activities as well as wielding considerable influence in the other\r\ntwo prairie provinces where he was well known and appreciated.  He was\r\nwell posted, McKenzie.\r\n\r\nSo the Vice-President wired him to come down to Winnipeg at once.\r\n\r\nYes, he was well posted in the farming business, Rod. McKenzie.  He had\r\nlearned it in the timber country before he took to it in the land of\r\nlong grass.  At eleven years of age he was plowing with a yoke of oxen\r\non the stump lands of Huron, helping his father to scratch a living out\r\nof the bush farm for a family of nine and between whiles attending a\r\nlittle log schoolhouse, going on cedar-gum expeditions, getting lost in\r\nthe bush and indulging in other pioneer pastimes.\r\n\r\nAlong in 1877, when people were talking a lot about Dakota as a farming\r\ncountry, McKenzie took a notion to go West; but he preferred to stay\r\nunder the British flag and Winnipeg was his objective.  A friend of his\r\nwas running a flour-mill at Gladstone (then called Palestine),\r\nManitoba, and young McKenzie decided to take a little walk out that way\r\nto visit him.  It was a wade, rather than a walk!  It was the year the\r\ncountry was flooded and during the first thirty days after his arrival\r\nhe could count only three consecutive days without rain.  In places the\r\nwater was up to his hips and when he reached the flour-mill there was\r\nfour feet of water inside of it.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions were abnormal, of course, and due to lack of settlement\r\nand drainage.  After helping to build the first railway through the\r\ncountry Roderick McKenzie eventually located his farm near Brandon and\r\nso far as the rich land and the climate were concerned he was entirely\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nNot so with the early marketing of his grain, though.  He disposed of\r\ntwo loads of wheat at one of the elevators in Brandon one day and was\r\ngiven a grade and price which he considered fair enough.  When he came\r\nin with two more loads of the same kind of wheat next day, however, the\r\nelevator man told him that he had sent a sample to Winnipeg and found\r\nout that it was not grading the grade he had given him the day before.\r\n\r\n\"The train service wouldn't allow of such fast work, sir,\" said\r\nRoderick McKenzie.  \"I suppose you sent it by wire!\"  He picked up the\r\nreins.  \"That five cents a bushel you want me to give you looks just as\r\ngood in my pocket as in yours.\"\r\n\r\nSo he drove up town where the other buyers were and three of them\r\nlooked at the wheat but refused to give a price for it.  One of them\r\nwas a son of the first elevator man to whom he had gone and, said he:\r\n\r\n\"The Old Man gave you a knockdown for it, didn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're not going to bid against him and if you want to sell it at\r\nall, haul it back to him.\"\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing else he could do under the conditions that\r\nprevailed, McKenzie was forced to pocket his loss without recourse.\r\n\r\nWith such experiences it is scarcely necessary to say that when the\r\ngrain growers' movement started in Manitoba Roderick McKenzie occupied\r\na front seat.  He was singled out at once for a place on the platform\r\nand was elected Secretary of the Brandon branch of the Association.  At\r\nthe annual convention of the Manitoba locals he was made Secretary of\r\nthe Provincial Association, a position which he filled until 1916, when\r\nhe became Secretary of the Canadian Council of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nHis activities in the interests of the Association have made him a\r\nwell-known figure in many circles.  From the first he had been very\r\nmuch in favor of the farmers' trading company and only the restrictions\r\nof his official position with the Association had prevented him from\r\ntaking a more prominent part in its affairs.  As it was, the benefit of\r\nhis experience was frequently sought.\r\n\r\nMcKenzie was plowing in the field when the boy from the telegraph\r\noffice reached him with John Kennedy's message.\r\n\r\n\"They don't say what they want me for; but I guess I'm wanted or they\r\nwouldn't send a telegram--Haw!  Back you!\"  And like Cincinnatus at the\r\ncall of the State in the \"brave days of old,\" McKenzie unhitched the\r\nhorses and leaving the plow where it stood, made for the house, packed\r\nhis grip and caught the next train for Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nJohn Kennedy met him at the station.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" demanded the Secretary of the Manitoba Grain Growers'\r\nAssociation at once.  \"I came right along as soon as I got your wire,\r\nKennedy.  What's up now?\"\r\n\r\n\"The editor of the _Grain Growers' Guide_.  Partridge wants you to take\r\nhis place.\"\r\n\r\n\"ME?  Why, I never edited anything in my life!\" cried McKenzie,\r\nstanding stock still on the platform.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!  Come along,\" laughed Kennedy reassuringly.  \"You'll be\r\nalright.  It ain't hard to do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFROM THE RED RIVER VALLEY TO THE FOOTHILLS\r\n\r\n  It ain't the guns or armament nor the funds that they can pay,\r\n  But the close co-operation that makes them win the day;\r\n  It ain't the individual, nor the army as a whole,\r\n  But the everlastin' team-work of every bloomin' soul!\r\n            --_Kipling_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one of the early grain growers' conventions it had been voiced as an\r\nideal that there were three things which the farmers' movement\r\nneeded--first, a trading company to sell their products (with\r\nultimately, it might be, the cheaper distribution of farm supplies);\r\nsecond, a bank in which they could own stock; third, a paper that would\r\npublish the farmers' views.  So that if the new Executive of the\r\nCompany had done little else than break ground for better financial\r\narrangements and a farmers' own paper, their record for the year would\r\nhave shown progress.\r\n\r\nBut when the second annual meeting of the Company was held they were\r\nable to show that the volume of farmers' grain handled was almost five\r\nmillion bushels, double that of the first year, while the net profits\r\namounted to over thirty thousand dollars.  The number of farmer\r\nshareholders had increased to nearly three thousand with applications\r\non file for another twelve hundred and a steady awakening of interest\r\namong the farmers was to be noticed all over the West.  All this in\r\nspite of the general shortage of money, a reduced total crop yield and\r\nthe keenest competition from rival grain interests.\r\n\r\nIt had been apparent to the directors that if the business grew as\r\nconditions seemed to warrant it doing, it would require to be highly\r\norganized.  Bit by bit the service to the farmer was being widened.\r\nFor instance, the nucleus of a Claims Department had been established\r\nduring the year; for under the laws governing the Canadian railway\r\ncompanies the latter were required to deliver to terminal elevators the\r\namount of grain a farmer loaded into a car and to leave the car in a\r\nsuitable condition to receive grain.  The official weights at the\r\nterminal were unquestioned and if a farmer could furnish reasonable\r\nevidence of the quantity of grain he had loaded, any leakage in transit\r\nwould furnish a claim case against the railway.  During six months the\r\nfarmers' company had collected for its shippers nearly two thousand\r\ndollars in such claims, a beginning sufficient to illustrate that the\r\nCompany was destined to serve the farmers in many practical ways if\r\nthey would only stand behind it.\r\n\r\nIF the farmers would stand behind it!  But would they?  It was a\r\nquestion which was forever popping up to obscure the future.  Many\r\ntongues were busy with inuendo to belittle what the farmers had\r\naccomplished already and to befog their efforts to advance still\r\nfarther.  At every shipping point in the West industrious little\r\nmallets were knocking away on the Xylophone of Doubt, all playing the\r\nsame tune: \"Just Kiss Yourself Good-Bye!\"  No farmers' business\r\norganization ever had been a success in the past and none ever could\r\nbe.  This new trading venture was going to go off with a loud bang one\r\nof these fine days and every farmer who had shipped grain to it would\r\nstand a first-class chance of losing it.  You betcha!  The Grain\r\nGrowers' Associations mightn't be so bad; yes, they'd done some good.\r\nBut this concern in the grain business--run by a few men, wasn't it?\r\nWell, say, does a cat go by a saucer of cream without taking a lick?\r\n\"Farmers' company\" they called it, eh?  Go and tell it to your\r\ngrandmother!\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that in many localities were farmers who believed\r\nthis very suggestion already--that the Company belonged to the men at\r\nthe head of its affairs.  Discouraged by past failures and without much\r\nrespect for the dignity of their occupation, their attitude towards the\r\nCompany was almost automatic.  That it was a great co-operative\r\nmovement of their class, designed to improve economic and social\r\nconditions, was something quite out of their grasp.  And upon these\r\nstrings, already out of tune, elevator men strummed diligently in an\r\neffort to create discord.\r\n\r\nFrom the first it had been like that.  Friends who would speak a good\r\nword for the struggling venture at the time it was most needed were\r\nabout as scarce as horns on a horse.  On the other hand the organizers\r\nran across \"the knockers\" at every turn.  A traveller for one of the\r\nmilling companies, for instance, happened to get into conversation on\r\nthe train with E. A. Partridge one day.  The latter was a stranger to\r\nhim and he naturally supposed he was talking to \"just a farmer.\"  The\r\nsubject of conversation was the grain trade and this traveller began to\r\nmake a few remarks about the \"little grain company\" that had started up.\r\n\r\n\"What about that company?\" asked Partridge with visible interest.\r\n\"I've heard a lot about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's just a little dinky affair,\" laughed the traveller.  \"They've\r\ngot a little office about ten feet square and they actually have a\r\ntypewriter!  They get a car or two a month.  Don't amount to anything.\"\r\n\r\nFor a full hour he kept the chutes open and filled his interested\r\nauditor with all the latest brands of misrepresentation and ridicule.\r\nHe explained why it was that the farmers' effort was nothing but a joke\r\nand how foolish it would be for any farmer to send business to it.  He\r\nwas a good salesman, this traveller, and he was sure he had \"sold\" this\r\nrather intelligent hayseed when he got to the end of his talk and his\r\nstation was called.\r\n\r\n\"I've really enjoyed this,\" assured Partridge gratefully.  \"As a farmer\r\nI'm naturally interested in that sort of thing, you know, and I've got\r\na particular interest in that little grain company.  My name is\r\nPartridge and I only want to say----\"\r\n\r\nBut the traveller had grabbed his club bag and was off down the aisle\r\nas fast as he could go.  Salesmanship is punctuated by \"psychological\r\nmoments\" and good salesmen always know when to leave.  He did not look\r\naround.  His ears were very red.\r\n\r\nIt was funny.  No, it wasn't, either!  Lies about the Company, thought\r\nthe then President, would travel a thousand miles before the Truth\r\ncould get its boots on!  It was not a matter for amusement at all.\r\n\r\nAs the \"little dinky affair\" became a competitor of increasing strength\r\nin the grain trade the efforts of a section of the grain men,\r\nparticularly the elevator interests, to discredit it among the farmers\r\nbecame more and more marked.  While the farmers' company was not openly\r\nattacked, influences nevertheless were constantly at work to undermine\r\nin roundabout ways.  The elevator men were in a strong position to\r\nfight hard and they pressed every advantage.  At practically every\r\nshipping point they had agents whose business it was to secure\r\nshipments of grain in car lots as well as buying on street.  Many of\r\nthese men were very popular locally and as individuals were good\r\nfellows, well liked by their farmer friends.  A rebate on the charges\r\nfor loading grain through an elevator or the mere fact that letting the\r\nelevator have it saved the bother of writing a letter--these were\r\nexcellent inducements to the unthinking farmer, and when added to this\r\nwas the element of personal acquaintance with the buyer, it was hard to\r\nrefuse.\r\n\r\nFor your farmer is a man of simple code.  He is not versed in\r\nsubterfuge and diplomacy.  He takes words at their face value, unless\r\nhe distrusts you, just as he hands them out himself.  He lives a clean,\r\nhonest life and earns his money.  If in some cases his viewpoint is\r\nnarrowed by treading much in the same furrows, it is at least an honest\r\nviewpoint in which he really believes.  And one of the things in which\r\nthe average farmer prides himself is that he will \"never go back on a\r\nfriend.\"  Even a red Indian would not do that!\r\n\r\nIn selling to the elevator these same farmers probably had no intention\r\nof unfriendliness to the farmers' trading company.  They hoped to see\r\nit succeed but did not appreciate their individual responsibility in\r\nthe matter or realize that while their own personal defection\r\nrepresented a loss to the Company of just one shipment, the loss became\r\nvital when multiplied many times all along the line.  And the Company\r\nhad no agent on the ground to argue this out, face to face.\r\n\r\nAlthough many requests for the appointment of such local agents reached\r\nthe office, the directors decided that it would be poor policy as it\r\nwould mean appointing agents everywhere and abuses might develop.  It\r\nwould be easy under such a system for an impression to get abroad that\r\nfavoritism was being shown in appointments; jealousies and\r\ndisappointments might be the result.  On the other hand, one of the\r\ngreatest sources of strength which the Company could foster would be a\r\nsense of individual responsibility among its farmer shareholders--each\r\nshareholder an agent for his own grain and that of his non-member\r\nneighbors, each doing his part to keep down the handling cost of his\r\ngrain and build up his own company.  In the meantime it were better to\r\nlose some grain than run the risk of disrupting the whole movement--to\r\nlet the elevators enjoy their advantage until it became a nullity by\r\neducation of the farmer himself.\r\n\r\nSuch educational work was already a regular part of the routine.\r\nPamphlets and circulars were issued from time to time, dealing with\r\nprevailing conditions, advocating amendments to the Grain Act, etc.,\r\nand explaining the need for government ownership of elevators.  The\r\nfeeling that the Provincial governments should acquire and operate all\r\nstorage facilities in the way of elevators and warehouses was spreading\r\nrapidly among farmers and business men.\r\n\r\nIn the second year the Grain Growers' Grain Company began to export\r\nseveral small shipments, more for the sake of the experience than\r\nanything else.  A very extensive line of credit was necessary to go\r\ninto the export business and, until the arrangement with the Home Bank\r\ndeveloped this, their hands were tied in the matter of exporting for\r\nthemselves.  Their third year in business, though, found their\r\nfinancial relations so improved that they were able to do a\r\nconsiderable and profitable business in the exporting of grain, thereby\r\nadvancing definitely towards one objective which the farmers had had\r\nfrom the first.  Most of the grain which the Company handled in this\r\nway was sold to exporters in the Eastern States and in Eastern Canada,\r\nthis method being found more satisfactory than selling direct to buyers\r\nin the Old Country at this time.\r\n\r\nIn spite of everything, therefore, things were swinging the farmers'\r\nway.  The whole Farmers' Movement was expanding, solidifying,\r\nparticularly in Alberta, which for so long had been primarily a cattle\r\ncountry.  Grain production was now increasing rapidly in this Province\r\nof the Foothills and Chinooks and the future shipment of Alberta grain\r\nto the Pacific Coast and thence via the new Panama Canal route was a\r\nlive topic.  Owing to special conditions prevailing in the farthest\r\nwest of the three Prairie Provinces the Grain Growers' movement there\r\ndid not solidify until 1909 into its final cohesion under the name,\r\n\"United Farmers of Alberta.\"\r\n\r\nPrior to this the farmers of Alberta had been organized into two\r\ngroups--the Canadian Society of Equity and the Alberta Farmers'\r\nAssociation.  The first had its beginnings among some farmers from the\r\nUnited States--mostly from Nebraska and Dakota--who settled near\r\nEdmonton and who in their former home had been members of the American\r\nSociety of Equity.  These farmers in 1904-5 organized some branches of\r\nthe American Society after arrival in the new land and, becoming\r\nambitious, formed the Canadian Society of Equity with the idea of\r\nowning and controlling their own flour and lumber mills and what not.\r\nFor this Purpose they got together a concern called \"The Canadian\r\nSociety of Equity, Limited,\" and bought a timber limit, so called.\r\nThey secured shareholders in all parts of Alberta and the concern went\r\nto smash in 1907, this unfortunate failure making doubly shy those\r\nfarmers who had been bitten.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1905, the members of the local branch of the American\r\nSociety of equity which had been established at Clover Bar had reached\r\nthe conclusion that the work of the Society did not meet the\r\nrequirements of conditions in Alberta and that it was not desirable to\r\nhave the farmers of the province organized into two camps--the Society\r\nof Equity on one hand and the Alberta branches of the Territorial Grain\r\nGrowers' Association on the other.  Especially now that the Territories\r\nwere to be established into the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta,\r\nit was desirable that reorganization and a change of name take place.\r\nAccordingly the Clover Bar branch of the American Society of Equity and\r\nthe Strathcona branch of the Territorial Grain Growers' Association got\r\ntheir heads together on a proposal to amalgamate into one farmers'\r\norganization under the name, Alberta Farmers' Association.\r\n\r\nUnder the impression that this was a veiled scheme of the Grain Growers\r\nto swallow their organization whole, the Society of Equity turned down\r\nthe idea of amalgamation.  The Clover Bar farmers withdrew from the\r\nSociety and joined the Strathcona Grain Growers in forming the nucleus\r\nof a provincial farmers' association as planned.\r\n\r\nOwing to the mixed nature of Alberta's agricultural population and to\r\nthe general distrust of farmers' organizations the new Alberta Farmers'\r\nAssociation faced a difficult situation.  But the principles laid down\r\nby their leaders were so fair, so sane and broad-minded, that in two\r\nyears the Association became an influence in almost every line of trade\r\nin the province.  They organized a very successful seed fair, a feature\r\nof which was a meeting to discuss improvement of the market for live\r\nstock, especially hogs; this resulted in the appointment of a Pork\r\nCommission.  At their convention in 1906 the Association took stand on\r\nsuch important matters as the special grading of Alberta Hard Winter\r\nWheat, the establishment of a terminal elevator at the Pacific Coast,\r\nof a pork-packing and beef-chilling plant by the Provincial Government,\r\netc.  In the discussion of everything affecting the welfare of the\r\nfarmers the Association played an important part and it was at their\r\nrequest that the Provincial Government sent an agent to investigate the\r\nmarkets of British Columbia with the idea of closer relations.\r\n\r\nA second attempt to amalgamate with the Canadian Society of Equity,\r\nwhich had succeeded the American Society, had fallen through and there\r\nwere still two farmers' organizations in the Province of Alberta.\r\nHowever, with the progress being made with the Provincial Government in\r\nconnection with the pork-packing and beef-chilling plant and with the\r\nDominion Government in regard to government ownership of terminal\r\nelevators, the farmers as a whole began to see the need of closer\r\nunion.  Such wide measures as a system of government-owned internal\r\nelevators were bringing the farmers of all three Western provinces into\r\ncloser conference and in 1908 the feeling in favor of amalgamation of\r\nall Alberta farmers into one organization began to crystallize.\r\n\r\nFinally in September a conference was held between representatives of\r\nthe Alberta Farmers' Association and the Canadian Society of Equity.\r\nThe constitution drafted at this conference was submitted to the annual\r\nconventions of both bodies at Edmonton on January 13th, 1909.  The\r\nfollowing morning the delegates of the Canadian Society of Equity\r\nmarched from their hall to the convention of the Alberta Farmers'\r\nAssociation and amid great cheers the two became one under the name,\r\nUnited Farmers of Alberta, with \"Equity\" as their motto, and with a\r\nstrong coalition directorate.[1]\r\n\r\nUntil now each of the organizations had had its separate official\r\norgan; but on amalgamation these were dropped and the _Grain Growers'\r\nGuide_ adopted as the official organ for Alberta.  First published\r\nunder the auspices of the Manitoba Grain Growers' Association, the\r\n_Guide_ now represented the farmers' movement in all three provinces.\r\nThe wisdom of its establishment was being proved steadily.  Its\r\ncirculation was gathering momentum with every issue.  It was now coming\r\nout as a weekly and its pages were filled with valuable information for\r\nthe farmer on every subject dealing with the marketing of his produce.\r\nAlso it was proving a wonderful educator on such large questions as\r\ngovernment ownership of elevators, the tariff, control of public\r\nservice corporations and so forth.  The farmer was getting information\r\nwhich he had never been able to obtain before and he was getting it\r\nwithout distortion, uncolored by convenient imagination, plain as Fact\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAn up-to-date printing plant had been installed to print the _Guide_\r\nand do a general job-printing business, and this was organized as a\r\nseparate company under the name of the \"Public Press, Limited.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to all the difficulties which usually attend the building\r\nof a publishing enterprise to success, the farmers' own journal had to\r\nface many more which were due to the special nature of its policies.\r\nManufacturers who disapproved of its attitude on the tariff, for\r\ninstance, refused for a long while to use its advertising columns.\r\nEach year as the _Guide's_ struggle went on there was an annual deficit\r\nand had it not been for the grants with which the Grain Growers' Grain\r\nCompany came to its rescue, the paper must have gone under.  For this\r\nfinancial assistance the farmers' trading company got no return except\r\nthe satisfaction of knowing that the money could not be spent to better\r\nadvantage in the interests of Western farmers.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid developments in Alberta and the probable future shipment\r\nof Alberta grain via the Panama Canal route, branch offices were being\r\nopened at Calgary by Winnipeg grain dealers.  Not to be behind in the\r\nmatter of service, the farmers' company followed suit.  A Seed Branch\r\nDepartment to supply good seed grain was another improvement in service\r\nand the farmers by this time were taking a keen interest in their\r\ntrading organization.\r\n\r\nWhen the third annual meeting came around, there was no longer any\r\ndoubt that a farmers' business organization _could_ succeed--that this\r\nventure of the Grain Growers was _not_ going to go off with a loud\r\nbang--at least, not yet.\r\n\r\nBut, as the President remarked, it seemed that they had no more than\r\ntouched the fringe of what remained to be accomplished.  One of the\r\nimmediate questions pressing for solution, he considered, was\r\ngovernment ownership of elevators.\r\n\r\n\"Our Company's experience has demonstrated completely,\" he said, \"that\r\nour grain marketing conditions can never reach a proper basis as long\r\nas the elevators necessary for that marketing are allowed to remain in\r\nprivate hands for private gain.  The Grain Growers' Associations are\r\nthe one thing above everything else that stands between the farmer and\r\nthe power of merciless corporations.  They have undoubtedly been the\r\ngreatest shield this Company has had since its organization; they have\r\nhelped the Company to prove, far beyond any question of doubt, the\r\nadvantages of co-operation.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what had the elevator men to say about all this?  Surely these\r\nfarmers were becoming a menace!  At the present rate of speed another\r\nthree years would see them in control of the grain business and was\r\nthat good for the grain business?  Was it good for the farmer?  The\r\nelevator men did not think so.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, they were not worrying greatly about government\r\nownership.  They were more interested in the fact that the volume of\r\ngrain which had flowed so faithfully all these years was being split up\r\nby all these commission men--these hangers-on who invested little or no\r\ncapital but necked right up to the profits of the trade as if they\r\nowned the whole business!\r\n\r\nTrouble was brewing on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange--had been for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThen one day word reached the office of the Grain Growers' Grain\r\nCompany that by a majority vote the Grain Exchange had suspended, for a\r\nperiod of one year, the Commission Rule under which grain was handled.\r\n\r\nThus did things come to a showdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix--Par. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SHOWDOWN\r\n\r\n  It's scarcely in a body's power\r\n  Tae keep at times frae being sour\r\n  Tae see how things are shared.\r\n            --_Robert Burns_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fight was on between the elevator interests and the commission\r\nmerchants of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange--a fight for existence.  For,\r\nwith the Commission Rule of the Exchange eliminated, those firms which\r\nhandled grain on a straight commission basis would be forced to meet\r\nthe competition of the elevator buyers and the chances were they would\r\nbe forced to handle grain at a loss; the best they could hope for would\r\nbe to cover their costs.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that this Commission Rule, established in 1899,\r\nwas that a charge of one cent commission per bushel should be made for\r\nhandling grain and that all members of the Exchange dealing in grain\r\nmust show that the price paid was the price at the terminal (Fort\r\nWilliam) less the freight and one cent per bushel commission.  This\r\ncommission could be neither more nor less than one cent; for at that\r\ntime it was felt that business could not be done, offices maintained\r\nand an efficient and reliable service given for less.  It was a charge\r\nwhich both farmers and grain men considered fair and reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe trouble in the Exchange started when the commission men claimed the\r\nright to have country agents and to pay them on a commission basis of\r\none-quarter cent per bushel.  The elevator companies were able to buy\r\nat elevator points through their salaried representatives but the\r\ncommission men were prohibited from having country agents except on a\r\nsalary basis, and this they could not afford, handling grain on\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nFor some years past there had been considerable dissatisfaction among\r\nExchange members in regard to the operation of the Commission rule,\r\ndoubt being entertained that all the members were keeping good faith in\r\nthe collection of the full commission charge of one cent to non-members\r\nof the Exchange and one-half cent per bushel to members on country\r\nconsigned and purchased grain.  Although the Council of the Exchange\r\nhad held many special meetings in an endeavor to find a remedy and to\r\ninvestigate the charges, the results had not been very marked owing to\r\nthe difficulty of securing the evidence to support such charges.\r\n\r\nThis was given as a reason for the doing away with the one cent\r\ncommission restriction altogether for a trial period of one year.\r\nThereby the trade was put on a \"free for all\" basis, as the President\r\nof the Exchange then in office pointed out.  It meant that Exchange\r\nmembers were \"enabled to pay owners of grain in the country any price\r\nthey desired without regard to actual market values as regularly\r\nestablished on the floor of the Exchange.\"  It was the personal opinion\r\nof the President that to preserve stable markets with uniformity and\r\ndiscipline amongst Exchange members a commission rule was absolutely\r\nnecessary and he predicted that perhaps in a short while, after the\r\nsuspension of the Commission Rule had been given a fair trial, the\r\nExchange might see its way clear to rescind the suspension.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" nodded the commission men among themselves.  \"The logical\r\nand certain result will be the weeding out of the commission men and\r\ntrack buyers, who give practically the only element of competition that\r\nexists in the trade!  One of the curses of our Canadian commercialism\r\nis the strong tendency to monopoly and this looks like an effort to\r\ncreate an absolute elevator monopoly of the grain trade, which is the\r\nstaple industry of the country.\"\r\n\r\nBut if the small dealers on the Exchange were aroused, what about the\r\nfarmers' trading company?  They did business on a commission basis only\r\nand with the elevators offering to handle the farmers' grain for\r\nnothing, or next door to it, what would happen?  Would the farmer be\r\n\"unable to see past his nose,\" as was predicted?  Would he forget the\r\nconditions of the early days and grab for a present saving of five or\r\nten dollars per car?  If the farmers did not stand together now, they\r\nwere licked!  It was a showdown.\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing to do--take a referendum of the shareholders\r\nas to the basis on which they wished the year's business handled.  The\r\nBoard of Control of the Grain Growers' Grain Company therefore issued\r\nthe following circular letter, which was mailed to every farmer\r\nshareholder:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This matter we now bring to your notice is the most important yet.\r\n\r\n\"At a meeting of the Grain Exchange, held a few days ago, the\r\nCommission Rule was suspended for a year.  This means that there is no\r\nfixed charge for handling grain, and any company or firm can, if they\r\nwish, handle car lots for nothing.  How did this come about?  The\r\nElevator Companies did it with the aid of Bank Managers and other\r\nWinnipeg men outside of the Grain Trade, who hold seats on the\r\nExchange, and voted with them.  The intention of these Elevator\r\nCompanies is to handle all grain for 1/2c. per bushel or for nothing in\r\norder to take it away from the Commission Men, who have no elevators,\r\nand especially to keep it away from the Grain Growers' Grain Company.\r\n\r\n\"The Elevator Companies can handle farmers' cars for nothing and still\r\nnot lose anything.  How?  In four ways--\r\n\r\n\"1st.  They all buy street grain and the immense profits they make on\r\nthis will make up for any loss they have in handling cars for nothing.\r\n\r\n\"2nd.  The dockage they get on street grain and on car lots passed\r\nthrough their elevators helps them.\r\n\r\n\"3rd.  The charges on the cars loaded through their elevators helps\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"4th.  When they get your car it is sent to their own terminal\r\nelevator, and they earn the storage on it there which is very\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n\"The commission man, such as ourselves, has none of these things to\r\nfall back on.  His profit is what is left out of the cent a bushel\r\ncommission after all expenses such as rent, taxes, insurance, wages for\r\noffice help, telegrams, telephone, etc., are paid.\r\n\r\n\"The Elevator Combine know this.  They know the weakness of the\r\ncommission dealers' position and the strength of their own, and knowing\r\nit, deliberately cut out the commission and will offer to handle the\r\nfarmers' grain for nothing in order to put the only opposition they\r\nhave out of business.  And mark you! this is aimed at our company more\r\nthan any other, though we believe they are after all commission\r\ndealers.  Some of them have said so.  They want to kill us and they\r\nthink they have at last found a way.  Their dodge is simple.  By\r\nhandling cars for half a cent or nothing, they are going to bribe the\r\nfarmers and our own shareholders to send cars away from us, and by\r\nkeeping grain from us help to kill us and plant us that deep we shall\r\nnever come up again.\r\n\r\n\"In this way they hope to 'rule the roost' and get back the good old\r\ndays they had ten or twelve years ago.\r\n\r\n\"Can they succeed?  It depends on the men who ship the grain.  If they\r\nsupport the combine by giving the elevators (or the commission houses\r\nthat work for the elevators under a different name) their cars, they\r\nmay soon expect to find themselves in a worse position than they have\r\never been before.\r\n\r\n\"As a prominent commission man said the other day, 'The elevator\r\ncompanies are asking the farmers to help at their own funeral.'  It is\r\nan anxious time for our own company.  We have shown that with anything\r\nlike fair play it may succeed.  We have been growing stronger and, we\r\nbelieve, doing some good.  Are our shareholders and friends going to\r\ntake the bribe that is meant to put us out of business?  We hope and\r\nbelieve not.  For this reason we are taking a referendum vote of our\r\nshareholders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at this crisis that the _Grain Growers' Guide_ had an\r\nopportunity of demonstrating its value to the farmers as a fighting\r\nweapon.  It seized the cudgels and waded right into the thick of the\r\ncontroversy without fear or favor.  It came out flat-footed in its\r\ncharges against the elevator interests and emphasized the warning of\r\nthe Company in language that carried no double meaning.\r\n\r\n\"We have no quarrel with the Winnipeg Grain Exchange as an Exchange,\"\r\nsaid the _Guide_.  \"It is a convenience for gathering reports from\r\nother parts of the world, market conditions, and for drafting rules\r\nthat facilitate and simplify business dealings.\r\n\r\n\"As we have often pointed out, however, the Exchange is being used by\r\nthe Elevator Interests that seem to dominate it, to further their own\r\nparticular ends with the result that the nefarious methods of the\r\nElevator Trust bring suspicion and condemnation upon the Exchange and\r\nits members.\r\n\r\n\"The demand for the Royal Grain Commission arose from the methods\r\npursued by the Elevator Companies in dealing with the farmers at\r\ncountry points.  The pooling of receipts at country points is not\r\nforgotten by the farmers; heavy dockage and unfair grading and low\r\nprices paid when the farmers were compelled to sell and could not help\r\nthemselves, are also not forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"Every injustice and disturbance in the trade that has taken place\r\nsince grain commenced to be marketed in Manitoba, can be traced to the\r\nElevator Monopoly.\r\n\r\n\"The farmers of this country owe nothing to the Elevator Trust and we\r\nhave confidence enough in them to believe that they will not be bought\r\nover by them now.  The Commission Men and Track Buyers certainly owe\r\nnothing to this trust either.  They have helped in the past to carry\r\nthe suspicion and sin arising from its methods and it commences to look\r\nas if they were getting tired of carrying the load.\"\r\n\r\nColumn after column of such plain talk was given place in the _Guide_\r\nweek after week, together with reports of Grain Exchange proceedings,\r\ninterviews with commission men and elevator men, pronouncements of\r\nGrain Exchange officials and comment upon pamphlets circulated amongst\r\nthe farmers by the North-West Grain Dealers' Association, etc.\r\nEverything having a bearing upon the situation was brought to light and\r\nanalyzed.  Letters from farmers throughout the country were published\r\nas fast as they reached the editor's desk, and they were coming pretty\r\nfast, about as fast as the mail could bring them.\r\n\r\nThey were reaching the office of the farmers' trading company by the\r\nbagful.  The Company had asked three definite questions of the farmers\r\nin connection with the commission to be charged on grain shipped to the\r\nCompany--whether or not the old rate should be maintained in spite of\r\nthe action of the Exchange; whether the commission should be reduced;\r\nwhether the whole matter should be left to the discretion of the\r\ndirectors.  The letters poured in by the thousand and only two per\r\ncent. of the farmers recommended any reduction in the rates; of the\r\nremainder, seventy per cent. were in favor of the Company maintaining\r\nthe one cent commission and the other twenty-eight per cent. were\r\nwilling to abide by the decision of the directors.\r\n\r\nThe comments contained in some of these letters revealed strong\r\nfeeling.  Many farmers were ready to pay two cents commission per\r\nbushel if necessary, rather than sell to \"the monopolies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will pledge myself to ship every bushel of grain I grow to the\r\nFarmers' Company,\" wrote one, \"even though the directors found it\r\nnecessary to charge me five cents per bushel, coin.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they cauna draw the blinds ower the daylights o' a Scotchman,\"\r\nassured one old son of the heather.  \"I am verra pleased to leave the\r\nhale concern in your hands as I do believe you are thoroughly plumb and\r\nalways square.\"\r\n\r\nWith this encouragement the directors announced that they would\r\ncontinue to charge a commission of one cent per bushel on wheat shipped\r\nto them, just as if the Commission Rule had not been suspended by the\r\nExchange.  Other commission merchants, they knew, intended to reduce\r\ntheir charges to half a cent per bushel; the elevator men, they\r\nexpected, would handle the grain for the same and in many cases for\r\nnothing in order to persuade the farmers to ship their way.  It would\r\nbe a great temptation to many farmers who had been sitting on the\r\nfence, shouting \"Sic 'em!\" but never lifting a little finger to help,\r\nand it was to be expected that those with limited vision would ship\r\ntheir grain where they could make the biggest saving at the time.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, the directors believed that the majority of the\r\nfarmers would not prove one cent wise and many dollars foolish by\r\nfailing to realize what the future might hold in store if the elevators\r\nsucceeded in killing off competition.  Finding that it was possible to\r\nhandle oats on a smaller margin, they made the farmers a gift reduction\r\nof half a cent per bushel on oat shipments; otherwise the former rate\r\nwas sustained.\r\n\r\nThe wheat ripened.  Harvesting began.  The long grain trains commenced\r\nto drag into Winnipeg across the miles of prairie.  By the middle of\r\nSeptember the weekly receipts of the farmers' company were running to\r\n744 cars.  In 1907 they had handled about five per cent. of the crop\r\nand seven and one-half per cent. of the 1908 crop; of the total number\r\nof cars so far inspected in this year of \"free for all\" methods, the\r\nGrain Growers' Grain Company handled about fifteen per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen the end of the season brought the figures to a final total it was\r\nfound that the farmers' organization had handled well over sixteen\r\nmillion bushels of farmers' grain.  This was an increase over the\r\npreceding year of nearly nine million bushels, or 114 per cent.  It was\r\nnearly one and one-half million bushels greater than all the previous\r\nyears of operation and represented one-eighth of all the grain\r\ninspected during the year in Western Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS MR. \"OBSERVER\"\r\n\r\nObservation tells me that you have a little reddish mold adhering to\r\nyour instep. . . .  So much is observation.  The rest is deduction.\r\n            --_Sherlock Holmes_.\r\n              _Sign of Four (Doyle)_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Prehistoric Days, when one man hied himself from his cave to impress\r\nhis ideas upon another the persuasion used took the form of a wallop on\r\nthe head with a stone axe.  It was the age of Individual Opinion.  But\r\nas Man hewed his way upward along Time's tangled trails personal\r\nopinions began to jog along together in groups, creating Force.  With\r\nthe growth of populations and the invention of printing this power was\r\ncalled Public Opinion and experience soon taught the folly of ignoring\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the course of human aspiration Somebody who had a Bright Mind got\r\nthe notion that in order to get his own way without fighting the crowd\r\nall he had to do was to educate the \"Great Common Pee-pul\" to his way\r\nof thinking and by sowing enough seed in public places up would come\r\nwhatever kind of crop he wanted.  Thus, by making Public Opinion\r\nhimself he would avoid the hazard of opposing it.  The name of this\r\nSagacious Pioneer of Special Privilege who manufactured the first\r\ncarload of Public Opinion is lost to posterity; all that is known about\r\nhim is that he was a close student of the Art of concealing Artifice by\r\nArtlessness and therefore wore gum rubbers on his feet and carried\r\naround a lot of Presents to give away.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible to direct the thought of Tom-Dick-and-Harry.  A\r\nskillful orator can swing a crowd from laughter to anger and back\r\nagain.  The politician who prepares a speech for a set occasion builds\r\nhis periods for applause with every confidence.  But it was to the\r\npublic prints that they who sought the manufacture of Public Opinion\r\nwere in the habit of turning.\r\n\r\nThere has always been something very convincing about \"cold print.\"\r\nThe little boy believes that the cow really did jump over the moon; for\r\nisn't it right there in the nursery book with a picture of her doing\r\nit?  And despite the disillusionments of an accelerated age many\r\nreaders still cherish an old-time faith in their favorite newspaper--a\r\nfaith which is a relic of the days when the freedom of the press was a\r\nnew and sacred heritage and the public bought the paper to learn what\r\nJoseph Howe, George Brown, Franklin, Greeley or Dana thought about\r\nthings.  This period gave place gradually to the great modern\r\nnewspaper, the product in some cases of a publishing company so\r\n\"limited\" that it thought mostly in terms of dollars and cents and\r\npolitical preferments.\r\n\r\nWhen the cub reporter rushed in to his city editor with eyes sparkling\r\nhe cried out enthusiastically:\r\n\r\n\"Gee, I've got a peach of a story!  Old John Smith's daughter's eloped\r\nwith the chauffeur.  She's a movie fan and----\"\r\n\r\nBut it did not get into the paper for the very good reason that \"Old\r\nJohn\" was the proprietor of the big departmental store which took a\r\nfull-page advertisement in every issue the year around.  The editor\r\nwould have used it soon enough, but--the business office--!\r\n\r\nThen there was the theatrical press-agent, a regular caller with his\r\nadvance notices and free electros of coming attractions, his press\r\npasses.\r\n\r\n\"Give us a chance, old man,\" he pleaded, perhaps laying down a good\r\ncigar.  \"Say, that was a rotten roast you handed us last week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it was a rotten show!\" the editor would retort.  \"I saw it\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nThe telephone rings, maybe--the business office again.\r\n\r\n\"The Blank Theatre have doubled their space with us, Charlie.  Go easy\r\non 'em for awhile, will you?\"\r\n\r\nThe floor around the editor's desk was scuffed by the timid boots of\r\nthe man who wanted his name kept out of the paper and the sure tread of\r\nthe corporation representative who wanted his company's name mentioned\r\non every possible occasion.  Business interests, railway corporations,\r\nfinancial institutions--many of these had a regular department for the\r\npurpose of supplying \"news\" to the press.  Some American railroads\r\nfinally took to owning a string of papers outright, directly or\r\nindirectly, and one big Trust went so far as to control a telegraphic\r\nnews service.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to such a pass did things come in the United States that the\r\nexploitation of the press became a menace to public interest and a law\r\nwas passed, requiring every publication to register the name of its\r\nproprietor; in the case of corporate ownerships the names of the\r\nshareholders had to be filed and the actual owners of stock held in\r\ntrust had to be named also.  This information had to be printed in\r\nevery issue and the penalties for suppression or falsification were\r\ndrastic.\r\n\r\nNo such law was passed in Canada, although the reflection of the\r\nsituation in the United States cast high lights and shadows across the\r\nnorthern boundary.  Partizan politics were rife in Canada and too often\r\nhave party \"organs\" and \"subsidies\" dampered down the fires of\r\nindependence in the past.  A few journals, however, even in the days\r\nbefore the great changes of the War, placed a jealous guard upon their\r\nabsolute freedom from trammelling influences and to-day they reap the\r\nreward of public confidence.\r\n\r\nWhile not a newspaper, the _Grain Growers' Guide_ was a highly\r\nspecialized journal for the Western farmer, aiming frankly at educating\r\nhim to be the owner of his land, his produce, his self-respect and his\r\nfranchise; to make him self-thinking and self-reliant and to defend him\r\nfrom unjust slurs.\r\n\r\nThe editorial responsibility of carrying out such a programme in the\r\nface of existing conditions required a well chosen staff.  In Roderick\r\nMcKenzie, then Secretary of the Manitoba Grain Growers' Association,\r\nthe farmers had an editor upon whose viewpoint they could depend; for\r\nhe was one of themselves.  But lacking practical experience in\r\nnewspaper work, it was necessary to secure an Associate Editor who\r\nwould figure largely in the practical management of the publication.\r\nMcKenzie was finding that his duties as Secretary of the Association\r\nwere becoming too heavy for him to attempt editorial services as well;\r\nso that not long after the appointment of an Associate Editor he\r\ndecided to devote his whole time to his official duties.\r\n\r\nIn its selection of a young man to take hold the _Guide_ was fortunate.\r\nGeorge Fisher Chipman was not only a very practical newspaper man to\r\nmeet the immediate needs of the young journal, but he was capable of\r\nexpanding rapidly with his opportunities.  Well versed in the economic\r\nproblems of the day, he was known already in many magazine offices as a\r\nreliable contributor upon current topics.  He was well poised and, as\r\nlegislative reporter for the _Manitoba Free Press_, Chipman had made\r\nsomething of a reputation for himself on both sides of the political\r\nfence as a man who endeavored to be fair and who upheld at all times\r\nthe traditional honor of the press.\r\n\r\nBy training and inclination Chipman was in complete sympathy with the\r\nFarmers' Movement in Western Canada.  Away east, in the Valley of\r\nEvangeline, near Grand Pré, Nova Scotia, he was brought up on a farm,\r\nlearning the farmers' viewpoint as afterwards he came to know that of\r\nthe big men in the cities.  He believed in co-operation, his father\r\nhaving been a leader in every farmers' organization in Nova Scotia for\r\nmore than twenty years.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the young editor's influence made itself\r\nmanifest in the official paper of the Western farmers.  He saw many\r\nways of improving it and organizing it for the widest possible service\r\nin its field.  Editorially he believed in calling a spade a spade and,\r\nbeing free from political restrictions, Chipman did not hesitate to\r\n\"get after\" politicians of all stripes whenever their actions seemed to\r\nprovide fit subject for criticism.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Commission Rule difficulty arose the _Guide_ had\r\nincreased its weekly circulation by many thousands.  The new editor\r\nseized the opportunity for \"active service\" and waged an effective\r\ncampaign.  The Grain Exchange finally restored the One-Cent Commission\r\nRule and never since has it been dropped.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, hostilities broke out anew in an unexpected\r\ndirection.  They took the form of \"letters\" to the press and they began\r\nto appear in five papers which were published in Winnipeg--two\r\nnewspapers and three farm journals.  Concealing his identity under the\r\n_nom-de-plume_, \"Observer,\" the writer attacked the Grain Growers'\r\nGrain Company and the men at the head of it.  Declaring himself to be a\r\nfarmer, Mr. \"Observer\" endeavored to discredit the farmers' trading\r\norganization by casting suspicion upon its motives and methods of\r\nbusiness.  As letter followed letter it became evident that the object\r\nin view was to stir up discontent among the farmers with the way their\r\nown agency was being conducted.\r\n\r\nAfter issuing a single, dignified and convincing refutation of these\r\nattacks, the Company ignored the anonymous enemy.  But the gauntlet was\r\npicked up by the _Grain Growers' Guide_.  It lay right at the editor's\r\nfeet.  Chipman recognized a direct challenge and did not propose to\r\ndrop the matter with a denial in the columns of his paper--even with a\r\ndozen denials.  His old reportorial instinct was aroused.  Who was this\r\nmysterious \"Observer\"?  Why was he going to so much trouble as to\r\nlaunch a systematic campaign?  One thing was certain--he was NOT a\r\nfarmer!\r\n\r\nAll good newspaper reporters have two qualifications well developed;\r\nthey are able to recognize news values--having \"a nose for news,\" it is\r\ncalled--and they are able to run down a \"story\" with the instinct of a\r\ndetective.  G. P. Chipman had been a good reporter--a good police\r\nreporter particularly.  He had the detective's instinct and it did not\r\ntake him long to recognize that he was facing a situation which could\r\nbe uncovered only by detective work.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he reasoned, the letters were too cleverly\r\nwritten--so cleverly, in fact, that they could be the product of a\r\nprofessional writer only, most likely a Winnipeg man.  This narrowed\r\nthe search at once.  By process of elimination the list of possible\r\n\"Observers\" was soon reduced to a few names.  It was an easy matter to\r\nverify the suspicion that the \"letters\" were paid for at advertising\r\nrates and the question uppermost became: \"Who are the greatest\r\nbeneficiaries of these attacks?\"\r\n\r\n\"The elevator interests, of course!\" was Chipman's answer to his own\r\nquestion.  He began to make progress in his investigations and before\r\nlong he became very much interested in an office which happened to be\r\nlocated in the Merchant's Bank Building, Winnipeg.  Here a certain\r\nbright newspaper man with some farming experience had taken to business\r\nas a \"Financial Agent\"--telephone, stenographer and all the rest of the\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nSo sure was Chipman that he was on the right track in following this\r\nclue that finally he shut the door of his private office and wrote up\r\nthe whole story of the \"deal\" which he expected to have been made\r\nbetween certain elevator men and this clever editorial writer who knew\r\nso much about money that he had opened up a Financial Agency.  With the\r\nwhole \"exposure\" ready for publication and the photograph of the\r\n\"suspect\" handy in a drawer of the desk, Chipman asked the \"Financial\r\nAgent\" to call at the _Guide_ office.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you might like to look over that copy before we use it,\"\r\nexplained the editor casually when his visitor's pipe was going well.\r\nHe handed the write-up across his desk.  \"I want to be fair and there\r\nmight be something----\"\r\n\r\nThere decidedly was!--a number of things, in fact!  Not the least of\r\nthem was the utter surprise of the pseudo Financial Agent.  He did not\r\nattempt to deny the truth of the statements made for publication.\r\n\r\nAccording to the story which he told the editor of the _Guide_, it had\r\nbeen the original intention to have these \"letters to the press\" signed\r\nby leading elevator men themselves; but when it was decided to hire an\r\nexpert press agent to mould public opinion in such a way as to offset\r\nthe \"onesidedness\" of the farmers' movement, none of the elevator men\r\ncared to assume the publicity.  The name, \"Observer,\" would do just as\r\nwell.  A committee was organized to direct and supervise the work of\r\nthe press agent and the chairman of this committee conducted the\r\nnegotiations with the newspaper man who was to undertake the\r\npreparation of the \"letters\" and other material.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of his contract the press agent was to be paid in equal\r\nmonthly instalments at the rate of $4,000 per year, with a contract for\r\ntwo years.  For this he was to write letters which would turn public\r\nopinion against this Grain Growers' Grain Company, which was getting so\r\nmuch of the farmers' grain, and minimize the growth of sentiment in\r\nfavor of government ownership of internal and terminal elevators.\r\nThese communications he was to have published in the various papers of\r\nWinnipeg and the West.  Such was the story.\r\n\r\nThe better to conceal the wires beneath this publicity campaign and the\r\nidentity of the writer, Mr. \"Observer\" opened his office as a Financial\r\nAgency and became a subscriber to the _Grain Growers' Guide_--one\r\npaper, of course, which could not be approached for the purpose in\r\nview.  It was necessary, nevertheless, to clip and file the _Guide_\r\nvery carefully for reference; hence the subscription.\r\n\r\nThe space used by the \"correspondence\" was paid for at regular\r\nadvertising rates.  The advertising bill each week amounted to about\r\n$150.  But one factor in the success of the plan had been\r\noverlooked--the influence of the _Guide_.  No sooner had the official\r\npaper of the Grain Growers pointed out the situation to its readers and\r\nsuggested that papers which accepted material antagonistic to the\r\nfarmers' cause were no friends of the farmers--no sooner was this\r\npointed out than letters began to arrive in batches at the offices of\r\nall the papers which were publishing the \"Observer\" attacks.  Most of\r\nthese letters cancelled subscriptions and so fast did they begin to\r\ncome that one after another the papers refused to publish any more\r\n\"Observations,\" paid for or not.\r\n\r\nFor unknown reasons it was decided to call off the attempt to create\r\npublic opinion against government ownership of elevators and with the\r\nletters aimed at the farmers' trading activities being refused\r\npublication, the employers of \"Observer\" had no further work for him to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nAs they were still paying his interesting salary each month, they\r\noffered him $1,500 to tear up his contract, he said.  But with more\r\nthan a year and a half still to run--over $6,000 coming to him--Mr.\r\n\"Observer\" had a certain affection for that contract.  Fifteen hundred\r\ndollars?  Pooh, pooh!  He would settle for--well, say So-Much.\r\n\r\n\"You're talking through your hat!\" scoffed his employers in effect.\r\n\r\n\"It's a six-thousand-dollar hat!\" smiled \"Observer\" pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we won't pay any such lump sum as you say,\" virtually declared\r\nhis employers, not so pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"Just as you wish, gentlemen.  I'll wait, then, and draw my\r\nsalary--$333.33 1/3 every month, according to contract.  I know you\r\ndon't want me to sue for it; because we'd have to air the whole thing\r\nin the courts and there would be a lot of publicity.  So we'll just let\r\nher toddle along and no hard feelings.\"\r\n\r\nHe got his money.\r\n\r\nThe alleged attempt of these elevator men, whether with or without the\r\nsanction of their associates, to make public opinion by means of the\r\n\"Observer\" letters began in the fall of 1909.  It lasted but a few\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNAL ELEVATOR CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n  What constitutes a state? . . .\r\n  Men who their duties know,\r\n  But know their rights, and knowing, dare maintain.\r\n            --_Sir William Jones._\r\n              _Ode after Alcaeus._\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, about this Government Ownership of Elevators.  The Grain Growers\r\nhad had it in mind right along.  The elevators were the contact points\r\nbetween the farmer and the marketing machinery; therefore if his\r\nfingers got pinched it was here that he bled.  Complaints of injustice\r\nin the matter of weights, dockage, grades and prices colored the\r\nconversation of farmers in many parts of the country and, rightly or\r\nwrongly, many farmers were profoundly dissatisfied with existing\r\nconditions at initial elevators.  These elevators provided the only\r\navenue by which grain could be disposed of quickly if transportation\r\nfacilities were not fully adequate.  It seemed to the farmers,\r\ntherefore, that the only way to avoid monopolistic abuses was for the\r\nprovincial governments to own and operate a system of internal storage\r\nelevators and for the Dominion authorities to own and operate the\r\nterminals.  The elevators, declared the farmers, should be a public\r\nutility and not in private hands.\r\n\r\nThis feeling first found definite expression in a request by the\r\nManitoba Grain Growers prior to the Manitoba elections in 1907.  The\r\nManitoba Government declined to act on the request of the Grain Growers\r\nalone, but called a conference of municipal reeves and others\r\ninterested.  This conference was held in June and urgently requested\r\nthe Manitoba Government to acquire and operate a complete system of\r\nstorage elevators throughout the province, as asked for by the Grain\r\nGrowers.  Nothing was done at the first session of the renewed\r\ngovernment, however.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Grain Growers were circularizing the three Prairie\r\nProvinces on the need for a government system of elevators and at the\r\nannual conventions of the organized farmers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan\r\nand Alberta in 1908 strong endorsement of the idea was made.  An\r\n\"Inter-Provincial Council of Grain Growers' and Farmers' Associations\"\r\n[1] had been created, and this body urged the several executives to\r\nwait upon their respective governments and try to obtain definite\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Premier Roblin, of Manitoba, a conference of the\r\nthree premiers was arranged through the Secretary of the\r\nInter-Provincial Council.  It was the hope of the farmers that this\r\nmight lead to uniform legislation, introducing government ownership of\r\nthe elevators, and that the three provincial governments would join in\r\nan appeal to the Dominion Government for co-operation.  In each\r\nprovince the whole subject had been dealt with exhaustively in the text\r\nprepared by the Grain Growers--the conditions making a government\r\nsystem of elevators necessary, how it could be created and the\r\npracticability of its operation, the question of financing and the\r\nbeneficial results that would follow.  It was the idea of the farmers\r\nthat the provinces would purchase existing storage houses at a fair\r\nvaluation, issuing government bonds to finance the undertaking and\r\nbuild new elevators where needed.\r\n\r\nThe provincial Premiers met at Regina on May 4th, 1908, talked over the\r\nmatter, then sent for George Langley, M.P.P., one of the directors of\r\nthe Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association who occupied a seat in the\r\nSaskatchewan Legislature.  They appointed Mr. Langley as a sort of\r\nambassador in their negotiations with the Grain Growers'\r\nrepresentatives, sending him to the Inter-Provincial Council to present\r\nverbally a couple of alternative propositions--that the Railways should\r\nbe asked to build loading elevators with storage bins or that the\r\nmanagement of the elevators should be taken away from the present\r\nowners and profits limited while the farmers' organizations became\r\nresponsible for grades, weights, etc.\r\n\r\nBack came the Grain Growers with a document which repeated their former\r\ndemands and amplified their argument.  They claimed that they were\r\nentitled to what they were asking if only because the farmers formed\r\nthe major part of the population and their demands could be granted\r\nwithout placing any tax upon the remainder of the people.  They\r\nrequested a conference with the three Premiers to go into the matter in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nNot until November 4th, 1908, did this conference take place in Regina.\r\nWhen they did get together the Premiers were not posted well enough on\r\ndetails to promise anything more definite than that they would consult\r\ntheir colleagues and make reply in due course.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of January, 1909, before the Inter-Provincial Council\r\nhad an official reply.  The Premiers pointed to grave and complicated\r\nquestions which stood in the way of granting what the farmers were\r\nasking.  Constitutional difficulties, financial difficulties,\r\nlegislative difficulties--all were set forth in a lengthy and well\r\nwritten memorandum.  The British North America Act would have to be\r\namended to grant the provinces authority to create an absolute monopoly\r\nwithout which success would not be assured.  In short, there was such a\r\ntangle of overlapping jurisdictions, public interest in trade and\r\ncommerce, federal rights, railway rights and so on that the Premiers\r\ncould not see their way clear at all in spite of their great desire to\r\nhelp the farmers at all times.\r\n\r\nThe Grain Growers passed the document to their legal adviser and R. A.\r\nBonnar, K.C., gave them his opinion in writing.  That opinion was very\r\ncomplete, very authoritative, and poked so many holes in the\r\n\"constitutional difficulties\" that the farmers could see their way much\r\nmore clearly than the Premiers, to whom they made dignified rejoinder.\r\nThey handed on the holes while they were at it in the hope that the\r\nheads of the three Provincial Governments could take a peek through the\r\n\"difficulties\" for themselves and see just how clear the way really was\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Premiers, however, took the step which logically\r\nfollowed their reply to the farmers.  Resolutions were introduced in\r\nthe Alberta and Manitoba Legislatures that His Excellency the\r\nGovernor-in-Council be memorialized in regard to the elevator question\r\nand asked to provide government ownership and operation or to have the\r\nnecessary powers to deal with the matter conferred upon the provinces.\r\n\r\nThus things rode until December 14th, 1909, when the Committee on\r\nAgriculture in the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly recommended the\r\nappointment of a commission to make searching enquiry into the subject\r\nof government control and operation of the internal elevators as asked\r\nfor by the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, at the annual convention of the Manitoba Grain Growers,\r\nHon. George Coldwell announced for the Manitoba Government that they\r\nhad accepted the principle of establishing a line of internal elevators\r\nas a public utility, owned by the public and operated for the public.\r\nSo unexpectedly did this good news come that the farmers were amazed at\r\ntheir own success.  They had fought for it long and earnestly and\r\nvictory meant a very great deal; but it had seemed still beyond reach.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Manitoba it only remained now to get together and thresh\r\nout the details.  A strong committee was appointed to conduct\r\nnegotiations with the Government and there was prepared a memorandum of\r\nthe plan which the farmers recommended the Government to follow.  This\r\nwas presented on January 5th, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe Government and the Grain Growers then each got ready a bill for\r\nconsideration by the Legislature.  Many conferences took place.  The\r\nGovernment refused the farmers' bill and the farmers did not approve of\r\nthe Government's proposals.  While leaving full financial control in\r\nthe hands of the Government, the Grain Growers demanded that the\r\noperation of the elevators be undertaken by an absolutely independent\r\ncommission without any political affiliations whatsoever; it was\r\nprovided also that no officer of the Grain Growers could act on this\r\ncommission.  The Government did not deem it wise to let control of the\r\nmanaging commission out of its hands.  So negotiations were broken off.\r\n\r\nThe Manitoba Government now prepared a new bill, but did not remove the\r\nfeatures to which the farmers were objecting.  This bill was passed and\r\nthe Government voted $50,000 for initial expenses and $2,000,000 for\r\nacquiring elevators.  Beyond a weak protest from the North-West Grain\r\nDealers' Association the elevator owners had not shown much excitement\r\nover the situation.  While the Manitoba Grain Growers were not\r\nsatisfied that the Government plan would work out successfully and\r\ntherefore refused to assume responsibility in connection with it, they\r\nwere ready nevertheless to lend their best co-operation to the Manitoba\r\nElevator Commission when it got into action.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Saskatchewan an altogether different plan was\r\nevolved in due course.  The investigating commission, appointed\r\nFebruary 28th, 1910, consisted of three well qualified men--George\r\nLangley, M.P.P.; F. W. Green, Secretary of the Saskatchewan Grain\r\nGrowers' Association; Professor Robert Magill, of Dalhousie University,\r\nNova Scotia, the latter acting as chairman.  The commission held\r\nsittings at many points in Saskatchewan, taking evidence from a large\r\nnumber of farmers, went to Winnipeg to meet representatives of elevator\r\ncompanies, the Exchange and Government officials, and also visited\r\nseveral American cities.  Their final report, consisting of 188\r\ntypewritten pages, was handed to the Saskatchewan Government on October\r\n31st, 1910.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the comprehensive scheme outlined by the Saskatchewan\r\nGrain Growers many different suggestions were considered by the\r\ncommission, such as government ownership and operation, state aided\r\nFarmers' Elevators, municipal elevators and various modifications of\r\nthese plans.  All, however, were discarded by the commission in favor\r\nof an experiment in co-operative ownership and management by the\r\nfarmers themselves, assisted financially by the Provincial Government.\r\n\r\nThe scheme presented by the executive of the Saskatchewan Grain\r\nGrowers' Association appeared to be unworkable because it overstepped\r\nmere public ownership and operation of initial elevators to include\r\nmethods of sampling, grading before shipment, bank and government\r\nloans, features outside the power of a provincial legislature.  The\r\nschemes of municipal and district elevators, while appealing to local\r\nloyalty for patronage, did not secure the farmers' direct pecuniary\r\ninterest to make the elevators successful in the face of competition.\r\nAs to the Manitoba plan, the commission were unanimous in advising\r\nagainst it in view of the financial risk and the disadvantages of\r\npolitical influences which would tend to make themselves felt.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of a plan aiming at ownership of initial elevators\r\nby the State and management by the Government of the day, the\r\ncommission recommended ownership and management by the growers of\r\ngrain.  Such a co-operative scheme would aim equally well at removing\r\ninitial storage from the ownership of companies interested in grain\r\ntrading--would recognize as promptly the feeling of injustice in the\r\nminds of many farmers--would seek just as fully to create marketing\r\nconditions which would give the farmer satisfaction and confidence.\r\nWhile both the Manitoba scheme and the proposed co-operative scheme\r\ninvolved financial aid by the State, the commission saw reason to\r\nbelieve that with control and management in the hands of the farmers\r\nthemselves many of the risks and limitations of other plans would be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that in reporting upon general conditions in the\r\ngrain trade of Canada in 1910 the Saskatchewan Elevator Commission\r\npointed out the great change which had taken place since 1900.  One\r\nfactor in this had been the construction of new transcontinental lines\r\nand thousands of miles of branch railway lines together with a great\r\nincrease in car supply and a more efficient and cheaper system of\r\ntransportation.  Again, the use of loading-platforms had introduced\r\nreal competition with the elevators, almost fifteen million bushels of\r\nthe 1908-09 crop in Western Canada having been shipped direct by the\r\nfarmers.  The development of co-operation among the farmers through the\r\nGrain Growers' Associations had led to much advantageous legislation,\r\nwhile Farmers' Elevators and Public Weigh Scales had had a salutary\r\neffect at many shipping points.  The organization of the Grain Growers'\r\nGrain Company as a farmers' own selling agency likewise had exerted a\r\nwide influence for good all over the West, enabling the farmers to\r\nobtain first-hand information about existing methods of dealing in\r\ngrain.  Finally, the protection afforded by the Manitoba Grain Act was\r\nnot to be questioned; for while it was impossible to draft any Act\r\nwhich would prevent all the abuses alleged, it had been the means of\r\nproviding many weapons of defence for the farmer and unfamiliarity with\r\nthese provisions by individual farmers was scarcely to be blamed upon\r\nthe Act itself.\r\n\r\nThe improvement in conditions, compared with earlier years, was\r\nrecognized by most of the farmers appearing before the commission and\r\nmany of them had no personal complaint to make in regard to weights,\r\ngrades or prices.  They were advocates of provincial ownership not so\r\nmuch on their own behalf as upon behalf of settlers in newer districts.\r\nThe commission, therefore, while not saying that there were no cases of\r\nsharp practice or no grounds for dissatisfaction, were impressed by the\r\nfact that however powerless farmers had been in earlier days they were\r\nnow in a very different position.  The strong feeling which many\r\nfarmers had against the line elevator companies was based upon\r\nexperiences of rank injustice and bitter recollections of the past; for\r\nthis the elevator people could blame nobody but themselves.  But the\r\nfactors enumerated undoubtedly had improved the situation from the\r\nfarmers' standpoint and it only remained to strengthen these factors to\r\ngive the farmer complete control in the matter of initial storage.\r\n\r\nThe commission were unanimous in recommending co-operative organization\r\nof the farmers as the probable solution of the situation in\r\nSaskatchewan.  They suggested the enactment of special legislation to\r\nprovide for the financing of the undertaking by the farmers themselves,\r\nassisted by a government loan.  That is, the farmers surrounding a\r\npoint where an elevator was needed would subscribe the total amount of\r\ncapital necessary to build it, paying fifteen per cent. in cash, the\r\ncrop acreage of the shareholders at that point to total not less than\r\n2,000 acres for each 10,000 bushels capacity of the proposed elevator;\r\nthese conditions fulfilled, the government would advance the remaining\r\neighty-five per cent. of the subscribed capital in the form of a loan,\r\nrepayable in twenty equal annual instalments of principal and interest,\r\nfirst mortgage security.  The commission also suggested that the\r\nresponsibility of preliminary organization be thrown upon the farmers\r\nthemselves by appointing the executive of the Saskatchewan Grain\r\nGrowers' Association as provisional directors of the new grain handling\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nWhen the matter came before the Saskatchewan Legislature the annual\r\nconvention of the Saskatchewan Association was being held at Regina and\r\nthe farmers declared themselves ready to assume responsibility and go\r\nahead.  A bill was introduced by the Government, embodying the\r\nrecommendations of the Commission, and the Act incorporating The\r\nSaskatchewan Co-Operative Elevator Company, Limited, was assented to on\r\nMarch 14th, 1911.\r\n\r\nBecause of the unusual financial arrangements with the Provincial\r\nGovernment the capital stock was not set at a fixed amount but left\r\nsubject to change from time to time by the Government.  In order to\r\nprotect the credit of the Province the Government thus was able to\r\ncontrol the amount of stock the company could issue and thereby the\r\namount of money the Government might be called upon to advance for the\r\nconstruction or purchase of elevators.  Shares were placed at $50 each,\r\navailable for farmers only, and a limit was set upon individual\r\nholdings.\r\n\r\nIt was provided that each local unit would have a local board of\r\nmanagement and appoint delegates to an annual meeting where a Central\r\nBoard of Management would be elected.  The company was empowered not\r\nonly to own and operate elevators and buy and sell grain, but to own\r\nand operate lumber yards, deal in coal and other commodities and \"do\r\nall things incidental to the production, storing and marketing of\r\ngrain.\"\r\n\r\nBy June 16th, 1911, the Provisional Directors[1] were able to call the\r\nfirst annual meeting of the new organization, having fulfilled the\r\nrequirement of the Act that twenty-five \"locals\" be first organized,\r\nand by July 6th--the date of the general meeting at Moose Jaw--an\r\nadditional twenty-one \"locals\" were ready.  Thus they were able to\r\nstart with forty-six units, representing $405,050 capitalization with\r\n8,101 shares held by 2,580 shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe newly-elected directors[2] proceeded forthwith to let contracts for\r\nforty new elevators, standard type of thirty and forty thousand bushels\r\ncapacity with cleaning machinery and special bins.  Six existing\r\nelevators were purchased.\r\n\r\nThe Grain Growers' Grain Company agreed to act as selling agents for\r\nthis new baby sister and wide-spread interest became manifest as the\r\nGrain Growers took another step into commercial circles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix--Par. 8.\r\n\r\n[2] See Appendix--Par. 12.\r\n\r\n[3] See Appendix--Par. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE TERMINALS\r\n\r\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp\r\nof experience.  I know no way of judging the future but by the\r\npast.--_Patrick Henry_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of co-operative elevators for the storing of\r\ngrain at interior points the farmers of Western Canada launched out\r\nupon the greatest experiment in co-operation this continent has seen.\r\nThe success of these elevators, owned and controlled by the farmers\r\nthemselves, in all probability would evolve the final phase of internal\r\nstorage in connection with the Canadian grain fields.\r\n\r\nCo-incident with their agitation for government ownership of elevators\r\nat country points, the farmers were urging upon the federal authorities\r\nthe desirability of government control and operation of terminal\r\nstorage facilities.  It was not enough that the Provincial Governments\r\nof the Prairie Provinces should protect the farmers within their\r\nboundaries; for the terminal storage of grain was a part of the system\r\nand the farmers contended that corporation control of the terminals by\r\ngrain dealers was leading to abuses and manipulations of the grain that\r\nwere not in the best interests of the country.\r\n\r\nGrateful as they were, therefore, for the efforts to improve early\r\nconditions by legislation, it was the opinion of the Grain Growers that\r\nthese contraventions of the Grain Act would be prevented only by\r\nacquisition of the terminals by the Dominion Government.  Mere\r\nlegislation and supervision by the Government would not provide an\r\neffective remedy.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the lakes the grain passed out of the control of the\r\ntransportation companies into the hands of the grain dealers; it was\r\nthe only point in transit where it became subject to manipulation.\r\nWith the exception of those owned by the C. P. R., the terminal\r\nelevators were operated by dealers, largely controlled by United States\r\nconcerns and managed by experts from across the line.  It was\r\nfrequently charged that terminal operators forgot that they ought to be\r\nwarehousemen solely and sought profits outside those of legitimate\r\nelevation and storage charges, although these authorized charges paid\r\nample return on capital investment.  The farmers wanted this temptation\r\nof handling and mixing grain at the terminals removed so that terminal\r\noperators could not tamper with the grain while it was in their\r\ncustody.  The claims of the Grain Growers that mixing was going on at\r\nFort William and Port Arthur were based upon the report of the Royal\r\nGrain Commission which had investigated the grain trade in 1906-7.\r\n\r\nThe first definite step taken to lay these matters before the Dominion\r\nGovernment was in the winter of 1908 after the formation of the\r\nInter-Provincial Council of Grain Growers' and Farmers' Associations.\r\nAt a meeting of these representatives of all the organized farmers it\r\nwas decided to send delegates to Ottawa.  When these gentlemen reached\r\ntheir destination in May, 1909, they found themselves face to face with\r\na large and active group of grain men, railway officials and bankers\r\nwho had gathered to take a hand in the interview with Sir Richard\r\nCartwright, then Minister of Trade and Commerce.  Beyond some\r\nconcessions regarding special binning of grain, nothing came of this\r\ntrip apparently, although the Western farmers were supported strongly\r\nby the Dominion Millers' Association.\r\n\r\nA second memorandum was presented early in 1910 and the Grain Growers\r\nwere granted a very respectful hearing by the Government; for, while\r\nthe organized farmers represented but part of the farming constituency\r\nin the West, they had the sympathy of the entire farming community\r\nbehind them in these requests.  They went home, however, feeling the\r\nneed of concentrating their energies on organization if they were to\r\nget actual action from politicians.\r\n\r\nThey had not much more than got home safely before something happened\r\nwhich proved their assertions that all was not as it should be down on\r\nthe lake-front.  Mr. C. C. Castle, Warehouse Commissioner, one day held\r\nin his hand some official reports from the Inspection Department\r\nconcerning certain elevator concerns and compared the figures with the\r\nreturns made to the authorities by these concerns themselves.  He shook\r\nhis head at the discrepancies and started an investigation.  There were\r\nthree companies involved and after full evidence was taken legally\r\nthese three companies were prosecuted for returning untrue statements\r\nand in the Police Court at Winnipeg they were fined a total of $5,550\r\nby the Magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was the drafting of a Grain Bill which aimed to improve\r\ncertain matters.  It was considered by the Senate and passed.  It\r\nreached the House of Commons and Hon. Frank Oliver took it by the\r\nhalter and led it about.  Before anything could happen to it, however,\r\nand the judges get a chance to study its good and bad points, July\r\n(1911) came along and Parliament dissolved like a lump of sugar dropped\r\ninto a cup of tea and in the hub-bubbles of a general election\r\neverything was _in statu quo_, as they say.  And when the race was over\r\nand the Party Nags back in their stalls, lo! new tenants were taking\r\ntheir turn at sliding around on the polished Treasury Benches and\r\nhaving a sun bath!\r\n\r\nThe new Minister of Trade and Commerce was Hon. George E. Foster.  He\r\nlooked over the Grain Bill, passed his hand along its withers and\r\npatted it on the rump.  Then he sat down and made a copy of it,\r\nidealizing it by injecting a few \"betterments,\" then trotted it out for\r\ninspection with tail and mane plaited and bells on its patent-leather\r\nsurcingle.  He did not claim to be its real father--only its\r\nfoster-father.  He introduced it to the House with a very lucid review\r\nof the whole agitation for improvement in the Grain and Inspection Acts\r\nsince \"Johnny\" Millar, of Indian Head, Saskatchewan, handed in the\r\nRoyal Grain Commission report in 1907.\r\n\r\nThe new Government proposed to grant government control of terminal\r\nelevators only on a limited and experimental scale.  They wanted to\r\ntest out the principle by lease or construction of two or three\r\nterminals at the head of the lakes before undertaking the financial\r\nresponsibility of handling the entire terminal system.  Heretofore\r\nthere had been government supervision merely; but now for an experiment\r\nthere would be government operation as well while the management of the\r\nremaining terminals would have to be satisfactory to the Government.\r\n\r\n\"The demand of the West is that the grain should not be manipulated at\r\nthe terminals,\" declared Mr. Foster.  \"It does not matter a pin as to\r\nhow that is brought about so that the thing itself is accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nThe new bill provided for sample markets and the farmers did not like\r\nthis unless the Government acquired the terminals as had been\r\nrequested.  Owing to the grain blockade, due to car shortage, feeling\r\nwas running high in the West and the farmers eyed the new legislation\r\nclosely.  They came upon a clause which startled them and in the row\r\nthat followed it looked at one time as if the new Bill would be led to\r\nthe boneyard and killed.\r\n\r\nOne of the proposals of the Government was the formation of a Board of\r\nGrain Commissioners with wide discretionary powers.  They would be made\r\nresponsible for the proper conduct of the entire grain trade and deal\r\nwith all matters pertaining thereto.  They were to have the absolute\r\nsay-so in regard to car distribution and there was one clause that\r\nthreatened this protection for which the Western farmers had fought so\r\nhard in earlier days.\r\n\r\nAt once consternation spread among the Grain Growers, their\r\napprehensions based upon bitter experience.  They protested vehemently.\r\nLetters, petitions and resolutions slid all over the official\r\nGovernment desks and delegations followed to Ottawa.  Not the organized\r\ngrain growers alone, but the whole Western farming element was up in\r\narms.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the new Grain Bill passed the House of Commons and\r\nbrowsed over to the Senate.\r\n\r\nIt was the farmers' last chance to stop it.  R. McKenzie and J. S.\r\nWood, of the Manitoba Grain Growers; J. A. Maharg and F. W. Green, of\r\nthe Saskatchewan Grain Growers, and E. J. Fream, of the United Farmers\r\nof Alberta--these practical men figuratively took off their coats and\r\nwaded in when they got in conference with Senate members.  They\r\npreferred to see the whole bill killed unless the objectionable clause\r\nregarding car distribution were struck out; they saw the old-time\r\nelevator abuses again becoming possible and quite nullifying the many\r\ngood features which the new legislation possessed.\r\n\r\nThe final upshot was that somewhat unexpectedly Hon. Senator Lougheed,\r\nleader in the Upper House, withdrew the offending clause on behalf of\r\nthe Government, although the Government felt that the farmers were\r\nunduly excited.\r\n\r\nThe new Board of Grain Commissioners was appointed without delay and\r\nconsisted of three men who understood Western conditions--W. D.\r\nStaples, of Treherne, Manitoba; Frank E. Gibbs, of Fort William, and\r\nDr. Robert Magill, now Secretary of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.  Dr.\r\nMagill was made Chief Grain Commissioner, for he had rendered excellent\r\nservices in the past and commanded the respect of the entire West.\r\n\r\nThe Board was not long in reaching the conclusion that if grain dealing\r\ncompanies were to be eliminated from the business of owning and\r\noperating terminal elevators, outright purchase and breaking of leases\r\nwould be necessary.  The companies refused to lease to the Government\r\nvoluntarily on any terms which the Board could recommend.  Some would\r\nnot lease on any terms whatever, claiming that to lease their terminals\r\nwould dislocate their whole system of interior elevators, involving a\r\nloss of capital which had been invested legitimately.  Apart from this,\r\nthe Board had its hands so full with other important things that\r\nexpropriation and all that it involved would claim their whole time and\r\nenergy to the neglect of other urgent matters.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Grain Commissioners recommended that the Government\r\nmeet the immediate need of increased terminal facilities at the head of\r\nthe lakes by building a three-million-bushel elevator, thoroughly\r\nequipped for storing, cleaning, drying and handling grain and with\r\nprovision for future extensions to a capacity of thirty million\r\nbushels.  They also approved of the Grain Growers' Grain Company\r\nleasing one of the C. P. R. elevators.  In this way both the Board and\r\nthe Grain Growers would gain first-hand knowledge of terminal elevator\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWhile formulating a policy for terminal elevators the Grain\r\nCommissioners considered the need for terminal storage in the interior\r\nas well as at the lakefront.  The increase in the area of the grain\r\nfields, particularly in Alberta, was straining the transportation\r\nfacilities to the limit and the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific\r\npromised to open up still more acreage.  Railway rolling stock, railway\r\nyard accommodations at Winnipeg and Fort William and elevator storage\r\nwere not keeping pace with the annual volume of new grain.  The\r\nGovernment Inspection Department was up to its eyes in grain, working\r\nnight and day during the rush season, while lake and ocean tonnage\r\nlikewise were inadequate.  Even the eleven million bushels of extra\r\nstorage capacity being built at the lake at the time the Board was\r\nconsidering the situation would soon fill and overflow.  Congestion at\r\neastern transfer houses or terminal points was threatening, water\r\nfreight rates were up and the export market disturbed and there was no\r\nreserve of storage capacity in Western Canada to meet emergencies.  In\r\na wet season the drying plants at Fort William and Port Arthur were far\r\nfrom adequate.  Delayed inspection returns and terminal outturns, due\r\nto the recurring car shortage, prevented the farmers from financing and\r\nwidened the spread between street and track prices as the close of\r\nnavigation approached.\r\n\r\nReviewing all this, the Grain Commissioners came to the conclusion that\r\nit was time to consider seriously the erection of Government terminal\r\nfacilities nearer the grain fields.  Especially in Alberta was the need\r\ngreat for inspection and terminal storage to be nearer the producer.\r\nIt would relieve congestion, benefit the whole grain trade and provide\r\nfor the future possibility of alternate shipping routes via Hudson Bay\r\nor the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nIt was true that the Royal Grain Commission of 1906-7 had raised\r\nobjections to interior terminals and inspection, such as the extra\r\nexpense of handling, the extra loss to the grain in handling and\r\nre-handling, the possibility of the railways solving the car shortage\r\nproblem, the difficulty of getting shippers to send their grain to such\r\nelevators and so forth.  But the Board considered that, in view of\r\nother possible routes than the Eastern, these objections were not\r\nstrong enough to balance the benefits.  Accordingly they recommended\r\nthe Government to take action, the elevators to be regarded as public\r\nterminals in which mixing of grades would be forbidden.\r\n\r\nWhile the farmers in all three Prairie Provinces were busy with these\r\nvital matters, the Grain Growers' Grain Company meanwhile was wading\r\nalong through all the difficult seasons of car shortage, expanding its\r\nusefulness and trying its best to give the maximum of service the while\r\nit was reaching out into the export field in an experimental way.\r\n\r\nThen, in 1911, a situation arose unexpectedly that caused turmoil among\r\nthe officers of the pioneer company and led to considerable anxiety\r\namong the Grain Growers all over the West.  For, through an excess of\r\nzeal upon the part of an employee, the Grain Growers' Grain Company\r\nsuddenly found itself dragged into the maelstrom of \"The Pit.\"  It was\r\naccused of trying to corner the oat market and was forced to fight for\r\nvery life.\r\n\r\nSo that at last it looked indeed as if Chance had delivered the farmers\r\ninto the hands of those who preferred to see them eliminated altogether\r\nfrom the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE GRIP OF THE PIT\r\n\r\nNow, infidel, I have thee on the hip!\r\n            --_Merchant of Venice._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitors' gallery is an excellent vantage point from which to view\r\nthe trading floor of the Exchange.

She is somewhat reassured by noting a few seats\r\naway a man who wears the garb of a clergyman; presently he will take\r\nnotes for his forthcoming sermon on \"The Propinquity of Temptation and\r\nIts Relation to the Christian Life.\"  The two young women who whisper\r\ntogether in the corner have been reading stockmarket stories in the\r\nmagazines and they are wondering which of the traders, assembling on\r\nthe floor below, will have his coat and collar torn off and which will\r\nbreak down and give vent to those \"big, dry man-sobs\" when his fortune\r\nis wrecked!\r\n\r\nNot the least of the sights at the Grain Exchange is the Visitors'\r\nGallery!\r\n\r\nTwo tanned farmers are discussing quotations and general conditions in\r\na matter-of-fact way.  War demands, the unfavorable United States\r\nGovernment report and rumors of black rust are making for a bullish\r\ncondition.  Cables are up and the market promises to be wild this\r\nmorning.  The gong will go in five minutes.\r\n\r\n\"The Pit\" is out in the middle of the floor.  There is an octagonal\r\nplatform, raised a couple of feet from the floor level.  In the centre\r\nof this platform three wide steps descend to floor level again; so that\r\nthe traders standing on the different steps are able to see over one\r\nanother's heads and note each other's bids.  On the west side of the\r\nPit is an elevated, built-in desk like those seen in court-rooms,\r\nsomewhat resembling an old-fashioned pulpit; here three men sit\r\nthroughout the session.  One keeps his fingers on the switch-box which\r\noperates the big clock on the north wall where the fluctuations of the\r\ntrading are flashed on a frosted dial in red-light figures.  At his\r\nleft sits a second man whose duty it is to record the bidding on an\r\nofficial form for the purpose.  At the right is a telegraph operator\r\nwho sends the record of the trading as it occurs to other big\r\nExchanges--Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, etc.\r\n\r\nThe telegraphic report registers in several instruments attached to the\r\nbig blackboard that occupies the entire north wall.  Operators with\r\nchalk and chalk-brush in hand move about the platform at the base of\r\nthis blackboard, catching the quotations from the clicking instruments\r\nand altering the figures on the board to keep pace with the changing\r\ninformation.  A glance at this great blackboard will furnish the latest\r\nquotations on wheat, oats, barley, flax, corn, etc., the world over.\r\n\r\nRanged along the entire east wall are the clacking instruments of the\r\nvarious telegraph companies for the use of the brokers and firms\r\ntrading on the Winnipeg Exchange.  Telephone booths at the north, seats\r\nfor friends of members on the west side, weather maps, etc., beneath\r\nthe gallery--these complete the equipment of the big chamber.\r\n\r\nThe group about the Pit, waiting for the market to open, grows rapidly\r\nas 9.30 approaches.  Members of the Exchange saunter in from the\r\nsmoking-room, swap good-natured banter or confer earnestly with their\r\nrepresentatives on the floor.  In response to the megaphoned bellow of\r\na call boy, individuals hurry to the telephone booths.  Messengers\r\nshove about, looking for certain brokers.  The market is very unsteady;\r\nit may go up or down.  The men are clustering about the Pit now; most\r\nof them are in their shirt-sleeves and they are on tip-toe like\r\nsprinters who wait for the starter's pistol.  Some of them have\r\ninstructions to dump wheat on the market; some have been told to buy.\r\nHundreds of thousands of bushels will change hands in the first few\r\nminutes.  The market may go up or it may go--\r\n\r\nBang goes the gong!  They're off!  Above the red abbreviation, OCT., at\r\nthe bottom of the big clock the blood-red figure 5 indicates the\r\nopening of the market at $1.45 even.  With a mad swirl the trading\r\nbegins in a roar of voices.  A small forest of arms waves wildly above\r\njostling bodies.  Traders dive for each other, clutch each other and\r\nwatch the clock.  The red figure 5 has gone out and 7/8 has in turn\r\nvanished in favor of 5/8--1/2--3/8--4--(?)  Instead of going up, she's\r\nfalling fast.  Before the market closes the price may rebound to $1.55.\r\nSomebody will make a \"clean-up\" to-day and many speculators will\r\ndisappear; for margins are being wiped out every minute.\r\n\r\nTo the Gallery it is a pandemonium of noise, unintelligible in the\r\nvolume of it that beats against the void of the high chamber.  Only one\r\nshrill voice flings up out of the roar:\r\n\r\n\"Sell fifty Oc, sev'-eights!\"  He offers 50,000 bushels of wheat for\r\nOctober delivery at $1.43 7/8 per bushel.  It's that fellow down there\r\nwith the blazing red tie half way up his collar.  He hits out with both\r\nhands at the air as he yells.  A surge of buyers overwhelms him.  They\r\nscribble notes upon their sales cards and go at it again.\r\n\r\nDown there in the mêlée those men are thinking fast.  With every flash\r\nof the clock the situation changes for many of them.  Some pause,\r\nwatching, listening; others who have been quiet till now suddenly break\r\nin with a bellow, seemingly on the point of punching the noses of the\r\nmen with whom they are doing business.  Lightning calculation;\r\ninstantaneous decisions!  \"Use your discretion\" many of them have been\r\ncautioned by their firms and they are using it.  A moment's hesitation\r\nmay cost a thousand dollars.  Trading in the Pit is no child's play;\r\nrather is it a severe strain even upon those who know every trick,\r\nevery firm and the character of its dealings, every trader and his\r\nindividuality, his particular methods--who know every sign and its\r\nmeaning, who can read the coming shout by the first movement of the\r\nlips.  And always, in and out, are darting the telegraph messenger boys\r\nwith yellow slips that cause upheavals.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't they take their time and do their trading more quietly and\r\nsystematically?\" ventures Friend Wife up in the gallery.\r\n\r\n\"And lose a cent a bushel while they're turning around, eh?\" laughs\r\nFriend Husband.  \"On a hundred thousand bushels that'd only be a\r\nthousand dollars.  Of course that's mere car-fare!\"\r\n\r\nThe dear old lady from the quiet eddies of Shelterville is shaking her\r\nhead in disapprobation and communing with herself upon the iniquities\r\nof gambling.\r\n\r\n\"My, oh my!  What won't men do for money!  Jt-jt!  Just look at 'em!\r\nFightin' like that for money they ain't earnt!  An' that nice lookin'\r\nyoung feller with the intelligent gold specs!--Dear me, it's enough to\r\nmake a body sad!\"\r\n\r\nShe could not know that but comparatively few of the traders below were\r\nrepresentatives of brokerage firms which were trading on margins for\r\nspeculating clients--that most of the traders were negotiating\r\nlegitimate deals in futures for firms who actually had the grain for\r\nsale, for exporters who would take delivery of the actual wheat for\r\nshipment, for milling companies who would grind it into actual flour.\r\n\r\nBecause trading for delivery in future months affords opportunity for\r\nspeculation, it is not to be condemned necessarily.  It is the balance\r\nwheel which steadies the entire grain business.  Even the speculating\r\nelement is not without its uses at times and the layman who ventures to\r\ncondemn This or That out of hand will do well to make sure he\r\nunderstands what he is talking about; for the business of the grain\r\ndealer is so subject to varying conditions and so involved in its\r\nmethods that it is one of the most difficult to be found in the\r\ncommercial world.\r\n\r\nTrading in futures finds birth in the very natural disinclination of\r\nMr. Baker to buy his flour by the warehouseful.  He does not want to\r\nprovide storage for a year's supply, even if he could stand such a\r\nlarge bite out of his capital without losing his balance.  So while the\r\nbakery man is anxious to order his flour in large quantities for future\r\nuse, he is equally anxious to have it delivered only as he needs it,\r\npaying for it only as it reaches him--say, every three months.\r\n\r\nBefore contracting for the delivery of the flour on this basis Mr.\r\nMiller must look to his wheat supply on a similar basis of So-Much\r\nevery So-Often and he, too, has an eye on storage and, like his friend\r\nthe baker, he \"needs the dough,\" as they say on the street, and he does\r\nnot want to part with any more hard-working money than he can help.\r\nAccordingly he looks around for somebody who has wheat for sale and\r\nwill sell it right now at a fixed price but defer delivery and payment\r\nto a future date.  With the price of his wheat thus nailed down, Mr.\r\nMiller can set the future price on his flour to his customers, taking\r\ndelivery and paying for the wheat as he requires it for filling his\r\nflour orders.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime where is the wheat?  Out near the fields where it was\r\ngrown, in country elevators perhaps, ready for transportation to market\r\nas the law of supply and demand dictates instead of the whole crop\r\nbeing dumped at once and smothering prices below the cost of\r\nproduction.  Or perhaps it is in store at the terminal where Mr.\r\nExporter can handle it.  It will be seen that the mutual arrangement to\r\nbuy and sell for future delivery simplifies matters for everybody in\r\nthe grain trade.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the legitimate trader in futures protects himself\r\nfrom price fluctuation is easily understood.  While a deal in cash\r\nwheat would refer to a definite shipment as shown by warehouse\r\nreceipts, a deal for future delivery is merely an obligation involving\r\na given quantity of grain at a given time at a given price.  Being\r\nmerely a contract and not an actual shipment, the seller does not\r\nrequire to produce the grain immediately nor is the buyer required to\r\nhand over the purchase price when the trade is made.  Thus it is\r\npossible to buy a thousand bushels to-day for October payment and sell\r\na thousand bushels to-morrow for October delivery, cancelling the\r\nobligation.  The trade can be balanced at any time before October 1st.\r\nAgain, a thousand bushels of October wheat may be bought (or sold)\r\nto-day and the future switched to May 1st by the sale (or purchase) of\r\na thousand bushels for May delivery.\r\n\r\nTake the man with the blazing red tie half way up his collar, the man\r\nwho this morning offered to sell fifty thousand bushels for October\r\ndelivery at $1.43 7/8.  Suppose that he represents a company with a\r\nline of elevators at country points.  To his office at Winnipeg has\r\ncome word from country representatives that fifty thousand bushels have\r\nbeen purchased for the company.  At once he enters the Pit and sells\r\nfifty thousand bushels for delivery at a future date, thereby \"hedging\"\r\nthe cash purchase out in the country.  Once this future of fifty\r\nthousand is sold the company no longer is interested in market prices\r\nso far as this grain is concerned.  If the market goes up, their cash\r\ngrain is that much more valuable, offsetting the loss of an equal\r\namount on the future delivery; if the price goes down, what is lost on\r\nthe cash wheat will be gained on the future.  So that the difference\r\nbetween the price paid for the grain at the country elevators and the\r\nprice at which they sold \"the hedge\" is the only thing which need\r\nconcern the grain company and it is here they must look for expenses\r\nand profits.  This method of hedging enables a grain company to make\r\npurchases in the country on much smaller margins than was possible in\r\nthe early days when the marketing machinery was less completely\r\norganized.  It eliminates to the greatest extent the necessity of\r\nspeculating to cover risks.\r\n\r\nThe speculator's opportunity comes in connection with the fluctuations\r\nof the market in deliveries.  He merely bets that prices will go up or\r\ndown, as the case may be.  He is not dealing in actual wheat but in\r\nmargins.  He buys to-day through his broker, who has a seat on the\r\nExchange, and deposits enough money to cover a fluctuation of say ten\r\ncents per bushel.  If October wheat to-day is quoted at $1.45 his\r\ndeposit will keep his purchase in good standing until the price has\r\ndropped to $1.35.  He must put up a further deposit then or lose the\r\namount he has risked already, the broker selling out his holding.  If\r\nthe speculator is on the right side of the market--if he has guessed\r\nthat it will go up and it does go up--he can sell and pocket a profit\r\nof so-many-cents per bushel, according to the number of points the\r\nprice has risen.  If he has bet that the market will go down the\r\nsituation merely is reversed.\r\n\r\nThe machinery for handling the huge volume of business transactions in\r\na grain exchange must be complete and smooth running to the last\r\ndetail, so designed that every contingency which may arise will be\r\nunder control.  For simplicity and efficiency in this connection the\r\nWinnipeg Grain Exchange occupies a unique position among the great\r\nexchanges of the American continent; in fact, it is a matter for wonder\r\nthat its methods have not been copied elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Winnipeg Grain and Produce Exchange Clearing Association is a\r\nseparate organization within the Exchange and to it belong all the\r\nExchange members who deal largely in futures.  Each day the market\r\ncloses at 1.15 p.m.  By two o'clock every firm trading on the floor\r\nmust hand in a report sheet, showing every deal made that day by the\r\nfirm--the quantity of wheat bought or sold, the firm with whom the\r\ntrade was made, the price, etc.  If on totalling the day's transactions\r\nit is found that they entail a loss, the firm must hand over a cheque\r\nto the Clearing House to cover the loss; if a gain in price is totalled\r\nthe Clearing House will issue a cheque for it to the firm so gaining.\r\nThus, if Jones & Brown have bought wheat at $1.39 and the market closes\r\nat $1.35 they lose four cents per bushel on their purchase and must\r\nsettle the difference with the Clearing House.  All differences between\r\nbuyers and sellers must be settled each day and if the volume of trades\r\nhas been heavy, the Clearing House staff work on their books--all\r\nnight, if necessary--until everything has been cleared for next day's\r\nbusiness.  The firm which loses to-day may gain by to-morrow's trades,\r\nmaintaining good average business health.  Any private trading which\r\nmay take place after official trading hours is known as \"curb\" trading.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the Clearing House are very strict.  Any firm which fails\r\nto report by two o'clock is fined.  The Clearing House assumes\r\nresponsibility for all purchases and sales and, being actually liable,\r\nkeeps close tab on every firm.  Each firm has a certain credit on the\r\nbooks of the Clearing House, allotted impartially, according to its\r\nstanding, and this credit forms the fixed basis of that firm's\r\ndealings.  If its activities exhaust the line of credit, the Clearing\r\nHouse calls for \"original margins\" at once--a deposit of so-many cents\r\nper bushel for every bushel involved and for every point which the\r\nmarket drops.  The amount per bushel called for is entirely at the\r\ndiscretion of the Clearing House authorities and if the quantity of\r\ngrain reaches dangerous proportions the deposit required may be set so\r\nhigh that it becomes practically equivalent to cash purchase.  To\r\n\"corner the market\" under these conditions would require unlimited\r\ncredit with the Clearing House.\r\n\r\nWhen Jones & Brown are \"called\" for deposit margins they drop\r\neverything and obey.  They have just fifteen minutes to reach the bank\r\nwith that cheque, have it \"marked\" and rushed to the Clearing House.\r\nIf they fail to arrive with it the Manager of the Clearing House will\r\nstep into their office and if there were any \"hemming and hawing\" Jones\r\n& Brown would be reported at once to the Secretary of the Exchange who\r\nwould call a hurry-up meeting of the Exchange Council and Messrs. Jones\r\n& Brown would find themselves posted and all trades with them forbidden.\r\n\r\nAll clerical errors in regard to trades are checked up by the Clearing\r\nHouse and fines paid in for mistakes.  Only a nominal charge is made\r\nfor its services--enough to pay overhead expenses--but the fines have\r\nenabled the Clearing House to accumulate a large Reserve Fund which\r\ngives it financial stability to provide for all responsibilities should\r\noccasion arise through failure of any firm.  All futures which have not\r\nbeen cancelled before delivery date are negotiated through the Clearing\r\nHouse and with its assistance the grain can be placed just where it\r\nshould go and tremendous quantities of it are handled without a hitch\r\nand with the utmost despatch.\r\n\r\nExcitement in the Pit is not always over wheat.  It may be oats.  It\r\nwas Canadian Western Oats which became the storm centre in 1911 when\r\nthe Grain Growers got into difficulty with the \"bears.\"  Traders who\r\nattempt to boost prices are known as \"bulls\"; those who are interested\r\nin depressing the market are \"bears.\"  A trader may be a bear to-day\r\nand a bull to-morrow; thus the opposing groups are constantly changing\r\nin make-up and the firm which was a chief opponent in yesterday's\r\ntrading may be lined up alongside the day following, fighting with\r\ninstead of against.  It is all in the day's business and the strenuous\r\ncompetition on the floor, into which the uninitiated visitor reads all\r\nmanner of animosity and open anger, is a very misleading barometer to\r\nthe actual good feeling which prevails.\r\n\r\nIn recording what now took place in the Pit in connection with the\r\nfarmers' commission agency it will be well to remember that the rest of\r\nthe traders would have acted in the same way toward any firm which was\r\nfool enough to leave the opening for attack.  It may be that as the\r\nthing developed some of those who were specially interested in the\r\ndownfall of the farmers' organization seized the opportunity to ride\r\nthe situation beyond the pale of business ethics and in their eagerness\r\nto be \"in at the death\" revealed special vindictiveness.  But in view\r\nof the long struggle with this element it was only what the Grain\r\nGrowers should have expected when they ran their heads deliberately\r\ninto the noose.\r\n\r\nThe situation was this: Shortly after New Year's the export demand for\r\nCanadian Western Oats became heavy and it looked as if in Great Britain\r\nand all over Europe, where the oat crop had been small, there would\r\ncontinue to be a shortage of oats.  In spite of this situation,\r\nhowever, no sooner was the proposed reciprocity agreement reached\r\nbetween the Canadian and United States governments of the day, on\r\nJanuary 26th, than market prices began to go down.\r\n\r\nThe then Manager of the Grain Growers' Grain Company came to the\r\nconclusion that this price lowering was a local condition and that the\r\nexport market for oats was too strong to justify it or sustain it.\r\n\r\n\"I'll just step into the market and buy some oats,\" said he.  \"Later on\r\nI'll sell for export at a satisfactory figure.\"  Accordingly, one fine\r\nmorning he went into the Pit and began to buy.\r\n\r\nThe Manager's motive in attempting to sustain the market may have been\r\nof the best; but it was the first time that such methods had been\r\nattempted by the Grain Growers--methods which were not at all in\r\nkeeping with the avowed principles of the Company.  The Board of\r\nControl had every confidence in their Manager and, although he was\r\nmerely a salaried employee and not an executive officer, he had been\r\ngiven a pretty free hand in the conduct of the Company's operations.\r\nApparently it did not occur to him that he should consult the Board\r\nbefore entering the market on a speculative basis.  Had the Board known\r\nwhat he was about to do they would have vetoed it; but when they did\r\ndiscover what was afoot it was too late to prevent the situation.  It\r\ndeveloped very swiftly.\r\n\r\n\"The Grain Growers are up to the neck in May oats,\" was the whisper\r\nwhich passed about among the other traders.  That was all that was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"Sell May oats!  Sell May oats!\"\r\n\r\nOn every side of the Pit they were being offered by thousands of\r\nbushels--five--twenty-five--fifty thousand!  The idea was to load up\r\nthe Grain Growers' Grain Company to the point where their line of\r\ncredit with the Clearing House would become exhausted, after which\r\nevery bushel would require a marginal deposit.  Then when the Company\r\ncould carry no further burden the Clearing House would be forced to\r\ndump back the oats onto the market, breaking it several cents per\r\nbushel.  At this lower price the traders who had obligated themselves\r\nto make these big deliveries would buy back the necessary supply of\r\noats at a profit and everything would resume the even tenor of its\r\nway--except the Grain Growers, of course.  Their serviette would be\r\nfolded.  Their chair would be pushed back from the table!  They would\r\nbe _through_!\r\n\r\nUp until now all the troubles of the farmers in marketing their own\r\ngrain may be said to have come from sources outside themselves; but in\r\nthe present instance they had nobody to blame but themselves for the\r\npredicament.  It arose at a time, too, when the other grain dealers\r\nwere beginning to recognize the farmers as a force in the grain\r\nmarket--a force which had come to stay.  It was unfortunate, therefore,\r\nthat just as they were beginning to acquire a standing as a solid and\r\nsensible business concern, the Grain Growers' Grain Company should find\r\nthemselves driven into a corner, their backs to the wall, the focus of\r\npointing fingers and gleeful grins.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a salaried employee, not an officer of the Company, had\r\nacted on his own initiative without the consent of the directors was no\r\nexcuse for a reliable business concern to tender as such.  The first\r\nquestion flung back at them naturally would be: \"Then your 'Board of\r\nControl' doesn't control, eh?\"  For although the Board of Control did\r\nnot know what their Manager was doing until it was too late to prevent\r\nit, they should have known.  That is what they were there for--to\r\nprotect the shareholders from managerial mistakes.\r\n\r\nHowever, there they were.  The only thing they could do was to fight it\r\nout to a finish in the Pit and, if they survived, to see that no\r\nsimilar mistakes occurred in the future.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of rumors were flying about the corridors of the Exchange,\r\ngathering momentum as they passed from lip to lip, swelling with the\r\nheat of the excitement until it was a general guess that the Grain\r\nGrowers must be loaded with anywhere between five and eight million\r\nbushels of oats more than they had been able to sell.\r\n\r\nIt was only a guess, though, and a wild one.  Many traders would have\r\ngiven a good round sum to know exactly how the farmers' company stood\r\non the books of the Clearing House.  Only the Clearing House and the\r\nCompany itself knew the true figures and the Clearing House officials\r\nwere men of the highest integrity who dare not be approached for secret\r\ntips.\r\n\r\nThanks to the splendid export connection which had been built up in the\r\nOld Country and to the equally solid financial relations with the Home\r\nBank, the farmers' agency was selling oats for export very rapidly.  It\r\nbegan to look as if they would get out from under the threatening\r\navalanche without much loss, if any.\r\n\r\nThe Company's old-time enemies apparently saw an opportunity to\r\nundermine its credit at this crisis; for attacks began to appear in\r\nprint--accusations of speculation, of official negligence and so forth.\r\nIf the Grain Growers could be prevented from paying for the large\r\nquantity of oats, delivery of which they would have to take on May 1st\r\nto complete the export sales made during the winter--if they could be\r\nmade to fail in filling these export orders when navigation opened,\r\nthey would be smashed.\r\n\r\nBut in attacking the credit of the Grain Growers, these opponents\r\noverlooked the rapid increase in paid-up capital and the ability of the\r\nfarmers to secure money outside of Winnipeg.  It was not being\r\nforgotten by the Grain Growers that upon the first day of May there\r\nwould be delivered to them over 2,200,000 bushels of oats.\r\n\r\nWhen the day arrived, therefore, the money was on hand to meet every\r\ncontingency.  Every bushel was paid for immediately.  Within a few\r\nweeks half of the quantity was riding the waves of the Atlantic, bound\r\nfor the Old Country to fill part of the sales already made there.\r\n\r\nBefore long some of the grain companies which had sold the oats were\r\ntrying to buy them back.  Had the farmers' company been a speculating\r\nfirm they might have turned upon the market and cornered the oats with\r\na vengeance.  It was one of those rare occasions when a corner could\r\nhave been operated successfully to a golden, no-quarter finish; for the\r\nexport demand was sustained and the local market could have been made\r\nto pay \"through the nose\" for its fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nNEW FURROWS\r\n\r\nFishes, beasts and fowls are to eat each other, for they have no\r\njustice; but to men is given justice, which is for the best.--_Hesiod_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation was changing indeed for the Grain Growers in Western\r\nCanada.  In spite of all opposition the farmers had made themselves a\r\nfactor in the grain trade and had demonstrated their ability to conduct\r\ntheir affairs on sound business principles.  Co-operative marketing of\r\ngrain no longer was an untried idea, advocated by a small group of\r\nenthusiasts.  The manner in which the farmers' pioneer trading agency\r\nhad weathered the stormy conditions of its passage from the beginning\r\nand the dignified stand of its directors--these gradually were earning\r\nstatus in the solid circles of the business world.\r\n\r\nOut in the country also things were different.  Those farmers who at\r\nfirst had been most certain that the trading venture would crumble away\r\nlike so many other organized business efforts of farmers in the past,\r\nnow were ready to admit their error--to admit that a farmers' business\r\norganization, managed by farmers, could succeed in such ample measure\r\nthat its future as a going concern was assured.  Instead of hovering on\r\nthe outskirts of its activities, like small boys surrounding a giant\r\nfire-cracker on Victoria Day--waiting for the loud bang so freely\r\npredicted--these gentlemen were beginning to look upon it as a safe\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Grain Growers' Grain Company was an argument for\r\nco-operation which could not be overlooked and the co-operative spirit\r\nspread rapidly among the farmers in many districts.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the promoters of the grain company had\r\nintended originally to operate under a Dominion charter but were\r\ncompelled by circumstances to content themselves with provincial\r\npowers.  The farmers now were finding themselves too restricted and\r\napplication was made for a new charter which would facilitate the\r\ntransaction of business in other provinces than Manitoba.  Special\r\npowers were asked for and by special Act of Parliament the charter was\r\ngranted in 1911 in the face of considerable opposition at Ottawa from\r\nthose whom the farmers regarded as representing the Canadian\r\nManufacturers' Association and the Retail Merchants' Association.\r\n\r\nFor the trend of the organized farmers was quite apparent.  No secret\r\nhad been made of the views entertained by the Grain Growers regarding\r\nco-operation.  To familiarize every member of the various organizations\r\nwith the history of co-operative achievements in other countries had\r\nbeen the object of many articles in the _Grain Growers' Guide_ and much\r\nspeech-making from time to time.  The possibility of purchasing farm\r\nsupplies co-operatively in addition to co-operative marketing of grain\r\nwas being urged convincingly.  And during the long winter evenings when\r\nthe farmer shoved another stick into the stove it was natural for him\r\nto ask himself questions while he stood in front of it and let the\r\nparing from another Ontario apple dangle into the ash-pan.\r\n\r\n\"The fellow who made that stove paid a profit to the Iron an' Steel\r\nTrust who supplied the raw iron ore,\" considered he.  \"Then he turned\r\naround an' added a profit of his own before he let the wholesaler have\r\nit.  Then the wholesaler chalked up more profit before he shipped it\r\nalong to Joe Green over in town an' Joe just naturally had to soak me\r\nsomething before I got her aboard for home.  That's profits on the\r\nprofits!  It's a hot proposition an' it's my money that goes up the\r\nflue!\"\r\n\r\nWhen he added further profits which he figured might be due to\r\nagreements between supposed competitors in prices, the Grain Grower was\r\nquite ready to believe that he had paid about twice as much for that\r\nstove as the thing would cost him legitimately if he dealt with the\r\nmaker direct.  Here was the High Cost of Living that everybody was\r\ntalking about.  The remedy?  The same chance as the Other Fellow for\r\nthe farmer to use the resources of Nature and, by co-operation, the\r\nreduction to a minimum of production and distribution cost.\r\n\r\n\"I've done it with my grain.  Why can't I do it with what I need to\r\nbuy?\"  That was what the Grain Grower was asking himself.  \"Why must I\r\nfeed and clothe and buy the smokes for so many of these middlemen?\"\r\n\r\nSo when the directors of the grain-trading company came before him with\r\nthe suggestion of buying a timber limit in British Columbia in order to\r\nput in their own saw-mills eventually to supply building materials on\r\nthe prairie, the Grain Grower slapped his leg and said: \"Good boy!  An'\r\nsay, what about a coal mine, too?\"\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of great developments for the organized farmers\r\nof Western Canada.  It was the beginning of new furrows--the opening up\r\nof new vistas of emancipation, as the farmer saw it.  And as the\r\nfurrows lengthened and multiplied they were destined to cause much\r\nheart-burning and antagonism in new directions.\r\n\r\nThe timber limit which the Grain Growers' Grain Company purchased was\r\nestimated to contain two hundred and twenty-two million feet of lumber.\r\nA Co-Operative Department was opened with the manufacture and sale of\r\nmore than 130 carloads of flour at a saving to the farmer of fifty\r\ncents per cwt, even this small beginning registering a drop in milling\r\ncompany prices.  Next they got in touch with the Ontario Fruit Growers'\r\nAssociation and sold over 4,000 bbls. of apples to Western farmers at\r\nthe Eastern growers' carload-lot price, plus freight, plus a commission\r\nof ten cents per barrel.  More than one hundred carloads of coal were\r\nhandled in one month and the farmers then got after the lumber\r\nmanufacturers for lumber by the carload at a saving of several dollars\r\nper thousand feet.\r\n\r\nStill experimenting, the Grain Growers' Grain Company added to the list\r\nof commodities in 1912-13--fence posts, woven fence wire, barbed wire\r\nand binder twine.  Followed other staples--cement, plaster, sash and\r\ndoors, hardware and other builders' supplies; sheet metal roofing and\r\nsiding, shingles, curbing, culverts, portable granaries, etc.; oil,\r\nsalt and other miscellaneous supplies; finally, in 1914-15, farm\r\nmachinery of all kinds, scales, cream separators, sewing machines and\r\neven typewriters.  Of binder twine alone nearly seven million pounds\r\nwas handled during this season.  Thus did co-operative purchasing by\r\nthe farmers pass from experiment to a permanent place in their\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nExpansion was taking place in other directions also.  In 1912 the\r\nCompany leased from the Canadian Pacific Railway a terminal elevator at\r\nFort William, capacity 2,500,000 bushels.  A small cleaning elevator\r\nwas acquired at the same place and, with an eye to possible\r\ndevelopments at the Pacific Coast, a controlling interest in a small\r\nterminal elevator in British Columbia was purchased.  At Port Arthur,\r\non a six-hundred-foot lake frontage, a new elevator has just been built\r\nwith a storage capacity of 600,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nSo much for terminal facilities of this farmers' pioneer trading\r\norganization.  Now, what about the country elevators for government\r\ncontrol of which the farmers had campaigned so vigorously in the three\r\nPrairie Provinces?  As we have seen, the problem had been handled in\r\nSaskatchewan along very different lines to the method adopted in\r\nManitoba.  In Manitoba the 374 elevators, owned by the Provincial\r\nGovernment and operated by the Provincial Elevator Commission, showed a\r\nloss.  It was even hinted in some quarters that the Manitoba Government\r\nhad no intention in the first place of operating at anything but a\r\nloss.  Whether or not there was any ground for these irreverent\r\nsuspicions, the fact remained that the Government elevator system in\r\nManitoba was beginning to assume the bulk of a snow-white elephant.\r\nThe Government, not entering the field as buyers, had tried to run the\r\nelevators as a storage proposition solely.  In 1910-11 the loss had\r\nexceeded $84,000 and the year following was not much better.  At last\r\nthe Government said in effect to the Grain Growers:\r\n\r\n\"We've lost money on this proposition.  We tried it out to please you\r\nfarmers, but you're still dissatisfied.  Try to run 'em yourselves!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll just do that,\" replied the farmers, although the Grain Growers'\r\nGrain Company was not enthusiastic over the prospect of converting the\r\nelevator failure into immediate financial success.\r\n\r\nIt was too much to expect.  At many points the Government owned all the\r\nelevators in sight.  In some places there was too much elevator\r\naccommodation for the district's volume of business.  In certain cases\r\nthe elevators which had been sold to the Government were practically\r\ndiscards to begin with.  However, the need for improvement in the\r\nservice which the farmers were getting at country points was so very\r\ngreat that finally, in 1912, the farmers assumed control of the\r\ngovernment system in Manitoba.\r\n\r\nIt was late in August when this came about.  With only three or four\r\nweeks in which to prepare for the season's crop, make repairs, secure\r\ncompetent managers, travelling superintendents and office staff the\r\nresults of the first season scarcely could offer a fair test.  Even so,\r\nprices for street grain went up at competing points.  Line elevator\r\ncompanies began asking the farmer for his grain instead of merely\r\npermitting him to place it in their elevators.\r\n\r\nThe farmers were quick to note this and asked that the elevator service\r\nbe continued by their company.  With better organization the following\r\nseason brought still greater improvement in service.  Prices rose.  The\r\nspecial binning service from their own elevators the farmers found\r\ngenuine, not just a last-minute privilege granted to secure their\r\ngrain.  In spite of bad crop conditions in 1914-15, the elevators\r\ncontinued to succeed under the farmers' own management and, the year\r\nfollowing, letters of highest praise from farmers everywhere marked the\r\ncomplete success of the undertaking.  So excellent was the service now\r\nbeing rendered by the Company that independent Farmers' Elevators in\r\nseveral instances approached the Grain Growers and sought their\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe handling of co-operative supplies at elevator points began in\r\n1913-14.  Flour houses were erected where prices were out of proportion\r\nand at other places the elevator agents began to arrange for carload\r\nshipments and proper distribution of coal among the farmers at a saving\r\nof from two to three dollars per ton.\r\n\r\nThese co-operative lines at elevator points soon were enlarged with\r\nmuch success.  In addition to the elevators leased from the Manitoba\r\nGovernment the Grain Growers' Grain Company bought outright, erected or\r\nleased sixty elevators of its own.\r\n\r\nThose who were watching all this steadily grew more restive.  The\r\nFarmers' Movement in the West was fast becoming a subject of bitter\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\"When farmers advance to the last furrow of plowed land on the farm\r\nthey breast the fence which skirts the Public Highway,\" argued many Men\r\nof Business.  \"They are climbing over the fence!\"\r\n\r\nBut the organized farmers were not inclined to recognize fences in\r\nrestriction of honest competition.  They believed they were on the Open\r\nRange and held unswervingly on their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA FINAL TEST\r\n\r\nWe sometimes had those little rubs which Providence sends to enhance\r\nthe value of its favors.--_Vicar of Wakefield_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile developing co-operative purchasing of farm supplies the pioneer\r\nbusiness organization of the farmers had continued its policy of\r\nexpansion in the grain business.  The ideal of the farmers had been to\r\nreduce to the lowest possible point the cost between the producer in\r\nWestern Canada and the Old Country consumer who bought most of the\r\nWestern grain.  By engaging in the export business they hoped to become\r\nan influence in keeping export values--the price at Port William, in\r\nother words--at a truer level.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1912 the export activities of the Grain Growers had been\r\nrestricted necessarily to an experimental basis; but on January 1st,\r\n1912, the \"Grain Growers' Export Company,\" as it was called, was\r\norganized for business on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes necessary to record a final test of the Grain Growers'\r\nGrain Company inasmuch as it demonstrated the mettle of the farmers in\r\na significant manner--the test of serious internal disagreement.  Of\r\nall the threatening situations through which this organization had\r\npassed none was more critical than this later development.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was a brew which simmered for some time before the steam of\r\nit permeated beyond directors' meetings.  It began early in 1912 as an\r\naftermath of the unfortunate deal in oats, bubbled along to a boil with\r\nthe fat finally in the fire at the annual meeting of the shareholders.\r\nThe consequences were ladled out during 1913 and the bill was settled\r\nin full at the annual meeting that year with a cheque for nearly a\r\nquarter of a million dollars.\r\n\r\nLike most internal troubles in business organizations the personal\r\nequation entered into it.  Certain of the directors were inclined to\r\ncriticise other directors and to be somewhat dictatory as to how the\r\nfarmers' business should be conducted.  With the idea of improving the\r\nsystem of management, the directors at this stage abolished the Board\r\nof Control and the President was made Managing-Director with\r\nsupervisory and disciplinary powers.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, at a special meeting of the directors to consider\r\nfuture management, four of the nine directors introduced a resolution\r\nto declare the position of Managing-Director vacant.  They failed to\r\ncarry it--and promptly resigned.\r\n\r\nThis occurred in March.  In the June columns of the _Guide_ these four\r\ndirectors addressed an open letter to the shareholders, urging full\r\nrepresentation at the forthcoming annual meeting in order that their\r\ncriticisms might be threshed out.  President Crerar joined in the\r\nrequest for a full meeting of shareholders.  If the loyalty or ability\r\nof any director was to be questioned because he refused to surrender\r\nhis judgment to other directors who might disagree with him on certain\r\nmatters, it was time to have an understanding.  So far as he was\r\nconcerned, he could not agree to become a mere speaking-tube for others\r\nwho might want their own way against his own convictions of what was in\r\nthe best interests of the farmers.\r\n\r\nWhen the annual meeting opened, on July 16th, there was a record\r\nattendance of shareholders and during the routine preliminaries it was\r\nevident that expectancy was on tip-toe among the farmers.  The split in\r\nthe directorate was a vital matter.\r\n\r\nIn delivering his annual address the President detailed the business of\r\nthe organization for the past year, referring but briefly to the facts\r\nwhich had led up to the resignation of the four directors.  The\r\nShareholders' Auditor followed with the balance sheet, giving detailed\r\naccounts of receipts, expenditures, assets and liabilities; he answered\r\nall questions asked.  Then came a resolution, expressing the thanks of\r\nthe shareholders to the President--and this moment was chosen by the\r\nleader of the revolt to spin his pin-wheels.\r\n\r\nThe debate began at three o'clock in the afternoon.  It did not end\r\nuntil ten at night.  The President retired from the chair and the\r\nAuditor was called on for detailed information, covering a period of\r\nseveral years past.  In the long speech which was then made by the\r\nleader of the critics the President was declared responsible for all\r\nthe alleged mismanagement and his retention in office undesirable.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of everyone a fifth director now took the floor and\r\njoined the attack.  Not having been one of the four directors who\r\nresigned, this new criticism was unexpected and the tension of the\r\nmeeting grew.  After amusing himself and the audience for awhile with a\r\nhumorous speech, No. 5 ended by suggesting that the President was not\r\nsufficiently wicked to be driven from office.\r\n\r\nArose the remaining three members of the resigning quartette and, one\r\nafter another, had their say.  Finally, when words failed them and they\r\nrested their case, the President spoke briefly.\r\n\r\nIn the annual address, which he had delivered that morning, no attempt\r\nhad been made to deny the inadequacy of the Company's office\r\norganization to cope with the exceptional crop conditions of 1911 and\r\n1912.  The latter season particularly had been very trying owing to the\r\nlateness of the crop and the wet harvesting conditions.  Twenty-five\r\nper cent. of the grain, which started for market a month late, was\r\ntough, damp or wet.  The arrival of snow had prevented hundreds of\r\nthousands of acres from being threshed and, on top of it all, railway\r\ntraffic had become congested so that cars of grain got lost for weeks\r\nand even months and there were long delays in getting the outturns of\r\ncars after they were unloaded.  Money was scarce and farmers who were\r\nbeing pressed for liabilities to merchants, banks and machinery\r\ncompanies found it hard to get cars; naturally, once they had shipped,\r\nthey were in no mood for further delays.\r\n\r\nOwing to the condition of the grain, too, the grading was so uncertain\r\nthat exceptional care had been necessary in accepting bank drafts on\r\ncarloads of grain for amounts nearly double their possible value under\r\nthe unusual current crop conditions.  Even with the greatest care the\r\nCompany found that in many instances they had given greater advances\r\nthan were realized when the cars were sold.  The refusal of drafts,\r\npassed by some local banks for amounts the managers should have known\r\ncould not be met, led to many hard things being said against the\r\nfarmers' agency.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions it was only to be expected that the work in the\r\noffice would become congested badly for weeks at a stretch.  Double the\r\namount of work was entailed in handling a given quantity of grain,\r\ncompared to the season before.  The Company was handicapped for office\r\nspace also and errors were bound to occur in a business involving so\r\nmuch detail that a simple mistake might lead to infinite trouble.\r\nCorrespondence had not been answered as promptly as it should have\r\nbeen, the necessary information regarding shipments being unavailable.\r\n\r\nAll of these things had been met frankly in the President's annual\r\naddress and now when he brought the day's animated debate to a close he\r\nadded merely a word or two regarding the strong financial position to\r\nwhich the farmers' pioneer trading organization had won its way in the\r\ncommercial world.  He pointed out the future that lay before it.  Upon\r\npersonal attacks he did not comment at all.\r\n\r\nImmediately a unanimous vote of thanks for his untiring work and\r\nloyalty was tendered Mr. Crerar.  The debate was over.  The following\r\nmorning the officers for the ensuing year were chosen and only one of\r\nthe four directors who had resigned from the old Board was re-elected.\r\nHe withdrew and the whole incident was closed.\r\n\r\nBut the real test was yet to come.  The withdrawal of the four\r\ndirectors had left but five to cope with the difficult situation of the\r\nExport Company.  It had found itself with a large amount of ocean\r\nfreight on its hands--freight which had been secured on favorable terms\r\nfrom shipping agents for use later in transporting grain which the\r\nfarmers' agency expected to sell in the Old Country.  It was decided to\r\ncut off the export business entirely for the time being and to re-let\r\nthe ocean shipping space to other exporters.  The price of ocean\r\nfreight fluctuated to such an extent, however, that rather than accept\r\nan immediate loss it was thought better to use the freight, after all,\r\nmaking shipment to fill.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the sixth annual meeting the Export Company had stood\r\nabout level on the books; but during the two succeeding months the\r\ngrain shipped from Fort William went out of condition while crossing\r\nthe ocean and when it arrived in port the Old Country buyers refused to\r\nlook at it.  Heavy charges had to be met in treating to bring it to\r\nsale condition and very heavy losses were incurred.  Before the matter\r\nwas cleaned up finally these losses totalled more than $230,000.\r\n\r\nWhen a quarter of a million dollars has been expended in a direction\r\nwhere tangible results have not been in evidence--when it has been\r\nsacrificed apparently for the sake of a principle--then does the manner\r\nin which such a loss is accepted become significant.  The exporting of\r\ngrain had begun to receive particular attention from the shareholders\r\nof the Grain Growers' Grain Company following the season of 1907-8 when\r\nthey discovered the apparent margin of profit in the export business\r\nduring much of the season to be from eight to twelve cents per bushel.\r\nThis had been due, no doubt, to the fact that it was a time of\r\nfinancial stringency and only a few exporting firms could get the money\r\nnecessary to carry on the business.  The export value of grain, the\r\nfarmers had figured, should be its value in the world's markets, less\r\nthe cost of delivering it.  By engaging in the export business,\r\nobtaining their cable offers regularly from the Old Country, they felt\r\nthat their competition would be a factor in governing the prices paid\r\nthe farmer, thereby benefiting every farmer in the West.\r\n\r\nThat this had been accomplished the shareholders of the trading company\r\nwere convinced.  Therefore, instead of losing their heads as well as\r\nthis large sum of money, they examined the situation coolly and sanely,\r\nmaking up their minds that the loss was due to the grain going out of\r\ncondition because of the unusual weather which had characterized the\r\nseason.  No doubt the executive and directors had been handicapped by\r\ntheir lack of knowledge as to the methods and manner in which the\r\nexport business was done; but that was to be expected and only by\r\nexperience could they learn.\r\n\r\n\"Can the export part of our business be developed successfully with a\r\nlittle more time?\" asked the farmers.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we believe so,\" replied their officers.\r\n\r\n\"That's all we want to know.  Write a cheque to cover this loss,\r\nreorganize the Export Company and stick to it.\"\r\n\r\nThis faith in their officers, in themselves and in the cause they had\r\nat heart was justified within the next two seasons when success was\r\nachieved with the subsidiary concern and the farmers were able to\r\ncongratulate themselves that they had been sufficiently level-headed\r\nnot to allow themselves to be stampeded from the exporting field\r\naltogether to the great weakening of their influence.\r\n\r\nThe accomplishments of the Grain Growers in marketing their own grain\r\ncannot be dismissed with careless gesture.  Their severest critic must\r\nadmit that the manner in which the farmers conducted themselves in the\r\nface of the situation that threatened entitles them to respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE, IN SASKATCHEWAN--\r\n\r\nAn old man on the point of death summoned his sons around him to give\r\nthem some parting advice.  He ordered his servants to bring in a faggot\r\nof sticks, and said to his eldest son: Break it.  The son strained and\r\nstrained, but with all his efforts was unable to break the bundle.  The\r\nother sons also tried, but none of them was successful.  Untie the\r\nfaggots, said the father, and each of you take a stick.  When they had\r\ndone so, he called out to them: Now break; and each stick was easily\r\nbroken.  You see my meaning, said their father.  Let affection bind you\r\nto one another.  Together you are strong; separated you are\r\nweak.--_Aesop_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventful years, these through which the Grain Growers of Western Canada\r\nwere passing.  While the Grain Growers' Grain Company was undertaking\r\nthe initial experiments in co-operative purchasing of farm supplies,\r\nshowing the Manitoba Government that farmers could run elevators\r\nsatisfactorily and fighting its way forward to success in the exporting\r\nfield, how were things getting along in Saskatchewan?  With $52,000 and\r\nanother four or five hundred in loose change tucked away in its hip\r\npocket as the net profit of its first season's operations the new\r\nsystem of co-operative elevators had struck out \"on a bee line\" for\r\nSuccess and was swinging along at a steady gait, full of confidence.\r\nThe volume of business handled through these elevators the first year\r\nhad been affected by the failure of the contractors to finish\r\nconstruction of all the elevators by the dates specified.  Even so, the\r\nnew company had handled 3,261,000 bushels of grain, more than half of\r\nit being special binned.\r\n\r\nIn planning to build eighty-eight new elevators in 1912 and to purchase\r\nsix, thereby bringing the total to 140 co-operative elevators, the\r\ndirectors thought it wise to form a construction department of their\r\nown instead of relying upon outside contractors.  Also it was decided\r\nto open a commission department of their own at Winnipeg, the volume of\r\nbusiness in sight being very encouraging.  This move was not made,\r\nhowever, because of any dissatisfaction with the Grain Growers' Grain\r\nCompany's services as selling agent; on the other hand, although crop\r\nconditions had been perhaps the most unfavorable in the history of\r\nSaskatchewan and the grain with its diversity of grades therefore very\r\ndifficult to market satisfactorily, the Board of Directors acknowledged\r\nin their annual report that the wisdom of the arrangement with the\r\nGrain Growers' Grain Company had been proved by the satisfactory\r\nworking of it.\r\n\r\nThe volume of business handled by the 137 elevators in operation the\r\nsecond year jumped to 12,900,000 bushels with a net profit of\r\napproximately $168,000, and it was apparent that the general acceptance\r\nof the co-operative scheme throughout the province would mean\r\norganization upon a large scale.  This was emphasized during the 1913\r\ngrain season when 192 elevators were in operation and about 19,500,000\r\nbushels of grain were hauled in to the co-operative elevators by\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nThis rapid expansion of the Saskatchewan Co-Operative Elevator Company\r\nwas entailing such an increase in staff organization that it became\r\nnecessary to provide special office accommodation.  Accordingly a site\r\nfor a permanent building of their own was purchased in 1914 at Regina\r\nand the following year a modern, fireproof building was erected.  It\r\nstands two storeys on a high basement, with provision for additional\r\nstoreys, occupies a space of 9,375 square feet, has interior finish of\r\noak and architecturally it is a matter of pride to the farmers who own\r\nit.  This building has become the headquarters of the Saskatchewan\r\nCo-Operative Elevator Company and likewise the Saskatchewan Grain\r\nGrowers' Association, the offices of the latter occupying the entire\r\ntop floor.\r\n\r\nWhile the erection of this building afforded visible proof of financial\r\nprogress the Saskatchewan farmers were warned by the directors and the\r\ngeneral manager of the \"Co-Op\" that co-operation which was allowed to\r\ndegenerate into mere production of dividends would but reproduce in\r\nanother form the evil it was intended to destroy.  The ideal of service\r\nwas the vital force which must be kept in mind and the work of the\r\nGrain Growers' Association in fostering this ideal must be encouraged.\r\n\r\n\"The Association has its great work of organization, education and\r\nagitation,\" stated Charles A. Dunning, the elevator company's manager,\r\n\"and the company the equally great work of giving practical effect to\r\nthe commercial and co-operative ideals of the Association, both\r\ninstitutions being branches of one united Farmers' Movement having for\r\nits object the social and economic uplift of the farming industry.\"\r\n\r\nNot a little of the early success of the Saskatchewan Co-Operative\r\nElevator Company was due to the energy and business ability which\r\nDunning brought to bear upon its organization and development.  The\r\nstory of this young homesteader's rise from the ranks of the Grain\r\nGrowers is worth noting.  It was back in 1902 that he first reached the\r\nWest--a seventeen-year-old Englishman, \"green\" as the grass that grew\r\nover there in Leicester.  He did not know anything then about the\r\nhistoric meeting of pioneer grain growers which Motherwell and Dayman\r\nhad assembled not long before at Indian Head.  He was concerned chiefly\r\nwith finding work on a farm somewhere and hired out near Yorkton,\r\nSaskatchewan, for ten dollars a month.  After awhile he secured one of\r\nthe Government's 160-acre slices of homestead land and proceeded to\r\ndemonstrate that oxen could haul wheat twenty-five miles to a railway\r\nif their driver sat long enough on the load.\r\n\r\nThere came a day when Dunning, filled with a new feeling of\r\nindependence, started for Yorkton with a load of wheat and oats.  It\r\nwas along towards spring when the snow was just starting to go and at a\r\nnarrow place in the trail, as luck would have it, he met a farmer\r\nreturning from town with an empty sleigh.  In trying to pass the other\r\nfellow Dunning's sleigh upset.  While helping to reload the farmer\r\nimparted the information that oats were selling for eight cents and all\r\nhe had been able to get for his wheat was something like thirteen cents\r\nin Yorkton the day before!  The young Englishman's new feeling of\r\n\"independence\" slid into his shoe-packs as he stared speechless at his\r\nneighbor.  Right-about went his oxen and back home he hauled his load,\r\nangry and dismayed and realizing that something was wrong with Western\r\nconditions that could bring about such treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen a branch of the Grain Growers' Association was formed at\r\nBeaverdale, not far from his homestead, it is scarcely necessary to say\r\nthat young Dunning joined and took an active part in the debates.\r\nFinally he was chosen as delegate for the district at the annual Grain\r\nGrowers' convention at Prince Albert on condition that he could finance\r\nthe trip on $17.50.  The story is told that Dunning figured by making\r\nfriends with the furnace man of one of the hotels he might be allowed\r\nto sleep in the cellar for the week he would be in Prince Albert and\r\nmanage to get through on this meagre expense fund!  At any rate he did\r\nfind a place to lay his head and, if reports be true, actually came\r\nback with money in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIt was at this convention that the young man first attracted attention.\r\nThe delegates had deadlocked over a discussion in regard to a scheme\r\nfor insuring crops against hailstorms in Saskatchewan, half of them\r\nfavoring it and half opposing it.  The young homesteader from\r\nBeaverdale got up, ran his fingers through his pompadour and outlined\r\nthe possibilities of co-operative insurance which would apply only to\r\nmunicipalities where a majority of the farmers favored the idea.  He\r\ntalked so convincingly and sanely that the convention elected him as a\r\ndirector of the Association and later when the co-operative elevator\r\nscheme was broached he was elected vice-president of the Association\r\nand the suggestion was made that he undertake the work of organizing\r\nthe new elevator concern.  Incidentally, the man who suggested this was\r\nE. A. Partridge, of Sintaluta--the same Partridge who had fathered the\r\nGrain Growers' Grain Company and who already had located T. A. Crerar,\r\nof Russell, Manitoba.\r\n\r\nOut of Dunning's suggestion at Prince Albert grew the Saskatchewan Hail\r\nInsurance Commission which was recommended to the Provincial Government\r\nby the Association in 1911 and brought into operation the following\r\nyear.  The legislation provided for municipal co-operative hail\r\ninsurance on the principle of a provincial tax made operative by local\r\noption.  Twenty-five or more rural municipalities having agreed to join\r\nto insure against hail the crops within the municipalities, authority\r\nwould be granted to collect a special tax--not to exceed four cents per\r\nacre--on all land in the municipalities concerned.  Administration\r\nwould be in the hands of the Hail Insurance Commission, which would set\r\nthe rate of the special tax.  All claims and expenses would be paid\r\nfrom the pooled fund and all crops in the respective municipalities\r\nwould be insured automatically.  If damage by hail occurred insurance\r\nwould be paid at the rate of five dollars per acre when crop was\r\ndestroyed completely and _pro rata_ if only partially destroyed.  This\r\nco-operative insurance scheme was instituted successfully in the fall\r\nof 1912, soon spread throughout Saskatchewan and was destined\r\neventually to carry more than twenty-five million dollars of hail\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nShortly after the launching of co-operative hail insurance the\r\ndiscussions among the Saskatchewan farmers in regard to the\r\nco-operative purchasing of farm commodities for their own use came to a\r\nhead in a request to the Provincial Government for the widening of\r\ncharter powers in order that the Association might organize a\r\nco-operative trading department.  In 1913 authorization to act as a\r\nmarketing and purchasing agent for registered co-operative associations\r\nwas granted and next year the privilege was extended to include local\r\ngrain growers' associations.\r\n\r\nThus the Trading Department of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers'\r\nAssociation takes the form of a Central Office, or wholesale body,\r\nthrough which all the Locals can act collectively in dealing with\r\nminers, millers, manufacturers, etc.  The Central sells to organized\r\nLocals only, they in turn selling to their members.  The surplus\r\nearnings of the Central are distributed to the Locals which have\r\ninvested capital in their Central, such distribution being made in\r\nproportion to the amount of business done with the Central by the\r\nrespective Locals.\r\n\r\nDuring its first season of co-operative purchasing the Association\r\nhandled 25,000 tons of coal and in a year or two there was turned over\r\nin a season enough binder twine to bind fifty million bushels of\r\ngrain--about 4,500,000 pounds of twine.  When the Western potato crop\r\nfailed in 1915 the Association imported four and one-half million\r\nbushels of potatoes for its members, cutting the market price in some\r\ncases a dollar per bushel.  Flour, apples, cord-wood, building\r\nsupplies, vegetables and groceries likewise were purchased and\r\ndistributed co-operatively.  The savings effected by the farmers cannot\r\nbe tallied alone from actual quantities of goods thus purchased through\r\ntheir own organization but must include a large aggregate saving due to\r\nreduction of prices by outside dealers.\r\n\r\nSuch commodities as coal and flour being best distributed through local\r\nwarehouses, it is likely that eventually the Saskatchewan Co-Operative\r\nElevator Company will take a hand in helping the Association and the\r\nLocals with the handling of co-operative supplies by furnishing the\r\nlarge capital investment needed to establish these warehouses.\r\n\r\nThe necessary financial strength to accomplish this is readily\r\nconceived to be available after a glance at later developments in\r\nSaskatchewan.  The co-operative elevators now exceed 300.  The figures\r\nfor the season of 1915-16 show a total of more than 39,000,000 bushels\r\nof grain handled with an additional 4,109,000 bushels shipped over the\r\nloading platforms.  Without deducting war-tax the total profit earned\r\nby the Saskatchewan company within the year was in the neighborhood of\r\nthree-quarters of a million dollars.  The Saskatchewan Co-Operative\r\nElevator Company in 1916 began building its own terminal elevator at\r\nPort Arthur with a capacity of 2,500,000 bushels.  By this time there\r\nwere 18,000 shareholders with a subscribed capital of $3,358,900, of\r\nwhich $876,000 was paid up.\r\n\r\nIn these later years a remarkable development is recorded also by the\r\nSaskatchewan Grain Growers' Association until it is by far the largest\r\nand best organized secular body in the province with over 1,300 Locals\r\nand a membership exceeding 28,000.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Association--J. B. Musselman, himself a\r\nfarmer--has done much hard work in office and looks forward to the time\r\nwhen the Locals will own their own breeding stock, assemble and fatten\r\ntheir own poultry, handle and ship their eggs, operate their own\r\nco-operative laundries and bakeries, kill and cure meat in co-operative\r\nbutcher-shops for their own use--have meeting places, rest rooms, town\r\noffices, libraries, moving-pictures and phonographs with which to\r\nentertain and inform themselves.  To stand with a hand on the hilt of\r\nsuch a dream is to visualize a revolution in farm and community\r\nlife--such a revolution as would switch much attraction from city to\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhatever the future may hold in store, the fact remains that already\r\nmuch valuable legislation has been secured from the Government of\r\nSaskatchewan by the farmers.  Perhaps in no other province are the\r\nGrain Growers in as close touch with the Government, due to the nature\r\nof the co-operative enterprises which have been launched with\r\nGovernment support financially.  Three members of the cabinet are men\r\nwho have been identified closely with the Grain Growers' Movement.\r\nHon. W. R. Motherwell has held portfolio as Minister of Agriculture for\r\nmany years.  Hon. George Langley, Minister of Municipal Affairs, helped\r\nto organize the farmers of Northern Saskatchewan in the early days.\r\nFinally in 1916 C. A. Dunning[1] resigned as general manager of the\r\nSaskatchewan Co-Operative Elevator Company to become the youngest\r\nProvincial Treasurer in Canada; for already the Saskatchewan Government\r\nhad called upon him for service on two official commissions to\r\ninvestigate agriculture and finance in most of the European countries\r\nand his services were valuable.\r\n\r\nLangley has been a prominent figure in Saskatchewan affairs ever since\r\nhis arrival in the country in 1903.  He was forty-one years old when he\r\ncame and he brought with him long training as a public speaker, a\r\nknowledge of human nature and a ready twinkle in his eye for everything\r\nhumorous.  According to himself, his first job was chasing sparrows\r\nfrom the crops.  After leaving the English rural life in which he was\r\nreared, he had worked on the London docks and as a London business man.\r\nIn politics he became a disciple of the Cobden-Bright school and was\r\none of the first members of the Fabian Society under the leadership of\r\nthe redoubtable Bernard Shaw.  It was Langley's habit, it is said, to\r\ntalk to London crowds on side thoroughfares, standing on a soap-box and\r\nringing a hand-bell to attract attention.\r\n\r\nIn becoming a Western Canadian farmer it did not take him long to slip\r\naround behind the problems of the farming class; for there was no\r\ngreater adept at poking a cantankerous problem about with a sharp stick\r\nthan the Honorable George.  It was natural for this short, stout,\r\nbearded Englishman to gravitate into the first Legislature of the\r\nnewly-formed Province of Saskatchewan and just as naturally he moved up\r\nto a place in the cabinet.\r\n\r\nAs one of the sponsors of the co-operative elevator scheme, by virtue\r\nof his place on the commission which recommended it, Langley has taken\r\nmuch interest in the co-operative activities of the farmers and on many\r\noccasions has acted as their spokesman.\r\n\r\nWith the relationships outlined it was to be expected that now and then\r\nopponents would hint that the Saskatchewan authorities had played\r\npolitics with the farmers.  Such charges, of course, are refuted\r\nindignantly.  Knowing the widespread desire among the farmers\r\nthemselves to keep free from political alliances, it would be a foolish\r\ngovernment indeed which would fail to recognize that not to play\r\npolitics was the best kind of politics that could be played.\r\n\r\nOther leaders of sterling worth have contributed to the acknowledged\r\nsuccess of co-operation in Saskatchewan, not forgetting John A. Maharg\r\nwho came from Western Ontario in 1890 to settle near Moose Jaw.  From\r\nthe very beginning J. A. Maharg has worked for the cause of the\r\nfarmers.  A pioneer himself, he has a deep understanding of the Western\r\nCanadian farmers' problems and his devotion to their solution has\r\nearned him universal appreciation among the Grain Growers of\r\nSaskatchewan.  Year after year he has been elected to the highest\r\noffice in the gift of the Association.  He has been President many\r\ntimes of both the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association and the\r\nSaskatchewan Co-Operative Elevator Company.\r\n\r\nThe Grain Growers' Movement, then, in this Province of Saskatchewan\r\nwhere it had its beginning, has grown to wonderful proportions with the\r\npassing of the years.  Co-operation has been a pronounced success.  The\r\nold conditions have passed far back down the trail.  The new order of\r\nthings has been fought for by men who have known the taste of smoky\r\ntea, the sour sweat of toil upon the land, the smell of the smudge\r\nfires on a still evening and the drive of the wind on the open plain.\r\nOut of the pioneer past they have stepped forward to the larger\r\nopportunities of the times--times which call for clear heads and wise\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nFor as they build for the future so will the Sons of the Movement watch\r\nand learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Union Government at Ottawa decided in February, 1918, to\r\nreplace the office of Food Controller by the Canada Food Board,\r\norganized as a branch of the Dominion Department of Agriculture under\r\nHon. T. A. Crerar.  Hon. Charles A. Dunning was selected as Director of\r\nProduction.  The other members of the Canada Food Board were: H. B.\r\nThomson, Chairman and Director of Conservation; J. D. McGregor,\r\nDirector of Agricultural Labor.  (Mr. McGregor resigned after a year in\r\noffice.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENED IN ALBERTA\r\n\r\n  Beyond the fields we plough are others waiting,\r\n    The fallows of the ages all unknown.\r\n  Beyond the little harvests we are reaping\r\n    Are wider, grander harvests to be grown.\r\n           --_Gerald J. Lively._\r\n\r\n\r\nOut in the great Range Country all this time the United Farmers were\r\nlickety-loping along the trail of difficulties that carried their own\r\nspecial brand.  The round-up revealed increasing opportunities for\r\nservice and one by one their problems were cut out from the general\r\nherd, roped, tied and duly attended to for the improvement of\r\nconditions in Alberta.  Here and there a difficulty persisted in\r\nbreaking away and running about bawling; but even these finally were\r\ncoralled.\r\n\r\nAlong with the Grain Growers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan the United\r\nFarmers of Alberta had campaigned consistently for government ownership\r\nof elevators, both provincial and terminal.  They had received\r\nassurance from Premier Rutherford that if a satisfactory scheme could\r\nbe evolved, the Provincial Government was prepared to carry out the\r\nestablishment of a line of internal elevators in Alberta.  It looked as\r\nif all that remained to be done was to follow the lead of Manitoba or\r\nSaskatchewan.\r\n\r\nBut on careful consideration neither of the plans followed in the other\r\ntwo provinces appeared to fit the special needs of the Alberta farmers.\r\nThe province at the western end of the grain fields accordingly\r\nexperienced quite a delay in obtaining elevator action.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the discussion of terminal storage facilities was going\r\non at Ottawa.  The need for such facilities at Calgary and Vancouver\r\nwas pressed by the Alberta representatives on various farmer\r\ndelegations and finally the Dominion Government declared its intention\r\nof establishing internal elevators with full modern equipment at Moose\r\nJaw and Saskatoon in Saskatchewan and at Calgary in Alberta; a Dominion\r\nGovernment terminal elevator at the Pacific Coast likewise was on the\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\nBy this time the government operation of the Manitoba elevators had\r\nproved a complete failure and they had been leased by the Grain\r\nGrowers' Grain Company.  In Saskatchewan, however, the co-operative\r\nelevators were proving successful.\r\n\r\nA close study of the co-operative scheme adopted in the province just\r\neast of them enabled the United Farmers of Alberta to work out a plan\r\nalong similar lines.  This was presented to the Premier, whose name\r\nmeanwhile had changed from Rutherford to Sifton.  The Act incorporating\r\nthe Alberta Farmers' Co-Operative Elevator Company, Limited, was\r\ndrafted in the spring of 1913 and passed unanimously by the\r\nLegislature.  The new company held its first meeting in August, elected\r\nits officers[1] and went to work enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided by the United Farmers that full control and\r\nresponsibility must rest in their own hands.  They proposed to provide\r\nthe means for raising at each point where an elevator was built\r\nsufficient funds to finance the purchase of grain at that point from\r\ntheir own resources, at the same time providing for the handling of\r\nother business than grain.\r\n\r\nUnder the Act the Provincial Government made cash advance of\r\neighty-five per cent. of the cost of each elevator built or bought by\r\nthe Company, but had no say whatever as to whether any particular\r\nelevator should be bought or built at any particular place, what it\r\nshould cost or what its capacity or equipment should be.  In security\r\nfor the loan the Government took a first mortgage on the elevator and\r\nother property of the Company at the given point.  The loans on\r\nelevators were repayable in twenty equal annual instalments.\r\n\r\nThe Company started off with the organization of forty-six Locals\r\ninstead of the twenty which the Act called for and the construction of\r\nforty-two elevators was rushed.  Ten additional elevators were bought.\r\nAlthough construction was not completed in time to catch the full\r\nseason's business the number of bushels handled was 3,775,000, the\r\nGrain Growers' Grain Company acting as selling agent.  By the end of\r\nthe second year twenty-six more elevators had been built and the volume\r\nof grain handled had expanded to 5,040,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nNow, this progress had been achieved in the face of continuous\r\ndifficulties of one kind and another.  Chief of these was the attempt\r\nto finance such a large amount of grain upon a small paid-up capital.\r\nThe Company found that after finishing construction of the elevators\r\nthey had no money with which to buy grain nor any assets available for\r\nbank borrowings.  It was impossible to obtain credit upon the unpaid\r\ncapital stock.  The Provincial Government was approached for a\r\nguarantee of the account along the lines followed in Saskatchewan; but\r\nthe Government refused to assume the responsibility.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that the enemies of co-operation were afforded\r\na practical demonstration of the fact that they had to deal not with\r\nany one farmers' organization but with them all.  For the Grain\r\nGrowers' Grain Company stepped into the breach with its powerful\r\nfinancial assistance.\r\n\r\nThe Alberta farmers were clamoring for the handling of farm supplies as\r\nwell as grain; so that the young trading company in Alberta had its\r\nhands more than full to organize a full stride in usefulness from the\r\nstart.  The organization of the United Farmers of Alberta was growing\r\nvery rapidly and the co-operative spirit was tremendously strong\r\nthroughout the province.  There was a demand for the handling of\r\nlivestock shipments and soon it was necessary to establish a special\r\nLivestock Department.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that one of the subjects in which the Alberta\r\nfarmers were interested from the first was the possibility of\r\npersuading the Provincial Government to undertake a co-operative\r\npork-packing plant.  Following the report of the Pork Commission upon\r\nthe matter, however, official action on the part of the authorities had\r\nlanguished.  The various committees appointed from year to year by the\r\nUnited Farmers gradually had acquired much valuable data and at last\r\nwere forced to the conclusion that the development of a packing\r\nindustry along co-operative lines was not so simple as it had appeared\r\nat first.  Even in much older settled countries than Alberta the\r\nquestion, they found, had its complications.  The first thing to\r\ndiscover was whether the farmers of a community were able and willing\r\nto adjust themselves to the requirements of an association for shipping\r\nstock together in carload lots to be sold at the large markets.  Until\r\nsuch demonstration had been made it seemed advisable to defer the\r\norganization of a co-operative packing business.\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the Co-Operative Elevator Company, therefore,\r\nthe Alberta farmers proceeded to encourage the co-operative shipment of\r\nlivestock on consignment by their local unions.  The Livestock\r\nDepartment entered the field first as buyers of hogs, handling 16,000\r\nhogs in the first four months.  The experiment bettered prices by\r\nhalf-a-cent per pound and the expansion of the Department began in\r\nearnest the following season when nearly 800 cars of hogs, cattle and\r\nsheep were handled.\r\n\r\nOn top of all the other troubles of the first year the farmers lost a\r\nvaluable leader in the death of the president of the Co-Operative\r\nElevator Company, W. J. Tregillus.  Complete re-organization of the\r\nExecutive was made and the question of his successor was considered\r\nfrom every angle.  It was vital that no mistake be made in this\r\nconnection and two of the directors were sent to study the business\r\nmethods and policies of the Grain Growers' Grain Company and the\r\nSaskatchewan Co-Operative Elevator Company and to secure a General\r\nManager.  They failed to get in touch with anyone to fill the\r\nrequirements and the management of both the other farmers' concerns\r\nexpressed grave doubts as to the wisdom of a farmers' company looking\r\nfor a manager whose training had been received with line elevator\r\ncompanies and who had not seen things from the farmer's side.\r\n\r\nOne of the remarkable features of the advance of the Farmers' Movement\r\nhas been the manner in which strong leaders have stepped from their own\r\nranks to meet every need.  It has been a policy of the organized\r\nfarmers to encourage the younger men to apply themselves actively in\r\nthe work in order that they might be qualified to take up the\r\nresponsibilities of office when called upon.  There are many\r\noutstanding examples of the wisdom of this in the various farmers'\r\nexecutives to-day; so that with the on-coming of the years there is\r\nlittle danger that sane, level-headed management will pass.  Several of\r\nthe men occupying prominent places to-day in the Farmers' Movement have\r\ngrown up entirely under its tutelage.\r\n\r\nSo it turned out that in Alberta the man the farmers were seeking was\r\none of themselves--one of the two directors sent out to locate a\r\nmanager, in fact.  His name was C. Rice-Jones.  His father was an\r\nEnglish Church clergyman whose work lay in the slum districts of\r\nLondon.  This may have had something to do with the interest which the\r\nyoung man had in social problems.  When at the age of sixteen he became\r\na Canadian and went to work on various farms, finally homesteading in\r\nAlberta, that interest he carried with him.  Out of his own experiences\r\nhe began to apply it in practical ways and the Farmers' Movement drew\r\nhim as a magnet draws steel.  He became identified with the Veteran\r\ndistrict eventually and there organized a local union.  It was not long\r\nbefore he was in evidence in the wider field of the United Farmers'\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nFortunately the new President and General Manager of the Alberta\r\nFarmers' Co-Operative Elevator Company was not a man to lose his sense\r\nof direction in a muddle of affairs.  Into the situation which awaited\r\nhim he waded with consummate tact, discernment and push; so that it was\r\nnot long before his associates were pulling with him for the fullest\r\nweight of intelligent effort.  The difficulties were sorted and sifted\r\nand classified, the machinery oiled and running true, and with a\r\nvaluable directorate at his back Rice-Jones \"made good.\"\r\n\r\nThe third season of the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company\r\nbrought the final proof that the farmers knew how to support their own\r\ninstitutions.  For through the 87 elevators that the farmers operated\r\nin Alberta flowed a total of nearly twenty million bushels of grain,\r\nwith well over ten and one-quarter million bushels handled on\r\ncommission.  The Livestock Department in the face of severe competition\r\nachieved a permanent place in the livestock business of the province\r\nwith offices of its own in the stock yards at Calgary and Edmonton.  By\r\nthis time livestock shipments had amounted to a value in excess of two\r\nmillion dollars.  The Co-Operative Department had handled farm supplies\r\nto a total turnover of approximately $750,000.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the Grain Growers' Grain Company and the Saskatchewan\r\nGrain Growers' Association's trading department the list of articles\r\npurchased co-operatively by the Alberta farmers grew very rapidly to\r\ninclude flour, feed, binder twine, coal, lumber and fence posts, wire\r\nfencing, fruit and vegetables, hay, salt, etc.  In 1915-16 a thousand\r\ncars of these goods were purchased and distributed co-operatively,\r\nbesides which a considerable volume of business was done in\r\nless-than-carload lots.  Coal sheds were built in connection with many\r\nelevators, the staff increased and the entire Co-Operative Department\r\nthoroughly organized for prompt and satisfactory service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix--Par. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nIN THE DRAG OF THE HARROWS\r\n\r\n    \"I see the villain in your face!\"\r\n    \"May it plaze yer worship, that must be a\r\n  personal reflection, sure.\"\r\n            --_Irish Wit and Humor (Howe)._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"good old days\" when the Farmer was a poor sheep without a\r\nshepherd, shorn to the pink hide with one tuft of wool left over his\r\neyes--those \"good old days\" are gone forever.  It is some time now\r\nsince he became convinced that if a lion and a lamb ever did lie down\r\ntogether the lamb would not get a wink of sleep.  As a matter of\r\nsurvival he has been making use of the interval to become a lion\r\nhimself and the process has been productive of a great roaring in the\r\nJungle.\r\n\r\nAll this co-operative purchasing of commodities in the three Prairie\r\nProvinces has not been developed to its present great volume without\r\narousing antagonism in the business world.  The co-operative idea in\r\nmerchandizing is not confined to the West by any means.  From the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific various organizations have been formed to carry\r\non business along co-operative lines.  A Co-Operative Union has been\r\nformed to propagate the movement and the subject is vast.\r\n\r\nBut the establishment of an extending network of elevators under the\r\ncontrol of the Western farmers has brought about possibilities which\r\nthreaten to revolutionize the whole established commercial system.\r\nFarmers' Elevators in Dakota, Minnesota and Alberta have proved that it\r\nis practical to utilize the same staff at each point to manage the\r\ndistribution of farm supplies as well as looking after elevator\r\noperation during the grain season.  This being so, it is not difficult\r\nto visualize a great distributing system under centralized management\r\nwith tremendous purchasing power.\r\n\r\nThere are those whose imaginations stretch readily to the extreme view\r\nthat the Grain Growers are a menace.  Such are filled with foreboding.\r\nThey see the country merchant out of business and the whole business\r\nfabric destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"The farmers are talking everlastingly about 'a square deal,'\" it is\r\nargued.  \"Why don't they practice what they preach and give the country\r\nmerchant a square deal?  What about the times of poor crops and money\r\nscarcity?  Where would the farmer have been if the country merchant had\r\nnot carried him on the books for the necessities of life?\"\r\n\r\n\"It didn't cost the merchant anything to carry me,\" denies the farmer.\r\n\"He just raised his prices to me and got credit from the wholesaler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what about the wholesaler?\"\r\n\r\n\"Raised his prices and got credit from the manufacturer and the bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the banks----\"\r\n\r\n\"Refused to give me the credit in the first place!\" interrupts the\r\nfarmer resentfully.  \"Do you dare to blame me, Mister, for cutting out\r\nall these unnecessary middle charges when by proper organization I am\r\nable to finance myself and take advantage of cash discounts on the cost\r\nof living?\"\r\n\r\nThat is the Farmer's motive for taking action.  He wants to improve his\r\nscale of living for the sake of his family.  By making the farm home a\r\nplace of comfort his sons and daughters will be more content to remain\r\non the land.  He does not seek to hoard money; he intends to spend it.\r\nIf middlemen are crowded out of his community it will be because there\r\nare too many of them.  Instead of having to support parasites the\r\ncommunity will be just that much more prosperous, the farms just that\r\nmuch better equipped, the land just that much more productive and\r\nthereby the country's wealth just that much greater.\r\n\r\nThat is how it appears to the Farmer.\r\n\r\n\"If the Farmer is to be a merchant, a wholesaler, a banker and all the\r\nrest of it he is no longer a farmer.  Is nobody else to have a right to\r\nlive?\" enquires the Cynic.  \"Did these Grain Growers fight the elevator\r\ncombine of the early days in order that they could establish a Farmers'\r\nCombine?  Is one any better than the other?\"\r\n\r\nThe inference is that the Grain Growers are bluffing deliberately and\r\naiming at all the abuses conjured by the word, \"combine.\"  The slander\r\nis self-evident to anyone who examines the constitution of the Farmers'\r\nMovement, so framed from the first that any possibility of clique\r\ncontrol was removed for all time.  It is impossible to have a \"combine\"\r\nof fifty thousand units and maintain the necessary appeal to the\r\ncupidity of the individual.  It is not possible for designing leaders,\r\nif such there were, to take even the first step in manipulation without\r\ndiscovery.  It simply cannot be done.  Woe betide the man who even\r\nexhibited such tendencies among his fellow Grain Growers!  These\r\norganized farmers have learned how to do their own thinking and every\r\nrugged ounce of them is assertive.  They are not to be fooled easily\r\nnor stampeded from their objective.  And what is that objective?\r\n\r\n\"To play politics!\" explodes the hidebound Party Politician knowingly.\r\n\r\n\"To get a share in the Divvy and eventually hog it!\" suggests the\r\nFinancial Adventurer.\r\n\r\n\"Equal opportunities to all; special privileges to none,\" the Grain\r\nGrower patiently reiterates.\r\n\r\nHe believes in doing away with \"the Divvy\" altogether.  He believes\r\nthat \"the spoils system\" is bad government and that no stone should be\r\nleft unturned to elevate the living conditions of the Average Citizen\r\nto the highest possible plane.  He believes that the status of a nation\r\ndepends upon the status of its Average Citizen and in that he does not\r\nconsider himself to be preaching Socialism but Common Sense.\r\n\r\nCome back to the country store--to the Country Retailer who is pulling\r\non the other end of the whiffle-tree with the Farmer for community\r\nprogress.  Each is necessary to the other and it is a vital matter if\r\nthe co-operation of the Farmer is going to kill off a teammate,\r\nespecially when tandeming right behind them are the Clydesdales of\r\nCommerce, the Wholesaler and the Manufacturer.  With the Farmer kicking\r\nover the traces, the Retailer biting and squealing at the Wholesaler\r\nevery little while and the Manufacturer with his ears laid back flat\r\nthis distribution of merchandize in Western Canada is no easy problem.\r\nIt is bringing the Bankers to their aristocratic portals all along the\r\nroute and about the only onlooker who is calm and serene is the\r\nMail-Order Man as he passes overhead post-haste in the Government\r\nflying machine.\r\n\r\n\"I'd get along alright if the Farmer would pay up his debts to me,\"\r\ncries the Retailer.  \"I've been giving him too long a line of credit\r\nand now he's running rings around me and tying me up in a knot.  When\r\nhe gets some money he goes and buys from my competitors for cash or he\r\nbuys more land and machinery.  If I shorten the rope he busts it and\r\nruns away!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd be alright if everybody else would mind their own business,\"\r\ngrumbles the Wholesaler.  \"Just trot along there now!  Pay your bills,\r\nFarmer.  Improve your service, Retailer.  Don't ask me about high or\r\nlow tariff.  I've got my hands full with established lines and it's my\r\nbusiness to supply them as cheaply as is consistent with quality.  I\r\nwant to see everybody succeed and it isn't fair to include me in any\r\nmix-up.  Only the humming of that confounded flying-machine up\r\nthere--Can't somebody bring down that Mail-Order bird?  He isn't paying\r\nhis share of the taxes while I've helped to finance this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves,\" sings the\r\nManufacturer.  \"Giddap, Dobbin!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Money makes the mare go,'\" quotes the Finance Minister, taking\r\nanother look out of the window at the War Cloud.  \"'Money comes from\r\nthe Soil,'\" and he push-buttons a buzz-bell over in the Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n\"Send out the choir and let's have that 'Patriotism and Production'\r\nsong again,\" is the order issued by some deputy sub-chief's assistant\r\nin response to the P. M.'s signal.  \"We must encourage our farmers to\r\neven nobler efforts.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all the while the Unearned Increment loafs around, studying the\r\nInterest Charges which are ticking away like a taxicab meter, and the\r\n\"Common Pee-pul\" gaze in frozen fascination at the High Cost of Living\r\nflying its kite and climbing the string!\r\n\r\nSeriously, though, the situation demands the earnest thought of all\r\nclasses.  The argument has so many facets that it is impossible within\r\nthe limits of a few pages to present an adequate conception of all the\r\nvital problems that surround the Farmers' Movement.  Each interest has\r\nits own data--packages of it--and it is difficult to know what to\r\nselect and what to leave out and at the same time remain entirely fair\r\nto all concerned.  There is some truth in many of the accusations which\r\nare bandied about.  No new country can do without credit facilities.\r\nWhat about the homesteader or the poorer farmer who is starting on\r\nmeagre resources?  They will win through if given a chance.  Who is to\r\ngive it to them if business is put on a cash basis?  On the other hand,\r\nis the man who has the cash to receive no consideration?\r\n\r\nThe trouble with our banks is that their system falls down when the\r\nretailer or the farmer need them most--in times of stringency.  It is\r\ntrue that the wholesaler has done much for the country, that the\r\nretailer is often at the mercy of careless or selfish customers who\r\nabuse credit privileges.  It is true that the mail-order houses also\r\nhave performed good services in the general task of making a new\r\ncountry.  The solution can be arrived at only by co-operation in its\r\ntrue sense--getting together--everybody.  Also, while one may joke\r\nabout \"Patriotism and Production,\" the fact remains that much has been\r\naccomplished by these campaigns.\r\n\r\nAsked if the organization of the farmers meant that the retailer would\r\nbe forced out of business, the well posted Credit Manager of a large\r\nWinnipeg wholesale establishment admitted that it would not mean that\r\nnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe same question put to C. Rice-Jones, President and Manager of the\r\nAlberta Farmers' Co-Operative Elevator Company, brought the same denial.\r\n\r\n\"The only men who would be weeded out,\" said he, \"are those who have\r\ngone into the local store business without knowing anything about it\r\nand who can remain in it only because the present system allows them to\r\ncharge any price they like.  The men who know their business will\r\nremain.  Those who are objecting to us are objecting to the very thing\r\nthey have been doing themselves for fifty years--organizing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We want to farm, not to go into business,\" remarked H. W. Wood,\r\nPresident of the United Farmers of Alberta.  \"The local merchant gives\r\nus a local distribution service, a service which has to be given.  We\r\ncannot destroy one single legitimate interest.  But if there are four\r\nor five men living by giving a service that one man should give in a\r\ncommunity and get just a living--that is what we are going to correct\r\nand we are absolutely entitled to do so.  The selfishness we are\r\naccused of the accusers have practiced right along and these very\r\nthings make it necessary for us to organize for self-protection.  If\r\nthey will co-operate with us to put their business on a legitimate\r\nbasis we are willing to quit trying to do this business ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThat is straight talk, surely.  It is a challenge to the business men\r\nto meet the farmers half way for a better understanding.  No problem\r\never was solved by extremists on either side.  Enmity and suspicion\r\nmust be submerged by sane discussion and mutual concessions bring about\r\nthe beginnings of closer unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE WIDTH OF THE FIELD\r\n\r\n  Our times are in His hand\r\n  Who saith, \"A whole I planned,\r\n  Youth shows but half; trust\r\n  God; see all, nor be afraid.\"\r\n            --_Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grain Growers' Movement in Western Canada now had attained\r\npotential proportions.  In Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta the\r\nProvincial Associations with their many Locals were in a flourishing\r\ncondition.  Each province was headquarters for a powerful farmers'\r\ntrading organization to market grain and provide co-operative supplies.\r\nUnlike the Saskatchewan Co-Operative Elevator Company and the Alberta\r\nFarmers' Co-Operative Elevator Company, however, the pioneer business\r\norganization of the Grain Growers--the Grain Growers' Grain\r\nCompany--was not provincial in scope but had a large number of\r\nshareholders in each of the three Prairie Provinces, in British\r\nColumbia and Ontario.  Altogether, in 1916 the farmers owned and\r\noperated over 500 country elevators as well as terminal elevators to a\r\ncapacity of three million bushels.  The farmer shareholders in the\r\nthree business concerns numbered more than 45,000.  During 1916 the\r\nfarmers handled over ninety million bushels of their own grain.\r\n\r\nWith this remarkable growth the danger of rivalries and jealousies\r\ndeveloping between their business organizations was a possibility upon\r\nwhich the farmers were keeping an eye.  A certain amount of friendly\r\ncompetition was unavoidable.  For some time, therefore, the necessity\r\nof closer union of their various organizations had been a serious topic\r\namong the leaders of the Grain Growers in all three provinces.  It was\r\nthe logical preparation for future achievements.\r\n\r\nAt its regular meetings in 1915 the Canadian Council of\r\nAgriculture--comprising officials representing the whole Grain Growers'\r\nMovement--had agreed that definite action would be desirable.  A\r\nmeeting of representatives from the respective Associations and\r\ncompanies interested accordingly was held in the offices of the\r\nSaskatchewan Co-Operative Elevator Company at Regina.  The plan\r\ndiscussed was the formation of one large business concern, similar in a\r\ngeneral way to the Wholesale Co-Operative Societies in the Old Country.\r\n\r\nThe idea was that this wholesale company should market and export\r\ngrain, control terminal elevators and any manufacturing that might be\r\ndone later on as well as importing supplies when necessary.  This would\r\nleave each provincial company with its own organization to look after\r\ncollection and distribution of supplies and to operate along the lines\r\nalready existing in Saskatchewan and Alberta.  The provincial companies\r\nwould be in absolute control of the central or wholesale company.\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion arose in regard to the method of selling grain.\r\nThe representatives from the United Farmers of Alberta, the Alberta\r\nFarmers' Co-Operative Elevator Company, the Manitoba Grain Growers'\r\nAssociation and the Grain Growers' Grain Company were unanimous in\r\nagreeing that it would be unwise to divide the marketing strength of\r\nthe farmers into three parts instead of concentrating for fullest\r\nbuying and selling power in the interest of the farmers in all three\r\nprovinces.  With the individual organizations each having a voice in\r\nthe control of the central company there did not seem to them to be\r\njustification for carrying provincial divisions into the marketing\r\nmachinery, thereby weakening it.  With this view the Saskatchewan\r\nrepresentatives could not agree, holding out for a separate selling\r\nchannel for Saskatchewan grain.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed to try to work out some other solution to the\r\nproblem of federating all three farmers' companies and a new proposal\r\nwas submitted at a meeting of the Canadian Council of Agriculture, held\r\nin Winnipeg in July, 1916.  This second attempt to get together was\r\nalong the line of joint ownership of subsidiary concerns which would\r\nlook after certain phases of the work--an export company, a terminal\r\nelevator company, the Public Press, Limited, and so on.  However, the\r\nplan did not work out satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the Alberta officials after the Regina meeting was that\r\neven if Saskatchewan were not ready at the present time to consider\r\nfederation on a basis acceptable to the other provinces, this should\r\nnot overthrow all idea of federation.  In short, the Alberta directors\r\nwere strongly of the opinion that, failing complete affiliation of the\r\nfarmers' business organizations at this time, the organization in\r\nAlberta and the Grain Growers' Grain Company should get together\r\nnevertheless, and this suggestion they presented at the meeting of the\r\nCanadian Council of Agriculture in Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nAs this was approved by the Grain Growers' Grain Company and the\r\nManitoba Association officials steps were taken to go into the matter\r\nin detail, the Saskatchewan organization having signified its intention\r\nof withdrawing from present action.  President C. Rice-Jones, of the\r\nAlberta Farmers' Co-Operative Elevator Company, and President T. A.\r\nCrerar, of the Grain Growers' Grain Company, were asked to give the\r\nmatter careful thought and make their recommendations to their\r\nrespective boards of directors.\r\n\r\nThere followed a joint meeting of all those interested.  It was held at\r\nWinnipeg and the result was a recommendation that the Alberta Farmers'\r\nCo-Operative Elevator Company and the Grain Growers' Grain Company be\r\namalgamated under the name \"United Grain Growers, Limited.\" [1]  When\r\nthe matter finally came before the farmers concerned--at their annual\r\nmeetings in 1916--it was decided unanimously to go ahead with the\r\namalgamation of these two farmers' business organizations.\r\n\r\nAccordingly application was made for necessary changes in the charter\r\nof the Grain Growers' Grain Company and these changes were granted by\r\nAct of the Dominion Parliament in June, 1917.  The authorized capital\r\nstock of United Grain Growers is five million dollars.  Its annual\r\nmeetings are to be held in the different provinces alternately.  The\r\nshareholders are formed into local groups, each represented by\r\ndelegates at annual meetings, these delegates alone doing the voting.\r\nProxy voting is not allowed.  The charter is designed, in brief, to\r\nintroduce the system of internal government that has been in practice\r\nby the Alberta Farmers' Co-Operative Elevator Company and the\r\nSaskatchewan Co-Operative Elevator Company and has proved so\r\nsatisfactory in every way.\r\n\r\nThis \"merger\" is unique in that the objections to a monopoly cannot be\r\nurged against it.  There is no watered stock.  With proxy voting\r\neliminated no group of men can gain control of the company's affairs.\r\nStock holdings by individuals is limited to $2,000 on a capitalization\r\nof five million and no man can grow rich by speculation with assets.\r\nInstead of exploiting the public the aim is service--reduction of\r\nprices instead of inflation.\r\n\r\nUnited Grain Growers, Limited, have begun their first year's business\r\nas an amalgamated farmers' concern, all the final details having been\r\nsettled to the entire satisfaction of the farmers interested.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' executives did not decide\r\nto amalgamate their co-operative marketing machinery with that of the\r\nothers just now must not be misconstrued as a lack of harmony among the\r\nleaders of these powerful institutions.  For they are meeting\r\nconstantly in their inter-provincial relations, for mutual business\r\nadvantages and in the broader educational aspects of the entire\r\nMovement.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that with such complete and solid business resources\r\nestablished in the three Prairie Provinces the organized farmers have\r\nbeen in a position to widen their field of influence and to carry on\r\nmuch propaganda work.  The Movement has spread steadily until it\r\nembraces organization in other than prairie provinces.  There seems to\r\nbe a tendency among the entire agricultural population of Canada to\r\norganize and co-operate; so that it is not impossible for Canadian\r\nfarmers in time to have a unity of organization in every province of\r\nthe Dominion.\r\n\r\nIn Ontario for many years there have been various farmers clubs,\r\nassociations or granges.  Until 1914 these were merely disorganized\r\nunits.  At the annual meeting of the Dominion Grange, however--December\r\n17th and 18th, 1913--the advisability of consolidating for greater\r\nco-operation was discussed at some length.  Representatives from the\r\nWestern Grain Growers were present and told the story of what the\r\nWestern farmer had accomplished.  A committee[2] was appointed and,\r\nafter investigating rural conditions in Ontario, this committee called\r\na convention for March 19th and 20th, 1914, at Toronto.  Farmers and\r\nfruit growers turned out in strength, old-time organization was cast\r\naside and there came into being the \"United Farmers of Ontario,\" [2]\r\nand the \"United Farmers' Co-Operative Company, Limited,\" [3] with aims\r\nand organization similar to those of the Grain Growers.\r\n\r\nAlthough practically born during the war--although conditions have been\r\nfar from normal, the United Farmers of Ontario have progressed steadily\r\nand naturally, with the co-operative activities setting the pace and\r\nwith efficient service as the watchword.  By 1915 there were 126 local\r\nassociations with a total membership of 5,000.  In the face of bad\r\nclimatic conditions and war disturbances 1916 found the young\r\norganization being looked upon by the Ontario agriculturists with\r\ninterest instead of suspicion.  It continued to grow of its own accord.\r\nBy that is meant that no advertising or other energetic campaign was\r\nundertaken; yet the membership increased during the year to 8,000 with\r\n200 Locals organized throughout the province.  To-day there is a total\r\nmembership in excess of twenty thousand throughout the Province.  Local\r\nconventions, addressed by Western leaders and other qualified speakers,\r\nhave become a feature of the development.\r\n\r\nThe first month in business for the United Farmers' Co-Operative\r\nCompany was September, 1914, when $827 was taken in.  The next month\r\nthe sales increased to $6,250, and in November to $8,214.  The December\r\nsales jumped to $17,970.  The sales for 1915 approximated $226,000.  In\r\n1916 this amount was nearly doubled and during the first five months of\r\n1917 the business done reached a total of $513,000.  All this on\r\npaid-up capital of only $5,000.  The Ontario Company has secured a new\r\ncharter, increasing its authorized capital from $10,000 to $250,000.\r\n\r\nThis expansion has been very satisfactory in view of the special\r\nconditions which necessarily make the progress of the Movement in the\r\nEast slower than in the West.  Ontario crops varying widely in\r\ndifferent districts, the same unity of interest which has made possible\r\nthe large grain companies of the West does not obtain.  The Ontario\r\nfarmers have had to confine their efforts to commercial lines.\r\nCo-operative sale of livestock, cheese, etc., may develop in time.\r\nAlso the farm population in Ontario is in the minority and there are\r\nfew electoral divisions where the urban vote does not control,\r\nresulting in mixed issues unknown on the prairies.  Powerful influences\r\nhave been brought to bear to handicap the Farmers' Movement in Ontario;\r\nbut nevertheless it is spreading so rapidly that with the proper\r\neducational campaign great possibilities lie ahead of the Ontario\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nThe United Farmers of Ontario now have become affiliated with the\r\nCanadian Council of Agriculture,[4] the inter-provincial body of the\r\norganized farmers of Canada.  The farmers of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward\r\nIsland and Quebec are showing much interest and have sought to have the\r\nMovement extended.  Meetings have been held and no doubt in due course\r\nthe Eastern farmers will be prepared for unity of action in every\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nWhat about British Columbia?  On February 16th, 1917, the \"United\r\nFarmers of British Columbia\" was a development in the Pacific Coast\r\nProvince.  Prior to this there had been quite a number of individual\r\nfarmers' organizations scattered throughout the agricultural sections\r\nof British Columbia.  The initiative for closer unity was taken by the\r\nCowichan Creamery Association, which called a meeting of the farmers in\r\nthe Cowichan district to discuss the cost of production and serious\r\nlabor conditions which were threatening complete failure of agriculture\r\nin British Columbia.  At this meeting what was called temporarily the\r\n\"Vancouver Island Farmers' Union\" was formed with over one hundred\r\nmembers.  Representatives from other districts were on hand to assure\r\nthe expansion of the movement and a provisional organization\r\ncommittee[5] was appointed to carry on the missionary work.\r\n\r\nThis Provisional Committee--called into existence by a mass meeting of\r\nfarmers held at Duncan, B.C., on November 4th, 1916--at once prepared a\r\nstrong circular, setting forth the case of the farmers and the need for\r\norganization.  This was sent out to the secretaries of all Farmers'\r\nInstitutes and suggested that a special meeting of delegates should be\r\nheld at Victoria when the usual farmers' conventions were in session a\r\nfew months later.  Thus came about the final large organization meeting\r\nof February 16th, 1917, which resulted in the \"United Farmers of\r\nBritish Columbia,\" with strong membership under the guidance of\r\nenthusiastic officers.[6]\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the Grain Growers, from Alberta and Manitoba, were\r\npresent to lend the encouragement of their experience.  Among them was\r\nRoderick McKenzie, then Secretary[7] of the Canadian Council of\r\nAgriculture.  When the farmers commenced organization in Manitoba, he\r\nsaid, it was possible to find many old-fashioned farmers who could see\r\nno reason for organization.  Had not their fathers been successful\r\nfarmers?  Had they not raised a family of eight or ten or a dozen or\r\nmore without belonging to any organization?--educated them, too?  These\r\nold-time farmers forgot that the world was making progress as the years\r\nwent by and they were not living in the same age as their fathers\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty years ago, when I was a boy,\" Mr. McKenzie continued, \"there was\r\nno such thing as a joint stock company.  We would not hear a word about\r\ncombines or trusts or transportation organizations or financial\r\ninstitutions.  At that time the business was carried on by individuals.\r\nThen it grew into partnerships.  From partnerships it developed into\r\njoint stock corporations and now we have these forming into trusts and\r\ncombines and holding companies.  It is simply co-operation of the few\r\nin the interests of the few.  It created a force in public affairs and\r\nthis must be met by another force--the organization of the common\r\npeople, led by the farmers.\r\n\r\n\"Where would the British Army be as a disorganized army confronting the\r\nGermans?  Nowhere!  Place a body of disorganized farmers in front of\r\norganized industrial interests and you see where you are at!  There is\r\nno form of industry, no form of labor, no form of finance, banking\r\nassociations, loan associations, insurance compensation associations,\r\ntransportation associations, that are not organized.  In Winnipeg we\r\nhave a Bootblack's Association and each of the little fellows\r\ncontributes five dollars a year to the support of their organization\r\nand five dollars represents fifty pairs of boots to blacken at a dime\r\nthe pair.\r\n\r\n\"In our Grain Growers' associations the organization is simple and\r\ncoherent.  There is no pass-word.  There is no grip.  There is no\r\nriding of the goat.  We don't ask a farmer whether he is a Grit or a\r\nTory; we don't ask him anything about his nationality or his relations\r\nor where he comes from or anything else.  One of the main aims of the\r\norganization is to make good Canadians of the different nationalities\r\nwe have in this Western country.  We are getting the Galicians and\r\nother nationalities gradually brought in--getting them together for the\r\ndevelopment of Canadianism and the community spirit.\r\n\r\n\"The one thing we have steered clear of is letting party politics enter\r\ninto our organization.  The thing we are trying to do is to co-operate\r\nwith our legislators by helping them to find out the things that need\r\nenacting into law and that have not been enacted into law or to find\r\nwhat laws already on the statute books are weak and ask that these\r\nweaknesses be corrected--not in a dominating spirit but in a spirit of\r\nequity.\"\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is rallying to the leadership of the farmers.  Their\r\npolicy is progressive.  Probably the first body in Canada to give Woman\r\nher proper place in its activities and councils was the Saskatchewan\r\nGrain Growers' Association.  To-day the farm women of the West are\r\norganized with the Grain Growers in all three Prairie Provinces,\r\nworking side by side.  Their aims are to solve the many problems\r\ndirectly bearing upon home life, educational facilities, health and all\r\nthings which affect the farm woman's life and they have been of great\r\nassistance in many ways, particularly in Red Cross and other patriotic\r\nendeavors.  To do justice to the noble efforts of Western Canada's farm\r\nwomen would require a separate volume.\r\n\r\nStill another development with far-reaching possibilities is the\r\ntendency of the Grain Growers and the Church to get together.  It first\r\nrevealed itself in Alberta under the conscientious encouragement of\r\nPresident H. W. Wood, of the United Farmers of Alberta, when in 1916 he\r\ninaugurated \"U.F.A. Sunday\"--one Sunday in each year to be set aside as\r\nthe Farmers' own particular day, with special sermons and services.  It\r\nwas born of a realization that something is fundamentally wrong with\r\nour social institutions and that \"the Church will have to take broader\r\nresponsibilities than it is now doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Christ to develop the individuals and Carl Marx mobilize and lead\r\nthem?\" asked Mr. Wood.  \"Is Christ to hew the stones and Henry George\r\nbuild them into the finished edifice?  If Christ cannot mobilize His\r\nforces and build true civilization His name will be forgotten in the\r\nearth.  The solution of the economic problems must be spiritual rather\r\nthan intellectual.  This is the work of the Church and the Church must\r\ntake the responsibility for it.\"\r\n\r\nNot only did the idea of a special Sunday meet with hearty response\r\nfrom the churches and farmers in Alberta, but it was taken up in\r\nManitoba and Saskatchewan.  In 1917 \"Grain Growers' Sunday\" was\r\nobserved all over the West and led to many inspiring addresses.  One of\r\nthe most significant of these was delivered by President J. A. Maharg,\r\nof the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association, at a mass meeting in\r\nMoose Jaw on Sunday, May 27th.\r\n\r\n\"There has been a strong agitation against church union,\" said Mr.\r\nMaharg.  \"We hope to bring the churches together.  The establishment of\r\ncommunity churches is not altogether an impossibility.  That groups of\r\nchurches will be brought together for the holding of community services\r\nis not altogether impossible, and a farmers' organization is not an\r\norganization that is farthest away from doing this.\"\r\n\r\nIn these days of revolutionary thought who shall set the length and\r\nwidth of the Farmers' field of influence, therefore?  A string of\r\nco-related provincial organizations of farmers, stretching right across\r\nthe Dominion, working harmoniously through the Canadian Council of\r\nAgriculture, will create a national force which in itself will\r\nrepresent Public Opinion--which cannot be denied the upward trend to\r\nwider and better citizenship for all classes in Canada.\r\n\r\nFor Public Opinion governs legislation as legislation governs the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix--Par. 17.\r\n\r\n[2] See Appendix--Par. 14.\r\n\r\n[3] See Appendix--Par. 15.\r\n\r\n[4] See Appendix--Par. 11.\r\n\r\n[5] See Appendix--Par. 16.\r\n\r\n[6] See Appendix--Par. 16.\r\n\r\n[7] See Appendix--Par. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE DEPTH OF THE FURROWS\r\n\r\n  Men at some time are masters of their fates:\r\n  The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\r\n  But in ourselves, that we are underlings.\r\n            --_Julius Caesar._\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause it was the logical and primary source of redress for the abuses\r\nwhich led the Western farmers to organize, the Grain Growers from the\r\nfirst have concerned themselves seriously with legislation.  It took\r\nthem a little while to discover that instead of being an all-sufficient\r\npanacea, mere legislation may become at times as flat and useless as a\r\ncold pancake.  But by the time the farmers had come to close quarters\r\nwith their difficulties their vision had widened so that they were able\r\nto look ahead, clearing the path for the next step forward.  So\r\nfrequently have they besought the Governments, both Federal and\r\nProvincial, that occasionally they have been accused by harassed\r\npoliticians of \"playing politics and nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nAs their organizations grew and acquired knowledge it is true that\r\nthese \"petitioners\" who \"did humbly pray\" began to straighten their\r\nbacks a little, the while they wrestled with the kinks that were\r\nbothering them from too much stooping.  It was a sort of chiropractic\r\nprocess for the alleviation of growing pains--the discovery of the\r\nproper nerve to ask and receive, to seek and find.  As the People grew\r\nmore accustomed to the sound of their own Voice it was only natural\r\nthat the quaver of timidity began to disappear from the tones of it and\r\nthat their speech grew stronger in the Legislative Halls dedicated to\r\ngovernment \"of, by and for\" them.  The \"Backbone of His Country\" set\r\nout to prove that he was not spineless, merely disjointed.  And as he\r\ngained confidence in his vertebrae the Farmer began to sit up and take\r\nnotice--began even to entertain the bold idea of getting eventually\r\nupon his feet.\r\n\r\nThe intention was laudable.  To make it audible he assembled a\r\nplatform, stood up on it, and argued.  His protests could be heard\r\nclean to the back of the Hall.  Like the young elephant whose trunk was\r\nbeing stretched by the crocodile, he said: \"You are hurting me!\"  In\r\nthe nose-pulling game of Party Politics as it too often has been\r\nplayed, it sometimes takes a lusty holler to make itself heard above\r\nall the other hollering that is going on; if getting a hearing is\r\n\"playing politics,\" then the Grain Growers have run up a pretty good\r\nscore.\r\n\r\nThey began with various amendments to the Grain Act.  These included\r\nthe famous \"car distribution\" clause, the farmer's right to a car and\r\nhis procedure to obtain it and additional cars as he needed them, the\r\nprovision of penalties for the purchase or sale of car rights, etc.\r\nOpposition to some of these amendments was keen and the farmers had to\r\nfight constantly; when they were not fighting for necessary amendments\r\nthey were fighting to retain those already secured.  Constant vigilance\r\nwas required.  Many delegations of Grain Growers visited Ottawa from\r\ntime to time to plead for improvement of conditions in handling grain,\r\nmore equitable inspection methods, government ownership and operation\r\nof terminal facilities and so on.\r\n\r\nEach year the annual conventions of the various associations in\r\nSaskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta grew in size and importance; each\r\nyear the Grain Growers' knowledge expanded, much of it gained by\r\nmarketing experience.  From these \"Farmers' Parliaments\" and the pages\r\nof the _Grain Growers' Guide_ they drew inspiration for many radical\r\nideas and threshed them out into well defined policies.  By the time\r\nSir Wilfrid Laurier, then Premier of Canada, ventured West in 1910 the\r\nfarmers were pretty well posted on national topics.  Everywhere he went\r\nhe faced thousands of ruddy, big-fisted men who read addresses to him\r\nand did a lot of extemporaneous talking which was no less forceful and\r\ncomplete than the prepared briefs.\r\n\r\nSix or eight hundred of them followed him back to Ottawa in December of\r\nthat same year and laid siege to the Government on its own\r\nstamping-ground.  It was the most remarkable red-seal record of the\r\nVoice from the Soil that hitherto had been known thereabouts.  In order\r\nthat there might be no doubt as to the planks on which they stood, the\r\nGrain Growers assembled a platform in full view of the audience.\r\n\r\n\"We want reciprocal Free Trade between Canada and the United States in\r\nall horticultural, agricultural and animal products,\" declared the\r\nfarmers; \"also in spraying materials and fertilizers; illuminating,\r\nfuel and lubricating oils; cement, fish and lumber.\r\n\r\n\"We want reciprocal Free Trade between the two countries in all\r\nagricultural implements, machinery, vehicles and parts of each of\r\nthese.  We want it carried into effect through the independent action\r\nof the respective Governments rather than by the hard and fast\r\nrequirements of a treaty.\r\n\r\n\"We want the duties on all British goods lowered to one-half the rates\r\ncharged under the general tariff schedule, whatever that may be.  Also,\r\nwe want any trade advantages given to the United States in reciprocal\r\ntrade relations to be extended to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"We want such further gradual reduction of the remaining preferential\r\ntariff as will ensure the establishment of complete free trade between\r\nCanada and the Mother Land within ten years.  We're willing to face\r\ndirect taxation, in such form as may be advisable, to make up the\r\nrevenue required under new tariff conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"This bunch wants the whole earth!\" cried the Canadian Manufacturers\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Sub-soil and all!\" nodded the Railways.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly they're plowing deep,\" commented the Banks.\r\n\r\n\"To eradicate weeds,\" admitted the Farmers.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it all, anyway!\" worried the Politicians.\r\n\r\nTo show that they were talking neither Tory nor Grit, the Western\r\nfarmers proceeded to waylay the Leader of the Opposition, Hon. R. L.\r\nBorden, the following year when he in turn decided to \"Go West.\"  He,\r\ntoo, came face to face with thousands of ruddy, big-fisted men and\r\nlistened to their equally plain-spoken addresses, prepared and\r\nextemporaneous.\r\n\r\nAnd what came of it all?  Did these farmers get what they wanted?\r\n\r\nNot yet!\r\n\r\nBut while all this agitation of the Grain Growers one time and another\r\nseldom has resulted in assent to their full requests, certain\r\ncompliances have been made on different occasions with beneficial\r\nresults.  For instance--to mention three--the Royal Grain Commission of\r\n1906, the permanent Grain Commission, and the Government Terminal\r\nElevators are an outcome of various requests and delegations of the\r\nGrain Growers.\r\n\r\nCertainly the organized farmers of Western Canada have attained a\r\nmeasure of self-confidence which enables them to declare themselves in\r\ndefinite language.  While seeking wider markets and the real value of\r\ntheir products, they have been opposed always to any scheme which\r\naccomplishes higher prices at the expense of the consumer or of the\r\nBritish workman.  They do not believe in import duties on food stuffs,\r\nclothing, fuel or building material.  Rather do they favor bringing\r\ncloser together the producer and consumer to the advantage of both.\r\nThey believe in cheaper money for the development of agriculture and\r\nother industries and in such utilization of natural resources that the\r\nhomes of the people may be improved.\r\n\r\nThey have stood consistently behind woman suffrage and the abolition of\r\nthe liquor traffic.  They would adopt direct legislation through the\r\nInitiative and Referendum.  They believe in the principles of\r\nCo-Operation in buying and selling.  They have urged extension of the\r\nparcel post system, the reduction of traffic charges to a reasonable\r\nbasis, Government control of waterways and all natural resources that\r\nthey may be developed only in the public interest.\r\n\r\nDoes a creed like this spell class legislation?  Does it indicate that\r\nin his eagerness to improve the conditions surrounding his own life the\r\nGrain Grower is forgetting the general welfare of the Dominion of\r\nCanada?  Listen to the doctrine which the leaders have inculcated on\r\nevery occasion--to President T. A. Crerar before the War:\r\n\r\n\"You have a very clear-cut and distinct responsibility in supporting\r\nthe whole movement of the organized farmers in Western Canada; for this\r\nmeans that you are improving not alone your own environment and\r\ncondition, but also creating the conditions and influences that will\r\ndevelop a higher and purer ideal of public service upon the part of our\r\npeople than we have in Canada to-day.  It should be a source of great\r\nsatisfaction that upon all important matters the policies adopted and\r\nsupported by the organized farmers in the past have been formed upon\r\nwhat in their judgment would benefit the country as a whole and not\r\nfrom the narrow view of selfish interest.\r\n\r\n\"During the past ten years the people of Canada have mortgaged the\r\nprosperity of the future to far too great an extent.  Our total\r\nborrowings as a nation, for public and private purposes, have run into\r\nsuch a colossal sum that it requires about $160,000,000 annually to pay\r\ninterest on the amounts borrowed.  This constitutes a very heavy task\r\non a country with about eight millions of a population.  Manufacturing\r\nindustries have been built up with a view of developing home industry\r\nand furnishing home markets, but often at a very heavy cost to our\r\nagricultural development, with the result that we have been travelling\r\nin a circle, reaching nowhere, rather than along the road that leads to\r\nProgress.\r\n\r\n\"We hear considerable nowadays of the necessity of a 'Back to the Land'\r\nmovement.  It is necessary, however, to do a little more than get\r\npeople located on the land with a view of increasing agricultural\r\nproduction.  It is necessary to free agriculture from the burdens now\r\nresting upon it and make it the first business of the country.\r\n\r\n\"Much of our natural resources has been recklessly handled, and as a\r\npeople we are faced with the necessity of overcoming the evil effects\r\nof our unbusinesslike methods as a nation in administering resources.\r\nIf we are to surmount our shortcomings in this respect and pay our\r\nobligations as a nation to the outside world, we must place agriculture\r\nthroughout Canada upon a thoroughly sound and profitable basis.  The\r\ncreation of wealth from our wonderfully rich natural resources, in\r\nwhich agriculture stands in the forefront, is the essential thing and\r\nshould receive most consideration from our Governments--both Dominion\r\nand Provincial.\r\n\r\n\"We must learn to respect each other's differences and, if we do, with\r\nthe development of that democratic spirit which is now day by day\r\nbecoming more manifest in Western Canada, we need have no fear of our\r\nusefulness as an agency in bringing about the ultimate triumph of the\r\nprinciples of justice between man and man.\"\r\n\r\nListen to President J. A. Maharg, addressing the Saskatchewan Grain\r\nGrowers' Association in 1914:\r\n\r\n\"What is wanted is the general recognition by all classes of the\r\nimportance of Agriculture and an honest desire by them to assist in\r\nplacing it on a basis equal to that of any other industry--making it an\r\noccupation that will draw people to it instead of driving them away.\r\nIn soliciting the aid of other classes I am not asking them to assist\r\nus in gaining any special favors whatever; all we ask is that they\r\nassist us to have Agriculture placed in the position its importance\r\nentitles it to.\"\r\n\r\nHear the President of the United Farmers of Alberta, H. W. Wood:\r\n\r\n\"This is the day of class co-operation.  That means inter-class\r\ncompetition.  In this competition of class against class ours is the\r\nlosing class at every turn because we have been the least organized,\r\nthe least co-operative; consequently the weakest.  Before we can hope\r\nto hold our own in this struggle we will have to bring our full\r\nstrength, thoroughly organized, to bear in protection of our rights.\r\n\r\n\"I have an abiding faith that the organized farmers will receive that\r\nstrength, not selfishly but unselfishly in the defence of the rights of\r\nall and for the spoliation of none.  The highest ambition I have for\r\nour organization is that it may develop along the lines of safety and\r\nsanity, that we may hold to a steady determination to go forward\r\nunwaveringly in our efforts till the door of hope and opportunity is as\r\nwide open to the farmers as to any class in the world, that we may\r\nzealously cultivate unselfish co-operation and learn to treat fairly\r\nand justly every man and every class that is giving a useful service to\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this from the Presidential address of R. C. Henders at the last\r\nManitoba Grain Growers' convention:\r\n\r\n\"In order to have legislation that will be equitable to the different\r\ninterests concerned, all of these interests should be somewhat equally\r\nrepresented in the passing of such legislation.  We do not desire to\r\nminimize in any way the great commercial interests of our people, yet\r\nwe feel that the work of our associations is educational and\r\nlegislative in its character.  Democratic rule requires that the\r\naverage citizen be an active, instructed and intelligent ruler of his\r\ncountry and therefore the success of democracy depends upon the\r\neducation of the people along two principal lines--first, political\r\nknowledge; second, and what is of far more importance, political\r\nmorality.  Ideal government is found when we have righteous rulers\r\ngoverning a people of character and intelligence.  Right education is\r\nright thinking and right thinking can only come through accurate\r\ninformation.\"\r\n\r\nNow, is all this preaching of the men who are leading the farmers just\r\nso much talk?--chaff?--prairie wind?\r\n\r\nIf not, what lies back of it?  The farmers have an organization which\r\nmeets every so-often to harmonize and crystallize the thought among\r\ntheir various associations and business units.  It is that same\r\nCanadian Council of Agriculture which has been mentioned already.  It\r\nconsists of the executive committees of eight farmers' co-operative,\r\nbusiness and educational institutions, to wit: The United Farmers of\r\nOntario, The United Farmers' Co-Operative Company of Ontario, The Grain\r\nGrowers' Association of Manitoba, United Grain Growers (of the entire\r\nWest), The Grain Growers' Association of Saskatchewan, The Saskatchewan\r\nCo-Operative Elevator Company, The United Farmers of Alberta, and the\r\n_Grain Growers' Guide_, the official organ of the whole movement.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of this influential body in Winnipeg in December,\r\n1916--representing an affiliation of 60,000 farmers--a \"National\r\nPolitical Platform\" was adopted to embrace economic, political and\r\nsocial reforms not alone in the interests of the farmers but of\r\nCanada's citizens generally.  The farmers are looking for the support\r\nof all who live in cities and towns as well as the rural districts; of\r\norganized Labor as well as organized farmers.\r\n\r\nThis platform was referred to the provincial organizations which stand\r\nbehind the Canadian Council of Agriculture.  It was considered by each\r\nof the provincial boards and by them referred in turn to the three\r\nthousand local community associations into which the members are\r\norganized.  Each Local was asked to call a meeting to consider the\r\nplatform and vote upon its adoption.  The next step was for the members\r\nto give their votes and financial support only to such candidates for\r\nthe House of Commons as would pledge support of this National Platform\r\nin its entirety and who could be relied upon as Members of Parliament\r\nto live up to their pledges.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the National Political Platform on which the farmers stand\r\nwithout equivocation:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUSTOMS TARIFF\r\n\r\nWHEREAS the war has revealed the amazing financial strength of Great\r\nBritain, which has enabled her to finance not only her own part in the\r\nstruggle, but also to assist in financing her Allies to the extent of\r\nhundreds of millions of pounds, this enviable position being due to the\r\nfree trade policy which has enabled her to draw her supplies freely\r\nfrom every quarter of the globe and consequently to undersell her\r\ncompetitors on the world's markets, and because this policy has not\r\nonly been profitable to Great Britain but has greatly strengthened the\r\nbonds of Empire by facilitating trade between the Motherland and her\r\noverseas Dominions--we believe that the best interests of the Empire\r\nand of Canada would be served by reciprocal action on the part of\r\nCanada through gradual reductions of the tariff on British imports,\r\nhaving for its object a closer union and a better understanding between\r\nCanada and the Motherland, and by so doing not only strengthen the\r\nhands of Great Britain in the life and death struggle in which she is\r\nnow engaged, but at the same time bring about a great reduction in the\r\ncost of living to our Canadian people;\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS the protective tariff has fostered combines, trusts and\r\n\"gentlemen's agreements\" in almost every line of Canadian industrial\r\nenterprise, by means of which the people of Canada--both urban and\r\nrural--have been shamefully exploited through the elimination of\r\ncompetition, the ruination of many of our smaller industries and the\r\nadvancement of prices on practically all manufactured goods to the full\r\nextent permitted by the tariff;\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS agriculture--the basic industry upon which the success of\r\nall other industries primarily depends--is almost stagnant throughout\r\nCanada as shown by the declining rural population in both Eastern and\r\nWestern Canada, due largely to the greatly increased cost of\r\nagricultural implements and machinery, clothing, boots and shoes,\r\nbuilding material and practically everything the farmer has to buy,\r\ncaused by the protective tariff, so that it is becoming impossible for\r\nfarmers generally to carry on farming operations profitably;\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS the protective tariff is the most wasteful and costly\r\nmethod ever designed for raising national revenue, because for every\r\ndollar obtained thereby for the public treasury at least three dollars\r\npass into the pockets of the protected interests, thereby building up a\r\nprivileged class at the expense of the masses, thus making the rich\r\nricher and the poor poorer;\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS the protective tariff has been and is a chief corrupting\r\ninfluence in our national life because the protected interests, in\r\norder to maintain their unjust privileges, have contributed lavishly to\r\npolitical and campaign funds, thus encouraging both political parties\r\nto look to them for support, thereby lowering the standard of public\r\nmorality;\r\n\r\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Canadian Council of Agriculture,\r\nrepresenting the organized farmers of Canada, urges that as a means of\r\nbringing about these much needed reforms and at the same time reducing\r\nthe high cost of living, now proving such a burden on the people of\r\nCanada, our tariff laws should be amended as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) By reducing the customs duty on goods imported from Great Britain\r\nto one half the rates charged under the general tariff and that further\r\ngradual, uniform reductions be made in the remaining tariff on British\r\nimports that will ensure complete free trade between Great Britain and\r\nCanada in five years.\r\n\r\n(2) That the Reciprocity Agreement of 1911, which still remains on the\r\nUnited States statute books, be accepted by the Parliament of Canada.\r\n\r\n(3) That all food stuffs not included in the Reciprocity Agreement be\r\nplaced on the free list.\r\n\r\n(4) That agricultural implements, farm machinery, vehicles, fertilizer,\r\ncoal, lumber, cement, illuminating fuel and lubricating oils be placed\r\non the free list.\r\n\r\n(5) That the customs tariff on all the necessaries of life be\r\nmaterially reduced.\r\n\r\n(6) That all tariff concessions granted to other countries be\r\nimmediately extended to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAXATION FOR REVENUE\r\n\r\nAs these tariff reductions will very considerably reduce the national\r\nrevenue derived from that source, the Canadian Council of Agriculture\r\nwould recommend that in order to provide the necessary additional\r\nrevenue for carrying on the government of the country and for the\r\nprosecution of the war to a successful conclusion, direct taxation be\r\nimposed in the following manner:\r\n\r\n(1) By a direct tax on unimproved land values, including all natural\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n(2) By a sharply graduated personal income tax.\r\n\r\n(3) By a heavy graduated inheritance tax on large estates.\r\n\r\n(4) By a graduated income tax on the profits of corporations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NECESSARY REFORMS\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Council of Agriculture desires to endorse also the\r\nfollowing policies as in the best interests of the people of Canada:\r\n\r\n(1) The nationalization of all railway, telegraph and express companies.\r\n\r\n(2) That no more natural resources be alienated from the Crown but\r\nbrought into use only under short term leases, in which the interests\r\nof the public shall be properly safeguarded, such leases to be granted\r\nonly by public auction.\r\n\r\n(3) Direct legislation, including the initiative and referendum and the\r\nright of recall.\r\n\r\n(4) Publicity of political campaign fund contributions and expenditures\r\nboth before and after elections.\r\n\r\n(5) The abolition of the patronage system.\r\n\r\n(6) Full provincial autonomy in liquor legislation, including\r\nmanufacture, export and import.\r\n\r\n(7) That the extension of the franchise to women in any province shall\r\nautomatically admit them to the federal franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the official stand of the farmers and they point out that their\r\npolitical platform[1] is constructive, not destructive.  The farmers\r\nare not trying to sidestep their fair share of the expenses in\r\nconnection with government and public institutions; where they have\r\ntorn down they have rebuilt.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that the prosperity of Western Canada is essential to our\r\nnational prosperity, it is not necessary to look far in order to\r\nunderstand why the farmers have taken this definite action.  Western\r\nfarmers and citizens generally are carrying extra burdens which offset\r\nthe advantages of cheap and fertile land.  Interest on mortgages and\r\nbank loans have been higher than in Eastern Canada.  It is more\r\nexpensive to distribute commodities West than East.  On account of the\r\nlavish donations of Western lands to railway promoters the cost of\r\nrailway construction has borne heavily on the West.  Freight rates are\r\nabout sixty per cent. higher and express rates about sixty-six per\r\ncent. higher than in Eastern Canada.  Thanks to the protective tariff,\r\nWestern people are paying high for everything they get without any\r\nreturn compensation.\r\n\r\n\"Something has to be done to lift some of these unjust burdens,\" say\r\nthe farmers, \"if a prosperous country is to be developed West of the\r\nGreat Lakes.\"\r\n\r\nHence this platform.  The Western farmers believe in it earnestly.  It\r\nis their politics.  They believe that the results which would follow\r\nits support in the House of Commons would be of untold benefit to the\r\nCanadian people as a whole.  They will continue to believe it.\r\n\r\nWhen the crisis arose which brought about the last election, in which\r\nUnion Government swept the West, the farmers saw the gravity of the\r\nsituation and were prepared to forego immediate discussion of tariff\r\namendments to concentrate on winning the war.  Some of the farmers'\r\ncandidates even withdrew in favor of Union candidates.  All those who\r\nremained in the field were elected.\r\n\r\nAfter the war is won--what?  Reforms of breathtaking sweep are taking\r\nplace as the natural outcome of current conditions.  The liquor traffic\r\nhas been tossed aside like a useless boot.  Woman has stepped forth to\r\na sphere of active worth without upheaval.  Just where lie the\r\nboundaries of the impossible and who shall define them?\r\n\r\nIt is a far-seeing, clear-thinking New Farmer who has come forward in\r\nthe last decade.  Through his associations, his marketing experiences,\r\nhis contact with railways and banks and manufacturers and governments\r\nhe has become a student of economics.  At the same time he has\r\nstrengthened his thews and sinews for whatever may face him on the path\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nAnd his eyes are wide open to the fact that there are \"lions in the\r\npath!\"\r\n\r\nWait a minute, Mr. Business Man!  Before condemning this Western farmer\r\nout of hand, put yourself in his place and try for a moment in all\r\nfairness to forget your own viewpoint.  It may be that you have not\r\neven seen the prairies.  Have you ever been at sea with not a thing in\r\nsight but water, sky, horizon?  Imagine the water to be land, and\r\nyourself living in a one-room shack or a little low sod hut bewhiskered\r\nwith growing grass.  The nearest railway was fifty miles away and you\r\ngot so lonesome that the howl of a coyote or the cry of owls in the\r\nnight nearly drove you crazy.  Neighbors so scarce your social\r\npleasures were cut off by distance and you reared your family on that\r\nhomestead twenty-five miles from a doctor, a church or a school.\r\n\r\nWhen you made the long trip in for supplies in those early days you\r\nfound you had to pay anywhere up to twice as much as their market value\r\nwhile for what you had to sell you had to take from twenty-five to\r\nfifty per cent. less than the market value.  The implements you simply\r\nhad to have for your work you bought on the instalment plan with\r\ninterest at ten and twelve per cent. for the privilege.\r\n\r\nWhen you had survived three years of this and with high hopes took your\r\npatent to the mortgage company to raise a loan at ten per cent. you\r\nfound you couldn't get accommodation.  Thereupon in marched your\r\nimplement and other creditors with a chattel mortgage on everything you\r\nhad--except the missus and the kids and the baby's bottley-by!\r\n\r\nThen in the beautiful hot month of August it blew up black one day and\r\nthe chickens scurried for shelter and you and the wife stood with your\r\nnoses flattened against the window-pane--unless it was only oiled\r\npaper--and watched the big ice-marbles bouncing and heard the hail\r\ndrumming flat in a few minutes the acres of wheat you had worked so\r\nhard to produce.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you escaped that time only to have your wheat frozen later\r\non and when you took three days on purpose to haul in a wagonload to\r\nthe elevator you couldn't get a decent offer for it.  So that you\r\npulled off your mitts and clenched your frost-cracked hands as you\r\nprepared to turn homeward with but a pitiful portion of the food and\r\nclothing you had promised the family you would bring.  As you spread\r\nacross your chest, inside your sheepskin coat, the old newspaper\r\nsomebody had given you would your soul expand with the joy of living\r\nwhile you headed out into the snowy waste at forty degrees below zero?\r\n\r\nAnd if after you got home and the crying young ones had been put to bed\r\nin the corner behind the canvas curtain and your wife came and sat\r\nbeside you, her own tears bravely dried--if then you read in the paper\r\nthat the Government had decided you farmers were so prosperous you\r\nshould contribute from your easily gained wealth a free gift to\r\nmanufacturers, financiers, railway magnates or others--then would you\r\nsay with a great booming, hearty enthusiasm and shining eyes: \"I tell\r\nyou, Wife, this is the life!\"--would you?\r\n\r\nOr would you just proceed to swear--naturally, successfully, in what is\r\nknown as \"flowing\" language?\r\n\r\nBy just such pioneer hardships were the farmers of Western Canada\r\ndriven to organize in self-defence.  It has ever been the history of\r\nrevolt that its wellspring was the suffering of the people.  Pioneer\r\nhardships it was that caused the various movements which agitated the\r\nfarmers of the Western States in earlier days.  When fingers become\r\nhardened and crooked from unceasing toil that achieves nothing but\r\npremature old age; when hope withers in a treadmill that grinds to the\r\nvery soul--then comes rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Since the formation of the organized farmers' National Political\r\nPlatform several of its planks have been adopted as legislation at\r\nOttawa, notably the abolition of the patronage system, extension of the\r\nfranchise to women, total prohibition, and personal income taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nAND THE END IS NOT YET.\r\n\r\nThe principle of co-operation draws the whole community together.  It\r\nbreaks down barriers.  It unites the State.  It gives hope to the\r\nhumblest toiler.  And it strengthens the great moral ideal of duty,\r\nwithout which no State can endure.--_Earl Grey_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is to be the final outcome of the Western farmers' revolt and its\r\nspread to rural communities in Eastern provinces?  Is there to be greater\r\nharmony among opposing interests or is Canada on the threshold of\r\ninternal strife which will plow deep furrows of dissension between class\r\nand class to an extent hitherto unknown in this country?  If there is to\r\nbe a pitched fight between capitalistic groups and the people at large,\r\nled by the farmers, what are the chances of victory for the latter?  If\r\nthey win, what will be the national effect?\r\n\r\nThese were a few of the questions which first turned the writer's serious\r\nattention to the Grain Growers.  It seems scarcely credible that this\r\ngreat economic movement has attained present momentum practically\r\nunheralded; yet such is the case.  The writer had watched its early\r\nstruggles to success from Government windows and as preparation for a\r\nbrief historical sketch it seemed desirable to get out among the farmers\r\nthemselves and study the situation from their angle.\r\n\r\nFrankly, the task was not approached without some skepticism as to the\r\nmotives which might be uncovered.  Almost the only occasions on which the\r\nGrain Growers revealed themselves to the public were when they waited\r\nupon politicians for this, that or the other.  So often did this happen\r\nand so insistent were they that there seemed some grounds for the belief\r\nthat to satisfy a Grain Grower was humanly impossible.  From Legislative\r\ncasements it even looked at times as if they were a new species of\r\nIndian, collecting political scalps!  All manner of people accused them\r\nof all manner of things.  In the East they were called \"blacksmith-shop\r\npoliticians, nail-keg economists, grousers and soreheads\"; in the West\r\nthey were dubbed \"corner-grocer statesmen and political football players.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the caravans of the Eastern political chieftains, Liberal and\r\nConservative, came West they knew they were going to be held up by the\r\noutlaws.  Long before these respective expeditions started across the\r\nplains infested with wild and dangerous Grain Growers, their scouts--the\r\nWestern M.P.'s--were ranging far and wide in preparation.\r\n\r\nAnd when those Grain Growers in turn rode East to take possession of\r\nOttawa there was a popular expectation that they were about to whoop in\r\nand shoot up the town in the real old wild and woolly way.  They were\r\nreferred to cleverly as \"Sod-Busters.\"  It was rather startling to find\r\nthem merely a new type of Business Farmer, trained to think on his feet,\r\na student of economics.\r\n\r\nTo gather and verify the facts here recorded has required two years.\r\nDuring that time the writer has listened to earnest farmers in prairie\r\nshacks, pioneers and newcomers, leaders and followers, and has watched\r\nthese farmers at work in their \"Farmers' Parliaments\" where they assemble\r\nannually by the thousands.  It is impossible thus to meet and know these\r\nmen while examining the facts of their accomplishments without being\r\nimpressed by the tremendous potentialities that underlie their efforts.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first discovery is that the organized farmers have ideals\r\nbeyond material advantage and that these ideals are national in scope,\r\ntherefore involving responsibilities.  Undeterred by these, the farmers\r\nare eager to push on to further achievements.  Their hope for these\r\nideals lies in the success of their business undertakings and it is\r\nbecause that success is the spinal column of the whole movement that it\r\noccupies such a prominent place in this historical outline.\r\n\r\nNot all the Grain Growers are men of vision, it must be admitted.  Many\r\nhave joined the movement for what they can get out of it.  In all great\r\naggregations of human beings it is quite possible to discover the full\r\ngamut of human failings.  But loose threads sticking to a piece of cloth\r\nare no part of its warp and woof.  It is the thinking Grain Grower who\r\nmust be reckoned with and he is in the majority; the others are being\r\neducated.\r\n\r\nIf there is doubt as to the sincerity of the organized farmers, why did\r\ntheir pioneer business agency spend its substance in educational\r\ndirections instead of solely along the straight commercial lines of the\r\nconcerns with which it was in competition?  The very mould into which it\r\npoured its energies shaped special difficulties, generated special\r\nantagonisms and every possible obstruction to its progress.  Its cash\r\ngrants to the Associations in the West, to the official organ of the\r\nmovement, even to the Ontario farmers, run over the\r\nhundred-thousand-dollar mark.\r\n\r\nOr, take the case of the Grain Growers at Virden, Manitoba, who proposed\r\nto bring into the district a large shipment of binder twine to supply\r\ntheir members.  When the local merchant who had been handling this\r\nnecessity learned of the plan he raised his voice, thus:\r\n\r\n\"If you fellows are going to do that then I go out of binder twine this\r\nseason.  I won't handle a pound of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even to supply the farmers who don't belong to our Association?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I said.  You're going to make a convenience of me when you\r\nrob me of all my cash business.  The only business I could do would be\r\nwith farmers who wanted credit.\"\r\n\r\nDid the Grain Growers say: \"That's their lookout, then.  Let them join us\r\nor go twineless\"?  No.  They decided to bring in their co-operative\r\nshipment as planned, but to allow the merchant to handle it on commission\r\nin order to prevent any injustice to the other farmers.\r\n\r\nIncidents like that can be recorded from all over the country.  It does\r\nnot take very many of them to compel the honest conviction that equity of\r\ncitizenship for all the people in every walk of life means more to these\r\nfarmers than a high-sounding shibboleth.  That being so, it becomes\r\ndifficult to accept the slur of utter selfishness--the idea that the\r\nfarmers are auto-intoxicated, a pig-headed lot who cause trouble for\r\nnothing.  It is very hard to believe that Everybody Else is good and kind\r\nand sincere and true, affectionate one to another with brotherly love,\r\nnot slothful in business; for one knows that the best of us need the\r\nprayers of our mothers!\r\n\r\nWhen these Grain Growers started out they did not know very much about\r\nwhat was going on.  They had their suspicions; but that was all.  To-day\r\nthey know.  Their business activities have taught them many things while\r\nproviding the resources for the fight that is shaping unless the whole\r\nmonopolistic system lets go its stranglehold.\r\n\r\nYes, the farmers do talk about freedom in buying and selling; also about\r\ntariff reform.  They point out that there are criminal laws to jail\r\nbankers who dared to charge from twenty-five per cent. to forty-two per\r\ncent. for the use of money; that food and clothing and the necessaries of\r\nlife are the same as money and that high tariff protection which fosters\r\ncombines and monopolies is official discrimination against the many in\r\nfavor of the few; that there are other and more just forms of taxation\r\nand that all old systems of patronage and campaign funds have got to go\r\nif the grave problems of these grave times are to be met successfully.\r\n\r\nIt is no old-time \"Hayseed\" who is discussing these things.  It is a New\r\nFarmer altogether.  The Farmers' Movement is no fancy of the moment\r\neither, but the product of Time itself.  It is a condition which has\r\ndeveloped in our rural life as the corolla of increased opportunities for\r\neducation.  The Farmer to-day is a different man to what he was ten years\r\nago--indeed, five years ago.\r\n\r\nIt has taken fifteen years of bitter struggle for the Western farmers to\r\nwin to their present position and now that they are far enough along\r\ntheir Trail to Better Things to command respect they are going to say\r\nwhat they think without fear or favor.  They believe the principles for\r\nwhich they stand to be fundamental to national progress.\r\n\r\nIf there is to be any attempt to cram the old order of things down the\r\npeople's throats; if, under cloak of all this present talk of winning the\r\nwar, of new eras and of patriotism, profiteers should scheme and plan\r\nfresh campaigns--then will there be such a wrathful rising of the people\r\nas will sweep everything before it.  In the forefront of that battle will\r\nstand the rugged legions of the organized farmers.\r\n\r\nMake no miscalculation of their ability to fight.  This year, 1918, will\r\nsee them sawing their own lumber in their own saw-mills in British\r\nColumbia.  If necessary, they can grind their own flour in their own\r\nflour mills, dig their own coal from their own mines, run their own\r\npacking-plants, provide their own fidelity and fire-insurance, finance\r\ntheir own undertakings.  They grow the grain.  They produce the new\r\nwealth from the soil.  They are the men who create our greatest asset,\r\neverything else revolving upon the axis of Agriculture in Canada.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the farming population has learned to co-operate and stand\r\nsolid; if in addition they have acquired the necessary capital to educate\r\nthe masses and are prepared to spend it in advancing their ideals; if the\r\nworking classes of the cities and the soldier citizens of Coming Days\r\njoin their ranks--what chance will Special Privilege have against the\r\npublic desire for Equal Rights?\r\n\r\nIs it to be co-operation in all sincerity or class warfare?  If the other\r\ngreat interests in our national life will meet the Farmer in a fair\r\nspirit, approaching our national problems in an honest attempt to\r\nco-operate in their solution for the common good, they will find the\r\nFarmer meeting them eagerly.  They will find that these farmer leaders\r\nare reasonable men, broad-minded, square-principled and just--no less so\r\nbecause the class they represent is organized to stand up for its rights.\r\n\r\nThe situation is not hopeless.  Most of these pages we have been turning\r\nare Back Pages.  Old conditions and much of the bitterness which they\r\ngenerated have passed.  The story of those old conditions has been told\r\nfrom the viewpoint of the Farmer in order that his attitude may be\r\nunderstood.  But it must be remembered that the grain trade to-day is a\r\nvery different proposition to what it was and that many of the men who\r\nhave devoted their lives to it in the cities have played a big and honest\r\npart in its development.  The Winnipeg Grain Exchange as an Exchange has\r\ndone a great deal for Western Canada, a point that undoubtedly has been\r\noverlooked by many farmers.  Gradually, however, the Farmer has learned\r\nthat all is not evil in \"Babylon\"; for out of revolution has come\r\nevolution.[1]\r\n\r\nThe key to that better future which is desired so earnestly and wisely is\r\nEducation.  The problems of the day are commanding the mental focus of\r\nthe nation.  The Banks, the Railways, the Manufacturers are considering\r\nthem.  The Joint Committee of Commerce and Agriculture has great\r\nopportunities for removing much old-time hostility on both sides.  And\r\nnow that true co-operation of all classes has become a national duty,\r\nsurely out of the testing must come better understanding and a greater\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nJust now, of course, there is only the War.  It has brought the Canadian\r\npeople to their feet.  For the angry glare of the gun flashes has thrown\r\nin silhouette many fallacies, many foibles and rubbish heaps, and these\r\nmust be swept out in preparation for the new nationhood which Canada is\r\ncalled upon to assume.  With a third of the entire British Empire\r\nentrusted to her management and the hopeful gaze of homemakers the world\r\nover turning upon her Canada's responsibilities are great.  But she will\r\nrise to her opportunities.\r\n\r\nJust now there is only the War.  The history of mankind has no previous\r\nrecord of such chaos, such a solemn time.  Thrones toppling, maps\r\nchanging, whole peoples dying of starvation and misery while the fate of\r\nDemocracy is balanced on the issue.  Men are slaying each other on land,\r\nin the air, on the water and below it while the forces of Destruction are\r\ngnawing holes in the World's resources with the rapacity of swarming\r\nrats.  It is costing Great Britain alone over thirty-five million dollars\r\nevery day--a million and a half every hour!\r\n\r\nAs for Canada--much figuring is being done by experts and others in\r\nattempts to estimate the total debt which the Canadian people will have\r\nto carry after the war.  But the people themselves are too far immersed\r\nin war efforts to pause for futile reckonings.  There will be time enough\r\nfor that when the war is won, and won it shall be, no matter what the\r\ncost.  It requires no great perspicacity to realize that our total\r\nnational debt will be a sum which rolls so easily on its ciphers that it\r\neludes the grasp of the average mind.  It is going to cost a lot even to\r\nkeep the wheels greased at five and one-half per cent. from year to year.\r\nEverybody knows it.  _Win the War!_\r\n\r\nWhen the lamp went out and the old world we had known blew up--away back\r\nin 1914--we spagged about anxiously, calling to each other: \"Business as\r\nUsual!\"  Since then factory production has gone up fifty per cent.;\r\nexport trade a hundred; profits on capital all the way up to the\r\nbillion-and-a-quarter mark.  We have got so used to things in four years\r\nthat there is danger of forgetting that War has driven a sap beneath\r\nthese ironical gifts of Mars and it is full time Business looked around\r\nfor a place to light and got ready to dig itself in.\r\n\r\nMobilization, co-operation of every interest, the full grapple of every\r\nindividual--national effort, in short--these the State demands.  The\r\ncoverlet has been thrown back upon the realization that the State has\r\nclaims upon each citizen which transcend his individual fortunes--that\r\nindividual prosperity, in fact, is entirely dependent upon the prosperity\r\nof the national whole.\r\n\r\nNot all by himself can the Man Behind The Gun win a war like this.  At\r\nhis heels must stand the munition workers, the Man Back of The Desk, the\r\npeople themselves, each guarding against waste and each contributing his\r\nor her part, great or small, for that national economy which alone can\r\nhope to sustain the terrific pace that victory demands.  Finally, out in\r\nthe great open spaces, faithful and unassuming and backing his country to\r\nthe limit, must plod the Man Behind The Plow, working silently and\r\nsteadily from dawn till dark to enlist and re-enlist the horizoned acres.\r\n\r\nCanada has reason for pride in her farmers.  No class is more loyal to\r\nBritish traditions.  No class is more determined to win this war.\r\nThousands of their sons are at the front.  Many a lonely mother has stood\r\non a prairie knoll, straining her eyes for the last glimpse of the buggy\r\nand bravely waving \"God-speed.\"  In many a windswept prairie farm home\r\nreigns the sad pride of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nOut of the sanctifying fires is arising a national tendency to new\r\nviewpoints.  The hope of Canada lies in a more active participation in\r\naffairs by the Average Citizen.  In opposition to an awakened national\r\ninterest what chance is there going to be for the silent partnerships of\r\n\"invisible government\"?  'Twill be a sorry partizan who allows his\r\nthoughts at this crisis to patter away at that old practice line, so full\r\nof past mistakes: \"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of\r\nthe Party.\"\r\n\r\nWin-the-War unity is the leaven at work in Canada to-day and regeneration\r\nis coming.\r\n\r\nWhat does it matter except that our country's leaders shall rise to their\r\nopportunities for true statesmanship with a deep sense of their\r\nresponsibilities to the millions who turn to them for guidance in this\r\ntime of national stress?  What does it matter except that the people\r\nshall grant to their leaders their sympathy and co-operation in the cares\r\nof crisis?\r\n\r\nAs this book goes to the publisher Union Government in Canada has become\r\na fact.  Not since Confederation has such a thing happened in this\r\ncountry.  The vampire methods with which our political system has been\r\ncursed have been thrown under foot and thinking Canadians everywhere have\r\ndrawn a breath of relief.  The energies which have been wasted in\r\njockeying for party position are now concentrating upon effective unity\r\nof action.  Let us hope so indeed.  There must be no want of confidence\r\nin the cheers which echo from Canadian trenches.\r\n\r\nFor over there where Canada's first line of defence runs from the North\r\nSea through Belgium into France your boy, Mr. Business Man, and your boy,\r\nMr. Farmer, stand shoulder to shoulder.  Think you that in the crucible\r\nwhich bares the very souls of men those boys have any thought of class\r\ncriticism or of selfish grabbings?  In those trenches you will find more\r\npractical Christianity, more unselfishness, more true brotherhood than\r\ncan be realized at this distance.  The spirit of sacrifice, the\r\nhelp-one-another idea, the equal share and charity of thought--these\r\nrevitalizing principles will be brought back by our khaki citizens when\r\nthey march home from victory.  It is past belief that there should be\r\nanything but complete unity of purpose as they look back for their\r\ncountry's supports.\r\n\r\nA coat of arms on the red field of a British flag, a maple leaf on khaki\r\ncap or collar-band, a single name on every shoulder-strap--CANADA.  All\r\nthe nations of the earth salute that name.  For it is emblazoned on the\r\nshell-churned fields of Ypres where, sweltering and bleeding, Canada\r\n\"saved the day\" for all humanity.  It is inscribed for all time to come\r\non the Somme--on Vimy Ridge--on the difficult slopes of Passchendaele.\r\n\r\nJust now, only the War.\r\n\r\nBut when in the Years To Be we find ourselves in some far land or in some\r\ninternational circle which Chance, mayhap, has thrown together; when the\r\ntalk turns upon the Great War and the wonderful victory of Civilization;\r\nwhen we are questioned as to who and what we are and we reply simply:\r\n\"Gentlemen, I am a Canadian\"----\r\n\r\nThen may the light of pride in our eyes be undimmed by any sense of shame\r\nfor duty shunned.  May it be that out of it all has arisen a higher\r\nconception of individual and national life.  So that in place of deep\r\nfurrows of dissension there will be the level seed-bed of greater unity\r\nand justice among men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Abnormal conditions in the grain trade at present, due to the war,\r\nhave led to government control of the crop by means of a Board of Grain\r\nSupervisors, aside altogether from the permanent Board of Grain\r\nCommissioners.  This government commission has very wide powers,\r\nsuperseding the Grain Act for the time being, and can fix the price at\r\nwhich grain stored in any elevator may be purchased, ascertain available\r\nsupplies, fix conditions of removal from storage and determine the\r\ndestination of grain, receive purchase offers and fix sale prices, take\r\npossession of grain in elevators and sell it, provide transportation, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Grain Supervisors consists of two representatives of the\r\norganized farmers--Hon. T. A. Crerar, Minister of Agriculture, and H. W.\r\nWood, President of United Farmers of Alberta; one representative of\r\nunorganised farmers--S. K. Rathwell; three representatives of the\r\nWinnipeg Grain Exchange--J. C. Gage, W. E. Bawlf and Dr. Magill\r\n(Chairman); a representative of the British Food Commission--Jas.\r\nStewart; two representatives of Labor--Controller Ainey (Montreal) and W.\r\nB. Best, of Locomotive Firemen; W. A. Matheson, of Lake of the Woods\r\nMilling Company, and Lionel H. Clarke, head of the Canada Malting Company\r\nand a member of the Toronto Harbor Commission.  Dr. Robert Magill, the\r\nChairman, is Secretary of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and was formerly\r\nChief Commissioner of the permanent Board of Grain Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, COMMITTEES, ETC., OF THE FARMERS'\r\n  MOVEMENT IN WESTERN CANADA, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Territorial_ (Saskatchewan) _Grain Growers' Association--1902_.\r\n\r\nPresident, W.

A. Partridge, of Sintaluta,\r\nSask., the first official action being taken by the Manitoba Grain\r\nGrowers' Association at their annual convention in 1905, when the\r\nfollowing committee was ordered to investigate and report:\r\n\r\nChairman, E. A. Partridge (Sintaluta, Sask.); J. A. Taylor (Cartwright,\r\nMan.); A. S. Barton (Boissevain, Man.).\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  _Local Committee to Organise Meeting of Sintaluta Farmers--1906_.\r\n\r\nThe following committee of Sintaluta farmers made arrangements for a\r\nmeeting of the farmers in the Sintaluta district to discuss\r\nco-operative trading in grain and to pledge support of the trading\r\ncompany proposed by E. A. Partridge:\r\n\r\nE. A. Partridge, Al Quigley, Dave Railton, W. J. Bonner, T. McLeod,\r\nJames Ewart.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  _Preliminary Organisation Committee of Sintaluta Farmers--1906_.\r\n\r\nE. A.

A. Partridge; Vice-President, John Kennedy;\r\nSecretary-Treasurer, John Spencer; Directors: W. A. Robinson (Elva,\r\nMan.), and Francis Graham (Melita, Man.).\r\n\r\nAt a general meeting of the shareholders these same officers were\r\nelected subsequently and the directorate increased by two--Robert\r\nCruise (Dauphin) and T. W. Knowles (Emerson).\r\n\r\n\r\n8.  _Sintaluta_ (Sask.) _Farmers Who Pledged Personal Securities--1906_.\r\n\r\nFinding themselves $1,500 short of the necessary $2,500 for the\r\npurchase of a seat on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, the young trading\r\ncompany of farmers had recourse to personal securities in order to\r\nfinance their start in business.  The friends to whom E. A. Partridge\r\nappealed and who immediately gave the bank their personal notes were\r\nthe following Sintaluta men:\r\n\r\nDave Railton, Al Quigley, Tom McLeod, Jim Ewart, William E. Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.  _Inter-Provincial Council of Grain Growers' and Farmers'\r\nAssociations--1907_.\r\n\r\nIt was under this name that the executive officers of the various\r\nfarmers' organizations in the three Prairie Provinces first came\r\ntogether to discuss problems affecting the Movement as a whole.  The\r\nfirst officers of the Inter-Provincial Council were:\r\n\r\nPresident, E. N. Hopkins (Moose Jaw, Sask.); Secretary, M. D. Geddes\r\n(Calgary, Alberta).\r\n\r\n\r\n10.  _United Farmers of Alberta--1909_.\r\n\r\nUntil January 14th, 1909, the farmers of Alberta had two provincial\r\norganizations--the \"Canadian Society of Equity\" and the \"Alberta\r\nFarmers' Association.\"  On this date amalgamation took place at\r\nEdmonton under the name, \"United Farmers of Alberta\" with officers and\r\ndirectors as follows:\r\n\r\nPresident, James Bower (Red Deer); Vice-President, Rice Sheppard\r\n(Strathcona); Secretary, Edward J.
