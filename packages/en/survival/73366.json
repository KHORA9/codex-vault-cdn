Vuta as topographer,\r\nstarted from Minia and explored the eastern half of the area, while Mr.\r\nBeadnell with Mr. L. Gorringe as his topographer started from Maghagha\r\nand examined the western side of the oasis. The expeditions commenced\r\nwork in October, and mapping on the scale of ¹⁄₅₀₀₀₀ the whole area\r\nwas surveyed before the end of the year. The return traverses were\r\nmade to Minia by the first party via Farafra to Assiut by the second.\r\nThe following chapters and maps set forth the results of this joint\r\nexploration, certain gaps being filled from the data of Ascherson.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BAHARIA OASIS\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oasis of Baharia (or Northern Oasis), also known as the Little\r\nOasis, lies between the parallels 27° 48′ and 28° 30′ of north\r\nlatitude, and between the meridians 28° 35′ and 29° 10′ east\r\nof Greenwich, being thus situated in the Libyan Desert about 180\r\nkilometres, or four to five days’ march by camel, west of the Nile\r\nValley (Sketchmap, Plate II). Like the other oases of the Western\r\nDesert (Farafra, Dakhla and Kharga) to the south, Baharia is a large\r\nnatural excavation in the great Libyan plateau; it differs, however,\r\nfrom those oases, which are open on one or more sides, in being\r\nentirely surrounded by escarpments, and the vast number of isolated\r\nhills within the depression form an unique topographical feature. In\r\nBaharia, as, with the exception of Dakhla, in the oases generally,\r\nthe cultivated area bears only a very small proportion to the total\r\noasis-area, the remainder of the floor of the natural excavation\r\nbeing barren desert. The oasis contains four principal villages,\r\nall situated in its northern portion, and it is in the neighbourhood\r\nof these that water, and consequently vegetation, is most abundant.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Baharia is shrouded in an obscurity greater even\r\nthan that surrounding the history of Kharga. That it was inhabited\r\nat a very early date is shown however by a stela of the reign\r\nof Thothmes II (about B.C. 1600-1500) found there by Ascherson,\r\nby a tomb of the 19th dynasty (B.C. 1300) and fragments of two\r\ntemples, one dating from the reign of King Apries (B.C. 588-570)\r\nand the other from the reign of Amasis (B.C. 569-526), discovered\r\nby Steindorff in 1900, and by the references to it in the Ptolemaic\r\ninscriptions of the temple of Edfu. The oasis of Baharia is referred\r\nto in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of its newly-discovered temples as\r\n“the northern oasis of Amenhotep,” and as “the oasis Huye”;\r\nby Strabo it is called δεύτερα “_the second_” and by\r\nPtolemy ὄασις μικρὰ “_the small oasis_.” The Romans\r\nhave left traces of their occupation of Baharia in an arch near the\r\nvillage of El Qasr[1] and other ruins, as well as in numerous wells\r\nand underground aqueducts, which latter are still used by the present\r\ninhabitants. Fragmentary ruins of churches and a Coptic village attest\r\nthe fact of the occupation of the place during Christian times. At\r\npresent Baharia, along with the neighbouring oasis of Farafra to\r\nthe south, is administered as part of the Mudiria of Minia, and is\r\nfairly prosperous, though lacking in enterprise to an even greater\r\nextent than is shown by the two southern oases of Dakhla and Kharga.\r\n\r\nThe first European traveller to reach the oasis of Baharia appears\r\nto have been _Belzoni_,[2] who reached it from Beni Suef on May 26th,\r\n1819, and after spending some eleven days there returned by the same\r\nroute. Though his observations appear to have been correctly made,\r\nthe description of his travels is largely coloured by imagination,\r\nand his map appears only to have been a rough sketch. He erroneously\r\nconfused Baharia with the oasis of Jupiter Ammon, whose temple he\r\nimagined he had found in the remains of the Roman arch near El Qasr,\r\nthe chief village of the oasis. It is hardly necessary to remark\r\nthat the oasis of Jupiter Ammon is really that now known as Siwa,\r\nsituated some 340 kilometres west-north-west of Baharia.\r\n\r\nThe earliest connected modern account of the oasis of any value\r\nis that of _Cailliaud_,[3] who with Letorzec visited the place in\r\n1820 on his way from Siwa to Farafra, and during a stay of about\r\nsix weeks examined and mapped some of its principal features. He\r\ndrew attention to its antiquities and gave a careful description of\r\nthe hot springs and ancient aqueducts, besides taking a number of\r\nobservations of latitude and noting some of the topographical and\r\ngeological features, such as the occurrence of volcanic rocks in\r\nthe oasis. Cailliaud records his meeting in Baharia with Hyde, an\r\nEnglish traveller, who, however, does not appear to have published\r\nany account of his wanderings.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1823-1824 Baharia was visited by _Pacho_ in company\r\nwith F. Muller. In an account of Pacho’s travels[4] published\r\nafter his unhappy death, there is no reference to his observations\r\nin this oasis beyond an indication of his route on the map.\r\n\r\n_Wilkinson_[5] visited the oasis of Baharia in 1825.\r\n\r\nThe Rohlfs’ expedition of 1874,[6] with the distinguished scientists\r\nK. von Zittel and W. Jordan as geologist and topographer respectively,\r\nadded very considerably to our knowledge of Baharia, more especially\r\nin the way of fixing precisely the geographical positions and levels\r\nof its principal points. Zittel, however, did not visit this oasis,\r\nand in consequence its geological structure was not studied, the few\r\nreferences to it made in the publications of the Rohlfs’ expedition\r\nbeing based on an examination of specimens collected by Ascherson.\r\n\r\nProbably the most accurate map hitherto existing of Baharia Oasis\r\nis that of _Ascherson_,[7] who spent nearly three months there in\r\n1876. Ascherson, who entered the oasis by the road from the Fayum\r\nand returned to Samalut, chiefly directed his attention to botanical\r\nobservations, but his memoir contains some valuable topographical\r\nand geological information which supplements that of previous and\r\nlater observers in important measure; he has also the distinction\r\nof finding the stela of the reign of Thothmes III already referred\r\nto, and the remains of an Egyptian temple; the latter is probably\r\nidentical with one of those discovered by Steindorff in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe short memoir by _Capt. H. G. Lyons_, R.E.,[8] published in 1894,\r\nbrought together a number of observations on the geology of the Libyan\r\nDesert generally, and his discovery of fossils, referred to _Exogyra\r\nOverwegi_, for the first time established the Upper Cretaceous age\r\nof the clays and sandstones forming the floor and lower part of the\r\nscarp in the northern end of the depression.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the Geological Survey carried out its examination, the\r\nresults of which are set forth in the following chapters.\r\n\r\nSince the survey expedition, Baharia has been visited by\r\nSteindorff,[9] who during his five days’ stay in the oasis made\r\nimportant additions to our knowledge of its antiquities. These will\r\nbe further referred to in the chapter on the topography of the oasis.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This ruin was described by CAILLIAUD (_Voyage à\r\nMéroé. etc._, vol.

It was desirable\r\nto fix this meeting-point as a primary station for the subsequent\r\nplotting of the maps. Cailliaud[10] gave the latitude of Zubbo as\r\n28° 21′ 47″, and its longitude as 26° 43′ 46″ E. of Paris,\r\n(equivalent to 29° 3′ 55″ E. of Greenwich). Jordan gave for\r\nBawitti the position N. lat. 28° 21′ 12″, long. E. of Greenwich\r\n28° 56′ 45″. Taking the difference of latitude and longitude\r\nbetween Bawitti and Zubbo as found by the Survey, viz., lat. +\r\n55″, long. + 4′ 16″, we have as the equivalent of Jordan’s\r\nlatitude for Zubbo 28° 22′ 7″, and for his longitude 29° 1′\r\n1″ E. of Greenwich. Thus, while there is a fair agreement between\r\nthe two authors as regards latitude, there is a difference of 2′\r\n54″ in the values of the longitude.\r\n\r\nThe longitude is of course always the difficult matter in the\r\ngeographical determination of places not easy of access. Cailliaud’s\r\nvalue rests on the method of distance and azimuths, both roughly\r\ndetermined only; Jordan, on the other hand, used the absolute\r\nthough not very precise method of lunar distances measured with a\r\nsextant. The Survey parties depended entirely on direct measurement\r\nby means of measuring-wheels from known points in the Nile Valley;\r\nthe values obtained in this way are tabulated below[11].\r\n\r\n\r\nI.—_Traverse from Maghagha to Zubbo._\r\n\r\n  Maghagha Railway Station, long.

E. of Greenwich             30   45   39\r\n                                                           -------------\r\n                             Giving long. of Zubbo         28   58   54\r\n\r\nThe arithmetic mean of these three determinations is 28° 56′\r\n55″; owing, however, to the breakdown of the measuring-wheel\r\nduring the outward traverse from Maghagha, and the consequent\r\nnecessity of estimating a part of the distance traversed by the\r\ntime taken in marching, the different traverses are not equal in\r\nvalue, and the longitude finally adopted by the survey, as the\r\nbest approximation after investigation of the various sources of\r\nerror in the measurements, was 28° 58′ 34″. It would thus\r\nappear that Jordan’s position may be a little too far east,\r\nthe difference amounting to 2′ 27″, or about 3½ kilometres,\r\nwhile Cailliaud’s value would place the position at a rather less\r\ndistance west of that adopted.\r\n\r\nThe survey observations confirmed the accuracy of Jordan’s latitude\r\n(28° 22′ 7″), from which the value found by Cailliaud differs,\r\nas already remarked, only slightly.\r\n\r\nThe surveying operations within the oasis were based on a rapid\r\nplane-table triangulation from a measured base line within\r\nit, details being simultaneously sketched in, on a scale of\r\n¹⁄₅₀₀₀₀. The site chosen for the base was a level stretch\r\nof ground extending between the camp at Zubbo and an isolated clump\r\nof date-palms to the north-east; the length of this line was found\r\nby repeated wheel-measurement to be 3·88 kilometres. The two parties\r\nran off their triangulations from this base to the surrounding hills,\r\nand carried on the mapping southward by plane-table, taking stations\r\nchiefly on the hills and prominent points of the scarps, and not\r\nmeeting again till Ain el Haiss, in the southern part of the oasis,\r\nwas reached. Here a test was made as to agreement of the two sets\r\nof maps, only a small difference being found. The position of Ain\r\nel Haiss, as found by taking the mean of the two determinations,\r\nis latitude 28° 2′ 11″ N., longitude 28° 39′ 19″ E. of\r\nGreenwich; this places the spring about 4′ 18″ east of Jordan’s\r\ndetermination (lat. 28° 1′ 55″ N., long. 28° 13′ 47″\r\nE. of Green.).\r\n\r\nThe two parties made a third connection at the extreme south end\r\nof the oasis-depression. Our observations for this point give its\r\nlatitude as 27° 48′ 13″ N., and its longitude as 28° 32′\r\n19″ E. of Greenwich, placing it very near the position shown on\r\nJordan’s map.\r\n\r\nThe plane-table method making use of the magnetic meridian,\r\nit was imperative to determine the amount of declination of the\r\ncompass. This was done at one point only, viz., at the south end\r\nof the oasis, the value found (by observation of the transit of\r\nPolaris) being 4° 50′ W. The declination is fairly constant\r\nover the entire area, except near the eruptive dolerite masses,\r\nthe magnetite in which causes a very sensible deflection of the\r\nneedle; in the neighbourhood of these, however, the surveying was\r\ncarried on independently of the compass. With regard to the yearly\r\nchange of declination, we have as data the previous observations\r\nof Cailliaud, who found the declination at Zubbo in January, 1820,\r\nto be 12° 13′ W.; of Jordan, who obtained the value 6° 56′\r\nW. in March, 1874; and of Capt. Lyons,[12] whose observations with\r\na Bamberg declinatorium at Mandisha in April, 1894, gave the value\r\n5° 8·9′ W. Tabulating these:—\r\n\r\n      Observer.          Date.

It would seem proved from the three foregoing\r\nobservations that the yearly variation is at present decreasing,\r\nthe mean from 1820 to 1874 being 6′·3 as against 4′·2 for the\r\nperiod 1874-1894. This decrease is also noticeable in comparisons of\r\nthe declinations observed at different times in other parts of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe _altitudes above sea-level_ of the principal points, more\r\nespecially in the eastern half of the oasis, were determined with\r\na Watkin aneroid barometer, which had been compared with the Cairo\r\nstandard mercurial barometer. A fairly long stay was made at the\r\nZubbo camp, and the altitude of this point may be regarded as fairly\r\naccurately fixed by the observations tabulated below:—\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+-------------+--------------+---------------\r\n                         |   Zubbo.    |    Cairo.    |\r\n     Date and Time.      |    Bar.     |     Bar.     |   Difference.\r\n                         |(corrected). | (corrected). |\r\n  -----------------------+-------------+--------------+---------------\r\n                         |    mm.      |      mm.     |       mm.\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n  October 12, 6 p.m.     |  753·54     |    761·10    |      7·56\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n    „     14, 8 a.m.     |  754·94     |    763·04    |      8·10\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n    „         6 p.m.     |  753·79     |    761·53    |      7·74\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n    „     15, 7.30 a.m.  |  754·55     |    762·60    |      8·05\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n    „         9 p.m.     |  754·30     |    762·64    |      8·34\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n    „     17, 7.15 a.m.  |  754·18     |    761·84    |      7·66\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n    „     18, 7 a.m.     |  753·79     |    761·64    |      7·85\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n                 noon    |  752·52     |    761·34    |      8·82\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n    „     19, 8.30 a.m.  |  752·65     |    762·31    |      9·66\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n  Nov.,   26, 3 p.m.     |  754·81     |    763·29    |      8·48\r\n                         |             |              |\r\n    „     27, 8 a.m.     |  754·81     |    764·12    |      9·31\r\n  -----------------------+-------------+--------------+---------------\r\n                                                Mean  |      8·32\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSince 1 mm. of mercury corresponds at the mean temperature of\r\nobservation (20° C.) to 11·4 metres of height, we have height\r\nof Zubbo camp above Cairo observatory = 8·32 × 11·4 = 94·7, or\r\nsay 95 metres. Since the observatory is 33 metres above sea-level,\r\nthe camp at Zubbo is 128 metres above sea-level. Jordan’s altitude\r\nfor Bawitti, which probably lies at about the same level as Zubbo,\r\nis 113 metres, and when it is remembered that the point of the\r\nSurvey’s observation lay not in Zubbo itself, but at the camp on\r\nelevated ground some 10 or 12 metres above it, the results show a\r\nvery good agreement.\r\n\r\nAt Ain el Haiss three barometric observations were taken on different\r\ndays; the comparison of these with the Cairo records would place this\r\npoint 156 metres above sea-level. Jordan’s value is 122 metres,\r\nthe number of observations on which this figure is based not being\r\nstated, it is difficult to say which of the two altitudes is the\r\nmore probable.\r\n\r\nAt the remaining camps within the oasis, and at the camps _en route_\r\nbetween the oasis and Minia, corresponding observations were taken,\r\nthe number of comparisons with Cairo varying from two to seven at an\r\nindividual station. These observations being reduced and corrected by\r\ncomparison among themselves gave the levels of the different camps\r\nwith some degree of approximation to accuracy, and the altitudes of\r\nintermediate points were found by interpolation based on barometric\r\nreadings. The resulting altitudes will be found on the map (Plate I);\r\nwhere no altitudes have been taken by the Survey, the values given\r\nby Ascherson on his map have been inserted.\r\n\r\nThe statistics relating to the oasis, and the methods of cleaning\r\nout wells, are based on information supplied by the Government\r\nofficials at Bawitti, and may be taken as fairly reliable. The\r\nparticulars regarding water-supply are of course based mainly on\r\ndirect observation during the survey of the villages.\r\n\r\nThe botany of the oasis having been fully studied by Ascherson[13]\r\nno attempt was made by the Survey to collect or describe the plants\r\nmet with. The abundant growths of the beautiful maiden-hair fern\r\n(_Adiantum Capillus Veneris_)[14] will not, however, fail to strike\r\neven the casual visitor to the old Roman aqueducts, which still\r\nserve as the principal water-channels of the oasis. Nor were the\r\nanimals of the oasis made the subject of any detailed observations,\r\nalthough the existence of several of the species of lizards and snakes\r\ncommon to the Nile Valley was recorded, and specimens collected when\r\neasily obtainable.\r\n\r\nBaharia is not rich in archæological remains, and, with few\r\nexceptions, even those existing were not examined by the Survey,\r\nthough the positions of all ruins met with during the work were\r\nmapped. In a later chapter will be found a connected though brief\r\naccount of all the antiquities noted, the publications of previous\r\nauthors being referred to wherever the descriptions cannot be given\r\nfrom personal observations.\r\n\r\nThe principal point attended to in the topographical mapping by\r\nthe survey was the accurate delineation of the bounding scarps\r\nof the oasis and of the large number of hills within it. These\r\nfeatures, of which an accurate map was essential for any proper\r\nconsideration of the geology, had been only rapidly sketched by\r\nprevious travellers, and the precise shape of the oasis was still\r\nunknown. In the cultivated spots, on the other hand, much had\r\nbeen done by Cailliaud, Jordan and Ascherson towards mapping the\r\ndetail. Hence, beyond re-determining the precise positions of the main\r\npoints and the general limits of the cultivated areas, no attempt\r\nat detailed mapping in these areas was undertaken by the Survey\r\nparties, it being felt that it would be preferable in the limited\r\ntime available to concentrate attention on the almost totally unknown\r\nfeatures, so essential to any geological consideration, rather than\r\nto devote considerable time to the details of the inhabited spots.\r\n\r\nThus, while the field maps resulting from the survey represented\r\nthe oasis for the first time in its true shape, and the hills\r\nwithin it in their true relative magnitudes and positions, they\r\nfell somewhat short of the maps of Ascherson and Cailliaud in the\r\nnumber of springs, ruins, etc., shown. The more important ruins\r\noverlooked by the survey have, however, been inserted approximately\r\nfrom existing maps, and the whole result (Plates I, III and VII),\r\nis an advance on the existing representations.\r\n\r\nThe _geology_ of the oasis was very carefully investigated, this being\r\na field in which comparatively little had been done, and a number of\r\nvery interesting results were obtained. The principal points in this\r\nconnection worthy of note resulting from the detailed examination\r\nof the scarps and hills are—\r\n\r\n(i) The existence of a marked unconformity between the Upper\r\nCretaceous and Eocene strata, thus confirming the unconformity between\r\nthese two great systems which had been noted[15] earlier at Abu Roash;\r\nthis unconformity has now been remarked in many parts of Egypt.[16]\r\nThe palæontological proofs of this unconformity were obtained from\r\nthe western scarp, the beds of the eastern side, though they show\r\nthe same thickening, being much poorer in fossils;\r\n\r\n(ii) The occurrence of an extensive series of Upper Cretaceous beds\r\nof Cenomanian to Danian age within the depression and forming a\r\nlarge part of the desert to the west;\r\n\r\n(iii) The precise extent and relations of the dolerite capping some\r\nof the sandstone hills in the north of the depression;\r\n\r\n(iv) The existence of well-marked folding having an important bearing\r\non the origin of the oasis;\r\n\r\n(v) The presence of ferruginous sandstone deposits of later origin\r\nthan the primary formation of the oasis-hollow, though long anterior\r\nto the date when the work of excavation, which gave the oasis its\r\npresent form, took place.\r\n\r\nThese points will be found discussed at some length in the chapter\r\non the geology of the oasis.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Op. cit._, vol.

Other well-known\r\nroutes run from the Fayum, from Bahnessa, Samalut (Ascherson) and\r\nDelga, in the Nile Valley, from Alexandria, via Mogara, and from Siwa\r\n(Jordan, Cailliaud). The Survey’s return traverse to Minia from\r\nthe south end of Baharia did not follow any defined road, but kept\r\non the open plateau on a course computed from the known positions\r\nof the points of departure and destination.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Road from Feshn and Maghagha to Baharia.]\r\n\r\n_The road from Feshn and Maghagha to Baharia_ leaves the edge of the\r\nNile Valley cultivation at Qasr el Lamlum Bey, which bears 51½°\r\nwest of true north from Maghagha railway station, and is distant\r\n15·4 kilometres. From this point the road is well-defined and\r\neasily followed right into the oasis. In the following description\r\nthe distances are given from the edge of the Nile Valley cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe road at first leads over a strip of drift sand, half a kilometre\r\nbroad, with short prickly scrub, passing a white mosque on the\r\nleft and then turning off somewhat to a direction 26° south of\r\nwest, and continuing in a straight line for 15 kilometres over an\r\nundulating gravelly plain. The high prominent cliffs, about 7 or\r\n8 kilometres to the north-west, are the flanks of Jebel Muailla,\r\nand a valley known as Wadi Muailla leads through them to the Wadi\r\nRayan in the Fayum depression.[18] At 19 kilometres the valley scarp,\r\nwith a number of isolated peaks, is approached on the right, while\r\nridges and low mounds form the plain below, well-marked lines of\r\ndrainage running from here in a south-east direction towards the\r\ncultivation. At 23 kilometres the scarp runs back, enclosing a large\r\nbay, across which the road runs and ascends to the plateau beyond at\r\n27·8 kilometres. Numerous isolated parallel sand-dunes in the form\r\nof small ridges are seen running out into the bay from the cliff\r\nat the far end, all lying slightly west of north and east of south,\r\nor parallel to the normal wind direction.\r\n\r\nThe escarpment bounding the Nile Valley at this point is only some\r\n15 metres in height, being thus quite insignificant compared with\r\nthe cliffs on the east side. The plateau here was found to be about\r\n140 metres above the cultivation, the road having risen gradually\r\nthroughout. The latter continues for about 1½ kilometres across\r\nthe strip of plateau when it again descends, making a slight detour\r\nto the left for easy descent. It then continues 9° south of west,\r\nslightly winding, over gravelly undulating ground. At 31-32 kilometres\r\na line of low hills is passed on the right, while a dark well-marked\r\nrange lies 6-7 kilometres to the left.\r\n\r\nA ridge of sandstone, known as Jebel el Ghudda, is passed on the\r\nright at 45 kilometres, from the end of which a small dune runs out;\r\nbeyond, the plain resumes its monotonous undulating character, a low\r\nridge being crossed at 61 kilometres. There, the road, consisting\r\nof a number of more or less parallel well-marked narrow paths worn\r\nby camels, which have a somewhat general habit of marching in line\r\none behind the other, changes its direction to 36° south of west,\r\nfalling gradually in level until a patch of scrub is reached 6½\r\nkilometres further on. This scrub was dead at the time of the\r\nvisit, and furnished a useful supply of fuel. From this point the\r\ncourse is 7° south of west (true), which direction is maintained\r\nfor the next 42 kilometres over a remarkably monotonous undulating\r\ngravel-covered desert, the typical “serir” of the Arabs. At 92\r\nand 93½ kilometres some more patches of dead scrub were passed on\r\nthe right, while logs of silicified wood were noticed strewing the\r\nplain on the left. An Arab grave was met with at 96 kilometres, while\r\nskeletons of camels lie about near the roadside at frequent intervals;\r\nat 110 kilometres the eye of the traveller is relieved by a small\r\ngrove of green thorny flat-topped acacia trees (_Acacia nilotica_,\r\nor “sunt” of the Arabs) with a patch of coarse grass; four gazelle\r\n(probably _Gazella dorcas_) were observed browsing on the scrub here.\r\n\r\nThe course now continues 12½° south of west, over gently undulating\r\ngravelly “serir”, until the eastern scarp of El Bahr is reached\r\nat 125 kilometres from the cultivation of the Nile Valley. The\r\n“serir” or undulating gravelly type of desert then ceases.\r\n\r\nEl Bahr is a depression, some 60-70 metres deep, cut out in white\r\nlimestone rocks; its breadth at the point crossed by the road was 8\r\nkilometres. Within it are several high prominent hills, one of which\r\nnear the centre on the left side of the road is called Jebel Gar\r\nMarzak. The bottom of the depression was quite green with vegetation;\r\nsufficient water is said to fall every year to keep these plants\r\nalive, and in 1894 rain is said to have fallen to such an extent\r\nthat a pool of considerable size was formed; the silt deposited by\r\nthis is plainly visible at the present time. A good deal of blown\r\nsand occurs within the depression. El Bahr evidently corresponds to\r\nthe Bahr Bela Ma, (river without water) figured on some authors’\r\nmaps, which has been frequently but erroneously referred to as an\r\nold river-course; although this idea was shown to be untenable by\r\nZittel[19] and Ascherson[20] it has subsequently been maintained\r\nby non-scientific writers. No traces of any river deposit occur in\r\nthe depression, which consists simply of a series of unconnected\r\ndepressions, eroded by wind-borne sand.[21]\r\n\r\nThe track leaves the depression at 134 kilometres, rising over\r\nheavy sand; it then continues 3° north of west. The character of\r\nthe desert has now completely changed, and instead of the smooth\r\nundulating gravelly “serir,” its surface is rough and hummocky,\r\nbeing formed of hard bare limestone, cut up into sharp knobs and\r\ngrooved into furrows by the powerful action of wind-borne sand;\r\nit resembles closely the surface of the rough open sea. This type\r\nof desert is spoken of as “kharafish” by the Arabs. While\r\nthe “serir” forms an ideal surface for travelling over, the\r\n“kharafish” is the worst imaginable, the innumerable hillocks\r\nnecessitating incessant small deviations, while the hard rough\r\nsurface is in some places very troublesome to camels; moreover,\r\nan extensive view is out of the question and no tracks are visible\r\non the surface, so that the road is easily lost except where marked\r\nby frequent cairns built of loose stones.\r\n\r\nOccasional patches of blown sand are here met with, and the first\r\nwell-marked dunes were crossed at 141 kilometres. From here onwards\r\nfor kilometres the whole area was more or less sandy with occasional\r\nnarrow well-marked ridges or dunes, running almost due north and\r\nsouth, and varying in breadth from that of a single line to a\r\nnumber of parallel ridges side by side half a kilometre broad. The\r\nlargest dune of this group at 146½ kilometres is known as Ghard el\r\nShubbab. The steepest sides are those facing west where the angle\r\nmay reach 30°.\r\n\r\nAt the particular locality crossed by this road the sand area is very\r\neasily crossed, a circuitous route being followed in order to take\r\nadvantage of the flatter dunes with the easiest slopes when crossing\r\nthe steeper ridges. Probably the road crosses at one of the easiest\r\npoints. This remarkable line of dunes, known as the Abu Moharik,\r\nhas its origin in the neighbourhood of the oasis of Mogara and runs\r\nsouthward, almost without a break, across the desert until Kharga is\r\nreached, whence with a slight break owing to the broken character of\r\nthe ground it continues southward within the oasis-depression. The\r\ntotal width of the sand-belt on the road under description is about\r\n6 kilometres.\r\n\r\nAt 153 to 156 kilometres a number of black conical hills, Gar el\r\nHamra, are situate from 1 to 2 kilometres from the road on the south\r\nside. One or two more sand-dunes were crossed and then the road,\r\nmaintaining its direction of 2°-3° north of west, lay over a more\r\nor less uneven dark-coloured limestone desert broken up into a number\r\nof small hills. At 169 kilometres a broad ridge of sand-dunes was\r\nencountered, running 18° west of true north. These light yellow\r\ndunes afford a beautiful and remarkable sight, running northwards\r\naway to the horizon over a dark brown-coloured desert in an almost\r\nperfectly straight line and with a sharply maintained junction-line\r\nbetween the edge of the sand and the desert surface adjoining.\r\n\r\nWithin a few hundred metres of the western side of the sand-dunes\r\nthe road commences the descent from the plateau into the\r\noasis-depression. The road enters at the most northerly extremity\r\nof the oasis, the descent being particularly easy at this point,\r\npassing the large dark-coloured hill, Jebel Horabi (or Morabi?),\r\non the right almost immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\nA fine view of the depression is obtainable from the top of the\r\nescarpment, a broad low-lying expanse, bounded by steep escarpments or\r\nwalls, stretching away to the south, its monotony relieved by several\r\nlarge flat-topped hill-masses, near which, on the lowest portions of\r\nthe floor, dark areas, the cultivated lands and palm-groves can be\r\ndistinguished. The road crosses the depression in a south-westerly\r\ndirection, passes a spring known as Ain el Gidr, the first watering\r\nplace, and divides in front of the great hill-masses separating the\r\ntwo groups of villages, the eastern branch keeping close under the\r\neastern scarp of Jebel Mayesra, to avoid a large area of soft salty\r\nground, and leading to the villages of Zubbo and Mandisha, While the\r\nwestern branch continues its course to the cultivation surrounding El\r\nQasr and Bawitti. The distance by this road from Qasr el Lamlum Bey to\r\nthe village of Zubbo is 190 kilometres and to Bawitti 195 kilometres.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geology of the Feshn-Baharia]\r\n\r\nHaving now described the topographical features of this road, the\r\nchief geological characters may be noticed. The plain between the\r\nNile Valley cultivation and the scarp of the plateau is covered with\r\nsandy gravel, partly downwash from the higher ground in Recent times,\r\nand partly the remains of definite gravel deposits belonging to the\r\nNile Valley Pleistocene series.[22] The pebbles now found strewn\r\nover the plain consist chiefly of flints, doubtless derived from\r\nthe Eocene limestones forming the deserts on both sides of the Nile\r\nValley, and occasional pebbles of hard felspar porphyry which must\r\nhave originally been derived from the igneous massifs of the Red Sea\r\nHills. Both are well rounded, although the former are frequently\r\nbroken up into angular fragments by temperature changes. White\r\ngranular beds of gypsum, of various degrees of impurity, crop out on\r\nthe plain in places, and in all probability there was in Pleistocene\r\ntimes an extensive deposit of this mineral all over the surface of\r\nthe low-lying country. In the desert lying between the Fayum and\r\nthe Nile Valley further to the north, these gypseous beds occur of\r\ngreat thickness and wide extent, and the deposits crossed on this\r\nroad are doubtless part of the same series.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs of Jebel Muailla to the north are capped by a hard dark\r\nbed of limestone, which weathers with a vertical face, while the more\r\ngentle slopes, generally more or less hidden with sand, are doubtless\r\nformed of softer limestones, marls, and clays. During the survey of\r\nthe Fayum (see foot-note, p. 17) the hills surrounding Wadi Muailla\r\nwere found to be formed of Lower Mokattam beds (Middle Eocene)\r\nand the hills seen from this road are doubtless composed of the\r\nsame beds. The ridges crossed at 20 kilometres are formed of hard,\r\ncompact, close-grained crystalline limestone, covered with more or\r\nless gypsum and flint gravel; the limestone beds forming these ridges\r\nshow dips which suggest the existence of a fault running N.E.-S.W.,\r\nparallel to the trend of the cliff behind, and this may be part\r\nof the extensive faults and folds of the Nile Valley. In one small\r\nhill (22 kilometres) shales with _Ostrea_ were noticed at the base,\r\nwith occasional hard oyster-limestone bands; the upper part was\r\nformed of 10 metres of gravel consisting of well-rounded limestone\r\npebbles. This superficial deposit must be classed as Pleistocene and\r\nmay be a sea-beach, though no conclusive evidence was obtainable\r\non this point. The escarpment passed at 23 kilometres is capped\r\nby a bed of white limestone, shales forming the slope, but was\r\nnot examined at close quarters. The floor of the bay formed by the\r\nreceding cliff shows outcropping brown limestone with _Ostrea_, and\r\nthe escarpment on the far side is capped by a hard white crystalline\r\nlimestone with much flint, the latter forming bands. On the surface\r\nis a thin calcareous gypseous gravel deposit, doubtless of the same\r\nage as the gypseous beds already mentioned as occurring on the\r\nplain below. The flanks of the scarp are hidden by downwash. The\r\ncliff bounding this strip of plateau, 1½ kilometres further on,\r\nis composed of the same beds, the limestone being here silicified,\r\nwith large silicified _Conidæ_. With regard to the age of these\r\nlimestones and clays they are probably equivalent to part of the Lower\r\nMokattam series already mentioned as forming the hill-masses round\r\nWadi Rayan, although no _Nummulites gizehensis_ beds were observed\r\nin the sections examined. A conspicuous black knob among the low\r\ngravelly hills left two kilometres on the right at 32 kilometres,\r\nwas found to be a neck of hard dark andesitic basalt, one of the few\r\noccurrences of igneous rocks in the Western Desert. Several other\r\nsimilar looking dark hills were in sight, but time did not admit\r\nof their examination. The dark well-marked range 6-7 kilometres to\r\nthe left of the road is probably identical with a range of hills\r\noccurring 10 kilometres west of Bahnessa, which was mapped[23] during\r\nthe survey of the Nile Valley in 1899, and found to consist of a\r\nmass of andesitic basalt similar to that forming the small neck on\r\nthis road. Doubtless they are both parts of the same intrusion. The\r\nsurface of the plain is still composed in part of gypseous deposits,\r\nwith occasional outcrops of the underlying limestone, the surface\r\nbeing covered with a certain amount of loose sand with rounded flints\r\nand their broken fragments. In the neighbourhood of Jebel el Ghudda\r\nthe plain consists of limestone with numerous individuals of the large\r\n_Nummulites gizehensis_, and are thus of Lower Mokattam age. Much of\r\nthe limestone is crystalline. The hills of Jebel el Ghudda are formed\r\nby younger overlying beds consisting of hard silicified sandstones\r\nand grits (quartzites), which lithologically are very similar to\r\nthe beds of Jebel Ahmar near Cairo, of Oligocene age. They may,\r\nhowever, belong to the Upper Eocene series, so well developed above\r\nthe Upper Mokattam in the escarpments to the north of the Fayum, as\r\nthis series contains similar beds with similar silicified wood. They\r\nenclose bands of coarse conglomerate and have a peculiar blackish\r\nburnt colour. Occasional patches of these grits are here and there\r\nmet with right up to the depression of El Bahr, and the silicified\r\nwood passed at 92 kilometres belongs to the same series of beds. From\r\nthe scrub area at 93½ kilometres till the road approached El Bahr\r\nthere was hardly a sign either of the grits or of section anywhere\r\nmet with on this road. The depression is cut down through the upper\r\nseries of sandstones and grits into the fossiliferous white limestones\r\nand sandstones below. The eastern scarp showed the following beds:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._\r\n\r\n                    Soft white Sandstone.\r\n\r\n                  { Limestone with _Nummulites gizehensis_. }\r\n          MIDDLE  {                                         }  Lower\r\n          EOCENE. { Limestone with _Ostrea_, _Exogyra_ and  } Mokattam.\r\n                  { _Lucina_, etc.                          }\r\n\r\nThe floor is covered in places with numerous weathered out individuals\r\nof _N. gizehensis_ and large oysters. Some of the hills occurring\r\nwithin the depression showed brown siliceous limestone overlying white\r\nlimestones with beds containing _Nummulites gizehensis_, _Ostrea_,\r\netc., below. In some of these hills the beds show evidences of\r\nfolding, which like that within the Baharia Oasis may have partly\r\ncaused the formation of the depression by bringing the softer beds\r\nto the surface within the reach of the agents of denudation. On\r\nascending the western scarp, beds with _Ostrea_, _Turritella_,\r\netc., were crossed, and near the top thick yellowish sandstones\r\ncrowded with _Ostrea_ occur. Two of the species of _Ostrea_ were\r\nafterwards examined by Dr. Blanckenhorn, one of which he regarded\r\nas nearly related to _O. Fraasi_, and the other as a new species\r\nwith affinities to _O. Hess_, May-Eym.\r\n\r\nProbably the whole of these fossiliferous beds belong to the Middle\r\nEocene Mokattam Series; the lower beds with _N. gizehensis_, are\r\ncertainly Lower Mokattam, and probably the upper, although the latter\r\nmay represent the base of the Upper Mokattam. Whether the upper bed\r\nof sandstone capping the eastern scarp belongs to the same series\r\nor is equivalent of the silicified grits with silicified wood passed\r\nfurther back is open to some doubt.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Bahr the desert is formed of a hard limestone much cut\r\nup by the action of wind-borne sand as already mentioned. This\r\nlimestone is very unfossiliferous, occasional obscure nummulites\r\nseen on fractured or smooth surfaces being the only indications of\r\nits Eocene age.\r\n\r\nThe conical-peaked hills of Gar el Hamra on the left of the road\r\nat 151 kilometres were so striking that a detour was made specially\r\nto examine them. They were found to be composed of black ferruginous\r\nsilicified sandstone or quartzite at top, with false-bedded sandstones\r\nbelow. They overlie nummulitic limestones forming the surrounding\r\nplain, and are not improbable Post Eocene lacustrine deposits,\r\nsimilar to those within Baharia Oasis (see pp. 60-62).\r\n\r\nFrom here onwards up to the oasis-depression the plateau consists of\r\nhard brown limestone, more or less silicified, and contains nummulites\r\nand oysters. The Eocene strata, thus extend right up to the escarpment\r\nof the depression on the north side of the oasis. The geological\r\nstructure within the depression will be found discussed in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Road from Minia to Baharia.]\r\n\r\n_Road from Minia to Baharia._—The cultivated land extends for some\r\n9 or 10 kilometres west of Minia town, and at the time of the Survey\r\nexpedition (early in October, 1897) this area was mostly covered by\r\nflood-water. Boats were therefore taken to the edge of the desert,\r\nand the march west was commenced from Nasl Nadiub Lengat, a small\r\nvillage on the cultivation-limit in lat. 28° 6′ 24″, long. 30°\r\n39′ 45″ E., bearing from Minia railway station 9° north of\r\nwest, distance very nearly 10 kilometres. The road westward being\r\nill-defined, and the party knowing that any course followed a little\r\nnorth of west would surely lead to the oasis, no attempt was made to\r\nfollow the track precisely, the course being rather chosen to take\r\nadvantage of commanding points so as to map as much topography as\r\npossible _en route_. As will be seen further on, however, the road\r\nwas struck some distance before reaching the oasis, and was thence\r\nfollowed to Zubbo.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Nasl Nadiub Lengat the course first taken was about\r\n32° north of west. The desert here rises very gradually from the\r\nflood-level, (_i.e._ about 40 metres above sea-level), there being\r\nno cliff bounding the Nile Valley on the West at this point. For\r\nabout 6 kilometres the ground was sandy, with occasional patches\r\nof flood-water and some grass; then came a stretch of level\r\ngravelly ground, and at 11½ kilometres some low sand-dunes were\r\ncrossed. The course was now changed to about 3° south of west,\r\nand at 14 kilometres a descent was made from the gravel-plain into\r\na limestone-depression, with gravel-capped eminences on either\r\nside. At 22 kilometres the gravel-strewn plain was again come on,\r\na few low mounds, also gravelly, being passed at 31 kilometres,\r\nand camel-tracks, doubtless part of the Minia-Baharia road, being\r\nnoticed coincident with the survey line at 37 kilometres. Continuing\r\nfollowing these tracks, another camel-road was found to branch off\r\nat 46 kilometres to the north-west. The march was continued along\r\nthe same track going a little more south of west, over a monotonous\r\ngravelly plain, with limestone showing through it in small patches,\r\ntill at 78 kilometres from Nasl Nadiub Lengat a conspicuous though\r\nsmall mass of fissile gritty limestone was come on, which afforded a\r\ngood survey-station. North and west of this are low gravel-covered\r\nhills. Turning a little north of west, a large extent of low\r\ntable-like hills was seen on the south. At about 90 kilometres low\r\nplateaux of limestone, capped by gravel, closed in so as to form\r\na defile about a kilometre wide, through which the line of survey\r\npassed, and at 98 kilometres a large sandy and gravelly depression,\r\nbounded by limestone scarps and containing numerous large limestone\r\nhills, was entered. Within the depression the course followed was\r\nabout 30° north of west, so as to map roughly the escarpments on\r\neither hand. About 10 kilometres from the point where the depression\r\nis entered a long stretch of heavy sand was crossed beyond which\r\ntracks going west were come on, and the edge of the limestone plateau\r\non the left curved round so as to cross the road. Ascending this\r\nlow scarp at 116 kilometres, the course lay over white limestone,\r\nwith sharp angular flints on its surface, and low limestone hills on\r\neither side. At 124 kilometres the broad belt of sand-dunes, the Abu\r\nMoharik, was reached. The dunes, which are of considerable height, run\r\nnearly north and south, and have a total width of some 4 kilometres;\r\nthey formed the most serious obstacle of the entire journey. Beyond\r\nthe dunes is a hard limestone plain, crossed by a low ridge (forming\r\npart of a higher plateau) at 136 kilometres. Beyond this ridge are\r\nlow limestone-hills on either side, the floor being generally of\r\nhard white limestone. At 151 kilometres an oval depression in the\r\nlimestone plateau, with its longer axis (about 4 kilometres) running\r\nW.N.W., was entered; this depression is full of hills of white chalk,\r\nwhich also forms the floor here. Ascending the opposite scarp of\r\nthe depression at 159 kilometres, a narrow strip of higher plateau\r\nof much harder limestone was crossed, the edge of the scarp of the\r\noasis of Baharia being reached at 160 kilometres, after marching for\r\n57 hours from Nasl Nadiub Lengat. Up to this point there had been\r\na gradual rise of the ground, from 40 metres at the Nile Valley to\r\n265 metres above sea-level at the edge of the oasis.\r\n\r\nThe descent into the oasis is not difficult, the scarp being sandy\r\nand the fall gradual. At about 4 kilometres W.N.W. from the edge\r\nof the scarp is the first well or spring of the oasis, _Ain Gelid_\r\n(lat. 28° 19′ 28″ N., long. 29° 8′ 40″ E. of Greenwich),\r\na small pool surrounded by grasses and with a tree growing near\r\nit. The barometric observations gave for this point the level 134\r\nmetres above sea, so that the total drop from the edge of the scarp\r\nis about 130 metres. From Ain Gelid the village of Zubbo bears about\r\n15° north of west, and is some 17 kilometres distant, but owing\r\nto the hills between the two places necessitating a slight detour,\r\nthe actual distance to be traversed is a few kilometres greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geology of the Minia-Baharia Road.]\r\n\r\nThe road from Minia to Baharia shows essentially the same geological\r\nfeatures as the one from Maghagha already described. The gravel which\r\nstrews so large a portion of the road to the east is mainly composed\r\nof quartzite and flint pebbles, of a prevailing brown colour. Some\r\nof the rounded flints show a concentric structure, and are evidently\r\nsegregation-nodules derived from chalk-beds; a very fine specimen\r\nof these, measuring some 20 c.m. in diameter, of almost perfectly\r\nspheroidal form, was obtained. The gravelly covering is frequently\r\nvery thin, the limestones underlying it showing through in numerous\r\nplaces. No evidences of the precise age of this gravel have come\r\nto the authors’ knowledge, but it is certainly Post-Eocene. It\r\nappears to be the same formation which is found covering the edge\r\nof the plateau west of Girga[24] and south of Assuan (east bank)\r\nand at various other points of the Nile Valley. It overlies beds of\r\nevery age from the Nubian Sandstone to the Lower Mokattam.\r\n\r\nThe limestones which underlie the gravel near the Nile, and which are\r\nwell exposed in the depression crossed 14 kilometres from the edge\r\nof the cultivation, are crowded with nummulites of various species,\r\n_N. gizehensis_ and _N. curvispira_ being specially common; these\r\nrocks belong therefore to the Lower Mokattam Series (Middle Eocene).\r\n\r\nThe limestone underlying the gravel further west (from about 30 to\r\n80 kilometres west of the cultivation-limit) is only seen in small\r\npatches; it varies in character, being in some places loose and\r\ntufaceous in texture, and in others gritty and fissile, passing into\r\na calcareous grit. The mass of gritty limestone at 78 kilometres,\r\nnoted above, is about 6 metres in length by 2 metres high and broad;\r\nit shows a peculiar stalagmitic structure, the layers always parallel\r\nto the free surface. Several smaller masses found around all show\r\na similar structure, and where the rock is exposed on the floor\r\nconcentric fissuring is frequently seen. The sand which strews the\r\nsurface here is largely calcareous, being doubtless in part derived\r\nfrom the gritty limestones.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the low hills lying to the left of the track at\r\nabout 85 kilometres from the cultivation-limit show the following\r\nsection (total height about 13 metres):—\r\n\r\n  _Top._\r\n\r\n          1.  Flinty gravel, the flints containing nummulites.\r\n\r\n          2.  Tufaceous white limestone.\r\n\r\n          3.  Hard pink siliceous limestone.\r\n\r\n          4.  Fissile sandy marls and gritty limestones.\r\n\r\nOn the western part of the hills the gravel covering is absent,\r\nthe succession here seen being:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._\r\n\r\n          1.  Sandy marls, 60 centimetres.\r\n\r\n          2.  Very hard pink calcareous grit, 1 metre.\r\n\r\n          3.  White sandy marl, fissile, 2 metres.\r\n\r\n          4.  Soft red and white marls, 10 metres.\r\n\r\nNo fossils were seen in these beds except the nummulites in the\r\ngravel, which prove the latter to be at least in part derived from\r\nEocene deposits.\r\n\r\nThe hills left of the road a little further on show the following\r\nsection:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._\r\n\r\n          1.  Flinty gravel; thin deposit unconformably overlying the\r\n              limestone below.\r\n\r\n          2.  Tufaceous white limestone (thin bed).\r\n\r\n          3.  Hard grey crystalline limestone, 1·2 m.\r\n\r\n          4.  Slope of sand and debris, doubtless covering soft\r\n              marly beds.\r\n\r\nOn entering the depression at 98 kilometres a band of earthy reddish\r\nlimestone with Bryozoa is crossed, this bed appearing to overlie the\r\nfissile sandy limestone already mentioned. From here a good view\r\nof the numerous limestone hills is obtained, the top beds of hard\r\nlimestone showing out sharply from the lower sand-covered slopes;\r\nthe beds show a stratigraphical depression here in addition to the\r\neroded surface depression. The floor of the depression is covered with\r\nsandy gravel and _Ostrea_ shells; an examination of the left scarp,\r\nabout 3 kilometres after entering the hollow, showed the following\r\nsuccession of beds (total height of section 20 metres):—\r\n\r\n  _Top._\r\n\r\n          1.  Hard white limestone with numerous shell-casts and\r\n              containing some shaly layers, 3 m.\r\n\r\n          2.  Debris-covered slope of softer beds with _Ostrea_\r\n              shells, 16 m.\r\n\r\n          3.  Red earthy limestone with shells at base of hill.\r\n\r\nOne of the hills within the depression, to the left of the track\r\nabout 6 kilometres further on, showed in a face of about 28 metres\r\nthe following beds:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._\r\n\r\n          1.  Hard white limestone, sand-eroded.\r\n\r\n          2.  Brown fossiliferous limestone.\r\n\r\n          3.  White limestone with many small fossils.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of this hill were covered with large black _Ostrea_ shells.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the depression further west showed limestones of varying\r\ncharacter, frequently highly fossiliferous. Beyond the depression\r\nthe ground passed over was mainly white limestone, strewn with large\r\nsharp angular flints, and many spheroidal flint-masses derived from\r\nthe limestones. The surrounding hills show that we have here two\r\nwhite limestones with brown beds between, the floor and the hillcaps\r\nbeing white, while the feet of the hills are brown.\r\n\r\nThe plateau-rock near the great belt of sand-dunes is a hard white\r\nlimestone with large _Conidæ_. Just beyond the dunes this rock is\r\nvery siliceous, the exposed surfaces showing a smoky-black colour;\r\nthe rock is however quite white on fracture. The hills rising from\r\nthe plateau here consist entirely of limestone, beds of white chalk\r\nalternating with harder yellowish and brown limestones, in which no\r\nfossils were noticed. Further on the plateau rises, so that at the\r\nentrance to the depression the surface is formed of the same brown\r\nlimestone-beds which are seen in the hills behind. The hills within\r\nthe oval depression here are composed of alternations of chalky with\r\nharder limestones. The narrow ridge which separates the depression\r\njust described from the oasis-depression is of very hard horny\r\nsiliceous limestone.\r\n\r\nOn the descent into the oasis the following beds are passed\r\nthrough:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._\r\n\r\n          1.  Very hard yellowish and reddish-brown siliceous limestone,\r\n              in part crystalline.\r\n\r\n          2.  Fissile sandy limestone.\r\n\r\n          3.  Soft yellow ochreous marly limestone.\r\n\r\n          4.  Greyish-white chalky limestone, with ferruginous layers.\r\n\r\n          5.  Sand-covered slope, mainly consisting of clays.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the entire mass of the limestones forming\r\nthe surface of the plateau are Eocene, occupying an horizon in and\r\nbelow that of the Mokattam series. That the fissile sandy limestone\r\nand calcareous grit cannot be the equivalent of the Post Eocene\r\nsandstone deposits encountered on the road from Maghagha is proved\r\nby their being intercalated in the Eocene limestones of the plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Traverse from south end of Baharia to Minia.]\r\n\r\n_The return journey from Baharia Oasis to Minia_ was made, as already\r\nmentioned, across the open desert, not following any road. The\r\nstarting-point was the point on the southern scarp of the oasis,\r\nwhere the Farafra road leaves Baharia. Our observations give for the\r\nposition of this point[25] lat. 27° 46′ 13″ N. long. 28° 32′\r\n47″ E. of Greenwich; height above sea level, 247 metres. The course\r\nwas shaped so as to reach the village of Nasl Nadiub Lengat, whence\r\nthe outward traverse had started, so as to give a closed polygon of\r\nsurvey-lines. The following topographical and geological notes were\r\ntaken on the journey.\r\n\r\nThe first 2½ kilometres of the way, going about S.S.E., lay over\r\na plateau of sandy limestone, often mammilated and strewn with\r\nlimonite-fragments. Sand-dunes of small size were passed on the\r\nleft. An ascent was then made of some 35 metres on to a flat-topped\r\nridge, consisting of white and yellow marls and clays, capped by\r\na horizontal bed of hard brown calcareous grit, passing into brown\r\ncrystalline limestone with calcite shell-casts. On this ridge, which\r\nis about 600 metres in width at the place seen, a turn was made so as\r\nto go almost due east. The descent from the ridge on the other side\r\nis on to a plain strewn with whitish-brown laminated and mammilated\r\nlimestone and some limonite, and from the plain rise hills showing\r\nthe same structure as the ridge just crossed. A camel-road running\r\nsouth was crossed 7 kilometres from the starting-point, and beyond\r\nthis, the ground having gradually risen to the level of the brown\r\ncalcareous grit, we came among numerous low hills; these consist\r\nof white chalk beds, capped by sandy greyish limestone and then by\r\nthick beds of harder greyish-white limestone, weathered grey on the\r\nsurface. No fossils were seen here, but continuing the journey east,\r\nover uneven ground of white and greyish limestone of considerable\r\nhardness, a small hill was met with, at about 12 kilometres from the\r\nstarting-point, and found to consist of limestone with _Nummulites_,\r\nand these foraminifera were found in great abundance a little further\r\non. The finding of these forms, so distinctively Eocene, is important\r\nas showing that whatever the age of the limestones at the actual\r\nedge of the south part of the oasis may be, the beds forming the\r\nplateau only a few kilometres east of the oasis are, like those which\r\nform the top of the northern scarp, of undoubted Eocene age. The\r\nnummulites were visible in the rocks of the plateau till about 17\r\nkilometres from the starting-point, none being noticed further on\r\ntill the neighbourhood of the great sand-dunes was reached. At\r\n25 kilometres a slight depression containing numerous hills of\r\nwhite chalk was entered. The floor of this depression, 267 metres\r\nabove sea-level, is strewn with fragments of crystalline calcite,\r\nprobably derived from veins or druses in the chalk. The beds here\r\ndip slightly to the south. About 3 kilometres further on the beds dip\r\nabout 5° E.S.E., so that higher beds were come on; the dip however\r\nsoon diminished. At 29 kilometres the plateau rock consisted of\r\nporous siliceous limestone, generally white, but in places yellow,\r\nclosely resembling that found capping the scarp in the northern\r\nparts of the oasis. The march was continued over white limestones\r\nof varying hardness, with flints and fragments of chalcedony on the\r\nsurface, and numerous low limestone-hills. At 36 kilometres a chalky\r\narea was entered on, covered with countless small rounded hills of\r\nchalky limestone; these hills, of which there are literally millions,\r\ncover the ground like haycocks in a field; they are generally about\r\n20 metres high, and up to 100 metres in diameter. No fossils were\r\nseen in the rocks. At 70 kilometres the hills began to get smaller,\r\nbecoming presently mere chalk-mounds. A slight depression, about a\r\nkilometre wide, with larger chalk hills, was crossed at 73 kilometres,\r\nbeyond which was a long stretch of flat ground composed of snow-white\r\nlimestone, chalky to fairly hard, unfossiliferous, with thin siliceous\r\nbands. At 83 kilometres occasional low limestone hills were seen\r\non ground otherwise fairly level, strewn with flints. A camel-road\r\ngoing south-east was crossed at 77½ kilometres. At 92 kilometres\r\nnumerous small gasteropod casts were noticed in the chalk, but no\r\nother fossils. The plateau further on was seen to be formed of a hard\r\nthin bed of siliceous limestone, with chalk below; it shows occasional\r\ndepressions with low hills within them. At 103 kilometres the great\r\nbelt of sand-dunes running N.W.-S.E. was entered on. Close to the\r\ndunes and in the interspaces between them the plateau-rock is hard\r\nsemi-crystalline white to brownish limestone, with nummulites and\r\nsmall gasteropod-casts. The sand contains a good deal of calcareous\r\nmatter in addition to the grains of quartz. The dunes have a total\r\nwidth of about 3½ kilometres, some of them are of great height, and\r\nthe passage with heavily laden camels is not without some difficulty.\r\n\r\nBeyond the dunes the limestone is frequently siliceous, weathered\r\nsmoky-grey on surface, and crowded with nummulites; the surface of\r\nthe ground is generally sandy and flint-strewn. At 113 kilometres a\r\nnarrow band of highly silicified, superficially blackened, limestone\r\nis crossed. This band, which is only a few centimetres broad,\r\nrunning north and south, stands up like a vein above the plateau,\r\nand is evidently caused by infiltration of siliceous solutions in\r\na crack. In the silicified part of the limestone here the fossils\r\ncan be easily seen; they are chiefly corals. Further on, the plateau\r\nconsists of hard semi-crystalline and horny white limestone in which\r\nfossils are not seen.\r\n\r\nAt 123 kilometres the course, hitherto nearly eastward, was\r\nchanged about 30° to the north, over the same hard semi-crystalline\r\nlimestone, with hillocks showing alternations of soft chalky beds with\r\nharder ones. Some large flat-topped hills passed at 130 kilometres\r\nconsist of horizontal limestone-beds, the lower ones being chalky,\r\nthe upper ones hard, grey, and somewhat porous. Beyond this small\r\nrounded flints are seen on the plain, and these continue, increasing\r\nin number, till a low plateau in front is reached. At 134 kilometres a\r\nbroad camel-road going south-east was crossed, and at 135 kilometres\r\nthe scarp of a higher plateau was ascended. The lower plain has an\r\naltitude of 127 metres above sea-level, the top of the plateau being\r\nsome 70 metres higher; the ground however rises gradually before\r\nreaching the escarpment, so that the actual rise at the scarp is\r\nonly about 40 metres. The beds passed through on the ascent are—\r\n\r\n  _Top._\r\n\r\n          1.  Gravels of rounded flints and pebbles, thin covering.\r\n\r\n          2.  White chalk, 2 metres.\r\n\r\n          3.  Earthy limestone, 60 centimetres.\r\n\r\n          4.  Red and white clays and marls, about 30 metres.\r\n\r\n          5.  Sandy limestone, 20 centimetres.\r\n\r\n          6.  Clayey limestone, 15 centimetres.\r\n\r\n          7.  Sandy limestone, 60 centimetres.\r\n\r\n          8.  Limestone conglomerate, 1 metre.\r\n\r\n          9.  Red and yellow clays at base.\r\n\r\nThese beds appear to dip slightly eastward. No fossils were seen.\r\n\r\nThe top of the plateau is a huge level gravel-plain, with white chalky\r\nlimestone showing through occasionally. Sometimes this rock shows a\r\nloose tufaceous texture; at other places it is sandy and fissile,\r\nand now and again it encloses small pebbles. A broad camel-road\r\ngoing south-east was crossed at 145 kilometres, and another in the\r\nsame direction was crossed at 157 kilometres. At 162 kilometres, the\r\ngravelly ground having gradually fallen to 179 metres above sea-level,\r\na turn so as to take again an eastward course was made, and a long\r\nstretch of gently undulating gravelly ground, with white limestone\r\nshowing through in small patches, was traversed. A camel-road going\r\neast was crossed obliquely at 185 kilometres. At 196 kilometres, low\r\ngravel-covered hills of some extent were passed. The pebbles range\r\nup to 10 or 15 centimetres in diameter, and are well-rounded. In\r\nthe lower part of one of these hills, sandy chalky limestone is seen\r\ncropping out through the gravel which covers the slope. Then a little\r\nfurther on are other low hills of white and grey nummulitic limestone,\r\nonly thinly sprinkled with pebbles and sand. Some of the beds here\r\ncontain cylindrical nearly vertical holes, one being measured and\r\nfound to be 8 centimetres diameter and 45 centimetres deep.\r\n\r\nBeyond the hills just mentioned is a further stretch of gravel, till\r\nat 199 kilometres a broad low ridge of white and creamy limestone,\r\ncrowded with large nummulites (_N. gizehensis_) is reached. The beds\r\nof this ridge dip slightly west. The hollows of the ridge are full\r\nof blown sand. Beyond is a flat depression, the floor of which is\r\nstrewn with small nummulites (_N. curvispira_), and with _Ostrea_\r\nand other shells; then another small nummulitic ridge is crossed,\r\nafter which comes some hard smoky-grey silicified limestone, with\r\nmuch sand on the surface. At 202 kilometres from the starting-point a\r\nslight descent was made from the limestone on to a shelving gravelly\r\ntract with some sand-dunes. Some 4 kilometres further on the wide\r\nbelt of low sand-dunes fringing the cultivated area west of Minia\r\nwas entered. This sandy tract has a width of about 4 kilometres;\r\nit contains some patches of grassy land with pools of water.\r\n\r\nThe village of Nasl Nadiub Lengat, at the edge of the\r\nvalley-cultivation, was reached after covering 212 kilometres from the\r\nsouth point of the oasis, the march having occupied about 60 hours.\r\n\r\nTo summarise the geology of the area crossed in the traverse just\r\ndescribed, it will be clear that although the beds which form the\r\ntop of the scarp at the south end of the oasis are probably of Upper\r\nCretaceous age, yet these beds are overlain by Eocene limestone\r\nwith nummulites at a short distance (about 10 kilometres) east of\r\nthe Baharia-Farafra road. It is probable that the entire stretch of\r\nlimestone-plateau between this point and Minia is Eocene, nummulites\r\nbeing recorded both from near the centre of the tract and from the\r\nedge of the desert near Minia. The softer chalky beds traversed\r\nappear stratigraphically lower than the Nummulite-limestone, and\r\nwould seem to correspond to the chalky-limestones with _Operculina\r\nlibyca_ and _Lucina thebaica_ which occur so constantly near the base\r\nof the Eocene in Kharga Oasis. The gravels, as already remarked in\r\nreferring to the Minia-Baharia road, are of uncertain age, but are\r\ncertainly Post-Eocene. The sand-dune belt crossed near the centre\r\nof the tract is the same as that crossed on the outward journey from\r\nMinia, and extends for a great distance north and south.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baharia-Farafra road.]\r\n\r\nThe road from Baharia to Farafra, traversed by Cailliaud in 1820,[26]\r\nand by Jordan in 1874[27], was taken by a party of the Geological\r\nSurvey in proceeding to Farafra after surveying the west side\r\nof Baharia. The start was made from the same point as the return\r\ntraverse to Minia, viz., the point of ascent of the Farafra road\r\nat the south scarp of Baharia (lat. 27° 48′ 13″ N., long. 28°\r\n32′ 49″ E. of Greenwich), and the general course taken was in a\r\ndirection 30°-40° west of south. A second, almost disused, road\r\nfrom Baharia to Farafra ascends the western escarpment from the\r\ndepression 3½ kilometres further north, follows a narrow plateau\r\nat the base of the chalk escarpment and joins the main road some\r\ndistance south of the extreme end of the oasis-depression.\r\n\r\nThe main road after ascending the scarp at the extreme south end\r\nof the depression, at the point mentioned, proceeds at first in a\r\ndirection about 30° west of south, over a limestone plateau, with\r\nsandstones and clays below. After 4 kilometres hard concretionary\r\ngrey sandstones are noticed, and 3 kilometres further on a small\r\nhill of hard false-bedded grey sandstone is passed. The escarpment\r\nof the White Chalk now approaches within 2 kilometres of the road\r\non the right hand, on the left being slightly further away. These\r\nescarpments run parallel with the road for some 5 kilometres, forming\r\na large bay, until at 12½ kilometres the road passes through a\r\nnarrow pass with the cliffs of white chalk quite close on either\r\nside. Almost immediately the cliffs again recede, forming a small\r\nbay opening into another still larger at 14½ kilometres. At this\r\npoint an isolated chalk stack, with great masses of fibrous calcite\r\nat the base, is passed, and this hill makes a convenient point for a\r\nsurvey-station. Several more isolated hills are now passed and then\r\nthe chalk scarps on either side close up and join, the road passing\r\nup the escarpment at the end of the bay and gaining the summit of the\r\nwhite chalk at 20½ kilometres. The beds forming the plateau between\r\nthe end of the oasis-depression and this escarpment of white chalk\r\nbelong to the middle series of the Upper Cretaceous, the “variegated\r\nclays and sandstones,” fully described in Chapter V.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the white chalk escarpment the road continues in a\r\nwell-maintained direction of about 40° west of south, over a more or\r\nless level gravelly plain with outcrops of hard crystalline limestone\r\nor chalk. Another, less used, road to Farafra, via the bay to the\r\nnorth-east of Ain el Wadi (in Farafra Oasis), probably branches\r\noff about this point. At 35 kilometres a small hill of siliceous\r\nlimestone is passed and the chalk forms a slight escarpment a little\r\nway to the left.\r\n\r\nAbout a kilometre further on a ridge of dark brown ferruginous\r\nsandstone is crossed and almost immediately afterwards, at 49\r\nkilometres, the road descends through snow-white chalk cliffs into\r\nthe depression of Farafra. The chalk forming the cliffs weathers in\r\nplaces to a smoky-black colour. At the bottom of the descent, which\r\nis gentle and presents no difficulties, an isolated hill occurs\r\non the left and from this the dark clump of palms of Ain el Wadi\r\nis plainly visible bearing 9° west of south and distant about 16\r\nkilometres. From Ain el Wadi to Farafra village is another day’s\r\nmarch of 43 kilometres, the road bearing about 35 west of south,\r\nbut for details the reader is referred to the report on Farafra\r\nOasis.[28] With regard to the geology of the road across the plateau\r\nseparating Baharia and Farafra, the age of the beds first passed over\r\nhas already been mentioned. After rising on to the white chalk the\r\nsurface of this formation is followed right up to the descent into\r\nFarafra. Although occasional crystalline limestones are crossed,\r\nthese, with the surface accumulations of flinty material, are only\r\nskin deep and the former probably represents the upper part of the\r\nchalk itself. No Eocene beds were observed, and it is extremely\r\ndoubtful if any exist; in the latter case they would be patches of\r\nOperculina-nummulitic limestone from the base of the Esna Shales,\r\nas this limestone is sometimes left capping the surface of the white\r\nchalk after complete denudation of the shales above, as in the bay\r\nto the north-east of Ain el Wadi. We thus see that the Cretaceous of\r\nBaharia is continuous with that of Farafra and that the intervening\r\ndesert is not formed of the Nummulitic limestones of the Eocene as\r\nformerly supposed and shown on the Rohlfs Expedition map.[29]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Roads.]\r\n\r\nBesides the routes already mentioned, there are several other roads\r\nconnecting Baharia with Siwa Oasis, the Fayum, and the Nile Valley. Of\r\nthe principal of these we have a fairly accurate knowledge from the\r\nrecords of scientific travellers, such as Jordan and Ascherson, and\r\nit may be well to mention briefly the chief points concerning them.\r\n\r\nThe road from Siwa[30] was traversed by Jordan in 1874, the march\r\noccupying ten days. Leaving Siwa (N. lat. 29° 12′ 0″, long. 25°\r\n31′ 0″ E. of Greenwich, altitude 25 metres below sea-level),\r\nthe road follows an east-south-east course for about 80 kilometres;\r\nit then turns slightly more southwards, rounding the corner of the\r\nplateau (Pacho Mt. of Rohlfs) and afterwards passing through the deep\r\ndepressions of Aradj (- 70 m.) and Uttiah (- 20 m.) to the south\r\nside of Lake Sittra (- 25 m., N. lat. 28° 42′ 40″, long. 27°\r\n4′ 23″ E. of Greenwich, 170 kilometres distant from Siwa). From\r\nSittra an easterly course is taken for some 52 kilometres, when\r\nanother slight turn to the south is made, the oasis of Baharia being\r\nentered by descending the scarp some 3 kilometres slightly north of\r\nwest of El Qasr. Between Sittra and the edge of the oasis the ground,\r\nwhich is of nummulitic limestone, rises gradually but steadily,\r\nthe level at the edge of the oasis being 194 metres above sea. The\r\ndistance from Sittra to El Qasr is about 180 kilometres, making the\r\ntotal distance along the route taken from Siwa about 350 kilometres.\r\n\r\nThe road from the Fayum to Baharia, taken by Belzoni in 1819,\r\nPacho in 1823, and Ascherson in 1876, has a total length of about\r\n240 kilometres, and occupies some six days in marching. Leaving\r\nMedinet el Fayum the road proceeds south-west via Gharag to Wadi\r\nRayan (29 m. below sea-level, about 75 kilometres from Medinet el\r\nFayum) where a supply of water is obtainable from several different\r\nsprings. From Ain Rayan the road proceeds south-west over a rising\r\nnummulitic limestone plateau, crossing the so-called Bahr bela\r\nMa a little north of the Maghagha-Baharia road. At “El Bahr”\r\n(100 kilometres from Ain Rayan) a turn is made to the W.S.W.; the\r\nsand-dunes of Abu Moharik are crossed a little further on, and the\r\noasis is entered at the northern extremity by the same “agaba” as\r\nthat taken by the Maghagha road. Within the oasis the road branches\r\nas already described, the west branch leading to El Qasr and the\r\neast one to Zubbo.\r\n\r\nAnother route making use of the same point of entry into the oasis\r\nas that just described is marked on Ascherson’s map as coming from\r\nBahnessa, a large village on the Bahr Yusuf, near the western edge of\r\nthe Nile Valley. This road, which is some 190 kilometres in length,\r\nleads almost due west over a monotonous plateau till near the oasis,\r\nwhere it joins the roads from the Fayum and Maghagha.\r\n\r\nThe road between Baharia and Samalut, traversed on his return journey\r\nby Ascherson in 1876, appears to be the shortest connection between\r\nthe oasis and the Nile Valley. Its course is due west, and its\r\ntotal length to Mandisha about 180 kilometres. Leaving Samalut the\r\ncultivation is crossed via Mangatin to Rubi; this latter village is\r\non the edge of the desert, about 5 kilometres west of Samalut. The\r\nroad proceeds over a monotonous rocky and gravelly plateau, crossing\r\nthe great sand-dune belt of Abu Moharik about 122 kilometres west of\r\nSamalut, and entering the oasis near Ain Gelid by the same descent\r\nas that used by the Survey party from Minia. The journey from Bawitti\r\nto Samalut occupied Ascherson four days.\r\n\r\nStill another road from the Nile Valley, likewise entering the oasis\r\nnear Ain Gelid, is marked on Ascherson’s map as coming from Delga,\r\na village near the west edge of the valley-cultivation. This road has\r\na N.N.W. course, and a total length from Delga to Mandisha of about\r\n190 kilometres. It crosses the sand-dunes of Abu Moharik about 130\r\nkilometres from Delga, _i.e._, about 40 kilometres before reaching\r\nthe edge of the oasis.\r\n\r\nSeveral other roads start from points still further south, such as\r\nDer el Maragh, Beniadi, Assiut, etc., and most of the villages along\r\nthe west side of the Nile Valley between Assiut and the Fayum have\r\nbranch tracks which join the main roads at different points.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: For remarks on the surveying of desert roads, and on\r\nthe possibility of traversing the open desert, see BALL Kharga Oasis\r\n(Reports of the Geolog.

Previously existing\r\nmaps frequently indicate this depression as being open towards the\r\neast, but one of the results of the survey expedition has been to\r\nshow that such a representation is erroneous, Baharia differing from\r\nthe southern oases in being entirely surrounded by an escarpment,\r\nfor the most part steep and difficult of ascent. In plan the oasis is\r\nof highly irregular outline, more particularly on its western side;\r\nbut the general shape of the excavation is that of a large oval, with\r\nits major axis running north-east and south-west, and with a narrow\r\nblunt pointed extension at each end. The extreme length (N.E.-S.W.) is\r\nabout 94 kilometres, and its greatest width, measured at right angles\r\nto its length, some 42 kilometres. The average depth from the general\r\ndesert plateau-level to the floor of the excavation is rather less\r\nthan a hundred metres. Thus, though commonly called the “little\r\noasis” in contradistinction to the still larger areas of Farafra,\r\nKharga and Dakhla, Baharia is of considerable size, covering in all\r\nover 1,800 square kilometres. Within the excavation, and rising up\r\nfrom its floor, in some cases to a greater height than the bounding\r\nscarps, are numerous hills, the larger generally having flat tops and\r\nthe smaller ones being more or less conical. The cultivated lands,\r\nwhich lie almost entirely around the villages in the north part of\r\nthe oasis, bear only a very small ratio to the entire oasis-area,\r\nprobably not exceeding in all, including palm-groves, 11 square\r\nkilometres; the remainder of the floor is, however, by no means\r\nabsolutely waterless or totally devoid of vegetation, as numerous\r\nsprings exist in certain areas, outside the cultivation-limits,\r\nand desert grasses and scrub cover considerable tracts; extensive\r\nsalines, now mostly nearly dried up, are found in some localities.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to consider the topography of the oasis under\r\nthe following principal heads:—\r\n\r\n  1.  The bounding escarpments;\r\n\r\n  2.  The hills within the oasis;\r\n\r\n  3.  The floor of the oasis, including the villages,\r\n      hamlets and springs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.—_The Bounding escarpments._—At the most northerly point of the\r\noasis is a narrow extension some 4½ kilometres wide, enclosing a\r\nlarge black hill, Jebel Horabi. The portion of the scarp, or wall,\r\nwhich bounds this extension is lower and less steep than that\r\nfurther south, as the level of the oasis-floor rises considerably\r\ntowards the hill just mentioned. The roads from Feshn, Maghagha\r\nand the Fayum enter at the north-east point of the extension;\r\nthe descent is easy, the fall from the plateau into the oasis-area\r\nbeing about 70 metres, with a further drop of some 30 metres just\r\nafter passing Jebel Horabi. At this latitude the depression opens\r\nout considerably, the escarpment on the one side trending to the\r\nsouth-west, while that on the other side turns a little east of\r\nsouth; about 8 kilometres further on there is a sudden widening of\r\nthe excavation, the scarps retreating respectively east and west,\r\nso that before the latitude of the villages is reached the oasis has\r\na width of some 28 kilometres. Between the latitude of the villages\r\nand Ain el Haiss a marked difference in the two scarps is noticeable;\r\nboth curve round so as to enclose a wide oval area, but while that on\r\nthe east side shows a comparatively smooth outline, broken only by\r\na few small projecting headlands and gullies, the western bounding\r\nwall displays a highly irregular shape, long irregular tongues of\r\nplateau being separated by wide or narrow “bays.”\r\n\r\nOn the east side, the most considerable irregularity is near Ain\r\nGelid; south-east of this spring the road from Minia enters down a\r\ngently-falling open sandy gully, with a long square-ended tongue of\r\nplateau to the south of it. Further south two other roads, perhaps\r\nbranches of the one just mentioned, enter by smaller gullies; the\r\nscarp here has become much less formidable than further north, and\r\nthe top of the plateau is covered with countless small conical hills\r\nof white chalk. Near the north end of the large hill-mass E.N.E. of\r\nAin el Haiss, the eastern scarp almost disappears, the oasis-floor\r\nhaving risen considerably; it becomes more marked further on, and\r\ncontinues to the south, though of no great height, with limestone\r\nridges at its foot. Just south of the large hill-mass referred to,\r\nthe lower limestone ridges unite so as to form a regular escarpment,\r\nwhich continues southward as the limiting-wall of the oasis, the upper\r\nscarp now forming the edge of a higher plateau about a kilometre\r\naway from the oasis-edge. The two escarpments run almost parallel,\r\none forming a step above the other, to the south end of the oasis; the\r\nlower one, forming the oasis-wall proper, is much more considerable\r\nthan the upper, and the edge of the upper one is frequently broken\r\ninto hills. Small chalk-hills continue to cover the upper plateau.\r\n\r\nFrom Jebel Horabi, at the extreme north end of the depression, the\r\nwestern wall, or escarpment, trends in a general direction of 30°\r\nsouth of west for about 20 kilometres before it turns and runs some 5\r\nkilometres south, forming the prominent headland about 2½ kilometres\r\nnorth-west of El Qasr. This cliff, probably the boldest part of the\r\nwhole oasis-wall, attains a height of some 175 metres above the lowest\r\npart of the floor of the depression. It is steep throughout and the\r\nonly practicable passes to the plateau above are through occasional\r\ngullies, in which the slopes are of easier gradient. The main caravan\r\nroad from El Qasr and Bawitti to Mogara and Alexandria gains the\r\nplateau by the long narrow gully 6½ kilometres N.N.W. of El Qasr. To\r\nthe south of the headland, 2½ kilometres north-west of El Qasr, the\r\nescarpment runs back and forms a remarkable narrow bay, running east\r\nand west, with an average width of only 4 kilometres, and extending\r\nsome 18 kilometres west of El Qasr. This indentation is separated\r\nfrom a much larger opening to the south by a long narrow promontory,\r\nor tongue of plateau, barely a kilometre wide in places. The extreme\r\npoint of this tongue is 9 kilometres south-west of Bawitti.\r\n\r\nThe large bay to the south is bounded on the north by the usual\r\nsteep wall of rock, but this becomes much less prominent at the\r\nwestern extremity, where the escarpment is low and easily accessible\r\nto camels. A few kilometres out to the west is another escarpment of\r\nwhite chalk trending irregularly in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction. An\r\nold road, probably joining the main caravan road from Bawitti to Siwa\r\nfurther west, runs up this bay and on to the plateau beyond. Numerous\r\nlarge and small hills occur within the bay. The southern cliff,\r\nformed of dark brown or black ferruginous sandstones, is remarkably\r\nirregular, and quite different in appearance and weathering from\r\nthe northern wall. The promontory to the south of this bay juts out\r\nboldly into the oasis-area. Further south the escarpment recedes and\r\nruns in the most irregular manner some 25 kilometres south-west,\r\nseveral times retreating to form well-marked indentations in the\r\ngeneral line of cliff; it afterwards trends 15 kilometres south-east\r\nup to the prominent corner 4 kilometres west of Ain el Haiss. A\r\nroad from Ain el Haiss to Siwa reaches the escarpment 15 kilometres\r\nnorth-west of the spring, passing up a gully of easy gradient to\r\nthe plateau. About 7 kilometres further on the chalk escarpment,\r\nalready mentioned, is seen running N.N.E. and S.S.W.\r\n\r\nAbout the latitude of Ain el Haiss the east and west escarpments\r\napproach each other considerably, the width of the depression\r\nnarrowing from some 36 to about 15 kilometres. This narrowing\r\ncontinues, though more gradually, to the southern extremity, where\r\nthe width is only 4 kilometres. The western side, south of Ain el\r\nHaiss, is formed of three separate scarps, one behind the other, the\r\noutermost being that of white chalk which has already been referred\r\nto. On the east a second scarp of less height is found behind the\r\nlower. The height of the main scarp above the oasis floor at the\r\nsouthern end of the oasis is about 80 metres.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme south the main road from Baharia to Farafra ascends\r\nup an easy gradient to the plateau above the lowest escarpment,\r\nthe others being crossed further to the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hills within the Oasis-excavation._—The most striking feature\r\nin the topography of Baharia Oasis is the large number of hills\r\nwithin the area. These hills impede the view, so that from very\r\nfew points on the low ground can any extended outlook be obtained,\r\nand they give to Baharia an appearance entirely different from that\r\nwhich characterises the other Egyptian oases. For the most part these\r\nhills have a black aspect, due to the nature of the rocks (ferruginous\r\nquartzites and dolerite) capping them; a few are reddish (ferruginous\r\nsandstone and ochreous clay); others again are white (limestone).\r\n\r\nThe most strongly-marked group of hills is that extending in a\r\nnearly straight north-easterly direction a few kilometres south\r\nof the villages. Forming a prolongation of the long tongue of the\r\nwest scarp already mentioned, this line of hills almost cuts the\r\noasis in two. The largest hill of the range, Jebel Hefhuf, a narrow,\r\nridge-like hill of limestone, has a black appearance at its northern\r\nend, being here composed of dolerite; the others capped entirely by\r\nbrown limestone and partly swathed in accumulations of blown sand\r\nare of lighter aspect. They rise to a height of some 130 metres\r\nabove the level of the villages.\r\n\r\nThe large, dark, dolerite-capped hill between El Qasr-Bawitti and\r\nZubbo-Mandisha (Jebel Mandisha) divides the two main cultivated\r\ntracts of the oasis from each other, the road from Mandisha to El\r\nQasr passing over its southern end. A similar mass is Jebel Mayesra,\r\nthe large triangular hill north of Jebel Mandisha; the blackness\r\nof Jebel Horabi, in the north end of the oasis, is, on the other\r\nhand, due not to eruptive rocks but to the presence of iron ore in\r\nconsiderable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe huge hill-mass near the east scarp, north of the latitude of Ain\r\nel Haiss, is of blackened sandstone, like most of the hills near it;\r\nsome of those west of it are, however, white, owing to a capping of\r\nlimestone, and these stand out in striking contrast to the others. No\r\npurpose would be served by a detailed description of the smaller\r\nhills; their positions will be evident from the map (Plate I), and\r\nexcept in the case of the larger ones, there is a great monotony of\r\nform, nearly all the smaller hills being conical. One of the most\r\nstriking conical hills is seen near the west scarp in lat. 28°\r\n26′ N. (10 kilometres north-east from El Qasr); this, however,\r\nis a limestone-capped hill, thus differing from the numerous cones\r\nin the south part of the oasis, which are mostly capped by hard dark\r\nferruginous quartzites and sandstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Floor of the Oasis._—The lowest part of the oasis-floor\r\nappears to be in the neighbourhood of El Qasr, where the altitude\r\nabove sea-level is about 113 metres. Mandisha lies somewhat higher,\r\nand the hamlet of Harra, with the springs Ain Gelid and Ain Haswi\r\nlie on a level tract some 134 metres above sea-level. Ain el Haiss,\r\naccording to the Survey’s barometric comparisons with Cairo, has\r\nan altitude of 156 metres above sea; as Jordan’s determination,\r\nhowever, gave only 122 metres, there is some little uncertainty\r\nabout the actual altitude of this point. As might be expected,\r\nthe lowest parts of the oasis-floor are those where springs abound;\r\nin the neighbourhood of the hills and escarpments there is always a\r\ngradual upward slope towards the bases of the hills and plateau. The\r\nmajor part of the oasis-floor is flat or gently undulating ground\r\nof sandstones and clays, strewn with fragments of rock derived from\r\nthe hills; large areas, however, are overgrown with grasses and\r\nscattered bushes, notably to the north and west of the villages,\r\nin the neighbourhood of Ain Gelid, south-east of Jebel Hefhuf,\r\nand in the vicinity of Ain el Haiss; while other extensive tracts\r\nnorth of the villages, as well as south-east of Mandisha and between\r\nHarra and Ain Gelid, are covered by salty marshes, now partly dried\r\nup. The white salty crusts on the ground at these places give them\r\na striking appearance, like a slightly rough glittering sheet of\r\nwater. The tracts north of Zubbo and near Harra still contain much\r\nwater and salty sludge; travelling over them needs great caution,\r\nas the dry crust will often support the weight of a man, while a\r\ncamel sinks through into the soft mire beneath. Sand-accumulations\r\ndo not cover such large tracts in Baharia as in the southern oases;\r\nthere are, however, some small dunes around the cultivated lands of\r\nMandisha and Zubbo, as well as on some of the hill-sides; the dunes\r\nsupport a scanty growth of tamarisk-bushes.\r\n\r\nThe principal villages of Baharia are four in number, all situated\r\nnear together in the north part of the oasis in N. lat. 28° 21′\r\nto 28° 22′. They are separated into two groups by a large hill\r\n(Jebel Mandisha), El Qasr and Bawitti lying to the west, and Mandisha\r\nand Zubbo to the east. The Government officials reside at Bawitti\r\nand El Qasr. According to the last census,[31] the population of the\r\noasis in 1897 was 6,081 divided among the four villages as follows:—\r\n\r\n  El Qasr      1.712\r\n\r\n  Bawitti      1.713\r\n\r\n  Mandisha     1.798\r\n\r\n  Zubbo          858[32]\r\n\r\nThe males slightly outnumber the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nThe villages are small uninteresting collections of mud hovels,\r\nsurrounded by gardens, palm-groves, and cultivated lands. Besides\r\nthe cultivated tracts existing close around the villages, there\r\nare others at points more or less distant from them, tilled by men\r\nfrom the villages. Such are seen, for instance, west of Zubbo;\r\nat Ain Bayum, a spring with a small cultivated area, among the\r\nsand-dunes 4½ kilometres north-east of Zubbo, where a clump of\r\ndate-palms forms a conspicuous landmark; Ain Sini and Ain Murun,\r\n7 kilometres north-east of El Qasr; also some small tracts west of,\r\nand a large area south-west of, Bawitti. Ain Auena, El Ayun, and other\r\npoints marked on Ascherson’s map, are probably within this last\r\narea. Taking the whole cultivated land, inclusive of palm-groves,\r\nat 11 sq. kilometres, the area per individual of population works\r\nout to about 0·43 feddans; this figure is somewhat lower than\r\nKharga (0·56 feddan) and considerably less than that of Dakhla\r\n(1·49). While Kharga exports practically nothing, Baharia does a\r\nconsiderable export trade with the Nile Valley, principally in dates,\r\nalthough not on so large a scale as Dakhla.\r\n\r\nIn and near the villages springs are extremely numerous; the water\r\nis met with at shallow depths, and does not require, as in Kharga and\r\nDakhla, deep-bored wells. It is led from its sources along underground\r\naqueducts, which date from the Roman occupation; a description of\r\nthese will be found in the chapter on antiquities (p. 73-80). No\r\nattempt was made by the survey to map or number the wells and springs\r\nwithin the vicinity of the villages; they are mostly concealed in\r\nthe palm-groves and gardens. The water is slightly ferruginous,\r\nand frequently warm, bubbles of carbon dioxide rising with it. At\r\nBawitti, the largest spring is cold, but one close by it is warm,\r\nalthough none approach the high temperature of the Dakhla wells. One\r\nof the principal sources of water in Mandisha, is a well, situated\r\nnear the cemetery, 7 metres deep and timbered with palm trunks;\r\nthe temperature of the water is 26° C. (air 12° C.), and when\r\nfreshly drawn it is turbid with bubbles of carbon dioxide.[33]\r\n\r\nThe process of cleaning out wells and boring fresh ones in Baharia is\r\ndone with a very simple apparatus, an iron jumper about 1½ metres in\r\nlength, 5 centimetres diameter, worked by a rope passing through an\r\neye at one end, being the only boring-tool used. Cleaning out wells\r\nis carried on by this tool in conjunction with the “fass” (a\r\nsort of blunt adze used universally for digging operations in Egypt)\r\nand a rude basket-apparatus for the removal of sand and sludge. The\r\nupper part of the hole having been excavated by the “fass,” the\r\njumper is worked by hand, no tripod or other frame being erected;\r\nthe sludge is raised by a small basket of plaited grass, fitted on\r\nto the lower end of the jumper, lowered into the hole by a rope,\r\nthe sand settling in the basket after jumping the iron tool, with\r\nthe basket attached, within the well. The hole is generally made\r\n75 centimetres diameter, and sinking is said to go on at the rate\r\nof ⅓ metre per hour, ten men being employed, who relieve each\r\nother. It does not appear, however, that this apparatus is capable\r\nof sinking new wells, being only used for cleaning out old ones;\r\nmost of the water used is derived from ancient Roman adits.\r\n\r\nThe water from a single spring often supplies several land-owners;\r\nthe usual method of distribution is by means of a wooden weir, in\r\nthe upper edge of which rectangular notches are cut, each individual\r\nbeing entitled to the water which flows through a certain number of\r\nnotches. As a rule, the springs are banked up at night, so that the\r\nwater accumulates in a large pool near, and is allowed to run on to\r\nthe fields in the daytime.\r\n\r\nTaxation in Baharia and Farafra is based on the land cultivated and\r\nnot, as in Kharga and Dakhla, on the water. Date-palms, are taxed\r\n15 milliemes per annum. The numbers of trees at the 1897 assessment\r\nwere, apricots, 4,863; olives, 5,370; palms, 93,000, or about fifteen\r\nof the latter per inhabitant.[34] The great article of produce in\r\nthe oasis is therefore dates, and at the date-gathering season the\r\ninhabitants are busily employed in gathering, drying and packing the\r\nfruit for export to the Nile Valley. Three-fourths of the whole date\r\nproduction are exported. The dates are of excellent quality, and find\r\na ready sale, the villages of the oasis being crowded with camels and\r\ntraders from the valley each November. A camel-load of dates, packed\r\nin two plaited-grass bags, is bought in the oasis for 500 milliemes,\r\nand is said to be sold in the Nile Valley for four times that sum,\r\nso that the Beduin, to whom the trading is almost wholly confined,\r\neven allowing for difficulties of transport, make a good profit.\r\n\r\nThough dates are the only fruit exported, olives, apricots, grapes,\r\npomegranates, oranges, lemons, and figs are grown in great numbers,\r\nand about 600 feddans are cultivated with rice, wheat and barley\r\ncrops. Clover is sown after the rice crop is gathered. The area of\r\nland cultivated for cereals is said to be slowly diminishing year by\r\nyear, having been 900 feddans fifteen years ago; the decrease is put\r\ndown to a diminished yield from the springs, owing to their becoming\r\nsanded and choked up, but for this the inhabitants are themselves\r\nlargely to blame, as they do not take sufficient measures to keep the\r\nwells free. It may be that water has been diverted to the palm-groves,\r\nthese furnishing the saleable article. It will be apparent, from the\r\nfigures already given, that palm-groves cover the greater portion\r\nof the irrigated land around the villages.\r\n\r\nThe public health of the oasis is far from good. Though free from the\r\nopthalmia which is so prevalent in the Nile Valley, the inhabitants\r\nsuffer much from fevers and gastric disorders, and according to the\r\nGovernment doctor virulent epidemics of small-pox occasionally visit\r\nthe place. The low standard of health is partly attributable to the\r\nbad quality of the water, but is probably highly aggravated by the\r\nswampy ground found in many localities. It is also noticeable that\r\nno trouble is taken to protect the drinking-water from contamination.\r\n\r\nBesides the four principal villages already mentioned, small\r\nsettlements exist at Mandisha Aguza, 2 kilometres east by south from\r\nMandisha; at Harra, a tiny hamlet 14 kilometres east of Mandisha;\r\nat Ain Jafarra, 6 kilometres south of Mandisha; and at Ain el Haiss,\r\nin the south part of the oasis. The populations, etc., of these\r\noutlying settlements are included in the figures given above for\r\nthe chief villages.\r\n\r\nMandisha Aguza consists of a group of mud dwellings aggregated\r\nround a low sandstone eminence, surrounded by a small cultivated\r\ntract. Ascherson records that in 1876 the inhabitants still spoke\r\nthe Siwa dialect among themselves. Cailliaud had already remarked in\r\n1820 that the spot was peopled by colonists from Siwa. Harra consists\r\nof about half a dozen hovels, sheltering a population which cannot\r\nexceed fifty, with several springs and palm-groves, and a small\r\ntract of cultivated land. The principal spring is marked by a large\r\npool of clear water, about 40 metres in diameter, lying in a slight\r\ndepression to the south of the houses; the water has a temperature\r\nof 24° C. (hotter than the air). There is plenty of water at this\r\nplace, and more can easily be got by digging to a small depth.\r\n\r\nAt Ain Jafarra there is only one house, tenanted by a single\r\nfamily. At least two springs exist here, one being near the house\r\nand the other at a distance of some 700 metres to the east; the\r\nwater from the latter spring is led by a long canal to the small\r\npalm-grove and patch of cultivated land near the house. The water,\r\nthough somewhat saline, is drinkable.\r\n\r\nAin el Haiss is an important point on the road from the villages of\r\nBaharia to Farafra. It lies some 40 kilometres S.S.W. from Bawitti,\r\nin about lat. 28° 2′ N., long. 28° 39′ E. of G. It is a small\r\nsettlement, being tenanted at the time of survey by only three or four\r\nmen. There are two springs, one at a higher level than the other. The\r\nupper spring is close to the house occupied by the inhabitants;\r\nthe water, which has a temperature of 15°.6 C. (_i.e._ 3° warmer\r\nthan the air at the time of measurement) is collected into a shallow\r\nmuddy pool, surrounded by a mud dam, whence it flows westward on\r\nto the fields. The lower spring forms a pool of about 400 square\r\nmetres in extent, the temperature of the water here being 14° C. It\r\nis situated about 400 metres south-west of the one just described,\r\nand like it serves for irrigation. Rice was the crop growing at\r\nthe time of our visit. The total irrigated area at Ain el Haiss is\r\nabout 60 or 70 feddans, and there are only a few palms. Besides the\r\nhouse there is a sheikhs’ tomb, which is an object of veneration\r\nin the oasis, a small walled-in garden, and a large ruin; the last\r\nnamed will be described among the antiquities of the oasis. Another\r\nsmall cultivated tract, some 15 or 20 feddans in extent, with at\r\nleast one spring, exists about 3 kilometres north-west of Ain el\r\nHaiss. According to Jordan there are two springs here, named Ain\r\nHassab and Ain el Gharb, owned in 1874 by the Kadi of El Qasr,\r\nbut the place is usually spoken of as Ain el Haiss el Bahari.\r\n\r\nEast of Ain el Haiss are two considerable patches of cultivated\r\nland which were mapped from the east scarp, and thus not examined\r\nby the survey. Of these, the most northerly one is situated about 9\r\nkilometres east of Ain el Haiss; according to Ascherson it bears the\r\nname of Tablemun, and its principal spring had a temperature of 27°\r\nC. The ruins of a Coptic village existing here show that the place\r\nwas inhabited in early times. It lies some 5 kilometres S.S.W. from\r\nTablemun, and about 7 kilometres E.S.E. from Ain el Haiss, and thus\r\nforms the most southerly cultivated spot in the oasis. Both these\r\nlocalities were reported by our men, sent there to obtain water,\r\nto be untenanted; the lands are doubtless cultivated by men sent\r\nfrom Ain el Haiss or from the villages for the purpose. A long line\r\nof sand-dunes and scrub runs S.S.W., hiding these places from a\r\ntraveller approaching from Ain el Haiss.\r\n\r\nBesides the springs at the inhabited spots above described, and\r\nthose used for irrigated lands more or less near to them, there are\r\nnumerous outlying springs, which, while not serving for irrigation,\r\nare important as localities where water may be obtained. The chief\r\nof these are Ain Gelid, on the road from Minia and Samalut, 3½\r\nkilometres south-east of Harra; Ain Haswi, 9½ kilometres due south\r\nof Harra, to which two roads from the east scarp converge; Ain Beled,\r\n7 kilometres west of Bawitti; and Ain Khaman, half-way between Ain el\r\nHaiss and the south point of the oasis. The water at Ain Khaman is\r\nsaid to be bitter and the spring is apparently frequently sanded-up\r\nand difficult to find, so that travellers to Farafra should take in\r\ntheir supplies at Ain el Haiss.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Recensement général de l’Égypte_, tome III, 1896.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Includes about 50 inhabitants of the hamlet of Harra.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: A bottle of the water tightly corked burst shortly\r\nafterwards by gaseous pressure; the bottle having been filled at\r\nthe bottom of the well doubtless accounts for this, the pressure\r\ndue to the head having caused solution of the gas to a greater\r\nextent than could be supported at the surface. The evolved gas was\r\nat first suspected to be methane, as there is frequently a great\r\ndeal of decaying vegetable matter in the mouths of the wells; but\r\nit extinguished a taper, and, moreover, the water runs too rapidly\r\nfor any accumulation of gaseous decomposition-products to take place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: In Dakhla and Kharga Oases there are only seven and\r\na half and eight trees respectively per inhabitant.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n                         GEOLOGY OF THE OASIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Previous geological work.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest geological observations made in Baharia Oasis appear to\r\nhave been those of Cailliaud,[35] who visited the district in 1820,\r\nand recorded the occurrence of volcanic rocks within the depression.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the celebrated Rohlfs Expedition was organised, and in\r\nthat and the succeeding year traversed large portions of the Libyan\r\nDesert. The work of this Expedition, forms indeed, the basis of our\r\nknowledge of the geology of Egypt generally. The eminent geologist\r\nand palæontologist of that Expedition, Karl A. Zittel, did not,\r\nhowever, visit Baharia, and the only information with regard to\r\nthe geology of this oasis was derived from specimens collected by\r\nProf. Ascherson. After examining these, Zittel stated[36] that the\r\nfloor of the oasis consisted of sandstones, marls, etc., presenting a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the lower part of the Overwegi stage;[37]\r\nbut concluded, that as they were succeeded at a very short interval\r\nby Nummulitic Limestone, precluding the possibility of the higher\r\nCretaceous beds, except in a very attenuated form, they must be of\r\nTertiary age.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, Capt. H. G. Lyons, R.E.,[38] visited Baharia, and 5 miles\r\nN.N.E. of Zubbo discovered a bed containing small examples of\r\n_Exogyra_. These were examined by Prof. Zittel and referred to as\r\nundersized specimens of _Exogyra Overwegi_ Beyr.[39] This discovery\r\nof Capt. Lyons’ thus showed the series to be undoubtedly of Upper\r\nCretaceous age.\r\n\r\nIn the latest edition of Prof. Zittel’s map, the depression was\r\nshown as consisting of Cretaceous beds surrounded by an Eocene\r\nplateau, which was also supposed to separate it from the oasis of\r\nFarafra to the south.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geological Survey, Oct.-Dec. 1897.]\r\n\r\nA glance at Plate I will be sufficient to show that the work of the\r\nGeological Survey has resulted in large and important additions to our\r\nknowledge of this oasis. The Eocene is seen to form the surrounding\r\nplateau only on the north; while the Cretaceous, consisting of several\r\nwell-marked divisions, occupies not only the depression itself, but\r\nforms part of the surrounding plateaux on the east and west sides,\r\nand is continuous with that of Farafra to the south. Moreover, the\r\nrelations of the two great formations of Cretaceous and Eocene are\r\nnow shown to be those of unconformability and overlap. The actual\r\nextent of volcanic rocks and post-Eocene lacustrine deposits, the\r\nlatter a newly-discovered and important series, is now shown for\r\nthe first time.[40] Important folding has been detected and numerous\r\norganic remains have been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe deposits met with in the district admit of classification as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n                                RECENT.\r\n\r\n                    1.

They\r\nare best developed and exposed in the north end, where their maximum\r\nthickness is about 170 metres; the base of the series is not seen,\r\nand thus their total thickness cannot be estimated. In the north\r\npart of the oasis they are capped, with apparent conformability, by\r\nEocene limestones, although an intervening band of limestone-grit\r\nmay occasionally occur. In the south, the series is followed by\r\nthe higher Cretaceous divisions, while in the isolated hills within\r\nthe depression these beds are capped either by Eocene limestones,\r\nby basalt or dolerite, or by Post-Eocene ferruginous sandstones\r\nand quartzites.\r\n\r\nThey consist of friable false-bedded variegated sands and sandstones,\r\nwith harder dark-brown ferruginous bands, alternating with sandy\r\nshales and clays, passing through every gradation. Some of the\r\nsandstones are micaceous.\r\n\r\nThe clays are frequently saliferous, and bands of fibrous gypsum\r\nare occasionally seen.\r\n\r\nLarge well-formed groups of barytes crystals are occasionally found\r\nin the sandstones of the oasis-floor, and hard thin vein-like masses\r\nof a sandstone, in which the cementing material is barytes, are\r\nfrequently met with in the eastern part. The weathering of these\r\nveins, which are evidently produced by the action of infiltrated\r\nsolutions in cracks, gives rise to the peculiar spheroidal belted\r\nnodules which often strew the ground, and of which the existence\r\nhas been already mentioned by Ascherson and Zittel.\r\n\r\nAlthough these strata are, as a rule, unfossiliferous, organic\r\nremains are common in certain beds, and especially in the dark-brown\r\nferruginous concretionary bands of the sandstones. The commonest\r\nform is _Exogyra_, individuals of which are found crowded together\r\nin some bands; in most cases they are pseudomorphs in ironstone.\r\n\r\nIn the hills between Mandisha and El Bawitti this series consists of\r\nsoft false-bedded variegated sands and sandstones with ferruginous\r\nbands, alternating with sandy shales, the whole locally showing a\r\nslight westerly dip of between 3° and 7°. Some of the sandstones\r\ncontain flakes of colourless mica. The whole series is capped and\r\nprotected by a hard bed of dolerite, which has been intruded along\r\na bedding plane into the series, and now forms the summit of these\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThe following section was measured about 4 kilometres west of\r\nMandisha—\r\n\r\n  _Top._                                                         Metres.\r\n\r\n         More or less columnar dolerite, much broken up\r\n         by weathering.                                            10\r\n\r\n         Sandstones, sandy clays; unfossiliferous                  65\r\n\r\n         Ferruginous sandstone with casts of _Exogyra_;\r\n         sandrock and sandstone, with ferruginous\r\n         unfossiliferous bands                                     10\r\n\r\nThe section is much obscured by downwash and talus of angular\r\nfragments of dolerite, sand, shale, etc. This downwash of shale and\r\nclay is often covered by a hard coating of salt and sand cemented\r\ntogether, sometimes having the appearance of regular beds.\r\n\r\nThe following is a detailed section measured at the well-marked\r\nisolated conical hill near the western escarpment, 10 kilometres\r\nnorth-east of El Qasr (See Plate I.)

The cliffs\r\nare capped by Eocene limestone-grits and limestone as in the section\r\njust described. The upper part of Jebel Horabi, however, consists of\r\na mass of ironstone, often coarsely pisolitic, with some limonite,\r\nand red and yellow ochre. This iron-ore appears to replace the sandy\r\nbeds more or less irregularly at the base, but the great mass of\r\nmineral above is probably a later and quite distinct deposit. (_Vide_\r\nunder Post-Eocene). Traces of shells occur in places.\r\n\r\nIn the isolated, limestone-capped hill (Plate I), 6½ kilometres\r\nnorth-west of Ain el Haiss (the northern spring) these beds are more\r\nfossiliferous than usual.\r\n\r\n  _Top._  (Limestone, the basal bed of the intermediate series).\r\n\r\n          Limestone, the basal bed of the intermediate series.\r\n\r\n          Sandy beds with hard brown ferruginous concretionary   }\r\n          bands, containing numerous casts of _Cyprimeria_       }\r\n          (_Artemis?_) _Arca_, _Cucullæa_, _Odostomopsis         }\r\n          abeitrensis_, _Baculites_ aff. _syriacus_, and         }\r\n          _Neolobites Vibrayeanus_                               }\r\n                                                                 } 50 m.\r\n          Clays, often shaly                                     }\r\n                                                                 }\r\n          Hard ferruginous sandstone with pockets of             }\r\n          clean white sand                                       }\r\n\r\nNumerous other sections at different points were examined and\r\nmeasured. Such a series is naturally very variable, and individual\r\nbeds do not maintain their characters over wide limits, so that\r\ncorrelation of different sections is not possible, except in the\r\nroughest manner.\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of the depression fossils are more frequent,\r\notherwise the beds are very similar.\r\n\r\nThe series under consideration is by no means poor in organic remains,\r\nalthough the latter are more or less restricted to certain bands\r\nand localities. No doubt most of the fossil shells have been removed\r\nby solution, etc., as those now existing are generally preserved as\r\npseudomorphs in limonite.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of fossils which have been obtained from\r\nthis series:—[42]\r\n\r\n  _Cucullæa_ sp.            |  _Odostomopsis abeitrensis_.\r\n                            |\r\n  _Arca_ sp.                |  _Natica_ sp.\r\n                            |\r\n  _Exogyra flabellata_.     |  _Baculites_ (_syriacus?_)\r\n                            |\r\n  _E. mermeti._             |  _Neolobites vibrayeanus_.\r\n                            |\r\n  _Venus_ (_Artemis?_) sp.  |  Fish-teeth and bones.\r\n\r\n  Silicified wood and plant-remains (including leaves of Dicotyledons).\r\n\r\nAs regards the age of these beds, it has already been mentioned\r\nthat the discovery of _Exogyra_ by Capt. Lyons some years ago, in\r\nthe basal bands of the series, showed them at least to be Cretaceous,\r\nalthough their correlation with the Overwegi stage, on the supposition\r\nthat the specimens collected were referable to _E. Overwegi_, is now\r\nshown to be inadmissible. The fairly extensive assemblage of organic\r\nremains obtained from this and the overlying series enables the age\r\nof the beds to be determined with accuracy, and Dr. Blanckenhorn,\r\nwho had the first opportunity of making a careful examination of\r\nthe collection, has pronounced them to be Cenomanian.[43]\r\n\r\nThe general lithological character of the beds and the prevalence\r\nof false-bedded sandstones containing in places silicified wood\r\nand plant-remains, including leaves of large trees, point to the\r\nconclusion that the beds of this series were deposited in fairly\r\nshallow water, perhaps in an estuary, at no great distance from\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.—_Limestones and Variegated Sandstones._—In the walls of\r\nthe south end of the oasis, the series just described is always\r\noverlain by a bed of hard, and usually more or less crystalline,\r\nlimestone. This limestone forms the lowest member of the series\r\nnow under discussion. At the extreme southern end of the oasis,\r\non the western side, this basal limestone forms a narrow platform,\r\nof only some 200 metres width, separating the respective escarpments\r\nof the two series 6 and 7. On the same side further north the upper\r\nescarpment is usually further back, and in some localities the beds\r\ndo not form a single well-marked escarpment at all.\r\n\r\nThe series also occurs forming a line of hills within the depression,\r\nthese hills owing their existence to a remarkable syncline, by which\r\nthe beds in question have been folded down to the level of the floor\r\nof the depression.\r\n\r\nThe beds of the series form, as a rule, a well-marked group,\r\nindividual beds often being traceable for great distances and\r\ncorrelable in different parts of the oasis.\r\n\r\nThe group as a whole consists of alternations of brown limestone[44]\r\n(with grey crystalline varieties) and variegated sandstones and\r\nclayey beds. A typical section, as exposed on the west scarp in\r\nN. lat. 27° 53′, is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._   (Buff-coloured limestone and white chalk of           Metres.\r\n           Division 5.)\r\n\r\n            1.

They here consist of a considerable thickness of crystalline\r\nlimestone, calcareous grits, shaly clays and sandstones; the softer\r\nbeds always form a gully between the harder.\r\n\r\nThe following were noticed at a point about 7 kilometres from the\r\nwestern end of the ridge:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._                                                         Metres.\r\n\r\n           Calcareous grit, usually siliceous, with bones      }\r\n           (often a true bone-bed).                            }\r\n                                                               }\r\n           Sandy clays, etc., with silicified wood[45]         }\r\n                                                               }\r\n           Thick-bedded brown sandstone, siliceous and         }    21\r\n           ferruginous in part.                                }\r\n                                                               }\r\n           Green and gray iron-stained sandy clays             }\r\n                                                               }\r\n           Thick-bedded brown crystalline limestone            }\r\n\r\n           Brown crystalline limestone with calcite cavities\r\n           near base                                                24\r\n                                                                    --\r\n  _Base._                                                           45\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow come the clays and sandstones of the lowest series, No. 7.\r\n\r\nIn the section above, the limestones are usually too crystalline to\r\nshow any traces of organic remains, although numerous casts of shells\r\noccur at certain points. The calcareous grit, a very well-marked\r\nbed, has been observed at points widely distant within the oasis;\r\nin places it is a true bone-bed,[46] often highly siliceous and\r\npassing into a hard quartzite. Its occurrence here, at the top of\r\nthe Cenomanian series and below the White Chalk (to be described\r\nlater) is of great interest, as its position shows it to be probably\r\nhomotaxial with the bone-beds of Dakhla Oasis[47] and the Eastern\r\nDesert,[48] where they are of Campanian age. The bone-beds on this\r\nhorizon must thus have been deposited over an enormous area.\r\n\r\nIf followed round from the south end of the oasis along the east\r\nscarp, the beds of this division are found to gradually become\r\nmore and more calcareous, consisting often almost entirely of\r\nlimestone,[49] and to dip more and more to the south-east, till in the\r\nneighbourhood of the large sandstone-hill near the scarp in latitude\r\n28° 5′, where the tilting reaches its maximum, they dip at 45°\r\nand partly disappear under the sandy covering of the ground between\r\nthe hill and the scarp. Further north the dip grows less and the\r\nbeds re-appear, forming the top of the main scarp at the oasis-edge.\r\n\r\nThe organic remains in Division 6 include ammonites, echinids,\r\nwith _Ostrea_, _Exogyra_ and masses of _Serpulæ_; fossil wood\r\nand fragments of bone also occur. These fossils are in places\r\nabundant, some bands being almost entirely formed of the shells of\r\n_Exogyra_. The ammonites, although apparently specifically identical\r\nwith those of the lower series, attain a much greater size. The\r\nassemblage of forms and the prevalence of bands of limestone point\r\nto deeper water conditions than the foregoing underlying series.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of forms obtained as far as determined:—\r\n\r\n                  _Rhabdocidaris_, probably nov. sp.\r\n\r\n                  _Diplopodia marticensis_.\r\n\r\n                  _Heterodiadema libycum_.\r\n\r\n                  _Toxaster radula_.\r\n\r\n                  _Hemiaster lusitanicus_ (_roachensis?_)\r\n\r\n                  _Serpula_ (_Galeolaria_) _filiformis_.\r\n\r\n    _Pinna_, probably nov. sp. |    _Corbula_ sp.\r\n                               |\r\n  **_Inoceramus cripsi_.       |  **_Natica_ sp.\r\n                               |\r\n    _Ostrea_ sp.               |    _Tylostoma syriaca_.\r\n                               |\r\n    _Exogyra flabellata_.      |    _Turritella_ nov. sp. aff. _nodosa_.\r\n                               |\r\n    _E. olisiponensis_.        |  **_Turritella_ sp.\r\n                               |\r\n    _E. mermeti_.              |    _Cerithium_ sp.\r\n                               |\r\n    _Plicatula Reynesi_.       |    _Pterodonta_ aff. _inflata_.\r\n                               |\r\n    _Spondylus_ (?)            |    _Murex_.\r\n                               |\r\n    _Modiola_ sp.              |  **_Fusus_ sp.\r\n                               |\r\n    _Cardium_ sp.              |  **_Drillia pleurotomoides_.\r\n                               |\r\n    _Isocardia_ sp.            |\r\n\r\n                  _Nautilus Munieri_.\r\n\r\n                **_Pachydiscus peramplus_.\r\n\r\n                  _Neolobites vibrayeanus_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote **: Indicative of a somewhat later age than Cenomanian.]\r\n\r\nThe above fauna taken as a whole has a decided Cenomanian aspect,\r\nalthough some of the forms (marked **) are indicative of a somewhat\r\nlater age, i.e., Turonian and Senonian. As the next bed above is\r\nthe Danian White Chalk, it is probable that some of the upper beds\r\nof this series form a transitional stage between the Cenomanian and\r\nDanian. The presence of the bone-bed, as already mentioned probably\r\nof the same age as the Dakhla and Eastern Desert bone-beds, i.e.,\r\nCampanian, supports this view. In any case, however, the great\r\nthickness of beds, of Senonian-Danian age, of the southern oases of\r\nDakhla and Kharga, including the bone-beds, the _Exogyra Overwegi_\r\nseries and the ash-gray shales, is here apparently only represented\r\nby a few metres of deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DANIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Thick-bedded White Chalk and grey crystalline limestone._—This\r\nseries conformably overlies the upper member of the last. On the\r\nwest side the chalk forms a well-marked, snow-white, tortuous\r\nescarpment, lying at a considerable distance (5 to 10 kilometres)\r\nfrom the oasis-wall. Towards the south, however, it approaches the\r\ndepression, its escarpment following immediately above and behind that\r\nof the underlying series. South of the extreme end of the depression\r\nproper, the chalk escarpment forms a long narrow bay, the furthest\r\npoint of which is 20 kilometres distant. Thence it runs northwards,\r\nso that to the south-east of the depression the beds of the series are\r\nseen at some little distance from the oasis-edge, but further north\r\nthey appear to come to the edge and to overlie the brown limestone\r\nas part of the main scarp in the neighbourhood of the large hill\r\nalready mentioned in latitude 28° 5′ N., where the strata dip so\r\nsteeply into the plateau. There is some difficulty in correlating the\r\nbeds of this group on the two sides of the oasis, for while on the\r\nwest they are chalky and in places fossiliferous, being only in part\r\naltered to a crystalline limestone, on the east, doubtless owing to\r\nthe folding which produced the strong dipping already referred to,\r\nthey are almost entirely composed of hard crystalline and horny\r\ngreyish-white limestone, apparently devoid of fossils. (_Vide_ p. 60).\r\n\r\nWithin the depression it is probable that the White Chalk is\r\nrepresented in part by some of the hard gray crystalline limestone\r\nin the synclinal fold of Jebel Hefhuf.\r\n\r\nOn the west and south-west sides of the depression the White Chalk\r\ncovers a considerable area, which is characterized by its rough\r\nsurface and by numerous depressions, some of considerable size,\r\neroded by wind-borne sand. To the south it extends to Farafra,\r\nbeing continuous with the chalk of that oasis.\r\n\r\nLithologically, on the west side of the oasis, the series is\r\nrepresented by a thick-bedded, snow-white, pure foraminiferal chalk,\r\n30 to 45 metres thick, partly altered in the upper part into hard\r\ngray crystalline limestone. It was probably deposited in water of\r\nconsiderable depth.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the depression the White Chalk yielded a fair\r\nassemblage of fossil-remains, the chief among which were great numbers\r\nof corals. In the upper part Nautili are occasionally met with,\r\nwhile _Spirorbis_, _Pecten_, _Gryphæa_, fragments of _Inoceramus_\r\nand other shells are fairly common. In addition echinids occur\r\nsparingly and sharks’ teeth are seen here and there. One of the\r\nbest fossil localities is 24 kilometres north of Ain el Haiss.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of those obtained:—\r\n\r\n  _Cælosmilia_.          |  _Exogyra overwegi_.\r\n                         |\r\n  _Linthia_ nov. sp.     |  _Pecten farafrensis_.\r\n                         |\r\n  _Spirorbis_.           |  _Spondylus_ nov. sp. aff. _S. Dutempleanus_.\r\n                         |\r\n  _Inoceramus_.          |  _Nautilus_ sp.\r\n                         |\r\n  _Gryphæa vesicularis_  |  _Corax pristodontus_.\r\n\r\nAs regards the age of this White Chalk the fossil facies has a very\r\nyoung Cretaceous aspect. Zittel[50] has already shown that the White\r\nChalk of the Libyan Desert, studied by him in Farafra, Dakhla and\r\nKharga, is Danian, and the identity of the chalk of Baharia with\r\nthat of those oases was satisfactorily proved on the traverse from\r\nthe latter oasis to Farafra.\r\n\r\nThe White Chalk brings our description of the Cretaceous series of\r\nBaharia to a close. As will be shown, it is overlain unconformably by\r\nEocene deposits. Throughout the deposition of the Cretaceous in this\r\narea it is clear from the character of the beds that the sea-floor\r\nhad been continually sinking. After the deposition of the white chalk\r\nsubsidence probably ceased and the area became one of elevation,\r\nthe Cretaceous beds rising to form land. During this elevation much\r\nfolding must have taken place, and subsequently gradual subsidence\r\nset in until in Lower Eocene times the area again became marine and\r\nthe deposition of the rocks now to be described began to take place.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EOCENE.\r\n\r\n                   UPPER LIBYAN—LOWER MOKATTAM.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Limestones with Nummulites and Operculina_.—In the north part\r\nof the oasis, both in the walls and in the isolated hills within\r\nthe depression, the lower Cenomanian beds, the “Sandstones, clays\r\nand marls,” are directly overlain by buff-coloured or yellowish\r\nlimestone of Eocene age, containing _Nummulites_, _Operculina_,\r\n_Ostrea_, etc. The beds of the two series being horizontal, the\r\njunction is one of apparent conformability, but in many localities the\r\nbase of the Eocene is marked by a bed of limestone-grit, indicating\r\nthe break in continuity of deposition which is known to have occurred\r\nfrom the respective ages of the beds in question and from a study\r\nof the same beds further to the south.\r\n\r\nIn a traverse across the plateau to the west of Bawitti,\r\nOperculina-limestones with nummulites were found to form the surface\r\nof the desert. Again on the traverse from Maghagha to the oasis,\r\nalready described, no Cretaceous beds were crossed, so that the\r\nplateau N.N.E. and N.W. of the northern end of the oasis is entirely\r\nformed of Eocene rocks. On the east side, however, no certain evidence\r\nof Eocene age in the beds capping the scarp has been found south\r\nof the fault which cuts the scarp as the prolongation of the sharp\r\nsyncline of Jebel Hefhuf.\r\n\r\nFurther south, on the west side, a very dissimilar succession was\r\nfound to that on the north. Here at a distance of 20 kilometres from\r\nthe oasis wall, at a point 30 kilometres north-west of Ain el Haiss,\r\nthe uppermost member of the Cretaceous, the White Chalk itself,\r\nis overlain by a hard gray crystalline limestone containing an\r\nabundance of _Nummulites_ and _Operculina_, with _Lucina_, _Fusus_\r\nand _Natica_. The actual junction of the two series is here difficult\r\nto detect, as the White Chalk is itself altered in its upper part\r\ninto a hard gray crystalline limestone, simulating the Eocene beds\r\nthemselves, and there is little difference of dip between the two\r\nseries. The following foraminifera have been determined from this\r\nlocality by Mr. F. Chapman:—[52]\r\n\r\n  _Textularia? gramen_      |  _N. discorbina_\r\n                            |\r\n  _Globigerina bulloides_   |  _N. sub-discorbina_\r\n                            |\r\n  _Operculina complanata_,  |  _Orbitoides_ (_Discocycloides_)\r\n   var. _discoidea_         |  _dispansa_ (_O. dilabida_, Schwager).\r\n                            |\r\n  _Nummulites gizehensis_,  |\r\n   var. _Pachoi_            |\r\n                            |\r\n  _N. curvispira_           |\r\n\r\nWithin the synclinal fold at one point (Plate VII), 17 kilometres\r\nnorth-east of Ain el Haiss, Eocene echinids and nummulites were\r\nfound, but the beds from which they had weathered had been almost\r\ncompletely removed by denudation. The echinids have been recognized\r\nby Blanckenhorn as the following:—\r\n\r\n  _Porocidaris Schmedeli_.\r\n\r\n  _Echinocyamus luciana_.\r\n\r\n  _Sismondia Sæmanni_.\r\n\r\nThe following two species of nummulites have been determined by\r\nChapman:—\r\n\r\n  _Nummulites Beaumonti_.\r\n\r\n  _N. sub-Beaumonti_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beds of east side of depression.]\r\n\r\nIn the scarp due north of Harra, the Cenomanian sandstones and clays\r\nwith _Exogyra mermeti_ and _E. africana_ are conformably overlain\r\nby a hard yellow crystalline limestone containing small nummulites;\r\nso that here the Eocene clearly overlies the Cenomanian beds. If this\r\nupper limestone bed be followed southwards along the scarp (see the\r\nsections on Plate VIII) it appears to be continuous as far as the\r\nroad leading to Ain Haswi, where the ground forming the bottom of the\r\noasis-depression rises to the level of the limestone, and the clays\r\nare completely hidden by sand and limestone-debris. There commences\r\nhere, however, a considerable thickening of the limestones, and hard\r\nbrown limestones, with calcite-filled cavities, and some soft earthy\r\nbeds come in; so that here we have the beginning of the series (No 6)\r\nwhich has been described as recurring on the opposite scarp in the\r\nsame latitude, and which forms the hills north-west of Harra. The\r\ntopmost bed of the scarp is a hard crystalline limestone, which\r\nappears continuous with that containing nummulites further north,\r\nand the top of the plateau is therefore probably here also Eocene. A\r\nlittle further south, the plateau-surface is covered with countless\r\nsmall hills of white chalky limestones with siliceous beds; these\r\nbeds were searched without result for fossils, but as they overlie the\r\nhard crystalline rock, above mentioned as probably Eocene, they must\r\nbe of Tertiary age, and therefore do not correspond with the Danian\r\nwhite chalk of the western plateau. As the large hill near the plateau\r\neast-north-east of Ain el Haiss is approached, the thickening of the\r\nlower crystalline brown and grayish-white limestones is very marked,\r\nand here they probably comprise both Cenomanian and Danian rocks; but\r\nthe dip south-eastward is so strong that the Eocene must be close to\r\nthe edge of the plateau, while the folding doubtless accounts for the\r\ncrystalline nature of the rocks and their poverty in fossils. South of\r\nthe large hill, a second plateau is met with at a distance of about a\r\nkilometre eastward from the main scarp; this second plateau consists\r\nof soft chalky beds similar to those above-mentioned, underlain by\r\nclays and sandstones, while the main scarp still exhibits brown\r\nand grayish crystalline limestones, though both the dip and the\r\nthickness of these beds become gradually smaller. As the south point\r\nof the oasis is approached the limestones thin out, till at the end\r\nonly a few beds of hard yellow-brown limestone occur in the clays;\r\nthese beds are continuous with those containing Cenomanian fossils\r\non the west plateau. Thus at the south-east portion of the scarp the\r\nDanian is either absent, or represented by very thin beds at a little\r\ndistance from the oasis. It might be suggested that the soft chalky\r\nlimestones which form the second or upper plateau correspond with\r\nthe Danian white chalk of the west side; but several considerations\r\ntend to negative this view. In the first place, it has been mentioned\r\nabove that similar soft chalky limestones occur at about the same\r\nhorizon further north, where they overlie beds which are probably\r\nEocene. Again, on the line followed from the south end of the oasis\r\nof Minia, nummulites were found in abundance only a few kilometres\r\naway from the oasis. And lastly, these chalky limestones never show\r\nfolding comparable with that of the lower beds, a fact which seems\r\nnearly conclusive in view of the unconformity known to exist at\r\nother points between the Cretaceous and the Eocene.\r\n\r\nIf the Eocene age assigned above to the chalky limestones of the\r\neastern plateau be correct, it is possible that the clays and\r\nsandstones which underlie and separate them from the Cretaceous\r\nlimestones may represent the Esna Shales of the more southern oases,\r\nthough sandstones are elsewhere absent from this series.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unconformity and overlap._—From the above description of the\r\nEocene rocks of Baharia we see that their relation to the underlying\r\nCretaceous system is one of unconformable overlap.[53] In the north\r\npart of the oasis we have the Eocene (Up. Lib.-Low. Mok.) overlying\r\ndirectly the lower beds of the Cenomanian; further south, on the\r\nwest, the same beds overlie the White Chalk of Danian age, and no\r\ndoubt at an intermediate point the Eocene overlies the intermediate\r\nbeds. On the east side, though the actual demarcation of the Eocene\r\nand Cretaceous beds is a matter of some difficulty, the difference\r\nof dip between the two systems in some localities is well marked.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain then that after the deposition of the Cretaceous\r\nbeds in this region, elevation took place with a considerable amount\r\nof folding (which will be noticed fully further on). The land thus\r\nformed underwent a marked denudation before subsidence took it below\r\nthe surface of the sea and allowed of the deposition of the Eocene\r\ndeposits just described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       POST-EOCENE (OLIGOCENE?).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Ferruginous grits and quartzites, with limonite and pisolitic\r\niron-ore._ As already mentioned, one of the most striking\r\ntopographical features of the oasis is the number of isolated\r\nblack, and for the most part perfectly conical, hills within\r\nthe depression. These hills are composed of the lower Cenomanian\r\nsandstones and clays of the Cretaceous, and owe their existence\r\nand dark colour to protecting caps of very hard, dark, ferruginous,\r\nsilicified grits and quartzites, often associated with limonite. The\r\nfirst impression obtained on examining these rocks, is that they are\r\nmerely silicified and ferruginous bands of the sandstone series below,\r\nwhich forms the general oasis-floor and part of the walls and hills.\r\n\r\nA careful investigation of the deposits over a large area, however,\r\nshows this view to be untenable; for while in most of the isolated\r\nconical hills within the depression, the beds in question cap the\r\nlower sandstones and clays (No. 7) of the Cenomanian, on a portion\r\nof the edge of the western plateau they cap the bed of limestone\r\n(basal member of No. 6) which itself caps the lower sandstones and\r\nclays. (Plate I). There must therefore be an unconformable overlap\r\nbelow the two series.\r\n\r\nThis is further borne out by the facts, first, that the ferruginous\r\nsilicified grit has never been observed to pass under the limestone\r\nin the walls of the oasis, although found capping hills in close\r\nproximity; and secondly, that the limestone never occurs below\r\nthe ferruginous silicified grit in the isolated conical hills. The\r\nformer would happen if the deposit in question represented the top\r\nof the sandstones and clays, the latter if it represented the next\r\nbed above the limestone.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these beds are found capping hills close to the\r\noasis-wall, and occurring on exactly the same level as the limestone\r\ncapping the latter, suggesting at first sight some sort of connection\r\nbetween the two; the beds are, however, so entirely different that\r\nit is not possible to imagine the one to be an altered condition\r\nof the other; moreover, if such were so, the gradual passage of\r\nlimestone to the ferruginous beds should be visible, but such has\r\nnever been observed.\r\n\r\nThe only possible view of the origin of these beds, consistent\r\nwith the above facts, is that they represent a far younger deposit\r\nthan the strata on which they lie, a deposit formed in fact in a\r\nslight depression in the Eocene and Cretaceous rocks, long anterior\r\nto the time when erosion was carving out the area to its present\r\nform. The pisolitic character of the iron-ore of Jebel Horabi and\r\nthe usually large amount of ferruginous material, as well as the\r\ngeneral character of the beds, indicate shallow-water lacustrine\r\ndeposition and precipitation. No organic remains have as yet been\r\nobserved in these deposits.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned here that it is frequently impossible to\r\ndraw any sharp of line of demarcation between these deposits and the\r\nundoubted Cenomanian sandstones below, when they rest on the latter\r\nin the hills within the depression. The sandstones themselves are\r\nfrequently ferruginous and limonitic in their upper layers. This,\r\nhowever, is easily explained on the supposition that there would have\r\nbeen considerable infiltration into these porous sandstones forming\r\nthe lake-floor, with consequent deposition of ferruginous material.\r\n\r\nLithologically the beds in question present a considerable similarity\r\nto the quartzites and hard ferruginous sandstones of Jebel el Ghudda\r\nand Gar el Hamra on the road from Feshn to the oasis (ante, p. 18,\r\n20), and also to the beds of Jebel Ahmar, near Cairo, and in parts\r\nof the Fayum. In the absence of evidence of their precise age,\r\nthey may be provisionally classed as Oligocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jebel Horabi.]\r\n\r\nA short description of these beds in a few special localities will\r\nnow be given.\r\n\r\nThis well-marked hill, situated at the extreme northerly end\r\nof the depression, consists of a mass of ferruginous material,\r\nincluding limonite, pisolitic iron-ore, red and yellow ochre, etc.,\r\nlying on a series of sandy shales, clays and sandstones belonging\r\nto the Cenomanian (Series No. 7). Thin bands of limonite, etc.,\r\noccur in the clays and sandstones, but the great mass of mineral\r\nappears to form a distinct deposit capping, and in part replacing,\r\nthe former. The iron-ore occurs in every stage of purity.\r\n\r\nSamples from Jebel Horabi, analysed by Mr. A. Lucas, gave the\r\nfollowing results:—\r\n\r\n  Pisolitic ironstone       Ferric oxide  58·68% ≡ 41·07% iron.\r\n\r\n  Limonite                       „        81·06% ≡ 58·84%  „\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isolated hills in centre of Oasis.]\r\n\r\nThese hills all show the same characters, with the exception of one\r\nor two capped by limestone or basalt.\r\n\r\nThey consist of sandstones, with occasional shales and clayey bands,\r\nof the Cenomanian series (No. 7) capped by a hard brown or black\r\nsilicified ferruginous grit, which frequently passes into a typical\r\nquartzite. This cap may be of any thickness up to some seven or eight\r\nmetres. Its junction with the sandstones below is generally obscured\r\nby the mass of talus lying on the slopes, but where visible it is\r\ndifficult to draw any line of demarcation between the two, there\r\nbeing in some cases a more or less gradual increase of hardness and\r\nferruginous material from the upper part of the sandstones upwards. In\r\none hill an ordinary yellow sandstone was observed, when followed\r\nup, to contain an increasing number of ferruginous concretions,\r\nat first in isolated lumps, or strings, but higher in such quantity\r\nas to present the appearance of a breccia, which latter gradually\r\npassed up into a hard dense mass of ferruginous quartzite. This\r\nat first sight suggested a similar age for the whole rock-section,\r\nbut would be quite explicable on the supposition of infiltration,\r\nas suggested above.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.—_Basalt and Dolerite._—Three large hills in the north-west\r\nof the oasis, notably Jebel Mayesra, Jebel Mandisha, and the\r\nnorthern half of Jebel Hefhuf, are capped with a basic volcanic\r\nrock, the existence of which was noted by Cailliaud[54] so long\r\nago as 1820. Ascherson[55] further studied the distribution of\r\nthis rock in 1876, and collected specimens which were carefully\r\nexamined later by Prof. Zirkel.[56] The latter diagnosed the rock\r\nas a typical plagioclase-basalt, strongly resembling that of the\r\nGiant’s Causeway; it is finely holocrystalline, containing augite,\r\nplagioclase and olivine, with some magnetite and ilmenite, and very\r\nsparing flakes of biotite; the resemblance of the rock to basaltic\r\nintrusions in Tripoli and at Abu Zabel (between Cairo and Bilbeis)\r\nis remarked on by Zittel and Ascherson, and the opinion that it was\r\nintruded into the sandstones in later Tertiary times is put forward.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic intrusions occur at four separate points in the oasis,\r\nrepresenting two more or less inclusive areas; the total area covered\r\nby the rock is about 14 square kilometres. The intrusion appears\r\nto have been in the form of laccolites; in Jebel Hefhuf the basalt\r\nis intrusively interbedded in the Cenomanian, between the lower\r\nsandstones and the overlying limestone, both of which rocks show\r\ndistinct signs of contact-metamorphism. The sandstone shows generally\r\nvery little alteration, though in some places much hardened; while the\r\nlimestone is highly crystalline and of a beautiful red colour near the\r\nigneous rock. The crystalline nature is, however, more due to folding\r\nthan to contact-metamorphism, as it occurs in all the limestones of\r\nthe neighbourhood. In several places the vertical pipes, up which\r\nthe molten mass was thrust, with disturbance of the sandstone,\r\ncan be traced; and dykes are occasionally seen near the edge of the\r\ndeposits. The section seen in Jebel Mandisha is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._                                                         Metres.\r\n\r\n          Columnar basalt and dolerite, much broken up by\r\n          weathering                                               9·2\r\n\r\n          Sandstones, clays and sandy shales                      64·0\r\n\r\n          Ferruginous sandstones with casts of _Exogyra_      }\r\n          (thin bed)                                          }    9·2\r\n                                                              }\r\n          Sand-rock and sandstone with ferruginous bands      }\r\n                                                                  ----\r\n                                                                  82·4\r\n\r\nIn a small ⅂-shaped hill in lat. 28° 46½′ N., long. 28°\r\n48′ E. of G. a mass of basalt occurs which appears to be mainly\r\nthe remains of a large pipe or “neck.” The igneous rock here\r\nshows flow-structure at the sides, being hard and crystalline\r\nin the centre. It has altered the sandstones at the contact\r\nvery considerably, converting them into a greenish rock full of\r\nchalcedony. Here, as in the other deposits, the basalt shows distinct\r\ncolumnar jointing and the resulting blocks weather into spheroidal\r\nmasses where exposed.\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks of Baharia are therefore Post-Cretaceous in age\r\nand it seems reasonable to assume, as suggested by Mayer-Eymar,[57]\r\nthat they are of Lower Oligocene age, contemporaneous with the\r\nbasalt-sheets of the Fayum, of Abu Roash and the desert to the\r\nwest, and of Abu Zabel. The andesite neck passed on the road between\r\nMaghagha and the oasis (p. 22) and the larger masses of Bahnessa and\r\nother places in the Western Desert were likewise probably erupted\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RECENT.\r\n\r\n           1.—SAND-DUNES, SALINES AND SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blown Sand_, carried along by the prevailing north and north-west\r\nwinds, is heaped up against all obstacles in its path, such as hills\r\nand vegetation; sometimes it is carried over these obstacles, only\r\nto fall and accumulate in the wind-shadow on the other side. The\r\ncultivated lands of the villages are for the most part surrounded\r\nby sand-accumulations, and some low dunes occur in various parts of\r\nthe oasis; the positions of the latter will be better gathered from\r\nthe maps than from any mere description. Baharia itself is more free\r\nfrom sand than any of the oases to the south of it, but even here\r\nthe deposits of this material are very considerable, and as already\r\nmentioned extensive sand-dunes occur on the desert to the east,\r\nat a short distance from the depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt-swamps_ occur in the north of the oasis, having probably been\r\nproduced by the overflowing of springs forming lagoons, which have\r\ntaken the salt from the surrounding clays, the water from the springs\r\nonly containing a small percentage of salt. The salt-swamps round\r\nMandisha are now covered with a thin rough dry white crust of salt\r\nmixed with clay and sand; when this is broken through a salty sludge\r\nis seen to exist below, sometimes in a quite liquid state; the depth\r\nof sludge is probably not very great, but there is enough to immerse\r\na camel up to its neck, as was found by experience during the survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clays._—Sandy clays of recent origin occur at isolated spots on\r\nthe floor of the oasis, notably near Ain el Haiss, where they are now\r\nbeing rapidly removed by the action of the wind. Many of the springs\r\nare also depositing a certain amount of clay on the low ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE TECTONICS OF THE OASIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the district have undergone a considerable amount of\r\ndisturbance along certain lines.\r\n\r\nThe most important fold is a well-marked syncline beginning at the\r\nwest scarp in lat. 28° 7′ N. and running across the depression in\r\na direction 30° north of east until it strikes the eastern escarpment\r\nin lat. 28° 23′. This synclinal fold is remarkably sharp, the width\r\nbeing generally only a few hundred metres, but the dips so strong\r\nas to bring the limestone beds nearly vertical in places. Along the\r\nline of fold we find the whole of the series 6 and 7 brought down\r\nto the level of the floor of the oasis, but on either side the beds\r\nso quickly regain their horizontal position that no trace of the\r\nfolding is to be seen (Plate VII). The White Chalk in these folds\r\nis always altered by pressure into a hard crystalline limestone,\r\nas are also the limestones of the Cenomanian below. The fold is not\r\nactually continuous across the area, but is in reality made up of a\r\nnumber of long narrow ellipsoidal depressions, or cup-shaped hills,\r\nin which the end-dips are always less strong than those of the\r\nsides. At its most southerly point, where it runs into the scarp\r\n14 kilometres north-west of Ain el Haiss, the two series 6 and 7\r\nare found dipping northwards at angles up to 40° (and at one spot\r\n78°). On the other side of the fold the same beds dip southwards\r\nat only 5°, and the appearance of the fold at this point suggests\r\nthe existence of an accompanying fault (fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.—Section across Syncline, 12½ kilometres\r\nN.W. of Ain Haiss.\r\n\r\n_a._ Shales and sandstones with _Exogyra_, _Arca_, _Cucullaea_,\r\netc., _Neolobites vibrayeanus_, etc. _b._ Hard crystalline limestone\r\nwith flints. _c._ Sandstone passing into hard quartzite. _d._\r\nVariegated sandstones with bands of sandy limestone. _e._ Hard\r\ndark-brown siliceous crystalline limestone. _f._ Calcareous grit\r\n(≡ bone-bed) passing in part into sandstone, and capped by hard\r\ncrystalline limestone with shells.]\r\n\r\nBetween this point and Jebel Hefhuf the fold is marked by a line\r\nof low isolated limestone-capped, cup-shaped hills, the largest and\r\nbest marked of which is 16 kilometres north of Ain el Haiss. Here the\r\nmaximum dip amounts to 55° on the western side of the basin-shaped\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nJebel Hefhuf is, perhaps, the most striking part of the fold. The\r\nsouthern portion owes its existence entirely to this syncline,\r\nconsisting as it does of a long, and remarkably narrow, ridge-shaped\r\nhill of folded rocks. Dips of 50° and 60° are common in places,\r\nand the limestones implicated in the fold are usually rendered hard\r\nand highly crystalline. The highest crystalline limestones in Jebel\r\nHefhuf probably represent the White Chalk, but the beds are too\r\ncrystalline to show any traces of fossils.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that all the basaltic rocks of the oasis occur on the\r\nnorth-west side, and at no great distance from this syncline. To the\r\nnorth-east of Jebel Hefhuf the line of fold passes apparently between\r\nthe range of elongated hills west of Harra and the larger somewhat\r\ntriangular hill to the north of it, and although the limestones and\r\nclays of these hills show a considerable amount of folding they do\r\nnot exhibit it in so striking a manner as Jebel Hefhuf.\r\n\r\nContinuing the line till it cuts the last scarp, we arrive at a\r\nprominent sandstone headland, in the gullies on either side of which\r\nthe folding can be very well seen. To the west of the headland the\r\nbeds are thrown sharply up in the valley so as to be nearly vertical;\r\nthis up-throw has resulted in an actual fault, the denuded edges of\r\nthe vertical sandstone and clay-beds being overlain by a horizontal\r\nbed of limonite. The nose of the promontory is of sandstone, this\r\nbeing thrown up somewhat on the south-east side of the fault;\r\nthe upper sandstone and clay beds dip south-east again somewhat\r\nsharply on the face of the headland and come down to the level of the\r\noasis floor. It would seem therefore that at this point we have the\r\nsyncline between two sharp anticlines, the north western of which\r\nhas culminated in the fault.\r\n\r\nThe southern end of the oasis is cut out in a well-marked gentle\r\nanticline.\r\n\r\nOn the west side from Ain el Haiss southwards the whole succession\r\nof Cretaceous rocks dip steadily to the north-west at from four to\r\nfive degrees, while those on the east scarp show an equally constant\r\ndip to the south-east, which increases further north, till in the\r\nneighbourhood of lat. 28° 5′ its magnitude reaches 45°; it becomes\r\ngradually less further northwards. Owing to this strong tilting of the\r\nbeds, the large hill near the scarp consists entirely of sandstones\r\nand clays with a cap of quartzite and limonite, although nearly\r\nor quite as high as the scarp; the beds here recover their nearly\r\nhorizontal position at a very short distance north-west of the line of\r\nfolding, as do also those of the plateau on the other side the line.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-described disturbances of the beds, there are some\r\nsmaller local disturbances which are extremely well-marked. Thus\r\nfor instance the large flat-topped hill in N. lat 28° 7′ and\r\nE. long. 28° 48′, like several smaller hills E.S.E. of it, bears\r\na cap of limestones, although its height is less than that of the\r\nsandstone hills around it. The section of this hill at its western\r\nside is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._                                                         Metres.\r\n\r\n          Silicified limestone                                     0·6\r\n\r\n          Hard impure chalk                                        2·4\r\n\r\n          Silicified limestone                                     1·2\r\n\r\n          Pale green soft sandy and clayey limestone               6·1\r\n\r\n          Sandy ferruginous conglomerate                           0·3\r\n\r\n          Clays with sandy and ferruginous layers,\r\n          extending to oasis floor.                approximately  22·0\r\n                                                                  ----\r\n                                                                  32·6\r\n\r\nThe beds are horizontal, and the neighbouring smaller hills which\r\npossess a similar limestone covering are precisely of the same\r\nheight. It would seem impossible to account for these limestone\r\ncaps in the midst of higher sandstone hills except by assuming that\r\nthey mark the positions of islands, subsequently denuded, in the\r\npost-Eocene lake which deposited the limonite caps on the other hills;\r\nat the same time they evidently represent part of a synclinal fold,\r\nthough the horizontal position and non-crystalline character of the\r\nbeds show that this syncline must have been wide and shallow. It is\r\nscarcely possible to think there can have been a locally calcareous\r\ndeposit from the lake which generally deposited the sandstone and\r\nlimonite; the sudden transition from the black sandstone and limonite\r\nof the surrounding hills to the snow-white limestones of those under\r\nconsideration is so strongly marked in the field as to forbid such\r\na supposition. At the same time, no fossils were found in the beds,\r\nso they cannot be satisfactorily correlated with the limestones of\r\nthe oasis-scarps, and they are of somewhat variable character at\r\ndifferent points of the hill.\r\n\r\nIt is evident then that in the south part of the depression the\r\nCretaceous beds as a whole form a large flat anticline, which is\r\ncontinuous with that of Farafra to the south.[58] This bears out\r\nthe statement of Capt. H. G. Lyons,[59] some years ago, that he\r\nbelieved Baharia and Farafra Oases to lie on an anticlinal at right\r\nangles to that of Dakhla and Kharga. The anticlinal and synclinal\r\nfolds of Baharia are parallel and were evidently produced by the\r\nsame earth-movements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Age of the folding.]\r\n\r\nWithin the oasis-area too, some other traces of folding are visible;\r\nin lat. 28° 11′ N., long. 29° 1′ E. are two small hills of clays\r\nand sandstones (the latter locally green in colour), the beds of which\r\ndip about 30° E. and W. respectively, showing a local anticline\r\nwhose axis runs nearly north-and-south. In this neighbourhood, as\r\nin the oasis generally, it is not possible to trace the folding in\r\nthe beds of the low ground, owing to its thick sandy covering.\r\n\r\nAnother point of disturbance is on the western plateau in N. lat. 28°\r\n26′, E. long. 28° 49′, some 11½ kilometres north-west of El\r\nQasr. Here (Fig. 2) along a N.E. and S.W. line, crossing an otherwise\r\nlevel plateau, the Eocene beds, and probably also the Cretaceous\r\nbelow, are thrown up in a sharp anticlinal fold, which however, is\r\nnot continuous but consists of a number of isolated bulges, with dips\r\nup to 50°. The plateau at this point consists of Eocene Operculina\r\nand Nummulitic limestone, and the effect of the anticlinal fold is\r\nto expose the beds of sandstone below, which, as already mentioned,\r\nare probably Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—Sketch showing probable relations of Eocene\r\nand Cretaceous in anticline on Western Desert plateau, 11½ kilometres\r\nN.W. of El Qasr.\r\n\r\nEOCENE.—1.

It appears certain, however, that\r\nthey belong to two great movements, separated by a vast interval in\r\ntime. The first disturbance of the beds would appear to have taken\r\nplace at the end of the Cretaceous period, when it seems probable\r\nthat the area in question underwent upheaval into dry land. It\r\nseems tenable that it was during this movement that the large flat\r\nanticline, so well seen in the south part of Baharia and in the north\r\nof Farafra, was produced, as the Eocene beds forming the plateau\r\nimmediately to the east of the Cretaceous beds do not show any sign of\r\ndisturbance.[60] The subsiding Cretaceous land, on which these Eocene\r\ndeposits were laid down, must therefore have had the form of a long,\r\nflat, irregular ridge of anticlinal structure, probably extending\r\nfrom Dakhla through the oases of Farafra and Baharia to Abu Roash.\r\n\r\nThe other folds of Baharia, being parallel to the anticline just\r\ndealt with, would at first sight appear to date from the same\r\nmovement. With regard to the syncline, however, two observations\r\nappear which force us to consider its age as very much later; these\r\nare, first, the occurrence of nummulites and other Eocene fossils\r\nwithin the fold at a point 16 kilometres north of Ain el Haiss,\r\nand secondly, the fact that at the northern extremity of the fold,\r\nwhere it meets the eastern scarp, the Eocene beds are affected. With\r\nregard to the first of these, the beds themselves, from which the\r\nfossils had been derived, were not observed to be actually affected\r\nby the fold, and therefore the evidence here, although suggestive,\r\nis not conclusive. The evidence at the north end of the fold,\r\nhowever, if substantiated, proves that the age of the fold must be\r\npost-Eocene. With regard to the anticlinal fold on the north-western\r\nplateau there is no question, as this clearly affects the Eocene\r\nbeds; it also is parallel to the other folds. These folds affecting\r\nEocene beds, lead us to the conclusion that there was another period\r\nof possibly ever more important earth-movements, of the exact date of\r\nwhich we cannot be certain, although it is not impossible that it was\r\nclosely connected with those great earth-movements of Pliocene times,\r\nwhich gave rise to the chief topographic fixtures of N.E. Africa\r\nand S.W. Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary.]\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Geological History of the Oasis._—The oldest[61]\r\nsedimentary deposit in Egypt is the Nubian Sandstone of the\r\nCretaceous. From the general absence of marine shells in this rock\r\nwe may premise that the deposit was laid down in an inland sea or\r\nlake, which must have covered an enormous extent of country. In the\r\nnorthern part of Egypt the upper part of the Nubian Sandstone becomes\r\nfossiliferous, the fauna having an undoubted Cenomanian aspect; this\r\nis the case in Wadi Araba, at Abu Roash and in Baharia. Further to\r\nthe south, however, as in Dakhla, the Nubian Sandstone first becomes\r\nfossiliferous in Senonian times. We may explain this difference\r\nin the two localities on the supposition that a gradual subsidence\r\nwas taking place with a corresponding gradual encroachment of the\r\nsea from the north, which covered the northern part of the country\r\n(including Wadi Araba, Abu Roash and Baharia) in Cenomanian times\r\nbut did not reach the latitude of Dakhla till considerably later,\r\ni.e., in Senonian times.\r\n\r\nFrom the Cenomanian onwards throughout the Cretaceous, the\r\nBaharia area was one of continued subsidence, the lithological and\r\npalæontological characters of the beds showing evidence of a gradual\r\nincrease in conditions of depth, until the maximum was reached in\r\nthe deposition of the White Chalk in Danian times.\r\n\r\nBetween the deposition of the uppermost Cretaceous rocks and the\r\nEocene it is probable that a considerable interval elapsed, during\r\nwhich the Cretaceous was elevated into land, with much folding\r\nand fracturing of the rocks and subsequent denudation.[62] It was\r\nprobably during this upheaval that the Cretaceous of Baharia assumed\r\nits anticlinal structure.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, subsidence taking place, the Eocene sea submerged the\r\narea, and deposits were laid down on the uneven Cretaceous land in an\r\nunconformable and overlapping manner. In Baharia the lowest member\r\nof the Eocene of Egypt, the Esna Shales, is not present, although\r\nfurther to the south towards Farafra it has been observed. On the\r\neast side, some sandstones and clays met with below the white chalk\r\nbeds of the outer plateau may belong to this division.\r\n\r\nThe first undoubted Eocene deposits in the Baharia area are the\r\nlimestones with _Operculina_ and _Nummulites_ which unconformably\r\noverlie different members of the Cretaceous in the north and west\r\nsides, and eastward of the south end. The whole of the Eocene deposits\r\nare here, however, only a few metres thick, which contrasts strangely\r\nwith the enormous thickness of the deposits of the same age in the\r\nNile Valley. This is intelligible, however, on the supposition that\r\nnear the subsiding Cretaceous land the conditions for continued\r\naccumulation of deposits were not so favourable as further to the\r\neast, where deeper water conditions obtained.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in Post-Eocene times, the whole underwent upheaval, and\r\nit is probable that during this elevation the main synclinal fold[63]\r\nwas produced, together with the minor anticline. The evidence for\r\nplacing the date of the formation of the syncline anterior to the\r\ndeposition of the ferruginous grits, limonite, etc. (Series No. 3)\r\nstands on the following basis: the absence of proof of the folding in\r\nquestion having affected the beds of Series 3, and the presence of a\r\nhorizontal deposit of limonite on the upturned edges of the strata,\r\nat the point where the fold meets the eastern scarp (page 66). About\r\nthe same time, probably, basalt and dolerite was intruded into the\r\nCenomanian rocks below.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formation of depression.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of the sharp folds the upper limestones were cracked, and\r\ntheir denudation by natural agencies followed, forming a slight hollow\r\nsimilar in shape to that which the oasis now exhibits; the agent of\r\ndenudation cannot be stated with certainty, but whatever force came\r\ninto operation it would find easy work in the cracked-up rocks, and\r\nstill easier would be its task in partly removing the soft Cenomanian\r\nsandstones and clays after the harder limestones had disappeared. The\r\nprimary excavation of the hollow was followed by the formation of a\r\ngreat lake, in which were laid down deposits of sandstone, quartzite,\r\nand iron-ore; this lake doubtless surrounded islands, represented\r\nto-day by those hills which still preserve their limestone-caps;\r\nit extended, or similar lakes existed, beyond the oasis-limits,\r\nforming the quartzites and ferruginous sandstones passed on the\r\nway from Maghagha to Baharia, and was perhaps continuous with the\r\nOligocene and post-Oligocene sea which covered a large part of the\r\ncountry to the north.\r\n\r\nIn later times the area finally became continental and denudation\r\ngradually sculptured the oasis to its present form; this sculpturing\r\nwould no doubt proceed rapidly in the moist climate which is known\r\nto have existed in Egypt in Pliocene and early Pleistocene times,\r\nand is being continued to-day by the powerful agency of the desert\r\nwind-borne sand and changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe water-supply of the oasis is probably derived from the tropical\r\nrains of the mountainous regions of Central Africa, the water from\r\nwhich penetrates the ground and flows northwards along permeable beds\r\nof sandstone, etc., in which it is confined by other impermeable\r\nstrata, until tapped naturally or artificially in the great oases\r\nor depressions of the Libyan Desert.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Voyage à Méroé_, etc., _op. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Geologie, u.

This structure is marked on\r\nhis map[64] as existing some 2 kilometres north-west of El Qasr;\r\nhe appears, however, to have noted no inscription on the walls (the\r\nonly parts remaining) and his brief references to it in his memoir\r\ndo not give any data as to its age.\r\n\r\nIn his recent visit (1900) to Baharia, Steindorff[65] discovered\r\nthe remains of two Egyptian temples. The first of these exists under\r\nmodern dwellings in the middle of the village of El Qasr, in a farm\r\nbelonging to the Omda. It contains at present only one room, with no\r\ninscriptions except on the roof, whence, however, we learn that the\r\nbuilding was erected during the reign of King Apries (B.C. 588-570)\r\nto “_Ammon-Re, the Lord of the Oasis, who dwells in Desdest_,”\r\nby a certain _Weh-eb-Re-nofr_ and one _Ded-Khens-ef-Onkh_.\r\n\r\nThe second temple found by Steindorff, erected by the same “_Prince\r\nand Ruler of the Oasis_” _Ded-Khens-ef-Onkh_, lies about 2\r\nkilometres south-west of El Qasr. It was erected in the reign of\r\nAmasis (B.C. 569-526) and is therefore of somewhat later date than\r\nthe foregoing. The large room, excavated from sand by Steindorff,\r\nhas its walls ornamented with representations of Egyptian deities,\r\nthe colours of which are admirably preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that at least one, and perhaps both, of the\r\ntemples discovered by Steindorff had been previously visited by\r\nAscherson in 1876. This observer mentions (_op. cit._ p. 140) “a\r\nwell preserved underground chamber which serves as a dwelling for\r\nthe servants of the Omda, which may be of Egyptian origin. On the\r\nroof of this chamber (which is 7·25 metres long, 2·40 metres broad,\r\nand 2·90 metres high) is a line of inscription,” which latter he\r\nwas unable to read owing to the darkness. There can be no doubt of\r\nthe identity of this place with the first of the temples described by\r\nSteindorff. Further on in his memoir (p. 142) Ascherson also mentions\r\na ruin called “Qasr Megasba, a sandstone structure having its sides\r\noriented to the four cardinal points, 8·5 metres long, 6·9 metres\r\nbroad, with a small entrance-hall to the south and a large room which\r\ncan only be entered through the smaller one.” He relates that the\r\ndoor-way is walled up with crude brick, and does not say whether he\r\nentered the building or not, so that it is not certain whether this\r\nplace is identical with Steindorff’s second temple. The distance\r\nof the ruin from El Qasr, as shown on Ascherson’s map, is about 4\r\nkilometres, i.e., double that mentioned by Steindorff, but otherwise\r\nthe nature of the building is strongly suggestive of an identity.\r\n\r\nIn his exploration of the large Necropolis east of El Qasr and\r\nBawitti, Steindorff records the finding of a tomb of the New Empire,\r\ndating from the beginning of the 19th Dynasty (B.C. 1300). On clearing\r\nout this tomb, extremely interesting decorations were found on its\r\nwalls. The tomb consists of several chambers hewn in the rock,\r\nonly two of which are decorated with reliefs, and belonged to a\r\ncertain Amenhotep, prince of the Northern Oasis and of the Oasis\r\nHuye. The explorer records that on one of the walls of the first\r\nchamber Amenhotep is represented sitting by his wife, his people\r\nbringing to him all kinds of drinks and food, including fish; on\r\nanother wall he is seen superintending the manufacture of wine,\r\nwhile on a third is a lively representation of the funeral of the\r\ndeceased. The pictures on the walls of the second room are of similar\r\nkind, but of a more religious character.\r\n\r\nSteindorff remarks that this is the first important tomb of Egyptian\r\nage to be found in the oases of the Libyan Desert. It appears to have\r\nbeen used later on for other interments, as several clay mummy-shaped\r\ncoffins were found; from these the mummies had disappeared, but a\r\nfew relics such as scarabei, a gold earring, a bronze mirror, etc.,\r\nwere found.\r\n\r\nTo the Egyptian period also belongs a limestone statue of the same\r\n_Ded-Khens-ef-Onkh_ who erected the two temples of the 26th Dynasty\r\nalready mentioned; Steindorff found this in one of the houses at\r\nEl Qasr.\r\n\r\nA sandstone ruin situate 2 kilometres due west of Zubbo, mapped but\r\nnot examined by the Survey, would appear to be that of another small\r\nEgyptian temple. It is marked on Cailliaud’s map as “débris de\r\nTemple,” but is not mentioned in his description.\r\n\r\nYet a fifth temple in Baharia would seem to be represented by the ruin\r\n“Qasr Mayesra,” 2 kilometres north-west of Mandisha, visited by\r\nAscherson. This ruin, which is also mentioned by Belzoni, Cailliaud,\r\nand Wilkinson, is a small structure of sandstone 7·91 metres long,\r\n6·24 metres broad, having only one room (entered from the north),\r\nand oriented to the cardinal points. The stones of this ruin have\r\nGreek letters and other signs cut in them, possibly mason’s marks;\r\nthey are so striking as to have been seen from a distance through\r\na telescope by Belzoni.\r\n\r\nThe rock-tombs south-east of Mandisha, mentioned by Ascherson (_l.c._\r\np. 145), may possibly be further remains of the Egyptian epoch, and\r\nthe same is the case with some rock-chambers found by the Survey\r\nin the south part of the oasis, some 3 kilometres south of Ain el\r\nHaiss. The latter are excavated in an isolated rock-mass (sandstone)\r\nsome 20 metres in diameter and 6 metres high. The chief entrance is on\r\nthe south-east side of the rock, by what looks from a short distance\r\nlike a mere crack; this entrance leads into a series of four small low\r\nchambers (each about 3 metres square), with a deeper channel running\r\nalong the centre. Other similar chambers are found entering from\r\nthe north side. No inscriptions appear to exist except a few Arabic\r\nscratches near the principal entrance, and the chambers were empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (_b_) ROMAN ANTIQUITIES.\r\n\r\nThe Roman structures in the oasis differ generally from those of the\r\nEgyptian era in being built of crude brick instead of stone. They\r\nshow, however, a great solidity of construction; for this reason these\r\nerections of the Romans have in many cases outlasted those of the\r\nCoptic period which were built long afterwards; in Baharia the old\r\nRoman underground aqueducts still serve for the conveyance of water\r\nfrom the springs to the irrigated tracts, and the present inhabitants\r\nare far too indolent to construct similar channels for themselves.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ascherson (_l.c._ p. 140) the village of El Qasr owes\r\nits name to a Roman castle, abundant remains of which still exist\r\nunder the modern houses.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the Roman ruins of Baharia was however until\r\nrecently an arch situated close to the north of El Qasr. Cailliaud\r\n(_l.c._ p. 183) describes the structure (as seen in 1820) as\r\nconsisting of an “arc de triomphe” standing on an embankment 39½\r\nmetres long, with a dressed stone revetment;[66] this embankment\r\nrises 10 metres from the ground-level at the north side, and is\r\nlevel with the soil of the village to the south. The principal\r\nfaçade is to the north. The courses of the masonry are 27 to 30\r\ncentimetres high, and show a peculiar construction, headers and\r\nstretchers being built in alternate courses. The wall, which was\r\nabout 2·3 metres thick, and built with a strongly-marked batter,\r\nhad an ornamental cornice all round; above this came a sort of\r\nparapet 90 centimetres high. The substance of the embankment is a\r\nkind of concrete of irregularly-shaped stones set in cement.\r\n\r\nThe arch itself rises from the embankment in the middle of the north\r\nfaçade, and is of the Doric order, its length being 7·48 metres. At\r\nthe time of Cailliaud’s visit only the central arcade was still\r\nstanding; from it one could descend by a flight of steps on to the\r\nlower ground. The façade was ornamented with pilasters, and on each\r\nside of the arch was a niche decorated with small columns. In one\r\nof the main pillars Cailliaud saw a spiral staircase leading to a\r\nterrace on the top of the arch. The stones are frequently marked with\r\nGreek letters, doubtless to guide the builders; no hieroglyphs or\r\nother evidences of the Ancient Egyptians could be seen in the ruins.\r\n\r\nThis interesting ruin was found in a far less perfect state of\r\npreservation on the visit of Ascherson in 1876, the revetment-wall\r\nhaving mostly disappeared, possibly owing to an earthquake which is\r\nsaid to have taken place in the oasis about 1840. The latest traveller\r\nto visit the ruins (Steindorff, 1900) found that the whole structure\r\nhad fallen.[67]\r\n\r\nThe ruin known as Qasr Alam, situated about 2½ kilometres west of\r\nBawitti, visited by Wilkinson and by Ascherson, is a rectangular\r\ncrude-brick structure on a slight eminence. Only the lower parts of\r\nthe walls remain, and Wilkinson speaks of it as “an insignificant\r\ncrude-brick ruin.” Ascherson obtained a bronze hawk (now in the\r\nBerlin museum) found in this place.\r\n\r\nWilkinson mentions another ruin, similar to the above, 1 kilometre\r\nsouth-west of El Qasr; this does not appear to have been since\r\nnoted. There is no evidence to show the date of either of these\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nA nearly square building with battered walls and a fortified\r\nappearance, situated among the ruins of the Coptic village\r\nsome 4 kilometres E.S.E. from Mandisha may possibly be a Roman\r\nfort. Cailliaud gives its size as 14·7 metres long, 12 metres\r\nwide, with walls 8 metres in height, the single door being to the\r\neast. The interior is full of debris, so that the arrangement cannot\r\nbe well seen.\r\n\r\nThe same doubt as to age occurs concerning some underground chambers\r\nat El Qasr, in one of which Virchow[68] found an urn, and similar\r\nstructures at Bawitti mentioned by Ascherson.\r\n\r\nThere is less uncertainty concerning a large crude-brick ruin in\r\nthe south-east part of the oasis, some 6 kilometres E.S.E. of Ain el\r\nHaiss. This ruin, mentioned by Belzoni (_l.c._, p. 427), Cailliaud\r\n(_l.c._, p. 194, and Pl. XXXVI, fig. 1), and Wilkinson (_l.c._,\r\np. 361), stands conspicuous on an eminence; it is of considerable\r\nsize, its length being over 87 metres, and the walls being 6 metres\r\nhigh. In the interior is the debris of dwellings. It appears to have\r\nbeen a Roman castle. Belzoni and Cailliaud mention also a square\r\nbuilding with small chambers, with a square pit cut in the rock\r\nin the centre; this lies about 1 kilometre S.S.W. from the castle,\r\nand is regarded by these discoverers as an ancient bath.\r\n\r\nTo the Roman period may possibly belong a large crude-brick\r\nrectangular enclosure close to Ain el Haiss. This building is 75\r\npaces square, with a main door on the west side, and has walls about\r\n2 metres in height. The brickwork is peculiar, a course of stretchers\r\nthree bricks deep being followed by two courses of headers set on\r\nedge, with one or two rows of bricks in a perpendicular position\r\ndown the centre; the walls are 50 centimetres thick. The interior of\r\nthe place is a large court, with numerous small rooms at the north\r\nand south sides and two others on the west. The rooms are used at\r\nthe present day by the men of Bawitti when they come to gather the\r\nrice-crop at Ain el Haiss. It is not a little remarkable that no\r\nreference to this large structure is to be found in Cailliaud’s\r\naccount; its position (some 300 metres only south-west of the\r\nsheikh’s tomb at Ain el Haiss) would seem to preclude the\r\npossibility of confusing it with the other ruins he describes. He\r\ngives however (_l.c._ p. 195) the latitude of El Haiss as 28° 0′\r\n32″,[69] “latitude du couvent chrétien,” from which it would\r\nappear likely that he considered this place a convent. There is no\r\nevidence to decide whether the building is of Roman or Coptic origin.\r\n\r\nFar more enduring and more important (in a modern sense) than any\r\nof their buildings, were the extensive excavations carried out by\r\nthe Romans for the improvement of the water-supply of oasis. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Bawitti especially, long series of shafts sunk in\r\nthe sandstones and clays which form the ground, are frequently to\r\nbe seen. These shafts, which vary from 1 to 3 metres in diameter,\r\nare sometimes round, sometimes rectangular, and are placed at only\r\nshort distances apart. They are connected below with long tunnels,\r\nalong which flows the water from the springs. Cailliaud mentions the\r\nexistence of ten of these ancient aqueducts near Mandisha, eight of\r\nwhich still conveyed water in 1820; he entered one and followed it\r\nfor 40 metres. He counted no less than fourteen shafts connected\r\nwith this tunnel in a length of 150 metres, and records that one\r\nmeasured had a rectangular shape, 1·45 metres by 0·45 metres, and\r\nwas perfectly cut in the rock, with footholds for the descent of the\r\nworkmen. The largest aqueduct found by Cailliaud is south-west of\r\nEl Qasr; its size is such that a man is able to walk in it. This\r\ntunnel, which now contains no water, leads from an excavation 5\r\nmetres in diameter by 8 metres deep, and in a length of 55 metres\r\nit is entered by ten shafts. In the same neighbourhood Cailliaud\r\ncounted more than thirty other aqueducts, mostly coming from the\r\nsouth, like those of Mandisha. Four of these discharge their water\r\ninto a huge excavation 70 metres diameter and 12 metres deep. The\r\nonly example of an underground aqueduct at present known to exist\r\nin the south part of the oasis is one discovered by Ascherson a few\r\nkilometres east of Ain el Haiss; it is at present dry.\r\n\r\nThough more abundant in Baharia than in any other of the Egyptian\r\noases, doubtless on account of the relatively shallow depths at\r\nwhich water is there reached, these Roman levels are not peculiar to\r\nBaharia, several existing in Farafra,[70] one of which was noticed\r\nby Ascherson (_l.c._ p. 137); other examples have been found at\r\nAin Um Dababib and near Gennah in Kharga.[71] It appears, too,\r\nthat underground aqueducts of the same nature exist abundantly in\r\nthe oases of the Algerian and Moorish Sahara.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (_c_) COPTIC ANTIQUITIES.\r\n\r\nSome 4 kilometres E.S.E. from Mandisha are the ruins of a Coptic[72]\r\nvillage, which appear to be those described and figured by Cailliaud,\r\nalthough he gives the position as “est 35° nord de Zabou”\r\nCailliaud characterises these remains as “miserable ruins,”\r\nbut mentions specially, besides the fort referred to, two ruined\r\nchurches, larger than the other structures. The first of these is\r\n11·1 metres long, 6·50 metres wide, and has walls still 6 metres\r\nhigh; a principal door opens to the south, while another smaller\r\ndoor is situated on the north side. The interior presents only one\r\nroom, with a niche in the wall; there are three windows on each of\r\nthe two longer sides. The second ruin is of about the same size;\r\non each of its longer sides are nine niches in the wall, and higher\r\nup are six small openings for light. The building appears to have\r\nbeen vaulted. The ancient habitations which form the remainder of\r\nthe ruins are of a uniform type—low vaulted dwellings surmounted\r\nby terraces, access to which is got by steps. The entire village\r\nhas a circumference of about 520 metres. The name of the locality\r\nwhere these ruins exist is not without interest. Ascherson quotes\r\nit as “Denise,” while Wilkinson gives “Bayrees;” the name,\r\nlike that of Beris in Kharga Oasis, doubtless comes from the old\r\nEgyptian root “rs” (the south).\r\n\r\nAnother Coptic village existed in the south-east part of the oasis,\r\nin a district now called Uxor, some 10 kilometres east of Ain el\r\nHaiss. The principal ruin is that of a church, built of crude brick,\r\n19·8 metres in length.[73] The exterior displays only four bare\r\nwalls, battered, with two doors in the east part opening respectively\r\nnorth and south. In the interior is a nave, and on each side are three\r\narcades forming small chapels; in the centre is a niche ornamented\r\nwith small columns with volute capitals.\r\n\r\nAbove the chapels a gallery runs round the building. The columns of\r\nthe nave have capitals rudely modelled on the plan of the lotus-flower\r\nof the ancient Egyptians. The remains of fresco paintings can\r\nstill be traced on the walls, with Greek crosses and fragments of\r\ninscriptions. Ascherson records that he visited this ruin in 1876\r\nand found it in about the same state as Cailliaud narrates, though\r\nhe was unable to discover the inscriptions on the walls which that\r\nauthor and Wilkinson refer to.\r\n\r\nBesides the two above-mentioned, a third Coptic village seems to\r\nhave existed about 7 kilometres south-west of Mandisha, at the\r\nsouth end of the range of hills which will be seen on the map. This\r\nvillage has not been seen, apparently, by any European traveller,\r\nthough its position was pointed out to Ascherson from a distance,\r\nunder the name “Merharet-el-Fama.” Information was derived on a\r\nvisit to Ain Jafarra (6 kilometres south of Mandisha) that some ruins\r\nexisted a short distance to the north-west, and this would appear\r\nto coincide with the position given by Ascherson; time unfortunately\r\nfailed for an excursion in search of them.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin_,\r\nBand 20, 1885, pp. 110-160.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Berichte der philologisch-historischen klasse der\r\nKonigl.
