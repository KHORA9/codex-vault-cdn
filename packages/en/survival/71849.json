It was my great happiness to fall within your notice,\r\n    and to receive very substantial and seasonable favours from\r\n    your patronage and recommendations. I shall ever remain mindful\r\n    of your generosity and humanity towards me, but must lament\r\n    that I have no other means of expressing my gratitude than by\r\n    this publick acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n    Accept then, Dear Sir, my earnest wishes for your prosperity,\r\n    and think me with the truest esteem,\r\n\r\n        Your most obliged,\r\n            and obedient\r\n                humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                    John Reinhold Forster.\r\n\r\n    Warrington,\r\n    July 25th. 1770.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present Volume of Professor Kalm’s Travels through North America,\r\nis originally written in the Swedish language, but was immediately\r\nafter translated into the German by the two Murray’s, both of whom are\r\nSwedes, and one a pupil of Dr. Linnæus, and therefore we may be sure\r\nthat this translation corresponds exactly with the original.\r\n\r\nBaron Sten Charles Bielke, Vice president of the Court of Justice in\r\nFinland, was the first who made a proposal to the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences at Stockholm, to send an able man to the northern parts of\r\nSiberia and Iceland, as places which are partly under the same latitude\r\nwith Sweden, and to make there such observations and collections of\r\nseeds and plants, as would improve the Swedish husbandry, gardening,\r\nmanufactures, arts and sciences. Dr. Linnæus found the proposal just,\r\nbut he thought that a journey through North America would be yet of a\r\nmore extensive utility, than that through the before-mentioned\r\ncountries; for the plants of America were then little known, and not\r\nscientifically described, and by several trials, it seemed probable\r\nthat the greatest part of the North American plants, would bear very\r\nwell the Swedish winters; and what was more important, a great many\r\nAmerican plants promised to be very useful in husbandry and physic.\r\n\r\nThus far this journey was a mere scheme; but as Captain Triewald, a man\r\nwell known for his abilities in England, gave his Observations on the\r\nCultivation of Silk in a series of Memoirs to the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences, and mentioned therein a kind of mulberry tree, which was\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Linnæus, and which bore the rigours of the Swedish\r\nclimate as well as a fir or pine tree; this circumstance revived the\r\nproposal of such a journey in the year 1745. Count Tessin, a nobleman\r\nof established merit both in the political and learned world, becoming\r\npresident of the Royal Academy, it was unanimously agreed upon to send\r\nProfessor Kalm to North America. The expences were at first a great\r\nobstacle; but the Royal Academy wrote to the three universities to\r\nassist them in this great and useful undertaking. Aobo sent first her\r\nsmall contribution, Lund had nothing to spare, but Upsala made up this\r\ndeficiency by a liberal contribution.\r\n\r\nCount Piper was intreated to give a family exhibition to Mr. Kalm,\r\nwhich he readily promised, but as the Academy had obtained from the\r\nconvocation of the university of Upsala and the magistrates of\r\nStockholm, another exhibition of the family of Helmsfield for Mr. Kalm,\r\nCount Piper refused to grant his exhibition, as being contrary to the\r\nstatutes of the university and without any precedent, that one person\r\nshould enjoy two exhibitions. The present king of Sweden being then\r\nprince royal, successor to the throne, and chancellor of the\r\nuniversity, wrote to the convocation, and expressed his wishes to have\r\nfrom the treasury of the university for so useful a purpose, about 1000\r\nplates, or about 150l. sterling. The university complied generously\r\nwith the desire of her chancellor, and gave orders that the money\r\nshould be paid to the Royal Academy. The board for promoting\r\nmanufactures gave 300 plates, or about 45l. Mr. Kalm spent in this\r\njourney his salary, and besides very near 130l. of his own fortune, so\r\nthat at his return he found himself obliged to live upon a very small\r\npittance. The rest of the expences the Academy made up from her own\r\nfund.\r\n\r\nWe on purpose have given this detail from Mr. Kalm’s long preface, to\r\nshew the reader with what public spirit this journey has been supported\r\nin a country where money is so scarce, and what a patriotic and\r\nlaudable ardor for the promotion of sciences in general, and especially\r\nof natural history and husbandry animates the universities, the public\r\nboards, and even the private persons, in this cold climate, which goes\r\nso far, that they chuse rather to spend their own private fortunes,\r\nthan to give up so beneficial and useful a scheme. We have the same\r\ninstance in Dr. Hasselquist, who with a sickly and consumptive\r\nconstitution, went to Asia Minor, Egypt and Palestine, and collected\r\nsuch great riches in new plants and animals, that Dr. Linnæus’s system\r\nwould never have contained so many species, had he not made use of\r\nthese treasures, which the queen of Sweden generously bought by paying\r\nthe debts of Dr. Hasselquist, who died in his attempt to promote\r\nnatural history. The Reverend Mr. Osbeck in his voyage to China, made\r\nan infinite number of useful and interesting observations at the\r\nexpence of his whole salary, and published them by the contributions of\r\nhis parish. The Reverend Mr. Toreen died by the fatigues of the same\r\nvoyage, and left his letters published along with Osbeck, as a monument\r\nof his fine genius, and spirit for promoting natural history. We here\r\nlook upon the expences as trifling, but they are not so in Sweden, and\r\ntherefore are certainly the best monuments to the honour of the nation\r\nand the great Linnæus, who in respect to natural history is the primum\r\nmobile of that country.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kalm having obtained leave of his Majesty to be absent from\r\nhis post as professor, and having got a passport, and recommendations\r\nto the several Swedish ministers at the courts of London, Paris,\r\nMadrid, and at the Hague, in order to obtain passports for him in their\r\nrespective states, set out from Upsala, the 16th. of October 1747,\r\naccompanied by Lars Yungstrœm, a gardener well skilled in the knowledge\r\nof plants and mechanics, and who had at the same time a good hand for\r\ndrawing, whom he took into his service. He then set sail from\r\nGothenburgh, the 11th. of December but a violent hurricane obliged the\r\nship he was in to take shelter in the harbour of Grœmstad in Norway,\r\nfrom which place he made excursions to Arendal and Christiansand. He\r\nwent again to sea February the 8th. 1748, and arrived at London the\r\n17th. of the same month. He staid in England till August 15th. in which\r\ninterval of time he made excursions to Woodford in Essex, to little\r\nGaddesden in Hertfordshire, where William Ellis, a man celebrated for\r\nhis publications in husbandry lived, but whose practical husbandry Mr.\r\nKalm found not to be equal to the theory laid down in his writings; he\r\nlikewise saw Ivinghoe in Buckinghamshire, Eaton and several other\r\nplaces, and all the curiosities and gardens in and about London: at\r\nlast he went on board a ship, and traversed the ocean to Philadelphia\r\nin Pensylvania, which was formerly called New Sweden, where he arrived\r\nSeptember the 26th. The rest of that year he employed in collecting\r\nseeds of trees and plants, and sending them up to Sweden; and in\r\nseveral excursions in the environs of Philadelphia. The winter he\r\npassed among his countrymen at Raccoon in New Jersey. The next year\r\n1749, Mr. Kalm went through New Jersey and New York along the river\r\nHudson to Albany, and from thence, after having crossed the lakes of\r\nSt. George and Champlain, to Montreal and Quebec, he returned that very\r\nyear against winter to Philadelphia, and sent a new cargo of seeds,\r\nplants and curiosities to Sweden. In the year 1750, Mr. Kalm saw the\r\nwestern parts of Pensylvania and the coast of New Jersey; Yungstrœm\r\nstaid in the former province all the summer for the collection of\r\nseeds, and Prof. Kalm in the mean time passed New York and the blue\r\nmountains, went to Albany, then along the river Mohawk to the Iroquois\r\nnations, where he got acquainted with the Mohawk’s, Oneida’s,\r\nTuskarora’s, Onandaga’s and Kayugaw’s. He then viewed and navigated the\r\ngreat lake Ontario, and saw the celebrated fall at Niagara. In his\r\nreturn from his summer expedition, he crossed the blue mountains in a\r\ndifferent place, and in October again reached Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1751, the 13th. of February, he went at Newcastle on board\r\na ship for England, and after a passage subject to many dangers in the\r\nmost dreadful hurricanes, he arrived March the 27th. in the Thames, and\r\ntwo days after in London. He took passage for Gothenburgh May the 5th.\r\nand was the 16th. of the same month at the place of his destination,\r\nand the 13th. of June he again arrived at Stockholm, after having been\r\non this truly useful expedition three years and eight months. He\r\nafterwards returned again to his place of professor at Aobo, where in a\r\nsmall garden of his own, he cultivates many hundreds of American\r\nplants, as there is not yet a public botanical garden for the use of\r\nthe university, and he with great expectation wishes to see what plants\r\nwill bear the climate, and bear good and ripe seeds so far north. He\r\npublished the account of his journey by intervals, for want of\r\nencouragement, and fearing the expences of publishing at once in a\r\ncountry where few booksellers are found, and where the author must very\r\noften embrace the business of bookseller, in order to reimburse himself\r\nfor the expences of his publication. He published in his first volume\r\nobservations on England, and chiefly on its husbandry, where he with\r\nthe most minute scrupulousness and detail, entered into the very\r\nminutiæ of this branch of his business for the benefit of his\r\ncountrymen, and this subject he continued at the beginning of the\r\nsecond volume. A passage cross the Atlantic ocean is a new thing to\r\nSwedes, who are little used to it, unless they go in the few East India\r\nships of their country. Every thing therefore was new to Mr. Kalm, and\r\nhe omitted no circumstance unobserved which are repeated in all the\r\nnavigators from the earlier times down to our own age. It would be a\r\nkind of injustice to the public, to give all this at large to the\r\nreader. All that part describing England and its curiosities and\r\nhusbandry we omitted. The particulars of the passage from England to\r\nPensylvania we abridged; no circumstance interesting to natural history\r\nor to any other part of literature has been omitted. And from his\r\narrival at Philadelphia, we give the original at large, except where we\r\nomitted some trifling circumstances, viz. the way of eating oysters,\r\nthe art of making apple dumplings, and some more of the same nature,\r\nwhich struck that Swedish gentleman with their novelty.\r\n\r\nMr. Kalm makes use of the Swedish measure; its foot is to the English\r\nfoot, as 1134 to 1350. For his meteorological observations, he employed\r\nthe thermometer of Prof. Celsius generally made use of in Sweden, and\r\nhis was of Celsius’s own making; the interval from the point of\r\nfreezing to the point of boiling water, is equally divided in this\r\nthermometer into 100 parts. In the names of plants, we have chiefly\r\nemployed after his directions the Linnæan names in the last edition of\r\nhis Spec. Plantarum, and Systema Naturæ, Vol. 2. But as his\r\ndescriptions of animals, plants, and minerals are very short, he\r\npromises to give them at large some time hence in a Latin work. He\r\nexcuses the negligence of his stile, from the time in which he\r\nmethodised his observations, which was commonly at night, after being\r\nfatigued with the business of the preceding day, when his spirits were\r\nalmost exhausted, and he, incapable of that sprightliness which\r\ncommends so many curious performances of that nature.\r\n\r\nHe gives you his observations as they occurred day after day, which\r\nmakes him a faithful relater, notwithstanding it takes away all\r\nelegance of style, and often occasions him to make very sudden\r\ntransitions from subjects very foreign to one another. This defect we\r\nwill endeavour to supply by a very copious index at the end of the\r\nwhole work, rather than derange the author’s words, which are the more\r\nto be relied on, as being instantly committed to paper warm from his\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nAt last he arms himself with a very noble indifference against the\r\ncriticism of several people, founded on the great aim he had in view by\r\nhis performance, which was no less than public utility. This he looks\r\nupon as the true reward of his pains and expences.\r\n\r\nThese are the contents of his long preface. We have nothing to add, but\r\nthat we intend to go on in this work as soon as possible, hoping to be\r\nsupported and encouraged in this undertaking, by a nation which is the\r\npossessor of that great continent, a great part of which is here\r\naccurately and impartially described, especially at this time when\r\nAmerican affairs attract the attention of the public.\r\n\r\nWe intend to join for the better illustration of the work, a map and\r\ndrawings of American birds and animals which were not in the original.\r\nThey will be copied from original drawings and real birds and animals\r\nfrom North America, which we have access to, and must therefore give to\r\nthis translation a superiority above the original and the German\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\nAn encourager of this work proposed it as an improvement to the\r\ntranslation of Kalm’s travels, to add in the margin the paging of the\r\noriginal, as by this means recourse would be had easily to the\r\nquotations made by Dr. Linnæus. We would very readily have complied\r\nwith this desideratum, had we had the Swedish edition of this work at\r\nhand, or had the work not been too far advanced at the time we got this\r\nkind hint: however this will be remedied by a copious index, which will\r\ncertainly appear at the end of the whole work.\r\n\r\nAs we have not yet been able to procure a compleat list of the\r\nsubscribers and encouragers of this undertaking, we choose rather to\r\npostpone it, than to give an imperfect one: at the same time we assure\r\nthe public, that it shall certainly appear in one of the subsequent\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nWe find it necessary here to mention, that as many articles in Mr.\r\nKalm’s travels required illustrations, the publisher has taken the\r\nliberty to join here and there some notes, which are marked at the end\r\nwith F. The other notes not thus marked were kindly communicated by the\r\npublisher’s friends.\r\n\r\nLastly, we take this opportunity to return our most sincere thanks in\r\nthis public manner to the ladies and gentlemen, who have generously in\r\nvarious ways exerted themselves in promoting the publication of these\r\nuseful remarks of an impartial, accurate and judicious foreigner, on a\r\ncountry which is at present so much the object of public deliberation\r\nand private conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER KALM’s TRAVELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust the 5th. 1748.\r\n\r\nI with my servant Lars Yungstrœm (who joined to his abilities as\r\ngardener, a tolerable skill in mechanics and drawing) went at Gravesend\r\non board the Mary Gally, Captain Lawson, bound for Philadelphia; and\r\nthough it was so late as six o’clock in the afternoon, we weighed\r\nanchor and sailed a good way down the Thames before we again came to\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nAugust the 6th. Very early in the morning we resumed our voyage, and\r\nafter a few hours sailing we came to the mouth of the Thames, where we\r\nturned into the channel and sailed along the Kentish coast, which\r\nconsists of steep and almost perpendicular chalk hills, covered at the\r\ntop with some soil and a fine verdure, and including strata of flints,\r\nas it frequently is found in this kind of chalk-hills in the rest of\r\nEngland. And we were delighted in viewing on them excellent corn\r\nfields, covered for the greatest part with wheat, then ripening.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock at night, we arrived at Deal, a little well known town,\r\nsituate at the entrance of a bay exposed to the southern and easterly\r\nwinds. Here commonly the outward bound ships provide themselves with\r\ngreens, fresh victuals, brandy, and many more articles. This trade, a\r\nfishery, and in the last war the equipping of privateers, has enriched\r\nthe inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAugust the 7th. When the tide was out, I saw numbers of fishermen\r\nresorting to the sandy shallow places, where they find round small\r\neminences caused by the excrements of the log worms, or sea worms,\r\n(Lumbrici marini. Linn.) who live in the holes leading to these\r\nhillocks, sometimes eighteen inches deep, and they are then dug out\r\nwith a small three tacked iron fork and used as baits.\r\n\r\nAugust the 8th. At three o’clock we tided down the channel, passed\r\nDover, and saw plainly the opinion of the celebrated Camden in his\r\nBritannia confirmed, that here England had been formerly joined to\r\nFrance and Flanders by an isthmus. Both shores form here two opposite\r\npoints; and both are formed of the same chalk hills, which have the\r\nsame configuration, so that a person acquainted with the English coasts\r\nand approaching those of Picardy afterwards, without knowing them to be\r\nsuch, would certainly take them to be the English ones. [1]\r\n\r\nAugust the 9th–12th. We tided and alternately sailed down the channel,\r\nand passed Dungness, Fairlight, the Isle of Wight, Portsmouth, the\r\nPeninsula of Portland and Bolthead, a point behind which Plymouth lies;\r\nduring all which time we had very little wind.\r\n\r\nAugust the 13th. Towards night we got out of the English channel into\r\nthe Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\nAugust the 14th. We had contrary wind, and this increased the rolling\r\nof the ship, for it is generally remarked that the Bay of Biscay has\r\nthe greatest and broadest waves, which are of equal size with those\r\nbetween America and Europe; they are commonly half an English mile in\r\nlength, and have a height proportionable to it. The Baltic and the\r\nGerman ocean has on the contrary short and broken waves.\r\n\r\nWhenever an animal is killed on board the ship, the sailors commonly\r\nhang some fresh pieces of meat for a while into the sea, and it is\r\nsaid, it then keeps better.\r\n\r\nAugust the 15th. The same swell of the sea still continued, but the\r\nwaves began to smooth, and a foam swimming on them was said to forebode\r\nin calm weather, a continuance of the same for some days.\r\n\r\nAbout noon a north easterly breeze sprung up, and in the afternoon it\r\nblew more, and this gave us a fine spectacle; for the great waves\r\nrolled the water in great sheets, in one direction, and the north\r\neasterly wind curled the surface of these waves quite in another. By\r\nthe beating and dashing of the waves against one another, with a more\r\nthan ordinary violence, we could see that we passed a current, whose\r\ndirection the captain could not determine.\r\n\r\nAugust the 16th–21st. The same favourable breeze continued to our great\r\ncomfort and amazement, for the captain observed that it was very\r\nuncommon to meet with an easterly or north-easterly wind between Europe\r\nand the Azores (which the sailors call the Western Islands) for more\r\nthan two days together; for the more common wind is here a westerly\r\none: but beyond the Azores they find a great variety of winds,\r\nespecially about this time of the year; nor do the westerly winds\r\ncontinue long beyond these isles; and to this it is owing, that when\r\nnavigators have passed the Azores, they think they have performed one\r\nhalf of the voyage, although in reality it be but one third part. These\r\nisles come seldom in sight; for the navigators keep off them, on\r\naccount of the dangerous rocks under water surrounding them. Upon\r\nobservation and comparison of the journal, we found that we were in\r\nforty-three deg. twenty-four min. north lat. and thirty and a half\r\ndegrees west long. from London.\r\n\r\nAugust the 22d. About noon the captain assured us, that in twenty-four\r\nhours we should have a south-west wind: and upon my enquiring into the\r\nreasons of his foretelling this with certainty, he pointed at some\r\nclouds in the south-west, whose points turned towards north-east, and\r\nsaid they were occasioned by a wind from the opposite quarter. At this\r\ntime I was told we were about half way to Pensylvania.\r\n\r\nAugust the 23d. About seven o’clock in the morning the expected\r\nsouth-west wind sprung up, and soon accelerated our course so much,\r\nthat we went at the rate of eight knots an hour.\r\n\r\nAugust the 24th. The wind shifted and was in our teeth. We were told by\r\nsome of the crew to expect a little storm, the higher clouds being very\r\nthin and striped and scattered about the sky like parcels of combed\r\nwool, or so many skains of yarn, which they said forebode a storm.\r\nThese striped clouds ran north-west and south-east, in the direction of\r\nthe wind we then had. Towards night the wind abated and we had a\r\nperfect calm, which is a sign of a change of wind.\r\n\r\nAugust the 25th. and 26th. A west wind sprung up and grew stronger and\r\nstronger, so that at last the waves washed our deck.\r\n\r\nAugust the 27th. In the morning we got a better wind, which went\r\nthrough various points of the compass and brought on a storm from\r\nnorth-east towards night.\r\n\r\nOur captain told me an observation founded on long experience, viz.\r\nthat though the winds changed frequently in the Atlantic ocean,\r\nespecially in summer time, the most frequent however was the western,\r\nand this accounts for the passage from America to Europe commonly being\r\nshorter, than that from Europe to America. Besides this, the winds in\r\nthe Atlantic during summer are frequently partial, so that a storm may\r\nrage on one part of it, and within a few miles of the place little or\r\nno storm at all may be felt. In winter the winds are more constant,\r\nextensive and violent; so that then the same wind reigns on the greater\r\npart of the ocean for a good while, and causes greater waves than in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nAugust the 30th. As I had observed the night before some strong flashes\r\nof lightening without any subsequent clap of thunder, I enquired of our\r\ncaptain, whether he could assign any reasons for it. He told me these\r\nphœnomena were pretty common, and the consequence of a preceding heat\r\nin the atmosphere; but that when lightenings were observed in winter,\r\nprudent navigators were used to reef their sails, as they are by this\r\nsign certain of an impendent storm; and so likewise in that season, a\r\ncloud rising from the north-west, is an infallible forerunner of a\r\ngreat tempest.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 7th. As we had the first day of the month contrary wind,\r\non the second it shifted to the north, was again contrary the third,\r\nand fair the fourth and following days. The fifth we were in forty deg.\r\nthree min. north lat. and between fifty-three and fifty-four deg. west\r\nlong. from London.\r\n\r\nBesides the common waves rolling with the wind, we met on the 4th. and\r\n5th. inst. with waves coming from south-west, which the captain gave as\r\na mark of a former storm from that quarter in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 8th. We crossed by a moderate wind, a sea with the\r\nhighest waves we met on the whole passage, attributed by the captain to\r\nthe division between the great ocean and the inner American gulf; and\r\nsoon after we met with waves greatly inferior to those we observed\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 9th. In the afternoon we remarked that in some places the\r\ncolour of the sea (which had been hitherto of a deep blue) was changed\r\ninto a paler hue; some of these spots were narrow stripes of twelve or\r\nfourteen fathoms breadth, of a pale green colour, which is supposed to\r\nbe caused by the sand, or as some say, by the weeds under water.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 12th. We were becalmed that day, and as we in this\r\nsituation observed a ship, which we suspected to be a Spanish\r\nprivateer, our fear was very great; but we saw some days after our\r\narrival at Philadelphia the same ship arrive, and heard that they\r\nseeing us had been under the same apprehensions with ourselves.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 13th. Captain Lawson, who kept his bed for the greater\r\npart of the voyage, on account of an indisposition, assured us\r\nyesterday we were in all appearance very near America: but as the mate\r\nwas of a different opinion, and as the sailors could see no land from\r\nthe head of the mast, nor find ground by the lead, we steered on\r\ndirectly towards the land. About three o’clock in the morning the\r\ncaptain gave orders to heave the lead, and we found but ten fathom: the\r\nsecond mate himself took the lead and called out ten and fourteen\r\nfathoms, but a moment after the ship struck on the sand, and this shock\r\nwas followed by four other very violent ones. The consternation was\r\nincredible; and very justly might it be so; for there were above eighty\r\npersons on board, and the ship had but one boat: but happily our ship\r\ngot off again, after having been turned. At day break, which followed\r\nsoon after (for the accident happened half an hour past four) we saw\r\nthe continent of America within a Swedish mile before us: the coast was\r\nwhitish, low, and higher up covered with firs. We found out, that the\r\nsand we struck on, lay opposite Arcadia in Maryland, in thirty-seven\r\ndeg. fifty min. North lat.\r\n\r\nWe coasted the shores of Maryland all the day, but not being able to\r\nreach cape Hinlopen, where we intended to take a pilot on board, we\r\ncruized all night before the bay of Delaware. The darkness of the night\r\nmade us expect a rain, but we found that only a copious fall of dew\r\nensued, which made our coats quite wet, and the pages of a book,\r\naccidently left open on the deck, were in half an hours time after\r\nsun-setting likewise wet, and we were told by the captain and the\r\nsailors that both in England and in America a copious dew was commonly\r\nfollowed by a hot and sultry day.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 14th. We saw land on our larboard in the west, which\r\nappeared to be low, white, sandy, and higher up the country covered\r\nwith firs, cape Hinlopen is a head of land running into the sea from\r\nthe western shore, and has a village on it. The eastern shore belongs\r\nhere to New Jersey, and the western to Pensylvania. The bay of Delaware\r\nhas many sands, and from four to eleven fathom water.\r\n\r\nThe fine woods of oak, hiccory and firs covering both shores made a\r\nfine appearance, and were partly employed in ship-building at\r\nPhiladelphia; for which purpose every year some English captains take a\r\npassage in autumn to this town, and superintend the building of new\r\nships during winter, with which they go to sea next spring: and at this\r\ntime it was more usual than common, as the French and Spanish\r\nprivateers had taken many English merchant ships.\r\n\r\nA little after noon we reached the mouth of Delaware river, which is\r\nhere about three English miles broad, but decreases gradually so much,\r\nthat it is scarcely a mile broad at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHere we were delighted in seeing now and then between the woods some\r\nfarm houses surrounded with corn fields, pastures well-stocked with\r\ncattle, and meadows covered with fine hay; and more than one sense was\r\nagreeably affected, when the wind brought to us the finest effluvia of\r\nodoriferous plants and flowers, or that of the fresh made hay: these\r\nagreeable sensations and the fine scenery of nature on this continent,\r\nso new to us, continued till it grew quite dark.\r\n\r\nHere I will return to sea, and give the reader a short view of the\r\nvarious occurrences belonging to Natural-History, during our crossing\r\nthe Ocean.\r\n\r\nOf sea weeds (Fucus linn.) we saw August the 16th. and 17th. a kind\r\nwhich had a similarity to a bunch of onions tied together, these\r\nbunches were of the size of the fist, and of a white colour. Near the\r\ncoast of America within the American gulf, September the 11th. we met\r\nlikewise with several sea weeds, one species of which was called by the\r\nsailors rock-weed; another kind looked like a string of pearls, and\r\nanother was white, about a foot long, narrow, every where equally wide\r\nand quite strait. From August the 24th. to September the 11th. we saw\r\nno other weeds, but those commonly going under the name of Gulf-weed,\r\nbecause they are supposed to come from the gulf of Florida; others call\r\nit Sargazo, and Dr. Linnæus, Fucus natans. Its stalk is very slender,\r\nrotundato-angulated, and of a dark green, it has many branches and each\r\nof them has numerous leaves disposed in a row, they are extremely thin,\r\nare serrated, and are a line or a line and a half wide, so that they\r\nbear a great resemblance to the leaves of Iceland-moss; their colour is\r\na yellowish green. Its fruit in a great measure resembles unripe\r\njuniper berries, is round, greenish yellow, almost smooth on the\r\noutside, and grows under the leaves on short footstalks, of two or\r\nthree lines length; under each leaf are from one to three berries, but\r\nI never have seen them exceed that number. Some berries were small, and\r\nwhen cut were quite hollow and consisted of a thin peel only, which is\r\ncalculated to communicate their buoyancy to the whole plant. The leaves\r\ngrow in proportion narrower, as they approach the extremities of the\r\nbranches: their upper sides are smooth, the ribs are on the under\r\nsides, and there likewise appear small roots of two, three or four\r\nlines length. I was told by our mate that gulf weed, dried and pounded,\r\nwas given in America to women in childbed, and besides this it is also\r\nused there in fevers. The whole ocean is as if it were covered with\r\nthis weed, and it must also be in immense quantities in the gulf of\r\nFlorida, from whence all this driving on the ocean is said to come.\r\nSeveral little shells pointed like horns, and Escharæ or Horn wracks\r\nare frequently found on it: and seldom is there one bundle of this\r\nplant to be met with, which does not contain either a minute shrimp, or\r\na small crab, the latter of which is the Cancer minutus of Dr. Linnæus.\r\nOf these I collected eight, and of the former three, all which I put in\r\na glass with water: the little shrimp moved as swift as an arrow round\r\nthe glass, but sometimes its motion was slow, and sometimes it stood\r\nstill on one side, or at the bottom of the glass. If one of the little\r\ncrabs approached, it was seized by its forepaws, killed and sucked; for\r\nwhich reason they were careful to avoid their fate. It was quite of the\r\nshape of a shrimp; in swimming it moved always on one side, the sides\r\nand the tail moving alternately. It was capable of putting its forepaws\r\nentirely into its mouth: its antennæ were in continual motion. Having\r\nleft these little shrimps together with the crabs during night, I found\r\non the morning all the crabs killed and eaten by the shrimps. The\r\nformer moved when alive with incredible swiftness in the water.\r\nSometimes when they were quite at the bottom of the glass, with a\r\nmotion something like to that of a Puceron or Podura of Linnæus; they\r\ncame in a moment to the surface of the water. In swimming they moved\r\nall their feet very close, sometimes they held them down as other crabs\r\ndo, sometimes they lay on their backs, but as soon as the motion of\r\ntheir feet ceased, they always sunk to the bottom. The remaining\r\nshrimps I preserved in spirits, and the loss of my little crabs was\r\nsoon repaired by other specimens which are so plentiful in each of the\r\nfloating bundles of gulf-weed. For a more minute description of which I\r\nmust refer the reader to another work, I intend to publish. In some\r\nplaces we saw a crab of the size of the fist, swimming by the continual\r\nmotion of its feet, which being at rest, the animal began immediately\r\nto sink. And one time I met with a great red crawfish, or lobster,\r\nfloating on the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nBlubbers, or Medusæ Linn., we found of three kinds: the first is the\r\nMedusa aurita Linn.; it is round, purple coloured, opens like a bag,\r\nand in it are as if it were four white rings, their size varies from\r\none inch diameter to six inches; they have not that nettling and\r\nburning quality which other blubbers have, such for instance as are on\r\nthe coast of Norway, and in the ocean. These we met chiefly in the\r\nchannel and in the Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\nAfter having crossed more than half of the ocean between Europe and\r\nAmerica, we met with a kind of blubber, which is known to Sailors by\r\nthe name of the Spanish or Portugueze man of War, it looks like a great\r\nbladder, or the lungs of a quadruped, compressed on both sides, about\r\nsix inches in diameter, of a fine purple-red colour, and when touched\r\nby the naked skin of the human body, it causes a greater burning than\r\nany other kind of blubber. They are often overturned by the rolling of\r\nthe waves, but they are again standing up in an instant, and keep the\r\nsharp or narrow side uppermost.\r\n\r\nWithin the American gulf we saw not only these Spanish men of War, but\r\nanother kind too, for which the Sailors had no other name but that of a\r\nblubber. It was of the size of a pewter plate, brown in the middle,\r\nwith a pale margin, which was in continual motion.\r\n\r\nOf the Lepas anatifera Linn. I saw on the 30th. of August a log of\r\nwood, which floated on the ocean, quite covered. Of insects I saw in\r\nthe channel, when we were in sight of the Isle of Wight several white\r\nbutterflies, very like to the Papilio Brassicæ Linn. They never\r\nsettled, and by their venturing at so great a distance from land they\r\ncaused us just astonishment.\r\n\r\nSome common flies were in our cabbin alive during the whole voyage, and\r\nit cannot therefore be determined whether they were originally in\r\nAmerica, or whether they came over with the Europeans.\r\n\r\nOf Cetaceous fish we met with Porpesses, or as some sailors call them\r\nSea-hogs [2] (Delphinus Phocæna, Linn.) first in the channel and then\r\nthey continued every where on this side the Azores, where they are the\r\nonly fish navigators meet with; but beyond these isles they are seldom\r\nseen, till again in the neighbourhood of America we saw them equally\r\nfrequent to the very mouth of Delaware river. They always appeared in\r\nshoals, some of which consisted of upwards of an hundred individuals;\r\ntheir swimming was very swift, and though they often swam along side of\r\nour ship, being taken as it were with the noise caused by the ship\r\ncutting the waves, they however soon outwent her, when they were tired\r\nwith staring at her. They are from four to eight feet long, have a bill\r\nlike in shape to that of a goose, a white belly, and leap up into the\r\nair frequently four feet high, and from four to eight feet in length;\r\nthough their snoring indicates the effort which a leap of that nature\r\ncosts them. Our sailors made many vain attempts to strike one of them\r\nwith the harp iron from the forecastle, when they came within reach,\r\nbut their velocity always eluded their skill.\r\n\r\nAnother cetaceous fish, of the Dolphin kind, [3] with which we met, is\r\ncalled by the sailors Bottle-nose, it swims in great shoals, has a head\r\nlike a bottle, and is killed by a harpoon, and is sometimes eaten.\r\nThese fish are very large, and some fully twelve feet long; their\r\nshape, and manner of tumbling and swimming make them nearly related to\r\nPorpesses. They are to be met with every where in the ocean from the\r\nchannel to the very neighbourhood of America.\r\n\r\nOne Whale we saw at a distance, and knew it by the water which it\r\nspouted up.\r\n\r\nA Dog-fish of a considerable size followed the ship for a little while,\r\nbut it was soon out of sight, without our being able to determine to\r\nwhich species it belonged: this was the only cartilaginous fish we saw\r\non the whole passage.\r\n\r\nOf the bony fish, we saw several beyond the Azores, but never one on\r\nthis side of those isles, one of them was of a large size, and we saw\r\nit at a distance; the sailors called it an Albecor, and it is Dr.\r\nLinnæus’s Scomber Thynnus.\r\n\r\nThe Dolphin of the English is the Dorado of the Portugueze, and Dr.\r\nLinnæus calls it Coryphæna Hippuris; it is about two feet and a half\r\nlong, near the head six inches deep, and three inches broad; from the\r\nhead the Dolphin decreases on all sides towards the tail, where its\r\nperpendicular depth is one inch and a half, and its breadth hardly one\r\ninch. The colour of the back near the head is a fine green on a silver\r\nground, but near the tail of a deep blue; the belly is white, and\r\nsometimes mixed with a deep yellow, on the sides it has some round pale\r\nbrown spots. It has six and not seven fins as was imagined; two of them\r\nare on the breast, two on the belly, one at the tail extending to the\r\nanus, and one along the whole back, which is of a fine blue: when the\r\nfish is just taken the extremities of the most outward rays in the tail\r\nwere eight inches one from another. Their motion when they swam behind,\r\nor along side of the ship was very slow, and gave a fair opportunity to\r\nhit them with the harpoon, though some are taken with a hook and line,\r\nand a bait of chicken bowels, small fish, or pieces of his own species,\r\nor the flying fish, which latter are their chief food: and it is by\r\ntheir chasing them, that the flying fish leave their element to find\r\nshelter in one to which they are strangers. The Dolphins sometimes leap\r\na fathom out of the water, and love to swim about casks and logs of\r\nwood, that sometimes drive in the sea. They are eaten with thick\r\nbutter, when boiled, and sometimes fried, and afford a palatable food,\r\nbut rather somewhat dry. In the bellies of the fish of this species\r\nwhich we caught, several animals were found, viz. an Ostracion; a\r\nlittle fish with blue eyes, which was yet alive, being just the moment\r\nbefore swallowed, and measuring two inches in length; another little\r\nfish; a curious marine insect, and a flying fish, all which not yet\r\nbeing damaged by digestion, I preserved in spirits.\r\n\r\nThe Flying Fish (Exocoetus volitans, Linn.) are always seen in great\r\nshoals, sometimes of an hundred or more getting at once out of the\r\nwater, being pursued by greater fish, and chiefly by Dolphins; they\r\nrise about a yard, and even a fathom above the water in their flight,\r\nbut this latter height they only are at, when they take their flight\r\nfrom the top of a wave; and sometimes it is said they fall on the deck\r\nof ships. The greatest distance they fly, is a good musket-shot, and\r\nthis they perform in less than half a minute’s time; their motion is\r\nsomewhat like that of the yellow-hammer, (Emberiza Citrinella, Linn.).\r\nIt is very remarkable that I found the course they took always to be\r\nagainst the wind, and though I was contradicted by the sailors, who\r\naffirmed that they went at any direction, I nevertheless was confirmed\r\nin my opinion by a careful observation during the whole voyage,\r\naccording to which they fly constantly either directly against the\r\nwind, or somewhat in an oblique direction. [4]\r\n\r\nWe saw likewise the fish called Bonetos, (Scomber Pelamys, Linn.) they\r\nwere likewise in shoals, hunting some smaller fish, which chase caused\r\na noise like to that of a cascade, because they were all swimming close\r\nin a body; but they always kept out of the reach of our harpoons.\r\n\r\nOf amphibious animals, or reptiles; we met twice with a Turtle, one of\r\nwhich was sleeping, the other swam without taking notice of our ship;\r\nboth were of two feet diameter.\r\n\r\nBirds are pretty frequently seen on the ocean, though Aquatic Birds are\r\nmore common than Land Birds.\r\n\r\nThe Petrel (Procellaria Pelagica, Linn.) was our companion from the\r\nchannel to the shores of America. Flocks of this bird were always about\r\nour ship, chiefly in that part of the sea, which being cut by the ship,\r\nforms a smooth surface, where they frequently seem to settle, though\r\nalways on the wing. They pick up or examine every thing that falls\r\naccidentally from the ship, or is thrown over board: little fish seem\r\nto be their chief food; in day time they are silent, in the dark\r\nclamorous; they are reputed to forebode a storm, for which reason the\r\nsailors disliking their company, complimented them with the name of\r\nwitches; but they are as frequent in fair weather, without a storm\r\nfollowing their appearance. To me it appeared as if they stayed\r\nsometimes half an hour and longer under the waves, and the sailors\r\nassured me they did. They look like swallows, and like them they skim\r\nsometimes on the water.\r\n\r\nThe Shearwater (Procellaria Puffinus, Linn.) is another sea-bird, which\r\nwe saw every where on our voyage, from the channel to the American\r\ncoasts; it has much the appearance and size of the dark-grey Sea-gull,\r\nor of a Duck; it has a brown back, and commonly a white ring round its\r\nneck, and a peculiar slow way of flying. We plainly saw some of these\r\nbirds feed on fish.\r\n\r\nThe Tropic bird (Phaëton æthereus, Linn.) has very much the shape of a\r\ngull, but two very long feathers, which it has in its tail, distinguish\r\nit enough from any other bird; its flight is often exceedingly high:\r\nthe first of this kind we met, was at about forty deg. north lat. and\r\nforty-nine or fifty deg. west long. from London.\r\n\r\nCommon Gulls (Larus canus, Linn.) we saw, when we were opposite the\r\nLand’s End, the most westerly cape of England, and when according to\r\nour reckoning we were opposite Ireland.\r\n\r\nTerns (Sterna hirundo, Linn.) though of a somewhat darker colour than\r\nthe common ones, we found after the forty-first deg. of north lat. and\r\nforty-seventh deg. west long. from London, very plentifully, and\r\nsometimes in flocks of some hundreds; sometimes they settled, as if\r\ntired, on our ship.\r\n\r\nWithin the American gulph we discovered a sea-bird at a little distance\r\nfrom the ship, which the sailors called a Sea-hen.\r\n\r\nLand-birds are now and then seen at sea, and sometimes at a good\r\ndistance from any land, so that it is often difficult, to account for\r\ntheir appearance in so uncommon a place. August the 18th. we saw a bird\r\nwhich settled on our ship, and was perfectly like the great Titmouse,\r\n(Parus major, Linn.) upon an attempt to catch it, it got behind the\r\nsails, and could never be caught.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 1st. We observed some Land-birds flying about our ship,\r\nwhich we took for Sand Martins (Hirundo riparia, Linn.) sometimes they\r\nsettled on our ship, or on the sails; they were of a greyish brown\r\ncolour on their back, their breast white, and the tail somewhat\r\nfurcated; a heavy shower of rain drove them afterwards away, September\r\nthe 2d. a Swallow fluttered about the ship, and sometimes it settled on\r\nthe mast; it seemed to be very tired; several times it approached our\r\ncabin windows, as if it was willing to take shelter there. These cases\r\nhappened about forty deg. north lat. and between forty-seven and\r\nforty-nine deg. west long. from London, and also about twenty deg.\r\nlong. or more than nine hundred and twenty sea miles from any land\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 10th. within the American gulph a large bird, which we\r\ntook for an Owl, and likewise a little bird settled on our sails.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 12th. a Wood-pecker settled on our rigging: its back was\r\nof a speckled grey, and it seemed extremely fatigued. And another\r\nland-bird of the passerine class, endeavoured to take shelter and rest\r\non our ship.\r\n\r\nBefore I entirely take leave of the sea, I will communicate my\r\nobservations on two curious phœnomena.\r\n\r\nIn the channel and in the ocean we saw at night time, sparks of fire,\r\nas if flowing on the water, especially where it was agitated, sometimes\r\none single spark swam for the space of more than one minute on the\r\nocean before it vanished. The sailors observed them commonly to appear\r\nduring, and after a storm from the north, and that often the sea is as\r\nif it were full of fire, and that some such shining sparks would\r\nlikewise stick to the masts and sails.\r\n\r\nSometimes this light had not the appearance of sparks, but looked\r\nrather like the phosphorescence of putrid wood.\r\n\r\nThe Thames-water which made our provision of fresh water, is reputed to\r\nbe the best of any. It not only settled in the oak casks it is kept in,\r\nbut becomes in a little time stinking, when stopped up; however this\r\nnauseous smell it soon looses, after being filled into large stone\r\njuggs, and exposed to the open fresh air for two or three hours\r\ntogether. Often the vapours arising from a cask which has been kept\r\nclose and stopped up for a great while take fire, if a candle is held\r\nnear them when the cask is opened, and the Thames water is thought to\r\nhave more of this quality than any other; though I was told that this\r\neven happened with any other water in the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nNow I can resume my narrative, and therefore observe that we afterwards\r\nsailed on the river with a fair wind, pretty late at night. In the dawn\r\nof the evening we passed by Newcastle, a little town on the western\r\nshore of the river Delaware. It was already so dark, that we could\r\nhardly know it, but by the light which appeared through some of the\r\nwindows. The Dutch are said to have been the first founders of this\r\nplace, which is therefore reckoned the most ancient in the country,\r\neven more ancient than Philadelphia. But its trade can by no means be\r\ncompared with the Philadelphia trade, though its situation has more\r\nadvantages in several respects; one of which is, that the river seldom\r\nfreezes before it, and consequently ships can come in and go out at any\r\ntime. But near Philadelphia it is almost every winter covered with ice,\r\nso that navigation is interrupted for some weeks together. But the\r\ncountry about Philadelphia and farther up, being highly cultivated, and\r\nthe people bringing all their goods to that place, Newcastle must\r\nalways be inferior to it.\r\n\r\nI mentioned, that the Dutch laid the foundations of this town. This\r\nhappened at the time, when this country was as yet subject to Sweden.\r\nBut the Dutch crept in, and intended by degrees to dispossess the\r\nSwedes, as a people who had taken possession of their property. They\r\nsucceeded in their attempt; for the Swedes not being able to bear with\r\nthis encroachment, came to a war, in which the Dutch got the better.\r\nBut they did not enjoy the fruits of their victory long: for a few\r\nyears after, the English came and deprived them of their acquisition,\r\nand have ever since continued in the undisturbed possession of the\r\ncountry. Somewhat later at night we cast anchor, the pilot not\r\nventuring to carry the ship up the river in the dark, several sands\r\nbeing in the way.\r\n\r\nSeptember 15th. In the dawn of the morning we weighed anchor, and\r\ncontinued our voyage up the river. The country was inhabited almost\r\nevery where on both sides. The farm-houses were however pretty far\r\nasunder. About eight o’clock in the morning we sailed by the little\r\ntown of Chester, on the western side of the river. In this town, our\r\nmate, who was born in Philadelphia, shewed me the places, which the\r\nSwedes still inhabit.\r\n\r\nAt last we arrived in Philadelphia about ten o’Clock in the morning. We\r\nhad not been more than six weeks, or (to speak more accurately) not\r\nquite forty one days on our voyage from Gravesend to this place,\r\nincluding the time we spent at Deal, in supplying ourselves with the\r\nnecessary fresh provisions, &c. our voyage was therefore reckoned one\r\nof the shortest. For it is common in winter time to be fourteen,\r\nnineteen, or more weeks in coming from Gravesend to Philadelphia.\r\nHardly any body ever had a more pleasant voyage over this great ocean,\r\nthan we had. Captain Lawson affirmed this several times. Nay he assured\r\nus he had never seen such calm weather in this ocean, though he had\r\ncrossed it very often. The wind was generally so favourable that a boat\r\nof a middling size might have sailed in perfect safety. The sea never\r\nwent over our cabin, and but once over the deck, and that was only in a\r\nswell. The weather indeed was so clear, that a great number of the\r\nGermans on board slept on the deck. The cabin windows needed not the\r\nshutters. All these are circumstances which show the uncommon goodness\r\nof the weather.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lawson’s civility increased the pleasure of the voyage. For he\r\nshewed me all the friendship, that he could have shewn to any of his\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were come to the town, and had cast anchor, many of the\r\ninhabitants came on board, to enquire for Letters. They took all those\r\nwhich they could carry, either for themselves or for their friends.\r\nThose, which remained, the captain ordered to be carried on shore, and\r\nto be brought into a coffee-house, where every body could make enquiry\r\nfor them, and by this means he was rid of the trouble of delivering\r\nthem himself. I afterwards went on shore with him. But before he went,\r\nhe strictly charged the second mate, to let no one of the German\r\nrefugees out of the ship, unless he paid for his passage, or some body\r\nelse paid for him, or bought him.\r\n\r\nOn my leaving London I received letters of recommendation from Mr.\r\nAbraham Spalding, Mr. Peter Collinson, Dr. Mitchel, and others to their\r\nfriends here. It was easy for me therefore to get acquaintance. Mr.\r\nBenjamin Franklin, to whom Pensylvania is indebted for its welfare, and\r\nthe learned world for many new discoveries in Electricity, was the\r\nfirst, who took notice of me, and introduced me to many of his friends.\r\nHe gave me all necessary instructions, and shewed me his kindness on\r\nmany occasions.\r\n\r\nI went to day accompanied by Mr. Jacob Bengtson, a member of the\r\nSwedish consistory and the sculptor Gustavus Hesselius, to see the town\r\nand the fields which lay before it. (The former is brother of the rev.\r\nMessrs. Andrew and Samuel Hesselius, both ministers at Christiana in\r\nnew Sweden, and of the late Dr. John Hesselius in the provinces of\r\nNerik and Wermeland). My new friend had followed his brother Andrew in\r\n1711 to this country, and had since lived in it. I found that I was now\r\ncome into a new world. Whenever I looked to the ground, I every where\r\nfound such plants as I had never seen before. When I saw a tree, I was\r\nforced to stop, and ask those who accompanied me, how it was called.\r\nThe first plant which struck my eyes was an Andropogon, or a kind of\r\ngrass, and grass is a part of Botany I always delighted in. I was\r\nseized with terror at the thought of ranging so many new and unknown\r\nparts of natural history. At first I only considered the plants,\r\nwithout venturing a more accurate examination.\r\n\r\nAt night I took up my lodging with a grocer who was a quaker, and I met\r\nwith very good honest people in this house, such as most people of this\r\nprofession appeared to me, I and my Yungstrœm, the companion of my\r\nvoyage, had a room, candles, beds, attendance, and three meals a day,\r\nif we chose to have so many, for twenty shillings per week in\r\nPensylvania currency. But wood, washing and wine, if required, were to\r\nbe paid for besides.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 16th. Before I proceed I must give a short description of\r\nPhiladelphia, which I shall frequently mention in the sequel of my\r\ntravels. I here put down several particulars which I marked during my\r\nstay at that place, as a help to memory.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, the capital of Pensylvania, a province which makes part\r\nof what formerly was called New Sweden is one of the principal towns in\r\nNorth-America; and next to Boston the greatest. It is situated almost\r\nin the center of the English colonies, and its lat. is thirty nine deg.\r\nand fifty min. but its west long. from London near seventy five deg.\r\n\r\nThis town was built in the year 1683, or as others say in 1682, by the\r\nwell known quaker William Pen, who got this whole province by a grant\r\nfrom Charles the second, king of England; after Sweden had given up its\r\nclaims to it. According to Pen’s plan the town was to have been built\r\nupon a piece of land which is formed by the union of the rivers\r\nDelaware and Skulkill, in a quadrangular form, two English miles long\r\nand one broad. The eastern side would therefore have been bounded by\r\nthe Delaware, and the western by the Skulkill. They had actually begun\r\nto build houses on both these rivers; for eight capital streets, each\r\ntwo English miles long, and sixteen lesser streets (or lanes) across\r\nthem, each one mile in length, were marked out, with a considerable\r\nbreadth, and in strait lines. The place was at that time almost an\r\nentire wilderness covered with thick forests, and belonged to three\r\nSwedish brothers called Sven’s-Sœner (Sons of Sven) who had settled in\r\nit. They with difficulty left the place, the situation of which was\r\nvery advantageous, But at last they were persuaded to it by Pen, who\r\ngave them a few English miles from that place twice the space of\r\ncountry they inhabited. However Pen himself and his descendants after\r\nhim, have considerably lessened the ground belonging to them, by\r\nrepeated mensurations, under pretence that they had taken more than\r\nthey ought.\r\n\r\nBut the inhabitants could not be got in sufficient number to fill a\r\nplace of such extent. The plan therefore about the river Skulkill was\r\nlaid aside till more favourable circumstances should occur, and the\r\nhouses were only built along the Delaware. This river flows along the\r\neastern side of the town, is of great advantage to its trade, and gives\r\na fine prospect. The houses which had already been built upon the\r\nSkulkill were transplanted hitherto by degrees. This town accordingly\r\nlies in a very pleasant country, from north to south along the river.\r\nIt measures somewhat more than an English mile in length; and its\r\nbreadth in some places is half a mile or more. The ground is flat and\r\nconsists of sand mixed with a little clay. Experience has shewn that\r\nthe air of this place is very healthy.\r\n\r\nThe streets are regular, fine, and most of them are fifty foot, English\r\nmeasure, broad; Arch-street measures sixty six feet in breadth, and\r\nMarket-street or the principal street, where the market is kept, near a\r\nhundred. Those which run longitudinally, or from north to south are\r\nseven, exclusive of a little one, which runs along the river, to the\r\nsouth of the market, and is called Water-street. The lanes which go\r\nacross, and were intended to reach from the Delaware to the Skulkill,\r\nare eight in number. They do not go quite from east to west, but\r\ndeviate a little from that direction. All the streets except two which\r\nare nearest to the river, run in a straight line, and make right angles\r\nat the intersections. Some are paved, others are not; and it seems less\r\nnecessary since the ground is sandy, and therefore soon absorbs the\r\nwet. But in most of the streets is a pavement of flags, a fathom or\r\nmore broad, laid before the houses, and posts put on the outside three\r\nor four fathom asunder. Under the roofs are gutters which are carefully\r\nconnected with pipes, and by this means, those who walk under them,\r\nwhen it rains, or when the snow melts, need not fear being wetted by\r\nthe dropping from the roofs.\r\n\r\nThe houses make a good appearance, are frequency several stories high,\r\nand built either of bricks or of stone; but the former are more\r\ncommonly used, since bricks are made before the town, and are well\r\nburnt. The stone which has been employed in the building of other\r\nhouses, is a mixture of black or grey glimmer, running in undulated\r\nveins, and of a loose, and quite small grained limestone, which run\r\nscattered between the bendings of the other veins, and are of a grey\r\ncolour, excepting here and there some single grains of sand, of a paler\r\nhue. The glimmer makes the greatest part of the stone; but the mixture\r\nis sometimes of another kind, as I shall relate hereafter under the\r\narticle, eleventh of October. This stone is now got in great quantities\r\nin the country, is easily cut, and has the good quality of not\r\nattracting the moisture in a wet season. Very good lime is burnt every\r\nwhere hereabouts, for masonry.\r\n\r\nThe houses are covered with shingles. The wood for this purpose is\r\ntaken from the Cupressus thyoides, Linn. or a tree which Swedes here\r\ncall the white juniper-tree, and the English, the white cedar. Swamps\r\nand Morasses formerly were full of them, but at present these trees are\r\nfor the greatest part cut down, and no attempt has as yet been made to\r\nplant new ones. The wood is very light, rots less than any other in\r\nthis country, and for that reason is exceeding good for roofs. For it\r\nis not too heavy for the walls, and will serve for forty or fifty years\r\ntogether. But many people already begin to fear, that these roofs will\r\nin time be looked upon as having been very detrimental to the city. For\r\nbeing so very light, most people who have built their houses of stone,\r\nor bricks, have been led to make their walls extremely thin. But at\r\npresent this kind of wood is almost entirely destroyed. Whenever\r\ntherefore in process of time these roofs decay, the people will be\r\nobliged to have recourse to the heavier materials of tiles, or the\r\nlike, which the walls will not be strong enough to bear. The roof will\r\ntherefore require supports, or the people be obliged to pull down the\r\nwalls and to build new ones, or to take other steps for securing them.\r\nSeveral people have already in late years begun to make roofs of tiles.\r\n\r\nAmong the publick buildings I will first mention churches, of which\r\nthere are several, for God is served in various ways in this country.\r\n\r\n1. The English established church stands in the northern part of the\r\ntown, at some distance from the market, and is the finest of all. It\r\nhas a little, inconsiderable steeple, in which is a bell to be rung\r\nwhen it is time to go to church, and on burials. It has likewise a\r\nclock which strikes the hours. This building which is called Christ\r\nchurch, was founded towards the end of the last century, but has lately\r\nbeen rebuilt and more adorned. It has two ministers who get the\r\ngreatest part of their salary from England. In the beginning of this\r\ncentury, the Swedish minister the Rev. Mr. Rudmann, performed the\r\nfunctions of a clergyman to the English congregation for near two\r\nyears, during the absence of their own clergyman.\r\n\r\n2. The Swedish church, which is otherwise called the church of\r\nWeekacko, is on the southern part of the town, and almost without it,\r\non the river’s side, and its situation is therefore more agreeable than\r\nthat of any other. I shall have an opportunity of describing it more\r\nexactly, when I shall speak of the Swedes in particular, who live in\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n3. The German Lutheran church, is on the north-west side of the town.\r\nOn my arrival in America it had a little steeple, but that being but up\r\nby an ignorant architect, before the walls of the church were quite\r\ndry, they leaned forwards by its weight, and therefore they were forced\r\nto pull it down again in the autumn of the year 1750. About that time\r\nthe congregation received a fine organ from Germany. They have only one\r\nminister, who likewise preaches at another Lutheran church in\r\nGermantown. He preaches alternately one sunday in that church, and\r\nanother in this. The first clergyman which the Lutherans had in this\r\ntown, was the Rev. Mr. Muhlenberg, who laid the foundations of this\r\nchurch in 1743, and being called to another place afterwards, the rev.\r\nMr. Brunholz from Sleswick was his successor, and is yet here. Both\r\nthese gentlemen were sent to this place from Hall in Saxony, and have\r\nbeen a great advantage to it by their peculiar talent of preaching in\r\nan edifying manner. A little while before this church was built, the\r\nLutheran Germans had no clergyman for themselves, so that the\r\nevery-where beloved Swedish minister at Weekacko, Mr. Dylander,\r\npreached likewise to them. He therefore preached three sermons every\r\nsunday; the first early in the morning to the Germans; the second to\r\nthe Swedes, and the third in the afternoon to the English, and besides\r\nthis he went all the week into the country and instructed the Germans\r\nwho lived separately there. He therefore frequently preached sixteen\r\nsermons a week. And after his death, which happened in November 1741,\r\nthe Germans first wrote to Germany for a clergyman for themselves. This\r\ncongregation is at present very numerous, so that every sunday the\r\nchurch is very much crowded. It has two galleries, but no vestry. They\r\ndo not sing the collects, but read them before the altar.\r\n\r\n4. The old Presbyterian church, is not far from the market, and on the\r\nsouth-side of market-street. It is of a middling size, and built in the\r\nyear 1704, as the inscription on the northern pediment shews. The roof\r\nis built almost hemispherical, or at least forms a hexagon. The whole\r\nbuilding stands from north to south, for the presbyterians do not\r\nregard, as other people do, whether their churches look towards a\r\ncertain point of the heavens or not.\r\n\r\n5. The new Presbyterian church was built in the year 1750, by the\r\nNew-lights in the north-western part of the town. By the name of\r\nNew-lights, are understood the people who have, from different\r\nreligions, become proselytes to the well known Whitefield, who in the\r\nyears 1739, 1740, and likewise in 1744 and 1745 travelled through\r\nalmost all the English colonies. His delivery, his extraordinary zeal,\r\nand other talents so well adapted to the intelects of his hearers, made\r\nhim so popular that he frequently, especially in the two first years,\r\ngot from eight thousand to twenty thousand hearers in the fields. His\r\nintention in these travels, was to collect money for an orphans\r\nhospital which had been erected in Georgia. He here frequently\r\ncollected seventy pounds sterling at one sermon; nay, at two sermons\r\nwhich he preached in the year 1740, both an one sunday, at\r\nPhiladelphia, he got an hundred and fifty pounds. The proselytes of\r\nthis man, or the above-mentioned new-lights, are at present merely a\r\nsect of presbyterians. For though Whitefield was originally a clergyman\r\nof the English church, yet he deviated by little and little from her\r\ndoctrines; and on arriving in the year 1744 at Boston in New England,\r\nhe disputed with the Presbyterians about their doctrines, so much that\r\nhe almost entirely embraced them. For Whitefield was no great\r\ndisputant, and could therefore easily be led by these cunning people,\r\nwhithersoever they would have him. This likewise during his latter stay\r\nin America caused his audience to be less numerous than during the\r\nfirst. The new-lights built first in the year 1741, a great house in\r\nthe western part of the town, to hold divine service in. But a division\r\narising amongst them after the departure of Whitefield, and besides on\r\nother accounts, the building was sold to the town in the beginning of\r\nthe year 1750, and destined for a school. The new-lights then built a\r\nchurch which I call the new Presbyterian one. On its eastern pediment\r\nis the following inscription, in golden letters: Templum\r\nPresbyterianum, annuente numine, erectum, Anno Dom. MDCCL.\r\n\r\n6. The old German reformed church is built in the west north-west part\r\nof the town, and looks like the church in the Ladugoordfield near\r\nStockholm. It is not yet finished, though for several years together,\r\nthe congregation has kept up divine service in it. These Germans\r\nattended the German service at the Swedish church, whilst the Swedish\r\nminister Mr. Dylander lived.—But as the Lutherans got a clergyman for\r\nthemselves on the death of the last, those of the reformed church made\r\nlikewise preparations to get one from Dordrecht; and the first who was\r\nsent to them, was the Rev. Mr. Slaughter, whom I found on my arrival.\r\nBut in the year 1750, another clergyman of the reformed church arrived\r\nfrom Holland, and by his artful behaviour, so insinuated himself into\r\nthe favour of the Rev. Mr. Slaughter’s congregation, that the latter\r\nlost almost half his audience. The two clergymen then disputed for\r\nseveral sundays together, about the pulpit, nay, people relate that the\r\nnew comer mounted the pulpit on a saturday, and stayed in it all night.\r\nThe other being thus excluded, the two parties in the audience, made\r\nthemselves the subject both of the laughter and of the scorn of the\r\nwhole town, by beating and bruising each other, and committing other\r\nexcesses. The affair was inquired into by the magistrates, and decided\r\nin favour of the rev. Mr. Slaughter, the person who had been abused.\r\n\r\n7. The new reformed church, was built at a little distance from the old\r\none by the party of the clergyman, who had lost his cause. This man\r\nhowever had influence enough to bring over to his party almost the\r\nwhole audience of his antagonist, at the end of the year 1750, and\r\ntherefore this new church will soon be useless.\r\n\r\n8. 9. The Quakers have two meetings, one in the market, and the other\r\nin the northern part of the town. In them are according to the custom\r\nof this people, neither altars, nor pulpits, nor any other ornaments\r\nusual in churches; but only seats and some sconces. They meet thrice\r\nevery sunday in them, and besides that at certain times every week or\r\nevery month. I shall mention more about them hereafter.\r\n\r\n10. The Baptists, have their service, in the northern part of the town.\r\n\r\n11. The Roman Catholicks, have in the south-west part of the town a\r\ngreat house, which is well adorned within, and has an organ.\r\n\r\n12. The Moravian Brethren, have hired a great house, in the northern\r\npart of the town, in which they performed the service both in German\r\nand in English; not only twice or three times every sunday, but\r\nlikewise every night after it was grown dark. But in the winter of the\r\nyear 1750, they were obliged to drop their evening meetings; some\r\nwanton young fellows having several times disturbed the congregation,\r\nby an instrument sounding like the note of a cuckoo, for this noise\r\nthey made in a dark corner, not only at the end of every stanza, but\r\nlikewise at that of every line, whilst they were singing a hymn.\r\n\r\nThose of the English church, the New-lights, the Quakers, and the\r\nGermans of the reformed religion, have each of them their burying\r\nplaces on one side out of town, and not near their churches, though the\r\nfirst of these sometimes make an exception. All the others bury their\r\ndead in their church-yards, and Moravian brethren bury where they can.\r\nThe Negroes are buried in a particular place out of town.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to mention the other publick buildings in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Town-hall, or the place where the assemblies are held, is situated\r\nin the western part of the town, it is a fine large building, having a\r\ntower with a bell in the middle, and is the greatest ornament to the\r\ntown. The deputies of each province meet in it commonly every October,\r\nor even more frequently if circumstances require it, in order to\r\nconsider of the welfare of the country, and to hold their parliaments\r\nor diets in miniature. There they revise the old laws, and make new\r\nones.\r\n\r\nOn one side of this building stands the Library, which was first begun\r\nin the year 1742, on a publick spirited plan, formed and put in\r\nexecution by the learned Mr. Franklin. For he persuaded first the most\r\nsubstantial people in town to pay forty shillings at the outset, and\r\nafterwards annually ten shillings, all in Pensylvania currency, towards\r\npurchasing all kinds of useful books. The subscribers are entitled to\r\nmake use of the books. Other people are likewise at liberty to borrow\r\nthem for a certain time, but must leave a pledge and pay eight-pence a\r\nweek for a folio volume, six-pence for a quarto, and four-pence for all\r\nothers of a smaller size. As soon as the time, allowed a person for the\r\nperusal of the volume, is elapsed, it must be returned, or he is fined.\r\nThe money arising in this manner is employed for the salary of the\r\nlibrarian, and for purchasing new books. There was already a fine\r\ncollection of excellent works, most of them English; many French and\r\nLatin, but few in any other language. The subscribers were so kind to\r\nme, as to order the librarian, during my stay here, to lend me every\r\nbook, which I should want, without requiring any payment of me. The\r\nlibrary was open every saturday from four to eight o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. Besides the books, several mathematical and physical\r\ninstruments, and a large collection of natural curiosities were to be\r\nseen in it. Several little libraries were founded in the town on the\r\nsame footing or nearly with this.\r\n\r\nThe Court House stands in the middle of Market street, to the west of\r\nthe market, it is fine building, with a little tower in which there is\r\na bell. Below and round about this building the market is properly kept\r\nevery week.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Academy, is in the western part of the town. It was\r\nformerly as I have before mentioned, a meeting-house of the followers\r\nof Whitefield, but they sold it in the year 1750, and it was destined\r\nto be the seat of an university, or to express myself in more exact\r\nterms, to be a college, it was therefore fitted up to this purpose. The\r\nyouths are here only taught those things which they learn in our common\r\nschools; but in time, such lectures are intended to be read here, as\r\nare usual in real universities.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last war, a redoubt was erected here, on the south\r\nside of the town, near the river, to prevent the French and Spanish\r\nprivateers from landing. But this was done after a very strong debate.\r\nFor the quakers opposed all fortifications, as contrary to the tenets\r\nof their religion, which allow not christians to make war either\r\noffensive or defensive, but direct them to place their trust in the\r\nAlmighty alone. Several papers were then handed about for and against\r\nthe opinion. But the enemy’s privateers having taken several vessels\r\nbelonging to the town, in the river, many of the quakers, if not all of\r\nthem, found it reasonable to forward the building of the fortification\r\nas much as possible, at least by a supply of money.\r\n\r\nOf all the natural advantages of the town, its temperate climate is the\r\nmost considerable, the winter not being over severe, and its duration\r\nbut short, and the summer not too hot; the country round about bringing\r\nforth those fruits in the greatest plenty, which are raised by\r\nhusbandry. Their September and October are like the beginning of the\r\nSwedish August. And the first days in their February are frequently as\r\npleasant, as the end of April and the beginning of May in Sweden. Even\r\ntheir coldest days in some winters have been no severer, than the days\r\nat the end of autumn are in the middlemost parts of Sweden, and the\r\nsouthern ones of Finland.\r\n\r\nThe good and clear water in Philadelphia, is likewise one of its\r\nadvantages. For though there are no fountains in the town, yet there is\r\na well in every house, and several in the streets, all which afford\r\nexcellent water for boiling, drinking, washing, and other uses. The\r\nwater is commonly met with at the depth of forty feet. The water of the\r\nriver Delaware is likewise good. But in making the wells, a fault is\r\nfrequently committed, which in several places of the town, spoils the\r\nwater which is naturally good; I shall in the sequel take an\r\nopportunity of speaking further about it.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware is exceeding convenient for trade. It is one of the\r\ngreatest rivers in the world: is three English miles broad at its\r\nmouth, two miles at the town of Wilmington, and three quarters of a\r\nmile at Philadelphia. This city lies within ninety or an hundred\r\nEnglish miles from the sea, or from the place where the river Delaware\r\ndischarges itself into the bay of that name. Yet its depth is hardly\r\never less than five or six fathom. The greatest ships therefore can\r\nsail quite up to the town and anchor in good ground in five fathoms of\r\nwater, on the side of the bridge. The water here has no longer a\r\nsaltish taste, and therefore all destructive worms, which have fastened\r\nthemselves to the ships in the sea, and have pierced holes into them,\r\neither die, or drop off, after the ship has been here for a while.\r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage which trade labours under here, is the freezing\r\nof the river almost every winter for a month or more. For during that\r\ntime the navigation is entirely stopped. But this does not happen at\r\nBoston, New York, and other towns which are nearer the sea.\r\n\r\nThe tide comes up to Philadelphia, and even goes thirty miles higher,\r\nto Trenton. The difference between high and low water is eight feet at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThe cataracts of the Delaware near Trenton, and of the Skulkill at some\r\ndistance from Philadelphia, make these rivers useless further up the\r\ncountry, in regard to the conveyance of goods either from or to\r\nPhiladelphia. Both must therefore be carried on waggons or carts. It\r\nhas therefore already been thought of to make these two rivers\r\nnavigable in time, at least for large boats and small vessels.\r\n\r\nSeveral ships are annually built of American oak, in the docks which\r\nare made in several parts of the town and about it, yet they can by no\r\nmeans be put in comparison with those built of European oak, in point\r\nof goodness and duration.\r\n\r\nThe town carries on a great trade, both with the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry, and to other parts of the world, especially to the West\r\nIndies, South America, and the Antilles; to England, Ireland, Portugal,\r\nand to several English colonies in North America. Yet none but English\r\nships are allowed to come into this port.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia reaps the greatest profits from its trade to the West\r\nIndies. For thither the inhabitants ship almost every day a quantity of\r\nflour, butter, flesh and other victuals; timber, plank and the like. In\r\nreturn they receive either sugar, molasses, rum, indigo, mahogany, and\r\nother goods, or ready money. The true mahogany which grows in Jamaica,\r\nis at present almost all cut down.\r\n\r\nThey send both West India goods, and their own productions to England;\r\nthe latter are all sorts of woods, especially black walnut, and oak\r\nplanks for ships; ships ready built, iron, hides and tar. Yet this\r\nlatter is properly bought in New Jersey, the forests of which province\r\nare consequently more ruined than any others. Ready money is likewise\r\nsent over to England, from whence in return they get all sorts of goods\r\nthere manufactured, viz. fine and coarse cloth, linen, iron ware, and\r\nother wrought metals, and East India goods. For it is to be observed\r\nthat England supplies Philadelphia with almost all stuffs and\r\nmanufactured goods which are wanted here.\r\n\r\nA great quantity of linseed goes annually to Ireland, together with\r\nmany of the ships which are built here. Portugal gets wheat, corn,\r\nflour and maize which is not ground. Spain sometimes takes some corn.\r\nBut all the money, which is got in these several countries, must\r\nimmediately be sent to England, in payment for the goods which are got\r\nfrom thence, and yet those sums are not sufficient to pay all the\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\nBut to shew more exactly, what the town and province have imported from\r\nEngland, in different years, I shall here insert an extract from the\r\nEnglish custom-house books, which I got from the engineer, Lewis Evans,\r\nat Philadelphia, and which will sufficiently answer the purpose. This\r\ngentleman had desired one of his friends in London to send him a\r\ncompleat account of all the goods shipped from England to Pensylvania\r\nin several years. He got this account, and though the goods are not\r\nenumerated in it, yet their value in money is calculated. Such extracts\r\nfrom the custom-house books have been made for every North-American\r\nprovince, in order to convince the English parliament, that those\r\nprovinces have taken greater quantities of the goods in that kingdom,\r\never since they have turned their money into bills.\r\n\r\nI have taken the copy from the original itself, and it is to be\r\nobserved that it begins with the christmas of the year 1722, and ends\r\nabout the same time of the year 1747. In the first column is the value\r\nof the foreign goods, the duty for which has already been paid in\r\nEngland. The second column shews the value of the goods manufactured in\r\nEngland and exported to Pensylvania. And in the last column these two\r\nsums are added together, but at the bottom each of the columns is cast\r\nup.\r\n\r\nBut this table does not include the goods which are annually shipped in\r\ngreat quantities to Pensylvania from Scotland and Ireland, among which\r\nis a great quantity of linen.\r\n\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|          The Value of the Goods annually shipped from           |\r\n|                     England to Pensylvania.                     |\r\n+---------+-------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n|The Year,|Foreign Goods for  |                |The Sums of these |\r\n|from one |which the duty has | English        |two preceding     |\r\n|Christmas|already been paid, | manufactured   |columns added     |\r\n|    to   |& which therefore  | Goods.         |together.         |\r\n| another.|only req. receipts.|                |                  |\r\n+---------+-------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n|         |  l.     s.     d. |   l.    s.  d. |   l.    s.    d. |\r\n|  1723   | 5199 |  13 |   5  | 10793|  5 | 1  | 15992 | 19 |  4  |\r\n|  1724   | 9373 |  15 |   8  | 20951|  0 | 5  | 30324 | 16 |  1  |\r\n|  1725   |10301 |  12 |   6  | 31508|  1 | 8  | 42209 | 14 |  2  |\r\n|  1726   | 9371 |  11 |   6  | 28263|  6 | 2  | 37634 | 17 |  8  |\r\n|  1727   |10243 |   0 |   7  | 21736| 10 | 0  | 31979 | 10 |  7  |\r\n|  1728   |14073 |  13 |   3  | 23405|  6 | 2  | 37478 | 19 | 11  |\r\n|  1729   |12948 |   8 |   5  | 16851|  2 | 5  | 29799 | 10 | 10  |\r\n|  1730   |15660 |  10 |  11  | 32931| 16 | 6  | 48592 |  7 |  5  |\r\n|  1731   |11838 |  17 |   4  | 32421| 18 | 9  | 44260 | 16 |  1  |\r\n|  1732   |15240 |  14 |   4  | 26457| 19 | 3  | 41698 | 13 |  7  |\r\n|  1733   |13187 |   0 |   8  | 27378|  7 | 5  | 40585 |  8 |  1  |\r\n|  1734   |19648 |  15 |   9  | 34743| 12 | 1  | 54392 |  7 | 10  |\r\n|  1735   |18078 |   4 |   3  | 30726|  7 | 1  | 48804 | 11 |  4  |\r\n|  1736   |23456 |  15 |  11  | 38057|  2 | 5  | 61513 | 18 |  4  |\r\n|  1737   |14517 |   4 |   3  | 42173|  2 | 4  | 56690 |  6 |  7  |\r\n|  1738   |20320 |  19 |   3  | 41129|  5 | 0  | 61450 |  4 |  3  |\r\n|  1739   | 9041 |   4 |   5  | 45411|  7 | 6  | 54452 | 11 | 11  |\r\n|  1740   |10280 |   2 |   0  | 46471| 12 | 9  | 56751 | 14 |  9  |\r\n|  1741   |12977 |  18 |  10  | 78032| 13 | 1  | 91010 | 11 | 11  |\r\n|  1742   |14458 |   6 |   3  | 60836| 17 | 1  | 75295 |  3 |  4  |\r\n|  1743   |19220 |   1 |   6  | 60120|  4 |10  | 79340 |  6 |  4  |\r\n|  1744   |14681 |   8 |   4  | 47595| 18 | 2  | 62214 |  6 |  6  |\r\n|  1745   |13043 |   8 |   8  | 41237|  2 | 3  | 54280 | 10 | 11  |\r\n|  1746   |18103 |  12 |   7  | 55595| 19 | 7  | 73699 | 12 |  2  |\r\n|  1747   | 8585 |  14 |  11  | 73819|  2 | 8  | 82404 | 17 |  7  |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|  Total. 343,789   16     0  969,049   1   6  1,312,838 17    6  |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole extent of the Philadelphia trade may be comprehended from the\r\nnumber of ships, which annually arrive at and sail from this town. I\r\nintend to insert here a table of a few years which I have taken from\r\nthe gazettes of the town. The ships coming and going in one year, are\r\nto be reckoned from the twenty fifth of March of that year, to the\r\ntwenty fifth of March of the next.\r\n\r\n\r\n               The Year.   Ships arrived.   Ships sailed.\r\n\r\n                1735              199             212\r\n                1740              307             208\r\n                1741              292             309\r\n                1744              229             271\r\n                1745              280             301\r\n                1746              273             293\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is much to be feared that the trade of Philadelphia, and of all\r\nthe English colonies, will rather decrease than encrease, in case no\r\nprovision is made to prevent it. I shall hereafter plainly shew upon\r\nwhat foundation this decrease of trade is likely to take place.\r\n\r\nThe town not only furnishes most of the inhabitants of Pensylvania with\r\nthe goods which they want, but numbers of the inhabitants of New Jersey\r\ncome every day and carry on a great trade.\r\n\r\nThe town has two great fairs every year; one in May, and the other in\r\nNovember, both on the sixteenth days of those two months. But besides\r\nthese fairs, there are every week two market days, viz. Wednesday and\r\nSaturday. On those days the country people in Pensylvania and New\r\nJersey, bring to town a quantity of victuals, and other productions of\r\nthe country, and this is a great advantage to the town. It is therefore\r\nto be wished that the like regulation might be made in our Swedish\r\ntowns. You are sure to meet with every produce of the season, which the\r\ncountry affords, on the market-days. But on other days, they are in\r\nvain sought for.\r\n\r\nProvisions are always to be got fresh here, and for that reason most of\r\nthe inhabitants never buy more at a time, than what will be sufficient\r\ntill the next market-day. In summer there is a market almost every day;\r\nfor the victuals do not keep well in the great heat. There are two\r\nplaces in the town where these markets are kept; but that near the\r\ncourt-house is the principal. It begins about four or five o’clock in\r\nthe morning, and ends about nine o’clock in the forenoon.\r\n\r\nThe town is not enclosed, and has no other custom-house than the great\r\none for the ships.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the whole province lives here; and though he is\r\nnominated by the heirs of Pen, yet he cannot take that office without\r\nbeing confirmed by the king of England.\r\n\r\nThe quakers of almost all parts of North-America, have their great\r\nassembly here once a year.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1743, a society for the advancement of the sciences was\r\nerected here. Its objects would have been the curiosities of the three\r\nkingdoms of nature, mathematicks, physick, chemistry, œconomy, and\r\nmanufactures. But the war, which ensued immediately, stopped all\r\ndesigns of this nature, and since that time, nothing has been done\r\ntowards establishing any thing of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe declination of the needle was here observed on the thirtieth of\r\nOctober 1750, old style, to be five deg. and forty-five min. west. It\r\nwas examined by the new meridian, which was drawn at Philadelphia in\r\nthe autumn of the same year, and extended a mile in length. By\r\nexperience it appears, that this declination lessens about a degree in\r\ntwenty years time.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difference in the rising and falling of the barometer, is\r\naccording to the observations made for several years together by Mr.\r\nJames Logan, found at 28´´ 59 and 30´´ 78.\r\n\r\nHere are three printers, and every week two English, and one German\r\nnews-paper is printed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1732, on the fifth of September, old style, a little\r\nearthquake was felt here about noon, and at the same time at Boston in\r\nNew England, and at Montreal in Canada, which places are above sixty\r\nSwedish miles asunder.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November of the year 1737, the well known prince from\r\nmount Lebanon, Sheich Sidi came to Philadelphia, on his travels through\r\nmost of the English American colonies. And in the same year a second\r\nearthquake was felt about eleven o’clock at night, on the seventh of\r\nDecember. But it did not continue above half a minute, and yet, it was\r\nfelt according to the accounts of the gazettes at the same hour in\r\nNewcastle, New York, New London, Boston, and other towns of New\r\nEngland. It had therefore likewise reached several miles.\r\n\r\nThe count Sinzendorf [5] arrived here in the December of the year 1741,\r\nand continued till the next spring. His uncommon behaviour persuaded\r\nmany Englishmen of rank, that he was disordered in his head.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to find the exact number of the inhabitants of\r\nPhiladelphia. In the year 1746, they were reckoned above ten thousand,\r\nand since that time their number is incredibly encreased. Neither can\r\nit be made out from the Bills of mortality, since they are not kept\r\nregularly in all the churches. I shall, however, mention some of those\r\nwhich appeared either in the gazettes, or in bills printed on purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Year.   Dead.\r\n\r\n                             1730     227\r\n                             1738     250\r\n                             1739     350\r\n                             1740     290\r\n                             1741     345\r\n                             1742     409\r\n                             1743     425\r\n                             1744     410\r\n                             1745     420\r\n                             1748     672\r\n                             1749     758\r\n                             1750     716\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these bills of mortality it also appears, that the diseases which\r\nare the most fatal, are consumptions, fevers, convulsions, pleuresies,\r\nhæmorrhagies, and dropsies.\r\n\r\nThe number of those that are born cannot be determined, since in many\r\nchurches no order is observed with regard to this affair. The quakers,\r\nwho are the most numerous in this town, never baptize their children,\r\nthough they take a pretty exact account of all who are born among them.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise impossible to guess at the number of inhabitants from\r\nthe dead, because the town gets such great supplies annually from other\r\ncountries. In the summer of the year 1749, near twelve thousand Germans\r\ncame over to Philadelphia, many of whom staid in that town. In the same\r\nyear the houses in Philadelphia were counted, and found to be two\r\nthousand and seventy six in number.\r\n\r\nThe town is now quite filled with inhabitants, which in regard to their\r\ncountry, religion and trade, are very different from each other. You\r\nmeet with excellent masters in all trades, and many things are made\r\nhere full as well as in England. Yet no manufactures, especially for\r\nmaking fine cloth are established. Perhaps the reason is, that it can\r\nbe got with so little difficulty from England, and that the breed of\r\nsheep which is brought over, degenerates in process of time, and\r\naffords but a coarse wool.\r\n\r\nHere is great plenty of provisions, and their prices are very moderate.\r\nThere are no examples of an extraordinary dearth.\r\n\r\nEvery one who acknowledges God to be the Creator, preserver and ruler\r\nof all things, and teaches or undertakes nothing against the state, or\r\nagainst the common peace, is at liberty to settle, stay, and carry on\r\nhis trade here, be his religious principles ever so strange. No one is\r\nhere molested on account of the erroneous principles of the doctrine\r\nwhich he follows, if he does not exceed the above-mentioned bounds. And\r\nhe is so well secured by the laws in his person and property, and\r\nenjoys such liberties; that a citizen of Philadelphia may in a manner\r\nbe said to live in his house like a king.\r\n\r\nOn a careful consideration of what I have already said, it will be easy\r\nto conceive how this city should rise so suddenly from nothing, into\r\nsuch grandeur and perfection, without supposing any powerful monarch’s\r\ncontributing to it, either by punishing the wicked, or by giving great\r\nsupplies in money. And yet its fine appearance, good regulations,\r\nagreeable situation, natural advantages, trade, riches and power, are\r\nby no means inferior to those of any, even of the most ancient towns in\r\nEurope. It has not been necessary to force people to come and settle\r\nhere; on the contrary foreigners of different languages, have left\r\ntheir country, houses, property and relations, and ventured over wide\r\nand stormy seas, in order to come hither. Other countries, which have\r\nbeen peopled for a long space of time, complain of the small number of\r\ntheir inhabitants. But Pensylvania, which was no better than a desart\r\nin the year 1681, and hardly contained five hundred people, now vies\r\nwith several kingdoms in Europe, in number of inhabitants. It has\r\nreceived numbers of people which other countries, to their infinite\r\nloss, have either neglected or expelled.\r\n\r\nA wretched old wooden building, on a hill near the river somewhat north\r\nof the Wickako church, belonging to one of the Sons of Sven, of whom,\r\nas before-mentioned, the ground was bought for building Philadelphia\r\nupon, is preserved on purpose, as a memorial of the poor state of that\r\nplace, before the town was built on it. Its antiquity gives it a kind\r\nof superiority over all the other buildings in town, though in itself\r\nthe worst of all. This hut was inhabited, whilst as yet stags, deers,\r\nelks, and beavers, at broad day light lived in the future streets,\r\nchurch-yards, and market-places of Philadelphia. The noise of a\r\nspinning wheel was heard in this house, before the manufactures now\r\nestablished were thought of, or Philadelphia built. But with all these\r\nadvantages, this house is ready to fall down, and in a few years to\r\ncome, it will be as difficult to find the place where it stood, as it\r\nwas unlikely at the time of its erection, that one of the greatest\r\ntowns in America, should in a short time stand close up to it.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 7th. Mr. Peter Cock, a merchant of this town, assured me\r\nthat he had last week himself been a spectator of a snake’s swallowing\r\na little bird. This bird, which from its cry has the name of Cat bird,\r\n(Muscicapa Carolinensis, Linn.) flew from one branch of a tree to\r\nanother, and was making a doleful tune. At the bottom of the tree, but\r\nat a fathom’s distance from the stem, lay one of the great black\r\nsnakes, with its head continually upright, pointing towards the bird,\r\nwhich was always fluttering about, and now and then settling on the\r\nbranches. At first it only kept in the topmost branches, but by degrees\r\nit came lower down, and even flew upon the ground, and hopped to the\r\nplace where the snake lay, which immediately opened its mouth, caught\r\nthe bird and swallowed it; but it had scarce finished its repast before\r\nMr. Cock came up and killed it. I was afterwards told that this kind of\r\nsnakes was frequently observed to pursue little birds in this manner.\r\nIt is already well known that the rattle snake does the same.\r\n\r\nI walked out to day into the fields in order to get more acquainted\r\nwith the plants hereabouts, I found several European and even Swedish\r\nplants among them. But those which are peculiar to America, are much\r\nmore numerous.\r\n\r\nThe Virginian maple grows in plenty on the shores of the Delaware. The\r\nEnglish in this country call it either Buttonwood, or Waterbeech, which\r\nlatter name is most usual. The Swedes call it Wattenbok, or Wasbok. It\r\nis Linnæus’s Platanus occidentalis. See Catesby’s Nat. Hist. of\r\nCarolina, vol. 1. p. 56. t. 56. It grows for the greatest part in low\r\nplaces, but especially on the edge of rivers and brooks. But these\r\ntrees are easily transplanted to more dry places, if they be only\r\nfilled with good soil; and as their leaves are large and their foliage\r\nthick, they are planted about the houses and in gardens, to afford a\r\npleasant shade in the hot season, to the enjoyment of which some seats\r\nwere placed under them. Some of the Swedes had boxes, pails, and the\r\nlike, made of the bark of this tree by the native Americans. They say\r\nthat those people whilst they were yet settled here, made little dishes\r\nof this bark for gathering whortleberries. The bark was a line in\r\nthickness. This tree likewise grows in marshes, or in swampy fields,\r\nwhere ash and red maple commonly grow. They are frequently as tall and\r\nthick, as the best of our fir trees. The seed stays on them till\r\nspring, but in the middle of April the pods open and shed the seeds.\r\nQuery, Whether they are not ripe before that time, and consequently\r\nsooner fit for sowing? This American maple is remarkable for its quick\r\ngrowth, in which it exceeds all other trees. There are such numbers of\r\nthem on the low meadows between Philadelphia and the ferry at\r\nGloucester, on both sides of the road, that in summer time you go as it\r\nwere through a shady walk. In that part of Philadelphia which is near\r\nthe Swedish church, some great trees of this kind stand on the shore of\r\nthe river. In the year 1750, on the 15th. of May I saw the buds still\r\non them, and in the year 1749 they began to flower on the eighth of\r\nthat month. Several trees of this sort are planted at Chelsea near\r\nLondon, and they now in point of height vie with the tallest oak.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 18th. In the morning I went with the Swedish painter, Mr.\r\nHesselius, to the country seat of Mr. Bartram, which is about four\r\nEnglish miles to the south of Philadelphia, at some distance from the\r\nhigh road to Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina. I had therefore the\r\nfirst opportunity here, of getting an exact knowledge of the state of\r\nthe country, which was a plain covered with all kinds of trees with\r\ndeciduous leaves. The ground was sandy, mixed with clay. But the sand\r\nseemed to be in greater quantity. In some parts the wood was cut down,\r\nand we saw the habitations of some country people, whose corn-fields\r\nand plantations were round their farm-houses. The wood was full of\r\nmulberry-trees, walnut-trees of several kinds, chesnut-trees,\r\nsassafras, and the like. Several sorts of wild vines clasped their\r\ntendrils round, and climbed up to the summits of the highest trees; and\r\nin other places they twined round the enclosures, so thick, that the\r\nlatter almost sunk down under their weight. The Persimon, or Diospyros\r\nVirginiana, Linn. sp. pl. p. 1510, grew in the marshy fields, and about\r\nsprings. Its little apples looked very well already, but are not fit\r\nfor eating, before the frost has affected them, and then they have a\r\nvery fine taste. Hesselius gathered some of them, and desired my\r\nservant to taste of the fruits of the land; but this poor credulous\r\nfollow, had hardly bit into them, when he felt the qualities they have\r\nbefore the frost has penetrated them. For they contracted his mouth so\r\nthat he could hardly speak, and had a very disagreeable taste. This\r\ndisgusted him so much that he was with difficulty persuaded to taste of\r\nit during the whole of our stay in America, notwithstanding it loses\r\nall its acidity and acquires an agreeable flavour in autumn and towards\r\nthe beginning of winter. For the fellow always imagined, that though he\r\nshould eat them ever so late in the year, they would still retain the\r\nsame disagreeable taste.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the curiosity of those, who are willing to know, how the\r\nwoods look in this country, and whether or no the trees in them are the\r\nsame with those found in our forests, I here insert a small catalogue\r\nof those which grow spontaneously in the woods which are nearest to\r\nPhiladelphia. But I exclude such shrubs as do not attain any\r\nconsiderable height. I shall put that tree first in order, which is\r\nmost plentiful, and so on with the rest, and therefore trees which I\r\nhave found but single, though near the town, will be last.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. Quercus alba, the white oak in good ground.\r\n     2. Quercus rubra, or the black oak.\r\n     3. Quercus hispanica, the Spanish oak, a variety of the preceding.\r\n     4. Juglans alba, hiccory, a kind of walnut tree, of which three or\r\n        four varieties are to be met with.\r\n     5. Rubus occidentalis, or American blackberry shrub.\r\n     6. Acer rubrum, the maple tree with red flowers, in swamps.\r\n     7. Rhus glabra, the smooth leaved Sumach, in the woods, on high\r\n        glades, and old corn-fields.\r\n     8. Vitis labrusca and Vulpina, vines of several kinds.\r\n     9. Sambucus canadensis, American Elder tree, along the hedges and\r\n        on glades.\r\n    10. Quercus phellos, the swamp oak, in morasses.\r\n    11. Azalea lutea, the American upright honey-suckle, in the woods\r\n        in dry places.\r\n    12. Cratægus Crus galli, the Virginian Azarole, in woods.\r\n    13. Vaccinium ——, a species of whortleberry shrub.\r\n    14. Quercus prinus, the chesnut oak in good ground.\r\n    15. Cornus florida, the cornelian cherry, in all kinds of ground.\r\n    16. Liriodendron Tulipifera, the tulip tree, in every kind of soil.\r\n    17. Prunus virginiana, the wild cherry tree.\r\n    18. Vaccinium ——, a frutex whortleberry, in good ground.\r\n    19. Prinos verticillatus, the winterberry tree in swamps.\r\n    20. Platanus occidentalis, the water-beech.\r\n    21. Nyssa aquatica, the tupelo tree; on fields and mountains. [6]\r\n    22. Liquidambar styraciflua, sweet gum tree, near springs.\r\n    23.

Annona muricata, the custard apple in a fruitful soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe visited several Swedes, who were settled here, and were at present\r\nin very good circumstances. One of them was called Andrew Rambo; he had\r\na fine house built of stone, two stories high, and a great orchard near\r\nit. We were every where well received, and stayed over night with the\r\nabove-mentioned countryman. We saw no other marks of autumn, than that\r\nseveral fruits of this season were already ripe. For besides this all\r\nthe trees were yet as green, and the ground still as much covered with\r\nflowers, as in our summer. Thousands of frogs croaked all the night\r\nlong in the marshes and brooks. The locusts and grasshoppers made\r\nlikewise such a great noise, that it was hardly possible for one person\r\nto understand another. The trees too, were full of all sorts of birds,\r\nwhich by the variety of their fine plumage, delighted the eye, while\r\nthe infinite variety of their tunes were continually re-echoed.\r\n\r\nThe orchards, along which we passed to-day, were only enclosed by\r\nhurdles. But they contained all kinds of fine fruit. We wondered at\r\nfirst very much when our leader leaped over the hedge into the\r\norchards, and gathered some agreeable fruit for us. But our\r\nastonishment was still greater, when we saw that the people in the\r\ngarden were so little concerned at it, as not even to look at us. But\r\nour companion told us, that the people here were not so exact in regard\r\nto a few fruits, as they are in other countries where the soil is not\r\nso fruitful in them. We afterwards found very frequently that the\r\ncountry people in Sweden and Finland guarded their turneps more\r\ncarefully, than the people here do the most exquisite fruits.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 19th. As I walked this morning into the fields, I\r\nobserved that a copious dew was fallen; for the grass was as wet as if\r\nit had rained. The leaves of the plants and trees, had contracted so\r\nmuch moisture, that the drops ran down. I found on this occasion that\r\nthe dew was not only on the superior, but likewise on the inferior side\r\nof the leaves. I therefore carefully considered many leaves both of\r\ntrees and of other plants; both of those which are more above, and of\r\nthose which are nearer to the ground. But I found in all of them, that\r\nboth sides of the leaves were equally bedewed, except those of the\r\nVerbascum Thapsus, or great Mullein, which though their superior side\r\nwas pretty well covered with the dew, yet their inferior had but a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nEvery countryman, even a common peasant, has commonly an orchard near\r\nhis house, in which all sorts of fruit, such as peaches, apples, pears,\r\ncherries, and others, are in plenty. The peaches were now almost ripe.\r\nThey are rare in Europe, particularly in Sweden, for in that country\r\nhardly any people besides the rich taste them. But here every\r\ncountryman had an orchard full of peach trees, which were covered with\r\nsuch quantities of fruit, that we could scarcely walk in the orchard,\r\nwithout treading upon those peaches which were fallen off; many of\r\nwhich were always left on the ground, and only part of them was sold in\r\ntown, and the rest was consumed by the family and strangers; for every\r\none that passed by, was at liberty to go into the orchard, and to\r\ngather as many of them as he wanted. Nay, this fine fruit was\r\nfrequently given to the swine.\r\n\r\nThis fruit is however sometimes kept for winter use, and for this\r\npurpose they are prepared in the following manner. The fruit is cut\r\ninto four parts, the stone thrown away, and the fruit put upon a\r\nthread, on which they are exposed to the sunshine in the open air, till\r\nthey are sufficiently dry. They are then put into a vessel for winter.\r\nBut this manner of drying them is not very good, because the rain of\r\nthis season very easily spoils and putrifies them, whilst they hang in\r\nthe open air. For this reason a different method is followed by others,\r\nwhich is by far the most eligible. The peaches are as before cut into\r\nfour parts, are then either put upon a thread, or laid upon a board,\r\nand so hung up in the air when the sun shines. Being dried in some\r\nmeasure, or having lost their juice by this means, they are put into an\r\noven, out of which the bread has but just been taken, and are left in\r\nit for a while. But they are soon taken out and brought into the fresh\r\nair; and after that they are again put into the oven, and this is\r\nrepeated several times till they are as dry as they ought to be. For if\r\nthey were dried up at once in the oven, they would shrivel up too much,\r\nand lose part of their flavour. They are then put up and kept for the\r\nwinter. They are either baked into tarts and pyes, or boiled and\r\nprepared as dried apples and pears are in Sweden. Several people here\r\ndry and preserve their apples in the same manner as their peaches.\r\n\r\nThe peach trees, have, as I am told, been first planted here by the\r\nEuropeans. But at present they succeed very well, and require even less\r\ncare, than our apple and pear trees.\r\n\r\nThe orchards have seldom other fruit than apples and peaches. Pear\r\ntrees are scarce in this province, and those that had any of them, had\r\nplanted them in their orchards. They likewise have cherry trees in the\r\norchards, but commonly on the sides of them towards the house, or along\r\nthe enclosures. Mulberry trees are planted on some hillocks near the\r\nhouse, and sometimes even in the court yards of the house. The black\r\nwalnut trees, or Juglans nigra, grow partly on hills, and in fields\r\nnear the farm-houses, and partly along the enclosures; but most\r\ncommonly in the forests. No other trees of this kind, are made use of\r\nhere. The chesnuts are left in the fields; here and there is one in a\r\ndry field or in a wood.\r\n\r\nThe Hibiscus esculentus, or Okra, [9] is a plant which grows wild in\r\nthe West Indies, but is planted in the gardens here. The fruit, which\r\nis a long pod, is cut whilst it is green, and boiled in soups, which\r\nthereby become as thick as pulse. This dish is reckoned a dainty by\r\nsome people, and especially by the negroes.\r\n\r\nCapsicum annuum, or Guinea pepper is likewise planted in gardens. When\r\nthe fruit is ripe it is almost entirely red, it is put to a roasted or\r\nboiled piece of meat, a little of it being strewed upon it, or mixed\r\nwith the broth. Besides this, cucumbers are pickled with it. Or the\r\npods are pounded whilst they are yet tender, and being mixed with salt\r\nare preserved in a bottle; and this spice is strewed over roasted or\r\nboiled meat, or fried fish, and gives them a very fine taste. But the\r\nfruit by itself is as biting as common pepper.\r\n\r\nThis country contains many species of the plant, which Dr. Linnæus\r\ncalls Rhus, and the most common is the Rhus foliis pinnatis serratis\r\nlanceolates retrinque nudis, or the Rhus glabra. The English call this\r\nplant Sumach. But the Swedes here, have no particular name for it, and\r\ntherefore make use of the English name. Its berries or fruits are red.\r\nThey are made use of for dying, and afford a colour like their own.\r\nThis tree is like a weed in this country, for if a corn-field is left\r\nuncultivated for some few years together, it grows on it in plenty,\r\nsince the berries are spread every where by the birds. And when the\r\nground is to be ploughed the roots stop the plough very much. The fruit\r\nstays on the shrub during the whole winter. But the leaves drop very\r\nearly in autumn, after they are turned reddish, like those of our\r\nSwedish mountain ash. The branches boiled with the berries afford a\r\nblack ink like tincture. The boys eat the berries, there being no\r\ndanger of falling sick after the repast; but they are very sour. They\r\nseldom grow above three yards high. On cutting the stem, it appears\r\nthat it contains nothing but pith. I have cut several in this manner,\r\nand found that some were ten years old; but that most of them were\r\nabove one year old. When the cut is made, a yellow juice comes out\r\nbetween the bark and the wood. One or two of the most outward circles\r\nare white, but the innermost are of a yellowish green. It is easy to\r\ndistinguish them one from another. They contain a very plentiful pith,\r\nthe diameter of which is frequently half an inch, and sometimes more.\r\nIt is brown, and so loose that it is easily pushed out by a little\r\nstick, in the same manner as the pith of the elder tree, raspberry and\r\nblackberry bushes. This sumach grows near the enclosures, round the\r\ncorn-fields, but especially on fallow ground. The wood seemed to burn\r\nwell, and made no great crackling in the fire.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 20th. In the morning we walked in the fields and woods\r\nnear the town, partly for gathering seeds, and partly for gathering\r\nplants for my herbal, which was our principal occupation; and in the\r\nautumn of this year, we sent part of our collection to England and\r\nSweden.\r\n\r\nA species of Rhus, which was frequent in the marshes here was called\r\nthe poison tree by both English and Swedes. Some of the former gave it\r\nthe name of swamp-sumach, and my country-men gave it the same name. Dr.\r\nLinnæus in his botanical works calls it Rhus Vernix. Sp. pl. 1. 380.\r\nFlora Virgin. 45. An incision being made into the tree, a whitish\r\nyellow juice, which has a nauseous smell, comes out between the bark\r\nand the wood. This tree is not known for its good qualities, but\r\ngreatly so for the effect of its poison, which though it is noxious to\r\nsome people, yet does not in the least affect others. And therefore one\r\nperson can handle the tree as he pleases, cut it, peel off its bark,\r\nrub it, or the wood upon his hands, smell at it, spread the juice upon\r\nhis skin, and make more experiments, with no inconvenience to himself;\r\nanother person on the contrary dares not meddle with the tree, while\r\nits wood is fresh, nor can he venture to touch a hand which has handled\r\nit, nor even to expose himself to the smoak of a fire which is made\r\nwith this wood, without soon feeling its bad effects; for the face, the\r\nhands, and frequently the whole body swells excessively, and is\r\naffected with a very accute pain. Sometimes bladders or blisters arise\r\nin great plenty, and make the sick person look as if he was infected by\r\na leprosy. In some people the external thin skin, or cuticle, peels of\r\nin a few days, as is the case when a person has scalded or burnt any\r\npart of his body. Nay, the nature of some persons will not even allow\r\nthem to approach the place where the tree grows, or to expose\r\nthemselves to the wind, when it carries the effluvia or exhalations of\r\nthis tree with it, without letting them feel the inconvenience of the\r\nswelling, which I have just now described. Their eyes are sometimes\r\nshut up for one, or two and more days together by the swelling. I know\r\ntwo brothers, one of whom could without danger handle this tree in what\r\nmanner he pleased, whereas the other could not come near it without\r\nswelling. A person sometimes does not know that he has touched this\r\npoisonous plant, or that he has been near it, before his face and hands\r\nshews it by their swelling. I have known old people who were more\r\nafraid of this tree than of a viper; and I was acquainted with a person\r\nwho merely by the noxious exhalations of it was swelled to such a\r\ndegree, that he was as stiff as a log of wood, and could only be turned\r\nabout in sheets.\r\n\r\nOn relating in the winter of the year 1750, the poisonous qualities of\r\nthe swamp sumach to my Yungstrœm, who attended me on my travels, he\r\nonly laughed, and looked upon the whole as a fable, in which opinion he\r\nwas confirmed by his having often handled the tree the autumn before,\r\ncut many branches of it, which he had carried for a good while in his\r\nhand in order to preserve its seeds, and put many into the herbals, and\r\nall this, without feeling the least inconvenience. He would therefore,\r\nbeing a kind of philosopher in his own way, take nothing for granted of\r\nwhich he had no sufficient proofs, especially as he had his own\r\nexperience in the summer of the year 1749, to support the contrary\r\nopinion. But in the next summer his system of philosophy was\r\noverturned. For his hands swelled and he felt a violent pain, and\r\nitching in his eyes as soon as he touched the tree, and this\r\ninconvenience not only attended him when he meddled with this kind of\r\nsumach, but even when he had any thing to do with the Rhus radicans, or\r\nthat species of sumach which climbs along the trees, and is not by far\r\nso poisonous as the former. By this adventure he was so convinced of\r\nthe power of the poison tree, that I could not easily persuade him to\r\ngather more seeds of it for me. But he not only felt the noxious\r\neffects of it in summer when he was very hot, but even in winter when\r\nboth he and the wood were cold. Hence it appears that though a person\r\nbe secured against the power of this poison for some time, yet that in\r\nlength of time he may be affected with it as well, as people of a\r\nweaker constitution.\r\n\r\nI have likewise tried experiments of every kind with the poison tree on\r\nmyself. I have spread its juice upon my hands, cut and broke its\r\nbranches, peeled off its bark, and rubbed my hands with it, smelt at\r\nit, carried pieces of it in my bare hands, and repeated all this\r\nfrequently, without feeling the baneful effects so commonly annexed to\r\nit; but I however once experienced that the poison of the sumach was\r\nnot entirely without effect upon me. On a hot day in summer, as I was\r\nin some degree of perspiration, I cut a branch of the tree, and carried\r\nit in my hand for about half an hour together, and smelt at it now and\r\nthen. I felt no effects from it, till in the evening. But next morning\r\nI awoke with a violent itching of my eye-lids, and the parts\r\nthereabouts, and this was so painful, that I could hardly keep my hands\r\nfrom it. It ceased after I had washed my eyes for a while, with very\r\ncold water. But my eye-lids were very stiff all that day. At night the\r\nitching returned, and in the morning as I awoke, I felt it as ill as\r\nthe morning before, and I used the same remedy against it. However it\r\ncontinued almost for a whole week together, and my eyes were very red,\r\nand my eye-lids were with difficulty moved, during all that time. My\r\npain ceased entirely afterwards. About the same time, I had spread the\r\njuice of the tree very thick upon my hand. Three days after they\r\noccasioned blisters, which soon went off without affecting me much. I\r\nhave not experienced any thing more of the effects of this plant, nor\r\nhad I any desire so to do. However I found that it could not exert its\r\npower upon me, when I was not perspiring.\r\n\r\nI have never heard that the poison of this Sumach has been mortal; but\r\nthe pain ceases after a few days duration. The natives formerly made\r\ntheir flutes of this tree, because it has a great deal of pith. Some\r\npeople assured me, that a person suffering from its noisome\r\nexhalations, would easily recover by spreading a mixture of the wood,\r\nburnt to charcoal, and hog’s lard, upon the swelled parts. Some\r\nasserted that they had really tried this remedy. In some places this\r\ntree is rooted out on purpose, that its poison may not affect the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nI received to day, several curiosities belonging to the mineral\r\nkingdom, which were collected in the country. The following were those\r\nwhich were most worth attention. The first was a white, and quite\r\ntransparent crystal. [10] Many of this kind are found in Pensylvania,\r\nin several kinds of stone, especially in a pale-grey limestone. The\r\npieces are of the thickness and length of the little finger, and\r\ncommonly as transparent as possible. But I have likewise got crystals\r\nhere, of the length of a foot, and of the thickness of a middle-sized\r\nman’s leg. They were not so transparent as the former.\r\n\r\nThe cubic Pyrites of Bishop Browallius, [11] was of a very regular\r\ntexture. But its cubes were different in size, for in some of the\r\ncubes, the planes of the sides only amounted to a quarter of an inch,\r\nbut in the biggest cubes, they were full two inches. Some were\r\nexceedingly glittering, so that it was very easy to be perceived that\r\nthey consisted of sulphureous pyrites. But in some one or two sides\r\nonly, glittered so well, and the others were dark-brown. Yet most of\r\nthese marcasites had this same colour on all the sides. On breaking\r\nthem they shewed the pure pyrites. They are found near Lancaster in\r\nthis province, and sometimes lie quite above the ground; but commonly\r\nthey are found at the depth of eight feet or more from the surface of\r\nthe ground, on digging wells and the like. Mr. Hesselius had several\r\npieces of this kind of stone, which he made use of in his work. He\r\nfirst burnt them, then pounded or ground them to a powder, and at last\r\nrubbed them still finer in the usual way, and this afforded him a fine\r\nreddish-brown colour.\r\n\r\nFew black pebbles are found in this province, which on the other hand\r\nyields many kinds of marble, especially a white one, with pale-grey\r\nbluish spots, which is found in a quarry at the distance of a few\r\nEnglish miles from Philadelphia, and is very good for working, though\r\nit is not one of the finest kind of marbles. They make many tombstones\r\nand tables, enchase chimneys and doors, floors of marble flags in the\r\nrooms, and the like of this kind of marble. A quantity of this\r\ncommodity is shipped to different parts of America.\r\n\r\nMuscovy glass, [12] is found in many places hereabouts, and some pieces\r\nof it are pretty large, and as fine as those which are brought from\r\nRussia. I have seen some of them, which were a foot and more in length.\r\nAnd I have several in my collection that are nearly nine inches square.\r\nThe Swedes on their first arrival here made their windows of this\r\nnative glass.\r\n\r\nA pale grey fine limestone, [13] of a compact texture, lies in many\r\nplaces hereabouts, and affords a fine lime. Some pieces of it are so\r\nfull of fine transparent crystals, that almost half of the stone\r\nconsists of nothing else. But besides this limestone, they make lime\r\nnear the sea-shore, from oyster shells, and bring it to town in winter,\r\nwhich is said to be worse for masonry, but better for white-washing,\r\nthan that which is got from the limestone.\r\n\r\nCoals have not yet been found in Pensylvania; but people pretend to\r\nhave seen them higher up in the country among the natives. Many people\r\nhowever agree that they are met with in great quantity more to the\r\nnorth, near Cape Breton. [14]\r\n\r\nThe ladies make wine from some of the fruits of the land. They\r\nprincipally take white and red currants for that purpose, since the\r\nshrubs of this kind are very plentiful in the gardens, and succeed very\r\nwell. An old sailor who had frequently been in New-foundland, told me\r\nthat red currants grew wild in that country in great quantity. They\r\nlikewise make a wine of strawberries, which grow in great plenty in the\r\nwoods, but are sourer than the Swedish ones. The American blackberries,\r\nor Rubus occidentalis, are likewise made use of for this purpose, for\r\nthey grow every where about the fields, almost as abundantly as\r\nthistles in Sweden, and have a very agreeable taste. In Maryland a wine\r\nis made of the wild grapes, which grow in the woods of that province.\r\nRaspberries and cherries which are planted on purpose, and taken great\r\ncare of, likewise afford a very fine wine. It is unnecessary to give an\r\naccount of the manner of making the currant wine, for in Sweden this\r\nart is in higher perfection than in North America.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 21st. The common Privet, or Ligustrum vulgare, Linn.\r\ngrows among the bushes in thickets and woods. But I cannot determine\r\nwhether it belongs to the indigenous plants, or to those which the\r\nEnglish have introduced, the fruits of which the birds may have\r\ndispersed every where. The enclosures and pales are generally made here\r\nof wooden planks and posts. But a few, good œconomists, having already\r\nthought of sparing the woods for future times, have begun to plant\r\nquick hedges round their fields; and to this purpose they take the\r\nabove-mentioned privet, which they plant in a little bank, which is\r\nthrown up for it. The soil every where hereabouts is a clay mixed with\r\nsand, and of course very loose. The privet hedges however, are only\r\nadapted to the tameness of the cattle and other animals here; for the\r\nhogs all have a triangular yoke about their necks, and the other cattle\r\nare not very unruly. But in such places where the cattle break through\r\nthe enclosures, hedges of this kind would make but a poor defence. The\r\npeople who live in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, are obliged to\r\nkeep their hogs enclosed.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I rode with Mr. Peter Cock, who was a merchant, born\r\nat Karlscron in Sweden, to his country seat, about nine miles from the\r\ntown, to the north-west.\r\n\r\nThe country on both sides of the road was covered with a great forest.\r\nThe trees were all with annual leaves, and I did not see a single fir\r\nor pine. Most of the trees were different sorts of oak. But we likewise\r\nsaw chesnut trees, walnut trees, locust trees, apple trees, hiccory,\r\nblackberry bushes, and the like. The ground ceased to be so even as it\r\nwas before, and began to look more like the English ground, diversified\r\nwith hills and vallies. We found neither mountains nor great stones,\r\nand the wood was so much thinned, and the ground so uniformly even,\r\nthat we could see a great way between the trees, under which we rode\r\nwithout any inconvenience; for there were no bushes to stop us. In some\r\nplaces where the soil was thrown up, we saw some little stones of that\r\nkind of which the houses here are so generally built. I intend to\r\ndescribe them in the sequel.\r\n\r\nAs we went on in the wood, we continually saw at moderate distances\r\nlittle fields, which had been cleared of the wood. Each of these was a\r\nfarm. These farms were commonly very pretty, and a walk of trees\r\nfrequently led from them to the high-road. The houses were all built of\r\nbrick, or of the stone which is here every where to be met with. Every\r\ncountryman, even though he were the poorest peasant, had an orchard\r\nwith apples, peaches, chesnuts, walnuts, cherries, quinces, and such\r\nfruits, and sometimes we saw the vines climbing along them. The vallies\r\nwere frequently provided with little brooks which contained a crystal\r\nstream. The corn on the sides of the road, was almost all mown, and no\r\nother grain besides maize and buckwheat was standing. The former was to\r\nbe met with near each farm, in greater or lesser quantities; it grew\r\nvery well and to a great length, the stalks being from six to ten foot\r\nhigh and covered with fine green leaves. Buckwheat likewise was not\r\nvery uncommon, and in some places the people were beginning to reap it.\r\nI intend in the sequel to be more particular about the qualities and\r\nuse of these kinds of corn.\r\n\r\nAfter a ride of six English miles, we came to Germantown; this town has\r\nonly one street, but is near two English miles long. It is for the\r\ngreatest part inhabited by Germans, who from time to time come from\r\ntheir country to North America, and settle here, because they enjoy\r\nsuch privileges, as they are not possessed of any where else. Most of\r\nthe inhabitants are tradesmen, and make almost every thing in such\r\nquantity and perfection, that in a short time this province will want\r\nvery little from England, its mother country. Most of the houses were\r\nbuilt of the stone which is mixed with glimmer, and found every where\r\ntowards Philadelphia, but is more scarce further on. Several houses\r\nhowever were made of brick. They were commonly two stories high, and\r\nsometimes higher. The roofs consisted of shingles of the white cedar\r\nwood. Their shape resembled that of the roofs in Sweden, but the angles\r\nthey formed at the top were either obtuse, right angled, or acute,\r\naccording as the slopes were steep or easy. They sometimes formed\r\neither the half of an octogon, or the half of a dodecagon.\r\n\r\nMany of the roofs were made in such a manner, that they could be walked\r\nupon, having a balustrade round them. Many of the upper stories had\r\nbalconies before them, from whence the people had a prospect into the\r\nstreet. The windows, even those in the third story, had shutters. Each\r\nhouse had a fine garden. The town had three churches, one for the\r\nlutherans, another for the reformed protestants, and the third for the\r\nquakers. The inhabitants were so numerous, that the street was always\r\nfull. The baptists have likewise a meeting-house.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 22d. After I had been at church, I employed the remainder\r\nof the day in conversing with the most considerable people in town, who\r\nhad lived here for a long while, and I enquired into the curiosities\r\nhereabouts.\r\n\r\nMr. Cock had a fine spring near his country seat; it came from a sandy\r\nhill, and afforded water enough constantly to fill a little brook. Just\r\nabove this spring Mr. Cock had erected a building from those\r\nabove-mentioned glittering stones, into which were put many jugs, and\r\nother earthen vessels full of milk; for it kept very well in cold water\r\nduring the great heat with which the summer is attended here.\r\n\r\nI afterwards met with many houses which were situated like this on\r\nsprings, and therefore were destined to keep the meat and milk fresh.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the enclosures round the corn-fields and meadows hereabouts,\r\nwere made of planks fastened in a horizontal direction. I only\r\nperceived a hedge of privet in one single place. The enclosures were\r\nnot made like ours, for the people here take posts from four to six\r\nfeet in height, and make two or three holes into them, so that there\r\nwas a distance of two feet and above between them. Such a post does the\r\nsame service as two, and sometimes three poles are scarce sufficient.\r\nThe posts were fastened in the ground, at two or three fathoms distance\r\nfrom each other, and the holes in them kept up the planks, which were\r\nnine inches, and sometimes a foot broad, and lay above each other from\r\none post to the next. Such an enclosure therefore looked at a distance\r\nlike the hurdles in which we enclose the sheep at night in Sweden. They\r\nwere really no closer than hurdles, being only destined to keep out the\r\ngreater animals, such as cows and horses. The hogs are kept near the\r\nfarm-houses every where about Philadelphia, and therefore this\r\nenclosure does not need to be made closer on their account. Chesnut\r\ntrees were commonly made use of for this purpose, because this wood\r\nkeeps longest against putrefaction, and an enclosure made of it can\r\nstand for thirty years together. But where no chesnut wood was to be\r\ngot, the white, and likewise the black oaks were taken for that\r\npurpose. Of all kinds of wood, that of the red cedar holds out the\r\nlongest. The greatest quantity of it is brought up here; for near\r\nPhiladelphia it is not plentiful enough, to be made use of for\r\nenclosures; however there are many enclosures near the town made of\r\nthis wood.\r\n\r\nThe best wood for fuel in every body’s opinion is the hiccory, or a\r\nspecies of walnut; for it heats well; but is not good for enclosures,\r\nsince it cannot well withstand putrefaction when it is in the open air.\r\nThe white and black oaks are next in goodness for fuel. The woods with\r\nwhich Philadelphia is surrounded, would lead one to conclude, that fuel\r\nmust be cheap there. But it is far from being so, because the great and\r\nhigh forest near the town is the property of some people of quality and\r\nfortune, who do not regard the money which they could make of them.\r\nThey do not sell so much as they require for their own use, and much\r\nless would they sell it to others. But they leave the trees for times\r\nto come, expecting that wood will become much more scarce. However they\r\nsell it to joiners, coach-makers, and other artists, who pay\r\nexorbitantly for it. For a quantity of hiccory of eight foot in length,\r\nand four in depth, and the pieces being likewise four foot long, they\r\npaid at present eighteen shillings of Pensylvanian currency. But the\r\nsame quantity of oak only came to twelve shillings. The people who came\r\nat present to sell wood in the market were peasants, who lived at a\r\ngreat distance from the town. Every body complained that fuel in the\r\nspace of a few years, was risen in price to many times as much again as\r\nit had been, and to account for this, the following reasons were given:\r\nthe town is encreased to such a degree, as to be four or six times\r\nbigger, and more populous than what some old people have known it to\r\nbe, when they were young. Many brick-kilns have been made hereabouts,\r\nwhich require a great quantity of wood. The country is likewise more\r\ncultivated than it used to be, and consequently great woods have been\r\ncut down for that purpose; and the farms built in those places likewise\r\nconsume a quantity of wood. Lastly, they melt iron out of the ore, in\r\nseveral places about the town, and this work always goes on without\r\ninterruption. For these reasons it is concluded in future times\r\nPhiladelphia will be obliged to pay a great price for wood.\r\n\r\nThe wine of blackberries, which has a very fine taste, is made in the\r\nfollowing manner. The juice of the blackberries is pressed out, and put\r\ninto a vessel; with half a gallon of this juice, an equal quantity of\r\nwater is well mixed. Three pounds of brown sugar are added to this\r\nmixture, which must then stand for a while, and after that, it is fit\r\nfor use. Cherry wine is made in the same manner, but care must be taken\r\nthat when the juice is pressed out, the stones be not crushed, for they\r\ngive the wine a bad taste.\r\n\r\nThey make brandy from peaches here, after the following method. The\r\nfruit is cut asunder, and the stones are taken out. The pieces of fruit\r\nare then put into a vessel, where they are left for three weeks or a\r\nmonth, till they are quite putrid. They are then put into the\r\ndistilling vessel, and the brandy is made and afterwards distilled over\r\nagain. This brandy is not good for people who have a more refined\r\ntaste, but it is only for the common kind of people, such as workmen\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nApples yield a brandy, when prepared in the same manner as the peaches.\r\nBut for this purpose those apples are chiefly taken, which fall from\r\nthe tree before they are ripe.\r\n\r\nThe American Night-shade, or Phytolacca decandra, Linn. S. N. grows\r\nabundantly near the farms, on the highroad in hedges and bushes, and in\r\nseveral places in the fields. Whenever I came to any of these places I\r\nwas sure of finding this plant in great abundance. Most of them had red\r\nberries, which grew in bunches, and looked very tempting, though they\r\nwere not at all fit for eating. Some of these plants were yet in\r\nflower. In some places, such as in the hedges, and near the houses,\r\nthey sometimes grow two fathom high. But in the fields were always low;\r\nyet I could no where perceive that the cattle had eaten of it. A German\r\nof this place who was a confectioner told me, that the dyers gathered\r\nthe roots of this plant and made a fine red dye of them.\r\n\r\nHere are several species of Squirrels. The ground Squirrels, or Sciurus\r\nstriatus, Linn. S. N. are commonly kept in cages, because they are very\r\npretty: but they cannot he entirely tamed. The greater Squirrels, or\r\nSciurus cinereus, Linn. S. N. frequently do a great deal of mischief in\r\nthe plantations, but particularly destroy the maize. For they climb up\r\nthe stalks, cut the ears in pieces and eat only the loose and sweet\r\nkernel which lies quite in the inside. They sometimes come by hundreds\r\nupon a maize-field, and then destroy the whole crop of a countryman in\r\none night. In Maryland therefore every one is obliged annually to bring\r\nfour squirrels, and their heads are given to the surveyor, to prevent\r\ndeceit. In other provinces every body that kills squirrels, received\r\ntwopence a piece for them from the public, on delivering the heads.\r\nTheir flesh is eaten and reckoned a dainty. The skins are sold, but are\r\nnot much esteemed. Squirrels are the chief food of the rattle-snake and\r\nother snakes, and it was a common fancy with the people hereabouts,\r\nthat when the rattle snake lay on the ground, and fixed its eyes upon a\r\nsquirrel, the latter would be as it were fascinated, and that though it\r\nwere on the uppermost branches of a tree, yet it would come down by\r\ndegrees, till it leaped into the snake’s mouth. The snake then licks\r\nthe little animal several times, and makes it wet all over with its\r\nspittle, that it may go down the throat easier. It then swallows the\r\nwhole squirrel at once. When the snake has made such a good meal, it\r\nlies down to rest without any concern.\r\n\r\nThe quadruped, which Dr. Linnæus in the memoirs of the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences, has described by the name of Ursus cauda elongata, and which\r\nhe calls Ursus Lotor, in his Systema Naturæ, is here called Raccoon. It\r\nis found very frequently, and destroys many chickens. It is hunted by\r\ndogs, and when it runs upon a tree to save itself, a man climbs upon\r\nthe tree after it, and shakes it down to the ground, where the dogs\r\nkill it. The flesh is eaten, and is reputed to taste well. The bone of\r\nits male parts is made use of for a tobacco-stopper. The hatters\r\npurchase their skins, and make hats out of the hair, which are next in\r\ngoodness to beavers. The tail is worn round the neck in winter, and\r\ntherefore is likewise valuable. The Raccoon is frequently the food of\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\nSome Englishmen asserted that near the river Potomack in Virginia, a\r\ngreat quantity of oyster shells were to be met with, and that they\r\nthemselves had seen whole mountains of them. The place where they are\r\nfound is said to be about two English miles distant from the sea-shore.\r\nThe proprietor of that ground burns lime out of them. This stratum of\r\noyster-shells is two fathom and more deep. Such quantities of shells\r\nhave likewise been found in other places, especially in New York, on\r\ndigging in the ground; and in one place, at the distance of some\r\nEnglish miles from the sea, avast quantity of oyster-shells, and of\r\nother shells was found. Some people conjectured that the natives had\r\nformerly lived in that place, and had left the shells of the oysters\r\nwhich they had consumed, in such great heaps. But others could not\r\nconceive how it happened that they were thrown in such immense\r\nquantities all into one place.\r\n\r\nEvery one is of opinion that the American savages were a very\r\ngood-natured people, if they were not attacked. No body is so strict in\r\nkeeping his word as a savage. If any one of their allies come to visit\r\nthem, they shew him more kindness, and greater endeavours to serve him,\r\nthan he could have expected from his own countrymen. Mr. Cock gave me\r\nthe following relation, as a proof of their integrity. About two years\r\nago, an English merchant travelling amongst the savages, in order to\r\nsell them necessaries, and to buy other goods, was secretly killed,\r\nwithout the murderer’s being found out. But about a year after, the\r\nsavages found out the guilty person amongst themselves. They\r\nimmediately took him up, bound his hands on his back, and thus sent him\r\nwith a guard to the governor at Philadelphia, and sent him word, that\r\nthey could no longer acknowledge this wretch (who had been so wicked\r\ntowards an Englishman) as their countryman, and therefore would have\r\nnothing more to do with him, and that they delivered him up to the\r\ngovernor, to be punished for his villainy as the laws of England\r\ndirect. This Indian was afterwards hanged at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nTheir good natural parts are proved by the following account, which\r\nmany people have given me as a true one. When they send their\r\nambassadors to the English colonies, in order to settle things of\r\nconsequence with the governor, they sit down on the ground, as soon as\r\nthey come to his audience, and hear with great attention the governor’s\r\ndemands which they are to make an answer to. His demands are sometimes\r\nmany. Yet they have only a stick in their hand, and make their marks on\r\nit with a knife, without writing any thing else down. But when they\r\nreturn the next day to give in their resolutions, they answer all the\r\ngovernor’s articles in the same order, in which he delivered them,\r\nwithout leaving one out, or changing the order, and give such accurate\r\nanswers, as if they had an account of them at full length in writing.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleidorn related another story, which gave me great pleasure. He\r\nsaid he had been at New York, and had found a venerable old American\r\nsavage amongst several others in an inn. This old man began to talk\r\nwith Sleidorn as soon as the liquor was getting the better of his head,\r\nand boasted that he could write and read in English. Sleidorn therefore\r\ndesired leave to ask a question, which the old man readily granted.\r\nSleidorn then asked him, whether he knew who was first circumcised? and\r\nthe old man immediately answered, Father Abraham; but at the same time\r\nasked leave to propose a question in his turn, which Sleidorn granted;\r\nthe old man then said, who was the first quaker? Sleidorn said it was\r\nuncertain, that some took one person for it, and some another; but the\r\ncunning old fellow told him, you are mistaken, sir; Mordecai was the\r\nfirst quaker, for he would not take off his hat to Haman. Many of the\r\nsavages, who are yet heathens, are said to have some obscure notion of\r\nthe deluge. But I am convinced from my own experience, that they are\r\nnot at all acquainted with it.\r\n\r\nI met with people here who maintained that giants had formerly lived in\r\nthese parts, and the following particulars confirmed them in this\r\nopinion. A few years ago some people digging in the ground, met with a\r\ngrave which contained human bones of an astonishing size. The Tibia is\r\nsaid to have been fourteen feet long, and the os femoris to have\r\nmeasured as much. The teeth are likewise said to have been of a size\r\nproportioned to the rest, But more bones of this kind have not yet been\r\nfound. Persons skilled in anatomy, who have seen these bones, have\r\ndeclared that they were human bones. One of the teeth has been sent to\r\nHamburgh, to a person who collected natural curiosities. Among the\r\nsavages, in the neighbourhood of the place where the bones were found,\r\nthere is an account handed down through many generations from fathers\r\nto children, that in this neighbourhood, on the banks of a river, there\r\nlived a very tall and strong man, in ancient times, who carried the\r\npeople over the river on his back, and waded in the water, though it\r\nwas very deep. Every body to whom he did this service gave him some\r\nmaize, some skins of animals, or the like. In fine he got his\r\nlivelyhood by this means, and was as it were the ferryman of those who\r\nwanted to pass the river.\r\n\r\nThe soil here consists for the greatest part of sand, which is more or\r\nless mixed with clay. Both the sand and the clay, are of the colour of\r\npale bricks. To judge by appearance the ground was none of the best;\r\nand this conjecture was verified by the inhabitants of the country.\r\nWhen a corn-field has been obliged to bear the same kind of corn for\r\nthree years together, it does not after that produce any thing at all\r\nif it be not well manured, or fallowed for some years. Manure is very\r\ndifficult to be got, and therefore people rather leave the field\r\nuncultivated. In that interval it is covered with all sorts of plants\r\nand trees; and the countryman in the mean while, cultivates a piece of\r\nground which has till then been fallow, or he chuses a part of the\r\nground which has never been ploughed before, and he can in both cases\r\nbe pretty sure of a plentiful crop. This method can here be used with\r\ngreat convenience. For the soil is loose, so that it can easily be\r\nploughed, and every countryman has commonly a great deal of land for\r\nhis property. The cattle here are neither housed in winter, nor tended\r\nin the fields, and for this reason they cannot gather a sufficient\r\nquantity of dung.\r\n\r\nAll the cattle has been originally brought over from Europe. The\r\nnatives have never had any, and at present few of them care to get any.\r\nBut the cattle degenerates by degrees here, and becomes smaller. For\r\nthe cows, horses, sheep, and hogs, are all larger in England, though\r\nthose which are brought over are of that breed. But the first\r\ngeneration decreases a little, and the third and fourth is of the same\r\nsize with the cattle already common here. The climate, the soil, and\r\nthe food, altogether contribute their share towards producing this\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the inhabitants of the country, commonly sooner\r\nacquire understanding, but likewise grow sooner old than the people in\r\nEurope. It is nothing uncommon to see little children, giving sprightly\r\nand ready answers to questions that are proposed to them, so that they\r\nseem to have as much understanding as old men. But they do not attain\r\nto such an age as the Europeans, and it is almost an unheard of thing,\r\nthat a person born in this country, should live to be eighty or ninety\r\nyears of age. But I only speak of the Europeans that settled here. For\r\nthe savages, or first inhabitants, frequently attained a great age,\r\nthough at present such examples are uncommon, which is chiefly\r\nattributed to the great use of brandy, which the savages have learnt of\r\nthe Europeans. Those who are born in Europe attain a greater age here,\r\nthan those who are born here, of European parents. In the last war, it\r\nplainly appeared that these new Americans were by far less hardy than\r\nthe Europeans in expeditions, sieges, and long sea voyages, and died in\r\nnumbers. It is very difficult for them to use themselves to a climate\r\ndifferent from their own. The women cease bearing children sooner than\r\nin Europe. They seldom or never have children, after they are forty or\r\nforty-five years old, and some leave off in the thirtieth year of their\r\nage. I enquired into the causes of this, but no one could give me a\r\ngood one. Some said it was owing to the affluence in which the people\r\nlive here. Some ascribed it to the inconstancy and changeableness of\r\nthe weather, and believed that there hardly was a country on earth in\r\nwhich the weather changes so often in a day, as it does here. For if it\r\nwere ever so hot, one could not be certain whether in twenty-four hours\r\nthere would not be a piercing cold. Nay, sometimes the weather will\r\nchange five or six times a day.\r\n\r\nThe trees in this country have the same qualities as its inhabitants.\r\nFor the ships which are built of American wood, are by no means equal\r\nin point of strength, to those which are built in Europe. This is what\r\nnobody attempts to contradict. When a ship which is built here, has\r\nserved eight or twelve years it is worth little; and if one is to be\r\nmet with, which has been in use longer and is yet serviceable, it is\r\nreckoned very astonishing. It is difficult to find out the causes from\r\nwhence this happens. Some lay the fault to the badness of the wood:\r\nothers condemn the method of building the ships, which is to make them\r\nof trees which are yet green, and have had no time to dry. I believe\r\nboth causes are joined. For I found oak, which at the utmost had been\r\ncut down about twelve years, and was covered by a hard bark. But upon\r\ntaking off this bark, the wood below it was almost entirely rotten, and\r\nlike flour, so that I could rub it into powder between my fingers. How\r\nmuch longer will not our European oak stand before it moulders?\r\n\r\nAt night we returned to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 23d. There are no Hares in this country, but some\r\nanimals, which are a medium between our Hares and Rabbets, and make a\r\ngreat devastation whenever they get into fields of cabbage and turneps.\r\n\r\nMany people have not been able to find out why the North American\r\nplants which are carried to Europe and planted there, for the greatest\r\npart flower so late, and do not get ripe fruit before the frost\r\novertakes them, although it appears from several accounts of travels,\r\nthat the winters in Pensylvania, and more so those in New York, New\r\nEngland, and Canada, are full as severe as our Swedish winters, and\r\ntherefore are much severer than those which are felt in England.\r\nSeveral men of judgment charged me for this reason to examine and\r\nenquire into this phœnomenon with all possible care. But I shall\r\ninstead of an answer, rather give a few remarks which I made upon the\r\nclimate and upon the plants of North America, and leave my readers at\r\nliberty to draw the conclusions themselves.\r\n\r\n1. It is true, that the winters in Pensylvania, and much more those in\r\nthe more northern provinces, are frequently as severe as our Swedish\r\nwinters, and much colder than the English ones, or those of the\r\nsouthern parts of Europe. For I found at Philadelphia, which is above\r\ntwenty deg. more southerly than several provinces in Sweden, that the\r\nthermometer of professor Celsius, fell twenty-four deg. below the\r\nfreezing point in winter. Yet I was assured that the winters I spent\r\nhere, were none of the coldest, but only common ones, which I could\r\nlikewise conclude from the Delaware’s not being frozen strong enough to\r\nbear a carriage at Philadelphia during my stay, though this often\r\nhappens. On considering the breadth of the river which I have already\r\nmentioned in my description of Philadelphia, and the difference between\r\nhigh and low water, which is eight English feet; it will pretty plainly\r\nappear that a very intense frost is required to cover the Delaware with\r\nsuch thick ice.\r\n\r\n2. But it is likewise true, that though the winters are severe here,\r\nyet they are commonly of no long duration, and I can justly say, that\r\nthey do not continue above two months and sometimes even less, at\r\nPhiladelphia; and it is something very uncommon when they continue for\r\nthree months together, in so much that it is put into the gazettes.\r\nNearer the pole the winters are somewhat longer, and in the quite\r\nnorthern parts they are as long as the Swedish winters. The daily\r\nmeteorological observations which I have made during my stay in\r\nAmerica, and which I intend to annex at the end of each volume of this\r\nwork, will give more light in this matter.\r\n\r\n3. The heat in summer is excessive, and without intermission. I own I\r\nhave seen the thermometer rise to nearly the same degree at Aobo in\r\nFinland. But the difference is, that when the thermometer of professor\r\nCelsius rose to thirty deg. above the freezing point once in two or\r\nthree summers at Aobo, the same thermometer did not only for three\r\nmonths together stand at the same degree, but even sometimes rose\r\nhigher; not only in Pensylvania, but likewise in New York, Albany, and\r\na great part of Canada. During the summers which I spent at\r\nPhiladelphia, the thermometer has two or three times risen to\r\nthirty-six deg. above the freezing point. It may therefore with great\r\ncertainty be said, that in Pensylvania the greatest part of April, the\r\nwhole May, and all the following months till October, are like our\r\nSwedish months of June and July. So excessive and continued a heat must\r\ncertainly have very great effects. I here again refer to my\r\nmeteorological observations. It must likewise be ascribed to the\r\neffects of this heat that the common melons, the water melons, and the\r\npumpions of different sorts are sown in the fields without any bells or\r\nthe like put over them, and yet are ripe as early as July; further,\r\nthat cherries are ripe at Philadelphia about the 25th. of May, and that\r\nin Pensylvania the wheat is frequently reaped in the middle of June.\r\n\r\n4. The whole of September, and half, if not the whole of October, are\r\nthe finest months in Pensylvania, for the preceding ones are too hot.\r\nBut these represent our July and half of August. The greatest part of\r\nthe plants are in flower in September, and many do not begin to open\r\ntheir flowers before the latter end of this month. I make no doubt that\r\nthe goodness of the season, which is enlivened by a clear sky, and a\r\ntolerably hot sun-shine, greatly contributes towards this last effort\r\nof Flora. Yet though these plants come out so late, they are quite ripe\r\nbefore the middle of October. But I am not able to account for their\r\ncoming up so late in autumn, and I rather ask, why do not the Centaurea\r\nJacea, the Gentiana, Amarella and Centaurium of Linnæus, and the common\r\ngolden rod, or Solidago Virgaurea flower before the end of summer? or\r\nwhy do the common noble liverwort, or Anemone Hepatica, the wild\r\nviolets (Viola martia, Linn.) the mezereon (Daphne Mezereum, Linn.) and\r\nother plants shew their flowers so early in spring? It has pleased the\r\nAlmighty Creator to give to them this disposition. The weather at\r\nPhiladelphia during these months, is shewn by my meteorological tables.\r\nI have taken the greatest care in my observations, and have always\r\navoided putting the thermometer into any place where the sun could\r\nshine upon it, or where he had before heated the wall by his beams; for\r\nin those cases my observations would certainly not have been exact. The\r\nweather during our September and October is too well known to want an\r\nexplanation. [15]\r\n\r\n5. However there are some spontaneous plants in Pensylvania, which do\r\nnot every year bring their seeds to maturity before the cold begins. To\r\nthese belong some species of Gentiana, of Asters, and others. But in\r\nthese too the wisdom of the Creator has wisely ordered every thing in\r\nits turn. For almost all the plants which have the quality of flowering\r\nso late in autumn, are perennial, or such as, though they have no seed\r\nto propagate themselves, can revive by shooting new branches and stalks\r\nfrom the same root every year. But perhaps a natural cause may be given\r\nto account for the late growth of these plants. Before the Europeans\r\ncame into this country, it was inhabited by savage nations, who\r\npractised agriculture but little or not at all, and chiefly lived upon\r\nhunting and fishing. The woods therefore have never been meddled with,\r\nexcept that sometimes a small part was destroyed by fire. The accounts\r\nwhich we have of the first landing of the Europeans here, shew that\r\nthey found the country all over covered with thick forests. [16] From\r\nhence it follows, that excepting the higher trees, and the plants which\r\ngrow in the water or near the shore, the rest must for the greatest\r\npart have been obliged to grow perhaps for a thousand years together,\r\nin a shade, either below or between the trees, and they therefore\r\nnaturally belong to those which are only peculiar to woody and shady\r\nplaces. The trees in this country drop their leaves in such quantities\r\nin autumn, that the ground is covered with them to the depth of four or\r\nfive inches. These leaves lie a good while in the next summer before\r\nthey moulder, and this must of course hinder the growth of the plants\r\nwhich are under the trees, at the same time depriving them of the few\r\nrays of the sun which can come down to them through the thick leaves at\r\nthe top of the trees. These causes joined together make such plants\r\nflower much later than they would otherwise do. May it not therefore be\r\nsaid, that in so many centuries these plants had at last contracted a\r\nhabit of coming up very late, and that it would now require a great\r\nspace of time to make them lose this habit, and use them to quicken\r\ntheir growth?\r\n\r\nSeptember the 24th. We employed this whole day in gathering the seeds\r\nof plants of all kinds, and in putting scarce plants into the herbal.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 25th. Mr. Hesselius made me a present of a little piece\r\nof petrified wood, which was found in the ground here. It was four\r\ninches long, one inch broad, and three lines thick. It might plainly be\r\nseen that it had formerly been wood. For in the places where it had\r\nbeen polished, all the longitudinal fibres were easily distinguishable,\r\nso that it might have been taken for a piece of oak which was cut\r\nsmooth. My piece was part of a still greater piece. It was here thought\r\nto be petrified hiccory. I afterwards got more of it from other people.\r\nMr. Lewis Evans told me that on the boundaries of Virginia, a great\r\npetrified block of hiccory had been found in the ground, with the bark\r\non it, which was likewise petrified.\r\n\r\nMr. John Bartram is an Englishman, who lives in the country about four\r\nmiles from Philadelphia. He has acquired a great knowledge of natural\r\nphilosophy and history, and seems to be born with a peculiar genius for\r\nthese sciences. In his youth he had no opportunity of going to school.\r\nBut by his own diligence and indefatigable application he got, without\r\ninstruction, so far in Latin, as to understand all Latin books, and\r\neven those which were filled with botanical terms. He has in several\r\nsuccessive years made frequent excursions into different distant parts\r\nof North America, with an intention of gathering all sorts of plants\r\nwhich are scarce and little known. Those which he found he has planted\r\nin his own botanical garden, and likewise sent over their seeds or\r\nfresh roots to England. We owe to him the knowledge of many scarce\r\nplants, which he first found, and which were never known before. He has\r\nshewn great judgment, and an attention which lets nothing escape\r\nunnoticed. Yet with all these great qualities, he is to be blamed for\r\nhis negligence; for he did not care to write down his numerous and\r\nuseful observations. His friends at London once obliged him to send\r\nthem a short account of one of his travels, and they were very ready,\r\nwith a good intention, though not with sufficient judgment, to get this\r\naccount printed. But this book, did Mr. Bartram more harm than good;\r\nfor as he is rather backward in writing down what he knows, this\r\npublication was found to contain but few new observations. It would not\r\nhowever be doing justice to Mr. Bartram’s merit, if it were to be\r\njudged of by this performance. He has not filled it with a thousandth\r\npart of the great knowledge, which he has acquired in natural\r\nphilosophy and history, especially in regard to North America. I have\r\noften been at a loss to think of the sources, from whence he got many\r\nthings which came to his knowledge. I likewise owe him many things, for\r\nhe possessed that great quality of communicating every thing he knew. I\r\nshall therefore in the sequel, frequently mention this gentleman. For I\r\nshould never forgive myself, if I were to omit the name of the first\r\ninventor, and claim that as my own invention, which I learnt from\r\nanother person.\r\n\r\nMany Muscle shells, or Mytili anatini, are to be met with on the\r\nnorth-west side of the town in the clay-pits, which were at present\r\nfilled with water from a little brook in the neighbourhood. These\r\nmuscles seem to have been washed into that place by the tide, when the\r\nwater in the brook was high. For these clay-pits are not old, but were\r\nlately made. Poor boys sometimes go out of town, wade in the water, and\r\ngather great quantities of these shells, which they sell very easily,\r\nthey being reckoned a dainty.\r\n\r\nThe Virginian Azarole with a red fruit, or Linnæus’s Cratægus Crus\r\ngalli, is a species of hawthorn, and they plant it in hedges, for want\r\nof that hawthorn, which is commonly used for this purpose in Europe.\r\nIts berries are red, and of the same size, shape, and taste with those\r\nof our hawthorn. Yet this tree does not seem to make a good hedge, for\r\nits leaves were already fallen, whilst other trees still preserved\r\ntheirs. Its spines are very long and sharp; their length being two or\r\nthree inches. These spines are applied to some inconsiderable use. Each\r\nberry contains two stones.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram assured me, that the North American oak, cannot resist\r\nputrefaction for near such a space of time, as the European. For this\r\nreason, the boats (which carry all sorts of goods down from the upper\r\nparts of the country) upon the river Hudson, which is one of the\r\ngreatest in these parts, are made of two kinds of wood. That part which\r\nmust always be under water, is made of black oak; but the upper part,\r\nwhich is now above and now under water, and is therefore more exposed\r\nto putrefaction, is made of red cedar or Juniperus Virginiana, which is\r\nreckoned the most hardy wood in the country. The bottom is made of\r\nblack oak, because that wood is very tough. For the river being full of\r\nstones, and the boats frequently running against them, the black oak\r\ngives way, and therefore does not easily crack. But the cedar would not\r\ndo for this purpose; because it is hard and brittle. The oak likewise\r\nis not so much attacked by putrefaction, when it is always kept under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, I could always get good pears here; but every body\r\nacknowledged, that this fruit would not succeed well in the country.\r\n\r\nAll my observations and remarks on the qualities of the Rattle-snake,\r\nare inserted in the Memoirs of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, for the\r\nyear 1752, p. 316, and for the year 1753, p. 54, and thither I refer\r\nthe reader. [17]\r\n\r\nBears are very numerous higher up in the country, and do much mischief.\r\nMr. Bartram told me, that when a bear catches a cow, kills her in the\r\nfollowing manner: he bites a hole into the hide, and blows with all his\r\npower into it, till the animal swells excessively and dies; for the air\r\nexpands greatly between the flesh and the hide. [18] An old Swede\r\ncalled Nils Gustave’s son, who was ninety-one years of age, said, that\r\nin his youth, the bears had been very frequent hereabouts, but that\r\nthey had seldom attacked the cattle: that whenever a bear was killed,\r\nits flesh was prepared like pork, and that it had a very good taste.\r\nAnd the flesh of bears is still prepared like ham, on the river Morris.\r\nThe environs of Philadelphia, and even the whole province of\r\nPensylvania in general contain very few bears, they having been\r\nextirpated by degrees. In Virginia they kill them in several different\r\nways. Their flesh is eaten by both rich and poor, since it is reckoned\r\nequal in goodness to pork. In some parts of this province, where no\r\nhogs can be kept on account of the great numbers of bears, the people\r\nare used to catch and kill them, and to use them instead of hogs. The\r\nAmerican bears however, are said to be less fierce and dangerous, than\r\nthe European ones.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 26th. The broad plantain, or Plantago major, grows on the\r\nhighroads, foot paths, meadows, and in gardens in great plenty. Mr.\r\nBartram had found this plant in many places on his travels, but he did\r\nnot know whether it was an original American plant, or whether the\r\nEuropeans had brought it over. This doubt had its rise from the savages\r\n(who always had an extensive knowledge of the plants of the country)\r\npretending that this plant never grew here before the arrival of the\r\nEuropeans., They therefore give it a name which signifies, the\r\nEnglishman’s foot, for they say that where a European had walked, there\r\nthis plant grew in his foot steps.\r\n\r\nThe Chenopodium album, or Goosefoot with sinuated leaves, grows in\r\nplenty in the gardens. But it is more scarce near the houses, in the\r\nstreets, on dunghills and corn-fields. This seems to shew, that it is\r\nnot a native of America, but has been brought over amongst other seeds\r\nfrom Europe. In the same manner it is thought that the Tansey\r\n(Tanacetum vulgare, Linn.) which grows here and there in the hedges, on\r\nthe roads, and near houses, was produced from European seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common vervain, with blue flowers, or verbena officinalis, was\r\nshewn to me by Mr. Bartram, not far from his house in a little plain\r\nnear Philadelphia. It was the only place where he had found it in\r\nAmerica. And for this reason I suppose it was likewise sown here\r\namongst other European seeds.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram was at this time-building a house in Philadelphia, and had\r\nsunk a cellar to a considerable depth, the soil of which was thrown\r\nout. I here observed the following strata. The upper loose soil was\r\nonly half a foot deep, and of a dark brown colour. Under it was a\r\nstratum of clay so much blended with sand, that it was in greater\r\nquantity than the clay itself; and this stratum was eight feet deep.\r\nThese were both brick coloured. The next stratum consisted of little\r\npebbles mixed with a coarse sand. The stones consisted either of a\r\nclear, or of a dark Quartz; [19] they were quite smooth and roundish on\r\nthe outside, and lay in a stratum which was a foot deep. Then the\r\nbrick-coloured clay mixed with sand appeared again. But the depth of\r\nthis stratum could not be determined. Query, could the river formerly\r\nhave reached to this place and formed these strata?\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram has not only frequently found oyster-shells in the ground,\r\nbut likewise met with such shells and snails, as undoubtedly belong to\r\nthe sea, at the distance of a hundred and more English miles from the\r\nshore. He has even found them on the ridge of mountains which separate\r\nthe English plantations from the habitations of the savages. These\r\nmountains which the English call the blue mountains, are of\r\nconsiderable height, and extend, in one continued chain from north to\r\nsouth, or from Canada to Carolina. Yet in some places they have gaps,\r\nwhich are as it were broke through, to afford a passage for the great\r\nrivers, which roll down into the lower country.\r\n\r\nThe Cassia Chamæcrista grew on the roads the woods, and sometimes on\r\nuncultivated fields, especially when shrubs grew in them. Its leaves\r\nare like those of the Sensitive plant, or Mimosa, and have likewise the\r\nquality of contracting when touched, in common with the leaves of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe Crows in this country are little different from our common crows in\r\nSweden. Their size is the same with that of our crows, and they are as\r\nblack as jet in every part of their body. I saw them flying to day in\r\ngreat numbers together. Their voice is not quite like that of our\r\ncrows, but has rather more of the cry of the rook, or Linnæus’s Corvus\r\nfrugilegus.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram related, that on his journeys to the northern English\r\ncolonies, he had discovered great holes in the mountains on the banks\r\nof rivers, which according to his description, must exactly have been\r\nsuch giants pots, [20] as are to be met with in Sweden, and which I\r\nhave described in a particular dissertation read in the Royal Swedish\r\nAcademy of Sciences. Mr. Bartram has likewise addressed some letters to\r\nthe Royal Society at London upon this subject. For some people\r\npretended, that these holes were made by the savages, that they might\r\nin time of war hide their corn and other valuable effects in them. But\r\nhe wrote against this opinion, and accounted for the origin of these\r\ncavities in the following manner. When the ice settles, many pebbles\r\nstick in it. In spring when the snow melts, the water in the rivers\r\nswells so high that it reaches above the place where these holes are\r\nnow found in the mountains. The ice therefore will of course float as\r\nhigh. And then it often happens, that the pebbles which were contained\r\nin it, ever since autumn when it first settled on the banks of the\r\nriver, fall out of the ice upon the rocky bank, and are from thence\r\ncarried into a cleft or crack by the water. These pebbles are then\r\ncontinually turned about by the water, which comes in upon them, and by\r\nthis means they gradually form the hole. The water at the same time\r\npolishes the stone by its circular motion round it, and helps to make\r\nthe hole or cavity round. It is certain that by this turning and\r\ntossing, the stone is at last unfit for this purpose; but the river\r\nthrows commonly every spring other stones instead of it into the\r\ncavity, and they are turned round in the same manner. By this whirling\r\nboth the mountain and the stone afford either a fine or a coarse sand,\r\nwhich is washed away by the water when in spring, or at other times it\r\nis high enough to throw its waves into the cavity. This was the opinion\r\nof Mr. Bartram about the origin of these cavities. The Royal Society of\r\nSciences at London, has given a favourable reception to, and approved\r\nof them. [21] The remarks which I made in the summer of the year 1743,\r\nduring my stay at Land’s-Ort, in my country, will prove that I was at\r\nthat time of the same opinion, in regard to these holes. I have since\r\nfurther explained this opinion in a letter to the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences; and this letter is still preserved in the Academy’s Memoirs,\r\nwhich have not yet been published. But there is great reason to doubt,\r\nwhether all cavities of this kind in mountains, have the same origin.\r\n\r\nHere are different species of Mulberry trees, which grow wild in the\r\nforests of north and south America. In these parts the red mulberry\r\ntrees are more plentiful than any other. However Mr. Bartram assured me\r\nthat he had likewise seen the white mulberry trees growing wild, but\r\nthat they were more scarce. I asked him and several other people of\r\nthis country, why they did not set up silk manufactures, having such a\r\nquantity of mulberries, which succeed so easily? For it has been\r\nobserved that when the berries fall upon the ground where it is not\r\ncompact but loose, they soon put out several fine delicate shoots. But\r\nthey replied that it would not be worth while to erect any silk\r\nmanufactures here, because labour is so dear. For a man gets from\r\neighteen pence to three shillings and upwards, for one day’s work, and\r\nthe women are paid in proportion. They were therefore of opinion that\r\nthe cultivation of all sorts of corn, of hemp, and of flax, would be of\r\ngreater advantage, and that at the same time it did not require near so\r\nmuch care as the feeding of silk worms. By the trials of a governor in\r\nConnecticut, which is a more northern province than New York, it is\r\nevident however, that silk worms succeed very well here, and that this\r\nkind of mulberry trees is very good for them. The governor brought up a\r\ngreat quantity of silk worms in his court yard; and they succeeded so\r\nwell, and spun so much silk, as to afford him a sufficient quantity for\r\ncloathing himself and all his family.\r\n\r\nSeveral sorts of Vines likewise grow wild hereabouts. Whenever I made a\r\nlittle excursion out of town, I saw them in numerous places climbing up\r\ntrees and hedges. They clasp around them, and cover them sometimes\r\nentirely, and even hang down on the sides. This has the same appearance\r\nat a distance, as the tendrils of hops climbing along trees. I enquired\r\nof Mr. Bartram why they did not plant vineyards, or press wine from the\r\ngrapes of the wild vine. But they answered, that the same objection lay\r\nagainst it, which lies against the erection of a silk manufacture, that\r\nthe necessary hands were too scarce, and it therefore was more rational\r\nto make agriculture their chief employment. But the true reason\r\nundoubtedly is, that the wine which is pressed out of most of the North\r\nAmerican wild grapes is sour and sharp, and has not near such an\r\nagreeable taste, as that which is made from European grapes.\r\n\r\nThe Virginian Wake robin, or Arum Virginicum, grows in wet places. Mr.\r\nBartram told me, that the savages boiled the spadix and the berries of\r\nthis flower, and devoured it as a great dainty. When the berries are\r\nraw, they have a harsh, pungent taste, which they lose in great measure\r\nupon boiling.\r\n\r\nThe Sarothra Gentianoides, grows abundantly in the fields and under the\r\nbushes, in a dry sandy ground near Philadelphia. It looks extremely\r\nlike our whortleberry bushes when they first begin to green, and when\r\nthe points of the leaves are yet red. Mr. Bartram has sent this plant\r\nto Dr. Dillenius, but that gentleman did not know where he should range\r\nit. It is reckoned a very good traumatic, and this quality Mr. Bartram\r\nhimself experienced; for being thrown and kicked by a vicious horse, in\r\nsuch a manner as to have both his thighs greatly hurt, he boiled the\r\nSarothra and applied it to his wounds. It not only immediately appeased\r\nhis pain, which before had been very violent, but he likewise by its\r\nassistance recovered in a short time.\r\n\r\nHaving read in Mr. Miller’s Botanical Dictionary, that Mr. Peter\r\nCollinson had a particular Larch tree from America in his garden, I\r\nasked Mr. Bartram whether he was acquainted with it, he answered, that\r\nhe had sent it himself to Mr. Collinson, that it only grew in the\r\neastern parts of New Jersey, and that he had met with it in no other\r\nEnglish plantation. It differs from the other species of Larch trees,\r\nits cones being much less. I afterwards saw this tree in great plenty\r\nin Canada.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram was of opinion, that the apple tree was brought into\r\nAmerica by the Europeans, and that it never was there before their\r\narrival. But he looked upon peaches as an original American fruit, and\r\nas growing wild in the greatest part of America. Others again were of\r\nopinion, that they were first brought over by the Europeans. But all\r\nthe French in Canada agreed, that on the banks of the river Missisippi\r\nand in the country thereabouts peaches were found growing wild in great\r\nquantity. [22]\r\n\r\nSeptember the 27th. The tree which the English here call Persimon, is\r\nthe Diospyros Virginiana of Linnæus. It grows for the greatest part in\r\nwet places, round the water pits. I have already mentioned that the\r\nfruits of this tree are extremely bitter and sharp before they are\r\nquite ripe, and that being eaten in that state they quite contract ones\r\nmouth, and have a very disagreeable taste. But as soon as they are\r\nripe, which does not happen till they have been quite softened by the\r\nfrost, they are a very agreeable fruit. They are here eaten raw, and\r\nseldom any other way. But in a great book, which contains a description\r\nof Virginia, you meet with different ways of preparing the Persimon,\r\nunder the article of that name. Mr. Bartram, related that they were\r\ncommonly put upon the table amongst the sweet-meats, and that some\r\npeople made a tolerably good wine of them. Some of these Persimon\r\nfruits were dropped on the ground in his garden, and were almost quite\r\nripe, having been exposed to a great degree of the heat of the sun. We\r\npicked up a few and tasted them, and I must own that those who praised\r\nthis fruit as an agreeable one, have but done it justice. It really\r\ndeserves a place among the most palatable fruit of this country, when\r\nthe frost has thoroughly conquered its acrimony.\r\n\r\nThe Verbascum Thapsus, or great white Mullein, grows in great quantity\r\non roads, in hedges, on dry fields, and high meadows of a ground mixed\r\nwith sand. The Swedes here call it the tobacco of the savages, but\r\nowned, that they did not know whether or no the Indians really used\r\nthis plant instead of tobacco. The Swedes are used to tie the leaves\r\nround their feet and arms, when they have the ague. Some of them\r\nprepared a tea from the leaves, for the dysentery. A Swede likewise\r\ntold me, that a decoction of the roots was injected into the wounds of\r\nthe cattle which are full of worms, which killed these worms, and made\r\nthem fall out. [23]\r\n\r\nSeptember the 28th. The meadows which are surrounded by wood, and were\r\nat present mown, have a fine lively verdure. On the contrary when they\r\nlie on hills, or in open fields, or in some elevated situation,\r\nespecially so that the sun may be able to act upon them without any\r\nobstacles, their grass looks brown and dry. Several people from\r\nVirginia told me, that on account of the great heat and drought, the\r\nmeadows and pastures almost always had a brown colour, and looked as if\r\nthey were burnt. The inhabitants of those parts do not therefore enjoy\r\nthe pleasure which a European feels at the sight of our verdant,\r\nodoriferous meadows.\r\n\r\nThe American Nightshade, or the Phytolacca decandra, grows abundantly\r\nin the fields, and under the trees, on little hills. Its black berries\r\nare now ripe. We observed to day some little birds with a blue plumage,\r\nand of the size of our Hortulans and Yellow Hammers (Emberiza\r\nCitrinella and Emberiza Hortulanus) flying down from the trees, in\r\norder to settle upon the nightshade and eat its berries.\r\n\r\nTowards night I went to Mr. Bartram’s country seat.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 29th. The Gnaphalium margaritaceum, grows in astonishing\r\nquantities upon all uncultivated fields, glades, hills, and the like.\r\nIts height is different according to its different soil and situation.\r\nSometimes it is very ramose, and sometimes very little. It has a\r\nstrong, but agreeable smell. The English call it Life everlasting; for\r\nits flowers, which consist chiefly of dry, shining, silvery leaves\r\n(Folia calycina) do not change when dried. This plant is now every\r\nwhere in full blossom. But some have already lost the flowers, and are\r\nbeginning to drop the seeds. The English ladies were used to gather\r\ngreat quantities of this Life everlasting, and to pluck them with the\r\nstalks. For they put them into pots with or without water, amongst\r\nother fine flowers which they had gathered both in the gardens and in\r\nthe fields, and placed them as an ornament in the rooms. The English\r\nladies in general are much inclined to have fine flowers all the summer\r\nlong, in or upon the chimneys, sometimes upon a table, or before the\r\nwindows, either on account of their fine appearance, or for the sake of\r\ntheir sweet scent. The Gnaphalium above-mentioned, was one of those,\r\nwhich they kept in their rooms during the winter, because its flowers\r\nnever altered from what they were when they stood in the ground. Mr.\r\nBartram told me another use of this plant. A decoction of the flowers\r\nand stalks is used to bathe any pained or bruised part, or it is rubbed\r\nwith the plant itself tied up in a bag.\r\n\r\nInstead of flax several people made use of a kind of Dog’s bane, or\r\nLinnæus’s Apocynum cannabinum. The people prepared the stalks of this\r\nplant, in the same manner as we prepare those of hemp or flax. It was\r\nspun and several kinds of stuffs were woven from it. The savages are\r\nsaid to have had the art of making bags, fishing-nets, and the like,\r\nfor many centuries together, before the arrival of the Europeans.\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Bartram, whether he had observed in his travels, that the\r\nwater was fallen, and that the sea had formerly covered any places\r\nwhich were now land. He told me, that from what he had experienced, he\r\nwas convinced that the greatest part of this country, even for several\r\nmiles together, had formerly been under water. The reasons which led\r\nhim to give credit to this opinion, were the following.\r\n\r\n1. On digging in the blue mountains, which are above three hundred\r\nEnglish miles distant from the sea, you find loose oyster and other\r\nsorts of shells, and they are also likewise to be met with in the\r\nvallies formed by these mountains.\r\n\r\n2. A vast quantity of petrified shells are found in limestone, flint,\r\nand sandstone, on the same mountains. Mr. Bartram assured me at the\r\nsame time, that it was incredible what quantities of them there were in\r\nthe different kinds of stones of which the mountains consist.\r\n\r\n3. The same shells are likewise dug in great quantity, quite entire and\r\nnot mouldered, in the provinces of Virginia and Maryland, as also in\r\nPhiladelphia and in New York.\r\n\r\n4. On digging wells (not only in Philadelphia, but likewise in other\r\nplaces) the people have met with trees, roots, and leaves of oak, for\r\nthe greatest part, not yet rotten, at the depth of eighteen feet.\r\n\r\n5. The best soil and the richest mould is to be met with in the vallies\r\nhereabouts. These vallies are commonly crossed by a rivulet or brook.\r\nAnd on their declivity, a mountain commonly rises, which in those\r\nplaces where the brook passes close to it, looks as if it were cut on\r\npurpose. Mr. Bartram believed, that all these vallies formerly were\r\nlakes; that the water had by degrees hollowed out the mountain, and\r\nopened a passage for itself through it; and that the great quantity of\r\nslime which is contained in the water, and which had subsided to the\r\nbottom of the lake, was the rich soil which is at present in the\r\nvallies, and the cause of their great fertility. But such vallies and\r\ncloven mountains are very frequent in the country, and of this kind is\r\nthe peculiar gap between two mountains, through which a river takes its\r\ncourse or boundaries of New York and Pennsylvania. The people in a jest\r\nsay, that this opening by the D—l, as he wanted to go out of\r\nPennsylvania into New York.\r\n\r\n6. The whole appearance of the blue mountains, plainly shews that the\r\nwater formerly covered at part of them. For many are broken in a\r\npeculiar manner, but the highest are plain.\r\n\r\n7. When the savages are told, that shells are found on these high\r\nmountains, and that from thence there is reason to believe that the sea\r\nmust formerly have extended to them, and even in part flown over them;\r\nthey answer that this is not new to them, they having a tradition from\r\ntheir ancestors among them, that the sea formerly surrounded these\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n8. The water in rivers and brooks likewise decreases. Mills, which\r\nsixty years ago were built on rivers, and at that time had a sufficient\r\nsupply of water almost all the year long, have at present so little,\r\nthat they cannot be used, but after a heavy rain, or when the snow\r\nmelts in spring. This decrease of water in part arises from the great\r\nquantity of land which is now cultivated, and from the extirpation of\r\ngreat forests for that purpose.\r\n\r\n9. The sea-shore increases likewise in time. This arises from the\r\nquantity of sand continually thrown on shore from the bottom of the\r\nsea, by the waves.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram thought that some peculiar attention should be paid to\r\nanother thing relating to these observations. The shells which are to\r\nbe found petrified on the northern mountains, are of such kinds as at\r\npresent are not to be got in the sea, in the same latitude, and they\r\nare not fished on the shore, till you come to South Carolina. Mr.\r\nBartram from hence took an occasion to defend Dr. Thomas Burnet’s\r\nopinion, that the earth before the deluge was in a different position\r\ntowards the sun. He likewise asked whether the great bones which are\r\nsometimes found in the ground in Siberia, and which are supposed to be\r\nelephant’s bones and tusks, did not confirm this opinion. For at\r\npresent those animals cannot live in such cold countries; but if\r\naccording to Dr. Burnet, the sun once formed different zones about our\r\nearth, from those it now makes, the elephant may easily be supposed to\r\nhave lived in Siberia. [24] However it seems that all which we have\r\nhitherto mentioned, may have been the effect of different causes. To\r\nthose belong the universal deluge, the increase of land which is merely\r\nthe work of time, and the changes of the course of rivers, which when\r\nthe snow melts and in great floods, leave their first beds, and form\r\nnew ones.\r\n\r\nAt some distance from Mr. Bartram’s country house, a little brook\r\nflowed through the wood, and likewise ran over a rock. The attentive\r\nMr. Bartram here shewed me several little cavities in the rock, and we\r\nplainly saw that they must have been generated in the manner I before\r\ndescribed, that is, by supposing a pebble to have remained in a cleft\r\nof the rock, and to have been turned round by the violence of the\r\nwater, till it had formed such cavity in the mountain. For on putting\r\nour hands into one of these cavities, we found that it contained\r\nnumerous small pebbles, whose surface was quite smooth and round. And\r\nthese stones we found in each of the holes.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram shewed me a number of plants which he had collected into a\r\nherbal on his travels. Among these were the following, which likewise\r\ngrow in the northern parts of Europe, of which he had either got the\r\nwhole plants, or only broken branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Betula alba. The common birch tree, which he had found on the\r\n       cats-hills.\r\n    2. Betula nana. This species of birch grows in several low places\r\n       towards the hills.\r\n    3. Comarum palustre, in the meadows, between the hills in New\r\n       Jersey.\r\n    4. Gentiana lutea, the great Gentian, from the fields near the\r\n       mountains. It was very like our variety, but had not so many\r\n       flowers under each leaf.\r\n    5. Linnæa borealis, from the mountains in Canada. It creeps along\r\n       the ground.\r\n    6. Myrica Gale, from the neighbourhood of the river Susquehanna,\r\n       where it grows in a wet soil.\r\n    7. Potentilla fruticosa, from the swampy fields and low meadows,\r\n       between the river Delaware, and the river New York.\r\n    8. Trientalis Europæa, from the cats-hills.\r\n    9. Triglochin maritimum, from the salt springs towards the country\r\n       of the five nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram shewed me a letter from East Jersey, in which he got the\r\nfollowing account of the discovery of an Indian grave. In the April of\r\nthe year 1744, as some people were digging a cellar, they came upon a\r\ngreat stone, like a tombstone, which was at last got out with great\r\ndifficulty, and about four feet deeper under it, they met with a large\r\nquantity of human bones and a cake of maize. The latter was yet quite\r\nuntouched, and several of the people present tasted it out of\r\ncuriosity. From these circumstances it was concluded that this was a\r\ngrave of a person of note among the savages. For it is their custom to\r\nbury along with the deceased, meat any other things which he liked\r\nbest. The stone was eight feet long, four feet broad, and even some\r\ninches more where it was broadest, and fifteen inches thick at one end,\r\nbut only twelve inches at the other end. It consisted of the same\r\ncoarse kind of stone, that is to be got in this country. There were no\r\nletters nor other characters visible on it.\r\n\r\nThe corn which the Indians chiefly cultivate is the Maize, or Zea Mays,\r\nLinn. Then have little corn fields for that purpose. But besides this,\r\nthey likewise plant a great quantity of Squashes, a species of pumpions\r\nor melons, which they have always cultivated, even in the remotest\r\nages. The Europeans settled in America, got the seeds of this plant,\r\nand at present their gardens are full of it, the fruit has an agreeable\r\ntaste when it is well prepared. They are commonly boiled, then crushed\r\n(as we are used to do with turneps when we make a pulse of them) and\r\nsome pepper or other spice thrown upon them, and the dish is ready. The\r\nIndians likewise sow several kinds of beans, which for the greatest\r\npart they have got from the Europeans. But pease which they likewise\r\nsow, they have always had amongst them, before any foreigners came into\r\nthe country. The squashes of the Indians, which now are likewise\r\ncultivated by the Europeans, belong to those kinds of gourds\r\n(cucurbita,) which ripen before any other. They are a very delicious\r\nfruit, but will not keep. I have however seen them kept till pretty\r\nlaid In winter.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 30th. Wheat and rye are sown in autumn about this time,\r\nand commonly reaped towards the end of June, or in the beginning of\r\nJuly. These kinds of corn, however, are sometimes ready to be reaped in\r\nthe middle of June, and there are even examples that they have been\r\nmown in the beginning of that month. Barley and oats are sown in April,\r\nand they commonly begin to grow ripe towards the end of July.\r\nBuck-wheat is sown in the middle or at the end of July, and is about\r\nthis time, or somewhat later, ready to be reaped. If it be sown before\r\nthe above-mentioned time, as in May, or in June, it only gives flowers,\r\nand little or no corn.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram and other people assured me, that most of the cows which\r\nthe English have here, are the offspring of those which they bought of\r\nthe Swedes when they were masters of the country. The English\r\nthemselves are said to have brought over but few. The Swedes either\r\nbrought their cattle from home, or bought them of the Dutch, who were\r\nthen settled here.\r\n\r\nNear the town, I saw an Ivy or Hedera Helix, planted against the wall\r\nof a stone building, which was so covered by the fine green leaves of\r\nthis plant, as almost to conceal the whole. It was doubtless brought\r\nover from Europe, for I have never perceived it any where else on my\r\ntravels through North-America. But in its stead I have often seen wild\r\nvines made to run up the walls.\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Bartram, whether he had observed, that trees and plants\r\ndecreased in proportion as they were brought further to the North, as\r\nCatesby pretends? He answered, that the question should be more\r\nlimited, and then his opinion would prove the true one. There are some\r\ntrees which grow better in southern countries, and become less as you\r\nadvance to the north. Their seeds or berries are sometimes brought into\r\ncolder climates by birds and by other accidents. They gradually\r\ndecrease in growth, till at last they will not grow at all. On the\r\nother hand, there are other trees and herbs which the wise Creator\r\ndestined for the northern countries, and they grow there to an amazing\r\nsize. But the further they are transplanted to the south, the less they\r\ngrow; till at last they degenerate so much as not to be able to grow at\r\nall. Other plants love a temperate climate, and if they be carried\r\neither south or north, they will not succeed well, but always decrease.\r\nThus for example Pensylvania contains some trees which grow exceedingly\r\nwell, but always decrease in proportion as they are carried further off\r\neither to the north, or to the south.\r\n\r\nI afterwards on my travels, had frequent proofs of this truth. The\r\nSassafras, which grows in Pensylvania, under forty deg. of lat. and\r\nbecomes a pretty tall and thick tree, was so little at Oswego and Fort\r\nNicholson, between forty-three. and forty-four deg. of lat. that it\r\nhardly reached the height of two or four feet, and was seldom so thick\r\nas the little finger of a full grown person. This was likewise the case\r\nwith the Tulip tree. For in Pensylvania it grows as high as our tallest\r\noaks and firs, and its thickness is proportionable to its height. But\r\nabout Oswego it was not above twelve feet high, and no thicker than a\r\nman’s arm. The Sugar Maple, or Acer saccharinum, is one of the most\r\ncommon trees in the woods of Canada, and grows very tall. But in the\r\nsouthern provinces, as New Jersey and Pensylvania, it only grows on the\r\nnorthern side of the blue mountains, and on the steep hills which are\r\non the banks of the river, and which are turned to the north. Yet there\r\nit does not attain to a third or fourth part of the height which it has\r\nin Canada. It is needless to mention more examples.\r\n\r\nOctober the 1st. The gnats which are very troublesome at night here,\r\nare called Musquetoes. They are exactly like the gnats in Sweden, only\r\nsomewhat less, and the description which is to be met with in Dr.\r\nLinnæus’s Systema Naturæ, and Fauna Suecica, fully agrees with them,\r\nand they are called by him Culex pipiens. In day time or at night they\r\ncome into the houses, and when the people are gone to bed they begin\r\ntheir disagreeable humming, approach always nearer to the bed, and at\r\nlast suck up so much blood, that they can hardly fly away. Their bite\r\ncauses blisters in people of a delicate complexion. When the weather\r\nhas been cool for some days, the musquetoes disappear. But when it\r\nchanges again, and especially after a rain, they gather frequently in\r\nsuch quantities about the houses, that their numbers are astonishing.\r\nThe chimneys of the English which have no valves for shutting them up,\r\nafford the gnats a free entrance into the houses. In sultry evenings,\r\nthey accompany the cattle in great swarms, from the woods to the houses\r\nor to town, and when they are drove before the houses, the gnats fly in\r\nwherever they can. In the greatest heat of summer, they are so numerous\r\nin some places, that the air seems to be quite full of them, especially\r\nnear swamps and stagnant waters, such as the river Morris in New\r\nJersey. The inhabitants therefore make a fire before their houses to\r\nexpell these disagreeable guests by the smoak. The old Swedes here,\r\nsaid that gnats had formerly been much more numerous; that even at\r\npresent they swarmed in vast quantities on the sea shore near the salt\r\nwater, and that those which troubled us this autumn in Philadelphia\r\nwere of a more venomous kind, than they commonly used to be. This last\r\nquality appeared from the blisters, which were formed on the spots,\r\nwhere the gnats had inserted their sting. In Sweden I never felt any\r\nother inconvenience from their sting, than a little itching; whilst\r\nthey sucked. But when they stung me here at night, my face was so\r\ndisfigured by little red spots and blisters, that I was almost ashamed\r\nto shew myself.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned somewhat about the enclosures usual here; I\r\nnow add, that most of the planks which are put horizontally, and of\r\nwhich the enclosures in the environs of Philadelphia chiefly consist,\r\nare of the red cedar wood, which is here reckoned more durable than any\r\nother. But where this could not be got, either white or black oak\r\nsupplied its place. The people were likewise very glad if they could\r\nget cedar wood for the posts, or else they took white oak, or chesnut,\r\nas I was told by Mr. Bartram. But it seems that that kind of wood in\r\ngeneral does not keep well in the ground for a considerable time. I saw\r\nsome posts made of chesnut wood, and put into the ground only the year\r\nbefore, which were already for the greatest part rotten below.\r\n\r\nThe Sassafras tree, or Laurus Sassafras, Linn. grows in abundance in\r\nthe country, and stands scattered up and down the woods, and near\r\nbushes and enclosures. On old grounds, which are left uncultivated, it\r\nis one of the first that comes up, and is as plentiful as young birches\r\nare on those Swedish fields, which are formed by burning the trees\r\nwhich grew on them. [25] The sassafras grows in a dry loose ground, of\r\na pale brick colour, which consists for the greatest part of sand,\r\nmixed with some clay. It seems to be but a poor soil. The mountains\r\nround Gothenburgh, in Sweden, would afford many places rich enough for\r\nthe Sassafras to grow in, and I even fear they would be too rich. I\r\nhere saw it both in the woods amidst other trees, and more frequently\r\nby itself along the enclosures. In both it looks equally fresh. I have\r\nnever seen it on wet or low places. The people here gather its flowers,\r\nand use them instead of tea. But the wood itself is of no use in\r\nœconomy; for when it is set on fire, it causes a continual crackling,\r\nwithout making any good fire. The tree spreads its roots very much, and\r\nnew shoots come up from them in some places; but these shoots are not\r\ngood for transplanting, because they have so few fibres besides the\r\nroot, which connects them to the main stem, that they cannot well\r\nstrike into the ground. If therefore any one would plant Sassafras\r\ntrees he must endeavour to get their berries, which however is\r\ndifficult, since the birds eat them before they are half ripe. The cows\r\nare very greedy after the tender new shoots, and look for them every\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nThe bark of this tree is used by the women here in dying worsted a fine\r\nlasting orange colour, which does not fade in the sun. They use urine\r\ninstead of alum in dying, and boil the dye in a brass boiler, because\r\nin an iron vessel it does not yield so fine a colour. A woman in\r\nVirginia has successfully employed the berries of the Sassafras against\r\na great pain in one of her feet, which for three years together she had\r\nto such a degree, that it almost hindered her from walking. She was\r\nadvised to broil the berries of sassafras, and to rub the painful parts\r\nof her foot with the oil, which by this means would be got from the\r\nberries. She did so, but at the same time it made her vomit; yet this\r\nwas not sufficient to keep her from following the prescription three\r\ntimes more, though as often as she made use thereof, it always had the\r\nsame effect. However she was entirely freed from that pain, and\r\nperfectly recovered.\r\n\r\nA black Woodpecker with a red head, or the Picus pileatus, Linn. is\r\nfrequent in the Pensylvanian forests, and stays the winter, as I know\r\nfrom my own experience. It is reckoned among those birds which destroy\r\nthe maize; because it settles on the ripe ears, and destroys them with\r\nits bill. The Swedes call it Tillkroka, but all other woodpeckers,\r\nthose with gold yellow wings excepted, are called Hackspickar in the\r\nSwedish language. I intend to describe them altogether more exactly in\r\na particular work. I only observe here, that almost all the different\r\nspecies of woodpeckers are very noxious to the maize, when it begins to\r\nripen: for by picking holes in the membrane round the ear, the rain\r\ngets into it, and causes the ear with all the corn it contains to rot.\r\n\r\nOctober the 3d. In the morning I set out for Wilmington, which was\r\nformerly called Christina by the Swedes, and is thirty English miles to\r\nthe south west of Philadelphia. Three miles behind Philadelphia I\r\npassed the river Skulkill in a ferry, beyond which the country appears\r\nalmost a continual chain of mountains and vallies. The mountains have\r\nan easy slope on all sides, and the vallies are commonly crossed by\r\nbrooks with crystal streams. The greater part of the country is covered\r\nwith several kinds of deciduous trees; for I scarcely saw a single tree\r\nof the fir kind, if I except a few red cedars. The forest was high, but\r\nopen below, so that it left a free prospect to the eye, and no\r\nunder-wood obstructed the passage between the trees. It would have been\r\neasy in some places to have gone under the branches with a carriage for\r\na quarter of a mile, the trees standing at great distances from each\r\nother, and the ground being very level. In some places little glades\r\nopened, which were either meadows, pastures, or corn-fields; of which\r\nlatter some were cultivated and others not. In a few places, several\r\nhouses were built close to each other. But for the greatest part they\r\nwere single. In part of the fields the wheat was already sown, in the\r\nEnglish manner without trenches, but with furrows pretty close\r\ntogether. I sometimes saw the country people very busy in sowing their\r\nrye. Near every farm-house was a little field with maize. The\r\ninhabitants hereabouts were commonly either English or Swedes.\r\n\r\nAll the day long I saw a continual variety of trees; walnut trees of\r\ndifferent sorts, which were all full of nuts; chesnut trees quite\r\ncovered with fine chesnuts; mulberries, sassafras, liquidambar, tulip\r\ntrees, and many others.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of vines grew wild hereabouts. They run up to the\r\nsummits of the trees, their clusters of grapes and their leaves\r\ncovering the stems. I even saw some young oaks five or six fathoms\r\nhigh, whose tops were crowned with vines. The ground is that which is\r\nso common hereabouts, which I have already described, viz. a clay mixed\r\nwith a great quantity of sand, and covered with a rich soil or\r\nvegetable earth. The vines are principally seen on trees which stand\r\nsingle in corn-fields, and at the end of woods, where the meadows,\r\npastures, and fields begin, and likewise along the enclosures, where\r\nthey cling with their tendrils round the trees which stand there. The\r\nlower parts of the plant are full of grapes, which hang below the\r\nleaves, and were now almost ripe, and had a pleasant sourish taste. The\r\ncountry people gather them in great quantities, and sell them in the\r\ntown. They are eaten without further preparation, and commonly people\r\nare presented with them when they come to pay a visit.\r\n\r\nThe soil does not seem to be deep hereabouts; for the upper black\r\nstratum is hardly two inches. This I had an occasion to see both in\r\nsuch places where the ground is dug up, and in such where the water,\r\nduring heavy flowers of rain, has made cuts, which are pretty numerous\r\nhere. The upper soil has a dark colour, and the next a pale colour like\r\nbricks. I have observed everywhere in America, that the depth of the\r\nupper soil does not by far agree with the computation of some people,\r\nthough we can almost be sure, that in some places it never was stirred\r\nsince the deluge. I shall be more particular in this respect\r\nafterwards. [26]\r\n\r\nThe Datura Stramonium, or Thorn Apple, grows in great quantities near\r\nall the villages. Its height is different according to the soil it is\r\nin. For in a rich soil it grows eight or ten feet high, but in a hard\r\nand poor ground, it will seldom come up to six inches. This Datura,\r\ntogether with the Phytolacca, or American Nightshade, grow here in\r\nthose places near the gardens, houses, and roads, which in Sweden are\r\ncovered with nettles and goose-foot, which European plants are very\r\nscarce in America. But the Datura and Phytolacca are the worst weeds\r\nhere, nobody knowing any particular use of them.\r\n\r\nTurnep-fields are sometimes to be seen. In the middle of the highroad I\r\nperceived a dead black snake, which was four feet six inches long, and\r\nan inch and a half in thickness. It belonged to the viper kind.\r\n\r\nLate at night a great Halo appeared round the moon. The people said\r\nthat it prognosticated either a storm, or rain, or both together. The\r\nsmaller the ring is, or the nearer it comes to the moon, the sooner\r\nthis weather sets in. But this time neither of these changes happened,\r\nand the halo had foretold a coldness in the air.\r\n\r\nI saw to-day the Chermes of the alder (Chermes Alni) in great abundance\r\non the branches of that tree, which for that reason looks quite white,\r\nand at a distance appears as it were covered with mould.\r\n\r\nOctober the 4th. I continued my journey early in the morning, and the\r\ncountry still had the same appearance as I went on. It was a continual\r\nchain of pretty high hills, with an easy ascent on all sides, and of\r\nvallies between them. The soil consisted of a brick coloured mould,\r\nmixed with clay, and a few pebbles, I rode sometimes through woods of\r\nseveral sorts of trees, and sometimes amidst little fields, which had\r\nbeen cleared of the wood, and which at present were corn-fields,\r\nmeadows, and pastures. The farm-houses stood single, sometimes near the\r\nroads, and sometimes at a little distance from them, so that the space\r\nbetween the road and the houses was taken up with little fields and\r\nmeadows. Some of the houses were built of stone, two stories high, and\r\ncovered with shingles of the white cedar. But most of the houses were\r\nwooden, and the crevices stopped up with clay, instead of moss, which\r\nwe make use of for that purpose. No valves were to be met with in the\r\nchimneys, and the people even did not know what I meant by them. The\r\novens were commonly built up at some distance from the houses, and were\r\neither under a roof, or without any covering against the weather. The\r\nfields bore partly buck-wheat, which was not yet cut, partly maize, and\r\npartly wheat, which was but lately sown; but sometimes they lay fallow.\r\nThe vines climbed to the top of several trees, and hung down again on\r\nboth sides. Other trees again were surrounded by the ivy (Hedera\r\nquinquefolia) which with the same flexibility ascended to a great\r\nheight. The Smilax laurifolia always joined with the ivy, and together\r\nwith it twisted itself round the trees. The leaves of the ivy were at\r\nthis time commonly reddish, but those of the vine were still quite\r\ngreen. The trees which were surrounded with them, looked at a distance\r\nlike those which are covered with hops in our country, (and on seeing\r\nthem from afar off, one might expect to find wild hops climbing upon\r\nthe trees.) Walnut and chesnut trees were common near enclosures, in\r\nwoods, and on hills, and at present were loaded with their fruit. The\r\npersimon was likewise plentiful near the roads, and in the woods. It\r\nhad a great quantity of fruit, but they were not yet fit for eating,\r\nsince the frost had not softened them. At some distance from\r\nWilmington, I passed a bridge over a little river, which falls north\r\ninto the Delaware. The rider pays here twopence toll for himself and\r\nhis horse.\r\n\r\nTowards noon I arrived at Wilmington.\r\n\r\nWilmington is a little town, about thirty English miles south-west from\r\nPhiladelphia. It was founded in the year 1733. Part of it stands upon\r\nthe grounds belonging to the Swedish church, which annually receives\r\ncertain rents, out of which they pay the minister’s salary, and employ\r\nthe rest for other uses. The houses are built of stone, and look very\r\npretty; yet they are not built close together, but large open places\r\nare left between them. The quakers have a meeting-house in this town.\r\nThe Swedish church, which I intend to mention in the sequel, is half a\r\nmile out of town eastwards. The parsonage is under the same roof with\r\nthe church. A little river called Christina-kill passes by the town,\r\nand from thence falls into the Delaware. By following its banks one\r\ngoes three miles before one reaches the Delaware. The river is said to\r\nbe sufficiently deep, so that the greatest vessel may come quite up to\r\nthe town: for at its mouth or juncture with the Delaware, it is\r\nshallowest, and yet its depth even there when the water is lowest, is\r\nfrom two fathoms to two and a half. But as you go higher its depth\r\nencreases to three, three and a half, and even four fathoms. The\r\nlargest ships therefore may safely, and with their full cargoes come\r\nto, and from the town with the tide. from Wilmington, you have a fine\r\nprospect of a great part of the river Delaware, and the ships sailing\r\non it. On both sides of the river Christina-kill, almost from the place\r\nwhere the redoubt is built to its juncture with the Delaware, are low\r\nmeadows, which afford a great quantity of hay to the inhabitants. The\r\ntown carries on a considerable trade, and would have been more\r\nenlarged, if Philadelphia and Newcastle, which are both towns of a more\r\nancient date, were not so near on both sides of it.\r\n\r\nThe Redoubt upon the river Christina-kill, was erected this summer,\r\nwhen it was known that the French and Spanish privateers intended to\r\nsail up the river, and to attempt a landing. It stands, according to\r\nthe accounts of the late Rev. Mr. Tranberg, on the same spot, where the\r\nSwedes had built theirs. It is remarkable, that on working in the\r\nground this summer, to make this redoubt, an old Swedish silver coin of\r\nQueen Christina, not quite so big as a shilling was found at the depth\r\nof a yard, among some other things. The Rev. Mr. Tranberg afterwards\r\npresented me with it. On one side were the arms of the house of Wasa\r\nwith the inscription: CHRISTINA, D. G. DE. RE. SVE. that is, Christina,\r\nby the grace of God, elected Queen of Sweden; and near this the year of\r\nour Lord 1633. On the reverse were these words: MONETA NOVA REGNI SVEC.\r\nor, a new coin of the kingdom of Sweden. At the same time a number of\r\nold iron tools, such as axes, shovels, and the like, were discovered.\r\nThe redoubt, that is now erected, consists of bulwarks of planks, with\r\na rampart on the outside. Near it is the powder magazine, in a vault\r\nbuilt of bricks. At the erection of this little fortification it was\r\nremarkable, that the quakers, whose tenets reject even defensive war,\r\nwere as busy as the other people in building it. For the fear of being\r\nevery moment suddenly attacked by privateers, conquered all other\r\nthoughts. Many of them scrupled to put their own hands to the work; but\r\nforwarded, it by supplies of money, and by getting ready every thing,\r\nwhich was necessary.\r\n\r\nOctober the 5th. It was my design to cross the Delaware, and to get\r\ninto New Jersey with a view to get acquainted with the country; but as\r\nthere was no ferry here to bring my horse over, I set out on my return\r\nto Philadelphia. I partly went along the high road, and partly deviated\r\non one or the other side of it, in order to take more exact\r\nobservations of the country, and of its natural history.\r\n\r\nThe maize, was sown in several places. In some its stalks were cut\r\nsomewhat below the ear, dried and put up in narrow high stacks, in\r\norder to keep them as a food for the cattle in winter. The lower part\r\nof the stalk had likewise leaves, but as they commonly dry of\r\nthemselves, the people do not like to feed the cattle with them, all\r\ntheir flavour being lost: But the upper ones are cut, whilst they are\r\nyet green.\r\n\r\nThe vallies between the hills commonly contain brooks: but they are not\r\nvery broad, and require no bridges, so that carriages and horse can\r\neasily pass through them, for the water is seldom above six inches\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of most trees were yet quite green, such as those of oaks,\r\nchesnut trees, black walnut trees, hiccory, tulip trees, and sassafras.\r\nThe two latter species are found in plenty on the sides of the little\r\nwoods, on hills, on the fallow fields, near hedges, and on the road.\r\nThe persimon likewise had still its leaves; however some trees of this\r\nkind had dropt them. The leaves of the American bramble were at present\r\nalmost entirely red, though some of these bushes yet retained a lively\r\ngreen in the leaves. The Cornelian cherry likewise had already a\r\nmixture of brown and pale leaves. The leaves of the red maple were also\r\nred.\r\n\r\nI continued my journey to Chichester, a borough upon the Delaware,\r\nwhere travellers pass the river in a ferry. They build here every year\r\na number of small ships for sale. From an iron work which lies higher\r\nin the country, they carry iron bars to this place, and ship them.\r\n\r\nCanoes are boats made of one piece of wood, and are much in use with\r\nthe farmers, and other people upon the Delaware, and some little\r\nrivers. For that purpose a very thick trunk of a tree is hollowed out;\r\nthe red juniper or red cedar tree, the white cedar, the chesnut tree,\r\nthe white oak, and the tulip tree are commonly made use of for this\r\npurpose. The canoes made of red and white cedar are reckoned the best,\r\nbecause they swim very light upon the water, and last twenty years\r\ntogether. But of these, the red cedar canoes are most preferable. Those\r\nmade of chesnut trees will likewise last for a good while. But those of\r\nwhite oak are hardly serviceable above six years, and also swim deep,\r\nbecause they are so heavy. The Liquidambar tree, or Liquidambar\r\nstyraciflua, Linn. is big enough but unfit making canoes, because it\r\nimbibes the water. The canoes which are made of the tulip tree, scarce\r\nlast as long as those of white oak. The size of the canoes is\r\ndifferent, according to the purposes they are destined for. They can\r\ncarry six persons; who however, must by no means be unruly, but sit at\r\nthe bottom of the canoe in the quietest manner possible, lest the boat\r\noverset. The Swedes in Pensylvania and New Jersey near the rivers, have\r\nno other boats to go to Philadelphia in, which they commonly do twice a\r\nweek on the market days, though they be several miles distant from the\r\ntown, and meet sometimes with severe storms; yet misfortunes from the\r\noversetting, &c; of these canoes are seldom heard of, though they might\r\nwell be expected on account of the small size of this kind of boats.\r\nHowever a great deal of attention and care is necessary in managing the\r\ncanoes, when the wind is somewhat violent; for they are narrow, round\r\nbelow, have no keel, and therefore may easily be overset. Accordingly\r\nwhen the wind is more brisk than ordinary, the people make for the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe common garden cresses grow in several places on the roads about\r\nChichester, and undoubtedly come from the seeds, which were by chance\r\ncarried out of the many gardens about that town.\r\n\r\nThe American brambles are here in great plenty. When a field is left\r\nuncultivated, they are the first plants that appear on it; and I\r\nfrequently observed them in such fields as are annually ploughed, and\r\nhave corn sown on them. For when these bushes are once rooted, they are\r\nnot easily extirpated. Such a bush runs out tendrils sometimes four\r\nfathoms off its root, and then throws a new root, so that on pulling it\r\nup, you meet with roots on both ends. On some old grounds, which had\r\nlong been uncultivated, there were so many bushes of this kind, that it\r\nwas very troublesome and dangerous walking in them. A wine is made of\r\nthe berries, as I have already mentioned. The berries are likewise\r\neaten when they are ripe, and taste well. No other use is made of them.\r\n\r\nOctober the 6th. The Chenopodium anthelminticum is very plentiful on\r\nthe road, and on the banks of the river, but chiefly in dry places in a\r\nloose sandy soil. The English who are settled here, call it Wormseed\r\nand Jerusalem Oak. It has a disagreeable scent. In Pensylvania and New\r\nJersey its seeds are given to children, against the worms, and for that\r\npurpose they are excellent. The plant itself is spontaneous in both\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nThe environs of Chichester, contain many gardens, which are full of\r\napple trees, sinking under the weight of innumerable apples. Most of\r\nthem are winter fruit, and therefore were yet quite sour. Each farm has\r\na garden, and so has each house of the better sort. The extent of these\r\ngardens is likewise not inconsiderable, and therefore affords, the\r\npossessor all the year long, great supplies in his house-keeping, both\r\nfor eating and drinking. I frequently was surprized at the prudence of\r\nthe inhabitants of this country. As soon as one has bought a piece of\r\nground, which is neither built upon nor sown, his first care is to get\r\nyoung apple trees, and to make a garden. He next proceeds to build his\r\nhouse, and lastly prepares the uncultivated ground to receive corn. For\r\nit is well known that the trees require many years before they arrive\r\nto perfection, and this makes it necessary to plant them first. I now\r\nperceived near the farms, mills, wheels, and other instruments which\r\nare made use of in crushing the apples, in order to prepare cyder from\r\nthem afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrom Chichester I went on towards Philadelphia. The oaks were the most\r\nplentiful trees in the wood. But there were several species of them,\r\nall different from the European ones. The swine now went about in great\r\nherds in the oak woods, where they fed upon the acorns which fell in\r\ngreat abundance from the trees. Each hog had a wooden triangular yoke\r\nabout its neck, by which it was hindered from penetrating through the\r\nholes in the enclosures; and for this reason, the enclosures are made\r\nvery slender, and easy to put up, and do not require much wood. No\r\nother enclosures are in use, but those which are so like sheep hurdles.\r\nA number of squirrels were in the oak woods, partly running on the\r\nground, and partly leaping from one branch to another; and at this time\r\nthey chiefly fed upon acorns.\r\n\r\nI seldom saw beach trees; but I found them quite the same with the\r\nEuropean ones. Their wood is reckoned very good for making joiner’s\r\nplanes of.\r\n\r\nI do not remember seeing any other than the black Ants, or Formica\r\nnigra in Pensylvania. They are as black as a coal, and of two sorts,\r\nsome very little, like the least of our ants, and others of the size of\r\nour common reddish ants. I have not yet observed any hills of theirs,\r\nbut only seen some running about singly. In other parts of America, I\r\nhave likewise found other species of ants, as I intend to remark in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\nThe common Privet, or Ligustrum vulgare, is made use of in many places,\r\nas a hedge round corn-fields and gardens, and on my whole voyage, I did\r\nnot see that any other trees were made use of for this purpose, though\r\nthe Englishmen here, well know that the hawthorn makes a much better\r\nhedge. The privet hedges grow very thick and close, but having no\r\nspines, the hogs, and even other animals break easily through them; and\r\nwhen they have once made a hole, it requires a long while before it\r\ngrows up again. But when the hedges consist of spinose bushes, the\r\ncattle will hardly attempt to get through them.\r\n\r\nAbout noon I came through Chester, a little market-town which lies on\r\nthe Delaware. A rivulet coming down out of the country, passes through\r\nthis place, and discharges itself into the Delaware. There is a bridge\r\nover it. The houses stand dispersed. Most of them are built of stone,\r\nand two or three stories high; some are however made of wood. In the\r\ntown is a church, and a market-place.\r\n\r\nWheat was now sown every where. In some places it was already green,\r\nhaving been sown four weeks before. The wheat fields were made in the\r\nEnglish manner, having no ditches in them, but numerous furrows for\r\ndraining the water, at the distance of four or six foot from one\r\nanother. Great stumps of the trees which had been cut down, are every\r\nwhere seen on the fields, and this shews that the country has been but\r\nlately cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe roots of the trees do not go deep into the ground, but spread\r\nhorizontally. I had opportunities of observing this in several places\r\nwhere the trees were dug up; for I seldom saw one, whose roots went\r\nabove a foot deep into the ground, though it was a loose soil.\r\n\r\nAbout two English miles behind Chester, I passed by an iron forge,\r\nwhich was to the right hand by the road side. It belonged to two\r\nbrothers, as I was told. The ore however is not dug here, but thirty or\r\nforty miles from hence, where it is first melted in the oven, and then\r\ncarried to this place. The bellows were made of leather, and both they\r\nand the hammers, and even the hearth, but small in proportion to ours.\r\nAll the machines were worked by water. The iron was wrought into bars.\r\n\r\nTo day I remarked, as I have since frequently seen on my travels in\r\nthis country, that horses are very greedy of apples. When they are let\r\ninto an orchard to feed upon the grass, if there are any apples on the\r\nground, they frequently leave the fresh green grass, and eat the\r\napples, which, however, are not reckoned a good food for them; and\r\nbesides that, it is too expensive.\r\n\r\nThe red Maple, or Acer rubrum is plentiful in these places. Its proper\r\nsituations are chiefly swampy, wet places, in which the alder commonly\r\nis its companion. Out of its wood they make plates, spinning-wheels,\r\nrolls, feet for chairs and beds, and all sorts of work. With the bark,\r\nthey dye both worsted and linnen, giving it a dark blue colour. For\r\nthat purpose it is first boiled in water; and some copperas, such as\r\nthe hat-makers and shoe-makers commonly make use of, is added, before\r\nthe stuff (which is to be dyed) is put into the boiler. This bark\r\nlikewise affords a good black ink. When the tree is felled early in\r\nspring, a sweet juice runs out of it, like that which runs out of our\r\nbirches. This juice they do not make any use of here, but in Canada,\r\nthey make both treacle and sugar of it. Here is a variety of this tree\r\nwhich they call the curled Maple, the wood being as it were marbled\r\nwithin; it is much used in all kinds of joiner’s work, and the utensils\r\nmade of this wood, are preferable to those made of any other sort of\r\nwood in the country, and are much dearer than those made of the wood of\r\nthe wild cherry trees (Prunus Virginiana) or of black walnut trees. But\r\nthe most valuable utensils were those made of curled black walnut, for\r\nthat is an excessive scarce kind of wood. The curled maple was likewise\r\nvery uncommon, and you frequently find trees, whose outsides are\r\nmarbled, but their inside not. The tree is therefore cut very deep\r\nbefore it is felled, to see whether it has veins in every part.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I reached Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOctober the 7th. In the morning we crossed the Delaware in a boat to\r\nthe other side which belongs to New Jersey, each person paying\r\nfourpence for his passage. The country here is very different from that\r\nin Pensylvania; for here the ground is almost mere sand, but in the\r\nother province it is mixed with a good deal of clay, and this makes the\r\nground pretty rich. The discoveries which I made to day of insects and\r\nplants, I intend to mention in another work.\r\n\r\nA soil like this in New Jersey, one might be led to think, could\r\nproduce nothing because it is so dry and poor. Yet the maize which is\r\nplanted on it grows extremely well, and we saw many fields filled with\r\nit. The earth is of that kind in which tobacco commonly succeeds, but\r\nit is not near so rich. The stalks of maize are commonly eight feet\r\nhigh, more or less, and are full of leaves. The maize is planted as\r\nusual in rows, in little squares, so that there is a space of five feet\r\nand six inches between each square, both in length and breadth; on each\r\nof these little hills three or four stalks come up, which were not yet\r\ncut for the cattle; each stalk again has from one to four ears, which\r\nare large and full of corn. A sandy ground could never have been better\r\nemployed. In some places the ground between the maize is ploughed, and\r\nrye sown in it, so that when the maize is cut, the rye remains upon the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nWe frequently saw Asparagus growing near the enclosures, in a loose\r\nsoil, on uncultivated sandy fields. It is likewise plentiful between\r\nthe maize, and was at present full of berries, but I cannot tell\r\nwhether the seeds are carried by the wind to the places where I saw\r\nthem; it is however certain, that I have likewise seen it growing wild\r\nin other parts of America.\r\n\r\nThe Worm-seed, is likewise plentiful on the roads, in a sandy ground\r\nsuch as that near the ferry opposite to Philadelphia. I have already\r\nmentioned that it is given to children, as a remedy to carry off the\r\nworms. It is then put into brandy, and when it has been in it for one\r\nhour, it is taken out again, dried and given to the children, either in\r\nbeer sweetened with treacle, or in any other liquor. Its effects talked\r\nof differently. Some people say it kills the worms, others again\r\npretend that it forwards their encrease. But I know by my own\r\nexperience, that this wormseed has had very good effects upon children.\r\n\r\nThe Purslain, which we cultivate in our gardens, grows wild in great\r\nabundance in the loose soil amongst the maize. It was there creeping on\r\nthe ground, and its stalks were pretty thick and succulent; which\r\ncircumstance very justly gave reason to wonder from whence it could get\r\njuice sufficient to supply it in such a dry ground. It is to be found\r\nplentiful in such soil, in other places of this country.\r\n\r\nThe Bidens bipinnata, is here called Spanish Needles. It grows single\r\nabout farm houses, near roads, pales and along the hedges. It was yet\r\npartly in flower; but for the greatest part it was already out of\r\nblossom. When its seeds are ripe it is very disagreeable walking where\r\nit grows. For they stick to the cloaths and make them black; and it is\r\ndifficult to discharge the black spots which they occasion. Each seed\r\nhas three spines at its extremity; and each of these again is full of\r\nnumerous little hooks, by which the seed fastens itself to the cloaths.\r\n\r\nIn the woods and along the hedges in this neighbourhood, some single\r\nred Ants, (Formica rubra) crept about, and their antennæ or feel-horns\r\nwere as long as their bodies.\r\n\r\nTowards night we returned to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOctober the 8th. The shore of Pensylvania has a great quantity of the\r\nfinest oysters. About this time the people began to bring them to\r\nPhiladelphia for sale. They come from that part of the shore, which is\r\nnear the mouth of the river Delaware. They are reckoned as good as the\r\nNew York oysters, of which I shall make more particular mention\r\nafterwards. However I thought that this latter sort of oysters was\r\ngenerally larger, fatter and more palatable. It is remarkable that they\r\ncommonly became palatable at the time when the agues had left off their\r\nfury. Some men went with whole carts full of oysters, crying them about\r\nthe streets; this is unusual here when any thing else is to be sold,\r\nbut in London it is very common. The oyster shells are thrown away,\r\nthough formerly a lime was burnt from them, which has been found\r\nunnecessary, there being stones for burning of lime in this\r\nneighbourhood, and the lime of oyster shells not being as good as this\r\nother lime. The people shewed me some of houses in this town which were\r\nbuilt of stone, and to the mason work of which the lime of oyster\r\nshells had been employed. The walls of these houses were always so wet\r\ntwo or three days before a rain, that great drops of water could\r\nplainly be perceived on them; and thus they were as good as\r\nHygrometers. [27] Several people who had lived in this kind of houses\r\ncomplained of these inconveniences.\r\n\r\nOctober the 9th. Pease are not much cultivated in Pensylvania at\r\npresent, though formerly, according to the accounts of some old Swedes,\r\nevery farmer had a little field with pease. In New Jersey and the\r\nsouthern parts of New York, pease are likewise not so much cultivated\r\nas they used to be. But in the northern parts of New York, or about\r\nAlbany, and in all the parts of Canada which are inhabited by the\r\nFrench, the people sow great quantities, and have a plentiful crop. In\r\nthe former colonies, a little despicable insect has obliged the people\r\nto give up so useful a part of agriculture. This little insect was\r\nformerly little known, but a few years ago it multiplied excessively.\r\nIt couples in summer, about the time when the pease are in blossom, and\r\nthen deposites an egg into almost every one of the little pease. When\r\nthe pease are ripe, their outward appearance does not discover the\r\nworm, which, however, is found within, when it is cut. This worm lies\r\nin the pea, if it is not stirred during all the winter, and part of the\r\nspring, and in that space of time consumes the greatest part of the\r\ninside of the pea: In spring therefore little more than the mere thin\r\noutward skin is left. This worm at last changes into an insect, of the\r\ncoleoptera class, and in that state creeps through a hole of its own\r\nmaking in the husk, and flies off, in order to look for new fields of\r\npease, in which it may couple with its cogeneric insects, and provide\r\nfood sufficient for its posterity.\r\n\r\nThis noxious insect has spread from Pensylvania to the north. For the\r\ncountry of New York, where it is common at present, has not been\r\nplagued with it above twelve or fifteen years ago; and before that time\r\nthe people sowed pease every year without any inconvenience, and had\r\nexcellent crops. But by degrees these little enemies came in such\r\nnumbers, that the inhabitants were forced to leave off sowing of pease.\r\nThe people complained of this in several places. The country people\r\nabout Albany have yet the pleasure to see their fields of pease not\r\ninfected by these beetles, but are always afraid of their approach; as\r\nit has been observed they come every year nearer to that province.\r\n\r\nI know not whether this insect would live in Europe, and I should think\r\nour Swedish winters must kill the worm, even if it be ever so deeply\r\ninclosed in the pea; notwithstanding it is often as cold in New York\r\n(where this insect is so abundant) as in our country, yet it continues\r\nto multiply here every year, and proceeds always farther to the north.\r\nI was very near bringing some of these vermin into Europe, without\r\nknowing of it. At my departure from America, I took some sweet peas\r\nwith me in a paper, and they were at that time quite fresh and green.\r\nBut on opening the paper after my arrival at Stockholm, on August the\r\n1st. 1751; I found all the peas hollow, and the head of an infect\r\npeeping out of each. Some of these insects even crept out, in order to\r\ntry the weather of this new climate; but I made haste, to shut the\r\npaper again, in order to prevent the spreading of this noxious insect.\r\n[28] I own, that when I first perceived them, I was more frightened\r\nthan I should have been at the sight of a viper. For I at once had a\r\nfull view of the whole damage, which my dear country would have\r\nsuffered, if only two or three of these noxious insects had escaped me.\r\nThe posterity of many families, and even the inhabitants of whole\r\nprovinces, would have had sufficient reason to detest me as the cause\r\nof so great a calamity. I afterwards sent some of them, though well\r\nsecured, to count Tessin, and to Dr. Linnæus, together with an account\r\nof their destructive qualities. Dr. Linnæus has already inserted a\r\ndescription of them in an Academical Dissertation, which has been drawn\r\nup under his presidency, and treats of the damages made by insects.\r\n[29] He there calls this insect the Bruchus of North-America. [30] It\r\nwas very peculiar that every pea in the paper was eaten without\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nWhen the inhabitants of Pensylvania sow pease procured from abroad,\r\nthey are not commonly attacked by these insects for the first year; but\r\nin the next they take possession of the pea. It is greatly to be wished\r\nthat none of the ships which annually depart from New York or\r\nPensylvania, may bring them into the European countries. From hence the\r\npower of a single despicable insect will plainly appear; as also, that\r\nthe study of the œconomy and of the qualities of insects, is not to be\r\nlooked upon as a mere pastime and useless employment. [31]\r\n\r\nThe Rhus radicans is a shrub or tree which grows abundantly in this\r\ncountry, and has in common with the ivy, called Hedera arborea, the\r\nquality of not growing without the support either of a tree, a wall, or\r\na hedge. I have seen it climbing to the very top of high trees in the\r\nwoods, and its branches shoot out every where little roots, which\r\nfasten upon the tree and as it were enter into it. When the stem is\r\ncut, it emits a pale brown sap of a disagreeable scent. This sap is so\r\nsharp that the letters and characters made upon linnen with it, cannot\r\nbe got out again, but grow blacker the more the cloath is washed. Boys\r\ncommonly marked their names on their linnen with this juice. If you\r\nwrite with it on paper, the letters never go out, but grow blacker from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\nThis species of Sumach has the same noxious qualities as the poisonous\r\nsumach, or Poison-tree, which I have above described, being poisonous\r\nto some people, though not to every one. Therefore all that has been\r\nsaid of the poison tree is likewise applicable to this; excepting that\r\nthe former has the stronger poison. However I have seen people who have\r\nbeen as much swelled from the noxious exhalations of the latter, as\r\nthey could have been from those of the former. I likewise know that of\r\ntwo sisters, the one could manage the tree without being affected by\r\nits venom, though the other immediately felt it as soon as the\r\nexhalations of the tree came near her, or when ever she came a yard too\r\nnear the tree, and even when she stood in the way of the wind, which\r\nblew directly from this shrub. But upon me this species of sumach has\r\nnever exherted its power, though I made above a hundred experiments\r\nupon myself with the greatest stems, and the juice once squirted into\r\nmy eye, without doing me any harm. On another person’s hand which I had\r\ncovered very thick with it, the skin a few hours after became as hard\r\nas a piece of tanned leather, and peeled off in the following days, as\r\nif little scales fell from it.\r\n\r\nOctober the 10th. In the morning I accompanied Mr. Cock to his country\r\nseat, which is about nine miles from Philadelphia to the north.\r\n\r\nThough the woods of Pensylvania afford many oaks, and more species of\r\nthem than are found further north, yet they do not build so many ships\r\nin this province as they do in the northern ones, and especially in New\r\nEngland. But experience has taught the people that the same kind of\r\ntrees is more durable the further it grows to the north, and that this\r\nadvantage decreases the more it grows in warm climates. It is likewise\r\nplain that the trees in the south grow more every year, and form\r\nthicker ringlets than those in the north. The former have likewise much\r\ngreater tubes for the circulation of the sap than the latter. And for\r\nthis reason they do not build so many ships in Pensylvania, as they do\r\nin New England, though more than in Virginia and Maryland; but Carolina\r\nbuilds very few, and its merchants get all their ships from New\r\nEngland. Those which are here made of the best oak, hardly are\r\nserviceable above ten, or at most twelve years; for then they are so\r\nrotten, that no body ventures to go to sea in them, Many captains of\r\nships come over from England to North-America, in order to get ships\r\nbuilt. But most of them choose New England, that being the most\r\nnortherly province; and if they even come over in ships which are bound\r\nfor Philadelphia, they frequently on their arrival set out from\r\nPensylvania for New England. The Spaniards in the West Indies are said\r\nto build their ships of a peculiar sort of cedar, which holds out\r\nagainst putrefaction and wet; but it is not to be met with on the\r\ncontinent in the English provinces. Here are above nine different sorts\r\nof oak, but not one of them is comparable to the single species we have\r\nin Sweden, with regard to its goodness. And therefore a ship of\r\nEuropean oak costs a great deal more than one made of American oak.\r\n\r\nMany people who chiefly employed themselves in gardening, had found in\r\na succession of years, that the red Beet, which grew out of the seed\r\nwhich was got from New York, became very sweet and had a very fine\r\ntaste; but that it every year lost part of its goodness, if it was\r\ncultivated from seeds which were got here. The people were therefore\r\nobliged to get as many seeds of red beet every year from New York, as\r\nwere wanted in their gardens. It has likewise been generally observed,\r\nthat the plants which are produced from English seeds are always much\r\nbetter and more agreeable, than those which come from seeds of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn the garden of Mr. Cock was a raddish which was in the loose soil,\r\ngrown so big as to be seven inches in diameter. Every body that saw it,\r\nowned it was uncommon to see them of such a size.\r\n\r\nThat species of Convolvulus which is commonly called Batatas, has here\r\nthe name of Bermudian potatoes. The common people, and the gentry\r\nwithout distinction planted them in their gardens. This is done in the\r\nsame manner as with the common potatoes. Some people made little\r\nhillocks, into which they put these potatoes; but others only planted\r\nthem in flat beds. The soil must be a mixture of sand and earth, and\r\nneither too rich, nor too poor. When they are going to plant them, they\r\ncut them, as the common potatoes, taking care however that a bud or two\r\nbe left upon each piece which is intended to be planted. Their colour\r\nis commonly red without, and yellow within. They are bigger than the\r\ncommon sort, and have a sweet and very agreeable taste, which I cannot\r\nfind in the other potatoes, in artichokes or in any other root, and\r\nthey almost melt in the mouth. It is not long since they have been\r\nplanted here. They are dressed in the same manner as common potatoes,\r\nand eaten either along with them, or by themselves. They grow very fast\r\nand very well here; but the greatest difficulty consists in keeping\r\nthem over winter, for they will bear neither cold, nor a great heat,\r\nnor wet. They must therefore be kept during winter in a box with sand\r\nin a warm room. In Pensylvania where they have no valves in their\r\nchimnies, they are put in such a box with sand, at some distance from\r\nthe fire, and there they are secured both against frost and against\r\nover great heat. It will not answer the purpose to put them into dry\r\nsand in a cellar, as is commonly done with the common sort of potatoes.\r\nFor the moisture which is always in cellars, penetrates the sand, and\r\nmakes them putrefy. It would probably be very easy to keep them in\r\nSweden in warm rooms, during the cold season. But the difficulty lies\r\nwholly in bringing them over to Sweden. I carried a considerable number\r\nof them with me on leaving America, and took all possible care in\r\npreserving them. But we had a very violent storm at sea, by which the\r\nship was so greatly damaged, that the water got in every where, and\r\nwetted our cloaths, beds and other moveables so much, that we could\r\nwring the water out of them. It is therefore no wonder that my Bermuda\r\npotatoes were rotten; but as they are now cultivated in Portugal and\r\nSpain, nay even in England, it will be easy to bring them into Sweden.\r\nThe drink which the Spaniards prepare from these potatoes in their\r\nAmerican possessions is not usual in Pensylvania. [32]\r\n\r\nMr. Cock had a paper mill, on a little brook, and all the coarser sorts\r\nof paper are manufactured in it. It is now annually rented for fifty\r\npounds Pensylvania currency.\r\n\r\nOctober the 11th. I have already mentioned, that every countryman has a\r\ngreater or lesser number of apple trees planted round his farm-house,\r\nfrom whence he gets great quantities of fruit, part of which he sells,\r\npart he makes cyder of, and part he uses in his own family for pyes,\r\ntarts, and the like. However he cannot expect an equal quantity of\r\nfruit every year. And I was told, that this year had not by far\r\nafforded such a great quantity of apples as the preceding; the cause of\r\nwhich they told me, was the continual and great drought in the month of\r\nMay, which had hurt all the blossoms of the apple trees, and made them\r\nwither. The heat had been so great as to dry up all the plants, and the\r\ngrass in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe Polytrichum commune, a species of moss, grew plentifully on wet and\r\nlow meadows between the woods, and in several places quite covered\r\nthem, as our mosses cover the meadows in Sweden. It was likewise very\r\nplentiful on hills.\r\n\r\nAgriculture was in a very bad state hereabouts. When a person had\r\nbought a piece of land, which perhaps had never been ploughed since the\r\ncreation, he cut down part of the wood, tore up the roots, ploughed the\r\nground, sowed corn on it, and the first time got a plentiful crop. But\r\nthe same land being tilled for several years successively, without\r\nbeing manured, it at last must of course lose its fertility. Its\r\npossessor therefore leaves it fallow, and proceeds to another part of\r\nhis ground, which he treats in the same manner. Thus he goes on till he\r\nhas changed a great part of his possessions into corn-fields, and by\r\nthat means deprives the ground of its fertility. He then returns to the\r\nfirst field, which now is pretty well recovered; this he again tills as\r\nlong as it will afford him a good crop, but when its fertility is\r\nexhausted, he leaves it fallow again, and proceeds to the rest as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt being customary here, to let the cattle go about the fields and in\r\nthe woods both day and night, the people cannot collect much dung for\r\nmanure. But by leaving the land fallow for several years together, a\r\ngreat quantity of weeds spring up in it, and get such strength, that it\r\nrequires a considerable time to extirpate them. From hence it likewise\r\ncomes, that the corn is always so much mixed with weeds. The great\r\nrichness of the soil, which the first European colonists found here,\r\nand which had never been ploughed before, has given rise to this\r\nneglect of agriculture, which is still observed by many of the\r\ninhabitants. But they do not consider, that when the earth is quite\r\nexhausted, a great space of time, and an infinite deal of labour is\r\nnecessary to bring it again into good order; especially in these\r\ncountries which are almost every summer so scorched up by the excessive\r\nheat and drought. The soil of the corn-fields consisted of a thin\r\nmould, greatly mixed with a brick coloured clay, and a quantity of\r\nsmall particles of glimmer. This latter came from the stones which are\r\nhere almost every where to be met with at the depth of a foot or\r\nthereabouts. These little pieces of glimmer made the ground sparkle,\r\nwhen the sun shone upon it.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the houses hereabouts were built either of stone or bricks;\r\nbut those of stone were more numerous. Germantown, which is about two\r\nEnglish miles long, had no other houses, and the country houses\r\nthereabouts, were all built of stone. But there are several varieties\r\nof that stone which is commonly made use of in building. Sometimes it\r\nconsisted of a black or grey glimmer, running in undulated veins, the\r\nspaces between their bendings being filled up with a grey, loose,\r\nsmall-grained limestone, which was easily friable. Some transparent\r\nparticles of quartz were scattered in the mass, of which the glimmer\r\nmade the greatest part. It was very easy to be cut, and with proper\r\ntools could readily be shaped into any form. Sometimes however the\r\npieces consisted of a black, small-grained glimmer, a white\r\nsmall-grained sandstone, and some particles of quartz, and the several\r\nconstituent parts were well mixed together. Sometimes the stone had\r\nbroad stripes of the white limestone without any addition of glimmer.\r\nBut most commonly they were much blended together, and of a grey\r\ncolour. Sometimes this stone was found to consist of quite fine and\r\nblack pieces of glimmer, and a grey, loose and very small-grained\r\nlimestone. This was likewise very easy to be cut, being loose.\r\n\r\nThese varieties of the stone are commonly found close together. They\r\nwere every where to be met with, at a little depth, but not in equal\r\nquantity and goodness; and not always easy to be broken. When therefore\r\na person intended to build a house, he enquired where the best stone\r\ncould be met with. It is to be found on corn-fields and meadows, at a\r\ndepth which varies from two to six feet. The pieces were different as\r\nto size. Some were eight or ten feet long, two broad, and one thick.\r\nSometimes they were still bigger, but frequently much less. Hereabouts\r\nthey lay in strata one above another, the thickness of each stratum\r\nbeing about a foot. The length and breadth were different, but commonly\r\nsuch as I have before mentioned. They must commonly dig three or four\r\nfeet before they reach the first stratum. The loose ground above that\r\nstratum, is full of little pieces of this stone. This ground is the\r\ncommon brick coloured soil, which is universal here, and consists of\r\nsand and clay, though the former is more plentiful. The loose pieces of\r\nglimmer which shine so much in it, seem to have been broken off from\r\nthe great strata of stone.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that when the people build with this stone, they\r\ntake care to turn the flat side of it outwards. But as that cannot\r\nalways be done, the stone being frequently rough on all sides, it is\r\neasily cut smooth with tools, since it is soft, and not very difficult\r\nto be broken. The stones however are unequal in thickness, and\r\ntherefore by putting them together they cannot be kept in such straight\r\nlines as bricks. It sometimes likewise happens that pieces break off\r\nwhen they are cut, and leave holes on the outside of the wall. But in\r\norder to fill up these holes, the little pieces of stone which cannot\r\nbe made use of are pounded, mixed with mortar, and put into the holes;\r\nthe places thus filled up, are afterwards smoothed, and when they are\r\ndry, they are hardly distinguishable from the rest at some distance. At\r\nlast they draw on the outside of the wall, strokes of mortar, which\r\ncross each other perpendicularly, so that it looks as if the wall\r\nconsisted wholly of equal, square stones, and as if the white strokes\r\nwere the places where they were joined with mortar. The inside of the\r\nwall is made smooth, covered with mortar and whitewashed. It has not\r\nbeen observed that this kind of stone attracts the moisture in a rainy\r\nor wet season. In Philadelphia and its environs, you find several\r\nhouses built of this kind of stone.\r\n\r\nThe houses here are commonly built in the English manner.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Cock’s negroes showed me the skin of a badger (Ursus Meles)\r\nwhich he had killed a few days ago, and which convinced me that the\r\nAmerican badger is the same with the Swedish one. It was here called\r\nGround Hog.\r\n\r\nTowards night I returned to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOctober the 12th. In the morning we went to the river Skulkill, partly\r\nto gather seeds, partly to collect plants for the herbal, and to make\r\nall sorts of observations. The Skulkill is a narrow river, which falls\r\ninto the Delaware, about four miles from Philadelphia to the south; but\r\nnarrow as it is, it rises on the west side of those high mountains,\r\ncommonly called the blue mountains, and runs two hundred English miles,\r\nand perhaps more. It is a great disadvantage to this country, that\r\nthere are several cataracts in this river as low as Philadelphia, for\r\nwhich reason there can be no navigation on it. To day I made some\r\ndescriptions and remarks on such plants as the cattle liked, or such as\r\nthey never touched.\r\n\r\nI observed several little subterraneous walks in the fields, running\r\nunder ground in various directions, the opening of which was big enough\r\nfor a mole: the earth, which formed as it were a vault above it, and\r\nlay elevated like a little bank, was near two inches high, full as\r\nbroad as a man’s hand, and about two inches thick. In uncultivated\r\nfields I frequently saw these subterraneous walks, which discovered\r\nthemselves by the ground thrown up above them, which when trod upon\r\ngave way, and made it inconvenient to walk in the field.\r\n\r\nThese walks are inhabited by a kind of mole, [33] which I intend to\r\ndescribe more accurately in another work. Their food is commonly roots:\r\nI have observed the following qualities in one which was caught. It had\r\ngreater stiffness and strength in its legs, than I ever observed in\r\nother animals in proportion to their size. Whenever it intended to dig,\r\nit held its legs obliquely, like oars, I laid my handkerchief before\r\nit, and it began to stir in it with the snout, and taking away the\r\nhandkerchief to see what it had done to it, I found that in the space\r\nof a minute it had made it full of holes, and it looked as if it had\r\nbeen pierced very much by an awl. I was obliged to put some books on\r\nthe cover of the box in which I kept this animal, or else it was flung\r\noff immediately. It was very irascible, and would bite great holes into\r\nany thing that was put in its way; I held a steel pen-case to it, it at\r\nfirst bit at it with great violence, but having felt its hardness, it\r\nwould not venture again to bite at any thing. These moles do not make\r\nsuch hills as the European ones, but only such walks as I have already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nOctober the 13th. There is a plant here, from the berries of which they\r\nmake a kind of wax or tallow, and for that reason the Swedes call it\r\nthe Tallow shrub. The English call the same tree the Candleberry-tree,\r\nor Bayberry-bush; and Dr. Linnæus gives it the name of Myrica cerifera.\r\nIt grows abundantly on a wet soil, and it seems to thrive particularly\r\nwell in the neighbourhood of the sea, nor have I ever found it high up\r\nin the country far from the sea. The berries grow abundantly on the\r\nfemale shrub, and look as if flower had been strewed upon them. They\r\nare gathered late in autumn, being ripe about that time, and are then\r\nthrown into a kettle or pot full of boiling water; by this means their\r\nfat melts out, floats at the top of the water and may be skimmed off\r\ninto a vessel; with the skimming they go on till there is no tallow\r\nleft. The tallow as soon as it is congealed, looks like common tallow\r\nor wax, but has a dirty green colour; it is for that reason melted over\r\nagain, and refined, by which means it acquires a fine and pretty\r\ntransparent green colour: this tallow is dearer than common tallow, but\r\ncheaper than wax. In Philadelphia they pay a shilling Pensylvania\r\ncurrency, for a pound of this tallow; but a pound of common tallow only\r\ncame to half that money, and wax costs as much again. From this tallow\r\nthey make candles in many parts of this province, but they usually mix\r\nsome common tallow with it. Candles of this kind, do not easily bend,\r\nnor melt in summer as common candles do; they burn better and slower,\r\nnor do they cause any smoak, but rather yield an agreeable smell, when\r\nthey are extinguished. An old Swede of ninety-one years of age told me,\r\nthat this sort of candles had formerly been much in use with his\r\ncountry men. At present they do not make so many candles of this kind,\r\nif they can get the tallow of animals; it being too troublesome to\r\ngather the berries. However these candles are made use of by poor\r\npeople, who live in the neighbourhood of a place where the bushes grow,\r\nand have not cattle enough to kill, in order to supply them with a\r\nsufficient quantity of tallow. From the wax of the candleberry tree\r\nthey likewise make a soap here, which has an agreeable scent, and is\r\nthe best for shaving. This wax is likewise used by doctors, and\r\nsurgeons, who reckon it exceeding good for plasters upon wounds. A\r\nmerchant of this town once sent a quantity of these candles to those\r\nAmerican provinces which had Roman Catholic inhabitants, thinking he\r\nwould be well paid, since wax candles are made use of in the Roman\r\nCatholick churches; but the clergy would not take them. An old Swede\r\nmentioned that the root of the candleberry tree was formerly made use\r\nof by the Indians, as a remedy against the tooth ach, and that he\r\nhimself having had the tooth ach very violently, had cut the root in\r\npieces and applied it round his tooth; and that the pain had been\r\nlessened by it. Another Swede assured me that he had been cured of the\r\ntooth ach, by applying the peel of the root to it. In Carolina, they\r\nnot only make candles out of the wax of the berries, but likewise\r\nsealing-wax.\r\n\r\nOctober the 14th. Penny Royal is a plant which has a peculiar strong\r\nscent, and grows abundantly on dry places in the country. Botanists\r\ncall it Cunila pulegioides. It is reckoned very wholesome to drink as a\r\ntea when a person has got cold, as it promotes perspiration. I was\r\nlikewise told, that on feeling a pain in any limb, this plant, if\r\napplied to it, would give immediate relief.\r\n\r\nThe goods which are shipped to London from New England are the\r\nfollowing: all sorts of fish caught near Newfoundland and elsewhere;\r\ntrain-oil of several sorts; whale-bone; tar, pitch, masts; new ships,\r\nof which a great number is annually built; a few hides, and sometimes\r\nsome sorts of wood. The English islands in America, as Jamaica and\r\nBarbadoes, get from New England, fish, flesh, butter, cheese, tallow,\r\nhorses, cattle; all sorts of lumber, such as pails, buckets, and\r\nhogsheads; and have returns made in rum, sugar, melasses, and other\r\nproduces of the country, or in cash, the greatest part of all which\r\nthey send to London (the money especially) in payment of the goods\r\nreceived from thence, and yet all this is inefficient to pay off the\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nOctober the 15th. The Alders grew here in considerable abundance on wet\r\nand low places, and even sometimes on pretty high ones, but never\r\nreached the height of the European alders, and commonly stood like a\r\nbush about a fathom or two high. Mr. Bartram, and other gentlemen who\r\nhad frequently travelled in these provinces, told me that the more you\r\ngo to the south, the less are the alders, but that they are higher and\r\ntaller, the more you advance to the north. I found afterwards myself,\r\nthat the alders in some places of Canada, are little inferior to the\r\nSwedish ones. Their bark is employed here in dying red and brown. A\r\nSwedish inhabitant of America, told me that he had cut his leg to the\r\nvery bone, and that some coagulated blood had already been settled\r\nwithin. That he had been advised to boil the alder bark, and to wash\r\nthe wound often with the water: that he followed this advice, and had\r\nsoon got his leg healed, though it had been very dangerous at first.\r\n\r\nThe Phytolacca decandra was called Poke by the English. The Swedes had\r\nno particular name for it, but made use of the English, with some\r\nlittle variation into Paok. When the juice of its berries is put upon\r\npaper or the like, it strikes it with a high purple colour, which is as\r\nfine as any in the world, and it is pity that no method is as yet found\r\nout, of making this colour last on woollen and linen cloth, for it\r\nfades very soon. Mr. Bartram mentioned, that having hit his foot\r\nagainst a stone, he had got a violent pain in it; he then bethought\r\nhimself to put a leaf of the Phytolacca on his foot, by which he lost\r\nthe pain in a short time, and got his foot well soon after. The berries\r\nare eaten by the birds about this time. The English and several Swedes\r\nmake use of the leaves in spring, when they are just come out, and are\r\nyet tender and soft, and eat them partly as green cale, and partly in\r\nthe manner we eat spinnage. Sometimes they likewise prepare them in the\r\nfirst of these ways, when the stalks are already grown a little longer,\r\nbreaking off none but the upper sprouts which are yet tender, and not\r\nwoody; but in this latter case, great care is to be taken, for if you\r\neat the plant when it is already grown up, and its leaves are no longer\r\nsoft, you may expect death as a consequence which seldom fails to\r\nfollow, for the plant has then got a power of purging the body to\r\nexcess. I have known people, who, by eating great full grown leaves of\r\nthis plant, have got such a strong dysentery, that they were near dying\r\nwith it: its berries however are eaten in autumn by children, without\r\nany ill consequence.\r\n\r\nWoollen and linen cloth is dyed yellow with the bark of hiccory. This\r\nlikewise is done with the bark of the black oak, or Linnæus’s Quercus\r\nnigra, and that variety of it which Catesby in his Natural History of\r\nCarolina, vol. i. tab. 19. calls Quercus marilandica. The flowers and\r\nleaves of the Impatiens Noli tangere or balsamine, likewise dyed all\r\nwoollen stuffs with a fine yellow colour.\r\n\r\nThe Collinsonia canadensis was frequently found in little woods and\r\nbushes, in a good rich soil. Mr. Bartram who knew the country perfectly\r\nwell, was sure that Pensylvania, and all the parts of America in the\r\nsame climate, were the true and original places where this plant grows.\r\nFor further to the south, neither he nor Messrs. Clayton and Mitchel\r\never found it, though the latter gentlemen have made accurate\r\nobservations in Virginia and part of Maryland. And from his own\r\nexperience he knew, that it did not grow in the northerly parts. I have\r\nnever found it more than fifteen min. north of forty-three deg. The\r\ntime of the year when it comes up in Pensylvania, is so late, that its\r\nseed has but just time sufficient to ripen in, and it therefore seems\r\nunlikely, that it can succeed further north, Mr. Bartram was the first\r\nwho discovered it, and sent it over into Europe. Mr. Jussieu during his\r\nstay at London, and Dr. Linnæus afterwards, called it Collinsonia, from\r\nthe celebrated Mr. Peter Collinson, a merchant in London, and fellow of\r\nthe English and Swedish Royal Societies. He well deserved the honour of\r\nhaving a plant called after his name, for there are few people that\r\nhave promoted natural history and all useful sciences with a zeal like\r\nhis; or that have done as much as he towards collecting, cultivating,\r\nand making known all sorts of plants. The Collinsonia has a peculiar\r\nscent, which is agreeable, but very strong. It always gave me a pretty\r\nviolent head-ach whenever I passed by a place where it stood in plenty,\r\nand especially when it was in flower. Mr. Bartram was acquainted with a\r\nbetter quality of this plant, which was that of being an excellent\r\nremedy against all sorts of pain in the limbs, and against a cold, when\r\nthe parts affected are rubbed with it. And Mr. Conrad Weisser,\r\ninterpreter of the language of the Indians in Pensylvania, had told him\r\nof a more wonderful cure with this plant. He was once among a company\r\nof Indians, one of which had been stung by a rattle snake, the savages\r\ngave him over, but he boiled the collinsonia, and made the poor wretch\r\ndrink the water, from which he happily recovered. Somewhat more to the\r\nnorth and in New York they call this plant Horseweed, because the\r\nhorses eat it in spring, before any other plant comes up.\r\n\r\nOctober the 16th. I asked Mr. Franklin and other gentlemen who were\r\nwell acquainted with this country, whether they had met with any signs,\r\nfrom whence they could have concluded that any place which was now a\r\npart of the continent, had formerly been covered with water? and I got\r\nthe following account in answer.\r\n\r\n1. On travelling from hence to the south, you meet with a place where\r\nthe highroad is very low in the ground between two mountains. On both\r\nsides you see nothing but oyster shells and muscle shells in immense\r\nquantities above each other; however the place is many miles off the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n2. Whenever they dig wells, or build houses in town, they find the\r\nearth lying in several strata above each other. At a depth of fourteen\r\nfeet or more, they find globular stones, which are as smooth on the\r\noutside as those which lie on the sea-shore, and are made round and\r\nsmooth by the rolling of the waves. And after having dug through the\r\nsand, and reached a depth of eighteen feet or more, they discover in\r\nsome places a slime like that which the sea throws up on the shore, and\r\nwhich commonly lies at its bottom and in rivers; this slime is quite\r\nfull of trees, leaves, branches, reed, charcoal, &c.\r\n\r\n3. It has sometimes happened that new houses have sunk on one side in a\r\nshort time, and have obliged the people to pull them down again. On\r\ndigging deeper, for a very hard ground to build upon, they have found a\r\nquantity of the above slime, wood, roots, &c.\r\n\r\nAre not these reasons sufficient to make one suppose that those places\r\nin Philadelphia which are at present fourteen feet and more under\r\nground, formerly were the bottom of the sea, and that by several\r\naccidents, sand, earth, and other things were carried upon it? or, that\r\nthe Delaware formerly was broader than it is at present? or, that it\r\nhas changed its course? This last still often happens at present; the\r\nriver breaking off the bank on one side, and forming one on the other.\r\nBoth the Swedes and English often shewed me such places.\r\n\r\nOctober the 18th. At present I did not find above ten different kinds\r\nof plants in blossom: they were, a Gentiana, two species of Aster, the\r\ncommon Golden Rod, or Solidago Virga aurea, a species of Hieracium, the\r\nyellow wood Sorrel, or Oxalis corniculata, the Fox Gloves, or Digitalis\r\npurpurea, the Hamamelis Virginiana, or Witch Hazel, our common\r\nMillefoil, or Achillæa Millefolium, and our Dandelion, or Leontodon\r\nTaraxacum. All other plants had for this year laid aside their gay\r\ncolours. Several trees, especially those which were to flower early in\r\nspring, had already formed such large buds, that on opening them all\r\nthe parts of fructification, such as Calyx, Corolla, Stamina and\r\nPistillum were plainly distinguishable. It was therefore easy to\r\ndetermine the genus to which such trees belonged. Such were the red\r\nmaple, or Acer rubrum, and the Laurus æstivalis, a species of bay. Thus\r\nnature prepared to bring forth flowers, with the first mild weather in\r\nthe next year. The buds were at present quite hard, and all their parts\r\npressed close together, that the cold might by all means be excluded.\r\n\r\nThe black Walnut trees had for the greatest part dropt their leaves,\r\nand many of them were entirely without them. The walnuts themselves\r\nwere already fallen off. The green peel which enclosed them, if\r\nfrequently handled, would yield a black colour, which could not be got\r\noff the fingers in two or three weeks time, though the hands were\r\nwashed ever so much.\r\n\r\nThe Cornus florida was called Dogwood by the English, and grew\r\nabundantly in the woods. It looks beautiful when it is adorned with its\r\nnumerous great white flowers in spring. The wood is very hard, and is\r\ntherefore made use of for weaver’s spools, joiner’s planes, wedges, &c.\r\nWhen the cattle fall down in spring for want of strength, the people\r\ntie a branch of this tree on their neck, thinking it will help them.\r\n\r\nOctober the 19th. The Tulip tree grows every where in the woods of this\r\ncountry. The botanists call it Liriodendron tulipifera, because its\r\nflowers both in respect to their size, and in respect to their exterior\r\nform, and even in some measure with regard to their colour, resemble\r\ntulips. The Swedes called it Canoe tree, for both the Indians and the\r\nEuropeans often make their canoes of the stem of this tree. The\r\nEnglishmen in Pensylvania give it the name of Poplar. It is reckoned a\r\ntree which grows to the greatest height and thickness of any in North\r\nAmerica, and which vies in that point with our greatest European trees.\r\nThe white oak and the fir in North America, however are little inferior\r\nto it. It cannot therefore but be very agreeable to see in spring, at\r\nthe end of May (when it is in blossom) one of the greatest trees\r\ncovered for a fortnight together with flowers, which with regard to\r\ntheir shape, size, and partly colour are like tulips, the leaves have\r\nlikewise something peculiar, the English therefore in some places call\r\nthe tree the old woman’s smock, because their imagination finds\r\nsomething like it below the leaves.\r\n\r\nIts wood is here made use of for canoes, boards, planks, bowls, dishes,\r\nspoons, door posts, and all sorts of joiners work. I have seen a barn\r\nof a considerable size whose walls, and roof were made of a single tree\r\nof this kind, split into boards. Some joiners reckoned this wood better\r\nthan oak, because this latter frequently is warped, which the other\r\nnever does, but works very easy; others again valued it very little. It\r\nis certain, that it contracts so much in hot weather, as to occasion\r\ngreat cracks in the boards, and in wet weather it swells so as to be\r\nnear bursting, and the people hardly know of a wood in these parts\r\nwhich varies so much in contracting and expanding itself. The joiners\r\nhowever make much use of it in their work, they say there are two\r\nspecies of it; but they are merely two varieties, one of which in time\r\nturns yellow within, the other is white, the former is said to have a\r\nlooser texture. The bark (like Russia glass) is divisible into very\r\nthin leaves, which are very tough like bast, though I have never seen\r\nit employed as such. The leaves when crushed and applied to the\r\nforehead are said to be a remedy against the head ach. When horses are\r\nplagued with worms, the bark is pounded, and given them quite dry. Many\r\npeople believe its roots to be as efficacious against the fever as the\r\njesuits bark. The trees grow in all sorts of dry soil, both on high and\r\nlow grounds, but too wet a soil will not agree with them.\r\n\r\nOctober the 20th. The Beaver tree is to be met with in several parts of\r\nPensylvania and New Jersey, in a poor swampy soil, or on wet meadows.\r\nDr. Linnæus calls it Magnolia glauca; both the Swedes and English call\r\nit Beaver tree, because the root of this tree is the dainty of beavers,\r\nwhich are caught by its means, however the Swedes sometimes gave it a\r\ndifferent name, and the English as improperly called it Swamp\r\nSassafras, and White Laurel. The trees of this kind dropt their leaves\r\nearly in autumn, though some of the young trees kept them all the\r\nwinter. I have seldom found the beaver tree to the north of\r\nPensylvania, where it begins to flower about the end of May. The scent\r\nof its blossoms is excellent, for by it you can discover within three\r\nquarters of an English mile, whether these little trees stand in the\r\nneighbourhood, provided the wind be not against it. For the whole air\r\nis filled with this sweet and pleasant scent. It is beyond description\r\nagreeable to travel in the woods about that time, especially towards\r\nnight. They retain their flowers for three weeks and even longer,\r\naccording to the quality of the soil on which the trees stand; and\r\nduring the whole time of their being in blossom, they spread their\r\nodoriferous exhalations. The berries likewise look very fine when they\r\nare ripe, for they have a rich red colour, and hang in bunches on\r\nslender stalks. The cough, and other pectoral diseases are cured by\r\nputting the berries into rum or brandy, of which a draught every\r\nmorning may be taken; the virtues of this remedy were universally\r\nextolled, and even praised for their salutary effects in consumptions.\r\nThe bark being put into brandy, or boiled in any other liquor, is said\r\nnot only to ease pectoral diseases, but likewise to be of some service\r\nagainst all internal pains and heat; and it was thought that a\r\ndecoction of it could stop the dysentery. Persons who had caught cold,\r\nboiled the branches of the beaver tree in water, and drank it to their\r\ngreat relief. A Swede, called Lars Lack, gave the following account of\r\na cure effected by this tree: One of his relations, an old man, had an\r\nopen sore in his leg, which would not heal up again, though he had had\r\nmuch advice and used many remedies. An Indian at last effected the cure\r\nin the following manner. He burnt some of this wood to charcoal, which\r\nhe reduced to powder, mixed with the fresh fat of pork, and rubbed the\r\nopen places several times. This dried up the holes, which before were\r\ncontinually open, and the legs of the old man were quite sound to his\r\ndeath. The wood is likewise made use of for joiner’s planes.\r\n\r\nOctober the 22d. Upon trial it has been found that the following\r\nanimals and birds, which are wild in the woods of North America, can be\r\nmade nearly as tractable as domestic animals.\r\n\r\nThe wild Cows and Oxen, of which several people of distinction have got\r\nyoung calves from these wild cows, which are to be met with in\r\nCarolina, and other provinces to the south of Pensylvania, and brought\r\nthem up among the tame cattle; when grown up, they were perfectly tame,\r\nbut at the same time very unruly, so that there was no enclosure strong\r\nenough to resist them, if they had a mind to break through it; for as\r\nthey possess a great strength in their neck, it was easy for them to\r\noverthrow the pales with their horns, and to get into the corn-fields;\r\nand as soon as they had made a road, all the tame cattle followed them;\r\nthey likewise copulated with the latter, and by that means generated as\r\nit were a new breed. This American species of oxen is Linnæus’s Bos\r\nBison, β.\r\n\r\nAmerican Deer, can likewise be tamed; and I have seen them tame myself\r\nin different places. A farmer in New Jersey had one in his possession,\r\nwhich he had caught when it was very young; and at present it was so\r\ntame, that in the day time it run into the wood for its food, and\r\ntowards night it returned home, and frequently brought a wild deer out\r\nof the wood, giving its master an opportunity to shoot it. Several\r\npeople have therefore tamed young deer, and make use of them for\r\nhunting wild deer, or for decoying them home, especially in the time of\r\ntheir rutting.\r\n\r\nBeavers have been so tamed that they have gone on fishing, and brought\r\nhome what they had caught to their masters. This often is the case with\r\nOtters, of which I have seen some, which were as tame as dogs, and\r\nfollowed their masters wherever they went; if he went out in a boat,\r\nthe otter went with him, jumped into the water, and after a while came\r\nup with a fish. The Opossum, can likewise be tamed, so as to follow\r\npeople like a dog.\r\n\r\nThe Raccoon which we (Swedes) call Siupp, can in time be made so tame\r\nas to run about the streets like a domestic animal; but it is\r\nimpossible to make it leave off its habit of stealing. In the dark it\r\ncreeps to the poultry, and kills in one night a whole flock. Sugar and\r\nother sweet things must be carefully hidden from it, for if the chests\r\nand boxes are not always locked up, it gets into them, eats the sugar,\r\nand licks up the treacle with its paws: the ladies therefore have every\r\nday some complaint against it, and for this reason many people rather\r\nforbear the diversion which this ape-like animal affords.\r\n\r\nThe grey and flying Squirrels are so tamed by the boys, that they sit\r\non their shoulders, and follow them every where.\r\n\r\nThe Turkey Cocks and Hens run about in the woods of this country, and\r\ndiffer in nothing from our tame ones, except in their superior size,\r\nand redder, though more palatable flesh. When their eggs are found in\r\nthe wood, and put under tame Turkey hens, the young ones become tame;\r\nhowever when they grow up, it sometimes happens that they fly away;\r\ntheir wings are therefore commonly clipped, especially when young. But\r\nthe tamed turkeys are commonly much more irascible, than those which\r\nare naturally tame. The Indians likewise employ themselves in taming\r\nthem and keeping them near their huts.\r\n\r\nWild Geese have likewise been tamed in the following manner. When the\r\nwild geese first come hither in spring, and stop a little while (for\r\nthey do not breed in Pensylvania) the people try to shoot them in the\r\nwing, which however is generally mere chance. They then row to the\r\nplace where the wild goose fell, catch it, and keep it for some time at\r\nhome, by this means many of them have been made so tame, that when they\r\nwere let out in the morning, they returned in the evening, but to be\r\nmore sure of them, their wings are commonly clipped. I have seen wild\r\ngeese of this kind, which the owner assured me, that he had kept for\r\nmore than twelve years; but though he kept eight of them, yet he never\r\nhad the pleasure to see them copulate with the tame ones, or lay eggs.\r\n\r\nPartridges, which are here in abundance, may likewise be so far tamed,\r\nas to run about all day with the poultry, and to come along with them\r\nto be fed when they are called. In the same manner I have seen wild\r\nPigeons, which were made so tame as to fly out and return again. In\r\nsome winters there are immense quantities of wild pigeons in\r\nPensylvania.\r\n\r\nOctober the 24th. Of all the rare birds of North America, the Humming\r\nbird is the most admirable, or at least most worthy of peculiar\r\nattention. Several reasons induce me to believe that few parts of the\r\nworld can produce its equal. Dr. Linnæus calls it Trochilus Colubris.\r\nThe Swedes and some Englishmen call it the King’s bird, but the name of\r\nHumming bird is more common. Catesby in his Natural History of\r\nCarolina, Vol. i. page 65, tab. 65. has drawn it, in its natural size,\r\nwith its proper colours, and added a description of it. [34] In size it\r\nis not much bigger than a large humble bee, and is therefore the least\r\nof all birds, [35] or it is much if there is a lesser species in the\r\nworld. Its plumage is most beautifully coloured, most of its feathers\r\nbeing green, some grey, and others forming a shining red ring round its\r\nneck; the tail glows with fine feathers, changing from green into a\r\nbrass colour. These birds come here in spring about the time when it\r\nbegins to grow very warm, and make their nests in summer, but towards\r\nautumn they retreat again into the more southern countries of America.\r\nThey subsist barely upon the nectar, or sweet juice of flowers\r\ncontained in that part, which botanists call the nectarium, and which\r\nthey suck up with their long bills. Of all the flowers, they like those\r\nmost, which have a long tube, and I have observed that they have\r\nfluttered chiefly about the Impatiens Noli tangere, and the Monarda\r\nwith crimson flowers. An inhabitant of the country is sure to have a\r\nnumber of these beautiful and agreeable little birds before his window\r\nall the summer long, if he takes care to plant a bed with all sorts of\r\nfine flowers under them. It is indeed a diverting spectacle to see\r\nthese little active creatures flying about the flowers like bees, and\r\nsucking their juices with their long and narrow bills. The flowers of\r\nthe above-mentioned Monarda grow verticillated, that is, at different\r\ndistances they surround the stalk, as the flowers of our mint (Mentha)\r\nbastard hemp (Galeopsis) mother-wort (Leonurus) and dead nettle\r\n(Lamium). It is therefore diverting to see them putting their bills\r\ninto every flower in the circle. As soon as they have sucked the juice\r\nof one flower, they flutter to the next. One that has not seen them\r\nwould hardly believe in how short a space of time they have had their\r\ntongues in all the flowers of a plant, which when large and with a long\r\ntube, the little bird by putting its head into them, looks as if it\r\ncrept with half its body into them.\r\n\r\nDuring their sucking the juice out of the flowers they never settle on\r\nit, but flutter continually like bees, bend their feet backwards, and\r\nmove their wings so quick, that they are hardly visible. During this\r\nfluttering they make a humming like bees, or like that which is\r\noccasioned by the turning of a little wheel. After they have thus,\r\nwithout resting, fluttered for a while, they fly to a neighbouring tree\r\nor post, and resume their vigour again. They then return to their\r\nhumming and sucking. They are not very shy, and I in company with\r\nseveral other people, have not been full two yards from the place where\r\nthey fluttered about and sucked the flowers; and though we spoke and\r\nmoved, yet they were no ways disturbed; but on going towards them, they\r\nwould fly off with the swiftness of an arrow. When several of them were\r\non the same bed, there was always a violent combat between them, in\r\nmeeting each other at the same flower (for envy was likewise\r\npredominant amongst these little creatures) and they attacked with such\r\nimpetuosity, that it would seem as if the strongest would pierce its\r\nantagonist through and through, with its long bill. During the fight,\r\nthey seem to stand in the air, keeping themselves up, by the incredibly\r\nswift motion of their wings. When the windows towards the garden are\r\nopen, they pursue each other into the rooms, fight a little, and\r\nflutter away again. Sometimes they come to a flower which is withering,\r\nand has no more juice in it; they then in a fit of anger pluck it off,\r\nand throw it on the ground, that it may not mislead them for the\r\nfuture. If a garden contains a great number of these little birds, they\r\nare seen to pluck off the flowers in such quantities, that the ground\r\nis quite covered with them, and it seems as if this proceeded from a\r\nmotion of envy.\r\n\r\nCommonly you hear no other sound than their humming, but when they fly\r\nagainst each other in the air, they make a chirping noise like a\r\nsparrow or chicken. I have sometimes walked with several other people\r\nin small gardens, and these birds have on all sides fluttered about us,\r\nwithout appearing very shy. They are so small that one would easily\r\nmistake them for great humming-bees or butterflies, and their flight\r\nresembles that of the former, and is incredibly swift. They have never\r\nbeen observed to feed on insects or fruit; the nectar of flowers, seems\r\ntherefore to be their only food. Several people have caught some\r\nhumming birds on account of their singular beauty, and have put them\r\ninto cages, where they died for want of a proper food. However Mr.\r\nBartram has kept a couple of them for several weeks together, by\r\nfeeding them with water in which sugar had been dissolved, and I am of\r\nopinion that it would not be difficult to keep them all winter in a\r\nhot-house.\r\n\r\nThe humming bird always builds its nest in the middle of a branch of a\r\ntree, and it is so small, that it cannot be seen from the ground, but\r\nhe who intends to see it must get up to the branch. For this reason it\r\nis looked upon as a great rarity if a nest is accidentally found,\r\nespecially as the trees in summer have so thick a foliage. The nest is\r\nlikewise the least of all; that which is in my possession is quite\r\nround, and consists in the inside of a brownish and quite soft down,\r\nwhich seems to have been collected from the leaves of the great mullein\r\nor Verbascum Thapsus, which are often found covered with a soft wool of\r\nthis colour, and the plant is plentiful here. The outside of the nest\r\nhas a coating of green moss, such as is common on old pales or\r\nenclosures and on trees; the inner diameter of the nest is hardly a\r\ngeometrical inch at the top, and its depth half an inch. It is however\r\nknown that the humming birds make their nests likewise of flax, hemp,\r\nmoss, hair and other such soft materials; they are said to lay two\r\neggs, each of the size of a pea.\r\n\r\nOctober the 25th. I employed this day and the next in packing up all\r\nthe seeds gathered this autumn, for I had an opportunity of sending\r\nthem to England by the ships which sailed about this time. From England\r\nthey were forwarded to Sweden.\r\n\r\nOctober the 27th. In the morning I set out on a little journey to New\r\nYork, in company with Mr. Peter Cock, with a view to see the country,\r\nand to enquire into the safest road, which I could take in going to\r\nCanada, through the desart or uninhabited country between it and the\r\nEnglish provinces.\r\n\r\nThat part where we travelled at present was pretty well inhabited on\r\nboth sides of the road, by Englishmen, Germans and other Europeans.\r\nPlains and hills of different dimensions were seen alternately,\r\nmountains and stones, I never saw, excepting a few pebbles. Near almost\r\nevery farm was a great orchard with peach and apple trees, some of\r\nwhich were yet loaded with fruit.\r\n\r\nThe enclosures were in some parts low enough, for the cattle to leap\r\nover them with ease; to prevent this the hogs had a triangular wooden\r\nyoke: this custom was as I have already observed, common over all the\r\nEnglish plantations. To the horses neck was fastened a piece of wood,\r\nwhich at the lower end had a tooth or hook, fastening in the enclosure,\r\nand stopping the horse, just when it lifted its fore feet to leap over;\r\nbut I know not whether this be a good invention with regard to horses.\r\nThey were likewise kept in bounds by a piece of wood, one end of which\r\nwas fastened to one of the fore feet, and the other to one of the hind\r\nfeet, and it forced them to walk pretty slowly, as at the same time it\r\nmade it impossible for them to leap over the enclosures. To me it\r\nappeared that the horses were subject to all sorts of dangerous\r\naccidents from this piece of wood.\r\n\r\nNear New Frankfurt we rode over a little stone bridge, and somewhat\r\nfurther, eight or nine English miles from Philadelphia we passed over\r\nanother, which was likewise of stone. There are not yet any milestones\r\nput up in the country, and the inhabitants only compute the distances\r\nby guess. We were afterwards brought over a river in a ferry, where we\r\npaid threepence a person, for ourselves and our horses.\r\n\r\nAt one of the places where we stopt to have our horses fed, the people\r\nhad a Mocking-bird in a cage; and it is here reckoned the best singing\r\nbird, though its plumage be very simple, and not showy at all. At this\r\ntime of the year it does not sing. Linnæus calls it Turdus polyglottos,\r\nand Catesby in his Natural History of Carolina, Vol. 1. p. 27. tab. 27,\r\nhas likewise described and drawn this bird. The people said that it\r\nbuilt its nests in the bushes and trees, but is so shy, that if any\r\nbody come and look at its eggs, it leaves the nest, never to come to it\r\nagain. Its young ones require great care in being bred up. If they are\r\ntaken from their mother and put into a cage, she feeds them for three\r\nor four days; but seeing no hopes of setting them at liberty, she flies\r\naway. It then often happens, that the young ones die soon after,\r\ndoubtless because they cannot accustom themselves to eat what the\r\npeople give them. But it is generally imagined, that the last time the\r\nmother feeds them, she finds means to poison them, in order, the sooner\r\nto deliver them from slavery and wretchedness. These birds stay all\r\nsummer in the colonies, but retire in autumn to the south, and stay\r\naway all winter. They have got the name of Mocking-birds, on account of\r\ntheir skill in imitating the note of almost every bird they hear. The\r\nsong peculiar to them is excellent, and varied by an infinite change of\r\nnotes and melody; several people are therefore of opinion, that they\r\nare the best singing birds in the world. So much is certain, that few\r\nbirds come up to them; this is what makes them precious: the Swedes\r\ncall it by the same name as the English.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we came to New Bristol, a small town in Pensylvania, on the\r\nbanks of the Delaware, about fifteen English miles from Philadelphia.\r\nMost of the houses are built of stone, and stand asunder. The\r\ninhabitants carry on a small trade, though most of them get their goods\r\nfrom Philadelphia. On the other side of the river, almost directly\r\nopposite to New Bristol, lies the town of Burlington, in which the\r\ngovernor of New Jersey resides.\r\n\r\nWe had now country seats on both sides of the roads. Now we came into a\r\nlane enclosed with pales on both sides, including pretty great\r\ncorn-fields. Next followed a wood, and we perceived for the space of\r\nfour English miles nothing but woods, and a very poor soil, on which\r\nthe Lupinus perennis grew plentifully and succeeded well. I was\r\noverjoyed to see a plant come on so well in these poor dry places, and\r\neven began to meditate, how to improve this discovery in a soil like\r\nthat which it inhabited. But I afterwards had the mortification to find\r\nthat the horses and cows eat almost all the other plants, but left the\r\nlupine, which was however very green, looked very fresh, and was\r\nextremely soft to the touch. Perhaps means may be found out of making\r\nthis plant palatable to the cattle. In the evening we arrived at\r\nTrenton, after having previously passed the Delaware in a ferry.\r\n\r\nOctober the 28th. Trenton is a long narrow town, situate at some\r\ndistance from the river Delaware, on a sandy plain; it belongs to New\r\nJersey, and they reckon it thirty miles from Philadelphia. It has two\r\nsmall churches, one for the people belonging to the church of England,\r\nthe other for the presbyterians. The houses are partly built of stone,\r\nthough most of them are made of wood or planks, commonly two stories\r\nhigh, together with a cellar below the building, and a kitchen under\r\nground, close to the cellar. The houses stand at a moderate distance\r\nfrom one another. They are commonly built so, that the street passes\r\nalong one side of the houses, while gardens of different dimensions\r\nbound the other side; in each garden is a draw-well; the place is\r\nreckoned very healthy. Our landlord told us, that twenty-two years ago,\r\nwhen he first settled here, there was hardly more than one house; but\r\nfrom that time Trenton has encreased so much, that there are at present\r\nnear a hundred houses. The houses were within divided into several\r\nrooms by their partitions of boards. The inhabitants of the place\r\ncarried on a small trade with the goods which they got from\r\nPhiladelphia, but their chief gain consisted in the arrival of the\r\nnumerous travellers between that city and New York; for they are\r\ncommonly brought by the Trenton Yachts from Philadelphia to Trenton, or\r\nfrom thence to Philadelphia. But from Trenton further to New Brunswick,\r\nthe travellers go in the waggons which set out every day for that\r\nplace. Several of the inhabitants however likewise subsist on the\r\ncarriage for all sorts of goods, which are every day sent in great\r\nquantities, either from Philadelphia to New York, or from thence to the\r\nformer place; for between Philadelphia and Trenton all goods go by\r\nwater, but between Trenton and New Brunswick they are all carried by\r\nland, and both these conveniences belong to people of this town.\r\n\r\nFor the yachts which go between this place and the capital of\r\nPensylvania, they usually pay a shilling and six-pence of Pensylvania\r\ncurrency per person, and every one pays besides for his baggage. Every\r\npassenger must provide meat and drink for himself, or pay some settled\r\nfare: between Trenton and New Brunswick a person pays two shillings and\r\nsixpence, and the baggage is likewise paid for separately.\r\n\r\nWe continued our journey in the morning; the country through which we\r\npassed was for the greatest part level, though sometimes there were\r\nsome long hills, some parts were covered with trees, but far the\r\ngreater part of the country was without woods; on the other hand I\r\nnever saw any place in America, the towns excepted, so well peopled. An\r\nold man, who lived in this neighbourhood and accompanied us for some\r\npart of the road, however assured me, that he could well remember the\r\ntime, when between Trenton and New Brunswick there were not above three\r\nfarms, and he reckoned it was about fifty and some odd years ago.\r\nDuring the greater part of the day we had very extensive corn-fields on\r\nboth sides of the road, and commonly towards the south the country had\r\na great declivity. Near almost every farm was a spacious orchard full\r\nof peaches and apple trees, and in some of them the fruit was fallen\r\nfrom the trees in such quantities, as to cover nearly the whole\r\nsurface. Part of it they left to rot, since they could not take it all\r\nin and consume it. Wherever we passed by we were always welcome to go\r\ninto the fine orchards, and gather our hats and pockets full of the\r\nchoicest fruit, without the possessor’s so much as looking after it.\r\nCherry trees were planted near the farms, on the roads, &c.\r\n\r\nThe barns [36] had a peculiar kind of construction hereabouts, which I\r\nwill give a concise description of. The whole building was very great,\r\nso as almost to equal a small church; the roof was pretty high, covered\r\nwith wooden shingles, declining on both sides, but not steep: the walls\r\nwhich support it, were not much higher than a full grown man; but on\r\nthe other hand the breadth of the building was the more considerable:\r\nin the middle was the threshing floor, and above it, or in the loft or\r\ngarret they put the corn which was not yet threshed, the straw, or any\r\nthing else, according to the season: on one side were stables for the\r\nhorses, and on the other for the cows. And the small cattle had\r\nlikewise their particular stables or styes; on both ends of the\r\nbuildings were great gates, so that one could come in with a cart and\r\nhorses through one of them, and go out at the other: here was therefore\r\nunder one roof the threshing floor, the barn, the stables, the hay\r\nloft, the coach house, &c. This kind of buildings is chiefly made use\r\nof by the Dutch and Germans; for it is to be observed that the country\r\nbetween Trenton and New York, is inhabited by few Englishmen, but\r\ninstead of them by Germans or Dutch, [37] the latter of which\r\nespecially are numerous.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed, I find it necessary to remark one thing with regard\r\nto the Indians, or old Americans. For this account may perhaps meet\r\nwith readers, who, like many people of my acquaintance, may be of\r\nopinion that all North America, was almost wholly inhabited by savage\r\nor heathen nations, and they may be astonished, that I do not mention\r\nthem more frequently in my account. Others may perhaps imagine, that\r\nwhen I mention in my journal, that the country is much cultivated, that\r\nin several places, houses of stone or wood are built, round which are\r\ncorn-fields, gardens, and orchards, that I am speaking of the property\r\nof the Indians; to undeceive them, I here give the following\r\nexplication. The country especially all along the coasts, in the\r\nEnglish colonies, is inhabited by Europeans, who in some places are\r\nalready so numerous, that few parts of Europe are more populous. The\r\nIndians have sold the country to the Europeans, and have retired\r\nfurther up: in most parts you may travel twenty Swedish miles, or about\r\na hundred and twenty English miles, from the sea shore, before you\r\nreach the first habitations of the Indians. And it is very possible for\r\na person to have been at Philadelphia and other towns on the sea shore\r\nfor half a year together, without so much as seeing an Indian. I intend\r\nin the sequel to give a more circumstantial account of them, their\r\nreligion, manners, oeconomy, and other particulars relating to them: at\r\npresent I return to the sequel of my journal.\r\n\r\nAbout nine English miles from Trenton, the ground began to change its\r\ncolour; hitherto it consisted of a considerable quantity of hazel\r\ncoloured clay, but at present the earth was a reddish brown, so that it\r\nsometimes had a purple colour, and sometimes looked like logwood. This\r\ncolour came from a red limestone which approached very near to that\r\nwhich is on the mountain Kinnekulle in West Gothland, and makes a\r\nparticular stratum in the rock. The American red limestone therefore\r\nseems to be merely a variety of that I saw in Sweden, it lay in strata\r\nof two or three fingers thickness; but was divisible into many thinner\r\nplates or shivers, whose surface was seldom flat and smooth, but\r\ncommonly rough: the strata themselves were frequently cut off by\r\nhorizontal cracks. When these stones were exposed to the air, they by\r\ndegrees shivered and withered into pieces, and at last turned into\r\ndust. The people of this neighbourhood did not know how to make any use\r\nof it; the soil above is sometimes rich and sometimes poor: in such\r\nplaces where the people had lately dug new wells, I perceived, that\r\nmost of the rubbish which was thrown up consisted of such a species of\r\nstone. This reddish brown earth we always saw till near New Brunswick,\r\nwhere it is particularly plentiful. The banks of the river, shewed in\r\nmany places nothing but strata of Limestone, which did not run\r\nhorizontally, but dipped very much.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o’clock in the morning we came to Prince-town, which is\r\nsituated in a plain. Most of the houses are built of wood, and are not\r\ncontiguous, so that there are gardens and pastures between them. As\r\nthese parts were sooner inhabited by Europeans than Pensylvania, the\r\nwoods were likewise more cut away, and the country more cultivated, so\r\nthat one might have imagined himself to be in Europe.\r\n\r\nWe now thought of continuing our journey, but as it began to rain very\r\nheavily, and continued so during the whole day and part of the night,\r\nwe were forced to stay till next morning,\r\n\r\nOctober the 29th. This morning we proceeded on our journey. The country\r\nwas pretty well peopled; however there were yet great woods in many\r\nplaces: they all consisted of deciduous trees: and I did not perceive a\r\nsingle tree of the fir kind, till I came to New Brunswick. The ground\r\nwas level, and did not seem to be every where of the richest kind. In\r\nsome places it had hillocks, losing themselves almost imperceptibly in\r\nthe plains, which were commonly crossed by a rivulet. Almost near every\r\nfarm-house were great orchards. The houses were commonly built of\r\ntimber, and at some distance by themselves stood the ovens for baking,\r\nconsisting commonly of clay.\r\n\r\nOn a hill covered with trees, and called Rockhill, I saw several pieces\r\nof stone or rock, so big, that they would have required three men to\r\nroll them down. But besides these there were few great stories in the\r\ncountry; for most of those which we saw, could easily be lifted up by a\r\nsingle man. In another place we perceived a number of little round\r\npebbles, but we did not meet with either mountains or rocks.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we arrived at New Brunswick, a pretty little town in the\r\nprovince of New Jersey, in a valley on the west side of the river\r\nRareton; on account of its low situation, it cannot be seen (coming\r\nfrom Pensylvania) before you get to the top of the hill, which is quite\r\nclose up to it: the town extends north and south along the river. The\r\nGerman inhabitants have two churches, one of stone and the other of\r\nwood; the English church is of the latter kind, but the presbyterians\r\nwere building one of stone: the town house makes likewise a pretty good\r\nappearance. Some of the other houses are built of bricks, but most of\r\nthem are made either wholly of wood, or of bricks and wood; the wooden\r\nhouses are not made of strong timber, but merely of boards or planks,\r\nwhich are within joined by laths: such houses as consist of both wood\r\nand bricks, have only the wall towards the street of bricks, all the\r\nother sides being merely of planks. This peculiar kind of ostentation\r\nwould easily lead a traveller, who passes through the town in haste, to\r\nbelieve that most of the houses are built of bricks. The houses were\r\ncovered with shingles; before each door there was an elevation, to\r\nwhich you ascend by some steps from the street; it resembled a small\r\nbalcony, and had some benches on both sides, on which the people sat in\r\nthe evening, in order to enjoy the fresh air, and to have the pleasure\r\nof viewing those who passed by. The town has only one street\r\nlengthways, and at its northern extremity there is a street across;\r\nboth of these are of a considerable length.\r\n\r\nThe river Rareton passes hard by the town, and is deep enough for great\r\nyachts to come up; its breadth near the town is within the reach of a\r\ncommon gun shot; the tide comes up several miles beyond the town, the\r\nyachts were placed lengthways along the bridge; the river has very high\r\nand pretty steep banks on both sides, but near the town there are no\r\nsuch banks, it being situated in a low valley. One of the streets is\r\nalmost entirely inhabited by Dutchmen, who came hither from Albany, and\r\nfor that reason they call it Albany street: these Dutch people only\r\nkeep company among themselves, and seldom or never go amongst the other\r\ninhabitants, living as it were quite separate from them. New Brunswick\r\nbelongs to New Jersey; however the greatest part, or rather all its\r\ntrade is to New York, which is about forty English miles distant; to\r\nthat place they send corn, flour in great quantities, bread, several\r\nother necessaries, a great quantity of linseed, boards timber, wooden\r\nvessels, and all sorts of carpenters work. Several small yachts are\r\nevery day going backwards and forwards between these two towns. The\r\ninhabitants likewise get a considerable profit from the travellers, who\r\nevery hour pass through, on the high road.\r\n\r\nThe steep banks consist of the red limestone, which I have before\r\ndescribed. It is here plainly visible that the strata are not\r\nhorizontal, but considerably dipping, especially towards the south. The\r\nweather and the air has in a great measure dissolved the stone here: I\r\nenquired, whether it could not be made use of, but was assured, that in\r\nbuilding houses it was entirely useless; for, though it is hard and\r\npermanent under ground, yet on being dug out, and exposed for some time\r\nto the air, it first crumbles into greater, then into lesser pieces,\r\nand at last is converted into dust. An inhabitant of this town, however\r\ntried to build a house with this sort of stone, but its outsides being\r\nexposed to the air, soon began to change so much, that the owner was\r\nobliged to put boards all over the wall, to preserve it from falling to\r\npieces. The people however pretend that this stone is a very good\r\nmanure, if it is scattered upon the corn-fields in its rubbish state,\r\nfor it is said to stifle the weeds: it is therefore made use of both on\r\nthe fields and in gardens. [38]\r\n\r\nTowards the evening we continued our journey, and were ferried over the\r\nriver Rareton, together with our horses. In a very dry summer, and when\r\nthe tide has ebbed, it is by no means dangerous to ride through this\r\nriver. On the opposite shore the red juniper tree was pretty abundant.\r\nThe country through which we now passed was pretty well inhabited, but\r\nin most places full of small pebbles.\r\n\r\nWe saw Guinea Hens in many places where we passed by. They sometimes\r\nrun about the fields, at a good distance from the farm-houses.\r\n\r\nAbout eight English miles from New Brunswick, the road divided. We took\r\nthat on the left, for that on the right leads to Amboy, the chief\r\nsea-town in New Jersey. The country now made a charming appearance;\r\nsome parts being high, others forming vallies, and all of them well\r\ncultivated. From the hills you had a prospect of houses, farms,\r\ngardens, corn-fields, forests, lakes, islands, roads, and pastures.\r\n\r\nIn most of the places where we travelled this day the colour of the\r\nground was reddish. I make no doubt, but there were strata of the\r\nbefore-mentioned red limestone under it. Sometimes the ground looked\r\nvery like a cinnabar ore.\r\n\r\nWood-bridge is a small village in a plain, consisting of a few houses:\r\nwe stopped here to rest our horses a little. The houses were most of\r\nthem built of boards; the walls had a covering of shingles on the\r\noutside; these shingles were round at one end, and all of a length in\r\neach row: some of the houses had an Italian roof, but the greatest part\r\nhad roofs with pediments; most of them were covered with shingles. In\r\nmost places we met with wells and buckets to draw up the water.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-town is a small town, about twenty English miles distant from\r\nNew Brunswick: we arrived there immediately after sun setting. Its\r\nhouses are mostly scattered, but well built, and generally of boards,\r\nwith a roof of shingles, and walls covered with the same. There were\r\nlikewise some stone buildings. A little rivulet passes through the town\r\nfrom west to east; it is almost reduced to nothing when the water ebbs\r\naway, but with the full tide they can bring up small yachts. Here were\r\ntwo fine churches, each of which made a much better appearance than any\r\none in Philadelphia. That belonging to the people of the church of\r\nEngland was built of bricks, had a steeple with bells, and a balustrade\r\nround it, from which there was a prospect of the country. The meeting\r\nhouse of the presbyterians was built of wood, but had both a steeple\r\nand bells, and was, like the other houses covered with shingles. The\r\ntown house made likewise a good appearance, and had a spire with a\r\nbell. The banks of the river were red, from the reddish limestone; both\r\nin and about the town were many gardens and orchards, and it might\r\ntruly be said that Elizabeth-town was situated in a garden; the ground\r\nhereabouts being even and well cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe geese, in some of the places by which we passed this day and the\r\nnext, carried three or four little sticks, of the length of a foot\r\nabout their necks; they were fastened crossways, to prevent them from\r\ncreeping through half broken enclosures. They look extremely awkward,\r\nand it is very diverting to see them in this attire.\r\n\r\nAt night we took up our lodgings at Elizabeth-town Point, an inn about\r\ntwo English miles distant from the town, and the last house on this\r\nroad belonging to New Jersey. The man who had taken the lease of it,\r\ntogether with that of the ferry near it, told us that he paid a hundred\r\nand ten pounds of Pensylvania currency to the owner.\r\n\r\nOctober the 30th. We were ready to proceed on our journey at\r\nsun-rising. Near the inn where we had passed the night, we were to\r\ncross a river, and we were brought over, together with our horses, in a\r\nwretched half rotten ferry. This river came a considerable way out of\r\nthe country, and small vessels could easily sail up it. This was a\r\ngreat advantage to the inhabitants of the neighbouring country, giving\r\nthem an opportunity of sending their goods to New York with great ease;\r\nand they even made use of it for trading to the West Indies. The\r\ncountry was low on both sides of the river, and consisted of meadows.\r\nBut there was no other hay to be got, than such as commonly grows in\r\nswampy grounds; for as the tide comes up in this river, these low\r\nplains were sometimes overflowed when the water was high. The people\r\nhereabouts are said to be troubled in summer with immense swarms of\r\ngnats or musquetoes, which sting them and their cattle. This was\r\nascribed to the low swampy meadows, on which these insects deposite\r\ntheir eggs, which are afterwards hatched by the heat.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had got over the river, we were upon Staten Island, which\r\nis quite surrounded with salt water. This is the beginning of the\r\nprovince of New York. Most of the people settled here were Dutchmen, or\r\nsuch as came hither whilst the Dutch were yet in possession of this\r\nplace. But at present they were scattered among the English and other\r\nEuropean inhabitants, and spoke English for the greatest part. The\r\nprospect of the country here is extremely pleasing, as it is not so\r\nmuch intercepted by woods, but offers more cultivated fields to view.\r\nHills and vallies still continued, as usual, to change alternately.\r\n\r\nThe farms were near each other. Most of the houses were wooden; however\r\nsome were built of stone. Near every farm-house was an orchard with\r\napple trees: the fruit was already for the greatest part gathered.\r\nHere, and on the whole journey before, I observed a press for cyder at\r\nevery farm-house, made in different manners, by which the people had\r\nalready pressed the juice out of the apples, or were just busied with\r\nthat work. Some people made use of a wheel made of thick oak planks,\r\nwhich turned upon a wooden axis by means of a horse drawing it, much in\r\nthe same manner as the people do with woad; [39] except that here the\r\nwheel runs upon planks. Cherry trees stood along the enclosures round\r\ncorn-fields.\r\n\r\nThe corn-fields were excellently situated, and either sown with wheat\r\nor rye. They had no ditches on their sides, but (as is usual in\r\nEngland) only furrows, drawn at greater or lesser distances from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn one place we observed a water mill, so situated, that when the tide\r\nflowed, the water ran into a pond: but when it ebbed, the floodgate was\r\ndrawn up, and the mill driven by the water, flowing out of the pond.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o’clock in the morning we arrived at the place where we\r\nwere to cross the water, in order to come to the town of New York. We\r\nleft our horses here and went on board the yacht: we were to go eight\r\nEnglish miles by sea; however we landed about eleven o’clock in the\r\nmorning at New York. We saw a kind of wild ducks in immense quantities\r\nupon the water: the people called them Blue bills, and they seemed to\r\nbe the same with our Pintail ducks, or Linnæus’s Anas acuta: but they\r\nwere very shy. On the shore of the continent we saw some very fine\r\nsloping corn-fields, which at present looked quite green, the corn\r\nbeing already come up. We saw many boats in which the fishermen were\r\nbusy catching oysters: to this purpose they make use of a kind of rakes\r\nwith long iron teeth bent inwards; these they used either singly or two\r\ntied together in such a manner, that the teeth were turned towards each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOctober the 31st. About New York they find innumerable quantities of\r\nexcellent oysters, and there are few places which have oysters of such\r\nan exquisite taste, and of so great a size: they are pickled and sent\r\nto the West Indies and other places; which is done in the following\r\nmanner. As soon as the oysters are caught, their shells are opened, and\r\nthe fish washed clean; some water is then poured into a pot, the\r\noysters are put into it, and they must boil for a while; the pot is\r\nthen taken off from the fire again, the oysters taken out and put upon\r\na dish, till they are somewhat dry: then you take some mace, allspice,\r\nblack pepper, and as much vinegar as you think is sufficient to give a\r\nsourish taste. All this is mixed with half the liquor in which the\r\noysters were boiled, and put over the fire again. While you boil it\r\ngreat care is to be taken in scumming off the thick scum; at last the\r\nwhole pickle is poured into a glass or earthen vessel, the oysters are\r\nput to it, and the vessel is well stopped to keep out the air. In this\r\nmanner, oysters will keep for years together, and may be sent to the\r\nmost distant parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe merchants here buy up great quantities of oysters about this time,\r\npickle them in the above-mentioned manner, and send them to the West\r\nIndies: by which they frequently make a considerable profit: for, the\r\noysters, which cost them five shillings of their currency, they\r\ncommonly sell for a pistole, or about six times as much as they gave\r\nfor them; and sometimes they get even more: the oysters which are thus\r\npickled have a very fine flavour. The following is another way of\r\npreserving oysters: they are taken out of the shells, fried with\r\nbutter, put into a glass or earthen vessel with the melted butter over\r\nthem, so that they are quite covered with it, and no air can get to\r\nthem. Oysters prepared in this manner have likewise an agreeable taste,\r\nand are exported to the West Indies and other parts.\r\n\r\nOysters are here reckoned very wholesome, some people assured us, that\r\nthey had not felt the least inconvenience, after eating a considerable\r\nquantity of them. It is likewise a common rule here that oysters are\r\nbest in those months which have an r in their name, such as September,\r\nOctober, &c; but that they are not so good in other months; however\r\nthere are poor people, who live all the year long upon nothing but\r\noysters with bread.\r\n\r\nThe sea near New York, affords annually the greatest quantity of\r\noysters. They are found chiefly in a muddy ground, where they lie in\r\nthe slime, and are not so frequent in a sandy bottom: a rockey and a\r\nstony bottom is seldom found here. The oyster shells are gathered in\r\ngreat heaps, and burnt into a lime, which by some people is made use of\r\nin building houses, but is not reckoned so good as that made of\r\nlimestone. On our journey to New York, we saw high heaps of oyster\r\nshells near the farm-houses, upon the sea shore; and about New York, we\r\nobserved the people had carried them upon the fields which were sown\r\nwith wheat. However they were entire, and not crushed.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who inhabited the coast before the arrival of the\r\nEuropeans, have made oysters and other shell fish their chief food; and\r\nat present whenever they come to a salt water where oysters are to be\r\ngot, they are very active in catching them, and sell them in great\r\nquantities to other Indians who live higher up the country: for this\r\nreason you see immense numbers of oyster and muscle shells piled up\r\nnear such places, where you are certain that the Indians formerly built\r\ntheir huts. This circumstance ought to make us cautious in maintaining,\r\nthat in all places on the sea shore, or higher up in the country, where\r\nsuch heaps of shells are to be met with, the latter have lain there\r\never since the time that those places were overflowed by the sea.\r\n\r\nLobsters are likewise plentyfully caught hereabouts, pickled much in\r\nthe same way as oysters, and sent to several places. I was told of a\r\nvery remarkable circumstance about these lobsters, and I have\r\nafterwards frequently heard it mentioned. The coast of New York had\r\nalready European inhabitants for a considerable time, yet no lobsters\r\nwere to be met with on that coast; and though the people fished ever so\r\noften, they could never find any signs of lobsters being in this part\r\nof the sea: they were therefore continually brought in great wellboats\r\nfrom New England, where they are plentiful; but it happened that one of\r\nthese wellboats broke in pieces near Hellgate, about ten English miles\r\nfrom New York, and all the lobsters in it got off. Since that time they\r\nhave so multiplied in this part of the sea, that they are now caught in\r\nthe greatest abundance.\r\n\r\nNovember the 1st. A kind of cold fever, which the English in this\r\ncountry call Fever and Ague, is very common in several parts of the\r\nEnglish colonies. There are however other parts, where the people have\r\nnever felt it. I will in the sequel describe the symptoms of this\r\ndisease at large. Several of the most considerable inhabitants of this\r\ntown, assured me that this disease was not near so common in New York,\r\nas it is in Pensylvania, where ten were seized by it, to one in the\r\nformer province; therefore they were of opinion, that this disease was\r\noccasioned by the vapours arising from stagnant fresh water, from\r\nmarshes, and from rivers; for which reason those provinces situated on\r\nthe sea shore, could not be so much affected by it. However the\r\ncarelesness with which people eat quantities of melons, watermelons,\r\npeaches, and other juicy fruit in summer, was reckoned to contribute\r\nmuch towards the progress of this fever; and repeated examples\r\nconfirmed the truth of this opinion. The jesuit’s bark was reckoned a\r\ngood remedy against it. It has however often been found to have\r\noperated contrary to expectation, though I am ignorant whether it was\r\nadulterated, or whether some mistake had been committed in the manner\r\nof taking it. Mr. Davis van Horne, a merchant, told me that he cured\r\nhimself and several other people of this fever, by the leaves of the\r\ncommon Garden Sage, or Salvia officinalis of Linnæus. The leaves are\r\ncrushed or pounded in a mortar, and the juice is pressed out of them;\r\nthis is continued till they get a spoonful of the liquid, which is\r\nmixed with lemon juice. This draught is taken about the time that the\r\ncold fit comes on; and after taking it three or four times, the fever\r\ndoes not come again.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the white oak was reckoned the best remedy which had as yet\r\nbeen found against the dysentery. It is reduced to a powder, and then\r\ntaken: some people assured me that in cases where nothing would help,\r\nthis remedy had given a certain and speedy relief. The people in this\r\nplace likewise make use of this bark (as is usually done in the English\r\ncolonies) to dye wool a brown colour, which looks like that of bohea\r\ntea, and does not fade by being exposed to the sun. Among the numerous\r\nshells which are found on the sea shore, there are some which by the\r\nEnglish here are called Clams, and which bear some resemblance to the\r\nhuman ear. They have a considerable thickness, and are chiefly white,\r\nexcepting the pointed end, which both without and within has a blue\r\ncolour, between purple and violet. They are met with in vast numbers on\r\nthe sea shore of New York, Long Island, and other places. The shells\r\ncontain a large animal, which is eaten both by the Indians and\r\nEuropeans settled here.\r\n\r\nA considerable commerce is carried on in this article, with such\r\nIndians as live further up the country. When these people inhabited the\r\ncoast, they were able to catch their own clams, which at that time made\r\na great part of their food; but at present this is the business of the\r\nDutch and English, who live in Long Island and other maritime\r\nprovinces. As soon as the shells are caught, the fish is taken out of\r\nthem, drawn upon a wire, and hung up in the open air, in order to dry\r\nby the heat of the sun. When this is done, the fish is put into proper\r\nvessels, and carried to Albany upon the river Hudson; there the Indians\r\nbuy them, and reckon them one of their best dishes. Besides the\r\nEuropeans, many of the native Indians come annually down to the sea\r\nshore, in order to catch clams, proceeding with them afterwards in the\r\nmanner I have just described.\r\n\r\nThe shells of these clams are used by the Indians as money, and make\r\nwhat they call their wampum; they likewise serve their women for an\r\nornament, when they intend to appear in full dress. These wampums are\r\nproperly made of the purple parts of the shells, which the Indians\r\nvalue more than the white parts. A traveller, who goes to trade with\r\nthe Indians, and is well stocked with them, may become a considerable\r\ngainer; but if he take gold coin, or bullion, he will undoubtedly be a\r\nloser; for the Indians who live farther up the country, put little or\r\nno value upon these metals which we reckon so precious, as I have\r\nfrequently observed in the course of my travels. The Indians formerly\r\nmade their own wampums, though not without a deal of trouble: but at\r\npresent the Europeans employ themselves that way; especially the\r\ninhabitants of Albany, who get a considerable profit by it. In the\r\nsequel I intend to relate the manner of making the wampum.\r\n\r\nNovember the 2d. Besides the different sects of christians, there are\r\nmany Jews settled in New York, who possess great privileges. They have\r\na synagogue and houses, and great country seats of their own property,\r\nand are allowed to keep shops in town. They have likewise several\r\nships, which they freight and send out with their own goods. In fine\r\nthey enjoy all the privileges common to the other inhabitants of this\r\ntown and province.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence at New York, this time and in the two next years, I\r\nwas frequently in company with Jews. I was informed among other things,\r\nthat these people never boiled any meat for themselves on saturday, but\r\nthat they always did it the day before; and that in winter they kept a\r\nfire during the whole saturday. They commonly eat no pork; yet I have\r\nbeen told by several men of credit, that many of them (especially among\r\nthe young Jews) when travelling, did not not make the least difficulty\r\nabout eating this, or any other meat that was put before them; even\r\nthough they were in company with christians. I was in their synagogue\r\nlast evening for the first time, and this day at noon I visited it\r\nagain, and each time I was put into a particular seat which was set\r\napart for strangers or christians. A young Rabbi read the divine\r\nservice, which was partly in Hebrew, and partly in the Rabinical\r\ndialect. Both men and women were dressed entirely in the English\r\nfashion; the former had all of them their hats on, and did not once\r\ntake them off during service. The galleries, I observed, were\r\nappropriated to the ladies, while the men sat below. During prayers the\r\nmen spread a white cloth over their heads; which perhaps is to\r\nrepresent sack cloth. But I observed that the wealthier sort of people\r\nhad a much richer cloth than the poorer ones. Many of the men had\r\nHebrew books, in which they sang and read alternately. The Rabbi stood\r\nin the middle of the synagogue, and read with his face turned towards\r\nthe east; he spoke however so fast, as to make it almost impossible for\r\nany one to understand what he said. [40]\r\n\r\nNew York, the capital of a province of the same name is situated under\r\nforty deg. and forty min. north lat. and forty seven deg. and four min.\r\nof western long. from London; and is about ninety seven English miles\r\ndistant from Philadelphia. The situation of it is extremely\r\nadvantageous for trade: for the town stands upon a point which is\r\nformed by two bays; into one of which the river Hudson discharges\r\nitself, not far from the town; New York is therefore on three sides\r\nsurrounded with water; the ground it is built on, is level in some\r\nparts, and hilly in others: the place is generally reckoned very\r\nwholesome.\r\n\r\nThe town was first founded by the Dutch: this, it is said, was done in\r\nthe year 1623, when they were yet masters of the country: they called\r\nit New Amsterdam, and the country itself New Holland. The English,\r\ntowards the end of the year 1664, taking possession of it under the\r\nconduct of Des Cartes, and keeping it by the virtue of the next treaty\r\nof peace, gave the name of New York to both the town, and the province\r\nbelonging to it: in size it comes nearest to Boston and Philadelphia.\r\nBut with regard to its fine buildings, its opulence, and extensive\r\ncommerce, it disputes the preference with them: at present it is about\r\nhalf as big again as Gothenburgh in Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe streets do not run so straight as those of Philadelphia, and have\r\nsometimes considerable bendings: however they are very spacious and\r\nwell built, and most of them are paved, except in high places, where it\r\nhas been found useless. In the chief streets there are trees planted,\r\nwhich in summer give them a fine appearance, and during the excessive\r\nheat at that time, afford a cooling shade: I found it extremely\r\npleasant to walk in the town, for it seemed quite like a garden: the\r\ntrees which are planted for this purpose are chiefly of two kinds. The\r\nWater beech, or Linnæus’s Platanus occidentalis, are the most numerous,\r\nand give an agreeable shade in summer, by their great and numerous\r\nleaves. The Locust tree, or Linnæus’s Robinia Pseud-Acacia is likewise\r\nfrequent: its fine leaves, and the odoriferous scent which exhales from\r\nits flowers, make it very proper for being planted in the streets near\r\nthe houses, and in gardens. There are likewise lime trees and elms, in\r\nthese walks, but they are not by far so frequent as the others: one\r\nseldom met with trees of the same sort next to each other, they being\r\nin general planted alternately.\r\n\r\nBesides numbers of birds of all kinds which make these trees their\r\nabode, there are likewise a kind of frogs which frequent them in great\r\nnumbers in summer, they are Dr. Linnæus’s Rana arborea, and especially\r\nthe American variety of this animal. They are very clamorous in the\r\nevening and in the nights (especially when the days had been hot, and a\r\nrain was expected) and in a manner drown the singing of the birds. They\r\nfrequently make such a noise, that it is difficult for a person to make\r\nhimself heard.\r\n\r\nMost of the houses are built of bricks; and are generally strong and\r\nneat, and several stories high. Some had, according to old\r\narchitecture, turned the gable-end towards the streets; but the new\r\nhouses were altered in this respect. Many of the houses had a balcony\r\non the roof, on which the people used to sit in the evenings in the\r\nsummer season; and from thence they had a pleasant view of a great part\r\nof the town, and likewise of part of the adjacent water and of the\r\nopposite shore. The roofs are commonly covered with tiles or shingles:\r\nthe latter of which are made of the white firtree, or Pinus Strobus\r\n(Linn. sp. plant. page 1419.) which grows higher up in the country. The\r\ninhabitants are of opinion that a roof made of these shingles is as\r\ndurable as one made in Pensylvania of the White Cedar, or Cupressus\r\nthyoides (Linn. spec. plant, page 1422.) The walls were whitewashed\r\nwithin, and I did not any where see hangings, with which the people in\r\nthis country seem in general to be but little acquainted. The walls\r\nwere quite covered with all sorts of drawings and pictures in small\r\nframes. On each side of the chimnies they had usually a sort of alcove;\r\nand the wall under the windows was wainscoted, and had benches placed\r\nnear it. The alcoves, and all the wood work were painted with a bluish\r\ngrey colour.\r\n\r\nThere are several churches in the town, which deserve some attention.\r\n1. The English Church, built in the year 1695, at the west end of town,\r\nconsisting of stone, and has a steeple with a bell. 2. The new Dutch\r\nChurch, which is likewise built of stone, is pretty large and is\r\nprovided with a steeple, it also has a clock, which is the only one in\r\nthe town. This church stands almost due from north to south. No\r\nparticular point of the compass has here been in general attended to in\r\nerecting sacred buildings. Some churches, stand as is usual from east\r\nto west, others from south to north, and others in different positions.\r\nIn this Dutch church, there is neither altar, vestry, choir, sconces,\r\nnor paintings. Some trees are planted round it, which make it look as\r\nif it was built in a wood. 3. The old Dutch church, which is also built\r\nof stone. It is not so large as the new one. It was painted in the\r\ninside, though without any images, and adorned with a small organ, of\r\nwhich governor Burnet made them a present. The men for the most part\r\nsit in the gallery, and the women below. 4. The Presbyterian Church,\r\nwhich is pretty large, and was built but lately. It is of stone, and\r\nhas a steeple and a bell in it. 5. The German Lutheran Church. 6. The\r\nGerman Reformed Church. 7. The French Church, for protestant refugees.\r\n8. The Quaker’s Meeting house. 9. To these may be added the Jewish\r\nSynagogue, which I mentioned before.\r\n\r\nTowards the sea, on the extremity of the promontory is a pretty good\r\nfortress, called Fort George, which entirely commands the port, and can\r\ndefend the town, at least from a sudden attack on the sea side. Besides\r\nthat, it is likewise secured on the north or towards the shore, by a\r\npallisade, which however (as for a considerable time the people have\r\nhad nothing to fear from an enemy) is in many places in a very bad\r\nstate of defence.\r\n\r\nThere is no good water to be met with in the town itself, but at a\r\nlittle distance there is a large spring of good water, which the\r\ninhabitants take for their tea, and for the uses of the kitchen. Those\r\nhowever, who are less delicate in this point, make use of the water\r\nfrom the wells in town, though it be very bad. This want of good water\r\nlies heavy upon the horses of the strangers that come to this place;\r\nfor they do not like to drink the water from the wells in the town.\r\n\r\nThe port is a good one: ships of the greatest burthen can lie in it,\r\nquite close up to the bridge: but its water is very salt, as the sea\r\ncontinually comes in upon it; and therefore is never frozen, except in\r\nextraordinary cold weather. This is of great advantage to the city and\r\nits commerce; for many ships either come in or go out of the port at\r\nany time of the year; unless the winds be contrary; a convenience,\r\nwhich as I have before observed, is wanting at Philadelphia. It is\r\nsecured from all violent hurricanes from the south-east by Long Island\r\nwhich is situated just before the town: therefore only the storms from\r\nthe south-west are dangerous to the ships which ride at anchor here,\r\nbecause the port is open only on that side. The entrance however has\r\nits faults: one of them is, that no men of war can pass through it; for\r\nthough the water is pretty deep, yet it is not sufficiently so for\r\ngreat ships. Sometimes even merchant ships of a large size have by the\r\nrolling of the waves and by sinking down between them, slightly touched\r\nthe bottom, though without any bad consequences. Besides this, the\r\ncanal is narrow; and for this reason many ships have been lost here,\r\nbecause they may be easily cast upon a sand, if the ship is not well\r\npiloted. Some old people, who had constantly been upon this canal,\r\nassured me, that it was neither deeper, nor shallower at present, than\r\nin their youth.\r\n\r\nThe common difference between high and low water at New York, amounts\r\nto about six feet, English measure. But at a certain time in every\r\nmonth, when the tide flows more than commonly, the difference in the\r\nheight of the water is seven feet.\r\n\r\nNew York probably carries on a more extensive commerce, than any town\r\nin the English North American provinces; at least it may be said to\r\nequal them: Boston and Philadelphia however come very near up to it.\r\nThe trade of New York extends to many places, and it is said they send\r\nmore ships from thence to London, than they do from Philadelphia. They\r\nexport to that capital all the various sorts of skins which they buy of\r\nthe Indians, sugar, logwood, and other dying woods, rum, mahogany, and\r\nmany other goods which are the produce of the West Indies; together\r\nwith all the specie which they get in the course of trade. Every year\r\nthey build several ships here, which are sent to London, and there\r\nsold; and of late years they have shipped a quantity of iron to\r\nEngland. In return for these, they import from London stuffs and every\r\nother article of English growth or manufacture, together with all sorts\r\nof foreign goods. England, and especially London, profits immensely by\r\nits trade with the American colonies; for not only New York, but\r\nlikewise all the other English towns on the continent, import so many\r\narticles from England, that all their specie, together with the goods\r\nwhich they get in other countries, must altogether go to Old England,\r\nin order to pay the amount, to which they are however insufficient.\r\nFrom hence it appears how much a well regulated colony contributes to\r\nthe increase and welfare of its mother country.\r\n\r\nNew York sends many ships to the West Indies, with flour, corn,\r\nbiscuit, timber, tuns, boards, flesh, fish, butter, and other\r\nprovisions; together with some of the few fruits that grow here. Many\r\nships go to Boston in New England, with corn and flour, and take in\r\nexchange, flesh, butter, timber, different sorts of fish, and other\r\narticles, which they carry further to the West Indies. They now and\r\nthen take rum from thence, which is distilled there in great\r\nquantities, and sell it here with a considerable advantage. Sometimes\r\nthey send yachts with goods from New York to Philadelphia, and at other\r\ntimes yachts are sent from Philadelphia to New York; which is only\r\ndone, as appears from the gazettes, because certain articles are\r\ncheaper at one place than at the other. They send ships to Ireland\r\nevery year, laden with all kinds of West India goods; but especially\r\nwith linseed, which is reaped in this province. I have been assured,\r\nthat in some years no less than ten ships have been sent to Ireland,\r\nladen with nothing but linseed; because it is said the flax in Ireland\r\ndoes not afford good seed. But probably the true reason is this: the\r\npeople of Ireland, in order to have the better flax, make use of the\r\nplant before the seed is ripe, and therefore are obliged to send for\r\nforeign seed; and hence it becomes one of the chief articles in trade.\r\n\r\nAt this time a bushel of linseed is sold for eight shillings of New\r\nYork currency, or exactly a piece of eight.\r\n\r\nThe goods which are shipped to the West Indies, are sometimes paid for\r\nwith ready money, and sometimes with West India goods, which are either\r\nfirst brought to New York, or immediately sent to England or Holland.\r\nIf a ship does not chuse to take in West India goods in its return to\r\nNew York, or if no body will freight it, it often goes to Newcastle in\r\nEngland to take in coals for ballast, which when brought home sell for\r\na pretty good price. In many parts of the town coals are made use of,\r\nboth for kitchen fires, and in rooms, because they are reckoned cheaper\r\nthan wood, which at present costs thirty Shillings of New York currency\r\nper fathom; of which measure I have before made mention. New York has\r\nlikewise some intercourse with South Carolina; to which it sends corn,\r\nflour, sugar, rum, and other goods, and takes rice in return, which is\r\nalmost the only commodity exported from South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe goods with which the province of New York trades are not very\r\nnumerous. They chiefly export the skins of animals, which are bought of\r\nthe Indians about Oswego; great quantities of boards, coming for the\r\nmost part from Albany; timber and ready made lumber, from that part of\r\nthe country which lies about the river Hudson; and lastly wheat, flour,\r\nbarley, oats and other kinds of corn, which are brought from New Jersey\r\nand the cultivated parts of this province. I have seen yachts from New\r\nBrunswick, laden with wheat which lay loose on board, and with flour\r\npacked up into tuns; and also with great quantities of linseed. New\r\nYork likewise exports some flesh and other provisions out of its own\r\nprovince, but they are very few; nor is the quantity of pease which the\r\npeople about Albany bring much greater. Iron however may be had more\r\nplentifully, as it is found in several parts of this province, and is\r\nof a considerable goodness; but all the other products of this country\r\nare of little account.\r\n\r\nMost of the wine, which is drank here and in the other colonies is\r\nbrought from the Isle of Madeira and is very strong and fiery.\r\n\r\nNo manufactures of note have as yet been established here; at present\r\nthey get all manufactured goods, such as woollen and linen cloth, &c.\r\nfrom England, and especially from London.\r\n\r\nThe river Hudson is very convenient for the commerce of this city; as\r\nit is navigable for near a hundred and fifty English miles up the\r\ncountry, and falls into the bay not far from the town, on its western\r\nside. During eight months of the year this river is full of yachts, and\r\nother greater and lesser vessels, either going to New York or returning\r\nfrom thence, laden either with inland or foreign goods.\r\n\r\nI cannot make a just estimate of the ships that annually come to this\r\ntown or sail from it. But I have found by the Pensylvania gazettes that\r\nfrom the first of December in 1729, to the fifth of December in the\r\nnext year, 211 ships entered the port of New York, and 222 cleared it;\r\nand since that time there has been a great increase of trade here.\r\n\r\nThe country people come to market in New York, twice a week much in the\r\nsame manner, as they do at Philadelphia; with this difference, that the\r\nmarkets are here kept in several places.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the province of New York, resides here, and has a\r\npalace in the fort. Among those who have been entrusted with this post,\r\nWilliam Burnet deserves to be had in perpetual remembrance. He was one\r\nof the sons of Dr. Thomas Burnet (so celebrated on account of his\r\nlearning) and seemed to have inherited the knowledge of his father. But\r\nhis great assiduity in promoting the welfare of this province, is what\r\nmakes the principal merit of his character. The people of New York\r\ntherefore still reckon him the best governor they ever had, and think\r\nthat they cannot praise his services too much. The many astronomical\r\nobservations which he made in these parts, are inserted in several\r\nEnglish works. In the year 1727, at the accession of king George the\r\nII. to the throne of Great Britain, he was appointed governor of New\r\nEngland. In consequence of this he left New York, and went to Boston,\r\nwhere he died universally lamented, on the 7th. of September 1729.\r\n\r\nAn assembly of deputies from all the particular districts of the\r\nprovince of New York, is held at New York once or twice every year. It\r\nmay be looked upon as a parliament or dyet in miniature. Every thing\r\nrelating to the good of the province is here debated. The governor\r\ncalls the assembly, and dissolves it at pleasure: this is a power which\r\nhe ought only to make use of, either when no farther debates are\r\nnecessary, or when the members are not so unanimous in the service of\r\ntheir king and country as is their duty: it frequently however happens,\r\nthat, led aside by caprice or by interested views, he exerts it to the\r\nprejudice of the province. The colony has sometimes had a governor,\r\nwhose quarrels with the inhabitants, have induced their\r\nrepresentatives, or the members of the assembly, through a spirit of\r\nrevenge, to oppose indifferently every thing he proposed, whether it\r\nwas beneficial to the country or not. In such cases the governor has\r\nmade use of his power; dissolving the assembly, and calling another\r\nsoon after, which however he again dissolved upon the least mark of\r\ntheir ill humour. By this means he so much tired them, by the many\r\nexpences which they were forced to bear in so short a time, that they\r\nwere at last glad to unite with him, in his endeavours for the good of\r\nthe province. But there have likewise been governors who have called\r\nassemblies and dissolved them soon after, merely because the\r\nrepresentatives did not act according to their whims, or would not give\r\ntheir assent to proposals which were perhaps dangerous or hurtful to\r\nthe common welfare.\r\n\r\nThe king appoints the governor according to his royal pleasure; but the\r\ninhabitants of the province make up his excellency’s salary. Therefore\r\na man entrusted with this place has greater or lesser revenues,\r\naccording as he knows how to gain the confidence of the inhabitants.\r\nThere are examples of governors in this, and other provinces of North\r\nAmerica, who by their dissensions with the inhabitants of their\r\nrespective governments, have lost their whole salary, his Majesty\r\nhaving no power to make them pay it. If a governor had no other\r\nresource in these circumstances, he would be obliged either to resign\r\nhis office, or to be content with an income too small for his dignity;\r\nor else to conform himself in every thing to the inclinations of the\r\ninhabitants: but there are several stated profits, which in some\r\nmeasure make up for this. 1. No one is allowed to keep a public house\r\nwithout the governor’s leave; which is only to be obtained by the\r\npayment of a certain fee, according to the circumstances of the person.\r\nSome governors therefore, when the inhabitants refused to pay them a\r\nsalary, have hit upon the expedient of doubling the number of inns in\r\ntheir province. 2. Few people who intend to be married, unless they be\r\nvery poor, will have their banns published from the pulpit; but instead\r\nof this they get licences from the governor, which impower any minister\r\nto marry them. Now for such a licence the governor receives about half\r\na guinea, and this collected throughout the whole province, amounts to\r\na considerable sum. 3. The governor signs all passports, and especially\r\nof such as go to sea; and this gives him another means of supplying his\r\nexpences. There are several other advantages allowed to him, but as\r\nthey are very trifling, I shall omit them.\r\n\r\nAt the above assembly the old laws are reviewed and amended, and new\r\nones are made: and the regulation and circulation of coin, together\r\nwith all other affairs of that kind are there determined. For it is to\r\nbe observed that each English colony in North America is independent of\r\nthe other, and that each has its proper laws and coin, and may be\r\nlooked upon in several lights, as a state by itself. From hence it\r\nhappens, that in time of war, things go on very slowly and irregularly\r\nhere: for not only the sense of one province is sometimes directly\r\nopposite to that of another; but frequently the views of the governor,\r\nand those of the assembly of the same province, are quite different: so\r\nthat it is easy to see, that, while the people are quarrelling about\r\nthe best and cheapest manner of carrying on the war, an enemy has it in\r\nhis power to take one place after another. It has commonly happened\r\nthat whilst some provinces have been suffering from their enemies, the\r\nneighbouring ones were quiet and inactive, and as if it did not in the\r\nleast concern them. They have frequently taken up two or three years in\r\nconsidering whether they should give assistance to an oppressed sister\r\ncolony, and sometimes they have expresly declared themselves against\r\nit. There are instances of provinces who were not only neuter in these\r\ncircumstances, but who even carried on a great trade with the power\r\nwhich at that very time was attacking and laying waste some other\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nThe French in Canada, who are but an inconsiderable body, in comparison\r\nwith the English in America, have by this position of affairs been able\r\nto obtain great Advantages in times of war; for if we judge from the\r\nnumber and power of the English, it would seem very easy for them to\r\nget the better of the French in America. [41]\r\n\r\nIt is however of great advantage to the crown of England, that the\r\nNorth American colonies are near a country, under the government of the\r\nFrench, like Canada. There is reason to believe that the king never was\r\nearnest in his attempts to expel the French from their possessions\r\nthere; though it might have been done with little difficulty. For the\r\nEnglish colonies in this part of the world have encreased so much in\r\ntheir number of inhabitants, and in their riches, that they almost vie\r\nwith Old England. Now in order to keep up the authority and trade of\r\ntheir mother country, and to answer several other puposes, they are\r\nforbid to establish new manufactures, which would turn to the\r\ndisadvantage of the British commerce: they are not allowed to dig for\r\nany gold or silver, unless they send them to England immediately: they\r\nhave not the liberty of trading to any parts that do not belong to the\r\nBritish dominions, excepting some settled places, and foreign traders\r\nare not allowed to send their ships to them. These and some other\r\nrestrictions, occasion the inhabitants of the English colonies to grow\r\nless tender for their mother country. This coldness is kept up by the\r\nmany foreigners such as Germans, Dutch and French settled here, and\r\nliving among the English, who commonly have no particular attachment to\r\nOld England; add to this likewise that many people can never be\r\ncontented with their possessions, though they be ever so great, and\r\nwill always be desirous of getting more, and of enjoying the pleasure\r\nwhich arises from changing; and their over great liberty, and their\r\nluxury often lead them to licentiousness.\r\n\r\nI have been told by Englishmen, and not only by such as were born in\r\nAmerica, but even by such as came from Europe, that the English\r\ncolonies in North-America, in the space of thirty or fifty years, would\r\nbe able to form a state by themselves, entirely independent on Old\r\nEngland. But as the whole country which lies along the sea shore, is\r\nunguarded, and on the land side is harrassed by the French, in times of\r\nwar these dangerous neighbours are sufficient to prevent the connection\r\nof the colonies with their mother country from being quite broken off.\r\nThe English government has therefore sufficient reason to consider the\r\nFrench in North-America, as the best means of keeping the colonies in\r\ntheir due submission. But, I am almost gone too far from my purpose; I\r\nwill therefore finish my observations on New York.\r\n\r\nThe declination of the magnetic needle, in this town was observed by\r\nPhilip Wells, the chief engineer of the province of New York, in the\r\nyear 1686, to be eight deg. and forty-five min. to the westward. But in\r\n1723, it was only seven deg. and twenty min. according to the\r\nobservations of governor Burnet.\r\n\r\nFrom hence we may conclude that in thirty-eight years the magnet\r\napproaches about one deg. and twenty five min. nearer to the true\r\nnorth; or, which is the same thing, about two min. annually. Mr.\r\nAlexander, a man of great knowledge in astronomy and in mathematics,\r\nassured me from several observations, that in the year 1750, on the\r\neighteenth of September the deviation was to be reckoned six deg. and\r\ntwenty two min.\r\n\r\nThere are two printers in the town, and every week some English\r\ngazettes are published, which contain news from all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe winter is much more severe here, than in Pensylvania; it being\r\nnearly as cold as in some of the provinces of Sweden: its continuance\r\nhowever is much shorter than with us: their spring is very early and\r\ntheir autumn very late, and the heat in summer is excessive. For this\r\nreason, the melons sown in the fields are ripe at the beginning of\r\nAugust; whereas we can hardly bring them so soon to maturity under\r\nglasses and on hot beds. The cold of the winter, I cannot justly\r\ndetermine, as the meteorological observations which were communicated\r\nto me, were all calculated after thermometers, which were so placed in\r\nthe houses, that the air could not freely come at them. The snow lies\r\nfor some months together upon the ground; and sledges are made use of\r\nhere as in Sweden, but they are rather too bulky. The river Hudson is\r\nabout an English mile and a half broad at its mouth: the difference\r\nbetween the highest flood and the lowest ebb is between six and seven\r\nfeet, and the water is very brackish: yet the ice stands in it not only\r\none but even several months: it has sometimes a thickness of more than\r\ntwo feet.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are sometimes greatly troubled with Musquitoes. They\r\neither follow the hay which is made near the town, in the low meadows\r\nwhich are quite penetrated with salt water; or they accompany the\r\ncattle at night when it is brought home. I have myself experienced, and\r\nhave observed in others, how much these little animalcules can\r\ndisfigure a person’s face during a single night; for the skin is\r\nsometimes so covered over with little blisters from their stings, that\r\npeople are ashamed to appear in public. The water melons which are\r\ncultivated near the town grow very large: they are extremely delicious,\r\nand are better than in other parts of North America; though they are\r\nplanted in the open fields and never in a hot-bed. I saw a water melon\r\nat Governor Clinton’s in September 1750, which weighed forty seven\r\nEnglish pounds, and at a merchant’s in town another of forty two pounds\r\nweight: however they were reckoned the biggest ever seen in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1710, five kings, or Sachems of the Iroquois went from\r\nhence to England, in order to engage Queen Anne to make an alliance\r\nwith them against the French. Their names, dress, reception at court,\r\nspeeches to the Queen, opinion of England and of the European manners,\r\nand several other particulars about them are sufficiently known from\r\nother writings; it would therefore be here unnecessary to enlarge about\r\nthem. The kings or Sachems of the Indians, have commonly no greater\r\nauthority over their subjects than constables in a meeting of the\r\ninhabitants of a parish, and hardly so much. On my travels through the\r\ncountry of these Indians, I had never any occasion to go and wait upon\r\nthe Sachems; for they always came into my habitation without being\r\nasked: these visits they commonly paid in order to get a glass or two\r\nof brandy, which they value above any thing they know. One of the five\r\nSachems mentioned above, died in England; the others returned safe.\r\n\r\nThe first colonists in New York were Dutchmen: when the town and its\r\nterritories were taken by the English, and left them by the next peace\r\nin exchange for Surinam, the old inhabitants were allowed either to\r\nremain at New York, and to enjoy all the privileges and immunities\r\nwhich they were possessed of before, or to leave the place with all\r\ntheir goods: most of them chose the former; and therefore the\r\ninhabitants both of the town and of the province belonging to it, are\r\nyet for the greatest part Dutchmen; who still, especially the old\r\npeople, speak their mother tongue.\r\n\r\nThey begin however by degrees to change their manners and opinions;\r\nchiefly indeed in the town and in its neighbourhood: for most of the\r\nyoung people now speak principally English, and go only to the English\r\nchurch; and would even take it amiss, if they were called Dutchmen and\r\nnot Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThough the province of New York has been inhabited by Europeans, much\r\nlonger than Pensylvania, yet it is not by far so populous as that\r\ncolony. This cannot be ascribed to any particular discouragement\r\narising from the nature of the soil; for that is pretty good: but I was\r\ntold of a very different reason, which I will mention here. In the\r\nreign of Queen Anne about the year 1709, many Germans came hither, who\r\ngot a tract of land from the government on which they might settle.\r\nAfter they had lived there for some time, and had built houses and\r\nchurches, and made corn-fields and meadows, their liberties and\r\nprivileges were infringed, and under several pretences they were\r\nrepeatedly deprived of parts of their land. This at last rouzed the\r\nGermans; they returned violence for violence, and beat those who thus\r\nrobbed them of their possessions. But these proceedings were looked\r\nupon in a very bad light by the government: the most active people\r\namong the Germans being taken up, they were very roughly treated, and\r\npunished with the utmost rigour of the law. This however so far\r\nexasperated the rest, that the greater part of them left their houses\r\nand fields, and went to settle in Pensylvania: there they were\r\nexceedingly well received, got a considerable tract of land, and were\r\nindulged in great privileges which were given them forever. The Germans\r\nnot satisfied with being themselves removed from New York, wrote to\r\ntheir relations and friends and advised them, if ever they intended to\r\ncome to America, not to go to New York, where the government had shewn\r\nitself so unequitable. This advice had such influence, that the\r\nGermans, who afterwards went in great numbers to North America,\r\nconstantly avoided New York and always went to Pensylvania. It\r\nsometimes happened that they were forced to go on board such ships as\r\nwere bound to New York; but they were scarce got on shore, when they\r\nhastened on to Pensylvania in sight of all the inhabitants of New York.\r\n\r\nBut the want of people in this province may likewise be accounted for\r\nin a different manner. As the Dutch, who first cultivated this country,\r\nobtained the liberty of staying here by the treaty with England, and of\r\nenjoying all their privileges and advantages without the least\r\nlimitation, each of them took a very large piece of ground for himself,\r\nand many of the more powerful heads of families made themselves the\r\npossessors and masters of a country of as great an extent as would be\r\nsufficient to form a middling and even a great parish. Most of them\r\nbeing very rich, their envy of the English led them not to sell them\r\nany land, but at an excessive rate; a practice which is still\r\npunctually observed among their descendants. The English therefore as\r\nwell as people of different nations, have little encouragement to\r\nsettle here. On the other hand they have sufficient opportunity in the\r\nother provinces, to purchase land at a more moderate price, and with\r\nmore security to themselves. It is not then to be wondered, that so\r\nmany parts of New York are still uncultivated, and have entirely the\r\nappearance of desarts. This instance may teach us how much a small\r\nmistake in a government will injure population.\r\n\r\nNovember the 3d. About noon we set out from New York on our return, and\r\ncontinuing our journey, we arrived at Philadelphia on the fifth of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of this capital (of Pensylvania) the people had a\r\nmonth ago made their cyder, which they were obliged to do, because\r\ntheir apples were so ripe as to drop from the trees. But on our journey\r\nthrough New York we observed the people still employed in pressing out\r\nthe cyder. This is a plain proof that in Pensylvania the apples are\r\nsooner ripe than in New York; but whether this be owing to the nature\r\nof the soil, or a greater heat of the summer in Philadelphia, or to\r\nsome other cause I know not. However there is not the least advantage\r\nin making cyder so early: for long experience had taught the husbandmen\r\nthat it is worse for being made early in the year; the great heat in\r\nthe beginning of autumn being said to hinder the fermentation of the\r\njuice.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain quadruped which is pretty common not only in\r\nPensylvania, but likewise in other provinces both of South and North\r\nAmerica, and goes by the name of Polecat among the English. In New York\r\nthey generally call it Skunk. The Swedes here by way of nickname called\r\nit Fiskatta, on account of the horrid stench it sometimes causes as I\r\nshall presently show. The French in Canada, for the same reason call it\r\nBête puante or stinking animal, and Enfant du diable or child of the\r\ndevil. Some of them likewise call it Pekan: Catesby in his Natural\r\nHistory of Carolina, has described it in Vol. 2. p. 62. by the name of\r\nPutorius Americanus striatus and drawn it plate 62. Dr. Linnæus calls\r\nit Viverra Putorius. [42] This animal, which is very similar to the\r\nMarten, is of about the same size and commonly black: on the back it\r\nhas a longitudinal white stripe and two others on each side, parallel\r\nto the former. Sometimes but very seldom, some are seen which are quite\r\nwhite. On our return to Philadelphia we saw one of these animals not\r\nfar from town near a farmer’s house, killed by dogs. And afterwards I\r\nhad during my stay in these parts several opportunities of seeing it\r\nand of hearing its qualities. It keeps its young ones in holes in the\r\nground and in hollow trees; for it does not confine itself to the\r\nground, but climbs up trees with the greatest agility: it is a great\r\nenemy to birds; for it breaks their eggs and devours their young ones;\r\nand if it can get into a hen roost it soon destroys all its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThis animal has a particular quality by which it is principally known;\r\nwhen it is pursued by men or dogs it runs at first as fast as it can,\r\nor climbs upon a tree; but if it is so beset by its pursuers, as to\r\nhave no other way of making its escape, it squirts its urine upon them.\r\nThis according to some it does by wetting its tail with the urine\r\nwhence by a sudden motion it scatters it abroad; but others believe,\r\nthat it could send its urine equally far without the help of its tail;\r\nI find the former of these accounts to be the most likely. For, some\r\ncredible people assured me, that they have had their faces wetted with\r\nit all over; though they stood above eighteen feet off from the animal.\r\nThe urine has so horrid a stench that nothing can equal it: it is\r\nsomething like that of the Cranesbill or Linnæus’s Geranium\r\nrobertianum, but infinitely stronger. If you come near a polecat when\r\nit spreads its stench, you cannot breathe for a while, and it seems as\r\nif you were stifled; and in case the urine comes into the eyes, a\r\nperson is likely to be blinded. Many dogs that in a chace pursue the\r\npolecat very eagerly, run away as fast as they can when they are\r\nwetted: however, if they be of the true breed, they will not give over\r\nthe pursuit till they have caught and killed the polecat; but they are\r\nobliged now and then to rub their noses in the ground in order to\r\nrelieve themselves.\r\n\r\nClothes which have been wetted by this animal retain the smell for more\r\nthan a month; unless they be covered with fresh soil, and suffered to\r\nremain under it for twenty four hours together; when it will in a great\r\nmeasure be removed. Those likewise who have got any of this urine upon\r\ntheir face and hands, rub them with loose earth; and some even hold\r\ntheir hands in the ground for an hour; as washing will not help them so\r\nsoon. A certain man of rank who had by accident been wetted by the\r\npolecat, stunk so ill, that on going into a house, the people either\r\nran away, or on his opening the door, rudely denied him entrance. Dogs\r\nthat have hunted a polecat are so offensive for some days afterwards,\r\nthat they cannot be borne in the house. At Philadelphia I once saw a\r\ngreat number of people on a market day throwing at a dog that was so\r\nunfortunate as to have been engaged with a polecat just before, and to\r\ncarry about him the tokens of its displeasure. Persons when travelling\r\nthrough a forest are often troubled with the stink which this creature\r\nmakes; and sometimes the air is so much infected that it is necessary\r\nto hold ones nose. If the wind blows from the place where the polecat\r\nhas been, or if it be quite calm, as at night, the smell is more strong\r\nand disagreeable.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1749, a polecat tempted by a dead lamb, came one night\r\nnear the farm house where I then slept. Being immediately pursued by\r\nsome dogs, it had recourse to its usual expedient in order to get rid\r\nof them. The attempt succeeded, the dogs not choosing to continue the\r\npursuit: the stink was so extremely great that, though I was at some\r\ndistance it affected me in the same manner as if I had been stifled;\r\nand it was so disagreeable to the cattle that it made them roar very\r\nloudly: however, by degrees it vanished. Towards the end of the same\r\nyear one of these animals got into our cellar, but no stench was\r\nobserved, for it only vents that when it is pursued. The cook however\r\nfound for several days together that some of the meat which was kept\r\nthere was eaten; and suspecting that it was done by the cat she shut up\r\nall avenues, in order to prevent their getting at it. But the next\r\nnight being awoke by a noise in the cellar, she went down, and though\r\nit was quite dark, saw an animal with two shining eyes, which seemed to\r\nbe all on fire; she however resolutely killed it, but not before the\r\npolecat had filled the cellar with a most dreadful stench. The maid was\r\nsick of it for several days; and all the bread, flesh, and other\r\nprovisions kept in the cellar were so penetrated with it, that we could\r\nnot make the least use of them, and were forced to throw them all away.\r\n\r\nFrom an accident that happened at New York to one of my acquaintances,\r\nI conclude that the polecat either is not always very shy, or that it\r\nsleeps very hard at night. This man coming home out of a wood in a\r\nsummer evening, thought that he saw a plant standing before him;\r\nstooping to pluck it, he was to his cost convinced of his mistake, by\r\nbeing all on a sudden covered with the urine of a polecat, whose tail\r\nas it stood upright, the good man had taken for a plant: the creature\r\nhad taken its revenge so effectually that he was much at a loss how to\r\nget rid of the stench.\r\n\r\nHowever though these animals play such disagreeable tricks, yet the\r\nEnglish, the Swedes, the French, and the Indians in these parts tame\r\nthem. They follow their masters like domestic animals, and never make\r\nuse of their urine, except they be very much beaten or terrified. When\r\nthe Indians kill such a polecat, they always eat its flesh, but when\r\nthey pull off its skin, they take care to cut away the bladder, that\r\nthe flesh may not get a taste from it. I have spoken with both\r\nEnglishmen and Frenchmen, who assured me that they had eaten of it, and\r\nfound it very good meat, and not much unlike the flesh of a pig. The\r\nskin which is pretty coarse, and has long hair, is not made use of by\r\nthe Europeans; but the Indians prepare it with the hair on, and make\r\ntobacco pouches of it, which they carry before them.\r\n\r\nNovember the 6th. In the evening I went out of town to Mr. Bartram, I\r\nfound a man with him, who lived in Carolina and I obtained several\r\nparticulars about that province from him; a few of which I will here\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nTar, pitch and rice are the chief products of Carolina. The soil is\r\nvery sandy, and therefore many pines and firs grow in it, from which\r\nthey make tar: the firs which are taken for this purpose are commonly\r\nsuch as are dried up of themselves; the people here in general not\r\nknowing how to prepare the firs by taking the bark off on one, or on\r\nseveral sides, as they do in Ostrobothnia. In some parts of Carolina\r\nthey likewise make use of the branches. The manner of burning or\r\nboiling, as the man describes it to me, is entirely the same as in\r\nFinland. The pitch is thus made: they dig a hole into the ground and\r\nsmear the inside well with clay, into which they pour the tar, and make\r\na fire round it, which is kept up till the tar has got the consistence\r\nof pitch. They make two kinds of tar in the North American colonies:\r\none is the common tar, which I have above described, and which is made\r\nof the stems, branches, and roots of such firs, as were already\r\nconsiderably dried out before; which is the most common way in this\r\ncountry. The other way in peeling the bark from the firs on one side,\r\nand afterwards letting them stand another year; during which the resin\r\ncomes out between the cracks of the item. The tree is then felled and\r\nburnt for tar; and the tar thus made is called green tar, not that\r\nthere is that difference of colour in it, for in this respect they are\r\nboth pretty much alike; but the latter is called so from being made of\r\ngreen and fresh trees; whereas common tar is made of dead trees: the\r\nburning is done in the same manner as in Finland. They use only black\r\nfirs; for the white firs will not serve this purpose, though they are\r\nexcellent for boards, masts, &c. green tar is dearer than common tar.\r\nIt is already a pretty general complaint that the fir woods are almost\r\nwholly destroyed by this practice.\r\n\r\nRice is planted in great quantity in Carolina: it succeeds best in\r\nmarshy and swampy grounds, which may be laid under water, and likewise\r\nripens there the soonest. Where these cannot be had, they must choose a\r\ndry soil; but the rice produced here will be much inferior to the\r\nother: the land on which it is cultivated must never be manured. In\r\nCarolina they sow it in the middle of April, and it is ripe in\r\nSeptember: it is planted in rows like pease, and commonly fifteen\r\ninches space is left between the rows; as soon as the plants are come\r\nup, the field is laid under water. This not only greatly forwards the\r\ngrowth of the rice, but likewise kills all weeds, so as to render\r\nweeding unnecessary. The straw of rice is said to be excellent food for\r\ncattle, who eat it very greedily. Rice requires a hot climate, and\r\ntherefore it will not succeed well in Virginia, the summer there being\r\ntoo short, and the winter too cold; and much less will it grow in\r\nPensylvania. They are as yet ignorant in Carolina of the art of making\r\narrack from rice: it is chiefly South Carolina that produces the\r\ngreatest quantity of rice; and on the other hand they make the most tar\r\nin North Carolina.\r\n\r\nNovember the 7th. The stranger from Carolina whom I have mentioned\r\nbefore, had met with many oyster shells at the bottom of a well,\r\nseventy English miles distant from the sea, and four from a river: they\r\nlay in a depth of fourteen English feet from the surface of the earth:\r\nthe water in the well was brackish; but that in the river was fresh.\r\nThe same man, had at the building of a saw-mill, a mile and a half from\r\na river, found, first sand, and then clay filled with oyster shells.\r\nUnder these he found several bills of sea birds as he called them,\r\nwhich were already quite petrified: they were probably Glossopetræ.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of foxes in the English colonies, the one grey,\r\nand the other red: but in the sequel I shall shew that there are others\r\nwhich sometimes appear in Canada. The grey foxes are here constantly,\r\nand are very common in Pensylvania and in the southern provinces: in\r\nthe northern ones they are pretty scarce, and the French in Canada,\r\ncall them Virginian Foxes on that account: in size they do not quite\r\ncome up to our foxes. They do no harm to lambs; but they prey upon all\r\nsorts of poultry, whenever they can come at them. They do not however\r\nseem to be looked upon as animals that cause a great deal of damage;\r\nfor there is no reward given for killing them: their skin is greatly\r\nsought for by hatters, who employ the hair in their work. People have\r\ntheir clothes lined with it sometimes: the grease is used against all\r\nsorts of rheumatic pains. These foxes are said to be less nimble than\r\nthe red ones: they are sometimes tamed; though they be not suffered to\r\nrun about but are tied up. Mr. Catesby has drawn and described this\r\nsort of foxes in his Natural history of Carolina, by the name of the\r\ngrey American fox, vol. 2. p. 78. tab. 78. A skin of it was sold in\r\nPhiladelphia for two shillings and six-pence in Pensylvanian currency.\r\n\r\nThe red Foxes are very scarce here: they are entirely the same with the\r\nEuropean sort. Mr. Bartram, and several others assured me, that\r\naccording to the unanimous testimony of the Indians, this kind of foxes\r\nnever was in the country, before the Europeans settled in it. But of\r\nthe manner of their coming over I have two different accounts: Mr.\r\nBartram and several other people were told by the Indians, that these\r\nfoxes came into America soon after the arrival of the Europeans, after\r\nan extraordinary cold winter, when all the sea to the northward was\r\nfrozen: from hence they would infer, that they could perhaps get over\r\nto America upon the ice from Greenland or the northern parts of Europe\r\nand Asia. But Mr. Evans, and some others assured me that the following\r\naccount was still known by the people. A gentleman of fortune in New\r\nEngland, who had a great inclination for hunting, brought over a great\r\nnumber of foxes from Europe, and let them loose in his territories,\r\nthat he might be able to indulge his passion for hunting. [43] This is\r\nsaid to have happened almost at the very beginning of New England’s\r\nbeing peopled with European inhabitants. These foxes were believed to\r\nhave so multiplied, that all the red foxes in the country were their\r\noffspring. At present they are reckoned among the noxious creatures in\r\nthese parts; for they are not contented, as the grey foxes with killing\r\nfowl; but they likewise devour the lambs. In Pensylvania therefore\r\nthere is a reward of two shillings for killing an old fox, and of one\r\nshilling for killing a young one. And in all the other provinces there\r\nare likewise rewards offer’d for killing them, Their skin is in great\r\nrequest, and is sold as dear as that of the grey foxes, that is two\r\nshillings and six-pence, in Pensylvanian currency.\r\n\r\nThey have two varieties of Wolves here, which however seem to be of the\r\nsame species. For some of them are yellowish, or almost pale grey, and\r\nothers are black or dark brown. All the old Swedes related, that during\r\ntheir childhood, and still more at the arrival of their fathers, there\r\nwere excessive numbers of wolves in the country, and that their howling\r\nand yelping might be heard all night. They likewise frequently tore in\r\npieces, sheep, hogs, and other young and small cattle. About that time\r\nor soon after, when the Swedes and the English were quite settled here,\r\nthe Indians were attacked by the small pox: this disease they got from\r\nthe Europeans, for they knew nothing of it before: it killed many\r\nhundreds of them, and most of the Indians of the country, then called\r\nNew Sweden died of it. The wolves then came, attracted by the stench of\r\nso many corpses, in such great numbers that they devoured them all, and\r\neven attacked the poor sick Indians in their huts, so that the few\r\nhealthy ones had enough to do, to drive them away. But since that time\r\nthey have disappeared, so that they are now seldom seen, and it is very\r\nrarely that they commit any disorders. This is attributed to the\r\ngreater cultivation of the country, and to their being killed in great\r\nnumbers. But further up the country, where it is not yet so much\r\ninhabited, they are still very abundant. On the coasts of Pensylvania\r\nand New Jersey, the sheep stay all night in the fields, without the\r\npeople’s fearing the wolves: however to prevent their multiplying too\r\nmuch, there is a reward of twenty shillings in Pensylvania and of\r\nthirty in New Jersey, for delivering in a dead wolf, and the person\r\nthat brings it may keep the skin. But for a young wolf the reward is\r\nonly ten shillings of the Pensylvanian currency. There are examples of\r\nthese wolves being made as tame as dogs.\r\n\r\nThe wild Oxen have their abode principally in the woods of Carolina,\r\nwhich are far up in the country. The inhabitants frequently hunt them,\r\nand salt their flesh like common beef, which is eaten by servants and\r\nthe lower class of people. But the hide is of little use, having too\r\nlarge pores to be made use of for shoes. However the poorer people in\r\nCarolina, spread these hides on the ground instead of beds.\r\n\r\nThe Viscum filamentosum, or Fibrous misletoe, is found in abundance in\r\nCarolina; the inhabitants make use of it as straw in their beds, and to\r\nadorn their houses; the cattle are very fond of it: it is likewise\r\nemployed in packing goods.\r\n\r\nThe Spartium scoparium grew in Mr. Bartram’s garden from English seeds;\r\nhe said that he had several bushes of it, but that the frost in the\r\ncold winters here had killed most of them: they however grow\r\nspontaneously in Sweden.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram had same Truffles, or Linnæus’s Lycoperdon Tuber, which he\r\nhad got out of a sandy soil in New Jersey, where they are abundant.\r\nThese he shewed to his friend from Carolina, and asked him whether they\r\nwere the Tuckahoo of the Indians. But the stranger denied it, and added\r\nthat though these truffles were likewise very common in Carolina, yet\r\nhe had never seen them used any other way but in milk, against the\r\ndysentery; and he gave us the following description of the Tuckahoo. It\r\ngrows in several swamps and marches, and is commonly plentiful. The\r\nhogs greedily dig up its roots with their noses in such places; and the\r\nIndians in Carolina likewise gather them in their rambles in the woods,\r\ndry them in the sun shine, grind them and bake bread of them. Whilst\r\nthe root is fresh it is harsh and acrid, but being dried it loses the\r\ngreatest part of its acrimony. To judge by these qualities the Tuckahoo\r\nmay very likely be the Arum Virginianum. Compare with this account,\r\nwhat shall be related in the sequel of the Tahim and Tuckah.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I again returned to town.\r\n\r\nNovember the 8th. Several English and Swedish oeconomists kept\r\nbee-hives, which afforded their possessors profit: for bees succeed\r\nvery well here: the wax was for the most part sold to tradesmen: but\r\nthe honey they made use of in their own families, in different ways.\r\nThe people were unanimous, that the common bees were not in North\r\nAmerica before the arrival of the Europeans; but that they were first\r\nbrought over by the English who settled here. The Indians likewise\r\ngenerally declare, that their fathers had never seen any bees either in\r\nthe woods or any where else, before the Europeans had been several\r\nyears settled here. This is further confirmed by the name which the\r\nIndians give them: for having no particular name for them in their\r\nlanguage, they call them English flies, because the English first\r\nbrought them over: but at present they fly plentifully about the woods\r\nof North America. However it has been observed that the bees always\r\nwhen they swarm, spread to the southward, and never to the northward.\r\nIt seems as if they do not find the latter countries so good for their\r\nconstitution: therefore they cannot stay in Canada, and all that have\r\nbeen carried over thither, died in winter. It seemed to me as if the\r\nbees in America were somewhat smaller than ours in Sweden. They have\r\nnot yet been found in the woods on the other side of the Blue\r\nMountains, which confirms the opinion of their being brought to America\r\nof late. A man told Mr. Bartram, that on his travels in the woods of\r\nNorth America, he had found another sort of bees, which, instead of\r\nseparating their wax and honey, mixed it both together in a great bag.\r\nBut this account wants both clearing up and confirming.\r\n\r\nNovember the 9th. All the old Swedes and Englishmen born in America\r\nwhom I ever questioned, asserted that there were not near so many birds\r\nfit for eating at present, as there used to be when they were children,\r\nand that their decrease was visible. They even said, that they had\r\nheard their fathers complain of this, in whose childhood the bays,\r\nrivers and brooks were quite covered with all sorts of water fowls such\r\nas wild geese, ducks, and the like. But at present there is sometimes\r\nnot a single bird upon them; about sixty or seventy years ago, a single\r\nperson could kill eighty ducks in a morning; but at present you\r\nfrequently wait in vain for a single one. A Swede above ninety years\r\nold, assured me that he had in his youth killed twenty-three ducks at a\r\nshot. This good luck no body is likely to have at present, as you are\r\nforced to ramble about for a whole day, without getting a sight of more\r\nthan three or four. Cranes [44] at that time came hither by hundreds in\r\nthe spring: at present there are but very few. The wild Turkeys, and\r\nthe birds which the Swedes in this country call Partridges and\r\nHazel-hens were in whole flocks in the woods. But at this time a person\r\nis tired with walking before he can start a single bird.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this diminution is not difficult to find. Before the\r\narrival of the Europeans, the country was uncultivated, and full of\r\ngreat forests. The few Indians that lived here seldom disturbed the\r\nbirds. They carried on no trade among themselves, iron and gun powder\r\nwere unknown to them. One hundredth part of the fowl which at that time\r\nwere so plentiful here, would have sufficed to feed the few\r\ninhabitants; and considering that they cultivated their small maize\r\nfields, caught fish, hunted stags, beavers, bears, wild cattle, and\r\nother animals whose flesh was delicious to them, it will soon appear\r\nhow little they disturbed the birds. But since the arrival of great\r\ncrouds of Europeans, things are greatly changed; the country is well\r\npeopled, and the woods are cut down: the people increasing in this\r\ncountry, they have by hunting and shooting in part extirpated the\r\nbirds, in part scared them away: in spring the people still take both\r\neggs, mothers and young indifferently, because no regulations are made\r\nto the contrary. And if any had been made, the spirit of freedom which\r\nprevails in the country would not suffer them to be obeyed. But though\r\nthe eatable birds have been diminished greatly, yet there are others,\r\nwhich have rather increased than decreased in number, since the arrival\r\nof the Europeans: this can most properly be said of a species of daws\r\nwhich the English call Blackbirds [45] and the Swedes Maize thieves,\r\nDr. Linnæus calls them Gracula Quiscula. And together with them, the\r\nseveral sorts of Squirrels among the quadrupeds have spread: for these\r\nand the former, live chiefly upon maize, or at least they are most\r\ngreedy of it. But as population increases, the cultivation of maize\r\nincreases, and of course the food of the above-mentioned animals is\r\nmore plentiful: to this it is to be added, that these latter are rarely\r\neaten, and therefore they are more at liberty to multiply their kind.\r\nThere are likewise other birds which are not eaten, of which at present\r\nthere are nearly as many as there were before the arrival of the\r\nEuropeans. On the other hand I heard great complaints of the great\r\ndecrease of eatable fowl, not only in this province, but in all the\r\nparts of North America, where I have been.\r\n\r\nAged people had experienced that with the fish, which I have just\r\nmentioned of the birds: in their youth, the bays, rivers, and brooks,\r\nhad such quantities of fish that at one draught in the morning, they\r\ncaught as many as a horse was able to carry home. But at present things\r\nare greatly altered; and they often work in vain all the night long,\r\nwith all their fishing tackle. The causes of this decrease of fish, are\r\npartly the same with those of the diminution of the number of birds;\r\nbeing of late caught by a greater variety of contrivances, and in\r\ndifferent manners than before. The numerous mills on the rivers and\r\nbrooks likewise contribute to it in part: for it has been observed\r\nhere, that the fish go up the river in order to spawn in a shallow\r\nwater; but when they meet with works that prevent their proceeding,\r\nthey turn back, and never come again. Of this I was assured by a man of\r\nfortune at Boston: his father was used to catch a number of herrings\r\nthroughout the winter and almost always in summer, in a river, upon his\r\ncountry seat: but he having built a mill with a dyke in this water,\r\nthey were lost. In this manner they complained here and every where of\r\nthe decrease of fish. Old people asserted the same in regard to oysters\r\nat New York; for though they are still taken in considerable quantity,\r\nand are as big and as delicious as can be wished, yet all the\r\noyster-catchers own, that the number diminishes greatly every year: the\r\nmost natural cause of it, is probably the immoderate catching of them\r\nat all times of the year.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin told me that in that part of New England, where his father\r\nlived, two rivers fell into the sea, in one of which, they caught great\r\nnumbers of herring, and in the other not one. Yet the places where\r\nthese rivers discharged themselves into the sea, were not far asunder.\r\nThey had observed that when the herrings came in spring to deposit\r\ntheir spawn, they always swam up the river where they used to catch\r\nthem, but never came into the other. This circumstance led Mr.\r\nFranklin’s father who was settled between the two rivers, to try\r\nwhether it was not possible to make the herrings likewise live in the\r\nother river. For that purpose he put out his nets, as they were coming\r\nup for spawning, and he caught some. He took the spawn out of them, and\r\ncarefully carried it across the land into the other river. It was\r\nhatched, and the consequence was, that every year afterwards they\r\ncaught more herrings in that river; and this is still the case. This\r\nleads one to believe that the fish always like to spawn in the same\r\nplace where they were hatched, and from whence they first put out to\r\nsea; being as it were accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nThe following is another peculiar observation. It has never formerly\r\nbeen known that codfish were to be caught at cape Hinlopen: they were\r\nalways caught at the mouth of the Delaware: but at present they are\r\nnumerous in the former place. From hence it may be concluded that fish\r\nlikewise change their places of abode, of their own accord.\r\n\r\nA captain of a ship who had been in Greenland, asserted from his own\r\nexperience, that on passing the seventieth deg. of north lat. the\r\nsummer heat was there much greater, than it is below that degree. From\r\nhence he concluded, that the summer heat at the pole itself, must be\r\nstill more excessive, since the sun shines there for such a long space\r\nof time, without ever setting. The same account with similar\r\nconsequences drawn from thence, Mr. Franklin had heard of the ship\r\ncaptains in Boston, who had sailed to the most northern parts of this\r\nhemisphere. But still more astonishing is the account he got from\r\ncaptain Henry Atkins, who still lives at Boston. He had for some time\r\nbeen upon the fishery along the coasts of New England. But not catching\r\nas much as he wished, he sailed north, as far as Greenland. At last he\r\nwent so far, that he discovered people, who had never seen Europeans\r\nbefore (and what is more astonishing) who had no idea of the use of\r\nfire, which they had never employed; and if they had known it, they\r\ncould have made no use of their knowledge, as there were no trees in\r\nthe country. But they eat the birds and fish which they caught quite\r\nraw. Captain Atkins got some very scarce skins in exchange for some\r\ntrifles.\r\n\r\nIt is already known from several accounts of voyages, that to the\r\nnorthward neither trees nor bushes, nor any ligneous plants are to be\r\nmet with, fit for burning. But is it not probable that the inhabitants\r\nof so desolate a country, like other northern nations which we know,\r\nburn the train oil of fishes, and the fat of animals in lamps, in order\r\nto boil their meat, to warm their subterraneous caves in winter, and to\r\nlight them in the darkest season of the year? else their darkness would\r\nbe insupportable.\r\n\r\nNovember the 11th. In several writings we read of a large animal, which\r\nis to be met with in New England and other parts of North America. They\r\nsometimes dig very long and branched horns out of the ground in\r\nIreland, and no body in that country or any where else in the world,\r\nknows an animal that has such horns. This has induced many people to\r\nbelieve that it is the Moose-deer so famous in North America, and that\r\nthe horns found, were of animals of this kind, which had formerly lived\r\nin that island, but were gradually destroyed. It has even been\r\nconcluded, that Ireland, in distant ages either was connected with\r\nNorth America, or that a number of little islands, which are lost at\r\npresent, made a chain between them. This led me to enquire, whether an\r\nanimal with such excessive great horns, as are ascribed to the\r\nMoose-deer, had ever been seen in any part of this country. Mr. Bartram\r\ntold me, that notwithstanding he had carefully enquired to that\r\npurpose, yet there was no person who could give him any information,\r\nwhich could be relied upon, and therefore he was entirely of opinion,\r\nthat there was no such an animal in North America. Mr. Franklin related\r\nthat he had, when a boy, seen two of the animals which they call\r\nMoose-deer, but he well remembered that they were not near of such a\r\nsize as they must have been, if the horns found in Ireland were to fit\r\nthem: the two animals which he saw, were brought to Boston in order to\r\nbe sent to England to Queen Ann. The height of the animal up to the\r\nback was that of a pretty tall horse; but the head and its horns were\r\nstill higher: Mr. Dudley has given a description of the Moose-deer\r\nwhich is found in North America. On my travels in Canada, I often\r\nenquired of the Frenchmen, whether there had ever been seen so large an\r\nanimal in this country, as some people say there is in North America;\r\nand with such great horns as are sometimes dug out in Ireland. But I\r\nwas always told, that they had never heard of it, and much less seen\r\nit: some added, that if there was such an animal, they certainly must\r\nhave met with it, in some of their excursions in the woods. There are\r\nelks here, which are either of the same sort with the Swedish ones, or\r\na variety of them: of these they often catch some which are larger than\r\ncommon, whence perhaps the report of the very large animal with\r\nexcessive horns in North America first had its rise. These elks are\r\ncalled Original’s by the French in Canada, which name they have\r\nborrowed from the Indians: perhaps Dudley, in describing the\r\nMoose-deer, meant no other animals, than these large elks. [46]\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin gave me a piece of a stone, which on account of its\r\nindestructibility in the fire, is made use of in New England for making\r\nmelting furnaces and forges.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a mixture of Lapis Ollaris or Serpentine stone, and of\r\nAsbest. The greatest part of it is a grey Serpentine stone, which is\r\nfat and smooth to the touch, and is easily cut and worked. Here and\r\nthere are some glittering speckles of that sort of asbest, whose fibres\r\ncome from a center like rays, or Star Asbest. This stone is not found\r\nin strata or solid rocks, but here and there scattered on the fields.\r\n\r\nAnother stone is called Soapstone by many of the Swedes, being as\r\nsmooth as soap on the outside. They make use of it for rubbing spots\r\nout of their cloaths. It might be called Saxum talcosum particulus\r\nspataceis, granatisque immixtis, or a talc with mixed particles of spar\r\nand garnets. A more exact description I reserve for another work. At\r\npresent I only add that the ground colour is pale green, with some dark\r\nspots, and sometimes a few of a greenish hue. It is very smooth to the\r\ntouch, and runs always waved. It is likewise easily sawed and cut,\r\nthough it is not very smooth. I have seen large stones of it, which\r\nwere a fathom and more long, proportionably broad, and commonly six\r\ninches or a foot deep. But I cannot determine any thing of their\r\noriginal size, as I have not been at the place where they are dug, and\r\nhave only seen the stones at Philadelphia, which are brought there\r\nready cut. The particles of talc in this stone are about thirty times\r\nas many as those of spar and garnet. It is found in many parts of the\r\ncountry, for example in the neighbourhood of Chester in Pennsylvania.\r\nThe English likewise call it Soapstone, [47] and it is likely that the\r\nSwedes have borrowed that name from them.\r\n\r\nThis stone was chiefly employed in the following manner. First, the\r\npeople took spots out of their cloaths with it. But for this purpose\r\nthe whole stone is not equally useful, for it includes in its clear\r\nparticles some dark ones which consist wholly of serpentine stone, and\r\nmay easily be cut with a knife; some of the loose stone is scraped off\r\nlike a powder, and strewed upon a greasy spot, in silk or any other\r\nfluff; this imbibes the grease, and after rubbing off the powder the\r\nspot disappears: and as this stone is likewise very durable in the\r\nfire, the country people make their hearths with it, especially the\r\nplace where the fire lies, and where the heat is the greatest, for the\r\nstone stands the strongest fire. If the people can get a sufficient\r\nquantity of this stone, they lay the steps before the houses with it,\r\ninstead of bricks, which are generally used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe walls round the court yards, gardens, burying places, and those for\r\nthe sloping cellar doors towards the street, which are all commonly\r\nbuilt of brick, are covered with a coping of this stone; for it holds\r\nexcellently against all the effects of the sun, air, rain and storm,\r\nand does not decay but secures the bricks. On account of this quality,\r\npeople commonly get the door posts in which their hinges are fastened\r\nmade of this stone: and in several publick buildings, such as the house\r\nof assembly for the province, the whole lower wall is built of it, and\r\nin other houses the corners are laid out with it.\r\n\r\nThe Salt which is used in the English North American colonies is\r\nbrought from the West Indies. The Indians have in some places salt\r\nsprings from which they get salt by boiling. I shall in the sequel have\r\noccasion to describe some of them. Mr. Franklin was of opinion that the\r\npeople in Pensylvania could easier make good salt of sea water, than in\r\nNew England, where sometimes salt is made of the sea water on their\r\ncoast; though their situation is more northerly. Lead-ore has been\r\ndiscovered in Pensylvania, but as it is not to be met with in quantity,\r\nno body ever attempted to use it. Loadstones of considerable goodness\r\nhave likewise been found; and I myself possess several pretty pieces of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIron is dug in such great quantities in Pensylvania and in the other\r\nAmerican provinces of the English, that they could provide with that\r\ncommodity not only England, but almost all Europe, and perhaps the\r\ngreater part of the globe. The ore is here commonly infinitely easier\r\ngot in the mines, than our Swedish ore. For in many places with a pick\r\nax, a crow-foot and a wooden club, it is got with the same ease with\r\nwhich a hole can be made in a hard soil: in many places the people know\r\nnothing of boring, blasting and firing; and the ore is likewise very\r\nfusible. Of this iron they get such quantities, that not only the\r\nnumerous inhabitants of the colonies themselves have enough of it, but\r\ngreat quantities, are sent to the West Indies, and they have lately\r\nbegan even to trade to Europe with it. This iron is reckoned better for\r\nship building than our Swedish iron, or any other, because salt water\r\ndoes not corrode it so much. Some people believed that without\r\nreckoning the freight, they could sell their iron in England at a lower\r\nrate than any other nation; especially when the country becomes better\r\npeopled and labour cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe mountain flax, [48] or that kind of stone, which Bishop Browallius\r\ncalls Amiantus fibris separabilibus molliusculis, in his lectures on\r\nmineralogy which were published in 1739, or the amiant with soft fibres\r\nwhich can easily be separated, is found abundantly in Pensylvania. Some\r\npieces are very soft, others pretty tough: Mr. Franklin told me that\r\ntwenty and some odd years ago, when he made a voyage to England, he had\r\na little purse with him, made of the mountain flax of this country,\r\nwhich he presented to Sir Hans Sloane. I have likewise seen paper made\r\nof this stone: and I have likewise received some small pieces of it,\r\nwhich I keep in my cabinet. Mr. Franklin had been told by others that\r\non exposing this mountain flax to the open air in winter, and leaving\r\nit in the cold and wet, it would grow together, and more fit for\r\nspinning. But he did not venture to determine how far this opinion was\r\ngrounded. On this occasion he related a very pleasant accident, which\r\nhappened to him with this mountain flax: he had, several years ago, got\r\na piece of it, which he gave to one of his journeymen printers, in\r\norder to get it made into a sheet at the paper mill. As soon as the\r\nfellow brought the paper, Mr. Franklin rolled it up, and threw it into\r\nthe fire, telling the journeyman he would see a miracle, a sheet of\r\npaper which did not burn: the ignorant fellow asserted the contrary,\r\nbut was greatly astonished, upon seeing himself convinced. Mr. Franklin\r\nthen explained him, though not very clearly, the peculiar qualities of\r\nthe paper. As soon as he was gone, some of his acquaintance came in,\r\nwho immediately knew the paper. The journeyman thought he would shew\r\nthem a great curiosity and astonish them. He accordingly told them that\r\nhe had curiously made a sheet of paper, which would not burn, though it\r\nwas thrown into the fire. They pretended to think it impossible, and he\r\nas strenuously maintained his assertion. At last they laid a wager\r\nabout it; but whilst he was busy with stirring up the fire, the others\r\nslyly besmeared the paper with fat: the journeyman, who was not aware\r\nof it, threw it into the fire, and that moment it was all in flames:\r\nthis astonished him so much, that he was almost speechless; upon which\r\nthey could not help laughing, and so discovered the whole artifice.\r\n\r\nIn several houses of the town, a number of little Ants run about,\r\nliving underground and in holes in the wall. The length of their bodies\r\nis one geometrical line. Their colour is either black or dark red: they\r\nhave the custom of carrying off sweet things, if they can come at them,\r\nin common with the ants of other countries. Mr. Franklin was much\r\ninclined to believe that these little insects could by some means\r\ncommunicate their thoughts or desires to each other, and he confirmed\r\nhis opinion by some examples. When an ant finds some sugar, it runs\r\nimmediately under ground to its hole, where having stayed a little\r\nwhile, a whole army comes out, unites and marches to the place where\r\nthe sugar is, and carries it off by pieces: or if an ant meets with a\r\ndead fly, which it cannot carry alone, it immediately hastens home, and\r\nsoon after some more come out, creep to the fly and carry it away. Some\r\ntime ago Mr. Franklin put a little earthen pot with treacle into a\r\ncloset. A number of ants got into the pot, and devoured the treacle\r\nvery quietly. But as he observed it he shook them out, and tied the pot\r\nwith a thin string to a nail which he had fastened in the ceiling; so\r\nthat the pot hung down by the string. A single ant by chance remained\r\nin the pot: this ant eat till it was satisfied; but when it wanted to\r\nget off, it was under great concern to find its way out: it ran about\r\nthe bottom of the pot, but in vain: at last it found after many\r\nattempts the way to get to the ceiling by the string. After it was come\r\nthere, it ran to the wall, and from thence to the ground. It had hardly\r\nbeen away for half an hour, when a great swarm of ants came out, got up\r\nto the ceiling, and crept along the string into the pot, and began to\r\neat again: this they continued till the treacle was all eaten: in the\r\nmean time one swarm running down the string, and the other up.\r\n\r\nNovember the 12th. A man of fortune who has long been in this province\r\nasserted, that, by twenty years experience, he had found a confirmation\r\nof what other people have observed with regard to the weather, viz.\r\nthat the weather in winter was commonly foretold by that on the first\r\nof November, old stile, or twelfth new stile; if that whole day be\r\nfair, the next winter will bring but little rain and snow along with\r\nit: but if the first half of the day be clear, and the other cloudy,\r\nthe beginning of winter would accordingly be fair, but its end and\r\nspring would turn out rigorous and disagreeable: of the same kind were\r\nthe other presages. I have likewise in other places heard of similar\r\nsigns of the weather; but as a mature judgment greatly lessens the\r\nconfidence in them, so the meteorological observations have\r\nsufficiently shewn, how infinitely often these prophecies have failed.\r\n\r\nPensylvania abounds in springs, and you commonly meet with a spring of\r\nclear water on one or the other, and sometimes on several sides of a\r\nmountain. The people near such springs, use them for every purpose of a\r\nfine spring water. They also conduct the water into a little stone\r\nbuilding near the house, where they can confine it, and bring fresh\r\nsupplies at pleasure. In summer they place their milk, bottles of wine\r\nand other liquors in this building, where they keep cool and fresh. In\r\nmany country houses, the kitchen or buttery was so situated, that a\r\nrivulet ran under it, and had the water near at hand.\r\n\r\nNot only people of fortune, but even others that had some possessions,\r\ncommonly had fish ponds in the country near their houses. They always\r\ntook care that fresh water might run into their ponds, which is very\r\nsalutary for the fish: for that purpose the ponds were placed near a\r\nspring on a hill.\r\n\r\nNovember the 13th. I saw in several parts of this province a ready\r\nmethod of getting plenty of grass to grow in the meadows. Here must be\r\nremembered what I have before mentioned about the springs, which are\r\nsometimes found on the sides of hills and sometimes in vallies. The\r\nmeadows lie commonly in the vallies between the hills: if they are too\r\nswampy and wet, the water is carried off by several ditches. But the\r\nsummer in Pensylvania is very hot; and the sun often burns the grass so\r\nmuch, that it dries up entirely. The husbandmen therefore have been\r\nvery attentive to prevent this in their meadows: to that purpose they\r\nlook for all the springs in the neighbourhood of a meadow; and as the\r\nrivulets flowed before by the shortest way into the vallies, they raise\r\nthe water as much as possible and necessary, to the higher part of the\r\nmeadow, and make several narrow channels from the brook, down into the\r\nplain, so that it is entirely watered by it. When there are some deeper\r\nplaces, they frequently lay wooden gutters across them, through which\r\nthe water flows to the other side; and from thence it is again by very\r\nnarrow channels carried to all the places where it seems necessary. To\r\nraise the water the higher, and in order to spread it more, there are\r\nhigh dykes built near the springs, between which the water rises till\r\nit is so high as to run down where the people want it. Industry and\r\ningenuity went further: when a brook runs in a wood, with a direction\r\nnot towards the meadow, and it has been found by levelling, and taking\r\nan exact survey of the land between the meadow and the rivulet, that\r\nthe latter can be conducted towards the former; a dyke is made, which\r\nhems the course of the brook, and the water is led round the meadow\r\nover many hills, sometimes for the space of an English mile and\r\nfurther, partly across vallies in wooden pipes, till at last it is\r\nbrought where it is wanted, and where it can be spread as\r\nabove-mentioned. One that has not seen it himself, cannot believe how\r\ngreat a quantity of grass there is in such meadows, especially near the\r\nlittle channels; whilst others, which have not been thus managed look\r\nwretchedly. The meadows commonly lie in the vallies, and one or more of\r\ntheir sides have a declivity. The water can therefore easily be brought\r\nto run down in them. These meadows which are so carefully watered, are\r\ncommonly mowed three times every summer. But it is likewise to be\r\nobserved, that summer continues seven months here. The inhabitants\r\nseldom fail to employ a brook or spring in this manner, if it is not\r\ntoo far from the meadows to be led to them.\r\n\r\nThe leaves were at present fallen from all the trees; both from oaks,\r\nand from all those which have deciduous leaves, and they covered the\r\nground in the woods six inches deep. The great quantity of leaves which\r\ndrop annually, would necessarily seem to encrease the upper black mould\r\ngreatly. However, it is not above three or four inches thick in the\r\nwoods, and under it lays a brick coloured clay, mixed with a sand of\r\nthe same colour. It is remarkable, that a soil which in all probability\r\nhas not been stirred, should be covered with so little black mould: but\r\nI shall speak of this in the sequel.\r\n\r\nNovember the 14th. The Squirrels which run about plentifully in the\r\nwoods are of different species; I here intend to describe the most\r\ncommon sorts, more accurately.\r\n\r\nThe grey Squirrels are very plentiful in Pensylvania and in the other\r\nprovinces of North America. Their shape corresponds with that of our\r\nSwedish squirrel; but they differ from them, by keeping their grey\r\ncolour all the year long, and in size being something bigger. The woods\r\nin all these provinces, and chiefly in Pensylvania, consist of trees\r\nwith deciduous leaves, and in such these squirrels like to live. Ray in\r\nhis Synopsis Quadrupedum, p. 215, and Catesby in his Natural History of\r\nCarolina, Vol. 2. p. 74, tab. 74, call it the Virginian greater grey\r\nSquirrel; and the latter has added a figure after life. The Swedes call\r\nit grao Ickorn, which is the same as the English grey Squirrel. Their\r\nnests are commonly in hollow trees, and are made of moss, straw, and\r\nother soft things: their food is chiefly nuts; as hazel nuts,\r\nchinquapins, chesnuts, walnuts, hiccory nuts, and the acorns of the\r\ndifferent sorts of oak which grow here; but maize is what they are most\r\ngreedy of. The ground in the woods is in autumn covered with acorns,\r\nand all kinds of nuts which drop from the numerous trees: of these the\r\nsquirrels gather great stores for winter, which they lay up in holes\r\ndug by them for that purpose: they likewise carry a great quantity of\r\nthem into their nests.\r\n\r\nAs soon as winter comes, the snow and cold confines them to their holes\r\nfor several days, especially when the weather is very rough. During\r\nthis time they consume the little store, which they have brought to\r\ntheir nests: as soon therefore as the weather grows milder, they creep\r\nout, and dig out part of the store which they have laid up in the\r\nground: of this they eat some on the spot, and carry the rest into\r\ntheir nests on the trees. We frequently observed that in winter, at the\r\neve of a great frost, when there had been some temperate weather, the\r\nsquirrels, a day or two before the frost, ran about the woods in\r\ngreater numbers than common, partly in order to eat their fill, and\r\npartly to store their nests with a new provision for the ensuing great\r\ncold, during which they did not venture to come out, but stay snug in\r\ntheir nests: therefore seeing them run in the woods in greater numbers\r\nthan ordinary, was a safe prognostic of an ensuing cold.\r\n\r\nThe hogs which are here droven into the woods, whilst there is yet no\r\nsnow in them, often do considerable damage to the poor squirrels, by\r\nrooting up their store-holes, and robbing their winter provisions. Both\r\nthe Indians, and the European Americans, take great pains to find out\r\nthese store-holes, whether in trees or in the ground, as all the nuts\r\nthey contain are choice, and not only quite ripe, but likewise not\r\npierced by worms. The nuts and acorns which the Dormice, or Mus\r\nCricetus, Linn. store up in autumn, are all in the same condition. The\r\nSwedes relate, that in the long winter, which happened here in the year\r\n1741, there fell such a quantity of snow, that the squirrels could not\r\nget to their store, and many of them were starved to death.\r\n\r\nThe damage which these animals do in the maize fields, I have already\r\ndescribed: they do the more harm, as they do not eat all the corn, but\r\nonly the inner and sweet part, and as it were take off the husks. In\r\nspring towards the end of April, when the oaks were in full flower, I\r\nonce observed a number of squirrels on them, sometimes five, six, or\r\nmore in a tree, who bit off the flower stalks a little below the\r\nflowers, and dropt them on the ground: whether they eat any thing off\r\nthem, or made use of them for some other purpose I know not: but the\r\nground was quite covered with oak flowers, to which part of the stalk\r\nadhered. For this reason the oaks do not bear so much fruit by far, to\r\nfeed hogs and other animals, as they would otherwise do.\r\n\r\nOf all the wild animals in this country, the squirrels are some of the\r\neasiest to tame, especially when they are taken young for that purpose.\r\nI have seen them tamed so far, that they would follow the boys into the\r\nwoods and run about every where, and when tired would sit on their\r\nshoulders. Sometimes they only ran a little way into the wood, and then\r\nreturned home again to the little hole that had been fitted up for\r\nthem. When they eat, they sit almost upright, hold their food between\r\ntheir forefeet and their tail bent upwards. When the tame ones got more\r\nthan they could eat at a time, they carried the remainder to their\r\nhabitations, and hid it amongst the wool which they lay upon. Such tame\r\nsquirrels shewed no fear of strangers, and would suffer themselves to\r\nbe touched by every body, without offering to bite. They sometimes\r\nwould leap upon stranger’s cloaths and lie still on them, in order to\r\nsleep. In the farm houses where they were kept, they played with cats\r\nand dogs: they likewise eat bread.\r\n\r\nThe wild grey squirrels likewise hold up their tails when sitting. As\r\nsoon as they perceive a man, they continually wag their tails and begin\r\nto gnash with their teeth, and make a great noise, which they do not\r\nreadily give over. Those who go a shooting birds and other animals, are\r\ntherefore very angry at them, as this noise discovers them, and alarms\r\nthe game. Though a grey squirrel does not seem to be very shy, yet it\r\nis very difficult to kill; for when it perceives a man, it climbs upon\r\na tree, and commonly chuses the highest about it. It then tries to hide\r\nitself behind the trunk, so that the shooter may not see it, and though\r\nhe goes ever so fast round the tree, yet the squirrel changes its place\r\nas quickly, if not quicker: if two boughs bend towards each other, the\r\nsquirrel lies in the middle of them, and presses itself so close, that\r\nit is hardly visible. You may then shake the tree, throw sticks and\r\nstones to the place where it lies, or shoot at it, yet it will never\r\nstir. If three branches join, it takes refuge between them, and lies as\r\nclose to them as possible, and then it is sufficiently safe. Sometimes\r\nit escapes on a tree where there are old nests of squirrels, or of\r\nlarge birds: it slips into such, and cannot be got out, either by\r\nshooting, throwing, or any thing else; for the grey squirrels seldom\r\nleap from one tree to another, except extreme danger compels them. They\r\ncommonly run directly up the trees and down the same way, with their\r\nhead straight forward. Several of them which I shot in the woods, had\r\ngreat numbers of fleas.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that these squirrels are among the animals,\r\nwhich at present are more plentiful than they formerly were, and that\r\nthe infinitely greater cultivation of maize, which is their favourite\r\nfood, is the cause of their multiplication. However it is peculiar,\r\nthat in some years a greater number of squirrels come down from the\r\nhigher countries into Pensylvania, and other English colonies. They\r\ncommonly come in autumn, and are then very busy in the woods gathering\r\nnuts and acorns, which they carry into hollow trees or their\r\nstore-holes, in order to be sufficiently provided with food for winter.\r\nThey are so diligent in storing up of provisions, that though the nuts\r\nhave been extremely plentiful that year, yet it is difficult to get a\r\nconsiderable quantity of them. The people here pretended from their own\r\nexperience to know, that when the squirrels came down in such numbers\r\nfrom the higher parts of the country, the winter ensuing was uncommonly\r\nrigorous and cold, and for that reason they always look upon their\r\ncoming down, as a sure sign of such a winter. Yet this does not always\r\nprove true, as I experienced in the autumn of the year 1749: at that\r\ntime a great number of squirrels came down into the colonies, yet the\r\nwinter was very mild and no colder than common. But it appeared that\r\ntheir migration was occasioned by the scarcity of nuts and acorns,\r\nwhich happened that year in the higher parts of the country, and\r\nobliged them to come hither for their food. Therefore they generally\r\nreturn the next year to the place from which they came.\r\n\r\nSome people reckon squirrel flesh a great dainty, but the generality\r\nmake no account of it. The skin is good for little, yet small straps\r\nare sometimes made of it, as it is very tough: others use it as a furr\r\nlining, for want of a better. Ladies shoes are likewise sometimes made\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe Rattle snake often devours the squirrels, notwithstanding all their\r\nagility. This unwieldy creature, is said to catch so agile an one,\r\nmerely by fascination. I have never had an opportunity of seeing how it\r\nis done: but so many credible people assured me of the truth of the\r\nfact, and asserted that they were present, and paid peculiar attention\r\nto it, that I am almost forced to believe their unanimous accounts. The\r\nfascination is effected in the following manner: the snake lies at the\r\nbottom of the tree upon which the squirrel sits; its eyes are fixed\r\nupon the little animal, and from that moment it cannot escape; it\r\nbegins a doleful outcry, which is so well known, that a person passing\r\nby, on hearing it, immediately knows that it is charmed by a snake. The\r\nsquirrel runs up the tree a little way, comes downwards again, then\r\ngoes up, and now comes lower again. On that occasion it has been\r\nobserved, that the squirrel always goes down more than it goes up. The\r\nsnake still continues at the root of the tree, with its eyes fixed on\r\nthe squirrel, with which its attention is so entirely taken up, that a\r\nperson accidentally approaching, may make a considerable noise, without\r\nthe snake’s so much as turning about. The squirrel as before-mentioned\r\ncomes always lower, and at last leaps down to the snake, whose mouth is\r\nalready wide open for its reception. The poor little animal then with a\r\npiteous cry runs into the snake’s jaws, and is swallowed at once, if it\r\nbe not too big; but if its size will not allow it to be swallowed at\r\nonce, the snake licks it several times with its tongue, and smoothens\r\nit, and by that means makes it fit for swallowing. Every thing else\r\nremarkable at this enchantment, I have described in a treatise inserted\r\nin the Memoirs of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in the Volume\r\nfor the year 1753, I therefore am not so circumstantial here. The same\r\npower of enchanting is ascribed to that kind of snake, which is\r\ncommonly called the black snake in America, and it is said to catch and\r\ndevour squirrels in the same manner as the former. [49]\r\n\r\nBut these little animals do considerable damage to the maize, not only\r\nwhilst it is upon the stalk, as I have before observed, but even when\r\nit is brought home into the barns: for if they can come at it without\r\nany obstacle, they can in a few nights bring a whole bushel away into\r\ntheir lurking holes. The government in most of the North American\r\ncolonies, has therefore been obliged to offer a certain premium, to be\r\npaid out of the common treasury, for the head of a squirrel. It seems\r\ninconceivable what a sum of money has been paid for grey and black\r\nsquirrel’s heads, in the province of Pensylvania only, from the first\r\nof January 1749, to the first of January 1750; for when the deputies\r\nfrom the several districts of the province met, in order to deliberate\r\nupon the affairs of the province, each of them complained that their\r\ntreasuries were exhausted by paying so much for squirrels: for at that\r\ntime the law had appointed a reward of three-pence for each squirrel’s\r\nhead. So far extended the vengeance taken upon these little creatures,\r\ni.e. upon the grey and black squirrels. It was found, by calling up\r\naccounts, that in that one year eight thousand pounds of Pensylvania\r\ncurrency, had been expended in paying these rewards: this I was assured\r\nof by a man who had looked over the accounts himself.\r\n\r\nMany people, especially young men, left all other employment, and went\r\ninto the woods to shoot squirrels: but the government having\r\nexperienced how much three-pence per head took out of the treasury,\r\nsettled half that sum upon each squirrel’s head.\r\n\r\nFlying Squirrels are a peculiar kind, which seem to be the same with\r\nthose which inhabit Finland, and which Dr. Linnæus in his Fauna\r\nSvecica, No. 38. calls Sciurus volans. The American flying squirrel at\r\nthe utmost is only a variety of that which we have in Finland. Catesby\r\nin his Natural History of Carolina, Vol. 2, p. 76, 77, has described\r\nit, and tab. 76, 77, drawn it after life. He likewise calls it Sciurus\r\nvolans. Edwards in his Natural History of Birds represents it, t. 191.\r\nThey are met with in the woods, but not very frequently. They are\r\nscarce ever seen in the day time, unless they are forced out by men who\r\nhave discovered their nests: for they sleep in the day time, but as\r\nsoon as it grows dark, they come out and run about almost all night.\r\nThey live in hollow trees, and by cutting one down, seven or more\r\nflying squirrels are frequently found in it. By the additional skin\r\nwith which Providence has provided them on both sides, they can fly\r\nfrom one tree to another. They expand their skins like wings, and\r\ncontract them again as soon as they can get hold of the opposite tree.\r\nSome people say that they fly in a horizontal line; but others asserted\r\nthat they first went a little downwards, and then rose up again, when\r\nthey approached the tree to which they would fly: they cannot fly\r\nfurther than four or five fathoms. Among all the squirrels in this\r\ncountry, these are the most easily tamed. The boys carry them to\r\nschool, or wherever they go, without their ever attempting to escape:\r\nif even they put their squirrel aside, it leaps upon them again\r\nimmediately, creeps either into their bosom, or their sleeve, or any\r\nfold of the clothes, and lies down to sleep: its food is the same with\r\nthat of the grey squirrel.\r\n\r\nThere is a small species of squirrels abounding in the woods, which the\r\nEnglish call ground Squirrels. Catesby has described and drawn them\r\nfrom life, in the 2d. Vol. of his Natural History of Carolina, p. 75,\r\ntab. 75, and Edwards in his Natural History of Birds, t. 181. [50] He\r\nand Dr. Linnæus call it Sciurus striatus, or the streaked Squirrel.\r\nThese do not properly live in trees, as others of this genus, but dig\r\nholes in the ground (much in the same manner as rabbets) in which they\r\nlive, and whither they take refuge when they perceive any danger. Their\r\nholes go deep, and commonly further inwards divide into many branches.\r\nThey are also cunning enough to make sometimes an opening or hole to\r\nthe surface of the ground from one of these branches. The advantage\r\nthey have from hence, is that when they stroll about for food, and the\r\nhole is stopt up through which they went out, they may not expose\r\nthemselves to be caught, but presently find the other hole, into which\r\nthey may retreat: but in autumn, when the leaves fall from the trees,\r\nor sometime after, it is diversion to see the consternation they are\r\nsometimes in when pursued; for their holes being easily covered with\r\nthe great fall of leaves, or by the wind, they have a great deal to do,\r\nto find them on a sudden: they then run backwards and forwards, as if\r\nthey had lost their way: they seem to know the places where they have\r\nmade their subterraneous walks, but cannot conceive where the entrances\r\nare. If they be then pursued, and one claps his hands, they know no\r\nother refuge than that of climbing upon a tree; for it is to be\r\nobserved that these squirrels always live under ground, and never climb\r\nupon trees unless pursued, and unable in the hurry to find their holes.\r\nThis kind of squirrels is much more numerous in Pensylvania, than in\r\nany other province of North America through which I have travelled. Its\r\nlength is commonly six inches, without the curved tail; and it is very\r\nnarrow. The skin is ferruginous, or of a reddish brown, and marked with\r\nfive black streaks, one of which runs along the back, and two on each\r\nside. Their food consists of all sorts of corn, as rye, barley, wheat,\r\nmaize, and of acorns, nuts, &c. They gather their winter provisions in\r\nautumn, like the common grey squirrels, and keep them in their holes\r\nunder ground. If they get into a granary, they do as much mischief as\r\nmice and rats. It has often been observed that if, after eating rye,\r\nthey come to some wheat, they throw up the former, which they do not\r\nlike so well as the wheat, in order to fill their belly with the\r\nlatter. When the maize is reaped in the fields, they are very busy in\r\nbiting off the ears, and filling the pouches in their mouth with corn,\r\nso that their cheeks are quite blown up. With this booty they hasten\r\ninto the holes which they have made in the ground.\r\n\r\nAs a Swede was making a mill-dyke, pretty late in autumn, he employed\r\nfor that purpose the soil of a neighbouring hill, and met with a hole\r\non a subterraneous walk belonging to these squirrels; he followed it\r\nfor some time, and discovered a walk on one side like a branch, parting\r\nfrom the chief stem: it was near two feet long, and at its end was a\r\nquantity of choice acorns of the white oak, which the little careful\r\nanimal had stored up for winter. Soon after he found another walk on\r\nthe side like the former, but containing a fine store of maize: the\r\nnext had hiccory nuts, and the last and most hidden one contained some\r\nexcellent chesnuts, which might have filled two hats.\r\n\r\nIn winter these squirrels are seldom seen, for during that season they\r\nlive in their subterraneous holes upon the provisions, which they have\r\nstored up there. However on a very fine and clear day they sometimes\r\ncome out. They frequently dig through the ground, into cellars in which\r\nthe country people lay up their apples, which they partly eat, and\r\npartly spoil, so that the master has little or nothing left. They\r\nhandle the maize stores full as roughly as the apples. But the cats are\r\ntheir great enemies, who devour them and bring them home to their young\r\nones: their flesh is not eaten by men, and their skin is not made use\r\nof.\r\n\r\nOf all the squirrels in the country, these are the most difficult to be\r\ntamed; for, though they be caught very young, yet it is dangerous to\r\ntouch them with naked hands, as they bite very sharp when one is not\r\naware of them. Many boys, who had lost a deal of time in trying to tame\r\nthese squirrels, owned that they knew of no art to make them quite\r\ntame; at least they are never so far tamed as the other species. In\r\norder to do any thing towards taming them they must be caught when they\r\nare very small. Some people kept them in that state in a cage, because\r\nthey looked very pretty.\r\n\r\nI shall take an other opportunity of speaking of the black and\r\nferruginous squirrels, which likewise inhabit this country.\r\n\r\nNovember the 15th. In the morning I returned to Philadelphia. Mr. Cock\r\ntold me to day, and on some other occasions afterwards, an accident\r\nwhich happened to him, and which seemed greatly to confirm a peculiar\r\nsign of an imminent hurricane. He sailed to the West Indies in a small\r\nyacht, and had an old man on board, who had for a considerable time\r\nsailed in this sea. The old man sounding the depth, called to the mate\r\nto tell Mr. Cock to launch the boats immediately, and to put a\r\nsufficient number of men into them, in order to tow the yacht during\r\nthe calm, that they might reach the island before them, as soon as\r\npossible, as within twenty-four hours there would be a strong\r\nhurricane. Mr. Cock asked him what reasons he had to think so, the old\r\nman replied, that on sounding, he saw the lead in the water at a\r\ndistance of many fathoms more than he had seen it before; that\r\ntherefore the water was become clear all of a sudden, which he looked\r\nupon as a certain sign of an impending hurricane in the sea. Mr. Cock\r\nlikewise saw the excessive clearness of the water. He therefore gave\r\nimmediate orders for launching the boat, and towing the yacht, so that\r\nthey arrived before night in a safe harbour. But before they had quite\r\nreached it the waves began to rise more and more, and the water was as\r\nit were boiling, though no wind was perceptible. In the ensuing night\r\nthe hurricane came on, and raged with such violence, that not only many\r\nships were lost, and the roofs were torn off from the houses, but even\r\nMr. Cock’s yacht and other ships, though they were in safe harbours,\r\nwere by the wind, and the violence of the sea, washed so far on shore,\r\nthat several weeks elapsed, before they could be got off.\r\n\r\nAn old Dutch skipper said, that he had once caught a dogfish in the bay\r\nof New York, which being cut open, had a quantity of eels in his\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nNovember the 18th. Mr. Bartram shewed me an earthen pot, which had been\r\nfound in a place, where the Indians formerly lived. He, who first dug\r\nit out, kept grease and fat in it to smear his shoes, boots and all\r\nforts of leather with: Mr. Bartram bought the pot of that man; it was\r\nyet entire and not damaged: I could perceive no glaze or colour upon\r\nit, but on the outside it was very much ornamented and upon the whole\r\nwell made. Mr. Bartram shewed me several pieces of broken earthen\r\nvessels which the Indians formerly made use of. It plainly appeared in\r\nall these that they were not made of mere clay; but that different\r\nmaterials had been mixed with it, according to the nature of the places\r\nwhere they were made. Those Indians, for example, who lived near the\r\nsea shore, pounded the shells of snails and muscles, and mixed them\r\nwith the clay. Others who lived further up in the country, where\r\nmountain crystals could be found, pounded them and mixed them with\r\ntheir clay; but how they proceeded in making the vessels, is entirely\r\nunknown: it was plain, that they did not burn them much, for they were\r\nso soft that they might be cut in pieces with a knife: the workmanship\r\nhowever seems to have been very good; for at present they find whole\r\nvessels or pieces in the ground, which are not damaged at all, though\r\nthey have lain in the ground above a century. Before the Europeans\r\nsettled in North America, the Indians had no other vessels to boil\r\ntheir meat in, than these earthen pots of their own making: but since\r\ntheir arrival, they have always bought pots, kettles, and other\r\nnecessary vessels of the Europeans, and take no longer the pains of\r\nmaking some, by which means this art is entirely lost among them. Such\r\nvessels of their own construction are therefore a great rarity even\r\namong the Indians. I have seen such old pots and pieces of them,\r\nconsisting of a kind of Serpentine stone, or Linnæus’s Talcum, Syst.\r\nnat. 3. p. 52.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram likewise shewed me little pieces of a black slate, which is\r\nplentifully found in some parts of the river Skullkill. There are\r\npieces to be found, which are four feet and above square: the colour\r\nand configuration is the same as in the Table slate (Schistus\r\ntabularis, Linn.) Syst. nat. 3. p. 37. except that this is a little\r\nthicker. The inhabitants of the country thereabouts (in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Skullkill) cover their roofs with it; Mr. Bartram\r\nassured me, that he had seen a whole roof composed of four such slates.\r\nThe rays of the sun, heat, cold, and rain do not act upon the stone.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram further related, that in several parts of the country,\r\ncaves or holes were to be met with, going deep into the mountains: he\r\nhad been in several of them and had often found a number of\r\nStalactites, Linnæus’s Stalactites stillatitius, Syst. nat. 3. p. 183.\r\nof different dimensions at the top; they differed in colour, but the\r\ngreatest curiosity was, that in some of the caves Mr. Bartram had found\r\nStalactites, whose outward side was as it were wreathed from top to\r\nbottom; he had sent some pieces of it to London, and had none at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nNovember the 20th. This morning I set out in company of a friend, on a\r\njourney to Raccoon in New Jersey, where many Swedes live, who have\r\ntheir own church. We had three miles to go before we came to the ferry\r\nwhich was to bring us over the Delaware. The country here was very low\r\nin some places: the plains on the banks of the river, were overflowed\r\nat every high water or flowing of the tide, and at the ebbing they were\r\nleft dry again. However the inhabitants of the country hereabouts, made\r\nuse of this plain: for that purpose they had in several places thrown\r\nup walls or dykes of earth towards the river, to prevent its\r\noverflowing the plains, which they made use of as meadows. On them the\r\nWater-beeches (Platanus occidentalis, Linn.) were planted in great\r\nnumbers on both sides the road, quite close together: these in summer\r\nafford a pleasant shade, on account of the abundance and size of their\r\nleaves, and make the road extremely delightful, as it resembles a fine\r\nshady walk. The Delaware has nearly the same breadth here, which it has\r\nnear Philadelphia. Near the place where the ferry is to be met with,\r\nseveral pretty houses were built on both sides, where travellers might\r\nget all kinds of refreshment. On our journey from Pensylvania to New\r\nJersey, we were brought over the Delaware in a ferry belonging to, and\r\nkept in repair by the Pensylvania-men; but on our return we were\r\nobliged to take the ferry belonging to the New Jersey side. As soon as\r\nwe had crossed the river, we were in a different province, for the\r\nDelaware makes the division between Pensylvania and New Jersey, so that\r\nevery thing to the west of it belongs to the former, and all to the\r\neast, to the latter province. Both these provinces have in most things\r\ndifferent laws, and their peculiar coin.\r\n\r\nWe now pursued our journey further, and soon observed that the country\r\non this side appeared very different from that on the other; for in\r\nPensylvania the ground consists of more clay and black mould, and is\r\nvery fertile; but in New Jersey it is more sandy and very poor, so that\r\nthe horses went very deep in sand in several parts of the road. Near\r\nthe place where we were brought over, and a little way along the shore\r\nwas a thick firwood: the trees were not very high, but in their\r\ngreatest vigour; between them appeared now and then a low bush of oak.\r\nBut after travelling about three English miles, the firwood ended, and\r\nwe saw no more trees of this kind till we came to the church in\r\nRaccoon. In all the parts of Pensylvania where I have been, I have\r\nfound few firwoods; on the other hand, they are abundant in New Jersey,\r\nand especially in the lower part of that province. We afterwards found\r\nall the day long no other trees, than such as have deciduous leaves;\r\nmost of these were oaks of different sorts, and of considerable height,\r\nbut they stood every where far enough asunder, to admit a chaise to\r\npass through the wood without any inconvenience, there being seldom any\r\nshrubs or underwood between the trees, to obstruct the way. The leaves\r\nwere all fallen, and covered the ground more than a hand’s breadth:\r\nthis had an appearance of encreasing the upper black soil greatly. In\r\nseveral places flowed a small rivulet. The country was commonly plain,\r\nbut sometimes formed a few hills with an easy declivity, though no high\r\nmountains appeared, and in a few places we found some small stones not\r\nbigger than a fist. Single farm houses were scattered in the country,\r\nand in one place only was a small village: the country was yet more\r\ncovered with forests than cultivated, and we were for the greatest part\r\nalways in a wood.\r\n\r\nThis day and the next we passed several Kills, or small rivulets which\r\nflowed out of the country into the Delaware with no great descent nor\r\nrapidity. When the tide came up in the Delaware, it likewise rose in\r\nsome of these rivulets a good way; formerly they must have spread to a\r\nconsiderable breadth by the flowing of the tide, but at present there\r\nwere meadows on their banks, formed, by throwing up strong dykes as\r\nclose as possible to the water, to keep it from overflowing. Such dykes\r\nwere made along all rivers here to confine their water; therefore when\r\nthe tide was highest, the water in the rivers was much higher than the\r\nmeadows: in the dykes were gates through which the water can be drawn\r\nfrom, or led into the meadows; they were sometimes placed on the\r\noutward side of the wall, so that the water in the meadows forced it\r\nopen, but the river water shut it.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we came into the house of a Swede called Peter Rambo,\r\nand we staid the night at his house.\r\n\r\nThe pines which we had seen to day, and which I have mentioned before,\r\nwere of that kind which has double leaves and oblong cones covered with\r\naculeated scales. The English to distinguish it call it the Jersey\r\nPine: commonly there were only two spines or leaves in one fascicle, as\r\nin our common Swedish pines, but sometimes three; the cones had long\r\nspines, so that they were difficult to be touched. These pines look at\r\na distance wholly like the Swedish ones, so that if the cones were not\r\nregarded, they might easily be taken for the same species. Of these\r\npines they make a great quantity of tar, of which I shall speak in the\r\nsequel; but as most of them are but small, they are good for nothing\r\nelse; for if they be employed as posts, or poles in the ground, they\r\nare in a short time rendered useless by rotting: as soon as they are\r\ncut down the worms are very greedy of them; they soon eat through the\r\nwood, and only a few weeks after it is cut down; however it is made use\r\nof as fuel where no other wood is to be got, in several places they\r\nmake charcoal of it, as I intend to mention in the sequel. There is\r\nanother thing which deserves notice, in regard to these trees, and\r\nwhich several people, besides myself, have experienced. In the great\r\nheat of the summer, the cattle like to stand in the shade of these\r\ntrees, preferably to that of the oak, hiccory, walnut, water-beech and\r\nother trees of this kind, whose foliage is very thick; and when the\r\ncattle find the latter with the former, they always choose to stand\r\nunder the firs and pines, though the other trees with annually\r\ndeciduous leaves could afford a better shade: and if there be but a\r\nsingle pine in a wood, as many cattle from the herd as can stand under\r\nit, throng to it. Some people would infer from hence, that the resinous\r\nexhalations of these trees, were beneficial to the cattle, and which\r\nmade them more inclined to be near firs and pines, than any other\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe Spoon tree, which never grows to a great height, we saw this day in\r\nseveral places. The Swedes here have called it thus, because the\r\nIndians who formerly lived in these provinces, used to make their\r\nspoons and trowels of the wood of this tree. In my cabinet of natural\r\ncuriosities, I have a spoon made of this wood by an Indian, who has\r\nkilled many stags and other animals on the very spot where Philadelphia\r\nafterwards was built; for in his time that spot was yet covered with\r\ntrees and shrubs. The English call this tree a Laurel, because its\r\nleaves resemble those of the Laurocerasus. Dr. Linnæus, conformable to\r\nthe peculiar friendship and goodness which he has always honoured me\r\nwith, has been pleased to call this tree, Kalmia foliis ovatis,\r\ncorymbis terminalibus, or Kalmia latifolia. It succeeds best on the\r\nside of hills, especially on the north side, where a brook passes by;\r\ntherefore on meeting with some steep places (on hills) towards a brook,\r\nor with a steep side of a hill towards a marsh, you are sure to find\r\nthe Kalmia. But it frequently stands mixed among beech trees. The\r\nhigher the Kalmias stand on the north side of a mountain, the less they\r\ngrow: I have seen them not only in Pensylvania and New Jersey, but even\r\nin New York, but there they are more scarce: I never found them beyond\r\nthe forty-second deg. of north lat. though I took ever so great care to\r\nlook for them: they have the quality of preserving their fine green\r\nleaves throughout winter, so that when all other trees have lost their\r\nornaments, and stand quite naked, these chear the woods with their\r\ngreen foliage. About the month of May they begin to flower in these\r\nparts, and then their beauty rivals that of most of the known trees in\r\nnature: the flowers are innumerable, and sit in great bunches. Before\r\nthey open, they have a fine red colour, but as they are expanded, the\r\nsun bleaches them, so that some are quite white; many preserve the\r\ncolour of roses. Their shape is singular, for they resemble a crater of\r\nthe ancients: their scent however is none of the most agreeable. In\r\nsome places it was customary to adorn the churches on christmas day or\r\nnew-years day with the fine branches of this tree, which are then thick\r\ncovered with leaves.\r\n\r\nBut these trees are known for another remarkable quality; their leaves\r\nare poison to some animals, and food for others: experience has taught\r\nthe people that when sheep eat of these leaves, they either die\r\nimmediately, or fall very sick, and recover with great difficulty. The\r\nyoung and more tender sheep are killed by a small portion, but the\r\nelder ones can bear a stronger dose. Yet this food will likewise prove\r\nmortal to them, if they take too much of it: the same noxious effect it\r\nshews in regard to calves which eat too much of the leaves: they either\r\ndie, or do not recover easily. I can remember, that in the autumn of\r\nthe year 1748, some calves eat of the leaves, but fell very sick,\r\nswelled, foamed at the mouth, and could hardly stand, however they were\r\ncured by giving them gunpowder and other medicines: the sheep are most\r\nexposed to be tempted by these leaves in winter; for after having been\r\nkept in stables, for some months they are greedy of all greens\r\nespecially if the snow still lies upon the fields, and therefore the\r\ngreen but poisonous leaves of the Kalmia, are to them very tempting.\r\nHorses, oxen and cows which have eaten them, have likewise been very\r\nill after the meal, and though none of them ever died of eating these\r\nleaves, yet most people believed, that if they took too great a portion\r\nof them, death would certainly be the result. For it has been observed\r\nthat when these animals only eat small quantities, yet they suffer\r\ngreat pains. On the other hand the leaves of the Kalmia are the food of\r\nstags, when the snow covers the ground, and hides all other provisions\r\nfrom them. Therefore, if they be shot in winter, their bowels are found\r\nfilled with these leaves; and it is very extraordinary, that if those\r\nbowels are given to dogs, they become quite stupid and as it were\r\ndrunk, and often fall so sick, that they seem to be at the point of\r\ndeath, but the people, who have eaten the venison, have not felt the\r\nleast indisposition. The leaves of the Kalmia are likewise the winter\r\nfood of those birds, which the Swedes in North America call Hazel-hens,\r\nand which stay here all winter, for when they are killed, their crop is\r\nfound quite filled with them.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the Kalmia is very hard, and some people on that account,\r\nmake the axis of their pullies of it. Weavers shuttles are chiefly made\r\nof it, and the weavers are of opinion, that no wood in this country is\r\nbetter for this purpose, for it is compact, may be made very smooth,\r\nand does not easily crack, or burst. The joiners and turners here,\r\nemploy it in making all kinds of work, which requires the best wood;\r\nthey chiefly use the root because it is quite yellow; the wood has a\r\nvery suitable hardness and fineness, and from the center, spread as it\r\nwere small rays, which are at some distance from each other. When the\r\nleaves of the Kalmia are thrown into the fire, they make a crackling\r\nlike salt. The chimney sweepers make brooms in winter of the branches\r\nwith the leaves on them, since they cannot get others in that season.\r\nIn the summer of the year 1750, a certain kind of worms, devoured the\r\nleaves of almost all the trees in Pensylvania; yet they did not venture\r\nto attack the leaves of the Kalmia. Some people asserted, that when a\r\nfire happened in the woods, it never went further, as soon as it came\r\nto the Kalmias, or Spoon trees.\r\n\r\nNovember the 21st. The Swedes and all the other inhabitants of the\r\ncountry plant great quantities of maize, both for themselves and for\r\ntheir cattle. It was asserted that it is the best food for hogs,\r\nbecause it makes them very fat, and gives their flesh an agreeable\r\nflavour, preferable to all other meat. I have given in two\r\ndissertations upon this kind of corn to the Swedish Royal Academy of\r\nSciences, which stand in their Memoirs, one in the Volume for the year\r\n1751, in the last quarter, and the other in the first quarter of the\r\nVolume for the year 1752, and thither I refer my readers.\r\n\r\nThe wheels of the carts which are here made use of, are composed of two\r\ndifferent kinds of wood. The felloes were made of what is called the\r\nSpanish oak, and the spokes of the white oak.\r\n\r\nThe Sassafras tree grows every where in this place. I have already\r\nobserved several particulars in regard to it, and intend to add a few\r\nmore here. On throwing some of the wood into the fire, it causes a\r\ncrackling as salt does. The wood is made use of for posts belonging to\r\nthe enclosures, for it is said to last a long time in the ground: but\r\nit is likewise said, that there is hardly any kind of wood, which is\r\nmore attacked by worms than this, when it is exposed to the air without\r\ncover, and that in a short time it is quite worm-eaten through and\r\nthrough. The Swedes related, that the Indians who formerly inhabited\r\nthese parts, made bowls of it. On cutting some part of the sassafras\r\ntree, or its shoots, and holding it to the nose, it has a strong but\r\npleasant smell. Some people peel the root, and boil the peel with the\r\nbeer which they are brewing, because they believe it wholesome for the\r\nsame reason. The peel is put into brandy, either whilst it is\r\ndistilling, or after it is made.\r\n\r\nAn old Swede remembered that his mother cured many people of the\r\ndropsy, by a decoction of the root of sassafras in water drank every\r\nmorning: but she used, at the same time to cup the patient on the feet.\r\nThe old man assured me, he had often seen people cured by this means,\r\nwho had been brought to his mother wrapped up in sheets.\r\n\r\nWhen a part of a wood is destined for cultivation, the sassafras trees\r\nare commonly left upon it, because they have a very thick foliage, and\r\nafford a cool shade to the cattle, during the great heats. Several of\r\nthe Swedes, wash and scour the vessels in which they intend to keep\r\ncyder, beer or brandy, with water in which the sassafras root or its\r\npeel has been boiled; which they think renders all those liquors more\r\nwholesome. Some people get their bed-posts made of sassafras wood, in\r\norder to expel the bugs; for its strong scent it is said prevents those\r\nvermin from settling in them. For two or three years together this has\r\nthe desired effect; or about as long as the wood keeps its strong\r\naromatic smell; but after that time it has been observed to lose it\r\neffect. A joiner shewed me a bed, which he had made for himself, the\r\nposts of which were of sassafras wood, but as it was ten or twelve\r\nyears old, there were so many bugs in it, that it seemed likely, they\r\nwould not let him sleep peaceably. Some Englishmen related, that some\r\nyears ago it had been customary in London, to drink a kind of tea of\r\nthe flowers of sassafras, because it was looked upon as very salutary;\r\nbut upon recollecting that the same potion was much used against the\r\nvenereal disease, it was soon left off, lest those that used it, should\r\nbe looked upon as infected with that disease. In Pensylvania some\r\npeople put chips of sassafras into their chests, where they keep all\r\nsorts of woollen stuffs, in order to expel the moths (or Larvæ, or\r\ncaterpillars of moths or tinies) which commonly settle in them in\r\nsummer. The root keeps its smell for a long while: I have seen one\r\nwhich had lain five or six years in the drawer of a table, and still\r\npreserved the strength of its scent.\r\n\r\nA Swede named Rambo, related that the Indians formerly dyed all sorts\r\nof leather red with the bark of the chesnut oak.\r\n\r\nSome old people remembered that in the year 1697, there had been so\r\nrigorous a winter, that the ice in the river Delaware was two feet\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nNovember the 22d. Aoke Helm was one of the most considerable Swedes in\r\nthis place, and his father came over into this country along with the\r\nSwedish governor Prince; he was upwards of seventy years of age. This\r\nold man told us, that in his youth there was grass in the woods, which\r\ngrew very close, and was every where two feet high; but, that it was so\r\nmuch lessened at present, that the cattle hardly find food enough, and\r\nthat therefore four cows now give no more milk than one at that time;\r\nbut the causes of this alteration are easy to find. In the younger\r\nyears of old Helm, the country was little inhabited, and hardly the\r\ntenth part of the cattle kept which is at present; a cow had therefore\r\nas much food at that time, as ten now have. Further, most kinds of\r\ngrass here are annual, and do not for several years together shoot up\r\nfrom the same root, as our Swedish grasses: they must sow themselves\r\nevery year, because the last year’s plant dies away every autumn. The\r\ngreat numbers of cattle hinder this sowing, as the grass is eaten\r\nbefore it can produce flowers and fruit. We need not therefore wonder\r\nthat the grass is so thin on fields, hills, and pastures in these\r\nprovinces. This is likewise the reason why travellers in New Jersey,\r\nPensylvania, and Maryland, find many difficulties, especially in\r\nwinter, to get forwards with their own horses, for the grass in these\r\nprovinces is not very abundant, because the cattle eat it before it can\r\nbring seeds: but more to the north, as in Canada, are a sufficient\r\nquantity of perennial grasses; so wisely has the Creator regulated\r\nevery thing. The cold parts of the earth, naturally bring forth a more\r\ndurable grass, because the inhabitants want more hay to feed their\r\ncattle with, on account of the length of the winter. The southern\r\nprovinces again have less perennial grass, as the cattle may be in the\r\nfields all the winter. However careful œconomists have got seeds of\r\nperennial grasses from England, and other European states, and sowed it\r\nin their meadows, where they seem to thrive exceedingly well.\r\n\r\nThe Persimon (Diospyros Virginiana) was pretty common here: I have\r\nalready mentioned it before, but I intend now to add some more\r\nparticulars. Some of its fruits began to ripen and to become fit for\r\neating about this time, for they always ripen very late in autumn, and\r\nthen the people eat them like other fruit: they are very sweet and\r\nglutinous, yet have a little astringency; I frequently used to eat a\r\ngreat quantity of them, without feeling the least inconvenience. From\r\nthe persimon several Englishmen and Swedes brew a very palatable liquor\r\nin the following manner. As soon as the fruit is ripe, a sufficient\r\nquantity is gathered, which is very easy, as each tree is well stocked\r\nwith them. These persimon apples are put into a dough of wheat or other\r\nflour, formed into cakes, and put into an oven, in which they continue\r\ntill they are quite baked, and sufficiently dry, when they are taken\r\nout again: then, in order to brew the liquor, a pot full of water is\r\nput on the fire and some of the cakes are put in: these become soft by\r\ndegrees as the water grows warm, and crumble in pieces at last; the pot\r\nis then taken from the fire, and the water in it well stirred about,\r\nthat the cakes may mix with it: this is then poured into another\r\nvessel, and they continue to steep and break as many cakes as are\r\nnecessary for a brewing: the malt is then infused, and they proceed as\r\nusual with the brewing. Beer thus prepared is reckoned much preferable\r\nto other beer. They likewise make brandy of this fruit in the following\r\nmanner: having collected a sufficient quantity of persimons in autumn,\r\nthey are altogether put into a vessel, where they lie for a week till\r\nthey are quite soft. Then they pour water on them, and in that state\r\nthey are left to ferment of themselves, without promoting the\r\nfermentation by any addition. The brandy is then made in the common\r\nway, and is said to be very good, especially if grapes (in particular\r\nof the sweet sort) which are wild in the woods, be mixed with the\r\npersimon fruit. Some persimons are ripe at the end of September, but\r\nmost of them later, and some not before November and December, when the\r\ncold first overcomes their acrimony. The wood of this tree is very good\r\nfor joiner’s instruments, such as planes, handles to chisels, &c. but\r\nif after being cut down, it lies exposed to sunshine and rain, it is\r\nthe first wood which rots, and in a year’s time there is nothing left\r\nbut what is useless. When the persimon trees get once into a field,\r\nthey are not easily got out of it again, as they spread so much. I was\r\ntold, that if you cut off a branch and put it into the ground, it\r\nstrikes root, but in very strong winters, these trees often die by\r\nfrost, and they, together with the peach trees, bear cold the least of\r\nany.\r\n\r\nNovember the 23d. Several kinds of gourds and melons are cultivated\r\nhere: they have partly been originally cultivated by the Indians, and\r\npartly brought over by Europeans. Of the gourds there was a kind which\r\nwere crooked at the end, and oblong in general, and therefore they were\r\ncalled crooked necks (Crocknacks;) they keep almost all winter. There\r\nis yet another species of gourds which have the same quality: others\r\nagain are cut in pieces or slips, drawn upon thread and dried; they\r\nkeep all the year long, and are then boiled or stewed. All sorts of\r\ngourds are prepared for eating in different manners, as is likewise\r\ncustomary in Sweden. Many farmers have a whole field of gourds.\r\n\r\nSquashes are a kind of gourds, which the Europeans got from the\r\nIndians, and I have already mentioned them before. They are eaten\r\nboiled, either with flesh or by themselves. In the first case, they are\r\nput on the edge of the dish round the meat; they require little care,\r\nfor into whatever ground they are sown, they grow in it and succeed\r\nwell. If the seed is put into the fields in autumn, it brings squashes\r\nnext spring, though during winter it has suffered from frost, snow and\r\nwet.\r\n\r\nThe Calabashes are likewise gourds, which are planted in quantities by\r\nthe Swedes and other inhabitants, but they are not fit for eating, and\r\nare made use of for making all sorts of vessels; they are more tender\r\nthan the squashes, for they do not always ripen here, and only when the\r\nweather is very warm. In order to make vessels of them, they are first\r\ndried well: the seeds, together with the pulpy and spungy matter in\r\nwhich they lie, are afterwards taken out and thrown away. The shells\r\nare scraped very clean within, and then great spoons or ladles,\r\nfunnels, bowls, dishes and the like may be made of them; they are\r\nparticularly fit for keeping seeds of plants in, which are to be sent\r\nover sea, for they keep their power of vegetating much longer, if they\r\nbe put in calabashes, than by any other means. Some people scrape the\r\noutside of the calabashes before they are opened, dry them afterwards\r\nand then clean them within; this makes them as hard as bones: they are\r\nsometimes washed, so that they always keep their white colour.\r\n\r\nMost of the farmers in this country, sow Buck-wheat, in the middle of\r\nJuly; it must not be sown later, for in that case the frost ruins it,\r\nbut if it be sown before July, it flowers all the summer long, but the\r\nflowers drop, and no seed is generated. Some people, plough the ground\r\ntwice where they intend to sow buck-wheat; others plough it only once,\r\nabout two weeks before they sow it. As soon as it is sown the field is\r\nharrowed. It has been found by experience, that in a wet year\r\nbuck-wheat is most likely to succeed: it stands on the fields till the\r\nfrost comes on. When the crop is favourable, they get twenty, thirty\r\nand even forty bushels from one. The Swedish churchwarden Ragnilson, in\r\nwhose house we were at this time, had got such a crop: they make\r\nbuck-wheat cakes and pudding. The cakes are commonly made in the\r\nmorning, and are baked in a frying pan, or on a stone: are buttered and\r\nthen eaten with tea or coffee, instead of toasted bread with butter, or\r\ntoast, which the English commonly eat at breakfast. The buck-wheat\r\ncakes are very good, and are likewise usual at Philadelphia and in\r\nother English colonies, especially in winter. Buck-wheat is an\r\nexcellent food for fowls; they eat it greedily, and lay more eggs, than\r\nthey do with other food: hogs are likewise fattened with it. Buck-wheat\r\nstraw is of no use; it is therefore left upon the field, in the places\r\nwhere it has been thrashed, or it is scattered in the orchards, in\r\norder to serve as a manure by putrifying. Neither cattle nor any other\r\nanimal will eat of it, except in the greatest necessity, when the snow\r\ncovers the ground and nothing else is to be met with. But though\r\nbuck-wheat is so common in the English colonies, yet the French had no\r\nright notion of it in Canada, and it was never cultivated among them.\r\n\r\nTowards night we found some Glow Worms in the wood, their body was\r\nlinear, consisting of eleven articulations, a little pointed before and\r\nbehind; the length from head to tail was five and a half geometrical\r\nlines; the colour was brown and the articulations joined in the same\r\nmanner as in the onisci or woodlice. The antennæ or feel horns were\r\nshort and filiform, or thread-shaped; and the feet were fastened to the\r\nforemost articulations of the body: when the insect creeps, its\r\nhindmost articulations are dragged on the ground, and help its motion.\r\nThe extremity of the tail contain a matter which shines in the dark,\r\nwith a green light: the insect could draw it in, so that it was not\r\nvisible. It had rained considerably all day, yet they crept in great\r\nnumbers among the bushes, so that the ground seemed as it were sown\r\nwith stars. I shall in the sequel have occasion to mention another kind\r\nof insects or flies which shine in the dark, when flying in the air.\r\n\r\nNovember the 24th. Holly, or Ilex Aquifolium, grows in wet places,\r\nscattered in the forest, and belongs to the rare trees; its leaves are\r\ngreen both in summer and in winter. The Swedes dry its leaves, bruise\r\nthem in a mortar, boil them in small beer, and take them against the\r\npleurisy.\r\n\r\nRed is dyed with brasil wood, and likewise with a kind of moss, which\r\ngrows on the trees here: blue is dyed with Indigo, but to get a black\r\ncolour, the leaves of the common field sorrel (Rumex Acetosella) are\r\nboiled with the stuff to be dyed, which is then dried, and boiled again\r\nwith log-wood and copperas: the black colour thus produced, is said to\r\nbe very durable. The people spin and weave a great part of their every\r\nday’s apparel, and dye them in their houses. Flax is cultivated by many\r\npeople, and succeeds very well, but the use of hemp is not very common.\r\n\r\nRye, wheat, and buck-wheat are cut with the sickle, but oats are mown\r\nwith a scythe. The sickles which are here made use of are long and\r\nnarrow, and their sharp edges have close teeth on the inner side. The\r\nfield lies fallow during a year, and in that time the cattle may graze\r\non it.\r\n\r\nAll the inhabitants of this place from the highest to the lowest, have\r\neach their orchard, which is greater or less according to their wealth.\r\nThe trees in it are chiefly peach trees, apple trees and cherry trees:\r\ncompare with this what I have already said upon this subject before.\r\n\r\nA little before noon, we left this place and continued our journey,\r\npast the Swedish church in Raccoon, to Peils groves. The country, on\r\nthe sides of this road, is very sandy in many places and pretty near\r\nlevel. Here and there appear single farms, yet they are very scarce,\r\nand large extensive pieces of ground are still covered with forests,\r\nwhich chiefly consist of several species of oak and hiccory. However we\r\ncould go with ease through these woods, as there are few bushes (or\r\nunder-wood) and stones to be met with. It was not only easy to ride in\r\nevery part of the wood on horseback, but even in most places there was\r\nsufficient room for a small coach or a cart. Sometimes a few lying\r\ntrees which had been thrown on the ground by a hurricane, or had fallen\r\ndown through great age, caused some hindrance.\r\n\r\nNovember the 25th. During my stay at Raccoon, at this time and all the\r\nensuing winter, I endeavoured to get the most information from the old\r\nSwedes relating to the increase of land, and the decrease of water in\r\nthese parts; I shall therefore insert the answers here, which I have\r\nreceived to my questions. They are as I got them, and I shall only\r\nthrow in a few remarks which may serve to explain things: the reader\r\ntherefore is left at liberty to draw his own inferences and\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nOne of the Swedes, called King, who was above fifty years of age, was\r\nconvinced, that about this time the little lakes, brooks, springs and\r\nrivers had much less water, than they had when he was a boy. He could\r\nmention several lakes on which the people went in large boats in his\r\nyouth, and had sufficient water even in the hottest summers; but now,\r\nthey were either entirely dried up, or for the greatest part; and in\r\nthe latter case, all the water was lost in summer. He had himself seen\r\nthe fish dying in them, and he was apt to believe that at this time it\r\ndid not rain so much in summer, as it did when he was young. One of his\r\nrelations, who lived about eight miles from the river Delaware, on a\r\nhill near a rivulet, had got a well, dug in his court yard: at the\r\ndepth of forty feet, they found a quantity of shells of oysters and\r\nmuscles, and likewise a great quantity of reed, and pieces of broken\r\nbranches. I asked, to what causes they ascribed what they had\r\ndiscovered? and I was answered, that some people believed these things\r\nhad lain there ever since the deluge, and others, that the ground\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nPeter Rambo, a man who was near sixty years of age, assured me that in\r\nseveral places at Raccoon, where wells had been dug, or any other work\r\ncarried deep into the ground, he had seen great quantities of muscle\r\nshells and other marine animals. On digging wells, the people have\r\nsometimes met with logs of wood at the depth of twenty feet, some of\r\nwhich were putrified, and others as it were burnt. They once found a\r\ngreat spoon in the ground, at this depth. Query, Is it not probable,\r\nthat the burnt wood which has been thus dug up, was only blackened by a\r\nsubterraneous mineral vapour? People however have concluded from this,\r\nthat America has had inhabitants before the deluge. This man (Peter\r\nRambo) further told me, that bricks had been found deep in the ground;\r\nbut may not the brick coloured clay (of which the ground here chiefly\r\nconsists, and which is a mixture of clay and sand) in a hard state have\r\nhad the appearance of bricks? I have seen such hardened clay, which at\r\nfirst sight is easily mistaken for brick. He likewise asserted, that\r\nthe water in rivers was still as high as it used to be, as far back as\r\nmemory could reach; but little lakes, ponds, and waters in marshes are\r\nvisibly decreased, and many of them dried up.\r\n\r\nMaons Keen, a Swede above seventy years old, asserted, that on digging\r\na well he had seen at the depth of forty feet, a great piece of chesnut\r\nwood, together with roots and stalks of reed, and a clayey earth like\r\nthat which commonly covers the shores of salt water bays and coves.\r\nThis clay had a similar smell and a saline taste. Maons Keen and\r\nseveral other people inferred from hence, that the whole country where\r\nRaccoon and Penn’s neck are situated, was anciently quite overflowed by\r\nthe sea. They likewise knew, that at a great depth in the ground, such\r\na trowel as the Indians make use of, had been found.\r\n\r\nSven Lock, and William Cobb, both above fifty years of age agreed, that\r\nin many places hereabouts, where wells had been dug, they had seen a\r\ngreat quantity of reed, mostly rotten, at the depth of twenty or thirty\r\nfeet and upwards.\r\n\r\nAs Cobb made a well for himself, the workmen after digging twenty feet\r\ndeep, came upon so thick a branch, that they could not get forwards,\r\ntill it was cut in two places; the wood was still very hard. It is very\r\ncommon to find near the surface of the earth, quantities of all sorts\r\nof leaves not quite putrified. On making a dyke some years ago, along\r\nthe river on which the church at Raccoon stands; and for that purpose\r\ncutting through a bank, it was found quite full of oyster shells,\r\nthough this place is above a hundred and twenty English miles from the\r\nnearest sea shore. These men, and all the inhabitants of Raccoon,\r\nconcluded from this circumstance (of their own accord, and without\r\nbeing led to the thought) that this tract of land was a part of the sea\r\nmany centuries ago. They likewise asserted that many little lakes,\r\nwhich in their youth were full of water, even in the hottest season,\r\nnow hardly formed a narrow brook in summer, except after heavy rains;\r\nbut it did not appear to them that the rivers had lost any water.\r\n\r\nAoke Helm, found (on digging a well) first sand and little stones, to\r\nthe depth of eight feet; next a pale coloured clay, and then a black\r\none. At the depth of fifteen feet he found a piece of hard wood, and\r\nseveral pieces of mundick or pyrites. He told me that he knew several\r\nplaces in the Delaware, where the people went in boats, when he was\r\nyoung; but which at present were changed into little islands, some of\r\nwhich were near an English mile in length. These islands derive their\r\norigin from a sand or bank in the river; on this the water washes some\r\nclay, in which rushes come up, and thus the rest is generated by\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nOn a meeting of the oldest Swedes in the parish of Raccoon, I obtained\r\nthe following answers to the questions which I asked them on this\r\naccount. Whenever they dig a well in this neighbourhood, they always\r\nfind at the depth of twenty or thirty feet, great numbers of oyster\r\nshells and clams: the latter are, as was above-mentioned, a kind of\r\nlarge shells, which are found in bays, and of which the Indians make\r\ntheir money. In many places, on digging wells a quantity of rushes and\r\nreeds have been found almost wholly undamaged; and once on such an\r\noccasion a whole bundle of flax was brought up, found between twenty\r\nand thirty feet under ground; it seemed as little damaged as if it had\r\nbeen lately put under ground; all looked at it with astonishment, as it\r\nwas beyond conception how it could get there; but I believe the good\r\npeople saw some American plants, such as the wild Virginian flax, or\r\nLinum Virginianum, and the Antirrhinum Canadense, which look very like\r\ncommon flax, yet it is remarkable that the bundle was really tied\r\ntogether. The Europeans on their arrival in America, found our common\r\nflax neither growing wild nor cultivated by the Indians, how then could\r\nthis bundle get into the ground? Can it be supposed, that past ages\r\nhave seen a nation here, so early acquainted with the use of flax? I\r\nwould rather abide by the opinion, that the above American plants, or\r\nother similar ones, have been taken for flax. Charcoal and firebrands\r\nhave often been found under ground: The Swedish churchwarden, Eric\r\nRagnilson, told me that he had seen a quantity of them, which had been\r\nbrought up at the digging of a well: on such occasions, people have\r\noften found (at the depth of between twenty and fifty feet) great\r\nbranches and blocks. There were some spots where twenty feet under the\r\nsurface of the earth, the people had found such trowels as the Indians\r\nuse: from these observations they all concluded, that this tract of\r\nland had formerly been the bottom of the sea. It is to be observed,\r\nthat most of the wells which have hitherto been made, have been dug in\r\nnew settlements, where the wood was yet standing, and had probably\r\nstood for centuries together. From the observations which have hitherto\r\nbeen mentioned, and to which I shall add similar ones in the sequel, we\r\nmay, with a considerable degree of certainty conclude, that a great\r\npart of the province of New Jersey, in ages unknown to posterity, was\r\npart of the bottom of the sea, and was afterwards formed by the slime\r\nand mud, and the many other things which the river Delaware carries\r\ndown along with it, from the upper parts of the country: however Cape\r\nMay seems to give some occasion for doubts, of which I shall speak in\r\nthe sequel.\r\n\r\nNovember the 27th. The American evergreens are\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. Ilex Aquifolium, holly.\r\n     2. Kalmia latifolia, the spoon tree.\r\n     3. Kalmia angustifolia, another species of it.\r\n     4. Magnolia glauca, the beaver tree. The young trees of this kind\r\n        only keep their leaves, the others drop them.\r\n     5. Viscum album, or misletoe; this commonly grows upon the Nyssa\r\n        aquatica, or tupelo tree, upon the Liquidambar styraciflua, or\r\n        sweet gum tree, the oak and lime tree, so that their whole\r\n        summits were frequently quite green in winter.\r\n     6. Myrica cerifera, or the candleberry tree; of this however only\r\n        some of the youngest shrubs preserve some leaves, but most of\r\n        them had already lost them.\r\n     7. Pinus Abies, the pine.\r\n     8. Pinus sylvestris, the fir.\r\n     9. Cupressus thyoides, the white cedar.\r\n    10. Juniperus Virginiana, the red cedar.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral oaks and other trees dropt their leaves here in winter, which\r\nhowever keep them ever green, a little more to the south, and in\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nNovember the 30th. It has been observed, that the Europeans in North\r\nAmerica, whether they were born in Sweden, England, Germany or Holland;\r\nor in North America, of European parents, always lost their teeth much\r\nsooner than common; the women especially were subject to this\r\ndisagreeable circumstance, the men did not suffer so much from it.\r\nGirls not above twenty years old, frequently had lost half of their\r\nteeth, without any hopes of getting new ones: I have attempted to\r\npenetrate into the causes of this early shedding of the teeth, but I\r\nknow not, whether I have hit upon a true one. Many people were of\r\nopinion that the air of this country hurt the teeth: so much is certain\r\nthat the weather can no where be subject to more frequent and sudden\r\nchanges; for the end of a hot day, often turns out piercing cold, and\r\nvice versa. Yet this change of weather, cannot be looked upon as having\r\nany effect upon the shedding of the teeth, for the Indians prove the\r\ncontrary: they live in the same air, and always keep fine, entire white\r\nteeth; this I have seen myself, and have been assured of by every body:\r\nothers ascribe it to the great quantities of fruit and sweet meats\r\nwhich are here eaten. But I have known many people, who never eat any\r\nfruit, and nevertheless had hardly a tooth left.\r\n\r\nI then began to suspect the tea, which is drank here in the morning and\r\nafternoon, especially by women, and is so common at present, that there\r\nis hardly a farmer’s wife or a poor woman, who does not drink tea in\r\nthe morning: I was confirmed in this opinion when I took a journey\r\nthrough some parts of the country which were still inhabited by\r\nIndians. For Major General Johnson told me at that time, that several\r\nof the Indians who lived close to the European settlements, had learnt\r\nto drink tea. And it has been observed, that such of the Indian women,\r\nas used themselves too much to this liquor, had in the same manner as\r\nthe European women, lost their teeth prematurely, though they had\r\nformerly been quite sound. Those again, who had not used tea preserved\r\ntheir teeth strong and sound to a great age.\r\n\r\nI afterwards found, that the use of tea could not entirely cause this\r\naccident. Several young women who lived in this country, but were born\r\nin Europe, complained that they lost most of their teeth after they\r\ncame to America: I asked, whether they did not think that it arose from\r\nthe frequent use of tea, as it was known, that strong tea, as it were\r\nenters into and corrodes the teeth; but they answered, that they had\r\nlost their teeth before they had began to drink tea, but continuing my\r\nenquiries, I found at last a sufficient cause, to account for the loss\r\nof their teeth: each of these women owned, that they were accustomed to\r\neat every thing hot, and nothing was good in their opinion, unless they\r\ncould eat it as fast as it came from the fire. This is likewise the\r\ncase with the women in the country who lose their teeth much sooner and\r\nmore abundantly than the men. They drink tea in greater quantity and\r\nmuch oftener, in the morning, and even at noon, when the employment of\r\nthe men will not allow them to sit at the tea-table. Besides that, the\r\nEnglishmen care very little for tea, and a bowl of punch is much more\r\nagreeable to them. When the English women drink tea, they never pour it\r\nout of the cup into the saucer, but drink it hot as it is out of the\r\nformer. The Indian women in imitation of them, swallow the tea in the\r\nsame manner. On the contrary those Indians whose teeth are sound, never\r\neat any thing hot, but take their meat either quite cold, or only just\r\nmilk warm.\r\n\r\nI asked the Swedish churchwarden in Philadelphia, Mr. Bengtson, and a\r\nnumber of old Swedes, whether their parents and countrymen had likewise\r\nlost their teeth as soon as the American colonists; but they told me\r\nthat they had preserved them to a very great age. Bengtson assured me,\r\nthat his father at the age of seventy, cracked peach stones and the\r\nblack walnuts with his teeth, notwithstanding their great hardness,\r\nwhich at this time no body dares to venture at that age. This confirms\r\nwhat I have before said, for at that time the use of tea was not yet\r\nknown in North America.\r\n\r\nNo disease is more common here, than that which the English call fever\r\nand ague, which is sometimes quotidian, tertian or quartan. But it\r\noften happens, that a person who has had a tertian ague, after losing\r\nit for a week or two, gets a quotidian ague in its stead, which after a\r\nwhile again changes into a tertian. The fever commonly attacks the\r\npeople at the end of August, or beginning of September, and commonly\r\ncontinues during autumn and winter till towards spring, when it ceases\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nStrangers who arrive here, commonly are attacked by this sickness the\r\nfirst or second year after their arrival; and it is more violent upon\r\nthem, than upon the natives, so that they sometimes die of it; but if\r\nthey escape the first time, they have the advantage of not being\r\nvisited again the next year, or perhaps never any more. It is commonly\r\nsaid here, that strangers get the fever to accustom them to the\r\nclimate. The natives of European offspring, have annual fits of this\r\nague in some parts of the country: some however are soon delivered from\r\nit, with others on the contrary it continues for six months together,\r\nand others are afflicted with it till they die. The Indians also suffer\r\nit, but not so violently as the Europeans. No age is secured against\r\nit: in those places where it rages annually, you see old men and women\r\nattacked with it; and even children in the cradle, sometimes not above\r\nthree weeks old: it is likewise quotidian, tertian or quartan with\r\nthem. This autumn the ague was more violent here, than it commonly used\r\nto be. People who are afflicted with it, look as pale as death, and are\r\ngreatly weakened, but in general are not prevented from doing their\r\nwork in the intervals. It is remarkable, that every year there are\r\ngreat parts of the country where this fever rages, and others where\r\nscarce a single person has been taken ill. It likewise is worth notice,\r\nthat there are places where the people cannot remember that it formerly\r\nprevailed in their country, though at present it begins to grow more\r\ncommon: yet there was no other visible difference between the several\r\nplaces. All the old Swedes, Englishmen, Germans, &c. unanimously\r\nasserted, that the fever had never been so violent, and of such\r\ncontinuance when they were boys, as it is at present. They were\r\nlikewise generally of opinion, that about the year 1680, there were not\r\nso many people afflicted with it, as about this time. However others\r\nequally old, were of opinion that the fever was proportionably as\r\ncommon formerly, as it is at present; but that it could not at that\r\ntime be so sensibly perceived, on account of the scarcity of\r\ninhabitants, and the great distance of their settlements from each\r\nother; it is therefore probable that the effects of the fever have at\r\nall times been equal.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to determine the true causes of this disease;\r\nthey seem to be numerous, and not always alike: sometimes, and I\r\nbelieve commonly several of them unite. I have taken all possible care\r\nto sound the opinions of the physicians here on that head, and I here\r\noffer them to the reader.\r\n\r\nSome of them think that the peculiar qualities of the air of this\r\ncountry cause this fever; but most of them assert that it is generated\r\nby the standing and putrid water, which it seems is confirmed by\r\nexperience. For it has been observed in this country, that such people\r\nas live in the neighbourhood of Morasses or Swamps, or in places where\r\na stagnant, stinking water is to be met with, are commonly infested\r\nwith the fever and ague every year, and get it more readily than\r\nothers. And this chiefly happens at a time of the year when those\r\nstagnant waters are most evaporated by the excessive heat of the sun,\r\nand the air is filled with the most noxious vapors. The fever likewise\r\nis very violent in all places which have a very low situation, and\r\nwhere salt water comes up with the tide twice in twenty four hours, and\r\nunites with the stagnant, fresh water in the country. Therefore on\r\ntravelling in summer over such low places where fresh and salt water\r\nunite, the nauseous stench arising from thence often forces the\r\ntraveller to stop his nose. On that account most of the inhabitants of\r\nPenn’s neck, and Salem in New Jersey, where the ground has the\r\nabove-mentioned quality, are annually infested with the fever to a much\r\ngreater degree, than the inhabitants of the higher country. If an\r\ninhabitant of the higher part of the country, where the people are free\r\nfrom the fever, removes into the lower parts, he may be well assured\r\nthat the fever will attack him at the usual time, and that he will get\r\nit again every year, as long as he continues in that country. People of\r\nthe liveliest complexion on coming into the low parts of the country,\r\nand continuing there for some time, have entirely lost their colour and\r\nbecome quite pale. However this cannot be the sole cause of the fever,\r\nas I have been in several parts of the country which had a low\r\nsituation and had stagnant waters near them, where the people declared\r\nthey seldom suffered from this sickness: but these places were about\r\ntwo or three degrees more northerly.\r\n\r\nOthers were of opinion that diet did very much towards it, and chiefly\r\nlaid the blame upon the inconsiderate and intemperate consumption of\r\nfruit. This is particularly the case with the Europeans, who come into\r\nAmerica, and are not used to its climate and its fruit; for those who\r\nare born here can bear more, yet are not entirely free from the bad\r\neffects of eating too much. I have heard many Englishmen, Germans, and\r\nothers speak from their own experience on this account; they owned,\r\nthat they had often tried, and were certain that after eating a water\r\nmelon once or twice before they had breakfasted, they would have the\r\nfever and ague in a few days after. Yet it is remarkable, that the\r\nFrench in Canada told me that fevers were less common in that country,\r\nthough they consumed as many water melons as the English colonies, and\r\nthat it had never been observed that they occasioned a fever; but that\r\non coming in the hot season to the Illinois, an Indian nation which is\r\nnearly in the same latitude with Pensylvania and New Jersey, they could\r\nnot eat a water melon without feeling the shaking fits of an ague, and\r\nthat the Indians therefore warned them not to eat of so dangerous a\r\nfruit. Query, Does not this lead us to think that the greater heat in\r\nPensylvania, and the country of the Illinois, which are both five or\r\nsix degrees more southerly than Canada, makes fruit in some measure\r\nmore dangerous? In the English North American colonies, every\r\ncountryman plants a number of water melons, which are eaten whilst the\r\npeople make hay, or during the harvest when they have nothing upon\r\ntheir stomachs, in order to cool them during the great heat, as that\r\njuicy fruit seems very proper to give refreshment. In the same manner\r\nmelons, cucumbers, gourds, squashes, mulberries, apples, peaches,\r\ncherries, and such like fruit are eaten here in summer, and altogether\r\ncontribute to the attacks of the ague.\r\n\r\nBut that the manner of living contributes greatly towards it, may be\r\nconcluded from the unanimous accounts of old people, concerning the\r\ntimes of their childhood; according to which, the inhabitants of these\r\nparts, were at that time not subject to so many diseases as they are at\r\npresent, and people were seldom sick. All the old Swedes likewise\r\nagreed, that their countrymen, who first came into North America,\r\nattained to a great age, and their children nearly to the same; but\r\nthat their grand children, and great grand children did not reach the\r\nage of their ancestors, and their health was not near so vigorous and\r\ndurable. But the Swedes who first settled in America, lived very\r\nfrugally; they were poor, and could not buy rum, brandy, or other\r\nstrong liquors, which they seldom distilled themselves, as few of them\r\nhad a distilling vessel. However they sometimes had a good strong beer.\r\nThey did not understand the art of making cyder, which is now so common\r\nin the country: tea, coffee, chocolate, which are at present even the\r\ncountry people’s daily breakfast, were wholly unknown to them: most of\r\nthem had never tasted sugar or punch. The tea which is now drank, is\r\neither very old, or mixed with all sorts of herbs, so that it no longer\r\ndeserves the name of tea: therefore it cannot have any good effect upon\r\nthose who use it plentifully; besides, it cannot fail of relaxing the\r\nbowels, as it is drank both in the morning and in the afternoon quite\r\nboiling hot. The Indians, the offspring of the first inhabitants of\r\nthis country, are a proof of what I have said. It is well known that\r\ntheir ancestors, at the time of the first arrival of the Europeans,\r\nlived to a very great age. According to the common accounts, it was\r\nthen not uncommon to find people among the Indians, who were above a\r\nhundred years old: they lived frugally, and drank pure water: brandy,\r\nrum, wine, and all the other strong liquors, were utterly unknown to\r\nthem; but since the christians have taught them to drink these liquors,\r\nand the Indians have found them too palatable, those who cannot resist\r\ntheir appetites, hardly reach half the age of their parents.\r\n\r\nLastly, some people pretended that the loss of many odoriferous plants,\r\nwith which the woods were filled at the arrival of the Europeans, but\r\nwhich the cattle has now extirpated, might be looked upon as a cause of\r\nthe greater progress of the fever at present. The number of those\r\nstrong plants occasioned a pleasant scent to rise in the woods every\r\nmorning and evening. It is therefore not unreasonable to think that the\r\nnoxiousness of the effluvia from putrifying substances was then\r\nprevented, so that they were not so dangerous to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSeveral remedies are employed against this disease: the jesuit’s bark\r\nwas formerly a certain one, but at present it has not always this\r\neffect, though they sell it genuine, and for the very best. Many people\r\naccused it of leaving something noxious in the body. Yet it was\r\ncommonly observed, that when the bark was good, and it was taken as\r\nsoon as the fever made its appearance, and before the body was\r\nweakened, it was almost sure to conquer the fever, so that the cold\r\nfits never returned, and no pain or stiffness remained in the limbs;\r\nbut when the disease is rooted in, and has considerably weakened the\r\npatients, or they are naturally very weak, the fever leaves them after\r\nusing the jesuit’s bark, but returns again in a fortnight’s time, and\r\nobliges them to take the bark again; but the consequence frequently is\r\na pain and a stiffness in their limbs, and sometimes in their bowels,\r\nwhich almost hinders them from walking: this pain continues for several\r\nyears together, and even accompanies some to the grave. This bad effect\r\nis partly attributed to the bark, which can seldom be got genuine here,\r\nand partly to the little care which the patients take in using the\r\nbark. A man of my acquaintance was particularly dexterous in expelling\r\nthe ague by the use of the jesuit’s bark. His manner of proceeding was\r\nas follows: when it was possible, the patient must use the remedy as\r\nsoon as the fever begun, and before it was settled in his body: but\r\nbefore he took the medicine, he was to take a diaphoretic remedy, as\r\nthat had been found very salutary; and as the fever is frequently of\r\nsuch a nature here, as not to make the patient sweat, even when the hot\r\nfit is upon him, a perspiration was to be brought about by some other\r\nmeans. To that purpose the patient took his dose on the day when he had\r\nhis cold fit, and was not allowed to eat any thing at night. The next\r\nmorning he continued in a warm bed, drank a quantity of tea, and was\r\nwell covered that he might perspire plentifully. He continued so till\r\nthe perspiration ceased, and then left the bed in a hot room, and\r\nwashed his body with milk warm water, in order to cleanse it from the\r\nimpurities that settled on it from the perspiration, and to prevent\r\ntheir stopping up of the pores. The patient was then dried again, and\r\nat last he took the bark several times in one day. This was repeated\r\ntwice or thrice on the days after he had the ague, and it commonly left\r\nhim without returning, and most people recover so well, that they do\r\nnot look pale after their sickness.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the root of the Tulip tree, or Liriodendron Tulipifera,\r\ntaken in the same manner as the jesuit’s bark, sometimes had a similar\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nSeveral people peeled the roots of the Cornus florida, or Dog wood, and\r\ngave this peel to the patients; and even some people, who could not be\r\ncured by the jesuit’s bark, have recovered by the help of this. I have\r\nlikewise seen people cured of the fever, by taking brimstone reduced to\r\npowder, and mixed with sugar every night before they went to bed, and\r\nevery morning before they got up: they took it three or four times in\r\nthe intervals, and at each time drank some warm liquor, to wash the\r\npowder down. However others that tried the same remedy did not find\r\nmuch relief from it.\r\n\r\nSome people collected the yellow bark of the peach tree, especially\r\nthat which is on the root and boiled it in water, till half of it was\r\nevaporated by boiling. Of this decoction the patient took every morning\r\nabout a wine glass full, before he had eaten any thing. This liquor has\r\na disagreeable taste, and contracts the mouth and tongue like alum; yet\r\nseveral persons at Raccoon who had tried many remedies in vain, were\r\ncured by this.\r\n\r\nOthers boiled the leaves of the Potentilla reptans, or of the\r\nPotentilla canadensis, in water, and made the patients drink it before\r\nthe ague fit came on, and it is well known that several persons have\r\nrecovered by this means.\r\n\r\nThe people who are settled upon the river Mohawk in New York, both\r\nIndians and Europeans collect the root of the Geum rivale, and pound\r\nit. This powder some of them boil in water till it is a pretty strong\r\ndecoction: others only infuse cold water on it and leave it so for a\r\nday; others mix it with brandy. Of this medicine the patient is to take\r\na wine glass full on the morning of the day when the fever does not\r\ncome, before he has eaten any thing. I was assured that this was one of\r\nthe surest remedies, and more certain than the jesuit’s bark.\r\n\r\nThe people who live near the iron mines, declared that they were seldom\r\nor never visited by the fever and ague; but when they have the fever,\r\nthey drink the water of such fountains, as arise from the iron mines,\r\nand have a strong chalybeat taste; and they assured me that this remedy\r\nwas infallible. Other people therefore who did not live very far from\r\nsuch springs, went to them for a few days, when they had the fever, in\r\norder to drink the water, which commonly cured them.\r\n\r\nI have already shown above, that sage mixed with lemon juice, has been\r\nfound very salutary against the ague.\r\n\r\nIt was however universally remarkable, that that which cures one person\r\nof it, has no effect upon another.\r\n\r\nThe pleurisy is likewise a disease which the people of this country are\r\nmuch subject to. The Swedes in this province call it stitches and\r\nburning, and they always mean the pleurisy whenever they mention those\r\nwords. Many of the old Swedes told me that they had heard very little\r\nof it when they were young, and that their parents had known still less\r\nof it in their childhood; but that it was so common now, that many\r\npeople died every year of it: yet it has been observed, that in some\r\nyears this disease has been very moderate, and taken few people away\r\nwith it, whilst in other years it makes great havock: it likewise is\r\nmore violent in some places than in others.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the year 1728, it swept away many at Penn’s neck, a\r\nplace below Raccoon, and nearer to the Delaware, where a number of\r\nSwedes are settled. Almost all the Swedes there died of it, though they\r\nwere very numerous. From hence it happened that their children who were\r\nleft in a very tender age, and grew up among the English children,\r\nforgot their mother tongue, so that few of them understand it at\r\npresent. Since that time, though the pleurisy has every year killed a\r\nfew people at Penn’s neck, yet it has not carried off any considerable\r\nnumbers. It rested as it were till the autumn of the year 1748, but\r\nthen it began to make dreadful havock, and every week six or ten of the\r\nold people died. The disease was so violent, that when it attacked a\r\nperson, he seldom lived above two or three days; and of those who were\r\ntaken ill with it, very few recovered. When the pleurisy was got into a\r\nhouse, it killed most of the old people in it: it was a true pleurisy,\r\nbut it had a peculiarity with it, for it commonly began with a great\r\nswelling under the throat and in the neck, and with a difficulty of\r\nswallowing. Some people looked upon it as contagious; and others\r\nseriously declared, that when it came into a family, not only those who\r\nlived in the same house suffered from it, but even such relations as\r\nlived far off. There have been several people at Penn’s neck, who,\r\nwithout visiting their sick friends, have got the pleurisy and died of\r\nit: I do not dispute the truth of this, though I do not agree to the\r\nconclusion. The pleurisy was the most violent in November; yet some old\r\npeople died of it even in the next winter; but children were pretty\r\nfree from it. The physicians did not know what to make of it, nor how\r\nto remedy it.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine the causes of such violent diseases. An\r\nold English surgeon who lived here gave the following reason. The\r\ninhabitants of this country drink great quantities of punch and other\r\nstrong liquors in summer, when it is very hot; by that means the veins\r\nin the diaphragm contract, and the blood grows thick. Towards the end\r\nof October and the beginning of November, the weather is apt to alter\r\nvery suddenly, so that heat and cold change several times a day. When\r\nthe people during this changeable weather are in the open air, they\r\ncommonly get this disease. It is likewise certain that the air is more\r\nunwholesome one year, than another, which depends upon the heat, and\r\nother circumstances: this peculiar quality of the air must of course\r\nproduce a pleurisy. It is remarkable, that both in the year 1728, and\r\nin the present, when so many people died at Penn’s neck, few died at\r\nRaccoon, though the two places are near each other, and seem to have\r\nthe same soil and climate. But there is this difference that Penn’s\r\nneck lies remarkably low, and Raccoon pretty high. The people in the\r\nformer place have settled between marshes and swamps, in which the\r\nwater stagnates and putrifies; and most of these places are covered\r\nwith trees, by which means the wet is shut up still more, and near such\r\nmarshes, are the houses. Lastly the water at Penn’s neck is not\r\nreckoned so good as that in Raccoon, but has some taste. It likewise\r\nbecomes brackish in several little rivers when the Delaware during the\r\ntide rises very high, and runs up into them. On the banks of these\r\nrivulets live many of the Swedes, and take water for common use from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDecember the 3d. This morning I set out for Philadelphia, where I\r\narrived in the evening.\r\n\r\nWild grapes are very abundant in the woods, and of various kinds; a\r\nspecies of them which are remarkable for their size, grow in the\r\nmarshes, and are greedily eaten by the Raccoon: they are therefore\r\ncalled marsh grapes, but the English call them fox grapes; they have\r\nnot an agreeable flavour, and are seldom eaten by the inhabitants of\r\nthis country, who make use of a small kind of wild grapes, which grow\r\non a dry soil, and pretty late in autumn when they are quite ripe, are\r\neaten raw, and have a very good flavour, being a mixture of sweet and\r\nacid: some people dry these grapes when gathered and bake them in\r\ntarts, &c. they likewise make use of them as dried sweetmeats. The\r\nSwedes formerly made a pretty good wine from them; but have now left it\r\noff. However some of the English still press an agreeable liquor from\r\nthese grapes, which they assured me was as good as the best claret, and\r\nthat it would keep for several years.\r\n\r\nThe manner of preparing this sort of wine has been described at large\r\nin an almanack of this country, for the year 1743, and is as follows:\r\nthe grapes are collected from the twenty first of September to about\r\nthe eleventh of November, that is as they grow ripe: they must be\r\ngathered in dry weather, and after the dew is gone off: the grapes are\r\ncleared of the cobwebs, dry leaves, and other things adhering to them.\r\nNext a great hogshead is prepared which has either had treacle or\r\nbrandy in; it is washed very clean, one of the bottoms beat out, and\r\nthe other placed on a stand for the purpose, or on pieces of wood in\r\nthe cellar, or else in a warm room, about two feet above the ground:\r\nthe grapes are put into this hogshead, and as they sink lower in three\r\nor four days time more are added. A man with naked feet gets into the\r\nhogshead and treads the grapes, and in about half an hour’s time the\r\njuice is forced out; the man then turns the lowest grapes uppermost,\r\nand treads them for about a quarter of an hour: this is sufficient to\r\nsqueeze the good juice out of them: for an additional pressure would\r\neven crush the unripe grapes, and give the whole a disagreeable\r\nflavour. The hogshead is then covered with a thick blanket; but if\r\nthere is no cellar, or it is very cold, two are spread over it. Under\r\nthis covering the juice is left to ferment for the first time, and in\r\nthe next four or five days it ferments and works very strongly. As soon\r\nas the fermentation ceases, a hole is made about six inches from the\r\nbottom, and some of the juice is tapped off about twice in a day. As\r\nsoon as this is clear and settled, it is poured into an anker of a\r\nmiddling size; for from twenty bushels of grapes, they get about as\r\nmany gallons of juice; the anker remains untouched and the must in it\r\nferments a second time: at this time it is necessary that the anker be\r\nquite full; the scum which settles at the bunghole, must be taken off,\r\nand the anker always filled up with more must, which is kept ready for\r\nthat purpose: this is continued till christmas, when the anker may be\r\nstopped up; at last the wine is ready in February and bottled. It is\r\nlikewise usual here, to put some of the ripe grapes into a vessel in\r\norder to make a vinegar, and that which is got by this means is very\r\ngood. Several people made brandy from these grapes which has a very\r\npleasant taste, but is still more pleasant, if the fruits of the\r\npersimon are mixed with it. The wood of these vines is of no use, it is\r\nso brittle that it cannot be used for sticks: on cutting into the stem,\r\na white, insipid resin comes out a few hours after the wound is made.\r\nIn many gardens vines are planted for the purpose of making arbours for\r\nwhich they are indeed excellent; as their large and plentiful leaves\r\nform a very close cover against the scorching heat of the sun. When the\r\nvines flower here in May and June, the flowers exhale a strong, but\r\nexceeding pleasant and refreshing smell, which is perceptible even at a\r\ngreat distance. Therefore on coming into the woods about that time, you\r\nmay judge from the sweet perfume in the air, arising from the flowers\r\nof the vines, that you are near them, though you do not see them.\r\nThough the winters be ever so severe, yet they do not affect the vines.\r\nEach grape is about the size of a pea, but further southward they are\r\nsaid to be of the size of common raisins, and of a finer flavour.\r\nFurther up in the country, during a part of autumn, they are the chief\r\nfood of bears, who climb up the trees in order to pluck them. People\r\nare of opinion that if the wild vines were cultivated with more care,\r\nthe grapes would grow larger, and more palatable.\r\n\r\nDecember the 5th. I shall here mention two prognosticks of the weather,\r\nwhich were greatly valued here. Some people pretended to foretel that\r\nthe ensuing winter would not be a severe one: this they conjectured\r\nfrom having seen wild geese and other migratory birds go to the south\r\nin October, but return a few days ago in great numbers, and even pass\r\non further to the north. Indeed the ensuing winter was one of the most\r\ntemperate ones.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons likewise assured us that we should have rain before to\r\nmorrow night. The reason they gave for this conjecture was, that this\r\nmorning at sun rising, from their windows they had seen every thing\r\nvery plainly on the other side of the river, so that it appeared much\r\nnearer than usual, and that this commonly foreboded rain. This presage\r\nwas likewise pretty exactly fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe Indians before the arrival of the Europeans, had no notion of the\r\nuse of iron, though that metal was abundant in their country. However\r\nthey knew in some measure how to make use of copper. Some Dutchmen who\r\nlived here, still preserved the old account among them, that their\r\nancestors on their first settling in New York had met with many of the\r\nIndians, who had tobacco pipes of copper, and who made them understand\r\nby signs, that they got them in the neighbourhood: afterwards the fine\r\ncopper mine was discovered, upon the second river between\r\nElizabeth-town and New York. On digging in this mine, the people met\r\nwith holes worked in the mountain, out of which some copper had been\r\ntaken, and they found even some tools, which the Indians probably made\r\nuse of, when they endeavoured to get the metal for their pipes. Such\r\nholes in the mountains have likewise been found in some parts of\r\nPensylvania, viz. below Newcastle towards the sea side, and always some\r\nmarks of a copper ore along with them. Some people have conjectured,\r\nthat the Spaniards, after discovering Mexico, sailed along the coasts\r\nof North America, and landed now and then, in order to enquire whether\r\nany gold or silver was to be met with, and that they perhaps made these\r\nholes in the mountains: but supposing them to have made such a voyage\r\nalong the coasts, they could not immediately have found out the copper\r\nmines; and they probably did not stop to blast this ore, as they were\r\nbent only upon gold and silver; it is therefore almost undoubted that\r\nthe Indians dug these holes: or may we be allowed to suspect that our\r\nold Normans, long before the discoveries of Columbus, came into these\r\nparts and met with such veins of copper, when they sailed to what they\r\ncalled the excellent Wineland, [51] of which our ancient traditional\r\nrecords called Sagor speak, and which undoubtedly was North America.\r\nBut in regard to this, I shall have occasion in the sequel better to\r\nexplain my sentiments. It was remarkable, that in all those places\r\nwhere such holes have lately been found in the mountains, which\r\nmanifestly seem to have been dug by men, they were always covered with\r\na great quantity of earth, as if they were intended to remain hidden\r\nfrom strangers.\r\n\r\nDecember the 6th. On long voyages the sailors sometimes catch such fish\r\nas are known to none of the ship’s company; but as they are very greedy\r\nafter fresh provisions, they seldom abstain from eating them, however\r\nit proves often venturing too much, experience having shown, that their\r\nwant of caution has often cost them their lives, for sometimes\r\npoisonous fish are caught. But there is a method of finding them out,\r\nas I have heard from several captains of ships: it is usual when such\r\nunknown fish are boiled, to put a silver button, or any piece of silver\r\ninto the kettle, which if the fish be poisonous, will turn quite black,\r\nbut if it be not, it will not change: some of the seamen referred to\r\ntheir own repeated experience. [52]\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin and several other gentlemen frequently told me, that a\r\npowerful Indian, who possessed Rhode Island had sold it to the English\r\nfor a pair of spectacles: it is large enough for a prince’s domain, and\r\nmakes a peculiar government at present. This Indian knew to set a true\r\nvalue upon a pair of spectacles: for undoubtedly if those glasses were\r\nnot so plentiful, and only a few of them could be found, they would on\r\naccount of their great use, bear the same price with diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe servants which are made use of in the English American colonies are\r\neither free persons, or slaves, and the former are again of two\r\ndifferent sorts.\r\n\r\n1. Those who are quite free serve by the year, they are not only\r\nallowed to leave their service at the expiration of their year, but may\r\nleave it at any time when they do not agree with their masters. However\r\nin that case they are in danger of losing their wages, which are very\r\nconsiderable. A man servant who has some abilities, gets between\r\nsixteen and twenty pounds in Pensylvania currency, but those in the\r\ncountry do not get so much. A servant maid gets eight or ten pounds a\r\nyear: these servants have their food besides their wages, but must buy\r\ntheir own clothes, and what they get of these they must thank their\r\nmaster’s goodness for.\r\n\r\n2. The second kind of free servants consist of such persons as annually\r\ncome from Germany, England and other countries, in order to settle\r\nhere. These new comers are very numerous every year: there are old and\r\nyoung ones, and of both sexes; some of them have fled from oppression,\r\nunder which they supposed themselves to have laboured. Others have been\r\ndriven from their country by persecution on account of religion; but\r\nmost of them are poor, and have not money enough to pay their passage,\r\nwhich is between six and eight pounds sterling for each person;\r\ntherefore they agree with the captain that they will suffer themselves\r\nto be sold for a few years, on their arrival. In that case the person\r\nwho buys them, pays the freight for them, but frequently very old\r\npeople come over, who cannot pay their passage, they therefore sell\r\ntheir children, so that they serve both for themselves and for their\r\nparents: there are likewise some who pay part of their passage, and\r\nthey are sold only for a short time. From these circumstances it\r\nappears, that the price of the poor foreigners who come over to North\r\nAmerica is not equal, and that some of them serve longer than others:\r\nwhen their time is expired, they get a new suit of clothes from their\r\nmaster, and some other things: he is likewise obliged to feed and\r\nclothe them during the years of their servitude. Many of the Germans\r\nwho come hither, bring money enough with them to pay their passage, but\r\nrather suffer themselves to be sold, with a view that during their\r\nservitude they may get some knowledge of the language and quality of\r\nthe country, and the like, that they may the better be able to consider\r\nwhat they shall do when they have got their liberty. Such servants are\r\ntaken preferable to all others, because they are not so dear; for to\r\nbuy a Negroe or black slave, requires too much money at once; and men\r\nor maids who get yearly wages, are likewise too dear; but this kind of\r\nservants may be got for half the money, and even for less; for they\r\ncommonly pay fourteen pounds, Pensylvania currency, for a person who is\r\nto serve four years, and so on in proportion. Their wages therefore are\r\nnot above three pounds Pensylvania currency per ann. This kind of\r\nservants, the English call servings. When a person has bought such a\r\nservant for a certain number of years, and has an intention to sell him\r\nagain, he is at liberty to do so; but he is obliged, at the expiration\r\nof the term of the servitude to provide the usual suit of cloaths for\r\nthe servant, unless he has made that part of the bargain with the\r\npurchaser. The English and Irish commonly sell themselves for four\r\nyears, but the Germans frequently agree with the captain before they\r\nset out, to pay him a certain sum of money, for a certain number of\r\npersons; as soon as they arrive in America, they go about and try to\r\nget a man who will pay the passage for them. In return they give\r\naccording to the circumstances one, or several of their children to\r\nserve a certain number of years, at last they make their bargain with\r\nthe highest bidder.\r\n\r\n3. The Negroes or Blacks make the third kind. They are in a manner\r\nslaves; for when a Negro is once bought, he is the purchaser’s servant\r\nas long as he lives, unless he gives him to another, or makes him free.\r\nHowever it is not in the power of the master to kill his Negro for a\r\nfault, but he must leave it to the magistrates to proceed according to\r\nthe laws. Formerly the Negroes were brought over from Africa, and\r\nbought by almost every one who could afford it. The quakers alone\r\nscrupled to have slaves; but they are no longer so nice, and they have\r\nas many Negroes as other people. However many people cannot conquer the\r\nidea of its being contrary to the laws of christianity to keep slaves.\r\nThere are likewise several free Negroes in town, who have been lucky\r\nenough to get a very zealous quaker for their master, who gave them\r\ntheir liberty, after they had faithfully served him for some time.\r\n\r\nAt present they seldom bring over any Negroes to the English colonies,\r\nfor those which were formerly brought thither have multiplied\r\nconsiderably. In regard to their marriage they proceed as follows: in\r\ncase you have not only male but likewise female Negroes, they must\r\nintermarry, and then the children are all your slaves: but if you\r\npossess a male Negro only, and he has an inclination to marry a female\r\nbelonging to a different master, you do not hinder your Negro in so\r\ndelicate a point; but it is no advantage to you, for the children\r\nbelong to the master of the female; it is therefore advantageous to\r\nhave Negro-women. A man who kills his Negro must suffer death for it:\r\nthere is not however an example here of a white man’s having been\r\nexecuted on this account. A few years ago it happened that a master\r\nkilled his slave; his friends and even the magistrates secretly advised\r\nhim to leave the country, as otherwise they could not avoid taking him\r\nprisoner, and then he would be condemned to die according to the laws\r\nof the country, without any hopes of saving him. This lenity was\r\nemployed towards him, that the Negroes might not have the satisfaction\r\nof seeing a master executed for killing his slave; for this would lead\r\nthem to all sorts of dangerous designs against their masters, and to\r\nvalue themselves too much.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes were formerly brought from Africa, as I mentioned before;\r\nbut now this seldom happens, for they are bought in the West Indies, or\r\nAmerican Islands, whither they were originally brought from their own\r\ncountry: for it has been found that on transporting the Negroes from\r\nAfrica, immediately into these northern countries, they have not such a\r\ngood state of health, as when they gradually change places, and are\r\nfirst carried from Africa to the West Indies, and from thence to North\r\nAmerica. It has frequently been found, that the Negroes cannot stand\r\nthe cold here so well as the Europeans or whites; for whilst the latter\r\nare not in the least affected by the cold, the toes and fingers of the\r\nformer are frequently frozen. There is likewise a material difference\r\namong them in this point; for those who come immediately from Africa,\r\ncannot bear the cold so well as those who are either born in this\r\ncountry, or have been here for a considerable time; for the frost\r\neasily hurts the hands or feet of the Negroes which come from Africa,\r\nor occasions violent pains in their whole body, or in some parts of it,\r\nthough it does not at all affect those who have been here for some\r\ntime. There are frequent examples that the Negroes on their passage\r\nfrom Africa, if it happens in winter, have some of their limbs\r\ndestroyed by frost on board the ship, when the cold is but very\r\ninconsiderable and the sailors are scarce obliged to cover their hands.\r\nI was even assured, that some Negroes have been seen here, who have had\r\nan excessive pain in their legs, which afterwards broke in the middle,\r\nand dropt entirely from the body, together with the flesh on them. Thus\r\nit is the same case with men here, as with plants which are brought\r\nfrom the southern countries, and cannot accustom themselves to a colder\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe price of Negroes differs according to their age, health and\r\nabilities. A full grown Negro costs from forty pounds and upwards to a\r\nhundred of Pensylvania currency. There are even examples that a\r\ngentleman has paid hundred pounds for a black slave at Philadelphia,\r\nand refused to sell him again for the same money. A Negro boy, or girl,\r\nof two or three years old, can hardly be got for less than eight or\r\nfourteen pounds in Pensylvanian currency. Not only the quakers, but\r\nlikewise several christians of other denominations sometimes set their\r\nNegroes at liberty. This is done in the following manner: when a\r\ngentleman has a faithful Negro who has done him great services, he\r\nsometimes declares him independent at his death. This is however very\r\nexpensive; for they are obliged to make a provision for the Negro thus\r\nset at liberty, to afford him subsistence when he is grown old, that he\r\nmay not be driven by necessity to wicked actions, or that he may be at\r\nany body’s charge, for these free Negroes become very lazy and indolent\r\nafterwards. But the children which the free Negro has begot during his\r\nservitude are all slaves, though their father be free. On the other\r\nhand those Negro children are free whose parents are at liberty. The\r\nNegroes in the North American colonies are treated more mildly, and fed\r\nbetter than those in the West Indies. They have as good food as the\r\nrest of the servants, and they possess equal advantages in all things,\r\nexcept their being obliged to serve their whole life time, and get no\r\nother wages than what their master’s goodness allows them: they are\r\nlikewise clad at their master’s expence. On the contrary, in the West\r\nIndies, and especially in the Spanish Islands they are treated very\r\ncruelly; therefore no threats make more impression upon a Negro here,\r\nthan that of sending him over to the West Indies, in case he would not\r\nreform. It has likewise been frequently found by experience, that when\r\nyou show too much remissness to these Negroes, they grow so obstinated,\r\nthat they will no longer do any thing but of their own accord:\r\ntherefore a strict discipline is very necessary, if their master\r\nexpects to be satisfied with their services.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1620, some Negroes were brought to North America in a Dutch\r\nship, and in Virginia they bought twenty of them. These are said to\r\nhave been the first that came hither. When the Indians who were then\r\nmore numerous in the country than at present, saw these black people\r\nfor the first time, they thought they were a true breed of Devils, and\r\ntherefore they called them Manitto for a great while: this word in\r\ntheir language signifies not only God, but likewise the Devil. Some\r\ntime before that, when they saw the first European ship on their\r\ncoasts, they were perfectly persuaded that God himself was in the ship.\r\nThis account I got from some Indians, who preserved it among them as a\r\ntradition which they had received from their ancestors: therefore the\r\narrival of the Negroes seemed to them to have confused every thing; but\r\nsince that time, they have entertained less disagreeable notions of the\r\nNegroes, for at present many live among them, and they even sometimes\r\nintermarry, as I myself have seen.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes have therefore been upwards of a hundred and thirty years\r\nin this country: but the winters here especially in New England and New\r\nYork, are as severe as our Swedish winters. I therefore very carefully\r\nenquired whether the cold had not been observed, to affect the colour\r\nof the Negroes, and to change it, so that the third or fourth\r\ngeneration from the first that came hither, were not so black as their\r\nancestors. But I was generally answered, that there was not the least\r\ndifference of colour to be perceived; and that a Negro born here of\r\nparents which were likewise born in this country, and whose ancestors\r\nboth men and women had all been blacks born in this country, up to the\r\nthird or fourth generation, was not at all different in colour, from\r\nthose Negroes who are brought directly over from Africa. From hence\r\nmany people conclude, that a Negro or his posterity do not change\r\ncolour, though they continue ever so long in a cold climate; but the\r\nmixing of a white man with a Negro woman, or of a Negro with a white\r\nwoman has a different effect, therefore to prevent any disagreeable\r\nmixtures of the white people and Negroes, and that the Negroes may not\r\nform too great an opinion of themselves, to the disadvantage of their\r\nmasters, I am told there is a law made prohibiting the whites of both\r\nsexes to marry Negroes, under pain of death, and deprivation of the\r\nclergyman who marries them: but that the whites and blacks sometimes\r\nmix, appears from children of a mixed complexion, which are sometimes\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise greatly to be pitied, that the masters of these Negroes\r\nin most of the English colonies take little care of their spiritual\r\nwelfare, and let them live on in their pagan darkness. There are even\r\nsome, who would be very ill pleased at, and would by all means hinder\r\ntheir Negroes from being instructed in the doctrines of christianity,\r\nto this they are partly led by the conceit of its being shameful, to\r\nhave a spiritual brother or sister among so despicable a people, partly\r\nby thinking that they should not be able to keep their Negroes so\r\nmeanly afterwards; and partly through fear of the Negroes growing too\r\nproud, on seeing themselves upon a level with their masters in\r\nreligious matters.\r\n\r\nSeveral writings are well known, which mention, that the Negroes in\r\nSouth America have a kind of poison with which they kill each other,\r\nthough the effect is not sudden, but happens a long time after the\r\nperson has taken it: the same dangerous art of poisoning is known by\r\nthe Negroes in North America, as has frequently been experienced.\r\nHowever only a few of them know the secret, and they likewise know the\r\nremedy against it, therefore when a Negro feels himself poisoned and\r\ncan recollect the enemy, who might possible have given him the poison,\r\nhe goes to him, and endeavours by money and entreaties to move him to\r\ndeliver him from the poison; but if the Negro is malicious, he does not\r\nonly deny that he ever poisoned him, but likewise that he knows a\r\nremedy against it: this poison does not kill immediately, for sometimes\r\nthe sick person dies some years after. But from the moment he has the\r\npoison he falls into a consumption and enjoys few days of good health:\r\nsuch a poor wretch often knows that he is poisoned, the moment he gets\r\nthe poison. The Negroes commonly employ it on such of their brethren as\r\nbehave well, are beloved by their masters, and separate as it were from\r\ntheir countrymen, or do not like to converse with them. They have\r\nlikewise often other reasons for their enmity; but there are few\r\nexamples of their having poisoned their masters. Perhaps the mild\r\ntreatment they receive, keeps them from doing it, or perhaps they fear\r\nthat they may be discovered, and that in such a case, the severest\r\npunishments would be inflicted on them.\r\n\r\nThey never discover what the poison consists of, and keep it secret\r\nbeyond conception. It is probable that it is a very common thing which\r\nmay be got all the world over, for wherever they are they can always\r\neasily procure it. Therefore it cannot be a plant, as several learned\r\nmen have thought; for that is not to be met with every where. I have\r\nheard many accounts here of Negroes who have been killed by this\r\npoison. I shall only mention one incident which happened during my stay\r\nin this country. A man here had a Negro who was exceedingly faithful to\r\nhim, and behaved so well, that he would not have given him for twenty\r\nother Negroes. His master likewise shewed him a peculiar kindness, and\r\nthe slave’s conduct equalled that of the best christian servant; he\r\nlikewise conversed as little as possible with the other Negroes; on\r\nthat account they hated him to excess, but as he was scarce ever in\r\ncompany with them, they had no opportunity of conveying the poison to\r\nhim, which they had often tried. However on coming to town during the\r\nfair (for he lived in the country) some other Negroes invited him to\r\ndrink with them. At first he would not, but they pressed him till he\r\nwas obliged to comply. As soon as he came into the room, the others\r\ntook a pot from the wall and pledged him, desiring him to drink\r\nlikewise: he drank, but when he took the pot from his mouth, he said\r\nwhat beer is this? It is full of ******. I purposely omit what he\r\nmentioned, for it seems undoubtedly to have been the name of the poison\r\nwith which malicious Negroes do so much harm, and which is to be met\r\nwith almost every where. It might be too much employed to wicked\r\npurposes, and it is therefore better that it remains unknown. The other\r\nNegroes and Negro-women fell a laughing at the complaints of their\r\nhated countryman, and danced and sung as if they had done an excellent\r\naction, and had at last obtained the point so much wished for. The\r\ninnocent Negro went away immediately, and when he got home, said that\r\nthe other Negroes had certainly poisoned him: he then fell into a\r\nconsumption, and no remedy could prevent his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          End of Vol. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole Sheet Map of a great Part of North America, intended for the\r\nIllustration of these Travels, could not be got ready in Time for the\r\nfirst Volume, on Account of its Size and the great many Names of Places\r\nbrought into it, which must give it a Superiority above any Map\r\nhitherto published of this Part of the World: but the Translator hopes,\r\nthe Public will the more readily excuse this Omission, as it will\r\ngreatly tend to make the Map more perfect, and as the second Volume\r\nwill soon appear, where it shall undoubtedly be inserted.\r\n\r\nAt the same Time he intreats the Encouragers of this Work to compleat\r\nthe Subscriptions for the second Volume, and to favour him with the\r\nLists of Subscribers as soon as possible; and if any more Gentlemen\r\nwill favour him with their Subscriptions, he will look upon it as an\r\nincentive the more vigorously to go on with the rest of the\r\nPublication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The same opinion has been confirmed by Mr. Buffon in his Hist.\r\nNaturelle. tom. 1. art. xix.

F.\r\n\r\n[2] The name of Porpesse is certainly derived from the name Porcopesce,\r\ngiven to this genus by the Italians; and it is remarkable that almost\r\nall the European nations conspired in calling them Sea-hogs, their name\r\nbeing in German Meer Schwein; the Danish, Swedish, and Norvegian,\r\nMarsuin, from whence the French borrowed their Marsouin. The natives of\r\nIceland call them Suinhual, i.e. a Swine-whale, and so likewise the\r\nSlavonian nations have their Swinia Morskaya. Whether this consent\r\narises from their rooting the sand at the bottom of the sea in quest of\r\nSand-eels and Sea-worms like swine, or from the vast quantity of lard\r\nsurrounding their bodies is uncertain. F.\r\n\r\n[3] Mr. Kalm is certainly mistaken in reckoning the Bottle-nose amongst\r\nthe Dolphin kind; it has no teeth in its mouth as all the fish of that\r\nclass have, and therefore belongs to the first order of the Whales, or\r\nthose that are without teeth. See Mr. Pennant’s British Zoology, Vol.\r\n3. p. 43. where it is called the beaked Whale, and very well described;\r\na drawing is seen in the explanatory table, n. I. Perhaps it would not\r\nbe improper to call it Balæna ampullata. F.\r\n\r\n[4] In Mr. Pennant’s British Zoology vol. 3. p. 282. is the best\r\naccount of this fish to be met with; and in his British Zoology,\r\nillustrated by Plates and brief explanations is plate xliv. a good and\r\nexact drawing of the fish, the upper figure representing it in front,\r\nthe lower sideways.

F.\r\n\r\n[15] The English reader, who is perhaps not so well acquainted with the\r\nweather of the Swedish autumn, may form an idea of it, by having\r\nrecourse to the Calendarium Floræ, or the botanical and œconomical\r\nalmanack of Sweden, in Dr. Linnæus’s Amœn.

P.\r\n\r\n[18] This has all the appearance of a vulgar error: neither does the\r\nsucceeding account of the American bears being carnivorous, agree with\r\nthe observations of the most judicious travellers, who deny the fact.\r\nP.\r\n\r\nBut however it might be easible to reconcile both opinions. For Europe\r\nhas two or three kinds of bears, one species of which is carnivorous,\r\nthe other lives only on vegetables: the large brown species, with its\r\nsmall variety, are reputed to be carnivorous, the black species is\r\nmerely phytivorous. In case therefore both species are found in North\r\nAmerica, it would be very easy to account for their being both\r\ncarnivorous and not. F.\r\n\r\n[19] Quartzum hyalinum, Linn.

F.\r\n\r\n[21] How far this approbation of the Royal Society, ought to be\r\ncredited, is to be understood from the advertisements published at the\r\nhead of each new volume of the Philosophical Transactions. F.\r\n\r\n[22] Thomas Herriot, servant to Sir Walter Raleigh, who was employed by\r\nhim to examine into the productions of North America, makes no mention\r\nof the peach among the other fruits he describes, and M. du Pratz, who\r\nhas given a very good account of Louisiana and the Missisippi, says,\r\nthat the natives got their peaches from the English colony of Carolina,\r\nbefore the French settled there. P.\r\n\r\n[23] These worms are the Larva’s of the Oestrus or Gadfly, which\r\ndeposits its eggs on the back of cattle, and the Larva’s being hatched\r\nfrom these eggs, cause great sores, wherein they live till they are\r\nready for their change. In the south of Russia they use for the same\r\npurpose the decoction of Veratrum, or the white Hellebore. F.\r\n\r\n[24] The bones and tusks of Elephants are not only found in Russia, but\r\nalso in the canton of Basel in Swisserland, in the dominions of the\r\nMarquis of Bareith in Franconia, and more instances are found in the\r\nProtogæa of the celebrated Leibnitz. Lately near the river Ohio have\r\nbeen discovered, a great number of skeletons of Elephants with their\r\ntusks, and very remarkable grinders still sticking in their jaw bones\r\nwere sent to the British Museum; the late Dr. Littleton Bishop of\r\nCarlisle, also lodged some teeth sticking in their jawbones in the\r\nMuseum of the Royal Society, which were brought from Peru. The rivers\r\nChatunga and Indighirka in Siberia, are remarkable for affording on\r\ntheir banks great quantities of bones and tusks of Elephants, which\r\nbeing preserved there by the great frost, and in the short summer of a\r\nfew weeks, the rain being rare, these tusks are commonly so fresh that\r\nthey are employed in Russia, as common ivory, on account of the great\r\nquantity brought from these places to Russia; some of them were eight\r\nfeet long, and of three hundred pounds weight. There have been found\r\ngrinders of nine inches diameter. But the American grinders of\r\nElephants from near the Ohio are yet more remarkable, on account of\r\ntheir being provided with crowns on their tops, such as are only found\r\nin the carnivorous animals, and such as feed on hard bones or nuts.\r\nWhilst on the contrary, Elephants at present feeding on grasses and\r\nsoft vegetables have no such crowns at the tops of their grinders.\r\nLivy, it is true, makes a distinction between the Asiatic or Indian\r\nElephants, and the African ones; and remarks the latter to be inferior\r\nto the former in size and vigour; but whether the teeth in these\r\nanimals are so much different from those of the other variety, has\r\nnever been attended to. This circumstance of the difference in the\r\nfossil grinders of Elephants, from those in the living ones, and the\r\nplace where these skeletons were found in, viz. Siberia, Germany and\r\nAmerica, where at present no Elephants are to be met with, opens a wide\r\nfield to conjectures in regard to the way, by which these animals were\r\ncarried to those spots. The flood in the deluge perhaps has carried\r\nthem thither; nor is it contrary to reason, history or revelation, to\r\nbelieve, these skeletons to be the remainders of animals, which lived\r\non the surface of this globe, anterior to the Mosaic creation, which\r\nmay be considered only as a new modification of the creatures living on\r\nthis globe, adapted to its present state, under which it will remain\r\ntill circumstances will make a new change necessary, and then our globe\r\nwill by a new creation of revolution appear more adapted to its state,\r\nand be stocked with a set of animals more suitable to that state. Every\r\nman used to philosophy and reasoning will find, that this plan gives a\r\ngrand idea of the Creator, his œconomy and management of the universe:\r\nand moreover, it is conformable to the meaning of the words of a sacred\r\nwriter, who says: Ps. civ. 29. 30. Thou bidest thy face and they (small\r\nand great beasts) are troubled; thou takest away their breath, they\r\ndie, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are\r\ncreated; and thou renewest the fact of the earth. See Dr. Hunter’s\r\nremarks on the above-mentioned teeth, in the Philosophical Trans. Vol.\r\nlviii. F.\r\n\r\n[25] In Mr. Osbeck’s Voyage to China, Vol I. p. 50. in a note, an\r\naccount is given of this kind of land, which the Swedes call\r\nSwedieland, where it is observed, that the trees being burnt, their\r\nashes afford manure sufficient for three years, after which they are\r\nleft uncultivated again, till after twenty or more years, a new\r\ngeneration of trees being produced on them, the country people burn\r\nthem, and cultivate the country for three years again. F.\r\n\r\n[26] The learned Dr. Wallerius, in his Mineralogy, §. 8. in the note to\r\nthe article, Humus communis atra, mentions that some people were of\r\nopinion, that the mould of our globe increased their parts, especially\r\nin such places as had been uncultivated ever since the deluge, and that\r\nthus in a hundred years, half an inch of mould was produced. But he\r\nobserves in the same time, that this observation was not at all exact;\r\nfor as the common mould seldom exceeds a soot, it must from thence\r\nfollow, that since the deluge no more than 2400 years were elapsed,\r\nthough the scripture chronology reckons upwards of 4000 years since\r\nthat event: besides this, he remarks, that mould always becomes more\r\ndry and compressed, where it is out of the reach, of rain and snow; and\r\nwhere it is exposed to rain, it is carried off to lower places, and\r\ntherefore increases and decreases according to the qualities of its\r\nlocal situation. Moreover, vegetables it is known prosper the best\r\nwhere mould is found. As the surface of our globe has been covered with\r\nvegetables since the deluge, they must have had a mould to grow in ever\r\nsince that time; consequently it is highly probable, that there must\r\nhave been a mould covering the surface of our globe, ever since the\r\nfirst origin. I should be led by some other confederations, to doubt of\r\nthe infallibility of this rule for the increase of mould. In Russia, on\r\nthis side the river Volga, are high and extensive plains, which have\r\nbeen uncultivated ever since the deluge, for we know from history, that\r\nthe Scythians, Sarmatians, Huns, Chazars, and Mogols, were successively\r\nthe masters of these vast countries, and were altogether nomadic\r\nnations, who lived without agriculture; the country has been without\r\nwood since time immemorial, nor could there even spring up any wood\r\nwhatsoever, since its rambling possessors every spring set fire to the\r\nold dry grass, in order to make room for the new grass, which in the\r\nlatter end of May, I found come up very near to my waist. And these\r\nvast, desart plains, I saw every where covered with at lead two feet\r\nmould; nay, in some places it amounted to four feet; this would give\r\naccording to the former rule of half an inch per Century, 4800 years,\r\nin the first instance, and in the second, 9600 years, and therefore\r\nshews that this rule for calculating the increase of mould, is very\r\nprecarious. The chemical analysis of plants, shews that they consist of\r\nwater, earth, acid, alkali, oil, and an inflammable principle,\r\nindependent of the last substance, and called by a late German chemist\r\nthe caustic: these substances must enter yearly the new plants, and\r\nmake their substance, and are as it were regenerated in these new\r\nplants, after being set at liberty from the structure of the last\r\nyear’s plants by putrefaction, or by fire. Mould chemically examined,\r\nhas the same analogous parts. Acid and caustic are plentifully\r\ncontained in the common air, and may also easily be restored to the\r\nmould, and thus circulate through a new system of plants. Water comes\r\nlikewise from rain and snow, out of our atmosphere: alkaline and oily\r\nparticles, or a kind of soap, are the only things wanting, which when\r\nadded with the former to any subtle earth, will make a good mould, and\r\nthese are produced by putrefaction or fire, from vegetable and animal\r\nsubstances, and are the great promoters of vegetation.\r\n\r\nBut the great question is, from whence these various substances\r\nnecessary for vegetation originally came? To believe they are produced\r\nfrom putrified vegetables is begging the question, and making a\r\ncirculus vitiosus in the argument. There is therefore no evasion; they\r\nwere certainly produced by the great Creator of the universe, and\r\nendowed with such qualities, as make them capable of producing in\r\nvarious mixtures new bodies; and when they are introduced by moisture,\r\ninto the first stamina of a plant, or a seed, they expand these\r\nstamina, and constitute a new being, capable of affording food to the\r\nanimal creation. It is evident, Mr. Kalm hinted at the above-mentioned\r\nopinion of the increase of mould, and this gave me an opportunity of\r\nconfirming his argument, and of stating fairly the great question oh\r\nwhich agriculture, the most necessary branch of human arts depends. F.\r\n\r\n[27] As the shells of oysters are a marine animal production, and their\r\ncavities are full of particles of sea-water, the moisture of it flies\r\noff, leaving behind its salt; when the shells are burnt, and the lime\r\nis slacked, the salt mixes with the lime: and though the mortar of such\r\na lime grows ever so dry, the particles of salt immediately attract the\r\nmoisture of the air, and cause that dampness complained of here. F.\r\n\r\n[28] Though Mr. Kalm has so carefully avoided peopling Europe with this\r\ninsect, yet Dr. Linnæus assures us in his Systema Naturæ, that the\r\nsouthern countries of Europe are already infested with it; Scopoli\r\nmentions it among his Insecta Carniolica p. 63. and Geoffroy among his\r\nParisian Insects, Vol. 1. p. 267. t. 4. f. 9. has given a fine figure\r\nof it. F.\r\n\r\n[29] Diss. de Noxa Insectorum, Amœn. Acad. Vol. 3. p. 347.\r\n\r\n[30] In his Systema Naturæ, he calls it Bruchus Pisi, or the Pease\r\nBeetle; and says that the Gracula Quiscula, or Purple daw of Catesby,\r\nis the greatest destroyer of them, and though this bird has been\r\nproscribed by the legislature of Pensylvania, New Jersey, and New\r\nEngland as a maize-thief, they feel however the imprudence of\r\nextirpating this bird; for a quantity of worms which formerly were\r\neaten by these birds destroy their meadows at present. F.\r\n\r\n[31] If the pease were steeped before they are sown, in a lie of lime\r\nwater and some dissolved arsenic, the pupa or aurelia of the insect\r\nwould be killed. F.\r\n\r\n[32] Mr. Miller describes this liquor in his Gardener’s Dictionary\r\nunder the article of Convolvulus, species the 17th. and 18th.\r\n\r\n[33] This animal is probably the Sorex cristatus of Dr. Linnæus, who\r\nsays it is like the mole and lives in Pensylvania. F.\r\n\r\n[34] The same is to be met with in Edwards’s Natural History of Birds,\r\npage 38. tab. 38. F.\r\n\r\n[35] There is a much lesser species of humming-bird, by Linnæus called\r\nTrochilus minimus, being the least bird known; Sir Hans Sloane’s living\r\none, weighed only twenty grains, and Mr. Edwards’s dry one forty-five.\r\nIt is drawn in Edwards’s birds, t. 150, in its natural size, together\r\nwith its egg. F.\r\n\r\n[36] The author seems to comprehend more by this word, than what it\r\ncommonly includes, for he describes it as a building, which contains\r\nboth a barn and stables. F.\r\n\r\n[37] This kind of building is frequent in the north of Germany,\r\nHolland, and Prussia, and therefore it is no wonder that it is employed\r\nby people who, were used to them in their own country. F.\r\n\r\n[38] Probably it is a stone marle; a blue and reddish species of this\r\nkind is used with good success, in the county of Bamff in Scotland.\r\n\r\n[39] Dr. Linnæus, in his Travels through Westrogothia, has given a\r\ndrawing of the machine by which woad is prepared, on the 128th. page.\r\n\r\n[40] As there are no Jews in Sweden, Prof. Kalm was an utter stranger\r\nto their manners and religious customs, and therefore relates them as a\r\nkind of novelty. F.\r\n\r\n[41] This has really happened by a greater union and exertion of power\r\nfrom the colonies and the mother country; so that Canada has been\r\nconquered and its possession has been confirmed to Great Britain in the\r\nlast peace. F.\r\n\r\n[42] Of this animal and of the above-mentioned Racoon is a\r\nrepresentation given plate 2. both from original drawings; the German\r\nand the Swedish edition of Prof. Kalm’s work being both without this\r\nplate. F.\r\n\r\n[43] Neither of these accounts appear to be satisfactory; and therefore\r\nI am inclined to believe that these red foxes originally came over from\r\nAsia, (most probably from Kamtchatka where this species is common, see\r\nMiller’s Account of the Navigations of the Russians, &c.) though in\r\nremote times, and thus spread over North America. It is perhaps true\r\nthat the Indians never took notice of them till the Europeans were\r\nsettled among them; this, however, was because they never had occasion\r\nto use their skins: but when there was a demand for these they began to\r\nhunt them, and, as they had not been much accustomed to them before,\r\nthey esteemed them as a novelty. What gives additional confirmation to\r\nthis is, that when the Russians under Commodore Bering landed on the\r\nwestern coast of America, they saw five red foxes which were quite\r\ntame, and seemed not to be in the least afraid of men: now this might\r\nvery well have been the case if we suppose them to have been for many\r\ngenerations in a place where no body disturbed them; but we cannot\r\naccount for it, if we imagine that they had been used to a country\r\nwhere there were many inhabitants, or where they had been much hunted.\r\nF.\r\n\r\n[44] When Captain Amadas, the first Englishman that ever landed in\r\nNorth America, set foot on shore (to use his own words) such a flocke\r\nof Cranes (the most part white) arose under us with such a cry,\r\nredoubled by many ecchoes, as if an armie of men had showted\r\nalltogether.\r\n\r\n[45] Properly shining blackbirds.\r\n\r\n[46] What gives still more weight, to Mr. Kalm’s opinion of the Elk\r\nbeing the Moose-deer, is the name Musu which the Algonkins give to the\r\nelk, as Mr. Kalm himself observes in the sequel of his work; and this\r\ncircumstance is the more remarkable, as the Algonkins before the\r\nIrokeese or five nations got so great a power in America, were the most\r\npowerful nation in the northern part of this continent; in so much,\r\nthat though they be now reduced to an inconsiderable number, their\r\nlanguage is however a kind of universal language in North America; so\r\nthat there is no doubt, that the elk is the famous Moose-deer. F.\r\n\r\n[47] It seems to be either the substance commonly called French Chalk,\r\nor perhaps the Soap-rock, which is common in Cornwall near the Lizard\r\npoint, and which consists besides of some particles of talc, chiefly of\r\nan earth like magnesia, which latter with acid of vitriol, yields an\r\nearthy vitriolic, salt, or Epsom salt.

F.\r\n\r\n[49] It has been observed, that only such squirrels and birds as have\r\ntheir nests near the place where such snakes come to, make this pitiful\r\nnoise, and are so busy in running up and down the tree and the\r\nneighbouring branches, in order to draw off the attention of the snake\r\nfrom their brood, and often they come so very near in order to fly away\r\nagain, that being within reach of the snakes, they are at last bit,\r\npoisoned and devoured; and this will, I believe, perfectly account for\r\nthe powers of fascinating birds and small creatures in the snakes. F.\r\n\r\n[50] As Catesby and Edwards have both represented the flying Squirrel\r\nin a sitting attitude, I have given here, plate I. a figure of one with\r\nthe expanded membrane, and joined to it on the same plate, a more\r\naccurate figure of the ground Squirrel.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet made out with certainty, whether the American flying\r\nsquirrel, and that found in Finland and in the north of Europe and\r\nAsia, be the same animal. The American kind has a flat pennated tail,\r\nbut the European kind a round one, which affords a very distinguishing\r\ncharacter. F.\r\n\r\n[51] See for this opinion the scarce and curious work intitled, Torfæi\r\nhistoria Vinlandiæ antiquæ seu partis Americæ septentrionalis. Hafniæ\r\n1715. 4to. F.\r\n\r\n[52] This experiment with the silver, supposes that the broth of the\r\nfish would be so strong as to act as a solvent upon the silver; but\r\nthere may be poisons, which would not affect the silver, and however\r\nprove fatal to men; the surest way therefore would be to suppress that\r\nappetite, which may become fatal not only to a few men of the crew, but\r\nalso endanger the whole ship, by the loss of necessary hands.
